[Hook: Problem]
I don't like to think
I just like to drink
I just like to smoke
All my bitches do coke
And we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck
Middle fingers up

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
AR-Fif with green beam
Cream soda with Wyclean
Money greener than broccoli
Speakers kick like Bruce Lee
I ball with Fiji water
I chase money like bank robber
I didn't mean to not call her
I couldn't find my phone charger
My mouth looks like ice hockey
Diamonds dancing like Jabbawockeez
It's Versace Dennis the Menace
Rain dancing outside of Lenox
Mr. Jody Highroller, Mr. syrup in me soda
I enter women's bathroom stall
Shave snowflakes off a golf ball

[Hook: Problem]
I don't like to think
I just like to drink
I just like to smoke
All my bitches do coke
And we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck
Middle fingers up

[Verse 2: Problem]
Problem
Came in with a gang of booms like a motherfucking gong
Clown' RIFF RAFF my G now a nigga doing songs
Like that pink haired cracker crazy
Man what the fuck is wrong with him
But bro be lit as fuck plus he keep a pack of broads with him
He needed an ounce of that Tony Montana he heard that I knew the plug
Then he did a long line like ugly hoes outside the club
They fresh they fucking clean, it's like my clothes was made of Dove
Murdered the whole scene, hey OJ, they found our glove

[Hook: Problem]
I don't like to think
I just like to drink
I just like to smoke
All my bitches do coke
And we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck
Middle fingers up
