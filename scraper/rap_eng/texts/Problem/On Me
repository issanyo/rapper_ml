[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Rollin, pockets on Bruce Bruce by Louken
Coming from colors like fruit loops remove goose
Hoes right behind me in 2 groups they too loose
Balling on me running through niggas bitches that shoot hoops cruise
'93 magic blue on Shaq feet
Back like the bitch ran track ass like athletes
Tight up in them jeans so please swing that pass me
Finally got that ass bitch, striptease me last week
I guess I got the dick so I make the rules
When they let the mothernigga play the rules
Strapped up motherfucker better play it cool
FNH 5.7, that's my favorite tool
I'm a fool dog ass nigga
So go play with your kids I'm a grown ass nigga bitch
I'm a fool dog ass nigga
So go play with your kids I'm a grown ass nigga bitch

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
And It's all on me I put it on me
Until the day I die fuck hoes and smoke tree
We blessin' up the yak and rollin OG
Got bottles on the table the tab like 4Gs
And I put it on me, me, me
I put it on me ,me, me
Said It's all on me, me, me
I put it on me, me, me
Said I put it on me

[Verse 2: Problem]
Compton California that's where I'm from
Fuck your girl pussy until it's numb
Do my damn thing and I shake like I'm pimpin
Fakers stay hating long as real niggas recognize
I'm good, yeah yeah I'm good
Taking care of my day ones and feeding all my wolves
2 365's ago I was live you know
Yeah I got off more tree than woods
Nigga its the real, ace of spades a deal
It ain't what you say it's how you say it, you feel
I do it from the chest I reek of success
You ain't seen a nigga this cold out the West in a long time
Say you wanna problem it's a long line
Super hot boy push a cold line
Shining, you staring at a gold mine
I'm on now, showtime

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
And It's all on me I put it on me
Until the day I die fuck hoes and smoke tree
We blessin' up the yak and rollin OG
Got bottles on the table the tab like 4Gs
And I put it on me, me, me
I put it on me ,me, me
Said It's all on me, me, me
I put it on me, me, me
Said I put it on me

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Said it's on me
We smoking OG
I meet up with my nigga
We chopping the whole key
I slap it on the five, he slap it on the G
But yo that's still my folks be close since '93
It's been money over bitches running with my niggas
Hooping with a squad of robbers and dope dealers
Look how these conditions turn children to cold killers
Knowing that the streets don't got mercy on broke niggas
I'm thugging to the East Bay
Hit my nigga jack and said I'm on the freeway
I need another pack of that you know how play
Hit a lick or flipping zippers
I told my girl I'm just that type of nigga
Got my killer from the East Bay
Hit L.A. and got some weight off to a 8th Tray
He broke it down and had my money at the next day
Hit a lick or flipping zippers
Told my girl I'm just that type of nigga

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
And It's all on me I put it on me
Until the day I die fuck hoes and smoke tree
We blessin' up the yak and rollin OG
Got bottles on the table the tab like 4Gs
And I put it on me, me, me
I put it on me ,me, me
Said It's all on me, me, me
I put it on me, me, me
Said I put it on me
