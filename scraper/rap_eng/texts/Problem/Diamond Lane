[Sample]
She rollin' in like Diamond Lane in the Diamond Lane

[Chorus]
Get it, get it bitch
Get it bitch
Get it, get it bitch
Get it, get it bitch
Get it bitch
Get it, get it bitch
Get it, get it bitch
Get it bitch
Get it, get it bitch
Get it, get it bitch
Get it bitch
Get it, get it bitch
What

[Verse 1]
Bust it open
Bust it, bust it open
Got a nigga lookin’ focused
Let's disappear like hocus pocus
Hopefully you 'bout your hustle like them bosses up in Oakland
It don’t mean you have me in no twisters
We headin' in and I'm gon' slug 'em
'Cause we don't play that shit where I'm from
This Diamond Lane, 354
Mi vida lo
I’ma do things to that pussy it ain’t never seen befo'
And hopefully you do things to this dick I ain’t never seen befo'
That pussy's like a gun
You ain't gon’ pop it then what you bring it fo'?

[Chorus]
Get it, get it bitch
Get it bitch
Get it, get it bitch
Get it, get it bitch
Get it bitch
Get it, get it bitch
Get it, get it bitch
Get it bitch
Get it, get it bitch
Get it, get it bitch
Get it bitch
Get it, get it bitch
What

[Verse 2]
Baby lookin' in her finger wanna lick it in between her right now then
So she been plottin' on the real for awhile then
Got three women with her
Told her "Baby y'all can fly away"
But if you ain't about your bag then yo ass ain't allowed in

[Spoken Outro]
If I call you bitches a pet name baby don't take offense to it sorry
