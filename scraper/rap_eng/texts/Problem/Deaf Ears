A lot of phone calls fall on deaf ears nowadays

Phone calls fall on deaf ears nowadays
Bitches like why you do me that way
Niggas like why you do me that way

[Verse 1: Problem + Airplane James]
Pull up the same shit be different now
That's my old flame we ain't speaking now
Dropping new flame oh I'm shit'n now
Think they fucking with us who you kidding now
Don't get outta line be respectful
A1 but they wanna test you
Oh why oh why niggas wanna try
I ain't got no love for the other side
For the other side
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay
I just hit for sixty niggas call me Kobe
Niggas I don't know acting like they know me
Bitch come fuck the homie

[Verse: Problem + Airplane James]
I done made all the change so it's different now
Enemies see the Chach & be dipping out
Hoes love when I'm present put a ribbon round
You be biggin' bitches up I just dick 'em down
Pull up in that new thang or a old school
Independent out the gate I got no rules
Fake boys I'm 'bout to pass like its old news
Nigga grew up in the hood where it's no rules
Police ask me 'bout my nigga I got no clues
Fighting over bitches what I don't do
Fuck your whole crew
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay
Bitch come get to know me
