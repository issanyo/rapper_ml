[Hook: Bryan Johnson (Problem)]
You got me speedin' in the fast lane
And I'm tryna get straight to you
You should prolly share my last name
But it's only one night for you
Spend the night with me, baby
Spend the night with me, baby
Spend the night, spend the night
Spend the night with me, baby
Spend the night with me, baby
Spend the night with me, baby
Ah! (Girl, you know what's up)

[Verse 1: Problem (Bryan Johnson)]
Just finished up, girl, I'm 'bout to be over there
From the other side, I ain't supposed to be over here
Just make sure the bottom lock unlocked
Just in case you fall asleep with the key to mailbox
Bitch fuck with the cookin', know she got somethin' to eat
Have a J ready, smokin' while she rub my feet
Told her "I'm the shit" and she replied "I'm a asshole"
Grab her ponytail while I lick her asshole
With this dick, I'm a natural like an afro
Made her body cum in my Vans, no Astro
Like what? Made it blow like Castro
Like what? Reply, lemme fast forward
What? I'm lit
Take your shot, girl, gimme a kiss
And I'm rubbin' on that ass like I'm tryna make a wish
This next line prolly goin' show I ain't shit
But I wish my bitch made me feel like this
Oh yeah! (Mmm)
She don't (Don't)
So I'm here (Here)
Girl, you know what's up (Oh-oh-oh)

Spend the night with me, baby
Spend the night, spend the night
Spend the night with me, baby
Spend the night with me, baby
Spend the night with me, baby
Ah! (Girl, you know what's up)

[Verse 2: Bad Lucc, (Bryan Johnson) & Problem]
I wanna dance with you
Fatty be lookin' hella cool in it's dancing shoe
I wanna dance with you, cover some plans with you
So she can tell how I move, I done romanced a few
I wanna dance with you
Look at they faces, they all lookin', they fans of you
How can I blame 'em? Just take my hand and let's dance a few
Look at the stance on you, damn! (Oh)
Girl, you know what's up
