I don’t get involved with the shit
Stay calm through the storm the revolver ‘ll flip
Money come by the bags and won't fit in the clip
Wet flows on ten toes, I'm too wavy to slip
Let a hoe be a hoe, I don’t baby a bitch
I’m ownin my shit, that’s clear as the tequila I sip
Life’s funny as these marks that act hood now
Hey Joe, hit this J, put that backwood down
Chach pimp in this game like when that Lac pull ‘round (biatch!)
Get outta pocket it’s over
Centennial high nigga had a a bad one in Culver (on God)
She only like to fuck, she ain't like when I hold her (true)
Imma bang her ass out and send her back to her man
Washed off, got dressed and got back to the plan
Now she getting that

(Chorus)
Get the money nigga, cause anything else ain't fuh me nigga (x3)

Me I'm kinda simple I ain't complex
Bitch nigga miss me with the mind flex
'Cause if its fuck me then its fuck you
Pray that you take that outta context
Baby making turkey bacon with the omelette
Baby tappin' out, I ain't even come yet
High off life, weed ain't even hit the lungs yet
A nigga feelin like a nigga bout to run shit (on God!)
Track shoes laced up
Street money, really never had a pay stub
I'm too 100 I can't fake love
All my bitches think I'm crackin' bruh that ain't love
I'm just doin' me what they hatin' for?
Just closed a new deal they'll be hating more
It ain't nothin worse than to lose a bitch round
Don't believe me, ask Chris Brown
Hold your head up, my young get cracking
You young and you active, you bangin', it's braccin’ (I see you)
But a lot come along with that lifestyle
But you can make your rights right, right now

(Chorus)
Get the money nigga, cause anything else ain't fuh me nigga (x2)

(Outro)
Get the money nigga, cause anything else ain't fuh me nigga (x6)
