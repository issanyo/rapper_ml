[Chorus]
Life's like a hand full of ass so I cup it like a coaster
World driving you crazy roll the weed and get a chauffeur
Couple of puffs and some drink I’m in yo hole like a gopher
She did it cuz I’m a nigga yea I did it for the culture
Yea I did it for the culture
Yea I did it for the culture


[Verse 1]
This is for my niggas locked up sipping pruno playing poker
Time halfway done, just watch yo back and stay focused
The system picking our people cause we young, black and hopeless
Should’ve seen my partners face when that judge slam the gavel
55 wit a L my bros eyes hit the gravel
I’m still stuck like, fuck, we was just clowning in my ‘maro
I remember one night bro called me like, Jay pull up to the barrier
His mom just passed I think he was like 2 weeks removed from the barrier
Eyes red, gun on his lap smoke still coming out the barrel
He’s like dawg I ain't trying to live like this this ain't how its posed to go
But some nigga shot at me so I shot back then shot his ass some mo’
Yea I shot his ass some mo better that than be a victim
God is the only witness I’m leaving so I popped every nigga with me
So that’s like 4 down at least one dead the devil keeping score
Cuh I wasn’t even trying to do that i was just going to the store
Shit I ain't even wanna go but unc’ wanted some Cheetos and a pack of blunts
And I’m staying here rent free so like how imma tell that nigga no
Then I told unc’ about it nigga said that I did what I was ‘posed to
They did it cause they marks, you, you did it for the culture

[Chorus]
Life's like a hand full of ass so I cup it like a coaster
World driving you crazy roll the weed and get a chauffeur
Couple of puffs and some drink I’m in yo hole like a gopher
She did it cuz I’m a nigga yea I did it for the culture
Yea I did it for the culture

[Verse 2]
This here for that bad bitch living on her granny’s sofa
It’s almost go time, just watch yo back and stay focused
The system picking our people cause we young black and hopeless

Should’ve seen baby’s face when the judge slam that gavel
2 years locked up some nigga from her crew said she was the one in that flannel
Baby a cute lil dark skin with a fatty all up under that skirt
But every other morning she in the house call that shit going to work
Shit her momma from east coast they stayed in my momma’s apartment
Over in 11 8 hood but she from the one from up in Carson
I always thought lil momma was way to advanced for her age
She hit 18 and started hanging with them [?] niggas off Western and Gage
At first it was just hanging you know brought niggas drinks and she cooked
Went hunting, hit her first house, shit after that she was hooked
Adrenaline rushing, paper touching, if it ain't nailed down it was took
Day after day it was jerkin she kept a flathead in her purse
But she didn’t know the police was lurking watching a nigga in that crew
Picked him up for attempted murder, over a shooting at a school
Bro gave her up to them people, so his sentence could be shortened
He did what he did cause he’s a mark, her she did it for the culture

[Chorus]
Life's like a hand full of ass so I cup it like a coaster
World driving you crazy roll the weed and get a chauffeur
Couple of puffs and some drink I’m in yo hole like a gopher
She did it cuz I’m a nigga yea I did it for the culture
Yea I did it for the culture
Yea I did it for the culture

Yea I did it for the culture
Yea I did it for the culture
