We gon' run thang all year, all year al-all year

[Verse 1]
Let's get straight off the rip (Get it straight off the rip)
"Woo woo!" to the Bloods talkin' [?] to Crips
Hunnit shots in the vip, and it leaves a hunnit more in the clip!
This that shit they [?]
Still fuck a nigga bitch if I have to
Put any nigga on the track bet I'll lap you
Put some niggas on the map that i didn't have to
And what for you lookin crazy I done slapped you
But nowadays I gotta choose what i react to
Cause gettin money is the only that move me gotcha boppin' my jacuzzi, want drama? No still got the lil' uzi (Yup!)

[Chorus]
We gon' run thang all year, all year

[Verse 2]
B Boy fresh every time you see him
Bad bitches, real niggas wait in line to see him
It ain't about being hot, it's who lasts the longest
You can be these niggas favorites, Whose cash the longest? (Mark!)
Cause the last time I muthafuckin checked
Me and Bird just split another fuckin check
Rap nigga hate cause I'm a muthafuckin threat
In and out the booth I'll bring it to they muthafuckin neck! (Yeeeaah!)
On momma, and grannies too
I let you niggas beat me, then my family through (But no!)
That ain't how my family do
Now lemme show you how Cali move (Really)

[Chorus]
We gon' run thang all year, all year (I mean really tho)
We gon' run thang all year, all year (Y'all done seen it)
Fuck you talkin' bout it's y'all year? Y'all year? (But y'all ain't seen it)
We gon' run thang all year, all year (Whaaat!)
We gon' run thang all year, all year
We gon' run thang all year, all year
Watchu talkin' bout it's y'all year? Y'all year?
We gon' run thang all year, all year al-all year

[Verse 3]
Chachi check the check, Chachi on the loose (Woo!)
Chachi on his tip, Chach don't want a truce
Chachi on the bread, Chachi on ya girl
Already got the city, Chachi want the world! (Whaaat!)
Chachi in the hood with no bodyguards (Facts!)
Chaster hit the hood in all kinda cars
Chachi put his dick in all kinda stars
Then brought em to the hood where all the homies are! (Facts!)
So y'all gon' respect my name, y'all gon respect my game
Get to the exit cause this is the Diamond Lane
With or without my big homies 'round
Stay on your side cause if not then its goin down

[Chorus x2]
We gon' run thang all year, all year (I mean really tho)
We gon' run thang all year, all year (Y'all done seen it)
Fuck you talkin' bout it's y'all year? Y'all year? (But y'all ain't seen it)
We gon' run thang all year, all year (Whaaat!)
We gon' run thang all year, all year
We gon' run thang all year, all year
Watchu talkin' bout it's y'all year? Y'all year?
We gon' run thang all year, all year al-all year
