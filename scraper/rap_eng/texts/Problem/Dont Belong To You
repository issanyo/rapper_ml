[Verse 1]
Girl you fuckin with a rider let me know
Hop yo ass up in the car cuz a nigga gotta go
Chucking deuces to the haters, I’ll be back
Bitches say I’m fake as fuck, I’ll be that
Cause I ain't falling for that shit you hookers do
Every movie there’s a chick that break up a niggas crew
Best friends turn to enemieees
Don't think that it can't happen to you
Here’s the proof
While everybody out here sharing the same hoes
My game to your games
Fuck us then change clothes
Bro I ain't tripping that’s how the game goes
You wifing up a flip we laugh the lame chose
We all been a victim of it one time
But never beefin over that
I need it sometime
I dont know about you boy but
That’s how i run mine
Coined up i got dumb dimes
Hotter than sunshine

[Chorus]
You niggas better stop trippin over these
Tonishas, Tanyas, and Melodys
Young niggas out here committing felonies
Over
Pussy that don’t belong to you
Trying to figure out what you niggas mad for
Got you out here looking like a asshole
Put the gun down ain't no need to blast bro, over
Pussy that don’t belong to you
Pussy that don’t belong to you

[Verse 2]
Life lit so that’s why you niggas livid
Only time the pussys yours is when yo ass is in it
You thought she liked you i know i get it
She gone nut and leave you’re finished
Then call up her crew
Then one of them gone tell her bout a function at Game’s house
And she gone want to go cause she know we bring them thangs out
Weed, bar, free pills, big champagnes out
Now don't get all mad
That pussy ain't yours cause you bought her a bag
That pussy ain't yours cause you paid all her rent
They do us like this, because, niggas ain't shit
Ever since a youngin she seen niggas dog her momma
Now a savage mode go ahead and blame Rihanna
But baby, you ain't got money like Rihanna
You sharing the studio with Keisha and Tiana
So nigga don't react quick
Lil mama just trying to keep her snap lit
And she wanna fuck [?] and she wanna fuck [?]
Because her favorite song is Backflip
Holla back, bitch!

[Chorus]
You niggas better stop trippin over these
Tonishas, Tanyas, and Melodys
Young niggas out here committing felonies
Over
Pussy that don’t belong to you
Trying to figure out what you niggas mad for
Got you out here looking like a asshole
Put the gun down ain't no need to blast bro, over
Pussy that don’t belong to you
Pussy that don’t belong to you

Life lit so thats why you niggas livid
