Verse 2

Gotta get this money don't you interfere!

I can't let this thing go until the bags secure!

Listen here lil mamma,I'm not into Drama

I'm too busy in the streets running up them Commas!

I promise any means I'm a get it,when it comes to the grind I'm committed,I'm for u baby girl don't forget it,but all that extra shhh gone run me off of u don't quit it!

I know u addicted to the "D",ask me how I know cause I'm addicted to the "P"

Gotta get this money,ain't nothing in life free,if we don't get this Bread then it  can't be no "We"

See,money is the motive and the focus when u think I'm out having fun I'm  promoting! Why we trying to fix something girl that ain't broken? KINGLISH is the life that I live not a slogan!

At the same token,I'm doing what I Love,never get it twisted I thank the Man Above

We came along way we ain't gotta sale drugs cause we get the same thing when we walk in the club!
