Chorus:
Girl Im not your last love
Im nothing like your past love
Girl Im trying to last love
But I can't do that witout you

She told me she love me, I sho believed her
She threw that bomb to me like im an Oakland reciever
Body on point, stay sharp as a cleaver, you blow on my reefer she perfers teefas
She bought them Areethras, Franklins everything about her is high maintenance
Her last guy tore her heart up, so ever since then she got her guard up
Though I hate puttin up wit all that (uh) Babys too bomb for da boy to fall back
So when she get mad and dont call back I text her "lets take a ride like a car jack"(uh)
And talk about the shit face to face like I know you played n aquired a few snake bites
(yeah) so lets just pull out the bottle your face dont say it, just show it (show it)

Chorus:
Girl Im sorry bout your last love
But I am not your last love
Girl dont try to last love
But I can't do it without you

(yeah, listen to me)
She swear our future is dark as hennessy
Pimpin's in my blood and she recognize the tendencies
Hold back she ain't even at the plate though
Though she love me, the pain she ain't down to wait for
Done some wrong and I admitted to that shit
My closet might have more bones than catfish
Man put my tool in a box full of ratches
But you make me (ow) and I ain't talkin no cashin love

Girl Im tryin to change the season, yo past is like ya ass
Its behind you fo a reason no lookin side to side
Your vision ya beat tunnel, fight for yo heart
Remind yous a rebel fo real, you no the deal girl
This shit ain't fo play (play) hand him down to do whateva it take(take)
(take, take) yea I mean whateva, one mans trash is another mans treasure (fo real)

Chorus:
Girl Im sorry about your last love
But I am not your last love
Girl Im trying to last love
But I can't do it without you

(Yeah, break it down)
(Yeah) Girl Im not your last love
(Yeah) Im nothin like your past love
(Yeah) Girl Im trying to last love
But I can't do it without you (Problem)
