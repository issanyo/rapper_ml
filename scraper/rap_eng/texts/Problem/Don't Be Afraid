[Intro: Rapsody]
These gangs, these tats, these red and blue chucks
We some chill ass niggas, all you gots to show is love
I used to be afraid of fallin’ deep for a man
Cause my homies always said these fuckers just fans
My nigga, I told ‘em I ain’t scared of no obstacles
You live to die and die to live, that shit is all optional
Listen, you either with it or you isn’t
Here to fuck with my family? I ain’t scared to go to prison

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
(Don’t be afraid)
All my niggas live above the law
You scared of something nigga? Whatchu duckin’ under covers for?
I’m a problem to this game so they want me out
This a warning boy, you entering a haunted house (Don’t be afraid)
Nigga don’t fear it just respect it, adhere to the lesson nigga
(Don’t be afraid) Y’all niggas scared of a gun
My aunt told me fear stand for fuck everything and run

[Verse 1: Problem]
747 on the wakeup, lil mama got makeup all over my spreads
Kick her out then she hop in her Benz
Feeling satisfied, usually she put up a fuss, but I didn’t analyze
Funny, phone ring, it’s probly the money though
Lacing up the all white 1’s with the gummy sole
Check the mirror ‘fore I enter the earth
One thought when I’m hitting the turf

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
(Don’t be afraid)
All my niggas live above the law
You scared of something nigga? Whatchu duckin’ under covers for?
I’m a problem to this game so they want me out
This a warning boy, you entering a haunted house (Don’t be afraid)
Nigga don’t fear it just respect it, adhere to the lesson nigga
(Don’t be afraid) Y’all niggas scared of a gun
My aunt told me fear stand for fuck everything and run

[Verse 2: Bad Lucc]
Nike sweats, Jordan 2’s, don’t mind me I’m just setting the scene
I’m Bad Lucc by the way
I’ve done my share of interesting things, this life I was dealt
Some of the illest verses in these streets of LA was felt
Never turn from my position, my mission was clear
To stand down like a man when whatever sever my fear
Watch me, king of my castle, call your dogs
I’m black Superman above the law

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
(Don’t be afraid)

[Verse 3: Problem]
Huh, you see your enemy riding by and you realise
You ain’t got nine lives pussy
Old school player, I am beyond rookie
Schoolin’ everyday, no hookie
50k up under the black hoodie, no floss
Sucker shit I ain’t buying at no cost
Got five kids, I’mma put ‘em all in matching drop [?]
Talib drop this

[Verse 4: Rapsody]
I used to be fearful of Chucky and Freddie
I’m the doll they fall for like white chicks
Rick James on the couch shit, I sleep with machetes
Always ready
Mama said “fear no man” like Eddie
From [?] to run like Kunta your fearful eyes tearful, shed one
Cry me a river then drown you, I fear none
Boogie man tap dance on my tongue, boo, nigga
I fear for your career, if you niggas ain’t cool with us holla

[Verse 5: Bad Lucc]
Back to back wine toasts
Yesterday I went to sleep and fucked a fine ghost
In and out my mind Mos
Lee got me in the middle of rhyming my business
Rap gods please forgive us, all of us sinners
Still get a verse full of venom off
[?] Diamond Lane, Indie 500, men at war
I have a harder time with taxes
Knocking the earth off its axis
