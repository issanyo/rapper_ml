League of Starz
Sorry Jaynari
This gon' be your favorite song

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
I see 'em lookin' at my woman
If they ain't lookin', I don’t want that girl

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
If they ain't lookin', I don’t want her
If they ain't lookin', I don’t want her
If they ain't lookin', I don’t want that girl
No

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
Yeah, she bad ain't she?
Why would I wanna keep her to myself?
I know you mad, ain't ya?
'Cause she only want me and no one else
I tell'er put her heels on
So she can show off them legs
But even with her clothes on
She turn heads

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
I see 'em lookin' at my woman
If they ain't lookin', I don’t want that girl

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
If they ain't lookin', I don’t want her
If they ain't lookin', I don’t want her
If they ain't lookin', I don’t want that girl
No

[Verse 2: Problem]
Bad bitches put your hand up
I need to see you
Twerk, twerk it for a real nigga
If your nails done and your weave new
Never be raggedy, hell, you're finer than Vanity mags
100 with everythin', don't be rockin' them shageddy bags
PDA, never shame, when I kiss her, step back like
Look at that frame on that picture
With your bad ass, it's a night, no glad ass
Pretty face with a fat ass
In a dress straight from bad ass, Tennessee
Who she goin' home with? You finna see, nigga

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Ooh, if they ain't lookin', I don’t want that girl
I don’t want that girl

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
If they ain't lookin', I don’t want her
If they ain't lookin', I don’t want her
If they ain't lookin', I don’t want that girl
No

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
If they ain't looking at my baby
Then it’s something wrong with me
If they ain't hating on what we got
I'ma need a new woman
If they ain't looking at my baby
Then it’s something wrong with me
If they ain't hating on what we got
I'ma need a new woman

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
If they ain't lookin', I don’t want her
I see, I can see 'em lookin', yeah
If they ain't lookin', I don’t want that girl
You know I don’t want her

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
If they ain't lookin', I don’t want her
If they ain't lookin', I don’t want her
If they ain't lookin', I don’t want that girl
No

[Outro: Problem]
