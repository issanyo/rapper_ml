[Intro]
[?]
Huh? Was it the rep?
Was it so our names could ring out on some fuckin’ ghetto street corners man
Naw man, there’s games man beyond the fucking game

[Verse 1: Bad Lucc]
When you niggas stop playin’ I stop playin’ the field
Like Cali niggas in Vegas I want more
I’ve exceeded my limit, limited livin’
I didn’t want much, couple of trips, she need a clutch capture
My extravagant mind thinkin’ of new ways to be better than most
And I’m rarely seen like a Blue Jay
Hall of fame shit, I been that, in my city I’m a wizard
Cali king, dance with the devil down in the blizzard, ah
I’m outchea runnin’ with scissors but fuck it
Greatness come with a price and I have become it
Feelin’ some type of way and so they stare, go to share
See all of this new age hype is like the [?]
Watch me, kinda cocky I deserve to be
Decade in the booth so let’s be clear this shit is surgery
Sweat rag in my pocket cause I’m known for goin’ in
I could do this in my sleep so if [?] you owe me ten

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Abstract asshole
Dazzle the competition everywhere I tip toe
Had rappers on they heels way before the deal, bro
Deal with it, get off my dill pickle for real
From a place where you was raised to keep a steel with you
Drop a splash of cognac to the pavement prayin’ they still with you
And they still miss you, just missed the terrorist threats
Just after they went through TSA with concealed missiles
In my carry-on luggage, you got a problem?
I’ll show you what bad luck is, I won’t even punch
No pun intended, my president’s black and will fuck you up
And no it ain’t taken a nap, but the gun is tucked
Is it just me or is it that your time is up?
And every minute counts, did you pass math or what?
Get to steppin’ before I pick you apart, spit on your heart
Laugh at your pain like I did Kevin’s

[Verse 3: Punch]
The combination of Donald Goines and Mickey Cohen
Literary gangsta to the core, try and spar with the boy
Steph and Illy, ain’t no cake walk
This a wake waitin’ to happen, you niggas love nappin’
My Top Dawg faction runnin’ the atlas
Runnin’ amuck, on niggas who passed and wasn’t proactive
Yea that’s the walk of shame crawlin’ back
[?] call ‘em back once we get a couple southern acts
Well, ain’t too much changed
Floor seat like a game, mile high private planes
And we did it our way, [?]
Light years ahead of niggas, this is Stargate
Yea, the floss is real, prove the million dollar deal
On the treadmill, I’m that trill
No more runnin’ in place, we’ll still run up in your place
And have you runnin’ your safe, or I’ll have Mack do it

[Verse 4: Problem]
Make way for the ratchet rapper, the matress thrashin’
Outlastin’ the last rapper you thought was better
Weed colour lighter than feathers, I’m heavy high
Was dealin’ D before Heavy died
Got ‘em screamin’ like a scary ride
But this ain’t magic mountain
Fuck, then bust, taste the magic fountain
Go against me, that’s a tragic album
I’m the winner bitch, you the ugly hoes at the pageant poutin’
They flock garbage, call out targets cocked and aim
Turn ‘em into past and fast forward, Lebron James
Yea we ballin’, feel like dunkin’ on a nigga
Pullin’ out with hoes, all in they face, Hollywood parkin’ on a nigga
See me shinin’ so there’s no need to discuss figures
Shit bumpin’, I’m poppin’, watch out for puss nigga
Weed burn in your face like mace, watch Puff nigga
And I turn my clubs all back on marks
