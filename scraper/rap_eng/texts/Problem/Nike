[Chorus:]
Throw a hundred nigga, get them back
Flew the whole nigga, get them back
Had to, had to do
I don’t wanna go
It’s a lot of money I just wanna get
Lot of money, I just got to get it
It’s a lot of hoes I ain’t fuck yet
I can’t wait to hit it
Had to wanna do [x2]
Had to, had to do [x2]
It’s a lot of money in the streets I ain’t got yet
Lot of bitches in the street I ain’t fuck yet
Had to wanna do
Had to, had to do
Had to wanna do
Had to, had to do
It’s a lot of money in the streets I ain’t got yet
Lot of bitches in the street I ain’t fuck yet
Had to wanna do

[Verse 1:]
Lot of money in the streets links
Am sailing in the street links
Hustling  in the street link
I can’t wait to get them off the block
I can’t wait to get a better condo woman
I’m better off without you, I’m the presidential man
Am such a man
I could dust a man now like a dems
Man died on the flask, on the high, you don’t know how he die
And am about to ride her, fuck the rhino
I’m about to take the crime
I can’t wait to get it
Have to, got to get it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Hate to hate to do
Get a pound and break it down
Got the grill going for ten
It's the strongest shit around
I just bought a whole bag
Right before I hit the yoke
Then I sold a half a bag
And the cutie took my photo
I run through this shit like a free bitch
On a project looking for some M pay
Then they come right back with their  4, 5
And I bail on that  nigga like MJ
Too dope, cool with a bad ass bitch
She really mine, you can have that bitch
Whole lot of money, I ain’t pay with cheque
No running after that, I ain’t studying that bitch
Scream, pull up
Anybody got a problem, nigga pull up
Walk to the club like, what?
Better not tell now, nigga would of
Look bitty bit we made it
Even though they say we couldn’t
Now everyday we living
Ain’t shit no niggas go approve it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I just had to do it
They say we couldn’t do it always
So I just had to prove it
I just had to prove it
The only way u gonna win nigga
Is if you ain’t afraid to loose it (hell no)
Hold on make me lose it
Shit, my weed got good acoustics
And my shoes be all exclusives
Boy D.O.G no let downs bro
Bullshits you must let that go
All that pride and all them rhymes
And when you come outside you won’t let that show
See a nigga like me I gots to
Cause I feel like I speak for every real nigga breathing
Hustle hard
Growing slow to ya’ll
Tragic boulevard
Any plus is better than the even
One
Oh god ya’ll niggas is believing
Hustle
Nigga out here spinning like a I’m teasing
Mark nigga don't give reason
Every season is hustling season

[Chorus]
