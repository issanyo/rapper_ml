(Repeats beat I'm rollin, rollin, rollin)

[Verse 1: Bad Lucc]
That pussy stolen stolen stolen stolen stolen and I did it
I be rollin rollin rollin that's the ID got me wit it
And I'm juiced, fatty on the loose
Ciroc got that Vodky but I'm better off that Goose
And hoes think I'm crazy cause I like my pussy public
She said she heard I ate the pussy in the club, fuck it
Burnt til I'm dead, left my morals at the house
I lay down on the floor, tell her oral in my mouth
It's Bad Lucc baby you know the deal I'm a beast
Before rapper a man, before that I was a freak
I'm turnt up silly I'm geekin I'm so thoed
Adi-das on I'm swiggin I'm so cold
3-5-4 and all my niggas on 10s
Pun steady laugh cuz I kissed that bitch again
Now I'm off that gin, I'm tryna get a twin
I be rollin, rollin, rollin, rollin, rollin bitch I'm in

[Verse 2: Problem]
Gone, hold up I be right back
Damn bitch why you lookin at me like that?
You know I'm high that's why she be bitchin
Eyes low hands feelin like they twitchin
Damn, that one ho over there bussin' it open
Naked, now that I wanna see her like I'm loccin'
Damn I just bumped into a hater
Blake Griffin grabbed the Clippers case a nigga gotta fade em'
Fade em', fuck it he ain't worth it
Molly, Molly, Molly got a nigga feelin perfect
Golly, Golly, Golly God damn this shit is workin
Next line ain't rhymin, I feel like eatin pussy
Okay, Lucc I need a drink
Take this bitch to the bathroom, fuck her on the sink
Now that bitch all up on my dick
Now I'm a make this bitch go and fuck the click, cuz we all
