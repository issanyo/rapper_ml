[Hook:]
Look like, walk like, smell like cash
You a freak I can tell that fast
Whatever it is I sell that fast
Ye know I'm all about that math
Whatever it is I do it big
Whatever it is I do it big

[Problem]
Twisted off the yak
‘Fro hanging out the hat like
All my bitches bad serving dick till they act right
Need a scratch like a cat fight
Flowing out blow burner keep my pack right
These guns and more chicken in the Sax Fifth
Ain’t trippin just threw forty in the mattress
Girl you playing like a bitch she's an actress
Turn your hood up, have her dryer than a cactus
P-Lo hit you with a banger
Grab nigga that got bitches like a singer
Just took a shoot and I got some more in the chamber
Your bitch in my car and let her cum on my finger
She can get nasty bitch I'm on
I ain't looking for a classy bitch
I need a hoe that’s worth to fuck some
Baby mama keep calling, she don’t want nothing, but
Deal with me later, I’m busy

[Bd-Lucc]
I do it big like a big nigga should
A big nigga skinny bitches like, uhh
I smell like a rat, a grand
To big bitches I'm a rat, a lamb
Turned up, in this cause bum up
Pimp like a purm up
BAD all is earned up
My niggas learn up
I keep her cumming like tactics
The bitch ain't never printed
Taught my sperm to do backflips

[IamSu]
I do it big, Jimmy Neutron head
I'm getting crouton bread
I hit it she get the bull like
Way ahead leg, that's the pun
Your baby daddy a little fruit that's a runt
I'm always on the cash man I'm always on the hunt
Ye I'm getting paper still fire up a blunt
Still riding through the hood like I ain't shit
The game can't quit
If I ain't on your song that thing ain't it

[Sage The Gemini]
Bitch give me cash for Christmas
That's merry dollar in it bitch
Wetter than whatever makes your fairy flow drail
Whole Tom Cruise, like Terry Jones
Thomas will bring the sex cause we carry all
Sell a bitch like car insurance
Your baby mama caught a nigga she want reinsurance
She want me into it cause I'm a get into it
I'm not the only one she let my nigga still influence

[Verse 5:]
Back up on it about to mack on it
And I keep game for cheap I keep my shack on it
This baby sure I spend a rack on it
Sweat it out in Vegas
Treat a hater like typos I get 'em edited out the paper
Razor, sharp flavor might give you a buck fifty
Put the pressure on and get 'em fried up crispy
Heartbreak game make the girls go stupid
Stay on the hussle I'm up early on the brewsky
