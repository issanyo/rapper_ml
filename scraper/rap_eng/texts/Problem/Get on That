(Hook)
I get on that bitch
And never bring her back

(Hook)
I get on that bitch
And never bring her back
You never win 'em back
I get on that bitch
And never bring her home
Never with a bitch
Leave it out alone
I get on that bitch

(Verse 1)
There ain't no bigger player than me
I be making moves every day of the week
Ballin' like a fool hoes thought I was geek
Till I got 'em into bed turning under with freaky
Want beats I need green
With it until 18, cash it with no steam
Never do two religions I came with the white scene
Give it that dough diggie, you notice it might fiend
Suzzy get the camera make a film with her
Watch yourself you're dealing with a real nigga
Ill nigga pop that pussy like a peel baby
Have a party on that tail call it

(Hook)
I get on that bitch
And never bring her back
You never win 'em back
I get on that bitch
And never bring her home
Never with a bitch
Leave it out alone
I get on that bitch

(Verse 2)
Then what's happening
Rolling no traffic
Pac won't pop till you go like magic
Can't tell Merik if you just like Dallas
Making getting green and we toss it like salad
Living like fellas, never been average
Bitch I'm fresh home check out these fabrics
I don't be all over like a college pick up
Save a dress to have sex with a condom nigga
Oh yeah, oh yeah is it cool if I go
Maybe I should slow up, strap it up and beat the hold up
Like this dick is about to go up
And this motherfucker get drunk

(Hook)
I get on that bitch
And never bring her back
You never win 'em back
I get on that bitch
And never bring her home
Never with a bitch
Leave it out alone
I get on that bitch
