[Verse 1: Austin Eldred]
Come my way, girl, I know you can't resist me
Don't be insane, girl, I know I'm fuckin' temptin'
All you wanna do is fuck around, get dizzy
All you wanna do is fuck around with me
Come my way, girl, I know that you have it
We can stay up late, baby, I'm gon' make it happen
All you wanna do is fuck around, get dizzy
All you wanna do is fuck around with me
And I know, I know, I know you tried
You can't stay away, know you can't fight it
I know, I know you tried to hide it
But you can't hide it, you can't even hide it

[Chorus: Austin Eldred]
Baby girl, you know me, I'm a savage
Baby girl, you know that I'm the baddest
Way I got you lookin' like you ain't matter
Ooh, ooh, I know you gotta have it
Baby girl, you know me, I'm a savage
Baby girl, you know that I'm the baddest
Way I got you lookin' like you ain't matter
Ooh, ooh, I know you gotta have it

[Verse 2: Problem]
Chachi on the mission, out here, two can fill the vision
So I don't have time to give you what you deserve
But soon as I get finished, grab some weed and grab some drink
I ring your line and be like, "I'm 'bout to come over"
And give you everythin' you need, give you everythin' you cravin'
Hit you with the ooh la la, I'm gon' land on you, ravin'
Almost feel as good as money, but you know that I don't do no savin'
No savin', I'm a savage

[Chorus: Austin Eldred]
Baby girl, you know me, I'm a savage
Baby girl, you know that I'm the baddest
Way I got you lookin' like you ain't matter
Ooh, ooh, I know you gotta have it
Baby girl, you know me, I'm a savage
Baby girl, you know that I'm the baddest
Way I got you lookin' like you ain't matter
Ooh, ooh, I know you gotta have it

[Bridge: Problem]
Come my way, yeah, I know you can't resist me
Only see each other when we high or we tipsy
I can see that Problem in your future like a gypsy
Right 'fore I go down, I ask that pussy do it miss me

[Chorus: Austin Eldred]
Baby girl, you know me, I'm a savage
Baby girl, you know that I'm the baddest
Way I got you lookin' like you ain't matter
Ooh, ooh, I know you gotta have it
Baby girl, you know me, I'm a savage
Baby girl, you know that I'm the baddest
Way I got you lookin' like you ain't matter
Ooh, ooh, I know you gotta have it
