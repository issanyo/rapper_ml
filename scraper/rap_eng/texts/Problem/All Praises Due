Real niggas don't die, real niggas don't die (x3)

Verse 1:
Eating Greek salads, very Steve Stoute-ish
Good nigga with a bad bitch that need counseling
Young Olive (?)
Epicurean resorts wildin' on a island
Getting back to the freshest leathers
En Noir trendsetters while you niggas jealous
Niggas winnin', dry gin'n, Sicily sinnin'
Haute livin', skinny women in Fendi linen
I booked my hood joint her first first class flight
I'm just living life shawty, just living life
I wish I was what I wish I was
Rich nigga drugs, I fuck her to no better love
I'm on my own in Balmain Homme
Love don't live here, don't call my phone
Jordan 3s on a 1960's Louis trunk
All I need is you needing me I donâ€™t wanna want
Alexander Wang black croc' playing cards
Life's only hard if you make it hard
I want it all but it's never enough
I'm on the phone with my lawyer and smoking a blunt

Verse 2:
I really be on it though I look out it
GPS on the road to riches, reroute it
Young real nigga, reasonable doubt it
Witty and wavy with whatever we wildin
Allahu akbar, sabotaging cop cars
For my niggas on the block that never got far
Dead prezie, glass jars, purple resie
Heads heavy, no love when it's necessary
Welcome to the real world, fake real life
Street rats versus field mice
And I wish I wasn't the fucking best
Best wishes to the next next fucking best
Jesus Christ even thought evil thoughts
I be offended to the point that I can't even talk
Lost world, but I found a spark
Heaven or hell, just hail royal art
Missoni motifs, all white gowns
All red hell behind my white smile
Praises due to the powers above
Never tell lies to the ones that you love
