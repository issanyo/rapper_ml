[Intro]
League of Stars
I don’t give a fuck about you, though…
Di-D-D-Di Di-Diamond Lane

[Verse 1]
My baby mamas say I wasn’t shit, and at first I used to believe ‘em
Now they on my dick, ’cause a young nigga out here eatin’
Every time I hop in my whip, I light one of my pre-rolls
At gettin’ gwap, I’m Gucci, without the ice cream cone
Sticking to that G-Code, I take a shot then reload
Only fuck with my street folk ’cause these rap niggas too emo
Forever on my grind, yeah, my five kids, they need clothes
Pump bucking at fake fucks ’cause like pimps they need hoes
Blaow! Bloaw! Oh my lord – my ho and my chain gold
Life be my bitch and that ho move when I say so
Good in my ‘hood, yeah, I play the block like Lego
Real goons on my payroll – I save money, you save hoes
Mountain high, I Range Rove, to the top on you niggas
If this was ’09 I would’ve been socking on niggas
Fuck that, rather profit on niggas – toe tag every beat Louis give me
Oh yeah I’m a problem, oh mama, no condoms
We’re yelling out “fuck all you pussies”

[Hook]
I don’t give a fuck about you, though…
I don’t give a fuck about you, though
We ain’t never struggle together
We ain’t made no money together…
I don’t give a fuck about you, though…
I don’t give a fuck about you, though…
So go that way, hoe…

[Verse 2]
They mad I made it, that’s why I be smiling so much
I’m killing these niggas, but damn it’s some bitches I’m dying to fuck
100 on records, these rappers is pussies, be lying too much
Approach and then pop ‘em, my boy, I ain’t really with iron too much
Try your luck – better be bad, bruh
You’ll lose that breath, no asthma
Keep a bitch coming like cash, huh?
Money ain’t funny, no laughter
It’s coming from my sides, nigga
It’s all winners ’round me…
In a room full of pussies, all I see is dinners ’round me
Well I eat ‘em up – YSL Centre, Adida’d up
You hug that bitch, you luh that bitch
I only call that ho when I need to fuck
Got another ‘cycle, I just filled it up
An another one I don’t event tough
My goonies on you, I’d better warn you boy
Quack! Quack! You might need to duck

[Outro]
I don’t give a fuck about you, though…
I don’t give a fuck about you, though
We ain’t never struggle together
We ain’t made no money together…
I don’t give a fuck about you, though…
I don’t give a fuck about you, though…
I don’t give a fuck about you, though…
I don’t give a fuck about you, though…
So go that way, hoe…
