Waste money 'fore I waste my time
Keep a bad bitch on my line
Real buzz, let me talk my shit
Quit playing, girl, hop on this dick
And akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup
Akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup

[Verse 1: LoveRance]
Big dog rolling on campus
Picture me rolling in the city, here's my canvas
Pull over bad bitches to my right side
Niggas they be tripping cause I’m fucking with their bitches, shit
Didn’t even rhyme, but it sound good
She said she wanted a Baller, I give her hard wood
West side, baby, yeah Nor Cal
Didn’t bring the bay back, I just knock the doors down
Wait, my nigga, what you tripping for?
Fuck these hoes, get the dough
Stack your money, make the shit flip
Don’t get caught up in your whip with an ugly bitch
Alright, train me like Eddy
Fuck this, I’m a pedi
Got them bitches crazy, call me Tom Petty
Grab her hips, tell her keep that ass steady
What that mouth do? Show me, girl, don’t tell me

Waste money 'fore I waste my time
Keep a bad bitch on my line
Real buzz, let me talk my shit
Quit playing, girl, hop on this dick
And akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup
Akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Tell a broke nigga back up
I’m cashed up, tatted up, nigga, and I'm strapped up
Two-seater, bitches gotta lap up
Arm out the window, Audemar, throw my hat up, akup
Fucka, wonder why them bitches don’t trust us
Pussy coming in, I'mma need more rubbers
Your bitch love us, she lick dick under covers
Take cover, leave nut on the tongue
I like them bitches in the valley
Working at that Bally's, porn star Valery
Nice to meet ya, she like the D
I like to be, we fuck like once a week
Once she get the akup, bitch, pack up
Turn around, count the money, watch the shit add up
Turn around, get another bitch that’s badder
Ass fatter, then I fuck her faster, nigga

[Verse 3]
Bad bitches on my line, call it call waiting
Niggas waiting on the sideline, they be hating
Four bitches in my whip, I’m a ?limo dating?
All black car, reminds me of a nigga? Skady?
And I run my set like a relay
When a nigga play my song, send a bottle to the DJ
I'd rather kill her, I rather fuck your bitch, nigga
You at home, I’m on the road, getting rich nigga
Enough of that shit, let me get back to the women
‘cause it’s thick in this bitch, I’m liking what I see
Give me more bottles, I’m trying to get drunk
Wake up tomorrow, roll to my right, ask who the fuck is you?
Please don’t tell me what we do
Pound you, round two, high class bitch
But best believe I’ll ground you
Walk of shame, baby, let my homies clown you
Bitch!

Akup, akup, akup, akup, akup, akup
