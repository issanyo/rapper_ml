[Hook]
I took a little vacation
Had to put it all in perspective
And now I’m back, motherfucker
Relapse, motherfucker
I took a little vacation
Had to put it all in perspective
And now I’m back, motherfucker
Relapse motherfucker

[Verse 1]
I wish these niggas would get off my dick (dick)
Shit your ho already there
Packed a lil bag gettin' high with the guy lookin' to the sky
Baby I’m already there let’s go
I'm cloud stepin' cause I popped one
These mark niggas I am not them
Turn your day black as Gotham
I'm high as fuck about to sock some
Miami on a yacht huddlin' I made mine
I don't fly cousin, do my thing til the cops comin'
My YSL's keep the block bobling
My [?] keep the block rumblin'
[?] stuntin' but I’m not stumbling
Who she kissing? You let me in in that Gucci lips
From day 1 I talk like this cause I’m day one, block boy
Me coming back to my hood is something no nigga can’t stop boy
You the youngs fuck [?]
And used to be from that
Now you was claimin' this
Oh, God I got pictures off niggas
Why am I trippin’ my nigga


[Hook]


[Verse 2]
Just one nigga fuck my bitch
It is what it is
[?] Fuck that move on
Niggas like "How you let a little man come and just take your position?"
With fake ass beats [?] niggas 20 deep
Tried to defuse it, keep it all amusing
Fuck it we can blame it on the streets I suppose
A real nigga rule number 3-54 never ever ever ever beef over hoes
[?]
Plus my toilet paper is long enough to have that ass bleed
Like when your ass wipe too hard [?]
In the squad I trust
And my momma probably gonna be mad at me
But I’m back on the dust
And I brought some more dope for the city
My drug’s good, my plug good
Get a [?] for the 50


[Hook]

[Outro]
Where the [?] at? He the man with the [?]
All rush no cut, he the man with the fire
Go time, show time I'm the man on the [?]
Can’t respect no nigga if he can't look in my eyes
When I’m talking to him
Y'all was rappin' about it I was walkin' through it
Gangsta shit boy I can talkin' fluid
After win [?] I often lose it
Don’t be mad just boss up
My passport got stamps
And my most loyal is [?]
Gave your boy the clap
