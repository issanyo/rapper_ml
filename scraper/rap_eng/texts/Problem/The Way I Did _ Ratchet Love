[Chorus: Problem]
Whoever thought I'd boss up like the way I did?
Whoever thought I'd fall off like the way I did?
Whoever thought I'd bounce back like the way I did?
Did-did-did, what?
Whoever thought I'd boss up like the way I did?
Whoever thought I'd fall off like the way I did?
Whoever thought I'd bounce back like the way I did?
What?

[Verse 1: Problem]
Losin' ain't me, nigga
Ain't never gon' be me, nigga, don't try that
I done paid attention, paid every due
The game I done gained, bitch niggas can't buy that (Why?)
Been back stabbed, nigga, I been lied at
I got war wounds, nigga, I been played (Been played)
Yeah, I got me some bread and I changed
But if niggas ran up, niggas know who gon' stay
Young chach, high with my stupid ass
How many drugs wanna try with my stupid ass?
How many chains I'ma buy with my stupid ass?
Fuck it, flex 'til I die with my stupid ass (Fire)

[Chorus: Problem]
Whoever thought I'd boss up like the way I did?
Whoever thought I'd fall off like the way I did?
Whoever thought I'd bounce back like the way I did?
Did-did-did, what?
Whoever thought I'd boss up like the way I did?
Whoever thought I'd fall off like the way I did?
Whoever thought I'd bounce back like the way I did?

[Verse 2: Problem]
Shootin', basketball
My pen niggas gettin' torn watchin' niggas from the basket ball
Free my nigga Ron
Free my nigga Miller
Free my nigga Duck
Free my nigga Green Eyes
Salute to my LA gang ties
Pushin' these drugs, I done seen it change lives
Pushin' these drugs is the reason why I shine
So I stay up in that new shit, can't relive

[Chorus: Problem]
Whoever thought I'd boss up like the way I did?
Whoever thought I'd fall off like the way I did?
Whoever thought I'd bounce back like the way I did?
Did-did-did, what?
Whoever thought I'd boss up like the way I did?
Whoever thought I'd fall off like the way I did?
Whoever thought I'd bounce back like the way I did?
What?

[Interlude: Problem]
Man, this shit crazy
You just never know man
You just gotta stay on these niggas, huh
Ain't gon' let nothin', none of that
Sometimes you gotta get into war with your niggas
Sometimes you gotta, feel me, just get out here, and
Just get to what you know, you feel me?
My nigga Dave say, you know you kicked off that bop, you feel me?
Niggas need some love
What?

[Verse 3: Problem]
Motherfuckin' ratchet love, nigga
Sayin' they love you and hate you in the same text
It's that I don't want you to fuck nobody else
Even though you gon' fuck somebody else
Who just hit a nigga line for some money though?
But a nigga ain't gon' lie, kinda love it though
But I could never, young man, am I a thug or not?
Put that pussy off Mollys that's what you say
In fact, I got a little time, we could leave today
L-O-L, I back line when I get freaky
Matter fact, you know I'm lyin', I ain't callin' you
And I probably ain't gon' call, I'm just fallin' through
And I damn near beat it, I'm trippin'
I know these rules don't make sense, bitch, I'm different
But I can do it like this 'cause I'm gettin' it

[Chorus: Problem]
Yeah, it's that ratchet love
She fucked you with another bitch so off of you
She ain't really with that shit though
You ain't but you is like my bitch though
Yeah, it's that ratchet love
It's that motherfuckin' ratchet love
Huh, what
It's that ratchet love
It's that motherfuckin' ratchet love

[Verse 4: Problem]
It's that ten toes down, you gon' stay
No matter what a motherfucker do, no matter what you fuckin' say
Yeah, I know your home girls hate me
Fuck them bitches
What's it matter? They ain't gettin' dicked down
Yeah, hop on this thing when that shit round
Shit, I can barely stand, let me sit down
Got your hands in my pants, let me hit now

[Chorus: Problem]
Uh, it's that ratchet love
It's that motherfuckin' ratchet love
Ooh, yeah, shit
It's that ratchet love
It's that motherfuckin' ratchet love

[Verse 5: Problem]
It's that hate you and tell you I love you in the same text
It's that I got other hoes but you my favorite
Like, I would settle down but I can't sit
Think I really ain't gon' lie, I ain't shit
Yeah, she love my stupid ass
Put it with your shit 'cause you know you got stupid ass
And you put up with my shit 'cause I got stupid cash
And you put up with my shit 'cause I got stupid cash
Double up, real nigga, ain't gon' fuck it up
Girl, you got your nigga hard, come and suck it up
You niggas don't do it like I do 'cause y'all ain't tough enough
Y'all ain't moved enough weight, y'all ain't buff enough

[Chorus: Problem]
Yeah, it's that ratchet love
It's that motherfuckin' ratchet love
Yeah, ooh, yeah
It's that ratchet love
It's that motherfuckin' ratchet love
It's that motherfuckin' tell you that I love and I hate you in the same text, yeah

[Interlude: Problem]
Girl, I ain't gon' even do-I'm not even gon' lie to her
It's like, fuck it, I'm just gonna let that shit - it's just not-the shit
I think it's not what I'm talkin' 'bout, shit

Yeah, sneaky baby

[Verse 6: Nick Grant]
Uh, tell a hoe to love or just leave me alone
Watchin' for the devils that be leadin' me on
Yeah, it's all about the clique like I hung up the phone
Drop-top, slick back like Steven Seagal
What it is hoe? How ya feel?
They gon' do you dirty out the flower pot, for real
Chopper out the window, niggas hoppin' out for thrills
Give you the run around like you ain't got a deal
Not a shooter though
I just knew him though
I need a movie role
When your money ain't funny, bitches don't boo your jokes
Kingpin of the pen, look how I move the dope
When life looks fishy, I eat a tuna roll
Nasty
How they gon' judge you when they don't know you?
All the leeches just won't allow you to be a mogul
Master teacher, the slave song tryna control you
But, shit, when you the go-to guy, who do you go to?
