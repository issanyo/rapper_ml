[Verse 1: The Game & (Problem)]
Problem struck a match and the match went out
Carpool full of hoes (Diamond Lane in the house)
You know I be lovin' them, fuckin them, fuck all the kissin' and huggin'
I'm thugging nigga, it's The Game in the house
Baby girl where the dominos? Set up the table for the homie
Here go 100, we hungry, so order Domino's (fuck yeah!)
Sit on my lap, let me, rub on your back
{Do what you want with it} Don't you tell a nigga that
She trying keep the score, her girlfriend sleep on the floor
Off Ciroc and the PARTYNEXTDOOR (bitch here)
We good is it for 'em to come
If the homies can't {Get-get-get-get-get, get some?}

[Hook: The Game]
Girl you need a thug in your life, thug in your life
Girl you need a thug in your life, thug in your life
Girl you need a thug in your life, thug in your life
Girl you need a thug in your life, you need a thug in your life

[Verse 2: Problem & (The Game)]
18 to auntie's, chochies in them panties
Hood fly nigga with bread in all me pantries
Take her to the crib and get her Netflix on
Till she get me neck licks with my necklace on
Fuckin' bling on you baby, you bad girl
Them leggin' pants complementin your ass girl
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
And on that note, my nigga Game where you at
I heard you got it back, 'sup with that?
(In a bathroom nigga, bout' to break a bitch back)
Ooh-wee, I wish I was you
I'm bout' go to find our crew
What! Turn up! Gone! (Oh shit!)

[Hook: The Game]
Girl you need a thug in your life, thug in your life
Girl you need a thug in your life, thug in your life
Girl you need a thug in your life, thug in your life
Girl you need a thug in your life, you need a thug in your life
