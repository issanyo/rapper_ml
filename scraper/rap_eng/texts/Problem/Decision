[Hook : Problem]
I know I need to put this condom on, on
Cause I ain't fucked you in no hole so long, long

Gotta make a decision, I gotta make a decision

Could may be switch up on me and start to hold that
We know each other soul I ain't gotta hold back
Shit if you still on the pill I gotta tell you the real
You still lettin' nigga [?] it, just like Problem
Don't lie when I was fuckin' if you didn't like condoms
So what the fuck changed? You ain't gotta look strange boo

[Verse 2 : Problem]
This is the main but I don't wanna choose it
Got one in my pocket but I don't wanna use it
Do some quick, real quick before I loose it
Before I flashback to when we were exclusive
And just stick it in and do what I do to it
Music on your phone turn it on I'm mood to it
Give me that bomb, no time I cruze through it
Uh I'll [?] some after that
Like I stick it in, take 3 pumps see what it's bout
Take 3 [?] to pull it out
You [?] me with the rubber like I need to do

Fucked the shit about a bitch [?]
