Nigga motivated, motivated
Ooh yes, I came to win
I said I came to win
Nigga motivated, motivated
Good Lord, I came to win
I came to win, oooh why

Understand it, my squad, realest niggas on the planet
On God, made a million of a ad-lib (WHAT)
Ain't running from no fucking challenge
Fly everywhere I go, no pilot, no stylist
It's first class Chach, better check the mileage
No paint on my face, but I pull up clowning
Like "whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop"
You niggas tryin' to eat, I'm the cookbook
All you need is good brain and a backbone
No main line, hit me on the back phone
We on, then we off, then we back on
Buy something, stash the rest, get my stack on
Any deal that I'm in, I get my tax on
For anybody that's ass gone [?]

[Hook]

Sister need a house, father need a house
Brother need a house, mama need a house
Fuck it, gimme the ball, I'll scramble
God ain't gave me nothing that I can't handle
Lemme show you how to get it
Life be a bitch, I'ma show you how to hit it
Nigga never pose, but I'm good with the pivot
Game ready, y'all niggas only good in the scrimmage
Turn it up! Nigga turn it up
Celebrating every win, young nigga where the cup?
With the business (with the business bro), yeah I'm with the business
No suit, no tie, no Congress, no Senate
I swear all pussies I'll kill when I'm in it
No limit, go hard to the finish
Lil' mama I'm motivated!

[Hook]

You came to win, yeah, oh
Ay, if you came to win yell ooooh
Gotta let them know that you are motivated
Let them know that you are motivated

[Hook]
