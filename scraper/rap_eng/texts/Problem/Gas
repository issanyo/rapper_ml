[Verse 1: Problem]
I'm on like a phone, name ring
Boy talking tough light it up Beijing
Everything bling, cock bang, hot as a lead shot
Mami with the frame, Cobain with the head shot
And I ain’t talking pictures, godly with my scriptures
Life be a bitch, poppin’ molly till I flip em
We we bitch I’m on TV bitch, ain’t pussy, ain’t bitch
You won’t see me switch, naw!!
Walk it like I talk it, pick my target then I chalk it
And hand made garments high as Hollywood apartments
Giving white bitches charges yeah I got that plug
And my goon nigga pig, yeah he got that snub
Somebody’s in troub, oh mama, one triple O
Feeling like a G no comma I’m finna go
Bonkers on any aside a bitch hit the floor
Riding like a whip with low mileage, who need some more?

[Hook: Problem]
Gas, gas, gas
Gas, gas, gas, gas
Gas
Who need some more?
Gas
Who need some more?
Gas
Who need some more?
Gas?

[Verse 2: Iamsu!]
And everywhere I go, I am more fly
And I don’t ride with pigs like security in bow ties
My city is a no fly zone, bullshit don’t fly
My last breath is how I.. approach mine
I don’t need a co sign, I don’t need a hand out
Let my nuts hang everyday I go commando
Handle my biz, like a wore suit
And I got work, I done had a horror too, horrible
And I gas like the damn chorus
Nigga born the truth, sting your ass like the hornet do
Try to warn the dudes, coke flow, got a bottom line, you can snort a few
Cop Jordans by the pair, actually I ordered two
Been winning but it’s more to do, and I know that
Me and problem go back, like throw backs, I throw racks
At broke cats, call it catnip, and I’m that dip
Everyday I’m always where the cash is

[Hook: Problem]
Gas, gas, gas
Gas, gas, gas, gas
Gas
Who need some more?
Gas
Who need some more?
Gas
Who need some more?
Gas?

[Verse 3: Los]
Bad boy!
Yo!, Ayo!
I just copped the drop, disgusting new rims
Bitch I get scratch like I’m scuffing new Timbs,
I could tell that bitch bye like I’m fucking two friends
Then I tell that bitch bye like I’m fucking two fems
Uhh gas honey for the head
Like fuck the tooth fairy bitch I’m money in the bed
Think my niggas loading up them 40 calibers to play?
My niggas throwing up flags like they challenging a play
Talk shit to the sun on a Sunday
Then put the heat to you like the sun do a sundae
See what happen to your bitch when you half train her
She get smashed cause my swag on gas chamber
If I thought that she felt love I neglect her
I turn a bad bitch to a belt buckle inspector
I like tricks, Like hoes, like sluts
If they ain't tryna fuck, that’s a problem like..
[Problem] whaaat!!!!

Gas, gas, gas
Gas, gas, gas, gas
Who need some more?
Who need some more?
Gas, gas, gas, gas
