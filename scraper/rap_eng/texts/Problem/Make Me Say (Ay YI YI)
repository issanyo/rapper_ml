[Hook : Problem]
I don't know why but these bad bitches make me say
Ay Yi Yi Ay Yi Yi Ay Yi Yi Ay Yi Yi
I don't know why makin' this money makes me say
Ay Yi Yi Ay Yi Yi Ay Yi Yi Ay Yi Yi
I don't know why ridin' with my niggas make niggas hate

[Verse : Problem]
Let's celebrate follow my gram, lemme navigate
Feels good to have my jams rockin', shoo
Without neva degradin' this Compton shit
This Diamond Lane shit, I ain't nun' without the squad
Get religious for a second, I ain't nothin' without my God
Where the sky point-up, if you joint, roll a joint up
Or a blunt or backwood whatever you do

No niggas gon' hate you fo' whateva you do
And that's cool with me
I put that on the game, it's on my jewelry
