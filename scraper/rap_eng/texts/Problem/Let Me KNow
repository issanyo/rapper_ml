[Hook 1]
I've been drinking Hennessey all day
Ounces I just smoke like two (like two)
I just feel ya da dat tat tat
Only thing on my mind is you
Tonight I ain’t going nowhere
All my freaked out I'm tryna share with you
Hey hey

[Hook 2]
Damn that nine o’clock, I'm home alone
Texting you wishing you’d come over to my place
After a while
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know

[Verse 2]
Baby I've been drinking baby I've been smoking
And I'm kinda hoping you’d change your plans
And come to your man fuck your home girl tonight
Cause I'm tryna suck you all well tonight
Yeah, let that cha cha in a [?]
You looking so good when I saw you on that snap
Screenshotted that like I want that on my lap right now
So I'm like fuck it fuck that soft shit I wanna fuck it
Thought I was a coach the way I changed her positions

Cha cha on these niggas have a muslim yelling God
So them plans you had you better cut em like a line
Put my love inside you exploding like a bomb
(Boom) game over get yo ass here so I can show ya

Damn that nine o’clock, I'm home alone
Texting you wishing you’d come over to my place
After a while

But you got me so anxious
Boy the way you talk just call me
Then I grab a sip and tell it

Molly in my drink so we going back up
Know I'm a problem so I'm yelling what
Yeah I'm yelling what, what you gonna do
Sniff that shit you know I'm tryna score
Ain’t got no other hoes man it’s all about you
Ain’t calling you a hoe I just that
Cause imy lick yo body from yo head to your heal
Eyebrows on fleek but I can see you need to feel
Imy handle that soon as you wake up
Use a heart manicure to come back to life yo what
