What's up tryna fuck me?
Yeah, I'm tryna fuck you
What's up tryna lick me?
Hell yeah, I'm tryna lick you

Fuck it, take ya tights off
Fuck it, take ya tights off
Fuck it, take ya tights off

Watch you do drop to my knees and just do you
Like you need to be done
Make that burst
I ain't tripping, I ain't tripping
Girl, I'll go first
Go real slow, go little slower, go little slower
You can tell I'm older
Shit,My shit a little different from these young ass niggas
So easy to take bitches from these dumb ass niggas, yeah
I ain't into no begging
Got you giving head while you pulling off ya leggings
Girl let me ask you

[Hook]
What's up tryna fuck me?
Yeah, I'm tryna fuck you
What's up tryna lick me?
Hell yeah, I'm tryna lick you

Fuck it, take ya tights off
Fuck it, take ya tights off
Fuck it, take ya tights off

Ain't no need to have the lights on, yeah
Grab on your waist, tongue on your clit
Looking dead in ya face
And don't get mad when I pull on your long weave
Cause you know I got the bread to send you to Pualine's
In the morning, for the Indian
Tell your man you ain;t coming back like Vivian
Pussy's my house, hell yeah I'm gonna be living in it
Heard my dick bomb
World travel like it ain't dripping

Nipple nibblin, cheek gripping, dick shifting, ass licking
Like whaaaaa?
To show ?? tip swollen, mouth golden its for show you gone nut

[Hook]

Less a nigga just pop that thang
Its bout to go down
Look at me, you wanna judge me
Go and throw the book at me
Cause its aboout to be a motherfucking murder out here
You would think a nigga winning
Its smelling burn in here, the way I..
Yeah let you off, bend you over
Then give it, give it till you sore
Singing, you about to go to hell now
Watch me get it back up like it fell down
