Okay

[Verse 1]
Nigga I'm pushing through my old hood but I'm in my new whip
Nigga with an attitude, on my Ice Cube shit
Pissing mark niggas off, haters always looking at me
Mad cause they ain't me, all they bitches threw some pussy at me
My chick bad, looking like a bag of mollies
My clique bad too, looking like a pack of Halle's
Berry, never scary, they do everything I want em to
Lick em down in liquid then I drop and do my woman too
Yeah my life is beautiful, Compton California flow
Got that ghetto revenue, that Compton California dough
Been around the world but it's comped in California though
The nigga tell them niggas get that Compton California low
Pricey, yeah, I can't get no ice it like in my mental state
Circle too small for you square niggas to infiltrate
They meant to fake, haha, nah me, not us dude
Real game, not giving a fuck doe

[Hook]
I'm bout the dough
Everything else is secondary, secondary
Man fuck them hoes, money first
Everything else secondary, yeah secondary
I said whoa whoa whoa
Say say whoa whoa whoa
If your money over hoes
Gettin money over hoes, everything else secondary

[Verse 2]
Name is Problem AKA Chochy, the man of the hour
They say the man with the money is the man with the power
Well goddamn, I know who I am then
Bitch niggas sit down before I stand in
Y'all know who run it, don't need no tennis shoes
I'm still BET and I have yet to lose
I ain't got no rules, I'm the Problem
I'm so with it, that's on my mama
Too many hoes on my face, rolling, got a gun on waist
Wear my jewels all over the place
Yeah I'm a star all over the space
Waiter, I need all of the cases
Yelling fuck y'all niggas like a racist, what?
