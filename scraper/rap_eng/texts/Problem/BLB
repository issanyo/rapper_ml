[Verse 1: Problem]
It's just different when you fuckin' with a West side nigga
Everything I do is salt with the extras, nigga
Homie never ever let me be a bitch made nigga
Fifth grade, hittin' niggas with the switchblade, nigga
Nigga, I'm an open book, dawg, you's a switch-page nigga
Seen it all, done it all, seen the shit change niggas
Don't talk to outsiders 'less I get paid with 'em

[Chorus: Problem]
Got a big black gauge for you big brave niggas
Got a big black dick for a bad little bitch
Got a bad little bitch for my bad little bitch
Got a bad little bitch for my bad little bitch
Had a bad little bitch for my bad little bitch
Got a big black dick for my bad little bitch
Got a bad little bitch for my bad little bitch
Had a bad little bitch for my bad little bitch
Had a bad little bitch for my bad little bitch
What

[Verse 2: Problem]
Bend you over, hit you with the- (Hey)
'Specially if I'm off the liquor, I'ma get you right
Baby, call that girl you call your sister (Ayy)
And tell her pull up if she want to try to change her life
Fight now, ooh, hit her with the-yeah yeah yeah (Hey)
Freaky on the pull up, barely make it out the ca-yi yi  (Hey)
Boom-boom-boom, let me introduce you to this lifestyle (Hey)
Magnum wearer, bitch, I can't fit no Lifestyle (Hey)
Lick you out them PJs, yeah, we takin' flight now
You blowin' like the wind, you would think I brought a kite 'round
Send no anchors, far from neighbors, bitch, you ain't gotta pipe down
Yell it out, let these bitches know this dick is bomb (Bomb!)
You knew you was gon' give it up tonight like this is prom (Prom!)
Don't ask me 'bout no other hoes 'cause, bitch, this ain't the time (Time!)
She gon' lick you from the front, I'ma hit it from behind
What

[Chorus: Problem]
Got a big black dick for a bad little bitch
Got a bad little bitch for my bad little bitch
Got a bad little bitch for my bad little bitch
Had a bad little bitch for my bad little bitch
Got a big black dick for my bad little bitch
Got a bad little bitch for my bad little bitch
Had a bad little bitch for my bad little bitch
Had a bad little bitch for my bad little bitch
Got a big black dick for my bad little bitch
Got a-

[Verse 3: French Montana]
We ain't have a choice, had to go get it (Hey)
Now a nigga on wit' it
Millions on tall wit' it
Two-two chains on if the feds watchin'
Shorty with a head bop, game in a headlock
And-and when you see me, I be on
Pop-pop a pill, then take a swing and then I'm gone
Gotta get that money, nigga, hustlin' 'til I'm on
Kept it a hunnid, took it over from the home
Add the front when we started from the backdoor
Smoke a O, pop a X, tic-tac-toe
Five broke friends had to break a knot
Gon' pop two of these, watch it take flight

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey
Hey
