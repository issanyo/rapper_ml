[Intro: Kent Jamz]
I wish I could fuck, smoke weed, and sleep all day
But I got to get this money
Baby got to get this money
I know you want to spend my money
Mmm hmmm… mmm hmmm…
Then you want to spend my money…
Got a real one…
Look…

[Verse 1: Kent Jamz]
Got a bad Asian and black chick, stays in Calabasas
Got a real rich dad that [?], bitch you broke my mattress
She said, "These niggas bump okay shit, and that ain't alright with me
I listen to Ye and Drake, but y'all bring life to me"
Lay your back up on my mattress, baby tell me my shit active
Tell these wack niggas quit rapping, that's your bitch, that's your friends laughing
She took me to a party, where I ain't know nobody
Her and her friends all gone off mollies, touching all over my body, singing

[Hook: Kent Jamz/Brittany Dorn]
I wish I can fuck, smoke weed, and sleep all day
But I got to get this money
But I got to get this money
Baby let me get this money (x3)

[Verse 2: Problem]
How you think I've been the nigga since the 1st grade
C-c-cutting school, fuck a first-aid
Got a thou-wow in my pocket, on my worst day (on my worst day)
Now give you haters like happy birthday
So bitch, blow this candle out
And when you does, show a nigga what the camel 'bout
Strawberry color whip, with the peanut butter gut
Hoes come in two's like peanut butter cups, what!
I don't give a fuck, nigga this Compton, bitch
So get your ass on this Compton dick
Molly popped, Molly popped, every fucking pussy getting molly-wopped
Paper first, bullshit last
Paper first, maker her mad
Make 'em curse, make it cum
Work this pole, I bet it'll cum
Booyow!
Let me smoke my tree and keep it G forever (G forever)
I'm now on them chocolate hoes, cause I fucked all the ones that's yeller (the ones that's yeller)
I'm still bout my cheddy, I blow all my multi, and them I am adiós
She want to lick me, and I'm going to let her, no envelope, (Problem)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joon]
What it do bitch number one, lady number two, slut number three (welcome to the Dest my dear)
We going to do a whole lot of you, whole lot of kush, whole lot of drugs (a lot of whine and beer)
But by the time the click is six past six got to dip (up out of here)
Thank you for all the fun, sorry I have to hit and run
She got them promethazine tittes, thirty-two (double cup D)
I was planning to give it to her nice and slow (that double cup D)
But I hit the mystical danger, she said she don't do anal
But since a nigga almost famous, it's okay if I use my fingers

[Hook]

[Verse 4: P]
Every God-given day, that bomb puts me in a phase
Paranoia got me praying on my knees (shit)
Now you calling me insane, niggas trying to throw me shade
But one thing I won't taste is defeat
It's that simplistic pimp shit
My style sick, just like a plague
Homebody, that's why my homies call me "P"
All I do is just be cool, that's why these trick niggas hating
While they hating, got they bitches singing praise to a G
Niggas need to find peace
My mind, sending tingles down the spine
Get in touch, with a body, hit them spots that you can't find
I just hit her one time, lift my feet as I recline
Then I pass her to my dog, point guard Kobe Bryant

[Hook]
