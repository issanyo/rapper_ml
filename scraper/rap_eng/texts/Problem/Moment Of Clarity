(Intro)
That Nigga sayin what?!
Ha ha
Yeah right

(Verse)
Let’s make a few things clear
When you’re gone I’ll still be here
Won’t miss a day, this ain’t leap year
We knock out teeth here
Shoppin have a new freak every week here
That smell good with pretty feet here
Had to risen from the ashes, predicted by the masses
To be one of the few that persevere through the ratchet era
80’s baby, the classic era
Got the skill to bounce back, I’m elastic terror
Turn that, surrounded by smoke
Grew Niggas with no bread, care from some toast?
Crazy right?
Went from a rapper to a trapper then back to a rapper
My definition of a crazy life I guess
God’s with me, so it’s like who I got to impress?
Heartless, the life Bitch put a knife in my chest
And so what? Is it kinda prove real life to my chest
Pulled it out, stuck her and I’m lookin' to slice the rest of you Motherfuckers
Wait a minute, I’m a ladies man
Not that Nigga frontin' hood with the crazy vans on
Out here gangbangin with them lil pants on
Old Nigga , forever young, get my Peter Pan on
Huh, we don’t need no nigga's validation
I speak for the diamond nation every time I talk
We did what? Don’t believe them allegations
Be a slave and tell by the way you walk, talk and think
By the smell of this dank
Spend my time in they bitches, the other half in the bank
My grind has no limits, I’m Master P in a tank
With super psychin, C Murda tuck in the shank
And niggas takin shots just like they bustin with blanks
I hear but don’t feel em
I’ll punch em, but won’t kill em
It ain’t my MO
But I got niggas for that
Don’t need no more rappers on my dick, I got bitches for that
I think they should start spellin The Nigga
P-R-O-B-L-E-M
Bird, let’s petition for that
Get the dictionary ready
Keep my girl, the energy is more than the two trips of Mary Mary
Very scary, the coupe is very dary
Milky white, lounging at the polo lounge, deeper than Barry White
Voice buried 24 feet in the ground
It’s real in the field, got my clicks on em now

(Outro)
They like P what you doin? Wanna switchin yo style right now? You winnin
Yea, but as yo mind change, yo grind change with it
Would be the same old nigga if I did it
