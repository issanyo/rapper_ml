[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
You throwin' it back, back, back, back on me
And I'm throwin' stacks, stacks, stacks, stacks on it
Look at all this bread you got
Is you out of debt or nah?
I'm sure this'll help, you by yourself is all that I want
I know you could tell but it's only 12
And it's killin' me 'cause I know your shift don't end 'fore another 3
And my eyes can't stop watchin' you stare at me
You know when I throw it up
I want you to throw it down
Go slow when you pick it up
And real low when you drop it down

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
I got that money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, babe
Come take it from me, from me, from me, from me, from me, from me, from me, from me, babe
I got that money, come and take it from me
Girl, I know you want it, you can come catch a few stacks with a body like that
And that ain't even bein' a lie
I want what's in between you thighs
I heard you like it super size, and girl
All I really need is 3 minutes, 3 minutes
I swear all I really need is 3 minutes, 3 minutes
Things I'd do to you if we had privacy

[Verse 2: Problem]
180 seconds
Within the first 20, bet Young Chachi have you naked
Few niggas licked on that clique but I'm 'bout to disrespect it, whaaat la-la-la-la-la
Your boyfriend textin' you, it's soundin' like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Fuck him, girl, you is whipped
Ass on photo but I ain't givin' a shit
Product from nothin', I made it to rich
But they can't stay rich, can't be trustin' these bitches, oh no
Plus somethin' seem different about you
Pussy get can't leave that alone, no
Depends will I get him up off you?
The molly go deep as the Ozone

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
Can you imagine if we had the club to ourselves?
I'll be tippin' all night long
I'll provide the pole for sure
And we would need more then a single song, a song

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
3 minutes
You could do a lot in 3 minutes
I swear all I really need is 3 minutes, 3 minutes
You gotta go hard, must I remind you
I got money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, babe
Come take it from me, from me, from me, from me, from me, from me, from me, from me, babe
I got that money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, babe
I got it all, the things I'd do to you if we had privacy
