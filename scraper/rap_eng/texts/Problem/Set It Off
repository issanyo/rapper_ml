Pussy nigga try me if you wanna
We open fire on yo corner
What beef? You know you don't want it
But I'm gone with all that baloney
Boy you flawed and you phoney
I'm as real as it gets
Your homie soft and a pussy
I'd rather chill with his bitch
Set it off in this bitch, set it off in this bitch
Double-breasted Smith and Wesson
Set it off in this bitch, set it off in this bitch
Set it off in this bitch
Double-breasted Smith and Wesson
Set it off in this bitch


[Bad Lucc]
Shout out to them niggas
When I frontline with them yoppers
A O P my nigga, play me one on one I call it knockas
Money by the bag and fuck your drug I'm gettin' mad dough
Daddy never sleeping when I'm creeping it's extendo
Hanging on the roof I yell my city then I flex up
Me and Problem gonna check up
We need everything from the neck up
My dealer stony he's next up
Get a nigga holding that tec up
Beef with me, that shit messed up
Put 50 shots where you rest up
Count up nigga go ape shit
30 inch on that space ship
Big boy don't say shit got Little niggas don't play shit
Hundred K on yo people make you niggas look see through
Bad Lucc is the preview tear shit down what we do

[Problem]
While I took on the city
Niggas wanna know how I did it
Married to the grind, you only shine if you commited
Overlook your kind I don't got time for nothing, kitty
I got soldiers like lietenants that knock logos of a fiddy
Be that guy, go ahead, be that guy, fire in that eye, so has a fly
Bloaw x5
Say hello to Allah
Fuck this marks, motherfuck these marks
I decide your faith
Young nigga acting like a G
Old dog lil' rich hate
That ain't real nigga
That ain't real nigga
In your squad, it ain't one real nigga, ain't one real nigga
On my mum
Because if it was the would have told your ass about fucking with me though
Dont ever mention Mike with Teedough
Get up on my level boy
