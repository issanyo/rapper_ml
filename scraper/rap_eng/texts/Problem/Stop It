[Verse 1: Problem]
I dig hoes, I’m a grave digger
So I got hoes like NBA niggas
Let’s have a dunk [?] uncle times
Got ‘em all from my uncle’s line
Learnt me somethin’ in my uncle’s pond
Everything was, seen heroin swoon into a guy’s veins
His body moves then his brain turns to Charlemagne
It’s a wild thing, life's just a wild game
Ball or die with [?], Crips turn to Bloods
Niggas like “bah!” man that’s so gay then find out that boy “bah!”
He like no way, it was just that one time
We like, "Ok, we don’t wanna know why, ain’t no need for alibi"
Either way it’s all
Be yourself brody, he love you
Diamond Lane, we in position to bubble, fumble, we takin’ it from you
You heard me bruh -- we takin’ it from you
Boy we’ll son you, whoop you then love you
Man you know haters in a different light
Throwin’ bricks and bikes at the different type
Murder pussies get your mister sniped
Turn your day black as Mr. Snipes
Standin’ in a dark room searchin’ for a kitchen light, muthafucka with the
Shots to the Nazi, Germany birthplace my birthday caused earthquakes
Way over there, nigga like, waaay over there
Compton like "keep that nigga over there"
Hell no this

[Hook 1: HaLo]
She won’t pop it for a profit, gettin’ profit
And there’s no way I can stop it, no way I can stop it
She got a foot in that door, booty galore
And there’s no way I can knock it, no way I can knock it

[Verse 2: HaLo]
The black sound for the background comin’ back around
Gotta have a frown then have the head that wears the crown
Underdog up stream paddle now
Samuari swords on the battle ground
Buds purple and brown, Khrysis to murda sound
The word around now we runnin’ circles ‘round crews
Love it when they hate to lose
Use these emotions to over power you fools
Why? Knuckle up until it bruise
In too deep like that pool stick cue, nigga
Knuckle up until it bruise
You’re in too deep, you’re defences weak
Nigga

[Hook 2: HaLo]
She won’t pop it for a profit, gettin’ profit
And there’s no way I can stop it, no way I can stop it
She got a foot in that door, booty galore
And there’s no way I can knock it, no way I can knock it
She let me pop it in her pocket when she drop it
Oh the way she wop it, oh the way she wop it
I ain’t listen before and got raw and there’s no way I can stop it
No way I can stop it

[Verse 3: Bad Lucc]
Freakishly Hollywood, [?]
[?] night, it's all quiet [?] ha ha
It’s the father of the gun clap and the break beat
Chicken scratch on the lay sheet
Son of Jerome and Mary and legendary that [?]
Fightin’ for the title, rival with Gods and idols
Writin’ ad libs in the bible
One description's like I'm [?]
And bamboos let me cross the land ooh
Certify my emcee card is valid till I can’t move
Pass me my dance shoes and you, you go run amuck
Tell the people how I came
Tell ‘em stories how I bust
Tell ‘em life is full of lessons, either stick or get stuck
Tell him he should be the illest, who is he, he is Lucc
I stand tall, write my name on a great wall like Zorro
Or Spit on Ramo, chased down by the plain clothes
Ross represented and Diamond Lane the definitive
Hail staff, blood bath, vindictive
The last rapper potty trained, shittin’ on the console
I go, go so much as mumbo sauce around the condo
Black out any semi [?] load of pennies [Remy?]
Got me seein’ demons holy water over [?] me
[?] but I can stretch the flow me out the atmos-
-phere never knew such, I’mma walk across the atlas
With a [?] full of [?]
Bitch don’t touch the slice you should know better
Back to the raw get the [?]
Aw, I be prayin’ to God, keep my victims in hot
Aw nigga, naw nigga, who got lose?
[?] Daniel's son was a bitch, I’m Mr. Miyake doggie bag, "ruff!"
They whisper with a whimper, ‘member?
They remember bloody bodies on my timber, ‘member?
So I stockpile styles I invented in mind
So if I ever die no one can ever find

[Hook]
