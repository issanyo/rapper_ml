[Hook : Mars]
I know you wanna fuck, I know you wanna fuck
So what the fuck?
Baby stop playin (stop playin girl)
Stop playin (stop playin girl)
I see you in the club, lookin at a nigga like what (what?)
Baby won’t you stop playin? (stop playin girl)
I’m just sayin (baby stop playin girl)


[Verse 1 : Problem]
You want me to bend you over
Kiss it from the back, hit licks like I stall you
What?
I swag big diff from Compton to Magnolia
They already know I motherfuckin told em
Once I get to Poland they fill it in they colon
Dick too bomb and a bitch start exploding (booye!)
Lil mama so wussup? (What?)
You can slap my mom if you don’t nut
I know I’mma make you moan, I know I’mma make you moan
And even though this is wrong I hope we don’t pull one up
But fuck it I’m lit, I see that you lit
It’s time to turn it up like when they playin my shit
We hop in my whip, you play with my dick
Then take some molly dust and put it right on yo click then mwah

[Verse 2 : Mars]
You know I wanna fuck (You know I wanna fuck)
I know you wanna fuck (I know you wanna fuck)
So what you waitin on? (So what you waitin on?)
Why you ain’t in my truck? (stop playin girl)
Got a tulip in my truck (Got a tulip in my truck)
Won’t you roll me up a blunt? (Won’t you roll me up a blunt?)
Let me up between yo thighs (Let me up between yo thighs)
Or anywhere you want (stop playin girl)
Bring you over if you want (Bring you over if you want)
Get it crackin if you want (Get it crackin girl)
Bring you over if you want (Bring you over if you want)
Smackin on yo thong (Smackin on yo thong)
We ain’t even made it home (We ain’t even made it home)
Then we are in the own
First she didn’t wanna say wussup
Now we on our way to fuck, girl
