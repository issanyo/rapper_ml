(Verse 1: Problem)
Remember when my money was thin as dental floss
Baggin' up in the devil's kitchen
Two step with my fingers crossed, woah
Please Lord keep my mind right
They say when we at the darkest that when you shine light, woah!
I see it, these bottles spark with these hoes lookin', mmm
She doing lines till her nose crooked, damn
Done done it all I done seen too much, boy
So them angry faces don't face me much nigga
Everybody sayin' I'm brand new, oh
Guess that's what's getting this cash due
When you from where I'm from you do anything that you have too
You over-grind and make sure your money outlast you
Family second my grind first
No matter how much that line hurts
Clock tickin' ain't no time for no time kill
Cause my family across be way Fast than my grind will

(Hook)
Shit, just keepin' it real wit my self
If I don't keep it real with me
How i'm gon' keep it real with everyone else
Listen to me, come on
It's too many squared niggas just runnin' around
It's crazy, that fast lane is what slowed me down

(Verse 2: Bad Lucc)
Keepin' it real while I face the traffic
Need a lil' dot square face's a magic
Put up on the scene but the trace are tragic
Backed out laughin', man my heart was jumpin'
A nigga had a feelin' I was startin' somethin'
Hustlin', movin', H.G.Well, I woke up next mornin' all the niggas in jail
So I, slowed up, nervous as fuck I could've throwed up
Took the bitter and I done chose up
From that day on never froze up
I just stay in my lane like I'm taught to do
Play that role and they chuckle you
Snapped a couple niggas and I fought a few
But bad luck ain't never did bad luck for you
All these fake smiles gangsta vouchin'
A nigga never ready for the gangsta pouncin'
All up in ya business, tryna scrape the cash
Talkin' bout you bad when you separate the fountain
I done seen it all, wanna prove you tied
The OG's only keep OG's in line
Lil' homies wid it ain't used to bustin'
They don't remember you when you was out there thuggin'
Run these streets livin' these rap niggas
Talkin' shit forgot about the scrap nigga
Big homie like 'kick back nigga'
Yo Patna, like 'lucky, let me at, nigga'
You ain't learn shit cause you ballin', boy
And you don't even hear the lord calling boy
Bout to be a long night, all in boy
Was headin' to the studio, all in boy

(Hook)
Just keepin' it real wit my self
If I don't keep it real with me
How i'm gon' keep it real with everyone else
Listen to me, come on
It's too many squared niggas just runnin' around
It's crazy, that fast lane is what slowed me down
