[Verse 1 : Problem]
Yeah
Pray for my enemies, I ain't trynna go to hell
I get broke and go to jail nobody's posing bills
But I wanna [?]
Feel the rush, the molly dust
That make me not give a fuck
I'm trynna be a better man Lord
But the devil keep creepin' in my head Lord
He just had the homies bring up for the [?]
His four words was taken [?] before he do me
It's feelin' like that's the real option left
I'm gettin' nervous, handshakin' at the [?]
He's a man I will never underestimate
That's why if he seein' me I won't hesitate

I'm trynna keep my [?] I swear I try
But usually the one who let us slide be the one that die
The mirror teelin' me I need to be the bigger nigga
Put my heart in neighborhood it's tellin' me to go and get the nigga
Go hard, bussin' that's the way we raise
Animals off the cage it's heavy [?] on a bigger stage
Make a nigga feel the rap boy
But be sure it's worth it cause ain't no bringin' back to pass boy
Fuck it I'mma let 'em be
It's feelin' like my biggest enemy is really me
I ain't show off it's the J or the Henessy
[?] go on a killer spree
But my mama let me call up and get the message
[?] take the situation
Where's the church? Man a nigga need to go dawg
Swear to God man it used to be my road dawg
Fuck that! Blow kush now i'm in the wind
It's crazy when you see  [?] you ain't him
Y'all was raised the same way so you know the rules
See that you ain't him, who you gonna choose?
