[Intro: Big Sean]
Ear Drummers
Fuck is my ransom, homie ?

[Chorus: Trouble]
Hey wassup, tell me what's in your cup (what you sippin'?)
You from the hood too, don't be actin' all stuck up
You gettin' money lil' baby, I guess we eatin' (I guess we eatin')
I get to rollin' blunts while I'm talkin' to Gs
Ayy, only the lil' homie stuck
See me runnin' this shit up (flexin')
Ayy, only the lil' homie stuck, big up (talk to you)
Only the lil' homie stuck
Niggas tryin', niggas dyin', niggas greedy, everyday
Shit get real, shit get hard, niggas need you, everyday
Only the lil' homie stuck, big up
Only the lil' homie stuck, yeah

[Verse 1: Trouble]
Guess I'ma hold it down, I'ma hold it down
I can't scratch this shit enough, donâ€™t snitch, bitch, hold it down
Niggas ain't know shit, so quit the switch, don't fuck around
What the fuck you pullin' out the gat for if you don't plan to blowin' it down?
Bitch, you plottin' on yo' main man, I'm lookin' good for that
Rest in peace to 44 P, they hurt the hood with that
Look at all these po' ass kids, the hood fucked up
This shit was never my dream, hustle from fuck ups
Sit back, blowin' some green, talk to the big god
Can you please bless my fam' with tickets too much to ask for
Nigga need ya, niggas tryna be greedy
Just want good for my people, forgive me of all my evils
I don't mean a lot but you're tough and I need ya
Everyone don't fuck, don't give a fuck, I keep her
Baby hit the balls, baby rough on the weepers
Scratchin' like a panther, puttin' bucks on the liters

[Chorus: Trouble]
Hey wassup, tell me what's in your cup (what you sippin'?)
You from the hood too, don't be actin' all stuck up
You gettin' money lil' baby, I guess we eatin' (I guess we eatin')
I get to rollin' blunts while I'm talkin' to Gs
Ayy, only the lil' homie stuck
See me runnin' this shit up (flexin')
Ayy, only the lil' homie stuck, big up (talk to you)
Only the lil' homie stuck

[Verse 2: Problem]
I pay all my niggas, y'all payin' the badge
Live zone 6, with deep mac, trap way in the back (I remember my niggas)
In front of church, guns, a TV and a bootleg DVD
You old players need to stop hatin' on these young ballers
Barkley and Shaq, TNT
Diamond Lane, DLG
Off the seven like BLB
You almost high as GLD
I'm from Compton so I don't expect you to understand my POV
I done bossed up bosses, that's why I said I'm a young OG
Now done sold more than a P and I ran from not one nigga
Have you raised a bitch to lick dick, just come give her? (Hey)
I took too much molly, alert the homies like come get her (fucked up)
Hell naw, if you strapped or if he not so don't fuck with her (yeah)
My niggas gon' be my niggas no matter what, so I'm stuck with them (yeah)
My bitches like bitches but can't fuck, 'less I fuck with them
Like a toilet, that's blocked up, yeah, I'm deep in this shit, no sleepin'
I'm peepin', everythin' breathin', no love in this shit
Go hard as the governor man, and no I'm not lovin' the bitch
Remember when the trap was bunkin'
Niggas I thought I was makin' money off of publishin' shit (Ha ha, that's crazy)
I can't stop comin', that's why I got so many babies
And bitches love a dog, that's why I got so many ladies (What)

[Chorus: Trouble]
Hey wassup, tell me what's in your cup (Diamond!)
You from the hood too, don't be actin' all stuck up
You gettin' money lil' baby, I guess we eatin' (I guess we eatin')
I get to rollin' blunts while I'm talkin' to Gs
Ayy, only the lil' homie stuck
See me runnin' this shit up (flexin')
Ayy, only the lil' homie stuck, big up (talk to you)
Only the lil' homie stuck
Niggas tryin', niggas dyin', niggas greedy, everyday
Shit get real, shit get hard, niggas need you, everyday
Only the lil' homie stuck, big up
Only the lil' homie stuck, yeah
