[Chorus: x2]
E.O.R we have this right we got this tight (Oh my)
Rejuvenating the music we living for music (2x)

[Verse: 1 – Romeo]
Yay!! Am in this game quite funny
Am on this Hip-Hop thing like bugs bunny
Engaged with the music so I can call it honey
For whaa…aat? so we be getting the money
I am in it permanent my destiny is so eminent
E.O.R with no doubt, making rappers feminine
Teach em stuff, to shut their mouth, I know we can handle em
Give em scope, to give em hope, by the time we examine em
Entertainment on the mainstream
Cause we living straight for the music
If not “Hai” I ’ma lose it, without music I ‘ma feel sick
Cause it’s Romeo and oh Jay-T, We E.O.R, We shooting stars
“AH” are we building the bars cause we C.I and we fly

[Chorus: x2]
E.O.R we have this right we got this tight (Oh my)
Rejuvenating the music we living for music (2x)

[Verse: 2 – Jay-T]
Entertainment seems all good
When you come straight from the hood
Where we induce a cough
Dogs bark allot and x marks the spot
Right left we be more vicious when we go back
You’ll fellas need a nap cause you can’t even rap
Sweets presents nothing, I'm not even cursing
True gentlemen aka elephant the obvious is not so obvious
Cause of your own ignorance
But I guess it’s none of my business what is the difference
Mel function and I got the scissors
Spinning the world on a broken axes
Evidence is the pastors
Inspire one and control the masses
Slave ships levelled out of classes at the top we find the masters
Also known as the private assassins
Independent thought is something one can’t be taught

[Chorus: x2]
E.O.R we have this right we got this tight (Oh my)
Rejuvenating the music we living for music (2x)
