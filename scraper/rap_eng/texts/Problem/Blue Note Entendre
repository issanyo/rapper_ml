[Introduction: Asaad (Saudi Money)]

Uh
Let this shit breathe
Shit breathe
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Asaad (Saudi Money)]

Now they come up to me
Like you are my favourite
Eh, I'm chiefin' with a Cusco native
Fuckin' up your head
Should I call up David?
What the fucks am I going to do with all this paper?
Mind growin'
Getting head
Is mind blowin'
Flow so fine
I'm smokin' on this pine
It's potent
Dark dragon, deep down in the black tee
Black me
Perfect temperature
Black tea
Godly sorta
Crushing on the Cosby daughter
North nigga
So you know I had some odds against me
Prominently I shine
Being smart ain't a crime
Beyond fire if it sparks some lines
I'm, the young beast from the heart of the east
Get money young nigga go'an enjoy you a feast
Go'an inspire the hood
Might loan me some cream
For like a brush in my hair (uh)
I'm ownin' the dream
Told Lil' Quill he can be whatever he want
Even a doctor or a lawyer
Don't put up a front
My brother inside fucks my head up sometimes
Whether you know it or not
Nigga that's Millzy in dem lines
That was me on the strip
When all the fiends outside
That was me in the house
When dem coppers kicked in
That was me in the booth
You can hear the sirens coming
Good could be better
Quiet and humble
Thriller than most
I got the world in my hand
You can hear the pain in my voice
I washed the blood off my hands
Blue note entendre
I got a trick up my sleeve
Put the cash on the table
You can't do bidness with me
It's necessary to me
Reciprocity rap
Real niggas here
Smokin' loud in the back
And all y'all weirdos...
It's quiet for y'all
Moment of silence for y'all
Uh
