[Intro]

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Troy A-V-E, straight out of NYC
I rep that BSB and yeah the streets feel me
I touch their heart when I speak
I'm touching women [?]
I'm touching money off keys
I'm touching boys like a priest
With the heat, [?] I'm in tour [?]
[?]
Fighting cases in this court
Some lost, but they really won
Cause shit, what they really done could get them triple life
Or the chair or [?] all in one
365 I am free and alive
I'm too blessed to be stressed, thank the Lord in my eyes
Can't forget my cerebral, on point like a needle
I know some niggas be haters and bitter bitches are evil
You see the Devil's a liar, [?]
My homie Trae is same
[?]

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]
