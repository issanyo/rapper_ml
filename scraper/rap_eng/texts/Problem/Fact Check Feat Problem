[Hook]

I ain’t never rap shit I ain’t never did
Niggas wanna fact check meet me at the crib
Boy you never trap shit boy we on ya lid & jts like that
Nigga got a issue we come right back
She be with the extras but I like that
Niggas already knowing I’m the type that
Fuck off my cash get it right back
It be like that sometimes

[Verse]
Took ol’ boy bitch he ain’t like that
Hit her with a like late night and she like back
Fucked her in the stu kept her mouth where my mic at
Might double back baby pussy had that bite back
1 double O they could never call me phony
Young homie wanna stunt so I let him hold Rollie
In a 98 Buick with a felon and parolee
Bad tags no L’s drako and a 40
Cause slipping we ain’t finna do
Salmon color diamonds match the tennis shoes
Either get it in or we get rid of you
These niggas singing songs like they on when they money really shorter than a mutha fucking interlude
Lord


[Hook]
I ain’t never rap shit I ain’t never did
Niggas wanna fact check meet me at the crib
Boy you never trap shit boy we on ya lid & jts like that
Nigga got a issue we come right back
She be with the extras but I like that
Niggas already knowing I’m the type that
Fuck off my cash get it right back
It be like that sometimes

[Verse 2]

I ain’t never heard a real nigga say he real
I ain’t never heard a killer talk about what he gon kill
Niggas really in that field keep yo head on a swivel
Ima mind my own business I don’t know how to be a civil
If a nigga fuck with mine ima do the whole 9
If it ain’t about a check then I’m never on time
Eastside Eastside that’s only co-sign
Told niggas once that I need all mine
Fuck you thought it was a game
Niggas take me for a joke
Going live if a nigga try to take me for a hoe
That’s on everything I love

[Hook]
I ain’t never rap shit I ain’t never did
Niggas wanna fact check meet me at the crib
Boy you never trap shit boy we on ya lid & jts like that
Nigga got a issue we come right back
She be with the extras but I like that
Niggas already knowing I’m the type that
Fuck off my cash get it right back
It be like that sometimes
