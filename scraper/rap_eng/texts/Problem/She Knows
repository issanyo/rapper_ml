[Hook]

Yeah she knows, yeah she knows
She knows that her nigga can't save her
Surrounded by his papers
She tryna get close, yeah
And she knows, yeah she knows
She knows that her nigga can't save her
She tryna get yours
She tryna get real close
She tryna get real close
Yeah she knows
She tryna get real close
She tryna get real close
She tryna get yours!

[Verse 1]
She knows she knows
Ooh she knows
She just wanna lay up lay up
And watch a movie
She always gets make-up make-up all over my pillow
I just tell her straight up straight up
She ain't the finest
Now, I'm driving all these money
A hundred thousand followers and you ain't got twenty
Girl, I know that you can't run it
She think a nigga gon' save her
But I ain't no savior, no no

[Hook]
Yeah she knows, yeah she knows
She knows that her nigga can't save her
Surrounded by his papers
She tryina get close, yeah
And she knows, yeah she knows
She knows that her nigga can't save her
She tryina get yours
She tryina get real close
She tryina get real close
Yeah she knows
She tryina get real close

[Verse 2]
I like the way your body moves
She like the way I ride the crew
It's my way to the highway
You burnt little bitch, you can fly away
I met a bad real bitch on Friday
She dance it, and said she would hola
She got a baby Danny
And she know I got a BMW
Oh, he ain't a rich nigga and I like it when I see him
See you wanna a role in the play
Fuck you all night and get you money for your hair
You do my thing lil' lil' bitch
We make all night lil' lil' bitch
Grab food, more weed
Feel more drunk, have a drink with liquor
Stay too long, my cuddle bitch kick it
Fuck out! Ha ha!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
She tryina get close
She lookin' for a nigga with bank rolls
In the club is where I found her
She finally made room, and she proud of her
Seen her wippin and she hot, damn
She fuck around in love her girlfriend
It's been about a month, you're moving too fast
You tryina be with the nigga but I ain't with all that
