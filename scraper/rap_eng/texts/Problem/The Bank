[Chorus:] [x2]
Where the fuck you think I’m at?
I’m at the bank
If you're looking for a nigga
I’m at the bank
I’m at the wealth farm
I’m at the B.O .A
I’m at the Suntrust
I’m at the church
I’m at the wealth farm
I’m at the B O A
I’m at the Suntrust
I’m at the church

[Verse 1:]
The realest nigga you ever met in your life before
Game I beat them ten bands
Take me off the child support
Feeling like a new man
These mills turning life unfold
Brother in the feds
He gonna fall and hold the sky in place
Cause he fall
Never regular
Bout to make a movie
Groupy bitches grab your cellular
Instagram the bands
Like the mother fuckers playing song
Fuck it, if she bad
Swear i'm gonna do the pussy roll
Here's the plan
Yea we gonna do the pussy roll
Chop, chop, chop you're black on tint
Each and every pussy go, money
Everything is about the stash
Stay stacking
Sing to two
How to fucking count it, so

[Chorus] [x2]

[Verse 2:]
I’m at the wealth farm
But when the fear of god
I’m at the bank rolling my car goal
I dear a nigga
Try to come and take it
I smoke his head like a marl brow
We jump the line at the B.O.A
Don’t need ID cause we VIP
Early morning have a young nigga
Hit the drop off truck for B.B.T
I can’t see you
Ray Charles
Mack nineties
Eight R’s
Stop using my bank cards
And started using my face card
I be swapping cards like we swap bras
And treating bitches like play toys
If a nigga try to steal from me
You can bet the K
I make them pay for it
Where the fuck you think I met him?
At the bank bitch
Hundred thousand kush
Like a nigga wage bill
At the restroom
Nigga you ain’t taking shit
I keep it on me
Just in case you want a face lift

[Chorus] [x2]
