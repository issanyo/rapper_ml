[Verse: 1]
How would you like it if I was your mentor?
Helped you keep record of whatever you encore?
I could do that, I could be that for you
Endure, secure, ensure…End your problems in the blink of a, “WINK OF AN EYE”
Close your eyes and let me emphasise on the fact that
I never, ever compromise, I serve enterprise
I control the life I live, factorise even the smallest lies, I use both my eyes
You won’t realise it, because your eyes are green but you’re colour blind
You lose your mind at whatever kind of stuff arising
What you find between the lines is not in line with what I define as magnified
Wouldn’t you like me in your life? Huh?

[Chorus: x1]
I’m the influence you been looking for
They make you bored, I got fun in store
I can make you smile, I can keep you busy
I can keep it wild, I can keep it fizzy
You be sounding all instrumental
Thanks to me and my high level, looking presidential
I find it mental, it’s only rental, But you follow me
Cause I’m that influential

[Verse: 2]
All you gotta do is follow your heart and leave your mind behind
Make me a primal spiral till the point where, your tribal rivals consider you admirable
People gone be people, and talk stays cheap
You ain’t even gotta weep, be like me and disagree
Life don’t get easier than that, matter of fact
Let me show you how to be a brat-tat-tat-tat
I’ll be the point of transition, beyond recognition, to see you blend into origin
I’m on a mission to see you make your decision concerning my vision
It’s more than efficient, don’t tell me about no damn premonition
You got no idea about my division or custom; religion
Just hear my voice and make your choice, cause the truth is

[Chorus: x1]

[Verse: 3]
You’re making me lose my sanity...	(0h  Gosh)
I feel the need for profanity, or rather vulgarity
But the fact is, I didn’t plan to be in a place without clarity
With someone who can’t stand to be with something like me as family
Though I put the “rap” in “Therapy”, you still fail to enter my territory
Guess you deserve it, I can be your L’Oreal if you prove you worth it
Bring me planet 51, I’ma prove I’ll earth it
I’m smooth on the surface, Smurfie, It’s kinda perfect
I can be dirty, nasty, classic…whatever you call it, I’m fantastic
I’m the one you look up to, the moment your coffee’s finished
I’mma be the one you bring your cup to
Lemme mess with yo’ head, show you how to make your bed
Bet yet, lemme inspire you instead

[Chorus: x2]
