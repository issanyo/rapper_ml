Yeeeaahh

[Verse]
Bout to make another million of a mixtape
Bang her out then dip out before the bitch wake
Run up on a mark bet the bitch break
When it's money on the line make ya bitch wait
Dog I'm off the chain man the leash gone
Let your marks see now the beast home
Now its time for yall to roll like a fixed flat
Six figure check fuck a six pack
Junior I'm a King, watch my Martin Luther
Feeling like Eazy when he started Ruthless
Bet a nigga do his thing for he clock out
If Like Whaaat was the hit, this the knockout
This knockout
Nigga this the knockout
Fuck the club dog, I'm bout to turn the block out
Young niggas on ten with they Glocks out
But still catch fades cause they crazy with the knockouts
Decisions made with feelings don't end well
Your real ain't familiar, I don't remember you
Smelling like Givenchy and gorilla glue
Bossed up, hired homies, did what real niggas do
It ain't hard to stay motivated
Cause with every win comes another goal
Buy a new Benz save another soul
Pull up swervin they like damn that muthafucka cold

Pull up swervin they like damn that muthafucka cold
