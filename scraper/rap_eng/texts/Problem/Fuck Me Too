[Intro]
Wait hold up, I'm 'bout to turn this bitch up (Ayy)

[Chorus: Problem]
Like the county, all I see is all blues
She love the Crips, but she big SuWoo
I got that dick that make her do what it do
If I was you, I'd probably fuck me too
Like the county, all I see is all blues
She love the Crips, but she big SuWoo
I got that dick that make her do what it do
If I was you, I'd probably fuck me too
Like the county, all I see is all blues
She love the Crips, but she big SuWoo
I got that dick that make her do what it do
If I was you, I'd probably fuck me too

[Verse 1: Problem]
Baby always struck me as a smart chick
Now get over here and hop all on this boss dick
Countin' money all day, I'm exhausted
Fucked baby twice, then I tossed it (let her go)
Countin' money all day, I'm exhausted (I'm so tired)
Nigga drippin' like a fucked up faucet
Damn!
Boy I'm with the business like a office
Damn, damn, damn, damn!
That cutie with the booty tryna do something to me
Tell these rap niggas stop woofin' before I do somethin'
My niggas like Steph with the range, have 'em hoppin' out the rain
Got a hundred in each drum, they ain't even gotta aim
Just let it go

[Chorus: Problem]
Like the county, all I see is all blues
She love the Crips, but she big SuWoo
I got that dick that make her do what it do
If I was you, I'd probably fuck me too
Like the county, all I see is all blues
She love the Crips, but she big SuWoo
I got that dick that make her do what it do
If I was you, I'd probably fuck me too
If I was you, I'd probably fuck me too
If I was you, I'd probably fuck me too
If I was you, I'd probably fuck me too
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me too

[Verse 2: Casanova]
I'm from the Big Apple
You could be a grown ass man, I'll still kidnap you
Gat to your back like "Get in the whip, nigga"
I'm a Blood, and I fuck with Crip niggas that'll hit nigga
'Til the clip done
It's a million ways to die, nigga you should pick one
Ridin' in that hoopty and that shit got high mileage
Bouncin' up and down 'cause that bitch got hydraulics
You would think I'm in the West but I'm ridin' by Ragamuffin
Strap on my lap, mufucka, ain't hiding nothin'
I don't really want to, but you niggas forced me
Yeah I'm in the Porsche, if I crash it's gon' cost me
They see a nigga on, now these niggas wanna hawk me
Saw me with Wyclef, it was killin' niggas softly
Problem
If these niggas want a problem, just get a greenlight, I'll red dot 'em
Boom boom boom

[Interlude: Saviii 3rd]
We gon' do that shit like this, hol' up
That nigga Problem told me to just gas these motherfuckers first niggas 'bout time
Hol' up
Look

[Verse 3: Saviii 3rd]
Ahead of my time, tryna stop my shine
Every chance I get I'm representin' every time
Now she on my line, cause she see me poppin'
Problem know if it's a problem, call up Sav' and I'ma solve it
Ain't no pocket rocket, P89 Ruger, do ya
She ain't got no cash for the gas, bitch Uber
Know a nigga nothin' in this hood but a goober
Baby I'm a joint, he a loser
Lose him, I do this
Watch my do my dance like Shooter
Watch me fuck it up like Shooter
I make it look easy
But I promise it's a real meaning to these therapeutic verses I be speaking
Lookin' at your team and my team, and I was thinking
Your squad full of clowns, but you probably the weakest
I was with the heathens, got a little booty call from Niqua
She talkin' 'bout she pregnant, finna keep it
Nigga that's on Jesus
I ain't goin' for it, bitch beat it
Blue notes singing like Anita
Flex for no reason
Let the wrong nigga get some baggage, you can tell I never had it I be extra and dramatic nigga
