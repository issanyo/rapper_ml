[Intro : Candice]
Am I coming into ?
Okay, alright

[Hook : Candice]
You fucked me like you love me
But I know you really don't, don't
You put everything  above me
But I can't leave you alone, alone
You the (nigga that I fuck with, fuck with)
You the (nigga that I fuck with, fuck with)


[Verse 1 : Problem]
That's a sacrifice to fuckin' with a real nigga
Paid nigga, rich nigga hey listen nigga
[?] plus I'm A1
[?] I'mma hit you when the day's done
Can be on it niggas that's out here makin' case come
You don't be mad when you in the best week relation front
No Instagram and no picture together that ain't [?]
I run my program, we fucked it him up
It's grind time no slow-jams
You knew the deal before you got into it
Now you actin' crazy like you smokin' on him
Buy me fluid everytime we get into it
You gettin' all mad, sayin' you ready to go
Gettin' up set over dumb shit like you'd never know
That it was gonna be like this
Even though we get together
Baby girl you know we ain't together
Stop trippin'

[Hook : Candice]
You fucked me like you love me
But I know you really don't, don't
You put everything  above me
But I can't leave you alone, alone
You the (nigga that I fuck with, fuck with)
You the (nigga that I fuck with, fuck with)


[Verse 2 : Problem]
You the one I know it [?] stop being mad
The pussy miss me I know it do
You homegirls tell you I'm fuckin' I know they do
But I'm single and I ain't married
I'm just too old to just go with you
So damn it why we keep talkin' bout the same shit?
I took you from a nigga, I won't do the same shit
Now it's your turn, got a [?] to struggle
Same reason why you love is why you hate me, my hustle
Goin' hard all day so is you with me is the question
Know I got my hustle first put everything else's in second
And that includes you, and I know that hurts
That's why I spended extra on that purse
Now take off that shirt girl
And stop fucking play with me


[Hook : Candice]
You fucked me like you love me
But I know you really don't, don't
You put everything above me
But I can't leave you alone, alone
You the (nigga that I fuck with, fuck with)
You the (nigga that I fuck with, fuck with)

[Outro : Candice (Problem)]
I wanna leave you, but the dick too good (whaat)
Man fuck this nigga, fuck this nigga
Do I still wanna fuck this nigga, I don't know, I don't know
