(Intro)
What?
What?

(Hook)
Where the love, niggas
Surrounded by white girls, yea they love niggas
I really was, you just dressin like a drug dealer
Got no love for these motehrfuckin fuck niggas
Fuck it it, I let em die

(Verse)
Stay with a zip, no fly
Zone getting dome while my chauffeur drive
It’s precious cargo, it’s Diamond Lane
The same niggas fore the diamonds came
We going in on yall cus them larger lanes
I keep 3 bad bitches, Frankie Lawton mane
Problem so good, the irony mane
Money straight like I ironed it mane

(Hook)
Where the love, niggas
Surrounded by white girls, yea they love niggas
I really was, you just dressin like a drug dealer
Got no love for these motehrfuckin fuck niggas
Fuck it, I let em die
Money straight like I ironed it mane

(Verse)
I made it like I designed it mane
Made them niggas sit back, I reclined the game
I decline the lane but redefined the game
Every flow I know is bout it either time or game
Franklins… pay me bitch
Whoever thought talkin shit would make me rich?
Pull out this dick and I bet she strip
Never ever let a thirsty nigga make me piss
It ain’t possible, thought M’s was impossible
Now I’m feelin unstoppable
And I’m higher than colossal go
Yea, that’s 6 flags
Make a bitch cum fast in that 6 jag
Middle to the bitch ass niggas
That’s forever with the faking
Just got a young shooter, Nick Young to the Lakers
Let’s turn up, put me in the urn if I don’t earn up
I burn up this whole fuckin buiding, rollin, 4 wheelin
My only guarantee is taxes and more children
Cuz I’m a motherfucker, fuck a nigga mother while his brother watch
I think I’m bout to buy another watch
Cook cookin boy, I’m oven hot
Fuck these niggas from here, I came in for the other other other spots
You know, legendary
Met a few rappers that found out somebody’s legend scary as a…
What?

(Hook)
Where the love, niggas
Surrounded by white girls, yea they love niggas
I really was, you just dressin like a drug dealer
Got no love for these motehrfuckin fuck niggas
Fuck it, I let em die
