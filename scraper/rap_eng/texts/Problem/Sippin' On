[Hook: 12:Til]
Tell me what ya sippin' on
Tell me what ya sippin' on
Tell me what ya sippin' on
Tell me what ya sippin' on
Delight, the [?], tequila (Tell me what ya sippin' on)
Delight, the [?], tequila (Tell me what ya sippin' on)
Delight, the [?], tequila (Tell me what ya sippin' on)
Delight, the [?], tequila (Tell me what ya sippin' on)

[Bridge 1: ]
The Henny been givin' me energy, yes it do
Girl, I don't know what got into me
But I like it, yeah, I like it
And I bet you love it, when I'm up inside of it
Baby, what ya sippin' on?
I said baby, what ya sippin' on?
‘Cause I'm buyin' if you tryin'
To fuck with a real nigga like me

[Verse 1: Problem]
Better tell you, shorty with a real one
You can have anything, Hennesey, vodka or tequila
You and your squad, 'til we all tipsy
The homie brought gin, other homie brought whiskey
Mix it all up, let's throw it in a bowl
Fill up my bong, let's hit another bowl
Few more drinks, I'ma hit another zone
Everybody gone, ain't nobody home, so baby

[Hook: 12:Til]
Tell me what ya sippin' on
Tell me what ya sippin' on
Tell me what ya sippin' on
Tell me what ya sippin' on
Delight, the [?], tequila (Tell me what ya sippin' on)
Delight, the [?], tequila (Tell me what ya sippin' on)
Delight, the [?], tequila (Tell me what ya sippin' on)
Delight, the [?], tequila (Tell me what ya sippin' on)

[Bridge 2: ]
Drunk off this liquor, now I'm a nigga, yes I am
Girl, I'm gon' tame your body
And you gon' like it, yeah, you gon' like it
And I bet you love it, when I'm up inside of it
Baby, what ya sippin' on?
I said baby, what ya sippin' on?
‘Cause I'm buyin' if you tryin'
To fuck with a real nigga like me

[Verse 2: Problem]
Yeah, you better, yeah, you better
Your home girl looking at me and she gonna let her
Nigga like me up in it
If she catch me slippin' she gon' fall in love
Do what we and the next thing
We gon' blame it all on drugs
We takin' more shots than a gun fight
Fuck it we only get one life, so baby

[Hook: 12:Til]
Tell me what ya sippin' on
Tell me what ya sippin' on
Tell me what ya sippin' on
Tell me what ya sippin' on
Delight, the [?], tequila (Tell me what ya sippin' on)
Delight, the [?], tequila (Tell me what ya sippin' on)
Delight, the [?], tequila (Tell me what ya sippin' on)
Delight, the [?], tequila (Tell me what ya sippin' on)
