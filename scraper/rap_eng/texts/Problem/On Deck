[Intro:]
Yea
Diamond Lane

[Verse 1: Problem]
I whip Muscato when I'm with my bitches
Tequila when I'm with my homies
If you around me and you ain't my mane
I won't mind if you fuck my ho
I'm out here tryna' do my Kobe
DL this mac, I'm loathin'
You only a bitch, I'm a star
Word to my daughter, send my baby boy no joke
Just hit these joints, I'm flowin'
Seem higher than everybody else
Been killin' shit then I'm reloadin'
Then you could die with everybody else
Her pussy, I'm assassin
Bling bling, that's my chain reation
Nigga on my plug, I'm taxin'
Real surround, my word like captain

[Hook: J.Valentine]
That's on the real
That's on the real, no lie
That's on the real
That's on the real, no lie y-a y-a y-a y-a y-a y-a ah ah
No lie y-a y-a y-a y-a y-a y-a ah ah
Cause I stay on deck
Cause I stay on deck
I stay on deck
Cause I stay on deck
No lie y-a y-a y-a y-a y-a y-a
No lie y-a y-a y-a y-a y-a y-a ah ah
What?

[Verse 2: Problem]
East LA reminisce, with kush smoke I'm ready to go
Got niggas, bitches ready to hold
Niggas thinkin' this big shit talkin'
All I talk is the shit that I know
Practice what I'm preachin' all day
At least ten times a day I pray
These devils sure know how to get to you
Tryna' figure how they know the way, know the way
Up in my garage on the crib then I'm back on em
It's frontin' too hard, bro back on that
Smoke big days of tobacco bruh
No laptop but I better mac on that
Every time we out, diamond lane gang
3 fi fo, come ride in my lane
Niggas love talk but be scared of my game
Oh my Lord did a favor complain
You bad girl, and I need you here with me dawg
Yo man got you in that car
Let me hook up yo ride like repo
Yea I probly won't but
It sound good, when I eat that pussy you sound good
Cause that noise we make and that noise you make
It gonna make my neighbors go call a bank and hold up
Girl show some control
This is the route that I chose
I drove fast as I could, homies show love when I pass through the hood
Don't have to ask and you know that I'm good
Know that I'm good
Say we can't fly, I showed em we could
2-0-1-3 I'm totally booked (for mobbers)

[Hook: Problem]
That's on the real
That's on the real, no lie
That's on the real
That's on the real, no lie y-a y-a y-a y-a y-a y-a ah ah
No lie y-a y-a y-a y-a y-a y-a ah ah
Cause I stay on deck
Cause I stay on deck
I stay on deck
Cause I stay on deck
No lie y-a y-a y-a y-a y-a y-a
No lie y-a y-a y-a y-a y-a y-a ah ah

[Outro:]
I stay on deck
But shit, fuck it, I'm tryna' stay on some dick though
