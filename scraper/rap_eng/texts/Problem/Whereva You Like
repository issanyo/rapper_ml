[Problem (Female in background)]
Hun
I does this
Real
Hey
Let me
Let me ask you this
You want a Problem (Wherever you like)
Do you want a Problem (Wherever you like)
You got it

[Tha Bizness]
Tha Bizness...

Chorus: Problem
Maybe on the couch
Maybe on the bed
Baby, we can do it wherever you like
Get up in the mornin', do it in the shower
Baby, we can do it wherever you like
You can tell me when
You can tell me where
Baby, we gon' do it wherever you like
Get up in the car and take it real far and
Baby, we can do it, wherever you like

(Verse 1)
Problem
I ain't really with that wastin' time
You lookin' good enough to eat, I think it's tastin' time
Shit
I'm a lick you up and I'm a lick you down
And I'm a put you on top and let you ride around
Now
Next then, we goin' to the hood
And we gon' get up out the car and fuck on the hood

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
I'm lovin' you from the face down
But I'm focused on everything from the waist down
I think I'm bout to bust like a trey pound
By the way you move that ting-ting and you make sound
And I love it that you don't care
Anytime, Anywhere, call us 112

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
We can do it at the restaurant
Do it at the movies
I keep you hot and wet like a jacuzzi
Ooohwee
You oozin'
Down, would you turn your moan down
Don't it feel so much better when you can't make a sound
Sshhh...
Quiet on the set
It's good
Bite up on my neck
You know you wanna scream to the top of your lungs, but you can't
Cause if you do, then somebody gon' come

Bridge: Problem
Somebody gon' come
Somebody gon' come
Girl, do you get it
Somebody gon' cum

Repeat Chorus

[Female]
Wherever you like
Wherever you like
Wherever you like
Wherever you like

[Problem]
