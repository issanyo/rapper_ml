[Intro]
I just look at you and I just want to do bad things to you
In a good way though
Excuse me, what's your name?

[Chorus]
Don't mind my bad intentions
But you have my attention
And that don't happen often
So please take heed and listen
You deserve a lifestyle
You deserve the finer things
I ain't talking big house
And I ain't talking―Hold up
I ain't sure if you ready for that diamond ring
But you might be though, you might be though
Ohh, ohh, I'm saying
But you might be though, you might be though
Ohh, ohh

[Verse 1]
How many men have you turned down tonight?
It's so crazy you still shining when they turn down the lights
Baby
Two step with a real one, let's take the next step
You got a man but your home ain't happy
Don't worry baby I got the tools we can build one
Let's spend some time together, we're such a good time together
Let's take a selfie, on God, ain't we so bomb together?
I see you like "Oh, whatever"
Seems like you got it all together
So

[Chorus]
Don't mind my bad intentions
But you have my attention
And that don't happen often
So please take heed and listen
You deserve a lifestyle
You deserve the finer things
I ain't talking big house
And I ain't talking―Hold up
I ain't sure if you ready for that diamond ring
But you might be though, you might be though
Ohh, ohh, I'm saying
But you might be though, you might be though
Ohh, ohh

[Verse 2]
They just turned on the lights baby
Need a walk your car or something
Baby hit another bar or something
Or even better
Give me a number I can call or something
Real talk, far from tight
In the back can be used for something active
We lit, what a sight
We met, what a night

[Outro]
I like you, I like you, I really really like you
I like you, I like you, I really really like you
I like you, I like you, I really really like you
I like you, I like you, I really really like you
