[Verse 1]
Nigga we put our own cellphone with our own bread
Young nigga but I move like a old head
Stood tall through the funk never folded or rat
Cried peace kept to myself never ran to the crowd
Now back to the bullshit hoes still hoes tho
Niggas still ain’t shit different toilet same shit
Nothing’s gonna change except the change in the bank account
We is well [?] while I'm hanging out the mother fucking window
Niggas hoes in my DM
Life dramy free cause I dont fuck my BMs
Haters all around throw deuces when I see them
Unless they want it
Cause I'll cut a player like a GM
