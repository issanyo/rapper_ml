Invite you to my place
Grab you by the waist
Look you in the face then send you to outer space
Believe [?]

Look you in the face then send you to outer space

[Verse 1]
No I don’t wanna fuck with you, I can’t lie
But I love the things you do, to me
And you know I ain’t got no business talking to you
After what I done found out
But fuck that, I ain’t tryna be alone

[Verse 2]
Why, I could let you hit this then go to Mars
Kiss on that pussy until you seeing stars
You got a  G working your G-spot
Kiss it till that peak pop
And lick up every drip drop
I’ve been a bad boy l know
And I don’t deserve this
Chance to make you blast
Even though your only purpose is to cum
Then to go, fuck it
I ain’t tryna be alone

Blast off

Grind nights and brighter days
The fire he sways, nah you can’t love her
This [?]
Ah man you can’t cover that clitoris
Blast off, mind races, sweaty palms
And bouncing arms
Feel like a kid but, becoming
Every time she touches my soul
He touches me
Every time I’m inside of my soul i be
I wanna write breakfast no checklist
Our love is reckless
We do it on the floor like the setless
Young kids with a bido forever
You’ve only got right now let’s, do it together
Separate the endeavours
Kiss you on your head and let you know that I’m your man
And pray this pain will forget us
Fly baby, look me in the eye
I won’t hold you back, don’t let your fears hold you back
Don’t let what steers you right show you slack
But nevermind all that
