[Chorus:]
Got the trigger up, hey
And my nigga want to do something
Itching with us
They gotta take on them too
I swear we at the streets, say what
And we stay busting them moves
They don’t like the way we turn
I bet they all do
Be like that
They be like that [x2]
Be like that
They be like that [x2]
Be like that
They be like that [x2]
Be like that
They be like that [x2]

[Verse 1:]
I’m tired of niggas
That’s lying on digits
My boo’s got my back
And they never be fonting
I like me to Jane
I stunt everyday
For the niggas that told me
I never be nothing
You say your spouse out
I loosen the blouse
On the couch of the hoe
Ain’t go never see bitch
Put that on mama
Your crew our dog
Is the special owner of the pedigree here
All of these tracks
I ain’t gassing and passing
Them niggas that’s waiting in line for the part
Ponny  just got off probation
So now he is able to ride around proud with the pack
Sabba is tweeting and twerking and working
Might nervous but know they ain’t wanting no phase
Niggas that use to be popping
Now drop that
I swear we ain’t never go through that phase
Give me the waiter or pass me around
Pull up that track and that liquor run down
Wanna run now we can let you run down
For lower than what I can get for a pound
Lower not loud
You ain’t making no sound
You're not making a sound
Feeling like I ain’t got nothing to lose
Prick on the risk
Sole on the shoes
Pull out your chick she planning to choose

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
S65, work faster than six hundred nigga
Got the ice out the mud,that ice
That probably worth two hundred nigga
Want to buy chillo, I wanna buy
Imma give this life to my brother nigga
I own new shit, puzzle you
I don’t hang with them busting guting nigga
They banging niggas naked, they gross
I don’t like to talk about it
But they say the conversation rule the nation,right now
Therm fucking riding niggas
Nigga sicker than the patient, ok
Marijuana in my jersey in the club
Smuggle like jamaican, ok
Okay, okay, okay
It’s all went right
Got that red bottom on the luggage
Sevens on them right
It’s suppose to be rosay and high powered
They gonna leave me with stripe
They were suppose to be deep trust
That nigga had to cut out my sight, who that

[Chorus:]
They shot the gun
The trigger run
And my nigga run
Do something
Beat you up
They got to take on the crew
I say we at the street, say what
And we stay busting them move
They don’t like the way we turn, I bet they all do
Be like that
They be like that [x2]
Be like that
They be like that [x2]
Be like that
They be like that [x2]
Be like that
They be like that [x2]

[Verse 3:]
Hopping out a different ride
Everyday I know you pussy nigga hating
Something bet they hold on
Nigga every ride over 150k
Fifty rounds in the K
You better go now nigga
Spend everything on my diamond chain
A say you look like you down with the diamond lane
I told them little cruz GD is a VD on VDL
Hustle gone down with all kind of game
I been a G from the beginning and I ain’t try to change
Born a real nigga
Out of the gang I stand
Even with guns in the ride
I be flying, getting high
I bet the won’t find a thing
I stay riding one time with a million cash
Swear for the crime, I decided to die
All I gotta do is hit a button
Next thing you see a food stash by
I can hide for the day
Could be a mansion standing out in Ankara
You in love with the bitch well take the bra
Make them come hard
Let them change the draws
She was drinking we were skating
Don’t give a fuck if you not feeling me
You still better watch how you deal with me
But you can’t hang around
Cause you ain’t real to me
In layman nigga can’t hang with me

[Chorus]
