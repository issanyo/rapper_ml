Guess who?
You niggas better know what it is

[Verse 1]
There's a problem, more women than kids
... 750, color Eminem skin
Gettin' a win, tattoos cover my skin
And in Compton I need a stack ... that's bigger than ...
No ... but I'm getting it in on you ass hoes
Shit, I'm a flagpole to you tadpoles
... jump, my bitch in equisite pumps
Pretty face and a ...
And I love to watch her pop it like splat
Disrepect the squad, then we ...
Now back to the patch, she throw it like it's lobs
I get high and go get it, then slam it like Lebron
Do it like a vet, I'm sure no rookie
The crowd goin' nuts, and so is her pussy
But back to the haters, go ahead and try me fuck
And our high bullets even make the mighty duck

[Verse 2]
Baby ... Problem got too many styles
He gon' fuck up the game, like a ref that called too many fouls
That's the plan, either boo me or bow; shit, I'm doin it now
Get the bread then I move it around
Shit, just like a fat ass, yeah, move it around
Take a nigga bench, hit the mall, Louie it down
Yeah, that's that diamond lane shit
Have her in the diamond lane blowin' diamond lane dick
It's 365 out of 3-5-4
Nigga, I'm a giant: fe fi fo
This beat's my ho, deep in this bitch
Man, the flow so clean you could eat off this bitch, for real

You niggas still know what it is

[Verse 3]

Fuck swag, stay with the game, word to the ...
Take a swig of the yak, then I look at my chain
Boy shine right, shit this ice screams, it's a Klondike
... on the wrist say the time's right
Used to push a lemon now I'm livin' in the limelight
Yeah, your boy soda poppin', I'm Sprite
Fair game ... it's all change
Quarter of the kush, pennies on my feet
Dimes all around, nickel by the seat
Quarter, quarter of the kush, pennies on my feet
Dimes all around, nickel by the seat
Get it nigga? I'm too much
So 100 boy, you niggas is two bucks
Rolling like two trucks with eighteen wheels
Trying to get these two sluts to take these pills, nigga
Problem
