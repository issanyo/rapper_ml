[Intro: Iamsu!]
Already know, Already know
I already know, she already know
Niggas already know, I already know
Niggas already know

[Hook: Iamsu!] (x4)
You ain't gotta think about it, cause you already know
Million dollar afro, million dollar afro

[Verse 1: Problem & Iamsu!]

[Iamsu!]
Yeah you already know, yeah we all for the dough
Poppin' stacks real fast, make it back next show
Hustle all around the globe, all cash no tax
I love boom and dance, Neiman Marcus & Saks

[Problem]
[Bitch it's problem and Suzy, gettin' that guap,]
Basketballin' pick it then pop
Hoppin' on planes, kickin' at shop
Rap don't work, we hittin' the block
Don't let us see in? We pickin' the lock
Bitches go nuts when I'm lickin' her twat
Momma we made it, we are the greatest
Did it with faith, Biggie and Pac

[Iamsu!]
I'm too smooth like Al Green, your girlfriend arousing
I stay on chinese, fried rice no chow mein
Always on the campaign, tax niggas like Bowman
The way that she dancing, she might pull a hamstring

[Hook] (x4)

[Verse 2: Problem & Iamsu!]

[Iamsu!]
They don't wanna, they don't wanna, they don't wanna, they dont' wanna rock
Gaye said it's hot, fuck it who wanna box
Just what I thought, nobody. So high, a nigga can't see nobody
How your bitch be buzzin' like a shot shot shotty, two timing you got another molly, woah
All about business but God is my witness, I work her ass out you would swear it was fitness
You think I am kidding but no I am not
Always on grind, I stay on the clock
No clocking out, they know what I'm 'bout
My name like a food, it stay in her mouth
RIP to my foes, Amen to my dough
Backstage on my show, I might take off your clothes
Get down and get lost, got that A1 sauce
Girl you know that I'm a boss, so I paid that cost

[Hook] (x4)
