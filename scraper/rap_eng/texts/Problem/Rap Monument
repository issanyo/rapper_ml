[Verse: Problem]
Got Mary blowing Jane
We fucking high, sex on a plane
Hey newscaster, we about to rain
Get love in the club because we fill the section with pain, c'mon
Blow him up, finna explode
All of hell's kitchen praying he don't stick to the stove
God got me, illum-i-not-me written in bold
Slept on, now I'm everywhere like g-g-g-go crazy
Buy 150
Let me tell y'all now, I want nikki
Lift her up like helicopter far away from her fellow
Let her play problem
While problem tongue play with propeller (what)
Keep fresh just in margielas
Diamond lane running thangs ain't shit you can tell us (don't tell us nothing)
Done everything, ain't shit you can sell us
Money over bullshit, friction derail us (naw)
Compton niggas, yeah we take it or leave it
Know once it's almost over tryin to ?
You nervous, like them cutters he'd inject the speed
Ask (beep) if any muthafucka faking me my nigga (what)
Yeah I bet a nigga crawl to the crown
I'm a boss, hire hoes while I buy the loud
See them niggas shaking hands and biting styles
Got her to stay city in cause I fired her spouse
Cause I'm a mad man
Just fuck niggas like the Klan, man
Put you to sleep like the sandman
Give me the throne, I'm a chairman (diamond)
Rolex beat, it's time for winning, no fakes
Just copped more 4 5's and 9's and I ain't talking bout no J's
Please be afraid but I ain't the shooter
Chachi-palooza
Riding shotty in the chevy bitch old as a cougar
Lyrical ruger, pop your medulla (uh huh)
You lukewarm, boy, go get you a cooler please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
So cool I could fucking die if I drop a few degrees
Boss daddy, use the porthole please
Get it good girl, use your knees
I love them brainiacs
Yeah, my last ho had a few degrees (for real)
Back on my Compton shit
Demonic how I demolish shit
Angelic with my intuition
Student of game make hoes pay tuition (huh)
No dice, no pill, but I'm on a roll
That one nigga that Kendrick can't control (what)
Problem
