[Verse 1: Too Short]
I'm dancing behind her
What she gon' do that vagina
I'm humpin' and grindin', but it feels like I'm wasting my time
I'm about to go hard on this bitch with my dick
I got a clean ass car and if she get in my whip, immma hit
I ain't runnin' no game, I don't give a fuck if that's your woman, I ain't playin'
I tell a bitch, exactly what I want, lick my dick all around from the back to the front
I can't date her but I can make her squirt and cum, shrivel and shake her
Fake niggas beg for the pussy
Real niggas don't ever say "would she?"
You fake niggas, kiss hoes booties
But that's where I kick 'em if the bitch don't do me

[Bridge: Problem]
Ho
Don't be callin' me, to take you out to dinner
You need to recognize, ya' talking to a winner
We don't wait, ain't no drinkin' my drank
Smokin' up all my weed, yappin' 'bout what you need

[Hook: Problem]
Bitch fuck that talkin'..
Wassup with that pussy though(x4)
Fuck all this talkin'
Wassup with that pussy though(x3)
Fuck all this talkin'
Wassup with pussy though

[Verse 2: Problem]
Bitch you better understand it!
Don't take this good dick for granted
Slide inside you can feel it in ya' tummy
Pussy eatin' nigga with a whole lot of money
Neva' with the funnies, hood like a Cutlass
Take too long, I'mma fuck yo' cousin
Straight like that, I don't give a damn
And when I'm done, go back to ya' man
'Bout to go hard on this bitch with my dick
Lick these balls while I roll up this zip
Gone off a Molly. I'm on my tip
25 hater for a pound, that's a quick flip
On momma's!!
Wrap it on up, then send it to ya' hood
Rollin' off Goose, I'mma give it to her good
Pull it through the hole, like kicker
Gave me head shots, I ain't talkin' 'bout pictures!

(Hook)

[Verse 3: IAmSu!]
In a real rich city, she got real big titties
Got a Asian, black and white bitch with me, uh
Call it neapolitan ice cream, good brain no scholarship
Hah you know she got good grades
I get pussy, get head, and get paid
Paper by the book, no spades and it's Heartbreak Gang we ain't playin' no games
Yatzy, CHACHI, and me go stupid, I pull up in that coupe and they be like where the roof is
Throw their stars, call me a boss, take a bullet 'fore I take me a loss
Bitch nigga, ahh. And bitch I be in grind mode
Every other day, different state, different time zone
And ho I get my shine on
Plus I got cheese and bread like a calzone

(Hook)
