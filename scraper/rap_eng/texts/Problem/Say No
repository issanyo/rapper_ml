[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
I’ve never seen you around, could you be new in town?
Tell me would you like it if I laid your body down?
I’m sure that you got a man but he ain’t with you now
So I know you know what's 'bout to go down, down
If it’s alright, we can be out
All night, 'til the sun’s out
In the morning, girl, I swear that I'ma change
I'ma quit the game but 'til then, I'ma play

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Every time I try to get my act together
She be saying she can’t find nobody better
Sometimes I swear I wish I never met her
Everywhere that I go, I be trying to say no, say no
Every time I try to get my act together
She be saying she can’t find nobody better
Sometimes I swear I wish I never met her
Everywhere that I go

[Verse 2: Problem]
All these girlies love me
All these girlies love me
You would think it’s ’cause the money
Why these bitches wanna fuck me
But that ain’t all it, nah
‘Cause I know my thing when I’m in it
I unzip it, then I kiss it
Have it bangin' in minutes
Like booyah, wow
Your love is all everywhere
I see your water keep on flowin'
Please somebody put a levi there
'Cause shits overflowin’, I’m goin’ deep like the loin
You want me come to your house
I’ma take that ride like I’m towin', come on

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Every time I try to get my act together
She be saying she can’t find nobody better
Sometimes I swear I wish I never met her
Everywhere that I go, I be trying to say no, say no
Every time I try to get my act together
She be saying she can’t find nobody better
Sometimes I swear I wish I never met her
Everywhere that I go

[Verse 3: Eric Bellinger]
I be tryna to be faithful but it’s like they know just when to call
When I hit the road, at the same time and they blow up my phone
Can’t be faithful when there’s so much love over there
I be tryina play fair, my boys they be sayin’ beware
‘Cause they know
It’s hard to leave the trouble alone
They know
But I don’t pay ‘em no mind at all, so let’s go

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Every time I try to get my act together
She be saying she can’t find nobody better
Sometimes I swear I wish I never met her
Everywhere that I go, I be trying to say no, say no
Every time I try to get my act together
She be saying she can’t find nobody better
Sometimes I swear I wish I never met her
Everywhere that I go
