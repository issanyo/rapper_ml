Maxx out, maxx out, maxx out, maxx out
Maxx out, baby walk around with that ass out

What that shit do, roll in the six coupe
Kick it like juitsu, mama what's the issue?
Her ass soft like tissue, keep your mind right or the boy might diss you
I'm 'bout to cash it was [?]
I swear we're blowing up fast like a missile
Cold like polar, add it in solar, [?] is a young nigga movement
Damn, tell me what's the deal, though?
Young Veggies and I give it that deal dough
Living life real slow, swag worth a mill' though
Problem is a problem, I'm a scholar getting dollars
Uh, I graduated to the money, air max ones and I'm racing to the money
If a nigga try to chase me, then I'll break up him the money
[?] homie I'm a nice pick
Then she chose up on me then she do some nice shit, word
A hundred bands make a chick twerk
Yeah I'm running land make a chick work

Hook:
Maxx out, maxx out, baby walk around with that ass out
If she fuckin' with me cause I'm racked out
Fuck all that just maxx out
Maxx out, maxx out, maxx out, maxx out
Maxx out, baby walk around with that ass out

The homies stay heating like a sunner
Want a problem is a heal nigga runner
Live every day like there ain't no ma√±ana
I'm the motherfucking one like a dollar
Spend that, pussy I'll be in that
He got my eyes Asian, I'm yelling where they in that
Nigga inked up like a pen pack
Write the cheque, [?] so I like to flex
Bitch looking for love all I'm looking for sex though
Nigga dick got a bitch moving fast like techno
Casey, let's go, let's get on the move
We'll be gas and petrol, big bust and metro
First dollar [?] , diamond land game feeling like death row
In the club with more bottles than a fucking BevMo
DLMG, L.O.S let's go!

Hook:
Maxx out, maxx out, baby walk around with that ass out
If she fuckin' with me cause I'm racked out
Fuck all that just maxx out
Maxx out, maxx out, maxx out, maxx out
Maxx out, baby walk around with that ass out

Yo I'm hitting the club just to maxx out, right
Hit them lights, it's a black out
Mama got her ass out, so you know I'm tryin to take that fast route
Racked out, like the old school Jerry Stackhouse
Turned up my whole city hits the club
And I don't need much just some titties and a nug
If you ever in the Vegas you know that dizzy is the plug
Pretty and she young, I got that killer for your lungs
Young player I ain't done, doing this for fun
Hit it 'til she numb, baby where you want me to come?
Nasty nigga no one like me, excite me
She twerking on the dick but she do it better than Miley
I wanna see you:

Hook:
Maxx out, maxx out, baby walk around with that ass out
If she fuckin' with me cause I'm racked out
