[Hook - Manolo Rose][x2]
Let me talk my shit
[?] my back as I park my whip
Yeah ho, please get a grip
It’s money on the phone, please don’t trip

[Verse 1 – Manolo Rose]
Yeah ho, she begging me to take her
Her man came with a cape, he’ll save her
And ratting on me to my bitch, that ain’t [?]
She want to ride with a boss cause my money major
I came up, I’m tryna stay up
I done came a long way from driving a pace up
I’m sitting courtside with Jag just watching the Lakers
Catching highlight after highlight
I need two bad bitches to get my mind right
Where the freaks in this bitch?
Type of freak to suck the dick while you’re sleeping and shit
Bitch I’m grown up, they call me sho nuf
When you talk big money, it’s like a foreign language
Get with me bitch

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2 – Problem]
They don’t want it like arrows, good in every barrel
All about dinero, pull cards no Taro
Live like a pharaoh, still give you the fair one
The future, but still classic as an air one
Nike, your wifey wanna write to me
Talk tough, you better tread lightly
My power high as a tower, feeling Eiffel-ly
You lames left, now it’s feeling right to me
The plug hitting my back phone
This that shit for the real niggas to latch on
The drought’s over, where’s your paper at, we back on
Knuckle up, it’s time to triple up, have a backbone nigga

[Hook][x2]
[Chorus : Manolo Rose]
Please, please, please don’t trip
Please, please, please don’t trip

[Verse 3 – Stoney Tha Dealer]
One time, got the hood in a vice grip
So I ain’t trapped nothing today, I took the night shift
That’s right, come and get your fix from ten to six
Eating [?] courtesy of your favorite bitch
Dealer, let me talk my shit
Pull a lighter out then spark my spliff
Pardon my back for I squeeze my clip
Weapons cost too much, I can’t afford to miss

[Hook][x2]

[Outro]
Yeah ho, please don’t trip
Yeah ho, please don’t trip
You see it
They know what it was and what it wasn’t here before
Alright, play this first one back

[Hook][x2]
