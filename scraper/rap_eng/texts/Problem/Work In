[Hook] (x4)
I just got the work in (no diggity)
I gotta bag it up (bag it up)

[Verse 1: Que]
Said I got pounds, good lord
And I got them workin' all over town
Strictly business, don't play around
Ship em' out of town, UPS Ground
Gettin' paid is my forté
Each and every day, true hustla way
Y'all nigga ain't got time, well
We ain't gettin' caught with nicks and dimes, well well
North side to the south side
Push a lot of pie, bitch it's no surprise
I got bricks in the stash, stackin' up cash
Plug when it comes to the gas
My dope ain't average
The right amount of cash, you can have it
A white lady is a ten
She my best friend
Can't come in cause I just

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got bags of loud
Get 'em going before they even touch down
Make the J’s act wild
You know I gotta keep a low profile
I got work for the low, so
Let me tell you how it go
Purp's the herb in the birds
Prices so low, nigga fuck what you heard
Told her what direction
You never gonna know if I have it
You got to pay to play
Tough for me to say, [?]
I just got the work in
Keep the white all day, everyday
It'll blow your mind, hit it one time
Dope so good all you need is one line

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Problem]
Turkey bags of kush, bales of HD
My hustla pays me, I'm bout to bust an HP
Shine it up, lookin' flossy in my trap spot
Thing tuckin' while the motherfuckin' rats plot
You need a whole thing or a half block?
Same clothes for days with a fat knot
Money make me feel like I'm above the law
This how it sounds when the plug call: "brrrt!"
