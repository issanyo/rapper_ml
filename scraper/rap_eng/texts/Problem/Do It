[Verse 1 : Problem]
Turn up, money burn up
I do it daily, Adidas and a beeper
I'm from 80's, you slap my mama before I let you march play me
Your boyfriend mad cause he fucking hate me
For real though, yeah, for real though
Racks fall rap, yeah, I got that real dough
Weeds keep fire, so I smoke the kill though
Keep it 100, got the hundred bill flow
Yeah, it's me though, Problem, shot, she pick a name

Do it, do it, do it


[Verse 2 : Problem]
Pay the cost to be the boss, now I need the change
Lying in the car pool, yelling out D lane
Don't know about y'all but I want the money and the fame
And the chain, and the hoes, and the cars, and the clothes
I'm a real one so I say it, in a cab, I don't play it
Like the angel do it in the league
If you ain't talking about money, let me intervene
Turn y'all on just to gain
They want me to hurt them like they freeze from the pain
Girl ganged out, I don't creep with you lames
My shit banged out, in the streets, fucking thangs


[Hook : Problem]
Hell yeah, I got all this girls
But my main objective is get dough
100 every time I'm out, yeah, homie, I show up
Do it, do it, do it
I really
Do it, do it, do it
I really
Do it, do it, do it
I really
Do it, do it, do it

I'm rich and I ain't gonna lie, just trust me
And you ain't gotta ask your girl how to fuck me
See, I'm ready for it, and I know you are, too
Full with that brain, yeah, I know it all, too
Put it in your mouth like where we go it all full
And when you done do the same to my crew
I don't mind, yeah, I'm with that thumb shit
Getting high, showed off in the hood, off some young shit
Off a show, I'm still in the streets like a bum
Never, ever catch me as no bum
But I got change


[Hook : Problem]
Hell yeah, I got all this girls
But my main objective is get dough
