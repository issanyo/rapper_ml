[Intro: Problem]
You know I’m harder than you
Ridin around not getting at ass niggas
Dumb fly niggas
Nah nigga, uh man
Stay on nigga, for real

[Hook: Problem]
Every time you see me I be on, I be on
Every time you see me I be on, I be on
Every time you see me I be on
Every time you see me I be on
Every time you see me I be on
Every time you see me I be on

[Verse 1: Problem]
Every time you see me I be on
Fuck on who? I can smoke up on half a zone
I’m like a captain, drop the dozen in my liquor
I’mma dog, yea I fuck before I kiss 'er
Diamond Lane again, I’m ridin' for my team
Roll up on me and you see just what I mean
Well you better pray to Lord before you cross me
Balls itchin' like a nigga, never wash 'em
And that means I be getting money for you dumb bitches
Stay high, serve dick to these young bitches
Money talkin', all these hoes love my lingo
The only thing big as this dick, is my ego
It’s all the niggas and I know because the moves that I be makin'
I am the man because the risks that I done taken
Just tick some more dust, now my whole body is shakin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Problem]
To get high as me, yo ass gon' need a ladder
My girl a dime, my other bitches swear they badder
Swag on foolies, on my mind don’t let me think
I’m callin, have my youngins knockin' I don’t question
Holy Water, oh my God I freakin' feel it
Any pussy in my way I freakin' kill it
Where that molly? Give it here, I pop it now
Call up yo girl to her house then knock it down
Every day it’s about dollars so you know I’m out here cakin'
They go on top ‘cause of the risks that I done taken
Haters got a mind, yea I see they body achin'
I don’t know about you but…

[Hook]
