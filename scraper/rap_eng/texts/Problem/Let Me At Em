[Intro]

Bitch better fuck something
Bitch better fuck something

[Verse 1: Wale]

Shows in L.A., shows in the bay
Centerfolds in the pool, got her rolling up a jay
Tats all over, cash all over
500 laps, NASCAR Chattanooga
Bow down tell them bitches pipe down nigga
Bow down, when I come up to your town nigga
I'm surrounded by brown women and brown liquor
And green trees, my name heavy make the ground quiver
Ridin through the city I'm bagging bitches what do you know
Counting a bag with spanish mammies on the [?]
Trying to get mad, I told that baby get at me
I could blow out all your candles on your birthday suit

[Hook:Fat Trel]
Pull me up a four super slow
Rolling dope boy
White bitch, white liquor I for sure fuck
Turned up niggas with me they don't give a fuck
Tell that bitch let's get it cracking
I don't give a fuck

Let me at em
Let me at em
Let me at em
I'ma tear that pussy up

Let me at em
Let me at em
And tell them niggas my niggas don't give a fuck, like
Let me at em

[Verse 2: Problem]
[?] drinking gin with the [?]
[?] knock the knee right out your taco
[?]
[?] bitch mulatto
Got her seven digits then I hit her like a lotto
Play her im a winner, eat her like dinner
Mama raised a sinner, pray to God the lord forgive her
I'm d-boy fresh every time you see me out
Trying make a million every time I leave the house
She's got a new whip, now I'm riding with your spouse
Let her pop a [?] Then I skeeted in her mouth
She said she got it all but I see some on her blouse
Ratchet ass rabbit chasing cheese with a mouse


[Fat Trel]
Pull me up a four super slow
Rolling dope boy
White bitch, white liquor I for sure fuck
Turned up niggas with me they don't give a fuck
Tell that bitch let's get it cracking
I don't give a fuck

Let me at em
Let me at em
Let me at em
I'ma tear that pussy up

Let me at em
Let me at em
And tell them niggas my niggas don't give a fuck, like
Let me at em


[Verse 3:French Montana]
Forty-four long knock the tats off your body
Packing up arenas from the packs in the lobby
Money got a whole lot, know we buy the whole lot
Flushing when the door knock
Shout to Petey Rollock
Chuck Taylors all black, Raiders
Money right, dirty money, dirty sprite
Give her loose change let her run loose
Came up out the mud to the trunk roof
Fight night shotgun Makaveli
Trying to put it in her mouth, Akinyele
I rip a tag and the ceiling off
Banana clip Mulsanne peeling off

[Hook: Fat Trel]
Pull me up a four super slow
Rolling dope boy
White bitch, white liquor I for sure fuck
Turned up niggas with me they don't give a fuck
Tell that bitch let's get it cracking
I don't give a fuck

Let me at em
Let me at em
Let me at em
I'ma tear that pussy up

Let me at em
Let me at em
And tell them niggas my niggas don't give a fuck, like
Let me at em
