[Intro]
Aight

[Chorus]
Huh, starin' at my Rollie, it's about that time
Less about talent, more about your grind
Go against mine, we gon' come back fine, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's comeback season far as comebacks go
I'm not here for X and O's, this ain't tic-tac-toe
Ain't no love around this bitch, so I ain't got none to give
Now I done slowed down with the old, you see what happened to Bill, yeah
Y'all know that I'm a Problem, so know that when y'all approach 'em
I'm driven by the dollar, might as well call it my chauffeur
I do this for the love, I don't do shit for your approval
Y'all catch me drivin' poundie 'fore you catch-man, hold up
Diamond Lane, we never losin'
And me? I'm never changin' sides even when we wrong
So what? Chachi read the bang and ride, boom
Shoutout to Bang, he just lost his mother
Mine alive, use mine, shit, you like my brother
To all my niggas, like a bed, bro, I got you covered
Niggas trip, I do my shit

[Chorus]
Huh, starin' at my Rollie, it's about that time
Less about talent, more about your grind
Go against mine, we gon' come back fine, yeah

[Verse 2]
Salute to God
I heard these niggas wanna shoot the god
I find out the bullets rippin' and they shoot the god
Diamond Lane, bro, salute the mob
It's truth in eyes, nigga, look at mine
Nigga, look at mines
I don't take days off, everyday 'bout the buck
I don't give time to these pussies unless I'm 'bout to fuck
Remember talkin' to Uzi up in his Bentley truck
Young nigga, keep movin', fuck 'em, just get the bucks
'Cause they gon' hate you anyway, chyeah
The minute they don't like you, they'll remake you any day
And you'll be sittin', puzzled, like, "what happened to my pieces?"
And all your team be gone, it just be mommas, aunts, and nieces
Fuck these industry niggas, I treat 'em like polices
Motherfuck 'em, never trust 'em but be careful when I see 'em
'Cause they ain't ready for real action, huh
For real

[Chorus]
Starin' at my Rollie, it's about that time
Less about talent, more about your grind
Go against mine, we gon' come back fine

[Outro]
Diamond
