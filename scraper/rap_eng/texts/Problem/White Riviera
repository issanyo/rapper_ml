[Hook : Stoney]
Here's a lil story about a Eastside nigga
Fly motherfucker, everbody call it dealer
Came up on a plane from his Westside partner
Every time he bang it loud for a pack he say I got you


[Verse 1 : Stoney]
Two niggas, one white Riviera
That nigga used to think he put the pedal to the metal
Back then I used to get the pound for the fino
[?]
Trap talk from the real dealer packer
Says the lil nigga used to hop the dought up in my hand finger
Born from a Taaka Vodka [?] liquor
Used to chip me up my money 'till I learn to count it quick
Hard times cut me up on my shit now I'm seein' clearest
Started rappin' cause I'm tired of [?] the lyrics
You never choped, you never fucked, you never bust a mission
You never copped, you never [?] you never bust presciptions
You're not a blood, you're not a crip, you'se a fucking gimmick
And that bitch you clamed you fuck said you never hit it

[Bridge : Stoney]
Now the line around the corner but the shop closed
I gotta run nigga shop closed (I went to meet the plug)
Now the line around the corner but the shop closed
I went to meet the plug
(Dealer)


[Verse 2 : Stoney]
Got that, double bag
First sale of the pack before a thirty sack
My nigga bleed he [?]
I told brother like to double keep the wood crackin'
Servin' out the window like the burger stand
Bad bitches and the homies get the ground for ten
Growin' up all I wanted was a bank roll
I got a line around the corner now I can't close
(Dealer)
