[Intro: Problem]
You found it hahaha
You found it hahaha
You found it hahaha
Hey you gonna put some of that Cazadores in a cup for me?
(Diamond Lane)
What?!
Yea

[Hook]
What you reppin', bro? (aye)
What you reppin', hoe?
What you reppin', bro? (aye)
It's what I reppin', hoe
Three-five-four
It's what I reppin', hoe (what)
The realest that you niggas ever seen before

[Verse 1]
Stunting on these niggas is a hobby (yea)
Paid like I'm in Illuminati (yea)
Gettin' money my niggas who your p[?]
[?] stackin' like the county, check
Run up on me nigga I'm for surely with the funky
Dust you off and pick my daughter up like it is nothing
I put this on my ballers and EBT niggas
Get a nigga punch'd like my TDE nigga
Chachi, Diamond Lane, three-five-four, tho
West side Compton, east side warzone
You know the city split where that 110 sit
My niggas on ten, we done drunk ten fifths
Chachi, what you on? They just got to know
Still deliver Ps, call me Dominos
No soccer, but I done hit a lot of goals
Your favorite bitch, bro, I done hit alot of those

[Hook]
What you reppin', bro? (aye)
What you reppin', hoe?
What you reppin', bro? (aye)
It's what I reppin', hoe
Three-five-four
It's what I reppin', hoe (what)
The realest that you niggas ever seen before

[Verse 2]
We 'em niggas, we 'em niggas, as far as Compton go
What I hear otherwise, its hella comical
Where these bitch niggas keep me laughin'
John Wall, Steph Curry with the passin' tho
Diamond Lane gang, if you askin' tho
But first, why you askin', bro?

[Hook]
What you reppin', bro? (aye)
What you reppin', hoe?
What you reppin', bro? (aye)

Three-five-four

The realest that you niggas ever seen before

[Verse 2]
Yea, yea, yea
Heard the streets been sayin' something, what the fuck they talkin'?
There'll be no verbal responses, we'll just get to chalkin'
Hit the vape then yellow tape and so proceed with caution
Hit your gym with lil' shooters, but ain't talkin' Boston
But I got a bird with me, bro, we fly as hell
Keep them gunners but I'm down to let them fly as well
Didn't like the number, so I changed my clientele
Loyal with the ball but never let my clients tell
I got some niggas I ball with that's gon' die in jail
Before they go against the code they rather die in jail
(Three-five-four) Let your diamonds yell
Ball or fall, Heaven bound or we gon' fry in Hell
Gather for this diamond lane shit
Niggas thought they would never play this Diamond Lane shit
(woahoh)
Yea, life is like a box of chocolates
No, life is like a box of options
Would be further, but I got a conscious
You know that fuck shit I ain't gettin' with
Compton Peter Pan on his nigga shit
Bro, I see you shinin', Snapchatin' from your nigga shit
You ain't got no hoes 'cause you too busy riding niggas dick
I won't say no names 'cause that ain't cool and I don't benefit
I don't benefit, quite frankly, I don't give a shit
Life's just a bitch, so who cares if you nothin' hoe
If you ain't down to die for what you reppin', what you thuggin' for?

[Hook]
What you reppin', bro?
What you reppin', hoe?
What you reppin', bro?
It's what I reppin' (oh)
Three-five-four
It's what I reppin', hoe (what)
The realest that you niggas ever seen before
