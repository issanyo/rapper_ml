[Hook : Omarion]
And that’s why she always want me back
Me back and I know it
And that’s why she always want me back
Me back and I know it
Believe me, believe me (I know it)
She needs me, she needs me (I know it)
And I know it,  and I know it (She needs me)
And I know it, and I know it (She need me)
And I know it, and I know it (She need me)



[Verse : Problem]
I protect that to show dick I confess that
Her baby daddy and collect that
So trust it, she out and take that
So I flip and fuck them hoes
It’s all about you and me
Midnight grash, I’m probbaly gonna pull up by 2 or 3
We progressin' with time, I’m progressin’ your mind
I’m not your man, you’re not my girl
We’ll be that when it’s time
So scared of how all this starts
Knock that pussy the most
Spontanious, we gonna leave the bed to go fuck in the car
