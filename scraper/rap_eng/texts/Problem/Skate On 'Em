Pull up at the light
Wait on it
Wait on it
Wait on it

Green light
Skate on 'em
Skate on 'em
Skate on 'em

Oh, make a jealous nigga hate
Then watch the rims when he skate
Skate on 'em
Skate on 'em
Skate on 'em

[Verse 1: Problem]
Fuck her, need a better ho
Let her ass walk, bro
I got 11 more
89 octane, need 11 more
It's the light, roll the dice
Better let 'em show
Hard chrome 7, V12 revvin'
Paint black, inside pecan leather
Get loose, apple juice, amaretto
Cîroc, kush, got me high as heaven
What it do, my nigga? What's happenin'?
What up with Short? Straight discussin' this mackin'
Keep it playin', but if you was runnin' lip
My goonies always packin' like they on a trip
Bodies duck and dip til the ground's stable
All it is's real ones at our roundtable
Wanna piss a hater off?
Count cash, oh!
Push, better start
Then gas on em
What?

Pull up at the light
Wait on it
Wait on it
Wait on it

Green light
Skate on 'em
Skate on 'em
Skate on 'em

Oh, make a jealous nigga hate
Then watch the rims when he skate
Skate on 'em
Skate on 'em
Skate on 'em

[Verse 2: Too Short]
From a block away you can feel the bass
I always drive fast
I ain’t here to race
Inside, it’s like I’m live at concert
Beats so loud, it sound like a monster
I see them niggas lookin', fuck 'em!
Wonder how it got so clean? My shit is custom
I throw a middle finger your way
If you're driving too slow
And you all in the way
A motherfucka might shoot you on the interstate
I’m in a hurry
Hell no, I ain’t fin'ta wait
I’m on a money mission
I’m closing deals
I’m a pimp, I be on these hoes for real
You’re just a stupid ass fuck behind the wheel
Pull over, you don't wanna get killed
Cause if you ain't driving fast
You're messin' with my cash
Every driver around me can kiss my ass

Pull up at the light
Wait on it
Wait on it
Wait on it

Green light
Skate on 'em
Skate on 'em
Skate on 'em

Oh, make a jealous nigga hate
Then watch the rims when he skate
Skate on 'em
Skate on 'em
Skate on 'em
