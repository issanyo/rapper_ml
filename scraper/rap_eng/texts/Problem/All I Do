[Verse 1 - Jahlil Beats]
Fly young nigga, nigga I’m the shit
Bad bitch with me and she bouncing on my dick
Got racks in my pocket, throw it on yo chick
She don’t waste time, she gon suck a nigga dick
Rollie on my wrist ho
Shawty said I beat it up like Klitchko
Throw that money in the air, Shawty get low
Getting head in the cab while I sip mo
Ball on em, nigga I ball on em
Make it for a real nigga so they call on him
Got the shit lock, nigga never fall on em
Hoes poppin, I’mma stack the money tall on em
Tell a bitch make make it clap
Make it clap and them bands I’mma make it snap
Dope nigga and this money I’mma make it stack
Told the bitch shake yo ass then throw it back

[Hook - Jahlil Beats]
All I do is get money and get bitches
All I do is get money and get bitches
All I do is get money and get bitches
All I do is get money and get bitches

[Verse 2 - Jinsu]
I’m just a young youngin
I’m hittin bitches, clackin doors
With a lucky charm treatin my dick like a pot of gold
Grow it adorn, I’m with it then we can start the show
Throw that ass back pourin mo all over them hoes
You with the business, I lick it stick it, I’m getting with it
Hittin older women, you got kids, bitch I ain’t trippin
Blowin my jack, my niggas pourin it up
Pack a loud, blowin it down, Kells rollin it up
Nigga what? Im getting money, bad bitches on the stand by
New J’s fuck em, I get em all by the landslide
Probably on some Henny, feeling nice though my man high
Maybe hittin yo bitch, doggystyle or that ?
I’m on fire, nigga give a fuck about the hatin
My shades on, got my fuckin pupils dilated
See any nigga in my way, I annihilate him
Don’t put in words so yo bitch fake it
You niggas basic, just face it
On that kid and play shit
My day bitch, yo main bitch, not knowin she ate kids
Greatness, A list, was statements, just face it
Know on the low I’m your niggas’ favourite and plus

(Hook x2)
All I do is get money and get bitches
All I do is get money and get bitches
All I do is get money and get bitches
All I do is get money and get bitches

[Verse 3 - Problem]
What? This that that gasoline flow
Big dick swingin, boy ask yo main ho
You fucked up, my life sweet as mangos
Being with the wind, feeling like an angel
I’m flyin straight through the hood and shit
Gotta pay for the homie, let’s jug a bitch
Goons no Neptunes but they good with clips
King is you gotta deal with, you lose them chips
If you want to, you want to, brought one bitch
But I want two, I want two, she a ho
But she can come too, can come too
Stay on my toes like it’s no shoe, no shoe
On my motherfuckin fizzy, my youngin Jahlil all on the biz-eat
Son about to ball on yo bitch, shout out to BZ
Solar baller bailing around like I’m 10 deep
Still got me sittin 10 feet, nigga tend me
You better not though
Bet my code name in yo chick iPhone
Never say yea to any bitch I know
Nigga I go, wuddup? Fuck it! Problem keep goin
Fuck fuck fuck em, yea Problem keep hoein
With all of these bitches, with all of these riches
I collect it can't let my haters get neglected
Ah ah ah ah, pockets big as Texas
Ah ah ah ah, push the L like Alexis
Ah ah ah ah, I got a girl named Alexis
I eat that pussy and I don’t wanna say breakfast
‘Cause thats what them other corny niggas out there saying ..

Yea!
