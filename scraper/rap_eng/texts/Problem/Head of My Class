[Intro: Scooter Smiff]
Uh, uh

[Verse 1: Scooter Smiff]
Now let's get down on the floor
I'm runnin' through all the girlies hair like a comb
They always want to roll with a fella after shows
Snap a camera-phone, hold on, let me pose, cheese
That I'm gettin', swagged out with it
This top dog don't chase no kitten
Only bread, can't nobody can stop me from
Pullin' up in a Maserati to my junior prom

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Scooter Smiff)]
Oh, oh, I'm ahead of my class (ayy)
Oh, oh, I know you heard what I said (ayy)
Oh, oh, I'm ahead of my class (yeah)
Head of my class, head of my class, oh, woah (yeah, ayy)
Oh, oh, I don't need a hall pass (ayy)
Oh, oh, I'ma hit the gas (ayy)
Oh, oh 'cause I'm ahead of my class (ayy, hey)
Head of my class, head of my class (hey)

[Verse 2: Scooter Smiff & (Chris Brown)]
Now Scooter Smiff went up the hill
He rolled back down with a Interscope deal
Just got my check, now I'm 'bout to hit the mall (uh-huh)
Put my shades on, let me show you how to ball (let me show you how to ball)
Catch me at the spot, they all go nuts
They say I'm cocky, I'm like so what? (They say I'm cocky)
My chain all rocky, it's iced on up
Then pull it like Muraki, I'm 'bout them bucks (oh)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Scooter Smiff)]
Oh, oh, I'm ahead of my class, yeah, yeah, yeah (ayy)
Oh, oh, I know you heard what I said, oh, woah, woah (ayy)
Oh, oh, I'm ahead of my class (yeah)
Head of my class, head of my class, I'm ahead of my class, y'all (yeah, ayy)
Oh, oh, I don't need a hall pass, oh, woah (ayy)
Oh, oh, I'ma hit the gas, oh, woah (ayy)
Oh, oh 'cause I'm ahead of my class (ayy, hey)
Head of my class, head of my class (hey)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Yeah, your boy 19, drivin' something European (yeah)
From head to toe I'm stacked, I'm rockin' D&Gs (okay)
Or even my Bs do, anytime I breeze through (yeah)
Any hallway, gettin' Scooter out the classroom (yeah)
Teacher lookin' fine, I think I might holla (okay)
Scooter gettin' straight A's when I hit her with them dollars (yeah)
Jimmy Choo's or them Pradas, they come in all sets (yeah)
I'ma be a teacher's pet when she sees what's on my neck like

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Scooter Smiff)]
Oh, oh, I'm ahead of my class
Oh, oh, I'm ahead of my class (ayy)
Oh, oh, I know you heard what I said, oh, woah, woah (ayy)
Oh, oh, I'm ahead of my class (yeah)
Head of my class, head of my class, oh, oh (yeah, ayy)
Oh, oh, I don't need a hall pass (ayy)
Oh, oh, I'ma hit the gas (ayy)
Oh, oh 'cause I'm ahead of my class (ayy, hey)
Head of my class, head of my class (hey)

[Verse 4: Scooter Smiff & (Chris Brown)]
Cruisin' down the street in my go kart
Pulled to the side to stop at the park
Hopped off the whip to get the scoop
On this fly little thing that was lookin' cute
I shot my game at her and what do you know? (Wassup?)
My moms hit the phone, I've got to go (huh)
So I gave her the eye so she knew the business
Before I rode off, she slid me them digits

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Scooter Smiff)]
Oh, oh, I'm ahead of my class (ayy)
Oh, oh, I know you heard what I said, oh, oh, oh, woah (ayy)
Oh, oh, I'm ahead of my class (yeah)
Head of my class, head of my class, oh, oh (yeah, ayy)
Oh, oh, I don't need a hall pass, I don't need it (ayy)
Oh, oh, I'ma hit the gas, I'ma hit it (ayy)
Oh, oh 'cause I'm ahead of my class (ayy, hey)
Head of my class, head of my class (hey)
