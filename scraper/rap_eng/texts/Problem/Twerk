[Verse 1: Problem]
Well guess who’s back in the motherfucking high
With a point 4 four for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize and niggas do too
Your girl fuck me cause your dick is boo boo
So what that shit do, you really don’t know?
Be a bunch of paper bro, trust no ho
It’s silly as v to fall in love with a bitch
If I can make her come if I got a big enough chips
Four to bounce for, got dick for days
Got em wondering, how long, l.a. ballin
We getting my pow on
Now a nigga looking for some pussy to chal on
On so wassup, I’m with that nasty shit
Pop a pill turning nothin to a nasty trick
Tequila in my system and a half of zip
For how you bust it like a massive clip, good lord!

[Hook]
Feel you baby, yeah I’m tryina feel you baby
That inside do, tryina put this inside you
But first you gotta bend over
And just twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk
Twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, right in my sight

[Verse 2: Bad Lucc]
Hey, how you doin lil mama, let me whisper in your ear
Tell you something that you might like to hear
Got a sexy lil body and your ass look fat?
Hmm, can I hit that?
I’ma take it from here then
My pimping friend told me I should break her from here then
Asked for her name before she opened her mouth
I snatched her keys bought a purse and like she taking me out
I gotta do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
She like the music, I like her
She like the music, I like her
Fuck it, we go together, like the weather when I change my mind
That boy got the bizz, come to your house ignore the kids
Where the fuck is the fridge
Won’t you twerk it for a real and let me do my stuff
And if you put that p down let this d go up

[Hook]
