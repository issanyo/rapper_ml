[Intro]
La MÃºsica de Harry Fraud
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, let's go

[Verse 1]
From the jump I wasn't trusting these niggas
You might see me with a few but I don't fuck with these niggas
I'm feeling new here, I'm a 1 of 1, like the New Year
Play me stupid, tell 'em quickly, "I grew, I wasn't flew here"
My [?] the streets [?]
Tried to tell him don't play street 'cause the streets not playin'
So don't ask me 'bout shit 'cause the streets not sayin'
Boy take your ass to church 'cause them streets are prayin'
At all times had to speak what's on my mind, never timid
Gave a gift, that's my ribbon from the sky, I just live it
Til I'm gone I'm aimin' for the throne
[?] shots to the head now I'm aimin' for your dome
I'm gone, nobody's home

[Chorus]
I've been thinkin' unholy
While we're speakin', I'm just thinkin' that this nigga don't know me
He don't give a fuck about me or the one came before me
Never been to your momma house, hoe do not call me homie
I just start up the parties, hop in and dip, on my way
Street politics and ignorance hit me way different today
And the way I know to fix it is way different today
Fuck all this barkin', all this talkin', PO go get the 'K

[Verse 2]
But this is a better day, homie we move now
L Gang is the future, bruh we the new now
Your bitch was huffin' and puffin' til I got blew down
And I'm gon make sure you niggas see it like I blew down
On my momma you niggas better be scared bruh
I'm so ready to jump off, I'm on the ledge bruh
[?] in the sky, roll my bread's up
The only thing that could stop us is the Feds bruh

[Chorus]
I've been thinkin' unholy
While we're speakin', I'm just thinkin' that this nigga don't know me
He don't give a fuck about me or the one came before me
Never been to your momma house, hoe do not call me homie
I just start up the parties, hop in and dip, on my way
Street politics and ignorance hit me way different today
And the way I know to fix it is way different today
Fuck all this barkin', all this talkin', PO go get the 'K
