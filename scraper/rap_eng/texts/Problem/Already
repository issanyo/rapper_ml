[Intro: Problem]
Motivated by the paper, faded like taper
Drinks like these bitches, I rarely ever chase it
Motivated by the paper, faded like taper
Drinks like these bitches, I rarely ever chase it


[Verse 1: Problem]
Motivated by the paper, faded like taper
Drinks like these bitches, I rarely ever chase it
Every second is a dollar, so time I never waste it
You fake then find a mirror, sometimes you gotta face it
But you ain't the nigga that you think you is bro
100 on the wake up and I put that on my kids bro
Miss my dog Miller, ain't afraid to let the tears show
This shit would drive you crazy but I still gotta steer yo
So I just be dippin, I ain't trippin off no hoe shit
'Cause life is do or die, I'm getting high listening to Po Pimp
I'm twisting up the next J, I smoked with all my premros
Took a killer shot, hit them liquor store then reload
Feelin like a Cheeto, swig on infinity
Really it's that nigga that these niggas all pretend to be
Baby I'm a never gon give a fuck if bitches feelin me
I'll Gang energy, balling like it's 10 to me motherfucker


[Hook:Problem]
I'm the nigga and I know it already
Bitch I see you want my dick, go ahead and blow it already
300 thousand dollar whips, I done flowed already
Done saying we them niggas, we done showed em already
We dem showed em already, we dem showed em already
We dem showed em already, we dem showed em already
We dem showed em already, we dem showed em already
Tired of saying we them niggas, we dem shown em already


[Verse 2: Problem]
The turn up ain't gon stop, you niggas better know it
To have mo green than us yo ass gon have to grow it
I stay with so much tree, you think I have to grow it
Grab the mic then beat these niggas, yea I have to do it
Do things hi way, dippin down a pair of ya
No I ain't playin shit like a car with no stereo
Ya'll grind is inferior to mine
Stall the whole show, all I took was some time
Now them crackers after us, look at how it changed
It was supposed to be this way, that's why I don't look phased
Bullshit convo I never entertain
My side bitch dumb though she heavy with the brain
Kinda hard to explain but I will try to, I'll game music is all I ride to
Quite simply cause it's better and I'm just tired of being lied to
By these motherfuckin dust mops, quick changing flip floppin ass motherfuckers
That's Kid


[Hook: Problem]


[Verse 3: Bad Lucc]
Motivated by the paper, kush turn into vapor
In the hood like Is and Yaki knockin down rackses and bakers
Slammin on the pedal, got these itches in my vision
Fat boy talkin shit, expose the cell, this is my mission
Stand out in the it crowd, they chearin like go Luccy
Lookin my appearance, the way she steerin she gon fuck me
The say I got a potty mouth to be sayin what all be fakin
Laid down til I have a seat and that pussy I be breakin
Slurpin like a fuckin kid, I take my fresh as altro
No keys what I'm out for, got a boo impalo alto
Mobbing on my base shit but I'm LA bred and born nigga
1-0-6 in town there, come through get fucked like porn nigga
Smoke good, it's Cali nigga we smoke good
Ridin fast to that avalanche then I made a left to the folk hood
Chain swingin on hot speed, I'm heckin favored you know the deal
Told bitch mic after T shirt spot me, 3 X and that's for real
