[Hook:
I don't know anything lil' mama tryna' give that thang to me

Every show but I know one thing I for sho' sho' sho' gon' see
(Yeah I need some more ones, ones, ones, ones, ones)
Give that thang to me
(Yeah I need some more ones, ones, ones, ones, ones)
I for sho' sho' sho' gon' see
(Yeah I need some more ones)

[Verse 1: Iamsu!]
Guess I'm back to the ATM
Back up in the spot they go crazy in
Bitch shake ass like a professional
Ho wipe me down, oh you don't like me now
Psh, please, give me 5 feet, hard as concrete
When I'm on beats, niggas on freeze
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout ay?
That's the catch phrase, niggas hate and they catch fades
Heartbreak gang ho, goin' mango
Get it from the back make you say my name ho
Hah hah, shabooyah, roll call I'm too hot
Racked up, Ghar Mula
Stupid cold, I'm cooler, cooler
Niggas losers, I hustle and maneuver
She don't know what to do first
Is it give me bread, give me head, or both
You know I'm gettin' bread for days so make a toast

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Problem]
Yeah I'm toast deaf, fades I catch
Smoke five Js 'fore I eat my breakfast
Knees that toast, I gets them loafs
Ho I got girth, you gon' feel these strokes
Baby I'm the nigga, go head ask about me
Come chill with the stars, get to astronautin'
Bend it over and clap it for me
Then rock the mic, yeah I love to see the mouth work
Broad bands now give your boy the concert
The bomb squad, but we bomb first
Want me in your grass beads, mow the lawn first
Turn it up you a fool with that knob work
No soda, no coin, but I make a dime squirt
Granted, Bentley, Tell me, it's realer in that building
That we 'bout to sign that big deal
Let's go off to that other land
Now quick pull yo' panties down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kool John]
Yeah I see you lookin' bitch, you bout to be tookin' bitch
I'm hot like a cooking bitch, Rex tryna book a nig'
Bury sand and shook a bitch
I'm on like a light switch, I ate her like a dike bitch
My dick can make you fatter bitch
Shmop life comin' up, freaky bitches shake her butt
Beggin' me to keep it up, Cause a nigga need tonight
I be fucking up her guts, Kool gettin' hundred bucks
Smokin' on the purple stuff, hoppin' over hurdles brah
Yeah she back it up and watch a nigga run
Young shmop nigga with a dick like a bowie
Shmop boy cool brah tour like Louie
It only took the freak one time for her to knew it
Shake it don't break it, all I need is you naked
Yup get on a position, get on yo knees and take it
You lookin' real cakey, said her name was Stacey
Can't nobody replace her, can't nobody erase her

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Bad Lucc]
Fat boy said it, took his cookie man thats fat boy credit
I get it goin' like a train, II do my thang
And baby bangin' like a gang, river my hangs
It's gravy, ass crazy, It should be committed
I'm wit' it, but I'm fuckin' lazy
So I smack it from my chair, gave her a stare
I do that pussy like Nare, I'm doin' baer
What? I'm the nigga, you fuckin' feel me
I put a seven in that swisher, I'm fuckin' silly
I just be chillin', got a thousand in my grip
I took a 5 and made it drizzle on that bitch
I'm toasted, street sign posted
Man that ass fake? yo stripper name should be Bogus
Bitch I'm the coldest, and all my niggas focused
They know this all the ills in the air why they chose us

[Hook]
