[Intro]
Do you think we need one more?
You think we need one more
Alright, we'll get one more
Ooh ah, ooh
Ooh ah, ooh
Ooh ah, ooh
Ooh ah, ooh

[Chorus]
Baby let me thug for you
Let me make sure nobody don't fuck with you
You might be around a thug or two
You might be around a plug or two
Baby let me thug for you
Let me make sure nobody don't fuck with you
You might be around a thug or two
You might be around a cuz or two

[Verse 1]
Have you drippin' 'fore I kiss it (ooh ah, ooh)
Come hit a mission with a nigga (ooh ah, ooh)
FaceTime while you rub it (ooh ah, ooh)
Mama's boy but I be thuggin' (and I really really love it)
Gotta get the bag, ayy
Get the bag, keep a bag
Ain't comin' home by eight but I for sure make sure you straight
It ain't nothin' like she dated when a real one coming over
She get hectic, hit my line, guess who comin' with the blower
Boo you good?

[Chorus]
Baby let me thug for you
Let me make sure nobody don't fuck with you (yes)
You might be around a thug or two (yes)
You might be around a plug or two
Baby let me thug for you
Let me make sure nobody don't fuck with you (that's what's up)
You might be around a thug or two
You might be around a cuz or two

[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]
Baby let me put some thug in you
Know I'm high so let a nigga put some drugs in you
She a square but she be fuckin' with the drug dealers
Plus I heard her daddy was a thug so I stuck with her
I put that molly in my mud when I fuck with her
She slow it down and speed it up, I fell in love with her
Ain't eat her out, I beat it up, she expected me to cuff
I'm nothing like your man, I'm too much realer
Won't trick but I got you
You just my lil partner
And fuck what they say
These people just poppin'

[Chorus]
Baby let me thug for you
Let me make sure nobody don't fuck with you (yes)
You might be around a thug or two (yes)
You might be around a plug or two
Baby let me thug for you
Let me make sure nobody don't fuck with you
You might be around a thug or two
You might be around a cuz or two

[Verse 3: Problem]
Had to remind her like you know who you fuckin' with?
Mister international, bitch you still on fed
Zone four on a ho, what the fuck is big?
I do it gigantic, my pimpin' titanic
Bitch I been braggin', ain't shit happenin'
With your funky ass
Them square niggas you was fuckin' with might let it pass
Only time I'm pullin' up is to collect my trap
If I'm getting out of bed better be some cash
Put my Fila's on
I spent a hundred thousand just on Regal chrome
Sittin' on them fours, daddy lookin' like a beast
Sittin' on them fours, daddy lookin' like a beast
Baby say she like it when I flex on her
Fuckin' with the yacht, I blew a check on her
Told the homies she my bitch and I'ma keep it cool
Nigga out of line, I'ma do the fool (yes)

[Chorus]
Baby let me thug for you
Let me make sure nobody don't fuck with you
You might be around a thug or two, shit
You might be around a plug or two (that's what's up)

[Outro]
Ooh ah, ooh
Ooh ah, ooh
Ooh ah, ooh
Ooh ah, ooh
