(Intro)
Uh. Got me all this concrete
Body tick tickin like my time piece
I don’t know why we letting time pass
You know you need to get over here wit yo fine ass

(Chorus)
Dancing, touching on each other baby that’s what it do (yea yea)
Feels so good that way you do it
Sex so good, make me feel brand new, brand new
Make me feel brand new
Sex so good, make me feel brand new, brand new
Make me feel brand new, brand new

(Verse)
Stand up, don’t stand down
Seated up, put yo face down
And here I could have you moaning
But you gotta get on another level
And you gonna turn that baby
Right here, all in my face
Let me just lay you down
Treat yo body how you want it to

I’ll freak yo body all night long girl uh
To you, I gotta take over yo back so I’mma move around

(Verse)
Turn up, never ever turn down
Pop that pussy, I’ll never ever turn it down
Need to rain through the snow like the man
Love to give you ding-a-ling, no bell
Get it? girl you bout to
You don’t need a pill to get that freaky thrill up out you
Did my own work, so I know the real about you
Got me breathless, yea I can’t live without you
Hah, think that’s the only way I be speakin
And now they got me steppin
Baby I tried to spend like a weekend
And eatin, and we can live like it’s on and then smoke it to mouth
Kill you with a blunt, I dumb out

(Chorus)
Dancing, touching on each other baby that’s what it do (yea yea)
Feels so good that way you do it

Sex so good, make me feel brand new, brand new
Make me feel brand new, brand new

(Verse)
Girl you got it
So good, nigga had to tell his daddy about it
He was like what what?
I was like yap yap
And he was like is she the one?
And I was like I don’t know
It ain’t bad just yet but I know that shit fine though
Have me out of here like the motherfuckin tires blow
Switch switchin positions in kitchens, no intermissions
Just kissin, pull out the iPhone and type it
Now she my bad intuition
I gotta tell er, she listen
She know the dealy, I’m really
You freaky motherfucker
And she love that
She do my topy so sloppy
Then jump up on me then ride me
Then bend over then bust it bust until she come back
Sneak back to the back to the back

(Chorus)
Dancing, touching on each other baby that’s what it do (yea yea)
Feels so good that way you do it
Sex so good, make me feel brand new, brand new
Make me feel brand new
Sex so good, make me feel brand new, brand new
Make me feel brand new, brand new

You make me feel brand new
Everything you do make me feel brand new
Everything I got on is so brand new
You know what I mean, don’t have to say it girl

(Chorus)
Dancing, touching on each other baby that’s what it do (yea yea)
Feels so good that way you do it
Sex so good, make me feel brand new, brand new
Make me feel brand new
Sex so good, make me feel brand new, brand new
Make me feel brand new, brand new
