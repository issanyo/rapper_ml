[Verse 1: Saudi Money]

My niggas want to rock for you
Bust your ass, lose your life, get shot nigga
Rest in peace 2Pac nigga
27, hope I don't get caught slipping
White lighter, only ask for usual
Rolling up weed, Res on my cuticles
Count big face Zen is beautiful
But God is ugly, strikes down just to ruin you
Life is boring like a caveman
Lifes hard work like a slave man
Life will have you sick like Aids man
Love live life everyday man
Where the weed man, now we need him
Hungry nigga eat anything you feed him
A rich nigga will buy anything you sell him
And a broke nigga believe anything you fucking tell him

[Hook]
Welcome to the valley
And now welcome to the valley (yeah)
Welcome to the valley (yeah)
And now welcome to the valley
Welcome to the valley (valley)
Welcome to the valley (yeah)
Welcome to the valley (valley)
And now welcome to the valley

[Verse 2: Saudi Money]

My young boy bust your ass if your pop fly
'88 gang valley gang street life
171800 Is what I fucking rep
And I arrive for my niggas dying for the set
Day 1 niggas still here, something locked down
Hold my nigga crack down, books stacked now
Hold your head, be home soon is a cliche
Kim Rock doing 20 to 40 where he stay
How does momma feel, the judge ain't lose sleep
He'll be roofing niggas everyday a hundred a week
Modern day slaves, yeah we still got them
Spent a bundle on a cotton, because I love shopping
What would Jesus do? What would Saudi say?
I'd have a book and a bible if I die today
Celebrate me like a holiday
Long live 27 nigga out in May

[Outro]
