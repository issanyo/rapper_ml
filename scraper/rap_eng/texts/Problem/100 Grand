What's happenin'? from the Rich'...
Where them niggas get active
Can please tell me somethin' that I don't know?
Me and the gang we're going loco
I got a cold flow, these rappers broke though
But I won't help them I will melt them
Rumpelstiltskin, they was sleepin' on me
I got a problem, I always keep something decent on me
They think I'm fucking with 'em, they think I play around
I keep it real so the real always stay around
I keep it underground, ain't it your funny style?
Mad cause a nigga getting money now
It's the gang, huh? We in this thang, huh?
I spent your whole paycheck on this chain, huh?

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
I'm rolling like I'm bowling and I'm striking like I'm posing
People looking at me like I was chosen
You know the big dog gotta keep dosing
Every day I get it in, shit, I just win
Bitch, I'm 100 grand, ten racks times ten
You kiss ass and I don't follow that trend
Choppa on deck, send whoever you wanna send
Gorilla game I'm doin shit they ????
If you ain't bringing money to the table you can vacate
You be up all night staring in the ice box
I be making deals buyin shares of the right stock
I'm a cool cat, I don't really like cops
In and out the jail, making bail, bitch, my life hot!
I'm always in the building, cause I built it
It's all breast feed, you know I milk shit

[Verse 3: Problem]
All the real niggas know the name Problem
Diamond lane real on it, fast car
Wood on the dashboard, all about the cash board
Make the money fast forward, make it bitch give me that like I ask for it
Treat the hood like Nascar, exotic whip trunk in the front bad boy
Elephants in the room, pretty with pretty goons
Flip the script with direct shots like Beanie Boom
Fuck that where the bitches at
No big buildings but down town is where your bitches go
Little Compton ass nigga with the vicious flow
Niggas careers, bout to do where the dishes go
Watch cost me a brick of blow
Bitch before you come grab some zags from the liquor store
Cause a nigga try to smoke something
Cali only bought it back ye no frontin'

[Verse 4: Kool John]
Tell these straight things I'm about, I'm about riches and bitches
I'm about being the sickest, cause niggas know I'm the realest
Suzzie on the beat he knew I was gonna fill it
He knew I was gonna kill it, I whip chamber it with it
He put me against the best of MVP every time
They want these hot rhymes, they're killing in every line
These niggas rap good, but these niggas really lying
We're seeing these cash money, now niggas is big timing
We're fucking with my cash, man you're fucking with your life
I ain't saying I'm a thief, but a nigga fuck your wife
I'm riding like a cock, got these fans screaming outside
Got your bitch screaming, now she wanna fuck a jackpot
I got the gold chains huff back smart pack
Huff hatch smart swag and your bitch love that!
I never slipped up I'm 50 G'd up
Trying to get my dick sucked, trying to get my gwap up
