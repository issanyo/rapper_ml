[Hook]
Feeling like a rider for real
Got a bag of that kill and it’s jumping
Call up my foolies and chill
Yeah the turnup is real
Pop a molly, you feel
Cause it’s jumping
Nigga is jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping
My nigga is jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping
Like boing, jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping
My nigga is jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping
Like boing

[Verse 1: Bad Lucc]
Hey, I’m tripping, I see a nigga want to fade, I’m clipping
Bottle of the spade, it’s some win it, I flip it
My nigga lil loc in the building and he crippin
I got a whole bag and that dust for the function
I got the squad on my back and it’s nothing
Fist full of paper talk shit out the car though
Bitch looking at a player I’m a star though
Bm, baby bm, my song in the mail
My ace g’s, pushing seal
My killas on bail, I blow rack
Clack packs, and four fifty fours
I’m a mac, all that, you slow
Bitch I’m go, whaddup
My foolies in the rock, it’s a block party
Pop shit, get the Glock, it’s a knock party
I turn it up, my beat on the brain
I’m swinging be in that lane
The D.O.G. on the chain, whaddup

[Hook]

I brought a gang of weed, now where the bitches
After a cup of that potion bet I can swim in that ocean
Check out the motion, explosive
Boom, boom, 2 bomb on a bitch
Slide when I dip
My watch sales ready to push the line if you trip
That molly got me ready, I’m heavy upon my turn ups
Your bitch ain’t bout that brain
Bet I can make her learn up
Just have my straight turn up
Unless she swallowed it
Got the number in my head, I lottoed it
Her friend found me up on twitter
Then followed it
Fucked her too, I’m a dog and I’m proud of it
Problem, you know me well
Stay on a bitch head like a ponytail
Trynna get a mill like the homie bail
Take your drank, 2 step then I throw her here
