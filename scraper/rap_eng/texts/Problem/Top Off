[Intro: Problem]
Hold on
Did the 9th Wonder fucking files come in yet?
Goddamn!

Hey 9th, we gon' get some money this year baby
Hey man, I'm feeling good with my shirt off
Know how I get it
Diamond!

[Chorus: Problem]
I'm riding with the top off all summer
I'm riding with the top off all summer
With the top off all summer
I'm riding with the top off all summer
With the top off all summer
With the top off all summer
With the top off all summer
I'm riding with the top off

[Verse 1: Problem & Airplane James]
First off
Take your top off
Too real to be knocked off
$200 slides, my socks off
It's movie time, I'm box office
With or without the watch flossin'
Be cautious, no losses taken this year
They always thought we'd have a problem making it here
Pun intended
No money issue is unattended
And as far as my attendance with the women, may I be forgiven
I'm just not committed as I am to gettin' it
Freshman year, senior, yeah, I been had the vision
God my witness
I'm first class fly, ring the school bell
Hammer on the waist, no tool belt
Smokin' weed with a dime, straight relaxin'
Bet I have her ass comin' in 5 like a Jackson
Quentin Tarantino with the action
Everyday's a flick, in your hood, post it like a pic, nigga no captions

[Chorus: Problem]
I'm riding with the top off all summer
I'm riding with the top off all summer
With the top off all summer
I'm riding with the top off all summer
With the top off all summer
With the top off all summer
With the top off all summer
I'm riding with the top off

[Verse 2: Problem & Airplane James]
This so I could see niggas reactions when I pass them, skrrt
I'm loved in a section where niggas get murrked
Used to want the Benz with the frog eyes, small times
I had the niggas that was ill-advised, I had to cut 'em off
And now I'm...
I'm riding with the top off all summer
Probs' comin', the broads runnin'...
In my direction, all fiendin' for my erection
Claimin' they real as me, but fakin' in them injections
Them hoes got
Digital dashes, leather seats make they clothes drop
Whip coke white makes her nose hot
Wrong rap line will get you cold-cocked
[Tryin'?] a thug, but your soul's not
Really squared in a closed box
But boy, if you want some, come get some
Get close enough to see what's what and then run
You betta' (zoom)
Them taggers that kept it crackin' all summer long
My '17 summer song, for niggas that's dead and gone
Boys back season, better get involved
Or you could watch me get it all, that's your choice
But know this, "I'm not to be fucked with"
I learned the hard way with who I can build trust with
Temporary fakes is temporary bitches, I done had enough with
And all the what's up wit's
Nigga cut the small talk , you niggas all talk
Niggas all bark, code red
If you comin' for my head, I'mma make it easy

[Chorus: Problem]
I'm riding with the top off all summer
I'm riding with the top off all summer
With the top off all summer
I'm riding with the top off all summer
With the top off all summer
With the top off all summer
With the top off all summer
I'm riding with the top off
