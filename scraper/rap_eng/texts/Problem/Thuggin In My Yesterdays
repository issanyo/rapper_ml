[Intro:]
Uncle Chanti, can you tell me a bedtime story please
Alright, you kids get to bed. Let me get the story book
Okay
All tucked in?
Yeah, yeah
Here we go

[Verse 1:]
Last night was turnt, fell asleep at this bitch house
Woke up, still drunk, baby crying, my dick out
Grabbed a bar of soap, under arms, then I hit the balls
Charged up my phone, grabbed my keys, then I hit the yard
What now I’m a thuggin in my yesterdays
New money, same clothes on from yesterday
I’m on my grind this ain’t no type of stuntin
Ain’t got time to go home, I gotta check on something
Plus this broad I just banged stay close to where I be at
Pull up the light
He stepped out, shouldn’t he about to be back
Cool, let’s play a game or sumn
Two hundred dollars, 2k, we tryna favour sumn
I got the like

[Chorus:]
I see you out here thuggin in your yesterdays
New money same clothes on from yesterday
You was on man, I see you all up in the mix
Show up plus I fucked on that lil bitch
That I was dancing with before I left the Yadada
Got up and that pussy went wider than a Mardi Gras
Oh man
Is that right? Yeah
Let me make sure my facts right
So you fucked that little thing that I saw you with
For sure, I put that on the squad out here

[Verse 2:]
Why you think a nigga out here thuggin in his yesterdays
New money, some clothes on from yesterday
That’s crazy cause I know that little bitch yo
She got a couple babies with the big bro
Man that ho ain’t shit nigga, no
Tryna tell the homie but he can’t let the bitch go
So I’m out here thuggn in my yesterdays
New money, same clothes on from yesterday
So I’m out here thuggn in my yesterdays
New money, same clothes on from yesterday
That’s right my boy, I hope he get that straight
What yo boy waiting for, I’m tryna make this plate
What you saying nigga, that my niggas is waiting
Plus I ain’t smoked no weed yet so I’m getting impatient
Well I can dip and come back –
Nah, nah, no! I ain’t trying to cancel it
Keep calling, big bro that nigga ain’t answering
Wait big bro? Yeah the same nigga that we talking about
He had a dumb look on his face when he was walking out though
(There was a nigga in your motherfucking house
There was a nigga leaving your house
I just seen a nigga pull off bitch [x2]
Ya’ll fucking babies in here
You don’t tell me that here tonight)
I’m a bust a move (why)
Hungry as fuck, I’m a get some food
Thinking in my head he gon’ come back
With something to prove
Aight just pause G
He just checking you back, man he on his way
I ain’t really tryna put this shit off another day
I know the rules all money, ain’t good money
But this money right here so good for me
Yeah I just pray these niggas like mind
Fuck I gotta make a move, the clock’s winding

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
(In front of my kids man?
In front of my kids?
The end. Sleep tight kids.)
