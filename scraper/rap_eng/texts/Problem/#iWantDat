[Verse 1: Problem]
Chachi your own 10, chachi your own 10
20/20 for the money, bruh we locked in
Circle full of baddies got me boxed in
Coupe lettin' loose, who boo wanna hop in?
Roll with a winner one time though
Make that ass clap then bring it back 'fore the encore
Ain't about money, or fuckin' and it's no time for the convo
Chaci-Alejandro, lucky blanco, squad!
Diamond Lane everything, yeah
Make yo' women just say, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now put yo' hands in the air
And repeat everything after here

[Hook]
Don't play cause I want you
You already know what we gon' do (you already know)
Drop low like a limbo
Let me see you do it for the whole crew
Cause I know you wanna get like me
If your girlfriends with it we can all be free
We be goin' up, in the club til 3
Is you rollin' wit me?

[Verse 2: Mike]
Posse on Sunset, but we look like Crenshaw
Got the club on all star
Baby want access, cause she know what the drink cost
She gon' grind on my lap til I lift off
Yeah cause I know you bout it
Money on the floor cause you know I got it
Real nigga ain't no doubt about it
You got a body like you work at Onyx

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl you know what it is
You can roll with a boss
Have the time of your life
I ain't tellin' no lies
You ain't gotta be shy (cause I want dat)

[Chorus x2]
I know exactly what you like
You don't have to blow my high
Whatever's on your mind
Can we do it right now cause I want dat

[Hook]
Don't play cause I want you

[Verse 3: EJ]
Yeah she know I got paper

Then I'm like yeah, yeah
Won't you put it in the air

Yeah, cause I know you bout it, aye
Money on the floor cause you know I got it, aye
Real nigga, ain't no doubt about it, aye

[Verse 4: Bad Lucc]
Hold on baby,  moving lil fast gon' and slow down baby
Nah I'm just playin' never slow down
Got enough D for the go round
Bottles bring more rounds
Bad Lucc up in the club, me and my squad
Look at me now, daddy on fire
The mission to getting all of the paper in my lock
MB, c'est la vie they so fly

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl you know what it is
You can roll with a boss
Have the time of your life

You ain't gotta be shy (cause I want dat)

[Chorus x2]

Whatever's on your mind
