[Verse 1]
Hol' up, I got somethin' to say
Wouldn't none of this shit be goin' without Dre
But I'm the one to put his own records out
Without signing to a nigga from the east or the south
Back with that bounce, the bullshit, the bull pit lit
Killin' Cali, we're out here, where wolves get bit
Ask around, bruh I'm kinda important
Me and Game takin' shots with Khloe and Kourtney
Y'all ain't there cause y'all keep too many niggas around you
Gotta watch that shit, your own niggas'll down you
Yeah, left dead while your niggas surround you
With a unshot pistol that you bought for 'em
My car Nipsey Hussle with a hot lauren
New new, I see your new nigga, ex girl, boo boo
No toilet seat, ignorin' beef these days
Let's talk this ball and Kenny Smith, EJ

[Verse 2]
I was mobbin' through the club
Me and Nick off drugs
Seen a rapper that don't like me
Still he reach to give me hugs
Type of fuck shit is that?
Man I swear you niggas coochie
Harty at you niggas hoochie
Man, them bandanas don't fool me
Save that thuggin' for your mama
She the only one believe you
Can't keep hidin' behind them lies
Bruh, I see you when I see you
I got the money, I got the money
Dollar ain't shit, we set the bar
If you got the money, you got the money
Then why you drivin' that nigga's car?
Yeah, why you wearin' that nigga's chain?
Why you fame made off that nigga's name?
Cause as soon as he don't want you to hang
You gon' be back suckin' my dick again

[Verse 3]
I got the proof
I can make that pretty pussy shoot
Like the thang aimin' at a hoop
Baby, I'm the coach
Rich nigga smokin' 'til the roach
Carbon bitches, y'all scared to approach
I can admit, I'm quite intimidatin'
I oversee your position, that's quite  an understatement
Got 8 plus on these niggas so when I war
So tap it louder than that nigga that Kylie Jenner dated
What, bet ya'll niggas gon' say that's a diss
Text comin', yo Prob, I reply, who this
Them 3 dots pop up and then they go away
Guess they upset the young king ain't got they number saved

[Verse 4]
Man, these niggas emotional as my son's mother
Just like her they upset cause I don't love her
All I need is Nick, Luck, Bird, Louie and Fat
Weez, DOG, Preez, we put the crew on the map
Yeah, go at that, I react like a zombie
The marijuana helpin' calm in, the demon inside me
Still remember when I didn't have a pot to piss in
When I was doin' it for the love and not the recognition
My buzz died and niggas couldn't get one favor
Now I got the juice, and it just made out the fruits to my labor
What, go ahead, pussies have assist
Yeah I forgive but best believe I will never forget
Me and Wiz playin' pool, walkin' in like we brothers
Overlookin' the city, knowin' no one's above us
Game tradin', posse livin', that's what we be on
Laughin' laughin' cause he check the boy for havin' Yeezys on
It's Sunday, Chaci might as well take him to church
Writin' on my second story like I just finished the first
Diamond lane, come celebrate this lithuation
Got with Quik and it solidify my situation
Cause y'all don't believe in greatness until the masses say it
Or until the Master say it

[Verse 5]
On and off the court, shit
Mid 30's and I'm lookin' like I'm 25
Don't put me in no combo with them lil niggas
Cause everythin' look real 'til the real arrive
They see us, get nervous, their bodies start twitchin'
Then behind our back, tell our business to bitches
And business to niggas that ain't got no business
In my business, for that is no no forgiveness
And they know I'm with the shit, that's why they don't try me
Cause I done turn it up on everybody
What, nigga west to the east, east, east
Only thing I turn down was a street
What, put it in her deep, baby skeet when I squeeze a cheek
Faithful as a preach, on G, man she had to cheat
Yeah, like she ain't study for a test
Problem, most underrated out the west
That's the word, who had you niggas swallowin' pills?
They try to keep me out the loop cause I ain't signin' no deal
Now 6 years later, yeah, I'm still right in they face
Who else in LA got a hit without a feature from Drake? I'll wait
