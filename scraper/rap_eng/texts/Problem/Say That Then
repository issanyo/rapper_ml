[Intro: Problem]
It's hard for a nigga to say what’s up
Straight up

[Verse 1: Problem]
What? I am CA: Diego, LA, to the Bay
Yeah, it’s my shit, my nigga
L Gang got this, my nigga
On lock, on wrap, whatever
I’m rich, come to smell my leather
Rich now, but I’m wearing whatever
Cheese burger, no beef come with cheddar
But I ain’t trippin', take it all in
Lick your girl clit, then she take it all in
Best kush filling my joints
Say I sound too L.A., that’s the point, nigga, what?

[Hook: Problem]
Nigga, you know where I’m from
You know what I represent
Nigga, you know where I’m from
You know what I represent
Got a problem? Say that then
Say that then, say that then (huh?)
Want a problem? Say that then
Say that then, say-say that then (what?)

[Verse 2: Problem]
Aye, where the bitches at?
Please keep me away from where the snitches at
‘Cause I ain’t tryna hear what you gon tell me
At least stay with one ho like I barely
Cash on the celly, ‘cause a nigga getting it
Rhyme and I’m pitchin' it, ain't shit different
Nigga, you sweet, you gon' need some insulin
Get him ‘cause I throw my rod deep like a fisherman
Lick her in the kitchen then fuck her on the floor though
Pop the nigga molly, rollin' like a 4 door
I ain’t going down, yeah, like your ho go
Getting this money, nigga, ball like a cholo

[Hook: Problem]
Nigga, you know where I’m from
You know what I represent
Nigga, you know where I’m from
You know what I represent
Got a problem? Say that then
Say that then, say that then (huh?)
Want a problem? Say that then
Say that then, say-say that then (what?)

[Verse 3: Glasses Malone]
I am CA: Sac town, Seaside,L.A
And, nigga, this my shit: Bad ass DM clique
Crew, gang, mobbin'
Say the wrong thing I'm poppin'
Ain’t noboby lining nothing up
Interference, we all fuck 'em up
Drink east side, no cuts, fuck a bandaid
Eating on some crumbs with the mayonnaise
I’m the man and all the hoes see that
Tell me pull up if a bitch nigga need that, on the set

[Hook: Problem]
Nigga, you know where I’m from
You know what I represent
Nigga, you know where I’m from
You know what I represent
Got a problem? Say that then
Say that then, say that then (huh?)
Want a problem? Say that then
Say that then, say-say that then (what?)
