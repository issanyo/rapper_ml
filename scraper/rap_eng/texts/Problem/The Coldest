Clack clack, dump on them lame niggas
True shit, my team running games nigga
Everyday I get fresh, I’m the coldest
All this ice, I’m the coldest
I’m the coldest nigga, I’m the coldest
Keep a bad ass bitch, I’m the coldest
I’m the coldest nigga, I’m the coldest
Nigga I don’t turn tricks, I’m the coldest
I used to wanna fuck Toni Braxton
Now all my hoes bad like I did a casting
Shit easy, they choosin, jump off
When it’s over, I’ll bring her to your front door
I’m different, I don’t do it like the last nigga
No plastic, I’m comin straight cashin
Keep the heat with me when I get the d way
Café type nigga that the streets made
Bending corners in a big wheel
6 figure whips, fuck how pigs feel
Look, bitch give me brain so I call her my tutor
Suck a dick slow so I’m fast like luthor
Pretty ass face, pussy soft like velvet
Told her don’t let them fuck free, we can sell it
I told her don’t let them fuck free, we can sell it

Clack clack, dump on them lame niggas

Everyday I get fresh, I’m the coldest
All this ice, I’m the coldest
I’m the coldest nigga, I’m the coldest
Keep a bad ass bitch, I’m the coldest
I’m the coldest nigga, I’m the coldest
Nigga I don’t turn tricks, I’m the coldest
Rims got big rocks like a boulder
Get her on the can she gonn squirt no soda
See me in the streets like salute I’m a soldier
Hit the lot and snatch up whips like towers
Grab her from the back yeah I hold her by the shoulders
Put it in her mouth then bust it on her molars
Chain hela big wear stupid like a 3 action
Your girl wanna fuck and I’ma let her, no ps
Huh, I’m that nigga, keep a lil goon for the combat nigga
Say you got bitches, where the dames at nigga
Last time I saw you, you was with a wombat nigga
Me and red pullin up in them big toys
Shut up, you can’t smart talk big boys
Blowing kush all day, got cotton mouth
Death to the fake nigga, know what I’m talkin bout?

I’m the coldest nigga, I’m the coldest
Nigga I don’t turn tricks, I’m the coldest
