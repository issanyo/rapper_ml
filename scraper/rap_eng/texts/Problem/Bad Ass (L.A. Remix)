[Hook: Kid Ink]
I'm feeling like a man of the hour, tear down the house
Throwin' this money like it's no running out
Okay, but I wanna know, can you get any higher?
And drop it down the pole like it's a fire
Now let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
Let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I'm feeling like the man of the hour, but give me a minute
I'll be the man of the year before the season is finish
I'm on the haunt for that ass Ciroc
Pool in your stomach
I hope you know how to swim
Before I drown you in money
Now girl I ain't even count it
Never really been into math
You got me going so broke, I think that I need a cash
Just throw it all in the air, and hit your face like the Mask
I got a couple freaky things I don't know if I can ask or not
Come over here and show me that you bad
Straight out detention no pretending I can see in your calves
You got the strength to hold it up and don't you ever collapse
So high I think I'm about to relapse

[Hook]

[Verse 2: YG]
I'm feeling like the man of the hour, that pussy got power
When she riked up with me we have make up sex in the shower
I got a white girlfriend she smoke like she a rasta
That pussy the lion king, hakuna matata
..........my gon' .shot when I say so
The hood house where I lay low
When a verse charge em like San Diego
I buy condoms by the case load
Ya'll fuck we pay for
And I can't stand stank hoes, I got bank rolls
Got your girl naked on table
They say more money, more problems
No more money, no problems
My girl buy so much designer, I call her miss finger powder
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water let that mother fucker burn

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Problem]
I'm feeling like the man with the power
Was once the man with the sour
Pushed it and moved it
Told ya'll I was the shit and I proved it
Any nigga in my way I'mma bruise it
Flow like a cruise ship, go go , no no nigga dont stop my shine
Boy I'm ballin' and that money callin' and
We all see that it ain't got your line
So come on, I'm about to do it
Sure got big shoe Patrick Ewings
But I'm known nigga got a big ass dick and
I fly all day like a long trip
We on one
Ain't broke but I'm yelling out pour one
Tryin' to get lit like a matchtop
Never po po can't cops ugh
Where the drinks at?
I'm trying to get where I think at
Raybans couple where I blink at
You won't never catch me in no pink hat
We dont do that, Diamond life
Everybody know my Squad
My Rolex just tapped in my shoulder and said
Oh boy you owe your ...
Problem yeah

[Outro: Kid Ink]
Now let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
Let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
