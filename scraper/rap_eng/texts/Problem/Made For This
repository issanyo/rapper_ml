[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
Same old shit just another day
Shit fucked up but I got to make a way
Can't be mad cause the haters gon' hate
I'm 'bout this cash so I'm trying to get paid
Same old shit just another day
Shit fucked up but I got to make a way
Can't be mad cause the haters gon' hate
I'm 'bout this cash so I'm trying to get paid

[Hook: August Alsina]
Nigga I'm made for this
Started from the bottom now I'm here
Because I'm made for this
Had to make them troubles disappear
Because I'm made for this
Used to call me nothing now I'm something
Because I'm made for this
Yeah that's right I'm made for this, made for this

[Verse 1: Problem]
The girls always open, I shop when it's closed
Middle fingers to the haters, while I'm popping the Rose
Don't function with fake, I'm too real for that
Lil nigga don't small talk me, don't you know I'm too big for that?
Thank God I'm alive, I thank God I'm alive
Straight shots to the head, my God I'm alive
Playa do your drugs, baby sip your drank
And keep doing it big in front of them niggas that told you you can't

Same old shit just another day
Shit fucked up but I got to make a way
Can't be mad cause the haters gon' hate
I'm 'bout this cash so I'm trying to get paid
Same old shit just another day
Shit fucked up but I got to make a way
Can't be mad cause the haters gon' hate
I'm 'bout this cash so I'm trying to get paid

Yeah that's right I'm made for this, made for this

[Verse 2: Problem]
Been thinking that the lil niggas showing something real that something that I ain't even finna do
Like a year and half ago I was one of them niggas niggas didn't want to listen to
Go year and half later I'm standing right here, haters holding my dick on 'em
Big body with the kid on 'em, stand fresh getting rich on 'em
Shots, thank God I'm alive, thank God I'm alive
Kush joints to the face, my God I'm alive
I made it out the ghetto check my background, carried more ratchets than a tool box
Nigga got to go and stack a few blocks, daddy 'bout to fill another shoe box

[Bridge: Problem & August Alsina]
Grind everyday gotta hustle
Hundred on me I ain't with fronting
There's always a nigga that ain't got shit
Just tryna tell a nigga how to get some
Grind everyday gotta hustle
Hundred on me I ain't with fronting
There's always a nigga that ain't got shit
Just tryna tell a nigga how to get some
