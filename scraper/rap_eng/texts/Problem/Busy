[Chorus: Problem]
Hunnid million in my sight, I gotta touch that
Go against the throne, you gettin' bust at (Bust at)
Hustlin’, yeah, I'm busy as a bee
And I ain't fuckin’ no bitch if she ain't busier than me
On my ma and my daddy, too
My kids, my auntie, and my granny, too

[Verse 1: Problem]
'Member polyin' with Boolie in my granny's eighty-two
School 'bout to start, mama, I ain't got no loot
What the fuck we finna do?
Fuck it, hit the mall, snatch somethin', rack somethin’
I’m smokin' dolo if you niggas ain’t tryna match somethin'
Yeah, mama always knew I was on the cash route
Forteen, holdin' dice games in my back house
Darn nea stayed two doors from the crack house
Dealers maxed out 'til they pockets racked out (Boom!)
Hmm, Chachi need to see what that ’bout
Damn, enemy just hit the block with the Macs out
Boom-boom-boom, shots rang out, duck for cover
R.I.P. Joaquin, they shot him dead in front his mother
Salute my nigga Nick, I ain't shit without my brother
I'm my mama's only son, because of him she got another
What

[Chorus: Problem]
Hunnid million in my site, I gotta touch that
Go against the throne, you gettin' bust at (Bust at)
Hustlin', yeah, I'm busy as a bee
And I ain't fuckin' no bitch if she ain't busier than me
On my ma and my daddy too
My kids, my auntie, and my granny too

[Verse 2: Problem]
Nigga had a second kid 'fore he turned twenty-two
I'm 'bout to have my third, what the fuck I'm finna do?
Chachi gotta bust a move
Hit the streets, I ain't eatin' like I'm 'sposed to
With this hustle and this talent, I shoulda been busted over
Couldn't stop until it over, man, I feel it gettin' closer (Uh)
Feel it gettin' closer, yeah, I feel it gettin' closer
Mama told me stop stressin' 'fore a nigga get a ulcer
Nothin' comin', pockets touchin', baby mom gon' make me choke her
Man, I'm lookin' like a bitch, like these niggas wearin' chokers
Supposed to be in Gucci loafers up in strokers, throwin' loafers, what
I ain't but I finna be
That methamphetamine got me with a whole 'nother energy
I want it all, literally
I just drop drugs in my Hennessy
Ain't carin' 'bout the penalty

[Chorus: Problem]
Get a hunnid million in my site, I gotta touch that
Go against the throne, you gettin' bust at (Bust at)
Hustlin', yeah, I'm busy as a bee
And I ain't fuckin' no bitch if she ain't busier than me
On my mama and my daddy too
My kids, my auntie, and my granny too

[Bridge: Problem]
Nigga seen his first million 'fore he turned thirty-two
Lost that, bounced back like a real nigga do
On my mama though, what

[Interlude: Problem]
Yeah, to be continued, uhh
We gon keep that like that, I'm cool with that

[Break: Rucci]
What, ayy
What, uh oh
Cypress
Ayy, okay

[Verse #: Rucci]
I dropped outta school, eleventh grade, I said fuck it (Fuck it)
Livin' life backwards (Damn), Benjamin Button
All of a sudden niggas be stuck countin' big money (Ayy)
Catch they ass in public and tell they ass to run it
It's the big dawg, famous, why I don't need no friends (What)
Ridin' by my lonely with my forty in my Benz (Ayy)
Try me if you want to, promise that's gon' be the end of your life
Wanna gamble with it? Nigga, roll the dice
My mama pray for me, I mix Henny with my Molly
Where I'm from (Ayy), North Side (Ayy), catch a body, now you poppin' (Ayy)
I ain't stoppin', I ain't droppin', bitches flockin', nigga's jockin'
I told Problem if he got a problem, Rucci got a chopper (B-r-r-r-ap!)
Keep it solid like my mo'fuckin' father (Big time)
Pull out this big bitch and sing like a opera (North)
Losin' ain't a option (What)
I told my niggas I got us
I do this shit with no effort, I'm poppin'
