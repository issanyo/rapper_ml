[Verse 2:]
Just made some money, about to fire up the reef
Gone like Minefa, bitch gayer than Latifa
Everything is paper, twenty five for the feature
All my dope killing twenty five for the evening
Draws full of joint and DVD’s
Use my act as EBT
Scope your bitch and make a movie
Going on a DVD
Couples on a payroll
So we moving easily
Been a winner from the start
Do a six on TBT
Back to seven Sundays
Ask the revent just to crack ten dime show
Bout to mack eleven
Pop, pop, pop
Pop it hanging low
Make a million cash
Did drop it on the floor
Oh my

[Chorus:]
Just made some money,bout to fire up the reef
Gone like Minefa, bitch gayer than Latifa
Everything is paper, twenty five for the feature
All my dope killing twenty five for the evening
Roll another joint get high with my nigga

But these niggas in the wait
And everyday I pray that I see another day

Tiny Pants in the building
Ain’t touching no work
I’m good there cause I’m the man oh
Gang, gang you real and we the same thing
Ain’t switching up or changing up we in the same lane

Still tugging with my partners
My niggas ain’t with the drama
Press the button and we be mobbin
I told her twist em jay
So we can pass away the problem
I told her hold them cups
Cause we be drinking out the bottles
They don’t even want us up in here
We cut the line

Roll the blunts and watch us smoke em in here
Presidential Kush nigga like they voted in here
Twisting fingers so they know we in here

Need my cousin bone track new hit the streets with a rush
I need that magical bank
And niggas out of line

I got my family on my mind
Nigga smoking this weed

[Chorus]
