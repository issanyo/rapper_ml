[Chorus:]
(Just be yourself)
Trying to make a million on rap and no cake
Boy came up and nigga checking no fake
If you open that package every  second all day
Whole world no play, No sleep, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way [x4]

[Verse 1:]
Start getting money, are you crazy
Cornerstar, so you say
A sad note to my side line, know your place
Quit the shoot, cause I got all, count your ways
Brought your best new boosts, no way
Fell in love with smute, no way
Got your pick and loose, four ways ok
Don’t play, go soft, no way
Four days I have been on no sleep, ok
Don’t try and keep it on me
Taking  break, I got cheese on the whey
Throw me the key to the safe
Cause am

[Chorus:]
Trying to make a million on rap and no cake
Boy came up and nigga checking no fake
If you open that package every  second all day
Whole world no play, No sleep, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way [x4]

[Verse 2:]
What! No way
Quick the dip in for my chips
No free, no lace
Stay bent like your bitch if she live with me
Squad with the bullshit, like they were born in May
What? You full of toys with a cracker boys in it from the side eye
Baller too hard to hit eight from the sideline
Every time I look at my clock it saying grind time
Molly got my mind fired, bill it like a nine five
Rally this mother fuck, What?
Rally this mother fuck, yeah
My niggas make it rain, we’ll drown the mother fuck man
Ringing like a dial tone, swagger on the dial zone
Pussy hurricane and blowing home

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
If am hurting nigga i'm feeling no effect baby (ok)
Even all of the money in the world don't make sense baby (no)
He left your girl with me, so now your bitch taken
I got you in all these picture, making all these faces, smiling crazy
Brought your best new boosts, no way
Fell in love with smute, no way
I’m riding it cool, for days, those  days
Drop tops, so they say I’m straight (I'm straight)
Rap...rapping paid off fool
Ain't paying off no day
Am praying and praying it’s coming from my soul
So I state this hill as my goal

[Chorus]
