(Diamond Lane)
Talk my shit
Talk my shit
I'm about to talk my shit

All is tough nigga talk got me hot ass summer
Quick the call and nigga bluff like he got a number
Is the boy wonder, boy wonder what them days gone
Just go out to them few nigga that I changed on
At least that's what I heard in the hood
Mad, cause I'd rather be in the burbs than the hood
Hey rather me on the block bro smoking with the have nuts
I was in the ..because I excel and they have not
Buggin some shit be bigger than it's seem
Imagine livin banking on your dreams
It's a nightmare born the line to sanity
Now I'm waking up, for that dream is my reality
Man I got these haters mad at me
Shit, I love that these haters mad at me
I love that these haters mad at me
I said that I love that these haters mad at me
Fuck it, let me talk my shit
Huh, let me talk my shit
Fuck it I'm gone, let me talk my shit
Fuck em, them niggas want that shit is bad as me
While I'm balling with a hood
But even in that everything ain't no good listen
Last shit I gotta let it in the mirror
Let it say I got a two year girl
What the fuck I'm gonna tell my ladies
How the hell I'm gonna explain this to my other babies
No lie, hard true cause real shit
And this song will the first time they hear this
So hard pure the swallow ain't it
So let me ash the stash it ain't gonna be swallow ain't it
At least I hope
Pop top on the rock won't ever zip a dope
And let me talk my shit and let me talk my shit
I'ma let you talk my shit, fuck it
Folk it will be rocky as long as the fucking flow
I'm good that's all the prayers got
I swear that's them saying Joe
Cause you my outcome what it been wait different
I can't ..is had me listen and loud create to come a..
As make me cocky, sayin with no re-feel the consequences got me
To wonder held up in the mirror, the mirror
And I know instantly it's not me at all
Lost it all
To every bitch help me back to every dollar that I have
To that home that I own
To some niggas from my croop best take a body
Busters in the March left too, chain
I wouldn't change that spirit for the world
I swear I learned a lot of shit
But I back no front nigga
I cash that will be a sally bitch
Let me talk my shit, nigga let me talk my shit
Fuck it I'm own, let me talk my shit
Fuck it
I'm school in these niggas who wanna scholarship
..doing this thing, right, right?
Fuck it, roll up, nigga I gotta fly in this
I'm a better man now, want a proof
A text blast can take a squat in this choose roll
Just one, nigga that easy
A content in double UA I'm that easy
In the statch show that the game needs
In this hell yeah I need the game
Our niggas better get the picture quick
For a nigga had to freeze your frame
This song need the name cause I ain't have one yet
I hear niggas with that gun talk
Huh, but I ain't seen one yet
Don't think that I ain't looking
Because I'm getting money staying fresh and ducking pussy
On the daily yeah that's all I'm doing bro
Shout out to the squat and them niggas that I do it for
Diamond lane, diamond lane, change the game we bout to do
Niggas stars, we them stars that's the stars we're looking to
Get out with my mama she'll be like damn look at you
Life's a bitch you took the bitch and work it like a pimp of..
You pop her like a pimp of two
Poppin like a ..I know you're shining
But can you slow down the mollies though
Let me talk my shit
I'm high let me talk about this
Can't you see that I'm own
