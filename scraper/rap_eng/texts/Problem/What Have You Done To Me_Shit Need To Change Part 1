[Intro]
Baby what have you done to me

[Pre-Hook]
I can’t walk down the street without you on my mind

[Verse 1]
Babe you got a nigga mind blown
Come on let me do you with the lights on
Yeah I need to see you up baby
It’s always hard for me to leave my baby
Cause you be doing shit that some other girls don’t
Put up with some shit that some other girls won’t
And tolerate the ache that come from that shit
Lady in the streets but in the bed you still ratchet

[Hook]
I can’t walk down the street without you on my mind
My mind my mind my mind

[Verse 2]
You ain’t nothing like I'm used to
You put a spell on me girl you know voodoo
You got me going cookie for the coocoo
And she love to give me head for the grateful
Got me thinking bout her backing out the driveway
This ain't no ordinary love I'm a side A
I go to war too venir for my baby
I go to war too venir for my baby
My homie hit me on my line said he need a square
Sent that nigga to the trap cause my son he there
I hit my baby up and said he finna get a pack
She said it’s all good but daddy when you coming back

[Hook]
I can’t walk down the street without you on my mind
My mind my mind my mind
I can’t walk down the street without you on my mind
My mind my mind
What have you done What have you done
What have you done What have you done to me

[Verse 2]
Off hennessy and ginger ale though
Me and slick smoking in my 2010 marro
Down San Pedro crossing over the rail road
Last baby mommy got my mind on hell mode
Why everybody tryna piss off the real one
Hit the plug for a nut put some drugs in my system
Man shit need to change shit need to change
Pinch assign them machines trying to get the change
Hot as fuck outside but it finna rain though
Copped John after that like a fucking rain but my lil bitch like bitches
You’d have fucked a rainbow
Hopped out the car on the morgue like who wanna tango
What! shit need to change shit need to change
Shit need to change shit need to change
Living up the fruits of my luck
Why I don’t be up in the hood shit boring as fuck
Cops tripping over nothing should have known it as fuck
And all the bodies over here I done already fucked
Yeah I done already fucked
Got a baby by tour I'm already fucked
Shit need to change shit need to change
Shit need to change shit need to change
Shit just ain’t what it used to be
Bro I ain’t as young as I used to be
So that mean I ain’t as dumb as I used to be
Never hung with rappers where the plug where I used to be
Racking with the rackers courtsiding with the jogges
I just nina with the package having dinner with the crackheads
Blowing down a couple grams and then take my son to practice
Mother fuckers never touch me cause they know the boy
Fact they ever knew if [?]
Repercussions after that don’t ask me bout no niggas
Yeah yeah clears mirrors I'm just checking my fresh
You’re now tuned in to the best of the best
Yeah the best of the west easy
Rain Dre and ice cube yell out my name
Problem problem
Now yell out my game
If you don’t
Shit need to change shit need to change
Shit need to change shit need to change
Shit need to change shit need to change
Shit need to change shit need to change

I'm back to just doing what I want
It’s just getting crazy
