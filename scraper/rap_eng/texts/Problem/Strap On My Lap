[Chorus :]
Strap on my lap
Keep my strap on my lap
Strap on my lap
Got my strap on my lap
Strap, strap on my lap
Keep my strap on my lap
Strap on my lap
Got my, got my strap on my lap

[Verse 1:]
I’m Packer
Better defence than the fucking linebacker
Defended by my offense differences
I’m a trapper, they so at this
I get money, why they booed us
Why they mad, fuck it!
Imma make them madder
You won’t even matter
You're a fucking non-factor
Real as they come, one of one
And they come in four, and they come after
(Hell you cross me) That’s the end of your chapter
Fucks your bitch, glad, now she say I hit her better
Take your shoes off in my house, before this el packer
You can have her, I’d a have her
Get that out in my home,I pitch it better
Back to the subject of the matter
Nigga sharper than a dagger
Add more double to my swagger
Add more, and more to my yap
Add more cash, more meals on my platter
Bitch Imma add her, still I subtract
Pussy nigga hate you when you climbing up the ladder
Worry bout me, nigga I fuck them running laps
Catch you with your pen now, hit you with the spat
All them fucking lil rat shit
Whips in stack
Fill it with the shine, they say where you meet this gal
Top drop, gal strap
For the strap, but I keep it in my lap
Kiss a nigga...echo
I got something to make him back up

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Hey, your pussy ain’t got me strap
I’m toss chicken heads in some bounce
Like a fucker on the phone
Nigga I know you hear the tap
You wear red nigga, so can't fuck around, get a hole in your head
Should have hold it, go flipping and no flap
This is trap not a game
Cause tissue won’t dead
My life nigga ain’t for this hand on me yet
That’s a mother fucking fact
(Never will) Fuck around get wet
Take hands off your feet
Role by myself, still a nigga hallow deep
Hands off, punch 10
Make some extra tens
Ain’t gonna miss a fucking beat
Nigga, nigga take a nap
Me, Imma wrapping up these raps
Yeah, I let you niggas do that wrap
Me, I push them buttons like a app
Yeah, then them pussy niggas laughing so they snitched or snap
Yeah, have them niggas running laps
Clap on, clap off like the clap
All my men in black, my niggas tell me where it's at
Wordplay key, niggas slow they can’t catch
Curve ball key, I’m the pitcher they’d a catch
One shot, one kill
Nigga no rematch
Nigga still ratch
I wonder where the wretch

[Chorus ]
