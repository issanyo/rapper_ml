Betta watch yo self
Betta watch yo self
What
What
(Laugh)
Aww shit

[Verse 1]
All you niggas swear you with the fuck shit
Til it's time to get buck
A lot of talk, no nuts
See that ain't how I was raised
Send packs, catch fades
Stay on the move or catch strays
Forever on the go
Money get low it's ewoohoo
Bro I ain't afraid of that
Cause if I made mill one time
It's no question I can make it back
That's on the gang
Broady what up
We drunk laughin at the niggas we cut
And how they out here politic'in
But ain't nobody but they momma listening
That's on the gang
It's hot out here
Seem like everybody gettin shot out here
Ex bitch stalking my post
So what you lookin for a shout out here
Get lost
They love my sauce
The way I say R they love my talk
California reppin, Lords my weapon
Never count my money fore' I count my blessings
Just made a left on Western
Got a green chili from Ramonas tho
See a mark nigga out my side eye
He think I ain't tripping but I'm on him doe
Dern Avenue with an attitude
In these magazines fully magazined
Mind full of weed, I don't fuck with lean
But I'm far from a preacher nigga do ya thing
It's hot here
Girl you thought we didn't know you was a bop out here
Whaat
Giving niggas top, setting up plots to have niggas run up in my house out here
Ewoohoo

[Hook]
Betta watch yo self
Betta watch yo self
Hoe I ain't Playin

Betta watch yo self
Betta watch yo self
Ewoohoo

Betta watch yo self
Betta watch yo self
Bruh I ain't playin

Betta watch yo self
Betta watch yo self
Ewoohoo

Ewoohoo

[Verse 2]
Have these bitches looking for a life line
Money never caught up in the pipelines
Every time I left it was the right time
Hero to the hood but I don't fight crime
If it don't make money i don't make time
If it don't make money i don't make time
You can stay broke ima make mine
If I spend 3 imma make 9
If I spend 9 imma make 27
Comptown raised from the Deuce to the Nellas
Got a gang of hoes and don't front for no fellas
KD fucked my ex in the Fronts I was jealous
Had a baby in her I admit I was careless
Student of the game I was schooled by the felons
Learned from every lost and ain't no tellin
Now a days everybody tellin
So

[Hook 2]
Betta watch yo self
Betta watch yo self
Hoe I ain't Playin

Betta watch yo self
Betta watch yo self
Ewoohoo

Betta watch yo self
Betta watch yo self
Bruh I ain't playin

Betta watch yo self
Betta watch yo self
Ewoohoo

Ewoohoo

Ewoohoo
