Smokin', drinkin'

I've been smokin', I've been drinkin'
I don't know what I was thinkin'
I've been high all weekend
Drunk as fuck but still tweakin'
So high I can't hear nobody
I can't even feel my body
Gon' need a paramedic prolly
She off that cookie and a molly
This remind me of that mafia
Gettin' bread now I'm popular
If you hatin' keep it on the d-low
Gotta shout out to my youngin' P-Lo
In the club, and we smokin' pre-rolleds
Want me in your club need a couple zeros
Bands will make us hold up, plans, roll up all them grams
In my new car, in my new car
See my new chain, say I went too far
See my watch facing, yeah that's too hard
What I put gold in my tooth for
I did it just to match my pinky
And prolly so these fuck niggas can see me while I'm

Smokin', drinkin'

I've been smoking, I've been drinking
I don't know what I was thinkin'
I've been high all weekend
Drunk as fuck but still tweakin'
Damn bro I'm fucking fried
Say you high as me liar
Weed so strong it make you cough
Teeth grindin', rollin' heavy, tryna shake it off
Sucka shit is hella corny
Molly got me hella horny
Fuck it let these bands play
Bet the bitch do what these bands say
Damn there goes your baby momma
Looking like she wanna Problem
Fuck it I'mma give her some
You never let her out so I'mma make her cum
All over this damn place
Poppa poppin' like champagne
Poppa poppin' like drive-bys
You can't connect to my wi-fi
I'm sky high, look at me
Man fuck these niggas, lemme get back to

Smokin', drinkin'
