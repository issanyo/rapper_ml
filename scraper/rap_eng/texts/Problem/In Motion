[Hook : T.I]
All we do it ride, swang, bounce and turn
Ballin' from the spot with an ounce of burn
We in motion, we in motion
We in motion, we in motion
All we do it ride, swang, bounce and turn
Ballin' from the spot with an ounce of burn
We in motion, we in motion
We in motion, we in motion

[Chorus : T.I & Problem]
Where all the hoe lil niggas (they ain't near me)
Bet your lookin' for them pussy nigga (they ain't here)
Where all the hoe lil niggas (they ain't near me)
Bet your lookin' for them pussy nigga (they ain't here)
Hold up! nigga back up let me do my stuff
Strapped to the teeth, nigga who want what?
Hold up! nigga back up let me do my stuff
Strapped to the teeth, nigga who want what?


[Verse 1 : Problem]
Young Rida outta Compton, these bitches go crave by
Be the nigga off of pill, you'll probly get 8'ed off
Australia to Atlanta, they yellin' my gang up
Money ain't a thang, aye, we pullin' the thang out
Police on chase but they never ever catch me
Stood near the game, did nigga try to test me
[?] your money never ride like a leftie
You bring a bag of money, betta make that shit hefty


[Hook : T.I]
[Chorus : T.I & Problem]


[Verse 2 : T.I]
And we be rollin' 'em fatand burnin' it down
The shit that I'm blowin' like 5 thousand a pound
Associated with gangstas, so we don't fuck with them clowns
I got your bitch in the panties, won't mind pullin' 'em down
Oh, oh, eh, know you hate that
I put it in her face and make her take that
Goddamn, bitch hate that
I bust a nut, I roll a blunt and run it straight back


[Hook : T.I]
[Chorus : T.I & Problem]


[Verse 3 : Problem]

Got me in the A, high as fuck, hella turnt out
D Lane Hustle Gang, niggas gettin' riches
Now I'm tryna fuck, so Wassup with these bitches

[Verse 4 : T.I]
Play around if you want to
Shawty, you don't wanna see me pull up on you
Still ridin' with a Pistol, and a Ski mask
Westside know me niggas ... speedpass
