[Chorus]
Oh my Lord, my mind is gone
I done drank too much Patron
I don't think I'll make it home
Bartender (give me another one)
I just smoked a eighth of weed
And I popped the thizz
I drank all the drank
Man, you know what it is
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm fucked up (and I don't give a fuck)

[Verse 1]
And I won't never ever will, G
I'ma stay [?] loaded till it kills me
Real alcoholics and the weedheads feel me
Get drunker than a skunk, stay higher than the ceiling
I ain't trying to be disrespectful
But I just wanna fuck, no, nothing extra
The girl I would [?], ask Salt n Pepa
You never had sex with a star, I bet ya
So if you come back to the car I'll let ya
You're good on top my beef like ketchup
Huh, your boy just stepped up
Drunk that, smoked that, the boy here effed up

[Chorus]
Oh my Lord, my mind is gone
I done drank too much Patron
I don't think I'll make it home
Bartender (give me another one)
I just smoked a eighth of weed
And I popped the thizz
I drank all the drank
Man, you know what it is
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm fucked up (and I don't give a fuck)

[Bridge]
I'm high out my mind and I know I'm the shit
In the middle of the dance floor holding my dick
And I ain't trippin', ain't lookin' for drama
Tryin to find a new baby's mama
And if I can't find that
I'll settle for a rat (where they at?)

[Verse 2]
Hell yeah that's what I be 'bout
Wanna find a rat homie pull that cheese out
And then they'll ease out, but boy I'm through
Eyes beat off red, the drinks see out blue
Adios motherfuckers, which means I'm gone
Come and toast motherfuckers like I just came home
Or I just got on or whatever the case
Nigga ordered a case or brought whatever the waste
Baretta on waist, I might level the place
Nope that there be a hell of a case
And I ain't tryna do that, I'm too busy stumblin'
Mouth all dry and my stomach keep grumblin'

[Chorus]
Oh my Lord, my mind is gone
I done drank too much Patron
I don't think I'll make it home
Bartender (give me another one)
I just smoked a eighth of weed
And I popped the thizz
I drank all the drank
Man, you know what it is
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm fucked up (and I don't give a fuck)
