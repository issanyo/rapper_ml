[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Problem]
Up in this bitch and we all faded
Fuck 'bout a bitch, no we don't save her
Nothin' to a boss, do my own thing
It's money over hoes, no I'm no stranger
Want more bounce, we got more ounces
Want more bounce, we got more ounces
Want more bounce, we got more ounces
Want more bounce, we got more ounces
Gin and drugs, gin and drugs
Gin and drugs, we got gin and drugs
Gin and drugs, gin and drugs
Gin and drugs, we got gin and drugs
We got

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Only on Gin and them drugs, I walked in, in the club
About three of them, dawg I'm not kiddin'
When I tell you if you came with your bitch
Then it's the end of my car, push-start the engine
Let's start from the beginning
With a young nigga from the 'Burgh
Smokin' weed, gettin' money, fuck what you heard
Know they hate 'cause I'm flyer than I ever been
High off a medicine
Bitch bad, her ass fat, I'll probably let her in
Ball so fuckin' hard I need a letterman
Know a couple niggas that I'm better than
Pussy, I don't sweat it or the money 'cause I get it
Taylor Gang on top, just remember that I said it
Fuck this nigga bitch, grab my shit, then I jetted

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Problem]
Up in this bitch and we all faded
Fuck 'bout a bitch, no we don't save her
Nothin' to a boss, do my own thing
It's money over hoes, no I'm no stranger
Want more bounce, we got more ounces
Want more bounce, we got more ounces
Want more bounce, we got more ounces
Want more bounce, we got more ounces
Gin and drugs, gin and drugs
Gin and drugs, we got gin and drugs
Gin and drugs, gin and drugs
Gin and drugs, we got gin and drugs
We got!

[Verse 2: Problem]
Baby it's fuck day, who wanna bang?
Even though I had some, right 'fore I came
It's lit though!
Girl you ain't fuckin' what you here for?
Got at least 3 zips rolled, all ready
Wiz brought another jar with him
Gin and drugs got me feelin' like a car hit him
'Round 6 a.m once I hit my DM
Didn't have a rubber so she got to feel this skin
Money stacks stack high, bruh this don't bend
What's up with your friend? Biatch!
Ho, yeah-yeah-yeah
Feeling like Mitch when the light hit him
Married to the money, let the rice hit him

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Problem]
Up in this bitch and we all faded
Fuck 'bout a bitch, no we don't save her
Nothin' to a boss, do my own thing
It's money over hoes, no I'm no stranger
Want more bounce, we got more ounces
Want more bounce, we got more ounces
Want more bounce, we got more ounces
Want more bounce, we got more ounces
Gin and drugs, gin and drugs
Gin and drugs, we got gin and drugs
Gin and drugs, gin and drugs
Gin and drugs, we got gin and drugs
We got!
