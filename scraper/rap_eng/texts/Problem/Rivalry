[Verse 1: Tinashe]
Na na na, could be lookin' legendary
Datin' these models, we be doin' what we want
Damn, them niggas step in 'em, rivalry
They be like, your girl is on, on me
And I say, oh, oh, oh, oh
You can't fuck with me
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Will you let it go?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'ma let you know
Oh, I'm steady
I'm involved
They should let you know
Just a healthy dose
It's a competition
Hope you know
Yeah, you better take notes from a nigga like

[Chorus: Tinashe]
It's looking like a rivalry, rivalry
It's looking like a rivalry, rivalry
It's looking like a rivalry
You can't fuck, can't fuck, can't fuck with me
It's looking like a rivalry, rivalry
It's looking like a rivalry, rivalry
It's looking like a rivalry
You can't fuck, can't fuck, can't fuck with me

[Verse 2: Problem]
Fuck hoes, get money
Wrist stay cold so the stash stay sunny
Niggas stay mad 'cause I bashed they honey
Magnetic grind, cash can't stay from me
Summertime, hoe, now it's time to pull the cars out
20 whips at the front, homie, tip me all out
Small bread dead, only in it for the large count
Call a nigga bitch, tell him meet me at the yard house
We ain't lucky, oh, bad boys
He's Biggie, I'm Puff, he calls
Hit why with the time with the puffy on
It's ride time like a bike, get my puffy on, we with it
Lookin' for the bitches that's down to spend the night
Spend the night, yeah
It's Saturday so tomorrow, we can get it right
Get it right, what?

[Chorus: Tinashe]
It's looking like a rivalry, rivalry
It's looking like a rivalry, rivalry
It's looking like a rivalry
You can't fuck, can't fuck, can't fuck with me
It's looking like a rivalry, rivalry
It's looking like a rivalry, rivalry
It's looking like a rivalry
You can't fuck, can't fuck, can't fuck with me

[Bridge: Tinashe]
We ain't monkey, boy, but you turn flex
Couldn't even pull a bitch with your Rolex
Sip somethin', pu-puff another one
Let your level get a buzz 'cause you trippin', let's be honest
We ain't monkey, boy, but you turn flex
Couldn't even pull a bitch with your Rolex
Sip somethin', pu-puff another one
Let your level get a buzz 'cause you trippin', let's be honest

[Chorus: Tinashe]
You can't fuck, can't fuck, can't fuck with me
It's looking like a rivalry, rivalry
It's looking like a rivalry, rivalry
It's looking like a rivalry
You can't fuck, can't fuck, can't fuck with me
