[Chorus:]
The way the track, how it rolling, I need a grammy [x2]
No suite and tie, could be impress
(Hustle on the sweet green) the green gas
The way the track, how it rolling, I need a grammy
The way the track, how it rolling

[Verse 1:]
I’m a nigga round table suites
Cooking up, yeah we got truce
Straight salute, pistol on and now it going shoot
New cool, mooney ain’t nothing, your bitch ain’t nothing
She know that I’m stunting
I cook her the blow, you know I ain’t bluffing
I’m taking your ho and you know I ain’t cuffing
Yeah and if it ain’t gonna be no
Then fuck your discussion
Get the bricks, split the bricks, banana split
Banana clips, don’t trip, empty the whole clip
At your lip, at your hip and back to the trap house
The way it rolling, I need me a grammy
I bet I won’t miss out
On the block, lurking for customers
I bet I won’t miss out
In and out, in and out
Get him in, get him out, I need me a grammy

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Had a couple ground, had to get them all
Had a couple of people fainting at the mall
Got to get a grammy, trev, trevisol
Tribbing doll
On the street bow serve, all the dope serve
Then we gonna hit the mall
Got a couple brick stashing behind “ T” house in the wall
Gotta get a grammy
Gotta, gotta get a grammy
Came up nigga serving zoom zoom zowams
MT talking about money i'm spending
All around the globe
International trip
And I got the bitches on the plane with the brick shit
International flip
Gotta get the grammy
Just to stand free nigga gonna remember me nigga
And I gotta plug up tennessee nigga
For a ton a key nigga
And I got a mother fucking plane
Come and get at least ten a week nigga
If a nigga say they wanna eat raw meat, then a nigga must bring a guess

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
What y’all know bout spot living
Slang your sacks, extra straps in a bag hidden
Hold hoes on the couch smoking, dice game going on in the back kitchen
Real short and i’m back tripping
Lights off, we out fishing
Explored in the expedition
Bossing up for the best position
Suited and booted, hotter than shoes
I was recruited
Loud in this room
Bringing rose on them nice
I am the coolest, what?
Long way from them Ramen noodles
Wrong move will get your noodle ramen
Going hard all on that gram, my IG got the coolest comments
Head bust for that shot vowed
Got hands and I out style you
Same clothes for three days
This can only go three ways
I win, I win,  I win
Losing ain’t optional
I’m either gonna end up on the mother fucking Forbes
Or I’m sending somebody to the hospital

[Chorus]
