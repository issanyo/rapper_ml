All right so Problem, what exactly is 354?

[Problem]
Well in layman's terms, 354 is a telenumeric way to say DLG
Stands for Diamond Lane Gang, but to me it's bigger than that
354 is a representation on how us men carry ourselves
The way we walk, talk, dress, make sure one is doing better
Don't, don't shit on a man when he down, nah
The 354 way is to don't, don't come with no complaints
You, you uplift your man, you make your mans is up
You make sure you man is fresh
If your boy got a boo boo shoe on, you know what?
"Ay man, take that boo boo shoe off," better us than them
It's about getting us right, and then taking that and serving it out to the world
354 is bigger than any music group you've ever been a part of
â€˜Cause you know what? It ain't no fucking music group
It's a way of life
That's what DLG is and that's what 354 is
So when you say 354, it's bigger than a numeric thing
It's bigger than a cliche way to say "my gang," you feel me?
Fuck dying for this, we represent the niggas that live for this
You feel me? I mean really live for this
Progression over digression every day
So when you say 354, that's DLG
And when you DLG that means "we over me" (Diamond!)
