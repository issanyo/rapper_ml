[Verse 1 : Problem]
I'm like the the only nigga  rappin' like a [?] still
Young nigga with that sell from your Chestfield
Hollow tip shots rippin' through that vest feel
My new bitch bad, wonder how my ex feel
Niggas steady speakin' know what's best for me
Same niggas never once brought a check to me
Enemies cast me when on 9, nigga that's fine
Don't need an army to be a soldier, I'mma rep mine anyways
Hate to the [?], brought the Henny through
A nigga gettin' fucked up!
Pull up to the house with my tennis loose
Bumpin' Gin & Juice
A young nigga need to fuck some
Yeah, laced the 23s, 4-5 for the revolution
Mollywood fans man that's my evolution
But you niggas gon' respect my execution
And I still got that Cookie like I'm fuckin' Lucious
Whoo, don't make me throw you in a trash [?]
Pick up your dime now nigga, finna basketball
Cut my fuckin' phone up, I ain't about to answer y'all
What's the problem, y'all finna know the answer y'all


[Hook : A2Thak]
There ain't one jack fo' ya if you tell niggas ain't giant
What I wanted one down bitch, tell nigga he ain't giant
I got a bad ass bitch and a fat ass whip
I got a bad ass bitch and a fat ass whip
I got a bad ass bitch and a fat ass whip
And a gang of money, I don't play that shit
I got a bad ass bitch and a fat ass whip
And a gang of money, I don't play that shit
Man everybody know, man everybody know when I come through
Man everybody know, man everybody know when I come through
Man everybody know, man everybody know


[Verse 2 : Problem]
(Aye, guys, what's goin' on? I'm just livin', you know what I mean)
(It's just another day in this cold world)
I'm like the the only nigga  rappin' like a [?] still
Can't lie to be fuckin' on my ex still
I know I said my new bitch way badder
But a nigga still in love with, how his ex feel
Will never talk bout nothin' I ain't down to do
You gettin' it like us then we proud of you
Hope your money run way longer than ten hammers
Cause we all be around the next ten summers
Couple niggas switched on us when the light left
Guess cause the model hadn't trained in for the fight yet
Make a nigga pick side, but he be scared to chose
How the fuck you gon' win when you scared to lose?
Thatâ€™s why I stay by myself, group chat with the squad strategizing for wealth
My nigga Tom from DLG just stepped in
Independently my nig, the G's that cracked in (Diamond Lane!)
Hungry niggas with an appetite
Bout to knock your bitch pussy to the afterlife
My nigga Poof and Gray with me, I don't have to fight
This from the heart I ain't have to write, nigga
