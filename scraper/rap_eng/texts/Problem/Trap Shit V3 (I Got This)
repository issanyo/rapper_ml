[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
What you got nigga, what I got nigga
What you got nigga, I tell you what I got nigga
Nigga I got this, I've been handed
Ever since my shirt and socks were matchin
I never hit the block with that action
But I get your bitch and I'm smashing
Niggas mad they can't act up
Who the truth you can ask us
Trae tha truth and young problem
Got a hunned goons that mask up
You ain't gonna do a damn thang
Them red boys get on ways
To fly away on this situation
And I don't know what you insinuating
Don't play me like no sucker, I turn up and then fuck her
We real niggas, y'all busters
Got your bitch that blushin
You can try us if you want
I'll tell you what we'll do
Take all of your bitches
And make em fuck the crew, nigga!
