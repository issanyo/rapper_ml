[Intro]
I need all mine, I need all mine
If you don't mind, if you don't mind
I need all mine


[Hook]
I need all mine (2x)
Tryna make ya mine if you don't mind
I need all mine (2x)
Came to get what's mine if ya don't mind
I need all mine (2x)

[Verse 2 - Airplane James]
Can you please stop asking when my s**t gone drop
You got me feeling like that's all you bout
Nowadays
I ain't seen you in the last 5 days
But you wanna drill me about my ways
Girl I always ask you
How you watch me f**k with someone else and be so passive
New n****s in ya life I hope they last you
A n***a like me see you & walk right pass you
You too late to board the plane
You still thinking s**t can be the same
Oh how things have changed
Oh I
Oh I (3x)
I got to come get what's mine
& that's by any means and I can't stop for you and me
Girl I got bigger dreams


[Hook]
I need all mine (2x)
Tryna make ya mine if you don't mind
I need all mine (2x)
Came to get what's mine if ya don't mind
I need all mine (2x)


[Verse 2 - Airplane James]
I might cop them shell-toes outta the slauson
I ain't flossing to be busy bossing
N****s is boring
I'm riding my foreign up Florence
Got the wheels done I want all the h**s to see me
Old h**s wanna see me well keep missing me
With that bullsh** JB done got me back on my bullsh**
I might just slide thru park the whip on yo f**king lawn
I could never f**k with you but your homegirl bomb
Slide her my number text me don't call
Hope you don't fall
I ain't good at that love sh** just letting you know
I been tippin' on 4's I been getting this dough
All at the show screaming 3-5-4
Like 3 Horace Grant jerseys
All these n****s hurting see it in they face
Disgrace we say our grace
And get back to killing n****s
Chach Plane & Yeah
Name a n***a who realer
Exactly n***a


[Hook] I need all mine (2x)
Tryna make ya mine if you don't mind
I need all mine (2x)
Came to get what's mine if ya don't mind
I need all mine (2x)

[Verse 3 - Problem]
If it all went bad would you stay solid
Like if my girl hit yo line would you stay quiet
Like sometimes I think yes but sometimes I think no
But like a phone with no signal I just can't call it
And that ain't all it
All it is kinda complicated
When you this fly it ain't as plane as a conversation
Had to hit young plane and have a conversion
About the do's and the dont's of this sh*t
I ain't gon lie on my momma I hate most of this sh*t
That come with the fame so I became emotional-less
Like
