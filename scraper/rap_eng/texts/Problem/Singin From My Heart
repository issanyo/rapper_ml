(Verse)
They say money ain’t everything
Shut that up, don’t talk to me like a child brah I’m not that young
Even though I’m grown that don’t mean now I ain’t learnin still
Don’t think cuz of fame I can’t get my ass murdered still
So I do the things that really it’s supposed to be
The feel of fuckin failure, shouldn't scare you it should focus you
Girl I’m on my grind on these niggas, I ain’t shinin on these niggas
Have my eye on these niggas if they try, fuck these niggas
It’s what they doin
Y'all fake niggas, y'all can keep that, I don’t want that love
Remember bad deals, I could get it in the car and go spark that plug
Stop betrayin me baby, I'll be back, don’t start that love
And girl should you do me, you already ready for it, I’m finna do it no
Fuck these niggas mane, they don’t know no better
Been 4 months since still my nigga, I ain’t seen no letters
They gave him 50, he should be with me out getting his wealth
Last time we talked he told me he was gonna kill himself
Fuck! I don’t know what I’mma do without my dog
You in the game, gonna yell your name til you get out my dog

(Hook)
My Lord, it’s crazy how this track got me singing from my heart
I’m swerving lane to lane, champagne all in my veins
It’s crazy how this track got me singing from my heart
I’m swerving lane to lane, champagne all in my veins

(Verse)
Damn shame you niggas lame, prayin, bringin niggas pain
Sucker niggas all in pain when the fans yell my name
Like go Problem, go Problem
You think that I don’t want problems, don’t know Problem
That will be second when I feel it
I’m parasailing
Diamonds ain’t from Zales kid
Yea this is the real boys and this that shit we live for
Pop champagne and live for
Grindin' while my kids snore
Mama see my billboard and she went nuts
Bitches actin for a handout, all I give is two fucks
I’ve been drinkin' too much, I’ve been smoking too much
Girl I can’t put it down, roll a joint, puff puff
I ain’t talkin' bout no Diddy
This is really how I’m feelin' everyday
Amaretto mixed with apple juice, make pains go away
I’mma stay up in the booth til you lames go away
Yo have me by that march when you say they name if you pay

(Hook)
My Lord, it’s crazy how this track got me singing from my heart
I’m swerving lane to lane, champagne all in my veins
It’s crazy how this track got me singing from my heart
It’s crazy how this track got me singing from my heart
It’s crazy how this track got me singing from my heart
