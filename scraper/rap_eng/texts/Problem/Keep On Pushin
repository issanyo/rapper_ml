Crack a badder one with some ass on her
So bad that she say she wanna smash on her
Then invite her to the spot yeah
Not yours neutral spot and make sure that Glock there
Cause these hoes can get tricky as a backstreet
Shit ain't wavy, Chach goin out like Max B

A little cousin that slang
Or some nigga that hang with some niggas

Play cool cause any day we"ll have your stuff
And ain't a nigga in LA you can call on us, whaaat

Hangin out in back like a car fin
Women say i act like im dark skinned
Cause every word i say dog my hearts in
Tryna make sure all my counterparts win
Say litlife cause my life lit
5 figure shows so the price fit
Billion dollar goals plus my wife lit
And her pussy feel like a vice grip
Cuz none of these booth niggas had her yet
Stay woke take you adderall
6 kids, 5 women shit i had to ball
Tommy stashed just incase im in the battle zone
Chop choppin at ya clown asses
Half ya favorite rappers was clown dancers
