[Verse 1: Problem]
Great ghost in my system
If you broke better fix it
Oh yo pussy I'm a kiss it
Too real for the fake shit
100 all day
Call it bear bottle money if you call me
On strive, on God
Be the mirror for every nigga that's in my squad
Yea, everything about the figures
And the Beverly sinners
Shoppin with my niggas, turning it up
And these bitches all see us for real
No Neptunes though we got a splice with the script
Like that, it's a known fact, we at yo face with the rip
Trippin, I ain't gotta be off a pill to act a foolie on em
Better round like a nigga got a toolie on em
Saw yo bitch in the club, threw her booty on me
Start poppin that shit
She got high and start droppin that shit


[Hook: Problem]
Drop that shit, bitch
For real, drop that shit, bitch
She got hot in that hoe, straight drop that shit, bitch
Drop that bitch, drop that bitch
Yea, drop that bitch, drop that bitch
Yea, drop that bitch, drop that bitch
Drop that bitch, she got high


[Verse 2: Problem]
If she say she want another pill
Nope, I gotta save that for my other girl
Yea, it's a thought I don't need follow
Barry told me her pussy's feeding the muscato
Popped a pill and I roll these like a taco
Flex a bitch like Dre, YOLO be the moto
Niggas wanna hate, I'm poppin scop like a bottle
Smoked me a joint, don't worry about it tomorrow
From the same city, it's drainin there and I follow
That shit prom, was hittin niggas with hollows
Nigga followed that, birds behind bars
Never hit the league but now niggas is all stars
Get it? (get it?)
Who with it? Not ya'll
I swear I seen you hopin out a cop car
Mmm, that ain't cool
Baby girl I'm that dude so


[Hook: Problem]



[Verse 3: A2Thak]
See all my niggas tryna bring fresh dollar bills
And all my bitches like to twerk just to keep it trill
And all my bitches I'll be with, keep them tights on em
My main like to fuck with the lights on
I be on Hennessey, goose I be mixin
Tatted like a cholo, pocket full of Benjamins
Ridin in that Rari or that Benz with yo BM
Burner on my hip, fuck whoever wanna see em
She choosin, she choosin, she tryna choose up
She know I'm bout that money plus I'm too much
Stick to the script, fuck a bitch, yea literally
Beat er from the back like that, got er feeling me
I be on some other shit, she be on another dick
But every time I text, man her dude turn to her ex
(Bye) got her in a room straight flexin
It's just me and her in the room naked
