[Hook: Jay Ant]
Uh, I'm feelin' like that nigga, I'm feelin like I am [x4]

[Verse 1: Iamsu!]
Okay, yeah I'm back again, so pop it for pimp
This ain't a different situation, I'm fresh for the occasion
Nigga stale as hell, got work online call it AOL
Oops I mean AOB, Why do they hate on me?
Cause I go indo, I don't ever leave no vacancy
Won't ever see no fake in me, the rich won't allow it
I get green like a ?
Call me 6 speed, homie, peep the kick steez
Homie so cold freeze, homie hell naw he don't know me like
Reeboks I'm three hot I came up from nothing now I'm high as tree tops
I'm hot like a furnace, get ripped like a burn disc
I'm somewhere with your bitch, and I'll make her turn tricks, Bitch!
Play the gang on the radio, nigga that's word up like a cameo, Ay!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Problem]
Okay I'm back again, go head pop it for pimp
This ain't a different situation, I'm fresh for the occasion
Whip color Caucasian, chainsaw buzzing big y'all niggas just tazin', Tzz!
Top ten, no ? in that , got yo' bitch bringing it back like she rented it
And I'm takin' it all in pussy open put my dick I think it's September the way it fall in, Like Uhh!
Yeah bitch, how it feel to kick it with a future millionaire bitch
Tick tick, bomb, tick tick, bomb
Rollin' up joints, the size of patons
High as a hill, wanna fly less go Suzy throw them ill kick backs
No retro, petrol, gassin', like a bomb burp
Man we bringing big bands bitch, no concert
