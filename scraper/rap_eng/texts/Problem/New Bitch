[Verse 1 : Problem]
Man ain't acting right
So who wanna ride nigga with that active pipe
How I shiftin' from left, then back to right
Hit it in the morning, you trynna come back tonight
Only when I'm gettin' head is when I appreciate lip
These new ace bitches don't appreciate shit
Cause it's some old [?] ho that's teachin' that bitch
But all that's out the window when I'm deepin' that shit
(I need me a new bitch)
On [?] I ain't comming back because you frontin'
Please know, the one with commas is who run it
You wonder why a nigga just cheat like that

Matter fact I don't trust you anyway

While I [?] my top peace I drop her in my side piece

[Verse 2 : StoneyThaDealer]
You can find me I ain't grizzy
Got some pussy but I don't need it
A head of all lot of move [?]
Dirty ass bitch I'm finna take it to the cleaners
Yeah I used to be in love with the steeze
Baby burnt out swear her ass need Jesus
My sister tried to fight her and my moma don't like her
And to make matters worse on top of that she a liar
(I need me a new bitch)
You see this job is now hiring
My last girl was ratchet now I need me the opposite
And if I see her tonight then I'mma get up on her
Better ask Problem, she ain't bad then I don't want her
I'm lookin' for a freak to tap down and that can dunk it
And we ain't gotta talk about it you can put it on me
If the feeling is amazing I ain't going back to baby
Leave her in the past cause her ass is out dated

[Verse 3 : Bad Lucc]
Better fuck, better cook
Better look better in heels
Got a better purse
Got a better weave and a better cheek to do it
Too late I fell in love that's why I got that beef with Cuban
I'm just sayin'
You plannin' to bitchin' everyday
On me like a segway take the trash out
I thought i took the trash that day
I'm trynna find a best way to leaver her
Suck my dick, surrend everytime I'm bout to leaver her
(I need me a new bitch)
Somethin's up, my side bitch beat [?] a runner up
I pack my canards and a stussie?
Is she dumb enough?
Like who use stussie?
Nigga I'm the fall guy, fallin' out the pussy
Man I need something to book me, like Cookie
And if there's a better woman, let me have
