Blowin sticky, keep a jimmy case yo bitch wanna tempt me
Her nigga grinding, money climbing, give a fuck bout the envy

In La I'm their staple like the Lakers
In VIP with playas workin on my jager
Takin shots like Pac in '96

Pop the droppin toast to the motivation
Bread winnin like my loafs, winnin races
Ride high like that motherfuckin eatin cooly
And you broke, who the fuck you think you foolin?

[Verse 4: Jinsu]
Hate to admit but I'm the nigga she probably with
If I ain't took it down one of my niggas probably hit
Nigga better be glad, now take yo time to acknowledge and quit
Be proud of yo chick, that pussy I devour it quick
