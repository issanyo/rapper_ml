[Intro]
Can I ask you a question? (Yea)
Is life fair? (Uh, uh)
I knew it

[Verse 1: Problem]
Lace up my shoes, kick game for the niggas that need it
Hella weeded, elevated, my mind needed to go
Huh, let me give 'em some more
Terrence, let's get 'em, what up [?]
One time for my nigga
One of the main reasons that I grind for the figures
The way I do, the way He'd done blessed me
You woulda think I done sneezed
Down to my knees, I'm Jeez faster than [?]
[?] 83s who woulda thought we woulda blow
I still remember when a nigga wanted 'em smokes
Got down over a pistol, shit became a [?]
[?] *beep* [?] was me and him in the kitchen
We locked and he got me, it was heavy (fuck)
Hit it for the long haul, but I wasn't ready for them tactics
Thought he did me greezy as chap stick
Did our thing then we talked, yea on some man shit
Responsibility, I was never enhanced with
You here to hold it down nigga, that's it
You fucked it off, so you got to handle it
A fake nigga woulda left it, but me I respected it
Everything ain't 'bout [?], you [?] R.I.P. choose your recipe

[Chorus: Problem & Rose Gold]
I'm man enough to say that
Yea, yea
And I'm man enough to say that
Yea, yea

[Verse 2: Problem]
I ain't been the same since my first child
The tears piled as I tried
13 years later, last week, I just cried
Thinkin' about the future
How my daughter gonna think Kama Sutra the way
Because her father wasn't there to tell her what to say
Or what to do
All she know is momma words
And momma's words got daddy curved out the situation
Broken calls, broken promises, litigations
Done, fucked everything off
You still can't be, after the years of being blind, still can't see
That she using my daughter, to hurt me
But I ain't going nowhere, like true herpes
One thing about life, the truth don't leave
And I know where I stand, no budging
Who ready to face judgement?

[Chorus: Problem & Rose Gold]
I'm man enough to say that
Yea, yea
And I'm man enough to say that
Yea, yea, yea

[Verse 3: Problem]
Everyday I'm out fighting with demons
Contradicting myself trying to find me a reason to keep going
Yea, I done made me a few dollars
Fuck some hoes, made a few cities holla
Bought a few cars, moved into a few casas
But every now and then, God grabbed me by the collar
And let me know this ain't givin' to everybody
You been a petty potty on every nigga around
Boy, realize you blessed
Not many made was able to survive them tests
You know how many jealous I supplied with less?
I know how when you and your name collide you stressed
That's why you keep shinin', you survived the best
You clean shit up, yea defied the mess
For those that ain't got it, you provide the rest
Life's a bitch, so what you menage'd the rest
I've seen you, so you don't dare detest
Make a legacy, while you lived through flesh
C'mon, my bad I'm bitching

[Chorus: Problem & Rose Gold]
I'm man enough to say that
Yea, yea
And I'm man enough to say that
Yea, yea, yea
