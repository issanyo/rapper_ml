’Bout to drop to my knees and just do you
Like you need to be done
Hit this weed
Ass so fat, you can't fit in no jeans
Ooh-wee, got them legs and them thighs like a chicken box
Hot, 'cause I only got it once like the chicken pox
Yeah, I need to run back, 'cause you done that
Hit your panties and your wrists, nigga tryna flood that
Floor hardwood, yeah, baby, ain't no rugs here
Just bomb dick, drank and a gang of drugs here
So what's happenin'?

[Chorus]
What's up, tryna fuck me?

Hell yeah, I'm tryna lick you
Fuck it, take ya tights off (Tights off)
Fuck it, take ya tights off (Tights off)
Fuck it, take ya tights off (Tights off)
Ain’t no need to have the lights off

[Verse 2]
Yeah, lemme see your face
Slide inside, feel it in your waist
I ain't got one on, so if I shoot
I got good genes, girl, all my kids cute
On my mama and my g-pa
Lemme see if I remember your g-spot
You a vixen, I know you need that (Need that big dick)
Big dick and I need to ease back
Can we fuck up them bedsheets? Gotta get it bad
You too, girl, I like a bitch with a bag
Comin' back through and I'ma thug on that pussy
You ain’t even gotta shave, like some fuzz on my pussy
I'm a man, so what's happenin'?

[Chorus]
What's up, tryna fuck me?
Yeah, I'm tryna fuck you
What's up, you tryna lick me?
Hell yeah, I'm tryna lick you

Fuck it, take ya tights off (Tights off)
Fuck it, take ya tights off (Tights off)
