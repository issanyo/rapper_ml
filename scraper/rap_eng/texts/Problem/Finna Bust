See it less cauce, keep going guaranteed to make my love talk
Damn, I can't play like this, fuck it quick
Switch the  positions, when you stand like this

Feeling slow it down, take these sleep as nightquil
(Pulling back) Pulling back, pulling, pulling back
She grab me by the balls and say longer day is at 'em
Like who bitch, I don't think you really want that
Shit move bitch, last time I lift it in up at you
Damn near at you like ha ha, and I was like huh uh
You was like aah ah, and I was like huh uh
And you was like why? And I was like no
And you start to cry, I still had to go so

There's a couple a things that Fabway won't do but share
It's a ganger bang for Fabway gonna do
Grab my dick and she love it, but baby get off
Pussy don't gush without the I could sell it but no
Rather keep it to myself like I hate them floss like
(Ah aah) Hey look what I am tossed
Look like a barbie on a care bear, rode me like a swing set
She ain't got no hair there
I just kissed a pussy like I didn't have a care there
Thug in her ass, baby chill, it's a player there

[Verse 3]
Fresh bought the curb, you can never charge me
They say I wasn't shake cause I had a gang a babies
Had a gang girl, now am looking for a lady
But that's hard to find in the land of the shady
Fresher bought the 80's, flexin on my havy
I heavy, they all wanna  jack you when you out a cali
Check it, niggas gang banging all over
Respect, it, and tryna figure out how I reject it
Neglect it, the whole situation
I don't really have to, brains of a doctor
But got the heart to blast you, cash you
Niggas talk shit till we catch you
Make an example out a of you before I let you
Do the same to me though, I'm feeling like a leader
Somebody gonna take me out even if I keep it in the seen ok
Knockers they want too but because they wanna protect they ego
Ego, ego
