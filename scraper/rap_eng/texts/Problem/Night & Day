[Verse 1: Problem]
This rap game to me is like a pot a gold
Especially when it's a fact I just smoked more than I done sold
Never fold, stay in my mold bro it's winning time
A rottweiler couldn't keep me from the finish line
And I'm scared of dogs, but I ain't scared of ya'll
Slick as Armor All living life till the father call
Ya the money tall, but it ain't tall enough
Say you wanted thunder, what's that number, I'll call your bluff
Taking shots blocka blocka had a pill with it
We in Vegas ace of spades playa deal with it
Enemies turn frenimies once the real get it
Don't wanna hit your joint if there ain't kill in it
Wiz a real nigga, on my momma though
It's a problem no Twitter, better follow though
You better follow us, if you follow though
(Money, clothes, grinder full, lot of chronic smoke)

[Hook: Wiz Khaifa]
Cus getting rich and being broke's like night and day
That's why I'll probably drink and smoke my life away
Don't worry about what they think or what they might could say
I just wake up in the morning like it's time to get paid
They love you then they hate you that's the price you pay
Got all my haters mad feeling some type of way

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Tried to fall back from the gym but it ain't work
Nigga try to pull back on their spending they pockets hurting
Khalifa man so many bars I should be tending
68' soon as I start it you hear the engine
It's been a while since I done popped up
But since I did my bank up big wrist got rocked up
My clothes off the runway, lables let me do what I want
And my money come as easy as Sunday
Started out of state doing shows now we leaving the country
My niggas got my back like gun play
I'm rolling up the most expensive weed that I can find
And if you're looking for me you can find me on my grind
You niggas stealing swag, it ain't hard to tell it's mine
I'm rolling up them zags, it ain't hard to smell it's mine
Ain't open up the bag, but still you can tell it's fire
I just spent $30,000 on a watch I can tell it shine
But don't even tell the time

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Berner]
I tried to step away from the game, I couldn't leave
For the last twelve years I've been hustling weed
Ain't no future [?] but ain't nothing for free
A bunch of friends turn phony it ain't nothing to me
[?] pretty girl on her knees, I'm in Beliz
And a baby blue ocean just enjoying my trees
Look, I already made it, all this is a plus
Take your fingertip and dip it in a bag full of dust
Take a half a mill cash buried in my yard
A lot of rappers go broke tryna be who we are
All these cars in front of my crib, look like a club
But I don't care about none of the fame, just give me drugs
All white [?] with invisible [?]
VVS stones glowing all over my neck
Being rich and being broke is like night and day
I bet a lot of haters want to take my life away

[Hook]
