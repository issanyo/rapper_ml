[Verse: Problem]
Wow wow wow wow
Yo body movin' slow slow slow slow
On molly, dope, come down down down down
Tell dope girl cause we grown grown grown grown
Chachi kamikaze I'ma kill that
One time where the real at? Two times where the real at?
Pop it then kneel back, swing around throw your hair back
Big poppa gon' kill that
Like baby baby, we do it big for the 80's
Won't let a sucka nigga play me
Nah nah never no no, we can bounce like a pogo
I eat the pussy on the low low  what?
