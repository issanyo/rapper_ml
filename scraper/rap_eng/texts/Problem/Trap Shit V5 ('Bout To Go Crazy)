Aw, yeah
I’m up in the building
High out my mind, I’m walking on the ceiling
Drink a lot of liquor; we all know the feeling
(I think I … I think I … I think I …)
Wait

Aw, yeah
I’m up in the building
High out my mind, I’m walking on the ceiling
Drink a lot of liquor; we all know the feeling
(I think I … I think I … I think I’m ‘bout to go cra'!)


(I think I … I think I … I think I’m ‘bout to go cra'!)


[Hook]


Off a molly and a half, in a champagne bath
With the attitude the size of a billboard ad
(What!?)
My day fucked up; yeah, my life gone bad
I’m a drink ‘til a nigga don’t feel no sad
I’m a smoke ‘til my lung bust, give it ‘til my girl curse
Sig' me the cute nurse
(Please, could you help me?)
Crack her then fuck her, then dump her
That bitch which’ll knew that I wasn’t worth shit when she met me!
(What!?)
Mix in the white with the nasty
Pop me another, then roll like a trucker
I have the urge to pick up a bottle
Take a last swallow, then crack me a fucker
Tempers erupt and I need to calm down
But I’m so high, I’m scared to look down
Pupils is red. I’m half-way dead
I close both lids and I hear this sound
(What!?)


Aw, yeah
I’m up in the building
High out my mind, I’m walking on the ceiling
Drink a lot of liquor; we all know the feeling
(I think I … I think I … I think I …)
Wait

Aw, yeah
I’m up in the building
High out my mind, I’m walking on the ceiling
Drink a lot of liquor; we all know the feeling
(I think I … I think I … I think I’m ‘bout to go …)
