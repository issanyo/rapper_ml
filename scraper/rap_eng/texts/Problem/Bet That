[Verse 2: Problem]
Fuck what they on and I keep my life private in school with the kids with the uniform on
Finding a nigga that's solid these days bruh you gotta better a chance of bringing a unicorn home
Beautiful homes have my kids over they play in the back
Girl if I buy you some titties and we break up
Four mamas I'm needin' em  back
Why go to roll with a couple of dope
Thank God I'm alive I feel blessed with the pope

Soft henny I want more like Demi
If like is a bitch I will lick and eat it and kiss it
And pin it and hit it and lick it and kiss it again
And kiss it again till she calling for heaven
Cause life is the man and I leave she gon make sure

And teach things so no more niggas can play you no
