[Hook: Kevin McCall]
When you drop it to the floor, you know that turn me on
You know that turn me on, you know that turn me on
When you pick it up slow, you know that turn me on
You know that turn me on, you know that turn me on
And when, and when you slide down that pole
Baby, that turn me on
And when you wind it in slow mo
Baby that turn me on

[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
Listen, I got a fetish for bitches who do they shit in the kitchen
After I hit it she cooking chicken and washing the dishes
You hoes should learn something, bout a trill bitch
She don't need my money cause she got her own shit
Saks fifth splurging with that money she got from working the night shift
So I might just dress her up in diamonds, her body colder than ice is
You know that turn me on
Tell DJ Holiday to play your favorite song, cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Problem]
All these niggas tired, all these niggas liars
Pulling up with fives saying all they fuck is dimes
If winning is a crime, y'all gonna lock me up quick
I'm with the illest birdie, getting my duck sicked
Real is all I fuck with, bought that cash money
Open that gate, hope my Trukfit, Diamond, Lake Republic
Ho, I corrupt before I commit, I say it and she does it
I stay playing the game, hate it or love it, what?

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Let me see you pop it, pop it, pop it
Pop it, pop it, pop it
Now let me see you drop it, drop it, drop it
Drop it, drop it, drop it

[Hook]
