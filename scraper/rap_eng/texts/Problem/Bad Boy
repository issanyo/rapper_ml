Need a nigga that’ll have you hotter than a sauna
Street nigga you can bring home to your momma
When I be grindin you be textin me all crazy
When I’m done I pull ‘em down and kiss it all crazy
Yeah Yeah Yeah
It be good to you
The way I talk, the way I walk, you love it, its so hood to you
Me and your ex act so different it’s crazy
Stay up on my hood shit, baby we made it
Ride wit me, you know I got the pistol in the back
I’mma grab you from the Valley then fuck you in the trap
You know I’m never worried bout your last boy
Cuz every bad bitch need a bad boy

All she wanna do is fuck with a bad boy
Fuck fuck with a bad boy
All she wanna do, it’s all she wanna do
Is fuck with a bad boy
Bad boy, need this in your life

Cuz your man just ain’t your type
Talkin bout a bad boy, bad, bad boy

Talkin bout a bad boy, bad, bad boy
All she wanna do is fuck with a bad boy

Gettin paid stayin fly is the swag of bad dudes
Haters hear I gotta bad chick and call it bad news
Girls like bad so it's prison when I spit it
Cuz these bars get pussy that's a conjugal visit
Ironic in a bad boy she'll never lose faith
Cuz she know it's downhill after Bad Boy, Mase

Ride with a queen cuz she love when I flex
Tattoos on my body got her all damn wet
Cuz I'm a bad boy I should sign to Bad Boy
