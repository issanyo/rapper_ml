[Intro:]
Just wait for it
Just, just, just wait for it
Just, just,just wait for it
Just, just, just
(Holiday season)

[Chorus:]
A.L.L and everything that comes with it ( I want it, I want it)
You can see it in my hustle it ain’t hard for you to tell (I’m on it, I want it, I want it)
I’m in the bitch like
Just, just, just wait for it
Just, just, just wait for it
Just, just, just wait for it
Just, just, just
I’m in the bitch like

[Verse 1:]
Turning  with my niggas and these hoes too
Celebrating winnings like a real nigga suppose to
When you made it up out the gutter
I keeping the gutter
Never switch
Life’s a bitch but I swear I love her
Put a rubber on a bitch nigga daily
Cashed out on that new chevy, drive 80
Nigga balling hard like when Coby drop eighty….one
Trap, trap, trap until the police come
They try to flat a nigga
These unloyal assholes
Can’t stop a nigga from getting to the paper...(oh no)
Diamond lace, self made we don’t need a favor
Who need a major
We getting green by the age
Nigga

[Chorus ]

[Verse 2:]
Rap in my game, rap in my city
Realest nigga left
Grab a condom for a woman
Stay down with your bros
Never fuck em off for hoes
Hundred steady goals
Watch how fast you cut fifty dollars
Hundreds and two hundreds more
Triple that, that’s mine
Cash calendar, look at me
Call that’s mine
What (woohoo wow)
Daddy bought the bar and I’m no code
Had a new bitch with it
Give a fuck about my image
Pussy fucking
Fuck the pussy
Tell the pussy come and get it
Imma do it till I win it
Losing ain't a fucking option
Seems like on a flash flood
Plus I’m straight up out of Compton

[Chorus]
