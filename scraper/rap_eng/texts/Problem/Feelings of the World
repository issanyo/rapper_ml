[Verse 1: Rose Gold]
It's Saturday, Hathaway is playing on the radio
Remember when [?]
Look at how time flies
Things looking different for you and I
[?] 2 eleven, a gang of weed
We can [?] whatever to pay the lease
Oh my God, the rent is late
We done messed around and lost the place
Funny how time flies
Things are so different for you and I

[Verse 2: Problem as Chachi (& Rose Gold)]
All them long nights on the road
High, getting lost in my phone
Scrolling, scrolling for attention
Try calling my woman
We ain't talk since yesterday morning
I guess her heart I've broken
For the last time
I'm conflicted, I'm addicted
To making love to other women
My decisions are affecting
My mission to be a better man
(Funny how time flies)
Man I hope she ain't found a better man, a gentleman
Someone that opens doors and holds her hand in public
And all types of things like that
How it was fucking them girls, babe I was gon' get right back
I know once trust is lost you can't get it back
No, no, no
Waitâ€•she just sent a text to my phone
Saying, "(Things are so different for you and I)"
Damn

[Verse 3: Rose Gold]
Things can't be
The way that they used to be, no
Memories
Yesterday is gone
Memories
Are always here in my heart
Things are meant to be
Exactly what they are
