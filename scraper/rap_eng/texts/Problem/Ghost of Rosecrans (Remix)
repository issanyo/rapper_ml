[Chorus]
You a bad bitch, bring yo bad friend's too
You you a bad bitch, bring yo bad friend's too
You you a bad bitch, bring yo bad friend's too
You you a bad bitch, bring yo bad friend's too

[Pre-Chorus]
Go up and down, let me hear say yeah
Move it all around, let me hear say yeah
Want a nigga around, let me hear say yeah
Let me hear ya say yeah, let me hear ya say yeah
Let me hear ya say yeah

[Verse 1]
4-5 on me right now
Nigga hit the switch, it be light's out
Police asking me, I don't know shit
Never ever catch me on some other shit
Baby on my line, money on my line
Baby, I ain't got the time, shit I'm on my grind
Disrespect my game, I won't hold back
Baby want it all 'cause I'm all that

[Chorus]
You a bad bitch, bring yo bad friend's too
You you a bad bitch, bring yo bad friend's too
You you a bad bitch, bring yo bad friend's too
You you a bad bitch, bring yo bad friend's too

[Pre-Chorus]
Go up and down, let me hear say yeah
Move it all around, let me hear say yeah
Want a nigga around, let me hear say yeah
Let me hear ya say yeah, let me hear ya say yeah
Let me hear ya say yeah

[Verse 2]
Baby ride with me 'cause I know things
Kiss her from clit to her nose ring
Her man come around, I don't know shit
'Cause if I say something, I be on some other shit
Baby on my line, baby on my line
Rubbing on that ass 'cause that ass is mine
Nigga run up on me, I won't back down
Thought I was alone, now he packed out

What?!

[Chorus]
You a bad bitch, bring yo bad friend's too
You you a bad bitch, bring yo bad friend's too
You you a bad bitch, bring yo bad friend's too
You you a bad bitch, bring yo bad friend's too
