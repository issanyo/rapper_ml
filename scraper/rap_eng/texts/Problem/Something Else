[Hook: Problem]
I remember when you told me
That you'd never leave me
But that ain't what you showed me
When you up and ran away from us, away from this
Away from life, away from kids
Away from hugs, away from love
And everything I thought we both wanted
That’s when I found out you wanted something else, else, else
That’s how I found out you wanted something else, else, else!
That’s how I found out you wanted something else, else, else!

[Verse: Terrace Martin]
Huh, same day, different women
But you’re the only one that I want with me
True love from day one
So when I got it right, you wanna change up!
If this ain’t what you want, then girl, say so
You complaining, when everything is paid for
Growing more distance as the days go by
I can’t lie, I admit, is kinda painful, huh!
Just when I think we’re doing cool
You remind me that we not you keep playing me for a fool
All the playing games and stepping out on you I used to do
I don’t now, but it’s like you don’t appreciate the new..
Me, tell me how you really feel
You’re tripping, but I love you still
Huh, are you ready willing and able? I am!
So what’s the deal? Huh!

That’s how I found out you wanted something else, else, else!

[Verse: Terrace Martin]
Uh, same man, changed woman
Feels like I’m begging when I know I shouldn’t
Gave you everything them other men wouldn't
Did you take away my love when I wasn’t looking
Yeah, that’s what it seems like
You’re in love with me, but only in the meantime
Late night texting, convos with your exes
I ain’t even press you, even though I seen the messages
Gotta speak your mind and let it out
Or let me go, guess you got some things to figure it out
Baby, just do you
I tell you what, don’t even call, and let me do me too!
I couldn’t be the man for you
So hopefully when you meet somebody, you tell him the truth
Until then, get your mind right!
I wish you the best! I’m on the quest for real love
And you can keep the stress, I’m gone, gone!
