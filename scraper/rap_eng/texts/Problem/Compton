Compton

[Hook]
Often imitated never duplicated, boy I’m from
Compton
Well pussy niggas never make it out, gang of niggas claim it
Some of them niggas famous but they ain't it
On my mama, I ain't never seen them niggas up in
Compton
A few niggas that I grew with ain't here
They told me they biggest fear was that they ass
Was for sure gon’ die right here in
Compton
When I'm outta town, they ain't gotta ask
Don't look around niggas know [?]
Where I walk, where I talk, where I shit, that  a nigga from
Compton

[Verse 1:Problem]
Fuck with no nigga that don't fuck with me
Bitch you lower than a ho if you fuck for free
Blowing bombest tree, with Bahamas freaks
Yelling death to fakes pray your [?]
I don't lie like [?] I'm out here searching for it
If it ain't making no money It ain't no purpose for it
Playing games with a pussy niggas is perfect for it
The new Glock got a shot you looking perfect for it
All black on the stainless, black, rich and dangerous
Me and y’all team don’t speak the same language
Famous and faded, I’ll fade with the famous
Pussy eatin’ P, this is me, it ain’t changin’
Never!
’Cause the city I’m from, I pop that shit
That make Diddy go dumb
Push that shit that makes cities go numb
[?]
Mothafucka this
Compton
All day everyday, glide in that Chevrolet
Sparring like a heavyweight
[?] Kush got me in that [?]
Often imitated never duplicated, boy I’m from
Compton

[Hook]
Well sucka niggas never make it out, gang of niggas claim it
Some of them niggas famous but they ain't it
On my mama, I ain't never seen them niggas up in
Compton
A few niggas that I grew with ain't here
They told me they biggest fear was that they ass
Was for sure gon’ die right here in
Compton
When I'm outta town, they ain't gotta ask
Don't look around niggas know [?]
Where I walk, where I talk, where I shit, that  a nigga from
Compton
Like that, just like that, its
Compton

[Verse 3: Problem]
Where is the throne i'm ready to sit down
All of these niggas is rapping like this now
Got dollars [?] dont care about no friction
My hood full of riders that pop your suspicions
LL boy without the kangol though
Problem bout to bring back the gang bang flow
Drinking on sobriety menace to society
Nigga throw it up like when k came home
From a jail cell [?]
Boy pop fly but i ain't tryting to catch an L
[?] Boy i can bring you hell
Want that fire boy i can bring a barrel
Need it now i can swoop like a nigga shell
Need it all [?]
Diamond lane ain't the kind you violate
Don't blame me this a Compton nigga mindstate
Bred by the winners [?]
Hit a rock then they take it in
Kids knowing that they momma on feel it in the wind
Fucked up part is she bought to walk from her friends
Real spit
