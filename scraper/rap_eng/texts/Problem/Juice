[Verse 1: Kal Duzay]
Yeah, FQCY, nigga!
What? What?
They call me Duzay!
Fuck y'all mean?!
Buck forty-five-nine looking like Yao Ming!
I mean, damn!
Fuck y'all saying?!
We blowing different color O's, nigga Tucan Sam!
I mean shit, bitch I'm it!
I got the whole suburbs on my dick!
A couple girls with my autograph on their tits
I don't care who's pitching, nigga, I'm over that fence
I rock slim straight jeans, kiss my ass
Cause you can still catch me on 4-8 ave
Im a weirdo, Pardon the other me for interrupting me
Now back to the mindfuckery!
FTCY nigga, that's that squad
And I rep that real, motherfucking hard
Motherfuck that Dutch
Nigga, pass that bong
And try to guess the mix of the bitch on my arm!

[Hook: Kal Duzay]
I got juice!
Bitch I got juice
Bitch I got juice
Juice, bitch I got juice
Bitch I got juice
Bitch I got juice
Bitch, I got juice, juice!
Bitch I got juice (what?)
Bitch I got juice!

Pull up a game, nigga
Counting ' fire, bro
Robbing fast, getting head down a larger butt
Cool' stay clean like an off season!
Pray for my enemies, they'll be all bleeding!
Putting niggas with a', that's my emo
Music loud, throwing Ls above the window
(What it do?)
Love for a sucker bitch, are you in, oh? (No, no, no)
Main racks OT, I pretend, oh!
Pretty long is our limo
Roll like a wheel, but I spin more
Found my bitch a new'
Then lay my head on the pillows
Fresh fuck like a photo punk
Dray lips to get homo junk
..starting your whole call
Use your ass, go promo!

[Hook]

I'm so juiced up
I've been so hot
This red cup got me feeling violent like oh no!
I am party, I go so hard
Fuck your'
No rules, no loss!
But never to see me
I'll be on my '
One whip with the back seats
Nigga, I love new say!

One thing about me, nigga
I'll be on some ultimate shit!
If you're asking about me niggas
You're on some ultimate shit!
