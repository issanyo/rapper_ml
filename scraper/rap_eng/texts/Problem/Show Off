[Hook : Manolo Rose]
Bankroll, real money never fall
Diamond line
Yeah hoe you ain’t know?
My God [?] card
I bought 10 gold chains I’mma show off
Yeah lil mama I’mma show off
I got my weight up now I show off
I got my weight up now I show off
I got my weight up now you show off



[Verse 1 : Problem]
I ain't got nothing left to prove
Money flow sturdier than a cruise
Ooh, eight hundred a foot walk in my shoe
Crack bitches while hatin' niggas copy my moves
Barkin louder than my weed my G, I still ain’t enthused
Went from packin' hoes, to packin' foes to packin' shows
Crackin' shows [?] actives hoes
Pretty talls with their back exposed
Molly dip, take a trip baby pack some clothes
Let's go

[Verse 2 : Problem]
Who trynna get there ?
You 'bout them broke niggas ain’t trynna sit there
Baby it’s my time no wrist wear
Smokin' on OG, yellin' FREE BG!
Giver her dick bet she trip like she fail on the floor
Hustlin', watchin' every step like it’s a nail in the floor
[?]
Let it wrip, 'till a snitch ain’t tellin’ no more
Whaat

[Verse 3 : Problem]
Got me bangin' Mollywood it's about to get deep
Last time I see [?] 16
It was 3 am, thought his ass go home
Got the call from lil Chris, say his little bro gone
I'm like "is nigga dead?" he like "no, the po got him"

[?] gettin' addicted to them pills
Just probably better off that the fuckin' [?] got him
Fuck that!
Please help me, I’m trying to find a better way
Gettin' high on  the search for a better day
Flying South-West, say you wanna get away
Take it how it is, couple of more sips
[?] nigga bitch, fuck it

[Verse 4 : Bad Lucc]
I’m just a little woa nigga, with some big ass dreams
Married to the game, money right with your queen
I told her [?] get your momma, you don't know her right?
And she ain't seen that many diamonds in her whole life
Fella's in the club, raise her hand in the air if you’re the man
Let him grab your titties, let em touch if he can
If he ain’t talkin’ money, baby, let him know what’s the plan
[?] back to the ground
[?]
It's Bad Lucc baby I'm the tall guy
Pull up to the ground
I don’t even care then it’s back to the VIP
Break bread with Bloods, gettin' money with Crips
I’m just an East Side nigga lookin' as can be
365 I’ll be on the ground
Get it how I live I’ll be blowin’ their minds
