Problem: Come a lil closer lemme get a taste
Yeah its really working feel it in my face
Drinkin liquor straight I don't need a chase
I wanna fuck again we just need a place
Don't matter what time it is one day I'mma die so I'm tryna live
In this very moment, very moment cause life is shorter than Gary Coleman
So when I swig I do it big like B-I-G I'm on my T-I-P she on my T-I-P all on my E-Y-E want me to B-U-S all on her T-I-T's for real
Oh I think I like that

Baby if she pop it she'll be gone she'll have you in your drawers
She go both ways girl she down to fuck us all so whats up

(Chorus)

Trinidad James: This molly mary jane my nigga Problem Gunplay

Don't get no molly in my blunt but put this molly on your tongue
Watch your eyes get wide and your tongue get numb
Oh Sweat dance turn up (x8)

But if she ain't up on this dick, then where she at?
