[Verse 1]
I’m about to go crazy and I don’t  know why
My life living like a nigga can’t die
Smoking and drinking daddy everyday
Should have got real should have got away
So take me away take me away
Take me away take me away
And put me in the clouds like my niggas that’s
Resting in peace come for you in time
From the west to the east
Every body from the burbs all the way to the streets
When A devil playing no he playing for keeps
Thats why am not hear slippin no never never
Never love life but I’m good what ever
Mama told them I was raised up in Compton
Throwing that chedda block throw yours up
If you don’t think this is a better block
We men plus our little homie better blocks
Speed bumps but you know this is the ghetto block
All love yea but you know all of us fold
But you know your rumors ain’t nothing
But you bring over loads and nobody
And nobody trip because it goes both ways every time
Bitches I ain’t chillin so I ain’t change for these dimes
Dogs on deck so got cage for these nines
Mission is a ticket so change for the find

[Hook]
I’m about to go crazy and I don’t know why
No we living like a nigga can’t die
Smoking and drinking daddy ain’t dead
Shit getting real real need to get away
So take me away take me away
Take me away take me away
I’m about to go crazy and I don’t know why
No we living like a nigga can’t die
Smoking and drinking daddy ain’t dead
Shit getting real real need to get away
So take me away take me away
Take me away take me away

[Verse 2]
Hold you I just lost like yeay on a plate
Just her I got a baby on the way
My ex to my best friend on a date
I want to flex but I’m too real to hate
Fuck them both shit I’m better off without them
Love my dealer hay but I would never ever doubt him
Fucking with me let me hear you holla
Living for the day because we ain’t guaranteed tomorrow
So I’m out here stuntin tryin to stay jumping
Legalize the bread so they can’t say nothing
Smoking like a train straight to the brain
But can’t keep a nigga from going insane

[Hook]
I’m about to go crazy and I don’t know why
No we living like a nigga can’t die
Smoking and drinking daddy ain’t dead
Shit getting real real need to get away
So take me away take me away
Take me away take me away

[Verse 3]
Staring at the past too feeling this bitch of mine
Ends thirty working my Goddamn nerves
Homies think I’m trippin ain’t seen me in a minute
Nigga really I’m just out here tryin to make this work
I’m about to go crazy and I don’t know why
Nigga I swear if I smoke another blunt I’m going to die
Thinking about my brother Frank make a nigga want to cry
Then you got another seven and we all know why
I just talk to T-Fat for ever that’s my guide
And Tony Mo you got a big mouth lying mode yea
And as a man as do I became I swear do your thing
I love you oh God and the Henny on the block
Because I’m feeling kind of pop
Bleasely Bro you really wasn’t lying because it’s only at the top
And I don’t really like the ocean so I’m feelin bored of yacht
Come and take me away before they come and raid my spot

[Hook]
I’m about to go crazy and I don’t know why
No we living like a nigga can’t die
Smoking and drinking daddy ain’t dead
Shit getting real real need to get away
So take me away take me away
Take me away take me away

[Verse 4]
Baby girl you can go on top and
I swear you just don’t want to stop
Ride a nigga until he hits that spot
Lil mam show me what you got
If you want to back it up then drop
Fuck a nigga in a parking lot
Yea right here right here You
Going to fuck me so good I’m going
To want to spend the night here
Young and wild with it I know
That pussy got some miles on it
Them other niggers was made to it
I’m going to come an put some smile on it
Cause you thick and delicious
And the fact that you can be so vicious
I am ambitious I’m ambitious
I got a gang more of bitches

[Hook]
I’m about to go crazy and I don’t know why
No we living like a nigga can’t die
Smoking and drinking daddy ain’t dead
Shit getting real real need to get away
So take me away take me away
Take me away take me away
