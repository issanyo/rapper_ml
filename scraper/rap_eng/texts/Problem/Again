[Intro]
Hello how you doing
I know you ain’t heard from me in a while
Yeah I went and got another man
But fuck it boo I gotta be real

[Pre-Hook]
I just wanna fu*k you again
No a bitch can’t lie I wanna fu*k you again

[Hook]
I know I know I know you seeing somebody
Yeah I got somebody but I can’t keep lying to myself
Daddy I wanna fu*k you again
And again
And again
And again
And again

[Verse 1]
Ain’t go lie I wasn’t expecting this call this quick
It’s only been three months since I've been inside you
I changed my number you changed your number
But I knew if I wanted to I'd find you or you’ll find me
All on instagram acting like you happy
Knowing good and God damn well you ain’t
(I want that pussy girl)
Had to go back to your past to find your future
Knowing that’s something that you hate, to do
So I applaud you baby I applaud your effort
All that falling off your mouth I don’t think you learned your lesson
Saying that you don’t need a nigga, that you didn’t want a nigga
You couldn’t find another that’s as wild a dick as me
I remember (I remember )
Every damn argument we had after hit
Saying that you’ll never come back again
Even when I told you you would
I ain’t gonna lie I thought about it hold on my boo is calling
Gotta hold on (beep)
(Sup lil mama, I'm doing sumtin’ I’ma hit you right right back hold on)
I'm back you mad ain’t you, you can’t be
You made this this way, I cheated yeah I know I know I know
But I ain’t sure this is what I need to do
Cause I think you wanna love me again
But I ain’t tryna fu**ing pretend that I feel the same way

[Pre-Hook]
I just wanna fuck you again
No a bitch can’t lie I wanna fuck you again

[Hook]
I know I know I know you seeing somebody
Yeah I got somebody but I can’t keep lying to myself
Daddy I wanna fuck you again
And again
And again
And again
And again

[Verse 2]
How we end up naked again
How the hell we end up naked again
How how how
Again again
How how how
Wait a fucking minute again is that my girl
Oh hell no ! oh shit
I just got finished giving the hotel manager the room key
And paid my bill
I was outside in the car I was in the parking lot
Telling the woman I was with how happy she made me
Kissing and hugging
And all of a sudden another car pulled up in the parking lot
But I couldn’t believe my eyes
Cause the woman that was sitting in the front seat
Beside another dude
Turned out to be my old lady
Lord I was checking out
And she was checking in
Yeah yeah
Let me tell you people
I was checking out
And my old lady was checking in
I was with my other woman
And she was with her boy friend

Fuck it!
