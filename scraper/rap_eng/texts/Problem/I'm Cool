[Intro]
Mo' life, mo’ weed
I see you lookin' at me but I'm out’cho league
I could tell how you move but you not my speed
Not sayin' less about you, it's more about me
So-

[Break]
Little nigga bang back
Fuck, where that ass at
Bitch, where that cash at?
Bitch, where that cash at?

[Verse 1]
'Cause if you ain't on that, you really gettin' laughed at
I'm on a fast track, and I'm not tryna flash back
To my crazy days, yeah, I had some crazy ways
It was a crazy phase, but, nigga, I got crazy pay
Woo, caught a few crazy fades
Though I’m still with the shit, each day it fades
So much shit done changed, shit, mostly me
Drugs had me makin’ decisions emotionally
Allowin' motherfuckers to get too close to me
But now, a nigga like-

[Break]
Little nigga bang back
Fuck, where that ass at
Bitch, where that cash at?
Bitch, where that cash at?

[Bridge]
Forever on that and I ain’t buyin' how y'all look
Paper and ink don't make you a book, nigga
Bro, little nigga bang back

[Verse 2]
My mind different
I’m listenin' more, talkin' less
Ain't focused on L's, I'm talkin' best
I'm talkin' wins, I'm speakin' wins into existence
Thank God for his persistence
Huh
But I was lettin' him down, now-
Fuck where that ass at?
'Cause, baby girl, we past that
You ain't mine, so why would I even ask that?
I'm on a fast track, you still tryna flash back
You reminiscin' about ass smacks in public
Tellin' me to stop, knowin' that you love it
I liked it too
But a nigga like to hustle more than I'm likin' you

[Break]
Little nigga bang back
Fuck, where that ass at
Bitch, where that cash at?

[Bridge]
Forever on that and I ain't buyin' how y'all look
Paper and ink don't make you a book, nigga

[Verse 3]
And I might go over your head
You need money stacked to sit tall as my leg
Changed my hidin' spot, it was under my bed
Now right there is that thang that'll blow off your head
And I pray to God I never have to use it, on moms
Me or you, and I get to choose, Allfather
And I ain't say that shit to be tough or rah-rah
I'm just tryna make sure my kids have a father
So respect my G
And if you buyin' goods from me, please respect my fee
I done earned every motherfuckin' right

[Interlude]
Hold on
Uh
So to whoever wanna clash nigga-

[Break]
Little nigga bang back
Fuck, where that ass at
For real
Bitch, where that cash at?
Bitch, where that cash at?
What
