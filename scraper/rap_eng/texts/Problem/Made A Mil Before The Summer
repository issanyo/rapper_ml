[Hook x2]
I made a mil before the summer
I made a mil before the summer baby
I made a mil before the summer
Just gimme my money I'm smoking with the homies

[Verse 1: Problem]
Smoking with the homies made a mil before the summer
Baby I'm a player let me stick it like a drummer
You hotter than the summer
She ride it and she cum all over my dick
Ho yell out my clique
Diamond Lane
Y-Y-Yeah that's us
Blowing Laker purple got me goin' like Buss
RIP E ho don't ask us
My homegirls ride big and I don't mean no bus
Oh my ma-ma, they'll fuck you up
Know some niggas babies mamas that'll suck me up
Got a tour with some niggas like "fuck he buff"
Still punch til his nose swoll as Humpty Hump
On ma-ma

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Bad Lucc]
I go, I told her
OG, please roll it
OT like OV man I'm so keyed she loaded
So beast - can't hold him
Drinking a SoBe, so cold
When I'm so deep in a OP
Baby know me, she on it
Oh see, she knowing
Man I blow trees with the homies
So much weed to that boy B
I could OD at the moment
Money heavily on em
I suggest, eh rest
Tickle on that Nestle
Make her grab it like a Espy
Check me? Never, I be coolin
Rappin out of my mind
It's murda inc. and I'm Ja Rulin'
All about the game
I'm in control you kids [?]
Plus I got the city cracking all the slappin' we be doing

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Kent]
Black bitch white bones
Fuckin ya baby mama in the Doms at her mom's
Now leave me alone
Drop a 4 in a deuce to make my life speed up
I've fucked every bitch in this club
The homie got the burner tucked
Got Problems and Bad Lucc (What)
Tell yo bitch I used to love her
Everybody been up in her like the homie back house
I remember everything bitch, I ain't blacked out
Pay me right now
Pop it pop it make that ass go down
Pull them Vicky Secrets down
Fuck her good make your bitch say ouch
