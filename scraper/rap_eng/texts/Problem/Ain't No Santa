[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
Won't you come sit on my lap?
And tell me all the things on your wish list
I already know you've been bad
But I still might let you get your way

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
If you play your cards right
I don't really care if you've been naughty or nice
Hop on my sleigh, we can ride all night
Sippin' eggnog, how you ride all night, for real

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Let's have a very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
Filled with love and joy and happiness and lots of good cheers
I want you to have a very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
Filled with love and joy and happiness and lots of good cheers

[Verse 2: Problem]
Here's the boy as hood as a Christmas comin'
With stuffer stockers and vodka shots
Ball in my sun, the baller shit that his poppa got
Daughter spoiled rotten too, best plan for all the crew
Momma smokes, so you know I get her lease a zipper too
Easy, the world will jug you if you let them
I bust my ass for the cash, kids, it ain't no Santa
That's all me, that's all me, what?

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
Baby, come sit on my lap
I'll take you round the world in one night
You ain't gotta pack no bags
'Cause I'ma have you home by Christmas Day

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
If you play your cards right
I don't really care if you've been naughty or nice
Hop on my sleigh, we can ride all night
Sippin' eggnog, how you ride all night, for real

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Let's have a very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
Filled with love and joy and happiness and lots of good cheers
I want you to have a very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
Filled with love and joy and happiness and lots of good cheers
