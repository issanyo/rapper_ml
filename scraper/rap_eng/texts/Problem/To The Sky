[Chorus:]
If you getting money but your middle finger is high
If you getting money but your middle finger is high to the sky
To the sky, to the sky, to the sky

[Verse 1:]
I’m on the pace to riches, they try to stop me, Glock me
They get mad when i pull up fresh
They mention my name when they say who’s next
Gorman, Ray, Leo and okuweh
Am the young fly nigga getting your boo wet
Still  make the most gees, doing code two step
I do it for the real though it’s so few left
Right handed but I knock you with a cold ass left
What?
Swinging, got me spinning
Got them screaming when I’m between them
Better cream them, no coffee
Niggas hate that I stay and am so bossy
So Flossy, at the same time, at the same time
Put your ex and your next,  at the same time
Wanna flex, we can trip, I brought my K-9
It’s to spare time, here we all on the main line
What’s that?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Here to make money, I ain’t  here to make friends
Garlic my life, me and that same twin
Middle fingers up to the decoys
Where the money, where the hoes, where the D- boys?
What? We right here
Comptown fresh in my D-boy gear
Gover Lang Gang where are a force in deed
Deed we’re down (yeah)
I run Ds and Cs with the town (What?)
Every time I speak, am of the least
Toxigen am bringing at your teeth
Got to preach, ghetto gospel, proud collassle
Inhale kush and blow smoke out nostrils
The ladies love this nigga cause they know am with the bennies
Talk all these things about me but they tell it like i'm winning
Black track shoes, use the white for the trimming
And it’s a medium trim, be boppin cause i'm nice and slim

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
You know what?
Am trying to get the million
Bulk cheese, no prodo
Flying on my logo, Swagging like codo, yolo
Swiming more wacks than shark
Got more hoes than a cart
What?
Really on one, I don't advise you to start
And you Tai Pai welcome to around these parks
Get on your grind, your car looking dirty
Every day I get cake, every birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Live life like tomorrow is your hearse day
High and I’m broke when I a feel it
Wake up every day like am gonna get a million
What?
It ain’t no fun when no friend is left
Relax my mind, do not do stress
Holla at your girl, what did you do
Pull it out there and hit her with the vudu
What?

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Hey yow, fuck these niggas [x10]
We don't give a fuck
They don't give a fuck
