Paroles de la chanson Luckiest Man :

(Verse)
Couldn't let you walk down the street without me saying something to you
Cause girl you are so fine (girl you are so fine)
When you told me your name that's when I knew
That I had to make you mine

You got me like Jodecy, I'm fienin
I can barely get anything done cus I'm thinking of you
Of all the things I'm dreaming
Til you bring your fine ass around
Til you bring your fine ass around
And I be like

(Hook)
I'm the luckiest man in the world, I'm the luckiest man in the world
I'm the luckiest man in the world, I'm the luckiest man in the world
(I got you)
I'm the luckiest man in the world, I'm the luckiest man in the world
I'm the luckiest man in the world, I'm the luckiest man in the world
(I got you)

(Verse)
I'm like Usher, I'm confessing
All these other girls bad but it gets no better than you
These niggas think that they got one
Til I bring your fine ass around
Til I bring your fine ass around
And I be like

(Hook)
I'm the luckiest man in the world, I'm the luckiest man in the world
I'm the luckiest man in the world, I'm the luckiest man in the world
(Now that I got you)
I'm the luckiest man in the world, I'm the luckiest man in the world
(I'm so off it)
I'm the luckiest man in the world, I'm the luckiest man in the world

(Every chance I'mma show it
Damn if I've known this girl, I hope you know that)

(Verse)
Nothing takes the place of you
Baby ain't no substitute, there ain't no substitute
Cause you're all that I want and need
Baby only you can set me free

(Verse: Problem)
Problem
Ride with a winner boo
Let me show you how to live like a winner do
Let me moonlight candlelight dinner you
Interviews then hopefully I enter you later on
(What?)
I'm so crazy, I shouldn't have said that
When I says them lies you lay your head back
Ain't just looks, I love where your head at
Gorgeous girl, how often do you hear that?
Gotta be a lot, hustle never stop
Understand I'm no common man but I'm off block still
And I know BS you will not deal with
My mama told me I will feel like this one day, feel like this one day
Gotta know that one day will be Monday
Considering the fact that I met you Sunday
I think this every time we kiss
Still do

(Hook)
I'm the luckiest man in the world, I'm the luckiest man in the world
I'm the luckiest man in the world, I'm the luckiest man in the world
(I got you)
I'm the luckiest man in the world, I'm the luckiest man in the world
I'm the luckiest man in the world, I'm the luckiest man in the world
(I got you)
