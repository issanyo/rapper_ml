[Verse 1: Euroz]
Dreams of being the greatest of all time, that's what my mind is mad focused
I got a little son like the blinds is half-opened
Open my heart so I can finally stash hope in
Hoping this journey that smells women and cash row in
Where the blueprints at? Let me check y'all approach
The Resistance, it's apparent we the best, y'all should know
When your standards are high as ours, we expect y'all to boast
The city that never sleeps yet we slept on the most
I'm slightly stuck in my ways, it's so hard to change
These niggas sell their souls to make it, that's what it cost to gain
I've been a star in these streets like the Walk of Fame
But that mentality altered soon as them offers came
I was taught by experience, life was my mentor
M-O-T-F exceeds every album in stores
You niggas not ready for this game, that's what the bench for
And there's no doubt in my mind this rap shit's what I was meant for

[Hook]
I'm just tryin' to find a way
And I ain't got no time to waste
I'm staring to the eyes of fate
Dear destiny, name your time and place
See, I'm just tryin' to find a way
And I ain't got no time to waste (No!)
I'm staring to the eyes of fate
Dear destiny, name your time and place

[Verse 2: Euroz]
I put my problems on a scale then I questioned how they'd weigh out
I love my city though I focused on the way out
Do I stay or take the Lebron James route?
I never count the days, I'm making my days count
Thank God, He keeps increasing my blessings
Don't prepare me to these Freshman when I'm competing with legends
I'm competing with greats from Biggie to Pac
And for that reason, I'm the one that my city should watch
Forreal, something different I made 'em accept
If we talking 'bout Vegas, I convey it the best
These 15 minutes of fame, I'm making it stretch
So deposit your pride and pay your respect
I'm a prince yet they compare me to the kings
When you're truly determined, failure ain't as scary as it seems
Cheated on my fears, broke up with the doubts
And got engaged to hard work and now I'm marrying my dreams

[Hook]
I'm just tryin' to find a way
And I ain't got no time to waste
I'm staring to the eyes of fate
Dear destiny, name your time and place
See, I'm just tryin' to find a way
And I ain't got no time to waste (No!)
I'm staring to the eyes of fate
Dear destiny, name your time and place
