[Intro]
It’s just so really ridiculous
As crazy as this

[Verse 1]
I was in adidas way before yeezus
Euro two-seaters and diamond out pieces
My women call me toes like shoes I'm laced with game
Hit the champagne shop baby taste the rain
Baby taste the fame then taste the game
Mike miking this bread don’t erase the pain
From all the shit I seen growing up in the wild hood
Really from Compton I don’t say it cause it sound good
Then I kick back fly fly with the fatty
Lurking down the shaw yeah I cracked her at the rally’s
She stay downtown finna take her to the valley
She like nah fuck that baby hit it in the set

[Pre-Hook]
Cause I'm a ghetto fly nigga and she like that
Yeah she like that (she like that , she like that )
And she like that
I'm a ghetto fly nigga and she like that
(she like that , she like that )
Yeah she like that

[Hook]
No matter how much mother fuc**ing paper I make
Or how many mother fu**ing  chains I got
Said a prayer to the lord for every rule I break
But I'm ghetto to the grave that  know that can’t stop
Woah oh-ohhh, Woah oh-ohhh, Woah oh-ohhh
Yeah she like that
Woah oh-ohhh
Yeah she like that

[Verse 2]
LL with a west fresher than the rest
Women hear my voice and think sex, flex yes
Baby you should fuck with me quick
Diamond lane on that street luxury shit
Drunk on the dance floor I don’t fuck with the vape no more
I'm lying I'm still over there
But a got a pair with me and I'm freaking out
Inner me still wondering if the heat is on
I ain’t trippin' bro I ain’t trippin' I ain’t trippin'
Maybe if I was broke like y’all it’d be different
But it ain’t, but it ain’t cause we living like a mother fucker
Give her with the dick she wrap a rib around a mother fucker
Lighting up the grams while I'm peeling up this mother fucker
Trap on 83rd we maybe a killing out this mother fucker
One on 76th we was drill off that mother fucker
Quick switch it up cause I got this feeling bout this mother fucker

[Pre-Hook]
Cause I'm a ghetto fly nigga and she like that
Yeah she like that
And she like that
I'm a ghetto fly nigga and she like that
Yeah she like that

[Hook]
No matter how much mother fucking paper I make
Or how many mother fucking  chains I got
Said a prayer to the lord for every rule I break
But I'm ghetto to the grave that  know that can’t stop
Woah oh-ohhh
Yeah she like that
Woah oh-ohhh
Yeah she like that
