My bitch is _______
Why she’s worried?

Which 1, which 1?
Which 1 you workin’?
Which 1, which 1?
Which 1 you workin’?

Which 1, which 1?
Which 1 you workin’?
Which 1, which 1?
Which 1 you workin’?

[Verse 1]

I’ll take you home
And that’s for certain
I’ll pull up in the car
Like which one you’re workin’?
My real 30
Yeah when I’m workin’
You be at the market pay
This is a sushi call
Nigga I ain’t never landed
Why I got the truth for?
Me and Problem round and round
We got the shooter ball

I show you how to work the beat
10.000 that’s bargain shit
I’m sippin’ from a golden bottle
And I bargain bitch
All the Instagram going hell
Keep twerkin’ bitch

[Verse 2]
Dropping the undropped
Blowing loud drum
I give him valuable prices
He gets that loud life
Askin’ the shooters to clap
Like the crowd goes
This life shall move
Like the callies go
Money stay on track
That’s how we roll
Fire everything, I mean hell no
My bitch balls
Lisa Leslie, she’s a spark
Shoppin’ when the store closes
Call it after market
Let me, let me let me show you how I work a bitch
Have a strip naked
Make her ass work a bit
‘80s baby flexin’ on my Turkey sheets
Diamond lanes, hustle gang
What are you workin’ with?

Drop Bourbon
We swervin’
