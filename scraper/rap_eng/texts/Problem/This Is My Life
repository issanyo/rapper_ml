[Hook: Problem]
I do what I do, give a fuck how you move
You ain't gettin' it on your own you can't walk in my shoes, no!
This is my life, this is my life
Get high, drink drank, made a gang of cash
And all my bitches got a gang of ass off
This is my life, this is my life

[Verse 1: AD]
[?] you ain't livin' your life
Fumble with a couple mollies, never dealt with the white
Remember times I woke up stressed in the middle of the night
Then homie told me "Drop the pencil, now start killin' the mic"
Now these rappers all nervous
Same niggas used to be homies
Same niggas used to be hungry, man
All of these niggas's phony
I ain't doin' subliminals, niggas soundin' identical
Trynna blur me from blesses and I ain't even reached my pinnacle
Compton like Problem I have a lot of those
Used to call me ugly now a nigga got a lot of hoes
Bottle after bottle fuck my scholar need a lot to go
Rubbers on the ace, shit fuck, if she ain't fuckin' then she gotta go
Adios
Used to sleep on me now they bumpin' all my audio
And I don't see no competition
Not being cocky I just don't go time to listen
We winnin' my nigga

[Hook: Problem]
I do what I do, give a fuck how you move
You ain't gettin' it on your own you can't walk in my shoes, no!
This is my life, this is my life
Get high, drink drank, made a gang of cash
And all my bitches got a gang of ass off
This is my life, this is my life

[Verse 2: Problem]
Four baby mamas, five kids later
I'm still rich, you still a hater
Walkin' straight [?] and some phones in the pager
While y'all diamonds ain't clear like Patron with a chaser
Never needed favors from no nigga
Compton gorilla, dressed like a coke dealer
Lost put the coke and his nose like 'fuck with the white
I'm like no, shit, he like, " fuck it, this is my life"
So I'mma turn up, L-I-T 'till I R.I.P it
Eveyday I gotta G it cause we don't get to repeat it
Hundred mill I see it and if I believe it I can achieve it
If you need that weed, yo [?] I bet, my nigga, I can beat it
When I put your favorite song and I met that bitch
I didn't need it, all I did was fuck that bitch
And start actin' like I don't need it
Fuck that bargain, money talkin'
I'm feelin' like Charlie Sheen and Damon Wayans and his brothers
Diamond Lane motherfucka!

[Hook: Problem]
I do what I do, give a fuck how you move
You ain't gettin' it on your own you can't walk in my shoes, no!
This is my life, this is my life
Get high, drink drank, made a gang of cash
And all my bitches got a gang of ass off
This is my life, this is my life
