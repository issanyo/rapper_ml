[Verse 1: Problem]
Doin' 95 on the 15
Drive crazy like a nigga fifteen
High as fuck yeah I'm bout to O.D
Oh lord I don't wanna see the police
Cause nobody's home, I'm gone
Never O F F I'm on, talking nasty on my phone
She like what kinda drugs you on?
None
I'm just a guy who likes to have fun
And you seem like you wanna have none
So I'm done, Boop, talking to your ass
Let me call another bitch up
Damn I'm bout to crash, I almost ran into a pick up
You high? Raise yo hands this a motherfuckin' stick up

[Hook: Problem]
I dare you to move

I dare you to move
What kind of drugs you on motherfucker?
I dare you to move

[Verse 2: Problem]

Smoking a joint when I ride
That's what us winners do
Bitch don't be killing my vibe
Yo money short as an interlude
Boy you can't swim with a shark
Float 'fo I bite up your inner tube
Baby he fired, I am the man for the job
We can skip all the interviews
I'm a come over and enter you
Take it, take it, like you suppose to
Have us some more drinks and then we get naked
Getting that pussy, go postal, on me
Then hide right back in the Diamond Lane
Fuck, police pulled up beside me man
Hey man, I dare you to move
(Fuck me)
(Talking to ya bitch ass, yeah)
(Hey, shit go crazy)
She like what kinda drugs you on?
None
I'm just a guy who likes to have fun
And you seem like you wanna have none
So I'm done, boop, talking to your ass
Let me call another bitch up
Damn I'm bout to crash, almost ran into a pick up
You high? Raise yo hands this a motherfuckin' stick up

[Hook: Problem]
I dare you to move

What kind of drugs you on motherfucker?
I dare you to move
