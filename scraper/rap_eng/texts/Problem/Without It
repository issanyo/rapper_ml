[Verse 1 - AD]
Made runs without a plug, made hype without a deal
You niggas all fraud, made songs without the feel
Me without the mic is like Jordan without the rings
Stand on my own two, make moves without a team
Still run up on em if a nigga want them problems
Riding through the city, catch me sagging down [?]
With my music blasting, hands all on your baby mama
Y’all ain’t with the drama, y’all be talking to your honor, ahh!
I did it without it
They saying I’m next, couple niggas still doubting
Really from a set, little nigga I’m bout it
Comptown till the grave, every day I shout it
Had a dream, made a plan
Took my [?] like a man
Never salted anybody, all we talk about’s your friends
I ain’t shaking no hands, never hate on no man
When it’s all said and done, they gon say I did it without it

[Hook]
Without it [x8]

[Verse 2 - Bad Lucc]
You looking at a DLG
Tell that bitch I don’t need nothing but HBC
Town aboriginal, D O G
Where the homies move the rock like CP3
[?], whooping the bromo codes
Khakis and [?] with the cornrows locster
All ways on my toes, homie post on her ass
Bout to make a move I don’t fuck with the [?]
Nigga BL known to make the chirp go
They got a nigga stomped out in my first show
You better ask around, know a nigga burnt though
And ya squad ‘fore I put him in a hearse door
I’m from the era of Lil Clyde and Dove
East side nigga, never carding them [?]
I be a real nigga without the vouch nigga
Chalk a nigga out for the doubt
A real nigga without it

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Problem]
Compton paparazzi banging down Central
Instrumentals bang loud, presidential hanging out the window
Turnt, getting turnt, talk to the burnt homie
He get OT bread, he got a scarf on me
Ugly grind, whole crew got to shine
Long as wristwatch tick tocks it’s always money time
Never flip rock, move big blocks of wintertime
Told mama it’s good, we eating, dinnertime
No forks, no spoon, but I will eat your dime up
Knocker drawers on, getting hundred dollar lineups
Bitch, understand it
Call your bitch and get a room at the [?]
The boy rotate bitches like planet
Do my damage then a nigga vanish
The diamond like dolo, money coming fast
Better hold on, Richard [?]
Still the same nigga without it

[Hook]
