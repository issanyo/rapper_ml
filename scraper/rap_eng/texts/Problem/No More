I know I said that I wouldn't fuckin' with that bitch no more
But I did, but I did. Fuck it, shit
And I know I said that I wouldn't fuckin' with them drugs no more
But I did, but I did. Fuck it
I ain't stoppin' no more, I ain't stoppin' no more
I'mma do it 'till you niggas ain't watchin' no more
I ain't stoppin' no more, I ain't stoppin' no more
I'mma do it 'till you niggas ain't watchin' no more
Homie

[Verse 1]
I ain't listen no more, I ain't listen no more
Tell the Punk P.O. I ain't pissin' no more
Tell that bitch stop talkin' I ain't hit no more
And don't ask for no dick you ain't get no more
You ain't get no more, you ain't get no more
Baby pass me a lot of weed and don't hit it no more
Got the big head [?] till you fit no more
And I'mma be this way till that ass go broke
And it can't happen so


[Hook]
I know I said that I wouldn't fuckin' with that bitch no more
But I did, but I did. Fuck it, shit
And I know I said that I wouldn't fuckin' with them drugs no more
But I did, but I did. Fuck it
I ain't stoppin' no more, I ain't stoppin' no more
I'mma do it 'till you niggas ain't watchin' no more
I ain't stoppin' no more, I ain't stoppin' no more
I'mma do it 'till you niggas ain't watchin' no more

I'mma end up in a [?] in the mother suckers
It's bout to go down pass the chain to my lil mama


[Verse 2]

Tatted by the ribs, Diamond Lane celebrating the trip
Turn up all night then go pick up all of my kids
In the morning dady buy his kush got me in orbit
Bitch I dare your brother run up on me I ain't Norbit
You called me 20 times oh my God yeah I ignored this

Pockets all enormous with more tree than a forest

Fuck it them suckers I shoulda know like [?]
