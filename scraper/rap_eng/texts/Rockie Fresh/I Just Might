[Intro: Rockie Fresh]

Yeah, Rockie checking in..
Just might be one of the realist nigga to do this shit..
Fuck with me..yeah

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]

See I just might be a sleeper
I just might be a dream
I just might be a worker
I just might be the king
I might just pull up and smoke with you
Show you shit you ain't seen
I just might...
Motherfuckers better get it right
Show you what we living like
Look, it's crazy when you think about what could happen
So many ways we could look at it
Really ain't trying to be taken backwards
And I got no time for these new actors
Trying to get a role in this movie shit
In which I like to call my life
Or I just might be the next number one nigga
Now every moment I think twice
And not only that gotta think about price
Now about money but the cost of my life
Cause right now I mean something
It's a four one and my team coming
As long as Kels got me, Jigga me
Daley got me, I'm straight
Gertler gave me a couple thousand
Like young homie just wait
And I did that
I told momma that her kid back
And I'm going for everything
I be fucking bitches to the wedding ring
And I swear my wife gon be a queen
I just might take her to Rome
Just might count a cool 100 thousand
Right when I'm getting some dome
Like what the fuck am I on?
Man it's been a long time coming
But I'm still running
Trying to get straight to the top of this shit
Oh you think I be dropping this shit?
I promise i really got love for this shit
I got love for the fans
And I love taking pics
I got love for the bitches
That love doing dick
I got love for the money
That never will switch
I got love for the keys
And that's shout out to Meek
