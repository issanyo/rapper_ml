[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
These niggas never had a chance
All these bottles fucking up they plans
You the baddest out of all your friends
And all them bitches bad, please understand
But you got that shit, you know that shit
Start catching feelings when you throw that shit
And you moving like you wanna stay
It’s obvious you came to play, it’s something that you wanna say

[Bridge: Clare Maguire]
Meet me in the red sky, dance with me
Let the valley change you, let the night set you free
It’s dusk in desert, it’s heaven at the gates
You are my desire, you are my escape

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Now I’m a young smart nigga who coming through stupid fly
Wearing Bape but I can kill ‘em in a suit and tie
These niggas ain’t seen all the shit I’ve seen
Gone where I’ve gone, damn I be putting on
And that’s the very reason that I’m right here in your city
I can’t front, I’m happy you in here with me
I’m wanted by many, my pockets hold plenty
These APC’s held up by Fendi
Fresh nigga so you know I need a clean bitch
Who know I’m working ‘cause I wanna see my team rich
Time invested so she someone I could stunt with
Weed, she don’t fuck with but she could roll a blunt quick
Take me high, get me right into my zone
She know my time short but my money hella long
And when we in that bed, then we be going hella strong
When she on her way back home, she about to play this song
