[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm out here grinding, crib like King of Diamonds
You can catch me wearing (two chains), yeah I'm shining
With my nigga freshgoods, making sure them checks good
Gotta feed the homies, real players with respect would
These flashing lights is blinding, go get them a visor
Call the beat a gas leak and I set this shit on fire
And I don't fuck with liars, only tell the truth
Honesty is key and that is in and out the booth
Ball while they in the bleachers, so high they can't reach us
I dropped out of college and made more dough than my teachers
Definition of swagging, all off of my passion
One time for real niggas that's out there making it happen

[Hook]
A middle finger to them niggas who say that we ain't fly
We above all the drama cause we out here staying high
You gon' see a real nigga when you look me in the eye
I'm a leader in this bitch and homie I can tell you why
I'm on fire, you say you on fire, then nigga you a lie (x4)

[Verse 2]
Now while in deep thought, when I was high
Thought about the time that I
Wasn't picked to be a leader in the Chi
Just a young nigga, trying to get up out the jam
Me and niggas ain't know none of 'em, niggas like, "Damn"
People I ain't know trying to say they my fam
They see the jewels and they try to play Cam
Tell em they can dip if they ain't running with the set
And if you got money you can go and place a bet
I'll be in the sky cause riding on the jet
Rolling up the wet, I'm never getting seen
Because I got a name and a brand to protect
And all I ask for the people is respect
In return they're gon' get the same thing
They took a young player from the Chi off the bench
Now they're about to watch the whole game change
Remember my name, and understand that I'm a go-getter
Money maker, made a promise, I can't be no broke nigga
That would be a let-down, like unraveling a broke swisher
Me and success is a gold picture, you on the same then I fuck witcha

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I'm on a roll
They hating on the low
I get to chill with hella hoes
Yeah Rockie on a roll
Makin hella dough
Out here rocking hella shows
And the whole city knows

[Hook]
