[Verse 1]
I'm lost inside this rock and roll, run until I drift away
Info I don't need to know, some things I don't need to say
Organized greatness, I can't live my life in disarray
Sticking to my morals, understand some things will never sway
? in my left hand, doobie in my right hand
Some may say I'm wildin' out, but I'm just living life, man
Every day's a work day, but every night's exciting
Point, I get remembered like the Titans

[Bridge 1]
And I come from the other side, lot of fans, lot of pride
People tell me life's a trip, I say you ain't ever lie
Then they ask if I enjoy the ride
And this is just how I reply

[Hook]
I love it, I really love it, I swear I love it
I love it, I really love it, I fucking love it
Even when them dudes send hate, man, I love it
I love it when the fans can't wait, man, I love it

[Verse 2]
And we ain't looking back, we moving with a purpose
Life is much better when you find what the worth is
Gotta see things way deeper than the surface
Gotta take a chance, and that's even when you're nervous
A risk there's reward, you shoot you can score
Don't never be afraid to be search of something more
Yeah the great is what you gotta be
And people trying to see the future definitely should follow me

[Bridge 1 & Hook]

[Bridge 2]
From the Chi to NY, I fucking love it
From LA to VA, I fucking love it
From ATL to San Fran, I fucking love it
I'm living like the dam man, I fucking love it
From Toronto to UK, I fucking love it
From Australia to Norway, I fucking love it
And I get to do it my way, I fucking love it
I don't even care what y'all say, I fucking love it

[Bridge 1 & Hook]
