[Verse 1]
New man in your life, new pics on the gram
New ring on your hand, damn, I guess I know where I stand
I was hoping, I was hoping
Hoping maybe we would still have a chance
But now it's over, yeah it's over
You done went and found somebody else
How you gonna do me like that?
You know that we always came right back
You know we can never stay away too long
You know that we always find our way back home, yeah
So seeing you moved on, shit got me trippin', yeah
Stuck in my feelings, girl I need it I been reminiscin', oh yeah

[Chorus: Elhae]
Thinkin' back to the days you were mine, yeah
Circa 09, Circa 09' yeah
Do you remember the times?
Circa 09', Circa 09' yeah

[Verse 2: Elhae]
So maybe I should face it
Maybe I should get used to being without you baby
Swear to God I'm going crazy
Thought that you lovin' him, no no I can't take it, no
And honestly I'm wishin' me and him could trade places
I've been, I've been, I've been..

[Chorus: Elhae]
Thinkin' back to the days you were mine, yeah
Circa 09', Circa 09' yeah
Do you remember the times?
Circa 09', Circa 09' yeah

[Interlude]
"What are you doing here?"
"I know, I know, I know, just, I just feel that we need some time to, just to"
"We have to accept the way things are now and more importantly take responsibility for your actions, have a good night"

[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]
Summertime 09' used to pull up on you
In my momma car show you how a young nigga ride
Told you I'll be outside one day, with my shit
And a plane ticket, meet me on the runaway
I know you still thinkin' 'bout my old ways
We should throw it back like the old Js
'Cause I still got visions of your old place
When we watch movies then you used to go and roleplay
Damn, I remember when you cook for me
I remember when you did that look for me
Now a nigga gettin' money writin' stories understand
I just wish that you was there to keep the books for me
I need one more time, I know you still fine
You roll me a blunt and I pour you some wine
We used to trip but now I'm fallin' in line
Don't live in the past but I had to rewind

[Chorus: Elhae]
Thinkin' back to the days you were mine
Circa 09', Circa 09' yeah
Do you remember the times?
Circa 09', Circa 09' yeah
