[Rockie Fresh]
I got ‘em yelling aw shit, Rockie got another tape
Time in another zone, mind in another state
These niggas hella hate, I’m just trying to elevate
Fresher than some 409’s, rep that 708
Chi-Town nigga who whip until my clique is full
These niggas analytical, they need to be original
Problem is everybody focused on the next man
When they should be focused on them checks man
Yeah but I ain’t tripping ‘cause I’m always on my hustle
That’s gon’ me keep in the bank and always keep me out of trouble
That’s gon’ make my money double and triple off the tour soon
Balling like I’m on the court while staying out the courtroom
You’ll never hear the guy will drop, people never have me locked
But I stand behind my bars while we drive them foreign cars
And we specialize in doing the unthinkable
Salute to all my brothers in the Treated Crew, Rockie
