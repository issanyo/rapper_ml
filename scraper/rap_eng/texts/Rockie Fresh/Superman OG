[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
One of the freshest niggas they seen in a while
Anybody that disagree is just deep in denial
I be makin' my paper, that shit be makin' me smile
Niggas talkin' Deloreans, they just stealin' my style
In 2013 I plan to buy too many cars
I be chillin' in the sky, smokin' with the stars
I could change your life, shorty, I be goin' hard
Your nigga save big money like he at Menards
Do better, I know you like my new sweater
Young nigga, new cheddar, my team is rich forever
Understand I'm that nigga, I be good on the drama
Just give me head, I'm the bomb, more bomb than Israel or Gaza
I'm like Jordan at livin', at best you just Pippen
Like a gymnast I'm flippin' every digit I'm gettin'
I don't give no fuck, I'm in a league of my own
I have her roll up five and take 'em straight to the dome
I be bringin' hoes home, every night I hit the streets
I'm gettin' bread and makin' sure my niggas eat
Get it by the loaf, whether if it's white or wheat
You niggas Doctor Scholls, y'all about to see defeat
Watch how you walkin', watch how you talkin'
Watch who you say it to, you know these hoes be stalkin'
They just tryin' to listen, bitches on a mission
You see I'm different, look at the whips I'm whippin'
Look at this dough I'm gettin', look at this way I'm tippin'
Look at the countries I'm in, all my niggas trippin'
I got the team with me, the whole scene with me
I stand tall, no lean, but brought some green with me
Roll up, we don't give no fuck
Niggas sayin' his money low, so get your dough up
I could bring my bro up and my sister too
I take care of my fam, so I can't fuck with you
I got Steve on the mix, my flow so crack
So Ross be movin' them bricks, MMG we the shit
You see my wrist it be lit, you see my chain it be lit
You see that I'm blessed, too hot to be depressed
Goddammit I'm fresh, goddammit I'm next
I just get me some neck, then get right back to my checks
These people all on my dick since the big break
Fake fans, they ain't even got the mixtape
Fuck 'em
