(Chorus)
I'm ready,i'm ready, I'm ready
I think I found the one
I'm riding, you riding? cause we riding
Follow me to the sun
I'm ready, so ready, are you ready?
For whatever may come
Cause I'm ready, born ready, so ready
For whatever may come

(Verse)
I've been waiting for it
Staying patient for it
I just can't ignore it, no I can't ignore it
I've been waiting for it
Staying patient for it
Nah I can't ignore it, I just can't ignore it

It gets heavy, am I strong enough
It takes time, is this long enough
Cause I'm waiting for it
Staying patient for it
I just can't ignore it
Nah I just can't ignore it

(Chorus x1)

(Verse)
Could it be a drag, or could it be the swag
Or could it be you mad
I live the life that you never had
Tell me why you act like that
Cause you ain't' getting stacks like that
Yo bitch left yo broke ass but you can't get her back like that

Black man why you wanna see a nigga fail?
You know they wanna see us dead or in jail
We doing everything just to see the same
If they change us then how could we ever gonna change the game
I give a fuck about you lame niggas
Yall don't bang with us
Sometimes you can't save niggas
You know them caught in the way niggas

Ill buy a boat some day
Ill help em float some day
These niggas hope one day
The can get shit like me
I'm growing, its showing
This goes one way
They gonna know some day
They gonna know some day

(Chorus x2)

(Outro)
Stupid man in the window
I couldn't be addressed all my delight, over matter
I couldn't be addressed from what I liked, from what I gathered
I couldn't be addressed stupid man in the window
I couldn't be addressed

(Chorus) + Rockie over top
Yeah x 5
Way before the watch and chain
Way before they knew my name
I was riding, I was ready
Way before the watch and chain
Way before they knew my name
I was ready, i've been ready
Way be before all this fame
Way before the cars that came
I was ready, for whatever may come
