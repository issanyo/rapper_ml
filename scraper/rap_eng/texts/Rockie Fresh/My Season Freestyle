[Rockie Fresh]
Dog, it’s not a question, the homie Rockie Fresh got flows
I hit the club just to show ‘em that I got hoes
Ever since I got cold and the wrist got froze
Now I’m in the club, Nudie jeans and some bygoes
But no, a nigga not fly just ‘cause of my clothes
Oh how my mind grows to see me reaching my goals
Realizing I’m chose, milli from a micro, open to success
But something less, I got my mind closed
And it’s funny, I got the call, I got my spot set
From the phone booth to the DJ Booth dot net
Then I got your girl and afterward, she got wet
Had to wear goggles but I took it for a throttle
Varnish looking in my bottle, she thirsty so she sip this
Niggas can’t see me, I’m about to make a witness
Not with making friends, I’m more with making business
If that shit don’t make money, then that shit don’t make a difference
And because I make a difference, many are a fan of mine
Request me on the DJ Booth and they quick to stand in line
I been getting on and getting blown like a dandelion
Girls wanna get nailed and my watch is saying hammer time
Man, it’s all hands on me like a clock
So they finna blow me till a nigga reach the top
I’m all up in a sweater, y’all just chilling on the dock
And your shit wouldn’t sell if you threw it on a yacht
Boy, stop and yet they continue with the hating
I let these hoes tell like where I stay, where I vacation
Hid my new shit for a moment, they been waiting
Like I’m in the doctor’s office, I just had to make ‘em patient
Were y’all being patient? No, y’all not adjacent
And ain’t no other nigga take it far as I’mma take it
Yeah cuz love my charm like I’m hanging from they bracelet
Rappers get ate like I’m on my Johnny Case yeah
I just gotta make it, they love what I’m on
That’s why they wanna kick it like Dragonfly Jones
Order Dominoes and they’ll later play bones
I slam ‘em on the table, spit that game because I’m able
I am Rockie and I am able, hanging with the winners
And when I see money, then I’m always thinking dinner
Why? Because I’m eating, never been beaten
They think I’m off the spice rack ‘cause it is my season, gone
