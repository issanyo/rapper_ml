[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Nice denim, nice women
Yeah she know that I’m quite winnin
This gon come at the right time, I’m ridin' round and I’m tryna get it
First whip was a Audi coupe
Drive that shit like a Honda Civic
One life, I’m tryna live it
That Hennessy is in my liver
Usually I don’t drink but when I do it’s so exquisite
I would probably be a bigger rapper if I would do, something different
But it’s no hype, it’s on sight
I’d rather rap about my life
No judging, girl do yo thing
Why you worried bout what I think?
I be rockin' them ripped up jeans
I be movin' round with my team
It’s good to have different options, got different kicks from different shopping
Bound to get it, that ain’t no option
We gotta do it, put it all in music
Peas and Carrots, yea we gon stay
That’s my brand like Frito Lay

[Verse 2]
Worried bout all the places we go, vacation in Rio
I be in my speedos, everything wavy
Like a torpedo, baby girl date me
Then she gotta let go
Way I’ve been lately, I be getting checks tho
All up inside er, tryna get er wet tho
Tryna see a rider like she from the set though
This girl’s on the board
I don’t even sweat her, already think I love her
She could be a mother
I’d never slut her you can even have a brother
Call me young papa, she my sole survivor
We doin improvs, just eatin on pasta
I been in them Pumas and we do them pradas
They be tryna follow but am I role model?
When she in the room she just spread it like a rumor
I give it to her every time she need the pounding
Just gotta holler

[Hook]
I wanna be alone with yo girl
You know I’ll bring that money home to you girl
Just keep it true, do what you do with your world
I’mma do me and we gon take over the world
Ain't got no problems
This a song for you girl
Uh yea I got it, we get known on all over the world
If you tryna ride we gon take over the world
You tryna ride we gon take over the world
If she gon ride we gon take over the world

[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]
Everybody wants something from me
These rap niggas want a deal from me
These bad bitches want a feel from me
I’m young, eatin, I’m still hungry
Me and Casey got big dreams, like ridin round in whatever coupe
Like we ain’t worried bout shaped dreams, game dirty, we stay clean
Tryna see what this life brings
Through all the bullshit that I've seen
The good times, the bad times
You don’t get shit when you out here lyin
You can see me and a nigga flyin
On a different plane and a different night
You look at me like I’m movin white
God got me all in the light
The wrist shining, the neck shining
It’s good timing, I’m still finding
Ways to get more motherfuckin money
Niggas wanna learn, you can learn something from me
I’m a boss in my own right
Bitch I can go and change yo whole life
What you want? I can cop that
You wanna do the hard top or the top back?
Gave young niggas choice
And we ain’t going back to being broke
And when they see a nigga drown by the flow
Now I’m laid in the shade, getting paid while I smoke
And I’mma pass it if you open, don’t talk, keep rollin'
Stay high above all, like fuck it we ball and it’s so well spoken
Dead presidents speak for me, good girls be some freaks for me
Got a new technique and it’s so unique, man the flow antique
The album coming pray for the leak
If he sayin he high then he tweaked
With the new world he coulda bought a Jeep
And you know it’s all love when you see me in the streets
You know I wanna be alone with you girl
Swear I’ll bring that money home to you girl
These niggas weak, I’m smoking strong wit you girl
No bongs wit you girl

[Hook]
