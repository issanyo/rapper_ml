[Intro: Rockie]
Yea yea
Father forgive em for these niggas know not what they do
Father forgive em for these niggas know not what they do

[Hook: Rockie]
My niggas hustled, then we made it through
You tried to tell em but they act like they ain’t have a clue
Father forgive em for these niggas know not what they do
Father forgive em for these niggas know not what they do

[Verse: Rockie]
Damn, this shit feel like I’m in outter space
Surviving when I keep my pace, I’m cruising, this is not a race
Feeling like my nigga Meek, these dreams the only thing I chase
Been here for a minute, a lot of people just arriving late
My key is low, my blunt bangin like a 808
Shit can make Usain Bolt feel out of shape
Ricky love the fans, you just see he dropped another tape
I was on Green Street, buying out all the Bape
Mercy me, I could’ve did better on that mercy beat
But still pushed the mercy when I travel through Miami streets
So elite, $800 Jordans on my feet
My team is on a winning streak, we the ones to beat

[Hook]

[Verse: Rockie]
They see me pull up on that scene clean
My chick thick and my clique full of young kings
The word around is we looking like The Dream-Team
The word around is we looking like The Dream-Team
We got them gold medals, and Lamborghini pedals
That all-gold Rollie and diamonds in the bezel
We on another level, bunch of rich ass rebels
And ever since we touch the riches we won’t never let go
I hear you talkin shit, but what’s the fuckin purpose?
Does it make you rich? Well, what’s the fuckin purpose?
These bitches dirty and I’m tired, where’s the damn detergent?
We came a long way from the bottom, that’s for fuckin certain
That’s cuz a nigga workin

[Hook]
