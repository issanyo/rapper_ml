[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
Just trying to stay focused and get to the money
Basic, I know but it's working out for me
At this point in my life, ain't many I trust
You running my pace get left in the dust
And you thinking about switching it up
I'm coming through in the clutch
Only hundreds I touch
You ain't been laughing enough
You might think be joking when I say "What happened to us?"
But I feel like you met me before
I feel like you tried to forget but you missing me more
This pressure just taking you low
And I'm on the way to the door
Hope you ready to go
Cuz I'm ready to go

[Hook: Rockie Fresh]
You should know I'm on the move
You should know I'm with the winners
Surely I can promise that we'll never lose
You say you want different things
Want to try and change the scene
I just know you want to leave
And you know that I'm..
Down to roll, are you coming? (x8)

[Verse: Rockie Fresh]
See I only speak on the facts
If you leave with me, chances are you won't want to go back
You might be doing too much
You might be tripping or you might be falling
They don't know I'm the one
Ain't no step on the bricks
Stoop to my level
I'm low key as shit
And when they get to jumping
I know it's a hit
But my circle too small
Ain't no way they could fit
But you, you got a space
You want a vacation from everything fake
I need a new house by a beach or lake
Stop surfing the net and get lost in this wake
Get on my page
All of these niggas is lame
All of these niggas run game
That's how you feel
Me and them are not the same
These hoes should stay in they lane
That's how you feel
And judging by how you react to me
You know it's real and ain't ever no act with me
You go then you gotta come back to me
Spend all these rack and they always come back to me

[Hook: Rockie Fresh]
You should know I'm on the move
You should know I'm with the winners
Surely I can promise that we'll never lose
You say you want different things
Want to try and change the scene
I just know you want to leave
And you know that I'm..
Down to roll, are you coming? (x8)

See I only speak on the facts
If you leave with me, chances are you won't want to go back
You might be doing too much
You might be tripping or you might be falling in love
You might be tripping or you might be falling in love
Said you might be tripping or might be falling in love
You might be tripping or you might be falling in love
