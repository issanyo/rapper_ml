There's a reason why we made it
Me and Rockie Fresh work hard and just take it
One day at a time, one day at a time
One day at a time, one day at a...Let's do it

Hook:
It's hard not to change when you get a bit of fame
I'm still the same as when I started it will never change
Still light years ahead they aren't in my lane
Still making these moves and now they know my name
I'm on the grind and I always do that overtime
So step aside and see a star that is about to shine
Life can change real fast at any given time
We never stressing we just take it one day at a time

[Verse 1: Wem]
Feels like I'm homesick for a place that I haven't been
Still haven't taken the time out to pause to see what's happening
I know I can do anything as long as I believe
Never let another man tell me what I can achieve
And I'm not trying to please any body but myself
I keep doing my thing expand my mind and my wealth
And I can't do those 9 to 5 so I choose to create
Working hard til one day each verse is 95k
They recognize that I'm busy I'm just following my dreams
Tryna to get my fare share off these million dollar schemes
Nothing's like what it seems so you gotta be prepared
Be yourself and do your thing until no one else compares
Life is gunna test you, make sure that you got pencil
Use your brain for making art but stay away from fucking stencils
With this brain in my head I'm still the same person
And I quit living my life you wanted and to me it's fucking worth it

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
I'm on my grind, god damn I'm on my grind
In some thousand dollar sneakers that are hard to find
Blowing, smoking, got us choking we be out our minds
Niggas know I'm getting money for the hundredth time
Routine, so clean
My real life, what yall dream
Niggas hating on me what the fuck do yall mean
Niggas probably hating cause they ain't on my team, yeah
We on that forward movement
Niggas losing, I'm out here choosing what these bitches doing
While we cruising, they know I'm going to the top
Super fly riding in the new car with the doors straight up
Butterfly, butterfly, damn I'm high
Niggas always question on my flow I ask em why, cause it's
Making me paper I'm hollering later
This nigga's high as skyscrapers, nigga I'm getting paper I'm gone
