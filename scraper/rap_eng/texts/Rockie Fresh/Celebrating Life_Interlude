Celebrating life, we sip champagne

She be rockin with it, she with the campaign
She don’t talk about it, she do the damn thing

Celebrating life, we sip champagne

From out of town, I’m coming home, I’m get straight to the paper
Last night was in the studio next to Anita Baker
We came far, them memories faded, I’m seein hella faces
She pledging for it, this peas and carrots, alpha omega
Baby girl, she drop it low for these bands and shake it
I’m getting money, I’m dodging haters, they mad I’m tryna make it
This PNC the squad yeah, roll with us or get rolled on
Where I come from they get it done, all we know is it go hard
West side, my top down, I’m going to the store y'all
Niggas try to get in my way, we gon have to bogart
It’s a celebration of real niggas being them self
Said you’re good yourself but y'all do this shit well
Do it to the death, I don't do it for my health
I’ll be…

Damn, a nigga faded forever
Look at the squad, see all my niggas made it together
I’m going hard cause you know being broke is a never
I’m touching work and right now I ain’t got time to text you
My Rollie over the horn as I pull up at the light
And tonight I done bought a couple bitches a flight
See yall know where’s the money homie, fuck that end of em tight
And I live every fuckin day like it’s the end of my life
See I might holler at a bitch, see what her energy like
Some hoes be frontin and they be on you, remember me right
No no ho ho I’m so forgetful, I don’t remember faces
Unless they green faces, young Rockie getting paper yeah
