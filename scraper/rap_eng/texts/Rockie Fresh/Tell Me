[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]

You know a few people that know me
Im not your man but I'm more than a homie
I love when you come put it on me
I love to come through every time that you lonely, I know that Im needed
You're starting to act different your nigga can see it
If he know what you did when you do it i promise he wouldn't believe it
But that's none of his business
And our business is pleasure
The way that i'm touchin' you, fuckin' you, I got you down for whatever
Hand on the bible, I can't say I Love you but I think I like you
You say you want someone beside you but I think Im better behind you

[Hook: Rockie Fresh]

Yeah
And I'm never gon' front
I get whatever you want
You just gotta tell me, you just gotta tell me
You just gotta tell me, you just gotta tell me

Yeah
And you know Im never gon' front
I go and get what you want
You just gotta tell me, you just gotta tell me
You just gotta tell me, you just gotta tell me
[?]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Yeah
I got an old soul
So most bitches my age be too young for me
These younger girls be too dumb for me
But these cool chicks wanna learn from me
I get deep inside put 10 on their mind and O in their heart
Knowledge is power, you giving me brains so you playing it smart
The answers to all of your test, Help you zip up the back of your dress
I Kiss on your neck
I call you my bitch when I hit it, but still its respect
I never get caught in my feelings, I hope that you never get scared of me
You know Ima star, I know who we are and I know who we'll never be

[Hook: Rockie Fresh]

Yeah
And I'm never gon' front
I get whatever you want
You just gotta tell me, You just gotta tell me
You just gotta tell me, You just gotta tell me

Yeah
And you know i'm never gon' front
I go and get what you want
You just gotta tell me, You just gotta tell me
You just gotta tell me, You just gotta tell me
