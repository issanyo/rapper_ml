[Verse 1: Hit Boy]
Look, it’s that towel under the door wrap
Finding notices on the floor mats
Five Hundred dollar smoking fines
Can’t let it blow my high
Cause I really can’t afford that
Versatility’s what we get for nigga
Check my Wiki nigga I’m jiggy nigga
And I’ve been eating good for a minute
They just starting to get it
I stay hungry like Twista's sister
We never know what tomorrow holds
So I’m just in Toronto with Toronto hoes
Ridding with the city’s Obama, we mayback reclining
My thoughts is I need higher goals [money]

And really I got a new agenda
I heat it up, you niggers just little December
I’m leaving dust like Olympian track runners
Putting up mad numbers you niggers missing like bad jumpers
I’m in America, where American bitches
On Italian leather so nigga watch where you sitting
Know this shit reminiscing of all the shit that you grew up on
Wishing that you could call up on me when you need a hit and shit
I’m busting at you busta may fucking lames
Rolling some realto nigga steady screaming fuck a fade

I E to N nigga
My team for the win nigga
Riley woulda been said it
You niggas is fucking gay
Pause

There’s no offense to the Os, but I got more haters
Than I got hoes [JK]
I just lied on that line before
You know these ladies treat me like bicycle [ride out]

And I’m just smashing on the critics with a vengeance
Fuck you feelings and opinions niggers talk before they listen
That’s that big shit, that's that intentional cynical
Fuck niggers get off my genitals
Before I vcut back and let it loose
I’m over the top and I’m ready to shoot

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
I just wish that I coulda appeared on Entourage
Smoked out on Oprah's couch, chilling with my moms
I’m blowing up tho so every thing I do is bomb
Every time I cruise I turn a fool into a peep in tom
And Jerry Sandusky wouldn't even feel these boys
Why? because his pussy is weak
You see it every time you meet
It’s lights camera action
Any time that Rockie speak
They are ass and your boys are lost like my cheeks
And me: I stay above parks
See how I got so high
That my hit my head on Mars
And this bitch say her man not fan of stars
He say my shit be weak
I got candy bars
But her fingers still stay on my dick
Betwixt, she saw the whip and fell in love with the kid
So cat eyes every time she gotta look at the shine
Pay day when I finish I get back to my grind
I got a beautiful mind
The song is racing and I'm bout to take another lap
Stating real facts like a mother fucking Snapples cap
Got the Juice, 2Pac is back
Purified it isn't tap
Keep it true
Go to Fiji, let the homies steal the map
I’m stumbling into honeys
While I’m sipping liquor
I get paid to ride kicks
I ain't got a kicker
I got these lames writing paragraphs under pictures
A lot of rappers sensitive so I don't fuck with niggers
But if you real I got a blunt on me
Unh
And I'mma pass it if you want to
Unh
Cause somewhere in America
Amanda Bynes still smoking
