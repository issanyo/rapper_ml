[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]

I met you a few years back and you still one hundred
And one hundred percent of the time
You should know you gon' be good if you're mine
Your Ex always lying and he blocking your shine
He told you to change but I think that you're fine
Come get with the team, I'mma treat you like a queen
Show you what them niggas can't do
I promise I'm grateful
And right now (I ain't complaining)
I fuck with the way that you move
I'm with you it feels like I'm chilling with two
Damn, I can fulfill every dream
Show you that this life is more than it seems
And the way that you're doing your thing
You can make rap niggas sing
And it sounds like

[Hook]

(Sample)

And I'm telling you please don't change
I want your joy, I want your pain
I want your sun, I want your rain

Baby, please don't change
Might change my car
Might change my house
But know my love gon' stay the same

Baby, please don't change
Don't switch up
Cause that could be the end for us
And I don't really want to see the end of us

So please don't change
I like you just the way you are
The world don't know but you're a star

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]

I know you got work and you're dealing with classes
And most men that you meet are to immature
And they can't handle your passion
So when you're alone you imagine what it would be like
To be with somebody that's on your level
But can show you how your levels
Come through with something special
You know you deserve it you never settle
I like how you stick to your rules and your vision
I can relate because I am no different
I'm locked in my ways like my mind is a prison
And it's crazy how I put my life in a sentence
Try to stay humble when people say fuck you
So gon' be yourself shawty stunt how you want to
And the way you be doing your thing
You can make rap niggas sing
And it sounds like

And I'm telling you please don't change

Baby, please don't change

Might change my house
But know my love gon' stay the same

Baby, please don't change
Don't switch up
Cause that could be the end for us
And I don't really want to see the end of us

So please don't change
I like you just the way you are
The world don't know but you're a star
