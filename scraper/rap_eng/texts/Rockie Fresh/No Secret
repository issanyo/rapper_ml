[Intro: Oktane]
Imma do this one time
Ion run around bruh...
Let's make this quick
Imma make this bitch jump too
All off memory
Here we go

[Verse 1: Oktane]
Uhh Aight Look
Let me get my rain man
Got me doing the rain dance
That ain't rain boy, that's money
Only piece of paper make ya act funny
Only piece of paper that make the rats want me
The kinda paper make a hater do his job I'm stuntin'
Make the big booty whop out hundreds
And when the beat drop
Make their heads drop for me, let's do it!
Fuck all that paper man, I'm just grindin'
Tryna get it for family (Ya got it, ya copy)
I ain't Mexican and she ain't Mexican
But she at the spot and she callin' me "Papi"
I said "Mexican" two Eses Guestin' (Hehe, damn hol' up)
Cause she said "Papi the hottest"
I've been waiting for the rock now I got it
Now they wanna know the size of my wallet
Ask me "How it go?" I say "I  can't call it."
When I know I go behind the back and ballin'
Everybody callin' askin' for features
And I'll do all them shits
I'm happy to be here
I don't mind gettin' paid to eat ya beats
And make a couple "K" right in time for the weekend
Niggas wouldn't get the game, so we peeped it
And now we the fuckin' best and that ain't no secret

[Hook: Audio Push]
Shit ain't no secret (Shit ain't no secret)
It ain't no secret (It ain't no secret)
We don't fuck wit y'all boys
This shit ain't no secret (This shit ain't no secret)
And that's the way we gon' keep it (And that's the way we gon')
And that's the way we gon' keep it (And that's the way we gon')

[Verse 2: Price]
Look, bow boy got bars like Museum
All y'all rappers sound the same, y'all need a new plan
"Who the plug?", We the plug
Hear the crew chant
I'm number 1, but I'll be second with my two fam
Paper on paper, Him look like a newsstand
Remember when I use to steal my Mama's food stamps
Now these girls love me
Got two Cams, two Sams
All different colors like a beak upon a Toucan
You can get kicked to the door like Martin used to do Pam
See this one for the true fans
From the Era where we used to throw them two hands (Mmm)
Have you rappers looking like soup cans
Sittin' on the shelf, needin' help
Meanwhile we the Hardy Boyz with the belt
On the turnbuckle
Didn't have to earn hustle, we just had it automatic
We was destined for the wealth
Lord help
Cause they praying on me (Cause they praying on me)
And I'm just praying that somebody be out there praying for me
Keep them away from me (Lord keep them away)
Aye city look, if you have it, keep a space for me please
I've been on my knees
I've been at war with new devils
My mama told me that it's new devils at new levels
She also said I was special since I was riding on Mongoose pedals
And that's the reason I ain't gon' settle

[Hook: Audio Push]
Shit ain't no secret (Shit ain't no secret)
It ain't no secret (It ain't no secret)
We don't fuck wit y'all boys
This shit ain't no secret (This shit ain't no secret)
And that's the way we gon' keep it (And that's the way we gon')
And that's the way we gon' keep it (And that's the way we gon')

[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]
Right now, I ain't got time to be leanin'
I tell you to do it, know that I mean it
Don't get confused who the team is, Maybach forever
But I'll pull yo bitch in a Prius
She on her way to come see us
I let her get high, but I say on the low "She should keep it"
She went to tell all of her homies
And now they all on me, so it ain't no way it's a secret
We met in LA over summer
She gave top 'fore she gave me her number
You know she A runner
Get on the track, do the same
Rockie be ballin' I give em' that game
I'm Audio Pushin' the limit
Startin' to feel healthy
Pockets full on lettuce and spinach
I Might just go open a salad bar
I pull up in the wildest car
Yea Rockie a fuckin' star
With the shit like it's Amistad
Imma boss, you could get a job
I got the door, don't you touch the knob
Turnin' that shit, it could be a prob
You could meet the Mob
I could make a call, cause I'm in charge
Young Rockie don't catch the charge
I ain't never gotta fetch em' y'all
Cause I'm getting money in the Tesla charged (Hahaha)

[Hook: Audio Push]
Shit ain't no secret (Shit ain't no secret)
It ain't no secret (It ain't no secret)
We don't fuck wit y'all boys
This shit ain't no secret (This shit ain't no secret)
And that's the way we gon' keep it (And that's the way we gon')
And that's the way we gon' keep it (And that's the way we gon')
Shit ain't no secret (Shit ain't no secret)
It ain't no secret (It ain't no secret)
We don't fuck wit y'all boys
This shit ain't no secret (This shit ain't no secret)
And that's the way we gon' keep it (And that's the way we gon')
And that's the way we gon' keep it (And that's the way we gon')

[Bridge: Audio Push & Rockie Fresh]
Niggas all know we deep in this bitch (Say that, say that)
I'm Reppin' my squad (Say that, say that)
You know who I'm wit (Say that, say that)
My niggas go hard (Say that, say that)
