[Chorus 1: Rockie Fresh]
The lights will lead you there
There’s no better life than this, I swear

[Chorus 2: Trey Coachman]
Take care ‘cause these lights will lead you
No sleep this life will bleed you
Ball ‘till you fall they’ll feel you
No worries fingerprints burn and they’ll leave you

[Verse 1: Trey Coachman]
Blind to their ways
But you still accept and respect their long days
Collect and collect the poison pay
And spend it in ways you never taught
But did you catch yourself that you were caught
In deep debt, to make yourself love this life
But you break yourself with your wrong right
Don’t put up the fight
These mitches don’t give a rats blast for you darling
Do your best I know you will then you will be spalding

[Chorus 1: Rockie Fresh]
The lights will lead you there
There’s no better life than this, I swear

[Chorus 2: Trey Coachman]
Take care ‘cause these lights will lead you
No sleep this life will bleed you
Ball ‘till you fall they’ll feel you
No worries fingerprints burn and they’ll leave you

[Verse 2: Trey Coachman]
This place manipulates and continues to wait
For new innocent bait to take in and reshape
Engulf into news accommodations in your vicinity
I know drugs will never be the problem you see
This hectic lifestyle is the drug
You will want more and more
No tolerance I command
You gotta know I’m happy and terrified
I already apologized
I don’t care for fame
I demand to be acknowledged
College was fun, I can see it in your eyes
Now it's time for the real world
Yeah what we hear every week
Promise me you’ll be strong even when you’ll feel so weak
Go ahead take a seat

[Chorus 1: Rockie Fresh]
The lights will lead you there
There’s no better life than this, I swear
The lights will lead you there
There’s no better life than this, I swear

[Verse 3: Trey Coachman]
Trey this is cray
What you wanna rap dance and inspire?
Or is this you trying to stand out again?
Why you holding me back more than my momma?
Like tomorrow I’m gonna go meet Osama?
Stop tripping
I got this and I know this it's no intermediate
But any challenge I’m going for I’m a complete it
I mean it so chill
You know me more than I ever will

[Chorus 1: Rockie Fresh]
The lights will lead you there (The lights are lies)
There’s no better life than this, I swear
There’s no better life than this, I swear
