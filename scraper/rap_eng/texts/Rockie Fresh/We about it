Chorus:
Say we about it, tell ‘em we about it
And niggas say you get it like me?
I doubt it!
All about their money, man
I can’t leave home without it
And we talk it cause we live it
Yeah, we really be about it!
Say we about it, we really be about it
And niggas say you get it like me
I doubt it!
All about their money, man
I can’t leave home without it
And we talk it cause we live it
Yeah, we really be about it!

Say we about it
Tell ‘em we about it
I’m committed to commission, I collect it, then I count it!
And a lot of niggas down it
But it’s what the bitches’ down with
Looking for the next, about the Chi
I think you find it!
You can keep on searching, but won’t find no nigga realer
Just bout me a new Audi, put it fresh about the dealer
Now yo ho be tryin to roll
Cause I’m flying, smoking killa
Cause my chain be black and yellow
Not from Pittsburgh, but I Steel-ah
And I'm mackin like Casilla, I got Cardo on the beat bitch
Got the fans waving, every show will make you sea sick
Last season niggas salty cause my pockets deep bitch
Hating on me all seven days on some weak shit
We get whatever you want, no Rockie gotcha
I’m the truth, these niggas lions just like Mufasa
Show stopper,so proper in that Bapin shit
I got it early, while you niggas on the waitin list

Say we about it, tell ‘em we about it
And niggas say you get it like me?
I doubt it!
All about their money, man
I can’t leave home without it
And we talk it cause we live it
Yeah, we really be about it!
Say we about it, we really be about it
And niggas say you get it like me
I doubt it!
All about their money, man
I can’t leave home without it
And we talk it cause we live it
Yeah, we really be about it!

We love risk, so it’s only right we respect hustlers
We will like hate, haters and we check lovers!
Cali trees enjoy and threes, give me my best hovers
Man, I’m walking on these nigga, they’re my step brothers
Chick cuff us and hoes love us, cause we give them space
Never get too comfortable, cause anyone can get replaced
She with me, she smoke for free, ya'll do them expensive dates
Sexing while I’m flexing
Think your swag might need to hit the weights
See this pimpin' from afar, you gon get your squint on
Pull up in that old school, bitch I think I’m Vince Vaughn
After she got through wit me, she had to get her limp on
Before me it went wrong, I got off, now it’s on
I’m bent on smashing it, dashing it, ashing it, passing, bring the cash in
But that’s all after the rapping
Making it happen,If I shoot it then you can count it
Money surrounded , cause this young nigga about it. Yeeah!

Chorus: (x2)
Say we about it, tell ‘em we about it
And niggas say you get it like me?
I doubt it!
All about their money, man
I can’t leave home without it
And we talk it cause we live it
Yeah, we really be about it!
Say we about it, we really be about it
And nig say you get it like me
I doubt it!
All about their money, man
I can’t leave home without it
And we talk it cause we live it
Yeah, we really be about it!
