[Hook: Casey Veggies & Rockie Fresh]
Gold watch, gold chain, pretty chick, designer frame
Peas & Carrots, MMG,
Girls wanna be a friend of me
Then she feeling my energy
She feeding off of my energy
She fell in love with me energy
Fell in love with my energy
Gold watch, gold chain, pretty chick, designer frame
Chi-Town to LA, girls wanna be a friend of me
Then she feeling my energy
She feeding off of my energy
She fell in love with me energy
Fell in love with my energy

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
My pajamas be fresher than these niggas club shit
I be on that I don’t give a fuck about your buzz shit
I be smoking on that weed, it’s really not a drug quit
Shawty feeling my energy, I’m who she fell in love with
Have tumblr bitches, but I never name drop
None of my bitches
I got love for my bitches
Got some ones that do dishes
Got some ones that grant wishes
I got someones that give me money, that get from you niggas
True player, never hater, I got love for the game
Gotta shout out my nigga Casey, we hustle the same
Gotta shout out to all the fans cause the love is all the same
Ducking and dodging all the fake shit the anything lay
I went from being broke to fuck it I’m boarding the plane
Flooding the market while I’m watching it go down the drain
We both seein things we ain’t think we would see
MMG, PNC, what you thought it would be

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
This empire, to a king
A lame shit intervene, in the back on the scene
Get raps, it was a dream
Can’t front, it was me know when you popped it
Did drops spins
