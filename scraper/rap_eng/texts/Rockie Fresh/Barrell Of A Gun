[Intro]
In the barrel of a gun
In the barrel of a gun

[Verse 1]
Swagger, the newest nigga, I’m winnin
This is just the genesis, homey it’s the beginning
I’m travelling round the world and I’m getting pain with my crew
It’s a lot of people wondering why I do what I do
When I think about my mother who put your boy through summer school
When I was failing classes, waiting kiss these teachers’ ass
And I think about my pops who worked that 5 to 5
On the nights I should’ve died just to keep the dream alive
Now I’m standing here with 20 gold chains, I never run
Try to harm either
You gon have to meet the barrel of a gun

[Bridge]
You only got one shot
You only got one shot
You only got one shot
Don’t fuck it up, yea

[Hook]
When you get your shot, you better take it nigga
When you get your shot, you better take it nigga
‘Cause I will take mine and I will not miss
I’mma take mine, homey watch this

[Verse 2]
A lot of these rappers be out here wailin
Out here talkin all violent, I prefer to move silent
I know I’m on fire, but ain’t nobody flyer
These niggas say they hustle when they life is like the wire
Well my shit a little different, I’m living like Breaking Bad
I got them white boys cooking up in the lab
And we’ll see our pears, we only see the legends
I rarely talk guns, my ind is more a weapon
I’m murdering these rappers, going hard in every session
And my money got it coming, faster than a bullet from…

[Bridge] + [Hook]
