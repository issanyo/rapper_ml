(Verse)
I’m rolling up, I’m twisting up
I’m lighting up, I’m bout to bang
Got my mind on the place I came
And I promised to never change
Got the day coming, night falling
And these haters just keep calling
I don’t answer, they keep calling
I said fuck it, I keep balling
And kept searchin, finally found it
I remember when niggas doubted
When they tried to clown it
Stay the fuck from 'round it
My back too, and I’m never frontin
Money gone keep comin
So just holla if you need something
I said holla if you need something

(Chorus)
You never know, you never know, you never know
See when the night goes, see when the lights glow
I said you never know, you never know, you never know
See when the night goes, see when the lights glow
Trust me, you never know, you never know, you never know
See when the night goes, see when the lights glow
I said you never know, you never know, you never know
See when the night goes, see when the lights glow
See when the lights glow

(Verse)
Driving down the highway of life
Staying patient tryna get it right
These niggas talkin they ain't living right
These niggas talkin, you keep living life
Tell them keep talking, keep stacking
They ain’t like it, faith have it
Thank God that you make magic
Thank God that you make magic
Keep pushing, keep climbing
It’s all bout timing
You just gotta keep running
You just gotta keep running
When the night hits and the rain falls
We just grind til the morning
We just gotta keep rolling
Holler if you need something

(Chorus)
You never know, you never know, you never know
See when the night goes, see when the lights glow
I said you never know, you never know, you never know
See when the night goes, see when the lights glow
Trust me, you never know, you never know, you never know
See when the night goes, see when the lights glow
I said you never know, you never know, you never know
See when the night goes, see when the lights glow
See when the lights glow
