[Hook: D-SIK]
Everybody talking ‘bout how long I’m gonna last here
As if I hadn’t already made that clear
Way too many people standing round me
That before I didn’t have here
Funny how the money make 'em act weird
Now shit is looking scary
Lot of people wear masks here
There’s snakes in the grass here
You gotta watch your backs here
They hate you on the come up
But they love you when the cash clears
Everyone’s a friend now
But I gotta ask you
Where were you last year

[Verse 1: D-SIK]
Yeah, people make me uncomfortable
If you ain’t feeding financing or fucking me
Then I really don’t fuck with you
If you ain’t fans or family
Then I probably got no love for you
Get right or get left
When it comes down to it, it’s up to you
I remember you was talking down on me
I couldn’t wait to stunt on you
Now I'm rooftop of the W, like what a view
And these bitches love the crew
So everywhere I go you know they coming too
The youngest motherfuckers
Walking into Ruth’s Chris
In some ripped jeans and Supreme
We really couldn’t give 2 shits
2 racks on a new fit, shit is too lit
Balenciagas on my feet
Fuck it, if the shoe fits
Young and I’m ruthless
Yeah bitch I’m shining like Kubrick
I see you try, but you lying
We know your diamonds are cubic
We know your followings paid for
No one playing your music
I’m out in Cali making way more
That can't be disputed

Where were you last year?
Yeah where were you last year?
Where were you last year?
Where were you last year?
Yeah where were you last year?

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Look
They was sleeping on me last year
That's why I had to turn up
And make this year a cash year
And my niggas running shit
So you can't get a pass here
Make sure you light another blunt
When the smoke clear
Yeah, you don't know me
But you heard about me
I'm a fly nigga
Keep a couple birds around me
I was turning up
My niggas bottles in the club (Stuntin')
Bitches fucking with us
So you know we showing love (Stuntin')
Yeah
This shit is all about the come up
Niggas started low but then
We had to get them runs up
Had to get the ones up
Had to get them hunnids up
We dropped the album
And we tryna get our numbers up
Yeah, the whole clique get paid
Bad hoes get slayed, and my life too made
Nigga so clean
I don't even need a maid
I'm shining on these niggas
Even when they sending shade
That's me, Young Rock, too fresh
God with me, stay fly, too blessed
Work hard, all day, no rest
I ain't even been responding to the texts but
I'm all about a check, run it up fast
Nigga already know that it's straight cash
Nigga ain't ever need a G pass
But if you talking bout a stack then I need that

[Verse 3: D-SIK]
Where were you when I was tryna get it
Back before tours
When I was doing shows
With nobody to perform for
Back when I was dropping tracks
Everyone ignored or
When I was dressing wack
Because I couldn’t afford more
Now I got bands
Like the mother fucking Warped Tour
This year me and Rockie out here
Running up the scoreboard
My name ringing bells
Must be what they at my door for
But the circles small
Fit ‘em alI in the four door
Yeah, it's just me and my delegates
Running shit like I'm Edelman
Please stop standing so close to me
Bitch this lamb skin is delicate
Last year you were still sleeping
So you ain't reaping the beneftis
All my exes that left me
Tell me how much they've regretted it
They thought that I was gassing it
Trust me that was just revving it
I'm making and spending it
Yeah, I'm paid and I'm relevant
Now the ones that resented it
Try to act cool
Asking for a hand out
But I gotta ask you...

[Hook: D-SIK]
Where were you last year?
Yeah where were you last year?
Where were you last year?
Where were you last year?
Yeah where were you last year?
(Where were you, where were you)
