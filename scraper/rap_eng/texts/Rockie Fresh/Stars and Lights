[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
It's been a while since you came around
I was just chillin on your side of town
I build it up just to break it down, take it down
I hold it down
I want it now ain't no time to waste
I need it now why you tryna wait
I got your body boomin like a 808
I wish that I could stay, it's so much I could say

[Hook: Rockie Fresh & BJ The Chicago Kid]
I talk to you, I shop with you, I stunt with you (I stunt with you)
I grind with you, shine with you, spend time with you (spend time with you)
I ride with you, take flights with you, get high with you (get high with you)
I get high with you (I get high with you)

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I done got a sip of King Lou
Say you wanna blow it down
I'm tryna' take you past the moon just say you wanna blow it down
Tryna' make you see stars and lights oh yeah
Gonna make you see the stars tonight oh yeah

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
You ain't never have this feeling in your life before
I was only buying girls Mic before
I told you you can see when the lights would glow
And you ain't never had gold this bright before
You ain't never had a nigga buy you a flight before
Pay for the rent and the light before
I hope you don't get too lazy, might fuck around and have my baby
You want a real one, 365
Who will never cheat, who will never lie
Smoke, kill but his love will never die
Nigga still hit it good even when he high
Nigga I am that and I might be
You could never ever find a nigga like me
Keep it real and I stay true, stars and light whenever I come through

[Hook: Rockie Fresh & BJ The Chicago Kid]
I talk to you, I shop with you, I stunt with you ( I stunt with you)
I grind with you, I shine with you, spend time with you (spend time with you)
I ride with you, take flights with you, get high with you (get high with you)
I get high with you (I get high with you)

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I done got a sip of King Lou
Say you wanna blow it down
I'm tryna take you past the moon just say you wanna blow it down
Tryna' make you see stars and lights oh yeah
Gonna make you see the stars tonight oh yeah

[Bridge: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Fuck with me baby we gonna go
Up Up
You ain't gotta wait no more Ima tell you now
Girl come through and blow up your spot
Girl give me all that you got hey
Girl give me all that you got got...

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I done got a sip of King Lou
Say you wanna blow it down
I'm tryna take you past the moon just say you wanna blow it down
Tryna' make you see stars and lights oh yeah
Gonna make you see the stars tonight oh yeah
