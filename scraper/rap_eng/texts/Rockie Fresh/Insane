[Intro]

[Hook: Rockie Fresh]
Whip game is insane, chain game is insane
Got a new chick and she too thick and her head game is insane
Everything is insane, everything is insane
Everything is insane, this so fucking insane

[Verse 1: YP]
Black diamonds on my G-Shock, I get paid as it tic-toc
Two dice on my big jock now watch them as they lip lock
Stunting on the haters, bitch I'm getting paper
I'm hearing from the majors I'm like Tebow with the Gators
If they say I ain't doing numbers you can tell them check the data
Got a pack full of wolves but Tyler not The Creator
Just don't get me the urge to give them the work
Have your face looking like Martin fighting Hitman Hearns
Tell them that I run this shit like Usain, Addicted to them nice things
Get it I'll be rocking probably way out your price range
Rockie bet you know the name, from the home of that gang bang
My 'nects be on the same thing, fuck hoes and stain lames
Padded room I'm insane, straight jacket flow
How everything you do a movie but you can't back the show
Taking over, thought I told you and if not then I'mma show you
While sitting V.I.P. popping corks like Sammy Sosa

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
I got that gold all on my wrist watch, get paid as it tic-toc
I'm Trying to make a bitch bop before we hit the pit stop
Don't show them where I live (Why?) Cuz I don't trust these hoes
Money coming fast (But?) But I'm sipping slow
And niggas hate but they can't harm me, buy new shit I don't do laundry
This Bape shit what your Boo got me, she treat me like I got a Bugatti
Which match the price of my offers, chilling getting my balls licked
To you that might be nasty but to me that's simply just boss shit
I'm heading to the future, nigga ain't no looking back
Turn a dollar to a hundred turn a hundred to a stack
Now we going for the mills a lot of them to be exact
All started with a dream take a look at where we at
We put on for the city and the victims of the hate
All this killing make a nigga wanna move to a different state
But I'mma stay right here I'mma grind and get my cake
Hop up in that whip's and dip while I'm drivin' 88
