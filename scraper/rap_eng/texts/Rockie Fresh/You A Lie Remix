I am working on my grind
You know how I do it
Spit a dope ass line
Go home and youtube it
Watch em views rise up
Ballin hard till sun down
Sears Towers high
Till the sky fall
Shoutout to my city ho
Windy city
You already know
City of the greatest
About to be the latest
Fame is in my cup
Bet I’m gonna taste it
Success is in my cup
Drink till I get wasted
Long nights in the studio
Dark nights
With a bright flow
Sleep all day
Up all night
That be the status quo
I’m Chicago’s greatest
I ain’t talking Portillos
Shout out to the Cubs
And that young dude Castillo
