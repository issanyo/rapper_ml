[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]

I've been waiting like you've been waiting
My heart is racing
Show you one guy's timing when you try to make it
I'm reminiscing on a time when I was your favorite
I can see it in your eyes and you ain't even have to say it
I see you hopped in that driver seat of your own life
And noone can control where you're going
Plus I'm already knowing you're grown
Now you have no time for the games
I been doing some growing too and I been thinking the same
I know I fucked up a few times in the past
But if we had some good times we got better math
I remember when Drew dropped me off at your crib
And I thought I'd never see you again
Look at this

[Hook]

I can tell you can tell
Keep it real, keep it real
This is weird for both of us
How you feel? How you feel?
I can't tell if it's real
If I'm dreaming wake me up

(Oh shit, guess it's been a...)

I've been gone for too long
I've been gone for too long

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]

It's been a while since I been on tour
And where I really been you really wasn't too sure
I lost my aunt and I ain't want the fame no more
And niggas lying, talking 'bout how he ain't signed no more
But I just had to spend time with who I am working for
And rearrange who I'm working with
It was some hurtful shit
Some people said I missed my window, I said fuck it
Climbed up the stairs and hopped out the one above it
And these rappers beefing back and forth
I'm just rolling up again
'bout to kick the door down
Since they ain't want to let us in
And these girls suck too many dicks
So I don't smoke with them
I'm still high off you I mean damn who would've knew

[Hook]

I can tell you can tell
Keep it real, keep it real
This is weird for both of us
How you feel? How you feel?
I can't tell if it's real
If I'm dreaming wake me up

(Oh shit, guess it's been a...)

I've been gone for too long
I've been gone for too long

[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]

Man if I had to choose a side I would cross your line
And you crucify pride when you cross my mind
And if you give me one more time
You'll want 10 more times
Look, we ain't got to die for us to live in the sky
Cause you and I, young and fly
We can make it out this life
We used to joke like I'm your husband
And I joked like you're my wife
You the type
We don't care what anybody say
Since you're the type
To smoke a blunt with me on our wedding day
We [?] the time fades away
We just laughing, we just tripping
You love my sense of humor
Though some people never get it
Sometimes I don't respond
So sometimes I feel distant
You know I don't fear committment
It's just, it's just

[Hook]

I can tell you can tell
Keep it real, keep it real
This is weird for both of us
How you feel? How you feel?
I can't tell if it's real
If I'm dreaming wake me up

(Oh shit, guess it's been a...)

I've been gone for too long
I've been gone for too long
