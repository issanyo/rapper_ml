[Chorus:]
Couple bitches in the drop, yeah that's all a nigga want
When my niggas getting guap, yeah that's all a nigga want
Shorty say she rolling with it, so I do everything he don't
If she popping and she shopping, I get everything she want
That's all I want, that's all I want, that's all I want
That's all I want, that's all I want, that's all I want
That's all I want, that's all I want, that's all I want
That's all I want, that's all I want, that's all I want

[Verse 1:]
Now I always can do better, fall in love that's no no never
Hoes be tryna put on pressure, since I [?] the Lexus
She say diamonds last forever, shit Rockie last forever
She had one night with the flyest, now she lighter than a feather
Whipping wings in my kitchen, my palms steady itching
I always had the vision, she see the way I'm living
I'm running getting money every minute of the clock
A nigga out here winning I can't even lose a sock
She see the way I hustle like I came up off the block
I be balling like a jock, every thing her nigga not
She want them planes, I fly on that
She want them coupes, I ride in that
She know a nigga grind, don't slack
She know a nigga make that crack
Cause she addicted

[Chorus:]
Couple bitches in the drop, yeah that's all a nigga want
When my niggas getting guap, yeah that's all a nigga want
Shorty say she rolling with it, so I do everything he don't
If she popping and she shopping, I get everything she want
That's all I want, that's all I want, that's all I want
That's all I want, that's all I want, that's all I want
That's all I want, that's all I want, that's all I want
That's all I want, that's all I want, that's all I want

[Post-Chorus:]
Is that too much to ask?
Run me all my cash
I need a bag, I need a bag, I need a bag

[Verse 2:]
Niggas ask me for loans, bitches hitting my phone
I just rolled up a couple and now I'm back in my zone
I tell 'em trip if they want, they could flip if they want
I got a hand zone hustle, I get a grip when I want
I like my twenties, fifties, hundreds real straight honor that
They'll be a wrinkle in my face before a wrinkle in my stack
And even when my hands gray, I be thinking bout that pay
Feeling like that nigga Jay, I mean "What More Can I Say"?
Getting head, getting bread, I enjoy the simple things
Niggas sleeping on me, but I'm really out here living dreams
Treat these bitches like they're queens, never seen on many scenes
Chill nigga but I always keep it real nigga

[Chorus:]
Couple bitches in the drop, yeah that's all a nigga want
When my niggas getting guap, yeah that's all a nigga want
Shorty say she rolling with it, so I do everything he don't
If she popping and she shopping, I get everything she want
That's all I want, that's all I want, that's all I want
That's all I want, that's all I want, that's all I want
That's all I want, that's all I want, that's all I want
That's all I want, that's all I want, that's all I want

[Outro:]
That's all I want, that's all I want, that's all I want
That's all I want, that's all I want, that's all I want
That's all I want, that's all I want, that's all I want
That's all I want, that's all I want, that's all I want
Big house
Big whips
New bitch
Clean drawls
New tits
