I done came up on my same shit that I usually be on
Y'all stayin' here but I'm everywhere, my nigga I'm gone
I done killed shows, hit milestones, and I did it my way
I'm smokin' good, still makin' moves all up in my estate

[Verse 1: Martin $ky]
I sit high but my eyes so low
Young niggas runnin' league, yeah we all went pro
Niggas quit cause the ground too slow
Had to keep on killin' cause I'm going for the gold
She wanna fuck the realest in the city
Now she fuckin' on the realest nigga in the fuckin' city
And the tab got me faded when it hit me
So the moves to be made kinda iffy
My nigga I've been in it for a minute, they been sleepin' on the kid
Too real on my own shit, trappin' in the whip
In the city full of wolves, gotta move so slick
God Level with the beats, I'm a wizard with the shit
No camo but I'm really in the field, havin' thousand dollar dreams while I'm headed for the mils
Burn a couple O's just for the fuck of it, all while I'm pourin' up a glass for the thrills
You still ain't heard a nigga beats hit like these
Got a few joints rolled, 'bout to smoke 'bout three
Shit got real, hope the tape don't leak
I be good in a minute, in a second don't blink
Rollin' 'round the city with my niggas in the whip
And we all got moves so the night so lit
And the crowd mad full so I gotta go spit
Dreads over my eyes in an all black fit
Go figure that (Go figure that)
Always put the time and the work in, I get it back
Manifest thoughts for the whole damn squad, we livin' that
Hope for the best, I'm expectin' the worst
Moves get made everyday, no rest
Shut the fuck up talkin' if you don't cut checks

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
I'm in the drop M6
And the shit all white like a nigga move bricks
I'm by myself I ain't never need a clique
Like a young Mr. Deeds I can get you what you need
Said I'm reachin' new heights
I done fucked bad bitches, I done put 'em on flights
I kept the Rollie and the chain on
So in that case, I might as well leave on the lights
Man, this game so crazy
Workin' hard on 'em, nah, nigga ain't lazy
These fuck niggas gotta pay me
Ask 'em who the best and I bet you they gon' say me
Chi town representer, nigga get money like a mothafuckin' money printer
I'm cold nigga like this shit December, but it's the summer time, it mean this bitch finna front on mine
Got the point and the underline, yeah, I signed with Puma like I'm runnin' track
Fuck nigga talkin' 'bout me, bet he never, ever in his life seen a hundred stacks
Nigga I done spent that, and I done fucked around and made all one hundred back
Now I'm lookin' at the mils, shoutout to MMG cause I'm really fuckin' with the deal
Yeah, rollin' up when I'm smoked to kill, got you rollin' like I popped a pill
I don't ever do X, okay I fucked my old bitch, I guess I really do ex
I'm up next, stackin' big money yeah couldn't get more checks
Finna cop my mom a Lexus, I'm that nigga, fuck with me
