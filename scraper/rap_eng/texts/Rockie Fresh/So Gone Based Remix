[Intro]
Twisting up a blunt, thinking about my next dollar
Getting in the game, trying to get some money out her
Twisting up a blunt, thinking about my next dollar
Getting in the game, trying to get some money out her
Twisting up a blunt, thinking about my next dollar
Getting in the game, trying to get some money out her
Twisting up a blunt, thinking about my next dollar
Getting in the game, trying to get some money out her

[Verse One: Lil B]
Trying to get some money out her, riding up in her
Young Based God, I got cold up in the Winter
50 on my neck because I’m rich and I’m a sinner
Every bitch love me ‘cause I cum and I be in her
Paid 30 thousand for the necklace, it’s expected
Straight West Coasting, bitches osmosis
Niggas know low in the game, do fold though
Ride up, I swagged up bitch, you know though

[Hook]
‘Cause they pouring and I'm sipping, they losing while I'm still winning
And y'all wifing but I'm still pimping and they worried but I ain't tripping
‘Cause I’m so gone, I’m so gone, I’m so gone, I’m so gone
I’m so gone, I’m so gone, I’m so gone, I’m so gone
But I do know one thing though, women and men are hoes
Niggas here through Sunday, Monday but soon they'll be exposed
Maybe they'll love me one day, maybe they'll let it show
Until then, I'll just keep on rocking all these shoes and clothes

[Verse Two: Rockie Fresh]
‘Cause I be on some fly shit but please believe this nigga ain’t the one
Get a lot of head, got these hoes going dumb
Since I been on track, other rappers on the run
And I would do the same if I saw me in the game
Got a little change and I got a little fame
But all real niggas gonna feel this nigga at the end of the day
When they see that we the same and this boss shit is a habit
If I want it, I can have it, I would take your girl but she too ratchet
The kid is on point like I’m playing for the Mavericks
Fresh to death like I rap in caskets but the boy is so alive
And I don't really care about the prize ‘cause this Rosé got me nodding

[Hook]
