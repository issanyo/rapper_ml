We really just doing this shit
To piss you niggas off even more
(Hope that tells you somethin')

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Look, it’s that towel under the
Door rap
Finding notices on the floor mats
Five hundred dollar smoking fines
Can’t let’em blow my high
Cause I really can’t afford that
Versatility’s what we get for nigga
Check my Wiki nigga I’m jiggy nigga
And I’ve been eating good for a minute
They just startin to get it
I stay hungry like Twista's sister
We never knowin what tomorrow
Holds
So I’m just in Toronto
Wit Toronto hoes
Ridin' with the city’s Obama
We Maybach reclinin'
My thoughts is I need higher goals
(Money)
And really I got a new agenda
I heat it up, you niggas just
A warm December
I’m leaving dust like Olympian track runners
Put up mad numbers, you niggas
Missing like bad jumpers
I’m in America, with American bitches
On Italian leather so nigga
Watch where you sittin'
Notice shit, Reminiscin' of all the shit that you
Grew up in
Wishin you call up on me when you
Needed a hit and shit
I’m busting at bustin made, fuckin lames
Roll wit some Rio Alto niggas
Steady screamin, "fuck a flame!"
I-E to the A nigga, my team finna win nigga
Ridley wit a Benz in it
You niggas is fuckin' gay!
Pause
And there’s no offense to those, but
I got more haters
Than I got hoes...JK
I just lied on that line before
You know these ladies treat me like a bicycle, ride out

[Hook: Hit-Boy]
And I’m just smashing on the
Critics with a vengeance, fuck the feelings and opinions
Niggas talk
Before they listen
That’s the picture, that's that intentional cynical
Fuck niggas, get off my genitals
Before I come back and let it loose
I’m over the top and I’m ready to
Shoot

(Look...I gotta let that shit breath one time)
(That nigga Rockie checkin' in)
(Yeah, we gotta get to that special part of the beat
You know when that shit drop)

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
I just wish that I could’ve
Appeared on Entourage
Smoked out on Oprah couch
Chillin' wit my moms
I’m blowing out those
So everything I do is bomb
And every time I cruise I turn a fool
Into a peep in time
Jerry Sandusky wouldn't feel these boys
Probably cause his pussy weak
You see it every time you meet
Its lights, camera, action
Anytime that Rockie speak
Day I ask and them boys lost like Mr.Cheech
And me I stay a-bove par, shit
I done got so high
I hit my head on Mars
And this bitch say her man not
A fan of stars
He said my shit be weak
I got candy bars
But her fingers still stay on my
Dick
Be Twix
She started workin' and fell in love with the Kick
Its cat eyes everytime she gotta look at the shine
Pay day, when I'm finished
I get back to my grind
I got a beautiful mind
Its always racin'
And I’m about to take another lap
Stating real facts
Like a motherfucking Snapples cap
Got the juice, two pockets back
Purify, it is intact
Keep it true, may goto Fiji
Let the homies scale the map
And I’m stumbling on honeys
While I’m sipping liquor
I get paid to ride kicks
Now ain't that a kicker
I got these names writing paragraphs in the pictures
Alot of rappers sensitive, so I dont fuck wit niggas
Uh, but if you real I got a blunt on me
Uh, and I'mma pass it if you want
Uh, cause somewhere in America
Uh, Amanda Bynes is still smokin'
