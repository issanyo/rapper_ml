[Hook 1]
Ay word to Nas I want that rap shit back
Word to Jay I want that rap shit back, ay
Ay, word to Pac I want that rap shit back
Word to Big I want that rap shit back
And these people always ask me why you rap like that?
90s baby going crazy I don't lack like that
Shouts out all my real ones that want that rap shit back
Young Rockie Chi-Town we brought that rap shit back, amen

[Verse 1]
Remember working on my first tape
Rockie's Modern Life, a young nigga I'm just tryna get it right
Future bright I'm in junior college by my family house
I'm bumping College Dropout or that Reasonable Doubt
I'm on the couch high school was Dedication 1, Dedication 2
I wore that bape before you niggas ever knew, this is true
It's so Common I be chilling with my crew
They say the sky is like the limit so I'm praying through it too
Like

[Hook 2]
3K I want that rap shit back
Mos Def I want that rap shit back
Big L I want that rap shit back
Big Pun I want that rap shit back
And these people always ask me why you rap like that?
90s baby going crazy I don't lack like that
Shouts out all my real ones that want that rap shit back
Young Rockie Chi-Town we brought that rap shit back, amen

[Verse 2]
I played the Chronic way before I hit the weed
Learn them trailer park struggles, Marshall Mathers LP
And it's back to 2Pac it's all eyes on me
A Black album 03 we was burning CDs but
I can say no album made me feel like the Miseducation of the Queen Lauryn Hill
Or that Lupe Food and Liquor made me think a little quicker
I was just a lil nigga tryna see the big picture, yeah
Play Snoop Dogg, Doggystyle, knock 'em down
Still playing LL when them girls come around
Feeling like an Outkast so I took it out of town
Playing UGK cause I'm still underground
And I'm on my Jada shit to the top we gon' make it
I still wish they had Rap City in the basement
As a youngin' they would always tell me that the game is always changin'
Well back to the future I'ma take it, take it

[Hook 3]
That nigga Cole brought the rap shit back, nigga Kendrick brought that rap shit back, yeah
My nigga Vic brought that rap shit back, my nigga Chance brought that rap shit back
And these people always ask me why you rap like that?
90s baby going crazy I don't lack like that
Shouts out all my real ones that want that rap shit back
Young Rockie Chi-Town I brought that rap shit back
Amen
