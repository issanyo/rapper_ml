[Hook 1]
From the top of the first page
To the end of the last day
From the start in your own way
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are

[Verse 1]
From the bottom to the top floor, and I'm trying to make it further
See I just met with money and I'm happy with that merger
Doing shit you never heard of, taking my city to a different place
Few niggas did this shit before but it's about that time change of face
I'm going up with my eyes low wack cuz I've been smoking
Told them I would do it, but they thought that I was joking
Now I'm on

[Bridge]
And I ain't listening to what you say
Nigga, you a hater, don't even talk to me

[Verse 2]
This road that I have chosen, I'm happy so I'm speeding down it
I know how to handle that money simply cause I be around it
And a nigga is so fucking fly, but somehow I'm still grounded
Bitches coming to my crib, and a young nigga pound it
Yea I do that, flow so motherfucking stupid
Put an arrow in your heart like cupid
Off of this young fly here music, and I'm moving up

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Ain't even got a motherfucking tracklist
But you're saying I'm the best at this rap shit
Take the beat of the motherfucking captive
Then I take the money and make the shit back-flip
Yeah, I lost my mind but found some hoes
Was it the game or designer clothes?
You ain't worth a nickel, son, don't jack my flows
Don't be mad at me cause I got chose
Took my situation, made it the best
All of that whack shit, I laid it to rest
New 3's, Bape tees, God damn a nigga fresh
And my money coming up but the tops are depressed
It's down

[Bridge]

[Hook 2]
Is there anybody out there who
Is lost and hurt and lonely too
Are they bleeding all your colours into one?
And if you come undone
As if you've been run through
Some catapult it fired you
You wonder if your chance will ever come
Or if you're stuck in square one
