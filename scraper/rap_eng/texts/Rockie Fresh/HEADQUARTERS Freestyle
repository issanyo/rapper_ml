[Intro]
Your nigga Rockie checkin’ in
My nigga Lunice on the beat

[Verse 1]
Alright I’m making new arrangements, they stuck on this same shit
At this point in life I’m feelin’ there’s nothing I can’t get
Expect the unexpected from the one you neglected
Nice crib, nice credit, plus I’m highly protected
I got some cool white boys, that’s some well-trained snipers
Adventurous motherfuckers, pull up in Dodge Vipers
You think you got the drop on us? They gon’ windshield wipe you
They ain’t with the Twitter shit, they are not gon’ type you
Yo me I’m on some Comms shit, smoking some bomb shit
Try not to spend my money on frivolous nonsense
Dreams of getting rich, ain’t got a bitch on my conscience
But if she with me, she got potential and promise
I break nine, I’m working all day, I’m in a great spot
Burnin’ all these motherfuckin’ trees, I got the place hot
Me and the team could pull out all the cars and fill up eight lots
Ride with us, or just wish you signed with us, nigga

[Verse 2]
We killin’ shit worldwide, these fuckboys gotta witness
Watch these lame niggas try and ask for forgiveness
I gotta shout out to my women, ’cause they know we be livin’
My bitch Mary, head good, I might wife her by Christmas
And she ain’t got a man, she ain’t got a son
She got a job, she off tonight, she say she havin’ fun
And she don’t fuck with many niggas, but she know that I’m the one
I’m makin’ money and I heard that money make her come
And she love how I’m forthright, four days, four flights
I always had the foresight to see through these niggas
That’s probably why I’m rollin’ all in your bitch, nigga
Now you ball less, old chicken strip nigga
Bloodclot, they don’t wanna see me get bigger
All gold, boy I gotta shine in every picture
Middle finger up, I give a fuck what niggas think
I’m ’bout to roll another blunt, I’m ’bout to pour another drink
Faded

[Outro]
Stop the bitchin’
Stop the bitchin’
Stop the bitchin’
Nigga stop the bitchin’
Stop the bitchin’
Stop the bitchin’
With your barkin’ ass
(Hold on)
Stop the bitchin’
Stop the bitchin’
Stop the bitchin’
Nigga stop the bitchin’
Stop the snitchin’
And stop the bitchin’
With your barkin’ ass
