[Verse 1: Minty Burns]
Battle rapper life, Kawasaki bikes
Kappa Maki rolls, Akasaka nights
Only get in what you put in that's a fact of life
To be the greatest there ain't nothin' I won't sacrifice
Haters see me cashing checks
Like what you mad at cousin?
Junction Road didn't hold me back
Had to adapt and function
When you a rapper most these people making bad assumptions
(Why's that?)
Shoulda said I was the singer from the Smashing Pumpkins
For my grandkids, ain't just how I planned this
Yellow brick road like the fuckin' middle Kansas
Tryna turn a penny to a dream, man what's the chances
We ain't growin' up to be some city slickin' bandits
Underwater with the sharks I'm in Aruba bitches, (I'm In Aruba!)
Takin' shots at your boy I'm sending Cuban missiles
Seems they forgot about you, probably never miss you
'Til they see you in that GQ newest issue

[Chorus]
Live my life just how I feel
Smokin' on the finest haze
And I be on my grind for real
I do this shit like everyday
The studio ain't far from here
And we can make a movie there
So if you come around the way (yeah)
I'll show you that this shit for real

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Problem with these pussy niggas they don't know me well
They can't recognize real, but they ho can tell
Mac shit got her singing like she was Adele
Since you rollin L's, Now you takin' L's
Geez, I'm prolly somewhere overseas
Why you hangin' with has beens and wannabes?
Niggas that talk about it and always wanted G's
And when they think of money, they always think of me
Shit I got more comin' to me
Success runnin' all through me in my veins feel the pain
As a youngin run the game
Who the mother fucker how they say my name,  Rockie nigga
Ain't no way they can stop me nigga
Life is like a movie you should watch me nigga
Rollin' clean when I hit the scene
Pop a bean get high to me, yeah

[Chorus]
