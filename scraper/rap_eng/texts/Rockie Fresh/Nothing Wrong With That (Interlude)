Coolest bitch I ever met

Girl ain't nothing wrong with that, fuck with me
Girl ain't nothing wrong with that, fuck with me
Girl ain't nothing wrong with that, fuck with me
Girl ain't nothing wrong with that
And Ima take my time, Ima take my time
Ima make you mine, Ima make you mine
Ima take my time, Ima take my time
Ima take my time, Ima take my time
Ima make you mine, Ima make you mine

Pour a glass of wine let me watch you shine
And Ima take my time, Ima take my time

You ain't gotta be alone baby just pick up your phone and fuck with me
Girl ain't nothing wrong with that
