[Verse 1]
Got this money on my mind but
Lately I’ve been giving all my time up
Trying to figure out what’s going on
Seems like everything is going wrong
I wonder if I’ll make it home

[Verse 2]
Started to notice the difference
Saw it in her when she moved
Said I started to see all the changes
She thought she could hide it too
Started to think we could make it
Mistaken to think that we could have worked it out
Said I started to believe that, maybe we can be that
Think that we’ll last forever

[Chorus]
Ohhhh, ahhhh
Said my mind's made up
Said my mind's made up

[Verse 2]
And lately I’ve been smoking more than regular
Been going out of zone like I can’t get enough
Another girl call when you hanging up
I’m just too young to handle love
But I tried so, it was taking all my time though
Disrespecting on my grind though
This drama in my mind though
Should know that you was fine though
Trying not to get behind
That ass so fat when I get behind
Wishing I could take my time
Said I'm wishing I could take my time

[Chorus 2: Rockie Fresh]
Nahh I got my mind made up
My mind made up
Nahh I got my mind made up
I got my mind made up
