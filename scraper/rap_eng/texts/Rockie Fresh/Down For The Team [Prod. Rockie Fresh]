While you’re place running like base god
But all my rhymes good homie, all my rhymes good
Digits never lying, but you know a Tiger Would
I’m, hitting birdies, scope them out, so many fans can’t keep a count i
Lock the key, to my safe, cause all them girls want a peace of me
Peace & Great thats how i live, them other rappers can’t amount to shit
Shh, keep it down, lot of fake friends i don’t keep around
Like my women square, never get around
