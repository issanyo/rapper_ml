[Hook]
Been one of those days
Safety first don't push
What's the hurry?
One nerve remaining
Waiting on one look
Have you got it?
Have you got it in you?
Have you got it in you?

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
Its so obvious I got it, man I gotta be the one
I'm making it my business but it used to be for fun
And no I'm not a catholic but I'm doing it like nun
It all started with a dream and now look what I've become
So the real question is: how can ya'll question me?
What can I do for ya'll and what do ya'll expect from me?
I wanna learn but I can't let you niggas lesson me
And if you got a problem, come at me respectfully
Cause I ain't the type to trip on how far you wanna take it
I've been fucked up, let down, but through that imma make it
My face is to the future, my back is to the basics
And my niggas still waiting on they payment
And I told 'em that I got it
But to get it how far have I gone?
I look at all I drink
All the weed I've blown
I used to smell like Polo, but now kush is my cologne
In the same house I grew up in
But the fathers late from home, in my mind
Since I've been out here on my grind
Ive been trying to find
The time to rewind and go back
To the place that I was at
Before I found you and before I found rap
But since I got it, I'm feeling something different in me
Women wanna fuck me
All the niggas envy getting paper by the plenty
I'm finding my wealth
I'm trying to find my niche without losing myself

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
You know I got it, you shouldn't have to ask me twice
Not having and I'm dancing and I'm rapping for my afterlife
These niggas ain't half as nice
They ain't even payed the price
Now I'm getting ghost on them, feeling kind of Capser-like
Uhh, and I be on to my next chick
Tryna make my next girl better than my ex chick
Leave the game breathless, take the life out
Niggas stab me in the back and still ain't take the knife out
So I still feel pain, it's going through my mental
While exceeding expectations with exceptional credentials
In this race I've lived, I feel like I'm a pencil
Its hard not to be hot with all the hell I've been through
But I'm still here standing
Paper I'm demanding
I take nothing for granted
And nothings ever handed cause I'm young
And tell 'em this is my year
And niggas better stop because it's obvious I got it

[Hook]
