[Hook]
A young nigga getting paper
Tell me do it now, but I swear I'll do it later
Ducking and dodging, tryna stay away from fake shit
Niggas wanna hate us, but the bitches wanna date us

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I live my life like bungee ropes and backflips
And I want it all like 20 hoes at Saks fifth
Yeah, Uncle Dave made the track hit
So I beat the beat up just like I did my last chick
Rock the same sneakers, I don't remember my last switch
Still on that same shit which means I'm never past tense
Yeah, yeah, shout-out to the Chi-Town
All I ever know is keep going and never drop out
The promoters be bogus homie I need my cash now
Young Veggies and the green stand for cash cow
And watch me milk it all out
Told myself, if I get a chance, I'm going all out
The fourth quarter is open, I'm tryna ball now
I got goals, she knows, she tryna call now
She's throwing, she knows I ain't gonna stall out
We give a damn what these rap niggas talk about
I'm way younger and my style well thought out
Iâ€™m independent, you niggas think I bought out
Young nigga wylin', 30 thousand
On tour 40 miles and (?)

[Bridge]
She know I got dollars and I'm always on mine
I don't come 'round when she want me but I'm always on time (Whenever I come!)
Grinding and I'm knowing I'm gon' get my shine
We endin' in the front so ya'll should get in line

[Verse 2: Rocky Fresh]
It's Mr Fresh up in this bitch, now tell me can you handle it?
Put the heat on wax like a muthafuckin candlestick
Nigga lighting cannabis (hydro catch a tan of this?)
Care less about a hater, give a fuck if you a fan of it
Tell me I'm the man and shit, the truth I do without lying
A hard worker and I spit until my mouth tired
You heard I'm hostile, support to get my account higher
Or you gonna act like Robin Williams and doubt fire
I'm never tired cause I'm always on the rise
Models chick between the thighs, could you even be surprised
I'm just chilling with my guys on some high class shit
Y'all graduate from lame and get a master in disguise
That's why me and Casey winning cause we staying true to us
And these hoes be busting down every time we hit em up
Just a year ago, I swear ain't nobody give a fuck
Now I walked up in the game, niggas running out of luck damn

[Hook]

[Bridge]

Going hard, getting paper for a month or two
Dude be on that old shit, she said she wanted something new
I grind it out and get it in like my mother do
Got up in the game and a nigga getting W's...

Rockie Fresh and Casey Veggies in this bitch
Young niggas gettin' money
No matter what you do, you'll never take it from me
