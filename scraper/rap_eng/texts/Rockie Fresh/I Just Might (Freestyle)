[Intro: Rockie Fresh]
And Rockie checking in
Just might be one of the realest niggas to do this shit
Fuck with me, yeah

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
See I just might be a sleeper, I just might be a dream
I just might be a worker, I just might be the king
I just might pull up and smoke wit ya and show you shit you ain't seen
I just might
Motherfuckers better get it right, show you what we livin' like
Look, it's crazy when you think about what could happen
So many ways we could look at it
Really ain't trying to be taken backwards and I got no time for these new actors
Tryna get a role in this movie shit in which I like to call: My Life
Boy I just might be the next number one nigga now every move I make I think twice
And not only that but I got to think about Price, not as far as money but the cost of my life
Cause right now I mean something, this a 4 on 1 and my team comin'
Long as Kels got me, Jigga got me, Daley got me, I'm straight
Gurley gave me a couple thousand like young homie just wait
And I did that
I told momma that her kid back and I'm going for everything
I be fucking bitches til the wedding ring, I swear my wife gon' be a Queen
I just might take her to Rome
Just might count a cool hundred thousand right when I'm getting some dome
Like what the fuck am I on?
Man it's been a long time comin', but I'm still runnin' tryna get straight to the top of this shit
Why you think I be dropping this shit?
I promise I really got love for this shit
I got love for the fans, and I love taking pics
I got love for the bitches that love doing dick
I got love for the money that never will switch
I got love for the keys and that's shout-out to Mitch

[Outro: Rockie Fresh]
Yeah... Yeah
We just might the leaders of the whole free world...
