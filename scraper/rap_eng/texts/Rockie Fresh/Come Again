[Hook: Rockie Fresh]
Come again
Niggas don't know who they talking to
Somebody tell'em to come again
He is a boss y'all cannot front on him
Yea, they got to come again
Yea, he a mess but you know we too blessed
Ain't no way I can fuck with him
No way no how y'all got to come again

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
Yea, Rockie just wanna win
He don't save, he spend
He don't need a friend
He pull up solo quick
With some dough to split
You tried to play him so now you're not getting shit
I planted it was a coincidence
I moved so perfectly through all my incidents
I killed it, I'm showing no innocence
I really love it, I promise it's intimate
I just want to speak for my soul
Need to talk with god I need a beat from Cole
I need a verse from Jay, I'm talking classic Hov
Almost broke my fucking wrist when I stood at the stove
And I almost got sick when I looked at my clothes
Looked at my edge, now I am stuck at the stage
See I was taring out paper, just perfecting this page
And now the class is back in session cause I upped it a grade
And nowadays they got to

[Hook: Rockie Fresh]
Come again
Niggas don't know who they talking to
Somebody tell'em to come again
He is a boss y'all cannot front on him
Yea, they got to come again
Yea, he a mess but you know we too blessed
Ain't no way I can fuck with him
No way no how y'all got to come again

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
I bounced back from all of my losses
I won't say I'm perfect, I won't say I'm flawless
I just can't let fuckups happen to often
We fucking up if we let Trump in the office
Niggas get lockep up on fraudulent charges
It's almost like cases just fade in the darkness
Okay, the homie so weak he can't see the light of day
But cops killing kids and they let them out right away
Ain't it so crazy how the system play
I heard so many reporters say
Niggas kill niggas, hustlers kill hustlers
We clearly need help, bitches still saying fuck us
They cleary don't love you
We came from the dirt but perfected the hustle
Now we out here getting work go and tell a friend
If you ain't talking 'bout them M's
Nigga, you should
