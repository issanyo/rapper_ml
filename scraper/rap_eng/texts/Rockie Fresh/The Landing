[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
So many places that I want to see
So many countries where I want to go
Will I make it? I don't really know
But Lord knows that I'm working for it
Shit I can't be like these other guys
They bullshitting and they telling lies
Reality done went and caught them by surprise
Yeah see I done  seen niggas go broke
Trying hard to be cool, chasing the thrills
Then they get behind on they bills
This a message to the kids
Growing up, it's real
I ain't never seen woman make a man of steel
People swear they got bullet proof
Flesh and blood
The game so dirty
But I'm fresh in mud
Tired of how I'm living
So I packed shit up
Put years of my memory
In the back of a truck
They say there ain't nothing wrong
With a change of scene
A playa act up
Then he changed his team
I think you got a problem [?]
Can't pick a side can you be too neutral?
I wish I had another whole 'nother planet to move to
Like the Jetson's, will you miss me?
That's the question
No more stressing
Maybe it's respect then
Maybe it's a blessing

[Hook: Rockie Fresh]
Shout out everyone i'm cool with
Everybody I went to school with
Every person I ever worked with
Even people I went to church with
Got high, blew the loud, rolled the purp with
Every bitch I chilled on the surf with
Since you make my life better
Now a young nigga ready for whatever
