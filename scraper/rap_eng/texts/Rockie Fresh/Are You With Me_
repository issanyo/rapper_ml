[Intro: Rockie Fresh (Ed Sheeran)]
What's her name (Jasmine)
I met a couple like you before
You original though, yeah
Nigga, Rockie checkin' in (Jasmine)
Shit kinda got a ring to it
Fuck with the swag, ride with me

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Are you with me Jasmine?
Won't you let me in?
Won't you let me over?
I could pour a love Gin
Are you with me Jasmine?
Won't you let me in?
Won't you let me over?
I could pour a love Gin

[Post-Chorus: Rockie Fresh (Ed Sheeran)
You know I love it when you dance for me (Jasmine)
But I hate when you make plans for me
Cause a youngin' wanna do what he wanna do

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
Yeah, now you one of the baddest alive (Jasmine)
You made me take a shot, and straight swallow my pride
I wanna push all these other hoes to the side
It's two seats in the whip if you ready to ride, yeah
So fly that your lows are my ceilings
I just wanna buy you heels and give you sexual healing
[?] understand I'm too willing
And I don't like to argue when I'm smoking and chillin'
Cause nowadays anger's crazy as well
But I been raised well, I'm the son of Michelle
Eyes bout to be ahead, and taught never to tell
I'm slept on, so right now my name might not ring a bell
But pretty soon, by next June, they all gon' be on me (Jasmine)
So if you don't get it, still act like you know me
I'm only twenty-three with the whole world in front of me
And right here is where you wanna be

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Are you with me Jasmine?
Won't you let me in?
Won't you let me over?
I could pour a love Gin
Are you with me Jasmine?
Won't you let me in?
Won't you let me over?
I could pour a love Gin

[Post-Chorus: Rockie Fresh (Ed Sheeran)
You know I love it when you dance for me (Jasmine)
But I hate when you make plans for me
Cause a youngin' wanna do what he wanna do

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh (Ed Sheeran)]
Now you say I know you better than you know yourself (Jasmine)
You say I give you feelings that you never felt
A cool nigga but in seconds I could make you melt (Jasmine)
So you buy me Gucci belts, Louis belts, Fendi belts
And we were slow dancing in the burner room (Jasmine)
While I was trying discrete to pass you was tryna jump the broom
A dirty game, the moment that we found the fame (Jasmine)
Instantly you just knew that that shit was gonna bring you pain
Let's just say that they game is [?] color (Jasmine)
Good to know that you wasn't with me just for the money
Did we make this shit official? Was I really cheating?
Did I not let you kick it with your girlfriends every weekend?
I know we used to smoke together now, right now you tweaking
And yeah, I have my talents shawty, and you know she decent
Okay you know she bad, and yeah, I know you mad
But when we cross paths, I be missing every time he had

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
When I see you Jasmine, what's a boy to do?
Please come back to me, make my dreams come true
When it comes to heartbreak, what's a little girl like you?
When I'm close to her, make my dreams come true

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
Are you with me Jasmine?
Won't you let me in?
Won't you let me over?
I could pour a love Gin
Are you with me Jasmine?
Won't you let me in?
Won't you let me over?
I could pour a love Gin

[Post-Chorus: Rockie Fresh (Ed Sheeran)
You know I love it when you dance for me (Jasmine)
But I hate when you make plans for me
Cause a youngin' wanna do what he wanna do
You know I love it when you dance for me (Jasmine)
But I hate when you make plans for me
Cause a youngin' wanna do what he wanna do
