[Intro]
I hear em talk about me, I used to let it go
Now if you got a problem, then
You should let me know

[Verse 1- Rockie Fresh]

Look -- Okay I’m Rocky right? Some people say I’m cold
Some people think I made it, I got so far to go
Some people say I’m fly, they only see my clothes
Some niggas say I’m winnin’, they judge me by my hoes
I get alotta love, of course I see the hate
I always did my thing, I never imitate
I want the finer things, but everybody does
I’m gettin’ close as hell but this ain’t always how it was
Cause I remember when, these people didn’t get me
When girls would turn me down and go the extra mile to diss me
I never came around and I swear nobody miss me
And I used to be alone, now everybody fuckin’ wit me
And them same ole niggas wanna kick it now
They used to call me lame now they appreciate my style
My name is in they mouth, and I ain’t gotta be around
From outcast to the leader of the crowd -- Wow

[Hook]
I get caught up in material things
But I won't get caught up in the drama it brings
Cause I’m in the spotlight
I hear ‘em talk about me, I used to let it go
Now if you got a problem, then you should let me know
I got alotta pain, I never let it show, guess that’s just how it goes

[Verse 2- Rockie Fresh]

Some girls will say I’m hot, some girls will say I’m cool
Some hoes will talk about me, when I used to sit in school
I see them bitches now and they must think that I’m a fool;
Sayin’ hi and I reply “who the fuck are you?”
Oh yeah, I’m cocky right? Atleast that’s what they say
Them hoes be lyin’ cause they don’t know me anyway
And shout out to the new one’s, yall woulda did the same
But through it all I can still say I haven’t changed
And I remember when, I wasn’t on your mind
Now anybody watchin’, could see that it’s my time
You look up in the sky and you gone see the boy shine
And I used to get it in, now I’m out here on my grind
And them same ole bitches, wanna kick it now
They used to call me lame, now they appreciate my style
My name is in they mouth and I ain’t gotta be around
From outcast to the leader of the crowd -- Wow

[Hook]
I get caught up in material things
But I won't get caught up in the drama it brings
Cause I’m in the spotlight
I hear ‘em talk about me, I used to let it go
Now if you got a problem, then you should let me know
I got alotta pain, I never let it show, guess that’s just how it goes

[Outro- Rockie Fresh]

Im sittin' here, just tryin' to get my mind right
Chillin' in the spotlight, Uh
Tryin' get my mind right
Catch a nigga straight chillin' in the spotlight
