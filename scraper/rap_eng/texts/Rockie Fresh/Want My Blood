[Hook: DZ Deathrays]
Yeah, you want it, you want my blood
Yeah, you want it, you want my blood

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
I'm the fliest in my city, when you see me, say what's up
I'll be riding with my den, yeah, I'm all about a buck
I got hundreds on my table, bumping twenties on your truck
Little homies think they fly, they can get them feathers plucked
My first mixtape was a smash, they called it beginner's luck
But Rockie still moving up and a lot of my haters stuck
So I put they ass on ice, without no skates, without no puck
Call me Gordon Bombay when I say they better duck
And I learned this game, go insane, being dope is my approach
Getting bills like Russell so I'm the player and the coach
Over here on a different note, I feel sorry for the opponents
And I got what you need, you just holler if you want it, scream...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Yeah, staying patient, destination still the other side
Driving 88 with some chicks to help enjoy the ride
Lot of fans, lot of bands plus we got a lot of pride
Got a lot of watches too but we ain't got a lot of time
Cause we always on our grind, you hating this promo
Milo on my logo, I'll be in the club dolo
But your ho know my dough high, know everybody but I'm so shy
And if you looking for them hits, then I am probably your guy
Yeah, see, I don't know about you all but I'm getting mine
And if Rockie hitting that, then that bitch is fine
I see the signs, we about to make a million man
Never been a murderer but we making a killing, scream...

[Hook 2: DZ Deathrays]
Yeah, you want it, you want my blood
Yeah, you want it, you want my blood
Want, want, you want my blood
Want, want, you want my blood
