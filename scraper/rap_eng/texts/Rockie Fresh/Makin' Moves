[Intro: RZA]
Hip hoppers
Get your microphones ready
Coming all the way from the Windy City of Chicago
Bringing you a cold flow, like tons of snow
Introducing Rockie Fresh

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
OK I wanna be the greatest of all time
Looking at the stars and I feel we can all shine
Looking at my dreams and I feel like they all mine
Seen a little pain but I'ma be just fine
I came from the dark I saw the light created a spark
It's a movie I'm just playing my part
And it's all in my heart and everyday it beats I be making moves
Even when I'm on feet I'ma make it through

[Scratch Hook](x4)
Beats I be making moves
Beats I be making moves

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Riding through my city and it's priceless
Top peeled back and the weather is the nicest
Working too hard is probably one of my vices
But it's gotta be done, games gotta get won
And right now I'm not too concerned 'bout where you from
But where you tryna go? Let a brother know
See you could plant a seed, water it and watch it grow
I'm just tryna go places I ain't never been before
He's so calm, he's so chill
The flow so mean but he nice for real
I'm just running to my momma just to pay those bills
And the team gotta eat so we all need meals
My cup runneth over and they want that spill
I always saw the plan before I saw that deal
Stay focused and soon they'll notice
The case still closed but this letter was open, we rolling

[Hook]
No matter how the wind blows
We gotta keep a cold flow
Double O's to the [?]
Cause we be making that big dough
You gotta keep a cold flow
Any way the wind blows
We be dropping that info
And we be making that big dough
We be making that big dough oh, oh, oh, oh
You gotta keep a cold flow
Any way the wind blows
We be dropping that info
And we be making that big dough
We be making that big dough oh, oh, oh, oh
