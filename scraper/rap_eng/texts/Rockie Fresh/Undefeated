[Verse One: C-San]

Yeah, I see these niggas think it’s play time, I’m like Griffin from the baseline
All in the air, now she gripping on my waistline, trying to get a glimpse
Just hoping she can taste my…enemy, say your prayer for my enemies
Stacking young bucks from N.Y to Tennessee, behind me
See, hard work is a recipe, killing tracks, every bar is like a felony yeah
But I’ve never been to prison, I’m from the city where your girl might start missing
You start to come up, you see them niggas start dissing
They try to reel you in, it’s like bait if you listen, staying in my lane
See, I’m never going fishing and staying with this mic like Pippen
Carry on tradition, time to make moves, playing Jigga man rules
I would never lose, I would never lose, I said I would never lose
I said I would never lose, I said I would never lose

[Verse Two: Rockie Fresh]

Yeah, life is getting amazing, I’m traveling across the nation
Winning, it’s apparent like it’s a child that I’m raising
Standing behind my bars like it was time that I’m facing
They standing behind a mask like Jim Carrey and Jason
Fuck is these niggas saying? They see me, the streets is watching
Wanna know what we driving, wanna know where we shopping
And wanna know where them hoes at, the real bitches disc bopping
Funny how they adore every single thing we be knocking
Well we ain’t ever stopping so every day we go in
Every time we put out, we gonna bring some dough in
Driving 88 until them motherfuckers roll in
Holler when you see me, catch a young nigga rolling
I used to want that BBC, now I’m copping a moment
Fuck all my old hoes, out here getting new fans
Lot of these rappers trying to mimic what we doing
We go by one rule: we ain’t ever losing yeah
Said we ain’t ever losing, said we ain’t ever losing
Yeah, we ain’t ever losing, tell them niggas we ain’t ever losing, I’m gone

[Verse Three: C-San]

Yeah, till I’m known as the top one, I’m in the zone like box one
Beating up the game till the cops come, yeah box ‘em out, no Pacquiao
Like Bynum, I back ‘em down, your girl, she wrap around me when you not around
All in your crib, see, the neighbors won’t hear a sound
She like how it’s going down and know how I roll around
Making all these moves, see, I’m known on my side of town
