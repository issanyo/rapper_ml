Still pimpin in this bitch x2

Verse 1
Its hard knowing my intelligence
Even though im becoming stupid rich
Always getting brain im never fucking with a stupid bitch
Im always the roll just like a drummer doing rudiments
Its clear she took advantage of the time and money you have spent
Obvious you losing it you had your spot
Now she saying im her man and she mad your not
Heard you going for my ex I understand your plot
You’ll find shes hard to hit like a half court shot
Nigga your future couldn’t even conquer my past
And my worstest over your best is treasured within my trash
Me and success gotta chemistry they ain't teach us in class
Got the formula without using a beaker or flask
Its all part of the math
A nigga living dodges the quantity of the quality bitches im starting to have
I never give em titles just like lebron or mcnabb
No matter how much they worth
Or the talents that show they have

[Hook](Everything x2)
Why
Still pimping in this bitch
Still rolling in this bitch

Verse 2
Ok im coming for it all
So your prolly get left for nothing
Im out here making hits
And these niggas ain't even bunting
Tell em that rockie stuntin
Thousand boxes of them sneakers
And he cope em by the dozen they ain't getting any cheaper
Niggas is getting booked and im challenging all my readers
And you can't get on my page with out man Dallas or my beeper
Knew shawty was a keeper believe but understand I got what it takes to make her leave
She hit me with a text that read
“One more time one more time”
That’s the only thing she be saying when she hit my line
I'm on my grind so easily she is out my mind
Her father buss and laugh and somethings to fall in line
Now she saying “One more time”
But that can never happen
Focused on forward motion I ain't with that back tracking
When I was reenacting I see I like my self better now
I gotta live it up even if it lets you down

[Hook]
