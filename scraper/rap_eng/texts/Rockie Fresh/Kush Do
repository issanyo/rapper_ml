[Verse 1]
She say she like the sight of a nigga with vision
She say them corporate niggas boring, she want a musician
She know them hoes gon' hear my phone, she don't even be trippin'
She know she good just as long as she play her position
She so wet, tried to step and was sliding and slipping
She used to be a cheerleader, was splitting and flipping
She know a lot of niggas ballin' be hittin' and dippin'
But could Rockie be different?
Some hoes they say I be playin'
Don't hear shit that they're saying
I'm just history-making, you know the time that be taking?
Got no time to be faking, speak on what is true
And every time I'm gettin' high, then all I think about is you, yeah...

[Hook]
I don't know what this kush do, but I think of you when I get high
I don't know what this kush do, but I think of you when I get high
I don't know what this kush do, but I think of you when I get high
Think of you when I get high, think of you when I get high
These other hoes they hate on you, but you find a way to get by
That attitude
And that way you move, and your clothes and shoes just too fly
I don't know what this kush do, but I think of you when I get high
Think of you when I get high, think of you when I get high

[Verse 2]
You told me that your nigga trippin', y'all don't even speak
You ain't had sex in seven days, this ain't your fuckin' week
You want someone that you can keep and not someone that creep
A lot of niggas say they 'bout it, you think talk is cheap
It's big money shit over here, I make mistakes
But know I get more dough every year, you gotta love it
And face it, a lot of niggas, they've got to bend over backwards
But Rockie got different factors, I'll take you above the rafters
Get high, get fly, take a trip to the Chi
I mean, I've had my share of bitches, I can't even deny
But for some reason, I see different when I look in your eyes
Might disappear when you blink, but when I'm smokin' I think, yeah...

[Hook x2]
