[Verse 1: Skizzy Mars]
You can call me young Olajuwan, finesse moves
Bless you if you sneeze
But if you step on my dress shoes, that's not cool
Ferragamo loafers, I don't wear em much
I heard there was a debate, so let me clear it up
Of all these niggas I'm the dopest, steady focused
The hardest nigga you soft like Brook Lopez
Vince Carter, I'm James Harden at the line, too easy
It's your choice how I'ma score, nigga choose freely
Courtside at the garden, word to Fascitelli
Couple G's on the vest, word to Cucinelli
Might catch me on the block in that Pelle Pelle
Or that Avirex, nigga I'm fresh, nothing they can tell me
Smokin' blunts watchin Keenan and Kel
Your girl says I'm dirty but I clean up well
She got a thing for black guys and black cards
Young Mars, I'm that guy with mad bars

[Bridge]
And all the pretty girls dancing off beat
I got this pretty girl dancing on me
I told her have a drink, girl I'm feelin' lonely
Said she got a friend, well I got a homie

[Hook]
I just want some quality time with you
Girl I need some quality time with you
Girl I seen the stars, they ain't as bright as you
I just want some quality time with you
(Can I get that?) x3

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
These niggas chasing more dick than the females but I just need some pussy I'ma be well
Girl I love your body and every single detail, and looking at your ass I can tell that you eat well
Yeah, we should go and get some dinner or somethin'
You know I'm fly but I never be buggin', I'm just a nigga that's buzzin'
We could talk about whatever it's nothin', but money talks and that's my favorite discussion in case you wonderin'
As far as girls you know I done had a bunch of them, but I was really fucking them, I ain't really fuck with them
As far as you, you been running through my mind making me want to spend some quality time, come and holla at me
