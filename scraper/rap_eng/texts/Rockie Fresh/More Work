[Hook: 96ix]
I got my job done and I ain't done yet
Got the whole town standin' on back
I'm like LBJ and they know that
I'm still working while they asking where them hoes at
I need
More work, more work
And all my brollies know I gotta do that dirt
More work, more work
Rolling through the city they believe me every word

[Verse 1: 96ix]
Cause I got just some time that I pay for
High level dreams that I pray for
I'm like, what if I'll never be the same and I change
From range, you can see that I go like I came
With my attitude like, leave me working cause I gotta do it
Like my mama wants it and I really wanna proof it
And I can not leave the studio yeah I wanna do it
I got something coming out and you fuckers knew it
More work, more work
And I never stop the flow til it hurts
I'm too focused didn't see your girl flirt
I want everyone to know that I heard
That they talking down on my name but I'm all good
Tryna get my way out of the backwoods
And did I real hear that they need me
How can you miss me when you never see me

[Hook: 96ix]
Job done and I ain't done yet
Got the whole town standin' on back
I'm like LBJ and they know that
I'm still working while they asking where them hoes at
I need
More work, more work
And all my brollies know I gotta do that dirt
More work, more work
Rolling through the city they believe me every word

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Yo Rockie, checkin' in, yeah
More work, lets play
A young nigga got it right like a essay
I made a promise everyday, gon' be a
And my worst day is lookin' like you niggas' best day
No stunt, yeah
We turn beef into
Cold wrist when you hold the Rollies up, yeah
Your bitch wanna role high in a whip, yeah
I put the Benz on a plane for a trip, yeah
Man these niggas ain't fly like this
They ain't rolling no weed and get high like this
Neighbors lookin' at me like a nigga move bricks
Anytime I take shots just know I won't miss
Shorty say Benz make it dance like Chris
Only sip Brown
Reminiscing all the days we out here hitting' licks
Mama hope you're out here listening to 96ix

[Hook: 96ix]
Job done and I ain't done yet

More work, more work
And all my brollies know I gotta do that dirt
More work, more work
Rolling through the city they believe me every word
