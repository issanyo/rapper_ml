[Verse 1]
Why you acting brand new babe
I’ll let you decide
Swear to God
Swear to God
Don’t let me lose my mind
But i’ve got nothing to lose babe
Not even this time
So if you gotta to judge me girl it’s all you then
I set the stage for you
No more no more fuck that
Fuck that

[Verse 2]
Better watch yourself
Or you end up with a nigga
That you don’t even need
Better watch yourself
Or see me with a new bitch overseas
Better watch yourself
Or you see me in a Rolls Royce counting all this cash
Better watch yourself
Or you see me pull up on yo broke ass and laugh yeah
