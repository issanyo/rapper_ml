[Verse 1]
Waiting for you
Girl, it's been so long
I will take too long
I can't ignore
So, at this moment
It's better you say
You don't have to be afraid
'Cause this is your dream for me
When everything is said & done
Oh, we make till the morning sun
Fade away, I'm lost in your way
And I'll start feeling something
Fade away, I'm lost in your way
And I'll start feeling something

Oh, we make it till the morning sun
Oh, we make it till the morning sun

[Verse 2]
I felt for you deep into the late night
It was always the player cool, keep it safe tight
Know I've spent a lot of time walking on the wild side of wrong
A man, look into your eyes and I felt trapped, like
Damn, how you do that to me?
Damn, why you do that to me?!
I'm fuckin' with you if I'm speaking truly
I know the future looks dark
but we can make it through it
So let's go, and do it
God blessed your brain and I love when you lose it
Making love to you is best then making music
So, I'ma finish with this record
I'ma pull it through
You know I'm in a bad move when bulls pull
So I need two bless in the back
'Cause to me that's more funny than this bar
At the club I'm starting catching them ??
Like right at you, back up
The night is young
Are we make it till the morning sun?
