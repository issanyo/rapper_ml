[Verse 1]
Human made to fear God, genius who could that be?
I made a promise I ain't never, ever going back to last week
Made a promise, in the future every week gon' be a cash week
And me and YP running shit, it's a fucking track meet
A young Michael Johnson, or better yet, Usain Bolt
Shit I been running the city like Diddy, they be watching me just like with Vogue
Look, I roll up the smoke, get high with my fanbase, see I run this shit all my fans race
I wanna drop at my fans' pace, so I'm making shit every single day
And I'm a boss in every single way, these hating niggas never understand
But I got their bitch tryna fuck with me, fuck once, she gon' wanna fuck again
And tell her friends that Rockie pull up in Beemers but I might get the Benz
You know I come and get the ans
But this shit just started, my dearly departed
Still looking real young, when I buy liquor, I get carded
Still getting all the brain so I'm feeling like I'm the smartest
Bitch I'm super in my market, don't fuck around and be the target, don't start shit yeah
