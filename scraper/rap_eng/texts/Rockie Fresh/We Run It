[Verse 1]
Everybody knows, everybody knows
How the story goes, how the story goes
They say they've seen it all before, seen it all before
But with us you never know, with us you never know
OK, now you should know the motivation, gotta deliver
That's the topic of this conversation, and we ain't trippin'
We ain't rushin', we just stayin' patient, they always told me
If you want it then you gotta pace it, so we pace it

[Hook]
And I'm feelin' like we run it
Yeah, I'm feelin' like we run it
I said I'm feelin' like we run it
I'm feelin' like we run it
I do it different than they've done it
I do it different than they've done it
And I'm feelin' like we run it
Yeah, I said I'm feelin' like we run it

[Verse 2]
No comparison, this one on one
The sky is blue, where we in the sun
Got a lot with some Mordecoe
Since we in this, we just havin' fun
Mess around and we won't do a lot
We got everything we say we got
Do it how they never done it
Ask about us, tell 'em that we run it

[Hook]
