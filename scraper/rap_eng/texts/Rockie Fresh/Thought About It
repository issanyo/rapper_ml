Have you thought about it?
Have you thought about it?
Have you thought about it?

We can talk about it
We can talk about it
We can talk about it

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]

We can talk about life
We can talk about pain
And we can talk about the game
We can speak on what's true
And we can talk about me
Shit, we can talk about you
Tell me what you want to do
I know you're waiting on your turn
I brought something we can burn
I don't speak on what I earned
But I can tell you what I learned
I can tell you what I learned, yea
I figured out true love is a rare thing
A shooting star that most people just ain't seen
I understand that the hate made me smarter
But I'm trying to reach a point where I learn to love harder
It's no fun when you're faking all your feelings
My mind runs even when my body chilling
And bad times going to come that's a given
If you down to make it through swear I'm ready and I'm willing
They say pain can inspire a change
I lost my auntie that's why I ain't been acting the same
And niggas that I made throwing dirt on my name
But boys turn to men when you can stand in the rain
That's why I love bad weather, I love this pressure
'fore I never, break I never
They hate however my life just better
Than anybody try to front on my shit, fuck boy
I'm sorry I'm different
When I'm a hundred million up
Maybe people will get it
I always been about speaking things to existence
I rap for anybody that believes in their vision
I see things that they just can't see
Did I become something that they just can't be?
They say that the best things in life are free
And talk is cheap it's only two cents you keep
So I let mines go if the stocks arise
Maybe you can profit of what I prophezise
I mean it when I say I won't waste your time
And my number one fear is me wasting mine
But people like you are just hard to find
And people like me are almost extinct
And when people like us just happen to link
It's no telling what you can see
