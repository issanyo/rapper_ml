[Verse 1]
I'll murk you in some skinnies and some yeezy's
Not a gangster but believe me I go hard so take it easy, woah
Shit, I'm looking at my life I think I love it
I be smoking weed in public, wanting money so I touch it, woah
The game getting crazy, game getting much realer everyday
But I'm in it cuz it pay, woah
Shit lately we've been running through a maze
I've been high since that nigga Usher made that rock a wave
And I'm still double M G, riding with the team I came with
Kobe shit, shawty that was not a game switch
I'm on that straight and narrow, fast pocket
Gotta watch a nigga blasting off
Like a Houston rocket, James Harden
Yeah, We in the bank [?] time
Shit, I pull up on your bitch like it's lunch time
[?] first type of niggas
If you heard about [?] then we on our way to get ya yeah

[Hook]
Damn, I ain't a killer but don't push me
Don't do it
Damn, I ain't a killer but don't push me
Don't do it
See baby it's a problem, go on let me know
But if it ain't shit, I suggest you let it go
Take it slow, boy
Damn, I ain't a killer but don't push me
Don't do it

[Verse 2]
Niggas gon hate, that's always for the good
Working too hard just like they should
He on games all day okay, aye
She put me in, I make that play, aye
Okay I get it till I fade away, had to hustle state to state
Took it past that 88, now they can't read my license plate
You know I'm speeding while I'm eating till I'm overweight
I'm a skinny nigga but I really like the cake
I'm running shit so it's just like I'm back in shape
Shorty super thick make the earth quake
GPA 3.8, She was sleeping on me, now I'm up too late
Way too long, cooking left the stove on
Burnt the house down, getting top with my robe on
Yeah, I just want it all till it's all gone
Car drive when I was supposed to get call home

[Hook]
Damn, I ain't a killer but don't push me
Don't do it
Damn, I ain't a killer but don't push me
Don't do it
See baby it's a problem, go on let me know
But if it ain't shit, I suggest you let it go
Take it slow, boy
Damn, I ain't a killer but don't push me
Don't do it
