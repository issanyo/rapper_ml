[Verse 1]
Yea, I got so much to figure out
All because a nigga went and chose a different route
I got one life, I gotta make it count
I guess I’ll spend it tryna get it with these large amounts
People still wonder how I did it
I am the future, look at what I’ve invented
DeLorens, Lambos, yea I can whip it
My swag might have me like I need some bitches
Y’all niggas don’t get it, y’all settle for second
We wasted no time, we killed it on first impression
I can’t say you’re enough, I’m all about compression
That Givency look nice but who you think you impressing

[Hook x2]
And if you fuckin with this shit just lose it
Say if you fuckin with this shit just lose it
Right now you’re rockin out with Maybach Music

[Verse 2]
I followed my intuition, never paid that tuition
I just went with my vision, the top is what we get into
I’m the one these niggas gotta listen to
Shit, where I go these niggas don’t even mention you
Always follow my principle, every problem is minuscule
Now I’m feeling invincible, doin what I’m meant to do
I’m blessed by The Holy Ghost, Heaven high – the holy smokes
Never back to being broke, but out the part til they make the call
I’m icy bitch, come see the slope, they right – I’m on a different note
Do you get the message? I got credits on my records
If money ain’t the object, what the fuck is your objective?
A million, that’s impressive, I get it baby let’s live

[Hook]

[Outro]
Maybach Music
Say if you fuckin with this shit just lose it
You’re rockin with that Maybach Music
Right now you’re fuckin with Maybach Music yea
Yo girl
I didn’t believe that fuckin shit when I first heard it
And I can’t sing with all of this light
It’s just life
I tell them niggas roll that shit, light that shit
Live your life, don’t mess this shit
Tell my bitches roll that shit, light that shit
Live your life, don’t mess this shit
You only got one life
Roll that shit, light that shit
Live your life, don’t mess this shit
You better get it right
Roll that shit, light that shit
Live your life, don’t mess this shit
You only got one life
One life
So you better roll that shit, light that shit
Live your life, don’t mess this shit
Don’t mess this shit
