[Hook]

If I hadn't fallen away from what I knew
I fell down today and I can't move
Why are you asking me if you want the truth?
I feel lies and lullabies to you

If I hadn't fallen away from what I knew
I fell down today and I can't move
Why are you asking me if you want the truth?
I feel lies and lullabies to you

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]

Hopped up and took a shower
Played songs for an hour
While staring out the window of my tower
Ain't really sleep last night cause I was way too busy
Thinking 'bout the different ways
That I can learn to practice what I'm preaching
Nigga getting bigger, blowing swishers, fighting cancers
Everyday people swaying, I don't have all of the answers
My stripper chicks say I should make something for the dancers
My blog chicks say hip hop should go and up the standards
Tell me how you feel
Can these hypes fuck with someone that's chill?
Can niggas that I came up with be homies still?
We make moves when we tryna provide
I'd rather go and take a chance than to say that I never tried

[Hook]

If I hadn't fallen away from what I knew
I fell down today and I can't move
Why are you asking me if you want the truth?
I feel lies and lullabies to you

If I hadn't fallen away from what I knew
I fell down today and I can't move
Why are you asking me if you want the truth?
I feel lies and lullabies to you

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]

Gave my momma problems but she know I need her
Now I can give her money but I never see her
My main girl be trippin' but I never beat her
She tell me that she love me and I still believe her
Going back and forth with the games
It's tough love and we're calling names
The kush be helping with the pain
Get into an argument and smoke again
And again
So I can go on with the wind
Get a better feelin sometimes when I spend
But after all this shit I buy
Still I look in the mirror and I wonder why...why

[Hook]

If I hadn't fallen away from what I knew
I fell down today and I can't move
Why are you asking me if you want the truth?
I feel lies and lullabies to you

If I hadn't fallen away from what I knew
I fell down today and I can't move
Why are you asking me if you want the truth?
I feel lies and lullabies to you
