This is for them girls round the world getting stacks now
Every time you back up, we gone throw them racks down
We can do it all night, you ain't gotta back down
We be going hard mama we don't ever back down
You ain't gotta back down
You ain't gotta back down
This for my girls round the world getting stacks now
Every time you back up, we gone throw them racks down
We be going hard mama you ain't gotta back down

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
Chi-Town nigga, stepping on the scene
Catch me standing tall I don't really fuck with lean
I'm known to make them get money anthems for the team
But they still got a message like an answering machine
Shawty I'll fulfill your dreams, These other dudes sleep
I'm hoping you a freak, you ain't gotta be a creep
And call me up at night, I be getting hella D
Vibrating like my phone if you ever wanna beat
I'm workin' and she workin' everyday we hustlin'
Walk up in your party and make sure that bitch is bussin
My chick thick, real shit no fluffin
I'm a buy it all cause to make it back is nothing

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Shit, control em' like 2k, or whatever you play
Hoes get scratched trynna diss her like blue-ray
All of that drama, I make her have to chill on it
Tell her if she act right, i'll throw a couple bills on her
Spend they whole deal on it, she should let me feel on it
Ass so live I could probably roll my kill on it
And I take her higher, say them other dudes sweet
Actin' like they money strong, but really out here 2 weeks
Sayin' that they buying, but really out here too cheap
Fakin' like they caught, Martin Lawrence on blue streak
And niggas trynna mimic how we stuntin'
And I smash her every morning guess I'm really up and coming
