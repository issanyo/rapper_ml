[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
I really like to eat
I keep a couple girls that want to cook for me
Get us out their feelings when they look at me
Everything bape that's the look for me, yeah
Camo, camo, camo, camo
Lemme shoot my shot and I'ma turn to Rambo
Stepping out the ride in some Royal 1s
Ghetto nigga still eating honey buns
Pressure come but I move to a different drug
I'm just tryna stay low-key and get a band or somethin'
I know they say to each his own
But what you niggas on?
I mean I know its been a minute but I'm coming home

[Hook: Rockie Fresh]
Where I been?
I been on the move, I been on the move
I been on the move, yeah
Just let them know I'm droppin' soon
You should let them know I'm droppin' soon
I was way up there I mean way up there
I been going somewhere, somewhere
I was on the move, they was looking for me
Tell em I been on the move

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
I'm wicked with the wrist
If I ever take a shot know I will ever miss
If I'm fucking with that girl just know she benefit
Bitches start to get annoyin' lose their membership, yeah
I'm talking icy man
I fuck with Adidas but I'm still a Nike fan
I don't understand why these boys don't like me man
But I gotta go and get it, I'ma feed the fam
We switched it up, remember us
If niggas can't keep up they get left in the dust
We did it for the culture, young and dangerous
Shit, you bound to catch a blessin' if you hang with us

[Hook: Rockie Fresh]
Where I been?
I been on the move, I been on the move
I been on the move, yeah
Just let them know I'm droppin' soon
You should let them know I'm droppin' soon
I was way up there, I mean way up there
I been going somewhere, somewhere
I was on the move, they was looking for me
Tell em I been on the move

[Verse 3: King Louie]
I just got dressed lil' bitch on Rockie Fresh
Just mean send your BM home with cocky breath (my bad)
We ballin' hard like we shot the ref (do it)
Tony in the streets like Nike tech (woop)
When I pick her up she knock me down before I make my rounds
I'ma buy a circus for these goofies cause they really clowns
If you owe me money turn it over you went out of bounds
Groupies in my DM tryna link up when we out of town, (ha ha)
They know how we do she rode me in her Malibu (do it)
She come make me happy whenever she mad at you (do it)
My life radical, verses really actual (real)
Every sense the lower case I was the capital
They call me master when they see me cause I got the glow
He wanna smoke so when they see him had to tag his toe (woop)
Sliding like it's ice outside while it's light outside (ha)
Hot boy when I'm out it's always nice outside (woop)

[Outro: Rockie Fresh]
I been on the move, I been on the move
I been on the move, yeah
Just let them know I'm droppin' soon, yeah
You should let them know I'm droppin' soon
But, switch it up, give a fuck
Smoking weed blow it up
I do what I want..
