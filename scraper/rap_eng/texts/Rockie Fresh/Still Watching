[Verse 1]
Pass me the blunt and the aux cord
Freshest on the team, what you think I got a spot for?
I keep player, why, even need a lock for it
Niggas thought I fell off but I was on the top floor
Posted, why these grown  men on that ho shit
Life a roller coaster so be careful who you roll with
Future of the futons cause niggas gon' fold quick
Put 'em in a envelope and send 'em to my old bitch
Take this, hold that, think I need a skull cap
Freezin' out the break pads, cash in the airbag
So if I crash, I'ma prolly have 100 mil
Give it to the kids just to show 'em how that money feel
Think about ferris wheel, what was in the whip
I tried it on and it's lookin' like I fit the bill
Boy I'm always in the clouds, I ain't in the field
Touchdown, go and get a bag, then go up again

[Hook]
Damn, bottles still poppin'
Tried to stay lowkey but they still watchin'
Yeah, yeah, them niggas still watchin'
They be hittin' me every day, I guess I'm still poppin', yeah
Man these hoes, I've been tryna drop 'em
I've been on some chill shit but I still got 'em, yeah
Yeah I guess these bitches still watchin'
Tried to switch the number on her but she still callin'

[Verse 2]
Alright, now superbowl week I had a super bad freak
Shorty had a super dome with a super technique and
I think she like them skinny niggas far as I can tell
Shit I took her from a nigga in the NFL
Kush cologne, she love the smell, her favorite spell
She said Rockie Fresh the best, other niggas stale
I'm out that water with the sharks and the killer whales
Green diet, I'm talking kush, not talkin' kale
But shout out to Kellz
And that boy (?)
We was at your door way before my name was ringin' bells
Two rules -- never lose and we never fail
Same thing, same gang, bitch we some alpha males
I hit my girl up, it's time to go shoe shoppin'
Rubber band banks and the whole crew pop 'em
Switchin' up the moves, got a few options
Them niggas used to roll with us now they just watchin'

[Hook]
Damn, bottles still poppin'
Tried to stay lowkey but they still watchin'
Yeah, yeah, them niggas still watchin'
They be hittin' me every day, I guess I'm still poppin', yeah
Man these hoes, I've been tryna drop 'em
I've been on some chill shit but I still got 'em, yeah
Yeah I guess these bitches still watchin'
Tried to switch the number on her but she still callin'
