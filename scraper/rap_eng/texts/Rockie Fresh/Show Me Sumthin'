[Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
Yea, I hit the door, you ain’t drop the towel
Fuckin on the hunnids, girl collect the pow
You know you look good in your dickie style
I’m drivin 88, you go the extra mile
Kinda young nigga, upgrade your swag
You ever had balenciaga shoes and bags
You know this shit with the commas on the tag
Let me know if you can fuck with that
The jewelry boxes and my right boxers
We the shit, they gotta watch us
The tattoo that only show when you’re topless
Might be tattooed in my conscious
You telling me your ex, nigga gay you promise
You ain’t got a caller, I’m down to solve
That lavish I’ve been with that
If you show me something you can get it back

[Hook 1: Rockie Fresh]
You wanna get this money? Man show me sumthin
Show me sumthin, show me sumthin
Tired of your nigga then show me sumthin
Show me sumthin, show me sumthin
You really want a shot? Then show me sumthin
If you want it in the drop? Then show me sumthin
If you wanna see the crib? Then show me sumthin
If you really wanna live? Then show me sumthin

[Hook 2: Sasha Go Hard]
If you wanna be mine better show me sumthin
Better show me sumthin, better show me sumthin
If you want all my time better show me sumthin
Better show me sumthin, better show me sumthin
Got to get this cheddar, better do me better
When the time get right, gotta make me wetter
Show me sumthin, show me sumthin
Better show me sumthin, better show me sumthin

[Verse 2: Sasha Go Hard]
Can you show me the things I never saw?
Then prove the lies that he used to talk
The hold my hand while we walk the path
The same path, you could do the math
Go half and half, I’m willing too
Show you what a real bitch be down to do
I could crown the fruit, but truth on the truth
Are you down to do what I’m down to do?
Been eyeing you for the longest
Gotta have you like I’m homeless
Wanna be inside your heart, inside your mind, where you are the strongest
I believe what you want, you can have it all
No need to stunt, let’s make a call
Wanna be where you at, I’mma show you some (I’mma show you some)
I’mma throw you some (I’mma throw you some)
