(Verse 1)
Make money, love and music, stay focus , stack your own pockets
Bitch I get my checks out with no scratch, I'm like foamposites
Seeing is beleiving, sucker open your eyes
Dolce and Gabana wrist, show you I don't waste my time
On that grind, My future is bright, haters trynna Ray Ban my shine
Like Luther Vandross, thinking if this world is mine
New flows, getting new bitches, with my old circle, shit is too amazing
Soon enough, we getting double G's plus LV's up on the suitcases
Getting play out in New Jersy, Texas London, shit the greatest!
Never judge a book by it cover, but these hoes like to skim pages,
These hoes be acting up, but can't back it up
And these rappers suck
Cuz they wack as fuck
Bang bang head shot em
Baltimore we got em

HOOK

(Verse 2)
Catch a young nigga chilling in the cut like peroxide
No chicken, I popeyes
Crush competition with a rockslide
Free my brother Aaron, and my nigga Mike, they some real guys
Real eyes recognize real lies
Which reveals why I don't kill time
With these fake niggas
Real actors
Look forward but they live backwards
Non factors...Give em doubt
I live by my rep, you live twitter clout!

(Food for thought)
If you dont know it, then don't speak it
You don't learn than you can't teach it
Snitches never keeping secrets!

I'm an uncrowned king, busy looking for the throne
Don't let me into my zone, but I'm defiantly in my zone!

Mindset of a broke nigga working like I'm getting paid
Look out for CU, my shit is on the way!

HOOK

(Verse 3)
No Dylan, but spit hot fire,
Make a bitch stutter like Quagmire,
Knowing my shit hot, but these drag queens like to DoubtFire
Got a crazy chick that light your shit
Key your car, then slash tires
She from that westside, I make her scream louder than packed choirs
No fronting she bring it back
No puppeteers, no strings attached
I'm chilled relaxed
Just like my jeans
Working hard, for my team
And my fam, and the fans
All about supply and demand
Bitch I'm the man
GC, young nigga with a million dollar plan!
