[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]

Girl, you know I get caught up
I drink too much
Actin' like I don't give a fuck
I go out on the weekends
Just to spend so I can feel the love
But all that shit is fake as hell
You've got him by a mile
Saying that I know we haven't spend time in a while

[Hook: Rockie Fresh]

Please don't mind me let your hair down, girl
Never question this guy, you’re my world
Plus the sex is lit (yea, yea, yea)
Look at all the calls I missed (yea, yea, yea)

8 missed calls
Fucking hit'em in the morning
8 missed calls
Fucking hit'em in the morning

Fucking hit'em in the morning
And now a nigga zoning

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]

Usually I'm going Ghost
Love too sit close
It kills you and i fucking know
You've been holding it down
Even from a different coast
They wanna know, they always ask
Like where we been at lately
Always boast never brag
Don't tell them 'bout you baby

[Hook: Rockie Fresh]

Please don't mind me let your hair down, girl
Never question this guy, you’re my world
Plus the sex is lit (yea, yea, yea)
Look at all the calls I missed (yea, yea, yea)

8 missed calls
Fucking hit'em in the morning
8 missed calls
Fucking hit'em in the morning

Fucking hit'em in the morning
And now a nigga zoning
