[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
Ok the word around town rockie put it down
They been lookin' they been searchin' im the dopest that they found
Im about to be the king tell them boys give me the crown
My bitches mix my money green, what im sipping on is brown
Now im wasted, and im so turned up that I can't even taste it
But hoes say they love my charming as if im hanging from they bracelet
Soundin just like Avril saying "I'm so complicated"
And a lot of niggas hated they did not want me to make it
And the way the livin basic they know my flow has been nice
So I dont fucking boss hoes they sarah palin im glenn rice
Feel if I can hit once I can probably hit twice
But im too busy im gettin money im getting high and living life
Spittin fire with my dragon flows, no groceries but im baggin hoes
Little nigga in double XL and I ain't talking baggy clothes
These niggas no these bitches no there will be no equal
Im gettin paid I gotta it made my homie you know how we do

[Hook]
Haters I see through
We do not need you
Break bread with my people
Cause you know how we do
You know how we do x 5

These hoes are evil
We do not need you
Break bread with my people
Cause you know how we do x 5

[Verse 2: King Louie]
You know how I do
All I smoke is that gagoo
Tell em search me on google
They dont do it like lou do
Chop it up on 3 phones
Even though im 2 cool
Cash out weighs paper work
Lawless Inc, no pencil
Eyes light off emerald
Bad as Billy Jean you should improve
Beef is something we can do
Beat a nigga, instrumental
Top and bottom from the hottest hotties then kick em' out like the rent's due
They can't dream what i've been through
All I know is go hard
Still I make it look simple
Fresh as Rockie, got the heffers jocking
Bands in Robins
Because im clockin
Got a zero with no time to play
