[Verse 1]
Last night I had a nightmare
It's like the Devil doesn't fight fair
I got an angel in my bedroom
Might be going to the Heaven soon
So ask me what I'd die for
Wonders why I live that
All the time I spend on you
I'll probably never get it back

[Verse 2]
Wonder what the world holds
I wonder where my mind's going
I don't talk to my mama enough
I'm rolling weed, I smoke the drama off
I'm just tryina get my dollars up
So everyday I'm hustling, everyday I'm hustling
Say going back, broken back

[Verse 3]
'Cause there's some things I can never do,
Certain things I can never do, never do
'Cause I ain't going back to broken again
'Cause there's some things I can never do,
Certain things I can never do, never do, oh oh
'Cause I ain't going back to broken again
