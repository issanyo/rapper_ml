[Intro]
Hold me down, hold me down
Hold me down, hold me down
Hold me down, hold me down

[Bridge]
Say you get lonely, ride around the town
A lot of funny hoes be comin round
I need a bad bitch to hold me down
I need a bad bitch to hold me down

[Hook]
Hold me down, hold me down
Hold me down, hold me down
Hold me down, hold me down
Hold me down, hold me down

[Verse]
Yea, you hold me down and I may someday love you
Far from them other hoes, I’m known to rankle
You rode beside me as we ride through tunnels
Navigate into this paper that we stack in bundles
It ain’t nothing wrong with a rich nigga
Just take a look at what this shit gets you
I’m a big dreamer and a big spender
And every time I’m in your friend you get that big picture
Uh, I can’t believe it, you came in just damn time
Were what I needed, and you’re not like them other girls I meet every day
Say you stay down like them girls from around the way, around the way
You a smart girl, dumb ass but you got your own cash
You ain’t known to cut class, you ain’t known to fuck fast
A real nigga, ain’t nothing like these clowns
Got no time to fuck around but I can always hold you down

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Interlude x2]
Now all my girls around the world put your hands up high
Know you looking like a star when you’re in your rise
Just like hold you down, hold you down
And you can hold me down, hold me down

[Bridge]

[Hook]
