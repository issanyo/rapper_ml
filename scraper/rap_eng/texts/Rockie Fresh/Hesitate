[Verse 1]
Lookin' at the future
Tryna keep my focus
They say I'm out here winnin'
But Donald never notice
God is still the greatest
He workin' on my patience
I seen niggas turn on niggas
All for the love of entertainment
Ain't no other way to say it
This shit fucked up but we living in it
Amount of times they talk and people don't match the times they benefited
But it's all good cause I need the critics
Motivation to the way I'm spending
Motivation to the way I'm earning my blunt thick and this bitch burnin'
And all the shit I been through
Gave me my potential
Potential turned to power
Living like the world is ours
These people want us locked in
Everybody watchin'
It's like the cops wanna kill us
And then the block wanna kill us
So we ain't left with many options
Even though I am a target
I still gotta hit my target
And I came here with my own shit
I'm too proud to beg your pardon
I just wanna live a winner
I just wanna live a artist
Stars and life's on them better nights
I gotta get the shit regardless
My nigga

[Outro]
I'mma get this shit regardless
All my life I go the hardest
I'mma get this shit regardless
I don't wanna waste no time
I don't wanna waste no time
I don't wanna waste no time
Bitch better get it now
I ain't tryna waste no time
I ain't tryna waste no time
