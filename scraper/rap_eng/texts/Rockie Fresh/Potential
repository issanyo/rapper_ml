[Chorus:]
Ima love your physical and mental
Girl let's keep it real you got potential
She said what kind of deal can we get into?
I say fuck the label keep it simple
Baby you're special
You want me to help you
But you could do it on your own
Girl I think we both know
Baby you can be a star

[Outro:]
I can't lie this right here feel so right
I can't lie this shit here feel like life
Girl I can't like I might double back twice
Girl I can't lie I am down to pay the price
Tell me what's your price, tell me where to go
I already know, I already know
