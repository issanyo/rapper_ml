[Lucky]

Missed it, Missed it, you must've missed it.
Lucky just shook the game, fuck the hit-stick.
White bitches flirting with them niggas like Malcolm X.
But we ain't flirting back until we get to count the checks
Pull the cash out, they pull they ass out, stripping
If they ain't on the up and up, damn then we skip em. On a bad bitch hit list, fat bitch wish list, and O please dont forget about your mrs
Get your ass up pouting, looking all goofy
How you gone get boogie, because you can't afford the Gucci
Niggas hustle all day, just to party all night
Gone party Cuz, we gone make the music people party to
Get your checks up, your bread up, is what you ought to do
Fuck a bad bitch, she gone meet you when the rent is due....ladies what the henny do?
Gone take a drink or two
Party party, we like to party, slicker than laddie Dodie
Sicker than what you feeling after 10 shots of Bacardi. Whips all Ferrari, damn do I belong here?
Long hair, ass out
Tats all fucked up
Thicker than a snicker and her stomach all tucked up
Ask how many and I probably tell you just one fuck
Don't disrespect it
Leaders come in Leopard and the Jacket print is checkered
See the stars out tonight, they symbolize who in my house tonight
Get right for the love of unbelievable times of seeing my city shine, (ghost)

[Hook]
They ain't wanna see us shine. But you know we had to do it, tried to tell them but they didn't believe
Now they all looking stupid
Now they all with the movement (x2)
If you always on your grind and you wanna see us shine then you down with the movement
I say they down with the movement, they all down with the movement
If you always on your grind and you never drop a dime, then you down with the movement

[Rockie Fresh]
My girl stressing, she wanna smoke just to ease the pain
We don't hate but we know that love is a loosing game
We on that like shit, fuck never fight shit, come spend the night, and ill pay for the flight shit
I ain't trick but I got it, plus we dont really go on dates
We watch movies and the only thing I buy is Apes
She like my retros, she say she wanna role them grapes
I trust her so I ain't worried if its caught on tape
And if it is, then I swear I might lose it
I can never let her fuck with the movement
Its probably why Im better left alone
Me fucking other niggas bitches made me not trust my own
And I ain't tripping cuz we all get along
Take it by the weeks, while we all blowing strong
The drugs the only thing that influence
We had high thinking way before we start to do this
The Movement

[Chorus]
