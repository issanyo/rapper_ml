Uh, I stay reaching my goals
.. got cut but I’m the one that gotchose
Now I’m sitting on dough
Excuse me, I’m so fucking cold!
I said I’m so fucking cold!
I said I’m so fucking cold!
And niggas sitting on dough
Excuse me, I’m just Sofa King Cole!
…. I ain’t come here before
But I’m definitely on my focus
A lot of women battle to see who can get the closest to me
Me I crossed the line, so I guess the..
But I stay chilling, right where I’m supposed to be
..is chosen me
Ain’t nobody coasting me, ain’t no niggers over me
And they say money changes, so I hope these people notice me!
Hopefully they will learn to chill with all that whack shit
I see ‘em hangin’ with them squares like Patrick
You got the.. put me on the.. and I’ll be going for the…
…wild nigga riding like a cave man
So they quit.. like a..
I’m not a… but I’m certainly a …
So I started.. I wanna know my game plan!
Uh, I stay reaching my goals
.. got cut but I’m the one that gotchose
Now I’m sitting on dough
Excuse me, I’m so fucking cold!
I said I’m so fucking cold!
I said I’m so fucking cold!
And niggas sitting on dough
Excuse me, I’m just Sofa King Cole!
Tonight my rap is… clap
So if you like my rap, go ahead and clap
I know you like these raps go ahead and clap!
Said if you like these raps, go ahead and clap!
Oh, now is like so many wanna see you rap loose
They station..
But I didn’t choose to focus on the love that I receive
Get the money, I’mma get you some things that I’mma…
.. I feel like I’m the coldest, I got the…
..niggers got left behind
Now they see that I’m ahead, and expect me to …
Fuck that, they.. that ain’t among us
Them niggers are really out, but they hate just like uncle..
And when you got no bread is like you’re..
Only a nigga like me just … the life
I guess they’re mad, cause I’m busy, I am taking…
…give all that I got, and go pass…

Chorus:
Uh, I stay reaching my goals
.. got cut but I’m the one that gotchose
Now I’m sitting on dough
Excuse me, I’m so fucking cold!
I said I’m so fucking cold!
I said I’m so fucking cold!
And niggas sitting on dough
Excuse me, I’m just Sofa King Cole!
I done a lot, but I ain’t done enough
.. I don’t want above
..but I’m still moving up
I dug deep, but I found my diamond in the rough
And when they try to.. that is what I …
People show me love, but a lot of rappers been mad
Since I’ve been.. they always question if they’ve been there
… I tried to tell ‘em but they ain’t wanna believe ..
And I hang with the…. so they label us… leaders
Every time we’re taking.. we’re rocking leaders
Every time that they see us, they claim that it was meant to be
Real money, real dollars, not what I pretend to be!
I don’t claim bitches, I only claim victory
Uh, and I’m about to make history!
