Is it really meant to be
Is she the one that's meant for me
Should I act on what I feel
Cause she's the closest thing to real I've seen
I wonder what she's waiting for
I wonder what were waiting for
I don't want to push the limit
Cause I hear that less is more
But I want to tap into you
Take our love to something new
Cause I'm sick of staying in this spot
So now, so now, so now

I wanna make a move
I really wanna go
If you want me to stay
Baby just let me know
I can only go as far as you let me[x2]
I wanna make a move
I really wanna go
If you want me to stay
Baby just let me know
I can only go as far as you let me[x2]

As far as you let me[x4]
I only wanna go as far as you let me[x4]

See I can take it higher baby
I can be your dream
I just want to touch you baby
Right here on the ????
I can take you higher baby
Only if you let me
I can take you higher baby
Only if you let me

I only wanna go
I only wanna go as far as you let me [x2]
