[Hook]
Say we about it, tell ‘em we about it
A nigga say he get it like me, I doubt it
All about that money man, I can’t leave home without it
And we talking ‘cause we live it, yeah we really be about it
Say we about it, we really be about it
A nigga say he get it like me, I doubt it
All about that money man, I can’t leave home without it
And we talking ‘cause we live it, yeah we really be about it

[Verse One: Rockie Fresh]
Say we about it, tell ‘em we about it
I’m committed to commission, I collect it, then I count it
And a lot of niggas down it but it’s what the bitches down with
Looking for that next up out the Chi, think you found it
And you can keep on searching but won’t find no nigga realer
Just bought me a new Audi, pulled it fresh up out the dealer
Now your ho be trying to roll ‘cause I’m fly and smoke and kill her
Plus my chain be black and yellow, not from Pittsburgh but I Steeler
And I'm macking like Casilla, I got Cardo on the beat bitch
Got the fans waving, every show will make you sea sick
Blood season niggas salty ‘cause my pockets deep bitch
Hating on me, all seven days on some weak shit
We get whatever you want, know Rockie got ya
I’m the truth, these niggas lions just like Mufasa
Show stopper, so proper in that Baping shit
I got it early while you niggas on the waiting list

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Rockie Fresh]
We love risk so it’s only right we respect hustlers
We will like hate haters and we check lovers
Cali trees enjoy in threes, give me my best hovers
Man, I’m walking on these niggas, they my step brothers
Chick cuff us, hoes love us ‘cause we give them space
Never get too comfortable ‘cause anyone can get replaced
She with me, she smoke for free, y’all do them expensive dates
Sexing while I’m flexing, think your swag might need to hit the weights
See this pimping from afar, you gon’ get your squint on
Pull up in that old school, bitch, I think I’m Vince Vaughn
After she got through with me, she had to get her limp on
Before me, it went wrong, I got off, now it’s on
I’m bent on smashing and dashing, ashing and passing
Bringing the cash in but that’s all after the rapping
Making it happen, if I shoot it, then you can count it
Money surrounded ‘cause this young nigga about it, yeah

[Hook]
