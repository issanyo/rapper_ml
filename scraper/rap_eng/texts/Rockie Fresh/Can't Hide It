[Hook x2]
I say that Audi be clean when I'm driving
If she got ass then I'mma high five it
Put them legs on top of yo body
I got them phones them phones I can't hide it

[Verse 1: Sir Michael Rocks]
It's Rocks ho - Picasso
My Wardrobe looking like I cop dope
And my main girl throat it and do not choke
That Mazi throw the forks up but I'm not folks
Young nigga with funds, treat the hundreds like ones
Man I'm whipping whips and I grip the grain, wood grain on that pistol grip
Critics say that they hate the god, on vacation I take the squad
Man I needed that trip so my mind I can take it off
For all of this bullshit I deal with on the daily
Them hoes tryna be hoes, niggas tryna be shady
I wanna buy a boat and smoke a pack with my homies
Eat a couple lobsters, smack a couple phonies
Cause when we kick it it's a celebration
It's hella bitches thick several places
We smoking swishers like it's medication
I stay with Franklin but it's no relation

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Said it's a party in this bitch, the drinks stay on refill
Niggas had the game fucked up, watch us rebuild
Brick by brick, the view so sick
I'm staring out a window with this thick ass chick
Who got her legs parted like a space between cornrows
I be on the road getting cheese and more dough
You at home with it your delivery digiorno
If we ain't winning you're slow, when you see us you'll know
Everything is insane, chain to the whip game
Yo bitch about to fall victim to the pimp game
On the boat she selling, she on the hunt like Helen
I know what women want but to these niggas I ain't telling
And I ain't about that drama every time we gon' deflect
I be high stepping, got Balenciaga's on they neck
Bigger grind so I always went and got the bigger check
They ain't gotta like a nigga but I'm gon' get my respect
