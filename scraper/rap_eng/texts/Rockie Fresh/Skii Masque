Here's the deal lets talk the biz
Tryna get rich what da costs is
Negotiate terms with some bossesses
Ain't got the time for no lossesses
Run me the ducketts and don't make a sound
Get on yo knees nigga face on the ground
This more than bars this more than a round
Barking and biting ship me to the pound
Taking the crown and I'm burning the village
Dictating some killers bring me all of the
Pillage
Racking all yo riches take paintings and
Visage
Collecting the classics timeless & the
Vintage
Game of thrones ain't no scrimmage
Better keep the crown defended
I'ma get what's mine apprehend it
Skii masque on eyes demented

At ya neck
Give me what you got
Got my skii masque on and I'll crop ya top
All more money niggas
At ya neck
Give me what you got
Got my skii masque on and I'll crop ya top
At ya neck
Give me what you got
Got my skii masque on and I'll crop ya top
All more money niggas
At ya neck
Give me what you got
Got my skii masque on and I'll crop ya top

The truck getting hot steam coming off the top
One of us thinking who getting locked by the pops
It's almost crunch time your heart beating fast
If you nervous get out the truck we'll leave yo ass
No time for the snitching no time for the bitching
This gun on all our side was designed to do some lickin
Damn bruh forgot the plan run up in the house this shit is bland
Grab the money clothes and don't loose yo mans take what you can nigga that's the end
We rob and steal Mack on my back AK on right
Grip it tight Muhh fuckas get the blasting you better shoot back or you'll loose yo life
Uhh don't play wit It been waiting bit to get a taste of it
Rich white man rob us on the daily end so why can't a nigga get a a plate of it
Black man in a skii masque that's what they see they stealing our shit taken our money
Can't you see us whipping so annually flashing money that's what's wrong wit me
Ty rocks make it simple aim for the temple head shots popping black heads just like pimples
Blame it on us shit just do what you feel stand up and this robbery will become a Steal
