[Intro]
Twisting up my blunt thinking about my next dollar
Getting in the game trying to get some money out her

Twisting up my blunt thinking about my next dollar
Getting in the game trying to get some money out her

Twisting up my blunt thinking about my next dollar
Getting in the game trying to get some money out her

Twisting up my blunt thinking about my next dollar
Getting in the game trying to get some money out her

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]

Man life is good
Looking good
Gotta know a nigga stay fresh for real
This young gun is not in the army but they do say a nigga is dress to kill
Give two fucks how haters feel
I'm two busy trying to run the town
You ain't moving with my movement then get the fuck around
Rockie Fresh is world renown
So many hoes I don't know who to pick
And they ain't even going off what I got but they see what I'm about to get
Doing it like I don't give no shit
Somebody tell them I don't give a fuck
Real girls get down on the floor niggas put your bottles up

[Hook]

Cause they want it And I'm sipping
They losing while I'm still winning
And y'all wifing but I'm still pimping
And they worried but I ain't tripping

Cause I'm so gone(I'm so gone)
I'm so gone(I'm so gone)
I'm so gone(I'm so gone)
I'm so gone(I'm so gone)

But I do know one thing though
Women and men are hoes
Niggas here through Sunday Monday but soon they'll be expose
Maybe they'll love me one day, maybe they'll let it show
Until then I'll just keep rocking all these shoes and clothes

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]

Cause I be on some fly shit but bets believe this nigga is not the one
Get a lot of head got these hoes going dumb
Since I been on track others rappers on the run
I would do the same if I saw me in the game
Got a little change and I got a little fame
But all real niggas gonna feel this at the end of the day when they see that we the same
And this box shit is a habit
If I want it I can have it
I would take your girl but she too ratchet
The kid on point like I'm playing for the Mavericks
Fresh to death like I rap in caskets
But the boy is so alive
And I don't really care about the prize
Cause this Ros√© got me nodding

[Hook]
