[Hook]
The lights will lead you there
There’s no better life than this, I swear

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
The lights will lead you there
Some people say that this life ain’t fair
Y’all wonder how I got here
Lil nigga fuck around and had a big year
You know the smoke got it cloudy, but one things clear
That when them lights go down I have no fear
No I ain’t afraid of nothing
Got a lot now but I got some more coming
Coming from the city where the choppas steady drumming
And everybody wonder how I get to where I’m gunning, well...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Way before the watch and chain
Way before they knew my name
Way before all this fame
Way before the cars that came
I didn’t really care who fuck with it
I always wanted money, I’mma go and get it
You wit it, I’m wit it, you're bitch gon let me hit it
She wit it, I’m wit it, down
I done left shit alone
People still say I'm living wrong
But a nigga so gone
And I’m still gon reach that top spot I'm a high shot
More dough than your pop’s got
Thankful for everything that I’ve got
Look into the sky for what I’ve got, and...

[Hook x2]

[Bridge]
Damn, I really got my breakthrough
This what happen when you grind and stay faithful
Lot of people don’t get it but I’m grateful
Everything you’re not is the shit that make you
Never let em tell you what you can't do
Anything is possible, anything is possible
Just watch for the lights that glow, yeah

[Hook]
The lights will lead you there
(Close you're eyes)
There’s no better life than this, I swear
There’s no better life than this, I swear
