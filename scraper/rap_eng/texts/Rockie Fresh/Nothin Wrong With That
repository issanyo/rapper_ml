[Verse 1]
If you wanna drink that, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
If you wanna smoke that, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
If you tryna leave, shorty, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
You don't like a nigga, then it ain't nothin' wrong with that
You ain't tryna get it, then it ain't nothin' wrong with that
But if you tryna get it, then go on, shorty, throw it back
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
Young nigga gettin' money, It ain't nothin' wrong with that
Know I got the drink, and I've got to bring some strong with that
You don't wanna stay, so I wanna bring you home and back
To my crib, you lay up on my bed and get it in the sack
It nothin' when we stuntin', nothin' when we livin'
High as hell, I'm trippin' - fuck with me, I'm different
All these other niggas paint the perfect picture
Rollin' up my Swisher, I'm on my way to get you, so...

[Hook]
If you wanna leave, babe, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
If you wanna drink, babe, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
If you wanna smoke, shorty, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
If you don't like a nigga, then it ain't nothin' wrong with that
But go and tell a nigga, cause it ain't nothin' wrong with that
If you tryna leave, shorty, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, it ain't nothin' wrong with that

[Verse 2]
The life of the party, baby, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
Come and tell me what you want and I'mma go and order that
Bring you that, come and pick you up in them designer whips
Roll with me on a plane and we could take a trip
Italy and Tokyo, high as hell, we smokin' dope
We ain't never goin' broke, we ain't never goin' broke
I spend it if I got it, know that you're the hottest
These niggas out here talkin' but I swear they want no problems

[Outro]
If you wanna leave, babe, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
If you wanna drink, babe, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
If you wanna smoke, shorty, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
If you don't like a nigga, then it ain't nothin' wrong with that
But go and tell a nigga, cause it ain't nothin' wrong with that
I could find another bitch, then I'll probably throw it back
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
Lurking on my Instagram, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
Got them bitches goin' down, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
Any time you need me, just remember to hit my jack...
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
I be on some G shit, It ain't nothin' wrong with that
If you want the remix, It ain't nothin' wrong with that
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, it ain't nothin' wrong with that
