[Intro]
Yeah I'ma make you feel this shit

[Hook]
Okay I came back stuntin' too hard

Okay I came back stuntin' too hard

Okay I came back stuntin' too hard

[Verse 1]
Ight now Lord knows I been staying patient
I gotta get it, I ain't even waiting
If we talk shows then I Ricki Lake it
You ain't on the road, you ain't really caking
And that Jamo in me so I'm hella faded
Living life I already made it
But I still hustle just like I'm broke
Look at me like I'm moving dope
Nope, young Rockie just working trying to get the team on
Every day I been in the gym going hard trying to make the team strong
Baby girl you look right but something bout you seem wrong
And instead of getting that pussy from you, I rather go record three songs
I'm working, so we working
I roll a couple Backwoods then I'm burning
Niggas talk, I'm so determined
Living and learning
Said if we talkin' bout some money I'ma earn it
Niggas hate, I'm showing love, can't fuck with us
Plus I'm cool with all the bitches and the thugs
And I swear they know what's up, look where we at
Said I'm still everything these niggas lack
