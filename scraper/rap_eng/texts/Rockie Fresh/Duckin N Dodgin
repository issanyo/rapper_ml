[feat. Casey Veggies & Prod By Uncle Dave]

[Hook:]
A young nigga getting paper
Tell me do it now, but
I swear I'll do it later
Ducking and dodging, tryna stay away
From fake shit. Niggas wanna hate it
But the bitches wanna date us
[Casey Veggies:]
I live my life like bungee ropes and backflips
The I want it all like 20 hoes at Saks fifth
Yeah, Uncle Dave made the track hit
So I beat it just like I did my last chick
Rock the same sneakers, I don't remember
My last switch. Feel you on that same tip
Which means I'm never past tense
Yeah, shout-out to the Chi-Town
All I ever know is keep going and never
Drop out. Promoters be bogus homie
I need my cash now. Young Veggies and
The greens, that's for cash cows
And watch me milk it all out
Told myself, if I get a chance, I'm going
All out. The [?] is open, I'm tryna ball now
I got golden, she knows, she tryna call now
She's throwing, she knows I ain't gonna stall out
We give a damn what these rap niggas talk about
Hey young'un, my style is well thought out
I'm independent, you niggas think I"m caught out
Young nigga wiling, 30 thousand
On tour 40 miles and [?]

[Hook:]
A young nigga getting paper
Tell me do it now, but I swear I'll
Do it later. Ducking and dodging
Tryna stay away from fake shit
Niggas wanna hate us, but the bitches
Wanna date us
You know I got dollars and I'm always
On mine. I don't come around if she want me
But I'm always on time. Whenever I come!
Grinding and I'm knowing I'm a get my shine
And then in the front, so got to get in line
[Rocky Fresh:]
Mr Fresh up in this bitch
Now tell me can you handle it [?]
Put the heat on wax like a muthafuckin
Candlestick. Nigga lighting cannabis
[?]
Give a fuck if you a fan of it
Tell me I'm the man and shit, the truth
I do without lying. A hard worker and
I spit until my mouth tired
You heard I'm hostile, support me
Get my account higher, or you gonna act
Like Robin Williams in "Doubtfire"
I'm never tired cause I'm always on the rise
Models stay between the thighs
Cause you'll always be surprised
I'm just chilling with my guys on some
High class shit. Y'all graduate from lame
And get a master in disguise
That's why me and Casey winning
Cause we staying true to us, and these
Hoes be busting down every time we hit em up
Just to get dough, I swear ain't nobody
Give a fuck. Now I walked up in the game
Niggas running out of love - damn

[Hook:]
A young nigga getting paper
Tell me do it now, but I swear I'll
Do it later. Ducking and dodging
Tryna stay away from fake shit
Niggas wanna hate us, but the bitches
Wanna date us
Going hard, getting paper for a month or two
Put me on that old shit, she said she want
Something new. Grind it out and get it in
Like my mother do. Got up in the game
And a nigga getting W's...
