[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
I could probably get a deal for this, but na I feel I'm to real for this
Why you thinking he'll kill for this, when most people ain't built for this
Can't waste no time by the time that's built, they'll want something new
Can't waste no time by the time that's built, they'll want something new

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
I could see what they like to do
Wanna see it go wrong for me when it ain't right for you
It's cool, I keep my enemies close
Eyes wide open as I center the scope
Listen real well, don't be saying the most
There's one God, one Devil and I live with them both
Everybody don't fuck with you with the way you think they do
Only the lord knows what we been through
They want to drag me along, I'm in the studio working on every song
Tryna put a little peace in you
My biggest fears being right here next year selling y'all the same ass dreams
In the making of a movie that you haven't seen
In ten years you'll know what I mean, if anything

[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Look, I fucked around and got a deal for this
Sometimes I feel I'm too real for this
And the game so hype but I feel I'm to chill for this
Just want to make a couple mills and shit
See I'm tryna stay fresh in a world so filthy
Niggas of my own kind tryna kill me
Them boys in blue always trying to arrest me
But I still love life when I look at my prezzie
Man, draft shit like the NBA
Niggas want to make the league but they can't even play
Can't tell them that though, that's for certain
Nigga say he bored, then he just ain't working
See its a nigga that grind and he putting in the time
Cause he simply waiting on his season
And his pops got locked and his brother got shot
But they tell him to never stop believing

[Hook (x2)]

[Refrain: Dizzy Wright]
Can't waste no time by the time that's built, they'll want something new
They gon' want something new, they gon' want something new

These niggas don't know what real is, know what I'm saying man?

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
I used to deal with the bullshit all the time
Grabbed the pen and I draw the line
A boss is mine, follow my steps you could walk in line
Soak up game it don't cost a dime
Well I guess this a letter to me
You can't do me better then me
Half of these niggas don't come with a soul
That's the reason they sell it for free
Pay attention to what you telling the streets
I won't live a lie nigga
Unhappy tryna criticize niggas
I'm alive nigga, watching niggas get high with you
Cause they'll give you up for that dough
It ain't what it seem though
You complaining and you paranoid, you tryna make a scene bro
I ain't waiting for the green light, I'm bout to hit the gas through the red light
Hope you got your wings on, thoughts that you can lean on
Nigga!
