[Verse 1: Sam Bruno]
Hop out the ferrari, swirwin' through the lane
Hands all on your body, nah I ain't afraid
Your name on the list, dressin' out the place
You want this, you gettin' this, it is yours to taste, so what?
Daddy, we the party, don't look away
Take another drink and pour it down my drain
1942 made me feel awake, whatcha wanna do?
That's what we do, we blow the way, so what?

[Chorus: Sam Bruno]
Feed me what you wanna feed me daddy (daddy)
Eat up what you wanna, it's all your candy (candy)
Feed me what you wanna feed me daddy (daddy)
Eat up what you wanna, it's all your candy
You ready? I'm ready

Say what you wanna say about us
Roll it up, breathe it down, light it up, I smoke it out
Bring it to me, blow it out, open mouth, shut it down
Bring it to me, light it up, open mouth, blow it out
Open mouth, blow it out, breathe it down, so what?

Feed me what you wanna feed me daddy (daddy)
Eat up what you wanna, it's all your candy (candy)
Feed me what you wanna feed me daddy (daddy)
Eat up what you wanna, it's all your candy
You ready? I'm ready

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Yeah, Rockie checkin' in
Yeah, if you spend the night with me
You gon' want a life with me
You never had to fight for me
I'm everywhere you like to be
So that's right, put in work, move that ass, throw the shirt
Know I love to watch you twerk
I'mma let you finish first
Take my time and I'm in a slow-motion (slow-motion)
Guess I'm turnin' out to be all that you hopin'
Got your focus, got you swimmin' in an ocean, got you wet
And them other girls gon' have to show respect you worked the check

[Bridge: Sam Bruno]
We were high the night before
You said I show you mine, you show me yours
We were high the night before
You said I show you mine, you show me yours

[Chorus: Sam Bruno]
Feed me what you wanna feed me daddy (daddy)
Eat up what you wanna, it's all your candy (candy)
Feed me what you wanna feed me daddy (daddy)
Eat up what you wanna, it's all your candy
You ready? I'm ready

[Outro]
So what?
So what?
So what?
