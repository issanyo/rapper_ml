[Hook: Fat Trel]
Double M where the best at
Still shootin' where your chest at
My pinky ring will rock you
My little bitch like "Where that nigga Fresh at?"
Where the racks, where the stacks, where the checks at?
Drop a stack, leave him dead where he left that
So many semi bullet holes, I regret that
Scratch that, run it back like an 8 track
Nigga, I'm fresh, Rockie
Say the police try stoppin' me, I got next
I know them lame ass niggas gon' copy this
Cause I'm fresh, Rockie
Say the police try stoppin' me, I got next
I know them lame ass niggas gon' copy this

[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
I'm in Chicago, with Rondo, smoking dope in Fredo condo
I just got a new Rolex, still got no time for the convo
The way I pull the gas out the bag
Shit stink real bad, you would think I had a lawn mower
100 round choppa on the flo'
What the fuck a nigga like me need a alarm for?
Pull up on a strip in a 006
Hit a switch bullshit and i can flip a brick quick
Couple handbags and a pair of red bottoms
And a flight and a dick, that's what a bitch get
See me when I slide, 45 on my side
If I lie, I'mma die, Im rich
Killer in my eyes, I'm just tryna' stay alive
If I ride for my side, I'm with it
I'm the best, I'm the fresh, get whipped
30 shot clip, leave a nigga lip zipped
Slutty Boyz shit, we live this shit
When I first met Rockie, my gift was this, shit
Take a nigga life with the left right wrist
In the heat of the night, I'mma shine light bright
Squad on my arm and I ball like LeBron
But I really want rings like Mike
You can try but I really don't fight
Drinkin' lean, finna' catch me a flight
I got a new young bitch I like
You know I'm tryna eat the pussy real slight
I told Juice boo come spend the night
I got a new coupe that you just might like
If she let me through, I'mma do like Vike
Maybach so I know she like it

[Hook]
Double M where the best
Still shootin' where your chest at
My pinky ring go rocky
My little bitch like where that nigga fresh at?
Where the racks
Where the stacks
Where the checks at
Drop a stack leave him dead where he left that
So many semi bullet holes i regret that
Scratch that run it back like an A track
Nigga im fresh
Rockie
Say the police try stoppin' me
I got next
I know them lame ass niggas gon' copy this
Cus im fresh
Rockie
Say the police try stoppin' me
I got next
I know them lame ass niggas gon' copy this

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Cause I came from the dope and I'm fresh as a bitch
Niggas be talking but fuck it, I'm rich
They don't get the swing cause they not in the pitch
I don't give a fuck, is it wrong to admit?
Benjamin Franklin, Benjamin Wilson
Can I ball for the children?
You ever pay bills for your family
I swear it's a wonderful feelin'
Like why you think young niggas hustle?
Is momma worth gettin' in trouble?
See we gotta fight, gotta scuffle
Cause life is a bitch and it ain't got no muzzle
These niggas be barking, they so out of line
Cause it's harder to stay in the margin
Now they callin' on me but this shit is just dead
And I am not in need of no charger
I am the 2Pac, the [?]
Are you aware of the shit that you startin?
Are you clear on the costs?
Shit getting found and shit getting lost, man
Please talk to us in the right tone
We just tryna live our life long
Get paid on the right soul
Post up, smoke blunts on the ride home
Now I don't even know why you wanna stop that
You should be runnin' with us with the top back
We can be overseas with a bitch
We can French her, we ain't gotta ask her to pop that
Niggas ain't gon' get it, you know I'mma guess that
But I was only tryna win and I just hope you respect that

[Hook]
Double M where the best
Still shootin' where your chest at
My pinky ring go rocky
My little bitch like where that nigga fresh at?
Where the racks
Where the stacks
Where the checks at
Drop a stack leave him dead where he left that
So many semi bullet holes i regret that
Scratch that run it back like an A track
Nigga im fresh
Rockie
Say the police try stoppin' me
I got next
I know them lame ass niggas gon' copy this
Cus im fresh
Rockie
Say the police try stoppin' me
I got next
I know them lame ass niggas gon' copy this
Cus im fresh

[Outro]
Still shootin' where your chest at
My pinky ring go rocky
My little bitch like where that nigga fresh at?
Where the racks
Where the stacks
Where the checks at
Drop a stack leave him dead where he left that
So many semi bullet holes i regret that
Scratch that run it back like an A track
Nigga im fresh
Nigga im fresh
