[Intro: Fuzzy Jones]
Well, it is a weepin' and a moanin' and a gnashin' of teeth

It is a— when it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
Believe, believe

[Chorus: YB, Big Sean & Fuzzy Jones]

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I’m rocking bally, walking the valley of death
Vacheron cost a Lambo, you niggas in debt
I ain’t want to fuck your girl, I just wanted a fresh
After BIG, Puff told me I was the best
Still is that top nigga
Cocaine, Ciroc nigga
Pull up on that yacht nigga
Detectives know I’m hot nigga
Hostile, mob style, Rothchild's
Trench coat, half cal, my dick hang to my calf now
Real nigga, I woke up with a kilo
Real bitch, keep kissing on my pee hole
Paid in full, bitch I think I’m Rico
It’s Rozay, I sold food like Cee-Lo

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
I’m in that Lamborghini drop top
Gunning for the top spot
Gold Rollie, my watch froze
You would think the clock stopped
Countin hella 20’s, get into my dreams
Ballin with my niggas
Your girl gon' fuck the team
Now I been off that Jameson so I might need her name again
I came to win, she’s just tryna kick it like it’s 4th and 10
Give it as she gon run it back
Her legs spread like a jumping jack
Her other man, he hella whack
And he don’t stack it like Rockie stacks
Seen more clothes than a laundromat
More whips then Kunta back
Like racism, I’mma be around
So y'all niggas get used to that

The bugle has blown fi many times
And it still have one more time left
Cuh the amount of stripe weh deh pon our shoulder

[Bridge: Kanye West & 2 Chainz]
Let the suicide doors up
I threw suicides on the tour bus
I threw suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm the shit
Tell 'em gimme fifty million or I'ma quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-yo-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press kit
Plus, yo, my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin' 'bout Mary, she gone off that molly
Now the whole party is meltin' like Dalí
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move in the lobby (yah)
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans (2 Chainz)

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz & Big Sean]
Okay, now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane (tell 'em)
Spit rounds like a gun range (baow)
Beat it up like Rampage
Hundred bands, cut your girl
Now your girl need a Band-Aid (damn)
Grade A, A1
Chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds, backpack rhymin'
Co-signed by Louis Vuitton (yep)
Horsepower, horsepower
All this Polo on, I got horsepower
Pound of this cost four thousand
Now I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain (rain) pourin' (pourin')
All my cars is foreign (foreign)
All my broads is foreign (foregin)
Money tall like Jordan

[Chorus: YB, Big Sean & Fuzzy Jones]
