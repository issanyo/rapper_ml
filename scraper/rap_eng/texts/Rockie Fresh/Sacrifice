[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
My mind on the highway, my vision on tunnel
And good pussy I run through, you lettin' that run you
Man what have you come to? Why your living so untrue?
Niggas be lying, aye on my life, I swear these niggas be lyin'
We see that shit early, we good on your stories
I don't wanna know like I'm Mario Winans
And so I be grindin'
I'm sick and tired of seeing my momma providin'
She should be ridin' in a car
That's respected like she just come through with them sirens
Eat with the lions
And I'm startin to see a lot of you animals dyin'
On thin ice where the young boy glidin
Smoking on a plane, on my way to a island, stuntin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
She know that I got it
I know what you like and I know what you want
Just let me provide, like Ne-Yo
I know I'm the one, it's just inside me
When I first saw you at the party
I fell in love with your body
And then I just get in your mind
And see that you workin with all of this knowledge
I fuck with you girl, ain't tryna judge what you doing
We stuck in our world like Boy Meets Girl
You could be my young Topanga
My girl be happy for me and she love me
But I think she mad that I'm famous
Money and pussy make the world go round
Spit that straight game and your girl go down
Thug life tatted across my chest
Versace shades they on my eyes
Hundred bands, I don't own no wallets

[Hook]
