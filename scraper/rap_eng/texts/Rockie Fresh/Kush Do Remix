[Verse 1: Rockie]
She say she like the sight of a nigga with vision
She say them corporate niggas boring, she want a musician
She know them hoes gon' hear my phone, she don't even be trippin'
She know she good just as long as she play her position
She so wet, tried to step and was sliding and slipping
She used to be a cheerleader, was splitting and flipping
She know a lot of niggas ballin' be hittin' and dippin'
But could Rockie be different?
Some hoes they say I be playin'
Don't hear shit that they're saying
I'm just history-making, you know the time that be taking?
Got no time to be faking, speak on what is true
And every time I'm gettin' high, then all I think about is you, yeah...

[Hook: Rockie]
I don't know what this kush do, but I think of you when I get high
I don't know what this kush do, but I think of you when I get high
I don't know what this kush do, but I think of you when I get high
Think of you when I get high, think of you when I get high
These other hoes they hate on you, but you find a way to get by
That attitude and that way you move
And your clothes and shoes just too fly
I don't know what this kush do, but I think of you when I get high
Think of you when I get high, think of you when I get high

[Verse 2: Wiz]
Think of you when I'm faded...
Think of you as my favorite...
Think of you when I'm smoking...
Think of you when I'm skating...
Think of you and no other hoes
So they think of you and start hating
Think of you when I'm balling
Let you count the money I'm making
We rollin' up...
It's going down, it's going down
When we showin' up...
Got a joint rolled, another joint rolled
A bong loaded up...
She even reps the gang when she's taking pictures
She's throwing it up...
Pour some gin, you're a ten
Goin' in 'til I'm finished
Girl your pussy ain't the same unless a real nigga in it
I'mma hit it like a habit
Turn you over and grab it
Love that kush and OJ
So I'mma roll one and stab it

[Hook x2: Rockie]
