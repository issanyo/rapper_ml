[Verse One: Rockie Fresh]
She said I’m just a chick you’ll have relations with
Really wanted more but you’re not fit for a relationship
Life is moving fast, I don’t think your aim is pacing it
‘Cause I can never be the blame if you don’t end up making it
And if you do, then I gotta hear them rumors
I don’t trip over your past but your past trips into my future
I hear things that I ain’t wanna know, you say it happened long ago
But I think that you lying ‘cause I feel I should’ve known before
And on another note, I don’t think you have the time for love
I may make it farther than your grind who always rise above
Everyday a different show, every night another club
And when you out of town, it’s just like we out of touch
And I ain’t tripping ‘cause you meant to be a star
Said you going for the green and your swing is up to par
So before I realize that I’m the fallen who you are
I suggest you make a move before it goes too far

[Hook]
You gotta go, you gotta leave, you gotta move before it goes too far
You gotta go, you gotta leave, you gotta move before it goes too far
You gotta go, you gotta leave, you gotta move before it goes too far
You gotta go, you gotta leave, you gotta move before it goes too far

[Outro]
As far as you let me, I only wanna go as far as you let me
I only wanna go as far as you let me, I only wanna go as far as you let me
I only wanna go as far as you let me, I only wanna go as far as you let me
As far as you let me, it’s gone too far
