[Hook: Hit-Boy]
Who the nigga gettin' all that dough?
That my whole circle
Take ya bitch, She won't call back home
That my whole circle
Hit the party, We blow that loud
That my whole circle
Them my nigga my bro my round
That's my whole circle

[Bridge: Casey Veggies]
Ain't no squares in my circle(x9)

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I'm a young fly LA nigga
And ain't no squares in my circle
She down to ride, She let me film
Might put her ass in a commercial
And rep the team, that's a good look
Got the recipe in the cookbook
She naked, taking pictures for the look book
And the boy bout to hit like a good hook, She going
Baby girl always see me out when we be tourin'
Only 19 but i'm pulling up in that Foreign
Square niggas tryna' block
She taking shots and I'm scoring
They pay a lot, So I blow it
She shake a lot, So I throw it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Put this shit on Shaq bitch
We ain't backing down
My business pitch can get my Cy Young
When I'm at the mound
I heard yo ho was looking for me
I was out of town
London and Amsterdam
I am world-renowned
Money coming to me, Money coming to me
How I feel?
I'm getting grants, My bitch be thinking she Tamia Hill
I'm out here working like a nigga
Never signed a deal
And I'm gon' off the purple nigga
Ain't no squares in my circle nigga

[Hook]
