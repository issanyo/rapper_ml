[Verse: Rockie Fresh]
I feel my only job, do what I gotta do
I always keep it real, I always keep it true
Never make it rain, the sky is baby blue
Are you a detective? Do you want a clue?
I'm in to take a chance, I don't have all the answers
I don't really plan, I like to do it random
The girls say I'm handsome, but what that really mean?
I'm always lowkey, I'm never on the scene
I don't think about me, I think about the team
And all the brothers in the struggle, they're just tryna let it dream
I got em hooked, I'm feeling like Corinne
From the classroom to the magazine
See, it's a dirty world, I try to keep it clean
I'm working all day, I am a machine
Tell me what you mean, tell me what they say
Yeah, I'm in the game, I got no time to play

[Hook: Rockie Fresh](x4)
I've been away for so long
I can't wait to go home
