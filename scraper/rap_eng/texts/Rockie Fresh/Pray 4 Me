[Verse 1]
I'm afraid of myself more than anyone else
I'm still lookin' in the mirror when in need of some help
They assissinate my character and swing for the belt
But I still feel gifted when my presence is felt
Tryin' take me out the game but you know Imma stay in
Only thing on my mind go hard, straight win
Lookin' at these niggas like why we can't stay friends?
I pray Meek Mill and Drake work again, Amen
I forgot I signed up for all of these wild days
I need two shots just for all of this foul play
I hit a far ball when I was tryin' to reach homebase
My haters struck out, I'm like speak for your own case
Yeah, lately I been viewin' thing differently
While ridin' on my mission I ain't crash today
Could've not woke up, could've past away
I'm startin' to see what the pastor say
I have to say damn...

[Hook]
I know somebody prayin' for me
Somebody prayin' for me
Somebody love me like they say they love me
Thank God, somebody prayin' for me
Situations gettin' ugly
Found the beauty in struggle now they can't touch me
I know somebody prayin' for me
Somebody somewhere prayin' for me

[Speech [?]]
Fight so hard that you bring a stop in the defense of all
You can't even be creative but you been through so much trials to survive
That you have forgotten what it felt like, when you were free

[Verse 2]
This made me think about my high school crush
Back when missy used to tell us to pass that dutch
At 16 it's that shit, you pass that blunt
It's a real easy score anytime we layin' up, yeah
Fast break to the bedroom each day
Puttin' up "Highlights" need a replay
Now it's every other week I gotta switch states
Cops killin' niggas and it's hard to find a safe place
Treat me like ingrate, lunch room, big plate
Still gotta eat though easy as a free throw
And I ain't got no time for no weakos
I ain't fuckin' with no cheap hoes, Lord knows
Could've been a whole lot deeper but a lot more simple I been stayin' on your mental
And the city kills dog men without a pencil, only God knows what they been through

[Hook]
I know somebody prayin' for me
Somebody prayin' for me
Somebody love me like they say they love me
Thank God, somebody prayin' for me
Situations gettin' ugly
Found the beauty in struggle now they can't touch me
I know somebody prayin' for me
Somebody somewhere prayin' for me
