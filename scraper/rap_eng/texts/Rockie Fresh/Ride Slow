[Verse 1]
I've been working all day, waiting for tonight
Roll my first blunt now I'm feeling right
Jamo in my cup, let's turn up tonight
Bitches trying to fuck, let's turn up tonight

[Verse 2]
Seen the sun go down, see your bitch go down
Seen my money go up, make sure my shit don't go down

Substract where I'm at and bitch you see the sweater

Killed this shit it's on a stretcher

[Hook x2]

[Outro]

Going to different cities, back in these different shows
All theses hoes, love it
