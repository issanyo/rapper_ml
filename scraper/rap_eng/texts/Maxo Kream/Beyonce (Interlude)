[Chorus]
Maxo, Waka Flocka, Draco, baby chopper
Maxo, Waka Flocka, Draco, baby chopper
Maxo, Kevin Costner, my choppa won an Oscar
Maxo, Frank Sinatra, my choppa sing like opera
My Draco sing like Drake though, Beyonce and Quavo
Got more guns then Halo, more bodies than J-Lo
My Nina sing like Tina, Patti and Aretha
Matchin' Desert Eagles, Brandy and Moesha
Trap outta Pack-a-stan, smokin' on Afhanistan
Trap outta Pack-a-stan, took a nigga pack, I ran
Serve with the Glock in hand, infrared dot, Japan
Never sit down, I stand, Kreamgang Taliban

[Verse]
Pull up with that burner like I'm Wiz Khalifa
Prices on the reefer, come and get them cheaper
Hop out with that Drac' like I'm Jas Prince
Choppa blastin', leave a nigga past tense
Servin' bomb like Bagdhad, break it down and bag that
Servin' bomb like Bagdhad, break it down and bag that
Afghani gas pack, Maxo servin' anthrax
Maxo got Bin Laden straps, baby Draco, TECs, and Macs

[Chorus]
Maxo, Waka Flocka, Draco, baby chopper
Maxo, Waka Flocka, Draco, baby chopper
Maxo, Kevin Costner, my choppa won an Oscar
Maxo, Frank Sinatra, my choppa sing like opera
My Draco sing like Drake though, Beyonce and Quavo
Got more guns then Halo, more bodies than J-Lo
My nina sing like Tina, Patti and Aretha
Matchin' Desert Eagles, Brandy and Moesha
Trap outta Pack-a-stan, smokin' on Afhanistan
Trap outta Pack-a-stan, took a nigga pack, I ran
Serve with the Glock in hand, infrared dot, Japan
Never sit down, I stand, Kreamgang Taliban

[Outro]
Swanton Bomb, Jeff Hardy
Ride with the chopper like Harley
Leave a nigga wet like gnarly
Chain on Hurricane Harvey
Wrist and my neck throw parties
Neck on chill like a kickback
Fuck around, bring a TEC to a kickback
Hundred round, boom boom, no kickback
