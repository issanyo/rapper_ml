[Chorus]
Pesos, Dracos, still serve movin' packs in the vaco
Botox, faceshots, pop at a nigga top 'til the K lock
Call Bobby, do a homi'
Cheerleader, trampolines, catchin' bodies
Slide off with your ice like hockey
Shoot shit, take shit, that's my hobbies
I wish a cluck-ass nigga would try me
Put the lead in his skin like an IV
Bulldog, longnose, call him Scotty
Four shots to his chest, that's an Audi
Smoke dope, sip dope like coffee
Cook coke, chop dope like karate
Cutthroat, sell soap to my auntie
Sell hoes, slang dope for my hobbies

[Verse]
I like to sip codeine when I pop Xanax
Like to serve whole things, QP's, grammies
Might make a dope fiend hand wash a Caddy
Might make a dumb hoe think I'm daddy
Fuck around built an empire like Lucious
30 clips droppin' out like a dumb student
Fuck around beat the pack down, I'm abusive
Retarded-ass Crip, handicapped, go stupid
Zips of the powder, K packs of the downers
Bouquet of the flowers, my trap so romantic
Robbin' me stupid, I'll shoot you like Cupid
Your mom puttin' tulips inside of your casket
Plastic man black with the dealer plate tags
Hear the engine Hellcat make the car sound Jurassic
I make them boppers and all of her partners go topless for dollars, they workin' at Magic
Her titties are plastic, she really a catfish
My neck is Alaskan, my wrist do gymnastics
Stretch work like elastic, my pack acrobatic
My smoke boombastic, my trappin' fantastic

[Chorus]
Pesos, Dracos, still serve movin' packs in the vaco
Botox, faceshots, pop at a nigga top 'til the K lock
Call Bobby, do a homi'
Cheerleader, trampolines, catchin' bodies
Slide of with your ice like hockey
Shoot shit, take shit, that's my hobbies
I wish a clunk ass nigga would try me
Put the lead in his skin like an IV
Bulldog, longnose, call him Scotty
Four shots to his chest, that's an Audi
Smoke dope, sip dope like coffee
Cook coke, chop dope like karate
Cutthroat, sell soap to my auntie
Sell hoes, slang dope for my hobbies
