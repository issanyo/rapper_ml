[Hook]
You better get your roach ass, broke ass, never gettin' no ass
"Maxo, let me get a picture with you"
You better get your bitch ass, snitch ass
Tattletale, quick fast, never hit a lick ass nigga
Girl you better get your no class, no ass, broke stripper, broke ass
Suckin' dick for Instagram pictures
Girl you better get your welfare, loan stars, stay with momma, no car
Baby daddy never in the picture
I was never fuckin' with you
Peon ass nigga, I don't fuck with none of y'all
Friendly ass nigga, I don't fuck with none of y'all
Boppin' ass bitch, I don't fuck with none of y'all
Wanna hold a conversation, nigga money talk
Goddamn Maxo, see you shinin', livin' good, (Good)
Matte black Rover turnin' heads in the hood
Pole jockin' ass nigga, stay the fuck up off my wood
Talk down on me now, man I wish a nigga would

[Verse 1]
Boy you better get your bitch made, fake raps, fake gangs, fake traps
Scared to catch a fade so you walk around with two straps
Friendly ass, mark ass, twinkie, pop-tart ass
Walkin' with them dogs but you never let them bark ass
Weak ass, squeak ass, hood hoppin', flip floppin'
Homie killed you nigga and you still ain't get it poppin'
Scary ass, fairy tale, talkin' dope you never selled
Bondin' out on misdemeanours, never did a day a jail
I'm a stumped down nigga cut from a different cloth
You a pussy ass nigga, I can smell you from afar
Twitter beefin' with emojis kinda shit that we don't ball
Pull up to you momma droppin' 5-56's, hit her car
Same niggas talkin' down, same niggas in my face
Same niggas hit my line, same niggas player hate
While your broke ass layin' on the couch I'm goin' state to state
Niggas janky, I ain't friendly with you niggas anyways

[Verse 2]
Young nigga had to get it, ten toes
Never gave a dollar to a stank hoe
Remember me and big Stevie used to share clothes
Now I don't pass blunts but I share hoes
Funky bitch can't get no man so she walk around with dildos
Bitch ain't got no walls so the homies call her field goal
Always up in somebody business you pretend yours
Talkin' about they next bitch, what the fuck you hatin' for ?
Baby daddy in jail now you fuckin' all his partners
Turnin' cheeks for free, you ain't makin' no dollars
Hoodrat bitch, talkin' loud, havin' squabbles
Posin' naked on the Gram, fake internet model
Lil' momma talkin' down but talk is cheap
Always in somebody business, need to do you hair and feet
Steady flappin' you dick suckers, gossip talkin' all that shit
Need to get up off you ass and get some money
Funky chop ass bitch
