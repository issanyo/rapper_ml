[Intro: LilCJ Kasino]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Kasino shit nigga
Maxo Kasino shit nigga
It's YL on Dem 808s
Maxed out fucking with us
Nah for real

[Chorus: LilCJ Kasino]
Pull up to my trap, you knock at the back door
We super stocked, we got whatever you ask for
Nike drawers lil nigga, I gotta tax though
Flip the packs, start pulling racks out my asshole
Lil boy don't get shot in the face tryna act bold
Don't need me no liquor, that's what they made Act for
Come through that bitch dripping, he like, "Where his neck go?"
You losing, I'm booling but cooling with Maxo
This that Texas shit, that real reckless shit
Pull up, go to stretchin' shit, bullets start fetching shit
Ain't no checking shit (No way), please don't test this shit
You know them ape niggas deadly
Might send you to heaven the way we be blessing shit

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Maxo, Maxo, Maxo, uh
Fake O scale in the pot
Draco, Glocks, keep the door unlocked, ayy ayy
Traphouse jumping off the meter
Piles in the trash can, pints in the freezer, whoa whoa
Obama gas bag like the president
Just finesse on the plug with the counterfeit
Shoot shells, fuck 12, they ain't taking shit
Been dabbing persona and etiquette
Maxo El Chapo, bitches suck me like it's lipo
Suck that dick, look like a light pole, what? Double cup my Styro'
Headlines like a typo, ayy
Crash dummies, no Geico, whoa
Thirty-eight special for pressure (Let's get it)
Whip up and bag up them extras
Like Mike ass nigga, like Bow Wow
I'll up the pipe, make a nigga pipe down
Up the pole like a motherfucking stripper
Shooting drills like an LA Clipper
Gucci Gang, Kream Gang
Banana clips, orangutan
Halfways, whole things
Beat a rap nigga up then I take his chain, gang

[Chorus: LilCJ Kasino]
Pull up to my trap, you knock at the back door
We super stocked, we got whatever you ask for
Nike drawers lil nigga, I gotta tax though
Flip the packs, start pulling racks out my asshole
Lil boy don't get shot in the face tryna act bold
Don't need me no liquor, that's what they made Act for
Come through that bitch dripping, he like, "Where his neck go?"
You losing, I'm booling but cooling with Maxo
This that Texas shit, that real reckless shit
Pull up, go to stretchin' shit, bullets start fetching shit
Ain't no checking shit (No way), please don't test this shit
You know them ape niggas deadly
Might send you to heaven the way we be blessing shit

[Verse 2: LilCJ Kasino]
Play with Kasino, that's deadly shit
Young nigga flexing and sipping on medicine
Fuck up the spot, we been dropping, no stretchin' it
Thirty round Glock, play and he catching it
Pull up tryna shot they gon' knock at the back (Backdoor)
My demons anywhere and they clutching the MAC
Plug love me 'cause I flush every sack
Duh dummy, I'm in love with them racks
Wait, who do you think you checkin'?
You rep that lil shit so you think you steppin' (Lil nigga)
We gon' pull up right on you, won't send a message
We go dummy, you lil nigga that's a blessing
Nigga bigger, been quiet since a adolescent
Smoking on dope got me out of breath (Gas)
Whippin' up dope, feeling like a chef (Whip)
Switch up my wrist, hit it with the left
Sagging hard and I paid a lot for this belt
Love the bag, I ball hard, I don't need a ref
In the spot with Big Kream, I ain't talking meth
You talking 'bout beef with me then you talking death
And we play for keep, boy ain't nothing fair
Still in the streets, beat the pack 'til nothing left
Still in the Creek but these rappers won't come there
Gorilla that tripping and gripping
A young nigga rock out with drums there

[Chorus: LilCJ Kasino]
Pull up to my trap, you knock at the back door
We super stocked, we got whatever you ask for
Nike drawers lil nigga, I gotta tax though
Flip the packs, start pulling racks out my asshole
Lil boy don't get shot in the face tryna act bold
Don't need me no liquor, that's what they made Act for
Come through that bitch dripping, he like, "Where his neck go?"
You losing, I'm booling but cooling with Maxo
This that Texas shit, that real reckless shit
Pull up, go to stretchin' shit, bullets start fetching shit
Ain't no checking shit (No way), please don't test this shit
You know them ape niggas deadly
Might send you to heaven the way we be blessing shit
