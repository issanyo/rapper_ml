[Pre-Chorus: UnoTheActivist]
Check it out
Yeah, ooh, check it out
Yeah, ice, check it out
Huh, check it out
Yeah, ooh, check in, check it out

[Chorus: UnoTheActivist]
[?], lotta ice
Lay it down, red beam
Count cash, sipping lean
Wrist same color as Yao Ming
A1, real fast
I'ma give it to a nigga in half
Smoking on dope, big gas
Go and buy a bag, check it out

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Two beams, QPs
Sip lean, kickstand
Thirty shots, two Glocks
Two beams, hit man
A.I., Kobe
Kyrie, chop work
Cut [?], sell xans
Ten bands, pop percs
Work a lil bitch like a Bowflex
No more Wok gotta sip Tech
Shoot a nigga down like VTech
Turn a white tee to a V-Neck
Dracos, pesos, still serve different packs in the vacos
Maxo, Maxo, still make a lil bitch pay her tax hoe

[Pre-Chorus: UnoTheActivist]
Yeah, ooh, check it out
Yeah, ice, check it out
Huh, check it out
Yeah, ooh, check in, check it out

[Chorus: UnoTheActivist]
[?], lotta ice
Lay it down, red beam
Count cash, sipping lean
Wrist same color as Yao Ming
A1, real fast
I'ma give it to a nigga in half
Smoking on dope, big gas
Go and buy a bag, check it out

[Verse 2: Young Lito]
Rolex, two tone
Mad hoes, two phones
Gold on, white stones
That's trap money nigga no loans
Ice cream, no cones
But the drop is vanilla
I was down like a cellar
Now I fly no propellers
I touch cash like a teller
All the bad bitches sweat us
But these broke niggas jealous
So we club with Berettas
Case opps try to wet us
They gonna get a shot
Came to [?] nigga get a lot
They getting mad, I'm just getting guap

[Pre-Chorus: UnoTheActivist]
Yeah, ooh, check it out
Yeah, ice, check it out
Huh, check it out
Yeah, ooh, check in, check it out

[Chorus: UnoTheActivist]
[?], lotta ice
Lay it down, red beam
Count cash, sipping lean
Wrist same color as Yao Ming
A1, real fast
I'ma give it to a nigga in half
Smoking on dope, big gas
Go and buy a bag, check it out
