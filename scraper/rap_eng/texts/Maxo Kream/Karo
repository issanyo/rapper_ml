[Hook: Maxo Kream]
Me and Ike we be finnessing on the plug (That what we do)

Seventy-five a line my nigga this that mud (Oh that's that oil)

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Here's a jugg story 'bout fo' trap brothers
Daddy in the Feds broke as hell stay with they mother
Till the older brother came in with fo' pints (FINESSE)
Bounce em' back to 6 and it changed they whole life (Okay)
So he the second oldest he looked up to Janky Jew
Watch the karo and finesses so he did the same too (Okay)
Show them how to hit them pints
Tote them pipes, shoot them dice (Ahuh)
Then one day he served a random trapper twice his name was Ike

[Hook]
And him and Ike they start finessing on the plug (That what we do)
Money do he jugging packs he run it up (That what he do)
Seventy-five a line my nigga this that mud (Now that's that act)
Remixing with the karo I can't show no love (Don't get that back)

[Verse 2]
Maxo brother charged with murder now the whole hood looking
All the pistols Maxo see was serving they was trying to murk him
Had to stop slanging out the house
Pull up curve serve his gwap
And junkies in the trap he got the nosey neighbors nervous
Shake on the Connery, rock in the pot
Block got hot so his mama kick him out
Plug and dough help him set up shop
And it was a stain on a drink-strong diet
Good to re-up on bars and act
Fucking up the sack couldn't grab no packs
Maxo branched out, started coppin himself
Serve like the money do everything else

[Hook]
So him and Ike they kept finessing on the plug (That what we do)
Money do he jugging packs and run it up (That what he do)
Seventy-five a line my nigga this that mud (Now that's that act)
Remxing with the karo I can't show no love (Aww)
(Trap)

[Verse 3]
On the South was busting tools
Maxo pistol play with her
Ike attended TSU
Started trapping in 3rd ward
In the classroom Ike would slang
Maxo jugging on the yard
Maxo hot he dodging laws
Campus police canine dogs
See Maxo was a nuisance serving students by the bleachers (Who didn't?)
Had no school so cops would still supply the couple teachers (Supply the couple teachers)
Posted by the dorm selling athletes doobie roaches
In traffic after practice flip a package to the coaches (Ahuh)
Harvest season come around and all the plugs they wanna tax
He brought Jimmy he brought Theo and that goofy plug named Matt
Steady blowing up his jack (Ahuh)
Begging crying for a bag (Ahuh)
But him and Ike they split the packs
Whole things even quarter sacks (Deon nigga)
I'm a hog I'm the socket fuck the plug
Got karo gallons just remixing codeine in my tub mane (In the bath)

[Hook]
Cause me and Ike we be finessing on the plug (That what we do)
