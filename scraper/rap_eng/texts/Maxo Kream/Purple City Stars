[Hook: Maxo Kream]
(Yeah, Maxo Kream nigga. Purple City Stars, know what I'm saying?)
I been their, I seen that, I done that
When it come down to that money, I need that, I want that
I been there, I seen that, I done that
When it come down to that money, I need that, I want that
I see a bad bitch, I'ma need that, I'ma want that
I'm tryna' get high, where my weed at, where my blunt at
I been there, I seen that, I done that
We Purple City Stars, where my lean at, double cup that

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Mama through the city with a bitch her too, she black cause it [?] like [?]
Had the 732 like Jeezy's crew
In the land of the screw I'm sipping on screw
Looking for a fast nut so the bitch let me screw
Drop a four in the Gatorade and Mountain Dew
Get the codeine cool cup after school
My faygo friends [?]
[?] nigga fuck your clique
Hog lane switch lane
Kream gang we bang Forum Park
Spice Lane nigga pop them clips
Just ride with the connect I'm not buying
Wet up the block like broken hydrants
Got 223. bullets flying
50. Cal hit you, you dying
Better stay on your grind leave out the bullshit
Got thirty in the nine lit up the full clip
Hollow tips in your face make you look foolish
When it come to my bread I go stupid
Because

[Hook: Maxo Kream]
I been there, I seen that, I done that
When it come down to that money, I need that, I want that
I been their, I seen that, I done that
When it come down to that money, I need that, I want that
I see a bad bitch, I'ma need that, I'ma want that
I'm tryna' get high, where my weed at, where my blunt at
I been there, I seen that, I done that
We Purple City Stars, where my lean at, double cup that

[Verse 2: L.E.$]
Alright I've seen it, I did it
You rap it, I live it
I cop it, I kit it
You stop it, forget it
We so gone off that loud when you see me I be quiet
Still leaning with your bitch and I doubt that I was trying
I'm riding, plotting, bunch of hoes be bopping
Bunch of O's we copping, hit the flow I'm popping
Fools thinking that I'm too fly but I'm duck hunting these niggas
You suckas' thinking they kick shit but I'm out punting these niggas
Out-stunting these niggas, see me in and I own it
Old school foreign, see the style and can't clone it
Been the shit and I know it but I stay playing that good
While they playing yo' self out I'm gon' go play with your slut
I'm gon' go pour me a cup, I'm gon' go smoke me some good
I'm gon' flip getting that bread with my hand up on that wood
It's the way that I'ma do it when you see me on the scene
Fucking with my nigga Maxo cause you know he 'bout that Kream

[Hook: Maxo Kream]
I been there, I seen that, I done that

When it come down to that money, I need that, I want that

I'm tryna' get high, where my weed at, where my blunt at
