[Verse 1]
Abortions, baby coffins, pops in my head like Dolphins
Making my Momma nauseous, throws up crip like vomit
Slang to make a profit for sneakers and other garbage
Riding round, brains he blow like Nintendo cartridge
It started in 2001, Cops ran in the house and they all had guns
Lil' niggas in the house screaming "Daddy don't run!"
Loud man said "If you move, you die in front of your son!"
So he ran to the shredder with envelopes in the pillow
The way the cops came in, would've thought my Dad's a killer
Now my Dad's going to prison, Mom's stuck with three little niggas
And she just gave birth to my youngest baby sister
Big Bro' and hers were doing time for a pistol
Used to sell that crystal, baby Momma's name is Crystal
I wish you would've never hit that lick
Could've went to college, could've been the next Michael Vick
But instead he on the block shooting dice and hitting licks
Banging Screw and sipping syrup
Always on that dumb shit
Three weeks after graduation, credit card fraud
Burglary a habitation
Used to sell dope just to pay his probation
Southwest Alief Texas was the location
Product of environment, hood habitation
Got me racing to the corner store
For another box of Swishas
So I can ease my mind, caress my conscience not to shoot the pistols
Fuck the cops with shiny badges, walkie-talkie, loud whistles
Locked us up in cages, we be raging so we called niggas
All this segregation got us changing cause we all different
Make you change your name for fortune fame cause diamonds all glitter
Fuck the whips and chain, you whipped in chain, that's why you call it nigga
But we still kill each other, did we forget or don't remember?
I think we just pretend
Cause nowadays your enemies could be your best of friend
Gotta' keep them at a distance, there's intentions you don't know about
[?] with precision, so I'm rolling out
Sick of niggas bitching, I got ceilings that I'm worried 'bout
Plus I'm still living and I'm cripping, what you know about
Lonestar, Section eight, funerals but first to wait
Stayed in the Full house, no Ashley and Mary Kate
Used to move a ton of weed just so I could buy some Bape
Trynna' get Paid in Full, Money making Mitch and Ace
Gotta' sip the codeine, Actavis I love the taste
Fuck your church believe in God, religion is like love and hate
Them hypocrites don't give a shit cause life is 'bout the money man
Whether you're flipping coke or working in the grocery store
Stacking paper growing wise, the man told me as he spoke
A nigga trynna' take mine, I'm gunning
Nike's on the pavement, I'ma stand for something
Fuck running

[Outro]
This life, everything happens for a reason, or so they say
I just want to know, what's mine
