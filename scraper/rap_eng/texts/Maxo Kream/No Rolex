[Intro: Gyyps]
I'ma turn it up a bit
I got stitches in my mouth and all that shit
It's some, it's some Through the Wire type
It's some, god, I, I'm a little stoned
Take a dose of dope and liquor
Rollin' up with seven figures
Hold up did you get the picture?

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Maxo, Maxo, ayy, look
I run a play like I'm Tom Brady
Say you a mack like McGrady, ayy
Sailin' the cruise, I'm like captain, ayy
Your price is too high 'cause he cappin'
I sold that TV with no controller
Pushing that rock like I'm Hova, ayy
Say you with dracos and carbons
Trade in my rockets like Harden
Work a lil bitch like geez louise
Workin' my wrist, Patek Phillipe
Moving that base like Negro League
Pushin' that Wraith like Need for Speed
Rockin' that Bape camo fatigue
Workin' the rate like creatine
Tryna compete like speed fatigue
Like nigga please, I'm out your league
Maxo Kream a trap-a-holic
Known for balling, Maxo Spalding
Known for selling whatchamacallit
Broke ass niggas can't afford it
I can't even front him forty
Press decline when he be calling
Fuck around and rob lil shawty
My trap house gon' boom regardless

[Chorus: Gyyps]
Take a dose of dope and liquor
Rollin' up with seven figures
Hold up did you get the picture? did you?
I told her quit checking on me
They 'bout to put the Smith & Wesson on me
Take a dose of dope and liquor
Rollin' up with seven figures
Hold up did you get the picture?
I told 'em quit messin' with me
Yeah get up on this level with me

[Verse 2: Key!]
This a piece of cake, ayy, niggas fake, uh
I could tell your fate, ayy, and it ain't great, huh
Nigga play it safe, ayy, stay out the way, ayy
Nigga play it safe, ayy, uh
Hood rich like Rip mane, I'm worth a grip, ayy
Me and my niggas eating, we ain't never left a tip
Can't say the same for you, ayy
Not staying true, hey
I see how you move, hey, you're so aloof
So sike, you're more confused than a dyke, ayy
You act like your ho, huh, you're indecisive
Woah, huh, gotta make a move now, ayy
I hope you get the picture 'fore you hear the lead sound like woo

[Chorus: Gyyps]
Take a dose of dope and liquor
Rollin' up with seven figures
Hold up did you get the picture? did you?
I told her quit checking on me
They 'bout to put the Smith & Wesson on me
Take a dose of dope and liquor
Rollin' up with seven figures
Hold up did you get the picture?
I told 'em quit messin' with me
Yeah get up on this level with me

[Verse 3: Gyyps]
Ain't no Ear Drummer, I'm a real drummer
I made it, Mike WiLL, I'm the real Sremmurd
Go pop a pill for me, 'bout to feel something
I got Doctor Phil on 'em, I'm the real father
I'm 'bout to get the fans on me, oh they really want me
I'm 'bout to hit Pharrell up 'cause ooh I got some options
I been to tropics, I been the topic of conversation
Never stopping, I think I'm dropping another tape then
How I drive the 405 and they just want to hate me
Come and comment on my hair like that shit is wavy (straight up)
That shit La Flame but I had to say it
I'm the youngest in the game, feeling like the greatest
Take a dose of dope and liquor
Rollin' up with seven figures
Hold up did you get the picture? did you?
Got no Ray Bans and no Rolex and raving with no Kodak
You don't go there
Look at my wrist and I'm coming up straight out of nowhere
You might pull up on a kid
I'm in the spot and I'm watching my back
Leave it to beaver to ruin the trap
Get out the piss oven and hop on the track
Lap and a lap and a lap and a lap
Cruisin' that G35 like a Lamb
We gon' need a lot of weed to relax
Put the village and the team on my back, yeah

[Chorus: Gyyps]
Take a dose of dope and liquor
Rollin' up with seven figures
Hold up did you get the picture? did you?
I told her quit checking on me
They 'bout to put the Smith & Wesson on me
Take a dose of dope and liquor
Rollin' up with seven figures
Hold up did you get the picture?
I told 'em quit messin' with me
Yeah get up on this level with me
