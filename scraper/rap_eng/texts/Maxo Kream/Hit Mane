[Hook: Maxo Kream]
(Hit mane!)
Safety broken hollows in the chamber
Ride round with bangers, taking aim and causing danger
(Hit mane!)
Hit my line and set up an arrangement
I'm usually C.O.D. but for right now I'm taking payments
(Hit mane!)
Pull up early scope out destination mane
John Doe's we cremate em', sometimes leave em' in the vacants mane
(Hit mane!)
Shoot whatever tryna get some paper mane
Freddy Kruger, Jason mane, for me it's just a normal day

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
I'm not a doctor, a lawyer or a real estate agent
Reincarnation, Freddy, Jason, leaving John Doe's in the vacants
Every hit receive a payment
Leaving patients on the pavement
No traces, no faces, no indictments, no arrangements
Most my cases come from bitches who mans cheating, they newlyweds
She don't want him shot up, just beat him until he bloody dead
Tell 'em mind my business, fulfil my mission, collect my bread
Slaying niggas solo, no co-defendants, who seen a set
Night vision goggles, infrared
Keep hollows filled with poison lead
I might just hog tie you by the river, throw you off the bridge
Pro-drilling make a killing, don't negotiate my prices
Blood spilling like Al Qaeda, walking crisis, one man ISIS

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
Another day at work, I'm on alert, my celly chirp, new text alert
Some kid was certain he'd give me fifty bands to have his father murked
I took the money gladly, more than happy, cocked the ratty
Sent his info, named was Bradley
Put his addy in my navy
I slid to the destination, crackheads occupying vacants
Spent some hours waiting, I'm impatient, G.P.S. must be mistaken
Hold up, I think that's Bradley daddy six foot seven addict
Out in Cinncinati, heard he raped his family, I'ma let him have it
Hopped out my Rover, to get a lil' closer, slightly approach him
Hand on my holster, started to notice, niggas with toasters
Bullets start floating, one hit my shoulder
Fell to the floor and I fumbled my ratchet
Bradley unfortunate, he picked it up, grabbed it
.22 handgun I had in my pocket
Shot at his noggin
Leaking like faucets
