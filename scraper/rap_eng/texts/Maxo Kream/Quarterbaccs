[Hook]
Moving bowls and selling dope with fifty rounds of [?]
If you ain't getting money nigga what the fuck you trapping for?
Pistol packing capping, steady trapping by the kitchen door
Nigga I don't know you I'ma serve you by the liquor store
Pistol packing capping, steady trapping by the kitchen door
What the play read? I got fiends running back the store
Pistol packing capping, steady trapping by the kitchen door
Nigga I don't know you I'ma serve you by the liquor store
Pistol packing capping, steady trapping by the kitchen door
What the play read? I got fiends running back the store

[Verse 1]
We don't call em' quarter pounds, bitch we call em' quarterbacks
Manning brothers this Roethlisberger get a pound of that
Silencers and Kel-Tecs, sitting in the attic jack
HK's, Uzi switchblades, bungee cords we strapped
Break elbows down to a fraction
If there's profit, do transactions
Niggas flexing, I kidnap em'
Crystal castles, duck tape wrap em'
Made eight racks in the laundromat
To my defense bliss for them quarterbacks
Put to the eagle to your helmet like McNab
I want the cash and the stash, and the gun cocked blast

[Hook]
Everyday I'm contemplating, money making, stacking dough
Posted trapping by the store while sipping drank, inhaling dro'
Moving bowls and selling dope with fifty rounds of [?]
If you ain't getting money nigga what the fuck you trapping for?
Pistol packing capping, steady trapping by the kitchen door
Nigga I don't know you I'ma serve you by the liquor store
Pistol packing capping, steady trapping by the kitchen door
What the play read? I got fiends running back the store
Pistol packing capping, steady trapping by the kitchen door
Nigga I don't know you I'ma serve you by the liquor store
Pistol packing capping, steady trapping by the kitchen door
What the play read? I got fiends running back the store

[Verse 2]
Fiends scramble out the pocket just to come and get a sack
Manning brothers this Roethlisberger get a pound of that
Forked along to overtime
Fuck a pump we running back
[?] twenty eight stack, watch me quarterback
Down, set, hook, run plays all day
Drop back shotgun if you bliss my way
Where the PA fake and the defense scared
Better pass that long, going for the Hail Mary
With the touchdown pass, I never lost
Even with one hand like Randy Moss
If the feds [?] I'ma QB toss
Gotta' keep the [?] I ain't taking no loss

[Hook]
Everyday I'm contemplating, money making, stacking dough
Posted rapping by the store while sipping drank, inhaling dro'
Moving bowls and selling dope with fifty rounds of [?]
If you ain't getting money nigga what the fuck you trapping for?
Pistol packing capping, steady trapping by the kitchen door
Nigga I don't know you I'ma serve you by the liquor store
Pistol packing capping, steady trapping by the kitchen door
What the play read? I got fiends running back the store
Pistol packing capping, steady trapping by the kitchen door
Nigga I don't know you I'ma serve you by the liquor store
Pistol packing capping, steady trapping by the kitchen door
What the play read? I got fiends running back the store
