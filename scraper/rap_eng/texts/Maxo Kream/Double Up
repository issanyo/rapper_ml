[Verse 1]
It's the snapbacker, gun packer, Uzi bullet ratat-tata
Serial killer, I ain't talking 'bout the Apple Jackers
Stomp the yard like the [?], My gun play it [?] Kappa
Pussy nigga, I'ma pop his fucking top, like a snapper
Crackle like the cinnamon in my Jordan 3's
Take a trip, with my crip niggas, call it overseas
Take caution when approaching me
Spraying Raid where roaches be
Not in the kitchen, but on my pelvis where the toaster be
Maxo motherfucking C, the flyest crip you ever see
Rock the sneaks, bust the heat
White girls, Laguna beach, I'ma freak
Rolling, cheef the purple diesel
Flow is sicker than the measles
Nasty like fiends in H, [?] and sharing needles, beetles
Dope rocks in my crack pipe
My white girl swallow nut, nickname Vanilla Ice
Pair of mic's dead stop, kill the beat, head shot
I go [?] for my pebbles, nigga make the bed rock
Bust the damn Glock

[Hook]
Double up (Double up), Yeah you gotta' double up
Double up (Double cup), Yeah you gotta' double up
Double up (Double cup), Yeah you gotta' double up
Double up (Double cup), Yeah you gotta' double up

[Verse 2]
Handicap signs on the beat, I go dumb
Call me Maxo gas station cause I always keep the pump
Play me like a Playstation, I'ma leave a nigga slumped
Make you say the last dance, Uzi bullets make you crump
Double up, Double cup, 'finna roll another blunt
Fuck a slut, in the butt, then I make her suck my nuts
She a cunt, she let me cut, in the cut, rolling doobies up
My eyes red, the weed smoke inhale, call me Lucifer
Inhale smoke from my nose, call me Lucifer
I keep a sick bad bitch, the Vet gon' get used to her
My bars go hard like frozen sneaker candies
Spongebob, go Bikini Bottom, leave her cheeks Sandy
And then we roll another Sweet, we on point, Widow's peak
Call me yadadamean, cause I always keep the sneaks
Double up
