[Hook]
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it

Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it
All a that money we burn it
You want respect you gotta earn it

[Verse 1]
Taught you niggas till I heard the choppas blazing
Through the death inside my furnace quicker
Ammunition tearing in my furniture
Hit em and then she fall backwards
I got a man twisted
Said she freaky for King if I know she gon lick it
I cover that lean and I cover that liquor
I’m on Instagram like what’s up with these niggas
Bustin down their way for a couple a bitches
We do anything for a double trap, aye
Then I go to nigga I had to double back, aye
Two bad bitches gotta huddle up, aye
And if they rush me it’s all black on the play
Duty [?] smoke it can shatter shell cases
Niggas move out like a pimp and a racing
Look in the mirror like I gotta pay
Angie went in right after Rockay

[Hook]
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it
All a that money we burn it
Roll up that fire and burn it
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it
All a that money we burn it
You want respect you gotta earn it
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it
All a that money we burn it
Roll up that fire and burn it
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it
All a that money we burn it
You want respect you gotta earn it

[Verse 2]
Maxo, Maxo
Maxo, Maxo
Break it down, weigh it up
Sit it up, set it off aye
Rollie on my wrist get bust down
Run through the grass like a touchdown
Burn it, burn it
Young nigga keep heat no furnace
Bliss in the trap for the quarterback sack
Fifty in her tit cause she make me rack
I could never pass on those kids backpack
Thirty on the gap boom rat tat tat
Laptop Mac selling Microsoft
A bitch got a gat like Laura Croft
Bulletproof that’s so Young Dolph
Walk cross hip that’s all my cough

[Hook]
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it
All a that money we burn it
Roll up that fire and burn it
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it
All a that money we burn it
You want respect you gotta earn it
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it
All a that money we burn it
Roll up that fire and burn it
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it
All a that money we burn it
You want respect you gotta earn it

[Verse 3]
It’s that Teflon
I don’t want the motherfucking plank if you ain’t got a sale though
Might as well burn it
These niggas running my stop like they ain’t gotta earn it
Uh I don’t get my hands dirty
Take that bitch straight to the crib and I opened her up like a server
My dick she ain’t really deserve it hop in the motherfucking thirty
Ain’t talking unless I’m bodied, lil bitch you better have body
Fuck around gon get left in the lobby
Nigga uh, I pop purps and I pop Xans and Molly
Uh, all these cash I earned it
Nigga fuck you and your momma

[Hook]
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it
All a that money we burn it
Roll up that fire and burn it
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it
All a that money we burn it
You want respect you gotta earn it
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it
All a that money we burn it
Roll up that fire and burn it
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it
All a that money we burn it
You want respect you gotta earn it
