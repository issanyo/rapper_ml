[Intro]
Maxo, Bussdown
Maxo, Bussdown
Set it up, break it down
Wrap it up, wear it up
Bust it down, open up
Vacuum seal

[Chorus]
Trappin' in the vaco, it's a bussdown (that what we do)
Got it in her whole name, she's a bussdown (she a)
We don't even serve here, we just bust down (uh uh)
Got my shooters on the roof, don't make them bussdown (doot, doot, doot)
Trap out the bag, that's a bussdown
Run through the grass like a touchdown
Plain Jane with it, no bussdown
Try and take my chain, I'ma bussdown
Bussdown (set it up), bussdown (break it down)
Bussdown (wrap it up), bussdown (wear it up)
Thirty rounds (bust it down), fifty rounds (open up)
Hundred rounds (vacuum seal), gun 'em down

[Verse 1]
Stay ten toes, I'm down (ten toes)
Jenny Craig with them pounds (get 'em off)
Diamonds dance like Chris Brown (Chris Breezy)
Look at my water, don't drown (Fiji)
Neck wet like baptized (church)
MJ with the 4-5 (fadeaway)
Trap house strapped, no bugee (say what?)
Wrappin' up a pack like a mummy (uh huh)
Two for the [?], serve junkies (trap)
Serve purp' fake to a dummy (rookie)
Got a lot of young crash dummies (uh huh)
[?] rap with your tummy
Trap out the vaco apartment
I move the dope in abundance (bussdown)
Bussdown the quarters and onions
I split the pot like circumference

[Chorus]
Trappin' in the vaco, it's a bussdown (that what we do)
Got it in her whole name, she's a bussdown (she a)
We don't even serve here, we just bussdown (uh uh)
Got my shooters on the roof, don't make them bussdown (doot, doot, doot)
Trap out the bag, that's a bussdown
Run through the grass like a touchdown
Plain Jane with it, no bussdown
Try and take my chain, I'ma bussdown
Bussdown (set it up), bussdown (break it down)
Bussdown (wrap it up), bussdown  (wear it up)
Thirty rounds (bust it down), fifty rounds (open up)
Hundred rounds (vacuum seal), gun 'em down

[Verse 2]
[?]
Trust my decoratin' (what else?)
Joysticks like PlayStation, sellin' gas like station (unleaded)
Can't keep my clients waitin' (woah), my patients impatient (wo-woah)
Karo marinated (remix), pounds in the basement ([?])
Chickens in the den, pigeons in the kitchen
Quarter birds in hand, clip holds three times ten
Hurricane chopper ay bay bay (ay bay bay), guns got weaves like Shanaynay
Servin' them clucks, no rooster (ay), throwin' them 'bows like Luda' (woah)
Chop Backwoods like timber (ay), I mow the grass like a gardener (uh huh)
I pass the gas like I farted (excuse me), handicap Crippin' retarded (retarded)
My shooter he dumb, he retarded (Cuh-rip), cold with the tommy like Martin (uh huh)
Break it down, pick  it up
Set it up, bring it back

[Chorus]
Trappin' in the vaco it's a bussdown (that what we do)
Got it in her whole name, she's a bussdown (she a)
We don't even serve here, we just bust down (uh uh)
Got my shooters on the roof, don't make them bussdown (doot, doot, doot)
Trap out the bag, that's a bussdown
Run through the grass like a touchdown
Plain Jane with it, no bussdown
Try and take my chain, I'ma bussdown
Bussdown (set it up), bussdown (break it down)
Bussdown (wrap it up), bussdown  (wear it up)
Thirty rounds (bust it down), fifty rounds (open up)
Hundred rounds (vacuum seal), gun 'em down
