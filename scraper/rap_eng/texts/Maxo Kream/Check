(Verse 2)
Fuck up a check like Adidas and Yeezy
Water my neck like Ozarka and Fiji
My diamonds be blindin' like Ray Charles and Stevie
My diamonds be dancin' like Usher, Chris Breezy
Take my chain off, let my body defrost
Cuz my diamonds are colder, I'm sick like pneumonia
Maxo with Boston, that codeine for cough
Pour the drank in the soda, that kush be my odor
I take his ice with the stick, call it hockey
I flip a check like it's Newport or Nike
Droppin' on water like ice in the freezer
Diamonds go cool like Vegeta and Frieza
Banana clips and Bape
I'm Gucci on new snakes
Supreme my mariquana
My clothes in smoke persona, ayy

(Chorus)

Blew the whole bag on my neck
