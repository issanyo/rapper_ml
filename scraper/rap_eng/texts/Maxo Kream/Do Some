[Chorus: ManMan Savage]
Slip up on the pill, with the dooce dooce
Balmain on my shoes, I might have to shoot
Watch the way I move, I might have to do some
I just did a show, and yeah, I made it cool
Ten on your head, make a nigga do some
That's your bitch, with another bitch, that's a threesome
I ain't tryna hit, a nigga do some
I ain't with the chit chat, I just do some

[Verse 1: ManMan Savage]
Slat in the club, with that glocc on me
Niggas watchin, got that pocket rocket on me
Money talkin, my plug got it on me
I dare a pussy nigga try to gang up on me
Gucci shirt, with the Gucci socks
I got 9s bussin for money on me
Simple shot, pussy nigga sprayin on me
Everybody in the rap game tryna clone me
Dope in the attic, poured up a lot of statis
Real drug addict, I get money automatic
Pockets real lardge, with a whole lotta salad
Put a whole lotta guns and money in the mattris

[Chorus: ManMan Savage]
Slip up on the pill, with the dooce dooce
Balmain on my shoes, I might have to shoot
Watch the way I move, I might have to do some
I just did a show, and yeah, I made it cool
Ten on your head, make a nigga do some
That's your bitch, with another bitch, that's a threesome
I ain't tryna hit, a nigga do some
I ain't with the chit chat, I just do some

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
You might see me in the streets, nigga, you don't know me
I got pianos on the floor, I got them low keys
4 G Auto on the road, nan, I'm blowin OD
Cookie got me smokin, do it for the OG
D Rock out with Jo-D, that's when I rock my Jordans
I tell her, take that Codeine, baby, ball like Joe did
If you scared, go to chearch, them niggas holy
AP, fuck a Rolli, smokin Cronic OG
Some ugley boys so homley, but our prices high like nosebleeds
Rock Raf Simans and 40s
Like, fuck a couple drollies
I got love for Dum-B, he made the shell that was crumblin
This time it hit yo tummy, pop you and yo mama

[Chorus: ManMan Savage]
Slip up on the pill, with the dooce dooce
Balmain on my shoes, I might have to shoot
Watch the way I move, I might have to do some
I just did a show, and yeah, I made it cool
Ten on your head, make a nigga do some
That's your bitch, with another bitch, that's a threesome
I ain't tryna hit, a nigga do some
I ain't with the chit chat, I just do some
