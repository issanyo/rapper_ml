[Hook: Thouxanbanfauni]
Hot Wheels and I got 'em spinnin' through the traffic
Pistol, Taliband, and this wrapped in fabric
Still grippin' on them Tec's, grippin' on gadgets
Mind still goin' crazy, goin' ravage
Tryna break back ass shit, bad habits
Tryna bust this bad bitch, tryna bust this actress
No bankroll just gotta big mattress
Big stick tucked under a nigga mattress

[Verse 1: Thouxanbanfauni]
Goin' through it but I ain't even need to tell you
I show you, niggas talk a lot but they can't show you
I show proof, and these niggas think that they bulletproof
But I'm pretty sure the hollow tips goin' through you
Out the roof, and I had to swerve 'em, vroom in the coupe
These hoes think they comin' through just to get schooled
Nosy bitch, I know that these hoes tryna get to school
Got some fast niggas talkin' like they Akademiks too
No no, vroomin through the vroom, vroomin through the road
Vroomin through the lane and your drive way, through your hoe
Goin' through it, yeah just swervin through life hoe
Rap hoe or a lil pole gettin' hella dough
I don't got no time for these niggas and these stupid hoes
Whole 'lotta misfortunes, lotta those
Take a L, then I make a win, yeah twice as that
Twice as much when that nigga fall then he come back
Ion got no time for a nigga who ain't got my back
I ain't got no time for a bitch who ain't got my back
Nigga make a fuckin home run, hit it wit the bat
Know a nigga always mad, can clean comeback
Whole lotta guap and them bands, and a bunch of stacks
Whole lotta thots, and them bitches, and them fuckin racks
Whole lotta bitches who gon' score on me, satisfact'
I ain't got no time for these niggas to talk bullshit, not facts

[Hook: Thouxanbanfauni]
Hot Wheels and I got 'em spinnin' through the traffic

Still grippin' on them Tec's, grippin' on gadgets
Mind still goin' crazy, goin' ravage
Tryna break back ass shit, bad habits
Tryna bust this bad bitch, tryna bust this actress
No bankroll just gotta big mattress
Big stick tucked under a nigga mattress

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
Drillin shit, gotta .30 stick in my mattress
Trappin shit, I can send a brick 'cross the atlas
Stripper bitch, but her booty flat she need a ass lift
Brad Pit, she a white hoe but she a catfish
I smoke that OG catpiss
Naked wrist, gymnastics
Maxo OG captain go ask about my status
Sell rock we love this cabbage
Weigh it up and bag it
Banana clips on ratchets
Strap like Go go gadget
.30 clip on the dirty wop, that's a heater
Bigger than Batista, Vegeta and Frieza
Shoulder strap, snap the cap back, like teaser
Swiper no swipin treat his house like a Visa

Tryna bust this bad bitch, tryna bust this actress
No bankroll just gotta big mattress
Big stick tucked under a nigga mattress

[Verse 3: Thouxanbanfauni]
Bankroll big bankroll in plastic
Bands baby, big bands wrapped in elastic
This shit everlasting but we not lastin'
Me and her fuck wit each other but we not lastin'
Tryna break back ass shit, bad habits
Tryna bust this bad bitch, tryna bust this actress
No bankroll just gotta big mattress
Big stick tucked under a nigga mattress
