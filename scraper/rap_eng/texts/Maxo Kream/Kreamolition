[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Kream Click Gang, we killing shit
Sneaker heads that need Ritalin
I spit cocaine and angel dust
Call me Planters [?] go nuts
Pistachio swag, your bitch on my nuts
Like a Halloween movie, I'ma dig in her guts
Then my niggas ran a train
Kick the bitch out, made her ass catch the bus
Smoking on that cannibus'
Glock on my hip like "Can I bust?"
Hoover Crip, Los Angeles
But I'm from Southwest Houston cuz'
Nigga act foul then the referee jack
Got stripes like a ref' so I'ma shoot the Tec
Remember [?] crew got necks [?]
With a long ass scope aiming at your crews necks
Twenty-four-seven beast, no hibernation
I can't be beat, so I beat the beat, masturbation (Masturbation)
Becky sucks dick and her race Caucasian
I'm a South nigga so my cock tastes Cajun
Ran from the law, sold weed caught cases
Steel in your mouth and I ain't talking 'bout braces
John Q a nigga, let the bullets play with your heart
Put your brains on the curb, leave a nigga street smart

[Verse 2: Lyndo Cartel]
Kream Gang, we take aim and reload
I'm in beast mode
Ring your doorbell, shoot your peephole
And we got weapons like Grand Theft Auto cheat codes
Tote so much fire, fuck around and have a heat stroke
Pay your ransom note or you can get ya' life repo'd
And I don't read music but I recognize a C-Note
Just bought a Tec and four niggas looking like a free-throw
'Bout to get shot with the bulldog, D. Rose
I grab that nine millimeter Ruger and get to gr52ving
'Bout to clean one of you pussies out
My gun do shit
Let chopper put holes in you
Make niggas look translucent
Bringing pain with the gun like a fucking tattooist
Yeah, all my niggas shooters
They won't miss you with that thing
On point with the heat
Six shooter, LeBron James
Kream my Clicc (Crip!) my gang
What up Blood, what up cuz' what up gangsta (Crip!)
Bathing Ape, orangutan
Banana clip from that chopper bang

[Verse 3: Leroy DaCuntryBoi]
I've been the Bathing Ape orangutan
Ever since the jungle gym
Forty Glock on my hip
Got me walking with a limp (Kream Gang)
Heavy metal, hunnid' bombs
Bringing heat, like LeBron
Switch it up, now I'm dumping
Got this shotty and I'm dumping
Leg got em' jumping, like they krumping
Blow a nigga face off, plastic surgeon
Hurting, versing, nigga I [?] now he [?]
She blow me, I blow sweet
Higher learning, back to the murder
Fires turning, tires skrrrting
Fly young killa' mane', do it for the Kream
You rocking cement shoes, I'm rocking some mint 3s
Now how my slut taste? She nut all over your face
Cunt face, leave you in the puddle boy, we don't play
Scratch that, Simon says do what my gun say
And you don't listen then you dealing with my gun play
I'm a quick strike, you a [?]
[?] melting like an ice cream sundae
And the day be Monday
Nigga do a done day, nigga
Put you in a casket and beat the case
Bandana face, don't need the [?]
Niggas Kream Gang, they in your day
Banana clips, gorillas washed up
I'm a Bathing Ape (Kream Gang!)
