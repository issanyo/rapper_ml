[Intro: IDK]
Yeah, yeah, uh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh
BLWYRMND
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: IDK & Maxo Kream]
The moral of the story, never trust no snake (Yeah)
The moral of the story, cop the crib before the Wraith (Right)
The moral of the story, ain’t nobody ever safe (Safe)
She see I got the bag so she put it in my face
Pussy, pussy poppin', make me wanna cop it
Chop the top and drop it, make 'em wanna top me
Pussy, pussy poppin', suck it, slurp me sloppy
All these bitches boppin', Jordan Forces coppin'

[Verse 1: IDK]
Ayy, cash in my pants, now I look like MC Hammer (Yuh)
Bag after bag on my back, look like I'm Santa (Right)
She said she wanna fuck because she like my PG grammar (Grammar)
Get a ho, pin her up, knock her down like a hammer (Woo)
Make her disappear, it ain't my fault, yeah, bitch, I'm mystical
I don't shed no tear, I take a loss and I'm like "Okay, cool" (Right, right, right)
Pretty pussy pink and it's fat, it look like Majin Buu (Woo)
Opposite of Usher and Alicia, bitch, you not my boo (My boo)
You don't get no time or no attention 'less you fuck the crew
My dick like a ruler, teach a lesson, take your ass to school
Crossin' out my exes after exits, bitch, I ain't no fool, true

[Chorus: IDK & Maxo Kream]
The moral of the story, never trust no snake (Yeah)
The moral of the story, cop the crib before the Wraith (Right)
The moral of the story, ain’t nobody ever safe (Safe)
She see I got the bag so she put it in my face
Pussy, pussy poppin', make me wanna cop it
Chop the top and drop it, make 'em wanna top me
Pussy, pussy poppin', suck it, slurp me sloppy
All these bitches boppin', Jordan Forces coppin'

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
Water neck like a faucet (Yeah, ayy)
Louis Supreme endorsement
Somersault, bitch I toss her (Ayy, yeah)
Diamonds, they cha-cha, salsa
Pimp on a ho, come boss up
Windows down, bust the top up
We don’t drive by, we pop up
Fill yo' ass up with hot stuff (Hey, get it)
Hopping out racks on racks
Sold fake lean but he thought it was Act' (Finesse)
I hit the bitch from the back
She give me brain while she rock my chain (Suck that dick up)
V-12 do the whole dash
Cop me a sprinter, grippin' on wood grain (Damn)
Neck and wrist from Jimmy (Who?)
But my grill Johnny Deng (Dang, wow)
We caught a opp nigga lackin' on Highway 6
He ain’t see us creeping up, he chillin' with his bitch
Walked a nigga down, hit his ass with the stick (Boom, boom, boom)
The moral of the story, Trigga Maxo with the shits
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, Maxo, Maxo)

[Chorus: IDK & Maxo Kream]
The moral of the story, never trust no snake (Yeah)
The moral of the story, cop the crib before the Wraith (Right)
The moral of the story, ain’t nobody ever safe (Safe)
She see I got the bag so she put it in my face
Pussy, pussy poppin', make me wanna cop it
Chop the top and drop it, make 'em wanna top me
Pussy, pussy poppin', suck it, slurp me sloppy
All these bitches boppin', Jordan Forces coppin'
