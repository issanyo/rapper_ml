[Verse 1]
AR-57 100 magazine clip
Chopper write a article put you on the news quick
I ain't gotta say shit
My lil nigga gon' hit thirteen
And he just got down with the crips
Loose lips sink ships
Families get killed with the 223
Like Lebron and Mike
Extendo clips with them hollow tips
Make a grown ass man catch pussy like a dyke
If we catch you on the set, then we shooting on sight
Bullet cross your mind like Brian McKnight
If we catch you on the set, then we shooting on sight
Bullet cross your mind like Brian McKnight
If we catch you on the set, then we shooting on sight
Bullet cross your mind like Brian McKnight
My niggas trained to go no fuss no fight
We'll air your ass out, inner tube on a bike
Take a life moving silent like the K at night
Make it rain hop out AK plain sight
Shot em' twice jump back in
Running red lights reunite
Throw away the guns
Kush in my lungs
Taking flights, non-friendly round here
New niggas take heights
Starbucking kill tecs like we bucking on the dice
I ain't saving no life cause it's everybody killer
Eight, Momma called fight for my [?]
On the low, on the hush, don't squeal my nigga
You a suspect, snitch get killed my nigga
With the steel my nigga
I'm for real my nigga
Put you to sleep NyQuil Benadryl my nigga

[Hook]
Say word, we ain't never told no lie
Get your shit pushed to the side
Crew niggas bang third
Keep it cracking on the left side
My niggas don't pop their fives
Some niggas smoking sherm
He ain't never smoked that fry
My gun order come super sized
Real gang till I die
I ain't never told no lie
All my Kream niggas gon' ride
Cause' we, cause' we
Smoking cause' we killing (Real niggas grooving silent)
Smoking, shooting, killing, robbing, (Real niggas grooving silent)
Smoking, shooting, killing, robbing, (Real niggas grooving silent)
Smoking, shooting, killing, robbing, (Real niggas grooving silent)
We can get it cracking
'Bout the action
Pistol packing
Fuck this rapping
Nonverbal
Talk with action
Infrared beam attachment
Niggas funny
I ain't laughing
NASA Houston Rocket blasting
Futuristic while I magic
Put you bastards in a casket

[Verse 2]
Chopper to his neck
Grab the tec
Columbine, V-Tec
Blessed, he was stressed
Vest wet like a coaster
Poser blood on the wall like a poster
Get your man chopped [?]
Hopping out the range
You a stain then this over
Chopper got aim like a range no rover
Pop you on your frame
It's a shame slumped over
Insane in the brain
No room for composure
I don't have affection
Cocked the weapon
Aim projection
Your direction
Blood complexion
From the semi sub compression
Cross connection
In the section sipping on banana [?]
Banana clip on the chopper
[?]
Guns fat, Uncle Phil
[?]
Dope like Homer Springfield
[?]
[?]
Understand we the Taliban
Kream clicc clan
Me and my man smoke 'Ghanistan
Tools like a handy-man
[?] Gun poppin, fire pan
[?] I'm Batman Superman
Chopper sweep a nigga
Glock nine dust pan
[?] hangman [?]
