[Fat Tony]
If you love me, you gon smile
If you hate me, you gon frown
Either way on any day I stay player made
When I roll around throw the roses out
Where's my crown?

I go dumber than Gomer Pyle
I'm never shy like 8 Mile
I only throw in the towel
When my girl gon wipe me down
I ain't stressing, I've been tested
And I've learned a lot of lessons
Seen some partners perish
And some family buried
So I cherish every second
Now, I ain't a reverend but I count my blessings
And if you don't I gotta move on
I'm too strong, getting my groove on
To be derailed by what she tells and what he told
I'm too old and I'm too bold
Getting too throwed
Eating too good like a Sumo, oh no
I ain't gon fall for the bullshit
My mama ain't raise me to be a fool for you, bitch!
Grow up, grow up, grow up, grow up
All I got in this world is my word and my nuts (all I have)
So I gotta keep it too true
I'm in MacGregor Park jammin Screwzoo
Reflecting on everything I done seen
What happens in the dark comes to the light
So I keep it clean

If you love me, you gon smile
If you hate me, you gon frown
Either way on any day I stay player made
When I roll around throw the roses out
Where's my crown?

If you love me you gon smile
If you hate me you gon frown
Either way, I'm shooting K's
Eight Seven Treys
Still roll around with invisible top
Sip drank by the pint
Pop seals, soda pop
Gettin top from a bop
She a flip, laptop
When it come to the cash
I get that a lot
Hit Fat Tony, come down to the S.W.A.T
Bissonnet, Beltway
That's where the crips stay
Posted on the block
Got hoes selling twat
Every minute, every day, money to be made
No butlers
Eleven trey seven, yeah them my brothers
???? ???? ????
Text from my ex
I'ma spread like butter
Fuck so much, I don't use no rubbers
84's poke out like orangoutangs
84 poke a nigga like Facebook
Kream Gang. my niggas let bangers bang
Yeah, my nigga got a sentence, no Facebook
Leave a nigga like a zombie, no Flatbush
Fuck the mama cause I heard she had a fat tush
And I'm gone off the dope, OG Kush
Break it down, codeine in the Backwood
We sippin drank and we smokin
Gone off the dope and it's potent
Dutch Masters, Swishers, and Vegas
And Optimos, we be rollin
We sippin drank and we smokin
Gone off the dank and it's potent
Dutch Masters, Swishers, and Vegas
And Optimos, we be rollin
