Maxo, Tay-K, Maxo, ayy ayy, Maxo, Tay-K, Maxo (fuck 12)

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Mr. Maxo, Waka Flocka, Draco baby chopper
Your gun got a scope?, hoe, my choppa got binoculars
And my choppa might as well be a bitch (she a hoe)
Because it came with extensions and some tits (she got weave)
Choppa with a stock, and some booty and some hips (uh huh)
Choppa hit your block, make a movie, it's a flick
Choppa horny, finger fuck her, she get wet (she a thot)
Choppa blow your head, choppa give you neck (give you top)
Think you bloody? Well choppa leave you cripped
Make a nigga curl up like fried shrimp (shrimp shrimp)
I don't do the race, bitch I do the chase (where you goin' nigga?)
Walk you down, let my choppa kiss your face (mwah mwah)

[Verse 2: Tay K]
Money counter count it up, fffff, beep (gang gang)
I don’t tote no choppa, bitch the choppa tote me (with my gang)
I might just pop ya, watch your talkin' to me
Yoppa have a blood walkin' on the scene
Yoppa have the blood poppin' out yo jeans
Boy you niggas love talking, yoppa's scream
Tote F&N Five-Seven but I'm 16
He think he hard, well that choppa beat his meat (ugh)
My momma insane and my daddy OG
So I’m insane, I don’t know what to think
I’m EBK, I’ll put anything to sleep
I love my choppa and her parents wanna meet
I love my choppa and I think she love me

[Outro]
I love my choppa and I think she love me
I love my choppa and I think she love me
I love my choppa and I think she love me
I love my choppa and I think she love me
I love my choppa and I think she love me
I love my choppa and I think she love me
