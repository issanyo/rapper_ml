[Verse 1: Sir Michael Rocks]
I got six cellphones and still ain't pickin' up for stranger's man
The fear ain't real but I be damned if the danger ain't
Don't walk up on Chuck, disrespecting his home town
He flip on that Detroit switchin', hear it in his voice
I'm Chicago, Illinois, even if I done had a choice
I woulda' still picked the crib that I grew up in
And DK NY designed these king sheets on my bed
You still on Ian Connor's page tryna' pick what to wear, yeah
These peasants fresh as me? Tell me how
They still distressin' t's on they couch
Rock band tees and bands they don't know nothin' 'bout
You heard of Iron Maiden once? Bro that don't even count
Get that goofy out my face before I hit send on that text message
I'm workin', flexin', just makin' music, protecting
Like "what up Chuck, God damn man, it's me and all these dollar bills"
And we make the style that they try to steal
They be runnin' off with it like shootin' drills

[Hook: Chuck Inglish]
Wallaby two tone zones with my fit
Rocking Iceberg like a snowstorm in here
Light work nigga, we won't never lose a step
Watching how we do it then they run off with this shit
Running man, running man, running man, running man
Running man, running man, running man, running man
Running man, running man, running man, running man
Running man, running man, running man, running man

[Verse 2: Chuck Inglish]
Bolt, nine second 100 meter sprint
Four 12's boomin' on Suzuki with them tints
I'm still bangin' Screw movin' slower than a tick
Off the drank, purple rain, and screaming rest in peace to Prince
Back in 1999, the revolution was the time
You get to chirpin' like a bird, it sound like When Them Doves Cry
Why you run off with a lie when you lookin' at the truth?
When you see it in the scope, close an eye before you shoot
Ric Flair off the ropes, Stone Cold, Kevin Owens
With the million dollar man, I don't fuck with Hulk Hogan
Holy guacamole, only know me for the sauce
Ay, I heard you told your shorty take my poster off her wall

[Hook: Chuck Inglish]
Wallaby two tone zones with my fit
Rocking Iceberg like a snowstorm in here
Light work nigga, we won't never lose a step
Watching how we do it then they run off with this shit
Running man, running man, running man, running man
Running man, running man, running man, running man
Running man, running man, running man, running man
Running man, running man, running man, running man

[Verse 3: Maxo Kream]
It's the Bape head band rocker
Pee in corny rapper's jockers
Acting like some boppers tryna' top us
Nigga stop it
Get chalk lined in them Starters
Trappin' daily, place your order
Chuck and Mike, they got them black mags
I ride around with black mags
Niggas tryna' sound like Maxo but they Karo my shit
16 Bred 11's with that thing on my hip
Persona walk, persona talk, wasn't shit you could tell me
Got niggas bitin' up Supreme, throwin' away them Giuseppe's
Air brushed white tee, been did that
Snapbacks, sun visor, been did that
Girbaud slim fit jeans, been did that
Tom and Jerry ass nigga, you a copycat
Runnin' man, you a funny man
Take pics with the gun, not a gunner man
Crash dummy lil boy, you a stunter man
Fake J's, Jumpman do the running man

[Hook: Chuck Inglish]
Wallaby two tone zones with my fit
Rocking Iceberg like a snowstorm in here
Light work nigga, we won't never lose a step
Watching how we do it then they run off with this shit
Running man, running man, running man, running man
Running man, running man, running man, running man
Running man, running man, running man, running man
Running man, running man, running man, running man

[Outro: Chuck Inglish]
Running man, running man, running man, running man
Running man, running man, running man, running man
Running man, running man, running man, running man
Running man, running man, running man, running man
