[Hook]
Young ass niggas mobbing screaming fuck the institution
Hella stupid, rob and shooting
If we meet it's execution
Flipping bitches like gymnastics, she going to let me chop and screw it
Got that work for distributions
Zannys, weed and Whitney Houston

[Verse 1]
We be iPhone 5's like Siri why you faggot niggas Boost-ing
And we pull out the Titanics and you faggot niggas cruising
And we say bye to Titanics hold 2 liter pour a Cruzer
We be catching every fade and shaving domes like Carloz Boozer
Y'all dudes get in flush like the girl's restroom
Can't pause my shine press start, resume
I smoke on dope get high like the moon
I get out dope we tab mushroom
Maxo so cool, Kream Gang them dudes
Respect my crew or end up on the news
We rob for shoot then beef with crews
The police don't know what to do

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Fours tipping like a 40 year old virgin up in Onyx
Gripping grain and blowing chronic
Shooting rocket, astro comet
Catch me dead stocking, sole swapping
Nike Air polished
Leaning niggas like hypotenuse
Trigonometry, I solved it
Don't know how you can't get that shit
Two Glocks on my side with a thirty clip
With the hammer down I'm going to let it rip
Blue flag on the left cause niggas from the Crip
Like a Frito bag your mans get chip
Like a Frito Lay I ain't talking about your chip
Get off that dough nigga brick by brick
Stay strapped with a fanny pack on my hip
And we be under radar with surveillance
Start rapping I whipsering
Transparent, seeing through these sell-outs like a Christmas clearance
