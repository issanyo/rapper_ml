[Intro: Steven Moses]
Ayy, she tryna fuck me for some money
Okay I don't love nobody, got the Glocky at the party
Act retarted, sippin' wokky
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Steven Moses]
Okay, I pulled up sippin' muddy
Dickies red, they lookin' bloody
In the Uber with this bitch she tryna fuck me for some for money
Okay I don't love no thotty, got my Glocky at the party
Sippin’ wokky, act retarded, Guap and Tommy on my body

[Verse 1: Steven Moses]
Okay I pulled up Maserati, not the Dodgy, vision wonky
Camera flashin', paparazzi steal my swag, they tryna copy
She catch this dick ain't no discus
Ain't no disc or drive ain't floppy
Give sloppy, fuckin' give me toppy, molly in my body
Ayy, I been gettin' so stoned, takin' weed naps
Relapsed 'bout a million times, who countin'?
Roll more ounces, roll a J and make a track and then I bounce it
Bitches in the cut get to bouncin'
Ain't about the lil shit, bitch I'm tryna buy eight houses
I was 15 buyin' 8 ounces at the same damn time
Smokin' OG, I'm fried
Told y’all I was done trappin', I lied
Okay, why you shoppin' out at Pacsun, lil bitch?
Goyard where I'm shoppin' now, lil bitch
Tell that ho suck my dick and she do it
I lean off of the wock, I get stupid
Used to have the strap, so damn tough, now it's new shit
Ooh, shut up lil' bitch, you a nuisance
Fuck on a bitch in a hurry
I just hope I ain't nut in that ho
Never ever give a muhfuck 'bout shit but money, drugs and clothes
Now I got money, drugs and clothes
Codeine pourin', put blues up my nose
Ayy, ayy, been had the juice, now I'm just lettin' you know

[Chorus: Steven Moses]
Okay, I pulled up sippin' muddy
Dickies red, they lookin' bloody
In the Uber with this bitch she tryna fuck me for some for money
Okay I don't love no thotty, got my Glocky at the party
Sippin’ wokky, act retarded, Guap and Tommy on my body

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
(Maxo, Maxo, Maxo, okay)
Hey bitch, no Kid Cudi
Purple Fanta, bitches muddy
10-10 murder block, bitch I'm crippin' I'm not bloody
Yellowbone and she slutty
And she wanna suck and fuck me
Tell a bitch to bring her buddy
And just suck me, bitch don't touch me
Lucci collared shirt, no rugby
Diamonds dancin', hit the dougie
You can ride my way like norli
Pull up with choppas like I'm Harley
Smokin' wonton like Jeff Hardy
Cocaine whiter than iCarly
He said trippy, no I'm crippin'
Someone killed the judge, I'm sorry (pow, pow, pow, pah, boom)
Percy, roxy, oxy (what), mary, molly (poppin' them pills)
Sip codeine like it's coffee (what), I'm not coughin'
(Ah, ah, atchoo, I sneezed)
Ayy, backwoods stuffed, no swisher
Ayy, keep three cans like Hitler, ayy
Do it no hands like Matilda, ayy

[Chorus: Steven Moses]
Okay, I pulled up sippin' muddy
Dickies red, they lookin' bloody
In the Uber with this bitch she tryna fuck me for some for money
Okay I don't love no thotty, got my Glocky at the party
Sippin’ wokky, act retarded, Guap and Tommy on my body
