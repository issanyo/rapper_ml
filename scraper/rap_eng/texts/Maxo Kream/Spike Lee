[Hook: Maxo Kream]
Water drippin', ice tea
Do my thing like Spike Lee
Finesse karo, the whole thing
Serve it to a hypebeast
These hoes they worse than dope fiends
Tryna' eat my protein
No sex, I want my dough please
Then she do the whole thing

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Water drippin', faucets
I took his ho, he lost
I only fuck with bosses
Keep K packs in my closet
I'm Tee'd up like I'm golfin'
I'm splashin' like a dolphin
He sideline hatin', talkin'
We put him in a coffin
Water drippin', cool cups
And now he pushin' tulips
Lil' Hotsauce, that's my shooter
And he don't give out two fucks
Them mollies come in handy
She eatin' them like candy
She trippin' off them xannies
Moesha need a Brandy, yeah

[Bridge: Playboi Carti]
Water dripping, ice tea
Ho I just do it, call me Spike Lee
Man she worse than a dope fiend
Dope fiend, tryna take all my protein
Dope fiend, no sex, she want dope lean
She do the whole thing
Water drippin', ice tea

[Verse 2:  Rich The Kid]
Water drippin' on me
I make a movie, HD
You niggas extra goofy
My diamonds kick like Bruce Lee
Hunnid' bands on me right now
She suckin' my dick, bitch don't bite down
Take you off for the fetti
Walk around, pockets heavy
Whip a brick in the telly
I got pies like the deli
Fucking your bitch till she squirt
Young nigga came up out the dirt
Need some lean, call the nurse
Preachin' to em' like the church
Dead fresh like a hearse
Fuck I bought the bitch a purse

[Bridge: Playboi Carti]
Water dripping, ice tea
Ho I just do it, call me Spike Lee
Man she worse than a dope fiend
Dope fiend, tryna take all my protein
Dope fiend, no sex, she want dope lean
She do the whole thing
Water drippin', ice tea

[Verse 3: Maxo Kream]
Water drippin', rain is splashin'
Diamonds dancin', main attraction
Talkin' karats, bunny rabbits
Wetter than a pissy mattress
Hoover gang got bangers crackin'
Cremate niggas, leave em' ashes
Movin', never see the package
Movin', only see transactions
Water drip like fountains
I'm Polo you Lacoste'n
Sip codiene, I'm not coughin'
Got Hi-Tec by the coffin
I'm swimming trunks, you speedos
In water like torpedoes
She wet I got a freak ho
She eat the meat like Cheetos, yeah

[Bridge: Playboi Carti]
Water dripping, ice tea
Ho I just do it, call me Spike Lee
Man she worse than a dope fiend
Dope fiend, tryna take all my protein
Dope fiend, no sex, she want dope lean
She do the whole thing
Water drippin', ice tea

[Hook: Maxo Kream]
Water drippin', ice tea
