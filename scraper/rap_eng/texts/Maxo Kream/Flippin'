[Bridge:]
I Don't Know Why Girl, I'm so excited
Look at my Sprite, look how dirty my Sprite is
Look at my diamonds this house so Enlighted
Slidin' and Slidin' I'm off of them bottles

[Chorus]
Flippin' the packs and I'm gettin' this money
Flippin' the packs and I'm gettin' blue hunnids
She down for the paper, she down for the ride
Lookin for paper, now look at the time

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
My main bitch is Mary my everyday ho
She always gone roll, pass her off to my bros
Make hella profit I sell her for low
Took my virginity nobody know
Young bitch name Molly, she crazy and ratchet
Switchin' my moods go from Trill then to Savage
Spring time and Summer I sell her for cheap
We don't get no sleep, we been rolling for weeks
My slow ho name Xanny be actin' real off
Can't get my dick hard so she suck it on soft
My white bitch is gorgeous, Just came from the border
She come to yo porch won't you pay for the order
Flippin' hoes with drugs, man I go hard
In love with the Lord, call me Maxo The God

[Bridge:]
I Don't Know Why Girl, I'm so excited
Look at my Sprite, look how dirty my Sprite is
Look at my diamonds this house so Enlighted
Slidin' and Slidin' I'm off of them bottles

[Chorus]
Flippin' the packs and I'm gettin' this money
Flippin' the packs and I'm gettin' blue hunnids
She down for the paper, she down for the ride
Lookin for paper, now look at the time
