[Hook: Maxo Kream]
Hand got a splinter I been gripping on the grain
Wide body frame got me hogging both lanes
Paint still wet fuck around and drip a stain
Got the screens falling down on my car like rain
Got the outside black, inside champagne
Catch me swanging down main with ya main getting brain
Spilt my whole damn cup I need a oil change
Blowing mary jane slab line like a train

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Tipping bending corners off the chain I swang and bang
Roxy, oxy, Mary, Molly, hit a stain I swang and bang
Trunk humming, grilling, women, show surround
Sound you know Iâ€™m coming dine
Jack-jumping, blood-stuffing, louse around and hold it down (Mane!)
Swanging running lights (Ahuh), candy cold as pipes (Wha?)
Purple candy Sprite ([?]), Jolly Rancher ice (Ahuh)
Coming down like the wintertime gas price (YA)
Coming down like escalators double cup it twice (Ahuh)
Riding spaceship, like, "What the fuck is gravity?"
Leather wood, looking good, flossing like a cavity
Smoking on a [?] blunt stuffed to capacity
Swanging back to back, it's just me, KC and Anthony

[Hook]
Hand got a splinter I been gripping on the grain
Wide body frame got me hogging both lanes
Paint still wet fuck around and drip a stain
Got the screens falling down on my car like rain
Got the outside black inside champagne
Catch me swinging down main withcha main getting brain
Spilt my whole damn  cup I need a oil change
Blowing mary jane slab line like a train

[Verse 2]
Fresh out the shop paint wet like nail polish (Damn!)
Hoes wanna bop I'm coming down like hydraulics (Already!)
Slapping all foreigns niggas used to ride Impalas (AHH)
Block party by my mama ain't no fucking drama (No!)
808s knocking (Ahuh), eighty-fo's chopping (Okay)
Whole hood rocking, no shooting no robbin
Car flexing like a pull-up, kids eating Kool-Kups
Sipping out the Cruize and [?] think I had too much
Old girl thick and find a yellow bone now (Yellow bone!)
She like the way my six recline she know I'm coming down (Coming!)
Six by nine surround sound, screen by Alpine
Chop, chop and screw I think I'm thinking 'bout R. Kelly 'Bump N' Grind'
