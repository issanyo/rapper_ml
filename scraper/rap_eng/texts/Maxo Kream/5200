[Chorus]
5200 different ways! (Different ways to get paid)
Watch me flex my muscle, movin' weights! (still got other ways)
Acid, tablets, Xanax, Percs and 'caine (ain't the only thang)
4K TV's, iPhones, Xbox games (even wedding rings)
Water, lights and wi-fi for the cheap (and some bootleg cable)
I be ridin' Ubers for the free, ('til the app disable)
Trackers out the rentals, postin' pictures, (sell the whip on Craigslist)
Walk around and bring it to your front do', like Jehovah's Witness
(5200 different ways!)

[Verse 1]
Call me Maxo hustle mane, I move everything
Plays for the triple-double (score), like Abdul Kareem
My first job was in the kitchen (what), I was washin' dishes
Robbin' niggas, juugin' bitches (trap), I made it out the trenches
Nowadays I work my work (uh huh), you should really thank me
Used to take your work and smirk (pow), I was hella janky
My bitch boosted Louie bags, twice a week I sent her
Gotta cut the price in half, because they got the sensors
Switch my mojo, work my move regardless, I sell everythang
Trap like Walmart, don't you try to Target, keep a Super K
Got some youngin's, they be juugin', robbin' Red Box, movie, games
Buy 'em for the 15, and the 30, what I slang 'em man
OG bags, gotta stash the gas in the tank
Fillin' up yo tank... gas, I'm talkin' dank
Oil like Chevrolet.. oil? I'm talkin' drank
Loanin' like the bank (uh huh)

[Chorus]
5200 different ways! (Different ways to get paid)
Watch me flex my muscle, movin' weight! (still got other ways)
Acid, tablets, Xanax, Percs and 'caine (ain't the only thang)
4K TV's, iPhones, Xbox games (even wedding rings)
Water, lights and wifi for the cheap (and some bootleg cable)
I be ridin' Ubers for the free, ('til the app disable)
Trackers out the rentals, postin' pictures, (sell the whip on Craigslist)
Walk around and bring it to your front do', like Jehovah's Witness
(5200 different ways!)

[Verse 2]
Hold today, go like yesterday, different plans, get paid
Grills and chains, [six rings], diamond fangs
Maxo, Johnny Dang, Hurricane
Shermheads call me FEMA, water like Katrina
Sellin' sneakers, Franklins , swipin' Visas
Jordans, Nikes, Adidas (swipe it)
Pakistan bitch, cute, thick, we don't kiss or cuddle
Long hair slick, cut her shit, now I'm sellin' bundles
Sellin' speakers for the whip, 6 by 9's, 4 15's
Got a welfare bitch selling food stamps, EBT
I just sold a curved TV, with no controller (juug)
I just threw a fake event with no promoters (haha)
What you want? A MAC, a Draco, or a Carbon
Back to back trade off Rock,ets like Harden

[Chorus]
5200 different ways! (Different ways to get paid)
Watch me flex my muscle, movin' weight! (still got other ways)
Acid, tablets, Xanax, Percs and caine (ain't the only thang)
4K TV's, iPhones, Xbox games (even wedding rings)
Water, lights and wifi for the cheap (and some bootleg cable)
I be ridin' Ubers for the free, 'til the app disabled
Trackers out the rentals, postin' pictures, sell the whip on Craigslist
Walk around and bring it to your front do', like Jehovah's Witness
