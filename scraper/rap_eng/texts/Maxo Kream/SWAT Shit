[Intro]
Yeah, Kream Clicc Gang, bang
(My nigga I don't know, shit, I don't)
Fuck-ass nigga

[Hook]
And this that straight from the SWAT shit
Like beefing over coke
You could get your soda popped, shit
Loose asshole, never know when I'ma drop shit
Competition constipation, got 'em scared to drop shit
Hogspit, niggas leaving niggas end up Brad Pitt

[Verse 1]
The blunt lit, like Kobe with the sweet I never pass it
Derek Jeter with the bat, man I been robbing
Gold grills in his mouth like a dentist I'ma rob him
Bombed him like Baghdad
Hundred bombs Iraq
Selling weed I Pakistan
When the cops came, Iran
And then preceded to drop more bars than Vicodins
Yeah my Glock plastic but bodies what I'm recycling, nigga

[Hook]
This that straight from the SWAT shit
Like beefing over coke
You could get your soda popped, shit
Loose asshole, never know when I'ma drop shit
Competition constipation, got 'em scared to drop shit
Hogspit, niggas leaving niggas end up Brad Pitt
Hogspit, niggas leaving niggas end up Brad Pitt
Hogspit, niggas leaving niggas end up Brad Pitt
Hogspit, niggas leaving niggas end up Brad Pitt

[Verse 2]
They be sleeping on Young Max
But I'm about to wake 'em
Chains release with the flow
I spit As-salamu alaykum
Painting vivid pictures with the wordplay, no pencil
I'll sharp the lead, erase your fucking head with the pencil
I slice like Kimbo
Kush burning my mental
Getting dumb brain from a basic bitch, that's simple
I'ma make her pussy tremble
Jack it and she sucked the pimple
Virgin [?]
I'ma pop her fucking cherry like a pimple
You rap niggas bitches mane
I squeeze Ks and [?]
Shoot up your funeral
Take a piss on your grave (Your grave)
The Glock cocked, I won't stop
I stop popped in at you niggas like Gumdrops
It's dumb hot
Keep the steel like the welder
Keep the musket like the pilgrims
Seen niggas move weight but didn't touch it like Matilda
Tools, Bob the Builder
Kill your momma and your sister
We can smoke it out the heater
It's paper, bongs or the Swishers

[Hook]
Cause it's that straight from the SWAT shit
Like beefing over coke
You could get your soda popped, shit
Loose asshole, never know when I'ma drop shit
Competition constipation, got 'em scared to drop shit
Hogspit, niggas leaving niggas end up Brad Pitt
Hogspit, niggas leaving niggas end up Brad Pitt
Hogspit, niggas leaving niggas end up Brad Pitt
Hogspit, niggas leaving niggas end up Brad Pitt

[Verse 3]
I'm tragic like spitting acid in children's caskets (Ha ha)
Asthmatic, waiting to exhale like Angela Bassett
Grabbed the ratchet and peel you backwards
It shows like closed-captions
Make your ass crack like a bitch that need chapstick
Put the plastic to your head, like Jermaine [?]
Put two nines to his chest, call a nigga Warren Sapp
Y'all niggas got that reggie flow
Young Max spit crack
Shoot it at your fitted cap
Make your towel snap back (Back, back)
Make your towel snap back (Back, back)
Make your towel snap back
Fucking with the Kream, you ain't gotta ask
Young Max spit crack and I squeeze gats nigga

[Hook]
Cause it's that straight from the SWAT shit
Like beefing over coke
You could get your soda popped, shit
Loose asshole, never know when I'ma drop shit
Competition constipation, got 'em scared to drop shit
