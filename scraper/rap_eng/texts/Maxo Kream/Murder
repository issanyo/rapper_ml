Free the homie J-Loc, they got him a murder
Free my cousin one time, they got him on a murder
Free my lil bro, tryna get him on a murder
Lil Blue got 70 years for a murder
RIP Three-Two, we lost him to a murder
RIP Papa C, we lost him to a murder
RIP Mun-C, we lost him to a murder
In the SWAT every day there’s a fucking murder

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Bullets jumping out the semi
Shells hit the floor
Catch him on the backstreets and nobody know
Even civilians got to get it, kill every witness
Number one rule: can't hang around snitches
Posted by the park, smoking dope, set chilling
When some niggas pulled up and start set tripping
One of the homies took aim and let the burner flame
By that night, cuz had a new nickname
We left the scene went home and my clothes changed
We all had the same story on the same page
If the cops come, my nigga, I don't know a name
But if the opps come, my pistol it will do the same
We laid low, kept cool for a couple days
But cuz was fucked up, the homie started acting strange
In his brain he had the shooting on replay
Popping six or seven xans just to pass the day

[Interlude: Maxo Kream]
And he told me: "Say cuz I ain't tryna go down
Tell the homies if they catch them, they can never make a sound
Tell my son and baby momma that I love them, hold it down
Stopping by my momma crib then I'm skipping outta town."

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
I was puffing on a swisher
Held my head so I can hear him
Told him sit down, relax
You a stump down nigga down nigga
Anybody got an issue, imma' fucking squeeze the trigger
For your son you must consider looking at the bigger picture
Cracked a couple more swishers, drank a whole thing of liquor
Then I took him to the bridge so he can throw away the pistol
Then we headed to his crib for his mother and his sister
The lost look on his face, the only thing I can remember
Reminiscing about the past growing up in the SWAT
Smoked a couple more blunts, took him to the bus stop
Gave him 400 dollars right before he hopped out
Told him, "One love Crip, loyalty is all we got."

[Interlude: Distorted Sample]

[Bridge: Maxo Kream]
Damn cuz why it had to be you?
I found out last week from the paper and the news
Seen your mother yesterday, she was crying like the blues
I took you to the bus stop, how the Laws catch you?

[Verse 3: Maxo Kream]
(Tried to go see my son like a real man do
My baby mama set me up, my nigga I didn’t have a clue
Said the nigga that I shot, was her lil cousin fool
When I ran outside homicide was pointing twos)
(God damn!)
(Yeah I'm lookin' at 35-state, lost my mind in this bitch, I even caught another case
Some nigga in my tank, tried to get me for my plate, so I cut him in the face four times with a shank)

Cuz you need to slow down talking reckless on the phone
And you gotta keep it cool, don’t let your anger explode
I know its hard right now but you gotta stay strong
We getting money for your bail so you can bring yo' ass home

(Man they took away my bail, and they took away my meal, only let me see the phone cause I was switching out the cell, took away my commissary so the food real stale, plus my skin real pale, this the closest thing to hell mane)

At the very last second call got disconnected
In his voice I felt depression, paranoia, and neglection
Jus' a young wild nigga headed in the wrong direction
Now the streets turnt up and they ain't showing no affection

[Hook: Maxo Kream]
Free the homie J-Loc, they got him a murder
Free my cousin one time, they got him on a murder
Free my lil bro, tryna get him on a murder
Lil Blue got 70 years for a murder
RIP Three-Two, we lost him to a murder
RIP Papa C, we lost him to a murder
RIP Mun-C, we lost him to a murder
In the SWAT every day there’s a fucking murder

[Verse 4: Maxo Kream]
Everybody askin' questions
Everybody feel the tension
Everybody grabbin' weapons
Everybody got protection
Everybody picking sides
A lot of plexin' in my section
Bitches tryna set me up
Niggas shoot in all directions
Hope these niggas war ready, shit about to get hectic
Heard a couple homies snitched
With the judge gave em' confessions
Laws pullin' up to sessions
Bout a murder asking questions
Smoking on this meditation, in my mind I do reflections, beat the stage of depression this a lifelong lesson
Do a murder [serve a body] never worried about conviction
Kill mine, I kill yours, won't be no prevention
Only choice is getting shot or end up in prison

The homie still up in jail meanwhile
Court-appointed lawyer took to catch the trial
As the judge read the verdict we froze
Capital murder my bro death row (death row)
