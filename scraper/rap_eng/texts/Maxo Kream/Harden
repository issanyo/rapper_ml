Bitches boppin on me massaging kissing and hugging

We H Town made with rockets astros and comets (say what? )
Young nigga ball like Harden

What a grown bitch she gorgeous
I just rode your neck with a tortoise
Big backwoods no 40’s
Playin in the grass like a garden
Backwood roaches like orbit
Couple pints inflate like an orbit
