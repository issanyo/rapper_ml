[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Kush be my cologne we smoking
Bongs, papers, swisher's bitch
Flicking ashes on my penny
Foamposites out the closet
Houston Rocket smoking comet
Kush hairs Dennis Rodman
Afghan kush I smoke a lot
Feeling islamic
No seeds hydroponic
Gary Payton Super Sonic
Purple diesel Bubba Master Kush
OG Cali Chronic smoke in my lungs ho
Nine in my lap
Smoking green call it Rondo
I smoke by myself in the morning
So leave me alone and y'all know
We smoke them RAW papers
Fuck zig-zags
Smoking on my way to school
Don't even got my book bag
Pants saggin' got the polo horses
Hanging off my ass walked in class
Bitches looking at me like I'm high as shit
Cigarillo in my ear
Eyes hell of red and shit smell the scent
The teacher asked me what fragrance I got on
I looked back laughed and told her
Kush is my Colonge

[Hook: Maxo Kream]
Fuck Them Justin Bieber's
Nigga I be smoking blunts

Smoe smoke it out the bong

Kream Click Gang

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
Higher than Giraffe Pussy popping on a headstand
I'm a weed head the doctor told me in my Katscan
Smoking chiefing puffing sweets
Like Halloween and trick-or-treat
Gar shavings on the pavement
Twist the dodi up and blaze it
Stomach craving eyes asian
Hat and shirt Bathing Ape'n
Welches grape'n drop a deuce in a Derrick Fisher
Sprite doubled up double cupped
Tucked in the swisher with a bubble butt
I dug her guts now I'm on her sister
Higher than Yao Ming
With a juice flattop boy stop
Facebook a nigga leave his head cropped
Smoke pot, spit sherm, Exo's, and crack rocks
Laptop Mac a bitch
And fuck her on the desktop she suck cock
Smoke weed till she fucking pass out Her ass out
Flicked a doobie the I put the ash out
Ass mouth give me head then I wear that ass out
Blast off then i grab my weed
And now its time to spaz out
