[Hook x2: Maxo (Fredo)]
OG don't smoke no cookie
Been trapping can't be no rookie
Big homie, call me Maxo Tookie
Barbecue, let the AK cook it
(This type of work I move it
Ain't frontin me nigga, I took it
Don't make me call my shooters
Don't think this shit just music)

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
My trap house fuckin’ jumpin’
My trap house fuckin’ boomin’
Wanna be a tough guy, get shot like Nike, just do it
I'm with Maxo and we coolin'
I'm with Chief So and we boolin'
Don't make me grab that 30
Gon' shoot him with my Uzi
Got 4 bitches in a Jacuzzi
Wanna live my life, I knew it
Come to 61st, If ya wanna see a movie
Double-O-7 James Bond, I get to shooting
Here's your chance, you can suck my dick, you took too long, you blew it

[Verse 2: Maxo Cream]
I got more [rank than your big homie]
Keep pocket rockets that [?]
Blow like [Newports or a cig homie]
Don't beef with lil niggas, where yo big homie?
Wrap it, bag it, plastic
Fuck rap on traffic
Rap or die habits, scales in my casket
Taking out fractions, strech drank elastic
Molly, weed, acid, serve it to a stain
Clientele work sold by noon
2-0-10 park I'm a goon
Put Fredo in the cut like a wound
Bitch, when we gon' put you on the news
Lying niggas tryna front, just shoot 'em in the back
Lying niggas say they silk, but they never have act
Fake nigga, fake chain, niggas die
Real nigga, real game, this is not just music
