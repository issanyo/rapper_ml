[Chorus x2]
I can take you to the hood show you them spots
I ain't never met a bitch I couldn't pop
I ain't a rapper I'm a real one from the block
I ain't a rapper I'm a real one from the block

[Verse 1 AD]
I ain't a rapper I'm a real one from the block
Once I come in boy you better not talk to cops
Rolled it up in the pen don't bend the top
Are you gon' run up when you see me? No you not
Never lackin' we be packin' 40 Glocks once I'm on it's hit the dash We swervin headin to the spot
Wait a minute only break on these bitches don't trust them thot's
And if you ain't trying to fuck then you better get the top
Everybody let them tell us say they hot
Who that nigga I ain't heard no record pop
Ain't a trapper you ain't never scraped the pot
West side thuggin nose ring like I'm pop
Hoes ain't nothing we got bitches by the flock
I ain't speak no english only talk the guap
I'm the nigga in the city got a lot
I'm the nigga in the city got a lot

[Chorus]
I can take you to the hood show you them spots
I ain't never met a bitch I couldn't pop
I ain't a rapper I'm a real one from the block
I ain't a rapper I'm a real one from the block

[Verse 2 Maxo Kream]
I'm from south-west Houston Texas better known that's whatsup
I'm not a rapper I'm a trapper dipper dapper with them blocks
Cooking dope and eating noodles out the very same pot
With the dope and [?] lock watch them clickers face drop
What you know bout life without parole?
What you know bout sharing school clothes?
Took my 52 at 13 year's old
With the Glock on me pocket full of stones
When i stole my first car I was nervous
Swangning banging hitting curbs I was swervin'
Pulllin up in all the j's start squirmin
Used to watch my ass with dishwasher detergent
I'm a dairy [?] bastard fill this average heater
Break it out the package sell it to a geekin
I don't need a bitch unless it's for a reason
And rather hitting lick's while she suckin out the semen, Maxo

[Chorus]
I can take you to the hood show you them spots
I ain't never met a bitch I couldn't pop
I ain't a rapper I'm a real one from the block
I ain't a rapper I'm a real one from the block
