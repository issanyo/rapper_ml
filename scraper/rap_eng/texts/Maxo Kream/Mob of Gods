[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Long ass clip, dirty popper extendo
Back in the day, used to rob for Nintendo
Nowadays nigga jack coke, tab, indo
Come right back like Air Force, Timbos
Run up in your house, get low like limbo
Aim for the kill, TEC shootin' through the window
Kream Clicc, A$AP, trill young nigro
Man down with the bullets gettin' throwed in the end zone
Jimmy Craig nigga to your man gainin' weight
Smokin' on bum, rollin' sweet detonate
Move in your block like Section 8
From your bitch I need head like decapitate
Holy majesty, it's catastrophe
And Will.I.Am like the Black Eyes Peas
Sip on this lean, sip on this Tuss
In God I trust, Max God I bust
King of all kings, no time for the peasants
Disrespect my presence, get wrapped like a present
Chopper blast from the past, remember your [?]
I let the 9 serve you, then the chopper sloppy seconds
We up in this bitch like a tampon
Hittin' licks, shootin' niggas with no mask on
We stand up, get your funny ass shot down
Young Gods in this bitch, be more than H-Town, muthafucka

[Hook: Maxo Kream]
Hallelujah, praise the Lord
God of Mobs, Mob of Gods
Hallelujah, praise the Lord
God of Mobs, Mob of Gods

[Bridge: Maxo Kream]
Long ass clip, dirty popper extendo
Back in the day, used to rob for Nintendo
Nowadays nigga jack coke, tab, indo
Come right back like Air Force, Timbo
Run up in your house, get low like limbo
Aim for the kill, TECH shootin' through the window
Kream Clicc, A$AP, trill young nigro
Man down with the bullets gettin' throwed in the end zone

[Verse 2: A$AP Ant]
Used to rob for Nintendo
Now I want that Benzo
Ridin' round with my kinfolks
Blowin' kush out the window
Watch out for the cops, stay low
Middle finger up to po-po
Bounce that ass like a pogo
Ain't fuckin', you gotta go
Shoot a nigga like a free throw
Pussy nigga get depo
Full 8, get Peter rolled
Chains swingin', my shit gold
Big knots, don't fold
Need me, my flow cold
Need a pipe, my shit crack
Baltimore like Iraq
Chit-chat to click-clack
Run up in your mouth shoot blat-at
First 48, ain't comin' back
Woodgrain in my Cadillac
All black with the gat to match
H-Town, A$AP

[Bridge: A$AP Ant]
You already know what it is, nigga
On site for any fuck nigga
Free my nigga Young Shaka, Marino Gang, H-Town, Maxo Kream
What up nigga? God of Mobs, Mob of Gods, let's get it

[Hook: Maxo Kream]
Hallelujah, praise the Lord
God of Mobs, Mob of Gods
Hallelujah, praise the Lord
God of Mobs, Mob of Gods

Aim for the kill, TECH shootin' through the window
