[Verse 1: Cartel Bo]
Bag in your face, can you see it?
You probably ain't got the right knowledge
Me I see it and can't do without it
They make it sound good but they ain't 'bout it
No problems in Houston, them niggas got it
Hear it's best to invest in a pocket rocket
I groove when I move, niggas too sloppy, she fuck with papi
You know me boss, you see at the land level like takin' the top shit
Watch how you come, better adjust your posture
Keep me a nina to knock off your nostrils
Life kind of got a crip cockin', money runnin' all through my body
My feet personally compatible with these Versace
You like them [?], crip I can't rock it, money stop it
Niggas lost they niggas, spinners when I think about it
On Uber, I can't ride around when I'm wasted
Ain't bustin' shit but he is a buster
Genetic coating show signs of a gangster
The AK fuck up your molecular structure
FN a new potential customer, fuck him
Before I back and forth discussion, I bust him
Was shootin' in the ass, face in the puddle
I only aim above the neck and miss nothin'
He ridin' around with a TEC and he tucked it
Shootin' started, got to praying and ducking
Why he playin' with the muscle on muscle
I guess he was lookin' for a blessing, they fucked him
The Houston niggas ain't gon' play with you buddy
We'll shoot at you off a tray full of muddy
I'm crip but movin' on a play by the study
That bullshit you comin' with ain't gon' cut it

[Chorus: Cartel Bo]
Ain't nothin' smoother than a Hoover lil nigga
Ain't nothin' smoother than a Hoover lil nigga
Ain't nothin' smoother than a Hoover lil nigga
Watch your big homie do it lil nigga
Watch your big homie do it lil nigga
Cut the check and get to it lil nigga
Run it up, make a movie lil nigga
Keep the finances fluid lil nigga
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it lil nigga
Ain't nothin' smoother than a Hoover lil nigga
Ain't nothin' smoother than a Hoover lil nigga
Watch your big homie do it lil nigga
Watch your big homie do it lil nigga
Cut the check and get to it lil nigga
Keep the finances fluid lil nigga
Run it up, make a movie lil nigga

[Verse 2: Cartel Bo]
Givin' game, up to you to go get it
Make the frame and keep you out the picture
Goofy ass lil nigga, they tickled
Hit for bands and don't give you a nickel
Have your lil bitch lick me like a 'sicle
Stop it, I bring the bitch out your partners and shock you
What's in your wallet, let's go in your pockets
Pull out a pump that'll flip a Denali
Maybe a Tahoe, thought she was yours but now I see she my ho
I'm sellin' bricks out a truck, that say tacos
I keep me thousands of pounds of gelato
Can't work this K like this twelve year old paco
Cartel, I brought my team like some nachos
Yeah, they look at me like El Chapo
Think about tryin' you better not ho
Don't worry 'bout mine bro
See them digits went up to sky ho
Leave these bitch niggas stuck like a pothole
We trap chickens and waffles like Roscoes
You'll die live on the 'Gram like Capo
You do not want to fuck with these vatos
You know me, 'bout my chips and my chacho
Fill the bank like the lotto with guapo, and our motto

[Chorus: Cartel Bo]
Ain't nothin' smoother than a Hoover lil nigga
Ain't nothin' smoother than a Hoover lil nigga
Ain't nothin' smoother than a Hoover lil nigga
Watch your big homie do it lil nigga
Watch your big homie do it lil nigga
Cut the check and get to it lil nigga
Run it up, make a movie lil nigga
Keep the finances fluid lil nigga
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it lil nigga
Ain't nothin' smoother than a Hoover lil nigga
Ain't nothin' smoother than a Hoover lil nigga
Watch your big homie do it lil nigga
Watch your big homie do it lil nigga
Cut the check and get to it lil nigga
Keep the finances fluid lil nigga
Run it up, make a movie lil nigga

[Verse 3: Maxo Kream]
Fuck all that talking, I do this
Don't need a thirty, got two clips
Groovin' like five hoes and two pimps
My gun for play, I'ma shoot it
Don't take pictures with it, I'm really gon' use it
Robbin' niggas and boosting
Ask about me in Houston
Fight in the club, parking lot we gon' shoot it
Who your big homie? he need to come check in
Draco start kicking like Law off of Tekken
Pimp on a ho and I serve out the Westin
Good off the trap, what the fuck is a backend?
Take it down, no warning
You got a gun, no problems
Rob your shooter, disarm him
Trappin', finessin', let's get it
Turn your snapback to a fitted
Kill your nigga and tell you I did it
I do my time up in prison
Pussy lil nigga, don't play with my crippin'
I ride around with the mop, I do
I do a drill on the opps, yeah
Go home and I switch out my Glocks
Switch my outfit and hop back on the block, uh
Way up, bag, seal up, back door
Maxo, Maxo, Maxo, Maxo

[Chorus: Cartel Bo]
Ain't nothin' smoother than a Hoover lil nigga
Ain't nothin' smoother than a Hoover lil nigga
Ain't nothin' smoother than a Hoover lil nigga
Watch your big homie do it lil nigga
Watch your big homie do it lil nigga
Cut the check and get to it lil nigga
Run it up, make a movie lil nigga
Keep the finances fluid lil nigga
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it lil nigga
Ain't nothin' smoother than a Hoover lil nigga
Ain't nothin' smoother than a Hoover lil nigga
Watch your big homie do it lil nigga
Watch your big homie do it lil nigga
Cut the check and get to it lil nigga
Keep the finances fluid lil nigga
Run it up, make a movie lil nigga
