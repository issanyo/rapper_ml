[Hook]
I used to wake up trappin' nigga real early
At my grandmama crib, bitch I had em birdy
I'm juugin' out the Lexus, sippin' lean straight out the Texas
Maison Martin Margiela high fashion straight flexin'
I'm hoppin' out the Uber with my shooter boy finessin'
My little nigga shoot you take the charge we get arrested
My swagger hard like bigger boss you know my squad the freshest
So relax 'fore I hit your ass up with this Smith and Wesson

[Verse 1]
On the squad go hard Relax nigga
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
Stay strapped up with that gat nigga
Come through bitch in the lac nigga
Cadillac nigga, I'm that nigga
Pull up J $tash with that mac nigga
Click-clack I bang nigga
Shoot you ass if you that nigga
For the gang, go hard we brazy
Hit you from far away, Hail Mary, Tom Brady
Smoking dope purple haze
[?]
I'm smoking on this doja, bitch feeling higher
Bitch I'm serving up that lean, I'm your supplier
Juuging out that fucking brick, bitch you ain't getting flyer
Bitch I got that fucking nina, ride around with fire

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
Wakin' up early, bitch I'm steady servin'
Maxo Kadafi with A Bathing Ape turban
No jelly on my toaster nigga I be maple syrupin'
12 gauge shotty pump I call a big Shirley
Got shooters in the house
Got shooters on the roof, got shooters in the coupe
Got hoovers on the couch
All my hoovers gon shoot, Forum Park hoover deuce
Bathing Ape bulletproof
Bathing Ape on my belt, Bathing Ape on my shoes
And I'm trapping that juice
420 for a four, 240 for a deuce
Maxo Kream and I'm still that nigga
Still fuck young Dolph, still duece five killa
Still YM killer, still happy with trigger
Leave you in the basement coming Maxo big tigger
My niggas known for bumpin', my niggas gunnin'
Get locked up for a murder the same day I'm Bonding
