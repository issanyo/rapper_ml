(It's that, yeah, spark a Sweet, roll that shit)

[Hook: Maxo Kream]
This that LeBron James South Beach flow
Mixed with drank and a whole lot of dro'
Don't know how you can't get that shit
Blue flag on the left 'cause a nigga's still a crip

[Post-Hook: Maxo Kream]
And I rip every track I'ma kill this bitch
So good in fact that I spit bullshit
Michael Jordan do a straight throwback bullets
Kream Clicc Gang bitch we the fucking coolest
Go against my team you so damn foolish
Coming at your neck with them big Uzi's
Talking all that shit nigga come shoot me
Boy I smoke you like my doobie
M.I.A. on South Beach chilling
Fuck chancletas, don't rock linen
Nah fuck that I'ma rock my tennys
Should I bust my J's or rock my Penny shit?
LeBron James number eight South Beach chilling
White, Black, Brazilian, Dominican women
Come to my spot and we South beach chilling
Trampoline bed, Imma southwest flip it

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Ask the bay broads, I'm a south beach killer
Fell in love with a South Beach bitch
Get on her knees suck a South West dick
Get head every time I rock these kicks
Taught myself to never love a hoe
'Cause they all boppers and they want my dough
Can't be fixed 'cause I've never been broke
Maxo a trick, Hi-Tech not the dro'
Fuck hoes in the West way back to the Mo
80 Spice Lane [?]
Don't know how you can't get that shit
Dr. Dre said a bitch is a bitch

[Hook: Maxo Kream]
This that LeBron James South Beach flow
Mixed with drank and a whole lot of dro'
Don't know how you can't get that shit
Blue flag on the left 'cause a niggas still a crip

[Bridge]
And I'm on a plane for the South Beach trip
Don't need no bands for the South Beach trip
Shoestrings untied for the South Beach trip
Like I fell on the floor South Beach I'ma trip

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
Keep my hands wet, baby girl get a grip
Tryna' get some head on the South Beach trip
You ain't giving no head then bitch go ahead
I ain't tryna' be dry on the South Beach trip
Met a white girl on the South Beach trip
Fell in love on the South Beach trip
Tony Montana on the South Beach trip
A lot of white girls on the South Beach trip
On the South Beach, sounding like a pimp
Got some ho's but I put em' on the strip
Now I got a lot of ho's on the beach trip
Young Maxo C I'm a Southwest Crip

[Hook: Maxo Kream]

Money on the table, when the fellas gon' get it
Snapback on so I'm Tomboy fitted

[Verse 4: Young Von]
Nawf Nigga on South Beach, hella' sand all around me
Fucking up my new kicks, hit the hotel and fuck my new bitch
Used to be on that crew shit, no I be on that you shit
Nigga shut the fuck up, you'll be the same way if you hit the South Beach crew bitch
Booking off in them 'Raris, breaking [?] that bag
Big stain on your strip scene, it's your hometown so you mad
Come through in that new shit, that shit you never had
And I'm still a real ass nigga got fucked by a skillet
Got my own shooter nigga Imma brag
Shout out my nigga Maxo, we splashed out on them jet skis
Got a bad bitch riding and she keep yelling out "Von are you tryna' whip me?"
"Yes indeed baby", Miami in the 80's
Shirt still unbuttoned moving weight like a Colombian
I just want it all, this world could be mine
If I could get half of Miami to start snorting lines
Tony made it happen so can I motherfucker
But this time around a nigga won't die motherfucker
(And it's that gang life...)
