[Hook: Xavier Wulf]
I hear these niggas talking shit, that's cool dude
Do what you need to
I pull up backseat in car service
You know I don't need to
What's this his bitch, I got a feeling
She don't need you
I ain't got my boosie fade but baby
I'mma zoom to you
You niggas dusty talking thrash
I brought a broom for you
I let these hoes
Do exactly what they're supposed to
They backstage, every show
Waiting for the crew
Plot twist we dissed them hard
Now they're looking miserable

[Verse 1:  Joey Fatts]
Give them dick, never give bitches my residuals
Big money, shit, you niggas looking minuscule
Don't act funny bitch, you ask around I've been that dude
'Cause, you ain't fucking me unless you fuck the crew
Yeah, if you ain't getting money I can't fuck with you
These niggas, they gon' hate but boy that's nothing new
But see you face to face is when they fuck with you
Ain't no better to pay me they gon' [?]

I'm a nigga smacking that rushy
I got a Jason mask on my face
[?]
Jumping, we do this shit often
(Beep) Feel like it's retarded
We don't do good with that talkin'
Put that fuckboy in a coffin

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
I hear these niggas talking shit but I'm like nigga please (yuh)
Glock 4, extendo, keep extensions less on weed (Shanaynay)
Trap out the vacay [?] everything you need (ay)
Trapping like a vegan I got lettuce bro
Maxo, you a snitch
I can't sell no packs
Hang around a snake before I ever trust a rat
Draco, choppers and handhelds (boom boom)
Work a little bitch like a dumbbell (word)
Trap [?] (hello)
Birdie on my Glock (boom boom)
Hydro hide your shops (what)
Sixty for the [?] (what you need)
Get off your [?]
Check ball, make it take it
Fast break, ankle break
Nigga pump fake like a sixth man
Need more lean like a kickstand
