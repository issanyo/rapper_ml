[Intro]

Blue flag on left side of khakis

[Hook]
Maxo spit like a dragon
I'm laughing at all you faggots
What's cracking
I start attacking
Blue flag on left side of khakis

[Verse 1]
I'm smoking on Green Bay Packers
The coppers tryna' jack us
Them crackers want to see us picking cotton calling them
Master
Like Jesus, Jehovah, [?]
Max god the heavenly father
Don't bother, I smoke the sherm stick
Now watch me walk on water
My niggas take aim and shoot
Your niggas get banged
It's gruesome when bullets moving
Go bang when the [?] shooting
We gr52ving it's five deuce Hoover
Steel in my hand, Freddy Krueger
You losers intruders
My pockets fat like Rasputia
Flow hella' 'tarded
I just farted, bended and shitted on em'
Don't need a toilet
Grab the faucet and put the sprinklers on em'
Constant my cheddar
Def-Jam vendetta, Beretta
Bet you like cheddar for playing with mozzarella when clever fella
Hella' fly I should lend yo' ass a feather
Let god forgive em'
Max god kill em', they burn in hell forever
You dig what I do like shovel
My kush smell like Fruity Pebble
The devil always telling me that I can shoot with the metal
Her booty jiggle like jello
I'm 'bout to feed her my egg role
No college, I make her [?] for dollars
I get brain like scarecrow
For real Maxo, for real though
I'm hungry hungry like hippo
You niggas hating like Jim Crow
You fucking fake like a dildo
I'm fucking face like I'm [?] (He dead, amen)
I'm so notorious
Older rappers is gross to me
Bagging bitches like groceries
Feeling death is approaching me

Spitting cocaine and meth
So y'all niggas is not as dope as me

[Bridge]
Amen, look
Amen, look
Amen, look

[Verse 2]
I'm always boasting and bragging
Buying shit you can't have
And I'm always balling like magic
You falling into a casket
For goodness sake
Give me a break
Is you Ricki Lake or something?
My life is great
Your life is fake
Like you imitating something
I'm always kicking like [?]
Smoking on marijuana
Her pussy hot wet like sauna
I hit her then roll a blunt up
I'm always banging a C
And I keep some Js on my feet
And I'm fucking the industry
Me and my niggas in the street
And the bitches is on my D
And I'm fucking them in the sheets
When I fuck her I make her scream
'Cause I'm the CEO of Kream
And this rap shit right here my dream
Like Jordon got me six rings
But never rocking six [?]
Got Space Jams and no G3s
Maxo Kream
Sneaker King
I'm mixing promethazine
This is Kream as you can see
My nigga this is KCG
