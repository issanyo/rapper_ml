[Intro: PeeWee Longway]
Ooh
Ayy man
They think I'm crazy
Let's be real
This how I feel, nigga
Ayy

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway]
Let's be real, pop a pill
Let's be real, pop a pill
They think I'm crazy, huh
Let's be real, they think I'm crazy
They think I'm crazy, let's be real

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
Get geeked up, let's pop more pills
Whippin' up a brick, pot stainless steel
Chain so Crip, got stains for real
Trappin' on the hill with the Jack and the Jill
Four forty-eight gas bags in the grill
They say I'm crazy, I iced out my grill
VVS pointers, get the box, shot jumpers
Runnin' from 12, throwin' packs in the dumpsters
They think I'm crazy, let's be real
Longway and Maxo, we pressin' the XO's
You can get a K pack for Creflo
Sell a hundred bags on the Metro
Backdoor beatin' like Zesto
VV, my wrist and my neck glow
Got a hand chopper sprayin' like Mayco
I'ma pour a whole pint in a Faygo
I never call my man like Diego
Got a whole half a mil on the layover
When I fuck, you gotta go, you can't stay over
All I want is the money, the payola
Longway, bitch

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway & Maxo Kream]
Let's be real, pop a pill
Let's be real, pop a pill
They think I'm crazy, huh
Let's be real, they think I'm crazy
They think I'm crazy, let's be real
(So don't start shit, uh
Handicap crippin', retarded)

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
Hop on the plane with them hot take bottles
Hit the runway like a motherfuckin' model
Karo a pint and I'ma hit it with the nozzle
Rerock the pint and I'ma put the seal back
Watch me pull a rabbit out the hat
Purple new batch, I'ma act like it's Act'
Huh, trap house workin' out the back
Wholes and halves and we servin' K packs
Whoa, all of my waters is VV's
Maxo and Longway them big C's
Y'all Crip niggas just picked on the yellow
Bring the groove back, call me Maxo Stella
Longway be rollin' like Kelly, hmm
Trey Pound Seven 'bove my belly, hmm
Bust a pack down, it was smelly
Trappin' out the Telly, scene shakin' like jelly, hmm
Say I'm crazy, so don't start it, ayy
Handicap crippin', retarded
Huh, huh, so don't start it
I say I'm handicap crippin', retarded, ayy

[Chorus: PeeWee Longway & Maxo Kream]
Let's be real, pop a pill
Let's be real, pop a pill
They think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, so don't start it
I'm handicap crippin', retarded
Huh, let's be real, (I'm crazy, so don't start shit)
They think I'm crazy (I'm handicap crippin', retarded)
They think I'm crazy (Michael Jackson, sell out the Garden, hey)
Let's be real (I'll pass the gas like I bought it)
Hey, let's be real, pop a pill
Let's be real, pop a pill
They think I'm crazy
