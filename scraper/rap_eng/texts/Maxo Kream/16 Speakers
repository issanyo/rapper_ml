[Chorus]
Gold banging (I'm shining man)
On swangin' (I know you see us man)
Door swangin' (Swangin' man)
Trunks banging
Know you hear us man
Know you hear us man
Trunk banging

[Verse 1: Chuck English]
16 speakers tweaking in my van
Back in 96 i bought the ice cream man
Ain’t ballin in Jace's like candy
Got supreme sitting high they can't stand him
Tanning creme on seats and they Sandy
It makes sense when you see a guy
And damn it I’m in traffic I’m the man do the math
I’m ain't give a nigga happening
I’m trying to cut my dash but they use it as a fan
You got to wipe me down shit I got to take a bath
Dripping lane switching in a slim back rack
I got 25 lighter but can’t find my bag
If you light that shit slow them boys will pour that up
I’m trying to tip four fours and drop on them boys
Candy paint on the doors wood grey on the floor
I’m trying to tip four fours and drop on them boys
Candy paint on the doors wood grey on the floor

[Chorus]
Gold banging (I'm shining man)
On swangin' (I know you see us man)
Door swangin' (Swangin' man)
Trunks banging
Know you hear us man
Know you hear us man
Trunk banging

[Verse 2: Fat Tony]
I’m riding, see the police, pull up right beside them
They ain't tripping, see me smoking, sipping on Long Island
Sherrif say he needs a favor, wanna bum a Vega
Kept the player gave it, told him say hey to mayor
Yeah, yeah, I ain't got no worries anywhere
From the city where the piff is plenty in the air
Not P. Diddy, Big Poppa, or Willy
But I keep it jiggy
Think I’m Iggy Pop when I rock
Cause I gotta go raw diggy
Dig it, baby, if you're with it, you can be my lady
I ball like Tracy McGrady cause I ain’t lazy
I'm all in it, verbatim she say I'm the greatest
All y'all niggas that hated should go straight to Haiti
I’m wavy, I’m gnarly, y'all see me hardly
I La Di Da Di with your daughter at the after party
Ain't on a molly but I’m jolly, jumping like an ollie
She jump up on it
If I want it, might make you a mommy

[Chorus]
Gold banging (I'm shining man)
On swangin' (I know you see us man)
Door swangin' (Swangin' man)
Trunks banging
Know you hear us man
Know you hear us man
Trunk banging

[Verse 3]
84’s tip top cops drop body rock
Me and chuck took double cup double up
Then i swat calk 9 start to work
Mixing fathom with the drinks
Sipping dope Blowing stink
Say she want my ball park Franks
Smoking grammys and he's poping pantys
Bitch gimmie punanny
