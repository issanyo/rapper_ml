84's, watch the candy gloss, call it Randy Moss

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Smoking, sipping, chiefing, loccing'
Cripping, Geeking, leave you leaking
Murk off in the Lincoln watch me navigate
Over trees like avatars, I'm floating like I'm Cassius Clay
'Bout half the day, I'm Hattie May when saving capes keep 401K's like Sally May
Smoke a Sweet of ganja, Donkey Kong with the Bathing Apes
No hesitate, I cock and spray and leave you up in heaven's gate
If satan's saints can dodge complaints Max God confronts them face to face
Deceased them from the human race and twin tower evacuate
My gun start bussing' ejaculate, go to school kill the kids and the faculty
Kreamy Maxo Kream your majesty cause casualties or actually
I leave you on lean like the S.U.C., 'cause my chopper big body like a SUV
I want a fuck nigga to flex on me
I'ma shoot at his ten put his brain on his shirt
'Cause I'm tripping with the semi with my J's on the turf
I break down that Philly' by my dick when she slurp
I'm kissing the purp, she want some water
She sucking and swallow but likely she burp
I'm puffing the purp, like a rootbeer I float
Elevate from the earth smoking rocky shit bro
I'm rockin like G-Shock that shoot through my [?]
I flame you fajita then hasta la vista

[Interlude: Kream Jay]
How the fuck the whole of your squad got bands and three of you niggas trap bro? Fuck ass niggas always talking man. Kream Clicc shit nigga, fuck your whole block up nigga [?] yo' game slipping nigga. (Fuck yo' bitch any day. Ay' Maxo [?] all the fuck niggas [?] what's cracking nigga 10800 Forum Park, shout out Lyndo. If I ain't fucked up yo' set I fucked yo' ho [?] Kream Gang nigga.)

[Hook: Maxo Kream]
84's, watch the candy gloss, call it Randy Moss
84's, watch the candy gloss, call it Randy Moss
84's, watch the candy gloss, call it Randy Moss
84's, watch the candy gloss, call it Randy Moss

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
I be flowing like the carpet or the pavement
Hit the payment like a comet rocket astro, bullets spraying what I'm saying
Super Saiyan lines while slaying dimes like Christmas time
Importing Nines, cool grade pay selling nickel dimes
Slutting bitches local give me focal with the super bad
Sick of niggas roaching going postal with the semi mag
Underground like Harriet Tubman when there's ruckus popping muskets
More kicks than an infant baby in the mother's stomach
No discussion, shoot you out in public, fuck the repercussions
Reaper coming, clip percussion, drama's drumming, shinning like a grilling women
Buy them grills get top from women, zone top like noodles ramen
More gold than Tutankhamen and Dennis Rodman, hard to spot them
Overheads like projections with my lyrical selections
C-section ripping stomachs out with the Smith and Wesson
Viewer discretion is advised as murder will be televised
Slice and dice and summarize the bodies unidentified

[Outro: Kream Jay]
Maxo wake yo' ass up nigga, got a motherfucking lick. Call Lil Black up man. Grab the AR, grab the chopper man, get this money. (Some of these broke niggas ain't got nothing to do. [?] Kream Clicc up next nigga, check the charts nigga check the [?] [?] YouTube. All that sneak dissing get you no money.) Nigga fucking you bitch everyday, shout out Kream [?] nigga, he fucking your main bitch
