[Verse 1]
(Kream Clicc Gang, bang, Retro card nigga,)
Best out, no one's compatible
Kream Gang, we radical
We throwed in the game
Like sweeps and foreign laterals
Popping bitches like adderall
Bathing Ape from the catalogue
Swisha grape, roll up the shake, the size of a log
Sick word play, alot of weapons in my repertoire
Got alot of kicks, so my closet look like martial arts
My nigga we the shit, you other niggas can't pass so far
Doper than the glad bags of raw, bags Goyard
I go hard, Pokemon niggas I am Charizard
Then raptar, [?] going [?]
Expectar, gadget with the ratchet, you won't go far
Unless you're [?] Green chasing a fucking Jaguar

[Pre-Hook]
The cops, we double daring them, comparing us to heroin
Premium goods we wearing them, crashing botiques like terrorists
Jordans with Nike air on them, fly ass niggas we arrogant
The shit we wore in 2008, y'all still wearing it

[Hook]
Yeah, lil' homie we the best out
Skinny jeans, new J's with the tecs out
Stop playing, we the best out
Got your baby momma posing with her chest out
Yeah, lil' nigga we the best out
Skinny jeans, new J's with the tecs out
Stop playing, we the best out
Got your baby momma posing with her chest out

[Verse 2]
You rap niggas is stupider, fuck Mars, we on Jupiter
With Lucifer, I'm high as hell, YSL buckles, nothing new to us
Get used to us, we the best like Khaled
Catch me swagging with my pants sagging
Bolster bragging, splurging cashing
Best out like Kobe, Jordan, or Michael, Bryant
Word to [?] and LeBron [?], I'm a Simba Lion
Since my birth, my destiny was the subject
They wanna' kick me out my destiny like [?] so fuck it
Switched the game up now my swag a lil' different
Now they waiting on my mixtapes like Jordans in December
Remember when y'all use to call us hypebeasts?
Now y'all wanna' rap just like me, command, paste, copy

[Pre-Hook]
The cops, we double daring them, comparing us to heroin
Premium goods we wearing them, crashing botiques like terrorists
Jordans with Nike air on them, fly ass niggas we arrogant
The shit we wore in 2008, y'all still wearing it

[Hook]
Yeah, lil' homie we the best out
Skinny jeans, new J's with the tecs out
Stop playing, we the best out
Got your baby momma posing with her chest out
Yeah, lil' nigga we the best out
Skinny jeans, new J's with the tecs out
Stop playing, we the best out
Got your baby momma posing with her chest out
