Try to rob me get the fully or the semi, tell me what you want?
I got clientele, send it to me, I'mma get it off
Wake up early in the morning just to go and count it
Wake up early in the morning just to go and count it
I got clientele, I got clientele

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
Buss a bag then drop it on the scale
Get a pack next day through the mail
Fuck 12, don't wanna go to jail
Hit the block and the fiends raise hell
Got 30 Act pints in the freezer
Hi-Tech red got it by the liter
IPhone 2 weigh in the beeper
Yeah, my trap stay jumping off the meter
Trap say boomin', yeah that's what he say
If your trap really boomin' take you out like a date
In the spot all day, on the phone making plays
In the kitchen 3 scales 4 stoves no plates
Bring the pack to your house, you ain't even gotta wait
Double bags vacuum sealed, you ain't even gotta weigh it
I front 3 packs yall ain't even gotta pack
Just move real fast have the bread the next day
Cause I got clientele, move it through the mail
The dope it come in bails, double package vacuum sealed
I don't need no scale, keep it wrapped, it's gonna sell
I got the drank as well, orange soda, Kenan & Kel
Fuck the feds and fuck the judge
Fuck the cops they catching slugs
Fuck the laws I'm selling drugs
Fuck a job I'm bussin' jugs
Fuck the feds and fuck the judge
Fuck the cops they catching slugs
Fuck the laws I'm selling drugs
Fuck a job I'm bussin' jugs

[Verse 2: Lamb$]
I got clientele, I got clientele

How much can you sell, how much can you sell?
Money in your pockets I can't even tell
Fuck nigga back up, back up, don't get too close
Hendrix in the cut, he gon' hit you with them hollows
From Texas to Ohio niggas know I'm good
Got my chains on when I'm in your hood
Don't tell me you the plug if you ain't showin' love
Niggas kick your door cause they don't give a fuck
If I die today, give my work to all my niggas
If I die today, give my racks to all my bitches

[Verse 3: Ski Mask Malley]
Hello? hello? Trap with all my rebels
My niggas moving that blow, I got kush, pills and elbows
On that bullshit like D. Rose, I'mma short shots free throw
Your girlfriend a G.O and you saying her you hero, hold up
All of my niggas is ratchet as fuck
Slinging no plates and we slapping him up
Nigga play crazy and I’m clappin' him up and I’m poppin' my trunk when I’m back in the pump
Poppin' them xanny's and servin' that lean
12 hundred licks, squadding up get my team
Ball like a rockie or call me Hakeem
I’m stackin' that green, tall like Yao Ming
I know that you ‘bout all that shit that you talk
Talkin’ that talk but I walkin' that walk
Get hit with the eagle or pop with the hawk
Fuck the beefing all I do is assault
I got clientele, I got clientele
Get it by the bale, sit it on the scale

[Hook: LAMB$]
