[Hook]
New plug on the smoke
Got my youngins sellin' dope (Got my youngins sellin' dope)
New plug on the smoke
Got my youngins' sellin' dope (Got my youngins sellin' dope)
When I wake up brush my teeth
I need a blunt, I hit the sto' (Blunt, I hit the sto')
Grab a box of yellow baggies
And a Swisha 'fo I go (Swisha 'fo I go)
I can't even eat
I need that smoke before my breakfast (Smoke before my breakfast)
I can't even eat
I need that smoke before my breakfast (Smoke before my breakfast)
Standin' on the block and movin' squares like playin' Tetris
New plug on the smoke
I'm sellin' dope in Houston Texas

[Verse 1]
New plug on the smoke, sellin' Pepsi not Coke
I ain't gotta hit the stove, but I gotta hit the sto'
I ain't got the munchies, need that codeine on my tummy
Crawlin' like a toddler, keep a baby bottle like I'm Tommy
This ain't Aunt Jemima, this that Hi-Tech and that ganja
Smokin' on Obama, tie your granny up for a comma
Take your shoes for a dollar
Maxo Kream, what you mean?
I'm 'bout the cheese, If I run up on you bet you I'll squeeze

[Hook]
New plug on the smoke
Got my youngins sellin' dope (Got my youngins sellin' dope)
New plug on the smoke
Got my youngins' sellin' dope (Got my youngins sellin' dope)
When I wake up brush my teeth
I need a blunt, I hit the sto' (Blunt, I hit the sto')
Grab a box of yellow baggies
And a Swisha 'fo I go (Swisha 'fo I go)
I can't even eat
I need that smoke before my breakfast (Smoke before my breakfast)
I can't even eat
I need that smoke before my breakfast (Smoke before my breakfast)
Standin' on the block and movin' squares like playin' Tetris
New plug on the smoke
I'm sellin' dope in Houston Texas

[Verse 2]
Knick-knack paddy whackin'
Frontin' all my niggas, sackin'
Prices doin' jumpin' jacks
Smoke like we got cataracts
Swishers stuffin' woods and backs
Smokers givin' feedback
They say we got the loudest packs
The dankest tracks right next to crack
We under tax, imagine that
Watch my youngins work it, twerk it
On the corner standin' back
Got the block pumpin' jumpin' now the stains ask for wax
All my workers countin' checks, they play it smart, avoid arrests
First day of school they step in fresh

New plug on the smoke

I need that smoke before my breakfast (Smoke before my breakfast)
Standin' on the block and movin' squares like playin' Tetris
New plug on the smoke
I'm sellin' dope in Houston Texas

[Verse 3]
Investin' hella stock in pot, that's what I sell on my block
The cops is hot, like fuck a bank, put stash inside a shoebox
See trapped juggin' off the gun ganja since the shorty doowap
My trap was slow, I wish I had the knowledge that I do now
Fuckin' up my profit even diggin' in my re-up
But now I stack, one day retire later, with my feet up
Benz with foreign features, and leather Italian sneakers
Until that day my youngins hunt the block like Jeepers Creepers
