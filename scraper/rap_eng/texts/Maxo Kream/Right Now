[Intro]
Protege Beatz

[Chorus]
Poppin' a pill (A pill?), real 'bout it
My shooter off meds right now (Off meds?)
Gon' shoot up a party (A party?)
I need them ends right now-right now (Right now?)
Shooter get paid off a body, ayy
Run through that shit, ain't losin' no count
Then count it again 'cause they shot me
Missin' my money, we're problems (Ding ding)
Got forty thou on me now (Now?), musta been sloppy, ayy
I need that cash right now (Right now?)
Gon' fill up a bag right now-right now, ayy (Right now?)
I'll put one in your head right now
Shooter got two in the van right now (Right now?)
Touch me, it's off with your head (Your head?)
Got blood all over this bread (This bread?), I clean it down (It down?)
Still gon' pull up with work (With work?)
Gon' hit me a trap somewhere and mix it down

[Verse 1: Gino Marley]
Doin' this shit for my brothers and bitch I'm a cap (A cap?)
Whether you like or you love it (You like it?)
Style my whores up with buttons (With buttons?)
I pull up with clean (With clean?)
Only serve that to my brother (Clean?)
Servin' that dirty, I'm probably still riskin' my all (My all?)
I can't stay clean for nothin' (For nothin'?)
Pour up my lean in somethin' (In somethin'?)
Pour up my lean, no bubblin' (Lean)
All of this money, that shit comin' right at me dirty (Dirty?)
Residue be on the loot so dough me down (Reisdue?)
Forty floors up to see me now (See me?)
I'm servin' work
Bitch can't get to the top (To the top?)
Just to top me now (To the top?)
Shot up from the bottom
Bitch can't get to the top (The top)
Just to block me now (Yeah)

[Refrain: Gino Marley]
They see them Rolls, wanna top me now, ayy
Work in the spot be down, ayy
Work and then spot me now
Had to clean that spot, had to wipe me down
They see them Rolls, wanna top me now, ayy
Work in the spot be down, ayy
Work and then spot me now
Had to clean that spot, had to wipe me down
They see them Rolls, wanna top me now, ayy
Work in the spot be down, ayy (I trap)
Work and then spot me now
Had to clean that spot, had to wipe me down
(I trap) Rolls, wanna top me now, ayy
Work in the spot be down, ayy (I trap)
Work and then spot me now
Had to clean that spot, had to wipe me down (I trap)

[Chorus]
Poppin' a pill (A pill?), real 'bout it

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
What's the play, Maxo?
Young loc got the four-four in the trunk now
Got blow, got weed, got lean right now
All gold with the team 'bout to take somethin' down
Need a X and the meth or the K and the TEC
Hit your necks to your vest to the knees on down
Ran off with the trees then bounced on the gas
Left his ass on E right now
Trap house lil' women, fiends wipe me down
Three o'clock and I'm servin' dope fiends right now
Fuck the infared beam, bring the green ones out
Suppressor on the thing, won't hear no sound
Kream clique killa, where, when, where the how
You ain't pop shit when your homie got down
Nigga, talk shit, but your homie in the ground
He ain't get killed, but your homie got found
Lean though, I gangbang, slang and I hang with the crips
'Bout to go orangutan, bet it rain with the clips
Earrings, whips, chains, shoes, say like a bitch
Need a bitch that can slang, shoot a bitch in the face
Hit your crib with the K, man down in this bitch
'Bout to take everything, fittin' to hand out shit
And everyone call me Maxo Santa
RIP Fredo, Pauline and The Phantom
