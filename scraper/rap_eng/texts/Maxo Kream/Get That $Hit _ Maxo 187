[Verse 1]
We got toasters in the whip, I got fiends at the door
I be trapping like a bitch, I got workers by the store
They be packing thirty clips, choppa' toting let it blow
Never talk around a bitch, messy ho's will get you smoked
I don't got no fucking friends, just my choppa' and my scope
Heard a nigga got plex well bitch what's cracking let me know
Kidnap your baby momma then we pistol whip that hoe
Do you like Benihana's? You'll get served in front of that hoe
There ain't no game when the Mac go bang
Rob dice game and crack cocaine
Set a nigga up, then go hit the stain
11 Tre 7 that's Kream Clicc Gang

Fuck Mayfield we ain't deuce 5 gang

Whole block wild, I don't never go to sleep
Fuck nigga mad 'cause the bitch chose me
I don't want the slut but she licked my meat
Can't no fuck nigga handle me
10800 Free CVD
Move packs through the air boomerang frisbee
Gone off the molly and the tuss' we wildin'
Ruff with the Tec, eject defiling
He ain't moving bricks, fuck nigga be lying
Ran in his trap, only had three ounces
Left a nigga dead by the duplex houses
You a ho nigga wearing skirts and blouses
Trap off vaco's and 'bandoned houses
Jug all year, I ain't taking no losses
I got bitches in the trap, I got hookers by the store
Call me if you need a slut, you know Maxo jugging ho's
Fuck nigga sneak dissing, they be plotting on the low
Frilly nigga squashing beef, fuck a truce we go to war, nigga
(Pistol in my lap, pistol, pistol in my lap
Pistol in my lap, pistol, pistol in my lap)

Yeah, fuck y'all ass nigga, I ain't buying none of that shit. Don't call me, don't hit me tryna' squash shit nigga. When I see you, on sight nigga. Pistols toting nigga pistols blowing nigga. Kream Gang

Part 2: Maxo 187

[Hook]
Maxo 187 nigga
Bangers out, bitch we shooting guns, do this shit for fun
Air em' out, lay em' in the lungs, hope his people come
Spray it out, bullets at your son, I am not the one
Clear it out, this is kingdom come, the killing just begun
Smoked out Locced' out, riding with the pistol grip
Choked out, coked out, bitch we shoot extended clips
If a nigga don't die, then we come back quick
On some crackhead shit, gotta stack bread quick
'Cause we up in this bitch like a dildo, ball like field goal
Motherfuck a Jim Crow, here we go

[Verse 1]
Look out the window, Jeepers Creepers
Scope on choppers call em' peepers
Outliner, hit his grandmomma with the street sweeper
Off the chain I bomb grenades and aim at [?]
No tiki barbers [?] peel his top back like quit lyin
Minute makers bullets silent, mode and violence, starting riots
Pimping bitches, give em' guidance
Fuck these bitches run inside em'
Home invasions, we be robbing, we be mobbing, bullets launching
Niggas jogging, Maxo Gaddafi, Maxo Bin Laden

[Bridge]
Since they shot my brother in the face, I'm on some other shit
I'ma make you suffer nigga, kill your wifey and your kids
Shells in the baby crib, blood on the baby bib
Put your brains in your lap, you lost your mind well there it is
(Ha ha ha, fuck ass nigga)

[Verse 2]
Catch em' on the block, ooh kill em' like Terio
Flame his ass up cremate em', no funeral
I'm a slam dunk bitch nigga you a finger roll
Shooters in the trap and they all on payroll
Niggas try to imitate, chopper bullets penetrate
Marijuana mary jane, Swisha grape elevate
Money talk communicate, robberies I aggravate
Stitch you with assassinate never time to get away
Sip a lot of lean so it's purple when I urinate
Serve a lot of fiends saw up and down the interstate
Move a lot of weight so the plug give me extra faith
Know my money's straight I'll see you in a couple days
Hella' play it cool 'cause the plug ain't safe
Follow him home yeah we know where he stay
Fuck that nigga he taxing anyway
Clean out the safe then hit him with the K

[Bridge]
