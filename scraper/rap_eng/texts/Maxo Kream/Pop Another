[Chorus]
Pop another pill, pop another seal
Pop another pill, pop another seal
Nigga came down with the woman and the grill
Diamonds in my grill worth 'bout a quarter mill
Pop another seal, pop another pill
Pop another seal, pop another pill
Xanax, Seroquel take it like Advil
Lil' blood spill for a hundred dollar bill

[Verse 1]
Chase the Adderall.. with the alcohol
Big Backwood? Yell "Timber!" when it fall
Smokin' on a log, smokin' on a fog
Bustin' down her walls, Niagara Falls
Everybody know what I do with the package
Trappin' like a heathen, I'm a vegan with the cabbage
Hit 'em with the shake, put the Caesar on the salad
Young Anne Frank, I'ma hide it in the attic
84's, Vogues pokin' out like Pinocchio
You a slow poke, hit yo' do' with the okie dope
36 Os, took the 9 like Romo
Trap house boom, I don't hand to hand promo
Servin' that pressure, baggin' up extra
Pills get pressed, Karo stretcher
45 toter, OG smoker
Break down the yola, smellin' like ammonia
Everybody know that I'm 5 Deuce Hoover
Trigger Maxo throw a bow like Luger
Yellow bone Krueger, P90 Ruger
Drank Titanic... down the whole cruiser
Weigh up, bag up, stack up, bag dope
Maxo, Maxo, Maxo, Maxo

[Chorus]
Pop another pill, pop another seal
Pop another pill, pop another seal
Nigga came down with the woman and the grill
Diamonds in my grill worth 'bout a quarter mill
Pop another seal, pop another pill
Pop another seal, pop another pill
Xanax, Seroquel take it like Advil
Lil' blood spill for a hundred dollar bill

[Verse 2]
G37 I feel xantastic
Glock 27 do a drill with the plastic
Young Prodigy, Mobb Deep, cause Havoc
Sellin' broccoli, vacuum sealed up the package
Hail Mary play with the K, John Madden
Tre pound waist, no case, what happened?
Southwest murder block, Crip what's craccin'?
Pimp a hoe, kick a do', trappin' and jackin'
Trappin', no cappin', rappin' and stackin'
Oil like motor, Faygo soda
Coke, no Cola, stretch like yoga
Neck bi-polar, wrist Ebola
Weigh up, bag up, stack up, bag dope
Maxo, Maxo, Maxo, Maxo

[Chorus]
Pop another pill, pop another seal
Pop another pill, pop another seal
Nigga came down with the woman and the grill
Diamonds in my grill worth 'bout a quarter mill
Pop another seal, pop another pill
Pop another seal, pop another pill
Xanax, Seroquel take it like Advil
Lil' blood spill for a hundred dollar bill
