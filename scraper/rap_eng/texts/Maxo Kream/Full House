[Hook]
Got too many people in the trap
Sold out can't even take a nap
There's a knock at the door tap tap
It's a stain asking me where it's at
Got a full house of bad little kids
Ain't even no food in the fridge
12 jays downstairs on the couch
I'm bout to kick everybody out
Can't even chill with my chick
Full house with no oil to sip
Dirty pots and the pans in the sink
The toilet just broke and it stink
Chris Brown stomp the yard get the stepping
Get ready on your mark get the stepping
Like a minute man march get the stepping
[?] You call I'm marching get the stepping

[Verse 1]
Got too many people in the house
No pets just roaches and a mouse
I'm hungry can't get no food
All the pots got work residue
All the neighbors say the weed too loud
Front office say we need to keep it down
3rd time that they've called this week
Next time they gone put us on the street
Oh no I done got the spot hot
Trap stay boomin that's the word on the block
You can stay here but only if you shop
You ain't doing that then you gotta walk it out
Call lil fam like yep yep yep
You been taking all day put a pep in yo step
Say you on the way that's a bet bet bet
Make a right at the light then park on the left
Take your shoes off grandma just swept
Cameras in the front and the back got peeped
Youngins in the back and they just made a mess
Need to take your little bad ass to sleep
Can't serve everybody got to act real hesitant
In my living room got a lot of pedestrians
Ain't got no job got a whole lot of medicine
Aunty smoke work when shes dry she texting me
Seen my uncle mane he was digging in my stash
Had to kick him out then I whooped his bitch ass
Trapped out my grannies house turned 25
Bout to move out man this shit ain't live
Months late and the rent still due
Cable bill and the light bill too
Send them the pack and they move it
I'm bouta' go pack, yeah I'm moving

[Interlude]
[Man I'm tired of this man I'm bouta' get out of here I love you Grandma, but I gotta go man all these kids, uncle stealing all my stuff man look I ain't signed up for this man I'm grown, I'm out, I'm gone, Bye]
