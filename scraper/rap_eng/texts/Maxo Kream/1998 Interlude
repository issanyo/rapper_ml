Just catching up to the crossover
So how do you do this new move?

[Allen Iverson]
I do a slow spin, then let the defender see which direction I'm going in
And once he tries to beat me to the spot, i put the ball behind my back and go in another direction

[Spencer from Reebok]
And then active cushions that stabilizes every step
With avid moves you're never where they expect you to be!

[Allen Iverson]
Yeah I wonder what they'll say about this one
