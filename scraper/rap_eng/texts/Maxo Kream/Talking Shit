[Intro: D Flowers]
Yeah
Free sauce nigga scrappers
We on the way like a mothefucker nigga I'mma
What's flockin' man?
Yeah

[Verse 1: D Flowers]
Tweakin' off the tablets
Leanin' off some Actavis
I might have to smack a bitch
I need that paper like a tablet
I keep that paper like a tablet
I keep them lines like a tablet
I got some baby bottles with the lean
I got some baby mammas mad at me
I'm used to all these hoes harassin' me
I see you haters talkin' blasphemy
I was in class with my pants on my ass had more cash than the staff and the faculty
You had the ruler and I had the Ruger
I had that pack you had some batteries
I had that blow inside a baggie G
You had some cleanex for your allergies
The chopper flip 'em like a spatula
Bust like a pick-up truck they back 'em up
I bet no doctor come and patch 'em up
I bet the chopper come and whack 'em up
We pull up bitch your better Daffy Duck

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
Someone saw nina flip him like a tuck
Knock him out his T-shirt and his dirty chucks
Niggas play dead before they play with us
Better watch the way you talkin' change the way you walkin'
Desert Eagle, Falcon, bullets start to hawkin'
Pull up to your wake, your momma wheezin' coughin'
Thought I saw you pop up so I shot the coffin'
Caught him home alone like Macaulay Culkin
Nina clapped his face from Macaulay Culkin
Nina laughin', I ain't jokin' (HAHA)
Bobby Johnson, left potato smokin'
MAC suppressor make the bullet whisper
Maxo press it make the bullet slow
Hydro hollows fully loaded pistol
Pistol kiss 'em like a mistletoe (MWA!)
All black laser with the pistol grip
Mini chopper shoot it from the hip

[Bridge: D Flowers]
Benihana cook in front your bitch
I could serve but I ain't frontin' shit

[Hook: Maxo Kream]
Okay
Swallow spit, talkin' shit
Flexin' like a walkin' lick
Rounds and clips
Pounds and zips
'Bout it with some counterfeit

[Hook: D Flowers]
You swallow spit, talkin' shit
Flexin' like a walkin' lick
Stalker shit, talkin' shit
Don't think we just talkin' shit

[Verse 3: D Flowers]
Man let me get back just to talk on my shit
You talk that shit now you off in the ditch
Shoot 'em down quick then I'm off in a miss
If I off 'em the dist it ain't nothing to miss
I got you bitch tryin' to cough on the dick
When I need the check shorty walk on the strip
Stay on your tip like a bartender bitch
Cause the money's a must when your arm's [?]

[Verse 4: Maxo Kream]
52  hots get you shot by my crips (KILLER!)
52 shot hit you block I don't miss (BUCK!)
Sherm on a stick call it Bathing Ape piss
Gentle like Sharmin you softer than shit
I'm good with the carbon but nice with the SIG
30 extensions I'm splittin' you wig
Now givin' our phase we been out for the kids
Blowin' back bullets come get you head did

[Verse 5: D Flowers]
How can you talk? Cause you bitch on my dick
I fucked that bitch and got cool with your kids
I'm in the trap and I'm cool as a fridge
I got that crack like a booty lil' bitch

[Verse 6: Maxo Kream]
Serving these packs on her booty and clique
The laws pulls us over, they canâ€™t find the shit
Big dirty bitch she finesse a new trick
I got her a present new ass and new tits

[Hook: Maxo]
Swallow spit, talkin' shit
Flexin' like a walkin' lick

[Hook: D Flowers]
You swallow spit, talkin' shit
Flexin' like a walkin' lick
Stalker shit, talkin' shit
Don't think we just talkin' shit

[Hook: Maxo Kream]
