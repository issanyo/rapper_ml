[Chorus: Maxo Kream]
Sippin' Pimp C, drinkin' Big Moe
Never tipsy, swang and bang slow
Yellow bone freak, rollin' up my dope
Leather suede seats, good Cali smoke
Big backwoods filled up with five grams
Half a pint in a Sprite, call it A$AP Yams
Money good, weed good, but my bitches bad
Grippin' grain, homie, I ain't swangin' in a slab

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Sippin' on that potion
Lifted off this potent
She puffin' I think she need [?]
Smokin', West Coastin'
Kream clique and they locin'
H-Town, we zonin'
Trill bitches, they open
Cause killas still [?]
Rest in peace to Pimp C, I wish I could styrofoam him
Let him know he got the whole world pourin' and pouring
Take your wife I fill your loss in cause you lost one of the [?]
I'm gon' keep your legend alive
That's deep purple in my soul and
Candy paint I still be rollin'
Ready to faint cause I'm still on one
From last night, we took that whole one
About a pint, now watch the snow come
Roll one, bet that fill your whole lung with this uncontrolling, choking, blowing, that I got from Cali coast and straight boss hoggin'

[Chorus: Maxo Kream]
Sippin' Pimp C, drinkin' Big Moe
Never tipsy, swang and bang slow
Yellow bone freak, rollin' up my dope
Leather suede seats, good Cali smoke
Big backwoods filled up with five grams
Half a pint in a Sprite, call it A$AP Yams
Money good, weed good, but my bitches bad
Grippin' grain, homie, I ain't swangin' in a slab

[Verse 2: Killa Kyleon]
Cadillac full of that kush
I got Ferg with me pourin' up drank
A red bone shotgun on my right
Fresh out of Ike [?]
Keep bags like a nigga Saint Nick
Uptown on my one, two, fifth
Cigarillo stay full of that piff
Get money ASAP but a nigga ain't TIP
So tired of ballin' [?]
Cause I chase it daily, no bank
I'm wood holdin', my top foldin', stop tryin' to crawl but I can't
H-Town that staff shit
Actin' like a nigga never had shit
A hundred racks when I pass shit
Your main ho, my last bitch
Arm in water, pull one out the cruiser
Double cup, sippin' Freddy Krueger
Southside, I'm a Houston Cougar
Shakin' these ankles when I maneuver
Tippin', like a bitch strippin', sittin' on a glass [?] when I'm sippin'
My top missin', when you see me dippin'
Gun on my waist but a nigga ain't trippin' (baw)

[Chorus: Maxo Kream]
Sippin' Pimp C, drinkin' Big Moe
Never tipsy, swang and bang slow
Yellow bone freak, rollin' up my dope
Leather suede seats, good Cali smoke
Big backwoods filled up with five grams
Half a pint in a Sprite, call it A$AP Yams
Money good, weed good, but my bitches bad
Grippin' grain, homie, I ain't swangin' in a slab
