[Refrain: Maxo Kream]
I got money comin' I got money goin'
I gotta meet the Migos by the border
My lil hoe, act up, she can't act right
I get the Act right from the border
I spent 8 racks on 10K packs
Told my lil dumb bitch come sort 'em
We got half P's, we got QP's
I ain't sellin'' nothing less than a quarter

[Chorus: Maxo Kream]
Shop with me and place your order
Shop with me and place your order
Shop with me and place your order
If you don't comply then we extort em
Nigga don't act hard, I'm at your backyard
And I'll pull your card, like black jack poker
I sell bars, trap out Goyard
And I give off all my drugs to a worker
Niggas know I'm comin' with it
Niggas know I gotta get it
I'm wrappin' trees like Christmas
I'ma work the work, like fitness

[Chorus Repeating: Maxo Kream]


[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
First of the month, gotta get it
Lots of packs, and I just got evicted
I ain't cryin' I ain't doin' no bitchin'
Hit a stain all back in the kitchen
No dope? Then we sell our women
Got a hoe on the track like Olympics
Put a pot in the stove like a chemist
Bout it, bout it, I ain't got no limits
Bust a pack down like Christmas
Watch the Js come swimming
Won't stop till I finish
First pack it was gone in a minute
Move dope with the quickness
More drugs than a clinic
Got drank and the dro for the low low ticket
I be trappin' on the dub lil nigga come get it
Plug just touched down, met him at the line of scrimmage
Call me Maxo Popeye, cause I move a lot of spinach
I got money comin' I got distribution
I got molly, weed, I got Whitney Houston
I got bitches goin' I got prostitution
This is no illusion, we be sellin' humans
We not smokin' gas, smokin' on pollution
I mix purple drank with karo solution
Took the 8 out, that's a substitution
Is you fuckin' stupid? Bitch, I'm juggin'
Last re-up I ain't pay just took it
I'm a big, call me Maxo Tooki
My lil hoe, on the stove, whippin' cookin'
My lil hoe, on the stove sellin' nookie
A pimp nigga took my hoe with the rookie
Went straight back to the trap, I was juggin'
Got the plug on the phone, place your order
Pack comin' in, I ain't sellin' no quarter

[Refrain: Maxo Kream]
I got money comin' I got money goin'
I gotta meet the migos by the border
My lil hoe, act up, she can't act right
I get the Act right from the border
I spent 8 racks on 10k packs
Told my lil dumb bitch come sort em
We got half P's, we got QP's
And nothing less than a quarter

[Chorus Repeating: Maxo Kream]


[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]
If you don't comply, then you one dead guy
FN's, Tech Nines, shell cases fly
Gotta keep it street, all talk is cheap
My price is cheap, come shop with me
If I drive to you, then I'ma tax a fee
Tell me what you need, we got pills and lean
My green the best, that X I press
I'm servin' tec, not quali-tec
Pull up in my driveway, bitch I'm trappin'
Serve him round the back, neighbors never seen it happen
Take em off the clock, bake em, stash em, double wrap em
Watch out for them ops got them cameras and they snappin'
Got a new stash box compartment
I ain't takin' no loss to a lawman
Fat trappin, south park, call it cartman
Sellin' O's out of bowls in apartments
Nigga had to get it, now a nigga got it
Coppin' two bills, through the bank deposit
Trackin' on the number, got it waitin' on my bundles
Leavin' out the spice, gotta stay humble
