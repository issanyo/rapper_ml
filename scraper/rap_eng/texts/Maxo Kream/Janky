[Intro]
For my niggas with convictions who ain't do it
Who ain't snitchin', locked in prison, spreadin' noodles

[Chorus]
For my niggas in the struggle, goin' through it
They goin' through the struggle, mane, I'm tired of it
Seen some day one niggas change, they up to somethin'
They plottin' on me, actin' strange, I'm waitin' fo' it
They'll smile the day I'm in my grave, I don't trust nothin'
I thought I had some loyal bros, I was trippin'
Seen some real-ass niggas fold, tellin', snitchin'
My mind on my money, mane, 'cause theya take it
Now-a-days can't trust a single soul, 'cause they all janky

[Verse 1]
I used to set up bitch to rob my daddy for a brick and a rollie on his wrist and shot his ass with the pistol
So I been used to get it, till the fam start snitchin'
His own blood sister put him up in prison
My brother got hit with the TEC, in his yard, in his neck
When I catch the fuck nigga, I'ma kill him
Mama still goin' through the struggle with my sister
And my brothers, overtime, workin' double or eviction
So I gotta cop it by the bundle, fill the pot, make it bubble
Cut the cookie cleaner, crumble in the kitchen
Tryna put my niggas on some money till they start movin' funny Everytime I turn around, they stealin'
Niggas ain't solid, fake like cut dope
Down since toddlers, daycare, jump rope
Had to rob my partner, had to get cutthroat
Trap got slow, me and juice sold soap
I used to sleep with no mattress, [?]
Eat noodles to manage, Me, Ju, Josh and Alice
Need clothes to go to school, so I slang pot
No Jordans, "2 for $89" Reeboks
I was 12 Chuck E. Cheese, playin' lil league
Robbin niggas, servin' fiends by 13
Became a grown man, it was overnight
I had nobody to guide me right
Went through the dirt then it start to rain
Came from the mud with some struggle pains
Cops took my shine, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy
Put me on TV like Ray Charles, Stevie
Blind the whole town, feds kick the door down
Organized crime, that's a 5 to 99
In court gettin' judged by a twelve whites
Who never had to struggle in they God damn life

[Bridge]
Skippin' school to serve my junkies, I was truant
Robbin niggas take they money, I was boostin'
For all my niggas in the struggle goin' through it

[Chorus]
They goin' through the struggle, mane, I'm tired of it
Seen some day one niggas change, they up to somethin'
They plottin' on me, actin' strange, I'm waitin' fo' it
They smile the day I'm in my grave, I don't trust no one
I thought I had some loyal bros, I was trippin'
Seen some real-ass niggas fold, tellin', snitchin'
My mind on my money, mane, 'cause theya take it
Now-a-days can't trust a single soul, 'cause they all janky
