[Pre-Chorus]
Lil momma, why you gotta nigga stressin'?
Lil momma, why you gotta ask questions?
Why you worried 'bout the hoes I'm textin'?
Why you going through my phone text message?
I be creepin' on the low, can't help it
I be sippin' on the four, can't help it
Takin' percs to the face like a selfie
Molly rocks, I'ma roll like Elvis

[Chorus]
I choose the percs over you, aye
I choose the syrup over you, aye
I put the herb in the leaf like it's autumn
I’m on the syrup like a pancake or waffle
Just like a baby, I sip out the bottle
Still on the pint, I'ma pour out the bottle
Tropical Sprite with codeine at the bottom
Mix it together, at first it was separate
We always fightin', we better off separate
I sip the Qualitest when I get desperate
I ate a Xannie and instantly felt it
You or the drugs, is it really a question?
I choose the percs over you
I choose the syrup over you
Love is a drug and I think I'm addicted
Call up my doctor, I need a prescription

[Verse]
Call me 'bout nothin', huffin' and puffin'
Everyday fussin', makin' up assumptions
Insecure bitch think I'm always doin' somethin'
Worry about no hoe, I'm chasin' that money
Pop four dummies, cup too muddy
Weed too gummy, chain too sunny
Tryna get high, can't deal with the drama
Basic lil hoe, act just like her momma
Say I need help, I'm a junkie, I'm an addict
Just 'cause I mix the codeine with the Addies
Narco somas, bag dope with the Xannies
Work a nigga nerves and I'm just tryna manage
Mary Jane never talk back
Molly don't give me no slack (lil hoe)
Lil drank, Act know how to act
Married to the dope, ain't never turnin' back

[Pre-Chorus]
Lil momma, why you got a nigga stressin'?
Lil momma, why you gotta ask questions?
Why you worried 'bout the hoes I'm textin'?
Why you going through my phone text message?
I be creepin' on the low, can't help it
I be sippin' on the four, can't help it
Takin' percs to the face like a selfie
Molly rocks, I'ma roll like Elvis

[Chorus]
I choose the percs over you (aye)
I choose the syrup over you (aye)
I put the herb in the leaf like it's autumn
I’m on the syrup like a pancake or waffle
Just like a baby, I sip out the bottle
Still on the pint, I'ma pour out the bottle
Tropical Sprite with codeine at the bottom
Mix it together, at first it was separate
We always fightin', we better off separate
I sip the Qualitest when I get desperate
I ate a Xannie and instantly felt it
You or the drugs, is it really a question?
I choose the percs over you
I choose the syrup over you
Love is a drug and I think I'm addicted
Call up my doctor, I need a prescription
