We gon' get through it I know it

Nigga just gotta be patient
A nigga just gotta have faith
Nigga chill out we gon' make it
Nigga chill out we gon' make it
Nigga hold on we get through it
All of the money get to us
All of these bitches get naked
All of these bitches wan' use us
But it's okay it's okay
'Cause we gonna find us a way
We gon' get through it I know it
We gon' get through it I know it

[Verse 1: Unotheactivist]
Told my lil brother don't worry
All of these bitches they come in a hurry
My diamonds never are blurry
Really coming in flying in a flurry
I might shoot like Stephen Curry
I might pull up and hop out the Curry
I know that you wanna hurt me
But she gon' swallow
She swallow like hurry
Middle finger to the jury
Never kept me, gone
Nigga I'm on top of the jet
I'm kicking shit like Jet Lee
Niggas just wanna come and flex
But I feel like Hercules
Niggas said they want beef
I'm ballin' like seasame seeds

[Verse 2:Maxo Kream]
We gon' get through it I know it
Free all my brothers they holdin'
These niggas they snitchin' they bogus
We get in the [?] for the Jordans
Remember the Bic they smoking
Sippin' on act 'till it's boring
Trappin' at six in the morning
Two 45's and they going
These niggas they fake counterfeit
How you [?] but you snitch
How you crip but you tell on a crip
Niggas turn on you like a light switch
Keep some [?] like a gutter or ditch
For my brother I let off a clip
For my brother put you in the soil
Left my brothers my niggas ain't loyal

[Verse 3: Thouxanbandfauni]
My fingers so sticky
My palms getting itchy
These niggas so glitchy
As she constantly bitches
She constantly bitches
These bitches so bitchy
Gang with me when we out in the city
Man who the fuck fucked your [?]
Got some clout and some fetti you petty
Got some clout and some fetti you petty
Your own shadow leaves you out in the dark
When shit gets dark
Aye lil mama back it up
Like a superstar like Rosa Parks
I came with the wolves
And all of my dogs
That noise you hear that's the bark
Aye all of these niggas some sharks
You say you got narcotics
You just a narc
