[Intro]
Yeah, I need a real ass bitch, a down bitch, pistol popping and still keep them red bottoms, that's my swag

[Hook]
Shawty' give good head, fitted cap styled up
Runnin back the pussy Iâ€™m a giant Tiki Barber
Favorite shoes Jordans, anything she order
Young fast bitch so I'ma race car spoiler
She say she want a baller, shot caller
I beat it off the Backwood, make her friend record us
She say she want a baller, shot caller
I beat it off the Backwood, make her friend record us

[Verse 2]
Fresh on the scene looking clean, Jordans green bean
Shawty' looking mean, I'm a fiend, pockets creatine
Heard about the Kream, that's my team, fresh as Listerine
We ball like Mr. Clean, sneaker addicts, need some nicotine
Nigga please, act like Maxo ain't cracking
Like a high note singer breaking glasses in the Chapel
Won the WWE, put your body in a grapple
Bet you I could make you choke like a freestyle battle
Put it in and out your mouth, Chuck E Cheese I got tokens
Call me when you're home alone, I'm the young Macaulay Culkin
Know I'm cripping and I'm sipping, steady tipping on the block
If you tripping, leave you lipping and [?] with the Glock

[Hook]
Shawty' give good head, fitted cap styled up
Running back the pussy I'm a giant Tiki Barber
Favorite shoes Jordans, anything she order
Young fast bitch so I'ma race car spoiler
She say she want a baller, shot caller
I beat it off the Backwood, make her friend record us
She say she want a baller, shot caller
I beat it off the Backwood, make her friend record us

[Verse 2]
Ass looking fat like Rick Ross up in weight watchers
Trapping on the block, ducking cops, call it weight watchers
Me and shawty get it poppin, Mr. Orville Redenbacher
Chain golden like an Oscar, Got goals like Poppa's
Bored 07' partner, never sweating lady drama
Bitch Nina got the Llama, Tommy Mac me chopper
Jeana know I'm cold, ask Martin with the Tommy
Word to chest, gun to him, he'll figure with the chopper

[Hook]
Shawty' give good head, fitted cap styled up
Running back the pussy I'm a giant Tiki Barber
Favorite shoes Jordans, anything she order
Young fast bitch so I'ma race car spoiler
She say she want a baller, shot caller
I beat it off the Backwood, make her friend record us
She say she want a baller, shot caller
I beat it off the Backwood, make her friend record us
Shawty' give good head, fitted cap styled up
Running back the pussy I'm a giant Tiki Barber
Favorite shoes Jordans, anything she order
Young fast bitch so I'ma race car spoiler
She say she want a baller, shot caller
I beat it off the Backwood, make her friend record us
She say she want a baller, shot caller
I beat it off the Backwood, make her friend record us
