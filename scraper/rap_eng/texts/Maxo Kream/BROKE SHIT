[Verse 1]
Roll wit my niggas you ain't with the mob
Making them figures, no bitch on a time
If she too clingy im bringing her close
Fire no fighter, Im bringing the hoes
Pussy ass niggas be claiming they keeping a 30
I call it apostrophe
She wanna hang with my niggas on daily
Well little bitch you gotta pay a fee
Ride with a different Bitch
She wanna different dick
Calling my dick a camel
Got her to ride with no handles
Demolition she dismantled
But I dont break her down
Break Into a nigga woods
You want her back wish you could

She on her knees, Oh lord
Her mama thought that she was praying
Yeah Ima hot boy
Thought she was sucking up satan
Caught with the law but Im not on a run
Know some real killers that shoot you for fun
Heard you protected boy he took your gun
Came with no hittas you stupid, to dumb
Flipping get boring when you got the clout
Money to easy If she got the mouth
What ?


Mouth, Full, Of Drought, Aye
Let me go wet up ya problem
Pop on yo block like a blossom
Yeah issa wrap like a condom
Cold on my wrist like December
But we just going to Autumn
Bring em on out
She want the white but it go In her snout
Way too much benjys im losing the count
Try to go rob ya body won't be found
Yeah we on top like a dog when we mount

[Verse 2]
If you ain't gone tell me I press you on call
Pray to the lord that my niggas gone ball
Never gone switch up enless Its a lane
10 a g, What you thought you got no brain
Raising the price and they call me a crane
Swear they want flight she gone go for the fame
Left a hoe limping might just need a cane
If you ain't fucking dont know why you came
