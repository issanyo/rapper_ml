[Verse 1]
Throw me in the water, watch me sink to the bottom
Then hold on to my belongings ‘cause you can’t live without them
You keep saying that you love me but what you don’t know about me
Is that I don’t even love myself so how the fuck could I love you?
I don’t need no guns to back me up, I don’t need your love if you got to try
All I really need is nothing, see this life is just a lie
My favorite time is when it’s me in the dark with a beat
Bad thoughts in my head, blunt guts at my feet
Got my blade in the right and some drugs up in my left
Love the sound of the silence I just wish it would never end

[Hook]
Lights down, bass loud, everything stop
When the air gets cold know that Bones is on your block
See the lights down, bass loud, everything stop
It’s the young living legend with another fucking drop

[Verse 2]
Back up in the fucking flow
I ain’t gripping on the scope
I ain’t pimping fucking hoes
I ain’t riding in the Rolls
Looking like a fucking ghost
Gliding like a fucking bat
Doping on the fucking porch
It’s best you do not come with that

[Hook]
Lights down, bass loud, everything stop
When the air gets cold know that Bones is on your block
Lights down, bass loud, everything stop
It’s the young living legend with another fucking drop
