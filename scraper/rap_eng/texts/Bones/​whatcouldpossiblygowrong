[Intro]
-Oh, hi Christian
-Hi! Why is it so dark in here?
-Well, you'll find out later. See that mark I have on the rug there?
-Yes
-Well, go stand on it
-Okay
-Okay, what do you see?
-You
-You know, I have magical powers and all I have to do is a little twiddling down here, and now what do you see?
-You're turning into a skeleton
-Yes

[Verse]
While you're out there settling
I will turn to a skeleton
All you've ever longed for is relevance
I'm bursting at the seams with elegance
Some might say I'm heaven sent
I just say they're full of shit because
I never asked for this
We never asked
We never asked for this

[Hook]
Now nobody wants me
Now nobody wants me
Now nobody wants me
Now nobody wants me
Now nobody wants me

[Outro]
-And in spite of fact that I have disappeared
And am now in the neverlether world
Can you hear me alright?
-Yes I still can
-Okay, good. And I also have enough magical powers
To return to everyday life, watch…
-Wow, you’re coming back
-Yes, and now I'm back whole again, right?
-Right…
