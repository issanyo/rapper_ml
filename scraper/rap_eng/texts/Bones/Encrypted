[Intro:]
You are in the mix with DJ Stinkynuts
Welcome back ladies and gentleman
This is your boy DJ Stinkynuts
With the 1 & 2
Today with have a smash hit from Drew the Architect, Smitty the BG and Bones
As My Uncle Rick says, “Let em Fuckin' Drag”

[Verse:]
You've have always seemed to know
Just what I have been needing, oh
You've have always been the one
Even when there is no one
If I freeze and overload
I'm still encrypted with your code
You've have always seemed to know
Just what I have been needing, oh

[Hook:]
You're all I want to know
You're all I want to know
You're all I want to know
You're all I want to know
You're all I want to know
You're all I want to know
