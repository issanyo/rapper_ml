[Verse 1: Bones]
What?
Light creeping through my window
As I rise I roll a blunt
Eyes closed when I smoke
I'll wake up when I'm done
Concrete meet the water
Where I take in the sun
Linkin Park when I spark
Every wood got me Numb
Candles lit, fan spinnin'
Feet up on the leather
Sesh burned in the game
Like the seal of a letter
No checks just cash keep it clean
Briefcase with the code you would need
Blunt guts drip drip
When I bleed

[Hook: Bones]
Blunt guts drip drip
When I bleed
Blunt guts drip drip
When I bleed
Blunt guts drip drip
When I bleed
Blunt guts drip drip
When I bleed
