[Verse]
As the ship goes down I see land
The water temperature is low but we can
Get to shore, I promise I want it more
Than any desire that I've ever had before
I miss the earth, but only when you are in it
I don't need the lungs come the day you stop breathing
I know that I should calm down
I breathe in and out
But that don't help me now
No that don't help me now

[Hook]
Is this what you wanted? I don't think so
Is this what you wanted? I don't think so
Is this what you wanted? I don't think so
Is this what you wanted? I don't think so

Every little thing that you do
Is my favourite thing you do
