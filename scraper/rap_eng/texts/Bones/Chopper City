[Verse 1]
My mama raised me well
My daddy raised me well
My brother keep me fed, keep a roof over my head
That bass up in your trunk, them drugs up in your blunt
That song stuck in your head, bitch I'm that smoke inside of your lungs
I'm coming through with that new sound, put you on to that SESH shit
You pick a trend, you hop on it, then hop off to that next shit
Motherfuck' your life, don't mention me
I don't want your name in my mention feed
You can try your best, still ain't affecting me
See I spark a blunt and play Tekken 3
Playstation, play making
Flip a brick, then I Harlem shake it
Riding scrapers, born in Oakland
Making money like I'm out in Vegas
Hit the slide, coward watch
Same one that B.G. got
On the front cover of that Chopper City
Rolex rocking like slingshots
Raise a chopper like beam shots
No evidence, no trace
My chain shine like night
Like hit the glue on that grey
See I'm kissin' roses, if you didn't notice
Getting cash while I'm staying focused
Ginger ale in my glass and you know that Glock on the dash stay loaded

[Hook]
Kicking typical raps, banging beats, flicking ash
Get back, get back, you don't know me like that
Kicking typical raps, banging beats, flicking ash
It's the young night rat, getting money, getting cash

[Bridge]
Everybody wanna sound like me
Everybody wanna act like me
Everybody wanna look like me
Everybody wanna rap like me

[Outro] x2
Uh, stop it, you can't do it
Now stand back and let me do it
Bitch you can keep that 'Rari
I'd rather whip around in that Buick
