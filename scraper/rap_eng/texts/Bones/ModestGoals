[Verse]
They give you modest goals and honest roles to play
They told me no and I turned and ran away
Calling me was a whole new life something I've never felt
Beckoning like screaming words not spoken they were yelled

[Hook]
In the end if I'm the one to blame
I will take my life and cut my ties today
In the end if I'm the one to blame
I will take my life and cut my ties today
In the end if I'm the one to blame
I will take my life and cut my ties today
