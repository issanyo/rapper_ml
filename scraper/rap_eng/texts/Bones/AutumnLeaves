[Verse 1: Bones]
No Glock in the dashboard
No need to grab yours
Blade in my jeans, you can get it if you ask for it
Rewind, fast forward, pause
Let me ash, boy
Every time I see your bitch, she always wanna chat, boy

[Hook: Kool G Rap]
Living the life of Riley, packing 50 Cali's
Rocking Lizard Bally's while we do a drug deal in a dark alley
Living the life of Riley, packing 50 Cali's
Rocking Lizard Bally's while we do a drug deal in a dark alley
Living the life of Riley, packing 50 Cali's
Rocking Lizard Bally's while we do a drug deal in a dark alley
Living the life of Riley, packing 50 Cali's
Rocking Lizard Bally's while we do a drug deal in a dark alley

[Verse 2: Bones]
Young white renegade
Feelin' like it's seventh grade
Backpack, razorblades
Bitch, I'm in the trash-can
Fresh squeezed lemonade
Ash while I'm sipping
I look like Nick Lachey so my girl like Jessica Simpson
I ain't whippin' or pimpin'
I'm at the house relaxin'
Don't know that you girl's with me relapsin'

[Hook: Bones]
I hope the day that you die, there will be nobody there for you (nobody there!)
I hope the day that you die, there will be nobody there for you (So I'll be there for you)
I hope the day that you die, there will be nobody there for you (nobody there!)
I hope the day that you die, there will be nobody there for you (So I'll be there for you)
