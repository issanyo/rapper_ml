[Verse 1: Bones]
Rip my heart up through my chest
Rip the veins up out my flesh
Put the dope in the wood
Couldn't flow if you could
Still thinking that you the best
You say you got them fans, but at your show they just stand
You say you got them bands, but you still living with your dad
Young Dylan Klebold
Verse full of keynotes
Bombs in the Lunchroom, teenage freak show
I ain't loading guns, I'm rolling up some blunts
I got life up in my glass, I got death up in my lungs
What, wait...

[Chorus: Bones]
I hurt everyone
I don't deserve anyone
I will let you down
In the end, I'll let you down
