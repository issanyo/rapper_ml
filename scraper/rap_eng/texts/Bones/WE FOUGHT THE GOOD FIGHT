[Verse 1]
I've been trying my hardest
To look at things a little differently
But I can't drop my nonsense
I gotta live with it, rather it lives in me
I know that I just can't keep talking
Because words slowly don't mean a thing
When I have used them all so often
Trying to go back is like trying to stop the rain

[Hook]
It's always storming in this head of mine
Sick of the weather here want to leave me all behind
Sun has never been my cup of tea
But I'll get down on hands and knees
Sun bleach infinity

[Outro]
Watch me burn
Watch me burn
Watch me burn
Watch me burn
Watch me burn
