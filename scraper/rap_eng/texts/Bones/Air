[Verse 1]
The first time was the last time
The last time felt like the first time
I'm trying to find the place deep inside
I can be all by myself tonight
I be smoking too much, be sober too little
My mother told me stop as I'm gutting up a Swisher
The way that I be living I hope that I see my children
See them break my rules, see them doing what they shouldn't
Middle of the night, outside by myself
Breathing in the air, hoping that it ends well
Silence in my ear, too loud, can't hear
Echoes in the streets be the sound of the breeze

[Hook]
I miss the life that I had with you
I close my eyes, hope to see you soon
I miss the life that I had with you
I close my eyes, hope to see you soon
I miss the life that I had with you
I close my eyes, hope to see you soon
I miss the life that I had with you
I close my eyes, hope to see you soon
