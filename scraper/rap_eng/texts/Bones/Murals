[Verse 1]
My chain shine like moonlight
My hand looks like Saturn
I gotta buncha rings, with a buncha rocks
Thats all diamonds and platinum
See I'm somewhere thats real far from you
Say you sound like me thats far from truth
If you only knew that I've been it dude
I've been around the block see I'm far from new
Far from you, Far from the world
From ya house
Far from ya girl
You can have it all, You can have it all
I light blunt she like adderall
Keep it girl I don't want ya call
Keep ya life I don't want ya bars
98' and I'm Kid Rock feel the bass bang bawitadaba
Expensive cars
Designer rags
No brand name got nothin' on my tags
Bumpin' in the Lac
Rollin' in the back
Gotta brick fulla' dope and that pack for tha rats
Gotta black Mac-10 and it boom like bap
Tanquray showers, Alize baths
Five bedrooms and they all be the same
Walls made of gold, Waterbed fulla lean

[Hook 1]
Marble floor, blunt connoisseurs
Champagne I got bottles full
Livin' life like a fuckin' prince
It ain't about me then they kiss the gold [x2]

[Hook 2]
Murals on my ceiling (ceiling)
Pearls on my necklace (necklace)
Bitches' feeding me grapes I guess it's fresh fruit for breakfast [x2]
