[Intro]
I can be everything you need, if you make me

"That's it I'm leaving the business, you know, all these people never see me again. That's it, for one year nobody hears anything, before it was like you die and one week later and you come back. For one year nobody hears anything, we have the gravestone and the whole thing, and then you come back again. Where is this going to lead to I wonder?"

"I don't know, I don't know, I think this could be a real masterpiece, this record, this really could be a masterpiece."

(If you make me)

"I have to go"
