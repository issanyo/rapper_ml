[Verse 1]
You ain't slangin stop, I pull up
Parking lots, you ain't arranging rocks, I know that
You think it's hard cause you've seen it done
Slash heard, you're a sponge, never be your own
Man, can't you understand how I came in the game?
Yeah me neither, no breathin', it's amazing I make
My way out the other side of my personal maze
I was stuffed for a minute, couldn't feel my legs
I had to bounce, back, like the rubber band snap
Round the ziplock bag full of money that we stashed
In the wall downstairs, that was back in 2010
I was just about to leave, no one knew just how to feel
But I did, that's why I wait and feel
Calm inside cause I am real
I am me and you are you
Running around tryin' to chase this loot
Hop straight back in and then I glist to the finish
White noise in the flesh, hair down, never see me
I done tried to make it clear, I do not think that they hear me
Mic check, 1, 2,  Ri-ri-rick in the building
Got my hi-vis and my blade look like I'm building
On the site with my clipboard, smoking and chilling
No hard hat, no whistle, still officially killing
Every fucking working brain within a arms length distance
You get melted into ashes and I'm casting you to iron
Turn you to a blade of mine, so I can use your life in spite
I make cash all night, fuck your money and your ice
You ain't helping nobody with the shitty words you write

[Outro]
Think about it
Think about it
Think about it
Think about it
