[Verse]
Hey
I'm Satan's gift to the twenty first century
Shitting in brown bags and lighting them on your porch to see
Exactly how much shit you can take from me
Ding Dong ditching these rappers until they start to plead insanity
The baddest kid on the block
Bullet pop
A bad temper makes me weed and some rock
I got people saying the paying attention to shit
But you gotta stay humble without you mentioning shit
Bitch
I'm on another level
You can't surpass me
My teacher's knew that too, that's why they never passed me
Maybe actually the problem went and practically blew up in my face
When I didn't do my maths sheets
But they did teaching for everyone for everything that they teach us
There was one bad kid ditching class on the bleachers
And that was me
Hello world
Coming live from the place with Hollywood girls
I'm drunk down and tryna holla at your bitch
I told her if she bring a friend, we can all split like
Banana peels, abundant gorilla thugs, you feel me?
Little bitches while I'm Mighty Joe Young
See
I'm fresh out the Styx
While dirt roads back home weren't leading me to shit
So, I said fuck it
I moved away now I wake and live the California Dream everyday
My teachers use to hold me after when I did wrong
And asked me what I wanna do
I'd say rap songs
They got to laughing everytime that I said it
Now I get emails saying that they regret it
