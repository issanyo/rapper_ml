[Hook]
Witch boy, witch boy, creepin' out the Styx boy
Long hair, long hair, lookin' like a bitch boy
White trash, white trash, blame that shit on Michigan
Troubled youth, troubled youth, mama gon' be missin me
Witch boy, witch boy, creepin' out the Styx boy
Long hair, long hair, lookin' like a bitch boy

[Verse]
I ain't ridin round in no Lamborghinis
Can't fuck with me like a bitch on her period
Can't fuck with me like a bitch and that's period
In the pickup, bumpin' sesh, sippin artesian
I'm a young dumb fuck with a bad attitude
Like a rifle, I raise it and aim it at you
Great head of hair and a velvet voice
I just look like death sitting in on my corpse

[Hook]
Witch boy, witch boy, creepin' out the Styx boy
Long hair, long hair, lookin' like a bitch boy
White trash, white trash, blame that shit on Michigan
Troubled youth, troubled youth, mama gon' be missin me
Witch boy, witch boy
