[Verse]
My brain's betrayed me and my heartâ€™s fallen numb
My body shuts down, is it really all that simple to try and walk

[Chorus]
Better safe than sorry, I remain seated throughout the night
Leave me broken, just go on, I won't tell you to hold on
Leave me broken, just go on, I won't tell you to hold on

[Outro]
I love you more than I love myself
Oh, oh, I will wait for you
Oh, oh, I will wait
Oh, oh, I will wait for you
Oh, oh, I will wait
