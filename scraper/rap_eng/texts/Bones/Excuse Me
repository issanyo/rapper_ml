[Chorus]
It's the lonely girl
In the lonely world
Got every man asking you Please now be my girl
(Be my girl)
(Be my girl)
(Please be my girl)
Hella loaded cherry sucker for some of the finest things
Blinded by the light of the prices on all of the diamond rings;
But, see
No matter what the price
You gone be alone at the end of the night

[Verse]
You gone be alone at the end of the night
You feelin' right
And you don't listen to advice on how to live your life right (life right)
So accustomed to the (fast life)
That you screaming fuck everybody cause this is your night
Pretty hazel eyes, I know she's been staring at me
I could take her home but tommorow she'll forget about me
Wake up (wake up), she gone
A note on the table saying she had fun

[Chorus]
It's the lonely girl
In the lonely world
Got every man asking you Please now be my girl
(Be my girl)
(Be my girl)
(Please be my girl)
Hella loaded cherry sucker for some of the finest things
Blinded by the light of the prices on all of the diamond rings;
But, see
No matter what the price
You gone be alone at the end of the night
