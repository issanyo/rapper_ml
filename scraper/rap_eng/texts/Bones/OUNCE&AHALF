[Verse 1: Th@ Kid]

There's an ounce and a half in the bag
There's a new pack of swishers on the dash
There's a tape in the deck
There's a foot up on the gas
There ain't' no car on the road
So I'm about to go fast
Got a rap on smash
Got that sling-shot on my lap
Got a bag full of rocks
I ain't' slanging no crack
Just a young dumb fuck
With the tendencies to blast
Like blastoise hydro-pump this bullet through my gat
Through your brain, catch the fake
Can't just can't just catch a break
Tired of kicking out all these flows
And drowning bitches with my waves
That's a lie, I ain't tired I do this shit like every day
Motherfuck the VMAs, motherfuck these record labels
I ain't' trying to make a name, I ain't' trying to get the fame
I'm just trying to get some change, go and cop a bigger chain
Buy a house for my team, basement full of weed
'fridgerator full of drinks, champagne and sunny D
Fuck a big flat screen, got a movie theater in my room
Big chairs everywhere glass screen bullet proof
