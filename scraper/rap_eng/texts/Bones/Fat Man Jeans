[Intro]
What's up dude
Uh
That's whats up dude
I'm coming in rawer than ever (Raw man)
All the top heads of the hip hop game better move out of the way (Look out)
I'm coming for you OJ da Juiceman

[Verse 1]
I think I rapped on this when I was 10 years old
Man damn time flies when you cryogenic cold
You sport the ice creams with cones on the [?] then I started rocking hoodies with the ape logo, man
And that was back in 7th grade, all the kids sayin' that shits evolved away?
Moon man on the tag diamond dollar on the sleeve, where'd you get that Elmo, man just let me [?]
Selling CDs outta my locker at 13
MP3s scheming how to get to my dreams, cuz
I been having many so, many a [?]
I can't fall back asleep, can't do another thing till I
Make that motherfuck a reality, spike strip mentality, strike it until you proud of me
Frozen for a minute, now I'm cave man stupid
Back to ruining plans of those who said I couldn't, do it

[Outro]
That's right man, do it
I giggity get it, you know what I'm sayin' dude?
But, um, like I was saying earlier, OJ da Juiceman you're pretty much like, knocked off that rap totem pole after this one dude
Back to the bottom you go Juiceman, with those fuckin' fat man jeans
This is an official diss by the way
