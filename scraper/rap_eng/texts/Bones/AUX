[Hook]
Smokin' the finest
Stop and rewind this
I shop like the climate
Fuck what your time is
Drippin' in diamonds, we shinin'
Smokin' the finest
Stop and rewind this
I shop like the climate
Fuck what your time is
Drippin' in diamonds, we shinin'

[Verse]
I'm gettin' paid from the west to the east
I'm wild'n I really gotta sleep
Fuck ya dope, cause ya boy gotta eat
Every city, every night, with the team
Break it in just to throw it in the breeze
Cut stones on my knuckles and they clean
Break it in just to throw it in the breeze
Cut stones on my knuckles and they clean

[Bridge]
From the jump
Only cracker that's crackin' this rap shit
From the jump
My face make them freeze, but that razor with me
Make 'em jump
Guttin', Unravelin', repeat until I am numb
From the jump
Only cracker that's crackin' this rap shit
From the jump
My face make them freeze, but that razor with me
Make 'em jump
Guttin', Unravelin', repeat until I am numb
