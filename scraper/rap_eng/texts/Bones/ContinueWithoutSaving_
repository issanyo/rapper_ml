[Hook]
It's you and me, baby, first things first, these blunts are waiting
I'm impatient, anxious, hoping I can get an answer
You've always known exactly what to say to make it better

[Verse 1]
James Stewart, dangerous, got no angels saving us
Jumping off the bridge into 20 below water
Use to get good sleep now every night's a nightmare
Don't do what I did, you will be sorry, I swear
There is never a day that I feel indifferent
Feel indifferent
Feel indifferent

[Bridge]
There will never be a time that I am (What? What)
If all goes according to plan (What? What?)
There will never be a time that I am (What? What?)
If all goes according to plan (What? What?)
There will never be a time that I am (What? What?)
If all goes according to plan (Wait)

[Hook]
It's you and me, baby, first things first, these blunts are waiting
I'm impatient, anxious, hoping I can get an answer
You've always known exactly what to say to make it better

[Outro]
Make it "good time" all the time
Make it "good time" all the time

[Skit]
Uh... Okay, guys, it's Vernon, the voicebox of the underground
You know what? Emotional Bones is the best Bones
You know what, man? In second thought, I don't even like rap music. That singing shit, that's, that's, it really hits home
Yeah, learn something new everyday
