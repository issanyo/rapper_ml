[Verse]
My insecurities swiftly cover me like armor
Head to toe, I'm untarnished
The best on the market stand forever unpunctured
The prime example left the scene now it don't function
I can handle resentment in abundance
My DNA is made of regrets and sunsets
Reset on my back, I can't touch it
Won't go back to the beginning if I had the option

[Outro]
Wait
Too much focused on dying I forgot to think about living
Just wanted an introspective minute
What
Got to think about living, just wanted an introspective minute
What
