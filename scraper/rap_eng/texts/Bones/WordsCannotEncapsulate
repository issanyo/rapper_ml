[Verse 1]
People crying, people dying
I just hope we can, I just hope we can
Find a way, find a way
Find a way to do something, find a way to do something
When the walls cave in now, who do you turn to?
When everything's lost, who do you run to?
If you got someone you're a lucky one
Because I'm living in the world with nobody there, no
But you don't live with that, no
So don't give me that, no
I get high sometimes, I realize sometimes
Just like everybody

[Verse 2]
Underwater I'm caught up in emotion
Like I'm sleeping at the bottom of the ocean
Underwater I'm caught up in emotion
Like I'm sinking, sinking with the ocean
Underwater I'm caught up in emotion
Like I'm singing, yeah singing in the ocean
Underwater I'm caught up in emotion
So now I'm sleeping, yeah sleeping with the ocean

[Outro]
I'm just sleeping in the ocean
And you didn't know
