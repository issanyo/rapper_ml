[Verse 1: Bones]
Everybody wanna smoke, but don't wanna get high
Everybody wanna live, but nobody wanna die
Everybody wanna flow, but all they fuckin' do is rhyme
Everybody wanna know, how I got so fuckin' tight
No school, lotta drugs, ten grand worth of Backwoods
Bitch I got it bad, so it's hard for me to act good
Amethyst rings, rare rocks help me breathe
Inhale, blow the smoke, like a candle in the breeze
No keys, no keys, I ain't pushin' what you think
Everytime I hear your music, make it hard for me to think
No strap, no blade, still I take your life away
Never smile, always high, way higher than you think
Black granite on my sink, white marble on the counter tops
Livin' so lavish, oak doors when i fuckin' knock
Runnin up the fuckin' block, dope up in my fuckin' sock
Stop, go to fuckin' cops, but I keep bookin' and never stop

[Outro: Bones]
Let me breathe, I just need some time just so
So I can think, I just need some air baby
Now what you think, me and you forever that would
Be a dream, whatever you need tell me
Whatever you need tell me
I can try my best to get it for you
