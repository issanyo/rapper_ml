[Verse]
How can you see through my flaws when there are just so many of them
Like you can see through walls, I'm amazed by your super human vision
Every moment is appreciated, it's never taken
For granted, granted some of my actions they indicate that
Everything's a lie, but it's not
I will be here 'til the sun goes down

[Outro]
How can you see through my flaws when there are just so many of them
Like you can see through walls, I'm amazed by your super human vision
Every moment is appreciated, it's never taken
For granted, granted some of my actions they indicate that
Everything's a lie, but it's not
I will be here 'til the sun goes down
