[Verse 1]

I'm in a Maybach cruisin'
That shit foolish
Gimme two wheels and a seat I'm cool with it
So Joe cool with it, lay back chill type
Dark ass shades Johnny cage ain't this nice

[Hook 1] x2

I think I was a rapper in my past life
With that said, let's get rich twice

[Verse 2]

Got money on my mind like Weezy
Rock dark ass frames like Eazy
Flow radder like Master P
Team SESH be an army, B. Geezy
I'm really real but I ain't gotta say it
If you gotta hose you ain't gotta spray it
You know I rock this bitch like Amadeus
And I'm here all day, shit, nobody could save ya
It's the year of the rat
Team SESH plus that bitch you do the math
Money in the bath
All my screens flat
All my things flashy
All my clothes black

[Hook 2] x2

Everything black, black
Young Johnny Cash, Cash
