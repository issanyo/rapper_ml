[Verse]
Heard a couple songs, now they thinking that they know me
I ain't taking calls to the world, I'm always roaming
Never need the time, so I never had a Rollie
Do it just us, so we never hear you owe me
Making sure we straight we put the money where we need to
Couple commas later, It ain't even been a week to
Blow the world a kiss and tell it I'll be back
Never I got, weather to be weathered
There's some hands up to be severed
But there's a seed I gotta plant
There's a line to be drawn
In the dirt, in the earth 150 feet down
I don't believe in the shit but it's heaven and it's hell
Could have took a "L" with the label
Instead, I make bands with El, what?
