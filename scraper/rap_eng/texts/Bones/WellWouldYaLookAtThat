Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

[Verse 1: Bones]
Real tree when I'm creeping so you never see me
Since I can't stop making money, diamonds won't stop gleaming
Hundred blunts just because, bitch it tis' the season
If you want to talk a feature you need to book a meeting
Every time we drop some shit the internet get freezing
Bitch I'm skinny like I'm Kel but these blunts on Kenan
Anything we start they try and come and finish
They say it's theirs and they hate the team cause they ain't up in it
Once I start a fire I don't ever finish
Can't feel my legs, this dope got me kneeling like a Christian
Bitch we still will fuck shit up
Sliding around with the windows up

[Verse 2: Xavier Wulf]
When I arrive to his section, his protection can't protect him now
He can say he sorry but apology won't help him out
You pull up to the venue, you see the helicopter buzz around
Police mad as fuck, cause we smoke who ever sittin' out
Your sis be at the show, with her motherfucking titties out
We hop out off the stage, see her begging us to touch her now
I can't trust a bitch, with that reason, they be running round
It's funny now, I could tell you stories about tour style
Lifestyle, lovely, Latina woman favor me
They wanna come and blaze with me, then fall asleep on top of me
I don't give no fuck bout no hater that's up under me
I'm smoking on my ounces until the weed no longer grow for me

[Outro:]
Push around, push around
(ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
Push around, push around
(ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
Push around, push around
(ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
