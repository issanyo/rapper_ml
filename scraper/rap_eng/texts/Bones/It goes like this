[Verse]
Please donâ€™t ever talk down looking for the runaround
Bones on the case ill solve it
Picking up clues like they picking what I do
Download open up then they login
They try but they never ever prosper
Went to school just to get put in the locker
Until I showed up with the shh just stop it
I ain't gotta load shit to drop you
I said ima leave just watch me
Then I caught a flight straight up out the marshes
Exclamation approach with caution
Its slippery around where we walking
Was cold life waiting in the swampland
But I hopped out run through the bushes
Never thought somebody would be looking
Now they all call me for the booking

And it goes like this, city never ever age
Fuck your label, fuck the trends
Makin' music with my friends

And it goes like this, city never ever age
Fuck your label, fuck the trends
Makin' money with my friends
