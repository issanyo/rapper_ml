[Verse 1]
Blunt guts up in my fingernails, aye
I drop a quarter like a wishing well, aye
High up in the summit I assume it fell, aye
I hate the feeling when the pack is stale, aye
A blunt cracked and a tear fell, aye
Slow-mo 'till it hit the ground, aye
Five woods, only two I can use, aye
Nights like this so Bones gets confused

[Hook]
Need another pack you know I need it right now
Need another pack you know I need it right now
Need another pack
Need another pack right
Cause this one is just no good...

[Outro]
This one is just no good...
