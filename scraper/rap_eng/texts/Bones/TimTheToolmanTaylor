[Verse]
SESH
Razor in my motherfucking trench coat
Timothy the Tool Man Taylor
Never see my face like I live next door
Equipped, one click and I'm ready to swiftly let this vest blow
Better get back when I let it go
Dead man's switch in active mode
Motherfucker talk a lot of shit (ah)
Till I reach through the mist and they flip (ah)
Flee from the scene not a word plead the fifth
You don't see Bones but he see you bitch (ah)
You are not alone, I can feel your breath
Summon me from ash maybe I will let you live
The legend of the underground tell you what it is
To land in the sky leaping out of the abyss

[Hook]
Dying slow, dying slow, eyes low, eyes low
Repeat the phrase I love you until I turn into a ghost
Dying slow, dying slow, eyes low, eyes low
Repeat the phrase I love you until I turn into a ghost

[Post-Hook]
BONES on the block again, now they on the asphalt
Soon as I get to snappin', I don't just pass I overlap y'all
BONES on the block again, now they on the asphalt
Soon as I get to snappin', I don't just pass I overlap y'all
What?
