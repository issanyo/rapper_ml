[Verse 1]

Young Cleopatra
Bitch I'm so flashy
Gold all over like a prince call me Aladdin
See rappin' ain't a habit, I'm in it 'till the casket
My shit go hard and your shit go flaccid
Tragic, face it, your whole sound basic
My shit go bang you can hear it from the basement
Flows so faceman
Change and reshape shit
This ain't a fuckin' rap it's a fuckin' creation
This shit for the base heads
Get high off that basin
Your dude may talk shit, but I know he'll never say shit
Blunt rolled, team here, we on that fuck dave shit
Nightrats, wrap pack, ya they be on that same shit
