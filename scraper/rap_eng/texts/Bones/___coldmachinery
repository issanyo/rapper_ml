[Intro]
"Yes, I regret it. I'm sorry. I think I would have been happier... I'm not very happy now."

[Verse]
I'll give it up for you
Every little thing I do
I'll give it up for you
Every little thing I do
I'll stop it all for you
Every little game we play
I'll drop it all for you
You, you, you, you
I'll stop it all for you
You, you, you, you
I'll drop it all for you
