[Chorus: Chsr]
I want you so bad, even though it still hurts
Holdin' me hostage, using those words
They taste like poison
It's venom in your voice, yeah yeah
I want you so bad even though you no good
Holdin' out hope when I know that I shouldn't
Just like poison
There's venom in your voice, yeah yeah

[Verse: Bones]
Pullin' up, poppin' out all in one motion
I know how you really feel it ain't no notion
I'm hoping you know that I'd kill, for you
Whatever you want that's whatever you need know I will, for you
I never go, forever more
Sometimes I get up and feel alone

[Bridge: Bones]
I know you can wait for eventually
But you don't have to
Fall back I'm the one that'll back you
I'm the one that night looking at you
No matter what I do there's no getting back you

[Chorus: Chsr]
I want you so bad, even though it still hurts
Holdin' me hostage, using those words
They taste like poison
It's venom in your voice, yeah yeah
I want you so bad even though you no good
Holdin' out hope when I know that I shouldn't
Just like poison
There's venom in your voice, yeah yeah
