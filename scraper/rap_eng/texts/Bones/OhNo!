[Verse]
They see that it's Bones and say "oh no"
Robot I flip into overload
Rollin up zone by the boatload
Think you know SESH but you don't (don't)
I don't know nothing about hope (hope)
Always thought I'd get it wrong (wrong)
Never saw this coming quite a predicament
Fuck it I'll take it in stride ain't no breaking it
Eyes closed, windows down, cashed off that dope (dope)
Carbon fiber blood scrape my veins whenever it do flow (flow)
Used to sleep in the snow (snow)
Shaking cold on the floor (floor)
Concrete room I could have died and nobody would have ever known, bitch

[Hook]
When's the last time SESH ever took a break? (break)
"Might take some time, it's been a while"
Okay, I'll wait (wait)
When's the last time SESH ever took a break? (break)
"Might take some time, it's been a while"
Okay, I'll wait (I'll wait)

[Outro]
You don't want no static I bring havoc when we slidin' up
You don't want no static I bring havoc when we slidin' up
You don't want no static
You don't want no static
When we slidin' up
