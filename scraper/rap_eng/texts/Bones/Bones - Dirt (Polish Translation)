[Hook]
You say you've got them guns but I've never seen you bang
You say you've got them drugs but I've never seen you slang
You say you're in the game but I've yet to see you play
You say you're going hard but nobody feels the same
You say you've got them guns but I've never seen you bang
You say you've got them drugs but I've never seen you slang
You say you're in the game but I've yet to see you play
You say you're going hard but nobody feels the same

[Verse]
Swerving off, my eyes closed
Graveyard's where I call home
Razor blade in my fucking palms, touch me and I'mma cut you off
Raindrops on my white skin, turn ghost and I'm in my zone
Hair long, my bluntâ€™s short, always smoke, so we rollin' more
Coming down, coming down, see me, but don't hear a sound
Ridin' 'round, ridin' 'round, "Cemetary Blunts" in the background loud
Now now, burn it all to the ground
To the ground, ground, Bones back in time
I ain't got no fucking chain, I ain't got no diamond ring
Young Justin Timberlake, all these bitches know my name
If you see me out in public then you know I got the blade
If you see me on the stage you know I got the blade
Hundred pills in my pocket but that shit is not for me
I feed 'em to my girl and watch her drop down to her knees
Ghost in my hair, I got ash on my jeans
These women tryna scheme cause I look like Dawson's Creek

[Hook]
You say you've got them guns but I've never seen you bang
You say you've got them drugs but I've never seen you slang
You say you're in the game but I've yet to see you play
You say you're going hard but nobody feels the same
You say you've got them guns but I've never seen you bang
You say you've got them drugs but I've never seen you slang
You say you're in the game but I've yet to see you play
You say you're going hard but nobody feels the same, yeah
