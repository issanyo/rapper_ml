[Intro]
Yeah
Reporting live from the Sewer
Th@ Kid, Rap Pack, SESH

[Verse1]
Hand me down hoodie with a no gold chain on
Feeling like DMC back in A4
Hat turned back, kid pushing on my skateboard
Cream colour sneakers
Life is a cake-walk
Once again backs the incredible
Here to bring the world some noise
So get ready for
My racket, smash it
Put it in the trash can
Other dudes acting
Me I'm just rapping
All these jack-rabbits, thinking I'm in last place
I just broke the ribbon at the finish of this rat race
Your far too kind, Thank you all
A special thanks to my friends who thought they knew it all
Scratch that, I meant to say "old friends"
It's at the point in life to where hope it was just hopeless
Got sick of smoking, got tired of drinking
So I closed my eyes, till I woke to freedom
On the five speeding, shifting gears and spitting frees
Till I got back to LA, and sparked with the team
It's the young hitter, "batter ups" what they screaming
Cause every rap that I kicks is as good as my last hit
