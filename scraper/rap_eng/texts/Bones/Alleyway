[Hook]
I'm smokin' by myself, I'm in the alleyway and I'm bent
See, I'm high off of two blunts
And I'm sippin' on that Cris'
See, I used to be Th@ Kid, now I'm just that pimp
I got tataracs on my back and a switchblade stay stuck to my hip
I'm smokin' by myself, I'm in the alleyway and I'm bent
See, I'm high off of two blunts
And I'm sippin' on that Cris'
See, I used to be Th@ Kid, now I'm just that pimp
I got tataracs on my back and a switchblade stay stuck to my hip


[Verse 1]
Don't make me flip it, boy you trippin'
If you think that I won't flick it
When it comes down to it I'm a nice guy but in the nighttime, I'm wicked
See, when the night falls I'm creepin'
I do it like every weekend
We get high 'til we almost die and do it again next evening
I'm just a skeleton in clothing
I'm just a crypt keeper that's flowing
Got no face, got no name, got no style, I'm nothing
That monster live in yo' closet
That drug money in yo' pocket
That devil up on yo' shoulder saying run up in the spot and pop it

[Hook]
I'm smokin' by myself, I'm in the alleyway and I'm bent
See, I'm high off of two blunts
And I'm sippin' on that Cris'
See, I used to be Th@ Kid, now I'm just that pimp
I got tataracs on my back and a switchblade stay stuck to my hip
I'm smokin' by myself, I'm in the alleyway and I'm bent
See, I'm high off of two blunts
And I'm sippin' on that Cris'
See, I used to be Th@ Kid, now I'm just that pimp
I got tataracs on my back and a switchblade stay stuck to my hip

[Outro]
Yeah
Hundred blunts to the face
Hundred blunts to the neck
Hundred blunts on my mind
I'm with the Team, that Sesh
Yeah
Hundred blunts to the face
Hundred blunts to the neck
Hundred blunts on my mind
I'm with the Team, that Sesh
