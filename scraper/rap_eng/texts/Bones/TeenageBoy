[Intro]
"OK, I just want to warn you that, uh, when I wrote this song...
I was listening to The Cure a lot, so...

[Verse 1]
Waiting till I fade away
It's coming any day
You don't need to come my way
I'm not worth it anyway (worth it anyway)
I don't wanna breathe, I don't wanna breathe
If you're not here with me
I don't wanna breathe, I don't wanna breathe
If you're not here with me

[Hook]
If you're not here, I don't want to be
If you're not here I don't want to...

[Outro]
"He's losing his mind
And I'm reaping all the benefits"
