[Verse: Bones]
Fuck with SESH, that's suicide
Life-life or death, quick you decide
Hit recline, and then I get to rhymin'
Never seen, never heard, just someone like-like me
I'm dying, dying, I'm breathing, roll-rollin' up while I'm thinkin'
I'm feelin' somethin' like JFK but I ain't ridin' around in no Lincoln
My eyes closed and I'm sinkin', sinkin', down to the very bottom
Nev-nev-nev-never had no problems, but if you want one then I'll solve it
It's the teenage corpse, blow-blowin' dope up on the porch
Hoppin out, slammin' doors, never prayin' to a lord
Sippin' pesticides, I'm next to die, blades high- blades high like they exercise
Pesticides, next to die
Blades high like they, blades high like they pesticides
I'm next to die
Blades high like they exercise
Pesticides, next to die
Blades high like they
I'm sippin' pesticides
I'm-I'm-I'm next to die
Blades high like they exercise, I'm next to die
I'm next to, I'm next to die
I'm next to die, I'm next to die
Fuck with SESH, that's suicide
