Walking with Bones, so you already know
Take 'em back home, to the roads that I know
Sleep where you sleep, and you die where you born
Fuck what you know, and fuck what you've been told

Shaved hair running through the snow, boy with the frostbit skull
Now back to tell 'em once more, the young white mac came back with the flow
Never had money or hometown pride
Every night ride, like tonight we die
Town fucked up, so the kids fucked up
Everything cash, from the views to the drugs
Looking at the world only way they know how
Throw away your time til they throw you in the ground
I don't like you I don't like your friends
I hope you never like me, let's not pretend

Looking at the ones at the so called top
Looking at us for the so called props
Try to take sound, but you can't take style
Can't replicate nothing that we done, get around
Move up out the way, kill yourself today
I hope you know the money that you makin' ain't a thing bitch
