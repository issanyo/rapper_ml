[Verse 1]
My head hurt, I need to lie down
Play me too loud I need to pipe down
Lights down, my hair is up
My stare is like, looking into the fire's eyes
Come around my way, you'll be

[Hook]
Burnt to a crisp like that
Before you even get the chance to fight back
I know what you're thinking
"Why so quick to flip it? Bones, now you always tripping"
No, I'm just fucking sick of clones thinking that they kill it

[Verse 2]
Stalactite dripping out your flashlight
Glitching you in flashback transmission
I suppose this is the ending for the story that you call your life
Take the binders, rip the spine, every page is getting burnt
Now every breath you take is mine

[Hook]
Burnt to a crisp like that
Before you even get the chance to fight back
I know what you're thinking
"Why so quick to flip it? Bones, now you always tripping"
No, I'm just fucking sick of clones thinking that they kill it
