[Verse: Bones]
I don't care about what you like to do
Me and the people I'm with, we stay tight when we move
Came up so quick and know that there's no rules
I see it for what it is not what it do
I'm outside the outside, peeping in looking at you
I don't say a word I don't pay no mind, but I know when you move
I feel when you breathe, my head to my feet
The presence of me, is the same as it leaves
Way I drape across the sky, cast a refuge
You're all dogs, seeking shelter and lemme bless you
Cool it down, cool it down, breathing loud, we movin' now
Don't worry 'bout the burns, cause it's all over now
They don't wanna see us bitch, okay I don't blame you
Shit head smokin' shit hash, Chevy's playin'
They don't wanna see us bitch, okay I don't blame you
Shit head smokin' shit hash, Chevy's playin'
Now you mad like an old man stuck doin' the ropedance
Yet to learn that me and coexistences don't hold hands
First a knife fall and then it hit the ground
Pickin' up stars in the grass that they keep crashin' down
Hundred one blunts till my don't eyes work
Still I see it all, some how it's berserk
How the faith light turns quick in with the blur
Call my vision therefore I heard
Hundred one blunts till my don't eyes work
Still I see it all, some how it's berserk
How the faith light turns quick in with the blur
Call my vision therefore I heard
I'm sittin' on a porch smokin' on a blunt
Sittin' on a porch smokin' on a blunt
Sittin' on a porch smokin' on a blunt
