Swishin' the game
Grippin' the grain
Takin' the picture and flippin' the frame
Blunts to the the face that's every day
Love it so much i might marry the Jane
Now fuck that, that's corny shit, but it rhyme right so i said it bitch
I'm chillin' bitch on my lavish shit, you ain't no where close to my level bitch
Big minerals on my [?] bitch
Fresh fruit, flood my plate
Stay out my rays like a freckle bitch
Cuz you are my son and i am your maker
Ridin' scrapers, out in Vegas on the old strip goin' 88
Too many drugs i think i'm bouta faint, but we got too many rolled i ain't waitin'
I ain't bout praying
I ain't bout makin' up gods in my head to help me get through the day
I ain't bout the rain I ain't bout the pain
I kick hella raps and smoke hella weed
That's just me, that's just SESH
18 and i get better like every day of my fuckin' life
I got a million in my hand and it's bouta take flight like
