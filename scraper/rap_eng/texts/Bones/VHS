[Intro]

[Hook x2: Na$ty Matt]
My mind got me missing, this static got me tripping
VHS camera in the closet caught these hoes slipping
I'm limited edition, minus intuition, minus the ambition
Lack of my soul causing emission

[Verse 1: Na$ty Matt]
Young dirt bag, everybody knows
Got a pocket full of hope and a snub nose
I'mma take you back, to like 06'
Spitfire hoodies flip tricks and hitting licks
Fired up the blacks spitting game to the chips
Live up in the moment, and never give a shit
Present day, 21 years old, mouth full of gold
Almost as cold, as my fucking soul
I know I ain't living right but I ain't living wrong
Her body super tight kitty poking out the thong
Gods in the flesh, gold chains on our chests
Team sesh till death till they put my ass to rest

[Hook x2: Na$ty Matt]
My mind got me missing, this static got me tripping
VHS camera in the closet caught these hoes slipping
I'm limited edition, minus intuition, minus the ambition
Lack of my soul causing emission

[Verse 2: Bones]
It's the young white witch I was raised in the sticks
Tattered clothes on my bones blood dripping from my wrists
In the woods smoking woods, I ain't posted in the hood
Bitch I'm in the haunted house with the ghosts and the ghouls Every song is a ritual, every blunt is habitual
VHS with my visuals, you a fake I'm original
Rusty hinges on the doors, stone on the walls
Leave your body in the cellar leave your blood in the halls
Breathe, bitch take a deep breath
It's the teenage skeleton flowing it till I'm dead
I said breathe, bitch take a deep breath
See my blade don't say a word but my grave says sesh

[Hook x2: Na$ty Matt]
My mind got me missing, this static got me tripping
VHS camera in the closet caught these hoes slipping
I'm limited edition, minus intuition, minus the ambition
Lack of my soul causing emission
