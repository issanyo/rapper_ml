[Intro]
Sesh
How are you today?
(I'm fine. I'm weird actually. I'm disoriented. I'm not sure where I am. I mean, I know where I am, but it feels odd being here. I'm ok.)

[Verse 1: Bones]
I’ve crossed the T’s
Now I dot the I’s
I’ve lost my mind
And I’ve crossed the line
Now everything I do
Revolves around you
Way your life reflects back in my eyes
I would never not feel that
I know I’ve done things I can’t take back
I hope you know that I’ve never grown cold
Even when death comes im holding you close
The look on your face and I know that you know
Wow

[Hook: Dylan Ross]
Stay here beside me
You couldn’t do a single thing to surprise me
With me
Or by me
Crawling all over your body just like ivy

(How long have you been in love with her?)
(Who said anything about love?)

[Verse 2: Dylan Ross]
I can feel you in the Forrest
I can feel you in the trees
I can feel you in the breeze
I can feel you when I breathe
I am sinking oh so deep
I can not think
I can not sleep
All I think about is you and how you are not here with me
The rain is coming down and caving in my house of leaves
I might tell you how you how i feel just when you are about to leave
The way I feel about you
I don’t think you could perceive
How I love you like a lover with no love inside of me
I don’t think I’ll ever really get the way it goes and all I know is what I want and what I need and what I should
To make you see that I am broken but I’m open to the golden skies
Above and hoping serendipity drown in the ocean
If I had anything about you other than a premonition then I would let it lead me to my death or another decision
Wishing that I had you right next to me with the passion crawling all over you like the ivy growing on the mansion
