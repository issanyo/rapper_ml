Pullin' up feet hangin' out the window
Tippin' four fours bout to blow like Nintendos
Only but my own shit so i ride real slow
Time to go hard so i'm breakin' out the steel tones
Females love me they put nothin' above me
Call me room heaven cuz it's where i feel godly
Fuck your Bugatti I pull up on a bike, blunt hangin' out my mouth speed and pass you at the light
Like Jesus Christ how we get so high, bloodshot eyes hardly open while i ride just a weird white kid that gets way too high and approaches microphones just to speak in rhymes
Like testing, 1, 2 am i coming through?
Swangin' lane to lane sippin' on that screw juice
Never fuckin' gonna shoot, never gonna kill, never fuckin' gonna stop, never fuckin' gonna chill
Only gonna fuckin' stack my paper on top of that
All I wanna do is rap, so i'm fuckin' doin' that
Dreamt a dream when i was 6, so i'm fuckin' chasin' that
Tool bus, hundred blunts, 30 ounces in the back
Degeneration SESH, throw a sucker then we jet
