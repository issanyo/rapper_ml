[Intro - Koopsta Knicca]
Purple thang, gold hammers
Gleamin' as I see you pass
Purple thang, gold hammers
Gleamin' as I see you pass
Purple thang, gold hammers
Gleamin' as I see you pass
Purple thang, gold hammers
Gleamin' as I see you pass
Purple thang, gold hammers
Gleamin' as I see you pass
Purple thang, gold hammers
Gleamin' as I see you pass
Purple thang, purple thang
Purple thang, purple thang
Purple thang, purple thang
Purple thang, purple thang
Purple thang, purple thang
Purple thang, purple thang
Purple thang, purple thang

[Verse - Bones]
Picture me bout it
Picture me ballin
Like I'm back in Oakland
And them Daytons pokin'
You know i'm swangin'
That trunk bangin'
The Bones playin, I'm fuckin' sayin'  I'm layin' low
Key for the moment, I ain't no shit
I ain't see no gunshots, i ain't load no clip
In the night, creepin', peepin' out my blinds
Will I live to see another sunrise, or will I die
I don't know
