[Verse 1: Th@ Kid]
Welcome to my world
Can take a look around
But wipe your feet before you step up inside this house
They say if you've seen one you've seen 'em all
But if you haven't heard of me you ain't heard nothin' at all (No)
I've got people who still hate me
Havin' nightmares of me makin' it
While awakin' to my daydream, so wake up
To everybody who sleepin'
You try to hit the snooze button but it won't stop a beepin'
Oh my, look how time is flyin' I just [? 0:42] with diamonds, I'm in
Another timezone, smokin' that time bomb, that C4 tree
You ain't on what I'm on
(No) I find myself in the studio
Take some kush to the head and now I'm lost boy like Rufio
I let the truth be told, man I don't run from it
I just chase my dreams in a marathon, it's all or nothin'

[Verse 2: Uncredited Rapper]
I got a dude named Vince Vaughn
All he do is break up
I smoke [? 1:26] (I smoke [? 1:28])
All I remember is when I wake up
I got a girl who gets it free (gets it free)
Edible for kush weed
I know a guy in the D
That gives us tree and LSD
You won't believe what you see
Pink line, purple weed
Black sky, white bank
I'm doin' what you said I couldn't, what you think?
I'm super cali, fragilistc
Twist it off [? 2:05]
Don't believe in matchin', now I'm true
Smoke [? 2:10], while I roll this
Five hundred dollars
For your fuckin' volcano
I dont give a fuck
I roll [? 2:26]
