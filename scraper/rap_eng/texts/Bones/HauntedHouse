[Verse 1]
High as fuck, comin' down but I'm rollin' up
Haunted house, haunted blunts
Blowin' ghosts when I'm dopin' up
Three knocks, open up
Spider webs cover everything
100 woods that ain't enough
She rollin' drugs till her fingers bleed
Pass her way she pass away
Flick ash and she pass a flame
Overdose and I'm the one the blame
Young Bones she know my name
All alone, all alone, close my eyes and then I'm in my zone
Dyin' slow, dyin' slow, ring the bell but ain't no one home

[Hook]
Haunted house, step inside
Welcome to my world
Dead girls on the floor, more in my room
Haunted house, step inside
Welcome to my life
Just the young dead boy with a knife
