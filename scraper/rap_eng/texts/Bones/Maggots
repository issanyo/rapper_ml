[Verse 1]
Maggots crawling out my ribcage like a trashcan
Smoke leaking out me while I dope, know when I'm cashed damn
Hair tied up, I'm matchin', see piss, my shit hit like Agassi
You make it roll when I do shows, make racket now you mad at me
Acting so up status like that rocket on your back and chest
I will snap right back and rubber band your bank, no charging dip
I pull every card 'til you dissolve and you return to deck
I disarm your arms like when subzero showed up on the ship
Shoulder lean, young dro, never never too much blunt smoke
Jigging-Jigging to our own shit, motherfuck whoever I don't know
Shoulder lean, young dro, never never too much blunt smoke
Jigging-Jigging to our own shit, motherfuck whoever I don't know

[Hook]
We came in starving so yeah now we eating
Forever hungry say fuck, forever feasting
Fuck what your team say, you ain't the meanest
You ain't the rawest and sure ain't the cleanest
Bitch I step up feeling just like Meryl Streep
I defend my life and protect those around me 'til I sleep
