(...the switchblade out. –that shit back. Roll up another one of those. WHAT. Look at that fucking ash-WHAT-tray though. WHAT. Sigh. It got loud. Hold on. YEAH. WHAT.)

Windows down, rolling up, whole team in the truck
Sun down, bass up, lungs full of fucking blunts
I’m gin sipping, on Tanqueray wishing
I’m throwing pennies in the fountain, mind drifting
Yeah, my mind different. Yeah, the time slipping
I tried to hold on, but my grip keep missing
One day I’m 15, next day I’m 45
In the blink of an eye, I just watched my life fly by
My seat back, recline, hair hanging out the window
Shit, soundtrack to my life, Team SESH banging bitch
Smoke pouring out the ride float, dose when we slide slow
Driving through the night, just thinking ‘bout life, like
“How long do I get before I’ve got to leave this place?”
“I got drugs in my blunt, and I ain’t 'bout to let them wait.”
I flick the light, now I’m higher
Than I ever been. She dying
She OD and she’s screaming
She too gone, she leaving

(Yeah, yeah. Bones. SESH. Yeah.)
