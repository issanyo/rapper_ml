[Intro]
Now let's begin
Close your eyes
And take a long, slow, easy breathe
In through your nose
Hold it briefly
Then let it go
Allowing your thoughts come to rest
There is nothing you need to do right now
This is your time to quiet your mind

[Verse:]
Baby, you don't know where I've been and I'm feeling it
Baby, you know more than me, and I'm [?] it

[Hook]
Show me another way
Show me another way
Show me another way
Show me another way
Show me another way
Show me another way

[Outro]
[?] living through
Happens [?] living through
[?] every [?]
