[Verse: Chris Travis]
Don't leave too soon, we in my room
What you wanna do, sex in my tomb
Hit the lights out, baby, take it all off, baby
Don't be afraid, baby, I ain't been the same lately
Don't leave too soon, we in my room
What you wanna do, sex in my tomb
Hit the lights out, baby, take it all off, baby
Don't be afraid, baby, I ain't been the same lately

[Verse: Bones]
Smoked out in my Impala, countin' dolla after dolla
Since the money come and go, let it rain like a shower
You get paid by the hour, I get paid by the thousands
I got money in my hand and I'm 'bout to make it rain

[Hook: Bones & Chris Travis]
Don't leave too soon, don't leave too soon (Don't leave too soon)
Bass bangin' out the trunk while I'm rollin' up a blunt
Don't leave too soon, don't leave too soon (Don't leave too soon)
Bitch I do just what I want, give a fuck 'bout what you think
Don't leave too soon, we in my room
What you wanna do, sex in my tomb
Hit it all out, baby, take it all off, baby
I ain't been the same lately

[Verse: Bones]
Smoked out in my Impala, countin' dolla after dolla
Since the money come and go, let it rain like a shower
You get paid by the hour, I get paid by the thousands
I got money in my hand and I'm 'bout to make it rain

[Hook: Bones & Chris Travis]
Don't leave too soon, don't leave too soon (Don't leave too soon)
Bass bangin' out the trunk while I'm rollin' up a blunt
Don't leave too soon, don't leave too soon (Don't leave too soon)
Bitch I do just what I want, give a fuck 'bout what you think
Don't leave too soon, we in my room
What you wanna do, sex in my tomb
Hit it all out, baby, take it all off, baby
I ain't been the same lately
