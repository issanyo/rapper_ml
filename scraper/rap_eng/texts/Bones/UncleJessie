[Intro]
I feel like uncle Jesse
I feel like uncle Jesse

[Verse]
I feel like uncle Jesse all these bitches tryna get me
I feel like uncle Jesse when I'm smoking with my bitch
I'm Flippin back my hair she got a man and she bout to ditch
Young Stamos so you know my house is full
Ten bedrooms all stuffed full of hoes
Gold on the door, platinum on my ring
Women say they like me they just like how I do my thing
They see just where I be, they see just where I stay
They tryna fuck with me so they can fuck me all damn day
I feel like uncle Jesse your girl tryna undress me
But imma keep my clothes on and smoke
I feel like uncle Jesse you look like Danny Tanner
My bitch look like Rebecca
Your bitch look like Kimmy Gibbler
