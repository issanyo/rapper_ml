[Verse: Bones]
French terry cloth hangin' off me swingin'
Gritty drugs, soft clothes, everything knitted
Rigid brass, patch the holes, now the bitch hidden
I'm way to far ahead, I'ma start again before they finish
I think I passed the limit for they so called physics
Thinkin' I couldn't pass a point that I've been passed for a minute
I could show you the way, or I could throw you away
Teach ya life and pass away and forever sleep in the bass

[Chorus]
Stepping up out my comfort zone
(Im stepping out)
Just to show you that you can't go wrong
(Im leaving now)
Tell me about it, things gotta be strong
(Im stepping out)
Yell but nobody knew where you are
I'll spend eternity waiting for you if you ain't ready to talk
I can wait it out
I'll spend eternity waiting for you if you ain't ready to talk
I can wait it out
