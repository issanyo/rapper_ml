My mind's a weapon
My mouth is too
My flow is semi-automatic on wax so rude
I, I get in the zone
Then I make it happen
Just a kid with a passion for rapping
I get in the zone, then I make it happen
Young kid with a knack for rapping
I put it down
For the team that's sesh [?]
Green inbetween my keys, black heart in my chest
I'm a young man with no remarks for women
Tell them if they got a plan pack your bags run with it
I gotta let you know something about me
I scream fuck the world loud with [?]
I sag my pants and flip my cap backwards
Feeling like kid rock rocking like Fred Durst
I am the trouble maker you've been waiting for
My plan is bringing down all these non-originals
So, go dim the lights down draw the curtians [?]
Let them know we working now
I'mma gut another blunt and blast another beat
And proceed to be the rapper I wanna be
Used to rap sweet sixteens when I was sixteen
Now I rap [?] on beats for free
See, I ain't made a penny yet, let alone a living
So I'm living at my brother's and my parents' on the weekends
Bless their souls, see they know what's coming
A couple mixtapes away from crowds chanting and jumping
I can see it now Th@ Kid surfing crowds
Cowabunga at the top my lungs, look at me now
It's the young teenage mutant ninja turtle
In the sewer with your women, got them moaning like [?]
Wait, wait
Let it soak for a second, I'm seventeen rapping like an old hiphop legend
[?]
All this buzz got me lifted killing all the statistics
Dropped out moved away started rapping
Now it's to move to the top, faster than all these graduates
I'm hazardous contaminated [?]
With battery acid for every priest and every [?]
I fucking hate religion bad enough to make a laugh of it
I spot a lower case T on your chain, you must be out of it
Flow like alchemist, elemental power shit
Shape shifted to a throne just to watch them bow to me
I am the [?], that mean you can't take a corner without me knowing
Yo, so
Go dim the lights down, draw the curtians
Let them know we working now
I'mma gut another blunt then blast another beat
And proceed to be the rapper I wanna be
Yeah
