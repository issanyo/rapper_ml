[Hook]
If you go, please come back
I don’t know, how to act
When you’re not here with me
I go crazy,  I lose my head, I can’t sleep
When you’re not here with me
I hope you see, I need you in my sheets
If you go, please come back
I don’t know, how to act
When you’re not here with me
I go crazy,  I lose my head, I can’t sleep
When you’re not here with me
I hope you see, I need you in my sheets
