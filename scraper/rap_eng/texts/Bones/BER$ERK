The bass knockin', bitch open up
Go pour a cup, if you smoke, roll a blunt
Brand new ounce, young and full of drugs
Still not giving it up, still not giving a fuck
I couldn't stop rappin' if i fuckin' tried to
They say this shit was sick bitch, trust me you're being lied to
Mountain full of ash that's too [?]
Your shit may be awesome but my shit's fuckin' colossal
My shits underground my genre should just be fossil
TeamSesh, fuck Dave, yep that's the motto
Came through ice around my neck young gelato
Remember when my teacher said I wouldn't make it far though
Now I don't leave my house without one of my chains on though
Only spend a thousand if i need to let the trunk blow
Rappin' all day smoking weed in my condo
Me and my fuckin' team killin' beats till the sun go down
And even when it do we still love guttin' blunts
Don't worry it's what we do
One ounce, one day, 30 raps to the face, new high, new fade, new money to fuckin' make
300 something songs, 19 fuckin' mixtapes
Your whole catalogue of music's a mistake
Your shit's so fifth place, mine's so first
Been rhyming since the cradle, imma rhyme until the hearse, I murk
Ever verse I blurt, kids so dope, flow so berserk
