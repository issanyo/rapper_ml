[Intro]
BONES

[Verse]
SESH forever on the rise
Let the moon be my guide
Staring at the sky while I navigate
My way through the divide I find
I have learned that nothing's pre-determined
Truthfully I speak the sermon
Stand behind this world observing
Watch you watch them while they burn it

[Hook]
I am nothing but a corpse to you
I am nothing but a corpse to you
I could never change that
I can never change back
I could never change that
I can never change back
(What, what, what, wait)

[Outro]
I know, I know, I know, I know it, no need to tell me
I know, I know, I know, I know it, no need to tell me
I know, I know, I know, I know it, no need to tell me
I know, I know, I know, I know it, no need to tell me
