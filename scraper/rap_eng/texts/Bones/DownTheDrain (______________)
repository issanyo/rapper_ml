[Intro]
RYZE

[Verse 1]
Droppin out the town that most ain't ever heard about
Poppin out, they turning heads, I guess they hear me now
I'm a legend, underground treasure, someone to learn about
Kill at my leisure, pick up and dead 'em
I almost concern myself (what)
Never was one for the wealth (wealth)
Give me some blunts and my health (health)
If I can't have both, I'm choosing death
Tell me, what the fuck's a law
When you within castle walls
I get fruit, water, dope, woods to wrap 'em with one call

[Chorus]
Lay me down, come and make my day
I've been waiting since yesterday
Patiently, I have suppressed the rage
Spend my whole life going down the drain
Lay me down, come and make my day
I've been waiting since yesterday
Patiently, I have suppressed the rage
Spend my whole life going down the drain

[Outro]
What?
Big Ern McCracken, lose your hand if you reachin' (reachin')
Get you Munson'd on sight, I don't need a reason (reason)
Think you had a hard night, wait until I see you (wait)
Escanaba in the moonlight with that heater (what)
Warmer, warmer, warmer, warmer, warmer, I make 'em warmer
Warmer, warmer, warmer, warmer, warmer, I make 'em warmer (stop)
