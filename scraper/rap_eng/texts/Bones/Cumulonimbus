[Verse: Bones]
Water dripping from the leaves
Rolling up all my weed, winds ripping through the trees
Rain dropping from the sky
Memories on my mind, chills slithering up my spine
Doping while I'm smoking and I'm flowing while I'm rolling
Xay told me tell 'em so I told him

[Hook: Bones]
Rain coming down, puddles on the ground
Rolling in the street lights, windows down
Rain coming down, puddles on the ground
Rolling in the street lights, windows down

[Bridge: Bones]
Rain, rain, go away, come again another day
Rain, rain, go away, come again another day
Rain, rain, go away, come again another day
Rain, rain, go away, come again another day

[Hook: Bones]
Rain coming down, puddles on the ground
Rolling in the street lights, windows down
Rain coming down, puddles on the ground
Rolling in the street lights, windows down
