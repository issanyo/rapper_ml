SESH

[Chorus: Bones & Danny Brown]
Give me the light, dope rolled up tight
Like some under armor (stop!)
Give me the light, dope rolled up tight
Like some under armor (stop!)
Give me the light, dope rolled up tight
Like some under armor (armor)
Give me the light, dope rolled up tight
Like some under armor (armor)

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Check!
Playing with my nose froze up the center lost it (stop!)
Nigga say that coca-cola like a soul controller (ah)
Hit a couple lines and I told my nigga roll-up
Left some blood on my Rollie when I went and wiped my nose up
It's a cold, cold world, (ah) gotta stay frosty (ah)
Kinda hard for me to keep these urges up off me (ah)
Demons on my back and they won't get off me (stop!)
I escape, but in the end, it always costs me (stop!)
God, I think I lost (lost!)
Don't even know (know)
Scared what I'ma do so I don't go out in public (nah)
I be like fuck (fuck)
Nigga got some hoes up (ah)
Glass skins skis so we all get froze up (yeah)
Never get enough (nuff)
Can somebody help me
Think I've fallen and I can't get up
Never get enough (nuff) even though it ain't right (right)
In these dark times just gimme that light (go!)

[Chorus: Bones]
Give me the light, dope rolled up tight
Like some under armor (armor)
Give me the light, dope rolled up tight
Like some under armor (what? armor)
Give me the light, dope rolled up tight
Like some under armor (armor)
Give me the light, dope rolled up tight
Like some under armor (armor)

[Verse 2: Bones]
Blade in my coat (coat), I don't need a scope (go)
Shadow in the snow (no), yep, that's Bones (Bones)
Never had hope, no, that's just known (known)
Came from the place where the kids get smoked (smoked)
Bitch you could talk just don't double cross me (ah)
Catch you after eight like Great Lakes Crossing
Buck knife on me, do a little carving
For my next trick, you appear in the coffin
Render you worthless, life isn't perfect (ah)
You don't deserve it, I flip and invert ya (yeah)
I be that one, yeah the Witch that done cursed ya (yeah)
Prefer it permanent, forever hurting (uh)
Cast me a spell vanish behind the curtains (yeah)
Take on the physical form of exertion (yeah)
Remember the day that we robbed the excursion (yeah)
Easy to break in when friends are encouraging (ah)
Needed deliverance, got us some cash (yeah)
Woke up with rats fell asleep in the trash (yeah)
I shut my eyes and try to go back (ah)
Nah I'm too cashed, can you riddle me that?

[Bridge: Bones]
Sean Paul was never there to gimme the light
He was too busy getting his temperature right (ah)
Sean Paul was never there to gimme the light
He was too busy getting his temperature right
Sean Paul was never there to gimme the light (yeah)
He was too busy getting his temperature right
Sean Paul was never there to gimme the light (what?)
He was too busy getting his temperature right (what?)

[Chorus: Bones]
Give me the light, dope rolled up tight
Like some under armor (armor)
Give me the light, dope rolled up tight
Like some under armor (armor)
Give me the light, dope rolled up tight
Like some under armor (armor)
Give me the light, dope rolled up tight
Like some under armor (armor)
