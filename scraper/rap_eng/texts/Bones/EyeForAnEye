[Verse 1 : Bones]
Who do it every day? Bones
You are so not in my league, no
I bring it back for the team, oh
Every time that I leave home
Bring that 400 degrees, die then cryogenically freeze
To them, it's the same, but it's different to me
My pattern of breath is like waves in the sea
If they ever leave I promise you would see
The things you don't notice are things that you need
There's not too much things that get to me
Other than light when it leak through the trees
One look into my eyes will not peek into me
Need more than your vision to feel what I be
Quick to yell action know SESH make a scene
If you need an edit I will cut you then leave

[Hook: Bones]
Got you some money now, got you a manager, but you still ain't shit
Think that the tables have turned for you but bitch, you still ain't this
Nothing of substance, speak about nothing
I get on shit and I run it like Runyon
TeamSESH scum come straight from the dungeon
No matter where you go hear my voice "stop running"
