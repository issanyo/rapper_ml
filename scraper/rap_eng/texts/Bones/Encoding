[Verse]
Hard drive loaded up, blunts double encoded, what
Zip up all your dreams, compress and right click, watch me open up
I'm the undetected, unprotected glitch up in the system
Fry your shit, you buy your shit, I probably got mine sent to me
Quick to call up infantry, see, I come from a different tree
Matter fact, whole different land, I press you to the nth degree
Best stop, looking for me, got to bump that f-stop
Hailing from a land where shadows come with barrels that steady pop

[Hook]
Ride motherfucker vroom vroom slide motherfucker zoom zoom
Ride motherfucker vroom vroom slide motherfucker zoom zoom
Ride motherfucker vroom vroom slide motherfucker zoom zoom
Ride motherfucker vroom vroom slide motherfucker zoom zoom (What?)
