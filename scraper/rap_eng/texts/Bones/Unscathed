[Verse 1: Xavier Wulf]
You see me in my Uryu coat walking
You might be speaking but I don't hear no talking
The bar girl ask do I come here often
I said naw, then I told her get up off me
I drink chocolate milk, y'all can have some coffee
I got my blade on my back as a option
I'm gettin' tired of putting rappers in these coffins
Who spend all day writing verses for they bosses
I don't think about that shit, I just be talking
Hollow Squad breaking down they whole office
We do not know how to spell cautious
The industry paranoid cause we comin'
14th Squad smokin' weed often
I light a blunt and let it burn while I'm talkin'
Hands up, bitch, FÃ¼hrer woe walkin'
I got my fleet in the fog and the darkness, bitch

[Hook: Bones]
I don't need a co-sign, bitch I'm fine
Smoking since 7, counting money since 9
Every time I die, the planets they align
Every time I ride in the backseat high
I don't need a co-sign, bitch I'm fine
Smoking since 7, counting money since 9
Every time I die, the planets they align
Every time I ride in the backseat high
