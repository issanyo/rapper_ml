[Intro]

Welcome to the SESH Lounge
Give it up for your first act, Bones

[Verse]

I need it bad like a sickness with no remedy
I'm lookin' rich so they actin' like a friend of me
I ask once and they say there's no offending me
Tell 'em keep the two cents cuz they ain't gettin' shit from me
Around the globe twice with the sings of flow
Deltron 3030 blast in my home
New ones on the stove no milk in the fridge, gotta get this money and I gotta get it quick
I'm so much better, cold in any weather
30 below zero no shirt no sweater
Onto the shit they'll be on in 10 years
5 beats 5 mics 10 murders 10 tears
I drop one whenever they pop guns
Hoods already shot no need for shotguns

[Hook]

Trey full of blunts, glass full of gin, pool full of Alize if you tryna swim
Trey full of blunts, glass full of gin, pool full of Alize if you tryna swim
Trey full of blunts, glass full of gin, pool full of Alize if you tryna swim
