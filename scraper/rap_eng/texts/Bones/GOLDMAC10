[Intro]

McDonald's is really good for olympic swimmers
Yo

[Verse 1]

I've got a gold MAC-10 with some platinum bullets
Double dog dare trigger don't you dare me to pull it
Get the dogs to woof it
Get the team to hoof it
Get back to the cadillac parked behind the bushes
Got the mind of a killer with the plot I ain't a rookie
Put you in the cemetery so they don't smell the body
I been rowdy since the beginning, bitch i'm bout it if you bout it
If you ridin' then I'm ridin', if you shootin' then I follow
Eight rounds of them hollows
Water by the bottle
Got some drugs in the refrigerator chillin' till we on them
Trippin' and we fallin' like somebody tied our laces
High as fuck on the drugs, I know I probably shouldn't have laced it
Now I'm faced to fucking face with, the blunt that I been facin'
I take it to the face, that's what the fuck I call a face lift

[Bridge]

Bass in the basement, weed in the garage, crack in the attic, meth in the trailer park
I'ma do it how I want, I'ma make this fuckin' guap
I'ma slang these fuckin' tapes, I'ma drop my fuckin' top
I'ma pop my fuckin' trunk, I'ma fuckin' ride it out
No roof on the whip screamin' fuck the world loud (loud)

[Hook]

Fuck the world loud (loud)
Fuck the world loud
No roof on the whip screamin' fuck the world loud (loud)
Fuck the world loud (loud)
Fuck the world loud (loud)
Fuck the world
Fuck the world
Fuck the world loud (loud, loud)
