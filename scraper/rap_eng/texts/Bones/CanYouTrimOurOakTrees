[Verse]
Speaking up on the team, it's okay, bitch, keep talking
We don't hear no words; couldn't tune in if we wanted
Balance our love you feel me
Infuse inside of my body
SESH boys pullin up quickly, don't you become the target
If it ain't one of my brothers, I don't wanna hear it
If I ever hear you speaking down, then you should fear me
Ten years in the trash, bitch, I don't think you hear me
Rusty needles in the road, black mold on the ceiling
Bitch, no don't get near me, cause I been fucking had it now
Was fucking cashed, then still fucking cashed now
While you cash out, clothing with the tags out
Me, I'm in the dark speaking with death until I pass out

[Hook]
Just some young boys getting into our dreams
Just some young boys they all wanna be now
Just some young boys getting into our dreams
Just some young boys they all wanna be now
