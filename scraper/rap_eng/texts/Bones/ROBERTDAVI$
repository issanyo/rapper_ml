[Verse 1: Bones]
Robert Davis, in my system
I turn it up and then I can feel him
Robert Davis, in my switcher
I take a hit and I can feel it
Never goin' down, always comin' up
And Don't ask what's up cuz I get what's up
Don't ask what's good, the answers me
And don't ask who I'm with, I'm with the team
I'm guttin' blunts, I'm cuttin' trees
Young lumberjack with the rolled up sleeves
Rolled up jeans blowin' rolled up leaves
Ashin' out the window to the cold cut breeze
Cold cut team with the cold cut dream
NIP till I RIP
Please, believe me, I been killin' these beats and bury them in a burial underneath the streets
Under my [?] in the bleachers I never see ya waitin' near the rejack
When we went outlaw, like road dog, and we were bad boys like DX
Throw an XD and then suck it
See we don't give a fuck we say fuck it
Fuck that and fuck Dave get ripped away but get out the way

[Verse 2- Grandmilly]
Robert Davis, Robert Davis, DJ Screw up in my playlist
Killin most of you niggas that say this
[?] Glock in my [?]
Stop the phone got reprimanded
These rowdy niggas got weapons with em
That's birdy stoops my ravin' nigga
[?]
Stylish rag on my belt buckle, niggas talk tough but they felt knuckles
Rollin this dope while she cock back the [?]
[?] lookin' for demons
[?] niggas get high listenin' to Pimp C
[?] niggas ain't knowin a god damn thing
[?] bustin' your brains
What's up, pimpin' these hoes
Don't mess with Texas they tell you before
Smokin' this low, tippin' the foes
[?]
