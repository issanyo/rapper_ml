[Hook]
Say that you counting and cooking up
Bitch you just fraudulent, fucking up
Talkin about checks like you run em up
But you not the one, you the runner up
Say that you counting and cooking up
Bitch you just fraudulent, fucking up
Talkin about checks like you run em up
But you not the one, you the runner up

[Verse]
Quit with the talking, I will close the thread and end the discussion
Loaded up no buffering, I can play offline, I don't need connections
Go count your blessings, you don't get somewhere just because you wanna get there
Dreams don't get granted
Prayers don't get answered
It ain't no question if I got wraps, you know I'mma roll em
Always too cashed to ever get mad, come on, get to know me
It ain't no question if I got wraps, you know I'mma roll em
Always too cashed to ever get mad, come on, get to know me
