[Verse 1]
You're hard not to notice oh lend me your focus
I've never seen eyes like yours
I want to go inside them climb up high and dive in
I've never felt love like yours
You got what I want, every tick of the tock
I got what you need, every night of the week
You got what I want, every tick of the tock
I got what you need, every night of the week

[Hook]
You know I want you
I want you every night of the week
Fingers through your hair
Oh it feels so right, don't you leave me tonight
