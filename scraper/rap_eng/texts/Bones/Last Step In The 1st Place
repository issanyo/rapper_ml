[Intro]
Abso-lutely

[Verse 1: Bones]
Light the do', then we the start the show
Light the road, I don't think I can go
Let them see me, and let them know
That we can make it dark, so watch your flow
Noise let me flow, boys'll let you know
We don't believe you, any of the shit you talk
You just a sad boy, I pity you the most
Stood at night for hoe, but it ain't rappin' though
Got some money, got to switch it, put the rack up
Like a tragedy, biggest let-down
Walking travesty, cash from my head down

[Verse 2: Xavier Wulf]
From pullin' up to pull off, I give no fuck about cost
I don't know what you want and I don't know what I want
I pull off in my tears, I can't even see my gears
I don't know what you want, just know I'm not what you want
I'm pullin' up on her lawn, I give no fuck about cost
I pull up to pull off, I pull up to pull off
I know I'm not what you want and I don't know what I want
Just know I'm not what you want, girl, I'm not what you want
I'm smokin' blunts in the tundra, I pull off while I wander
I do well over 100, I doze off in my dungeon
She feel like I'm the one, I said, "Don't be a dummy"
I care just like she do, that's why I made her get off me
