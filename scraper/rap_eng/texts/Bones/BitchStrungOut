[Verse]
Fill up my cup
Roll up my blunt
She 'bout to OD
I feed her more drugs
She 'bout to black out
I tell her pop this
She say she too high
I say she ain't shit
She say she need help
I say she need this
Roll up a blunt and then light up a flick
Lit the end and pass the back shit
She take a hit
I take a breath
That bitch strung out
That bitch almost dead

[Chorus]
That bitch strung out
That bitch almost dead
She say she need some help
I say I need some head
That bitch strung out
That bitch almost dead
She say she need some help
I say I need some head
