[Verse]
Every night I hear a sound
When it rains I hear it loud
Flying high above the ground
I dont ever wanna go down
Everytime I say your name
I feel a rush in my veins
Everytime I say I love you
I feel like you're the only person that I really know
I wish that we could go
To a place back years
I wish that I could show
Thats how I feel about you
