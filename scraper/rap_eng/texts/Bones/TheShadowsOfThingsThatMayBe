[Hook]
The fall
I don't know if I will live
The fall
I don't know if I will live
It's all
It's all just a bunch of shit
It's all
It's all just a bunch of shit

[Verse]
I'm falling away
I'm falling away from this world
I'm falling away
I'm falling away from this world
Been crawling away
Been crawling away from this world

[Outro]
Ride along far away
Hope I don't fall away
Hope I don't fall away
Ride along far away
