[Intro]
I eat money for breakfast, I eat money for brunch
I eat... fucking million dollars for dinner
One billion dollars for the late night, midnight snack
Get your fucking money up, I’m eating money all goddamn day long

[Hook]
Get your money up, bitch, get your money up
Get your money up, bitch, get your money up
Get your money up, bitch, get your money up
2-stepping in this bitch like a young DJ Unk
Get your money up, bitch, get your money up
Get your money up, bitch, get your money up
Get your money up, bitch, get your money up
2-stepping in this bitch like a young DJ Unk

[Verse]
Broke boy, fuck boy
Running, better duck boy
This is why I’m hot, I feel like MIMS in the cut boy
Posted with them Kut Boyz, weapons on the bust boy
Take your money, take your clothes
Take your fucking lunch, boy
I ain’t nothing nice so don’t step up with that stuff, boy
Acting like a tough boy, you get your body dumped, boy
Somewhere with them thugs boy, rolling up some blunts, boy
If I don’t get to smoke, better believe I’ll fuck you up, boy
Run and get your guns, boy, run and tell your friends, too
Hop up in the car and come and show me what them hammers do
Click clack, get back, pop it like a Tic Tac
Never catch me rocking Jordans, motherfuck a snapback

[Hook]
Get your money up, bitch, get your money up
Get your money up, bitch, get your money up
Get your money up, bitch, get your money up
2-stepping in this bitch like a young DJ Unk
Get your money up, bitch, get your money up
Get your money up, bitch, get your money up
Get your money up, bitch, get your money up
2-stepping in this bitch like a young DJ Unk
