[Hook]
There's just not enough time in the day
Not enough for me to say what I wanna say
There's just not enough time in the day
24 hours never been enough for me anyway

[Verse 1]
There's not enough hours from the AM to PM
Gotta get what I need quick and dip bam
It's like this and like that and like this
I'm cruisin' down the strip with a razor in my fist
I'm crawlin' up on 5th, sittin' on chrome rims
Spokes is pokin', pimp is focused
Money ain't foldin', on silent, don't call me
Get the dial tone in real life when you approach me
The flow is just a habit, I'm spazzin' until I wrap it up
Pack it in a bag, reverse back it up to the lab and I'm ghost
I'm the storm on the coast, I'm the sun when it's close
Touch Bones and you toast
I'm the thorn in the rose
(Watch your finger)

[Verse 2]
Back at it, I jackhammer the competition
I lack manners, don't pack glamour, forgot to mention
I keep a weapon in my coat
And on the days it ain't cold I throw it in my sock
Bump it in the trunk, motherfuck trust
All I need is blunts, put the dope in my lungs
Bump it in the trunk, motherfuck trust
All I need is blunts, put the dope in my lungs

[Hook]
There's just not enough time in the day
Not enough for me to say what I wanna say
There's just not enough time in the day
24 hours never been enough for me anyway
