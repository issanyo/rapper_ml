[Verse]
I feel a totally different way
I'm for real, you can trust in what I say
I'll be here, never to go away
I fear I am always in your way
Let me know, let me know
I'll be gone, I'll be gone
But not for too long, of course, I'm always around
Never too far from you, I'm your ground
Life is changing, it's changing fast
Who would have thought that I could make it down this path
I don't know and I don't care
You pop a bean and you falling asleep
I roll a blunt then I'm up for a week
Watch how you talk when you talkin' to me
SESH get it poppin' so properly see
I press the juice while you pour up the lean
I pick my poison appropriately
You about to turn to a corpse like me
You can try but can't approach it like me
