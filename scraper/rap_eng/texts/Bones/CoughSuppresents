[Hook]
Rollin up the block pullin' 187s
Sippin' on a bottle full of cough suppressants
Haven't met the preacher haven't met the reverend
But my flows gotta be the closest thing to heaven

[Verse]
Ima break the levy Ima break the blunt
Ima show my ights, Ima shake the junt
Ima do what I want, Ima slang the drugs
Ima stack my money, Ima save that up
When I was young always wanted a range to back up
Now I'm pullin out stuntin on bitches and black trucks
Hoes they lap up I'm pimpin I'm macked up
Draped up dripped out mac-10 clipped up
Ima ghost but I thought I fucking told ya
All these bitches call me bones young graveyard soldier
Gettin little older, gettin little bigga, im a young fucking killin these blunts be the victims
Somewhere on your block lookin' for the cops got my head on a swivel got my Glock on cock
Anotha 24 in califor n-I-a they know it's all good I ain't even gotta say

[Hook]
Rollin up the block pullin' 187s
Sippin' on a bottle full of cough suppressants
Haven't met the preacher haven't met the reverend
But my flows gotta be the closest thing to heaven

[Outro]
Closest thing to Heaven
Flows gotta be the closest thing to heaven
Rollin up the block pullin' 187s
Sippin' on a bottle full of cough suppressants
