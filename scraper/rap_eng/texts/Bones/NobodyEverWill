[Intro]
How could you do this(this) to me(to me)
How could you do this(this) to me(to me)

[Verse]
Pussy boy just stop there
You act hard but you not them
I wake up and I get cash
You wake up and you stress it all
See the sweat pour down your face
You pussy I'll put you in your place
I get money I ain't even gotta say shit
And through money I don't even conversatin'
I ride with my motherfucking team
We go like some motherfucking havocs
Roll with them motherfucking high beams on
With the 3m bitch we shining
I don't give a fuck what you've got to say, bitch nobody ever will
That's the real fucking talk from the real fucking boy
From the real fucking town from the real fucking streets

[Outro]
You don't know what it takes
All you know, is it fake?
Don't own no whips, bitch please stay away

Please stay away
Please stay away
Please stay away
Please stay away
