I am just so proud of all of you who have grown up with us
And I know how tough it is some days to look with hope and confidence on the months and years ahead
But I would like to tell you what I often told you when you were much younger, I like you just the way you are
And what's more, I'm so grateful to you for helping the children in your life to know that you'll do everything you can to keep them safe
And to help them express their feelings in ways that will bring healing in many different neighborhoods
