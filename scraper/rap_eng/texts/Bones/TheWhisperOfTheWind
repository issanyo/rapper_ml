[Verse 1]
Night it be fallin
Tires they be spinnin
Deadboys crawlin
Slide to the finish
Moon seem to follow us everywhere that we’ve ridden
Street lights glowin reflecting up off the pavement
We like goin so do not come try to stop it
That will get you locked in radar ready? call the options
Team sesh watchin every time you think you lone
The tombstone legend pack your bags & take you home
The whisper of the wind says one thing
Bones
You know who you dealin with
Don’t act like you don’t know

[Hook]
Every night spent tryna get a hit
Love you if you with me motherfuck you if you ain’t
Wind blowin
Night smoke

Every night spent tryna get a hit
Love you if you with me motherfuck you if you ain’t
Wind blowin
Night smoke

[Outro]
Sesh
What?
