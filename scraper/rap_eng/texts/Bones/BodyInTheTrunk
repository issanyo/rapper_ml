[Verse]
Got a body in the trunk, ain't no turnin back
My mama taught be better, Still I don't know how to act
It's 1997 so I'm ridin with the strap
Been out for 5 years, but I'm sure that I'll be back
Back in the pen, just a life of hard crime
There's one too many dollars on my motherfuckin' mind
One too many rocks, now I'm doin' hard time
Caught me servin' on the block, say it's only part time
But you know the story, or at least how it goes
You never want what'chu got 'till it's all gone
A hundred down the road, all the windows down
I know a vacant lot that we can put him in the ground
I'm thinkin' about my future, now I'm thinkin' about my child
I wonder if I live to know the color of her eyes
Looking at the skies, don't even believe in god
Body in the trunk so there's no turnin' around

[Outro]
Got a body in the trunk, ain't no turnin back
My mama taught be better, Still I don't know how to act
(yeah... SESH...)
