[Hook]
I look like Eric Harris, but you've never seen me bangin'
I died up on the cross and I was buried in the manger
If you brought some danger just speak up then you get hammered
Doing damage, never panic, this ain't nothing for the labels

[Verse]
Coming down while I'm rolling up
Artesian water when I'm pouring up
I'm clean as fuck, but I'm mean as fuck
I got the blade on me if you runnin' up
I'll drown myself in that blunt smoke
Take shelter in dark flows
Never see the sun because I'm on the moon
Locked away, forever in my tomb

[Outro]
Tryin' to make this money flow like waterfalls
Whatever you do, know I'll be there no matter what the cause
Whatever you see, just know I'll love you till we pass away
Wherever you go, know I'll be right here if you needing me
