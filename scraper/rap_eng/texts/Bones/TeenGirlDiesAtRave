[Intro]
Claire
Are you okay?
Claire
I think she took way to many pills
I think she's dead

[Sample]
I will wipe away my tears
I shut you out, I made it clear
Gonna move on on my own
All alone, I shall go home
I will wipe away my tears
I shut you out, I made it clear
Gonna move on on my own
All alone, I shall go home

[Verse]
Watch her overdose, now she on the floor
The room start to fade and now she dying real slow
Her heart beating fast, I’m blowing off the ash
Her body laying flat, whole life start to flash
Now it’s eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Who else want to step to Bones?
Put the chrome to my dome
Pull the trigger, send me home
Back up in the graveyard, banging like a AR
Bringing back the dead, to kill 'em again when the bass drop


[Sample]
I will wipe away my tears
I shut you out, I made it clear
Gonna move on on my own
All alone, I shall go home
