We pull up, hundred blunts lit
Thinking 'bout the next O
Count the money, then it's on to the next show
Sun up, sun down, gotta get it now
But I went and got it, so I gotta go and spend it now
We pull up, hundred blunts lit
Thinking 'bout the next O
Count the money, then it's on to the next show
Sun up, sun down, gotta get it now
But I went and got it, so I gotta go and spend it now

[Verse 1: Eddy Baker]
Bitch I used to make them flips, I shoulda been in the Olympics
School of hardknocks nigga, I was freaking suspended
I'm eating veggies, smoking weed, everything is nutritious
Rappers hating on me, say hello to the villain
Posted up in Bel Air, yeah I call it big willin'
Ego hella' big now, I swear that shit reach the ceiling
My team gettin' paid now, its a wonderful feeling
Every time we hit the club, gotta fuck up the building
Club owner always tripping, won't let us in the building
And you know my trees stink, like a pot of the chitlins
Pull up in that muscle with my niggas, we piffin
I'm with my bad white bitch, call her Jessica Simpson

We pull up, hundred blunts lit
Thinking 'bout the next O
Count the money, then it's on to the next show
Sun up, sun down, gotta get it now
But I went and got it, so I gotta go and spend it now
We pull up, hundred blunts lit
Thinking 'bout the next O
Count the money, then it's on to the next show
Sun up, sun down, gotta get it now
But I went and got it, so I gotta go and spend it now

[Verse 2: Bones]
I don't get paid every week, bitch I get paid every minute
Since I dropped outta school my money been in attendance
Don't you ever reach your hands out to me
Bitch we did this on our own, let us eat
No Sesh when the moon hit the street
Bitch I'm cashed, but I'm still rolling like a freak
We just slidin' down the motherfucking highway
No I never had a job, but I'm feeling like it's Friday
Pool in the backyard, cars in the driveway
I guess thats just what happens when I start to do it my way
Since they see I'm blowin' everybody being nice now
Bitch, back back, I ain't got no room in my life now
