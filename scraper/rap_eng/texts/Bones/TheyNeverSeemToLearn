[Verse]
Now you dressing like a weathered peasant
Since the shit is trending heavy
Looking broke like Levees, but your tag on bag say Fendi
You disgust me not offend me
Pray you'll never feel me near
Hold my breathe, 10 Mississippi
I don't want to breathe the same air
We absorb through our pores so I condemn myself from them
Pin my hair back and then share all the tales I got to tale
From the then to the now
Moments live inside the ground
I can see and hear the sound
When I walk familiar grounds
Organic cotton line my pockets
Ain't no blood inside these fibers
Millions dying, sewing and tying
For all the stupid shit you buying
We ain't here long so it's easy to ignore
The happening's and just act as if this life is strictly yours

[Hook]
If I disappeared I know the world wouldn't notice
The moon would rise in the night
The sun would set in the morning
And I wonder, would they ever have guessed I was here?
If I disappeared I know the world wouldn't notice
The moon would rise in the night
The sun would set in the morning
And I wonder, would they ever have guessed I was here?
