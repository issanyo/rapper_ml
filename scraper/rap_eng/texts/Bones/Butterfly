[Verse]
Creeping up from behind
Money up on my mind
Butterfly on my side
Make it fly then you die
I've got lies in my eyes
All my times been reprised
Compromised with my lies
Now I'm stuck inside my mind
Resurrect everytime I die
Crash and survive everytime I ride
Cash sight eyes with a blunt I fly
On a broomstick, high up in the sky
Levitate down 'til my feet feel ground
I don't give a fuck how you feel now
Never gave a fuck how we felt then
But now we on and now you want it now
Rolling with the roof blown off
Stolen when the blade get drawn
Hold it, do you really wanna live?
Do you really wanna die?
Do you really wanna try me?
Show me, tell me, throw me, roll me
Body made of drugs, might as well just smoke me
Hold me closely, put me away
Acting like a killer but you just so safe

[Hook]
That's just how it is
That's just how it is, I said that's just how it is
That's just how it is, I said that's just how it is
That's just how it is, I said that's just how it is
