[Verse 1: Bones]
White punk on dope
Black bitch on coke
She said she feel like dying
I said I feel real throwed
Neck drippin' in gold
Bitch knows that I'm Bones
Bitch know that we fuck
Then I gotta go ghost
Gotta ride around with my team, Ride around with that lean
Since I ride around with my Ice, I gotta ride around with that heat

Know what I'm sayin'.....sesh.....what...Bones

[Verse 2: Bones]
Yeah, Skeletons in my closet
Rap game in my pocket
Got a 64 with hydraulics
And 44 that stay knocking
Marble floors when im walking
Big blunts so I'm coughing
Platinum cover my headstone, got diamonds all over my coffin
Dave up in the kitchen
Bitches all at admission
Brother's  bringing me gold chains
My blunt wraps and my slippers
House shoes and a big robe
Living life like Deathrow
94' like im on tour, with a bulletproof fucking vest on
Like go ahead bitch shoot me
Put a cut to my movie
With a bullet you can take my life, but you can never take what it could be
What the fuck that I would've been
What the fuck my son will be
Where I would've been at 21
Where I would've been at 23
See even if you fucking kill me now
You still ain't doing shit
You're still too fucking late
I'm the Skinny White Pimp Bitch
Bones
