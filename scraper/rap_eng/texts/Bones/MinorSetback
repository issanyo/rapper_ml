[Verse 1]
Whether it's dark or the sky is lit up
Whatever the time if my eyes open I get up
If you are not helping me, I do not wanna hear, wait up
You were asleep every night that I stayed up
Time steady passing, it's hard to keep my balance
I know thinking's normal but I over thought to the point of damage
Cannot reverse it, DNA, cursed
Every 24 hours, curl and twist these blunts like cursive
Tightrope walker, world down below
Watch your breath and your step, for if you don't, you'll go

[Hook]
Tightrope walker, world down below
Watch your breath and your step, for if you don't, you'll go
Tightrope walker, world down below
Watch your breath and your step, for if you don't, you'll go

[Outro]
Minor setback nightmares never go on vacation
I need a second to breathe, my lungs are waiting for confirmation
