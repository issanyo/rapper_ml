[Verse]
I don't gotta pop a seal to sleep walk
I let my dope speak for me bitch I don't even talk
Every time you speak we know it's cheap talk
If you see us keep it quiet if we in public
Fuck a closed casket bitch put me with the trees
Let me rot, throw some seeds, water me and give me leaves
All I've ever wanted was to be
Breathing the way the ocean be
Haired tied back so I know what I'm doin'
Boys try to emulate just end up looking stupid
Thirty Blunts in the Buick had officer for the truance
No you would hate if you knew us
But you say we young and we stupid
But you the only one that stupid
If we talking 'bout the movement
You got shit that need some moving
Gotta job to pay, your cool with but your the last thing coolin'
While you sweatin' bout some bills prolly smoking you choosin'

[Chorus]
Push away
Push away
Push away now
I can't take it another day
Let it fade out
Push away
Push away
Push away now
I don't ever wanna think about it

[Outro]
Push away
Push away
Push away now
I can't take it another day
Let it fade out
Push away
Push away
Push away now
I can't take it another day
Let it fade out
Push away
Push away now (push away now)
Push away
Push away Now (push away now)
Push away
Push away now (push away now)
