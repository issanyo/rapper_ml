My neck light up just like trip pants
So cameras they aimin like hitmans
Don't give a fuck where your clique stand
As long as its somewhere that we aint
Never was such thing as free play
So I know I spend my time [?]
I told him I get it like anyway
Get on the stage and just [?]

Bitch, this the shit that I been preaching from the start
Now the whole planet acting like they saw it from afar
If you wasn't with us then don't you get to acting out
Saw you then, no words, struggling then laughin' out

[Outro:]
Don't take no effort, we do it no pressure, everything forever we set up the standards, put out the cones, watch where you go, eyes on the road[x2]
