[Chorus: Bones & Na$ty Matt]
Kreepin In the kut,In the kut,In the fucking kut
(x6)

[Verse 1 - Bones]

Bathtub full of money, black hummer full o' hunnies
Rolex fo' the princess cuts, fuck the king and let the princes fuck (fuck)
Just riding round, me and Matt in that black Ferrari
Na$ty in up in the back seat, I'm plotting murders he picking targets (bang)
Syrup up in my sprite, Matt loading that choppa', me i'm shinning that knife
Diamonds up in my ice, since rhymers been in my life
Ever since i became a legend I've been getting the things i like
A lot of drugs I'm smoking
A lot of guns i'm holding
A lot of raps i'm kicking so it's a lot of money i'm folding
Team SESH global gang, golden Wang that's a set
Bitches love, dudes hate
Pay with love, pay respect
Yeah
Na$ty
SESH
Yeah
Beat god
Pay respect
Give it all for fucking Na$ty Matt bitch

[Chorus]
Kreepin In the kut,In the kut,In the fucking kut (x6)

[Na$ty Matt]

Ridin' low up in that civic
Fuckin' and duckin' these bitches
They all up on my business, BBSes they blowin' kisses
My brother Drew up in the front my cousin Jube up in the back
Plenches with this mac, brush the clip and the rat attack
Boom, clearin' the room, prayin' for gold up on my tomb
Pullin' that thing and it's doom, all black like the fuckin' groom
Camo forces, 90's porsches, hammered voices, while I'm readin' sources, lookin' for the chewin'
Breakin' in the freak show
Put that on my ego
Trap house full of freak hoes
Pimp named Matt Hilfiger on my back
Lookin' at my cartiers with my gold stack
Lookin' for that compressor, gotta keep that varetta
These rats be after my cheddar
That bitch I really don't stress her
Hail in the sill drop you on the mac
Kickin' the dope with that cane mask and a barbed wire bat

[Chorus]
Kreepin In the kut,In the kut,In the fucking kut (X6)
