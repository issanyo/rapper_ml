[Verse]
Label this shit that won't let them judge
Smoke while I strut through the mud
Say what you want, still, I do what I does
Breath of fresh air I'm a gift to your lungs
Fuck what you say, it ain't true
Night to the day, we ain't you
No need to impress you, no need to out-dress you
Just need to outlive you, so I'm eating better
Died 100 times now I'm back once more
The graveyard shake and the moon get low
The time get slow, and the blunts never go
Out like you, when your 50 seconds over
I'm contract sober, you gotta lie smoking
Locked in a deal, now you on the shelf molding
Thought is a green bid, at least where it's poking
Now you down, bad knees locked by the police

[Hook]
Please step away this is just what I do now
Get the fuck 'round me, if I don't know you now
Please step away this is just what I do now
Still in the yard, but we lie with them tombs now
