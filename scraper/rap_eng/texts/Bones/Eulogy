[Verse]
Walking down the backroads, goddamn
Heartagram chain looking just like HIM
Eulogy blunts tell me I ain't gonna live
Still I roll these woods till the lights go dim
Mothafuck that
Sitting in my house like mothafuck rap
That feeling that you get when this shit's so easy
Pray that when you die and come back that you'll be me

[Hook x2]
I am your biggest problem
While they're ready to off you
Stand up and stand like the auction
Put your corpse up on the market
