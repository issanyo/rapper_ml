[Hook: Bones]
Won't fuck that's a beat track
Won't smoke unless it's backwood wraps
She won't ride unless she got somewhere to go
She get high so she don't want to go
She won't fuck until she about to go
Cause when she fuck she know she got to go
(She know she got to go, yeah)

[Verse 1: Bones]
When I'm walking in the room
Know I'm stepping on marble
No cellphone, can't nobody call me
No license no insurance calling
No contracts bitch that's real balling
Pullin up tanks TEAMSESH be the army
Ride with my brothas
Case you ever tryna harm me
Trippin, fallin, Jerry King Lawler
King of the ring briefcase full of dollars
Take control it down roll an ounce
Pound in the trunk
Another pound in the house, yeah
That's skinny white pimpin
I ain't hangin over pots skinny white whippin

Too fucking young to be going this awful
Blowin on doja, no limits Soulja

And that bitch go bang

Switchblade in my hand
Yeah, blade in my hand
What? Bones, SESH

[Hook: Bones]
Won't fuck that's a beat track
Won't smoke unless it's backwood wraps
She won't ride unless she got somewhere to go
She get high so she don't want to go
She won't fuck until she about to go
Cause when she fuck she know she got to go
(I know I gotta roll, what?)
