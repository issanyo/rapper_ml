[Verse]
While you wake up and get your cake up
Bitch I lay up while I pick my poison
Rolling while you going out
And showing why they should adore you
Hope that you get all the fame
Dance around on top the stage
Get everything you dreamed
Then tell me "Bones, it just don't feel the same"
You still get soaked in the rain
Money don't exclude you from pain
Fame ain't nothing but a single syllable that we use to say
"Known by some people, but not known truly either"
Thinking you know me from a song
Is like summing up someone from a voicemail
No rhymes, no time codes
Could keep me inside my rhythm
Never needed 'em, I'm conceited
Blunts die every time I hit 'em

[Outro]
Hold up let me get myself together
Hold up let me get myself together
