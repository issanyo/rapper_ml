[Verse 1: Bones]
Twenty-eight karats, thirty pointers in the hit
Princess cuts I swear I damn near cut my wrists
Never had shit so I'm not used to having this
Trying to make [?] boy you need to get a grip
Banana peel blunts, mess up you gon’ slip
You only kill once, now you king of clips
[?] running like Glock locked up on your hip
They knock you down like doors, surprised that you can afford
[?]
I'm worse off than I thought, I prefer the room all dark
Your upbringing is sweet, your whole style is neat
I'm happy you’ve never seen your friends leave in their sleep
It's tragic, the hill is steep
In line with bad dreams
I flash back to rags getting soaked in the sink
The price of copper's down last time I checked
I know it's hard times for the rats in the midwest
What?

[Verse 2: LIL FPS ICE WATCH]
New watch doing backflips like gymnastics
Three shots like a hat trick, that's the goal, ho
Told me she don't need me
Told that bitch to leave me
Kicked her out for talkin 'cause that bitch was too needy
I ain't sharing nothing but a bullet
Doing dirt like Joe plus I put two up in your mullet
You can try me like you think I wouldn’t do it
Guess again, leave you blowing in the wind when I pull it
Diamonds falling out my cheeks, fell asleep in diamond sheets
Tuck a rich nigga in, making money in my sleep
I’mma probably rob a nigga I don't even need that shit
I do it for adrenaline, take that shit and leave that shit
Frankly you can have that ho, ’cause I don't even need that bitch
Different whips every day, can't even believe this shit
I can't even believe this shit
Different whips every day, I can’t even believe this shit
Catch me at your local Target looking like a target
All this ice up on my wrist I harvest like a farmer
Thought I went to Harvard, thought I was a pharmacist
The way I stay with drugs, like I can't even call it quits
Used to run up in the stores lookin for a handout
Now I step up in and buy it all 'cause I'm the man now
Didn't know 'em last year, now these niggas fam now
Took some Ls last year, so I changed the plan now
I don't think these niggas understand (understand)
I don't think these niggas understand that I'm the man now
I don't think these niggas understand
I don't think these niggas understand I'm in demand now
