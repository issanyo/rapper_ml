[Verse]
The deadest, the pettiest, why would they let me in
Why the fuck would anybody start with me
Bones the ruler, that Ruger won't do shit I'll prove it
Put one to my head and watch me still breathe
You don't gotta go and believe me
See the day that I l-e-a-v-e this whole scene will terminate permanently
They see the skull and they know it's the team
Design you like Tyrus, put you in a creek
6 feet deep that's where you can find me
I know all the spots no way you can hide from me
Extendo clip in the Glock oh please
Oh behave watch me reprimand thee
Dunce cap on ya put you in a corner
TeamSESH bonehead turn you to a goner
Lifespan longer my songs shorter
Only lines you gots' the ones that you snortin'
I became a legend fuck all these peasants
1522 counting riches peep the ledger
Vegan leather synthetic suede
Lock you in a cage like the food that you ate
Take you to the healing fields lay you down make it real
Time for vacation cabin hidden in the hills

[Hook]
Pop quiz, I got it locked, bitch
It's the deadman graveyard locksmith
Top notch shit, on the block shit
Buck knives in my right and left pockets
