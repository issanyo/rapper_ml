[Verse 1: Slim Guerilla]
Sipping on some fucking yac
Chilling like I'm [?]
Nigga talking shit
My have to lay that nigga up on his back
SG Rilla Mane all up in this fucking thang hoe
Tryna get my money quick
Gotta collect that fucking dough
I don’t even know
Why these niggas always tryna flex
Nigga, always talking shit
And get your body laid next
In the ditch, in the river
Nigga, you wanna die quicker
Tryna take my money
I don’t understand that
You look like a goddamn dummy
Nigga, I’m a pimp
Gotta pimp these fucking hoes mane
Chilling on the scene
In this mothafucka daily gang
Heading to the liquor store
Sipping on some Alize
Then I might be going to the crib
Cheefing on some fucking haze
Why these niggas wanna hate
Mane nigga I don’t know
I will play that fucking hoe
And play that hoe like a Nintendo
64
Getcho money nigga if you trynna get rich
Nigga I am chilling on the scene with your mothafuckin' bitch

[Verse 2: Bones]
Gotta Cadillac on 22s
We be in the dashboard
Slim got the fucking tool step up and get clapped on
Ash, then I hit the gas
Get my fucking mesh on
Bones got the fucking blade
Bones got the mask on
Motherfuck a rap song
This is just some rhymes ho
Raw flow, condo
one in every time zone
Sesh til I fucking rest
Ana on my fucking chest
Razor to your neck
You tryna say I ain't the fucking best
Yah with the dah
Fuck you saying we got next
We got now
We got later
I got jewels hanging from my neck
Young Rodney Mullins flipping chicks up on they fucking back
Nollie laser beam 720 on the fucking tech
Swerving in the fuckin lanes
Gripping on some fucking gram
Down south, pimping
Switching houses when I be pimping mane
Team SESH Raider Klan put they body in the land
Cornfield cemetery
Scarecrow killa mane
