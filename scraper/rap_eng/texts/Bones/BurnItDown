[Verse 1]
Burn it down, burn it all down, down
Look around, take another look around (look around)
Are you pleased with the bed that you made (that you made)
Are you content with the lies that you said (that you said)
Can you sleep, baby? Tell me, can you sleep?
Knowing what you did, just knowing what you did
Tryna run you know, try to hide, I just hope you fucking die
You can't run, you know, you can't hide
From real life, it's do or die
You can't run, you know, you can't hide
You find it hard to sleep at night

Ghosts in the dream you afraid to fall asleep (asleep)
Say you don't believe but you down on your knees
But you'll never get an answer (never get an answer)
Backwoods in my lungs, pocket full of drugs
Feel like I'm dying but I keep holding on
You wake me from my nightmares

[Chorus]
Die slow for me
Die slow for me
Die slow for me
Die slow for me

[Outro]
Die for me
Die for me
Die for me
