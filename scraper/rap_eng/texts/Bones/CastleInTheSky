[Verse 1]
I'm high, I'm never low
I do what others won't
I see what others don't
I flow until I grow
I go until I crow
I roll and then I smoke
They all know that it's Bones
As soon as they see the storm
The clouds they rolling in
The tides they coming close
My mind is on a level
That's far too hard for most
I'm far too cool to boast
So me I just show
See me I just rap
See you, you just don't
You shoot, I never shot
You rhyme, I never rhyme
You die, I never die
I'mma multiply and divide
You search but me I find
You sleeping while I'm rhyming
You say that you wanna rap
You say that you wanna grind
You got no fucking time
You got no fucking cash
You full of fucking excuses
I'm full of blunt ash
Take a nap, drink a five
Leave the rapping to the Gods
In my quarters on my throne
In my castle in the sky

[Verse 2]
Jet black hair on my cold white skin
Remind you of the winter when night rolls in (x2)

[Verse 3]
I'm froze
Freezing, freezing, freezing (x3)

Freezing, freezing, freezing
I'm froze

[Outro]
