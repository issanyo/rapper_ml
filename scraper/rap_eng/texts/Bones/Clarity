[Hook: Bones]
I don't need to fabricate something to believe in
If you don't believe it you should probably leave it
Hundred one reasons why you think you're right
You're just scared of a contact in life
We’ve been lost but we don't care
We’ve been low but we don't care

[Verse 1: Saphir]
Does it really matter now?
Everything we talk and touch
Placing all my thoughts around, is this the product?
Breathe in, let go, sinking, so low
See where shine gold seasons cutthroat

[Interlude: Marylin Manson]
"I think that church has very little to do with spirituality. I think its something you have to find in yourself. It's about expressing your deepest fears and your emotions and putting it in something. It's not about living in fear and praying and hoping you're not going to go to hell. That's not very spiritual to me."

"Usually people hate what they are afraid of, it's the classic story. I think that even goes back to Jesus. You know. They were afraid to understand him so they killed him. I don't disagree with a lot of the ideals he was trying to get across. I just don't like how people have used them to exploit others and make children feel guilty for having imagination and wanting to be individuals."

[Pre Hook]
Growing up its the life of the suicide
Looking at the sky asking God if I'm doing fine
Writing out my dream should I try its a homicide
Its another day looking down at my bloody eyes
Take away my heart for today
Take away my soul separate all these signs that consist in my head
I'm the snake with my skin that I shed
Lay me down to the porch and I'm dead
Its the life of the suicide looking at the sky asking God if I'm doing fine
Am I doing fine?
Am I doing fine now?
