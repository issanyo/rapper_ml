[Verse 1]
Drinking like I'm Julian, pull up to the school and then
Heard a loud pop, saw the students they were shooting at
Blood on the sidewalk, heart beating fast now
Thought it was a joke til I saw the TEC-9's out
Chalk outlines now, sounds of the crime loud
Helicopters, parents crying, fear is alive now
Body count raise as the cops sit and wait
Too scared to go in, maybe see their final day
The wind pickin' up, bodies getting laid down
Say the music, say the parents, but who the fuck's to blame now?
Nobody, no cops thinking "Hey, maybe, probably, we should go in the building, we could save a couple lives"
Fuck it, rather stay outside where it's safe
Hundred twenty minutes later now they 'bout to save the day
Tears of the town til my neck 'bout to drown
Head up, eyes closed, I don't wanna hear a sound

[Outro]
The breath in your lungs is the death of your son
It's the love of your life, it's the loss of your touch
The breath in your lungs is the death of your son
It's the love of your life, it's the loss of the touch
