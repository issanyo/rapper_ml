[Bridge: Bones]
Creeping out the cut and grab my gauge up off the fucking shelf
Busting drugs, busting guns, bitch, we don't know nothing else
If you tryna fucking step, get pressed up with that fucking TEC
A deuces between yo legs, I know you can't fuck with that

[Verse 1: Bones]
I blow out the busta's back, they know I stay fucking strapped
In that two-tone Chevrolet with that fucking MAC
The return of fucking rap, the return of the fucking mac
I'm back with that 90's flow, I go like it's '94
I pimp like it's '96, knock hoes like they dominos
They down on the fucking flo' and still asking for fucking mo'
Bitch, yeah, you gotta go, baby, I gotta run
The 5-O is watching, they found my prints on that fucking gun

[Bridge: Bones]
Creeping out the cut and grab my gauge up off the fucking shelf
Busting drugs, busting guns, bitch, we don't know nothing else
If you tryna fucking step, get pressed up with that fucking TEC
A deuces between yo legs, I know you can't fuck with that

Creeping out the cut with my yams, now Fly want some hay
