[Verse]

I remember it so vividly, ice cold back roads life back in Michigan
How you supposed to miss it when nobody say they missin' ya
History down the drain but I am just as much to blame as the other half
Fuck it, I'm livin' life and I love it
As I'm now steady workin' workin' towards no budget
Towards that ferrari and that big ass apartment
Oh you thought I meant a room? Fuck no I meant a complex
Don't believe in objects, material things
But what the fuck why not when you bathin' in change
Just the way of the grain, way it grip to my hand
It's just the heat of the sun, it's just my feet in the sand
They got me hopin', I ain't ever gotta be broke again
Never sold drugs cuz I'd end up rolling them
End up smoking all the weed I was holding
End up gettin' smoked in an alley in Oakland
So I took the other route, I'ma be a fuckin' rapper
Been spittin' my whole life why not get some money off this shit, it's nonsense, but fuck it so it's life
You wake up every day you fall asleep every night
It's just so fuckin' crazy, I'm floatin' outta space
How could you waste a second bitchin' bout how much you make
How much you fuckin' hate stupid shit throughout your day
Just for me feel your heart feel the beat

[Hook]

Let it bang, let it bang
Let it bang, let it bang
Let it bang, let it bang
Ya
