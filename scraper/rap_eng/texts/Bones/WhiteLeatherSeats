[Verse 1: Bones]
Yo, this that top back, reclining
Riding 'round just shining, shit
White skin, black diamonds
When I'm sliding 'round, my chain blind a bitch
White seats with the black trim
White tee with the black Timbs
That white kid with the black kids
That bass striking like lightning
My flow is something like roll
People sell me they soul
I'm hitting curbs while I hit the swerve
While yo girlfriend hitting my phone
Got a big screen in the dash, got a 12 gauge in the trunk
When I pop that bitch, you can watch a flick or you can get hit with that pump, yeah

[Bridge: Yung Vadi]
Coming down throwed in the Lone Star State
With Th@ Kid pouring up and the Swisher looking green
Coming down throwed in the Lone Star State
With Th@ Kid pouring up and I do it for my state, aye

[Verse 2: Yung Vadi]
Syrup got me thirsty and it's like 3:30
In the morning banging Screw, banging Screw up, know I'm saying?
OG sipper, candy dripper, need a codeine sticker
Texas made me, when I'm thirsty I be sipping liquor
Posted up with my boy Elmo Kennedy
SESH is going, Th@ Kid, that kid on that Hennessy
1MillionBlunts, got a bitch up to the ceiling
1MillionBlunts 'cause I'm one in a million, player

[Outro: Bones]
You see me sipping, see me pimping, see me fucking flowing
You see me flipping, see me dipping, see me fucking going
You see me sipping, see me pimping, see me fucking flowing
You see me flipping, see me dipping, see me fucking going
