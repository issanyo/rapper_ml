[Verse]
(Ah)
Barely gone, barely here, uh
My team rarely ever fear none
Unless the woods start to get low
Then we-we pile up in the pick up to the store to get more
Slide under lavender skies
That blade is my disguise
I'm too ugly, please shield your eyes
That line might be reprised but It's a warning not a lie
See the shine on my side, now you got Stevie Wonders eyes
Sure ain't with the DeadBoys go pick another side
Shift back and forth until your morals have aligned
You never spent time on shit that really winds
Up and catapults you to a greater divine
"Stop, drop, and roll," I'm yelling it in the mirror
The human torch is here setting fire to my peers

[Refrain]
Barely gone, barely here, uh
My team rarely ever fear none
