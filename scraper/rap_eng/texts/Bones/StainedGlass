[Intro - ?]

Body in the trunk so there's no turning around

[Verse]

Too many people dyin'
Too many people livin'
Too many lives we takin'
Too many lives get ruined
Ridin' round in my Buick
It's nighttime we cruisin'
That slim pimp named Bones
But I bet you that you knew that
I'ma do this for my mom
I'ma do this for my father
I'ma do this for my brother
Let the beat go and now I'm water
I disappear on the beat
Look in the mirror you'll see
Sayin' my name like three times I reappear and you bleed
That's TeamSESH 'till I leave

[Hook x2]

Ridin' in the range
These bitches go insane
They see that it's Bones so they all scream my name
It's 1998 and we just ridin' to the melody
Swishers to the breeze, that's the TeamSESH mentality
