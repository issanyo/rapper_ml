[Verse]
Young Bobby Kennedy, bitches gon' remember me
Sippin' on my remedy, feelin' like I'm seventeen
Keep me in your memories, motherfuck a prayer (fuck it)
You don't need a god when you're this fuckin' rare (clean)
Women by the pair (what?)
Drugs in the air (fuck)
Backwood Boy, white skin, long hair (SESH)
Pager on my hip (huh?)
Razor on my dick
It's best you come equipped if you steppin' to the pimp (bitch)
I don't need rims (no)
Cause I don't need a whip
Nineteen years, I ain't got a license yet (oh)
I'd rather that a bitch drive, Ima just smoke (SESH)
Lean my seat back, feet up, blowin' O's (O)

[Hook]
Bitch that's SESH, blunts to the neck (neck)
Dollar store white tee, ninety-nine cents (what?)
Bitch I am a legend (yeah)
You are just a peasant (Bones)
Black marble floors when I'm house shoe stepping (SESH)
Bitch I am a legend (what?)
You are just a peasant (what?)
Black marble floors when I'm house shoe stepping (SESH)

[Outro]
(SESH)
Bitch I am a legend (Bones)
You are just a peasant
Black marble floors when I'm house shoe stepping
SESH
