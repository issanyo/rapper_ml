(Snippet)

[Verse]
Sittin' in the valley, rollin' up personals, no alley oops
Ashin' what the fuck is passin'
Bones be selfish, sad because it's true
Everybody in the game know my name
But I don't know their's, sorry to say
Sun up, sun down, I been workin' today
Till the second that I lay, I be workin' away

[Hook]
I got it badder than Usher
I got it badder than Usher
I got it badder than Usher
I got it badder than Usher
I got it badder than Usher
My chain like a bag of gushers
I got it badder than Usher
I got it badder than Usher
