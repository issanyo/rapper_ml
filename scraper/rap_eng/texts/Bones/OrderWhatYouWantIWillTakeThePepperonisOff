"The alcohol kills more people than drugs
The alcohol kills more people than drugs
Cigarettes, Cigarettes
They kill 325,000 people a year, but what are we required to do? Subsidize the tobacco industry
I mean, if people wanna really..."

[Verse]
All my money go to dope
Even if money coming slow, I still find a way to smoke
But money always coming in
Never signed on the line but I'm paid like I did
The young white devil, all our shows look like they metal
Bones rolling up them petals then I'm back to my vessel
Haven't showered in a week, nothing special bout me
I'm just harder than whoever wanna act like the king
