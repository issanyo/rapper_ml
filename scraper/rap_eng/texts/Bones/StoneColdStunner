[Verse 1: Wicca Phase Springs Eternal]
Third eye open and telling me Iâ€™m numb
Find me tripping on cemetery love
Girls like me 'cause I look like Bones
Triple six fiending like California clones
See me shut up
Tell me nothing
Eyes like crystal
Stone cold stunner
Eyes like crystal
Stone cold stunner

[Verse 2: Bones]
Riding in the drop with no roof on the top
I don't wanna go but I know I gotta stop
What do I have to do
To show you that I love you
I've been sinking
I've been drowning
Please come save me
I need you badly
