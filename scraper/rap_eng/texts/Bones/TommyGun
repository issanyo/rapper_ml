{Verse]

I was 13 runnin' wild in the fuckin' streets
Now I'm 19 ridin' in some bucket seats
Ramen noodles on the stove and the fridge empty
Stomach growling, water boiling, bread lookin' tempting
Take the garbage out, wrap it while I shut the can
Drag it to the curb, drop it off, spark what's in my hand
Young legend still I'm living like a peasant
All I need is a mic and you know that I could bless you
Gold doubloons on my neck spark her like the ocean
When the sun hits the liquid in the early morning
Long hair down my back like the white ranger
Young tommy, gold body, eye of the tiger
Casey Jones denim
Cold banes flannel
Fuck art, smoke blunts, do what's on your mental
Never took opinions, only took my pencil
I wrote team I wrote sesh and then they came together
Ice cream hoody with the bathing ape shoes
BBC bucket with some diamond dollar pantaloons
1932 ridin' in the model T, tommy gun up out the roof in case you tryna bother me
They all hollerin', young Bones father me
I get my belt I shut the door and teach 'em how it ought to be
Questions like they auditing, young rap oddity
They never heard a sound and seen a sight quite as hard as me

[Outro x2]

And I don't be up on no rap shit
I'm on that SESH shit, young night rat shit
