[Verse 1: Bones]
Kids overflowing hate till they graduate
Some up the drugs, some sit down and wait
Livingston county half-passed 'fore they walk the stage
Off themselves cause they so thought that help was never on the way
Back on my mission again
Bring all this shit to one end
Talking 'bout bitches again
Fuck you and all of your friends
You can go missing today
When I talk, look in my face
Look at the lights while they fade
People are strange, they never say "aye"
"Bones, wassup, we haven't talked in some years
I hope you good, I see the music shit you doing getting big"
Didn't care when I was struggling and nobody would listen
Bitch, get the fuck back, give me some distance, no, I don't get it

[Hook]
They're all talking and they're all laughing
And that's just fine with me
I can feel their whispers and hear their murmurs
and that's okay with me,
and that's okay with me,
and that's okay with me,
and that's okay with me
