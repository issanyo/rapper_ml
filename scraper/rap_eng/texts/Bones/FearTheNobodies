[Verse]
You may have won this time
But I'm coming back for you
I know that it's the time
Can't let my plans fall on through
Look me in the eyes
Tell me what do you
See when you look inside
Who I am, who am I to you
Drugs, drugs everywhere
Blunt smoke hanging in the air
The reason that I'm dying in my lungs
But I don't want to go, unless it's with you, girl
