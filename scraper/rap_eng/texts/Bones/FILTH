[Verse 1]

It's hard to change but fuck it I'ma change rap to my bones in the grave till I'm home once again in the planet where I came
Roll blunt rock stage round the world in 80 days
It's the fuckin' team, flow nice smoke mean
All I do is kick raps
All I do is smoke weed
Fuck a job, chase a dream
Fuck dave, kill beats
Every day a movie scene when you livin' like me

[Hook 4x]

It's nice to say but it's hard to change
