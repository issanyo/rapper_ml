[Verse 1]
Diamond chain, diamond frames, shining up my diamond rings
Diamond life, diamond flow, rolling up my diamond bones
On the throne, blowing O's, thinking fast, rapping slow
Hold the phone, let me go, let me snap into my zone
Let me fade, let me swing, 150 in the lane
Got the coke-white Caddy, gripping wood with the grain
Dice in the mirror, ash in the tray
Creeping, peeping in my mirror, waiting for the fuckin' day
Waking up inside the grave, smoke pouring out my veins
Headstone start cracking and the Earth start to shake
Breaking the mold when I'm breaking the flow
Snap back to reality, and now I'm just a ghost
