[Intro: Pouya]
Yo yo yo bitch
What they do
Fuck wit me
Pouya and Th@ Kid
I know you've been waiting forever
I know you've been waiting 145 years for this shit
Fuck with me, bitch #NEVAGAVEAFUCK

[Verse 1: Pouya]
It's Pouya ho
And I pull ya ho
Don't test me ho
Cause I be schoolin' hoes
Who you fooling, ho?
You droolin' with the thirstiness
So it's time to dip
Poison this pussy don't touch it like baseball you bound to catch something so grab yourself a glove
I beast in the field, the fuck how they feel
I'm grabbing the real
Too many hoes in the open
Tryna get wet like the ocean
Causing commotion when the booty in motion
Layin it down in front of da crowd
Tank top, no bra, titties out
Ratchet, grab me the finest the south
Don't come around my way, better take another route
I ain't playin' witcha now
Got the one and only style that competed with me now
Cause they jealous I'm posted, I'm chillin', just watching Goodfellas
I ain't worried 'bout a thang
Fuck swag, my shirt got a stain and I still get hoes
What you know about that?
The type of the pack that never go slack
It's simple as that, so whatcha know about dat

[Hook: Bones]
Let it breathe, Let it breathe
Let it breathe, Let it breathe
Let it breathe, Let it breathe
Let it breathe, Let it breathe

[Verse 2: Bones]
Stone cold I'm stuntin'
Top rope I'm jumpin'
I gotta lotta drugs
I'm with a lotta thugs
So I promise that you don't want it
I'm in the backseat of that Hummer
I'm ridin' round with my brothers
Got chopper city up in the deck
Flickin' ash like its nothin'
It's 1 million hoes every time I flip my phone
Rollin' 1 million bones just to get me back up in my zone
Okay I'm zonin'
I'm flowin'
She lookin' like she wanna know me
Young Val Venis my towel long
But she wanna take that shit off me
I get a lotta head like Al Snow
Benoit when I kill it
I'm comin' down like its 99
And Owen Hart til upon the ceilin
1, 2
3, 4
Bones come to yo damn door
5, 6
7, 8
White punk wit dat switchblade
Razor up in my socks
Please don't give me the reason
I be livin' my life like one day at a time
So please just fuckin' believe it
I be doin' this shit like every day
Dropped out when I was 16
Packed my bags
Then I caught a plane
And now I'm layin' beats six feet deep

[Hook: Bones]
Let it breathe, let it breathe
(What)
Let it breathe, Let it breathe
(Yeah)
Let it breathe, Let it breathe
