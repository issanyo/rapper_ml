[Intro]
"I would have to be the incredible hulk. I'd love to be the incredible hulk cause nobody could, nobody could win against me. I'd smash them all and I think it'd be a lot of fun."

[Verse 1: Bones]
Somehow it's just not hard to me
I see you struggling and it's hard to see
Think you're a big man, with some big plans
Think there's power in your stance, and it's odd to me
If you want something go get it, don't wait around to see the winter
Spring doesn't fall in the summer
Life doesn't stop, so make use of the minutes
Make use of the minutes, we get them and we're wasting the seconds
Only regret I regret is regretting the things I've regretted

[Pre-Hook: Bones]
Think about it, think about it
Get back to me
Think about it, think about it
Get back to me

[Hook: Bones]
Where the hundreds go down, where the bottles all round
Where the hundreds go down, where the bottles all round
Where the hundreds go down, where the bottles all round

[Verse 2: Xavier Wulf]
I pull off like I'm Takumi
Except I'm in this S13
All I'm gonna do is keep on riding, while they follow me
Hear me in the trees, from the mountains, when the tires screech
Catch me in the streets, with my squad while we smoke the scene
I don't give no fuck about who mad, I look up for me
Why go switch positions, when you got a hometown team
All she wanna do is smoke some weed, while she stare at me
I pulled off on her, because I knew that's not the best for me
She pulled up on me in her Sileighty tryna reach for me
She can't even race, cause she can't focus when she think of me
When I look ahead, I see all that I'm gon' need to see
I can not recline, until the humans learn to spread some peace
See me smoking weed, while I think about some certain things
Imma' ride forever, I don't need to stop for anything

[Hook: Bones]
Where the hundreds go down, where the bottles all round
Where the hundreds go down, where the bottles all round
Where the hundreds go down, where the bottles all round
