Bitch I'm down, Bitch I'm down for whatever, ever
Bitch I'm down, Bitch I'm down for whatever, ever
Don't be acting clever
No don't be acting better
I thought somebody told em bitch we down for whatever
Heard about you ain't a damn thing new
Still walk around with a lame ass crew
You and your friends trying hard just to do
Shit that we do
I'll show you a thing or two
Sweat it all out just to come to the truth
Die, every blink in my eye just for you
Minutes tick and pass and then seconds tick and leave
But no matter what the time there is nothing in-between
Books on the shelf, Wood lit
Smoke another bag while the fuckin moon lit
Say you sleep when you dead
But I'm up when you down
I scheme when you dream
You sound as a pound
Books on the shelf, Wood lit
Smoke another bag while the fuckin moon lit [x3]

[Dylan Ross]
Might be geeking by myself
Might be one deep with my fam
If you bout it
If you bout it
Imma show you what I am
Imma show you what I do
Lie to you like Uncle Sam
Lead you to a secret place where I can treat you like a lamb
I just prey on the weak who cry out wolf the loudest but they can't
All you are to me is ants
You don't even have the chance
It's that killa that run beneath the streets
I actually am
R O Z's oh arms like Shiva if you wanted to throw them hands
bitch

[Hook: Dylan Ross]
All I ever feel is a feeling that falls under no description with no end
I think I might've caught a case
A bad bad case of the bends
