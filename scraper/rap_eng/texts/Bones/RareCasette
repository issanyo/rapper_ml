[Intro]
What? What? What?
Sesh, Bones, Dxrty, Rxdd
"What's up, homie?"
"Hey, let go twist this nigga's cap back, man"
"Yo let's do it!" (Skrrt)

[Verse 1: Dxrty Rxdd]
These pussy ass niggas always playin' Dxrty Rxdd
Like that nigga is a rookie, fuck you mean?
I made the all-star team
Call me Larry Bird, shootin' niggas bout they green
Boston Celtic-lookin' nigga blowin' hella fuckin' trees
Got them niggas' girlfriends all on the fuckin' knees
When I hop out the fuckin' goddamn black Jeep
I'm a Raider on the creep, never sleep
I peep the shit around me
Before them niggas doubt me and now them bitches like me
That shit ain't right, I don't like, I will fight
If you take my family name, lose your life
And that's the game 'til I stop

[Verse 2: Bones]
Steppin' on the scene and know I'm grippin' on that fuckin' Mac
Shootin' at your fuckin' butt, I'm creepin' up through the fuckin' back
Posted on the fuckin' tack, I'll pack the straps up in my Mac
Cock it back and let it fly, victim of a homicide
Slidin' in the fuckin' ride, take you to the other side
Stuff your body in the trunk, hit the fuckin' countryside
Drop your body in a ditch, then I'm finna hit the switch
Keep that .45 for any motherfuckers tryin' to snitch
Ridin' with the fuckin' clip, murder on my fuckin' mind
Bullet packed into my gat in case they try to blow my high
Hop out, let it fly right into the fuckin' sky
Step up on your fuckin' block
My Glock, they know the fuckin' hot
