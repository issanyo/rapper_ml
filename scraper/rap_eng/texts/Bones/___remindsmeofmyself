[Hook]
I make the drugs stretch like elastic
I call it deadboy magic
I make the dollars stretch like elastic
I call it deadboy magic

[Verse 1]
Stretch like a rubber band
Make it last like no other can
Though my life got a dirty end
Got some dope in the other hand
I'm moving and cruising
No intention of turning back
Now, back down
Smoking and rolling
I blow it off and keep going
You say you want to make money
You always thinking you hopeless
I'll do anything I can for you
I can be the end for you
Anything I can for you
I can be the end for you

[Hook]
I make the drugs stretch like elastic
I call it deadboy magic
I make the dollar stretch like elastic
I call it deadboy magic

[Outro]
Magic
Deadboy magic
Magic
Deadboy magic
