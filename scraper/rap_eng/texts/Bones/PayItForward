[Verse]
Anytime I play, it's you that your bitch ignoring
Looking like I stabbed Haley Joel Osment in Pay It Forward
Now that I’m paid like a lawyer, I'm never running out of oil
One snap of my fingers, one word from my mouth
And rent for a year is made, wait, let me show you what

[Chorus]
SESH
Even at my worst
Still kick it better than all the rest
Yes, you got it next
Well, go ahead
SESH is forever, never stress

[Verse]
SESH drip chains, glisten bad boy blunts like I'm a piston
Do you exist?
’Cause no one listen true to this shit
It's the point you missing
God mode, no clip, flying different
Lighter thumb is about to blister
Find me between dark and chipper
Call the dogs and I'mma sick 'em
Fly to shows, and come home richer
Life is funny when you live it
Death is lovely when you miss it
We all pass just like a mission
I accept it, I'm not dripping
I'm just eager to be out
Peel like the paint on the house
