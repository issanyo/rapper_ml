[Verse]
No one in the world means more to me than you
No one in the world makes me feel the way you do
No one in the world means more to me than you
No one in the word makes me feel like how you do
No one in the world, no one in the world
No one in the world, no one in the world
No one in the world makes me feel the way you do
No one in the world means more to me than you
No one in the world, no one in the world
No one in the world means more to me than you
