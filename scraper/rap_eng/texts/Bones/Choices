Aye

I Haven't seen you in a while
Hows everything doing
Do you still act wild?
Long school nights
Out party till the lights out
Girl you haven't changed, I prayed you would by now
Cause rumours Finally out, I was tryna father ya
Cause boys they always bother ya, and men they always howl at ya
I was tryna pull you up outta hell before it killed ya
Now it seems you down with the devil
And I told ya so
No way, can I go further down this road you told me to follow
I roll with the sorrow, had some pain to swallow
It had me wishing I could wake it, take it to tomorrow
The morning after cause you ain't living for that
You keep living for the drinks, started dying at the thought of that
And all I ever truly wanted was the truth, and I'm glad that you know
The one that can't speak, its you
Aye

Choice, You gotta make em
Choice, Yeah, You gotta make the right one
Choice, You gotta make em. But I ain't the one, so consider me gone

Choice, You gotta make em
Choice, Yeah, You gotta make the right one
Choice, You gotta make em. But I ain't the one, so consider me gone
