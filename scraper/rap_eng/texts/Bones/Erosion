[Hook]
I don't know the way if you ain't going with me
Could have that mask on my face; still, I know you'd know it was me
Sadness always follows, anger's fallen for me
The voices in my head wake up right when I'm falling asleep
I am eroding, I can't control it
I had a moment, now that it's gone I'm hopeless
I am eroding, I can't control it
I had a moment, now that it's gone I'm hopeless

[Verse]
Rolling hear the door ring put my dope down and I tell it now
Don't go nowhere, don't go nowhere
Smoking got me choking, got me high enough to pull it
So please, no don't go there, no don't go there
Got two blunts rolled, about to roll another
3 A.M. outside, under the moon
I know my time is coming soon
I thought everything would be better
Holding on to one thing got me hoping
I don't wanna fall tonight
Save me, can't hold on
I just thought I'd let you know

[Hook]
I don't know the way if you ain't going with me
Could have that mask on my face; still, I know you'd know it was me
Sadness always follows angers fallen for me
The voices in my head wake up right when i'm falling asleep
I am eroding, I can't control it
I had a moment, now that it's gone I'm hopeless

[Outro]
I am eroding, I can't control it
I had a moment, now that it's gone I'm hopeless
