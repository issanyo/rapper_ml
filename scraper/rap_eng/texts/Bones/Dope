[Verse 1]

Blunts get rolled graveyards get Bones
Team gets high while the bass bang low
They say they got flow but we all know the don't
They say they smoke too but we all know they don't
Team [?], pardon the initials
Flows so respected, kid disrespectful
Used to write shit, now I don't
WPOD, keep it dope
Used to write shit, now I don't
WPOD, keep it dope
