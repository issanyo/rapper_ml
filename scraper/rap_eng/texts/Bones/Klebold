[Verse]
Everybody knows that I'm
The best around they don't even know why
I look like Bret Hart mixed with Dylan Klebold
Let me wet the propane in my eye
School shooter jacket with the wood grain blade
Butterfly strapped in the sock for the prey
Waiting and debating for the time and the day
I should unleash every single plan that I made
Plan that I made why aim for the head
Every kid and teacher that ever picked on me
Grip don't squeeze
I don't want to make you bleed
But I know what a scene you have seen when I leave
Crime scene when I leave in the woods when I flee
Back to the cabin with a smile on me
Dig another cellar then I'm ready for the weather
Bitch I'm coming down you better remember just what I'm telling
Get low when you see me come round
Better get down when you hear that sound
Pipe bomb blowin' in the loud background
Lifes get's snatched 'fore your body hits ground
