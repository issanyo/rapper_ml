[Verse 1: Bones]
If the good die young, I've been dead for a minute
In the cemetery buried
Come and pay your boy a visit
All these women think I'm livin'
Till they can't feel a pulse
Ski-Skittish at thought, they fell in love with a corpse
I'm a ghost
White noise when I flow
Lights flicker, wind blowin', all the windows close
See the street lights go, with power in your home
Feel the chills up your spine, just know that it's Bones
Windows95, floppy disc when I rhyme
VHS stay glitchin', flickin' ash, sippin' wine
Digital skies, smokin' digital blunts
Got a pixelated blade break you down, roll you up
Prometh swimmin' pools, codeine bath tubs
Cristal shower running, lay Hennessy in my blood
Young fuckin' pimp, pimpin' bitches on the strip
Tryna hit without a grip, you gon' be talkin' to the clip
No, I never pull triggers and I never take a life
But I will take your girlfriend out for the night
Have her back in the morning, now she really don't want you
Pack her bags, hit the road now she goin'-goin' gone
