[Verse 1: Eddy Baker]
Real fucking shit bruh I swear my life a movie niggas wanna shoot me plus i got a lot of groupies
Came from the bottom now I'm on some other shit rapping doing shows but I still be pushing zips
Never been a thief but I still will steal your bitch [?] now she all up on my dick puffin purple clouds
Blowing circles in the whip we holding russian clips if a nigga wanna trip but we don't want that action
Just tryna be peaceful you dont wanna see eddy baker when he in beast mode 5-star suite and im chilling with some freak hoes
Blunts on deck lus you know we got doritos bands bands you know im tryna see those young ass nigga
Im just living by the G code player in the game but i ain't using cheat codes plotting on success
And im smoking like a steamboat bitch

[Chorus: Bones]
Get your dollars up (4x)
Get your money up (4x)

[Verse 2: Eddy Baker]
Crazy like Manson
Kush in the cabinet
Smoking in the mansion got dirty ass assets
Asshole since grade school even then was paid to
Sold a lot of drugs and I put that on my bro Smooth [?]  streets dont know you
Loved in my hood bitch I'm super like goku
Niggas acting brand new i just keep it old school
Been killing beats im a killer with the protools
Never been a rookie bitch i started with the pro moves
I'm a Romo mixed with Ocho in the pro bowl
Started out local but I end up global
Short motherfucker but im brave like Frodo
You ain't getting no dough
Probably getting no hoes
Goddamn nigga came up like a elevator
When you getting a buzz real shit you get hella haters
Getting to the money, so I gotta see you niggas later ho

(dialogue from the movie King Of New York)

[Chorus: Bones]
Get your dollars up (4x)
Get your money up (4x)
