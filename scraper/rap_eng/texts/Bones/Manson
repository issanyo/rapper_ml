[Intro]
People look at you today 20 years later and they still have no idea what you're about
Tell me in a sentence who you are
Nobody
I'm nobody
I'm a tramp, a bum mobile
I'm a boxcar and a jug of wine

[Verse 1]
I got long hair like the Hanson brothers
But when I flip the switch, Charles Manson coming
That Marilyn Manson bumping
The switch is sweet and I'm gutting
That TeamSESH get to thumping
The whole block get to jumping
Now my gums are numb
Too crack for yall
BONES lurking in the night
Back, backing drugs
Never backing slugs
Only packing blades
I'm never lacking brains
Lay you on you back, and you pray
I don't represent no state
I don't represent no city
I don't represent no area code
Fuck where you living
These girls say that I'm different
So these boys wanna fight
Better lock up your wife
Keep your daughter in your sight

[Hook]
It's the tribe with the high
It's the gang with the flames
It's the punks with the blunts
It's the motherfucking team
Glass in the street
Rats in the hall
Need at least 7 digits
If you tryna get a call

[Verse 2]
Bitch like Lara Croft
Tomb Raider Glocks
Pull up to the spot
Catching waves in the yacht
Bowling on top
Tennis on the bottom
Butlers bringing champagne
Me, I'm doing nada
You can keep the Louie
You can keep the Prada
Rather ride hand me downs
Whipping in Impalas
Dreaming bout Paris
Thinking bout my father
Better charge the camera
If you tryna catch the come up
Cash, money, change
Same one as Turk
Back in '98
Young thuggin' in the dirt
I'm putting in the hurt
She lifting up her skirt
She shining up my change
Then she taking off my shirt

[Hook]
It's the tribe with the high
It's the gang with the flames
It's the punks with the blunts
It's the motherfucking team
Glass in the street
Rats in the hall
Need at least 7 digits
If you tryna get a call, bitch
