(Bones)
Girls wanna fuck so these boys act tough
Got a pump in the trunk if you trying to press your luck
If you looking for the high, bitch you know I got the drugs
If you looking for connections you looking at the plug
All black clothing, locked and I'm loaded
Black 12 gauge, Columbine when I'm boomin'
Trench Coat Mafia, poppin' but never stoppin' 'em
Robbin' and mobbin' hard see there's just no toppin' 'em
You go hard but fuck it I go harder
Trying to run up slick and quick I'ma rob ya
Skin like powder, bass getting louder
Looking for a legend you can bet that you found him
I'm in the graveyard, I'm drinking champagne
I'm ashin' hella blunts, diggin' up hella graves
Troubled young man, murder on his mind
Pipebomb in his backpack, end your fucking life like BOOM
