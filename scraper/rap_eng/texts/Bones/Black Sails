[Eddy Baker]
These niggas out here wishing
They was in my position
My homies put me on game, and best believe I listen
I used to stay in detention
Frequent school suspensions
Now I'm doing these shows with my bros dodging these bitches
living out my wishes
burning trees no Christmas
You speak nobody listens
I speak I get all attention
The games a bitch but I'm pimpin'
she gon' give it up I ain't sippin
Three gold rings they glisten
I feel like Scottie Pippen
always gone my girl be missing me
But I'm out here making history
Hater niggas stay dissing me
But them niggas ain't shit to me
I'm working, straight murkin'
and that shit is for certain
[?]
It's curtains (its curtains)

[Bones]
The money come and go
gotta stay the same
I've seen your face before, but I don't know your name
I just wanna know what you do in your spare time
You don't have to tell me everything right now
I just wanna know what you do in your spare time
we can take it slow

[Xavier Wulf]
She told me all she do is ever think about me
I said listen here my dear you can't forget about me
I'm not the type to do the razzle dazzle
I'd rather clean my blade for my next battle
Wulf [Fuhrer Lord of the East Batallion]
I got black cold tears on my heart medallion
When I walk through these fools feel weak around me
You see mountain boy king water flowin' round me
Chest chain armour with the truth around it
You see blades in my teeth and hollowsquad surrounds
I don't fuck with rap niggas stay the fuck from round me
Bitch I only stand for Hollow Squad God County bitch
