(Chiiirp)
This the ingredients to the recipe
Twisting up doobies is my fucking specialty
I follow my dreams I know these things
These things are part of my destiny
Shout out to my playa niggas' out that Tennessee
All I ask is don't be skimp on the 10 a G-R-A-M
Games i don't play them
They wanna hear Chiiirp, I play ten off that killa pimp
They be bobbin they head shit I'm heaven sent
Ain't no peasant shit cause
I'm a godly figure
If you ain't upper echelon I ain't fuckin' with ya
I'm defeating ones they claim the number one contender
High intellect they don't get I'm master splinter
Teenage mutant
Ganja green like a turtle

Now we mixing colors like green and that purple
(x2)

Still both middle fingers to the cops
Legalize the weed cause ain't nobody stop
Whatever we cheifin on it's a lot
Its all fun and games 'till somebody get popped
'Till somebody get dropped
Bitch I'm 38 hott
Niggas' on my jock bitch I'm on the clock
Gotta stay on top gotta get the guap
And I ain't gone stop Till the game on lock
Yeah I'm pac yeah I'm NAS
Shit I'm anybody that you think go hard
Make a run for it cause I'm out the yard
My advice i advise you to stay on yo job
Don't come around here nosey
Talking about what we smoking
You ain't putting on this boy
So all them questions null and void

Skinny white pimp so these boyfriends hate me
Cause they girls wanna rape me
Pinky ring go bling
Singing' money ain't a thing
Chain out go 'head try to take it
Switchblade on my waist
Wrapped up in a rag
Let it shine in the light let it hit you real fast
Hair white like bleach
Style so unique
Bitch you go when i flow turn hollow when i rap
I'm smoking
I'm doping
Gotta 100 spoke rims they pokin'
Me and Chiiirp up in that old school
They see the team so they choking
We just ride around and we loakin'
We sipping on that potion
See the paint drip and its soaking
My bass loud, trunk open
