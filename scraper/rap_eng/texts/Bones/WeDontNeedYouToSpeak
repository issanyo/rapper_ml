[Verse 1]
Plugged like a motherfuking USB
Drivers updating while I'm counting up the USD
Delete the world, now these drugs just for you and me
Backspacing pussies, run upon me, boy, you will see
Escape keys can't help when you sleep
Watch as you toss and turn in your sheets
Fingers on your lips, we don't need you to speak
Rip your drive out ya spine then the mission's complete
IP's getting traced then your veins getting laced
With the finest visual tracking that this planet's got today
Turn you into a iso, ring like a light show
Battery almost dead, smoke these drugs, help my life go
