[Intro]
Cat Soup

[Verse 1]
Back on the track, grave be my fate (fate)
Quit with the tripping, bitch, not today (today)
Burnt every bridge, I don't feel no pain (pain)
What direction do you go when there is no way? (way)
Back in the snow, street hot, not safe (safe)
Speak up, lookin' like you got a lot to say (say)
Fuck around, get you shelved up, put away (away)
Step into my plot, now you locked to stay
Put you down, look at you now (now)
Yelling 'bout grippin' them pounds (pounds)
Sipping, you look like a clown (clown)
I hope you embarrassed when no one around
Put you down, look at you now (now)
Yelling 'bout grippin' them pounds (pounds)
Sipping, you look like a clown (clown)
I hope you embarrassed when no one around

[Hook]
I've been lost for I don't know how long
Walking fast, thinking slow, now you know
I've been lost for I don't know how long
Walking fast, thinking slow, now you know

[Verse 2]
Backwood packs gimme attitude
Results looking grim, I'ma have to do
We decorate the tracks, you just trash the booth
You stuck at the bottom, you ain't just passin through
Water in the glass like (SESH)
Glass tray full of ash like (SESH)
I know I'm not living right (uh)
Then again nobody is (no, no)
Only time I'm in a fight is with myself
No matter what side wins, it don't end well
Don't care about the time when shit is always hell
It's been 24 years since I felt well

[Hook]
I've been lost for I dont know how long
Walking fast, thinking slow, now you know (SESH, SESH)
I've been lost for I dont know how long
Walking fast, thinking slow, now you know
