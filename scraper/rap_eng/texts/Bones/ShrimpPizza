[Verse 1]
Bitch, when I call, pick the phone up
Hit the blunt fast then I slow up
Everybody out there got motives
When it come to you they got no love
Bitch I'm used to the sight of teens who quit life
Breathe in squeeze tight I'm gone for the night
I'm leaving for the evening
Fall with each season
Crawl with each second
My heart still barely beating
Posted in the parking lot smoking
If it ain't a backwood bust it open
I've been out here all day just hoping
That a bitch like you want a problem
When I sleep I make money that's real
You awake and can't even get a bill
When I sleep I get money that's real
You awake and can't even get a bill, bitch
It's terrible outside

[Beat Switch]

[Hook]
When I sleep I make money that's real
You awake and can't even get a bill
When I sleep I get money that's real
You awake and can't even get a bill
When I sleep I make money that's real
You awake and can't even get a bill
When I sleep I get money that's real
You awake and can't even get a bill
