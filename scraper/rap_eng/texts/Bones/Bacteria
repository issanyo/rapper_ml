[Verse 1]
Where were you when my nights were dark and cold?
Where were you when I felt all alone
Is anybody out there?
I hope that you're hearing me
I hope that you truly know
Just how much you need me
Just how much you need me

[Verse 2]
Is anybody out there?
I know that you're hearing me
I hope that you truly know me
Just how much you need me
Every night when I will call your name
I would dream just to see your face
Every night when I will call your name
I would dream just to see your face

[Hook]
I don't need a God
All I need is me
I don't need no God
All I need is me
I could never trust again (x8)

[Outro]
I could live
