[Intro]
SESH

[Hook]
4-0-0 on the dope, let it go, all my clothes smell like smoke (smoke)
1-0-0 on the wraps that we put 'em in, that's just one brick, oh (oh)

[Verse 1]
Put that on my team (team)
Dreamers of the dreams (dreams)
You and yours looking for a scheme every chance
That's why you'll never get these things (ah)
Back on the scene with a brand new attack
I showcase it to these peasants, lay 'em flat on they back
Flatline, half time, need to pick a brand new strat (ah)
Anxious to get up 'cause you grip that iron
Don't mean that you made out of metal
I'll be out the dirt just when I'm ready (when I'm ready)
Only we hold the recipe to the gift that keep banging (gift that keep banging)
The wind carry the ash to a brand new location (brand new location)
Found a place I can get away, I kick it until I'm ancient

[Hook]
4-0-0 on the dope, let it go, all my clothes smell like smoke (smoke)
1-0-0 on the wraps that we put 'em in, that's just one brick, oh
4-0-0 on the dope, let it go, all my clothes smell like smoke (smoke)
1-0-0 on the wraps that we put 'em in, that's just one brick, oh
