God damn Bo I'm in all black
They call em cowboy killers for a reason
Make sure I grab the crossbow out of the truck
Cause I'm a cold son of a bitch

[Hook]
You don't wanna be a cowboy like me (like me, like me)
You don't wanna be dyin slowly (slowly, slowly)
You don't wanna be a cowboy like me (like me, like me)
You don't wanna be hidin on the creep (2X on the creep)

[Verse 1: Bones]
Camouflage fire on, pull it like a fire alarm
Gilly suit goons, gun shots then it's tire marks
Blunts in the blind, trees with the pine
Cones on the road break it down while we drive
Now I'm creepin out the cut and I'm buckin thru the swamp
Water to my waist backwoods in my lungs
Dirt under my nails haven't showered in days
Its just me, and my blade in this world full of hate
Got a cabin in the brush on the porch rollin up
In the old rockin chair slowly sippin from my cup
No trespassin ya ribs get blasted
Skulls in the yard let you know I won't ask ya

[Hook]
You don't wanna be a cowboy like me (like me, like me)
You don't wanna be dyin slowly (slowly, slowly)
You don't wanna be a cowboy like me (like me, like me)
You don't wanna be hidin on the creep (2X on the creep)

[Verse 2: Na$ty Matt]
Riding down this old road with the windows down
Up to no good wreaking havoc on the town
Light up the marlboro take another hit
Pulled out the crossbow when i'm hittin licks
Black vans, black spurs just ridin thru the night
Gone with the wind, blendin in i'm out of sight
Take another pull while I'm buildin my coffin
If the guns don't get me it's gonna be the toxins
Can't love anybody gotta stay alone
Always on the roam, in the sticks where I call my home
Camo snipers and black nissans when I'm comin
If I hit that dusty trail best believe it ain't nothin

[Hook]
You don't wanna be a cowboy like me (like me, like me)
You don't wanna be dyin slowly (slowly, slowly)
You don't wanna be a cowboy like me (like me, like me)
You don't wanna be hidin on the creep (2X on the creep)
