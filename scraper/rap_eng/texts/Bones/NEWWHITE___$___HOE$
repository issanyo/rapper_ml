[Verse 1]
New white shoes and a clean white tee
Skinny ass kid in skinny ass jeans
Jet black hair and a fake gold chain
I like the way it looks, don't rain on my parade
Came with a team, yeah that's SESH
Blood red eyes where [?] at
Tryna get rich by the end of this set
By the end of this rap i'mma have you convinced that
Yeah I'm the best and yeah he the worst
Yeah he a star, but I'm a universe
Yeah I'm a rapper so yeah that's a verse
But really this is just how i converse
I speak in rhymes, I talk in flows
Stone from the switcher, call it rock n roll
I lock n load, you white flag
I'm Levi's, you White Stags
You reas a bitch, you dine and dash
I pay in full, pop goes the tag (pop)

[Bridge - Etta James]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

[Verse 2]
A bike ride down memory lane
No dirt road, no D-19
Just LA streets and alleyways
Gettin' homies high behind the garbage can
We SESH rats we night rats if you didn't know
Couple kids, couple girls and a couple pre rolls
Shit heads and old tunes, something from the 20s or it's no good
You peasants, we sky less
We lead the trend, you follow
I'm livin' life, I'm lovin' life, you hatin' every second
I've noticed you've been on my new white shoes since i stepped it, get to steppin'

[Bridge - Etta James]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

[Hook]
Everywhere i go what's got them staring is my new white shoes
Tryna knock me off just slip on my new white shoes
My new white shoes
My new white shoes
Find me seshin' in my new white shoes

[Outro - Etta James]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
