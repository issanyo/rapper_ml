[Hook]
You don't know where I'm from
Back in the 517, it's nothing like heaven
You don't know where I'm from
Back in the 517, it's nothing like heaven

[Verse]
You don't know me, no you don't know me
So don't act like you do
'Cause you wasn't there when we were behind the neighbor's house
Just taking apart the shed again, taking apart the shed again, taking apart

[Hook]
You don't know where I'm from
Back in the 517, it's nothing like heaven
You don't know where I'm from
Back in the 517, it's nothing like heaven
