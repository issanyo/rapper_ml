[Verse 1: Bones]
All the girls that I know are just soon to be groupies
The kids I grew up with address me as [?]
"After he moved away, everything just changed, he went Hollywood on us, that faggot said he'd never change"
Well this faggot never did, and you faggots never will, make
Anything of that life you claim to live
Probably sittin' on the couch
I'm standin' here rappin'
Talkin' 'bout how you knew me and how big of a bastard I am
Yes I am, the one they call rat boy
Take it how you want it but I left you in the past boy
Now I'm in the future
Laughin' at you pussies
With that imma get out of this town, talk but never do it
You blew it, and imma blow up
They all said grow up
So imma keep getting bigger till stretch marks show up
And Jenny Craig's fat ass is sending me texts
About sponsorship and sweepstakes for overweight kids
No I didn't mean it literally bitch stop asking me
I'm with the team, igniting green, and inhaling it fast, you see
This is the life that I chose to lead
Meaning you don't gotta like it, so if you do you can leave

[Chorus: Bones]
Jenny Craig bitch
Jenny Craig bitch

[Verse 2: Bones]
I'm going so Jenny Craig on these fat ass beats
Low sodium flow, all you can eat
So I stepped outside, and what did I see
I see RV, parked in front, waitin' for me
So I threw on my backpack and hopped on in
Got to rotating blunts till we gone with the wind
All the windows down with the sunroof open
Ridin' round LA, backseat smoking
Kid so potent, exhaling hazardous
Look like hazard lights, groovy from the cannabis
Green leaf, purple wine, scholar light, candle lit
TeamSesh, dinner lash-up for you peasants bitch
I don't wanna say nuttin' I don't mean
Imma stop right here, before I scream

[Outro: Bones]
Jenny Craig bitch
(This is the best song ever)
Jenny Craig bitch
(Jenny Craig, Jenny Craig)
(Perfect)
