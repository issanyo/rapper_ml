[Hook]
It's the creep from the creek, skeleton man, show my teeth
The whole world turn away from me, swing my hair till I RIP
I watch 'em jump, jump, jump, but they'll never get as high as us
You know that I'm sorry, never meant to do it to 'em
Fuck all that talking though, we do what we came to do
Every time it's not a surprise we fuck up the scene including you

[Verse]
Keep running after them dividends
Your whole corner made up of yes men
Convinced yourself that you're a different man
Like if I run up on you, I need different hands
Complied for bland, can't stand a chance
Save it like the last dance, just advance
Think you going ham like Vance, but you Francis Buxton
See me now, they probably say fuck him
When they get home they probably bump him
Every single day, can't get away
From the four letters, S E S H
Bathe in your hate, I drink your tears
Straight from the ducts to the cup, say cheers
Creep on the street, make it sleet when I leer
Take your vocal cords out, now they won't hear
I don't want what the rest do, I just wanna let you
Know skeleton man is on the loose and he's coming to get you

[Hook]
It's the creep from the creek, skeleton man, show my teeth
The whole world turn away from me, swing my hair till I RIP
I watch 'em jump, jump, jump, but they'll never get as high as us
You know that I'm sorry, never meant to do it to 'em
Fuck all that talking though, we do what we came to do
Every time it's not a surprise we fuck up the scene including you
