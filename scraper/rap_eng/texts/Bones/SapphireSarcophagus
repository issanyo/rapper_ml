[Verse 1: Bones]
Eyes like the moon, got a body like a tomb
If she die then I die too, bitch, I'll see you soon
Ice cold in my room, got frost on my sheets
Call me Mr. Ten Below, last thing I need is heat
If you catch me all alone, better speak up when you see me
I don't like to hold grudges, but I like to hold a beat
It's the corner store creep, black jeans, white tee
Bitch, I feel like Johnny Depp when I'm steppin' on the scene
I'm the young white hope, bitch, I'm going, going ghost
You can try 'til you die but you'll never be Bones
I been dopin' all day, flickin' ash all night
Wrinkled clothes on my body, I been dirty all my life
I don't even need a knife to cut you out of the picture
I drown in liquor, fuck a Swisher, Backwoods what I'm twistin'
I'm like the remix to Ignition, bitch, I'm better than all of you bitches
Top off the whip, I'm flickin' the switch, then I go back into the abyss
Back to the grave, life is a game
Death ain't a option, it win every day
Fuck gettin paid, fuck gettin laid
I'd rather be alone, I'm smokin' my haze
Back to the grave, life is a game
Death ain't a option, it win every day
Fuck it, it pay, fuck it, it lay
I'd rather be alone, I'm smokin' my haze

[Outro: Bones]
Walking all alone on every road I grew up on
Guess a lot of things have changed since I've been gone
Guess a lot of things have changed since I've been gone
