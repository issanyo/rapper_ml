[Intro]
What did it mean that he was dead? Where had he gone? It was like a hole, in reality, had opened up and swallowed him. But then the really shocking question occurred to me: If he could die, could it happen to me too? Could that hole, in reality, open up and swallow me? Would it open up beneath my bed and swallow me as I slept?

[Verse 1]
Sesh
If this was on cinema this a five bagger
Young turkington working it you just the actor
But since you the opposite you are now obligated
To ride out this unfortunate consequence
I be on top of it, you, you look out of it
Step back and see that you trash and no doubting it
Hope that you saving some sheckles and counting it
Cause truth of the matter is you ain't gonna last long
Cause we around streets get shut down when we in town
It's funny when  I  zoom out look at what we do now
Fuck it zoom in gotta get back to the groove now
No time to look back or think about the math
When you dictate the future the present and the past
101 passed zero blunts out the bag
M-59 scumbag still tryna scrap
Started out in the warehouse just like Tony Hawk
Pro Skater now we on the stage of the theatre
I light up when lights hit my white skin turn demon
My eyes turn to ash and fall out of my sockets
The razor appear slowly out of my pocket
Saliva drippin out my mouth burn the carpet
The carpenter here to show you to your coffin
I put the nail in and I bang bang
These rappers they sayin the same thang
Crack you a seal then you pop you a aid
Till you high enough to think you killin the game
Bitch I don't come from a place where they drank
Hail from the place where that rag to your face
Wanna get high then you find you a ride
And you siphon it dry till you blue in the face
Think that you gone till I take you back home
Under the bridge where the mold goes to grow
Don't crawl on fos boy we crawl on all fours
Siphon through trash turn to cash in our palms
I don't see you on the radar at all
So it's kinda funny that you wanna talk
About making noise, you don't see the point
There is nothing your brain could produce I'd enjoy

[Outro]
Imagine the book of your life, its covers, its beginning and end, and your birth and your death. You can only know the moments in between, the moments that make up your life. It makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers, whether before your birth or after your death
