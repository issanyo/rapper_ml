[Hook]
I delete you then creep, will you ever see me?
No, it's damn near impossible
Can't call me, beep me if you wanna reach me
I ain't Kim Possible
I delete you then creep will you ever see me?
No, it's damn near impossible
Like trying to sleep while you in the street
Because you made a vow you would watch the moon

[Verse]
I don't got a lot of time so I'll keep it short
I step in like poppa's home
Kids, it's time to take down them forts
Because all I'm seeing is a mess now
I think it's best if you step down
Heard a little voice that said my set loud
Fuck everybody else, it's all about SESH now
You can have later but now it's about us, I said
You can have later but now it's about us

[Hook]
I delete you then creep, will you ever see me?
No, it's damn near impossible
Can't call me, beep me if you wanna reach me
I ain't Kim Possible
I delete you then creep will you ever see me?
No, it's damn near impossible
Like trying to sleep while you in the street
Because you made a vow you would watch the moon
