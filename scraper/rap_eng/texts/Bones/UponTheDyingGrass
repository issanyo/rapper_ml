[Verse 1]
Upon the dying grass, under the overpass
Where I'd catch my breath
I don't need the road I've taped it out, I'm on a different station
Thoughts of you is what helps me now, when I'm feeling complications

[Hook]
I love the thought that we were all just infants, new to life and so helpless in an instant
I love the thought that we were all just infants, new to life and so helpless in an instant

[Verse 2]
He was a man who found salvation, Living amongst the sea
Fell aboard, and washed  ashore, because the tide took me
Little sticks in shapes of letters, in hopes that they will see
Once they see the lightning, they're the ones that sail away
