[Intro]
Hehehe, Misogi

[Verse 1: Bones]
I can make them all shiver
See, I could make them all cold
I could turn the heat on up and watch them thaw and be gone
But you know that I've yet to do it
When I do, you will know when I lose it

[Pre-Hook]
N-n-n-no, n-n-n-no
Bitch, I don't think so
N-n-n-no, n-n-n-no
Bitch, I don't think so
N-n-n-no, n-n-n-no
Bitch, I don't think so
N-n-n-no, n-n-n-no
(know I've been waiting yeah)

[Hook]
You know I've been waiting
You know I've been waiting right here
Death is my haven
I am the raven's nightmare
Heard what they saying
Something about it ain't right here
Know I've been waiting
Know I've been waiting
Know I've been waiting right here
Death is my haven
I am the raven's nightmare
Heard what they saying
Something about it ain't right here
Know I've been waiting

[Bridge]
Bitch you know I'll make it go
Bitch you know I'll make it go
Bitch you know I'll make it go
Bitch you know I'll make it go

[Pre-Hook]
N-n-n-no, n-n-n-no
Bitch, I don't think so
N-n-n-no, n-n-n-no
Bitch, I don't think so
N-n-n-no, n-n-n-no
Bitch, I don't think so
N-n-n-no, n-n-n-no

[Hook]
Know I've been waiting
You know I've been waiting right here
Death is my haven
I am the raven's nightmare
Heard what they saying
Something about it ain't right here
Know I've been waiting

[Outro]
You know I've been waiting
You know I've been waiting right here
Death is my haven
I am the raven's nightmare
Heard what they saying
Something about it ain't right here
You know I've been waiting
