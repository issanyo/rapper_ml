[Intro: Project Pat]
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
Break out the
Break out the
Break out the
Break, break, break
Break out the
Break out the
Break out the

Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
Break out the
Break out the
Break out the

Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
Break out the

Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
Break out the

Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you

[Verse]
Ski mask and a Glock
Run up in your spot
My parents taught me well so where the fuck did I go wrong
What the fuck I got to lose
Shoot 'em up that's kinda rude
Rather smoke a blunt and kick a rap but what am I gonna do
I'ma stick 'em up quick and the ricochet doesn't hit a man down shots fired now I'm runnin' through the kitchen
Bookin' it through the garden sorry bitch I beg your pardon
Killin' all your daffodils and kickin' up all your flowers
I put it down for the kids who fuckin' can't
The kids who hate school but parents won't let 'em fail
Tell 'em I say fuck you and everything that they believe
That's rude as shit but that's just me if you don't like it leave
I got some tricks right here up my fuckin' sleeve
Mask-like Halloween
Automatic weapons under my bed just tryna sleep
Let it leap up out the sheets
Rip some holes in your knees
Now you goin' out like Tony face down in the deep

[Outro: Project Pat]
Break out the
Break out the
Break out the
Break out the
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
Break out the
Break out the
Break out the
Break out the
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
