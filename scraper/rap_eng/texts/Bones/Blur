[Verse]
I forever say the shit that got 'em jumping
I'm the one, ain't no other, so it's nothing
To make the whole world stop
Don't speak just watch
You are now in the presence of the ruckus
Passed on from a far, I'm a blur
Vague shape, dead eyes, let 'em learn
Light a match to my corpse, let me burn
Then brush it all in a transparent urn
Let them see in the end how you turn
From whatever you convinced yourself that you were
How could you hate, how could you judge
Another being seeing as we all just dust
Fuck what you think now, fuck what you thought
Look me in the eyes, not a player, I’m a bot
Level 101, HP to the top, all slots equipped, I’m sharp to the touch

[Hook]
Pull the blinds and I'm sitting in your driveway
No pulse, not a sound, just smiling
48's on shine just for my sake
TeamSESH forever till the day that time breaks
Pull the blinds and I'm sitting in your driveway
No pulse, not a sound, just smiling
48's on shine just for my sake
TeamSESH forever till the day that time breaks
