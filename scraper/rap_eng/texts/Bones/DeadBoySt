[Verse]
While the pimps and the pushers were swerving in the Caddy
I was in the alley with the fiends and the addicts
Every single day they itching out a habit
Grooving through the atlas, move wherever it be cracking
Crooks on the corner selling heaven in a bag
Promises the halos if you come correct with cash
I don't know it all but please take it from me, boy
Don't mess around on DeadBoySt

[Hook]
You will never leave DeadBoySt
Once you overseen you know what it be

[Skit]
Yo Bunas
Yo Bunus
Yo Bryce
Yo Bunas
Aye dude wake up
What's up man
Bones I got this track, you gotta hear it
Lemme hear what you got

[Outro]
Lemme hear what you got
