[Verse]
Hit the dope, then I go like Otto Rocket
We do it large, they Polly Pocket
Venue never big enough for the block
It's hard to stop, I could never slow up
Up against a white wall I don't show up
Ask about interests, I know none
But breathing every day some way or another
The dash to the grave is the one I fell in love with
Lay my corpse down, but don't you dare weep
When its time for me to sleep, wrap me up in organic sheets
Light me, give the world heat
When I'm gone, look at me as meat, feed me to the animals
In terms of doing, it's the least I could do after all

[Outro]
We never gave a fuck about them
So why would they give a fuck about us?
We never gave a fuck about them
