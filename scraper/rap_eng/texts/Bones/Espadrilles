[Intro]
"I do 50 push ups every night and it's not a sexual thing it's just push up's really"
"you are pulling at strings now"
"how many do you do a night"
"I do 50, I do a night"
"put that in the pipe and smoke it"
"I do not smoke"
"Shut up! your wife is harassing me now"
"C'mon man"

[Verse]
Keep my hands in my pockets
My words to myself and just keep this shit moving
The world can just do what they want
Shut they eyes say your prayer to the useless
Just like a human, get it then lose it
Converse about doin' but never go do it
I'm nothing special
More worthless than ever
100 woods now I'm deader
I could never be better.

[Pre-Hook]
Everything different
And I'm the one to blame
Soon everything distant
I don't want to feel this way
Everything different
And I'm the one to blame
Soon everything distant
I don't want to feel this way

[Hook]
I shut out the world and I do what I do while I'm here
Nobody near the same when I look in the mirror
Seshin still
Espadrilles lifted with some drugs lit
Boomin like a drumkit
These other teams don't want shit

[Outro]
And that's a promise
And that's a promise
And that's a promise
And that's a promise
And that's a promise
And that's a promise
I know, I know
