[Intro: Bones]
SESH
Ride around town with that money on me
Ride around town with that money on me

[Verse: Bones]
She got a bad drug problem and she want me to solve it
She know I got work, in the back of the 'Rari
She say I'm charming, I say I'm not
She say she fallin', deep in love
I tried to warn her, she wouldn't listen
She eat prescriptions, now she fuckin' trippin'
She lyin' on me, she dyin' on me
I check her pulse, just to make sure that she fuckin' breathing
She a fuckin' mess, I'm a fuckin' legend
I don't deserve this shit, she don't deserve that necklace
She livin' young and reckless, I wish I never met her
2 million in the box, 25 thousand missing
She say she bought some clothes, I know she bought some blow
I see it in her eyes, I see it on her nose
Oh, Bones knows, bitch Bones knows
Don't you try and fuck around with a lost soul
