[Verse]
Where were you when my world was burning down
You say you'd be here but you're nowhere to be found
Nowhere to be found except in my memories
I hope you cannot breath every time that you think of me
I'm walking all alone down the road that I used to go
I'm looking all around, I see faces that I don't know

[Outro]
Take me away
Cut off my circulation
I don't want to be here if you're not
Cut off my circulation
I don't want to be here if you're not
