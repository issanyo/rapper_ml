What
What
Like rappers, she overdosed on my mattress
I flip the bed
None of my bitches like rappers, she overdosed on my mattress
That death metal stay blasting
What
Yeah
Bones

[Verse 1: Bones]
None of my bitches like rappers (nope)
She overdosed on my mattress (dead)
That death metal stay blasting (blast)
She dying slow, it's so tragic (fuck it)
I flip the bed, I burn the sheets (what?)
Leave the blood and I burn my weed
Pop a pill, she dying slow
She so high, those eyes gone
Half asleep and she half awake
Doing drugs, she don't even eat
Dinner time, she passed her plate
She popped an X, she fucking me
The sight of me, she bow down to me
Floating high above the balcony
Too high, she don't even breath
She pass away, and resurrect for me (SESH)
My bitch ride like a Model T
That's till the motherfucking wheels fall off
Rapping cause I know how to piss you all off
Ima take your first love if you lookin' at me wrong
Stage, you're a face from the crowd, I'm the man
Comin' round with the shit gettin' locked in the bed
Lost in the woods, burn it down to the ground
No shirt hair down, somewhere in your town
So high, I'm ain't never coming down, coming down
So high, I'm ain't never coming down, coming down, coming down
(None of my bitches like rappers, she overdosed on my mattress)
This is why I'm hot, and this is why I'm hot

[Hook: Bones]
None of my bitches like rappers (nope)
She overdosed on my mattress (die)
That death metal stay blasting (fuck)
She dying slow, it's so tragic
None of my bitches like rappers (nope)
She overdosed on my mattress (die)
That death metal stay blasting (huh?)
She dying slow, it's so tragic (what?)

Bones
Sesh, Sesh, Sesh
