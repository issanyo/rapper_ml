[Verse 1]
Blunts got me stuck can't move
Too many times I played the fool
I like the way the light hit my jewels
Bumping unreleased shit in unreleased shoes
White devil watch me give the world the blues
Analyze my ways watch every move
Never bang then tell us just how you do
They never change same through and through

[Chorus]
In the dead of the night my flaws always wake me up
You say that you're alright, I hope you're not making it up
In the dead of the night my flaws always wake me up
You say that you're alright, I hope you're not making it up

[Verse 2]
SESH
Patek on your arm like its hard work
Blade against your face do your blood work
Motherfuck your crew do you all dirt
100 to the face now I'm okay
Think you something special bitch no way
The day you see my face thats a cold case
Diamonds dripping wet now I'm soaking
Don't gotta say my name because they know me

[Chorus]
In the dead of the night my flaws always wake me up
You say that you're alright, I hope you're not making it up
In the dead of the night my flaws always wake me up
You say that you're alright, I hope you're not making it up
