[Verse]
Shave my head, change my name, and run away
Anything that will take the attention away from me now what's that say
I don't give a fuck 'bout the fame
That's the last thing I wanted to gain
Been a minute since we spoke, still i'm turning to a ghost
I can feel it everyday

See the ash flow down like snow
In the ditch by the old backroad
I never had money to throw
Never see me in the club with hoes
See the outside world is a backdrop
That you'll never see Bones in front of
Rot, let me rot, let me rot away
Cut the blinds, kill the lights, let me fade away
As I lie up on my back and tap the comforter I say
Things will never be the same
Really?
