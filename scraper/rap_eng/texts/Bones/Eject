[Intro]
SESH

[Hook]
Couldn't he do it how we do it?
That's something you'll never know
Couldn't he do it how we do it?
Go and sell out every show
Get shit thumpin', get 'em all jumpin'
Do whatever you got to do
Still they never do
What they do for us for you

[Verse]
You say you pour a four in a styrofoam
Leanin' now you feelin' right at home
One or two cups, now your eyes are gone
You say you hate the man but you helpin' him
You still a resident, just as irrelevant
Drinkin' up all of his medicine
Talkin' that bullshit like you really think it
Preach about poison then pour up and drink it
Fuck are you thinkin'?

[Hook]
Do it how we do it?
That's something you'll never know
Couldn't he do it how we do it?
Go and sell out every show
Get shit thumpin' and get 'em all jumpin'
Do whatever you got to do
Still they never do
What they do for us for you
