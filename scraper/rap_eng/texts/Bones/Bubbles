[Verse 1: Bones]
As I watched him drown
I remember the sound of bubbles being broken
As I feel the ground start to separate
And I'm fallin' into the open
I'm at the edge of the world
I'm 'bout to walk right off it
Now I'm talkin' to myself again
I just wanna stop it

[Hook]
Rollin' and rollin' and rollin' on
Rollin' and rollin' and rollin' on
Rollin' and rollin' and rollin' on
Rollin' and rollin' and rollin' on
