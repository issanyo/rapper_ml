[Verse 1: Bones]
Been on the surface so long
And we still can't get it right
Tell me what is going on?
The most elaborate joke ever told
And we remain the punchline till we all ghost
We all pay the price
Just by waking up to fall asleep every night
Sometimes life never seems to get it right
Shut both eyes and somehow I feel alright

[Pre-Hook: Sosi]
I've been
Silent
For so
Long
Keep it
Quiet
To stay
Alone, oh

[Hook: Bones]
Now we are all machines
Humans are the proof that the prey turns beast
We are all the roots at the bottom of the trees
Underneath the leaves, silently plant seeds
