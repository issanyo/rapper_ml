[Hook]
I ain't tryin' to be white, I ain't tryin' to be black
I ain't tryin'  to be the best, I did it on accident
I ain't tryin' to be white, I ain't tryin' to be black
I ain't even tryin' to act, I ain't even tryin' to rap

[Verse]
If I did you would know, if I did it would show
No sweat, no check, bitch it's all that I know
I could flow, I could go, I could bring it back slow
I could make you stop rapping with the fucking video
Know itâ€™s SESH when you see the VHS start glitchin'
Still the Skinny White Pimp, I'm just sick of all the bitchin'
Promo till you go but you still never blow
You ain't good you ain't hood, you ain't 'bout what you talk
Man the fuck up, bitch, make some motherfucking noise
Just because you got a microphone don't mean you going hard
Just because you hit record doesn't mean you made a song
All your shit sounds like mine, just a bad version
Right now you just a pussy online tryna push it
Stop wasting all your time, should've listened to your mom
When she told you get a job, fuck it, maybe you already do
But stay the fuck up off the mic until you're fucking ready to

[Hook]
I ain't tryin' to be white, I ain't tryin' to be black
I ain't tryin'  to be the best, I did it on accident
I ain't tryin' to be white, I ain't tryin' to be black
I ain't even tryin' to act, I ain't even tryin' to rap
