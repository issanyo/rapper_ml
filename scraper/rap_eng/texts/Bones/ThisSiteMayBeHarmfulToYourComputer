[Verse]
Even if I sit here calmly
They don't know what to call me
Everybody has their off days
But I think I have them more than others
My mind's become a bother
I get cold like I got no covers
On the back of the breeze like a leaf
I go wherever the wind blow
I love the places they don't go I see the faces that don't show
They say they know but not what I know
I know they don't, I'm sure

[Hook]
Mr. car alarm
Don't step too close
Mr. car alarm
Don't step too close

[Outro]
This ain't the first this ain't the last
I ain't the worst I ain't the baddest one
I ain't the baddest one..
