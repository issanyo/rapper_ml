[Verse]
Been a freak since Creep
Still a man from down the street
That they do not wanna meet, show my teeth and leave you weak
I don't need no breeze, I don't need no sun
I don't need no money, I don't need no one
Bitch, my time has just been begun, none that I've done can't get redone
Talking them guns like they for fun
Where I'm from they lose the young
Hunting rifles in the kitchen, foam cooler in the truck
They get fucked up and bang, like they time is almost up
Drink click-clack, then they drop you down
Think it's cute, think they making new sounds
Got paid, and they think they're cool now
But that's obligatory, nothing new now

[Pre-Hook]
Used to this shit
Thinking you hard, I've got news for you bitch
You're new to this shit
Reaching for me and you're losing a limb
Bitch, I'm used to this shit

[Hook]
Rewind, eject, send it back
On a hill with a Map in my lap
Trace roads with my finger, where they at
Walk the world like I woke up just like that
From this far down, they look just like ants
So far from my home, I stand
Insignificance, in-admission when I see the roads at first glance
