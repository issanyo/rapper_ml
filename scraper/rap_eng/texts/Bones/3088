Jet pack on my back
Laser beam on my waist
All chrome everything like its 3088
Fresh fruit up on my plate
Vintage shades on my eyes
Motherfuck your whole life
Motherfuck your 9 to 5
Flying cars in the skies
Robots in the kitchen
Space cubes in my drink
Hologram chain glistens
French doors on my rooms
Penthouse on the moon
Blowing smoke in my zone
Stardust on my shoes
Asteroids in my ring, meteorites up in my chain
I'ma fucking universe when my shit go bling
White tee
Looking like a franchise boy
But its SESH till I rest
Bringin that fuckin white noise

On the big dipper sippin mixing honey with my team
Wake up in a nebula fall asleep in a galaxy
Who's ever after me promise they won't compare to me
Money, drugs, diamonds; all that shit just ain't a thing to me
Lasers, beams, hologram rings
3088 when I'm stepping on the scene
Lasers, beams, hologram rings
It's 3088 Bones stepping up on the scene
Like
SESH
