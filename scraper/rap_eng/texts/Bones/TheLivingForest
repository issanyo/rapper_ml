Johnny Cage, black shades
Call me Stryker when I spray
Yung Baraka with the blade, Reptile with the fangs
Sub-zero with my ice, Nightwolf in the night
Ermac when I fight, from the forest, taking life
Shao Khan, out the game, Liu kang with the kick
Flow, no name, no body, no face
Just drugs, just bass, just rap, just face
I'm the lord of the underworld with the gold chain
Money in your face while you getting none today
Money rules all, I got some up in the safe
Run up at the bank, put the weapon on safety (BRRRAP)
Mick fully masked with a bitch like Sable
Bentley coupe crashin', blunts I'm cashin'
Lovin' every second, bitch, why you lookin' mad?
Corduroy house shoes, bitch it's like that
Writing these lyrics is like cashing these fucking cheques

I'm bouncin', bouncin', one million ounces
Sleeping in the trunk 'nother mill up at the house, bitch
You on the couch shit, never get out shit
I'm on the rap shit, getting money rapping

(Let me ride to the beat (x5))
