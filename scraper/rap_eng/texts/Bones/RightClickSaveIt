[Intro]
What? What?

[Verse]
Privet, bitch, kak dela?
Tell the reaper, hurry up, like arriba
The Terminator of the game, like "I'll be back"
I did whatever it took to, never a 9 to 5
No, don't you lie, no, don't you cry
Light the fuse and I'll blow like the 4th of July
You will comply, or I will supply your life
With such pain that is hard to describe
I am hard to define I'm rather off in design
Hate life to the point there ain't shit I desire
Said you would pull up on me
But you have yet to come by
Injected with lies, infected with rhymes
What is it that you do, come and please remind
I'm the type of machine that put you in rewind
Bring you back to the very first time
You have ever felt fear running down your spine

[Chorus]
Bitch, don't say shit
Right click, save it
I gotta vanquish
Hope you think I ain't shit
Bitch, don't say shit
Right click, save it
I gotta vanquish
Hope you think I ain't shit
