[Verse 1]
Young boy used to drown in that alcohol
And if you dialing, 517 before you fucking call
I'm bout to hold K2 to my fuckin jaws
When waking up and gettin cash was a fuckin chore
Aluminum pay so we packin up the fuckin car
Cold nights, Tanqueray up in the fuckin jar
Ride, slide, feel the ice up on the fuckin road
White jeep, white trash, white fuckin snow
I remember everything like last year was yesterday
Use to sell the rupture funds and make that money anyway
Then we knew how they won't ever find out how we did these things, that's just how it went down

[Hook]
Tables by the stack, thumb tacs by the pack
Gasoline with the rag, it went way beyond the mat
Tables by the stack, thumb tacs by the pack
Gasoline with the rag, it went way beyond the mat
