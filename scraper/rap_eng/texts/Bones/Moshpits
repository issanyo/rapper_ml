[Verse 1: Xavier Wulf]
I don't give a shit about shit
But my clique and that's it
Hollow squad captain, nigga fuck the bullshit
Talk shit and get hit if you feel like it, bitch
Fuck nigga, yeah you know it's me, Wulfgang, killer till the E-N-D when I D-I-E
Find me in your sleep, till you D-I-E
Fuck with me and never rest in peace, bitch
Hanakasumi
Always all up on me
Plot on me and be harmed
I don't give no warnings
I'll cut you dead and go home
Then I'll smoke all night long
I told my squad to prolong
We got war in the morning

[Hook: Xavier Wulf]
Mosh pits in the club
Fuck with me, I'll fuck you up
Mosh pits in the club
Fuck with me, I'll fuck you up
Mosh pits in the club
Fuck with me, I'll fuck you up
Mosh pits in the club
Fuck with me, I'll fuck you up
Mosh pits in the club
Fuck with me, I'll fuck you up
Mosh pits in the club
Fuck with me, I'll fuck you up
Mosh pits in the club
Fuck with me, I'll fuck you up
Mosh pits in the club
Fuck with me, I'll fuck you up

[Verse 2: Bones]
You could never fuck with me
You could never run from me
Blood up on my switchblade
Riding up your fucking street
Riding up your fucking street
I don't need no fucking heat
I don't need a fucking Glock to take away your fucking dreams
You could never take my life
Bitch, cus' I'm already dead
Always with my brothers
Try to run up, lose your fucking head
Blood up on the floor
I hear ghosts knocking at my door
I hear screams from the past
Just ignore them and keep on going, bitch

[Bridge: Bones]
You could never fuck with me
You could never fuck with me
Blood up on my switchblade
Riding up your fucking street
You could never fuck with me
You could never fuck with me
Blood up on my switchblade
Riding up your fucking street

[Outro: Bones]
What, what
Sesh, Bones
What, what
What, sesh
