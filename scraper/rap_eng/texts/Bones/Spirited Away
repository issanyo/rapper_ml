[Bones Vocals]
(Wait)
No glock in my drawers
No crack in my drawers
I ain't running from the law, no,
no
Bitch I'm sitting in the hall,
smoking blunts, thinking bout it all
Water on ice,
just chilling
Sitting back, watching,
smoke hits the ceilling
Floating out the door like a motherfucking ghost
Razor blade flicking, now you know it's fucking Bones

[Beamon Intro To Vocals]
Serving murder, it's every time I'm serving

[Beamon Vocals]
Serving punishment, I do this every time I'm bored
I'm depressed with everything that's in my life, bitch what's that for?
My legs dangle off the edge, I brought swim trunks in case I fall
Watch my body hit the water, just to fill my hp up
We can't do no exp share, no it's not enough
We can't do no exp share, no it's not enough
I left spirits on the floor,
Beam pick em up
Let my hair go down my back I walk and trip on it
Spirits on the floor, watch me wake up in the bath house
Put my blade away, but since you came here,
brought it back out
Spirits on the floor, watch me wake up in the bath house
Put my blade away, but since you came here,
brought it back out
