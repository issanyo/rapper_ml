ShaveMyHeadChangeMyName, by Bones

[Verse]
Shave my head, change my name, and run away
Anything that will take the attention away from me, now what's that say?
I don't give a fuck 'bout the fame, that's the last thing I wanted to gain
Been a minute since we spoke, still I'm turning to a ghost, I can feel it everyday
See the ash flow down like snow
In the ditch, by the old backroad
I never had money to throw
Never see me in the club with hoes
See, the outside world is a backdrop that you'll never see Bones in front of
Rot, let me rot, let me rot away
Cut the blinds, kill the lights, let me fade away
As I lie up on my back and turn turn the comforter 'til I say
Things will never be the same
Really?

WhyDon'tYouJustGiveMeTheBag?, by Bones

[Intro]
Why don't you just give me the bag?
Give you the bag?
Sir, would you mind telling me what's going on here?
Chrissy, I'll handle this
Fellas, you seem to want this bag pretty bad

[Verse]
Pink lemonade shoes, roll raspberry blunts
While you out here getting stressed bet I'm home getting buck
Side up when we buck, SESH never gave a fuck
Holding out both hands but you'll never get a buck
When your album gon' flop they gon' say it's dumb luck
Ain't nobody wanna own up to the fact that shit suck
Begone lil men, begone lil boys
Ain't no place for wannabes, this the level with the noise
Sidewalk talk, it's the avenue thought
No crease in my jeans, no wallet, no watch
Place in the trees, breeze blowing to the east
Inhale what I got then I disappear with ease
My legs get weak when the Backwoods cheap
Two hearts in my eyes, smile cheek to fucking cheek

[Hook]
Fruits on the trees, bag of Flax Seed
Juice on the ground, spitting pits in the weeds
Fruits on the trees, bag of Flax Seed
Juice on the ground, spitting pits in the weeds

Well guys, it was a very sad day in Sports today. I don't... I'm not gonna throw names or anything like that, but we had some... we had some people, you know, cheating, tarnishing the good name that is baseball and, umm, we're just not gonna stand for that. So... I hope these people... I really, I want more names to be brought, brought out into the light because I will not stand, I will not rest until this is done with, alright?

Hey there, this is Chip Kipperly, we're gonna check in with our brand new intern, Lyle the intern, at the Uncle Ricky Fun Run Sesh For The Cure. Lyle, what's up?
