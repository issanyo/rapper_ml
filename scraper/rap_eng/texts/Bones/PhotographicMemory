I want nobody, I'm feeding on you
[?] know what we do
I'm not smoking [baby?], without you
You're on my mind and, baby, I gotta go

Hope you know it's night when I look at the window
Sippin', drinking juice and smoking indo
Smoke dope, that's forever
Smoke dope, that's forever

Looking at the stars
Wondering where you are
You are, you are, you are
You are my heart

Your hair, falls down
Almost so gracefully
Never forget you
Bless my photographic memory
Bless my photographic memory
Bless my photographic memory

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
