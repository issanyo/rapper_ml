[Intro]
Spacedtime

[Verse]
The streets that I grew up on is probably changed by now
The house that I grew up in is owned by somebody that I don't know
The places that I used to go
You cannot see them
They are covered in snow

[Hook]
Covered in snow
Covered in snow
Covered in snow
Covered in snow

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
