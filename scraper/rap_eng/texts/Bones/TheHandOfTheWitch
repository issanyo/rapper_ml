[Intro]
"Apparently when he was getting his hay…
And he was getting it, I suppose, where he shouldn’t be getting it maybe…
But uh… he heard a banshee…
And he dropped everything and ran home and he was as white as a sheet and he was frightened of the light and he got an awful fright, but like…
And somebody in the area… somebody be known to him had died…
Upon the night never has it so happened. Now, Believe it or not, it could be anything…"

[Hook]
What it is
What it is
I say the word and its over
Fuck what they told ya
What it is
What it is
The best in the world
Don't care what you heard bitch
What it is
What it is
Fuck is the problem
Got em we solve em
I'm the resolver
Show up end all em
Mind fadin off so I gotta get rollin

[Verse]
Motions fluid like oceans
Got em' out wonderin' what's the commotion
Look all they see a corpse is smokin'
Til I turn BONES and show them who own it
How does he pick up the world and just mold it
Almost as of it ain't nothin' to hold it
Shit, now I want it
But she can't have it
Shit is too fragile
No one can hold it but me and I'm glad too
Sittin' in the backyard smokin' new dope
While you wonder why your work don't work
You can work til it hurt then they lower you in dirt
Then I kill your whole discog, just one verse
People hate fakes so the people hate you
The word got out now your friends hate too
Water level risin', only thing you can do
Let your lungs fill with the fluid, yes
