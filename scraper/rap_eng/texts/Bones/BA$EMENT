[Intro]
Basement life
Christmas lights
Gin with Sprite
Wine on ice
Short list of the things that I like
It's funny how drunk nights describe life
Feel my lines
Hear my rhymes
Recycling bottles, we on the wintertime grind
Savin' up bucks to get wintertime drunk
Phones on silent, lets have fun

[Verse 1]
Run in garage
Chillin' in the rush
Ice was gone
Somebody run to the store
Get a big thing of cubes and a six pack of Dew, see we do real big
I wish you'd get a clue
Just teenagers, sub woof bangin'
Cops knock on the door, quiet 'till they leavin'
Now turn it up, that all the neighbors hearin'
Pals started talkin', the girls started hearin'
The ways that the young do [?]
That's party all the time first week day two
Sixtel new, get up that Dew
Whatever we did last night, times two
Skip school, act foolish like kids do
Run 'em up through town then go back to
The basement, come and stay the night
I'd like to welcome y'all to the times of my life

[Verse 2]
I ain't losin' friends, but I be losing sleep
In the garage at night screamin' lyrics to that shit
[?], pouring out my soul, trying to balance my composure, but I can't do it alone
I need my gang with me
I see what things'll be
For the dope-ass kids from scrap nation
From off the [?], turn it back again
I need some space
I say, I need some time
I got my foot in the door, and I got money on my mind
Because I, I'm steady racin' in the marathon
I'm steady, pushin' my way off the bar
I'm steady, dreaming, oh I'm steady dreamin'
I can show everybody what I be California Dreamin'

[Hook]
I came from the basement, grew up in the basement
Tanqueray on shallow days, feelin' like we made it
I be in the basement
I wish that you could face it
The picture's out of focus, but the image never fading

[Verse 4]
See, y'all trying to do what we already done
So no matter what, you just a re-run
Yo, click rewind, hit me twice, we can settle what you said, you ain't consider me tight
I'm a K2-kid on my K2-shit
Take me into your lungs, I'ma let loose bitch with the loose cannons
Runnin' town like errands
When we shot at, we shot back like Terrance
We was the ones that made the past
Gave a [?] the liter and guess who was dead last
Y'all was in the bag, who was first class?
When I see [?], half full glass
But you was still mad, plannin' your attack
Made 'cause we had somethin' you'll never have
Tally, creativity, just imaginin' a world without us is like ones without the magic
Stars, planets, worlds collide
Then the red lights on and the Kid goes live
Time flies when you truly alive
I'd like to welcome y'all to the times of my life


[Hook]
I came from the basement, grew up in the basement
Tanqueray on shallow days, feelin' like we made it
I be in the basement
I wish that you could face it
The picture's out of focus, but the image never fading
Welcome to the basement
[?] with the basement
Welcome to the basement
I'm feelin' like we made it
Welcome to the basement
