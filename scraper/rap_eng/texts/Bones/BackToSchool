[Verse]
My heart hurts, my back aches, I'm calling out for you
I see you, I need you more than you ever knew
I wanna know, 'cause we both been hurt before
Why your answer's no when I say, "I love you"
My heart hurts, my back aches, I'm calling out for you
I see you, I need you more than you ever knew
I wanna know, 'cause we both been hurt before
Why your answer's no when I say, "I love you, more"?
