[Verse 1: Bones]
Purified water in my glass, let me hydrate
Young white trash, eyes low like I'm 5'8"
Ground starts to vibrate, grass starts to separate
Soil starts to plumb into the core of my fucking grave
Diamonds in my eyes, I got jewels on me
Get your body lifted if you try to fool on me
But just know I ain't alone, just know I ain't alone
Got a hundred scumbags that'll kill just for Bones
Lookin' like you seen a ghost when you're looking at me
Body full of chemicals so it's hard for me to breathe
Hard drive saved, Macintosh, bitches say I'm actin' posh
Say I'm not thirsty if the water ain't a fuckin' Voss

[Outro: Bones]
I will ride 'til the day that I die
I will ride 'til the day that I die
