[Chorus]
Snap your fingers (snap your fingers), twist a blunt (twist a blunt)
I can do this shit as much as I want (ah-ah)
Bitch what (bitch what), get stomped (get stomped)
I feel like Young Buck, black denim, beige lugs (beige lugs)
30 rolled up (up), pull up pop trunk (trunk)
Dropped what I was told, started doin' what I want (want)
Now my life serene (-rene), I simply can't explain (-plain)
It never gets old wakin' up to your dreams
What

[Verse 1]
Used to have to roll up on my washer (on my washer)
But since the upgrade I got options (I got options)
Now I got like 13 rooms that I could gut in (I could gut in)
Like I might just roll up in the walk-in closet
Vintage painted tile line the hallways (yeah)
Hand chiseled moldin' on the fireplace
Neighbors see me and they get scared (get scared)
'Cause I sure don't look like I belong here

[Chorus]
Snap your fingers (snap your fingers), twist a blunt (twist a blunt)
I can do this shit as much as I want (ah-ah)
Bitch what (bitch what), get stomped (get stomped)
I feel like Young Buck, black denim, beige lugs (beige lugs)
30 rolled up (up), pull up pop trunk (trunk)
Dropped what I was told, started doin' what I want (want)
Now my life serene (-rene), I simply can't explain (-plain)
It never gets old wakin' up to your dreams
Snap your fingers (snap your fingers), twist a blunt (twist a blunt)
I can do this shit as much as I want (ah-ah)
Bitch what (bitch what), get stomped (get stomped)
I feel like Young Buck, black denim, beige lugs
Snap your fingers, twist a blunt

[Outro]
