Hello? Who's There?

Who's that in the tree?
Who's that Who's that in the tree?
Who's that in the tree?

[Verse 1 - Justin Roiland - Lil Tree Guy]
Fuck you get out of my house
Yo I'm a little tree guy, you're, you're gonna get the fuck out of here
This is my little tree world (world)
Just get outta here
It's tree world
It's my place
It's my little home (My home)
Y-y-y I live up in a hole up in a tree
Hey-yy push to the top of the day
Ladiasdka nd egenigts asbfhjksd
As diyu jksdf dashj efhjd
Ashb dnjk iho, get out of here!
Talkin' bout, talkin' bout, tree world!
Livin' in it, livin' in it jumpin' in it cruisin' in it
Servin' in it,  lbebet coppin' it
I'm a little tree with a baby!
This is my tree world!
I drive drink four loko!
Put it in a little juicy-juice cup!
I'm just a little boopy loop
I-I was*Cough*

[Chorus - ?]
Who's that in the tree?
Who's that Who's that in the tree?
Who's that in the tree?
Who's that Who's that in the tree?
Who's that in the tree?
Who's that Who's that in the tree?
Who's that in the tree?
Who's that Who's that in the tree?

[Verse 2 - Casper]
Since I was a seed
Dogs been pissin' on me
Kids rippin' limbs off and we
Get killed for shit magazines
Or for beds, and doors
Sheds and floors
Every force down in Ecuador
To my mans that got cut, planned and chopped up
Every day I pour resin for him
Not tree guy, more obnoxious than bee-hives
Cussin' fussin' no sleep time
Think I'm evicting his behind, no peace sign
It used to rule to be me
But now I'm down 2k17
Even the woods that raised me since a baby need a cooling machine
He's like "Get outta my world" I'm like "Get outta me!
Take that yada yada down the strada, leave me to be"
All I need, a breeze in my leaves, some badgers and bats
The struggle never ends
Until they put an axe in my back
That's on my set

[Chorus - ? & BONES]
Who's that in the tree?
Who's that Who's that in the tree?
Who's that in the tree?
Who's that Who's that in the tree?
Who's that in the tree?
Who's that Who's that in the tree?
(what)
Who's that in the tree?
Who's that in the tree?
(What, What)
(What, What)
(What, What)
(What, What)

[Verse 3 - BONES]
Leaves break from the trees
Riding the breeze all the way down to me
Green all that I see, all that I breathe
It's always astounding to me
Creepin' through the forest always knowing
There's a chance I won't make it to the morning
BONES never sit still, always moving, like
I think it's about time I get going
I see you through the leaves when you think no one is watching
I see you through the leaves when you think no one is watching
(wait)
I see you through the leaves when you think no one is watching
I see you through the leaves when you think no one is watching
(What, What)
