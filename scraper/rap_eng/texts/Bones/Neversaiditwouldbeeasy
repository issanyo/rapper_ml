[Verse]
You never said it would be easy, yeah that's the truth
I'm falling deeper and deeper into my tomb
I'm holding on, it's not easy but these hands will do
I'm slipping, my grip is different without you
My blood is cold when you look down
I overthink, to a fault
Yes I know, I'm to blame
And It shows
You can read it in my face
You can hear it when I dream
There is something just not right with anything I perceive

[Hook]
You're the one thing that I could never change
You're the one thing that I could never change
You're the one thing that I could never change
You're the one thing that I could never change

[Bridge]
I want to tell myself it's not too late
But time is passing I don't think I can change

[Hook]
You're the one thing that I could never change
You're the one thing that I could never change
You're the one thing that I could never change
You're the one thing that I could never change

[Outro]
Where do we go, I do not know
Other than far far away
Am I in love, I do not know
And it's lying far asleep
Where do we go, I do not know
Other than far far away
Am I in love, I do not know
And it's lying far asleep
(What)
Where do we go, I do not know
Other than far far away
Am I in love, I do not know
And it's lying far asleep
