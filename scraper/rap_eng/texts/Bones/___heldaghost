[Verse]
I've held a ghost
And it slipped through my fingertips
I've lost all hope
I want nothing to do with this

[Pre-Hook]
If we don't leave
We will burn with this town

[Hook]
If everything was everything
I would never have to worry about anything
I've held a ghost
And it slipped through my fingertips

[Outro]
"And I worry about you
And I worry about you
I don't know why you're doing it but it's not good and it's not healthy- it's not right. Not that I'm saying you don't have it together, I'm sure you do. You're a genius, you really are. You're a genius"
"I know"
