[INTRO: Th@ Kid Mumbling]
Sometimes it's so hard to be so famous
I mean i'm so famous

[INTRO]
I'm famous, famous, bitch i'm famous
Cameras flashin', females faintin'
Famous, famous, bitch i'm famous
Got a lot of money so i gotta go spend it

[VERSE: Th@ Kid]
Ridin 'round the city like a big shot
In a shirt i've found at the thrift shop
Fuck hip-hop, let the fuckin' kid rock
Wrist watch, tick-tock, 2, 1, lift off
I've waited my whole fuckin' life to be where I am tonight
In the hollywood hills ownin' hundred dollar bills
Passin' out, wakin' up and catchin' flights
Money in my hand, i'm 'bout to throw it all
Ounce in the bag and i'm 'bout to blow it all
Hardcore flow, smackdown vs raw
Tabloids gossip, blunts get sparked
Everybody knows i'm the fuckin' kid
Dropped outta school then i fuckin' got rich
Somethin' always lit, turned up, let me spit
The bass goes bang and the lighter goes flick

[OUTRO x2]
I'm famous, famous, bitch i'm famous
Cameras flashin', females faintin'
Famous, famous, bitch i'm famous
Got a lot of money so i gotta go spend it
