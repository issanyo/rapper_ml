[Pre-Hook]
Lemme see that blunt, lemme see that cup
Lemme see that liquor, lemme see those drugs
I need a high, I need it bad
I need it fast, I'm fiendin' bad

[Hook]
(Fiendin', fiendin') I'm fiendin' bad
(Fiendin', fiendin') I'm fiendin' bad
(Fiendin', fiendin') I'm fiendin' bad
(Fiendin', fiendin') I'm fiendin' bad

[Verse]
Waking up, rolling up
Fall asleep while I'm doping up
Home alone, hold the phone
If I die, no one would know
If I try to keep holding on, maybe they'll think I'm a legend then (shit)
Maybe they'll think I'm a legend then
Maybe they'll think I'm a legend then
Waking up, rolling up
Fall asleep while I'm doping up
Home alone, hold the phone
If I die, no one would know
If I try to keep holding on, maybe they'll think I'm a legend then (shit)
Maybe they'll think I'm a legend then
Maybe they'll think I'm a legend then
