[Hook: Bones]
Back again with somethin' new to hate
Back with another style to take
These labels runnin' outta ideas quick
So they studying my moves, but they won't find shit
Back again with somethin' new to hate
Back with another style to take
These labels runnin' outta ideas quick
So they studying my moves, but they won't find shit

[Verse 1: Bones]
Making this money quick, and I don't even want it
Running a mile with your style but it's stolen
Too many offers, inbox still loadin'
They acting touchy, but they know I never want 'em
They see the team, they see the shows, and now they want it
I never sell them what I know you can't stomach
So get the fuck up out the way, cause we the only ones that does it
Bitch I'm fresh off tour, while your ticket sales strugglin'

[Hook: Bones]
Back again with somethin' new to hate
Back with another style to take
These labels runnin' outta ideas quick
So they studying my moves, but they won't find shit

[Verse 2: Bones]
Running to fuck 'em up, while you lingering on the cusp of quittin'
You say you finished cause they just won't listen
Take five steps back, sit down just watch
I'm the physical result of doing what they said not

[Outro]
Keep your eyes on me, keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me, keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me, keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me, keep your eyes on me
