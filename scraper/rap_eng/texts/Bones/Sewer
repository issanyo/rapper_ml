[Verse: Bones]
Your name is like a bullet, pull the trigger, take my life (life)
Your voice is like a switchblade slash in the night (night)
My life is like a knife (knife), my knife is like a secret (secret)
She open up and she break your heart, you wish that you would've seen it (seen it)
Your boyfriend wanna be me (be me), I've seen him and denied (denied)
You seen him and you frown (frown), you seen me and you smile (smile)
I don't even fuckin' rap (rap), I think fuckin' out loud
I got drugs up in my system, take a year to flush them out (out)
I smoke way too many blunts (blunts), I drink way too much liquor (liquor)
That's Hennessy with that Tanqueray, I chase that with a Swisher (Swisher)
I'm gripping on my issue (issue), you praying that it miss you (miss you)
I see you on my map, I'm finna blast and erase you
I roll up and I take her (take her), I take her back to my sewer (SESH)
I'm drippin' now, she trippin' now
See, underground I'm a ruler (Bones)
I don't ride around with no Ruger, I don't ride around with no Mac
Never catch me poppin' no gats, I'd rather sesh, yeah
