[Verse]
Oh brother you've helped me, in more ways than one
I wish I could speak the words
To tell you what you've done
For my life, for my life, for my life
And for you I will bring the moon down from the sky, from the sky
Right where you came from, an angel in disguise
Brother, brother, you have never turned
I could never learn how to be like you, be like you
You are everything I could ever dream to be
Dream to be, dream to be, dream to be

[Hook]
Wake me before you go
Wait for me, just wait for me
Wake me before you go
Wait for me, just wait for me
