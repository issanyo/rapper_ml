[Hook]
Money in my sock, I got money in my sock
I got money in my sock, I got money in my sock

[Verse 1]
Money in my sock when you see me in the street (street)
No I don't got much, but I got my blade so don't test me (test me)
I'm just tryna live, don't you try to fucking stop me, I'll never hurt a soul but I will if you try me (try me)
I'm Riding, Riding, I'm Riding

[Verse 2]
Poison in my veins, everybody know my name
So everybody know my face, cuz they see me on the screen
They hear me then they scream, Bones on the creep
2am, in the middle of the night
I be smoking in the middle of the street
I got money in my sock, love in my heart
Drugs in my blunt, got a match and i'm about to spark

[Hook]
Money in my sock, I got money in my sock
I got money in my sock, I got money in my sock
Money in my sock, money in my sock
Money in my sock, I got money in my sock
