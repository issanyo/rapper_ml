[Hook]
Sleep like a freak and I eat like a animal
Step up to the team, that's something you ain't ready for
Wake up in a dying world, looking like the antidote
Heard you talking down, let me see where the anna go

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's just like that
Thinking they creative 'cause they ass can rap
Chris said get back
Pussy boy take a lap, you don't really want that
As I post up at the house
Looking out the window, blowing smoke, laying down
I cut back to the scene from the past
Used to sell it stone cold when we used to break glass
Never saw the teacher so I never missed math
Never went to school so I never ditched class

[Hook]
Sleep like a freak and I eat like a animal
Step up to the team, that's something you ain't ready for
Wake up in a dying world, looking like the antidote
Heard you talking down, let me see where the anna go
