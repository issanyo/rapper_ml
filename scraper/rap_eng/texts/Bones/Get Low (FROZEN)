[Intro: Xavier Wulf]
Rollin' up slow, kush smoke with the big bro
Play me, boy, better get looooow

[Hook: Xavier Wulf]
Rollin' up slow, kush smoke with the big bro
Play me, boy, better get low, ho
I ain't finna play games with him, hell no
I'm a man, him too, so I treat him like so
Nigga, I know you's a ho, nigga
Don't try to hide, you fool, I already know
A nigga like me ain't finna play, no way
Smoke a blunt, chill, no nigga, high all day

[Verse 1: Xavier Wulf]
Smokin' blowin' every type of goddamn reefer
My brothers smokin' halves for no particular reason
We used to skip class for that bad bitch sativa
I'm workin' for my cash and that's the only damn reason
My nigga, I'm a player, hustle for the damn season
I'm posted with the set, chillin', buckin' like a heathen
And we don't give a fuck and that's the goddamn reason
Her weed smoke thick, I call her Queen A-Lacheefay
Your chick call me, for that pussy be the reason
Baby girl high, now she want to take a beating
So I'ma let her slide, I'mma keep her for the weekend
But when I give her back she might act like she don't need it

[Hook x2: Xavier Wulf]

[Outro: Xavier Wulf]
Rollin' up slow, kush smoke with the big brooo
