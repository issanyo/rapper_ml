[Verse 1: Bones]
Colder than the snow, stuck to telegraph road
Shitty like the people from the place we call home
Midwest scum, whole yard full of mud
Deers hangin' in the garages, pavement covered in dried up blood
Just trying it out
Born with the hate, now just trying it out
A regular guest, now we riding it out
Say what you want, but we 'bout what we 'bout
No lying around
Scrapping the meadow, we silent now
Winter come down, now we hide it out
Lying about
You're killing the game, you said that your whole shit is lame

[Hook: Bones]
We will be here till the reaper
Cross over the field just to see us
And even when that go I'm sitting right back up to open my eyes and I see you
We will be here till the reaper
Cross over the field just to see us
And even when that go I'm sitting right back up to open my eyes and I see you

[Post-Hook: Bones]
We're in a beautiful place
And we don't want to see your face
No, we don't like your taste
So walk the fuck out of the way
We're in a beautiful place
And we don't want to see your face
No, we don't like your taste
So walk the fuck out of the way

[Outro: Bones]
We will be right here till the reaper comes down
And pays us a visit
We will be right here till the reaper comes down
And pays us a visit
