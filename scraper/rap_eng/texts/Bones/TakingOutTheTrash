[Hook]
The rest of the game got me going "ha" like Juvie
Since I dropped the block been hot, no cooling
Rent flexing, spreading, stunting fake jewelry
No those ain't diamonds never me that you foolin'

[Verse 1]
It's 1997
Rock like Stairway To Heaven
I be at the top waitin'
Like somebody double dared me
When you never did it before
Sometimes it's funny when you fo-cus on the people you know
Watch them react as you grow
Shit will never get old to me
I'm ingrained in the program you see
Even when I go, I don't leave
When I stop breathin I'll still be right here
Turn around if you need me
Some words, some company
Still got that blade under me
Layin' down but no, I don't sleep
My eyes open, hopin' someone notice
I am the only one
Awake when they ain't but
That's something that can't be done
If no one's around to hear it
Do it ever truly happen?
Says who? Light the blunt
Flick the ash and say exactly

[Verse 2]
I don't pop Xanax because pills are for pussies
Never scared of being human
I ain't 'fraid of feeling feelings
Got that anger, got that razor
Careful, do not run into it
With the team smokin' mean
I just hope we run into ya (wait)
Nobody special, that's me
Cut off your flow, now you got gangrene
You hit the floor like they got that beam
But I don't need a bullet to leave 'em dead at the scene
I conquer, stompin', mobbin', proper
Made my own world like J.K. Rowling
Sesh never stop while the rest stay stallin
Ever since we started every day, it get larger

[Hook]
The rest of the game got me going "ha" like Juvie
Since I dropped the block been hot, no cooling
Rent flexing, spreading, stunting fake jewelry
No those ain't diamonds never me that you foolin'

[Outro]
I don't think for a second
That you know what you're doing
I don't think for a second
That you know what you're doing
When you are an individual
You're young, you make shitty rap music, you take pills
You're going to have the body of a geriatric patient
By the time you're fucking twenty-five
It's gonna be fucking hilarious
I don't wanna know what you think
I don't wanna know what you think
I don't wanna know what you think
