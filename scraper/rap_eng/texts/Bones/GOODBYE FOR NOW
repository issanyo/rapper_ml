[Verse 1]
Watch me waste away, oh, so gracefully
Have your morals, have your thoughts
But preach them tastefully
The moon remains when I'm awake
It's like it waits for me
And then I see you and I know this is the place for me
I know it's silly, maybe immature but thankfully
My anxiety surrounds me by what's safe to me
(what's safe to me, what's safe to me, what's safe to me)

[Verse 2]
Hated my life and the town I was in
Nobody knew me I went with the wind
Way back in school I was doing the same
Keeping my head down
Don't look in my face

[Outro] x2
Goodbye for now
