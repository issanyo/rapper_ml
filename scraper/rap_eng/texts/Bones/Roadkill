[Verse]
Flashbacks of coming up they hit me like a tow truck
Feeling too much like even the moon got a motive
Sometimes when you look around you might see no one
Till you get in motion and now they wanna know you
I wish I could say that I'm surprised
I wish I could say it's not on my mind
Ctrl alt delete it disappear then come back creeping
Hardly seen but every season SESH create a whole new scenery
If you don't believe in me hope you stay tuned to see
The cosmos working I'm the nothing that is everything

[Hook]
I don't hope and I don't dream
I just watch as life happens for me
I don't hope and I don't dream
I just watch as life lives through me
I don't hope and I don't dream
I just watch as life happens for me
I don't hope and I don't dream
I just watch as life lives through me

[Outro]
I don't hope
I don't dream
