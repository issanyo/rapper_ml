I was a young boy in seventh grade
got an invitation to a skate park with my friend
I love skating
I love the fat skateboard shoes then, still do now
So I said yes
went to the damn skate park
dropped in on the ramp
everything was cool
started off real nice
real smooth
went to the bowl
Oh no!
went to drop in
looked at my friend
I said I got this
I'm going in
set it up
deep breath
here we go
1-2-3 and ooh
crash
face
to the rail
fuck
my chipped tooth
was born

straight through the lip had to get stitches too
Momma was so mad still made me go to school
I said fuck
they gon' get me
she said well you should have been careful
and that's how I got my chipped tooth man
I got a cap on it now you feel me
know what I mean dental work
good dental work
shouts out to my dentist
there it is
alot of you guys wanted to know about that
I'm glad I finally got that one off my chest
there ya go
end scene

Here's a real good one
He was a boy
he lied to his schoolmates
He was new in town it was second grade
Unfortunately, he told the schoolmates he had a baby alligator
they figured out I was lying
they made fun of me a little bit
but I wouldn't really know I uh I didn't go to lunch
I hid in the bathroom for like a month straight every lunch period
cause I was afraid of uh admitting that I lied
and thats why I'm such a piece of shit human

(Xavier Wulf)
There ya have it guys
Two real stories
It's true
His is true
Mine is true

(Bones)
I said I had a real alligator
I told everybody I had an alligator named Bubbles
I lied I'm sorry
