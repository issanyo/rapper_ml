Turn the lights down, just vibe to this shit
You ain't gotta send respect, just pay mind to this shit

I'm feeling like I'm on to some shit with every beat that I rip, with every lyric that I spit
The young kid's getting it; a legend in the making
But what makes a legend legendary if you're fucking faking it
Easy rather taking it, the shoes are looking vacant
So Im climbing power lines just to see if I can fit in 'em
I ain't got stripes to earn and pass the rituals
Shit is just a bitchual by now, I thought you knew
I thought you knew
The kid at school that you thought you knew
I thought you knew
The kid at school that you thought you knew
