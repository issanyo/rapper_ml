[Verse]
Sending client info Bones logging on
Shift + Tab hit the dope till I'm barely holding on
Ping low never glitch, funds low never bitch
I just work this shit like magic, TeamSESH could show you tricks
Ain't nobody use to listen when I use to twist them sticks
I was broker than broke, blunt full of holes
It would never stay lit, but still I would spend
Minutes and hours and days and weeks
Working like I would get paid to speak
It's all that I need, but all my shit free
While you B-Tunnel camping, bitch I'm site A planting
Too late to defuse me your shit already been banished
Quit the "acting like you better"
Quick to catch the arm and hammer
Swing the gavel hit the gravel
We create our own level

[Outro:]
So go on boy go and act like you're something
But i know what you are
So go on boy go and tell everybody
That you are just like us
But you're not so just stop that
