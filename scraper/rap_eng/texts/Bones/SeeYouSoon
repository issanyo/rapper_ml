[Hook]
If I see you boy, I hope you've got a problem with me
Because it's hate I want to show you, it revolves within me
It never ends it never stops it just goes..
If you ask around, nobody knows..
But that ain't gonna stop it there
No, I'm not looking for apologies..
They say they don't know what to do
But me, I've always fuckin' knew..

[Verse 1]
Deep down, nobody has a cause..
Unless you want one..
I know that that's a hard, pill to swallow..
I've never been one to give good advice..
So I suggest you leave my times..
Alone...
Alone...
