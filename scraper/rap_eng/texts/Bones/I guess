[Verse]
And I guess that's how life goes
Live a long life then turn to a ghost
It's a one way road
Take a million turns still end up home
Now your body cold
Memories play like motion pictures
Now you oughta to know
This ain't what I depicted
Were placed then taken away from our loved ones
Live from the place where money is more important
Planet earth
What is it worth
The inhabitants ruin everything
There is no break in this chain
All we want is everything
And everything is induced with pain
Induced with pain
Induced with pain
Induced with pain
Induced with pain

[Outro]
They still don't know
They think it's alright
They still don't know
They think it's all just a lie
They still don't know
They think it's alright
They still don't know
They think it's all just a lie
