[Verse]
No weapon on my side but I'm still down to ride
Know I stay up for mine forever vertically spine'd
Don't look to me for kindness if you recite me lies
I will cite you with these fines make you pay up every time
I know I say some mean shit but I mean every line
I know I do that scream shit
But I don't wear no mask to hide my face
When I'm out walking down the streets at night

[Hook]
What?
Up in the alleyway
What?
I ain't ever gonna leave
No
Up in the alleyway
What?
I ain't ever gonna leave
No
Up in the alleyway
What?
I ain't ever gonna leave
No
Up in the alleyway
What?
I ain't ever gonna leave
No
