[Verse]
This game ain't for me
My reflection aim for me
My only competition's me, so myself I bully
I stay up late working
My lady wait up for me
You do it for a check, like where the waiter, hurry
I do it for my life, it's the only place I flourish
I'm aiming at your loved ones if you run up on me
Team Sesh an army
You never harming nothing
Stick to the books kid, go to Harvard something
Bones a farmer man, now watch me harvest something
No script you better stick to yours like drama something
That money came quick, almost too fast
While you struggling with the weight like slim fast
Bitch
