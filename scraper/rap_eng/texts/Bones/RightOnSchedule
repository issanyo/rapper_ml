[Verse 1]
Everyday
I get so cashed I don’t notice I’m breathing still, hey
I'm the white nightmare I’m the proof that dreams are real, wait
Saw me then there's no question they see me still, hey
Don’t act like a stranger my angle of dangers real
The king of the dead, the lord of the graves
The lower the sun, the colder the shade
It's hardest to tame the waves in my brain
The riot inside me is breaking the cage
Unleash your rage, still I’m standing unfazed
I promise you won’t bat a lash in my face
No matter how many shows ever sell out
I will ditch it mid set to show you what I mean

[Bridge]
And you'll never get my confirmation
They get inspired then shun the inspiration
I'm feeling like I'm on another planet
I use to creep all night just like a bandit

[Pre-Hook]
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go

[Hook]
Know I put on, put on, put on every time
Know I put on, put on, put on every night
Know I put on, put on, put on every time
Know I put on, put on, put on every night
Came along way, you do it the wrong way
We do it the right way, every night, hey
Came along way, you do it the wrong way
We do it the right way, every night, hey
