[Verse 1]
The last thing I'm fucking worried about it
Is how it will end
Deaths an opponent
That never loses no matter how you defend
You can try your best
You can give it your all
Look the reaper in the face
Show 'em just how man you are

[Hook]
Get the fuck out
I don't really like you much
Get the fuck out
I don't really like you much
Get the fuck out
I don't really like you much
Get the fuck out
I don't really like you much

[Verse 2]
Over the hills and through the woods
In hopes of us finding a river
My feet have been numb and my body is fucked
And I'm starving and cold so I shiver
In the distance a voice from afar
Said that we cannot go on
Embarrassment stopped me from screaming
But I have to tell 'em just look where we are
The pain in the road has become us
And now we are living here with the result
The lightning is calling out
Behind darkened clouds
So I think that it's time that we go
The wheels are falling apart
My heart, it hurts when it's dark
I know there's a slim chance
We will wake up tomorrow at all
So I trudge through the rock

[Hook]
Get the fuck out
I don't really like you much
Get the fuck out
I don't really like you much
Get the fuck out
I don't really like you much
Get the fuck out
I don't really like you much
