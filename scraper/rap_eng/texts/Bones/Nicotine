[Intro]
SESH

[Verse 1: Bones]
So so SESH now
Feeling like Bow Wow
Bitches know it's Bones so they bounce with me now now
Blunt gut god nicotine on the ground ground
Doing all the talkin' me I don't make a sound
Pitch black back roads
Ice on the asphalt
Steal for a meal
Hit the blunt and I pass out
Tanqueray spillin' on my pants
As I stumble out the jungle
With some bloody vines wrapped around my numbers
We were 15, so of course we didn't think
For we broke inside that bitch and took the whole fucking thing
See when that boy gets back, best believe he'll be lost
Everything to his name now gone for the cause
Anyway I can get, best believe that I'll do it
Bitch I take em' break em' shake em' like there ain't nothin' to it
I'm coming through, no mask on
Hair down my back long
No rubber gloves till the cops get their track on
Do it

[Verse 2: Na$ty Matt]
Nicotine in my lungs
A million reds to the face
12 Slugs in my mouth
12 roses on my grave
Blood stains on my [?]
[?] around my waist
[?] to the face
But that's [?]
A roll them stumps serving candy like Halloween
Aborted babies in the toilet never to be seen
I'm twisted like dreadlocks
Been bucking out wedlocks
Make a bitch bend over and bust that ass open like X-Pac
I note, your girl swears she gained a hoe
But I keep that face painted like a Juggalo
Riding in the photo, grippin' on the 44'
You prayin' I die slow, but I'm so so
SESH till I rest but I'm pretty sure I felt my death
Pretty sure I took my last breath now I'm possessed
Welcome to the graveyard where them deadboys lay
And we grip on them things, like everyday
