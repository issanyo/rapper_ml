[Intro]
That would be great

[Hook]
Never thought about it, but when you say it like that
All of the gears they start to spin in my head
Never understood why they all acting like that
But I guess I do know that you said it like that
You can go out, I think I'll stay in instead
So with that said, don't ask me how we did it
"You're a genius, you really are. You're a genius"
"I know"
Never thought about it, but when you say it like that
All of the gears they start to spin in my head
Never understood why they all acting like that
But I guess I do know that you said it like that
You can go out, I think I'll stay in instead
So with that said, don't ask me how we did it

[Outro]
I think I'm gonna stay right here
Give a fuck about no one, no one
I think I'm gonna stay right here
Give a fuck about no one, no one
