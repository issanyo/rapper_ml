[Verse]
White gloves in my black trench coat
White noise on the television glowing
If Earth could talk it'd look to us and tell us go
You don’t need a telescope to see what's wrong

[Pre-Hook]
I don’t mind the weather outside
When it gets dark and cold
I don’t mind the weather outside
When it gets dark and cold

[Hook]
It's great when it's sunny but it's better when it rains
In so many ways
It's great when it's sunny but it's better when it rains
In so many ways (what?)

[Post-Hook]
I’m gone for the night, I’m takin it off
Off into the night, I’m takin off
I’m gone for the night, I’m takin it off
Off into the night, I’m takin off

[Outro]
