[Verse]
People always talk about my come up
'Cause I've been going hard every summer
Pussy wanna talk about numbers
But you manage to buy them, that's why your shows so bummy
Ain't nobody out now that can touch us
Cut you boys down if you run up
Acting like you hard with your gun up
But if it ever drop then your ass get to running and running
I'm too cashed when you see me
Already seen with no TV
Already paid with no CD
Why you try to sell MP3's?
Just bought some dope cause I know that we low
My money is up, so the drugs never slow
Smoke 'til I go then I'm off to the store
Brick of the woods with some water to pour
When we ride, ride slow up in them lanes, bitch
Bones take your favorite rapper out the game, bitch
White trash, I could never ever change, bitch
Still the skinny white pimp with the black blade, bitch
