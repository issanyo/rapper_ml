[Verse: Bones]
I was looking for someone and I thought it was you
I've been waiting for some time, waiting here for you
But I haven't seen any fucking body
So I guess that I'll just sit in my room and wait
I don't need anybody's love
I don't need anybody's words
I think I'll be okay on my own now
I think it's best if I go now...

[Outro]
You think you'll miss me but I promise you won't
You think you love me but you know that you don't
