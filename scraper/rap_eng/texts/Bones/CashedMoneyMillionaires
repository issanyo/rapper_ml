[Verse 1]
Hoe in the back, got a hoe in the front
One cooking the crack, one rolling the blunt
It's easy, easy, bitch don't believe me
I'm riding through your city bumping Cash Money, Weezy
El says get 'em, J I got 'em
Me plus the beat, that's a motherfucking problem
Swerving pilots, thinking never stop them
They can set shots but they can never drop them
Yeah, they got money and I know they got hoes
I know they got whips and all the designer clothes
But do they have a sewer full of rats that'll crack fucking bats
To the back of these crackers and fucking laugh
MAC-10 attack, it's the AK to spray
I'm the beef in the night, I'm the thug in the day
I'm the drugs in the blunt, I'm the light in the flame
I'm the sickest you ever witness, I'm sick of fucking saying
I'm saying

[Hook]
I'm doing fucking drugs and getting real famous
I'm doing lot of drugs and I'm getting real famous
You waking up early just to drag that ass to work
Same shit everyday until you're in the dirt
