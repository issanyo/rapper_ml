[Hook]
Even if there's not a problem I would probably overthink it
Til' there is, is, is, is
Alright when it gets night
But when it's bright I see this life for just what it is, is, is, is
Feeling like my body light enough to lift up, sighting's heighten
Then I turn back into mist
Tectonics under pressure, hands holding onto weapons
Yelling, "do away with the men"

[Verse]
Skeletons dropping like Geronimo
See we just animals
But dialect can't justify what is critical
It goes beyond words
I'm out and onwards
Above the young herds
Their screams I overheard

[Hook]
Even if there's not a problem I would probably overthink it
Til' there is, is, is, is
Alright when it gets night
But when it's bright I see this life for just what it is, is, is, is
Feeling like my body light enough to lift up, sighting's heighten
Then I turn back into mist
Tectonics under pressure, hands holding onto weapons
Yelling, "do away with the men" (yo)

[Bridge]
They be wondering where I be at (yo)
Boy, I'm somewhere that you'll never get (yo)
They be wondering where I be at (yo)
Boy, I'm somewhere that you'll never get
