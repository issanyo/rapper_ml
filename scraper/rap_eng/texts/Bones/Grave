[Verse 1]
No trap phone, no Glock 9
I don't move bricks, I don't stop time
I don't push keys, I don't got time
I hope you got your knife, because I got mine
I don't fuck bitches, I don't pimp dimes
I don't chop rock, I'm never due time
I'm way too smart to even cross the line
I never finish school, but just look at me now

[Hook]
Never paid attention, never did detention
Free clothes, free drugs, is now what I'm getting
Never paid attention, never did detention
Free clothes, free drugs, is now what I'm getting

[Outro]
What, what, what, SESH
Bones
What, what, what, what, what
