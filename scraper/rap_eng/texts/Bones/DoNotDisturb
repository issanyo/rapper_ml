[Verse 1]
What's it gonna be, like Janet and Busta?
Not trying to impress you, just don't wanna press you
You know it's no pressure
When it's me and you it's auto connection
I made my life hectic, I'm used to the stressing
Without you I'm cold but with you convected

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 2]
What?
Trying to live a modern life like Rocco
Please don't disturb, swerve strangers like potholes
Had to take it further, I ain't settling for condos
Had the secret sauce so I blew up like mondo burger
Earn it, watch to fuckin learn it
I don't think im hot, I just know the dope burning
Like it never did, so that should say something
3 years ago, smoking stems in abundance

[Hook]
Brick wall, waterfall, mirror mirror on the wall
Who fucking got it all? SESH, yes
Brick wall, waterfall, mirror mirror on the wall
Who fucking got it all? BONES, yes
