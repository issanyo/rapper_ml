[Intro]
Ready come on, come on now

[Hook]
Raining on the cold windows
There's many ways the wind may blow
There's many things that I would like you to know
I'll forever do whatever that it takes to know

[Verse 1]
I will do whatever for you
I will sleep forever for you
I will do whatever for you
I will sleep forever for you

[Hook]
Raining on the cold windows
There's many ways the wind may blow
There's many things that I would like you to know
I'll forever do whatever that it takes to know

[Verse 2]
You know that I will
Tell you everything I feel
You know that I will
Tell you everything I feel
You know darling
You know darling
You know darling
You know darling

[Outro]
I see your face, I feel your pulse
I know I'm alive cause I can feel your hands in mine
