[Intro]
What?
Bones
Sesh
What?
Yeah
What?

[Verse]
No lean in your cup, (cup) no weed in your blunt (blunt)
So she going home with Bones, say she want me to feed her drugs
Young Backstreet Boy, please don't give your girl a choice (no)
First I give her 100 pills, then she turn into a corpse (what?)
Blade on my waist when you see me on the stage (SESH)
Try to run up talking down, I will take your life away (what?)
Baby look me in my eyes, I could never tell a lie
I'ma always keep you safe, please just put your hands in mine (huh)

[Pre-Hook]
Ride with me, ride with me, I need to know
Will you die with me, die with me? Just let me know
Till we both turn ghost and our bones disappear
Tell me that you really love me, I just really need to hear it (SESH)
Ride with me, ride with me, I need to know
Will you die with me, die with me? Just let me know
Till we both turn ghost and our bones disappear
Tell me that you really love me, I just really need to hear it (what?)

[Hook]
I'll be right here (right), if you need me (me)
If you need me (me), if you need me (what)
I'll be right here (Bones), if you need me
If you need me, if you need me (SESH)

[Outro]
Yeah
What
