[Verse]
Only when it stops
We will be able to see
Its the light in the dark
That's always meant the most to me
Only when we stop
Will we be able to breathe
Cuz every breath is carcinogen filled
I don't think that's what we need
I don't think its right
All we do is play with life
Then again who gives a fuck what I have to say (I have to say)
I'm just a dot on another little speck floating all through space

[Hook]
Every little thing you've ever dreamed
Every little thing you've ever seen
It's living all through you
It's running through your veins
I see it in your face
I hear it in your speech
I know that life gets weak
