[Verse 1]
Riding in the car, not knowing where we are
Wonder where you are, when you're oh so far
Sun goes down and the nights get cold
I hope you're okay, I just wanna come back home
I can't sleep without you here
I can't breathe without you near
Lot of things I wanna say
Just know that I love you every day

[Hook]
Love you every day
Just know that you're everything to me
Love you every day
Just know that you're everything to me
I could love you every day
Just know that you're everything to me

[Verse 2]
Rollin' a back, hundred bitches on my lap
In the coke white caddy, it's the young white mack
Tryna jack, turn back, razor blade on my lap
Put the steel to your cap then be ghost in a flash, like
Turn off the lights, I'm coming home
I don't wanna see you all alone
I don't like to hear your pain, girl
I just wanna feed you drugs, girl

[Hook]
Love you every day
Just know that you're everything to me
Love you every day
Just know that you're everything to me
