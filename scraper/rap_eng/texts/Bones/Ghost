[Intro: XXXTENTACION]
My flesh is cold as a ghost
My flesh is cold as a ghost
My flesh is cold as a ghost
My flesh is....
My flesh is cold as a ghost
My flesh is cold as a ghost
My flesh is cold as a ghost

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
And I, could’ve been
Next fall, next blade in the king
Bleed red, four doors in the Benz
But I met four ghosts in the pen
And I, could’ve been
Dead, boy, my soul is amiss
Flushed skin, X types of a kiss
Rather hate, bitch
Just face the abyss, and I (aye!)
Place blame for this shit
Rather be dead, dull blades on my wrist, wrist
Fucking with my head, get dead, that’s the gist
Flushed, you can see it on me, I'm pissed, pissed
Lost in the mist, pants full of piss
Pick a daffodilly, so pretty at this
Fist fuck, started feeling, silly willy, take a look
At the rope, then he jumped
All he needed was a brick, brick

[Bridge: XXXTENTACION]
Daisy, those are making Fugazi
Lost, I pick up a case and
Close it, close it, pick up the rabies (ay, ay, ay)
Daisy, those are making Fugazi
Lost, I pick up a case and
Close it, close it, pick up the rabies (ay ay, ay ay)

[Outro: XXXTENTACION & Bones]
Living a farce
Living a farce, living a farce
Living a farce
Living a farce, living a farce
I've held a ghost
And it slipped through my fingertips
