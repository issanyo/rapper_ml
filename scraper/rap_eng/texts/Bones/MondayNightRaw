[Verse 1: Na$ty Matt]
Gold rings like Sonic
240sx thats onyx, creepin' on the Enkei's
The same color as chronic
All black like mabel, chairs, ladders, and tables
Hardcore young corleone, with a bad bitch like sable
Raccoon City, downtown, hipster bitch but her ass round
New Balance draggin' on the ground
Like sargent slaughter I'm camoed down
All my dogs in black civics
Me and my dogs with plastic bitches
Cartier frames clear lenses, that means no limits
Keep my teeth glossy, lace me up with versace
Gold chains from the swap meet
Imma profit like the posse
That ghetto D all about that gettin' green
Baby bottles full of that fuckin' lean
Dreamcast on the fuckin' screen
It's 1999 got the Lexus riding clean
Gold BBS', nasty popped up on the scene
In the back with the machete, in the front with that Glock 19

[Hook: Na$ty Matt]
Gold mouth, pistol player
Dead man, undertaker
Zombie pimp, 3 days later white lexus a gold pager
Night of the living bread, brain tissues fed
Give me head til' I'm left for dead
Gold mouth, pistol player
Dead man, undertaker
Zombie pimp, 3 days later white lexus a gold pager
Night of the living bread, brain tissues fed
Give me head til' I'm left for dead

[Verse 2: Bones]
Masked up like Mysterio, I don't really think that they hear me though
Black and white like the acolytes, I take your girl to the afterlife
Turn buckin, throwin suckers, DX when them guns bustin
Flame throwin', I ain't slowin' down for no one
My lifes a fuckin' power blast and I'm comin down
Hate me then, but you love me now
Goldberg that jackhammer, 100 herse that sledge hammer
Godfather that whole train, they down to fuck with the whole team
If you down to ride just hop aside, we can blow the spot like propane
I'm back, like that, flow goin' like a turbo vette
Sir Mix A Lot, I get a lot of butt
Young Billy Gunn, I get a lot of ass
I'm pullin' up to your damn spot, you tappin' out, I'm shamrock
TitanTron I rip it down, it's a big show that you can't stop
Nasty ridin' in shotgun, nasty loadin' that shotgun
Talkin' down about me or him, nasty bout to go pop guns
Global gang, golden wings, Team Sesh til' the end of days
Crackin' skulls, I'm breakin' bones
I'm doing numbers, you're on yellow page

[Hook: Na$ty Matt]
Gold mouth, pistol player
Dead man, undertaker
Zombie pimp, 3 days later white lexus a gold pager
Night of the living bread, brain tissues fed
Give me head til' I'm left for dead
Gold mouth, pistol player
Dead man, undertaker
Zombie pimp, 3 days later white lexus a gold pager
Night of the living bread, brain tissues fed
Give me head til' I'm left for dead
