[Intro]
"Down in yon forest, there stands a hall:
The bells of Paradise I heard them ring:
It’s covered all over with purple and pall
And I love my Lord Jesus above anything

In that hall there stands a bed:
The bells of Paradise I heard them ring:
It’s covered all over with scarlet so red:
And I love my Lord Jesus above anything"
Frozen

[Verse 1]
Sitting in the motherfucking dirt just hurt
Always bitching about you never get the shit that you deserve
While you rotting on the curb Ima take off with the birds
Waiting for the right time but for me now works
We forever create levels hit the lever kill the power
Every dot a witching hour on the clock upon the mantel
Don't be acting like you mental you don't really wanna feel it
Hearing what ain't really there seeing what you know you isn't
Exhale blow the leaves strip search all the trees
Bones like his forest sharp leave if you don't want to bleed
All they wanna be is me all I wanna do is leave
I contaminate the minds of the viewers of the slang
Fuck
And I thought it would be different
Still the same message don't care if you listening
And you use to be doubtful
You play the game but SESH make the console
How many fucking times do I gotta go and say it
You ain't fucking with us touching anything we fucking made
They watch then repeat through their own shit (own shit)
But they'll never duplicate the flow bitch (flow bitch)
If it ain't SESH then you know I don't know it (know I don't know it)
If it ain't our show there ain't no point in going

[Hook]
Oh
I am what they're not
They land in the rocks
I'm a motherfucking problem, oh
I aim for the brush but I landed on the top
This a good little spot I know
I am what they're not
They land in the rocks
I'm a motherfucking problem, oh
I aim for the brush but I landed on the top
This a good little spot I know, oh
