[Verse 1: Bones]
I found you at a low place
I made it my dream to take you higher
I found you with a new face
I made it my plan to be your newest, so it's
Geronimo at the top of my lungs
Until I sink into your arms and get saved by your love, I'm screamin'
Geronimo
Geronimo look out below
(Geronimo look out below)

[Verse 2: The LockWest Monster]
She look me in my eye
And I still can't explain, just what it did to me, but I most certainly changed, and now it's
Impossible, I surrendered my heart
Self destructing for her love, I should've known from the start, and now it's
Geronimo at the top of the hill
There's no other way to show how just how elated I feel, I'm screamin'
Geronimo
Yeah
Geronimo, look out below
