[Verse]
Still no preservatives, stick to your murder shit
Capsules and milligrams you never heard of it
Stick to the surface shit, sleep through the dirty shit
I'm whipping clips while I'm wrappin' up furnishes
Cherry oak cabinets, this is class with no assets
We come around, you just circle our absence
Decorative accent, elegant lining, curb appeal with minimum signing
Bones got the flow like soap
Tryna grab a hold to clean for you though
Stood the world up and i played my role
Pale skin, bright chains like keys in the snow
You don't wanna know the kind of things
That go on inside of my dome
My body's a home and my skull is my room and I spend my time bored in the dark
Bones

[Hook]
All on borrowed time, to stay within the lines
Hold on, fuck up if you suffer, don’t bitch, complain or whine
Just take what the world has given you
And with you know every day's anew
You can reboot your systems here
Uploading modem’s all you’ll hear
