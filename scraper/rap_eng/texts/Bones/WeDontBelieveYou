[Verse 1: Bones]
Say you runnin' and gunnin' and buckin' and thuggin'
I can't believe that shit (no sir!)
Say you juggin' and movin' that work by the unit
I don't believe that shit (no sir!)
If that bitch do not say that I am the hardest
I don't believe that bitch (no sir!)
If yo girl was mine I would jump in your mind
And I get up and leave that bitch
That money you holdin' I know that it's stolen
I don't believe that shit (no sir!)
That Glock that you flashin' I know that it's plastic
We don't believe that shit (no sir!)
If my blunt is rolled then I'm ready to smoke
I'd never leave that bitch (no sir!)
If money was somehow turned into a woman
You'd never see that bitch (no sir!)

[Verse 2: Xavier Wulf]
All of you niggas is stupid, I sit back and do this
I rather you clueless, I sneak up and change evolution
Solution be kill off the industry
Rather the heathens who plot to attack at me
Who could say why I'm a tragedy?
My plans are magically made with miraculous accuracy (ooh)
I could attack quickly (ooh)
Who are you to a damn masterpiece?
Selena come back just to sing to me
I don't know if I am even controlling me
I kill then I sleep, then smoke and repeat
I see you at dawn with the fleet with me (ooh)
We swing and we cut and repeat til it's dusk
I don't let these hoes come finesse on me (ooh)
Ho clean yourself up, you can look but don't touch

[Verse 3: Chris Travis]
Bitch don't say that I'm not with the shit
I do nothing, but slaughter the bitch
Godfather whip, black charms on the stick
Tie you up from yo arm to your wrist
Give no fucks, bitch, I'm armed to the tech
So show nuff' and you'll be found in a tip
With a S on my chest, you can call me Clark Kent
No vest on your chest, then a tip to your head
Sucka I'm coming, ain't nowhere to hide
Ride with a nigga or die for yo pride
Ride in disguise, with red in my eyes
My phone on my lap with my grip on the side
Nigga try me then he ready to die
Take what you own then make it all mine
Bitch I've been doing this, niggas is new to this
Kill everything and fuck it I'm through with it, bitch
