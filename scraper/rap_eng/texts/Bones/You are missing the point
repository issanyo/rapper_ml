[Verse]
While you worried about the burdens of yesterday
We're just smoking and passing the time until we pass away
I throw it to you you throw it to me I pass it right back x2
I count the cracks in the ceiling
I long to be dreaming away from this feeling
Fuck everybody that's honest
I hold my breathe a little longer
Eyes rollin back in my head now I see how they said
Bones boy you got a problem

[Hook]
It's late in the city the lights how they glow
Blurry the smoke appear more when it's cold
This time last year we were half as known
It's funny when ramen ain't what's on the stove
Hold on wait a minute I don't think these bitches get it
Hold on wait a minute I don't think these bitches get it
Hold on wait a minute I don't think these bitches get it
Hold on wait a minute I don't think these bitches get it
Hold on I don't think these bitches get it
No no
Hold on I don't think these bitches get it
No no
