[Verse 1: Luke Pickett]
Even though I'm striving for the spotlight
Always find me hiding in the night life
Even though it's overdue, it's high time
Keep on going under, need some downtime

[Chorus: Luke Pickett]
Can't take
These lights
Shining on my life
Can't take
These lights
Shining on my life

[Verse 2: Bones]
I don't wanna talk if you can't tell
Nothing I love more than hate mail
Step up to SESH and I bring you to hell
I was raised by JNL
Cutting them off like a hangnail
Razor on my hip
If you ain't one of us, we can tell
You ain't gotta say shit
Two dead bodies one gas tank
Zero regrets for the past
One match strike and a burnt Ford
That's how the legend of Bones was born
