[Hook: Bones]
Don’t know where I’m going
Don’t know where I’m heading
All I know is one thing and that’s I need you
Rolling up dope as I’m pushing up the interstate
Wanna go home but I keep it moving anyway
I just need you to wait for me
I’m pulling up to your house now
Baby I just need your faith in me
I can’t do this all alone
Don’t know where I’m going
Don’t know where I’m heading
All I know is one thing and that’s I need you
Rolling up dope as I’m pushing up the interstate
Wanna go home but I keep it moving anyway
I just need you to wait for me
I’m pulling up to your house now
Baby I just need your faith in me
I can’t do this all alone
Don’t know where I’m going
Don’t know where I’m heading
All I know is one thing and that’s I need you
Rolling up dope as I’m pushing up the interstate
Wanna go home but I keep it moving anyway
I just need you to wait for me
I’m pulling up to your house now
Baby I just need your faith in me
I can’t do this all alone

[Outro]
Everybody wants a reason for everything
It’s so much easier with someone or something to blame
I’ve always struggled at the root of the problem
Has it been absence, or my constant lack of defense
I’ve never spent a lot on finding the remedy
I guess I figured that it hurt for a reason I guess
That’s why I’ve always turned to writing it down
