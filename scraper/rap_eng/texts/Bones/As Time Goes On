[Verse 1: Bones]
Talkin' down, get your dreams knocked off
In my sights, reddish lights with the heat locked on
All you've ever wanted was to be top dog
Now you crawling like a kitten life alert on call
Twenty zones hundred bones sittin' pretty peelin' oranges
Seeds gettin' sprinkled in the lawn while I'm smoking
Eight pill cells, sittin' on the roof
Savin' money, making money while I'm making juice
I'm creepin' for the evening watch you step and make a noose
Double cross me I just make a tune, never make a truce
We looking like the troop and we soundin' like it too
Everybody else lying, they can't speak the way we do

[Hook: Bones]
Sit down, sit down
You don't wanna know a thing, sit down
Sit down, sit down
You don't wanna know a thing, sit down
