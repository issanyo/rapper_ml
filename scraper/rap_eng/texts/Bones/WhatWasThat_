[Verse 1]
Okay, you can get it, not offended, not a problem
Cause every single one that came my way
You know I solved 'em
I keep my phone dead
Still, they hit me, still they calling'
I take just what I need
Dropping and mix it in the cauldron
Drop (Drop)
Let it drop on they ass
Every shadow of the past
Blow away with the ash
Never stop (stop)
You can never get a pass
Step away from the trash
If you come in, you gon' get that ass stomped (Stomped)
I reside under the bridge
Where the dead come to live
Two stroke coated ribs get whomped (whomped)
Dirty rag to the mouth
You ain’t know what we about
Where the tracks and the route get dumped
Remember the Trail behind Jonna’s
We'd gather Corona’s
They empty of course
And we bag ‘em
And go just get us a quarter
Of something that we thought was dope
Fuck it though, fuck it though, roll it
When it get bad, you will know it
Wallow away in the same fucking place
Just a person that hated that town that he came
Fuck it though, fuck it though, roll it
When it get bad, you will know it
We paid a fee all we got was the faux
All we wanted was fire and a blunt just to roll
Am I lurking at your door
You don’t really want to know
Shut your eyes let it go
Put your dreams in a boat
Let it float
You gonna know when I come in through the floor
When the waves crash down and you wake up to a noise
“What was that?” “What was that?” “What was that?”
“What was that?” “What was that?” “What was that?”
What
