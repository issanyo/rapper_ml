[Verse 1]
One and only
Mack like Roni
Mannie fresh jigging into motherfuckin home base
Damier checks that's a motherfuckin cold case
Lookin all around and its nothing like the old place
Whoa
Black rob when I open up my eyes I'm the first one surprised
When I'm looking like whoa
Use to pay in quarters now we pull up the store
Baby run on through the door like go
Team never gave a fuck SESH forever going up
Every second of the day, every breath that's in my lungs
Every time I fumigate
Turn the breeze to a gust
Drop it down where you stay?

[Hook]
We could stop drop and roll forever
Cuz fires happen no matter the weather
You can hope for the best but you know the worst might come
Just leave my body somewhere dark
Put all my things in a box on the porch

[Verse 2]
Yeah, aye, aye
Fade into the scene
Know its bones
No "who's he?"
So they pull they cameras out and zoom like boosie
Fruits of my labor, all my fruits from the neighbors
I don't bend for no favors
Bitch I give em every flavor
Moves every day and that's how I've remained
Ever since Nigo had the ice cream chain
Back when a 100 dollars sounded like a dream
Now it's 100 times that every time I scream
The bandwidth way too ligh for me
I break the server
I fry the machine
See people never really took a liking to me
Up until now they turn from sour to sweet

[Hook]
We could stop drop and roll forever
Cuz fires happen no matter the weather
You can hope for the best but you know the worst might come
Just leave my body somewhere dark
Put all my things in a box on the porch
