[Hook]
I just want to sit in my room and listen
To all the music that we did when we were younger
I know that times have changed
If every second's a wave then every day I'm going under

[Post-Hook]
Shame on me, for never opening up my door
Blame it all on me
"I don't know why you're doing it it's not good and it's not healthy- it's not right."

[Verse]
What difference will it make, baby? Nothing at all so
I will be right here, letting it all go
Wait 'til you see me, you won't recognize me
The life that I'm leading, it helps when you're hiding

[Hook]
I just want to sit in my room and listen
To all the music that we did when we were younger
I know that times have changed
If every second's a wave then every day I'm going under
