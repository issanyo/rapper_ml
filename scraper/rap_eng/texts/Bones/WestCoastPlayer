[Intro]
Just another 24 in that californ-i-a
The blunts gettin' rolled and the pimps gettin' paid
It's all day all night ridin' to the flow, cuz it's just another 24

[Hook]
The kids outside and the sun is shinin, it's just another 24
The pimps still pimpin' and their rings still blindin', it's just another 24
Ridin' up the block to the store for some OE, it's just another 24
When i'm on the block hear my name guess they know me, it's just another 24

[Verse 1]
I slide to the right, i side to the left, i slide in my ride put the tape in the deck
I turn on the alpine let that blast, i got my windows down so they can see me when i pass
I'm coolin', cruisin', ballin' like Ewing, house-shoes on bitch i'm 1992-in
Sun kinda bright so i throw on my shades, cartier frames keep the sun out my face
I know i been sinnin', but know i'm never prayin', angels on my dick like i'm on the cross hangin'
Blunts in the manger, say it's too danger, risk take a risk as i load up my banger
Click-click, boom, don't fear it
Bones on ya block and i know these suckers hear it
But i don't ever hear them, that's with the 24
It's just another day it's just another 24

[Hook]
The kids outside and the sun is shinin, it's just another 24
The pimps still pimpin' and their rings still blindin', it's just another 24
Ridin' up the block to the store for some OE, it's just another 24
When i'm on the block hear my name guess they know me, it's just another 24
