[BONES]
Ancient silk, gold buttons
Hear the bass, know BONES coming
Young Pharaoh, I'm a young prince
They bow to me and keep drugs coming
Rolling up on my throne
Crown flooded in stones
Sapphires, got emeralds
I got diamonds next to my pearls
Young majesty, they asking me
What I want to eat
Say "Fashion me"
Bowl of fruit, big glass of life
One satin rag to shine up my knife
All my life, every night
Eyes out the glass, case the reaper tries
Guns blaring, future died
Is it life or death, quick you decide
In the casket deep, young tragedy

[Hook (x3)]
Dapper punk
Flow masterpiece
Whole village
They bow to me
Turn water to lean
Turn grass to weed
