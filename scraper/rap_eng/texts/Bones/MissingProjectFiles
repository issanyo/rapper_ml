[Verse]
Ride dirty, motocross (vroom, vroom)
Used to crawl like a frog (what, what)
Now I fly like Macross (phew, phew)
Across the land and through the fog
Chris Jericho, I break it down (break it down)
Y2J countdown (countdown)
Hands wrapped like Crash (like Crash)
Five packs in the bag (in the bag)
If you ever had my back (had my back)
Know I got you like tag (like tag)
I will get there in a flash (in a flash)
A lot of ram, no lag
Wait

[Hook]
Life don't stop (stop)
Everybody rot (rot)
Might as well be the only skeleton on the top (top)
Sit, just watch (watch)
This is why I'm hot (ah)
Prepping like specs but I'm looking like Nacht
Okay, you pulling up in the drop (in the drop, in the drop)
Me, I just walk up in the spot (in the spot, in the spot)
Jotting notes like Bach (like Bach, like Bach)
Let me hear what you got (what you got, what you got, bitch)
