[Verse 1]
Waking up real early
Plants in the vase make the place look perty
Looks so ugly and sounds so dirty
I know they coming out just to say that they heard me
Surely, burning, cracked blunt surgeon
Cashed wood general reporting for service
Everyday learning
Still never perfect
Razor on me, no weapons on my person
Paid me for a verse, now they think they got a purpose
Couldn't get it free please dont call it working
Speaking on me, think its funny keep talking
I do this for me you just do it for some star shit
Reaching for reasons to keep with your breathing
Couple comments and some views now you cheesing
Hope you go far with this shit, please believe me
Then you'll realize that the goals, they'll deceive you
Think that you know but you gonna be receiving
Redeeming to take you to the life how you dreamed it
Sitting just me, no ID, no money, no hope, not a wish inside of me

[Bridge]
And its gone far down to earth
You know, you know
You know, you know

[Verse 2]
I submerge in the shadow and I never show up
I don’t live, I don’t die, I don’t ever grow up
I just hang like the willow
I stand hundred some years later in abandoned wet lands
Came across a bean nighe, asked for a chance
Show me how it is for the one who I am
Every second lived in a three second span
Then disappear, now alone I stand

[Outro]
Oh, I can think you're lonely
