[Verse 1]

White skin gold chain
It's only when it rains
Flashbacks runnin' through my mind like drugs in my veins
Everyday the same, tryna maintain this being I became
Blunts to the face
Everything cool, everything fine, everything grand
Money in my hand I got money in my hand
I could never leave rap you could never understand
Put your heart into a flow and you'll see what I'm sayin'
Never by the gram, always by the ounce
Got a place around the corner for a hundred for a pound
I'll show you what I'm bout, double Y when I like
Cup full of the [?] mix sunny to light
Bitch I'm high as a kite, I'm deceased as a corpse
Too cashed lookin' like a zombie when I walk (when I walk)
SESH

[Outro]

This is the time when you roll up all your drugs and get yourself together, ya know
