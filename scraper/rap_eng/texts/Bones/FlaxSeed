[Intro: Robin Williams]
"What do you want to do?
You and your bullshit. You've got a bullshit answer for everybody
But I ask you a very simple question and you can't give me a straight answer
Because you don't know"

[Verse]
Blowin' zones in the air
O's by the pair, we ain't never gotta share
His and hers blunt's while the whole world stares
Pullin' and pinnin' back my hair
Grab another leaf and fucking tear
In the lair of the rare
Feel the glare when you approach
You don't see me, you don't hear me, you just feel me like a ghost that I am
Bring a scam, I'm a bring the whole team
All I ever am is me, all I wanna do is break your dreams

[Outro]
Look who done came up (what), raspberry blunts with the granny smith cups
Look who done came up (what), almond milk with the Flaxseed on top
