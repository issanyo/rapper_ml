See us and do it
Fuck is your movement
I, don't, know

No I don't see you
We see right through you
Where, you, go

Copy and paste it
Wash it and take it
There, you, go

Wouldn't expect it
Nothing or less
From, you, no

Working on a sound byte
Tryna' make it sound right
That's, ok

See us man they walk like
Curtis know they talk like
That's, ok

Why do they do it?
I don't know
