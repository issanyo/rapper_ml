[Verse]
Turn the page like Segar
Wrapping up my cigar
Reporting live from the ER
I'm going under like "see ya"
You smiling like Moesha
Light the pilot light, then go heat 'em
No heater on me, no Nina
I don't click-clack, let alone even see ya
Tell 'em go home like Roger
Forty-four blunts and now I'm off it
Pour that four up and get nauseous
Follow the leader like you gonna prosper
Fuck your pockets, got no logic
To your project of nonsense
I hate that hate will grow inside me
Till I'm rendered unconscious

[Hook]
Okay, do not look to me for a lifeline
I only know of one and it's all mine
Okay, do not look to me for a lifeline
I only know of one and it's all mine
