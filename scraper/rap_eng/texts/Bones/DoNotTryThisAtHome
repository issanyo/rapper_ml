[Intro]
Pull the trigger Budd Dwyer

[Verse]
To the kids at home, watch it, no, don't try it (don't try-try it)
Try to stop me, you get dropped just like my eyelids (uh-uh)
Where you at, where you at, wait I found ya (yikes!)
No point in runnin' for cover, no way around it (what)
Wait a second, let me smoke, go ahead count it (count it all)
Hundred minutes, hundred blunts you know my body (know my body)
Want you bad almost got me writing bounties (writing bounties)
There ain't nobody but Bones, baby I got you (what)
Every blaze hurt my back and fuck my posture (fuck it)
Flood your bezzle, reflect everything like water (water)
Step on the SESH lands you bound to get slaughtered (phew-phew)
Go ahead and knock them back and do just what I taught ya
Ya girl she lied to you when she say that she wants ya
I know you hurting bending pockets just like corners
What
