[Verse]
Feeling like Avril Lavigne the way this shit so complicated
Smothered by my own anger, really got to switch up my cadence
I'm always in need of balance I'll never say that I have it
Anytime you see my eyes be aware of what's inside them
It's a wrap if you act, react on attack
Corpse hands on your neck, chills dash up your back
Fears overflow your vision, stripped of all your intuition
Shut your eyes, click your heels, but I'm not here to grant no wishes

[Hook]
I'm the change in the weather
Whether that's worse or better
I'm the change in the weather
I think today you'll need a sweater
What?
