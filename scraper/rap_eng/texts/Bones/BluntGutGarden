[Intro: Robert F. Kennedy sample]
For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with, to be filled with, hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man

[Verse: Bones]
I'm in the garden with the roses
Cup full of oceans, Backwoods smoking
Rare rocks on my fingers
Feeling like a young prince back in 1346
Moats full of acid, ash on my mattress
Drawbridge up, "Thou shall not pass"
Fine art on all the walls, bitch I make and break the laws
Horse and buggy, no cars
Whole village bow down
Step up to my balcony and wave at the crowd
Cane made of emeralds, coins made of gold
Spider silk robes, let them drag on the floor
I never knew I'd be the one
Looking in the mirror at the legend I've become
I never knew I'd be the one
Looking in the mirror at the legend I've become
What?
Bones

[Outro: Robert F. Kennedy sample]
What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another
