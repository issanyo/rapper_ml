[Intro]
Tell me where the drugs at tell me where it be
Let me know where them drugs at let me know the fee
Tell me where the drugs at tell me where it be
Let me know where them drugs at let me know the fee

[Verse 1]
Tape in the deck and bitch stay blastin
While the rest leach like plastic
4 or 5 bags in the center console resting
Never run low I know my investments
Fuck your intentions call on your hench man
Never alone cuz you know you fear being stranded
You don't understand you could travel the land
Find an island to hide in and i will turn to sand
My chemical makeup it was a miscalculation
Our constellation and my making has proven no correlation
I gotta face it

[Bridge]
This is the part where you feel like nothing
Everything is shit coming down from above you
This is the part where you feel like nothing
Everything is shit coming down from above you
I don't got no time so you cannot have mine
I don't got no time so you cannot have mine
I don't got no time so you cannot have mine
I don't got no time so you cannot have mine
I don't got no time so you cannot have mine
I don't got no time so you cannot have mine

[Verse 2]
Smoking packs designing boots
Nowadays I like the truth
I remember a time I found it hard to find
Any grain of truth that I wasn't doomed
Rode the loop for like a second or two
Hopped off the track fell down and found a new
Look out below geronimo I came out of nowhere they don't know what for
They approaching like a crash site smoking from the impact
I emerge blown out light behind me cast a silhouette
They don't know what to expect assumptions get confirmed
I'm a mess sunny days turn to dark when I flip this hour glass
