[Verse 1]

Gold chain renegade
Kill the blunt then kill the stage
King of the underground, slangin' all these mixtapes
Your whole sound bitch made, my shit rules
I'm addicted to flowin' I wake up and I act a fool
Young two thousand and four, in my white T yuh
Pants saggin' out my ass goin' high fee, yuh
Askin' me if i'm high, well bitch i might be yuh
In my no brand shoes settin' fire to some nikes
Rock like diamonds, bars like verizon
Rappin' to prove all of you how not to be like em
Fuck every rapper in existence i don't like em
And if you don't like me, fuck ya i don't like ya
I could be your best friend or i could be the bully, the reason why your ass ain't showin' up to school
The night rap posse, backpack full of tools, duck tape grip hammer if your home need improvin'
Got every sewer groovin' from LA way down to Yuma
Kickin' raps and makin' moves gotta get me paid and get shit movin'
Shower to a jacuzzi
Turn my TV to the movies
Turn my lent into some cash and get all of these cameras shooting
Pow, pow all these cameras shooting
Duck D-duck down, and just watch how they shoot me
Pow, pow all these cameras shooting
Now we bout to make a movie
