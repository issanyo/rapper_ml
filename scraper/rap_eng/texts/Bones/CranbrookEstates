[Verse]
Used to bump project bitch
In the curves and the cul de sac, rolling up sticks, bitch
Bag full of cans, last change in my hands
Coat smelling like mold, got snow on my vans, yeah
No bling, no peace, no rings
No mink on my shoulder, no brands on my feet
Now my phone won't stay quiet
Trying to sell me all my dreams, but I still won't buy it
I wish I was like you, fuck
But I can't 'cause I think too, much

[Outro]
Used to bump project bitch
In the curves and the cul de sac, rolling up sticks
