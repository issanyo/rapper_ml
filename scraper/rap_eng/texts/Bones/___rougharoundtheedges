[Verse]
I look down deep inside
No, I don't like my mind
No, I don't need to cry
When I can see your eyes
Any time I go
I end up crawling back
Every time you show
Me love, I feel intact

[Hook]
There's nothing you could ever do to change how I see you
There's nothing I have left to prove, I've blown it time and time again
There's nothing I could ever do to change the fact I need you
There's something I have yet to do, something I'll never need to

[Bridge]
All I want, all I want
All I want is you
All I want, all I want
All I want is you

[Hook]
There's nothing you could ever do to change how I see you
There's nothing I have left to prove, I've blown it time and time again
There's nothing I could ever do to change the fact I need you
There's something I have yet to do, something I'll never need to

[Outro]
All I want
All I want
All I want is you
All I want
All I want
All I want is you
