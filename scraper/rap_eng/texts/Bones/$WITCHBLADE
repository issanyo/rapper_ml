[Hook]

Switchblade on my waist don't press me
Switchblade on my waist don't press me

[Verse 1]

Switchblade kids play, digital dash display
Grippin' on that woodgrain, cubes in my kool aid
Chains on my neck, hangin' like Jesus Christ two fools gold hair and bone pieces
Jeans with the crease spark a blunt full of demons
Candy paint drippin' leavin' trails in the streets

[Hook]
Switchblade on my waist don't press me
Switchblade on my waist don't press me
Switchblade on my waist don't press me
Switchblade on my waist don't press me
Switchblade on my waist don't press me
