[Verse 1]
Aimless conversation going nowhere
Hopeless expectations never come to fruition
When you're counting on change to come
It covered the room like a blanket of snow
That's not the way it happens now
It changes constant ever so softly, winding its way through time
If I had the words to speak I'd tell you myself
I'm at loss for language when you look at me
I'm looking on, just waiting out this joke
I'm holding on but now I want to let go

[Hook]
I've got to know the truth
I've got to know the truth

[Verse 2]
It's like there's no smiles when I'm coming around
Frowns stamped on their faces and I can't face it
I wish I could really be just like you
I can't take it I've been regretting me the whole day through

[Refrain]
If I had the words to speak I'd tell you myself
I'm at a loss for language when you look at me
