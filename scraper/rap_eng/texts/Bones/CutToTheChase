Motherfuck talking bitch
What the fuck you want from me?
Motherfuck talking bitch
What the fuck you want from me?
Motherfuck talking bitch
What the fuck you want from me?
Motherfuck talking bitch
What the fuck you want from me?

[Verse]
Hair in my face (face)
Can't see a thing (thing)
Fuck where you at, bitch
Fuck where you came
Young Bones still the same (same)
Blade on my waist (waist)
The day I go and change is when they slide me on the tray
And they slowly push me into flames
Now freeze the frame
Skin melting off my face
Charbroil on my teeth (teeth)
We all get fucked in the end, that's real (real)
We all get burnt by the fire of the kiln (what)
It's popular to talk about popping without a deal
I am guilty but I also speak the truth when I whale
Never distribute music but I'm still paid like I sold
1 mil first week, what is life at this point?
Ready to go and you know this
I don't need no piece with no holster
I don't need to "bang" when I pull it
All I need is words and your focus
But if I can't get that
I will turn right back
To the graveyard god
And take you to just where I be at

Motherfuck talking bitch
What the fuck you want from me?
Motherfuck talking bitch

Motherfuck talking bitch
What the fuck you want from me?
Motherfuck talking bitch
What the fuck you want from me?

[Outro]
Okay, I am nothing valuable and neither are you
The place we live would probably be better if we died by noon
If we died by noon
Okay I am nothing valuable and neither are you
The place we live would probably be better if we died by noon
If we died by noon
Died by noon
Died by noon
