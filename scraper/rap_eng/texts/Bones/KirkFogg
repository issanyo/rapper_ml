[Verse]
I was in the tomb, until I moved where it's sunny
Now If you listen closely, you can hear my diamonds hummin'
I'm used to pocket change, so its funny gettin' money
Either I'm filling up my lungs, or I'm filling up my tummy
The Legends of the Hidden Temple, 24 carrot emblems
Chain look like Olmec, rings lookin' like the Incas
Mayans on my diamonds, they admire when we arriving
Whole team fucking cashed, see the sesh up on my eyelids
Gemstones float, while the ash flow down
Know we make our own juice, like we make our own sounds
No free verse, cause I don't do charity
Pistol in my face, crack a smile, there ain't no scaring me
Everybody wanna sound so damn unique
But if I heard your song, I ain't thinkin' bout' the who's he
Bitch I'm thinking turn it down, know you thinking fuck this boy
Go ahead and speak a word, I promise I will love you boy
Bitch I'm thinking turn it down, know you thinking fuck this boy
Go ahead and speak a word, I promise I will love you boy
