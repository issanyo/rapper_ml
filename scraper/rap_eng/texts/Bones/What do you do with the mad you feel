[Verse]
Young scumbag bitch i could never ever switch
Showed the planet who i am it ain't been the same since
So sick of lame shit
I dont wanna name shit
Straight 99%
With the fucking gang bitch
All they do is lane switch
Complain and they bitch
Shit you don’t get it thats a world you ain't in
Mad that I’m not starving at night
Bulb burnt out in every motherfucking light
Finally taking care of our motherfucking life
Instead of just taking i give em what they like
Mr no pulse but i live through the knife
Bless them with a site let them see in the night
Talking all that shit and I’m gonna see ya tonight
Dry skin crack when i crack on site
I'm gonna take you straight into the opposite of light
Make your assumptions and make sure they’re right
Cause when its time to meet I’m gonna show you what its like
To have your veins burn from the gift that is life
Blood start stinging got rust in my pipes
Skin falling off like a plumb when its ripe
White on white that's me when its bright
Blind all eyes shrivel up when i arrive
Hold on wait hold a second i just got a message
The earth just hit me back and said bones please come help us
I’m on my way
I’m on my way
No need to fret no need to stress
Just shine a light in the sky that say sesh and ill be there
