[Intro]
"I'm very well, indeed."
"I think this could be a real masterpiece. This whole record"
"This really, it could be a masterpiece."
"I know it's great, wouldn't it... wouldn't it be great if it hooked in?"
"Easier to rate means that you have a tape now?"
"Yeah they, they, they, they know... there's no playin' around now, okay? No naps, you understand, right? It costs to be in... ground... ground."
"That was great."
"So they won't believe your own death you'll be immortal... (mhmm) go on forever."
"That'd be great." (mhmm)

[Verse]
What?
Sharpen the number 2, rip out some college rule paper
And take down these lessons (lessons)
Eyes on the board if you feel that you're bored and you
Ask me to leave, no I won't let you
I let you in on my mental and I let you
Witness me conduct the lecture (lecture)
You know too much but you truly know little
About this big planet where you have been living
Ash in your brain, must've huffed them away
I knew too many people like you in the day
Day meaning past, and night meaning future
Darkness fall quick but I will never lose you
Up on the hill where I watch
Look down on the place that you call your spot
Up on the hill where I watch
Look down on the place that you call your spot
