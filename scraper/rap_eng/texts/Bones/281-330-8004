[Verse]
Screen up in the dash like I'm fucking Mike Jones
281-330-8004
All my friends are black, now I feel like Paul Wall
Looking like a school shooter when I’m walking through the halls
I got friends that don’t call, I got friends that don’t talk
You don’t want it bitch I promise, leave your body to the wolves
I’m creeping cause I’m cool, smoking like it's all I do
Booming like Macaulay Culkin back in 1992

[Outro: Jane Barbe]
