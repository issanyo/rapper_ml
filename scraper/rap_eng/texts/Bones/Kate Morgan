[Hook: Max P]
I'm skinny but my pockets be bigger
Bitch, I got that blue cheese like Jigga
Like the puffy, we get ghost tonight
Sipping on purple, I feel like Pimp C tonight
I'm skinny but my pockets be bigger
Bitch, I got that blue cheese like Jigga
Like the puffy, we get ghost tonight
Sipping on purple, I feel like Pimp C tonight

[Verse 1: Max P]
Bitch I ain't skinny, I be slim as a motherfucker
My white boy got the knife, and I'm toting the pipes
If a nigga run up then he is a dumb sucka
You better have like 10 niggas with you, and they better have big pumpers
Niggas out here really just be running they mouth, they just be stunting
Niggas need to wash they jaw, they need to catch up, they mouth running
Cooling with my white boy Bones and he got the demons coming
Cooling with my CC's on the block, got the grapes coming
Balling, Dave & Buster's, lil nigga
Got my big gun, you shaking lil nigga
Bones, he got the sword lil nigga
You don't want no fucking war lil nigga

[Hook: Max P]
I'm skinny but my pockets be bigger
Bitch, I got that blue cheese like Jigga
Like the puffy, we get ghost tonight
Sipping on purple, I feel like Pimp C tonight

[Verse 2: Bones]
Bones don't owe you a motherfucking thang
It's that Team SESH vet at yo neck with the blade
Like walk the plank, bitch walk the plank
I get up, hit the blunt, then I'm off for the day
People like to talk about it but don't ever mean it
One click, I go boom and it's you I'm taking with me
To the graveyard, got yo name already on the headstone
Let's just mention me, I do not breathe, I am the dead one

[Hook: Max P]
I'm skinny but my pockets be bigger
Bitch, I got that blue cheese like Jigga
Like the puffy, we get ghost tonight
Sipping on purple, I feel like Pimp C tonight
I'm skinny but my pockets be bigger
Bitch, I got that blue cheese like Jigga
Like the puffy, we get ghost tonight
Sipping on purple, I feel like Pimp C tonight
