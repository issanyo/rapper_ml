[Bones]
You are all I know, You are all I know
I will hold you close
Never let you go
It don't matter when
It don't matter why
If you meet me there I'll be there tonight
As the time goes by, my love never die
It just multiplies, you are my divine
I will spend my life, I will waste my time
I will hang my head but I will not cry
Am I coming through loud and clear?
If you need me I'll get you there
Ahh Ahh Ahhh
Ahh Ahh Ahhh
Ahh Ahh Ahhh

[Dylan Ross]
I'm not thinking 'bout heaven
And I'm not worried 'bout hell
I'm still dripping like a faucet at an artesian well
On new horizons, vaporizing, bitch, breathe in the smell
Young mid-western player spin real ass game
Top notch and top shelf
Feeling just like '96 or '97 I'm steaming trick
Feeling just like Mr. Shivers
Or a time lapse to the 7th guess
I'm 'bout it bitch
Bitty 'bout it bitch since '91 til I'm out this bitch
Never never will I ever be anything other than The Killer With A Crooked Jaw
Comin' out the Midwest

[Hook]
As I raise out of a misty haze
Wondering aimlessly for days in the perils of my Hedge Maze
Ivy and vines all around me encase my head space
Until my destination is only the next place
