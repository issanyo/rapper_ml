[Verse 1]
Young girl and she bad
Tongue full of them tats
More drugs on her back
Now she trippin' off of that acid
Pills on the counter tell me they were aspirin
I ain't askin' that you can have it
She too high, she tell me bring it down
I grab her by the hand and put a blunt up in mouth
Slightly down south
Swangin' on them curbs
It's like we downtown when i'm bangin' in the curse

[Outro]
Trippin'
She want it bad she gon' have to wait cus i'm sippin'
But it's gettin' late there's no time to waste let's get naked
All by ourselves and we really high so tell me why the fuck are we waitin'
