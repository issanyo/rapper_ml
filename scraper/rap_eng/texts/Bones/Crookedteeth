(Verse 1)
Crooked teeth, wrinkled clothes
Why you worry bout some hoes
I'm just drowning in the smoke
I'm just trying not to float
Two braids when I flow, no chain but I glow
Like myself after some beauty sleep
Creeping out the smoke
Bitch I'm peeping out my home
Cause I know I'm not alone
Feel my essence through the presence
Of my waves when I flow
Know I came just to go
It's the teenage ghost
When Im speaking you don't hear it
You just feel it in your bones
I'm looking like the man right now
The white dead punk with the plan right now
I'm feeling like the man right now
Saw your show and I hope you don't think
That shits a crowd

(Outro)
I'm gripping up on that razor, my hood up and I'm bumping, I'm gripping up on that razor, when I'm on the block you running
