[Verse]
Everyone know my name
Everyone know my face
Everyone know my chain
Everyone know my ring
Everyone know I go
Everyone know I flow
Everyone know I'm crack
Everyone know I'm dope
Everyone know I'm Bones
So these women they calling my phone
These females they trying to blow
Cause my skin the same color as coke
Going ghost, going gone
Riding with that firearm
Fire alarms going off
The final warning, final call see
I know that you hate me
I know you can't take it
The second you saw that I'm starting to make it
You starting to hate it, I'm starting to love it
Spit it so lovely, nobody could touch it
Then again who wanna?
In the backseat of that hummer
Rolling cigars full of drugs
Bumping that number one stunner
Let me ride it out
187s and I'm hiding out
Young white punk with a blunt in his mouth
Switchblade in his sock
Don't make him pull it out

[Hook]
I'm gone, I'm zoning
I, I, I'm zoning
I flow like water when I'm alone and I'm fucking zoning
Bitch I'm, I'm zoning
I, I, I'm zoning
I flow like water when I'm alone and I'm fucking zoning
Bitch I'm...
