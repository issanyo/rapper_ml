[Hook]
Step in the room they like oh no
We gotta go go we gotta ride look at the time oh
Now what do you know know
What are you waiting for, I know you see the door
I presume that you'll find your way out

[Verse 1 ]
I'm underneath the soil for you down, down, down
Even when the world is over I will be around
Too far ahead they say wait, wait, wait
Please let us play, play, play
I say no way, I say no way, I say no way

[Hook]
Step in the room they like oh no
We gotta go go we gotta ride look at the time oh
Now what do you know know
What are you waiting for, I know you see the door
I presume that you'll find your way out
