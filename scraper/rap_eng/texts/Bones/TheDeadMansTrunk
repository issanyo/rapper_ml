[Verse 1]
I could breathe wrong and trigger them all
You don't gotta say shit when you on
Walking proof that a human can do wrong
Make you an example, send you home, like tell them all
Thought that you could play me for a bitch I make a call
No, it's not for backup, it's for you to break it down
Give me what you got cause I bet I ain't have that
Ducking me like AFLAC, I'll drop you like the NASDAQ
Digital dash pad flash when we pass that
House where you at location we done cached that
All I've ever wanted was some face to face contact
Hold up, what you say, bitch, Bones didn't catch that
Straight facts, quickly react bitch, I push your brain back
Hate that we came up ourselves no one can say that
Straight facts, quickly react bitch, I push your brain back
Hate that we came up ourselves no one can say that
I am the reason you buzzing I think that you that puzzled, my boy, you have got me confused
Thinking I'll pull out this hate for no reason to aim it at random and let off a few
I got a trunk with a lock and key that I stash in the woods for one day to be used
I truly hope that somebody will stray far enough from path and be ready to view

[Hook]
Secrets unleashed with one twist of the key
Studied to the n-th degree, die and report back to me
Secrets unleashed with one twist of the key
Studied to the n-th degree, die and report back to me
