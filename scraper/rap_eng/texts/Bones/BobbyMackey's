[Verse 1: Bones]
Young living legend
I don't need no Mac-11
Feed her pills to she kill
Then I smoke and resurrect em'
Bitch I'm creeping in the kut
Spider webs up on my blunt
Blood dripping from my wrists
Got veins full of drugs
Locked away in the cellar
Got a girl like Sarah Gellar
Only smoking If I let her
I'll be killing If I tell her
Young Freddie Prinze Jr
I don't need a fucking Ruger
Bitch I sound like bodies dropping
And I look like school shooters

[Bridge: Bones]
Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang, let it bang
1,2,3 Young Bones on the creep
Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang, let it bang
It's the skinny white pimp gripping on the switchblade

[Verse 2: Na$ty Matt]
Nasty, Nasty
Might catch your body, like a trust fall
Hell in a cell vs. Chris Benoit
My click in the presence
Feel how cold the air gets
Bones up on the VHS
Looking for the blair witch
[?] Visuals satanic rituals
Brainwash a nice girl to pop that thing to mystical
Can't believe your eyes but you know I'm too real
Got that fucking thing tucked, like Buffalo Bill
Resident Evil: Raccoon City
Drugged out zombie bitch snorting blow off of Jill's titties
But this ain't a game on the PlayStation
I don't exist I'm a fucking myth
Figment of your imagination
