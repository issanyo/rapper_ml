[Verse]
R kelly braids smoking blunts with my robe on
TeamSESH up only bumping my own songs
Pinky ring shiny got a glow on
Flow give em stage fright show must go on
I get my roll on, nothing to roll on, but I don't need one fuck it roll a new bone
Grey poupon back of the limo, heading to the bath house feel like jahiro
I dont wanna dance with you girl but I watch though
Let my seat back sign a lease for the condo
One up in the midwest one up on an island one in california the sounds of the sirens
Some are playing violins but my brain frys and chocolate milkshake dollar signs on my eyelids
Big blunts on the tray with my chains, jewels layed out like its mtv-
Cribs , cris in the fridge, ice in my glass ice cold when i sip
Strawberry dipped in chocolate alpine blast through my trunk be knockin, lowkey lookin for the profit, thats nothing
