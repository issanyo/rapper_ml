Hundred spoke rims
Hundred proof gin
Doing 150 in my hundred dollar timbs
Tangueray clouds
Alize drops
Cognac dreams of the motherfucking top
Diamond on the wheel Ruby on the dash
Sapphire blunts flicking emerald ash
24 karats 24 hours
Got a penthouse look like the Eiffel tower
Mary Antoinette
Jewels on my chest
Village bow to me when I'm hopping off the jet
Shag rug carpet all gold vossen the day that I go need me a gold coffin
Blunts I'm sparking pitbulls barking never catch me without some frames like Arthur
Young King Bones, heir to the throne hoes feed me grapes and hear the ring from my phone
Get the dial tonin', call and collect
Star 67 you don't get no respect
I been out there slamming doors
I been out there slamming doors knocking pictures off the wall I'm a motherfucking pimp and I'm riding in the whip
What you know about this, bitch it's 1996 I'm a motherfucking pimp
Motherfucking pimp, riding in the whip like it's '96 I'm a motherfucking pimp, riding in the whip like it's '96 what
