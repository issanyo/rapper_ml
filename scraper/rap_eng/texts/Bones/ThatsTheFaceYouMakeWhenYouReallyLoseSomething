[Bones]
Am I coming through clearly now
I remember when I couldn't make a sound
Am I coming through clearly now
Wake and I think
Why was I put here
I don't give a fuck enough
I don't give a fuck enough
Wake and I think
Why was I put here
I don't give a fuck enough
I don't give a fuck enough
What is the difference
Between a bad and a good day
Nothing at all

[Dylan Ross]
Everything is out of place now
So I stay in my room til' it spins
I can feel a surge of sharpness
Like a fresh wound in the wind
Were about to start a new chapter
Serendipitous in nature with this spin
I will be here for you until the year after
And even after we both give into death
How do I know what it means to be saved
How do I dance with two feet in the grave
How do I justify a reason to stay
I wrap my troubles up and dream them away
I wrap my troubles up and dream them away
I wrap my troubles up and dream them away
I wrap my troubles up and dream them away
