[Verse]
Arm out the windows
Swerve to the tempo
Rims go round
Like cigars full of indo
Ride with yo kinfolk
Some beat down
Windows up and the bass up loud
See the apline blastin'
Petal I'm mashing
They tell me I'm the best and I know they ain't gassin'
Looking like Christ
Sippin alizee passion
I ain't even smoke
Still the tray full of ashes
Everytime I pass
Yeah i'm laughing
You're sitting at your mama's crib actin' like you rappin'
Say you gettin' famous
I say you're still nameless
You say you been trainin'
I say you been wastin'
Time of your life
You gonna die one day
And regret trynna copy every word that I say
Bitch, it's in me
Never been trendin'
Hand me down clothes
While you stuck rockin' fendi
No brand names on my tags
I'm sportin' hand me down rags
No Glock in my wood grain dash
I kill em off like the way that I rap
Switchblade still stuffed in my pants
Let me know if you want to meet death
Ice cold flow
See the frost on the glass
Let me know if you trynna be next
Try too hard but bitch I do this
Ice cold flow
One hand
I'm cruisin'
Never pop girls
Never playin' no shoot
And vanilla paint job on my ice cream buick
Chocolate, my seats
And my trunk go bananas
Shake, earthquake
Know it's young Bones jammin'
Girls ain't dancin'
Eyes ain't gluin'
I ain't even looking but I found that chooga
