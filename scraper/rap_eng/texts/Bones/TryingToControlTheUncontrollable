[Verse]
I just want you to be okay
But I know that I am not magic
Emotions do what they have to
Sometimes, I wish that wasn't real
I hope I learn to feel, one day some way, one day some way
I don't mean to be that way with you
You're my only exclusion
Sorry for the confusion
I know I'm not easy to love
Not easy to love
So sorry for what I've done
Every night that you sleep, I hope that I'm in your dreams
Every morning I wake, you are the first one that I see

[Outro]
I wanna feel it forever
I wanna feel it forever
I wanna feel it forever
I wanna feel it forever
