[Hook: Bones]
I got a fuckin' gold rope hanging round my neck
Gold Cadillac just to match the Rolex
Two or three rings every time I do my thing
The kid from '94 but the flow from '93

[Verse 1: Bones]
I had to take it back, back to the days
New white shirt, you could still see the crease
Pager on my hip, drugs by the key
Ghost-white limo, cocaine limousine
Different color syrups, different color weed
Your girlfriend love me cause I make her feel free
Whatever that mean, bitch, it's okay
We could ride around all night, all day
Rollin' up these blunts and blowin' 'em to the breeze
See, I ain't tryin' to fuck, I'm tryin' to smoke, now roll up three
Now she say she high, say I'm about to leave
Kiss up on the cheek, I grab the keys and hits the streets
Leather bucket seats, candy painted Chevy
Inside peanut butter, outside jelly

[Hook: Bones]
I got a fuckin' gold rope hanging round my neck
Gold Cadillac just to match the Rolex
Two or three rings every time I do my thing
The kid from '94 but the flow from '93
I got a fuckin' gold rope hanging round my neck
Gold Cadillac just to match the Rolex
Two or three rings every time I do my thing
The kid from '94 but the flow from '93
