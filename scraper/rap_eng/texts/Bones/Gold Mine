[Verse 1: J.K. The Rapper]
Everybody want that fire bitch I got that cold
You gon boil in that shit keep talking bout that gold
End up the river without a paddle fucking with them hoes
Wonder why we laughing at yo ass? cause you a fucking joke
Tom Clancy flow, better duck when you under the scope
Ain't no hope, in FANG we trust, the look up to us like I'm the pope
Fucking right, fucking dope
Fool talk shit but where he go?
I know he irrelevant but my S's got love for hoes steppin' in
Take her back to the pink room, then bring her back to hell again
7 deadly sins rolling with 7 deadly men
Oh know here we go again, see right through yo window tint
Oh, now niggas wanna get tense? better tighten up with yo ho loose
This life ill & that's so true, but at least you ain't met death yet
Have you face time with Satan if you keep fucking round with them death threats
Yeah, I'm Erick Draven raising out that black haven
Bring any rapper to this graveyard & watch me fucking slay em nigga

[Hook]
If everything gold watch em boil in the gold mine
Say they want my soul? Can't do it, I ain't got one
If everything gold watch em boil in the gold mine
Say they want my soul? Can't do it, I ain't got one
This reaper music, reaper music, reaper music ho
The devil's keepers music, you gotta listen to it
This reaper music, reaper music, reaper music ho
The devil's keepers music, you gotta listen to it

[Verse 2: J.K. The Rapper]
I'm tired of sober bitches talking bout taking molly
Let me see you try to turn up in yo muthafuckin' casket
I'm tired of broke niggas talking bout illuminati
Get a life & get off fucking media take out you faggots
I've had it, fuck it & I can't take it no more
& I ain't fucking no whore unless her pussy looks like heavens doors
& I won't hesitate to smack a bitch with my dick
Bitch it's 1996, get with it or turn the channel quick muthafucka

[Hook]
If everything gold watch em boil in the gold mine
Say they want my soul? can't do it, I ain't got one
If everything gold watch em boil in the gold mine
Say they want my soul? can't do it, I ain't got one
This reaper music, reaper music, reaper music ho
The devil's keepers music, you gotta listen to it
This reaper music, reaper music, reaper music ho
The devil's keepers music, you gotta listen to it

[Verse 3: Speakz]
Came up out the tomb, my resurrection was perfection
While them pussy bubblegummers saw all red like they were benson
Cool with me, my eulogy was written with eternity
Calvin Klein cologne baller, that was just the jew in me
Ha, lodi dodi still dreaming of the Audi
European auto body smashing like Amare Staude'
Heard you go the thirst, well I went & got a hearse
Big enough to body earth, I make a wave & watch em surf
Now everybody shallow so I drown em in my current
But never that for me, ???? is too perfect
Black magic women got me stiffer than a corpse
She dropped dead gorgeous I might fuck her in my morgue
The gold mine

[Verse 4: Bones]
Bones
SESH
FANG, Life

Graveyard God
Switch blade in my jaw
Steadily creepin' through the night
Steadily reaching out the door
Find me leaping out the car
Flicking my blade, not giving a fuck
Come as you are or don't come in at all
Reaper, the beamer, I'm cutting em off
From my flow
I'mma go
I'mma take em back to the 1-9-9-4
Young pimp named Bones
Skin white like ghost
Flow crack like socks in the hood on the block

[Hook]
If everything gold watch em boil in the gold mine
Say they want my soul? can't do it, I ain't got one
If everything gold watch em boil in the gold mine
Say they want my soul? can't do it, I ain't got one
This reaper music, reaper music, reaper music ho
The devil's keepers music, you gotta listen to it
This reaper music, reaper music, reaper music ho
The devil's keepers music, you gotta listen to it
