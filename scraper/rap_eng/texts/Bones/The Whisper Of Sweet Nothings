If you ever need you can call on me
If you ever need you can call on me
If you ever need you can call on me
If you ever need you can call on me
You will never have to scream wait up
I will be right here when you wake up
You will never have to scream wait up
I will be right here when you wake up
And that's the way we do it all the time
It doesn't matter when or why
Oh I've got something oh I've got something to tell you now
You know I love you so you know I'd never let you go
Oh I've got something oh I've got something to tell you now
