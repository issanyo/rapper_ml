(Verse: Bones)
See all the females love me, so all the boyfriends hate me
She'd rather be with Bones, but you take her ass on dates
She keep calling my phone, she hate that she gotta wait
For you to go back home, and then Team Sesh she play
My voice bang through her speakers, she close her eyes, she see me
My pictures up on her wall, she look at me till she sleeping
She see me when she dreaming, she think of me when she reading
She think of me when she buying a new ounce from her dealer
There's something bout that gold chain, something bout that white skin
Something bout that pimp named Bones that got her feeling a lil frightened
But I bet you that she like it, my ring shining like lightning
My trunk banging like thunder, light my blunt and then I'm reclining

(Outro: Bones)
Bitch I'm cute, I know I'm sexy
I got the looks that drive the girls wild
I got the moves, that really move em
I send chills up and down their spines
I'm just a sexy boy, I'm not your boy toy
