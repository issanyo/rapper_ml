[Verse: Bones]
I'm in the bathhouse, smoking Backwoods
Ash on the stone, steam filling up the room
Fresh fruit, cold water, let me breathe
Open up my eyes, everything Japanese
Blade always with me, your bitch, she with me too
Ever since she seen me, she know I seen her too
Have her for the night, I'll see that bitch soon
Climbing out the window, while I'm putting on my jewels
Walking through the river, water in my shoes

[Interlude: Spirited Away sample]
Haku, listen. I just remembered something from a long time ago, I think it may help you. Once, when I was little, I dropped my shoe into a river. When I tried to get it back, I fell in. I thought I'd drown but the water carried me to shore. It finally came back to me. The river's name was the Kohaku river. I think that was you, and your real name is Kohaku River

[Chorus: Bones]
Walking through the river, water in my shoes
Trying to find my way back to where I found you
Walking through the river, water in my shoes
Trying to find my way back to where I found you
