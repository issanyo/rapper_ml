[Verse 1]
Trying hardly, never stop me
Never top me, I'm sure like Pauly
I hope you got me, try to rob me
Leave you sopping, now you need a napkin
Just be good like Johnny, chains on like growing up Gotti
Don't ask me who I hate when you know that the answer's everybody
Creep up, touch anybody
Panting like I been jogging
Run up, no talking 'bout it
You think we straight, I doubt it
Doubt it, doubt it, you know I doubt it
Doubt it, doubt it, you know I doubt it

[Pre-Hook]
I don't give a fuck
Whether you and your friends even fuck with us
It would be a dream
If I woke to discover you turn to dust

[Hook]
Please get the fuck back, get the fuck back
Please get the fuck back, get the fuck back
Please get the fuck back, get the fuck back
Please get the fuck back, get the fuck back
Please get the fuck back, get the fuck back
Please get the fuck back, get the fuck back
Please get the fuck back, get the fuck back
Please get the fuck back, get the fuck back
What?
