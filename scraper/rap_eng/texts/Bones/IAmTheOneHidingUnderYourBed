[Verse]
Sesh
I remain the god of the underground
Everlasting corpse I go a hundred rounds
Step up and I will glitch you out of bounds
On mute, I will get you without a sound
Yeah you got a hundred chains but ain't got a crown
We all know what it say on your bustdown
Drip drip bling blou, okay what now?
That ain't gon' help when the dark devour
You and yours blackout on your team
Clap on clap off when we face to face, bitch
All bets off, if you reach for us you get your arms clipped off (What)
Like a knife through butter
You are just a meal that barely quench the hunger (Fuck)
I don't know why I love it
Probably 'cause I know what you did like it's last summer
I'm the shadow in the rafters, metal on drywall
Listen to the scratching (Bones)
Bones never been passive
If I get agitated I will end your passion (Yeah)
Notice I ain't say career
I can't give em too much credit if they started last year (No)
You're too new to shit and that includes you, bitch
You act too big for your britches, get neutered bitch
I ain't confused, no this shit ain't Clue you bitch
I will flip my faces like Guess Who and shit
They wanna be me, that's some big shoes to fit
You boys need an Oscar
Act but can't rap, you a whole imposter
You ain't scary, you a creepypasta
And me I ain't human I'm a real life monster

[Outro]
Fuck who you kick it with, I come all alone
Pull up at your home, put that razor to your dome
Fuck who you kick it with, I come all alone
Pull up at your home, put that razor to your dome
