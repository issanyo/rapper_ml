[Hook]
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him

[Verse 1]
I came through to collect, I am collateral debt
My molecular structure only got two presets
I could rot to the core and leave a trail with my flesh
Or turn to the universe and turn your world to a mess
I shoulder all these burdens without breaking a sweat
And if they wanna come and test I fight em off with my chest
Both hands up high holding up all thats left
I'll let it drop the day I do and now the planets at rest

[Hook]
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him

[Verse 2]
Went from laminated tile to brown granite stone
Turn the carpet on the floor to a light grained oak
Back hurts cause I don't sit up right
Last night was up dopin' 'til the Sun was the light
Day before was floatin' on the water eyes shut tight
Don't wake me 'less you got some pressed juice on ice
Don't hit me 'less the conversation ends with a price
Don't fuck with me and act like I've known you for life
'Cause that would be a lie, 'cause that would be a lie

[Hook]
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him
