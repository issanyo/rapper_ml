[Bones]
Too many places
Too many faces
Too many names to forget, just face it
Sometimes we all just need some time on our own to think
And I think my time is now
Cuz I can feel it in my bones
Today I started to grow
Apart from friends that I don't know

Somebody get me out of here
And take me to a place where noone knows my name
I need to be alone for now
I need to be alone for now

[Tom DeLonge]
Is it this air that turns me cold?
This time of year I feel alone
The wind blows and dries my skin
These people keep to themselves
All living in their own hell
I need to get out of the place I'm in

Take me to a place where I don't know anybody
Leave me alone for now
I've grown sick of every face that I've known
This keeps me up at night

See outside but you can't see in
My words don't penetrate the skin
Nothing will ever seem to get through
Walk past your problems and your fears
The ones you love are left in tears
Nothing will ever seem to phase you

Take me to a place where I don't know anybody
Leave me alone for now
I've grown sick of every face that I've known
This keeps me up at night

I can't let go, I'll break, I'll fold
It's got to be this air that's killing me
I know alone is all I've known
And it's old and I'm cold, yeah, but it doesn't phase me

Take me to a place where I don't know anybody
Leave me alone for now
I've grown sick of every face that I've known
This keeps me up at night
