[Verse]
Everybody talk about guns
Everybody talk about drugs
Everybody wanna be everybody else
But me? I never gave a fuck (no)
I don't get along with the ones that tag along.
Bitch I'd rather be on my own.
Switchblade holdin'
Backwoods folding
Young dumb fuck with a sock full of dope
101 hoes in a limousine rose
No phone, up late
Try to get it can talk
All I ever do is flow
All I ever do is smoke
Couldn't take my life cause I'm already gone
Everybody wanna be next
Everybody wanna be the best
They know us but we don't know them
Everybody just wanna be SESH
