[Verse]
Droppin' down hoppin' out straight out the casket
Pop lock and drop ya like Huey done asked me
Mud on my corpse, if you crazy I'm batshit
Bones is the one the game hate with a passion
When did it start, I think I know
The second I chose to come out of my tomb
Everyone gather and hold hands
And let out a big "Fuck you Bones" on two
One two, coming through
Your crew look like too wong foo
Give a fuck about your loot
Motherfucker gimme truth
And if you all out of the latter I'mma have to take the first
Try to bop me for my spot
Hold up, someone get this boy a hearse

[Hook]
I'm taking the long way home tonight
I just need some space, I don't wanna live today
Ran into the crow of the afterlife
He opened up his beak whispered, "Bones, please come with me"
Deadboy, what big eyes you have
The better to see you with
Hands of the witch cursed with one grip
I will rise from the fire
Finna blow away with the breeze
Reporting live from the core
Making it hard to breathe
