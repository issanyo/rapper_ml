[Hook]
I don't know
I'm worthless
I don't know
You don't deserve this

[Verse]
No guns, no guns, just a young, dumb fuck
Trouble boy makin' noise rollin' young, dumb blunts
I don't got no diamonds in my teeth
I don't got no lean up in my glass
All I do is roll my dope just to help the time pass
Young Gordon Bombay, got these blades on me
Got some ice up in my veins make the whole world freeze
What?
Gorgeous

[Hook]
I don't know
I'm worthless
I don't know
Do you deserve this?
