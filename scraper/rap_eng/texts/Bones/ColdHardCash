[Intro]
You have no idea what it could do
SESH
Captain
Uh-Oh
Prepare the female bandicoot

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary

[Verse: Bones]
Drugs all in my system
Bet my mama sure gon' miss me
Pour that codeine in my throat
'Till these walls get to dripping
Got these hoes all in the pole
And they all gon' get to strippin'
Got your bitch closed on the floor
And your girl up against that wall, and she
Drop it
Drop it
Down to the floor
24 blocks, I ain't even twenty-fo'
I pick my weapons like, "eeny, meeny, miny, moe"
Hop up in the limo then I hit the fuckin' corner store, now
Countin' cold hard cash in my limousine
Shug rags floors glass full of that promethazine
Big water slides
Big flat screens
Blank check life, Macintosh with the green
Been around the block
Seen a lot of death
Paid a lot of dues
Paid a lot of debts
Still, I keep that Glock when I leave my spot
Cuz you never know when shit might pop
Off at any given moment on the clock

[Chorus: Pimp C]
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Fuckin' up the game, bitch ya gets no love
Hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
