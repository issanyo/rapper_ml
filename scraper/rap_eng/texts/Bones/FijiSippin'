[Verse]
Fiji water, I'm sippin'
Chrome cover my kitchen
Wood floor when I'm walkin' on
Gold faucet stay drippin'
Ridin' on a broom breathes spillin' in the room
When I step inside the house
Bitches Know that it's who (BONES)
I'm smokin' up on that cancer
I'm young white and I'm handsome
I'm feeling something like Ted Danson the way I'm always flexin'
I'm floatin on down the river
I'm Cold but I never Shiver
Bitch I've been froze since Jim Carrey was the Riddler
Blast door Knives, Oriental Rugs
Smokin' dope up in the sauna, then its off to get some brunch
Sourdough bread with the vinaigrette
I can tell you a lil more but I ain't finna' to flex
Tryin to eat, tryin to sleep tryin to breathe tryin to SESH
Tryin to eat, tryin to sleep tryin to breathe tryin to SESH

[Outro]
Smoking all alone  smoking all alone
Smoking all alone, smoking all alone
