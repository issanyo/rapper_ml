[Verse]
Catacomb creep, buried last week
But I came back just to witness your defeat
Worms in my teeth, mud on my body
Used to ride shawty with my hand on the shotty
Dial 5-1-7
Before the next 7 if you trying to get connected (what)
Don't look in the attic
I don't need an extra case while I'm running through the madness (SESH)
Too clean can't miss it, Clorox, boy, two blunts disinfected
Weeping willows steady hanging
Set the mood perfect, I just hope it start raining
You shot your shot and you missed (brick)
I step in quick and go swish (bitch)
I go so swish they don't tic-tic
Our shows be like [?] god damn [?]
Checking this shit off my wishlist
Tell me one person that's this-this
Deal with these kids like "tisk-tisk!"
They know my position is infinite
Never get low cause I always re-up
This is what dreams are made up of and I am Hillary Duff
Bum and a youngin, and I'm about to erupt
I suggest it's on eggshells around me you walk
Better be a sweetheart if you want to talk
If not, guess what, you get fucked
Painted on horns but a halo's what you got
Acting devilish get you burned on the spot

[Outro]
Spot, get you burned on the spot
Acting devilish get you burned on the spot
Yeah, get you burned on the spot
