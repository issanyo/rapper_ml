[Hook 1]
Can you stand the rain?
New Edition, like the calendar say '88
Matte black trench coat with the razor straight
Make ya drop and give me 20 like Major Payne
Now they signing off to majors for the lamest change
Trying to justify it like it's always been the dream
They go with the scheme, I evolve with my team
No label attached, no strings on me, can you?
Can you stand the rain?
New edition like the calendar say '88
Matte black trench coat with the razor straight
Make ya drop and give me 20 like Major Payne

[Post-Hook]
Ever since we came up, don't know how to act
Now I need a pack just to help me relax
Ever since we came up, don't know how to act
Looking at the map, only way to know where I'm at
Ever since we came up, don't know how to act
Now I need a pack just to help me relax
Ever since we came up, don't know how to act
Looking at the map, only way to know where I'm at
What, What

[Verse]
Close the doors and quickly, I'm calling order
I'm swiftly when I'm recording, distorted until the morning
I'm flowing, it's kinda hard when you mourning
Don't disregard it, you're with me forever, promise you
Memories never tarnish, the second I heard you calling
Time I thought we have more of
Life reminds you seconds that we got are always going
All is unimportant when you lose someone important
Cannot render thoughts, let alone the words to export them

[Hook 2]
Can you stand the rain?
New Edition, like the calendar say '88
Matte black trench coat with the razor straight
Make ya drop and give me 20 like Major Payne
Now they signing off to majors for the lamest chains
Trying to justify it like it's always been the dream
They go with the scheme, I evolve with my team
No label attached, no strings on me, can you?
