[Verse 1]
Change all the locks and move the furniture all around
Paint the room with a different shade pull all the blinds down
I wanna barely recognize this place that I call home
The world steady turning at a different pace I can't follow

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want to feel alive
Shiver down my spine I want wind in my eyes
Blood on my skin let it shine in the light
Reaper on my side I don't ever gotta die

[Chorus]
I'm all in thats forever you are in
No I'd rather death is slow, life is faster
Yes I know a new chapter if I told you I'm after you, that means I'm the latter
I hope I follow up on all these things
I hope I'm holding up to the standards you set
Then again you have always been

[Outro]
Then again you have always been
Then again you have always been
Then again you have always been
Then again you have always been
Then again you have always been
