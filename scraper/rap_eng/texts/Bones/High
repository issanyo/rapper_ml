[Hook - Eddy Baker] x2

Shorty wanna ride with me
Spend all of her time with me
Roll up and get high with me
Bumpin' and grind with me

[Verse 1 - Eddy Baker]

Bitch
Smokin' dope
On my mac shit and it's not a joke
You jack me i'm cuttin' hoes
X-Man when I turn into a ghost
Squeezin' out, I do the most
All hoes jealous of my new chicks
Everything I do I abuse it
Sprite with the lean I fuse it
Niggas be sleepin' on the kid
Bones tell these guys we do this
So many girls I think I wanna 'em all cuz I can't figure out whose the cutest
BRK, Team SESH
All day, we up next
Grown man how I fuck that bitch but I've been doin' this since team sex
Underground kings and my team fresh
Pull a nigga chick with finesse
Always at heart see it through my chest
Take it to the max, I'ma do my best
She rollin' with the winners cuz she tired of you losers
What I'm sayin' is you suck and me and my team we way cooler that's why

[Hook - Eddy Baker] x2

Shorty wanna ride with me
Spend all of her time with me
Roll up and get high with me
Bumpin' and grind with me

[Verse 2 - Bones]

She overdose on drugs now her eyes back in her skull
Exorcist whenever she flip she got two acid tabs on her tongue
She is Team SESH 'till I'm done
But I'm ridin' round with that klan and you downs cover my bones I got that razor up in my hand
See I've been lurkin' up in them shadows
That silhouette in that alleyway
Hood up my head high see the moon shine sippin' Alize
Shallow Days on my stereo
Tell me what's that scenario
Fuckin' life say fuckin' stay I don't give a fuck about your area code no

[Hook - Bones]

Shorty wanna ride with me
Spend all of her time with me
Roll up and get high with me
Bumpin' and grind with me
