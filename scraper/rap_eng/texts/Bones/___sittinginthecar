We were sitting in the car with the radio on
We were at a red light i looked at you and saw you in the light
Never seen such life as we slowly took a left
It never felt so right
I would always be the first one to say that this world
Holds nothing but you have changed my way
Now i see everything
You have changed my way
You are everything
