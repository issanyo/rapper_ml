[Intro]
Sesh, Bones

[Verse]
See I don't like a bitch if she looking like Ke$ha
And I don't like a bitch if she acting like she better
See I don't talk to 'em cause they change like the weather
In the winter they fall back and act cold like December
Cup of syrup for dinner
Motherfuck that chicken
They try to get me to sign
I'm saying fuck that business, cause I don't like it
No I don't
Ridin' 'round in that low
Low sitting low on 24's
Rims poking out like whoa
I'm stepping out on the scene
It's feeling like it's 9-3
It's sounding like it's 9-6
But the bitch is from the 90's
See I'm rapping fast but I'm smoking slow
Shredded jeans, young Casey Jones
Going hard when I'm coming down
Randy Johnson when I'm getting (whoa)

[Hook]
What you know about it
What you know about it
Yeah, What you know about it
I'm riding in the caddy with the chrome on the body
Swanging lane to lane with the blunt hanging, naughty
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, bitches know that it's
Bones, Bones, Bones
I be coming with the flow, flow, flow
You already, you already

[Outro]
Sesh
