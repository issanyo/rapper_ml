[Verse 1]
You know just what I think
Before I even think
How do you do that to me

[Hook]
My favorite part of waking up is you
If I didn't have that
I think that I would just fall right through
Oh I'd fall, oh I'd fall right down to none I swear

[Outro]
My favorite part of waking up is you
My favorite part of waking up is you
