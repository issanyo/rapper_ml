[Verse]
If I forgot what I knew, then I would be just like you
To live in such ignorance must be a blessing, if I were you, fuck, I'd be over the moon
If I forgot what I do, then I would still look for the truth
Whether it's painting or gardening, I would find happiness within any route
I hope you get money to spend and think that it's good 'til the end
Then realizations, they knock at your door when you don't got no choice but to go let 'em in

[Hook]
Like a bad dream
Like a bad dream
