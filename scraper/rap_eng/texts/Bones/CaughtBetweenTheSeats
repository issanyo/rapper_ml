[Hook]
Never will I ever just understand
The happenings that happen inside my head
Even if I drop down, break both legs
I will crawl to a place where no one stays
Carry the leaves to the top of the trees
Is all I see when I read the scene
Adaptation when I leave my dreams
Relaxation, lungs all they breathe
Body's home but inside is bleak
In the middle, caught between the seats

[Verse]
I am the ice that is melted in front of the fridge
Late in the night, I still adjust to the light
Stopping inside of a feeling that opens your eyes
Think that you've had it all worked out now
Think that you've had it all worked out now
Think that you've had it all worked out now
Think that you've had it all worked out now

[Bridge]
Don't gotta tell, no, don't got a story
Don't got no worries 'cause I'm just as before
Don't gotta tell, no, I don't got a story
Don't got no worries 'cause I'm just as before
Just as before
Just as before

[Hook]
Never will I ever just understand
The happenings that happen inside my head
Even if I drop down, break both legs
I will crawl to a place where no one stays
Carry the leaves to the top of the trees
All I see when I read the scene
Adaptation when I leave my dreams
Relaxation, lungs all they breathe
Body's home but inside is bleak
In the middle, caught between the seats
