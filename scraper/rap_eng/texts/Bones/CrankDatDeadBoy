[Hook]
Lean to the right, then I lean to the left
Hundred blunts to the neck, now I feel like death
Crank that dead boy
Crank that dead boy
Crank that dead boy
Crank that dead boy
Lean back, let it snap, do your thang on that bitch, boy
It's 2007, let it bang on a bitch
Crank that dead boy
Crank that dead boy
Crank that dead boy

[Verse 1: Bones]
Stepping on the scene in some cold white Bapes
Rubberband wrist with the princess cut chain
I be pulling out the lot, four wheeler switching lanes
Clich√© everything, bling bling, golden ring
Bathtub full of cash, 5% up on the glass
[?] the lights, take your life when I pass
Hundred one dimebags, smoking so the time pass
Jolly Rancher candy paint, dripping like the pipes bad
People call me ice man, chain like a lighthouse
T-Mobile sidekicking, Bones so iced out
13 beepers, I got 36 phones
62 whips and they all on chrome
Couple butter seats, bitch, my leather so soft
Somewhere in your city with the top blown off
Money out the roof, bitch, we all dying soon
Step right, step left as I dance to my tune, aye

[Hook]
Lean to the right, then I lean to the left
Hundred blunts to the neck, now I feel like death
Crank that dead boy
Crank that dead boy
Crank that dead boy
Crank that dead boy

[Verse 2: Na$ty Matt]
Bet you can't do it like me, I been dead
Starting to see space ships on Bankhead
Sidekick filled up with blockheads
Rubberband Man, keep the block fed
Lean back then pop and roll
Pop 3 pills then we pop some more
Pop the fo' and drink it slow
You pass away and that's how it goes
Money, rolls, cars and clothes, that's how all my partners roll
Black hearse on 24's, that's how all the dead boys roll
Multi-colored Bathing Ape, looking like a star
Paint dripping, pussy dripping when I step out of the car
When I pull up to the scene, I can tell they don't like me now
Evisu jeans, make a bobblehead wipe me down
Put your number in my phone, then leave me 'lone
VVS stones, leave the herringbone at home
Freak in the black, Bones breaking down a sack
Lean back then snap, let your bones crack and fall back
Pop a pill, that make you wanna kill
Lean back, do your dance, and then you're dead for real

[Hook]
Lean to the right, then I lean to the left
Hundred blunts to the neck, now I feel like death
Crank that dead boy
Crank that dead boy
Crank that dead boy
Crank that dead boy
Lean to the right, then I lean to the left
Hundred blunts to the neck, now I feel like death
Crank that dead boy
Crank that dead boy
Crank that dead boy
Crank that dead boy
