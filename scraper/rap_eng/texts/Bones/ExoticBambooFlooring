[Verse 1]
Bathhouse smoking, TeamSESH on my robe
Blowing up smoke til the ceiling of the room
Bamboo floor and my neck made of jewels
Cool when you got so far so soon
Feeling like a kid again, anything I drew
I could bring to life, now I feel like I do
Poison in my veins, I left too soon
Wish that you were here written on my tomb (what?)
No, don't talk to me
You better run from me
Gather up your drug money
Better call company
You gon' need it all if you really wanna run shit
Banshee in the river see me once and it's done bitch

[Hook]
Sesh, til' I rest (til' I rest, wait)
Sesh, (yes, yes, yes) til' I rest (til' I rest)
Never stop, no
Never stop, no
