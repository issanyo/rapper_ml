[Verse]
Fuck a diamond in the rough, throw it back in the dirt
Told the voices in my head to take a hike and it worked
Now there are days I feel so clear I see through solid objects
I see the front yard from the kitchen, neighbors think I'm walling
Yelling that you balling, ah, is that what you call it?
I call it how I see it, all I see is nothing
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire

[Hook]
(BoyOhBoy) I could never let it go
(BoyOhBoy) I could never let it go
(BoyOhBoy) I could never let it go
(BoyOhBoy) I could never let it... Bones
