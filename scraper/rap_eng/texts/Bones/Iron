[Verse]
I've been smoking, browsing, looking at commercial spaces
Bones been saving about to crack the bank and make the place
That we can make shit
I'm gonna make sure we straight with every check its half I'm stashing
Put that on myself we better than well off I promise you that shit
Use to camp for grams working hand to cans
Pushing pressing printing cashing for some rashions when we can
Fuck is good the answers us
Came from blunts of angel dust
Mudbog, hunt dogs on the trail
And you know that they looking for us, bitch hurry up
Canvas face, oil features, Prussian blue inside my liter
Liquid white when I slice get bleeding
Legends every step we leading
Give you eyes to help you read
Lend you mine to help you see
The scenic route, the truth
The hidden path you thought there would never be
Look for me you'll never see
Only chance is in your dreams
Think of me before you sleep
And hope that leeches through the sheets
Mirror mirror on the wall
One day you will show me me
Till then I will float around this house
And tell them all to leave

[Hook]
Leave, leave tell them all leave
Leave, leave tell them all leave
Leave, leave tell them all leave

[Outro]
Please don't make me ask you twice
Please I'm not going to ask you nice
Please don't make me ask you twice
Please I'm not going to ask you nice
