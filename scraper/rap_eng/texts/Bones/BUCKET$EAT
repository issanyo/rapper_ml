[Verse]

Ok I'm cruisin' in my bucket seat, comfortably, bitch fuck with me
A billion for the watch, that's nothin' I'm livin' comfortably
Never ballin' on a bugetsy I'm in the lap of luxury
Marble refrigerators in my 3D navigator
Pop the trunk just for the haters, let em see us let em hate
Cuz I just love bein' a pimp, I won't let that go to waste
Got that banger on my waist
If you tryna get in my face with all that shit, fuck off bitch I'm bouta split I'm bouta dip I'm bouta parlay

[Hook - Troop]

You know what you like dont waste no time
Be mine if you like the way i parlay tonight we can make it right thats fine if you like the way i parlay you're fine i wanna make you mine if its time baby we can really parlay tonight i can blow your mind (i know you) i know you like the way i parlay
