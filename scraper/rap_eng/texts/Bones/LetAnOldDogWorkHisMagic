[Verse 1: Bones]
.Hack brains grippin' twin kite blades
Sword Art Online, once they login they don't leave bitch
Guild, bank, boom, and that mean everybody eatin'
TeamSESH, DeadBoys, get it while everybody's sleepin'
The Livingston County scumbag, used to lay them thumbtacks
Now we all cashed, walking shoes with the dust back
Keep all duffled, El holdin' all the bundles
No security needed, if we got it then we touch it
From the rubbage, still dusting
Where the tiles getting muddy
Backroads, no lights, don't get lost if you ain't from here
Can't stand human beings, understand what I mean
Every time I go out I see results of what they bring
No grass, just roads, no life just mold
Bitch we all just trash on the side of the road (what?)
