[Verse 1: Ethelwulf]
I'm out here sittin', uh
I'm out here sittin', uh (waaahh)
I'm out here sittin' down on the ground
I see spirits coming down now
I think they really want me now, now
Cause I got the sharpest sword in town
I see this girl but she won't turn around
And I think I know the reason now
She got blood all over her gown
I feel like a nigga dead now
What's that saying they be saying now?
What don't kill you will come back around
They better stay up out the way now
Or I will slam every day now (waaah)
I'm smoking weed, tryna' keep count
But the blood spills around my house (what?)
Round one, till the time's out
Round two, I'm gonna kill you now (waaaah)
Don't get mad, nigga don't be sad
You hating on me cause I'm smoking sacks
I got something just for all of that
Then kill him and bring that body back (waaah)
Bitch

[Verse 2: Bones]
What, what, what
What
Feeling something like Aaron Carter
Beat Shaq then I fuck your daughter
Lean back and turn up the Sqad Up
Pick a fucking rapper, bet I'm going harder
Kitchen knife in my right pocket, black bandanna wrapped 'round that bitch
I pour a cup, I roll a blunt
I flick ash then I down that bitch
I ain't tryna' be your favorite, I'd rather that you hate me (legend)
Young X-Pac, I'm throwing suck its, your girlfriend wanna date me (fuck)
Your first love wanna rape me (rape me), your new girl wanna take me (take me)
Into her room, cut off the lights, turn on the SESH and get naked (aye)
You faking, I'm rapping (SESH), see when you're sad, I'm happy (Bones)
You still at home in your mama's basement
My style clean, you nappy (fuck it)
Your whole shit just tacky, my whole team Boombastic
Your bitch and angel I fucking got, so like Shao Kahn I'm laughing
It wasn't me when you ask her, peaches and cream when she gasping (ah)
She take it all, she got no shame
She sees Bones, it's that master
No matter what I say my skin is white, so they always gon' hate me (SESH)
They think I'm trying, my fucking rhyming got females going crazy
Legend, what
