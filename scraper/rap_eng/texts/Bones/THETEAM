[Verse 1]

It's 4 in the morning, we ridin' round we rollin'
We seshin'
We smokin'
We go till we jokin'
We fall asleep in Oakland, we wake up in Paris
We all around the world, kickin' raps and gettin higher

[Hook]

The motherfuckin' team, ya you already know
The motherfuckin' team bumpin' our your stereo
The motherfuckin' team
Ya
The motherfuckin' team
