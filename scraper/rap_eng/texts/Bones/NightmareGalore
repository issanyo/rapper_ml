[Verse 1: Bones]
Fresh out the morgue, dope in my pores
Yelling in pain while I'm screaming for more
Every night for me is nightmare galore
The echoes of whispers they leak through the wall
Blood is too hot, hands are too cold
My temperature is fucked, it's beyond my control
Same with emotions, I never had hold
Of anything regarding feelings at all
Roller-coaster, hold my breath
The city look miniature, the people turn to ants
Roll over the edge, only focused on chance
Will I make it off safe or will I drop on the tracks
No one's safe, we all get ate
Up and consumed by the nebular beast
Living on the edge of its mouth and its teeth
Planet will end any second that it needs
Shake off bacteria, time to get clean
Watch as we fall to the darkest of seas
We the disease, don't know what it means
To ever be sync with the soil and breeze

[Verse 2: Eddy Baker]
Posted with mobsters, came with the Contra
Grams in my boxers, get cheese like Wisconsin
Nigga talk shit, beat his ass like a boxer
Mob talk with mobsters, get shot at the opera
Bitch I'm not studious, fuck up and ruin shit
Iced out my wrist cuz I robbed all the jewelers shit
Run with tough guys, you can't hang because you a bitch
So many hoes on my dick, don't know who to kiss
Rotten and ruthless, bust at a pig like Duke Nukem, bitch
Hit a fuck boy with Hadouken kicks, niggas is rookies I do this shit
I'm rapping and swerving, stacking and earning
Tryna run up, you'll take one in the sternum
Young dumb and paid, used to be dumb and poor man
Take all your shit and your money like Birdman
