[Hook: Bones]
You know we got our weight up
Every night and every time we let the stage up
Skyline view let’s you know we raised up
Teach you shit we couldn’t teach you how we came up

[Eddy Baker]
Came up, looked like a criminal
Killing shows and getting dough
Chicks chasing after us
They look like mob figures bro
Looking at my minerals you talking to the general
Healthy Boyz bitch probably heard us in your living room
Sold out at the venue too
Know we fucked the party up
All these rappers tired of us
Ain’t got no boss can’t fire us
Know we spark that fire up
Rolling like a tire bruh
Came up from the bottom now our idols our admirers

[Hook]
[Bones]
Started these tunes from out of the basement
Now we filling the whole place up
I see they face now they can’t face it what I’ve been tellings amazing
So here we our again
Just walking our city streets that I know so well
So get the fuck back with all your negativity I swear it radiates from you
I swear it radiates from you
