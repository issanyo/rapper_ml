[Intro]
SESH
Bones

[Verse 1: Bones]
Say, you walk up in the club, throw a couple bands up
Now you think that bitches gonna like you
Say you hoppin' out the Coupe with antennas up on the roof
Like them bitches gonna slide right through
We don't give a fuck about how much you putting up
Oh no, we don't care enough about your shit to look it up
Not impressed by your ego or the human you become
Just a slave to the trends, another grave for the young
We know you got the money and we know you got the clothes
But what the fuck that mean if the shit don't go
We know you got the bone, and we know your name known
But what the fuck that mean if the shit don't go
What?
SESH is the reason they fuck every season
No stop for a breather until we stop breathing
We got what they need and we drop and they fiendin'
We get like they suffer, we kill and we leave it
Nobody comparable, bitches hysterical
I don’t show up in the mirror it’s a miracle
Rap is the area, fuck what they carrying
Up on the back of the whips so I carry it
I'd be embarrassed if I were you
Take a step back and just look what you do
I'd be embarrassed if I were you
Take a step back and just look what we do
