[Hook]
I see you in my dreams
I see you in my dreams, bitch
I see you in my dreams
I see you in my dreams, bitch

[Verse]
Shut my eyes and then I think of you
Rollin' blunts on my fuckin' stoop
I ain't ridin' 'round in no Bentley coupe
I ain't trappin' bricks, I ain't 'bout to shoot
I don't really talk too much
But just know that I'm always watchin'
See I don't really like you much
But I'mma give you a chance so just watch, watch
Watch me, I'mma show you how
Young white pimp and I'm puttin' it down
Young Timberlake, I'm so N'sync
I'm rollin' blunts while I'm comin' down
Bitches know that it's Bones
Razor blade in my palm
Got ancient silk on my body
I'm feelin' like I'm in Rome

[Hook]
I see you in my dreams
I see you in my dreams, bitch
I see you in my dreams
I see you in my dreams, bitch

[Outro]
