[Hook]
Ridin' in the car with it
Lyin' under stars with it
Stop then I part with it
I ain't gonna start with it
Lightin' up cigars with it
Smoking and livin' large with it
Do it 'fore you're gone bitch
Dead in designer clothes bitch

[Verse 1]
Ash on the floor, I'm cashed, so you know
Don't expect me to move, no, don't expect me to choose
Dopin' on the road, I'm coping with the thoughts
You know that all my blinds closed, you know I never leave home
Did you ever think that (maybe)
I would ever make that (crazy)
No one ever knew me (honest)
Now they all on me (stop it)
Sittin on my profits, applause is a promise
Young scumbag never thought about college
No, I'm not clean bitch
No I'm not nice
Just 'cuz you making music too don't mean we alright
