[DJ Downuts]
Well, it's came to an end
Fucking finally
That was dreamcatcher
And I'm DJ Downuts
And this is Lil' Johnny
Lil' Johnny, say goodbye

[Lil' Johnny]
Goodbye

[DJ Downuts]
That's right
New little diddy I learned on the keys
Been tickling the ivories
But, uh, far belong in some short horn cities
A comedy road to nowhere
Coming soon
Keep SESH
That kid
Fuck yourself
