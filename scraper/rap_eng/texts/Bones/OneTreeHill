[Verse 1: Dylan Ross]
All these notions that you have about me
I can see they are beyond control
I can feel you from a distance, baby
I can feel you from the earth below
I am ready, I am ready
There is nothing for me here
I am ready, I am ready
I just cannot wait 'til next year
When I leave this place

[Verse 2: Bones]
I let my hair down just so
You don't see how I feel
I'll let my guard down one day
'Til then I'm locked in here
