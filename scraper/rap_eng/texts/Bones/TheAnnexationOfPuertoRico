[Verse]
Standing staring at the wall in my tomb
Thinking maybe I could show the world soon
Light's shooting through the cracks in the roof
Fingers tracing all the etches in my ruins
Ear to the ground so I know when they comin'
Know it's us pulling up when you see them boys runnin'
It's a bittersweet sprint cause I can tell that they love it
Cause they've never known another like us, let's be honest
I don't say that I'm the best, I just tell 'em that I'm SESH
Break my neck, fuck a check, bitch I do it like I'm hexed
Since the womb, been consumed by  the planet I was grew
Bad seed, bad roots, bad sun, bad youth

[Hook x4]
I don't fuck with the world
Give a fuck 'bout the world
