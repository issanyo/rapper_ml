[Intro]
SESH

[Verse]
Jump in like fuck is a drop
I be everything you not
Your biggest fear is the one in the mirror
Doesn't steer you the way you would want
Hands on the wheel let the time just pass
'Till no more sand in the hourglass
Slipped through the middle to fall and confirm
That you still got nothing now what did we learned
Waiting for something that's never to show
Kept the light on 'till you  burnt out the bulb
Wait up or get up and do what you set up
Or complain forever about steps that weren't taken

[Hook]
I pity you
But I got no time, I get rid of you
Hang 'em out to dry, no interview
No talking, just you and BONES alone in the darkness
Pity you
But I got no time, I get rid of you
Hang 'em out to dry, no interview
No talking, just you and BONES alone in the darkness

[Outro]
What
SESH
I can never picture going on if you ain't with me
Empty I would be, I owe the apology
I can never picture going on if you ain't with me
Empty I would be, I owe the apology
