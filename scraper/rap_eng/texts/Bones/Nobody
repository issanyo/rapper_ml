Mr. Wizard?
Oh, hi Christian
Hi! Why is it so dark in here?
Well, you'll find out later. See that mark I have on the rug there?
Yes
Well, go stand on it
Okay
Okay, what do you see?
You
Okay now, I have magical powers in which I can take an X-Ray of myself, and all I have to do is a little twiddling down here, and now what do you see?
You're turning into a skeleton!
Yes, and in spite of the fact that I have disappeared and now I'm in the nether lether world, can you hear me alright?
Yes, I still can
Okay, good! And I also have enough magical powers to return to everyday life. Watch
Whoa! You're coming back!
Yes, and now I'm back whole again, right?
Right
Now you can do this trick, or version of it, at home. In fact, I'll turn on the lights and show you how

[Verse 1]
While you're out there settling
I will turn to a skeleton
All you've ever longed for is relevance

Some might say I'm heaven sent
I just say they're full of shit because
I never asked for this
We never asked, we never asked for this
Now nobody wants me
Now nobody wants me
Now nobody wants me
Aaah
