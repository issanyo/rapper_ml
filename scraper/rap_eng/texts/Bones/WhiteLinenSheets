[Hook]
I'm ready to go
Cause I just want to see you again
I'm ready to go, I just need to see you, friend
I don't want to go, if you're not right there
I don't want to go, no I don't want to go
I don't want to go, don't want to go
Don't want to go

[Verse]
Bag of dope on the table, million blunts, now I'm able
Strung out in my living room, Netflix, no cable
Fresh water I drink, just fillin' up my HP
Boys close, weed to smoke, our raps are everything free
I'm feelin' something like Joe Dirt, old jeans, no shirt
Singin' like a white Ginuwine, only difference is my flow is perfect

[Hook]
I'm ready to go
Cause I just want to see you again
I'm ready to go, I just need to see you, friend
I don't want to go, if you're not right there
I don't want to go, no I don't want to go
I don't want to go, don't want to go
Don't want to go
