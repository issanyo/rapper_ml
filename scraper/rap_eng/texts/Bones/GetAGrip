[Intro]
What?
Ryze

[Verse 1]
Fuck where you’re at, fuck where you been
Fuck what you’re bumping if it ain’t the team
Fuck do you mean you’re the king of the ring?
You must’ve been popping too much of them beans
Living a dream but I’ll be your night
Terror wake you and take you on a flight
Off of the grid, into the mist
Missing forever, you will not be missed
Boy, get a grip, from the abyss
Came out of mist with conditions for grim
Wake up and piss, sleeping and shit
Life of a rat back in Michigan
If I go back, I will flip again
Blow up the block with the house that they in
Creeping, I dip to the Holiday Inn
Now Bones just got away with it again

[Hook]
Tick, tock, tick, tock
Tick, tock, time’s running out for ya
Tick, tock, tick, tock
Tick, tock, time’s running out for ya

[Verse 2]
Hit 'em with a one tap headshot dirt nap
Ridin' in a hearse with five percent
Tint on the front of the windshield
I can see you but you cannot see in
Rain, rain, come again
Drop top, feel the summer wind
Every year we do it again
We get it, we got it, you follow the trends
Go with the wind, whatever they do
You command+V every flow you got through
You look at me and you seeing right through
Got no reflection, no, that’s nothing new
That’s nothing new
That’s nothing new, yeah
That’s nothing new, yeah
What?

[Outro]
Hey guys, I'm here to talk to you about the new upcoming Doonkie Deluxe. It slices, it dices, and leaves everything smooth as butter, it's the doonger. We all remember those dinosaur chicken nuggets. Look at the end of the Doongie piece, it's a dinosaur stamp. You can literally stamp anything into a dinosaur. And if you call in the next 15 minutes, you will not only get one, but two mini Dongers (oh my god, it's not Dongers, it's Dingles!) and if you call in the next 15 minutes, you will also get a free mini thing. Call 1-800-366-4355. That's 1-800-DOONGLE, with two O's
