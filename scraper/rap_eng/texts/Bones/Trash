[Verse 1: Bones]
Back when we used to recycle our bottles and cans, just to get money for dope
Back when we hopped in the van, take what you can, now we buying the O
People that make it look strange, peep through my blinds 'cause I know that they know
Bitch, I've been up for some days, thinking of ways to get out of this hole
Hold up, bitch! Hold up, bitch!
I don't want a problem but if trouble's what you want then hold up, bitch
Came from the place where the basement was home
Now the traces are gone
Never be back, no, I never feel bad
But fuck it, I guess here we just tryna move on
Floating down the river with a wood lit
Camo so I'm blending with the wood, bitch
Everybody say they from the hood, eh
You ain't never been to the hood, bitch

[Verse 2: Xavier Wulf]
You know all of my niggas buck as fuck
They don't give a fuck about fucking shit up
And I don't give a fuck about showing niggas love
When I mean mug, I hit a fool then I shoulder shrug
I don't give a fuck if a bitch wanna fuck
All these hoes sluts so I don't let them touch
Nigga, shut the fuck up, fool, you ain't even tough
Trynna play me, I beat him down 'til I pick him up
Bitch nigga know who the damn FÃ¼hrer
You see my whole fleet, lil' bruh, count 'em up
Hundred million men finna fuck his life up
All I do is watch while the squad cut him up
Fuck a nigga mean, I woke up as a torturer
