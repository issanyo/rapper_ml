[Bones]
What's the word
What's the story 'bout
They wanna sound like me, I know it now
I pick you up just to put you down
Fuck around and leave you sleeping sound
I ain't got nothing to lose bitch
I'm like a new bitch
I'ont gotta do shit
Everything clean but the money
Everybody good but you
Everyday, everyday sunny
It only ever rains on you

[Hook]
Falling to the deep end
I can't breathe down here
Falling to the deep end
I can't breathe down here

[Dylan Ross]
Everyday it could be sad
Everyday it belongs to you
Everyday it could be your last
All you wanna do is change the past
Alone up in this world so isolate me down
When I make it out of here
Will I sink or drown
I will swim until my death if there's no shore around
I know giving up
I know how easy it sounds
You just want somebody you can give all your devotion
Nature is so staggering when it comes to emotion
I will be the one to pick you up when you are down
I will always be here, even when I'm not around
I've wasted my time
I've wasted yours too
I would have wrote home a thousand times
But I didn't wanna waste ink on you
I've wasted my time
I've wasted yours too
I would have wrote home a thousand times
But I didn't wanna waste ink on you
