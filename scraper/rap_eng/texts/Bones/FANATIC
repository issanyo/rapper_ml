Now a days rap music's a metaphor in a beat
Just dumbed down for dumb crowds to get what they mean
And all the sudden i'm getting all these pats on the back
From the same kids who used to hate when i say that i like rap
Like "hey i like it too now, you heard of wiz khalifa? curren$y? Mac Miller? Black and Yellow's my favorite"
It's just the same bullshit every time that i hear it
Thinkin' they so underground when they don't fuckin know the meaning
Just cause you went home and did some research on em
Downloaded the discography you think you been on em
But you fuckin been off em
And i know that thats a fact
Get to laughing every time you faggots say you like rap
What happened to baller blockin and throwin shots at artists when they slip up and use your name in their recordin'
What you know about wayne fool? he went and fuckin made it
Did you have dedication when he dropped dedication?
See, the problem with today, better yet with rap
You can go home and log on and download the pack
But still, you'll never know what it's like to be a fan
Signin off, the rap fanatic, establishin' 97'
