[Verse]
Ride or die
Suicide when I'm slidin' by
Dollar signs in my fucking eyes
Cock the blade back, and let it fly
Rolling, smoking, doping all day
Fuck with Bones and learn the hard way
Hallway, darkening, blunts so sparking
Lurking, certain that I'm harder
Glasshouse, metal door
Lavish living to the core
Diamond fridge, platinum sink
Marble counter, granite floor
Boyfriends hate me, bitches love me
Drinking nice and smoking lovely
Sitting pretty looking gorgeous
Every line is fucking flawless

[Hook]
Everything I do is flawless
Bling-bling, golden ring like it's calling
Every time I smoke it's flawless
Perfect rolled woods, perfect groomed garden
Everything I do is flawless
Bling -bling, golden ring like it's calling
Every time I smoke it's flawless
Perfect rolled woods, perfect groomed garden

[Outro]
Everything I do is flawless
Bling -bling, golden ring like it's calling
Everything I do is flawless
Bling -bling, golden ring like it's calling
