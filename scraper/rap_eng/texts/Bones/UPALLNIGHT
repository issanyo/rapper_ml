[Verse]

I'm mad you up all night
Layin' on your back with your legs in the air
I'm mad you up all night
Kissin' on the neck then she whisper in my ear say
Go, go, fast as you can
She pullin' on the sheets while I'm pullin' on her hair
And I ain't lettin' ya go but if you need a rest baby let me know
Whoooooaaaaa goin' through the motions
Up all night goin' deep as the oceans
Say lemme hear you scream
Put your face to the pillow lemme give you what you need to be up all night and
Fuckin' till the morning light
Lemme hear you scream whoa
Say ohhhhhohhhhhhohhhhhwhooooaaoaaoa
Up all night
