[Intro]
Clean, clean, clean..

[Verse]
I'm cool, I'm rad
I'm good, I'm bad
I'm cute, I'm hot
I'm dope, you not
I flow, you don't
I roll, I smoke
I'm crack, I'm coke
I'm high, I'm low
I'm glad you mad
I'm smilin', you sad
You lyin', you cryin'
You tryin' but can't
I'm sippin', I'm drinkin'
You home, you thinkin'
You see me, you wishin'
On my chains cause they glisten'
Like stars at night
You loose, I'm tight
I'm rappin', you can't
I'm water, I'm fire
I'm ground, I'm earth
I'm death, I'm birth
I'm clouds, I'm birds
[?]
You suck, I don't
I fuck, I [?]
I'm love, I'm hate
I'm everything that you ain't
You hear me, you copy
I'm clean, you sloppy
You pullin' up in [?]
Bitch I'm swervin' off in that 'Rari
Like it's 1996 again
Cold like it's Michigan
Yellow Testarossa what you find Bones whippin' man
Do this shit for my team
You can sip that lean
I'mma sip my water
I'mma spit so clean

[Outro]
Yeah, clean, clean, clean
What? yeah, yeah
Basically I'm clean, I'm clean
I'm clean, I'm clean
You suck
Really though, you're just a fan
Like, stop wastin' time in your life
Like you're gonna die and regret wastin'all your time try'na be somebody else
Fuck you
Sesh
