Case sensitive, re-enter
You're my lifeline, I just hope you answer
Been buffering, still loading
Bare with me, this should just take a moment
I know you know I notice
You are the greater of my focus
Gaussian blur if it's not you
Don't wanna see a scene without you

[Verse]
Bones logging on, blunt guts in my palm
On my pixelated lawn, I lag out then respawn
Seems like they create a player then just long to be known
Little do they know every second we're closer to the unknown
I don't need no Glock up on my waist, I don't need no you killing the game
I don't need no why you dont fuck with them, bitch, don't make me explain
Now the whole game hate me and I can understand
I would hate me too if I was any other man, what?
