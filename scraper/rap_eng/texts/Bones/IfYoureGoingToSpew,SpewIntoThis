[Verse]
Hold still it will all be over soon
Let me know if I can get you anything from the other room
Hold still, it's almost time for you
To come back to real life
I start to realize when I look in your eyes
The seconds turn to years when I'm touching your spine
And since we never age I forget about time
All my minutes spent letting you know youâ€™ve got all mine
My nails peel back and my eyelids rip
Everything up in my nightmares shroud me with mist
Tied up to the bow, going down with the ship
Spark a blunt with my toes just to get a last hit
