[Verse 1: Bladee]
I know its hopeless, crown of thorns, blood on the roses
Rob him for his Roshe, can I buy emotion
Pull up in a lotus, sitting next to Joseph
It's so hard to focus when everything is broken
I know that it's over, but I'm trying to hold on
You know that my soul's gone, but let me put this gold on
Gold on my girl, in the dream world
Rainworld of angels, shadow reaper

[Hook: Bladee]
Shadowface, make my city break, everything is fake
Bitter pain, make it go away, shadows on my face
Shadowface, make my city break, everything is fake
Bitter pain, make it go away, shadows on my face

[Verse 2: Bones]
Riding, sliding, smoking dope
If you want it, let me know
Zoneing, Bones gon' fuck your ho
Switchblade shines like ice and snow
You know me, I don't know you
You want me, I don't want you
Drugs in my veins, and I feel like I'ma die soon
Heart beating fast, wind blowing like a typhoon
Blood on my shoes, thinking about you
Looking in the mirror and I don't see you
Now, tell me where you at, I said tell me where you go
Cause I'm feeling all alone and I really need you to come home
I just really need you to come back home
Really need you, I just really need you to come back home just to...
Riding, sliding, smoking dope
If you want it, let me know
Zoneing, Bones gon' fuck your ho
Switchblade shines like ice and snow
You know me, I don't know you
You want me, I don't want you
Drugs in my veins, and I feel like I'ma die soon
