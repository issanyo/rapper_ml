[Intro: Bones & Gangsta Pat]
Bones
SESH
What?
Hanging with homies, that's up to no good
People don't like it when we come around
Some people say we do this and do that
But they straight just as long as they don't put us down
Hanging with homies, that's up to no good
People don't like it when we come around
Some people say we do this and do that
But they straight just as long as they don't put us down (what?)
Hanging with homies, that's up to no good
People don't like it when we come around
Some people say we do this and do that
But they straight just as long as they don't put us down
Hanging with homies, that's up to no good
People don't like it when we come around
Some people say we do this and do that
But they straight (SESH) just as long as they don't put us down

[Verse 1: Bones]
I pop in your dreams and I disappear (disappear)
Something wake you out your sleep but there's nothing there (nothing there)
Something creeping through the dark but no I ain't there
I'm in the streets with my blade so no, I ainâ€™t scared
In front your house just a ghost bedsheets over my fucking face (ah)
Smoke pouring out my mouth bodies dropping like the rain
Cold sheets, cold night
You clutching the gun tight
Every creek in the floor you loading that clip right
Busting that door cause you heard a knock
There's nothing on the porch and there's nobody shot
You can't kill if it's already dead
My birth was a death (ah) try (ah) to catch me if you can

[Hook: Gangsta Pat & Nightmare Na$ty]
Hanging with homies, that's up to no good
People don't like it when we come around
Some people say we do this and do that
But they straight just as long as they don't put us down
Hanging with homies, that's up to no good
People don't like it when we come around
Some people say we do this and do that
But they straight just as long as they don't put us down
Hanging with homies, that's up to no good
People don't like it when we come around
Some people say we do this and do that
But they straight just as long as they don't put us down
Hanging with homies, that's up to no good (what?)
People don't like (what?) it when we come around (what?)
Some people say we do this and do that (what?)
But they straight (what?) just as long as they don't put us down (what?)

[Verse 2: Nightmare Na$ty & Bones]
Upside down crosses randomly appear on your door
Waking up in cold sweats when you hear a creek in the floor
Your stomach gets weak can't fall asleep
The man in the street light has been there all week
Statues around your house randomly start bleeding
Phone rings pick it up and all you (ah) hear is breathing (ah, ah)
Every single night you'd lock up the windows
Cold chills up your spine every time the wind blows
As the window opens the drape start blowing
The rain keeps pouring you can't help but to start to knowing
The man with the mask (mask) who has no face (face)
Hutch you in your place where blood dripping from dragon bates
