I hate everything, I hate everyone
I need to be alone, I don't need anyone
Tell me what to say, tell me what to say
When I'm in your way, when I'm in your way
You don't gotta throw me down, there's another way
But you did, I guess we'll try again another day
Leave a permanent frown on your mothers face
Your life's nice 'til you don't wanna be nice to me
I don't understand at all
Maybe I never will
