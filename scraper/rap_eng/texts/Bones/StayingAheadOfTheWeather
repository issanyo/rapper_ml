[Verse]
Shit never is as bad as it seems
Fuck a lifespan, this is just one long dream
So try not to disturb me
Not trying to be rude with you, just hope that you heard me
Now the world keep turning
Since my mind was created, I been somewhat a hermit
But, every day, I am learning
Every bridge is different, be careful which ones you burning (ayo)
Cliche sayings are here for a reason
Like the ones you see showing are the ones you see leaving
It's all about the balance of moods
When I'm in my own way, I try my best to move
Don't let my past mind choose
And don't let the present control me and the things I do
The future always been my filter for vision
Stay focused on my shit and have the purest intentions
(Yeah, ooh)
Only ever had one idea
I never claimed to be shit or a fucking pioneer
All I've ever known was this
Nothing special, nothing rare just a gift for spitting, what?
Bones
