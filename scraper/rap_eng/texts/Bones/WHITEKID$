[Verse]
Motherfuck these white kids, I promise I ain't like them
I'm in the streets rapping, they locked in their room writing
I put this shit down from Howell all the way to Brighton
Got a Glock in my trunk and I'm picking it up and then striking your ass like lightning
I'm saying, don't fuck with me, I mean fuck with me, but don't fuck with me
I got a backpack that's full of cutlery and I'm cut throat
Now trust in me, like God
Now pray to me like Christ
I'm high as fucking shit and I'm white so I guess it's only fucking right
That I do it how it's never ever been fucking done
I blow caution to the breeze like that smoke that's in my lungs
Really rapping, really living all that shit I fucking rap about
30 blunts, 50 minutes that's what the fuck I'm talking about
44's stay poking out
Might slide down to open out
Blow potent out
Windows down
Eyes up and down
That coast now
I'm ghost now, I'm dead
I'm not white, I'm not black
I'm not sick, I'm not dope, I'm not coke, I'm not crack
Bitch I'm Th@, Kid

[Hook: DJ Paul]
You ain't mad is ya?
You ain't mad is ya, bitch?
You ain't mad is ya?
You ain't mad is ya?
You ain't mad-
You ain't mad is ya
You ain't mad is ya, bitch?
You ain't mad is ya?
You ain't mad is ya?
You ain't mad-
You ain't mad is ya
You ain't mad is ya, bitch?
You ain't mad is ya?
You ain't mad is ya?
You ain't mad-
You ain't mad is ya?
You ain't mad is ya, bitch?
You ain't mad is ya?
You ain't mad is ya
You ain't mad-
