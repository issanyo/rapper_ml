[Verse 1]

Raps Andy Kaufman
Pullin' up 'raris
So fresh 'till death I should pull up in a coffin
Blunt got me coughin' that's how you know it's awesome
Weed from California but my motor so foreign
Yellow testarossa we came with a few horses
Motorola beeping wish these bitches would stop callin'
Lookin' at my chain mouthes wide like they yawnin'
Screamin' TeamSesh and we ain't even fuckin' tourin'
Motherfuck your Nikes
Motherfuck your Jordans
Motherfuck your Gucci all that shit is just corny
But bitch it's all gravy
I'm not tryna change your expectations like a baby all I'm tryna do is raise 'em
Born in the bays so I'm cool with the raiders
Mixtapelegend more cuts than a razor
Subwoof bangin'
CD slangin'
Cash money records I ain't shinin' bitch I'm blangin'
Bitch I'm famous
Bitch I'm stainless
Not a scratch on me I'm the motherfuckin' cleanest like I'm fresh up out the cleaners
Flow be the meanest
Pants saggin' when I rap so I walk with a demeanor
Yeah
