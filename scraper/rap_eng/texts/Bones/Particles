[Verse: Bones]
Float above your head in a million tiny pieces
Cannot book me, cannot look at me until I truly need it
Then I'm leaving out the shadows after travel to do the shit we do
Road is long and full of songs to scream until we make it through
Smokin' shit with all my dudes
Slumped inside the bus we move
State to state, the ruined stages
Break it down and then we do
Blood up in the microphone
Speakers gettin' fuckin' blown
Ain't a fuckin' thing when you know that this is all you know
I don't have no backup plan or extra ways that I can get it,
This my plot and I will stand my guard and bomb whoever step it
Willin' leave you chillin' in the nature with the moss and shit,
Talking to the rotten man
You looking right I'll drop ya, bitch,
Down on the rocks and shit
Stones to your spinal cord,
Copying and mocking shit until you get it right to your
Doorstep when I floor step, that's imported
Stone settings change I stay the same
A different scene, same road

[Hook]
The windiest days
The coldest night
I will stand here till I have frostbite
I will stand here till I have frostbite

[Outro]
And we gon' let em drag for the 2016, for the 2016,
We gon' let em drag for the 2016
Bitch I'm Ricky who the fuck are you
