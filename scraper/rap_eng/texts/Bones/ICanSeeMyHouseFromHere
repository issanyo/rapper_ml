[Verse]
And every time it breaks down
I hope you feel it too
With every time that I scream
Comes an expression of me for you
I am not leaving this place, I am locked inside
Fuck out my personal space, I am not alright

[Hook]
Break it down, let me see you break it down! (Break it down)
Break it down, let me see you break it down! (Break it down)
Break it down, let me see you break it down! (Break it down)
Break it down, let me see you break it down!

[Outro]
Even the way you touch my skin, it lets me know
All I wanna do is watch you live, that's all I know
Even the way you touch my skin, it lets me know
All I wanna do is watch you live, that's all I know
