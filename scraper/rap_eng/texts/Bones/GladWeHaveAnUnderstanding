[Verse 1]
Fuck out the way, yeah
All your shit lame, yeah
I feel no pain, we're not the same, we in this thing
Scrapyard boy, backyard noise
Mold in my veins, can't breathe
Fuck this world, wasn't meant for me
Or the other way around, either way
We got what they need to get this bitch movin'
You see and repeat but still you can't do it
That's just reality checkin' back
Go back online and go flex them racks
The people you swear that would have your back
They the first one to go ghost when it black

[Break]
I hope you get all this money
And realize that this shit is nothing but trouble
I hope that I figure out all this shit with time

[Verse 2]
Here we go again sitting in the alleyway bitch I'm on a roll again
Glass in the street bums sleeping on the curb
100 so-called good people pass without a word
And they say wanna change it
You don't wanna change 'less it's something that you pay with
Say there's a price but you yet to ever pay shit
People talk victim but don't ever wanna save shit

[Break]
You, you got what it takes but you'll never do shit
You, you see and repeat and still you can't do it

[Outro]
Sesh
