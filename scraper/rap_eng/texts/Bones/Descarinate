[Verse: Bones]
Pussy wanna talk till I show up in the dark
No I never gave a fuck whats good (good)
Reason that they rot cause I'm embedded from the top it's the witch from the mother fucking woods (woods)
Creep while they sleep, no life for the weak
Enough dope for the month i'm good
Everything is corny that you touching ever touching
I dont want you then dont follow me
Cause that becomes a lie
Fall asleep in a box with the sword on the top
Put the grass on that, pat it down real tough
I'm done its enough, I'm done when I want
Lemme sleep for forever let me smoke till its done
First we set it up, then set it off (set it off)
If it ain't the team I turn it off (turn it off)
