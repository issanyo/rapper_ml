[Hook]
I got that Rolly on my wrist
I got that gold around my neck
I got that beep on my hip
I got that beem up on that tec
And it go
Bang
Bang
Bang
I gotta
Chain
To blame
To blame
Bitch I gotta
Rain
Rain
Rain
That do the
That do the motherfucking same

[VERSE]
In my drop-top Cadillac bumping down your street
Knocking pictures off the wall, letting my fucking speakers be
Keep it pipping
Never tripping
Never Slipping
Grain ripping
Bitch I'm different, water sipping
In the alley behind your building
Where I'm spitting my spittings kill them no matter what I say the shit I spit and the flows I kick turn grey skies to sunny days
Past the sunny caves
Riding in bucket seat
Turn the bass up and feel like no one can fuck with me

[Hook]
I got that Rolly on my wrist
I got that gold around my neck
I got that beeper on my hip
I got that beem up on that tec
And it go
Bang
Bang
Bang
I gotta
Chain
To blame
To blame
Bitch I gotta
Rain
Rain
Rain
That do the
That do the motherfucking same
