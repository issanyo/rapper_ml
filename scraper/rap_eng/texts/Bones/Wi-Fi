[Verse 1: Bones]
It's the wi-fi pimp, modems hangin' from my wrists
Passwords on my blunts, got to log in to get it (You've got mail)
Digits etched on my grave, can't decipher my slang
Wingdings when I speak, bold fonts when I sing
Bitch, I'm comin' through italicized, that's leanin' back
Backseat, chargin' up my MacBook up on my lap
Bitch, my signal always strong and my bandwidth smooth
Rollin' coffins and coughin' until I roll a new
Flash drive blade, plug it in your veins
Downloadin' lives, then I right-click save
Got a 101 CD-changer, Ikea couch with the Sharper Image razor
101 CD-changer, Ikea couch with the Sharper Image razor

[Outro: Bones & Snoop Dogg]
Loadin', loadin', bitch, I'm loadin'
But that's the life of a G, I guess
Loadin', loadin', bitch, I'm loadin'
But that's the life of a G, I guess
But that's the life of a G, I guess
(You've got mail)
But that's the life of a G, I guess
But that's the life of a G, I guess
(You've got mail)
But that's the life of a G, I guess
