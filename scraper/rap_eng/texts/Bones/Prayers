[Intro]
There they go right there
Turn off the lights
Hit the lights, nigga

[Verse 1: RVMIRXZ]
Right, right, right
There's a god in you
Bitch, robbing and killing in mind
Fuck with a god and then leave your heart stop
Penetrate five seven hollow tip so cold
9 millimeter with extensions, hoe
Back in the game and I came within
A body full of hate and a mind full of sin
Back in the dodging, we killing the cops
Headlights on dim and we rocking your block
Now ride, bitch (Now ride, bitch)
A nigga like me don't talk with the pigs
Ride with a few that be down with the shit
My finesses screaming, "Fuck your clique"
Fuck with a G O D S
Talk that shit, then we come for you neck
I born to the light let me take you to rest
Infrared beam, take a nigga last breath, uh
Dont fuck with a man
I dont give a fuck so I ride with a strap
Windows on tint on the black Cadillac
Pulling out quick, give a nigga heart attack, uh
Something like Raven
Bringing the thunder but this is my haven
Fucking with me you and you [?]
Making my money, she's rocking the paper
Right (Right)
Bumping the shit and I creep through the night
Burning your mind now you get in a fight
I'm riding with niggas that's killing on sight
Push (Push)
Open your eyes and realize
I'm a real motherfucker, I will never die
Just bow your head and just pray to God

[Skit: "Menace To Society" Car Jacking Scene]

[Verse 2: BONES]
I got Rockefeller dreams, I got Carnegie chats
I can handle belt money, I get commodore respect
Bitch it's 1859, hundred bitches on my line
If she ainâ€™t, rolling woods, she can die up on the vine
All black razor blade when I'm creeping through the night
Everybody know it's BONES when they see my fucking knife
On a spot when it's dark, bitch, I'm running from the light
Never talk, never walk, I've been dead all my life
I've been smoking all day, flicking ash all night
If I see you keeping quiet, bitch, just know its on sight
What what
