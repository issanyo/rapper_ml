[Verse]
If you don't want a problem then bitch stop talking
Cuz I'll slide up like a LG Chocolate
Last thing you need is to hear me knocking
Rather just stalk then I'm outside watching
Please be safe when you walking home late
Dunno what mood ima hold that day
Dunno what things  my brain gonna say
Tell me do these things and I say okay
Boy It's just us
Fresher then blood
Veins over flowing with chemical crumbs
Young and we dumb shit we do it for fun
While I'm getting the feeling you do it for none
Love to get bucks, chasing the almighty dollar you run
Hurting, I see you, I really do feel for you
But you have just done what can't be undone
Boy when you gone

[Outro]
Oh, okay I be doing the same shit
Oh, okay I be doing the same shit
Oh, okay I be doing the same shit
Oh, okay I be doing the same
