You fuck with them, you be with who?
I don't fuck with that so I can't fuck with you
You fuck with them, you be with who?
I don't fuck with that so I can't fuck with you

[Verse: Bones]
Say you go hard but no, bitch, I don't think so
Droppin' like plinko, broken casinos
Drop off the money but she won't know me tho, bitch I don't need no
Dirty Garcias fuck what you're here for no we don't need no-
Body especially someone like you who be fuckin' up fuck out of here thug
Make our own moves, make our own decisions
No contracts something you can't say, bitch
Rich and taking styles of the young and the broke down
I don't want your millions they'll be gone when you ghost now
See the road ahead, hoe, go on let's go now
Put your head down, shut your eyes and hold them
Posted up, posted up still legendary
Graveyard god still dopin' in a cemetery

You fuck with them, you be with who?

No I can't fuck with you, with you, with you
