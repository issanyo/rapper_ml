[Verse]

Tides hit the curb tryin' not to spill my drink
Ridin' shotgun bumpin' sesh up the [?]
Paint like a sink
Wet like a leak
Flowin' like a creek
Dirty but my blunt clean
Slidin' like kids
Ridin' on rims
Tint like my lungs pitch black so you can't see in
I'm who they wanna sound like with who they wanna be with
Never catch me speedin' hoppin' out of lamborghinis
I like to keep it simple
Woods full of indo
Ridin' to the tempo
Lookin' for the info

[Hook]

What do I do
What do I do
Ridin' through the night and I don't see you
Baby I know
Baby I know
And I need to come down just stop and reload
What do I do
Where do I go
Slangin' through the city while i'm blowin' my smoke
What do I do
What do I know
Slangin' through the six sit back and reload
