[Verse: Bones]
All I need is wood so I can turn it to some smoke, bitch
All I need's a half so I can turn it to a O, bitch
Never had a friend so I'm used to being alone
Find me somewhere in between Howard Hughes and Nina Simone
What, Lilac wine with the fresh french roll
Subtitles off cause one day we might move
1887 when the Model T move
Through the cobblestone streets where I let my mind brew
Remember when we used to bring coins to the teller
Remember when we used to steal bottles from the cellar
I’m blitzing with some brother had the ice white camo with the twin 38's because we didn’t know better

[Hook: Bones]
I know what you're thinking, I'm thinking it too, shit
Smoke with my brothers, we ride on that crew shit
We pull up the people like who this?
Who this, who that, who that now, when I pull up in it they don't know how to act now
Who this, who that, who that now, when I pull up in it they don't know how to act now
I'm going hard, I'm going hard
