[Verse: Bones]
Nothing else to do
Locked up in my room with some thoughts of you
Nothing else to lose
Shut my eyes, slit my wrists, take my life for you

[Pre-Hook: Bones]
I'm dying for your love
I'm waiting for your call
I'm waiting by my phone
I hope you call me soon

[Hook: Bones]
Bring me to life
Make it all okay
You're the only one that can
Bring me to life
Throw it all away
Bury me, just bury me tonight

[Pre-Hook: Bones]
I'm dying for your love
I'm waiting for your call
I'm waiting by my phone
I hope you call me soon

[Hook: Bones]
Bring me to life
Make it all okay
You're the only one that can
Bring me to life
Throw it all away
Bury me, just bury me tonight
