[Verse 1: Bones]
I'm unapprochable, I don't think you need me
Hold the phone, I don't think you hear me
Smoking dope, no, I can't see you
I don't know how I can feel you
Oh, oh, break it down for you
Oh, oh, I'm never 'round for you
Oh, oh, bitch, I'm higher
Oh, oh, I'm never high enough

[Verse 2: Chris Travis]
Bitch I'm pulling up, I'm getting high as fuck
Weed in the water, bitch, that ain't enough
