Part 1

[Verse]
The mainstream out of kings so they look to us
Papers in their face, I tell em' we ain't in no rush
Yet to try, so I mean it bitch, you ain't seen much
I ain't where they sell shit, I'm where they cook it up, damn
Ridin' in the eight-passenger van, whole team un-employed, but get paid in advanced
You bend your back working hard for a gram, bitch I make three O's before I break this O in half
Bet I come through with my team and make it smoke like it don't work
Bitch you see me, want to follow like I'll lead you to the work
But I'll leave you in the earth, 517 'till it hurt
Don't go nowhere unfamiliar unless you like the feel of dirt

[Hook]
Wanna buy what we made but we ain't sellin'
I can see it in yo face, you ain't no felon
Wanna buy what we made but we ain't sellin'
I can see it in yo face, you ain't no felon

Part 2

[Intro]
We got money now
Chains bangin' around my neck, cus we got money now
Chains bangin' around my neck, cus we got money now
Chains bangin' around my-
Chains bangin' around my neck, cus we got money now
Chains bangin' around my neck, cus we got money now
Chains bangin' around my neck, cus we got money now

[Verse]
Pulled up blowin' dope under the freeway
Team wild, they don't know how to behave
Say the word and we at where he stay
Play predator fake and be the prey
Phone buzzin, re-up, been three days
Free shippin' on my dope like eBay
Too many blunts, sesh looking like a replay
The reason that these pussy boys glitch, freeze frame
I don't expect respect, so when you see SESH, just protect 'ya neck
I really mean it, protect 'ya neck
Both hands on your throat, like you're begging for breath
Like you're begging for Brett
Brett Favre, Mr. uh, Favre I presume
