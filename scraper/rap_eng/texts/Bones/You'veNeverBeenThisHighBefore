[Chorus]
You've never been this high before
You've never been this high before

[Verse]
Rollin' blunts, blowin' hoes
Would they know than I'm getting so cold
Lookin down at the Earth below
Flow dynamite and it's about to blow
I can't believe just what I'm seen
From the sunrises to the evenings
Everyday is like a motion picture
Lights camera and it's fuckin action
Groovy fashion, weed assassin
Rag came direct just for askin
Always rappin, always hashin
Always pimpin, always mackin

[Chorus]
You've never been this high before
You've never been this high before
