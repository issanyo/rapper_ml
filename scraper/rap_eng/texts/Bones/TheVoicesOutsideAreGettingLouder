[Verse]
Carhartt mask, SESH on the bag
Smile on my face when your deal go bad
It's almost like you're putting on your own toe tag
No use in me talking, you already know that, facts
Disappear into the nether with a flash
No tellin' where or when I'll be back
But try to summon me, stand under the willow tree
Light a blunt, and raise it to the summer breeze
I'll be there, no question
Vest stuffed with all of my favorite weapons
The people on me the second I do step in
It's okay, I'll find another way to get in
Backdoor creep, I don't got no money on me
I don't got no diamonds in my teeth
I don't got nothin'
I don't got nothin'
Bitch

[Outro]
Back door creep, I don't got no money on me
I don't got no diamonds in my teeth
I don't got nothin'
I don't got shit (damn)
I don't need shit
