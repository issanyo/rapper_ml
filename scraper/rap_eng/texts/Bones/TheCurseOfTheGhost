[Verse 1]
Better l-l-l-listen, You sound l-l-like bitches
No, I don't br-bring no business, I just s-say what I'm thinking
While you straight flip for some digits, bitch I stay right here up in it
I'm at a sector you can't reach, 'less you been bor-born up in it
We-we be on the natives, talk they can't understand us
The dialect run much deeper than geography planet
Do not think that they get it, matter of fact I'm for certain
Show no respect for the planet, they look confused when it hurts you
Know I keep that 42 on me like my name's Jackie Robinson
Know I keep my composure real calm, but deep inside it's apocalypse
Any time, any day, you just gotta let me know
Any shade on the sundial, SESH ready to go
Any time, any day, you just gotta let me know
Any shade on the sundial, SESH ready to go
I'ma shut your eyes, I-I'ma send you off right
I'ma shut your eyes, I-I'ma send you off right
Looking in the mirror, and I can't see a thing
The curse of the ghost, I carry it 'til I lay
Throw some trash in my grave just to prove it's the same
Twisting in space, do you choose to complain
'Bout the littlest minuscule shit, you stuck on that middle school shit
Yappin' like a bitch until one day know you gotta get hit
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this, this, it's like that y'all

[Hook]
Put 'em up if you want, I ain't never gave a fuck
Put 'em up if you want, I ain't never gave a fuck
Put 'em up if you want, I ain't never gave a fuck
Put 'em up if you want, I ain't never gave a fuck
