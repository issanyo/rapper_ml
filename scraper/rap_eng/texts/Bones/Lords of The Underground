[Verse 1: GRANDMILLY]
Uh
Smokin' weed, sippin' lean
Aimin' an strap then collect that C.R.E.A.M
Triple 6 Devil just ain't my dreams
Pull out and pop it if ya'll outta pocket
Divine intervention my nigga, we smokin'
Swaggin' on stage and you know that I'm locin
Tripped up, burn it down
Cash on the endo, yo bitch lovin' me sex like an nympho
Uh
Making my rounds, passin on pussy if it is around
Weight of the world and theres [?] on my shoulders
Cop me a quarter, and grab me some rollup
Roll-up
Wireless like a xbox controller
If your nigga got deals on the yola
Tell em' hit my cellphone, I be over
Yeah
Drama consuming my set
Breaking these niggas off, can I catch reck
Tropical flowers inhale to my chest
Cropping these niggas up outta like spicks
Blast for me actually saying my name
Grandmilly and Raiders the clan in the gang
Cock it and hit you and watch your brain tag
Lords of The Underground bringin' the pain
Don't get caught up in the hype
Nigga round here you lose your life
Jackin' these niggas for their hoes
And getting real dirty with my sprites
Original man please understand
Me and Th@ Kid got the world in our hands
[?]

[Hook: Bones]
Never gon' stop, Never gon' flop
At yo bitch house and you bet she gon' pop
She twerkin', I'm rollin'
She lickin' I'm smokin'
She moanin', I'm going'
She comin' on top
Feed that bitch drugs, then I watch here overdose
Roll a blunt and finally fuck cause now we both ghosts
Both Ghosts. (Now we both ghosts.)
I roll a blunt we finally fuck cause now we both ghosts
Both Ghosts
Both Ghosts
I roll a blunt we finally fuck cause now we both ghosts

[Verse 2: Bones]
Steppin' out on the scene
Feelin' like its 93'
House shoes with a big blunt and a big clean white tee
Just popped me a bean
On the block with the feins
Making money my damn self, got profit all in my jeans
My skin tone look white, but at night time I'm black
I disappear like I'm reptile
Bitch I bring that com-bat
Never am I strapped
But best believe that these raiders are
Comin' down it's rainin' hard and I'm young rain the thunder god
