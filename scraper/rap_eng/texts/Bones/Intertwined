[Verse]
Every time I hear somebody think they fuckin' with me
I never sweat it I look up as they look up to me
I think it’s good you makin' shit but maybe soon you’ll notice
There’s already one Bones so ain’t no need for your shit
We all the same just algae in the lake now
Inside it’s real but I go out and it’s all fake now
What you say now? Can’t hear a thing now
We only stay around
Forever sesh remain, oh
Frayed edges ain’t a thing that will clear you
I’m off kilter, off balance but still, I make it clear
I don’t see money
Don’t see you
I see through all of you
Soon as you think I’m on to something know I’m off of it

[Hook]
I might be out of it
You, you're just outta shit
Out of ideas, but then again you never had em
I might be out of it
You, you're just outta shit
Out of ideas, but then again you never had em
