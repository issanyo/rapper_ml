[Hook]
I just bought me a Coupe Deville
Took out the air bag put in a wood wheel
I just bought me a Coupe Deville
Trippin’ on promethazine poppin’ the trunk
I just bought me a Coupe Deville
Took out the air bag put in a wood wheel
I just bought me a Coupe Deville
Trippin’ on promethazine poppin’ the trunk


[Verse]
Got a new wood wheel
Gripping on when I steer
Mahogany on the dash with some hundred spoke rims
Hit the mash and the dip
Big cigar to my lips
Middle finger out the whip yelling motherfucking bitch
Hit the bitch get the switch
Flip the trunk paint drip
Cold water let me sit just a young Slim Pimp
Ponytail in the back
Me I’m riding in the front
Two eyes to the sky one hand on the blunt
That’s 1-2-3 and to the 4
Riding around your city in that motherfucking low
The bass bang low
Trunk screaming no more
Glass break hear the sound think it’s fucking Stone Cold
I just bought me a coupe Deville
Took out the air bag put in the wood wheel
Spinners on the ride I could never stay still
Red light car stop
The rims still spin

[Hook]
I just bought me a Coupe Deville
Took out the air bag put in a wood wheel
I just bought me a Coupe Deville
Trippin’ on promethazine poppin’ the trunk
I just bought me a Coupe Deville
Took out the air bag put in a wood wheel
I just bought me a Coupe Deville
Trippin’ on promethazine poppin’ the trunk
