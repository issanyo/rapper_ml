[Verse]
I came here to fuck the game up, now they don't mention me
Petey Pablo when I raise up, now they invest in me
No one can tell your shadow apart from all these other clones
But when they see my silhouette you bet they know its Bones
Deadboy, back up on your head, drop the guillotine
Slanted ways I don't receive, I broadcast what I feel in me
Orson Welles, hope me well
Bout to scare the world and bail
Found the caves that lead to hell, tunnel down to til I was home
Walking on coals, Itching like I'm Tyrone
Know I'm fiending, know I need it, let me into another zone

[Hook]
What do I do with the rest of them?
I don't know, should they live or should they die?
Hold on I know whats best for them
Leave them out in the rain, one night with the team is all we need
What do I do with the rest of them?

[Post Hook]
Let me start by saying I don't like nobody
Let me start by saying I don't like nobody
I don't fuck with nobody, no I don't fuck with nobody
Let me start by saying I don't fuck with nobody

[Outro]
Bones, Bones, Bones
Bones, Bones, Bones
Wait, wait, wait
