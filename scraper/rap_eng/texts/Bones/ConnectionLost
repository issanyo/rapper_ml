[Verse: Bones]
Everybody say the same shit, ridin' with the same clique
Fuckin' with the same bitch, so I keep my distance
This is the difference to me and you, listen
The money come and go, but to me that never meant shit
Smokin' on the same blunts, bitch you're still the same punk
Put my parents through some shit, now I got to make it up
Wakin' up, rollin' up, backstage smokin' up
Crowds get to showin' up, now it's time to show 'em what
Bones really do, motherfuck your whole crew
Just some pussies online, act like rap is what you do
Never been no one to stop, dropped out, now what
Now I'm paid for some days, just for rappin' on the spot
What
