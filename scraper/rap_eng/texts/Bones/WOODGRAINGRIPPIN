Grippin' grain blowin' haze candy paints still drippin'
Fresh up out the shop hit the switch then get to flippin'
Im purple syrup sippin' got the key in the ignition
Time movin' slow reality i can barely grip it
See you prolly be slippin', but me i keep it pimpin'
Switchin' lanes, poppin' trunks, showin' out for all these bitches
Dashboard scotty Pippin, Woodgrain grippin'
Tape deck on blast, speakers in my truck kickin'
