[Verse 1]
You can see it, you can see it in my eyes, oh
You can see it, you can see it in my eyes (in my eyes)
You can see it, you can see it in my eyes, oh
You can see it, you can see it in my eyes
Roll up, hold up, sold out shows
Hold up, I don't know anymore
If I got a problem, you know who solve it
Either the blade or revolver
Load up six times, say your goodbyes

[Chorus]
Worst case scenario, I'll be gone
Worst case scenario, falling apart
Worst case scenario, I'll be gone
Worst case scenario

[Verse 2]
It's all my fault
I'm the result
Of caring much less
Than ever before
For what it's worth
I'm in a rut
To dwell on the impact I made on this world
Terrible, to the core I'm rotten
There I go once again with my problems
I don't wish this on my worst fuckin' enemies
I'm in disbelief anybody is befriending me
But they don't know, how bad it gets
They see me on good days, never on bad
Shine like baguettes, VVS neck
You can see my insecurities from a jet
Anyone with eyes can see my regrets
If you're down to listen I'mma get it off my chest
I don't think I got that much time
