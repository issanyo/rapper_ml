[Verse 1: Spooky Black]
Memories of you, they start to fade
Only see your shade when I'm in the rain
I want to be your voice, baby, once again
Want to see your face before the end
Always in the back of my mind
If you were here I'd still be alive
When will you realize
Just another teen suicide
Close my eyes, I'm going cold
Die young, never growing old
I'm losing my fucking hope
All these blunts and they're getting rolled

[Verse 2: Bones]
I'm waiting by the water
I'm floating on my back
I'm hoping that you're ok
All I need to know is that
You're ok when I'm miles away from you
All I dream about is seeing the face of you
The rain hits the window and it falls like night
Lying in my sheets with you, with me

[Outro]
Hey, I know we're all, like, iPod friendly and stuff
But do you guys have a plug for my Zune?
