[Verse]
Bandana wrapped around my neck like I'm B.G
No tint on the ride, let her see me
They on the decrease, I'm on the incline
Forsberg ice, you can stay with the inline
No punchlines, I ain't got the fuckin' time
Back at lunch time, rappin' in the fuckin' line
Young legend with the flow like "fuck your life"
Nice hood, but the alleyway nothin' nice
Hand-me-down rags wrapped around my bones
In the back of the limousine, talkin' on the phone
No money, no job, no car, no house
Probably somewhere in your neighborhood, rolling up an ounce
And we keep it movin', we zoomin'
My bass loud, so we boomin'
Cup full of ice cold water
I'm living life like a movie
Now thirty blunts, that's groovy
Hundred blunts, that's nothin'
Skinny pimp, that's Bones
Got a switchblade that'll cut ya

[Hook]
I'm ridin' round with my brothers
I'm ridin' round with my brothers
That skinny pimp named Bones
Got a switchblade and it'll cut ya
I'm ridin' round with my brothers
I'm ridin' round with my brothers
That skinny pimp named Bones
Got a switchblade and it'll cut ya
