[Verse 1]
Solar cell on the roof
Make the world work for you
I reside out the loop
Words are better when they true
Ash fall and hit the roots
Of the willow tie my boots
Watch the wind assist the bloom
Trees sing my favorite tune
Now the birds chirping too
Like chiming ins a rule
Kids rather play with tools
Nowadays they says it's cool
Feel safer with the heat drawn
Boy I'll turn your heat off, then be gone, what?

[Hook]
Everybody always stressing about the same shit
That when was that and who was there and what they say shit
But we know it donâ€™t mean a thing and we still do it anyway
There is no one else to blame but us
There is no one else to blame but us

[Post-Hook]
We could look around for somebody to blame and still it'd be the same
Lock the door today and stay inside and blame it on the rain

[Outro]
"And that was about the first time I made a good Screwball Martooni, as they call it"
