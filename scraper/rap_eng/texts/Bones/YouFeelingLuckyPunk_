[Intro]
SESH

[Hook]
Please don't press your luck bitch, you ain't one of us (one of us)
The second I do catch ya, it's too late to duck (too late to duck)
Please don't press your luck bitch, you ain't one of us (one of us)
Steppin' in my section, Bones be on the hunt (on the hunt)

[Verse 1]
Dipped the grave in diamonds for the fuck of it (what?)
Pain set in, I'm smilin', I have fun with it (yeah)
Soaking in total isolation, it's (ah)
The underground's dream, I am living it

[Pre-Hook]
Every label hate me 'cause Bones don't reply to offers (offers)
My archive of flows should be enough, go make some artists (go make some artists)
Make a hundred more, I'll truly stand not an ounce astounded
I can barely get past the fact that I came from Howell, now palm trees surround me

[Hook]
Please don't press your luck bitch, you ain't one of us (one of us)
The second I do catch ya, it's too late to duck (too late to duck)
Please don't press your luck bitch, you ain't one of us (one of us)
Steppin' in my section, Bones be on the hunt (on the hunt)
Please don't press your luck bitch, you ain't one of us
