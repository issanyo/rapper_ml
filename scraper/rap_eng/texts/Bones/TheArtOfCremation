[Verse]
Sitting in the motherfucking dark, just smoking
I don’t want to hear no talking, ey
I watch, even when they think I’m not
Wide awake, I hear you walking, ey
Sleepwalk if the dope don’t come
Never really gave a fuck if you don’t like
The way we do it from the movies to the music
I smile and I know that it's alright

Fuck is the word, touch me and burn
Don’t make me embarrass you
Was eager to learn, fuck waiting our turn
There is just no comparing us
Do it right every time
Without even fucking trying
It never gets fucking tiring
I change up the way they write

I’ve seen it once, I’ve seen it twice
I’ve seen it too many times
“We hope SESH blow up”
It do, now they look oh so surprised
“Now it's different”, quit the bitching
I don’t want your ass to listen
Pour a trendy four and drink it
'Till your heart no longer ticking

Tired of the motherfucking hold-up
I touch the world and it froze up
Promise I never care, promise I never will
Give a fuck 'bout if they know us
That never meant a thing
Fuck if you’re listening
We come and save the day
SESH and it never change

Need to go a little harder, boy, and I am your best reason
Bitch, I’m cremated, creeping, every season is SESH season
I’ve been in it for fourteen winters
You were beginning just last weekend
I don't force it still they weakened
Now our words are what they’re speaking

Shit a little different, I admit it
'Cause now I can buy some fucking dinner
Pussies bitching like its tradition
Bitch, I'd rather you don’t listen
I'll be honest that's a promise, I ain't no one to look up to
Rather you look down on me
Frown upon me and tell me that I’m not what you thought that I was

No, I don’t need no “Yo Bones you killing it”
Fuck up and listen that's not why I’m doing it
It's not a choice, I am the noise
Static bring havoc, I live in the void
We are just something you cannot explain
Radiate rays that you cannot ignore
I don’t go quiet, I’m slamming the door
El say to get it, I handle the chore

Never fit in I stuck out like a sore thumb
And I’m numb everywhere that we are
My blunt go out and the people they run
Cashed, and I’m apt to attack when it's done
Look in my eyes, I take you to the sun
Drop you off, burn you, then take you back home
You could be right, still, I'll never be wrong
You could be you, but you’ll never be, never be

[Outro]
Bones, Bones
Bitch, hell nah
Bones, Bones
Bitch, hell nah
You could be you, but you’ll never be, never be
You could be you, but you’ll never be, never be
