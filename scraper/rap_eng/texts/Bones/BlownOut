[Intro]
What
What
Bones
SESH
Blown out, blown out

[Hook]
Blown out, blown out, bitch I'm blowin' dope out
Blown out, blown out, bass shake the whole town
Blown out, blown out, bitch I'm blowin' dope out
Blown out, blown out, bitch I'm fuckin' smoked out

[Verse 1]
Swang in the lane with the blade on me, motherfucker now what's the problem
Backwoods rolled with the phone on hold, tell your girlfriend please stop callin'
Problem solver, no revolver, but I go bang like a 12 gauge shotty
Scales on my body, young reptile
Creep through the night I'm the chills in your spinal
Graveyard God, Tombstone Lord
Bitch I look like violence and sound like gore
Blood on my hands, regrets on the floor
Sleep in the waves wake up on the shores
