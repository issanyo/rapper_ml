[Verse]
Comin' through with that flow
Hoes know that that's Bones
I'm gone off in my zone
I'm zonin' off on my dope
See Jay rollin' up more
See El roll to that store
See me I'm up in that backseat and my feet out the window
They go ham when I go
They go wherever I show
They gon' do what I want
Get me high when I feel low
See Bones creep when it's night
They leanin' off of that sprite
I'm sippin' water I'm spittin' water I'm triple H with that knife hold on
Kickin' raps and you spittin' facts that's written trash knock 'em off the map
Off the shelf put 'em in a box last nail in the coffin
Drop, parking lot, dark or not, find me where the darkness stop
Steppin' up on the block with that switchblade in my fuckin' sock

[Outro]
I know that shit will never change no
Automatic guns hangin' out the window
