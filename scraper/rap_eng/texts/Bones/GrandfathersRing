[Verse: Bones]
Young and I’m handsome, looking like the Hansons
Mmm, bopping bitches, popping pills ‘til they dancing
I ain't romantic, I ain't lighting candles
Deathbound boy, bitch, I'm smoking on that cancer
Phone like me, dead so no answer
Razor in my reach, Bones hold it like a ransom
Walking work of art, so everybody glancing
Fine brush strokes, put the colors on the canvas
Smoking in the ocean, drinking on the shore
I feel like Bo Derek back in 1984
Step up to me wrong, get cut like a check
You bring your girl around, you gon' lose her like Beck
You got a little buzz, just know it won't last
You worried 'bout your image, me, I'm looking for the ash
You bringing up my past, it only make me laugh
See, I don't got shit to hide but go ahead and act
SESH 'til I rest, still I have my brother's back
Ain't nobody fucking with the team, that's a fact
My grandfather's ring, my father's old coat
I'm looking like both when I'm up here in my zone
You thinking that you're different, I hope you know you isn't
Nobody likes your album, me, I didn't even listen
I'm sticking to my pimping, my girl looking like Lizzie
McGuire, getting higher 'til the stars start to glisten

[Hook]
I don't know what you've been told
I just know you need to know
Nobody fucks with you
Ain't nobody fuck with you

[Outro: SESH Radio]
This is S-E-S-H Radio 94.6, this is Hugh Dunnaway bringing you the news report. And, we have a little traffic now update on the 96 highway. Little traffic coming your way eastbound, it’s gonna be about a hour or two wait if you’re trying to get into downtown unfortunately. And then all of you people trying to get into the beach on Highway 4, you have pretty smooth sailing right now if you leave, but in about ¾ hours I see the highways getting pretty congested. No accidents to report, pretty smooth sailing. So, if you have any reports or anything call us back at 324855586, thank you very much
