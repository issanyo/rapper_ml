[Verse]
Juice from the farmers market, dope from up the street
Non pasteurized drinking, smoking filthy, sipping clean
It's the scumbag boy crawling out the garbage sheet
Spastic mind, flip on that dime, I got problems you don't need
Exaggerated shoe soles, walking like a moon man
Haven't been to earth in some time you could assume hands
Full of new stones, 'bout to chisel out some tombs man
Worry-free, don't look to Bones with drama, I don't do that
I see them running off with the style that we made like 4 years ago
I'm glad you a fan and can finally feel so useful
Then they leave them starving, SESH give them whole spoons full
Airplane method like a child, runway ready for landing, oh
