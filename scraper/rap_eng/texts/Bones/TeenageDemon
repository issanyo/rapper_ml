[Verse 1: Bones]
Bitch we all stars in the dope show
Teenage demon, black clothes, and some gold ropes
You say you go, but you don't flow
They think they know, but they don't know
Flowing too heavy
Bout to overflow
I don't do drugs
I just over dose
Graveyard god
Marble head stone
[?] young white pimp gone too soon
I swear I'm too smooth (smooth)
All my life [?]
Gold cuff link [?]
With the alligator shoes
One, two, bones coming for you
Fresh off of three four blunts I'm up on your stoop
Knock knock open up, but they won't let me in
So I huff and I puff blow that motherfucker in
Posted outside of the inn makin ends fuckin meet
[?] I'll cut your ass up put an end to your [?]
Leave you down on your knees face down in the street
Snap back to reality
I'm gone with the breeze

[Outro: Bones]
All my life I've been better than all these rappers
Matter of fact I ain't rapping
Just a corpse inside a casket (bones)
All my life I've been way better than these rappers
Matter of fact I ain't a rapper just a corpse inside a casket (bones)
Don't wake me up
Bitch don't wake me up (nope)
Bones in the casket
Don't wake me up (nope)
Don't wake me
Bitch don't wake me up
Bones in the casket
Don't wake him up
