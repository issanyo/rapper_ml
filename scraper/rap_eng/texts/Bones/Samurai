[Verse 1: Xavier Wulf]
You stupid ass fools need to know this
I got a lot of weight on my shoulders
Step up in my way I run you over
It's over cause I'm colder
Folks wish harm to me on four leaf clovers
Damn man, that's atrocious
I try to keep some peace but shit disordered
Now I orbit and just absorb it
I see and read your lies like it's poetry
I speak the truth but some just ignore me
But it's all good, here comes the tortue
I'm king ice man but I will scorch you
You say you been trill but nigga know bitch
You just trendy, don't offend me
Niggas out in Texas madder than me
Cause you lames took trill and made it trendy

[Verse 2:Smug Mang]
[SMUG MUSIC]
Smug Mang
Smug God
Team Sesh
Hollow Squad
Smug [why you always got your]? [loadin sumtin]?
What kinda drugs you, be on
Can I be in your next song
I don't know who the fuck you are
Leave me alone, let me pop my bars
Fairly blowns I'll park my car
Getting high [wherever I'm goin']?
Living fast I can afford
From this lord till the country club
Smug Mang where you come from
And did you really roll one [road run?]
Park my car where how come
Stay fresh yeah man cause I don't know
The outcome
Hoes on my dick I love em
Only fuck with real bitches
Only ones that roll them, fat swishes
And the ones that sip codeine, but the one that I love
Happen to be somewhere green
Oh the irony, the irony
Ainâ€™t no motherfucker that higher than me
By myself don't bother me
Wulf and Bones they fuckin wit me and I fuck wit ch'all

[Verse 3: Bones]
Pimpin' never slippin'
Never gripping on the chrome
Bones got the blade, reach back and let it go
Reach back, then I swing, then I swing like children
Bitch I'm feelin like Xavier when I'm stepping in the building
I ain't shooting, I ain't banging, I ain't popping the Glock
Find me somewhere on the block, creeping when it gets dark
See I don't got no phone on me
Bitch know SESH be the army
I ain't loading up the tommy
But she ride like bonnie
I got drugs in my body
I got ankle rub beside me
The only thing that makes me different
Is I ain't afraid to die
I keep it quiet, keep it moving
And always steady smoking
Rolling up my Woods while I'm blowing out the coke
