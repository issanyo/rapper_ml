[Verse]
Drop everything and walk away from myself
I need some time alone
But you're everything, and everything is nothing else
So I don't need to go
You're always on my mind
I never want it to stop
I never want it to stop

[Bridge, x5]
You're a part of me

[Hook]
If I could go back in time
I only wish that I'd have got up and picked up the phone
Hear your voice for one last time
Then maybe now I wouldn't cry because I feel so lost

[Hook 2, x4]
I will never forget you

[Outro]
I can feel you
I can hear you
