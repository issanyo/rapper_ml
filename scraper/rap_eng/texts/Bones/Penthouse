[Intro]
Uh, what, what, what

[Hook]
Hoppin' out the car, lookin' like a rockstar
I'm in the cut, never find me where the cops are
I'm at the house, never out where the bops are
I ain't at the bar, I ain't where them shots are

[Verse 1]
I'm in the hills, with the birds, where them flocks are
I'm at the top, still ain't down where them rocks are
Fresh fruit, and salad on my dinner plate
Aqua with the ice, and the cash like Jake The Snake
I'm on a different plane, I'm in a different lane
Penthouse suites booked under a different name
They all look alike, they all sound the same
I'm no shirt, hair swangin' in the fuckin' rain
No chain, no gold, let it fade away
Took 'em to the pawn shop, swapped 'em for some fuckin' change
I gotta eat, team gotta eat too
Tell 'em put the house on, we leavin' with the fucking loot

[Hook]
Hoppin' out the car, lookin' like a rockstar
I'm in the cut, never find me where the cops are
I'm at the house, never out where the bops are
I ain't at the bar, I ain't where them shots are
