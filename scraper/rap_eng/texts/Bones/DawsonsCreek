[Hook: Bones]
Say you be up on the block when the things get hot
Let me tell you something that you don’t know (don’t know)
See I done seen the type, lose they life for the price
If it’s right then ya boys gonna go (gonna go)
Sitting in the spot, hundred blunts, make it hot
Get the dough when you crack a window (window)
Say you be up on the block when the things get hot
Let me tell you something that you don’t know (don’t know)

[Dylan Ross]
I was born from a nether void risen from the dusk
As I shed my skin I let the wind blow away my husk
When I look left
I see the future
Then you wake up
When I get out of bed and get dressed I stress at all
I keep the burden heavy
Not so heavy that I fall
But if I fall then you are there to pick me up and help me walk
At this point I can really do anything I want
But I cannot get caught if I’m seen moving mountains with my thoughts
Hate me all you want but you won’t get a reaction
I’m too busy
I’m too passionately about that action
I’m a king cast in my own crown down in the fire
Young Jake Jeckel with the frown in the fire
