[Chorus]
Running, and running, and running away...
Running, and running, and running away...
Running, and running, and running away...
Running, and running, and running away...
Running, and running, and running away...

[Verse]
If everything was just make believe
I would never have to worry about what you think
Never think about what you dream
because if I'm not inside them you have clipped my wings
If I fall it'll be thankfully
if I land on the world hope it don't break for me
Break me down
Are you happy now?
Feel good inside bout what you gave
It made me feel this way
Feel good inside bout what you gave
It made me run away

[Chorus]
Running, and running, and running away...
Running, and running, and running away...
Running, and running, and running away...
Running, and running, and running away...
Running, and running, and running away...
