[Verse: Chris Travis]
I wanna love you, cause I enjoy your presence
Forest fires in my dreams, burnin' trees is the essence
I can show you how to live, but I don't give life lessons
Floss your ring, chain and jewelry but that shit is domestic
I ain't trynna talk, nigga, 'less the money subjected
Bitch, seen me out, make her heart stop for a second
She can fuck with you, nigga, but she know I'm a blessin'
Everytime I walk the earth, I feel the ground shake steady
We can try to love eachother but that shit get deadly
Rather sit and make music while I smoke my medics
Won't ever go to jail cause they won't ever catch me
They can turn on every radar but they still won't detect me

[Hook: Bones]
I don't want to be here if you're not
Sittin' all alone, I just don't know what to do
I don't want to think about where you are
I just want you home sitting right here next to me
