[Intro]
I know

[Verse]
I never noticed, I turned the coldest on accident
I never noticed, I killed the game just practicing
Now let me know if, if you trynna’ smoke
I got drugs to roll and I got places to go
Hit the street just me and the moon in the sky
I don’t know why I don’t feel like I’m alive
Walking on pavement, slow, no racing
Fuck up out of my face trynna’ get up on our placement
You a pussy, you're afraid of your dreams
Everything you want, you don’t have what it takes
Only way you could is if you turned into me
But that will never happen so they’ll just stay dreams

[Hook]
Hear me in your sleep, feel me when you wake
Take me away to where nobody knows my name
Hear me in your sleep, feel me when you wake
Take me away to where nobody knows my name
