[Verse]
Creepin up out the grave
Ancient silk up on my fucking bones
Pullin up with that wave
Bitch its teamsesh till i fucking go
Steppin up on the stage
Speakers blowin from the microphone
Sparking a blunt to get in my zone
Close my eyes
Feel alone
Replenishing, recovering
Drugs got me hovering
Say ya girl getting bothersome
So I call her over just to bother me
Your girl say that you tiresome
Won't fucking drink
Or get high or nothing
I go home, she come over
Says she lost so I think
That ima find her something
I'm in the coupe Deville
Smoking by my fuckin self
My top is down my feet are up
I'm banging fucking sesh
Lean with it rock with it white tee
Sharp and the Glock stay cocked
On the block one shot in them
See I don't pull triggers
See I don't twist fingers
I stuff cigars full of drugs
And I'm drinking liquor
So I lean with it rock with it
Lean with it rock with it
