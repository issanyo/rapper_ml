[Verse]
I never mean to be a bother to you, I just want you close
Anytime I seem to argue with you, deep, deep down I know
That I am just happy I know you, and everything will be okay
I turn on flashing lights for you, there is nothing in our way

Everytime I look you in the eyes, I see what you're going through
I'll be here for life
Don't be scared, no need to go prepared
Because I will be right here until I fade away

[Hook]
There's far too many things that I hate on this planet
I cannot see the beauty of it if you're not in it
There's far too many things that I hate on this planet
I cannot see the beauty of it if you ain't in it

[Bridge]
I hold my breath and hope that the stars come out tonight
I've never been down this road, but you make things alright

[Hook 2]
Never stop thinking about you
Even though you're right next to me
Never stop thinking about you
Even though you're right next to me

[Outro]
No, don't say a word, I'm sorry
No, don't say a word, I'm sorry
No, don't say a word, I'm sorry
No, don't say a word, I'm sorry
