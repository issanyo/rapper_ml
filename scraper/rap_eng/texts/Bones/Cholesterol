[Hook]
Like this and it go like this
Let it go, let 'em know that it go like this
And it go like this, and it go like this
Let it go, let 'em know that I go like this

[Verse]
I’ve been waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
To open my eyes and see the world
I’ve been waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
I have been too patient I'm about to tell you the truth again
I have never seen
Not another one
Not another one like you
I have never seen
Not another one
Not another one like you
I lie awake and I think to myself
Do I really want to breathe
Then I see you and it all comes clear
You are the reason that I am here
I am here
I am here
