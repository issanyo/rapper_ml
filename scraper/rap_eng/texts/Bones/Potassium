[Verse]
We do not fuck with you
You walk in we walk out the room
The place where we do what we do
Penthouse we smoke out the room
If you in the way, better move
There's no point in trying to look
I do not mean to sound rude
Oh no wait, Maybe I do
Lookin the richest, I'm drivin'
You barely grip and you slidin'
Didn't you say you wanted to be poppin?
I don't even give a fuck if they like me now
Fuck what they saying I'm doing my thing right now

[Hook]
What was that you said?
I couldn't hear a thing I was just zoning off
Lay me to rest
Find me a place in the sun to smoke
What was that you said?
I couldn't hear a thing I was just zoning off
Lay me to rest
Find me a place in the sun to smoke

[Outro]
You Should Have Seen Your Face
