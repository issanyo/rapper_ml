[Verse]
Raindrops, raindrops
Commin down can't stop
Water drippin down my window
Trees shake when the wind blow
Too high I ain't lookin down
She say she too high, she never commin down
I'm just glad she came around
One milion blunts playin in the background
She say she higher that she ever been
I say that's cool, roll another one
My voice loud on the speakerbox
She tell me rewind, turn it up
My neighbour say "turn it down now
We try to sleep, it's 2AM
And we got to work tomorrow", work tomorrow
I don't give a fuck I don't work tomorrow

[Outro]
Makes me feel I belong to something [6x]

We aren't human [?]
