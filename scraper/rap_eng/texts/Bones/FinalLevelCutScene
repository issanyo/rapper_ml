[Intro]
Congratulations, you have reached the last level of journey to Sesh Island
Choose your character
You have chosen... Bones

[Verse]
Is it possible to lose if you've never noticed?
Can you see tomorrow if today is bullshit?
Things get fucked up every now and again
Living in a snow globe's lame as shit
People cutting off each other's heads for their beliefs
People dying in the streets so we just sit in our seats
Give our 2 cents about it then go on with our day
A sympathetic post about it, now you feel a-okay
Don't nobody wanna cry till it's them that's gotta die
I don't understand why, in the end we all fly
In the end we all go and gotta let the pistol blow
The second you take another life, the second you turn into a hoe
You a bitch and you know it, pussy, cry me a river
You have feelings that you couldn't carry on any further
Motherfucker, that's life, welcome to the fucking world
Pick a number, get in line

[Hook]
You ain't the only one, you ain't the only one going through it
You ain't the only one, you ain't the only one going through it
You ain't the only one, you ain't the only one going through it
You ain't the only one, everybody does it at different times

[Outro]
You have defeated the enemy, you have saved the day, thank you
Bones
