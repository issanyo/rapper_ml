[Verse 1: Bones]
Young Clay Aiken, ridin' with the razor
They hear my shit and can't believe that I'm Caucasian
Came from the basement, never lost patience
Long hair swingin' like I played for Iron Maiden
Drink while it's rainin', smoke while I'm bathin'
Motorola ringin' and my ring bling-blingin'
Switchblade shinin', shotgun ridin'
White skin pimpin' like a young Rob Schneider
Bitch, I'm zonin', bitch, I'm dyin'
Smokin' in my grave only time I get silence
Bitch, I'm zonin', bitch, I'm dyin'
Smokin' in my grave only time I get si-lence

[Outro: Bones]
I ain't afraid to die
