[Verse]
Hood up, blade out, bitch, I'm ready
Pro club, type neck, bitch, I'm heavy
Dirty old shoes, but I get clean money
When you get money you don't care about nothing
Still I know that I don't mean nothing
It just feel nice putting food in my stomach
One million blunts, and I'm back to the curb
Young white trash, came back for the serve
Long hair, looking like a young white bitch
But you never see a bitch go like this
Roll my sticks, I'mma show my wrist
And roll of the diamonds, let it shine, let it glisten
White boys can't listen
Get too mad they don't sound like this
Watch out who you dissing
I don't say a word you just wind up missing

[Hook]
And it's just like that
When I speak, bitch, don't talk back
And it's just like that
When I speak, bitch, don't talk back
Said it's just like that
When I speak, bitch, don't talk back
Said it's just like that
When I speak, bitch, don't talk back
