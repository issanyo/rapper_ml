[Verse 1]
Realtree Camo with the Carhartt blade
Came from the place where the hatred was made
I'mma make you dark like it's late in the day
No matter what I think, you gonna hate what I say
Earnhardt blunts, smoking like we in a race
Friends turn cold like the blood in my veins
Thoughts in my mind, like the dirt in my graves
So I press my head to the wall, till it breaks

[Hook]
Take me back home, where the moon don't glow
Where the sun don't shine, where the kids don't grow
Uptown where the youth get drowned
In the rag full of ether cause the kids don't know
Suicide rate up high when the winter rolls in and the money still low
And when he feels that snow, he knows it's the only way to get out the cold

[Verse 2]
Get out the cold, get out the cold
Life's too tough, bitch, please let me know
I take your life and turn it to gold
Roll my dope and turn to a ghost
Who you really think going harder than me?
Bitch, I'm dead bitch, bitch, I'm dead
Bitch I don't even breathe!
Said who you really think going harder than me?
Bitch, I'm dead bitch, bitch, I'm dead
Bitch I don't even breathe!

[Verse 3]
(SESH)
Feelin' something like Rick Moranis
Blew up the kid, now he doin' damage
You oughta know like my nameâ€™s Alanis
Hate on me, take a seat, young Christopher Hansen
I don't sweat all day, just to lie in a mansion
I break blunts like glass when you get the banshee
R2, R2, L1, R2 up, down, left, right
Then I get to bangin'

[Hook]
Take me back home, where the moon don't glow
Where the sun don't shine, where the kids don't grow
Uptown where the youth get drowned
In the rag full of ether cause the kids don't know
Suicide rate up high when the winter rolls in and the money still low
And when he feels that snow, he knows it's the only way to get out the cold
