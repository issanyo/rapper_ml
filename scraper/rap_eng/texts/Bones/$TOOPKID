A kid like me, i'm always on my grind
24/7 bitch you know where to find
A kid like me, smokin' lot of pine
16 raps that's 32 to life
High without a flight, hype without a mic
Never lose focus, been rappin' like all my life
Used to ditch class, to rap in the hall
Beats off my phone, lyrics off my dome
Jewels on my neck, waist on my chrome
Chrome on my waist, make no difference if you wrong
Click-clack boom, catch yo ticket to yo tomb
Your favorite rapper gone, i'm still on the stoop, bitch
