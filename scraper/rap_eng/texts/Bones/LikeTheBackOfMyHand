[Verse]
I see you dreaming but the lights are dim
I could draw your face without you even there
I know your face like the back of my hand
But a little bit better

A crowded room will I make it through
When you make up familiar faces that are strangers too
People dying without water while you throw away bottles
Half drank like the crumble in the company's followers

They don't want to hear it but they gotta hear it from someone
And nobody's stepping up to the plate
So I gotta relay my message

And nobody's stepping up to the plate
So I gotta relay my message

[Hook] x2
So tell me what do you see
When you look into the glass on the wall
The reflective surface do you see it all
Clearly now
Clearly now
