[Verse]
Live my life as if I'm dying tonight
Do what I want until they turn off the lights
I know that you're waiting for me to say the words
But I don't think you deserve my time
I got some drugs in my veins and the blade in my hand
Everybody know my name, I don't gotta say a thing
Everyone tryna be me but I'm the only one that can
Everybody tryna go hard but I'm the only one that can

[Hook]
On the other side, I'll be waiting for you there
On the other side, I'll be waiting for you there
On the other side, I'll be waiting for you there
On the other side, I'll be waiting for you, waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you, waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you, waiting for you
