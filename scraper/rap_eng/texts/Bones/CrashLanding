[Intro: oldmansteve]
Xavier Wulf, Bones, we are all counting on you

[Verse 1: Xavier Wulf]
I hopped out the ship with the woods lit
You tryna' get a hit you can forget about it
Fall winter spring summer run it back
I'ma smoke it down until I'm through with that
I'm sitting candy coated collar see the color hue
As soon as I pull up she say I fuck with you
And right before I pull off she say what's up with you
Baby I'ma tell ya best as I can fucking do
I'ma switch a new shawty every blue moon
New moon same color as my new room
No L O V baby all I do is doom
Told her hop off my shit I'm finna face a few

[Hook: Xavier Wulf & Bones]
Hopped out the ship with the woods lit
Hit the ground now we running through the jungle with it
Hopped out the ship with the woods lit
I'm smoking seven different flavors in my wood bitch
Hopped out the ship with the woods lit
I pop a candy coated collar see the color switch
Hopped out the ship with the woods lit
And you can see it in my eyes I ain't passing it

[Break: oldmansteve]
Now, you boys aren't from around here, are you?
Walk with caution on these grounds

[Verse 2: Bones]
(What?)
HollowSESH legend that razor it be the weapon
Let it sleep in poison, one touch and you now infected
Rise from the wreckage and bring em the unexpected
Off the hook like Jimmy I break the record, no special
They tryna' scream like they metal
They tryna' flow like they rappin'
They doin' neither while we doin' anything we imagine
We became legends at a time when we was broke in the alley
Was smoking blunts of trash living in the garage back at Elliott's
(What?)

[Outro: oldmansteve, Xavier Wulf and Bones]
Thank you, Hollowish Warriors, you have saved our land
Uh, sure
It's HollowSESH. But no problem, my man
