[Verse 1]

Baby stay the night, with me forever and eternity
Won't you stay with me, it'll all just be ok
If you stay the night, we can do what you want
If you stay the night, we can do what you want
Baby stay the night with me forever and eternity
We could stay all night we can do whatever you like
(I'm telling you)
If you stay the night we can do what you want
If you stay the night we can do what you want
