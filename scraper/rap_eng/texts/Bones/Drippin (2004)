[Intro x4: Na$ty Matt]
Back then they didn't want me
Now I'm hot they all on me

[Hook x2: Na$ty Matt]
44's I'm tipping, wood grain I'm gripping
Catch me lane switching with the paint dripping
Turn your neck in your damn Nissan
Me and Bones we ain't tripping
I'm finger flipping and serve sippin like do or die
I'm hoe pimping, car stop rims keep spinning

[Verse 1: Na$ty Matt]
I'm feeling like Josie, all black I slow the creek
Leather hat cocked back, and all is gold on me
Hop up in that [?], get mad if she ain't nude
Young thug get real rude
That fucking nasty mattidude
Sesh camp posse, whole team glossy
Lavish like Liberace, [?] opens she cause me papi
Sink my teeth into the [?]
Ice all in my gold
Draw stuff with them rolls
Turn my soul real cold
Sex and candy [?], here with me
[?] Frames I can clearly see
Flipping these bitches, like a young Geoff Rowley
All black I'm Mr. Crowley creeping through your alleys

[Hook x2: Na$ty Matt]
44's I'm tipping, wood grain I'm gripping
Catch me lane switching with the paint dripping
Turn your neck in your damn Nissan
Me and bones we ain't tripping
I'm finger flipping and serve sippin like do or die
I'm hoe pimping, car stop rims keep spinning

[Verse 2: Bones]
Lookin' something like TLC
No scrubs on my fucking team
No Glock in my fucking jeans
But you still get dropped like autumn leaves
Still the same old me
Walking down the block with the blade on me
Go ahead and act like you ain't old me
Go ahead and take my sounds say you ain't old me
Put it all on me drop down told them they all gon' see
Now they all say Bones it's been a long time since you been home
Didn't do it all alone, been with my brother since young day one
Young day want some flippin and killin just like I can't do wrong

[Outro: Bones]
No you don't get no love
People hear your music and they turn it off on you
Riding on the passenger side of your best friends ride
Get you some money
