"I know."

[Hook]
I just need a little while to calm down
It's gon' be a while 'fore I come down
Tell you straight, I'm willing to run around
I don't like anything that I'm hearing now
I just need a little while to calm down
It's gon' be a while 'fore I come down
Tell you straight, I'm willing to run around
I don't like anything that I'm hearing now

[Instrumental break]

[Hook]
I just need a little while to calm down
It's gon' be a while 'fore I come down
Tell you straight, I'm willing to run around
I don't like anything that I'm hearing now
I just need a little while to calm down
It's gon' be a while 'fore I come down
Tell you straight, I'm willing to run around
I don't like anything that I'm hearing now

[Outro]
No I'm not listening, save your breath
No I'm not listening, save your breath
No I'm not listening, save your breath
No I'm not listening, save your breath
