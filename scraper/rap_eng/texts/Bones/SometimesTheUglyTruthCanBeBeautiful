[Verse 1]
Check it
In my room feeling ruined like Pompeii
Just trying to get my head on straight, through all the way
Thinking about the day, the last time I saw your face
I only wish I could've told you come with me on the plane
Makes me wanna murder, cry, and love all in one
Emotion, promise I will always be there for you son
Sometimes I just wanna switch roles and change gears
Like I wish that I was gone and you were right here
Emotion, mind overflowin'
I wish that I could turn it off but it keep going
I wish that I could hit the break, but I keep rolling
And if they talking down, prepare for the chosen one
You've just begun, I been
Doing this shit since Nick had the blimp
You too new to shit to be a threat
BONES sneeze on the track and knock you off the map
Like that

[Hook]
(You know I don't sleep much)
Midnight and it's hard to breathe
(You know I don't sleep much)
Can't remember the last time I dreamed
(You know I don't sleep much)
Midnight and it's hard to breathe
(You know I don't sleep much)

[Verse 2]
You wanna step? Better learn how to battle
Sucka MC's get slammed like gavels
When words do travel and cases unravel
Now you caught up with Five years in Federal
Security expose your insecurities
If I show you the realest me you will faint up on the scene, capisce
Off the leash I'm a freak, put on a beat and I eat
I throw me a new rapper that think he fucking with me
I destroy, here come the noise
Came to get down, bad boy like Detroit
Tell them I breathe the same since I been in it
Hit the ribbon before they even start
Bitch I'm finished
Check it

[Hook]
(You know I don't sleep much)
Midnight and it's hard to breath
(You know I don't sleep much)
Can't remember the last time I dreamed
(You know I don't sleep much)
Midnight and it's hard to breath
(You know I don't sleep much)
