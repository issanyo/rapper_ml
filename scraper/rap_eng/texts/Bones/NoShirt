[Verse 1]
No shirt, no shoes
It's just me and my girl up in the room
No lights, no tunes
Windows closed, we just doin' what we do
Motion pictures on the screen
Backwoods gettin' blown to the breeze
They know it's Bones when I'm steppin' on the scene
Blade in my jeans, blunt guts in my tee
Creepin' through the dark, if you need to find me
Young white punk from my head to my feet
My mama know I love her but I know just what she see
A little boy gettin' high, rappin' on beats
No diploma to my name, was barely sixteen
Dropped out, left home, now these bitches on me

[Hook]
No shirt, no shoes
It's just me and my girl up in the room
No lights, no tunes
Windows closed, we just doin' what we do
No shirt, no shoes
It's just me and my girl up in the room
No shirt, no shoes

[Verse 2]
Young Nick Lachey, grippin' on my blade
Trynna catch a fade, you know where to find me
Alleyway creep, motherfuck a week
I'm smokin' all year and I put that on me
They see just how I rap and they think I'm actin' black
But what the fuck that mean, bitch, I'm ridin' in the back
Still with my brothers, your bitch, she under covers
Tell her "Wake me up" when the Backwood burnin'
Earth stay turnin', blunt gets shorter
I just hope I'll live to show my father what I'm doin'
I just need to know if you trynna roll
Gotta let me know, any second I can go
If I die tonight, I just hope you know I love you
I just hope you know how I really feel about you
If I die tonight, I just hope you know I love you
I just hope you know how I really feel about you

[Hook x2]
No shirt, no shoes
It's just me and my girl up in the room
No lights, no tunes
Windows closed, we just doin' what we do

[Outro]
If I die tonight, I just hope you know I love you
I just hope you know how I really feel about you [x2]
