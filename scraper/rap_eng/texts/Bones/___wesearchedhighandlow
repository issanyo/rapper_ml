[Verse]
You’ve always known
Just what I like to do
You’re always there
When I need a second view
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need-
I thought about everything you said
Floating around inside my head
And I can’t sleep
I can’t breathe
I just want to wake up next to you
My whole life I’ve been waiting for you
Before I was Bones, I was waiting for you

[Outro]
