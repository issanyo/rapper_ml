[Verse]
Delete the memories, reap the benefits
Dope forever lit, sleep I never get
Dreams irrelevant when you start livin' 'em
Fuck the dividends, do it for different shit
Team on the scene, chemicals on my coat
Professor Bones show 'em who is the bomb
Construct a building just to watch it fall
If you hear a kek from the shadows, be gone
Warning, warning, SESH don't give those
Every time I creep, it's out the blue through the window
To the wall, to the blood, drip down and fall
All my deadboys crawl, oh I'll be there by tomorrow
You can bet on that I come out the black, I'm the great white bat
Take you home back to my cave, they haven't seen you in days
A bad addiction for shade, always away from the rays
You got no real shit to say, cut it out give it a break
Lay it down deep in a grave to never be heard from again
