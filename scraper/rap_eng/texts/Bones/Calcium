[Hook]
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know which way to go
Walking down the road
Lookin' at the streetlights
Wanna go home, but I don't feel right
Spend my days at the river, spend my nights in the forest
Wakin' up to birds screamin' like I've been here before
See the day I get my license Imma have somethin for ya
If you come here with the issue, know I got somethin' for you
I got that butterfly blade, I don't got no hundreds on me
I don't got a damn thing to lose, if you're not with me

[Verse]
Smoking dope in my Adidas suit
Drop it, I don't need a roof
Look you in the eyes like all I truly need is you
Bathe in the sea, then I'm back into the cave
Bitch, it's SESH a.k.a the reason that you ain't the greatest
What
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait (Sesh)
Bones
Sesh
Sesh
What

[Hook]
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know which way to go
Walking down the road
Lookin' at the streetlights
Wanna go home, but I don't feel right
Spend my days at the river, spend my nights in the forest
Wakin' up to birds screamin' like I've been here before
See the day I get my license Imma have somethin for ya
If you come here with the issue, know I got somethin' for you
I got that butterfly blade, I don't got no hundreds on me
I don't got a damn thing to lose, if you're not with me
