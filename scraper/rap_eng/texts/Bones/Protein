[Verse 1: Bones]
Doin' the shit that I do
Ridin' around with the crew
Bring up your name be like who?
We don't know shit that you do
Never had nothin' to prove
Why you all caught in the loop?
I'm smokin' with nothing to lose
Bitch I’m the truth all this is, is the proof

[Hook]
Makin' this money, countin' this paper
Lookin' so lovely, the fuck is a major?
Makin' this money, countin' this paper
Nobody touch me
I don't need nothing
Dope got me lazy
Woods got me lazy
I’m high for days

[Verse 2: Bones]
Doin' the shit that I do
Ridin' around with the crew
Bring up your name be like who?
We don't know shit that you do
Never had nothin' to prove
Why you all caught in the loop?
I'm smokin' with nothing to lose
Bitch I’m the truth all this is, is the proof

[Hook]
