[Verse]
First I climb about the sewer, then I roll in like Killua
While you work on being cooler, me and my boys pullin' maneuvers
Say your crew is full of shooters, you and your friends are fuckin' losers
Wanna be just like them rappers, bust some guns and pour them deuces
You home drinking chemicals, I'm smoking, pressing  juices
A young Max Gerson, all I'm taking in is nutrients
If I hear some words that I don't like, I'll find out who he is
Put the pieces all together, now we go and do this shit

[Hook]
I ain't kickin' through the front, I ain't runnin' through the back
You don't gotta worry where I am, cause bones' know where you at
I ain't kickin' through the front, I ain't runnin' through the back
You don't gotta worry where I am, cause bones' know where you at

[Outro]
I know where you at, I know where you be
I know where you at, I know where you sleep
I know where you at, I know where you be
I know where you sleep
