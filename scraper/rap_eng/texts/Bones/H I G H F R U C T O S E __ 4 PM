[Hook]
I'm sick, I'm dope, I'm speed, I'm coke
I'm crack; I be everything your parents said don't
I'm weed, I'm throwed, I'm cigarette smoke
I'm syrup, I'm full of that high fructose

[Verse 1]
I'm shrooms, I'm tripping, I said that you didn't
I'm on that shit that got your skin itchin'
The bass in your system, the dick in your sister
The neighborhood kid that ding dong ditch you
That Kid, puts the sick in the sickness
I'm kicking these raps till they show up on the Richter
Feel it in your city every time that I kick one
Run for the hills or your mother's gonna miss you
I am the realest. You? You are the fakest
She? She come with me but with you she just fake it
Bullshit just say I just don't got time
Skinny jeans, gold chain, with my nose to the grind

[Verse 2]
I'm young, I'm real, I'm cool, I'm trill
I'm potent, I'm holdin', I'm the first how it feel?
I'm the midnight chill, I'm the sunset shine
You're loose, I'm tight like your fuckin' first time
Like fucking your first time
Blood red eyes, inhale, exhale, smoke white like I
Fly for a white guy, too high for life
Half naked in the day, fully naked by night
Blow tree love life, go and smoke you some right
Ride to the shit like you do tonight
Rap tag team $E$H that's the sound I like
Light it, flick it; Rap kickin' night rat till I die

[Hook]
