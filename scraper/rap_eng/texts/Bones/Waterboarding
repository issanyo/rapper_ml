[Verse 1: BONES]
Trench coat hanging, pipe bomb banging
Teenage suicide, strapped with the razor
Blood full of anger, sight full of strangers
Coming with that danger, you droppin like an anchor
No fuckin trust, no fingers on my gloves
Back when I went to school, none of you bitches showed me love
Now the propane blowing, you trynna run
Trynna save face acting like you knew I was the one

[Hook]
Save it, Save it
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know
Save it, Save it
I just wanna go, I just wanna go
Save it, Save it
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know
Save it, Save it
I just wanna go, I just wanna go
