[Intro]
Defkon...

[Verse]
Me and my team, we getting this (SESH)
We get the point while you missing it (yes)
Twisting up my own blunt, sitting in the darkness
Howling your own shit, pussy you don't want this
Get the fuck outta here
Back then, I used to scrap all year
Now I do this, pass away in a pit
Resurrect on stage, it's a duel for the depths
Wait, it's a TeamSESH renegade back on the case
Wait, Bones 'bout to tell you what it is and what it ain't
I've been growing
Oh so slowly
Tired of bullshit the world keep telling me
I just wanna leave, but I know I can't
