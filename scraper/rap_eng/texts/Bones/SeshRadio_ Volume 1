Baby won't you run with me

Everything you want I need
Baby won't you run with me
Its easy as 1 2 3


[Song 2]
It wasn't my intention to mislead you

Why you hating on me
Im just trying to see
Why you hating on me
Im just trying to breathe
Let me be
Why you hating on me
Let it be

It wasn't my intention to mislead you

Why you hating on me
Im just trying to see
Why you hating on me
Im just trying to breathe
Let me be
Why you hating on me
Let it be

It wasn't my intention to mislead you


[Song 3]
We could talk it, We could talk it out
We could talk it, We could talk it out
I hear them talking but they ain't saying much
I'm just rolling up these blunts
I hear them talking but they ain't saying much
So I'm just rolling these blunts all night
So I'm just rolling up these blunts
