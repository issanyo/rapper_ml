[Verse]
This life is overrated, I have tried my best
Speak up now or let me lay here and rest
On the count of three, opposite of light is all I see
Words clearly written but I can not read
Cannot breathe, incapable of being anything but weak

[Refrain]
Bones cracking every time I stretch
My blood burns me as it does it's laps
Around this track of trash that is I
Pour gas on my brain, let it drip through my mind

[Refrain]
Bones cracking every time I stretch
My blood burns me as it does it's laps
Around this track of trash that is I
Pour gas on my brain, let it drip through my mind
