[Intro - Jay Dee or Phat Kat]

Take his ass straight to a hospital

[Verse 1]

Im screamin dolla dolla bill yo
Pistol in the air route my mama's back window
Drugs never say no, fucks never gave those
Cops on my payroll, i'm all about the bank row
Never does a day go by where i ain't flow
Mind like an eight ball, spit like 8 flows
You pop like faygo, I'm raw like quay loose
Stole the beat of me and watch me hit it like babe ruth, hit it like Jay dupe, blunts poppin' garbage bag
Young cardiac, catch a fuckin' heart attack
Now my heart attack, i am never leavin rap
Leave my blunt at home, baby i'll be right back
Yea it's like that, get high as nuts rollin' another then we light that

[Bridge - ?]

You think it's a game, you think it's a game

[Verse 2]

I'm feelin' like Jordan in the 93 playoffs
Hit the fuckin' jump shot then i fuckin' lay up
Do it for the team throwin' up the middle finger
Fuck you if you love us, love if you hate us
Too much makeup, pockets too caked up
Walk with the gangster lean i tell em drink up
Fresh up out the water just a young fuckin' sea punk
Blunts by the seashore couldn't give a c fuck
