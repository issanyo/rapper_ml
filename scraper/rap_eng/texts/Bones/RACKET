I'm feeling this shit
I'm killin' this shit
I'm 17 and I can't believe I'm killin' this shit
I put it down, for the Team that's SESH
[?], black heart in my chest
It's curtains, I'm goin' hard
I'm makin' racket
Don't give a fuck if you're not likin' how I'm actin'
You're not diggin' how I'm rappin'
I'll be joking, you're not laughin'
I'm Th@ Kid, quit school and really did this rap shit
Christmas, light on
Mic with the light on
Red light, record, Kid goes, beast mode
All my friends back home, just can't believe they rise
Is he still doing this rap shit? Not a surpise
Cause they know, that it's in me
And they know, this has been me
Since the first day in the basement
Kickin' rap shit till the sun drops
Nigh falls, night calls tanqueray and sprite up
Night in the garage [?]
Red smoke eye
The echo of everything I used to know
