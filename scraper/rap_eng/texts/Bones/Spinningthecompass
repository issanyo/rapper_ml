[Verse]
I cannot wait to see you
I cannot wait to find you
I've been traveling for some time
For some time
And I've yet
To see another face like yours
If we're all just living for nothing
Somehow you are my something
My heart doesn't beat
When presented the opportunity
My lungs don't work
My eyes don't see if you're not
Will I be frozen under the fear?
Sitting right in front of me
When presented the opportunity
Will I be frozen under the fear?
