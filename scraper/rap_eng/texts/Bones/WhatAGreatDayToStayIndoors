[Hook: Bones]
I don't get along with nobody, no
I think I need a planet of my own
I don't get along with nobody, no
I think I need a planet of my own

[Verse 1: Bones]
They stop all the bickering when I step in the picture
Like the scene only pretty when I give it permission
The flowers, they only grow if I decide to let them
Forever progressing never did listen to what they tell us
I built me an Echo Chamber so I can hear my anger
It's coming in loud and clear if I open there will be danger
I am cautious with every being, don't matter if you're a stranger
I wave in my own reflection, like how do you do my neighbor

[Hook: Bones]
I don't get along with nobody, no
I think I need a planet of my own
I don't get along with nobody, no
I think I need a planet of my own

[Bridge: Bones & Jon Simmons]
Ride slow, ride slow, ride slow, ride slow
Take the desolation, you can't be still calling on the phone
Our planet all (calling, calling)
I know if I run into the fog
I know if I run into the fog
Say you got cut off, say you got cut off

[Hook: Bones]
I don't get along with nobody, no
I think I need a planet of my own
I don't get along with nobody, no
I think I need a planet of my own
