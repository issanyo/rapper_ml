Uh, I need some closure now
My past is too loud
And there's no telling [?] to turn it down
[?] one got [?]
Feet to the ground, paper to the pen, made their finger to the air, all eyes on the kid
Usually, I'm used to bitches going cookoo
[?] now I'm ain't see how that shit was useful
Crown from the mixtapes, king of the new school
Laughing at the peasants playing loose like a loose tooth
Young man gotta get that tight
And if you want to rule the game you gotta play that right
If you want to be tomorrow, gotta be tonight
But for now, take a sit and watch the kid light mics

Look
Too many [?] saying I saved hip hop
But not enough screaming "I love hip hop"
You gotta feel the kid rock
You gotta hear the kid talk
Feeling new to the game, I ain't even gotta save yet
I know there's a save check from now too famous
Strobe lights, we in sports cars
Peering into dreams that [?] instead of yours, so
I'm doing what I got to do to get 'em
Until I'm [?] [?] [?] into your city
I'mm be the kid, and, you can be the petty telling them go get their shine box they so [?]
