[Verse]
I've been working on myself, I just hope it's not too late
I just hope that you can see a difference in me
If you're running short of air, if you need, I will be there
I will breathe into you
I've been working on myself, I just hope it's not too late
I just hope that you can see a difference in me
If you're running short of air, if you need, I will be there
I will breathe into you
