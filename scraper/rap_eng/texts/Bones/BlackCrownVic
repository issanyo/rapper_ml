[Verse 1: Bones]
Skinny white pimp, Black Crown vic
Hoes on my dick 'cuz I look like this
Gold on my neck, got gold on my wrist
Got a mac on my waist if you tryna get hit
We just riding 'round, riding 'round your side of town
Rollin' up these blunts, won't ever give a fuck
Any now, 'bout to start
You can suck my fucking dick, I've been doing what I want and I yet to regret shit
I'm with the team,with the team, fuck your life I'm with the team
Ain't nobody gonna tell me I do not deserve it
Sounding like the 90s and it feels like it too
I'm riding past the places that I used to take you
I got that bass in the trunk, rollin' a blunt
Ashing out the window, roll another one
Loving the fact that I'm dumb and I'm young
I got so much time to learn

[outro]
Bitches on me on me 'till the day 'till that I'm gone away gone and gone and gone away
