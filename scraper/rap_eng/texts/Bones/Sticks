[Verse]
We use to count
On the trashbag ounce
Sticks sticking out
Now we dont gotta do no pickin out
We just claw at the jar till we think we out
So tragic but that never happen
Dead end music you get no traffic
Only thing worse than to hear you rappin
Is to listen to the sound of a stale wood crackin
See the seshcrown and the peasants get dashin'
We make racket, they book it like Scholastic
Never met passion, you don't know action
Never heard of doin' shit just cause you have to
Never took steps, you know me, I'm glad to be
Never on stage, you forever in the rafters
I'ma show you ways you can do it, no askin'
Reachin' for favors that you never had to

[Hook]
I can show you things, there's a hundred million ways to be the one
But you gotta do it your own way
I can show you things, there's a hundred million ways to be the one
But you gotta do it your own way
