[Intro]
I have never ever felt this way before
I have never ever felt this way
So I can't tell you how it goes

[Verse]
I have never done it so I wouldn’t know
I never tried this hard before
I'm on the ground but I knew it well
I've always tried to get out of hell
When my heart beats loud, do you hear me?
When my heart stops beating, will you feel me?
Or will you fear me?
Or will you fear me?
It’s time to show you just how it feels

[Chorus]
Pull the sky down watch me pull it down
Pull the sky down watch me pull it down
Pull the sky down
Pull the sky down
Say goodbye to your life cause it's mine now
