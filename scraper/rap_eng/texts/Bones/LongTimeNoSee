[Verse 1]
Say you masked up like Hamilton, 32 in the palace
I'll rip ya, turn the place to Pacer / Piston type of racket
I'm laughing at your bracket, you gon' have to triple practice
For me to even hear you is like a deaf man hearin' traffic
Go and flick ya brights, go ahead and risk ya life
Fuck around, we gon' fuck around and shed some fuckin' light
On your whole situation, it's ok to be creative
Just don't try and paint a picture that's already been created
I been waiting, you been waiting, everybody been fuckin' waiting
But just 'cause everybody patient doesn’t mean we all will make it
I don't stop, I don't cease, I don't blink, I don't need
Me a motherfucking thing, on the other hand you just so weak
Never paid for a feature, never played to be in the bleachers
Only did my own shit, now I get paid to do the feature
Throw that right in my account, teller read me my amount
Never smile but every time I hear I swear it's sneaking out
You save for a rainy day, me? I save for everyday
If someone that I love needs something, we gon' get that shit today
Floor plans for the spot, funny how they acting now
Smiling in ya face based off assumptions, you gon' help 'em out
Swat away the flies, watch 'em fall out the sky
Geronimo, watch 'em go, they always look surprised
Same mouth speaking praise was the same one throwing shade
Fuck your name, fuck the non-existent lane you never made
I pass up the paper like it’s time to grade 'em
You probably jump at thinking you gon' make a nickel
I pass up the paper like it’s time to grade 'em
You probably jump at thinking you gon' make a nickel
I promise it’s my wish for them to act like
They never heard of me and see just who they rap like
'Cause if it ain't me
It’s just another page in the book that nobody reads
And that's truer than trees
Release a symphony, leaves singing during a breeze
I swear this shit is a breeze
I be so at ease while working the weed
And that's truer than trees
Release a symphony, leaves singing during a breeze
I swear this shit is a breeze
I be so at ease while working the weed
