[Verse]
Rolex diamonds, cadillac driving
Arm out the window, stunting while I'm sliding
Smoke while roll, roll when I choke
When I bust out a flow, sound like it's 94
And I feel like 96, blowing on that pine drowe
In the back of the 'lac, rolling to the condo, bitch
People going off, ninas going down
Pays your buzz, best believe you are get down
'Cause the guns up against you
And the bullets, they will hit you
Bitch, it ain't even an issue
It's a cold world, don't let it get you
If you try to slide, maybe we can ride
If you try to slide, maybe we can ride
