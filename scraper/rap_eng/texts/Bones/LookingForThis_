[Verse]
Eyelids permanently like I got the cold
Sprinkled in diamonds, filled with violence, shown around the globe
Rings lookin' like I'm climbin' out the fuckin' snow
Twinkle like powder, I could pawn off my weight in gold
And jewels, the rules, they might work for you
But not for me, I follow my lead, now it work for two
The waiter know my name, my skin can sense the fake
Don't come around with shit that'll dead you, please don't test your fate
Cause I am who you meet, when you no longer breathe
Your pain, it is my reach, now bleed and feed me, let me eat

[Outro]
Push me out to the blue, let me see what it do
If I sink then let it sink, die with the sky as my roof
Push me out to the blue, let me see what it do
If I sink then let it sink, die with the sky as my roof
Bones
