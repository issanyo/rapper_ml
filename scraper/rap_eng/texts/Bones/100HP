[Verse]

Key blade in my hands young star when I swing on destiny island
100HP and my XP full
Every level gettin' better, every day gotta flow
Pixelated pixels, a digital world
In my white noise whip with my digital girl
PS1 up in the dash dark tint up on the glass
Hydro pump in my cup, razor leaf when I ash
Bath house smoking, my white SESH robe
Toast to the team that's SESH 'till I go
You can have a clique, you can have yourself a team, but you'll never ever have a fuckin' army like me
Young sorcerer, red stones in my chain magic leakin' through the flow like a roof full of rain
Drip drop hip hop, fuck, whatever they callin' it
But this is SESH say you're right stop calling me
You stay following, me I'm only leading 'em
Album every month artwork just teasing 'em
Young legend every song be a blessing
You tryna to send a message, me I'm tryna to teach a lesson
You try too hard, me I'm goin' too hard
You say you workin' all day but only make two songs
It ain't work if you truly fuckin' love it
So I'm fuckin' when I'm flowin' beat comes and I'm bustin'

[Outro]

Every day is a dream
Every night be the same
I'm in my rocker on the stoop
Writing songs for y'all to sing
Every day is a dream
And every night be the same
Every day is a dream
Every night be the same
I'm in my rocker on the stoop
Writing songs for y'all to sing
