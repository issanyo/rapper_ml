[Verse 1: Bones]
I've been waiting and sitting and still
I pick up the ringing
It's getting loud, can you hear me?
It's stress me out, all the feeling I've ever had
I'm an invisible scar
We used to yell shotgun before we got in the car

[Refrain: Bones]
Sitting up by the creek again
Singing the same old song, singing the same old words
Sitting up by the creek again
Singing the same old song, singing the same old words

[Outro: Drip-133]
So many people spend so much of their life, energy, sweating the small  stuff, but the complete thing is the magic and beauty of life
