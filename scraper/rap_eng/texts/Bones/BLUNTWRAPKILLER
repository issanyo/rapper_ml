[Verse 1]

I don't really give a fuck ride with the system up
Put it down for my team tell your bitch to pick it up
Drugs in the trunk, run forest run tell 'em don't stop get it how he wants
Get it how you live, that's what they always say
Blunt wrap killin' killin' blunts all day
Bars in the chain but I'm bout to let 'em spray
Duck down click clack bang bang
Everyday I see myself, gettin' little older
My only motivation to kill it until it's over
It's all i fuckin' need, some beats and my team
Fresh fruit up on my plate double Y full of greens
Tin foil on my teeth catchin' rays at the beach
Bitch
Tin foil on my teeth catchin' rays at the beach
