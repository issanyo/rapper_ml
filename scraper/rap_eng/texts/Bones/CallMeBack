[Verse]
Rain coming down, let it hit my face
Dripping down just to roll down my waist
Hate what she love and love what she hate
Came from a place where nobody feel safe
Pills turn dust when the pipes get rust
Water heater working overtime just for us
Living in a tomb, no path for the doomed
Know my time's coming soon, just make sure I got my jewels
Bitches and gold covered in blood and mold
See you shining back then now you just so dull
Tombstone grass with the face of my past
Just another teen suicide added to the map
Painful to touch, fangs full of rust
150 blunts and I don't feel much
Fuck taking cuts, got cris in cups, [?] that I've cut

[Hook]
We light up like lighting bugs do, make it bright
Rolling the dope, no I cannot get higher
Say your team winning, I know that you're lying
We light up like lighting bugs do, make it bright
Rolling the dope, no I cannot get higher
Say your team winning, I know that you're lying

[Refrain]
Stop lying to yourself, stop lying to yourself
Stop, stop, stop
Stop lying to yourself, stop lying to yourself
Stop
Wait
Wait
Now
