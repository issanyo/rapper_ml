[Verse 1]
Before the sun rise I am
Already up and at 'em it’s the corpse with a plan
Manual labor I got the world in my hands
They see me out in public hit me with the audible glance
Two left legs, do not invite me to dance
'Cuz I will cut the rug up and go rob your advance
Y'all so typical with your obvious rants
Me I stay unorthodox that’s how I enhance
The life I'm livin' now wasn't possible then
Still I picked my little dreams up took 'em and ran
Small town too small for me to advance
Took 'em to the extreme I saw the limit and passed
Now I'm on the dash runnin' away from my past
From a place where nobody pitched in for the gas
No words of encouragement had to give ’em to myself
Talkin’ in the mirror like you'll have to do it yourself
When I did, cold shoulders got so frozen
MisterTenBelow drop ’em all in the ocean
Change my phone number so now they all holdin'
I knew they'd come around pussies always foldin'
Askin’ how I did it hit 'em with the "I don't know" shit
Everybody has their preconceived notions
'bout the dead man 'fore words are even spoken
Hopeless, don't involve me in your showbiz, bitch

[Verse 2]
Who do it better I'm fed up I got the medicine
For those seekin', asylum I'm bout to let you in
Dropped out at 15, what the fuck's a letterman?
Do not ask me shit about graduation day
I just do this shit that you see when dreams flashin'
At the international terminal checkin' bags in
Long flight to Moscow, wake me when we land
Shit, my lady, my brother, 14 hours and then we landin'
Spasibo to the real fans, just know you got me this far
I short circuit press to talk, just like a discord
I'm a flashdrive with a hundred billion terabytes
Never runnin' out of shit that's why they runnin' for their life
Lights out for any competition, though
Yet to see one, though, within my peripheral
Hold on, here we go, send 'em off, cheerio
Good day, chaps and now relax I am imperial
Feet up just like a king should
Who the fuck else done as much as I done?
"Lord Bones, do you ever take a break?"
Every day's a vacation, where you become the wave

[Outro]
What?
SESH, Bones
