[Intro]

[Hook: Bones]
I need you, and I hope you need me too
I see you, and I hope you see me too
I want you, and I hope you want me too
I want you, and I hope you want me too

[Verse 1: Bones]
Dead of the night, running from the light
Everything change when you find it's all a lie
Wake up in the middle of the night, want to die, but I know I'll be OK
Save me from the past that I can't seem to shake, you can make it all OK

[Verse 2: Bones]
Tell me that you'd die for me baby
Tell me that you'd die for me slowly
Feed that bitch pills, watch her pass away
Smoking in the dark then I'm ashing on her grave

[Outro]
