Yeah

[Verse1:Bones]
When we were young we'd always talk about gettin' outta town
Now I'm a little older and just look at me now
I got El
While they just remain slaves to gravity
I'm tryna' be the first star, from another galaxy
Astronomy, looking out the sun roof, pondering
The blunt gets passed to me flaming like Calgary
I gotta take the hit before it goes out
My lungs filled with smoke I blow a couple o's out
Over to my girl now, shot-gunning the dope
Call it X's and O's the way we tic-tac smoke
It's a cats game for you pussies when I ain't tryin
Cause it's meaner to get them thinking that they coulda' won it
But that ain't nothin', cause I am the bully of this hallway
The duke of the depths
The king of the rats
So I'm always, reppin'
If the cats start steppin'
Throw a night rats salute
To show them in the veteran
I don't give a fuck, it's apparent by my raps
Find me with the team, that's the SESH rap-pack
Back seats smoking
Seat flat back
Old fashion life, smoke white, lungs black
