[Verse 1: J.K the Reaper]
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yeah
Aquarium tabby
I got that potentest magic
Getting any bitch open
Imagine me in yo back
With no batteries
It suck and it sad to see
But it ain't my fault its happenin'
I don't fuck with those backwoods men
Got this pack words in packaging
Wrap her up and then send her out
After I hit it I'm out of bounds
I don't give a fuck about how I sound
Compared to me you're just silent
But I'm vibrant
Like the volume
Of them sirens
Of the pigs
That you be riding with
Yeah, fame life plus SESH subtractor bitch, go!

[Hook: Bones]
What?
Riding down the street (street)
Money in my socks
Blowin' O's to the breeze (yeah, yeah)
And she fucking with the team (team)
Feed that bitch drugs
Watch her drop to her knees

[Verse 2: Bones]
What?, what?, SESH, aye
Smoking on my dope (dope)
Talking on the phone (phones)
Bitches know its Bones (Bones)
When I kick the flow (flow)
Bitches know I'm grown (grown)
Never doing wrong (wrong)
Pimping in the parking lot
I'm sparking up a zone (zone)
Wishin I was on (on)
Wishing I could be alone (lone)
Wishing I could go away
For a time that's very long (long)
I ain't gripping on no chrome (chrome)
I ain't fucking all these hoes
Gotta a hall black blade if you really tryna know
Let me go

[Hook: Bones]
What?
Riding down the street (street)
Money in my socks
Blowin' O's to the breeze (yeah, yeah)
And she fucking with the team (team)
Feed that bitch drugs
Watch her drop to her knees

[Outro]
What? what? sesh
What?
