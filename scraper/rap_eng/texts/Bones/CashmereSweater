[Verse 1]
Cold breeze warm weather
Bucket hat with my cashmere sweater
Never acting like I'm better
Still bitches know young bones never let up
Twenty five lighters on the dresser, yes sir
Lately I ain't smoke still higher, than ever
Rose water in my tea sip it slow
As I think, close my eyes, just breathe, let it go
I'm just loving every second I'm alive
From the day I was born till the night that I die
You try hard but me, I don't try
You acting like you hard but we know you just a lie
I ain't trying to portray no image
Just a young white fuck no car still driven
Young dumb funny girl looking like pad
Hank hill whip gold wheel white caddy
Propane flowing up in my veins
Watch where you light the blunt
You don't want to see me bang, bang

[Outro]
You don't want to see me bang, bang (x3)
