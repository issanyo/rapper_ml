[Hook]
I wake up early in the mornin'
Put on my jewelry get right on it
I waste no time, I get to rollin'
All black, head down just like I'm mournin
Killed every city I perform in
I promise boy you can't afford me
Don't gotta price for these informants
I know my style ain't nothin' formal
I wake up early in the mornin'
Put on my jewelry get right on it
I waste no time, I get to rollin'
All black, head down just like I'm mournin
Killed every city I perform in
I promise boy you can't afford me
Don't gotta price for these informants
I know my style ain't nothin' formal
I wake up early in the mornin'
Put on my jewelry get right on it
I waste no time, I get to rollin'
All black, head down just like I'm mournin
Killed every city I perform in
I promise boy you can't afford me
Don't gotta price for these informants
I know my style ain't nothin' formal
