[Verse]
I’m cash bitch, salt water in my bath bitch
Candles lit, my dope rolled
I’m living life on that lavish shit
Rare stone cover the wall
Bamboo cover the floor
Body scrub made of diamonds
Shining while I clean my pores
Blade exfoliates, my brothers, they on the way
If you choose to fucking stay, you gonna’ be on First 48
My blood is full of drugs, you act like a fucking thug
We know you a fucking bitch, we know you a fucking scrub

[Hook]
Coming down clean, bitches know it’s me
Rolling up my weed, I don’t want to leave
Blade on me, I hope you’ll never try
I don’t want to be the reason that you die
Coming down clean, bitches know it’s me
Rolling up my weed, I don’t want to leave
Blade on me, I hope you’ll never try
I don’t want to be the reason that you die

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill
Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill
