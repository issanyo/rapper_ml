[Verse 1]
It's always funny when life is going well
All I can do is fall under the spell
Some days in my head is where I dwell
And sometimes I can't save myself from hell
I'm forever in the middle, I could snap or I could giggle
I have yet to find the thing that determines which way I'm leanin'
I'm rarely up on the scene and whenever I do get seen
Just know I wanted to do a show, give a fuck about an appearance
You talk, I never hear it, you dropped, I never seen it
Whether it's platinum or it sold four, still wouldn't wanna be ya
You pop, then end up freezin', locked in the box they see you
Stuck in the mud with creatures who never had your best interests
You thought shit could be different, now you just appeasing
People that don't really need you, you need them so bad you fiending

[Hook]
This life has got you
This life has got you
This life has got you
This life has got you

[Chorus]
Just another victim and you can't come back
Just another doll with a string in his back
Same old lines on the same old tracks
What
Just another victim and you can't come back
Just another doll with a string in his back
Same old lines on the same old tracks

[Break]
Wait
SESH
Bones
What

[Verse 2]
Same old number, brand new home
Just wish that I could call my little brother on the phone
Everything we done, I just wish that I could show 'em, I owe 'em
Forever better I gotta chance to know 'em
I dream about him every night, so every day I'm waking up
Picturing his face smiling, eyes lit up
Never have I seen such a beautiful picture
The sky don't get blue no more, it only get darker

[Hook]
This life has got me
This life has got me
This life has got me
This life has got me
