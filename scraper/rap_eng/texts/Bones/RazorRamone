[Intro: Himself the Majestic]
Yeah
Nature, nature, nature
Burn it up in the spot
Fuck the cops

[Verse 1: Himself the Majestic]
It's the spic of the year
Got hoes in my ear
Telling me they wanna hold me down, gimme years
No simp in my bones
No slack in my mack
Rather lose or get before I pay with a stack
No stars in the cut, drove cars over ice
Froze broads lemme fuck they fans overnight
Plans oversight
You old mans wanna fight
Stands got a hype, my hands hold a pipe
I'm thunder flow tundra
Got them razor raps for them hundreds
And she lay me back with that dumb head
Went to beauty school
But she flunked it
Now she calling me shaq when I dunk it
Got the stealing toe for them suckers
Like Shazaam I wish they won't duck us
But when money talk It Chris Tucker
Im seen with the green
High wit a hoe
Blue dream blowin fiend
Yall fiends for my style
Out with ya gout
Leader on my nuts
Hardy boys frown
Bacardi pourin down
Never had a name now they wait for my appearance
[?]

[Verse 2: Bones]
What?
Drugs, drugs drugs
All I do is fucking drugs
Fuck, fuck, fuck
I could never give a fuck
Ok my top back and I'm leanin'
I got two twelves and they screamin'
They telling me that my flow is dope
That's why all these bitches be fiending
Cause they need it
Cause they cheatin'
Boy run up quick and start bleeding
They get beatin'
Better believe it
See I pull up quick to retrieve it
She got back, hop in the lac
Right after that I'mma delete her
Turn her phone off get her freak on
I call that bitch misdemeanor
I don't ride around with no nina
I don't ride around in no beamer
See she pass out and she dream of me
Now I'm calling that bitch Celina
I got 30 up in my clip
I put like 30 up in that bitch
See I got money up in my pocket
Better believe you can catch a hit
Catch a lit
Got that clich√©
Rap on replay
Everything they hate
About the world with a delay
Drowned in the reverb
Getting what I deserve
Lotta long nights
Fuck second chase dreams first
I can wait, oh baby no I can wait
No name, no face
No license on the fucking plate
I'm gone
