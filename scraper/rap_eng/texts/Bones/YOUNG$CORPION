[Hook]
Jump into the Chevy hit the dashboard get the mask
Jump into the Chevy hit the dashboard get the mask
Jump into the Chevy hit the dashboard get the mask
Jump into the Chevy hit the dashboard get the mask
Jump into the Chevy hit the dashboard get the mask
Jump into the Chevy hit the dashboard get the mask
Jump into the Chevy hit the dashboard get the mask
Jump into the Chevy hit the dashboard get the mask
Jump into the Chevy hit the dashboard get the mask

[Verse]
Comin' up quick as I snickered so sick
Mac on my lap I got a ten in the clip
One for my bitch I got one for the snitch
One in the trunk I got two in the ditch
One in the river and one in the woods
One in the freezer and one at the school
Put on my hat and then bring out the tool
Riddle the clip and aim it at you
Bang, never shot a gun at a human being
And that's a rule I promise myself I will never break
I didn't bring you in, I'm not gonna take you out
Except for your bitch she know I'm the kid so she want me to take her out
She want me to take her down, to the underworld
Young scorpion, get over here I told you, girl
I'm the fucking man, bringing that white noise
Gold chain shinin' fuck these other white boys
Cuz I'm the right now, and you're the never man
With my large boys killing blunts out in Neverland
Bricks in the caravan, iced out everything
Wood grain when I switch lanes
Paint dripping like candy mane

[Outro]
Jump into the Chevy hit the dashboard get the mask
Jump into the Chevy hit the dashboard get the mask
Jump into the Chevy hit the dashboard get the mask
Jump into the Chevy hit the dashboard get the mask
Jump into the chevy
Jump into the chevy
Jump into the chevy
Jump into the chevy
