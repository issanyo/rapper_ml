[Verse 1]
Sipping on that Tanqueray
Feeling like it's fucking 98
Raindrops on my windshield
Just get me proof, I seen brighter days
Swinging lanes in that caddy
Stuntin' like my daddy
Blown switches at the red lights
And pouring up on the alleys
See, the cops really don't like me
But then again, motherfuck 'em
Cause the only thing they try to see
Is a white pimp get busted
A couple chains on my neck
Let me know they ain't take 'em yet
I pay dues, I catch the check
And I get flow, so pay respect

[Hook]
Tanqueray in my system
The bassline I'm flowin'
Slidin' 'round your city
My diamonds shinin', they glowin'
Tanqueray in my system
The bassline I'm flowin'
Slidin' 'round your city
My diamonds shinin', they glowin'

[Outro]
They know I'm screaming "fuck they"
Till the day I'm in the dirt
Boy, I'm screaming "fuck they"
