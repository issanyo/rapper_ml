[Intro: Bones & Xavier Wulf]
This is a brand new (uh huh) hip-hop mix straight from the streets
Street single smash
Hot 97 (damn) bringing it to ya
We all go through a lot of difficult things
Just remember that
Damn
Uh huh
Wahhhhhhh
Ahh

[Hook: Xavier Wulf]
Call me WeatherMan I'm wherever man
It's so hard trying to keep some cash in
Now I'm sending ice out of all directions
Why this world gotta work like this
Call me WeatherMan I'm wherever man
It's so hard trying to keep some cash in
Now I'm sending ice out of all directions
Why this world gotta work like this
Call me WeatherMan I'm wherever man
It's so hard trying to keep some cash in
Now I'm sending ice out of all directions
Why this world gotta be like this

[Verse: Bones]
Ridin' down the PCH sipping on some PCP
Rhyming that's a piece of cake so I'll always eat for free
Say the game in need of me cause I don't even need a beat
Say I mean a lot to rap but that don't mean a thing to me
Rather grow old get a place out in the forest
On the porch of my cabin smoking dope eating porridge
Ounce of the snow coming down on the road
White skin like Jack Frost got your bitch cold
Let it go
Every night I'm dying slow
Eyes never closed cause you never, never know
What
Coming down on the road
