[Verse]
Fuck being you, I'm me (me)
Fuck being cool, I'm Bones (Bones)
See I'm posted up with my team (team)
Young white punk on dope (dope)
Creep in the night, my hoodie up
And my hands deep in my pockets (pockets)
My white gripping that switchblade
My mind thinking about nothing (nothing)
But dying (dying) and trying (trying)
Real hard to stray from this violence
See, my whole life I've been dreaming (dreaming)
'Bout the night that I don't hear sirens (no)
I got Marvin Gaye on that vinyl (vinyl)
He's spinning 'round while I'm rolling (rolling)
What's Going On on that repeat
Thinking 'bout what my father told me (told me)
"Love every second you get (get)
Love every night that you sleep (sleep)
Love every morning you wake
Because you may not live another day to see"
Oh
Yeah
What?
Saturn
Bones
Everything is...
