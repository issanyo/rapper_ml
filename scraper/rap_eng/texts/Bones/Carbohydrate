[Verse]
Hold up don't get me started
I cannot beg your pardon
I'm not too keen on talking
But I can't hold my tongue
No more, I'm a failure at home
And on road
It never matters where I'm at, I'm gonna fold
No hope, no goals
I'm fading slow
I gotta get back to my zone
Back in my mode
Where I was born, made gold
And made more
Molds for these rappers
Then I thought, like "oh no"
Don't move, razor in your face
Till your body grow cold
