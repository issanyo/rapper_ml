[Verse]
Alley way lurking
Skinny white fuck with the lights so perfect
Wake up then I'm working
Living fucking legend so these females smirking
Back of the limo
Tears on the pillow
She'd rather be with bones blowing O's playing Nintendo
She blowing on the cartridge
Me I'm rolling bones up
Ashtray grave yard, howl till the moon's up
Japanese animation on my laptop
[?] castle on the screen give a fuck what
You gotta say, motherfuck your diamond chains
Fools gold on my neck till that bitch turn green
See the breeze, trees, feeling leaves on your feet
Day time turns night, strong winds get weak
Storm dies down, so high right now
Marvin Gaye playing loud in the cold background
