{Verse 1}

You aint your own man boy
You're just my biggest fan boy
You saw me in the flesh
Now you're moving like a dead boy
Try to be the creep you seeing
Now you leeching like a cretin
even if everyday you breathin
know that it aint your life you leadin
try to be just what youll never be
you must be off that ketamine
look at us and see and think
but still we're what they came to see
Present day im a better me
give me space now let me breathe
always seems to be a so called fan
thats simulating me
resenting me
recreating me
but there is no placing me
lately
i been patiently awaiting to see
every second every hour
every drought with every shower
every atom and every fractal
take em all and fucking clash em
im the rapture im the captain
just make sure youre belt is fasten
i aint leaving unless you bleeding
cuz i need my satisfaction
got me passin', sympathetic
what the fuck is in your brain
another fucking verse
boutta block 'em with a curse
with another damn rock that you know you don't slang

{Hook}

Woah now
Woah now
Need to slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Whats the Lo-Down
