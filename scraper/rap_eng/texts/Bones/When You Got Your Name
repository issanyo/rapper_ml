[Hook: Mitch]
When you got your name
When you got your shape
You might be here
Or which way we stay
When you're alone
Stay faith from fear
When you are-
Stay faith from fear

[Verse: Bones]
Aye
Still bitching  at the frame (frame)
Still itching at my veins (veins)
Clouds don't like me, so they drops don't touch me
Stay dry when I'm walking through the rain (bitch)
Tryna get away from the smog (smog)
Zoomin out just to see what's wrong (Aye)
Atomsphere tattered with holes from the ashes
That actually come from the ones that don't matter (fuck)
Used to be at the place where they fiend at
Where they need that, got it then they react (ah)
Only relapse, Never recover
I am the one that shows faith. but never hides undercovers
I got em shiverin' quiverin' then I stop
Look them in the face say, "What, speak up?" (aye)
Geophony, probably placed in an obsolete setting
Is all that I hear when you isolate
Ima tell the truth
I hope you leave earth in the maybach coup
Hundred chains on and the Glock nine drawn
Hundred thousand for the charm, but it's free when you gone (aye)
Money all around, boy I'm glad you got some (what?)
It's about time that you finally did some (yeah)
Placed in a place that I sure didnâ€™t ask to be (no)
Fatal catastrophe

[Bridge: Bones]
When you're all alone
I know it isn't fair
You scream out those words
I pull out my hair
My body's made of atoms and every molecule's for you
They scream your name
As we float through space
When you're all alone
I know it isn't fair
You scream out those words
I pull out my hair
My body's made of atoms and every molecule's for you
They scream your name
As we float through space

[Hook: Mitch]
When you got your name
When you got your shape
You might be here
Or which way we stay
When you're alone
Stay faith from fear
When you are
Stay faith from fear
