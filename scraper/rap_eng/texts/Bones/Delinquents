[Verse 1: Bones]
What?
Young white pimp, switchblade on my dick
Blunt guts in my veins, Backwoods on my lips
I ain't ridin' with a clip, (no) I'm ridin' with my clique
No tent, let 'em see me when I'm ridin' in the whip
Black beeper on my hip, buzzin' hard like a bitch
(SESH)
Nextel makin' moves, and I make a bitch strip
(What?)
Feed her drugs, watch her die, I'mma help the suicide
All my girls goin' to die when they see I have a ride
When they see just how I act, when they hear just how I rap
All black to the hat, now I'm creepin' for the cash
Flashback to the past, now I'm pimpin' in the flash
Fuck whoever said I wouldn't, gettin' cash, flickin' ash
I'm, bitch, livin' life like a prince
Got jewels on my hands, heirlooms on my wrist
I'm, what, livin' like a motherfuckin' prince
Got jewels on my hands, heirlooms on my wrist
What?

[Verse 2: Eddy Baker]
Eddy fuckin' Baker, bitch, know I'm high off the dope
Got the grams in my pocket and a scale in my coat
Killin' every fuckin' beat, yeah, it's murder he wrote (murder he wrote)
Try to play me for a ho, then I'm grabbin' your throat (I'm grabbin' your throat)
God damn, I'm so dope like a bag of the blow
Fucked your bitch in the bathroom and you didn't even know (didn't even know)
I just hit it from the back while she sniffin' the snow
Bust a nut in her face then I hit the backdo' (damn)
I'm a crook, motherfucker, got no love for the po' (fuck you)
I can never wife a bitch, I'm in love with the dough (I'm in love with the dough)
Got some plugs on the drugs, I can get 'em for low (fuck with me)
Ecstasy, marijuana, even pints of the poe (alright)
My niggas stay in the streets but we still keep it low
Little blunts, little fuck, then we hittin' the sto' (Smoke sum)
I can never get enough, always fiendin' some mo' (real shit)
Bad bitch on my dick, how deep can I go?
Yup, Yeah
