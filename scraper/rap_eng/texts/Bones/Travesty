[Verse 1]
I swear that Imma shine for a century
From the outside peekin' in like it's meant for me
Looking up at the stars like it's meant to be
Flickin' blunts watchin' ash fight gravity
Death by dope I'm a casualty
A walking travesty I am what's bad for me
Came up from the sewer got trash in me
Ever since I came in and changed the game
They been mad at me
64 grams of gold bouncin' off my neck
Heavy but its something light man it ain't shit but a check
Never sweat rent I get triple that then I jet
I went my whole life without gettin' paid for shit

[Verse 2]
(What)
Smoke one blunt then I roll two more
Triple that's three sparked in a four-door
SESH to the boots get stomped and abused
Till' my face turn blue I'm the screw that's loose
Smoke one blunt then I roll two more
Triple that's three sparked in a four-door
SESH to the boots get stomped and abused
Till' my face turn blue I'm the screw that's loose

[Outro]
I be so gone
AFK going AFK
I be so gone
AFK going AFK
