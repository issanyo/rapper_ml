What?
SESH
What?

[Hook]
You say you've got them guns, but I've never seen you bang (bang)
You say you've got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang (slang)
You say you're in the game, but I've yet to see you play (play)
You say you're going hard, but nobody feels the same (no)
You say you've got them guns, but I've never seen you bang (bang)
You say you've got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang (slang)
You say you're in the game, but I've yet to see you play (play)
You say you're going hard, but nobody feels the same

[Verse]
I'm swerving off, my eyes closed, graveyard's what I call home
Razor blade on my fuckin bones, touch me and I'ma cut you off
Raindrops on my white skin, turn ghost and I'm in my zone (what?)
Hair long, my bluntâ€™s short, always smoke so we rollin' more
Coming down, coming down, see me but don't hear a sound
Ridin' 'round, ridin' 'round, Cemetary Blunts in the background loud
Now now, burn it all to the ground
To the ground, ground, Bones back in town
I ain't got no fucking chain, I ain't got no diamond ring
Young Justin Timberlake, all these bitches know my name
If you see me out in public then you know I got the blade
If you see me on the stage (what?)
You know I got the blade (SESH)
Hundred pills in my pocket but that shit is not for me (no)
I feed 'em to my girl and watch her drop down to her knees (what?)
Ghosts in my head, I got ash on my jeans
These women tryna scheme cause I look like Dawson's Creek (what?)

[Hook]
You say you've got them guns, but I've never seen you bang (bang)
You say you've got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang (slang)
You say you're in the game, but I've yet to see you play (what?)
You say you're going hard, but nobody feels the same (SESH)
You say you've got them guns, but I've never seen you bang (what?)
You say you've got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang (slang)
You say you're in the game, but I've yet to see you play (bitch)
You say you're going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah

[Outro]
What, what, what, what
What, what, what, what
What, what, what, what
What?
