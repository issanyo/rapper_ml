[Verse 1: Bones]
Every night I stay up getting high
'Til the point where my body is falling asleep
Gotta catch up on my eyes
I can't show you I'm struggling, sick of counting sheep
Even days when I'm feeling down, low
I don't let the blunt hit the ground, no
WaterSesh bumping louder than a trumpet
Think they didn't know us but now they know
Now in a crowd, there is nowhere to go
Turned an empty room into a sold-out show
Now they bring us up like 'Oh, I know'
They got it, all they wanted, did it all alone

[Verse 2: Chris Travis]
I see you from a far
Girl, you've been in my heart
I don't know where to start
I just caught on so sharp
I look you in your eye
[?]
These days are so strange
I just need you to be there
Need to know that you care
(Instrumental)

[Hook: Bones]
Every little thing you said
Spinning in my head
Every little thing you said
Spinning in my head

[Verse 3: Chris Travis]
I'm just rolling through, not patrolling you
Couple waves ahead, I might be over you
Say I'm overdue, can't feel overused
She was with me at that moment so she's posted too
On my side at the time I was still a troop
Breaking rules on the move but I never removed
These days I can say give me 10 or 2
I play to win, I lose
I get in, I snooze

[Hook: Bones]
Every little thing you said
Spinning in my head
Every little thing you said
Spinning in my head
