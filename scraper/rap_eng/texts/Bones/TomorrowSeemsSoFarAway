[Verse]
Open the pack is it good enough, I don't know, I don't know, wait
Soon as I look at the gar, I know if we going far
If it seem we only got one, we gotta hop in the car
Rollin', red lights, killing roaches in the moonlight
Stay down, lay down, I will never go
I will make sure you are never cold
You wanna bust out that AP
You want a millie the first week
You gotta go harder than that
Riding in the hearse all black
I just wanna tell it how it is
I just wanna tell it how it is

[Chorus]
Tomorrow seems so far away
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
Tomorrow seems so far away
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
