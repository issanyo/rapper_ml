[Chorus]
Going through the motions, I
Be caught up in emotions, I'm
Going through the motions, I'm
Too fast can't hold on, I'm
Going through the motions, I
Be caught up in emotions, I'm
Going through the motions, I'm
Too fast can't hold on, I'm

[Verse 1]
Diamonds on my wrist, oh
Diamonds on my neck too, oh
Yes I can watch them glisten
But none of that gon' mean shit when
I'm down, down, lower than low
Money ain't shit when you're six feet low
Baby that's just the truth about it
There's no way around it

[Chorus]
Going through the motions, I
Be caught up in emotions, I'm
Going through the motions, I'm
Too fast can't hold on, I'm
Going through the motions, I
Be caught up in emotions, I'm
Going through the motions, I'm
Too fast can't hold on, I'm

[Verse 2]
People I never talk to
Turn and they say I'm awful
They don't even know me
Fuck you
Put it on everything I love
Family, my lady, my team, and no
They can never figure us out too
Count it up
Count it all
Count it up
Count it all
Mount it up
Mount it up
Mount it up
Mount it up
