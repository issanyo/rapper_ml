Niggas on banana peels always gettin' that bullet drill
Dead in they motherfucking face, where it hurt the most
Niggas on banana peels always gettin' that bullet drill
Dead in they motherfucking face, where it hurt the most
Niggas on banana peels always gettin' that bullet drill
Dead in they motherfucking face, where it hurt the most
Niggas on banana peels always gettin' that bullet drill
Dead in they motherfucking face, where it hurt the most

[Verse]
Gateway drugs gateway blunt
Blowin' smoke and catch a gateway bus
Get crunk while I'm rollin' up
Young Lil John, high up
Gateway drugs in my cup
Gateway drugs in my blunt
I got the key in my hand and my key in the gate and I'm bout to open up like
Open sesame
Rescue me from my destiny
What's left of me is a recipe of Mountain Dew and phetamines
Flows sick, definitely
Cool as shit, yes sir-ee
Puttin' it down 'till I'm down in the ground a hundred years from now and you won't remember me
Friend of me, enemy, either way dead to me
Tires they blow, pedals keep pedaling
Wheelie keep turning, blunts keep on burning
Cadillac swerving, bangin' the curbs
Young dumbfuck with a blunt full of herb
Lessons I've learned, bridges I've burned
Dues that I've paid, tables I've turned
Fuck that noise I got money to earn
Fuck is up?
Puttin' it down 'till your bitch pick it up
Bitch that's enough I wind up in the trunk
One on the trigger and one on the Glock
Servin' the fiends up on the block
Bitch I rhyme, but bitch I rap
They can lie, then so can I yuh
