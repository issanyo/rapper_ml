[Verse]
Take all your pain and put it in a bag
Hide it in a place where no one knows it's at
I save all our memories and store them in my head
You saved me once, I remember that

Photographs we took scattered on the floor
What good is looking at 'em, when they're not worth looking for?
Life is just a battle, every day, forever more
Separated by the sun and moon, I feel ignored

[Hook]
Like light beams off lighthouses
Whose shine catches no eyes at night

Sent out a bottle and got no reply
My message inside
Sent out a bottle and got no reply
My message inside

[Hook]
Like light beams off lighthouses
Whose shine catches no eyes at night

Sent out a bottle and got no reply
My message inside
Sent out a bottle and got no reply
My message inside
