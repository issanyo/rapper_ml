So many people have helped me to come to this night
Some of you are here
Some are far away
Some are even in heaven
All of us have special ones who have loved us into being
Would you just take along with me
Ten seconds to think about the people who have helped you become who you are
Those who have cared about you
And wanted what was best for you in life
Ten seconds of silence
I'll watch the time...
Whomever you've been thinking about
How pleased they must be to know the difference you feel they've made
