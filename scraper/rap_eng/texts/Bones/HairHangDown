[Intro]
Sesh
Bones

[Verse]
I let my hair hang down like fuck it
I don’t wanna see no busters
Say the word round town is you buzzin
Well that's a lie because we know you nothing
We going live from the pit I'm above you
He stand in the pit he runnin
If you ever see me at a function
Know a lots changed I ain’t there for no huggin

[Hook]
I think your better
Think your better
Think you're better off
If you paid me no mind
And let me set it off
Now I'm drowning in the pond where
I say my final words

[Post Hook]
Where did he go
Where did he go
Tell me don't phase me
Now where did he go
Where did he go
Where did he go
Tell me don't phase me
Now where did he go
Where did he go
Where did he go
Tell me don't phase me
Now where did he go
Where did he go
Where did he go
Tell me don't phase me
Now where did he go

[Outro]
Where did I go
Where did I go
Tell me don't phase me
Now where did I go
Where did I go
Where did I go
Tell me don't phase me
Now where did I go
Where did I go
Where did I go
Tell me don't phase me
Now where did I go
Where did I go
Where did I go
Tell me don't phase me
Now where did I go
