[Hook x2: Bones]
All we do is drugs
All we do is smoke
All we do is roll blunts all day long [x2]

[Verse 1: Bones]
Cigar full of drugs
I take it to my lungs, I feel it in my veins
Bitch i’m as high as fucking nutz
Mountain full of ash, let you know i’m fucking ca$hed
All I do is rap, bitch all I do is SESH

Riding up the block with my brothers, bumping my shit (my shit)
When I hear my shit, I can’t believe that it’s my shit
Now I am eighteen, dropped out at sixteen
Out in LA and they all still back in Michigan

[Hook x2: Bones]
All we do is drugs
All we do is smoke
All we do is roll blunts all day long [x2]
