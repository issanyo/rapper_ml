[Verse 1: Bones]
At the top of Topanga
Looking down on you
We don't fucking know you
There's not a thing that we owe you
New blade, new metal
Blackwood on the gloss still handleÂ 
SESH written on the sign
Welcome to the land of the rhymes
House made with our own two hands
When you see it's a whole new land
Snakes sleep in the dirt
Talk down you can sleep in a hearse
Fresh green, pink roses
Bees buzzing as I'm backwood rolling
All natural, when I'm smoking
All natural, when I'm flowing
Everything homemade
From the drank to the fruit that we eat
So close to the sun
Wake up then I bloom
Rocks underneath my feet
Mud slide when it rain
Everything that we dream
Every plan that was made
Right now all falling into place
It ain't fake cause we made it that way
Fresh lemonade smoking in the shade
Team SESH till' the end of days
Once you come to the trap
There ain't no turning back
Microphone lotta drugs in the mattress
Alcohol and some subwoofer's blastin'
I don't rap, I make magic
SESH
