[Verse 1]
Uh
I'm radical to the maximum
Smokin' all these rappers and ashin' on all the rest of 'em
Hope I got the best of 'em, they hopin' it's the last of me, but back again I go unloading what was left in me
Uh
I let this dirty beat get to me
Now I'm fuckin' filthy as fuck and you can't stand near me
They can't stand me, let alone jam me, and every fuckin' speaker to the transistor's jammed, see
The raps that banter funny like bad stand up
When tomatoes hit the stage, you hang it up
So bring out the cartoon broom and sweep me, under the mat like three keys, one key chain, one key to your house, and 2 backup for whenever you locked out, see

[Outro]
My rhymes radical you know you gotta grab a few
Yeah
Uh
My rhymes radical you know you gotta grab a few
Nowww... (Check it out, check it out)
