[Intro: ATC]
The kisses of the sun - Were sweet I didn't blink
I let it in my eyes - Like an exotic drink
The radio playing songs - That I have never heard
I don't know what to say - Oh not another word

[Verse 1: Bones]
I don't wanna hear your voice (voice)
Motherfuck you and your boys (boys)
Bitch, you can never make noise (noise)
Sit the fuck down, get low (low)
Sitting in the back of the pick-up (pick-up)
Got a razor with the hinge and it lifts up (lifts up)
Tucked in my shirt like a stick-up
Promise you ain't leavin' if we don't get shit uhhhh, so up
You don't wanna die, get down
Adrenaline runnin' to the sky right now
You don't wanna die, get down
Adrenaline runnin' to the sky right now

[Hook: Bones]
I'm always down to die, put my blade on it (blade on it)
Drive my body to the plot with my grave on it (grave on it)
Granite headstone, bitch, with my name on it (name on it)
Birthday dash, no date bitch, now what's that say on it?

[Outro: Bones]
I don't wanna stay, I can never leave
I'll never disappear, Bones always remain
I don't wanna stay, I can never leave
I'll never disappear, Bones always remain
