[Hook]
Every night before I fall asleep
I roll over and see you next to me
Every night before I fall asleep
I roll over and see you next to me

[Verse 1]
Next to me, right beside me
Sitting next to you, right beside you
Sitting next to me, right beside me
Sitting next to you, right beside you

[Hook]
Every night before I fall asleep
I roll over and see you next to me
Every night before I fall asleep
I roll over and see you next to me

[Verse 2]
Dance the night away, dance the night away
Dance the night away, dance the night away
Look into my eyes
Everything is fine
Look into my eyes
Everything is fine
