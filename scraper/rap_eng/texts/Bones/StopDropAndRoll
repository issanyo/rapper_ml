[Verse]
Load it and shoot you like b.g_i
Diamond different colors like Fiji skies
Blade always hiding like he's too shy
You lookin like you’d be pleased to die
Tell me the truth, when I look at you
I take your soul, I don't want your loot
I need to go, I gotta bail
Don't know why you scared but you feel it like braille
Stop, drop, and roll, the flame is my attire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
Cold bottle, hot steel, put that shit together
You’re the beer, I'm the razor, now it's IPA infection
I won't hate bitch fuck affection, you not allowed up in my section
I first guess, I never second
I know who's there no need for checkin
When I got on it was "fuck 'em all"
When I got rollin it was "crush 'em all"
You take deals, you pop pills, you bow down, I never will
Never feel sympathetic for you pussies tryin to get it
We up in it, we all did it, it's up to you to get it correctly
You like Bentleys, I like trucks, got this game bottled up
Condensation, got ’em hatin ’cause they views ain't adding up
I never wanted that, bitch I just wanted to rap
While the rest want pixels on the screen converting to likes that’s a fact
I'm the bat in the night, flying high above the lights
Fuck you plebs, I'll be Sesh to the night I fuckin die
