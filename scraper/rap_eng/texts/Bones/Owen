[Verse]
Dumb white fuck
Scum from the jump
Trash from the dump every limb stay numb
35 blunts and the sun ain't up
I don't need to rush and you ain't gotta wait up
Either way umm ima make way up while you coming to the finish
You will see me splitting ribbons really wish that they were kidding
When they say that I be killin but they mean it bitch
I put it down you couldn't even leave it couldn't lay it I'm archaic
I'm the fire in the basement I'm the bomb in the attic
I'm your heart when its racing stone cold theme song when I really get it going
Mick foley car crash droppin like owen
RIP to the blue fucking blazer
And fuck the people behind the scenes that didn't make sure it was safer
