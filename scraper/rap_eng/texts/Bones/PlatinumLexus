[Hook: Bones]
It's 1992, blunts on the stoop
Just got some new shoes to match my new tool
Brand new tech, all gold clip
Diamond hollow tips with a ruby red grip
Bathtub of cash, living life lavish
30 blunts later and I'm still getting cash
Skinny White Pimp, but you can call me Bones
Blanco skin, chain made of fools gold

[Verse 1: Bones]
We popping Cristal, we just live in the now
Nobody promised tomorrow so all we got is the now
See all I got is my flow, see all I got is my team
See all I got is my money, just please don't come in between
Because I don't give a fuck about taking a life
I'll do a 9-5 to prove I'm about that life
You see the coke white skin and my big ass diamonds
Swanging lane to lane, hat low, profiling
Kid's on the playground, I was inside
Writing my thoughts down but in the form of rhymes
Never gave a fuck I'm not even about to lie
Every time I rap I do it like I'm about to die
Cuz life it's been changing, the rolls been rearranging
Got a 4 door Platinum Lexus
Bass locked in the trunk just banging

[Hook: Bones]
It's 1992, blunts on the stoop
Just got some new shoes to match my new tool
Brand new tech, all gold clip
Diamond hollow tips with a ruby red grip
Bathtub of cash, living life lavish
30 blunts later and I'm still getting cash
Skinny White Pimp, but you can call me Bones
Blanco skin, chain made of fools gold
