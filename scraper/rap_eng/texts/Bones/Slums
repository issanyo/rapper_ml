[Verse 1]
I was fifteen going on sixteen
My only dream to be out of that city
We drank tangarade, we drink aliz√©
The snow fell down, we play shallow days
Flash back to those memories
Flickin ash on that fendi
Sending drinks to my enemies
Crackin smiles for all those that envy
I got 24s, poking out
At the club I'm showing out
Still tippin, im still sippin
Its 2AM, they still trippin

(Hook:)
Kids in the slums, shining up they guns
Get home safe, know you still you're mommas son
Don't lose that life, you'll never get it back
Don't choose that life, wind up on the wrong track

Verse 2:

My mother staying up late night
Her fingers crossed that I'm safe
I'm acting dumb, my phone's off
Last time we talked i screamed
See all i can do is hope
My kids are nothing like me
I put my parents through hell and back
And still somehow they love me
I know some people don't get that
Somebody gonna hit that
Cigars stuffed to the rim with drugs
Looking out the cut like who is that
Pulling up in that all black
Hearse so you know it's me
It's that young skinny pimp, flows something like breeze

(Hook:)

Kids in the slums, shining up they guns
Get home safe, know you still you're mommas son
Don't lose that life, you'll never get it back
Don't choose that life, wind up on the wrong track
