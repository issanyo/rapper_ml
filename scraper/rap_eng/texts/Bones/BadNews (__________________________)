[Hook 1]
Nightmare please come my way
I don’t wanna sleep tonight
Nightmares keep me awake
I don’t need good dreams tonight

[Verse 1]
Boo
SHWB dipped in diamonds, watch it boom
Smoke too fading just like Boosie Boo, do watch me Zoom
Wipe me down, hop in the crowd, comin' back with all my jewels
My deadboys know the rules, mud up on my shoes

[Hook 2]
Bad news in my brain cells
I think I’m okay but I can’t tell
Bad news in my brain cells
I think I’m okay but I can’t tell

[Verse 2]
What?
Fine China blunts with the porcelain smoke
Nowadays there's no shortage on the poor man's Bones
Look around, see the game, take it in, what you say?
Too much death in my veins, I can't live off what you think
(SESH)

[Hook 1]
Nightmare please come my way
I don’t wanna sleep tonight
Nightmares keep me awake
I don’t need good dreams tonight
