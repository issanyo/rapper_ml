[Verse]
Like a blade of grass floating on the river bend, so slowly
I don't know, I don't know where I'm gonna end, can you show me?
It was a dark night, taking in the moonlight
Never thought I'd stand where I stood I
Always thought I should so I would I
It's not even a fucking question as to if you're worth it
