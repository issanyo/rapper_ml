[Verse 1]
You are life as I know it
I am thankful just to know you
Every time that I've wronged you
It burns me up like my cauldron
Comprised of all that is lonesome
Mixed with endless emotions
I don't know what I will do without you

[Hook]
When it all seem to fall into place
Is it that much different now
When it all seems seem to fall into place
Is it that much different now

[Bridge]
You are life as I know it
I am thankful just to know you
Every time that I've wronged you

[Verse 2]
One thing
Two things
Three things
Many things
I would do to show my dedication
Admiration for you

[Outro]
Waiting oh so long
Waiting oh so long
Waiting oh so long
Waiting oh so long
Waiting oh so long
