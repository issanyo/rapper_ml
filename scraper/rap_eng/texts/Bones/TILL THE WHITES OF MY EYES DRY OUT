[Verse]
Till the whites of my eyes dry out
I'll be watching every move you make
Till the whites of my eyes dry out
I'll be watching everything you do
Till the whites of my eyes dry out
I'll be watching every move you make

[Hook]
You showed me feeling I have never felt
You showed me moments I will never forget
You showed me feeling I have never felt
You showed me moments I will never forget

[Outro]
You're the one, you've always been
You're the one, you've always been
I'm always saying things that I don't mean to you
