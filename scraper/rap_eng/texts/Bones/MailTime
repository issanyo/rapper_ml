[Verse]
Still will kill bitch cuz I don't speak for real
Keep it quiet you would never see it coming till you feel
Buck knife to your spine run it quickly to the sky
Open you just like a letter let me read just whats inside
Like its mail time mail time hit the alpine
Now we bumpin' smokin' blunts get to it like its bout time
In and out of route time pit stop to count mine
I need every decimal essential for this ounce I'm bankin' on
Cashin' off you show out I laugh it off you go out I stay at home
Still your funds is lookin'  low I ain't one to give a fuck about a couple dollars
But I know you are so tell me how the fuck you plan to pile up
If you wilder than the wildest that would be me lets be honest
So just take your 2nd rank and take your silver to get polished
Shadow box it make it gorgeous put it on the wall to worship
Only thing I frame is progress for me that's a perfect portrait
Everybody dressing up and doing all their best impressions
Oh so many Bones imitations I'ma start a convention
All your shows look like dashcon stage like a ball pit
Under developed brain somehow stuck inside some tall kids
Fuck about your talking and your posting keep it going
Its final cut the way they over saturate their own shit
If they wanna know you you just one click away
If they wanna get to Bones that's just something they'll have to dream

Got some woods in the duffel
Got some blades just to touch em
They got money that's lovely
Cuz I got shit I been wantin'
Got some woods in the duffel
Got some blades just to touch em
They got money that's lovely
Cuz I got shit I been wantin'
Got some woods in the duffel
Got some blades just to touch em
You got money? that's lovely
Cuz I got shit I been wantin'
