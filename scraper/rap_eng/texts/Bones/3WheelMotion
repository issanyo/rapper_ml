[Verse]

I hit the three wheel motion
I'm guttin' swishers while I'm mixin' up the potion
My rims like thorns always stay pokin'
Bath full of cash got lungs full of roses
These white kids don't impress me
On something one week off that next week
Black skully no shirt gold lynx
I'm the best cracker rapper flow give 'em cold feet
Drown in the bass
Drown in my ways
The water gets deep and my mind starts to change
Actin' like you in it to win it but you just in it for pictures
See just in it to talk about it
Just it in it to picture yourself on stage givin' crowds what they need to get wild get [?] get [?]
Born in the day I was raised in the night
See young fuckin' ghost good luck tryna fight me
Always with the team you know where to find me
Always seems to be the white kids that don't like me
Ain't about race no it's all about sound but my mind starts talking and it's speakin' out loud
Thinkin' out loud I'm just talkin' to myself should I give the game life should I give the game death
