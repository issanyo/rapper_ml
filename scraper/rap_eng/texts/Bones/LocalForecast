[Verse: Bones]
Riding in the back of the hearse it's the
Young dead boy one hand out the dirt
Lurking is for sure flicking ash on the curb
Every verse is a curse scorched marks in the earth
Wicked as could be, wicked as the sea
See the waves coming down like my high when you leave
Can't breathe, can't see, can't do a fucking thing
Can't eat, can't sleep, bitch you turn me to a freak
Drain the blood from my veins hang me outside in the breeze
Throw my body to the birds if you don’t need me
Drain the blood from my veins hang me outside in the breeze
Throw my body to the birds if you don’t need me

[Hook: Bones]
I’ve got something for you and baby if you let me
I could show you just what it is you’ve been missing
I’ve been sleeping by the river, waking in the hills
And I've still yet to find anything real
I’ve got something for you and baby if you let me
I could show you just what it is you’ve been missing
I’ve been sleeping by the river, waking in the hills
And I've still yet to find anything real
