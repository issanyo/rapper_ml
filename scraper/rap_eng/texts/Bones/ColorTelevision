[Verse]
Color Television, Fans on the ceiling
Abstract art on the walls, living different
1989, talking on the phone
Wind blowing hard, all the windows closed
Turquoise sheets, pink pillows
Motel six that's room twenty four
Meet you in the morning, meet me here tonight
Vibrating bed, got a saying alright
Black marble sink, gold in the faucets
Fresh bar soap, mini shampoo bottles
Playing some Atari, if she blowing on my cartridge
Room service knocking, I can hear them at the door
Do not disturb, hanging on the knob
Shady part of town, but I'm floating on a cloud
Tell her meet me at the motel six
We got drugs and a color television
White noise screens, tell her she can scream
Loud as she wants, let her know how she feels
Pearls on her ears, heels on her feet
Slipping off her dress and she sipping on a drink
I was at the bottom, I know thats how she like it
Turning off the lights and I'm turning up the Marvin

[Hook]
Tell her meet me at the motel six
We got drugs and a color television
Tell her meet me at the motel six
We got drugs and a color television
