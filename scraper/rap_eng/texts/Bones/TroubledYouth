[Verse]
I don't want to wake, I don't want to sleep
I don't want to suffocate, I don't want to breathe
I don't want to drown, I don't want to sink
Deep, deep down to the bottom of the sea
The top of the mountain, snow on the peak
Bitch, I'm the creak in the floor when I creep
Teenage witch, I don't need a bitch
I don't want a chain, I don't need a whip
Still gettin' cash, still flickin' ash
See you actin' hard and I can't hold back
I need you to know, I don't want to see
I don't want to hear you talkin' bout me
