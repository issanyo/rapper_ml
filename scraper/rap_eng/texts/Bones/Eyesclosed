[Verse: Bones]
I'ma pour a glass while I take another drag
It's the teenage trash comin' straight up out the Ave
One, two, three Bones ridin' down the street
Mister five one seven flow D-19
They don't know me and I don't know them
Sittin' in the dark speaking same old hymns
Heartagram chain looking just like HIM
Now they see me and they wanna be like him
Nobody ever ready for the money when it heavy
And it come so quick, I ain't even do shit
Floating in the pool, I ain't really ever swim
Eyes closed, head back, just listen to the wind
(Bitch I'm ridin' down your block today x2)

[Chorus: Bones] (x2)
The breeze speaks in colors and somehow
I understand
The wind touches me with such delicate hands
