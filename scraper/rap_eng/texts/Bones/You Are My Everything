[Hook x2]
I can no longer breathe if you are not here so I don't
I don't, I don't
I can no longer see if you are not near so I don't
I don't, I don't

[Verse]
Everyday every way it's all the same
Everyday every way you blow me away
Don't you know that you are everything to me my love?
You are everything, you are everything
You are everything I have ever dreamed
You are everything
You are everything I have ever dreamed
You are everything
You are everything to me
So please won't you please believe
You are the one that I dream about
Close my eyes and see you on a cloud
You are the one that I dream about
Close my eyes and see you on a cloud
