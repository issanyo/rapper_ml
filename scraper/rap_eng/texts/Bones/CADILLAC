[Hook]
I'm in my Cadillac swinging on twenty fours
I've got the tape deck loud and the block on froze
I'm in my Cadillac feeling like its '94, money come money go but the memories are
The only things that you'll need
The only feelings that you'll feel
When you riding down that road, with all of the windows down
I'm in my Cadillac swinging on twenty fours
I've got the tape deck loud and the block on froze
I'm in my Cadillac feeling like its '94, money come money go but the memories are

[Verse]
Ok, I'm ridin' round in that Cadillac
Mr. Magic that rap attack
I been rappin' since the fuckin' age of 6, I been fuckin' the game y'all can have it back
Blunt smoke in my habitat, hit it once and then pass it back
Them flashbacks keep flashin' back like flashlights playin' flash tag
Ash that then I kick that, shit off the richter
I been in this rap game, flow feel like December
That bass in your system, that snare, and that kick-drum
That feelin' you get when you got the top down bumpin' this song

[Hook]
I'm in my Cadillac swinging on twenty fours
I've got the tape deck loud and the block on froze
I'm in my Cadillac feeling like its '94, money come money go but the memories are
The only things that you'll need
The only feelings that you'll feel
When you riding down that road, with all of the windows down

[Outro]
I'm in my Cadillac
I'm in my Cadillac
I'm in my Cadillac
I'm in my Cadillac
I'm in my Cadillac
