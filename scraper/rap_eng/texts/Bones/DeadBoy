[Hook: Bones]
I'm just a dead boy, got no blood in my veins
I'm just a dead boy, just so stuck in my ways
I'm just a dead boy, I got no blood in my veins
I'm just a dead boy, just so stuck in my ways

[Verse 1: Bones]
You say you banging like Marvin, Gaye's father, be honest
You acting hard, sellin' dope, like I ain't got enough on me
Say you strapped like the army, claim you spraying the Tommy
I'm just a corpse on the porch, there's no way you can harm me
See I already passed, now I'm in a better place
With a fountain and some pillars and my girl to feed me grapes
If you thinking death is bad, let me tell you that it's great
Come and pay me a visit, I'm in the grave by the lake

[Hook: Bones]
I'm just a dead boy, got no blood in my veins
I'm just a dead boy, just so stuck in my ways
I'm just a dead boy, I got no blood in my veins
I'm just a dead boy, just so stuck in my ways

[Verse 2: Bones]
Young Kevin Nash, just a victim of this cash
If the money make us choose, just make sure we make it back
Just make sure we make it flip, just make sure we make it last
Flow, roll, smoke, breathe, speak, creep and make it stack
Now she dead on the floor, now I'm ready to go
See, I don't like a bitch if she like Anna Nicole
Fubu on my velour, it's the prince of the sewers
See, it's the lord of the rats, no shirt, no shoes
What?

[Outro: Bones]
I'm just a dead boy, got no blood in my veins
I'm just a dead boy, just so stuck in my ways
I'm just a dead boy, I got no blood in my veins
I'm just a dead boy, just so stuck in my ways
