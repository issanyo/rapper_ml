[Verse]
What do you mean, yeah
What do you mean, yeah
What do you mean, yeah, yeah
Rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Forever goin' goin' goin' goin'
I could never stop for nothin' oh no
Sittin' in the back i'm smokin' oh no
Same old shit its the same old Bones
Creepin' up behind with the same old flow

[Outro]
You know
I got this shit
I got this shit
You got nothing
