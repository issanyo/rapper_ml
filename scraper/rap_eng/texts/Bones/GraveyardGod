[Hook: Bones]
It's the Graveyard God (God)
It's the Graveyard God (God) (what?)
Comin' down hard (hard)
Creepin' up the boulevard (vard)
It's the Graveyard God (ah)
It's the Graveyard God (God) (what?)
All my friends dead, all my dreams on the floor (what?)

[Verse 1: Bones]
It's the teenage skeleton (ah)
Flask full of medicine (ah)
Smoking in the cemetery, welcome to my residence (what?)
Everything dies in the end (in the end)
So I'm up trying to do just what I can (what I can)
Everybody know my name (name)
Everybody know my blade (blade)
Slyhterin' through the streets
Comin' through with that wave (wave)
Manson Marylin (what?)
Bitches on heroin (what?)
Watch them overdose, I ain't worried, they can handle it
(BONES)

Creepin' up the boulevard (vard)

It's the Graveyard God (SESH)
All my friends dead, all my dreams on the floor (what?)
