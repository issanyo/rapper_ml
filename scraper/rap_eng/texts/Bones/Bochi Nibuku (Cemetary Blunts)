[Verse 1: Bones]
Got a pack full of wraps and a whole lot of dope to roll tonight (night)
I'mma take your bitch back to the back of the Cadillac, let me hold her tight (tight)
All the windows down, riding 'round on your side of town
Tray full of that blunt ash, got a trunk stuffed with them fucking pounds
Riding 'round, riding 'round
Rain falling, it's coming down
Pinky ring go bling-bling but my switchblade don't make a sound
I'm swervin', just servin'
These bitches call like it's urgent
Your girl say that she nervous
So she popped a pill now she twerkin'
She bad, and I'm good
Find me swangin' around my hood
Rolling Backwoods, back to back, don't get it misunderstood
She bad, and I'm good
Find me swangin' around my hood
Rolling Backwoods, back to back, don't get it (waah) misunderstood

[Hook: Ethelwulf]
I'm rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'
I'm rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'
I'm rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'
I'm rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'
I'm rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'
I'm rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'
I'm rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'
(Waaaaah)
I'm rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'

[Verse 2: Ethelwulf]
I'm sitting in a chair rolling up some weed
I don't give a fuck about what you need
All I care about is me and me, and my W.E.E.D
Come fuck with me but don't fuck with me
If you touch me I'll turn ugly
And if she ugly, then she ain't with me
I'mma keep it real till I D.I.E
I'm posted with the Bones, carcasses around my home
Mane I like to be alone, I'm too rare to be a clone
I ain't human nigga, move on
Before I remix your dome
Airplane mode stay on my phone, bitch I won't never answer my phone
Bitch

[Hook: Ethelwulf]
I'm rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'
I'm rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'
I'm rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'
I'm rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'
I'm rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'
I'm rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'
I'm rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin'
I'm rollin' and smokin' and smokin' and rollin', bitch

[Outro: Bones]
It's 420
She bad, and I'm good
Find me swangin' around my hood
Rolling Backwoods, back to back, don't get it misunderstood
She bad, and I'm good
Find me swangin' around my hood
Rolling Backwoods, back to back, don't get it misunderstood
