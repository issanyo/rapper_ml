[Verse 1: Xavier Wulf]
I made a note to myself to keep smokin' and never stop
Am I a bad person cause I don't give a fuck a lot
My girl know I lie, how the fuck am I 'sposed to stop
Hoes on my dick from right here down the damn block
I'mma keep it real i flip but i never flop
Seventy seven dollars on a hunna come holla back
I know you got some weed, give it all to the hoe in back
Nigga fuck you mean, you know I need all of that
Zanpakto on yo hoe can you handle that
Hell to the nah weak nigga go runnin back
Im sittin' in a cave with a rave goin in the back
Ain't nobody hear it but myself and the blood splatter
I don't give a fuck cause nothin' doesn't matter
I'm on LSD, all I hear is a bitch laughin'
Nigga find me in an acid casket (in an acid casket)

[Verse 2: Bones]
Ridin' all alone, I ain't never goin' home
Stayin' right here, I ain't got nowhere to go
I don't got a phone good luck trynna call
Backwoods gettin' rolled and the sky gets dark
Clouds roll in, find it hard to stop the pain
Trynna go Backside, trynna stop the rain
Flashbacks play everytime I hear your name
Wake up from a dream, hundred blunts to the face
Now I'm ridin' slow, back to the place that I already go
Now I'm ridin' slow, boys don't know but your girl know it's Bones
