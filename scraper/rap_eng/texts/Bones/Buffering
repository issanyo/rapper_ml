[Verse]
Woods low, now we need some more
Got some dope but we got nothin' to roll
Hit the door like let's go hit the store
Hit the store, let's go hit the store
And get a light, need to smoke before the flight
Road life, different region every night
Cities change quicker, this weathers got me shiverin'
Got on the flight with a jacket
Hop off, gotta take it off cuz this heat is sweltering
SESH on my chest 'till I turn into dust
100 blunts in my lungs before the moon replace the sun

[Outro]
Night time rolling with the windows down
Night time rolling with the windows down
What?
SESH
