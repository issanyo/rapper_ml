[Intro]
What?
SESH

[Verse 1: Bones]
Aye, sippin' water from the creek
Fruit up on the trees, rolling blunts underneath
Let the leaves be my sheets
I got everything I need, blade always within reach
Now I'm speaking to the breeze while I smoke
Wind whisper in my ear while I flow
See the light hit the grave, then I turned into a slave
All I gotta do is SESH till I'm back where I came
Wait, she said she like just how I do it
Hanging out the roof of that blueberry Buick
Raspberry seeds with the Matte black rims
This is Matt don't smoke, I never pass that shit

[Verse 2: Na$ty Matt]
Waken from the deep sleep, sun beaming through the leaves
Soon as I open my eyes, I'm on the creek
Pick up the machete, night weather turned to coke
Middle of the woods where I found my soul
Aye, I don't need nobody else
If I need any help, pull the blade off the shelf
Motherfuckers going missing around here
Scream as loud as you want, it won't hit nobody's ear
She love way I creep, hopping off the priest
Four deep, Mac-10's and gold teeth
No [?] nothing
Me and Bones with suppressors riding together in the compressor
