[Verse]
Everybody I know, okay
Hate me to the core, okay
It's okay, I feel the same
One day I will go away
Permanently
Permanently
I hope you're all happy when I'm gone

Everybody I know, okay
Hate me to the core, okay
It's okay, I feel the same
One day I will go away
Permanently
Permanently
I hope you're all happy when I'm gone

Everybody I know, okay
Hate me to the core, okay
It's okay, I feel the same
One day I will go away
Permanently
Permanently
I hope you're all happy when I'm gone

Everybody I know, okay
Hate me to the core, okay
It's okay, I feel the same
One day I will go away
Permanently
Permanently
I hope you're all happy when I'm gone
