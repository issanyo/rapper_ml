[Intro: GRANDMILLY]
Grand, Grandmilly in this, bitch
Th@ Kid in this, bitch
TeamSesh nigga
275 in this hoe
And you already know

[Verse 1: GRANDMILLY]
Friday the 13th, Halloween
Got me commit me a murder scene
Grabbin' that strap I don't know how to act
If that gat is not packed then I'm blowin' that MAC
Pull up beside of ya ride that tool
[?]
Psycho mentality, losin' my gravity, fight all my life I can't face my reality
Murder in the first degree, yo body turn to missing, G
Shootouts in the park, all after dark won't solve no mysteries
Give her the evidence first
Fuck with my Raiders you lay in the dirt
Runnin' from the police, niggas don't know me, Cadillac pimp when a nigga on a slow creep
Bustas get mad but they not strapped
This that Three 6 Project Pat
Schoolin' my young blood to this game
Lords of The Underground bringin' the pain
Hammer cocked up in my ride
Tryna get brain
From yo slide
She a hoe
And she blow
Whatchu think that I ain't know
This is for all of my niggas that's pullin' them triggers
And be bought they business as lord as my witness
I'm witnessing killers, bodies on couches with blood on the ceiling
None to the fucks think I'm losin' my feelin'
Killas is with me they ready and willin'
Run into Crips and I'm ready to kill'em
Look in the mirror that bitch is a villain
Nigga

[Chorus: Bones]
Friday the 13th
It's the 13th
Friday the 13th
It's the 13th
Friday the 13th
It's the 13th
Friday the 13th
It's the 13th

[Verse 2: Bones]
Mask cover my face
Feelin' something like Kane
I chokeslam, I piledrive, I'm X-Pac when I spray
I'm JFK with that K
Headshots all day
When the block gets hot, see the Glock is cocked, and that MAC-10 stay laid
On my lap, in the lac, coming down, slangin' packs
Bring it back, bring it back, to the bottom of the map
In the kitchen with the crack, on the stove top boilin'
Deuces in the trunk, Bobby Johnson when I'm ridin'
I've been, livin', smoking these blunts and thinking
That I need to get this money, so it's raps that I've been kicking
Lincoln navigator, Interior alligator
TV screen Playstation SEGA, everything your bitch ever dreamed of
Bitch it's me and Grandmilly in the drop-top lac blowin' smoke to the breeze
Tangueray cups with the O to the E
Cadillac pimpin' with the gold on my teeth (Wha?)
Whatchu mad for bitch tryna keep my lines clear, call me back when you finish, it...

[Outro: Bones]
Friday the 13th
It's the 13th
Friday the 13th
It's the 13th
Friday the 13th
It's the 13th
(Friday the 13th)
(It's the 13th)
(SESH, bitch)
