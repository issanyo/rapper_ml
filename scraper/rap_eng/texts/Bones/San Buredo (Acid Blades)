[Verse 1: Xavier Wulf]
Let me tell you how I feel
When I'm out in the field
And all these niggas feel like
I don't even feel I just wanna fuckin kill
And they already know so I'm tryna keep low
But they keep making me mad
I'ma come to the fuckin surface with a god damn katana
Cause I'm the katana man
And I'm on LSD. acid blades on me
Fuck with me I'll cut you up
I don't give a fuck
Better ask a nigga about me
Better get your ass on Google and fuckin search me
Better get your ass on Wikipedia and learn bout' me
Better get your ass, away from me (waaah)
Better keep your fuckin' bitch at a distance (at a distance)
Cause I will fuckin' slap her ass with the quickness (with the quickness, ahhh)
