[Verse 1]
When the birds fly south and the snow come down and the crops all die
Bitch I'm outside, rolling these bones now Bones be high
If I ever go broke like I was last year, I'm not even gon' lie
Bitch I might ride, bitch I might steal, bitch you might die
Browning logo, moving slow mo
Cohoctah Woods but I'm still in NoHo
Eyes like GoPros, I catch the low low
I see what you don't, I know what you don't
Ghillie suits now, lined with goose down
Skeptic critics say that I'm the proof now
Hope they hate me, I really mean that
Change the game, bitch, who brought the scene back?
Let the fans down, I picked the fans up
Looking bend down, we got our bands up
Everything is just like I'm dreaming
If you ain't, you bitch, you ain't leaving
You ain't breathing, we ain't teasing
Always dropping, never take a breather
Showing up is just conceding
They wanna be us, they wanna be us but they can't
Could ride in Beamers but we ride in vans
Wanna see us, they surround the van
But the window tint make sure they can't
I'm just tryna get home safe
Roll me up a big ol' 8
I'm just tryna get home safe
Roll me up a big ol' 8
Feeling something like Joni Mitchell
I've seen some shit and speak on the issue
You live in hand but you talking pistol
Tell me how the fuck that work when they come with missiles?
They banging now, you laying down
Spraying rounds so you praying now
Don't be barking if you ain't gon' bite
'Cause we all know people that will tonight
