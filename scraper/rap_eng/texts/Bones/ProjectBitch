[Verse]
I'm in the projects, bitch
Bumpin' Project Bitch
See my chain tucked in
I'm never flauntin' shit
See I'm dopin' slowly
See I'm smokin', chokin'
I've been rollin', hopin'
That I live just to see my own kids
That I'm there on the day that they drivin'
That they're there on the night that I'm dyin'
No tears, tell em stop that cryin'
Lived a life full of gold and diamonds
See in my grave all i hear is silence
See in my days all i saw was violence
Gunshots when i shut my eyelids
In the A.M. wake to the sirens
It's a tragedy, when i watch the world it's just sad to me
It's like watching the death of a masterpiece
Can't do a thing just gotta watch it bleed
Just gotta watch it bleed
Can't do a thing just gotta watch it bleed
Watching the earth it's so sad to me
It's like watching the death of a masterpiece
