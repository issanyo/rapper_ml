[Intro]
Drip, Bones, SESH

[Verse]
Fuck a dollar, fuck paper
Bitch I’m at your door time to meet yo maker
You are looking at the reaper in the making
All you look is soft all for the takin'
Pussies be actin like kids, stop
Yelling while I’m riding till the rims stop
Hop out, SESH on the block now
Long hair with the fire lets rock now
101 down, 101 to go
I-75 with the heat, still cold
Always down to ride while you stay home
Whole game on my dick, never gettin' off
Shit never gets old, bet your shit on iTunes never get sold
I stay in the caves, razorblades growin mold
I'll tell you where I’m at if you ever feel bold
Slide I'll be waiting all night
Take your chain and your life put em both on ice
(What?)
Keep bragging bout ya price
Keep sayin I do to a deal, I'll throw the rice
I'll be waiting all night
Take your chain and your life put em both on ice
(SESH)
Keep bragging bout ya price
Keep sayin I do to a deal, I'll throw the rice

[Hook]
Bad thoughts from me to you
Times three like beetle juice
I stick to my roots
You stray far from the truth
Bad thoughts from me to you
Times three like beetle juice
I stick to my roots
You stray far from the truth
What?
