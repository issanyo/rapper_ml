[Verse]
When it's cold, baby, I'll keep you warm
The temperature low, well let me turn the heat on
Rain with the snow, wood for the smoke
Wind let it blow just like we in our own world
I gotta know I said "I'd like to know, are you okay?"
And I lie awake 'till I find a way to make it all alright
When it's cold, baby, I'll keep you warm
The temperature low, well let me turn the heat on
Rain with the snow, wood for the smoke
Wind let it blow just like we in our own world
I gotta know I said "I'd like to know, are you okay?"

[Outro]
Dead of the night, wake up and I'm so concerned
I dont know why I just lie right back down and go to sleep
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep

[Post-Outro: James Taylor]
It woke me up on a Sunday, an hour before the sun
