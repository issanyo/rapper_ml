[Intro]
I know..
threat has been detected

[Verse]
Maybe when everything collapses we will notice
Maybe we should have worked harder
To love each other and focus
On all the problems at hand
Instead of looking at each other
This shit will never just happen now I'm afraid it's over
People have been here for way too long
For us to still not know how to fucking get along
They say that they have been trying for way too long
I'm in a place I cannot say I condone the actions of we fall to pieces (we fall to pieces)
A million fucking people die a day and they don't make the news
I guess prioritizing death is something that's cool
A million fucking reasons why I hate the places that I'm at
Because I did not choose to be here and that's a fact
We fall to pieces (we fall to pieces)

[Outro (Reversed)]
As we go further down the trail together, we will realize this is the only safe place for us.
