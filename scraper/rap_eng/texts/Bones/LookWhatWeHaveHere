[Chorus]
Sicker than me, doubt that (Doubt that)
Grippin' that heat, huh fall back (Fall back)
Say that you fuck and don't call back (Call back)
You full of shit need to drop that (Drop that)
Sicker than me, doubt that  (Doubt that)
Grippin' that heat, I'll fall back (Fall back)
Say that you fuck and don't call back (Call back)
You full of shit need to drop that (Drop that)

[Verse]
Slappin' the clip in the MP
40 I rip till it's empty
24 feelin' like 43
Did 10 years of work but in 1 week
Built for the dirt like a Humvee
Used to the hurt like it nothing
Acting like you be on something
Key word is acting, you bluffing
Cut, what
Take you a year only take me a month
Stop, drop
Set fire to your life watch your ass go up
Shine, glisten
Diamonds they spoiled they always be bitchin'
I never fit in
Came down so hard I created a fissure
