[Verse]
I could have been a lawyer, I could have been a doctor
But I don't give a fuck about helpin' out others
You act like you be snappin', you say that you're the hardest
But you don't fool nobody, you're a pussy like your father
A bitch just like your mom, a wreck just like your home
I know you feel alone, so know I will not go
I know you feel alone, I know you feel me here
I'm sittin' right beside you, everything is okay
