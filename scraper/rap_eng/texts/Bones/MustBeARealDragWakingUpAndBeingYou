[Intro]
Okay, you get money, okay, you fuck bitches
Okay, you get higher than...

[Verse]
Okay, you get money, okay, you fuck bitches
Okay, you get higher than anyone living
Okay, you be sipping, suppressants, you mix 'em
Prescriptions, you need 'em like breathing, I get it
You cooler than who be the coolest and more
But Bones got something that you need to know
You are the same as everyone out
Only the weak take the popular route
Feel like you popping 'til we come around
Get a big head when they bumping your sound
Think you untouchable up until now
Skeleton touch will make you turn around
Vanish now, where do you think I am now?
Evaporate, rise up turn into a cloud
Never seen you when the rain coming down
I touch every drop before it touches the ground

[Hook]
I'm real, J. Lo, Ja Rule
They don't do it like I do
I'm real, J. Lo, Ja Rule
They don't do it like I do

[Outro: Skit]
Check it out guys, it's your man
Burning the voicebox in the fucking underground and we're back here
You know what I mean, I can't wait to fucking wrap my hands on this new Bones project called Unrendered
You already know man, straight from the fucking underground, you know what I mean?
You know, every now and then he drops that singing pussy shit but we can get past that as long as he keeps dropping those bangers
(Yo, if you're listening to this Bones, stop with the pussy shit)
Aye man, keep dropping those fucking bangers and we're gonna keep showing up man, know what I mean? Gotta give us that real shit, dawg
But anyways... (That fucking skinny white pimp, man)
Hell yeah
