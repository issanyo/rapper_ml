[Hook: Fifty Grand]
All right, I tell 'em cause I'm alright
You know you've got me all, right? All right
All right, I tell 'em cause I'm alright
You know you've got me all, right? All right

[Verse 1: Bones]
If I had one wish, you would be it
If I could hear a song for forever, you would sing it
I've got problems I know, I promise that I'll solve them
The burden of your worries are too much for me to swallow
I'm worthless, don't know what's my purpose
I thought it was you but all I seem to do is hurt you
I want to disappear, I want to leave forever
You shade me from the sun, you hide me from the weather
I'm worthless, don't know what's my purpose
I thought it was you but all I seem to do is hurt you
I want to disappear, I want to leave forever
You shade me from the sun, you hide me from the weather

[Hook: Fifty Grand]
All right, I tell 'em cause I'm alright
You know you've got me all, right? All right
All right, I tell 'em cause I'm alright
You know you've got me all, right? All right
Alright
