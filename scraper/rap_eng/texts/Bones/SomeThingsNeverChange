[Verse]
What?
Oooh
Still in the dark where the light don't go
Oooh
Don't ask me how I'm doing, promise you don't wanna know
You have changed you are not the same as before
I can see it in your eyes right when you walk through the door
Winds pickin' up, I see the clouds starting to form
When I'm sitting with you I am in the eye of the storm

[Outro]
I can feel it, anyone could feel it
No it doesn't take a genius
I can feel it, anyone could feel it
No it doesn't take a genius
To know that something's wrong
I just wanna talk
To know that something's wrong
I just wanna talk
SESH, what?
