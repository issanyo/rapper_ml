[Verse 1]
Smart-house mansion
Japanese lanterns
Bath house, bathing
When I'm feeling anxious
Gotta be patient, jumping guns dangerous
Boom goes the bass, and it's shaking the paintings
Life is a vacation, fine wine tasting
Never see me change, only re-arranging
Nothing's what I'm claiming
Something's what I'm gaining
Woke from a dream, to a sight so amazing
Studio basement, writing in the attic
Dave in the kitchen, cooking up something lavish
Money in the mattress, gold in the safe
No I never go to banks, cause I don't feel safe
No brand names, young hand me down veins
Wear my father's old watch
With my grandfather's ring
Feel like a king, but I'm looking like a prince
Cause I'm young and I'm gorgeous
The life of a pimp
Rose water tea, fresh honey from the house
Strawberries from the garden
Never shop, never buy
I ain't buying what you selling
You just lying, you a felon
And I'm a nice you fellow when the volume on eleven
Jaguar in the the driveway, the '98 model (Vroom)
Yellow Testarossa when I need the full throttle
Motherfuck a bottle, water in my chalice
Wonderland blunts, with a girl like Alice

[Hook]
Yeah, my feet up in my palace
Everything golden, everything lavish
Living life so lavish (lavish, lavish)(x2)
