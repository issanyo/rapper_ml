[Verse]
On the road I don't know what I'm chasing (chasing)
All I know is I'ma go 'till I'm ancient (ancient)
I remember cold nights in the basement (basement)
Synthetic drugs, fake friends, Howell ain't shit (ain't)
Writing messages begging for a placement (place)
If I don't fuck with you then you just need to face it (face)
'Fore 19 minus 5 I'ma face it (face it)
Way too cashed get off my line with that fake shit (ah)
They pretend and I can tell by who they hang with
You are a reflection of the trash that you stay with (stay with)
You can press me for my life I won't say shit (say shit)
Bitch, for my team, watch me die like life ain't shit (what)
There I go, there I go slamming caddie doors
You stay with hoes for you no sympathy inside these bones (ah)
Like dismissing [?] trying to evolve
You always move without your heart, you need money and fall

[Outro]
Fall, fall, you gone fall off
Fall, fall, you gone fall off
Fall, fall, you gone fall off
Fall, fall, you gone fall off
What, yeah, SESH
