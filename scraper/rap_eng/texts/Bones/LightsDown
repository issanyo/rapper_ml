[Verse 1]
I don't need no money, I don't need no cars
I don't no bitches, like I'm a fucking star
But when you acting hard, you know you fucking not
I've been around your block, been up in your girls spot
Bitch, she telling me all the shit that she'll never tell you
She been telling me all the ways that I'm better than you
Stop playing, I'm the man and you know that it's true
In ger dreams she getting fucked but you know, It's not you

[Hook]
Windows closed, give up the flow
She likes to go fast, I'm fuck her slow
People always ask how I got so sick
I tell 'em "ditch school, do drugs and never trust a bitch"

[Verse 2]
Underage and I'm underpaid
The best rapper, thats an understay
Meant to make, I wasn't meant to make
I fucking pop pimp, while you fucking fake
Your girlfriend, she like me
You best believe, I don't like her back
She wanna fuck, I'm just trying to lax
While she trying to ride my cadillac

[Outro]
The lights down, the team up
All we do is sesh, all we roll is blunts
The lights down, the team up
All we do is sesh, all we roll is blunts
