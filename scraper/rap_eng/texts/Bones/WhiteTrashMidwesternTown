[Verse 1: Bones]
You used to say, when I was down
There's more to life outside this, white trash midwestern town
You birthed the spark in my brain
Said it'd be sunny, but that night it rained
Wet shoes as I stepped on the plane
Found my seat and closed the window shade
I fell asleep and then awoke to a shake
I overheard like they spoke my name
The captain said, "It'll be a task to make it
To LAX with a storm like this
We'll try our best," he said with a nervous grin
You could hear the breath, you could see the face
Of a man who'd cut the tension if his hands didn't shake
He's got a wife, two girls, and a home on the ground
And the most disturbing part is they don't know it's going down
The most disturbing part is they don't know it's going down
The most disturbing part is they don't know it's going down

[Chorus: Maximilian Hecker]
I'll paint the sky you're flying
Tired of the Earth of lying
Lowering my eyes to see you
Telling all the lies to be with you

[Verse 2: Bones]
But not in the fire and not in the crash
The weather, the storm, you say will land intact
It's when he goes home that it becomes real
There's a small part of him that resents the wheels
He hates the wings and the bolts that hold them
Together like promises they never told him
He thinks they deserve the same life that he had
He wished the fucking engine would've blown to pieces
