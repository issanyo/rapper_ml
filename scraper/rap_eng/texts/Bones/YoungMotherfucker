[Hook]
Somethin' bout that gold chain
Somethin' bout that white skin
Somethin' bout that pimp named Bones
Got 'em feelin' a little frightened
Somethin' bout that gold chain
Somethin' bout that white skin
Somethin' bout that pimp named Bones
Got 'em feelin' a little frightened
Somethin' bout that gold chain
Somethin' bout that white skin
Somethin' bout that pimp named Bones
Got 'em feelin' a little frightened

[Verse]
Young motherfucker with the old ass flow
Lemme take y'all back to the nine nine four
On the lime line phone
Y'all love on hoes, finna pick up a Swisher
In a whole brand new zone
Got a brand new flow, and my old hand me downs on
On my throne, with my motherfuckin' crown on
Val Venis, nothin' but my towel on
Hair slick back, Uncle Jesse with my prowl on
Bass get to pound on, ridin' with my team
I could die tonight, so before I leave
Just know that I'm here for one reason only
Let my voice bang loud, while you Swisher rolling
I'm out, but let me roll that shit
Takin' way too long, lemme hold that shit
Got veins full of dope, skin same color as coke
But my mind pitch black, like nobody home
Home of the great young pimp named Bones
Bow to the legend, for he might be gone
Everybody act like they know what's cool
All I gotta do is hit the jukebox, and boom
Lookin' like Fonzie, feelin' like Shawn
I'm in the summer with my shirt off stuntin'
I got the whole block jumpin', it's like a criss-cross concert
Say, fuck your concert, fuck your sponsor

[Hook]
Somethin' bout that gold chain
Somethin' bout that white skin
Somethin' bout that pimp named Bones
Got 'em feelin' a little frightened
Somethin' bout that gold chain
Somethin' bout that white skin
Somethin' bout that pimp named Bones
Got 'em feelin' a little frightened
Somethin' bout that gold chain
Somethin' bout that white skin
Somethin' bout that pimp named Bones
Got 'em feelin' a little frightened

[Outro]
Blunts, I roll 'em
Sippin' tanqueray, no soda
See I'm too young to be sober
That's Team SESH till it's over
