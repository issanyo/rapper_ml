[Verse: Bones]
Bones
Working on ya crap 'til the casket
Roll shine like a man who never drops shit
And that's fine, if you've got some other ways
To get it, truly hope you do, cause any fucking day
We could wake up from this shitty dream to [?] ways
And hazy city scenes
Let it all fade away
Clouds dissolve into another scene with a better frame
Oversaturation's something I wish to achieve
But no matter what I do
They still fuck with me
Tryna be transparent
Rather have you just see through me
I'm not built to see the payoff from the shit they call 'music'
It's funny and it's amusing with the undertone of
Madness

[Outro]
Nowadays it's funny cause of the kids with fake sadness
But there's really nothing fun about being stuck in a room for a hundred days and a hundred nights wishing that you could relate to the people outside
