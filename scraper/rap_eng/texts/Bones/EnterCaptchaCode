Welcome back, Bones

[Verse]
Iced out skull heads, '06 Juelz
Runnin when I'm comin like oh shit the 12
Said I'd never be where I'm at right now
See a wall first thing I say is stand back, pow
You fucked up now I been fucked up forever
Head full of spiders shake and watch em' all scatter
Proof is in the pudding we know how to mix the batter
Try to replicate the recipe and ruin every platter
Coming through move out I know what you do now
Wake up hate me act like you cool now
When you talk shit just watch who you cool around
Dirty how your crew will be when there is not a "you" around
And that's just facts and if you don't like that
And that's just facts and if you don't like that

[Hook]
You can see me bout it
You can see me if you wanna talk about it
You can see me bout it
You can see me if you wanna talk about it

[Outro]
System update complete
Thank you
