[Verse]
Bills so crispy bitch I'm countin' Kia Shines
Cover my girl in red stones just so I can see her shine
Bitch they callin' up my lines but I ain't pickin' up
These labels want me, they know I don't want 'em but don't give it up
Digits up in the millions, but I ain't finished school so
All it's really lookin' like is regress I never choose
I don't need no ones money
I don't need no ones love
I don't need to feel the rush of turning heads at the club
And I don't go to clubs bitch, so motherfuck a club
But I know they probably book me at the last place I would

[Hook]
48's flatter than some paper plates
SESH thinner than the trails in the ice when you skate
48's flatter than some paper plates
SESH thinner than the trails in the ice when you skate
48's flatter than some paper plates

[Outro]
"Paper plates are pretty common, right Johnny? You see them around all over the place. Well, they're the perfect shape to make a very interesting object of illusion. Watch carefully what I do, just the rim left."
