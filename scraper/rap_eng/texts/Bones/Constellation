[Verse]
Night sky
Night time
Night's wine
Why you lyin' like you dyin' when you lookin' like you fine
See my white skin shinin', Bones might blind you
But take Bones' hand baby let Bones guide you
Searchin' I can find it
Examinate and [?] it
Open up her eyelids, she say it's like diamonds
Impeccable my timin'
On the prophet island
Used to hear violence, but now I hear violins
Granite on the counters, never had allowance
Little bit of money in my sock now I'm loungin'
Speakers stay poundin', walls stay bouncin'
Lungs stay full new day new ounces

[Hook]
Overthinkin' my situation every day I'm patient
They say they stars so if so I am the constellation
Overthinkin' my situation every day I'm patient
They say they stars so if so I am the constellation
