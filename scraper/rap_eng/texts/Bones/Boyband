[Intro: INOJ]
It never really mattered to much to me
That you were just too damned old for me
It never really mattered to much to me
That you were just too damned old for me

[Verse: Bones]
It never really mattered too much to me
But I know that deep inside you still miss laying next to me
It never really mattered too much to me
But I know that deep inside I still miss laying next to you
It never really mattered too much to me
But I hope you know you mean more than life to me
It never really mattered too much to me
But I know that deep inside you still miss laying next to me

[Outro: INOJ]
It never really mattered to much to me
