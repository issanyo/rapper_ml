[Verse]
Four bars, Mac fully charged
Young DSL, it's the Wi-Fi lord
Network browsing, PayPal piling
Bones get violent and leave when itâ€™s silent
3D textures, HD flexing
My keyboard shine like the modem when it's blinking
I'm only thinking that we should get away
URL blunts to my IRL face
Upload, download, baby if you down for
Me, like the Dow Jones, hold me like a dial tone
Upload, download, baby if you down for
Me, like the Dow Jones, hold me like a dial tone

[Hook]
Hello, hello, pick up the phone, bitch
Hello, hello, pick up the phone, bitch
Hello, hello, pick up the phone, bitch
Hello, hello, pick up the phone, bitch
