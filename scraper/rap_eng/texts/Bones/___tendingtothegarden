[Verse]
New day, breeze sweetly
Spinning around my head, spinning around my head
Heavy skies, soft lies
Leave me so unenthused, under the deepest blue

New day, breeze sweetly
Spinning around my head, spinning around my head
Paper skin, water eyes
I cannot see a thing, please wait up for me

[Hook]
First try is never the best one
Everything we touch now turns to stone

First try is never the best one
Everything we touch now turns to stone
