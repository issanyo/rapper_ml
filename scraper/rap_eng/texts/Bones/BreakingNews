[Hook]
This land is your land
This land is my land
From California
To the New York islands
From the river forest
To the Gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me

[Verse 1]
Wake up in the morning yawning
Grab a towel and I hit the shower
I'm stretching, pausing, thinking
"Why only 60 minutes in a hour?"
"Why only 24 in a day?"
"Why 365 a year?"
'Cuz I know I didn't choose that shit
That shit was chose before I was here
Think it's your land all you want
Know the reason they blasting guns
If you want food then you need the funds
They don't run around banging for fucking fun
Fuck being white, I'm nothin'
You say you balling, you stuntin'
See I ain't throwing money
Bitch that's like throwing me
Only reason's we dying
You live your life inside the last
Go to school, go to work then die
Believe in a god, never wonder why
Never think about space, never think about time
My heart's beating too fast
Tryna catch my breath but I can't
Wake up as soon as I see the sun
'Cuz wasting seconds, I can
'Cuz death's around every corner
While you're worried about that mortgage
I'm smiling ear to ear
While you slipping bitch and you falling
I say motherfuck your dollars
I say motherfuck your college
I say motherfuck every year you waste
Thinking that you're gainin' that knowledge

[Hook]
This land ain't your land
This land ain't my land
See brother's dying
See mother's crying
From the burning forest
To the poisoined waters
This land was made for you and me
