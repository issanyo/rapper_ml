[Verse 1: Bones]
What?
Tell me where to go (go)
I just need to know (know)
Even in a crowded room I still feel alone (what?)
Save me from this nightmare
I can't do it by myself (no)
If I have to die tonight, will you be right here? (here)
Hold my hand to show you love me
If I have to die tonight, will you be right here? (what?)
Holding on until I am outta here
(SESH)

[Hook: Bones]
Baby don't go (go)
Baby don't go (go)
I'm outside of your window, with my radio (what?)
Baby don't go (go)
Baby don't go (go)
I'm outside of your window, with my radio
(SESH)
(What?)
(Bones)
(SESH)
(SESH)
(SESH)
(SESH)
(SESH)

[Outro: Bones]
Tell me where to go (go)
I just need to know (know)
Even in a crowded room I still feel alone (what?)
Save me from this nightmare
I can't do it by myself (no)
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
