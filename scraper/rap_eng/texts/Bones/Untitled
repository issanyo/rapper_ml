(Verse)
Iâ€™m the old photograph that puts the chills in your spine
I'm the sound of your mothers voice saying it's alright
I'm the simplistic beauty like the world when you were five
Everything you know now wanted deleted out your mind
You just wanna go back wanna get away
You try your hardest but your heart is just gon make you stay
Burning dope in the moon light everything your father said
You see is coming true tonight

(Hook) x2
Both eyes closed
Lookin like a work of art chiseled out of stone
I don't wanna go
