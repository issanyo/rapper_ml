[Intro]
SESH, what
SESH

[Verse 1]
Every day, every night
I don't know, what is right
I had to phase it in, you fell from grace
You'll never go, I'm falling off the deep again
The same as those few feel way too well
Never stop, swells just like a welt
Never stop, swells just like a welt
Never stop, swells just like a welt

[Bridge]
Fuck 'em I eject 'em like a VHS
Fuck 'em I eject 'em like a VHS

[Verse 2]
Fuck 'em I eject 'em like a VHS
Weapon on my side
Fuck 'em I eject 'em like a VHS
Weapon on my side
I don't need no help
Better than me? Oh, well
Look down at my feet like "Oh well"
I'ma take my ball and go home
Reflect on my thoughts alone
Regret all the above
I'm trying to get out this rut
It's hard to walk through the mud
I know deep down you don't see nothin' in me
My respiratory system stops whenever you leave
I wish I could turn into a harder me
Cause I know deep down you don't see nothin' in me
What
