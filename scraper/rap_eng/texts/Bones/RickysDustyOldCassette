[Verse 1]
SESH, till there's nothin' of me left, oh yes
Don't hurt your back with all that lifting trying to flex
When I was broke I had to make a quarter stretch
When I was low I would get high to feel less
Now I smoke more to feel myself and feel my best
Always been sensitive but my senses really
Sit well with the fact I can buy more than a pack
Thinking about the times
I used to boil pipes to scrape the glass
Funny to think about the past when you put it in contrast
To the present nothing better
Than to wake in sunny weather
Used to push the snow shovel trapped inside a snow level
Cannot get to me unless you win and no ones ever done it

[Hook]
Take a five (smoke break)
Take a five (smoke break)
Take a five (smoke break)
Take a five (smoke break)
Take a five (smoke break)
Take a five (smoke break)
Take a five (smoke break)
What?

[Verse 2]
Tried to compare us and got embarrassed I would be too
Laundry list of shit you got no room
Look what the team do
Blunts dirty as my room cleaning SESH listening
Self defeated co existence me and rap they got it twisted
One hand never washed the other
I always just kept my distance
Everybody know my friends
I don't keep none of them in secret
If you trying to test the reaper
You get cut out roll re written
I will devote all of my negative energy
To reverse your whole existence
