[Verse]
Some days better than others, yeah I agree
Other days I forget I'm lucky I can breathe
Weird how it works how the wheels they turn
Me to roadkill when I'm hopping off the curb
Misplace words with a distinct verb
Now you feel like you do something for the world
Sorry to say, but we blew that chance
The last of the grains gone, no more sand
Now we stand as the trap door opens
Slowly we fall where eternity closes
We just wanna find a direction to point a finger
And say "it's not mine, it's yours"
Permanent cycle is branded within
From a seed to a tree always know what you is
Support what supports you it's up to you
Do what you want to do
Hopefully, you give back to the roots
Give back to the roots

[Outro]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
I'll never know, no, no
I'll never know, no, no
I'll never know, no, no
I'll never know, no, no
I'll never know, no, no
I'll never know, no, no
I'll never know, no, no
I'll never know, no, no
I'll never know, no, no
I'll never know, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
