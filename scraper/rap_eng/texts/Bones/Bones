[Verse 1: Bones]

Let me tell you a little story
About a pimp named Bones
Always ride with that chrome, never left the chrome at home
See parked up in the parking lot
Pimping all the hoes
Feet hanging out the window
Rolling bones, blowing O's
40 ounces of alcohol in my bottle, bumping juvenile
400 degrees in my Impala
Bitch its 1996, leanin' on that switch
I fucked that ho once, but I ain't called that bitch since
Boy im beating up your block, feel the bass I know you heard me
That skinny white pimp
With that black Glock 30
6'3", gold chain in the jersey
Bitches know its Bones when they see that Chevy swervin'

[Hook]

What?
We just parking lot pimpin'
Parking lot pimpin, bitch
Parking lot pimpin, yeah(x2)

[Verse 2]

He look just like a ghost, when you see him in the night
Skin glowing like stars, every time you hit the light
Tanqueray in my flask
Pile of ash, on the dash
Few more ounces in the glove, rolling blunts till' it's death
They looking at me strange
I tell 'em its just SESH
They ask me what that means
Buncha blunts to the neck
That's the motherfucking team, we don't need your respect
All we need is a beach, a little bit of drugs on the set...
