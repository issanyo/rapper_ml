[Intro: Fin Greenall]
Pen on paper seems so permanent
Every line of
Pen on paper seems so permanent
Every line of

[Verse]
I don't understand at all
Maybe one day you can tell me
That everything I'm feeling is all
Protocol for a being like me
Its all healthy
Don't you worry your tired head
Lay down beside me, rest your eyes, please
We are all better off with rest

[Chorus]
All my life granted
All the sights I've seen
All the sounds I've heard
All the words I've learned
I know nothing on a grander scale
If you still believe in me then we can go
What do you believe in when it's all falling down around you now
You don't have no choice
Sometimes I don't understand
Why I do the things that I do
Sometimes I don't understand
Why I do the things that I do

[Outro: Fin Greenall]
Pen on paper seems so permanent
