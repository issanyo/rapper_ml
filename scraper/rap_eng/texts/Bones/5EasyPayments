[Verse]
What?
The weather's getting cold (cold)
The dope's getting sold (sold)
The block's getting high and this shit's getting old (old)
Skin feeling frozen my feet are feeling numb (numb)
Midwest boy in the blitz of rolling blunts (what?)
Chilling like I'm supposed to
All you boys is old news
Since I dropped out
This ain't old or new school
Doing what I used to
Never let em use you
Thinking 'bout you
And I hope I never lose you (hope I never)

[Hook]
It's 4 AM
Flowing slow, thinking fast
Moonlight shining, blunt ash on my hands (what?)
It's 4 AM
Flowing slow, thinking fast
Moonlight shining, blunt ash on my hands
