[Verse]
Don't say you don't know what I mean
Pressure lingers in the room, I can feel it up in my knees
I feel it when I awake and ignore it until I leave
It's the little things that count and it's the little things I need
If you find the bottled message that I wrote, I hope you read
It's been floating for some time, was assuming you'd never see
Out at sea, it gets lonely in a way that's so unique
Cause you still feel the presence of the waves and the sea
See, I patched up the grate, but I can still see a leak
Goodbye to the world that brought me to my knees
