[Verse]
Let 'em see my face, Bones never ever masked up
Mortgage in my blunt, bitch boy, get your cash up
Did a couple shows, now you think that you could match us
Throw you in the pit, now you never get back up
Back up, back up, bitch, where's your backup?
Wait until your back's got 'fore you start to act up
Say you rap but now you just wrapped up
Roof caving in, let my voice be the backdrop

[Hook]
Why you scared, bitch? Why you looking scared?
Why you scared, bitch? Why you looking scared?
Why you scared, bitch? Why you looking scared?
Why you scared, bitch?
