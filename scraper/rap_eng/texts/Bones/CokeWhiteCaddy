Mask to my fucking face
Mask to my fucking face
With an AK on my fucking hip
Mask to my fucking face
With an AK on my fucking hip
Mask to my fucking face
With an AK on my fucking hip

[Verse 1: Bones]
Young white pimp riding in the whip
Coke white caddy with the all black tint
Gold on his neck, got gold on his wrist
Platinum in his mouth thats the motherfucking kid
He don't need a clique, he just need a clip
He don't need a grip cause he ain't never slip
He don't need a bitch cause all they do is trip
And he don't got time to hear all that shit
Thats Bones and he don't play like that
But if you try to play with him he can play right back
If you try to play dumb, boy you better play guns
Boy you better play hide, boy you better play run
Just a pimp from that 1994
Coming straight from the motherfucking West Coast
Where they all got guns
Use your head or you walk around with none

[Hook]
Ass on my fucking face
With an AK on my fucking hip
Ass on my fucking face
With an AK on my fucking hip
Ass on my fucking face
With an AK on my fucking hip
Ass on my fucking face
With an AK on my fucking hip
