[Verse]
You know I've been hoping and I am dreaming
Throughout the day all through the night
It's another emotion
The difference in knowing
If you're going I'm going too
It's another emotion
The difference in knowing
If you're going I'm going too
If I should fall off the edge of the world
I'd crawl my way back to you
It's another emotion
The difference in knowing
If you're going I'm going too
It's another emotion
The difference in knowing
If you're going I'm going too
If I should fall off the edge of the world
I'd crawl my way back to you
