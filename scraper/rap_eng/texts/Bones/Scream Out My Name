[Hook: Dylan Ross]
All I really ever wanna do is see you locked up in chain
All I really ever wanna do is hear you scream out my name
All I really ever wanna do is show you that we are the same
All I really ever wanna do is see you wanna be released from this pain
(x2)

[Verse 1: Dylan Ross]
We descend into the rabbit hole, fingers intertwined
To Aryu, I just wanna know; can I crawl in your mind? To make you mine has only been a fruitless wish of mine
I am the shadows on the wall and the shivers in your spine
I’ll recite you spells of my people while you sip this wine
And just this time, I might even let you grip this 9
If you listen to the sign you know that’s a cryptic line
I’ll kiss you where you need healing but only if it’s fine
We, could, sink, so, deep, down
We could get lost
If I got lost with you, then I wouldn’t ever wanna be found
I just know that there is
Nobody that could ever replace you
I want you so bad that I could smell you and taste you
These ventricles are not body hearts
They are tunnels which are made for you to explore
I want you to want everything about me, my brain, my lungs, my heart, my face
I want you to want to be trapped in an notion with me, and take pleasure in never wanting to escape

[Verse 2: Bones]
I don’t know, I don’t know
I need you, I need you
You’re lying in my backseat
I’m rolling in the front
I’m sure that I should want more from life but you’re all I want
All I want, All I want baby you are all I want
All I want, All I want baby you are all I want
