[Intro]
Smoking is bad for your health

[Verse]
I'm so ahead of the times
Young daylight savings with a fetish for rhymes
I'm up while you recline
You rise but bitch I shine
I shine like a starry night
Sharper than the end of my knife
I've got a switchblade in my sock
Bikin' up the block
Dope in my system
Checking my mirror for cops
If drugs kill, I am death
No fear, no respect
Sea cress on my white skin
Young Turk with my rhymin'
Father time with my timin'
My timin' so timeless
Your time is, never bitch
My shits forever its classic
So classy but my pocketwatch
Team Sesh written on the top
Scholar shoes never collars pop
Gold cufflinks, young white fuck
I don't kill beats, I surf 'em
My flow, you could never learn it
My earnings, you could never earn 'em
The blunts I smoke man
You could never burn 'em
The team I walk with
You could never run with
Flights so good and the sun so sunny
Fuck a hobby this is life
Since the age of fuckin' 9
Baller blockin' in my headphones
Dollar signs all in my mind
Blame it on Master P for gettin' this flow so nice
