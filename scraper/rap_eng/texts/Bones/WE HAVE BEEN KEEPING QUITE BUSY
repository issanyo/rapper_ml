[Verse]
What did you mean when you said
That if everything falls into place
Life will be safer, no worries
Will slowly dissolve away
But here we have been standing
And all we have seemed to do is wait
I'm starting to feel the radiation
Edit my DNA
I don't know what I'ma do
The thought of it needs you
Sewn together with thread
Promise I'll never leave you
Said to me late last night
It's something that moves you
I will protect you
I will look over you
I promise I'll never lose you

[Outro]
If it were up to me we wouldn't sleep tonight
We would keep on walking to a brand new life
