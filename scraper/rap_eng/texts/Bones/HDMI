[Intro]
SESH

[Verse 1]
Smoking like a motherfucker, higher than a motherfucker
Bitch, please stop the playing
SESHOLLOWATERBOYZ, death to them other boys
We can't hear a word you saying
We don't know your name, can't hang with the gang
Crowd jumping when the bass get banging
All I need is dope, so I gotta get paid
Never see me on the stage unless the money is arranged
My hair 1080, my teeth 240, my blunts 4K
And my dope you couldn't load it
If they ain't calling with a price, we don't answer that
Trying to fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that

[Hook]
If they ain't calling with a price, we don't answer that
Trying to fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that
We gon' handle that bitch, we gon' handle that
Trying to fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that
If they ain't calling with a price, we don't answer that
Trying to fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that
We gon' handle that bitch, we gon' handle that
Trying to fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I'm smoking sacrificial, back to back
Blink, you might miss it
Boy, my team made up of legends
And my ring made out of crystal
They ask me how I been living since these labels out to get me
But the only reason they want to meet me is just to say they fucking met me

[Bridge]
I got money on the table but—
I ain't count it yet
I ain't count it yet
I ain't, I ain't count it yet
Money on the table but—
I ain't count it yet
I ain't count it yet
I ain't, I ain't count it yet

[Outro]
Bones...
