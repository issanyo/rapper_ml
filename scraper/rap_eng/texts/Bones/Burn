[Verse 1 Na$ty Matt]
Headlights in the eyes
Memories passing by
I'm still surprised that I'm still alive
Do you wanna ride with me
Do you wanna die with me
Let it burn [3X]
Let it blaze
Been through too much to have tears on my face
Let it burn [3X]
Let it fade away
Stitch up my pain from yesterday

[Verse 2 Bones]
I'm young but getting old
My death is coming close
I know We got some time
But I just need to know
If you, you down to ride
Then me I'm down to drive
If you, you feel alone
Then me I'm by your side
My blade I let it shine
My name they say it loud
But still I'm on the prowl
I'm creeping through the night
I'm reaching for the knife
If you, you wanna strike
You can not take my life
Because I already died
