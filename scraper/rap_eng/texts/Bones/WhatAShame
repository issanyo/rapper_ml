[Verse 1]
I admit, I emit negativity
Cancel out the positive, replace it with the enemy
I was hopeless back at 17
Till I made a mark, I made it hard to not remember me
Now I'm cashed instead of tweaking, see
We drove 35 minutes, passed Pinckney for the G
If you don't get it, you don't get it
You wasn't there when I was feeding cans into the takers

They only acting like they down when it's beneficial
What a shame, just when you thought it would never change
A couple years later, now they all say your name
Back, back with that I get it, you don't understand a thing
I don't even get it myself, sometimes it's hard for me to
Breathe in
Breathe in
Air full of shit that I cannot pronounce
I don't even know why I'm leaving the house
So I don't, so I stay inside
So I stay inside

[Hook]
Lock the door, throw the key away
Throw the key away
Lock the door, throw the key away
Throw the key away
Lock the door, throw the key away
Throw the key away
Lock the door, throw the key away
Throw the key away
Lock the door, throw the key away
