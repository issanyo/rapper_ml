[Verse 1]
Used to really want it 'till I got it, now I don't want it no more
Feel like I'm frozen, glitchin' and smokin', now I live in slo-mo
I'm the one hurting me
I am not worth a thing to me at least or so it seems
I don't deserve a me

[Hook]
Shut my eyes and see a perfect world
I don't belong, -long, -long
Try my best sometimes but still
Forever wrong, wrong, wrong
Shut my eyes and see a perfect world
I don't belong, -long, -long
Try my best sometimes but still
Forever wrong, wrong, wrong

[Verse 2]
Blunt to my lips, all my people pistol grippin'
Put you on the list only if your ass trippin'
Bitch you ain't livin' you barely getting by
Hopin' every night like I hope life goes alright
You a fuckin' clone, a carbon copy
Around here you get no play, no other option
I'ma put a bomb on you and whoever you ride with
You always said you wanted to blow up, well perfect timing
