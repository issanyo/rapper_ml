[Verse]

Up late in my better way, starin' at my ceiling fan goin' round and round like life on a grander scale
I put it down, you barely put new shit up
21 mixtapes and I ain't even close to done
Ride with the system up, never really gave a fuck
Put a blunt into the atmosphere and watch it burn up
I was 7 in my room with a mic and a boom box
Blocks hot, non stop, rhyme until the sun drops
