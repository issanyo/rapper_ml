[Verse 1]
Yeah
Uh
Look
I kick raps non of that choreographed actin'
My shit slaps, I ain't talkin' limp hand smackin'
I'm closed fist thrashing, catch a hit faster
The [?] Peer Pressure bout Snoop Dogg and crackin'
Feelin good now, big shot ain't ya
Gotcha big boy pants on tryna get famous
But there's just one thing to understand, I stand over you land lovers understand where you stand
You below me, smilin' down on you, laughin' at the distance sound of the raps of fuckin' phonies
When I say, "hold please" you know they be holding
And when I say, "I'm zoning" I'm in another zone, see
The twilight's alright for a zombie, but I got more brains, I don't follow I lead, I got everything I need, this life I see
When I open my eyelids, It's Ipod [?]
Just little old me in some big ol' jeans
Rapping in the mirror while I'm brushin' my teeth
Just 7 years old, with my nice CD's, screamin' "Shoot em up what, shoot em up now bleed"
L-O-V-E for B-E-T-V
I'd wake up early to see the screen
See the countdowns, videos, and hip hop kings, rapping on the [?] with they own gold rings
Like, "how do I get there dad, how do they do it"
"Start rapping young man but if you do you gotta DO IT"
My flows stupid been coming up with new shit
But, hey someone's gotta do this
(It's too good for a hook, I couldn't do that shit...)
