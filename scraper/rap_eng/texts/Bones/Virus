[Verse 1]
Locked in my grave, I ain't slept in days
Worms in my blunt, I got mud up in my veins
Cemetery legend, poppin' like Excedrin
I'm on it smoking heavy, at this rate I'll be high forever
You speakin' like a reverend, then acting like a felon
These conscious rap pussies ain't in no place help us
No position to tell me, how the worship be
Bitch get you some money, get the fuck up off the street

[Verse 2]
Bringing it all the way back, bitch
Sippin' it off my flask, bitch
Creepin' up with that blade
Better bust quick when you see that SESH shit
Wreck shit what I'mma do do, motherfuck your Bentley coupe
Time after time, Cyndi Lauper back in '82
Comin' down clean in a new machine
Drugs on deck and the money on me
Styrofoam cup and I don't sip lean
I just need a place to go but I want my weed
Leave me alone, I just need to fucking breathe
I'm just sick of all these trash every day I fucking see
So I lock the fucking door and keep myself up in the dark
I can see you, I can hear you, I don't even want to start
I don't care about your music, I don't care about your lord
Throw my body in the trash when my time's cut short

[Hook]
And that's for real, real
Don't give a fuck about how you feel, feel
And that's for real, real
And that's for real, real

[Verse 3]
Okay, you swerve in the Lexus, I pull up with your next bitch
O2' Wayne, cash money on the necklace
Always on the guestlist, oh and not to mention
Pick my worst song, bet it's harder than your best shit
I don't need a Tec clip to depress the tension
My lungs at recess, my heart is in detention
Start in the sense in the sense that I'm making
It's breaking and shaking you down in the pavement
Old and you're basic, I'm young and amazing
Chain never hanging, I'm gripping on a razor
Feel it with anger, zone turns danger
Friends turn strangers and words get fame

[Hook]
And that's for real, real
Don't give a fuck about how you feel, feel
And that's for real, real
And that's for real, real
