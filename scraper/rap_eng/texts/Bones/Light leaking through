[Verse]
sun leaking through the shades
making sure i live my day
bright light across my face
slowly shake me out my daze
being here is just a phaze
till the day im back in space
i would look around and feel just how it feels to fucking hate
take, every time i hate
spent it on some shit that aint
true how i want it
earth to looking, now is what i see
twisting branches poking out
willow weeping like me now
walking tag is off this grass
lime garden where we at
deep drugging
creep running
metamorphic pop the hermit
keep talking
we are the watchers of the planet
burning, self sustaining, fuck complaining
now i see what i need, and gain it.
take me to Chlorella, i feel better.
now my blood behaving.
watch me settle
hit the kettle
sleepy tea and blunts to thread em
all together, doubles better
so you know i back to back
im way to cash, to ever back
and we stay far away from that shit
please dont give us satisfaction
you light up with every click
