[Verse 1]
The legend, the myth
Hair to my ribs
Appear in the river, when times are grim
If I got your clothes, then you know what it is
Prove that I am wrong and I'll grant you the gift
In the river, I'm keening
Up in the wastes, I'm floating away
Wailing and screaming, you know what it means
That's you or your family, that's now on the way out
Say goodbye to the world
Close off your ties, if you see me in the dirt
Every birth is a curse
Some choose to reverse, some let it unearth
The trees resemble these crooked hands
Walking alone in no man's land

[Hook]
Wandering, wandering, wandering
Wandering, wandering, wandering

[Verse 2]
If you need it then you know I got the info
Take a right then it's down to the next road
Heirlooms glisten like the snow make my neck froze
Current strong and the wind Imma let it blow
If you need it then you know I got the info
Take a right then it's down to the next road
I'm the bean nighe showing in the white robe
Show you how to come back into life's room

[Hook]
Wandering, wandering, wandering
Wandering, wandering, wandering
