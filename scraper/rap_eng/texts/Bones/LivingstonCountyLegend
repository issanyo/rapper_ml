I'm trying to make a pill, not trying to make a mil
Just trying to make a pill to make them feel the way I feel
But I'm opposed to medicine, so I just got to deal
With feeling how I do on the daily all by myself

[Verse]
It's the truth from the booth, still yelling it out the roof
My brothers, they put me on, told me do that shit you do
Went from laptop mics and the lofts saving eighths
To I know we got a half left, but let's go get some weed
It's that 517, baby, my big bros raised me
Since a early age, rather rap than play with the neighbors
Used to post up magazine clippings, inspiration, reaching
Trying to catch it, wrap it up and rock it like an infant
G shit, Be back in '03 changed me
Three letters "JNL" ingrained in me
Bitch I turn to number 9, when it's time to break the ice
We been building through the night, don't look, confused now that we're right
Use the pull the E-Brake, back into the driveway
Never liked their way, that's why we do it our way
SESH embossed in the earth that we walk
Even when we go it won't, future fossils stand strong
