[Verse]
They say fuck the numbers
Then they post some pictures of em
Bouncing trend to trend like rubber
Changing up like every summer
Cannot fathom who would love em
Never got how someone could bump em
Then I realize they never related to this fucking world ever
Think you clever but at your level, you should play a lil safer
Ain't never untouchable my hand could not refrain from
Reaching out grabbing hoods like the teacher when you ain't good
When its time I'm dumping woods
When I'm out that's fucking bad
You hate me that's fucking good
I hope you rap, that fucking rad
No don't think that I'm not glad
It's just the way you do your act
Its the way you do just that
That's got me all so taken back

[Hook]
Waking up just to smoke like this
First thing watch it go like this
I don't like nobody knowing my deeds
So I'm high till the night I leave
And that's the way its always been
And I don't think that'll ever change
And that's the way its always been
And I don't think that'll ever change
That's just me being honest
