[Intro: Project Pat]
I only fuck with those who only fuck with me
A sucker play for games, a man play for keeps
I only fuck with those who only fuck with me
A sucker play for games, a man play for keeps
I only fuck with those who only fuck with me
A sucker play for games, a man play for keeps
I keep's me a nine millimeter just in case
A coward's in my face
These bullets he gone taste

[Verse]
See I don't wanna die so I keep on me a 9
See I just need some time to prove that the world is mine
Don't gotta say i'm dope, 'cuz they already know that th@ kid's flows are like beans from the store
These bitches already heard me
These bitches already swerving
These bitches already calling it ain't even 7:30
See timberland my boots
Versace on the suits
Rolex on my wrist
Chunk the dukes and bring the screw
See I ain't down south (no)
I ain't up north (ya)
I ain't west coast nor east I am tourin' (ya)
I'm everything you know
From that '94
That sound of choppin' shed slowly droppin' to the floor
I'm sippin' and blowin' my O's
I'm grippin' and pullin' the 4
I'm bangin' and swangin' I'm movin' and cruisin'
I'm lookin' at you and I'm slammin' the fuckin' door
Let it go, I'm in my zone
Look at my eye like fuck you on
Drugs in my blunt like fuck I'm gone
With the fuckin' team and we on, bitch

[Outro: Project Pat]
I only fuck with those who only fuck with me
A sucker play for games, a man play for keeps
I only fuck with those who only fuck with me
A sucker play for games, a man play for keeps
