[Verse]
Dope in my sock, run another block
Drugs in my veins keep going can't stop
Chains banging of my chest
Bright white skin young Eliot Ness
See I'm in my own space with my ???
Time to face the tests time to face the tests
See I take a jet on the way to mars
Just to prove that you ain't high as us, I'm cashed
Yeah, I'm cashed. Cash signs on my eyes guess I smoked too much
Cash signs on my eyes but fuck it roll another blunt. I'm cashed
Bitch I'm cashed
Life's too fast so let me slow it down
The only motherfucker that ever got out of Howell
The only fucking reason that you ever think of leaving town
But just look at you now, just look at you now
Diamonds turn to dirt, back where they came
Safe to say that I'll do the same when it's my fucking day
Until there I'mma roll this haze, keep these raps and do my thang
Every day is a movie-scene when you fucking live like me
Got that frostbite got that heat, bathe in a bathtub full of lean
Diamonds overflow my chain young Charmander with that flame, snare goes "bap" and the bass go "bang", spark it with my fucking team
Little of rap just a little of me T H @ K I D
