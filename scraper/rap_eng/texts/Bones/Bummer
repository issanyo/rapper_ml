[Intro]
"I did
I did. l hated having to go through that...
Caring, worrying and pain
That's not for me
And you know
It's not like that all ends...
When you're 18 or 21 or 41 or 61
It never, never ends
It's true
There is no end zone
You never cross the goal line
Spike the ball and do your touchdown dance
Never..."

[Verse]
I abuse and confuse my brain
Tell myself I want sun, then I produce rain
Never not knowing where it came
I hold on like I like this pain
My bad choices await to lead me to the grave like, "right this way"
Let me down easy, please don't tease me
When the time's up hearts don't tick neither
Say you got the answers but I don't wanna see em'
Even if you had them still I wouldn't wanna be you

[Hook]
Slow down it's a ride don't rush it
Slow down it's a ride don't rush it
Slow down it's a ride don't rush it
Slow down it's a ride don't rush it
