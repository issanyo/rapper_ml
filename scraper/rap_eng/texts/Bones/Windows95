[Verse 1: Bones]
I need you now more than ever, all these bitches tryna to get me
I need you to keep me leveled, I need you to come and save me
I want you to come and get me, I need you to fuckin' prove
Everything you said won't all be untrue
I'm down, that's just for you, it's all just me, I knew
Exactly what would happen if you really had to choose
College in the winter, you're gonna to leave soon
Tell me where I fit in just between me and you
Not tryin' to be the reason you goin' to hate me in the end
I'm not tryin' to be your friend, I'm not tryna be pretend
Fake words, real tears, know the story never ends
Every day another chance, you don't even fuckin' care
Put myself inside your hands, didn't know what that would do
Left me outside in the rain, gettin' dark, what do I do?
Deep breaths on the stoop, Backwoods gettin' smoked
All alone with my brothers, never catch me in the clubs
Leave you all behind, I could start a-fuckin'-new
I could wake up every day and I could never think of you
I wish that you truly knew what the fuck you needed to do
Maybe shit would've worked, maybe then I thought you knew

[Hook: Bones]
Leave you all behind, I could start a-fuckin'-new
I could wake up every day and I could never think of you
I wish that you truly knew what the fuck you needed to do
Maybe shit would've worked, maybe then I thought you knew
Leave you all behind...
