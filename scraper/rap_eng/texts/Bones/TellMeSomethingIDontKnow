[Intro]
Skaleaton

[Chorus: Andy Hull]
I didn't really want you to fall like that
Didn't really have time to take it back
And I was trying really hard to punish him
I didn't know that, didn't know that, didn't know that, didn't know that
I don't really want anyone else to feel like that
All I wanted was somebody to light the path
Didn't really matter what I wanted
Didn't really matter what I wanted

[Verse: Bones]
I know we can talk it out, but I don't want to
I am me, you are you, do what you want to
I know that sorry's are never enough to
Mend what I did, but it only feels right to
I am on a ride that I asked to be on
The point of no return's behind too far gone
I can never hide all this fear in my heart
So I will start by telling you I was wrong

[Bridge: Andy Hull]
You didn't know, oh, oh
You didn't know, oh, oh

[Chorus: Andy Hull]
I didn't really want you to fall like that
Didn't really have time to take it back
And I was trying really hard to punish him
I didn't know that, didn't know that, didn't know that, didn't know that
I don't really want anyone else to feel like that
All I wanted was somebody to light the path
Didn't really matter what I wanted
Didn't really matter what I wanted
