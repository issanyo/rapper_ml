[Verse]
Every single day gotta make that pay
Lie when you tell 'em that you spray that 'K
You don't want violence you don't want no pain
Actin' permanent never especially in this game
Bitch, no way, I'ma give her like a day
Matter of fact not even that, one more second until you fade
Just like that, gone in broad day
Workin' and lookin' like all you do is play
Speakin' different lingo I don't know what y'all say
Like the name of Me and Xay first tape, y'all Lame
Got somethin' to say for how you say rainy day
No need to say a thing if you ain't bout to say names

[Hook]
Hol' up wait a second I been feelin' all my senses frying
Twistin' till my fingers bleed and SESHin' till I'm fucking dying
Hol' up wait a second I been feelin' all my senses frying
Twistin' till my fingers bleed and SESHin' till I'm fucking dying
