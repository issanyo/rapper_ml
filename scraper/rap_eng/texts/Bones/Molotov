Light skin
Dark thoughts
Young cocktail, blowing up, Molotov
Mazel tov, congratulations
Round of applause
You have now made it
Gold chain, silver rings and platinum records
At the top, sleeping on ya'll bum bettin'
With [?] rhymes, give a fuck if you get it
But if you want bars, I can serve a life sentence
No question, therefore, I'm never askin'
"Who can keep up with the kid?" In this rap shit
You say you got better flow, I get it, keep going, Nancy
They all just pop, so all I'm seein' is soda cans
But I don't shake 'em
I don't touch 'em, I keep it movin'
White kid too much, so, I keeps it [?]
So nowadays everybody loves a rapper, but, only if you get love back from the game, so ya'll some bachelors
