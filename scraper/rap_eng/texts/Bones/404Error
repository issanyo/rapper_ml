[Intro]
Searching for file

[Verse]
Always talk about money, like it mean something you way too funny
Hope you get it in abundance spend it like you want it
Go and tell me how you does it
Salute me R.I.P. Stack Bundles
See me play now they calling for a huddle
I don't fight I don't get into a tussle
I don't ever gotta flex no muscle
Adrenaline running around my tracks
No don't tell Bones to relax
My feet up reclining rewinding to the day that we scrapped that cab
3 A.M, snow on the grass
3:06, we made them tracks
Don't know how we made it back its a fact that all I know's a regretful past

[Hook]
Frostbite, cover my hands up to my face I don't feel a thing
Frostbite, cover my hands up to my face I don't feel a thing
Wait!
Sitting in the back seat, where we going?
I can't recognize one face anymore
I don't know no one everything foreign
Fuck it all somebody help me out
