Sesh

[Verse]
Sitting on the stu
Fresh bowl of fruit
The sky is turing electric blue
The clouds are pink
My eyes are too
Bloodshot can't even move
I watch the sun when it rise up
And I watch the sun as it go down
And I watch the moon come up everynight
Shits unreal it's never slowing down

[Outro]
Its raining outside
I love the rain
I love the ocean
I love the eclipse
I love the water
I love the coffee
I love the wishes
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I wish I wasn't a robot
