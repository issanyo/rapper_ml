[Intro]
What if everything around you isn't quite as it seems?
What if all the world you think you know is an elaborate dream?

[Verse: Bones]
Dead like I'm Earnhardt, dope up in the dashboard
Smokin' like a Nascar, ash on the asphalt
Dirty fingernails, two pigtails
Bitch I look like Sandra Bullock, rollin' bones, speakin' spells
We don't like you, if you really couldn't tell
Your shows ain't shit and your flows ain't real
Your words ain't true and your style is the same
If you can't be yourself you deserve to die today
Drive away

[Outro x2]
Now my tires get to burnin'
Wheels get to turnin'
Bones get to swervin'
