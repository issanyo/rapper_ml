[Verse]
I got some problems I need to solve em
1st thing 1st tell your man keep working cause  I never heard about em
Or the outcome or the result
Probably think deep down that we see yall
How the fuck am I suppose to see
Something so petite and so un-unique
Need more than what you got to get me to turn
Get me to know a song get me to learn
But none of that's present ghost and it's evident
The ghost of the underground forever I be dwelling in
Sally by the seashore bitch you just selling it
Just like fast food bitch they be loving it
I love it too but in another way
Favorite thing has always been to see a life thrown away
By an unknown hand
Didn't know it was the end
Times up you delete
You so temporary man
