[Verse 1: Rozz Dyliams]
I could look into your eyes til i went blind
I could tell you got a lot thats on your mind
yeah
I could put you under pressure
To make you come alive
I could pick up
What you throw up from inside

[Bridge: Rozz Dyliams]
I could, always
I could, always

[Verse 2: Rozz Dyliams]
In this house built on the sea
The tables set for you and me
I have no choice but to flee
And crush my body on the rocks beneath

[Verse 3: Bones]
It's a constant motion, vertical floating
The feeling of knowing its nowhere were to go
Pigment is fading, patiently waiting
But you know what they say, it only gets better with everyday
For my last trick I will sink to the bottom
The water pressure is heavy so no you won't hear me
calling

I could, always
