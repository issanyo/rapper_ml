[Verse 1: Chris Travis] [x2]
I got water on me, baby right now
I can feel your heart beat steady right now
Tell me is you ready for me, right now
Will you be my mermaid with me, right now

[Verse 2: Bones] [x2]
Tell me what you need
Don't you tell me how you feel
Tell me what you dream
Baby I can make it real
Tell me how your nightmares end, with you waking up
Tell me how your nights get spent when you're all alone
