[Intro]
I'm sitting here, feeling sad
What happened to all the laughs we had
I'm trying to turn back to time
When I was yours and you were mine
These feelings are hard to find
As I'm watching the day go by

[Verse: Chris Travis]
We can go wherever baby, just know that I got it
When you wanna get wild, just come to the lobby
Six in the morning and I'm just gettin' started
Burnin' plants in my lungs, got to water the garden
I don't mean to be rude but baby girl I'm sorry
I don't want to fuck you girl, I'd rather play Atari
Try to start my own wave, but I made a tsunami
Would you rather be with me, shawty, just be honest
We could get rich together and share our money
Checks comin' in, bitch, by the fuckin' abundance
SmartWater drinkin', nigga, you can have your Dasani
Bitch walkin' right beside me, lookin' just like Ashanti

[Hook: Bones & Chris Travis]
I don't know where you are
I just hope you're safe and sound
I'm just gettin' money, please don't mind me
Hidden' in my layers where nobody can find me
I don't know where you are
I just hope you're safe and sound
I'm just gettin' money, please don't mind me
Hidden' in my layers where nobody can find me
