[Verse]
I don't need to clutch a TEC, I don't need a cup of tech
All I need's to see the moon rise and the sun to set
All I need is a nest in the woods where I can rest
Branches tappin on my window, birds wake me up to SESH
Consider that C4 on my chest if you really coming up trying to press
Take you with me on the wildest ride you've ever been on yet
Out this world, off this globe, back into what we don't know
What we never will, no matter the rate that human knowledge grows

[Outro]
Slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down, slow it down
