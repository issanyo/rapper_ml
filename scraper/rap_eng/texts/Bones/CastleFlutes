[Verse 1: Chris Travis]
I'm just doing what I do
Smoking weed with a brew
In a all white castle
As I hear the fucking flutes
I just wanna make my loot
As i tell y'all the truth
And my phone bout to die
So your calls ain't on route
Imma probably cop a coupe
Just to flex with the crew
Me & my nigga Bones smoking backwoods til we puke
I can't hear what you sayin' got your life on mute
Playin' footsies with your girl while we wrapped under a quilt!
On and on we go
And all I hear is on and on she go
On and on we go
And all I hear is on and on she go

[Verse 2: Bones]
I'm Casey, I'm JoJo
I'm crazy, I'm loco
These bitches look like Yoko
Oh no, they so gone
I'm so dead, I'm cash
I'm rollin blunts on my Mac
I'm feelin something like Young Dro the way the rubber bands just snap
It's the white Mike Jones, so they blowin up my phone
Coming down, just a young dumb fuck that could flow
I don't need your respect, I don't need your connect
All I need is my drugs and some woods for my nest
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up if you're not right here
I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up if you're not right here

[Verse 3: Xavier Wulf]
All you knuckleheads is hella scared
Y'all stupid y'all can't deal with this
I'm killin I will get with this so easily I do this shit
Why you niggas tryna be like me, you need to stop that shit
Y'all need to quit that shit so fuckin quick cuz y'all is ugly bitch
I don't give a fuck about how you feel or your fucking clothes
Nigga you can get your lame ass up out the door
Every time you see me I be with my fleet
And we be so damn clean
You be like god damn man
And your girl be like damn
I wanna be with them
Can we chill can we smoke or something
I be like "Hell naw bitch"
I got priorities that don't include you
And I'm doing what I gotta do for me & my crew
