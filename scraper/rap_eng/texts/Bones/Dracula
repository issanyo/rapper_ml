[Intro: Bones]
Yellin SESH, she screamin' "Bones'"
Yellin SESH, she screamin' "Bones'"
Yellin SESH, she screamin' "Bones'"
Yellin SESH, she screamin' "Bones'"
Yellin SESH, she screamin' "Bones'"
Yellin SESH, she screamin' "Bones'"
Yellin SESH, she screamin' "Bones'"
Yellin SESH, she screamin' "Bones'" (Bones)
Teenager, a little teen anger
And a flow that's something like coke (Sesh)
Fuck (Fuck) wit' me, I'm going ghost
Razorblade in my coat
Yellin sesh, she screamin' "Bones'"
Yellin sesh, she screamin' "Bones'"
Look at your boy tryin' to act all hard
Teenager, a little teen anger
And a flow that's something like coke
Fuck (Fuck) wit' me, I'm going ghost
Razorblade in my coat
Yellin SESH, she screamin' "Bones'"
Yellin SESH, she screamin' "Bones'"
Look at your boy tryin' to act all hard

[Verse 1: Bones]
Richie Rich when I'm countin' riches
Steve Butabi when I'm with my bitches
Rick Moranis when I'm hittin' switches
I'm blowin' up while I'm blunt-flickin'
Never diss you, I'm a different picture
Bitch move the frame, I could never miss her
If a girl want to fall deep down in love
She goin' to have to fuckin' learn how to roll a Swisher
I mix the mixture, I'm going ghost
Skinny white pimp in all chrome
Blade on, I'm never lonely
Lurkin' hard, see, I'm creepin' on you
I'm Dracula with my white skin
Black cape shine like the whip
Gold chain hang like a cross
Backwoods burn like sky at dawn
Moon rise, so do Bones
Front your house and front your lawn
Blowin' O's, I'm sippin' water
I'm going hard and you doing nada
I'm rap, I'm crack
I'm a meth lab when I snap
I'm heroin when I'm goin' in
I'm in the graveyard with my mask

[Hook: Bones]
You say you buzzin', but really I never heard of ya'
You play your music for your bitch and she say "Turn it off"
TeamSESH, just some young blunt-murderers
Comin' down, gettin' high, let's go roll up

[Outro: Bones]
Teenager, little teen anger
And a flow that's something like coke
Fuck (Fuck) wit' me, I'm goin ghost
Razorblade in my coat
Yellin SESH, she screamin' "Bones'"
Yellin SESH, she screamin' "Bones'"
Look at your boy tryin' to act all hard
Teenager, little teen anger
And a flow that's something like coke
Fuck (Fuck) wit' me, 'm goin ghost
Razorblade in my coat
Yellin SESH, she screamin' "Bones'"
Yellin SESH, she screamin' "Bones'"
Look at your boy tryin' to act all hard
