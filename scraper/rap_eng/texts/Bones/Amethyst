[Hook]
Nobody can hold up a candle to me
SESH be the team and we can't never leave
Nobody can hold up a candle to we
SESH be the team and we can't never leave

[Verse 1]
Now we walking through the jewelry store cashing shit
When we ride around and then we don't bag this shit
Money come and go so I don't look at tags for shit
Give me that give me that don't ask for shit
8 Pairs on my fingers with the sapphire decks
Hundred thousand dollars if you need my best
One million dollars if you need that sesh
Used to pour whatever just to get that fix
Ashing shining smoking in my diamonds
Outfits blind you the woods rewind you
Weapons eject but I don't do the pressing
Hundred million deadboys creeping for the pressure
Shows like a lecture they sitting no question
So you say you ride bitch boy you just flexing
Boy I know you see us and I know you just stressing
Tell yourself your good but deep down I know you isn't

[Hook]
Nobody can hold up a candle to me
SESH be the team and we can't never leave
Nobody can hold up a candle to we
SESH be the team and we can't never leave
