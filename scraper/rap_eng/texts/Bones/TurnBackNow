[Verse]
Broke and I smoke so, yeah
They got the money and they got the dope
Broke and I smoke so you know I need both
Do it no mask just to make sure you know
When you see Bones better board up the door
Not from the coast I came up from the road
Made up of dirty snow gravel and stone
Broke out the mold of inhaling the mold
It's bold how much hate that I got for the world

[Pre-Hook]
Fuck all of your negative energy
I don't want nothing to do with any of you
Let me talk my shit
Say you gon' do some shit won't you do
Say you know shit that you never would do
All I hear is this

[Hook]
I don't wanna hear no more
Talking all that shit before
I done heard it all a thousand times
I don't wanna hear your mouth
Talking all that shit before
I done heard it all a thousand times
