[Hook: Dylan Ross]
All I know is all I'm told
And from what I'm told I'm holy, I'm holy
All I know is all I'm told
And from what I'm told I'm holy, I'm holy

[Verse 1: Dylan Ross]
I'm zaggin' to the max, blowin' stacks and blowin' racks
Molly ain't my type of woman ho, I'd rather fuck with caps
I might break you off some bap, but I never give you dap
If you think you got some ana, state your business with my strap
I'm buckin' off the map, and I'm lookin for the cap, lookin' for the chewin', watcha doin', drop it in my lap
Let me know what you about, if you think that you can ride
Ice skatin' in the century, bumpin' TeamSESH inside
In the subs I got that work, young n thuggin' like lil turk
Pushin' product just like burt, 100 grand in Gucci purse
I can get it drastic, but you do not want it to be worse
If my anger bubble burst, I'm makin' hollow tips disperse
From the grave I'm reppin' SESH, bury me in kevlar vest
Got some ana on my chest, I simply cannot let it rest
I might put you on the track, and see if you can pass the test
Pimpin' as a mack, I gotta keep my wealth all to myself
SESH

[Verse 2: BONES]
Dopin' by myself, pimpin' bitches off the shelf
It's the skinny white pimp, motorola's on my belt
Bitch I came from the grave, words crawlin' through my veins
Blood drippin' from my bones, switch blade up on my waist
Bitch I'm rollin, I'm zonin', my eyes closed and I'm flowin'
I disappear when I'm goin', feed her pills and tell her call me in the morning
No I ain't afraid to take a mother's son away
I stay with me, some killers that will fight for me
Ridin' around, just me and you, blowin' dope out the fuckin' roof
Ash cover my dashboard, I'm a living legend, that's just the truth
Ridin' around, just me and you, blowin' dope out the fuckin' roof
Ash cover my dashboard, I'm a living legend, that's just the truth

[Pre-Hook 2X]
You've always known just what I wanted to do
(Just what i wanted to do, Just what i wanted to do)

[Hook: Dylan Ross]
All I know is all I'm told
And from what I'm told I'm holy, I'm holy
All I know is all I'm told
And from what I'm told I'm holy, I'm holy
