[Intro]

Yeah, right about now Compton's in the mothafucking house Yeah
Tell'em Where you from
Yeah, SESH
What?

[Verse 1]
Whole lot of money, got a whole lot of bitches
Got a whole lot of cars with a whole bunch of switches
White folks hate me cause they say I'm acting different
Tie they shoestrings and bump them down, say "they must be tripping"
A bottle of Tanqueray, mixed with some Alizé
A dash of that Hennessey and the bottle say E and J
Bitch that's Serenity. I take it like, every day
I kill it in every way, scary white pimp and I'm here to play

[Hook]
Let it bang bang if you're gang gang, so if you down to roll
Gonna roll over to the creek and get that pistol on my draw
I'm the sickest, the wickest, all these women I'm flipping
I got some guards that I'm splitting, put some drugs up in it
Spitting some venom, flowing so heavy, baby if you down to roll
Gonna roll over to the crib, grab the sheets, and lock the door
Bitch, I'm sick of explaining these games, is you down to roll?
If not, just let me know. I always got blunts to roll

[Interlude]
What? What? What? Team SESH. That Kid. Team SESH. That Kid. Fuck you. Yeah. What? What? What? What? What? What?

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in your city, looking all so pretty
All black, got a black MAC that match my black hoodie
Neck dripping in gold, wrist dripping in platinum
Hundred blunts in a hundred minutes, now I don't know what happened
Now, all I got is my brothers, all I got is my team
See, all I got is my flows, see all I got is my beats
All you got is your bitch until she leave with me
Then all you got is that TV that you turn on and see me
Every rap's a crime scene, 187 — my rhyme scheme
The bast rapper's that ever lived, my flows always remind me
Of the underground behind me, so give a fuck if you sign me
The only cracker spitting crack, these other kids just rhyme things

[Outro]
What? What? Team SESH. That Kid. Bitch, yes. Yeah. What? What?
