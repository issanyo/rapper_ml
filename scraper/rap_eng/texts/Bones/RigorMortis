[Verse]
Skeleton
Dead elegance
You soft like Eberjey
This blunt I ain't sharin' it
We what they starin' at
Like we sellin' it
Grave on my chest and it Bam like Element
Try to touch it, you get froze like the elements
Then I defrost them with the heat that is the hell in me
Make them feel defeat
Give me 50 feet
Midwest motherfucker straight up out the weeds

[Hook]
Still sitting in the car with the radio on
Watching life as it pass me by
Try to turn off my brain, throw away all the shame
Starting a new today but I fail
Every time
Every line that I speak I fall behind
I'm my mind, but you're my heart
I think that I might be falling apart
