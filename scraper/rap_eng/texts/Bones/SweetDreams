[Verse 1]
What, Bones, Bones
What, what, SESH
If you really wanna fuck with me, bring some money
If you really wanna smoke blunts, know I've got plenty
Give a fuck if you ready
Give a fuck if you're not
Young pimp named BONES, got the flow in the lot
It's like that y'all, like that y'all, s' like that, that, it's like that y'all
Now jump around, now jump around
I throw it back like Criss Cross
Sip my Cristal
Looking in my rear like really is this all?
Life that chose me, teen that hold heat
Young Jug grown a down in the street
Never around, he's sleeping
In the ground, 6 feet
BONES in the graveyard with the new white teeth (teeth)
News by lean, in the new white Beam
With my bass so loud, your radio [?]
Like wow (wow), let me slow that down
Let me show you around, like you new in town
Let me hold my ground
Let me smoke the ounce
Let me crack the Swisher, and let me gut them out
I'm rollin, rollin, Fred Durst rollin'
Fiddy cap, flip back, Fred Durst flowing
Hair like Manson, Team SESH mansion
Somewhere in the hills, flickin' ash, I'm dancing

[Verse 2]
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I've traveled the world and the  seven seas
Bones
SESH
