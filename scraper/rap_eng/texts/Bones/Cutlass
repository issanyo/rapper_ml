[Verse]
Slidin' in my cutlass slammin the bump up on the speaker box
Prayin' to yoself I can't relate bitch I don't need a god
Find me where the demons are, ridin' in the demon car
Stone stick shift, know it's bones when you see the car
Killin' it better believe it tho
Murder right up in yo stereo
Tell me now what's a scenario
Two swishers rolled now here we go
Yo girlfriend she called you and she told you that she home
She hang up, the shots in mouth, now she ridin' round she with bones
Now she posted up in my home
Whole room smellin' like smoke
She in my bed with my chain on and when she go to sleep I'm ghost
She tell me that she like the flow she know the words to my music
She naked under that shirt of mine so please don't confuse it
I ain't lyin' I do it
Bitch you home doin' nothin'
See everyday's a fucking Saturday, I'm livin' life and I love it
One million blunts rolled up for the drive, it's the slim white pimp dollar signs on my eyes
