[Verse 1]
Tell them that they need to backtrack, back it up
Bones make them backpack flat, pack it up
Back in school used to laugh, laugh, laugh it up
Now they mad when they see buildings getting packed for us
Now I can see everything from here
Found the highest elevation, point and set up camp there
Now I spend my days binded to the purpose of my searching
For the reason that they leaving earth to make a modest purchase
I condemn myself to worthless, rest my eyes until they hurting
Crooked teeth show through the leaves, if you see me don't say a thing
Be completely still, will only hurt a little
The shadows jumping off of me to spell out how I'm feeling

[Hook]
I think its time to let them know
Crack a laugh when I hear you act sad on the low
You could travel the globe, you could rally the shows
But comparing you to me, I'm not having it though
I think its time to let them know
Crack a laugh when I hear you act sad on the low
You could travel the globe, you could rally the shows
But comparing you to me, I'm not having it though

[Bridge]
Fuck around and make me lose it
Fuck around and make me move you
Talking like you shooting like movies
You will get cut like boo boos
Fuck around and make me lose it
Fuck around and make me move you
Talking like you shooting like movies
You will get cut like boo boos

[Outro]
Any time, any rhyme, I pick up on every vibe
Come correct like every time, you wait in line we make the line
