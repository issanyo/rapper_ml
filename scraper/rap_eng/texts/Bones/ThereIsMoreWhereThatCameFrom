[Verse]
Feeling like Busta, gimme some more
Kicking in the door while I'm hittin' the dope
Weather kinda off but I'm feelin' it though
Rain clouds coming in like its ready to pour
Precipitation, mean vacation that's a good enough day for me
Came from the place with the ice on the ground, it's snow piled up on every tree
Twenty two, what it do, bitch I make that money
Do boomerang moves, put a little down and more be coming through
Running through wood packs I know I gotta stop with that
Planet wouldnâ€™t turn correctly if I ever left
Windows getting fucking bust, sell it all, smoke the profit, end up broke within a month
That was life in a place called death
The rest went right so I said I'll go left

[Hook]
Boy you can't do it like this
They hear me and say lets do it like him
If you getting it then you should soak it in, cause your hourglass is running out of sand
Boy you can't do it like this
They hear me and say lets do it like him
If you getting it then you should soak it in, cause your hourglass is running out of sand
