[Verse 1]
Think about it for a second, yeah it's all in my head
It's not safe for me when I am alone in there
Please save me from myself I am my only regret
Every day's another chance I remember you said
Either I'm down in the dumps or I can't leave the bed
Never "Ok" for a day I am losing my breath
Haven't found it for a week I'm hoping all is ok
If I ever fall asleep without you here I won't wake

[Chorus]
Night
Time
Falls
Down
Night
Time
Falls
Down

[Bridge]
I never said that this would be easy
Floating on my back down the river still
Fingers crossed this current treats me well
Farewell

[Chorus]
Night
Time
Falls
Down
Night
Time
Falls
Down

[Interlude]
"You are making me mad, you are hurting my [?]"
"I cannot believe this is going on"
"Alright you are projecting"
"What, let me tell you something, my friend'
"We don't need to get physical about this"
"Alright Andy, Andy"

[Refrain]
No don't fuck with me I'm trying not to knock you off
No don't fuck with me I'm trying not to knock you off
No don't fuck with me I'm trying not to knock you off
No don't fuck with me I'm trying not to knock you off

[Outro]
What, what, what, what
Sesh, Sesh
Bones, Greaf
