[Hook]
People wanna get close when the money come
And the beat goes on "parara-ram-pam-pam"
Gimme a second, I need to catch the tempo, tempo
Gimme a second, I'm caught in the limbo
People always gather round where the fire starts
They don't ever wanna help till we in the dark
Gimme a second, I need to catch the tempo, tempo
Gimme a second, I'm caught in the limbo

[Verse]
I used to sleep on a pool table
Now I got tables that's out by the pool
Back then thought life was a cruel fable
Now I realized I just didn't read through

[Hook]
People wanna get close when the money come
And the beat goes on "parara-ram-pam-pam"
Gimme a second, I need to catch the tempo, tempo
Gimme a second, I'm caught in the limbo
People always gather round where the fire starts
They don't ever wanna help till we in the dark
Gimme a second, I need to catch the tempo, tempo
Gimme a second, I'm caught in the limbo
