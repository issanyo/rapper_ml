[Verse: Chris Travis]
I can not feel no pain, no we are not the same
I set the streets on fire then I wash it up with rain
The clouds soon will form in unparticular ways
I've seen to get paid on unpredictable days
My eyes wide open, tattoos on my veins
Red mask on my face, bitch, you can call me Kane
Wake up in the morning, every day is the same
Do what I got to do and set the whole world to flames
We up on a quest to get out of this place
If we 'bout to get rich, that's the only choice to make
And fuck every enemy that come up in our way
Leave their ass on the ground, for their brain to decay

[Outro: Bones]
I'll love you 'till I die, I'll never tell you lies
Just know your body's safe when you're lying next to mine
I'll put you on the moon, I'll drop you in the sky
And if you ever fall I will catch you before you die
