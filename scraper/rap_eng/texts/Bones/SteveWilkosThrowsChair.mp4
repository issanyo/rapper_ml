[Verse 1]
What?
Bones droppin' outta sector, unknown like a lone
Drone set to go in one mode, remove
Everything and anything opposed me doomed
Leave my zone or quickly gain a tomb, the moon
Hit my face and crawled down to my boots, the truth
Is breakin' out the ground like the roots, a truce
Is something I have never learned to do so proof
With that proposition, no, we are not cool
Yellow gold, green stones, look like U of M at state
Built ready for this life, if you ain't we can't relate
Ain't gon wait on nobody if they ain't from 'round my side of shit
SESH on my neck, you know what I'm 'bout to rep
Ain't gon wait, I'ma skate, I'ma hit the Triple Deke
I'ma knuckle puck and smoke a blunt, I'll hit you in a week
I'ma sleep, I'ma think, fill the kettle, make some tea
Bathe in silence, sleep in violence, I'm the contrast you can't see
Throw my money to the wind while you out here tryna get it
It's just paper (It's just paper)
It's just paper (It's just paper)
It's just paper (It's just paper)
It's just paper
Just another reason why the world goin' crazy

[Hook]
Ready to go, ready to throw, let me know
(Another season, another reason)
Ready to go, ready to throw, let me know
(Another season, another reason)
Ready to go, ready to throw, let me know
(Another season, another reason)
Ready to go, ready to throw, let me know
(Another season, another reason)
