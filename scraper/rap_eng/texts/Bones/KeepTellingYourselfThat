[Verse 1]
The boy in the bubble the furthest from trouble
When I look at you, it's like damn
You give me sympathy practically instantly
I feel so bad like how could I be mad
You on some shit I don’t want
You on some shit I done did
We all got idols but don’t feel too high up
And fall to untimely end
Go ahead out with your friends
Ima stay in and make ends
Meet, like a blind date
Fuck what the time say
If it ain't five to sesh then I can't
You yet to see the best that I can
Earth will end if Bones get uncanned
Sherpa lined everything let them see every stain
Fifty-nine everyday burnt to the membrane
Flashback slumped in the breezeway
Thinkin' I can't do this shit forever
Fuck doing there way ima go my way
Hundred high ways not long enough for my race
Ima take it further than that
All these pussies think they take it further than rap, no
You take it nowhere quick, nobody give a fuck 'bout the money that you get and
If you convince yourself any different
Its safe to say you gone and been missing
Off in a land I could have predicted
Molded by thoughts of those who don’t get ya
The scum has arisen
And no bitch dont tempt me
Cause I have been patiently waiting for my time to lose it
Please come and offend me

[Verse 2]
Feeling something like Larry David
Observe the world and then i get to shamin'
Shit go wrong i'm the one they blamin'
While the rest get on stage and they blow it like kramar
Stranger-stranger, who really stranger?
Cause I dont know you but I know my anger
Worried about your album say you need more bangers
Bones never approach that ledge with danger
Say you a star end the conversation
Me and my brothers make the constellation
Ima get it now i'm far from patient can't sit still I forever go crazy
The store clerk know what I need when I walk in
Who bought out the bricks first night that they got in
Who got what they need when they need it i'll drop hints
I'm pointing all over like I promise it's not him
