[Intro: Misa's Song]
Be careful what you do
Cause god is watching your every move
Hold my hand in the dark street
For if you do I know that I'll be safe

[Verse 1: Bones]
What?
Coming down slick
It's a young white pimp
25s on the rims
20 bitches on my dick
Beeper beeping off da hook
Switchblade got 'em shook
Take your first love away
Turn that girl into my slave
Feed her drugs all day
Then I bury her at night
Hundred xans, hundred plans, I done turn the route right
No chain on my neck
No watch on my wrist
Just a blunt up in my hand
Sippin' ice cold Cris
Fiji water shower getting clean blowinâ€™ smoke
Fuck a $100 t-shirt
Hand me downs on my bones
You can have the fashion
I don't need it when I'm rapping
Set a fire to your Gucci and I'm burning down your cabin
You a pussy and you know it
You acting like you hard
Cause you don't wanna show it'
You really just a bitch
You really just a bitch

[Hook: Bones]
Drugs in my veins
Bitch I'm high all day
Ain't a damn thing changed
Since the fuckin' eight grade
Drugs in my veins
Bitch I'm high all day
Ain't a damn thing changed
Since the fuckin' eight grade

[Verse 2: Wavy Jone$]
I'm still the same kid
Doing the same shit
With two blunts up on my lip bitch
I bump Limp Bizkit when I flip bricks
That black biscuit gonna hit licks
I got white rocks in my white socks
I been chopping blocks since blacktops
Drop the top, give me brain
Ain't shit changed since 8th grade
Sgt. slaughter, camo bucket
Top rope and I'm throwing suck its
Road dog off that chyna white
In that D-X tank we gon ride tonight
I'm all black and gold, Dustin Rhodes
Herringbone from 94
My bitch thick like big show
Like Monday night I keep my shit raw
I'm getting high with your bitch
While I lie with your bitch
We gonna ride for the night
She willing to die for this dick
Homicide in my eyes
Redrum in my cup
When I die, bury me with a blade and a blunt
Jone$
