Ridin' in the car with it
Lyin' under stars with it
Stop then I part with it
I ain't gonna start with it
Lightin' up cigars with it
Smoking and livin' large with it
Do it 'fore you're gone bitch
Dead in designer clothes bitch

Interlube

Ridin' in the car with it
Lyin' under stars with it
Stop then I part with it
I ain't gonna start with it
Lightin' up cigars with it
Smoking and livin' large with it
Do it 'fore you're gone bitch
Dead in designer clothes bitch
