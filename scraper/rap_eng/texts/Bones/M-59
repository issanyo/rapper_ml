[Verse: Bones]
M-59, if you need a ride
Trash bag full of soda cans when we drive
Back home, it was a can for a dime
We were up at Kroger's, peaking hands and waiting lines
Cash out of aluminium
People think we're foolin' em
Get it how you live it
Something we always did
(We always did)
And we were used to judgments, and we were used to hate
So obviously it's really nothing new
Say we were used to talking behind our backs
One thing I didn't get was it

[Hook: Bones]
We've been stuck in this place for far too long
It's time that we make it work for us now
(Make it work for us now)
My brain is numb for you
My brain is numb for you
