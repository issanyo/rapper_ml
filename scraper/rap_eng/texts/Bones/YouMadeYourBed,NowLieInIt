[Verse 1]
Looking into the mirror and I don't see shit
It's the cashed white myth from the 517 sticks
Boots say TeenWitch, mud stuck to the grip
Bag zipped, blade tucked, cargos stuffed to the brim
Now anytime you hear a clock tick call me Mr. Blunt Twist
Step up to the deadboy, that's how you get done quick
Done with, I'm yelling cut action if you actin tough
Set the sirens off, you hear the tone like I ain't picking up
Never will there ever be some others on our level
Try to throw some dirt on SESH and Bones will quickly grab the shovel
Fuck a muzzle, speaking ruckus, tonight you will sleep in rubble
I got something, fuck some muscle, you will disintegrate if I touch you

[Pre-Hook]
I got brand new dope, make it last
And for my next trick, I will turn this blunt to ash
I got brand new dope, make it last
And for my next trick, I will turn this blunt to ash
Bones

[Hook]
TeamSESH, 2017 until infinity
People change up quick while I'm still begging for a different me
Fuck up out my Z-O-N-E with that, "Hey, remember me?" (ah)
When I needed help you watched me crawl and struggle on my knees

[Outro]
Now how does it feel to wake up inside a world
Being you, knowing I am right here (right here)
Now how does it feel to wake up inside a world
Being you, knowing I am right here
And I'm not going anywhere (anywhere, anywhere)
Not going anywhere (anywhere, anywhere)
What?
SESH
SESH
Bones
Team, team, team, team
What?
