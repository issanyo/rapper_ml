[Verse]
Death up in my cup, clutchin' blunts, light 'em up
Same color blood, it's the skinny white dove
I can never give a fuck 'cause that just ain't me
I get high, so alive, now I'm P.O.D
W.P.O.D, that's White Punk On Dope
See, the only thing I've ever done in my life is flow
I'm so gone in my song, I disappear into baits
I pop up in the middle with no name, no face
Find me sittin' at my place, Netflix all day
Double Y's to the neck, can't feel my face
Hate your life so much, can't feel that pain
I can't really relate, on clean ice I skate
Sharp blades, calm wager, see Bombay
With the team, white shirt clean
They're tryin' to be me, they wanna be sick
But there's only one Bones, one skinny white pimp

[Outro]
I'm off a lot of drugs
I'm off a lot of drugs
I'm rolling up my blunts
I'm off a lot of drugs
