[Intro - Sample "Pimp Tha Pen" x4: Lil Keke]

Pop In Your Grey Cassette
Turn Up Your Fuckin' Deck
Lend Me Your Ear Because The Southside Finna Wreck

[Verse]
Bass clappin' like a Mac-10
Automatic weapons
The only way that I can paint a picture for my reverends
Ain't nobody get me, I'm feelin' like an orphan
Endorphins swimmin' through my veins like dolphins
Used to dream all this, from writin' to recordings
To boardin' flights every night now that we tourin'
I've never paid the mortgage so I guess it's fuckin' time to
Get high, get paid it's just what I was designed to do
Comin' down, switchin' lanes, just how I was taught
From the rappers that cam before me in them candy painted cars
No, I ain't got a license but I got a fuckin' bike
Big ole blunt, dead of the night, 4 a.m lets take a ride
Lets get high, lets get high
Pedal slow, pedal slow
Up the block around the corner to the store, to the store
I got 5 dollars in quarters and Ima let it go two [?] and two cigarillos

[Hook]

I'm never comin' down comin' comin' comin' down never
Comin' down comin' comin' comin' down never
Comin' down comin' comin' comin' down ya
Comin' down comin' comin' comin' down ya
