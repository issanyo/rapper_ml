[Verse: Bones]
Got what you need, anything like Gibraltar Trade
Let me know, bring some dough, we'll set the time and day
I'm trying to make a place, we could all get away
SE$H Compound in the hills, where we could all create
I ain't switchin' lanes, boy, I'm in the shade
Fuck sellin' drugs, I'd rather do one of for the age
I'm trying to reach a high that'll never ever fade
To make the world work for us is something that we need

[Hook: Bones]
Doing what we want, but they still try and come and talk it down
We're like, "Fuck it now."
