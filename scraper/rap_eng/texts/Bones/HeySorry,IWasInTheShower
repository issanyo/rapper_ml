[Verse]
Stepping up my block, young Bones let me rot
Over thinking non-stop, till my mind in a box
Cash, and I'm shaking, so I cannot pick the lock
A.M to P.M, from tick to tock
While they worry about being top, I'm just happy that I got to be alive
While they strive just to be called the best, feel lucky that I ever got breath
I can walk, I can talk
I can move like a human
Filaments running through my limbs, like the stems of a tulip
Last thing I want is money, first thing I want is sunlight
Photosynthesis, collecting rays until the sun dies

[Hook]
Take in the rays, and give me some rain
It's all I can do, it's all that I need, it's all I can take
It's all I can do, it's all that I need, it's all I can take
Is it all I can take? Is it all I can take?
Is it all I can take? Is it all I can take?
