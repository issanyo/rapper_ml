[Verse 1]
When the princess dies is it game over?
If doors could talk, would they ever have closure?
Is a loving mother's son ever a soldier?
Is it ever too much weight I try to shoulder?
When I try my best is it truly?
If I was a country, would you rule me?
Or would you fold me up like a map
When you find your path and you're back on track?
These are questions I feel never will be answered
Will we be this planet's helper or its cancer?

[Verse 2]
When my eyes open up, tell me what do I see first?
If your dreams turned to female would you seek her?
Can I still go on if I don't want to be here?
How long should I hold out 'til life seems fair?

[Verse 3]
Will my ears betray me if I finally start believing you?
Will I walk outside one day and see the sky not being blue?
Will we ever reach a time when humans aren't so see-through?
Would you be somebody else if you could not be you?
These are questions I feel never will be answered
Will we be this planet's helper or its cancer?
