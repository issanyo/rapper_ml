[Verse]
Smokin'
Just the right amount I swear to god I'm floatin'
Focused
Never off my shit never showin' signs of slowin'
Chosen
Never asked for shit but of course, now everyone know me

I'm draped in diamonds it won't help your ego to notice

[Hook]

The things that they saying I might be beyond i

[Outro]
Smokin' all the time, the money ain't there
People get gold, but the money ain't there
All of my time, I rather be here
People get money and get murdered in here.
