[Verse 1: Bones]
Looking life Wolfwood
Feeling like Vash
Three moons in the sky
Two blunts in my hand
Blade on my waist if you tryna take a stance
Zero patience, quit the playing
Come and do just what you said
I got money in the mattress, bones in the casket
No, I don't know you but I know you ain't rapping
The teenage corpse, never catch me in a Porsche
Rather creep through these alleys till I'm back up in the dirt

[Hook]
Riding, sliding, dollar sign eyelids
Riding, sliding, dollar sign eyelids
Riding, sliding, dollar sign eyelids
Riding, sliding, dollar sign eyelids

[Verse 2: Eddy Baker]
Bitch, I'm getting paid now
Money in my PayPal
Known as the mantle, what them haters got to say now?
Getting cash, life is great
Eating shrimp fried rice with steak
Fucking hella hoes, I don't ever take 'em out on dates
Me and Bones rolling up that dank, getting hella bank
Smoking out the zip, all day, put away your 8
Black shades cover up my face, I can't see the hate
Take a Backwood to the dome then I meditate
We ain't never gave a shit, we just out here stacking chips
D boy fire plus I'm higher than a mountain is
Dirty money all up in my hands and I'm counting it
Headed to the top, will I make it? You can count on it, bitch
