[Verse 1]
Whoever say they do it hasn't ever seen me do it, that's just apparent
I hate myself, I agree that's a sentiment that we sharing
You should never be content with your shit
Matter of fact, you should be embarrassed
Let me clarify for the camera
Bones don't acknowledge negative gestures
I don't reply to knock off banter
No, I don't drink if it's not organic
No, I don't smoke if it's not outstanding
Bitch, I been cashed too many years in the basement
Impossible to face me, the dark made me faceless
A cold white hand coming out the vast blankness
Me, I'm only seen when I wanna see their faces
Years worth of hits what you sittin on ain't shit

[Hook]
Pack up the flows, head out on the road, do as many shows
As you can 'cause I promise time will go
Faster than you've ever seen it before
Goodbye to the seconds, farewell to the minutes
Today you were found, tomorrow you're missing

[Verse 2]
You know that I see through ya
You know there's nobody you foolin'
Bones on the hunt again and I don't know just how he's planning to do ya
You know I will eventually find you
You know I've always been the kind to hold onto grudges
And keep them inside until these planets collide

[Outro]
Fuck what you heard unless you heard it from me
We don't deserve a thing let alone a chance to breathe
Fuck what you heard unless you heard it from me
We don't deserve a thing let alone a chance to breathe
