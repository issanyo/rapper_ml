[Verse]
Nightrat, motherfucker, I don't rap motherfucker
Flow blasts on suckers, graveyard rolling blunts, so
They all know my name, they all know my aim
Land and a mansion, living life for my team
Got my eye to the sky, clouds rolling in
Bring the storm, let it roar
When I rap, make it pour
White noise on the screen, Bones on the creep
Now you sleep in the fridge, one slash make 'em freeze
Not trying to be cool, not trying to be sick
Not trying to be dope, bitch it's just the way I is
2-006. At the crib sipping Cris', Jacob Jeweler on my wrist
Lotta stones, let it glisten
Stereo slapping, penthouse napping
Black leather couch, gold tray full of ashes
Cherry oak cabinet, drugs I'm ashing
Smoking by myself. Tryna hit it? Can't have it
Find me in the back. Alleyway rat
Torn up jeans with a razor in my pack
Long hair, flip it back. House shoes, kick it back
Fresh lemonade in my mason glass
See, imma shake patrol, imma break the dash
Cop lights in the corner of my eye, let 'em pass
Too young for bars, still ain't got no car
Motherfuck your favorite rapper tryna play the star
Throw us money up high, get that ass down low
Til' you lose all your money, and you wish you woulda know
When you young and you dumb and you rich blowin' dough
20 years down the road, now you motherfuckin' broke
Now you old and you broke, 20 years down the road
Now you wish you woulda know, now you wish you woulda know

Wish you woulda know. Yuh, what, yeah

Okay
Riding by myself. Well, really not really
So heavy in the trunk, make the car pop a wheelie
Chandelier ceiling, pay-per-view billing
Summer Slam '98, big television

Okay
Riding by myself. Well, really not really
So heavy in the trunk, make the car pop a wheelie
