[Intro]
TEVAL

[Hook]
You ain't really out here sellin' zips, zips (boy)
You could do a tour and make Zip, Zip (nada)
Zero competition so they pissed, pissed (ah)
I get on a stage and just rip, rip

[Verse 1]
They say I wanna do it like you do, Bones
You radiating something like your Bluetooth on
The glimmer in the night, you the hope that we owe
I ain't shit but a corpse, it's the flow that put me on
Early in the morning (what)
Cutting up roaches
Stretching and yawning (fuck)
SESH been up on it (what)
What's an opponent?
It's been so long since I've known one
Early in the morning (what)
Cutting up roaches
Stretching and yawning (fuck)
SESH been up on it (what)
What's an opponent?
It's been so long since I've known one

[Pre-Hook]
Please boy, please boy, please talk shit
Always tell your bitch, you ain't fucking with the clique
Acting like this, get you gone in a pinch
Only face to face when I talk, fuck a diss
Waiting, waiting, waiting
I've been waiting on you
Waiting, waiting, waiting
I've been waiting on you
What?

[Hook]
You ain't really out here sellin zips, zips (boy)
You could do a tour and make Zip, Zip (nada)
Zero competition so they pissed, pissed (ah)
I get on this stage and just rip, rip
What?

Beat Change

[Verse 2]
Hating then you must be new to the game
Where were you when me and Xay made Lame
Where were you when me and Chris made that SeaBeds
Eddy get ready, I told you we'd see this
El let it drop, I get it done
Fuck all them stories, you ain't from the block
Dodging them shots, you were folding your sock
Act like you out here, but no, you is not
