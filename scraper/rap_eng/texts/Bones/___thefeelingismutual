[Chorus]
The world stood still when you left this place
It shook my bones, your help's too late
I'm on a predictable road to the bottom now
The world stood still when you left this place
It shook my bones, your help's too late
I'm on a predictable road to the bottom now

[Outro]
"Now, what I say is- I say, music kicked my ass and I only intend to return the favor. You learned about it, opened your mind up, it's like a gift. And then you have a choice with that gift. Like, you could keep it for yourself, pass it along as a gift, or you polish it up, you sell it. But when you sell it, it's no longer a gift."
