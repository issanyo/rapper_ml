People cryin'
People dyin'

I jus' hope we can (x2)

Find a way (x2)

Find a way to do somethin' (x2)

When the walls cave in now, who do you turn to?
When everythin' lost, who do you run to?
If you got someone you're a lucky one
Cus' i'm livin' in the world with nobody there; no, no, no
But you don't live with that; no, no, no
Still okay with that; no, no, no
I get high sometimes, I relapse sometimes
Just like everybody

No, no, no, no (x5)

Underwater I'm caught up in emotion
Like I'm sleepin' at the bottom of the ocean
Underwater I'm caught up in emotion
Like I'm sinkin', sinkin' with the ocean
Underwater I'm caught up in emotion
Like I'm singin' yeah singin' in the ocean
Underwater I'm caught up in emotion
So now I'm sleepin' yeah sleepin' with the ocean

I'm just sleepin' in the ocean
And you didn't know
