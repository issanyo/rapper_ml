[Verse]
It's the IRL Nightmare, wake up I’ll be right there
Find me at the top while you remain the hype man
Alrighty then, Ace Ventura how they bite me
20k for flight fare, to me that's just a light day
Sitting in the cockpit, pilot Bones reporting in
I land with ease while recording this at 4 AM
A microphone, that's all I really need
And whatever the team want, just put it on me
See, I bring home the bread and the butter
I focus on creating while you focused on stunting
So go out to the parties and wonder why you got nothing
I’mma stay home making these records until the sun up
That's the Sesh way, I could never change
Never see me at the club trying to be seen
You can run that scene, you can throw that green
I'mma lock my doors, I'mma never ever leave
Yeah you got ice, nowadays who doesn't
Then again, yours lookin cloudy like it be stormin
Talking low grade stones with some piss poor clarity
I feel like I'm so ahead, it's almost not fair to be me
Papa Bones, tell us how it work
First they sign a shitty deal, then they get hurt
But they can't show it so they grab money and blow it
Everybody make me cringe and I don’t think that will be slowin
Anytime, so feel the temperature in the room
Change like the seasons, turn your block into a tomb
Bitch kaboom, bitch kaboom, bitch kaboom
Bitch kaboom, bitch kaboom, bitch kaboom
