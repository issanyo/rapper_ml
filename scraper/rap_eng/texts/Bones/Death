Don't get too comfortable, the money's for motherfuckers finna punish you
Come for you, for the darkest shit, dumber than dumb when the substance lit
Little bit nice when the dank was in 'em, the little tie dyes are my favorite visions
30 ghetto boys and the gangster isms, cos if I didn't have rap I was straightening women
From the 40 farm with the black cap back, runnin' out the whip cos the slap crash fast
Got a mask and a vest and a massive aggression, I'm packin' a pistol it's natural selection
You packin' the bowl and you pass to the next one, cold in the soul so practice affection but fuck it, let's get it tragic in Texas
Hydrocodones on my face itches scratchin' till I go faceless
This basement's where we get wasted and make these tapes so nonsensical
Walk into school, follow the laws of the mystic rule, pickin' they pockets and lickin' a shot
Cos you missing the point if you think that my mission is profit

[Bones:]
What
Bad motherfucker and my attitude match that, get cashed and I see those flashbacks
All black with the motherfuckin' ratt pack, big blunt full of dope I ash that
I'm in the grave six feet deep, got a big screen no HD, I flick ash and watch TV, N64 no PS3
MAC D.L.E on my speaker box, call the cops my speakers not
White thug never gave a fuck, gettin' rich quick tell me why we should stop
My razor blade in my right hand, brass knuckles up in my left
Not acting hard just being Bones, just rolling drugs on my step
Yeah

Cup full of that life
Swisher full of that death
Skull full of them dollar signs, it's safe to say that I'm cashed
Eric up in the back
Sik ridin' that shotgun
Bones grippin' that woodgrain
Even red lights couldn't stop Yung
I'm gone
