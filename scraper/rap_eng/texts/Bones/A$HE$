[Intro]

We're gathered here today
Not to mourn, but to celebrate
Ashes to ashes
Blunts to blunts
SESH

[Verse]

All black Glock 10 locked in the cockpit
Windows up white punk guttin' blunts
It's t-h-@ sign BT if flatline
Dip that cell gate and the flow will give 'em flat ties
Never got rat ties
Shit is just a satire
Never been to church what the fuck is a rabbi
Been the kid since 13, I always hate to say I'm that guy
Get that high speak mad rhymes you gotta heavy flow that's a fat lie
I can picture you when you write
Play a beat, say some things
And write 'em down like that rhymes
You a fuckin' joke like hehe
Lol, brb, gotta kill the blunt, RIP
Ash to ash
Blunt to blunt
People live to sesh
I sesh to love huh
