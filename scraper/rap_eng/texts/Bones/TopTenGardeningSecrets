[Verse]
Throwing seeds in the flower bed like three hours in
I been tending before seven left the dream that I was in
Swear on SESH since I was ten, I been fixed to make amends
With the world I felt would hold me back until the very end
I get it I feel it my mind it has no limits
I'm spread across the universe in a million tiny pieces
I'm pixelated thinking while I'm element table drinking
Know these chemicals I'm meddling with will surely be the end of me
I know I see but I cannot change I'm embedded in my ways
I cannot disconnect these waves
I am the puppet master that never cut the strings
Hanging forever this life is just not what it seems
Riding in a chariot made of other things
Apple turn to buggy roaches turn to human beings
Fireflies turn to lamps field mice turn to horses
Pull my carriage up let me out now I'm nauseous
How could I have ever foretold this?

[Hook]
Two blades on my lap, twin blunts to the neck
I'm the burden on your back, headstone say SESH
Two blades on my lap, twin blunts to the neck
I'm the burden on your back headstone say SESH
Bones
