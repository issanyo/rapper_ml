[Intro]
Sesh

[Hook]
Your shit is terrible, shut the fuck up
Talking that back but you never get buck
Say that you out here, bitch you get no love
Yappin' 'bout stacking but know it’s not much

[Verse 1]
Fucking with me and all my brothers is curtains
Time to show you what it's like to be worthless
Welcome to my little slice of the journey
Out this cold life, me I call it a burden
Let me burn, let me burn, fuck an urn
Sprinkle me to earth, let me blend with the dirt
Biodegradable, I am the fable
The myth from the sticks, pale witch, cold razor
Trying your best to adapt to the fact
That you're stuck in the trap and there's no turning back
Now you just wanna go home
But you'll never get there, you just woke Bones
I be where the black mold grow

[Hook]
Your shit is terrible, shut the fuck up
Talking that back but you never get buck
Say that you out here, bitch you get no love
Yappin' bout stacking but know it’s not much

[Outro]
I don't wanna know your name (fuck it)
Everytime you see the team (you duck us)
I don't wanna know your name (fuck it)
Everytime you see the team (you duck us)
