[Verse]

I be at the thrift shop if you need to find me
2 fools gold chains matchin' like siamese
5 dollar shirt and a 7 dollar time piece
Time just flies when you livin' like I be
I be at the thrift shop lookin' for a wrist watch
Somethin' from the 30's, if not it's just pish posh
Lookin' for that vintage
Flow old fashion
Old briefcase for the times that I'm travelin'
No backpackin', just knapsackin'
Young dumbfuck in the back blunt wrappin'
Team so dapper, kid so sharp
Camera adores me, young Robert Culp

[Hook]
I'm lookin' like the man and I'm feelin' like it too
In my thrift shop rags fuck your hundred dollar shoes
I'm lookin' like the man and I'm feelin' like it too
In my thrift shop rags fuck your hundred dollar suit

[Outro}
I be at the thrift shop if you need to find me
2 fools gold chains matchin' like siamese
5 dollar shirt and a 7 dollar time piece
Time just flies when you livin' like I be
