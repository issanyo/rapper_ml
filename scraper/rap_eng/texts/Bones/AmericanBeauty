[Intro: Lester Burnham]
I guess I could be pretty pissed off about
What happened to me
But it’s hard to stay mad
When there’s so much beauty in the world
Sometimes I feel like I’m seeing it all at once
And it’s too much;
My heart fills up like a balloon
That’s about to burst
And then I remember to relax
And stop trying to hold onto it
And then it flows through me like rain
And I can’t feel anything but gratitude —
For every single moment of my stupid, little life

[Verse 1]
Got that dope and I got that flow
Anything change, still the same ol' Bones
Somewhere in the dark is a boy you know
If you know me I don't talk 'til the blunt gets smoked
Thugs from the front to the back, let's go
Jam like a white vintage Les Paul
Tear 'ya club down and watch it in slo-mo
Then I ash on the wreckage and I'm walkin' out the door like

[Hook]
Boom (Boom)
Put it in the hoop like slam (slam)
Hear the crowd screamin' our jam (jam)
Bones too cold that's a fact (what?)
And that's how I beat Shaq
Boom (Boom)
Put it in the hoop like slam (slam)
Hear the crowd screamin' our jam (jam)
Bones too cold that's a fact (what?)
And that's how I beat Shaq

[Verse 2]
Wakin' in my room like a quarter to 8
Wonderin' what I'll do to kill the world today
Then I roll my first bone, then I'm into shape, knowin' damn well I'ma make my ends today
I ain't worried 'bout makin' no friends today
If you see it as a problem come and instigate
If you know me you don't wanna make this mistake
See I was bred to hate and I was built to break
Talk like this, try to walk like this
Say my shit don't bang, then you bite that shit
Rewrite that shit, change a couple of the words
That's your whole mixtape down to the core
Sorry
Didn't mean to do it to 'em
Since '94, all I do is do it to 'em
All I see on the radar is me
Me and my brothers, that's Sesh 'til I leave
