[Verse]
My emotions M.I.A (M.I.A)
Numb to the brain (Brain)
Lungs feel the same (Same)
Read it in my face (Face)
What the fuck's a lane? (Lane)
I’ll go any way (Way)
You are doomed to stay
Right where you at bitch know your place
This the type of wealth you can't fit up in a safe
F250 watch me crush your wraith
Gravedigger my blade itching
Like a beauty blender let me touch up your face
You lookin' aged you sounding stressed
Say it’s just life I say it's just SESH
Got 'em impressed got 'em upset
Come for my brothers I aim for your neck

[Bridge]
Ain't no turning back you stuck in deadman's land
I got no regrets thats something you can't say you have

[Chorus]
Cold soil warm blood watch it, watch it mix together
Sunny now it's storming watch me, watch me change the weather
Cold soil warm blood watch it, watch it mix together
Sunny now it’s storming watch me, watch me change the weather
Cold soil warm blood watch it, watch it mix together
Sunny now it’s storming watch me, watch me change the weather
Cold soil warm blood watch it, watch it mix together
Sunny now it's storming watch me, watch me change the weather

[Outro]
Yeah, SESH, Bones, bitch, yeah, what?
