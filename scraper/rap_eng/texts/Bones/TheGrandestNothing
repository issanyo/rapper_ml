[Verse]
No good for my health, not good to myself, I am no use to anyone
Rip my eyes out, throw them down, once they hit the ground no seeing you now
Now I can only trust my reaction, gotta learn to walk without ending up in traffic
Lights off just staring at the wall, cut to me, lights on, just nobody home
I'm shaking, I'm panicking, seconds I'll never get back
'Cause I throw 'em away like some evidence
Ready for reckoning, smoking, no questioning
Juice in the mason, make calls like I'm checking in
Look at the burial, see the resemblance
Between myself and the ones who I've ended
Hope it's to me that they pay no attention
Shoo 'em away to my dungeon I vanish
Deadboy, I could never ever stop, no
Yelling underground but you making pop songs
I could lie and say you got something going on
But since day one, bitch, you got it all wrong
Always living in contrast and trying to compare
Wish they could feel okay in the skin they wear

[Hook]
Stomp you in some shoes I ain't drop yet
Eyes drop to the floor, I'm a hot mess
I scream into the night like stop this
Every time I do some shit I'm like let's drop this
Stomp you in some shoes I ain't drop yet
Eyes drop to the floor, I'm a hot mess
I scream into the night like stop this
Every time I do some shit I'm like let's drop this
Stomp you in some shoes I ain't drop yet
Eyes drop to the floor, I'm a hot mess
I scream into the night like stop this
(Every time I do some shit I'm like let's drop this)
