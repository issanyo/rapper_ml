[Verse]
Young Val Venis
Hello Ladies
Hair slicked back
Switchblade by my ankle
Young fucking greaser, Flow Ponyboy
Stay golden is what they told me now I'm golden
I've been never holdin'
Funny like Uncle Joey
Pretty like Uncle Jesse
Kill it with Pleasure Tony
Been in I've never folding
I'm real I'm never phony
A million dollars on the line you know I'm never phonin'
You motherfucker getting gloom motherfucker
I'm cool motherfucker
I'm sick of it
I'm relevant speaking flows for the hell of it
You rap just to be selling it
Should be a felony felon just some fellas with Sâ€™s up on our sweaters you jealous


[Hook]
You know we high when you see us
You know we SESH when you smell us
