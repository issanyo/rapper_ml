[Hook x2]
Ghetto birds flying, brotha's stay robbin'
Hand on the wheel, one hand on the nine
Sons gon' die, mothers gon' cry
Just another day in the mutha'fuckin' life

[Verse 1]
It's the Rolex rockin', 64 hoppin'
Pimp named Bones, always flowin', never stoppin'
House shoes walkin', Backwoods sparkin'
If the conversation ain't 'bout money we ain't talkin'
Dice shakin', trunk stay quakin'
Chevrolet jumpin' on a hundred spoke Daytons
Bars on the window, blowing on some Indo
Kids stay inside, go and play your Nintendo
Life ain't safe and the streets ain't neither
Busta' tried to check so I had to bring em' either
Snuff em, Dump em, underneath the freeway
Body get to rottin', had to handle it the G way
Sesh, what I rep, Until I rest
Got a Kevlar vest 'case shots get sent
I'm somewhere on the block just posted
Press me with that heater, you gon' get your ass toasted

[Hook x2]
