[Verse]

Just a bad motherfucker with a chip on his shoulder
Slow-mo like holder
Lemme bring that back lemme boom that bat that's a playstation controller
I got GTA on my screen
She sees me when she dreams
I'm livin' what I used to dream about when I lived at home at 13
I'm smokin' out of my window
Backroads we hit low
Flashbacks to the days on the bus playin' Nintendo
That's hide n' seek, don't you peak
Million blunts I'll be gone in a week
Sleep in the grave, live in the yard
Pimp named Bones comin' down real hard

[Hook]

Cadillac cars on black tints
Tape in the deck playin' [?]
Tall white tee brand new shoes
Cigar full of drugs put me in a good mood
Good mood, put me in a good mood
Cigar full of drugs put me in a good mood
