[Intro]
— Like this?
— Yes

[Chorus]
My biggest enemy's always been myself
It's always been myself, it's always
My biggest enemy's always been myself
It's always been myself, it's always
My biggest enemy's always been myself
It's always been myself, it's always
My biggest enemy's always been myself
My biggest enemy's always been myself
Who do I have to thank?
No one

[Outro]
— Like this?
— Yes!
