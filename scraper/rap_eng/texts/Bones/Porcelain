[Verse]
Riding in the limousine watching rocket power
Time moving slow, a million blunts a hundred hours
All the windows down rolling wraps full of flowers
I light the match, I light the end
Smoke it like my Prowler
Murals on the wall
Stained glass ceilings
Marble floor walking
Making money for my children
Statues made of me, in the living room
Water fountains full of syrup
Spitting neck full of jewels

[Hook] 4x
I'm getting high
I'm laying low
I'm rolling up my blunts

I'm getting high
I'm laying low
I'm Kreepin in the Kut
