[Verse]
Wake up, go to sleep, repeat infinite (infinite)
Forever talking with nobody listening (listening)
One day I will wake up and see things are different (different)
Hopes by the plenty, I don't get 'em, no difference (difference)
I've been trying my best and I still can't shake it
I've been trying my hardest I've never really
Been too good at changing
Been too good at changing
Been too good at changing
