[Hook]
I gotta know, bitch, I be lurking outside your door, wait, wait
I gotta go, 24/7 live on the low, wait, wait
I gotta know, bitch, I be lurking outside your door, wait, wait
I gotta go, 24/7 live on the low, wait, wait

[Verse]
Match in the gas tank, bitch, boom boom
I was left in the bath, froze lips turning blue
Who knew screw loose fall and make a new noose
Scale the highest shit around, smoke and jump like Footloose (ah)
I ain't talkin medicine when I say I got the juice (ah)
Cold pressed every day, I'm sipping and peeling fruit(ah)
It's funny how they all the same, you say it, they said it too (ah)
I would surely be at peace if I just give my mind the mute (what?)
Shut both my eyes, lay my head back (back)
Envision nothing but forests that still intact (-tact)
I see a place with no pavement, I right click save it
No painter could ever paint it, no scholar could ever say it (what?)

[Bridge]
Ready to, ready to go now, please just let me know (ah)
Ready to, ready to go now, please just let me know
Ready to, ready to go now, please just let me know
(I can't take another day, I can't take another day)
Ready to, ready to go now, please just let me know
(I can't take another day, I can't take another day)
(ah) Ready to, ready to go now, please just let me know (ah)
Ready to, ready to go now, please just let me know (ah)
Ready to, ready to go now, please just let me know (ah)
(I can't take another day, I can't take another day)
Ready to, ready to go now, please just let me know (ah)
(I can't take another day, I can't take another day)
I don't know what you been thinking
I been doing lots of that
I been doing lots of that
I been doing lots of that
I been doing lots of that
I been doing lots of that

[Hook]
What?
I gotta know, bitch, I be lurking outside your door, wait, wait
I gotta go, 24/7 live on the low, wait, wait
I gotta know, bitch, I be lurking outside your door, wait, wait
I gotta go, 24/7 live on the low, wait, wait
