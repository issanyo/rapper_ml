[Verse 1]
Lava lamp by the stairs, glowin' while I show you care
I've been here and I've been there but next to you's my favorite here
I don't need choppers and jets to reach the high I ain't been yet
Cause I know that time will tell and so far it's been speaking clear
So far this year's been a good year, so far today's been a good day
I bet tonight's gonna be the same but you never know, so enjoy the breeze
Watch the sky turn and die, flip tonight and tell me why
You choose to focus on some lies that eat your brain, heart and insides
You don't need it, you don't need it, push 'em away
I don't wanna go too far and sink, my hates all flow in my brain
Because it only comes in doses, it ain't truly like the ocean
You show me there's more to life and I hold you and forget I'm hopeless

[Outro]
You are everything
I need you forever, forever, forever
I need you forever, forever, forever
