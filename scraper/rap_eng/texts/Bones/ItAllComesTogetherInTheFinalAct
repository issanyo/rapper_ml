[Verse 1]
Stand up straight just like a man
Be counted with all the rest
Work real hard and graduate
You need a well deserved good rest
Find a job and find a mate
Settle down in a house in the suburbs
These are dreams they gave to you
I can feel when they're not yours
My skin peels like wallpaper
In the house that we don't go to anymore

[Verse 2]
Feelings are far too radical
To ever see eye to eye
A mother's son was killed today
Only what she knows is why
Beheaded by hands of so-called faith
Maybe for a chance to live in the sky
Whatever the goal and point they saw it
I don't think that was the way to go about it
They don't see a way around it

[Outro]
Finally, I've come home, slipping off my shoes
Into a land that brings such safety to me
