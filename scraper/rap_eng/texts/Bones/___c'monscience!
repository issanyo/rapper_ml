[Intro]


[Man]
Okay, now
I don't know whether if you are able to do this in class
But this is kind of fun to do
What you do is get a piece of cardboard
Let me turn the lights back on again
Because I want you to understand I gonna turn out one of the light bulbs you tell me which one


[Verse]
Remember the times when we used to ride around woah woah
Remember the times that we stopped it from hitting the ground
Till I turned 16 and said I'm getting locked up

[Man]
Oh okay well what are we gonna do now

[Kid]
Well, oh bonus that might give me a extra point
Oh great

[Man]
Well what's the whole point of this thing

[Kid]
Well you see what happens is you're trying to get points

[Man]
I see

[Kid]
He got it
Oh no you're ahead of me now
I'm gonna have to get a good science one cause I'm good at those
C'mon Science


[Outro]

Do you see how much fun it is to play
