[Verse: Bones]
Over the hills, we go
Oh but the times we'll have
When we don't know where we are
I'm waiting for a sign
I hope you give me something to work with

[Outro: Ian Hooper]
Cause I'm lost in a city on the west side
And you've got me cryin' out
Oh you left me
And I'm looking for a reason why
