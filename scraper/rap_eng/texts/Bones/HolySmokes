[Verse 1]
Earth so fucked up, got me so fucked up, so I stay fucked up too
Gotta be on level playin' field when you takin' on the elephant in the room
The food is poison, don't drink the water
We are all pigs in a massive slaughter
Soon we will see what it means to tarnish
Winters gettin' colder, every summer gettin' hotter
Sweatin' underneath the rays, rollin' up watchin' the world end
Best seat in the house reserved for SESH, now start the whirlwind
Debris fallin', sirens callin' out to the world, no signs of stoppin'
Baller blockin', you get locked in a box to keep inside my pocket
Tell me please what's the word now
Everyone hopin' I slow it down
Fuck is up, you know it's goin' down
Feel like Yung Joc when I'm up in your town
Saw what you built and I burnt it down
Funny how smoke is a calming sound
The sizzle of nothing that once was a something
The transfer of matter turn you to a cloud

[Hook]
Smoked
Rob your dreams and kill your hope, now you smoked
On the curb, like a joke, bitches know
What it do and what it don't, yeah it's Bones

[Outro]
SESH
Smoked
Rob your dreams and kill your hope, now you smoked
On the curb, like a joke, bitches know
What do and what it don't, yeah it's Bones
Smoked
