[Verse]
Walkin' down the dirt roads, fingers intertwined
Let's get lost together, fingers crossed they'll never find us
Lying on our backs in the summer grass
We were thirteen, time's movin' way too fast
Thought we knew it all, I was so sure I did
I want to die without you, you make me want to live
I want to know
Will you hold me close
