[Intro]
"Halo makes natural beauty the first time that you use it
You need no special rinsing after you use it
So Halo everybody, Halo
Halo shampoo, Halo
Halo everybody, Halo is the shampoo that glorifies your hair
So I love shampoo Halo"

[Verse]
Everytime I fall for you I know deep inside you'll fall for me too
Anytime you call my name, I will be right here waiting for you
Everytime I fall for you I know deep inside you'll fall for me too
Anytime you call my name, I will be right here waiting for you
I'm waiting for you, girl
Waiting for you to come home
I will be right, I will be right, I will be right here waiting, get here tonight
