See my flow is nasty, ya'lls is so polished
Your whole sound's bullshit and mine's just honest
I dropped out with plans, ya'll planned for college
It's almost been a year and you still haven't got shit
Be honest, you already lost us
Remember all the times that I told you "I got this?"
Well, how can I put this kindly?
In your face, mother fucker, I told you "don't try me"
Now, I got all these songs in the chamber
And go aim, click clack, erase ya
Send you back to another dimension
My raps is in your vision
My verses is in your kitchen
Waiting to be dissected and cooked for more revision

I'm the main ingredient
