[Verse: Bones]
Baby blue velour suits whenever I slide through
It's 2002 riding in the Lex coupe
Young jagged ash coming down parachutes
Where the party at?
Do-rag, orange suits
30-inch rims when I pull up expeditious
Bought a gold steering wheel
It's just what I was missing
Ultraviolet lights makes the whole night glisten
When you spittin' those writtens
It sounds like nothin that I'm in to
And she say the fuckin same
She say my fucking name
We ain't lovin we ain't fuckin
We just starting up a flame
Cigars full of drugs crystal champagne
Ace's on my feet AI when I play
Silk by my bones
Hoes leave me 'lone
Call the fuckin phone and they get the dial tone
I'm gettin my shine on
I'm turning your shit off
I'm turning your life down
I'm turning my shit up
When I'm riding down the street, GTA 3
White skin, black pump
Pop pop, let em bleed
Big pinky ring and it sing bling bling
My wrist chime in while my chain shine in

[Outro]
Look
This uh, d0-rag underneath the headband type shit
That Foo Boo velour
Yeah, all white forces ride around
Got the 112 CD in
Peaches and cream
Ride, sesh
Hmm, that's nice
That is nice
