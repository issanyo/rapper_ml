[Verse 1]
On my knees in the night, seeing prayers in the street
Fuck that, fuck god, all I fucking need is me
I be tripping on the beat, bitch, tripping on your feet
I've be flowing all day, now all of my clothes free
Young white mac riding in the 'lac
Mac on his lap and his fucking seat back
Fucking seats black, dope look white
Powder on the dash, one line in the fire

[Hook]
I'm blown, blown, out of control
Guns off safety, triggers getting pulled
Blown, blown, out of control
Guns off safety, triggers getting pulled

[Verse 2]
Going, going ghost, swinging up the coast
Lighter in my right, in the other bag of dope
Life through the scope, death by the bullet
I see you on the range, don't make me fucking pull it
I inhale the beat, I exhale the flow
I live for this shit and I got just to know
That I am the best, the beast in the flesh
6 foot, 3 fools gold on his neck

[Hook]
I'm blown, blown, out of control
Guns off safety, triggers getting pulled
Blown, blown, out of control
Guns off safety, triggers getting pulled
