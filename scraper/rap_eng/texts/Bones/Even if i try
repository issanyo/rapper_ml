Verse:

What?

That's how it is
Every day in every way (way)
That's how it is
Bitch I was lying when I said (said)
That's just how it's been
It never seems we've had the means (what?)
Of becoming friends
Though we're quick to take our life away (wait)

Chorus:

Even if I try
Even if I try
I could never care, even if I try
I could never care, even if I try

I could never care, even if I try
I could never care, even if I try
I could never care, even if I try
I could never care
Even if I try, even if I try
Even if I try
Yeah

If I try, I'll fall right down, and I'll go on my way

End Dialogue (Bones) :
I gotta say man, that's a pretty substantial piece, so, you know
I know I'm your friend and all, and I'm not trying to, like
Push you in the, you know
One way or the other, but
These are chrome LED trucknuts
We've been looking all over for these
