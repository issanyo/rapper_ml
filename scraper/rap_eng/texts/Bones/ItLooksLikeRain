[Verse: Bones]
They look me in my face and said "it look like rain"
Took a step closer then they all just backed away
Looked at my hands and thought maybe I'm not the same
I felt a certain way
Because I felt Cronus with the pain
Divisions of atoms, I stand up phasing they shadow
I'm used to not being liked by others
Separation don't matter
This shit a blank slate book,so I just fill in the chatter
If every seconds just a step,I shall ascend up the latter
Still we rolling and smoking that back to back
While you photoshop backwood packs
In all of your pictures
With water dripping
This shit is bewildering,do what we doin'
Realize a world that our pressure put children in
I just look on when I see someone doin' it
Last night I laid awake as usual at night talking to me
Bones I don't wanna lose you
Artichoke hearts,makin' salad in the dark
Queue the lights and I'm gone,just a ball up on the floor
Porcelain carrots stuffed to the brim with some classics
TeamSESH burning to the glasses, white granite tray for my ashes
Your motivations the money,you say them dolla's your diet
I'd OD on the time that I'm giving making money's just a side affect
Everyday I open eyes and I see just what I want
Let an old dog teach how to make the fucking cut
Did it land? Have mounts
Whatever the fuck you please
Make this place just what you want
And spend the rest of your days in peace
