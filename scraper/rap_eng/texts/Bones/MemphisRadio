Don't be acting clever
You might end up in an ambulance
Stuck [?]
Never leave and never dance
Ridin in that caravan
Holdin onto hella clips
Bout' to let em go
Whaddya know?
I'm on my devil shit
Cookin up some evil shit
Schemin on that Memphis shit
Long distance calls, over the phone
That's just my Memphis bitch
Roll my blunts delicate
Drugs in my system now
Always turn my system up
Never turn my system down
Bangin on the curbs
Ridin round with my fuckin team
Chevy with the bucket seats
Feelin like it's 93'
No [?] in my deck
Let them sneakers bleed
Posted with my evil deeds
To let my fuckin demons feed

[Outro:]
What
Yeah
Sesh
What
