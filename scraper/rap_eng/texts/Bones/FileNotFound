[Intro]
"I ain’t no spring chicken, I don’t have to tell you that
I’ve been sitting in this same, damn, casino all my life
Listening to all those bells going off for everybody else, but nothing ever hits on my machine, not even once
I’m still sitting there with the same drink in my hand, good old American dream"

[Verse]
I fall down, and then, I get up again
I don't know when it ends, I don't know if it will
I just hope that it's all, all part of the thrill
'Cause my heart is beating fast and I don't think I can breathe
Can't breathe

[Hook]
Where do your happy thoughts go when you need them
Where do your happy thoughts go when you need them

[Bridge]
I'm running out of words to say
I hope that you'll work with me and wait for it
I think I'm getting better now
It's all coming back to me

[Hook]
Where do your happy thoughts go when you can't find them
Where do your happy thoughts go when you need

[Outro]
I'm running out of words to say
I hope that you'll work with me and wait for it
