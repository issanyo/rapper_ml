[Verse]
I was born in a place, where they killed themselves before they raised
Their own children, their own little them
All of the flaws, wrapped into one
You made me, are you proud of what you made?

[Hook]
All I need
All I need
It's sad cause you can't
Call for me no more (I just can't)
Let it all just go
Let it all just go
Let it all just go
Let it all just go
