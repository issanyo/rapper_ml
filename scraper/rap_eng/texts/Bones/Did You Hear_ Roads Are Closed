[Intro: Xavier Wulf & Bones]
Ay, ice

I'm still stone cold froze
(I'm still stone cold froze)
I'm still stone cold cold
(I'm still stone cold cold)

[Hook: Xavier Wulf]
All my ice is on, I'm still ice stone cold ay
All my ice is on, I'm still ice stone cold ay
All my ice is on, I'm still stone cold froze
The summer time she still think I'm ice stone frozen (aye)
All my ice is on, I'm still ice stone cold ay
All my ice is on, I'm still ice stone cold ay
All my ice is on, I'm still stone cold froze
The summer time she still think I'm ice stone frozen (aye)

[Verse: Bones]
Bitch, we drop the weather make it go, go, go
You say that they fuck with you, they don't, oh no
Anytime we wanna do
We do everything we wanna do
We, we make the roads a little icier
They slide while we ride smoke straight in the air
We, we make the roads a little icier
They slide while we ride smoke straight in the air yeah
