[Intro]

I ain't gonna stop you, you can do just what you want
You know where to find me if you ever need some drugs
Rollin' up a blunt, smokin' wicked till the sun came up
And then we roll another one

[Verse 1]

I got these drugs in my veins, got these drugs in my veins
Every time i roll a blunt i just think about your face
Now these sheets gettin clothed
Every day after day i'm just tryna get rich so i can finally fuckin' say
Don't worry bout a thing you already know i got it
Condo in the valley got a trap house out in compton
Always done what i wanted, so why should this be different
Dropped out, moved away, got rich off spittin
I'm gettin' rich off my business, SESH raps in yo dispensaries
Neck drippin' in fake gold fuck all your accessories
Quit with all the peasantry, i give the beat the best of me
I break it down roll it up and pass whatever's left to me

[Hook]

I need you more than anything in my life
I want you more than anything in my life
I miss you more than anyone in my life
I love you more than anyone in my life
