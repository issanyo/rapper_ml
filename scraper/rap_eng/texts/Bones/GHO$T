[Hook: Bones]
I'm a muthafuckin' ghost, skin the color of coke
Same go for my flows, same go for my dope
Got your girl froze up, guess a kid too cold
Got a mouth full of chrome, so i spark when i flow

[Verse 1: Bones]
Bitch you already know, pullin up on fo's
30 blunts to the face, everything slow mo'
Everything slowed down, can't feel my legs no mo'
Hanging out the sun-roof yelling "Yo-Yo-Yo"
Sling shot on the floor, bag of rocks and the dope
Bouta load it, aim it, cock it back and just let it go
Let me flow, let me flow, motherfucker just let me go
White noise on your T.V. let you know you ain't alone

[Hook: Bones]
I'm a muthafuckin' ghost, skin the color of coke
Same go for my flows, same go for my dope
Got your girl froze up, guess a kid too cold
Got a mouth full of chrome, so i spark when i flow
I'm a muthafuckin' ghost, skin the color of coke
Same go for my flows, same go for my dope
Got your girl froze up, guess a kid too cold
Got a mouth full of chrome, so i spark when i flow
