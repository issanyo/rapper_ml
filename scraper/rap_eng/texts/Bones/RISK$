[Hook: P2THEGOLDMA$K]
You wanna be rich?
You gotta take Risks
Risks, Risks
You gotta take risks, risks
You gotta take risks, risks
You wanna be rich?
You gotta take risks

[Verse 1: P2THEGOLDMA$K]
You wanna be rich?
You gotta take Risk$
Hit the road for the low
With them pounds and bricks
You gotta stay strapped bitch niggas taking shit (No lackin')
Niggas hungry they need money I protect my shit (Strapped up)
When I was on my dick, you wasn't on my dick (Nah)
Now I'm on my shit, you all on my dick (Splash splash)
PMG my niggas flexing off the rip
Marbach legend bitch, trill nigga shit

[Verse 2: Chris Travis]
Bitch you know I'm taking risks, just by looking at my wrist
Two blunts in my mouth, burning til a nigga rich
THC in my piss, bitch I'm looking like a prince
Catch me dancing with the devil
Give him acid, watch him trip
Bitch I do this shit for real
Y'all do this shit for thrills
Nigga catch me in the mills
Smoking dope in the hills
Let my fucking mind heal
One nigga, one girl, two blunts, two pills
Fuck how you niggas feel

[Verse 3: Bones]
Blade, blade on hip if you tryna take a risk
It's a skinny white pimp, coming down in the V
Hundred smokes on the rims diamonds on my wrists
Gems on my pinky bling, blingin' like a bitch
Blunt guts on the floor
Blood up on the walls
Haunted house where I stay on the hill in the falls
Cop a stone when I walk
Bitch it's 1932
Silent films when I talk, black and white colored jewels
I'l be creepin slow, smokin fast
Rollin my dope and then I blow the ash
Hope it lasts but it never does
Sometimes it seems I'm never high enough
Creepin slow, smokin fast
Rollin my dope and then I blow the ash
Hope it lasts but it never does
Sometimes It feels I'm never high enough
If you wanna be rich you gotta take some risks
If you wanna get rich you gotta take some risks
