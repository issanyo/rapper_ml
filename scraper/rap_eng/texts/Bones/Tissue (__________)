[Verse 1]
Blunt wrap, rip like tissue (tissue)
I got way too many issues (bitch)
Bad thoughts drop like missiles
Geronimo, you know Bones gonna miss you (bye)
Sunny came home with a mission (mission)
I done tried to put 'em on nutrition (nutrition)
But the point was something that they was missing
I can scream it, but I promise these bitches they wouldn't listen
In the dark but somehow the grave still shining
Off in the cave with the bats reclining
Feet up on the rocks, ring flash like lighting
We the weathermen, change the weather, no lying
Shit don't ever get hard, it just get better
High before I get up, remember when I was fed up
Shit don't ever get hard, it just get better
High before I get up, remember when I was fed up with life
Like I was begging to die
Had synthetic in my lungs when we broke in the ride
Had money on my mind when the snow was on the ground
Silent night, no sound, back roads breakin down
Packin the blade, running away, every night the same
We got away, I was in pain, had to get away
Packin the blade, running away, every night the same
We got away, I was in pain, had to get away

[Outro]
More bang for your buck, had that thing up in the (fuck it)
More bang for your buck, had that thing up in the (bus)
More bang for your buck, had that thing up in the (SESH)
More bang for your buck, had that thing up in the truck
