[Verse]
As I speak, as I talk
I see your lies, I hear your thoughts
As we breathe, as we go
Down this road that we call hope
Take my hand, hold it tight
Never let go, no matter what I say
Forgive your son, forgive your life
I can't forgive myself tonight

[Outro]
My eyes shut tight as I'm runnin' for my life
My eyes shut tight as I'm runnin' for my life
