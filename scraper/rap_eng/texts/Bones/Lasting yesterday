[Verse 1: Bones]
Now they all wanna do it like
The way they always taught us wasn't right
I see through the missing lights
Pop up in the dark, glowing eyes with some glistening ice
One hand on your shoulder, I promise you ain't ever felt colder
One look at my face make a forest deep root grow legs and walk away

[3x]
Waiting, waiting, waiting it out

[Outro: Bones]
Every little thing you're telling me I wish I could
Think of the words to respond
But I can't
