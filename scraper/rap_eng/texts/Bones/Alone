[Verse 1: Bones]
Walk in the room and I change up the temperature there is nothing you can do now
They like to assume that they knew me from school but they only know shit that I do now
Only got what you given, I’m giving em’ plenty but I don’t say everything
Heard me speak some thoughts on the beat now they think they know anything
“You don’t know me” that’s a phrase that I hate cause they use it a lot
But we’ll just recept this from my recollection, my mind is shot

[Verse 2: Bones]
Fuck it now the hammer dropping
Humans shoot like panasonic
S’ everyday you crave this knowledge
Life’s a house I been demolished
Never public always private
I just live it fucking high
Blinds down, water cold
I’m the farthest in the row
I’m the one that’s gotta know
What’s the choice that lies ahead
Why you choose to make it slow
The answers right inside your head
Sayin’ fuck it, [?], tell you yes, tell you no
So don’t overthink the shit that place your mind in a hole
Touch my spine to the snow
Now the crystals on my back
In the cave with the best
Just uncovering the tracks
