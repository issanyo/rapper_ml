That's right, this has gotta be the greatest record of the year
(Oh really?)
Check it out

Huh! All you folks that's been waiting on me
Here I am, finally
Just look in the sky, look in the tree
I tell you who you see, it's Starksi
Gotta happy-happy story, can tell you all
And if you listen to me you'll have a ball
All you people around the nation
All I need is participation
Don't need no segregation
Don't want no revelation
See when I learn, when the world turn
Ain't nobody gets it, just you earn
So take your time but don't hesitate
Cause Lovebug Starski's not gonna wait
I'm often imitated but never duplicated
Cause my rap is so complicated
Now you look in the sky, look in the tree
Who do you see? (Starski!)
Who do you see? (Starski!)
Hip-hip-a-hop-snap-crackle-pop
Now everybody's doin' the rock-rock-rock
Just kick off your shoes, relax your socks
Because the Lovebug Starski is ready to rock
Snap-crackle-pop (Say what!)
Snap-crackle-pop yes yes y'all
Now if you can agree with me
I'm sure I can tell you what it's doin' for me
I got a Master's degree, a PhD
And I'm talkin' about [?]
I'm going down in history
It's the L-O-V-E-B-U-G (Love Bug Starski!)
So now you heard what it's doin' for me
You can do it too just wait and see
So ladies, ladies, stand in line
Be prepared to be one of mine
I [?] you, I [?] well
Me and you can have clientele
But I smell so nice with my cologne
And not a lady in the place can leave me alone
Cause I'm a man!

See I got something new just for you
Now if you're not too skinny you're not too fat
Everbody say how about that! (How about that!)
Yes yes y'all
Keep on, do what you like
Hey ladies, what's happenin'?
(Nobody can do it like the Starski can!)

Check out my bassman!

Alright, alright, alright, yeah, alright!

Whooo-weeee! Ha-ha-ha!

I come from the place that gives no pity
They call it, huh! New York City
Now I can't deny after years went by
I had to do or I had to die
Here I am in '81
I'm having fun and I'm not too dumb
Listen to me, I got something to say
You don't hear this every day
It's a new year, we call '81
So come on everybody let's have a little fun
Say '81! ('81!)
I'm having fun! (I'm having fun!)
I'ma do my best! (I'ma do my best!)
To past the test! (To past the test!)
The people of the world, it's just for you
If you understand me, I understand you
Straight to the point I'm gonna be the joint
With inspiration, body sensation
I'm gonna start a new creation
So plant me now and dig me later
Cause in '82 I'll be even greater
Hip-hip-a-hop-snap-crackle-pop
Come on everybody let's rock-rock-rock!

You see your attitude is up to you
Because you know what you wanna do
[?]
And then you'll see we'll pass the test
I know what I do and I do what I know
Now watch me people I'm not gonna blow
I say what I mean and I mean what I say
This I'll tell ya everyday
Positive life, that's what I'm about
Now watch me people while I turn it out
You have to give in order to get
And this I hope you never forget
You heard it before and you'll hear it again
Don't go to bed with a price on your head
Don't do the crime if you can't pay the time
So take my advice don't play with dice
When you see the price will be right
Hip-hip-a-hop-snap-crackle-pop
Come on everybody let's rock-rock-rock!

Drummer man!

[Break]

Hey my man!

Reality is what ya just heard
It's up to you to accept the words
Watchin' ya dance that's what I like
And with a smile that's twice as nice
You put your hand on your hip and let your backbone slip
Put the metal on the pedal, the heat in the beat
With a hip-hip-a-hop-snap-crackle-pop
Come on everybody let me see ya rock
Through rain, through shine or even a blizzard
Everybody knows that I'm the mic wizard
So catch that Starski spirit hah!
Can you dig it! Hah! Can you dig it!
It's the L-O-V-E-B-U-G
Rockin' in the rhythm and harmony
So on the count of three, give it to me
One, two, three give it to me!

Play it baby, play it!

I like it, I like it baby, I like it!

Say I'm good, say I'm good!

This has got to be the greatest
