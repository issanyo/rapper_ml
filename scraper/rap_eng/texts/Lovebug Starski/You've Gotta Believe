You've gotta believe!

You've gotta believe!

Well, I've been through times not so hot

I did the best with what I've got
I didn't let those things bother me
Believed in my own V.I.P
When things got bad, very slim
I didn't think that I could win
About to drown my troubles in the sea
But these words of wisdom came to me

You've gotta believe! (Don't let no one say you can't make it)

You've gotta believe! (When things go wrong just overtake it)

You've gotta believe! (Just tell yourself I've got to make it)

You've gotta believe! (So c'mon everybody, let's shake it!)

Suffering and misery from day to day
I kept my faith and I knew there was a way
To let those things be understood
Things that look bad can change to good
And if you want things bad enough
To be a winner you must stand tough
Cause quitters kick the bottom shelf
So just remember, believe in yourself!

You've gotta believe! (Don't let no one say you can't make it)

You've gotta believe! (When things go wrong just overtake it)

You've gotta believe! (Just tell yourself I've got to make it)

You've gotta believe! (So c'mon everybody, let's shake it!)

You've gotta believe!

Cause I'm looking forward to a better day
The Lord works in mysterious ways
I don't know what tomorrow will bring
I just hope that it'll change some things
The man upstairs, he has his plan
He won't give you more than you can stand
So when it looks like there's no other way
Just remember these words I say

You've gotta believe! (Don't let no one say you can't make it)

You've gotta believe! (When things go wrong just overtake it)

You've gotta believe! (Just tell yourself I've got to make it)

You've gotta believe! (So c'mon everybody, let's shake it!)
