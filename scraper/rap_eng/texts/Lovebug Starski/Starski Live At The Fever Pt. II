Here we go again

Well, hello everybody
How you been?
It's time to rock the Fever once again
The last time you heard me I made you a believer
At a place called Disco Fever

Now it's 10 o'clock, it's time to rock
The music's on and the doors unlocked
The ladies, the men, they stand in line
Just to hear Love Bug rock those rhymes
Now go "Bah ba ba ba bah bah bah bah"
(Bah ba ba ba bah bah bah bah!)
Everybody go bah ba ba ba bah bah bah bah
(Bah ba ba ba bah bah bah bah!)
Hey just throw your hands in the air, everybody
Throw your hands in the air a little higher
Say hooooo (Hooo!) Now scream (Oooooo!)
Now ladies listen up, don'tcha dare fight
You gotta be real to get what you want
Just get on the floor, stick to the script
Watch it baby doll and don'tcha dare slip
Cause I'm the captain of the ship, conductor of the train
Gonna let you know that I'm running things
Like ashes to ashes, dust to dust
If the Lord doesn't get you my music must
Ahhhhh!

Now ladies, all the ladies
Don'tcha dare act too shady
Just throw your hands in the air
All the ladies, throw your hands in the air
I wanna hear you say Oooooo! (Ooooo!)
Ooooooo! (Oooooo!)
Scream (Oooooooooooo!)
Love Bug! Starski!

Homeboys, this one's for you
If you're by yourself or with your crew
You gotta be strong to survive
So [?] my man, we're kickin' it live
One on one, we're gonna have some fun
Two on two, you know what to do
Tell me baby doll soul socialize
Clean out your ears and ya open your eyes
Kickin' it live at the place to be
It's the Fever my man and I'm Starski
Now homeboys, if you're feeling good say "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Let me hear you say "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Everybody go "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Let me hear you go "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Now freeze!

We're having fun!
