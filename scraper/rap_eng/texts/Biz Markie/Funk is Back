[Verse 1]
Get up out your seat, the grand groove is back
With a beat to sink your teeth in like Wolfman Jack
I'm bringing in the swing like ching a-ling a-ling
Guaranteed to rock and make the microphone sing
I combine funk with a make-a-monk piano
I'm nuts, I'm crazy, I lost it, and man a
Different type of bud in my veign and hey
Like I'm *cookoo cookoo* like a nappy dread
Now it's me, the B-I-Z, M-A-R K-I to the E
As you can see, going to the T-O-O, mo mo most definitely
I concoct to rock, and put you in shock
Not from the past, but I blact like Binac-a
Yeah, the one foots getting ill
Cause nobody beats the Biz still

[Hook]
The funk is back! (Repeat 4x)

[Verse 2]
Ooops, well I'm the original B-I-Z Mark
Here to let you know my bite is worse than my bark
I'm coiming out with some freakified funk
If Joanie was around, then I'd be a hump
But since she ain't, I still am the
Hellified king of the R-A-P
I'sa I'sa I'sa here to let you know
I'm the hypnotizing, mezmorizing, stealing the show
Uh-oh, I'm hitting hitting just like a speaker
My mom dropped the bomb, then God said "Eureka!"
To say a lay masterpiece that's long overdue
]From the streets of California to Kalamazoo
Don't look at me like I'm crazy or dumb
Cause my jinlge will tickle you cerebrum
My sensational delivery will give you a chill
That's why nobody beats the Biz still

[Hook]
The funk is back! (Repeat 4x)

[Verse 3]
I'm the super, duper, party pooper
With my loop I'll put you in a stupor
Chump, thump, with doctor's bump
With the trunks of funk to make the heartbeat pump
M ah Z R, K har, I har, E har
Try hard, a star, rocking the Casbah
My brain maintains with no restraints
Not John Doe or Jane, here to entertain
Feul a, deuler, plus an old schooler
Funk from the crack keep me kicking like I'm ruler
Dunky, drunky, skunky, funky, and pokey
Chunky, a junkie with the monkey on my back
Knack, opposites attract
Biz being wack? Get the bozack!
Skill to ill, plus always thrill
And I be sure that no one beats the Biz still

[Hook]
The funk is back! (Repeat 4x)

*the Biz goes off til the song's end*
