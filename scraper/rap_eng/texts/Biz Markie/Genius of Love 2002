[Female Voice]
I'm in heaven
Who you wit' baby?
With my boyfriend my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Time isn't present in that dimension
He'll take my arm
When we're walking, rolling and rocking
It's one time I'm glad I'm not a man
Feels like I'm dreaming but I'm not sleeping
(scratching)
Who needs a beat when your feet just go?
