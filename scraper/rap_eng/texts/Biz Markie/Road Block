Yo Doc, drop the beat in!

This is a incident that always occur
With the opposite sex, other word is her
No matter what nationality color or creed
Or wherever you at, there's always a bad seed
They're always talkin about wantin to be alone
You're spendin too much time witcha friends, all night long
I'm sayin yo what the heck, I am single
It's no reason why I shouldn't try to mingle
So I met this girl by the name of Maxine
Her breath didn't stink she used Listerine
She looked crazy a-ight, and the whole nine
But this situation was one of a kind
Because I wanted her.. all to my own
So I called her on, my Mickey Mouse telephone
I said, "Hello pretty momma it's the guy you just me
Uhh what are you doin tonight?"  She said, "Nuttin," I said, "Bet"
So when I went to pick her up, I was in shock
Cause she brought her friend along for a ROAD BLOCK

	[Biz sings]
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?
	Is it because I'm the BIZMARKIE?
	No I think it's because I have the R-A-P
	I think you think I'm UGLY makin CASH MONEY
	Yo I think all the girls is funny..
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?

(Yo Biz you know you don't usually be with things like that
Why you let her get away with that?)
I thought she was buggin just to see what I'd say
I said nuttin, let her friend come anyway
Okay now listen what she wanted me to for her friend
(What she want Biz?)  Expected me to pay her way in?
It's not like kid from stingy cheap or my name's Ebenezer
But I'm here to please Maxine, not to please her
So I still let it go by, and got her in the movie
Thank the Lord I bumped into my cousin named Cool V
I said please Vaughn, take her friend off my hands
So I can be alone, and get my man
He said alright I'll introduce, she act like she was wit it
But when we try to split, she looked and said forget it
I don't know whassup Vaughn, she must be buggin
I thought you was in the way she was kissin and huggin
Soon as I said - wanna make music like Sebastian Bach?
I'm not leavin my friend with a guy but it's another road block

	[Biz sings]
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Stay away from MEEEEEE!
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?
	Is it because I'm the BIZMARKIE?
	No I think it's because I can R-A-P, no
	I think you think I'm UGLY makin CASH MONEY
	All of this is funny..
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Stay away from MEEEEEE!
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Stay away from MEEEEEE!

So I was highly upset, and you would be too
If an icicle's in your way, stickin to you like glue
I mean it's the end of the night, time to move on
I'm tryin to kick ballistics so she'd come to my home
I went to, yo bust it, call her when you get to your crib
She said, no and started cryin like a baby with a bib
Now why you wanna bat me up and ruin my night?
I coulda said no but I was bein polite
She tried to pull the I'm stayin over her house bit
Not tonight baby you gon' be stayin at a Parkway Exit
So they went into the bathroom to get in a huddle
If you keep playin you're both gonna take the shuttle
They both came out the bathroom with a glance
Like the bathroom they were goin to dance
They both approached me with the look of a rock
I look and tell my senses ahh it's another road block..
