(Tex Armstrong)
It started with a smile, a rare rose in the concrete
Now the flower's growing garden
So innocent, which made me think i'm the best for her, a good influence
Shawty she a jiggy lil mami, she best dress
Cinderella pretty with the shoes how she flex
I'm attracted to her for her attractive ways
How she moves her hair from her face
I used to pray for better dayz till met her, so i had to approach
I went and got her some weed, ion get her a rose
I act a fool wit her, she getting entertained like comedy shows
Staring at them locious lips
Got me caught up a moment like the time froze
I'm the nigga for you not them other guys
I'm nuthing like this fuckboys and she recognise
We go together like Bonnie and Clyde
That's why i need you by my side

(Hook)
You, you got what i need
Can you be my valentine
Oh baby, you got what i need
Can you be my valentine

(Young Gstar)
Getting faded on a Friday
Wake up with my shorty on Saturday
Tell me how you want it girl
Fucking with a real type of guy
Crazy how them jeans hug your thighs
Come and take a ride on it
Pretty face, fat ass, no price on it
Rollin up my Mary Jane while she slide on it
And my baby hold it down
Killing all these other bitches round
Ain't fucking with no clowns
You fucking with Lil Fl√°vio
Got the kid sprung you won't catch me with another hoe
Love the way you smile though, why hide your face?
Know I'm pullin up, name a time and a place
Just part of the plan
Roll up, float high as we can
Cloudy ain't no telling where we land
Don't need no other man
Know I keep it litty on the side
You the one, hit me up baby be my valentines if u with it
