I was sittin home, all alone
When I heard the ring, on my telephone
I picked it up, to see who could it be
This girl I just met, her name was Tammy
See I was surprised, cause she called me first
She was one of the baddest in the universe
I was just buggin cause she gave me a ring
It was a Monday, and it started off with a bang
She start the conversation over how was your weekend
I did this that and the other with my friend Monique
And Shaneeda, (She need a new hairdo?) We both laughed
How you long you gonna be home?  I gotta take a bath
So I gave her two hours then I called her back
You know I was ready, when I rolled a headcrack
Cause when I asked, can I?  She cut me off so tough and
I gotta call you back - aww baby, you busy doin NUTTIN

Chorus: BizMarkie's crew and the Diabolical

Let me tell you a story bout a girl named Gilda
She was from out of state, I was wonderin will the
Same thing happen to me like the deja vu
Let me keep quiet, and go into a tale
See I was chillin at the Chapter 3
Word is bond she looked divine, she looked as fly as can be
I thought she was different cause she was by herself
She looked real wholesome, and in good physical health
I walked by, she said hi
Ain't you the B-I-Z-the-emmaza-emmaza-A-R-K-I
I said yes can I have the number to your home
Are you allowed to call Jersey on your phone?
She chuckled we exchanged, I went home joked about it
How she was gonna be mine, with no doubt about it
But everytime I call I say whassup muffin?
I'm doin somethin now - aww baby, you busy doin NUTTIN

Chorus

[BizMarkie]
Ahhhh, don't give me that!
The last episode was at a club in the Bronx
I was rockin with Capri who got a good response
It was Backspin June, and Limo Driver Mike
You chill in the car, cause clubs he didn't like
So me and V went in just to look around
Seein girls that had bass with sense around
Then we all got on stage and rocked the house
There were no fights in, not even out
Slide, then we got in the car
Saw two trillzadills shinin like a star
One was with Mike, the other was with June
Yo it's not gonna be theirs for soon
So V got with Mike and hooked me with her sister
If I knew she was like that, I woulda had dissed her
Cause everytime me and V called them both up and
They both were busy?!  Nah - they're busy doin NUTTIN

Chorus 3X

[BizMarkie - speaking over last 2X]
Ahhhh, don't even give me that!
That's junk
This goes out to all you bitches doin nuttin
Ka-ka-cause that's all you be doin
Am-am-I right B, am I right Doc
Am I right Shell, am I right V
Am I right am I right Sahai, am I right ?
They don't be busy doin NUTTIN
They go nowhere fast and then go backwards
With Bart Simpson in the background
All of a sudden roll like they got shot by the Apollo though
Word up, I didn't even.. okay
Bblabaldblablballl, ah!!
