Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
Well, let me tell you a story of my situation, I was talking to this girl from the U.S. Nation

[Rapped]
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage, drippin' pourin’ with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd, and guess who I met
I whispered in her hear, "Come to the picture booth
So I can ax you some questions, see if you're a hundred proof"
I axed her her name, she said "Blah blah blah"
She had nine-ten pants
(And a very big bra)
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said "How do you like the show?"
She said "I was very amused"
I started throwin’ bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kinda strange
Then when I asked "Do you have a man?" she tried to pretend
She said "No I don't, I only have a friend"

Come on!

Oh baby, you
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend
Oh baby, you
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought "Havin’ a friend couldn’t be no crime
'Cause I got friends, and that’s a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Jermaine and Jack"

Bu-but forget about that, let's go into the story
'Bout a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin’ familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so that we could build a
Relationship, or some understandin'
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time I called it seemed that somethin' was brewin'
I called on my dime, picked up, and called again
"Ayo, who was that?"
"Oh, he's just a friend"
[Laughing]
Oh no!

Oh baby, you
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend
Oh baby, you
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Spoken]
Damn, girl
What'chu want from me? I'll give you anything
You want any kind of subscription to a magazine?
Give you a potato
A mask of some sort
I love you

[Rapped]
So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day
I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to the gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
So I did and I was on my way
To see my baby girl, I was happy to say
I rolled up to her dormitory
"Yo, could ya' tell me where is door 3?"
He told me where it was, and for the moment
I didn't know that I was in for such an event
I went to her room
I opened the door
Oh snap!
Guess what I saw!
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in the mouth
I was so in shock, my heart went down south
Please listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend!

Oh baby, you
You got what I need, doo-wah
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend
Oh baby, you
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend
Oh baby, you...

Oh... Girl
