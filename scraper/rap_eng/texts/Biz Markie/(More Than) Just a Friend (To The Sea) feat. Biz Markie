[Verse 1: Biz Markie]
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But your seafaring passions just didn’t relate?
Let me tell ya a story ‘bout my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from a landlocked nation

The way that I met her was on the Twitter
She had misconceptions ‘bout life on water
I DM’d her straight, "Come down to the marina
So I can ask you some questions bout your nautical demeanor.”

I asked her sailing skill, she said “Land-lub-bah”
She had new boat shoes and a very big… car
Then when I asked, “Do ya have a fear," she tried to pretend
She said, "No I don’t, water’s my friend"

[Chorus 1: Together]
You, you got what I need but you’re saying you can’t swim
But you’re saying you can’t swim, oh baby
You, you wanna sail the seas, but boats you can’t comprehend
But boats you can’t comprehend, oh baby

[Verse 2: Biz Markie]
So I took Lub-bah over to talk to the Cap'n
I thought “here’s a commander who’ll make it happen”
Cause he’s trained crews and that’s a fact
Like Alfie, Brunie, and Sea Dog (the mack)

[Verse 2: Cap’n Crunch]
Before Sea Dog starts talkin’, gettin’ familiar
I want you to know that Biz and I feel your
Relationship with water. We’re understanding!
But teachin’ you to swim is what we are plannin’

[Verse 2: Biz Markie]
After this was established, everything was great
We chilled on the Guppy ‘til it got nice and late

[Verse 2: Cap'n Crunch]
I woke up this morning and opened the door
OH CRUNCH! Guess what I saw?
Biz Markie’s friend, turned to piracy
And ruling the waves from aboard the Guppy

[Verse 2: Biz Markie]
So please listen to the message that we send
Some people shouldn’t be taught to swim

[Chorus 2: Together]
She, she got what she needs and she took my ship from me
And she took my ship from me, oh baby
We, we don’t like piracy, we prefer to just be friends
We prefer to just be friends
