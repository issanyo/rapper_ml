Hey hey baby you've been on my mind I knew you for a long time
I've been thinking maybe that you should know
Hey hey baby can we compromise I really want you to be mine
I got a million places that we could go

I wanna be your everything
I wanna be the one you need
So tell me where ya been all my life
Gonna make you mine tonight

[2x]
Hey baby you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah you say you're just a friend

Hey hey baby we've been on the phone
Spending time together alone
But every time we talk the words don't come out right

Hey hey baby when I look in your eyes
I can tell you're holding something inside
I've been thinking bout you
I've been thinking bout me

I wanna be your everything
I wanna be the one you need
So tell me where ya been all my life
Gonna make you mine tonight

[2x]
Hey baby you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah you say you're just a friend


In carol city spent most of my nights
Tryna make the world whistle
It's the most of my life
How I made them all get low
Bring it back right around
Let the good times roll feeling good right now
But I remember Biz Markie
1989 or maybe 90
Came to me like a song I wrote
Cutting class
Chasing you cause you're all I want
Like you, you got what I need
And if not I'll just pretend
Until I can get your friend
I'm playing though
But maybe there's a little truth sprinkle in 'em
We be catching eyes and I can see the twinkle in 'em
Thought we'd be together until I seen the wrinkle in 'em
But I guess not

[4x]
Hey baby you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah you say you're just a friend
