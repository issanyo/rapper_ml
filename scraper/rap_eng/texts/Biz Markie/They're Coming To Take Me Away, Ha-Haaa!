[Intro: Verse 1]
Remember when they used to say
That there would be something blay
And said that my beat delay wouldn't work
Well
You walk right out the door
And see me practice more and more
Now it seems that i'm absurdably obsessed
That's why, they're coming to take me away
Ha-haaa!

[Hook]
They're coming to take me away
Ho-hoo!
He-hee!
Ha-haaa!
To the funny farm, where beats are stolen all the time
And whack em caesars stay around
As long I lay a thought
And show the men in the coats i'll be happy to go
They're comin' to take me away
Ho-hoo! He-hee! Ha-hahahaha!
Ho-hoo! Ha-hahaha!
Ha-hahaha!

[Verse 2]

I *Beatboxing beats* all day
It seems that times have taught me

Ha-hahahaha-haha
You have the dirt to tell me
I'm totally mad?
I don't know why

[Hook]
They're coming to take me away

And show the men in the coats i'll be happy to go
They're comin' to take me away
Ho-hoo! He-hee! Ha-hahahaha!
Ho-hoo! Ha-hahaha!
Ha-hahaha!

[Verse 3]
Why do you gotta take me away, man?
But every time they put me in
The room that makes you
Break
Now
All of those times you called me whack
My rhythms sections
They're all one track
The Bass, the stairs
The hots for all your needs
You just wait
I'll find it yet
I'll drive you nuts
They rhymes play beats
Well, I play cuts
That's why, they're

[Hook]
They're coming to take me away
Ho-hoo!

[Verse 4]
But when they come and take me away
They would put me in this room
That I just go crazy, and
Break
Now
Looney Toons, go down the hall
My beats don't ever patter off the wall
They try to put a jacket around my lips
Well
If you put me away, you're totally wrong
I'm not gonna do it, my bass is so strong
My highs will probably wind up breakin' glass
That's why, they're
