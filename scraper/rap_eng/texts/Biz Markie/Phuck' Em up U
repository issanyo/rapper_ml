Where my motherfuckin' man is now?
Yo Grand Daddy I.U man, you been telling niggas the whole album they can't fuck with you man, Yo check this shit out man, I'm certain them niggas can't fuck with you
Yo fuck them niggas up IU fuck them niggas up

[Grand Daddy I.U]

Grand Daddy is here three cheers for the fabulous
Vocabulous with the gift of gab
The kick hits, on a mix by kay cee
The cuts are tasty smooth as [?]
With the spice to entice the young ones
But update the jams the old folks sung one
We renovate and created a new hit
The shit sound great so how could you boo this
You gotta be crazy or either on dope or dust
Try to fuck with us.. You get bust
I'm on a mission to serve all opposition
Any competition that try to take my position
There's no half's hops so call the cops
Tells your moms and pops
Bt still you get no props
I kick styles the crowd can distinguish, rapping [?]
[?]
Yes i'm the best and this I insist on
Girls i kiss on, suckers I piss on and violators get choked with the mic chord
Tripped and whipped and shipped straight to the psych ward
Be who you supposed to be
Because you chose to be
Another booty emcee opposing me
Can't match the talent or equal the skill when its time to get violent I dont fight I kill
You whack ass, jack-ass
Smoke a dime of crack ass
Booty emcees, kiss my black ass
And when you think you saying something slick
I put emcees on their knees and tell em suck my dick

It's steady flow and the grand daddy
It's steady flow and I'm the grand daddy y'all
And easy rick is in the house
And DJ Kay cee is in the house
And  [?] is in the hous
And DJ [?] is in the house
To my man Cool V he's in the house
And [?] My man Snake from the [?]
And you dont stop, you dont stop
And [?] is in the house
And Biz Markie is in the house
And Pimpstead is in the house
And the Grand Daddy U col' turn shit out y'all
Peace

[Steady Flow]

Oh my motherfucking god!!
I told you niggas you can't fuck with him now what?
Fuck that!!! Fuck that!!!!
