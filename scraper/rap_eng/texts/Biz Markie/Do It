[Biz Markie]

Do it, ahh, let's do it
Ahh, let's do it, ahh, let's do it
Ahh, let's do it, ahh, let's do it
Ahh, let's do it with the disco fluid

[Mike D]

Well, Like the blackbyrds I'm a do it fluid
Building rhymes like buildings, like a stonehenge druid
Step up and get enlightened, educating my mind
I play the tape forward, it's not time to rewind

[MCA]

Step inside the motherfucker and I get my flow on
Amalgamating styles so I've got something to grow on
Seasons change when it comes their time
Fall brings the winter (yeah) and on back to springtime

[Ad-Rock]

Well, it's the King Ad-Rock and that's who I am
Listen all of y'all I'm not the Son of Sam
Cause I'm thin and I don't grin
But check it out people cause I loves to go and swim

[Mike D]

Caught up on the phone, fiber optic distraction
Information super highway got the brain contraction
I'm the Kung Fu master vs. The Sumo wrestler
Got the beats in Manhattan you can hear in Westchester

[MCA]

Well, my mother was born out in Coney Island
Raised on the LES, Manhattan Island
My dad came out from Detroit and they had me
And then back through Ellis Island goes (yeah) the family tree

[Ad-Rock]

Well, I'm a six point seven on the Richter Scale
I've got rhymes gallore and then I never fail
Like gravy to potatoes, Luke to Darth Vader(s)
I'm a souped-up sucker and I'll see you all later

[Biz Markie]

Let's do it, ahh, let's do it
Ahh, let's do it, do it, do it, do it
Ahh, let's do it, ahh, let's do it
Ahh, let's do it, do it, do it, do it

[Mike D]

You see me comin' down the block with the funky cuts
You say, ("Hey, Mike D") and I say, "Mic deez nuts"
I've got attractions like I'm Elvis Costello
Adam Yauch you grab the mic cause you know you're my mellow

[MCA]

Well, when I get it into the zone
I'm gonna take it to a place where I'm all alone
Well when I got my shit ah-with my rhyme style's kicking
My brain is flowing honest like Abe Lincoln

[Ad-Rock]

Cause I'm the fuckin' rhythm ace with the rhyme selection
Listen all y'all, I rap with perfection
Because I got the motherfuckin' old school flavor
That you savor, so watch your behavior

[Mike D]

Talking other dimensions, levels higher
Why did Billy Joel say, "We Didn't Start the Fire"
Take you to another realm, ugh, another level
I've got the funky rhymes but I'm not the funky devil

[MCA]

I step from minute to minute, lifetime to lifetime
Step from stage to stage to see it all unwind
Slowly but surely I seek to find my mind
And every wall that I face is of my own design

[Ad-Rock]

YEAH Glendale Boulevard... ah boulevard
Glendale Boulevard is where I'm at
It's where I'm at, where I live
Check it Check it out cause my head is like a sieve
And yo we turn it out


[Biz Markie]

Do it, let's do it
With your mind, put your body into it
Let's do it, let's do it
With your mind, put your body into it
Let's do it, let's do it
With your mind, put your body into it
Let's do it

A'ight! We got the funk
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
We got the funk
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
What the, we got the f-f-funk
Rrrrr!!

We got the funk
We got the funk
