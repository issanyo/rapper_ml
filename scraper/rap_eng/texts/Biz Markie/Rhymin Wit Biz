[Intro: Biz Markie ]
Funky, funky, OWWWWW!
One, two doing em all won't do
Got my man Erick Sermon in the house
Can't forget my man Keith Murray in the house
Got Redman in the house
Def Squad is in the house
And huh huh I an huh huh huh ha the Biz Markie
Doo dee doo, guaranteed to rhyme for you and you
I say yes yes y'all to the beat yall
Party having people guaranteed to be like having a ball
Hey hey hey
We gonna do a little something like this I say

[Verse 1: Keith Murray ]
Yo, its the permanent chilla, occasional illa
Microphone gorilla, savage nigga chilla
Props stealer, skill dealer
Stadium thriller without the manilla until this day I still uh
Drink Old English cannot stand Miller
Lyrically I'm iller than a fuckin sex killer
Nigga you got a story to tell, tell it, yell it
I rose wit the funkadelic and we dont believe shit stinks til we smell it
Let you tell it, you be putt loopbing work in but be purbin
Defeatin hip-hop's real purpose
But real hip-hop will surface at your service
Yeah you gots the right to be nervous
And if it ain't them niggas its the motherfucking cops
Plus some sucker duck MCs after my props
Cause I moved it up a few notches but get your hand out my pocket
Before I blast off in your face like a rocket

[Break: Biz Markie ]
It dont,stop keep on
Til the break of dawn
I said Redman, my man, my mellow
Get on the mic cause I know you eat jello

[Verse 2: Redman ]
Well its the Doc in the flesh of course I'm fresh
If you thought that I was starvingâ€”Yo, I'm still starvin
When I take a tab and drink liquor all together
E.T.A. for me to blackout whenever
When I transform a twelve blood cells
And my tape bangs and quakes the Fort Lauderdale
I keep a so low pro tanks be full
Why you fools looking for Doc like Sammy the bull?
I be on two oh , with the Dro, fuck who you know
Where two coats when I be in range like Kukoc (jumpshot)
You know, I walk with a sumo
Attitude, acrobatical, mathematical
Bizarre then dialog my jaw
To react when the spawn to outdraw McGraw
You need a second time around like Chalamarle
To touch Doc forget it
Thats like my uncle getting approved for credit, I do it to death
When I start hooking right you be hanging a left
Check out the only crew that makes the power moves
Whosever next on the mic, wear shower shoes
Five more seconds on the clock
Your whole box been jumped on by the Doc hopscotch

[Outro: Biz Markie ]
