[Intro: Kesha]
Cause I want my ass...
Shit, one more time?

[Verse 1: Kesha]
Well, it's twenty twelve, think we're going to hell
(You must be upgraded)
Put me under your acid spell
(You must be upgraded)
Cause I want my mind to be completely toast
(You must be upgraded)
When the tides destroy the whole West Coast
(You must be upgraded)
Cause I want my ass to be jumping too
(You must be upgraded)
Oh my, my, and a boo hoo-hoo

[Hook] [x4]

[Verse 2: Kesha]
So with the world ablaze, I'm in an acid haze
(You must be upgraded)
And though the end is near, I have no fear
(You must be upgraded)
What you do for me is not the same
(You must be upgraded)
I'm having fun, while you're having pain, ha

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Kesha]
Two thousand twelve
Good morning to the New Year's light
Just save yourself
Oh, I'll meet you on the other side
Is this the ending
The curtain call, the fall of man?
Is this the ending
Or are we gonna start again?
Are we gonna start again? [x7]
Are we gonna start?

(You must be upgraded)
Oh my, my, and a boo hoo-hoo
(You must be upgraded)
Oh my, my, and a boo hoo-hoo
(You must be upgraded)
Oh my, my, and a boo hoo-hoo
(You must be upgraded)

With theâ€”
Oh, sorry
