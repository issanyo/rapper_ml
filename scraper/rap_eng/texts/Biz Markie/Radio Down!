[Chorus:]
Don't turn the radio down
(We want the music loud)
Don't turn the radio down
(We wanna mess around)
We feel like dancin'
We wanna dance, so
Don't turn the radio down
Don't turn the radio down
(We want the music loud)
Don't turn the radio down
(We wanna mess around)
Nah nah nah nah nah Hey!
We on the radio, so
Don't turn the radio down

We wrote some songs, made a record
But we had no place to go
So we go some old computer parts
And built a radio
Now we can dance baby
You wanna dance baby?
Turn up the radio
To start the dance craze!

[Bridge:]
Don't need no talk shows (Nope!)
Don't need no deejay's (No!) can
We can dance in a million different ways
With the record selection and the
Mirror's reflection
And I'm dancin' with myself!
Oh Oh Oh Oh!

[Chorus]

So take a break, take a second
Awww! Shucks!
Quit yer job! When you pump out the
Jammy jams
You take the whole year off
You gotta dance baby
This here's your chance baby
To turn up the radio and
Dance the night away.!!

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Biz Markie]
Pump the bass, pump the highs
I want some ketchup on my hamburger and fries
You know me as B . I . Z . M. A . R . for K, I go to the E
And this is how I slow it down, this is the place to be
Ooh, Ahh, I want a piece of pie
No matter what I say, it always come out fly
That's why I want the brother that's got it like that
They go by the name of The Aquabats!

So let it all come down
Let it all come crashing down
Cuz we ready, to rock it steady
Were gonna dance, dance
Dance to the radio!

[Chorus]
