Girls will break your heart
Girls will tear you apart
They’ll take your love and they'll run
They’ll take your love and they'll run
Girls will break your heart
Girls will tear you apart
They’ll take your love and they'll run
They’ll take your love and they'll run

[Verse One: G, The Wiz]
Dear Sara
This one's for you
I hope all’s going at well Starbucks
I hope your new guy gets hit by a school bus
I hope you get a plus sign on your next test
You gotta drop school just to pay off that debt
I apologize if i’m bit of a hard head
You played me wrong, but you taught me best
You’re a piece of shit and i’m unimpressed
That you left me, lonely sad and sorry
Now I feel so great like my seventh coffee
Since I left you and disappeared
This one last song is for the crowd to hear
I was your Tom and you were my Summer
Now it’s more like 500 days of bummer
When I came to make up you married another
Now doesn’t that shit sound so obscure?
I spoke my heart and you ask what for?
I guess I was lame I guess I was a doofus
But you’re still fucking guys off OkCupid
You said go away I said okay, stupid

[Hook: G, The Wiz]
Girls will break your heart
Girls will tear you apart
They’ll take your love and they'll run
They’ll take your love and they'll run
Girls will break your heart
Girls will tear you apart
They’ll take your love and they'll run
They’ll take your love and they'll run

[Verse Two: G, The Wiz]
Christina
This ones for you
I know you know
We’re both good friends
But let’s not act or play pretend
Just listen to the words that Biz once said

[Biz Markie]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend
Oh baby you

It was you who played me wrong
For a moment in my life you made me strong
You liked Spike Jonze like I like Kaufman
The fact that you knew em just made you awesome
We listened to hit songs on N.P.R
Made Spotify mixtapes and sang along
But weeks turn to months and you never returned my call
Until I saw you with him I should’ve known all along

So girls
This ones for you
That are caught in society impressions
"Guys ask girls" is what’s often directed
I think we need a bit more of Sadie Hawkins
So to Rachel, to Melissa, To Marissa, and to Hazel
You’re some of the names I forgot to mention
I hope your dude knows about your yeast infection

[Hook: G, The Wiz]
Girls will break your heart
Girls will tear you apart
They’ll take your love and they'll run
They’ll take your love and they'll run
Girls will break your heart
Girls will tear you apart
They’ll take your love and they'll run
They’ll take your love and they'll run
