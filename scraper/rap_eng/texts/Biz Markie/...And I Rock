On the week days I be in school
Be in school learnin, the golden rule
I wake up in the morning hangin' out my bed
I don't do a thing till my grace is said
And when it's said, I wipe my ass
And think off all the fly girls in my class
Pay off the don say it can't hurt
I pull on my Lee's and my blue sweat shirt
Walk around the corner seem to catch the bus
And if the bus ain't there I don't dare fuss
Just tell mama I'm Mister bust a day
And she take me to school in a white OJ
But when I get to the school and the bell ring
I don't even worry cause it ain't no thing
Walk in the room they say you're late for class
Teacher mark me late, I'm gonna kick his ass
You know the teachers is gonna listen to me
Cause I'm the diabolical the B-I-Z
And I Rock

"Just here to let you know" "B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I to the E"
"Just here to let you know" "B-I-Z M-A-R-K don't try to front"

[Verse 2: Black Indian]
Yo, now that's classic, I ain't worry about you bastards
I'm at home in my boxers watchin' Tom Warner classics
It's just a rhythym I kick, while I strangle out the beat
While you hear that kick, high drums and snares
Puttin you right here met ya chicken out in Brooklyn
When I hit that rare, air, you don't wanna see Black
When I get mad cause I come and Black axe, square Black maks
It's a real thing while I hold my hands on this microphone
I get it open till the breakadawn, or maybe to the sky kerr caucasian
Y'all be rockin for rhythyms I rock for blacks nations
I leave you all in a daze
I'm pickin' up these flows like pimps that brush waves
Get it for all days my broke cup pawn flows
Cause I'ma keep it on the real, yo

[Verse 3: Biz Markie]
And I Rock
"Just here to let you know" "B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I to the E"

And I Rock
"Just here to let you know" "B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I to the E"

Me and Superman we had a fight
I punched him in the face for all my might
Punched him so hard he fell to the floor
Picked him up, and ragged him some more
Turned around, and who did I see?
It was ah Lois Lane she was lookin' at me
She said: "Yo Biz Markie you are the best
Cause you knocked the S off Superman's chest"
She took my hand and led me to the room
We smoked three joints and cracked the core of the brew
I looked her up I thought she was fine
I knew the deal; what was on her mind
We took off the clothes and clicked off the light
And we rocked the bed, till the sky was white
When it came to the break of day
She said: "Yo Biz Markie why don't you stay?
I've cooked you some breakfast with some orange juice"
That's one thing I couldn't refuse
At around eight I kissed her goodbye
She said: "Whoo! Biz Markie you one hell of a guy!"

And I Rock
"Just here to let you know" "B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I on to the E"
Biz and Premo and you know we do, ROCK
