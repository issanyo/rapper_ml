[Intro]
(Wake up everybody, get up!)
Munch! Munch!
Once upon a time, I was a noisy eater

[Verse 1: Biz Markie]
I'm hungry, I want something to eat
Something with a crunch and very sweet
Just woke up so you know the scenario
I'm craving cereal like Cheerios
Maybe frosted flakes, I might munch
But what popped in my mind is Captain Crunch
So I went to the kitchen to freak my choice
In my stomach I heard a voice
It said: "Please feed me, my tank is on empty
I'm seeing things, so please don't tempt me"
So I said "okay", and got my bowl
Got my milk and cereal, made sure it was cold
Sat down at the table and said my grace
Because I knew what was about to take place
"Yum yum, eat 'em up", my belly said
The crunches so loud errbody jumped out they bed!

[Chorus: Biz Markie]
Here come old flat-top, he come grooving up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeballs, he's one holy roller
He's got...
Crunch!
Did you ever know a noisy eater?
Aauuuuuuuuuuuu!

[Verse 2: Biz Markie]
Now it's lunchtime, and I'm hungry again
I don't know where I should begin
Maybe I'll get some super salmon, mmm that's good
I don't want no chicken, it tastes like wood
But I have to have some chips, ones that crunch
So you can hear me go 'munch, munch, munch'
Some old lady tapped me on the shoulder out of a crowd
And said "Quiet down Biz, you munching too loud!"

[Chorus]
Here come old flat-top, he come grooving up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeballs. he's one holy roller
He's got...
Well excuse me, um, um, well excuse me, um
Well excuse me, um, um, well excuse me
Here come old flat-top, he come grooving up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeballs. He's one holy roller
He's got...

[Bridge: Biz Markie]
Quiet down Biz, you munching too loud!
Yum, yum, yum, yum yum

[Outro]
Mmm, that's good!
They all thought I had stopped
And where's the gravy?
No matter!
