Yeah
Y'all know how this goes down
Doin it funky!
Uh-huh, that's somethin' for the DJ's to cut up
They know (funky!)
Okay, break it down

On your mark, get set, let's go, you know it's me
The incomparable, SK, the B-I-Z
I know it's been a long time since you heard me
Do the beatbox and rock an LP
But right about now in 2003
I gotta make one to rock the party
As I change back from DJ to MC
Now it's time to get funky!
For the ladies, for the fellas
East, West, North, South
My style is really outrageous
And when you hear the song it's really contagious
It's simple enough, be understood by all ages
But it will make you go out like gorillas in cages
I used to sing songs myself but now I can't
I need the party people to help with this chant
I need y'all to sing a lil' somethin'
Like thisssssss
Ei ya ya ya, oi ya ya ya
Ei ya, oi ya, ei ya ya ya

[Chorus]
Ei ya ya ya ei ya (ei ya ya ya ei ya)
Sha na na na, na-na-na-na-na (sha na na na, na-na-na-na-na)
Ei ya ya ya ei ya (ei ya ya ya ei ya)
Sha na na na, na-na-na-na-na (sha na na na, na-na-na-na-na)
Ei ya ya ya, oi ya ya ya
Ei ya, oi ya, ei ya ya ya

I was a rap king
But you know, on the tables I've been doin my thing
Like Lisa Stansfield, I've been around the world
I'm from New York, like Earl the Pearl
But since I live in Washington I'm Redskin like Levon
Hangin' at Dream and V.I.P. like a superstar
But I don't buy the bar, I buy a Red Bull
And sip and look at all the chicks that's, beautiful
Like dark-skinned, light-skinned
White, Puerto Rican, Ital-ian
I like to see them dance and drippin with sweat
Givin' them more than they were supposed to get
Winter, spring, summer or fall
Whether you're eatin' food or drinkin' alcohol
They gonna rock your body all night long
'Cause this beat, it kick your ass like King-Kong
Listen to B, I am the
Original S-K B-I-Z, RRAHHAAAAHAHHHHHHH

[Chorus]
You can do the hokey pokey or even the wop
I don't care what you do baby, just don't stop
A zunga zeng to the break of day
Listen to the brother with the rhythm rhymes I display
Whether you from New York or L.A
You listenin' to the B-I-Z every day
I was always a class clown, never the teacher's pet
That's why right now I'ma do the alphabet
Like A-B-C-D-E-F-G
H-i-j-k-l-m-n-o-p
Q-Rrrah-S, T-U-V
Ah W-X say Y and Z
That's why a lot of emcees wanna see
If I'm gonna fall off but I'm not G
I'm guaranteed to go all night with rhymes I write
I've gotten the mic guaranteed like Entertainment Tonight
So listen as I take a breather
I'm old school New Yorker like my name's Contiva{?}
I'm Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens
Long Island, New Jersey, and I'm on the scene
