[Intro: Biz Markie]
That's right, comin' to ya all day and all night
They are--I don't have to mention them cause they're superstars
We gonna do a little something like this
Aaaahh!

Dear Alex and Marilyn
They're Lovey and Thurston Howellin'
The grasshopper unit is prowlin'
And Rufus is back home growlin'
For all of y'all that be dozin'
On Hornblower's lederhosen
Like Walt Disney he'll be frozen
And then the Swiss Hall of Fame, he goes in
Cause when he's out in space carousin'
Pick up my mic and start joustin'
My name plate medallion
Says never trust a Hal 9000

Well, can't, won't, don't stop rockin' to the rhythm
Cause I get down, cause I get down
Cause I get down, get down, get down, get down, get down

Check the horizontal hold and check the tint
Are these three fools back at it again?
Inspector Clouseau and Derek Flint
Nothin' but sparks ignitin'
Check two, one-two, mic testin'
This one goes out to Dechen
Rise fallen fighters, take your stance again
Don't think too much about the color of skin
Order in vegetarian shark's fin
Try to keep my life nonviolent
Mario, rewind the tape and "Punch 'em in!"
Like Chuck D with the where you never been, I'm in

Well, can't, won't, don't stop rockin' to the rhythm
Cause I get down, cause I get down
Can't, won't, don't stop rockin' to the rhythm
Cause I get down, cause I get down

I'm a long way from where I've been but I gotta keep moving, movin' on

Oh, my-my, I'm really not feelin' it
Oh, my-my, something's really wrong
Oh, my-my, I'm really not feelin' it
Oh, my-my, something's really wrong

The PA sound is deafenin'
Bitin' MCs, I'm oustenin'
With spinach in your teeth, you're grinnin'
So on your way out, please take a mint
Got the studio to throw a craze in
The basslines Yauch just lays in
This song is the grass you're grazin'
Add a little flange and phase in
Don't get mad cause I'm beguilin'
I'm off the hook, so don't bother dialin'
They're gonna put me in the b-i-n
And if I die, notify the next of kin

Can't, won't, don't stop, can't, won't, don't stop
Can't, won't, don't stop, can't, won't, don't stop

Movin' on

Fresh!
