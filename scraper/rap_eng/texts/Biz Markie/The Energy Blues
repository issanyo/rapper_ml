[Intro]
And now, the Energy Blues

[Verse 1]
Energy
Sometimes I think I'm runnin' out of energy
Seems like we use an awful lot for
Heatin' and lightin' and drivin'
Readin' and writin' and jivin'
Energy, you'd think we'd be savin' it up

[Verse 2]
Energy, you can get it by dammin' up a river
Energy, a windmill can make the breeze deliver
But even with millin' and dammin'
Our needs are so much more demanding
Energy, we have to use some kind of fuel

[Verse 3]
Chop, chop, chop, the cavemen used wood to start their fires
Chop, chop, chop, they made all the tools that they required
Chop, chop, chop, inventions got more and more inspired
The fires got higher and higher
And clearings got wider and wider
Energy, they were burnin' 'bout all their wood up

[Verse 4]
Then one day men discovered that coal would do it better
Miners dug, and it looked like it might just last forever
It seemed like the final solution
It started an Industrial Revolution
Energy, we just keep on diggin' it up

[Bridge]
In 1859, way out in western Pennsylvania
A man had built a rig that got some laughs from folks who came there
But then suddenly, a mighty roar came up from the ground
And soon a gusher gushed and soaked all who stood around
Now no-one knew, who that gusher blew
The petroleum years were on us
And that so many cars and trucks would come to cause a crisis
And then!?

[Verse 5]
Energy, we're looking to try and find some new kind of
Energy , exploring to try and make a new find of
Nuclear and thermal and solar
If we miss we'll get colder and colder
Energy, we've gotta stop usin' you up

[Verse 6]
So don't be cross when momma says turn that extra light out
Just turn it off till we find us a fuel that never runs out
If everyone tries a bit harder
Our fuel will go farther and farther
Energy, we're gonna be stretchin' you out
