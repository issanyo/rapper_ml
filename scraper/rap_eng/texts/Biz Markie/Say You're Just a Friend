[Verse 1: Austin Mahone]
Hey, hey, baby, you been on my mind
I knew you for a long time
But I've been thinking that maybe you should know
Hey, hey, baby can we compromise?
I really want you to be mine
I got a million places that we could go, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Austin Mahone]
I wanna be your everything
I wanna be the one you need
So tell me, where you been all my life?
Can I make you mine tonight?

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Hey, baby, you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah you say you're just a friend
Hey, baby, you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah, you say you're just a friend

[Verse 2: Austin Mahone]
Hey, hey, baby, we been on the phone
Spending time together alone
But every time we talk the words don't come out right, yeah
Hey, hey, baby, when I look in your eyes
I can tell you are holding something aside
I'll be thinking 'bout you
Are you thinking 'bout me?

[Pre-Chorus: Austin Mahone]
I wanna be your everything
I wanna be the one you need
So tell me, where you been all my life?
Can I make you mine tonight?

[Chorus: Austin Mahone (Flo Rida)]
Hey, baby, you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah you say you're just a friend
Hey, baby, you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend (Flo Rida)
Yeah, you say you're just a friend

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
And Carol City spent most of my nights
Trying make the world whistle, it's a hell of a life
How to make them get low, bring it back right round
Let the good times roll, feeling good right now
But I remember Biz Markie
1989 or maybe 90
Came to me like the song I wrote
Cuttin' class, chasin' you, 'cause you all I want
Like you, you got what I need
And if not, I'll just pretend
Until I can get your friend, I'm playing though
But maybe that is a little true sprinkle in em'
We be catching eyes and I can see them twinkle in them
Thought we be together till I seen the wrinkle in them
But I guess not

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Hey, baby, you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah, you say you're just a friend
Hey, baby, you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah, you say you're just a friend
Hey, baby, you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah, you say you're just a friend
Hey, baby, you, you got what I need
But you say you're just a friend
Yeah, you say you're just a friend
