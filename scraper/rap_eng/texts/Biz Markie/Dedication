You've been hatin' on my city fo a while

[Verse 1: Coo Coo Cal]
It's Milwaukee Wis-consin, stompin' over the game of rap
Got lil' pimp in us, (?) got game and a strap
It's where the thugs stay and drugs lay
But hungry hoes will pack your shit and turn some tricks
Cuz we won't budge babe, we play the game till the last quarter
If money drop like the spot then you can't leave till the last boulder
We gettin' older, and wise 'n rise wit advengance
Puttin away then 'lacs and comin back slid'n in dem Benz's
We blowin' up like the World Trade
Half of the scratch we pack
Come from rap, and all the rest your girl made
So if we don't see you at the top
Wavin' hangin outta drop dawg
Bumpin one of my songs that got the game on lock
Top of the charts with this hardest rap
It's Coo Coo Cal chap representin Milwaukee where I started at
Whoever thought of that of us bubblin up like champaigne
Ridin' thru your city on dem thangs nigga, fo real

[Chorus]
Ain't been to the city in awhile
Now we had to shout y'all down
And if you don't let us thru the do'
We'll have to go and get the 4-4
