Now here's the thing - it's Friday and I'm out to swing
Talkin to all the fly girls, me and my ding-a-ling (mmhmm)
I check the dollars in my pocket, and park my ride
I scope a club up and down, I guess I'll step inside
Now once I'm inside the club, hey yo the scene's aight
All the fellas is dookied down and the girls was HYPE
Not two minutes inside the door but conversation is still deep
I'm talkin to this girl I met on the ave last week (I speak)
Hey love, how you doin, what's your name?  I'm Shelly D
Forget the small talk, wanna spend the night with me?
We step off to my car, and yo, off with the clothes
Y'all know what comes next (What Shell?) Foggy windows

Chorus: Biz Markie {*singing off-key, like always*}

Oh what a night!
LA-DIES KNOW his name is Shelly D
And ev-erywhere he go he rocks with me
But now he's innnn for a night
.. hit it Shell!

[Diamond Shell]
Now on Sunday, some rest, they sit around and they bored
But some get dressed up and go to the house of the Lord
Now me I'm at the mall and yo y'all know how that is
Crowds of people is out there sweatin me cuz my brother is Biz
People ask me questions like, "Hey Shell, where is the Biz?"
I say - it wasn't my turn to watch him, I don't know where he is
And hey - I'm not his father, and Biz ain't got no keeper
If you want to find the Biz Markie then try usin his beeper
"Suppose he doesn't call us back, where can we reach the B?"
Try 1-900-The-BIZ-MARKIE
From the pack of knuckleheads I step off from the scene
Two stores down the mall I spot tight biker jeans
I step up, I introduce myself, my famous way of strikin
Hello, my name is Shell and yo I really like your bikers
She laughed, she kinda smiled, she said, "What can I say?"
I said how about your name?  She said, "My name is Terae"
She fell quickly under the spell of ladyslayer Diamond Shell-a
I grabbed for her hair she shook just like Jell-o
No force or hesitation we went right to my place
We walked in, she disrobed, I kissed her face
I went to work on that booty like it was a chore
This was not the average Sunday or the average bore
- you know how that go, when you got a girl in the crib
- you know how that is

Chorus

[Diamond Shell]
Now it's Friday it's hot, the last day of summer school
But I can't break a sweat cause like V I'm Cool
Two minutes more, and I'm glad what I'm gonna be
Cause like Social Studies, I'm History (see-ya!)
Now on my way to my crib I plan my weekend oh
Wild nights, wild clubs and plenty of love
I'm thinkin to myself this weekend is gonna be great
What's next on the list?  Hmm, a blind date
Now dressin my best to impress this blind date
Though I never seen her before somebody said she look great
Don't get me wrong now, I don't believe those rumors for jack
But yo, this one is factual cause Biz told me that (yeah right)
I met the girl and guess what?  She looked pretty aight
For the first time in a long time, Biz was right
We talked we planned our night out, and movie and eats
And after the movie, she promised me a special treat
I drove her back to her house and she invited me in
She said, "Shell, brace yourself, the treat's goin to begin"
We went into another room, she sat me on the couch
Unbuttoned my shirt, and then she kissed my mouth
She pushed me down and licked my stomach, my heart started to zing
"What happened next Shell?"  She did that +NASTY+ thing

Chorus: Biz Markie {*still singing off-key*}

Oh what a night!
