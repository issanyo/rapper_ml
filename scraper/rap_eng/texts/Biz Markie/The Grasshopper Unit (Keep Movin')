Dear Alex and Marilyn
The Lovely and Thurston howlin'
The grasshopper unit is prowlin'
And Rufus is back home growlin'

For all of y'all that be dozin'
On Hornblower's lederhosen
Like Walt Disney, he is frozen
And in the Swiss Hall of Fame he goes in

'Cause when he's out in space carousin'
Pick up my mic and start joustin'
My name plate medallion
Says never trust a Hal 9000

Check the horizontal hold and check the tint
Are these three fools back at it again?
Inspector Clouseau and Derek Flint
Nothin but sparks ignitin'

Check two one two mic testin'
This one goes out to Dechen
Rise fallen fighters take your stance again
Don't think too much about the color of skin

Order in vegetarian sharks fin
Try to keep my life non-violent
Mario, rewind the tape and punch me in
Like Chuck D with the where you never been I'm in

I'm a long way from where I've been
But I gotta keep movin', movin' on

Ooh my my I'm really not feeling it
Ooh my my something's really wrong

The p.a. sound is deafenin'
Bitin MCs I'm oustinin'
With spinach in your teeth you're grinnin'
So on your way out please take a mint

Got the studio to throw a craze in
The basslines Yauch just lays in
This song is the grass you're grazin'
Just add a little flange and phase in

Don't get mad 'cause I'm beguilin'
I'm off the hook so don't bother dialin'
They're gonna put me in the b.i.n
And if I die notify the next of kin

It's like that y'all
It's like that y'all
It's like that y'all
It's like that y'all
It's like that y'all
It's like that y'all
It's like that y'all
It's like that y'all

Movin' on
