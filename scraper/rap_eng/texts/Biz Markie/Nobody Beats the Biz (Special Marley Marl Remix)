Yes, y'all-and, to the like beat-and
You could either dance or just have a seat and
Listen to the way-in, what I am displayin
A different kind of rapper language that I am sayin
To all the party people, ? the info
When it come to rockin parties I-am-a-nympho-maniac
Brainiac for doin my dance
And my record Make the Music, will put you in a trance-and
Hypnotize your body-and, like you do Bacardi-and
You won't be fightin or illin, you just be partyin
Down, with the funky sound with yours truly
I'm the original B-I-Z-M-A-R-K-I-be-the-E and
I came to have fun and, not be number one-and
Just hear to let you know, who's like runnin the place
And everywhere that I perform and do a show
(beatboxing sound) as long as you know, that (beatbox drumbeat)

Nobody beats the Biz!
Nobody beats the Bizzzz
(x4)

You know me as the B-I-Z-M-A-R-K-I-E-and
I go for what I know doin a show for human beings
I'm guaranteed to rock I make the ladies scream and shout
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
The Mardi rapper toe-tapper always have it flowin
And when you hear the BizMarkie, I get the job done
Yes I'm the M-A-R the K-I-E you know that's me
I got the stutter step to keep in check my speed is so unique
They say I look and sound funny but I don't be carin
I rock the Latin Quarter, Rooftop, Union Square and
Roseland, the Hassan?, Madison Square Garden
Even rock for the ?work fare at Jaffer Center?
Pardon the way, that I be talkin bout the places I be rockin
I love to perform, for the people that be clockin
Not sayin that you're on mine, you're on it like a hornet
But you pay for the performance, doggone it, you want it
That's why I'm here, to be like lettin you knowin
That I'ma highly recognized as the king of disco-and
Makin people as they have a lot of enjoyment
I'm the best person for this type of employment, that's why...

Nobody beats the Biz!
Nobody beats the Bizzzz
(x3)

On and on, to the break of dawn
When you buy food cheap, you need a coupon
Or catch a sale retail, before it gets stale
So hurry up and get the WIC? check out the mail
And shop non-stop, but how I hip-hop
On the mic and like
Make you co-op-er-ate with the rhythm, that is what I give em
Reagan is the Pres but I voted for Shirley Chilsholm
It might sound confusing, the style that I'm using
But in the end I'm sure that you will find it quite amusing
And funny, oh honey, it's just ridiculous
Don't try to front, come on and admit you was
Thrilled, chilled, your heart was all filled
So respect the architect, as I begin to build
Science and my reliance is upon my rap
Like Carl Lewis I get to it, so let's go the lap...

Nobody beats the Biz
Nobody beats the Bizzzz
(x3)

(TJ Swan)
Nobody beats the Biz, nobody beats the Biz (x2)
My name is TJ Swan, nobody beats the Biz
I rock you on and on, nobody beats the Biz
You know nobody that beats the Biz
I know nobody that beats the Biz
Nobody beats the Biz, nobody beats the Biz (x2)

(BizMarkie does some beatboxing)

(TJ Swan verse resung in this version several times)
(BizMarkie beatboxes again to the end but gets cut short)
