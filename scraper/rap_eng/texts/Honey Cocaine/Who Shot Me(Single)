(Verse 1)
Who shot ya?
Said the motherfuckin' doctor
Shit, I dunno, just touring with my partna
They got the story mixed and shit
With their own versions and different shit
-Uh- The same night I prayed to god
Just the thanking the holy father he made a star and shit
A youngin' still ain't die
But let me thank destiny I'm still alive

(Chorus)
So one time
Cause a youngin' still alive
Two times
Cause a youngin' ain't die
Three times
Cause fate had my side
Thank god, thank god, thank god
One time
Cause a youngin' ain't die
Two times for the angel on my side
Three times
Cause fate had my side
Thank god, thank god, thank god

(Verse 2)
Just another show at the venue
Ordering a meal from the menu
Promoters got their info messed
Tellin' other artist they part of our set
Damn, I ain't tryna disrespect
I'm an artist myself, I'm just tryna be next
Still, We was tryna get shit done
While they getting' pressed and we ain't know nun
T-Raw hit the stage and the crowd was tuned
As I made my way to the dressing room
Rehearsing and practicing till I was sore
Then it was my turn and the outfit go
Heisman 1 and Heisman 2
Surprised all the people, too pussy two
Showin' the fans love and then I said peace
Still it's a reason I ain't do meet and greets

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
We got in the car, we was waiting outside
T-Raw still on, it was almost off time work
He was bout to spit Rack City bitch
Then the homies that was pissed try to throw shit
Fuck, T-Raw wasn't wit it
Just Worldstar the homie, you'll see how he did, damn
-(Video saying) Who threw it!
You threw it?
You threw it?
You ain't throw it nigga
Why you lyin nigga?
You threw it
Ight, see me outside my nigga-
I ain't had a clue bout them guys
But I was being watched cause I felt the vibe
All day, and it grew a times
And T-Raw hadda car, and it looked like mines
Ain't it fucked up
Green light changed red
Ain't it fucked up
This one car next to us
Ain't it fucked up
How the streets got dark
Ain't it fucked up
15 through the car
Ain't it fucked up?
We all got down
Smellin' my own blood, waitin' for a sound
Ain't feelin' shit I was numb
Shocked and paralyzed, one from the gun
Bullets through the tires, stuck at the block
Listening to screamin', then I felt god
Doctors said I was fine
It was just fate cause it wasn't my time
Uh, Doctors said I was fine
It was just fate cause it wasn't my time
God bless

(Chorus)
