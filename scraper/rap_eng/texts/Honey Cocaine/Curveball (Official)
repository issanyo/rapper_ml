[Verse 1: Honey Cocaine]

Tell this bitch "I swerve"
Every thot nigga getting curved
That niggas the worst
Can’t buy my trust with a perf
Got to learn to swim before you surf
Put it on a turf
These motherfuckers got nerve!
You can get murked on the curve
Don’t be actin absurd
I ain’t even saying no words
I just do my thing like, like..
Pussy ass nigga with the stank breath
Spendin all your money on hoes
Ain’t got a thang left
You weak niggas on the same flex
And them boys get swerved
Cause I just can’t stress
In your girl whip trying to spit game
Acting all crazy for some shit fame
You at the club in the same outfit
Came with the same loud bitch
Nigga ain’t about shit

(chorus)
Nigga getting on ya nerve
Kick his ass to the curb
Hit his ass with a curve
Tell that bitch nigga "swerve"
Kick his ass to the 'burbs
Hit him fast with a curve
Curve!
Fuck,fuck trying to talk, that's a curve ball
He don’t stop, throw a curve ball
You can get dropped by a curve ball
Now hit his ass with this curve ball

[Verse 2: Honey Cocaine]

You know the motto
"Honey never fall in love"
Especially not no motherfucking scrubs
You need something, holla at me for the block
But you don’t be trying to holla for no love
Motherfucker I’m not dumb
Motherfucker I’m the bomb
You fucking with me trying to get on
Money never short-- stay long
I don’t love ‘em
Tell me am I fucking wrong?
I throw a curve, curve
He ain’t giving up
Thats the worst, worst
All them bad bitches in his work, work
Curve, curve, curve, curve!
Swerve, switch lanes and I ditch his ass
Like I ain’t wearing my retainers, I shift his ass
Now he tripping I ain’t hitting him back
Tell the fuck boys stop we ain’t getting attached

(Chorus)

Curve x4
You can get dropped with a curve ball
Now hit his ass with this curve ball
Curve x8

(Chorus)
