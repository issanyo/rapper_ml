[Intro: Honey Cocaine]
Regina, you're wearing sweat pants. It's Monday
So?
So that's against the rules and you can't sit with us
Whatever
You can't sit with us!

[Verse 1: Honey Cocaine]
Coca spittin fire but this outfit on some icy shit
Bitches 'bout that life around the world is who I'm likely with
Ain't been off my game bitch
I've been working I don't like to switch
Turn nothin' to somethin'
From the hood and I don't like to bitch
Can a youngin get some space
Imma get 'em murked any day
Niggas hit the corner everyday
We gon' get paid anyway
Hoes gettin' turnt at the show
Pound of the ush for the roll
All the times I hustle on the low
If cops tryna ask we don't know, ho

[Pre-Hook: Honey Cocaine]
Look at me
Bitch look at you
All them niggas lookin' at me
Ain't nobody lookin' at you
(Hahahaha)

[Hook: Honey Cocaine]
You bitches can't sit with me
You bitches can't sit with me
This spot's reserved for me
You bitches can't sit with me
You bitches can't sit with me
You bitches can't sit with me

[Verse 2: Honey Cocaine]
I be gettin' turnt bitch
All the time my homies off the shits
I ain't got no energy for niggas on some softer shit
Once I'm out the crib
It's straight to ridin' in them proper whips
I am out your league
I'm not the one who you should argue with
Y'all doin' somthin' for a milla
Nine or the bitch realer
Pussy bitch I ain't gon' kill ya
But only cause I got a family off killers
Got the white boy Mac Miller
Smokin' on that loud from my dealer
All white straight from the dealer
Now it's off to the islands and the villas, ho

[Pre-Hook: Honey Cocaine]
[Look at me
Bitch look at you
All them niggas lookin' at me
Ain't nobody lookin' at you]
(Hahahaha)

[Hook: Honey Cocaine]
You bitches can't sit with me
You bitches can't sit with me
This spot's reserved for me
You bitches can't sit with me
This spot's reserved for me
You bitches can't sit with me
You bitches can't sit with me
