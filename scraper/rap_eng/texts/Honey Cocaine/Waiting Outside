Verse 1
They can't play games, homie I don't work with them
I always get it done and never get to work with them
Right, you're fucking with me, I'm the wrong one
Strong one, and I go off like I'm on one

Cos it's ??? coming and I ain't fucking
Bitches hating on me but fuck it, I still love 'em
It's true I'm the queen bitch, numbers ain't lying
This spell make a bitch feel like chill without trying

Pre-chorus
If you're looking for me homie I'll be waiting outside
If you're looking for me homie I'll be waiting outside
If you're looking for me homie I'll be waiting outside
Fuck your life, homie, you about to die

Chorus
Real bitches do stuff, fake bitches say shit
Real bitches do stuff, fake bitches say shit
Real bitches do stuff, fake bitches say shit
Real bitches do stuff, fake bitches say shit

Verse 2
I give a bitch something and take her ass home
I'm just a teen but I live like I'm outgrown
I'm from the set bitch, you ain't tryna die yet
Now all the fame things and groupies what I'm tryna get

Fuck, just so my kids ain't hungry
And my kid's, kid's, kid's, kid's, kid's got money
You a bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch and you're fake
A real bitch never cares cuz she always got it made, ah

Pre-chorus
If you're looking for me homie I'll be waiting outside
If you're looking for me homie I'll be waiting outside
If you're looking for me homie I'll be waiting outside
Fuck your life, homie, you about to die

Chorus
Real bitches do stuff, fake bitches say shit
Real bitches do stuff, fake bitches say shit
Real bitches do stuff, fake bitches say shit
Real bitches do stuff, fake bitches say shit

Real bitches do stuff, fake bitches say shit
Real bitches do stuff, fake bitches say shit
Real bitches do stuff, fake bitches say shit
Real
