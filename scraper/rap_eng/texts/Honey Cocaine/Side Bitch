[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (x4)

[Verse 1]
I get money, I'm that type of bitch
An icy whip is what the youngin' likely with
This wifey shit, said he wanna wife me quick
Like I gotta go away, you gonna Skype me shit?
Them hoes ain't down you should know that
Cause a bitch ain't shit if ain't go half
Put 'em on the Instagram as a throwback
I am with the bosses, you just where the hoes at

[Hook]
You a side bitch (yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
It ain't my fault you a side bitch (yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
Why you always trippin', you a side bitch (yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
I'm a boss I ain't never been a side bitch (yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
That's why them niggas love me
I be so fly and I ain't gotta try and that's why them niggas love me (that's why them niggas love me)
Ain't gotta lie ain't cooler than I am
This is why your nigga love me (x4)
I ain't, I ain't no side bitch, I'm the type to rob it (that's why them niggas love me)

[Verse 2]
Uhh, and they love me for sure
They sayin' I'm wonderful and I got something to show
Let me say I mess with no niggas who lovin' these hoes
I ain't got nothin' to do with your man likin' my post, you brok
And your homegirls fake too
If I was in your shoes I'd probably hate too
Wouldn't even be you for a day, boo
I shit on you all day, boo
I'm the entree, boo

[Hook]

And that's why them niggas love me (x2)
