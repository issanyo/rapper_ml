(Intro)
All them niggas crazy
And I don't fuck with crazy niggas
Can't catch me with no crazy nigga
Cause I am not no babysitta
2x

(Verse 1)
I don't want no scrubs
Dirty niggas …
Little boy get the fuck from me
Never gone be no cougar
Hunna racks, no pesos
Every time I'm in Cuba
21 with my mortgage pay
I am not no loser
And all my girls they own shit
All of us on our own shit
I drive myself and get home quick
Cheap like your cologne bitch
Oh ya just called?
Sorry boo my phone tripped
You chicken ass too tender
I don't fuck with no bone …
That … me selling my …
This money bigger than monsters
And I just catch up with you son
Like a new kid in a foster
I'm maintaining, I'm proper
You stay complaining, you softer
Your lazy ass, take a full pass
With no goals, no soccer
He offered, to eat with a … like Kevin Gates
Be my guest for heaven sakes
And now I'm bouta go to like 7 states
I got so much more to do before I'm sent to heaven's gates

(Outro)
All them niggas crazy
And I don't fuck with crazy niggas
Can't catch me with no crazy niggas
Cause I am not no babysitta
2x
