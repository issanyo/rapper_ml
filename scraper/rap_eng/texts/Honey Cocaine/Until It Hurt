[Verse 1]
Got that white gold, black diamonds
Brown tims, snake skin
Socks made of fox fur,that's why your bitch hating
Movment amazing, fast shift fantastic
You basic, average, fuck your dreams, I have it
They can't tell me shit though
Let the gloves and pistols
Back to gold it's simple
Enough, catch go mental
Coming for mine, I complicate it
Fuck your desire, I confiscate it
I'm major bitch, no contemplating
It's Jane doe, no conversation
Who changed bitch? I'm still the same
HC, bitches pinnin' name
Only difference is the paper
I be feeling like who the fuck are neighbors

[Hook:]
I don't trust these bitches at all
I don't trust these bitches at all
I don't trust these bitches at all
Why you judging let they young queen ball
Drink, work, make the damn money till it hurt
Drink, work, make the damn money till it hurt
Till it hurt, till it hurt
Till it hurt, till it hurt

[Verse 2]
I've been touring the world but Toronto's the block
Homie still reppin' Jane and Finch, show 'em the Glock
This is 416, we do not trust the cops
Show my family the way so we can always shit top
We minorities, the bottom of the system
My parents foreigners who came with a mission
No fuckin' english, nothing but a vision
I let it go and let my music do the bitchin'
Nowadays bitches just complaining and shit
Well I be tryna feed all my family, maintaining the shit
I feel like boxin' the bitch, but I'm containing the hits
Cause I don't miss being broke, continue aiming for rich

[Hook:]
I don't trust these bitches at all
I don't trust these bitches at all
I don't trust these bitches at all
Why you judging let they young queen ball
Drink, work, make the damn money till it hurt
Drink, work, make the damn money till it hurt
Till it hurt, till it hurt
Till it hurt, till it hurt
