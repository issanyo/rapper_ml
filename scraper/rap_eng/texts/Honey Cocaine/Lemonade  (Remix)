[Verse 1: Dawn]
Love it when I'm flexin' up in my car
Door swing, open from my passenger
Look up in the mirror, fix my mascara
People wanna know who the hell is her
Drop top ride in my coop deVille
I stay mobbing in my hoopty still
Rattling in the trunk when I play the track
Swerve to the left, yelling holler back

[Hook: Shannon]
Ooh, these haters got a sour look upon their face
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade
Ohh, they lookin' so thirsty
They might just need a drink
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade

[Verse 2: Aubrey]
I feel your eyes on me
I like how it feels
I hope that you enjoy your five
But I'll take it from here
I'm late to the party, but I'm always on time
Misunderstood, but I'm always on your mind

[Chorus: DK]
Who cares if we turn up every night the top down
When we pull up at the light
Don't listen to what nobody say
So loud, I can't hear nobody say nothing
I wish you would say something
While me and my girls is stuntin'
Ain't no problems here
See, I'm just trying to have me a good time

[Hook: Shannon]

[Verse 3: Dawn]
I'm rockin' my sunnie's
To block all this shade
We out here setting up shop
Singin' lemonade
I'm late to the party, but I'm always on time
Misbehaving, always up to no good

[Chorus: DK]

[Hook: Shannon]

[Verse 4: Honey Cocaine]
Yo
Lemonade Lemonade
Haters always hating cause them haters never paid
Fucking run a game, run a game
Always keep it straight real bitches never shame
This hoe trying to lie thats shade
They acting like they die to my name, (lame )
Them boys trying to ride out all the fame
Cause a youngin so high in the game, (lame )
WHY you salty you ain't deckingÂ  out
Your money hurting baby stretch it out
Talk shit you get checked no doubt
You might learn what the flex about
Cause my girls all down for the cost
And they all hold it down for a boss
All gold in my crown in my gloss
See you bitches ain't around that's your lost


[Hook - Shannon]
