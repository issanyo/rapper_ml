[intro: apl.de.ap]
(hol' up)

Me and you against the world, girl
All we gotta do is be

Me and you against the world, girl
All we gotta do is be

We ‘bout to run the world, girl
All we gotta do is be

[verse 1: apl.de.ap]
She got me swingin’ that gorilla shit
Beatin’ my chest
We go hard like a militant
Breakin’ a sweat
She keeps me sharp as a razor blade
Fits like she tailor made
Fresh enough to be my main squeeze
Sweet as lemonade

Hourglass shape
Got me fallin’ like a fade away
Together we just cock back
Aim and blow the hate away
What can I say?
She pulls my heart
Like a hand grenade
We on the move, spread the word
Like its marmalade
She got me revved up, hot
Like a motor bike
Love like a G650
She my prototype
This ain’t your average blasé blah
We hit em’ hard
Baby, tell them what’s up
Sing it J

[hook/Chorus: Jessica Reynoso]
Just let your imagination run free
Its you and me
All we gotta do is just be
The world's in the palm of our hands
We don’t need no plans
You can let your spirit just be
A little time is all you’ll need
So your soul can breathe
All you gotta do is just be
All we gotta do is just —
All we gotta do — (all we gotta do is just be)

[verse 2: Honey Cocaine]
All you gotta do is just be
Why you wonderin' and worryin' 'bout things on you and me, see
Breathe a bed
Baby close your eyes, release
Pass the keys, freeze
Watch me let my hair down in the breeze
Is you down to smoke a pound? (slow it down)
Let's hit the road, to the other side of town
These golden sounds
From a queen, baby
They know me, I control the scene, baby
Don’t pay attention to my ex
He’s a fiend, baby
Ay
I came here alone, so if you riding, better ride
Forget my fame and my throne
Uh
But if you're tryna to play a game, then its on
Bet I can win your heart, for now
Just put your name in my phone
Uh

[hook/Chorus repeats]

[verse 3: apl.de.ap]
What can I say
Her love bites like a gator
She stares right through me
Like her eyes’ made of lasers
None could ever fade us
We the ‘livest and the greatest
My girl is rock solid
While your girl’s made of paper
And you haters at the gate
Just so amazed at how we made it
We up the elevator, no roof
See ya later
We stay up in the status
We the baddest of the baddest
We could be whatever baby, like
[Honey Cocaine] poof, cause its magic

[apl.de.ap] The team is so supreme
[Honey Cocaine] I be the queen, you be the king
[apl.de.ap] Spark me up and light me up and watch me blow like gasoline (ya know whadda mean?)
This isn’t your average blasé blah
We going hard, baby tell 'em whats up
(what’s up?)

[hook/Chorus repeats 2x]

(all we gotta do is be)
(all we gotta do is be)
