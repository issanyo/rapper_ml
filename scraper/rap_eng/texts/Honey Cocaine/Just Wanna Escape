[Intro]

[Verse 1]
All this pain everyday
It’s driving me insane
People come and go but their problems remain
Nothing changes
Just the looks of new faces
Friends disappear
But they easily replaced
So much stress
Building up in my mind
Breaking down on daily basis
I’m always crying
I ain't lying
This shit is driving me crazy
The lies are really starting to phase me
And lately
I’m trying to change and get by
But my heart is always broken
I’m living a lie
No one understands until they step into my shoes
I’m fighting a battle with nothing to lose
I’m slowly dying
Gonna break apart
All the pain building up is gonna shatter my heart
I can’t go on
I’m not gonna make it
I used to think I’m small
But now I just can’t take it
Cause everyday troubles cause long-term struggles
And love?
All it does is make the pain double
I’m tired of pretending
Cause I realized
That right from the start
My life was built on lies

[Hook]
Nobody cares
No one was ever there
Kicked when I’m down
People just stop and stare
I can’t even breathe
I’m talking
I won’t win to love
My hearts always broken
Nobody cares
No one was ever there
Kicked when I’m down
People just stop and stare
The one thing that I learned to live with is hate
But the only thing I want to do is escape

[Verse 2]
It ain't easy
And hard to believe me
I’m almost invisible
Nobody sees me
So I don’t see why I bother holding on
I always think of giving up
There’s no point of stashing on
Every day I ask the same questions
In the end
Cause after a long night this shit starts again
I’m trying to adjust to these drastic changes
Crying for help
Just asking to be saved
And in reality we all stand alone
We’re all just lost without a place called “home”
I’m tired of being muted every time I speak
I’m tired of having nightmares every time I sleep
I just wanna get away to a place
Cause every day and every night I wish of better days
But it don’t matter cause no one gives a shit
So you might as well save your breath
And just quit

[Hook]
Nobody cares
No one was ever there
Kicked when I’m down
People just stop and stare
I can’t even breathe
I’m talking
I won’t win to love
My hearts always broken
Nobody cares
No one was ever there
Kicked when I’m down
People just stop and stare
The one thing that I learned to live with is hate
But all I really want to do is
Escape
