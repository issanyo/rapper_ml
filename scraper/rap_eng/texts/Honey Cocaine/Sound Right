[Verse 1:]
Got too much pride
No choice but [?] and arise
So grind like 365
This rap shit is why I’m alive
Put the lies and the games to the side
Gotta fight at the end to survive
It’s a goddamn shame we all die
Stay flossing and ain’t even try
I got one shot and one only
I can’t wait for none of you rookies
Won’t even fucking deny it
Bitch I ate all of the cookies
I ain’t falling like Snookie
You’re my stake come and try buck me
Girls hating on me them pussy
Now you ain’t balling you should be
You can learn something if you shut the fuck up
Kept me moving nothing you get cut the fuck up
Don’t step inside so I know all this stuck the fuck up
Put your trust in bitches you get set the fuck up
And I ain’t ever going sideways
All this money mine it ain’t no five ways
I just hit the islands for like five days
I was with the hustle gotta find ways
So I say

[Chorus:]
If you flex yea sound right
Wrecking in them checks yea sound right
Get it faded up best yea [?] right
Telling me I’m next so we down right
You sound right
Kill like 40 shots you sound right
Scream the fuck that cuts you sound right
Bitch I done took the loss and found like
The name I sell for [?] you sound right
You sound right

[Verse 2:]
Let a word that sound right
Right things just sound tight
I count once and I count twice
Make sure the thing shit down right
At a town like
Some friends died and we found like
Tell me what it sound like
Whenever they sound right
Game is a down white
Cause these hoes sticking like a round dice
Honey may sound nice
Check score my fucker hold down the hype
Just pass me the keys
Take a long drive while we blasting them beats
Cause that same week
No lie you’ll get your fancy [?]
If you rule these streets
No fancier fool you believe
Ain’t you low on the heat
Hard entertainment is bold [?] sleep
Please
I ain’t got no time
Gotta get my cheese I gotta get mine
They try this weed and trynna do time
Imma  get my piece and Imma do time
[?]
[?]
[?]
Some people got no dreams
Me I always knew mine
No matter what I’m gonna grind
I’m gonna cut through running over those [?]

[Chorus]
