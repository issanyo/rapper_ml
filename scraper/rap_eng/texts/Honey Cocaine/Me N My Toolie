[Verse 1]
I'm about making money nigga fuck friends
I ain't messing with these suckers I'm like fuck them
I never talk, never speak, never trust them
Me and my toolie walk together, finna done them
Ok, I run them, my toolie always down
I'm from toronto where the hearts and the money brown
You fucking up if you sellin' in my side of town
My city with me and we finna get it by the pound
I've got gold by the gal when I'm sellin' shit
These foolies hatin' but my attitude is celibate
I misbehave it, I'm like fuck it bitch I'm getting rich
If you broke just get a bag and get yourself a brick

[Hook:]
Click, clack bang, I'm doing my thang
It's just me and my toolie making your bitch sang
Click, clack bang, I'm doing my thang
It's just me and my toolie making your bitch sang
It's just me and my toolie, it's just me and my toolie
It's just me and my toolie, it's just me and my toolie
It's just me and my toolie, it's just me and my toolie
It's just me and my toolie, it's just me and my toolie

If you ain't moving right, you gon' get left
I ain't toleratin' hoes, they gon' get checked
A toolie make sure that youngin never get stressed
I'm a queen bitch I know I finna get next
They ain't capable of doing what the queen do
These sluts livin' fake lives while I've been true
What you gon' lie till you die is what the thing do?
All my family is g's, is the real crew
I've been a thug since birth, I done been through worse
So if I ain't the best, nigga fuck your turf
Got the toolie in my pants, toolie in my shirt
Now if you with the shit someone gon' get hurt

[Hook:]
Click, clack bang, I'm doing my thang
It's just me and my toolie making your bitch sang
Click, clack bang, I'm doing my thang
It's just me and my toolie making your bitch sang
It's just me and my toolie, it's just me and my toolie
It's just me and my toolie, it's just me and my toolie
It's just me and my toolie, it's just me and my toolie
It's just me and my toolie, it's just me and my toolie
