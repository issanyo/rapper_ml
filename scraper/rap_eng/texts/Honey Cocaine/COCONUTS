[Intro]
Yaaas!

[Hook]
Since I got a buzz I keep my circle to a minimum
Now my time is limited, every night a cinema
I can't ever sleep at all but I don't give a fuck enough
Forgot about my enemies, they ain't on my mind
That shit's expired
I'd rather let my seat recline, yeah
Sip on this wine, oh
And watch my stars align, yeah

[Verse 1]
Been through too much
To let a hatin' ass bitch be visible (fuck that)
Ain't tryna do too much
Make songs, pay bills, and not be miserable
Can't nobody say I'm the type to complain
'Cause strugglin' is beautiful
When I'm on stage (what)
I just thank God I ain't sittin' in a cubicle
'Cause I could be doing that
Matter fact I was on the way (on the fuckin' way)
We all tryin', how true is that?
I just never waste a damn day (never do that)
Get to hustlin' right away
Put on a beat, I just write away
They love me now, don't sound safe
I swear, fake motherfuckers all around me, man

[Hook]
Since I got a buzz I keep my circle to a minimum
Now my time is limited, every night a cinema
I can't ever sleep at all but I don't give a fuck enough
Forgot about my enemies, they ain't on my mind
That shit's expired
I'd rather let my seat recline, yeah
Sip on this wine, oh
And watch my stars align, yeah

[Verse 2]
A room full of pretenders, forever only one genuine
I can smell the agenda; I mean, the timing is evident
Ain’t no fucking beginner.. Yet I am far from a pessimist
I affiliate winners who let they purpose be resonant
I ain’t following no trends to be relevant
I made money, not friends; that’s the regimen; So when it come to interacting, I’m negligent
Ooo, true, New Testament!
Divine as fuck; getting rich All the shit
I be in, too deep for designer stuff
I’m climbing up; I slaved too hard for this shit
If the devil come around, I ain’t signing up
No way!!!
I don’t even do cocaine!!
Everybody nose; no names!
Flush, new shit; roles change
All of my team here
I stay professional, ask if I’m credible
I don’t participate, yea, that’s intentional
Cannot commit if it don’t involve decimals
I understand you don’t understand that

[Hook]
Since I got a buzz I keep my circle to a minimum
