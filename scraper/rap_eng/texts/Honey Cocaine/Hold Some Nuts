[Verse 1]
New chain cold as fuck, told you before I'm gold as fuck
Love how my fans always showing love
Haters fall back, you could hold some nuts
Or suck off a dick with aids
Heard they wanna hurt me but the kid ain't fazed
Fuck a bully bitch ,I spit in your face
Loyal to the hood, is how the kid was raised
So sit down my ninja or get clowned my ninja
Don't make a sound my ninja,got some rounds my ninja
Got a real fucking stupid flow
You hoes need help in the studio
Word? I was made for this shit, that's why I get paid for this shit

[Pre Hook:]
See you haters chillin' in the crowd
Watching all my money like how
All my fans yelling so loud

All my fans yelling so loud

Thirsty ass hoes, tryna' to be my friends

Screaming thug life till I end
And if I die right now, let me die right now
With a million in my pocket
