Yo
Coca
Uh

[Verse 1 ]
Young Coca, the realest kid
All I see is fake shit, I ain't feelin' it
They all talkin', I ain't hearin' it
I be wishin' a bitch would
I ain't fearin' shit
These hoes weak and it makes me sick
Not fuckin' with you hoes is what made me rich
Bitch, look I hate to quit
So I hustle like a beast cause I'm made for this
Gettin' money that's my favorite
It's all cocaine white and I paid for it
But it ain't easy,  I'mma savor it
I went to work, while you muthafuckas prayed for it
Check it, Ok
I came to eat all the cake
I'm hungry in this place
And bitches lookin' like bait
I get it in because I'm born to grind
Hit up every fuckin' country
I been tourin' from time ho
Anybody hatin' you can suck dick
I don't fuck with niggas I don't fuck with
Money the only thing I'm in love with
I'm just gettin' bigger and I love it
Askin' for favors but can't afford me
Tell the people the truth
Don't change the story
And after all the drama I'm still not tired
But I ain't playin' no games bitch
Shots fired

[hook]
I don't fuck with niggas I don't fuck with
(young coca, young coca)
Shots fired
Anybody hatin' you can suck dick
Shots fired
I don't fuck with niggas I don't fuck with
(young coca, young coca)
Shots fired
Anybody hatin' you can suck dick
Shots fired

[skit]
Sharkeisha no
Don't, don't kick her sharkeisha
Don't kick her

[Verse 2]
This for the hoes before
I used to ride with
The same bitches the youngin used to get high with
To all the hoes in the rap game or wack game
The same bitches with small minds and wack fame
Selling you pussy, you set a low bar
Shamin' us females who fuckin' go hard
My generation got no stars
I only see me and Chain link so far
If you mad bitch step it up
You ain't a bad bitch, sad bitch
You set that up
Them haters hatin' but my head is up
Just watch what I do cause I said enough
I be flowin', spittin', they fuckin' know
Cause these hoes is trippin'
And I'm fuckin' cold
I ain't the greatest but I'll fuckin' grow
Don't doubt me, without me there's no fuckin' show
To all the new people tryin' to fly in
To get a seat with us, it ain't no buy-ins
You tryin' to eat with us, you must be wildin'
Watch how you treatin' us we get to firin'
I got bitches on standby who ridin'
It's guaranteed my bitches will get violent
And after all the drama I'm still not tired
But I ain't playin' no games bitch
Shots fired
