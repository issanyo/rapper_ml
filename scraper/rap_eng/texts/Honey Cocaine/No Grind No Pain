[Verse 1]
2013, it's my year now
All of my supporters is what I hear now
God and only God is what I fear now
Money getting long, who's real now?
When you do it big all these people gon' switch
Low motherfuckers don't appreciate shit
Niggas tryina holler like I let them hit
Fuck chasing love, give a fuck bout no dick
Don't holla at me like we friends and shit
If you ain't with the hustle, don't pretend you rich
Black card shoppin, you spending some chips
Watch me wear something, it'd be trending bitch

[Hook:]
Heard you wasn't feeling my success
Bitch you must've forgot, coca blessed
Should have hit my stomach or chest
But the shit only hit my flesh
So I'm a hold it down like it's the last time
No grind, no shine, no pain, no gain
Hold it down like it's the last time
No grind, no shine, no pain, no gain, nigga

[Verse 2]
So fucking G I'm nice
You hoes not original, you love to bite
Yeah I love money but I don't love the life
Fuck all the fame, I just love me the mike
So I throw it up, I throw it up
Been through it growing up, bitch growing up
Now that I'm old enough, I'm old enough
I show off when I'm showing up
Bitch throw it up
Been spittin' but you suckers all sleep on me
Married to the grind she won't cheat on me
Rap star but still got a key on me
Couple g's on me, try to beep on me, hoe

[Hook:]
Heard you wasn't feeling my success
Bitch you must've forgot, coca blessed
Should have hit my stomach or chest
But the shit only hit my flesh
So I'm a hold it down like it's the last time
No grind, no shine, no pain, no gain
Hold it down like it's the last time
No grind, no shine, no pain, no gain, nigga
