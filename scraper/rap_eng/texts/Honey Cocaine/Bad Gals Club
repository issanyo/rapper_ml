[Intro]
This is for the bad girls in the streets
This is for the bad girls in the streets

[Verse 1: Honey Cocaine]
All my bad girls thugging
Them bitches don't fuck with us, can't tell us nothing
The west stand to the east
We do it for the bad girls who do it for the streets
It's that T-dot show, what you ain't know
They killing my flow, my skin appealing and go
Then I be killing them shows, I know, you telling niggas tryna steal all my dough
So I just get on the low, I close a deal and I go, for sure
Life of a queen, nigga no in-between's
If he's a true bad man then he know what I mean
Pay me in green and make sure them 100s clean
Only bad girls on my team

[Chorus] x4
This is for the bad girls in the streets
He said he love how them bad girls do it

[Verse 2: Mila J & Honey Cocaine]
Hey boy you got it going on
And I know you feel me coming on
So boy let me give it to you, I'mma give it to you
Lay it back, let this bad girl do it to you
Boy let me give it to you, I'mma give it to you
I need a bad boy to let me do, do it
He want that bad girl loving
He just took a hit of this honey, now he buzzing
Drinking Henny like it's nothing
And I be getting back to the money after we fucking, no loving
Another day on the Jane tryna maintain
He want my name, I just want all his chains
I never change, been a bad girl even with fame
We ain't the same, them hoes will never win in my lane
Niggas know that we ride
Hang with a group of the gyal dem nigga, we 5
Whatever we need, we sell that nigga, we grind
All my bad girls throw that peace sign
From the west end to east side

[Chorus] x4

[Bridge: Dawn Richard]
You know you want my loving
Cause I hold you down when you need it
By your side to get this money
It's nothing to get it
Bad girls you know you want it
From Cali to New Orleans
We ride or die
We hustle, chase paper

[Chorus] x4

Said if you want a bad girl I'm the one you call
'Cause I need a bad boy to break me off
He said he love how them bad girls do it
(He said he love how them bad girls do it)
