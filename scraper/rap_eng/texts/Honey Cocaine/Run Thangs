[Hook]
Spend some time, spend some time with you baby
I'll promise I won't behave
No I can't stay, boy so don't play
I don't play, I don't play
No time for the games
Baby I run thangs
I don't play, I don't play

[Verse 2]
I ain't got time for that
If it ain't about the money I ain't tryina chat
He call me honey cocaine but he hope like crack
Told them bitch chill out, he don't know how to act
Fin to take a flight, take a flight
Two cities and the end night
All the time turnt up on the Tuesday
Sipping wine while my ex still dreaming
I'm living mine get right to the cheese
Like my name mac
You ain't even getting jeez, why you came back?
Shitting on your rolex like a train track
Motherfucker I don't even want my chain back
But that's just the karma
Nah I ain't with the drama
But what you tell your mama
I used to facetime with you
Xbox, Netflix, waste time with you
Cause I

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Okay, off that, on to the next one
A new dude, prolly leave with the checks done
But right now he will prolly be the best one
I do him goody come back like he last some
We both some, I get it so we gotta get it
And no fun, honey tatted on his fitted
Tell me he will ride or die and he so committed
But I know he telling lies I'm just going with it
Like that, it's just like that
It's just how the game goes I don't fight back
And we don't never fight, we just have a night cap
But if we ever go to war it's like Chiraq
Only looking at you, no game is true
How the hell did you get through to me?
You don't know what you do to me

[Hook]

[Bridge]
We ain't gotta worry bout that
Call me honey cocaine
I get my girls and I'm back
Call me honey cocaine
I ain't worrying bout you
I got my own
I ain't worrying bout you, no

[Hook]

[Outro]
Only looking at you
Only looking at you
Looking at you
