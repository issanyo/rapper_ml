[Verse 1 - Honey Cocaine]
Bitch I'm young honey from the west end
Ever since I made it all these bitches tryna be my best friend
The fake shit I ain't with it homie
I done learned my lessons
And I been through hardships
To be breathing is a blessin', so
So what the question, so
I heard you doubted
Y'all niggas broke
And we know broke niggas the loudest
The struggle's heavy but who would I be without it
Went from a couple fans and now the show's all crowded
I told you hoes I'm bout it, uh

[Hook - Torey Lanez]
I saw money I'm a rich nigga
All my young niggas up in here with me
Only gettin' paper never minus
Only eatin' at a table that with my niggas
Ayy

[Bridge - Torey Lanez]
Don't act like you never expected it
Nigga I made it
I ride through the 6 in the 7 my bitches is famous
I tell all  those hoes that I did it I swear that I did it
Shit I'm the only one with it
Ayy

[Verse 2 - Honey Cocaine]
I been grindin' on the low low
No trustin' bitches, I been makin' moves on solo
Next to my haters I am grateful for the promo
Thought I was garbage now you askin' for a photo, wow
Cause I'm global, I
Ain't takin' no losses
Ain't got no time already
I ain't takin' no off
You wouldn't last if you hustle cuz you hoes suck
I'm from the 6 side where the youth dem go off
Fuck niggas we over
