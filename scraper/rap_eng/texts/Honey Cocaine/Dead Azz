[Hook]
Niggas think I'm playin' round here
Bitch you know the sayin' round here
(Honey get money)
Niggas think I'm playin' round here
Bitch you know the sayin' round here
(Honey get money)
Nigga I ain't playin' I'm dead ass
Bitch I ain't playin' I'm dead ass
Bitch I ain't playin' I'm dead ass
Dead ass, d-dead ass

[Verse 1]
Hold your bitches I'm too fly
With some golden bitches we too high
Though we hold them riches we do ride
No lie don't choose sides we bitches with blue eyes
Broke her whole nose in the eighth grade
All my homies still say I'm still the same way
True players understand that my game's straight
Only give a fuck about keys and tryna gain fame
Ay bitch I go hard for the T dot
Why these hoes lookin' at me like they see Pac
Can't be trustin' no niggas I gotta keep watch
Don't be fussin' no nigga [?]
I don't like those funny niggas foolish
And pussy niggas talkin' when how many niggas do this
Let me [?]
I be with a bredder
Hold on gotta get gas
Don't pop me cause I'm dead ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Raised on the block so I stayed down
But I never move hot never make sounds
Gotta watch for the cops and the snakes round
Ain't no time to be waitin' 'till my [?]
If time is cash then homie I'm doin' life
You bitches rappin' homie then do it right
I heard he askin' on me I do it nice
He love the fashion on me and all the lights
Fuck that nigga get my shit and the dip
I'm a [?] ass bitch I didn't get it to switch
Do a hundred on snip with the chip in the whip
Anything you heard about me bet the shit is a myth, rich
Young bitch with a goal
Imma let you hoes know you just a thot with a hole
We ain't friends now gon' get back
Or get sprayed without wet pack
Don't test Coca I'm dead ass

[Hook]
