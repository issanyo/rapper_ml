[Hook]
Tick, ticking down your love like a one time
No handcuffs, boy I'm ready for it
Go and get yours I'ma get mine
Don't forget me baby, please don't forget me baby
Once I get a mill I'ma settle down
Once I get a deal I'ma settle down

[Verse 1]
Are you saying I never settle?
Daddy used to say I was a rebel
First place I ain't even got a medal
I'm a diamond, I ain't looking for a pebble
Fast lane hit the pedal yo
Now we got me on a pedestal
You just waiting boy you better go
Now I ain't fucking other niggas though
For real doe
So please don't feel no type away
Cause I cannot say without no price to pay
On top of my shit like the icing on cake
I'm chasing the vandals like no license plate
Ask me if I missed you maybe sometimes
Tryina snatch me up but you ain't ready for it
I'm finna be winning on the frontline
Running for your love like I got a warrant

[Hook]
Tick, ticking down your love like a one time
No handcuffs, boy I'm ready for it
Go and get yours I'ma get mine
Don't forget me baby, please don't forget me baby
Once I get a mill I'ma settle down
Once I get a deal I'ma settle down

[Verse 2]
Look out how I've been running all day
I'm burning that creme like brulee
Babe you left your gun at my place
Come over I come on your face
I twist up a blow we can blow
You hungry let's jump in the golf
We pull up to Timmy's get eggs and some bacon
The niggas who fakin get turned into toads
He wanna fucks with the queen
Cause I got them knots in my dreams
So now he ain't worried bout me
He fall back and watch me on screen
Big bucks sweet blocks yeah I'm headed for
No I won't forget you baby, I'ma see won't give up
When we ready for it
Know that I'ma be your baby

[Hook]
Tick, ticking down your love like a one time
No handcuffs, boy I'm ready for it
Go and get yours I'ma get mine
Don't forget me baby, please don't forget me baby
Once I get a mill I'ma settle down
Once I get a deal I'ma settle down
