Why you acting like a bitch be?
Telling me you miss me
Ain't my boyfriend your friend, boy?
Nig-nigga you shifty
No, you can't honeydick me
No, you can't honeydick me, yeah yeah
No, you can't honeydick me
No, you can't honeydick me, ohh

[Verse 1]
You look like a motherfucking uhhh
Posed to be his mothafuckin' bruh
I should slap you with the strap, no bra
Leave you eating through a motherfucking straw
Slidin' in my DM's like a fuckin' skateboard
With your itty bitty thang in your drawers
Breaking codes, nigga, you should break laws
That'll happen when you being fake cause
Fuck them, that's why I never ever trust them
A buster, your pop shoulda used a rubber
I told him watch out for the snakes, see a mamba
Mama's worried bout me, fuck drama
Up in a shilly, yup, fucking up some commas
Life is a beach and these niggas is piranhas
You don't get pussy, virgin like Madonna
Thirsty nigga, swear you was born in Uganda

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Finally, this nigga gave up
Honey Cocaine made him hate drugs
Stomp fast, walked on him like a rug
Heart broke, listenin' to Drake's stuff
Tryna get my home girl but she don't like you
Snapshot and put you on the Gram is what she might do
Cold hearted, veins spilling like ice cubes
My team goons, motherfucker, we don't like rules
Moral of the story: don't try me
Real hoes and bros, the only thing around me
This nigga a shark, he prolly wanna drown me
Messy mothafucka washed up with no Downy
I really I ain't even tryna go in
But what would you do if he tried you and your friend?
His friend is my man so that mean he triflin'
To my boyfriend and, click clack, nigga lightning
