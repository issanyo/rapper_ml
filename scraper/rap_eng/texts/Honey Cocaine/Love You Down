It never fucking mattered too much to me
That you was just always not enough for me
This why I be acting like you ain't shit
But all my friends know it's just how I get, I get, I get
Why you, why you, why you playin I'm workin and I'm prayin
That you get what I'm sayin and this is what I'm sayin
I'm meant for you, you're meant for me
It's ment for us we're meant to be
God sent you me, you treating me like I'm your fucking enemy
She ain't truth, she a lyin as bitch
Yeah she still the bitch you been spending time with
How you do me like, do me like I try to show you
I always do it for you and never fucking told you

I ain't gone take off now
Till the death I'll give you my life
I ain't gone take off now
Till the death I'll give you my life

It never fucking matter too much to me
That you was just always not enough for me
This why I be acting like you ain't shit
But all my friends know it's just how I get, I get, I get
Now you, now you, now you hurtin
Oh you know how I feel now
I know I be quiet but my broken heart is still loud
Shit is still loud, shit is still loud
I know I be quiet but my broken heart is still loud
I wish I never met you I always try to forget you
The time I used to text and sext you just so special
But you got love for another bitch
And I'll be tryin to deal with some other shit

I ain't gone take off now
Till the death I'll give you my life
I ain't gone take all night
Till the death take off now

I fucking hate love
