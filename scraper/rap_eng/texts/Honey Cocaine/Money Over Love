Pre-Chorus:

Money over love, money over love
Swear I love my money
Money over love, money over love
Swear I love my money

Chorus:

I think about you all day
I always think of you
But there ain't room for two
'Cause now my money's calling
Tell me what I should do, I choose money over you
But I like it like that

[Verse 1: Honey Cocaine]

What would you say
If I told you I could teach you the way
To get rich without being a slave
A 9-5 will have you going insane, going insane
See I do what I do
Shit, I used to work at Burger King too
Where I had to keep that burner ting true
Like Mike Brown know that could've been you, its on one you knew
Fuck the boys in the blue
We the reason why there's noise in your crew
I ain't Floyd in the barbershop fool
In the 6 they all know me boo boo, they know me boo boo
I'm the female MJ
I don't see nobody else in my lane
I don't even need help what a shame
But thinkin' bout you got me going insane, going insane


Chorus:

I think about you all day
I always think of you
But there ain't room for two
'Cause now my money's calling
Tell me what I should do, I choose money over you
But I like it like that

[Verse 2: Honey Cocaine]

I been getting money what you mean
All you rappers sleep off the lean
I don't even sleep, I just dream
I like my money like my tea all green
Ain't no motherfucker paying for me
Anything you see me in ain't cheap
I ran into him &; his bitch ain't speak
He work to live, I live to work it ain't free
Everybody gotta get it on they own
I'm on the road but I get it on my phone
And while school, I was bringing work home
And some of us gotta get it on the pole
In this world they judge
And make promises and don't give a fuck
You see I do it for the two of us
And only money gone stay true to us, it ain't new to us

Chorus:

I think about you all day
I always think of you
But there ain't room for two
'Cause now my money's calling
Tell me what I should do, I choose money over you
But I like it like that

Pre-Chorus:

Money over love, money over love
Swear I love my money
Money over love, money over love
Swear I love my money

Money over love, money over love
But I like it like that
Money over love, money over love

But I like it like that (4x )
