[Verse 1]
I just wanna hold that rum
He just tryna be that one
Niggas luh to lie on they dick
I already know that tongue
Yeah, yeah
Young but I never been dumb
Broke and I'm never goin' back
I just had to grow up fast
Facts!
Sick days, I ain't takin' no time off
Light one just to take my mind off
Young Honey gettin' money, so what now?
Gotta watch who the fuck I'ma trust now
Ya, follow no trends, like nah
No new friends
Give a fuck who you is
Couldn't even pay rent now I own a few cribs

[Pre-Hook]
I still ride around my city
Hit my phone like what's the vibe
I get money, you get petty
You just postin' for the hype
I just haha on the low
Only way it gets me high
All my bitches, yea, they know
Fo sho

[Hook]
Pour that shit one time for me
Light that shit one time for me
He be like "why you never got no time for me?"
Only one thing on my mind, honey

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
I'm done with the fake shit (fuck it)
My time never wasted (hell nah)
Ain't takin' vacations
I'm chasin' the bacon (gotta go)
He said he wanna get money, get fly with me
But uh, only my Rolly share time with me
Maybe just one night, that's fine with me
Then I'm out, got the bag in the sky with me
When I'm Cali, I'm like "what's the vibe"
When I'm Texas, I might slow it down
When I'm in Jersey, I'm makin' them sounds
Back in the 6, we be movin' them pounds (gotta move it, yeah)
They gon' fuck with me everywhere I go
I can tell a real one with my eyes closed
I just bought a new whip on my iPhone
So we can take a drive if you want to

[Pre-Hook]
I still ride around my city
Hit my phone like what's the vibe
I get money, you get petty
You just postin' for the hype
I just haha on the low
Only way it gets me high
All my bitches, yea, they know
Fo sho

[Hook]
Pour that shit one time for me
Light that shit one time for me
He be like "why you never got no time for me?"
Only one thing on my mind, honey
