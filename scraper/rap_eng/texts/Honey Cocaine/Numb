[Intro]
Yeah, Honey

[Chorus]
I wanna feel something
Not just anything, I mean a real something
When he say he love me, I don’t feel nothing
Everybody numb, might need to feel something
Yeah, I wanna feel something
Not just anything, I mean a real something
When he say he love me, I don’t feel nothing
Everybody numb, might need to feel something

[Verse 1]
Young bitch, from the shit, on the Boulevard
Held ‘em to my ear, I just cut ‘em off
Night shit, hype shit, pay ‘em no regard
Night shit, my strips, see it in the dark
All of the shit, I went through behind me
I don’t fuck with no fraud, you won’t find me
If I don’t hit you back, then don’t mind me
All this shit just gotta go, give me psychological

[Chorus]
I wanna feel something
Not just anything, I mean a real something
When he say he love me, I don’t feel nothing
Everybody numb, might need to feel something
Yeah, I wanna feel something
Not just anything, I mean a real something
When he say he love me, I don’t feel nothing
Everybody numb, might need to feel something

[Verse 2]
I done came up, and got the same money now, now
That’s on my soul, ain’t nothing changed on me, nah, nah
I got the real, that’s why I stay Honey
They don’t feel my pain on me
I don’t feel a thing on me
Yeah, got it out the block, I’m like O’Neal
Now I got no service in the hills
Don’t wanna catch up, I don’t wanna chill
I just want someone I can feel, yeah

[Chorus]
I wanna feel something
Not just anything, I mean a real something
When he say he love me, I don’t feel nothing
Everybody numb, might need to feel something
Yeah, I wanna feel something
Not just anything, I mean a real something
When he say he love me, I don’t feel nothing
Everybody numb, might need to feel something

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Young Honey, woah
If you about your business, we can build something
