[Intro]
Honey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I fuck it up one time, fuck it up one time
But if I like it, I but it in two’s like
Bitches on my time, that’s if I have time
I don’t feel no ways, not even sometimes
Addressing, no second guessing
Here with my bitches, it’s a blessing
We are real [?], of who we ride with
Bitch don’t question, money on my mind
These fake, fake, fake, I see the signs
And they won’t take mine, oh, no, no, no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I be on that wave, you cannot touch
Fuck him, I just send him right back home
I ain’t with this shit it’s just too much
Damn Honey getting money

[Chorus]
Be like, yeah, yeah, we don’t say a whole lotta shit now (whole lotta shit, don’t say a whole lotta shit now)
We go, rah, rah, we don’t say a whole lotta shit now (whole lotta shit, don’t say a whole lotta shit now)

[Verse 2]
I be with some fly hoes, burn around them side hoes
Hating on me, why though? And fuck what I know
I just hit the drive through, and light the fire too
But for the tale, homies, we ain’t scared to die too
I hear they hungry for money, they know that Honey get paid
They see me wilding designer, but they don’t know ‘bout them days, nah
Yeah, he just wanna hype me now, bitch don’t bring that drama ‘round

[Pre-Chorus]
I be on that wave, you cannot touch
Fuck him, I just send him right back home
I ain’t with this shit it’s just too much
Damn Honey getting money

[Chorus]
Be like, yeah, yeah, we don’t say a whole lotta shit now (whole lotta shit, don’t say a whole lotta shit now)
We go, rah, rah, we don’t say a whole lotta shit now (whole lotta shit, don’t say a whole lotta shit now)

[Outro]
I be on that wave, you cannot touch
I ain’t with this shit it’s just too much
Damn Honey getting money, be like
