[Hook]
At first I thought you was all mine
But no, you lied
Come to find you had another girl
Right there, on the side
But damn these man's ain't shit
Don't waste my time, no
But damn these man's ain't shit
That boy ain't mine, no
But damn these man's ain't

[Verse 1]
See I thought you was so different
And I thought we could've made it long distance
Soon as a romance turn to bitching
Caught your ass slipping
Then you went missing
Look I done been played before
And I had to tell myself I would take it slow
Now you out all late with hoes
But I swear we was good just days ago
How you gonna tell me you down now
Feeling ways cause a bitch done found out
Better check all your friends with a loud mouth
Thought you were the one but you looking like a clown now

[Hook]
At first I thought you was all mine
But no, you lied
Come to find you had another girl
Right there, on the side
But damn these man's ain't shit
Don't waste my time, no
But damn these man's ain't shit
That boy ain't mine, no
But damn these man's ain't

[Verse 2]
Boy, boy you ain't shit and your man's ain't
But I can do it for myself if a man can't
Should have known my only love was Ben Frank
Well let me tell you what I heard when my friend came
Said she having boy problems too
Funny how he had the same ring as you
And even know I let her man and it's screwed
And she showed me a motherfucking picture of you!
So don't throw fits when I call you a bitch
What's type of man got a heart as small as his dick
No second chance to restart I'm calling it quits
And I hope you ain't the type your daughter will get
Cause best believe my father will trip
And you won't even want my brothers getting on the mix
Next time, next time I ain't falling so quick
But if I call, I'm just calling the hit

[Hook]
At first I thought you was all mine
But no, you lied
Come to find you had another girl
Right there, on the side
But damn these man's ain't shit
Don't waste my time, no
But damn these man's ain't shit
That boy ain't mine, no
But damn these man's ain't
