[Verse 1:]
Don't be trying to touch my cream
Got the mask in the machine
In the trap with my team
Getting closer to top of this uh
Now go find you a coffin, bitch
Hey, competition is the mirror, ho
Call me Coca, call me original, bitch
So natural
Shoe, game always magical, uh
Got the flow of a 90's kid
Whip out white, this easy shit, hey
Rap gonna keep me rich
Finna end your career, you sleepy bitch
Trust! Better quit that act
Fake ass jewels I strip that ass
All these hoes is punks
Let me make my money and smoke my skunk like

[Bridge: x2]
Where the hoes? I'm a call some
All the way up from Brooklyn to Compton? Yeah!
Where the hoes? I'm a call some
All the way up from Brooklyn to Compton? Yeah!

[Hook: x2]
I'm Coca pimpin
(And that's how I do it, ho!)
Pimping, pimping
(And that's how I do it, ho!)
I'm Coca pimpin
(And that's how I do it, ho!)
I'm Pimping, I'm pimping
(And that's how I do it, ho!)

[Verse 2:]
Uh, fuck around, I'm  the wrong one
Turn you to a fan when the song done
Where the hoes? I'm a call some
All the way up from Brooklyn to Compton? Yeah!
Check the all black Jesus piece
Kids with gold teeth at my meeting greet uh
All my goldies hold it down!
Hit the islands now, I'm golden brown!
Cut the fuck shit, not tonight
Rather play station and eat some rice, word
They love the fashion bite
They just can't live my faster life!
My wardrobe mean as fuck
Got a new chain, it's clean as fuck!
Used to run from the cops
I'm still Honey C from the block like

[Bridge: x2]
Where the hoes? I'm a call some
All the way up from Brooklyn to Compton? Yeah!
Where the hoes? I'm a call some
All the way up from Brooklyn to Compton? Yeah!

[Hook: x2]
I'm Coca pimpin
(And that's how I do it, ho!)
Pimping, pimping
(And that's how I do it, ho!)
I'm Coca pimpin
(And that's how I do it, ho!)
I'm Pimping, I'm pimping
(And that's how I do it, ho!)

Compton...
