They say we too skinny, too fat, too tall, too short
And we gotta eat less or we gotta eat more
We gotta buy this just to look like that
We gotta wear this and we gotta wear that
And whatever we put on, then we better look nice
If we wanna do our hair, then we better do it right
And make-up make you pretty, so everybody uses it
If you got a lot of weight
Then you better hope you lose it
Cuz boys don't love that, the boys love body
Focus on looking nice, and forget your other hobbies
Fuck school, they say, fuck science, fuck math
They just wanna look good, they say fuck all of that
And even if it's bad, they still say do it
If it means getting noticed then why not do it right?
Nawh, I don't give a fuck how I look
They can run with the boys, while I run with my books

If I'm small, then I'm small, if I'm tall then I am
If I'm big, then I'm big, if I'm skinny then I am
If I'm small, then I'm small, if I'm tall then I am
If I'm big, then I'm big, if I'm skinny then I am
I don't give a fuck what any of y'all think
I don't give a fuck what none of y'all think
Just let me be, man
I don't give a fuck what any of y'all think
I don't give a fuck what none of y'all think
Just let me be, man

I don't give a fuck what I see
When I look in the mirror
I can't change the girl that I see in the mirror
I don't give a fuck if the boys don't want me
I'm good on my own
I don't need y'all to flaunt me
I don't give a fuck if them other girls better
If they prettier or cuter, to me, it's just whatever
Cuz I rather be real, I don't want to be plastic
I don't want the drama, so all y'all can have it
I'd rather be locked in my room with myself
I'd rather be sad if it was better for my health
I don't care about clothes, I don't care about money
Say you gotta do this or that, it's just money
But I'll do what I please for your own bank
I'mma do me, I don't care what they say, shit!
I don't give a fuck how I look
They can run with the boys, while I run with my books
And I'm gone, and I'm gone, runnin' runnin' runnin' and I'm gone
And I'm gone, and I'm gone, well I'm gone cuz I'm gone

If I'm small, then I'm small, if I'm tall then I am
If I'm big, then I'm big, if I'm skinny then I am
If I'm small, then I'm small, if I'm tall then I am
If I'm big, then I'm big, if I'm skinny then I am
I don't give a fuck what any of y'all think
I don't give a fuck what none of y'all think
Just let me be, man
I don't give a fuck what any of y'all think
I don't give a fuck what none of y'all think
Just let me be, man
