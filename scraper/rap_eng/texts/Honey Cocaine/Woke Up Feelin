[Intro]
Yeah, Honey

[Verse 1]
Yeah, young Honey, you cold like this
That’s what happens when you grow like this
But I’m never gonna hold nothing back
The old me, I’ma go right back
Yeah, I had to change, ‘fore I got worse
C’s on the purse, it’s just what I deserve
I bought a chain, me, cause I did the work
Word, now I just put myself first
I’m ‘bout the cash, Villy, Versace, my rack
Gucci is all on the bag
You bitches all in the past, I’m living fast
Honey, she feeling like crap

[Chorus]
I woke up feeling like I don’t need none of you bitches
If you never held me down like I did for you, cool with it
Fuck with myself, I ain’t get that in a cool minute
Cause I love that feeling like I don’t need none of you bitches
I woke up feeling like I don’t need none of you bitches
If you never held me down like I did for you, cool with it
Fuck with myself, I ain’t get that in a cool minute
Cause I love that feeling like I don’t need none of you bitches

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I remember days in the six, on the bus, own whip now
Now I’m on the strip, in a truck, and they wanna take a pic now
Young lil’ Honey from the Jane, and I’m ‘bout to get big now
Hundred G’s for a sit down, that’s why they on my dick now
Laugh at a bitch who waste time
Won’t cry about it, ‘bout it, won’t waste mine
If you want work, hit my line
Beauty and a beast, for the one time
I break it down, just to rake it up
I hit the ground, when I’m waking up
I touch a town, just to fuck it up
I’m that bitch, they be talking ‘bout

[Chorus]
I woke up feeling like I don’t need none of you bitches
If you never held me down like I did for you, cool with it
Fuck with myself, I ain’t get that in a cool minute
Cause I love that feeling like I don’t need none of you bitches
I woke up feeling like I don’t need none of you bitches
If you never held me down like I did for you, cool with it
Fuck with myself, I ain’t get that in a cool minute
Cause I love that feeling like I don’t need none of you bitches
