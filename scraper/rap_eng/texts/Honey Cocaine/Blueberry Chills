[Chorus]
Strawberry fields, Cranberry wheels, Raspberry heels
Blueberry chills
Strawberry fields, Cranberry wheels, Raspberry heels
Blueberry chills
Strawberry fields, Cranberry wheels, Raspberry heels
Blueberry chills
Strawberry fields, Cranberry wheels, Raspberry heels
Blueberry chills

[Verse 1: Chanel West Coast]
This beat hit hard like mallets
Twenty fo', like karats
I stay smoking raw, organics
Like a chainsaw, trees vanish
Tell me your name, so I can forget it
I'm in the fast lane
And you at the exit

Blow past you bitches
While you blow for riches
I ball hard like bitches
You holdin' on like stitches
I'm taking off, no glitches
You behind me like hitches
Stay grindin' like bitches
In the eye lens like snitches

Cocaine white
C's in the Mclaren
Up all night
These speakers blaring
Keep it clean, like it's my parents
This my life, so you can stop staring

[Chorus]
Strawberry fields, Cranberry wheels, Raspberry heels
Blueberry chills
Strawberry fields, Cranberry wheels, Raspberry heels
Blueberry chills
Strawberry fields, Cranberry wheels, Raspberry heels
Blueberry chills
Strawberry fields, Cranberry wheels (yah), Raspberry heels (yah)
Blueberry chills

[Verse 2: Honey Cocaine]
Bitch I got some blue (blue)
Oh yeah I got some red (red)
Oh you ain't got my money? (huh?)
Then bitch I got your head (brrrat)
And I got the heater under my bed(for real)
Two seaters and I got jets (real talk)
I ain't wanna talk about numbers (nah)
Cause they might just call the feds (brrrat)
I know you out of your mind (uh)
And you know my pockets looking like lime (uh)
You only wasting my time
You a gangster online (online)
What you gonna do? (What you gonna do?)
Tweet at me? (Tweet at me?)
Take it to the hood bitch (for real)
Let the streets have me (brrrat)
Step up (bitch)
I got a down bitch Ima call her (uh)
I'm out of town with my ballers (uh)
And if you talk big money then holla (word)
Lil' fish, get ate hoe
I'm drunk as shit but I'm capable (hah)
I see it all in your face hoe
You ain't high, you a fake hoe (hahaha)

[Chorus]
Strawberry fields, Cranberry wheels (bitch), Raspberry heels (bitch)
Blueberry chills
Strawberry fields, Cranberry wheels (uh), Raspberry heels (uh)
Blueberry chills
(Uh, yeah)
Strawberry fields, Cranberry wheels, Raspberry heels
Blueberry chills
Strawberry fields, Cranberry wheels, Raspberry heels
Blueberry chills

[Verse 3: Chanel West Coast]
I don't need your opinion
You softer than minion filet, bay-bay
Fake homies get shitted on
Bossing, my flows be the tightest
Flossing, like I had gingivitis
Push back them hoes
Release day they froze
Th-Th-They on they toes, like tryna see the show

Get in line, like you at the DMV
It's my time, YMCMB
Homies need some checkin'
Like they carrying a weapon
Ain't no disrespecting
But yo clothes look like they slept in
Today you shoulda slept in
The master flow
Keep steppin'

[Chorus]
Strawberry fields, Cranberry wheels (bitch), Raspberry heels (bitch)
Blueberry chills
Strawberry fields, Cranberry wheels (uh), Raspberry heels (uh)
Blueberry chills
(Uh, yeah)
Strawberry fields, Cranberry wheels, Raspberry heels
Blueberry chills
Strawberry fields, Cranberry wheels, Raspberry heels
Blueberry chills
