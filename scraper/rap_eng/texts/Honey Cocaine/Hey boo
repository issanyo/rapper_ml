And all my bitches bad we getting cash
But we gonna spend it all tonight
So boo I’ll do what I want to with you

South side clubin, 90's night
And I’m at boo he was just my type
I asked em what’s his name and what he like
He answered me and said, you's a baby right?
I told em I’m 19 and live a gold ass life
But I’ll tell what the 90s like
And I am what these niggas like
Just get me one night, Asian and take the pipe
So what you’re waiting for?
You like my outfit’cause I’m from the north
Young goddess , I could buy the stores
Independent bitch, you can have yours
Shit, we ain’t got it, cup from the club
We can party and drink
But if I make a move what the party gonna think still
It’s whatever ’cause the party is shit
And I’ma show you the keys
And you show me your dick ey

Tell all your homies we gonna be alone
Is our zone you found a gold as bitch
Two times gor a gold ass bitch

Chorus:
Hey boo, what’s up? I don’t do love
So we can fuck
We gonna do it all night
You smoke, I smoke, you drink me too, well good
Let’s get drunk tonight
And all my bitches bad we getting cash
But we gonna spend it all tonight
So boo I’ll do what I want to with you
We gonna have fun tonight
