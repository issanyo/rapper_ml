[Verse 1]
Tryna get me pressed, I don't think you should
Fucking with my family? I wish you would
A couple dumb bitches got smacked for that
That's why I got the motherfucking mac for that
You lay flat for that, think it's a joke my goon?
Rip the homie he done left so soon
24 karats when I enter the room
My style so original, click clack boom
Hoes gon' be hoes for sure
That's fine by me, bitch know your role
My bitches so gangsta but still got class
My niggas getting money, they ain't worried bout ass

[Hook:]
It's God damn town, bitch I parked in
Coming like 100g's in a compartment
My homies got the keys to my apartment
I remember the days when I was starving
All my same homies in the back, wassup
Got all the same homies in the back, wassup
All my same homies in the back, wassup
Putting all the asians on the map

[Verse 2]
Honey finna make hits this year
Holler at me hater only God I fear
Survived all the pain, I'm just starting my 20's
Who the fuck thought I'd be a star when I'm 20?
Gold gang, motherfuckers know who we are
Set a few goals to bring my company far
Young cocoa, report to I
Wearing things you prolly can't afford to buy
But it's cool, all the shit don't come over night
Fuck what they think, we gon' show up and fight
Bitches wildin' out, I'm a don your runs
Fuck tryna argue, I'm about my funds

[Hook:]
Jusr got downtown, bitch I parked in
Coming like 100g's in a compartment
My homies got the keys to my apartment
I remember the days when I was starving
All my same homies in the back, wassup
Got all the same homies in the back, wassup
All my same homies in the back, wassup
Putting all the asians on the map
