[Intro]
Yeah uh

[Verse 1]
I chase money in the fast lane
I was already balling when the cash came
Now he tryna holla but I'm laughing
Cause ain't no nigga finna trade my last name
Fuck boss shit, I ain't never lie
Still on the game bitch I ain't never hide
416 on my game till I die
(Came to the money and it came wit a price)
I keep it too real on these hoes
Got a deal on the low
And I'm still in control
Listen I ain't feeling you doe
I’m a goal setter go-getter
Killing the show
Without a school and I'm still on the road
But It's cool cause I'm still getting dough
Competing with me is a stretch for these hoes
Hit the west cause it's cold
I'm just destined for gold

[Hook]
Tell these hoes get away from me
Walk through and they wave at me
Your sad cause your bitch ain’t me
I'm getting money you ain’t gotta act shady wit me
I ain't doing shit for free
Cause ain't nobody did shit for me
Ain't no ho getting rich from me
I'm too real you ain't gotta act shady wit me

[Verse 2]
Now I’m shining and them niggas shady
Well bout time I swear this shit is crazy
Ain’t stressing bout em ain't no fucking maybe
I'm independent can't no nigga save me
Anything I wanted I done work for it
Just look at my life
Don't take my word for it
Drop the shit and throw a hella thought for it
Its get or die motherfucker or I'ma show for it
Had a dream and achieved that shit
She an undercover fan don't believe that bitch
She be shady all the time nigga leave that bitch
Hear my song while I'm shopping like me that bitch
My team fly homie we that shit
(Charisma calling like I need that hit)
I smoke a roach like I need that hit
Tell her fuck it lets go homie we got this

[Hook]
Tell these hoes get away from me
Walk through and they wave at me
Your sad cause your bitch ain’t me
I'm getting money you ain’t gotta act shady wit me
I ain't doing shit for free
Cause ain't nobody did shit for me
Ain't no ho getting rich from me
I'm too real you ain't gotta act shady wit me
