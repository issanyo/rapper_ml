Verse 1
I'm at the club, all yellow like a taxi
Bitches all love the shit, catch you when you catch me
Fuck it, then where the cash be, money like a mad pussy
If you acting like star then get the bitch a cab please

Like, like bitch please
You ain't all that, your shit's weak
Cut a cheque or bitch just breathe
We ain't friends, let a bitch free

Uh, we got the partying down like what
Money up the ass, I'm a boss, what's up?
Cars so foreign, and cars like huh?
Pour one sixth, I'm in the dark like fuck

Pre-chorus
I comes through while frozen, fire all potent
All my bitches blonde and the jewels all golden
They're playing my song, got the bottle and the potion
Tell them bitches go home and fuck your emotions

Verse 2
Game shook, it's all over the ???
Ya went broke just buying where I been at
Fuck these groupie ass niggas, woulda been past
And rap bitches saying shit but you've been ass

You get the message bitch, you is not important
If we give a damn about the fame but I'm touring
All these rappers ain't shit and it's boring
So we at the club, get it lit and gets to pouring

Pre-chorus
I comes through while frozen, fire all potent
All my bitches blonde and the jewels all golden
They're playing my song, got the bottle and the potion
Tell them bitches go home and fuck your emotions
