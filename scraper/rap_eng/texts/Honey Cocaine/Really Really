(Verse)
Money on my mind, I don’t fuck with scrubs
Everything crisp, never fucking up
This is why the world show me lots of love
Ok, rookie in the game but I’m jumping up
80 for the week, got some money to dump
You floss at the club, but you’re broke all month
Thristy ass niggas want something to hump
Tell the DJ that Honey Cocaine shit bump
Shoppin in Milan with my 7’s on
Smack a bitch straight, don’t get me wrong
I don’t like to stunt, though my money is long
Rather do shows than just rap these songs
Haters tryina plot, the world is cold
Money make a fool when they sell they soul
Not me nigga, my mind is gold
Stay G, stay true, even if I’m broke

(Bridge)
You’re burnt out, you’re burnt out
Ah, better work bitch, better sweat your perm out
Your perm out, hahaha, ah
You’re burnt out, you’re burnt out
Ah, better work bitch, better sweat your perm out
Your perm out, ah

(Hook)
You ain’t never had a real bitch (alright, alright)
I think rap really really needs a real bitch (alright, alright)
The real bitches gon feel this (alright, alright)
I think rap really really needs real bitch (alright, alright)

(Verse)
Fuckin with me ain’t good for your health
You mad when I’m doing, something good for myself
Hold it down, either way bitch, fuck your health
Ain’t gotta act fake, or my homies can tell
I really hate a lazy bitch
Bring me one of those, I'll shake the bitch
Ambition is the one thing that made me rich
And man every day I was just game with it
I hope these sluts learn from me
Join the honey team, I turn you G
Shut up when a real bitch speak
Got a problem with me, I wet you in yo sleep
Ha, and I put that on rap, I don’t give a damn if you think you bad
Bitch I ain’t your friend, I ain’t smiling back
Get the fuck out my face, with all of that

(Bridge)
You’re burnt out, you’re burnt out
Ah, better work bitch, better switch your perm out
Your perm out, hahaha, ah
You’re burnt out, you’re burnt out
Ah, better work bitch, better switch your perm out
Your perm out, ah

(Hook)
You ain’t never had a real bitch (alright, alright)
I think rap really really needs a real bitch (alright, alright)
And real bitches gon feel this (alright, alright)
I think rap really really needs real bitch (alright, alright)
