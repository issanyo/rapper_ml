[Verse 1]
Cheap ass hoes, fucking weak ass hoes
Heard you claim you finna smack me?
Let's see how that goes
Why you're tryin' to lie 'bout it?
Bitch my street ass knows
Now I never like to brag but pass me my gold
I got some 12's on, coca the wrong one to tell on
Fuck a label, put my self on
Bitch gettin' paper through my cell phone
For real
This is why them other hoes is under me
Bring a fucking army if you come for me
I'll choke you the fuck out if you wondering
No feelings for you faggots
What the fuck you even done for me?

[Hook:]
Uh, 40 hoes they all bomb
Hungry bitch get your chump on
Disrespect me and get stomped on
Bitch you heard about that wonton
That wonton, that wonton
I heard them bitches love that wonton
That wonton, that wonton
Holla at me for that wonton

[Verse 2]
I heard it's coca getting stuck in your nose
Honey whatever you like, I got it all for the low
You respect me I respect you, bitch the drama is old
If you're pushing me in these open streets
I'll drop you in front of your door
Like knock knock, saw you snitchin;
Give a fuck bout what the cops got
It ain't a game bring your ass to my chop shop
Like fuck the fame and fuck a top spot, bitch
Devil all in my ear
Hand all on my nine, I've been fresh 20 years
I should have seen the signs, ain't it weird how they doubted  me?
Now motherfuckers tryna shout for me
It's no hate but I don't fuck with you
At least I'll say look out for me

[Hook]
Uh, 40 hoes they all bomb
Hungry bitch get your chump on
Disrespect me and get stomped on
Bitch you heard about that wonton
That wonton, that wonton
I heard them bitches love that wonton
That wonton, that wonton
Holla at me for that wonton
