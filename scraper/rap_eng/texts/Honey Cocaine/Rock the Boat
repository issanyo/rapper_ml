[Verse 1]
Aye, bae, how you doing today?
I got something I would love to put you in today
But shit you wanna play
Why you actin like you busy meet me half way
Cause I'm a feen all day
With a Gold ass body let it love your face
Lets do it outside at the beach
Let me tell you about Asians: we freaks
Damn it's what you doing to me
AI don't want shit my loving is free
I'ma make you feel so addicted
So if I ain't home you gon’ miss it
Is you with it? I hope
Just taste my ocean and rock my boat
I said, Is you with it? I hope
Just taste my ocean and rock my boat (let's go)

[Hook]
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat

[Verse 2]
He rocked once he gon’ rock it twice
Three times for the bitches who can rock the pipe
Fuck it, I ain't trying to work today
I'm just trying to love, smoke weed today
Damn, what a perfect day
But let me hit the studio, it’s worth the wait
You deserve it like nobody else
So I let you have honey all to yourself
Cocaine love , you just won’t get enough
And this what all them other niggas trying to touch
But I don’t mess with niggas cause they ain't like you
No other No body can compare to you
Is you with it? I hope
Just taste my ocean and rock my boat
I said, is you with it? I hope
Just taste my ocean and rock my boat (let's go)

[Hook]
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
