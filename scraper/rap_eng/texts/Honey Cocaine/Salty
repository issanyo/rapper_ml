[Chorus]
If the boy salty, the boy poison
He saucy?
Then just 'void 'em
He got you feelin' salty?
Then he poison
Stop fucking with the boy he poison

[Verse 1]
Salty motherfuckers keep me hydrated
Put my phone in my pussy when it's vibrating
Ring-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-off
Bloody birds keep calling, get to migrating
Cause I ain't spending, let you fuck, gotta get these bucks
Okay it's all in the back, put this in the truck
If I see the boy enroll then I might duck
The other day we got to it, it was bad luck
Uh, I feel like selling you a two piece of the tea
I shoulda gave my number when I met you at the beach
Block, block, block, block, block, delete
Dudes be the new bitches, ha, preach

[Hook]
If the boy salty, the boy poison
If the boy salty, the boy poison

[Chorus]
If the boy salty, the boy poison
He saucy?
Then just 'void 'em
He got you feelin' salty?
Then he poison
Stop fucking with the boy he poison

[Verse 2]
Salty motherfuckers is all I see
Okay, my money and my goals is all I be
So when it comes to you hoes it R.I.P. (Bye)
Bitches can’t get a dollar from me
I've been grindin' and whilin' fuck how you feel (Lil bitch)
I just came for banana I gotta peel (Real quick)
You ain't paying my bills, shut up, chill
Bitch you should be grateful, you had a mill
Young savage, self established
To curve a mothafucka it don’t take no practice
Your lil boy games, man I've been past it
The little dick picks, I might get to blastin'

[Hook]
If the boy salty, the boy poison
If the boy salty, the boy poison

[Bridge]
Bro, make your bed in the friendzone
I don't need no loser to depend on
Bro, make your bed in the friendzone
I don't need no loser to depend on
Bro
