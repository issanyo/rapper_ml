[Verse 1]
All black whips when we come through
Don't you dare wild out or get kung fu'd
Well connected, who the hell you gon' run to?
Hoes never learn, heard the big homie pumped you?
Fuck a knife bitch fight me instead
Actin like you brave, get a price on your head
Bitches who throwing punches get the most respect
Stay talking, don't get chopped from your legs
You a bitch raise your top off
Catch you round my way and get you chopped off
Yeah that honey twisted I am not soft
Screw face 24/7, don't get locked off

[Hook:]
If I wasn't humble, I done been shut your shit up
Yeah I done been toss your shit up
Bitch I done been shut your shit up
Please don't push me, push me
Cause even the humblest of the humble got their days sometimes, nigga
Please don't push me, push me
Cause even the humblest of the humble got their days sometimes, nigga


[verse 2]
The game done taught me all these niggas is bitch
See how I caught a bullet? Give a fuck if you rich
None of these hoes loyal, all these hoes is pricks
Cause where the fuck's your honor, bitch you scared and ditched?
What, you should have been got your throat cut
It's why you quiet every time coca show up
Now you hating, let me ask you homie for what?
You ain't close to real, homie the jokes up
Forgot when I gave you a pass?
Told the homies chill, bitch I saved your ass
It would have been ugly, I won't lie to you
You a bitch but I told you I'mma ride for you

[Hook:]
If I wasn't humble, I done been shut your shit up
Yeah I done been toss your shit up
Bitch I done been shut your shit up
Please don't push me, push me
Cause even the humblest of the humble got their days sometimes, nigga
Please don't push me, push me
Cause even the humblest of the humble got their days sometimes, nigga
