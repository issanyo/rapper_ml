[Intro]
Ooh wee, Cierra
Take a sip with me
Young Honey, faded
Take a sip with me, faded
Take a sip with me, faded
Your lips on me now

[Verse 1: Cierra Ramirez]
I can see you now with your hands on me
Glass half full, but your cup empty
You can be my Jack, I can be your Brandy
What you know about that, know about that?
Clink clink, lemon drop to the floor
Ooh we slow wine, sipping Bordeaux
Take another sip, now we moving slow-mo
What you know about that, what you know about that?

[Pre-Chorus: Cierra Ramirez]
So intoxicated tonight
So let's get lost, get under the lights

[Chorus: Cierra Ramirez]
Hurry up, hurry up, come get it, babe
Bottoms up, bottoms up, know you're thirsty
Your lips on me, now we faded
Hurry up, hurry up, come get it, babe
One, two, body shocked when you kiss me
Your lips on me, now we faded
Yeah, faded, yeah, faded

[Verse 2: Honey Cocaine]
Get a little faded, get a little buzzed
We could shoot it straight or chase it with some love
Running outrageous, we don't give a fuck
Even when we faded out, it still ain't enough
Honey Jack [?] until we catching a wave
Bottles coming in like a fucking parade
I like him cause he killing, do nothing but slay
And when he lick it all, I got nothing to say

[Verse 3: Cierra Ramirez]
Hold up, hand me your keys
So so drunk, drunk, sex on the beach
Feel it, warm it up like we down in Belize
What you know about that, know about that?
Stay on one, we be up all night
One more round, baby, I just might
One more round, baby, I just might
What you know about that, know about that?

[Pre-Chorus: Cierra Ramirez]
Because we so intoxicated tonight
So let's get lost, get under the lights

[Chorus: Cierra Ramirez]
Hurry up, hurry up, come get it, babe
Bottoms up, bottoms up, know you're thirsty
Your lips on me, now we faded
Hurry up, hurry up, come get it, babe
One, two, body shocked when you kiss me
Your lips on me, now we faded

[Bridge: Cierra Ramirez]
So faded, faded, so faded, faded
Your lips on me, now we faded

[Verse 4: Casey Veggies]
She said she feel that this lifestyle so jaded
When I'm with you, I can't lie, girl, I feel amazing
Can't judge you by your cover, gotta flip the pages
Find out what it is that's gon' make me stay here
Popping bottles of champagne, girl, you represent the game
You just staying in your lane, chilling, getting faded
From the way you say your name to them heels in your frame
I just wanna take you home and facilitate it
Everybody looking at us like we really made it
Every night, we popping bottles like we celebrating
And my girl black and white, no segregation
And I'm going for the kill, no hesitation

[Pre-Chorus: Cierra Ramirez]
So intoxicated tonight
So let's get lost, get under the lights (Oh, man)

[Chorus: Cierra Ramirez]
Hurry up, hurry up, come get it, babe
Bottoms up, bottoms up, know you're thirsty
Your lips on me, now we faded
Hurry up, hurry up, come get it, babe
One, two, body shocked when you kiss me
Your lips on me (your lips on me), now we faded

[Outro: Cierra Ramirez]
Take a sip with me, faded
Take a sip with me, faded
Your lips on me, now we faded
