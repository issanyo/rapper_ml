[Hook]
I thought I told you sucka's
I guess I'll show you sucka's
I thought I told you sucka's
I guess I'll show you sucka's

[Verse 1]
You act like I owe you sucka's
You must be dreaming homie
Now I control you sucka's
While I be queenin' homie
What you gon' do about it?
If I'm the boss of you
You trying to be like me babe
You can't do what I do
Bet if you visit my block
You’ll probably shit yo clothes
And all my bitches gold
But you act like you just don’t know

[Hook]
You hypnotize, you hypnotize, you hypnotize, you hypnotize

[Hook]
I thought I told you sucka's
I guess I'll show you sucka's
I thought I told you sucka's
I guess I'll show you sucka's

[Verse 2]
I’m just a golden goddess
I know you sucka’s want it
Bitch all my jewels are bought’d
Me and my circle got it
I’m selling at yo college
I got the things you need
So you can hit my phone
But I don’t like police
Cause I ain’t bout these damn games
I work until I sweat
And if you speaking my name
Make sure you pay respect

[Hook]
You hypnotize, you hypnotize, you hypnotize, you hypnotize

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, hehe
You are now under the influence of Honey Cocaine
And I am, over, over you
Sounded like a, goddess
And you will obey, just because
Ha ha ha ha
