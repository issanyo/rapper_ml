[Hook: Honey Cocaine]
Met him on a Monday
(yeah x4)
Caught a matinee on Wednesday
(yeah x4)
Melrose on a Friday
(yeah x4)
Cuddled up on a Sunday. I let him lick the cherry on Sunday
(ooh)

[Verse 1: Honey Cocaine]
I'm feelin' amazin'. This is a rare occasion. Young beautiful Asian
Uhh, top back in the Winter time. LA shit blowin' weed 'til I get [?]
Just started but I'm feelin' like I'm in my prime
No tie but you know I'm seein' dolla signs
Cocaine inside, doors doin' suicide
Rollin' through your block music loud like I broke a knob
Bitches hatin' like they own the block
Wake up on my dick, you should get a job
My bad I should really stop, but the game changed up since they killed Pac
Bet I'm doin' good livin' like I should
And my nigga do me good, yeah he do me good
So good no splinter when he give me wood
Flew straight from the 6 down to Hollywood

[Hook 2: Honey Cocaine]
Met him on a Monday
P-Pops up a club on Tuesday
(yeah x4)
Caught a matinee on Wednesday
Then we pillow talk on Thursday
(yeah x4)
Melrose on a Friday
Late night berries on Saturday
(yeah x4)
Cuddled up on a Sunday
I let him lick the cherry on Sunday
(ooh)

[Verse 2: Honey Cocaine]
We chillin' and we vibin'
Spoon me to sleep, think he slick try to slide in
Make a bitch breakfast, we don't even dine in
Call him Trey Songz cause he always tryna dive in
Lean back at it, like a crack addict
Honey Cocaine never gonna throw shade
Thirsty ass hoes tryna sneak it's a damn shame
But I don't give a fuck, got him hooked like a chain
I'm so into you. I'm so into you
What the fuck am I gonna do? What the fuck am I gonna do?
When we ain't grindin' you know that we grindin'
Gotta get mine in 'til the sun shinin'
(good morning to you, the birds are chirpin')

[Hook 2]

[Outro: Honey Cocaine]
I let him, I let him, l-let him lick, lick, lick, lick, lick
Let him, let him lick, lick, lick, lick, lick
Sun-Sunday, Sun-Sunday
(x2)
