[ Freestyle ]

Tell these bitches I'm queen
Tell these bitches I'm gold
If you been where I been, then you'll probably drink cold
I give a fuck bout' you bitches who got a problem with me
I do shit for myself, nobody got it for me
You got a issue with me, but you ain't licensed to speak
Cause I be feedin' the streets, yo ass is nothing to me
I been hot with the lyrics, and I been dope with the fashion
I said I want It I need It, I done spoke it to actions
And when you talkin' I'm workin', I'm gettin' things I'm deservin'
But at a point I was hurtin' and gettin' nothing like virgins
I be takin' my time, I'm only 20 years old
Nobody fuckin' with coca, I tell them sucka's go home
Bitch I'm hype cause I'm certified
All my bitches qualified
Fuckin' with my team,finna get yo face modified
What you comin' for me, I ain't scared fam
I eat them J's off your feet with my bare hands
Stupid ass bitch just stop
Cause I ain't finna tolerate the shit you talk
Unless the bitch a boss, she gettin' bossed
They said coca be on and bitch you not
I be bout it but I ain't the type to start shit
Asian bitch, never a fool, always some smart shit
Who you playin' I don't learn the game
Nobody teachin' me shit, cause me and you not the same
So get to suckin' bitch you talkin' to much
You get a bit of fuckin' fame think you popular
You twerkin' for a name, nigga's bought you stuff
I make my own damn money and I shop enough
They say I lie about the shit I do
Now you flexin' cause coca ain't fuckin' with you
Bitch swerve I make moves It's the truth
This the mafia bitch who you
