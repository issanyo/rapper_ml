Uh
I need a moment for the moments I needed
This is fate, I believe it
They say that death can be cheated
I lived the life of a queen
Put my heart up with dreams
God will protect my achievements cause nothing is what it seems
Got ambition and passion, don't act like it's a surprise
They expected my weakness but I managed to survive
Feel determined yet hopeless and it's a shame that you're gone
You was troubled with battles but you an angel to one
I have conquered my struggles, I been blamed and named
Yet I wouldn't know success if I didn't know pain
It ain't nobody's fault, they just made it a problem
How the fuck they gon' progress if society got 'em
Crave security and unity, thinkin' they defeated me
God made his children with his beautiful purity
I tell my spirit don't fail me now
We've all got our battles and challenges somehow
I was destined for greatness with the soul of a king
I don't curse none of my enemies, I let them sing
The voice of the young and building with fuckin honor
With an angel who supports me and made me stronger
Who knew about your issues, they were secrets you kept
Don't be worried bout our friendship homie I won't forget
Some people stayed in the dark and act like shit is alright
Your everything just seems wrong and they straight from the lights
Fuck...

My bad yo..
Alright let's start from here

...Lose our own fights
And we argue our fate
I will remember your face but you at a better place
Till then I'll pray
Someday I'll be with you anyway
You told me I was the greatest so I guess I'll be okay
