(Verse 1)
Fuck out of my way you ain’t touching my yay
Tired these hoes pack up
Send it out of the state
Toronto's where I stay, 416 all day
All my niggas Cambodian and those niggas don’t play
White sparks in my tray, high the rest of my Js
Fuck police you faggot hoes, we put it in your graves
Who the fuck gon stop me? More money I crave
Bitch you ain’t in my lane, don’t you ever come to Jane
In the hood I ain’t laugh ho, fuckin with me you death ho
Shoot you in your rental, 90’s kids, we retro
Now tell me who’s colder than me
Bitch don’t touch my jewelry is older than me

(Hook)
Chichi get the yayo, bitch
Chichi get the yayo
Chichi get the yayo, bitch
Chichi get the yayo, bitch
Chichi get the yayo
Chichi get the yayo, bitch
Chichi get the yayo
Chichi get the yayo, Honey
Chichi get the yayo, Honey
Chichi get the yayo, bitch
Chichi get the yayo
Chichi get the yayo, Honey

(Verse 2)
8 ball of the dust, you rap bitch is rust
You hoes talk too much, the reason I don’t trust
My career my main concern, shut the fuck up it ain’t your turn
Humble ass kid I came to learn
But I’ll smack a ho, if she claim my words
I’m about these commas bitch period
So don’t ask me why I’m so serious
50 fuckin K is what my earrings is
If you hatin you can exit at the nearest shit
It ain’t no joke fam, growing up my broke fam
Ain’t even have no Christmases, so I tolerate from no man
Who knew the little girl woulda hang, bitch
In and out of school and still manage to slang bitch

(Hook)
Chichi get the yayo, bitch
Chichi get the yayo
Chichi get the yayo, bitch
Chichi get the yayo, bitch
Chichi get the yayo
Chichi get the yayo, bitch
Chichi get the yayo
Chichi get the yayo, Honey
Chichi get the yayo, Honey
Chichi get the yayo, bitch
Chichi get the yayo
Chichi get the yayo, Honey
