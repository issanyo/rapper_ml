[Intro]
Can't get along with 'em
Can't get along with 'em
Nah, nah

[Verse 1]
My mentality is way before my time
How the fuck I got so far, I'm way before my prime
I be chasing dreams while all you suckers stand in line
I say fuck them bitches, I'm gon' take whatever's mine
Boss affiliated, I'm protected every coast
Shout outs to my ballers and my niggas, we so close
They showed me these boys they ain't no man they fuckin' jokes
So I stuck to the dope and I keep one tucked in my coat
What about you, nigga?
Never robbed none, never popped one
Never dropped none, never shot none
Never got one, you ain't cop none
You a flop son, nigga stop frontin'
Niggas toupee that moue
Can't souffl√©, fuck a new case
No groupies, ain't a new wave
Anybody say I changed never knew H
These bitches is weak
All copying Honey but these bitches ain't sweet
When I spit fire don't speak
We don't get tired, no sleep
He said each other, no me
Man, these thirsty fuck niggas on fleek

[Pre-Hook] (x2)
Hoes talking down on me
I got them rounds on me
All pounds for me
And I don't like anybody I meet

[Hook]
I don't mess with these hoes
Can't get along with 'em
Can't get along with 'em
Can't get along with 'em
Just don't get along with 'em
I don't mess with these hoes

[Verse 2]
Look at these hoes
Livin' their live
This bitch done fuck the whole team
And you made her your wife?
Shout out you crusty ass niggas
You stay good and played every night
That bitch is nasty
If I had a dick, I still wouldn't give her the pipe
I don't fuck with these hoes
And I don't fuck with niggas who fuckin' these hoes
Fuck are them niggas who coppin' these hoes
Bitches ain't loyal they're bluffin' for show
You just as weak as the pussy you hitting
Who the hell you think you kidding?
When I come through all them bitches is sittin'
She [?] can't make no decisions
Hoes fake like a spray tan
Can't deal with a waste man
Mother fuck your Ray bans
I used to rob hoes at the station
But I'm too broke for that
High school shit, too stoned for that
You bro actin' like a [?]
Thirst on sumo, we don't get along for that
Tell 'em suck a dick
[?] then I send 'em in a lift
That's it, shit
Baby boy boy don't trip
Your bitch is [?] know how good you lick
