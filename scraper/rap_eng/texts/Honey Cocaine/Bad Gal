[Verse 1]
Yo, play the game with no problems
The whole fam slanged, bitch I came from the bottom
Always in my thang now I got em
They ask me for trouble, I just aim then I shot em
Fuck all the small talk in there
89 asians when I walk in there
Jay's ain't even out but I got me a pair
Coca unexpected, you not prepared
Ah, can't stop the ambition ho
All my niggas boss, I don't kiss these hoes
All these cats pussy, you fishy ho
Fuck you dirty bitches, what you trippin' for?

[Bridge:]
Don't test me, I might bring the fire out
Go and dare, me and my ninjas finna wild out
If I like it, I'mma buy it out
Do it like a g, bitch go ahead dry it out
Fuck all the small talk in there
89 asians when I walk in there
Fuck all the small talk in there
89 asians when I walk in there

[Hook:]
Lil' nigga you ain't shit, you ain't with what I'm with
And your ass ain't sitting with me
Lil' nigga I'm the choice, all my chips gonna do it
Just watch bitch I do it like a g
I do it like a g, I'm a bad gal
I do it like a g, I'm a bad gal
Said I do it like a g, I'm a bad gal
Bitch I do it for the streets, I'm a bad gal

[Verse 2]
Okay, love ain't better than money
In the studio, drinking lemon and honey
Appetite green, presidents in my tummy
Hoes signin' dummy, got the led for you dummies
You my students, better listen kid
Fuck around kill you a predicaments
Ah,hope the fucking clip ain't in
Shooting toes off, give your ass a trim
Put another one in your spine
Bitch you ain't a queen, only in your mind
Fronting like you bad, do it in your time
Got the gat all ready if you cross the line
Lil bitch don't test me

[Bridge:]
Don't test me, I might bring the fire out
Go and dare, me and my ninjas finna wild out
If I like it, I'mma buy it out
Do it like a g, bitch go ahead dry it out
Fuck all the small talk in there
89 asians when I walk in there
Fuck all the small talk in there
89 asians when I walk in there

[Hook:]
Lil' nigga you ain't shit, you ain't with what I'm with
And your ass ain't sitting with me
Lil' nigga I'm the choice, all my chips gonna do it
Just watch bitch I do it like a g

I do it like a g, I'm a bad gal
Said I do it like a g, I'm a bad gal
Bitch I do it for the streets, I'm a bad gal
