[Verse 1: Tinashe]
I know that you miss me baby
I can make you weak
And if you dive in like you did, you'd never see the end of the sea
I know that you like it daddy
You’re the boss of me

[Chorus: Tinashe]
I know that you hate it when you see me with those other niggas easy
Hate it when you see me shittin' on your wanna-be me
Hate it when you see me rollin' up in my new whip
Won’t you tell me babe now who's the boss of this?

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
Thought that you'd forget about me
Fuck you think I am?
Fuck you think I am, I am, I am
Fuck you think I am, I am, I am
You gon' spend forever sitting thinkin' 'bout me wishing you were still my man
I know that you like it daddy
When I ask you please

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Fuck you think I am?
Disrespecting me
Now the queen got other plans so why you texting me?

[Verse 3: Honey Cocaine]
Uh, it's too late now boy huh?
It's too early for your noise huh?
Your old girl wasn't shit to me
Your new girl ain't doing shit to me
So why you calling, why you calling like I care still?
Why you calling, why you calling like I care still?
Why you calling, why you calling like I care still?
You know, uh
Mr.fuck boy, you ain't got no luck boy
So keep it moving or stay stuck boy, fuck boy
I ain't waiting , that's time wasted
I broke your heart, that's a crime ain't it?
Well this the boss and she a criminal
My money maximum, your bitch minimum Simple

Why you gotta make it complicated?
Now I don't love you I don't love you & I know you hate it

[Chorus]
