[Verse 1: Honey Cocaine]
Gold bricks to the ceiling
It's dope fuck your feelings
Kickin’ it with my gangster bitch
Trap gang got her dealing
Queen since I was born
Scars all in my arm
Tell your ho she’s been warned
Tanning somewhere that’s warm
Gripping a trigger, as I get bigger, I don’t trust these hoes
Damage my liver, drinking some liquor, parties on my boat
Call me the boss, fuck what it cost, animals on my coat
If I get crossed, you will get tossed, bullets in your throat
Smoke all in my lungs
Bags all in my trunk
G’s all in my circle, like rum, pum pum pum pum
Bitch, slow it down
No doubt ‘cause I’mma be rich
While you bitches just stand around waitin’ for some dick
Uhh !

[Hook:]
I am the one, get you a gun, bitch, I’m with my clique
Don’t act dumb, I ain’t no fun, bitch, I’m chasing chips
This is the team, this is the fam’, this is 416
Yeah we get green, yeah we go HAM, better shut your lips
All-white special chopper, talk to me you talk proper
All-white special chopper, talk to me you talk proper
All-white special chopper, talk to me you talk proper
All-white special chopper, talk to me you talk proper

[Verse 2:]
Welcome to my glory hole, who are all these foreign hoes?
Y’all bitches is all the same,real talk, y’all some boring hoes
All-white special chopper, talk to me, you talk proper
Fake rappers; impostors
All you sluts is dick hoppers
What you got to offer the game?
Bitches shaking ass just to get ‘em some fame
Never catch me hugging cause these bitches is lame
Asian don repping, got the flag in my chain
Gold all in my nail polish, watch me & Chanel ballin’
Heard them hoes done snitched me out
It’s cool, I still won’t tell on ‘em
But when I see you best believe it’s a fade
Best believe I am paid
Best believe you’ll get blazed, bitch !
Uhh !
