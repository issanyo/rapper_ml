[Chorus]
Cute lil bitch, I'ma need me a better man
Been with the shits, you can say I'm a veteran
Veteran, veteran, veteran
Veteran, veteran, veteran
Cute lil bitch, I'ma need me a better man
Been with the shits, you can say I'm a veteran
Veteran, veteran, veteran
Veteran, veteran, veteran

[Verse 1]
Lil Honey got a big ego
Came with the gas with the diesel
Take a bitch back, like repo
Ain't gotta fight, got an eagle
Y'ain't got tools, Home Depot
Louis V store for the reload
Re-up one time when the weed low - whoa
Light that shit, hype me up
Bitch, I'm back to flexing, it's a must
All this money shit, ridiculous
Weak hoes cannot sit with us - wait
Why yo new shit like my old shit
I just burned RIGHT thru a whole zip
I done been around the globe, bitch
All these on that bullshit

[Chorus]
Cute lil bitch, I'ma need me a better man
Been with the shits, you can say I'm a veteran
Veteran, veteran, veteran
Veteran, veteran, veteran
Cute lil bitch, I'ma need me a better man
Been with the shits, you can say I'm a veteran
Veteran, veteran, veteran

How you gonna talk about me?
You don't even know yourself
You don't even know what you know

[Verse 2]
Skinny gyal, thick in the pockets
Spend a few bands in the tropics
Swig til it make me feel nauseous
Put a broke bitch on the block list
Yea, bad gyal never take losses
Bad gyal on the taril of the profits
Dumb gyal never stop talking
Might have to buy her a coffin, yea
Life I live's like a drug
We do what we want just because
We poppin', we what they discuss
He taste me, he loving the buzz
Pussy turn a to a psycho
Swimming in the shit like Michael
Bird bitches know I got the rifle
Prolly just fuck him for the night tho

[Outro]
Cuz I'm a cute lil bitch and I need me a better man
Been with the shits, you can say I'm a veteran
