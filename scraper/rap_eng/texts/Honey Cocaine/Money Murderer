Back in my zone, and I'm killing the raps
Leave me alone, little son, less you talkin bout facts
Got some gold in the stash, I ain't your region, you whack
Step away don't get clapped, your team is nothing but trash
Bitch I shit on you, and I don't even try
Fuck he goin pride nigga I ain't never lie
Prolly once or twice, cause my brother got locked
I ain't finna to say shit, specially not to the cops
You twisted little bitch, keep it loyal and rich
Hella gold on my neck, feeling royal and shit
Been working like a slave, so I spoil my wrist
Fuck is up with you kids, tryina know all my bizz

[Bridge:]
Better watch your mouth, dumb ho ah
Makin my money and staying low ah
Better watch your mouth, dumb ho ah
Makin my money and staying low ah

[Hook:]
All the time I hustle cause that's what I do
Hold it down for mine and the goons in my crew
I ain't no murderer, but I'm a do what the fuck I gotta do
Nigga I ain't no murderer, but I'm a do what the fuck I gotta do

[Verse 2:]
Give me a break from all the drama and shit
Always getting paid, bitch gossip bout this
Used to try to find a way, just to make me these cents
Since the grind's paying off, bitches hate me since
Bitch I'm the generation's hip hop voice
Love me or be jealous, homie it's your choice
But see me, when you see me, homie fuck that noise
Ever since I made it big, all the homies employed
Don't start with me bitch, you're losing yourself
I got plans, you ain't even got a clue bout yourself
It's all good, young thug, I'm just showing you ropes
Check your beliefs, little bitch don't choke

[Bridge:]
Better watch your mouth, dumb ho ah
Makin my money and staying low ah
Better watch your mouth, dumb ho ah
Makin my money and staying low ah

[Hook:]
All the time I hustle cause that's what I do
Hold it down for mine and the goons in my crew
I ain't no murderer, but I'm a do what the fuck I gotta do
Nigga I ain't no murderer, but I'm a do what the fuck I gotta do
