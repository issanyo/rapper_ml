[Hook: Rayven Justice]
I got a thing for you, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I got a thing for you, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I got a thing for you, I got a thing for you
I got a thing for you, I-I got, I-I got a, I got a, I got a thing

[Verse 1: Rayven Justice]
Baby you the baddest
Every nigga wishing they can have it
You say you lookin' for a real nigga
Not a lame nigga, nothing average
I feel you babe, looking in the right place
So come fuck with me, let me take you 'round the bay
Oh no, no, I got a thing for you
But can a nigga say, I wanna do some things to you
Got all night and day

[Hook: Rayven Justice]
I got a thing for you, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I got a thing for you, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I got a thing for you, I got a thing for you
I got a thing for you, I-I got, I-I got a, I got a, I got a thing

[Verse 2: Honey Cocaine]
I got a little more than a thing for ya
I might wear nothin' but a string for ya
And everybody know I ain't a fling to ya
I'm at the studio and then I'm 'bout to swing to ya
We-we can smoke up, order pizza
I ain't roll but he let me use his visa
Dick game turned his ex to a creeper
And any nigga know he keep it on him like a beeper
Down for whatever, long as we together
Pounds in the feathers, cheating on me? Never
Put him on my header
I-i got a ring for ya
Might even sing for ya

[Hook: Rayven Justice]
I got a thing for you, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I got a thing for you, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I got a thing for you, I got a thing for you
I got a thing for you, I-I got, I-I got a, I got a, I got a thing

[Bridge: Rayven Justice]
I like how you grabbing on me
I like how you throw it on me
I like how you kissing on me
You making me so horny
Girl I need that
Yeah I really mean that
You know I'm finna kill that
Fuck all the chit-chat
Come over for a night cap
But don't forget your night bag
I got a thing for you
But can a nigga say, I wanna do some things to you
Got all night and day

[Hook: Rayven Justice]
I got a thing for you, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I got a thing for you, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I got a thing for you, I got a thing for you
I got a thing for you, I-I got, I-I got a, I got a, I got a thing
