[Verse 1]

I was blessed with the skills to make a bitch feel like shit
I got the traits of queen,so bitch it is what it is
Tell my enemies remember me ,as long as they live
Cause I come through, I fuck shit up
Then I take yo' bitch
Uhh, cut the lights out , ain't fuckin' with a lame bitch right now
Uhh, been about it from the 6th grade
First time I ever hit a bitch face, first
Excuse my attitude, still a goon gone do what she have to do
All you hoes like snacks, fuck a diet though
I eat these rap bitches stay quiet ho

[Hook]

Off with yo' head then show me the bread
I'm laughin' at you hoes, but I hustle instead
Off with yo' head then show me the bread
I'm laughin' at you hoes, but I hustle instead
Can't help It If I'm icey bitch
I'm just an icey bitch
Can't help It If I'm icey bitch
I'm just an icey bitch
Can't help It If I'm icey bitch
I'm just an icey bitch
Can't help It If I'm icey bitch
I'm just an icey bitch

[Verse 2]

If you weak ass bitch don't yell for me
Shout out all my homies from the LBC, yea
From youngins to OG's, my arrest gold, you can tell it's me
What up with it, competin' with a goon, good luck with it
A shit load of dumb hoes copyin' me
So a better yet, a motherfucka' cut from it
I'm nice with the flows, I swear to God it's some fire
Probably sign all you rappers by the time I retire
From the streets, better show me cheese
Bitch show yo' weave
So original and G, follow my lead
You'll be samplin' me

[Hook]
