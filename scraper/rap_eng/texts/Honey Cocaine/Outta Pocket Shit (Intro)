There's gon be people who love you
There's gon be people who hate you
There's gonna be Mothafuckas that respect you
And mothafuckas that don't

And at the end of the day
There's nothing you can do about it
You feel me?
Like there's nothing you can do about it

Now days this is like
People are dying over hate
Like sometimes when you push someone to the edge
They might do something
You know what I mean?
They might do something outta pocket
Something you don't expect from that mothafucka

Because we're all human at the end of the day
I don't really react to hate
And why not? And it hits me in my heart
But I just realized that this is how this world is
And this is what it's gonna be forever
And if I do something outta pocket you know that's just
That's just me reacting as a human
