[Verse 1]
Running away, I'm running away
Cupid ain't shit throw the gun in my way
Bullets spit in my face, tears fall from the sky
What a beautiful frown it has kept me alive
Seeking for an answer but I feel like I'm far
Runaway bitch with a reblious heart
What a dangerous game, hope you walk out now
Cause love is a bitch and she talks out loud
Wish I was the type to maybe open my heart
Said it from the start, shit it's cold and it's dark
So what? Lust me or lust me not
Fuck trust and feelings, I trust my Glock

[Hook]
Guns to the sky, runaway brides
I thought I told you thugs don't cry
I'm on my queen shit
I'm on my queen shit
(x2)

[Verse 2]
Hitting the ground, I be hitting the ground
Escaping what's left, I ain't trying to be found
Say it's my fault for dishonoring love
But tell me I've been smart all along as a thug
I ain't taking a chance, you get the piece from me
Love rips you apart and it's so easy to see
So damn young and naive, fuck looking for me
Cause thugs don't cry, can't be waiting for me
Loyal to rap, I'm only loyal to rap
Sending me love, I'm just gonna send her ass back
So tell me? lust me or lust me not
Fuck trust and feelings, I trust my Glock

[Hook]
