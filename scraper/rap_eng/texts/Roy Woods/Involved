[Intro]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-aah-ah-yeah

[Verse 1]
I walked into the club
Popped a few bottles with my bruhs
It ain't ever less, no fuck niggas rolling with me
Can't trust some niggas in the beez
Acting all nice in ya face, but it's what you don't see
The snake, that's never in me
Backwoods rolled right before I touch road
And already shawty got money like she's an Italian
And..

[Refrain]
I just brought a nice lil' thing for my momma not a hoe
Pull up in a Range all black she love my coat
Cold as ice-cream when you come into the North
She screams for me cause the buddy is tearing up her walls

[Hook]
And when she wants the booty call
She gon' send an Uber to my place
I got kush smoke a lot girl
Do you wanna get involved with me
And when she wants the booty call
She gon' send an Uber to my place
I got kush smoke a lot girl
Do you wanna get involved with me
Do you wanna get involved with me
Do you wanna get involved with me

[Verse 2]
I got a lot of big things to do
My lil' shorty on to me
I need to make sure of the reasons she has wants for me
If you gettin' down with me shorty show some loyalty
I don't really need these problems anymore (nah, nah)
Been going through this too long now (and ma-a)
Too long for her now
Who else gon' treat you like a queen? You don't know
No more Presto
She stop at the Esso
When you want a re-fill, you know where the cup
Hit her with a right stroke, hit her with a left stroke
And make your pum-pum cum cum all over me

[Hook]
And when she wants the booty call
She gon' send an Uber to my place
I got kush smoke a lot girl
Do you wanna get involved with me
And when she wants the booty call
She gon' send an Uber to my place
I got kush smoke a lot girl
Do you wanna get involved with me
Do you wanna get involved with me
Do you wanna get involved with me

[Outro]
I just brought a nice lil' thing for my momma not a, m-momma not a
C-c-c-c-cold as ice-cream when you come into the
I just brought a nice lil' thing for my momma not a hoe
Pull up in a Range all black she love my coat
Cold as ice-cream when you come into the North
She screams for me cause the buddy is tearing up her walls
Brought a nice lil' thing for my momma not a hoe
Pull up in a Range all black she love my coat
Cold as ice-cream when you come into the North
She screams for me cause the buddy is tearing up her walls
Tearing up her walls
Come into the North
