[Chorus]
I got my mind on my money nigga from Monday to Monday
Thinking about my money go to Church on a Sunday
Popped an ecstacy pill, xans when I wanna
You can't talk to me about that good or bad karma
I got my mind on my money nigga from Monday to Monday
Thinking about my money go to Church on a Sunday
Popped an ecstacy pill, xans when I wanna
You can't talk to me about that good or bad karma

[Bridge]
Yeah
Play
With me
Off ecstasy

[Verse 1]
Money fly you out when you in Georgia (in Georgia)
I make sure shorty feel important (feel important)
Balmains while she's going shopping
Marilyn keeps her on auto pilot (auto, auto, auto)
Catch me with thugs
Ride around with them birds
Drugs make her slow
Can't feel her toes
Gang shit on Tour
Ohh she love me (hey)
All my diamonds drownin' (hey)
Bitch touch Molly (oh)
Girl what you planning (oh, oh)
I feel like Aladin (yeah)
I just found my Jasmine (my Jasmine)
Ohh she crazy
I love her crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not new here
So, donâ€™t disrespect me for some new mans styll
And I don't know who cares, but I
Don't, don't really care 'bout you
Don't, don't wanna hear 'bout you
Don't, don't really care 'bout you
Don't, don't wanna hear 'bout you
Wanna hear bout you
Don't, don't really care 'bout you
Don't, don't wanna hear 'bout you
Don't, don't
Don't, don't

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Gyal dem go shopping
Yorkdale with squaddy (okay)
Saks fifth better spend a bag if you walk in
Ass look melodic, in Toronto with exotic
Like these bitches are from Europe
My girl look like Katie Couric
She got tattoos on her arm
She sings like Adele (okay)
Narcotics for fun (ooh)
Liquors for the pain (yeah)
Don't believe in love (no, no)
Marriage ain't her thing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Face, out my face bitch
Am I looking out your way now
Cyatties out the base
But I'm looking for my main girl (main)
I could barely think
I have way too much to say now
Can we take a trip
And fly out to Costa Rica
They wanna be us

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not new here
So don't disrespect me for some new mans styll
And I don't know who cares, but I
Don't, don't really care 'bout you
Don't, don't wanna hear 'bout you

Don't, don't wanna hear 'bout you
Wanna hear bout you
Don't ,don't really care 'bout you
Don't, don't wanna hear 'bout you
Don't, don't
Don't, don't
