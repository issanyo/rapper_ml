[Verse 1]
If I lost you here would it matter now?
If I fucked her good would it matter now?
If I stayed with you would it matter now?
Cause girl I fuck with you and I can't stand it
Don't waste my time if you held me down long
I'd rather you push me away, push me away
I'd rather you push me away, push me away
Oh no , it's far from obvious
Can we change what's wrong with us?
Oh now I know you're not good for me
Guess it's time for me to leave
Say goodbye cause finally

[Hook]
You can't push me away, push me away
I'd rather you push me away, push me away
Oh no, push me away, push me away
I'd rather you push me away, push me away
Oh no, push me away, push me away
I'd rather you push me away, push me away
I'd rather you push me away, push me away
Oh no, push me away, push me away
I'd rather you push me away

[Verse 2]
No more girl, I can't take love
Way too much of the same stuff
Seen my look in the mirror, had enough
Need some peace in my life
I do not want you no more
Understand I cannot have you no more, no no
Have this time girl I need space
It ain't love, you got it made
I was thinking about you the other day
Now I can't you stand you enough now
Are we gonna go through this everyday?
Doesn't matter how much you want me now
You're putting me through too much pain
You got a stress that I don't need, no
You put me through way too much pain
Love you girl but it meant nothing
You're runnin' on stress, girl I don't need it
You're putting me through way too much love
Why you coming here, acting like we solved it?
Love you but it don't mean nothing
Oh now I know, you're not good for me
Guess it's time for me to leave
Say goodbye cause finally, oh

[Hook]
You can't push me away, push me away
I'd rather you push me away, push me away
Oh no, push me away, push me away
I'd rather you push me away, push me away
Oh no, push me away, push me away
I'd rather you push me away
I'd rather you push me away, push me away
Oh no, push me away, push me away
I'd rather you push me, push me away
