[Intro]
1:44AM, almost done

[Verse]
I could pop another pill tonight
Even though I don't really want one
The Xanax got me on a flight
I don't need much
I just want to get a buzz from the blunt
Sipping beverage here on my own
I just want to wyle with you
Shawty outside getting high while I do that shit on my own
Know I'm top 5 for the week and the night
On the billboards dressing her out on her own
I drink alcohol in the fall and the summer
Or wintertime cold, my beer ice cold

[Hook]
She ain't outdoors and her heart just cold as is
As is, as is, as is
She ain't outdoors and her heart just cold as is
As is, as is, as is
She ain't outdoors and her heart just cold as is
As is, as is, as is
She ain't outdoors and her heart just cold as is
As is, as is, as is

[Refrain]
Oh
Yeah
Oh
Yeah

[Bridge]
And her heart just cold as is
As is, as is, as is
I don't want much, I just need your love
As is, as is, as is

[Outro]
Baby, I'm trying to win this back
I needed love
But now you're gone
As is, as is
Baby I'm falling
Away from you
Body go bad
She might not even blow if she goes back home
But I know
Ooh, that she needs sex
Oh ooh la, oh ha
Oh ooh la, oh ha
Oh hey
Oh-way ooh-woah
