[Chorus: Roy Woods]
No need to pretend, she got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends, yeah

[Verse: Maybel Montez]
You have two lovers, I'm 0 for 26 
They love each other, she don't want me to quit 
Keep playing my role, I can't break character 
Girl you know I'm the actor 
Girl I won't let go, I'm brave in every scenic yeah 
Here you are my fantasy
This is what they handed me 
Me and you were meant to be 
You're the one God sent to me 
I just need you on my side 
Baby are you down to ride ?
Girl without you I might die 
Girl I think its best we try

[Bridge: Maybel Montez]
All your friends love you 
Girl you its true 
They'll stick up for you 
And I have the proof 
I will do that too 
Girl I made my move 
Now its up to you

[Chorus: Roy Woods]
No need to pretend, she got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends
She got a little bit of drama with her friends, yeah
