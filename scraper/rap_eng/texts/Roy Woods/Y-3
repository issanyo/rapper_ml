[Intro: TRIPSIXX]
Keep it recording, UTU!

[Verse 1: TRIPSIXX & Roy Wood$]
Hold up, press pause
Who ain't got flaws? Who ain't got issues?
They wish to resolve but couldn't
Sometimes the shooter ain't got bullets
Hold up, but I'm all for this
And I'm really trynna fuck her, but I probably shouldn't
She wanna get with a nigga that ain't from the city
I mean, wow!
My life was never like this before
Get this chick's pussy down to the floor
I wanna hit it up some more, let's go
Then you gotta go back home in the morning
That's just how it is, how it goes
Why are these niggas moving so slow? Hey
No wonder I stay at home on my dolo in the cut, what's good?
Smoked a few blunts down, that's how it comes, how it go

[Hook: TRIPSIXX]
That bitch ain't love you, she love everybody
Tell her friends to come
I know that bitch, I know she's down for ménage
Pardon my manners, pardon my manners, shawty
I was on molly before I showed up to the party
Sippin' out the double cup, ay, my drink is so muddy
Bitch you need to get up out of my section if she ain't down for the fucking

[Bridge: TRIPSIXX]
I run them bands up, but let that money blow-blow-blow-blow
I spend a check, man, these kicks is Yohji Yamamoto-to-to-to
All of my niggas they're ready, let it go-go-go-go
She gon' drop her panties to the floor-floor-floor

[Verse 2: Roy Wood$]
Why'd I get it? Shawty didn't know I'm in it
I'm with her best friend, but I wanna fuck it all
My niggas TT and Hitman, I ride with some shooters
When I come through, y'all know the dude
I'm pulling up all black in an Uber
Soon as I come through the party, bad bitches all out on the molly
It's all blessed when I come to my hood
Always come to my hood with the Backwoods, yea gun talk
The meds gon' talk, bad bitch here to fuck
Always stay good in the stu', get crunk
Damn, I'm so turned off the motherfucking Henny
On the same night that your girl wanna please me
Man, that's easy
When I get it in the back she act sleazy
Six in the morning, seven in the morning
Can't take dick but you're moaning

[Hook: TRIPSIXX]
That bitch ain't love you, she love everybody
Tell her friends to come
I know that bitch, I know she's down for ménage
Pardon my manners, pardon my manners shawty
I was on molly before I showed up to the party
Sippin' out the double cup, ay, my drink is so muddy
Bitch get out my section if she ain't down for the fucking

[Bridge: TRIPSIXX]
I run them bands up, but let that money blow-blow-blow
I spend a check, man, these kicks is Yohji Yamamoto-to-to
All of my niggas they're ready, let it go-go-go
She gon' drop her panties to the floor-floor-floor

[Outro: Roy Wood$ & TRIPSIXX]
You ain't gotta ask cause they already know
You ain't gotta ask cause they already know
You ain't gotta ask cause they already know
You ain't gotta ask cause they already know
Word on the road, word on the road
You ain't gotta ask cause they already know it
You ain't gotta ask cause they already know it
It's a UTU ting, OVO ting, UTU ting
