[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Roy Woods]
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
UTU FÃ¨rina

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Back it up for me, back it, back it up for me
Back it up for me, back it, back it up for me
Back it up for me, back it, back it up for me
Back it up for me, back it, back it up for me
You don't get to see my face, just drop it down
You don't get to see my face, just pop it down, pop it down
Oh-woah, woah-woah
Oh-woah, woah-woah

[Verse 1: Roy Woods]
Girl I'm wavy
I don't call you but you wanna see me daily
I can't talk to you 'cause I know all your ways
Fresh start if you're really down to wait
I ain't lettin' go of nothin' that you say
Bad things running through my head I don't know 'bout
We gon' turn up with PARTYNEXTDOOR
So much liquor, I had a gun through on forearm
Find out her friends can't leave me alone
You want me 'cause I'm in the limelight
Act like you don't care about my time
Actions don't faze me, you be on your fake shit
You can't be my lady

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Back it up for me, back it, back it up for me
Back it up for me, back it, back it up for me
Back it up for me, back it, back it up for me
Back it up for me, back it, back it up for me
You don't get to see my face, just drop it down
You don't get to see my face, just pop it down, pop it down
Oh-woah, woah-woah
Oh-woah, woah-woah

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Bigger house just 'cause I wanna throw a bigger party
Twist it up then pour a cup, I might dive in some molly
Girl I only come here when I'm feeling melancholy
At least when I come here I'm spending big money
I'm on go, I don't know
How to take it slow
Specially when I'm on the road, road, mm, hee
I know that you like your Hennessy
I see that you stuntin' on your enemies
Dancing in your brand new Giuseppes, ah baby please yeah
Bend down to your knees yeah
Baby let me see yeah
Don't make me beg and say please, yeah

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Ooh, back it up for me, back it, back it up for me
Back it up for me, back it, back it up for me
Back it up for me, back it, back it up for me
Back it up for me, back it, back it up for me
You don't get to see my face, just drop it down
You don't get to see my face, just pop it down, pop it down
Oh-woah, woah-woah
Oh-woah, woah-woah

[Verse 3: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Flip on, flip down, bounce down
Uh oh, you the baddest in the town
Sauga City, Brampton, pow pow
West side, west side yee
Them diamonds on my wrist, woo
Big diamond come out the old
Super shining in the city
Super shining, watch me glow
Baby girl I know you know
Baby girl it's a light show
When I pull up, when I pull up, I just wanna see you drop it, down
Skrt it, skrt it, day
Ah, want to see you naked
Want to see you make it
Throwin' hundreds at you babe

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Back it up for me, back it, back it up for me
Back it up for me, back it, back it up for me
Back it up for me, back it, back it up for me
Back it up for me, back it, back it up for me
You don't get to see my face, just drop it down
You don't get to see my face, just pop it down, pop it down
Oh-woah, woah-woah
Oh-woah, woah-woah
