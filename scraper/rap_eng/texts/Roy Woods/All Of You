[Intro]
Come on, girl..
You were my everything, all of you, when I sing
I feel your lips again, I feel your pussy wet
You were my special girl, all of you on my chest
Hide the hickey on your neck or else mom will be upset

[Hook]
All of you, were mine
All of you, were fine
All of you were dimes, I miss you all but I, but I, but I

[Verse]
I've been getting faded in the city, (hey)
Marilyn Monroe in my body keep me up 'til the mornin'
Itâ€™s 3:33 in the 6 on our way to the party
After clubbing
I ain't ever yawning
Girl you know I'm in the zone now
I don't wanna leave it to beat it up nah
Just  to go in my dreams, don't talk to my mom nah
She's just gone down, she broke down
Oh hey, like she broke down, I know it, oh yeah
Her heart melt down when I got into this stuff
Boy in the city with a no-way sign
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Girl I can take you down
I'm into light skin girls and I like Chris Brown
Ima do it all yeah
Smoking marijuana girl (oh yeah, oh yeah)
You know, you know, you know
I got you on the low if you want some more of me (oh yeah)
But you don't know about me, never
And the shit that I went through

[Hook]
All of you, were mine
All of you, were fine
All of you were dimes, I miss you all but I, but I, but I..
