[Verse 1]
Tell your friends to nize their talk
I say less, can't say much
Tell me if I'm in the wrong
So that I can fix up
I don't mind when you're on drugs
But sometimes you take too much
You can't even clean your mess
But you still brush me off
Like it's nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Even though you got nothing
Nothing
Nothing

[Chorus]
Can't treat a real one like they're nothing
Tell me why should we argue
Over nothing when I need you like glasses
Like glasses
Like glasses
When I need you like glasses
Like glasses
Can't see without you can't be without you like glasses
Like glasses
Like glasses
Like glasses
Can't see without you can't be without you
I need you like glasses

[Verse 2]
You get mad at me, although you're wrong
I love it when you strip to my songs (all night long)
I can watch your body all night long
I need you close, don't go too far
Back it up and then face me
White gyal but dance like Jamaican
I already got temptations
To get you in my room naked
Touch me, lick me
I lick you since you teased me
Trust me I know it's easy
Wanna cuff me then leave me like it's nothing
Nothing
Nothing
When we both know I'm more than nothing

[Chorus]
Can't treat a real one like they're nothing
Tell me why should we argue
Over nothing when I need you like glasses
Like glasses
Like glasses
When I need you like glasses
Like glasses
Can't see without you can't be without you like
Like glasses
Like glasses
Like glasses
Like glasses
Can't see without you can't be without you
I need you like glasses

[Outro]
Say Less
Say Less
Say Less
Say Less
