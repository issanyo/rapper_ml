[Verse 1]
It's been good, but I gotta pack it up
From your hood, I'm gonna travel far
I know you're stuck and probably think that I don't care
I did too much as you did too, so we're both fair
I can't get enough from you, so I need to be alone
Time to let my pain, go, go, go, go, go
I don't wanna start fiending for your love
Just let me go now and I'll be back soon

[Pre-Hook]
You don't have to tell me that you don't care
I know you do
Don't tell me it's just a girl ting
Oh, ahlie
You think that I love her, but I don't want her
Anyway

[Hook]
She knows about me and I know about her
She knows about me and I know about her
She knows about me and I know about her
She knows about me and I know about her
She knows about me and I know about her
She knows about me and I know about her
She knows about me and I know about her
She knows about me and I know about her

[Verse 2]
Knows my style, can we go out?
She's not that foreign but she's still bad
She don't like problems, not with her man
I'm so damn sorry, I am not like...
That man you wanted, I am not that
I'm by my lonely when she's gone back to home
I swear I still don't like myself at all
But right now, right now, I don't wanna talk

[Pre-Hook]
You don't have to tell me that you don't care
I know you do
Don't tell me it's just a girl ting
Oh, ahlie
You think that I love her, but I don't want her
Anyway...

[Hook]
She knows about me and I know about her
She knows about me and I know about her
She knows about me and I know about her
She knows about me and I know about her
She knows about me and I know about her
She knows about me and I know about her
She knows about me and I know about her
She knows about me and I know about her

[Outro]
She knows about me, me, me
Me, me, yeah, knows about me
Knows about me
She knows about me
She knows about me
I want her love
For a while
Let's get it on
(Let's get it on)
Let's drive through baby, (skrr, skrr)
Let's get it on
Oh, smokin outside
And you know it all
Hey, why you walkin' like you know it all
(Why you walkin' like you know it all)
Shawty I got feelings, I show it all
(I got feelings, I show it all)
Getting down, getting down with you
(Getting down)
Shawty to bad for you
(Bad for you)
A song that I'm writing on my own
(Writing on my own)
Hope I'm not putting anything too personal
Fuck
And now you know
And now you know
Let's get it on
She's stealing my  heart
Stealing in my heart like I never had love
Had love baby
