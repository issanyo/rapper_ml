[Intro]
Oh, what are you on?
When you get with us
What should I know?
When you get up

[Chorus]
Oh, what are you on?
What are you on?
What are you on?
What are you
Oh girl, what are you on?
What are you on?
What are you on?
What are you
Oh girl, what are you on?
What are you on?
What are you on?
What are you
Oh girl, what are you on?
What are you on?
What are you on?
What are you
Oh girl, what are you

[Verse 1]
Smoke blunts, rather pop one to get off
VVS make your lady dance from afar
Roll it fast 'cause marijuana is my cologne
Lil' baby come and smoke with me
He ain't no friend of me
Bad bitches still the only girls that can be friends with me
Fuck you good, pass you to the left, to your enemy (to your enemy)
What you want? Money and Patr√≥n
Before you get it free I'd rather tell you what to tell
They know this isn't me but shit happens when you get older
Niggas didn't think I'd make it far when I told them
Out there in the woods lookin' for peace out with my soldiers
Everybody lookin' at me like I can help them

[Refrain]
I know what I meant for my nigga, I'm respected
My life is for my people, they been movin' reckless
Trap, job, plat' niggas workin' restless
All you want is my money but do you respect it?
I know what I meant for my nigga, I'm respected
My life is for my people, they been movin' reckless
Trap, job, plat' niggas workin' restless
All you want is my money but do you respect it?

[Chorus]
What are you on? (coke, xans, molly, grams)
What are you on?
What are you on?
What are you
Oh girl, what are you on? (coke, xans, molly, grams)
What are you on?
What are you on?
What are you
Oh girl, what are you on? (coke, xans, molly, grams)
What are you on?
What are you on?
What are you
Oh girl, what are you on? (coke, xans, molly, grams)
What are you on?
What are you on?
What are you
Oh girl, what are you

[Verse 2]
I worked for everything I got
You don't know how to treat a boss
My thick girl stay with thunder thighs
Lightning bolt didn't kill her this time
I know she like my style
Ain't no asking why, two cups at a time
'Bout to multiply
I have been on more than one, two, three, four, five
Get high

[Refrain]
I know what I meant for my nigga, I'm respected
My life is for my people, they been movin' reckless
Trap, job, plat' niggas workin' restless
All you want is my money but do you respect it?
I know what I meant for my nigga, I'm respected
My life is for my people, they been movin' reckless
Trap, job, plat' niggas workin' restless
All you want is my money but do you respect it?

[Outro]
Coke, xans, molly, grams
Coke, xans, molly, grams
Coke, xans, molly
What you want?
Coke, xans, molly, grams
Coke, xans, molly
What you want?
Coke, xans, molly, grams
Coke, xans
