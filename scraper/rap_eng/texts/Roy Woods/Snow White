Yo blast that shit Maxx
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, yeah, ay
Ooh, ay, ooh, ay

[Verse 1]
I'm tellin' lil' mama she my type (she my type, type)
Girl you look so sexy wearin' my clothes
Lovin' when you rub me in the night long (in the night)
Fuckin' me she turns me to a psycho, woah
Copy, are you listenin' girl do you copy? (copy)
Sloppy (stop, stop) want you on your knees want that toppy
Follow me, shawty buyin' Gucci and new Balmain (Gucci, Gucci gang)
Shawty know some niggas you embody
I got niggas too, I know my ting (I know my ting)

[Pre-Chorus]
You gon' go broke 'cause you done spend your limits (spend your limits)
No investments just necklaces and watches
But I move like a ninja on that Kawasaki (skrrt, skrrt)
Go fast, life on, road (road)
Brings more white (white) snow (snow)
Tings on my (my) phone (phone), love that white (white) snow (snow)
Giggity on my floor (giggity on my)
She want it and I, know (she want and I)
Snow white drippin' down from her nose (from her nose)
Don't get blood on my clothes (hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus]
Snow, snow, white
White, that snow, snow
Snow, that snow, white
Snow,  that snow, snow
Snow, that snow, white
Snow, that snow, snow
Snow, that snow, white
Snow, that snow, snow, woah

[Verse 2]
I buy her whatever she wants
But I won't take her to the store
That don't mean I can't snowboard
Too much fuckin' we can't get bored
Hennessy no Bombay
She used to rock Jordans all day (all 12's yeah)
I got niggas from the lake (huh, from the lake)
Scratchin' down the pie, see the flake (huh, flake, flake)
Easy oven bitch I got cake
Callin' plays since Madden 08
Drinkin' off but I walk straight
Michael Jackson Gucci shoes blind your face
I roll with some niggas that gon' shoot
Pussy boi this ain't no photoshoot
I got bitches that like bitches too (like the bitches too)
I got bitches that can line you too (like line you up, yeah)
How you tryna lie I know the truth
Different ways a nigga seein' you
Got you in the corner you can't move
Got you in the corner you can't move

[Pre-Chorus]
You gon' go broke 'cause you done spend your limits (spend your limits)
No investments just necklaces and watches
But I move like a ninja on that Kawasaki (skrrt, skrrt)
Go fast, life on, road (road)
Brings more white (white) snow (snow)
Tings on my (my) phone (phone), love that white (white) snow (snow)
Giggity on my floor (giggity on my)
She want and I, know
Snow white drippin' down from her nose (snow white)
Don't get blood on my clothes

[Chorus]
Snow, snow, white (white)
White, that snow, snow
Snow, that snow, white
Snow, that snow, snow
Snow, that snow, white
Snow, that snow, snow
Snow, that snow, white
Snow, that snow, snow, woah
