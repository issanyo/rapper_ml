[Verse 1]
647, they know 'bout us
905 niggas on the block
Still sipping Crown Royal Apple
Michael Jackson, smoking on the blunt
Shawty's all down, all 'bout it
Holding my weed in her purse
I'm in the 6, I put in work
Imagine the streets, they put in work
I was in the 6, putting in work
[?]
Do I have a gift, do I have a curse?
And do I have to ride around here?
You fall in love with a star
Just do my [?] when I walk in
Just get it down with me Lord
I'm Tom Brady in the pocket

[Hook]
Cause my weed's so strong when I pass it
My plug hitting lanes when I call
458 on the dash
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Cause my weed's so strong when I pass it
My plug hitting lanes when I call
458 on the dash
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit

[Verse 2]
Shawty got down with a nigga like this
Cause, ay, I been on a roll
Lately I've been ducking down this little  brown ting
Said she miss me for so long
Before they got down, it was never like this
Not in the city, that's how I do it
All the baddie’s still fine, and the bodies all thick
I don't know what I'mma do with 'em
She know that she bad but she hit it on the low
You let 'em mistreat you
Who would’ve known that me and her get along
Now you know what the beast do
I'mma tell you one time, in my room, take off your thong
Now that you’ve reached the six side
She ain't tryna bust a dab, not try me on the low
She keep calling me over

[Hook]
Cause my weed's so strong when I pass it
My plug hitting lanes when I call
458 on the dash
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Cause my weed's so strong when I pass it
My plug hitting lanes when I call
458 on the dash
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit
Ain't no time to dap on the fuck shit

[Bridge]
I been tryna come through with a little baddy and she down
She ain't tryna come through with a little singing ass nigga
I been tryna come through with a little baddy and she down
She ain't tryna come through with a little singing ass nigga
I been tryna come through with a little body and she down
She ain't tryna come through with a little singing ass nigga
I been tryna come through with a little baddy and she down
She ain't tryna come through with a little singing ass nigga
I been tryna come through with a little baddy and she down
She ain't tryna come through with a little singing ass nigga
I been tryna come through with a little baddy and she down
She ain't tryna come through with a little singing ass nigga

[Outro]

My nigga Kurbs is in the cut
Sunny Diamonds in the cut
