[Chorus]
Heard you got a lot to say
Maybe you should say less
You ain't gotta tell no lie
Maybe you can confess
100 Fahrenheit in my room
Maybe you should undress
No talk say less

[Post-Chorus]
(Say less, say less, say less, say less, say less)
(Say less, say less, say less, say less, say less)
(Say less, say less, say less, say less, say less, say less)
(Say less, say less, say less, say less, say less, say less, say less)

[Verse]
(I be, I be, I be)
Falling in love with women, I don't know what I see in 'em
More times I be lonely so I don't know what I be feeling
Gotta do more, say less, how I'm living
(B-Town, 6 side shit, know what I'm talking about)
Don't talk no more cause I know what you doing
Got mans to the side but you say you're alone
Money on sight now your eyes on gold
Can't take your ass shopping, tripping on Jimmy Choo's
Yeah, said you gonna stay over for the night, but you got me waiting
Barely said a thing, got me here alone without conversation, yeah
I feel beside myself, I understand me
Had to re-align myself or else I would have lost me (would've lost me, would've lost me, woah no)
But I found myself, in my youth
Time well spent in the booth, oh
Yeah

[Chorus]
Heard you got a lot to say
Maybe you should say less
You ain't gotta tell no lie
Maybe you can confess
100 Fahrenheit in my room
Maybe you should undress
No talk say less

[Post-Chorus]
(Say less, say less, say less, say less, say less)
(Say less, say less, say less, say less, say less)
Less, yeah (Say less, say less, say less, say less, say less, say less)
Baby girl, I (Say less, say less, say less, say less, say less, say less, say less)
