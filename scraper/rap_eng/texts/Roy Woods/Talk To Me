[Chorus]
Why won't you talk to me? (Won't you)
Why won't you talk to me?
Why won't you talk to me?
Get those problems out of your head
Take a second girl, talk to me
Cause I know you got some shit that you haven't said yeah
Why won't you talk to me?
Get those problems out of your head
Take a second girl, talk to me
Cause I know you got some shit that you haven't said yeah
Why won't you talk to me?

[Verse 1]
Get them niggas up outta your mind, you're mine
Don't change for me girl, change for yourself
Cause you're wasting your time
I got you way on the low bout you and your lines
Girl you know you're fine
All I wanna throw away is designers
Talk to a nigga get further
When it comes to this drug love, I'm the father
Number 1 Randy Moss, [?] Chris Carter
Yeah I brought it up, now it's possible
So talkative but not around your boy
It's been obvious, you don't wanna look
I been honest though
This gonna be the same song that you thought was dope
Till you heard some dope
When you need more, just let it all come for ya
Same young nigga that you used to ignore
Shit I ain't blow up and you already callin' my number
But I'm working in the future
Don't want me, you don't talk to me
Don't watch me, you don't talk to me
Cause you wanna talk, that's all you need

[Chorus]
Why won't you talk to me?
Get those problems out of your head
Take a second girl, talk to me
Cause I know you got some shit you ain't say
Why won't you talk to me?
Get those problems out of your head
Take a second girl, talk to me
Cause I know you got some shit you ain't say
Why won't you talk to me?
Get those problems out of your head
Take a second girl, talk to me
Cause I know you got some shit you ain't say
Why won't you talk to me?
Get those problems out of your head
Take a second girl, talk to me
Cause I know you got some shit you ain't say, yeah

[Verse 2]
Loves gonna come my way again
The bus catch gotta take the train again
I missed you but you keep complaining and
Fighting without giving me a reason
Xans and Coke is what you believe in
Like a Christian believes in Jesus
No lie, girl, speaking real shit
Wanna wake up, but she can't give a reason
Time's going downtown now
You's a bad bitch, only cause of my sound
I roll with my niggas that's it though
You got their number, I bet though
You both knew what she wanted from the get go
She a good girl but her friends from the ghettos
Been hard for her shorty cause she can't let go
So I let go, just tell me, what's on your mind?
Cause for some reason, I keep on grindin'
And I don't need this, I see it right now
Cause you let up out your life

[Chorus]
Why won't you talk to me?
Get those problems out of your head
Take a second girl, talk to me
Cause I know you got some shit you ain't say
Why won't you talk to me?
Get those problems out of your head
Take a second girl, talk to me
Cause I know you got some shit you ain't say
Why won't you talk to me?
Get those problems out of your head
Take a second girl, talk to me
Cause I know you got some shit you ain't say
Why won't you talk to me?
Get those problems out of your head
Take a second girl, talk to me
Cause I know you got some shit you ain't say, yeah
