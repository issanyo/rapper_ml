[Verse]
It's not the same anymore
Look me in my eyes and say you know me
I've been getting this on my own
Back then I drop a track and they ignore me
I'm on her snapchat story
The one I make love to is gorgeous
But I've been getting laid
I'm getting frustrated

[Pre-Hook]
Where was they at way back
Couches where I slept at
Never am I gon' go back
For years I had my own back
I'm still looking for some closure
They can find me on my own cause
I know I said I'd never stay sober
Maybe that's why I can't remember past September

[Hook]
They don't want to talk now
Actin' like they've done some'
Now they want to switch on me
Now they want to switch on me
I just copped my home
Now that I have grown
They all want to switch on me
They all want to switch on me
They don't want to talk now
Actin' like they don' something
Now they wanna switch on me
Now they wanna switch on me
I just got my home
Now that I have grown
They all want to switch on me
They all want to switch on me

[Pre-Hook]
Where was they at way back
Couches where I slept at
Never am I gon' go back
For years I had my own back
I'm still looking for closure
They can find me on my own cause
I know I said I'd never stay sober
Maybe that's why I can't remember

[Hook]
They don't want to talk now
Actin' like they done some'
Now they want to switch on me
Now they want to switch on me
I just copped my home
Now that I have grown
They all want to switch on me
They all want to switch on me
They don't want to talk now
Actin' like they don' something
Now they wanna switch on me
Now they wanna switch on me
I just got my home
Now that I have grown
They all want to switch on me
They all want to switch on me

[Outro]
Yeah
Oh yeah
