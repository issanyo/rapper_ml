[Chorus: Sha Hustle]
I'm from that city where they chop you up
City where they put you down
City where you [?]
City where you can't walk 'round
City where we do that shit
City where we make that noise
City where we pop a bottle
City full of city bitches

City full of city bitches
We run this shit and you already know that

[Verse 1: Roy Wood$]
Catch you on yo' side of town
I'ma put my city on
Get a call, they ridin' now
I don't waste my time on niggas
Pussy niggas run they mouth
All my day ones got a clip to shut yo' lip and take you out
Nigga I been grindin',  try to make it for my city
[?] sendin' shots to all my niggas shootin' with me
They all 'bout it now
Niggas gettin' rowdy now
I been on my own shit for my city, for who I know
All the same hoes know my name
Niggas tryna take my change
Nigga, you can't find me
I got family that'll shoot you
Carry Glocks up on the block
Niggas tryna fuck around
Bitches from the States don't want to come into my city now

[Chorus: Sha Hustle]

I sip this lean, I smoke this sweet

It's Early Birds, we fly together
Yeah, we fly through any weather
Ambitions [?]

Don't get outta line, I'm an outlaw
I fuck your bitch, she gon' give it up

When I hit the mall I just buy it all
I survive a fall, nigga put me down
But I stay up

There's only one way and that's way up

[Chorus: Sha Hustle]
