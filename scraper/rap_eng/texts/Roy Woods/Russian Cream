[Intro]
A man like PJ
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Too much muhfuckin' goin' on
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
The warm up

[Verse 1]
I don't need a bitch, unless she 'bout makin' dolla signs
Rollie on my wrist but I never check it for the time
Said she heard the kid through the boy in the summertime
Said she love my song that I got with Ty Dolla Sign
When I'm in LA I'm fuckin' shorties from Corona
Look me in my eyes say you love me but you love to lie
I can make a hit on four beats forty times (40)
Niggas copy sauce, claim it's theirs, happens all the time
I be switchin' up on these niggas, like my bitch does
18 karat, VVS these ain't no S1's
I don't put no thought into a thot, that's a waste of time
Flying bitches out of the city, come and shoot to mine

[Chorus]
Bought my bitch a new Gucci bag, yeah, yeah (Gucci, Gucci)
Only fuck with bitches gettin' bags, yeah, yeah (bag)
Russian creamy gyal, creamy gyal, yeah, yeah (Russian cream)
Shorty scared of the wasteman, yeah, yeah (wasteman)
Bought my bitch a new Gucci bag, yeah, yeah (Gucci bag)
Only fuck with bitches gettin' bags, yeah, yeah (Gucci bag)
Russian creamy gyal, creamy gyal, yeah, yeah (Russian cream)
Shorty scared of a wasteman, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
You don't know your bitches but I know mine (I know mine, yeah)
Shorty finna hit me on my trap (on my trap, trap, trap, trap)
She gon' give me top playin' Fortnite (give me top, woah)
Shorty wanna fuck I need more time, yeah
Gettin' the bands, gettin' the digits
Bitch, I'm winnin'
God forgive me
Gucci my linen (yeah that's good right there)
Will Smith, I'm a legend
R&B John Lennon
Rap and I sing to women
Bought my weed with the keef, flyin' when you finish
Pussy with the Hennessy for the real niggas
Smokin' blunts, sip the Henny with some real niggas

[Chorus]
Bought my bitch a new Gucci bag, yeah, yeah
Only fuck with bitches gettin' bags, yeah, yeah
Russian creamy gyal, creamy gyal, yeah, yeah
Shorty scared of a wasteman, yeah, yeah
Bought my bitch a new Gucci bag, yeah, yeah
Only fuck with bitches gettin' bags, yeah, yeah
Russian creamy gyal, creamy gyal, yeah, yeah
Shorty scared of a wasteman, yeah, yeah
