[Intro]
South side Nigga for life
She's a south side shawty for life
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been trynna get with you for a minute girl
Thought I turn you down when I can make you mine
Unexplained feeling that I ain't really get into yet
Is there anything else you gotta tell me now
I don't wanna talk bout it coz we'll both get too into it
All I'm thinking bout is you and I don't know why I've been doing it
The feelings you gave me, craving them daily

[Chorus]
Just chain my hands down make love to my body baby
Baby-by-by-by
Baby-by-by-by
Baby-by-by-by
Chain my hands down make love to my body baby
Baby-by-by-by
Baby-by-by-by
Baby-by-by-by
Just chain my hands down make love to my body baby

[Verse 2]
Take it slowly, don't rush this baby
Get in the drive-way
Park it up on reverse
Now hit me where it hurts
No, what about afterwards
Only going forward with you
Yeah
I'm not tired
I'm getting higher
Need a pacifier
Woah I'm rolling
Woah I've been thinking
About the same feeling
The feeling I get from you
Yeah
Why, why am I tired
[?] need a bad girl
I've been working too hard
I've been going too long
Just know I love it on girl
Trying to slow it down with you

[Chorus]
Just chain my hands down make love to my body baby
Baby-by-by-by
Baby-by-by-by
Baby-by-by-by
Chain my hands down make love to my body baby
Baby-by-by-by
Baby-by-by-by
Baby-by-by-by
Just chain my hands down make love to my body baby

[Bridge]
I've been gone for a minute, I haven't called your phone
I know that you’re not home, work in the morning
You can’t sleep over

[Chorus]
Just chain my hands down make love to my body baby
Baby-by-by-by
Baby-by-by-by
Baby-by-by-by
Chain my hands down make love to my body baby
Baby-by-by-by
Baby-by-by-by
Baby-by-by-by
