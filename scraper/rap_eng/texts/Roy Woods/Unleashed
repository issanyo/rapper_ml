[Verse 1]
I still don't like myself
Walk around the fucking city, they still buy my shit
We sell SLV's just discovered in last
Is it crazy to simply talk to god sometimes
I feel the pressure, better make it in last, it's getting harder
Pussy pussy you got it, the fifty yard I caught
Still awesome and flossin' and knocking out the ref
Some niggas want the shit I got before I even got it
I'm a south side nigga for life, I been that
A 333x as far as my wing span
Tonight's still calls for me and these mats
What's next there, you went too quick

[Hook]
This the shit that make a nigga unleashed
We are rough, gotta eat
Me and my niggas are unleashed
Terrorize the motherfucking streets
What you hearin' now, this'll make us unleashed
We are rough, gotta eat
Me and my niggas are unleashed
Terrorize the motherfucking streets
What you hearin' now

[Verse 2]
Should I attempt suicide again?
I still don't see the point in us living in hell
They only watch, this ain't much help
I need a cheque so I can protect more than myself
I am the watch, paradise never seemed so far
Could use a blunt to the face to forget these problems
For a while, cos I done had a enough of this shit
I know I don't see much, so I'm tryna' save us
I made a mistake fucking her raw
Dunno her affection, think she's innocent, oh no no no no
Where your shit at from, the Louis store? nah
Don't fake it to make it for the movie, role nah
You can stay on your block and get your pay though
It ain't even much to get out the state though
Rents kicked you out you need a new place though
But can you stay, yeah

[Hook]
This the shit that make a nigga unleashed
We are rough, gotta eat
Me and my niggas are unleashed
Terrorize the motherfucking streets
What you hearin' now, this'll make us unleashed
We are rough, gotta eat
Me and my niggas are unleashed
Terrorize the motherfucking streets
What you hearin' now
