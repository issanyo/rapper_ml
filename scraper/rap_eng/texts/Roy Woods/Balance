[Chorus: dvsn & Roy Woods]
(Told you)
I don't need love, I know I'll probably fuck it up, oh, (told you)
Ayy (told you)
Drinkin' too much, but let me get another cup, oh (told you)
Losin' my balance (t-)
Swear I, I, I, I, I, I, I (told you)
Remember when I, I, I, I, I, I, I (told you)
Everytime I, I, I, I, I, I, I (told you)
You don't listen every time I try to, try to

[Verse 1: Roy Woods]
Don't talk too much, don't laugh too much
Every time we link up it's a drama ting with you, girl
Bartender need a double over here
Why you tryna bring your double trouble round here?
More drinks, tell 'em with a D'USSÃ‰
Tryna figure out the BS that they (told you)
I told you, don't let them control you
They can't fit in your shoes
You tellin' me old news, blah blah blah
All I hear out your mouth baby
All talk, no walk, I'mma top, lady
Trust me, you'll see, 'cause

[Chorus: dvsn & Roy Woods]
(Told you)
I don't need love, I know I'll probably fuck it up, oh, (told you)
Ayy (told you)
Drinkin' too much, but let me get another cup, oh (told you)
Losin' my balance (t-)
Swear I, I, I, I, I, I, I (told you)
Remember when I, I, I, I, I, I, I (told you)
Everytime I, I, I, I, I, I, I (told you)
You don't listen every time I try to, try to

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
You don't listen when I try to tell you things
Like I ain't lookin' for love, no
Girl I met you in the club
We was just high off some drugs
I hit you off in the bathroom
Then we took it to the backseat
You want that good in the taxi
Stand down, stand down
Trippin', I don't even understand now
Fall in love wasn't in the plan, no
Give you my heart, I can't, no
I'm too busy chasin' these bands
I'm too busy chasin' the lean with the Xans
Girl I thought I told you
I can't talk if I'm sober

[Chorus: dvsn & Roy Woods]
(Told you)
I don't need love, I know I'll probably fuck it up, oh, (told you)
Ayy (told you)
Drinkin' too much, but let me get another cup, oh (told you), ayy (told you)
Losin' my balance (told you)
Swear I, I, I, I, I, I, I (told you)
Remember when I, I, I, I, I, I, I (told you)
Everytime I, I, I, I, I, I, I (told you)
You don't listen every time I try to, try to (told you)
I don't need love, I know I'll probably fuck it up, oh (I need some balance)
Ayy (I need some balance)
Drinkin' too much, but let me get another cup, oh (I need some balance), ayy
(I need some balance)
Losin' my balance (my balance)
Swear I, I, I, I, I, I, I (I need some balance)
Remember when I, I, I, I, I, I, I (I need some balance)
Everytime I, I, I, I, I, I, I (I need some balance)
You don't listen every time I try to, try to

[Outro]
Told you
And I told you
And I told you
And I told you
And I told you
