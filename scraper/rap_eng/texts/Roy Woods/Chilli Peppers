[Intro: Majid Al Maskati]
Oooh
Mister Woods, Man like Maj

[Verse 1: Roy Woods + Majid Al Maskati]
Woah, she knows I'm bad, I like her though (I like her though)
She's kinda cute, not kinda though (not kinda though)
Move it a little bit, body is too fit, oh me, oh my
Shawty been too fine, I can tell she makes 'em whine
[?], you don't want, that's all you know
Go deeper in you, I want what your heart knows is there
Get me throwed, since I'm down, I'll get you good
Can't feel for sure, thought this life could let me know

[Refrain]
She's down for the low, she'll keep it lowkey (she'll keep it lowkey)
She's down for the low, she'll keep it lowkey (she'll keep it lowkey)
She's down for the low, she'll keep it lowkey (she'll keep it lowkey)
She's down for the low, she'll keep it lowkey (she'll keep it lowkey)

[Hook: Majid Al Maskati + Roy Woods]
She's hot as red hot chili peppers, hot, hot, hot
Going on a Californiacation
She's hot as red hot chili peppers, hot, hot, hot
Going on a Californiacation
She's hot as red hot chili peppers, hot, hot, hot
Going on a Californiacation
She's hot as red hot chili peppers, hot, hot, hot
Going on a Californiacation
She's hot as red hot chili peppers, hot, hot, hot
Going on a Californiacation
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Majid Al Maskati + Roy Woods]
Up 'til four yesterday, yes-yesterday
You don't know where I been, where I been
Take it slow, this is just another late night episode
This is just another late night episode
Maybe I should go a little more slow
I'm impatient at best, that's all I know-ow
Baby it sounds like you are on a Californiacation

[Hook: Majid Al Maskati + Roy Woods]
She's hot as red hot chili peppers, hot, hot, hot
Going on a Californiacation
She's hot as red hot chili peppers, hot, hot, hot
Going on a Californiacation
She's hot as red hot chili peppers, hot, hot, hot
Going on a Californiacation
She's hot as red hot chili peppers, hot, hot, hot
Going on a Californiacation
She's hot as red hot chili peppers, hot, hot, hot
Going on a Californiacation
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
