[Intro]
Like that, just like that, like that
Uh, that, like that, oh

[Verse 1]
Pull up with a star, LA in the dark
Come with your girlfriends, roll with a real ass nigga
Hennessy and loud, Cali Kush and woods
Shawty just a lil thick, don't play round with the south side

[Bridge]
Now I can't find no one else who's real as you
Sugar cane sweet as you, love getting geeked with you
Oh let's leave the 6 and have fun out in your ends
And you want to leave your friends, for a Southside nigga again

[Hook]
(That, like that, just like that, like that
Uh, that, like that, just like that, like that
Uh, that, like that, just like that, like that
Uh, that, like that, oh) x2

Just like that with my woes
Just like that back with the drugs
Get to LA from the Southside
DJ got it out the door boi

[Verse 2]
She does it all fast, her bags never last
So she'll come ask me, for a bump and a drive
I'm smoking weed with the hash, she was around for the last
Excuse to the restroom, I'll text Marilyn by sun

[Bridge]
Now I can't find no one else who's real as you
Sugar cane sweet as you, love getting geeked with you
Oh let's leave the 6 and have fun out in your ends
And you want to leave your friends, for a Southside nigga again

[Hook]
(That, like that, just like that, like that
Uh, that, like that, just like that, like that
Uh, that, like that, just like that, like that
Uh, that, like that, oh) x2

Just like that with my woes
Just like that back with the drugs
Get to LA from the Southside
DJ got it out the door boi

[Verse 3]
Smokin' weed, girl I'll lick you from your knees
Don't be shy to ask for me, girl I'll fuck you while sober
I'm the only one up front always willing to stay fly
We're the only ones outside, my high always reach the skies
I hope nothing here goes wrong

[Bridge]
Now I can't find no one else who's real as you
Sugar cane sweet as you, love getting geeked with you
Oh let's leave the 6 and have fun out in your ends
And you want to leave your friends, for a Southside nigga again

[Hook]
(That, like that, just like that, like that
Uh, that, like that, just like that, like that
Uh, that, like that, just like that, like that
Uh, that, like that, oh) x2
