[Intro: TRIPSIXX]
Yeah, uh
Ayo, blast that shit, Maxx
I spent them lonely nights countin' up in the-
Okay, I spent them lonely, yeah, okay

[Hook: TRIPSIXX]
Okay, I spent them lonely nights countin' up in the telly
Phone never stop blingin', I got two cellies
I can't fuck with niggas, man, I swear they so petty
Me and your bitch go together, PB and jelly
Lil nigga, don't tempt me, pull up, leave the clip empty
Two doors on the Bentley, stunt on a nigga if you let me
Lil nigga, don't tempt me, pull up, leave the clip empty
Two doors on the Bentley, stunt on a nigga if you let me

[Verse 1: TRIPSIXX]
Okay, now triple six shortie, man, I swear they not ready
Throw dollars on that bitch like mama's spaghetti
I can't stop countin' up, I'm fetti on fetti
I might hit a lick on a nig' if you let me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got that bag on me heavy
Sippin' on the Effen, if that Henny is Remy
These niggas chase hoes like Forrest Gump chases Jenny
Fuck I look like thirstin' over hoes? I get plenty
Okay, fuck I look like stressin'? Bitch, I'm flexin' on these niggas
Everytime I show up, it's a blessin' for these niggas
I can't get no sleep, no rest, finessin' on you niggas
They don't want beef, let it hit like Tekken on you niggas

[Hook: TRIPSIXX]
Okay, I spent them lonely nights countin' up in the telly
Phone never stop blingin', I got two cellies
I can't fuck with niggas, man, I swear they so petty
Me and your bitch go together, PB and jelly
Lil nigga, don't tempt me, pull up, leave the clip empty
Two doors on the Bentley, stunt on a nigga if you let me
Lil nigga, don't tempt me, pull up, leave the clip empty
Two doors on the Bentley, stunt on a nigga if you let me

[Interlude: Roy Woods]
Brra, woo
Know what the fuck goin' on, man
UTU shit, Unlock the Underground, you know what I'm sayin'
We unlock that shit one time, fuck you talkin' bout

[Verse 2: Roy Woods]
Aye, pop molly, gon' geek
She gonna roll, lovin' the team
All of my niggas, they runnin' the streets
She wanna eat with some niggas that feast
Sabretooth tiger, lil bitch, I'm a beast
Diamonds colder than negative 40
We be makin' hits when we at 40's
OVO, UTU, she know the team
My niggas put yellow tape at the scene
Fuck with my money, turn you to a bean
My niggas show me how to whip 'til it's ready
Make sure that you keep your head steady
I run to the check and I run to the pussy
I'm feelin' like I am Andretti
She want Prada, but I bought her the Fendi
If you 'bout your money, let me know when you ready

[Hook: TRIPSIXX]
Okay, I spent them lonely nights countin' up in the telly

I can't fuck with niggas, man, I swear they so petty
Me and your bitch go together, PB and jelly
Lil nigga, don't tempt me, pull up, leave the clip empty
Two doors on the Bentley, stunt on a nigga if you let me
Lil nigga, don't tempt me, pull up, leave the clip empty
Two doors on the Bentley, stunt on a nigga if you let me
