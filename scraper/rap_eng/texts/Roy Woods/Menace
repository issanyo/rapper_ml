[Intro]
I don't want to be a menace
I don't want to be the menace to fuck up your mind again

[Hook]
I don't want to be the menace
I don't want to be the menace
I don't want to be the menace
I don't want to be the menace to fuck up your mind again
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I told you before I knew it
Girl I was being foolish
I knew I shouldn't of done it but I did it two times again
I'm sorry
I know you do not want to call me
And I understand it
Can I speak some Spanish, "te amo my darling," babe
So what, if I put weed in my car
And I roll a purple cup
Right now I'm not feeling good
So I rolled in my hood
Southside, Southsiders for life
You understand that, right?

[Hook]
I don't want to be the menace
I don't want to be the menace
I don't want to be the menace
I don't want to be the menace to fuck up your mind again
I don't want to be the menace
I don't want to be the menace
I don't want to be the menace
I don't want to be the menace to fuck up your mind again

[Bridge]
Your mind again
Your mind again

[Verse 2]
I've been, so gone, too long, so long
My moms been so worried for so long
Praying on these I know, I've
I've been feeling like this
I need to talk
I need to walk away now, from you girl
These problems, I can't have 'em, I can't solve it
Feel I should pull out the revolver
It's fucked how I've been feeling suicidal
Maybe I should reach for the Bible
I'm still my only rival

[Hook]
I don't want to be the menace
I don't want to be the menace
I don't want to be the menace
I don't want to be the menace to fuck up your mind again
I don't want to be the menace
I don't want to be the menace
I don't want to be the menace
I don't want to be the menace to fuck up your mind again

[Verse 3]
UTU
Back then I was able to, hit her up like
"What are you saying though"
She said "I'm cooling baby"
Come through maybe, my kung-fu baby
Kick it with a nigga
Come on my Lola
She grabbed woods, we're smoking down by the hour
Sex in the shower, it come up for hours
Sex, sex, sex, sex in the city

[Outro]
Raw, raw, raw, raw
Bitch I'm, raw, raw, raw, raw
Hold up, hold up, hold up, raw, raw, raw, raw
Like I'm motherfucking raw, raw, raw, raw
Hold up, bitch I'm fucking, raw, hold up, raw
Still in the 6 I'm a rider (x4) (raw)...
