[Verse: Roy Woods]
You're yelling at my face after all these drugs
You tell me that I change around all these thugs
Movin like you TLC, seein that I’m just a scrub
Never thought that me and you would fall out of love
You said you was always gon' have my back (yeah)
Thief in the midnight you gon' stab me in my back
I’m the fool cause, 3 times I fell for that

[Pre-Hook]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (wow)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (wow)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (wow)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (wow)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (wow)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Crazy. crazy

[Hook]
Is it you, the world or myself that's driving me crazy (crazy, crazy)
Is it you, the world or myself that's driving me crazy (crazy, crazy)
Is it you, the world or myself that's driving me crazy (crazy, crazy)

[Verse: Roy Woods]
I'm so high I don't know what else to do
Why tell lies when I only want the truth
You switchin' side when you on the other side now
Let me derive, what you said you want to drive now
I was in the wrong I know that
Don't tell me that I’m fucked up, baby cause I know that
You love your demons, you know I know that
Wake up from my wrongs, cause I know I ?

[Hook]
Is it you, the world or myself that’s driving me crazy (crazy, crazy)
Is it you, the world or myself that's driving me crazy (crazy, crazy)
Is it you, the world or myself that’s driving me crazy (crazy, crazy)

[Outro]
Is it you, the world or myself that's driving me crazy (crazy, crazy)
Is it you, the world or myself that's driving me crazy (crazy, crazy)
