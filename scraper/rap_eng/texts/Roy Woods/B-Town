[Intro]
I'm in the B's, yeah

[Verse 1]
Know just by the way that you talk
I can tell there's something in you, hoe
Look at me from afar
How would you know you're still beautiful?
Don't know about us at all
This all goes that you been my first
Get in the passenger side of the left
There's something I can't get from her
But then you getting all nervous when your friends
Want a young nigga come through
Shawty, you ain't gotta say much, call me papi
Since I want it like that
How you gon' come through and not get naked with a body like that?
This is me in my final form, shawty

[Bridge]
If you wanna get down, throw another touchdown
Get back to the corner, get slewed couple rounds
If you wanna get down, throw another touchdown
Get back to the corner, get slewed couple rounds
If you wanna get down, throw another touchdown
Get back to the corner, get slewed couple rounds
If you wanna get down, throw another touchdown
Get back to the corner, get slewed couple rounds

[Chorus]
I'm still in the B-Town, I'm still in downtown
I'm still in the B-Town, I'm still in downtown
I'm still in the B-Town, I'm still in downtown
I'm still in the B-Town, I'm still in downtown

(I'm still downtown, I'm still in the B-Town)

[Verse 2]
Might crash the borderline, and just hit up Sauga
And you see her change new whip, can't afford it
I'm a young nigga, grown nigga, been with it
She a bad bitch, looking at us, ain't with it
She let us fuck when she wanna do the whole fitness
I fuck her three times, make her legs shiver
Come, come, little shawty, don't run from it
I got your legs wide open, while your lady’s squirting
I just made it big, now break it maybe
Great, just when I touchdown
I'ma beat the pussy, ruthless
Make sure that ass is still bouncing on a nigga
I need your head from start to finish
You know what’s gwanin' up here in my head
Run through niggas, didn't like what they said
Now all these girls want a trip to my bed
When I'm in the south side, you're with me

[Bridge]
If you wanna get down, throw another touchdown
Get back to the corner, get slewed couple rounds
If you wanna get down, throw another touchdown
Get back to the corner, get slewed couple rounds
If you wanna get down, throw another touchdown
Get back to the corner, get slewed couple rounds
If you wanna get down, throw another touchdown
Get back to the corner, get slewed couple rounds

[Chorus]
I'm still in the B-Town, I'm still in downtown
I'm still in the B-Town, I'm still in downtown
I'm still in the B-Town, I'm still in downtown
I'm still in the B-Town, I'm still in downtown

[Bridge]
If you wanna get down, throw another touchdown
Get back to the corner, get slewed couple rounds
If you wanna get down, throw another touchdown
Get back to the corner, get slewed couple rounds
If you wanna get down, throw another touchdown
Get back to the corner, get slewed couple rounds
If you wanna get down, throw another touchdown
Get back to the corner, get slewed couple rounds

[Chorus]
I'm still in the B-Town, I'm still in downtown
I'm still in the B-Town, I'm still in downtown
I'm still in the B-Town, I'm still in downtown
I'm still in the B-Town, I'm still in downtown
