[Intro]
Ooh
Woah, yeah, ooh

[Verse 1]
You're a queen and I'm a king, just me and you
Tonight is the night to act a fool, yeah
Talk to me and love me
Diss me and I'll act like something new
I need more weed
Hennessy, a little codeine, baby
Just keep it clean
PG, baby
'Til you and me be rated R and you're a star, baby

[Chorus]
Miss, miss, miss
I miss, miss, miss everything
I miss, I miss, I miss
All I wanna do
Something new
Something new
All I wanna do
Something new

[Verse 2]
Talk, talk to me, don't stop
Talk back to me, don't stop
Dancin' on this beat
I got memories for you
I love those walks and talks on beaches
Like we out in Egypt
You give me, mm-mm, cold fever
I am not too tired to go home
Can I take you back up to my room, girl?
I wanna do something brand new
Teach you things that you ain't know was possible
But tonight, girl, you are in my care

[Chorus]
Miss, miss, miss
I miss, miss, miss everything
I miss, I miss, I miss
All I wanna do
Something new
Something new
All I wanna do
Something new

[Verse 3]
I wanna know what's goin' on
So tell me why we talkin' on this phone
Girl, I wanna know right now, right now, right now
No mistakes, no mistakes, nah nah
I cannot have complaints, no complaints, na na
I feel like Offset, no complaints, na na na
Oh na na, oh na na
Talk to me mama
You say "Talk to me papa"
Oh, yah yah yah

[Chorus]
Miss, miss, miss
I miss, miss, miss everything
I miss, I miss, I miss
All I wanna do
Something new
Something new
All I wanna do
Something new
