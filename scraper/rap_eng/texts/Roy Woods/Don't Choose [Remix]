[Verse: Roy Woods]
Choose up, you so quick
When you know that you'll miss me
In your riddah’s ambition
No time for no diss ting
My girl's on a ride, she knows it's a vibe
Every time I multiply my money you know I divide
Girl, can you handle the Hennessy if you can't handle yourself?
Trust my words ‘cause my actions always gonna prove themselves
I say less 'cause Roy and the gang already know us
I don't choose up, baby
Treat a real woman like a lady
Pick you like duck, duck, goose
Pokeball, I choose you
[?]

[Pre-Chorus: Roy Woods]
Don't choose drugs over me tonight
Don't choose Snow White over weed tonight
You'll run the Woods down so forget about the field
Make you feel something you ain’t know was real

[Chorus: dvsn]
I love you and I want to be loved
But I just don't know how to tell you, oh no no
