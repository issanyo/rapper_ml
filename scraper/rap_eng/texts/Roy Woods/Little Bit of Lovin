[Intro]
A little bit of loving
A little bit of something from you

[Verse 1]
Oh
If it's time to make your spouse feel good
I make sure that you got all your plans done right
'Cause I'm not sure
If she was right
That I don't really know what they can tell me
About our love so special
What do they know about our flavor?
Tell me if it's real so I don't slap myself
'Cause there's no point in hidin'
I feel ignited with your love
It's so obvious, I'm sorry that it's pure
Yeah Yeah

[Chorus]
I think I need a little bit of lovin'
A little bit of somethin'
I think I need a little bit of lovin'
A little bit of somethin' from you
Woah, I think I need a little bit of lovin'
A little bit of somethin', yeah
'Cause this love is all I have of you

[Verse 2]
If you like me now, wait 'til you get used to me
This is not no sit down go & get off your feet
We could dance all night, girl come and rock with me
This ain't the same old love that you can get every week (no, no)
Take a trip around the world with me (come on girl)
I will take a chance to get down with you (get down, get down)
My past is my past, leave that back (leave that behind)
I'll give myself to you, woah woah

[Chorus]
I think I need a little bit of lovin'
A little bit of somethin'
I think I need a little bit of lovin'
A little bit of somethin' from you
Woah, I think I need a little bit of lovin'
A little bit of somethin', yeah
'Cause this love is all I have of you

[Bridge]
It's all in her eyes
What we share, you and I (yeah)
It is no more, not the same
But it's all that we made

[Chorus]
I think I need a little bit of lovin'
A little bit of somethin'
I think I need a little bit of lovin'
A little bit of somethin' from you
Woah, I think I need a little bit of lovin'
A little bit of somethin', yeah (just a little bit, just a little bit)
'Cause this love is all I have of you (yeah, yeah)
