Bottle after bottle till you whipping in the same
All you wanna do is fuck until your dead inside your brain
You the main in your section when you wanna give a lesson if a nigga come in stressing that's when you would get your blessing
Then we messing from the bathroom to the kitchen
And you felt it so appealing even when I turn to spit it you were listenin'
And you wanna know just how I been get the old mac
Fuck her friend shawty tell me where the foes at
Blow a whole stack better bring the dro back

[Verse 2]
You feel like you have everything to live for
Till you get stabbed in the back with a pitchfork
Thick whores tryna get up in the whip for a higher status with a clique tryna fuck a rich boy
I would ignore you but you keep on coming after me
Pullin-Pullin me closer to ya, it's like your body's gravity
Girl you actually finna get high with me
While I take over the board like Monopoly
Come and get on top of me
I wanna see you naked I won't fuck you like a basic
As long as you keep it changing girl I love the way you shake it
Shake it like a salt shaker
Girl, old stack quakin'
She a bad girl but she be a good girl later
No time for no haters she wants a little maker
Pussy so good that I had to see ya later
You know that I did it, she want it I give it
I'ma sex her real nice, going deep like I'm digging
Girl in the club
Ass so fat, shawty tell me how you let it get like that
Wanna see you move
Wanna see you dance
We can fuck like this, but have sex like that
If you want some more love
Then you know where the bar is
If you wanna tip, then you know where the car is
We can get it started, damn what's popping
I just wanna get her real wet when it's popping
