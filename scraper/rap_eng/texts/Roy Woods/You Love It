In a drop top 6 on
Got it going on

[Verse 1]
Drop top in the lot at the spot cause I got to pick you up from ya pops
Cause you working at the shop and you're trying to make money everyday because somebody gotta pay
You feeling all these ways
Cause you thinking of the days when you never had shit
It's okay admit they knew you were finished
I got you those clothes cause I knew you in it
Baby do you quit it?
We had it going on from the get-go
You had it going on with the set though
We had it going on when you puttin' on your bra
Before I step up in your room, got to hit it though
I know you really want me to come in it though
I'm seeing through you like a window
You know that I love you
You know that I got you
You know that I need you
You know that I want you
And you love it

[Verse 2]
You know me and you love my shit
She had me and she lost me quick
I've been on the road tryin' find myself
They know me as Roy but don't know me well
I got you again cause they never did
Shit, I'm sipping you again
It's all for you at the end of the day
Girl I gave up my happiness
If it's love then I see you again
If it's not then you mess with your friends
I thought it was good 'til I came back again
Then she got a little drama with her man
Cheating on her every weekend
I get why you don't see him
But then why you can't see me
Though you love it
Understand that it came to some'

[Bridge]
Shawty is this love
Oh, or is this pleasure
