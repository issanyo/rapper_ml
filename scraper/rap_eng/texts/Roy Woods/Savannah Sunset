[Chorus: Tinashe]
What you don't know won't hurt you
Baby, lie to me, I deserve it
What you don't, don't, know
What you don't know won't hurt you
Baby, lie to me, I deserve it
What you don't, don't, know

[Verse 1: MadeinTYO]
I wanna move right
Lately you ain't even been in mood, right (Ooh)
XXX, yeah, "Moonlight" (Skrrt)
I wanna feel your touch, I don't wanna rush (Ooh)
Maybe there's no us (Ooh)
I'm thinkin' too much (Yeah)
I'm lookin' for someone that won't leave me hangin'
I love your voice, girl, and your body bangin'
I wish that we still had trust, wish that there was still us, 'cause (Uh-huh)

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
Out of sight, out of mind
I've been over you
Still feel like in time
You'll be right back home
I'm feeling so much, and I left with so much to say
I'ma just wait 'til you text me
And I'll be passive aggressive again
I'm feeling so much, I've gotta just walk away
We've been going in circles
And now we're going in circles again

[Chorus: Tinashe]
What you don't know won't hurt you
Baby, lie to me, I deserve it
What you don't, don't, know
What you don't know won't hurt you
Baby, lie to me, I deserve it
What you don't, don't, know

[Verse 3: MadeinTYO]
Ooh, can't trust no more (Skrrt)
Make enough money, I can take you on tour (Ooh)
What's your schedule like? Are you busy?
She textin' up my phone like, "TYO, come and get me"
Boss-type chick, she make her own moves (Ooh)
All your exes, yeah, they old news (Skrrt)
Got a million dollars loaded in Pro-Tools (Racks)
What the real feelings like?

[Verse 4: Tinashe]
Baby, don't go
Oh, I just wanna hold you
I just wanna see you under my body
Now, baby, don't go
Oh, I just wanna hold you close
I just wanna see you under my body in slow-mo

[Chorus: Tinashe]
What you don't know won't hurt you
Baby, lie to me, I deserve it
What you don't, don't, know
What you don't know won't hurt you
Baby, lie to me, I deserve it
What you don't, don't, know
