[Intro]
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh nah
Oh no

[Verse 1]
You tell me that you want me
But then you not responding
I'm looking through our convo
Just a blank screen open
Now I'm lookin' at reflections
You always give me suspicions
No lie, me I tell no lie
You stay isolated, for me what you don't like

[Pre-Chorus]
Say your body, astounding, when you found me
You lost you
Said you'll find it, you'll find what?
Don't know what lost inside you
I don't need you comin' 'round
Told you I don't need you 'round
If you wanna stay, then obey the rules baby
Top left get left behind

[Chorus]
Cause, top left, if you wanna get left like Beyonce
To the left, to the left
I be acting right, gotta push you to the left
Uncalled, but you wanna see me daily
Can't talk to you cause I know all your ways
On job, mami, I done see everything
Fresh start if you gon' act properly
(Say goodbye)
'Cause I lied into haze
If it's a vibe, simply talk to me
Don't cry getting in your feelings in bed
When I'm at your side, yeah

[Verse 2]
Watching people drive on the road
Left side watch around 'round with you
I'll let you take the wheel if you want Mrs
I don't mind if you pull up to your mama
Go ahead, girl I know you duckin' low
Got shooters and I know they 'round you
Double-O 7 girl, this ain't no 64

[Pre-Chorus]
Say your body, astounding, when you found me
You lost you
Said you'll find it, find what?
Don't know what lost inside you
I don't need you comin' 'round
Told you I don't need you now
If you wanna stay, then obey the rules baby
Top left get left behind

[Chorus]
Cause, top left, if you wanna get left like Beyonce
To the left, to the left
I be acting right, gotta push you to the left
Uncalled, but you wanna see me daily
Can't talk to you cause I know all your ways
On job, Miami, I done see everything
Fresh start if you gon' act properly
(Say goodbye)
'Cause I lied in a haze
If it's a vibe, simply talk to me
Don't cry getting in your feelings in bed
When I'm at your side
