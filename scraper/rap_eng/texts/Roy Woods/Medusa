[Intro]
Oh no
All she like is
All she like
Medusa

[Verse 1]
I might let it roll
But only with me
Little shorty can go
There's money to blow
Can you get off your feet?
I'm tryna get round wit you
And you know me girl
He don't know I'm too pro
Veterans only
So she fucking with me all the time
She's slewing me low key
Her friend's wanting me low key
I kinda want 'em both high key
I'm likin' how you move like me
Little to say
Don't play with a nigga though

[Chorus]
All she like is gold
I call her Medusa
Same thing with the hoe
Only there when she need me
All she like is gold
I call her Medusa
Same thing with the hoe
Only there when she need me

[Verse 2]
All she like is gold
Shorty on the road
Versace Gucci down when she roll
She spend it all on her
We was in the Bs ridin' down to the southside
See my thots down for the ride for the cause
If she roll with me then it's known she's a sweet girl
Finna beat the hoes that ride for the bus
Blunt in hand left stand shorty ride well I'm high
Ain't seen girls sexier than her
She already knows she's a boss bitch fallin' in love
With a glowed up nigga
I already know I'm a young boss fallin' for her
[?]
She already knows she's a boss bitch fallin' in love
With a glowed up nigga
I already know I'm a young boss fallin' for her

[Chorus]
All she like is gold
I call her Medusa
Same thing with the hoe
Only there when she need me
All she like is gold
I call her Medusa
Same thing with the hoe
Only there when she need me
For a south side nigga

[Verse 3]
All she like is gold, haha
East end [?] and a southside nigga
All she like is gold, haha
East end [?] and a southside nigga
All she like is gold, haha
East end [?] and a southside nigga
All she like is gold, haha
Gold, haha
All she like is gold, haha
Gold, haha
Gold, haha
Gold, haha
Gold, haha
Gold, haha
Shorty got me feeling like I'm on one
Shorty got me feeling like I'm on one
Shorty got me feeling like I'm on one
Stone like Medusa no drug quite like you no no no one
I ride through my city I drive through that bitch, Ryan Gosling
We got plenty of options
But I'm here wit you
Arguin' wit you

[Outro]
Ohhhh
