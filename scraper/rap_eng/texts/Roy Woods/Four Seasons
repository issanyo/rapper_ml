[Verse 1]
I made it out the city quick
Mom finally proud of me
(Mom finally proud of me)
My friends are not my friends no more
(My friends are not my friends no more)
I'm twenty now so I gotta grow up
(I'm twenty now so I gotta grow up)
Barry Sanders with the pick and I sing when I feel it
Went to Toronto and began to fuck with the realest
(Went to Toronto and began to fuck with the realest)
Don't say you listen to me if you ain't hear new music
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, I'm choosin' all these foreigns
Get my mom in a foreign, skrrt, skrrt
Get my dad a new car, get my sister some money
'Cause they always there for me, can never forget it
I would not have known it, more than dollars when I show it
Don't you ever try my lady, I pull up faster than police
You're getting drunk, I can notice
Our side was the focus for the scene but don't look like it
I done came up on the Southside (Southside)
Do it for my moms and my family, I was more than football signed
Singing 'fore 'bout four, three years, what was it for? Only now I know why

[Hook]
Don't you be fake with me
You can be honest with me
Who could relate to me?
Don't go near me like it's Vegas
Man this life ain't no vacation
Don't you be fake with me
You can be honest with me
Who could relate to me?
Don't go near me like it's Vegas
Man this life ain't no vacation

[Verse 2]
Back then I was on my own, little home studio
Ain't no shawty called, don't know why I had this phone
Couldn't, still can't keep a girl, light the blunt I roll
What? It ease my mind, way more than you
OMO, I'm on my own, partying next door
Brought a couple girls, she told her friends to roll
Trees up, with you it was, backwoods to the dome
You just have to answer, so I'm not alone
You the realest one that I met since the runner up
Hope you don't get tired, I'm here like a marathon
When we fuckin', best enjoy yourself before they lose it all
When it buckin', choose your weapon, be like left Ontario

[Hook]
Don't you be fake with me
(Don't you be fake with me)
You can be honest with me
(You could be on this brigade)
Who could relate to me?
Don't go near me like it's Vegas
Man this life ain't no vacation
Don't you be fake with me
(Don't you be fake with me)
You can be honest with me
(You could be on this brigade)
Who could relate to me?
Don't go near me like it's Vegas
Man this life ain't no vacation
