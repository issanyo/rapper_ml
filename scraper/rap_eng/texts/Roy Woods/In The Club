[Chorus]
She said, when I be in the club
Posted with my thugs, that I be so elegant
She can't get enough
I'm looking at your body, yeah and I can't get enough
Just know, it ain't fuckin' love
She said, when I be in the club
Posted with my thugs, that I be so elegant
She can't get enough
I'm looking at your body, yeah and I can't get enough
Just know, it ain't fuckin' love

[Verse 1]
She's lookin' like my ex, maybe I'll take her down
I'm flying to Vancity, ooh these bitches around
I have no patience, I'm tryna get with you right now
She knows I roll with the 6 god, with my angels
Gripping on her body, it's as soft as a Danish
I know you don't understand me, I speak a different language
I bust a French up on her, she poppin' off a Spanish
Fucking with a mamacita that say she from Paris
I'm getting to the money and the money come alive
I'm getting to the money and the money come alive
I ain't got no time for niggas that are tryna fuck with us
And then she pour some Henny, now my head spinning around
I'm rolling off a bean while my shorty put it down
I'm feeling just like Fran√ßois, lightskins around
I got her booted up she don't wanna come down, no

[Chorus]
She said, when I be in the club
Posted with my thugs, that I be so elegant
She can't get enough
I'm looking at your body, yeah and I can't get enough
Just know, it ain't fuckin' love
She said, when I be in the club
Posted with my thugs, that I be so elegant
She can't get enough
I'm looking at your body, yeah and I can't get enough
Just know, it ain't fuckin' love

[Verse 2]
You got a side nigga and you know he ain't shit
Why you staying with him?
You looking at me like goddamn he the shit
How am I gon' get him?
I'm leaning sideways smoking in the driveway
And she up on me while her booty calling
If you getting jealous just slide over me
More speed ahoy that's the link in me
Looking like she been tricking these hoes indeed
And she wanna take the molly and give it to me
I'm feeling myself so fresh, so clean
All white O.V.O 10 swagging on me

[Chorus]
She said, when I be in the club
Posted with my thugs, that I be so elegant
She can't get enough
I'm looking at your body, yeah and I can't get enough
Just know it ain't fuckin' love
She said, when I be in the club
Posted with my thugs, that I be so elegant
She can't get enough
I'm looking at your body, yeah and I can't get enough
Just know, it ain't fuckin' love

[Bridge]
She looking at me
She know my niggas around me squeeze the trigger
And it ain't nothing to me, you pussy

[Chorus]
She said, when I be in the club
Posted with my thugs, that I be so elegant
She can't get enough
I'm looking at your body, yeah and I can't get enough
Just know, it ain't fuckin' love
She said, when I be in the club
Posted with my thugs, that I be so elegant
She can't get enough
I'm looking at your body, yeah and I can't get enough
Just know, it ain't fuckin' love
