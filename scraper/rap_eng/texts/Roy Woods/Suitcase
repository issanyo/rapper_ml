[Intro]
Trust me fam it a mad ting

[Chorus]
Got the bag, and the suitcase
Got the bag, in the suitcase
I mean, up and down
I mean, up and down
Got the bag and the suitcase
Got the bag in the suitcase
Nympho, waiting for
Waiting for, waiting for you

[Verse 1]
Aye is she gone suck me off now
Im mister clean, oh yeah (Im mister clean, oh yeah)
We rock the same colors, love the ice
Like ice hockey teams, oh yeah
Rockin' that body on me, she call me the dream (oh yeah)
Shorty can't come to the crib if she ain't a freak (oh yeah)
Late night shorty said she got a man
I don't care cause she still talking to me
Said she going to the club with her girlfriends
But instead she take an uber to me
Shorty got side niggas on the side
But you know the side nigga never been me
Shorty like thug niggas, from the hood niggas
Well i got a lil hood in me

[Chorus]
Got the bag, and the suitcase
Got the bag, in the suitcase
I mean, up and down
I mean, up and down
Got the bag and the suitcase
Got the bag in the suitcase
Nympho, waiting for
Waiting for, waiting for you

[Verse 2]
Better keep the pussy tight, like some braids like some braces
Shorty be trippin', like she trippin' over some laces
Cause I fuck bitches in places
That she never been to, cause I'm always in the states and
Flying out
Cashing out
Getting the bag
Go for the bands
I roll with Drizzy and PARTYNEXTDOOR, we cool
[?] really love my nigga, but it's Gu-uu-uu-cci
Ooh i just want some bad news, [?]
Shorty wanna fuck, I'll lick her coo-oo-oo-chie
Kitty kitty, yeah I'm singing hella to her kitty kitty
Shorty know she down to fuck a nigga, cause I'm pretty pretty
I can't talk to these niggas cause these niggas and me can't relate
Tell her look up ting, look up ting, come my way
Keep it official, i know a ting can't replace you
You the only one i can believe too

[Chorus]
Got the bag, and the suitcase
Got the bag, in the suitcase
I mean, up and down
I mean, up and down
Got the bag, and the suitcase
Got the bag, in the suitcase
Nympho, waiting for
Waiting for, waiting for you
