Oh, when the snowman brings the snow
Oh well, he just might like to know
He's put a great big smile
On somebody's face

If you jump into your bed
And you cover up your head
Don't you lock the doors
You know that sweet Santa Claus is on hes way

Well, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
Let the bells ring out for Christmas

When we're skating in the park
If the storm cloud paints it dark
Then your rosy cheeks are gonna light
My merry way

Now the frosticals appeared
And they've frozen up my beard
And so we'll lie by the fire
Till the sleep simply melts them all away

Well, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
Let the bells ring out for Christmas

Oh, when the snowman brings the snow
Oh well, he just might like to know
He's put a great big smile
On somebody's face

So if Santa brings that sleigh
All around the Milky Way
I'll sign my name on the rooftop in the snow
Then he may decide to stay

Well, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
Let the bells ring out for Christmas

Well, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
Let the bells ring out for Christmas

Why don't you give your love for Christmas?
