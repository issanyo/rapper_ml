[Intro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa

[Chorus]
Can I hang with you? I'm just tryna hang with you
When I get low you turn me up
Together we're dangerous, well uh
Can I hang with you? I'm just tryna hang with you
When I get low you turn me up
Together we're dangerous

[Verse 1]
You light the pole to get me stuck, tell me who's more dangerous
Like Busta Rhymes so dangerous
Bad lil mama come hang with us
I know, what you came in for, it's not to be on your own out here
And there's friends with you, I got friends but don't [?]

[Verse 2]
I'm addicted to you listening to me
In the clubs that you ship to me
Better keep up the pace with me, la, da, de, da, da
We get lit without ecstasy
I'm so icy, water drip off me
You're my type of person, indeed
You sip Hennessy when you're with me

[Bridge]
First off, I want no lies, open up
I'm addicted, I'm addicted
We both said we won't fall in love
We're both addicted, we're both addicted

[Chorus]
Can I hang with you? I'm just tryna hang with you
When I get low you turn me up
Together we're dangerous, well uh
Can I hang with you? I'm just tryna hang with you
When I get low you turn me up
Together we're dangerous

[Verse 3]
Ooh, push down on the pedal to start my love, yeah, yeah
I get high around you without the drugs, yeah, yeah
No time's wasted if I spend time with you, yeah, yeah
I'm for you now, baby
Do you have what I want? Got weed, and love
Bring my body to the floor, turn me up a lil more
Oh, girl, we got it going on, got it going on
Make me weak your body strong
Hide you went on my life, I lost friends on the highway
Cannot sleep 'til the light
Nocturnal every night, can you spend nights by my side?
Let's get lost on the light, I want to splash your water
Pull out my arms, I got you, I follow my arms

[Bridge]
First off, I want no lies, open up
I'm addicted, I'm addicted
We both said we won't fall in love
We're both addicted, we're both addicted

[Chorus]
Can I hang with you? I'm just tryna hang with you
When I get low you turn me up
Together we're dangerous, well uh
Can I hang with you? I'm just tryna hang with you
When I get low you turn me up
Together we're dangerous
Together we're dangerous
Yeah, turn me up, yeah
Together we're dangerous
Yeah, turn me up, yeah
Together we're dangerous
