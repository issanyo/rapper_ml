[Verse 1]
I got bands but i don't spend no money
Take it in your pants
Said you got friends
I can tell that they're all interested
Baby come and ride on me like a camel in the middle east
About to make a bad man sing
Hitting notes, sing another hit (aye)
Bitches in my DM's and then they fall for me
When you low, want some money you call on me
Shorty say she ain't got no one to call on
You're not the only one I [?] fuck thats lonely
Shorty knows I'm official, theres no boujee in me
I roll with all my brothers LA to NYC
I see the gyal done [?] so they wanna greet me
I call up the girl, but she said [?] to me

[Chorus]
Said she want a real nigga for a bad mamacita
So he can take her out of her clothes (yeah)
Said she love to smoke with me
She ain't even know the D could make her cum
Fall on, fall on
Make her cum, fall on, fall on me
Fall on, fall on me
Fall on, fall on, fall on me (yeah)

[Outro]
Come on baby, say less baby
