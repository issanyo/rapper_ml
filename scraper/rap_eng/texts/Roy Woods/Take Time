And you been running through my mind

I wanna see you turn around, I wanna see you move your body
Now take time off Twenty, let me see you move your body
Now take time off Twenty, now take time off Twenty
Let me see you move your body, now let me see you move your body

[Verse 2: Roy Woods]
You know we got it going on
My weed smoke too strong
Convo still too long
I need to get outta here
Like gyal, you may run the top
Right when we come and bubble up
Your time man mi haffi take
My girl, ya haffi earn respect
I'm young and I'm conscious
We play all of the time we spent
I got lost, another evening
I got lost in your eyes for a reason
She start crying, now she sing along
Ganja make her lungs cough
Take time with your breath now
Don't smoke if your lungs bust
Please don't stop me
I got down for you always
My thoughts, although I'm all rude
Oh yeah
