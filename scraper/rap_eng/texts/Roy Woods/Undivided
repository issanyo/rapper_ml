[Verse 1]
Woah, woah, woah
I don't party on Friday night
I don't  party on Saturday no more
I don't party on Friday night
I don't  party on Saturday no more
I ain't hit the club, drinking at the crib with the bros
Pinching all the ounce from the plug
Shorty so sweet, sour tooth from your kiss girl
Mind is clear when we lay down
Shorty understands me, I'm safe in your arms now
First time for a lot of things now
Shorty you got me weak, weak, weak, yeah

[Chorus]
She understands me
What goes on in my life
What goes on in my mind
(She understands me)
They said you should take time
That's why I'm giving her mine
And it's undivided, -ed, -ed, yeah
Its undivided, -ed, -ed, woah undivid-

[Verse 2]
Running in sauce, flavour, me and my shorty we up
Cut some heads off Medusa's, feel like Breezy chucking up the deuces
If I love her again I'm foolish, wall juke you, NFL street 2 shit
She knew about me and I knew about her,and since I found you I've been booling
Booling, cruising like the King that I made myself yeah
Rocking up my city for my ride
Thinking about myself and I love myself a lot so I feel like Kanye sometimes
In the west side with you rolling Cali bud,we ain't got  no drama since we got our money up
I've told you about the things I'm scared of and they don't trouble you and that's because

[Chorus]
You understand me
What goes on in my life
What goes on in my mind
She understands me
They said you should take time
That's why I'm giving her mine
And it's undivided, -ed, -ed, yeah
Its undivided, -ed, -ed, woah

[Outro]
You wanted, you wanted, you wanted it as much as I
You wanted, you wanted it
You wanted, you wanted, you wanted it as much as I
You wanted, you wanted it
You wanted, you wanted, you wanted it as much as I
As much as I as much as
You wanted, you wanted it
