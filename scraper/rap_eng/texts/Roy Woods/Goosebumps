[Hook: Tripsixx]
A hundred years ago I would've been a house nigga
Now it's 2014 I'm in the traphouse nigga
If Dr King had a dream it surely wasn't this
Cause the only white bitch I trust gave my dog the drips (okay!)

[Verse 1: Tripsixx]
A hundred Hail Marys for these lame niggas
She throw it back like Hail Mary for the change nigga
Touchdown, touchdown for the game winner
Think I'm illuminati rock the feeling out my name nigga
Rolling, all my niggas rolling
'Till the whips fall off this motherfucker 'till it's broken
A hundred Hail Marys for these lame ass motherfuckers acting shady I ain't fucking with them
Off the jump
Had to keep it real off the jump
I'm a cold motherfucker, give your bitch the goosebumps
Ayy, I'm on my knees
Praying for these hating niggas
Imma give 'em hell
Must look like satan to these hating niggas
Stole my first strap from my grandfather
Wish a motherfucker would try it but they never bother
Rolling, all my niggas rolling
'Till the wheels fall off this motherfucker 'till it's broken ayy!

[Hook: Tripsixx]
A hundred years ago I would've been a house nigga
Now it's 2014 I'm in the traphouse nigga
If Dr King had a dream it surely wasn't this
Cause the only white bitch I trust gave my dog the drips (okay!)

[Verse 2: Tripsixx]
I done gone so hard, done gone so hard
Don't give me no more lean
Fell asleep with a lit cigarette burnt a whole through my brand new APC's
I can show you what to do, I can show you what to do
But I guarantee this life not for you
Come and get your bitch, man
She fucking with the crew, what's new
Whole team ball out like IU
Hoes sipping shrooms I could send it to the moon and back
Send it to the moon and back
Run up in your crib with the mask, with the strap
Nigga where the cash, where the stacks? Ayy
The fuck, nigga?
NIgga,[?] bullshit, nigga

[Verse 3: Roy Woods]
Shawty I don't know [?] bout to show me yeah
I been tryna grow up my boys but it ain't even raw [?] yeah
Oh, what a life we live
You ain't even [?]
But you fuck a shawty [?] cause you like to
Shawty I've been doing me
You ain't even know bout the shit I've been getting in
You know I'm on a roll
See me, eyes red like watermelons
I left hell but I'm hard in heaven
These roaches in my ashtray
I'm sorry Mom, I'm still smoking
That nose powder ain't for your cooking
I'm in love with these fast bitches
Those combat bulls make the kickin, If you ain't with it
That's sneak dissin'
Blowing niggas that carry heaters
Chasing dreams I feel like a cheetah
Past life ain't good for me
Went good to bad on my sin, Vegeta
Went super saiyan on these niggas
So I'm sipping lean I've got purple freezer
Downtown like devon (aw shit, I fucked up)
Getting high with my girl from devon
Got two projects I'll never drop them
Your girl still wanna hang with us
This gold chain swang to my
I do a show for these groupie hoes
I got no pros, I dont know how i got here freezing that dog [?]
She's all mine, like Deion Saunders, It's prime time
Got 21 on my black back, imma run it back
For a touchdown, like hail mary, last 5 seconds
I'm going deep, fuck direction
The straight line to the colored section
Grape Arizona, it's so refreshing, I gotta go but you Pmsing
Yeah just wanna dust it, girl can come and sex me
Shawty say she wanna teach me lessons
My life setting like a documentary, Fuck a movie
Ain't nobody here but film me

[Hook: Tripsixx]
A hundred years ago I would've been a house nigga
Now it's 2014 I'm in the traphouse nigga
If Dr King had a dream it surely wasn't this
Cause the only white bitch I trust gave my dog the drips (okay!)

[Refrain: Tripsixx]
A hundred Hail Marys for these lame niggas
She throw it back like Hail Mary for the change nigga
Touchdown, touchdown for the game winner
Think I'm Illuminati Rockefeller know my name nigga
Rolling, all my niggas rolling
'Till the whips fall off this motherfucker 'till it's broken
A hundred Hail Marys for these lame ass motherfuckers acting shady I ain't fucking with them

[Verse 4: Dillian Ponders]
Fuck just give me that pussy
Imma kill that cat,Pass me the blunt
Imma pass that back
Lot of all niggas wanna fuck with the clique
But alot of yall niggas ain't built like that
Before this pill, come and suck this dick
Cause I want a quick nut before the drugs kick in
I fuck your bitch and her two best friends
Wanna step to a nigga then the crew stepped in
I'm fucking hoes on your block
Straight P90X, I've been flexing
Don't fuck around with a nigga bitch test it
I'll put the veterans, pills imma get them
Head to the Weston, back to the Easton
Coke and the bredrins, hoes imma let them
Suck a nigga dick, gotta test them out
Cut a few beats then I let them out
Got that Weston sound, no coaching
I'm a basehead or a dopefiend
I've been coming down but I'm coping
Man i'm so blunt, you can smoke me
Fuck, I was cheating life with that Karma
But I wouldn't put in cheats if she didn't make me wanna
I'm on, plenty things it's a promise
I don't even rap but it's wake up and vomit
Out of my mind, I can act like I'm normal
Barely give a [?] to my ex but me cordial
You're most likely to fuck with the whole time
After my show, you a slave to the hormones
High off of Morphine, back now I'm roadkill
After we're done with pills, we get more pills
Finish all of those, but a nigga want more still
Oh you wife that thing, she a whore still
Don't fear much, I'm the King from the North
Been blessed with the force, cocaine on the floor still

[Hook: Tripsixx]
A hundred years ago I would've been a house nigga
Now it's 2014 I'm in the traphouse nigga
If Dr King had a dream it surely wasn't this
Cause the only white bitch I trust gave my dog the drips (okay!)
