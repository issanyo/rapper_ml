'Bout to put my album out
Say Less, yeah it's coming out
PARTY just copped a new house
Drake won like 13 Billboards at the Billboards, wow
I'ma apply the pressure
I got heat just like the kettle, gotta settle down
'Bout to put my album out
Say Less, yeah it's coming out
PARTY just copped a new house
Drake won like 13 Billboards at the Billboards, wow
I'ma apply the pressure
I got heat, (yeah, yeah) I can't settle down

[Verse]
Hush it down (shhh) Hush gonna hush it down
Chubbs say get my pockets chubby, I got Mary Browns
I was all around, watch when you're around
Jonny pushing pounds
Shots like Niko got the pounds
Shawty give my top, it's the season
40 plus Gadget is a completion
Man like Mark 'em, just gon' give me reason
Mark said I'm a blessing, I believe him
I want 1985 hits with Nineteen85
When dvsn brought me and Maj, Nathan Phillips was live
Oli took em' to the sound side and taught me how to fly
OVO Sound, Sound, Sound, gang, gang, 'til I die
(gang-gangster)
