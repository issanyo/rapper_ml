[Chorus: 24hrs & Roy Woods]
No signal in the hills, no signal in the hills (No signal in the hills)
No signal in the hills, no signal in the hills
Girl, I'ma show you off
Tell me when you ready (Ready)
Smoke a lot of weed, smoke a lot of weed
No signal in the hills, no signal in the hills (No signal)
No signal in the hills, no signal in the hills (Ain't got no signal)
No signal in the hills, no signal in the hills
Girl, I'ma show you off

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
You find a 50, then I'm pussy
We take your girl, boy don't push me
And out the window, I see palm trees
Ain't no service in the hills, if you call me
'Ey, 20, I text you, I missed you
Let's fuck and just work out our issues
Let's get lost up in the mountains
It's millions sold, but I ain't countin'
Why my lifestyle so outstanding?
Fuck, why my pockets so demanding?
I'd rob a bank if we ain't have it
Ain't no signal in the hills, I'm hearin' static

[Chorus: 24hrs & Roy Woods]
No signal in the hills, no signal in the hills (No signal in the hills)
No signal in the hills, no signal in the hills
Girl, I'ma show you off
(Show off, show off, 'cause I'm a show off, yeah)
Tell me when you ready (Tell me when you ready)
Smoke a lot of weed, smoke a lot of weed
No signal in the hills, no signal in the hills (No signal)
No signal in the hills, no signal in the hills (Ain't got no signal)
No signal in the hills, no signal in the hills
Girl, I'ma show you off

[Verse 2: Roy Woods]
Oh, we come from different places, but you found me
I didn't get your call, maybe your signal's weak
I ain't sleep in days, I barely had a play
I know you wanna play the boss
Real life, take a loss
If you try to ruin me, I'll remind you that it cost
Touchy-touchin' me just like your iPhone
Always checking me just like your iPhone
I'm in the beast, Facetiming your girl, no
"Cause you should know that I can't keep me informed
Got no stress, caught at 11
I Uber everywhere, 24hrs and the kid

[Chorus: 24hrs & Roy Woods]
No signal in the hills, no signal in the hills (No signal in the hills)
No signal in the hills, no signal in the hills
Girl, I'ma show you off
(Show off, show off, 'cause I'm a show off, yeah)
Tell me when you ready (Tell me when you ready)
Smoke a lot of weed, smoke a lot of weed
No signal in the hills, no signal in the hills (No signal)
No signal in the hills, no signal in the hills (Ain't got no signal)
No signal in the hills, no signal in the hills
Girl, I'ma show you off
