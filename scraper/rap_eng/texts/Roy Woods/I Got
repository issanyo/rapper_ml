[Verse 1]
She wanna pop pills all night by the ocean wave
I'm tryna get girls all night, different girls say the same to me
All my niggas outta town hold it down
When a nigga come back to the south (yeah, yeah)
Bad bitch wanna go back to the crib
So she can open up her mouth (yeah, yeah)
Make bands, sippin' purp in the broad day
New shades make a nigga act the wrong way
You took a shortcut I took the long way
Now I’m on the highway, why you got a long face?
I've been sleeping in the day working late nights
She only wanna have sex if it songs right, and the thong right
She only wanna get high, smoking all night
Pop a bottle, roll a blunt cause it’s alright
You be doing everything that they don't like
These niggas finna show up if the hoes nice
They only want dimes, what you think the shows like?
Take it back to the whole night
Shorty tell me what you don’t like
So I can come and make it pretty, yeah
I haven't seen you cause I've been working deep in the city
Forgive me for being silly like that

[Hook]
Said I got, said I got, said I got, what you want
Said I got, said i got, said I got, what you want
Sipping hen, rolling spliffs, hitting bongs, smoking blunts
Said I got, said I got, said I got what you want

[Verse 2]
What you want with your man when he come through
Make your pussy pop off like a gun do
Shawty let me slide in her like a sunroof
Every time I touch, your goose bumps erupt you
I don’t wanna be that nigga to corrupt you
I could show you real love while I fuck you
Smoke blunts while the backaz make your bum move
Tun it up, be a rocket I’m a Flintstone
Riding on a nigga really tryna work them hip bones
Word around town she the type that like the get low
Bring her round town and you see her with her pimps' phone
All my nigga's tryna take over the payphone
Damn, now I'm rolling with my nigga's with the cam
Fuck a flash we get in from the back of the club
Cause the fuckboys frontin'
First showcase she the OG stunner while I'm high as shit
Now I flashback to the white girl that I was with
Getting high and shit, rolling round the city with my fire lit
Flying with my pilot, smoking on a violet
I smoke weed cause we done the shit that I’ve been
Now I'm in Toronto tryna look for something bigger
Downtown seeing big things, who figured
Don't fuck around, new age, been trill or go grin up on winner

[Hook]
Said I got, said I got, said I got, what you want
Said I got, said i got, said I got, what you want
Sipping hen, rolling spliffs, hitting bongs, smoking blunts
Said I got, said I got, said I got what you want
