[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
My stroke game
My stroke game on fleek, and I know it
Strawberry pics in the morning
Wetter than Niagra
Worth half a mil in Atlanta
What's your guilty pleasure
Tell me, and don't be scared I might be down
For whatever
She's more wood for the fire
Not just the tip, the entire
She 'gone tell the world if I'm a liar
And I'm not a liar

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Girl, how many strokes
How many strokes
Wanna feel good, wanna feel great
Got 'em feeling good, got 'em feeling
How many strokes for it
How many strokes for it
How many strokes, strokes, strokes, whoa
Why don't you know
Girl want me, girl, girl want me
Girls want this, girls [?]

[Verse 2: Roy Wood$]
How many strokes
How many strokes
How many strokes
How many strokes
Oh, she likes the way the D rocks her socks
I'm going deeper, how you like it
This time you don't have to keep silent
I'mma raise your legs, shawty got me deep-stroking
No games but I freak, always
I'm so used to sex
I know shawty said she from the East End
I'm getting used to the deep end when I dive in
Nine-inches deep when she's riding
I make her legs shake in private
But I was up and giving you the best of me
She ain't going nowhere but tomorrow you better head out

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Roy Wood$]
How many strokes
How many strokes
She wanna feel good, feel good, good
Wanna feel good, wanna feel good
