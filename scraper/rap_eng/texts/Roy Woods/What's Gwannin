[Intro: Roy Woods]
Time to be honest

[Chorus: Roy Woods]
Now it's time to be honest, lovin'
You should tell me what's gwannin', lady
You should tell me what's gwannin', yeah, yeah
Tell me what's gwannin'
Now's the time to be honest, baby
Now tell me what's gwannin', lady
What's gwannin'?
Now is the time to be honest

[Verse 1: Roy Woods]
When you wanna come to, come and pick you
I'ma give you action like a picture
Met you at the party, get you pitchers
I came here to party with the bitches
Come roll South side with a nigga
You're a dime, I'm an ex-killin' nigga
Baby girl, you've always been official
If we break up, I'm keepin' all your pictures
You know that I'm down for you, I'd die for you
I'd listen to your problems while I was gone
Now I'm the only nigga with you
Know that means you in the shower, girl
Niggas sleep on you while my eyes wide open, girl

[Chorus: Roy Woods]
Now it's time to be honest, lovin'
You should tell me what's gwannin', lady
You should tell me what's gwannin', yeah, yeah
Tell me what's gwannin'
Now's the time to be honest, baby
Now tell me what's gwannin', lady
What's gwannin'?
Now is the time to be honest

[Verse 2: MadeinTYO]
Yeah, so much, girl, you could swim
And the lights always dim
Diamonds look like they're movin'
Wonder if it's worth losin'
Tell me that you love me
Hope you ain't a feat
I wanna make history (Okay)
Girl, you look lovely
Hoppin' off flights at night (Skrrt, skrrt)
I wonder if you are hype (Sauce)
Hoppin' out Benz, alright (Ooh)
Off-White, yeah, my Nikes (Racks)
You know you was wrong
You wanna leave me 'lone (Oh, no)
Know the words to the song
(You know the words)

[Chorus: Roy Woods]
Now it's time to be honest, lovin'
You should tell me what's gwannin', lady
You should tell me what's gwannin', yeah, yeah
Tell me what's gwannin'
Now's the time to be honest, baby
Now tell me what's gwannin', lady
What's gwannin'?
Now is the time to be honest

[Bridge: MadeinTYO]
If you love me, girl
Split some bands with me
And you want one more
Let the candles be
And baby, got pillows on the seat
CÃŽROC boy, no Hennessy

[Outro: Roy Woods]
Now it's time to be
Now it's time to be
What's gwannin'?
Now it's time to be
Now it's time to be
What's gwannin'?
