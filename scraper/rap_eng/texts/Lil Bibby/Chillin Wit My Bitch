Chilling with my bitch

Get to feeding niggas clips
Taking niggas lives

Wherever I go
I keep her by my side

Niggas talking shit
She gone have a 50
Get to feeding niggas clips
Taking niggas lives
I know she gone ride
Wherever I go
I keep her by my side

[Verse 1]
Got a bad bitch named nina
Disrespect you might see her
That's the only time you might see her
Cause she be under my t-shirt
Got other hoes that's my bitch
She love to be on my hip
She be all on my dick
Hell yeah I love my chick
I love when she makes that sound
She lay niggas down
That 30 for them clowns
She don't play around
She a bust I don't trust her
I can't leave her with my mans
Plus I might need her and get caught up in the jam
I ain't lying, when I'm riding
She be in my ?
Even though it's not legal
Damn bae I need you
She a bad bitch
She do hits
She shoot shit make him do flips
She need an extension so I went and bought her a new clip
Take her to my office
She hate niggas that talk shit
Won't sell her in no auction
Holding her when I'm walking
I be killing with my bitch
Robbing, stealing with my bitch
She like chilling on my hip
I'm just chilling with my bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She never had no problems
She some like a revolver
She the problem solver
A nigga act up she off em
We starvin, we savage
All she eat is shells
Clip filled with them hollows
I ain't talking Taco Bell
And she got a twin
Might pass her to Rell
Me and her did a lot of shit but she will never tell
She be with the shits
Yeah that's my bitch
And she love the dick cocked
I ain't talking bout my dick
Bibby in this bitch
If I ain't making hits
Then I ain't making shit
And I'm in here with my bitch
Got this 40 on my hip
Leave shorty on this shit
Got this Rollie on my wrist
Now your shorty on my dick
I'm the man, and they know it
Yeah bitch I'm holdin
He acting like he ain't going
Till she get to blowing
Taking niggas lives
She Bonnie, I'm Clyde
That ain't no surprise cause I know my bitch gone ride

[Hook]
