[Hook]
I put money over these bitches cus I'm all about that sack
I just hit a bitch from the back then I sprint right to them racks
Shooting dice in my hood musta lost bout' 10 stacks
I don't ask for shit back, nigga, I'll be right back
I'll be right back
I'll be right back
Say what? *click clack*
Feed his ass that mac
I'm gone off that pack
I'll be right back
Niggas talking smack, hold up
I'll be right back!

[Verse 1]
I move coke no zero
Keep that on the d-lo

Nigga got a problem? Gon' head and solve em
We dont keep revolvers, dice game robbers
We some fucking goblins, 30 in my Robins
Nigga got what? Gon head and rob him
Niggas talking smack? I'll be right back *click clack*
30 clip in that gat, machine guns go brrrattt

You snooze nigga you lose nigga
That's a body on my tool nigga

Remember we used to fight and hit niggas
Baseball bats
Now we stay strapped and shoot at niggas
Baseball caps

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I be in that field
Where niggas get killed
We do hits, no drills
This shit is real
If I dont get no deal
Imma sell dope and steal
Anything for them bills, put me somewhere next to Gill
Sneak dissing, fake niggas don't wanna meet me face to face
Im ridin round with my gun nigga and a young nigga that'll take the case
Kick a door, I need cake
In the booth I go ape
I better eat for your sake
Or im eating stealing off yo plate
Big bucks I stack
Spend it all on gats *click clack*
Stain me shooting craps
Somebody getting jacked
Another nigga get wacked and that's every time I come back
10 bodies that's max
Gotta trade my mac
I'm smoking

When I come back they hiding
That 40 with that silence
Cock it back and im firing
Dont give a fuck who hiring
Bibby, I got work
My nina gon' twerk
Put you in that dirt
