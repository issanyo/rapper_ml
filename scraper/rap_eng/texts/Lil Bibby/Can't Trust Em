[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I can't trust these hoes, they won't catch me slipping
I can't cuff these hoes, I ain't like these niggas
I just be chasing that paper
I just fuck her I don't wanna date her
I ain't really got no time fuck her you can have her back later
I can't trust these hoes, they won't catch me slipping
I can't cuff these hoes, I ain't like these niggas
I just be chasing that paper
I just fuck her I don't wanna date her
I ain't really got no time fuck her you can have her back later

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Niggas be cuffing these thots
Kick that hoe out of the spot
Is you gon suck it or not, got that bitch fucking the block
Niggas be dropping them dimes
My money I need all of mine, lately I been on the grind
Wish I could buy me some time
I'm tryna buy me that wraith, check out the look on they face
I keep them racks in the bank
Make sure my money is safe
You know I hang with the shooters
I tell them to do it my youngings gon do it
Young nigga came in the game
Them crackers they gave me that check and I blew it
I bought some gucci and louie
I hit the club and I threw it
Bought a few Glocks and some rugers
It ain't a no doubt that I'll use it

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I can't trust these hoes, they won't catch me slipping
I can't cuff these hoes, I ain't like these niggas
I just be chasing that paper
I just fuck her I don't wanna date her
I ain't really got no time fuck her you can have her back later
I can't trust these hoes, they won't catch me slipping
I can't cuff these hoes, I ain't like these niggas
I just be chasing that paper
I just fuck her I don't wanna date her
I ain't really got no time fuck her you can have her back later

[Verse 2: Don Q]
The summer is ours
We plotting on fucking the winter up
They mad that we fucking the city up
We made it this ain't no beginners luck
Gang gang in a sprinter bus
My chain hang and it's glittered up
These hundreds is stuffing my denims up
Foreign bitch cheffing my dinner up
We started off dealing yay
Now I can wheel a wraith shopping for real estate
Show me respect when I'm in ya state
Famous or not I still be where the killers stay
I got a check on me anyday I can spend 10 a day
Might do a "day in the life" just to demonstrate
Bitch have my money and don't be a minute late
Ice like I figure skate white on my dinner plate

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I can't trust these hoes, they won't catch me slipping
I can't cuff these hoes, I ain't like these niggas
I just be chasing that paper
I just fuck her I don't wanna date her
I ain't really got no time fuck her you can have her back later
I can't trust these hoes, they won't catch me slipping
I can't cuff these hoes, I ain't like these niggas
I just be chasing that paper
I just fuck her I don't wanna date her
I ain't really got no time fuck her you can have her back later

[Verse 3: A Boogie]
I came from the mud I hopped out it
They never know when I got it
2 bullet holes like "who shot em?" ring on ya nose I 2Pac em
My gun by the bread when I count it
I got to watch for the feds I switch houses
I jump in the benz and look out it
If it ain't about the bread then I doubt it
I run through some bands
When I count it I gotta do it again I recount it
I do it again if I got to choose you over Benjamins I promise
Money over everything I promise
I be counting money everyday I got it
I keep hunnits only in my Goyard wallet
Louie luggage for the bank deposit
Treat it like a sport so you can say I'm balling
If it came from paris then I probably bought it
New Givenchy then you know I'm on it
If it ain't designer nigga I don't want it

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I can't trust these hoes, they won't catch me slipping
I can't cuff these hoes, I ain't like these niggas
I just be chasing that paper
I just fuck her I don't wanna date her
I ain't really got no time fuck her you can have her back later
I can't trust these hoes, they won't catch me slipping
I can't cuff these hoes, I ain't like these niggas
I just be chasing that paper
I just fuck her I don't wanna date her
I ain't really got no time fuck her you can have her back later

[Outro]
I can't trust these hoes
"The summer is ours we plotting on fucking the winter up"
I can't cuff these hoes
"Is you gon suck it or not? Got that bitch fucking the block"
I just be chasing that paper
I just fuck her I don't wanna date her
I ain't really got no time fuck her you can have her back later
"I came from the mud I hopped out it"
