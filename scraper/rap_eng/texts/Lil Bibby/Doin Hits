[Intro]
The morning dance is not a good way to start 2013
And the numbers are climbing
When it comes to gun violence in the city of Chicago
We’re learning so far this weekend
All the victims have been teenagers
We have learned about at least five different shootings since Friday afternoon
And at least 6 teens have been shot, two of them have died
In just 12 days into 2013
And there's now a total of 22 homicides

[Hook x2]
We be doing hits
When we get off the shits
We ride on your block and get to lettin off clips
We be doing hits
We be doing hits

[Verse 1]
Uh, my youngins with the shits, they be doing hits
When I get in the booth, I be making hits
Nina on my hip, the 40 in the dip, (yeah)
Nigga ride through, his car getting flipped
No this is not a myth, I know you know Lil Chris
I have 'em blow you down, now its hot up your strip
My lil bro he a trip, he don't care about shit
And he'll hit you up, while you riding with this bitch, (yuup)
Kill them if you get, (fuck it!)
We got guns to pick, (yeah)
I just bought a Glock 9 with the rubber grip
Keep that in the whip, dirty Sprite I sip (sip)
Roll up gettin lit, when they bored, they do hits!
We gonn park da whip, and (gone spot a pick?
Let the choppas whip, R.I.P, you will be missed
Say we gonn park the whip, and (we gone spot a pick?
Let the choppas whip, R.I.P, you will be missed

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I work late nights so it's no sleep
And these broke niggas be so cheap
And every nigga that know me
Know, I will never ever go sleep!
Sellin dope ducking police
Young nigga riding foreign now
Cause niggas pay to hear me and bro speak
These niggas is so weak, and I’m so hot, they so not!
Niggas talking that gangsta shit
But I don't never see you on your block
Find out where you hiding at and
Go Masked up and run up in yo spot
Got K rounds, put ya face down
Where the cash at?
I shouldn’t even have to ask that!
Make a move
Imma blast that
Dropping bodies like Mad Max
Red bone and her ass fat
Imma smash that, then pass that
Like Chris Paul on the side line til I get called
Niggas ain’t on shit y'all, they just talk a lot, but don’t shoot shit
Same nigga that got shot, and ain't do shit!
Feeling good buy a new whip
Some new kicks, a few fits to come splurging
Knew I'm back when I was serving
Now I'm foreign car swerving
Lil Bibby go too hard and these rap niggas get nervous!
I got shooters at my service...
