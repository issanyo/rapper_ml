[Hook]
I swear to God, this what I live for
If you ain't getting money, what you here for?
This what I been grindin' as a kid for
If it ain't money, nigga, what you live for?

[Verse 1]
Riding in a Range, look in my eyes, you see the pain
Having convos with my granny, she just tryna keep me sane
She told me since a youngin' you and them boys weren't the same
I can tell by your actions you was in another lane
And I'm on the same stuff, I can never change up
Niggas telling names, huh? That'll get you flamed up
Riding in the Benz, I've been in the zone
Catch Bibby all alone, now I'm gripping on the chrome
Niggas hit my phone, tryna cop a zone
Nigga must be working, man what type of shit he on?
I can tell by how he talking, that nigga done lost it
Tryna put a case on me, you know that that's gon' cost him

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
Nigga what you live for?
Niggas taking risks for the money, doing years for it
Gotta feed them kids boy
Grinding so hard, I don't do it for myself
Long as the fam straight, who gives a fuck about my health?
Look, weighing up them grams, that's how I learned mathematics
Stunting for these hoes, these youngnins hustle ass backwards
Them old heads didn't give them the game
These boys lost, man, that shit is a shame
And when them boys rolled up, I seen niggas froze up
These the same niggas, they be acting like they so tough
Boy, you need to stop it
That act, you need to drop it
Niggas in the streets know I'm all about a profit, huh

[Hook] x2

[Bridge]
Cause I don't need nobody's help
Said I don't need nobody's
