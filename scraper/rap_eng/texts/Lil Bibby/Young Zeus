[Verse 1: King Vory]
I showed up late to the party
Razor blades, shit a part of me
White bitches gettin’ naughty
Off the Xannys and the molly
Turned up in the party, turned up in the party
Shawty off the Xannys, shawty off the mollys
Tryna go retarded, tryna go retarded
I blow a bag on the molly, I blow a bag up in Follies
Don’t talk about it, ask about it
Ask about it on a body
All of my bitches exotic
Check on a kid like deposit
She check on the kid like deposits
Ask about me, ask about me

I run my hood like Nino
Take your chain like Debo
Choppers everywhere we go
Toting shit like it’s legal
Niggas working with them people
Told that bitch I don’t need her
Fucking with a young boss here
You don’t like me, get lost here
I just been trapping for days
Real nigga, I cannot change
I’m just like back in the days
‘Cept I got them racks and I’m paid
Boy you new to the hood
Like a zoo in my hood
I bring my crew to your hood
Start shooting in your hood
They know I’m still with the gang
I keep it real with the fame
NWA, I’m just a nigga with aim
You better watch what you say
I get you shot in the face
I keep it silent like ace
That’s why I’m still in the date
