[Interlude]
What does Free Crack III mean to me?
Free Crack III means everything to me
It's everything that I went through this past year
Mixed with everything that I've learned throughout my life
I put time, feelin's, into this project
And you can hear it in the music
Listenin' to FCIII, you can hear when I'm happy
You can hear when I'm mad, you can hear when I'm depressed
With me and my career, it's been a process
I've grown and I've learned things
I'm so proud of myself for that too
Because with music, I take care of family
I get to help friends, I get to expose them to new things
To help open up they minds
Plus I got a nephew, I get to show him a better life
And I want people to know that it's not easy
I come from hustlin' on street corners, gettin' into shootouts
And livin' with my mother without a care in the world
We had section 8 food stamps
So the only thing I had to worry about was gettin' fresh, you know?
So, I hustled and I had to worry about not gettin' killed
Because there was back and forth shootin's every day and stuff
And now I have like every responsibility in the world
And it's not easy
I'm workin' on myself every day
And I just hope that you guys can appreciate the music
And have as much fun listenin' to it as I had making it
