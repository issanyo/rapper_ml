[Verse:]
I been grindin' for weeks, ridin' with the heat
I'm a real nigga I ain't hide from the beef
Plus I gotta lot of tasks to the streets
Got some young niggas on the ave with the D
Everything for the low, sell mine for the cheap
You ain't gettin' money you ain't buyin' it from me
She givin' brain if she ridin' with me
She say she love me but she lyin' to me
But I just use her for the night then duck em'
M.O.B boy we don't cuff em', we don't love em'
These hoes bustin', we just fuck em'
We can't trust em'
And I'm married to the money need a wedding ring
I was broke not a kid need everything
I remember when a nigga had hoop dreams
Nigga playin' both sides like he got 2 teams
Pull off on the lot whip too clean
Way I'm ballin' you would swear I had a few rings
Every month I'm trying to pull up in a new thing
Everyday I'm on a hunt for some new grain
If I want it, I bought it, I'm ballin'
These hoes keep callin', they stalkin'
Look Bibby don't care what it cost him
These groupie hoes won't stay off him
