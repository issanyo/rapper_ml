[Intro]
This bitch call me one more time talkin' crazy on my mothafuckin' phone
Bitch you better quit callin' my fuckin' phone
I'ma break her mothafuckin' neck
I swear I'ma strangle that bitch

[Verse 1]
Watch what the fuck that you say to me
I hang with killas, don't play with me
My mama, she told me she hated me
Now she be calling' me, tryna get cake from me
You know that I live with the chopper
It sleep in the closet, I told it, "Come lay with me"
I turned the trap to an agency
Didn't want to, but they're makin' me
I'm supposed to be keepin' the peace
But I swear these young niggas unleashin' the beast
Man it ain't no love in the streets
I fell in love with my heat
Caught me an oppa in traffic
My bro started clappin', left blood on the seats
I left your cousin deceased
Cause he would have done it to me
Bibby, I'm back on the grind
I keep them stacks on my mind
My squad like a pack of them lions
We trap with a 9, packin' the iron
I think the devil took over me
I swear that I think it's a ghost in me
I took my gun to the store with me
It don't want leave, I'm like go with me, go with me
I whip with the left, I'm Ginobili
K in the trunk like some groceries
He wanna fight cause he see that his hoe with me
I got my pipe, I aim right at his ovaries
Yeah I know I said ovaries
Cause he a bitch, he a hoe to me
All of my killers'll go for me
I just might open a trap right on Oglesby

[Hook]
Watch what the fuck that you say to me
Out here with killers, don't play with me
Watch what the fuck that you say to me
All of my niggas is killers, don't play with me
Watch what the fuck that you say to me
Out here with killers, don't play with me

[Verse 2]
Gotta let the sauce drip a little bit
Niggas copy my swag, had to switch up my shit
So fresh and so clean when I came on the scene
I was fresh to your team
Out here with Benjamin Franklins
Hundreds and 50s, I say the shit
I need to bang, I've been tastin' it
She want attention, can't notice it
Know that a young nigga paid
Cops tried to call for a raid
Your boyfriend, he work like a slave
It look like he need a raise
You know that your wifey been hittin' me
Want me to take her to Italy
Know that that bitch can't get shit from me
I fucked her, then took her to Mickey D's

[Hook]
