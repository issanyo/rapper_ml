[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
I was 15 years old in the trap bagging dimes up
Then I started rapping got these crackers tryna sign us
Niggas kill my dawg we can't put that shit behind us
Like should I caught that billy? Shit, I still ain't made my mind up
You ain't never did no time huh, never been in no line up
Never had to go rob nun, never tote no iron huh ?
Yeah, I heard I posted behind huh
It ain't too hard to find us
Im still doing my sing up we crack baby don't mind us
I'm so weighed I lost my dawg to the streets, it ain't no peace
We ain't squashing shit, who you going call it ain't no keep
Shawty know I'm rich, she got a man but she going to cheat
I swear ever since I got the gwop they M.O.B

[Chorus]
Yeah, that's facts (x5)
They like shawty spit that crack, yeah that's facts
Shawty keep a gat, yeah that's facts
You know I ain't moving packs, yeah that's facts
Blew that check and got it back, yeah that's facts
Yeah, that's facts (x5)

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Phone booming, like the motherfucking trap
Diss me, can get motherfucking slapped
No already, you get motherfucking clapped
The soda was dirty soon as I twisted off the cap
I put us on the motherfucking map
We'll put a nigga's governement on the bullets and the scrap
Your whole face in my motherfucking lap but I told that bitch to stop, I got to finish this lap
I'm flyer than a motherfucking seagull
His name is 3 times, that's a motherfucking redo
Yeah that's facts, motherfucker, it ain't see through
Step red nighters bankroll like I need you

[Chorus]
Yeah, that's facts (x5)
They like shawty spit that crack, yeah that's facts
Shawty keep a gat, yeah that's facts
You know I ain't moving packs, yeah that's facts
Blew that check and got it back, yeah that's facts
Yeah, that's facts (x5)
