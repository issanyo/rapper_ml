[Hook]
I said bitch I'm gon get money and that’s with or without you
Youngin doing your thing, you coming up, they gon doubt you
That’s why I pull up in this foreign just to stunt on these haters
Then I pull these racks out just to show that we made it
I say fuck these other niggas, ask your bitch, I’m her favorite
Catch me in the club, they bring bottles to the tables
And I ain’t fucking with these niggas, man them niggas some haters
We pull up in them coupes just to show that we made it
Yeah we made it

[Verse 1]
They know I’m the truth, pole in the coupe
Run up on me, then you know Imma shoot
And I spit crack when I go in the booth
50 shot MAC, I’ll blow it at you
Bout to go insane, watch niggas switch up when you get famous
When you get a little money, watch shit changes
And I walk around my city like a big stain
20k for this big chain
30 thousand dollar wrist game
Work hard and this shit came
Smack a bitch like Rick James
Niggas hating, tell em do something
I bet they won’t do nothing
Going hard since 2 somethin
Any nigga round me gon shoot something

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
See I spit that crack, niggas on that hype shit
Cause they ain’t never ever heard shit like this
Say fuck a gun law, Imma carry my shit
I be judged by 12, you be carried by 6
Do it by myself, cause a nigga might snitch
Never leave a witness cause the shit might stink
Nigga I’m just tryna ball, wanna see a nigga fall
Nigga telling on they dogs like a nigga Mike Vick
See I’m getting cake, got guns on our waist
We see an op in here, then we shooting up the place
And we riding with the K, in a high speed chase
Man if shit get real, then we shooting at the jakes

[Hook]

[Outro]
We made it [x5]
Nigga we made it
Bitch we made it
We made it
Yeah we made it
We made it
Gone
