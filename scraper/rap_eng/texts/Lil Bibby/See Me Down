[Hook]
Niggas wanna see me down
I gotta' keep on goin'
I know niggas wanna see me down but I can't stop for nothin' now
I been goin' through some things I smile and I don't show it
I can't let my family down I gotta keep on goin'

[Verse]
I come from the bottom the bottoms
They told me get 'em I got 'em
Got 30 shots no revolvers
In case we run into problems
Its real
Niggas want beef you get killed
No talkin' speak to the steel
Don't give a fuck how you feel
Ain't in no rush for no deal
I swear I hate them pretenders
I know they hate that I'm winnin'
I see they face when I'm in it
Man they can't take the beginnin'
I just wanna ball
Staring at them stars
They dreaming 'bout cars and fuckin' movie broads
Do You think I give a fuck what a bitch say?
And I use to post up tryna' get cake
Game time man I'm waitin' on a big day
Come through in the clutch like MJ
They had me on them ropes
I ain't have no hope
My pockets they was low but I don't stop I go

[Hook] x2
Niggas wanna see me down
I gotta' keep on goin'
I know niggas wanna see me down but I can't stop for nothin' now
I been goin' through some things I smile and I don't show it
I can't let my family down I gotta keep on goin'

[Verse 2]
I use to post up by that wall
Right there by that stall
With my dogs
Weed up in my draws
Runnin' from the law when they was called
Price you put in is watchu' charge
Y'all too high can't fuck with y'all
They locked me up so fuck the law
Remember I used to fuck with ball?
Mobbin' in my grey hoodie
I move work like Ace Boogie
Fuck a broke boy they rookies
Bro whip up them straight cookies
Bags big I'm killin' them
Shots boost my adrenaline
The plug I use to sit with him
I don't talk to middle men
Diss her like that old Gucci
Don't respect them ole goofies
Cops pull me over I use to hide it in my hoe coochie
This was just last winter
You know I remember
Now I'm getting' rap money and I'm bout to kill em' Uh!

[Hook] x2
Niggas wanna see me down
I gotta' keep on goin'
I know niggas wanna see me down but I can't stop for nothin' now
I been goin' through some things I smile and I don't show it
I can't let my family down I gotta keep on goin'
