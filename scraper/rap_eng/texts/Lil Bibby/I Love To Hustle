A nigga like me man... I love the game
I love the hustle, man
Be feeling like one of them ball playing nigga, you know?
Like Bird or Magic or something
Yeah, you know, a nigga got dough
A nigga could leave the league
But if I leave, the fans still gon love me man?
I get love out here in Harlem, man
I done sold coke on these streets man
Hash, weed, heroin
As long as niggas is feeling it, a nigga like me can hustle it
That's my gift in life, A. You know?
