[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Pull up (skuurrt)

And my Balmains
Got knots in this bitch
Reach for my chain
Get shot in this bitch

You know I'm a savage I ride wit the stick
I make a call and I get em' hit

Bitch G Herbo I be lit
You know I'm fresh as a bitch
Chrome wheels on the M6
You know it match wit the stick
30 clip right in the whip
I don't got no license for shit
We party we like kickin' it
We ain't wit that "fightin' and dip"
We countin' we like dividends
See the plug I don't like middle men
I do what I want I don't care bout' the police they just gotta come get me then
Them bad bitches love me
Yo hoe wanna fuck me
She drunk got her off Remy and Henn
She callin' her buddy
They both gettin' slutty
They fillin' the kid wit a Cudi
Say I make her nervous
I used to be grumpy back when I was sippin' the muddy
And I got 2 Rollies
A fourty
Two fourty when one wanna play one bezel floody
And I wit no lovey dovey
All these bitches be all lotty thotty
Turn her up make her get off a Molly
Now I'm gettin' top in a Maserati
And you know I be off the shits snail in this bitch
Fuck niggas make me sick

Haters like fuck Herbo stay cryin' broke I know he rich
