[Hook]
Oh that's your partner? Man it look like he'll tell some shit
Nigga get up off your ass, go and sell some shit
My connect just hit me up, said he gon' mail some shit
Told him send that 40 back I get it gone I could handle it
I'm Steph, Steph, Steph
I got aim Bitch I'm Steph, Steph, Steph
Long range Bitch I'm Steph
I got love for the game Bitch I'm Steph
I got love for my gang

[Verse 1]
I was the champ in my spelling bee then I dropped out of high school and start selling weed
I don't know what done got into me
Are you a friend or a enemy?
I know they wanna get rid of me
Plotting on killing me
Do me like Kennedy
I know these haters not feeling me
But you know I can't go that easy
Ride with them choppers believe me
I keep a 30 believe me
Al Capone in the flesh, Steph Curry at his best
Pop a Xaney for the stress
Bout to go run up a check
I can not front you a quarter
I need 800 for that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Bitch I'm bout that action, I'm not with the cappin
My hittas start clappin', that shit will get tragic
And we got 30 shot clips in them ratchets
Play with the gang and you know what'll happen
We totin' them Glocks and they plastic
Know them hi-points jam like traffic
And you know that we not with the acting
Ain't none of my killers sarcastic
Snitch niggas try to blame us
I swear that they fucking the game up
I keep some money for bail
Jewish lawyers on retainer
I get that work through the mail
I keep a digital scale
I know I'm going to hell
Yeah I know I'm going to hell
