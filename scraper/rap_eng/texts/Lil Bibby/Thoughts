Im going crazy as shit
Its me against the world and they waiting for me to slip
The city that I come from is hateful as shit
The devil in my ear got me praying this shit
And these are private thoguths what im saying is shit
When I know damn well I shouldn't be saying this shit
Just to make em happy if they know a nigga down
So i buy a new car everytime I come around
Just to feel proud

[hook]x2]
Im slipping, im falling, I can't get up
Ayo im slipping im falling I can't get up
Ayo im slipping im falling I gots to get up
Get back on my feet so I can fuck up the streets

[verse]
I remember I was starving I swear you could see my bones
Now im getting fat, cause my money getting long
And I smile on pictures but some shits been going wrong
Lotta shit been going on so I put it in a song
And my Glock up under my pillow, im laying in my bed
Tryna block these crazy ass voiceas out my head
I got, niggas doing years and a, Couple homies dead
And im a stacking paper boy so what am I complaining
For, I guess its just the fame or, this whole rap game
I just been depressed thats why i spent 20 on this chain
For, Alotta niggas been hating but these bitches scream my name
I just cut on me some future cause its like he feel the same
Im the man in my city, they should just crown me
Couple street partnes sneak dissing tryna down me
All these new faces, MAn i guess thats just how it be
If you dont know my real name get the fuck off round here
