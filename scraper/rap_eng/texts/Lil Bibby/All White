Verse 1: (Lil Bibby):
Bitch I think I'm Tony Dolo but my pipe is on me
See me stuntin in that foreign, I know that's a striker, homie
Actin' like you savage, I know you ain't like that homie
Judge gave my youngin' 20, better fight that homie
Look what we did, where I came from
Now we out busting them bricks at the table
Nigga try to play with my money, I promise you I don't get high like a savior
My youngins' be selling that white, you want a brick you can get it tonight
My hitters be blowing on sights, think it's a game, play wit your life
All that I hang with is savages, hop out the whip and they 'bout that shit

And I done spent too much wildin' in Wraiths, to get called and arraigned
And what the fuck is a miss?

And she finna drop her draws, and I'm finna lock her jaws
Told her my bro is involved, leave a bitch nigga cold in the hall
Silly nigga, you a bitch on the hit list
I'd be damed if I'm trailin' on his shit, plus I'm tryna' catch a nigga off the hit list
Matched up, better not get to witness
Bitches bark on A.K.A. mister Sprite
All black, need a pint of that nice
White is a fight, I got my pipe, say hello to Christ

Four different white whips, braggin' 'bout my white bitch

Presidential Rollie nigga, watch me roll my white wrist
In the kitchen cookin' moppin' just last Mossi Blocko
All white bird flyin' in it's from El Chapo
Almost 15 hundred I done made up off this rap shit
First inside a trap now we hot off in this rap shit
I'm feelin' myself runnin' bands up
