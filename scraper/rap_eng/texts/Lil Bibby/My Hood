[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Terror town, no limit gang, MB, we let pistols ring
Lil Bibby, I dare a nigga try to jump silly, lot of new niggas trying to
Fuck with me, I don't fuck with guys that ain't 150, and the opps scared
To come near me, cause you know a nigga keep the pump with me; I be posted up with my
Crew nigga, trigger happy, we shoot niggas - move around, who is you, nigga?
Who is you, nigga?
My little niggas do take downs with the trey pound, put your face down
If he don't get down, make him lay down - if he try to run, get chased down
Let him hear how the eight sound, now they got yellow tape 'round
They was sleep, but they awake now, and my hood don't play around

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
If you ain't from the Eight Block, better move around
An't no walking on the set bitch, cause we reckless
We'll shoot him down
Work a nigga like he losing pounds
Vito City, our name ranging
Throwing signs we gang banging
Black Mob ain't no shit, don't tell shooter we name changing
That's on the guys
Run up on him with the black Mag
In the black mask, leave him on his ass
We whacking shit, and that's no surprise
If you lowkey, better hope it last, cause we on that, And I don't think y'all want that
Leave a nigga stinking on Colfax
Speeding in the Lincoln no throwback
Now I'm back up on the Essex block
.30 poppers with a extra Glock, my niggas got 47 sweating hot
So you better run when that beretta cocked
