Who ya know more blessed than me?
Who ya know more blessed than me?
Who ya know more blessed than me? Jesus
Twelve shots got me sweatin' like a preacher
Got da holy ghost, got da holy ghost
Hit the lot, drop that bag, got' da holy ghost
Got' da holy ghost, got da holy ghost
These chicks shakin' ass like they got' da holy ghost
Got' da holy ghost, got da holy ghost
These chicks shakin' ass like they got' da holy ghost

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Who he came with, bitch, it ain't you
How we shop so much, cause bitch, I got the loot
Can't believe he's still going', bitch cause I'm da truth
30 bandz a night, where can I put the whole crew?
Walked inside the dealership, then I payed cash for the Coupe
Press one button ho now you looking' for the roof
Juicy J rock many shows with his Oscar mane plenty many hoes
Yo bitch came in her pantyhose and I sent her home with no panties on
Faded and famous, ratchet pussy, the greatest
Pushing  Mercedes, getting' topped from yo baby
You hustle 2 years, you still broke
I sell lean, sound like I sell dope
Swimmin' in these benjamins, in anotha year I'mma need a sailboat

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
When I walked thru, ho shake that ass, I'm the man Lil Bibby
And I move light, got a couple killers and a lot of dollars with me
To my L's up high, yea, I rep that shit
Did a lotta dirt, don't regret that shit
Catch a flight, no luggage, man I left that shit
Niggas hate on they partner, mane I hate that shit
Niggas talk, I swear y'all niggas feel awesome
Drive by in a foreign whip - walkin'
Yo main chick told me she's stalkin', quit callin'
It's me and Juicy got the old skrill
Pass around, we tag team
Old school with the glass ?
Hit the mall with the ? and a ?
Yung made nigga, my big homies got a hunnit M's
When you say go hard, in a couple years you a hight ten
I ain't been asleep in 2 days, tryna find a way to get 2 payed
Doin' all that talkin', nigga shoot sum'
Niggas flexing', you don't do nuttin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Money on my mind, money in my pockets
Money on my tables, spend it with my partner
Louis V goggles, YSL belt, new Gucci loafers, Turn't to the death
Tied up with money, not time for beef
Looking' for yo girl, on my tour bus asleep
On her knees sucking' dick like a pro
I love dolla signs, you in love with a ho
Err'thang that Juicy got cut my bro half like Dewey Cox
Fuck 12 and the jury box
Nigga, look at my jewelry box
I got diamond shine, my chain got 'em stuey rocks
I'mma turn this camera on and she go script like movie plots
All this cash, talk is cheap, if ye ain't talkin' money
Don't talk to me!
20 years payed, bitch, I'm made
Game on lock like I lost the key
