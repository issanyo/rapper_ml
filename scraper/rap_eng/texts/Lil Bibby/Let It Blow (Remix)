[Hook: Cuban Da Savage]
Pull up on yo block, we gon' let it blow
We don't talk to snitches, we don't fuck with hoes
You fake ass rappers 'bout to get exposed
I just seen't your mama at the corner store
Pull up on yo block, we gon' let it blow
We don't talk to snitches, we don't fuck with hoes
You fake ass rappers 'bout to get exposed
I just seen't your mama at the corner store

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
I said my shooters cost a grip, twelve fifty for the kicks
Fifty in my pants, that ho thought I was on bricks
Tell homie pipe down, I know he not with the shits
We gon' blow him right down then skeet off in the whip
Like Andre, we drummin', got the drums in the clip
Niggas seen how we comin', now they youngins wanna flip
I don't want your mixtape, I treat it like a frisbee
You ain't certified, all that talking you can miss me
Shooters outside, couple shooters in here with me
I'm slapped off the Henny, call bro to come and get me
Pull up in your hood in a Bentley, I'm gangster
My youngin take your chain then thank ya
I'm with G-Money, call it drank up
You broke, get your bank up
I know that bitch popped without that makeup
[?] in the cut rollin' stank up
Molly on stage droppin' rakes on that gang stuff
Get a goofy flamed up

[Hook: Cuban Da Savage]
Pull up on yo block, we gon' let it blow
We don't talk to snitches, we don't fuck with hoes
You fake ass rappers 'bout to get exposed
I just seen't your mama at the corner store
Pull up on yo block, we gon' let it blow
We don't talk to snitches, we don't fuck with hoes
You fake ass rappers 'bout to get exposed
I just seen't your mama at the corner store

[Verse 2: Cuban Da Savage]
Look bitch, you a dirty ass trick
Always got yo hand out
I'm Cuban Doll, I stand out
That's why I brought my mans out
Cause I got them bands now
Cause we in a Benz now
Break it down, smoke a pound
It's a damn shame how they change for the fame
Fuck a name, I'm in the game, I make it rain
You's a lame, I pull a stain
You ain't gang, you need a pass to hang
'Fore I snatch yo chain
Murk your ass and catch a plane
Cuban Savage, I'm insane
I don't do no talkin' bitch
'Cuase there ain't nothin' to talk about
Pull up to the murder scene this bitch wanna talk it out
I'ma pull that chopper out, bullets make 'em walk it out
Now this bitch forgot about, that gangster shit you not about

[Hook: Cuban Da Savage]
Pull up on yo block, we gon' let it blow
We don't talk to snitches, we don't fuck with hoes
You fake ass rappers 'bout to get exposed
I just seen't your mama at the corner store
Pull up on yo block, we gon' let it blow
We don't talk to snitches, we don't fuck with hoes
You fake ass rappers 'bout to get exposed
I just seen't your mama at the corner store

[Verse 3: Molly Brazy]
Fuck the opposite and fuck 12, man they ain't stoppin' shit
Hoes dick biting, if I had one, you'd be toppin' it
I'm droppin' shit
Yeah my name is Molly, I ain't poppin' it
Four of the Hi-Tech in the Fanta, swear I'm high as shit
All these bitches lyin', talking 'bout they takin' trips
Rob your ho out the stick then I put forty in your bitch
I won't miss, like I'm swiping, nigga all my pieces hitting
I'll never trust a goofy, all you bitches counterfeit
I don't know why these bitches hate me, I don't never hate
Slide down your block with the K and they bitches elevate
Say they put money on my head
Well get it back bitch, I ain't dead
Yeah bitch that's what I said
Free my brother, fuck the feds

[Hook: Cuban Da Savage]
Pull up on yo block, we gon' let it blow
We don't talk to snitches, we don't fuck with hoes
You fake ass rappers 'bout to get exposed
I just seen't your mama at the corner store
Pull up on yo block, we gon' let it blow
We don't talk to snitches, we don't fuck with hoes
You fake ass rappers 'bout to get exposed
