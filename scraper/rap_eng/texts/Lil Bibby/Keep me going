[Verse 3: Lil Bibby]
The money ain't keep me going
If I go broke then I kick a door in
Ain't wifing these bitches they too annoying
Ain't want that fight and my niggas blowin'
We in Chiraq with the heat got free crack on repeat
Strapped for the beef got the MAC on the seat
They snitchin' there's too many rats in the street
I used to be nice man what happened to me
Homicides murders I done seen it
Homies died turned me to a demon
Niggas dissin I know they don't mean it
Head shot  to see what he was thinking
Let out fifty shots without blinking
Kill a witness I ain't with the singing
Caught him lacking noddin' of leanin'
Close range now I gotta clean it
Got me a hundred clip
Back with the rubber grip
I be on other shit
Bibby on sucka shit
I do not trust a bitch
Real niggas fuck with this
Fuck an imposter
MCDonalds you lovin' it
Kissin' it lickin' it wifin' it cuffin' it
Little do he know my hoes [?]
We [?] keepin' it right after we done with it
Now you can beat a [?] I wassup with it
