[Hook]
Shit ain't been the same since I came up
We some savages, that's what the hood made us
Bodies droppin' everyday, they try to blame us (hannh)
I said, that's just how I was raised up
Bunch of young niggas and we dangerous
Wild niggas (wild niggas), can't tame us (can't tame us)
It's kill or be killed where I came from (hannh)
I said, that's just how I was raised up

[Verse 1]
Real street nigga, I can't change up
Your favorite rappers' stories be all made up (Lie)
Niggas hate me, try to fuck my name up (they hate me)
Bro's shootin', I was trappin get my change up
Lil Bibby, yea I get it for the low
Turn a quarter to a half to a whole to a deuce to a fo'
Got my grams up, I'm sellin them O's
All that shit I done sold, waste cash on clothes
Chase back, fuck hoes, go broke, kick doors
Sip lean, smoke dro, mask up, shoot poles
Hit 'em up, flee the scene
Late night wit the beam
You would prolly go crazy if you done seen what I seen

[Verse 2]
I got hittas, nigga, I ain't talkin' baseball (yup)
My youngest run up on you, shoot ya face off
Tryna wipe them niggas out like Adolf
Cops grab me I ain't seen nothing, Ray Charles
I ain't average nigga
I'm a savage nigga
Where da cake at? You know I gotta have it nigga
Fuck these rappin' niggas, I'll smack a nigga
Fuck these haters, I'll just stunt and make 'em madder nigga
Gettin' money trappin' rain, snow or sunny
And my bitch Nina pretty, let her off if it get ugly
Niggas fakin' like they for me
Bitches talkin' like they love me
I don't let that lil shit bug me
I'm just gettin' to the money (hannh)
