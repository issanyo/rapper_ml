[Hook: G Herbo]
They say Herbo don't come around no more, I wonder why
Maybe I'm just tired of having the iron everywhere I ride around
I got so tired of nickel and diming and seeing my mama crying
So sick and tired of niggas that ain't got nothing, want some of mine
No I ain't broke no more, I ran it up, I'm tired of lying
Gotta hide the Mac, can't worry about niggas no more, I'm tired of trying
I be on the grind, I don't get no sleep so all the time I'm tired
Hope it pay off, mama said she tired of wondering if I'm alive

[Verse 1: G Herbo]
Hope it all pay off, mama said she tired of wondering if I'm alive
See my face pop up on Channel 5, talking about a homicide
He was caught laid out on Essex Ave gunned down a bunch of times
No gun on me so that means I lied in all them fucking rhymes
I ain't tryna go out like that, how the whole city run they mouth like that
Got a .40 cocked back, hollow tip magazine, yeah I leave out the house like that
Gotta stay lowkey, I ain't been off lean but I'm ready to bounce right back
Getting tired of everybody putting stress on me, fuck around and relapse right back
I got so tired of nickel and diming and seeing my mama crying
Tired of being around my homies dying, seen too many homicides
Kobe's last breath was right before my eyes, shit had me traumatized
I'm so sick and tired of being tired, I don't even exercise

[Hook: G Herbo]
They say Herbo don't come around no more, I wonder why
Maybe I'm just tired of having the iron everywhere I ride around
I got so tired of nickel and diming and seeing my mama crying
So sick and tired of niggas that ain't got nothing, want some of mine
No I ain't broke no more, I ran it up, I'm tired of lying
Gotta hide the Mac, can't worry about niggas no more, I'm tired of trying
I be on the grind, I don't get no sleep so all the time I'm tired
Hope it pay off, mama said she tired of wondering if I'm alive

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
I tote me a big .45, I'm tired of eights, I'm tired of nines
Niggas got my name in they mouth, guess they ain't never gonna get tired of dying
I'm tired of trying, I'm tired of flying, I'm tired of niggas lying
Bout to move down south, cop a big ass house, I need some peace and quiet
I was always silent, grew up violent, adapted to my climate
Fly as a pilot, please come try it, I stay with my sidekick
I already cocked back, pussy nigga top back, put a bullet hole in your Sox cap
Niggas wanna start rumors like I ain't got shooters, tell 'em hating ass niggas stop that
I know real drug lords and I really fought war why the hell you think I bought these guns for?
40 Glock with the beam, pull up on the scene, I make all the niggas run for it
See me out in the town, got at least 30,000, so them hating ass niggas come for it
I ain't worried about the bread, put a hundred on your head, make all my lil niggas hunt for him

[Hook: G Herbo]
They say Herbo don't come around no more, I wonder why
Maybe I'm just tired of having the iron everywhere I ride around
I got so tired of nickel and diming and seeing my mama crying
So sick and tired of niggas that ain't got nothing, want some of mine
No I ain't broke no more, I ran it up, I'm tired of lying
Gotta hide the Mac, can't worry about niggas no more, I'm tired of trying
I be on the grind, I don't get no sleep so all the time I'm tired
Hope it pay off, mama said she tired of wondering if I'm alive

[Outro: Lil Bibby]
I said if you wanna get ahead sometimes you gotta go with doubt you feel me? You have to make a lot of sacrifices for this shit man, you know what I'm saying? A wise man once told me, he said Bibby you want something you never had, you gotta do something you ain't never did. You feel me? He said Bibby you having too much fun, you know what I'm saying? It's grind time man and I like niggas to be on my ass sometimes man. Look, push me, they push me to go harder, you know what I'm saying?
