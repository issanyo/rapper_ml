[Verse 1: Matt B]
Stacks on stacks
All on my Ferrari seats
Racks on racks
Don't sit on my Ferrari seats
In the grove, through the hills
We be 'bout that guap life
Change of pace, watch it splash
Be on my Steph Curry all for you
Shooting like Steph Curry all for you
ATL, Paris, France
You wined and dined, we fucking now
Satin sheets, ocean views (ocean views)
All for you, I do it all for you

[Pre-Chorus: Matt B]
'Cause you be so committed (smokin' on that gas)
When I'm with you I'm lifted (tweakin' off that gas)
It was you I'm missing
Yeah it was you I'm missing

[Chorus: Matt B]
My life is like a movie
Let's do this like the movies
Life is like a movie
Let's do this like the movies


[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
Now shawty just wanna come chill with the boys
She saw me hop out of that Lam' with the doors
Like you the young nigga that's making the noise
I saw you last week, you was whipping the Porsche
Balmain, Givenchy, I'm dripping of course
Don't run up on me, I'm gripping the torch
Last nigga tried me got hooked up to IVs
And quit the gangbanging, got hooked on the Lord
Yeah, she say that I'm handsome
She just wanna stay in my mansion
She just wanna lay by the pool
Go on IG and just play in my jewels
I'm M.O.B. and I play by the rules
You got a man, girl just stay with your dude
And look, I'm not tryna be rude
The door is that way shawty, go get your shoes
I'm too young to look for a wifey
I need that check just like Nike
I'm flexing, these haters don't like me
I need the money, these hoes don't excite me
She know I got too many groupies
Go get the camera, I look like a movie
Tony Montana, I die with my hammer
I'm chasing that paper until they come shoot me

[Chorus: Matt B]
My life is like a movie
Let's do this like the movies
Life is like a movie
Let's do this like the movies

[Verse 3: Matt B]
I am so famous now
They like me 'cause I'm famous now
I am so famous now
Told them hoes beat it bitch
I ain't tryna fuck with you
Designer brands, double tap
Trolling hard on Instagram ain’t you
Trolling hard on Instagram ain’t you
Let me work, she a fiend
My stroke game be like Michael Phelps
All this sauce, shopping sprees
Flexing be so strong when I'm with you
Flexing be so strong when I'm with you
Flexing be so strong

[Pre-Chorus: Matt B]
'Cause you be so committed (smokin' on that gas)
When I'm with you I'm lifted (tweakin' off that gas)
It was you I'm missing
Yeah it was you I'm missing

[Chorus: Matt B]
My life is like a movie
Let's do this like the movies
Life is like a movie
Let's do this like the movies

[Outro: Matt B]
Life be like the movies, movies
Life be like the movies
Life be like the movies, movies
Life be like the movies
Life is like the movies
Let's do this like the movies
I am so famous now
They like me 'cause I'm famous now
I am so famous now
