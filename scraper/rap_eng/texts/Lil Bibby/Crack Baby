[Intro]
KidWond3r you made this beat yeah
Yeah
This is real shit you know
I said I won't talk about it, fuck it
I'm talking about it, I'm talking about it
Look

[Verse]
I saw my mama smokin' crack right in my face and left me traumatized
She was never sober, I can tell when I look in her eyes
Nigga been through hard times
Shootouts that I wish I died
I know about them stomach aches
That pain that hurt to be alive
I was lost up in them streets
I had to sell them drugs to eat
Them hoes ain't wanna fuck with me
I had to put j's on my feet
They kno' I had that curly hair
I know I'm lookin' like I'm sweet
I want that boy to disrespect
I never got my ass beat
I had too much pain in me
My life make me angry
If you come from the bottom
Ain't no difference you the same as me
Niggas said they fuck with me
I had to take some time to think
You sold my moma crack and took her link
I ain't have shit to drink
We ate that chili out the can
I had to turn into a man
I was sellin' Reggie nigga
Started out with seven grams
Never had no helpin' hand
One sister and two brother's
I got love for white Shawn
He one crazy motherfucker
I made millions out the trenches
I'm one wavy motherfucker
I know that's a lot of guap for a crack baby motherfucker
Felt like life was just abusing him
We don't post our guns on IG
Cause we be usin' 'em
They like I went to school with him
I ain't have no father figure
Had to go way harder than him
Had to play way smarter than him
Them fucked up nights what sparked him
I'm just glad to be alive
Look my nephew in his eyes
Saw the innocence
I told him that I love him like he mine
That's the type of shit that make you get out here and grind
And for that boy I'm killin' shit
I swear I do that time
Put my life all on the line
I was standin' on that nine
I was three foot to my brother
Fucked it up went two for five
I saw project on that bed
My lil cous lost his leg
I was Chillin' when I got that call
My cous was out that bed
After all them tears I shed
Got a gangster out here prayin'
Some old niggas bout to die behind this shit and I ain't playin'
Fuck the police and the feds
You heard what the fuck I said
Then lil niggas out here Hidin'
Fuck it I'm gon' play they plan
We gon' fill that boy with lead
Fuck that shit I want his head
They got my cousin too much meds
I got some killas I keep em fed
All this cheese bring the rats
That's the reason for the gat
And that beam is attached
It's in on me like a tat
I love green, I need racks
Get my team up out the trap
If he seen all the shit I seen
He'll probably snap
Say I keep that, 40 on me
Like a I.D, that's high key
Bullet in the head right beside me
Come try me
Back and forth, the dissin'
I won't do it cus that's not me
The last nigga dissed the gang
This brains was all sloppy
I say damn he comin' home
I call the cash with glow
I don't buy the jewellery no more
Man that shit is old
I just bought two home
In the burbs and then it go
I came a long way, I use to post up by that store
Yeah
