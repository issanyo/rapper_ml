[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Bitch you know I'm bout that action
I be rappin’ I be trappin
Overseas makin’ G’s with my youngin’s causin’ havoc
For that money I’m an addict, where’s it at? I gotta have it
Get that work through the mail we just wrap it up and pass it
I'm bout my dividends
Lightin' blue benjamins
Nigga you know I'ma stack it
Cut out the middle man
Ride with my little friend
Nigga you know what'll happen
They say I look like I'm innocent
Word on the street, nigga know I'm a savage
Niggas be doin' that yappin'
But really they don't want the static

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
May the Lord be my witness
When it come to money
I still get it out the trenches, ay
Yeah, we ain't beefin' bout no bitches
I'm a boss about my business
I still get it out the trenches, ay
Yeah, I get it out the trenches
When it come to money
I still get it out the trenches, ay
Yeah, we ain't beefin' bout no bitches
You get murk'd about the bitches
I still get it out the trenches, ay

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Straight out the trench
Uber robbers hop out a Bentley
Yeah-yeah, multi faced fetti
You a stain, really-really-really
Dealers, scammers, and the killers
Went back in, I'ma run over, get a miss
AP hit like AB
And that bitch cost bout a billion
And they know that I'm always bout a B
And my block ain't raise no hoes
With DJ Bandz (?)
(?) my bang bros
40 Glock bitch, I bang those
Roll out west then I trade those
Cool nigga, don't be no fool nigga
See me? I just lay low
Kids gon' grow when I say so
Bitch I'm gang

[Hook: Lil Bibby]

You get murk'd about the bitches
