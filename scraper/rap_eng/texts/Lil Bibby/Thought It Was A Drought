[Verse 1]
I said I came from the mud and I'm really tired of tellin' them
That lean had me stuck, so I had to quit the medicine
I post up on the block, I had seven for the dub
Swear I had this shit on lock, 'cause my brother was the plug
And these strippers mad, I won't throw no money in the club
I got youngins doin' bids, every month I show 'em love
I got hitters like the Cubs, and the killas is my cuz'
I can't trust none of these niggas, if you with me then they blood
Let me tell you how it was, trappin' in the trenches
Your nosey ass granny, tell that bitch to mind her business
My lil brother grippin', you want that smoke I send 'em
I say all my niggas hungry yeah you lookin' just like dinner
Straight from the 'go
Feds kick in the door
Bussin' the pole all my niggas get low
Show me the cash, I give it and go
I don't got a vest on, real niggas they know
I'm screaming "No Limit" and that's to the grave
I work like a slave, I got to get paid
24 hours I'm on serving J's
No matter to me that shit got to get made
I'm shippin' em out, that means there's never a drought
I heard you been runnin' your mouth
These bitches is out, I know they here for the clout
I just put dick in they mouth
You holding like niggas won't enter your house
You want some free smoke 'cuz I'm giving it out
I get you murked for a little amount
I do my dirt and go live in the south

[Hook]
When that new shit comin' out?
Yeah they thought it was a drought
I get that work ain't running out
Yeah they thought it was a drought
Yeah they thought it was a drought
Said they thought it was drought
It ain't no real niggas out, so they though it was a drought
When that new shit comin' out?
Yeah they thought it was a drought
I get that work ain't running out
Yeah they thought it was a drought
Yeah they thought it was a drought
Said they thought it was drought
It ain't no real niggas out, so they thought it was a drought

[Verse 2]
They like "Bibby where you been?"
I've been huntin' for the cash
All these niggas chase some bitches but I rather chase a bag
Forty make my pants sag
Balmain's on my ass
All these ho's disappear when niggas down 'till they last
But I'm up, bitches wanna fuck, keep on hittin' me up
Got her ass, and she bad, but to me that's not enough
I just use her for a nut, really I know she a slut
I just hit 'er, then I send her to that brewfurd, he could cuff
They say we gon' go to hell, smoking out the bale
Me and Will, 'till my lungs fail
Jewish lawyers, so I dodged jail
Youngest 'bout that murder, gotta put on for the squad bail
Took a lot of losses 'till I click up with the cartel

[Hook]
When that new shit comin' out?
Yeah they thought it was a drought
I get that work ain't running out
Yeah they thought it was a drought
Yeah they thought it was a drought
Said they thought it was drought
It ain't no real niggas out, so they though it was a drought
When that new shit comin' out?
Yeah they thought it was a drought
I get that work ain't running out
Yeah they thought it was a drought
Yeah they thought it was a drought
Said they thought it was drought
It ain't no real niggas out, so they thought it was a drought, aye
