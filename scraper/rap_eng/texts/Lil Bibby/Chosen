[Intro: PnB Rock]
Yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: PnB Rock]
I ain't ask to live this life, bitch I was chosen
Put some diamonds round my neck, now my shit frozen
I could sing to your bitch and she be open
And I can buy what I want, my pockets swollen
Ballin', I'm ballin' for real, ballin', I'm ballin' for real
Ballin', I'm ballin' for real, ballin', I'm ballin' for real
I ain't ask to live this life, bitch I was chosen
And I can buy what I want, my pockets swollen

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
Ballin', I'm ballin' for real
Drinkin' this lean by the seal
Fuckin' this bitch off a pill
I'm lovin' the way that she feels
I signed my own self to a deal
New lane, this shit's so unreal
They hatin' but they better chill
This .40, it can't be concealed
Nobody gave me a loan
I did it all on my own
Remember I ain't have a home
Now bitch I got me two homes
I did it all by myself
Bitch don't be countin' my wealth
No cosigns, no help
Now it's Goyard on the belt
Chanel drippin' on my sneakers
Margielas on my sneakers
Last year it was free for a feature
Now it's 10k for a feature
Chanel drippin' on my sneakers
Margielas on my sneakers
Last year it was free
For a feature
Now it's 10k for a feature

[Hook: PnB Rock]
I ain't ask to live this life, bitch I was chosen
Put some diamonds round my neck, now my shit frozen
I could sing to your bitch and she be open
And I can buy what I want, my pockets swollen
Ballin', I'm ballin' for real, ballin', I'm ballin' for real
Ballin', I'm ballin' for real, ballin', I'm ballin' for real
I ain't ask to live this life, bitch I was chosen
And I can buy what I want, my pockets swollen

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
Say this for my sisters, my brothers
Y'all niggas straight out the gutter
Remember we didn't have nothin'
And now I can buy everything that I wanted
Bibby, I'm not with the stuntin'
These bitches know that I got it
I just might walk in the store
See it, I like it, you know that I cop it
Ballin', I'm ballin' for real
All of that hatin', it might get you killed
Pardon my brother, he ain't got no chill
He been that way ever since we was little
Straight from the block, I'm with PnB Rock
We was lettin' off shots, we was runnin' from cops
Out in the field we was lookin' for ops
Now we at the dealership lookin' for drops
Niggas don't know how it feel
I slept with rats in the crib
Now I got three different homes
I don't know where I'ma live
I'm tryna cop me that Wraith
They don't want no beef cause it's too much at stake
Niggas be broke, that's the reason they hate
Flippin' them burgers for minimum wage, aye

[Hook: PnB Rock]
I ain't ask to live this life, bitch I was chosen

And I can buy what I want, my pockets swollen
Ballin', I'm ballin' for real, ballin', I'm ballin' for real
Ballin', I'm ballin' for real, ballin', I'm ballin' for real
I ain't ask to live this life, bitch I was chosen
And I can buy what I want, my pockets swollen
