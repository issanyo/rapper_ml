[Chorus: Lil Herb & Lil Bibby]
Niggas know we next up
Niggas know we next up

Bitch, I said I'm next up

Hell yeah, we next up
Niggas know we next up

Next up, next up
Next up, next up
Next up, next up, next up
Niggas know we
Next up, next up
Next up, next up
Next up, next up
Next! niggas know

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Bitch, I'm next, I'm way better than the rest
Only 17, but I'm flowing like a vet
MVP so you know that I'm the best
And I never had shit so you know I'm gon' flex
I'm next, believe that
A blind man can even see that
Killing tracks, no feedback
Save yo comments I don't need that
Niggas getting mad, you was here first?
I don't give a fuck
Niggas gettin' cut
These niggas suck
Bibby taking off tell 'em eat my dust(eat my dust)
Smoking loud me and Herbo
I think I'm finna hit the turbo
Im in another class cuz they learn slow
I need brain so I'm looking for a nerd ho
And I'm getting head while I'm riding
Boss shit
He's killin' everything I think he lost it
So cold that a nigga got frostbit
Had to go hard they said I lost it
Put this fucking beat in a coffin
Now these labels keep callin'
I need enough money for my whole team to be balling
If you don't like how I'm talking, get lost then
Young nigga with a check
Michael Jordan won it first
Shit ill be next
Best draft class yet XXL Freshman 2014
How the fuck yall ain't know I was the best
How the fuck yall ain't see that I was better than the rest
The boy too raw got niggas upset
Ima let yall ball, but my team got next

[Chorus: Lil Herb & Lil Bibby]
Niggas know we next up
Niggas know we next up
Niggas know we next up
Bitch, I said I'm next up
Niggas know we next up
Hell yeah, we next up
Niggas know we next up
Niggas know we
Next up, next up
Next up, next up
Next up, next up, next up
Niggas know we
Next up, next up
Next up, next up
Next up, next up
Next! niggas know

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Fuck next up I took off a while back
And all I ever do is fuck bitches and count stacks
Yea I spazz, I just run through them digits and bounce back
Niggas mad, pillow talking to bitches about rap
I ain't tripping, i'm just tryna get the check
Get my moms out the hood and throw something to the set
Everybody know I'm good when I'm out here in the hood
Plus I wish a nigga would and I'll open in his chest
If a nigga think he could then I think a nigga should
Got my young niggas tottin', they'll smoke em like a wood
And we willing to explain even though it's understood
Riding tinted in the rain, 30 shots under the hood
Everybody know my name cause they know ima be good
Yeah, it's straight
And I came from the bottom of the line
This a young nigga that done got up on the grind
Posted with them young niggas that be out here on the nine
And I'm totting guns nigga when i'm out here on the nine
Cause a lotta niggas mad that my squad up next
Since they acting hard, I bought my squad all techs
Pull up in them cars my squad all flex
Riding in the cars get us some of the broads
Send a nigga up to God forget about it tomorrow
I ain't ever hear shit, tryna get rich, fuck a bitch
She can't ever give me shit unless she tryna suck a dick
I ain't ever wife a bitch, I'd rather bite a brick
He be worrying bout a bitch, she be out here tryna trick
But you won't get me
You want Lil' Herb
Bet it won't be free
You signed 2 cats, bet it won't be 3
Its NLMB
My niggas up next and there ain't no room
You don't get my respect cuz you ain't no goon
Everybody just relax 'til my tape come soon
