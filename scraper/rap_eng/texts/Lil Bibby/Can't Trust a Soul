[Intro]
Huh, I say we back on that other shit
Squad shit, that gang shit
Huh, look, check

[Verse 1]
I feel like a God or a king
In the Chi bet you ride with them things
See an opp then we makin' a scene
Hundred shot, put your block on the screen
You an opp if you not with the team
I just went copped a few Glocks with the beams
I just talked to 2Pac in a dream
Told me "keep grindin', keep doin' your thing"
Back in this bitch, I got weight on my shoulders
Bitch I'm No Limit, don't play with my soldiers
Check my truck, I got the k, and some groceries
If I catch an opp then I'm fuckin' him over
Don't fuck with witness unless they Jehovah
We want your block, we gone take this shit over
Young nigga get off the weight like I'm Oprah

[Bridge]
They callin' me Bibby The Great
I just might pull on your block in a Wraith
I hang with the lions and apes
Dressed up in Bape, pipes on our waist

[Verse 2]
I get the drop where he stay
Come in your house for the safe
Send all your shooters my way
I go Tony Montana no scar on my face
Only thing that I could trust is my llama
Bitch I don't even put trust in my momma
I'm public enemy like I'm Osama
Worthless lil nigga, pops shoulda wore a condom
All my niggas, they back on that nonsense
I get you jacked for your profits
I get you whacked with no problem
Cause a savage can't handle my conscious

[Hook]
Ohhhh, ohhhh
I can't trust a soul, I can't trust a soul, oh no
I can't trust a bitch, I can't trust a soul, oh no
I can't trust a soul, I can't trust a soul, oh-oh-oh
Niggas plottin', yeah they want me gone, they want me gone
I can't trust a soul, I can't trust a soul, oh no
I can't trust these niggas, I can't trust these hoes
I can't trust a soul, I can't trust a soul, oh no

[Verse 3]
VVS on my chest, my heart cold as ice
Hear that voice in my head, call it Poltergeist
You a bitch like your girl, man y'all both alike
If the cops pull me over, I know the rights
Like you think you tough cause you on the pipe
Sneak diss again now they stole your life
Please do not tote the pipe, you ain't gonna blow the pipe
Show your rights, show your rights, show your rights
Hollow tips all in the sig
I might have to smoke me a pig
Coppers been killin' them kids
I swear that this shit gettin serious
So please do not play with my niggas
I went to the store, bought some K's for my niggas
I make sure everything straight for my niggas
If money get low, rob a bank with my niggas

[Hook]
Ohhhh, ohhhh
I can't trust a soul, I can't trust a soul, oh no
I can't trust a bitch, I can't trust a soul, oh no
I can't trust a soul, I can't trust a soul, oh-oh-oh
Niggas plottin', yeah they want me gone, they want me gone
I can't trust a soul, I can't trust a soul, oh no
I can't trust these niggas, I can't trust these hoes
I can't trust a soul, I can't trust a soul, oh no

[Outro]
I said I'm back bitch, you hear what the fuck I'm sayin'? I said I'm fuckin' back, you know how I fuckin' rock man. Boss gang, boss gang shit, ya hear? Ayy
