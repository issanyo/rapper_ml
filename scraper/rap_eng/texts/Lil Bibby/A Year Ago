[Hook: Lil Bibby]
Just a year ago I was stuck off in a slump
I was broke, I ain't have nothin
I came from the bottom that's why I stunt
That's why I stunt, that's why I stunt
Might go broke, ion give a fuck
Pop a pill, that turn a nigga up
Catch me in the club might throw a few bucks
See me in the streets, niggas know what's up
Still throwin my set, that's where I'm from
I ain't worried bout nun, rollin up the blunt
Shittin on niggas that's why I stunt, that's why I stunt
That's why I stunt,and my momma ain't gotta worry bout nun
Ain't got ask no bitch for no money, used to be hungry now I stunt

[Verse 1: Lil Herb]
You might catch me in the club counting nothing but one hunneds
Juvenile with cash money, I'm the number 1 stunta
Foreign whips all summer, ridin tinted, gettin blunted
And they all different colors, so you never see me comin
And the reason I be stuntin, is cuz I'm used to havin nothing
Schooling housing by the public, now them thousands ain't a subject
I put money first, trapping all summer call it sunny work
Went from rags to riches pullin bitches with a bummy shirt
Now the city sayin I'm the man in the streets
Going hard for the squad, throwing bands in the streets
I might go broke, but you know just how that go
If I go broke then a nigga getting poked
Nigga don't go then a nigga gettin smoked
Watch I get ghost, like a nigga didn't blow
Make the police think a nigga didn't know, like a nigga didn't know
Fuck the po po, if I had Court then a nigga didn't go
Had to see a PO, then a nigga didn't show
750 cost ten like I'm in a 6 4
I ain't trippin on a ho I'm too busy gettin dough
Same nigga by the sto, posted up, me and bro
Just roll up the dope, thinking bout a year ago

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Winter time I super grind, summer time we stay awake
I'm up early, whipping up the pies like Aunt Shirley
Rollin the loud make the blunt pearly, catch me on the 8 ?
Fuck the jakes, you get stretched for the cake
Bitches know the deal we can't chase erday, we just sex we don't date
Skeet her chest and her face, I flex on them hoes
Fuck like twice then I next on them hoes
Only want a night worth of sex from them hoes
Don't wanna FaceTime or chat with them hoes
I'm sprinting to them stacks, imma hit you right back
Trap full of white made (?) look black
Pull up in that thang with the ceiling pushed back
Riding by myself, but if you pull up on the side you can look at this mac
Remember I used to look at them niggas way back
Remember I used to rock the huaraches with the strap
Remember I didn't know how to fill a kinda stack
But now I'm that nigga and all I do is count em back
Yeah, and that's why I stunt
I ain't worried bout nun I do what I want
I ain't gotta trick on bitches cuz they wanna fuck
I'm just chillin countin digits, and I'm smokin blunts, c money rollin up
And if we pull up on a nigga then he betta duck
Cuz we got hollows in the semi you gone need some luck
My shooters on it, they ain't stopping till they see him drop
Cuz when a nigga kill yo homie you don't give a fuck
In the field for my homies we gone send it up
I'm off a hitta for Roc
R.I.P. free my niggas off the Remy's and Jocs
Used to ridin hot cars, now my shit off the lot
Just to sit on the block
