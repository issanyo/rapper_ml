[Hook]
I ain't been getting no sleep
She be on it
They ain't got nothing on me
I be on it
Real nigga, yeah that's me now
So you know I brought the whole team out now
Cash rules all about the cream
I be on it all night
I be on it all night
I be on it all night
I be on it all night
I be on it all night
I be on it all night
I be on it all night
I be on it all night

[Verse 1]
5 a.m counting dough in the kitchen
Wanna roll with a nigga cause she know I'm that nigga
Ball so hard in the hole like Griffin
And I might be ugly, but my hoes ain't trippin'
I'm just chasing commas, I'm just stacking all my riches
Pounds in the trash can, Bibby do the dishes
Chain look sickening, watch look ridiculous
Walk in red bottoms like my shoes on they period
Yeah I know you feeling it
Yeah I be killing it
The work I was dealing it and my plug he was shipping it
Chasing that check, hold up I'll be right back
I be on it all night, nigga sleep what's that?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I be on it, yeah I be on it
You ain't with the squad then you prolly my opponent
Luke told me get em fuck around get a bonus
Nigga what you think imma do? Slaughter my opponent
Homie where the cash at? Yeah I got to have that
If money getting low I found out where yo stash at
Cuffin' these hoes man that's where you went bad at
You probably get laughed at cause everybody smashed that
In the Benz truck tryna stack my M's up
Billion dollar dreams fuck I need a friend for?
I just threw a couple grand up in Pin Ups
Own it all night, yeah I gotta get my ends up

[Hook]
