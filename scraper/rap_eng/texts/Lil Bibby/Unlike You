Real rap real shit this is not no drill shit
Only speak what i live bitch
White Shawn goin kill shit
I was out in that field bitch, bout to come up real quick
I dont fuck with no fake niggas only niggas i eat meals with
My bitch nina i chill with, real niggas goin feel this
I dont hang with a lot of niggas cause that hating shit i can't deal with
While you was wasting yo time, i was out on my grind
Every pennie nickel and dime, i put everything on the line
I be painting pictures for the blind
Just talk about my life and make all that shit rhyme
Young nigga im winning and i came from behind
Step up to that thrown
Yeah im here to claim whats mine, nigga ima count to 5 ha


I got money all on my mind
Bitches all on my line
I got shit i wanna buy, i can't give a bitch my time to the top i climb
Made a couple mistakes i wish i could press rewind
Smoking on that loud, just to clear my mind
I be putting in work, i be putting in time
Bibby im that nigga all these labels wanna sign
They wanna see me fall, they dont wanna see me shine
They bitch know im a star, so she give me top while i drive
I call it giving me mind, thick bitch she threw it back
I call that shit rewind, young nigga got one mission
Ima get this money ima fuck bitches
Liddo niggas guna talk down but they know they really can't fuck with us
