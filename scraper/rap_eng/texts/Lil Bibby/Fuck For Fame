[Hook: Lil Durk]
All these bitches wanna fuck for fame
All these niggas take to build their fame
A nigga like me, I can fuck off my name
Where I'm from, I can really fuck off my name

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Ain't shit change, I can't change, I'm turned up
They be fuckin' hoes gettin' labels on my bumper
Red bottom bleedin' like I walked across a murder
I ain't feelin' shit, it ain't shit if you get murdered
Gon' and fuck me, I let the fame do it, consider yourself lucky
It's only one night shit, ain't no fuck again and again
OTF, no other end, ugly hoes, I want the opposite
A bad bitch, drop dead, poppin' bitch
Conceited bitch, every day she need the dick
My name Rigan Bells, she eat the dick

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
She gon' fuck for fame, big bucks, the name
Got the squad with me, bitch, fuck the gang
If that's yo main, that's in-fuckin'-sane
Bitch I'm Lil Bibby, I want nothin' but brain
Think she won't go, is you fuckin' insane?
Shorty on my dick, she ain't fuckin' with lames
Bibby in this bitch and he makin' it rain
Catch me throwin' hundreds, I ain't got no change
I do my thing, no I won't change
Don't feel no pain, stay in your lane
Say bitch I'm hot, and I can't stop
Me and Durk off mollies, yeah my face hot

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Boss Top]
All these bitches want a name off me
Bitches goin' crazy for Big Boss T
On that pregnant shit, bitch don't call me
Told that bitch get off me, get the fuck off me
Bands in my Robins, bitch I got my wings
Where I'm from, shorty, they're clappin' them things
She want to do the squad, let her chase her dream
You want to get to me, you gotta do my team
I only want the face, mama keep your jeans
Bitch I'm Boss Top and I keep shit straight
I only want the face, mama keep your jeans
Bitch I'm Boss Top and I keep shit straight
