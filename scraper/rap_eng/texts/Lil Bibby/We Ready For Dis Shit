[Hook: Lil Bibby]
Grab the choppas, tell broski load the clips
They say niggas want war and we ready for this shit
Broad day I ain't worry 'bout a snitch
They say niggas want war and we ready for this shit
Niggas want war and we ready for this shit
They say niggas want war and we ready for this shit
Want war and we ready for this shit
They say niggas want war and we ready for this shit

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Big bucks, I count stacks
Never slipping, I got that
This war shit, we 'bout that
Camping out where your house at
Don't fuck around, we wack clowns
Do a hit and come back around
What goes around comes back around
So I only calm down when that MAC around
Real shit, I kill shit
This Glock 9, I kill with
That fighting shit, don't got time
Got a .45 that I drill with
My nigga Reese money get 'em gone in a hurry
We stay with the 30
I ain't talking Stephen Curry
Get into it with my niggas
It's a fact that you'll die
Call me Bibby 2 9s
I'll be strapped with two 9's
Listen up, I'm finna go and hit 'em up
Broski load them clips on up
Broad day, don't give a fuck

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
Grab the choppas, tell broski load the clips

Niggas want war and we ready for this shit
They say niggas want war and we ready for this shit
Want war and we ready for this shit
They say niggas want war and we ready for this shit

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Grab the choppas, tell fo'nem load the clips
'Cause we'll let 'em rip if you run, don't slip
Rolling stupid thoinks when I'm down rolling lips
I got to stain on a nigga with some pounds meet me there
I'm somewhere in the air, 300 add to it
Lawless fools, feed my dogs
Yeah bitch we very ruthless
Sipping liquor cause we cool
Nail 'em with them tools
RIP [?}, cock it back and let it loose

[Hook: Lil Bibby]

[Verse 3: Lil Reese]
All my niggas done invented drill
Shawty come through and you will get killed
Be strapped up like a car seat
I play with Heat, call me D-Wade
I'm 2-4 plus 6 more
That's a 30 bitch, I'm gonna blow
Your hoe, she gonna go
Do the guys bitch let's go
Smoking on that loud shit
Tryna find a way to get the quick smell
Rob who? That's an easy kill
I'ma mask up 'cause they trick for real
OTF, fuck the opps
Only the family, this shit real
If you want war, you get killed
Broad day, you get drills

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
Grab the choppas, tell broski load the clips
