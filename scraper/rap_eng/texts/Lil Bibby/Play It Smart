[Intro]
Uh, its a million downfalls in this shit nigga
Just keep ya head up

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Listen homie, if you gotta go this way about it
Just be smart and know its a different way up out it
Put your game plan together and don't play about it
And when that shit get real just make your way up out it

[Hook: Jace and Lil Bibby]
Youngin' play ya part
Know your role
Guard ya heart
Stay away from them ratchet ass hoes and the narcs
If you gotta keep the wretched only show up when he spark
And if you riding in that whip keep that shit in yo department (skrrr!)

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
You wanna be a hustler wanna be a menace nigga?
Better listen from the start to the finish nigga
You see them clowns put they business on pictures nigga
Watch how they gone have a record like Guinness nigga
But listen though, fuck that other shit just get the dough
Stay to yourself and always treat the hoes like the hoes
Don't underestimate 'em treat the pros like the pros
It's some heavies in this game that took they fate to lames
Don't be out here chasing game just stay in your lane
Ain't no such thing as day ones cause niggas ain't the same
Don't ever fold when shit hit you gotta take the pain
And pay attention to who with you when that paper fade

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby]
Listen homie, if you gotta go this way about it
Just be smart and know its a different way up out it
Put your game plan together and don't play about it
And when that shit get real just make your way up out it

[Hook: Jace and Lil Bibby]
Youngin' play ya part
Know your role
Guard ya heart
Stay away from them ratchet ass hoes and the narcs
If you gotta keep the wretched only show up when he spark
And if you riding in that whip keep that shit in yo department (skrrr!)

[Verse 4: Jace]
Listen now, only roll yo pine in the crib
If they get you and yo niggas ain't no snitch up, do the bid
Hold it down, grow yo mind, do yo time, make it big
Play it safe, never wild, you got a fuckin' life to live
Get the Audi cause it's classic, get yo lady friend a Benz
Only smoke it if it's gas, you way to grown for mid
You gotta make something shake young nigga! Get it in
Only love her if you trust her but be cautious even then
Stay on top of all yo taxes, IRS they don't be playin'
Don't you ever make a move and let that money in yo head
Be good to all yo peoples, boss up, be a man
And if you ever need advice you can hit my line again!

[Verse 5: Lil Bibby]
Listen homie, if you gotta go this way about it
Just be smart and know its a different way up out it
Put your game plan together and don't play about it
And when that shit get real just make your way up out it


[Hook: Jace and Lil Bibby]
Youngin' play ya part
