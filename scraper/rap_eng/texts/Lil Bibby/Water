Said I gotta keep my head above water
I been goin' hard gotta go a lil harder
I been thinking smart gotta think a lil smarter
All I know is hustle, get that shit regardless
Said I gotta keep my head above water
Catch me in the kitchen I be whippin' with the water
Family over niggas, blood thicker than water
All I know is hustle, get that shit regardless

[Verse 1]
Real hustla, I'mma get that shit regardless
I will not starve bitch, work hard; my palms itch
I seen some garbage that fucked up my conscience
Niggas they talk shit but these niggas harmless
Im fresh up out that field, I swear this shit is real
Run up in the bank like Bump for the bills
Remember as a kid wasn't shit up in the fridge
Rob you for your ends I don't regret the shit I did
Made it out that struggle
Blame it on the hustle
Bet it all and doubled
Don't fuck with me then fuck you
Nigga, I don't trust you
Mama, girl, I love you
RIP my soldiers man I swear I do this for you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
In the kitchen I'm a chemist with the water I be whippin'
And these youngins they be snitchin'
If you start it Ima finish
Went hard from the begginin'
I think that I'm the realest
I'm tryna make a killin'
These hustlas gotta feel it
Hustlin's in my blood, money, cars, drugs
Post up with my thugs
Do this for the love
Nickels, dimes and dubs to the streets I lost my cuz
Feel like, I don't give a fuck
Sometimes I need a hug
But I'm all alone
Bibby stay strong
These niggas want me gone
I'm grippin' on that chrome
These bitches know I'm on
That's why they hit my phone
And I'm in my zone
Bitch just leave me 'lone
