[Intro: Lil Bibby]
Bibby frank, why they tried to rob her?
I got a job for you, meet me in the lobby

[Bridge: Lil Bibby]
Take my card
Trapspots, I got trapspots (I got trapspots)
Turn my momma house into a trapspot (to a trap, ay)
In my hood, shit like Black Ops (shit like Black Ops)
[Female]
(*oh my god, what is this? an L beat?*)

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
Look!
Shootouts in my hood, shit like Black Ops
Turn my momma house into a trapspot
Ay, trapspot, I got trapspots
Look, trapspot, I got trapspots
Look, Margiela all kinda flavors (Maison Margielas)
You ain't tryna fuck, bitch I'll see you later! (I'll see later!)
Ayy, look. Keep a Gat, that's a fact (that's a fact)
Ay, turn my momma house into a trap, ayy

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
You know I like a hood bitch, extra boujie
Took her from McDonalds, got that lil bitch eating sushi
Make her hold my toolie, we ain't going to no movies
Tell em even if you pay her, she ain't fucking with no goofy
Look, cooling with my pluggie sniffing raw (sniff that shit, ay)
Leaning with my shooters sipping raw, ayy
Lil shorty 19, I like her jaw. ay (I like her jaw)
Swear she swallow everything, man shorty raw. ay (she got a gift!)
My young-ins thirsty waiting on that call (on that call, ay)
I nod my head and they gon' knock ya off, ay (knock ya off, ay)
Shorty got an ass and it soft, look (and its soft, ay)
And she gon give her last to a boss, ay (to a boss)
On the e-way I'm just thinking about the past, how...
Living with my momma I was fucked up on my ass, how...
I was out of town, I made my momma sell my bags out
Bout to buy her that new whip, I know you like that Jag, ma
(get that whip, ay)

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
Shootouts in my hood, shit like Black Ops
Turn my momma house into a trapspot
Ay, trapspot, I got trapspots
Look, trapspot, I got trapspots
Look, Margiela all kinda flavors (kinda flavors)
You ain't tryna fuck, bitch I'll see you later! (later!)
Ayy, look. Keep a Gat, that's a fact (that's a fact)
Turn my momma house into a trap, ayy

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
(cookin') (cookin')
Cooking Ramen noodles out the crack pot
Tell me why I get harassed by the black cops
You could keep that, take my young-ins like them black Glocks
Goofy capping out the oneway, then he got shot
Niggas sending threats but never see it through
Riding through the night, they start shooting at my vehicle
My young-ins need some work don't make me put a key one you
Pull up with them sticks now candles lit
Man, R.I.P to you
