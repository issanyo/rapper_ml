[Verse 1: Baby E]
Trappin' getting old so I been movin' weight
Pigeons in the trunk I'm on the interstate
Made myself a plug get it 100 ways
And I still got the act you know I love the taste
Spending dirty money at the Gucci store
Fuckin' with the models eating sushi rolls
She think I'm a rapper get that groupie look
Baby-mama mad she seen me  movin' up
On to bigger better things on those television screens
I don't never get to sleep cause I'm so heavy in the streets
I just blew a hundred thousand and I'm goin' outta town
And I'ma try to make it back all right back

[Hook: Baby E]
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Sprite come home this year and we can't hardly wait
Deto in the feds and RC doin' state
Accepted consequences comin' with the game
Everybody kept it silent no one said a name
Sorry that I got you like Rich Homie, wait
What I meant to say was make you feel some type of way
I was jokin' one thing that I don’t get to do enough
I'm glad it make you mad that I be cuttin' up
On to bigger better things I been swervin', switchin' lanes
I don’t ever get to sleep, standin' tall while in the streets
Jumpin' bond three hundered thou' now I’m goin' outta town
Pray to God I make it all right back

[Hook: Baby E & Kevin Gates]
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby]
My plug just came through, brought me a jar of pills
Bout 10 pints of lean and a lot of kill'
I don’t waste my breath if you ain't talkin' bills
And if you spending stacks  then I'll come by yo' crib
And if you coppin' 3 then I'll  cut you a deal
I might pull up sir you know I got the steel
And I don’t buy no lean if it ain't got the seal
My homie got indicted so I'm bout to chill
I been fuckin' up these beats, couple grand to hear me speak
Ridin' heavy in the streets, got the Glock under the seat
My young nigga tote so you know a young nigga hold it

[Hook: Baby E &  Lil Bibby]
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
Finessin', finessin', I be finessin
