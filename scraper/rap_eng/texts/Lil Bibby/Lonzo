[Intro]
12 Hunna on the beat
DJ Flip, make the money flip

[Chorus]
I just wanna ball like I'm Lonzo
My accountant tried to tell me pay a car note
Fuck that bitch, I'ma cash out
12 Hunna on the beat, I'm 'bout to spaz out
Like 1200 on my feet, what's that Margiela?
Jumping out the foreign that's a sharp fella
All these bitches going, I ain't got to tell 'em
Put them P's right on the jet, I ain't got to mail 'em
I be throwing up my set, put my block first
I ain't thinking 'bout no bitch, I put my guap first
Shawty say she want some dick, I need the top first
It's gon' cost 'bout half a brick, you want a hot verse

[Verse]
I was just an alley kid, flipping on them mattresses
Now I fuck the baddest hoes, 'cause they know I'm havin' it
Been havin' swag when a young nigga was average
I just fuck her once and to my brother I be passing her
Damn, why your niggas broke, it look like they fasting
Damn, all my niggas lit, steady checking bags in
Used to tote a six shot trey five seven Magnum
Now I tote a fifty, run up on me I'ma bag 'em
And I keep it on me, niggas know me, you can ask 'em
And I'm out in Cali so you know it's going on, ayy
Need a hundred pack, and I only fuck with strongs, ayy
If that boy a brewfurd, I can't put him on my song, ayy

[Chorus]
I just wanna ball like I'm Lonzo
My accountant tried to tell me pay a car note
Fuck that bitch, I'ma cash out
12 Hunna on the beat, I'm 'bout to spaz out
Like 1200 on my feet, what's that Margiela?
Jumping out the foreign that's a sharp fella
All these bitches going, I ain't got to tell 'em
Put them P's right on the jet, I ain't got to mail 'em
I be throwing up my set, put my block first
I ain't thinking 'bout no bitch, I put my guap first
Shawty say she want some dick, I need the top first
It's gon' cost 'bout half a brick, you want a hot verse
