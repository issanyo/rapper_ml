[verse 1]:

They love me in the hood But they know I gotta leave em
Cut some homies off niggas thinking that I need them
Lil nigga hot but I really don't believe em
Youngings gon shoot so you know I gotta feed em
Traps for no reason
Blow racks for no reason
Gotta feed niggas the crack Cause they fiending
I was out chasing them stacks while they dreaming
They sleep taking them naps cause they leaning
That's how it be though
Niggas like Rico
Ill shooters like shaq with the free throw
With a geek hoe
She a freak though
She'll do anything for the team though
Mama told me boy make that shit
You just wanna be great just face that shit
You keep it real niggas hate that shit
Don't let a nigga tell you that you ain't that shit
And if you ain't got it better take that shit
Bows to the king
Down for the green
20 for the watch
A thou for the jeans
Riding with the thing
Shout outs to the team
Niggas stay down but they gon be straight
They fuck with me now
But that shit so fake
Young nigga eating got a lot on my plate
More money that you make
More nigga gon hate

[verse 2]:

Told rob Imma kill this shit
Everybody gon feel this shit
Niggas gon try to steal this shit
I can't let nobody hear this shit
I swear to god man these niggas so funny
I keep shit real what else do you want from me?
Young boss is what I'm running
Going hard we need some more money
In this shit forreal
Nigga play with me
That'll get em killed
Niggas know the deal
We'll blow the steel
Tell bro to chill
Niggas on forreal
Nigga go forreal
And ride through the city with a strap
Try ya luck if you think it's just rap
Bibby bout to put the squad on the map
I ain't left but nigga I'm back
I'm back I spit crack
That loud pack tryna relax
I push back that free crack
Tell my fiends it's time to relapse
I'm the hottest nigga out better know that
Too far in so a nigga can't go back
Make a fuck nigga ask was Hov back?
And I feel like these rap niggas so wack
