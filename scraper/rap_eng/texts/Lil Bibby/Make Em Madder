I let my pants sag low with that 40 on my hip
Keep it by my side in case a hater wanna trip
You should see they faces when I pull up in the whip
Niggas ask me why I do it, tell them that's just how I feel
I know these haters mad but imma make em madder
How you think I hit the lot and bought this fucking jaguar
Make em madder, imma make em madder
Why a hater think a nigga spending all this cash though

[Verse 1]
Just cashed out so you know I'm splurging
I be shitting on niggas on purpose
Money and rolls so niggas get nervous
Throw this money up, watch your bitch start twerking
I got bags, I dont do straps
And this big ass 40 make my trues sag
I got swag, that's why you mad
And it say 340 on my trues tag
Lil Bibby next up and your bitch know
And im sacked up, so watch your bitch go
What the fuck you wanna fight over a bitch for
My niggas don't fight that's what we got clips for
In the jag cruising, these hoes choosing
Say her man ain't doing shit, she don't like losing
At least she gave me brain, and I ain't have to ask her
Hop up in the jaguar I'm making niggas madder

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Everywhere I go, I got a big stupid rack
Don't try to rob me, I got a big stupid gat
Staining broke niggas every time im shooting rounds
Niggas plotting on me they gon get a do whacked
All I do is ball, man I want it all
[?]
Bitch I cash out every time I hit the mall
Got so many hoes idk why bitches call
No Limit MB we doing our thing
And I won't stop till my money Yao Ming
I be selling white, and smoking loud green
And it got my eyes looking like Yao Ming
Man I'm too sick, I think i need help
I just spent your rent money on a fucking belt
I don't really give a fuck what a nigga felt
Lil Bibby taking off, niggas get left

[Hook]
