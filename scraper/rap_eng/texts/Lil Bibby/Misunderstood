[Intro]
Lil Bibby
Jeremih and R. Kells

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
Picture perfect and I miss ya
Drink soda, live issue
They wanna leave
Man why they hatin'? Man why they hatin'?
You should gon' make 'em wait

[Hook: Jeremih & R. Kelly]
You're misunderstood girl, I thought you were a good girl
Know you do it so hood, hood, hood, hood
You know this is our first time
Excuse me, been here once before
You know you do it so good, good, good, good

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
I'm from the gutter, the jungle
Shorty from the islands
Gutter by herself man, now it's perfect timing
Slide a few miles in, now I got her smilin'
Waitin' around 9-10, now I got her wylin'
The kid's so stylish, I don't need a stylist
Chi-Town finest, keep that money pilin'
That's why these hoes tryna reel me in
I still be in
Balmains, filled with bands
When I'm hoppin' out that new coupe
Weezy on the chick, shawty said that she know voodoo
My LA chick she a Blood, we like Suwoo
That's why I keep the burner on me when I come and scoop you
This ain't what you used to

[Hook: Jeremih & R. Kelly]
You're misunderstood girl, I thought you were a good girl
Know you do it so hood, hood, hood, hood
You know this is our first time
Excuse me, been here once before
You know you do it so good, good, good, good

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Baseball bat, beat it up like that
Knock the pussy right out of the park
And it's out of here baby, out of here baby
Once you get your body off in the dark
First round I'mma go another round in it
Can't swim, so I'm about to drown in it
Game so persistent, girl I got a match book
He is an assistant, I am a head coach
If you like Kelly's music
Then put it on my lap and let's do this
Cinderella shawty you'se the cutest
And if you're freaky like me then the shoe fits
Never mind

[Hook: Jeremih & R. Kelly]
You're misunderstood girl, I thought you were a good girl
Know you do it so hood, hood, hood, hood
You know this is our first time
Excuse me, been here once before
You know you do it so good, good, good, good

[Outro: Jeremih]
Come on and sit it on my lap
Lap, lap, lap, lap, lap
Come on and sit iton my lap
Lap, lap, lap, lap, lap
Better stop talkin' in that tone, tone, tone
We spend money and what you gon', gon', gon'
Do it to a nigga till the morn', morn', morn'
Do it to a nigga till the morn', morn', morn'
That's why I never knew what you be on, on, on
But now I know Kris-Kross makes you jump, jump, jump
God damn, you're misunderstood
Give me a little time, there's no doubt I could
(Lil Bibby)
