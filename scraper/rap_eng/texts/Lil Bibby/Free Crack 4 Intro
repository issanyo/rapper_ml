[Intro: 50 Cent & Lil Bibby]
Got me feelin' real bulletproof in this motherfucker
'Cause the windows of my motherfuckin' Benz is bulletproof nigga (yeah)
And my motherfuckin' vest is bulletproof nigga (hah)
And my motherfuckin' hat is bulletproof nigga
But the doctor said if I get hit I could have a motherfuckin' concussion
But better that than a hole in my head, right nigga?
Hahaha (aw)

[Verse 1]
Bitch we armed and dangerous
You ain't no limit, can't hang with us
Ain't too many that can bang with us
Niggas want smoke, well flame it up
What you been smokin', some angel dust?
You're mad 'cause your bitch got a thang for us?
You really want smoke with the gang for her?
You thinkin' 'bout losing your brain for her?
Niggas got choppers, the same as us
But I don't really think they insane as us
We come to your block and change it up
They take off they jersey and hang 'em up
Look, I wanted to be like D-Rose
Mama was broke and I needed some clothes
Then I started wyling and kicking in doors
Looking for fiends that be playin' with they nose
Got off my ass and start settin' some goals
My neck got upgraded from silver to gold
I start a track, I need different hoes
I keep me a row, I need me a Rolls
Remember them times had to sleep on the floor
Now all my seats on the floor
M O B, won't pay a fee for a ho
And I still scream free the Ro
They want me chained up but I came up
Young nigga 'bout to fuck the game up
Movin' slow so I switched the lane up
Kept it Ben Frank, never changed up
If it's 'bout money you know I get plenty
I ride with the semi, I die with it with me
Don't try Lil Bibby, the savage is in me
I'ma get rich 'til I die like I'm Fifty

[Interlude]
I'm tired of fuckin' playin'
I got my recognition
I done came up every step I came up
I came up, I came up from these streets
Huh?
Look

[Verse 2]
Let's be serious, niggas be actin' like they on they period
Tellin' these lies but I am not hearing it
They play in the ride but I am not feeling it, cut it off
I do not like being lied to
EBK, let me remind you
Niggas be talkin' like gangsters until I go hop out, lil brother come find you
Kill everybody behind you
Or in the front and the side too
Your partner 'nem wanna be cool
If he fuck with you then he dying too
Niggas keep hating, I'm losing my patience
I fuck with some haitans who'll make you a patient
These niggas ain't gon' be satisfied
'Til the doc tell mama you ain't gon' make it
Nigga it's 'bout time that I go super saiyan
My brothers been telling me Bibby quit playin
I got a short temper so watch what you sayin'
Tell all these crackers just hurry and pay him
They don't understand, bitch I'm the man
Fuck her then kick the bitch out like she payin'
Dealt me the cards, just watch how I play 'em
Fuck a hit record, Free Crack for the land
