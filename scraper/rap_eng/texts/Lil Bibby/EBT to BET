[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'mma be one of the greatest I can feel it in my veins
People sell they soul just to try to get a name
Lost homies to the streets, had to charge it to the game
Seem like everybody changed, I guess that's the price of fame
But I knew you motherfuckers was gonna come right back
I sit back, relax, while I count these stacks
Bibby show up to your city, I need 10k flat
Got a couple homies with me that was in that trap
Now what the fuck do I need with a GED?
I went from EBT to BET
What the fuck can a damn high school teach me?
Man this rap shit got me set up, now I gotta keep my head up
I sit back and think, this weight on my shoulders
I might need a shrink, living drug free, man I might need a drink
(I'm goin' crazy and shit man)
Say I'm finna cop a Jesus piece cause niggas, they ain't seein' me
Critics, they critiquin' me, love when they don't believe in me
This real life, real facts, this ain't rap
Walk into that corner store, we had to stay strapped
Yeah, most of these niggas can't relate to that
Askin' all these questions, get the fuck up out my face with that
Shit, real talk, that's on everything
Desert Eagle, you don't wanna hear that bird sing

[Hook]
That's all I know
In these streets I can't let go
And I put that on everything
Desert Eagle, you don't wanna hear that bird sing
Yeah, that's all I know
In these streets I can't let go
And I put that on everything
You don't wanna hear that bird sing
Now what the fuck do I need with a GED?
I went from EBT to BET
And what the fuck do I need with a GED?

[Verse 2]
Had a dollar and a dream, momma was a fiend
Baggin' up the green while I plot and I scheme
Cars and the hoes that I watched on the screen
Come to find out shit is not what it seems
I'm bout to kill this shit, I feel this shit
Wish somebody would have warned me, I'd have quit this shit
Sometimes I wish I never did this
You know what man? Forget this shit
Cause sometimes I be thinkin' bout offin' myself
It's no one that I could trust, so I talk to myself
I understand this shit, that's how it feel to be the man and shit
A lot of niggas want this life, I swear they couldn't handle it
I stay in the newest shit like a mannequin
I got these niggas panicin' like "Bibby goin' HAM again"
Goin' hard, I want that Ghost and that Benz
Fucked up last night, smashed my man's girlfriend
Now she talkin' that EPT
Tryna have me back on EBT
No not me
I had to clip her like CP3
Man you niggas can't flow like me, hah

[Bridge]
That's all I know
In these streets I can't let go
And I put that on everything
Desert Eagle, you don't wanna hear that bird sing
Yeah, that's all I know
In these streets I can't let go
And I put that on everything
You don't wanna hear that bird sing
Now what the fuck do I need with a GED?
I went from EBT to BET
And what the fuck do I need with a GED?
And what the fuck do I need with a GED?
