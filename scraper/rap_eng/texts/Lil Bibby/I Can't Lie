[Verse 1]
Young nigga spent every day up in the streets
I ain't for the beef, I was out here tryna eat
Used to walk around with eight grams in my briefs
Now I'm on planes, getting change overseas
All I had to do is use my brain and believe
Think it's time to give the rap game what it need
Do this for the city, I'm the one they let speak
I'm the one that's giving all the game for the free
Do this for the real niggas just like me
Man if I get shot, is it Heaven for a G?
Heavy in the streets, lot of threats sent at me
So I ride around, MAC-11 on the seat
Won't they let a nigga be
Made it out the streets, I'm a god, I'm a chief
Yeah, real talk I'm something else
Doing all this shit with no help, real nigga what's up?

[Hook]
I won't lie, I can't lie
Be in the street, put my life on the line
I won't lie, I can't lie
I won't lie, I can't lie
I won't lie, I can't lie
Still ride around with my gun on my side
I won't lie, I can't lie
I won't lie, I can't lie

[Verse 2]
I swear to all gods rap changed my life
Luke told me, "Go hard," he ain't have to say it twice
Get a nigga murked, let me think, what's your price?
Give my boys the word, they'll do the shit tonight
And I got the shit locked
Whoever thought I'd be headed to the top?
‘Cause I swore I'd be caught by the cops
Either that or probably get shot
Gotta watch your back ‘cause there's niggas like dissin'
Heard you got the juice, now them boys out there pitchin'
Been around the world, now I see the bigger picture
Feeling like Hova, Biggie or Mystik
Soon as you make it, niggas gon' hate it
When they see success niggas don't know how to take it
You just turned from nothing into something in they faces
Now them niggas plotting on your money, tryna take it
Nigga, it's real

[Hook]
I won't lie, I can't lie
Been in the street, put my life on the line
I won't lie, I can't lie
I won't lie, I can't lie
I won't lie, I can't lie
Still ride around with my gun on my side
I won't lie, I can't lie
I won't lie, I can't lie
