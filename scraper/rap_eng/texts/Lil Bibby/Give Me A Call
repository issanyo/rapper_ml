[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Ayy turn the music up for me Chris
Fuck all that other shit
Drop that bitch
Look, ayy

[Chorus]
Yeah, that's my bitch, that's my dawg, yeah
Yeah, say that's my bitch, that's my dawg, yeah
Ayy, you hear this shit, give me a call
Give me a call, look, yeah, ayy
Look, yeah, that's my bitch, that's my dawg, yeah
Yeah, yeah, that's my bitch, that's my dawg, yeah
Look, you hear this shit, give me a call (give me a call)
Give me a call, look, ayy

[Verse 1]
I say that I don't want no model bitch, I don't want no bottle bitch
Need me a lil' gangsta bitch, one to keep it honest with
Need a lil' bitch to keep it real like lil' Brianna did
Pull up in her mama's whip, come and grab me from the strip
Told her I was hungry so we hit up that McDonald's lick
Pocket full of trap money, still ain't want nothin' from the kid
She know I ain't ready for kids, she ride with my Sig, she know how it is
She always be over at the crib, [?] my friends, she know how I live
Ran out of smoke, she run to the crib, if I was broke she'd give me her rib
Give me her last if I was down bad, the we both gon' be down bad
I know she ain't fuckin' with lames
She stay in her lane, she stay where them clowns at
She know I've been there with the gang
Pull up in that thang and get you from 'round there

[Chorus]
Ayy, yeah, yeah, that's my bitch, that's my dawg, yeah
Yeah, say that's my bitch, that's my dawg, yeah
Ayy, you hear this shit, give me a call
Give me a call, look, yeah, ayy
Look, yeah, that's my bitch, that's my dawg, yeah
Yeah, yeah, that's my bitch, that's my dawg, yeah
Look, you hear this shit, give me a call (give me a call)
Give me a call, look, ayy

[Verse 2]
Look, now she with whatever
She pull up whenever I call, no matter the weather
You got a new fellow but you could do better
My dawg, I got you forever
And nah I ain't hatin' but girl I'm just sayin'
You told me that nigga be playin'
Remember when I was your man
You said y'all was friends, he prolly was waitin'
You told me that nigga was crazy
Better not ever lay a hand on my baby
Glock with no safety
It's far from them days when I used to tote the .380
And no I don't beef 'bout a bitch
But for her I'ma ride like I ride for my clique
'Cause when them cops got behind of my whip
She was grabbin' my stash and was hidin' my shit
Still'll take a nigga now that I'm lit
Take her to Sak's, gotta buy out the drip
And every Christmas I buy her a gift
Give her the coupe, she can't ride in a Lyft
Ain't no doubt that she gon' ride, yeah
If she would die I would cry to tears
And I know we ain't talked or nothin' in 'bout a year
But just take down my number, you know that I'm here

[Chorus]
Ayy, yeah, yeah, that's my bitch, that's my dawg, yeah
Yeah, say that's my bitch, that's my dawg, yeah
Ayy, you hear this shit, give me a call
Give me a call, look, yeah, ayy
Look, yeah, that's my bitch, that's my dawg, yeah
Yeah, yeah, that's my bitch, that's my dawg, yeah
Look, you hear this shit, give me a call (give me a call)
Give me a call, look, ayy
