[Intro: Lil Herb]
(Gang!)
Aye, Bibby, what up bro man
150 Roc Block shit man, L's
Niggas don't want smoke man
These niggas don’t want no smoke man
You want smoke man, let us know something
Vito city shit, bitch

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
I be with some young wild niggas, they’ll blow somethin'
If you want smoke boy, let a nigga know somethin'
Pussy ass niggas talking shit, ain’t on nothin'
Fuck niggas sneak dissin, let a nigga know somethin'
Let a nigga know somethin', let a nigga know somethin'
If you want smoke boy let a nigga know somethin'
Let a nigga know somethin', let a nigga know somethin'
If you want smoke boy let a nigga know somethin'

[Verse 1: Lil Herb]
I be with some young wild niggas, smoking loud, nigga
Mally got that .40 cal with him, blow you down, nigga
I come to the block and post up
I don’t be up in the hood just to put no post up for my Instagram
I see niggas putting posts up on they Instagram
Like you niggas really on something, them lil instabands
If you want smoke let me know something, we attend to that
Pull up right there where you post up, we remember that
4-5 double barrels, boy we got long noses
Let his homies know to send his mama all roses
Sipping the 4, ACT make me fall over
Run up on me pussy, clap, now it's all over
Nigga I be spendin' racks, turn em all over
Ball till you fall, nigga what you fall over?
If I ever fall, nigga, I'mma ball over
Started from the bottom, I’ll do it all over
Nigga I be fresh as fuck, Louie all over
All white Ones, nigga, I don't like loafers
Squad hit the club, buying all white Rosé's
Throwing bands, gettin' mud on the all white sofas
Want war? 50 clip for all ya'll soldiers
Niggas bitches taking group pictures, all ya'll posers
Young nigga couple chains, all 'em frozen
Couple hits out the foreign cars, all 'em stolen

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
You sneak dissin' like a ho or something
Have my young niggas show 'em something
Headshot, I'll throw 'em something
I’mma make sure he know it's comin'
And my squad won’t go for nothin'
If it’s beef let me know or somethin'
If I’m lacking then blow or somethin'
Catch Bibby at the store or somethin'
Bro came out the coat with somethin'
Fuck rap homie, I’m in the trap, homie
Work came in put my tax on it, real shit, I ain’t gotta act, homie
Feds come through, I'm running out the back, homie
Couple hollows to the back homie
That's what you get running from the mack, homie
Turn nothin' into somethin', got a young nigga stuntin'
We ain’t worried bout nothing, cause we strapped, homie
Hut one hut two, hittas on point, they ready to slump you
Niggas all quiet, when my squad come through
Brand new Glock let’s see what the gun do
Them checks I thumb thru, I be flexed up, these niggas can’t take it
Ain’t about money, then a nigga can’t make it
Fuck her from the back and her head was whack
I pass her to Pat, the bitch is so basic
Hoes go crazy when they see Lil Bibby
Young ass nigga, got the keys to the city
Me and lil' bro just speedin' in the Hemi
In the club squad getting off the weed and the Remy
If you want beef then let a nigga know
Subtweeting, why you won't at a nigga for?
You try to tell Bibby, just let this shit go
Till' we show up with them K's then we at a nigga door

[Hook]
