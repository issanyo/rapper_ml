[Hook]
Ay, I used to sleep on the floor
I'm never gon' do that no more
I gotta keep me a pole
Especially when I'm in the go
I know these niggas are slow
Niggas be lying in raps
I just be hiding the facts
Too many guys got whacked
I keep it real for real
You know I can't fake it
I got the devil on me now
You know I'mma shake it
Rappers be tucking their chain
The guys will take it
I keep it real for real
I keep it real for real

[Verse]
Look, ay, I keep it real for real
Gotta quit popping them pills
Heard you was facing them years
Heard you was taking a deal
I got some homies down state
Wish they could get an appeal
All of they lips is sealed
We do this shit for real
Niggas be dissing the king
Boy I never heard of ya
I got a hell of a team
Yeah, I be with murderers
Some of us burglars
I was a server, ain't talking bout burgers
I love when it rain
Just give me the pain
The feeling of pain I love it
I took a loss, my bitches got lost
And that's when I gained the money
I go insane for money
I eat your brain for money
I used to post on the block
I guess I changed for money

[Hook]
Ay, I used to sleep on the floor
I'm never gon' do that no more
I gotta keep me a pole
Especially when I'm in the go
I know these niggas are slow
Niggas be lying in raps
I just be hiding the facts
Too many guys got whacked
I keep it real for real
You know I can't fake it
I got the devil on me now
You know I'mma shake it
Rappers be tucking their chain
The guys will take it
I keep it real for real
I keep it real for real
