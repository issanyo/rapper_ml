[Verse 1]
Went from trapping out of them bandos
To tryna grab that new Lambo
In the rap game but I ain't playing though
I'ma take it far as it can go
I done heard your tracks, I don't feel that shit
They talk that shit but I live that shit
Gotta copyright the flow â€˜cause they steal that shit
Boy you knowing damn well you ain't did that shit
Serving that white in the trenches
Watch for the cops and the snitches
I was trapping just minding my business
Don't try me I'm dumping them fists
Niggas get jealous like bitches
I'm feeling like all of you niggas my children
They know that all of my clips is extended
Trust me and all of you niggas can get it
Give a fuck what you heard
All that sneak dissin' gon' get some niggas murked
Niggas spreading rumors but that shit won't work
Shooters don't go there, put you in the Earth, have your squad rocking shirts
Got a plug, I just make one call for the work
All them young niggas selling hard by the church
'Bout half a brick is what I charge for the verse
Just killed the track, go and throw it in a hearse

[Verse 2]
Block nigga, Glock gripper
Certified trap nigga, shop with us
Play with me, you get popped, nigga
You ain't gotta push me, I ain't Pac, nigga
And I been in the field like I'm Ken Griffey
Rap on your block, got them sticks with me
They hating, that shit, you can miss Bibby
Shooters gon' go if you diss Bibby
Lil young nigga, tryna get his fame up
Got a couple retweets, now he think he came up
If we did start it then how can you blame us?
Have the ambulance come pick his brains up
I'm straight from the go, I get paid for the flow
I remember them nights that I laid on the flo'
I know that them fuck niggas hate it
But now my community gated
