[Verse 1]
I won't change, trap hard
Turn a quarter ounce to a whole thing
Ain't no shame with my game
Young nigga take a loss and don't complain
Street nigga, Glock-9, Tec-9
Keep with us, beef with us
My squad a bunch of lions in the jungle
Fuck nigga can't eat with us
Got dope, coke, kush, dro, for the low
Need somethin'? Let me know
I'm out of town in the stu'
Still trappin', fuck nigga just called broke
Let's make it happen, callin' plays, young Madden
Most wanted, Bin Laden
Young niggas come through
Try to run, red dot, real master
Got foreign cars, foreign clothes, foreign hoes
Extended clips, foreign poles
Real shit, real hittas, doin' hits
Murk niggas, never told
Got a 50 shot Glock .40 with a drum
Hop out, nigga run
Niggas know where I stay
I ain't worried about shit, let 'em come
Got Mac-10s, ARs, AKs, FNs, my best friend
I keep a gun, sleep with guns
Dumb nigga, try your luck, step in
Fully auto, double trigger, tappin' ones
Hollow tips catch ten

[Hook]
It's my ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)
My ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)
My ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)
My ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)
My ambitions as a rider, don't get fired up (don't get fired up)

[Verse 2]
I pull up with Lil G, and G Slim, and Lil Squeak
Slide down on Lamron, Lil Reese throwin' up two threes
Young boss with the two T's
I stay countin' that blue cheese
Niggas said they gon' do me
So I ride around with a few heats
Been paranoid for like two weeks
In the van with that .223
Spent 30k on my neck bitch
Try to rob me? Gotta shoot me
Don't fuck around with no rap niggas
I post up with them crack dealers
Young niggas that jack niggas
And ride around and whack niggas
Still bumpin' that Illmatic in traffic
Glock-20 that's still in plastic
Thick bitch, she real rachet
I'mma still smash it
Got all eyes on me
Niggas act like they know me
Bibby, I'm a young OG
I don't fuck with no police
No we don't play them games nigga
We don't fuck with no lames nigga
Sit your five dollar ass down before I make change nigga
You lookin' just like a stain nigga

[Hook]
It's my ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)
My ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)
My ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)
My ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)
My ambitions as a rider, don't get fired up (don't get fired up)
