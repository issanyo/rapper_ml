[Chorus: Lil Bibby]
Hunnid deep with the crew, that's how we move (yeah)
My young boys got that tool, that's how we move
Out here trapping, fuck that school, that's how we move (yeah)
That's how we move, yeah, that's how we move
Hunnid deep with the crew, that's how we move (yeah)
My young boys got that tool, that's how we move
Out here trapping, fuck that school, that's how we move (yeah)
That's how we move, yeah, that's how we move

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
I'm a rap god, I trap hard, this shit ain't that hard
They act hard, let the MAC spark, turn niggas to track stars
It's no limit, I'm gon get it, don't sneak diss on that squad
Fuck a bitch about 4 minutes, won't waste time with that broad
Young niggas, dope dealers, some of my niggas crack cards
Niggas talking that tough talk and it's shots fired at that boy
Young niggas we savage, catch a nigga in traffic
Niggas dying in my city, they like, "please stop the madness"
M.O.E that's how it be, I put this money shit before me
And my lil' homie just did three, just let all my niggas free
I've been riding 'round with that heat but I've been tryna keep the peace
All these foot soldiers in these streets trying to get a name off me
Trust me, you don't want that beef, it's bodies on that heat
And the last nigga that tried it may his soul rest in peace
Nigga, you don't want that beef, my niggas won't go sweet
And the last nigga that tried it may his soul rest in peace

[Chorus: Lil Bibby]
Hunnid deep with the crew, that's how we move (yeah)
My young boys got that tool, that's how we move
Out here trapping, fuck that school, that's how we move (yeah)
That's how we move, yeah, that's how we move
Hunnid deep with the crew, that's how we move (yeah)
My young boys got that tool, that's how we move
Out here trapping, fuck that school, that's how we move (yeah)
That's how we move, yeah, that's how we move

[Verse 2: King Louie]
Man, I ain't with that fuck shit, tell a fuck nigga suck dick
Sneak dissing on the internet, will get you whacked in public
Balling hard no sub shit, cracking cards all dub shit
V12 I'm a minute man, ride with blickers in a minivan
Arm, leg, leg, arm, leg, spot an opp and then we get him dead
Finessing bitches I may renig. Other words she gave free head
On my operation goon shit, I'm someone you should get in tune with
Smoking dope in a foreign whip, dirty money got a nigga clean
Open heads in the magazine, turn a party to a murder scene
If I send them then they murdering: silent shots, they ain't heard a thing
M.O.B won't give a bird a wing, straight drop then hit the lean
Double trigger, 40 with a beam will really show me what a nigga mean
Face shots on the back block, try to run, get your back popped
AK make a MAC stop, flip a nigga like a laptop
30 shot got my hand hot, law come we ain't saying shit
We ain't on that playing shit, we'll come through spraying shit

[Chorus: Lil Bibby]
Hunnid deep with the crew, that's how we move (yeah)
My young boys got that tool, that's how we move
Out here trapping, fuck that school, that's how we move (yeah)
That's how we move, yeah, that's how we move
Hunnid deep with the crew, that's how we move (yeah)
My young boys got that tool, that's how we move
Out here trapping, fuck that school, that's how we move (yeah)
That's how we move, yeah, that's how we move
