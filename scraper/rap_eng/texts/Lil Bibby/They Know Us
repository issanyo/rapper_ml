[Hook: Sean Kingston & Lil Bibby]
Ask about us in the streets, they know us
All my niggas tote heat, they know us
Juggin', running from police, they know us
Aw yeah, they know us, oh yeah, they know us
Mama told me put it down, but I can't, no
I'm still trapping out the bando
Mama told me put it down, but I can't, no
I'm on a mission, got it stacked up
Ask about us in the streets, they know us
All my niggas totin heat, they know us
Young'n running from police, they know us
Aw yeah, they know us, oh yeah, they know us

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
So you know I get that money 6 ways
Get paid, young nigga, all I do is get paid
I know I be a thug way since I been in sixth grade
My mama works at Micky D's, she was getting slaved
She say stay up off the streets, if yo' ass can't take the heat
You better not run from none of that beef, you better not talk to no police
My homie caught a case, start preaching like he mace
And that OG Bobby Johnson, fuck up out my face
He was selling big pounds, I was counting clean cash
Fucking all these bad bitches, he ain't never had bitches
They know I'm plugged in the streets, they know us
All my niggas talk heat, they know us

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
No Limit MB run the east, they know us
Foe'nem lurking, tote heat, they gon' bust
This ain't a nine or a 45, nah this a Draco bruh
Just hit me the headline on your tour, still 100k on us
You fuck niggas wanna kill me, I no hate, I be flexing
Cost me 20 for my trunks, 20 for my necklace
Some my niggas ain't seen 20, that might be his best wish
So if I put 'em up a 20, write your fam a death wish
Play with G Herbo, baretta spit
Growin' up I done did hella shit
Shootouts etc. feel like a veteran
That's why I be sipping the medicine
Glock 23, that's a 40 with hollows
I keep it on me like a letterman
In the back of the town with the stick
They driving my wheel like the president, nigga
