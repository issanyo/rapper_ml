[Chorus:]
I hustle too hard to do what I want, when I want
I fuck bitches when I want, when I want
I drive foreigns nigga when I want, when I want
I take pills nigga when I want, when I want
I hustle too hard to do what I want, when I want
I fuck bitches when I want, when I want
I drive foreigns nigga when I want, when I want
I take drugs nigga when I want, when I want
I do what I want

[Verse 1: Trav]
Pussy niggas they forgot about me, funny thing they was never bout it
Pull the tank out I am bout it bout it, Master P nigga UUGGGHHHH
Lean got me nodding off, this ain't what really you want
Phone call knock you off, only dealing with the boss
Never dealing with no middle man, play with paper then we killing him
Old gay nigga militant, fuck it nigga kill the witness then
I was born for this flexing, never ever felt no pressure
100 thousand for my necklace, bought a [?] just to flex with
Bought a crib for mama, 7 houses for Madonna
Spending bands fuck up commas, live today fuck tomorrow
Niggas know I ain't playing round, been a shooter since the playground
Fuck around bring that K round, another day another man down

[Chorus:]
I hustle too hard to do what I want, when I want
I fuck bitches when I want, when I want
I drive foreigns nigga when I want, when I want
I take pills nigga when I want, when I want
I hustle too hard to do what I want, when I want
I fuck bitches when I want, when I want
I drive foreigns nigga when I want, when I want
I take drugs nigga when I want, when I want
I do what I want

[Verse 2: Blac Youngsta]
Young rich nigga selling marijuana on the corner
Lamborghini cost 200 something and I'm the owner
I done lost a whole lot of homies, I miss my homies
I'll whack a nigga by my lonely, when I wanna
I do what I want lil nigga, I got [?] in my stone lil nigga
I know niggas facing like 150, 23 and 1 can't get no visit
They gon have to spend they whole life in prison
I ain't gon never ever forget my niggas
I don't give a damn about these bitches

[Chorus:]
I hustle too hard to do what I want, when I want
I fuck bitches when I want, when I want
I drive foreigns nigga when I want, when I want
I take pills nigga when I want, when I want
I hustle too hard to do what I want, when I want
I fuck bitches when I want, when I want
I drive foreigns nigga when I want, when I want
I take drugs nigga when I want, when I want
I do what I want

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby]
Young nigga do what I wanna, pull out them whips in the summer
I ran that cycle myself, won't catch me asking for help
I came from the gutter, the slums, I got that check and bought hundreds of guns
My teacher she said I was dumb but I hit the mall spend money for fun
My mama she had Section 8, I know that these boys can't relate
I needed food on my plate, so I started selling that weight
Young nigga straight from the projects, I just want your face baby I don't want no sex
Might spend 30 thou on a Rolex

[Chorus:]
I hustle too hard to do what I want, when I want
I fuck bitches when I want, when I want
I drive foreigns nigga when I want, when I want
I take pills nigga when I want, when I want
I hustle too hard to do what I want, when I want
I fuck bitches when I want, when I want
I drive foreigns nigga when I want, when I want
I take drugs nigga when I want, when I want
I do what I want
