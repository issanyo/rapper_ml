[Hook]
I won't hide the ways I've tried
It's just not right it's, killing me tonight
I won't hide the ways I've tried
It's just not right it's, killing me tonight

[Verse 1]
Now shit's gettin' heavy on my shoulders
I keep it to myself, I promise I never show it
I tell myself nobody cares, bucks, just keep it goin'
It's like I'm dying inside but you would never know it
Gotta stay strong cause I got fam ridin' for me
Soldiers on the front line, I know they dyin' for me
Still heavy in the streets but that's a different story
Came through in the clutch I'm like that nigga Horry
For three
This how it's 'posed to be, I wonder will they notice me
All these frenemies, man I can't let nobody close to me
Kind hearted, man I swear I always looked out
But niggas they forgettin', still have they hands stuck out
Say fuck 'em all, I'm gon' do this shit for me now
How I feel, I need a shrink on speed dial
Off the top, this might be my realest freestyle
Now bring the chorus in, I think it's time to leave now

[Hook]
I won't hide the ways I've tried
It's just not right it's, killing me tonight
I won't hide the ways I've tried
It's just not right it's, killing me tonight
I won't hide the ways I've tried
It's just not right it's, killing me tonight

[Verse 2]
In the hood I'm a motherfuckin' legend
You ain't gotta feel me, just respect it
I be walkin' round, 20 thou for the necklace
All these niggas know that we'll come through and wet shit
Plus my shooters gettin' bored, they'll love that
But I ain't really for that, I've been there, I've done that
Know I left the hood but I'mma always come back
Check up on my niggas in the spots that I hung at
Nigga had a dream
It was jealousy that probably be the death of me
Now I don't leave the house without a Tec with me
Gotta go hard, the squad expect nothing less from me
Put her on the block list, bitch think she stressin' me

[Outro]
Shit so motherfuckin' hard man, ay
I'mma let her sing
Keep it like that
Fuck with that B? Fuck with the flow on that?
