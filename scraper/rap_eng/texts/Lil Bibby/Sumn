Aye, aye, aye

[Verse 1 : Lil Bibby]
I done been through some hard times
I keep it on me at all times
I keep a .40 when I'm in LA
I keep a Draco when I'm in the 8
Ready for war, I got racks in the bank
Dissin the gang, get shot in the face
Call up them hittas, they not from the pay
Last nigga tried me, got shot in the day-time
And I heard sumthin (?)
Lil niggas say they gon take mine
But everywhere I go, I take mine
It's gon be the reason they stay down
Got some young niggas
They go hard, yeah
And they gon rob, yeah, yeah
Like that's they job (Huh)
