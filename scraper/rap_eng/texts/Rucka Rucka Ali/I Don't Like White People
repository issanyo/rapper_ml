Intro
We are going to exterminate white people
Because that, in my estimation, is the only conclusion I have come to
We have to exterminate white people off of the face of the planet
To solve this problem

Ohhh (Hey!)
I just don't like white people (people)
The Bible says they're evil (evil)
If honkies wanna go
Let's get it on (Let's get it on)
Ohhh (Hey!)
They be always jockin' at the mall (the mall)
Sippin' mochachinos (chinos)
Can't we all get along
Hell no

Hey yo
Have you ever wondered why white men can't jump?
They too busy drivin' around on mopeds (gopeds)
Drivin' a damn Ford Focus
Sittin' in the crib with they kids playin' Go Fish!
Goldfish and golden retrievers
I can't believe these idiots still wear Reeboks
Reba get's these retard off
We should keep them locked up with some coffee
They love coffee
It's always coffee
They watch Oprah Winfrey often
They all mormons
They all call up Dr. Lora and ask her stuff
They play golf with suntan lotion
And they all gots they shirts tucked in
They all wear suspenders
And they got bowties under they chin
They cannot dress
They always stress
"I need my pills 'cause I'm depressed"
White girls always have fake breasts
Like the feedin saeline to they kids
They drive Hybrids
They listen to Kiss
They get they movies from Netflix
They all so rich
I say we jock 'em
They got no rythm but they square dance
Maybe crackers wouldn't suck at sports
Spend less time in the Strarbucks with quarts of coffee
Private plays that are gettin' gay with the Facebook page
I don't like white people on the real
Whites been gay, they wait for years
Why can't we find out where they live
And bust through a window into they cribs?

Ohhh (Hey!)
I just don't like white people (people)
The Bible says they're evil (evil)
If honkies wanna go
Let's get it on (Let's get it on)
Ohhh (Hey!)
They be always jockin' at the mall (the mall)
Sippin' mochachinos (chinos)
Can't we all get along
Hell no

Jesus, black
Ronald Regan, sold crack
Did we pay 'em? Fuck that
That nigga got jacked
Get the facts and ask them crackers for answers
Put some pants on and get a buss pass
We the ones they be always harassin'
They the ones we should all be blastin'
Up in Aspen
In a mansion
Can't dance cause they got no fashion
And these assholes at the bash brawl, they all so white we could call them Casper
I command for them bastard crackers
Hey Barack, can we blow up Alaska?
Could we roll up to the NASCAR with the ass on the lassos to catch all them assholes

Let me talk in a way you crackers could understand

Hello, there. I wear blue jean pants
I own three dogs and thirteen cats
I keep my children away from rap
I get all my clothes at the GAP
I've lived in a condo most my life
Every now and then, I beat my wife
Her name is Linda
My name is Tod
Have you seen my fishing rod?

Ohhh (Hey!)
I just don't like white people
The Bible says they're evil (evil)
If honkies wanna go
Let's get it on (Let's get it on)
Ohhh (Hey!)
They be always jockin' at the mall (the mall)
Sippin' mochachinos (chinos)
Can't we all get along
Hell no

Oh, he-he-hello
Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
You guys makin' a hip-hippity-hop song?
Cool, very cool
My children love that shit!
Oh, you know, I love hippity-hop
Hey! But can I get on this song?
I-I've always wanted to get on a hippity-hop song
But-But my wife...my wife she, she's afraid of black people
I-it's not that they're black
It's just the color of their skin that scares her
And, you know, it's like my father always used to say
"Don't hate the cracker, hate the race"

*clap, clap*

Guys? Wh-wh-why are the lights off?
I-I can't see you...'Cause you're black

*punching sounds*

UGH!
AWW!
OH!
OH!
OH!
Oh, my-my head!
Do I taste blood?
That really stings!
I've never been stabbed before!
W-w-what's that?
I-is that a...

*Cocking Gun*

Oh, yeah, definatley is
