[Verse 1]
Everyone at my school called me a fag
At home I was lied to blowing my dad
So now I would like to kill all of the jews
I just saw my gas bill and I want to die
But before I go, I will tell you goodbye
I will be back someday in the form of Tom Cruise

[Chorus 1]
In another life I will take the world
I will make it wonderbar for all the white people
If you're not a white, I will make you slaves
Turn you to soap and wash my Schwanzstucker on your face
I know it sounds gay

[Verse 2]
I could have lived my life in a better way
I could have been nicer to gypsies and gays
People in the wheelchairs I never should have raped (I know this now!)
Why did I put numbers and tattoos on jews?
However could I know the third Reich would lose?
Now that numbers for how much the jews will sue

[Chorus 2]
But in another life I will gas them all
I will gas the jews that sell the jewelry at the mall
In another life I will make it great
Until then Melvin Gibsonstein will show the world the way
He'll show you all the way

[Verse 3]
I want to take over the world, kill all the gays, it would be very great
If I could only change one thing in life it'd be
I'd go and put a gas chamber in Italy
I could have killed grandparents of Pauly D
But now, but now it's much too late

[Chorus 1]
In another life I will take the world
I will make it wonderbar for all the white people
If you're not a white, I will make you slaves
Turn you to soap and wash my Schwanzstucker on your face
I know it sounds gay

[Outro]
I want to take over the world, kill all gays
In another life I will make it great
Until then Melvin Gibsonstein will show the world the way
Justin Bieberg is gay
(It's a spic 'n' span!)
