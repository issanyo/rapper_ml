Verse 1:
Everything was great 'till I showed up
That's the message that I get from the hate like
Wait a minute, hold up!
9-11 hung up when ya called up
So who ya gunna call when the airplane rolled up?
Supa Black Man, I'm a coke'd up Superhero
Lookin' like a cross 'tween 2Pac and Bob Deniro
Like a boss, I'm lonely, I land on my feet
When I speak up, but at what cost?
Have we lost as a culture?
Free Speech tossed to the side by the butthurt
PC Vultures
Fuck you! Look what you done!
I'm the one cleanin' up after all you cunts!
Everyone it's!

Chorus:
(Supa Black Maaaaaan x4) Yo, I'm here to help you
I got drugs to sell you!
I fight for Justice!
But nobody will trust us

Verse 2:
Fucks this internet, I never heard of it
Kitty kat pictures account for a third of it
Pictures of tits for some fat kid to fap, sittin' back
Talkin smack, with some faggots playin' Minecraft?
Fuck this shit, I don't even go online!
I send smoke signals, so my nuckas know when it's time
Cuz what I'm doin' is fine, but what I do is a crime
And when you look for truth
You won't always know what ya find, yo!
I knocked over a couple buildings, my bad!
You'd understand with the life I had
See I was born in Jail, I'ma die in Jail
And if I see you in Jail, I'll fuck your ass for real!
I never knew what was wrong
I never knew what was right
I wasn't White
So I didn't know how to read or to write
But I could fight, so I did
I killed and I stole shit
My X-Ray Vision sees through the bullshit

Chorus:
(Supa Black Maaaaaaaan x8)Yo, I'm from the Streets!
Got smokey treets!
Man fuck da po-lice!
I got a gold piece!
Yo, I'm here to help you!
I got drugs to sell you!
I fight for Justice!
But nobody will trust us!

(Chaos on the streets of Detroit
As Notorious Black Man, Rucka Rucka Ali, is finally
Arrested on 85 counts... Of being Black.)
(Let me go man! Dis some bullshit, dis just like when they arrested O.J!)
(Know I'm sayin'? That's a 'Merican Hero!)
(He rushed 2, 000 Yards in 1973, Free O.J.!)

Chorus:
(Supa Black Maaaaaan x8) Yo, I'm innocent!
Tell, I didn't do shit!
This all some bullshit...
Cause I didn't do shit!
Yo, I'm here to help you!
I got drugs to sell you!
I fight for justice!
But nobody will trust us!

Verse 3:
So remember this day, I try to help out
But the World all pushed me away, it's gay
When will the hate end toward me!
When Jesus brings us some love and some pizza!?
And he was Black too, cause he a Blak Jew!
Tryna send a message but it must not fax through!
And if I ask you where we all goin'
Would ya say we got one whole pad he's only known as!

Chorus:
(Supa Black Maaaaaaan x12)
Yo, I'm here to help you!
I got drugs to sell you!
I fight for Justice!
But nobody will trust us!
Yo, I'm the Blackest!
I know where the Crack is!
I kill people for practice!
So ya best wear jackets!
Yo, I'm here to help you!
I got drugs to sell you!
I fight for Justice!
But when we go to Jail, yeah, it's just us
