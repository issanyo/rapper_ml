[Verse 1]
I was just an average dude, ah
Neckbeard sittin' in my bedroom, ah
Smokin' on a little some green Buddha
Eatin' some crappy British food, ah
Never leave the house without a fedora
Never really leave or ever go out
Online's where I get to be rude, ah
Video games will never break my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when I saw the fuckin' witch Anita
On the Feminist Frequency
Talkin' about people like me
Sayin' gamers are mean and we don't like the ladies
She said that she's a gamer since she ten
And she wanna bring down all the gamer men
That's when the nerd rage hit me and then
I transformed to the warlord I became

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I'm the mofuckin' Sargon
Look what you've done
I'm the mofuckin' Sargon

[Verse 2]
Everyday women wanna put me out
Everyday YouTube try to take me down
Tried to come after my Patreon
It's like I'm takin' on a feminist jihad
Martin Luther King by today's child
Is called an Uncle Tom that should get fired
Jess Philip mad that I wouldn't rape her
Trevor Noah put a claim on a fuckin' picture

[Pre-Chorus]
And now the media label me
Alt-right Klansman Nazi
Because I'm anti-identity
Like my white male founding father relatives
I've been anointed the new face
Of the defense of the Western civilization
Mostly defending my brain from integration
And defending my neck from a razor blade

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I'm the mofuckin' Sargon
Look what you've done
I'm the mofuckin' Sargon

[Verse 3]
Industry badges, internet friends hangin' at the convention
Front row with Andy and the Chrises
Waiting by the panel by some business
Women here to give a talk
'Bout the struggles of bein' girls and stuff
No one is looking to disrupt
Autism's all that we have in common

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I saw Anita look at me
And she's the Beauty to my Beast
And then she pointed and said I be
A garbage human lil sexist piece of shit
But if I could ask your grace
How's it feel lookin' at the face
Of the monster you created
I just wanted to play video games

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I'm the mofuckin' Sargon
Look what you've done
I'm the mofuckin' Sargon
Look what you've done
I'm the mofuckin' Sargon
Look what you've done
I'm the mofuckin' Sargon
