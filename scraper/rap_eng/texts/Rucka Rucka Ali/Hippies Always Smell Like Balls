[Intro]
All hippies are dirty and ugly
They're all covered in fleas
We should hang 'em from trees

Round 'em up with me
Shoot 'em once in the knee
Drag 'em down the damn street
I got two under my...
TRUCKS!
I hate 'em!

[Rapper]
First of all
Hippies always smell like balls
And they're all a bunch of
Tree huggin'
Dumb fuckin'
Butt fuckers

Run, hippie, run!
I got twenty one guns wit me
Come around town
And your done if you fuck with me

Yeah, drum circle
Ching Chang Chong!
Get some goddamn balls
In your goddamn song

Get a goddamn jerb
Your a goddamn bum
I get drunk on rum
And kill hippies for fun

[Verse]
Now I'm a nice guy
But hippies are gay
They're always gettin' high
And spreadin' the AIDS

I'd love to find
Some hippies in my yard
Playin' their guitar
They're gettin' sprayed

So listen up
Hippies
Gettin' shot dead
In the new green

Yeah
My name is
Toby Queef
I was sent here by Rucker Rucker Ali

[Chorus]
Yawl hippies
Please stay away from me
You'll be dead if I see you
Hangin' 'round Tennessee

Better run hippie
Eat your LSD
Tell your friends 'bout me
Yeah, I'm comin' with a...
GUNS!
I hate 'em!

All hippies are dirty and ugly
They're all covered in fleas
We should hang 'em from trees

Round 'em up with me
Shoot 'em once in the knee
Drag 'em down the damn street
I got two under my...
TRUCKS!
I hate 'em!

[Verse]
I have a farm
With plenty of grain
But hippies could starve
That's fine with me

God help you all
When Im president
Yawl hippies will be slaves
And probably dead

Suck on my balls
Hippies
Get your ass fucked in the booty

Yeah
Lick on my nuts
If you please
Go read a book
For vegan revolutionaries

All hippies are some vegan pussies
Eatin' dog feces
Yous hould eat a little meat

Always pretending
To like Bob Marley
He sucks a big D
You should grow a couple...
NUTS!
I hate 'em!

All hippies are dirty and ugly
They're all covered in fleas
We should hang 'em from trees

Round 'em up with me
Shoot 'em once in the knee
Drag 'em down the damn street
I got two under my...
TRUCKS!
I hate 'em!

Where were you September 12?
I was shootin' me some hippies
Real good in the chest
If you don't like this darn Country
You suyre as hell ain't Toby Queef

[Rapper - Toby Queef]
I'm a little bit of Country
With a little bit of fist in your mug, homie
I'm a female bangin'
Racar wagin'
Jesus save me
I got ne teeth!

I'm a Decent Man
I just don't like
Asshole hippies dancin'
Without no pants on
Reminds me of the first time I heard rap music
I was like
"Did he say N*****? I like this guy!

[Chorus]
Yawl hippies
Please stay away from me
You'll be dead if I see you
Hangin' 'round Tennessee

Better run hippie
Eat your LSD
Tell your friends 'bout me
Yeah, I'm comin' with a gun
I hate 'em!

All hippies are dirty and ugly
They're all covered in fleas
We should hang 'em from trees

Round 'em up with me
Shoot 'em once in the knee
Drag 'em down the damn street
I got two under my truck
I hate 'em!
