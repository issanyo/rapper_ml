[Verse 1]

Hey there little kids
My name's Jared
I'm a friend
Can I eat a sandwich with
You
How bout' a footlong
Wheat or white
What kinda bread?
Help me squeeze the mayo out this
Tube

Got my mind on your body
And your body's only 9
Have a taste of my Teriyaki sauce
You wanna try?

[Bridge]

Don't tell your mother
Kiss the cucumber
It's time for supper
I'm the footlong lover

[Chorus]

5
5 dollar foot
5 dollar footdong

[Verse 2]

Put me down
You scream and start to cry
Don't be scared, just have a little bite
I'm Jared, I'm the subway guy
Let's do a line
I'm the footlong lover

Guess how many kids I could fit in these pants
Have you had the meatballs? They're good
Yes I like my subs like I like my women
I like them 6 and 12
Yeah

Got my mind on your body
And your body's only 9
Add some chips and a drink for just $1.99

[Bridge]

Go get your brother
I got a boner
Would you like that toasted?
I'm the footlong lover

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

Take a bath with me and close the blinds
Here's some ranch, you got it in your eye
I tuck my shirt in all the time
Now you know why
I'm the footlong lover

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]

Shhh
I gotta boner
Uhh... I'll have the kids meal with extra kids
Got my mind on your body
And your body's only 9
C'mon guys
Even Michael Jackson got three second chances
Have a taste of my Minisub, it grows into a Grinder
How about if I go through your Craigslist history?
Wanna know what my favourite sub is?
Turkey Ham

Eat this double meaty yummy sub
Tell your parents that you played outside
Chicken's still in the microwave
Each fuckin' time

I'm the footlong lover
Turkey ham
I'm the footlong lover
I like kids, is that a fuckin' crime?
No, please don't fuckin' start to cry
Or you will die
I'm the footlong lover

[Chorus]

I'm the footlong lover
