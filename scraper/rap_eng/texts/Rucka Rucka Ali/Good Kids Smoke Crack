I make them good kids smoke crack
I make them good kids smoke
Good kids smoke (crack)
Good kids smoke (crack)

You take the pipe (the pipe)
Torch it, and give it a little twirl
It get's you high (now try)
Try to stay out of jail
'Cause just one rock couldn't kill no one
I've smoked since I was two years old

If you smoke crack
You might one day be president

I make them good kids smoke crack
I make them good kids smoke crack

Don't be hatin' on a brother 'cause I smoke with kids
I smoked with all your mothers when they was pregnant

I make them good kids smoke crack
I make them good kids smoke
Good kids smoke (crack, crack, crack)
Good kids smoke (crack, crack, crack)
Good kids smoke crack

You know my type
I'm a nice guy
Everybody likes me
White collar crimes
Killing white people nightly
I get high with twenty nine year olds
I mean, there's twenty of 'em playing outside nicely

I got the price of the crack
You might be surprised how it helps you relax
Well, I take it back
You'll be dancin' and askin' the crackers for cash when they pass

Now your mom's comin' at me for answers
"Why you smokin' crack with my grandson?"
I don't know
Why is the sky black?
I don't know
Why is this guy black?
Why do grandmas give me handjobs for crack?

I make them good kids smoke crack
I make them good kids smoke crack

You can take his bag of drugs and share with your friends
I could've charged you double
But I care 'bout your kids

I make them good kids smoke crack
Good kids smoke (good kids smoke crack, crack, crack)
Good kids smoke (crack, crack, crack)
Good kids smoke crack

The FCC's gonna take all my money
'Cause I'm teachin' kids to smoke the crack
But I'm not the one making songs teaching little girls how to take it in the ass
So please go and buy my CD for your kids
Even though I have a dirty mouth
'Cause when you were a kid
You were probably lynching my people in the south

I make them good kids smoke crack
Good kids smoke (good kids smoke crack)
Good kids smoke crack

Don't be hatin' on a brother 'cause I smoke with kids
I smoked with all your mothers when they was pregnant

I make them good kids smoke crack
I make them white girls go black
I make them good kids smoke
Good kids smoke (crack, crack, crack)
Good kids smoke (crack, crack, crack)
Good kids smoke
