Dear Santa
This yo little cousin, Rucka Rucka Ali
First, I wanted to tell you, what a good ass mo'fuckin' boy I been this year
I raised thirty-two dollars for Haiti
And a buck-fifty to help BP
What? A nigga needs some skittles

Anyway
For this year's Christmas
All I ask you
Is a pound of purple pot
The ability to seduce any bitch
And for my videos to stop gettin' deleted every motherfuckin' day

You give me the same bullshit every Christmas
And some shit I did not ask for, and don't need to be here!

And for this year
All I ask is for you to help a motherfuckin'
Brother out, for once

Ten seconds from you on the video blog
Talkin about, "yo quit deletin Rucka's shit"
Will come a long way with me, sir!

Fuck you!
I'm tired of your bullshit!
And don't not never ask me for nothin' again
If you don't come through this mo'fuckin' time

Merry fuckin' Christmas, bitch nigga!
FUCK YOU!
Sincerely
Rucka Rucka Motherfucka Ali

PS: Ain't no cookies out, ain't none for you
So keep your black ass out my cupboard, this year
PEACE!
