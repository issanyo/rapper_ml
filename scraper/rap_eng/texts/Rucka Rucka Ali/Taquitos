K? Aloha
You can
Call me Alejandro Whereizwaldo
Three time Latino Grammy winner
Two time political prisoner, Peru

South of Texas (is a place that's)
Called Mexico (Called Mehico)
And it goes from California to Brazil (Hell yeah)

They like nachos (And wear ponchos)
And play bongos (And like tacos)
And all other types of food from Taco Bell (I like those quesadillas)

Life is nice, south of the border
But they go to Arizona (Arizona)
To fall asleep in the truck on the lawn (that I payed them to mow!)

The Mexicans, are just the same as normal people
They brought cocaine here from the rainforests
That we stole from them (Give it back)
They all can read
They like to read, great works of literature
Like Malcolm X and The Fountain Head
And Where Is Waldo?

Taquitos
Twenty seconds in the microwave, that's all
Spicy chicken, jalepeno, taquitos
Makes the bitches and the hoes take off their clothes
Do the Samba
Ay caramba!
Taquitos (with salantro)
Get your diarrhea all over your clothes

Jalepenos
Here's a napkin
You can crap in

They were Mayans
And then Mexicans
And then Latins
Then back to Mexicans
And their calendar
Says that the world will end (in twenty-twelve)

So not to be racist
But it makes sense
That if they think the world will end
That some of them, don't never pay their bills (How's that racist? They're not even black)

Thank you, drive through, here's your order
Would you like two more, for quarter?
No thanks, I'll just have a cup of water
And Oh, yeah, this is all to go

The Mexican's land was taken
From them by the Gringos
If they'd been Indians
They'd been given small pox and casinos

Nacho Libre
Was kinda gay
I don't even like Jack Black
Well he's OK
But overrated, That's just me though

Taquitos
You can grab a couple extra for your bros
Let's take Sancho
To the gun show
Taquitos, black people are the best at the basketball
Alejandro, Whereizwaldo
Javier

Now you can see, man
Why I sing for revolucion in Argentina in Nicaragua
And Puerto Rico

You know that thing, they put on trucks, to make them shits look brand new
Yeah, well that thing
It has a name. It is bondo

The Mexicans, are no different than other types of people
They like to sit, out on the porch
Instead of drugs, they sell oranges

They all can read
They like to read, great works of literature
Like War & Peace, and Who Moved The Cheese?
And Where Is Waldo?

Taquitos
Twenty seconds in the microwave, that's all
I'm a Gringo, let's play bingo
Taquitos, with salantro and some packets of hot sauce
Habenero, for dinnero

The Mexicans, are just the same as normal people
They brought cocaine here from the rainforests
That we stole from them
They all can read
They like to read, great works of literature
Like Malcolm X and The Fountain Head
And Where Is Waldo?
