[Intro: Trump]

I am trump, a smart guy
Sold good clothes on Macy's line
This kid is cool, and I am fly
We’re good friends, Kim and I
Cause my dick's a good size
Kim Jong Un's, amazing guy
His small dick’s, smaller than mine

[Chorus: Trump]
We're good friends,
Kim and I
Kim and I

[Verse 1: Kim Jong Un]
I'm the new Kim Jong I'm the head of the tribe
Drop a nuclear bomb on the head of the Thai
There could be just one Korea at a time
Will South Korea get the idea or will one of us die? [Huh?]
I am child of Kim Jong Hitler
You tell me no blow shit up, it no sit well
I wanna blow up China and fuck Tibet
Nuclear war really get my dick wet
There is hunger, my people all suffer
No dog left, what we eat for supper?
We need kimchi, all we eat is rubber
Hand over your dog or we gonna have trouble
Got 10 tanks, I fire 10 blanks
I want all your food and the head of Tom Hanks
Everyone will know Kim Jong doesn't play games
Blow the whole fucking world up,
Bye kay thanks

[Prechorus: Trump]
Buy my socks and red tie
now at Nordstrom and Best Buy
Fuck J Crew, Calvin Klein
Wear my shit, or you will die
I met this kid, he seems nice
Kinda tough, he beats his wife
I'll show him a good time

[Chorus: Trump]
We're good friends,
Kim and I
Kim and I

[Verse 2: Kim Jong Un]
I Kim Jong, I give you a bit advice
You all die if I no get a bit of rice
I from Japan, so you know I could karate slice
Kung fu punch with a lemon and a bit of ice
I Kim Jong, no you ever forget it boy
I get drunk while watching the Incredibles
King Don, why you no grow a set of balls?
You're fired, that’s not a metaphor
Get on the ground bitch, fun time over
It’s going down bitch, yellow October
Goodbye Los Angeles, full city enclosure
It's getting radiation, thought you wanted the exposure
We do drug together, we eat pug together
Here come Korean winter, it not good weather, ya know?
Ching chong, it’s Kim Jong bitch
Un is short for: Until when is lunch special, 6?

[Prechorus: Trump]
I am Trump, a smart guy
The smartest one, I never lie
People say, Donald why,
are you so smart, you're always right
I just came here by flight
To meet this boy, some Asian guy
He's a good kid, please buy my tie

[Chorus: Trump]
We're good friends,
Kim and I
Kim and I

We’re good friends,
Kim and I
Kim and I

We're good friends,
Kim and I

[Bridge: Both alternating]
[Kim Jong Un]
Hope you all wanna die, here we go, Imma drop atom bomb on you and tear up your country I swear
Jihad Imma bomb-a you
If you American, sorry to bother you

[Trump]
Buy my suit, buy my tie, buy my shoes, buy my stuff, I got the greatest stuff ever I told you I'm gay

[Kim Jong Un]
We friend, I no bomb-a you
Do you like Korean barbecue

[Prechorus: Trump]
I don't get drunk, I don't get high
I just tell losers that eat rice
What to do, I'm in charge
I run shit, it is nice
Kim Jong Il was a bad guy
But his son Un, he seems nice
Buy my shit, it's in style

[Chorus: Trump]
We're good friends,
Kim and I
Kim and I

We're good friends,
Kim and I
Kim and I

We're good friends,
Kim and I
Kim and I
