[Intro]

And so I ask you
American people
To vote my ass
PRESIDENT,
please

Thank you, Dr Carson
Mr Trump,
Your turn to make a final statement

[Verse 1]

I was born in my own hospital
(A great hospital, the best you could imagine)
Delivered by the doctor that I bought
(And he thanked me, he said
"Donald, thank you"
"This is terrific")
I bought at least a couple wives
3 highest paid women in America
But the third one doesn't speak english just right
But she's great, I see her on holidays
Terrific

[Pre-chorus 1]

Now this country needs a good, strong leader
I'm real busy but I may just have the time
If I let you elect the Trumpster
You're welcome

[Chorus]

I'm a great leader and I can't read
We're bein' r**** by the Chinese
I'll make these China dogs my b******
I'm the filthy richest (We need a)
Hero that'll come help
I'll sell America to myself
I'll build youse
Highways and some bridges
I'm the filthy richest

[Verse 2]

I want to make this country great
(Right now we're NOT great)
But the Mexicans keep coming here to r***
(And by the way, at least rape in English)
I'll build a wall no-one could climb
(No-one will climb this wall)
And the Spics could r*** on their own f***** side
(Mexico is the new China)

[Pre-chorus 2]
Now I'm seein' people talk about Trumpster
Sayin' things that quite frankly aren't nice
When I'm in charge of our nuclear program
You're all bombed (And fired)

[Chorus]

I'm a great leader and I can't read
We're bein' r**** by the Chinese
I'll make these China dogs my b******
I'm the filthy richest (We need a)
Hero that'll come help
I'll sell America to myself
I'll build youse
Highways and some bridges
I'm the filthy richest

[Bridge]

We're losing, it's a catastrophe
I'll negotiate a better deal
I'll do a good job

We need a leader prez
That'll get us out of our debt
Help the people get lower wig prices

We need a leader prez
That'll get us rid of ISIS
Rip em' all to shreds
F***** towel heads

We need a leader prez
That'll get us drivin' Hybrids
Give us all some bread
With a side of Pez
And tell the Mexicans
And all the illegal migrants
Ya gotta get a license

[Chorus]

I'm a great leader and I can't read
We're bein' r**** by the Chinese
I'll make these China dogs my b******
I'm the filthy richest (We need a)
Hero that'll come help
I'll sell America to myself
I'll build youse
Highways and some bridges
I'm the filthy richest

[Outro]

And I just can't help all youse b******
I'm the filthy richest
It's gonna be terrific
Cuz I'm the filthy richest
