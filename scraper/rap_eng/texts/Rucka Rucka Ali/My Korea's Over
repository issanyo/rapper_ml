[Intro]
DJ Not Nice!
Back from the dry cleaners (Aww shit)
Rucka Rucka Ali, Big American Rapper
We the realest ninjas left in the game
You no never hear shit like this
We bring the bitches to the yard for barbecue eggroll

[Verse 1]
Oh herro, remember me?
Number 1 Korean dead Chinese
Now I'm a ghost, that's all folks
No more children in bed with me
I take train to Pyongyongyang
And I fall asleep and die from AIDS
Now I go shopping with Steve Jobs
And do bin Laden's dry cleaning

[Chorus 1]
My Korea's over (That's it for me)
Can't bomb Asia no more (Or Hawaii)
I can't get a boner (It's hard for me)
Say hello to my little bastard son
Hello to Kim Ching-Chang Un

[Verse 2]
I like dog, dog is nice
'Specially with pork fry rice
I like poodle with some noodle
Make sure his cooter is neutered
I sorry, pitbull bit you
Here's some sweet and sour Shih-Tzu
Look how my people cry to me
"Ah, boo-hoo, we want food!"
Oh, you so hungry, you want eggroll?
Don't blame me, I voted Pedro
There's enough food here for me
You could order some Chinee
(It looks like...)

[Chorus 2]
My Korea's over (That's it for me)
Can't bomb Asia no more (Or Hawaii)
Why does Black guy take your (Your stuff from me)
Say hello to my little bastard son
Hello to Kim Ching-Chang Un

[Verse 3]
Goodbye, my fellow Koreans
Think of me when you poop and peein'
I will watch over you
Hey Phillipines! Fuck both of you!
Now I kick it with Confucius
Smoke some crack and slap a few tits
Soon my son will drop the bomb on Vietnam
Oh look! It's gone!
I'm just tryna blow up China
Take a steak, rape a vagina
South Korea's about to see a
Ground Zero meet Hiroshima

[Chorus 3]
My Korea's over (That's it for me)
Can't bomb Asia no more (Or Hawaii)
I like banging homos (It's fun for me)
Say hello to my little bastard son
Hello to Kim Ching-Chang Un

[Bridge]
I may be dead
But the dream of a free Chinatown lives (forever)
I died from AIDS
And I probably got it from some children
(So you see, my son, you must be good leader
American black president can't even read, probably
Don't shoot me! PEARL HARBOR!)

[Chorus 4]
My Korea's over (That 's it for me)
Can't bomb Asia no more (Or Hawaii)
I can't get a boner (It's hard for me)
Say hello to my little bastard son
Hello to Kim Ching-Chang Un

My Korea's over (That 's it for me)
Can't bomb Asia no more (Or Hawaii)
I like Asian Joe bros (Ha ha he he!)
Say hello to my little bastard son
Hello to Kim Ching-Chang Un

[Outro]
(Oh, hello Michael Jackson!
I no see you since we do sleepover with Gary Coleman!
Let's go watch Home Alone Tokyo! We get sushi
Remember my son Un? You babysit him!
Now he's Dear Leader Of Korea!

Goodbye, Sarah Palin, I'll never forget that night...)
