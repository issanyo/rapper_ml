Verse 1
I walk up to the police
In Detroit city
And I'm like
"Excuse me officer, I'm tryn find some weed"
And he's like
"Shit, so are we! Why don't you roll with me? We're gonna go around pulling over some minorities"
"That's what I'm talking about"

Get up in the police ride, ride
Crack a forty ounce inside, side
Nigga, we be getting' high, high
Me and the cops rolling' around going' sixty
When we see a trick ass bitch
We gonna' tell a ho to drop them titties

Go cops, get the dogs
Let's go fuck with old folks
That's right, let's get high
And pull over black guys
Get buzzed
Smoke some drugs
Bitch, I'm rollin' with the fuzz, now

Po, po, po, po
Po, po, po, po

Smoke rocks!
With the cops
Let's go storm the barber shop
It sure is nice, being' white
"Haha, just kiddin' black guys!"

Waving guns
At some nuns
Bitch bend over
We the fuzz, ho

Po, po, po, po
Po, po, po, po

Verse 2

So we pull up the police car
Right up to KFC
And we're like
"Gimme a chicken sandwich and waffle fries for free!"
Unforgivable
But everyone ran out the store
And we're like
"Hey, come back here! I'm just hungry, I won't search you for no crack rocks, Nigga"
Now, that's just awful...

Get up out the police car, car
Police unleash the dogs, dogs
Dogs are chasing' people down the road, road!
Bark, bark, bark, bark!

Me and the cops driving' down uptown, town
Trying to find someone brown, brown
Pull over someone brown
Let's pull over someone brown

Go cops, get the dogs
Let's go fuck with old folks
That's right
Let's get high
And pull over black guys

Get buzzed
Smoke some drugs
Bitch I'm rollin' with the fuzz, now

Po, po, po, po
Po, po, po, po

Smoke rocks

Verse 3

They pull me over
And they're like
"Yo, my bad. I thought you were a black guy"
I said
"It's fine. You see I'm white. But I look black when I'm dancing"
They pull me over
And they're like
"Yo, my bad. I thought you were Indian"
I said
"What Kind? The 7/11 kind? Or the kind of Indian that goes 'who, who, oh, oh, oh, who"
The police said
"I honestly can't tell the difference!"

Go cops, get the dogs
Let's go fuck with old folks
That's right
Let's get high
And pull over black guys

Get buzzed
Smoke some drugs
Bitch I'm rollin' with the fuzz, now

Po, po, po, po
Po, po, po, po

Smoke rocks
With the cops
Let's go storm the barber shop
It sure is nice, being' white
Haha! Just kidding, black guys!

Waving guns
At some nuns
Bitch bend over we the fuzz, ho

Po, po, po, po
Po, po, po, po
