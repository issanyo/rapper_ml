A, one!
A, two!
A, you know what to do!

Imagine stealing people's songs
It isn't hard to do
Yeah if they dead!

If you are cold out
I know a place you bitches could warm up
At Chinaman gay little restaurant
I welcome you to here with my balls out
So come and eat my little eggroll now

Yeah, come in
Yeah, we're friends
Yeah, come in
Our pork is made in little-kid sweatshop

Oh, herro, come in!
Bring your dog
We'll watch him
You sit down, relax
How you want your dog, I-I-I mean you chicken cooked?

I'm the best ninja in this place
Ninja kick, bust on your face
You shoulda got a can of mace
Now your pregnant, and the kids has AIDS
DJ Not Nice goes to space
Why those spacemen dress like gays?

#1, Shields Up Engage!
Captain, there's some sort of Asian!

I'm Commander Keen, bitch!
I blow up your ship!
Tell your robot friend, he can suck my dick!
I'm a kung-fu spaceman, on vacation
Hand over the keys to your fuckin' spaceship!

That Muslim, space monster, just raped Alf in the nostril!
Call me Dark Baiter, son
I like the dark side of the porn!

I never go out
I like to sit and play World of Warcraft
My mother says go work at McDonalds
I told her she can suck on my gonads
So come and play with me if you know how

Yeah, come in
Yeah, we're friends
Yeah, come in
My Nuckas work for me, you don't know that?

Ahh, why you betray me?
I'm on you team!
You kill me for no reason!
Fuck you bitch!
It's Rucka's Nuckas, yeeeah!

I go down to Jersey Shore
I meet some short Italian whore
Me and her like the same stuff
Gymtan and drycleaning store

She says "I'm 16 and pregnant"
We get abortion and some breakfast
She says, "Now I want divorce"
So I enter her butthole by force

Fist pump! With Guido wops
All their grandpas are in the mob
I fuck all the TV teen moms
And I toss their babies off a building

I'm Asian
I was raised in, the Asian part of Beijing
Now Snookies in my basement
No more Jersey Shore sensation

I told all, my friends in the police, that I smoke rocks
They said "That's all you had to say"
And we rolled out
To find some Mexicans at the border
We smoked their crack, and let them in California

Yeah, come in
Yeah, we're friends
Yeah, come in
The Situation made some lasagna

Oh, good lasagna
How old are you? 35?
Oh, what you do?
Oh, you go to club, and fuck sluts?
Very nice!

I went to Chile, and got the miners out of the cave
We ate tacos, and took them home to the cave where they live
And Haiti, oh baby, you drivin' me so crazy
The way you shake it, makes me jizz myself in my Mercedes

They say that every lady wants a sexy Asian man
They pay me to rape them
Oh, you didn't want rape? That's okay!

I come from Vietnam
If this video's taken down
Them Nuckas will load it up, what's up?

If you are cold out
I know a place you bitches could warm up
At Chinaman gay little restaurant

I welcome you to here with my balls out
So come and eat my little eggroll now

Yeah, come in
Yeah, we're friends
Yeah, come in
Our pork is made in little-kid sweatshop

Take yo pants off [5x]
Take yo fucking pants off!
