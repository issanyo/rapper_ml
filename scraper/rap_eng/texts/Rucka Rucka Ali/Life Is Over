[Verse 1:]
Hey, life is like a box of tissues
You gonna cry before you get through, then you're dead
Maybe you'll find love and two or three friends
But I'll bet you want to be someone else
You want to be a star
The world's so shitty but you know you're smart
And you try so hard, but all you ever do is get so far
It's like you were set up from the top
But when life is over it stops

[Hook:]
So, baby, get the toaster, fill the bath tub with some water
Stick a metal kitchen fork inside a socket in the wall or
Turn your keys on in your Ford Focus
And as the garage door closes
This whole dead end life is over, this horrendous life is over
This horrendous life is over, this horrendous life is over

[Verse 2:]
You, waiting for someone to come and rescue
Everyone you know has left you, you are a stray
But hey, it's like that bling one eighty two song
Six months and your memory's gone, they'll forget you
The world broke your heart
Left you sitting here, broke down crying
And your fucked up arm looks like feelings that you can't get out
You might have a fresh start
But why's it always this hard?

[Hook:]
So, baby, get the toaster, fill the bath tub with some water
Stick a metal kitchen fork inside a socket in the wall or
Turn your keys on in your Ford Focus
And as the garage door opens
This whole dead end life is over, this horrendous life is over
This horrendous life is over, this horrendous life is over
So, baby, get the toaster, fill the bath tub with some water
Stick a metal kitchen fork inside a socket in the wall or
Turn your keys on in your Ford Focus
And as the garage door opens
This whole dead end life is over, this horrendous life is over
This horrendous life is over, this horrendous life is over
This horrendous life is over, this horrendous life is over
This horrendous life is over, this whole dead end life is over
This whole dead end life is over, this horrendous life is over
This horrendous life is over, but it ain't ever fucking over
It ain't ever fucking over, no, it ain't ever fucking over
