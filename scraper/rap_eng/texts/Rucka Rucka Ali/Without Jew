Yeah
They call me MC Meshuganah
Niggas walk up with some pork and I'm killin' 'em
This is my street
Up in Flatbush in Brooklyn

Seymour Schwartz
I'm a certified attorney
Look me up
I'm also a doctor
Drink vodka on Hanukkah
Me and my Schwartzes run from helicopters

I'm the most lactose intolerant
Gimme some cheese with my meat and I'm gonna fart
I'm about five-foot-two with my shoes on
Turn on the TV just to see what Jew is on
Chinese food, I need to get me some coupons
I eat soup with lots of balls on my conference calls
All the stocks are falling
I lost my retirement
I pin on my yarmulke and go fight Sharpton

Bitch, I fuck more bitches than that Madoff boy
Rucka Rucka Ali, sing the fuckin' chorus, man

Jew boy
Posted outside, spinning your dreidel
Sippin' on some grape juice
Rocking that Jew gold
The world just don't understand you
They try to kill all of you
But no one can sue ya'll
Too bad, 'cause you got, all the money

Catch me in my neighborhood temple where I pray
God, please, let me sell some diamonds on eBay
Usually I'm hungry, but now I need some money
So God, please give me couple bagels and a twenty
Twenty bagels with lots of cream cheese on the top
Gimme couple shots of Manischewitz on the rocks
It hits the spot
They should of never had Hitler done the Holocaust
Yo, I'm in the bakery
How much does that challah cost?
All across the trailer park, people hate Jews
I would too, if my father was my grandfather too

Fuck you
I hate you, you anti-Semite son of a bitch
If not for Jews, blue jeans wouldn't even exist
We invented lipstick and the atom bomb
So Lebanon could kiss they ass goodbye when we're bombing 'em
Please God, let there be peace in the Middle-East for once
And please let Iran bomb all these mothafuckas

Third verse could be worse than the first couple
It could put you to sleep
Or it could be controversial
Shoot us!
I'm tired of all you so-called Jewish MC's
You're dumb as shit
Choosin' hip-hop over [?]
Suck my schmickle!

Fuck you bitches badder than Mel Gibson fucks shit when he's wasted
Or Louie's on stage, blamin' Jews for the slave trade
I hate you
I'll probably get killed for sayin' all this by the same guys that killed Malcolm X
But I don't give a shit
I won't throw my people down the steps like you faygolas
Can't we all be friends?

Jews and blacks are so much the same
We both been oppressed
We both got crazy mothers
And we're scared of them
We both like chicken
We both got weapons
Jews got Jewish guilt, blacks got handguns
Manischewitz got you actin' a meshugana
Everybody have a happy fuckin' Rosh Hashanavah

Jew boy

Eh, looks like we 'bout at the end of the song over here
This song wasn't too bad
Eh, I've heard better
But look , you tried your best
It's OK
[?]
You know how much my bar mitzvah
Who sang this song in the first place?
Chase?
J-A-Y-S, am I right?
Chase, am I sayin' it right?
He's a good rapper
He likes college, that's good
