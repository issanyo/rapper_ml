YouTube took my number one video down
Damn, how
Tell my why you suspend my account
Damn, why
I come on a boat from red China
Cause they won't
Give me free speech talk
I come to America and get some turntables
And play my song
Outside drycleaning stores
And everyone liking me
And they dance, so i say OK
I'll make a video for my song
Ching Chang Chong
And it was the number one in the USA
But suddenly one day the video wasn't there
And YouTube told me that they decide to
Take my hate song down
Cause people complaining
They think i hate asians
What kinda pussy can't tell im a clown
Clown, damn
YouTube take my number one song down
Damn, how
I think they still mad about Vietnam
It's not hate speech
Come on it's listed under comedy
Why you take my song away
Don't you know laughter is the best medicine
Except if you have aids
Why you take Ching Chang Chong from me
It's not nice to take it away
You take Ching Chang Chong away
If you spent some time with me
You would see that i'm OK
So let me tell you about me
My dog i Alaskan
My friend is a black man
My wife is a dyke and
I love everybody in the whole world
If you think i'm racist
Well you just can't face it
That black people just like me
More than you
Yeah
How about that
You just mad cause i have
More black friends
Than you
(Little wayne is in the house
Everybody come on)
Damn why they gotta be
Mad about some comedy
I'm thinking YouTube owes
Rucka a apology
Nailed him to a cross
With a form of cyber sodomy
We call that Severe Vaginitus
In psychology
Rucka's got it rough
He got his bullshit taken off
All you meshuganas at Youtube
Got a chopstick in your butt
What the hell's your fucking problem
Your just jockin Rucka's cock
Cause he got Weezy F Baby
On this song for free
You all dunno me, Weezy's my homie
So you all can blow me
Cause i don't care if you take my song down
You think i'm from China
But check my vagina
Cause i lied i'm really from Japan
Yeah, what's up
I don't care if you suspend my account
Fuck you
(I'm about to rock. Right Weezy?)
(Yeah hehe)
I don't care if you delete my video!)
I have so many people who will reload it in
Various places where you cannot control
I have an Army of Small Children working in the sweatshop
Every single day
Buy my song on iTune and Amazon dot com
Thank You, Come Again
