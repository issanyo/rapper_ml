1st in school they are told their gender
Then the boys get shoes and the girls in the kitchen
And they stay there
80% of pay there
Next thing boys are told they could rape
And they're split up in colours and the blacks in cages
And they stay there
Tell OJ I said hey there

And the token
Is allowed to do
What they told him
Give him glassed
And then they throw him
Couple passes
To go see Black Panther
Hamilton, watch it with Carlton
And if they're gay
They're getting carded, sent away
For pissing off God
If you are tired
Of all of this garbage
Then say

Rape
She says she gotten rape
And I believe her
Believe her
Rape
She says she got paid less
And I believe her
Believe her
Hey
All men commit some fuckin type of rape
Forget the fuckin trial it's o-
Kay
She tells me I just raped her
I believe her
Believe her

Words in church and the prayer and the funs
And the love are trained by the gas corporations
In the bubble
The shit is fuckin subtle

Coca-cola
Is a brand
That brought the blacks over
For a plan
They gave us the Hovas
And the Kans
To sell us headphones
And baggy pants
And they tell us what shit is the shizzle to get
And they get all the money we spent on the shit
And they chain down Kanye, down like

Rape
She says she gotten rape
And I believe her
Believe her
Rape
She tells me that she's funny
I believe her
Believe her
Hey
The whites are tryna rape your fuckin face
So grab a fuckin torch and let's go
Rape
She says she fuckin raped me
I believe her
Believe her

Smoking crack at the top of Trump Tower
Couple Newport packs for Barack Hussein Obama
And the Hildog
She always kept it real dog

And it never will
Until everyone knows
That the men in the pen
Are just training for a day
When they break out
And Rape

Rape
She raped me I, she raped me I
Believe her
Believe her
Rape
Don't test the fuckin rape kit
I believe her
Believe her
Rape
All men are fucking guilty or they're gay
So put them on a train and let's all
Rape
She raped me I, she raped me I
Believe her
Believe her
