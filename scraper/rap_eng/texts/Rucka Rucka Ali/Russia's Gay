[Hook 1]
Russia's gay
In it everyone has AIDS
And they all got it from buttsex
Their president fingerbangs them little kids

[Verse 1]
I wait so long in the snow for one little piece of bread
And I have been drunk since I was born and I keep Mongolians in a cage
I'm poor, I sold my child for a sip of vodka
My wife is named Svetlana Borshtynskovskiska
At my space station we try to send a cardboard box up into the sky
When the wall came down and them Russians rushed out it was a day when freedom won
If Mr. Putin wants to invade Georgia, we'll be waiting here with guns
I live in Atlanta

[Hook 2]
Russia's gay
They suck a lot of long dicks
On the Internet, Russia's gay
They like to touch on young boys a little bit
[Hook 1]

[Verse 2]
I eat sour dough, it no good, I have never seen a real black man
And I have ten kids I can't feed, I hope we fight a nuclear war
Da, I hope I eat a piece of fish for dinner
We have a wall to keep my people in here
The KGB arresting me cause they catch me touching myself
Tell the troops right now, time to bomb Moscow, fun time and games are done
We should kill them Ruskis and take their land cause it's far from Mexico
This one's for 9/11

[Hook 3]
Russia's gay
It looks like Candyland
And the palace is plastic
They wear those dumb fucked up hats with fur on it
[Hook 1]

[Verse 3]
Hey, let me tell you right now, them Russians ain't gonna take Vietnam
Not without me in charge
I got a mail order bride, came here in a box from Petersburg
She left her fucking kid to starve
Hey, Mr. Obama, get your club and go have a word with Medvedev
Get him good in the chest
And tell Mr. Ching Chang Chong if he wants to get involved
All your missiles won't add inches to your penis
When the wall came down and them Russians rushed out it was a day when freedom won
But then when David Hasselhoff started singing on cars they were putting the wall back up
Cause baby Russia's fucking gay

[Hook 1] (x2)
