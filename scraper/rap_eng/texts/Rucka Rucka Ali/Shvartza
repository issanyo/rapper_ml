[Verse 1]
Hear a knock on the door, it's the cops again
(We know you're in there)
Said hold on could I finish my Chicken
(almost done with this bucket)
They said we got a report that you did some shit
(SHHHHHEEEEEEEEIIIITT)
I said "please officer, let me explain"
(I'm a splain you)
You see I'm a Black man
In Arabic they call me Abed
It's Mooley in Italian
But if you ask the Jews how to say
It
They'll say

[Hook 1]
I am a Shvartza
Playin Magic Cardsa
Throwin me some Dartsa

Wish upon a Startza
Swingin round my gun

[Verse 2]
Police took me to Jail where I stayed all day

Vaole zwetzak in Flemish

And the way to say it in

Watching Bill Maher
And I keep gettin my ass beat
By the Jail Guards

[Outro]
(And so I ask you American people to vote my ass President)
