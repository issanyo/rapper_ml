[Verse 1]
I'm not a racist guy
I wanna make that clear
I just hate Obama's
Treatment by the media

[Verse 2]
Coons, spics 'n' ayrabs
Kykes 'n' chinks
Are all words I don't want people using when they speak

[Verse 3]
I don't like them black folk songs
I prefer rap, yo
Blacks are more likely to murder
Bars and rhymes on a track

[Verse 4]
Arab Indians from Turkey
Smell like fuckin' Curry's
Awesome new cologne
I could use some, in fact
(whoo, here we go)

[Verse 5]
I don't like them Sunnis (oh)
Bein' profiled all the time (uh-oh)
Don't let 'em on the airplane
'Til you wish 'em a Happy Ramadan
(enjoy your flight)

[Verse 6]
Jews took my money
To the bank for me (Thanks!)
I was busy teaching Mexicans
English muffin recipes (yee-haw)

[Verse 7]
I don't like them black folks
Bein' show by bad pos
Black lives don't matter
To people like the Klan (sure don't)

[Verse 8]
I don't like them Persians
Bein' mistaken for other versions (please)
These guys invented agriculture
In ancient Iran

[Verse 9]
I'm not racist
I like black people
Everyone should own oneâ€¦ tool set
To build a fence around your house
And keep out all them dirty, fuckin' nagging mormons

[Verse 10]
I'm not racist but
Asians are Nerds
Strom Rack shoppers (which is smart)
I don't like curds

[Verse 11]
Too much cheese on 'em
Cholesterol's too high
And I wish that every Armenian would
Direct me to a Kabob store

[Verse 12]
I hate them black folk
Bein' given bad loans
Blacks should get the same interest rate as any white man

[Verse 13]
Fuckin' Mexicans are dirty
Rich from selling great verde
Trump should build a Walt Disney park to thank them
(that's right)

[Verse 14]
I'm not racist but
Some black guy broke in my Vans

[Verse 15]
Thanks, bruh
They were, they were too tight on my feet, yeah
Got Asians in here, that's good!
I look forward to praising their superior math skills
While harboring no stereotypes about their statistical rate of driving accidents

[Outro]
This one's for The South
Will Rise Against
Be playing any shows here in the near future?
I appreciate their progressive message
Plus most the audience will be white collar workers there among working class everyday folks
I just hope nobody there's a fagg- (*beep*)
