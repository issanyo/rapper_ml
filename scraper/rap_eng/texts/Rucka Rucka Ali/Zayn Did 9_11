Zayn Hussein did 9/11

Zayn is the lead singer of the group Al Qaedirection
He flew a plane into some buildings on September the 11th
He was 8 or 9
He trained how to fly
Took a boxcutter, went onto a plane
He was 8 or 9
He made up his mind
He hates our way of life and then he did 9/11

Zayn did 9/11
(what?)
Yeah I said it
He gave his own father, Bin Laden, all the credit
Attention passengers, we got a little setback
I can't tell if this kid's a Pakistani or a wetback
He just came inside
Waving his knife
Telling me to fly into the trade centre
I'd stay and fight
But this day looks nice to skydive
So baby here comes 9/11

This song
Will get people mad at me
But I know they won't talk correcticly
They'll be like
"YOU ARE SO STUPED ZAYN DON'T TERRRIST I HATE YOU"
"Leave Zayn alone, he didn't made you anything"
"You are stupid! Zayn insult only to find more fame, because you do not, you fucking"
