[Intro]
Because you know we all should talk about race about race
Don't be scared we could talk about race about race
Come on who cares?
Let's all talk about race about race
It's about time we all just talk about race about race

[Verse 1]
The white race has no rhythm and isn't very cool
The black race is faster and never stays in school
There's many Asian races or that's just what they clam
They all look the same
They all just look the same
The German race is mean, they don't know when to stop
It took over the Polish race, they had to call the cops
The Jewish race is smart but not the most athletic
If it's to close to the Arab race you better call a medic

[Pre-Chorus]
Obama's of multiple races but mostly black
That's why he runs so good in his campaign like he smoked some crack
And all the folks of the white race wonder how he runs so well
It's all them African genes, you can't buy them you're born with them

[Chorus]
So let's all talk about race about race
Don't be scared we all could
Talk about race about race, especially you know that one certain race
It's about time we all talk about race about race

[Verse 2]
Wait what?
There is no good and bad
Everyone's special in a different way
So don't you ever judge another race and everyone will run at there own pace (That's clever)
There so much drama with race every day it's around-the-clock
If someone says something about race you know they could lose their job
If you don't like certain races you best keep it to yourself
I'd like to see American Indian race but there's none left (Whoops)

[Chorus]
So let's all talk about race about race, why can't we all just finally talk about race about race
Cause all we ever fucking talk about is race about race
So let's all finally fuckin' talk about race about race

[Outro]
I think we all should really talk about race about race, and all share our feelings
Talk about race about race
It's time that everybody
Talk about race about race
So let's just everybody
Talk about race about race
