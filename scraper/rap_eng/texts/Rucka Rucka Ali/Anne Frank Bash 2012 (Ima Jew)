Yo, listen up
Here's a story
About a little girl who lived in an attic
And all day and all night
Them Nazi soldiers were lookin' for her
And she sang a little something like this

I'm a Jew, homie we gonna die
Yo, get the keys to the ride
Homie, we gotta fly
We gotta flee
Come on I, got me some rocks
I got some weed in my socks
Homie, we gettin' high

Yeah
I gotta army lookin' for me
And this attic's gettin' too crowded for me
Gotta go get a bus outta Germany
Gotta rush, 'cause if them Nazis find me
Then it's on to the train and off to the camp
And it's not the kind of camp where you wanna be
It's not the kind of camp with arts and crafts
It's the kind where they make soap outta me

This attic's gettin' too whack for me
All I got is a bucket to crap and pee
It sucks when you're stuck in the attic, B
Ain't even got cable on this TV

And my little laptop's got dial-up
How'm I s'posed to see "Two Girls, One Cup"?
And I can't make a call to order some grub
Ain't even got service on my Blackberry

Hitler, might as well give up
'cause I ain't comin' down
And I ain't gonna be found
It's my Bat Mitzvah
We gonna get drunk
And get this attic bumpin' down
Everybody sing it now!

I'm a Jew, homie we gonna die
Yo, get the keys to the ride
Homie, we gotta fly
We gotta flee
Come on I, got me some rocks
I got weed in my socks
Homie, we gettin' high

Hey, yo!

Why them Nazis waste their time on me?
I'mma tryn'a chill with my homie
It's fine, don't pay no dime
I'mma be just fine, but keep on tryna' find me
Kinda started, I liked this attic
It's not bad
I ain't even mad
It's rad
I'mma have me a little party
Manichewitz, instead of Bacardi

And you're all invited
Bring your posse
You ain't gettin' carded
We all gonna get retarded
We gonna drink until we fart it

And we gonna order pizza
We gonna be hiring a DJ
We gonna sing "Hava Nagila"
We gonna be smoking our kilo

This ain't something you wanna miss, man
This gonna be a sweet Bat Mitzvah
We gonna be in the VIP
And we might even be throwing a bris

Bitch Ass Nazis ain't invited
They try to get in, don't bother
This party, it can be one of a kind
Anne Frank Bash, 2009!

I'm a Jew, homie we gonna die
Yo, get the keys to the ride
Homie, we gotta fly
We gotta flee
Come on I, got me some rocks
I got weed in my socks
Homie, we gettin' high

I'm in an attic, an attic
It's so sweet, it's so sweet
I'm in an attic, an attic
It's so sweet, it's so sweet
I'm in an attic, an attic
It's so sweet, it's so sweet
I'm in an attic, an attic
It's so sweet, it's so sweet

(Attic, an attic
It's so sweet, it's so sweet)
(Attic, an attic
It's so sweet, it's so sweet)
(Attic, an attic
It's so sweet, it's so sweet)
(Attic, an attic
It's so sweet, it's so sweet)

I'm a Jew, homie we gonna die
Yo, get the keys to the ride
Homie, we gotta fly
We gotta flee
Come on I, got me some rocks
I got weed in my socks
Homie, we gettin' high

I'm a Jew, homie we gonna die
Yo, get the keys to the ride
Homie, we gotta fly
We gotta flee
Come on I, got me some rocks
I got weed in my socks
Homie, we gettin' high
