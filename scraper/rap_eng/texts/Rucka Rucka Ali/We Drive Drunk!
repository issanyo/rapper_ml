[Verse 1]
Excuse Me
Please get out my way
I'm driving me a little drunk
Buzzed drivin is drunk drivin
So might as well get really crunk
I had a 5th of Popov and
I topped it of with a little Jag
I had a Margarita
And licked all the salt off which is gay
I had me a couple pints of Captain Mo
And ain't hardly feelin' nothin' yet
Had a little drink of Jimmy Beam
I think I might be seein' things
Who the Hell is under my corvette?
And as I drive
I crack open
A beer and chug it down
And I can't see the road

[Chorus]
Tonight
We Drive Drunk
Rollin' wasted in the pontiac
With some Cognac
And some Rum
Tonight
We Drive Drunk
So I just might kill your father
And your mother
And your son

[Verse 2]
Get rolled by the cops
They ask have
You got
A beer to spare?
Yea right here
Got half a case of Rollin Rock
Said let's do a toast
We did 2 of those
He said you look drunk
So head on straight home

[Chorus]
Tonight
We Drive Drunk
Rollin' wasted in the pontiac
With some Cognac
And some Rum
Tonight
We Drive Drunk
So I just might kill your father
And your mother
And your son

[Bridge]
Driving Drunker than a Lohan
Sipping Rum and Coke and
Pissing in a Coke Can
Speedometer's Broken
(Driving Drunk Tonight)
Sipping on Bacardi
(Driving Drunk Tonight)
Winning like I'm Charlie
(Driving Drunk Tonight)
Listening to Marley
(Driving Drunk Tonight)
Watching Some iCarly

[Verse 3]
Coulda Taked the Bus
And Gone Safely Off
Coulda Raped a Slut
Or stayed at home
And taken Drugs
But I'm Drivin' Drunk
With Hoes in The Trunk
And if I see Trayvon
I'm Drivin him home

[Chorus]
Tonight
We Drive Drunk
Rollin' wasted in the pontiac
With some Cognac
And some Rum
Tonight
We Drive Drunk
So I just might kill your father
And your mother
And your son

[Verse 4]
And as I drive
I crack open
A beer and chug it down
I can't see the road
Tonight
