The year is 1997
The world is a much different place
The war between man and machine has begun
Skynet began the war by dropping a nuclear bomb on the Soviet Union
Followed by the remainder of Europe
And finally, New Jersey
Ninety-five percent of the humans were killed in the battle, as well as some hippies
Only one man can save the human race from certain extinction
And doom
That man is a noble, generous, and caring individual
Also known as "Rucka Rucka Ali"
