[Intro]

We now return to Celebrity Apprentice
Now Lil Jon, why you think ya team lost?
WHAT?
You're supposed to be this great rapper
How'd you lose a rap battle with the deaf bitch?

[Verse 1: Obama]

My fellow Americans
I have, uh, some shit to tell you
I know one president
Getting some anal from Michelle
Bitch, I got him
Saw Bin Laden out in Pakistan
Shot him in the dome and told him
There you go
I got him yo
Solved a fuckin' problem, Joe
Let's break out the Hennessy
Everybody smack a bitch around from here to Tennessee
Now let us see which durka durka wants another round from me
Thought I told you crackers
You don't wanna fuck around with me

[Verse 2: Osama Bin Laden]

Ay, bro, recognize me?
I look like the durky
Selling you a slurpee
So much noise about me
Everybody judge me
No one ever loves me
They say
That I'm dead
But they don't even know
I work at liquor store
They test my DNA
'This says Kareem Abdul Jabbar'
'Yeah, that's him'
I drive a cab in New York
I did 9/11
I fight for Jihad
Al-Qaeda give me discount card

[Hook: Obama]

Bitch, please
B-b-bitch, please
Get off your fuckin' camel
Get your fuckin' sandals
Taking
We're t-t-taking
All your fucking countries
From you fucking monkeys

[Bridge: Osama Bin Laden]

Bro
I'm from Africa
I come from Baghdad
The Jews took my cologne
I smell like a dog

[Verse 3: Barack Obama]

'Mr. President, who should we blow up next?'
Well, I know Prince William
He livin' like a king
He don't do shit
He just sit and get shit for free
How the hell are you gon' let him pay his wedding
With the money he took from you, motherfucker
Let him pay for it
What a bunch of pale, cross-bred
Yeah, they all fail
One of them is dead
And the others should be all in jail
Oh, Prince Charles
Livin' large
But your mum in charge
Fuck you William
And tell the Queen
To slob all on my knob

[Verse 4: The Queen]

We're all
Livin' like kings
Raping all the peasants
Taking all their presents
So much nice things
We could have it all
We take it from the poor (hee hee)
They say we're inbred
I gotta fuck me cousin
Take a look at London
They mad
They want bread
But they can eat me ass poo (laughter)

[Hook: Obama]

Bitch, please
B-b-bitch please
Take off the fuckin' crown and
Blow your fuckin' man bitch
Hey Queen
H-h-hey Queen
Get off the fuckin' horse and make a fuckin' sandwich

[Bridge: Bin Laden]

Bro
Fuck you William
And fuck your fat whore
Bitch, you can suck my balls
I fuck you by force

[Verse 5: Donald Trump]

Hello, my name is Donnie Trump (Donnie Trump)
I make a billion every time I take a dump (take a dump)
I don't need to win the White House
I'll just buy it (buy it)
I bought the Taliban
And told Osama that he's fired (fired)
Now I'm a smart guy
What the hell's this Royal Wedding?
I bought the palace
And I'll move in when I'm fuckin' ready (ready)
So when you see the Prince of England
Stare and point and say
'Ay, you got some free shit bozo' (you got some free shit)
You got some free shit
Free shit
IT'S FREE SHIT!

[Hook: Donald Trump]

Bitch, please
B-b-bitch please
Get all ya fuckin' boys and
Watch my fuckin' show, yeah
Taking
We're t-t-taking
All ya fuckin' oil
Yeah bitch, O'Doyle rules!

[Bridge: Bin Laden]

Bro
I'm from Africa
Don't fuck with my bros
My crew's from Mexico
I blow myself up

[Verse 6: Barack Obama]

My fellow Americans
Today Osama Bin Laden was found
At a 7-11 in Pakistan, Ohio
I greeted him there myself
With a birthday card
As I haven't seen him in over 10 years
I asked him to come to my daughter's birthday party
He declined, so I shot him
In the face
Myself!
We can all rest assured
That Michelle will be giving me a blowjob tonight
With her mouth this time

[Outro]

Am I really the first black man that has to convince people I killed somebody?
Michelle, what's that smell?
