Dinner's running late behind, so I hit a bitch in the eye
I told her once, then I tell her twice, now get the ice
You fucked up my rice!

Told a bitch to get me some snacks, she must've thought I said "go relax"
I took my belt off and whooped her ass
Then took a bath, smoking my pipe...

Smacking my bitch, let a bitch know
Smacking her cheek when she burning the toast
Smacking that ho, with all my might
Shut that bitch up, when she's supposed to be quiet!

Smack. My. Bitch
Nah, don't be talking back, I ain't got time for that!
Smack. My. Bitch
Girl, what you talkin' 'bout? Just shut your fucking mouth!

G-grew up on the rough side of town
I looked up to men like Chris Brown
I saw my momma get smacked around
My father's brown, he's younger than me!

I told the bitch all of my demands
Make some sammiches for ya man!
I ate too many and crapped my pants, then swung my hand
I smack her and sing...

Smacking my bitch, let my fist go
Smashing her teeth like a ten-n-is pro!
Smacking that ho, sippin' High Life
Did you forget I want food before five?

Smack. My. Bitch
I don't mean shootin' smack, it does mean also that...
(I smack my bitch in Hollywood)
Smack. My. Bitch
I don't be smokin' crack, cause drugs are fucking bad!
(Drugs are bad, m'kay?)

You... left the TV... on Honey Boo Boo!
Sunday at 9, on TLC!

Smacking my bitch, smacking my ho
Smacking my trick, just to let our love grow
One I hope, I'll make her my wife
And smack my bitch up, for the rest of my life!

Smacking my bitch, smacking my ho
Smacking her cheek when she burning the toast
Smacking that ho, with all my might
Shut that bitch up, when she's supposed to be quiet!

Smack. My. Bitch
Nah, don't be talking back, I ain't got time for that!
Smack. My. Bitch
Girl, what you talkin' 'bout? Just shut your fucking mouth!

Smacking my bitch, let my fist go
Smashing her teeth like a ten-n-is pro!
Smacking that ho, sippin' High Life
Did you forget I want food before five?

Smack. My. Bitch
I don't mean shootin' smack, it does mean also that...
(I smack my bitch in Hollywood)
Smack. My. Bitch
I don't be smokin' crack, cause drugs are fucking bad!
