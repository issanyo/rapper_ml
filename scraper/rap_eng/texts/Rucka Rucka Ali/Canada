Hello
This is a public service announcement from the Government of Canada
The Canada is what happens when you put French people in the woods
Ha ha

Canada
Is only there till they do something we don't like
I'd like to see them start a fight some day
We'd probably beat them to the ground by 6AM, eh

Across the bridge
Them lumberjacks are pulling syrup out of trees
They try to talk but all they know is French
Their claim to fame is being north of the US, yes

In Canada
The eskimos all seem to be frozen in time
And no one knows just who their leaders are
All of them hosers have a leaf for a flag, fa-a-a-ags

Canada
Is only there till they do something we don't like
I'd like to see them run their mouth at us one day
They'd probably be wiped off the map that very night, ni-i-i-ight

Yo it's cold
The royal police riding horses fighting crime
They funny hats and pants demand respect
Just break the law and you'll be fine if you can drive, dri-i-i-ive

I hate the queen
They ruined basketball with a Toronto team
They all statistically have smaller boobs
Gained independence from the queen in '82, 1982

Canada
Is kinda cold, a bomb could be kind of nice
They ruined bacon and they harvest ice
They hit baby seals and that ain't nice, not not not nice

Canada
Is only there till they do something we don't like
I'd like to see them start a fight some day
They're only there till they do something we don't like, li-i-i-ike

Homos
Seems like we should be telling them what to do
The metric system isn't very cool
Them park rangers wanna take care of a moose, moo-oo-oo-oose

Michael J. Fox
Your shaky ass ain't made a movie that I liked
Ok, I guess Back to the Future was okay
But Bryan Adams should have
But Bryan Adams should have
But Bryan should have stayed in

Canada
The eskimos all seem to be frozen in time
And no one knows just who their leaders are
All of them hosers have a leaf for a flag, fa-a-a-ags

Canada
Is kinda cold, a bomb could be kind of nice
They ruined bacon and they harvest ice
They hit baby seals and that ain't nice, not not not nice

Canada
Is only there till they do something we don't like
They're only there till they do something we don't like
They're only there till they do something we don't like
