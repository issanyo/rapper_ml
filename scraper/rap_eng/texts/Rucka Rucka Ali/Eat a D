[Verse 1]
There's a gay old man with the facts
Everyday he's there with attacks
He needs something to get mad at
Disgusting, we need to talk about it

[Pre-Chorus]
That homosexual is a Philly D
Dumb face, beady eyes
He makes a million bucks in a fuckin' week
And pretends he's just getting by

[Chorus]
Eat a fucking D, Philly D, Philly D
Philly, just eat a D
Eat a fucking D, Philly D, eat a D
Phil's got a little D
He wants guys in him, not women
Everybody agrees
Eat a fucking D, Philly D, Philly D
Philly eat a fuckin' D

[Verse 2]
If Phil doesn't fuckin' like
What you did then you're gonna fuckin' die
And he is the guy that will decide
You suffered enough for a second try
Deep down he is afraid of
Showing us his hate of
People and humanity
Just another Adolf
Wannabe dictator
Niggerfaggot splash of pee

[Chorus]
Eat a fucking D, Philly D, Philly D
Philly, just eat a D
Eat a fucking D, Philly D, eat a D
Phil's a fucking Nazi
He wants guys in him, he likes women
Or so we're meant to believe
Eat a fucking D, Philly D, Philly D
Philly eat a fuckin' D

[Post-Chorus]
Are you gonna cry, Philly?
Cry with me
Tell me that you love me
I hope you're alright with me
You might get me
Lynched by internet police

[Bridge]
I'll pass this to you
Please let us know
What do you think
Leave a comment below

[Outro]
Eat a fucking D, Philly D, Philly D
Philly, just eat a D (sing it boys)
Eat a fucking D, Philly D, eat a D
Phil's a fucking Chinee (let's go)
Do you wanna fight with me?
Spend the night with me?
I'll show you how it ought to be (yeah)
Eat a fucking D, Philly D, Philly D
Philly eat a fuckin' D
Hope your butt is tight Philly
Hold tight Billy
I'm gonna make you believe
Eat a fucking D, Philly D, Philly D
Better get on your knees
(Please!)
