[Verse 1]
Never been up Inside of any man
I've always thought
My dick as meant for girls
But I just had sex with guys
Now I know what his ass is like
Told you be gentle
When you stick your dick
In myself

{Hook}
Don't come in me
Please pull out instead
Don't come in me
Now I'm thinkin'

{Chorus}
Am I gay?
Am I gay?
I guess
I have semen in my hands
In my ass
On my Penis

{Verse 2}
I heard that HIV is contagious
But I heard it's only gay
If you lick their butt
This guy i met outside
Said wanna do it once or twice
And then his dick got long
Over and Over
His boner was hittin' mine

{Hook}
Don't come in me
Please spit on my chest
Pull out of me
Now I'm thinkin'

{Chorus}
Am I gay?
Am I gay?
I guess
I have semen in my hands
In my ass
On my Penis

{Verse 3}
I don't like men
I really isn't gay
I blowed a man once
But not two
Was never even bi

{Hook}
Don't come in me
Please pull out instead
Don't come in me
Now I'm thinkin'

{Chorus}
Am I gay?
Am I gay?
I guess
I have semen in my hands
In my ass
Again

[Chorus]
Now I'm thinkin'
Am I gay?
Am I gay?
I guess
