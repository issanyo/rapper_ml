They talk like
Hello, G'Day, mate!
I'm so much smarter than people in the United States
Let's start a party
Throw some shrimp on the barbie
Oh, poppycock! Now I must use the potty!
Have we ever told you all about how me shite country got started
To help you understand why we're all half-retarded
We got dropped off, on a boat from England
See, we're a bunch of criminals
It's in our DNA, friend!
The black people here, are Aborigines
They didn't know they're black, 'till they got a 50 Cent CD
We celebrate summertime sometime around February
We freed the Aborigines sometime around 2003

Yeah, uh huh
You know what it do
Everybody there fuck kangaroo

Yeah, uh huh
Stupid ass country
Ladies there, shave not, down under

Ain't nobody scared of Australians anyway
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia

They'll never know about this song, they're so far away
So fuck Australia
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia

They got a neighbor, and his name is New Zealand
Nobody cares about them
They're Canadian
They got some Indians, Aboriginals
They live in tents, with no pants on
You can see their balls

I hope Steven falls, into a pile of stingrays
And he could take Dundee with him, 'cause that sucker be gay
But I guess it don't matter 'bout Australia's gay shit
When it's gettin' taken over by the fuckin' Asians!

Yeah, uh huh
You know what it do
Everybody there fuck kangaroo

Yeah, uh huh
Stupid ass country
Ladies there, shave not, down under

Ain't nobody scared of Australians anyway
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia

They'll never know about this song, they're so far away
So fuck Australia
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia

I stay as far way as I could from you
'Cause them koalas will attack
Koala bears remote-controlled by Jews
And when I'm droppin' Huxtables at the pool
I got me a handfuls of Aussie conditioning shampoo
And I'm thinkin' 'bout skeetin' on Natalie, cover Kylie with goo
Nicole kidding me, sayin' that the carpet matches the drapes
And Mel Gibson dunno shit about punching fucking tricks in the taint!

Yeah, uh huh
You know what it do
(This racist song only shows how ignorant Americans are...)

Yeah, uh huh
You know what it do
(Whatever, man, at least Hitler ain't from Amurrica!!!)

Ain't nobody scared of Australians anyway
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia

They'll never know about this song, they're so far away
So fuck Australia
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia
Fuck Australia

You know what it do
Everybody there fuck kangaroo

Stupid ass country
Ladies there shave not down under

Ain't nobody scared of Australians anyway
