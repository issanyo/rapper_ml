What's up, bitches?
This Rucka Rucka Ali
I'd like to talk to you about some of the things that people have been saying about me
Such as that I am racist
Or that what my music is, is hate speech
Video hosting sites shutting my shit down
News reports
High school principal saying that my shit is "probably racist"
And today, I wanna talk to you, the victims, those who have been offended
Those who got made fun of in their school because they're a different color
Or that they're a different race
Or that their from some aspectual country where kids make fuckin' shoes, or...
Like one guy owns the whole fucking country
You know where you're from

I'd like to apologize
And announce that I'm retiring
No more music
No more parodies
No more full nude pictures of me
Nothing, I'm done!
So if I have offended you or hurt you in any way
Please accept my apologies
Goodbye

LIKE HELL, THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN!
You think I sat on my ass, and got this budget so I could quit?
FUCK that shit!
Do you know who the fuck I am?
Rucka Rucka Ali!

I got fans, in countries where bitches can't even drive!
Bitches can't drive in any country!
You sittin there cryin'? "I got offended by it"
Yeah, well, fuck you!
I'm tired of your bullshit!
I just doin' my own fuckin' thing!
I just holdin' up a mirror to myself, and seein' a black ass MOTHERFUCKER!!
"Oh, but what if my kids hear it?"
DAMN RIGHT, you kids gonna hear it!
I am trying to raise a generation of patriots!
