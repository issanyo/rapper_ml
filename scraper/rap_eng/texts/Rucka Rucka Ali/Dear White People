Smoking a blunt in my new Aston
Borrowed it from a man who wants it back
Said I just gotta take it to get some crack
In my new car
As I'm driving the cops say hey
Did we beat a black guy today?
Police pull me over and I told them
No please, I'm Kobe
My head hit the curb that they threw me on
They said you should've fuckin said that you're Lebron
They took my Aston Martin and they all went bowling, bowling
Why, am I treated this way because of my color
I thought shit would be different after Obama
But it's only racister now, it true tho
Oh yeah
Trump
Did you get elected here through your man
What is your connection to the Ku Klux Klan
DId you ever molest that lil nigga Trudeau
Dear White People
I got some questions you could answer me, bro
Why is you oppressing all of my people
Why you all pretendin like you're not evil
Dear White People
Sittin around in a fuckin gazebo
Sippin on a bottle of Pellegrino
Strokin on a cute-ass little fucking beagle
Why do you attack us everywhere that we go?
Tellin us to park your Porsche
Guess how it affects our ego
Lemme get yo phone thing code
Why you always braggin that you have one black amigo
Let me guess if does he know
That you say words like negro
You hire fucking Pablo
To cut your fucking shrub bro
But I can't get a job tho
If I'm not fucking rob lowe
Every time you do a crime the charges always got dropped
But I'm always gettin' thrown in prison
Yeah I got got
When you're out in the street up in the mornin' runnin
And you see us and you always think we
Gonna mug you
I just wanna see if u had any extra money
Why I gotta chase you when you take off runnin
Police on the streets all fuck with my peoples
Took my desert eagles and all of my Pringles
Why you always think that
Every brotha sells crack
I'm just selling Wii Box 2s and a Dell Mac
I sleep on the streets bro
Outside of Home Depot
Shoes are made of bondo
House is made at Kinkos
Chillin at the Redbox
Smokin on some red rocks
Used to be a shortstop playin with the Red Sox
Dear white people
Why you always tellin me what shit is legal
Why you take my opportunities from me bro
Why my new car now gettin repo'd
Dear White people
Sittin round listening to Flock of Seagulls
Listening to Iron Maiden and Meat Loaf
Buying fucking new shirts at Uniqlo
How the hell we ever gonna get outta poverty yo
All we got is EBT clothes
Some of us still wearin JNCOs
Got gold where our teeth go
Where the fuck did all them good times and the peace go
Black on black crime cuts deep yo
Hurtin ourselves like emos
We're black people
Individuality traded for hammer n sickle
Ghost of Booker T. lays comatose and feeble
History repeats itself like a ripple
Mohito burrito
Salad and dorito
5 dorra wonton
Comes with young chinko
You can get shwarma
Blow up all the gringos
Let's have some pizza
Don't think for yourself no
Find out where you came from
Dress up like a retard
Base your life on choices of dead old people
They musta known somethin' that we don't
Dear white people
