I don't like the Jews
I'm guessing that they
Don't like me too
And you can tell me if I crossed the line
Or if I'm racist
I'll try to keep an open mind
I put them all into a camp
But its my concentration
That wasn't really there all along

I know I could treat Jews better
And I can probably have been a better
Better friend
Tell me is it too late to try
I know I made Jews cry
And a few million Jews are dead
But I know I could treat Jews better
If I get a second chance

I'll stop fighting Jews
And I hope that they'll be nice to me too
I was so focused on promoting
My own Aryan nation
I forgot about my friendship with Jews
I haven't met too many blacks
But if I had to guess
I must have made some of them
Feel left out too

I know I could treat Jews better
And I can probably have been a better
Better friend
Tell me is it too late to try
I know I made Jews cry
And a few million Jews are dead
But I know I could treat Jews better
If I get a second chance

Hi, it's me. I hope you are surviving okay and everything I don't really know how to say this but

If you give me some time
I could change
I could try
I made you to soap
I must wash my hands
Just know that I always
Loved Jews
In my heart
Promise I won't do this again
I just want to speak together
Maybe I can
We just come meet for dinner
At Benningan's
I never meant to make you cry
Is it too late to try
Don't you remember what we said
As long as we stick together
Well make it to the end

And I can probably have been a better
Better friend
I just want to start again
Could we go back to when
We used to listen to Radiohead
But I know I could treat
Jews better
If I get a second chance
