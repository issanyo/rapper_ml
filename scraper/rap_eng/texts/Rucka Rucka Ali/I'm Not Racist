First off girls are bitch*s
I´m starting this song with
Burning some bridges
I don´t give a shit
If I never get rich
Couse gays that rape kids
Run shop business
Catholics batshit crazy old fascists
I see them guard more pedophiles
Than hassidim in Reseda
And PETAs are cracked out asshole eaters
Protecting animals
With their pen*s
Believe this
Each dude in congress
Sleeps with each bitch
Laughin at people that eat shit
And the president won´t let us
In the level of his bedroom
He sits and takes
Orders from the Devil
I´m not racist
I hate everyone
We´re all the same thing
Everyone´s a monkey yo
I´m not racist
I love everyone
We´re all amazing
One love!
Mexicans
Can´t help but to
Get a bit upset w/ them
Send them back
They just come
Jump the fuckin´ fence again
Let us in
We´ll cut your grass
Half price
We pick lettuce
Real nice
Like Asians
With the rice
Look at the whites
Afraid of their own shadow
Cause it´s black
White trash smoking meth
Instead of crack
When did blacks
Get whack?
It started with Simmons
In the yoga pants
Now rappers dress
Like women
The food at Ayreb restaurants
Is great, but your money gets sent
To some towel head of state
But the food is
Too good to pass up
It´s true the worse of culture treats women
The better the food

For today all
