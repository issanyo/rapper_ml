[Intro]
Jihad

I'm in a big truck drivin on people
& i'm screaming Aluwakbar (ay ay)
All the other walkin past on their way
But didn't get to walk far
Smoking on a blunt with Fouseytube
And counting all the shot cars
All my homies be like bakalaka  jihad
Dirka shirpa dirka
In my whip i'm backing up on people
And i'm wearin my new burka
After this we blowin up some people
In the street of Acapulco
Lettin out my rage killin infidels
It's the word of Allah
When i'm up in paradise
I rape a couple virgin girls
With my cock

Goin 80 miles an hour drivin a pedo van
Rollin through a group of people
I'm just tryna fit in to a crowd of women
Now i'm firin a rocket from the bottem of my benz
All the riches i'll be gettin
When i go to Heaven
Cuz i drove on some men

Flyin a big plane into a building
& im screaming Aluackbar
I'm not good at landin fuckin planes
But i could hit a fuckin tower
Swervin thru the city
& i'm hittin random buttons sippin vodka
Flyin Virgin Airlines to a place
Where there are some virgins i can fuck


I'm up in the hills of Bakalakistan
Screaming Aluwakbar
Roll up on you on a camel with a 47
Chewing on a tide pod
Shoot you from the back
We are from Iraq
Came up from nothing like Oprah
They like Ahmed how you
Blow up 12 car jihads & you only got 6 cars
Strap up my young kid with a 6 pack of bombs
When they come down the street
I say go fast oh snap
Then my kid explodes
Like a Note Sette
Love me or hate me
I just told the cold facts
Screaming Aluwakbar
Killing all the white guys
Kneeling towards Mecca
Chilling with this guy Carl
Eating on a snackbaqr
Filling up my mom's car
Screaming Aluwakbar screaming Aluwakbar

I be dropping bombs on major cities
And i'm screaming Aluwakbar
Drop em on the suckas and i turn em
To spaghetti like it's pasta
Smoking on a blunt with Lil Boosie
While the city people got got
All my homies back in Egypt sellin pitas for a dollar 25

Ay bro you need TNT
Special half off special bro
Buy 8 get 911 free
We knock down 2 for the price of 1
