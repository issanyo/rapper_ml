[Verse: Rucka Rucka Ali]
If I could speak to everybody in the world, I wouldn't
Not a single fuckin' soul would deserve to have heard it
They couldn't even grasp what I'm handing them
It's like there's so many blank stares I could bare in one life
If I could feed all the people of the world in need
I wouldn't even stop eating for them to stop bleeding
I feel better every second I hurt you
In a world where suffering is seen as a virtue
I'm falling apart
Every day is the same
Everybody's a stranger
I'm basting in anger
It's the same shit
Each day is over before it started
Walking around every party, is everybody just fuckin' retarded?
Somewhere far off in a numenal world
Every girl I ever wanted takes the form that I thought of
When I saw her standing tall, lookin' gorgeous in the corner
Right before she would fuck it up, shattering my dreams
Cause the image that I saw is just what she could have been
Listen to me, why don't you want me? Huh?
You think I'm ugly? Do I bore you or something?
Cause I've come a pretty fuckin' long way to be here
And to make myself available, to hell with you
Wait, no, I'll tell you what you are
The reason I'm breathing
You're why I started singing
Burning every bridge beneath me
Do I make this shit look easy? (I'm pissed)
I'll build the tallest monument
To someone I could have loved
And tear the fuckin' sky apart
To show you that I'm good enough
You're the music I discovered as a kid
I was told not to listen to the music but I did
And I heard the sounds of Athens, calling through the centuries
A ripple from the past, things Aristotle said to me
In writings that were buried, leaving the world in darkness
Til his words surfaced, unearthed by Aquinas

[Reprise: Rucka Rucka Ali]
In writings that were buried, leaving the world in darkness
Til his words surfaced, unearthed by Aquinas

[Outro: Rucka Rucka Ali]
You know that song I wrote for you?
Bet you never knew it was for you
That song that lit up the planet in laughter
Not after it made me a fortune
I guess I thought then...
If I wrote the perfect song you might notice me
Might know you made the wrong choice
When you chose him over me
Guess that's what I get
Letting someone close to me
