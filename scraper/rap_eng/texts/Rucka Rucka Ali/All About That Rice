[Hook:]
Because you know I'm all about that rice
About that rice, no Eggroll
I'm all about that rice
About that rice, no Eggroll
I'm all about that rice
About that rice, oh, herro
I'm all about that rice
About that rice

[Verse 1:]
I ain't no Japanese, I don't know Kung Fu
But I could bake a bacon, it's what I chose to do
I got that Goo Goo Sauce, give you a taste
Of my soy sauce all over your face
Don't go to PF Chang, fuck all that IHOP
I give you Goo Goo Beef with side of soda pop
If you are really hungry, come eat it up
Chicken cum with fortune cookie
And a Wonton Lollipop
Now my grandma, she told me put curry on all the rice
Drop Drop, Egg Drop Drop
She says curry is better with Goo Goo mixed up inside
Curry Curry, C-C Curry Curry
You know I won't be no bitch nigga serving you free egg roll
Drop Drop, Egg Drop Drop
So, if that's what you're into, then go to next restaurant

[Hook:]
Because you know I'm all about that rice
About that rice, no Eggroll
I'm all about that rice
About that rice, not Eggroll
I'm all about that rice
About that rice, vote Pedro

About that rice

[Verse 2:]
I'm bringing curry back
Go ahead and tell them chinky ninjas that
No I just play I know, you think you're black
But I here to tell you
Every meal come with coupon for half off at dry cleaning store
Yeah my grandma, she told me put curry on all the dogs
Drop Drop, Egg Drop Drop
She says boys like a little more curry with shih tzu paws
Curry Curry, C-C-Curry Curry
You know I won't be no bitch nigga serving you free egg roll
Drop Drop, Egg Drop Drop
So if that's what you're into then go leave the restaurant

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
Welcome to America

Do you want the Goo Goo Chicken Special
No extra charge for goo

I feel cocky all day
We have fresh goo made daily
