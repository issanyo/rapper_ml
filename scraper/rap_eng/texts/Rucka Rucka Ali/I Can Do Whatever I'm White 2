[Hook]
Watch where you walkin', bitch
What did you-
Wait a minute, I'm white!(hahahaha)
(Aww shit, 's been 10 years already)
I can do whatever I'm white(Yeah)
Yeah, I can do whatever I'm white(Yeah)

[Verse 1]
When I'm in the tramcar, eatin' 10-gram trans-fat bar
I could spread my legs far open on the chair
I don't care, cause I'm a white male
And I always have to the cops when they pass by to go arrest a black guy

[Chorus]
Anywhere I want I could get wi-fi
On the beach with my wife
She could be a fuckin' guy
Wear my socks with sandals
I want kale yeah
Got a job with the 401k
I'm gay

[Bridge]
I love me some hockey
I need me some hockey
I beat Fortnite
Take my date to see Rocky
Buy me a retriever
And eat a baked pita
And I could be a guy named Chad
Yeah

[Verse 2]
When I'm in Detroit, I run red lights
The cops don't mind, it's aight
They say you could do whatever you white
Baby, I could do whatever I'm white
Yeah
