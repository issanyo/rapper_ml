[Hook]
I hate Nickelback
I hate Nickelback
Oh yeah
I hate Nickelback
I hate Nickelback

[Verse 1]
They showed up
Sometime around 9/11
I'm not sure
But I think Al-Qaeda sent 'em
They the worst thing
Ever happened in music
At least Kurt never had to listen to 'em
Look
They're Canadian
What else can you say to them?
They spread gay radiance
And gave us all AIDS again
Play the song backwards
And you hear the devil laugh
Even worse
Play it forward and you hear Nickelback
Why did we let them start singin'
Now they're not leavin'
Make it stop Jesus
Hitler likes Nickelback
They're his favourite band
Canada please will you take 'em bitches back?

[Bridge: Chad Kroeger]
I love Jesus Christ
And I love America
I love my redneck fans

[Hook]
I hate Nickelback
I hate Nickelback

[Bridge: Chad Kroeger]
I ride my eagle
Over to Bennigans
And hang out with my friends

[Chorus]
I hate Nickelback
I hate Nickelback
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Pussy music
How the fuck do you do it?
Cowboy boots and a butt cut
Lookin' stupid
They never made it as a band
Tryna write music
Now how the the hell d'we wind up with these douches?
They're real cool among tribal tattoo faggots
Mom listened to em'
Driving you to soccer practice
Mom rock
Cool moms love a good rock band
Like this soft, shitty version of Pearl Jam
Why is Nickelback even in the rock section?
Can we get these retards a guitar lesson? (c'mon!)
Osama loves Nickelback
Canada, fuck you
Sending us fags

[Bridge: Chad Kroeger]
I blowed some guys
To get a record deal
For me and my whole band

[Hook]
I hate Nickelback
I hate Nickelback

[Bridge : Chad Kroeger]
I blow more people
By nine or ten am
Then most guys do all day

[Hook]
I hate Nickelback
I hate Nickelback
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Guys named Chad are really really hot
I heard he married the queen of punk rock
Nuh uh
Yuh huh
Guys named Chad are really really hip
I bet his band gets a lot, a lot of chicks
Yuh huh
Nuh uh

[Bridge: Chad Kroeger]
And all your life, I will remember you
My one and only friend

[Hook]
I hate Nickelback
I hate Nickelback
Oh yeah

[Bridge: Chad Kroeger]
We'll ride this eagle
Down our old avenue
We'll make it to the end

[Hook]
I hate Nickelback
I hate Nickelback
Oh yeah

[Bridge: Chad Kroeger]
Let's go to the biker shop
I need a Harley
To ride around the block

[Hook]
Nickelback sucks
I hate Nickelback

[Bridge: Chad Kroeger]
Kroeger is where I buy my stuff
Hot dogs and some beer
We'll have a barbeque

[Hook]
Nickelback sucks
I hate Nickelback
Oh yeah
