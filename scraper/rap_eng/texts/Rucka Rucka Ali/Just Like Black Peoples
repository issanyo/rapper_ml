[Hook 1]

Baby I'm being a black tonight
Turning my hat off to the side
Just like black peoples, black peoples, like black peoples, yoo
Maybe I'll drink a little sprite
I can smell chicken for miles
Just like black peoples, black peoples, like black peoples, yoo


[Verse 1]

Baby I'm.. I'm gonna watch some BET
And walk with the limp like ET
And you'll be mad when I live behind you
And in the dark you won't see me
I'm invisible but you can see my teeth
I'm like a floating smile beside you
Sipping grape soda in some tree
Tryna give all white bitches the D
I can play tennis or hockey
I can't swim and jet-ski
You know the man be holding me down
Pulling me over becuz I'm brown
And cuz I'm selling meth and weed and coke
Ohhh


[Hook 2]

Baby I'm being a black tonight
I'm bringing a gun to a pillow fight
Just like black peoples, black peoples, like black peoples, yoo
I'll be a pimp ass stolen ride
A couple of tattoos of Jesus Christ
Just like black peoples, black peoples, like black peoples, yoo


[Verse 2]
Baby I... so if I try its not enough
Always get blamed for stealing stuff
How would you like if everyone judged you
Ehy, a watermelon, I'll eat it up
And a white man, I'll beat him up
Its not my fault I can never trust you
Yeh, I can start over, its too late for me
I'll be in jail till I'm 93
I can pretend that I am free
In a state penitentiary
I've been in this system since I was born
Nobody told me whats right and whats wrong
How you expecting me to fucking know, BRO


[Hook 3]

Baby I'm being a black tonight
I never have weed and I need a ride
Just like black peoples, black peoples, like black peoples, yoo
Baby I'll learn to read tonight
I've banged teacher and she's white
Just like black peoples, black peoples, like black peoples, yoo


[Verse 3]

Baby I, I'm popeyes, Ima black guy, I can't get a black eye
I stole a car, I mean its mine, don't tell my mom
Yeh yeh yeh
I'm black and I'm black and I'm black, so don't mess with me
Black as I'm black cuz I'm black that you arresting me
Why its gotta be like that, cuz I'm black?
Cuz I sell and smoke crack?
You don't wanna live next to me?
Don't bother me and I won't bother you
What, are you racist?
On what bases you call me lazy?
You see me on the corner, hustelling all day
Give me money, comon, I got bills to not pay
I got things I need, like new nikes
Give me money, comon, I got kids to not feed
I buy my weed on the first and fifteen
Arrest me, comon, I got rights for you to not read
Yeeeeeh booooooooooooooooooy


[Hook 4]

Baby I'm being a black tonight
Got some crack for me to light
Just like black peoples, black peoples, like black peoples, yoo
Baby I'll eat a chicken pie
Not gonna play xbox tonight
I play basketball, basketball, like black peoples, yoo


[Outro]

Baby I'm.. come get me high, I hit you back next time
And I need a ride
Yeh yeh yeh
I jump real high, my teeth are bright
I wake up at night
Uh oh, just kidding, I'm not racist, puh...
