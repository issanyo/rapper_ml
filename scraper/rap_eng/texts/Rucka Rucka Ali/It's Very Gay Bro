[ INTRO ]

Ayo Copper Cab

What the fuck do you want Rucka?

You hear that hot new Jake Paul jam?

Yeah I heard it
What about it?

I'll tell you what about it
It's uhh, how do I say this?

[ Chorus ]

It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro

[ VERSE 1 (Rucka) ]

Jakey lil' baby
Lemme take you out and bang you in the anus
Make you famous when I break your ass, kid

I bend you like a grid
And I put it in a vid
'cause I put it in your butt
Like Mickey prob'ly did

Ohio is a piece of shit
For white boys
That sit up at the waffle house
And wish it was Detroit

I'll break into your Lambo
Shit into your Royce
Call me daddy of ten;
I'm breaking all your toys

I'm boys with Copper Cab
Yeah, I'm a fag

I grab a ginger by the dick
'cause I'm quick
And I stick a stick into the hick's dick, it's a trick
Like Mema put a fist in his ass when he's sick

I pick up my 6 millimeter eggroll
And mow down bitches on my lawn like a spick
And if my dicks still stiff
It's 'cause ya' know
It's very gay
It's very gay
It's very gay, bro

[ Chorus ]

It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro

[ VERSE 2 (CopperCab) ]

Well
I don't know why you have to say it's very gay, bro
That sounds homophobic but hey whatever you say, bro

Anyway, yeah this song is overrated
But that don't make what your doin' any less appropriatin'

'Cause your both straight white males
And its so infuriatin'
How you invade the rap game and yet you think you're so creative

And when you beef it makes me cringe because you're both related;
It's all formulaic
I guess what all I'm sayin's that

Yeah
I know this record is wack
It's like I'm having flashbacks of a Rebecca Black

A person popular or not will come to Youtube, make a track
Then get attacked
Then go home with a million dollars and a plaque
It's like

Every other YEAR this happens
Maybe they'll finally quit when they HEAR his rappin'

Because the only solution to quit all of the pollution
Is to quit clickin' their buttons and give 'em nothin'

[ Chorus ]

It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
It's very gay, bro
