[Intro: Rucka as Ben Carson]
And so I ask you American people
To vote my ass president
Please

[Rucka as Interviewer]
Thank you Dr. Carson
Mr. Trump, your turn to make a final statement
(heh heh heh)

[Verse 1: Rucka as Trump]
I was born in my own hospital
(a great hospital, the best you could imagine)
Delivered by the doctor that I bought
(and he thanked me
He said, "Donald thank you, this is terrific")
I bought at least a couple wifes
(3 highest paid women in America)
But the 3rd one doesn't speak English just right
(and she's great, I see her on holidays, terrific)
Now this country needs a good strong leader
I'm real busy but I may just have the time
If I let you elect the Trumpster
You're welcome

[Hook]
I'm a great leader and I can't read
We're being rapen by the Chinese
I'll make these China dogs my bitches
I'm the filthy richest
We need a hero that'll come help
I'll sell America to myself
I'll build yous highways and some bridges
I'm the filthy richest

[Verse 2]
I want to make this country great
(right now we're NOT great)
But the Mexicans keep coming here to rape
(and by the way, at least rape in English)
I'll build a wall no one could climb
(no one will climb this wall)
And the spics could rape on their own fucking side
(Mexico is the new China)
Now I'm seeing people talk about Trumpster
Saying things that quite frankly aren't nice
When I'm in charge of our nuclear program
You're all bombed (and fired)

[Hook]
I'm a great leader and I can't read
We're being rapen by the Chinese
I'll make these China dogs my bitches
I'm the filthy richest
We need a hero that'll come help
I'll sell America to myself
I'll build yous highways and some bridges
I'm the filthy richest

[Bridge]
We're losing, it's a catastrophe
I'll negotiate a better deal
I'll do a good job
We need a leader prez that'll get us out of our debt
Help the people get
Lower wig prices
We need a leader prez that'll get us rid of ISIS
Rip 'em all to shreds
Fucking towel heads
We need a leader prez that'll get us driving hybrids
Give us all some bread
With a side of Pez
And tell the Mexicans, and all the illegal migrants
You gotta get a license

[Hook]
I'm a great leader and I can't read
We're being rapen by the Chinese
(rapen by the Chinese)
I'll make these China dogs my bitches
I'm the filthy richest
(I'm the filthy richest)
We need a hero that'll come help
I'll sell America to myself
(America to me)
I'll build yous highways and some bridges
I'm the filthy richest

[Outro]
And I just can't help all yous bitches
I'm the filthy richest
It's gonna be terrific
Cause I'm the filthy richest
