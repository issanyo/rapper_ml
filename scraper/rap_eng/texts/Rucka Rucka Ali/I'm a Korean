[Intro]
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone

[Verse 1]
Oh hello
My name is DJ Not Nice
You might remember me
From my last record
Ching Chang Chong
You made me very rich
Now I roll in American money

[Refrain]
I'm a Korean

[Verse 2]
And I'd like my Chinese food
Cooked right cause they're not
Giving me the good rice
And The Dyke giving me
Food looks like a lesbian

[Verse 3]
I don't like how my
Beef pork look like
And the last time
I eat your food
I got the
Rice chicken
Beef tofu
Now I poop
While I'm peeing

[Verse 4]
And you might not believe
I could fight
I'm a white belt
But I have 2 stripes
I don't like all you little
Blue eyed dumb white
Europeans

[Verse 5]
I would like to just drink
My bud light maybe bomb
A couple things in
Hawaii and blow up
The countries I don't like

[Chorus]
Cause I'm a Korean

[]
I'm not that nice
Uh uh
I build a bomb
Yeah
Then pick a country
You
And blow it up
I work for NASA
Cool
We look at stars
Wow
You know Apollo
That movie is
Good

[Verse 6]
I talk like Ching Chang Chong
Why do you drop on me so much
Napalm
I been trained to kill
With my Tai Kwon Do
And my whole continent
Is a dry cleaning store
Bonzai

[Verse 7]
I like to play magic cards
You heard of China
I was in charge
Of Chinatown
In Vietnam
I'm still around
You can come through
To play
When I play poker
I just throw
All my chips in
Hello
I'm yellow just like
Homer Simpson
I smoke Coke
It's fun
You think
I'm joking man
I made a lot
Of money from
Pokemon

[Chorus]
I'm a Korean

[Verse 8]
I think
Michael Jackson's
A good guy
I don't mind
If he sleeps
With young guys
Cause in my country
We can touch
Young guys
On their penis
And my wife
Is 13
And cooks my
Macaroni N' Cheese
So good I
Got her out
On the street
For a good
Good price
10 years ago

[Verse 9]
I'm not gonna lie
Uh uh
I like it rough
Uh uh
Hillary Clinton
Let's get it
On
Woo
I have a missile
Uh uh
It's very small
So small
It's in my pants
Hehe
I can't get it up
Aww
I bomb New York
Oops
Better luck
Next time
You heard of
London
Uh uh
Not anymore
Aww
I bomb Iran
Yeah
Oops that's Japan
Not again
I made a goof

[Verse 10]
Now I gotta
Start again
I roll the world
Up in a ball
Like Katamari
If I bomb
Your crib
Yep sorry
I'm a ninja warrior
I went to Harvard
I bomb
Pearl Harbor
I want the
Whole world
To know
That I'm
Powerful
"I am small penis"
Everyone
To the floor
We all gonna
Die die die die
Put your head
Between your legs
And say
Ko ni chi wa
Death to all
Fuck the World
Cause I like
2Pac
Now the world
Must
Stop
Cause of my
Small cock
One day
You'll say
Why is everyone dead
Why didn't we just
Do what Kim Jong Il said
Now we all
Are slaves
Monkeys run
This place
It's planet
Of the apes
Oh okay

[Chorus]
I'm a Korean

[Verse 11]
And I'm not
Gonna beef
With Suge Knight
Because I think
That if he
Heard my
My 2Pac Parody
He'd find me
And tell me
I'm stealing
Hurry up
Take a picture
Of me dangling
From the balcony
And I'd like
My Chinese food
Cooked right
I don't like
Japanese or
The Thai
I would like
To see the
Whole world die

[Chorus]
Cause I'm a Korean
