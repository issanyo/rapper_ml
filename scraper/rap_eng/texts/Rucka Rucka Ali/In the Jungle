While Jason Russell jacks off publicly, allegedly
We are all living in the jungle, Dying from the hunger
No one in the Congo has any clothes
I'm a spear chucking fighter, Cutting off vaginas
I can read or write but i can go
(Weird african language again.)
We are all living in the Jungle, Jungle
I live in Africa
We are all living in the Jungle, Jungle
Bleeding from our bungholes

I'm in the jungle raping with my uncle
Sleeping in the bunker in Cameroon
I am a spear chucking fighter working for AlQaeda
Go onto your flight with a bomb in my shoe
We are all living in the jungle, jungle
We all live in africa we are all living with no water

Would you like a potato?
Jungle, Dying from the hunger
