I'm afraid downtown
'cause some people there are brown
And they all have guns
They're like "Nigga, give me money!"
I'm white!

When the night comes
They come outside
You might hit one with our car
And yell
"Twenty points!"

They might rob your ass
They might pop your ass
It all depends on if
Your white or black

I'll be leaving a baseball game
Might stop at the ATM
Someone says, "Excuse me sir, but can a cracker spare some change?"
And I pretend that I don't hear him
He says, "Please don't walk away! I need cash to buy some books and pencils"
I don't give a FUCK!

I'm afraid downtown
'cause some people there are brown
And they all have guns
They're like, "Nigga, give me money!"
I'm white
(I stay at home)
With my wife
(And kid and dog)
And I might drive by the hood
And wave Hi to black people

I'm afraid to go
See a game of basketball
It's a real dark sport
And I don't mean on the court
I'm white
(I stay at home)
And I might
(watch basketball)
On my
(television)
But then my fuckin' dog would bark

And there was a time
I wasn't scared of them
Back then,I'd even
Watch the Cosby Show
But then in an episode
Theo stole his dad's car
I got scared and built a fence
Around my back yard

I'll be sipping some light beer
I'll catch an episode of Scrubs
Maybe speaking with my kids
Picking Jesus over drugs
And on the TV someone says
"Send us money, we have AIDS"
Well I have AIDS
And I don't give a
I don't give a
I don't give a FUCK!

I'm afraid downtown
'cause some people there are brown
And they all have guns
They're like "Nigga, give me money!"
I'm white!

Oh, no!
Someone stole
All our stuff
(It was prolly black people!)

Oh, no!
Detroit, lost!
All we have is basketball!

Right now?
I stay at home!
Tomorrow?
I stay at home!
All my life?
I stay at home
With my Bible!
Hanukkah?
I stay at home!
Ramadan?
I stay at home!
The white house,?
Can't go there

I'm afraid of black people!
