[Hook:]
All my friends are vegan faggots bro
Searching for another man to blow
They're all gay and they're into dudes
They don't want any meat in their food
All my friends are vegan faggots bro
Searching for another man to blow
They're all gay and they're into dudes
They don't want any meat in their food

[Verse 1:]
Welcome to the veggie grill, hi, my name is Dave
And I am gay, what would you like today?
Just because I'm vegan, doesn't mean
I don't swallow cocks night and day, cos I am gay
If you ever had a bunny rabbit sleep next to you
If you ever had a chicken hen make sex to you
Then you get why it's bad to eat em in your food
Animals are friends, we all are gay

[Verse 2:]
We feel that it's wrong to eat a little snail
We eat sweaty balls with a little kale
You should come to the vegan convention
You'll cum on several men's chins
If you're into having big cocks, swing next to you
If you ever had a pig stuck his penis into you
It brings meaning to the saying cockle doodle doo
After all, we're gay, nothing more to say

All my friends are vegan faggots bro
Searching for another man to blow
They're all gay and they're into dudes
They don't want any meat in their food
Animals should not be on our plate
But, animals, they might be good to date
I'm out here, banging some homeless mutt
Looking for a set of monkey nuts
