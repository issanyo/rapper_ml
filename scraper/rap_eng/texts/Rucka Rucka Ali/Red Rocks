(Verse 1)
I found my mom's cocaine, when I was eleven
Was too young to know, heroin is better
Now I cook up meth, everyday for breakfast
And I like it, I like it a lot

And my teeth are gone
And my dick won't cum
And I still can not
Get it uuuupppp

(Hook)
Cause when I, get high
I, mix baking soda with some coke
Then I, boil up some water
Then I add some ice, mix it all together
Then it's rocks, red rocks, red rocks

(Verse 2)
And now the blunt, is laced
Cocaine mixed with chronic
If you try to play, two hits for a dollar
I don't do, cocaine
I just like the way, that it smells
That it smells, that it smells

And my teeth are gone
And my dick is soft
And I still can not
Get it uuuuupppp

(Hook)
Cause when I, get high
I, mix baking soda with some coke
Then I, boil up some water
Then I add some ice, mix it all together
Then it's rocks, red rocks, red rocks

(Verse 3)
Yeah! Train well, plan it right
Hand jobs for crack rocks
That's the way I live my life
Posted outside on the block
(Rocks!) Red, white, and black
(Rocks!) For five a sack
(Rocks!) My life is wack
I call Jay Bock at five o' clock
He got the rocks tucked in his sock
He say's let's go for a walk
That's how I know this ain't a joke
Get my cash and make a swap
We got the park on lock
Chaldos walk up and they're like "bakalakalak!"

(Hook)
Because when I, get high
I mix baking soda with some coke
Then I, boil up some water
Then I add some ice, mix it all together
Then it's rocks, red rocks, red rocks
Red rocks, red rocks, red rocks
Red rocks, red rocks, red roooooocks

(Verse 4)
Back in Pontiac, I was crack-runnin
I got jacked and it, wasn't that funny
I got clapped and it, wasn't that fun
I got my Glock and shot right back at 'em
My aim ain't perfect, I missed 'em
And then bought my crack right back from 'em

I wish I could sleeeeep
Or eeeaaat soooome fooooood
And I wish I could taaake
A craaap ooorrr twwwoooo
But it's crack that gets me this hiiiigh
And thaaaat's juuuust fiiine
