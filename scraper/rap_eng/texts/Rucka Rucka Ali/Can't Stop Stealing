[Verse 1:]
I'm always stealing, it's not my fault
I steal electric shit like brand new stereos
I was in prison when I was born
I'll die in jail for being black cos that's my home
I got your cell phone in my pocket
I got your Jordans on my feet
Bust your door if you lock it, forgot to knock (oops)
I can't help it if I shoplift
Nothing's ever handed to me
Want some Sunny D and some chocolate and some socks
Stealing your bike, your bed and your clothes
Stealing your wi-fi password next door
Stealing movies that I download
I'm just a black kid, just a black kid, just a black kid

[Hook:]
Nothing I do's my fault because I'm black, black, black
And the things I do's determined in advance, vance, vance
Born in jail, I never had a chance, chance, chance
I'm a victim of some fucked up circumstances
I can't stop stealing, I just can't, can't, can't
I can't stop stealing, I just can't man

[Verse 2:]
I stole this badass car
It comes with leather seats and air conditioner
With power steering and cruise control
And flashing lights behind me everywhere I go
I jack your android from your pocket
And sell it back to you on the street
That's why they call it the black market
Get it? I got it! (oooh)
I steal your Envoy when you park it
And take your wife and kids to the beach
Should've locked it twice when you lock it
(Yo, cops)
Spend every night in jail all alone
I sell drugs since I was one years old
When I was two, I was shot in the shoulder
I'm just a black kid, just a black kid, just a black kid

[Hook:]
Nothing I do's my fault because I'm black, black, black
And the things I do's determined in advance, vance, vance
Born in jail, I never had a chance, chance, chance
I'm a victim of some fucked up circumstances
I can't stop stealing, I just can't, can't, can't
I can't stop stealing, I just can't, man
I can't stop stealing, I just can't, can't, can't
I can't stop stealing, I just can't, man
