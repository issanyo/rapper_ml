[Intro]
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

[Verse 1]
Ah, I tell you where it's from – Africa
That's from where Ebola comes – West Side
It hides in the suitcase
Two days later it lands in the USA
I get it from my girlfriend and give it to my dad
I catch it on the subway and leave it in the cab
I eat it at Subway, drink it at Starbucks
Ebola's everywhere and I give no fucks

[Pre-Chorus 1]
They scared – it's bad
Ebola's gonna kill us all dead
They mad – how'd this happen?
Gotta make sure that nobody else gets it
I'm sorry but I have it and you have it or you'll get it
So forget it, don't sweat it, just let it be
I'm telling you Ebola's not the Enemy, listen!

[Chorus 1]
I have Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
And you have Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
And we have Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
Everybody has Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
Selena has Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
Justin has Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
Taylor has Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
Jesus has Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
Ebola!

[Post-Chorus 1]
Every shitty little village in Africa has Ebola
Every city in America is getting it now, just go with it, bruh

[Verse 2]
Airports, check if he's black
He could have Ebola so send him back
In fact keep a eye on the Black Eyed Peas
Mostly "Black" and "Guy", don't worry about Peas
And the Cosbys could have Ebola, also Oprah
Let's just close up Detroit 'til this crisis is contained
Don't let the Obamas on the plane 'cause

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They black, they could have Ebola
Might as well also watch for Arabs
If they have a brown face
We'll keep 'em safe in Guantanamo Bay
I'm sorry, everybody, for the drama
But we're gonna get Ebola if we let black people in
Ebola's not a country in Africa
It's the whole continent

[Chorus 2]
I have Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
You have Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
Obama has Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
Kanye has Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
Will Smith has Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
2Pac has Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
Steve Harvey has Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
Magic Johnson has Ebo-la-la-la-la-la and AIDS

[Post-Chorus 2]
Diddy and Biggie and Jay-Z and Nas have Ebola
Stephanie DJ & Kimmy Gibbler have Ebola
Every shitty little village in Africa has Ebola
Every city in America is getting it now, just go with the flow

[Chorus 3]
You have Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
Your mom has Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
Your uncle Tom has Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
Ariana has Ebo-la-la-la-la-la
Ben Affleck has Ebo-la-la-la-la-la

He got it from Ben Affleck – La-la-la-la-la

[Outro]
I have some Ebola (La-la-la-la-la)
We all have Ebola (La-la-la-la-la)
We need some Ricola (La-la-la-la-la)
