[Chorus 1]
China na na na
I left my wok back in China na na na
I ask for new one now from Santa na na
Order a wok from shopping channel
So I could cook banana
China na na na

[Verse 1]
It came in the mail and's fuckin' ruined
How I can cook my food?
My Mandarin is really fluent
I call complain to you
Where is customer treatment?
This really isn't cool
I was busy dry cleaning
While my kid making Nike sho-oo-oo-oo-oes
Stitched out of poison venom
Can't remember if I fed him
Gimme some wonton so-oo-oo-oo-oup
Eating helps me remember
If I fed the boy (Nom nom nom nom nom nom)

[Chorus 2]
China na na na
I left my chopsticks in China na na na
Left them up a sideways vagina na na
My chopsticks belong to my grandma
Those sticks been through some trauma
Oh na na na

[Verse 2]
Jet Li just graduated
With a black belt
He from Indochina now Vietnam
He racist to China
But he from it himself
Now (now) pretends
Like he was always Viet Congressman
We don't know he Chinese
Because he so shiny
Like napalm dropped on he
Now he glowing
Wait where he going?
Pearl Harbor with Boeing
Deep down he still Chinese
He try to hide his anxiety
He could lie it fine by me
But now everyone know he from

[Chorus 3]
China na na na
I left my dog back in China na na na
Now what I sposed to eat for dinner na na
I wrote it in my daily planner
Get the dog from kennel
I'm mad now na na

[Verse 3]
I flew to Shanghai airport
I'm back (back back back)
I know judo
So be careful
Or get smacked (smacked smacked smacked)
Would you like sweet sour sample?
Good snack (snack snack snack)
My crew is from
Bangkok ghetto
We're black (black black)
Who-oo-oo-oo
Ate my last wonton egg roll?
I asked Trump but he said no
Now what am I to do-oo-oo-oo?
Someone walking round China
With my egg roll
China na na na na

[Chorus 4]
China na na na
I left my ramen in China na na na
Heard there's a famine in Uganda (na na)
You know that country has some drama
They drinking out of sauna
Why not send a dollar?

[Outro]
Please send $1 to egg roll foundation in China (China)
I from China
I am ninja (Ninja) (I am a ninja)
Welcome to America (Welcome to America)
