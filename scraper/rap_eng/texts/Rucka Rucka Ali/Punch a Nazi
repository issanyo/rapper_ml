[Verse 1: Chris Ray Gun]
I'm on the streets
I'm so smart can't you see
My philosophy is:
"If you don't constantly bitch
About the president
You're a white supremacist"

Memeing a frog
Well, off to the gulag
Listen to Shadilay
My, what will the judge say?
Our dynasty
Can't understand irony

[Hook: Chris Ray Gun & Bionic Pig]
I'll defy the Klan
And all who call me dumb are nazi's
All by, all by proxy
So what if I become
All the things I claim to not be
Punch a, punch a nazi
#LoveTrumpsHate, you guys
So let's go pepper spray some woman's eyes
I'm so freaking shameless
Nameless in the crowd, where I'll be
Punching, punching nazis

[Verse 2: Chris Ray Gun]
Protesting gays
In a violent way
Calling fascism bad
While we're swingin' our bats
At the heads of those
Whose opinions we oppose (fascist)

Nazi's a word
And it's meaning is blurred
With it's use justified
Where it does not apply
But that's fine with me
I'm liberal apparently

[Hook: Chris Ray Gun & Bionic Pig]
I'll be demonizing
Everyone who's white and I'll be
Calling, you all nazis
So what if I become
All the things I claim to not be
Punch a, punch a nazi
#LoveTrumpsHate, you guys
So let's go commit several violent crimes
I'm so freaking shameless
Nameless in the crowd, where I'll be
Punching, punching nazis

[Bridge: Rucka Rucka Ali]
Swingin' fists and clubs
Knock 'em to the floor
Bring it like Brownshirts
1934
Curb Stomp! Pull out a gun
I may be Hitler, but I'm still not Trump

[Hook: Chris Ray Gun & Bionic Pig]
Everyone who doesn't
Think the way I do is obvi-ously, just a nazi
We'll be screeching loudly
Preaching understanding, while we
Punch some, punch some nazis
We'll never admit
That we're a just a bunch of hypocrites
I'm so freaking shameless
Nameless in the crowd, where I'll be
Acting, like a nazi
