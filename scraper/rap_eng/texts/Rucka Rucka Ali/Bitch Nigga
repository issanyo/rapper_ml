I'm a unit
That means I got no dick
They cut if off
When I was young
'cause I was very sick
They're very mental
Thanks for fuckin' chess
Poppin' cherries in the schoolyard
For the ultra sex

That shit was pretty sick
But it's all worth it in the end
To see you shit out brick

So fuckin' say something'
Go ahead and let me have it
By the end of the day
Your still a bastard faggot!

Fuckin' hit it!
You call the rest of your clips
Rollin faster than night
Still stuck in that Joe shit!

You fuckin' faggots!
You better sweat out piss
You fuck wit me
Turn your light into a river of shit!

Rucka Rucka, to your motha, fucka!
Suck your momma's titties round, sucka!!
The only bitch nigga that I seen in the room
Is fuckin' you nigga
Is fuckin' you nigga

I capped your granny
And ran her
'cause I couldn't stand her
I'm a bad man
People ought' call me a bad name!

You ain't understand
Why I cocked Michael Magnam
But I feel your kicks
And your bitch
So bitch, hand 'em!

You call the rest of your clips
Rollin faster than night
Still stuck in that Joe shit!

You fuckin' faggots!
You better sweat out piss
You fuck wit me
Turn your light into a river of shit!

Rucka Rucka, to your motha, fucka!
Suck your momma's titties round, sucka!!
The only bitch nigga that I seen in the room
Is fuckin' you nigga
Is fuckin' you nigga
