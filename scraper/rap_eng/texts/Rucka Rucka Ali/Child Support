[Chorus]
Child support for my kiddies
(got support for my kiddies)
Child support for my kiddies
(got about three-fiddy)
Child support for my kiddies
(I got support for my kiddies)
Child support for my kiddies
(I got about three-fiddy)
[end Chorus]

When you see me up in Chuck E. Cheese's feeding my kids
And I be buying 'em some fries and a couple of ribs
But my baby momma tellin me that she want more
(I need that [?] and a motherfuckin' child support)
She want my money all day
(and she gets her hair did)
She wants my chrome piece chain
(and she gets her nails did)
Cause when Moeisha and Tanisha need braces on they teeth
Then I can't buy an Xbox for Tito and Tanisha

Oh no
I let my Nikes go
Oh no
I let my Nikes go
All my baby mommas frontin cause she know that I'm broke
She say damn Rucka sucka Imma take you to court
Got these kids waitin on me
Ain't got no money
And these kids ain't mine
We could take it to Maury's
(aaaahaaahyaaa)
These twenty kids ain't mine

I ain't no damn cash tonight
(cash tonight)
Why you givin' me crap tonight?
(crap tonight)
Could we eat something fresh tonight?
You cook the same trash every night
(I come home and dinner is pizza?!?!?)

[Chorus]

Ieisha
Daquanisha
Moeisha
Malaria
Booquisha
Matisha

[outro]
You know who this
It be yo baby mamma
I need that [?] and a motherfuckin' child support
Don't you even tell me you be messin' around with those trick ass hoes
You know who this is, ok?
Recogn-know this
