I'm from America cuz it's number one
I could take a fuckin' dump and it would look like where you're from
Bad men flew a jet into 9/11
In the greatest fuckin' country...
This ain't your country!
So many people ask "Why did you take Iraq?"
I'll tell you why right fuckin' now...
(I'll tell you right now)
So that every time you fuck with us
We'll take some 'yer fuckin' stuff
So tell your homies I said
That all your countries have AIDS
Fuck you (Yea yea yea)
You got your AIDS from a gay donkey (Yea yea yea)
We'll fuck your mother for days, honky (Yea yea yea)
All you Al-Chidas will pay for this (gay shit)
Suck my balls
When freedom calls, it's calling collect
And I'll tell the operator "Yes, I accept"
Cuz these colors match the fuckin' carpet and drapes
Let's play some fuckin' games!

"At 9:11 this morning, we were given a message
And that message is that them folks in Iraq must not want their country very much"
--
Yeeehaw!
Blacks, Whites, Arabs, Jews
Living side by side
In this country, if you know another like it, you're a fag
Arabs mad 'cause imaginary man up in the sky told you to
Strap a bomb and blow yourself to shit
We'll take your fuckin' oil and make you suck our balls
And we'll rape your seven wives in the tits
(BITCH YOUR PUSSY SMELLS LIKE HUMMUS!)
Cuz baby, certain Muslims hate the things we love
Like bacon covered chicken fried steak
And all them suckers have AIDS
Fuck 'em (Yea yea yea)
You got your AIDS from a gay donkey (Yea yea yea)
We'll fuck your mother for days, honky (Yea yea yea)
All you Al-Chidas will pay for this (gay shit)
Suck my balls
In this game we're playing for keeps
So all you faggots better keep your receipts
Cuz it'll be a cold day in Pakistan if you think
You'll fuck with Toby Queef!

Remember when they hit them towers?
Man, that shit pissed me off for hours
So if them punks want fuckin' trouble
Better tell 'em they better go fuck with Mexico instead!

"We will catch the folks who did this, sodomize them and get 'em in Guantanamo, and make 'em watch episodes of Glee."

You faggot motherfuckers have AIDS
Fuck you (Yea yea yea)
You got your AIDS from a gay donkey (Yea yea yea)
We'll fuck your mother for days, honky (Yea yea yea)
All you Al-Chidas will pay for this (gay shit)
Suck my balls
When freedom calls, it's calling collect
And I'll tell the operator "Yes, I accept"
Cuz these colors match the fuckin' carpet and drapes
Let's play some fuckin' games!

"Now, I'm not sayin' everyone on the plane WAS a terrorist...but...
Statistics show
Hell, most of the people on that plane probably had somewhere else to go
But we ain't never gonna know now, will we?
Now, I'm-a tell you plain simple, you knock down our buildings, we'll take a couple yer countries
You can tell Mr. Bin Laden and his army of 70 virgins we can play games, God dammit!"
