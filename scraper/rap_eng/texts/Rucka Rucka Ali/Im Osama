[Chorus]

I'm gonna fly some planes
Into a couple buildings in Manhattan
I'm I'm Osama
Run tell Obama
I'm your fucking uncle

[Verse 1]

I walk into a airplane like
Bro man salam
This will be bumpy ride
Put your seat belt on
I got C4 bomb tucked into my undies
The pilot says "DAMN SHOULD'VE RODE MY DONKEY"
It's about to get crazy
When it's time to pray
I strap grenade to a baby
"Allah save me"
Happy Ramadamadamadingdong everyone
Let me show you what plane flying lessons gave me

Okay now turn left
I SAID TURN LEFT
"For everything else... there's Mastercard"

[Verse 1]
Maybe we just got off on the wrong foot
Let's start over
Hi we're gonna die
Here's a plastic bag for cover bro
Hope you're in the mood for 72 virgins
And I don't mean dudes that get your computer working
I'll explain it in a way that you can understand
P;uitgf)(*&^vxzn/zjki;&%agfsbcsz dirkistan
Hope you're planning on hearing 'bout great insurance offers
Cause this plane's 'bout to crash into some health insurance office
You heard of One Direction?
I'm in Al Qaedirection
My name is Zayn Hussein
I flew a plane on 9/11
Yes I may have let 'em planes go too far
I meant to get 'em back to Yemen for a new car
I'm the coolest guy every year at TerrorCon
All the terrorists are like "oh he got a telephone"

[Chorus]
I'm gonna drive a cab
Only got 20 bombs in my pocket
I'm I'm Osama
Sorry for the drama
Where should I drop you off at (Thank you)

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna drop some bags
At the marathon up in Boston
"TOO SOON"
Shit I blew my balls off
Whatchu know about explosive turbin on your noggin
Who you know been getting more hate than Bin Laden
This nigga, will fuck your kid and kidnap your parents
One man's terrorist's another man's arab
I'm a bad man bitches
I'm from Palistan which is in Afghanistan
I blew up Pakistan with a gas can
Come and find me everybody I'm right here
Hide and go seek champion 12 years
I'm selling you slurpees at 7/11
Up in Dearborn chilling with Saddam and his mothafuckers
I lead a Syrian rebellion mothafucker
I'm in New York on welfare mothafucker
They be like "you must pay for 9/11"
I'm like "Bro, can I pay you in Trident Layers?"
I give you free Chili gift card and a bootleg Iron Man 3 and a Angry Birds t-shirt
I call that a gift from me to your nation
I call that a full 9/11 compensation
Now we're squared up
And the Kardashians have always worked for me
I just wanna get that cleared up
Anyone you see with a turbin is workin' for me
Will we ever see middle east peace?
Nigga please
They'll always be 1 or 2 jihads at least
Watch me spit a flow bro (Here we go)
I got back hand like Macklemore (What)
A bitch walk up and I smack a whore

[Chorus]
I'm gonna pop some caps
Homie got dynamite in my jacket
I'm I'm Osama
Get ready for the summer
Shit's about to blow up

[Bridge]
I wear the baddest robes
I chill with bad ass bros
Like David Allan Coe, Al Assad, and Camel Joe
I wear the baddest bombs
I kill americans
I win the marathons
Taylor Swift has camel toe

[Chorus]
I'm gonna fly some planes
Into a couple buildings in Manhattan
I'm I'm Osama
Run tell Obama
Let me fly Air Force One
(Oops)

[Outro]
Thank you
First I need to thank, Jesus
Without him there could be no 9/11
I'd like to thank my flying instructor, Barack Osama *clears throat?*
Obama, sorry hummus in my throat
Jihad Xpress for the last minute job
The Saudi family, Paula Abdul, Selena Gomez, and the rest of Hamas
Thank you to my wife, there's too many of them to name
And thank you R. Kelly who made me believe I could fly
Thank you
Oh and the fans, thank you to the fans
