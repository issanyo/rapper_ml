Im just a dumb, redhead ginger!
You better run! i want your soul!
Im just a pale, freckled ginger!
I came from hell, my blood is cold
I have no soul
I have no soul
I want your soul
I want your soul

Gingers! Have no friends
And no one will have sex with them!
They come out at night, they creep and crawl
Who does God hate most of all?
Gingers!
Who should have never been born?
Gingers!
Who's adopted?
Gingers!
Who belongs with floating turds in the fucking toilet bowl? Gingers!

Gingers are leprechauns
Evil Irish little drunks
They should all be killed at once!
Kill em' and collect insurance!
But they're already fucking dead
Skin is white, hair is red
They like giving head to men in bed
It's gay

I'm just a drunk
With a temper
Has anyone seen me lucky charms?
I'm just some scum
From the shitter
My hair is red
Its fucking wrong

I'm just a dumb (I'm just a dumb)
Redhead ginger (ginger)
You better run (you better run fast)
I want your soul (I want your soul)
I'm just a pale
Freckled ginger
I came from hell (I came from hell)
My blood is cold (my blood is cold)

I have no soul
(ginger)
I have no soul
(ginger)
I want your soul
(ginger)
I want your soul
(ginger)

Prince Harry
Lookin' scary
Virgin ginger german fairy
From the royal ginger cunts
Who the fuck is Kirsten Dunst?
Ginger!
What's Conen O'brien?
Ginger!
Kanye?
Nig, uh Ginger!
Ed Sheran, Lindsay Lohan, Jesus fucking Christ?
Ginger!

Ginger grows
In the ground
Looking gross
Tasting sour
Creeping close
Without a sound
Steal your soul
Never found
Gingers!
Eww!
Orange colored pubes
And by the way
Don't get me started on the Jews
Wait what?

I just hate all
Stupid gingers
They all are bad
None of them are good
So suck my balls
Evil gingers
Like carrot top
I hate him the most

I'm just a dumb (I'm just a dumb)
Redhead ginger (ginger)
You better run (you better run)
I want your soul (I want your soul)
I'm just a pale (just a pale)
Freckled ginger
I came from hell
My blood is cold

I have no soul
(yeah)
I have no soul
(c'mon everybody)
I want your soul
(eeeeeeahhhhh)
I want your soul
(a,b,c,d)

And the lord said
Bewareth thy ginger
For he beith a nasty, daywalkin vampire
Who will stealith your soul
For don't you knoweth
A ginger gaineth a freckle for every soul he taketh
