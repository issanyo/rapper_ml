Ima dirty iraqi
Ay bro man habibi
Bro dude man
Bro man habibi
You can call me jihad joe
You need gasoline?
Bro, I have that good shit
Premium bp
For me it's free

Throwing bomb at everybody
Doing a jihad with my bros
Would not shower yesterday
If I knew you have cologne
Strap a bomb to every nut
And I'm itch them in the street
Every Body blows up and I say
Don't look at me

(Let's go)

People always say don't do jihad
Ima dirty iraqi
We be flying plane in to your town
Ima dirty iraqi
Niggas tell me not to blow myself up
Ima dirty iraqi
72 virgins isn't enought
Ima dirty iraqi

Bro man bro man bro
I work at party store
You buy grape soda
I send your cash to Al qaeda
They kill your mom and dad
This makes you very sad
So You buy wild turkey
I send cash to wild durkys
Uncle osama
Sent me new sweater vest
It come with automatic bomb strap to the chest
My name is mister dirka al assad jihad awaki

Ima dirty iraqi
If you blow up
And you don't give a fuck
This is what you say:
Ima dirty iraqi
And if your on the watch list in 40 countries
This is what you say:
Ima dirty iraqi
And if you own a summer home
In guantanamo
This is what you say:
Ima dirty iraqi
And if your put explosives on your own kid
This is what you say:
Ima dirty iraqi

Bro Bro Bro Bro Bro Bro Bro Bro

I Grew up in pakistan in Abadabadabadaba
Whatever we call it
Blew up falafel stand
And drive off bumping
Dj khaled
What is brown and hairy
And makes your plane ride scary?
I give you clue
Give up?
It blows up twice a week
In iraq
I'm like 2pac
I don't give a fuck
Wearing a birka and birkenstocks
Work at 7-11 part time
Do 9/11 When I have time
Yeah
And I always buy 1 way ticket
When I fly
Fly a plane into your bitch
If I have to tell her twice

Ima dirty iraqi
People always say don't do jihad
Ima dirty iraqi
Bringing the grenade to your night club
Ima dirty iraqi
Niggas tell me not to blow myself up
Ima dirty iraqi
72 virgins isn't enought
Ima dirty iraqi
