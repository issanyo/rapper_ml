[Verse 1]
Stone cold sober, 'bout to get knocked out (are you ready for me?)
Wanna party hard, wanna get real loud (tonight, I'm feelin' sexy)
A girl over there damn near passed out (I know you're watchin' baby)
And that's what happens when you're in the crowd

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't control what I feel
(Somethin' 'bout to make me get it up)
Somethin's got me ready
Somethin's 'bout to get me baby
(Don't have to tell me to get fired up)
If I don't move now, it might erupt
Get fired up
Fired up
Fired up
Fired up

[Chorus]
All the girls on the floor, better get fired up
(Get fired up, get fired up)
(If you're feeling sexy)
Boys on the wall, better get fired up
(You just can't get it for free)
(Get fired up, get fired up)
All my girls at the bar, better get fired up
(I know your body loves me)
(Get fired up, get fired up)
Stop gettin' with mine
Better get fired up

[Hook]
Get fired up crazy with me
Get fired up, fired up, fired up
Uh, uh, uh
Watch out, it's gonna blow
Uh, uh, uh
Watch out, it's gonna blow

[Verse 2]
Why you over there lookin' left out
(Do I intimidate you?)
Everybody over here getting real loud
(Come closer, can't hurt you)
Wore those jeans here to shake your ass
(Move it baby)
So shake that thing 'till you lose your chance

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't control what I feel
(Somethin' 'bout to make me get it up)
Somethin's got me ready
Somethin's 'bout to get me baby
(Don't have to tell me to get fired up)
If I don't move now, it might erupt
Get fired up
Fired up
Fired up
Fired up

[Chorus]
All the girls on the floor, Better get fired up
(Get fired up, get fired up)
(If you're feeling sexy)
Boys on the wall, Better get fired up
(You just can't get it for free)
(Get fired up, get fired up)
All my girls at the bar, Better get fired up
(I know you body loves me)
(Get fired up, get fired up)
Stop gettin' with mine
Better get fired up

[Hook]
Get fired up crazy with me
Get fired up, fired up, fired up
Uh, uh, uh
Watch out, it's gonna blow
Uh, uh, uh
Watch out, it's gonna blow

[Pre-Chorus]
Somethin's 'bout to make me get it up
Somethin's got me ready
Somethin's 'bout to get me baby
(Don't have to tell me to get fired up)
If I don't move now, it might erupt
Get fired up
Fired up
Fired up
Fired up
Bet you wanna get fired up
I bet you too scared to get fired up

[Outro]
Oh, get fired up
Uh oh (yeah)
Get fired up
(Get fired up, get fired up)
Uh oh (all my girls)
Get fired up
Uh oh, oh (c`mon!)
(Get fired up, fired up, fired up)
Uh, uh, uh
Watch out, it's gonna blow
