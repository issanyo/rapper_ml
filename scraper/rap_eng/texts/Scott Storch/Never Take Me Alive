[Jay-Z]
Ya know what we doin here
Young, H-O-V
From the number one, R-O-C
We got another one!

[Verse One: Neef Buck]
Yo, it's a big payback
Revenge at the tip of my lips
Grip on my fifth and brought my big K back
Y'all don't understand some of the pain I go through
Half of y'all can't even dig it
Y'all can't even picture
A motherfucker killing someone you close to
And they say it's over someone you close to
And they family approach you
And you dealing wit' his family emotions
And these motherfuckers say you ain't focused at the same time
But they wasn't on the same vibe
I remain calm
This aim mine when it's game time
Though you gone dog you spirit still wit' us
For the clueless we just clearin the picture
And we airing them niggas
Riding hard 'til we bury them wit'cha
Show you how much we care for you niggas
And I'm ready to pop
My crew too before they let me get popped
Rest in piece A-L, O-Reddy, and Hop
They'll never take me alive!

[Hook: Neef Buck]

[Verse Two: Jay-Z]
The Commission was our vision
We ain't it see it come to fruition
We ran outta time, damn
You think I'm just a fan? You out your mind
That was my motherfucking man and my partner in crime
Big you had the Mafia
Me, I got the Property
Got a lot of these fake families out here copying
But nigga trust I'mma flush all this bullshit
All this fake 2Pac and fake Suge shit
We ain't the first to make hood shit
We ain't invent the wheel
But we made the Goodrich tyre
And now we hood rich
And I rhyme like my Momma still in the hood, shit
But my Momma got V12 under the hood
She got C-L on back of the 6
Now my only job is to help little Chris
Get his Momma out this bitch
Avoid the drama out this bitch
They'll never take me alive!

[Verse Three: Young Chris]
Just lost another one
We'll always love you dog
Just like my Mother son
My second brother dog
They say we go to hell
When he die we ain't lose 'em
But Hov say 'Throw it up!' So we gotta keep it moving
So me I maintain
But it's stress on my brain
But your death ain't in vain
Lost my breath when it came and, uh
They say we 'joice in death but the pain
Best believe my first boy gon' be blessed wit' your name
All that's left is your face on the picture, on my dresser in the frame
And it just ain't the same I'm like
Damn man, how another homie missing
Not to mention Big Homie stressing
Where do I go for advice
Man it's shows every week, but its bodies every night
Men is cold on these streets and, uh
Niggas know the police
And the drama it's still there
And my momma she still there
They'll never take me alive!

[Verse Four: Jay-Z]
Now it's no turning back, it's like a gat
Once you pull it dog you never put it back 'til you clap
Tell the hood I'm back, this ain't rap
This is shit I'm just tellin you on a track, I relax
Niggas fell into the trap
You like a puppet wit' no strings
We hella good at that, in fact
Exactly where you at is where we wanted you for months
So we could come through wit' Mack and 'brrrraatt!'
This is war my niggas
Y'all niggas is drawn like cartoon figures, it's a fact
We pour out a little liquor cause we lost a couple niggas
But we bout to get y'all back, we sat
We plotted y'all demise
Got a box wit yo' size and your name attached
How you like that?
It's only right
B-I in L-A, God bless your life
They'll never take me alive!
