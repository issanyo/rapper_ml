[Intro]
[R. Kelly]
I hope y'all got y'all playa's cards
'Cause y'all ain't gettin' in unless you do

[The Game]
Bounce, it's the new 12-play
Bounce, throw the pussy like Elway
Bounce, I wanna see your tail shake
Bounce, when you hear R. Kellz say

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
(She on the floor) Surrounded by them playas and thugs
(She on the floor) The girls goin' wild in the club
(In V.I.P.) Got 'dro with a bottle of bub
(She don't care) Shakin' ass, just throwin' 'em up
I'd really like to know her
The way she runs her
Body up and down, she got me heated up
I can't front, I really wanna beat it up
Show her how I hit the bar and spend it up
You ain't gotta be worried 'bout being alone
'Cause tonight we'll be together in my home
Exit out the club, bouncin' our domes
Got that red coupe matchin' the chrome
Put that body in motion, motion
And watch it wave like a ocean, ocean
Now break it down and worm it, worm it
Now bring it up, now shake it, shake it

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm still fresh like, uhh, Impala, uhh
Dre's young gun still ridin' the bass drum
Four times platinum, Hate It Or Love It, I'm still number one
Still in the hood, one hand on my gun
And my trigger finger still make bitches come
I mean the one with the ring in the tongue
Compton, R. Kelly found her in the slumps
Shaking that rump, both hands on the pumps
Send her home with me, I have your girl yellin', uhh
Kellz, my bitch drunk
But her two girlfriends still wanna have fun
Pass the blunt, let her drink red rum
Bet she ain't never seen a penthouse at the Trump
Me and R. been around the world
And we'll give it to you just how you like it, girl

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Girl, you're on a mission
Step into the club, shuttin' down competition
The way you walk it, talk it, switch it
And when the doors close, handle your business
Now make your booty go (Boom boom boom boom)
Break it down now (Boom boom boom boom boom)
Bring it up now (Boom boom boom boom)
Push it back, girl
(Kellz, you crazy for this one)
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Out the club, in the coupe to the mansion
We gon' get bent up 'til the morning
Laying back in the chair while you wind it
Lap dance on me girl, bump and grind it
We gon' do it 'til we drop, until the party stop
We gon' keep it hot, oh

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
I like it when you flip that, bump that, roll that
Shake that, drop that, grope that
Make it go clap-clap
Flip that, bump that, roll that, shake that
Drop that, grope that
Make it go clap-clap

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

[Outro: R. Kelly]
