Song:   Caught Without An Umbrella


Memories come down and me once again
Caught without an umbrella
Memories come down and me once again
Caught without an umbrella

Well it was not -that he was particularly
Suicidal he just didn't care wether he lived or died though
It was just a matter of time
You got yours and I got mine
When he turned sixteen
They said he could drive
When he turned eighteen they said he could die
When he turned twenty one he could buy rum
But no one ever taught him
How things were done
Then an angel appeared inside his head
She said boy do you think
You're realty better off dead
He don't know he just shook his heed

(chorus)
Cause he thought the day that he died
Would be a normal day for the people on the other side
He thought that the day that he died
Would be a normal day for the people on the other side
But memories come down and me once again
Caught without an umbrella

But time was a matter of velocity
In this age of information and technology
He would cry in the shower
Put his face in a towel hot from the dryer
Then he sat down and wrote a note to his mom
When all is said and done
Can I still be your son
Because manhood is so elusive
And respect is so exclusive
And I got a daddy to prove it
I think I'll never get to shake it and move
Then he tied a rope around his neck
Looked in the mirror and said what the heck
I'm gonna bring the whole roof down with me
And then he jumped

(chorus)

"Come in Vernon'

But halt way down
He heard what the angel said
And he realized -he really didn't want to be dead
He landed with a thump- his head was reeling
Layin in a lump- looked up at the ceiling
And saw that the rope... had broke
Well he failed at the only thing
That he thought he couldn't fail at
That was takin' his own life
And he said" I kinda like livin'
He could feel his heart makin a boom
Sounded like music in the next room
Music in the next room
He said "it's time for a celebration"
Felt his hands looked at his face
Lifted the rope off his throat, "I ain't such a disgrace."
He said manhood is so elusive and respect is so exclusive
And I gotta daddy to prove, that some people never get to
Shake it and move

(chorus)

And He knew that the day that he tried
Was not a normal day for the people

And memories come down and me once again
Am caught without an umbrella
