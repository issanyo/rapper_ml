[Verse 1: Berner]
We bulletproof and limo tint every car
I’m in the club breakin’ down exotic weed on the bar (Okay)
All these little pretty model bitches love how we are
She said she want to rock with me, told her “Baby, I charge”
I’m form the city where we gitty yeah we cam up from none
Yeah its an old school, a classic got a stash and my gun
Yeah, my crib got a couple grow rooms for my tree
That’s a homie but he ducked me when he owe me for weed
They got me stressed out, take a hand full out the P
Smokin’ Scotty, if you got it, then it's probably from me
In a half-a-million dollar car, runnin’ on E
We really got it if you need it, grab a couple for cheap
Play your roll

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Play your roll (aye), play your roll (aye)
Play your roll (yeah, yeah), play your roll
Play your roll (yeah), mind your own (yeah)
Stay in your lane (yeah), fuck with this gang (yeah)
Play your roll, play your roll, play you roll (yeah, yeah)
Play your roll, play your roll, play you roll (yeah, yeah)
Play your roll (yeah), mind your own (yeah)
Stay in your lane (yeah, yeah), fuck with the gang (yeah)

[Verse 2: Berner]
I love to flex but I don't hop on no jets (hell naw)
150 for my carry-on and dogs make me sweat (sheesh)
I ridin’ dirt in my Cadillac, don’t fire up yet
When we get there we gonna celebrate and we don't drink Moet (no, no)
Yeah, it’s 2017 boy and Bern got the juice
I’m reppin’ Cali like Snoop and my weed taste like a fruit
I need that big body, I don’t fit in no coupe
I can get it out to London, I might ship you a few
We got the whole world trippin’ off the shit that we blow (that strong)
Fuckin’ cops pull me over, had me late to my show
Fuck a hater I got way too much paper to blow
We back to back in Europeans, that’s the way that we roll

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Play your roll (aye), play your roll (aye)
Play your roll (yeah, yeah), play your roll
Play your roll (yeah), mind your own (yeah)
Stay in your lane (yeah), fuck with this gang (yeah)
Play your roll, play your roll, play you roll (yeah, yeah)
Play your roll, play your roll, play you roll (yeah, yeah)
Play your roll (yeah), mind your own (yeah)
Stay in your lane (yeah, yeah), fuck with the gang (yeah)
