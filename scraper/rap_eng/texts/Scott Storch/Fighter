Blaine:
Huh, after all that you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you
But in the end, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger

Well, I thought I knew you
Thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up 'cause I've had enough

You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joyride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh uh, oh no, you're wrong

'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, yeah yeah yeah oh

Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I'd realize your game

I heard you're going 'round
Playing the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to haunt me
But that won't work anymore
No more, uh uh, it's over

'Cause if it wasn't for all of the torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now
And never back down
So I wanna say thank you

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust so cruel
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth

You tried to hide your lies
Disguise yourself through living in denial
But in the end you'll see
You won't stop me

I am a fighter and I (I am a fighter)
I ain't gonna stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough!

(Makes me that much stronger) Oh!
(Makes me work a little bit harder) Oh!
(It makes me that much wiser) Oh yeah, oh yeah
(So thanks for making me a fighter) Fighter
(Made me learn a little bit faster) Oh, whoa, oh
(Made my skin a little bit thicker) Hey, yeah
(Makes me that much smarter) Oh
(So thanks for making me a fighter) Fighter

You thought I would forget
But I (But I remember)
Whoa ('Cause I remember)
Whoa, oh (I remember)

You thought I would forget
Whoa whoa (I remember)
Oh, whoa ('Cause I remember)
Yeah, I remember

(Makes me that much stronger) Oh, oh, oh
(Makes me work a little bit harder) Hey, yeah
(It makes me that much) Wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
