Be easy hommie let's pop a bottle
This is for the fellas in the spot that wanna rock with me
Tonight I wanna find me a model
We all came here and do what we do

I know you ain't tryin to get caught up
You don't got a problem chillin in the spot with me
And we just wanna have a good time
VIP is about to get hotter

[Chorus x2]
Leave all them troubles hommie and lets pop the bottle
Come on now mommi we sippin Dom Perignon
Know that your feelin it when you jump up and holla
Shakin' it shakin' it take it high bring it low

If you wanna love somebody
You need to get up out your seat
If you wanna be ma shorty
Then come and give your love to me

If you wanna love somebody
You need to get up out your seat
If you wanna be ma shorty
Then you gotta come and give your love to me

Be easy hommie lets let the game roll
When it comes to singin' ain't nobody that can drop like me
The ladies wanna get with me coz they know
They ain't never seen a player how I move

And when they get with me they wanna stay close
Everything is payed for when you makin' dough like me
Now everybody throw ur hands out
Shorty be shakin' it like she got some for me

[Chorus x2]
Leave all them troubles hommie and lets pop the bottle
Come on now mommi we sippin Dom Perignon
Know that your feelin it when you jump up and holla
Shakin' it shakin' it take it high bring it low

If you wanna love somebody
You need to get up out your seat

If you wanna be ma shorty
Then come and give your love to me

If you wanna love somebody
You need to get up out your seat
If you wanna be ma shorty
Then you gotta come and give your love to me

[Rap x2]
Lets pop a bottle hommie
Lets just be easy
Leadies know we sippin' Dom Perignon
Know that you wanna a mommi
So lets just be easy
Shakin' in shakin' it take it high bring it low

(Baby I want you love)
If you wanna love somebody
(And I can't get enough)
You need to get up out your seat

If you wanna be my shorty
(Coz you don' wanna walk)
The come and give your love to me
(Common' common')

(But I want you love)

(And I can't get enough)
