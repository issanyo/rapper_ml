[Chorus 1]
I got that comeback
The Hubba bubba
I got the run back
Run back and tell you mother
I throw the rah-rah on them
Put it all the way down
I got a lifetime warranty
Guaranteed
You will never leave

[Verse 1]
Warning
Beware, handle with care
If you are lucky
There is a chance you will make it there
This is serious
Girls like me is so rare

[Chorus 2]
Once I put that on them
Put that on them
Put that, put that
Put that on them

[Verse 2]
Now I know what I am doing
Watch you going to do with this?
I will let you catch a feeling
With just a little bit
Do not want to rush into it
And catch a sugar fit

[Chorus 2]
Once I put that on them
Put that on them
Put that, put that
Put that on them

[Chorus 1]
I got that comeback
The Hubba bubba
I got the run back
Run back and tell you mother
I throw the rah-rah on them
Put it all the way down
I got a lifetime warranty
Guaranteed
You will never leave

[Verse 3]
Caution
Keep away from open flames
Because it is hot hot hot
Fire marshals cannot contain it
You need rehab
Cos this thing is so addictive
When you put that on her
Put that on her
Put that, put that, put that on her

[Verse 4]
(Hey!) Do not pass the lines of pleasure
Do not get too close behind
I would not give you directions
You better read the signs
I will reach my destination
You better fall in line

[Chorus 2]
Once I put that on them
Put that on them
Put that, put that
Put that on them

[Chorus 1]
I got that comeback
The Hubba bubba
I got the run back
Run back and tell you mother
I throw the rah-rah on them
Put it all the way down
I got a lifetime warranty
Guaranteed
You will never leave

[Bridge]
Do not ask me questions about
You thinking what I am about to do
Do not be all clingy on me
I am sure I will finish with you
I will leave you traces of me
But you better have a clue
Or I am not coming back to you

[Chorus 1]
I got that comeback
The Hubba bubba
I got the run back
Run back and tell you mother
I throw the rah-rah on them
Put it all the way down
I got a lifetime warranty
Guaranteed
You will never leave

[Interlude]
This ticket is a round trip
You can go away now, but you are going to return
This ticket is a round trip
You can go away now, but you are going to return
Return to me

[Chorus 2]
Once I put that on them
Put that on them
Put that, put that
Put that on them
Hey!
