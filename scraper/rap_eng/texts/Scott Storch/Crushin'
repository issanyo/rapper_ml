So whatchu want, shawty? (Your love)
So whatchu need, shawty? (Your touch)
So whatchu want, shawty? (Your love)
So whatchu need, shawty? (Your touch)
I can't wait no longer, I need you
Lately I've been crushin' over you

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Crush
But you know this
I'm tryin' to make her mom bring her in the open
I traveled the world, the combo's the dopest
Up in the late night, keep me all focused
And all the weekends, keep her body soakin'
She's a yellow bone mommy well spoken
And we be sippin' champagne and we smokin'
They said the energy's flowin, and potent
I'm livin' on the road, and she livin' on the plane
Next time I see you, see we gotta bring the ting
We gon' do what we come to do
Started from the livin' room, to the bedroom
Have you in my room(?)

Crush
Just bando(?)
When I see her sippin' moon, light the candles
Send a sex text "Baby girl, random"(?)
Really think she really got me by the hand
I'ma come over little bit of nothin' but some sandals
Leave early, panties on my mantle
Little nook, call me papi, get a stander(?)
Haul ass, no breaks, no scandals
Just slow(?)
Tell me whatchu need though
Next off day need 'bout three of those
We gon' do what we come to do
Started from the livin' room, to the bedroom
Have you in my room(?)
