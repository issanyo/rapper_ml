[Verse 1]
See I rap just like saran, I'm back to do the damn thing
Rap's changed, so I'ma practice till my ass can't
Do this no more, bitch I'm the coolest, of course
I gotta ruin this sport for you and give you a divorce
If you saying you married to the game and carrying caine
I wanna let you bitches know that I am very insane
And I will bury you lames, you think you scaring me, may-
Be you wanna just pick your shit up and prepare a new lane
And get out of this rap shit, find a new address
Before you get blasted when the ratchet go clack-click
But I ain't into that, I like to get bloody
Pull a knife out somebody's body, stick it right in your buddy
I don't care if you unaware that I'm a psychopath, like to bath
In somebody else's blood, call me selfish but I'm alright with that
'Cause I got a Michael mask and an O.J. glove
If you gon' play thug I'll make you dig your whole grave up

[Hook]
I don't know where to go to now
Seems like I been on this road a while
I just need someone to show me how
How to escape this place, I'm losing my mind
I don't know where to go to now
I guess I been on this road a while
So fuck you all, you can go to hell
I don't give a fuck, I'm nuts, I'm losing my mind

[Verse 2]
So if you're sick of what's on the radio, stick this shit in your stereo
Listen so you can hear me, I'm sicker than a venereal
Picture a bitch hysterically itching at her waist area
That's because of me, disgustingly busting these lyrics up
Now I'm not saying I'm some sort of disease, son
More like the reason all these MC's freezing at the knees and
Staring in toilets, so paranoid that they hear a noise and
Pick up the telephone and yell at homes, "Yo, where my boys at?"
Then you realize your phone has been disconnected
Then I gouge out your eyes, rip out your bones, you get your neck slit
Then I'll have breakfast with an anorexic, flexible, death chick
She never ate shit so I felt no less than disrespected
I panicked, losed my shit, grabbed her satanic crucifix
Had me on some Lex Luthor shit, hammered, I rammed it through her chest
The waitress walks up, hands us a stupid check
"Damn it, are you legit?", grabbed her head and I smack the roof with it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Am I the crazy one, just 'cause I wanna raise a gun
And blaze you son, for those wack and utterly lazy puns?
Well if so, fuck me, I'm really sorry, bruh
But I'ma still slaughter ya and make sure that the fear of God's in ya
God I feel like a Saudi Arabian with some rabies and
Maybe one day I'll be crazy enough that they wanna pay me and
Eighty-some-thousand people come see me play at a stadium
Raising a generation, disgracing the name's who faking 'cause
Shit's gotta change whether you like it or not
Which by the way, I'm doing even if it might get me shot
Look at my face, I don't give a fuck, squeeze and fire your Glocks
Ain't no reason trying to stop me even if I die, I'ma pop
So hold your tongue, the soldier's come so you're over, done
Just as you go to run I showed a gun and you froze up, son
I threw it away and punched you in the face
I'm something no human should face, I'm just a stupid kid losing his brains

[Hook]
