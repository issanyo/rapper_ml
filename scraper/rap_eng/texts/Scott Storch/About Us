[Intro: Brooke Hogan & (Paul Wall)]
Boys talkin' down
On the sidelines watchin wishin' they was playin' the game we playin'
But it's all good though; Paul Wall
Brooke, what up baby?
What's it to you Paul Wall? Yeah (naw)
Now who's talkin? (naw)

[Chorus: Brooke Hogan + (Paul Wall)]
I see your lips movin, but I don't hear nothin (naw)
Everybody talkin' like they really know somethin 'bout us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know baby, they don't know about it)
I see your lips movin', but I don't hear nothin (naw)
Everybody's talkin' like they really wanna know about us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know about you baby, talk to 'em Brooke)

[Verse 1: Brooke Hogan]
I'm just tryin to live, but you're all up in my grill
How's a girl to breathe with the media
Starin down my mouth, with a fo' inch lens?
I just wanna hit the mall with some of my friends
And I need to clear my mind
'Cause they're driving me insane
I be switchin' lanes down 95
Swervin' in my E-class, sunroof popped
With my stunner shades on
'Cause the haters won't stop, no!

[Chorus: Brooke Hogan + (Paul Wall)]
I see your lips movin, but I don't hear nothin (naw)
Everybody talkin' like they really know somethin 'bout us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know baby, they don't know about it)
I see your lips movin', but I don't hear nothin (naw)
Everybody's talkin' like they really wanna know about us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know about you baby, talk to 'em Brooke)

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do?
I hear the commentators on the side chatterboxin'
Paul Wall and Brooke got all the paparazzi watchin'
I hear 'em jaw-jappin, bumpin gums, chasin' crumbs
We ain't concerned with the bums, we accumulatin' funds
Flash the wrist, got the Johnny Dane watch froze
Five karat with the yellow stone in my earlobe
I'm squashin chatter when the light hit the pinky ring
Starched and clean, white cup full of lean
See me in that new Benz cause I'm also ballin
Or a old school slab with the fifth wheels fallin'
We got 'em talkin', but really they ain't sayin' too much
Just speculatin' with they gossip
Truth is, they don't know about us

[Chorus: Brooke Hogan & Paul Wall]
I see your lips movin, but I don't hear nothin (no)
Everybody talkin' like they really know somethin 'bout us
They dont know about us, they don't know nothin' 'bout us
They don't know about us
I see your lips movin', but I don't hear nothin (naw)
Everybody's talkin' like they really wanna know about us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us

[Bridge: Brooke Hogan]
Stop stop stop! I'm not listening, you can save your breath
I don't wanna, hear the rumors people are spreading
Why, why, why do people go, out of their way
To try to bring us down, they don't know nothin 'bout us

[Chorus: Brooke Hogan + (Paul Wall)]
I see your lips movin, but I don't hear nothin (naw)
Everybody talkin' like they really know somethin 'bout us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know baby, they don't know about us)
I see your lips movin', but I don't hear nothin (naw)
Everybody's talkin' like they really wanna know about us
(They don't know baby) But they don't know nothin 'bout us
(They don't know about you baby)

[Outro: Paul Wall]
They don't know baby, naw {*to fade*}
