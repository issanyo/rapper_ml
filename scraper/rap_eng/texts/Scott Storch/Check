[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
What you gon’ be, I’m gon’ be the best
I’m from the east but I'm in the west
Out on Sunset, I got a TEC
I run a bitch up, look at my neck
I’m in a foreign, ain’t got a learners
Smokin’ biscotti, bitch that’s word to Berner
I ain’t got not diplomas, bitch look at my earners
Put her in a coma, see her in the mornin’
We got the flame, we got the torch
Scotty 2 Hotty, bitch that’s [?]
What you gon’ do when the ball in your court?
This is a Wraith, bitch don’t open my door
We load the miss then we got to war
Shoot me a nigga and pour me a four
Fendi my fit, our I might do Dior
You know that I'm nice, had a trap at the store

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
Blow 50 thousand just to flex (yeah)
Another 100 on my neck (yeah)
Gettin’, gettin’ to the check (yeah)
We gettin’, gettin’ to the check (yeah)
Pounds flyin’ from the west (yeah)
Bitches fuckin’ on the chat (yeah)
Gettin’, gettin’ to the check (yeah)
We gettin’, gettin’ to the check (yeah)

[Verse 2: Berner]
I’m for the [?], I buy me an O
Turn it around, I just buy me a boat
I’m in Japan, 300 a gram
Rock with my fam will keep a bitch broke
Throw me a lo, bring me a brick
We double up quick, I don't need me a friendship
Just come with the cash, Maybach with the stash
I never finish school but I’m good at math, yeah
Ask Glizzy, this shit look pretty
It’s 5 grand a piece when it hit your city
[?]
Rather die broke than let a hoe bitch kiss me
I just blew a cool buck fifty on the bussdown, homie
I celebrate everytime I touchdown, homie
Street shit it don't get much realer
More money fill another big wheeler

[Chorus: Shy Glizzy]
Blow 50 thousand just to flex (yeah)
Another 100 on my neck (yeah)
Gettin’, gettin’ to the check (yeah)
We gettin’, gettin’ to the check
Pounds flyin’ from the west
Bitches fuckin’ on the chat
Gettin’, gettin’ to the check (yeah)
We gettin’, gettin’ to the check
Blow 50 thousand just to flex (yeah)
Another 100 on my neck (yeah)
Gettin’, gettin’ to the check (yeah)
We gettin’, gettin’ to the check
Pounds flyin’ from the west
Bitches fuckin’ on the chat
Gettin’, gettin’ to the check (yeah)
We gettin’, gettin’ to the check
