[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you say "baby, I love you"
If you aren't runnin'
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kind of shady, ain't calling me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say "baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, my name
Say my name, my name

[Verse 1]
Any other day, I would call
You would say "baby, how's your day?"
But today ain't the same
Every other word is "uh-huh, yeah, okay"
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
And if you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
So prove yourself to me, I'm the one that you claim
Why don't you say the things you said to me yesterday

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know that you said that I'm assuming things
If something's going down, that's the way it seems
It shouldn't be the reason why you actin' strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there, then tell me who

[Chorus 1]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say "baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin'
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kind of shady, ain't calling me baby
Why the sudden...?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say "baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game (oh, no)
Say my name, my name

[Verse 2]
I know they say that some things are better left unsaid
And it wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
Oh, no, no
All of these things people told me keep messing with my head
You should've picked honesty, then you may not have blown it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But you don't have to say just what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance for you and me
And there'll never be
So don't it make you sad
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me, all alone
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me, on the phone
Girl I refuse, you must have me confused with some other guy
Your bridges were burned
And now it's your turn to cry

[Chorus 2]
So cry me a river
Just cry me a river
Just cry me a river (oh, no)
Just cry me a river
Cry me, cry me

[Bridge]
You say yeah, yeah
You say yeah, yeah
You say yeah, yeah
You say yeah, yeah
I say no, no
You say yeah, yeah
I say no, no
You say no, no, no

[Chorus 1]
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say "baby, I love you"
If you aren't runnin'
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kind of shady, ain't calling me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say "baby, I love you"
If you aren't runnin' game, oh no
Say my name, my name

[Outro]
Say my name then cry me a river
(My name)
Say my name then cry me a river
(My name)
Say my name then cry me a river
