Baby I was flexin' for the 'gram
And you came along and I had a Change of Plans
Got me like...
(Singing)

Tell me if ya' seen her (ya' seen her)
Oh, how I wants to meet her (to meet her)
It's hard to speak when it's 'bout you
I can't even think when it's 'bout you
Oh, what you puttin' on (puttin' on)
I can tell it's on (that it's on)
You know how to pose fo' da flixture
I like how you boomerang your picture
Ain't nothin' to tell me (to tell me)
50 on cologne so you can smell me (me)
60 you can hit me on the phone (phone)
900 I wanna' bring you home

Baby I was flexin' for the 'gram
And you came along and I had a Change of Plans
Got me like...
(Singing)
Baby I was flexin' for the 'gram
And you came along and I had a Change of Plans
Got me like...
(Singing)

Is you gon' charge me fo' the feature
And act like you 'ont know me wen I see ya'
Girl I know you own it (ya' own it)
'N you know I know this (I know this)
I'ont wan' play you or despite you (you)
I just wanna' tell you that I like you
Tell me what is wrong (what is wrong)
What is going on (going on)
I'ma take a stand here without you (you)
'N I'm still the man here without you

Baby I was flexin' for the 'gram
And you came along and I had a Change of Plans
Got me like...
(Singing)
Baby I was flexin' for the 'gram
And you came along and I had a Change of Plans
Got me like...
