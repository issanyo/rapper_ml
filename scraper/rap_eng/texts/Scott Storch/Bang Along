[Chorus]
One for the impalas, two for the gold D's
Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side
One for the impalas, two for the gold D's
Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side

[Verse 1]
Yo, I used to dribble the rock down the block in '94
Shoot the courts out when Killer Wayne brought that Porsche out
I had the illest jump shot so he bet all his money on me
12 years old with the hunnies on me
Patrick Ewings on, I kept the fresh kicks
Take a nigga out his Jordan's if the motherfuckers fit
They fit so I'm back up the block
Fuckin' with the homies tryin' to teach them how to slap box
In front of the crack spot
Fiends fightin' over crack rock
Dimes the size of golf balls, yeah, them shits was that hot
He had them black Locs like MC Ren
And Deebo came through in the hood in that coke-white Benz
Before 106 & Park and 24 inch rims
Before these corny nigga's kept the stickers under they brims
It was a little nigga in Compton, five foot ten
He was dope as a motherfucker, I wanted to be like him

[Chorus]
One for the impalas, two for the gold D's
Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side
One for the impalas, two for the gold D's
Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I ain't gon' lie, homie
I used to do the Hammer Dance
Make it worse, I had steel toes on and hammer pants, fucked up right?
That's when my pops had the weight
He had to blow while I was blowin' in Nintendo tapes
Got my ass whooped for takin' the Duck Hunt gun outside
In my window watchin' all the kids have fun outside
Ice cream truck makin' noise, I want to run outside
But I'ma get my ass whooped again if I run outside
Swear I was on punishment until my tenth grade year
This new girl move on the block, light skin with wavy hair
I asked her did she want to hump me, she was like, "I don't care"
So I took off her training bra, that's when she got scared
She wanted me to be her boyfriend, so I was like, "Yeah"
I'm tryin' to think of LL lines in the back of my head
"When I'm alone in my room," I can't remember what he said
But I know Uncle Luke, bitch give me some head
It go...

[Chorus]
One for the impalas, two for the gold D's
Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side
One for the impalas, two for the gold D's
Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side

[Verse 3]
Shit, I'm grown now
Pops in jail, I'm on my own now
Got my first kilo and my brick phone now
Two door Cutlass, sittin' on that chrome now
Headed to the county jail, two T's comin' home now
Yeah, homie, shit changed, nigga's don't bang like they used to
And I can't dunk like I used to
Nigga's don't move fast enough when they hear the *WOO WOOP*
And takin' fades is played out like Fubu
I got a TV in the dash watchin' Friday
21, no felon, tell them niggas, "crime pay"
Red rag in my pocket, doin' it my way
Two switches, so the Cutlass bounce sideways
Four amps, 15's beatin' the trunk
Try to jack me for my shit? Gotta beat me to the pump
Punk
I'm on my gangsta shit
Nigga wit' a attitude on my motherfuckin' gangsta shit

[Chorus]
One for the impalas, two for the gold D's
Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side
One for the impalas, two for the gold D's
Three for the switches, middle finger for the police
Nigga wit' a attitude, I will not let it die
Four fingers up, two twisted for the West Side

[Outro Talking]
Hey Low, I'm a take these nigga's back man
Back to the number 4 Jordans, nigga, them shits were sway
Remember those motherfuckas?
We had the number 4 Jordans, man
When the new shits got old, we couldn't afford the new ones, man
So we want to motherfuckin' Payless and got that black shoe polish
Put so much shoe polish on them motherfuckas tryin' to keep them shiny black that them motherfuckas turned leather!
Or like when the motherfuckin' ice cream nigga came through
I remember the nigga name, it was Hector, man
And he would come through in the ice cream truck
And got all the motherfuckin stickers on the ice cream truck
Like he just ballin' crazy out the game
This nigga got stickers of motherfuckin' ice cream sandwiches
Strawberry short cakes, UFOs, Motherfuckin' big sticks
Then you ask this nigga do he got any of them motherfucka's he talkin' about
All he got is Now & Laters
What the fuck you in an ice cream truck for then, Hector?
Get the fuck out of here, man
Look at these niggas now man
All these funny clothes and jackets
And all fuckin' little..
This lookin' fuckin' crazy, man
I'mma keep it gangsta on these nigga's, Low
Nigga's can't fuck with me, man
I'm a on that motherfuckin' 1990
Straight Outta Compton
Express Yourself, Eazy E, Jerry Curl drippin'
MC Ren, black loc straight out the swap meet
Dr. Dre black Khaki's black tee shirt
Motherfuckin' gold rope around my neck
DJ Yella Raider motherfuckin' hat to the back
Ice Cube suck my motherfuckin' dick shit
Bitches
