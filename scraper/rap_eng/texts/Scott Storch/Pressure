[Intro: Belly]
Let's go, Yeah
I'm back man
For the first time
I see that look on your face
Come on

[Chorus: Ginuwine]
I think they feel the pressure {4X}
I know they feel the pressure {4X}
Nowww!

[Verse 1: Belly]
Swear to god I'm about to blow
I'm coming in y'all going out the door
You can hate you can doubt the floor
But tell the whole globe it's about to snow
Broads cause with the deals of cheddar
I ain't involved if ain't a mill or better
You feel the pressure, I know you do
Roast is rove as I overdue
I do it how you suppose to do
Get rich before rap no loans or crew
I'm with the crow flow a little promo do
Stones looking like a million little photo shoots
Maybe that's why all the models stop
Same time to draw and the pride is dropped
They feel the pressure like bottle tops
Right before the bottle pop
Owww!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Belly]
It's Belly boy get the name right
I paint life you can ask what my game like
Get introduced in the daylight
Seduce and not Bruce in the same night
Girls kill for a hem
That's me the new day feel more slim
I have you sweating till you feel more slim
If you wanna feel less them then feel more him (I knowww)
I have to win that's right whole life full of acronyms
ED on the chest, CP on my chest
AC on the seats, TV in the deck
SLR couple GTs in the S
DVD when I speak, 200 Gs on my neck
It's B do you feel the pressure yet
I'm MJ what do you seck his left
Yesss!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Ginuwine]
It's plain pressure and I know you feel it
Got you freaking got you bouncing
So we like it like that
Belly and Ginuwine and we just won't stop
Say ohho woaho ohh (ohho woaho ohh)
Say ohho woaho ohh (ohho woaho ohh)
We got bottles popping
Females doing what they wanna do and they can't stop screaming
So we like it like that
Belly and Ginuwine and we just can't stop
Say ohho woaho ohh (ohho woaho ohh)
Say ohho woaho ohh (ohho woaho ohh)

[Chorus]
