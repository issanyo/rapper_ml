[Intro]
What do you do
When you know something's bad for you
And you still can't let go?

[Verse 1]
I was naive, your love was like candy
Artificially sweet, I was deceived by the wrapping
Got caught in your web and I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed and devoured completely

[Chorus]
Oh, and it hurts my soul 'cause I can't let go
All these walls are cavin' in
I can't stop my sufferin'
I hate to show that I've lost control
'Cause I, I keep goin' right back
To the one thing that I need
To walk away from, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I need to get away from you
Need to walk away from you
Get away, walk away, walk away

[Verse 2]
I should have known that I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke, it was all an illusion
Now I've been lickin' my wounds, but the venom seeps deeper
We both can seduce, but darlin', you hold me prisoner

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm about to break, I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm feindin' for a cure
Every step I take leads to one mistake
I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need, oh
I can't mend, this torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn?
And everywhere I turn
I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need
To walk away from, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I need to get away from you
I need to walk away from you

[Bridge]
Every time I try to grasp for air
I am smothered in despair it's never over, over, oh
It seems I'll never wake from this nightmare
I let out a silent prayer let it be over, over, ooh
Inside I'm screaming, begging, pleading no more, ah-ah

[Verse 3]
I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad, but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

[Chorus 1]
Ooh, it hurts my soul 'cause I can't let go
All these walls are cavin' in
I can't stop my sufferin'
I hate to show that I've lost control, 'cause I
I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm about to break, I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm feindin' for a cure
Every step I take leads to one mistake
I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need, oh
I can't mend, this torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn?
And everywhere I turn
I keep goin' right back to the one thing that I need
To walk away from, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I said I need to get away from you
Need to walk away from you (ooh)
I need to get away from you
Need to walk away from you
I need to get away from you
Need to walk away from you (only thing I need to do)
I need to get away from you
Need to walk away from you
I need to get away from you (is walk away from you)
Need to walk away from you
I need to get away from you (yeah)
Need to walk away from you
I need to get away from you (walk away)
Need to walk away from you
I need to get away from you (walk away)
Need to walk away from you
Get away, walk away, walk away (ooh)
