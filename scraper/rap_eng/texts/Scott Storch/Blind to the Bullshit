[Chorus]
More commas, I just want more guala, yeah (more guala)
(I’m blind to the bullshit)
My vision blurry, and we livin’ in a hurry though (in a hurry)
(Yeah, I’m blind to the bullshit)
Let em’ talk, we call shots up top, bitch (on top)
(Yeah, I’m blind to the bullshit)
I’m in my own lane, yeah I do my own thang (own thang)

[Verse 1]
Fuck the drama, I don't wanna hear none of that (none of that)
Shout out to the gang, we runnin’ that (runnin' that)
Where my duffle at? That's gon’ be a hundred flat (hundred flat)
We bust a play, pray we safe, and then we run it back
Fake friends smile in faces, I got sick of that (so sick)
Now everybody wanna favor (is that right?)
I just opened up the FoodSaver (opened up the FoodSaver)
Yeah we rollin’ up the new flavors
Yeah, shout out to my haters, I'm just chillin' in Jamaica, smokin’
Yeah, they wanna bust my head open, 'cause they bread bad
They ain't doin’ good,  I got a .40 on me, shit I wish you would
I’m in my own lane, I'm tryin' to do my own thang
Old school, candy paint, yeah with the gold thangs
Drunk drivin', yeah we takin' up both lanes
I'm blind to the bullshit, but we be with the bullshit, Bern

[Chorus]
More commas, I just want more guala, yeah (more guala)
(I’m blind to the bullshit)
My vision blurry, and we livin’ in a hurry though (in a hurry)
(Yeah, I’m blind to the bullshit)
Let em’ talk, we call shots up top, bitch (on top)
(Yeah, I’m blind to the bullshit)
I’m in my own lane, yeah I do my own thang (own thang)

[Verse 2]
Fuck the drama, yeah, tonight I’m on my own hype (my own hype)
And we don’t stop at no lights (none of them)
My game cold like a fresh block of snow white (like a fresh brick)
They miss my old price, that shit was so nice (it was on)
Why they got they hands out like some low lifes?
They should get they money up, go and buy some grow lights (c'mon)
Put some money in your pocket, do right fam' (right fam')
And your blessed, I got homies doin' life man
You never know when your life ends
Big stack with the FN on the night stand (on the night stand)
They try and throw me off track, I need that white sand
Beach full of freaks, we havin’ drinks out in Thailand (yeah)
Yeah, you really gotta have vision
If you worried bout them, then you ain’t gon' get it (you won't)
If you worried bout them, then you ain’t really livin’ (you ain't livin')
.30 with the full clip and we be with the bullshit

[Chorus]
More commas, I just want more guala, yeah (more guala)
(I’m blind to the bullshit)
My vision blurry, and we livin’ in a hurry though (in a hurry)
(Yeah, I’m blind to the bullshit)
Let em’ talk, we call shots up top, bitch (on top)
(Yeah, I’m blind to the bullshit)
I’m in my own lane, yeah I do my own thang (own thang)
