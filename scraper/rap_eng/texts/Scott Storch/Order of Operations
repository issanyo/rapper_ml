[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Wake up, fresh, crease, jeans, get to the fucking money
Roll up, smoke, pour up, drink, right back to the money
Pull up, stunt, turn up, leave, more motherfucking money
Go hard, go home, wake up, repeat, order of operations
Order of operations

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
So what if I told ya that I was a cold soldier
That give 'em the cold shoulder? These hoes been getting over
On these niggas like Olympic hurdle jumpers
They trying to get that Gold, portfolios diverse
This type of paper just don't fold
Or get throwed in the booty club flexing
With hootie hoo them hoes and have them glued to the section (HOOTIE-HOO) Ain't nothing new, that's just us oozing perfection
Been stacking up, clipping this paper like Mary Lou Retton
While nigga be stressing about this money, I retire my dear mama
Been fucking up some commas way before I could buy a bottle
Of liquor, looking like the lotto my nigga, but we don't flash it
I balled throughout my twenties, by thirty, see I was stashing, yeah

[Interlude]
First hundred-thousand, I bought a Lexus
First million, I was twenty, I learned my lesson
I bought some land
Operation Grind and Stack

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger (Big Boi)]
Wake up, fresh, crease, jeans, get to the fucking money
Roll up, smoke, pour up, drink, right back to the money
Pull up, stunt, turn up, leave, more motherfucking money
Go hard, go home, wake up, repeat, order of operations
(Grind and stack, grind and stack, grind and stack, grind and stack)
Order of operations
(Grind and stack, grind and stack, grind and stack, grind and stack)

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
I took advantage of my shot and now it's raining
Bucket just like Mo Williams, fuck your cancer vaccinations
Plantation mentality making a laughable salary
That'll never be me but that's you in actual reality, uh
I'm King Cole like Natalie and her daddy be
My thing swole, pole dancers, shit, they be adding me
On IG, they gon' DM, we gon' act like we don't see them
They just follow us, follow me, follow us, nobody's leading
But everybody eating, or acting like they full
I'm blessed and highly favored, learned the game when I was lil'
I guess it's time to stake my claim and conquer every hood
Help my partners get this number too by sponsoring the juug
Yeah!

[Interlude]
If I eat, everybody eat; that's just how it go, day one
Dungeon Family first generation, still here

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger (Big Boi)]
Wake up, fresh, crease, jeans, get to the fucking money
Roll up, smoke, pour up, drink, right back to the money
Pull up, stunt, turn up, leave, more motherfucking money
Go hard, go home, wake up, repeat, order of operations
Order of operations
Order of operations
(Grind and stack, grind and stack, grind and stack, grind and stack)
(Grind and stack, grind and stack, grind and stack, grind and stack)
(Grind and stack, grind and stack, grind and stack, grind and stack)
(Grind and stack, grind and stack, grind and stack, grind and stack)
