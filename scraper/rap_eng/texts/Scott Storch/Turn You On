[Verse 1]
Everybody's looking at me
But that's alright, I like attention
The clubs not hot, until I walk through
They stop and stare and watch me move

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Like, damn!, (I like that), I'm sexy and you know it
Clap your hands (oh, it's like that)
I'm not afraid to show it, understand
Yeah, I'm hot, bitch
Don't be mad at me, go check your man
Girls and boys are looking at me
I can't blame 'em, 'cause I'm sexy

[Chorus]
Don't care who's watching me, I do just what I want
Just 'cause I dance with you, don't mean your getting some
Don't get excited, baby, 'cause I might turn you on
Turn you on, turn you out
Give 'em something to write about

[Verse 2]
All the boys are looking up at me
As I dance on the table top
Tonight, I'll be your liquid dream
They want a piece of what I got

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They be like, "Damn!" (I like that)
"She's sexy and she's shaking all on me." (it's like that)
"I'm hot, and I can't take it, I need a drink."
(Yeah, I'm hot, bitch!)
"She's cooler than I ever thought she'd be."
Girls and boys are looking at me
I can't blame 'em 'cause I'm sexy

[Chorus]
Don't care who's watching me, I do just what I want
Just 'cause I dance with you, don't mean your getting some
Don't get excited, baby, 'cause I might turn you on
Turn you on, turn you out
Give 'em something to write about

[Bridge]
Don't dance too close, I might turn you on
Don't try to impress me, my papers long
Don't believe all that you read my shit out loud
We can dance all night, but you ain't getting none, none
Sorry I turned you on
Take a cold shower when you get home

[Pre-Chorus (Shortened)]
Girls and boys are looking at me
I can't blame 'em cause I'm sexy

[Chorus]
Don't care who's watching me, I do just what I want
Just cause I dance with you, don't mean your getting some
Don't get excited, baby, 'cause I might turn you on
Turn you on, turn you out
Give 'em something to write about
