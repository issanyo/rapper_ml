[Verse 1]
I don't really mind taking out all of the trash
If I gotta change the tire outside in the pouring rain
Nothing but a thang, I'm gonna, gonna provide
Go and get that bread bring it home, do what I gotta
And I never think twice about it, no

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a trooper, your rider
When you need me to
Steady grindin' out, gettin' dirty
Ain't scared to break a nail or two
Always on the hustle tryin' to get it
Do what a man would do
But sometimes I gotta remind myself

[Chorus]
I'm still a woman
Still need a little love, still need a man's touch
That's sensitive enough to make me feel like a woman
Sometimes I need a shoulder, someone to take me over
Make me stop and smell the roses 'cause I'm still a woman
And I wouldn't have it any other way

[Verse 2]
Put on a smile every single time
I be goin' through some drama
Brush it off then I head to the gym
Hit on a bag for about an hour
They see these lips (my thighs), these hips (these eyes)
These lines, under-estimating you from the jump
That's why I never let 'em see me cry

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a trooper, your rider
When you need me to
Steady grindin' out, gettin' dirty
Ain't scared to break a nail or two
Always on the hustle tryin' to get it
Do what a man would do
But sometimes I gotta remind myself

[Chorus]
I'm still a woman
Still need a little love, still need a man's touch
That's sensitive enough to make me feel like a woman
Sometimes I need a shoulder, someone to take me over
Make me stop and smell the roses 'cause I'm still a woman
And I wouldn't have it any other way, no, no, no
And I wouldn't have it any other way, no, no

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm just like my mother
She never takes out the time for herself, only for others
Make me I deserve a bubble bath
A day at the spa, get a massage and a mud bath

[Chorus]
I'm still a woman
Still need a little love, still need a man's touch
That's sensitive enough to make me feel like a woman
Sometimes I need a shoulder, someone to take me over
Make me stop and smell the roses 'cause I'm still a woman

I'm still a woman
Still need a little love, still need a man's touch
That's sensitive enough to make me feel like a woman
Sometimes I need a shoulder, someone to take me over
Make me stop and smell the roses 'cause I'm still a woman
Woman, that's what I am, that's what I am
