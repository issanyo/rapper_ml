Well, I stepped in twelve o'clock feeling like a million bucks
Diamonds shining off of my cuffs
Then I saw an angel out of the blue
A certified stallion, body made of porcelain
Had to get my mind right to holla what it do

Then you looked up with those green eyes
So captivating, so motivating
You might not know me but I wanna show you
I can give you what you need

I'm about to be out
So go on tell me what it is
What it is, what it is
Are you gonna be out with a guy
Standing around with your friends
What it is, what it is
Tell me what the business is

Are you thirsty, you wanna wet your throat before we go
Let's creep to the bar take a shotta XO
Maybe it'll help us loosen up, guaranteed to get us right
We can two step to the door
I think I found what I came here for
I don't wanna wait a minute more
We've wasted half the night

When you walked by with those thick thighs
So captivating, so motivating
Go on and take my hand, show me that you're comfortable
Let me give you what you need

I'm about to be out
So go on tell me what it is
What it is, what it is
Are you gonna be out with a guy
Standing around with your friends
What it is, what it is
Tell me what the business is

My seven fifties waiting
I'm waiting when you are
I see you girl
My ice can get a ticket
We need to make a move
Cause time is of the essence, baby

I'm about to be out
So go on tell me what it is
What it is, what it is
Are you gonna be out with a guy
Standing around with your friends
What it is, what it is
Tell me what the business is

I'm about to be out
So go on tell me what it is
What it is, what it is
Are you gonna be out with a guy
Standing around with your friends
What it is, what it is
Tell me what the business is
I gotta know what the business is
