[Chorus]
Maybe I should call
Maybe not
Maybe I should leave
Maybe not
Maybe I should go
Maybe not
Maybe I can't take you that serious
Maybe I should call
Maybe not
Maybe I should leave
Maybe not
Maybe I should go
Maybe not
Maybe I can't take you that serious

[Verse 1]
I was in Atlanta
She was 19
I was only 20
She was tryna scheme
She had nightmares
Me I had dreams
She had wants
Me I had needs
I don't like to chill
Yeah I like to fuck
I don't pop pills
Yeah I get drunk
Just throw it back
TBT
Every Sunday like CCD
You knew me back when
Before the back-ends
I made your back bend
Ooh
Now there's a husband
But you don't fuck him
Cause you don't love him
Ooh

[Chorus]
Maybe I should call
Maybe not
Maybe I should leave
Maybe not
Maybe I should go
Maybe not
Maybe I can't take you that serious
Maybe I should call
Maybe not
Maybe I should leave
Maybe not
Maybe I should go
Maybe not
Maybe I can't take you that serious

[Verse 2]
Its been four long years since I seen you
Wouldn't wanna be you
Its been four long years since I left you
But I ain't forget you
So you pull up on me cause I say so
You still broke I'm paid though
Downtown buckhead bad latina from the block like J-Lo
All my chips got Queso
Yeah I'm tryna rub it in
Whole lotta money been comin' in
Im'a come up I don't know if you should come again

[Chorus]
Maybe I should call
Maybe not
Maybe I should leave
Maybe not
Maybe I should go
Maybe not
Maybe I can't take you that serious
Maybe I should call
Maybe not
Maybe I should leave
Maybe not
Maybe I should go
Maybe not
Maybe I can't take you that serious
