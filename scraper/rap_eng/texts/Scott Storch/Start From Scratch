[Intro: Flowz Dilione]
Aye
If I could start from scratch
Go back, do it all again
I wouldn't change a thing brah
It made me who I am today
Strong and Loyal, it is what it is man

[Verse 1: Flowz Dilione]
If I could start from scratch I wouldn't change shit
Same mum and dad, same bro, same sis
Same neighbourhood, same school, same kids
The same motherfuckers that I came up with
The same old friends man, same old bitch
In the back of the whip sucking on my dick
The exact same court case, same old snitch
Same finger pointin at me, same old pigs
The same empty cupboard, no food in the fridge
Same old clothes man same old kicks
The same old house that I was raised in
If I could go back man I'd do the same things
The same old good deeds, same old sins
The same blade going into Ariol's ribs
The same black TNs, same old tick
Cause without none of that man I wouldn't be shit

[Hook: Game - Start From Scratch]
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
X2

[Verse 2: Dwizofoz]
If I could start from scratch, there's a few things I would change
I woulda made more time for my good mates
And woulda never look past the fact I knew Strooth was puffin on that pipe
Lyin to myself like "nah, it can't be that"
I don't know what I'd do different
All I know is that it don't feel the same on stage without you with us
If I could free all my brothers I would
Provide for their families, make sure their mothers are good but
If I could only change one thing
I woulda made more songs that made mum sing
And never let my mother cry I heard that shit hundred times
If I ever meet Darryl Turner again that cunt'll die
I swear to god I've never spoken a truer word
I'll do the things to him I should've never let him do to her
If I could start from scratch I'd start with that
And tell my mum I love her to the stars and back
I love you mum
