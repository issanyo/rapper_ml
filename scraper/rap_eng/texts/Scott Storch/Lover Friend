[Intro]
You know emotion
It's more than just love, it's a friendship

[Verse 1]
Shawty, hold up, what's your name
I see you tired of the same shit
Baby, if you wanna sing
Got it for you any day
We been moving low key
Baby, and it's okay
Baby, and it's okay
Okay

[Pre-Chorus]
You more than lust and sex
You my friend

[Verse 2]
Shawty, all she wanna do is turn up
Sipping on tequila
Shawty, slow down 'fore you slip up
Girl, I got a blunt that we can burn up
He just mad cause it never really was his turn, huh?
Baby, yeah, we can go wherever you like
It's just something 'bout you I actually like
When I don't got time, and you still at home
It makes things hard, girl, I know, know, know
I let you in my heart and took it personal
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
You more than lust and sex
You my friend
