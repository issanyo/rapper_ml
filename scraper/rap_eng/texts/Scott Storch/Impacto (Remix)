[Letra de "Impacto (Remix)" ft. Fergie]

[Coro: Daddy Yankee, Fergie]
Give it all you got shorty, make the impacto
Give it all you got shorty, make the impacto
(Welcome to the remix!)
Give it all you got mami
(Fergie Ferg and Daddy Yankee, bitches!)
Give it all you got mami
Give it all you got mami, make the impacto

Give it all you got shorty, make the impacto
(Daddy! ¡Por ahí viene el castigo!)
Give it all you got shorty, make the impacto (Oh!)
Give it all you got mami (¡Cartel!)
Give it all you got mami (The Big Boss!)
Give it all you got mami, make the impacto

[Hook: Daddy Yankee, Fergie]
Hey!, so what? You goin' down mama
Hey! So why don't you break it down mama?
Do it! (Hit me!)
I like the way you do it! (Hit me!)
You like the way I do it? (Hit me!)
I like the way you do it!

[Verso 1: Daddy Yankee]
Enseña to' lo que tienes, el golpe avisa, no te detiene
Este choque no hay quien lo detiene, aunque nos tire la ley
Salvaje, vine rebelde, el leon sale hasta que te muerde
Tú sabes que tengo un partner, no perdamos este break
El golpe bien duro te pega
Así es que pega
Yo sé que así te lo vives
El choque es electrico, magnetico, perreo cybernetico (Yeah!)
Estás calentandote, yo calentandome
Me dice "¿Que pasa aqui?, eso lo quiero ver"
"¿Que pasa cuando te pego duro contra la pared?"
Se produce el impacto, baby just...

[Pre-Coro: Daddy Yankee, Fergie]
Wind it up!
Just wind it up!
Just wind it up!
Just wind it! (Let's go!)

Grind you up!
I could grind you up!
I could grind you up!
Baby grind it! (Let's go!)

[Hook: Daddy Yankee, Fergie]
Hey! So what? You goin' down mama!
Hey! So why don't you break it down mama?
Do it! (Hit me!)
I like the way you do it! (Hit me!)
You like the way I do it? (Hit me!)
I like the way you do it!

[Coro]
Give it all you got shorty, make the impacto
Give it all you got shorty, make the impacto
Give it all you got mami, give it all you got mami
Give it all you got mami, make the impacto (¡Muevelo shorty!)

Give it all you got shorty, make the impacto
Give it all you got shorty, make the impacto (¡Nos fuimos lejo', ma'!)
Give it all you got mami, give it all you got mami (Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!)
Give it all you got mami, make the impacto

[Verso 2]
No resbala, cuando te acorrala
Tú matas la liga como Dallas, mira si eres mala
Que me pegas la cintura de ule
Para que me cure dando palos como los azules
Raymond Ayala, el que nadie iguala
¡Y no para!
Ya hice que sudara, toda esa ropa cara
Estamos dando a la calle el estilo del barrio, dale mami, just...

[Pre-Coro: Daddy Yankee, Fergie]
Wind it up!
Just wind it up!
Just wind it up!
Just wind it! (Let's go!)

Grind you up!
I could grind you up!
I could grind you up!
Baby grind it! (Let's go!)

[Hook: Daddy Yankee, Fergie]
Hey! So what? You goin' down mama!
Hey! So why don't you break it down mama?
Do it! (Hit me!)
I like the way you do it! (Hit me!)
You like the way I do it? (Hit me!)
I like the way you do it!

[Coro]
Give it all you got shorty, make the impacto
Give it all you got shorty, make the impacto (¡Muevelo shorty!)
Give it all you got mami, give it all you got mami
Give it all you got mami, make the impacto (¡Muevelo shorty!)

Give it all you got shorty, make the impacto
Give it all you got shorty make the impacto (¡Nos fuimos lejo' ma!)
Give it all you got mami, give it all you got mami (Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!)
Give it all you got mama, make the impacto

[Verso 3: Fergie]
You know what happens when I step into the place
I'm Fergalicious, brothas wanna get a taste
But they know I ain't promisciuous
The realest chick up in this but ladies don't know the real from the fake
You got a problem? Come and say it to my face!
You got a problem? Come and say it in my face! (Say it in my face!)
Fergie Ferg make an impact, I'ma pull your wig back
Fellas like the way I move my waist

[Hook: Daddy Yankee, Fergie]
Hey! So what? You goin' down mama!
Hey! So why don't you break it down mama
Do it! (Hit me!)
I like the way you do it! (Hit me!)
You like the way I do it? (Hit me!)
I like the way you do it!

[Coro]
Give it all you got shorty, make the impacto
Give it all you got shorty, make the impacto (¿¡Que pajo shorty!?)
Give it all you got mami, (Fergie!) give it all you got mami (Daddy Yankee!)
Give it all you got mami, make the impacto

Give it all you got shorty, make the impacto (¡Cartel!)
Give it all you got shorty, make the impacto (Nosotros revolucionamos la música)
Give it all you got mami (You know who's this)
Give it all you got mami
Give it all you got mami, make the impacto

[Outro: Daddy Yankee]
Da-ddy Yan-kee!
