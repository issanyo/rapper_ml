Yeah, it's Chris Webby
203 where you at? (We right here)
Yeah, it's like that
DJbooth.net (scratch that) exclusive
Let's get it poppin' (scratch that)

Cause every time I get on the mic, and I start reciting, or writing
I'm like a Titan, ain't nobody fuck with that
Poppin' vicodin, and fighting, striking, and biting
Quicker than lightning every time that Webby gets up on the track
Cause you know I done it, I kick it, pun it, and bun it
Step to me and you'll get punished cause I'm always spitting crack
Split a couple dutches, get blunted even though I'm so broke
I had to get fronted the money for the twenty sack
Baby, I'm a killa, with microphones who is realer?
I eat em like quesadillas every time I'm coming through
My skin may be vanilla, but I'm iller than any other spitta
You heard of recently, and that's just how I do
Cause you know I rap it, cause havoc over the Atlas
Someone needs to open my brain up and tighten up the screws
Talent, yes I have it, I'm magic, puff it and pass it
Cause I'm spittin' on the mic until my face is fully blue
Pick it up and drop it, I rock it no one can stop it
I pop it, lock it, no one can ever copy what he does
Rock on any topic while coppin' exotic product from the tropics
That will leave me a very solid buzz
Cause everyday I'm twistin', it's my mission for Christian
To blow up like nuclear fission when I'm pullin' up the rug
From under your feet while hitting your vision with the rhythm
Kick flipping over you motherfuckers and pulling bud
Cause you know I'm going and steady showin' you that my flowin' is potent
Cause I am always spittin' out the truth
Notoriety growing and white as the ocean
You could try to be boasting but I'll knock you out your boots
Cause you know I do this, making music so fluid
I'm barely lucid but I drop it baby and here is the proof
Cause this is the movement, I'm bruising my competition
While hitting them with the exclusive only for DJ Booth
I'm practically the best, DJBooth.net
So check the context, I'm wrecking these little punks
Don't even break a sweat while I hit them from the right to the left
Grind for my checks, with CDs in the trunk
Music's what I do, til I'm through I'll be true
From my head to my shoes because I'm never the type to stunt
Crack open a brew, have them saying "pee-yew!"
Cause I got that Pepe Le Pew, I'm rolling up the skunk
Baby I'm a villain, George Foreman grilling, whore killing
Everything I'm winning cause Webby could never lose
Until I got a million I'll be spilling my wisdom
Over any track that I'm given, and that's why I am that dude
That every kid in Connecticut's learned to respect
So all you haters hit the deck or you'll be leaving with a bruise
The next white hope, so step or get wrecked
Success is my destiny that I choose
