[Verse 1]
We treat change like trophies, cash like tissue
Keep a strap so them cats with the masks don't get you
Live fast, ya, my past, all this shit I been through
Got my bag right (bag right, bag right)
Ya, we rockstars, we race cop cars (cop cars)
We smoke weed, sip lean, and we pop bars (pop pills)
All black hoodie, I don't fit in no Gucci
More money, more people gon' sue me (fuck 'em)
I'ma end up in the feds (rest in peace)
Or somebody will shoot me
Bury me in the garden next to all of the [?]
I'm a legend with the bag
I'm in Spain with the limoncello (I'm in Spain)
A million dollars square cut, ya thats real dinero
You see the way the money power got 'em trippin' out (trippin' out)
Checked in, rolled a joint, then they kicked me out (gone)
A few things in life I couldn't live without (couldn't)
A trap house, I'm a king when I'm in a drought (king)

[Pre-Chorus]
We ain't never put up with no disrespect
Kill the middle man, I'm the real connect
Water drippin' on my wrist, it got your bitch wet
We don't dance in the club, we do the money flex

[Chorus]
Got two hundred in the bar, that's a flex
We got weight on deck, that's a flex
We don't wait for the check, that's a flex
We don't dance in the club, we just flex
Got two hundred in the bar, that's a flex
We got weight on deck, that's a flex
We don't wait for the check, that's a flex
We don't dance in the club, we just flex

[Verse 2]
We treat hundreds like pesos (like pennies), M's like dollars
Benji's like Hondas, just bought a house for my daughter
Far away from the snakes and the piranhas
The three letter boys they keep a close eye on us
Fuck sittin' in the cage, I'm paid
I bought a boat for my maid in Montego Bay (here you go)
I just bought a crib in Marin
They hate to see us win, fucker cut your eyes out then
I think she like the way I flex, 'cause I stack different (stack different)
I hate it when it when I get the call that the pack missin
They wanna burn another bridge, well that's bad business
They got me out in Atlanta on my last mission, for real

[Pre-Chorus]
We ain't never put up with no disrespect
Kill the middle man, I'm the real connect
Water drippin' on my wrist, it got your bitch wet
We don't dance in the club, we do the money flex

[Chorus]
Got two hundred in the bar, that's a flex
We got weight on deck, that's a flex
We don't wait for the check, that's a flex
We don't dance in the club, we just flex
Got two hundred in the bar, that's a flex
We got weight on deck, that's a flex
We don't wait for the check, that's a flex
We don't dance in the club, we just flex

[Outro]
"One thing I hate is square bitches. They hate me. I hate you bitches too. And the thing is, they think they're better 'cause they fuck dudes after the club, they suck raw dick, you know and they think it's poppin' to have a land of babies by random motherfuckers that get on the county and get that EBT and shit, and that section 8 and shit. Bitch, first of all, I would never be you because I suck dick with a motherfuckin' condom. Yes, bitch, I'm sucking on motherfuckin' rubber, bitch. And I'm not gettin' no STDs, bitch, while you out here fuckin burnin'. Bitches, how you have a million followers, and you ain't got a million dollars. That's what I fuckin' ask myself when I see you bitches spreadin' your motherfuckin' pussy and ass and titties on Instagram for motherfuckin' likes and you ain't got no money.  Always askin' me, "How do you do it, how do you do it?" Bitch, open your fuckin' mouth and ask for the motherfuckin' money 'cuz these tricks is payin'. Left and right, per stroke."
