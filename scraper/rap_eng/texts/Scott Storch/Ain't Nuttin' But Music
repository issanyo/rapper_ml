[Intro]
La la la la la la
La la la la, la
La la la la la la, la
Hahahahaha

[Verse 1: Eminem]
It's shit like this I kick to these rich white kids
Who just might see how fucked up this sick life is
Oops, I did it again, didn't I?
My shit's harder to figure out than what Britney's tit size is
Ooh, I probably pissed you off again, didn't I, bitch?
So what? Christina Gaguilera kiss my grits
You know how many shits I give? I wish I did
So I can quit giving these twisted little kids ideas
This just in: Britney just dissed Justin
She just fucked Ben, got tit-fucked and dick-sucked him
If Affleck can get his ass licked, how come I can't?
Shit, god damn, bitch, I'm rich, I can't understand this
Are those pictures I made of us together on the internet
As close as I'm ever gonna get to hitting it from the back?
And shit, when it comes to that, I hit harder from the back
Than Everlast when he's plugging Lethal in his fucking ass
Just give me one more chance, Britney hit me one more time
Let me know what's on your mind, Whitney give me one more line
To sniff, you fuckers know what time it is
Fuck your jewelry, my record's almost diamond, BEEOTCH!

[Chorus: Eminem]
What's going on in the world today?
People fighting, feuding, looting, it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre! (It ain't nuttin' but music)
What's going on in the world today?
People fighting, feuding, looting, it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre! (It ain't nuttin' but music)

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
Eminem doesn't like N'Sync, well I do
So fuck him, and the Backstreet Boys too
Whatever happened to the cast of Diff'rent Strokes?
Gary's broke, Todd's snorting coke, and Dana overdosed (aw!)
I got two little boys with me
Michael Jackson sent two helicopters to get me (Hee! Hee!)
I'm up early with my hair curly
Me and Mr. Furley, fucking Laverne and Shirley

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
A lot of rappers are living in la-la land
That's why I let my dogs out on the Baha Men
As bad as a life I had, I'm not mad
I don't need to be a Jackass to beat up my dad
My whole family's country, my grandmother's old fashioned
And she keeps asking me why I rap with a honkey
But granny I'm a flunky, I could be a junkie
I could be hanging with the hoochies out at the club scene

[Bridge: Kon Artis]
To all the independent women in the house! (Hooouse!)
Show us your tits and shut your motherfucking mouth! (What?!)

[Verse 4: Proof]
Robert Downey, Bobby Brownie, Whitney Houston
The shit she's using
Jesse Jackson, reverend scandal
Got George Michael's, Tevin Campbell's
Pee Wee Herman's, peep show places
Public restrooms, peep those cases!

[Chorus: Eminem]
What's going on in the world today?
People fighting, feuding, looting, it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre! (It ain't nuttin' but music)
What's going on in the world today?
People fighting, feuding, looting, it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre! (It ain't nuttin' but music)

[Verse 5: Swift]
Your mom and dad probably mad at us (for what?)
We done turned their kids into little body snatchers
Ain't like where I'm from, we don't bite our tongue
Are you sure you want niggas 21 to carry guns?
It's sad but I'm glad that I'm made to rhyme
Where you work you ain't getting paid for that overtime
It's only music, media know it but they blind
I ain't in y'all life, so stay they hell up outta mine! (Nigga)
Y'all the reason why Princess Diana ended up dying
If you people get offended I don't care (stop crying!)
Trying to get us to leave cause what we say just ain't clean (uh, uh)
But holding back on what I say just ain't me

[Verse 6: Kon Artis]
Now what's these parents all mad for?
"Your music is bad for 'em"
For teenage kids that drink more than Ted Danson in Cheers
Carson drink beers, we all fart and piss and cuss out our bitch (SHUT UP!)
Broke or rich, I still do that same old shit
I don't jump in front of a camera and change no shit
So when they ask me about my sarcasticness
I just slap 'em, turn around and ask them this

[Chorus: Eminem]
What's going on in the world today?
People fighting, feuding, looting, it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre! (It ain't nuttin' but music)
What's going on in the world today?
People fighting, feuding, looting, it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre! (It ain't nuttin' but music)

[Outro]
La la la la la la
La la la la, la
La la la la la la, la
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh
[Kuniva]
Look out for the D12 R&B album coming out soon
Straight R&B, straight R&B, straight R&B
Jodeci, we got you!
