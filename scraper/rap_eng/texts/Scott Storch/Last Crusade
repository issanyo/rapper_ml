[Intro]
Yeah, I like that. You know what this sound like?
It sounds like the Bible if it had a soundtrack. Church

[Verse 1: Bishop Lamont]
Forgive me if I nod off snorin'
But hip hop right now is fuckin' borin'
Since The Miseducation I've been missin' Lauryn
For yo information you should stop performin'
And even think about fuckin' tourin'
It should be a crime how these rappers rhyme when they recordin'
Get the death penalty bitch, no call from the warden
No stay execution, electrocution I'm warnin'
It's been night too long, it's time for the mornin'
See, life goes on so enough with the mournin'
Yeah, I miss Pac and I miss Big
But that don't mean that I should bite they shit
If y'all not fags why y'all ridin' they dicks

[Hook]
Cause it's west coast bitch, bustas, hustlas, hoes
Pimps, playas, gangstas, know
Bishop Lamont, war dogs, let's go
It's a brand new movement now
All that west, is no more now
It's been burned down to the ground
No more masquerade
Time to rearrange the game
All these rappers sound the same
Hooks and beats are just so lame
It's the last crusade

[Verse 2: Bishop Lamont]
Yeah, these rap niggas actin' like these basketball niggas
Ain't concerned with the game, just the ball figures
You ain't Larry, you ain't Magic, you ain't Jordan bitch
You ain't Run, you ain't Kane, you ain't Slick Rick
Your album ain't a classic cause it got a few hits
Or got crazy spins and you got rich
Allow me and I'll enlighten you stupid pricks
I'm real, I bypass the collar tricks
I don't know who's the bigger fuckin' fool
The consumer or the dude that they listenin' to
The dude for tellin' that lie or believin' it's true
Nigga, R. Kelly raps fuckin' better than you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bishop Lamont]
I was preordained to exercise the game
I'm makin' church every time nigga hears the name
So hallelujah, he's so much cooler
I'mma hold down the west like Fidel reps Cuba
No I'm not a Blood and no I'm not a Crip
It don't even matter I'll bust yo lip
And if you bust that chit chatter 'bout that thing on your hip
Know that I'm so gangster/Gang Starr I keep an extra clip
To keep me +Safe & Sound+ like DJ Quik
But I'm on a higher level fuck that rah rah shit
I'm here to shake the devil with the truth that I spit
And remind these niggas if they ass forget

[Hook]

[Outro]
It's a brand new movement now
