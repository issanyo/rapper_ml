V1

You became a sleep walker
Don’t hold it back girl
You should know that

I’ll awaken your heart now
We’re night and day give me
The chance to prove it baby

Pre

I’ll be breaking night just to fly to you
Baby wasting time I would never do
I stay up for the moment
Feelings I can’t control now

Hook

Don’t sleep love away
Girl I feel your pain
The reason you may
Keep on Sleep Walk-
Keep on, keep on
Sleep Walking

V2

Girl they made you
A sleepwalker
Doing you wrong, you’re doing bad yeah

From them breaking, your heart now
We’re night and day give me the chance to prove it baby

Pre

I’ll be breaking night just to fly to you
Baby wasting time I would never do
I stay up for the moment
Feelings I can’t control now

Hook

Don’t sleep love away
Girl I feel your pain
The reason you may
Keep on Sleep Walk-
Keep on, keep on
Sleep Walking


Bridge

And I’m Lost when you’re froze
Im with you in the cold, and now
Trees fallin down
(Caught fallin)
And Mistakes that you made
In the past it’s ok, you know
We’ve all been down
Been down n
I can’t describe
The emotion that’s pullin
And I know the feeling of dealin
With Rivaaals
And we’ve been unconscious
But not outta options
Cuz I’ve been
Dreamin up these
Feelings for
You


Hook

Don’t sleep love away
Girl I feel your pain
The reason you may
Keep on Sleep Walk-
Keep on, keep on
Sleep Walking
