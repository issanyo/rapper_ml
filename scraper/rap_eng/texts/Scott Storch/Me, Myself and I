[Intro]
All the ladies, if you feel me
Help me sing it out

[Verse 1]
I can't believe I believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive for me
To think he was from your past
Silly of me to dream
Of one day having your kids
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong

[Verse 2]
I can't believe I fell for your schemes
I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe
That with you I'm a changed man
Foolish of you to compete
When I cheat with loose women
It took me some time
But now I moved on
Because I realized I got

[Chorus]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend

[Verse 3]
So controlling, you said
That you love me but you don't
Your family told me
One day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing
With some problems of my own
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong

[Verse 4]
Now that it's over
Stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front
Like you're still with me
All your girlfriends know
Even your very best friend
Tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time
But now I am strong
Because I realized I got

[Chorus]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend

[Bridge]
(Got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(You must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me
Help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me
But I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain
You'll see the sun come out again

[Break]
Yea-ea
Oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh
Whoo-ooh
Whoo-ooh-ooh!

[Chorus]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
