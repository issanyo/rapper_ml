[Verse 1]
I remember when it all first began
We were tight right from the start
It wasn't long before you came on strong
Trying hard to win my heart (try to win it)
I played hard to get
But I couldn't help but give up my heart in the end
You were thoughtful
Careful not to hurt the relationship

[Pre-Chorus]
What happened to those days
When you used to be compassionate
Caring what I thought and said
So attentive; a gentleman
Now it's hard to turn your head away from the TV set
Taking me for granted lately
And frankly, it's gotta quit

[Chorus]
Ooh, I feel underappreciated
Now girls, help me out if you know what I'm talking about
I said, ooh, I'm feeling underappreciated
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment

[Verse 2]
Lets take it back again to the very beginning
When our love was something new
Back when romance was important
Not just another thing to do
I was feeling high on love's delight
Thought I'd never come back down
Now it seems that you and me have lost our solid ground

[Pre-Chorus]
After time, I realized I seem to give more than I get
Funny how things seem to change after a few years commitment
Used to talk for hours on end of our dreams while we lay in bed
I miss those days when you stayed awake
Now you roll over and snore instead

[Chorus]
Ooh, I feel underappreciated (I feel)
Now girls, help me out if you know what I'm talking about
I said, ooh, I'm feeling underappreciated
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment

[Bridge]
I miss the nice massages
The long phone calls
And the way you talk
How it'd turn me on
Miss the bubble baths, had the sweetest laughs
I'm needin' those days back

[Chorus]
Ooh, I feel underappreciated
Now girls, help me out if you know what I'm talking about
I said, ooh, I'm feeling underappreciated
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment
I feel underappreciated
If you feel me, sing it with me
Oh, come on, help me out
I'm feeling underappreciated
