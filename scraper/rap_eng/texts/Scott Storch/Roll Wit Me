[Verse 1]
I don't wanna waste your time
With some kind of playa line
But I need to know some things about ya
One; do you have a man you claim?
Are you doing your own thang?
'Cause if so then I can't leave without your name
Or your number, where you live
Can I call you sometime?
Wait a minute, better yet I'll give you mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what your interests are
Who you be with
Your ideal man — can I be it?
Let me know before you go
'Cause I just won't take no

[Chorus]
Baby I wanna do
Whatever's on your mind
You'll make it all come true
(Baby) If you roll with me tonight (Baby)
Baby, I want to do
Whatever's on your mind
You'll make it all come true
If you roll wit me tonight

[Verse 2]
You make a brother wanna do
Things I never thought I'd do
Got me open and I'm hoping, baby
I can take you for a ride
Bentley's right outside
You can make it happen
If you just tell me your name
And your number, where you live
Can I call you sometime?
Wait a minute, matter fact I'll give you mine
I'll give you mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what your interests are
Who you be with
Your ideal man — can I be it?
Let me know before you go
I just won't take no, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, I wanna do
Whatever's on your mind
You'll make it all come true
If you roll with me tonight (Baby)
Baby, I want to do
Whatever's on your mind
You'll make it all come true
If you roll with me tonight

Baby, I wanna do
Whatever's on your mind
You'll make it all come true
If you roll with me tonight
Baby, I want to do
Whatever's on your mind
You'll make it all come true
If you roll with me...

[Bridge]
Come on and roll
I don't wanna stress ya
All I wanna do is get next to ya
Oh, I wanna be the man that makes you feel
Like no one else can
Oh, I don't want to stress ya
All I wanna do is get next to ya
Want you to give it all to me
I wanna be the one that sets you free
Come on and roll

Ahh Ahh You You
Ahh Ahh You You
Ahh Ahh You You
Ahh Ahh

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what your interests are
Who you be with
Your ideal man — can I be it
Let me know before you go
'Cause I just won't take no

[Chorus]
Baby, I wanna do
Whatever's on your mind
You'll make it all come true
If you roll with me tonight
Baby, I wanna do
Whatever's on your mind
You'll make it all come true
If you roll with me tonight

Baby I wanna do
Whatever's on your mind
You'll make it all come true
If you roll with me tonight
Baby I wanna do
Whatever's on your mind
You'll make it all come true
If you roll with me tonight
