[Intro: French Montana]
I got some money to spend, aye aye
I got some money to spend
I got some money to spend
I got some money to spend
I got some money to spend

[Pre-Chorus: T.I. & French Montana]
Man young having money poppin', not the bat
I'ma hop out on the net
For my city for the bet (bet)
Bad bitches, bust it down
All waves are automatic
Got the drinks, got the pounds
Why you playin' with the dabs though?

[Chorus: French Montana]
Stop it (aye), Stop it (aye), Stop it (aye)
Stop it (aye), Stop it (aye), Stop it (aye)
Stop it (aye), Stop it (aye)

[Verse 1]
I got purp by the liter
I got pounds in the duffle
I got cash in the freezer
We don't clash in the huddle
Bottles with the dope, hot
Smokin' dope, lean, work bust it open
Hit the block, then I hit the jeweler
Wrist, bust it open

[Bridge: French Montana]
Tip Tip Tip Tip Tip Tip Tippy Top
Models got the bottles
Tip Tip Tip Tip Tip Tip Tippy Top
Bad bitches, marble floors
Tip Tip Tip Tip Tip Tip Tippy Top
Magic City, calm it down
Hit Atlanta, me and TIP

[Verse 2]
Bust it open, want it freaky
Yeah she want it on the top
And all my diamonds VVS, she bust it open in her feelings

[Pre-Chorus: French Montana]
Man young having money poppin', not the bat
I'ma hop out on the net
For my city for the bet (bet)
Bad bitches, bust it down
All waves are automatic
Got the drinks, got the pounds
Why you playin' with the dabs though?

[Chorus: French Montana]
Stop it (aye), Stop it (aye), Stop it (aye)
Stop it (aye), Stop it (aye), Stop it (aye)
Stop it (aye), Stop it (aye)

[Bridge: French Montana]
Tip Tip Tip Tip Tip Tip Tippy Top
Models got the bottles
Tip Tip Tip Tip Tip Tip Tippy Top
Bad bitches, mob the floors
Tip Tip Tip Tip Tip Tip Tippy Top
Magic City, calm it down
Hit Atlanta, me and TIP

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Blue cheese, revenue
I got big stacks sitting on the avenue
And when these suckas violate man, I hate to do it, but I still get 'em whacked for a band or two
And nigga really though? I ain’t going back and forth with you, we ain’t on no tennis court
And nigga talk big, when you still know how to bid it though
Ain't wanna let down
Yeah heh, and nigga warning, danger
Yeah, give they ass what they came for
Shooter totin' them flamethrower
Known to hit what they aim for
Cocaine lord, Marijuana Don
This watch of mine is a 1 of 1
Got a hundred stacks, of a hundred ones
Plus a hunna hunnas
Binding stacks on another
I keep it a hunna for a hunna bands
I seen felons turn they backs on one another
Sister shoot her brother, mother killed her daughter
Man this shit is awful

[Pre-Chorus: French Montana]
Man young having money poppin', not the bat
I'ma hop out on the net
For my city for the bet (bet)
Bad bitches, bust it down
All waves are automatic
Got the drinks, got the pounds
Why you playin' with the dabs though?

[Chorus: French Montana]
Stop it (aye), Stop it (aye), Stop it (aye)
Stop it (aye), Stop it (aye), Stop it (aye)
Stop it (aye), Stop it (aye)

[Bridge: French Montana]
Tip Tip Tip Tip Tip Tip Tippy Top
