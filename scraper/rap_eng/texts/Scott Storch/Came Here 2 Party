[Intro: Joker]
Tell me' something my friend
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight? (What?
I always ask that of all my prey... I just like the sound of it

[Intro: Live Performance]
Everybody on the floor, put ya hands up
All my fellas to the left, put ya hands up
To all my bitches on the right, put ya hands up
Now scream

[Intro]
Blood money
Fast cars
Dope money
Rap stars

[Verse]
It's been an wild adventure
Stepping into the wildest game
Meeting the devil and others things that I will not name
One thing is straight: I popped out of the fire in the blue
Never stop, won't flop - topping the game? 100 too
Fifty shades and they all black
Fifty one in the crew' mane - with no Jack
Fifty two, man I count stack - till 55 I'm on that
Tick tock, tick tick - the time's ticking so fast - I gets quick
Ego's growing so fucking fast from each and every hit
Each time I decide to call any fucking bitch
It doesn't even matter, as long as I'm gettin' the cheddar
I'm just playing, it's who do you voodoo pressure
2Shaddy in the game... (Forever)

[Chorus]
I came here to party
I came here to play
The world was so naughty
There's nothing left there to stay

You came here to party
You came here to play
My world is so naughty
There's nothing to say

[Verse]
All styles, I'm conceited now
Living bulletproof, the truth is I'm breezy now
Calling shots with top quap, they cannot see me now
On to a billion, I won't stop believe me now
Sixty hundreds on my fucking lap
Sixty more by night time, just to mention that
Sixty two while I'm on the track
Money, money, money and everybody be hating that
The heck you expect, it's worldwide - I get it live
With lack of respect, you just a flex - I'mma show you
Who's next, just move that body till I fly and injure the rest
I'm coming (ooo) I'm coming right now
It won't be long, till this song start playing in ya town
The hottest (the hottest) my style's breaking it down
This earth? Shit, I'm taking it down - listen to me now

[Chorus]
I came here to party
I came here to play
The world was so naughty
There's nothing left there to stay

You came here to party
You came here to play
My world is so naughty
There's nothing to say
