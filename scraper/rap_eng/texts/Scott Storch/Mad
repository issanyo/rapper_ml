[Hook]
Hit the Gucci store and make you mad, mad
Hopped up out the wraith ain't tryna brag, brag
Suicide doors, suicide yah
I'm just doing me so why you mad, mad

[Verse 1]
Young supreme, Daytona beach, you know it's me
Top back on my 95 so you notice me
If you ain't talking bags, don't hit my phone, what's the point
Ask around cause I run my town, yeah I'm the boss
You can catch me creeping, crawling through the night
If you see me, got a biddie by my side
Got 'em all big, man they hating on me
Told them send bottles all night, fuck sleep, fuck sleep, yeah

[Hook]
Hit the Gucci store and make you mad, mad
Hopped up out the wraith ain't tryna brag, brag
Suicide doors, suicide yah
I'm just doing me so why you mad, mad

[Verse 2]
Flexin' on them, just flexin' on them, like Ric Flair
Diamonds on them, just shining on them, they love to stare
Brought the Gucci fit just to take a pic, do it for the gram
Got the duffle bags supreme, you feel, with a hundred grams
You can catch me creeping, crawling through the night
If you see me, got a biddie by my side
Got 'em all big, man they hating on me
Told them send bottles all night, fuck sleep, fuck sleep, yeah

[Hook]
Hit the Gucci store and make you mad, mad
Hopped up out the wraith ain't tryna brag, brag
Suicide doors, suicide yah
I'm just doing me so why you mad, mad
Hit the Gucci store and make you mad, mad
Hopped up out the wraith ain't tryna brag, brag
Suicide doors, suicide yah
I'm just doing me so why you mad, mad
