V1

I look back when I first saw
The first time I missed your call
You left me a message sayin
The World don’t revolve around you

Now you’re at the open bar
Cahsing all the fancy cars
Swiping all the credit cards
Your games ain’t nothin new

Pre

With all eyes on your body
Cuz all eyes on you
And all eyes on your body
And you’re still playing these games

With all eyes on your body
Cuz all eyes on you
Don’t think you
Can fool me
With games that you do

Hook (x2)

And ahhh oh
Ahhhh
No you can’t play me now
No you can’t play me now

V2

Don’t play no games
I’m telling you
Don’t play no games
I see you
Don’t Play no games
Can’t handle you
And don’t mess around
I’m telling you

Pre

With all eyes on your body
Cuz all eyes on you
And all eyes on your body
And you’re still playing these games

With all eyes on your body
Cuz all eyes on you
Don’t think you
Can fool me
With games that you do

Hook (x2)

And ahhh oh
Ahhhh
No you can’t play me now
No you can’t play me now

Bridge (x2)

Ohh oh oh oh oh
Got me saying

Hook (x2)

And ahhh oh
Ahhhh
No you can’t play me now
No you can’t play me now
