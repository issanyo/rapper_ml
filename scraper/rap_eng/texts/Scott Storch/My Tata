[Verse 1]
Temptin', addictive
This is, somethin' that it's gotta be
Let's just dance, no distance
Persistence, that body gotta hold of me
You're freakin', through the weekend
Don't you dare hold out on me

[Pre-Chorus]
In that sundress you're glowin'
Let's just live in the moment
Don't waste no time, go for it
Be lovers at war

[Chorus]
Take her back to mi casa
In the sheets you a freak
Swear it's something bout her
You’re killing them, and don’t even try to
I’m looking for my wifey, my Tata
This chemistry the perfect nostalgia
Make a scene ain’t no movie without ya
You play so hard to get but you flirt
Yo quiero just you

[Verse 2]
At first sight mi amor baby
I never thought that was true (no)
Who frame so picture perfect
She got the moves so special
Got me mesmerizing
Sex on Virgin Islands
Nighttime in a daze (days)
Listening to the waves

[Pre-Chorus]
In that sundress you’re glowing
Let’s just live in the moment
And not waste no time, and go for it
Be lovers at war

[Chorus]
Take her back to mi casa
In the sheets you a freak
Swear it's something bout her
You’re killing them, and don’t even try to
I’m looking for my wifey, my Tata
This chemistry the perfect nostalgia
Make a scene ain’t no movie without ya
You play so hard to get but you flirt
Yo quiero just you

[Pre-Chorus]
In that sundress you’re glowing
Let’s just live in the moment
And not waste no time, and go for it
Be lovers at war

[Chorus x2]
Take her back to mi casa
In the sheets you a freak
Swear it's something bout her
You’re killing them, and don’t even try to
I’m looking for my wifey, my Tata
This chemistry the perfect nostalgia
Make a scene ain’t no movie without ya
You play so hard to get but you flirt
Yo quiero just you
