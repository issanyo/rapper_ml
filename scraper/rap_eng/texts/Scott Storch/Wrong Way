V1

Why do you wanna wait until I’m gone
Why do you wanna wait until tomorrow
All I’m thinking about when I listen to you
When I drink in the morning it’s all cuz of you

Pre

I stayed by your side and I don’t owe you why
But I think that I’m losing control and I
Can’t run away
(oh oh)

We’re going the wrong way

Hook

Woah oh oh
Baby why you love me the wrong way
(dragging me out the door, I can’t take no more)
Woah oh oh
Baby can’t you love me the right way
(dragging me out the door, I can’t take no more)

Post (x2)

Hooo hooo hooo ooo oooo
And I’m done with you

V2

I’ve moved in the wrong directions in my life
I made some tough decisions with my life
Why you throwing shade on me
Wy don’t you let me live my life no more
No More


Pre

I stayed by your side and I don’t owe you why
But I think that I’m losing control and I
Can’t run away
(oh oh)

We’re going the wrong way

Hook

Woah oh oh
Baby why you love me the wrong way
(dragging me out the door, I can’t take no more)
Woah oh oh
Baby can’t you love me the right way
(dragging me out the door, I can’t take no more)

Hooo hooo hooo ooo oooo
And I’m done with you

Bridge

You don’t see my love you don’t
See my side, you make it
Seem like it’s all me
You don’t care no more
I can see
What you do
You dropped the ball
On it


Hook

Woah oh oh
Baby why you love me the wrong way
(dragging me out the door, I can’t take no more)
Woah oh oh
Baby can’t you love me the right way
(dragging me out the door, I can’t take no more)
