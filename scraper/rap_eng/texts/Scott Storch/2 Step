Uh, uh, oh
Uh, uh, oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, oh [2x]

[Beyonce]
I'm feelin' way too cool tonight
Got my hat cocked to the right
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat, just slide
Back and forth, side to side
Back it up, I don't want to grind
Slow down and take your time
When I move my hips just right
Lead the way out of line

[Chorus]
Fly girls, get your 2 step on
Pimps and players, get your 2 step on
All my G's, get your 2 step on
Sexy ladies, get your 2 step on
Pretty girls, get your 2 step on
Hustlers, get your 2 step on
All my thugs, get your 2 step on
Classy ladies, get your 2 step on

[Kelly]
Lookin' way too fly tonight
Catchin' all them sneaky eyes
I can tell you fantasize, starin' up and down my thighs
When I shake, ya dancin' right
I know it's just the way you like
Be a gentleman, act polite
Lead the way and I'll oblige

[Chorus]
Fly girls, get your 2 step on
Pimps and players, get your 2 step on
All my G's, get your 2 step on
Sexy ladies, get your 2 step on
Pretty girls, get your 2 step on
Hustlers, get your 2 step on
All my thugs, get your 2 step on
Classy ladies, get your 2 step on

Uh, uh, oh
Uh, uh, oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh

Such a crazy feeling
Let the music hypnotize you on the floor
As we dip and slide so cool, to the rhythm
Let the magic magice happen, sing along

Dressin' up, sexy people having fun
Shoes is new, don't scuff 'em up
Take your time and enjoy yourself

[Chorus]
Fly girls, get your 2 step on
Pimps and players, get your 2 step on
All my G's, get your 2 step on
Sexy ladies, get your 2 step on
Pretty girls, get your 2 step on
Hustlers, get your 2 step on
All my thugs, get your 2 step on
Classy ladies, get your 2 step on

(Clap your hands)
Break it down, give it in
Side to side, back and forth, then do it again
[4x]

[Chorus]
Fly girls, get your 2 step on
Pimps and players, get your 2 step on
All my G's, get your 2 step on
Sexy ladies, get your 2 step on
Pretty girls, get your 2 step on
Hustlers, get your 2 step on
All my thugs, get your 2 step on
Classy ladies, get your 2 step on
