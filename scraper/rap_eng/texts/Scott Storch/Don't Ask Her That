Intro: Shaggy

Uh! Yah hear mi, I an I mek yuh know seh
Certain tings yuh just don't waan know
Let it go! let it go! you don't wanna know
Let it go!

(Shaggy) (*Nicole Scherzinger)

How many men did you have? (Don't ask her that)
Can you count on one hand? (Don't ask her that)
Am I like your last man? (Don't ask her that)
(*We on a need to know basis and you don't need to know)
Back in the day were you a freak? (Don't ask her that)
In the past hey did you creep? (Don't ask her that)
How you so good between the sheets? (Don't ask her that)
(*We on a need to know basis and you don't need to know)

Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger
Go 'head do what you came to do
Wanna know all the things that I used to do
When I keep it on the real you get an attitude
You want the truth, you can't handle the truth
Go 'head do what you came to do
You want to follow my past well it's up to you
When I keep it on the real don't get an attitude
You want the truth, you can't handle the truth

Verse 1: Shaggy
Don't ask bout the past you should let some things be
No need to concern bout the man she has seen
You ask how many she tell you just three
Knowing that your ego can't handle thirteen
It's best not to ask bout her previous guys
Unless you are willin to handle her lie
Especially when she's discussin their size
You just might be in for a bigger surprise

Verse 2: (Shaggy)
You listen to me go a you really don't wanna hear
Your stirrin the feelings that you know you can't really bare
So what if the answer you can prevent your biggest fear
(Now ask yourself are you really prepared? Uh!)

Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger
Go 'head do what you came to do
Wanna know all the things that I used to do
When I keep it on the real you get an attitude
You want the truth, you can't handle the truth
Go 'head do what you came to do
You want to follow my past well it's up to you
When I keep it on the real don't get an attitude
You want the truth, you can't handle the truth

Verse 3: Shaggy
An expert it seems when it comes to foreplay
The many positions she did made your day
I know you must wonder how she get that way
Don't ask you might not wanna hear what she'll say
Just look in the past and the ways you had fun
Would you wanna know when the things you had done
She might lose her cool and be tempted to run
So what heave you learned when it's all said and done

Verse 4: (Shaggy)
You think of the info that you really don't wanna hear
Your stirrin the feelings that you know you can't really bare
So what if the answer you can prevent your biggest fear
(Now ask yourself are you really prepared? Uh!)

Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger
Go 'head do what you came to do
Wanna know all the things that I used to do
When I keep it on the real you get an attitude
You want the truth, you can't handle the truth
Go 'head do what you came to do
You want to follow my past well it's up to you
When I keep it on the real don't get an attitude
You want the truth, you can't handle the truth
