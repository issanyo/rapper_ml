[Chrous: Black Thought]
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Just think, what if you could just, just blink yourself away?
Just think, what if you could just, just blink yourself away?
Jeff X can rock the mic with tooth decay
I be the 5 foot 7, residing at the Mecca, rest address in south section
Used to cut class in the infinite pursuit of ass
Back in eighty-six
Easy with the chicks, I was a chocolate boy
Raised in the cellar with the rhythm like Ella
Walking mega-trife streets to the subway where I lay
Til the train stop, then a nigga hop
Used to do the pop dance to the Planet Rock
At the block party everybody jocked (Who me?)
It's the MC sucka niggas envy
I got my contract in 1993 and I shall proceed

[Chrous: Black Thought]
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
I wake up early in the morning, I mean early afternoon
Break a lyrical hymn of the stem like boom
I'm fly and when I die you'll put my shit upon my tomb
That nigga represented on the 28th of June
I'm representing Philly on the 28th of June
I can make you feel that I'm a surreal cartoon
With my pistol in the face of hip hop, stick it for papes
Because I'm on a paper chase, yes I'm on a paper chase
My Timberlands are fully laced I be the Mr. Boogeyman
With records from 125th to Japan
I let them play like Donny Hathaway and shake a hand, shake a hand
Your lady tried to kick it, but I couldn't play my man
My niggas is my niggas ya see she didn't understand
I shake your hand and shit'll hit the fan, just think
Just think, what? What if you could, just blink, what?
Just blink yourself away?
As I proceed

[Chrous: Black Thought]
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)

[Bridge: Black Thought and Malik B]
Malik B get on the mic yo there's too much on my mind
Say what?
Malik get on the mic, there's too much on my mind

[Verse 3: Malik B]
Johnny on the spot, got the rhythm and the rhyme
Fucking with The Roots, you know them niggas is the dime
I can make a hundred yard line start to dash
I can make a whole lake of fish start to splash
I can make Conan and the Titans clash
And I could make Metallica and Guns 'N' Roses thrash
Used to smash crash parties like I was disturbed
Used to make plots against the herringbone herb
But now, all I do disperse the verb
And like a nerd I can make you say, "He's superb"
Worded perfect, never ever shall you misinterpret
I move styles like bowels so now you know I'm worth it
Direct from Philly, the lands where niggas scheme
So you know I got the sheen in my gleam

[Chrous: Black Thought]
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
