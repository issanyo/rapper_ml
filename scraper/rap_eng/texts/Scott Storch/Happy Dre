[Verse 1]
She’s not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, I am
She’s not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, I am

[Pre-Chorus]
She’s well acquainted
With the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
Man in the crowd with the
Multicolored mirrors on his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes
While his hands are busy working overtime
A soap impression of his wife
Which he ate and donated to the National Trust

[Chorus]
I need a fix cause I’m going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause I’m going down
Going down, going down
I need a fix cause I’m going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix cause I’m going down
Going down, going down

[Verse 2]
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun

[Outro]
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun, mama
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun
Yes, it is
Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun, mama
