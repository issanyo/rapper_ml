[Verse 1]
Friday night ain't get here fast enough
Felt like forever
Now that its here I'm trying to live it up
Somebody told me this was the jumpoff
Ain't nothing better
So make room in V-I and fill up a cup with me

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been stressed out all week long
Get out my way (get out my way)
Don't even try calling my phone
No, not today (not tonight)
Don't wanna argue, fuss and fight
No, that's okay (no, that's okay)
I'm tryna hit the floor and dance my blues away
Hey hey

[Chorus]
Ain't come to hurt nobody
Just wanna do my (do my thang)
While I'm up in this party
Just wanna do my (do my thang)
Ain't come to hurt nobody
Just wanna do my (do my thang)
While I'm up in this party
Gonna do my thang (gonna do my thang)

[Verse 2]
Lil' mama stepped on my good shoes
I ain't even trippin' (that's not right)
Real divas don't stress on material things
(it's easily replaced)
Ain't nothing spoiling my good mood
(Hey, ma, what you sippin'?)
Playas, if you're buying, it's whatever
I'm chillin' (dance!)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been stressed out all week long
Get out my way (get out my way)
Don't even try calling my phone
No, not today (not tonight)
Don't wanna argue, fuss and fight
No, that's okay (that's okay)
I'm tryna hit the floor and dance my blues away
Hey hey

[Chorus]
Ain't come to hurt nobody
Just wanna do my (do my thang)
While I'm up in this party
Just wanna do my (do my thang)
Ain't come to hurt nobody
Just wanna do my (do my thang)
While I'm up in this party
Gonna do my thang (dance)

[Bridge]
I ain't come here for no drama (no drama)
All I want is to forget about my day
We can party all night long if you wanna
I don't care as long as I can do my thang, so...

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been stressed out all week long
Get out my way (get out my way)
Don't even try calling my phone
No, not today (not tonight)
Don't wanna argue, fuss and fight
No, that's okay (that's okay)
I'm tryna hit the floor and dance my blues away
Hey hey

[Chorus]
Ain't come to hurt nobody
Just wanna do my (do my thang)
While I'm up in this party
Just wanna do my (do my thang)
Ain't come to hurt nobody
Just wanna do my (do my thang)
While I'm up in this party
Gonna do my thang (gonna do my thang)
Ain't come to hurt nobody
Just wanna do my (do my thang)
While I'm up in this party
Just wanna do my (do my thang)
Ain't come to hurt nobody
Just wanna do my (do my thang)
While I'm up in this party
Gonna do my thang (gonna do my thang)
