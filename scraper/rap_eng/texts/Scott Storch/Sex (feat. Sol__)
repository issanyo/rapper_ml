I gotta show the other freaky side of me
Girl i wanna give you every inch you need
Jump up in my truck and let me take you there
Let me ride you thru the night
I'm a sexaholic and im cool with it
So let me eat the kitty till i'm thru wit it
Wanna see you shake it 'cause you lovin' it
The pleasures all mine

[Bridge]
I want to feel you close to me
And never will i let you go
The feeling of love is something that i need
And this is something that you gotta know

[Sol√©]
You see you already know tha kind girl i am
Need a mean long stroke and a video cam
Cherry bra high heels i ain't entice my man
Making love by the tub playing one of your jams
Then in front of the mirror watch me work the pole
Then i work you on the chair till i reach my goal
When i bring it to the floor let you take control
See me bend while you dig, see this thing is gold
My weakness, pretty niggas with big sticks
That do tongue tricks
Starring in our own porno flicks
Turn you on like a light switch
Hard as a brick
'cause you lovin how im moving it and its extra thick
I'll have you anywhere bed floor or chair
And you can spank me hard and pull my hair
You see its all for you i ain't the type to share
So you got dick for days and i got ass to spare

[Chorus]
I like it i love it
I want it all the time
(sex)
I crave it I needs it
Its always on my mind
(sex)
I like it i love it
I want it all the time
(sex)
I crave it I needs it
Its always on my mind
(sex)

I like it
I love it
Its always on my mind
