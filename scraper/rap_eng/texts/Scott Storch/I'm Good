[Verse 1]
Bet you remember how I
Used to put it down
When you used to be my baby
We used to hang out at the crib, boo
Could get around town till you switched the game up on me
You never realized what you had
Now that I'm gone, no I won't be back
And I can smile cause it's so funny
That's what you get for tryna do me shady

[Channel]
And I heard about the chick you had in my car
Should've known the day would come when you would get caught
Never thought that I would ever take it this far
But you know what, you should've stepped your game up
And you can't be mad now cause I'm on my G
I'ma play him the same way he tried to play me
Tell me how it's feeling now
You sitting lonely
Thinking bout me

[Chorus]
You know that I'm good
Shorty, we ain't gotta talk about it
Should get other guys
Man, I wish you would
Go and do that to somebody else
Don't try to run that bullshit on me
I'm good
Shorty, we ain't gotta talk about it
Should get other guys
Man, I wish you would
Go and do that to somebody else
Don't try to run that bullshit on me

[Verse 2]
And then he had the nerve to think that I'ma fall back
While he flaunts this chick in my face
But what he don't know is that I really don't care
I don't need that man for nothing
I got my own and I'm not concerned
Quit holding on, just let it burn
Can't trust you far as my eyes can see
Made up my mind and it's not changing, no no

[Channel]
And I heard about the chick you had in my car
Should've known the day would come when you would get caught
Never thought that I would ever take it this far
But you know what, you should've stepped your game up
And you can't be mad now cause I'm on my G
I'ma play him the same way he tried to play me
Tell me how does it's feel now
You sitting lonely
Thinking bout me

[Chorus]
You know that I'm good
Shorty, we ain't gotta talk about it
Should get other guys
Man, I wish you would
Go and do that to somebody else
Don't try to run that bullshit on me
I'm good
Shorty, we ain't gotta talk about it
Should get other guys
Man, I wish you would
Go and do that to somebody else
Don't try to run that bullshit on me

[Chorus]
You know that I'm good
Shorty, we ain't gotta talk about it
Should get other guys
Man, I wish you would
Go and do that to somebody else
Don't try to run that bullshit on me
I'm good
Shorty, we ain't gotta talk about it
Should get other guys
Man, I wish you would
Go and do that to somebody else
Don't try to run that bullshit on me

[Outro]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
But you know what
You shoulda stepped your game up, game up
