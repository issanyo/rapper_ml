Yeah, long live the kings
Uh Phil Ade
Yeah, Maryland

Uh yeah
I'm making moves drastic, who got the torch? Time to pass it
Every time I speak on the mic, fucking classic
Ducking traffic, 495 with a bad bitch
Conceited and greedy, can you blame me I never had shit
Had to make do, started doing shows for the low ... now I make two
Enough to cop a couple grey shoes
But I'm trynna take trips in December where it feel like late June
Late bloomer in the truest meanin', if you would've seen him back in '06
No one would listen, no one believed in what I had seen in myself
Except my niggas, so when I get it no one will get it except my niggas
Only nigga that figure he could be bigger than Jigga man
Jigga who? Jigga man yeah he a nigga too
You can't be afraid to aspire to be higher
I just did a show with Lupe, prior to that was choir
Apply the pliers to the competition if they in the way
Leader of the new school niggas, it's time to renovate
Time for dinner dates it's going out the window
Like smoke when I'm blowing out the endo, time to crescendo
Get louder, my amount of confidence has sky-rocketed
Still blow my money on clothes, never pocket it
Still not the talkative type
Still think I'm on a straight and narrow path just not walking it right
Still talking to Christ every morning every week
If there's another day of life, pound toast on the tweet
He either close to a beat or close to a female
Close to a dollar spend it most on retail
Time to pay attention pay the most star detail
Trying to steal the game on Friday, call me Ezal
Hit me on the email, stop give him a sellout
Cuz when I don't pickup they tell me I'm a sellout
Always thinking positive, love is what I shell out
Want the opposite then my nigga will send a shell out
Fuck you I'm trying to make my whole fam rich
Had to do some maturing I'm on my grown man shit
What
