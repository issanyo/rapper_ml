[Intro]
You got the lovin' that I need
You've got it
Baby let me plant a seed
I've got it
You got the lovin' that I need
You've got it
Your lovin' bring men to their knees

[Chorus]
That love, love, love
I'm missin' my love, love, love
Straight lovin', girl
Oh and I can't wait to see her
Your love made me a believer
And I won't fight these feelings anymore
I can't get enough of your love

[Post-Chorus]
Lo-o-o-o, lo-o-o-o-ove
Lo-o-o-o, lo-o-o-o-ove
Straight lovin', girl
Lo-o-o-o, lo-o-o-o-ove
Good lovin', girl
Lo-o-o-o, lo-o-o-o-ove

[Verse 1]
Girl, I'm bringin' everything I offer
If it's not enough, then tell me what you wanna
A chance to have your love would be an honor
Just know I bring the heat, like a sauna
I promise I will never bring the drama
Baby we can fix this, never be a runner
Go deep, deep, deep, deep, deep like a plumber
Then I knock, knock, knock, knock, knock it with my hammer, hey!

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby ,you're the love of my life
Girl, I need you right by my side
So baby, tell me what you're doin' tonight
Matter of fact, what you doin' for the rest of your life?
Roger that
I'll do anything just to see your smile
Roger that
For your love I would run more than a mile
Over any mountain, any ocean wide
I won't stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, 'til I get...

[Chorus]
That love, love, love
I'm missin' my love, love, love
Oh and I can't wait to see her
Your love made me a believer
And I won't fight these feelings anymore
I can't get enough of your love

[Post-Chorus]
Lo-o-o-o, lo-o-o-o-ove
Lo-o-o-o, lo-o-o-o-ove
Lo-o-o-o, lo-o-o-o-ove
Lo-o-o-o, lo-o-o-o-ove

[Verse 2]
Girl, I really hope you get this letter
You can never find a man weh love you better
And I can keep you warmer than a sweater
And anything you need, I'll go get you
I promise I will never leave you stranded
Angel, I love you from the very day you landed
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, like a Fiat
Have you huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, breathin' heavy, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you're the love of my life
Girl I need you right by my side
So baby, tell me what you're doin' tonight
Matter of fact, what you doin' for the rest of your life?
Roger that
I'll do anything just to see your smile
Roger that
For your love I would run more than a mile
Over any mountain, any ocean wide
I won't stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, 'til I get...

[Chorus]
That love, love, love
I'm missin' my love, love, love
Oh and I can't wait to see her
Your love made me a believer
And I won't fight these feelings anymore
I can't get enough of your love

[Bridge]
You got the lovin' that I need
Baby let me plant a seed
You got the lovin' that I need
Your lovin' bring men to their knees
Cause I won't stop
Until I get every last drop
Of your love, I won't stop
Until I get every last drop

Oh and I can't wait to see her
