You say that hes wrong you say that he's no good
Leave him alone cuz he's gona hurt you
But what they don't know is how he makes me feel
You say that he creeps always runnin the streets
He's playin the game and he'll never love me
You say that he's fake but why does it feel so real

No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think ima always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
No matter what your fearin its all in the past
No matter what your feelin this love is gon' last
The heart and the soul it breathes inside of me

My man (he makes me feel so special)
My Man (he makes me feel so precious)
My Man (he makes me feel wonderful)
My Man (im feelin so comfortable)

My man (he makes me feel so special)
My Man (he makes me feel so precious)
My Man (he makes me feel wonderful)
He's the guy oh he's my man

You say you dont trust him b/c he been locked up
You say that he's trouble cuz he out in the strip club
But you were young once so you should understand
You say that you know, so you been a witness
You say its for sure so he got a mistress
Until you can show me im gon' stand by him

No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think ima always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
No matter what your fearin its all in the past
No matter what your feelin this love is gon' last
The heart and the soul it breathes inside of me

My man (he makes me feel so special)
My Man (he makes me feel so precious)
My Man (he makes me feel wonderful)
My Man (im feelin so comfortable)

My man (he makes me feel so special)
My Man (he makes me feel so precious)
My Man (he makes me feel wonderful)
He's the guy oh he's my man
