[Intro: Beyonce (Ghostface Killah)]
Ahh, ahh, ahh all the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it now
(Uh-huh... Toney Starks..
Yo, baby, what's all this you telling everybody
We broke up and all this, I'm hearin' off the streets and all, that, ma
Talk to me or something, huh, I don't know what's goin' on, baby
You know, I got my clothes in the joint, and you go up here
Just packin' my gear --- what happened boo?)

[Beyonce]
I can't believe I believed, everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think, she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of, one day having your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for four years, and I'm smarter than that
So young and naive to believe that with me, you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete, when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on, cuz I realized I got

[Hook 2X: Beyonce]
Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend

[Beyonce]
So controlling, you said that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day, I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing, with your three kids and my home
I've been so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over, stop calling me, come pick up your clothes
No need to front like you're still with me, all your homies know
Even your very best friend, tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I got..

[Hook 2X]

[Hook 2X: Beyonce]
I got me, myself and I (I know that I would never dissapoint myself)
Must have cried a thousand times (all the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out)
I can't regret time spent with you (yeah, you hurt me but I learned a lot the long way)
But I lucked out to make it through (after all the rain you see the sun come out again)

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah *during hook*]
See that's why you in my life right now, smile right now..
I'm sorry, boo... I'm sorry..
Just you know, that you got mature... shoot..
Ya'll ladies keep your mouth shut right now
Cuz ya'll don't know what y'all talking about
This between me and her, that's my word, she just upset

[Ghostface Killah]
Changes... we all go through changes
Arguments, disagreements, and to some it's dangerous
But your mind and your heart's clogged with all your pain and
But a bond that we was holding, what made us famous
Hey miss, beautiful mami with tears of stone
Stop cryin', come talk to Tone
Tell me everything that's goin' wrong like your needs and doubts
My reason for coming in late, I need cheese and sprouts
So I could continue to hold down the foundation
It's pitiful how you could charge me with violations
Patience is the key, fuck the frustrations
We act off our emotions and we start hatin'
And that leads to stress, problems and weight loss
Total baldness, broke homes come from negative forces
Baby be cautious, you got to call the cops to get me out
When it come, babe, I'm goin' all out
It's T-O-N-E-Y, to Beyonce, my, sweetie pie
Please try, be mine til we die

[Hook 2X]

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
Beyonce.. beautiful girl
