[Verse 1: Bishop Lamont]
I like bush
No not the president
A tush, your tush, looks so Heaven sent
Heavenly body, you an Earth angel
I can see God in your booty from this angle
Hail Mary, full of grace
Please forgive me my Lord when she shake it in my face
Indian dance, I can make it rain
I'm part Navajo, nab a ho gotta go
Get her to my teepee, sip a drinky, feelin' freaky
Time to introduce you to my pee pee
Let's play House like Pee Wee
Get you screamin' like I said the secret word
Heavy breathin', heavin', hair clingin', claw scratchin', ass slappin'
Back twistin', tongue kissin', lip bite action
Bram Stroker, Smackula
I'm a bapper not a bap when I'm in back of ya

[Hook]
You go
Oh my God
When I'm hop out the Benz on them big boy rims, the girls be like
Oh my God
I can't even get it in, it's too big, it'll make you cry
Oh my God
Shorty got so much ass when she walk past it made me gasp
Oh my God
It's the brand new smash on Aftermath
Ohhhh ohhhhhh oh my God
When I see you walkin' by just stop
Cause you got my body hot (Hell yeah!)
Ohhhh ohhhhhh oh my God
If you tip it over, might get wet
In the room we're bound to sweat

[Verse 2: Bishop Lamont]
Pickup lines I ain't gots to say
I use four simple words, "I know Dr. Dre" (Hell yeah)
Star struck, get struck in the back of the truck
Bring your sexy ass friends, she's drunk as fuck
She says she loves Eminem, yes just my luck
Malibu, rendez-vous, she, me and you
Ocean view, Pay-Per-View, the Spice channel will do
Let's let nature take it's course and let it do what it do
It's the rap Lew Wasserman, cap blue, Dodger fan
Tattoo, sovereign, the west back, hot again
Best out the west, yes guess who they hollerin'?
Bishop Lamont, no church and got a followin'
Hold up
They gon' put me in the scripture
Cathedral, stain glass window, see my picture?
Sanctified, I got God on my side
Other side I got a fat ass strap tucked when I ride

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bishop Lamont]
Guns, drugs and T.V. dinners
Crips, Bloods, they all my niggas
Strip clubs? I love y'all sinners
I'm a sinner
To me we all winners
And don't be ashamed, God gave you a gift
So girl hit the pole and let your hip bone slip
You know what?
I love them church girls
Act so clean but they dirty girls
Readin' they Bibles, singin' choir songs
But get 'em all alone and motherfucker it's on
(Jeez!)
And them high school teachers is freaky too
Let me bend you across your desk, baby after school
Animalistic, sick, sadistic
Sex addicted, if it's pretty I might kiss it
I got money in the bank
With some fine ass twins that's what I call a double date

[Hook]
