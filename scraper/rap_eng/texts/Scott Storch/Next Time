[Chorus]
Oh I'm just lookin' for a guy
That's got some of a every little thing I want
Not try to play with my mind
I hope you do better next time
Oh I'm just lookin' for a guy
That's got some of a every little thing I want
Not try to play with my mind
I hope you do better next time

[Verse 1]
You thought I didn't hear about it
You thought that I wouldn't care
Why was I the last to know it
So now you're not playin' fair
She told me everytime you call her
How you give her your photograph
So now I'm just laughin' at ya
Cause one chick's gone
Can't have it back
Everybody knows the truth
The joke's on you
I'm lettin' go of everything we used to do
I don't even wanna think about it
Sittin' home alone
I doubt it
Gotta go
Pick up my phone
I'm not callin' you

[Chorus]
So please don't act surprised
Because I told ya so
I'm lookin' for a guy
Who can hang with me all night
Gotta know just what I like
Speeding off in a jag
And I'm gettin' butterflies
Hope ya do better next time
So why would I sit out on the side
Cause I'm movin' on with my life
Gotta find me a guy
Who can give me butterflies
Hope ya do better next time

[Verse 2]
It's funny how now you want me
I like how the tables turn
I used to be cryin' for ya
But I'm no longer concerned
So now we can both be honest
And I can finally be me
According to what I'm feelin'
I'm better off bein' free
Everybody knows the truth
The joke's on you
I'm lettin' go of everything we used to do
I don't even wanna think about it
Sittin' home alone
I doubt it
Gotta go
Pick up my phone
And I'm not callin' you

[Chorus]
So please don't act so nice
Because I told ya so
I'm lookin' for a guy
Who can hang with me all night
Gotta know just what I like
Speeding off in a jag
And I'm gettin' butterflies
Hope ya do better next time
Oh I'm just lookin' for a guy
That's got some of a every little thing I want
Not try to play with my mind
I hope you do better next time
I'm just lookin' for a guy
That's got some of a every little thing I want
Not try to play with my mind
I hope you do better next time

[Bridge]
Everybody knows the truth
The truth
The joke's on you
I'm letting go of everything we used to do
I don't even wanna talk about it
Sittin' home alone all alone
I doubt it
Gotta go
Pick up my phone
And I'm not callin' you

[Outro]
So please don't act surprised
Because I told ya for the last time
