[Intro: Juelz Santana]
Okay, check it, check it, check it out
It's Santana again stepping, stepping, stepping out
One of the brand new big boy toys
I do big boy things, I make big boy noise, 'cause
I know what girls want, I know what they like
They wanna stay up and party all night
So bring a friend!

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Let me talk to you, tell you how it is
I was thinking when I saw that body
Gotta get shawty, tell her what the young boy gon' do
Damn, them chicks with you gotta be your kin
Baby, pretty thick with the kick that's sick
That need to be hit, so tell me what y'all gon' do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I got friends and you got friends
They hop out, and you hop in
I look fly and they jocking
The way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop
I got friends and you got friends
They hop out, and you hop in
I look fly and they jocking
The way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Is ya man on the floor? If he ain't, lemme know
Let me see if you can run it, run it, girl indeed I can run it, run it
Is ya man on the floor? If he ain't, lemme know
Let me see if you can run it, run it, girl indeed I can run it, run it

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You'll see, girl I can set you off
Don't believe my age is gonna slow us down
I can definitely show you things to have you saying I can't be 16
Once I get in you won't wanna go
(And I) I'll have the girls wishing they were you
(And I) I know you heard about me
But guess what's going down if we leave

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I got friends and you got friends
They hop out, and you hop in
I look fly and they jocking
The way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop
I got friends and you got friends
They hop out, and you hop in
I look fly and they jocking
The way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Is ya man on the floor? If he ain't, lemme know
Let me see if you can run it, run it, girl indeed I can run it, run it
Is ya man on the floor? If he ain't, lemme know
Let me see if you can run it, run it, girl indeed I can run it, run it

[Bridge: Chris Brown (Juelz Santana)]
(Let's go!) Girl you feel right, feel right
Make me feel like, feel like
I wanna do a little something
Do a little something, ain't no thing let you do it for sure
Girl the way that you're wearing them jeans
Is turning me on
I'm the hottest thing that's in these streets
So baby won't you rock me? (DipSet, Santana)

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
Make it drop honey, make it pop honey
Whip whop, tick tock to the clock for me
Don't stop doing that and shawty
Know I mean what I say so she won't stop doing that
Plus I heard if you can dance you can bump
Well dance time is us, let's go, let's go, yup
We can get it in, we can gets some friends
Do it like the Ying Yang twins and start whispering
Wait 'til you see my (Ay!)
Wait 'til you see my (Ay!)
Let me fall back, you ain't ready for all that
Have you sleep late, real late, yeah taking a long nap
You tell your friends to get with my friends
We can be friends, switch and meet friends
(Switch!) We can do it all night long and...
'Til the clock hit morning, ya dig?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Is ya man on the floor? If he ain't, lemme know
Let me see if you can run it, run it, girl indeed I can run it, run it
Is ya man on the floor? If he ain't, lemme know
Let me see if you can run it, run it, girl indeed I can run it, run it
