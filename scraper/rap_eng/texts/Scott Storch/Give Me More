[Verse 1]
Never thought you'd be the one to play games the way you did
I gave my heart away to you
Never thought you'd leave the way you did
You meant the world to me
How could you just let me breath
Let me go away from you, let me be alone

[Chorus]
And you never lied to me baby
You said you'd always be around (be around)
Now i need more

[Post-Hook]
(Give me more)
Ooo what you do for me, Ooo what you do
(I want more)
Ooo what you do for me and Ooo what you do
(I need more)
Ooo what you do for me, Ooo what you do
(Give me more) Give it to me everyday
I need you in everyway

[Verse 2]
So don't stop the way you love me (the way you love me)
I don't want to look no more (I don't wanna look no more)
Take me in ur arms, understand I'm all for you
Untill the end of time (end of time), baby you'll be mine Oooo-ooo-ooo

[Chorus]

[Post-Hook]

[Bridge]
When did you fall when did it all just go away (go away)
When you said that we would never ever see the day (see the day)
I wouldn't want to be without you and your love (and your love)
I thought we'd always be together

[Chorus]

[Post-Hook]

[Outro]
La Di da
La di da daaa
La di daaa (Give me more)
Give it to me everyday
I need you in every way
