[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Standing over there
Watching me patiently
While I'm breaking a sweat
Dripping down my neck
Wrecklessly sexy and six inch heels I'm a threat
I was over there floating, my mind somewhere out in space
I was in my own world 'til I felt his arms around my waist
Eyes are always watching and I think it turns me on
You just need to sit back and watch me perform

[Chorus: Beyoncé Knowles, Kelly Rowland & Michelle Williams]
You like the way I twirk (twirk)
You wanna see me twirk daddy
You like the way I twirk it
You wanna see me twirk (twirk)
You like the way I twirk (twirk)
You wanna see me twirk with it
You like the way I twirk it
You wanna see me twirk

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
Dawn is creeping close
Breathing so heavy, watching my silhouette glow (I know you're watching me)
Putting on a show
No intermission, explicitly sexual (don't try to stop me)
I know you're watchin' me, I feel your eyes on top of me
My neck, my back, you clockin' me
You wishing that it belong to you
I can feel how much you want me
And it really turns me on
You just sit back, relax and watch me perform

[Chorus: Beyoncé Knowles, Kelly Rowland & Michelle Williams]
You like the way I twirk (twirk)
You wanna see me twirk daddy
You like the way I twirk it
You wanna see me twirk (twirk)
You like the way I twirk (twirk)
You wanna see me twirk with it
You like the way I twirk it
You wanna see me twirk

[Verse 3: Michelle Williams]
He likes the way
I dip with my hips
The way I write on my lips
When I turn and I twist
I know he likes the way
I look back and stare
Throw my hand in the air
Like I don't even care

[Chorus: Beyoncé Knowles, Kelly Rowland & Michelle Williams]
You like the way I twirk (twirk)
You wanna see me twirk daddy
You like the way I twirk it
You wanna see me twirk (twirk)
You like the way I twirk (twirk)
You wanna see me twirk with it
You like the way I twirk it
You wanna see me twirk
