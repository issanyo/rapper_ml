[ Chorus ]
I been hanging out with the koolkidz
Knowing my bestfriend crazy as fuck
Knowing that she has my back
They ain’t even know I’m coming back on the tracks
Middle fingers up to the fakes
Knowing y’all was just a bunch of mistakes
Wondering around in school
Knowing that your talking shit about me
But can’t even say it to my face

[ Verse 1 ]
Nanoo
Walking around in the hallway
Y’all keep on looking at me
Can’t even say to my face
I know y’all trying to keep up with the pace
Rumor that they talk about me is just the hate
Can't even say a few words with a little fate
I’m always dealing with this sacrifice
Telling someone to pull up to your fight
Believing in me knowing I’m right
When I come to the booth
Knowing Ima spit the truth
I don’t make up theses lies
Telling someone that they can be my ride or die
Feeling like a koolkid
But they can’t say to my face

[ Chorus ]
I been hanging out with the koolkidz
Knowing my bestfriend crazy as fuck
Knowing that she has my back
They ain’t even know I’m coming back on the tracks
Middle fingers up to the fakes
Knowing y’all was just a bunch of mistakes
Wondering around in school
Knowing that your talking shit about me
But can’t even say it to my face
