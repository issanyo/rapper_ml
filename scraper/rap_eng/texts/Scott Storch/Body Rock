Verse 1:
Dim the lights down low
Take your time with me
But I don't need deep or slow
Lay back and let your hands find
Every secret spot of mine
Calling me
Let the candles blow
While I'm rocking your body
From head to toe
You can watch my silhouette flow
On the wall it can be your
Private picture show

Chorus:
Body rock, put it all on me
Body rock, spread it all over
Body rock rock rock, give it all to me
Body rock, baby bring it home
Body rock, put it all on me
Body rock, don't hold back on me boy
Body rock rock rock, don't leave me hungry
Body rock, baby bring it home

Verse 2:
Baby, hold me close
'Cause I wanna feel your every move for sure
And the experience
Back to back, back to back, back to back
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Til I can't take no more
6, then we move to the floor
7, 8, 9, 10, oh

Chorus:
Body rock, put it all on me
Body rock, spread it all over
Body rock rock rock, give it all to me
Body rock, baby bring it home
Body rock, put it all on me
Body rock, don't hold back on me no
Body rock rock rock, don't leave me hungry
Body rock, baby bring it home

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
