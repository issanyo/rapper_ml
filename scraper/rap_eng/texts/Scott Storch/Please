[Verse 1]
I know you watching
All over here
Tryna find a way to
Come into my situation
But you should know this

Tell ya girl I don't care to fight

So you should know better than
To think that you could ever put it down like I can

If he needs good lovin' (I got it)
If I need to heat it up (I got fire)
Make sure I'm the best (for him) for (sure)
He's running home to me for it
And he knows whatever he wants (that I'm with it)
And he knows the perfect place (to come get it)
And he knows that every woman is in me

You're in violation, let me help you understand
Before we have a problem

When it comes to my man
Please don't let me solve one

And every day's an anniversary
You should think about the time you waste
'Cause my last name ain't gon' change
