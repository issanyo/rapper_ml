[Intro:]
Hahahaha, yeah, that's right
Uh-huh, yeah
So destructive, yeah

[Hook: Trials]
I take you to the bottleshop (yeah!)
We 'bout to rack all you got (that's right!)
I drink until I'm nodding off (bitch!)
Keep going until you knock the lot (woah!)
I take you to the bottleshop (let's go!)
We 'bout to rack all you got (all you got!)
I drink until I'm nodding off (fuck it!)
Keep going until you knock the lot (woah!)

[Verse 1: Trials]
I've been drinking all day, bro, 'bout to vomit
Can I borrow a 50, or should I hit up Honson
Drunk driving? okay, let's go to the next stop
Mouth raw, trying to sell rock-tops and twist-offs
I broke it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a wine-o, I be a wine-o
In the hotel I pulled over by 5 o
Pissed in the story kitchen passed on a line-o
Got the magic drink, I'm the smart doctor
Had the friends scared that just how drunk I got ya
Drive to the drive-in, drop, no license
Put it on a case when I take no fathers
I'm a season vet when it's skipping a check
After we drink the rest hit the [?]
See, I'm trying to explain bro, the best while I can
Take a swig at the bottle, then you passed it at ten

[Hook: Trials]
I take you to the bottleshop (yeah!)
We 'bout to rack all you got (that's right!)
I drink until I'm nodding off (bitch!)
Keep going until you knock the lot (woah!)
I take you to the bottleshop (let's go!)
We 'bout to rack all you got (all you got!)
I drink until I'm nodding off (fuck it!)
Keep going until you knock the lot (woah!)

[Pre-Verse: Trials]
What we drink (what we drink)
And where we drink (and where we drink)
The things we drink (the things we drink)
[?] have to get up quick and spit in the sink

[Verse 2: Trials]
Hey, pour it in a shot glass nice and slow
Bit of [?] in the cup, JÃ¤ger set to go
You ain't never heard me slur like this before
'Cause I ain't never drunk shit like this
Soon as I come through the door, get you hitting up the liquor
It's like a race, see who can dack more quicker
Hitting up the tonic [?] 'til it's gone
Got another girl on her back, 'bout to do a body shot
Touch the right spot at the wrong time
Mics on and mics off, too drunk to rhyme
So destructive, call up a bitch for bad time
See the world on slo-mo, drunk off the red wine
Long as she ain't stopping, I ain't stopping
Dripping wet with [?] hoodie soaked off
And I'ma stand straight campaign, bottle after bottle of Son
Gonna drink 'til we drunk or every bottle is gone

[Hook: Trials]
I take you to the bottleshop (yeah!)
We 'bout to rack all you got (that's right!)
I drink until I'm nodding off (bitch!)
Keep going until you knock the lot (woah!)
I take you to the bottleshop (let's go!)
We 'bout to rack all you got (all you got!)
I drink until I'm nodding off (fuck it!)
Keep going until you knock the lot (woah!)
