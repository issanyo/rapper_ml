I was your Fresh Prince back in the summer days
I loved you Nia Long time, yeah
You had them Daisy Dukes that start below the waist
Showing off your bikini line

And I know, that you, you got a thing for the young boy
And I know, that you, mess with dudes in them fast cars, oh

Sunshine is falling, your body is calling
Them panties is coming off
Let's put on some 12 play, go half on a baby
Why don't we fall in love?
Like we did in the 90s, like we did in the 90s
When TLC wasn't Too Proud to Beg, and remember Keith made you Sweat?
Back when Jodeci sang Forever My Lady, you'll be my baby
Like the 90s, like we did in the 90s, 90s

On the B-Ball court watching homies play
You already know that I'm rocking a fresh pair, Jay's
Bamboo earrings and high top fades
Is what comes to mind when I think about the way
That you've got me

And I know, that you, you got a thing for the bad boys
And I know, that you, mess with dudes in them fast cars, oh

Sunshine is falling, your body is calling
Them panties is coming off
Let's put on some 12 play, go half on a baby
Why don't we fall in love?
Like we did in the 90s, like we did in the 90s
When TLC wasn't Too Proud to Beg, and remember Keith made you Sweat?
Back when Jodeci sang Forever My Lady, you'll be my baby
Like the 90s, like we did in the 90s, 90s


Feeling you just because, give me that 90s love
Kissing, feeling on your butt
Baby you got more than love
Feeling you just because, give me that 90s love
Kissing, feeling on your butt
Baby you got more than love

And I know, that you, you got a thing for the bad boys
And I know, that you, mess with dudes in them fast cars
Like we did in the 90s, like we did in the 90s
When TLC wasn't Too Proud to Beg, and remember Keith made you Sweat?
Back when Jodeci sang Forever My Lady, you'll be my baby
Like the 90s, like we did in the 90s, 90s
Oh yeah, yeah
