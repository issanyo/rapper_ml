[Verse 1]
There ya go
On your own
Standin' up against the wall
I hear the music callin' you
It's callin' me
Don't think that we should stall
It's in your eyes
I can see
You want to ask
But you don't have the nerve
Here's my invitin' accept
I know ya got the urge

[Chorus]
No need in leavin' early
You found somebody to move with
Ain't no need of lookin' around
I'm standin' in front of your face
Don't try to fight the feelin'
We've got to live in the moment
I'm ready whenever you say so
You don't have to dance alone
Not here
My arms are open wide
I'm here for you
So take my hand
Don't dance alone
This song was made for us
And don't hesitate to come and meet me

[Verse 2]
There ya go
Sittin' down
Tryin' to keep ya cool
But you hear the rhythm callin' you
It's callin' me
You ain't got nothin' to lose
A spotlight's shinin' on us both
The time is now
You got a life to live
Don't let this moment pass us by
Live tonight
We got a show to give

[Chorus]
No need in leavin' early
You found somebody to move with
Ain't no need of lookin' around
I'm standin' in front of your face
Don't try to fight the feelin'
We've got to live in the moment
I'm ready whenever you say so
You don't have to dance alone
Not here
My arms are open wide
I'm here for you
So take my hand
Don't dance alone
This song was made for us
And don't hesitate to come and meet me

[Spanish Rap]

[Bridge]
She wanna go all the places I be
She wanna roll with noxy
Mama
Tequila ma
See them lights is strobbin'
Nox and Brooke Hogan
Clemente style
The bass is stolen
Mama
Let's get it goin'

[Chorus]
You don't have to dance alone
Not here
My arms are open wide
I'm here for you
So take my hand
Don't dance alone
This song was made for us
And don't hesitate to come and meet me
