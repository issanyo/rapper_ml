[Verse 1]
I was lonely, only I didn't know it
I was so sad, only I didn't show it

[Refrain]
You came like the sun breaking through the clouds
And I found you're what I couldn't live without

[Chorus]
With you, I feel the other half of my heartbeat, I'm complete
In you, I hear the other half of my heartbeat, that's all I need
And no, I didn't know what I was missing
Oh, but baby, since we've been kissing
Oh, I can feel the other half of my heartbeat
It's so sweet lying here with you

[Verse 2]
You look at me and I see my reflection
You understand who I am, needs protection
The way you rush to me
The way you take my hand
And I follow you to fall down in the sand

[Chorus]
With you, I feel the other half of my heartbeat, I'm complete
In you, I hear the other half of my heartbeat, that's all I need
And no, I didn't know what I was missing
Oh, but baby, since we've been kissing
Oh, I can feel the other half of my heartbeat
It's so sweet lying here with you

[Interlude (Spoken)]
My heart beats like a drum when I hear you come

[Refrain]
You came like the sun breaking through the clouds
And I found you're what I couldn't live without

[Chorus]
With you, I feel the other half of my heartbeat, I'm complete
In you, I hear the other half of my heartbeat, that's all I need
And no, I didn't know what I was missing
Oh, but baby, since we've been kissing
Oh, I can feel the other half of my heartbeat
It's so sweet, lying here with you
