[Intro]
Hard to miss you when you walk in the room
Girl you shining bright like a light
First move and it's all on me
And I gotta get it right
Scott Storch

[Verse 1]
I'm runnin' out of time (Runnin')
Took a chance and rolled the dice (Yeah)
Are you gonna play your role like Pippen?
Or MJ and take flight? (Take flight, take flight)
I can't let you get away (Yeah, yeah)
She playin' tag, she like the chase
And you know a real nigga set the pace
I'm a king but you can be my ace

[Pre-Chorus]
All this liquor girl it got me lovin' you
Wish you could see things from my point of view
I'm outta my mind (Outta my)
I'm goin' outta my mind (I'm goin' outta my mind)
Girl I can't leave you behind (Girl I can't leave you behind)
No I can't leave it behind (No I can't leave it behind)

[Chorus]
High heels with the bright red dress on
Are you ready for the night?
Hard to miss you when you walk in the room
Girl you shining bright like a light (Li-li-li-li-light)
First move and it's all on me
And I gotta get it right (Gotta-gotta get it right)
I love the way that she dance on me
Yeah that body feelin' right

[Verse 2]
Sweet lips, nice thighs, bright eyes
She my type, I just need her for the night
Hit it in the uber, that's a ride
Bad boy but I slide in so polite
Perfume in the air, I could smell the vibe
Look into your eyes, I wanna get inside
I hate it when you make me beg
But girl you're so 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]
All this liquor girl it got me lovin' you
Wish you could see things from my point of view
I'm outta my mind (Outta my)
I'm goin' outta my mind (I'm goin' outta my mind)
Girl I can't leave you behind (Girl I can't leave you behind)
No I can't leave it behind (No I can't leave it behind)

[Chorus]
High heels with the bright red dress on
Are you ready for the night
Hard to miss you when you walk in the room
Girl you shining bright like a light (Li-li-li-li-light)
First move and it's all on me
And I gotta get it right (Gotta-gotta get it right)
I love the way that she dance on me
Yeah that body feelin' right

[Outro]
One night
Are you ready for the night?
Are you ready for the night?
Are you ready for the-
