[Chorus]
I come back to life
They tryna kill me with their words
But that ain't gonna work, no
I come back to life
Somebody let them know
They might have gotten close but
I come back to life, yeah
I come back to life, yeah

[Verse 1]
They tryna to kill me but they can't do it
I bounce back
To get through it I go through it
No losing, just learning
I'm in Sherman Oaks
I just got back from the German coast
Middle eastern women love me
Put me on a Persian throne
Some people angry they believe I'm too proud
Out here I lose all talk and the arenas too loud
Got a target on my back
That's what's different boy
That's what confidence in tracks
That's what winning does

[Pre-Chorus]
Pick myself up, watch them all start tweaking
I may not respond but I see y'all sneaking
I ain't for retweets
I see y'all reaching
Damn that's your girl
She'll be here all weekend
Pick myself up, watch them all start tweaking
I may not respond but I see y'all sneaking
I ain't for retweets
I see y'all reaching
Damn that's your girl
She'll be here all weekend

[Chorus]
I come back to life
They tryna kill me with their words
But that ain't gonna work, no
I come back to life
Somebody let them know
They might have gotten close but
I come back to life, yeah
I come back to life, yeah

[Verse 2]
They want me to kill myself
But the only thing suicidal
Is the doors of my McLaren
I'm winning, you in denial
My rival is my reflection
While I pursue perfection
I'm using your negativity
Channeling my aggression
Into hits, plaques, shows, they happened
Grateful that I don't get lost in hoes and fashion
This is the bounce back soundtrack
Used to work at Outback
I found rap
What would I be without that?

[Pre-Chorus]
Pick myself up, watch them all start tweaking
I may not respond but I see y'all sneaking
I ain't for retweets
I see y'all reaching
Damn that's your girl
She'll be here all weekend
Pick myself up, watch them all start tweaking
I may not respond but I see y'all sneaking
I ain't for retweets
I see y'all reaching
Damn that's your girl
She'll be here all weekend

[Chorus]
I come back to life
They tryna kill me with their words
But that ain't gonna work, no
I come back to life
Somebody let them know
They might have gotten close but
I come back to life, yeah
I come back to life, yeah
