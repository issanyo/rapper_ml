[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, huh
Yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one, pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah bitch I'm drastic
Some of y'all ain't writing well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't Giselle, cat walk and imagine
A lot of y'all Hollywood, drama, casted
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

Pre-chorus]
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind

[Chorus]
Now let me blow ya mind
Now let me drop your glasses
Now let me pacify
I feel the speed is rockin' inside your spine
Now let me blow ya mind
Now let me drop your glasses
Now let me pacify
I feel the speed is rockin' inside your spine

[Verse 2]
Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, sixteens mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressing, chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishing I wrote your rhymes

Pre-chorus]
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind

[Chorus]
Now let me blow ya mind
Now let me drop your glasses
Now let me pacify
I feel the speed is rockin' inside your spine
Now let me blow ya mind
Now let me drop your glasses
Now let me pacify
I feel the speed is rockin' inside your spine
