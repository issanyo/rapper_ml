[Intro]
I love that shit
I love that shit
I love that shit

[Verse 1: Bun B]
It's going down like it always do
I'm about to hit them, front door, front row with the crew
I pull up to valet in the '09 Cedes
And turn the heads of all the fly ladies
I lift the doors out, then lift the doors up
Step out the car and the whole world slows up
I show up like a certified pro
Looking like slow motion when I heads to the door
I walk right past the line to the rope
Everybody fall back like I'm the motherfuckin po'
And it's not even a question if I finna bring the strap in
They tried to pat me down but it ain't finna happen
Head to the bar, all eyes on B-da
From the haters and the fly mamacitas
And trust me man when the club this thick
You ain't even got to ask
I luv this shit

[Chorus: Bun B (Unknown Female Voice)]
The club is packed, the bottles is popping
We make it rain when the models is bopping, mayne (I luv that shit)
Ladies shaking they backs
And all the players and the pimps is catching heart attacks, come on (I luv that shit)
Ayyo DJ turn it up (I luv that shit)
You got a beat, then let's burn it up {burn it up}
You know we do it B-I-G
So come and holla at a player in the V-I-P

[Verse 2: Bun B]
UGK we in the house fo'sho
We about to crank this thing up and you already know
We in the club looking like new money
Put ya stunna shades on 'cause the ice too sunny
Me and my partners posted up at the bar
And we about to buy it out, for the price of your car
All the Ace of Spades, all the Rozay
All the syrup and white and Patron, okay?
They sending out ice buckets by the dozens
I pass 'em out to my dogs and my cousins
The whole club full of smoke and we buzzing
It's going down in here man, you thought it wasn't?
Moving through the club like a conga line
See the baddest little bopper, legs long and fine
And she like "I love your ropes, are they solid gold or hollow B?"
I'll tell ya in the VIP, mami
Follow me


[Chorus]


[Verse 3 - Bun B]
Ain't no party like a trill ass party, 'cause a trill ass party don't stop
Mayne it ain't no shorty like a trill ass shorty, 'cause a trill ass shorty gon' drop
Go on drop it down low to the floor, make it pop
I want to watch you wobble, show me what you got
Now go on work that, and twerk that
Now wiggle it around baby jerk that
Now toot it up, and boot it up
I'm cocked and loaded and imma shoot it up
Now grind it, dirty wind it
Now back it up, while I get behind it
Now go ahead and do your thang girl
Let it loose, let it go, let it hang girl
And shake what your momma gave ya for daddy
And maybe you can ride shotgun in the Caddy, come on

[Chorus] 2x
