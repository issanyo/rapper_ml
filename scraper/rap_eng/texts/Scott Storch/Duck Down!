[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yeah
We gettin' ready to break y'all, it's winner take all
The game is locked we down to the eight ball
The time is now, it ain't nothin' to wait for
I'm a king by blood, a soldier by nature
I'm somethin' like a threat to y'all space cadets
Cause you never met a brother nothin' like me yet
So push another slice into your toaster, tighten your vests
Cuz it's a warrior you seein' here tonight in the flesh
I give you somethin' high voltage, double the dosage
Runnin' with these vultures, givin' me ulcers
Which one of these hustlers bringin' the thunder?
'Riq Geez not another man takin' us under
Nigga please which Philly cat doin' his own thing
Might say Black my give you a code name
Round my neck see the microphone hang
Have your lady lip-synchin' like on Soul Train
The niggas that's a problem's a  minimal margin
The Colonel, Captain, Lieutenant, General, Sergeant
Black, one man army movin' in on your squadron
You sittin' still you know you a target
You heard, you better duck down!

[Hook: repeat 2X]
See me comin' better tuck those chains
Cuz you don't wanna feel them thangs
If you want it, you can get it baby
You know you need to get low
Duck Down! (Duck Down!)

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yeah
We gettin' set to get rid of y'all, that's what it's headin' for
The underdog knuckle and brawl with the bigger ball
I spit what your wig absorb, sicker than sycamore
I'm creatin' a circumstance that you a victim of
The rebel or the renegade out on the quest
The super black man runnin' wit a S on his chest
That stand for the straight struggle to escape the stress
You think it's sweet tryin' to eat, you ain't taste this yet
So make y'all steps precautious into the darkness
Thoughts cold and heartless makin' me nauseous
Gettin' more remorseless for what I done
If the lawyers and courts wonder what I run
Them civil liberties is free, but just for some
How you a gangster when you scared to bust your gun
For the call, trust your fam or trust nobody at all
See them brothers gettin' struck down
They better duck down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Yeah
I can feel somethin' fa sho, I've been up in here before
The gladiator in a Colosseum ready for war
That old timer holdin' his revolver set to blow
Just like a gladiator at whoever stick his head in the door
And one who been through it all, anything go
Rather give it to you straight 'stead of speakin in codes
Cuz man, that bullshit can get you riddled with holes
If you ain't insured then the hospitals is closed
You got to go uptown while ya leakin' on the ground
In cases like these, you need to duck down
You're five dollar toys, I'm a million dollar man
Esquire 'Riq Geez go according to plan
I'm thinkin' outside the box, off the blocks
An outside your concept of time, off the clocks for real
Well it's Black Thought your boss DJ
However you brothers weigh that's what you gon' pay

[Hook] - 2X
