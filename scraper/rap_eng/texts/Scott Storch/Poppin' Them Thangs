[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Every hood we go through
All the gangsters around know my whole crew
We hold it down like we 'sposed to
Nigga you can front if you want, we be poppin' them thangs
Every hood we go through
All the gangsters around know my whole crew
We hold it down like we 'sposed to
Nigga you can front if you want, we be poppin' them thangs

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
After the VMA's my baby momma cussed my ass out
I kicked her ass, we back friends like Puffy and Steve Stoute
Cut the grass around my clique so I could see these snakes
You see 'em back in the hood, it's cause I see they're fake
I preach a sermon 'bout the paper like I'm Creflo Dollar
I pop you punk niggas like I pop my collar
I'm confused, I like Megan, Monica and Mya
Missy's freaky and Brandy's shy, oh
Now take a look at how my lifestyle changed up
I'm on now, God damnit, I done came up
Now you can find me with the finest hoes
Choosin' which whip to drive by what match my clothes
I got a fetish for the stones, I'm heavy on the ice man
If I ain't got a pistol on me, sure I got a knife fam
Get out of line and I'm lightin' yo' ass up
Semi-automatic's spray I tighten yo' ass up - what?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Every hood we go through
All the gangsters around know my whole crew
We hold it down like we 'sposed to
Nigga you can front if you want, we be poppin' them thangs
Every hood we go through
All the gangsters around know my whole crew
We hold it down like we 'sposed to
Nigga you can front if you want, we be poppin' them thangs

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Slow down little nigga, don't exceed your speed
Cause I will put G's on your fitted like the Negro League
I got connects, I don't need no weed
I been in L.A. for a year now, so I don't see no seeds
After I'm done you: clappin' the crew
Hell yeah I fuck fans, guess what, your favorite rapper does too
In a minute I'ma have the jeweler makin' my rims spin
My crew run wild like the Jamaicans in Kingston
Nuttin' but bling bling in your face boy; that's why my neck
Shine like one of the shirts that Puffy and Mase wore
I done found a nympho as soon as I pop a bra
She at my balls, head first like a soccer star
You can only stand next to the man if you proper
I take care of birds like an animal doctor
I been out and buzzin', niggas just slept on me
So I'm out for revenge like one of Bin Laden cousins

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Every hood we go through
All the gangsters around know my whole crew
We hold it down like we 'sposed to
Nigga you can front if you want, we be poppin' them thangs
Every hood we go through
All the gangsters around know my whole crew
We hold it down like we 'sposed to
Nigga you can front if you want, we be poppin' them thangs

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Read the paper, look at the news, we on the front page
Yeah we in the Bahamas with AK's on the stage
The ice in the Jacob watch'll make a broke nigga take somethin'
So I gotta keep the fo'-fifth with no safety button
G-Unit get that money, I know some artists is starvin'
But play the game like they rich, to me the shit funny
I know you see me comin'; cause on the front of the Maybach
It say payback for those that hated on me
I hate when niggas claim they bangin' a gang
You ain't a Crip like Snoop, you ain't a Blood like Game
See I been havin' beef, I got my own bulletproof vest
Most of my enemies dead, I got about two left
Until my last breath, I'm sendin' niggas bullet holes
Innocent bystanders get hit tryin' to be heroes
You know how we roll, everywhere that we go
It's Fo-Fo's, Calicos, and Desert Eagles, yeah

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Every hood we go through
All the gangsters around know my whole crew
We hold it down like we 'sposed to
Nigga you can front if you want, we be poppin' them thangs
Every hood we go through
All the gangsters around know my whole crew
We hold it down like we 'sposed to
Nigga you can front if you want, we be poppin' them thangs
