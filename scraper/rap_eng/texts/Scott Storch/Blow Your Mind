[Hook]
You better not be the one to doubt us
'Cuz we been putting in them hours
We only taking what was ours
So you better not be the one to doubt us
'Cuz we gon' blow your mind
We gon' blow your mind
We gon' blow your mind

[Verse 1]
Okay okay whoa whoa whoa
We been we been on the road road road road road
From the go in my glow glow glow
We been down for too long to give up, can't go
I need all pesos, want it all, case closed
I go balls to the wall 'till the wall can't hold
'Till the ballgame over, these boys can't hold me
You boys can't hold us, I told ya

[Hook]
You better not be the one to doubt us
'Cuz we been putting in them hours
We only taking what was ours
So you better not be the one to doubt us
'Cuz we gon' blow your mind

[Verse 2]
When I was back home, washing them dishes
I was just wishin', I could just vision, I was gon' get it
I was on missions, I was just livin'
Walked in that building we was just building
Takin' our time, we was just [?], we was just children
'Way from these haters, know they be watching like a theatre
Plotting these niggas that we need later
They gon' be greatest, [?]
This is what made us, we are omega probably roll later
Probably just, probably just err, probably just leave
I see you later, hasta luega, cop a new crib
Got some new niggas, you get this big
They gon' want favors, they gon' want flavors
Probably roll paper
Hope the lord save us, 'way from these haters hope the lord save us
'Way from these snakes, 'way from these fakes, wait I need breaks
Wait I need cake, how long can we wait
Come on for Pete's sake

[Hook]
You better not be the one to doubt us
'Cuz we been putting in them hours
We only taking what was ours
So you better not be the one to doubt us
'Cuz we gon' blow your mind
We gon' blow your mind
We gon' blow your mind
We gon' blow your mind
We gon' blow your mind
