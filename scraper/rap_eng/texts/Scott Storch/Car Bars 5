Sup, motherfuckers, it's the kid Merkules, car bars volume five
I think, I can't count, with that being said this is over another classic instrumental, this one being by xzibit, shout out to the big homie xzibit, I'm sweating like a fuckin' hooker in church right now, so let's make this happen, Stealthbomb Records, Stopmdown Killaz, 100MAD for life, share this on your facebook page if love me, I know you know this track
Yo, the microphone controller, not the type to hold composure, got weed inside my jeans, so you might just smell an odor, I'm comin' to kill 'em for claimin' that they ain't heard of us
They talkin' that flicks when I say don't me a murderer, came to spray the place with a burner and leave your shirt with blood
Gonna scrape your face of the pavement, just like a surgeon does
Word up, I'm so astrud up, your shorty looking like Ursula, you give your album for free 'cause nobody purchase 'em
I hold one on my shoulder, try to expose the scum, when you at home all alone plannin' to vote for trump
Now I guess I'm a rolemodel to kids, you can get your head splitted with a whole bottle of whiskey
Don't bother to diss me, you no Pac or no Biggie, I'll break your fuckin' heads like a boat off to play frisbee, I'm showin' 'em all, I bet I am the best you heard off, I'm so raw that every line doin' time for attempted murder
I smoke a blunt while I'm watchin' The Walking Dead and in my shed I keep Rusty Osage to cut off their heads
My shit made Busta Rhymes wanna chop off all his dreads, I'm sicker than dead bodies in coffins, I'm off my meds
I leave 'em drownin' in a flood, that's a deadpool, I used to draw pictures of people dying while at school
I bully bullies and get answers to my tests too, a monster.. the doctor got pissin' in a test-tube
Yo, they lookin' like some fries to me, I ain't sayin' that I'm hungry but I can eat
Fuckin' throw the ketchup and please pass the salt, I'm on a diet but I'm hungry and I'm havin' withdrawals, these kids are soft, I'm dippin' 'em in chicken sauce
Stab 'em in their chest, now they on the stick like a shish kebab
Don't get wrong, I'm the illest spitter since Biggie gone, but me and all these rappers.. we don't get along
It's Merk
You know what it is, peace
