[Intro]
Ah, yeah
That's hot
Ah, yeah
Scott Storch
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Gonna make me scream
Wanna cause a riot
Make a lot of noise
I don't wanna be quiet
When it gets real loud, make it even louder
Gotta turn me on
Gotta make me holla

[Chorus]
You gotta know what to do if you wanna get down
So don't go off too smooth
Now you're running out of time
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

[Verse 2]
Can you make me hot?
Make me touch the ceiling
Can you read my mind?
Can you gimme that feeling?
When I lose my clothes
You like that, don't cha?
Let's get exposed
'Cause you know you want to

[Chorus]
You gotta know what to do if you wanna get down
So don't go off too smooth
Now you're running out of time
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

[Interlude]
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!)
Don't play around
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!)
Let's get it started now

[Bridge]
You can get it started
Don't be scared to party
Get up, move your body
It's time to party

[Chorus]
You gotta know what to do if you wanna get down
So don't go off too smooth
Now you're running out of time
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

[Outro]
Oh, don't be afraid to turn it up
Oh, don't be afraid to turn it up
