[Chorus]
Big bags, big bags
Yeah we smokin' out the big bags, big bags
Yeah we pullin’ out the, big bags, big bags
I’m on one, I might snatch yo bitch!
Drug money make the girls go wild (drug money, drug money)
It make the girls go wild
Drug money make the girls go wild (drug money, drug money)
It make the girls go

[Verse 1]
Big bags  (chunky bags), big checks (big checks)
And my bookie like the way I’m bettin’ on shit
'Cause I dropped a 100 on the gang
I been all around the world, all the dope boys know my name
Bern, yeah I started on the curb
I push big herb, do dumb shit, and never learn (never learn)
Hard-headed, but I eat well
Wake up and get the Maybach detailed
I woke up, next to three or four females
I’m on in the game, it all started with a weed sale
Yeah, I'm from San Fran Sander
The home of cookie, and my bags much better
I got

[Chorus]
Big bags, big bags
Yeah we smokin' out the big bags, big bags
Yeah we pullin’ out the, big bags, big bags

Drug money make the girls go wild (drug money, drug money)

Drug money make the girls go wild (drug money, drug money)
It make the girls go
Big bags, big bags
Yeah we smokin' out the big bags, big bags
Yeah we pullin’ out the, big bags, big bags

Drug money make the girls go wild (drug money, drug money)

[Verse 2]
Big bags (big bags), big checks (big checks)
Dope boy fresh, bitch I’m hood rich (street rich)
I just pulled a Lamborghini off the lot (the lambo)
They line up for the weed every time we drop (legends)
Hit the cherry with the lemon (with the lemon)
Trapstar, my phone ring 24/7 (all day)
I got ice, wax sauce and some fresh live resin
I’m a roll one, yeah I might be stuck for a second (real stoner)
When the cops pulled me over, I had three packs on me
And a fresh cracked corona (it’s cold)
Game over, yeah I’m about to take over
On my way to the spot and every time that I cop
I grab

[Chorus]
Big bags, big bags
Yeah we smokin' out the big bags, big bags
Yeah we pullin’ out the, big bags, big bags
I’m on one, I might snatch yo bitch!
Drug money make the girls go wild (drug money, drug money)
It make the girls go wild
Drug money make the girls go wild (drug money, drug money)
It make the girls go
Big bags, big bags
Yeah we smokin' out the big bags, big bags
Yeah we pullin’ out the, big bags, big bags
I’m on one, I might snatch yo bitch!
Drug money make the girls go wild (drug money, drug money)
It make the girls go wild
Drug money make the girls go wild (drug money, drug money)
It make the girls go
