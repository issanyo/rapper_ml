[Verse 1 - Game]
I'm in the club with the sawed off, some niggas can pop off
See niggas get shot down and niggas get hauled off
The club get closed down, the scene get rolled off
See niggas they know now, the word around town
My team is not soft, my team gon' pop off
The beams is locked on, your hat get knocked off
So homie back down 'fore niggas get clapped down
'Cause this is the last call and it's 'bout to go down
The club is packed up, the bar is backed up
The bitches is drunk and all my niggas strapped up
See you niggas act up and you niggas wrapped up
Your bitch got a loud mouth, your bitch get smacked up
See this is the jump off and niggas is not safe
You come into my town, you're fuckin' with Doc Dre
You walkin' on my turf and it's 'bout to go down

[Hook - Ja Rule]
I'll be damned if I do, damned if I don't
Jump off, jump off
What you hoes want?
Cash, dro, '64, Westcoast
Bitch, you know we get psycho, psycho
We in the club with the lights off
Lookin' for bitches that want to jump off
And any niggas feelin' they wanna gun talk
Jump off, jump off

[Verse 2 - Game]
Somebody go tell the DJ that this is the jump off
And I'm on the dance floor, I'm ready to pop off
See niggas get too close and niggas get fucked up
The rest get stomped out for steppin' on my Chucks
Security back up before you get wrapped up
And then you get beat down 'cause you tryna act tough
My team gon' pop off, my team is not soft
The chronic get smoked up and this is the jump off
And it's 'bout to go down, see you niggas know now
The bitches is dressed up, they ready to crush now
My niggas is iced out, them niggas is real Crips
They fuckin' with real Bloods and we on some real shit
'Cause my niggas pop guns and you niggas pop corks
Come into my world, you're fuckin' with Scott Storch
You walkin' on my turf and it's 'bout to go down

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Game]
Yeah, you niggas know now that it's 'bout to go down
The club is packed up, the word around town
That this is the jump off, you know when the shit drop that this is the jump off
I did it for Big Pop, I'm pourin' my Chris out
Them bitches is too hot, they takin' they clothes off
They yellin' out 2Pac 'cause I'm from the Westside and they from the Eastcoast
My niggas from down South they lettin' they teeth show
'Cause this ain't Def Jam and this ain't Bad Boy
This ain't Star Trak, this is the last call
They turnin' the lights on, the bar is shut down
I'm walkin' with Doc Dre and we in the front now
The bitches is with me they ready to pop off
You bringin' your girlfriend, she gotta get knocked off
So hop in the '64 'cause it's 'bout to go down

[Hook]
