[Verse 1]
Child in my womb, love fills this room
Tranquility surrounding me
Feels so good to love you so already precious to my soul yeah
Let me be your eyes, I'll show you what I, I see
Staring out my window sill
Piercing through the breeze I hear
A child’s name is used in vain
Being shouted to shame
About something, was he to blame?
Or a victim of a circumstance in which he doesn’t understand?
His mama’s mad, his daddy’s glad, cause now she’s not up to ask
Why last night he stayed out late
And karma we stay

[Chorus]
Hear me, see me
Know all i can show you
Trust me, i know i’ll find a way
(love will find a way)
Hear me
See see me
Know all i can show you
Trust me, i know i’ll find a way, yeah

[Verse 2]
Peace be still, it once was said
A wise man once owned thoughts blown out his head
Prostitution runs this land, on this country we stand
Being hoed out to the man
Caravan being led to the clan
This love is true
My gift to you - oooh
A tool to use in all you do, uh huh
Over and over the cycles we weave
What is it that we all see?
What do we believe?
Trapped inside our minds
Evil is conceived while we’re waitin to be freed
I see beggars begging, widows crying, schemers (lyin)
Children dying
What’s goin on today?

[Chorus]
Hear me
See me
Know all i can show you
Trust me, i know i’ll find a way
(love will find a way)
Hear me
See see me
Know all i can show you
Trust me, i know i’ll find a way, yeah

Hear me
See see me
Know all i can show you, uh huh
I know i know i know (trust me, i know i’ll find a way)
Hear me
See see me
Know all i can show you, uh huh
I know i know i know (trust me, i know i’ll find a way)

[Outro]
Whenever they say (hear me)
You make me love (see me)
Every time what you sing writings of my dream
Hear me (i know i’ll find a way)
Ohhh

Hey you (hear me)
Hear me (see me)
Can you see me (know all i can show you)
Try to trust me (trust me)
Trust me (i know i’ll find a way)
I know, i know
I’ll find a way, yeah (see me)
