[Intro]
Catch
Catch

[Verse 1]
Feel you pulling on my lifeline
Spinning faster than the hands of time, tick-tock
I let you in just to push you back
Slow release, I'm a fool for that
And now we're dancing under moonlight

[Pre-Chorus]
Floating away with someone to hold on
Starting to break, you gonna stay or sink to the bottom?
If you feel an emotion, let the waves carry us
Tides that can change, love is a game
Can you wait any longer?

[Chorus]
If you catch onto this
Then close your eyes, take a risk
I'll let you explore, unlock my body for you
I'm tracing your fingertips
The taste of love on my lips
I'll let you explore, unlock my body for you (yeah)
Catch (yeah)
Catch (yeah)
Catch (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Feel you pulling on my heartstrings
Perfect tuning at the perfect time, la la
The sounds you make, like a lullaby
Back and forth, you got me hypnotized
Only covered by the night sky

[Pre-Chorus]
Floating away with someone to hold on
Starting to break, you gonna stay or sink to the bottom?
If you feel an emotion, let the waves carry us
Tides that can change, love is a game
Can you wait any longer?

[Chorus]
If you catch onto this
Then close your eyes, take a risk
I'll let you explore, unlock my body for you
I'm tracing your fingertips
The taste of love on my lips
I'll let you explore, unlock my body for you (yeah)
Catch (yeah)
Catch (yeah)
Catch (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Floating away with someone to hold on
Starting to break, you gonna stay or sink to the bottom?
If you feel an emotion, let the waves carry us
Tides that can change, love is a game
Can you wait any longer?

[Chorus]
If you catch onto this
Then close your eyes, take a risk
I'll let you explore, unlock my body for you
I'm tracing your fingertips
The taste of love on my lips
I'll let you explore, unlock my body for you (yeah)
Catch (yeah)
Catch (yeah)
Catch (yeah)
