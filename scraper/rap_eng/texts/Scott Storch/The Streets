[Intro]
Yea
Turn the music up a little bit
[*Nate Dogg in background] Dah-dah-daaah
Uh, yea

Lah-dah-daaah
A little bit louder . . right there

Dah-dah-daaah
[Nate Dogg] In the name of the streets

[Verse 1: WC]
Click click boo ya! Dub kicked the frame in (uh huh)
Nigga, let the games begin
As I stand in, tossed the tall can on a campus
Out the land of the scandalous, takin' penitentiary chances
Sick wit it, off the ric wit it
Blue beanie knitted; freshly acquitted
Grind-grimey, the big body and the big body
Wit lyrics and 'draulics hotter than the Mojave
Sellin', global bailin', career felon
Escalade, 3-braid beard wearin'
Fuck it, I thug for free and thug to eat
Niggas call me hog head 'cause I love the cheese
Gangstas, hustlas, pimps, if ya follow me
Let me see ya put them hands up like a robbery
I solemnly swear to stay down and slang the C
I spit in the name of the streets

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I'm gonna roll (I'm gonna roll)
I'm gon' stay fly (I'm gonna stay fly)
I'm gonna bust (I'm gonna bust)
Hold my hood up high (Throw my hood up high)
In the name of the streets
I'm gonna roll (I'm gonna roll)
I'm gon' rich ride (I'm goin' rich ride)
I'm gonna ball (I'm gonna ball)
Hold my hood up high
In the name of the streets

[Verse 2: WC]
This is for them G niazz
Dub-S and my East niazz
Both side street niazz
This is for them DJ's coast to coast movin' this
Spin-ni-nin them turntables, that bomb Peruvian
Smashous, best trappers for cash and
Dumpin' blunt ashes outta them S-Classes
This is for them riders, ridin' for them M's
Ghetto ass niazz on them big shiny rims (uh huh)
Thrashin' ya, back at ya, bringin' it massive
I drop it on ya drastic, another hood classic
Dump the "Ghetto Heisman," seeing more cabbage
A street nia livin' on CEO status
Unlock the rack, Def Jam, cock it back
Recess is over, I want my spot back
Who's the next out the city to blow, coming at 'em
In a Pea coat and Stacy Adams, you're lookin' at 'em

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I'm gonna roll (I'm gonna roll)
I'm gon' stay fly (I'm gonna stay fly)
I'm gonna bust (I'm gonna bust)
Hold my hood up high (Throw my hood up high)
In the name of the streets
I'm gonna roll (I'm gonna roll)
I'm gon' rich ride (I'm goin' rich ride)
I'm gonna ball (I'm gonna ball)
Hold my hood up high
In the name of the streets

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
I told a woman I don't love her but she wants to go
I told another that I want her but she wants to ho
I ain't a hater, I'm a player so I fucked 'em both
In the name of the streets

[Outro: WC + (Nate Dogg)]
(Dah-dah-daaah) Yeah
(Lah-dah-daaah) Dub-C
(Dah-dah-daaah) The "Ghetto Heisman"
(In the name of the streets)
Swangin' through a hood near you
(Dah-dah-daaah...Lah-dah-daaah...Dah-dah-daaah...)
(In the name of the streets)
