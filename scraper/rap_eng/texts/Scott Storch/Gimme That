[Intro]
Storch, oh, S. Dot, yeah, the dynamic duo
Wow womp womp womp, it's what your body saying, Chris Brown is in the building

[Verse 1]
The young boy just turned 16 and I got
Six 4's and hot bikes that I rock
Keep three or four sweeties on my block
But all that swinging in that bikini just make 'em vicious
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop
Cause you speak in that slang that I talk
That sassy tempo with that walk
Maybe the reason that all these teenies may never see me

[Chorus]
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme, gimme, gimme
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme, gimme, gimme

[Verse 2]
Ma, take a break, let me explain to you
What your body got a young boy ready to do
If you take a chance to let me put them thangs on you
I could show you why I make them straight A's at school
I'm a hustler, trust my frame and age
Got you thinking that I'm just too young to turn your page
I can picture us switching lanes
In the Coupe, with you on the phone screaming my name (Chris!)

[Chorus]
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme, gimme, gimme
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme, gimme, gimme

[Bridge]
Girl you serious and I been watching you
This's what your body's saying
Hey, yeah, this what your body's saying, (Oww)

[Chorus]
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme, gimme, gimme
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme, gimme, gimme

[Outro]
VA, yeah ha
Yeah ma don't be fronting like you don't know what's going on, aight, yeah
