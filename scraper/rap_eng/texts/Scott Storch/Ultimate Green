[Intro]
We be counting this money motherfucker
Ayo, check this shit, this shit prosperous

[Hook]
We do the ultimate schemes
To make ultimate cream
(The money!)
Ultimate dreams
To sell the ultimate beams
(The money!)
The ultimate mean
To score ultimate G’s
(Silence)
We gotta go and make the ultimate green

[Verse 1]
All of this success makes me feel like I'm Heaven sent
I went through the struggle, just to make my presidents
My diagnosis was depression, the dollar bill’s my medicine
Fuck a mansion on the islands, I got the whole island as my residence
All these lesser Men, ain’t as fly as the jet I’m in
I spread the wealth to all my homies, whether they be black or they be mexican
I enjoy the status of being regarded as benevolent
And by the time I wipe out my foes they be considered deficit
Think of me as a decadent but I think on the plane of an Edison
Cause schemes flash in my mind like a light bulb, and my fashion style elegant
No one could connect me to shit, fuck all the evidence
Thrown out like gutter trash, I be setting precedents
I hire anyone and everybody, motherfuck a prejudice
Everything is prosperous, my position is eminence
Better call me your excellence, or you’ll be shot up in your tenements
Either way though, when I die, all you fucks will stay irrelevant

[Hook]

[Verse 2: The UltimateDJ391]
I used to think rapping at 16 was ill until last year I grossed double in mil
That shit thirty-two, money got me lots of brew, trees and cake but no pill
I decide to fill my life with some memorable proof that I have some juice
Along with gin, peace, kicking my tree raps with a deuce
Get my cake, cook it up, stash it in a stove and sniff it whilst giving my brain a fuse
Damn I’m rolling, moving in cake movement, I’m not stalling on your tribute
This money shit got me on my head yeah I’m still rolling in minute
Hours I perceive but this shit got me like vroom vroom, boom like Zeus

[Verse 3 : The UltimateDJ 391 ]
The dollar signs grab that cherry hymen
Your cute long sleeve dress with silver lining
That ass is fine, the sight is brightening
Personality is so nice, heart warming and flying
Reefer comes with the dollar check what I’m buying
Mean clothes with big checks that circular there’s no denying
Your cute face wants to know is that me replying
Yes that is cutey no need to be crying inside and outside this assignment

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
The feds got all eyes on me like 2Pac
Either way, fuck surveillance I always got my deuce deuce cocked
I perform my power with style and grace
And when I see my enemies suffer it puts a smile on my face
I got paper pyramids, peep at my prosperity like a pharaoh
I see the fears in your eyes, and how it shivers into your marrow
I see the jealousy in you, night of the living dead like Romero
I’m a homicidal motherfucker, see the empty void right down the barrel
I’m addicted to the hustle, it’s what keeps me moving
My brushes with death and jail is what keeps me from losing
I’ve mastered the art of crime from the time I was a young man
I had so many bullets to spray that I could give you a suntan
Fifty yachts, fifty cities, possibilities are endless
As long as you keep enemies close and keep an eye on your friendships
I’ve pushed it to the limit, philosophy from me: never just go for gold
Packing the heat on me but my heart always be cold
I am Kane

[Outro: Kane & Random Ho]
Do I know you from somewhere?
Yeah, Charlie
Right.....what the fuck do you want? I have shit to do
I want a real man, a man who treats me right
He DOES treat you right though
Not as much as I know you would
Listen, hurry up and let's get business done, I have shit to do, I got a meeting at 5
