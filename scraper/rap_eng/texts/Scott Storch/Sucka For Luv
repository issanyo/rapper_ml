[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby I know you gon' blame me for another problem (Na na noo)
Know everybody got some skeletons in their closet
You always saying I don't love you right? (I know you would)
And now you looking for somebody that's gon' do you better
I know you fuck with bitches, hope they get you wetter (Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah)
I hope you niggas get some bitches from Jamaica
Me no don give a fuck we getting paper
I know you better, when we all alone
Fuck a text message or a letter, bitch you blown?
Being sticky and fuckin' with a lame nigga
Live your life, bitch you won’t get the same with him

[Pre-Chorus]
This is how you gon’ end in your feelings
I've been a sucka for the luv gotta let it go
Cause I see that you love both [?]

[Chorus]
Because I love I love I love I can't let it go [?]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Imma do for her the best, baby
Na na I love I love I love I can't let it go

[Verse 2]
When I lick the pussy you'll be talkin'
And I'm not gonna offer you a way out
You there bossin' right now
Give me head, turn the lights down
Come over here, let me fuck your hair up
I wanna lick it, so you think we're just fucking
