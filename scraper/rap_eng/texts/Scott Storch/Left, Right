Say you a thot, I'm a thot too

That's my word, you a bad bitch
I heard you eat your rice and cabbage
You could have the cash and the plastic
But tonight I gotta have it
Got that D'usse in my cup
Put my tongue in it, I don't give a fuck
I ain't lyin', girl, I'm a champ
I'ma beat the pussy up
Long back out, make her tap out
Hit the strip club, throw a stack out
Sippin' D'usse 'til we black out
