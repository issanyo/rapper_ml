Remember when rappers had swing like Wimbledon?
Now they all ash like Arthur, just simpletons
Peons, underlings, slaves to my utterings...

Remember when rappers had swing like Wimbledon?
Now they all ash like Arthur, just simpletons
Peons, underlings, slaves to my utterings

Pinky rings like nice things down tight jeans
Lick nut up like melted cones of ice cream
Freaky bitch make a preacher stutter, yeah
Sneaky bitch try to fuck your brother, yeah
But still come home and meet your mother
No prob
Keep in in the fam like Kennedy
Johnny, Bobby
If she got a hot mom I can fuck [?]
Fuck her 'til her knees wobbly
It's just a hobby
Go ahead girl, work your body
My porn star name is Smackula
Bram Stroker
No cards, dick hard, it's strip poker
Bust on the sofa
Protection on like you granny couch
Fuck [?] 'til she passed out

[Hook:]
[Pooh Bear:]
Kiss my brain 'fore you kiss my neck, show respect
One track mind, all I think about is sex (Yeah)

[Bishop:]
Benzes, rims, yeah, spark is so tremendous
Get the money first, it comes with the bitches

[Pooh Bear:]
Kiss my brain 'fore you kiss my neck, show respect
Mind in the gutter, all I dream about is sex (Yeah)

[Bishop:]
Benzes, rims, yeah, spark is so tremendous
Get the money first, it comes with the bitches

Pussy niggas never learn
And as the world turns
Another pussy whips and tricks what he learns
I'm fire, give you third degree burns
It makes you make a pimp cup out your urn

It's my turn
You had yours
Had whores
I got 'em running naked 'cross marble floors
On all fours, yes, all four
Bent over on the couch playing hardcore
And all for the four, yours truly
Hop from pussy to pussy like a porno movie
Do we
See the picture clear, rappers disappear
My rhyme is fine wine, get better year after year
Jealous niggas I swing on
I lump up your forehead now you look like a Klingon
I lump up your forehead now you look like a Klingon
Bitch niggas better leave it 'lone or bring it on

[Hook]

Say here we go, another rapper talkin' 'bout material
Forgive me, I used to not have milk for my Cheerios
Now I cash checks [?]
[?] knocking [?] in the stereo
Imagine top models and extra large Magnums
Rip that freaky shit
Then I leave that hickey bitch
Yeah I'm on that player shit
Got that free agent pick
Plus I don't need no stress my girl to flip
From Long Beach to South Beach, nigga, in a heartbeat
Macking bitches down on College Street

Yeah they so enticing
Sweet like icing
But before we get to fucking let me see your license

My nigga D got the Rover and the Lambo
Hater get close, I'll crack your tooth enamel

Ain't it funny I'm a backpacker getting money
Old school droppin' fools
Guess I'm just that clumsy

[Hook]
