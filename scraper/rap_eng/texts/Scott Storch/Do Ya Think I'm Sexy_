[Verse 1]
She sits alone, waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous, avoiding all her questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking?

[Chorus]
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know (let me know)
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so (tell me so, babe)

[Interlude]
If you think I'm sexy, let me know

[Verse 2]
He's acting shy, looking for the answer
Come on, honey, let's spend the night together
Now hold on a minute, before we go much further
Give me a dime, so I can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his high rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

[Chorus]
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know (let me know)
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so (tell me so, babe)

[Interlude]
If you think I'm sexy, let me know

[Bridge]
His heart's beating like a drum
'Cause at last, he's got this girl home
Relax, baby, now we're all alone
Ow!

[Breakdown]
Sexy
Sexy
Sexy

[Verse 3]
They wake at dawn, 'cause all the birds are singing
Two total strangers, but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside it's cold, misty and it's raining
They got each other, neither one's complaining
He says, "I'm sorry ,but I'm out of milk and coffee."
Never mind, sugar, we can watch the early movie

[Chorus]
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know (let me know, babe)
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so (come on, honey, let me know)

[Outro]
Let me know, baby
Da, da
