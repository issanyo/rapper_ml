[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
Front line, back line, side to side
You want it? You can get it, we can do this all night
We can do this, Rosa (Rosa), don't tell your mani
You know I got it, with the Mulignane
I'm on your body, don't tell nobody
Bitch, don't be cocky, I'm on your body
I got this Henny in my cup, I just wanna make love
Don't tell your boyfriend, no, we gon' get naughty

[Pre-Chorus: 6ix9ine]
Baby, I don't really wanna fight right now
I just really want you on top right now
Why you really wanna run your mouth right now?
I just really want top right now, yeah

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
So move it closer (Move it closer)
Let me control 'ya (Let me control 'ya)
Just let me hold 'ya (Just let me hold 'ya)
'Till this beat gets over

[Verse 2: Lil' Ak]
I been sippin' Henny all night
And it got me feeling alright
Henny real nice, got it on ice
Beat the pussy pretty, no lie
Fuck around and make you my wife
Change your life, I can really change your life
Put you in a brand new ride, here's your high
Girl, the molly wood, heels high
Put you on a private flight (Aye!)
I could put you in the sky
I could get ya real high
Put you on a private flight
No more Spirit Airlines
I like the way you move your hips
Down due, don't worry about your lips
I got the Henny in my cup
You know I don't give a fuck
Don't tell your boyfriend
That I'm still fuckin'

[Pre-Chorus: 6ix9ine]
Baby, I don't really wanna fight right now
I just really want you on top right now
Why you really wanna run your mouth right now?
I just really want top right now, yeah

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
So move it closer (move it closer)
Let me control 'ya (let me control 'ya)
Just let me hold 'ya (just let me hold 'ya)
'Till this beat gets over
