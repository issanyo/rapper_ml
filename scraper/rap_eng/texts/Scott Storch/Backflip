[Verse 1:]
Don't give the tired act
Cause you been running 'round
The time you spend with me
You shouldn't be comin down

Don't give me no attitude
Saying what you will
And will not do
Baby, we need compromise
We're gonna make it through

[Pre-Chorus:]
Push yourself
A little more, boy
For me you gotta try a little harder
All I do is for the love of you

Show me you're always gonna be there
No matter what
You're always gonna be there
Here's what you gotta do

[Chorus:]
I wanna see you backflip
Cartwheel
Don't be cutting corners on me
Gotta give me all that you've got
I need to see it to believe it

I wanna see you backflip
For real
Show me that you really
Do feel everything
You say that you do
I need to see it to believe it

[Verse 2:]
Don't bring me no baggage
Cause I've got plenty of my own
Bring me all your good stuff
Baby, leave the rest at home

You've got your own philosophy
Wanna hear all that you believe
But if it ain't about being faithful
Then it ain't impressing me

[Repeat Pre-Chorus:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

Just to be with you
There's nothing I won't do

Gonna walk

Cart

Just to be with you
There's nothing I won't do

I wanna see you backflip

[Repeat Chorus:]
