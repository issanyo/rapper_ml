[Verse 1:]
Chop chop (chop chop)
Yeah I'm back on the block (on the block)
Just like that shit them nigga's cook up and rock (cook up and rock)
06' yeah I'm fit to just drop (just drop)
Had to have it, went and got it off the lot (off the lot)
Its essential presidential like my green (like my green)
Promethazine and codeine naw lean (naw lean)
Stay clean mug always mean (mug mean)
Still ride with the red beam team (beam team)
Still post it up, still same spot (same spot)
Shit workin out the block five hot (five hot)
Money gettin' made nigga's gettin paid (gettin' paid)
Nigga's keep em workin' Chevy's gettin' sprayed

(Chorus 2x: Mario)
Chop chop (chop chop) yeah I'm back on the block
We got it ready for you staight out the pot
Chop chop (chop chop) yeah I'm back on the bock
Aye we got it ready, yeah we got it ready

[Verse 2:]
Now in spite of what ya heard I'm the God damn truth
I'm a down south head busta monsta in this booth
I'm a hardcore badass
A soldier from the backstreet
And tell a mothafucker who, who ever try to cross me
Some call me J-bone, others call me Herringbone
And yes see I'm a Youngblood
And these bitches they won't leave me 'lone
Right or wrong
You should know the difference not to never speak
Run and tell yo mama and yo daddy how your shit is weak
50 deep
Yeah nigga
This ain't what you want in life
Or what you need
Cuz see our pressure will bust a pipe
Cuz like tonight
Ain't no doubt we blowin on that thing
That purple kush
That presidential shit is what I mean

(Chorus 2x: Mario)
Chop chop (chop chop) yeah I'm back on the block
We got it ready for you staight out the pot
Chop chop (chop chop) yeah I'm back on the bock
Eh we got it ready, yeah we got it ready

[Verse 3:]
Lets get to it (lets get to it)
Gotta get this money mane (get this money mane)
Ridin' spinnas, no one stop us, countin hundreds mane (countin hundreds mane)
Game was gravy shorty I can count a hundred thangs
Snatchin engines every week and got me ridin lovely mane (ridin lovely man)
24's, engine from another frame (notha frame)
26, but shawty knee deep in the game (in the game)
Get me 26, I snatch a nigga chain
26 years of pain, you would do the same thang (same thang)
But I'm gettin older me and God ain't got closer
Still keep a toaster
Fuck around and I'll roast ya
Talk big shit, nigga swang big thangs (big thangs)
When that trunk pop that thang go chop mane

(Chorus 2x: Mario)
Chop chop (chop chop) yeah I'm back on the block
We got it ready for you staight out the pot
Chop chop (chop chop) yeah I'm back on the bock
Eh we got it ready, yeah we got it ready

[Bridge: Mario]
See what done happened is we back up on your block again
Them damn fools out the back stackin' dividends
Atlanta Georgia out to get ya so don't be afraid
Just be aware and watch yo ass when you from the play (?)
Maniacs off the wall
Real nigga's never fall
Pimpin' by the day and through the week I'm gone keep it raw
I put it down
Let 'em know there's plenty ways of makin' dough
Cuz all I buy I smoke and I got plenty more
Through the door
Stampedin' like a pack of hungry wolves
And still keep it poppin, hopein', wishin', anotha nigga would
Backwoods
Dirty south, don't make me bust you in the mouth
Dont make me act a fool
And clear this whole damn place out

(Chorus 4x: Mario)
Chop chop (chop chop) yeah I'm back on the block
We got it ready for you staight out the pot
Chop chop (chop chop) yeah I'm back on the bock
Eh we got it ready, yeah we got it ready
