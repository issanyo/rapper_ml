[Intro]
Yeah, hey

[Chorus]
Say if you with me, baby, play your part then
And don't you be listenin' what bitches be startin'
And if you rock with me then rock with me regardless
We ball on these bitches just like Jordan and Harden, yeah
Hop in the G5, baby, park your car then
And if they want problems then them pistols, we sparkin'
You got a opinion then I want you to voice it
Ask about me, lil' baby, promise I go the hardest, yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby, gotta play your part like an actress
Sent your ass on a blacklist
All a nigga wanna do is stack chips
On airplane mode, don't ask shit
I really ain't with all this rap shit
Started in the street with the trap shit
Don't work for UPS but I pack shit
I might put your ho on the track shit
Got a Rollie on the wrist, that plain jane
They ain't for all the lame games
All I wanna do is maintain
Me and all my niggas on the same thing
Free all my niggas in the chain gang
All my shooters that bang bang
Lock that gun, then bang bang
Burn off on the scene and change lanes
Why you listen to shit them bitches tell you?
Real recognize real, you don't look familiar
How you gon' let them bitches feel you
'Bout all them lies them bitches said?
Little bitch better quit being rebellious
How you don't see them bitches jealous?
Won't see you happy, them bitches selfish
Dog-ass hoes, these bitches won't get it

[Chorus]
Say if you with me, baby, play your part then
And don't you be listenin' what bitches be startin'
And if you rock with me then rock with me regardless
We ball on these bitches just like Jordan and Harden, yeah
Hop in the G5, baby, park your car then
And if they want problems then them pistols, we sparkin'
You got a opinion then I want you to voice it
Ask about me, lil' baby, promise I go the hardest, yeah

[Verse 2]
Just 'cause I don't post you on the 'Gram
That don't mean I don't love you or I don't give a damn
Keep my business out the news, I'm protecting my fam
And if they tell you otherwise, baby, they not your friend, yeah
Just 'cause they postin' shit don't mean they happy
Soon as a problem come, they gon' run at you, laughin'
Stop worryin' 'bout what they think, lil' mama, that's so tacky
Ain't none of that shit genuine, baby if you ask me, yeah
Hey, rock with me like you supposed to
I knew you was it when I chose you
Don't you worry 'bout them hoes, boo
They just doin' what hoes do
Won't let none of these bitches ho
Say the ones that hurt you, ones you close to
Talk behind your back and roast you
Time'll tell, it'll show you

[Chorus]
Say if you with me, baby, play your part then
And don't you be listenin' what bitches be startin'
And if you rock with me then rock with me regardless
We ball on these bitches just like Jordan and Harden, yeah
Hop in the G5, baby, park your car then
And if they want problems then them pistols, we sparkin'
You got a opinion then I want you to voice it
Ask about me, lil' baby, promise I go the hardest, yeah
