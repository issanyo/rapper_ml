In the bay (?)
Wit' sharks on they fist
Young Berner got gills behind his jaws
Squares on his hands and feet
He's the big pescado
The mothafuckin' envisionado goin' full throttle
From the San Francisco sewer to a entrepreneur
Poppin' champagne bottles, fuckin' top notch models
Hittin' switches on bitches and leavin' snitches in ditches
Smokin' cookies by the pound
Real niggas love it, suckas frown
And if ya can't swim from town to town
You bound to drown
And if ya black or brown they tryna lock us down
Young Berner from the underground
To the top of the mound
Where everybody wanna hound and hang around
Just know, a ant'll kick an elephant if he catch 'em down
So stay on ya P's and keys, keep pushin' trees
And givin' these streets what they need
And the first time a nigga violate, make 'em bleed
Impregnate his lips and menestrate his nose
And if the violations is egregious
Fill 'em full of bullet holes
