[Intro]
Welcome to the story
Of the kid chasing glory
I live to leave a legacy
My own memento mori
Easier said than done, won't be an easy run
But someone's gotta do it, maybe I'm the one
I can only hope
Down with the bumpy and the lonely road

[Verse]
I just changed my view, shit was overdue
Dealing with inner fights, like I was the Wu
Everything I do, I put my soul in it
My train of thought keep runnin', endless loads of coal in it
Run my own business, don't draw no hoes in it
Sorry if my flow's off, it's on the North Pole chilling
And I don't need no iceman, I do my own killing
Fuck you and your hand outs, I can make my own living
I guess it ain't true what you brag about
Cause in the club, you just bring Precious out
Swear it's facts what I'm rapping about
Plus, my punchlines could knock Cassius out
Want a new favourite rapper? I can fill the void
Really man, say it, what's your skill of choice?
A lotta talents hidden in this voice
Not from the Chi, but ya bet I got the illest noise
Ask anybody, I'm the greatest in here
All this on willpower like Jaden's career
The crib's all love, I don't want haters in here
Shh, everybody quiet, I'm creating in here
Bro, I heard your new tape and maybe something's wrong with me
Cause what you say is 'fuckin flames', is fucking boring me
Your music got no brain, no heart, you need Dorothy
I've heard about enough from you, we all just want some more of me
Don't you bother sending shots, Mvd immortal, see?
That mean I will live forever, there's no use in mourning me
Wake up in the morning, eat, get head and that's a mild day
Make a track a horror flick, like really, man, it's child's play
I'm fucking undefeatable, Wenger should be coaching me
An arsenal of different styles, I'm keeping them all close to me
You know how it's post to happen, you know how it's post to be
Rapper eater, devour competition like they're groceries(I'll fuckin' do it)
Fuck it, bitch, I got more jewels than a socket
Get up off my dick, or you might as well suck it
I call her LeToya Luckett, cause she's a thorn in my side
She realized my destiny, then left me behind
But damn, I took the tables, made them spin like a Dreidel
They say I can't spit, I turn to Cain, the beat's Abel
Okay
I'm on my Maury Povich, you are not the dopest
Rappers let me spit a verse and ask me not to roast them
Don't have to treat you well boy, rap's no hotel boy
But we deal with baggage, we should be the bellboys
And man, some of my peers straight outta hell boy
Fuck with a cold man, you'll catch a big L boy
Buzy tryna stand up on my own feet
Seen homies fucked up, saying 'I have to drown the old me'
Mood swings made their MO to OD
But everytime I tried to stop 'em, I got cold feet
Goddamn

[Outro]
One more buzy night
Murdered this fuckin' beat and no sorry can make it right
Mvd!
