Jay-Z:
Oooh Boy, I Know Where You Gonna Be Tonight
Come A Little Bit Closer
Touch Me Baby Don't Be Shy
And You Know I'm Here Too
We Can Do Those Things You Like
Come A Little Bit Closer
Touch Me Baby Dont' Be Shy, Dont' Be Shy

[Verse 1:]
Shortie What'cha Know About
Growing Up, Showing Up
Acting Like You Touching Some You Can't Do Without
Inhale, Throw It Out
Pass It On, Throw It Out
Ju, Just Shake It And The Rest Just Stop Blowing It Out
Break That, Show Off
White Lap, Twenty Four, Judgde, You Just Naving Some, Jsut Hand It Over Bring Me More
Click Door Sat Our Door Make Them Wanna Get It On
Twenty Four, Stick Fresh, Chain Long, Bulls Go
Oh No, Heat's Back, Heat Lap, Go Slow
We Have To Stick, Get Rich, Hobo, You Don't Kiss Her Just Get Slowgo
Oh...What'cha Know 'bout Me
The More Shit I Spend The More Dough I See
Hello Mami, You Kno Papi
You Can Call Me Anyone You Know The Crap, Hello Ali

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Presidents Should Never Flow
Lips Change, Lovers Choke
It's So Hard (Swear To God I'll Make The Rubber Melt)
Stomach Man, Battle Song
I Was Born A Hustler Well
This Feels Too Good I Never Wanna Buy A Dell
Suitcase, Real Torch, Move To, Nsync
Kick My Victims, This My Big Chacne
Big Grand, Top Screen, Free Grade, Switch Clanes
Check It Check It, I'm Trying To Keep Playing
