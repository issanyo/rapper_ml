[Intro: Young Jeezy]
It's M.C. and Y.J
Another hit, OK
We looking fly, taking off
Saw us on a runway
On any given Sunday
Monday, Tuesday
They try to confuse me
I never let them use me

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I was a girl, you was a man
I was too young to understand
I was naive, I just believed
Everything that you told me
Said you were strong, protecting me
Then I found out that you were weak
Keeping me there, under your thumb
'Cause you were scared that I'd become much
More than you could handle
Shining like a chandelier
That decorated every room inside
The private hell we built
And I dealt with it
Like a kid, I wished I could fly away

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
But instead, I kept my tears inside
'Cause I knew if I started, I'd keep crying
For the rest of my life with you
I finally built up the strength to walk away
Don't regret it, but I still live with the side effects

[Hook: Mariah Carey]
Waking up scared some nights
Still dreaming about them violent times
Still little protective about the people that I let inside
Still little defensive thinking about me trying to run my life
Still little depressed inside
I fake a smile and deal with the side effects (Oh, oh)
Side effects (Oh, oh)
Side effects (Oh, oh)
Side effects (Oh, oh)

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
Vacant inside, no one was there
Couldn't be real, had to keep quiet
Once in awhile, put up a fight
It's just too much, night after night
After awhile, I would just lie
You was dead wrong, daid you was right
Did what I could just to survive
Couldn't believe this was my life
Flickering like a candle
Doing my best to handle sleeping with the enemy
Aware that he was smothering every last part of me
So I broke away and finally found the strength to leave

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Still kept the tears inside
'Cause I knew if I started I'd keep crying
For the rest of my life with you
I finally built up the strength to walk away
Don't regret it, but I still live with the side effects

[Hook: Mariah Carey]
Waking up scared some nights
Still dreaming about them violent times
Still little protective about the people that I let inside
Still little defensive thinking about me trying to run my life
Still little depressed inside
I fake a smile and deal with the side effects (Oh, oh)
Side effects (Oh, oh)
Side effects (Oh, oh)
Side effects (Oh, oh)
(Hey, hey, hey, let's go!)

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Hey magnification or should I say magnificent?
It is nothing worth your happiness
And I am not caring who you're with
Misery loves company
So we are not trying to hang with you all
Hurt you if you let them in
Got to keep you circle small
Keep trying to play
I tell him I am not blowing though
Think they want me out to here
I tell them I am not going though
Side effects be drowsiness
Loneliness
How is this?
I think the call it hate ration
What can you prescribe for this?

[Bridge: Mariah Carey]
Forgive, but I can't forget
Every day I deal with this
I live with the side effects
But I ain't gon' let them get the best of me
Forgive, but I can't forget
Every day I deal with this
I live with the side effects
But I ain't gon' let them get the best of me

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
But instead, I kept my tears inside
'Cause I knew if I started I'd keep crying
For the rest of my life with you
I finally built up the strength to walk away
(The strength to walk away)
Don't regret it, but I still live with the side effects

[Hook: Mariah Carey]
Waking up scared some nights (hey, hey)
Still dreaming about them violent times (Said I still wake up)
Still little protective about the people that I let inside (Cryin)
Still little defensive thinking about me trying to run my life
Still little depressed inside
I fake a smile and deal with the side effects (Oh, oh)
Side effects (Oh, oh)
Side effects (Oh, oh)
Side effects (Oh, oh)
