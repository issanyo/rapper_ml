[Intro]
Uh, uh, some deep shit
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Momma please stop crying, I can't stand the sound
Your pain is painful and it's tearin' me down
I hear glasses breaking as I sit up in my bed
I told dad you didn't mean those nasty things you said

[Verse 2]
You fight about money, 'bout me and my brother
And this I come home to, this is my shelter
It ain't easy growing up in World War III
Never knowing what love could be, you'll see
I don't want love to destroy me like it has done my family

[Chorus]
Can we work it out? (Can we?) Can we be a family? (Can we?)
I promise I'll be better (I promise)
Mommy, I'll do anything (I'll do anything)
Can we work it out? Can we be a family?
I promise I'll be better
Daddy, please don't leave

[Verse 3]
Daddy please stop yelling (Stop)
I can't stand the sound (Can't stand the sound)
Make momma stop cryin', 'cause I need you around
My mama she loves you (I know it)
No matter what she says, its true
I know that she hurts you
But remember I love you, too

[Verse 4]
I ran away today
Ran from the noise, ran away (Ran away)
Don't wanna go back to that place
But don't have no choice, no way
It ain't easy growin' up in World War III
Never knowing what love could be, well I've seen
I don't want love to destroy me like it did my family

[Chorus]
Can we work it out? (Can we work it out?) Can we be a family?
I promise I'll be better, Mommy I'll do anything
(I promise I'll do anything to keep you there)
Can we work it out? Can we be a family?
I promise I'll be better (I promise, I promise)
Daddy, please don't leave

[Verse 5]
In our family portrait (In our family portrait)
We look pretty happy (We look pretty happy)
Let's play pretend, let's act like it comes naturally
(Let's play, let's play, let's play pretend)
I don't wanna have to split the holidays
I don't want two addresses
I don't want a step-brother anyways
And I don't want my mom to have to change her last name

[Chorus]
In our family portrait we look pretty happy
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
In our family portrait we look pretty happy
Let's play pretend, act like it goes naturally

[Chorus]
In our family portrait we look pretty happy
(Can we work it out? Can we be a family?)
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
(I promise I'll be better, Mommy I'll do anything)
In our family portrait we look pretty happy
(Can we work it out? Can we be a family?)
Let's play pretend act and like it comes so naturally
(I promise I'll be better, Daddy please don't leave)
In our family portrait we look pretty happy
(Can we work it out? Can we be a family?)
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that
(I promise I'll be better, Daddy please don't leave)

[Bridge]
Daddy don't leave
Daddy don't leave
Daddy don't leave
Turn around please
Remember that the night you left, you took my shining star?
Daddy don't leave
Daddy don't leave
Daddy don't leave
Don't leave us here alone

[Outro]
Mom will be nicer
I'll be so much better, I'll tell my brother
Oh, I won't spill the milk at dinner
I'll be so much better, I'll do everything right
I'll be your little girl forever
I'll go to sleep at night
