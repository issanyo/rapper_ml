[Intro]
Huh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ha, uh, uh, uh
What, some more some more
Some more some more, niggas didn't want no more

[Verse 1]
Now (now) ready for whylin' my niggas
Let's set it like we on the Island my niggas
I'm with it (what what, wha-what what)
Yo, my clique startle bitches
With a remarkable sparkle for my bitches with me (what what, wha-what what)
You know we stay dumb
And keep shop runnin' just the like a 24-hour deli
The way y'all niggas be poppin' that shit you be talkin'
Y'all niggas don't be nothin' but a 24-hour celly
To talk that funny shit to someone you know
While I bag these bitches and take them to 24-hour tellys
Type of chickens to let me get in they belly
Little sexy thug bitches who want me to fuck them to Makeveli
Then get with my niggas and smoke up a ounce
Crowd up in whatever amounts, makin' bitches skip to my bounce
So forever we be shinin' like diamond
Fresher than the fragrance of limon
When we strike it's all in the timin'
Corporate niggas bug on how we be stylin'
Fuckin with huge contracts with wife-beaters on
On the day of the signin'
Makin all my bitches check for this shit
My live niggas know the truth
That's why they always got respect for this shit

[Chorus]
Bust one for me, bladow
All my niggas holdin' they guns with me, bladow
And restin' and stackin' they ones with me, bladow
My peeps who hang around where I'm from with me, bladow
Who run with me, bladow
Bust one for me, bladow
My bitches that'll fuck 'til they cum with me, bladow
Whylin they be havin' they fun with me, bladow
In the struggle they be beatin' they drums with me, bladow
In the slums with me, bladow
Bust one for me, bladow

[Verse 2]
And now we mash y'all, harass y'all
Until the shit we doin' pass y'all
You know we steadily readily give it to niggas
And blow up the spot for niggas before we do the dash y'all
Eh-eh-ey, eh-eh-ey-yo, ain't nothin' wrong 'til we perform
Y'all niggas know we bout to blast y'all (hah!)
Fast me and my niggas crash the party
Hit my niggas with shit and splash bitches before we flash y'all
Now whassup? All of my niggas salute
When we get busy give me my loot, or lay up in a box with a suit
Shit that I tell you will all be the truth
Stay on a live nigga recruit, and take y'all niggas back to the root
Tyin' my laces all up in my boot
All the bitches say that I'm cute, blowin' on it just like a flute
Now now now, before we blind y'all we shine and remind y'all
Shit we got be always one of a kind y'all
We constructin' a new design y'all
Better keep up my niggas because you will get left behind y'all
Let us bust a bottle of wine now
And celebrate in the name of them niggas that control the times now
Now watch it, as we just pick up the pace
You just might a hole in your face
My crew might take a whole of the space
Completely, obligated just to keepin' you dumbin'
And get to breakin' all the shit up in club once you know that we comin'
My bitches check for this shit
My live niggas know the truth
That's why they always got respect for this shit

[Chorus]
Bust one for me, bladow
All my niggas holdin' they guns with me, bladow
And restin' and stackin' they ones with me, bladow
My peeps who hang around where I'm from with me, bladow
Who run with me, bladow
Bust one for me, bladow
My bitches that'll fuck 'til they cum with me, bladow
Whylin they be havin' they fun with me, bladow
In the struggle they be beatin' they drums with me, bladow
In the slums with me, bladow
Bust one for me, bladow

[Outro]
Yeah
To all my niggas and all my bitches that just wanna live
Live good, feel good, yeah
Just bounce to this shit, c'mon, bounce to this shit
All my niggas and my bitches just bounce to this shit
C'mon, bounce to this shit
Yeah, Flipmode constantly
Enough of that
