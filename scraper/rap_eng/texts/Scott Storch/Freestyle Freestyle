Redman in the house, ya don't stop
Gilla House in the house, ya don't stop
Def Squad in the house, ya don't stop
Wu Tang in the house, ya don't stop
Hip-Hop in the house, ya don't stop

Redman gotta light that green
People always say, "What the hell does that mean?"

Wussup homeboy I'm a muhfuckin' rider
Custom made Airs and my shoes never tied up
Hardcore shit, do it eazier than wider
While you sittin' home gettin' baby mama drama
Jersey, Uptown - go pick my weed up
Broke? I ain't turning your C to a D cup
Bitch I'm a G! I never give my keys up
Not even half if you didn't sign a pre-nupt
Watch how we thump
I'm 'bout my bid-ness
You about to go downtown like the shiznit
Witness! Yeah boy
I get ya dumb like white people lookin' for weird noise
Hood down, got B. Smalls on my white tee
And my chain look like an italian icee
Redman nigga
Grind like brakes
Cause I'm after that cake
Like Steadman nigga!

Freestyle, Freestyle, Freestyle
Freestyle, Freestyle, Freestyle
And everywhere I go I kick a freestyle
And every time I move these women freestyle
Freestyle, Freestyle, Freestyle
Freestyle, Freestyle, Freestyle
Redman gotta light that green
People always say, "What the hell does that mean?"

Okay yo, I got Bricks in the building
Young kids out here, flip ya like Wilson
Pilgrim! There it is
The block is Tina Marie, yeah I'm on my square biz
Turn up the kid like volume ten
And you could brown-nose me 'til the album in
You was hot when your style was in
Now ya lookin' at Gilla, "I wish I was down with them"
No time to turn back, I keep my eyes focused
Slow like I'm on the I-95 smoking
Like Ocean's Twelve
When I'm postin' smell
My zip lock when the red line open
Fat girls like, "Yo that's my hero."
Enough of them to pull a Five-Five-Zero
Incog-negro, after the cream
I'm in your hood like (WatchTime?) magazine
I mean, for bullshit my nose keen
And only takes one hit to get in those jeans
It's not your ass, girl it's your brain
Now when I hit it I keep the chicken lo mein
Back on the train like "Who the hell are you?"
I'm Doc, I bring heat like number 32
Brick city niggas, yeah yeah a rider
La-La-La don't steal my damn lighter
See I'm on point, never catch me slippin'
Storch on the track, watch how Reggie rip it
Sniff it, you'll know it's on again
Walked in this muhfucka like I own da bitch
I'm not in Cancun
I'm out in Grant tomb
On one wheel throwing it up like, "Man move!"
Back on my grizzly, yeah take that
You want the crack
I prepared it ASAP!

[Hook]

Wussup homegirl we a muhfuckin riders
Met her outside of the Copacabana
Far from a sucka, pull out the 'lama
And tell on myself like, "Yo well your honor..."
See, I blast on sight when I move
That battery pack on my back stay full
I ain't no joke, I keep y'all steppin'
Doc got next nigga drop y'all weapon
Screen on my mic got hash tar resins
Engineer fucked up, laughing all reckless
I'm like, "Shutup! Gilla house got this."
Arms grew longer for my short pockets
Stop it? I wish I can
I'm trying to be building green like MGM Grand
Get it? Redman, who the fuck are you?
Got weed? Let me bust a U nigga!

[Hook]

Gilla, Gilla, Gilla, Gilla
