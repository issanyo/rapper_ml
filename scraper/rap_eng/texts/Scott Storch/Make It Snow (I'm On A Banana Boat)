[Intro]
This goes for all my homies in Tortoisea
Fiesta mofos!
You're ready? Let's go!
Yeahhh!
Tootootoowoo!!!

[Hook (x2)]
Yo, banana boats
Make it snow on your host
I do what I does
You fuck me like a bus
I does whatever I wants
My music is better than James Blunt's

[Verse 1]
Make it snow
Make it snow
I make it snow on them boats
Banana boats
Like a banana
Fresh bandana
And I got a boat
Grocery bag
Let's chase the flag
Don't let love take over
Or it will be game over
Banana boats are good
I am from the hood
"The fruit is shit"
Dontcha agree with it?
I make it snow like Nevada in the spring
And google totally pwns bing
Guess who's back?
Clayton's back, tell a friend
Cuz I'm back with a brand new rap
If you don't like my shit
Stop listening, bitch
Man, you must be out of your mind
You could teach me how to grind
My ass is hot as hell
That girl rings a bell
G-like girls are funny
Like the easter bunny
Yo, I'm on a banana boat
You should leave and take your goat

[Hook (x2)]
Yo, banana boats
Make it snow on your host
I do what I does
You fuck me like a bus
I does whatever I wants
My music is better than James Blunt's

[Verse 2]
Yeahh!
I am a beast
Watch me niggas, singing my beats
You gay bitch
You use fitch
Motherfucker
I love chicks with miranca
So what nigga, fuck you
I hit you like a turkey crying glu-glu
Look at my cash flow
Ace ace wow
Do you think I'm fuckin dumb?
So check out my lovely fat hump
You better get this shit away
Or I'll do it in a evil way
Pussy is good
Who knows the best is Ace Hood
Cuz he fucks, fucks, fucks
He looks like a family of ducks
Lose virginity with hoes is for cowards
So kids get out of my gardens
Space jam gardens!
Def of mixtapes! BadenBaden's
My niggas kill for good
Man I should hate the hood
This is my life motherfucker
Yeah, Tortoise, Clayton, here

[Hook (x2)]
Yo, banana boats
Make it snow on your host
I do what I does
You fuck me like a bus
I does whatever I wants
My music is better than James Blunt's

[Verse 3]
Hey, my nigga, in my head you're gay
Oh, wait, in the real world too, heey
Ohhh yeahhhh
I'm maaaaad
I see you all over my head
I'm punching you really bad
Yo, there are many girls in your life
But some are crazy and wanna be your wife
Be careful if you make sex with maids
You might end up getting AIDS
I suck mothasuckass
You are from Kansas
I wait for minutes
Just to get my lieutenents
I grow up in the fucking stage
I'm on fire but I've been a blaze
This shit ain't mine
This fuck is like wine
Wine is for gays with a bitch
The ones who use fitch
Mothafuckaaas
Than you I am stronger
But I can't hold on much longer
Pussy ass niggas are gay
And they didn't get born in may
But if you're hot
You should never get shot
My ass is aching
Yours is steady shakin
My foot slipped cuz I'm a chick
Oh, you thought I was tortoise, you brick!
Follow me are paparazzi
I say: please no photos!
Man, I like no homos
Grinding grinding grinding
Grinding on my brinding
Crazy motherfucker?
I am one
And the crazy thing is
I'll be gettin one
My swagga is so bright
I don't even need light
This motherfuckeeeeer
Runs around like a suckeeer

[Hook (x2)]
Yo, banana boats
Make it snow on your host
I do what I does
You fuck me like a bus
I does whatever I wants
My music is better than James Blunt's

[Outro]
Yeah! Make noise bitches!!! Yeah
