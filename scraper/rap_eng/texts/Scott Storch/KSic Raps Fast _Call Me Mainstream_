"Your fb stats are so fucking annoying, main stream rap is not easy. So what if they rap about the same stuff, it still takes skill to write. Easy to talk smack when your behind a computer huh? If you tried writing a "main stream" rap it would blow dick. Show some respect bitch."

[Verse 1: KSic]
Hey fuckers, my name is Karem
Got your bitch right beside and shes loving my cream
Shes layin here really pissed cause she wanted a whipped Karem
I threw her ass out my house and said you just been creamed
My money makes the bitches feel alive
Stacks so high cause the cash is the drive
I could probably climb up and give god a high five
Put he'd probably send me to hell as soon as I arrived
Cause I Live to feed eviL so get on my level
And when I fully Lived I fully fed the deviL
So if you wanna know the truth, for better or worse
Sometimes you just gotta read some words in reverse
My morale is a very twisted road
Listen closely, true moral code
Morally, all other morals are wrong
So ill share my life code and you can all rap along
I'm the illest brown brotha fuck with me and you'll fry
Sting me once bitch you will die
You're a bee I'm a wasp, my sting has evolved
Ill kill your whole family with their murders unsolved
Blood on my hands but you won't see me cry
Fuck Peter Griffin and all family guys
Shinning bullets to your dom cause that's how I roll
RedruM, redruM then I steal your soul
You won't R.I.P I'm Brown and my mind is vast
Ill invert this bitch and go back to the past
I'm a time terror rest and and you know whats ahead
Death, then I let the terror rest around your bed
I got that Cartmen swag, I win again and again
Treating all theses bitches like they're Scott Tenorman
Call me Funnybot even if you think its absurd
I'm so hilarious and deadly that it gets awkward
Is Medusa looking at me cause I'm starting to get stoned
Cloud 9 man my lungs are getting owned
I up Jesus one when I get this high
Cause I walk on the mass of liquid droplets moving in the sky

[Verse 2: KSic]

Everything gets so clear with my weed ammunition
Fuck Blue-ray, this is high definition
I feel electric someone call an electrician
I should've worked at Atomic Energy Commission
This fine ass bitch wanted my poll
She was a star and a fox so she did a barrel roll
Were done she wants more, I slam the door whoosh!
I make vagina's dirtier yet they still call me a douche
Trick OR treat, tricks are never a treat
Last one was hell, kicked her out on the street
She gave the worst head so she didn't get a lay
I guess you could say she blew me away
Tricks are the same, as they display
Wishin my heart was BK so they could have it their way
But you're not original bitch, just like the others
Ill stomp on your heart like ah Mario Brotha
I'm the best rapper alive, sharp as a blade
Cleaning up the game like I'm a fucking rap maid
Other rappers are weak, I hear your lyrics then they fade
Like my Wii your music will never get played
You're not hard killin 2 birds with one stone
I've seen that shit before you're just another clone
Plus I upped the ante to make you bitches groan
Aim the stone at the nest, whole family gets owned
Your girl wants me all she needs is a push
I stole her bro go beat around the bush
She thinks you're a dork, acquiesce
She thinks I have one, coalesce
I sneeze then hear bless you with a face of glee
Listen bitch don't push your religion on me
Trying to make me love God, like a hybrid Cupid
You what that to happen, strip and fuck me stupid
Undercover cops puller over my car
They knew who I was so it got bazaar
Around town they are know as the sexy 5-0s
I think a better name would be the sexy 5-hoes
They threw me in the backcontact increased
Like I've always said, fuck the police
I'm a fucking monster, no area of gray
"Hear that..." (music stops)
"NO! I'm so damn beast I scared the fucking beat away!"
