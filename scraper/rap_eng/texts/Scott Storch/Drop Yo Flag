[Verse 1]
I got niggas in the cell block
They'll put you in a head lock
I told momma go and get me a lawyer
They ain't even gone let me bail out
A lot of niggas go to jail they don't keep it solid they just tell now
The average black kid went to school
Didn't have a father so he failed out
I'm the realest nigga since 'Pac
You gotta ask Epic, I ain't sell out
If the laws pull me over ridin around dirty nigga I'm a bail out
On my side they spot, yea, I can't wait til they lay it out
When I jumped up out that car, them niggas damn near fell out
I don't shoot niggas from far, yea, I shoot nothing but headshots
Have you ever went to jail for a murder?
I beat two of them bitches before
Baby I love ya, I ain't mean to hurt ya
I ain't gone do that shit no more
If you start speaking on my name, I ain't gone shoot at you no more

[Chorus]
Heard you want me dead, nigga drop a bag
If you gettin money, I can fuck with that
It ain't shoppin' bitch, if you ain't poppin tags
If you gang banging, don't you drop yo flag
Heard you want me dead, nigga drop a bag
If you gettin money, I can fuck with that
It ain't shoppin' bitch, if you ain't poppin tags
If you gang banging, don't you drop yo flag

[Verse 2]
I was lackin' in school, but grandmama stayed on me
I'm gone pop a toast for every nigga ever hated on me
I take care of you baby, only if you wait on me
And if you ever cross me out, then I'm straight on ya
[?] was hard coming up, yea, I was staving coming up, yea
Every night I stayed up, yea
Hustle, trying to get bucks, yea
You don't want to know the shit I did for money
What you wanna know that I came from nothing
I can't even tell you about the robberies, about the shit I took from Connie
You don't want to know what I threw at Onyx
You don't want to know what I was sellin' at Sonic
I can't even tell you about the bustas
You don't wanna know why them niggas was running
Scared, hundred on his head, this how I play it
When I run up on you, what's that shit you said?

[Chorus]
Heard you want me dead, nigga drop a bag
If you gettin money, I can fuck with that
It ain't shoppin' bitch, if you ain't poppin tags
If you gang banging, don't you drop yo flag
Heard you want me dead, nigga drop a bag
If you gettin money, I can fuck with that
It ain't shoppin' bitch, if you ain't poppin tags
If you gang banging, don't you drop yo flag
