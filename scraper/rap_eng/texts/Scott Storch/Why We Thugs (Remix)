[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
Yeah, let's take a trip
Just sit back and light a spliff with this and don't slip
On a funky-dope track jump back
Strapped with a fat buddah sack and a 7-8 'Lac
Go clean, gangsta lean, I got green
But I serve dubs like it ain't no thing
It's so sweet, when you got money to spend
I got a proper big tilt and a fabec Benz
I make ends, spend my dough on no ho
That's how it is, and that's how it goes
Act like ya know when I creep real slow
Givin love to them playaz that I know is real G's

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Mobbin' like a motherfucker stuck
Can you put your middle finger out the window gettin' fucked off - liquor
Get loaded can't control it
Nigga pass me the blunt and let me roll it
You get the bones act to the whole stack
Keep your dough fat

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Or you might get what we call the rat pack
I gives a damn bout a skanless trick
Let me hit it one time and trick that sick
I don't trip, gives my dough to no ho
That's how it is, I got no love for ya

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
And jealous muthafuckas can't see
That it's the fame that caught these stupid bitches, pass the pussy free
So tell me why u sweatin' a muthafucka like me?
A young nigga tryin' to a hustle up some G's
You pussy ass playa hatin' hoes speakin' down on niggas
Jumpin' around at the shows
And your the first muthafucka to jump
To the trunk when it's time for fun
Little trick ass punk

[Verse 5: Eazy-E]
Dump dump on fools with a quickness
And they got no cure for this sickness
I get paid for the way that I kick this
Like a g-ster, an OG-ster (who's that?)
A real playa named Eazy
And I live my life straight crazy
Don't need no punk fools payin' me
And broke groupies and hootchies don't faze me
I take two steps back and release myself
To put platinum and gold on the record shelf
I don't brag, but I do it like a straight up iz
Before you do a record, partner, handle your business

[Verse 6: 2Pac]
And tell me what does it take to be a G?
I started with a quarter ounce and bounced to a key
You gotta watch your back stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young muthafucka doin' dirt
And now I'm in the rap game like the crack game
I got enemies
Can't pretend to see my friends are not my enemies
And even thug muthafuckas wanna have fun
Stuck it, buckin' my muthafuckin' magnum
What does it take to be a G?
Silence is a must, violence is a plus
Plus, shots at my adversaries
Dem niggas scary best it's time to be buried
Cause ill be buckin' in a fuckin' hurry

[Verse 7: Ice Cube]
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why you don't fuck with thugs
You wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck wit us (you know)
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why you don't fuck with thugs
You wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
I'm from the land of the gang bang
Since I was little, ain't a god damn thang changed
It's the same ol' same
Bush run shit like Saddam Hussein
I cock and aim, clinically insane
To deal with this bullshit day to day
If I sell some yay or smoke some hay
You bitches wanna throw me up in pelican's bay
Call me an animal up in the system
But who's the animal that built this prison
Who's the animal that invented lower living
The projects, thank god for Russell Simmons
Thank god for Sugarhill
I'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grill
Y'all know what it is, scared for your own kids
How these ghetto niggas taken over showbiz

[Outro: Ice Cube]
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Stop trippin' on me
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
