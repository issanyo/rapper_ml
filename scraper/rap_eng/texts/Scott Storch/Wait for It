[Verse 1: Berner]
You see the box full of money on the porch, yeah I prayed for it
I ain’t even have to pay the girl to let me use her name for it
We are playin’ with the mail, a few homies went away for it
They were waitin’ on my call but I couldn’t catch a case for it
Anxious waitin’ on the next run
Tell ‘em I’ma send some, I’m here 'til the check come
I was probably in the car with the weight
While you was fake, talkin ‘bout you tryna make a play
Yeah, we burn banks out and played safes out
Shit, I had to buy the bag its own place now
Bring the jack back, too many fakes out
So much work, I had to ‘cause a fake drought
Bring the bay back, I’m in my Maybach
I’m in the O, where they learned to make crack
Gold champagne, drunk textin’ and I lay flat
On the way to London, carry-on, got a 8 pack
My money back long, I bet they hate that
I was sellin’ coke, freestylin’ on the 8-track
Girl Scout Cookies, can’t believe we made that
I watched my mom die, Wiz helped be bring my faith back
Yeah, I got my bag right, fuck waitin’ on the next man
4 mil’ on the crib (4 mil’ on the crib), 150 on my left hand
Real plug talk, fuck a drug dog
Yeah, go ahead and hit me when the rest land
Real Cali shit, this two of the best to ever do it LA and San Fran
Yeah, Game go ahead and tell ‘em

[Chorus: Game]
Follow all your dreams, nigga you ain’t got to wait for it
You can have the whole world, nigga you ain’t got to wait for it
Fuck what a hater got to say, tell ‘em you ain’t got to wait for it
And if we all die one day and tomorrow ain’t promised
Why the fuck would we wait for it?

[Verse 2: Game]
Red truck outside, I just spent 200K for it
Every dollar I ever made, got to thank Dr. Dre for it
Used to dream about a ‘64, wasn’t tryna save for it
So I sold crack to the fiends on the block all day for it
Niggas wanted drama
That was cool, I just ran in the house and got a ‘K for it
Gangbangin’, I was made for it
Runnin’ from them demons and the deacon like a point guard at Wake Forest
My grandmother used to tell me that Compton was gon’ to kill me
So I wasn’t want to wait for it (wait for it, wait for it)
She was sleepin’ on my dreams, so I had to stay awake for it
Wanted Kim K so I went Kanye for it, I ain’t have to pay for it
I just bought a 10 million dollar crib, all a nigga need is a lake for
Baby momma got a 6 and she ain’t have to fuck Drake for it
They say, “Money is the root of all evil”
I seen most of you niggas turn snake for it
Real friends, real friends ain’t worried about your money ‘cause the grindin’ never break for it
Fake friend, fake friends only pop up when you rollin’ like the bottom of a skateboard
That’s when the wheels stop and you gotta cut ‘em off, even if you get the hate for it
Real love, I guess it died with ‘Pac ‘cause nigga I don’ searched the whole Golden State for it
California is mine, tell Kendrick and Snoop
I had a shootout with Steph Curry and Klay for it

[Chorus: Game]
Follow all your dreams, nigga you ain’t got to wait for it
You can have the whole world, nigga you ain’t got to wait for it
Fuck what a hater got to say, tell ‘em you ain’t got to wait for it
And if we all die one day and tomorrow ain’t promised
Why the fuck would we wait for it?

[Outro: Game]
Why the fuck would we wait for it?
You ain't got to wait for it
Wait for it wait for it
You ain’t got to wait for it
