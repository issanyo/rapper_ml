[Intro]
Hey berner (coughs)
Why they try'na copy you?

[Chorus: Kokane]
Why they hatin' on me? (yeah)
So many years in the dope game pushin' big weight
Gettin' to the cheese
Ooh wee wee
All you copycat killas can't compare to a villain like me
'Cause I feed these streets with my [?]
Neva, neva let your livin' go [?] sky
Too many foes on the [?]
And never, never claim somethin' that's not yours
Fuck around and get popped

[Verse 1: Berner]
I woke up in the mornin' and broke a zip down
Pre-rolls for the day, pulled the whips out
Both phones ringin', Facetime audio
I'm choppin' up game, we control where the (?) go
Go to the stash house to pull some cash out
Ray Ray's on the couch still passed out
Lookin' through the cabinets, we outta vac' bags
I need a few more rolls, where they grab that?
Lil' Ray Ray woke up. he said, "hit Stonestown"
Hit my watch on the counter, knocked a stone out
And now I'm grumpy as hell
I hopped in his Porsche truck
I shoulda known by the smell that we were dirty
But I'm really in a hurry
The spot close at five, I need to send a buck thirty (about thirty grand)
We should have never took Lincoln
I'm stuck up in traffic, seen an unmarked creepin' (shit)
Here go the lights for no reason
Ray ain't speakin', I can tell what he thinkin' (shhh!)
Man, don't say nada
I seen a duffel bag in the back by the [?]
How's it goin'? It smells like weed
Wait, aren't you the rapper with the store in Geneva? (yeah, that's me)
I could tell he's a fan but the other cop approached, he said, "show me your hands!" (hey, chill out, bro)
Look guys, I got a show at nine
He said this ain't about you, we wanna talk to the driver
He looked at Ray, stop wastin' my time
'Cause the homie left your house, he was wearin' a wire
Dead silence, Ray started laughin' (why you laughin', dawg?)
He opened up the door and went for the package
Grabbed the duffel, all they found was some Polo
They mad, the fan boy asked for a photo
Four o'clock when we got the spot
The thot flaked on me, had to send my own box (I hate that shit)
I started fillin' out the slip then the dude behind the counter asked Bern' for a pic
Now I know I can't trust him
It's four-fifteen, I need to set down somethin'
Look, cousin, I appreciate the love
I'll be right back, I left somethin' in my truck
Fuck

[Bridge: Berner & Kokane]
(The daily struggles of the dope game)
(Go ahead and holla at him, cocaine)
(The daily struggles of the dope game)
(Go ahead and holla at him, cocaine)
You could never walk in my shoes
You could never walk in my shoes
You could never walk in my shoes
You could never walk in my shoes

[Chorus: Kokane]
Why they hatin' on me? (yeah)
So many years in the dope game pushin' big weight
Gettin' to the cheese
Ooh wee wee
All you copycat killas can't compare to a villain like me
'Cause I feed these streets with my [?]
Neva, neva let your livin' go [?] sky
Too many foes on the [?]
And never, never claim somethin' that's not yours
Fuck around and get popped

[Outro: Berner]
They wanna walk in my shoes
I swear to God they wanna walk in my shoes
They wanna walk in my shoes
I swear to God they wanna walk in my shoes
They wanna walk in my shoes
I swear to God they wanna walk in my shoes
They wanna walk in my shoes
I swear to God they wanna walk in my shoes
