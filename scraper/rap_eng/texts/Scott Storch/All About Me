[Verse 1]
If you could have heard my heart
You'd know that it was beating for you
If you could have read my mind
You'd know that I was thinkin' of you
And if you coulda touched my love
Then you'd know how I felt for you
You you you
But you never had the time
You never had the time
You didn't have to make me cry
Make me cry
In the middle of my birthday party
And if you never told those lies
Told those lies
There'd be no need for your apologies
If you woulda touched my soul
Then you'd still be a part of me
But you don't know my soul
So now It's just history

[Chorus]
And it's not about
No it's not about you
It's not about you
See I gave you all my love
It was about you
You had your turn
Now it's all about me
Please believe it's all about me

[Verse 2]
Boy you shoulda picked me up
Coulda caught me
When you saw that I was fallin
You never should have been so tough
To answer everytime I was callin'
We couldn't communicate
It was like talkin' to the wall
And now we can't relate
Like I don't know you at all

[Chorus]
That's why it's not about you
No it's not about you
It's not about you
You see I gave you all my love
It was about you
You had your turn
Now it's all about me

[Verse 3]
Everyday it gets more clear
The longer that you're not here
Now I wake up in a different state
And it's written all over my face
No obligations
I'm responsible for me
No interuptions to my liberty
I have found the remedy

[Chorus]
It's only ever supposed to be
All about me
No it's not about you
It's not about you
I thought your love was true
You see I gave you all my love
It was about you
You had your turn
Now it's all about me
Please believe it's all about me
It's not about you
Please believe it's all about me
Please believe it baby please believe it
It was about you
Now it's all about me
