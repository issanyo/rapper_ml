[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
We all got one common goal
Third eye open, never close
I put that on my fucking soul
(I'm telling you)
I know, know, know, know
Said I know, know, know, know
Said I know, know, know, know
Said I know, know, know, know

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Until you die
You got to realize
If you don't try
You'll never know, know, know, know
You'll never know, know, know, know
You'll never know, know, know, know
You'll never know, know, know, know
You'll never know, know, know, know

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
I love it when she Vogue (yeah)
I'm on another dose (hey)
These diamonds on my neck dosey-doe
And the cash blows like snow (ooh)
I float on the track like a kite (kite)
The timing, the timing is right
These niggas, they on thin ice
You can hate with all your might
I'm moving my ceiling mechanic
He don't have no money, so can it
I think I'm a hopeless romantic
Kim Kardashians and many mansions (ooh)

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
We all got one common goal
Third eye open, never close
I put that on my fucking soul
(I'm telling you)
I know, know, know, know
Said I know, know, know, know
Said I know, know, know, know
Said I know, know, know, know
