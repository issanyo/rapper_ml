[Intro]
Told her I can't fall in love now she, damn
She upset, she throwing subs at me

[Chorus]
She used to call me her daddy
Told her I can't fall in love now she, damn
She upset, she throwing subs at me
She just wanna see me unhappy
She used to say, "what's up, daddy"
Now she walk past me with a mug, she keep calling me a dub
Plus she won't stop throwing subs at me
She just wanna see me unhappy

[Verse 1]
But instead I'm in a Lamborghini
With a tint, my windows tinted like I care who see me
If I tell you all my secrets, it won't be a secret
But if I tell you a secret, I hope that you can keep it
Mike Amiri denims, couldn't fit the fucking ratchet
I'm with a shooter, sorry, if he gotta fucking bag niggas
Started calling me the GOAT, I came up from the grass, nigga
I got water on my wrist, I told her look at that river
I wanna act like I don't know you now
My niggas told me I should expose you now
But she used to hold it down
Just hold it down, just hold it down

[Chorus]
She used to call me her daddy
Told her I can't fall in love now she, damn
She upset, she throwing subs at me
She just wanna see me unhappy
She used to say, "what's up, daddy"
Now she walk past me with a mug, she keep calling me a dub
Plus she won't stop throwing subs at me
She just wanna see me unhappy

[Verse 2]
She wanna be my baby, but she can't take it, ah
I only wear this chain for special occasions
I be talking too much money, that's a different language
And I started losing friends when I got famous
If it don't make a dollar, then it don't make sense, amen
I be stuffing hundreds in Melody piggy bank
I'm that nigga, yeah, I wish a nigga would these days
I got rich but I still go back to the hood these days
And honestly
I be tryna stop thinking about you but even when I do
I be reminiscing bad things I did
And I know you hate me, you hate me

[Chorus]
She used to call me her daddy
Told her I can't fall in love now she, damn
She upset, she throwing subs at me
She just wanna see me unhappy
She used to say, "what's up, daddy"
Now she walk past me with a mug, she keep calling me a dub
Plus she won't stop throwing subs at me
She just wanna see me unhappy
