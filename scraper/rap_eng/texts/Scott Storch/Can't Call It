Why I always see you up in the club?
I can't call it
Why niggas be showin you love?
I can't call it
Why you skate in nothin less than dubs?
I can't call it
Yo, what is about you ma?
I can't call it
Why you always got on somethin tight?
I can't call it
Why you only come out at the night?
I can't call it
Why your clothes always so high priced?
I can't call it
Yo, what is about you ma?
I can't call it

[Sticky Fingaz]
I got a big flamethrower, big Range Rover
And when we come to a party you know the thing over
Blaow, shorty seem to just come to us
And wit that bangin ass body you know what we be doin
Word up, air it out, just give it to us
We ain't takin advantage, they said they wanna do it
I gave drunk dick to her
You could ask her later what the Remi did to her
Like yo, when you hit them back four walls
Them back four walls make you collapse on all fours
Backslidin and grindin, furniture gon' fall
Rough sex in the bed, baby we could brawl
Now

Ma, what you got in that denim?
I can't call it
Why you always lookin at women?
I can't call it
Why if niggas ballin you wit 'em?
I can't call it
What is about you ma?
I can't call it
You like your ass better in thongs?
I can't call it
Why you never wearin a bra?
I can't call it
Why I always see you wit stars?
I can't call it
What is about you ma?
I can't call it

[Sticky Fingaz]
I'm lookin at this girl, lookin at my women
It's lookin like she givin us signals to come wit her
Not sayin she dyke but look kinda bully
I'm just sayin some women today prefer women
Ain't nothin changed I'm the same crook
Tryna floss while I'm around get ya chain took
I snatch rocks and when I'm horny I snatch women
While them bitches runnin away I'm just playin wit 'em
I'm eatin you, you givin me head
When I blessed your bed when I spread your legs
While you moanin and groanin I'm hittin that ass
Wifeys, mothers and daughters be strippin for cash
Now
