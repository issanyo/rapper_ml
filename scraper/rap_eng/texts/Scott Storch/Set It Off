[Intro]
Yeah I’m about to set if off
Yeah I’m about to set if off
Yeah I’m about to set if off
Yeah I’m about to set if off

[Verse 1]
Untame on the mic, the dangerous type
And this is real life, it ain’t just the way that I write
We can pour a drink, roll that mary jane up and light
So baby come to Webby’s world, I’ll make you famous tonight
Place your bets y'all gon' pay it in full
Never graduated from school but I made it this cool
Now I’m here motherfucker, ain’t no April fools
Right to the top like I’m defying gravitational pull
Cause I started young but I’m older now
Learned a lot up in the game, got a doper sound
Travelling around the world, getting cultured now
But still rolling with my dogs when I’m homeward bound
When I see Sap at the back of the weed spot
We gon get so fucking high that we pass it to Ewok
Then we turn it up so loud that the back of your seat rocks
From the very second that the beat drops

[Hook]
I’m about to set it off, yo, ready, set, go
If you tryna get it cracking let me know!
I’m about to set it off, whoa, bitches getting low
They be sweating when I be walking through the door
I’m about to set it off

[Verse 2]
Stay writing while rhyming and stage diving
All in, going so hard I could break diamonds
I been patiently waiting but learned that it takes time
And now I got the same look in my eye as a caged lion
I been on my hustle why the fuck you think I’m doing this?
Book of rhymes thicker than a Tarantino movie script
Rolling up a doobie and we jumping in the Uber whip
Until the driver take me to the top, I’m bout to do this shit
So animated, call me Bugs Bunny
Since I used to battle cats for they lunch money
Always had the same clothes, looking duck funny
Straight dummy but Webby was never dumb, buddy
I knew I’d have my moment, so let me soak it in
With your chick and, uh, some of her closest friends
‘Cause they know it now if they didn’t know it then
Now it’s time to let the show begin!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah I’m about to set if off
Yeah I’m about to set if off
Yeah I’m about to set if off
Yeah I’m about to set if off
