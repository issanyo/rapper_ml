[Chorus]
Don't know what it is about you, girl, I can't call it
Tell me what's the biz, we ain't over this, I can't call it
Don't know what it is about you, girl, I can't call it
Tell me what's the biz, we ain't over this, I can't call it

[Verse 1]
Every time that we get together, you be acting
You be acting like it's whatever and I get it cracking
When you leave, you try to change your mind and I don't like it
And I'm almost sick and tired

[Pre-Chorus]
You need to step up to the plate, girl
Come get in the game, girl
Don't say that you can't, girl
Okay? Okay, shut up

[Chorus]
But I don't know what it is about you, girl, I can't call it
I can't call it, baby
Tell me what's the biz, we ain't over this, I can't call it
Don't know what it is but you gotta tell me

[Verse 2]
Not the type to go through all this drama, girl, I ain't with it
You find my baby girl, I'ma, I'ma keep it, keep it
Keep it all the way G and call your game
Because if you don't step up, she'll steal your place

[Pre-Chorus]
You need to step up to the plate, girl
Come get in the game, girl
Don't say that you can't, girl
Okay? Okay, shut up

[Chorus]
But I don't know what it is about you, girl, I can't call it
Can you help me understand, baby?
Tell me what's the biz, we ain't over this, I can't call it
Hey, yeah

[Verse 3]
You look fly, girl, that's no lie
But I ain't like other guys
If you are, then act the fool
Girl, somebody gon' replace you
You look fly, girl, that's no lie
But I ain't like other guys
If you are, then act the fool
Girl, somebody gon' replace you
Don't know what it is, can't call it, girl
See you should've been up and falling, girl
Make your mistakes
You done changed, save it

[Chorus]
And I don't know what it is about you, girl, I can't call it
Tell me what to do about it
Tell me what's the biz, we ain't over this, I can't call it
Oh, hey, hey

[Bridge]
Why you playing? Why you playing?
Get it, get it, get it
Why you playing? Why you playing?
Get it, get it, get it
Why you playing? Why you playing?
Get it, get it, get it
Why you, why you oh
Why you playing? Why you playing?
Get it, get it, get it
Why you playing? Why you playing?
Get it, get it, get it
Why you playing? Why you playing?
Get it, get it, get it
Why you, why you oh

[Chorus]
And I don't know what it is about you, girl, I can't call it
Tell me what's the biz, we ain't over this, I can't call it

[Outro]
Okay, okay, shut up, shut up
Okay, okay, shut up
Okay, shut up, shut up
Okay, okay
