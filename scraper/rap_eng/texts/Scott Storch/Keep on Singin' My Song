[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning with a smile on my face
And nobody's gonna bring me down today
Been feeling like nothing's been going my way lately
But I decided right here, right now
That my outlook's gonna change

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why I'm gonna say goodbye
To all the tears I've cried
For every time somebody hurt my pride
Feelin' like they won't let me live life
And take the time to look at what is mine
I see every blessing so clearly
And I thank God for what I got from above

[Chorus]
I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace from me
They can say all they wanna say about me
But I'm gonna carry on, I'mma keep on singing my song

[Verse 2]
I never wanna dwell on the pain again
There's no use in relivin' how I hurt back then
Rememberin' too well the hell I felt
When I was running out of faith
Every step I'm 'bout to take was towards a better day

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm about to say farewell to every single lie
All the fears I've held too long inside
Every time I felt I couldn't try
All the negativity and strife
For too long I've been strugglin', couldn't go on
But now I've found I'm feelin' strong and I'm moving on

[Chorus]
I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace from me
They can say all they wanna say about me
But I'm gonna carry on
I'll keep on singing my song

[Bridge]
Whoa, every time I tried to be what they wanted from me
It never came naturally so I ended up in misery
Was unable to see all the good around me
Wasting much energy on what they thought of me
Than simply just rememberin' to breathe
I'm humanly unable to please
Everyone at the same time
So now I find my peace of mind living one day at a time
In the end, I answer to one God
Comes down to one love 'til I get to heaven above
I have made the decision, never to give in
'Til the day I die, no matter what
I'm gonna carry on, I'mma keep on singing my song
Lalala la la la la
Lalala la la la la

[Chorus]
I believe they can take anything from me
(I believe)
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace from me
They can do what they wanna, say what they wanna say
They can say what they wanna
But I'm gonna keep on
Keep on singing my song
I believe it
That they can take from me
But they can't take my inner peace
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say what they wanna to say
But I'm gonna sing my song
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
