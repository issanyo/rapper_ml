[Intro]
Said I want to get down tonight
Groove tonight
I'ma let my hair down tonight
Feeling right

[Verse 1]
Fresh out the water then
Straight to the closet its early
(early, Fashionably later)
Never hit the spot early
Chilled wine sip & tell
I’m out the door grab my keys
I'm driving (driving)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not in a hurry
I’m still bending these corners
My system is pumping
My windows they rolled up
My hair keeps on blowing
Its free like the ocean
I caught your attention
Then it had a chain reaction

[Chorus]
Said I wanna get down tonight
Groove tonight
It's on tonight
I'ma put on my heels tonight
Skirt tonight, feeling aight
So you might get lucky tonight
I'm freaky tonight
Groove tonight
It's on tonight

[Hook]
I like it I love it
This DJ got it jumpin'
I like it I love it
I ain't to be trusted

[Verse 2]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Refrain]
Headed to the floor to meet me another one
Spend another one
Spend another one
It's on tonight

[Chorus x2]
