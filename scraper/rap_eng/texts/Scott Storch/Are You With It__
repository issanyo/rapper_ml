[Full lyrics available upon release of the song]

Uh, are you looking at me?
'Cause I'm looking at you
Do what you gotta do
What you gotta do
[?]

So here I am [?]
[?] it's all up to you
So here's your chance
Better make that move
See baby, it's now or never
It's all up to you, aha

It could be that [?] never make up
[?] never give up
I don't care who's [?] watching
'Cause I don't give a fuck
You're [?] my baby, uh
Ah, ah, ah
Are you with it?

Do I turn you on?
I think I do
So come and get it
