[Intro: Kelly Rowland]
This ain't gon' be easy (Work)
Uh
You got it, you got it
Put it in (Work)

[Verse 1: Kelly Rowland]
Tables turned into a situation
Now you standing in my face and you been patiently waiting
Fumbling over words, forget the conversation
Thinking maybe we could make the combination
Wanna see me lose my breathe, want to hear me moan
Better be ready, will and able when we get along
You was talking tough up on in the telephone
So you better put it in when we get it on

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
No turning back from this party
Put you through enough to come play (hey)
Ain't no coming down from this high
My love don't go nowhere 'less I say
Look at what you got yourself into
Best take advantage, be all that you can be
Best take advantage, see all that you can see
Cause this could be a less opportunity that won't be

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Put it in
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby get it (put it in)
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby get it (go hard)
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby get it
Don't come around, keep on letting me down
You got to get it all the way in, I want to see you work

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
Now you looking like you looking for an explanation
Is the curves on my body for you motivation?
Skip the petty needs, No time for complication
Use both hands to make sure I reach my destination
Better leave a good impression 'fore you hit the dough
Cause you don't want me talking about your business on the low
You show it off, I had to fit you in my schedule
So you better put it on me when It is time to go

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
No turning back from this party
Put you through enough to come play (hey)
And ain't no coming down from this high
My love don't go nowhere 'less I say

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Put it in
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby get it (put it in)
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby get it (go hard)
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby get it
Do not come around, keep on letting me down
You got to get it all the way in, I want to see you work

[Bridge: Kelly Rowland]
I ain't excepting no excuses baby (no)
Don't brag about it if you useless baby (no)
You better blow me away, make a girl want to stay
At your spot for another round
It's your chance to prove, don't forget your moves
There's nothing to lose, but me

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Put it in
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby get it (put it in)
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby get it (go hard)
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby get it
Do not come around, keep on letting me down
You got to get it all the way in, I want to see you work
Put it in
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby get it (put it in)
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby get it (go hard)
Check it baby, get it baby, check it baby, get it (work)
Do it baby, do-do it baby get it
Do not come around, keep on letting me down
You got to get it all the way in, I want to see you work
