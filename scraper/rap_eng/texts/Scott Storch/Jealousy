[Verse 1]
I thought you were my best friend
I thought we'd be together till the end
You're not the girl I once knew
Tell me were she is, 'cause she's not you
You used to be that shoulder
That shoulder I could lean on through it all
But now it's getting colder
There's no love between these walls

[Chorus]
Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Is such an evil thing to watch someone have
Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Nobody wins, when you're full of envy

[Post-Chorus]
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 2]
I was always happy when I was watching you become a star
But you were only happy when the world was opening up my scars
And now I'm like the devil
Well if I am, then what does that make you?
You sold yourself for your fame
You'll still never walk a day in my shoes

[Chorus]
Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Is such an evil thing to watch someone have
Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Nobody wins, when you're full of envy

[Post-Chorus]
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Bridge (Spoken)]
I only wanted what was best for you
Everything I did, I did because I cared
So how did all the good between us turn so bad?
Maybe someday we'll get back, what we had

[Chorus]
Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Is such an evil thing to watch someone have
Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Is such an evil thing to watch someone have
Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Is such an evil thing to watch someone have
Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy (jealousy)
Nobody wins, when you're full of envy

[Post-Chorus]
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
