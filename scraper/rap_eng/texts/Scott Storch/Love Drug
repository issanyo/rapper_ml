Dope

You got me hooked, I got you sprung
Now add that up and you're my love drug
I'm your love drug
You're what I need and I'm your pusher man

You appear as though you're from Columbia
You keep it tight for me like zip locks
And I just got high when we lip lock
And you just got high when we lip lock

So you search for me
With a flashlight in the daylight
'Cause I'm your get right
So no one serves you up, girl, like I can
I'm your Mr. Midnight pusher man

My weakness, see I)
And I can't kick it

(I gotta have you)
You got me so addicted
(You got me so addicted, yea)
See, you're my drug
(My, my, my love drug)

See my urge gets fulfilled when you come through
I love every little bit of ounce of you
See you're back for more and I'm reeing up
You're floating now that's that good stuff

And that's all day
(I'm stone, she's stone)
And all night
(We bang, we bone)
Now hurry back soon when I'm in demand
'Cause I'm your pusher man

I'm your drug
(I'm your drug, yea, sky high, sky high)
And you can't kick
(Ooh, you can't kick it)

She can't, she can't
(Gimme up, gimme up)

She keeps me feening

And turned on
(Got me lost and turned on)
