[Chorus: Who Is Gavin]
We've been talking for a while
Why are you still talking boo?
We should just go split up or something
You do not need me, getting ridding of you
We keep talking over miles
Do I even want you?
No I don't, so turn around
Babe, I'm getting rid of you
Girl, I'm getting rid of you
Babe, I'm getting rid of you
I can't stand the sight of you
I want you, but I cannot do
I can't stand the sight of you, I
I can't stand the sight of you
I can't stand the, sight
The, sight of you
I can't

[Verse 1: Who Is Gavin]
I gotta get rid of you right now
I know that it sounds bad, but
It's really not bad, not bad bruh
We keep on our heads, no bad stuff
Babe, you was my baby day 1
I don't even think that we should even say something
You been on my mind for a minute
But you don't even want me, what's the point and
Trying to say that you want me but
You don't wanna get me and that's okay
Cause you treated me bad the first 4 times
And I ain't gonna say nothing, but that's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

[Chorus: Who Is Gavin]
We've been talking for a while
Why are you still talking boo?
We should just go split up or something
You do not need me, getting ridding of you
We keep talking over miles
Do I even want you?
No I don't, so turn around
Babe, I'm getting rid of you
Girl, I'm getting rid of you
Babe, I'm getting rid of you
I can't stand the sight of you
I want you, but I cannot do
I can't stand the sight of you, I
I can't stand the sight of you
I can't stand the, sight
The, sight of you
I can't

[Outro: Who Is Gavin]
We've been talking for a while
Why are you still talking boo?
We should just go split up or something
You do not need me, getting ridding of you
We keep talking over miles
Do I even want you?
No I don't, so turn around
Babe, I'm getting rid of you
Girl, I'm getting rid of you
Babe, I'm getting rid of you
I can't stand the sight of you
I want you, but I cannot do
I can't stand the sight of you, I
I can't stand the sight of you
I can't stand the, sight
The, sight of you
I can't
