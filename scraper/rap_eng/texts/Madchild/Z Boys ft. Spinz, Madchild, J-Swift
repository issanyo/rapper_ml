[Verse 1: Spinz]

They tryin to tell me I just hang up my axes
These the same ones that carry purses
Wear make up and dresses
This generations messed up
And I ain't impressed
My tears drop drip
Like raindrops beats
To verses I sketch
These so called leaders
That you follow on instagram
Follow the same people
That follow the clan
That followed a man
That takes mothers
And deports em'
Probably be the same man
That burned California
Bet you'll find a little truth
In the words of the author
When it comes to family
And talent
That's two things
I'd never squander
Partners we split the pot up
Started with just a pot plant
Pop lockin on corners
The same corner they shot Tiny Bam at
RIP
Spinz all about that real facts
Soap box and a backpack
Strapped with ancient knowledge
Sound mind and a mean rap
I just kick facts like soccer balls at the World Cup
Won't be the last rapper that screams
Impeach Trump
I'm a legend
I'm a GOAT
I was born in 77'
Never met my birth parents
I was a gift straight from heaven
To the streets that developed him
To teach him to never settle in
I'm a warrior of light
In the Battleaxe regimen





[Verse 2: MadChild]

They're trying to tell me
There's a reason I should switch
Back to being single
It's the season of the witch
Ripping through these tracks
Like I got drag pipes
Back to being the dopest
Spitting crack without the glass pipe
Did some crazy shit
But also had some wild times
Feast on a spread
Wild beast with a child's mind
Tried relationships
But I ain't getting bogged down
I'm an OG like Z Boys
From Dogtown
I'm Bap Moses plague you with mass locusts
End you I'm that focused
Send you some black roses
Make some changes
If you want to feel the pain stop
We rose from rappers
Me and Doh-Ski and RayneDrop
Canada's the mother land
But guess that I'm the wildest horse
Lately I've been noticing
That I ain't getting child support
Glorifying rats
The harshest weakness
I will go to my grave
With my darkest secrets
Now I'm gliding over rappers
Like I'm parasailing
Terror raises
With my very scary para phrases
You don't like my shit
You got a problem hearing well
Go back to Enterprise
With just a bumper
And a steering wheel

[Verse 3: J-Swift]

I'm making mines over breaks
While you wasting time
On the scene since seventeen
Back in eighty nine
Plotting schemes over break beats
And drum machines
By twenty one I won
It's never done the dream
It's too much fun so nigga
Yall don't fuck with me
The kingdom is in my mind
I'm living comfortably
If you ain't rushin
I'm interrupting with cutlery
I burn all kinds of fuel
I don't just fuck with trees
Black, whites, el mexicans and Tuscanees
I kill at will like Ice Cube
You better run from me
J-Swift's the brand Fathouse the company
I keep a bag full of cash
And bag of potpourri


[Verse 4: Doh-Ski]

It's gonna sound as crazy as it did to me
No reality check is too basic
I overcame a cocaine addiction
To become semi-famous
They say success is sweet
I'm just too busy to taste it
Honestly let's face it
I know I'm gonna make it
It's just a matter of time
Finally put down the lines
Now I'm up in this game of mine
Stage presence may get from God
His presents
Ya I'm good at a couple things
I just love the feeling music brings
Ring tone ring tone ring
I'm a champion who won't wake up
Try slapping him
Another overdose
A couple days of comotose
Shit get's to my head to easily
Drugs were freezing the feelings I felt
Now I got the game
Under my belt
