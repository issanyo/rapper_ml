[Verse 1: Mad Child]
White python, night-lights on
Mike Tyson, I'm white lighting
Complete freak on the beat by Viking
Black heat, enemies don't like 'em
Keep on fighting, keep reciting
Writing; he will defeat these titans
Speak like a king, live like a pirate
Move like a gypsy, cause small riots
Not tall giant, also flying
No joke no matter how broke I am
Don't go crying, won't start lying
City's a jungle, still I'm a lion
Feel good as I am without doing dope
Mad Child clean like mouth full of soap
No doubt not out with the bros
Just stay above water like house is a boat
Small blue pills thousands of those
Back that's a place that I'll never go
Difficult centrifugal force
Or the simplest flows like wind through the door

[Verse 2: Prevail]
You killed that shit man
Warriors for life dig up the swollen army
Shout to my young brother Trey Nice
I'm about to get him out of this high-tempo BPM shit
Rob the Viking live from the estuary. P1
S&M. What's up? Come on Rob, let's get 'em

Oil spill top kill fills at the mortuary
My life a wild life I'm live from the estuary
S.O. shell BPR VIP I kill like military
Spilling red liquid everywhere just like a bloody mary
Bloody like the movie Carrie, wise man mother Mary
Secret symbolism come across like the Maltese
Battle-axe warriors I'm tattooed like a Maori
Hear my war cry, I paralyze it so powerfully
And how can he do what I can't, rocking it like Element
Show me attitude and you'll get branded like a cattle ranch
Man you spitting garbage bitch, I'm like a Harvard graduate
Conception is immaculate, back from the dead like Lazarus
Novel is protagonist, * and vice and avarice
Dropping from my speech each and every letter of alphabet
Genetic spikes precisely accurate like laws of Calculus
Vocal like Ted Noble so fucking with me is hazardous
Ferris wheel, carousel, kerosene, everything
Burn down the carnival, very strange penny lane
Beatles Rolling Stones Pink Floyd
Black light acid trips sink into the void oh boy

[Mad Child]
I'm done, I'm tired of being a pawn on the chess board
War comes got straps and a vest for it
Fuck pills, fuck coke, fuck escorts
Fuck being a gangster and fuck being dead for it

[Prevail]
White gold crushed chrome powdered aluminum
Old school trains, hop the bottom, rustoleum
Yeah, my name's Prevail I'm on your trail like Ho Chi Minh
Dude I'm too crude highly flammable petroleum

It's the sound of the drum coming at you like a heart
Hit you in the face with the bass booming in the car
It's the sound of the drum, you can run but you won't get far

[Verse 3: Mad Child]
Creator of this abstract dark art poetic style
Mad Child saying that bull will be pathetic pal
Least I didn't forget it beast still deeply embedded
This MC from BC still deeply regretting now
I lost concentration and focus on what was important
Must have been the pills and all the coke I was snorting
Now I'm telling all my folks that I'm sober and it's over
But I know that if you put it to my nose I still could go for it
That's why I keep reminding myself and going over it
It's very dramatic to date a heroin addict
Had a bad relationship, good girl but wanted out like I was seeing ghosts
And hearing voices in a haunted house, I'm known for fucking up
And acting stupid and erratic
I get fully loaded like the bullets slipped into the clip
And clicked into the pistol grips of semi automatics
I was a terrible addict but the kids back at it

It's the sound of the drum coming at you like a heart
Hit you in the face with the bass booming in the car
It's the sound of the drum, you can run but you won't get far
(I wanna rock right now)
