[Intro]
"The first creature on earth bullets cannot kill, The Blood Beast"
Yeah, ok, yo, yeah

[Verse 1]
Look, I’m a beast, I’m a vet, I’m a stone cold survivor
Got so many stripes, man, I look like a tiger
I pulled so many rappers’ cards, call me Hallmark
Racks, I got stacks, I am racked up like Walmart
Man I’m disgusting like old chunky yogurt
I’m old but I’m still fucking cool, Humphrey Bogart
Crash course kids, seatbelts and roll bars
Breaking into beats like I am carrying a crowbar
Five gold stars. I’m a terminator
Determined, not a German, permanent exterminator
24 bars, that’s a baker’s dozen
I am bad man like getting naked with your cousins
Brand you can trust, I’m dependable too
I’m getting old but still a killer boy, Expendables 2
Don’t mean to hurt your feelings boy but I will
Cuz I'm on top again and you can’t even get to the hill
Yeah, super beast, I'm an immortal, let me demonstrate
My skin is bulletproof impossible to penetrate
An animal that stands lateral without collateral
My personalities are multiple but they’re compatible

[Hook]
I can make an album in a week
Still be flyer than a motherfucking falcon with a beak
Let me do a show, I guarantee I'll pack ‘em in their seats
Cus I’m a fucking super beast, my homies back me in the street
Yo, I'm not a lil’ bitch, I'm not a bastard or a thief
I pray to god at night and thank him for my life, that’s my belief
I'm ok as long as all the bills are paid and I am dry
Got a little whip that cracks, my clothes are fresh, my girl is fly, fly, fly

[Verse 2]
I’ll race you, fuck, boy, that’s that shit I don’t like
You talking shit because my skin color is bone white
2 A.M. I am rapping on a cold mic
Just because I’m barking please do not think that I don’t bite
I’m a complex bomb threat
Little King Kong, I’m a broken Vietnam vet
My story dark so I go deeper than a tar pit
Put you in a chokehold, your nose is in my armpit
Nighty night, go to sleep from my Jiu jitsu
It's dark and I’m a shark, this is my turf and you are fish food
Sick and deranged cannibal, twisted and strange animal
I an insane man and my vision’s to rain cannonballs
I’m the last emperor in the Forbidden City
I will take over the planet when I’m good and ready
Deranged orphan, I’m sick of all the horse shit
Hire me for a verse and I will murder you on your shit

[Hook]
I can make an album in a week
Still be flyer than a motherfucking falcon with a beak
Let me do a show, I guarantee I'll pack ‘em in their seats
Cus I’m a fucking super beast, my homies back me in the street
Yo, I'm not a lil’ bitch, I'm not a bastard or a thief
I pray to god at night and thank him for my life, that’s my belief
I'm ok as long as all the bills are paid and I am dry
Got a little whip that cracks, my clothes are fresh, my girl is fly, fly, fly
