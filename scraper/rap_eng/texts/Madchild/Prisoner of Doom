Partial Chorus:

Sittin' in your room.. you listen and consume
You're a prisoner of doom
Sittin' in my room.. I listen and consume
I'm a prisoner of doom

Verse 1: (Madchild)

Star issue
Scar tissue
I wish you would die, I'll miss you
Sittin' in the chair while I'm starin' into space
Rippin' out my hair, while I'm tearin' at my face
Shane's brain chemistry maintains supremacy
Arctic tribe leader, go, visual effect
Brainwash bang like a bad hangover
Rock every show I can, but I can't sober
Sworn secrecy, view porn frequently
Lines in the bathroom? Please don't speak with me
Why am I insulted? I'm the high exalted
Culprit
Product more potent and open
Mad represent leopard skin, snake skin, black leather
Suicide rate high, bad weather
Please feast on a piece of perfection
Seek inner peace, we just need some direction

Full Chorus:

Sittin' in your room.. you listen and consume
You're a prisoner of doom
Sittin' in your room.. you listen and consume
You're a prisoner of doom
Visions realize, this is real life
Do you see the light?
I just feel like..
Sittin' in my room.. I listen and consume
I'm a prisoner of doom

Verse 2: (Prevail)

This is not for the faint of heart
Break apart from the heavy turbulence
Disturbing images, burning in your mind for my encouragement
Permanent deep scars
Extremely sharpened instruments
Courage is necessary
Survival in this tournament
Tomorrow's a new day
Post cataclysmic
Akira
Neo-Tokyo, but slightly different
Flashing bright neon signs
Battle axe imprint
The chosen are few, but the gratification is instant
Cities of the future
Strength is encouraged, embraced
Lonely, lack of faith
Face the malnourished with hate
Secret code
Warrior's conduct
Natural concept, help your brother in conflict
Predatory instincts, drink from the victor's chalice
Find the chink in your chainmail, to rebalance your palette
What makes matters worse, my camp thirsts for the conquest
Amplified, purified, horrified, content

Partial Chorus:

Sittin' in your room.. you listen and consume
You're a prisoner of doom
Sittin' in your room.. you listen and consume
You're a prisoner of doom

Verse 3: (Madchild and Prevail switch off)

(Madchild)
Experiment with nature's offerings, not Satan's offspring
I'll still make a profit, we will take no losses
Deep breath, go get it
Dirt bike, snowboard, surf, hike, go sleddin'
Explore northern forest, race through desert
Final destination.. make place in heaven
No heart full of fear.. not face full of hatred
Friendship is sacred, life isn't wasted

(Prevail)
That's why we embrace it
The sky's not vacant
Neither is the sub-level
Heavy colored gunmetal
Riders on the storm, devil daggers in the sheath
Human form is exceptional, the tragedy is brief
Each breath like a hologram, projected from my lung
Every animal's the same because we all protect our young
Believe in something beautiful
The music is our destiny
Why live in complacency when you can leave a legacy?

Full Chorus:

Sittin' in your room.. you listen and consume
You're a prisoner of doom
Sittin' in your room.. you listen and consume
You're a prisoner of doom
Visions realize, this is real life
Do you see the light?
I just feel like..
Sittin' in my room.. I listen and consume
I'm a prisoner of doom
