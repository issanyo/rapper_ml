[Hook: MadChild]
How did this get outta control (outta control)
I gotta learn how to leave it alone (leave it alone)
How did these pills get control of my life
They got a hold of my life, I need control of my life back

[Hook: MadChild]
10's, 20's, 40's, 80's
MadChild popping more pills than Slim Shady
Cash, cars, strippers, models
Traded all of that for little pills in a bottle
Oxys, Percocet, Vicodin, Somas
Doesn't really matter long as I am in a coma
My family and my friends say enough is enough
This is MadChild's life and I'm fucking it up

[Verse 1: MadChild]
Constipated, only shit when I'm concentrated
MadChild try to catch me and I'm constant faded
The promoter's happy if the little monster made it
Known for skipping shows but known for ripping flows
Was known for stacking gwap, rocking shows and hitting hoes
Now waking up to pay the bill is fucking difficult
I'm watching porno but my dick ain't hard
People look at me like who the fuck is this retard
All I do is watch movies, stoned alone on my couch
I'm passed out with a lit cigarette in my mouth
I got cigarette holes on my couch, on my clothes
Cigarette burns in my house on the floor
Doing a head nod pushing my whip through the streets
But it's not to the beat its cause I'm falling asleep
I got a monkey on my back dog enough is enough
Cause this is MadChild's life and I'm fucking it up

[Verse 2: MadChild]
Had myself an intervention, dragged my ass to rehab
Love God but prayed so much I should have bought kneepads
There's too many rules to follow that shit was making me mad
Sit and talk to strangers and I listen to feedback
Hi! My name is MadChild...my aim is...
Quit drugs, go back to being drunk and famous
20 days later I was back on the plane
25 days later back at it again
I was back in outer space like an astronaut
With a box of cracker jacks and an astropop
Popping pills like candy, so much candy
My tummy looking like the late John Candy
My girl get mad cause I don't get randy
That's about the time Viagra come in handy
Aw man, come on dog enough is enough
This is MadChild's life and I'm fucking it up
