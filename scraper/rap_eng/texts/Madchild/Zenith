[Verse 1] Prevail

I'm Prevail Wonder from the Neural Bombing Agency
We control the watch tower now
Power of assembly in crowds, hypnosis
The only closest pattern to our process
Our signature of razor blades and vinegar
Walkin' in the path of the workin' class is a fuckin' blast
And in our union, no reunion without hard hats
This is the work place of jackhammers, sledgehammers, and mallots
Packin' a mic in our arean, leads to many maggots
Too many heavy magnets pullin' you closer in
The territory of the desert of the cobra pen
I gotta give a shout-out to my brother Orco "the psychotic" alien
Who stamped our preformance, who speaks like reverent poets
Opposin' the possibility of lots of endurance
Isn't it my precious beheaded Elizabeth
A vision of the greatest thing you've seen since your Christening
I'm listening to children, speak of the matrix
Battling the bubonic spread of the primal hatred

[Verse 2] Madchild

Madchild, rock steady representative
A combination of creative energy and tentative
Precentages, take advantages, manage to increase
Cause damage then vanish into thin air, Rest In Peace
Not to be tested, possesed, invest in me
I'll fight with my last breathe til there's nothing left in me
I'll smash on all sorts with these extreme sports
Prophets of doom consumed with what I dream for
Subtle as a chainsaw, blood shed and rain fall
Welcome to the side of my brain that entertain's y'all
Feel my wrath, you couldn't recover from the other half
Behind the shower curtain stabbin' bitches in a bubble bath
(Ahhh) I'll make you an offer you can't refuse
Then leave a horses head in your bed, I'm bad news
Don't question my authority cuz It's a mistake
There's madness in a whisper like the hiss of a snake
You got the first album Balance
Thank you. This might take you back
