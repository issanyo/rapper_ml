[Verse 1] Prevail
It's the reanimated alpha of Anno Domini
The illumini alumni
I will be burned as the skyline turns auburn
Skeletal piratical, navigators with nautical, multi-directional
Uncharitable armadas, amulets of bravado
Summon anacondas and barracudas
Table-spreads full of ambrosia and avocados
Avant-garde models, from alchemists with Bunsen Burners and Pyrex bottles
Aqua regia stored away, like holy water and catholic fathers

[Verse 2] Madchild
Humanity for infinity, vanity in the vicinity
That's a party of cardiovascular masculinity
Kings collaborate as I elaborate
Your scared stiff, sweating profusely
Technique flows loosely like Bruce Lee against one hundred wondering
Step up next and see
I'm siphoning spirits increasing child's life expectancy
Oral engagements lead to floral arrangements of small tasks to crack masks of two-faced trolls
Taste the forbidden fruit and get tortured in an orchard
Switch and feel hella pain stretched and sealed with cellophane
Death trap wrapped in captivity, malevolent density
Intelligent relevant elegance and high-voltage intensity
Watching castles collapse, perhaps you wave a white flag
Terrorizing townships, hallucinogenic down-trips
Crystal vision is blurry, dredge the judge and the jury of a horrified hostage
I'll bury your head like an ostrich

[Verse 3] Prevail
I'm chief Cock of the Walk, with the authority to shut down any circus, that operates on less than three watts
I'm sure your pleased as punch to be drinking Prevail pekoe
Grab your lunch and your road map, It's Vancouver's swankiest wacko
There's no character of virago in the board game for a fellow
I commanded and demand the respect of a concerto
You can tell I've arrived, by the violent vibrations of a violin, and the banshee bellow of a live cello
The mic is my cross, I shoot up shit like Macross
None of my words get crossed, fort down into a cross
