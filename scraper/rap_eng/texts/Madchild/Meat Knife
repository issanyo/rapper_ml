[Intro]
The best kept secret
Yo
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm spittin' five foot fireballs
I'm a road dog, ride 'till my tires bald
Little monster, I'm a beautiful mess
I am crazy and depressed, that's my key to success
You can catch me spittin' lightning while I'm beating my chest
I'm so good, it's fuckin' frightening, I am leading the rest
I'm the opposite of mediocre, you're bleeding joker
I'm so hungry, crunching rappers like a greedy ogre
Your skeleton is gelatin
Fly like Dumbo the elephant, to relevant
I'm an old relic, spittin' icy cold pellets
You're underdeveloped, I'm a thunderess relic
A wonderful felon, hundreds of hungry men yellin'
My lyrics trip you out like a hallucinogenic
Walls turn to liquid, I'm a gruesome lieutenant
Stole my girls heart, I'm an proper thief
But I'm a fucking freak show like Chopper Read
I make psychopathic records
Check my psychiatric records
I attack a type of beat like I'm a hyperactive wrestler
Dawg, I'm spooky, I'm kookie, I'm loopy
White teeth, black touqe, lookin' like Snoopy
Knock a girl out like she just took a roofie
Call your crew out, 'cause your whole crew's goofy
(Bitch)
...I'm spooky!

[Hook]
I am mystifying, leave her mystified
'Cause I turn into a beast, like Mr. Hyde
Madchild rocks, I'm electrifying
Said I rock motherfucker, leave you petrified
Madchild's back, motherfuck, that's what's up
BattleAxe tracks get massacred
I said I'm back, that's what's up
BattleAxe tracks get massacred
C'mon

[Verse 2]
Shit gets weird
I'm about to shave my head like Britney Spears
I'm about to lose my shit. like Britney Spears
Growing long finger nails and a grizzly beard
On a real dope beat, I'm a grizzly bear
And I walk down the streets, and the kids just stare
But I no big deal, I'm a speck of sand
But my family is huge like a Mexican
I am fierce, I am brash, I am totally vicious
A real fucking dick, I'll explode on you bitches
It's hard to stay fresh when I feel so fucking sour
And I don't have the cash, I don't have the fucking power
Used to think that I was special, a pretty big deal
Ugly now but I remember how the pretty kids feel
Five years of drugs, twenty years of drinking
Twenty years of smoking, what the fuck was I thinking?

[Hook]
I am mystifying, leave her mystified
'Cause I turn into a beast, like Mr. Hyde
Madchild rocks, I'm electrifying
Said I rock motherfucker, leave you petrified
Madchild's back, motherfuck, that's what's up
BattleAxe tracks get master cut
I said I'm back, that's what's up
BattleAxe tracks get massacre
C'mon
