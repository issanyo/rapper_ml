[Intro: Mad Child]
This is Dagger Mouth. Swollen Members
This is Mad Child
We're stripping it down. Going back to basics
We're keeping it classic now, fuck all that bullshit
Real hip-hop. It's 12:30 AM
I'm drinking Red Bull right now
That's how we do it

[Verse 1: Mad Child]
Yo I'm losing my mind, spinning out of control
People think that I'm an animal as far as it go
Used to be the fucking star of the show
20, 000 getting crazier the harder we go
With my partner Peter Parker I was jumping like a trampoline
Web spinning Spiderman swinging from the scaffolding
Ain't no feeling like stage diving
Jumping over barricades, mad human hurricane
Beats by Viking, go, greased lightning
Life's so frightening, there's no rewriting it
And I'm insane and my name's Shane
And I like pills and doing cocaine
Shane found new friends and filled this anguish
Shane gotta find another way to deal with pain
Shane gotta find another way to deal with shame
Shane gotta find another way to deal with Shane

[Hook: Mad Child]
Hey, yo-
Crowd surfing, stage diving
Life's perfect, keep thriving
Sick serpents in my circus
Keep feeding 'til I'm worthless
Now I'm nervous, hand shaking
Sense fakeness, my heart's breaking
Tense faking, can't take it
It's too late, you met Satan

[Hook: Prevail]
You make friends with the Devil
You have fun with the Devil
You make vows with the Devil
Now who you think gonna win?
You make love to the Devil
You have fun with the Devil
You win fights with the Devil
You get right with the Devil
Now who you think gonna win?

[Verse 2: Prevail]
Hey yo mic like a megaphone, live from the danger zone
Overdrive saber-tooth tiger writing crazy poems
Plated chrome Shure 57s, no cords
Sky dive and record, record and then win an award
Man overboard, the water is cold and filled with predators
Who outcasted both of my team just like a Senator
Competitors I'm chopping up their heads like some lettuces
Iceberg words Judge Dredd death sentences
Partner is a venomous Dennis the Menace
Nemesis running for shelter, Sharon Tate, Helter Skelter
Delta force airfoce four course live show
Bring your appetite cause we can feed you till you're full
Pull people from the floor to the stage beside us
Once a spectator now a top rated stage diver
On a combat cause a highly trained cage fighter
Space face, Silver Surfer, Peter Parker, black spider, yeah

[Hook: Prevail]
Crowd surfing, freestyling
Loud music, keep driving
Short circuit, we overworked it
Keep speeding, the road is perfect
Now I'm swerving, hands shaking
Sense danger, my heart's racing
Engine breaking, I can't take it
It's too late, you met Satan

[Hook: Mad Child]
You make friends with the Devil
You have fun with the Devil
You make vows with the Devil
Now who you think gonna win?
You make love to the Devil
You have fun with the Devil
You win fights with the Devil
You get right with the Devil
Now who you think gonna win?

[Verse 3: Mad Child]
I can hear the crowd screaming, green eyes gleaming
Staring at the corner at a winged horned demon
He look angry, energy is gnarly
Smoke coming out of his nose he start snarling
Everything was peace Bob Marley
He's on his sixteenth can, hops and barley
Cops make it quite clear they don't like him
Try to instil fear, I'm not frightened
That's a bad look, the wrong angle
My ego's outta control, you'll get mangled
That's the trap that he wants me in
That's the trap and he'll feed from my greed and sin

[Outro: Mad Child]
Nobody's going to back me into a corner, man
I'll pick my own fucking lawyers
I'll pick my own manager
I'll pick my own fucking friends, man
I got a problem with authority
Nobody tells me what to do
Watch me fuck my whole fucking life up
