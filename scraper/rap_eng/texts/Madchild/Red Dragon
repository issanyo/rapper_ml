[Verse One] [Moka Only]
From the lungs of an original member
Savagest traveler
Pick my teeth with the bones of cadavers
Ravage and magic there's rap in your cabbage
Swing with Battle Axe cause I can't stay average
Roll with the maverick who moves spider-matic
Down with the ice vein, angel misguided
The phantom in your cabinet of lies
Why can't they fathom the pattern of the skies
It's dark when I wake light falls when I sleep
Fright comes off me when I walk in the street
Embark on my feat of neuroscience's discoveries
Acid on your brain makes the holes seem lovely
And you thought I couldn't rock this way?
You thought wrong, partner; my thought displays
The most caustic array that I bring when I choose it
Fuck when you wanna see me use it
Red Dragon

[Scratch Hook]:
Red dragon
I'm the leader
(i'm one of the best)

[Verse Two] [Mad Child]:
Mad Child, I'm unbeatable, fucking unbelievable
See a guy that I don't fucking like and let the heater go
See a couple haters, later they don't wanna see me though
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, drop the Glock, cock it slow
Keep your mouth shut, I'll go off, you're gonna pay for it
Shoot your house up then ride off on a skateboard
I don't really need a bitch, bitch you should see the clique
Leader of this shit, you should quit, work at Pita Pit
I am so competed, I am needed, I am the leader, trick
Mad Child's back, don't trip bitch, eat a dick
Never talk to the cops, always plead the fifth
Hard rock, look at him like "Dog, I don't need this shit"
I tag and I blast strapped up with a magnum
Tattooed up, Gucci jeans still sagging
All these little hipsters dressed in pink look like faggots
I stay dressed in black and I'm still a motherfucking red dragon

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three] [Prevail]
Seven three seven, Prev One's a legend
Twist up my two fingers, represent red dragon
You hear my go rawr like a dungeon dragon
Now change your little drawers cause your pants are shitty
We the skateboard overloads, kings of the city
Rock my deck RDS and my trucks stay Indy
Pendant lieutenant, the black Tony Bennett
Respect, I get it, you'd better get a medic (Why?)
Or maybe anesthetic cause you rappers looking diabetic
Mine is ath-e-letic, X games, quarter pipe shit
Talking all this shit, bitch you can't even kick flip
Balance like a Chinese symbol, my lyrics liquid
What? You thought I couldn't rock this way?
You thought wrong, partner, my thoughts display
Cause this cosmic array that I play in my music
You're fucked if I ever have to use it
