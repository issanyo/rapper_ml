[Intro]
Yeah
Aye
Superbeast

[Verse 1]
Madchild, I am hot like I'm in Mazatlan
Got tricks up my sleeve, I'm the magic man
My mind's elaborate, could crumble like an avalanche
I put a rapper to sleep like he took clonazepam
We'll build a commune in cabin's like a savage clan
I'll take a knife and slice your cheek off like a slab of ham
My life was dark like I didn't even have a soul
Abracadabra, pulled myself out of the rabbit hole
People comin' to my crib, chillin' really scared
Art, Bearbricks, Kaws companions, Herman Miller chairs
From art to furniture, apartments like a museum
At rap I'm ill, but I'm retarded as a human being
Dumb shit, no wonder people think I'm smokin' cocoa puffs
Look at all the pics I posted up, a broken coconut
I lost my marbles not playin' with a full deck
I'm missin' pieces to this puzzle, not a full set
Juggernaut the ground it shakes, you hear my loud stomps
Fuck smoking, I am vaping, I'm at cloud comps
This is my house, built by bricks of accolades
I keep my shit together while these other dudes dilapidate

[Hook]
Madchild, glory days to a gory face
To horror, war and rage rage
Rich to being poor and strange
Horrid pain, and I went to make my story change
Exciting chapter, had to change it from a boring page
I moved to Cali like a foreign exchange
I love Van but it's always fucking pouring with rain
For a second actually thought that I was going insane
I figured out I'm never letting life get boring again

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I pack a blade that's big enough to still decapitate
The wind from in me killing everybody like The Happening
Don't act afraid to tear shit up, black tornado
Rippin' whippin' shit up, making mashed potatoes
Mad's agitated, it's too late, it's your fault
You spittin' bars? I am spittin' aggravated assault
Yeah, underground king, I'm the northerners warlord
Invented mixing hip-hop with dragons and folklore
Superbeast, I'm made of steel. This dork is made of cork board
When I see these losers eye to eye, that's what this fork's for
Lemons into lemonade. Watch a psycho demonstrate
Penetrate a rapper's brain and make 'em hyperventilate
I am trying to be a secret, still the best kept
Idol to these suicidal psychopaths with death threats
I guess they like me 'cause I say whatever's on my mind
This little devil has a different level of design

[Hook]
Madchild, glory days to a gory face
To horror, war and rage
Rich to being poor and strange
Horrid pain, and I went to make my story change
Exciting chapter, had to change it from a boring page
I moved to Cali like a foreign exchange
Love Van but it's always fucking pouring with rain
For a second actually thought that I was going insane
I figured out I'm never letting life get boring again

[Verse 3]
Sitting 'round and doing nothing is a bad idea
Now I'm busy working all the time, I'm glad I'm here
Suffering from depression and I couldn't get the pain out
Actually started having thoughts of blowing my fucking brains out
This is way before the battles on tracks
I started praying again to God. He help me find my way back
My self against in KOTD, it isn't that fair
How's a squid gonna wrestle with a grizzly bear?
This kid's something, it's fun and games at playing patty cake
I'll bake your head and cut it up and put it on a salad plate
And serve it on a silver platter, scatter I'm a rattlesnake
Tattletales, watch 'em all skedaddle from this bad mistake
'Cause Mad's awake laughing like inhaling nitrous oxide
I'm here to crush your fucking dreams like I'm a rock slide
Blonde haired, bomb scare when I use blonde peroxide
And still I'm the fucking king rooster of this cockfight

[Hook]
Madchild, glory days to a gory face
To horror, war and rage rage
Rich to being poor and strange
Horrid pain, and I went to make my story change
Exciting chapter, had to change it from a boring page
I moved to Cali like a foreign exchange
Love Van but it's always fucking pouring with rain
For a second actually thought that I was going insane
Figured out I'm never letting life get boring again
