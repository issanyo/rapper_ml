[Hook 1: Mad Child]
It go's chase the dream
Create the scene
Face the flames
Erase the pain
It go's chase the dream
Create the scene
Face the flames
Erase the pain

[Verse One: Prevail]
Mountains concaved, great lake's of lava
Sing a midnight sonata
Same sting and Stigmata
Sinatra and Sammy Davis, me and my shadow
Extremely classy, Bohemian Rhapsody
The thicker the mixture, richest reds coagulate
Exposure to oxygen picture the canvas space
It's mine to interpret
Brush stroke Picasso
I write like Bram Stroker
My overtures colossal
Ten piece orchestra, the conductors baton
Electric conductors and sculptures of bronze
The vampire's powerful, the werewolf is strong
Homicidal tendencies enemies of dawn
Will create a kingdom made of pearl and onyx
Jack The Ripper black overcoat, the majors of darkness
Circular rings crack ponds of frozen ice
The surface thins while northern winds rekindle your life

[Hook 2:Mad Child]
Thoughts that creep through your head
We'll sleep when we're dead, we eat till were fed
Keep them at arms length
Rely on our strength
Keep doin' our thing
We build rebellion

[Hook 1: Prevail]

[Verse Two: Mad Child]
Serpent lie corralled
Snake swallow tail by a polar bear
Prevail kill a whale

Spirit of the mountain
Power from north men
One with the universe, release endorphins
Full breed gladiator dog electric eyes
Shed blood before we cry get exercised
Celebrated outlaw, killing with discipline
Ignite nitroglycerin, willing participants
Separation specialist, rap like it's effortless
Inhuman spider, I'm freedom fighter
Glide through galaxies
Shadow caster
Heavy metal thunder
Ghetto blaster
Fatal orchid
Pretty little secret
Tantric bliss
Dirty little weakness
Girls cannot be trusted, guys cannot be trusted
Clusters of gold explode, I'm star dusted

[Hook 2]

[Hook 1: Mad Child]

[Verse Three: Prevail]
Mercenaries blowing up on playgrounds of destruction
Mushroom cloud, frustration breaks morale
Earthbound mortals still slaves to sleep
Spirit forms in graves, worms and raven's beaks

[Mad Child]:
Stereo sound like merry-go-round
Kids laugh, bulldoze sacred burial ground
Poltergeist poem, ultimate sin
Assault with the pen, multiple wins
Back to where it all could begin
Fall to the ground so I could alter the end
Dream thief snatch world from oxygen
I'll save you from myself, shut the door then lock me in

[Prevail]:
Slash films
That's how my passions feels
Action reels, caught on tape, twist of fate
Crystal Lake campers, the mask and machete
Ignite the sulfur then gas 'em heavy
