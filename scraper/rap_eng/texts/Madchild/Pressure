[Verse 1]

My brain is on the fritz, I'm at my wits
And I rhyme one line, but can't find another that fits in
Missing, too many pieces to the puzzle
Maybe I should buy some alcohol so I can guzzle it down
To dry my sorrows and borrow some inspiration
I'm feeling total devastation. This is horrible, it's fucking terrible
I can't get one done, no fun, it's unbearable
Sittin' on the floor, bored out of my skull
Pressure, instead of fresher, I'm getting duller
No color, it's bad, I can't stand the rain
No pain, no gain. I must maintain my train of thinking
Sinking, down the drain into the sewer
Who were you to say what I'm doing wrong with my song
Don't trip, get a grip, It's as the tip of my tongue
About to rip, but lost the thought, I'm too high-strung
It's like a ball of confusion. Another dimension
With no direction, beyond comprehension
Rest for time, I'm racing against the clock
A mental block, I can't stand the pressure

[Verse 2]

Can't session, falling deep into depression
About to blow a fuse, I could use some suggestions
Questions dangle as I strangle my binder
Kind of like war digging deep into my core
For more creativity, give it the best shot that I got
Not forgotten, jotting down every thought
Not stable, I stand firm while shaking ground
Down on my luck, stuck in a bad situation
Facing the facts, I sit back in my bed
Veins bulging out the side of my head
Eyes are red, dead weight on my shoulders
When I hold the [?]
Nothing comes out, no doubt my mind is broken
Smoking cigarettes, I figure it'll help calm my nerves
And I'm nervous, feel like I'm out of surface
Which words to choose to loose my possession on my mission
Wishing for the best, less pressure

[Verse 3]

Clenching my fist as I mention the list of tension
Building on the third verse
You might have heard worse but I'm cursing and cussing
Shit, quit your fussing. Man, I'm just discussing
There's not enough action. Too many distractions
I ride the side track when I should stay on course
Not trying to get my face on the cover of the source
Just forcing, thoughts on to paper with the [?]
Still haven't made it, complicated like a rubik's cube
Watching the tube as I slouch on the couch
Knuckles cracking, lacking financial [?]
Racking my brain to gain concentration
Aggravation, must bust the frustration
Constipation of the dome, home lounging
Scrounging like a scavenger
Haven't ya ever been there before (fore)
Feel the pressure
