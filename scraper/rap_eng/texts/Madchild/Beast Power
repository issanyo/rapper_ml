[Madchild]
Yeah
Still killing

[Hook] A-O
I get my power from the belly of the beast (I get my power)
One thousand dreams per hour, no wonder I never sleep (no wonder I don’t sleep)
I’m a beast (I’m a beast). You a coward (you a coward)
I’m a beast (I’m a beast). You a coward (you a coward)
I’m a beast (I’m a beast). You a coward (you a coward)
All I need is that beast power. (Beast power)

[Verse 1] Madchild
Yo
Who the fuck you think you’re stepping to?
We the fucking Ducky Boys, we the wrecking crew
No more wandering around, I am finally home
I’ll rip your spinal cord and play it like a xylophone
And I don’t care if I’m alone
They say that I need therapy. There’s terror in my dome
You want a verse and a video? It’s four fucking thousand
I don’t give a shit if you’re in poor public housing
Meanest fucking bastard leaning with the ratchet
Batshit
Split your fucking skull with a hatchet
Rise like a phoenix from the ashes
My style’s leaning ‘cause it’s massive
Venus on its axis
Mentally I fornicate
Lyrically I mutilate
Moody in the studio
My mind is in a brutal state
Seems like every other month (damn) I break a tooth
Old and jaded, I’m a product of a wasted youth

[Hook] A-O
I get my power from the belly of the beast (I get my power)
One thousand dreams per hour, no wonder I never sleep (no wonder I don’t sleep)
I’m a beast (I’m a beast). You a coward (you a coward)
I’m a beast (I’m a beast). You a coward (you a coward)
I’m a beast (I’m a beast). You a coward (you a coward)
All I need is that beast power. (Beast power)

[Verse 2] Madchild
We are not common criminals
I work for my bread homie, play time is minimal
Black magic outlaw, angry little bastard
Bang like an orangutan that’s hanging from the rafters
Futuristic super-twisted, homie I go too ballistic
Not that I am too specific, but my group is super gifted
Most terrific, look with your peripheral it’s difficult
I’ll rhyme the size of epic proportion, this shit is biblical

[Verse 3] A-O
Yeah
Like Christ on the cross
I write to my thoughts, light them pipes in the dark
I’m a shark in the water, I can smell the blood
Double barrel shotgun to your lung like Elmer Fud
Yeah, where are the bunnies and ducks
I heard there was a couple sluts that’ll love me for a hundred bucks
So, do you go spare change?
‘Cause I want to buy a motorcycle and an airplane


[Hook] A-O
I get my power from the belly of the beast (I get my power)
One thousand dreams per hour, no wonder I never sleep (no wonder I don’t sleep)
I’m a beast (I’m a beast). You a coward (you a coward)
I’m a beast (I’m a beast). You a coward (you a coward)
I’m a beast (I’m a beast). You a coward (you a coward)
All I need is that beast power. (Beast power)

[Verse 4] A-O
I don’t sleep, I keep the speakers in my jeep, on blast
Run fast like the sneakers on my feet
I eat the beat, I need the heat
I need a freak that’ll be on her knees for at least a week
Like geez, Louise. Can you come here please?
Are you the one I want to “you know” when I need?
My eyes bleed and my eardrums is busted
I’m fucked. I can’t catch up without the mustard
Yeah. I’m hot dawg
I drop bombs ‘till I blow up in your mom’s palm
Like oww, I told her to quit jerking me
But every word I spit just fits together perfectly
Like scars from a surgery
Ain’t no hurting me
I’m strong like Hercules
A-O. You’ve probably never heard of me
But we could light the purple leaf and fly to Mercury

[Hook] A-O
I get my power from the belly of the beast (I get my power)
One thousand dreams per hour, no wonder I never sleep (no wonder I don’t sleep)
I’m a beast (I’m a beast). You a coward (you a coward)
I’m a beast (I’m a beast). You a coward (you a coward)
I’m a beast (I’m a beast). You a coward (you a coward)
All I need is that beast power. (Beast power)
