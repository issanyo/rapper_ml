(We can handle any fucking thing that comes our way.)

[Verse 1]
Madchild’s a veteran. Words still electric
Sat ‘til I became numb, now life’s hectic
Moved home, changed my system to metric
Build my strength now I’ve come back to wreck shit
Battleaxe skull, face paint like a Juggalo
Split personality, my mind’s playing tug of war
Vampires flying through my loft, spit rugged flows
Drink from a bucket of blood, doing my drug of choice
I was doing dangerous things
I was a spellbound hellhound, disabled my wings
Now I believe in angels and saints, they talk to me
Now the Silver Surfer’s flying through space
Aye
You’re beautiful in studio mode
But be done with all the coke and pharmaceuticals though
I feel this light on my left shoulder partially shine
Lost pieces of myself, they’re getting harder to find
My constituents, monsters that pop obituates
And everybody living like the cops still listening
There’s a riot going on in my mind, not pretty
Can’t say, just be glad I’m not your next door neighbour

[Hook]
Ayo, you feel up
Yeah, you feel up
Yeah, you feel up
But it all falls down

Yeah, you feel up
Yeah, you feel up
Now you’re way up
‘Cause it all falls down

[Verse 2]
Reflecting on a life filled with pain and regret
Whole time I’m being watched by the angel of death
Devil on my shoulder tried to sever my wings
But now I’m stomping on this monster with a devilish grin
Where do I want to end up?
Up in heaven with wings
But ‘til I get sent up build the heaven within
I’m still a sinner but surrender my soul
Just because you find a rainbow doesn’t mean you’re gonna end up with gold
Lightbulb shines above my head like “I got it”
It’s a bright idea, the light’s high wattage
Pop out of dark corners and bark orders
Still know how to make a dollar, four quarters
See the lines? It is due to the stress
Twenty years of my life, friends were shooters with vests
You already heard the story, I’m a beautiful mess
Even at rock bottom I’m still suitably dressed

[Hook]
Ayo, you feel up
Yeah, you feel up
Yeah, you feel up
But it all falls down

Yeah, you feel up
Yeah, you feel up
Now you’re way up
‘Cause it all falls down
