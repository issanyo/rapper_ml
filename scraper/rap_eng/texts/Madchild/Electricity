[Intro]
So I guess this is where I tell you what I learned
Life is to short to be pissed off all the time

[Verse 1]
They wanna hear me talk about some regular shit
But I am not a regular kid (Nope)
And I cannot remember shit that I did
Cause my memory's shit
Looking back at my life, oh god. Kinda hard to face
Try not to reminisce. I've been in the darkest place
I understand the feeling of depression
And truly understand the feeling of aggression
I'm talking blood boiling. I'm talking seeing red
I'm talkin' fits of jealousy, that should be me instead
When I see jealousy with girls, also had it bad
I fell in love so bad, that shit also drove me mad
I've been back stabbed, center of that shit talkin'
Picked my heart up off the ground and I kept walkin'
Insults thrown hard, I've been hit often
Killin' all my problems, I'mma need a big coffin
There's nobody to blame but myself
'Cause no one feel the pain but myself
How come rappers always wanna talk about wealth
And leave the real shit on the shelf
Someone explain it to me

[Hook]
Life moves so fast then it's over
Nobody really tryna stop to smell the roses
I got a fucked up past, I need closure
At least now I'm tryna stop to smell the roses
Life goes so quick, then it's over
It took everything I had to get sober
I gotta make things right to have closure
At least now I'm tryna stop to smell the roses

[Verse 2]
I think of all the things I've done. I should be proud
People try entering my life, I'm like keep out
(please record your message)
Cause I don't trust you
Let me rephrase that, I only trust few
Trust me
There's been way to many disappointments
Might be why I'm always late, not trippin' if I miss appointments
Look. I'm not a fan of human beings in general
Look at how the meat gets to our dinner plate, it's criminal
That's why I love dogs. Man I love dogs
Love is unconditional, that's why I also love God
I love Jesus and my Guardian Angels
That's why I love my family and never party with strangers
I'm super picky with new friends, I keep it real tight
Depression still a problem, something that I still fight
I don't give a fuck about a social life, that's ill right?
Focus on today and being happy, that is real life

[Hook]
Life moves so fast then it's over
Nobody really tryna stop to smell the roses
I got a fucked up past, I need closure
At least now I'm tryna stop to smell the roses
Life goes so quick, then it's over
It took everything I had to get sober
I gotta make things right to have closure
At least now I'm tryna stop to smell the roses

[Verse 3]
(Third verse, go.)
I used to try to impress people
Now I could give a flying fuck about people
Don't get it wrong I got some friends that are amazing
A couple great EX girl friends that drove me crazy
It wasn't their fault, I am just a recluse
Love to sit at home, and write rhymes and let the freak loose
I've gotta get 7 teeth pulled, real shit
How come all these rappers they afraid to talk 'bout real shit
(Tell me that)
A bunch of liars make me real sick
Regurgitated saturation's what we deal with
It's all good though, keep workin' I'm not lazy
I'm here to rap and tell my fans it's ok to be crazy
We're all a little crazy (That's for fact)
That's a special bonus
While their favorite rapper is a demented tatted Leprechaun
I've learned a lot in life, happy to be teaching
Just know that if you need me you can reach me

[Hook]
Life moves so fast then it's over
Nobody really tryna stop to smell the roses
I got a fucked up past, I need closure
At least now I'm tryna stop to smell the roses
Life goes so quick, then it's over
It took everything I had to get sober
I gotta make things right to have closure
At least now I'm tryna stop to smell the roses

[Outro]
Like I said before and i'll say it again
It's OK to be a little crazy man
