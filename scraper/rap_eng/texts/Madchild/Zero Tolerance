[Verse 1: Snak the Ripper]
Yeah, yo
I'll be, medicated 'till the day of my expiry
Ain't got retirement, cus I'm the one that hired me
Unemployed, lick it up, the kid spits fiery
I'm the one these other rappers dissing in their diary
The masked avenger
Been smacked since last November
My life's a bender, so the past I can't remember
But I can see the future
Poison darts quick to shoot you
Aimed to fuck the game on different angles, Kama Sutra
I'm a, flex your brain like the effects of mescaline
This white boy hardcore, like backyard wresltin'
Destined for the top with the best of them
Enemies come around, watch me make a mess of 'em
The leaders of the pack heater
In the back, dirty beater
Eager to attack, one can beat us 'till we yack
So sophisticated, everybody wanna have a taste
Black glove, no love, man, I got it on my face

[Hook]
Born master with the faster blade, track slasher
Keep your arms distance
Zero tolerance
Narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman
Zero tolerance
Born master with the faster blade, track slasher
Murder rap, kill you soft like Roberta Flack
Arms distance, zero tolerance

[Verse 2: MadChild]
Yo, yo, yo
Little monster, I am stomping on your confidence
They try to copy me in concert, they're not competent
Time for you to get electrocuted by the sexy beast
I'm sober now, but I am high like I'm on ecstasy
We came from Canada, 'cus I'm a restless beast
And anybody disagree, they're gonna rest in peace
'Cus you don't want to wrestle with aggressive aliens
Oppressive with my efforts, when I flex like Hulkamania
Transpire as a vampire from Transylvania
'Cus I'm a crazy maniac
That still listens to 80's rap
I broke my piggy bank and had to put it back together
I pull my axe and that's exactly when these tracks get severed
And I'll attack a stripper
With fucking Snak the Ripper
We got friends that got more tools at home than Black & Decker
But now I no longer involve myself with wack endeavours
And I'll keep grinding on these rappers 'til they crack like pepper

[Hook]

[Verse 3: MadChild & Snak the Ripper]
Yo, yo
Yo, misguided angel and the masked avenger
Action ninjas like to enter on a craft's adventure
Yeah, this world is filled with sharks, but I'm a giant piranha
And I am fucking fast and furious like Brian O'Conner
I'm an anarchist
Spitting lyrics like I'm firing bullets from an automatic rifle with banana clip
They go ballistic as this exorcism escalates
So hop inside the Escalade and join our escapade
Sharper than the blade you use to give your neck a shave
Weapons on the set to put a fucking heckler in the grave
Dissect my heart and you can see it's empty like my bank account
I do it for the love, but money, that's some shit to think about
Return to the gutter, EXACTO
Sharper than the box cutter, to butter up Snak's flow
No artificial creation, it comes natural
I'm addicted to pussy, so fuck 'em, I'm an asshole

[Hook]
