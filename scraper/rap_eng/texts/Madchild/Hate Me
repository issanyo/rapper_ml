So ya'll could hate me, Ya'll could hate me
That I could give a fuck about these haters let them run their mouths
So ya'll could hate me, cause ya'll just hate me
Anything like what I become, a warrior since I was young
So ya'll could hate me

[Verse 1] Chris Webby

That Suburban good fella, mozzarella with the skin tone
Hated by every rapper that's headed to the end zone
Webby's already there
Fingers around the stitching of the pig skin Connecticut jersey baby it's [?]
So many tapes that even haters gotta listen
Yo I got these kids hooked, mawfucka  gon' fishing
Medicinal hit that we rippin' gives them the sickest of visions
Body a verse, ready to hit em' and twist a rhythm
Sizzling raps, get on the track if they don't know it yet
Flying over haters jetpack on some Boba Fett shit
I'm the dopest yet, don't even let the text speak
Lyrical R2 button, blow you to next week
Labels knocking as the buzz gets bigger
But with all this independent bread I lead like 7 figures
Not to sound greedy but I made myself a name
You could love it or hate it, just stay the fuck out of my way
(Bitch!)

So ya'll could hate me, Ya'll could hate me
That I could give a fuck about these haters let them run their mouths
So ya'll could hate me, cause ya'll just hate me
Anything like what I become, a warrior since I was young
So ya'll could hate me

[Verse 2] Madchild

They either love it or they hate it, that's an actual fact
But I be flippin' on these bars like an acrobat
Haters are bitches with the lower back and ankle tat
I'm trying to get my shit together like a Natural path
Stick my finger out the window yelling "Hi Haters!"
You could suck a dick and ass fuck a vibrator
I used to move a lot of weed in a hockey bag
Now baby rocky's back, killing all these copy cats
I tackle actors with immaculate brute force
Took off in an Acura, came back in a new Porsche
Rappers think they're hot. They are not, they are lukewarm
New king of Canada, that's why I wear a tuque for
Opposite of old and bitter, one of the coldest spitters
These fucking fairies they just rap and spit out golden glitter
I'm here, your stuck with me. I'm someone that you won't get rid of
And selling out like them is something that I won't consider

[Hook] Johnny Spanish
So ya'll could hate me, Ya'll could hate me
That I could give a fuck about these haters let them run their mouths
So ya'll could hate me, cause ya'll just hate me
Anything like what I become, a warrior since I was young
So ya'll could hate me

[Verse 3]

Battle me and that'll be a glamorous war
Madchild, I'm like the rapper that you battled before
And I am adamant I have to be the baddest on tour
Little Hulk smash I've got the hammer of Thor
Was living lavish before, Now abracadabra
I'll crawl up your cadaver. I'm a savage that's pure
So welcome to the Labyrinth. Rocking you like Nazareth
Little spooks of hazard for their mind, I'm fucking hazardous
The harshest threat. Got the sharpest head. Ya, the darkest Vet
But I'm in hardcore debt
It's hard to hate me cause I'm known to make the planet rock
Kamikaze with the battleaxe and a tomahawk
But you ain't doin' something right unless you got haters
Even though they know that I'm dark like Darth Vader
And they start really coming out when you get extra big
But most of them are full of shit [?]

[Hook] Johnny Spanish
So ya'll could hate me, Ya'll could hate me
That I could give a fuck about these haters let them run their mouths
So ya'll could hate me, cause ya'll just hate me
Anything like what I become, a warrior since I was young
So ya'll could hate me
