[Verse 1: Del]
Del, murderess world wind of wit
Get the worse of I break it down bit by bit
Yet, a nerve my graphics cause seizures you slur, and your memory blurs
A sure bet, Dell never fails clever tells
The pear on his quest
With the terrorist
Sending MC to the therapist
My microphone will be a family heirloom hmm
Awaits a white rappers dominate rappers on the scared straight after a clever track
With exactlin flows that attract befores when it comes
To rappers like smores that cause puke
I duke newcomers and those who slumber (Ha Ha Ha)
I under ones who's mostly dedicated to the leading of
Previous tedious trauma behind nothin faller
Use the mileage A flavor fiddles with my pallet
You know I can't allow it
Bow if you recognize royalty
My motor skills is more like a well oiled machine
Any team that we construct we'll blow your dreams up
In flames names all evaporated when my powers activated
Have to make it fun Think that you dunk me or dip me lift me
Why'd you have to pick me when your
Points strictly stripped your brothers of their props
When I rock any facility with artillery like Attila
You rap with all filler and I'm sure the crickets and fireflies
Don't try to dispute we shoot straight and rarely miss
And go anywhere we wish
But MCs comin' up who can barely piss
Watch what you say
Watch how you think
Watch how you act

[Verse 2: Mad Child]
Fire in the hole stare into the glare
The flare rips your retina no way to prepare
For combat cock is sharp a Autobot
Brain cells bust lines laced with angel-dust
X-factor, X-men declare war
Send your ambassador
Send the whole peace core
No shore carnivore attacks and concords
Mutant assassins, and silent saboteurs
Let me take a stab at your track rewind it back
Select or access code is hacked
Rock steady reinforcement enhanced advancement
Audiences senses audio transmit
Thunderous storm strikes with ma jolt and
All hard rock like Thing from fantastic four
Prune beneath the moon lit rips solar eclipse
Madchild flips like kids on acid trips

[Verse 3: Unicorn]
Unicaron formin the union all aluminum
Tracks by Dell just boomin on
Quality systems all of these tracks we can't list em
Ditch em. fuck em, reluctant to kick bullshit
Put the fold it like the narrows wearing sombrero chip up the weapons blowing up some Winnebago with bitches under the stagecoach age old definition of
Pimping 18A, it's a raping in the date game that they may change in break dames in the high speed make them want to try me but never give Mikey the ties
The unlikely slice me as being forward walks by us shy, caller, holler at me fool that's a cool sack but you can't loose black too fast straight from the
Ton and down the prove that but you knew that remember how we do that you whack

[Verse 4]
I'm the unread lock corner storming professor X
My neural networks best like what works
Lets first analyze the 21 gun sound
Then realize that if it's stereo
I won't be surrounded Astounded and amazed praise like two common
I have nothing in common with the layman
And the plane I shake magic like a shaman on a red clay plate
I'm uncommon and way beyond Darwin
The ultimate test of aptitude is my universal appetite of altitude
Triple tons terms you climb when I rhyme
Newton's apple had worms
But there's a killer on the road
So you should read the signs
Come to terms with the modern man of clarity
An MC of rarity truly a rock odyssey
Gotta see I'm odabe an a mentally parking me follow me
If you'd be angels where fools fit a tread in they only see my back cause
I'm three steps ahead of them
Look at em dead in the eye
Their as crooked as a cloud in the sky
Well I'm the who, what, why, where, when of sewer rats multiply
More plagues will descend
I wore like the kin like they wore like Lord Shin
(What you tryin to say Prev)
Yo let me try this again
As high as we ascend I woke break a bend
My soul was carried by the crow but delivered
By the red Key my played like sound bytes speak Wordsworth
Like ten at the scientist experiments I prevail as win
