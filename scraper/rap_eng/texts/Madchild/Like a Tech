[Scratch Hook]

[Verse 1]

I'm like an automatic when it static
I start blastin' rhymes out my mouth cause I'm a rappin' assassin
Passing as I pick up the pace like a race
And I must kick up dust so I can hold my place
It's pathetic. I'm not even athletic
But I'm runnin' laps around you son
Just forget it
Skip the mumbo jumbo, I'm fly like dumbo
Kids trip and stumble when they hear I wanna rumble on the mic
Cause I never mumble like a bumble bee
I gets busy
Makes your head dizzy
Spinnin' like a propeller on a helicopter
I dropped ya
When we was rockin' acapella hella fresh oh yes, I guess I must confess
To battle as a cinch I make an MC flinch
So sit back, relax while I wreck these tracks
I get the message across like a fax
And Imma get to the point, like a dagger
I'll crush you like a bus gettin hit by thirty taggers
If you disrespect when I jump on the set
You can bet, no sweat cause I jam like a tech

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse 2]

Don't sleep
I won't creep
I step like Godzilla when he's crushin' Tokyo
Cause I'm an MC killa
It's the, Madchild. The opposite of soft
Strong like King Kong but not about to fall off
Hold my position cause from where I stand
I kick ass like Jackie Chan
Or Black belt Jones
When the microphone's in my clutch
I'm vicious
My technique makes [?]
You smash glasses, I'm thick like molasses
Asses get Chucked like Norris, Check the chorus

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse 3]

Your bottom lip drops cause I skip pop and stick with hip hop
And rip tops off arenas
Step on the scene and I'm meaner then a pitbull
I got whatcha need, I'll feed you raps till you get full
Oh whats the flavor? Alright here's a taste
I flow like the Silver Surfer when he's gliding through space
And in a battle your a toy like a rattle in a cradle
When I flex you drop the mic like your playin' hot potato
Cause my rap flows loosely like Bruce Lee's technique
I cause a panic attack on the track when I speak
So hush
I'm comin' and rushin' and I crush kids who rap like shit
I get pissed so then I flush
Oh but you roll deep like the Hell's Angels
Man I ride the rugged rhythm like a Harley
I'm thick like Beef and barley soup
Troop, loop the sample
I spin the instrumental and your crew will get trampled
Just an example when the Madchild speaks
Cause I (Jam like a Tech with correct technique)
