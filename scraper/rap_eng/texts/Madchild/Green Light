[Hook]
There’s a time when we all meet our maker
Stay on our grind ‘cause we all need our paper
We find love but eventually break up, then make up
We all fall asleep and then we wake up

Pay attention. We all have our calling
The point is get back up when you’re falling
I lift my joint back up and quit stalling
Let the chips land where they lay
I go all in

[Verse 1] Madchild

I’m on a warpath
Give me more death
My ink is poisonous
Got Agent Orange breath
Blood drenched, still attacking, it’s a savage war
Bab it more
Complicated addict with these habits formed
They look to me for help, be more reliable
Suicidal bomber, homicide is justifiable
Pounding on my chest causing more tears
Sniper on the roof. This is real guerilla warfare
Slow it down, let my mind meet my maker
And let my pain bleed onto lined sheets of paper
Underground but different level of wealth
I love God but I snap like the Devil himself
I’m a baffling beast
So rappers kneel in front of me like I’m a Catholic priest
These kids are yellow like a daffodil leaf
I’m a driving force so jump into the passenger’s seat
Or keep falling (keep falling)

Pay attention. We all have our calling

I lift my joint back up and quit stalling
Let the chips land where they lay
I go all in

[Verse 2] Madchild

I tried being normal
Fuck being normal
Skin weathered leather
Still mad pain and turmoil
We do not share the same black magic
And you do not got the same bad habits
And I cannot hang out with old friends, they’re all violent
Sitting here alone with my thoughts, that’s loud silence
And I can see like every mistake with closed eyelids
Keep playing them all back in my head, it’s so tiring
If you don’t think I’m ill by now you must be real deaf
Penalty for stealing the King’s dinner is still death
Balance in my cash flow are not going corporate
You falling down, I’ll lift you up like a forklift
I write with blood in a calligraphy pen
My style is vigorous and vicious with an ignorant blend
And you can see the go signal again
It’s green light, the rise and fall like Caligula again
It’s alright
