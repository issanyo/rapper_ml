[Prevail]
Arabian nights, abrasions and spikes, slaves to the mic
In the tomb of no daylight, we consume when it sounds right
Explode through pipe and pressure, pay the piper
Play the record, stay undetected, paint the leopard
If it ain't worth the effort-quit
We've been in effect, thrown back in the pit, scarred and nicked
Stereo stardom, the kingdom of nuclear bombin'
The return of burgundy autumn is here in Eve's garden
Mirages, novices over my shoulder like harvest
Wild jaw crushes the shell of the scarab
The sacred marriage of the tribes of Hared, lies for carob
When we arrive on dark horse and carriage
You ride with the pride and the knowledge of Era
Mummification through alliteration an' bomb the calm
Arm and leg, I drag a common man through the sand while he begs for rain
You see, the things that have been poppin' in my brain, are made for stoppin trains
Oxygen boxed up in hexagonal frames
Hard to breathe? It ain't all that hard to believe, it's part of my breed
Jackals an' hounds, maximum rounds
Trackin' 'em down is fun, my name is Prev One
Disaster fund, mudslide the blind and dumb
A dime a dozen look alikes with frozen tongues
The chosen ones who came to tame the poison sons

[Mad Child & Prevail]
They say good things come to those who wait
But didn't tell us how long it's gonna take
But who are they, anyway?
Some can't relate, we gonna say what we wanna say
An' we gonna say what we wanna say
Some can't relate, we gonna say what we wanna say
