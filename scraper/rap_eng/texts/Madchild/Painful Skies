[Intro]
Look
I know what I did
And I'm not sitting here blaming anyone else
I'm not feeling sorry for myself either

[Verse 1]

Yo
I listen to this beat it makes me think of what I've been through
All of the mistakes and stupid shit that I got into
All the fuckin' fakeness of people that I made friends with
So 98 percent of those friendships, I had to end it
I'm to old to be worried and keep pretending
And I apologize to some of the people deeply offended
But I can't live in the past, that shit just wears me down
That shit just tears me up inside and fucking tears me down
I'm not the man I was then, but I am not running
And I am not yet the man that I am still becoming
I'm getting stronger everyday and I can fucking feel it
And all the problems of my past one day I'm gonna deal with
Thanks for your patience I apologize for each occurrence
And I just hope that you can take this as some reassurance
My life is good. each day is better than the next day
But I have not forgotten won't settle till every debts payed

[Hook]

Time changes
Each man ages
And sometimes best friends become strangers
Each life's a book with blank pages
Last ten years it's a chapter that's outrageous
Time changes
Every man ages
And sometimes best friends become strangers
Tears, anger and laughter we can't change it
Listen to your hearts. We're protected by angels

[Verse 2]

Look
Let me make this clear I don't regret my whole past
Can't believe how time flies, shit has gone by so fast
You let me in your secret world and that was quite an honor
And I admit that that's a life I thought I might have wanted
Probably of pursued If I hadn't gotten caught up
But flags they started raising with these kids all gettin' shot up
And I became addicted to a drug that almost took my life
Lookin' back that might of been the only thing that saved my life
I'm full of love now, I'm Happy. I don't harbor hatred

Pretty sure that's how God wants us and to me that's sacred

I'm not sitting here judging and calling ya'll some vagrants
And I'm not pointing fingers questioning your occupations
I'm just hoping that the way I feel can shine some light
I know you got a good heart dawg. It's time to stop the fight
And let yourself become the man that your supposed to be
I still believe in you. No matter what, you're always close to me

[Hook]

Time changes
Each man ages
And sometimes best friends become strangers
Each life's a book with blank pages
Last ten years it's a chapter that's outrageous
Time changes
Every man ages
And sometimes best friends become strangers
Tears, anger and laughter we can't change it
Listen to your hearts. We're protected by angels

[Verse 3]

And I know becoming friends again ain't possible, at least for years
And fucking up for me is still a problem that I deeply fear
Only got a couple close friends now. That's how I like it
And I think I'm actually gonna make it, but I'm not a psychic
One of them's a brother proud to say that he's my best friend
Come on man! you got some fucking brothers, let this shit end
It's sad to me to see that greed is still The Devil's weapon
I tried my best to walk away from shit and kept steppin'
Brothers doin' good, his heart is filled with love
And we gon keep on building with these people that believe in us
Remember there was four of us till death do us part
Now there's only two of us the rest grew apart
It doesn't mean I don't think about you too, every week
And even if we never speak there's still a bond i'll never leave
I hope your happy and your family is doin' awesome
And hope that your still following the progress of the little monster
You had a hand and that helped and saved my life, I won't forget
Let's live the next half with no regrets, cause it ain't over yet

[Hook]

Time changes

And sometimes best friends become strangers
