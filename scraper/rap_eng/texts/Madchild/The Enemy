[Verse 1: Slaine]
I'm full of anxiety, this black cloud it just hangs by me
A vampire fiendin' for blood on his fangs probably
Is how they eye me so they flee like its a bank robbery
Look at me oddly when I hobble through the dang lobby
They can't divide me from the violence that I hide inside me
Traumatized me with their silence and their eyes deny me
But I'm a tyrant and a giant with a nine beside me
And so I'm flying with defiance like a kamikaze
Now I'm a lion, I'm an enemy, a heartless zombie
I'm never dying in your memory, your mind can find me
In my apartment blindly pacin' cause the darkness calm me
A mental patient with the patience of Mahatma Gandhi
To find the proper blondie, leave her on the carpet calmly
Ditch the bitch's carcass in the marshes so no cop can find me
I told you not to wind me up but now it's too late
I'll be your lover boy and baby you can be my new hate

[Hook: Rite Hook]
Walking alone in this world got me feeling like the enemy
I don't exist in the world, but I'll make sure I'm a memory
Nowhere to go
Now here I come, run, get it done one
That's what [?] you under the sun
I don't exist in the world, but I'll make sure I'm a memory
Cause I'm your Enemy


[Verse 2: Madchild]
I don't like to talk a lot or leave my creepy hideout
Tonight the viewers gonna watch me rip your damn insides out
This is something building up to strategize and calculate
One I'm gonna strangle then I'll throw her off the balcony
I get anxiety attacks, my heart, it palpitates
At rapid rates, get a calming rush when I decapitate
Whack off on your bashed in face 'til I ejaculate
A panic strictly manic depression, you should evacuate
I have a night of revenge, that's planned immaculately
With an X-Acto Blade, to cut exact and accurately
When all these girls see that I react so passionately
I guarantee there will be no more people laughing at me
You might think that this all started from a porn site
But this disturbed psychotic character just wasn't born right
Smiling violently, I'm killing Kylie, Kat and Kimberly
From no one to a someone, the world's gonna remember me


[Hook: Rite Hook]
Walking alone in this world got me feeling like the enemy
I don't exist in the world, but I'll make sure I'm a memory
Nowhere to go
Now here I come, run, get it done one
That's what [?] you under the sun
I don't exist in the world, but I'll make sure I'm a memory
Cause I'm your Enemy


[Outro: Rite Hook]
Cause i'm your Enemy
