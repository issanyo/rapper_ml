[Verse 1: Adlib]
Straight from the hip when I'm shooting, Duke Nukem
Leave mushroom clouds fuming while I'm lighting this Cuban
I'm out of this world, I am subhuman
Mutant, my right hook like Ryuken
You motherfuckers living in delusion
I ain't rapping on these tracks, I'm puking
My verse is a virus, son it's frightening
I brought the Viking, this is son of titans
It's clobbering time, turn bullies to mimes
Put 'em all in a line, rock 'em one at a time
Out the gutter I climb, covered in grime
I'm a real slime ball, spew sinister rhymes
You punks don't have a spine
I'm a stand up guy, put your hands up high
Now let's get high, torch your cessy
Gory and deadly, I'm Voorhees' machete

[Hook x2: Madchild]
Generally speaking, mentally I'm freaking
Open up my mouth and ten of me are speaking
Demented, never settling, I'm venomous and creeping
Calling me a veteran but gentleman, I'm peaking

[Verse 2: Adlib]
I'm from the BAX WAR cult, they call me warlord
Keep my Jordan box underneath the floorboard
Stuff a couple grand in it with a .4-4
I ain't 'bout games, go watch the scoreboard
I'm on tour, paint chaos beautifully
The 21st Century Schooly D
Absolute lunacy, my team lead the mutiny
Sensi Starr, got mason jars of that mutant weed
We on Google speed, you stalk news feed
I'm the new breed, you're a fucking groupie
True emcee, I am what it used to be
Get used to me, ain't no moving me
Sonically, I'm bombing the set
Live as they get, long as I'm alive I'm a threat
So place your bet, you're losing your chips
I'm a typhoon tycoon, sinking your ship

Beast mode

[Hook x2: Madchild]
