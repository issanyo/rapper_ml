Self Abuse, help produce Black Magic
Deeply depressed, I'm the best that's tragic
You don't really wanna get me all fired up...

[Verse One] [Mad Child]:
It goes: Red Bull and vodka
I'm a psycho like Chopper
Glorify the gangster whether handcuffed or locked up
Drink Pepsi-Cola same friends still rolling
Still Swollen, only difference is the heat that I'm holding
You don't really wanna get me all fired up
You'll be the one that ends up with his mouth wired shut
High voltage cause power outages
Set a bad example for the youth
How 'bout it kids?
Mad Child's starting an army who wanna join it?
Warriors raise your fists if you enjoying it
Soldiers of fortune, chainsaw massacre
Brain react fast when a maniacs after you
Guilt stirs in the silence of my room
Can't hold back with God, still sin follows through
Black jack, fire arms, foreign cars, trying hard
Forest fires, horrified, war cries, iron bars

[Hook]:
Black Magic, spit life with every breath
Not likely to forget, it's like we never left
Black Magic, the worlds screaming for change
Who's feeling this pain, are we dreaming in vain>
Black Magic, are we dreaming in vain?
Black Magic, you feeling the same pain?
Can;t fear what we don;t understand
Gone back down beneath, heads high, upper hand
Black Magic

[Verse Two] [Prevail]:
The dark arts, incantations and spell craft
Circles and stars the same fury that hell hath

De humani corporis fabrica
The structure of the human body, welcome to Gattaca
Twin girls in the hallway, elevators of blood
Spin words like spider's silk burn when the fires built
Doves fly, straight from the hands of a Replicant
Run the Blade futuristic cities of the heaven sent
I'm home melted chrome and twisted metal
Surrealist literature from the seamless vessel
The dark arts incantations and spell craft circles and stars
The same fury that hell hath
Feathers of an Osprey, leather glove of the falconeer
Treasure chests of gold, tales told then you all come near
Photons and gammas, rays and beams
Sailed with Jason and the Argonauts in ancient leagues
The lords of the hidden world s√©ance and candlelight
Connections to spirits that dance in the afterlife

[Hook]

[Verse Three] [Mad Child]:
Shane's brain a hurricane, it's a death march
Never let your dream die, that;s the best part
Storm rider man I snap like a pit
Axe murderer, get hacked up to bits
Muscle car, hard bar, Heineken, porn stars, tour bus
Truck stop, iron horse, motocross
Mad paints a poetic self portrait
Warlock that rocks still locked in fortress

[Prevail]:
Contortionists, swallowers of knives and fire-eaters
Nonconformist performers that won't change
And I won't either
I can see the future like Nostradamus
A bridge over troubled waters
Something wicked this way comes
The scythe and the hour glass in a capsule of morphine
Drag chains around the castle grounds
Dressed in darker clothing
Pit and the pendulum, serpent and the rainbow
My lineage the arrow, my bloodline the crossbow

[Hook]
