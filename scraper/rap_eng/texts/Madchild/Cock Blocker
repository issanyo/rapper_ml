[Intro]
Yo what's up. Hey, it's Madchild. You guys let me in man. It's Madchild from Swollen Members guys...

[Hook: Madchild]
Walk into the room, an intentional cock blocker
Talk awkward, pop off and rock proper
Big stack of rhymes sits inside of my top locker
Vest like a biker, bottom and top rockers
Walk into a room, unintentional cock blocker
Talk awkward, pop off and rock proper
Prev spitting rhymes harder than a gobstopper
With Rob's knocker, louder than a rock opera

[Verse 1: Madchild]
I walk into a mall with a gun, people are panicking
Scream "Fuck the world" then I shoot a couple mannequins
Hop onto my bike and ride away like Sons of Anarchy
With a bunch of other kids looking for more fun and shenanigans
We all have been abandoned, I don't need your damn companionship
Man handling manurism, a maniac with manuscripts
I'm the, I'm the Little Monster spittin' the purest raps
People linin' up like I'm a tourist trap, I'm sure of that
My raps are baffling, they probably think that Mad is daffy
But Mad is happy, kinda baddie, plus a chatty cappy
Got a handicap, cap the size of Andy Capp
Got a strap handy in my backpack, best that you're standing back
The band is back together like bandits in cracked leather
Black bandanas with tassels and tan feathers
You can get mangled by a Bengal tiger
Don't make me give a shit cause you'll find that you're my fiber

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Prevail]
We're standing waste deep in shit creek
With a rap geek and a sick freak
With a beat maker that'll eat fakers like mince meat
Since blitzkrieg was on screen
We've long dreamed for our team to rival yours
Screwdrivers thought eyeballs, I sky fall from travel wars
What's mine is yours unless, of course
You diss the North and piss me off
When I rap about when my pistol pops
I tap em out, let the bodies drop
It's gravity actually too, why you acting all Humpty dude
I'll spill your blood like zippity do
I'll kill your crew like lickity spit
I think you might be thinking lightly, things are slightly changed
I pulled some chains around your neck then washed you down the drain
The spiral is viral, it's liable to defile you
X-files for miles, where our freestyles are driving through town
Who threw down? New ground broken
There's a black hawk down and the helicopters smokin'
This is hostile territory, hospital beds and inventory
Lots of em dead already
Heavy shells, we bombin' everybody

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Madchild]
Now I got these lyrics, theyâ€™re bubbling in my noggin
Huddled in my room while hobbling like a goblin
Old and now the force is with me like I'm Yoda
Similar resemblance from cigarettes and soda
Multiple personalities altering Mad's reality
Cultivate abnormality into an awesome salary
Form like voltron
These three, compatible
Know deep leading vanity
A meat eating animal
Receding hairline
Beast eating their minds
Keep breeding rare, feeding terror, breathing airline
My microphone is a machete in it's own right
Promise that I won't bite, furniture is bone white
And I will not commit myself to an asylum
Even though I'm schizo and my thoughts are awful violent
I know how to clear a room, hockey mask and tear gas
Smoke bombs and bear mace filling up your staircase

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, if you wasn't down before, you definitely ain't getting down now. You can't reach us no more bitch, that's not a threat, that's a promise
