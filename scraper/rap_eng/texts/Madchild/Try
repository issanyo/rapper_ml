Try
Hard as ya' can
To understand
This runnin' in circles
Got me wonderin'
I- I- I don't know why
We pay it any mind
Baby I'm blind
How would we know
If we don't even
Try...

[Verse 1]

Ever since the ninth of July to the day that
I faded tonight in the sky
Cuz I never wanna be the thing that you hear many say
Like "I could've been, I should've been, but never did it anyway"
Livin' day to day a nickel spent a penny saved
Feelin' homeless always lookin' for some change
Change o' mind, my mind is gone I want it back
Trainwreck rapper keep my life on the track
Anyone is everyone an' anything is everything
An' no one is a nobody I know it in my brain
Heard a wise man say an' I'll say it the same

[Verse 2]

I'm tryin' to get up, get out, an' get some thin'
An' still live up to what I've said

An' now an' then it might feel like I'm runnin' in circles
I just gotta keep jumpin' the hurdles and

[Interlude]

Well maybe I'm older
Maybe my heart's cold
Or maybe it's yours
Tell me to get over
This chip on my shoulder
That's bringin' me down

[Verse 3]

Well I got my word, and my pride, no job, no credit
Found my one true love but got co-dependant
I got no things I got no image
Got a lot more goals an' not close to finished
I got a dream an' a pipe that's it
A drum machine an' a mic to spit
Got a career that made me cheat on my wife - a mistress named life
An' I ain't treatin' her right either
Vice versa got some tight verses
Hope the first of the month some thin' might surface
It just might and it might just not
It's a flip of the coin I suppose I just gotta
