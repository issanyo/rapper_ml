[Verse 1] Prevail
You got butterflies in your stomach, you’re nervous with dry mouth
Locked jaw, stage fright, writers block, timeout
Grab the mic, apply force. Light it like July 4th
The sound of the crowd gets me high like I’m on timewarp
Psychedelic elegant beats from the elephant
Raw benevolent teachers of anything relevant
Laws of probability, laws of average
Laws of gravity, displacement show that I’m massive (Heavy)
I sustain my energy through my caloric intake
Minerals, vitamins, proteins, fats and carbohydrates
I spike my insulin level by chomping on candy
Chopping down and slip pansies with my Battleaxe family (warriors)
Pack ‘em in like a cannery, sardines and aluminum
Harder than a marine, sorry if there’s any confusion
The drill bit sergeant, skill saws, chainsaws
Y’all don’t want it so why you starting arguments cous, ‘cause all that does is lead to hypertension
Which makes me stress out and start slicing tendons
Damaging nerve endings and crushing skeletal frames
They call me Prevail Wonder. What an incredible name

[Verse 2] Madchild
This is an improved movement
Darkness descends upon a profound process
Impossible to stop this
Personality conflicts, articulate rage
I’ll take a step back quick, pick a particular phase
Please throw away the keys, I need to be locked away
‘Cause of the brightness of my night and the darkness of my day
I’m on a different page but I’m a team player
I can’t abandon my family, that wouldn’t be fair
I’m trying to repair broken dreams while focusing
I can’t ignore the fact that most people ain’t dope as me
It’s hopeless if you even think of trying to start shit
I’m throwing heat, you’ll need the fire department
With the wildest swordman of style, hide in your fortress
File the report ‘cause Madchild is corporate
But you can’t separate me from the dark arts
Ice in my veins, cold blooded with a sharks heart
Professions of a dangerous mind but this ain’t really me no more
I’m doing things you never seen before

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse 3] Moka Only
Yeah
Last to rap, let me take a stab at it
I’m math magic, I’m addicted to bad habits
Simple life, I don’t drive a still cabin
But when opportunity knocks I will grab it and twist it’s motherfucking throat
I’m pent up
Content ‘til I spent every little red cent up
My mission is to glisten and gleam and get burned like kerosene
I’m so embarrassing to your self-esteem
Y’all scared for bitch reasons
Look at it, the game ain’t changed for six seasons
For this reason I’m down with heavy weights who still style and still kill, never hesitate
Fat Jack, I’ve been feeling your shit for a minute, and a half
So let’s hit it to win it and the cash
LA’s finest, BC’s most prestigious
The mammal and the elephant like, “Holy, Sweet Jesus”
