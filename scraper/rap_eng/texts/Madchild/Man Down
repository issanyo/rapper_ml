[Verse 1] Demrick
You know murder is a case, burn them on the waist
And ain't nobody safe, would you love a taste
And I never love a bitch, I just fuck her face
While you niggas runnin' plates, I just run and take
Told my homie Madchild he's on a loose cannon
Two bottles of Jameson, nigga who's standing?
And this kush got my head on a new planet
New track, I do damage, that's a new canvas
I paint pictures, drink liquor, smoke swishers
You go against us
You get in the trigger
You ain't with us
Niggas swear they saints but tell me you ain't sinners
I go hard in the paint, do the fucking paint thinner

[Verse 2] Madchild
Ya
Chatter box rocks, The Hulk, I'm angriest
Skin turned green, I'm sipping on Sangrias
Little champion, I'm sick of these damn pee-ons
Green eyed devil a level they can't be on
I'm an idiot that's ignorant, Light pigment
Torture rappers with a fucking lit cigarette
I kill verses, just for the thrill of it
So I'm an axe carrying, mass murdering militant
Magnificence, Lines of significance
I cause ridiculous predicaments
16 hours on train, insane discipline
Kill em' while I have a million, the cyphers are listening

[Demrick]
I dodge imprisonment
Fall from a gentleman
Get sucked off in my drawers in a pendleton
Born out love, gun draws bust ten of em'
Battle Axe letter man, Battle field veteran

[Hook] Demrick
My enemies
They want me all gone a long time ago
Niggas just don't see
That I don't give a fuck what they say
No games, we could all die today, OK (OK!)

Man Down!
Man Down!
Man Down!
Fuck you and your bitch, eat a dick
Man Down!

[Verse 3] Madchild
Yeah
Devilish and evil
Rebel with the ego
Ghost Riding dawg, whip it like I'm Devo
Every crazy fucker that you met, that's my people
Watching girls in ladies locker rooms through a peephole
Acid in my blood, gasoline in my cerebral
Flying over rappers like I'm Evel Knievel
Make these other rappers look feeble
Silver Tongue Devil, Super Beast is now the sequel
Keep trying but they'll never be my equal
When I was young I was dark and deceitful
Naturally Smash em', tactical assassin
Fuck the mainstream, this is actually passion
Fuck a turf war, hotter than the earth's core
Manages a weed smoking smurf on a surfboard
Not trying to say that he is smaller than me
Cause actually he's a couple inches taller than me
Rottweiler when I [?] he's my mentor
He's the boss, you don't want to get sent for
Three things, that's love, trust and danger
For him I'll slice your throat with a cold rusty razor

[Hook] Demrick
My enemies
They want me all gone a long time ago
Niggas just don't see
That I don't give a fuck what they say
No games, we could all die today, OK (OK!)

Man Down!
Man Down!
Man Down!
Fuck you and your bitch, eat a dick
Man Down!
