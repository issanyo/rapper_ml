My voice is coming back now…

You can see it’s permanent, I was born to terminate
Raising up the murder rate, ripping out your vertebrae
Different I’m magnificent I’m skipping while I'm wordilating
And little gangster Gerber baby spitting ever word is crazy
Half-author half-? bad posture
Little Godzilla, little King Kong with the ping pong paddle
Mad cause they be rattling my cage, never battling on stage
They know that’s a bad mistake

Cause I’m a cannibal, I’m Hannibal, I’m happy to deface
Plus I hold this little racket just to smack them back in place
I was out in outerspace sitting with the pouty face
Not surfing, had to turf it, sick of how the powder taste
Now that about explains it, I was painfully erased
Then I bowed my head in shame and I was thankfully embraced
Can’t thank my fans my enough, I got an army that is ready
2011 that’ll be your Armageddon
When the smoke clears (smoke clears) we will be in Heaven
And yes we on the right track, we some living legends that
Everywhere I go I’m always seeing 57s
For the last four years, I promise never to forget it
For these spellbound hellhounds every head gets severed
And I am held down tight by a family concept
See yeah damn right keep my vanity on check
My vanity in check, I confidently stomp on these insects
