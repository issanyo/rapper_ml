[Verse 1]

Feeling like a man who can't escape (Crash Landing, fuck)
Standin' on the planet of the Apes
Found me as a phantom with the cape
At a bus stop bench with the [?] can of pain
Started out a brave white falcon, quite something
You could hear the angels singing and the gold trumpets
Some how lost my way, no compass
Now i'm older lonely and no comfort
Bodies on the piece but he won't dump it
So complex making up my own contests
Dime and destiny has not been sculpted
So I'm standin' in the mirror and I'm staring at the culprit
Younger me lookin' at a sold out bathing ape
Reason I ain't dead, cause my tongue is like a razor blade
Voices in my head, laughing at my ugly ways
Eyes teared up as I hear em sing amazing grace
All I want to do is write rhymes and watch movies
Keep my doors locked and these lines fly through me
When the rent ain't payed apartments seem roomy
And my heart like my art come back dark and gloomy
You don't wanna feel the terror in Mad's shoes
Everyone that called become the bearer of bad news
Used to walk around like "Son you can't touch us"
Now every time I fall loved ones become crutches
Loved ones become crutches
Yo
These pills are bone crushers
Real fears that the children get fucked
So we get filled up, Kid spills his own guts
Suicidal Thoughts that filled up my head
The government, they got billions on debt
Civilians lives wrecked
Millions I've spent
Now the only things I own are the feelings I've left
There's a war goin' on inside, no man is safe from
Evil thoughts I thought I can't escape from
They say gods happiest when his children are at play
The suns up, I plan to live another day
Live another way
Give it up and say what I feel to the rhythm of a beat
Now the prisoner is free
And the prisoner is me
You get it?
