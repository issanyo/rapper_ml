[Sample]
There's no other feelin' on earth
I try to feel
But it hurts
I feel like a million miles away
Dealin' with this poison

[Intro]
It felt so far away
Lookin' back I've realized
I was just hidin' from the pain
Check, my head was constantly in the clouds
That's why I feel like I'm lost in space
Dealin' with this poison

[Verse 1]
Yo, I amm lucky just to be alive
'Cause I've pushed it to the limit
Now I've realized
Listen
I shouldn't even be here
So every night I thank God
That I can think and see clear
Lost in space and feelin' stranded
I was on a mothership
And I've finally landed
People that I love
They didn't leaved me stranded
So I'm back to finish what we started
How we planned it
'Cause after black magic
This will attract savage
Went from above average
Down to a drug addict
The devil on my shoulder with a pitchfork
Piss-poor
Thinking what the hell do I do this for?
But now I'm back
And I can kill on the freestyle
But you won't see my smile
'Cause I'm embarrassed of my teeth now
Takin' pills
And all the sugar did a number on them
And that just one of another other hundred problems
I'm an ugly goblin
I'm a dirty troll
Misguided angel with a bruised face and hurtin' soul
Sittin' in the corner
Staring out into the distance
Truly like a zombie
Hospital gown and wrist band
Listen

[Sample]
There's no other feelin' on earth
I try to feel
But it hurts
I feel like a million miles away
Dealin' with this poison

[Bridge]
It's nothin' like it
And that's the problem
I felt like I was a million miles away
I see clearly now, tho
Shit's real

[Verse 2]
Two years later
Now I write the second verse
I'm on the verge of blowing up on every record burst
I don't even think about some coke
And grabbin' opiates
I'm makin' money now from snappin' like a scorpion
Shows sober, now 'causelife is full of choices
My voice makes a girl's pussy moist as some oysters
And every night I like to find myself another groupie
Without a straw stuck up her nose
And fucking perfect boobies
That means that she ain't high on cocaine
Hard to have a conversation with a girl with no brain
Not that I really wanna talk a lot
I'm tired from the show
Just rub my back and make my cock a rock
Yeah, and suck it like you mean it
Pretend my dick's a big rock of crack
And you're fiendin'
Not that I've leaned to fuck for hours without drinking
Lookin' back
I don't even know what I was thinkin'
That some real shit

[Sample]
There's no other feelin' on earth
I try to feel
But it hurts
I feel like a million miles away
Dealin' with this poison

[Outro]
How many of you understand real pain
Livin' inside of real trap
A day to day trap
Everyday of your life
It's hard to explain
That's no other feelin' like it
I'm so thankful now I can finally see clear
I'm livin' life now
