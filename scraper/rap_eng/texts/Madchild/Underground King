[Verse 1]
Im a dangerous demented fuck in a truck dented up
Venting cause I'm bent from drinking caffeine in a venti cup
Walk in to a club look at me like: "You don't belong here"
They run away like I'm a motherfucking bomb scare
Harsh dark cartoon character
Walk through the park, sharp harpoon carrier
The kid's vicious like a pitbull terrier
Rip a subject from the Czech Republic to Bulgaria
Of course I'm a scary pirate with a fortune buried right beside
A mortuary, riding through an orchard on a horse and carriage
I left the gangs cause I am sick of all the conduct
They wanna kill me like I'm a fucking joker from La Honda
Lookin' for the light but I see trouble down yonder
Split personality, so I'm a double entendre
They tried to pull me down I severed the the knots
Now I'm a rebel; you can revel in these devilish thoughts

[Verse 2]
My mouth is full of fireworks like its July 4th
Life force, look at my reflection like a mind warp
Time warp, giant iron dwarf on an iron horse
Riding high up in the sky above a lying crying corpse
Let's decide, I'm a restless lion with the best design
Hard wired barbed wire fence, I'm electrifying
Mystifying, metal fists are flying from a chest of iron
Petrifying all you little insects, I'm pesticide
Just been fired for being the least admired, I'm a beast at fire
I make a golden reject teach, fulfilling each desire
Introverted hermit, turn myself into a true artist
These kids retarded, they just party and they spew garbage
You're not a real gangsta, you're not a crack dealer
Why the rest feel like they gotta rap like Drake or Mac Miller?
Not me! Rap immaculately! I'm spectacular. Dracula
I'm a fuckin' wacko that's a track killer

[Hook]
I'm the underground king, underground king, underground king
When I'm around something special happened every time
I'm the underground king, underground king, underground king
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
