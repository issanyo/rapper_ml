(Intro)
So many shows, good to be back in the studio
Shakin' the dust off
I got so much, so much fuckin' shit inside me
I gotta get out
Yo

(Hook)
It's kind of crazy when your hip-hop heroes
Do that flip-flop and find themselves hip-hop zeroes
So everyday I practice so I'm sharp as a arrow
Or a dart through your heart when it's dark, I'm a werewolf
I'm a crazy artist, might as well chop an earlobe
And I am here forever, hip-hop's Rob De Niro
Underground rapper, wearin' top notch apparel
In a 69 SS, drop-top Camaro!

(Verse)

Two thousand shows and I still belong to no-one
I'm Ronin with the Samurai sword a lone Shogun!
Fuck a mainstream rapper, that's still my slogan
Strange range broad as the shoulders of Hulk Hogan!
New storm comin' from my brain, tons of raw lightning
I write a song and then I send it off to Rob The Viking!
Back in the cave for the kids to think I'm not as frightening
It's time to let the monster out the cage for new excitement
A bag of bars, we gettin' tired of my conceited raps
I'm hearin' Merkules' name a lot, I needed that
Except for Snak the Ripper, I was the only one that's mangling
Focusin' on fierce words, stranglin' while rambling
I packed my bags and I moved to Los Angeles
Had to do somethin' because I couldn't fuckin' handle it..
Now we got SonReal, he's dope, makin' a lotta noise and
Aspect's back killin' beats that we can all enjoy

(Hook)
It's kind of crazy when your hip-hop heroes
Do that flip-flop and find themselves hip-hop zeroes
Everyday I practice so I'm sharp as a arrow
Or a dart through your heart when it's dark, I'm a werewolf

(Verse 2)
Yes, I'm still independent as fuck, meaning I freelance
Hopin' to get in touch again and make some songs with C-Lance
Don't know if I owe anyone a public apology
I was busy polishin' raps on tour demolishin'
When shit takes off you just do your best to keep up
Unfortunately I left a little mess I gotta sweep up
I'm like take a little break, go to sleep, what?!
When me and Pink Dragon broke up, that was a deep cut
It was the right thing, we didn't have that deep passion
But my ego took a hit, I took a real thrasin'
Me? I would have dealt with it forever cause I'm old fashioned
Wakin' up in the middle of the night, hot and cold flashes
Now it's just me and my dog, it's tranquility
Try'na stay single cause the stress, it was killin' me
Try'na find that hunger and focus that vocal villainry
And all I do is just hope that you folks is still feelin' me

(Hook)
It's kind of crazy when your hip-hop heroes
Do that flip-flop and find themselves hip-hop zeroes
So everyday I practice so I'm sharp as a arrow
Or a dart through your heart when it's dark, I'm a werewolf
I'm a crazy artist, might as well chop an earlobe
And I am here foreva, hip-hop's Rob De Niro
Underground rapper, rockin' top notch apparel
And a 69 SS, drop-top Camaro

(Verse 3)
My words are like weapons so I must be careful
An earful of my words can make a listener cheerful
And fill a person up full of strength that is fearful
I love God, so literally my lyrics can be spiritual!
Even though I sound sadistic when I go ballistic
I make songs for men and women, I'm not chauvinistic
I don't give a fuck about age, I'm tryin' to go the distance
No matter what, I'm makin' sure I spit like Souls of Mischief
93 'til Infinity, that is really me
Even tho I'm a certified OG like Willie D
I'm quite aware there's negativity from whispers
So I open up my mouth and hurl a lighting bolt at listeners

(Hook)
It's kind of crazy when your hip-hop heroes
Do that flip-flop and find themselves hip-hop zeroes
So everyday I practice so I'm sharp as a arrow
Or a dart through your heart when it's dark, I'm a werewolf
I'm a crazy artist, might as well chop an earlobe
And I am here forever, hip-hop's Rob De Niro
Underground rapper, rockin' top notch apparel
And a 69 SS, drop-top Camaro

(Outro)
What I meant in the first verse when I said
I had to move to Los Angeles cuz I couldn't fuckin' handle it
I'm not, I'm not disrespectin' my city
I will always be representin' Vancouver
I'm so proud to be from Vancouver
From Van City, I'm so proud to be Canadian
I just meant that I have to move
Somewhere where I'm surrounded by people that are better than me
I gotta push myself, break my own barriers
Push past my own walls and prove to myself
And to my fans and family
That I can do what I'm really really capable of
So I came to Los Angeles
I've got incredible people here surroundin' me supportin' me
Helpin' me, ah ah and that was the reason for it
I love bein' Canadian
I'm happy to be in LA, I'm thankful
And I I appreciate you guys
Without you guys I would be fuckin' nothin'
So thank you so much, God bless you
