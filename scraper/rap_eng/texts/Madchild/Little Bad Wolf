[Intro]
Show 'em what you got, kid

[Verse 1]
LL MadChild is hard as hell
Battle anybody; I don’t care if you tell
Yeah I excel; they all fail
That’s why MadChild rock the bells
Getting into fights ain't a problem of mine
Cause I always do my thing when it’s clobbering time
All I leave is a gloomy corpse
Cause I’m still on fire like the Human Torch
Forever Swollen Members but burn you solo
MadChild says 'flame on'; no homo
I’m a pyro; watch me spiral
Back into the ‘90s like De La and Hyro
I’m from Canada: an awful climate
And I rap like my brainwaves are off alignment
Yeah, I’m in the desert high on peyote
Eyes popping out like Wile E. Coyote

[Hook]
Knock-knock; they don’t wanna let me in
Not by the hairs on my chinny-chin-chin
Dress like a G; tattoos on my skin
Saying that I’m guilty of all seven sins
Knock-knock; they don’t wanna let me in
Trying to stop Mad from what I could have been
You can huff, you can puff, you can snag all my friends
But I’m Little, Bad Wolf: this is not the end

[Verse 2]
I tried to get into the States, they weren't having it
Going through my bag like a bunch of savages
Customs agent looking like he’s mad at me
Cause I got friends that look like Sons of Anarchy
Knew that I’m a rapper: guess he’s not a fan of me
Looking at me crazy; was purely insanity
Ten hours go by, not panicking
I just sat there still like a mannequin
I was laughing: they kept asking me what gang I’m in
Started being nicer cause I didn't use profanity
I thought what’s the point? I’ll be a gentleman
Instead of being an asshole pumped up on adrenaline
Thinking to myself 'I can’t believe I’m red-flagged
I love the States; how the fuck I’m gonna get back?'
It’s not like I’m smuggling drugs
All of this because I hang out with a couple of thugs?

[Hook]
