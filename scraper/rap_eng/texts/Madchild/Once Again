[Hook]
[Mad Child]: It might seem
[Moka Only]: Seems like I'm in love
[Ma]: Big mistake
[Mo]: But that's a big mistake
[Ma]: I'll just hang
[Mo]: Hanging for a while
[Ma]: Like your smile
[Mo]: Guess I like your smile
[Ma]: Here again
[Mo]: December's here again
[Ma]: Should I go?
[Mo]: I'll leave just tell me when
[Ma]: Feel no pain
[Mo]: I won't feel no pain, but let me love you once again

[Verse: Moka Only] + (Mad Child)
Now I would jump into this thing, with no pre-conceive
Idea is, I always thought me and she can be free
But I see it's not as easy as I once believe
The more I look at the alternative the harder to leave
(No more)
No more looking in your eyes
(Before)
No more staring into sky
(It was cool)
I only asked if I could stay
(No rules)
From December until May
(No more counting down the days)
(No more drifting into space0
(We're just living for today)
It occurred to feel this way

[Hook]

[Verse: Mad Child]
When we connected, we made an agreement
No strings attached, we were keeping it even
It was like "Take it or leave it, let's be casual"
Although we got lost in time, it was magical
But I'm not ready for this settling down talk again
A cat needs his space, trying to box me in
I need oxygen, let me get back into my thing
This was only supposed to be from winter 'til spring
I think it's time for us to end this
What chu call? Falling in love? I'm calling more than friendship
Got mixed feelings but I'll be alright
I'm out the door but let me stay just one more night

[Hook 2]
[Mad Child]: It might seem
[Moka Only]: Seems like I'm in love
[Ma]: On the surface
[Mo]: But that's a big mistake
[Ma]: What's the purpose?
[Mo]: Hanging for a while
[Mo]: Guess I like your smile
[Ma]: Here again
[Mo]: December's here again
[Ma]: Is it too long?
[Mo]: I'll leave just tell me when
[Ma]: Should I move on?
[Mo]: I won't feel no pain, but let me love you once again

[Outro: Moka Only]
Let me love you once again (let me love you once again)
Seems like I'm in love, so let me love you once again
