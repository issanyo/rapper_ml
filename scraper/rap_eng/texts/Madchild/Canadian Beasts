[Verse 1: Swisha T]
Ye you noticed it, I'm a flowisist, you ain't as cold as this
My orbit is, just so glorious, I feel like Morpheus
I'm sorry bitch, but I'm not into you, I just got into you
Got intimate, but now I'm impotent so I'm out to kicking it
I'm sick of this so quit your blabbering, get the [?]
What's happening, you ripped the [?] you fucking scavenger
Imagine that, I wasn't a rapper would you even call
They claim to love me, but I swear they don't know me at all
And all these critics in my city wanna see me fall
Saying that they know me well, but we don't speak at all
We might've met, but the fact of the matter is that I don't owe you anything
Shut the fuck up you little bitch ass, get back with the riff raff
Sit back grab a six pack, some Backwoods or Zig-Zags
Whatever that get up my business
You motherfuckers got me plotting to finish you
Stick a blade inside your frame then ask you what has got into you

[Hook]
I see they wanna see me fall
Got me plotting to finish you
I'm a motherfucking problem
I'm a Canadian beast
I see they wanna see me fall
Got me plotting to finish you
I'm a motherfucking problem
I'm a Canadian beast

[Verse 2: Madchild]
Pour petroleum, a linoleum, stand on a podium and cause pandemonium, spittin' nitrate and sodium
Kids so felonious, tails are a farce
Lot of rappers in my country but the real ones are sparse
I'm a sick pitbull, you're a cocker spaniel
Ask Charron, I'm his evil fucking doppelg√§nger
Blood is boiling from insanity and awkward anger
I get it in with good producers, make a proper banger
Don't get me started with these battle rappers
Afraid to ride a fucking beat next to their shadowcaster
Scientific with this shit, I'm an atom blaster
You're just a bad example, branch you like a cattle rancher
Walk into a room, these other rappers don't look
I beat their ass like a cop with a phonebook
Cocky motherfucker with a young dude's lip
Sharp as young Chip-Fu
With a kung fu grip

[Hook]
I see they wanna see me fall
Got me plotting to finish you
I'm a motherfucking problem
I'm a Canadian beast
I see they wanna see me fall
Got me plotting to finish you
I'm a motherfucking problem
I'm a Canadian beast

[Verse 3: Charron]
Ruthless, got the Eazy-E fucking blueprint
Too sick, siamese twins with the fluspi
Mucus, beat to beat the palm now it's useless
Wanna play dirty, pussy bitch you wouldn't do shit
You've been, listening to Canada's best
So big I get hate mail from Pamela's chest
Shadow of death, pay from reality checks
I'm from real life Johnny Depp's [?]
[?] I'm a schizo, rebuttal king thinking of a couple things
Means I'm going into flip mode
Bust a rhyme till the cyph is crushed
This ain't a clean song so I can cuss
Rappers are thinking of my lines too much
Kid dynamite with mics, it's Tyson punch
Ain't no more to tongue like a horse
If I kill myself, Peter will pour some fucking blood on my corpse

[Hook]
I see they wanna see me fall
Got me plotting to finish you
I'm a motherfucking problem
I'm a Canadian beast
I see they wanna see me fall
Got me plotting to finish you
I'm a motherfucking problem
I'm a Canadian beast

[Outro]
Everybody wanna talk about the money they make
But nobody wanna say what's real
You can talk about your clothes and the car you drive
But you ain't givin' us nothin' to feel
Everybody wanna talk about the money they make
But nobody wanna say what's real
You can talk about your clothes and the car you drive
But you ain't givin' us nothin' to feel
