[Madchild]
Yeah
Takin it easy right now
Not as concerned with the outside world

[Verse 1] Madchild

I'm sittin rockin back and forth
I've been thinkin I've been back and forth
Across the country on these rappin tours
And I got what I was askin for
My manager calls me but I can't no more
Because it will cause me damage that's for sure
I gotta take a break
G understand
Made a mil but feel just like a hundred grand
And that ain't bad
And I ain't mad
And I'll be back
And now it's overalls and cowboy hats
Ben Harper, James Tayler, Ben Taylor, Jack Johnson, Bob Marley and the Wailers
Incense burnin' watch the wheels turnin'
As time goes by I'm learnin
Not so concerned with the club scene
I like to stay home to me that shits lovely
Write and watch movies in front of the fire
I'll be back for the grind but for now I'm retired

[Hook] Moka Only

I'm sitting on the front porch
Just waiting for the moment to shine
I've been sitting here for a long while
Just wasting all my precious time

[Verse 2] Moka Only

I'm just sitting rockin side to side
Trying to let my inside decide
What I want to keep inside my life
If it ain't nice I ain't trying to hear nobody's advice
Maybe in a minute but for now alright
They can take it how they want because I do it how I like
And that goes for the both of us
It justs two of us sunday drivin
[?] from dust
Cause we're doing this miracle lab
Layin back in my pad rockin stereo lab
I got plans that I carry around
And none of this shit sounds very profound but yo
I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
Yeah I slow down so I can gather the power
Because you can't smell the roses at 90 miles per hour

[Hook x2] Moka Only

I'm sitting on the front porch
Just waiting for the moment to shine
I've been sitting here for a long while
Just wasting all my precious time
