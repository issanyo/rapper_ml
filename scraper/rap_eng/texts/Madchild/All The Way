[Hook]
I be blazing night and day
Smoking my whole life away
At least that’s what my momma say
For her I throw it all the way
All I know is all the way
Fall like all the way in this heyday
Hustle for my payday
Haters yelling mayday
Weighing up on my wavelength

I ain’t never coming down
Got beats from the pound
Weed by the pound
Bitch, you come around
I ain’t never coming down
Got beats from the pound
Weed by the pound
Bitch, you come around
You want to be down with it
You want to be down with it
You want to be down with it

[Verse 1] Demrick
This speed ‘till I d-i-e
Yeah they got beef, but it ain’t that deep
Niggas got dreams but I just can’t sleep
You singing the police like do-re-mi
That’s the type of shit that I just can’t see
Eyes for a shot like an [?]
Going up gang, better know my team
Baxwar, niggas don’t want war ‘cause it’s all I need
(You want to be down with it)
Let me show you the way, roll you a J, keep my mind on pay
Like Big Bird say, he did it all in a day, put it all in the paint
Did it all my way
All I know is I’m on my toes
Haters are still trying to cross my road
Let me light my blunt and blow my smoke

[Hook]
I be blazing night and day
Smoking my whole life away
At least that’s what my momma say
For her I throw it all the way
All I know is all the way
Fall like all the way in this heyday
Hustle for my payday
Haters yelling mayday
Weighing up on my wavelength

I ain’t never coming down
Got beats from the pound
Weed by the pound
Bitch, you come around
I ain’t never coming down
Got beats from the pound
Weed by the pound
Bitch, you come around
You want to be down with it
You want to be down with it
You want to be down with it

[Verse 2] Madchild
Bitch you get me rock hard
Love to make that pussy wet
Perfect ass, bending over in that little Stüssy dress
Super villain with the cape
Leave me in a crazy state
Green-eyed half Asian baby rocking Bathing Ape
You keep it light, to live with me is like a rattlesnake
I’m a gladiator with the angry alligator’s traits
Known for being a vicious fucking chatterbox on battle breaks
Shadowbox with Satan, I’m a blatant crazy scatterbrain
Paranoid schizophrenic, sick lieutenant, shit’s authentic
I sit and do my pennants. Spread it like an epidemic
Kid’s a menace. I guess my head it gets a bit demented
See my bitch and pitch my tent
My dick gets hard as thick cement is

[Verse 3] Futuristic
Yo
I guess I smoke
One hit then I choke
The kid’s high
Bad bitch taking me home
She really want to bone
That make her a bitch right?
You know, female dog
I ain’t never been the kiss type
When them jeans come off
You know she want the dick right?
I’m a plumber give her thick pipe
Oh
Back in the day they used to hate on me
I’m always trying to eat, I got these little niggas weight on me
I’m patiently climbing the ladders, someone hold the legs for me
I’m making timeless music, ain’t no expiration date on me..
And I’m probably drunk
Wait
And I’m probably too it
It’s Futuristic, Futuristic, said it twice in case you miss it. To these bitches is missing, I had to blaze it

[Hook]
I be blazing night and day
Smoking my whole life away
At least that’s what my momma say
For her I throw it all the way
All I know is all the way
Fall like all the way in this heyday
Hustle for my payday
Haters yelling mayday
Weighing up on my wavelength

I ain’t never coming down
Got beats from the pound
Weed by the pound
Bitch, you come around
I ain’t never coming down
Got beats from the pound
Weed by the pound
Bitch, you come around
You want to be down with it
You want to be down with it
You want to be down with it
