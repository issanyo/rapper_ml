It's a throwback
Lootpack
(Cause when I'm on da mic I like to speak freely)

[Intro]
Now when Madchild walks before Madchild looks
I swear to God I should be dead from all the pills I took
But I'll be okay
(Cause when I'm on da mic I like to speak freely)

[Verse 1]
Raise your hands if you're going insane
If you're feeling so depressed you wanna blow out your brains
And you've been to darker places you won't try to explain
But still you try to keep it moving then we're probably the same
I used to get high like trucks on lift kits
Then I woke up and I said fuck this shit
I made a promise to myself, Mad rip shit
And slide through your verse like the Tokyo Drift kid
From being on the doctor's on pills like please help me
To being on the hospital floor like please kill me
And I ain't scared of dying except there's nothing to inherit
And I owe lots of people money including my parents
I'm trying signal right but I have mental interference
Cause I got inner-demons that are screaming out my lyrics
And I'm new to this new game where kids all talk shit
That's why I'm writing rhymes that even they can't fuck with
Let me do a show, let me catch somebody chuckle
I won't stop until my hands hurt and I got bloody knuckles
Then I'll take his girl and turn that boy into a cuckold
To tell the truth, I ain't fucking with them suck hoes

[Hook]
Now when Madchild walks before Madchild looks
I swear to God I should be dead from all the pills I took
But I'll be okay
(Cause when I'm on da mic I like to speak freely)

And when Madchild talks before Madchild thinks
I swear that I am going crazy, I should see a shrink
But I'll be okay
(Cause when I'm on da mic I like to speak freely)

[Verse 2]
Welcome to Jamrock where kids dress like Urkel they and they dance to spank rock
Don't they know that Madchild fly like Hancock
I'm from Vancouver where the guns go bang bro
Told you that it's Swollen Members holmes, we can't stop
I'm dangerous like Bangkok
All these little rappers coming fresh out the sandbox
Life a little crazy for me now that I'm bankrupt
But misguided angel breaking out of his handcuffs
Shane felt pain like acid rain drops
So Shane popped pills that'll make your brain rot
Quit now I'm back conquering like Genghis
Calm on tour fucking whores like Bang Bus

[Hook]

Now when Madchild walks before Madchild looks
I swear to God I should be dead from all the pills I took
But I'll be okay
(Cause when I'm on da mic I like to speak freely)

And when Madchild talks before Madchild thinks
I swear that I am going crazy, I should see a shrink
But I'll be okay
(Cause when I'm on da mic I like to speak freely)

[Verse 3]
Now tell me who should take the title
Rocking steady since the b-boy summits were in tribal
Now it's all about survival (Cause when I'm on da mic I like to speak freely)
Okay you won't have a clue on what I'm doin' to a rival
Thought I was a shoe-in but I'm blue and sitting idle
I was super stupid now recouping loot is vital
And I'm just trying to break a broken group of ruined idols
Now call me Mr. Suicidal
Ruthless for a writer rapper with the human spider
I'm the Silver Surfer, stressed so I'm a Night Owl
Definite depression so my loft is now a hideout
It's bright out, keep the shades down and the doors locked
Fort Knox, keep the floor mopped, I'm a warlock
Trying to keep a secret while I'm sneaking out the door cause
People might be sleeping but I'm freaking out for more drugs
Aye yo I'm set on repeat rocking undefeated but it's dead up defeat
White wifebeater in a white wifebeater but I don't wear tight jeans or bright Nikes either
You don't like my style? I don't like yours either
Dating Asian girls, they got white boy fever
Instead of beaking while I'm tweaking out I'm looking for a beacon
And speaking while I'm deeking out the Devil on the weekends
