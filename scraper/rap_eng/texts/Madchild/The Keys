Intro: Some nights when i get bored, I like to go out to bars and play the piano, take some shots of whisky, smoke a cigarette, and fuck and rock the house

Verse: (Mad Child) OK,  Spidey sense is tingling, I'm intense with mingling,worlds a crazy circus but were brothers like the wringlings, chew these rappers up and spit em out like i'm from Wrigley's, sorta like a hoarder but i'm shorter than a pigmy, just cause i'm from Canada don't mean i live in igloos, soon as i'm aloud back in the states i will be big news, i'm getting old but still in line, like it was last call, I'm gettin colder with these lines and i got brass balls, seems like being a pussy is in style, and wearing flouresent, i'm a dwarf more aggressive with a warped message, walking through a cavern with a torch lit, rather be an underground rapper then full of horse shit,i chop these rappers up and eat em like slaw salad, this is raw talent, still a little off balance,i am cold as ice spitting vocal poltergeist listen to the words i'm saying close i'm giving bold advice

Chorus: (Crazy Town) You really don't know what it means
When I hand you the keys, You overlooking like it's overhead
It's sure to bring you down on your knees, Gonna take it when we give it, Cause we gunnin like we bobafett

Real I've always been, real I'll always be
So real in fact my haters even respect me

You really don't know what it means when I hand you the keys
When I hand you the keys


Second Verse: (Shifty) I'm crazy c crazy crazy ,this jacket can't restrain me, insane in the brain they label me when i was just a baby, playing with chains, skulls and spikes, the chain go on the bike, the bikes going with me and we can go if you like

Masked with the hoodies in the hood he taking goodies door to door like a girl scout

Daily Panickin, a mannequin, they say the dark brought him, b born on the floor but they call it rock bottom

Chorus: (Crazy Town) You really don't know what it means
When I hand you the keys, You overlooking like it's overhead
It's sure to bring you down on your knees, Gonna take it when we give it, Cause we gunnin like we bobafett

Real I've always been, real I'll always be
So real in fact my haters even respect me

You really don't know what it means when I hand you the keys
When I hand you the keys

So real in fact my haters even respect me

You really don't know what it means when I hand you the keys
