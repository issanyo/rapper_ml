[Hook x3]
[Black Thought (Sampled from The Roots Don't Say Nuthin)]
I'll still be on the grind
When it all collapse
And if it’s mine
Word is bond
I'mma take it right back

[Moka Only]
I'm on the grind
Time to go for mine
We still climb
Feelin' alive
Flowing line for line
It go

[Black Thought (Sampled from The Roots Don't Say Nuthin)]
I'll still be on the grind
When it all collapse
And if it’s mine
Word is bond
I'mma take it right back

[Moka Only]
I'm on the grind
Time to go for mine
We still climb
Feelin' alive
Flowing line for line

[Prevail]
Yo, we trail blazing
Prevail's amazing
Raisin' the bar
For fame and fortune
Is the fortunate part
Never a guarantee
To where we'll be
When time passes on
One of us is passive aggressive
The others mad calm
Combine a hundred rhymes
Swollen Members Black Magic
Tour bus the pure rush
This album is a classic
Cuz legend has it
The veteran of letters is drastic
An energetic performance
And the chorus fantastic

[Mad Child]
Stole from the soul
Of the misguided angel
I reach up touch the sun
And the rainfall
But there's no rainbow
People are painful
Evil and angry, abused and afraid
We all get confused
By the moves that we made
So I mend broken heart
Make art and pray
From the start of the day
To the end of the evening
Make life count
Thank God that I'm breathing

[Hook]

[Prevail]
Yo, the road to glory
Is the story of strength
The glorious road warriors
We travel the length
We've seen high times, low tides
Waves that break
We keep eyes open
Heads up, no mistakes
Self disciplined
Listenin to voices in my head
One choice keep workin it
It's a promise not a threat
Go and get what we set out
To do in the first place
Divide and conquer
With the intensity of earthquake

[Mad Child]
Demonize day dream
Wander alone
Go, not normal
I'm crazy and stoned
Psychopath
Don't come close to my face
Got bad reputation
And social disgrace
I don't hate you
Rap 'til my face blue
You kill time
I climb 'til I break through
Quietly suffering
Draw from the pain
Still something out there
That's calling my name

[Hook]
