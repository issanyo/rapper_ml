[Hook 1] Prevail
Battle Axe Warriors
We come in right and exact, x-acto blade
Your main frame and leave you bleeding out back
And leave the motherfucking blood suckers feeding on that
If you believe in real rap then you should see us attack
Warriors!

[Verse 1] Madchild

I'm playing puff the magic dragon
I'm a fucking savage
.357 magnum just above the upper cabinet
Madchild, It's impossible to stop the cycle
I'm shooting off of the mouth till i'm a talking rifle
I spit harsh statements in depth dark basements
And hand carve names into Mad's arm wasted
Madchild, I'm a landmark face it
Land shark
Quick to chomp a vanguards placement
Find that I'm as stunning as shit kid
I'm running with misfits and dummies
Spitting cunning linguistics
A lot of days were sunny, ya, but money, we missed it
Now I shit kicked my boys to drink honey and liquid
Sicker than a pack of pitbulls attacking a victim
Cracking his ligaments while lying on his back at a picnic
I rip shit dipshit. Madchild's not a figment
Of your imagination
Eat a bucket of pig shit
I'm sick of all the riffraff
I'm a fucking big daff
Kick back while I throw up on a sick track
Had a habit but I stopped it through some opiates
Now it's impossible to beat the kid like Morpheus
These orphans are proportionate. Fortunately torturous
Morphing into something more appropriately fortunate
Sick looters with sick shooters and rubber pig masks
Super Beast, walk among the wounded
Better think fast

[Verse 2] A-O

Think fast, before was to late
I been up at 4 in the morning sippin' kool aid
Ya I could give fuck what you say
God know I'm fly like a blue jay
But, never been to Toronto
Never been to Chicago
But I know my flow is dope like the shit they smoke in Colorado
Ya, I'm the god like Apollo
And my shadow is the only thing I follow
Unless I see a model
Unless she poppin' bottles
Unless we in the back of McDonald's eatin' tacos
Ha ha I'm lovin' it
Now i'm high on life
I used to be high on some other shit
Thought it was plain Mary Jane but her angel wings was dusty
No wonder they don't trust me
I fucked up but they still wanna fuck me
I met a love but they still tryna duck me
Don't fuckin' touch me, I'm hot like inferno
Shot through a worm hole with a black fox fur coat
Drunk off a [?] herbs burnin'
I'm the first person that will curse verses
Like a goat
I can float whenever I write a note
I can [?] with the fire flow
I was born a warrior
You know how the story goes

[Hook 2] Prevail
