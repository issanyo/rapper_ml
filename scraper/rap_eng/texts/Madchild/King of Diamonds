[Verse 1: Prevail]
Fahrenheit life support, bear in mind the mic and cord
And everything around it sounded off, I came to round it off
To higher decibel levels
I set the precedent, my energy's very incredible
Yet barely accessible
By the lame and tame and animals like lions and tigers and bears
Locked up in cages and the bite has been trying for years
All they got is some lighters, they round us some smoke and some mirrors
It’s like illusionists versus the true prestigious
The new elitists will feed us, now before I start the carnage
Will leave you bleeding out and calling for nurses and doctors
Assistant neurosurgeons, in the distance this is certain
Bright light hallway, corridor, choose a door
Handle turn your handle, burn or freeze upon contact
Dawn tread the night spawn, explode upon impact
Slow your roll, get back, or get burnt like jet pack
A real rocknrolla, Rollin Stone that came in jet black

[Hook: Prevail]
Come and place your bet on the set
The 3 men threat, what you see is what you get
Come and place your bet on the set
The 3 men threat, what you see is what you get
The 3 men threat, what you see is what you get
Come and place your bet on the set
The 3 men threat, what you see is what you get

[Verse 2: Mad Child]
I’m fucking torturous, kinda like an orphan it's unfortunate
I became so lonely didn’t even had an orphanage
Then I found out I could flex on beats like a contortionist
But now I’m back to make this game pay like an extortionist
I kill these kids like an abortion then go sport fishin'
You best abort mission, or you’ll need a mortician
I’m a warped magician, got a heart condition
But once I start milition, you'll be in a hard position
See the line curvatures, I’m a rhyme furbisher
We like fine furniture
I like japanese toys, clothes and street art
And I don’t fuck hoes no more, I got a sweetheart
I get on stage and I start rappin' like a retard
Hipster killing zombie, I will bite you through your leotard
Poisonous and powerful primate that rhyme great, iron snake
Heavy metal raps that define fate
Pound you to the ground like I’m a human meat grinder
Heat breather, that pack a meat cleaver

[Hook]
