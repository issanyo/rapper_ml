(Chorus)
Born in fire, built in this empire
Can't get no higher or stop my desire
Dark riders, we be pulling all nighters
Never see us perspire, built in this empire
Born in fire, built in this empire
Can't get no higher or stop my desire
Dark riders, we be pulling all nighters
Never see us perspire, built in this empire

[Mad Child]
Go to the launch, blow the fuck out the insubordinate
Roll a quarter in the plant can't change the co-ordinates
Encore threatened by force past the limit
Mutilate the meak, terrorize the timid
Murder in a minute then it's mission accomplished
Corner the confused than stomp with my accomplice
Figurously weak, disfigure at random
Still remain the most fame in this chain of commandments
Branded as the beast this is Mad Child unleashed
God bless the mastepiece once sinner within a peace
Release the hell cell with a demented twist
Bet with the unscented this inventiveness
Pay dues man, come on, I spent the rent on this
Reap the world with these experimentalists
No time for gentleness, I got moves to make
Have fun riding the same bus that I used to take
Chemical weapons specialist is here to defuse
The shit you called the bomb because of yesterdays news

(Chorus)
Born in fire buit in this empire
Can't get no higher or stop my desire
Dark riders, we be pulling all nighters
Never see us perspire, built in this empire
Born in fire, built in this empire
Can't get no higher or stop my desire
Dark riders, we be pulling all nighters
Never see us perspire, built in this empire

[Prevail]
The superficial, meta-morphing their bodies to pixel
Trying to lose me cause they know I go for gristle
This will eventually run it's natural course
And the weasels who ran stand in the house of the lords
Us, they cannonball crushing misguided angel
Bent on performance and the symbol of our label
It's simple, the cradle to the grave and so forth
You heard of those speaches by those breaching the default
Sea salt, eye of newt, Horn of Bison
I sworn allengiance to the league of striking lightning
We fall when we choose and confuse you with patterns
The legend of the two who induced you like dragons
We swipe, like swooping gargoyles of St. Catharine
I'm taking parts apart of parts unimagined
It happens, when lacking a variety of guidance
The good ones die young and dive into the silence

(Chorus)
Born in fire, built in this empire
Can't get no higher or stop my desire
Dark riders, we be pulling all nighters
Never see us perspire, built in this empire
Born in fire, built in this empire
Can't get no higher or stop my desire
Dark riders, we be pulling all nighters
Never see us perspire, built in this empire

[Prevail]
The torment, of getting caught up in a moment
And having to be on the recieving end of my orbit
This axis, acts this light and dark passage
And guides me past the sticks, river floating caskets
Come on and collapsing lungs and charcoal tablets
The howling wolf pack who dwells in echoing madness
Caged driven rage living in veins of access
Incase the driven and icisions are the progress

[Mad Child]
Check the flip side of the corn, dark riders perform
Words rip through your skull, tucked inside of the storm
It's hard to hide if you're warm, blooded withstands heat
Predators that feed off flesh to make ends meet
Isn't guarenteed, what, death is instantanious
Mercilessly, we name the miscellanious
Conquer all my challenges by reaching within
Then Mad Child leaves with the screetch of the wind

(Chorus)
Born in fire, built in this empire
Can't get no higher or stop my desire
Dark riders, we be pulling all nighters
Never see us perspire, built in this empire
Born in fire, built in this empire
Can't get no higher or stop my desire
Dark riders, we be pulling all nighters
Never see us perspire, built in this empire
