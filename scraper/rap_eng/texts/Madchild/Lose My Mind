[Intro: Madchild]
You can't say I didn't work on this one

[Verse 1: Madchild]
Yo, Now that I'm sober surprises are over
But the tribe full of overly rivalrous ogres
A tiger in loafers with drive of a chauffeur
All my real warriors survival of soldiers!
Biceps and shoulders in sizes of boulders
Ice running through my veins, my eyes even colder
I like a bitch with a bangin' ass and fatty tissue
Small waist perfect tits and some daddy issues!
I got a new bitch south salvadorian
Ridin' shotgun in this new black DeLorean
It's back to the future, I don't act accordingly
I snatch words out of the air and think distortedly!
A real man grabs his testicles often
I'mma be cool forever like I'm Christopher Walken!
I think you get the gist to my talking
I'm a falcon flipping shit like I'm a mystical dolphin!

[Hook: Madchild]
This is not a good time to lose my mind
This ain't a good time to fall behind
Pick up the pieces one more try
I dont think this is time for me to say goodbye
This is not a good time to lose my mind
It's not a good time to fall behind
Pick up the pieces one more try
I don't think this is time for me to say goodbye


[Verse 2: Madchild]
Sometimes doing cameo is a difficult endorsement
Especially when my verses are a biblical proportion
I'm extraordinary you are extra ordinary
Try to drop a weight on my shoulders but still got more to carry
These fuckboys asking me to pass a torch I carry?
Lost souls like a tortured scary mortuary
More the merrier, son em' like some orphan fairies
That's a new lamborghini to a horse and carriage
It's embarrassing my passion it is bone deep
A bright green eyed white wolf to this clone sheep
Yeah it's true if you don't work you don't eat
But I'm doing more than eating now, so don't sleep!
Listen buddy could get messy cause I mangle
Not a rapper, i'm a cocky little vessel full of anger!
Superiority makes me a desolate stranger
Plus I'm crazy motherfucker like I'm touched by the angels!

[Hook: Madchild]
This is not a good time to lose my mind
This ain't a good time to fall behind
Pick up the pieces one more try
I dont think this is time for me to say goodbye
This ain't a good time to lose my mind
This ain't a good time to fall behind
Pick up the pieces one more try
I don't think this is time for me to say goodbye

[Verse 3: JD Era]
Look I was born off my rocker with fangs and a chopper
Found in the youth doin' laps and some vodka
Now I'm grown up hiding guns in a locker
Mask and some keys, it's the phantom of the opera
Blunt smokin', I'm potent and I mean [?]
Your skull closin' if I flex like Hulk Hogan
Nose broken if I feel that you provoking
In slow motion Commentary by Joe Rogan
You can't cage what you can't gage
You ever seen a psychopath on a rampage?
I catch a rapper in the cut like a band-aid
Then push his head into a motherfucking fan blade. chop it up
Switch flows, I'm rollin' with sicko's
I'm from the sixty shows, I'm on a mission, doe
I mean I poisoned the princess and slaughtered the king
A hundred thousand warriors swarmin' at the sound of a ring, Driiingg

[Hook: Madchild]
This is not a good time to lose my mind
This ain't a good time to fall behind
Pick up the pieces one more try
I dont think this is time for me to say goodbye
This ain't a good time to lose my mind
This ain't a good time to fall behind
Pick up the pieces one more try
I don't think this is time for me to say goodbye
