[Verse 1] Prevail
I’m fully charged, I’ll pull you apart like a shock of electrostatic
My talks erratic. Shatter the melodramatic faster than massive panic
My views on life are slanted, twisted, torn, constricted. Some can’t handle it
The gifted dominant, prominent, opulent, immaculate passionate [?]
The cause and effect of a positive step that’ll move in the right direction
My [?] on the next full moon might [?] cause infection
And have you tearing through the room like a werewolf in London
The air to a throne, no known home or whereabouts. Where does he come from?
The land of the lost
These thoughts won’t stop ‘til the action drops
The maniac’s back. This mantic track is backed by the hands of DJ Swamp

[Verse 2] Madchild
Death before dishonour, breath fire, I’m a prying force
Madchild flying through the desert on an iron horse
Adrenaline rush, the devil rests
Floating on a surface that changes with every step
Infamous death head, 55 East End
Satisfy my hunger as I feast in the [?] den
Fabulous terror. Mastered five of the seven deadly sins that I’m aware of
It’s unbearable
The ultimate culprit, I’m terrible
Multiple personalities, it doesn’t matter where I go
Self awareness, terrified of facing it
Merciless but still worship God, not atheist

[Verse 3]
[Prevail]
I can kill it [?]
Confident use soliloquy
Guaranteed authenticity
The ministry of misery

[Madchild]
The descendants of vengeance
The penalties are endless
Pretenders will bow to the underworld defenders
He cowardice are powerless. Devour them like mountainous terrain
Annihilist but finalist of fame

[Prevail]
Creetons and heathens, I’ll leave them without the air they’re breathing
Even thought they feel that they’re dealing with a man of reason

[Madchild]
Burning with the sternness and severity of discipline

[Prevail]
Various areas that turn into a furnace of nitroglycerin
Unequivocal pinnacles of an original pivotal process
Blessed with the indivisible rituals of an unstoppable progress
