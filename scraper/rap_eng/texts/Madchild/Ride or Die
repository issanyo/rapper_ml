[Verse 1:]
Ride or die I'm a ride till I'm gone
No regards for the law get it on [I get it popping]
I ride for mine and I ride for the cause
I go hard for ma dogs even if I gotta see a coffin
Plan to die plan to rise like the apes
Going ape shit gorilla throwing feces in their face
Should wear a fucking cape cause I'm Wayne, I'm a superhero
Escape my fate, fuck police fuck your stupid barrel
I'm riding drunk with ma hands on the pump
Couple bodies in the trunk on the way to get dumped
Smelling like a skunk like I'm Pepe Le Pew
On my way to go and score like what Gretzky would do
And I'm packing 2 nines and i'm too fine
And in due time i'll be living large
And when i'm in the line in the sky i'm hitting God
For giving the world too many frauds and not enough riders
Too many blood sucking bitches not enough spiders

[Chorus:]
Yo the spotlight is mine it ain't his no more
Gimme the mic so I can take it away [way]
Now get up off your ass like yo seats hot
Cause i'm rough rider
Yo the spotlight is mine it ain't his no more
Gimme the mic so I can take it away [way]
Now get up off your ass like yo seats hot
Cause i'm rough rider

[Verse 2:]
Ride or die mother fucker I will not stop
Chrome engine muscle car with the drop top
Hit the highway ima do it my way
Frank Sinatra in this bitch make you vibrate
I don't laugh about bitches wearing red bottoms
I talk about warlords, pirates and dead goblins
Little monster I am banned from America
Not that i'm a problem i'm a bad judge of character
Samurai sword, damn, am I bored, hammer like Thor
Cameras on tour, grammar hardcore
Little monster hashtags smash bags
Cut these little bitches up and put them in a trash bag
I'm a get the last laugh hit you with that crack sound
Bend them to the wind and then I blend into the background
Blackout match up killing them with snow goons
Pull a butcher knife and blood gets splattered round the whole room
Blockwise backs war that's the entire empire
Dragon gang poison in my pen fire
Sick white boy style meticulous but still got constituents
Stoned off obituates
Madchild is vicious bitch box full of kilowatts
Float like a butterfly sting like a killer wasp
I was in the belly of the beast until he vomited
Everybody got a brain but mine there's something wrong with it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Ayo ma third eye open smoking meditating
Oceans of medication floating and levitating
A ghost woulda had a amen roast you for preparation
And then eat you alive your soul end up dead in the matrix
Picture me rolling with swollen I see no limitation
I see no invitation on ma own I will make it
Throne's  for the taking the flow is amazing
I'm patient I know it's a race since I been born I been chasing
Spit a storm in your face and you know it pours when it's raining
Rip a hole let's go page out and kick a scorpio statement
Too many rappers and they boys think they famous
End up dead corpse in a basement
Poletti used swords to erase them
I come hard like the core of the pavement, oral persuasion
Like the way I rap she hits the floor like she's wasted
It's ride or die and I'm rolling Jamaican no filtration in what I'm saying
The future insane Shane in the making
My stage name isn't changing same name which was gave
When I came claiming the game and slayed lames with the ages
[It's Pow-letti] racing through phrases like Andretti
Yo man ready to plan heavy the clan deadly

[Chorus]
