[Madchild]
Yo it took 5 minutes now I call you baby
Both fucked up but we still good crazy
Got boyfriends so our love's like maybe
Ro dawg ask if we mis behaving
You seem like you gotta a couple screws loose too
We just met and I'm afraid one day I might lose you
Somethin cornered in my head like what am I gon' do
This is wrong but if you want me you know I'll come through
Often you walkin in high heels and stalkings
See dollar signs in your eyes when your talkin
But I know there's another side, face me, embrace me
I need you, I need to feed till I breathe you
And you know soon we both gon have to make a decision
Feel bad, he's got to go, but he's not takin you with him
Till then, just promise me that you won't cry
I'll meet you in your dreams, first we'll talk till your phone dies

[Barbie Hatch - Chorus]
Go to sleep so we can meet
Again
Go to sleep so we can meet
Again

[Prevail]
The first time I saw her I was breathless, speechless
A goddess in front of my eye with righteous features
Too nervous to introduce myself as "Prevail"
This has never happened before so I knew it was real
What we're buildin is a feeling that has opened me up
We build together everyday, I hope your feeling this cut
Plus we both travel the world, destination unknown
I'll meet you in a private location in Ancient Rome
In a different time zone we can finally be alone
I'm on the countdown grindin with my brothers on the road
This time around my mind is on a different mode
There's no need to shop around I got the good shit at home
I've been blessed with a priceless precious jewel
The freshest girl I met in my life is you
You're my partner in crime my lifeline understand
Close your eyes hold my hand and enter the sandman

[Chorus]

[Madchild]
If you're not dream come true, don't pretend to be
You know that I've already slept with the enemy
Lady venom has ended now that I'm independent
Livin life without tension first I'm lookin for friendship

[Prevail]
Lifestyle surrendered centered faithful focus sinful
In past life we've become closest eyes are wide open
Curse has been broken immersed in your person, truth has been spoken

[Madchild]
I'm hopin you see me when your head hit the pillow that
When I go to sleep first thing I see is your silhouette
Feel like I was always missin something true until we met
I know that we can't be together now but soon we'll meet again

[Prevail]
When tour ends, until then I'll meet you in the dream land
Cause each and every moment is important, that's the game plan
A changed man, help me put my life into perspective
It's impossible to separate as long as we're connected

[Chorus]
