[Mad Child]
Yo I'm talkin' 'bout:
Temptation, things that run through your head
Like I wonder what my friends girlfriends like in bed
Yo, I bet sometimes she thinks of me instead
Greed, that has to do with more then you need
Sin, that's usually where temptation leads
Turn it into an addiction in an instant take heat
Feedin' of your ego cash confusion and sex
That's why like every 8 months you end up back with your ex
For a couple days and then remember why it wasn't meant to be
Go your separate way and think "I wonder what got into me"
You're done but then another 8 months comes around eventually
Vicious circle, I've done some things that are worth mentioning
Temptation made me do some things I regret
Easy to fall into, but hard to forget
Used to put the blame on others, but that's a bunch of nonsense
Now I try to focus and just listen to my conscience

Yo I'm talkin' 'bout:
Temptation and it's relation to the human nation
The obvious, money drugs sexual frustration
How else can you explain public fun and grain
The exclamating murder rate, and the clime to fame
It makes men touch parts that are not to be
It makes women clutch parts that are a part of me
So all that surface level services the day to date(?)
An ongoing bases of desire and display
The first sensation recognized by script
We can't detach ourselves from it ones we get into it
And why would we it feels better with the shadows close
A comfortable feeling of comparing yours to overdose
Sometimes innocent and other times consequential
9 outta the 10 times done it's purely confidential
Harder to handle when your crew's talking in your ear
Until you learn to abstain it draws you near
Temptation
