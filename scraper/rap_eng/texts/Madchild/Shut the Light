Ooohhh
Shut the light on me
Ooohhh
Shut the light on me

[Verse 1: Prevail]
I'm trapped up in the haunted house on Diamond Road
Feel like I'm dying, but I'm not old
The summer's was a motherfucker, the winters dead cold
Diamonds and gold chains
Will bring back the old Shane
Knock, knock
Who is this?
Oh, another no name?
People always drop by
Couldn't they just walk by?
Dudes wearing tight shirts with forearms like Popeye
Four dudes in one car with one girl, come on guys
At least I had the boxing club when Mad was on those oxy drugs
Rob and I for nine hours, riding on the Greyhound bus
Survival for us is like a Swiss Army knife
Party 'round the world, I been in this group a third of my life
Yo, you heard of us right?
We're the Grindhouse trio
On the riverboat to Rio
This existence so surreal
Our brother fell down
We still around
We keep it real
But suckers be like playing themselves to have mass appeal

[Interlude]
There are things we cannot know
Invisible hands that guide the show
From up above
Sometimes you are forced to go
Far away, and shut the door
From the one you love

[Hook]
Ooohhh
Shut the light on me
Ooohhh
Shut the light on me

[Verse 2: Madchild]
My life is flowing down the drain
Knowing that I'm blowing it, and I'm going insane
I was running wild, like a horse without the reigns
Last five years still coursing through my veins
Damage to my brain, I am trapped and I am changed
Dammit if I'm playing, man I have to fly again
We're soaring
Now I'm falling
Now I'm looking for a landing field
I'm going a million miles a minute, but I'm standing still
I'm in danger
I'm an angel with a dirty face
I'm a stranger
Lone ranger in a hurting place
I had to make a choice and walk away from past
And walk a lonely path that only I can grasp
Was living in a ghost town, Disneyland on acid
Four hours away, I could hear my city laughing
All I want is hunger back and I will try my hardest
From everything to nothing, back to being a starving artist

[Interlude]
I cannot forgive myself for what it is I've done
For hating your memory like a vampire does the sun
And all I want is your love
All I want is your love

[Hook]
Ooohhh
Shut the light on me
Ooohhh
Shut the light on me
