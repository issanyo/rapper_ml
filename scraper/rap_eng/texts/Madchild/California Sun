[Intro: Madchild]
Life’s a beautiful struggle man
It’s Madchild and Russian Roulette
Not everyday is going to be perfect but the point is try to have fun with it

[Verse 1: Russian Roulette]
I guess what I’ve been told that the grass is really greener on the other side is TRUE, so I’m here to describe it all to YOU

I’m a new MAN, different blueprints to the PLAN, used to fall asleep in the BACK of a raggedy BLACK four door SEDAN, and now I’m looking at my life like god DAMN

I think we finally MADE IT, I’m going to go ham on these haters like I am the MATRIX, so give me a beat, I’m a BLAZE THAT, give me a week and a dream and I’m a do everything that I can do to make it HAPPEN, self destructive PATTERNS, I ain’t looking BACKWARDS

Battleaxe warriors and palm trees, you gotta be KIDDING ME people are finally HITTING ME up (what’s up)

I want it ALL, put me on a Hollywood STAR, from the BASEMENT I knew one day I want going to MAKE IT, chasing PAVEMENTS, this is just my STATEMENT

[Chorus (2x): Russian Roulette]
Feel the kick from the DRUM, Speaking knocking while the bass BUMP
I’m feeling A1, cocky with it and it’s only DAY 1
I’m a make it, from the Russian SLUMS to the California SUN

[Verse 2: Madchild]
(Okay) I wake up to a new day and everything is LOVLEY, Look up at the blue skies and sun it shines ABOVE ME, things are great in life, my family LOVES ME, so I ain’t tripping when people get mean and UGLY

But got a dark past the I won’t fucking FORGET, but now I’m on the right path me and Russian ROULETTE, and when it comes to ripping tracks I’m as tough as it’s GETS, I just CHUCKLE when rappers BUCKLE and get UPSET

(Yea) PALE FACE, I TRAILBLAZER and haul ass in full THROTTLE, than pop a cap like a lighter and glass Coke BOTTLE, don’t DOTTLE

Underground king I’ve been ALL DAY, your PROPANE with no FLAME, COCAINE is so LAME, hope you have insurance CLAIMS, come through like a HURRICANE, in Venice now and life is rolling smooth like POLYURETHANE

Bloody knuckles, Demons everyday I’m shadow BOXING, magic gladiator battling was CATASTROPHIC

[Chorus(2x): Russian Roulette]
2x Feel the kick from the DRUM, Speaking knocking while the bass BUMP
I’m feeling A1, cocky with it and it’s only DAY 1
I’m a make it, from the Russian SLUMS to the California SUN

[Solo]

[Chorus(2x): Russian Roulette]
2x Feel the kick from the DRUM, Speaking knocking while the bass BUMP
I’m feeling A1, cocky with it and it’s only DAY 1
I’m a make it, from the Russian SLUMS to the California SUN

[Outro: Madchild]
Aye, that’s just real shit life’s a beautiful struggle
Everyday we just keep it moving
Have fun
