Hey yo, I'm comin' with aggression, no question
I'm steadily progressing, I'm rhyming with time and money invested
I've been stressin' since I was an adolescent
Now shits so dope I can get charged with possession
Professional since cut from the umbilical
Battle me oh that'll be hysterical
Don't trip or you'll get whipped by this miracle
I'm very cool when put in a hot situation, for real
I'll send you on a permanent vacation
I'm lacing this track, I attack with anger
Lure you into my tent and scream revenga
Now watch the blood? Spit? as you die
Sparks fly, when real killers collide
I'm fearless, that's why you feel this inside
I'm clever, I never ever let shit slide
I electrify the next to try to tango with Madchild will get worked from every angle
I dismantle and handle with chaos and mayhem, and co-rock a party, until the AM

Wake up to murderous days and horrified nights
? that's why I stay true, down with the heart
Make an MC stop and chill

We'd like to take this time to give the competition thanks
So the people in my ranks get a chance to use their shanks
We'd like to take this time for the competitions aid
Cause I finally got a chance to test my new razor blades
We'd like to take this time for the competitions heights
What's useful in the usage of my coroners flood light
We'd like to take this time to give the competition praise
For nations dental records after I set the blade
As long as the competition knows that we're still here
And allows us the chance to advance the study of bacteria warfare
And thank y'all for being so up on my business
Helping me to develop crimes without a witness
And the competition knows I know they ain't comin' clean
So I perfected the work of anger release my guillotine
And finalize my thesis of the effects of stricken nicotine
On the human frame with an iron depleted blood stream
And I'd like to thank the competition for being liars
When they came to protect the sire but weren't able
Buy my ends two black gloves in the art of piano wire

That's when I come back in attacking rapidly
Once I get inside your faculty, I'm causing a catastrophe
Survivors try to retaliate only to learn they defiantly crossed the line
Past the point of no return, back and crash and burn
But you'll have to wait your turn
I take them down one at a time, do my crime and put in work
You shouldn't jerk this chain, you can't handle the downpour
Talkin' shit behind my back, what the fuck you hang around for
I'm down for my family and don't mind taking chances
I go that extra mile as Madchild quickly advances
