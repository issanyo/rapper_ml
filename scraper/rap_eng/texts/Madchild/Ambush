(Intro)
Ok, listen up! I think we're being setup for an ambush
I think there may be strong enemy forces over in these buildings over here
(Hey, I hope they're just fucking with us.)
I've requested tank support
(I ain't ready for this shit.)
Now sit back and listen to 'em, but keep your eyes open..

1,2,3,4!

Verse 1: (Moka Only)
I'm psycho-sematic, you might know the static
That automatically comes when we hit these drums
All of the underworld saying
"Here he comes, to snatch back the crown."
And that's passed around
In my fleet we beat the odds, meet the godfathers
We keep the crowd hotter.. You speakin'? Why bother?
I auto-modify my style, I got a monicker thats volitile
It's Flowtorch
No force the sport knows more resourceful, than us
Send us more rewards and parcels
I'm not the type to sit around on bar stools
Me and the mic, we been around since car pools
And now with the 90's behind me
I've finally designed the epitomy of grimy
You can find me where the sun shine be
Try me and I'll have you all cryin.. "Why me?"

(Chorus)
Ambush
Taking it back to the place we made the name known
And there's no survival
Ambush
You never seen this shit comin
And we want y'all to know we still hold the title
Ambush
We still hold the title, theres no survival
Y'all should get live
Ambush
We strike without warnin', show no remorse, we run the dark side

Verse 2: (Madchild)
Dangerous and uncivilized
Balls, brains, jaws, chains, that's how I'm livin' life
Role reversal, I go commercial
Then go back to underground with no rehearsal
Roads are closed cause boulders rolled in?
I'm a bulldozer, my shoulder's frozen!
Cold-blooded and cold-hearted, I'm cut-throat
I'm gonna' finish what I started, what's up though?
Redeem, my team raps capital regime
Captain of the making and happen machine
Boss of all bosses, you cut your losses
Catch what you're tossin', I'm fuckin' awesome!
My luck, I'll profit..
Of course I'm on my own dick, it's attached, can't get off it
Jack move, hiding under the staircase!
Army fatigues, strapped gas mask, and bear mace

Ambush
Taking it back to the place we made the name known
And there's no survival
Ambush
You never seen this shit comin
And we want y'all to know we still hold the title
Ambush
We still hold the title, theres no survival
Y'all should get live
Ambush
We strike without warnin', show no remorse, we run the dark side

Verse 3: (Prevail)
Rediscover the brotherhood of the wolves
Way we cut 'em, couldn't feed 'em to the dog
I'm involved, mystery's unsolved
The opening group's on?
Cool, tell me when its ours
I'm gonna treat it like a gymnasium
Going two-times-platinum, we only play to win
I can't hold it in, I'm spinning out of orbit
I'm comin for your fuckin' planet like I fought for it
Metamorphic, something metal in my pocket
Turn it from my mic to knife and slice an eyesocket
Got advice like Crockett and Tubbs
Got you higher than the drugs that they make in bathtubs
Ambush and push through with muscle
Push come to shove, I got you seein' double
Pure shock value, my core's c4
It's like crawlin' through a trench in the second World War

Ambush
Taking it back to the place we made the name known
And there's no survival
Ambush
You never seen this shit comin
And we want y'all to know we still hold the title
Ambush
We still hold the title, theres no survival
Y'all should get live
Ambush
We strike without warnin', show no remorse, we run the dark side

(Outro) [Madchild]:
That's what's up
I'll go double platinum and come back for my true fans, man
I had this shit planned out the whole fuckin' time
This shit is for you
Your little sisters might not get this shit
We made this for our fans, man
The people who fuckin' discovered us, supported us from the beginning
Word up

(Roger, Out!)
