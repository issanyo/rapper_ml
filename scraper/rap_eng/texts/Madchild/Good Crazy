[Verse 1: MadChild]
Madchild will massacre
Face mask with half a skull
Planet of the apes, my cape's black, it's classical
Ride the skeleton horse, cause I'm a faded painted
There's a golden ladder, but I know Satan's waiting
Feel my thunder, there's a hundred million angels singing
A billion demons chanting, they want the pain I'm bringing
So who's afraid of sinning?
Put you to the true test
Devil in a blue dress
I'll do what I do best
And I am good crazy
You can have that country
My people stand for something
I run with ravenous company
Can't imagine that a dragon has warmth under its wings
You conform to other things
You sold your soul, I got mine back
Your bowl is gold, my gaunlet's cracked
But I'm a powerful North man, my throne's made of stone
And you'll fine your house is haunted when you're home all alone

[Hook: MadChild]
I can't get used to losing
(uno mas)
I won't get used to losing
(Rule the boss)
I'm captain caveman
Cave dweller developed a bad reputation
I float your boat on[?]
Liquor cause black out
My mental central core
Mental war
Back down
I can't get used to losing
I choose seclusion
Controlled confusion

[Verse 2: MadChild]
Thoughts collected in my mind, it's a three ring circus
Kids downloading my music, hard to see my purpose
It's the path that I've chosen, I'mma keep trying working
Wings spread, breathing fire, I'm a green eyed serpent
Spit sharp thoughts, that's how it's done
While the wind brings clouds to the house of the sun
Let the rain fall while the trees dance to the sound of hate
I'm surrounded, demons pounding at the gate
My heart pump poison, skin bleed beautifully
Control the monster, nothing you can do to me
Nobody wants a problem with the man that's got nothing to lose
With bad substance abuse

[Hook]
