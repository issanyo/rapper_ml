Burn It Down 2x

[Hook]
I just can't stop tonight
Cuz its hot tonight I'm goin
Burn It Down
I know I'm feelin right
And I'm feelin like I'm goin
Burn it down
Ain't nothin goin stop this train
Cuz its off the chain
I wanna
Burn it down
Oh I wanna
Burn it down
Ey you wanna
Burn it down

[Prevail - Verse 1]
I possess more power then the Marvel universe
You understand now but you all looked startled at first
We don't play your game we make up are own rules
I'm runnin up on full strength to pick up a phone booth
Throw it right at you that and I'm tattood
Voice deeper then Ab Rude when I'm in a bad mood
This is my neighborhood a place you never could
Get over its over for you youd run if you knew what was good
For your health I ain't huntin for no one else
And theres no one else here so you can quit yellin for help
It's like the house of 1000 corpses -
For some it's hideous to me it's gorgeous

[Moka Only - Bridge]
Now spark ya things and make a flame
Tonight we goin do it like we all insane
Pyromaniacs burn this bitch
And now you goin learn whos turn this is
Light your shit up get up and move
You bring your fire I got mine to
Plus we got nothin to prove
We goin burn it down when we steppin through

[Mad Child - Verse 2]
Yo - Double fantasy of crime and punishment
I don't think you understand the amount of astonishin'
Thoughts that I'm unharnesin' an uncommon phenomenon
Shits over the top roll without reconnaissance
Vamonos you cannibals I'm the most expandable
Dangerous man on the planet you could fuck a farm animal
Don't panic its an insane maniac don't pay any attention
Of course I got problems too many to mention
Rappers comin up like "what you got there?
Another swollen members album?" (its not fair)
Please believe I'll be livin illegal
If I can't keep sellin' CD's to people
But my voice is lethal deep I breathe ether
You like I really don't wanna fuck with him me neither
I'm focused its nothin to joke about
I'm loco I'll vocally choke you out

(chorus)

[Moka Only - Verse 3]
Watch! while I knock your socks off
I'm just here to make something abnoxious pop off
And I'm kill it even if I have to talk soft
Lemme turn this up and make you crack ya drop top
I cannot stop its like a curse
You break your jaw just tryin to recite my verse
I write raps in the sun while I quench my thirst
Police helicopters gettin on my nerves
Emergency you burnin 3rd degree
So be alert while I work you can learn from me
Yea I smoke cigarettes and ???
You say my name you liable to crack your molars
I don't rub shoulders, schmooze or mingle
Pop ex and next drink booze and tingle
I just do enough so the clubs can sing to
My song tellin me that I love your single
I love you I'm single no you dont
Its just my pockets jingle I know you want
You want keys and G's and all the illy things
But slow your role ma cuz I fund a million things
This time 16 ain't enough
I got a couple more bars of the famous stuff
It's Moka O my name's like a stain in rust
It ain't about to disappear yea same with us
