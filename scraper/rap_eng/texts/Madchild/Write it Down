[Intro] Organik
(Make some motherfucking noise for Madchild)


[Hook]

You might not like the shit I do
I might not like the shit you do
I'm just glad that I'm not like you
And they’re just glad that I'm not quite through...

Don't even think about it, write it down
Don't even think about it, write it down
Don't even think about it, write it down
Don't even think about it, write it down


[Verse 1]
I'm dangerous like an angel with black wings and some gold horns
Lyrically the hulk, waking up with my clothes torn
Lyrically you suck like waking up with a coldsore
You got the other night from making out with a coke whore
Don't bother trying to make sense, your shit I'm imagining
I'm just bragging with above average savagery
Dark arts and imagery, drawn from my tragedy
Shane's brain's a dragon 'cause of Shane's pain and agony
Yeah, I'm breathing fire from a distance
Look at my persistence, firing on all pistons
You don't want fuck with me, I'm sickest with this pen, boy
Meticulously ill just to ridiculously enjoy
Young Mike Tyson in his prime
Schwarzenegger in Conan
A nomad, De Niro in Ronin
Terrifying immigrant, tearing limbs from ligaments
Smoking cigarettes, I still rap like I'm young and ignorant


[Hook]
You might not like the shit I do
I might not like the shit you do
I'm just glad that I'm not like you
And they’re just glad that I'm not quite through...

Don't even think about it, write it down
Don't even think about it, write it down
Don't even think about it, write it down
Don't even think about it, write it down


[Verse 2]
These rappers suck
Other listeners as pissed as I am
Mystifying, twisted little giant with the fist of iron
Old school, never call me that, forever futuristic
I get it cracking, watch this cracker flip and go ballistic
I'm not ashamed to be the tyrant that I am
'Cause I can get as violent as The Silence of the Lambs
Mind is riotous, pirate of the land, quit your sniveling
You can't find a near equivalent deliverance
Making music for all my siblings
Trimming off the simplest, talking like I'm belligerent
Taking chances, fucking groupie bitches bareback
Silverback gorilla, I'm snapping like I'm a bear trap


[Sample]


[Verse 3]
Can't believe I'm fell for it again like I'm the laughingstock
Problem is a pussy perfect sweeter than an apricot
Now I'm feeling trapped, chains wrapped around my ankle socks
Connected to a concrete block with bolts and shackles locked
(Fuck!)
Before I drown like I'm a sack of rocks
Back to ripping songs with killer hooks like I'm a tackle box
I'm an angry ox
Underground with all the fucking Fraggle Rocks
Hope you get the picture like a Magnavox


[Hook]
You might not like the shit I do
I might not like the shit you do
I'm just glad that I'm not like you
And they’re just glad that I'm not quite through...

Don't even think about it, write it down
Don't even think about it, write it down
Don't even think about it, write it down
Don't even think about it, write it down
