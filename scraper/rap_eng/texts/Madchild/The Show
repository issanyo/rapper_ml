Hi Baby!

[Verse 1]

I get down like Slaine in the town, spread pain all around
Hollow tips like rain on the ground
I do enough pills to kill an elephant
So many drugs I was seeing pink elephants
Now everybody catching felony charges
I was caught up in the mix, spill irrelevant garbage
You could probably tell the involvement
A hell of a problem. Now my head is revolvin'
Now I wish I was high baby
Cause I'm barley gettin' by baby
But I gotta say thanks to my baby
That's cause she know that in my head I ain't been right lately
Plus, it's hard for me to study the art when
Six kids left in a bloody apartment
Semi-Automatic Handguns in hidden compartments
Sunshine suddenly darkness
Got a beard on my face like Captain Caveman
Raps so fat they can crack the pavement
Supreme ball jacket wearin' black ray bans
Wheels cost a fortune, Pat Sajak
Used to pop my collar like the Fonzie
Then I got high
Walk around like a zombie
Walking out calmly
Throwin' up gangster signs
Swinging side to side like Frankenstein
Throwin' up the W, In my BMW
Alife's warface bubblegoose
On tour gettin' head till my cock hurts
Sit back, smoke cigarettes in my boxers
Listen to my CD. I know you see me
I'm like 3D popping out your TV
Name Madchild but as young as Jeezy
Ya i'm gettin' old but these girls are easy
Used to be the side show now i'm on the main stage
Keep gettin' older these girls stay the same age

[Outro]
