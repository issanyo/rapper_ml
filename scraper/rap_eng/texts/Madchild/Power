[Hook]:

Power's powerful
You want it, you can have it, huh?
If not, gonna chase it, too many people have it, huh?
You want it, you need it, you breathe it, you can eat it, huh?
You feel it, you read it, you bleed it, you believe IT'S ALL POWER

Power's powerful
You want it, you can have it, huh?
If not, gonna chase it, too many people have it, huh?
You want it, you need it, you breathe it, you can eat it, huh?
You feel it, you read it, you bleed it, you believe IT'S ALL POWER

[Verse 1] Prevail:

I'm never grounded out, connected to too many power sources
Electric forces flow through cerebellum, element M
Magnesium trapped or pulled through narrow spaces
Narrow spaces like 12, through it all, it's all
Blew on the moon's far side, take a bizarre ride
Car crash, joy ride, go through Vancouver from the lamp light to port side
Count all those door steps and yell out my name loud
Prevail and fail is not an option
Yo, another nail in the coffin, I'm dropping you
I've been here popping since J was in the record crew
The blue record, take with a stick, kill your landlord, the coupe
They feeling me more than you, believing it's more than y'all
I'm making more music, music proves, Montreal
You can lose it all fucking with the three striped Adidas kings
My street hype is real life, I feel like I don't need a thing
But power!

[Verse 2] Madchild:

Call me He-Man, master of the universe
Master of disaster, little bastard never ruin a verse
Unabomber, I be bombing on a common enemy
Sonically superior, bionic with the chemistry
A common denominator, you call me the terminator
Battling my demons, saddle on your dreaming
Built in generator, innovative general
I ain't afraid of anyone but they're afraid of many more
Cause I got the power, we got the power
Tongue is like a loaded clip, I fire shots at cowards
Might shock for hours, might rock the towers
Height rock from night hawk to spray toxic showers
My life's like 20 seasons of Sopranos
Mixed with Sons of Anarchy, you can't change the channel
But I change the channel, I change my bed sheets to flannel
Leaving all them deadbeats and scoundrels
A coupe's classic like a damn grand piano
Walk it up like a vandal, just check every angle
