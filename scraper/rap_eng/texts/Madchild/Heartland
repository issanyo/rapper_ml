[Verse 1] Prevail
Yo
I pound my chest like a silverback, but this ain’t the Jungle Book
Hitchhike a trilogy, Copperhead Road
Diamonds in the caravan, pirates in the cove
Pilots in the fighter jet, nosedive and barrel roll
Real rock n roll type attitude I got
Bite chain in my hand, that’s the chain of command
The rightness of doom holes, the instrument of tragedy
Mercury septic depicted on a tapestry
Chapter 57, Verse 23
Book of Prevail
Legendary hunter of the sea (I am)
Guided by the North Star, no arrows for the albatross
Inhale asbestos the fragments tear your lungs apart
It’s deliverance, consider this an omen
A token of faith until the next dimension opens
Outer space, zero gravity, below freezing
You’re a thousand light years from home you’ve stopped breathing

[Hook]

[Madchild]
Rocking in the Midwest. We going down south
I’m a wild motherfucker, I’m a loud mouth
Take the [?], rowdy as a roadhouse
I’m a loud motherfucker, I’ma wild out

[Prevail]
In the Midwest, we going down south
I’m a loud motherfucker, I’ma wild out
Take the [?], rowdy as a roadhouse
Living in a ghost town, bringing it to your house

[Verse 2] Madchild
I had to battle for my soul
Won it back from the Devil when I beat him at the crossroads
I’m on a mountain and I live in a cave
Got a couple secrets I’ma take to the grave
I’m meaner than a rattlesnake, strong as a bull
I’m a branded bandit with two axes and a skull
Who the fuck you think you’re talking to?
Madchild, this is a bear trap you walked in to

[Verse 3] Prevail
Sharper than the eyes of a hawk
Jailhouse Rock
Prevail One, nail gun talk
I’ll tear you apart like a butcher from the gangs of New York with bricks, swatch knives and pitchforks
Territorial, imperial, I feel like Attila
Material profiles of a serial killer
Awaken the gatekeeper, the ice man cometh
The master of puppets, disasters among us

[Hook]

[Madchild]
Rocking in the Midwest. We going down south
I’m a wild motherfucker, I’m a loud mouth
Take the [?], rowdy as a roadhouse
I’m a loud motherfucker, I’ma wild out

In the Midwest. We going down south
I’m a wild motherfucker, I’m a loud mouth
Take the [?], rowdy as a roadhouse
Living in a ghost town, bringing it to your house

[Verse 4] Prevail
Caught in the crossfire, pierced by the ricochet
Prev One Navy SEAL, Madchild Green Beret
Helicopter, Apache, missile launch, tomahawk
Crown of spike blown apart, burn up like Joan of Arc
Don’t provoke us, chokehold diagnosis
So close to losing your focus to psychosis
I’m agile, you’re fragile, break and shatter
To make matters worse, you’re climbing up Jacob’s Ladder

[Verse 5] Madchild
How does Mad manage to cause damage and then vanish
And singlehandedly manhandle the whole planet
I can’t man, I got two crew companions
Like Yosemite Sam standing with two cannons
Man I can flow
You panic like I’m a gigantic mechanical bull
I’m out of control
I like my Heineken’s cold
Platinum plaque raps, I ain’t trying to go gold

[Hook]

[Prevail]
Rocking in the Midwest. We going down south
I’m a wild motherfucker, I’m a loud mouth
Take the [?], rowdy as a roadhouse
I’m a loud motherfucker, I’ma wild out

[Madchild]
In the Midwest. We going down south
I’m a wild motherfucker, I’m a loud mouth
Take the [?], rowdy as a roadhouse
Living in a ghost town, bringing it to your house
