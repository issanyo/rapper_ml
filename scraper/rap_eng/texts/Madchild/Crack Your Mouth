[Hook]
It goes back and forth
Fuck around and I’ma crack your mouth (crack your mouth)
It goes forth and back
Prev One, Prev One
I’m ahead of the pack

It goes back and forth
Fuck around and I’ma crack your mouth (crack your mouth)
It goes forth and back
Madchild, Madchild
Take a crack at the track
Madchild, Madchild
Take a crack at the track
Madchild, Madchild
Take a crack at the track
Madchild, Madchild
Take a crack at the track

… Take a crack at the track

[Verse 1] Madchild
Watch out when I growl
I need a towel
When it come to cash drool drips from my jowl
(I’m foul, foul)
If you owe me, pal
Pal, I want my money and I want it right now
You’re like wow, holy cow, he hold it down
The golden child, he hold ‘til he’s rollin’ out
Stand out, (out), I’ma show you how to
I’m proud to do things I’m not allowed to
Always have been. You a has-been
I’m what’s happening when it come to rapping
From my flaps to the strap to my cap I’m the captain
Baseball bat to the dome, holmes, crack it
Wrap it, stamp it, stomp it then repack it
Nice price drop, that’s a stepped on package
I’m from the city where gangsters eat sushi
Rocking that, rocking that Louis and Gucci
No risk, no reward
I take pills because I’m bored
Still pray to the lord
With the axe and the sword

[Hook]
It goes back and forth
Fuck around and I’ma crack your mouth (crack your mouth)
It goes forth and back
Madchild, Madchild
I’m ahead of the pack (yes you are)

It goes back and forth
Fuck around and I’ma crack your mouth (crack your mouth)
It goes forth and back
Prev One, Prev One
Take a crack at the track
Prev One, Prev One
Take a crack at the track
Prev One, Prev One
Take a crack at the track
Prev One, Prev One
Take a crack at the track

Back to back raps that’ll crack your back

[Verse 2] Prevail
You’ve been sleepin’, sleepin’ asking where the day has gone
I stay way strong, I’d stay away if I were you
You likely to get preyed on
Shorts with my name on ‘em
Classic, not ironed on with neon. Captive
Slave to our music. The action unit
Before you hear it, we have to fine-tune it
Do it, move it when I say
Prove it, move it when I stray
Spit out lyrics now that bounce off your vertebrae
(One) stay out of our way
(Two) might play out another way
(Three) had you just obeyed
(Four) would’ve seen another day
(One) stay out of our way
(Two) might play out another way
(Three) had you just obeyed
(Four) would’ve seen another day
(One)

[Hook]
It goes back and forth
Fuck around and I’ma crack your mouth (crack your mouth)
It goes forth and back
Madchild, Madchild
I’m ahead of the pack (yes you are)

It goes back and forth
Fuck around and I’ma crack your mouth (crack your mouth)
It goes forth and back
Prev One, Prev One
Take a crack at the track
Take a crack at the track
Take a crack at the track
Take a crack at the track
I’m ahead of the pack
