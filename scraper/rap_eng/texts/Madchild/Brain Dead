[Verse 1]
I smash bars like it's crash up derby
Fuck groupie sluts, dawg my ass so dirty
Act 21 bitch, but I'm over 30
I love doin' drugs, I don't go to bed early
I quit doin' drugs, I can feel my brain meltin'
Talking myself, but these talks ain't helpin'
Watching a racial porn, I do not feel filthy
Fuck anything that walks with 3 holes, I'm so guilty
Lookin' in the mirror like "Help me"
My reflection walked away, that bitch's selfish
Relentless, bent on the helpless
I'm heartless, not true, but I'm filled up with darkness
Ripped up and stomped on, avoid me like swamp rats
No contact, I ain't fucking short bitch I'm compact
How could I be so popular and lonely?
Don't even need to fuck, just someone that'll hold me
Girl to hold my head and tell that I'm not a monster
Now you know the answer, why I fuck at every concert

[Hook]
I just wanna punch out
I just wanna lunge out
Grab somebody by the throat
Cut their fucking tongues out
Put a potato on the barrel for the mufflin'
Put it to my temple, I seduce you with my sufferin'
I just wanna punch out
I just wanna lunge out
Grab somebody by the throat
Cut their fucking tongue out

[Verse 2]
Rape me like a female ape with forced entry
Grab my cock and tell me you love me but do it gently
Put some cocaine on the table, yes please, tempt me
Instead I drive at night all alone, I'm so empty
I must be the most miserable alive
Avoiding conversations till I wither up and die
You see the snakes slither through the flies
See the maggots in the skull start crawlin' out the eyes
Euphoric gorror to a dull and blackened background
Swingin' with the Louisville Slugger, I won't back down
Brain dead, my aim's bad, focus blurred and foggy
Realize it's age, hit the sauna and start jogging
Suicide king, call my next of kin
But I feel excellent as long as I'm on Dexedrine
The beast tastings, available on East Hastings
Feel spacey, memories are racing

[Hook]
I just wanna punch out
I just wanna lunge out
Grab somebody by the throat
Cut their fucking tongue out
Put a potato on the barrel for the mufflin'
Put it to my temple, I seduce you with my sufferin'
I just wanna punch out
I just wanna lunge out
Grab somebody by the throat
Cut their fucking tongues out
Put a potato on the barrel for the mufflin'
Put it to my temple, I seduce you with my sufferin'
