[Verse 1]
Yeah
I am back with a vengeance
I'm a cowboy that hangs with the Indians
Yeah I'm dancing with wolves
But I ain't hiding nothing, I don't wear sheeps clothes
Look into my mind it's a freak show
If you don't like what I do you can deep-throat
All eight inches
Fuck you, fuck hate and fuck fake friendships
Yeah
I am violent frequent
One thing I'll never get is the silent treatment
Work everyday, that's my fucking secret
I'm the underground king so I'm not beneath it
All you fuckboys that shit-talk
Punch a hole through your face like it's gyprock
Take a hit bitch, dip. You could kick rocks
I'm dope like a brick rock of yay' in a Ziploc
I'm a Wu-tang Clan freak
Plus I'm colorful like Toucan Sam's beak
300 pound gorilla that snorts cocaine
Put a lighter to my mouth, spit propane
Everyday I'm losing hair, I need Rogaine
Before I get my teeth fixed, probably get a gold chain
Flow so cold man
I am here forever, I'm classic like John Coltrane

[Hook]
Yeah
Put your cash away
Put a rapper in the ring, I will smash his face
Knock him out cold to a basket case
I am young Mike Tyson, I'm Cassius Clay

Yeah
One of the greatest of all time
I am young Mike Tyson in his damn prime
Half these cats that are big now, they can't rhyme
So I'll keep fighting 'till the bell, reading champs minds

[Verse 2]
You will find no resemblance
Tats on my face wearing Pendleton
(Baxwar)
Got a skull that's an emblem
Stylin', the look in my eyes got them trembling
MCs sitting on the rafts, bunch of simpletons
Smash like I'm serving on a brass out in Wimbledon
Get stomped while a crowd starts assembling
I'm wearing Red Wing boots, never Timberland's
Still, that'll leave such a mess
Like my life last year, now it's the fucking best
Please, don't put me to the fucking test
Slice your heart while it's beating right from out your chest
Yeah
I'm on a rise like I'm stepping on an elevator
Writing songs for the kids, you can tell they're faded
A lot of dudes get old, fat and hella jaded
But I'm a bionic man, brain's accelerated

[Hook]
Yeah
Put your cash away
Put a rapper in the ring, I will smash his face
Knock him out cold to a basket case
I am young Mike Tyson, I'm Cassius Clay

Yeah
One of the greatest of all time
I am young Mike Tyson in his damn prime
Half these cats that are big now, they can't rhyme
So I'll just fight 'till the bell, reading champs minds

[Verse 3]
No choice but to get productive
If I don't create I get self destructive
Slap a rapper like a puck
That's Canucks, no fuck stick
Don't criticize if it's not constructive
Not the one to fuck with
Say another one, you should try your luck with
When it comes to killing shit I am bursting out the seams
All these other rappers really all as thirsty as it seems?
I am hungry, please believe there's a difference
Not acting like a bunch of crack fiends on a mission
Madchild, I am mean, I am vicious
I'm so clean that I glisten
Yeah
So all these rappers better get a grip
I've give the people what they want to hear instead of shit
I leave scars, start cracking like a leather whip
I got bars, start snapping when I let 'em rip

[Hook]
Yo
Put your cash away
Put a rapper in the ring, I will smash his face
Knock him out cold to a basket case
I am young Mike Tyson, I'm Cassius Clay

Yeah
One of the greatest of all time
I am young Mike Tyson in his damn prime
Half these cats that are big now, they can't rhyme
So I'll just fight 'till the bell, reading champs minds

(That's whats up.)
