[Intro] Madchild
Let me make one thing clear
I love hip hop
I live and breathe this shit
And I love relevant hip hop today, I love whats poppin'
Except for these kids that rap like they're in grade three
Like this cocky little rapper like a fucking stupid
That shits gotta stop
Yo

[Verse 1] Madchild

To beat Madchild, that is next to impossible
I'll beat you like a dirty ass correctional officer
Kids have gone from fresh to death to being a bunch of fags
Line em' up and all start going ape like fucking punching bags
Man dresses?
That is not the way a man dresses
Have to watch it now
I might mistake you for some damn bitches
They all yelling turn it up. Drinking death from a cup
But I am still the flyest motherfucker, Death from above
I get the baddest bitches plus I got the dopest clothes
Western watches. Rappers all today a bunch of hopeless hoes
Can't believe I used to make fun of these hipsters
These rappers out today now look like their little sisters
'Bout to cop a new Ferrari. Park it by my G-Wagon Benz
Can't wait until this trend ends for you and all your faggy friends
Me rap like that? You can jump in a hell hole
Rappers acting like their twelve doin' that shit with their elbows

[Hook] Madchild
Open up my mouth and I am emptying a full clip
My fans don't want to hear that stupid fucking bullshit
(Fuckboys) gettin' tired of all these fairies now
You can turn it up, I'm still gonna tear it down

Starting to get embarrassed now
Every song sounds the same
A bunch of parrots now
One of the underground kings, that's why I wear a crown
My fans don't wanna hear that shit, so imma tear it down

[Verse 2] Intrinzik
Ayo
I don't even know what the fuck is on the radio
They only play you if you dress like a lady though
These rappers don't deserve to piss up in the men's room
See them on instagram kissing all there friends too
I'd fucking take your face and shove it in the toilet
The only problem is you love it and enjoy it
Hey look it's you dude, you are in the urinal
In San Francisco at the TransBay terminal
Hip hop really needs it's fucking basics back
It went from gangsta rap to breaking gays that rap
The days that being hard meant you took a shot
Replaced with taking hard cock to get on top
Ha-I don't know, I guess i'm staying underground
It's like the only place there ain't much gay lovin' now
I don't have to move Jenners for the fame G
Too many Bruce Jenners make it in the mainstream

[Hook] Madchild
Open up my mouth and I am emptying a whole clip
My fans don't want to hear that stupid fucking bullshit
(Fuckboys) gettin' tired of all these fairies now
You can turn it up, I'm still gonna tear it down

Starting to get embarrassed now
Every song sounds the same
A bunch of parrots now
One of the underground kings, that's why I wear a crown
My fans don't wanna hear that shit, i'm bout to tear it down
