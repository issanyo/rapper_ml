[Intro]
But meanwhile over in one of the uh, less attractive alleys
A top level meeting has been called by a kookie cat
Called “Top Cat”

[Verse 1]
Okay
Pistol packing poison Bandolero, an abandoned hero
Landed on this planet, I am stranded in the land of zeros
Bow down bitch, modern day feral
Kick Cupid in the balls and then I stole his fucking arrows
Tomorrow, tomorrow. Write my name like Zorro
Tag my name on walls and I am broke enough to borrow
Soon I’ll be an underground rapper with a Bentley
And all my competition I will break it to them gently
Tell Watson that it’s elementary
‘Cause I feel like I’ve been doing this for fucking centuries
Back into the States, I truly hope that I am granted entry
Heaven’s gates, I really hope that I am granted entry
Yo, they call me king of Canada, that’s my anointment
And when I’m meeting people now they are divine appointments
They shower me with gifts, candles and the finest ointments
And incense, I’m intense. My girl’s a princess
Never fuck with family, dawg, that shit is incest
Stopping competition like a motherfucking insect
Look out for Madchild, he’s a monster, really wants to bite us
Rap until I lose my fucking voice and I got tonsillitis
Middle aged little ankle biter taking tranquilizers
Everything I say is tantalizing, I’m an improviser
I’m on the rise now. You could read the articles
I’ll blow a rappers brain to particles, I have a heart of gold

[Scratch Hook]
Break it down like this (x2)

[Verse 2]
Okay, look
Ayo, I'm still trying to make it, other things I had to sacrifice
They love my hunger rapping with the massive appetite
Running circles around your head
Saran wrap, you can't breathe
Lock the door like Sunny in the bar, now you can't leave
Turn a rapper into mash potatoes. I'm a mass tornado
I'll turn a children's mind to mush just like a batch of Play-Doh
Banned from America. Something you can't duplicate
So I'm a lonely alien like from the movie Super 8
Yeah, my rhymes are hard like algebra
Don't scrap words, I recycle them and salvage them
I said these rappers they are semi frauds
I am an immortal, I'm a beast, I am a Demigod
Banned from America, my angel is the centerfold
Brain is full of poisonous fumes and dangerous chemicals
Can't even associate with them 'cause they are morons
Think that they are dope, I got more talent in my forearm
I'm banging on these motherfuckers like I'm Travis Barker
I'll erase their fucking names like i'm a magic marker
I'm still alive, it's a miracle like Magic Johnson
Old as fuck, but still a new flavor like Action Bronson
I'll keep rapping 'till I thrash my tonsils
A fucking dragon breathing fire, I've got ashy nostrils
Motherfucker, I'm the last Apostle
Rap dinosaur I'll probably be the last Jurassic fossil

[Scratch Hook]
