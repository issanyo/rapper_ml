These rappers talk like felons but they’re all fake villains
Madchild about to erupt like Mount St. Helens
I don’t give a fuck if I hurt your feelings
Get your helmet cracked, I’m a silverback gorilla
Yeah, this is quantum physics
Little monster will stomp on you daunted midgets
I’ve lived a life full of wrong decisions
I got condoms for conjugal visits

Blond haired midgets, monsters, mongrels and wizards
This is on-going, I’m throwing bombs in a blizzard
This is calculated long division
I got a strong condition, my funds are insufficient
It was a really fucking long intermission
Now I’m going all out and I ain’t asking for permission
While I gather up my arsenal you couldn’t wrap a parcel
You’re a harsh-farce marshmallow with a arsehole

I don’t wear bar clothes, I’m not getting a barcode
Tatted on my arm bro, you couldn’t hit a barn door
My aim’s perfect, it ain’t worth it
Perfectly wired circuitry, hurt you like I’m Hercules
Then paint my face cause inside I’m a dark circus freak
Lurking through the forest with a black axe handle
Wax candles, dropping acid, drinking Jack Daniels
A masked vandal, I’m a victim of a bad scandal

The Mad’s Rambo, commando in a black Lambo
Used to gamble back when my head was scrambled
Now I’m Foghorn Leghorn eating a ham bone
Playing in a jamboree with a tambourine eating a tangerine
A backpack with a change of clothes and couple cans of beans
Wait, I sounded like Yelawolf there, I wonder if he’d care
He seems like a pretty good guy, he probably won’t mind
So back to being Madchild, opposite of fragile
People think I ought to rad style, fuckk Madchild
