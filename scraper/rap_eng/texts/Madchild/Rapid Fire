[Verse 1] Hiway
When I begin fixin' this picture
It's slim pickins for vindictive fish their fins flippin'
I'm sinister sin-stricken. When I spit intricate limericks
Their skin thickens, The spins kick in, My win sickens em'
They're tearing up at their chin's twitching
Looking as if they been slippin'
Sticking their dick in a "Shim" trickin', straight binge hittin
While the Pimp listens
My grim writtens are similar to grippin' a biscuit
Clickin', Pickin' em' off like a 7/10 split with the tenth pin tippin
I'll dead the president while reciting the pledge of allegiance
My shit is clean, Ironed with fresh creases
Why try to connect with Jesus
After all i'm already using a major city skyline as my chess pieces
Weezle reppin' TGS, Nothing pretty, I must officially
Introduce myself to know your trust is with me
Rock the boat and you'll be falling out like Yung Buck & 50
I keep the world in my friend zone. No ones fucking with me
Eh-Heh!

[Hook] Madchild
I've been into hip-hop since Rock-the-Bells
Serve more rappers than Taco Bell
Madchild fresh like Aqua Vel
If you are not Baxwar, you will not prevail
These raps bottom of the bargain barrel
So I smash these smurfs like i'm Gargamel
I've been into hip-hop since Rock-the-Bells
And I serve more rappers than Taco Bell

[Verse 2] Hiway
I'm very poised
I can make a dedicated emcee believe that rap isn't his Primary choice
I speak in binary code so they cannot
Vicariously share my shine
I'll leave em' all rhymin' in their library voice....
No emotion like RoboCop when I load and cock
The frontal lobe and I throw my thoughts at em'
Joking or Not
Photoshopping a ghost in your photo 'op
When I go to crop, no CÃ®roc but i'll soak a hoe in soda pop
I'm sure there's a whole lotta shit you wanna show Barack
But your vote not important
They'll probably tell to go blow a cock
That "Yolo" talk is a total crock of shit!
This is the road to walk
Over-chop all you want. it's not gonna land you a promo spot
Fuck their little swagger and their rap attire
Claiming they from "The Block" but they look like
Joey Mcintyre
Shit, half of the rap game is comprised of rats and liars
That's why I'm having a blast when i'm hittin' em' with the
Rapid fire

Eh, been into hip-hop since Rock-the-Bells
And I serve more rappers than Taco Bell

[Verse 3] Madchild
About to grow a beard and walk around in Birkinstocks
Walk into a club a guarantee that's when the twerkin' stops
Had to re-wire my brain and change the circuit box
Had to spit fire and flames to make the hurtin' stop
Pull up a dope beat, I already laced it
Progressing so fast, shit I'm part of the Matrix
Dreams gettin' old, getting harder to chase it
But I'm getting so close I can already taste it
Why do, why do, what I do. I do, I do it my way
Because I'm doin' 80 in my Mercedes on the Highway
Rolex next then a Bentley in my driveway
And still a nightmare like it's the 13th on Friday
Underground King I do it my way like Frank Sinatra
And walk and rap like I am cranky with the swanky posture
I fill my bank cause I'm a Super Beast and Angry Monster
Not trying to dance in fancy costumes at a faggy concert
