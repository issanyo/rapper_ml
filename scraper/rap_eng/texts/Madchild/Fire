[Verse 1: Mad Child]
I'm staring in a mirror but mostly I laugh
I’m looking at the picture of a sociopath
Hope to get first now hopefully last
Dope rap, I’m known for doing dope in the past
Like floating down the river on an opium boat
But I’m a wild animal, I go for the throat
I’m a big bad wolf with a big black Glock
And some real dark thoughts, yelling: “Open the door!”
I punch people in the face coming down the staircase
Wander down the hall with the can of bear mace
Hey, I’ve been a killer since the Wu-Tang Clan
Personality is colourful like Toucan Sam
I’m a crazy cat, Sylvester, damn
I got two big guns; Yosemite Sam
I used to work birds like Tweety
Speedy Gonzales living in a palace
Tripped and fell down the rabbit hole and met Alice
Five years later, now I’m back for the challenge
Still rip up shows like Tasmanian Devil
If some punk jump up I’m blasting my heavy metal
And I still live in Van, but I’m moving soon
All my homies on the streets fucking Looney Tunes
But I’ll be back, back and forth with no error
Enforcing terror in a Porsche Carrera
Through Vancouver to Los Angeles, archangels
Dark strangers, blacks and caucasians
(Man we crack skulls, make deep lacerations
Crack a Red Bull and drag him back to my basement)

[Hook: Mad Child]
We fly through the air like Iron Man
Crack you in the head with a frying pan
Can't fuck with my team. We are ironclad
I’m on fire, man, call the fireman

Whether crawling up the wall like Spider-Man
Or lyin' on the floor popping vitamins
Yeah, real hip-hop, we supplying fans
We on fire, man, call the fireman

[Verse 2: Prevail]
All right, I keep my knife in the black leather sheath
Real sharp blade Dagger Mouth Armed to the Teeth
I can’t draw, but I’m raw when I’m drawn to the beat
It’s like Saw part 1, I’ll make you saw off your feet
What the fuck is defeat? I’m undefeated like a shoe store
Runway, one way street take a detour
Robot, CP3O, R2D2
Plastic bag over your face hard to breathe through
Preview a track and download the album
X marks the spot like my first name was Malcolm
Make you sing the blues like a Prison In Folsom
Spit a burning Ring of Fire, watch the flames engulf 'em
My theory very logical, but we use Pro Tools
Fuck with us you’ll be a dead man, a corpse in the soundbooth
And ain’t nobody hear you, close the door make it soundproof
My pattern very classical like Herringbone and Houndstooth
ICP, REP, bright, evil clown suit
Ice-cold water in a bottle when I drown dudes
Beat side homicide unit try to find you
Burning sound, turn around, my dude’s right behind you

[Hook]
