[Intro]
When the shit goes down you better be ready
(When the shit goes down)

[Verse 1] [Mad Child]:
I turn He-Man to She-Ra, Battlecat to Cringer
West Coast Avenger, Mad Child’s a ninja
Fist of the North Star, I’m going hard
Lions flying out my mouth like a throwing star
Tough luck, nun chucks for these dumb fucks
Young dukes jump up, they get fucked up
I can levitate (why?) I’m a featherweight (nah)
I’m a heavyweight, hope to get to Heaven’s gate
But not yet (watch it) I’m a freakin savage
Running all around and I am busy wreaking havoc
Funny when I rap it sounds like I’m committing murder
But have to ask the question, “How come I ain’t getting further?”
I’m a fucking lunatic, I can be a moody bitch
Great white shark eating rappers like you’re tuna fish
Kill em I annihilate, villain with an iron blade
Fuck when I rock I am hot watch a fire blaze
Welcome to the freak fest, Mad Child’s a monster
First do a concert then do an encore
Mad got the game on lock like a door handle
War angel, black cape with an orange candle now I’ve gone commando
Running through the streets with the gun of Rambo
Knife on my belt that could cut your scalp
Quit drugs now I’m back you can fuck yourself

[Verse 2] [Mad Child]:
Tattooed up top to bottom sleeves
Never fall again like autumn leaves
Dark like the Legend of Sleepy Hollow
I’m the big bad wolf, you are sheep that follow
Crawl into bed, take a power nap
Eat your kids in a nightie and a shower cap
All these little piggies run when the shit goes down
Cause I’m here to blow your motherfucking brick house down
Nasty North American, that’s because I’m arrogant
Kids think you’re fucked, yeah I know, I’m aware of it
Morphine and opiates warping this derelict
Hopefully appropriate scorpions terrorist
I need a therapist, someone to talk to
You dumb? There is something that’s wrong, what the fuck dude?
Started off in clubs going back to auditoriums
Leader of an army, Battle Axe Warriors

[Verse 3] [Prevail]:
Breaker breaker one nine
I’ll break a back and snap a spine if you ever think of taking mine
Sunshine, moonshine, sun rays or moonbeams
Balance the black magic monsters and bad dreams
Animated sandman, death is on your doorstep
Take a deep breath, you are not ready for war yet
I’m a rap war vet, all black Corvette
I’m all for torture, don’t forget we never forfeit
I’m talking full clip, a decade of hits
And then ten years of turmoil tears you to bits
We never miss when the missile’s locked on to the target
Send you back to evolution, you can meet Charles Darwin
I’m the king of everything, I’m a universal sovereign
Universal studios, you’re still using Garage Band
Abusing all musicians who’s confused this is our land
Rob Viking, Mad Child, Prevail, that’s the game plan
