Oh and you know it yea
And you know it yea
And you know it yea
And you know it yea

[Hook]
Im so fly (so fly) so fly (so fly)
Dropped 300 G's on my ride
Ya I'm fly, so fly
Bullet proof whip full of women inside
Swollen Members are flyest
Swollen Members are flyest
Swollen Members are flyest
Swollen Members are flyest

[Verse 1: Mad Child]
You can try shooting but you ain't hitting shit
I just dropped 300 on a bullet proof whip
You copped a 300? I dropped like 300
On a bullet proof whip so you ain't saying shit
Yeah my Gucci bunny she bought me a Gucci money clip
But my money so thick that my money don't fit
I got so many clothes I don't know which to pick
If it ain't Gucci or Louis then it ain't about shit
I'm so fly I'm VIP I never
Wait in line. I design rhymes in clever ways
A heavy featherweight. So fly, I levitate
So fly, I elevate. So high I'm heavenly

[Chorus]
Hop on my G ride, them Gucci jeans fit, cause I'm a G making G's with my G chicks
Shorty I'll take you around the world in my G6 you got a man lets just keep this a secret

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Prevail]
Now shorty wanna lay back in the Maybach
When I start she don't say stop even when them haters pop
Bullet proof glass I'm the captain first class
The leather soft as a feather. Under the seat my Beretta
The motherfucker try to jack me to heaven
They headed now, hollow tips bouncing off my hood
My whip like superman
Ill thank you for shooting me
I'm not even the Luger king
Penetrate. You don't believe it? Well, let me demonstrate
My jewelery custom made. Runs in my blood line
Cuts like a razor blade. Stay away from one time
Except for that one time. That was only over night
They fucked up the paper work. Now thats what I call oversight, ye

[Chorus]

[Hook]
