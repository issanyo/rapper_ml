[Intro]
Let me see your identification
We don't need see his identification
These aren’t the droids we’re looking for
He can go about his business
Move along, move along
Someone was in the pod
The tracks move off in this direction
This suit is hot...

[Verse 1: Prevail]
I woke up in outer space, experienced a free fall
This shit is not a free-for-all, I'm living total recall
Me and all my friends are taking over past memories
Overloading sensories, inventively prone
It's like Attack of the Clones with all these robots and drones
I hear the gears turnin' and churnin', they burnin' out my headphones
Determined not to let go, confirming there's an echo
Below, in, and above and I'm returning to the threshold
Never let your flesh go cold, it means you're old and dying
Staring out at supernovas, feels like an ocean line
Or watch as zero gravity deprives you of your body weigh
Loosing all your oxygen, makes it hard to concentrate
I'm the great explorer, float around in a shuttle
Touched down on solid ground so people call me P double
I see the rubble through the Hubble with the lenses like Zeiss
Planet Earth to Major Tom, so have the time of your life

[Scratch Hook]
When the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
I'll travel to the end of the universe and beyond
No sense of place, lost in outer space
I'm a man, that's on the mission
When the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
I'll travel to the end of the universe and beyond
No sense of place, lost in outer space
I'm a man's man, that's on the mission


[Verse 2: Madchild]
The world in 2050, many men are shifty
Floating up in outer space, many men are with me
Landed on the planet Earth, was an angry man at birth
Was an angry man at first, stranded now I'm banded smurf
I'm a nice guy but I'm not gonna finish last
Startin' to look like Popeye, eat my fuckin' spinach fast
Blast a droid, blast an asteroid, still a master, boy
Hear me laughin' while I'm crafting up a crafty ploy
Standing out like I'm an orange storm trooper
Fuck a rapper like it's foreign porn, stupid
I'm the little monster, I was born super
Had to kill my old self but I was torn, Looper
Uber awesome, blossom above the hemisphere
Group of possums, not to many men I fear
My mind is totally thrashed, my heart is fuckin' broken
Outspoken, hold this album like a lucky token

[Scratch Hook]
When the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
I'll travel to the end of the universe and beyond
No sense of place, lost without a trace
I'm a man, that's on the mission
When the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
I'll travel to the end of the universe and beyond
No sense of place, lost in outer space
I'm a man's man, that's on the mission
