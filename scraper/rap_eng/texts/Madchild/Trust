[Verse 1] Prevail

This reminds me of Michael Myers
First scene in Halloween extremely violent
You know my team gonna triumph
Push a butcher knife, all-star line up
Assassins with hearts of sand, mechanical claws and blades for hands
Stephen King, Clive Barker, Wes Craven, John Carpenter
Pawns on the chess board, heart rate monitor
Pythagorean theorem, Madchild's a python, donâ€™t go near him
Rob the Viking, direct descendant of Eric the Red
This record's independent
Either way the main frame deep lock with the daedalus
Built for the minotaur, bear the same resemblance
I [?] dormant slow, save your moon colored scarlet, orbit low

[Hook] Madchild
Shadows in the evening, we believe in trust
Loyalty, the honorable provide, join us
My people are down deep, I keep them around me, we crush
Shadows in the evening, we believe in trust
Loyalty, the honorable provide, join us
My people are down deep, I keep them around me, we crush

[Verse 2] Madchild

I'm an abstract expressionist
Aggressive pain from possessiveness
Crack your shell, warlock cast a spell
Otherwise it's back to hell
Cured by faith, seal my fate
You don't just want some food
You wanna steal my plate
You whisper with the hiss of a snake, It gets deep
You're the reason that my wrist are twisted when I sleep
No soft spot, rotten from the inside out
Your sick, it's called soul searching, try it out
Protect what's mine, protect what's yours
Threats of course will be met by force
But I don't need enemies, I need inner peace
Galaga, Gauntlet, Pac-Man, Centipede
I'm confused in my passenger
Self absorbed in this musical massacre

[Hook] Madchild
Shadows in the evening, we believe in trust
Loyalty, the honorable provide, join us
My people are down deep, I keep them around me, we crush
Shadows in the evening, we believe in trust
Loyalty, the honorable provide, join us
My people are down deep, I keep them around me, we crush

[Verse 3]

[Madchild]
Flashes of bad faces, murderous half whispered
Scheming in dark corners, Mad is a good listener

[Prevail]
Classicals outrageous future remains twisted
Dreaming of more order, Prev is his own prisoner

[Madchild]
Warm welcoming entrance, heavy adult sentence
Intentional incentive, the devil's apprentice

[Prevail]
Calm mellowing vengeance deadens your senses
The sentinels relentless of venomous friendships

[Hook] Madchild
Shadows in the evening, we believe in trust
Loyalty, the honorable provide, join us
My people are down deep, I keep them around me, we crush
Shadows in the evening, we believe in trust
Loyalty, the honorable provide, join us
My people are down deep, I keep them around me, we crush
