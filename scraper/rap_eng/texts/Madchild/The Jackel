[Verse 1]

Yo, I changed my habitat to palm trees from tabernac
Now I’m pullin' playboy bunnies just like a rabbit trap
White boy, looking like an angry tatted cabbage patch
That flies economy, but Lola’s got a Gucci travelbag!
Lone ranger, back on the saddle with satin saddlebags
And two chrome platinum battleaxe's that cattle brand
I don’t battlerap as I shadowcast
Attack a pack of cackling jackals to watch them scatter fast!
I got a new girl, who knows how long that’ll last?
Wants me to tie her up, but said I have to put the paddle back
Master of the universe, He-man, I’m back on battlecat
Mad’ll rap — circles around these rappers, hold your bladder back!
I sabotage and camouflage and cause an avalanche
So call an ambulance, while this track keep playin a mandolin
Scrambling these words together, no one fucks with fancy pants
I'm vain as fuck, can't walk by a mirror without a handsome glance!

[Hook]
I’m a sick and twisted midget with invisible friends
I cut like scissors with precision while you’re miserably vague
I mutilate the master, leave them physically dead
Some rappers run away from me like I’m a biblical plague
Sometimes I paint my face like juggalos and twisted sister
Eleven on the richtor, sick-o, I’m a triple twister
What comes around, goes around Ill close you down clown
Lyrics they keep circling your head, like Bose surround sound!

[Verse 2]

Okay, remain sober, insane cobra, the evil green dragon
Pain’s over, white range rover, to silver G wagon
I watch for new popular acts like I got binoculars
Cause one day, my shit is gonna end like the apocalypse!
But ‘til then, rapper fuck around he’s getting stamped out
Devil ain’t just knocking on my door, he’s fucking camped out!
Would someone please tell Lucifer I’m back to being a recluse again?
Every night I pray to God with Jesus on the crucifix!
And I don’t want no problems, but the little Goblin’s gone legit
No disrespect, but following your path, my life has gone to shit!
And even though I’m dope as barrels full of coke and heroine
I’m happy being clean and flying straighter than an arrow is!
The devil’s laughing, while these rappers buy his hollow dreams
Me? I’m down with juggalos, paint our faces like Halloween!
Cellar dweller, you're Helen Keller, I am Skeletor
My juggernaut gone in 60 seconds like an Eleanor!

[Hook]
I’m a sick and twisted midget with invisible friends
I cut like scissors with precision while you’re miserably vague
I mutilate the master, leave them physically dead
Some rappers run away from me like I’m a biblical plague
Sometimes I paint my face like juggalos and twisted sister
Eleven on the richtor, sick-o, I’m a triple twister
What comes around, goes around Ill close you down clown
Lyrics they keep circling your head, like Bose surround sound!

[Verse 3]

Ayo I’m doper than a barrel in a boat
Full of heroin and coke
Still I’m straighter than an arrow in a bow!
My style’s beautiful like Marilyn Monroe
But I’m more like Charlie Manson, when I’m tearin out your throat!
Once you get a buzz, if you lose it, it’s hard to get it back
So I’m working seven days a week while tryin to keep my head intact
So many rappers now, don’t matter if you’re twice as dope
Tryna' ride a rusty bicycle back up an icy slope!
But due to due diligence the new villain of dooms not through killing it
Dude, I’m to militant
When I get in the zone, I’m an abstract evil poet
And I’m still yet to have my time, I think the people know it!
I’m in the Barker Lounge coming up with a darker sound
Hellhounds, and demons in my head, my dogs are barking now!
It’s fun to beast but gotta leave the ego out of it
Hit the kids with love, cause that’ll beat the evil out of'em
Backpack rapper, I am underground, it’s pretty basic
Just get a pad and pen and smokes and find a dirty basement
Little devil, I rap for angels with dirty faces
They come from hurting places, feel it when I’m blurting statements!

[Hook]
I’m a sick and twisted midget with invisible friends
I cut like scissors with precision while you’re miserably vague
I mutilate the master, leave them physically dead
Some rappers run away from me like I’m a biblical plague
Sometimes I paint my face like juggalos and twisted sister
Eleven on the richtor, sick-o, I’m a triple twister
What comes around, goes around Ill close you down clown
Lyrics they keep circling your head, like Bose surround sound!
