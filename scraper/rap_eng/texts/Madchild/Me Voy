(Intro) MadChild
Yeah, fuck all this bullshit, man
I ain't tryna please you
I'm tryna please myself
Happiness is the key to life

(Verse 1) MadChild
Yo, fuck this shit I'm outta here, feel like I don't belong, boy
Even when I'm feel I'm doing right, they say I'm wrong, boy
Used to roll in convoys.. man, I had a lot of friends, we were troubled, look at all the fuckin' shit it got us in
Had a self-destructive life, finally tried to change it, now everybody I called bro, nothin' but some strangers
Co-called friends ain't turn their back, so I just turned my back for good, and ain't comin' back, my life is rapping, now my life is good
I'm not tryna please you, I don't fuckin' need you (Haha)
Your arrogance transparent, all this bullshit I can see through
You want me to sit and talk some shit like we the hardest crew
They ain't done a thing to me, I'm just an artist who.. wants to just be left alone
Pen, pad, microphone.. me, my dog, I'm reclusive
Why? Because I like my home
I don't give a damn about your stereotypes 'cause now I'm happy in a sun, you cats are very uptight

(Hook) Joseph Rose
It's hard not to become what everyone expects
So many images, opinions, differences, guilty by association 'n shit
But who gives a shit?
Finger-fuck the world and no one even harder
All the symbolism made my smarter
Propaganda and aerobic in japanese
This is bullshit, I have to leave

(Verse 2) Eros
Let me have a little dip in a water, the planet weight heavy on the shoulders, hold up
Everybody run around like a track meat, only one it was a bitch in a bad beat
Breathin' in and out, fuckin' with the bass tone, that's right, baby, tell 'em 'cause I ain't a clone
Close to my heart, hard to my main vein, maintain, heavy.. just rains, pass by planes
I escaped from this shit to move sentences symphonic synthesis, sink-sink slowly, with a day-dream thoughts in an instance, rainbow color third eye like inzens
Equip were conspicuously directed lawless, this is dope lyrical in a more over awesomeness
So I gotta brake free from the rat race, stack the light and move out.. uuuhhhhhh
And it drifts so far away, I'm in love
Wait a feeling that a /?/, I'm out there
Hit me like a tornado, yap right there.. uuhhhhhhhhh
And I know that most of us feel the same and I can't stop, won't stop, take it to the edge, far away from the bullshit
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

(Hook) Joseph Rose
It's hard not to become what everyone expects

(Verse 3) Aesthetic Deliverance
I keep hearin' all these people tellin' me I shouldn't do this, I was hearin' the same people sayin' you shouldn't do that
Shut your mouth and relax, this ain't a debate on a panel.. I'm the chim another borden, I can throw with them ravels
You don't wanna get in my way, my blood line chiba, distraction displayed, I have no mercy when you fuck with my day
Didn't asked for your opinions and theories, okay?
And usually I'm quite a nice guy but you test my patience when you keep tryna twilight
Why you wanna get a lap in my business, you keep grillin' me with questions (What is this?)
The way that I see it, I submit to none..
I need a pen and a pad and snare and a kick drum, I keep quiet and I said to my own I had a small group of friends, some kicks on the microphone
And you know what's all up.. but fuck, I can't keep up with a who did what, the he said, she said, they said.. whatever
So I just do me and perceive with my endeavors, I do what I like, fuck a status-quo
I like what I do and continue to grow, it's not a question of what you think you know
But in my opinion your vision is hollow

(Cuts)
I'm not tryna please you (MadChild)
And you know what's all up.. but fuck (Aesthetic Deliverance)
Everybody run around like a track meat (Eros)
But who gives a shit? (Joseph Rose)
Fuck the world (Joseph Rose)
I can't keep up, can't keep up.. with a who did what
(Aesthetic Deliverance)
Happiness is the key to life (MadChild)
