[Verse 1: A-O]
Hey can you hear the devil talking ?
He walked in your apartment without knockin
Hey better lock your door
Sharpen the sword then it's off to war
No I'm not on tour, I'm in the basement
That's how my days spent, chasing dreams
That seem close I can taste it
Man I'm blowing up like a spaceship
Face it, life's more than a paycheck
Life is a canvas ,it takes patience to paint it
Yea ,Now I'm lost in the matrix
The red or blue pill ? Which one am I takin ?
Eh maybe I'll take em both
Before the devil raped my soul I had no place to go
When it rains it pours and now it's pourin
The flames in my veins was red but now they orange

[Hook: Madchild]
Before you rebuild your life you have to tear it down
The body wrapped around my soul is slowly wearing down
I ain't trying turn it up, I'm trying to tear it down
Motherfucker I will tear shit down
I'm a dragon among dwarfs
I'm a dragon among dwarfs
I'm a dragon among dwarfs
Motherfucker I will tear shit down

[Verse 2: Madchild]
Ok, the devil tries to lure me to the darkside often
Hopes to take my soul once I'm inside my coffin
Burning in eternal flames, that's the price you have to pay
Had to pump my breaks cause I am just a couple laughs away
Three or four bad turns , half a dozen wrong decisions
That will be the longest sentence in a dark and haunted prison
So every night I pray to God to make it through the night
I'm not blaming anyone, a beautiful and brutal life
And I'm not sure if I misunderstood or I am mentor
But yet to let myself break out and reach my full potential
Your heart, it will be literally pounding
Legitimacy of my literacy is astounding
I cannot afford to lose the hunger that's inside
They try to suck the life out of my veins and kill my vibe
They try to suck the life out of my blood and kill my drive
But they will not succeed because my spirit never dies

[Hook: Madchild]
Before you rebuild your life you have to tear it down
The body wrapped around my soul is slowly wearing down
I ain't trying turn it up, I'm trying to tear it down
Motherfucker I will tear shit down
I'm a dragon among dwarfs
I'm a dragon among dwarfs
I'm a dragon among dwarfs
Motherfucker I will tear shit down

[Verse 3: Intrinzik]
I will tear shit down making holes inside your foundation
Deep inside the rabbit hole are screams of belly sound vacant
Brains and empty souls, my control's always groundbreaking
The devil in you gotta [?] hallucinations
Take these mushrooms and these tubs of acid
We're going somewhere you can access on your tablet or your apple gadget
This is the journey to the deepest level of your soul
If nothing looks familiar it's because you never go
[?]
And the contracts are made to keep your knots in some place
We are smashing over boundaries, spacing tab and writing half
Defying gravity now tell me how you liking that
I am a dragon off the wagon shit is crystal clear
My life's eternal shape shifting heel in switching gears

[Hook: Madchild]
Before you rebuild your life you have to tear it down
The body wrapped around my soul is slowly wearing down
I ain't trying turn it up, I'm trying to tear it down
Motherfucker I will tear shit down
I'm a dragon among dwarfs
I'm a dragon among dwarfs
I'm a dragon among dwarfs
Motherfucker I will tear shit down
