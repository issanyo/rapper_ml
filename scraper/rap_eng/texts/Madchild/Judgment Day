Everybody's running with their heads down
Listen to countdown
Like it's judgment day!
Stepping on each other like it's no proud
They're gonna find out
On judgment day!

Yo yo, I'm from van city
That's the city of rain, I'm from van city
That's the city of pain
My girl is damn pretty, and I am willy insane
I mean, it's really a shame
Cause she's down for me
But I'm complicated like a wicked cube
Without my girl I'd probably make a lot of stupid moves
But without my family, I'd probably wouldn't be here
I'm dope, but I quit doing dope
While I see clear, I see clearest day
Can I hear a hey?
Now, I'ma smile it when I look into the mirror
(Hey!) I'm walking to the light, throw your fear away!
(Hey!) I'm scheming, tell the demon he gets zero play!
We don't need a lot of money, homie we're OK
Fresh clear, nice clear, homie we're OK
Back home, feels great, had to relocate
They do, thank you
I'll be here all day!

Everybody's running with their heads down
Listen to countdown
Like it's judgment day!
Stepping on each other like it's no proud
They're gonna find out
On judgment day!

Just last year, I was in a dark place
Going fast by the crash, like a car chase
Every time I saw cops, make my heart race
Cause every friend I had thought that he was Scarface
My life was spinning out of control
Undoubtedly, to proud to know how to be told
They shout at me loud, til I was out in the cold
Fire fuse passed, I don't know how to be old
Now I'm faced with the willing, I'm familiar truth
And my face walked down from all of the abuse
Know my place, inspiration, now they need the truth
I think about the inflammation that we'd think of you
I should be dead, wouldn't say it
If it isn't true
A lot of people that I know are now in prison too
Bad dreams, war scars, with the missing tooth
But everyone of us can change
I am the living proof

Everybody's running with their heads down
Listen to countdown
Like it's judgment day!
Stepping on each other like it's no proud
They're gonna find out
On judgment day!

Walls are burning down
The walls are burning down
The walls are burning down
The walls are burning down (let it burn!)
