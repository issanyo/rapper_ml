Live long love life
Never know when shit can go from wrong to going right
So go ahead, tell ‘em all how we live this shit
Tell ‘em all how we live this shit, alright

We doing this all day
Bad boy, I was sent out of class to the hallway
Most unlikely to succeed, god damnit we parlay
Now we reaching on some things they told us was far away
Floppity flopping my shows is floppity flopping
I step my giggity game up but now we poppitypoppinizing
That liquidylaquo they always talkity talking
But I don’t shoot the shit I’m better off just cockity cockin
These fucking raps back with my map out, I don’t ever really act out
Cause the words that I be writing just the dream I had to map out
I’m the singy happy rappy guy, my momma raised me right
I just kill ‘em with some manners right before we say goodnight
Right before we’re taking flight
Hold up
I wish a homie might
So what
‘Cause nothing more inviting than the feel I got today
I just look them in the eye, get the fuck up out my way, hold up

Live long love life
Never know when shit can go from wrong to going right
So go ahead, tell ‘em all how we live this shit
Tell ‘em all how we live this shit, alright (x2)

Buddy I’d be buddied out, I ain’t your fucking buddy
Funny how you treating Sunny after I became somebody
I was leaning on a ??,  feeling like a loser
So I shot some videos and now these girls they say I’m cuter
I just tell her that she too too, poppin off like do-do
That shit was so Kendrick but I meant it yeah I’m cuckoo
Is just do to all them boo-boos that I made when I was new to this
Game that you watch on YouTube now we off them books like joo joo
Boy I’m bonkers you should know that
Lock myself into a room and wrote the realest shit you ever heard without a notepad
Rappers steady killing man they acting ????
??? All that we do smoking your rhymes we gon’ know that
Went from most antici-hated to the most antici-rated
So I got my ass up to the club and got antici-faded
Even when I make it I probably won’t say I made it
That’s just something ‘bout my liz-ife
See that now I’ll tell you like

Live long love life
Never know when shit can go from wrong to going right
So go ahead, tell ‘em all how we live this shit
Tell ‘em all how we live this shit, alright (x2)

Madchild, as a kid I had to go anger management
Psychopathic tendancies and issues from abandonment
Bar-Barbarian, slay like I’m Spartacus
I break bones cause nerve damage, you twist cartilage
My look is nautical, black ? and a cartigan
Genuine article and I smash skulls to particles
I’m still a bounty hunter like I’m Boba Fet
Spooky with this nuclear weaponry, I’m a global threat
And I’ma tell you when it’s over it ain’t over yet
Monster with a body of a jaguar and a cobra’s head
We’re all just descended to no one and I’m the sickest poet
I’m ‘bout to take over Los Angeles like Mickey Cohen
‘Cause I could kill a fucking man like Sen Dog
Madchild, looking like a tattooed Ken Doll
I’ma light a second torch and pass this shit to SonReal
Fuck with him, fuck with me
Consider that a done deal

Live long love life
Never know when shit can go from wrong to going right
So go ahead, tell ‘em all how we live this shit
Tell ‘em all how we live this shit, alright (x2)

When we wake in the morning it ain’t gotta be boring
We can start it all over
‘Cause lately I ain’t been thinking I’ve been floating ‘round dreaming
I’ll be back in October
And I’ll be
I’ll be around for you
Singing it loud to you
I’ll hold it down for you
Look what we found for you, singing

Tell the world what the fuck we ‘bout to do
‘Cause I probably wouldn’t do it if it wasn’t all for you
Hold up
Yell it out like you mean it from your heart
I just want to feel that feeling when we felt it from the start
Shout out
Live long love life
Never know when shit can go from wrong to going right
We all have that crazy in the butt back of our mind
I just let it out let it out like every time I rhyme, mothafucking rights
This here my shit, turn it up loud wake the whole damn crib
Everything I did made me everything I didn’t
Everything I wasn’t made me everything I is so I’m jotting off
Live long love life
Live long love life
Live long love life
Live long love life
