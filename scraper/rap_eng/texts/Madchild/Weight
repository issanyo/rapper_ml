[Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, yo
Ayo my cocaine's whiter than Colgate
And when Christ come, I'mma go relocate
Finish off them dimes, big slabs of crack lighting my gangsta's will
Bury me at the plate in Bronx Bombers' field
Give my young guards the four horses
My baby girls get the pink Porches
Dookie gems and they're all gorgeous
King Tone had a mean fortress
A French maid blowin' me down like Fara Fawcett
My gun collection is big in the Adolf section
My little mini me, he bump off the Mexicans
Mostly known for my earlobe
Four million dollar disco ball, shit dope
My wrist cut bang glass on the crystal floor
At Club Shiznit with romy roam just came home
Violate a parole selling cell phones, with a Snoop Dogg perm
His brother puffs sherm through two and big worm

[Hook 2X: The Alchemist]
Weight, my my my money fold up
Uh, my my my pockets swolled up
Say what, say what, just roll up
What's the hold up, unload and reload up

[Prevail]
Hell fire (hell fire), Hamburger Hill shell fire
Kill quiet like a knife on the front line, private
Live riot stage show, verse burn, flamethrow
Overthrow, take over, name known around the globe
King cobra, poison slow fang, jungle overgrown
Wu-Tang, Ghostface, Alchemist killing the song
Top billing, feeling famous, chopping heads, rock iller

[Madchild]
Comic villain on painkillers watching Good Fellas
Dancing in the dungeon all by myself
I say I think I'm going crazy, that's a cry for help
My phone don't ring but get sexy text messages
Gun under my couch, thoughts of bitches mud wrestling
Me I'm just chillin' with killers at my disposal
I have a feeling you will accept my proposal
Put another dime in the jukebox, I love rock 'n roll
Bulletproof vest, Glock, lock 'n load

[Hook 2X: The Alchemist]
Weight, my my my money fold up
Uh, my my my pockets swolled up
Say what, say what, just roll up
What's the hold up, unload and reload up

[The Alchemist]
Rap zombie I'm controlled by powers beyond me
I go from the drum machine straight to the DVD
To the hard drive, to the G5, to the computer screen
To the lab through the speakers to the pens and the pads
To the science, to the math, to the vocab
Straight to the vocal booth, to the mic, back to that old rap
Through the speakers to the place where your heart and your soul at
Drop out the drums, rough mix, straight to the work that
Bounce the track to disc format and then burn that
To the CD, we take it to the truck where the systems at
Make sure the bass hit like a thunderclap
Then I double back to the lab fast like I was running laps
I freeze, back to the Digi D to an MP3
Through the internet freeway, straight to the DJ
Straight to the radio, constant airplay
I gotta keep food on my plate
So I'm moving that

[Hook 2X: The Alchemist]
Weight, my my my money fold up
Uh, my my my pockets swolled up
Say what, say what, just roll up
What's the hold up, unload and reload up
