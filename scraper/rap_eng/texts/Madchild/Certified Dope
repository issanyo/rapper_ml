[Verse One] [Mad Child]:
I'm certified dope
What a fine flow
Wouldn't mind gettin mine. Where do I go?
Straight to the top
But what if I don't?
I'm not kiddin'. I'm slitting my throat, man
I'm bullshitting. Ain't gettin' that low
Nothing gonna stop me from gettin' my dough
Did I--did I--st-st-stutter, motherfucker?
I ain't tryin to lose. I'm not like these other suckers
I'm fresh to death. I'm way too clean
Nothings gonna stop us. Know what I mean?
Know what I mean? Know what I mean?
I'm fresh to death. Know what I mean?

[Verse Two] [Prevail]:
Stamp of approval. Your camp is removable
The champion of amplified sound. Make it beautiful
What do you think you're doing limiting my vision?
I stomp you with my DC's limited edition
Give me a rhythm. I hit 'em harder than Tyson
With a rhyme I'm reciting
I'm shining bright like a brightlen
Hold my mic like a knife. Start slashing and slicing
Cold as snow when it falls. Yes, y'all, I can ice 'em

[Mad Child]:
Ya hear the verdict?

Get murdered by words that I wrote no joke
Ayo

Get murdered by words that I wrote. No joke, that's right
Ayo ya heard it? I'm certified dope
Get smoked by 35 guys on coke
Get broke by dirty white guys on dope
My folks are pretty hype-wired on dope
My strobe light pretty fat wired on dope
So I'm not ready for bedy-by no
Bedy by by bedy by by bo
I'm pretty fly for a white guy on dope
There's guys gettin high in my video so
I wouldn't mind tryin why shouldn't I yo?
Hey yippie yi-yo yippie yi-yi-yo
I'm flipping, I'm tripping, I'm skippin by you

No tellin what the hell a high mind might do
From Van to Hong Kong down to Kathmandu
My brain go blam blam while I gangbang you
