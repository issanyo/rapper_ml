Thirty five years old, you are not young
Second blast from this double barrel shotgun
I got five years on you, not a long road
Now this muppet Gonzo has turned us to a gun show
A milion rappers older than me and they ain't retired yet
Think you're spittin' flames, I'm a fuckin' fire hydrant
I'm vibrant, a werewolf and a vampire, a hybrid
Your diss  is just regurgitating everything that I've said
In songs, I'm always making fucking fun of myself
But just so wonderful, so now I'm breathin' thunder from hell
My teeth fucked up? You're right, I am not perfect
But you can't match fuckin' venom from this dark serpent
Don't really got lots of dirt on this bird chirpin'
Neva followed yo career cuz yo shit's hurtin'
I don't record calls and don't expose messages
That's a bitch, check the levels of your estrogen
If you had street cred instead of being cryin' bitches
You would know that people died for that, it's dry snitchin'
Gangsta with that bat as you smashin' that car's windows
You feelin' heat from that corner that you've backed into
Tryna' steal my Enterprise, I get Star Trek
Perfect video, that diss it was a car wreck
No turnin' back, you made a brash decision
Every time you see me now would be a crash collision
The Kracken's risen now this little crackhead's pissin'
Cause I got homies ready to go back to prison
My vibe is spreading like I'm radioactive
You ain't a tough guy you are a Canadian actress
Had to use my name to finally get a reaction
You're Glenn Close and this is Fatal Attraction
Matt's your roommate that's one cunt and one pussy
Keep an eye out for one runt in your bushes
Old life trying hard not to get back into
But one snap of my fingers its that simple
I've learned from my past
Those that talk about it ain't about it
You should do somthing 'stead just complain 'bout it
Stop attending with your vengance and blurb
Seen this movie already its revenge of the nerds
I'm demented and inventive when assembling words
Leave you trembling resembeling a gremlins turd
Got a skull with two axes crossed before you started rapping
Square mask with two baseball bats crossed what happend there
Tell the truth are you hater or a stan fan
Seems like you are infatuated with me you're a man damn
Walk soft and carry a big stick I'm Bam Bam
Pull up in a Trans am and pull out then blam blam
Fourty diss me bout my age so stupid it's astonishing
How old you think your favourite older brother rappers Onyx is
Snak probably thinks about me and has ejaculations
Tell the truth dawg whats with the infatuation
Everybody is gon' jump ship evacuation
Got my haters all to hate me, congratulations
My story's out there for the world to hear
It's hard to write about a rapper that has no career
And I ain't calling people on the phone to get that jucy gossip
I ain't doing videos with memes and fucking goofy topics
I should kill you for that line about that roofy drop it
And put a bullet trough you face for such a gruesome rotten
Thing to say
I warned you about the kids movement
We're supposed to be role models for improvement
Careful now cause we could be labeled by gang squad
Last four years I've done nothing but just thank God
I've helped thousands of people get off drugs, what have you done?
Helped out a charity you guys do any food runs?
And what about the ones that's helpless little kids
You never stop to think about them you selfish piece of shit
Your crew's buzzing around you like some ignorant flies
I got thousands of fans thanking me for saving their lives
I feel like its the apocalypse thats where this is headed
I fight for the God you're Satan we have reached armageddon
Thats why they call you snake, Im gona have to behead him
The evil that you spilt out its past me forgetten
Snak its on your sholder if we end up having homicides
I cut the head of the snake and than the body dies
You ain't woried bout the kids and their safety
You just filled with rage and jealousy and how much you hate me
Never even crossed my mind in a negative way
Until you went on facebook talking shit that day
Called you on the phone while sitting with Dow Jones
Asked you if you tought you're better than me and you said no
Had you on the speakerphone he heard every word of it
One year later now you acting like you're murderous
Remember texting me and sayin' you are in a bad place
Once again i said no problem, we all have bad days
Then I write a tweet cause that shit out in Ontario
Talking shit about me to my bros that wanna bury you
But than i took that tweet down and told my self just let it be
But you've been wating so long for me to slip and get at me
And I dont really care if you get wasted and obnoxious
That's your persona but tired of hearing you talk shit
That apology, that was for the children
And the movements that we both work so hard to build with
Cause I don't wanna see kids fighting over a rap war
Not Stompdown Killers and not BAX WAR
If it happens you'll get more than a cracked jaw
Come in your back door and cut your head off with a hacksaw
And jack you but you ain't even got a rack saved
In the afterlife you're gonna be my rap slave
Too long to respond, look at the balls on this knob
Dawg, you forgot that i actually have a job
While you sit at home alone wating for Perry to call
So you can carry bags and hold the door for Fredro Starr
Feel sorry for the kids that dont belive in this guy
Big bad Snak won't even see the kid eye to eye
You live in a lie, you know that i've got the evilest mind
The demon that rhymes that face to face can bury the life
Couldn't win a round against me in KOTD
Get in front a camera tho and say you're a G
You say it's for the pay I say I do it for free
For charity, and still you're scared
That's a pussy to me
