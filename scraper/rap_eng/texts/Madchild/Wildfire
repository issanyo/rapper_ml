[Verse 1]
Ayo, I’m bathing in a bath of blood, my mind’s vacant
Palms out sweaty and my hands start shaking
Barbershop razor in the bathroom naked
Looking in the mirror thinking I can’t take it
That was in the past, now I’m back with a vengeance
Freak, I’m the last of the Mohican injins
I’m John Dillenger running on six cylinders
I will rape and pillage and kill villages
I’m militant, with ill intent, a warmonger
My hunger, strong, I bring more thunder
Monstrosity, I’m awfully out there
My voice threatening, I’m mentally out there
Psycho killer with the mask on, that strong
But now I’ve had a change of heart, hope it last long
Rappers full of fucking shit, making bottles pop
Transforming like Decepticons and Autobots

[Hook]
I’m on a rampage
I’m on a rampage
Muhfucka, I’m on a rampage
Last Mohican, I’m a blood thirsty savage

[Verse 2]
You don’t want to fuck me boy, I’m too crazy
Eyes all lit up and my words start blazing
Sublime animal, fine young cannibal
Catapult a ball and I’m flying, I fire cannon balls
Blood spiller, I stomp like Godzilla
Fraud killer, black magical vaudevillian
Never been a ducky boy, Mad’s an outsider
Plans of blowing up still like I’m Al-Qaeda
Bax Warriors, clan so serious
Like a gang of Siberians
Attack like a pack of wolves, we want rampant
I can read your thoughts like a pamphlet
Underground champion, I could fill the room up with magic
Once it is consumed, get consumed by my madness
Sort of tired, black flat jackets and mortifier
Borderline schizophrenia, I’m more than horrifying

[Hook]
I’m on a rampage
I’m on a rampage
Muhfucka, I’m on a rampage
Last Mohican, I’m a blood thirsty savage

[Verse 3]
Cro-Magnon, 44 magnum
Glorified bragger, I’m a fortified dragon
You’re a fucking dandelion, I’m an angry lion
In a rage, veins bulging out my neck while strangling iron
On stage, scalp a rapper ‘cause I’m lyrical
Last of the Mohicans, spirit of the Iroquois
Massive weight, I fascinate, so drop dead
Caffeinate, then I decapitate, I chop heads
Nothing you can do to me, I bust bars brutally
Mentally I’m fucked, ain’t no one getting through to me
Slice like a bear claw, killers on a payroll
They bite like Cujo and shoot like Halo
I put myself on house arrest without an ankle bracelet
‘Cause being a crazy fucking psychopath is my occupation
I’ve gone Hollywood. Sunset in Horn Ave
New bitch looking like the cover of a porn ad

[Hook]
I’m on a rampage
I’m on a rampage
Muhfucka, I’m on a rampage
Last Mohican, I’m a blood thirsty savage
