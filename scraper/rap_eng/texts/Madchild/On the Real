(For real though)

[Verse 1] Madchild
No need to flex ‘cause I wrecks with the lyrical throw down
A showdown, with me you’ll need a miracle
Rip on the flipside, spin the wheel of fortune
Swarming like a bunch of [?], culture shock is scorching
Writing what I’m writing then enliven with my pick
I’ll shish kebab your ass like a piranha on a stick
Quick to inject the vinyl venom in your system
Got a lot of problems, I’ll be pissed I need to list them
Your style sucks dick, uh, your crew sucks dick
You’re sucking so much I’m about to cum quick
I spunk from the junk that you think is hunky-dory
Fucking punk, your funky stories from the kiddie category
I knocked your socks off. (You know It)
Made you f-feel bad, but I’m glad I got my rocks off
Wannabes are going to see me and what they should be
Could be they’re trying to battle Shane B
Would be senseless like a game of 52 pickup
I could slide and ride the rhythm even if I got the hiccups
Stick up your hands ‘cause I’m taking you for everything you've got
And I’ll say “thanks a lot”
I’m pulling your leg if I say I know just how you feel
And that’s on the real

[Verse 2]

Rev up the reel, my rhymes are on idol
Speaking for real on the rhythm, check the title
I think they make you [?] facts, jack
You never see me front because I always watch my back
Attack, black [?] beast when I release, my pressure
Yes sir, you the second guesser, professor
No lesser, listen to my lesson
Put up your hands please don’t question my ability
Facilities, I rock to a tee
Don’t blame me for casualties
What’s it got to do with me?
Nothing honey
Come on, money
No fun. What's up? Is it that time of the month?
What? [?]
You can sing to this but all I have to do is butt
Hey mister, get out the picture, I mean get out the frame
Show you why I can't get my name to you
Damn, my man, are you really gonna step on my shoes
Even though they're no suede, you be singing me the blues
[?] took it
Look at, give it here, give it back
Gimme, gimme never gets
Shut up you backseat riders, I'm at the wheel
And I ain't from the hill, but I can still be real
