[Intro: Swisha-T]
Yo, it’s yo boy Swish
Swisha!

[Verse 1: Swisha-T]
Yo, see I'm the last of a dying breed
I don’t need no other nigga to define me
I spit a high free and huddle when the piff is in
Fuck a beat box I let my rhythm be the instrument
I don’t wanna bid, I want the whole enchilada
My haze from outer space so Imma blow from Nicaragua
I love my Mary Jane you can call me Peter Parker
I flow so fucking cold, so you’ll probably need a parka
Pussy little rappers I’ll diminish you and finish you
Hang you by your tennis shoes, you kids belong in middle school
Why you trying to pick fight with a red nose pick
With a Kendo Stick, and a bomb the size of Kimbo's fist
Imma end your shit
All you rappers trying to be me
Ya'll don’t possess that raw talent, you just rhyme to a beat
Y’all a'int grimy as street
See I'm sharper than a poison arrow
I load the barrel, cock it back, leave your boys in peril
I'm ill and twisted, you bitches can bear witness
My lyrical terrorism is sick and it scare children
I'm spitting fire, the meanest, I'm sick and tired of beefing
From getting high on the weekends, I'm fucking fly and I'm tweaking
I mean, I need a package of swishas or something sticky
Im mad at the thugs and piggies I’m eating, there’s nothing biggie

[Verse 2: Madchild]
I’m the judge, I'm the jury, I'm the motherfucking chancellor
Creeping through your mind like I'm a fucking black tarantula
Razor sharp, going for the neck like I'm a vampire
Things about to transpire, hotter than a campfire
I'm coming up so stack the money in my bank higher
Open up my mouth I’ll let the missile from the tank fire
Life is full of glory and danger, a warrior angel
I'm notorious, my story is painful
I went looking for the trouble I'm a motherfucking wild boy
Open up my mouth but you don’t wanna look inside boy
You lyricists, I'm serious, when making dope appearances
Look into the clearance, there’s a lot of interference
There appears to be inferior complex
Interior bomb threat, exterior is nearly a combat
Delusionally optimistic, drop the biscuit
Now I've got a pot to piss in, even opposition listens
[Yeah] I'm an annihilist, that triumph over scientists
Rely on this cause I'm a fucking lion with an iron fist
Cowards get devoured I'm a powerful vulture
I skate through life like I was [?]
Kilometers on my speedometer, I'm a phenomenon
Too hot for a thermometer
The top is where I'm climbing up
Lyrically I'm like an evil, lichen full of blood lust
Mad'll bust you open I am doper than a drug bust
I make a rapper lose it like a disimbowment
Cause every verse I spit is a magnificent endowment
