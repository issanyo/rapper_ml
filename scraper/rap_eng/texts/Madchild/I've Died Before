[Verse 1: Rite Hook]
I wanna eighty , who said that, my brain maybe
But it felt like another personality, yellin' at me
Am I crazy cause I seen some shit
Ponderin' the ultimate, thoughts in a evil grip
Kick the routine on an even scale
Cause if I'm sick I'll fuck you up for a piece of a pill
Started off sweet, now it's like I'm needing to steal
Never wanted to do it but better believe I will
I would wake up like [?]
Strike one now I gotta call up that dude on you
Said I wanted one but I had the cash [?]
That's strike two, fuck strike three I'm tryin' to shoot a few
Hah now my only option is to pull off it and hopefully get a gold watch and bunch of necklaces
And if I don't, I robbing Flacco for a whole bundle of dope and poppin' skin

[Hook]
The world's so different from me, I can feel a
Change comin' over me, I don't feel the same
When I've tried before
Still have a tough time looking in the mirror
Still sweatin' like a pig, I can feel the flame
It's like I've died before


[Verse 2: Madchild]
I'm a cheater, a liar, a zombie, a monster
Droolin' on my couch, watchin' flicks barely conscious
Cigarette burns on my clothes, on my boxers
Drop seven grand on a bag full of Oxys
Touched by an angel
Then you wake up depressed on a cold planet
Hidin' in the corner, I was laughin' at myself
I'm a one weight, third class passenger to hell
Yeah I'm self destructive, I'm castin' up a spell
Lying bastard, mentally a disaster you can tell
Broken teeth, overweight, and my lips are purple
Madchild, I am stuck in this vicious circle
Those aren't no damn mashed potatoes aight
Another fuckin' day that I have stayed up all night
Strippers and coke, I got dudes who will murder for me
Now I feel like a bottom feeder stuck in purgatory

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rite Hook]
I'm stuck in rut with no luck
Left with myself in a world with no trust
And I'll never get it back, that's what it seems like
Sleepin' in the shelter, least it ain't the street lettin' sleet pelt ya
Please help yourself, that's what they're sayin' to me
Screamin' it, losin' what you have, I'm achievin' it
My hearts barely beating in the year that I'm breathin'
[?]
What's the definition of relief, I tell ya
A five minute rush but it don't last forever
Yah now you feel better but you'll never get ahead of what you're runnin' from
Just piles up right front of him
Someone's gotta play the game and bat 400
At least that's what I think, I'm really buggin'
Getting thrown out before I get to first base
What's it gonna take to get out of the rat race

[Hook X2]
