[Chorus 1] Mr. Vegas
Mi seh mi feeling mellow
Under mi indica
Under mi indica
Mi indica

Seh mi feeling mellow
Under mi indica
Under mi indica
Under the indica

When mi under High grade
When mi under My grade
When mi under de Best grade
WHen mi under, West grade

[Verse 1] Prevail
Reefer Madness, Keef and Black Hash
A little bit of oil on the paper I like that
Come on man light that
The Amsterdam Flame, NYC Diesel, Cali Kush to the Brain
So many strains and my life so chill
Take a bong load, listen to some cypress hill
My mind is filled, head space stays creative
Music plays in my skull 'till I re-create it

[Verse 2] Madchild
Don't Make me angry (why?)
My skin go green
Blam! throw man through the window screen
Love me or hate me no in between
All my friends grow indo in BC
Get so high, heart can't take it
Walk through my house with a sharp knife naked
I'm paranoid and I can't stop shakin'
Now it's all good though I smoke Jamaican

[Chorus 2] Mr. Vegas
Mi seh mi feeling mellow
Under mi indica
Under mi indica
Mi indica

Seh mi feeling mellow
Under mi indica
Under mi indica
Under the indica

When mi under High grade
When mi under My grade
When mi under de Greenest grade
I like Mount Everest grade

[Verse 3] Prevail
No stems or seeds, just sticky and fruity
Some are blonde and others ruby red headed beauties
Doobies and blunts, the pipe, the vaporizer
Twenty-five an eighth from my favorite supplier
I'm higher than Hendrix when he made Purple Haze
I'm amazed, as long as I got herb to blaze
I'm in a good mood, attitude extremely positive
It's like I'm in a dream and the greens a cause of it

[Verse 4 Madchild
It gets intense, sticks of incense
Roll that, hit that shit to get bent
Smoke and I feel like a leak through time
Thoughts creep through my mind
I peak through the blinds
Sometimes I might have a tough time breathing
Think my hearts going to stop for no reason
I just try to sit back, relax and zone out
Bring bad energy my way, get thrown out

[Chrous] Mr. Vegas
Mi seh mi feeling mellow
Under mi indica
Under mi indica
Mi indica

Seh mi feeling mellow
Under mi indica
Under mi indica
Under the indica

[Mr. Vegas]
