[Hook 1: Tre Nyce] How to contet..
Last night I left the club with a porn star
She gets around, but I like the way she go hard, yeah
Left the club with a porn star
Loves to get down, but I like the way she go hard, yeah

[Hook 2: Tre Nyce]
Left the club with a porn star, a porn star
Damn I love the way she go hard, she go hard
Left the club with a porn star, a porn star
Damn I love the way she go hard, she go hard

[Repeat Hook 1]

[Verse 1: Prevail]
You can get a pornstar, you can get a stripper
But I know the difference, one is quicker on the zipper
She likes it a little thicker, she's a nasty freak
My energizer bunny she could last for weeks
She can buy her own drinks, she can spin on them poles
She's a real professional when she hop out them clothes
She can buy her own drinks, she can spin on them poles
She's a real professional when she hop out them clothes

Shorty living vivid, me and my brothers bang
We the kings of reality, it swings when it hangs
She got an ass like cherokee, damn near bury me
I'm a good look, rap's version of Ron Jeremy

[Repeat Hook 1-2]

[Verse 2: Mad Child]
I'm a real hard rock, I'm a hip hop rock star
We on the block throwing rocks at a cop car
Getting my buzz on, drinking a Rock Star
My girl wild, yeah she party like a rock star
Party like a rock star, pound like a porn star
Lamborghini doors, 24's on my foreign car
My crew all thugs and goons, we got war scars
And everytime I leave the club I got 4 broads
Maybe more broads, cause we goes hard
Busting nuts, popping shots at a ghost car
We getting high like the great space coaster
Come on show some pride and throw your fucking west coast up

I'm a bad ass, beautiful death machine
20 grand in my pocket with a gangster lean
I'm a bad ass, beautiful death machine
20 grand in my pocket with a gangster lean

I'm at the bar like oh, oh
Hands up, let's go, go
Sipping bottles of Patron, oh
Ready to rock and roll

[Repeat Hook 1-2]
