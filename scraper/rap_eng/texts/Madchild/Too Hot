[Mad Child]
Although I -
Although I -
Although I plan to go out with a bang
Not a whimper
I still gotta watch my temper
Watch over both shoulders
Cuz of what I'm in into
Sometimes I get emotional
Cuz of what I been through
It goes - anger, anger
That's one of my hang-ups
You don't wanna rock and roll
Kid, ya head gets banged up
Feel tension
Blood starts pumping
My friends always win in their fights
I still jump in
And I don't have a drinking problem
Drink, talk shit, fall down, no problem
When I drink it's a problem
Cuz I cause problems
Heh, yo
Cold hearted and I'm so robotic
Not like you forgot
But I'm slightly psychotic
I'm here terrorize the world
Uh, the minds up for you boys and girls

[Prevail]
Complete speak
Like a cluster bomb
Cold to death
Hold ya' breath
'Til the dust is gone
From the lost angel city
To the Gotham skyline
We're still public access
But watch us go primetime
I'm cannonball crushed
Like Cain or Abel
I reign like Charlemagne
And just as fatal
I'm not vain or narcissistic
Preach like an archbishop
From the darkest district
In the killing fields
Plant seeds of descent
Fast fascinating demons
Flashing teams with contempt
Self-contained
I'm my own metropolis
Go against the grains
For the throne of the populous
Kingdoms, I want 'em
Hand 'em over, relinquish
Or I'll douse them in flames
That you'll never extinguish
My right hand writes
In sequential order
Eventually I'll make your life span
Potentially shorter

[Mad Child]
There's so much dirt
Can't rinse the filth
Why people concerned
With my mental health
Hope to go to heaven
But I been through hell
Think I'm going crazy man
Please don't tell
Cops hate me
They want to throw me in jail
Hate to think they got me alone in the cell
I'm pretty sure it wouldn't go so well
Cuz ain't nobody comin'
When you yell for help

[Prevail]
We're the fast and elite
The young and the vigorous
You should probably keep your distance
Cuz my hungry is hideous
Tell affiliates and friends
There's no need to defend
When the warriors descend
Is where the story will end
We're ageless and timeless
You're faceless and spineless
So let us lead the way
While they follow in blindness
