[Verse 1] Madchild
I’ma fight for my right, stay tight on the mic
Only house on the block shine bright late at night
See, I stay on the grind, get hyped right in sight
Yeah I work so you like when white lightning strike
Who wanna mess with the best when I stand like a man with the “S” on my chest
And my flames collect dangerous rep when they step
So the cops want to stop me at best, not impressed
Like I give a fuck
I’ma live it up
We have risen ‘cause I’m driven, never giving up
I’m a wizard in my prison and this isn’t luck
It’s like I’m livid on this rhythm and you with it, huh
A lot of rap these days, it’s so predictable
It’s not particularly terrifically difficult
Don’t like your vision and it isn’t what I listen to
I mean, we could get physical. Grim Reaper could visit you

[Hook] Madchild
Ain’t no trauma like
Ain’t no drama like, my life
Come alive, Mad not calm at night
You should watch your mouth before you mobilize
Now that I’ve come back home ‘cause that’s a homicide

Ain’t no trauma like
Ain’t no drama like, my life
Come alive, Mad not calm at night
You should watch your mouth before you mobilize
Now that I’ve come back home ‘cause that’s a homicide

[Verse 2] Prevail
My opening comments will tarnish your campaign
I vanquish with language, my Riot Squad like Bad Brains
My man Shane’s a razor blade, grade-A grenade
Arrive to the dark side of life and your train’s delayed
I’m the conductor with a hammer and an anvil
The Phantom of the Opera, dropping bodies in the landfill
Grave epitaphs engraved with the first and last names of all the victims that I’ve claimed with effervescent raps
Brighter than floodlights, young knights of valor
Never turn a blind eye to the strength of my armada
Master and commander of the battleship fleet
Admiral Prevail, your ship wrecked on Battle Axe Beach
Landmines, claymores, tripwires, trenches
Try aerial attacks and we’ll shoot out your engines
Tailspinning, g-force, lose control, nosedive
No parachutes so you and the copilot both die!

[Hook] Madchild
Ain’t no trauma like
Ain’t no drama like, my life
Come alive, Mad not calm at night
You should watch your mouth before you mobilize
Now that I’ve come back home ‘cause that’s a homicide

Ain’t no trauma like
Ain’t no drama like, my life
Come alive, Mad not calm at night
You should watch your mouth before you mobilize
Now that I’ve come back home ‘cause that’s a homicide
