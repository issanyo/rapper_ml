[Hook]

Sometimes I feel I'm inventing my stress
But I will not stop cause I really can't rest
I've been a long way but I don't know, no, just how long I'm still gonna go
And I feel no pain, no I have grown
Cause I am still me

[Verse 1: Illucid]
Sometimes it's hard for me be to find out what inspires you
You got a narrow mind you need to find a brighter view
You need to see it from the road like riders do
Thats why we pushing of, cause all of this is inspite of you
You know we do this for the ones who are down, from day one
Stuck around now they up in the crowd , the same ones
And I'm looking at the world with a different lens
Many different cities now we roll with some different friends
I guess it just depends, me I don't ever change
Just the same dude that was rapping in the seventh grade
I never went away, even when I went away
I ended up on center stage and I never put the pen away
I do it everyday I never really get to sleep
I´m always thinking music even when I finally get to sleep
Don't ever ask just what happen to the real me
Cause after all that happen it´s still me

Sometimes I feel I'm inventing my stress
But I will not stop cause I really can't rest
I've been a long way but I don't know, no, just how long I'm still gonna go
And I feel no pain, no I have grown
Cause I am still me

[Verse 2: Mad Child]
My worst enemy is me it seems there's no doubt about it
And even when I'm all alone it's like my house is crowded
Life's a fucking rollercoaster it's a long ride
And if you thought I would quit you picked the wrong guy
I got a lot on problems, most of them are mental
Ferociously which radiate from an explosive center
Five years I was nothing but a walking zombie
Now I'm back I know I'm lucky so I'm talking calmly
But you won't understand the pain just below the surface
Deep depression my reflection now to me is worthless
I feel like I have been abandoned, a stranded hero
And now I'm labled as a bandit in a land of zeroes
But I ain't trippin' fuel injecting sitting idly
Excitedly colliding with the monster that's inside of me
Madchild I'm from the league of the demented
Back to finish up what we originally intended

[Hook]
Sometimes I feel I'm inventing my stress
But I will not stop cause I really can't rest
I've been a long way but I don't know, no, just how long I'm still gonna go
And I feel no pain, no I have grown
Cause I am still me

[Verse 3: J Thorn]
Man I'll kill me, you know I still be
Doing the same things I was doing since I was brewing my first beats
And before that scribbling on my loose leafs
I'm still the same dude though I've inherited new beefs
This ain't a fad I still rap with my brother
Tell them we been writing tunes since people were wearing cross colors
But now we gotta react or they pull us under attack
Of the paranormal like we were the ghostbusters

Yeah we impress a little better when flexing ??? ??? ???
Got a little more money but not enought that could change me
Working twice as hard as ever, but guessing you wouldn't blame me
Unless you my competition and then you might wanna hang me

I let the story write itself going day to day
Cut me like a razorblade pushing it in a major vain
We on the verge of something big, but I will stay away
If it means I won't be able to be the same J
