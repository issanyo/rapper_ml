[Intro]
"His incredible vision, already a trillion times sharper than that of any ordinary being. Super beast gazes farther out into the universe than any human has ever dared or even tried to see..."

[Verse 1: MadChild]
They love me when I'm crazy, love to feel my pain
So they sit alone and know they're not the only ones insane
I'm perfect, a mentally blurred, disturbed serpent
A merging of murderous words that serve purpose
From fresh air, walking the dogs with birds chirping
To death stares, talking to god, it's not working
It's not fair, have to give it time, be patient
I'm just a spec of sand compared to all creation
From bleach blonde addict to creature of habit
Thinking in my dreams, it's time to reach out and grab it
Down to the furniture, each detail imagined
Loft in Vancouver, Venice beach house, and cabin
In the middle of the forest with a creek, that's serenity
Can't wait until the day I go to sleep with no enemies
Walk around the city knowing I could be killed
From an old beef, a sociopathic's cheap thrills
Yeah I'll make a little money with awfully steep bills
And some awful big debts, it's an awfully steep hill
But I'mma keep on climbing while I grind and I hustle
Fist clenched, white knuckles till my knees fuckin' buckle

[Hook: MadChild]
Addictive personality, destructive, give me more pain
Laughing while destroying, I'm the Joker wearing war paint
With a scorpion on my thumb
I just wanna get some head, taking opiates till I'm numb
Feeling so alone, watch this orphan come undone
To a shape shifting ape lifting weights, having fun
Acid spewing speed demon, feeding on the weak
I get paid for words, literally eat from what I speak

[Verse 2: MadChild]
They talk a lot of shit without even one try
While I'm delivering the sun till the rivers run dry
New found strength, so I might go forth
BAX WAR, that's disciples of a psycho dwarf
They say I could be bigger if I just conform
But I don't wanna be in clubs, I detest the norm
I'm a monster that's heartless, creator of darkness
Eccentric collector with a shrine for an apartment
Writing rhymes on my Noguchi coffee table, burning incenses
They say that I'm insensitive, at least I'm intense
Harboring my agony and pain, let it unleash
Then breathe fire, pounding on my chest like I'm a dumb beast
Dapper demigod, snob, I'm a label whore
Sentences is full of savagery, it's a crazy war
Going on inside my fuckin head, no rest for the wicked
Dog, I just want to kick it
But these twisted rhymes are racing
Will it? Won't stop spinning
Might be mental demented but I'm bent on winning
Clarifying that I'm verifying that I'm a terrifying scary giant
Every line I spit's an arrow flying

[Hook: MadChild]
Addictive personality, destructive, give me more pain
Laughing while destroying, I'm the Joker wearing war paint
With a scorpion on my thumb
I just wanna get some head, taking opiates till I'm numb
Feeling so alone, watch this orphan come undone
To a shape shifting ape lifting weights, having fun
Acid spewing speed demon, feeding on the weak
I get paid for words, literally eat from what I speak

[Outro]
"It was a mile long thrill ride through total darkness."
"Some thrill."
"Certain people said it was mind expanding. In fact it was mind shattering."
