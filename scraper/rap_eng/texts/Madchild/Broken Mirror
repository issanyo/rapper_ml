[Intro]
Look at yourself and write down the truth. What more fatal complex subject could you find? It’s hard to face. Or maybe you’re afraid of yourself

[Verse 1]
[Madchild]
Daylight fright. They might bite
I get so high. I’m high as a kite
Fly to new heights. I try to do right
Grow older, weight of the world’s on my shoulders
People are bad, pretend to be helpless
Mad give juice to the youth. I’m selfish
I try to explore the dark side of the road
Skeleton’s dangling. Star-spangled mangling
I’m all tangled up in two gangs I’m fucked
Devour smurf. It’s all our turf
Let’s kick through the fence and waste a few heads
But karma’s a bitch that you’ll face when you’re dead
Sweet demon, take me to a level that’s a true test
Devil in a blue dress, I’ll do what I do best
Control freak speak. Do as I say
When you and I play cause you are not safe

[Hook]

Here I go again, here I go again
[X4]

[Verse 2]
The mind suffers. Thoughts are all scattered
With delicate matters and elegant patterns
A trail of myself. I’m beyond redemption
Weak to temptation, I’m filled with tension
Attract acts of vengeance. I will go the length
Cause I rap with my grandfather’s strength
I will not lose my family
Miracle man, you can’t stand me
I push for my dreams. Only God can command me
Black hand dark prints of the city
It’s hideous language. Bad blood on canvas
No partners we will keep building
I swear on the lives of my unborn children
That I would burn in Hell just to keep you safe
But I will stimulate my growth while I keep my faith
Give you everything inside my skull
These are the memoirs of a troubled soul

[Hook]
