[Madchild]
People ain't catching up
Cause' I'm ahead of my time
Only way that I could lose
Is me  forgetting my lines
Ain't nobody fucking with this monster
I'm a word serpent
Make you happy
Like a sunny day
With birds chirping
One of the greatest fucking rappers, that is for certain
Cause' I'm a lunatic, a wizard with this word blurtin
I'm sharper than a blade, there'll be blood squirtin'
A red shirt, you're in the dirt cause' I'm above perfect
DZK, Madchild with QBert
Pick a fucking rapper then i'll flick him like a booger
I'm shooting off of the mouth like I'm a "jon a. luger" or "drawn out Luger"
A fucking nazi I'm a monster call me freddy kreuger
And Jason Vorhees open up the door please
Open up from both us to morph right into warp speed
And ain't nobody sayin fuck me, you're a toy
I'm a toy hustler, huck g

[DZK]
It goes a little something like pass me the fucking mic
Dive into the cypher with a jack knife
Gunjack from Tekken mechanic arm propellars
Spin elephant man cannibal vomit volanic skeletons
Still grill, gorilla built the ill villian trill sin of whiskey
Swilling in chin-chillas AAHGH
DZK, I stuck my sen-sai young gunna
I never give a fuck what him-say
Sub-terreanian extra-terrestrial alien
Breathe like aquatic ?"mamalian"?
Sea-born breathe like I heathe fucking C4
Crawling the sea-shore VA to B-Mor
Watchin cops as they "chalk" your men
Stalking rooftops mocking, I'm talkin shit
Tossin rocks, i'm off my meds
I keep a pet talking head
I got off the walking dead

[Madchild]
I'm extra graphic when it comes
To bloody psychic matter, spitting acid
Turn your body into anti-matter
I've been a bastard since
I've was a little ankle biter
Broke out of my incubator and popped a couple tranquilizers
Wore my blanket as a superman cape
And now I'm a damn dirty ape, with a black .38
And I rap dirty, wait, I'm a half turtle, half rabbit
Black magic crackhead with cracked vertabraes
I was dope since I worked at the bomb shop
Moulding super verses since the fucking ".com" drop
I'll be next in charge, I've been dope since I was working back at extra large
15 years, no sexy cars, Double XL cover, no texting stars
I'm still an at it going extra hard, Mad spitting out coke like Escobar
