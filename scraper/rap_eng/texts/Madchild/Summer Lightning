[Verse 1] Prevail
In the wars of attrition, we ride upon the spine of the griffin
Destroying small rodents and insects like victims
Paradise lost to the flames of the Fahrenheit
Mr. Brady told me watch the explosion and compare the light
So I did and saw the moments of the life I’ve lived
Now I’m amped, I push the storyteller from the lamp
Who dare to bask in spotlights stands with my name
I stampede the rookies while they search for the reigns
My who’s cave-in chest, Ingest this suggestion
Move or get moved by the powers of collection
We are three who are connected by direction
Upward is the motion, forward is perfection
Simplistic, only if the lines in between are the hardest ones to read and you couldn’t hear the schemes
Bad Dreams, you’ll soon know the completion
Battle Axe Warrior, Prevail One to form the legion

[Verse 2] Mr. Brady
Aye
I’m dangerous, highly explosive
Closer than multiple burn marks, riddle your dry skin
Breath control, never swing no battle axe dull
Sharp harpoons, chlorine in your eyes like a pool
You couldn’t burn a track, self-combustion in a weed patch, vegetable
Feel me like giant squid tentacles
I’m a brain twister filling a propeller
Putting gas fumes in place of your asthma inhalers
Head-butt you with spiked headbands
Sipping on spiced rums out of gas cans
Projects all up and riddling in my project
Our community false speaking in hidden dialect
I speak to less fortunate stragglers, desolate
Prev and Madchild, Brady, we ain’t having it
It’s perfection up in my extravagance
Meet the last bit of your palms lifeline
I waited a lifetime for my time to shine

[Scratches]

[Hook]
We don’t sit around and wait, we take what’s given
Brady, Battle Axe, hip-hop is what we living
We don’t sit around and wait, we take what’s given
Brady, Battle Axe, hip-hop is what we living

Aye, is what we living
We don’t sit around and wait, we take what’s given

Of what we living
Brady, Battle Axe, hip-hop is what we living

[Verse 3] Madchild
Crank the heat amongst fangs that puncture flesh
I welcome any challengers, out comes another youngsters death
Tongues tied twisted in knots, my plot’s to kill
New kids coming up? That means there’s lots more blood to spill
When I flood the market, you don’t want to be my target
Unharnessing carnage, I’ll turn a man into a carcass
The darkness of the deeply disturbed and deranged, that’s right
You think I’m crazy now? Should have seen me in my past life
Flashlights can find the remains of people that rubbed me the wrong way
Yo, for real, don’t fuck around. I’ve had a long day
Let’s not forget who’s rapping while you listen to this song play
Not an illusion, king of skull crushing confusion
That buries axes and skulls then relaxes in pools of blood
Son of Sam, I’m walking up to cars and shooting fools in love
Living in a nightmare, can’t quite pinpoint what my dream is
I’m limitless ‘cause I’ll snap in a minute, I’m an extremist
My whole team’s untypical, it’s difficult to match this
You’ll probably have to rewind this a couple times before you catch this

[Hook]
We don’t sit around and wait, we take what’s given
Brady, Battle Axe, hip-hop is what we living
We don’t sit around and wait, we take what’s given
Brady, Battle Axe, hip-hop is what we living

Aye, is what we living
We don’t sit around and wait, we take what’s given

Hip-hop
Brady, Battle Axe, hip-hop is what we living
