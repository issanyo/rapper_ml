(Here's the best one)

[Hook]
My poetry is deep, I never fail
I keep falling, never fall to six feet deep

[Verse 1: Madchild]
They feed us hope just to poison our souls
Tried to get ahead but now your boy is in a hole
Madchild: the track savage
Inhale darkness and exhale Black Magic
So fuck it, I'm back at it
Shit, might as well take another crack at it
I'm the magic man; abracadabra
Vocabulary like volcanic lava
Far from fabulous, still playing Galaga
Next generation, still bewitched like Tabitha
Still a phenomenon, I'm the commandant
Still got shit on deck up on the promenade
Lookin' down, colorful botanical garden
Robotic Jabberjaw, spit mechanical jargon
A million other rappers fill the planet with garbage
So I have to represent cause Mad is Canada's hardest
Sharper than a razor's edge
Lyrics, they could raise the dead
Crazy like Eraserhead
Rap's actually baffling
High above these other acts, up on my scaffolding
I'm a cowboy, natural but track wacko
Said "Howdy partner" then I spat black tobacco

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Madchild]
Great white hope that likes dope
Recite quotes with broke white folks that like smokes
Is this not what you came for?
To see Shane's pain pour like rain down a drain storm
On my knees like I paint floors
Split personality like Batman and Bane's war
Yosemite Sam with two hand cannons
Standing on the Grand Canyon listening to Santana
I'm lookin' down from the ledge
Thinkin' I might of lost my edge
But still got voices in my head
Represent the demented, my freak flag flies
Ends meet: my incentive, but weeks drag by
Swing my sword like Spartacus
My look is nautical, black toque and a cardigan
My parameter: exceed the grasp of mere mortals
Look at life through a kaleidoscope and it appears normal
Still wounded from failure
Doom lisp, my career blooms like azaleas
Pretend I like to be alone
No visitors, ain't no one call me on the phone
Feelin' like I need to be cleansed, I need some new friends
Cause I ain't got a girl, even in this new Benz
Opposite of superstar
Still a bit popular on Twitter, that's where the groupies are

[Hook]
