[Verse 1] Prevail
Amplified, fortified, more to my liking
Come alive, overdrive, certified writing
Simplified, mortified, purified rhyming
Horrified, glorified war, Rob the Viking
We’re hungry, we’re thirsty and we’re coming in
I’m eating and drinking and these are my friends
Hand over fist, damn don’t resist
My fang gang’ll bang and manhandle this
If we have to twist or bench, snap or break
Your neck, back and spine for work out the weight
We will for real, we’re still the type
With death appeal to kill the mic
You know what I feel like? Taking no prisoners
Coming out blasting, laughing like The Riddler
This one will get in ya, S&M signature
Y’all too miniature, can’t wait to finish ya

[Hook] Moka Only
The weight of the world
(For real, y'all)
And you don’t wanna push me to the edge
(We get ya)
Prepare for the worst
(We see ya)
‘Cause you are now rocking with the best
(We hit ya)

The weight of the world
(For real, y'all)
And you don’t wanna push me to the edge
(We get ya)
Prepare for the worst
(We see ya)
‘Cause you are now rocking with the best
(We hit ya)

[Verse 2] Prevail
You don’t want to know what kind of place we’ve been living in
You turn around, a persons face change like chameleon
We strike like a million, we’re money in the bank
It’s golden and Swollen and rollin’ like a tank
Battleaxe Warriors take your positions
Y’all too scrawny for the weight we’ve been lifting
You should let us take over and crush
And watch how the crowd just feed off the rush

[Verse 3] Madchild
Such an untouchable, you following?
Rottweiler with the high alcohol tolerance
Killers, gorillas in the mist with this
Mister mischievous, it's ridiculous to think who is suicidal enough to look after ya after a masterful massacre has occurred
Naturally a disastrous catastrophe
Now tell me who the fuck want to rap after me

[Hook] Moka Only
The weight of the world
(For real, y'all)
And you don’t wanna push me to the edge
(We get ya)
Prepare for the worst
(We see ya)
‘Cause you are now rocking with the best
(We hit ya)

The weight of the world
(For real, y'all)
And you don’t wanna push me to the edge
(We get ya)
Prepare for the worst
(We see ya)
‘Cause you are now rocking with the best
(We hit ya)


[Verse 3] Madchild
I’m relying on, friends with firearms
White lightning, trans am iron-on
Kid, I’m incredible hulking it
Can’t touch this mic, clutch with Vulcan grip
There’s no alternate, we’re the ultimate
Keep wounds open, Prev throw salt in it
Spitting icicles and so forth
Go for it, I’ll blowtorch your snow fort
There’s no avoiding us, we’re poisonous
Get into this psychological influence
Infamous, plus ferocious
Do not approach us you cock-a-roaches
Armed heavily, this is longevity
Can’t keep up to myself, I’m way ahead of me
Madchild’s a ball of confusion losing y’all
I’m delusional plus unusual

[Moka Only]
Heavy world, stress is real
I’ll tell you how pressure feels
Spinal snaps, shoulders crack
But we keep pushing, won’t fall back
