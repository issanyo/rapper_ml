Chewing Concrete
Chewing Concrete

[Verse 1] Prevail
Dancing with the dunes, watch your step
One slip, my teeth rip through your neck
All flesh, always been fresh, always will be
Shadows in the hallway begging “come with me”
Dizzy, tipsy, wine and gypsies, mine lives knives
Midwives, stingrays and pixies
Risky business, my life on a discus
Witness protection, two in the attested
Geometric ethics rocks you out
Keep it, keep it in the circle off the head, out the mouth
You don’t want a dog bite, bites and scars
Slice and carve nice and large, you won’t like the odds
Heard it before, murder the floor
Burn the roof, kill the show down, I shock it loose
If you down with the cock then respect the roost
And roosters respect the hens
Wolves in pigpens, foxes in chicken dens
Animal appetite, cannonball crush candlelight
Madam Black, Mistress White
Sabre tooth fright night, I can’t stand the light

What you doing?

[Prevail]
Concrete Chewing, on a track with Murge and all you suckers are ruined
What you doing?

[Madchild]
Chewing Concrete, S&M attack again and you’ll be gone in a heartbeat

[Verse 2] Madchild
Battleaxe phantom, bad temper tantrum
Serpent with turpentine and canteen
Watching cartoon on acid, flashback classic
Twist masochist, risks if asking
Won’t hesitate to smack bitch if that’s what witch want
I strangle, otherwise treat girl like angel
Madchild, love it when a plan come together
Kevlar vest on my chest like whatever
Words fit together like drugs and fiends
Full flipping a machine gun in submarines
Letting off rounds, never soft sounds with my crew
Group that excite you, do what I like to
Blunt to the head, jack to the brain
Name, Shane. Never use the lord’s name in vain
Tyrannosaurus rex when it come to sex
Play safe, always where a condom, son
‘Cause I don’t want to have my shit blown to kingdom come
And if the people want the pain, I’ma bring them some

[Verse 3]

[Prevail]
Feast and famine, rain and drought
Eat well, sleep well, my voice don’t burn out
Asphalt, concrete, brick, stone and rock
Eat ‘em all, chew ‘em up, spit ‘em out in blocks
Knock ‘em out the box, break the bats in half
Seek the whole World Series? Keep your team in last

[Madchild]
Not blast from the past, don’t flash cash
Used to get my kicks breaking bricks of hash
Used to slut boxes to tap that ass
Used to get excited, kid, now I don’t rap that fast
Bazooka Joe rapper, ask my folks
Bubblegum rhymes plus you come with jokes
