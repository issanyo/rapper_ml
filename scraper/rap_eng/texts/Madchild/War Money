It's Dagger Mouth
Get your playing cards
Play some canasta

[Verse 1]

Yo-
I got poison in my blood, poison in my veins
Poison in my heart, poison in my brain
Every love I had was poisonous so I’ll say it again
I am insane, Mad Child, poison in my name
My friends are fucking crazy cause my boys all feel the same
But I’m older feeling lazy cause the poison still remains
I guess I have to face the facts that I will never feel the same
But let the pit bull off the chain and see if I could kill again
I’m a blue-nosed, green-eyed, thoroughbred pure breed
Double threat, split personality, you’re fucking dead
I’m still in black like Darth Vader
I’ll drape you up like Al-Qaeda
I’m still shifty, fuck with me, buck fifty
To your face with the sharp razor
Slice like a light saber, bright like a Lifesaver
Hi haters, play pussy, get fucked like a vibrator
Yeah Indiana Jones, I’m the mic raider
Arc raider, back to Darth Vader
I’m a Hannibal, a cannibal, I killed em then I sauteed em
I ain’t afraid of nobody bitch, everybody bleed
Everybody die, everybody cry
Everybody lie, everybody ask why
All my buddies get muddy, everybody get high

[Hook]

War Cry, eye for an eye
Lex Talionis
Laws of the Land, Battleaxe Warriors
War Dance, Hand for a Hand
King Hammurabi
Laws of the Land, Tattoos, Swollen Army
Now war money, more money, your money’s our money
Stand in our way, we don’t play, now you’re bloody

[Verse 2]

Yo I swam through rivers of blood and seen hellfire
Won’t lie, when I did percs I never felt higher
Hard rocker, ex pill popper
Jaw-dropper, I’m a pretty boy hustler
Rough around the edges, still a savage on the warpath
Ravenous, hazardous, drafting up a floor plan
Five years were terrible, errors from heroin
Seroquel, now it’s time for five years of miracles
Arrogance, time to save myself from embarrassment
No procrastinating for this nasty North American
I used to be a dreamboat, steamboat, colourful hero
Robert De Niro, fly, now my teeth are slowly rotting
And there’s people out there plotting
That pretend to be my friends and wanna see me die
I don’t fucking care though, scared like I’m a scarecrow
Come on I got something for that ass bro
I’m still an asshole, no cash flow
I killed the rumours that I’m running out of gas, no

[Verse 3]

My back piece, black ink by Akra war chiefs
Speech pale horse, Palomino, bow and arrow flow
Colt 45 barrel do that black .23
Rules of engagement rearranging physicality
Sleepy Hollow hollow men, dance of invisibility
Panther claw, jaguar paw adds to credibility
Hundred proof the vocal booth, a moonshine distillery
Jack you like Daniels, hourglass sand granules
Hand-to-hand combat, man killed by animal
Strike match flammable like sulphuric chemical

[Hook]

War Cry, eye for an eye
Lex Talionis
Laws of the Land, Battleaxe Warriors
War Dance, Hand for a Hand
King Hammurabi
Laws of the Land, Tattoos, Swollen Army
Now war money, more money, your money’s our money
Stand in our way, we don’t play, now you’re bloody

[Verse 4]

Stomp like Godzilla, killer no filler
I’m Jerry Lee Lewis yeah great balls of fire
Goodness gracious, eight bars of fire
I reached for the star, almost lost my desire
Then Mad turned from Anakin into Darth Vader
Rebuilt the Death Star so we could strike back like empire
Deep bite, vampire, new moon shit
Bring it on, I break dawn like a full moon eclipse

[Outro]

Yeah war money, more money, your money’s our money
Stand in our way, we don’t play, now you’re bloody

War money, more money, your money’s our money
Stand in our way, we don’t play, now you’re bloody
