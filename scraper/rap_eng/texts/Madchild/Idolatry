[Hook (scratched)]
Yo, I'm your idol
I'm.. your idol
Yo, I'm your idol
Your highest idol, numero uno
Yo, I'm your idol
I'm.. your idol
Yo, I'm your idol
Your highest idol, numero uno

[Verse 1: Black Pegasus]
Look at me but hold your camera tight, this ain't candle light
I'm a supernova and these cats ain't even satellites
Been flipping words before Vanna white was Vanna white
So don't say Jack like Pat when I handle mics
This wheel of fortune; no, this wheels of fortune
When I die, I'm gonna leave my kids a million Porches
Got gas money that could fill up tanks
Will Smith I let fresh prints fill up banks (Uncle Phil!)
I'm not a ghost, this isn't Halloween
When I get inside your girl's walls and make the bitch scream (hehe)
You want beef? Well, we can battle for bucks
They know I hold the highest title like the cannabis cup (hello!)
Seein' all these sellouts makes me feel scorned
But their career short lived like a stillborn
You can't be free attached to a ball and chain
'Cause nowadays everybody wanna ball and chain
So I went back in my hood like car parts
And became great overall like Carl Hearts
He, and I don't care who wants to follow me
And fuck social media, that shit's idolatry

[Hook]
Yo, I'm your idol
I'm.. your idol
Yo, I'm your idol
Your highest idol, numero uno
Yo, I'm your idol
I'm.. your idol
Yo, I'm your idol
Your highest idol, numero uno

[Verse 2: Mr Biscuit]
I'm passive-aggressive, so much that when P gets distracted suggestion
I said guess 'cause I'm down for no reason like manic depressives
My people parish, so I bared the Atlantic with weapons, to bring family back to this crowds like the Spanish oppression (Let's go)
Look, when I meet against you, you need to gents you
When I bring this pencil, rappers want less beef than the bulimic hindu (Holy cow)
To keep it simple, I'm so encrypted with strategic missiles
You wouldn't have a leg up but stripes if a zebra kicked you
You can leave this to a dude like me to be on this duty
They vegan, so when I say something meaty, they call it moody
You think I won't slap bucks of layman, claimin' he makin' bread
In preschool I wouldn't take mouth off of a Mr. Potato Head
Moving y'all dimension is rude and you not to mention
I got sixteens barred like a juvenile detention, if ah..
So I the dude like a Dog Snoop around the kitchen
In a Cadillac drive like a coop without an engine, get it?

[Hook]
Yo, I'm your idol
I'm.. your idol
Yo, I'm your idol
Your highest idol, numero uno
Yo, I'm your idol
I'm.. your idol
Yo, I'm your idol
Your highest idol, numero uno

[Verse 3: Madchild]
If I ain't grindin' and workin' all the time, I'm bored as hell
Back knotted up so bad, feel like a tortoise shell
Weight of the world on my shoulders and on my back
Wheels are spinnin' in my head, burnin' rubber on this track
Your dead marks, I leave tread marks, you wouldn't dare it (No)
Formula one, James Hunt in the McLaren
Suicidal tendencies, do-or-die dependencies
Show attendances are going up, you're not offending me (Hahaha)
Suicidal killin' machine, verses villainous
The thrill of it with militancy, I am brilliant, I'm really in the lane of my own
Come from a place where people there don't talk on the phone
We don't dry snakes, bitch.. their means are for fairies
Underground king, Colorado to the prairies
Feeling jacket, a rare level and daredevils
Attack a beat like on bears wrestle a clear message

[Hook]
Yo, I'm your idol
I'm.. your idol
Yo, I'm your idol
Your highest idol, numero uno
Yo, I'm your idol
I'm.. your idol
Yo, I'm your idol
Your highest idol, numero uno
