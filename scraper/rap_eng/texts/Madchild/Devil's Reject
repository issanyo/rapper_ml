[Verse 1: Madchild]

I'm hiding in the shadow from the demons that I battle
I'm a psycho with a hypodermic needle in my ankle
My cerebral has a fire breathing ego that exists
I'm evil, people lock my sights and burn you to a crisp
My sentiments are venomous, I'm poisonous to enemies
No cure, there is no remedy -- death will be the penalty
I'm menacing, inventive with demented thoughts of grandeur
Temper is explosive, I'm a boiling pot of anger
Middle-aged mutant, deformed monstrosity
Do not have the audacity to fuck with this atrocity
Reform, deform, creeper in a tree fort
Deport, back into my country, read the report
Igor.. "why dey wanna pick on little me for?"
C4 explosives, I'm ferocious by the seashore
Keep it, you will reap it, I will give it all I got
I'm strategic, devil's reject, I will think then I will plot (Blah!)

[Verse 2: Madchild]

I will have the last laugh, I'm a fuckin' bad man
Surround my house with sand bags, like in fuckin' Bahgdad
They don't feel the fire yet? They will feel the back draft
Hand makin' bullets when I'm listenin' to Black Flags
Selectors, they are sodomized, detecting me on satellite
Sneak across the border to Seattle with a pad and mic
DJ play a battle break, I'm battling on stage
I'm a rattle snake, you kids should not be rattling my cage
And I don't give a fuck about a rapper with a buzz
I'll happily attack him and extract a little blood
Like packing an exacto, I'm exact with the result
Your friends can ask what happen, you'll say "Crap, it was my fault.."
I'm an albatross, fuckin' falcon claws
Half mountain lion, countless crimes but I'll be fine
My blood is mixed with alkaline
Kill the little monster, he is obviously insane
He's probably just a goblin that has problems with his brain

[Verse 3: Madchild]

I go to bed at night, I'm dreaming of revenge
But I'm tossing and I'm turning, candle burning at both ends
I wake up asking "Don't you hear the laughing?"
They don't hear it
Every night I pray to God, "Protect us from these evil spirits."
Lyrics like I'm touched by the angels; I'm dangerous
Put my words together in the strangest arrangements
I'm blooming from my vanity; illuminate insanity
Accumulating doom related lines that leave you panicking
A samurai; I guess I glamorize being traumatized
Promise I will never compromise with these homicides
An alligator salivating, calibrating jaws
Rap of malady I'll gravitate to gladiator dogs
Divine separatist, rhyme defined specimen
Combine efforts, align sublime specialist
I design, refine lines is my weaponry
Trying to find destiny, God provides recipe
