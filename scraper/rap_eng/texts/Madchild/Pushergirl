[Intro: MadChild]
It’s funny these bad bitches
They a bunch of f*cking liars
And they acting like they p*ssy is crack though
Problem is half the time the shit’s the bomb

[Chorus: Mike Smith]
Pushergirl I’m so high on those lies you keep feeding me
Pushergirl never did like the way you been treating me

[Verse 1: MadChild]
Behind closed doors, we doing shit that ain’t appropriate
Fucking you without a condom like we trying to procreate
Body cracking, backing up and snapping like a scorpion
Cause I’m addicted to that p*ssy like it’s opium
Vocally I’m saying she is more than okie dokie folks
Turn around, we’ll do the hokey pokey, like we’re smoking dope
I keep coming back for more, though I know you’re a lion
Doesn’t matter, tits are perfect plus her pussy fucking fire
Actually it’s ecstasy, you’re my little sexy bitch
Even once a month, always come back for an extra hit
I’m crushing on you like I’m crushing up some morphine
Like a kid that’s just had his dessert and is saying more please
You are like a drug, I need to try and quit
Cause I’ve been thinking bout you all the time and you’re a lying bitch
The way that ass is popping out them black jeans
Faster than an athlete, I keep coming back like I’m  a crackfiend

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Nino Bless]
One day she’s ride or die, the next she’s tired of your lies
I idolize your outside till I died up inside
My highest fear you ain’t by my side, come here yeah
Lets ride through higher and high enough to hire [?]
I am here with floating, zoning
All that cloud of smoke roaming to the center of an opening
Got you opening, groping and now you soaking up
Smoke some bud and while you reaching you gon’ know what’s up
You know it and I know the thoughts and all the costs
Starts to shift, post stars and probes and Mars to glitch
You were probably when I saw the aura I’m out with you
Even one of your odds, we look really Minaj
Balling, Taj Mahal with molly and bump the volume
She getting annoying and the volume ain’t even high at all
Nah, she’s just my fix, I detox
I recommit then relapse then readmit she’s my pushergirl

[Chorus: Mike Smith]
Pushergirl I’m so high on those lies you keep feeding me
Pushergirl never did like the way you been treating me
Pushergirl I’m so high on those lies you keep feeding me
