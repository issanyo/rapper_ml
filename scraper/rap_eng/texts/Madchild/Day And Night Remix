[Verse 1]
Day and night, I pray to God I’m not losing my mind
Look in the mirror, I know something’s wrong
Cause my reflection is not quite the same (same)
Now look at me, Madchild I’m not the man I used to be
See I had things popping off in the past
Then I started taking pills that kick my ass (ass)

[Hook 1]
Now he ain’t right, the lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
There’s people all around but he don’t mind
He’s got no boner when watching porno at night (a-a-at night)
Day and night, the lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He’s all alone inside this crowded house
He’s on the couch popping pills till he’s passing out

[Verse 2]
Hey yo I got this crazy habit, this pill I gotta have it
Thank God I got my family, walls closing in around me
I’m trapped, can’t get around it, it get my heart start pounding
Sometimes I just can’t stand it, yup till I re-up I panic
I got to got to get it, this shit is so pathetic
My neck and back is sweating, damn, can’t feel this bad already
Get the word, hands are steady, make the place to meet I’m ready
But I don’t want to look too anxious
Don’t want to have to meet these gangsters
They about as tough as hamsters but they packing, I’ll take my chances
Everything turned out okay, got my pills, I’m on my way
Now I’m ready for the day, I hate having to live this way

[Hook 2]
Pain is deep, I’m self-destructing and my fear is me
My girl’s still hanging but just by a thread
She’s scared that she’ll wake up and I’ll be dead
Cause things ain’t right, the lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He’s watching movies till the morning light
He’s popping pills until he’s higher than a kite

[Outro]
Higher than a kite man
That's the way i've been for
The last three and a half years
It's costing me like 4 or 5 hundred dollars a day
To get high everyday. Do the math motherfuckers
I spent a half mil on fuckin' stupid shit
Getting fucking stoned
Spent a half mil on getting high
Don't even get high no more
I just get by. I paid 5 hundred dollars a day
So i'm not sittin'. Fucking retarded trap i'm in man
It's time for things to change. It's time for me to really change
I really wanna fuckin change. I'll see you on celebrity rehab
