[Intro] Madchild

Yeah
This isn't just about friendship
This is family right here
And that's a bond that can't be broken
You know what I'm saying

[Verse 1] Madchild

How do I feel about my band of brothers
Friends for life we understand each other
May be the best thing that happened to me
Swollen Members
When we met, started rappin' with P
I remember when you got your very first tattoo
Now we're both covered
Through the highs and lows
We made the most of it
But now I know your true colors
I feel like God just blessed me
With two new brothers
Cause' I look to the cross
And I ask for proof of it
To the father, to the son
Holy spirit and the mother
I pray
And feel my pain wash away
Me and Prev we could walk
We could talk all day
And Rob is like my little cousin
I could scream at the top of my lungs
But they know I still love 'em
Hold me down
Lets go, one more round
You ready
This is the big one
One more round

[Hook x2] Prevail

Got your back
Through the thick and thin
We came up still brothers till the very end
Hold me down
Always felt like music saved our life
Kept it real through the drama
We still brothers now

[Verse 2] Prevail

Who'd a thought
When we met up at extra large
Would have meant
We'd be next in charge
We were four then three
Then four now three
Now we stand together like a family undivided
Provide support
We live and die for it
It's the most important thing in my life
Mad, I remember when you battled to get into RSC
The first Swollen Members logo screened on the TV
A tour in Europe
Almost broke up in France
Our conversation, one more chance
Made Bad Dreams
Made Rob official
Brotherly love absolutely unconditional

[Hook x2] Prevail

Got your back
Through the thick and thin
We came up still brothers till the very end
Hold me down
Always felt like music saved our life
Kept it real through the drama
We still brothers now

[Verse 3] Prevail

We've done forty-five drives
Forty-five hour flights
Forty-five days a week
Forty-five minutes a night
Add another forty-five for encore
Hard core stage show
We don't lay low
Or run gun run
We take it as it comes
But whatever happens
We're going to make it as one
To my family
Thank you for everything you've given me
You had my back when no one else believed in me
Yo, how many hours have we spent
Exploring different cities
This I'll never forget
We're about to face our biggest challenge
One for all, all for one
All of this came from balance

[Hook x1] Prevail

Got your back
Through the thick and thin
We came up still brothers till the very end
Hold me down
Always felt like music saved our life
Kept it real through the drama
We still brothers now

[Verse 4] Madchild

Provide for my family
Ride with my family
Things tough, still by my side
That's family
Had a rough landing
No one's hurt badly
I'm difficult at times
But my friends understand me
I act crazy
But they act the same
Pulled me back from the flames
Gave me back my name
My brothers can't thank you enough for the love
Open my eyes, lets rise back above
And this time we will do it right
Cause' we learn from mistake
Never fake, keep our eyes out for snakes
Listen to your heart
We could make true art
Never let greed blind me again
Lets start

[Hook x2] Prevail

Got your back
Through the thick and thin
We came up still brothers till the very end
Hold me down
Always felt like music saved our life
Kept it real through the drama
We still brothers now
