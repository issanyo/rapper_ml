[Verse 1]
My name is madchild I’m a maniacal dwarf
People tell you that I’m great that’s a reliable source
I’m still an angry tyrant breathing fire of course
But I’m the greatest rapper in the entire north
Come on tell me who is better than me... MADCHILD
I said tell me who is better than me MADCHILD
I’m the greatest fuckin firebreathing dragon alive
In a blood red Ferrari like I’m magnum p.i
Anybody disagree getting socked in the eye
My tongues a fully loaded weapon once I cock it you die
And I am back to go to war like its apocalypse now
Eat a rapper like a bowl of beef and broccoli pal
Like do it awkwardly on top so they are toppling down
And I don’t care if I’m vanilla and they’re chocolate brown
I ain't never getting rich I’m the scum of the earth
I’ll be white trash for life I was bummy at birth
And I don’t know the fuckin difference between sluts and girls
Comin out my mommies tummy yelling fuck the world!
We are battleaxe warriors were comin for blood
I’ll be a rapper all my life cuz it’s just something I love
It goes...

[Hook]
Demons omens codes and monks
Baptisim under fire from a golden trunk
We are ogres and trolls were a lonely bunch
I make music for the kids getting stoned at lunch
You are not up to my standards
There can only be one like highlander
They are not in my league they’re bystanders
They are not in my league they’re bystanders

[Verse 2]
I’m a pimp on the mic like my bitch is live
Won’t stop till my kitchen is Christian Clive
I’m from the baxwar that’s a vicious tribe
Check my mission rendition I’m Mister Hyde
Little monster, I rap with a vicious vibe
I’m malicious and gifted like Christmas time
You are not up to my standards they can only be one like highlander
Just need a couple hundred thousand but it’s not gonna last
Cuz every time you sign a deal your getting raped in the ass
I ain't got a fuckin choice record company contract
Suicidal bomber jumpin out of a tom cat
Every fuckin day of my life is like combat
Fightin deep depression with aggression you don’t want that
Kamikaze suicidal ruined idol, alien
Next door they treat me like a Swedish or Australian
Shit what the fuck it’s an invisible line
Got a problem with these villains fuckin miserable mind
Ain't nobody rap like me my shits incredible
Need medical attention I’m so sick it’s unforgettable
Choppin through these beats and punting rappers like they’re edible
A cannibal better fuckin put me on a pedestal
I’m a super beast and I’m not holding back
All my thoughts gold and black with a knot folded back
It goes...

[Hook]
Demons omens codes and monks
Baptism under fire from a golden trunk
We are ogres and trolls were a lonely bunch
I make music for the kids getting stoned at lunch
You are not up to my standards
There can only be one like highlander
They are not in my league they’re bystanders
They are not in my league they’re bystanders
