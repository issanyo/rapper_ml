[Intro: Ceekay Jones]
Alone I'm standing here
Hand on the trigger, I'm pullin' it quick
And starin' at his figure, one shot, it's done

[Hook] Ceekay Jones:
I killed a man. Swore he looked just like me
Put the gun in my hand, Pulled that trigger One, Two, Three
The look in his eye. Burned into mine
When I look at myself, I see him Everytime

[Verse 1] Madchild:
Yo
I had it all and made mistakes and seen a fortune blown
Now i'm sittin' in a corner with a tortured soul
But I got up and wiped my self off and kept working
But I got demons from my past, they just keep lurking
Looked in the mirror told myself that it's the last chance
No more dancing with the devil it's the last dance
But you and I know only one of us can keep breathing
It's either me or you cause both of us are not leaving

[Hook] Ceekay Jones:
I killed a man. Swore he looked just like me
Put the gun in my hand, Pulled that trigger One, Two, Three
The look in his eye. Burned into mine
When I look at myself, I see him Everytime

[Verse 2] Madchild:
Eh
I'm sick of your excuses and I'm tired of being lied to
And no one understands the pain you went through
More than I do
I can see the anger in your eyes, you want to wear the crown
But everytime I built something back up
You want to tear it down
Self destructive patterns and addictive personality
You think that we can coexist but that just a'int reality
Smokin' barrel in my hand. Giving life another try
For me to win, I had to kill the monster on the other side

[Hook] Ceekay Jones (x2)
