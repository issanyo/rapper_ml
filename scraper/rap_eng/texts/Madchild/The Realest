Slaine: Let me tell you something man;

Yeah I started as a artist with the largest pair a balls
Barely harnessed by my drawers starving to stop world wars
I seen all the shit blacked out a whole world tour
Menaged out in Moscow passed out on a girls floor

They said the world's yours George..
So I aquired high drugs and third world whores
Out in Cambodia   nothing that I owe to ya
Slow your roll cracker sort of think of what i told to ya

This ain't my first rodeo I've been over this
Over and over pimp the game is full of biters and dobermen
Fighters with loaded guns police got all the prints
Beating all the odds still at odds with my audience

Speaking to a god like I'm large and tall as him
High tolerance drinking five dollar gin
I'm not apologen (slang or purposeful bad grammar for apologizing)
For my rotten role modellin
Pop a whole gold bottle in the room I spent tomorrow in

Load the heroin in the needle shoot the horror in
Take a shot of ------ in my sin dont try to follow him
I got a shot gun in my reaches preposterous speech
Currently tracking all my posthumous releases

CHORUS (MERK):

We the Realest, You disagree with us and you dead
Cause We the Realest, We show up when you tucked the the bed
Yeah We the Realest, You'll wake up with a gun to your head
And then you feel it, Your whole house covered in red x2

NVS: Nvvvssssss

In my thoughts,  I'm dancing with phantoms
My hearts an atom bomb, ready to go off like a tantrum
A classical assault aimed at the upper echelon
Yeah we get it done, Lightning bolts on the cuts

Hit the ashphalt thunderous spilling dinosaur guts
Its a wonderous sickness, with a villainous touch
This love for Hip Hop, gets us through the darkness
We were in the cockpit going kamikazee nuts

Long Before a profit ever hit our pockets once
We were astronauts close enough to touch the sun
Flying on wax wings, Living on the edge
Amidst giants and kings, liars and fiends

Unholy alliances just to get a little peace
But haters never cease, Is it any wonder
That my speech is a murder scene
For the critically deceased.... Rest in peace!

CHORUS

Madchild: Madchild!

Relics leave your skeletal remains
Take a telescope to pain, I am hella dope again

I got bottled up aggression and I can't breathe
My blood is boiling thoughts uncoiling

I'm a damn chief, and we no play play
Cause we are workaholics  I'm diabolical

They're worthless and my circle's flawless
Diabolical; a serpent I dont worship satan

My words are evil tho and they create a perfect painting
Theres alot of anger pented up inside of me

Lived the life I dream about and scream it out excitedly
My minds a corridor that's dark and full of horror

I'm mentally depressed my life is stressed and full of sorrow
My mind is spinning like a rotary wheel

Getting older but im golden, I am older then steel
I got soldiers I am colder, spitting boulders for real

And I get doper every day that I stopped holding them pills!

CHORUS

Merkules: Merkules motherfucker!

The most savage on the planet, for a sandwich I will damage
Any rapper tryna manage

What I got they just can't stand it, Better can it! I dont plan it
Every fucking beat I ravage

It's established I'm a bastard, But my passions in this rapping
Every track I hit I slam it

You ain't half of what I be, keep it humble in the jungle
See me standing by the tree

I'm an emaculate MC,  I grab the cash and then I flee
Never tamper with this rapper, I'll detach you by the knees

I'm the cancer in the streets, you living half of what you speak
And a casket isnt cheap, I smell the laughter in defeat

The commander and the chief, at last I'm standing at my peak
Everlasting and unique, I keep on snapping over beats, I'm untamed

You cum stains get the memo yet, You faking what you're writting
So you live your life in retrospect, let it rest

Swing an iron fist, I got a metal chest, heavy set
Still I get it jumping son, I said it best!

CHORUS
