[Verse 1: Charron]
Now I'm rhyming like the climate of a Maui island
[?] while I'm growling like a mountain lion
Found Goliath I'm surviving while you're flower buying
Plus I've got the It factor so these clowns are dying
Sound of silence in my mind they think they found a virus
So it's time to wrap it up like I was pounding Cyrus
As a child, had problems always fitting in
I was wild and a zombie cause of Ritalin
Now I'm popping in the province that you living in
That is why I drop my rhymes with thoughts of nitroglycerin
Blowing up from the bodies I'm delivering
Bound to see a coffin like you swallowing some cinnamon
Challenge who can rap better, mad clever
Put him in the ground, coming down from a bad bender
Hit him with a flow til they froze I'm a [?]
If Usain Bolt you don't know about my track record

[Hook: Charron] {​​x2}​​
Write rhymes and I'm always on the go
Got more lines than Johnny Depp in Blow
Fight in my prime, punch like a pro
Straight bars no bullshit, enjoy the show

[Verse 2: Swisha T]
Stoned and stupid always rolling with an old [?]
I ain't going back on anything, I chose to do this
Co producing in the vocal booth, the vibe is perfect
Bi-polar cause I'm confident and kinda nervous
I don't do this for the riches, man this shit's a passion
All these faggots always rapping about the fucking fashion
Why you acting? I'm supposed to be impressed?
You boast that you're the best but you ain't posing any threat
Nah, you tried switching up your style but it's not working
See I'm the type to gut you up like a top surgeon
Stop searching for the fame, you gotta change your motives
Put your work in and remember not to hang with posers
Enjoy the show, light up your spliff and free your mind a bit
Haven't slept in weeks and I don't even know what time it is
'Bout to kill these pussies, stretch the fuck out they vagina lips
I should've wore protection now I'm catching all the viruses

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Madchild]
A neutron bomb with a blue tuk' on
Acting frugal at the store with a few coupons
Acting rich saying, "Pass the Grey Poupon."
Life's a bitch, old school so I still play Group Home
I don't keep Snoop on, it make me wanna smoke weed
And doing drugs again is something that I don't need
Don't fuck with me I guarantee you won't bleed
Mad skin, fucking thicker than an oak tree
I'm Hercules with the serpent's head in a circus tent
Cock like the hammer of Thor, I'll leave a perfect dent
Everybody know I'm crazy, I'm a nervous wreck
Three years ago I surfaced as a worthless vet
Underground again but every rapper under me
I'm hungry like a prisoner in Hungary
I said I'm Hungry you can hear my stomach grumbling
You think you're dope until you hear my verse, it's very humbling
Then try to catch what I am throwing but they're fumbling
The older me can kick the fucking shit outta the younger me
It's all family though love, just call me Uncle Maddy
Bruce Wayne in my mansion going fucking batty
I'll smoke a rapper like a fucking fatty
19 year old groupies saying, "You want me to suck it daddy?"
I'm like, "Of course I do!
Let me grab my iPhone and get a bird's eye view!"
