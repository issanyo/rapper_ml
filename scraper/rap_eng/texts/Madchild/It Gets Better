(I Don't Know if it gets better)
(I Don't Know if it gets better)
I never pray for stones but this house just ain't a home
I never pray for pain but sometimes that's what it takes to change
(I Don't Know if it gets better)
(I Don't Know if it gets better)

[Verse 1: Mad Child]
I made my share of bad mistakes and felt so much pain
Left a broken heart and left the people that I love drain
I've been to hell and back, You can tell 'em that
But now I'm back, Holding bars like I'm a fellon trapped
Spittin acapella raps, Opposite of hella whack,
Feeling like a kid again, rock like heavy metal tracks
I'm learning not to judge, Never call the kettle black
Close your black umbrella let the rain fall and just settle back
Let the water fall and let it wash away the pain
Rep the people on the fence cause I'm a monster that's insane
Stripes like zebra, We'll get what we deserve
This is not a fucking comeback, It's a rebirth

[Verse 2: Mad Child]
I had to go through all the suffering and the pain
To realize I've had enough and I finally want to change,
Had to smash the walls around that I had built for many years
I'm so happy now but man enough to say I've shed some tears
And I don't know whats wrong with me or why I self destruct
Why I built it up and tore it down and didn't give a fuck
Full of hatred full of anger, I've had just about enough
Now there's love in this volcano and I'm bout to just erupt
I'm bursting with personality, Thirst for a new reality
Lets rally up together and create a new mentality
Watch out for the poison cause this world is full of mad snakes
And I don't know for sure if it gets better but I have faith
