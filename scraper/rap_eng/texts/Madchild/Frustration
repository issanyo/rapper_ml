[Verse 1]

Hyperactive not nice when isolated
I’ll tag and drag a whole body bag we’re gang related
Wait it I haven’t made it, hate my life with a passion
Disposition’s like a demolition wishing I was crashed
Through my mental barricade but I’m afraid of what’ll happen
When I get paid for rapping, whose life is in a cluster, buster
Been a malfunction in my brain’s construction
Just an introduction of losing to my confusion
I thought I saw the light but it’s an optical illusion
Not optimistic, shoot ya, a futuristic plan not realistic
When acting enthusiastic, drastic measures have been taken so I can make it
Not successful, not triumphant
My blood rises fast past the maximum capacity
There has to be a way for me to find the right path to follow
Four years of pain hard to swallow
My head is not hollow I’ve got many thoughts collected
Strategic as a reject expected to be rejected
Check it
I’ve got to persist, resist the temptations
Stomp complications, patience is a virtue
I’ll hurt you if you disrespect my poetic creation
For real feel the frustration

[Hook 1] Scratches

These are feelings I’m expressing through my rhymes
These are feelings I’m expressing through my rhymes
These are feelings I’m expressing through my rhymes

[Verse 2]

Frustration sets in, internal combustion
The [?] panics from the volcanic explosion
In my abdominal cavity
Gravity holding me down, life bringing me down
Found I’m bound to blow a casket, asking am I a basket case
Face to face with my girl answer the question
A suggestion if I may don’t take too long to say
What’s on your mind about my rapping, starting to snap like jaws
Pausing for a moment examining her opponent
Not realizing she’s sizing me up to ease the pain
Shane, how do I love thee a lot, pushing and shoving
Not when you’re hot, so much has touched me
I’ll fucking walk, let’s talk it out, don’t shout, take a deep breath
And then count to ten when you control your temper
We’ll get along better I know you had to sell the Jetta
But get ahold of yourself, why? My love runs deep
Keep your chin up, you gotta have your head above water
A lot of people think your shit comes tight and they right
Now I might be pussywhippin' the girls pulled up beside of me
Don’t lie to me, yeah that’s fair I swear I’ll try to be
A better person, first rehearsal less cursing
Second checking that I don’t burst into a raging ball of anger
Hang a halo over your head cause you’re an angel
Strange, I promise I’m as honest as I can be
Maybe baby honey one some day I’ll trust you
One hundred percent, till then I’m [?] independent

[Hook 2] Scratches

These are feelings I’m expressing through my rhymes
These are feelings I’m expressing through my rhymes
These are feelings I’m expressing through my rhymes
These are feelings I’m expressing through my rhymes
I’ve been through hard times so many problems on my mind

[Verse 3]

This was written after sitting in a cell at the station
For twenty-six hours feel the power of frustration
Let me take you back to that second chapter
When I rapped about this girl who rocked my world
Shit got off cause I slapped her
Captivated by the sappy happy rappers just happened
I spoke in broken down English to distinguish a token of love
And appreciation, our relationship was good so I thought
Hadn’t fought in a while, they give me smile
I never learned who got burnt
Turned out I been betrayed
Found out she cheated I was heated so guess who’s afraid
I paid her a little visit, is it my fault
Assault is just an awful bust plus the level component
Timing I’ve had it bad dad cause they got me kidnapping
Slapping her in the face was a waste but I admitted it
And she was bad at the time, her crime was committed
Shit it just goes to show nobody can be trusted
Disgusted that I got busted who’s got a good lawyer for ya?
Thanks much I got ya watchin' my back, appreciate it
Hey, did you ever think for a minute, I’d end up in it
As a fucking loser who’s an abuser to the system
Pissed him off [?] Community. Can't watch a top notch cop stop my opportunity
Soon to be me, the MC to be guilty
I’d like to see that filthy face drink a [?]
And kiss my ass and the process the loss is great
I’m at a state of denial, taken to trial
But the judge ain’t gonna budge, I was told he holds a grudge
Against my defense so now I’m left in suspense

[Hook 3]

These are feelings I’m expressing through my rhymes
These are feelings I’m expressing through my rhymes
I’ve been through hard times so many problems on my mind
