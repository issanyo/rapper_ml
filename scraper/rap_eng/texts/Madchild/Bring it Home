(Moka Only) (Chorus)
Swollen, always, brings it home
(Swollen always brings it home)
We do it, up where, we belong
And Moka Only, always, brings it home
(Moka always brings it home)
Let's do it, up and, keep it on

(Prevail)
We built a foundation, brick by brick
Eye for an eye, keep your eyes on this
The shadows move in the strangest forms
Our music in your ear is like a dangerous storm
The way we perform, it's a whole new arena
We raise the stakes while you follow the leader
This song's a heater, long live the speaker
S&M the name explains the main feature

(Mad Child)
I'm an abnormal creature with pummelin' action
Feature presentation plus the comin' attraction
Asians, Iranians, all same opinion
Indians, blacks and whites and East Indians
Latins, girls draped in lace and satin
North Van to Venice, T-Dot to Manhattan
All get the picture, it's not quite invitin'
Mad Child's excitin', strike of white lightnin'

(Moka Only) (Chorus)

(Moka Only)
Where would we be in the world
If we never did our thing?
Please believe me it's my world
Everybody hear me sing now
If you've never heard of us I'm sorry you ain't hip
Here's another chance because we always come equipped
Moka love the ladies and the ladies lovin' Mok'
Ain't no need to argue cause we're just so fuckin' dope
Take it with a grain of salt or maybe with your drink
Thankin' Swollen Members cause they keep the party crank
Like dang dicky dicky dang dicky dang dang
Cause we bring it home, put it on, make it this way

(Prevail)
I stay low to the ground so I can keep my balance
The element of surprise, the advantage of silence
And all you root beer motherfuckers floatin' around
I pop your top you must be watered down
No fears of the glowin' lights of show biz
Young kids, I'll show you whose show it is
Swollen Members hits hard like Heartbreak Ridge
I put my heart into this, no alternative

(Mad Child)
That's affirmative, we burn with passion, smashin'
Flashin' on kids too concerned with fashion
Handlin' my business, we last longest
My whole congress, strong as King Kong is
Sledgehammer grammar, thunderbolt jolt
Mad Child what you got under your coat?
Adrenaline pump and I'm swingin' an axe
Swollen Members bring it home while Moka sing on the tracks

(Moka Only) (Chorus)

(Moka Only)
And Rob The Viking, always, brings it home
We do it, up where, we belong
And Moka Only, always, brings it home
(Moka always brings it home)
Let's do it, up and, keep it on
