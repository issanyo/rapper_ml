[Verse 1] Prevail
What I’m wanting is haunting but what I’m warning is forming in the form of a thick fog, heavy mist and a down pouring (so, yo)
Temples deteriorated, chapels abandoned
Hallows Eve, evil trees, black cats, witches and jack-o’-lanterns
Many keys with the pattern, identical to a cannon
Mental stamina stands without standing grammar and passion
The hard binges of destruction and chaos
I’ve been Avenged Sevenfold, I’ll let you know if your aims off
I’ll reappear with a butcher knife in your mirror and then put your life in a dangerous situation, so yeah
Primordial immortal score the sorcerers scale

[Verse 2] Madchild
I’m on my seventh cigarette in suicide hotel
Thinking that I’m gonna die if this don’t go well
Swear to god I want to try but it’s killing me inside
Man, you feeling me? I’m looking at the ceiling as I try, to pull myself together
There’s God and there’s the Devil
I only praise one? You’re hardly on my level
Madchild is the sun but my head’s in the clouds
I raised an army of rebels, you rap to a ‘crowd’...

And they’re not that loud
(Insane angel)
Insane angel

Beginning of a new era. It’s a new age
This is true terror, bitch, you’re two-faced
Style so sweet you got a tooth ache
You are dead meat, cut you into two steaks
‘Cause we are carnivores, you don’t want a war
Welcome to the dark carnival. I’m phenomenal
Abominable snowman here, I’m from the North
Deep inside your heart where it’s dark, that’s my source
