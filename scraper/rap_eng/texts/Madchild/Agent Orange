[Verse 1] Prevail
The size of the sickle
Full of nitrogen and nickel
It’s hard as fuck despite the icicles
That fall from cavern walls when
The God draws calls
The art to walk from tall
The saga of all
Claw, nail, Prevail
Hail the factors
The channel, the charm from the cradle
To the ladles in the sky that’s formed by clusters
To labels on our path that are formed by busters
The eyes of the reptile move in circles
And form all the skeptical live in person
My version of rampage in this age in time
Are from camp Agent Orange, I perform my songs blind
Raises in crimes, we should raise this on rhymes
We’ve been prime time viewing with the two of us combined
Losing your mind is a played out notion
We play with the strings in the cranial portion
Stereo versions don’t clash with the air played kings
We don’t say fair things
Where the knight wears wings
And draws human beings to the light of the inferno
Terminally ill spoken journal

[Verse 2] Madchild
Yo
Weight of the worlds on my shoulders boldly crack
And go where no man's gone before. Can't hold me back
Attacking with passion, that's my passion
It's a rush, smashing with cannonball crush, bust
Ashes to dust from us to you
We busting through
Speak of violence, yo, cause that's what I'm accustomed to
Hold up. Now who the fuck you think your talking to
Madchild, this is a bear trap you walked into
If danger's in the air we prepare for war
If you cross our path then we'll settle the score
Get on your knees and put your head on the floor
As calmly said after we kick in the door
I'm not making this for the weak minded
They won't find it nice
But nice guys finish last in this fucked up life
Knives and unfair fights and
Breaking into cars in the middle of the night for excitement
That's where I came from. That's where the days went
Twelve packs, friends cracking heads into the pavement
Some stayed the same, some of us changed
I guess that's why at times I seem a little bit strange
