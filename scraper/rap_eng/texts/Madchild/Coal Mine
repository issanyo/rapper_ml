(Verse 1 - Madchild)
Lyrics that I spit can seem unsettling
Rap like Iâ€™m on ephedrine and ornithine, sprinkled with amphetamine
Glass man standing, the last man standing
Not too many make it back from a bad crash landing
I was flyin' higher than a jet
Now I'm clean so every lyrics that I spit is fuckin' wet
I'm a vet, I'm a king. Canadian, a mystic mind
To the States I'm an alien like District 9
I am back, I am hot, got a fish to fry
Open my mouth and let the bullets from the pistol fly
I am finished with these thugs, causin' mischief guy
So the past can kiss my ass, that's a kiss goodbye

(Chorus)
Madchild, I'm under ground like a coal mine
But I'm about to strike it rich like a gold mine
Superbeast, I'm young at heart but got an old mind
I want it all so I am giving you the whole nine
Prev1, he's underground like a coal mine
But I'm about to strike it rich like a gold mine
Superbeast, I'm young at heart but got an old mind
I want it all so I am giving you the whole nine

(Verse 2- Prevail)
No shatter-proof plexiglass can save you from the battle axe
They're just too sharp, cut straight through. My autograph
Illegible, but still says Prevail in the boldest print
Rhyme anarchist, overthrowin' rap government
Superbeast and Predator, deadliest of hunting parties
A very impressive army, we're burying many bodies
Carrying pitchfork and torch through the castle ground
Master of confusion watch the little monster chop you down
Then I grind down the bone, spread all the dust about
Trust me you're rusty, I'm animal style, In & Out
When in doubt, ask for a professionals opinion
Blasting caps, TNT, my dynamite provision
Enriching my livings a given, so we Mad Max
Madchild, Prevail, Rob the Viking, we want rap back
Diamondback, Black Mamba, Lawnmower Man
Watch the blade spitters blade, one that's made from the pen again

(Chorus)
Madchild, I'm under ground like a coal mine
But I'm about to strike it rich like a gold mine
Superbeast, I'm young at heart but got an old mind
I want it all so I am giving you the whole nine

(Verse 3- Madchild)
I'm the reigning champ, I'm the reigning champ
Make these other rappers look like they're in training camp
Drugs fuckin' suck, they will drain your bank
I'm the greatest, I'm inflated, got my brain to thank
Rap like I'm infected in the head
Lyrics that I spit could fuckin' resurrect the dead
Actin' like a lunatic, rappin' like a wild boy
Told you motherfuckers you don't wanna look inside boy
Fuck shit up like the Taliban in hammer pants
Call the fuckin' ambulance, cuz I'ma cause an avalanche
Brighter than a lava lamp, throw you in the mud fucker
My skin is shinin' like a diamond, I'm a blood sucker
Indestructible, a circus freak side show
Doper than a hundred pounds of hydro on fire bro
I'm still here, I provide a new identity
Creeping through your mind like a centipede on ketamine

(Chorus)
Madchild, I'm under ground like a coal mine
But I'm about to strike it rich like a gold mine
Superbeast, I'm young at heart but got an old mind
I want it all so I am giving you the whole nine
Prev1, he's underground like a coal mine
But I'm about to strike it rich like a gold mine
Superbeast, I'm young at heart but got an old mind
I want it all so I am giving you the whole nine
