(Verse 1)

Yo, 57 shows and I'm back on the job, had to wait five days to get this fat, ugly slob
I'm a worldwide legend, you irrelevant goof, your artist Merkules is ten times better than you
And you afraid to be yourself, no testicles, no backbone
Finish with a show, you put your spectacles back on
What's wrong within yourself? You trynna change you image?
Sayin' I got hair plugs, what is your brain diminished?
With a ski mask actin' like a villain and salty
I'm Brad Pitt bitchin' this is 'Killin' Them Softly'
I walk on a red carpet, you stuck in a black campus
Spit nothin' but wack garbage, I'm stompin' on Snak's carcass
While laughin', my raps darkens, I grind till my axe sharpens
Let's go to the park, bitch, take it back to the Clock Parkers
Next time I'm seein' Snak, he's gettin' cracked in the head, you can't kill me bitch, 'cause I'm already back from the dead
You rap like Sticky Fingers but got damage to your brain, only places that you know: Greece, Canada and Spain
Want my spot so bad, you lie and wake at night suffering, I've won this game twice and still ain't achieved nothing..
You're liar, angry at the world, you are phony and I ain't touched coke in over three years, so blow me
I took the kid on tour
