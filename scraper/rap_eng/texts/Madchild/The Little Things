[Verse 1: Madchild]
I spit toxic and poisonous fumes, fans have been exposed
Writing 'till my pen explodes, fucking centerfolds
Fully tatted Dennis the Menace, I'm wearing tennis clothes
Make a grip like I'm an octopus with giant tentacles
Fully respectable spectacle I get technical
Holding bars like my brains a giant receptacle
My molecular structure makes me invincible
Started off the head of the class, now I'm the principal
Shit, almost every move I make it is insensible
Make mistakes and fix it like the shit I did's intentional
Life is full of sadness, method to my madness
Write another (that's that shit!) and add ad-libs
People, watch for venomous snakes and hungry vultures
Cause their two faced, Nicholas Cage and John Travolta
Might be slightly schizo, but I'm not two-faced
Pay for one, get a song, listeners get the group rate

[Hook: Madchild]
Ay yo, I write raps, save money and stay drug free
I don't let the little things in life bug me
If you love what I'm doing come up and hug me
All of us are beautiful, none of us are ugly
Nobody's looking down at me cause God's above me
Forget your troubles, people; everything is lovely
Work out, eat healthy and stay drug free
And write raps, I don't let the little things bug me

[Verse 2: Joseph Rose]
Yeah, I spent too many years using and dealing
It's been a long time healing
Sobriety, such a strong feeling
Now that my head's clear I keep filling it up with different ways to stack paper to the world's ceiling
But, being alive is a good enough feeling
I'm just happy to be a healthy man, eatin' and breathin'
Living comfortably enough to not be stealin' and cheatin'
Travellin' the globe, rippin' shows in the Colosseum
My life's a fucking dream
I put my live long and prosper symbol in the air and change the whole scene
Fuck the industry, I own my own corporation
Growing organic roots, building sustainable foundations
I guess you could call me a master mason
Piling up chips higher than the jackpot in the basement
Waiting for the right investment to come my way
I wanna feed my family for at least a couple generations

[Hook: Madchild]
Ay yo, I write raps, save money and stay drug free
I don't let the little things in life bug me
If you love what I'm doing come up and hug me
All of us are beautiful, none of us are ugly
Nobody's looking down at me cause God's above me
Forget your troubles, people; everything is lovely
Work out, eat healthy and stay drug free
And write raps, I don't let the little things bug me

[Verse 3: Madchild]
Ay, rappers need to vacate
Chuckling with Chuckie, Huckleberry Hound and Grape Ape
One of us is not the same, I make pay
Smashin' rappers like a Greek says "opa" then he breaks plates
Ask Mikey he likes it, he said it tastes great
Smashing bitches in the bushes since the eighth grade
Kids are thirsty for lyrics, I will replenish you
Supreme teen tatted wearing a cardigan and tennis shoes
Little amateur spitters, I will diminish you
Hit and finish little minuscule fools from middle school
Aye, I'm the victor of the vocalists
Hot and hopping like an acapulco on a pogo stick
Terror strikes on you parasites
So many terabytes, generals got a pair of stripes
Barred barbarian, bow when the baron strikes
Tearing mics, verses hotter than two hundred Fahrenheit

[Hook: Madchild]
Ay yo, I write raps, save money and stay drug free
I don't let the little things in life bug me
If you love what I'm doing come up and hug me
All of us are beautiful, none of us are ugly
Nobody's looking down at me cause God's above me
Forget your troubles, people; everything is lovely
Work out, eat healthy and stay drug free
And write raps, I don't let the little things bug me
