[Verse 1: Demrick]
I'm always searching for the setup
Mother told her son "Boy better never let up"
I’ve been fed up, keep your head up, I'mma do this shit forever
Close my eyes watch letters come together, better than whoever died
They better never not, murk 'em on the spots
Swervin' on some shots, puffin' pot, this ain’t what you want
On the block, talk a lot, parking lot, barber shop
So I’m in the studio groovin' in the ambiance
Try and be a Capitan, think you’ll be a happy man
Trash can competitions, send them in an ambulance
Taliban, contraband, bitch do the molly dance
Make it out without a chance, livin down at Zombieland
My mind is all twisted, I need a smoke
They hope, I go over the edge without a vote
But nope, these quotes have overcome the impossible
Don't think that they ain't watching you
Nobody's safe

[Hook: Demrick]
Me and my niggas yeah we play for keeps
We in the streets everyday just trying to eat
It's fuck the rest till I rest in peace
I can't let the enemy see the end of me
Thats why nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe

Yeah, it ain’t safe nigga (Nah)
Jarren Benton

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
My pen is poisonous, secrete on your girlfriend’s orifice
Politic with God, said make love to a sorceress
Twist kush like a contortionist
Skimming through thesauruses to find the perfect synonym to slaughter shit
Yeah, I’ve been tryna make a dollar, Dear
Fucking four bitches for perc and petting koala bears
I'm Alfred Hitchcock on PCP
Spillin' vodka for my nigga restin' 6 feet deep
I’m a legend in the making, these other rappers are bacon bits
Too much time in the music, fuck up relationships
Bitch breathe, got chloroform on a handkerchief
Be standing ovation, I spoke at the player's banquet
Fuck wit' me cause you stuck wit' me
I give a shit about your 2 cents nigga, here catch a buck fifty
Underneath the bubble goose, a tool that’ll cut kidneys
We in this motherfucker styrofoam cup with me

[Hook: Demrick]
Me and my niggas yeah we play for keeps
We in the streets everyday just trying to eat
It's fuck the rest till I rest in peace
I can't let the enemy see the end of me
Thats why nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe

[Verse 3: Madchild]
Aye, Underground Kings, swing swords like we Turkish
The worst version of personal verse murkers
Spookiest nucliest kookiest conquest
So nobody's safe like a nuclear bomb threat
Young De dabbed till his lungs full of crystals
We kung fu fist, all these young tongue twisters
Very mental , listen and say "The Demented"
Kill it on a hoppa instrumental, now with Jarren Benton
Aye, I am asshole smurf
Money spread across the floor like it's AstroTurf
I met a groupie, almost had a heart attack
Fucked her then I came in her face and called it an autograph
Told you that right after I nut I won't call you
West coast Bax-War killers with Funk Volume
Angry, I'm bady, a Gladiator mayne
We are hungry, salivate with alligator fangs
I'm from an asylum, wild tribal and violent
Won’t catch me sleeping, I sliced both of my eyelids
I'm vibrant , vampire and lycan, a hybrid
White like i'm Rye bread and write like a tyrant

[Hook: Demrick]
Me and my niggas yeah we play for keeps
We in the streets everyday just trying to eat
It's fuck the rest till I rest in peace
I can't let the enemy see the end of me
Thats why nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
Nobody, nobody's safe
