[Intro]
My name is {*rewinds*} my name is
And we've made a wild and wonderful record for you
We will tell you all kinds of things to do and be
And you can let your imagination go with us
Open up to what we say; this is where the magic starts

[Mad Child]
Yeah~!
Underground rapper with the firearm
Sick dialogue, words stick like iron-ons
Crowd surfing and wrestling with fans
To a burnt out desolate man - guess who I am
Flipping bricks from a brick phone, to a flip phone
Thought I had it made, switched zip codes
Used to get high cause I'd get bored
Felt like I was, felt like I was
Felt like I was falling from a plane, no rip cord
Now I'm back and I got nothing to lose
Mad Child, I tear it up in the booth
Fuck material objects I got serious problems
Same shit, now I'm dealing with delirious goblins
Thought I wanted to be king so I wore a crown
Started from the bottom, built an empire and torn it down
Not Rockefeller, more like Mr. Cinderella
And I'm standing in the rain with a ripped umbrella
That's the, that's the
That's the nature and the danger of the streets
Angel with the piece and the anger of a beast
I was going one way but running out of luck
So I'm back and I'm grinding like an independent truck
I thought of flying the coop
But I'mma stay put and spit fire while I try and recoup

[Prevail]
Red cedar, evergreen, oak tree, sequoia
Black back peace chief, Battle Axe Warrior
Dagger in the Mouth like a pirate ship
And a highly classified nanobyte microchip
Scanners fiber light from my eyes guide ships to the passage
My mind shifts gears to the literary classics
Follow orders, protect the Battle Axe borders, defend the headquarters
Beware of sharks who can only swim in shallow waters
A beacon of lumens, speak the language of humans
A spice trade, the words mixed like fresh herbs and cumin
You don't want to see my +Boys+ get +Beastie+ Rick Rubin
This writing coming to me real natural like Truman
Capote, peyote, coyotes and jackals
My team is real +Predatory+ but we ain't from +Nashville+
You calling for us, we are Battle Axe Warriors, defend the fortress
Beware of darkness or forever live in shallow coffins

[Mad Child]
Mad Child stepping on the scene like Batman
Gold wings coming out my supreme backpack
I'm old school, hardcore like Black Flag
Chasing rappers down, I chomp 'em up like Pac-Man
Break you off bitch, I ain't got an off switch
Started off underground, head like an ostrich
Then I became obnoxious
And started selling records then I started popping Oxys
Shit, I was flossing, I can't believe I lost it
And everything we stand for
Fans felt lost, arms crossed they demand more
Which left me at a standstill
Guilt weighing heavy on my mind like an anvil
I can't remember a day that I didn't have pills
Quit painkillers, now I'm only taking Advil (Advil.. Advil..)
