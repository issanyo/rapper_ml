[Intro: Mad Child]
This is the realest shit I ever wrote..
What's fear? Fear is an emotion
What is death?

[Verse 1: Mad Child]
Dark and mysterious, art of a lyricist
Misguided angel, I'm dangerous, period
Life's simple, perish or you own it
Bury your opponent and cherish every moment
Mad Child's fly like a helicopter
Plus I am still hella sick, tell a doctor
I'm revitalized, please don't idolize me
Only one G.O.D
The ceremony of our innocence is drowned
Seen evil clowns and they're dancing all around
I don't cry at funerals, I cry during movies
There's something wrong with me, I'm deeply wounded
This is "Do Or Die," try it with the ruined mind
I have slept with more than two girls committing suicide
Look into the mirror, memories are monsters
Grip the sink, blood gushing out my nostrils
I'm thinking 'bout the pain that I've inflicted
Entering the world of shame, become a victim
I feel death circling, no plans of leaving
Look into my eye, see a soul barely breathing

[Hook: Mad Child]
What's fear? Fear is an emotion
Love is an addiction, death is when the soul leaves the body
When the spirit leaves the shell
Make home heaven cause this world's a living hell
What's hate? Hatred comes from jealousy and greed
Everybody take more than everybody need
Be the devil's plaything or pray up above
Pure hatred also stems from true love

[Verse 2: Prevail]
I've lived part of my life Poe like Edgar Allen
My friends told me I should never go to Shutter Island
Cut glass like a diamond and then fall through the atrium
My life's falling apart, the shard's in my cranium
Sharks in my aquarium, my body in a pine box
Too heavy to carry, I'm just bury him here
Plus he was never married, no kids, so who cares?
No mercy in this universe, you had some good years
And Prev, right through there, is a bright lighted tunnel
Your cousin, your aunt, your grandma, your uncle
They all await you, this world overrates you
And fate is a cruel joke, but wait, can you break through?
My breath has finally returned to my chest
Never played by the rules so I had to cheat death
You believe in second chances if you change the circumstances?
Cause for everyone that fails means another one advances
Prevail had no father, doesn't mean that he's a bastard
I got love for my mama, sister, grandmother and grandpa
The history of cancer, illness and deficiencies
So everyday above ground I take that as a victory

[Hook]
