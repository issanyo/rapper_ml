[Verse 1]
I’m an underground hip hop tycoon
You’re a kite dancing in the wind, I’m a typhoon
This isn’t a miserable prison, this is my room
Mad’s a cowboy having a showdown a high noon
Who wants to step, I welcome you to the test
Only marketing isn’t shit, but I’m arguably the best
When I’m not on drugs and I’m obviously not on meds
I’m a pirate, I’ll steal your gold in mahogany wooden chests
And I’m back to fucking groupies, massagin' me on my bed
I don’t answer the phone at night ‘cause I’m probably getting head
I’m a hobbling goblin gobbling rappers that think they’re problems here
Said I’m a goblin bitch, but down for robbing your shit
Haters and doubters have probably thought I’m dead
Got you stuck on stupid, a wobbling bobblehead
You think you're funny you dummy I'm making money bitch
Talking shit in the rain, out here it's fucking sunny bitch
And on this harbor, no harboring, no resentment
But on that harbor I marvel it all to tension
And people think that i'm walking 'round with my henchmen
While scheming and plotting vengeance
That's not even my intentions
My psycho analysis from psycho analysts
I'm psycho and a risk, iPhone's camera click
I video my show with the lights on in a dark room
Light six hundred candles lit, in case I go ham and shit
They hope to catch me having a meltdown again
Like, my skull's a microwave and my brain's a banana split
But I can handle it, hold the mic with a hammer grip
Got rid of all the bad companionship's
Now they're like Manny rips

Animal Fight (x2)

[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm running this division again, it's mine, I ran it
I've gave some people a chance, but shit, I've had it
I'm holding on to bars and I can see their eyes panic
Hit with every sentence so hard, it's like time added
The sharpest knife in the drawer when I grind at it
I'm adding, climatic line pattern, rhyme addict
Vicious on the streets and I still got some enforcers
And my listeners, they know my psychological tortures
Yo, I'm climbing from the bottom still
Black Chanel Balaclava, diamond bottom grill
Two missions completed, got one mission left
Spit with every vicious breath, it's the kiss of death
Your shit is leaking, wouldn't want to be in your boat
Back here to turn all of these animals into fur coats
So get the fuck out of my way homie, vámonos
Knocking over everyone at once, line of dominoes
Madchild, I am colder than the winter games
Little Rocky playing hockey in Versace vintage frames
Did some dumb shit that got some Warriors nervous
Back to murdering, i'm burden with a glorious purpose
Stand 5 foot 7 but I still hear some rambling
If i'm a dwarf, i'm worth money like a 4 foot companion
A champion that can't be in that state of mind for too long
The blue's gone, the true strong survived. Time to move on
