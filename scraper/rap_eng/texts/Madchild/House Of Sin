[Intro: Mad Child]
Yo, I'm a Tasmanian Devil, Prevail's the Roadrunner
Rob the Viking, wow!

[Verse 1: Mad Child]
I love beats by the Viking and the Alchemist
People get inside my head like John Malkovich
My life is getting complicated like calculus
I feel like jumping off a bridge or a balcony
So sometimes I sit around, might sulk a bit
But still I'm holding on tight like a Vulcan grip
Instead of thinkin' 'bout the suicide that I'll commit
I'm pulling killer crazy words from the alphabet
Cooped up, sometimes I gotta leave the house and shit
Otherwise my life will turn into the House of Sin
I'm running into old friends asking, "How've you been?"
I lost three million dollars dog, how've you been?
My teeth are falling out my head so my mouth don't grin
My teeth are rotten and there's holes in my couch and shit
Yeah, every day reminders, the truth it hurts
Cause I got cigarette burns in my Gucci shirts
Yo, Mad Child, I never write a goofy verse
But still I stare into the mirror thinking, "You've been cursed."
Listen to your song, I have to pop a roofie first
Cause I am nuclear, when I walk in a booth it's church

[Hook 1: Mad Child]
I'm on some Bruce Lee, Enter The Dragon shit
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon shit
We are warriors, Red Dragon kid
There's warmth under the wing of the dragon bitch

[Hook 2: Mad Child]
I'm on my kung-fu hustle
My black 6-9 Mustang, it got muscle
Last Samurais don't hide, we just rush em
You wanna be street now? We gonna crush em

[Verse 2: Prevail]
I'm the Swollen Army General, we gonna swarm on you
My performance quite like neo-Moulin Rouge
I'm a cut into your crew like some Cordon Bleu
I'm sipping on some Grand Dame, you drinking Cuvee Brut
I make your heart skip a beat like it's new Beirut
And if you don't know what to do then you should stay on your stoop
People always ask me what part do I play in the group
What do I say? I'm just a dude in a Tom Ford suit
Space face erase cartoon, you dudes is Betty Boop
Make a tune and break bread and then get jetty with the loot
Play around the Greyhound and squeeze the juice out your grapefruit
Prev-one Ketel One, Belvedere, or Grey Goose
Major league beat down, a homerun, a Babe Ruth
Major labels always wonder when we gonna break loose
Can't stop the profit motherfucker, I'm like Jeru
S&M it's us again, our people know we stay true
I'm on some Apocalypse Now
Behind enemy lines like Black Hawk Down
The Shining, The Crazies, The Happening, The Town
Keep your eyes wide shut when the crows come around
