[Verse One: Prevail]
When I grew up, was I poor? I'd have to say "nope"
But I'd say yes to broke, you can even ask Mok'
He's met both of my folks, I bet the Dagger I'm Cloak
My hope is coconuts and coco skin women from Kokomo
I won't blow my first million up in smoke like a villain
That's how you get hooked on glass pipes with low ceilings
Fucking hookers for the feeling
Get jacked up, jumping off the roof of A.M.P. for the B.B.C. Museum
I don't want mine in dimes and nickles, I want big bills
So I can spend it with my people
I'll be thrifty (why?)
Cause I know I can't take it with me
Mad Child, Moka, Ab', Rob The Vik' and Buc Fifty
Mr. Brady, LMNO
No dust to settle, Mr. Swan's on the boards and levels
We've come to prove that we can move and lose them with the tempo
And now you're riding with the rebels, we all have potential
We're young, we'll make millions

[Verse Two: Moka Only]
Brilliance
Shake pavilions
Take Brazilian girls into my world, show 'em what "real" means
Kill fiends with extra tapes on Mammal music
Hear shrill screams as freaks tweek they body, don't confuse it
With another guy, once the fuse lit
Discover the high heights then you lose it completely
I don't compete
Retreat the heat seekers to a universal audio Freak Nic
And speak free
Unique looking
Yellow with good hair
I own a triton and I love gripping up wood snares
Rim shots forever
Since way back in the woods where
Me and Prev' came from and everybody woods there
I have no trouble bubbling a little something
That's better than 12 years for nothing
Kept the love intact
And the buzz in rap
Got my name on it
My cousin Ab' stamps his brain on it
I'm loving math, read 'em and take on it
I'm sipping coffee the brain tonic
Remain sonic
Ripping awfully cold
Heating up like a waffle mode
Put a little something in the billfold we real bold

[Hook: Abstract Rude] {x2}
To make millions
Takes a brilliant mind
A very valiant effort with many hills to climb
Get hurt feelings
Though they will heal in time
You're here for now accept it and never kill in crime

[Verse Three: Mad Child]
Yeah I don't go to parties no more, people ask me, "How come?"
Self made millionaires, that's the outcome
This Libra Scorpio ain't rich but getting close is
Getting kids upset writing shit I'm not suppose to
What happened to the mystical world and next dimension?
Dragons and vikings, yo, pay attention
I've been there before, had freestyles for days
I remember taking people through my lyrical maze
Back when money wasn't shit, went through my spiritual phase
Back then I didn't have a care in the world, life's fantastic
Laughing, watching walls breathe and dropping acid
Blasting ears off [?] from backside boneless
To loss of track of time, to face plant to homeless
I found out that the joke is, that I was the brokest
Now I'm out to feed my camp and I'ma never lose my focus
So don't provoke us from trying to stack these ends
While keeping substance in my verses and fans as friends
So I'ma keep my backpack in the backseat of my Benz

[Verse Four: Abstract Rude]
I done, dealt with millions and helped your children
Changed their ways, conceived by greed of pilgrims
I hailed a stack we bailed 'em out
I failed to adapt at mama's house
And when I moved out
We're closer now, her child has grown
So much style on the microphone the crowds will roar
And pay at the door and stay until four
And begging for more and we don't ignore
How thirsty you are and deserving of fame
Effort you give for earning you gain
What level do you reach without burning pain?
Pressure and strain to be above the grain
And vanity's vain but for calamity claims me
I ain't gon' let this game drive me crazy

[Hook]
