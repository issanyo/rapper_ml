[Hook: Prevail]
My stereo buries your stereo
It's a sound burial when I talk I sound imperial
My stereo buries your stereo
It's a sound burial when I talk I sound imperial
My stereo buries your stereo
It's a sound burial when I talk I sound imperial
My stereo buries your stereo
It's a sound burial when I talk, when I talk

[Verse One: Prevail]
Then I mock
Competition, them I drop
They just wishin', that I'd stop
Like a western, Deadwood shot
My profession, they don't talk
One condition, when I rock

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Prevail]
Twelve o'clock, red eye flight, dead of night
Set my sights on the city of lights
Give me that mic, believe in that hype
Believe me I'm right
A pretty young lady trying to give me advice
Hit the mile high club, you gotta feel the height
For real it's tight
Right there, that's what I like
Energy spikes, party ignites
They wild and fight, the whole crowd out loud proudly recites
That...

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Mad Child]:
I'm the Mad Child to make murderous material
Wake up in the morning and I eat my cereal
Serial murderer, that's why I'mma murder ya
That's right I'm a master have to ask I never heard of ya
Bad man standing on the corner of 33rd
Flip a couple birds because I prefer to do my dirty work
Dangerous in solitude I will demolish you
Dudes don't want to rendezvous when I'm not fond of you
I've been through it, I'm into it
You influence
You ain't done it
I soul stunted
You got a small group of stupid friends who pretend
Me? I got a big group of super men that you can't duplicate
We worldwide, do some girl/guy cookie movers
I'm from Vancouver we move mass units and flip bricks
Thousand keys across the boarder even when the shit's thick
Shit I'mma buy fame kid
Hop on my train
Hip hop, try again
I spit rock from fire brains
Spike metal ball on an iron chain
Cry in vain

[Hook]

[Verse Four: Mad Child]
I was born and raised to go out on a stage
Explode into a rage and go out in a blaze
I was born and raised to go out on a stage
Explode into a rage and go out in a blaze
That's what's happenin' when Mad Child is rappin' in the place to be
You can't fuck with me, face it G
I'm especially fresh to death, there's no replacing me
I'm basically the best, no escaping us I'm papered up
If he's actin' like a stupid fuck duck, tape him up
Life, we don't make it up
Take, until I make enough
God, what have I become?
Some young dumb idiot
Tried to step up and get up in my meridian
And that's when I get mad
That's when I get rid of 'em
That's cause they was on the same same bullshit again
