[Intro]
Chaos in the streets [x8]

[Hook]
Chaos in the streets
Hunger in your teeth
Strong from the weak
Nature of the beast
[x2]

[Verse 1]
I got thoughts in my head and they are not right
Lyrics is so cold I'll give you motherfuckers frost bite
I'm ferocious. Every line is like a dog bite
Mentally disturbing like how people bet on dog fights
Off white. I never got to go to prom night
Put myself in stupid situations. Not a calm life
I keep on thinking I'll strike gold like it's a Klondike
Cards are stacked against me like I'm trying to fuck a blonde dyke

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hulk's back. Almost drowned; I had to float back
Now I'm hanging rappers like they're jackets on a coat rack
I got myself a little something; was a broke cat
Make the crowd go 'Boom! Boom!' You're a rope trap
Hoping I am warping into something that is great
I'm so sick, they say it must have just been be something that he ate

[Hook]
