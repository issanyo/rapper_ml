Hey, I’m hanging on by a thread
People walk away from me for wrong that I said
Memories like ghosts still haunting my head
Tryin to change my ways but I’ll stay armed till I’m dead (uh-oh)
Hey I’m hanging on by a thread
Girls should walk away from me for wrong that I did
Memories like ghosts still haunting my head
Tryin to change my ways but I’ll stay armed till I’m dead (uh-oh)

[Verse 1]

I’m hanging on by a thread
People looking at me like whats wrong with this kid
I guess I didn’t realize the harm that it did
Cause everybody thought that I was stronger than this
What happened to the passion
Yeah fashion
He was smashing with the conquering fist
King Kong with a twist
Thank god my addiction wasn't longer than this
I admit it yeah this song sound possessed and suppressed
But Madchild’s back not worn i'm still super
Orange stormtrooper with the strength to lift my group up in a four door or a Ford coupe with the roof down
Nobody wanna hear their favorite group with a new sound
I understand why the fan became anxious
I don’t wanna hear the Beastie Boys become gangsters
I promise that there gonna be no more tricks
It wasn’t me, it was the devil red 6 6 6

[Verse 2]

Flyin' blue unicorns, blonde Japanese girls in private schools uniforms
I don’t really know who I am anymore
By now I should probably have a family of four
Devil on my patio then ran through my door
Bit me then he kicked me, beat me down to the floor
I remember rocking shows fans on the floor
Now I’m sitting on the couch with my hand down my drawers
Now I’m the joke to my friends
Instead of Pepsi in a Beamer
Doin' coke in a Benz
Still the shit when I hit bars
The adrenaline I spit with could lift cars
I've never met an animal I didn’t like
But almost every man I bang em with the hammer and a spike
Last five years down the drain, I’m in a pickle
I do whatever like I’m Russian, hammer and a sickle
Brain broken like I forgot the alphabet
Thank God for
Evidence and Alchemist
Rob The Viking
Madlib and Joey Chavez
Fuck the mainstream dawg we the A-Team
This is Clockwork Orange
Everything I'm making dope like clockwork form
Fuck you, fuck her, fuck him, and fuck them!
