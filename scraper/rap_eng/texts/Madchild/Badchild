[Verse 1]
High roller that’s bipolar
Bubbling but still missing something like I’m diet cola
Trying to boss up like Tony Soprano
I’m still a boss like I’m Joseph Bonanno
Feel stranded on an island like I’m Gilligan
Lost a couple teeth, went back to the grill again
Fans acting like it’s killing them, these cheap tricks
Wasn’t working so I went and got my teeth fixed
Known for saying harsh remarks that are partially dark
Samples chopped like it’s martial arts
Can’t complain, kids like my art
But feel like, I’m still waiting for my life to start
Last three months catatonic, feeling miserable
Walk around my city and I feel like I’m invisible
Never felt like I had to ask if I'm dope
Now I'm Casper the Ghost tight grasping for quotes

[Bridge]
Can't really explain
It's like a gapin' hole in the back of my head

[Verse 2]
Panic in my legs, feel heavy while I hallucinate
Standing on a ledge about to jump but I'll rejuvenate
Holding on, but I hope it’s soon
‘Cause pills the only way I know to patch these open wounds
Responsibility, literally killing me
Life used to sparkle. Nothing’s fucking thrilling me
Used to sit and gather my words, called it artillery
Now life is torture, would gladly end it willingly
Reason I’m still here are for my dogs and my family
I don’t expect anyone to understand me
When I was young loved Suicidal Tendencies
Now I'm older, I got suicidal tendencies
Might be punished for my sins, that would make sense
Stars align once, haven't had a break since
Maybe I should lower the bar, it's raised too high
Maybe I should work harder, but I do try
Used to walk around, thank god I'm the shit
Now feel like a piece of shit in a bottomless pit
Trying to build my strength like Bane so I can climb out
But life moves so fast, I need a time out
