[Intro: Son Doobie]
A microphone is a beautiful thing, speak ya mind
Fuckin, look at, look at fuckin madchild and his gerber baby fuckin haircut

[Verse 1: Son Doobie]
Chicky chick ah, we puff the stuff daily
Hey hooray bless the tray lord save me
Take one for you two for me son pay me
89 seven set and let out crazy
Cafe open 1:30 in the am
The street vigilante real do or die agent
The sworn statement, Son look how we came in
The mental patient will make you move on the pavement
Heinous gold mic assault, ill, famous, nameless
Remind me how Son Doobie reign it
Hippie hold on, more funk, Swollen kick it
Stick it til they ?ev? party people come get with it

[Hook: Sun Doobie (Madchild)]
Madchilds commited(Yeah thats right)
Prevails comitted(A for life)
Sundoobies commited(A West Coast)
All tha sickest MC's world wide we the illest
Cause ya'll is commited(Can't be stoped)
And they's commited(Straight Hip-Hop)
And we's commited(For life, a for life)
So feal this one-two S&M come the realist

[Verse 2: Prevail]
In the wild witching hour when the sun sets
I've learned to outrun ships of outlaws and cutthroats
Some spoke of who knows where I'll turn up
The streak from our recorded scores could torch Europe
The overhand thrust is a motion not to trust or confide in
Cause I wield the trident like Poseidon
My last slip knot hangs for shanghai surprise
The last of my crew is skeleton by design
Cannon balls crush courtyards and those courted
Those falsely supported its been duly noted
Unruly, roguish and sordid constrewn crews
I've strewn body parts, make art in the arcs of the moon

[Interlude: Mad Child]
A Prev-one come ill like that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mad Child]
Iron magic Black Sabbath and Tabitha
Control freaks on power trips heathens and masochists
Powder electrocutes executive executes
Primal expressionist is to purify wizardry age
Withering strength and swiftness of the beast
Indulge triumphant feast the hunter moves in circles
Enter the spirit world sliced by samurai
Unphotogenic schizophrenic and camera shy
Carnivorous cretin evil cartoon character
Triple aces faces of death breath replaces
Empty spaces explicit embraces
The dream chaser lifelong commitance
Brass knuckles white fists cue ball in a sock
Mad Child rocks mohawks and tomahawks

[Hook]

[Hook: Madchild]
R.S.C, thats right, we come the illest
