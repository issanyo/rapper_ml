[Verse 1: Mad Child]
Enter the depth of the mindstate of a sick man
Blood lust, slow suction like quick sand
Sharpened gilloutine that cuts clean, you can't hang
An iron plate in my head, strike with rattlesnake fangs
Im ill, especially when guts start to spill
Quick fix, addicted to steep bills and cheap thrills
Never underestimate my grasp, a reach that can surpass
Outlast, making you gasp for air, and i dont care about the friction
Ill kick sand in your face and then walk like an egytption
Out there amidst pyramids, depict non-fiction
Writin our rhymes with dell and hyrogliphic transcription
Imagine madchild rating a beauty pageant
Daddys doing damage, plus im making cabbage
Macho man Randy Savage of rap, violent vanity
One step ahead, cuz im aware of my insanity

[Hook]
Underground forever, sinful bliss
Form your love made from us, thats infamous
No doubt, but with a strange new twist
Let your whole mind frame rearrange to this
Underground forever, sinful bliss
Form your love made from us, thats infamous
No doubt, but with a strange new twist
Let your whole mind frame rearrange to this

[Verse 2: Prevail]
Man you get what you deserve for the way you mascerade
But with p ones like it dancing torpedo parade
Coronary charts reamain well within the range
How many heavy dosages before we blow your brain
You recognize my size and the wickets in the sofa
Theres a high percentage that you get bent by the butcher
Just a note to my peers, who solemnly believe
That escape infection on the dawn of a paracetical eve
Theres a parallel state where floors, even walls breathe
This insallation will instantly make your heart seize
I spit a heat of rhyme inferno that will burn your chassy
As they say where im from, your done when your eyes are glassy
Wear the glass to the death of the village idiot
Where i consider it, no need for a death certificate
Just a proof of post rigamortum, that rancid smell of boredom
Known as oral seclorum

Underground forever, sinful bliss
Form your love made from us, thats infamous
No doubt, but with a strange new twist
Let your whole mind frame rearrange to this
Underground forever, sinful bliss
Form your love made from us, thats infamous
No doubt, but with a strange new twist
Let your whole mind frame rearrange to this

[Verse 3: Mad Child]
Bone cracking excitement, spine tingling temper
Seven dead bodies found stuffed in a camper
Wonderful whurl hatched from hell as an infant
Plush lust for liveforce left a permanent imprint
Sinful bliss, this disturbing behavior
Mad's mental ensalvement, a savages savior
Wave your hands in the hair like i know that you just
Dont care about the psycho that gets strapped in his room
Gazing out the window, i can't see though the grid
I got strapped to my chair cuz i flipped my lid
Breathing walls, flashback to spiders and skulls
Lights dim, grim reeper decided to call
But i had to take a message cuz it wasn't my time
The light at the end of the tunnell has yet to shine

Underground forever, sinful bliss
Form your love made from us, thats infamous
No doubt, but with a strange new twist
Let your whole mind frame rearrange to this
Underground forever, sinful bliss
Form your love made from us, thats infamous
No doubt, but with a strange new twist
Let your whole mind frame rearrange to this
