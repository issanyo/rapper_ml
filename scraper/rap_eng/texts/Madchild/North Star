[Hook]
This is going to freak you out
When Swollen comes back out
Shit that we speak about
The Members won’t back down

[Verse 1] Madchild
Wanna fuck? I’m the last man on Earth and your stranded on an island
The inmates are runnin’ the asylum
Don’t deal for weakness, a frequent sequence
Verses with personal substance bursting
Mom says I’m an intense person..
I guess that explains the nosebleeds and constant cursing
This is not the album signed to Virgin
It’s the unwanted haunted monster version
I’m the first in line to finish you off
I’ve been in a loft continuing thoughts of innocence lost
Now you can love us again
Put my blood brothers above others, I’m troublesome, man
Mind shattering, I’m adamant about you being mad at me
Battleaxe academy of assault and battery
You can have my vanity pack
I want my lifelong adding the abnormality back

[Hook]
This is going to freak you out
When Swollen comes back out
Shit that we speak about
The Members won’t back down

Just put your trust in us
And watch what we discuss
When Swollen comes back out
It’s going to freak you out

[Verse 2] Moka Only
Whenever Moka grip a pencil shits hit potential
Me and the instrumental got a thing going on
I’m abstract but I sting, scorpion
My impact tackles you so far beyond
That’s what’s up
You cats ain’t catching up
I’m bar stalling, I’m warning y’all to back shit up
Take your whole style, smash it up
You had your chance now you have to go and pass it up
My advance is why she dancing why the fans keep asking for some more of that grab you by the pantsy action
I’m intending to bend reality
I ain’t gotta do it with a friendly melody
This ain’t castles in the sky
More like the splash of tabasco in the eye
We drastically apply pressure, intensified measures
National treasure, smashing for pleasure

[Hook]
This is going to freak you out
When Swollen comes back out
Shit that we speak about
The Members won’t back down

Just put your trust in us
And watch what we discuss
When Swollen comes back out
It’s going to freak you out

[Verse 3] Prevail
The sparks from my battleaxe dragging on the ground
Is the only sight you see when the dragon makes his rounds
You squirming like maggots in a pound of ground beef
You might not like what I found when I dug down deep
Took a walk down Drug Street through Alcohol Lane
Now I’m back on the corner to sell it to y’all again
Changing like Ozzy, walking afraid
Cowards rocking more white stripes than Jack and Meg
Back in Black like Angus and Malcolm
The envelope, please let me tell you the outcome
Here we stand as a collective
Keep it in perspective, four times as effective
Connective tissues and nerves
Severed severely whenever I serve
Whoever deserves the words of the cursed
I’m reversed, don’t say I didn’t warn you first

[Hook]
This is going to freak you out
When Swollen comes back out
Shit that we speak about
The Members won’t back down

Just put your trust in us
And watch what we discuss
When Swollen comes back out
It’s going to freak you out
