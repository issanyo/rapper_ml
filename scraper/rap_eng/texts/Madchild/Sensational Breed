[Hook] Son Doobie
We steppin' out, don't have me pull the weapon out
Get it out, where you at?
What you reppin' now?
Up in the club my thugs, better let em out
Battle Axe rocks the set
Son, Check it out!
Wait, don't stop rockin', neck poppin'
We got the club hostage
Block on lock, shockin' topics
Can't stop it, got ya head knockin'

[Verse 1] Prevail
Yo
Static, distortion, and ambient noise
The champion's close, you can tell by the ambulance voice
Someone's about to bleed, the sensation of speed
The sensational breed
From the secret society, conspiracy of shadows
Purity of darkness, and legacy of castles
Move from the spark for the fire engulfs
Check your pulse, the impulse of werewolves
Drag the body back into the woods
Detach the back and tear into the goods
Tossed on the heap like metal scraps
Enter the sandman, speed metal and rap
Take advantage, your average rappers can't
Too many temples, imagine that
BPM's of a Mack-10, cadence of an automatic
My amazing performance will take it when you thought you had it

[Hook] Son Doobie
We steppin' out, don't have me pull the weapon out
Get it out, where you at?
What you reppin' now?
Up in the club my thugs, better let em out
Battle Axe rocks the set
Son, Check it out!
Wait, don't stop rockin', neck poppin'
We got the club hostage
Block on lock, shockin' topics
Can't stop it, got ya head knockin'


[Verse 2] Moka Only
Got heat? I bet you get warm
I'm an electric storm. Anything except the norm
You're entering restricted regions
Fit to be evicted by my strict allegiance
My team people be mean people
We've been lethal since the beginning up to the Bad Dreams sequel
Grab the green, I got the label to thank
I'm caffeinated, laughing all the way to the bank
I'm fascinated how you react to the fame
We came, we saw, we conquered, the Members remain
To be the ultimatum that made 'em afraid of the game
And laid 'em to rest, the recipe that made us a name
Cave in your chest, I'm wired, I'm unable to rest
Send your top gun man, we disable the best
I'm liable to burst and combust with no discussion
Head rush, we trust, you get left with nothin'!

[Hook] Son Doobie
We steppin' out, don't have me pull the weapon out
Get it out, where you at?
What you reppin' now?
Up in the club my thugs, better let em out
Battle Axe rocks the set
Son, Check it out!
Wait, don't stop rockin', neck poppin'
We got the club hostage
Block on lock, shockin' topics
Can't stop it, got ya head knockin'
Caution

[Verse 3] Madchild
Quit nitpickin' and flossin'
I'm shit pickin' this track, my mind's a mosh pit
Blood drops drip from copper faucets
Sick thoughts race through my mind, I'm exhausted
You hang loose, I'll hang ten
Full of venom and adrenaline, a man among men
Contaminate your vacant brain with blinding migraines
You'll find I'm not sane, you'll find I'm not fain
I reign terror, an unbearable arrogant character
Comparable to terrible experiments
69 Fastback can't pass me, Black Mustang
Cobra bitch, I'm nasty!
I'm uncommon, dominant and erotic
Control freak speaks
You wanted it? You got it
Not a lot of competition for a complicated personality
Cause I ain't livin' in reality

[Hook] Son Doobie
We steppin' out, don't have me pull the weapon out
Get it out, where you at?
What you reppin' now?
Up in the club my thugs, better let em out
Battle Axe rocks the set
Son, Check it out!
Wait, don't stop rockin', neck poppin'
We got the club hostage
Block on lock, shockin' topics
Can't stop it, got ya head knockin'
