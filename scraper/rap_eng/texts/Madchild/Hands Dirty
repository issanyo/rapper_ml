[Hook]
It's hard not to get my hands dirty (But I do it with good intention)
Society staring me like I'm not worthy (But they pay close attention)
It's hard not to get my hands dirty (I know I come with good intention)
I know they notice me (They just keep on pretendin')

[Verse 1: Madchild]
Yo, I'm good at marketing, very good at bargaining
Some people think my hands are dirty like I'm gardening
Didn't make a good deal, why don't you cry about it
That's fine, but why you gotta go and lie about it
Think people care about me, fuck no
So I'm a barber shop razor, I'm cut throat
Ice cold at making business deals
Here forever
I know how Walt Disney feels
Well known, I lived on both sides of the fence
You can say it was exciting, more than slightly intense
Thank God I had my music, to keep me out of some trouble
Still took some crazy shit like a stunt double
Finally the beast is calm
Still sharp, still fierce, still greasy palms
Yeah, sun and palm trees, rainfall and pinecones
Flying drone, way above your head, get your mind blown

[Hook]
It's hard not to get my hands dirty (But I do it with good intention)
Society staring me like I'm not worthy (But they pay close attention)
It's hard not to get my hands dirty (I know I come with good intention)
I know they notice me (They just keep on pretendin')

[Verse 2: Joseph Rose]
How the fuck do I make it when life is so expensive
And I've only been gettin' a small percentage
Seeing everyone around me with it was incentive
I had to realize that my ego was preventive
I wanna be remembered for doing something inventive
Yeah, something authentic and genuine
I'mma stand out for all the ladies and gentlemen that
Mind their own business and keep on peddling
Some people are fucked up, you gotta pay attention
And not to mention all the creepers causing weird tension
Making women feel unsafe when they're out to walk
It's fucking sick thinking they can get raped at the park
I can't even send my daughter and wife off the block
Without a kershaw blade and some pepper spray
Sick motherfuckers picking on victims to prey
Touch mine and get dropped in an ocean wave

[Hook]
It's hard not to get my hands dirty (But I do it with good intention)
Society staring me like I'm not worthy (But they pay close attention)
It's hard not to get my hands dirty (I know I come with good intention)
I know they notice me (They just keep on pretendin')

[Verse 3: Madchild]
Ok, I'm guilty, I'm living real nasty and filthy
Did too much dirt that the shit almost killed me
They say I can't fight and go on much farther
But I'm fighting and I'm winning like I'm Shaun MacArthur
Sometimes I think of my past, and I start to panic
My hands are dirty and grungier than a car mechanic
I need some Arm and Hammer
I've been known for harmful manner
Coming with the hardest grammar
They think that I start the drama
Heat breather to elite leader
Sharper than a meat cleaver, I don't like him
Me neither, he's meeker
They must've come up with a hundred names
But I'll keep snapping like I'm poor and having hunger pains
I start spearing for real, and it's a murder spree
Don't need to haunt me, comers coming for your dirty deeds
Killing it while making a killing, a corporate scorpion
End your pain, doctor of death, I'm Jack Kevorkian

[Hook]
It's hard not to get my hands dirty
Society making me like I'm not worthy
It's hard not to get my hands dirty
I know they notice me

[Hook]
It's hard not to get my hands dirty (But I do it with good intention)
Society staring me like I'm not worthy (But they pay close attention)
It's hard not to get my hands dirty (I know I come with good intention)
I know they notice me (They just keep on pretendin')
