[Verse 1] Prevail
No one’s impervious to the furnace
The burns, whoever’s turning is the three-ring circus
I’m holding my hands, the healing powers of Helios
The reconstruction of the double helix never seemed so close
Iridescent opalescent, translucent transcendence of extremity intensified by music
Group strength, primal urge
The planets are aligned, we can finally emerge
Punish the pride for the arrogant, exhausted and wretched
Hysterical, inferior, aggressive
Maximum carnage, adamantium cartilage
Abolish them and make them pay homage for all this common garbage
I hit like nerve gas, fast and precise
The body will decompose unless you pack it on ice
Second sight, prevision and telepathy
Witches covens, plus indulging chemistry

[Hook] Raaka Iriscience
Oh
The bars, the chains, the cage is cold
The heart, the pain, the rage explodes
The spark, the flame, the place just blows
(Breathtaking with the global effect)

Oh
The bars, the chains, the cage is cold
The heart, the pain, the rage explodes
The spark, the flame, the place just blows
(Breathtaking with the global effect)

[Verse 2] Madchild
Do not cross this awful thought process
Deep discussion of repercussion, exhaust all option
Bang nail in to coffin
Born, torn apart, reborn, strike often
Disturbing behaviour. Madchild’ll saviour
Never thought your killer was your next door neighbour
Chrome dipped poems now partially tarnished
Fight back
Might come back brightly armoured
Slightly alarming, perfect storm forming
Observe this abnormal performance
(Breath taking with the global effect)
Vampire, transpire, man, I go for the neck
New freedom, my shell is housing a genius
Response, I’ve never seen this
Gone far beyond the ambiance you used to
Bolted to a [?] state, I won’t lose you

[Hook] Raaka Iriscience
Oh
The bars, the chains, the cage is cold
The heart, the pain, the rage explodes
The spark, the flame, the place just blows
(Breathtaking with the global effect)

Oh
The bars, the chains, the cage is cold
The heart, the pain, the rage explodes
The spark, the flame, the place just blows
(Breathtaking with the global effect)

[Verse 3]
[Madchild]
Bass master, spit with the savage tongue
While you talk about shit that you haven’t done
Ok, I got it, Everyone’s promoting power and wealth
How ‘bout respect, strength, honour, love, loyalty, help?
Yeah I got guns but keep ‘em in the low for protection
Seeking a piece, I just need some direction
Stacked a mil, bought chains and rings
But what good are all these things if you ain’t right within?

[Prevail]
We in the eye of the storm when the dust settles
You’ll see it ain’t about [?] gems and precious metals
It’s a new era. The rebirth of iron and stone
You’re running with the crowd but afraid of dying alone
There’s only so much time on this rotating rock
What kind of life are you leading? Where you going when it stops?
It’s lonely at the top when you’re driven by consumption
And living in a prison of emotional destruction
(Breath taking with the global effect)

[Hook] Raaka Iriscience
Oh
The bars, the chains, the cage is cold
The heart, the pain, the rage explodes
The spark, the flame, the place just blows
(Breathtaking with the global effect)

Oh
The bars, the chains, the cage is cold
The heart, the pain, the rage explodes
The spark, the flame, the place just blows
(Breathtaking with the global effect)
