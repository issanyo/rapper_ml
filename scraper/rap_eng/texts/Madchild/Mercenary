[Intro]
There must be a way. The Viking found one

Melodic, hypnotic productions. Prevail
Autobiographic, it becomes classic
Identity: Peter Parker. Spiderman

[Verse 1: Prevail]
Web fluid substance help me stick to the mortar brick
Half-mortal portraits make a poor man rich
From the ditch to the foxhole, use a skeleton key
For what you can't see through the eye-hole, it's like 1408.
Live life altered state
Hydroplane interstate
We construct, we conduct, like an orchestra pit
But more focused and shit
Cut competition like orchids in the Little Shop of Horrors
I riddle rappers with the recoil, cause I can spit with force
Rip up blunts like it was ricochet, pick my prey
Use my primal instinct 'til they slip away
Purgatory's gray, Hell is dark, Heaven's white and gold
Now you try your best to leave your mark before it all unfolds
Eyes will be forever closed
Families stand on cemetery rows, carry a dozen rose
Bury you with bulldozers
Grass grows around you and no one ever gonna know
What you thought you'd amount to
The cleaver's too clever for the reaver to renounce you

[Interlude]
Madchild: The Silver Surfer
Fighting with good and evil
Give you nightmares
Now into the labyrinth of Madchild's music

[Verse 2: Madchild]
Yeah, now that I'm straight edge, I'm sharper than a straight edge
Reminiscent of the B-Boy Summit with a shaved head
My form, breathing like a firestorm
Tweeting on my iPhone, Monster in my Styrofoam
Teamwork makes the dream work, first it seemed worse
Now the situation you're about to see the seams burst
It's explosive, I'm so full of emotion
I can't help but be a bit ferocious
Approach us, I'm focused
The joke is that we are now the brokest
Richer than we've ever been, we swarm like the locust
Every verse I spit is catapulted into outer space
Every line's a shot of Mace, feeling like I'm out of place
Pretty boy to a fucking man with a rough face
Touch base with a nutcase in a tough place
Suck face with a rattlesnake, wrestle alligators
Bear fightin', I'm a rare Titan and a gladiator
Very influential for those who have potential
I'm mental, nothing that I do is accidental
Now that I'm back we've got our people now they're praying for us
Without commitment, we in trouble like the rain forest
