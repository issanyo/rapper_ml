[Verse One:  Prevail]
For the love of it all, I suffered the fall
From golden halls to closed in walls
Foes and those clothed in shawls
With eyes that glow, defy the crow
My ancient interpretation’s a show
A convict on Diamond Row
The field of ice heals the laboratory mice
Physically cylinder breaks won’t suffice
The compact zone reforms your whole life
Oracles that boost the concept of the ice
We only dwell among those that wave the fire sign
Engravings in caves are what turn those men blind
It’s a line, between what you believe and what you feel
The suckas never talk because we cut their guts with steel
I stay away from those, I play until the breaker blows
It’s your fate to have to take your breath in intervals
The great and invincible, we instate the critical
Old work and new work, congress and citadel
It will kill more people than they expect
Because blood and revolt go hand in neck
And that’s the truth

[Chorus]
We could get torn from limb to limb
We could get torn from limb to limb
Man, you crazy, thinking you can faze me
[Crosstalk:  Oh, Yo]
We could get torn from limb to limb
[Crosstalk:  Yo man, you fucking wild’n out]
Man, you crazy, thinking you can faze me
[Crosstalk]

[Verse Two:  Mad Child]
Fuck that little kid in the front row when I was on stage
Talking about let’s hear Mad Child start freestyling
And fuck them kids from the island
Just ‘cuz I was drunk outside of a club
Arguing with my ex-girlfriend, straight fucking wild’n
Why you think they call me Mad Child, ‘cuz I’m always smiling
I’m a violent sentence stylist, still bred to annihilate
Backpack and a bus pass to give you the right to violate
I already did that shit, shoplifting for kicks
Bombing, tagging with my friends back in 1986
But one day we all new we wanted and brand new Mercedes and shit
Didn’t talk amongst ourselves like a bunch of young ladies with dicks
Don’t try to tell me nothing about, Hip-Hop and virtues
Rock Steady representative, you’ve just entered the circle
Of underground kings that could hurt you, (break it down)
‘Cuz you worthless, you bitches serve no purpose
Talk behind my back, but when I’m ‘round it makes you nervous (fuck that)
‘Cuz I grew up with gangsters, drug lords and curb surfers
And still kept depth and substance in my verses
Say one more fucking word I guarantee i’ll take this further

[Chorus Fade Out]
We could get torn from limb to limb
We could get torn from limb to limb
Man, you crazy, thinking you can faze me
We could get torn from limb to limb
