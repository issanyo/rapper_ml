[Verse 1: Prevail]
Ever heard of vertigo? Well ain't no way else to go
Prevail knows the faculties of poison lay you vertical
It's only murder for every small animal committed
The only difference is I won't admit I did it
There's a limit as to how far my posse's willing to bend
The dawn of a burgundy Autumn blinds the minds of most men
Vomiting from the quarantine, praying for the end
You can tell by the stench that the venom's setting in
On the plane in which you reign, it's classified as "Do or die"
But in the realm in which we dwell, it's "Puncture necks and multiply"
Imagine the madness: the return of the Jew from Nazareth
The hunter and the hunted, the colonized and the savages
The only challenge is, did they bring enough to dirt to bury us?
Be aware, I hunt with the daughters of Cerebus
Where we're going, don't stress, there'll be plenty of time to rest
Close the curtains, brace your sternum, this is just a contest

[Hook: Arabic singing]

[Verse 2: Mad Child]
The ultimate experience: I've already felt it
Mad Child tasting her tongue, his heart melts
With the second chance, for this demon that she dealt with
Few and far between from beauty and the beast
To a perfect combination, once this passion is unleashed
Golden Angel, precious princess and since
This is more than just lust, trust if not now, then soon
One love, we'll have our chance to dance on the moon
Now the feel the trance of this goddess, vicious vibrations
Lap-dances, venomous serpents of temptation
Awkward balance, scars on my back from her talons
An evil evening, drinking blood by the gallons
Drenched, venting tension, adrenaline rush
Pain stains the carpet when you run into us
An effortless task, cold hearts and iron masks
Nightmares have been implanted that you shouldn't try and grasp

[Hook Arabic singing]

[Verse 3: Prevail & Mad Child]
Come stand amongst us, just don't ask us who brung us
There's one of them amongst us
Come on, you can trust us
We're the league that serves the justice: we're the confident ones
Come run amongst us and conquer someone
Some come to seek honor
Some seek to wreak havoc
Either you do or don't have it
If we speak, it's tragic
When the sun rises, are you surprised that I'm a beast?
Leatherface withers, cracks, and starts to crease
Feel your heart rate decrease, the unveiling of the vein
White widow, crystal palace, champagne, who calls them strange?
And down here it's the strangest thing
Flaming skies start to fall
My jaws of life, the cause of death, my breath swing a wrecking ball
This is your beckoning call
While we're checking you all
All praise the circuit breaker that circulates through your walls
And appalls all who call
I brawl, maul, and maim
We bless and destroy with strength still out of range

[Hook Arabic singing]
