[Intro]
The adventures of Super Beast!

[Verse 1]
Yo-
I walk into a room and many man will die
Don't care if there's twenty men inside, it's total genocide (ching)
I'm a Battle Lord equipped with lethal weaponry (click)
I'm a Super Beast and that's my secret recipe
I remember when I used to rock the H train
I had the dragon by the tail, fucking weight gain
I hit a rapper like a motherfucking freight train (air horn)
First prize blue nose Pit fucking a Great Dane
Yeah I'm murdering you bastards, dirty little rascals
I'm hurting you, I guarantee I'm flirting with disaster
Now I don't give a fuck about a party in the street
Cause I'm a modern oddity that's bodying a beat
Coagulate with Dracula, stab you in the orifice (splat)
Darker than a horror flick, sharper than a swordfish
Lonely like an orphan on morphine, I'm warping, I'm morphing (scream)
I will rip apart your ligaments
Finish off a rapper like a cigarette
Smoke him then I'll rip his spinal cord and eat that shit like it was licorice
That's a bad predicament
Guarantee I leave a rapper with a gross disfigurement
You could say I'm rigorous
Lyrically I throw a couple body blows in audio
Young Mike Tyson, I'm a rotty with a snotty nose
Crack in you in the head (Pow!), I'm back from the dead
I'm murdering this track with an axe, I see red

[Hook]
Overlord of rap, I'm the underground king
Mad Child, you don't wanna fuck with me boy
Mad Child, Mad Child
I'm the misguided angel
Overlord of rap, I'm the underground king
Mad Child, you don't wanna fuck with me boy
Mad Child, Mad Child
I'm the misguided angel

[Verse 2]
My tongue's a C4 explosive (boom)
Watch for my saliva cause it's acid and corrosive
Rapping like a massive and ferocious
Nasty little motherfucking bastard, I'm atrocious
Click, click, Pow! My tongue's a grenade launcher
You should be afraid because I'm dumb, my brigade's bonkers
Standing like a gargoyle, chalk on grey
Did so many drugs my brain's now a hardboiled egg
I fill my brain with ammunition 'till I go to bed
Wake up as a weapon, fully automatic loaded head (click)
You're spider's tingling, carnivorous delivery
Blood is fucking boiling, I am sizzling with misery
I'll keep injecting poison venom 'till your head's numb
Then smash through your bedroom door and yell "Redrum"
Cobra with a silver tongue, I've been numb
Overlord going over board and then some
Mentality is priceless with challenging vices
Mister Schizophrenic Personality Crisis
Beauty and the Beast, I will never divorce her
Rebellious sorcerer, with devilish torture

[Hook]

[Outro]
