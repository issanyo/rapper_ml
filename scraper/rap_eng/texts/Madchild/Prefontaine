[Intro]
Yo, yo

[Chorus]
I’m going Prefontaine on you hoes
Mad dope like putting cocaine up your nose, yeah
Those that oppose get slain I suppose, yeah
Mad Child spit acid rain on you hoes
Gladiator on the battle break
You’re better off french-kissing with a rattlesnake
Fuck with Mad Child, that’ll be a bad mistake
Tell me, how much torture can a little fucking savage take?

[Verse 1]
I’ll go fishing and I catch a fucking rapper like a manta ray
Then slice his motherfucking throat with a katana blade
Rappers bugging me, I turn into a can of Raid
You are not a candidate, eat you like a candy cane
Veins are full of antifreeze, call me Candy Man
Three times, holding tools like I’m a fucking handyman
Rhymes are sweet, get delivered like a candy-gram
Fuck these pussy rappers up like porno on a handycam
I’m the Lawnmower Man, powerfully electric with an ongoing plan
I was crazy now a calm lowly man, yeah right, I’m a lunatic with bombs blowing land

[Chorus]
I’m going Prefontaine on you hoes
Mad dope like putting cocaine up your nose, yeah
Those that oppose get slain I suppose, yeah
Mad Child spit acid rain on you hoes
Gladiator on the battle break
You’re better off french-kissing with a rattlesnake
Fuck with Mad Child, that’ll be a bad mistake
Tell me, how much torture can a little fucking savage take?

[Verse 2]
Won’t hear me complain, I am free from pain
I am running fucking shit like Prefontaine
Words spreading like they’re viral, now watch them spiral
Right into your brain until they break right through your firewall
You can see the fire in my eyeballs scaring all my rivals
Straightedge bitch, fuck a highball
You get kiboshed, I’m a cyborg
I’m a cyclops, I’m a rhyme lord
I don’t mind cops just as long as they’re cool
? find props mystical a werewolf
Spitting like I’ve written everyday since I have been born
Rocking diamond clothing, buying furniture from Inform

[Chorus]
I’m going Prefontaine on you hoes
Mad dope like putting cocaine up your nose, yeah
Those that oppose get slain I suppose, yeah
Mad Child spit acid rain on you hoes
Gladiator on the battle break
You’re better off french-kissing with a rattlesnake
Fuck with Mad Child, that’ll be a bad mistake
Tell me, how much torture can a little fucking savage take?

[Verse 3]
Very charismatic addict, I’m a ruined idol
Last year even my demo sounded suicidal
This year spitting venom I’m a subhuman
Walking down the street I hear my song in cars with subs booming
Regurgitating rhymes like I am gargling
Everybody knows that I am dope, there is no arguing
Spitting sparklers, no rappers targeting
Don’t have to cause I marvellously raps like I am carpeting
I drink Monster, I rock Diamond
I rock RDS, I love rhyming
I cause problems, they know I’m raising hell
Now I got em worried like Carlito on the Jezebel

[Chorus]
I’m going Prefontaine on you hoes
Mad dope like putting cocaine up your nose, yeah
Those that oppose get slain I suppose, yeah
Mad Child spit acid rain on you hoes
Gladiator on the battle break
You’re better off french-kissing with a rattlesnake
Fuck with Mad Child, that’ll be a bad mistake
Tell me, how much torture can a little fucking savage take?
