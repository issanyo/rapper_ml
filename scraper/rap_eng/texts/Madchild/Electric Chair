[scratched]
It's crazy, what's crazy?
It's crazy, what's crazy?
He's crazy, what's crazy?
You guys are crazy?
What's crazy?

[Prevail]
I keep my mind real sharp like a dagger mouth
You got beef, I cut two chops for T-Bone and the porterhouse
Order that and pick it up
Stick a knife, defend your guts
Ribs
Before you grab some paper plates and plastic cups
Pass the napkins, Pass the Aspirin
I'm getting a headache
But that shit will only get inside of my head if I let it!
I spread it up and slowed it down
We played it backwards
(Devil voice)
When the reverend sent you up to heaven, use my name as reference
Amen!
With good intentions my inventions meant to help the planet!
My occupation's devastation that's my only talent!
I burn the building, smell the granite and then I crashed the cars
I hear the copes coming, someone must have tipped them off!
Prevail points supremacy
Bones quest destiny
I'm just like the master thief! (That's right)
Brought you out of Paris
Fucked up body washed up on the Spanish beach!

I will
Grow stronger 'till I possess my full power
From the bottom of swamp to a tall tower!
I killed all vowels you were all cowards
I'm the light shine bright, white night owl
Sacrifice my life, sharpen my knife
Every day grey and even darker at night!
Now I'm dagger mouth, nothing to brag about
I go back ten years and let the dragon out
Colossal elemental beast
Heavy metal piece, creep like a centipede
Speak like a pretender
Dig really deep of destroyed enemies
Tell the underground that the reaper is back
Carved out, hollow knife
Deep in my back
Woundsâ€¦ torn fake friendships
Work out
Drink revenge, eat vengeance
You better pay attention
I'm a slain henchmen
Demigod, motel 6, no mini bar
No credit card, I can't even get a rent car

[scratched]
I keep my mind real sharp like a dagger mouth
Live from the Planet Earth
Tell the underground that the reaper is back
Prevail loads the supremacy
My mind real sharp like
I'm a slain henchmen
I'm dagger mouth
I go back ten years and let the dragon out

[Prevail]
Locomotive train vessel
Crushing all your blood vessels
Rushing through your brain cells
Faint like a cable car
Live from the Planet Earth
Sun's an unstable star
Still 10 billion to go
Yo, a couple months to go
I spent a grip down on south hill row
Nothing like a tailor made suit
Army down the waist
Take a case on the booth
Take the recruits
Sniper take the case on the roof
Time to pay the piper
Be hasty to shoot

[Mad Child]
I can feel the cops watching, taken taken photographs
Captain like 15
Running game like a quarterback going 40 back
Now I'm more than that
Sorta scary because I am very more than ordinary
Looking into the mirror to just to
See what I am all about
Realize I have fallen hard
I am hollowed out
Boring day, blue pills on an orange tray
Nails fall off but the horns stay
All bad, things can get bit drastic
Do me wrong, I will dog fuck you and spit acid

[scratched]
I keep my mind real sharp like a dagger mouth
Live from the Planet Earth
Tell the underground that the reaper is back
Prevail loads the supremacy
My mind real sharp like
I'm a slain henchmen
I'm dagger mouth
I go back ten years and let the dragon out
