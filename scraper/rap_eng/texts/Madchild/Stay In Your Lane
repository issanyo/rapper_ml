[Verse 1: Swisha T]
Ayo
I’m heat seeking. These weak divas, with meat cleavers
If you need features, I speak either. The street sweeper
You don’t like my tracks? Ha! Well me neither
If Justin got locked you’d probably yell “free Bieber”
Mc’s eager, they keep asking the same questions
Like “check my lyrics Swish, I’ve been rapping since grade seven”
Don’t come at me like that ‘cause I’ve got an insane temper
Cannibal had a war with Hannibal and I ate Lecter
Your wifey swallowed my kids and told me they taste better
Blew inside her mouth like Osama did to the trade center
You’ll never get on my level because it takes effort
All you rappers pussies, we isn’t even the same gender
I used to pop a lot of pills and hang with prostitutes
Or run around my city in a fat bastard body suit
I made chicken strips and bacon on a Honda Coupe
Film a fucking porno with your mama, make your father shoot


[Hook]
Bitch, stay in your lane
(Feed the beast, a demon, it’s being re-released)
Bitch, stay in your lane
(I’m that crazy mothafucka with a bomb on his chest)
Bitch, stay in your lane
(Cannibal had a war with Hannibal and I ate Lecter)
Bitch, stay in your lane

(I’ll fist fuck a pregnant bitch and yank out the fetus)


[Verse 2: Johnny Bravo]

Now I’m that crazy mothafucka with a bomb on his chest
Carving your flesh, shit, looks like I’m causing a threat
I swallow broken bottles, catching hollows in my teeth
So it’s natural, dirty bastard. Play it on repeat
Shit. I’m the sourest daddy, devouring planets
I’ll make the whole galaxy vanish
My power turn a grown man coward and passive
Shower in your blood and snort a line of your ashes
Spitting shitty writtens, listen, no one remembers
My vocals are better. I’m never going to fold under pressure
I’m spitting coka like the mothafucking snow in December
So take a dose of my medication and go on a bender
Tell her once I reach the gates of heaven, I will spread the aids infection
Take their weapons, break the world record for the greatest legend
Check the facts, yeah, the records will show
Got the body of a Greek God who let himself go


[Hook]
Bitch, stay in your lane
(Feed the beast, a demon, it’s being re-released)
Bitch, stay in your lane
(I’m that crazy mothafucka with a bomb on his chest)
Bitch, stay in your lane
(Cannibal had a war with Hannibal and I ate Lecter)
Bitch, stay in your lane

(I’ll make a hobo lick my shit for some motherfucking spare change)


[Verse 3: Charron]

Using a dictionary for rollin’ paper. Toke it later
Write my verse mid-air in smoke and vapor
D-d-d-d-danger, make way for the local stranger
Giving you a swift tune-up like Taylor's vocal trainer
Capeesh, My bitch leave you dropped in the streets
I'll swing my dog on a leash until it knocks out your teeth
Feed the beast, a demon, it’s being re-released
I'll motherfucking leave a priest hangin' by a Jesus piece
With some foreign bitches pimpin' in the laying game
And i'm nause and i'm sure that we could run the crazy train
Hit it then i'm splitting, I don't even want to say my name
Vanishing like David Blaine up on a Malaysian plane
Make cake, it's a wordplay vandal
Burn your grandmas face with her birthday candles
Check the replay on SportsCenter
Bench press a midget and toss him, I've got a short temper


[Hook]
Bitch, stay in your lane
(Feed the beast, a demon, it’s being re-released)
Bitch, stay in your lane
(I’m that crazy mothafucka with a bomb on his chest)
Bitch, stay in your lane
(Cannibal had a war with Hannibal and I ate Lecter)
Bitch, stay in your lane

(I bought flowers for my mother and I told her I loved her)
