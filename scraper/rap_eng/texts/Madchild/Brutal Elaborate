[Intro]
I'm comin'. You ready? You better be
I'm comin' (I'm comin')
I'm comin'. You ready?

[Verse 1]

It goes
[?] chief talk to the white hot warlock
Rock dead volt now that your doors locked
Annihilate. Armed iron breaks
Instruments of mass destruction, ill take
Steel wheels vibrate through the black box
Smoke medicine, Galaga on the laptop
Warriors rain dance on your cash crop
Jackpot. Thoughts, skull and crossbones backdrop


[Hook]
I'm comin'. You ready? You better be
I'm comin'. You ready? You better be
Amphetamines, fluctuate steadily
Have to catch up to myself and get ahead of me


[Verse 2]

Madchild's a monster. The trains off the track
Wanna feel my pain? Paint a rainbow black
Devil ether, fire apple red
I get high, hope I fly when i'm dead
Fabulous disaster, no fun tomorrow
Let it rain, i'm insane, my brain recoil with horror
I'm coming like nobody's innocent
Leather face, your slowly diminishing


[Hook]
I'm comin'. You ready? You better be
I'm comin'. You ready? You better be
Amphetamines, fluctuate steadily
Have to catch up to myself to get ahead of me


[Verse 3]

Time withers me and cracks the skin
While i'm practicing subtracting acts of sin
Playground children of the night go deeper
Cause we all meet the Grim Reaper
I feel bad for all the things iv'e done
But i'ma live for ever if the good die young
What craft will I master after i'm done
Get stoned 'till the moon turn back to the sun
Let the pills speak with the knife in my teeth
Natural streak freak life that I lead
Multiply in an altered state
If we don't have faith there'll be hell to pay


[Hook 2]
If your my friend and your in pain just call
For every man a little rain must fall
Would you lend a helping hand when an angel calls?
If iv'e changed, still strange with a dangerous skull


[Verse 4]

Love god but there's still something wrong with my heart
Cause I look towards the light but i'm strong when it's dark
Ask yourself a question, alone in the park
Are you a dog or a lion or a snake or a shark
Me? I had to take my life and then break it apart
With the strength to take a business and make it an art
And now my pockets are a little bit lighter
But I wake up in the morning and the sunshine brighter
Now you could stay if you play to my vanity
But we can leave if you plead to insanity
Heaven for the vampire, stare at the sunset
Seven-teen pills on a hill, having fun yet?


[Hook]
I'm comin'. You ready? You better be
I'm comin'. You ready? You better be
Amphetamines, fluctuate steadily
Have to catch up to myself to get ahead of me

[Hook 2]
If your my friend and your in pain just call
For every man a little rain must fall
Would you lend a helping hand when an angel calls?
If iv'e changed, still strange with a dangerous skull
