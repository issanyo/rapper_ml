[verse 1: MadChild]


Yo, master of disaster I'm an underground phenomenon
Naturally a bastard but the king of my conglomerate
Welcome to Armageddon rhymes I write 'em armour plated
Have a relationship with karma but it's complicated
Yes I am wicked I am known for being indubious
Words I choose will prove that I won't lose I'm an enthusiast
Pick any battle topic shit I spit is catastrophic
Once I explode unleashing shrapnel, sharpened metal objects
Take a look into these eyes you'll see exploding fire
Silver tongue with iron lungs but teeth look like corroding iron
Schizophrenic tenant plus a very lonely landlord, Rancor
Keep punching my head until my hands sore
There seems to be a reason that they keep me at a distance
I'm defiantly persistent there's evil in this infant
The afterlife is heaven but I am hellbent
My appetite for destruction is over whelming


[Chorus: MadChild]

Givem hell, one hundred rounds
Feeding like a hungry hound
In my head the thunder pounds
Hailing from the underground
I listen to a lot of rappers but I don't believem
Misguided angel I was spawned one of the coldest heathens

[Chorus: Trash Gordon]

Givem hell, huntem down
Fuckem let it buck and blaow
Body is a loveless shell
Permanently underground
I listen to a lot of rappers and they all bleedin
Trash Gordon I was raised to be a fuckin demon


[verse 2: Trash Gordon]

Ain't nothing to joke about you ain't got a hope in hell
Stomping on your chest until your broken ribs poking out
That dead weight that pulls you down
With a shred I hope you drown
Neck tie a rope around close your eyes it's over now
The black heart in my chest is pacing
Nothing in my head but satan
State of pure desolation, the mental patient
With a barrel to his temple embracing the death that waits him
Splittin domes and adding to my list of foes
Sick when my mental depicts it and then it just implodes
Smash a little ho and turn her count into a withered rose
That's where my sickness goes
Visions of your death I'm lifting up your best
Feel a sinkin in your chest
Swing a corked bat, leave you physically depressed
I'm a sociopath but that's the curse that I'm under
Every enemy get buried in the dirt by the hundreds
I'm like fuckin rain man when I murder by numbers


[Chorus]


[verse 3: Kuniva]

Who you know that jumps from a fire escape
And calls the victims phone and land on him as soon as it vibrates
They say I'm hard to get along with highly irate
Your girl takes so much dick from me I should just ball up and cry rape
You shouldn't even be here
You people stare a bodies through that cracked door keep it moving people there's nothing to see here
The same nigga from Devils Night
Keep it poppin like chains on a pedel bike
Throw your dame on a metal spike
And beat your puppy to death with a metal pipe
And shoot it out with the cops on site, that's on a mellow night
I bet you wonderin where D12 been at
On an 8 year binge of alcohol and crinack
Pullin guns on assholes like where the shit at
Niggas be all hype but some bullets makem chillax
I hop in the cab now, shoot at your cash cow
And brag about it to Madchild I'm that wild
