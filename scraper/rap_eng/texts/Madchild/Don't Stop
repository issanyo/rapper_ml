[Verse 1: Madchild]
Look into these eyeballs
You can see there's fireballs
Spitting fire like I'm a pyro from Hiro
Shocking like a stun gun, I'm in a conundrum
Walking through a dungeon, pale like I'm from London
Traveling, my brains unraveling, I'm coming undone
But still I'm heavy like a truck that's a one ton
I will eat you like a wonton, I'll smoke a rapper like a Pom Pom
Bamm-Bamm!
Draping up these rappers like a sodomite selector
Spinning around your head like I'm a satellite directed
Penetrating, I'm a hyperventilating alien
Probing you up in my UFO but I'm Canadian
Star Wars, pulling out my lightsaber, en garde!
Strong enough to pull the ears up off a Gunnar
Been around hip hop so long that I'm a monarch
Putting fat laces in my Pumas, wearing Conart
My rhyme will stick to you like lawn darts

[Hook: Slaine]
And you don't stop, and you don't quit
And you don't stop, and you don't quit
And you don't stop, and you don't quit
Me and Madchild, yeah we on our own shit

[Verse 2: Slaine]
And they say these kids are the craziest
The whole world's alive, but he's just what they say he is
Let's go back in time, back to where the eighties is
See the kid as he grew up and the ways he lived
I jerked off before the age of ten, found a page and pen
Passed it and laughed off the rage and sin
Hackin' cough, bad ideas in my brain dancing back and forth
I put the pen and page down, went back to jacking off
My morals all over the place, it's all over
Fall over drunk, I'm shit-faced, I never call sober
You know what my style on for now on
How long [??] The matador and it's now dawn
Bitches want a [??] while the pad is add on
The mirror with the razor out, now you want a pal, huh?
I'm sick of society, I can't function in it
I'll cuss you bitches out, go back to gettin' drunk again

[Hook: Slaine] x2
And you don't stop, and you don't quit
And you don't stop, and you don't quit
And you don't stop, and you don't quit
Me and Madchild, yeah we on our own shit

[Verse 3: Madchild]
Hit record, Jason Bourne, no replacement for him
Hallucinating, face is warm, drinking Agent Orange
When I was young I used to fuck and bring the cameras out
Riding wearing floral print pajamas at my grandma's house
I'm a blabbermouth, so much shit to rap about
I'll eat a rapper like an apple then I'll crap him out
This took all the energy that I could muster up
Cause mentally, my mind has warped into a clusterfuck
Subhuman, psychotic, I'm a superbeast
My girl is twenty three, don't want to slide around in cougar grease
Uhllaaah, I'm fly like I'm the Enterprise
Whipper-rapper dead, will not be able to identify 'em
I'll eat a rapper like it's dinner time
Cold like I'm a bicycle with icicles at winter time

[Hook: Slaine] x2
And you don't stop, and you don't quit
And you don't stop, and you don't quit
And you don't stop, and you don't quit
Me and Madchild, yeah we on our own shit
