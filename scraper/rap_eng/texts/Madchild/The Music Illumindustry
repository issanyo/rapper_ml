[Verse 1]
It’s you against the world with a state of low complex
Picture my self on stage with a camera, phone on set
Paying homage to every dog who’s high in the sky
Seeing green, the price voucher, dollar signs for me eyes
Been out of shape, that’s Rick Ross taking a number two
Strip the culture leaving hip-hop naked covered in bruises
Brainwashing us with MKUltra Shampoo
Speaking truth is [?] getting fired from Fox News
Racial profile to keep private prisons occupied better
You shaking when taking shots, dropping clips like Jive Records
Even behind closed doors it’ll leave the [?]
Images hidden in plain sight, this horror [?] currency
The sonic whispers of propaganda as above as below
We sacrifice the music to the blood of a goal
Rip out the tongue he speaks in and hand them these horns
Powered like Kanye between pillars [?] sword

[Hook] Madchild
Worst fear when I’m lying in my deathbed
Knowing this is something that I could’ve been the best at
Doesn’t matter if you guys don’t get it
What matters is that I do and where this is headed

I just need some time alone (please)
I just need some time at home
You got your life, I’m just trying to find my own (yeah)
I just need some time alone

[Verse 2] Madchild
To truly feel terrible inside is an emotion
Feel like I’m chained to the bottom of the ocean
Feeling drained as a product of devotion
The people that I feel I owe I’m too close with
I am lonely at times
What I really need most is the loneliest of times
Tired of your opinions, knowing what’s best for me
Deep inside already know the best recipe
Keep in mind you are not in my shoes
You don’t understand the concept of art and the moods that it takes to create and demonstrate greatness
The focus that it takes, you just debate statements
That I make and you role your eyes
There is only so much that I can hold inside
The role that you play is a lead in my life
But right now I don’t fucking need your advice

[Hook] Madchild
Worst fear when I’m lying in my deathbed
Knowing this is something that I could’ve been the best at
Doesn’t matter if you guys don’t get it
What matters is that I do and where this is headed

I just need some time alone (please)
I just need some time at home
You got your life, I’m just trying to find my own (yeah)
I just need some time alone

[Verse 3]
They come and shake your hand and say that you’re the man
They make you sign a contract and give you a hundred grand
They say that they’ll promote you and now you’ll be a star
You’re suck for succeeding son, your family will probably starve
The sixteen grand to spend on each CD
The six hundred and sixty six to spend personally
Five beats, features, cover art and merchandise
But what about promoting, oh you figured that you’re covered right?
Actually, due to stipulations, all they had to do was tell a couple contacts
Maybe make a Facebook page, for there another contact
Mean while still gotta move all these units
‘Cause you’re still liable for the sign-on bonus
Now everything’s become in hell to [?]
You’ll probably wind up living in a shelter
But if you’re lucky they’ll bring your messes to an altar

[Hook] Madchild
Worst fear when I’m lying in my deathbed
Knowing this is something that I could’ve been the best at
Doesn’t matter if you guys don’t get it
What matters is that I do and where this is headed

I just need some time alone (please)
I just need some time at home
You got your life, I’m just trying to find my own (yeah)
I just need some time alone

[Outro] Madchild
I appreciate everything you’ve done for me
I mean Everything you’ve done for me
I love you, but I need to follow my own heart right now
I know it’s best for me
I need to write, I need to record
I need to be by myself
I need to become the best artist I can be again
I’m getting pulled in too many directions
It ain’t like riding a bike, dawg
You don’t just get back on and be the fucking sharpest fiercest fucking motherfucker out there
It takes time
It takes practice
