[Madchild:]
One, two, three, four
Heart beat badly, poison blood stream, hate myself when no one loves me
I'm so ugly, drugs for days, friends concerned it's just a phase
I'm back to make maniac music, GHB and cocaine in my music
Crack stop complaining I'll lose it, jack tripper jack the ripper
Meet the reaper that's the kicker
Fire eater hammer thrower, ima cheater hardly know her
I ain't asking I can kick it, beat myself self inflicted
Come on someone want it, alone my house feels haunted
Just chill we smoke some chronic claustrophobic cabin fever
Said she loves me can't believe her

[Hook]
She tried to kill my art
She couldn't fill my heart
Still the start
Man with the loaded gun
She said I was the only one
Pops said I told ya son
Still fold me like you owe me one
Now she don't control me but no one hold me
Rock slowly the lonely one, I'm still the one

[Prevail:]
I'm nomadic we live on the tour bus
A tragic sickness and nothing can cure us
Even if there was a vaccine I'm addicted like caffeine to back stage rap scenes
VIP lounges, mic checks, laminates, dress control stamina
Fan favorite candidates, the planets going to spin off its axis
The plan is in motion, my devotion all access, practice makes perfect
Back to crack surface, makes tracks to purchase, black magic merchants
Searching the world for a group like this, I can say with confidence not another exists
If they do they're through, razor blades no rules, I'm raised old school
This town ain't big enough for two, it's a showdown at sunset
Prev one's a sure bet, riding with the lonely guns we ain't done yet

[Hook:]
She tried to kill my art
She couldn't fill my heart
Still the start
Man with the loaded gun
She said I was the only one
Pops said I told ya son
Still fold me like you owe me one
Now she don't control me but no one hold me
Rock slowly the lonely one, I'm still the one

[Prevail:]
Destructive danger, let's face the demolition, one case of dynamite don't waste ammunition
Now that's ambition, a well planned assault, we paint a vision of incredible original art

(That's right)

[Madchild:]
Marvelous creature, beautifully builded abusive music, unsuitable for children
I throw thunder from the throne, bright lights spark dark undertones

[Prevail:]
Beyond thunderdome, fight like mad max, strike with the battleaxe
The road warrior's back, we stacks furious facts, the notorious raps
The legacy continues and the story will last

[Hook:]
She tried to kill my art
She couldn't fill my heart
Still the start
Man with the loaded gun
She said I was the only one
Pops said I told ya son
Still fold me like you owe me one
Now she don't control me but no one hold me
Rock slowly the lonely one, I'm still the one
