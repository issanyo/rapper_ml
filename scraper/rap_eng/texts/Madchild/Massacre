Prevail:
Small pieces of metal get embedded in your skin
Asymmetrical trajectory as seen by Galileo
Ride the horse color pale, reminiscent of Rembrandt
Pyrokinesis, enjoy the taste of the kickback
Red forbidden planet, amulets that conjure souls
Doomed to float forever in the threshold of the crossroads
Crossed bones & skulls, palms with a pulse
The mouth of madness, arrangement orchestral
Celestial bodies undetected by the human eye
Reflected rays into the stratosphere whether its day or night
The folklore continues, delirium & mania
No available serum for victims of Transylvania

Madchild:
Stunned numbness Shane stand strongest
Things gone wrong and still drills the conquest
Mad from brain cell like bong hits
Thor's war hammer, I Donkey kong kids
Kiss the serpent some sense of purpose
Cross before the crown of the kingdom is worthless
You think I'm crazy when at first we meet
But the devil and his children walk with earthly feet
Abandonment issues, heart palpitations
Table for one, won't start conversations
Broke both hearts apart, I still hear her when she screams
I'm in the cracked mirror of her dreams
Truth deployment, regroup for youth enjoyment
Recoup from truth employment
Fire circles, spirits in the seance
Mental chaos, my mind's melting crayons

Prevail:
Ain't nothin guaranteed but death
Reach for the stars
Capture that moment worldwide
Going in for the kill right now
Don't waste your time

Ain't nothin guaranteed but death
Reach for the stars
Capture that moment worldwide
Swollen Members

Fathoms and fathoms of deep water the phantoms of speech
Alters the martyrs of modern-day lexicography
Archers and archers and stonecarvers with statues that seem larger
The fathers of promising new discology
Tables of gold made for sacrificial ceremonies
Primitive equipment, instruments from the conservatory
Infernal regions that burn when youre breathing
Internally melting, externally freezing

Madchild:
Cocoon crack open, consume black smoke
My platoon snaps skull and then chewing tobacco
Six feet deep, Madchild ashes on the mantle
Society attacks, show canceled
Handful of hatred, surrounded by candles and sacred
Heart pound profoundly I'm bakin'
(Come closer)
Control freak carnival, black crows in the sunset
I'm vulnerable

Prevail:
Ain't nothin' guaranteed but death
Reach for the stars
Capture that moment worldwide
