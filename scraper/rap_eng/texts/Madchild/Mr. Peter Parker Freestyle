Yeah, Mad Child from Swollen Members
Battleaxe Warriors, what up?

Mr. Peter Parker, I'm an evil adult
I'm fuckin' fly like Batman from the League of Shadows
I'm a harsh-speakin' heathen with a breathin' problem
I spit blue and yellow flames and then I'll eat a goblin
I'm The Incredible Hulk as far as these flows
But my body and face turn blue when I'm in beast mode
Now it's the calming of the beast
Uncommonly I'm rhymin' like I vomit up a feast
Jet Li, it's a problem now that I have been unleashed
I'm a giant riot, watch for flyin' iron in the streets
Last year, I was nothin' but a lyin' junkie
Trippin' on fuckin' pink elephants and flyin' monkeys
But now I'm back, I got the hunger of a great white
On the streets with a steak knife, yellin', "I hate life"
Mr. Peter Parker, nobody comin' darker than Mad Child
I rap like I am barkin' in an argument
Walkin' through a dark apartment armed with empty cartridges
And rip the hearts apart from rotten carcasses with Parkinson's
Yeah, it's The Last of the Mohicans
From traffickin' on weekends to laughin' in the deep end
Snot nose, laughin' from the acid while I'm peakin'
To poppin' 20 80's every day then I was freakin'

Compassion is a weakness that your enemies will not share
They don't care if you're screamin' that is not fair
A lot of rappers out full of hot air
Tryin' to be clever, yeah, but mentally they're not there
I was dealt a bad hand like a card player
Tryin' to embark upon a mission from a dark lair
A lot of rappers out full of hot air
Tryin' to be clever, yeah, but mentally they're not there

Mad Child, I am still killin'
And these are crooked comics from a comic book villain
I'm Canadian, don't think of us as foreign people
Cause we play hockey, wear tuques and drink Orange Pekoe
We are Battleaxe Warriors, there's no equal
I know kids that got more tools than Home Depot
I don't got a man purse or wear bar clothes
We don't not talk like the movie Fargo
I'm spittin' bars like the karate chop, quick to make a body drop
Leave so many dents you need a body shop
Actin' unappropriate from Tokyo to Van
Godzilla, breathin' fire when I'm in Tokyo, Japan
Proud to be Canadian, my brain made of titanium
My tongue slice sharper than the sword of an Arabian
Sharper than a vampire's fangs from Transylvania
Tryin' to start a craze like it was 80's Hulkamania
I spit venom, grown cobra, stoned soldier
Ice cold, I'm a snow blower with a cold shoulder
Not the quite ridiculous cause this is situation
Put me in the mental hostpital, I'll be the sickest patient
I'll leave these rappers for dinner without no reservation
Get it, the sickest patient? I need medication
