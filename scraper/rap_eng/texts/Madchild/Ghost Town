[Verse 1]

Dim lit candles, Mad spit fire and these misfits scramble
Mad get old skin tough like leather
While these young cream puffs scream stuff on twitter
Legendary tail of a dark stranger
It's a scary hell for a war angel
Look at everything from a dark angle
I'm a dull blade with a sharp handle
I love movies, hate computers
Have faith we could still create the future
Rusty nails, Dusty trails of a Ghost Town
Poppin' pills, buckin' rails, I'm the joke now? Had the purest raps. Lured into a tourist trap. Look at my reflection
In the mirror thinking "Who is That?" Pardon the expression. Beaten till i'm blue and black. Art is my aggression
Passion and I ruined that. Rattlesnake juice, poison in my veins. Sins iv'e committed for enjoyment i'm ashamed
Silver Surfer dance among the stars. Gliding through the galaxy Galaga and Jaws. Thor's war hammer, glamorize My flaws
Samurai at war, rippin', shreddin' like i'm Wolverine
But i'm Norrin Radd. I'm a silver beam. Unfaithful
Phantom of Lust
Enough pain in my heart to crush the planet to dust. The infinite will still consume. I'm a Prisoner of Doom, fumes fill my room
My tongues an engine block, I rattle off of the mouth
It's 4am and I'm still going off in my house

[Outro]

Braveheart, I'm proud of ya
