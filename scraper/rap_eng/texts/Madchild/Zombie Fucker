[Intro: Madchild]
Yeah
Shout out to the homie, Tolchock Maltijik, from Sweden
Check out the Swedish version we got of this song in this video
It's underground Hip-Hop world wide bitch
We run this shit, BAX WAR

[Verse 1: Madchild]
I am not that bored
Break into your house like Clockwork Orange
I'm a little devil with these heavenly horns
Raid your fridge and then I'll wack off to some 70's porn
I'm coming back to do this shit like never before
And I fuck a batch of bitches still whenever we tour
Fuck yes, success the best revenge
Me and God and rap and money are the best of friends
I'm a silver tongue devil, in a silver Benz
Making songs for young rebels that don't trust the trends
Fuck fifteen minutes of fame. In it to win it
Demented lieutenant has entered your brain
I will not come out, now you're stuck with me for life
I'm a psycho that won't pipe down, boom
Exploding with vial statements, holding my own totaling, total annihilation
I'm master no debate, I'm fashionably late
I'll grab a rapper by the face and smash 'em like a plate
So play that Madchild till your boombox shakes
Put two guns in the air, like a Boondock Saint
Stick a catheter, up the ass of a damn ambassador
I fucking massacre, bashing up every passenger
I search around for words like I'm a scavenger
And take a hot blood bath with Potpourri and Lavender
Abracadabra, grab your cadaver and masturbate
Then eat your brains like I was Hannibal then flatulate
I stand for something, I remind you all of better times
I ain't giving up my fucking spot, you better get in line
You can not imagine all these thoughts that's in this head of mine
Yup, I'm independent like the trucks, I'm on a steady grind
I am the greatest and I'm smashing these potato heads
Better bring my money, like a waiter with a plate of bread
I'm a maniac, an animal when I'm released
Even though I found my inner peace, I'm still a crazy beast
I'm a monster with these bars bro
Fuck a couple groupies at my show after the bars closed
I can write these raps with my eyes closed
Even though I'm old, I am Ice cold
I'm a bastard that's a basket case
All I need's a rope, gloves, a hammer and some masking tape
It goes trolls, demons, monsters, ogres
Watch us come together homie, play time is over
Represent the crazy and I make these rappers piss their panties
So fuck you and your whole dying flock of vigilantes
Little incredible hulk
There's no forgetting I'm off against incredible odds
Chomping through these bars with metal jaws and little bursts of fire. Dressing like I finally won
Used to have the worst attire
Feel it coursing through my veins, addicted to the pain
The sorcerers insane
Spit four fiery rhymes at night, like clockwork
Treacherous, I'm sketchy, unfortunately awkward
Partisan in progress, replicate a reptile
Duplicate the greatest and I'll put myself in exile
I contain the answers that so many people seek
To truly find my happiness I had to be a freak
Shadow agent, hear the visions of a mad man
Blood fire, blood fire, bloo-, I'm a bad man
Makes sense of this insanity
Eventually reality will catch up with my vanity
Created a monster, creator of content
Statingly obvious, hating the non-sense
Reanimated human corpse, galope like a human horse
Come back like a boomerang and hit you with a booming force
I'm the opposite of all these little copy cats
Tell these little motherfuckers little Rocky's back
I don't write raps, known for writing mission statements
Still getting a little bitches from these vicious statements
