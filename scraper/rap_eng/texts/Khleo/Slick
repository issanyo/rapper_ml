Monster chain, topic of discussion (Trending!)
She know about me, that's why yo girl blushing
I'm all in, I said I'm all in
Everybody show me love, all I do is win
My whip slick, my chick slick, my kicks slicks
Boy I'm living slick
They try to shake me off, I make 'em so sick
And when she see me, she say 'Khleo baby you so slick'

[Verse One]

Slicker then your average, look at all the karats
Make Lola Bunny leave Bugs, she talkin' marriage
The only thing I'm tied to is living for the work
And if I die young, then I'm just another ?
CoCo Bang, Jimmy Hendrix, 27 Club
It's a damn shame, isn't it
All I do is plot about the steps I need to take
Why they copying my Slick, not originally traced
They some lames, we some Ceo's
Stepping over those who pose
Living life slick, girl don't try to act like you don't know
I don't drink but you can, take the bottles out the ice
I don't smoke but you do, nah baby that's alright
I'm different from 'em, call me unique
I'm Khleo baby, I'm in my own league
I run the show, I run the city
Lightskin J, the west coast did it

[Hook]

[Verse Two]

My city love me, cause Khleo be putting on
My chick love me, cause she got them Louboutins
Been around the world, I'm a rolling stone
And I'm comin' for the throne, don't let me get in my zone
I'm on my game like Madden
These squares messing up the game, straight laggin'
I can teach you how to play the game, you know the rules firstly
Your girl lookin' good, keep the other girls thirsty
Money coming in fast
Louis belt hangin' off my ass
Forget being rich, I'm tryna see the world and make it last
Invested in my own stock, working my way to the top
Jersey Shore artists, all they do is flip-flop
One minute you bangin'
Next minute you think you sangin'
Mumbling all on the track, tryna figure out what you sayin'
I'm not calling out no names, cause I do not really care
Everybody was thinking it and I'm just putting it out there
Khleo!
