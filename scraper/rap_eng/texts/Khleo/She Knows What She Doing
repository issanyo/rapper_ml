[Verse 1: Khleo]
Freaky Khle's back
Red corset with the red heels
Ice on my tongue, she give me chills
Playing slow songs off the macbook
Looking back, asking baby how it look
Baby you my motivation, Kelly Rowland
Legs 7-10 split like I'm ballin
She know how I like it, tease me just a little
Playing camp stories, play me like a fiddle
Drop draws, top off, floating in your ocean I'mma cast off
Shawty ride clean on my limousine
Going till the 2 nothing in between

[Hook: Khleo]
Shawty give me some good
So I give her some sweet
Way she take it down, champion to me
She knows what she doing, yeah
She knows what she doing
Shawty, she a pro so I throw her to a d
Baddest one around, the champion to me
She knows what she doing, yeah
She knows what she doing

[Verse 2: Khleo]
That body wet, that booty soft
She steady leaking, Niagara falls
She say my name back to back 3 times
I spread the love, peace sign
Lipstick on me, like a wine glass
Her hourglass curbs make the time pass
She do a good job, service with a smile
She want that in and out and I won't stop
We rest a bit, we catch our breath
Then she bring it back, like we playing fetch
The way she do it, I can't deny
I'm a fiend for ...

[Hook: Khleo]
Shawty give me some good
So I give her some sweet
Way she take it down, champion to me
She knows what she doing, yeah
She knows what she doing
Shawty, she a pro so I throw her to a d
Baddest one around, the champion to me
She knows what she doing, yeah
She knows what she doing
