[Intro]
Kinda broke this evening y'all
So all I got is 5
I got 5
Khleo
You know I had to do it

[Verse 1]
Baby girl the baddest, been seein' her
It’s something bout her aura like her name Rita
Got ass like her mama and her aunties
And she down to ride like Bonnie
Bonnie, Clyde, open wide
Why not? Make it rain for them thunder thighs
Strip search, can I pat it?
Let me put this 5 on it, let me grab it
I’m a G, a mack, whatever you wanna call it
Either way, yo girl, she in here bout to pop it
Why you tryna cuff her? She ain’t even break a crime
Let that girl loose, let her do it for the Vine
Go on throw it like you mean it, watch a nigga keep it
Run into the endzone, intercepted, Darrelle Revis
Look at all that cheek-age, look at all that cleavage
Got her butt where my head be like Beavis

[Hook]
Hands on your knees, rotation
The way she make it clap, standing ovation
Do it like you do it when there’s no one home
Do it like you do when you got nothing on
Pi-pi-pi-pick it up and put it down on it
Shawty ass fat, put a crown on it
Up and down the pole, the way she grind on it
Hands on that ass, I got 5 on it

[Verse 2]
Got her hands on her knees, ready set bounce
Bands on me, in a large amount
Tryin' to blow it like a candle on your birthday
You tired of these lames cause they all thirsty
You got your friend in here with you
A cup of liquor, and she tryin' to kiss you
Got Miley all in your system
Tryin' to knock 'em with this wood like I’m superstitious
With the quickness
All my niggas pull dimes
Got her heels on, and we call her high 5’s
We don’t need much, just a bottle of Ciroc
Supper club, fireworks, and they comin' from the top
Slick Living Gang, yeah you know it when you see it
Girlfriend sending X and O's, but I ain’t The Weeknd
Phone steady ringin', always getting money
Never care about a hater long as my bitches love me
That’s slick living

[Hook]

Hands on that ass, I got 5 on it (I got 5 on it) (x4)
