[Verse 1: Khleo]
Pockets on twelve, preteen
Girls b-b-booty bouncing like a trampoline
I just wanna cut movie scene
Shawty MJ bad, B-B-Billie Jean
Mary, Carrie, and Jane
Yeah, they all the same
And China got a big ol' ass that can't be tamed
But I'mma put my stamp on it
Give that ass a name
Call it Team Khleo
Now go insane

Gripping booty in my left
Got a camera in my right
Steady taking pictures so I won't forget tonight
The way she's dancing on me man, I'm about to take her home
And if you know the words shawty
Go and sing the song

[Hook: Khleo]

[Verse 2: Khleo]
Take it off
Let me see
We ain't got to wait
Take it to the back seat
Call me what you want
Yeah I'm a freak
But all the girls getting naked in my bedsheets
We got Tonya, Pam, and Nicki
Drop-dropping down they vickies
So I'mma take my belt off
And show 'em all my Dickies
P-p-put ya' birthday suit on
I'm the wish
Blow me out
Sexual pilates
Work it in
Stretch you out

Gripping booty in my left
Got a camera in my right
Steady taking pictures so I won't forget tonight
The way she's dancing on me man, I'm about to take her home
And if you know the words shawty
Go and sing the song

They wall stand when I walk by
That grown man

They wide open
Cause they know
My stones cold
They gotta have it
I'm a beast

Chiropractor
Get it crackin'

Got it tatted
Baby what's ya' name
Tell me, what's ya' sign
Tell me what your drinking
Take a sip of mine
The she's dancing on me man, I'm about to take her home
And if you know the words shawty
Go and sing the song
