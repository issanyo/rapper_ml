I been watching you
So tell me what to do
I want it
Girl, I need it
Give me all of you tonight
I want all of you tonight
Girl, don't be shy with me

[Verse 1: Khleo]
I've been fantasizing about you since before I touched down
Knowing that I need your body on me right now
But I got moves to make though
So baby, just lay low
And no, you can't come girl, unless I say so, ha!
She been having flashbacks by the last time
From behind, now a nigga had to smack that
And that goes, who booty it is?
Left her ass speechless, I had to read her lips
She been blowing up my phone all day
Send them pics, askin', "Can I hit your way?"
I reply, "Baby, gimme a little more time"
Then she said I can't wait to blow your mind
Your mind, your mind
Neither can I
Can't wait to walk in, and look you dead in your eyes
Cause you know I'm trying to kill it
But I'm trying to give her life
That's how it's going down by the end of the night

[Verse 2: Khleo]
Playin' with each other hella mind games
And it's getting worse and worse as the time change
Talkin' 'bout how we gon' start it
Talkin' 'bout where we gon' end it
Her meditating with the murder 'bout to get a sentence
She done went shopping for a few things
Came in a pink bag laced like shoe strings
She know my favorite color red
She settin' the mood, candles all around the bed
Baby girl, I really need it
And I know you need it too
Ain't no more talking
Baby, show me what it do
Alright, 'bout that time
Can't wait to walk in, and look you dead in your eyes
Cause you know I'm gonna kill it
But I'm trying to give her life
That's how it's going down by the end of the night

[Hook: Sean Roxs]

[Bridge: Khleo & Sean Roxs]
Hey love
Came in just for you, I know you been waitin' so...
Talkin' 'bout what you want
Everything you need, I got
I'm trying to make you mine, girl don't be shy
