[Verse 1]
Been on my mind all day, I'm in the mood to play
I'm tryna see what's poppin' tonight
Baby say the word, I'mma come and get you first
We can do whatever you like

[Verse 2]
Lil' mama listen, we've been talkin' for awhile
Never once have I brought up me wantin' to take you down
But I feel like there's somethin' you wanna get off your chest
Like a bra, on a size 34 C breast
If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong, if I'm right just let me know
You can trust me with the keys, baby let me take control
Cause I could take it slow or we could move it to the fast lane
You could ride stick then you control all the kissing

[Hook]
It's okay baby it's alright
We ain't gotta do a damn thing tonight
But tell me what's the deal, baby keep it real
You just gotta let me know exactly how you feel
It's okay baby it's alright
We ain't gotta do a damn thing tonight
But if you change your mind, baby let me know
Cause I don't mind helpin' you up out your clothes

[Verse 3]
You know that I be starin' at your body when you look away
I wonder if the panties you wear underneath your jeans are laced?
Somethin I can't help like, when you say I'm cummin'
My mind loses some bolts, imagination stays runnin'
Know that I'm a freak and you knew that before you met me
But you'll never see that side of me until you say your ready
Even then, I'mma double check; cause it just Ain't about the sex
I don't want it baby but please don't take that as disrespect
Just tryna preserve, this feelin' that I have
No matter how deep down I wanna tap that ass
And give you somethin youve never ever felt before
I hope you know

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Girl, you done made up your mind?
You said it's time, guess there ain't a point of me tryin
To try n talk you out or reconsider your decision
So bring your fine ass over here so we can just get busy
Lay your body down, let me make your eyes roll back
You been runnin all night, girl you might just catch a cramp
From the bed, to the kithchen and constantly switching positions Ha!
When I'm done, let me wipe it down
Now feel me kiss you down your back, with this ice in my mouth

[Hook]
