You say you love me

We grown
Nobody need to know what's going on
Everybody tryna be up in my business
Hush your mouth and I ain't tryna be offensive
But when I'm tryna score
I need assists from you
& When your girls ask
Tell em play the game guess who
No Sub-tweets
Its just gripping sheets
You hitting your peak when
You belong to me
Cause the city to small
And my name to known
Last thing I need is somebody to
Say something wrong
Wanna be with me
You gotta know I love my privacy
Keep 100
You never gotta lie to me
Soon as I see you slipping
Girl you tripping
Script get to flipping
See even though Im messing with you I don't really need u
Now saddle up and let freaky kle please u
Chorus
Chris Batson
Yeah
Late Nights
No lights
Fuck conversation we don't need that shit
Sex, love, and passion man I breathe that shit, I breathe that shit
Lemme know how you want it, how you feeling
Only if you down for the night keep it real and
I can take you higher while we blasting no ceilings
Shit man you already know what we dealing with
That's real as shit, this is it, and I really wanna make this happen girl
Uh
We can keep it low key fuck everybody asking girl
Uh
And the night just feels so live
Girl are you down to ride
Chorus
Khleo Thomas
