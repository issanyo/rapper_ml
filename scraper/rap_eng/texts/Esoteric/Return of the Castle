[Chorus]
Wild like a rock show, catapult,crossbow
Main Flow the king is back dog, y'all know
Bring the forces, round up the horses, prep for battle
Return of the castle, return of the castle, return of the castle

[Verse 1]
As soon as i light, conducting my platoon is the height
The tune that i write, bright like the moon in my sight
It's been a long road, stay in this song mode, bong load
King conversating at the stronghold
Crap for radio, is candy boss
When i rap i touch down, like Randy Moss
I got a global plan, that's got me out in Robo land
Mobile hand, that of a prince or a noble man
Rap's greatest find, watch what i say to to shine
Play the grind, and im always staying on a hater's mind
Sleep with the heat, words frequent the beat
Deep with the sheets, i live in a secret retreat
Chain frauds, long enough to hang broads
Slang odd, banging on your city like the gang squad
All didge, bottled up in a tall fridge
Small ridge, dark moat under the drawbridge

[Chorus]
Wild like a rock show, catapult,crossbow
Main Flow the king is back dog, y'all know
Bring the forces, round up the horses, prep for battle
Return of the castle, return of the castle, return of the castle


That's the shit yo, original diplo
Chain, nail,sword swinger, right from the get go

[Verse 2]
Bar and a spy, calculating car and a eye
The par that i fly, far like a star in the sky
We at the weight spot, with a great plot
Straight shot, killer nights that make your state hot
Ice in videos melting man
The get money, and switch teams, like Elton Brand
I got a tribal show, so i can let a rival know
Survival pro, Flow will make the scriptures in the bible glow
Raps realest swag, i got the illest tag
Chillest sag,peal his rag money to fill this bag
I create pay, to go with a great day
Late stay, battle walls that have a gateway
Sip becks, got me looking for chips next
Flip checks, higher than them towers on them ship decks
Lend me a bribe, or just send me a scribe
Defend and vibe, my village like a indian tribe

[Chorus]
Wild like a rock show, catapult,crossbow
Main Flow the king is back dog, y'all know
Bring the forces, round up the horses, prep for battle
Return of the castle, return of the castle, return of the castle


That's the shit yo, original diplo, chain
Nail,sword swinger, right from the get go

[Verse 3]
The stash faze, your lost living in the last days
Im past blazed, and your lungs are the ash trays
Now you owe Main, dealers that stole cain
The soul train, long like P.A.'s goldchain
We sang hooks, then slang books, to sting crooks
Bring looks,then i castle with the kings rook
G powers, all types of free sours, key hours
Surrounded by the three towers
Return like the turnpike, to earn nikes
Learn strikes, words that naturally burn mics
I catch a hassle stare, and i dont even rassle there
Visionary project like a castle in the air
Star best, when the bar rest, bizarre mess
Far west, like Sactown and Artest
Concerned shove, you a prince with a perm and dove
Until it turn love, this is the return of


[Chorus]
Wild like a rock show, catapult,crossbow
Main Flow the king is back dog, y'all know
Bring the forces, round up the horses, prep for battle
Return of the castle, return of the castle, return of the castle
