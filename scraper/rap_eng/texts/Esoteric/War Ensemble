[Intro: (sample from "ApocalypseNow")]
"In a war there are many moments for compassion and tender action, there are many moments for ruthless action - what is often called ruthless - what may in many circumstances be only clarity; seeing clearly what there is to be done and doing it, directly, quickly, awake.."

[Ikon the Hologram]
I exit out of my sarcophagus
Fourth Horseman of the apocaplyse
For my esophagus breathes evil that just demolishes
Abolishes, to the darkness of Mephistopheles
Mental enteral that went through an ancient acropolis
Conquered this, from a fetus to genius
Took DNA from the Shroud of Turin and cloned Jesus
Merciless leaders, the 19th galaxy
Born to a storm on the seas of Galilee
Battle me and suffer whiplash from my apostles
Leave you in shackles in the castle of Nosferatu
Ikon is hostile and mortals cause contusions
Hologram is known for placing poison in Christian communion
Slash, with the actions of ultra-violence
Crucifixions, in diction by Pontius Pilate
I walk naked in the house of David with pride
Force you to bleed just to make sure that you're still alive
Crystallize, we keep it live, y'all can't see me
Banish satanic verses like Ayatollah Komeini
I break in half, Satan's staff with ancient math
I wait and laugh, create a *fucking* blood bath

[Esoteric]
I bring the gory oratory yes demorally derogatory
Mad expository expedition in your auditory
Categories don't apply
Your mind's eye is blinded by my battle raps
Like cateracts your habitat is Halifax
Once I run you out your native city
Shea's committee is pretty witty we show no pity
I deflate the second-rate wack MCs who replicate
Every trace of Esoteric found up in their record crate
I devastate, homosapian metabolism
Like human catacalysm inbreded with an anachronism
My precision makes incisions on your acrotism
Battling is a bad decision leaving you with aphorisms
I whoop ass like masochism dominatrix
That's the basics
Hologram brought The Matrix
To fake kids
Fifty dead MCs to my credit
Learn from the druid better known as Esoteric

[Virtuoso]
In this the final conflict high powers and commandant's to enlist this
The fluid I spit is viscous
Without so much as whispers
And with the swiftness of what you transisted
Can carry info, a window's left where your wrist is
Directly cut by my discus
Forged upon the anvils of Hephaestus, hand-to-hand skills
I slam your damn grill
Execute in Greco-Roman holds
Roll in Trojan battle gear
Exploding through the atmosphere
I saddle fear, read cerebral centipedes
As evil steeds the feeble flee
Holdings severed rapper's heads toward the sky as trophies
As to be viewed by the mischievious eyes of Loki
I hated your verse so I went back in time
And waved a dirk at your mother's warm uterus
To kill you before you were born
Like fried yolks my hands split the trunk of petrified oaks
It's time to die folks
You think that I joke
I leave your thighs yoked
Your wrists are broken, tied to horses
Quartered as forces pull you in opposite directions
Dissection of my anatomy
Will lead to the unveiling of what it shield
In a tiny toddler wielding
A giant computer body
Which is similar to RoboTech
Downloaded wreck
From the million megabytes of rhymes that rest on Virtuoso's neck
