Check...yo

[Verse 1]
Check the rap cat spit the phat shit to mack dips
While you pack clips and bag bricks to stack chips
I only smack dicks if they act slick
And only jack whips if they model flagships
The type to flow and strike your soul
Blindfolds and mind control kid its time to roll
Cuz'I taking MC's opperating like MD's
Send freeze through your chest, worth ten G's
Or maybe more, because the rap style is crazy raw
I'm breaking backs taking it back to Eighty-Four
You could never Find no iller cat spit, no realer rap shit
Gorilla rap shit, ban Esoteric when I attack shit
Your flow was tighter, we'll make your shows tighter
Man at loose cannon to hold your toes tighter
When Esoteric shines kid it gets no brighter
You couldn't be fresh if Shay was a ghost-writer
That's my real name, your shit real lame
Your image is a scrimmage so mine's the real game
I'm putting it down plus I'm on the attack
With a verbal assault, crab cats fall back

{It's very likely you know what I'm saying}

{Grab the microphone and keep the place hoppin'}

[Verse 2]
My rhyme scheme blinds nineteen fiends like high beams
Shatters pipe dreams of teams like crime scenes
The production, plus my raps bring destruction
Dangerous like spontaneous combustion
I rush in, bring MC's to their knees
Jewel thieves, rap cats those who move keys
I'll take that wife on you, take that ice on you
Sell it back to your ass raise the price on you
When adversaries bite the "Dactyl" will have to strike
Beat rappers with the mic like I practice every night
Vocabulary's tighter than a "Seven-Forty I"
I mortify forty-five guys for their lives
The forty-sixth make sure he cries before he dies
And tears from his eyes made my name immortalize
Esoteric, certified heat speaker
Beat freaker puttin geeks deep in the sleeper

[Verse 3]
We wreck tracks suffer no setbacks and stress cats
To the max slapping up vestax you get back
Shay you've been born
I'm ripping stakes up in any way shape or form
Check the brainstorm, when these fake kids get torn a new ass
Bullet-proof glass can't last
Went up against the mass I'll splash your broadcast
Rip your sound station
Dictation, blow strips off your foundation
Now you all know Ralph at all shows
I scalp all pros like Al The Salvo
The Teradactyl, swooping like a scavenger
Calling shots like a passenger add em' in to capture ya
Run right, through your gun fight during thug night
Still touch mics AB positive like blood types
Word up kid I'm on the attack
With a verbal assault crab cats call back
