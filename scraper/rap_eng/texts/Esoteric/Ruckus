[Verse 1]
[MFN]
See we lockin' down rappers like we got a quota to catch
We squeezin' they necks, step, spit words hungry, I'm still feedin' the nest
But hey the plate clear, look nothing is left
What the? (yup) tell the waiter lady bring me the check
And I'm on one, feelin' like I popped one
Young don son, kill 'em with the Malcom
X flow, make a milli, still be ridin' the metro
(Ah hell know) You the type to follow everywhere your ex go

[Esoteric]
These corny rappers want to battle E.S
That'll be stress for the team call the cavalry yes
I automatically bless tracks my pimp hand impress macks
Get the rap trophy for the clique, facts only when I spit
'lo pony on the chest, couple hoes be in the whip
Uh, you know my style, I'm slick
I put it down for my team, supreme like the cutlass
Anywhere we go you know we bringing that ruckus

[Hook]
Anytime you see us out we be causing a ruckus
That's why they looking shook
We be causing a ruckus
These bitch rappers won't look
We be causing a ruckus
Anytime you see us out we be causing a ruckus

Murder tracks, word of mouth
We be causing a ruckus
Up north and down south
We be causing a ruckus
We put it down and air 'em out
We be causing a ruckus
If you ain't talking business, there ain't no discussion

[Verse 2:Esoteric]
Shay & Miles, blazing amazing styles
We connect like, Anthony Davis' brows
Wild, slay the crowd, karate chop mollywhop
Rappers just standing there like a lobby cop
So I gotta make their bodies drop, body rock, pop and lock
You sound wavy? nah you transform like Autobots
And roll out, Miles we got this (No doubt)
What you know about ballin', son, you getting blown out

[MFN]
Blown out, showin' out
Guarantee we bring the Oh's out
Now you got recipes for us
Cause we getting dough now?
They got that airplane mode flow
No buzz, no love
Blessed to have loyalty, we ain't never checkin' our shoulders
Not cool until we top shelf, eatin', cheesin'
Countin wins up to the ceilin'
On the low commitin' treason
Cause we, sabotagin' anything we get handed
Abandon landin', parasailin' through the sky fore we vanish (auh)

[Hook]
