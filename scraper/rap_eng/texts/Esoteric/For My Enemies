[Verse One]:
Everybody got a clone
Mine has got honor throne
Condescending rappers like I'm speaking with my mother's tone
Spring like a ninja
Rocked in December
Now it's mine I got it locked for the winter
Kinda like my summer home
Looking for another home
You would think that I was home schooled
I'm in a class of my own
I be in the fuckin' zone
Like I'm up in Vivid Video
Chillin' with a gritty ho, my city know
"You should hear my cousin rhyme"
I hear that shit a hundred times
Hollywood and Basic that's to peace to Dave Funkenklein
As you got is sex raps
Soundin' like my uncle's lines
Your writings lower level, it should be an underline
I like my beats rock steady in the summertime
I like my girls top heavy like number nine
Music in a sneaker box
Louder than arena rock
You were raised on Speakerboxx
I was on a speaker box
You were raised on Equinox
Not me
I was O.C.'d out with Fudge Pudge feature hops
Rappers really need a lesson
Really need some redirection
My secret weapon's Marciano, yeah I keep 'em guessin'

[Hook]:
"Cause I'mma do it for my enemies"
What what?
"Cause I'mma do it for my"
"Cousin"
True
"Word"
"Cause I'mma do it for my enemies"
What what?
"Cause I'mma do it for my"
"Cousin"
"Oh shit"

[Verse Two]:
Lyrically designed to slaughter
I'mma kill it kinda sorta
Rhyme recorder with a mic in my hand like crime reporters
Every time that pen hits they wanna get forensics
And haul away/Holloway bodies like, uh, Christina Hendricks
Oh you don't watch Mad Men
Well you wouldn't get it then
If your flow is sick dawg, I'm the veterinarian
No, not a Nazi, no I'm not a veteran Aryan
O'Reilly killer, tried to say I'm un-American
Call me 00 cause these rappers keep on perishin'/Parshing
I bring a posse to the door as if I'm Christmas caroling
And...

[Hook]:
"Cause I'mma do it for my enemies"
What what?
"Cause I'mma do it for my"
"Cousin"
True

[Verse Three]:
Every verse every stanza can hit
Like terminal cancer, kill all the verbal commando
And I be verbally sl...alright, enough of that
Let me spit it like this
Let me slow it down and kick it like this
Let me rip the sickness
Let me get so simple and so stupid
You don't even wanna listen to it
I be teachin' MC's like I'm the Druid
And I...am or was
The game change and you just can't adjust
Is you man or muss?
That you can get crushed
When you dealin' with the E.S.O
People they can meet death slow
Cause my words hold weight like the killer whale
Yeah they tilt the scale
I'm for real I prevail
I got enough bars to fill the jail
You press 99K
98K is still for sale
If I'm cocaine rap you are a Pilsner Ale
If I need water, yeah you gotta fill the pail
If I am Adamantium then you are acrylic nails
No matter how much you say A/aye
Dawg, it's still a fail

[Hook]:
"Cause I'mma do it for my enemies"
What what?
"Cause I'mma do it for my"
"Cousin"
True
"Word"
"Cause I'mma do it for my enemies"
What what?
"Cause I'mma do it for my"
"Cousin"
