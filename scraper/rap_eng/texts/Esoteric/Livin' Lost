(Verse 1)
Slaine

Yo I roll the dice kissing my palm, a real gambler
But my mission is strong my vision is long
The hardest artist with the pen leaking my pistol is drawn
I walked sidewalks that wished I was gone
Fistful of Psalm, my punch is full of poetry, a pitbull wit rhymes
I roll with dollar bills and I puff my nickels with dimes
They put me in the hospital. Told me I'm sick in the mind
Police pull me over searching for a pistol to find, da nine!
So maybe I'm defiant and young
But I can see my future in the silent eyes of my son
He sayin' "Daddy is an animal. My farther is a sicker soul. Held his gun close to him, always drank his liquor cold!"
Such a cold bastard I was
I was only passionate about my past as it was
Perhaps I'm to consumed about the cash and the drugs
I shed tears when they ask what I was, I was livin' lost

(Hook)
Money money money got my mind on it
So everyday I'm on my grind homie
Got no clue 'bout when my time gon' end
Like I'm living my whole life blindfolded
I'm lost
(I don't I know where I'm going to)
I'm lost
(But I can't do it without you)

(Verse 2)
Esoteric

Ya, makin' rap records got me livin' lost like Jack Shepard
No place to hide, no spots to rock, like the black leopard
But I tackle the gazelle, battle rappers till they fell
Insane asylum, whining that they padded to the cell
All you gotta do in 2010 is rap on twitter well
NFL chain movin' to the city citadel
I ain't BC I'm a ?mac? so forget it ?Del?
I rock a jersey in Jersey without a bit of gel
I spit it, tell the truth, the kid is hell on wheels with that ?bitter? smell
Like ghost rider, no ghost writer most critics fell
Yo, I'm tryna bake it and fake it until I make it
But that recipe is sacred, don't you ever mistake it. I can't
Give up yet, yeah the wis??? upset
I'm livin' lies, livin' lost, got us livin' in debt
We livin', check to check like tenaments in Prague right?
Shit is fucked up every day and every night

(Hook)
Money money money got my mind on it
So everyday I'm on my grind homie
Got no clue 'bout when my time gon' end
Like I'm living my whole life blindfolded
I'm lost
(I don't I know where I'm going to)
I'm lost
(But I can't do it without you)

(Verse 3)
Krumb Snatcha

Back then, murda murda all a y'all homie
Never think one blink, wrap em up like ???
Live wire, the mind is electric
Melodic, hypnotic, robotic who tryna set shit in motion?
Rub 'em all out like lotion
Deeper than the ocean, pen and the pad my potion
I'll hex ya like voodoo, who do more?!?!
The young Islamic, Raja Mohamed wit metaphors
Been lost, what it take to be the best?
Cover all ground, a human GPS
Never have to stress, get lost and I'm coastin'
To the game relief like IB profen
Step on stage make it scream like banshees
What you know about government cheese and their pantries?
I came from the bottom, man I deserve this
The flow Esoteric, don't get Slaine by verses

(Hook)

Money money money got my mind on it
So everyday I'm on my grind homie
Got no clue 'bout when my time gon' end
Like I'm living my whole life blindfolded
I'm lost
(I don't I know where I'm going to)
I'm lost
(But I can't do it without you)
