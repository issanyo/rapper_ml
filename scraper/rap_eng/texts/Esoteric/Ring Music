[Dusty Rhodes Sample]
I am bad and they know I'm bad
And there were two bad people
One was John Wayne and he's dead brother
And the other one's right here
Mark this down in ya book daddy
There's a big difference
Between the legend, and the man
And I want you to take a look
At what will happen to you
Then next time you step in the ring with me
Because, as we start to watch this thing
I, am the legend
You, are the man
And there's a mighty big difference between the two

[Beyonder]
Rock with me y'all
Rock with me y'all
Rock rock rock with me y'all
Bars Of Death y'all 7L y'all
ES y'all c'mon c'mon

[Esoteric]
Chill chill
I got this I'mma take the weight myself dog
You ain't gotta spot this
Y'all playin' a violent game
I write a rap spit fire like plywood planes
Dangerous type connection 7L
E to the S it's a rap ring the bell
I got the game on lock while you struggle
You stayin' up to ya neck in Bills like Bledsoe in the huddle
The way I'm flowin' is heat the temp a million and one
I'm tryin' to keep a cool head like Ted Williams son
I feel ya son, if you do salute the champ
Recognize and return that ass to boot camp
Yo Hawk and Animal hit the ring bring the madness
Road Warrior Black Sabbath the Bars Of Death
With this mic in my hand
I'm like the Legion of Doom comin' out to "Iron Man"
Understand, it's ya last one so take a breath
And pretty up you muthafuckas have got a date with death

[Beyonder]
Yeah do it 7L, do it, do that shit oh

[Esoteric]
It goes one for forensics two for the shell
Three for my DJ known as 7L
ES, I'm back in the verse crackin' the earth
Lyrics, lift ya spirit like jackin' a hearse
The boys sick, somethin' musta happened at birth
He rep the Bean, but he ain't strapped with a curse nope
It's in my head no need for pen and pad
See my mothers mind makes me one intelligent lad
And um, these good looks? elements of my dad
Chicks be findin' me magnetic like I'm mentally mad
Hella bent in the lab, loose like a decayed tooth
Demigodz Pharaohs I rep the heavy set like Babe Ruth
Think twice before you battle my team
You don't wanna scream and end ya career like Howard Dean do ya
I seen through ya, flow lacks the patterns
You can't run no type of game without askin' Madden
Put my shit online hit you with enough amps
To take down the net like division one champs
