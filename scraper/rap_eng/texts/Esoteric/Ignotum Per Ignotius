Over whom does infinity hold sway?
All the time has passed
No future awaits
Where there is no light
I shall remain
Never to diminish, nor comprehend
The one absolute

Within eternal twilight I exist
Excised from the stream of time and being
I wander
Answers I seek
To that which I cannot know

You need not to fear now
For release shall be yours
Through golden fields you may walk
All knowledge flowing through you
Let your pain console
For escape is nigh
Your blood flows, your soul is released
Silentium est aureum

I have come to know all
Yet I know not time
At your death
My torment is complete
Horrific realisation
Time demise of finality
Absolutions collapse
