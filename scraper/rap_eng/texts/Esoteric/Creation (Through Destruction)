Night surrounds me
As I sit alone
In the indecipherable darkness
I smell the noise of past

Vivacity of the wind begets clear my mind
In eternal isolation
Those that pretend to care,kill you
And leave you for being dead

I seek,for where am I?
The throes of death swirl within me
And I smile.....

Life,raped by disease
Cast out
No place for me here
I create my kingdom
Creation through destruction
Cut out the heart of the Christian disease

Knowledge my fortune
I channel the strength of my will

The lure of the moonlight
Streams forth,with abundance of strength
I bask in it's essence
Devouring the force
Succouring my veins
I traverse to the beckon of my desire

Destruction
This stagnant humanity serves only to frustrate
Unfit to stand alone,huddled in their masses
Synonymous in their worthless existence

The time will come to pass
Creation of life
Destruction of the disease
