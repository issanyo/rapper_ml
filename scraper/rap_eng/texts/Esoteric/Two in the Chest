[Verse 1: Esoteric]
You know the age old saying with dead role playing
Leave an a-hole in the k-hole praying
Newsflash, this is how an emcee sound
I put it down like no-look dunks from Dee Brown
We in the house
[?] two doors down from two Thors now
Evil, Lex Luthor's style, the crew's all wild
The price of death never been cheaper
And you ain’t gotta notify your next of kin neither
You can't sleep 'cause the inn keeper is the Grim Reaper
I'm a sin eater, Czarface the ringleader
Bust a nine millimeter rhyme at your two-seater
Crush your spine with a lethal line, you're an easy bleeder
I'm a mind reader so I transform the streets off
Wide-eyed looking at bodies like you're complete soft
My pen ain't deadly, depending on how the beats are
It's deadly 'cause I made it explosive, you know how geeks are
Each bar leave a deep scar, we spar
In the East where the beasts are
Catch my metaphors kind of like Bautista
Respect authority, I'm throwing up a police car
Rugged flows, I'm Eleven with the bloody nose
Telekinetic, you rapping telepathatic
I bring stranger things
You'd think a demon was arranging things
Godly king
My change of rings smash my angel wings
I'm a nice guy, but only off the track when I don't rap
You been a dick, no Cumberbatch
If the beat cut the right field like Mookie Betts
I might just hit you like two in the chest

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
(Yeah, Czarface, face off)
G in the game, youngins dream of being the same
No, you couldn't be me without feeling my pain
Throw up the grind, snake eye, notice the shine
Hit 'em with a quick clip like I'm posting a Vine
Off of the bread, violators, off with their head
Rather walk off to ledge before talking to Feds
Working your brain, fast life, merging my lane
How I crush up the base like I'm serving 'em 'caine
Hate if you will, I still get 'em papers and chill
Baggy jeans sag really, that’s the weight of the bills
Swim with the shark, boy, you getting lit from the start
Saying life's like a movie and I'm living the part
Deck is a Beast, naturally they envy me
Limitless lines, you swear that I’m on NZT
Dude is a vet, INS schooling the best
Lose your breath when I hit you like two in the chest
Hit you like two in the chest, hit you like two in the chest
