I can't control them, but they control me
The voices can't be heard. they're kept out of sight
Hatred from within. purged from the soul of me
Leads me to destruction. they need my detonation

Hate...
Wild...
Pass...
Away...

Death eats away from the inside
Life eats away from the outside
In between...in between
In between...in between

Void
Pointless
Existence...

Over over over and
Over over over and
Over over over and
Over over over and

Make me see the
Birth of my insanity. reality
A memory...
My mind recoils...

Push...down...
Push...down...
Push...down...
Break...down...
Break...down...
Break...down...
My mind makes things happen...
