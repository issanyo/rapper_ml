I look back at nothing
Questioning my singulation for pain

The torment, the tears that flowed
Living my death every day
Seeing my death and fantasising regret from those I once cared for

The foolish dreams of my once young mind
Now void of hope
Aged so quickly before it's time

And no one could see or hear me
Confusion was my only friend

In the dark I grew
Twisted and torn from the intense cold that poured over me
I searched and found
In the dark so long that now I may see
Through humanities' ignorance, lies and stupidity
But the pain still breathes inside of me

Pain. Pain. Inside of me:
