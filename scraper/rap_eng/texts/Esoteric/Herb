[Esoteric talking]
This some quick shit, check
You're a herb, ain't nuttin', it's like this
(You better ask somebody)

[Verse 1: Esoteric]
You're a herb, if you say you dig all the time
But can't find a sample from beats to the rhyme
A herb, if you claim your raps is official
But everything you sample is a fucking re-issue
You're a herb, saying that you rhyme of the mind
But your hype man's backing up every line
If you're in a fight but don't really wanna scrap
But act like you want it when the bouncer hold you back
You're a herb, if you tip strippers with a dollar
Those who grab the coke and then call yourself a baller
A herb, if you just now saying holla
If you meet a girl but are too shook to call her
If you act cool but keep your girl on a leash
If you're still talking 'bout the Jay-Nas beef
You're a herb, if you saw episode one
But never saw the trilogy, I just begun
You're a herb

[Hook]
(You better ask somebody)
(You're herb)

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
You're a herb, if you got a flag on your truck
But before last September you never gave a fuck
A herb, if you put your faith in the churches
If you call yourself Bin Laden in your verses
A herb, actually, better yet a joke
If you glorify suicide and doing lines of coke
If you traded in your comic books and stamps
For an Avirex and some Southpole pants
You're a herb, if you live next to Forrest Gump
But go to school tying your bandana in the front
(You're herb), if you got skills but dress like a nerd
Just cause you can rap doesn't mean you ain't a herb
Herb, you're a herb if you claim fame
But hype yourself online with a fake screen name
Act violent and claim to hold things
Rapping like a thug and walk around in toe rings
You're a herb

[Hook]
(You better ask somebody)
Bust it, right before I'm out, yo
(You're herb)

[Verse 3: Esoteric]
You're a herb, if your man buys you a Beck's
And you're too stingy to buy him the next
But you'll buy a drink for the opposite sex
The type of guy that snatch whole albums of the neck
You're a herb, if you're falling for the Puma fads
Cause they got a pair of turntables in their ads
A herb, if you never pay for a date
A big herb if you never reciprocate
If you gotta leave the room or change up your tone
When you talkin' to your girl on your cell phone
A herb, if you steal out the tip cup
If you wear your hat with the visor flipped up
You're a herb, if you like this but don't own this
If you think it's funny when you're fucking with the homeless
If you tuck your sweatshirt in your jeans
If you diss the Guru because he left the Bean
You're a herb

[Hook]
Motherfucker, yeah
(You better ask somebody)
Take offence, word up
(You're herb)
7L on the track
Esoteric with the rap, herb rappers fall back
(You're herb)
Yeah, (?)
(You're herb)
