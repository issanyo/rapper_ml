[Verse 1: Esoteric]

7L
ES
Uh
Yo

I don't gay bash, I straight diss, rate this
Underground cats hate this
Your rap's weightless, while mine's heavy like my thoughts be
Applaud me, my presence: godly
I'll take the mic stand, throw it like a javelin
Rip the cable, beat you with turntable
Put your head through the stage on a rampage
Smack your man as he bringin' you the bandaids
Talk about a fake crew
Your posse just met and your hype man hates you
And tell your girl still standing in line
Aye yo, don't wear Ecco and Gucci at the same time
(You should know) the two just don't mix
Kinda like most DJs who do tricks
You been doin' this since 1986, right?
So why can't you blend tight?


{Put your mouth on board, put your brain in gear}
{ba da buh ba...}
{Don't front, get up, let me know whats happenin'}
{ba da buh ba ba...}
{Put your mouth on board, put your brain in gear}
{ba da buh ba...}
{this is the jam [?]}
{ba da buh ba ba...}


[Verse 2: Esoteric]

I. Crush. MCs. Down to dust
When I bus' lines like greyhound
Stay down, control your peeps on the playground
Come back when you're serious
You don't deserve to be wearing this title of MC
Or that 'B' hat, give it to me
[?] literally, hurt you critically
Whether kickin' a free or doin' that shit physically
You better listen to me, learn how to fuckin' rap
Your engineer's fingertips are wearing out the decals on your ADAT
Machine (know what I mean)
We can battle on the mic, battle on the tables
Battle at a party that was thrown by your label
If the loser has to leave, and smoked a bag of weed to get bids
You'd be hidin' outside like [?]


{Put your mouth on board, put your brain in gear}
{ba da buh ba...}
{Don't front, get up, let me know what's happenin'}
{ba da buh ba ba...}
{Put your mouth on board, put your brain in gear}
{ba da buh ba...}
{This is the jam [?]}
{ba da buh ba ba...}
{Put your mouth on board, don't front}
{Get up, let me know whats happenin'}
{Put your mouth on board     stay cool
{Stay cool, give me some space}
{Put your mouth on board, get up}
{Dont front, don't front}
{Put your mouth on board, put your brain in gear}
{Never givin' up cuz I persist to be the dopest}
