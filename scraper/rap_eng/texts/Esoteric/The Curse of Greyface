It's now or neverwhere, we're here to disappear. a persistent minority within shadows of impossible light! it's nothing less than unbelievable. hidden graves, impossible shadows, nothing less than interpretation not to speak of truths as phantoms. strange attempts, time well spent, lift our hands to grip the stars in memory of the future. the eternal return -- come again and again. how many times must we realign and rebegin? the heart of darkness holds a light within, the end of history -- nothing but a state of transition. inherent, it just goes. transparent, it's unborn. burning this veil with waves of will. haunted and humorless as their own heads...the curse of greyface. forget us, we are passing show. we are here to go. none of us are ok. all of us are fine. don't let it stop. stop at your eye. it is now or neverwhere. we can't wait for the world to turn by our own fire. we shall burn. it is now or it's neverwhere, we're here to disappear. chaos so necessary. you so indifferent. a path of certainty -- to know what is meant by endless absence! passing of skin, a time to rebegin. eat your karma alive. everything changes, one into the other. the eternal return, a passing of skin. how many times? must we realign and rebegin?
