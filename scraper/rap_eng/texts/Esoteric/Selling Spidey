[Verse 1]

Growing up a lonely kid, everyone would notice it
Had a lot of friends but always liked to be alone and shit
Playing with my actions figs, some are small, some are big
I would leave em out and watch ma do flip her wig
Sea was crazy before ‘88, G
Before the internets, before ADHD
Back when four quarters equalled two hours of Double Dragon
And thirty minutes of your mother nagging
I’d go nuts on white powdered donuts
Saturday morning saying I don’t wanna grow up
Then I be on baseball, twenty dollar games
I’d put Lance Parrish in the Hall of Fame
Today it’s all the same, ain’t shit changed
I still got a favourite, you know his name is

[Chorus]

Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever a spider can
Spins a web any size, catches bad thieves just like flies
Look out

[Verse 2]

Spiderman cartoon dog I kept on
Loving the KPM soundtracks he crept on
Loving the Daily Bugle he stepped on
Loving the wit and wet fluid as a weapon
Jay Jonah Jameson, Green Goblin, the Vulture, that’s my culture
Yeah, fuck Reaganomics
I was hooked on Marvel Silver Age comics
Trying to tell em y’all, they was jealous y’all
Now I gotta sell em all cause my bag’s hella small
Fuck I’m mad but I need the paper and I need it kind of bad
Off they go, bring me the dough
So hard to say goodbye to my hero

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

At my yard sale, that goes, that stays
Sold my X-Men dog to Matt Rays
97, 98, 99, hundred and one, hundred and two, yeah missed a few
I don’t care, I got em saved in the back
I can’t give up my shit like that
Sold the Conseco, Don Russ rookie
For the price of a box of Chips Ahoy cookies
Two men looking at Spidey’s first appearance
Like wow, I hope one of them buys them
That’s my cash cow
One sale and I made a mess of it
The other dude said he got the PDFs of it
What? Sixty bucks? That’s a rip
But I need every penny so a bye for the friendly

[Chorus]
