I have a million questions. but no will to ask
Through chaos. rationale speaks clearly
Decay sets in amongst the fragments...
Such weight lies within knowledge
Crippled by thought

Eyes that see too much lose the will to see
And the pain that spills from these walls
Blasts through this withered body

The circle has begun
Time is not won
Losing this battle to remain

In this place
I dare not dream
For awakening the demons that will find me
Blinded by madness

Such endless probability
And I must know every thing and every thought
And I must uncover all answers sought
For sleep eludes when this frustration taunts
And drives me to release
Or travel towards end

So dead inside
And all but to live on
Burning from within

Maddened eyes
Filled with boiling blood
Sullen
Grow sharper with the pain
To rest now
Until we meet again
