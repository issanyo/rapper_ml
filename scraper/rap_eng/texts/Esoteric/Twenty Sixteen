[Intro: mukna$ty]
Twenty sixteen, baby, baby
Twenty sixteen

[Verse 1: ragsy]
Check all the boxes on my common app, please
Made that Jan 1st deadline, and I did it with ease
Just kidding, hitting submit was the hardest thing to do
But hey, look at me now, senior year semester TWO

Now we've got all of the time in the world, what's the plan?
Telling Kenny Iams to pleaaase chill with the homework, man
But I guess that SSS lyfe was always just a lie
A pipe dream for first semester to keep us alive

But it did its job well, and now we've made it through
Switching round our priorities, doing things we wanna do
Only got a few months left, time to make that bucket list
Tryna take that LA trip, tryna get that first kiss

But unfortunately, this right here is a year of lasts
Last prom, last rally, last time in a high school class
The clock is ticking - on the surface we look serene
But underneath we all wondering what the hell the future's gonna bring

They just called my name
My body is getting up but my heart wants to stay
In the city where I grew up and I learn-ed to say my name
I'm ready to touch the sky but I'm afraid to fly away

[Chorus: mukna$ty]
Twenty sixteen, baby, baby
Twenty sixteen

[Verse: esoteric]
First things first I missed the bequeathals
Shoutout to BBoy A-Bird, his beak’s lethal
Shoutout to our club and the art room crew
It’s never too late to start too soon

AKA the procrastinator’s anthem
Instant gratification can’t hold that for ransom
Was the first day of high school I caught the senioritis
So you know it took me all of six minutes to write this

That was a lie, it’s only during rapping we
Can pour our hearts and shirk the apathy
I wouldn’t waste this opportunity
To show y’all just how much you mean to me

Our last bittersweet year of high school
I expected goodbyes, endings, and finals
But I found new faces beginnings and firsts
For example, I’ve never spoken a verse

Never had I danced before a rally
Or tour colleges like in northern Cali
While Rags’s on the lookout for some kissing, some frenching
I went to my first anime convention

I strutted onto campus freshman year
Thought I was the shit like fresh manure
Wanted to stand out like I’m the freshest here
All it did was scream insecure

No longer on the bottom come sophomore
Just one year later I’m greedy for more
Afraid of missing out call it FOMO
Afraid of wasting those years, wish I had 4 more

I envy our underclassmen because
Their minds are open, empty flasks and beakers
But we make like cylinders: we graduated
Stay in skool kids you’ll be glad you made it

[Chorus: mukna$ty]
Twenty sixteen, baby, baby
Twenty sixteen

[Verse: mukna$ty]
Rappin across the seas, nah I’m talkin about the streets
The hallways that we used to walk on the daily
Bittersweet memories of the sharp E
Ringing through my ears as I walk into Mr. E’s

Barraged with work as a little freshman
I didn’t have a plan, ye I tried to tame my zen
But Nah we good, I got onto the train of thought
Had my peers telling me to never quit, never stop

Always tryna strive higher, reaching for the stars
Hoping we would get there, victory would be ours
Repaving the name of the game with precise aim
I'm tryna not to cry, tryna keep my rap tame

Made it through Wonderland as timid little flowers
Evolved into demigods and made everyone cower
Building towers, and hoping to leave a legacy
I look back and I see a fantasy that became reality

465 of us running round the school
And four years later, man we all still fools
Nah of course i’m playing we all hella classy
It’s 2016, the class who’s always rowdy and sassy

The class that makes me want to celebrate and get happy
The class that makes my voice go raspy at rallies
Yeah you already know though, asking me to join the track
My voice ain’t all for show though, yeah it can reflect back

On the bars with my boy Jeff, Rags, Eric, and Chee
We came a long way and sprouted up like trees
Boutta do bigger and better things next year
Two zero one six, we onto a new frontier

Y'all are family, those late night homecoming runs
Damn I think I'm shedding a tear, can't believe we’re done
I'm getting on the feels, got something in my eye
Peace out yall, flying out like a butterfly

[Chorus: mukna$ty]
Twenty sixteen, baby, baby
Twenty sixteen

[Verse: echee466]
This rap right here, is about letting go
At a crossroads, what the future holds, nobody knows
Ain’t about the fame, nah this stuff is personal
Too many memories, more than I can count per a soul

And how do we soldier on in the world lying ahead
Where uncertainty is a certainty, watching where we tread
We live and learn from experience if it’s pleasure, if it’s pain
Please take these rhymes serious, trip down memory lane

Stepping on to campus as a freshman, having no connections
Knew nobody, was misguided, having no direction
High school came directly at me, surrounded by high achievers
Sense of fragmented unity, got me feeling quite meager

Time went by, things changed, school a little more inviting
Adapted and learned, days a little more exciting
Homecoming, powderpuff, rallies, the class was so inclusive
But that feeling of acceptance was still ever so elusive

With almost four years under my belt, I grew even more
Well known, never felt alone, truly changed at the core
Seniority was our advantage, and this year we were better
But it never was bout the decorations, it was the people that truly mattered

What does that mean, let me explain, where my logic stems
10 years from now, do we remember the decs, or the people that built them?
Building off each other’s friendships, and our horizons always expanding
A web of different thoughts, but a collective set of understanding

We at the end of the line, lost touch with friends I can admit
But they continue to touch my life, even if now they aren’t in it
Meaningful relationships don’t have to last a lifetime
2016 will always be my family, that I can’t deny

Don’t view this as a rap, imagine this as a story
Of how new surroundings and faces, aren’t scary just temporary
Pages always turning, but don’t forget about the past
Meet new people, keep old ones, and form connections that last

[Chorus: mukna$ty]
Twenty sixteen, baby, baby
Twenty sixteen

[Verse: jeffjar]
Never have I shed more tears so full of joy or fear
Than as I cry or cheer about my past four years
Reminiscent of the red bricks I’ll leave behind
Apprehensive of the mountains I’ll need to climb

This place has shaped the base of who I am:
I learned to love music from nostalgic jams
From a time when I jived and strived to be alive
Connected in legato with my fellow pink bowties

Then they were gone like vitamin B4
I felt alone, but that mighta been before
I found my scientific home, in the club and the bowl
Where my inner kid smiled at the beauty of the world

Like bacteria in colonies I flourished exponentially
And lived a science dream on a livestream nationally
All my pleasures have a worth beyond measure
But at Lynbrook, the pressure sucks the pleasure out of pleasures

We waste time pursuing hollow fame, and
Replace life with the college game, we’re
So obsessed with success, all we stress is
Excessive impressive BS in our resume

It's all crap like air in souffles
Deflates and falls flat once it’s a new day
I’m sick of all that, but I’ll never run away
Cuz college is the same situation

But with different game rules. Now we’re chasing jobs
In place of big name schools. We’re still the same fools, so
Without the hobbies we follow or the music we play
What’s the point of it all, at the end of the day?

[Outro: mukna$ty]
Twenty sixteen, baby, baby
Twenty sixteen
