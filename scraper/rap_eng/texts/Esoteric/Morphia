This air of silence
Breathes through the sullen mist
Transparent winds
Ease these age-old wounds

As stale thoughts disappear
Through Morpheus pathways
I am in wake but dreaming

This warmth annuls
As time drew slowly upon this wretch of life

Weary sighs of condolence never did urge with zest
The fire within hands made to rest

Swallow me within sin
This blood flows free through my veins
Procure my will through lascivious rite

Delving subliminal realms
As lust invites me to stay
Engulfed within flesh

Casting gaze at the puppets
Acting out their play
Their slightly wooden frames
Stretched and splintered by their masters

Crawling beneath their minds' eye

Those whom follow, reflect
And do not become

Not to be...Not to be...

Their words waste my time here
With their fragrantless tones
A veil to distract those whom wouldst live

To create
Not to serve

I walk amongst the shadows of the dead
Thoughts bleeding into the ether

Into endless night
