You obviously, underestimate Seay's unruly cadence
Killin crumbs, rippin apart bums
Scarin tons on paper, I nail foes lyrically
Ill creator, there is none greater
Plus automatically I neutralize opponents naturally
But reality attacks in numbers systematically
When I trap hoods you got blast, understood?
Real words are known, crush kings at their thrones
Exceeding miles past the standard
And terrorize the real imposters, purposely planted
I never give my instincts chances
Rapidly obliterating people hating
On neccessary Esoteric shit devastating
On new terrain entertain verses emulate rain from Ukraine
Catastrophically kill whenever I touch heads
Execute suckers orally kid is dead

16 lines 32 rhymes 93 words
Check it
You take the first letter
From every word I spit
You know just who you fuckin with
Some afranomical shit
7L on production, uhh

You suck crab
Stop inflicting pain on brains with YGB (your gay boredom)
UR (your) wack attempts at ripping microphones
Don't ever fuck with Eso kid
