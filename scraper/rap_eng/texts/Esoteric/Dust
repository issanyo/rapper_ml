[Verse 1: Psycho Les]
Yo it’s major when my pen touches the paper
I’m the fall guy lee majors
You minor, we major
I’m stunning I got these fans fainting in the front row
I keep the blunt rolled, the true stories untold
But keep in mind, I’m the greatest of all time
The flows on beat, and my verse is on time
From Killa Queens I got that potent shit that killing fiends
I never snitch, even in handcuffs I won’t spill the beans
Player this is real shit, I move the crowd with real spit
This is my turf, you’re just here visiting on a field trip
I’m a pimp allergic to shrimp so I don’t need it
I might eat the coochie out before I beat it
The mission to get a million dollar commission without selling out
And keeping the tradition
I don’t like to fuss, you don’t want to fight with us
If you wanna take it there you’re gonna bite the dust

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
Throw in the towel this is a murder most foul
When the verses go blaow
Heavy lies the cowl, of the king; the ruler;
Overlord; the jeweler
But this ain’t a rope chain its cooler
Yo this lands my Dominion
Ya man is a minion, listen
This ain’t for your girl to see this between the world and me
My style is, coast the page with the malice
I’m an ink slinger you a drink bringer get my chalice
I stand and fight, my stance is panther-like
Cold world  [?] the same shade of anthracite
Look and see bars are candy coated maybe sugar free
My acapella a novella I should be on Book TV
I go to war but I radiate peace
I got faith in your release like an atheist priest
You can’t baby a beast
The laboratory’s dark, the sword is sharp
Longer than a 40 part story arc

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Your’s truly ruley Step through em, do em fools
Quick, opening credits still in the movie
My persona you can feel in the next room
Deeper than most, this was ghost-written by Neptune
Step on the scene make them lean on promethazine
My glow bright I flow tighter than Vanessa jeans
Ear surgery when they heard mines
And I’m stuck to the city like Wayward Pines
So I spit that real ‘cause it get that real
Overtime on the grind to get that meal
Fam holla when you cut some bread
‘Cause other than the money I ain’t heard nothing you said
I zone like an NBA team in the 2-3
Laid up at your bae crib steaming a QP
Say go when I take control
No they can’t escape my bars like a con who ain’t make parole
