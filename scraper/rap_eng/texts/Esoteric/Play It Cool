[ verse 1: Esoteric ]
I'm a cool cat, 'I'm poison' like G Rap
My rap's too fat, it's overweight and out of shape
I devour fakes, spit em out like sour grapes
Break em with the rhyme and make em into wine
Like Zinfidel kids can tell that I'm rippin well
They sit and dwell while I spit in hell
My accent is game for dames from out of state
And about these fakes, yo, I break their tapes
I'm the type of cat to hit a funeral an hour late
Carryin the same flowers from the wake
But make no mistake, I'm far from cheap and I got a little dough
A little low, a little hoe, I spit a flow
Hit you like Riddick Bowe, you didn't know?
My rap rank is so close to its pinnacle
You know the deal son, when you hand me your vinyl
You get your record broken like the homerun title

[ Chorus ]
I'm a cool cat, 'I'm poison' like G Rap
My rap's too fat (you gotta play it cool) yo, true that
I'm cool (cause coolin is all that I'm about)-- Special Ed
'Just pullin all the girlies, yes, I'm bustin it out'
I'm a cool cat, 'I'm poison' like G Rap
My rap's too fat (you gotta represent) yo, true that
I'm cool (cause coolin is all that I'm about)-- Special Ed
'Just pullin all the girlies, yes, I'm bustin it out'

[ verse 2: Esoteric ]
I'll decapitate your men, take your pen, spit a sacred gem
People, play for them, I pull your card like an atm
Throw you off the stage like a shitty mic, did it right
'We don't want no beef at all, ' me, I wanna pick a fight
I'll do anything to rattle you, swing a bat at you
Cause I'm mad at you, I'll do anything to battle you
Say you made a song just for you and your friends
And in one line diss somethin like suede Timbs
I make a suede Timb anthem, say it's from '93
Play yours and then mine and say, "I think you're dissin me"
And while you're thinkin up excuses I be diggin you a grave
Hit you with the flav, burnin you and stick you in a cave
You're dead broke and yes, I put money on it
The only ice you rock got Bugs Bunny on it
'Yo, I ain't ripped in a minute' No? Well, enter the stage
You'll be 'gone in 60 seconds' like Nicholas Cage

[ Chorus ]
