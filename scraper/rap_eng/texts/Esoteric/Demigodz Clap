(Verse 1: Apathy)
There's a whole lot of rappers
That claim they so street
But all sound the same like reggaeton beats
I'll swing on your jaw
And leave your dome piece broken
And spin your face quicker than a sidekick open
If my label doesn't get my album off of the ground
I'm going to rally my fans and burn your offices down
Radio for back up, another officer down
Connecticut's king, that gets back to polish my crown
I'm from the era when the mixtapes were standard cassettes
Lamped in a Lex with Nike airs and Champion sweats
Now a days we them psychos higher with the right flows
Kill ghostwriters and give your wigi board typos

(Verse 2: Tak)
Say yes, say when, we don't pack pads and pens
Act bad, get the crap slapped out of your friends
I turn rap to crack rock and sell it at base price
If only you could fit bass pipes in a laptop
It's not a problem, I take it back to the blacktop
The Demigod, King Kong, killer Godzilla
Raw spit spiller, cap peeler don with the gat cocked
Style of Beyond and on and on
Yeah we chill with Jay-Z but I call him Shawn
It ain't nothing, I crush him until they chest is flat
So clap for the rap fucking phenomenon
(Make 'em clap to this)

(Verse 3: Motive)
Yo, I'm here now
So don't worry where I came from
If you trying to find this nigga weakness
It ain't none
See I could spit some shit
That can leave your brain numb
My aim is to bring the game back
To what it changed from
Niggas is fake though
Garbage and I see through it
Hate mo is marketing yayo like G-Unit
The Godz a squad and yes, we rap cousin
And now we back like we mother fucking left something
And I ain't with none of that backpack rap shit
But I do keep a mac in my bag if you act slick
And when it get pulled, it disperse with a clip full
With a bite that's worse than a pit bull

(Verse 4: Ryu)
We close to the top, if not, it ain't far
My choice, it must be the voice, the next Gang Starr
So taste the brand of amphetamines for your whole squad
You sniffing this, you'll swear to God
You saw me landing a spaceship
Robotic hands with legs and animal faces
Chopping the grains of sand to side of bacon
An exact spiting image of animal Satan
Carrying Los Angeles on his back for ages
Whoa, crush the razors, sip the wine
The Demigodz invasion cripple your mind
I'm a tell 'em again, ripped cat, dude from S.O
Stand up for the jam, heat clap, now let's go

(Verse 5: Celph Titled)
Reporting live from the planet of the disturbed
You'll think we smoke a massive amount of weed
Cause of the way we hit herbs
Now which word got you offended
I give a fuck and since an infant, I've been a misfit
You see the way the kid spit
I've got Raven Symone craving my bone
Cat fighting with Hillary Duff putting artillery up
(And they don't know)
The Demigodz a force to be reckoned with
(So play your part)
Or get a tek to your neck and shit
Yes, I'm with a naked bitch all night
All night with a blow job, she careful around my waist
Because a gun might go off
Hip hop to you is probably Color Me Bad
But it's a fact I've been down
Since Michael Jackson was black

(Verse 6: Esoteric)
E.S. like a slasher flick, master sick
Waste to leave cats hacked to bits
At the same time relax with the Maxium chicks
Snatching flicks because you know I won't remember that shit
Pass the fifth, Demigodz a squad, we're ruthless
You're useless like blind men with pool sticks
Exclusive Nike's ain't exclusive
When they're found on the feet of every doofus
Your man's a goner, that thug persona
Makes me laugh like Jon Voight in Anaconda
The pterodactyl is back, I'm landing on ya
86 Rocket, Ralph Sampson on ya
Larry Legend leaving the gym at 2 a.m
Carrying weapons
