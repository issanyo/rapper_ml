I cry and my eyes spill blood onto the floor
Acheron flows in silence
And the noise intensifies my pain
No will to speak
Not even enough hope left to weep. Anymore:

I travel on through the noise
Searching for relief
Distorting my mind
Only when intoxication distorts is the time I can laugh
When clear I laugh only through scorn

For I have seen of the blackest
And each sight hath taken from me
Such misery:
Such sorrow:
Such desolation:
Such death:and I've travelled for it in times of silence

Close to death so many times
When my hope's been shattered
When my anger's been unbound
And my torn soul has cried out for death

Killing myself through constant abuse
But I have always awoken
My scars still bleeding
And the noise it still carries on:
