Inside and around I see misery, suffering
A new level of depth for my depression
Thought I could only climb from now
Unable to see below its depths
Got used to it so that it wasn't as bad

Now on my dark ledge I am falling further
Where are my friends? Someone grasp me
But no one reaches for I have nothing left to give them
My use for them is gone and so is their respect for me

Hitting a deeper level I crash hard
My anger screams, sorrow and hate contorting together
In a fit my temper explodes, tearing my hair, punching my face
Ripping my skin to release it from within

Screams of sorrow increasing my hate
Sentences flash through my mind of all that they said
Of those I regard that hurt me
Emptying my soul, devouring my will

I'm alone and always will be
I've known no one who hasn't hurt me - and often with intent
I walk through crowded streets of faceless people
Their whispers haunting me:

Trapped in a void with myself who's not me
My knowledge and power are all that I own
My compassion is destroyed, my hate free to explode
Now I will always destroy those who try to hurt me

[Music - Gordon. 2/1993]
