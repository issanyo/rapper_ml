Rage intensifies my desire for revenge
Hatred flowing in my blood
My veins expand to release the pure, unbridled, abhoration
For those who interfere with my life

They caused me sorrow
But pain will be returned

My mind turns to execution
My sadism fed by their obliteration
I laugh at their death and scorn their pathetic existence
Now to non-existence
The thorn in my side caused me pain
My logic eradicates at the root of my problems

Those who would give me pain
Would also make themselves a thorn
My cure is to remove the cause

Remove the cause

(Music - Simon. Autumn/Winter 1993)
