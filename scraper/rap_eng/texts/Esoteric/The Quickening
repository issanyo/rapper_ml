[Verse 1: Planetary]
Back at the yard again, horrifying horror harvesting
Awkward like my origin, obvious god with a pen
Hawking a Benz on your carpet of tens, I'm lost in the winds
Offing the officers inside of my office again
The offers are in, I'm taking, I'm running, I'm gone
Blazing and running I'm drawn, more clips dumping in songs
You say something is wrong, asking what planet's he on
Earth is my mind is in but Jupiter's what I'm actually on
I'm practically spawned from a pharoah, my life different
My knife ridges sharper than ice, is it I'm nice with it
It got to be that it's probably cause it's obvious in fact
It's popping I'm probably polying with lottery stacks
Illegal alien desert eagle Damien's partner
The bullets make a harder departure, shit's a rocket launcher
And I'm a monster in under armor
The calm of the storm, the horror is on
You niggas is barking I'm gone

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
I paint the town with outrageous sounds, I'm a Pharoah
I leave you looking like you Richard Harrow
You're back up on my shit again
Say hi to my little friend
I'm crushing all you little men
Wild cat like I'm Kentucky bred
I don't buck the lead I press the lead to paper
Pen off another caper, you
Wasting time with all them hundred bar verses
Cause I murder ya'll and send you home in hundred car hearses
Cause you worthless
Off to the races I'm quick
Cough in your faces I'm sick
You don't need a coffin cause I'm probably crematin' your clique
Listen I'm making a list and killing every name on it
Might put the blame on it, track I'm insane on it
Dick with your dame on it
They call 'em chin up bars, every word you hang on it
Like Big Daddy Kane on it
Use your brain, you's a lame, ain't no way to soothe the pain
Pharoahs putting you to shame

[Hook]
Come on die now
Every time we spit rounds everybody get down
Lose your life now
Every time we spit rounds everybody get down
Take your life out
Every time we spit rounds everybody get down

[Verse 3: King Syze]
Underground king shit, Pharoahs we breaking the cycle
You dead on arrival, we coming and we taking the title
We back at it, old school rappers don't want no static
Our tour should be covered by National Geographics
Carnivore addicts, no suppressing to kill the appetite
A rapper's life of smashing mics, niggas just not rapping right
Ya'll acting like the takeover, its already happened
An arsenal of ratchets if I'm talking backpacking
There ain't no acting, I live right in the cuckoo's nest
Since the days of buddah blessed, my flow has been ludicrous
So who is next in line claiming they repping?
But there ain't a weapon that can stop all this natural selection
And you can count on the Army man we always supplyin'
We like roaches, we always living and never dying

[Verse 4: Blacastan]
Ay yo we blacked out, trenched down
I'm Marley in Trenchtown
Cock back, spray rounds, leave you drenched down
Run from the loud sound or we be on you like blood hounds
Pharoah clique live in your home town
We capitalized like we be sticking up pronouns
Didn't know you know now, guilty never blow trial
Stick you up face down told you we don't play clown
When it come to spraying rounds, collapse and niggas lay down
Standing here flack planet permanently etched in granite
Coward niggas panic, haters simply can't stand it
Sail the Atlantic, crushing tours like Titanic
We impact the world nigga, gigantic

[Hook]
