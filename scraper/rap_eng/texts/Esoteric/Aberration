Staring as I prepare to leave this mortal coil
To pass through these portals
To the gateway of experience

I release, into this sense of falling
Hallucinations flood my eyes
Thoughts, memories pouring through

Racing unchartered (sic) vessels
Evolving through this twisted, psychotropic journey

Drifting within waves of consciousness
Momentum gathers swiftly
Pulsing, gathering intensity

Deeper still
Nausea rising from the depths
Bent double with psychosis
As vomit and blood spew forth
Time and space distort as the earth pulls me down
Into a place I have never perceived

Clawing for reason
Imprisoned within my own delusions
Pouring frantic visions into my eyes
Between drowning and burning alive
Forcing each breath
Through thoughts that endanger the being

Lost within the throes of madness
Anxiety tearing the foundations of my mind

Drifting through the otherworld
Slowly it subsides
Conscious returns, shaken, disinterred
