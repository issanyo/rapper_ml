Hook
"You can fool the last one but you can't fool me"
"can't fool me" (x3)
"You can fool the last one but you can't fool"
The simple fact it's the G-O-Ds"

[Verse 1: Apathy]
This is the hardest record all year, mark my words
From the dark I emerge power sparks the surge
Got juggernaut strength lift buildings with both hands
Crush a tank like a child stepping on coke cans
The gigantic beast must be out of my mind
Electrically charged I jump rope with live powerlines
On some real shit, body made of steel shit
Travel with more nines than "bring your 4th graders on a field trip"

[Verse 2: Blacastan]
You never heard a nigga that can spit it like Blac could
Fiend out niggas steaming crack in they back woods
Grew up in a black hood, rocking a black hood
Rhymed on a corner til my rap got good
I studied the art like you should
Rhyme for rhyme I abuse it, get used up
Please don't confuse us
For happy niggas at the back of the bus
Get your green bags up and in Demigodz we trust

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Esoteric]
I'm sick and twisted like a juggalo with aids
Or a Stephen King page or a dying grandmother growing braids
I'm so driven I get road rage on stage
Thoughts, liquid crack, I move liters like motorcades
I've been on plenty tours dealing with these crazy whores
They need their head examined like the AVN awards
I'm '87 wars, pick apart you bastards
On a powertrip like Ahmadinejad on acid

[Verse 4: Motive]
Not with the fooling with hard spitting hooligan
When he's out they like, "Aw shit it's you again?"
They can't stand me, I'm known to keep a slammy
The only thing you pack on your hip is a fanny
Doeraker pharmacist, paper become anonymous
Flow so psychotic bitch, lyrically we opposites
In other words y'all can't tell me shit
You pay the same price that the deer caught up in the headlights did

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Eternia]
You cannot attempt to meet at the mountain Iâ€™m on
I climb higher than the rapper you just smoked out to get on your song
Thinking you're on, you're more off than a circuit that's blown
After a storm I'm that verbal hurricane then I'm gone
Don't pretend that you matter you don't
I'd rather speak the truth than leave you out for the choke
And besides you need some lessons my suggestion is nope
Don't do it your intentions are mess and I see through it

[Verse 6: Celph Titled]
IED under your SUV, escalate your Escalade
Fucking fag, I got a duffle bag full of 'nades
Add a clip, and some track, what I'm aiming at
Failed arithmetic but at marksmanship I'm a brainiac
Suffocate, twist, and arch your throat
Maybe you should dip because I mastered the art of choke
Start to provoke, talk loud or try to speak out
I'll break your arm like Sean Combs did to Steve Stoute

[Hook]
