[Intro: Sample]

[Verse 1: Cadence & Esoteric]
[Cadence:]
I guess if anything can happen, then it probably will
But I'm prepared to navigate it if I don't stand still
It's like the oceans with perpetual motions and notions
I follow and swallow needs, prepared to face the challenge like Apollo Creed
And hope I make it to part four, and start more faces and turn in phrases
Cadence stays above the hard floor
And if I find myself faced down on the linoleum, it's only one loss
And one loss, it's like petroleum
