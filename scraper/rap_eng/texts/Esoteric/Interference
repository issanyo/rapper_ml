[Verse 1: Esoteric]
I’m the OG of AOTP
I don’t fuck with bitches if they OPP
And force under boards like Charles Oakley
I tie up your family let the dogs go free
There ain’t shit about rap that you could tell me
I beat-bop like my man [?]
I’m Rondo on the mic with the illest speed, you know how guerrillas feed
Legend in the building, word to Willis Reed, number nineteen
A mic fiend, it’s me now
In ’04 I was known for dunks like D Brown
No pumps around me now
I stay up with Kate Upton types, you seen with a sea gal
Phantasmagorical, metaphorical flows
I’m with Eric in Paris, in Paris you doin’ horrible shows
Rockin’ deplorable clothes, only found on clearance
Bring in the cuts and now, run the interference

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
Defecation on the mic
Gotta whistle when I shit they know what side to wipe
Probably why I face the stage and the crowd hype
‘Cause gangstas show me love from Compton to Crown Heights
[?] with DJ JS-1
My freestyle the teacher like KRS-One
I walk in rap battles and they pray I test none
So [?] when I say your best done
Rolling Stone song, no satisfaction
I could be your life coach, Tijuana Jackson
[?] with a overbite, time for some action
Marchin’ 9,999,000 black men
Clinton 2016 poster
I’m screamin’, “Vote for Bill!”, in the Pope-mobile
Yeah and that’s why I think niggas need steel
Learn how to be real? Just listen to B-Real
