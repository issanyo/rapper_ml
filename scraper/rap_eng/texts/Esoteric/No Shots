[Hook]:
"Yep, you know this"
Back on my rap shit, boom clap clap shit
"Bring it on down"
"Yep you know this"
Back on my rap shit, boom clap clap shit
"Bring it on down"

[Verse One]:
Zoned out
High school D
Tight Gumby that's the high school me
I air rappers out like flight school B
Somebody gotta say it might as well be me
See, I was raised on D.O.C. and Tim D.O.G
How the fuck can I respect groups like 3OH!3
This ain't Wiz Khalifa
It ain't Drizzy neither
I ain't dissin' either
I'm just a disbeliever
That Young Money diva kinda made me miss Latifah
(Why's that?)
She hop on everything she got a busy beaver
E.S., I murder mics/Mikes like Demerol
I keep the pen/Penn up on me like the logo on a tennis ball

[Hook]:
No shots, no shots but we blow spots
And we focused
"Yep, you know this"
Back on my rap shit, boom clap clap shit
"Bring it down"
No shots, no shots but we blow spots
And we focused
"Yep, you know this"
Back on my rap shit, boom clap clap shit
"Bring it down"

[Verse Two]:
Fuck it
I go online read 'em brag about their new shit
I click play but all I hear is Debbie Downer music
And somebody gotta, lobotomize my brain
If I'm supposed to tolerate dudes like Waka Flocka Flame
Or whatever the fuck's his name
You ain't ahead of your time, you way late, get in line
Listen
You don't know the pain
Guru passed we were mourning
Then Travis Barker gets the cover of The Source and
I'd rather be a washed up rapper on a pacemaker
Then have to bow down and listen to these taste makers
See there are new cats that are dope like Freddie Gibbs and
Then the poser dudes lookin' like Debbie Gibson
You hear boutique rapper, you think unique rapper
It ain't the case, they as common as the street rapper
We shouldn't be in the same sentence of rap music
In fact my name should have a period attached to it

[Hook]:
No shots, no shots but we blow spots
And we focused
"Yep, you know this"
Back on my rap shit, boom clap clap shit
"Bring it down"
No shots, no shots but we blow spots
And we focused
"Yep, you know this"
Back on my rap shit, boom clap clap shit
"Bring it down"

[Verse Three]:
It's been a long time
I wonder, now where has E gone?
I'm a Stone's Throw away, ask Egon
I spit freeze/Frise
No Bichon
Hyako Akita dog, no leash on
I get my paper baby
I get my green on
Turkey bacon only time you get your lean on
And me doin' somethin' with you?
It's like Trump in your crib countin' money with you
It's like Bird in your yard shootin' jumpers with you
Redman gettin' blunted with you
I'm above what you do
Don Draper style, scowl
T'd up like a flagrant foul
The fellas say "ho" and the ladies say "oww"
Sounds like domestic violence
Self absorbed like a paper towel
Yo I, shine all day so bright
I could wake an owl
Flow tighter, a ghost writer, you can pay for vowel

[Hook]:
No shots, no shots but we blow spots
And we focused
"Yep, you know this"
