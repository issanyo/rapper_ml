[Verse 1 - Boy Pierce]

When it's chilly I rock 'em over the ear, silly
Ear bud sunny, honey, running 'round the city while I make money
Funny, my soundtrack it pounds back
Reinforces, it's an endorsement, a sound pact
Endorphins, saw her sitting in the rain
Raindrops falling on her, bumped in
Awkward pause...song...long...gone
Never to be seen, baby only in my dreams
But not necessarily, rocking so merrily
Slow, slow, slow your roll, stop with the parody
SoHo spots and froyo shops, robocops
Bootleg perfumes for blocks on Broadway
Hustle all day, whistle while you work
Listen what the song say
Go ahead and just block 'em out, walk a block around town
Footsteps and your favorite sound

[Chorus - Boy Pierce]
I can't walk without the sound in my headphones
(Sound in my headphones, sound in my headphones)
Navigating through the crowd as I head home
(Crowd as I head home, crowd as I head home)
I can't walk without the sound in my headphones
(Sound in my headphones, sound in my headphones)
Navigating through the crowd as I head home
(Crowd as I head home, crowd as I head home)

[Verse 2 - Esoteric]
I need the sound of the beat so I can beat it down
He's around geeks and clowns steppin on uneven ground
Leaps and bounds above ya'll, feelin like the king is crowned
No LeBron, weight of the world, but my shoulders strong (ugh)
Power trippin but it isn't what the potus on
Bangin beats on the subway or when I mow the lawn (hold on)
Turn it up, turn it up, make sure the sound is loud
So I ain't gotta hear you sayin "check my Soundcloud"
You can cell 'em earbuds or call 'em headphones
When I'm in the dead zone they'll lay 'em on my headstone
Put in an album and recite to 'til my mouth hurts
Hang in central where they slangin pretzels on the outskirts
Bangin tracks that are vintage like betamax, play some wax
Take 'em from the racks like bodega snacks
Goin way back like just Just-Ice Kool & Deadly
I need my Walkman like Peter Quill to rock steady

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Boy Pierce]
So def (BP!) I keep em on my home desk
Walking by a hostess or grotesque homeless
Sleeping on a park bench, reeking of some raw stench
Construction site, right, I leap it like I'm Clark Kent
Super hero when I loop my heroes on a drum loop
Pups woof, doves poop, rock ‘em in the club too
(If i went), heaven sent, strangers like Eleven’s tent
Passing I’m blasting the nastiest heavy sets
They be liver, lyrics deeper than a navy diver
Catalogue i’m batting off barrages like I’m Baby Driver
Make deposits out my wallet while I never pause it
Crossing walking east heap of fruit stands and street meats
Nauseous but I’m knockin it for days and obsessed
Steady breathing passing Europeans craning they neck, yes
You know the deal, so check the cassette
It's Boy Pierce and MC E-S what you expect?

[Chorus]
