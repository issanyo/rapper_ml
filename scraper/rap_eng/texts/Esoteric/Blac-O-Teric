[Intro]
All aboard
Watson and Holmes
Watson and Holmes

[Verse 1: Blacastan]
Now when you in it, spit it
Notice that it's lava every time you get it
Rhyming by crimes committed,  knowing that you never did it
Fraudulent, phony fakers, look at all my homie's faces
Choke you with white laces, lawyers that beating cases
Rolling with smoking aces, watches and kinetic braces
Y'all niggas basic, I'm flying in the flyest spaceship
No time for wasting while I'm tryna crack this combination
No more procrastinating, I know y'all all been waiting
Often been imitated, but never duplicated
Pharaohs and genuine article that has never faded
Underpromised, overdelivered everything that we slayed
On the real though? I'm happy all my niggas made it
Watson and Holmes plus one third of the Czar
I murder you all, Apocalypse Now like Robert Duvall
Please don't hold your breath while you waiting for us to fall
You just an actress while I stand Galactus tall

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
Yo, I earned the title of most homicidal rapper upon arrival
I bomb the battles, strong as the rhino
You're boring like a long recital
I'm exciting like watching a tiger maul a politician
My word is bond, it's final, listen to precision
You be spitting verses in my face
Thinking that's a sound decision
Like you turning down the bass
I'm a pyromaniac, my rap's burning down the place
My plan: to put you in a crypt that's word to Outerspace Crypt
[?] and presents - that means I'm super gifted
You can hear the track and tell we futuristic
By the way the Stu had flipped a banger after banger
My anger, I can't retain, my lane is Bruce Banner
I'm reacting to the game
I can body a verse or put your body in bags
My hands'll beat that eye puffy like an Arctic attack
Blacastan and Eso, damn it's special, every line we spit
Designer shit, rhyming with a psycho killer's manifesto

[Verse 3: Esoteric]
Ralphie on my back, Forces on my feet
Bars come at the mouth leaving bodies in the street
Yo, I torture every beat like Chinese water
I'm that type of slaughter, AOTP
Bloody murder on your tape recorder
Pugilistic, you too simplistic while we brutal with it
Step in the arena, get crushed, you think that Guru spitted
The ruler with it, spit a verse in the throne
In the zone you fronting money like a personal loan

[Verse 4: Blacastan]
Invading your homes, the missiles attached to miniature drones
Straight to the dome
Blac-O-Teric on a case with pens, stitches and [?]
Specs they shoot lasers, Blade Runners and mazes, yup
And spit a hundred, since they had small faces
Beat cops that chase us, we won't stop but taze us
Two superheros who marvelously amaze
Spitting bars for days that have you spinning like waves
