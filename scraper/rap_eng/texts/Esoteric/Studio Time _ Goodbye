[Intro]
Let's go to war i weave and bob cats like I'm okafor
Striking frames like a bowling score
I'll drag you to the ocean floor
You're claimin' that your throat is sore
MY style...yo, bring the shit back

[Verse 1]
Guess who's in the lab again? Seamus with a battle rhyme
A product of a scattered mind, will it ever end?
He's soundin' kinda assinine, battle ten men at a time
All of them imaginary this I can't defend
Seamus had a few battles he won 'em of course
But nothing he ever did got him on the front of The Source
So he's thinking of just quitting this rhyming thing
And just giving this diamond ring for his girl to marry gim
But would the money carry 'em?
Soul purpose sales, dangerous connection sales
A new dope and DC2, split in half with 7L
Who's on another mission so he had to fill the position
Just temporarily his name is indie solo "my man"
I got no photo but he tours a lot, records a lot
He makes beats and sounds like Harrison Ford when he speaks
"That's so, ahhh, true" what can we do?
He's good for Seamus too 'cuz Seamus is feeling blue
His dog is sick and old an arthritically stricken soul
And that's his real buddy, can't be replaced with no type of money
He's on his last days, last legs, doesn't ask, doesn't beg
And shay be goin' through it in the head
Mentally he's stuck, he just can't escape this creative rut
He doesn't give a fuck, to him I say good luck...

[Verse 2]
Alright verse 2 yo the mic's like a .38
I'll send you to the pearly gates
You rap but never come off like hurley's weight
That's the fat dude from Lost, Jorge Garcia
You ain't a baller on revere beach with a kia
My styles

[Inter-verse interlude]
Esoteric: You know, forget it
Indie Solo: Good
Eso: What do you mean good?
Indie: You've got no vision
Eso: I'll be back
Indie: None at all
Eso: Man I -
Indie: You can't see
Eso: I, I got stuff -
Indie: Anyone without vision has no place here
Eso: Indie listen man I-I'll be back, my head is cluttered man. I got something, I don't wanna do, but somethin I have to do, alright?
Indie: Whats that?
Eso: It's my dog man

[Verse 2 cont'd]
I don't know how I'm gonna tell ya Max
You're like my best friend, it shouldn't have to end
Like this, here's your ball I know you like this
And even though I know you're too old to fight this
Here's your favorite treat
The first time in 15 long ears you don't wanna eat
Come on Max, one last run in the park
We'll make it a walk, I know its tough to see in the dark
You ol' crazy dog, life your head up for a sec
I'll be gentle, lemme take this collar from your neck
I'll watch it til you get back
And rub your belly while you take this extended nap
I know you can see me through those cataracts
I hope you can hear me through them shaggy flaps
You were so strong for so long
A little spoiled though, drinking out that toilet bowl
You're a good boy, coming in dirty from the beach
Messin up my seats, hogging all the bed sheets
How can I live without you? All my stories are about you
For every treat you traced, every car you chased
Every toy you ate, every bathroom break
In the subzero weather
No one gets out alive, no one lives forever (it's true)
Since that day I found you, I've built my life around you
I ain't ready, to see these vets surround you
I hope you understand this is for the best
I'll see you soon Max
