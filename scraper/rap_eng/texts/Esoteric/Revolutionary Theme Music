[Verse 1: Esoteric]
Once again we back, DC on the track
ECA got the bat, E.S. be that cat
The Alpha Dome, alphamale
The Great Dane looking down on you
It's my mic, my will, fuck a Jesse Helms
I'm at the helm y'all, look
Democrats, Republicans they all crooks
Shook, like they hands in the public eye
Outrage, backstage they all be buddy-buddy
Love each [?], trynna get that bloody money
Our rap was to punch it back to the state's Gene Tunney
Or should I say [?], this the season
Global warming puts north face outta, biz
I got a titanium brain, two chrome lungs
4000 reasons to rush, live long
Make him choke on his own tongue
His own fat, own blow
The motherfucker needs to get choked

[Hook: Scratching]
*Revolutionary music please*
*If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music*
*I been observant, I'll never be subservient*
*Die for the principle, stand for the cold*

[Verse 2: Main Flow]
I smash those, fluids everywhere the cash goes
Flash rose, tight rider while the brass blows
When I release [?] I keep a piece close
[?] most [?] make the Natti look East Coast
Compare idols, talking 'bout [?] bottles
Share lottos, philosophy like Aristotle
Somewhere the rally stand, I be out in Cali man
[?] secretary Clinton versus Taliban
Look what the [?] dealers trynna [?]
Ballparks, manifest all like Karl Marx
A little alliance to get a few clients
The critical giants the [?] political science
They have the fast dough, coming up last yo
The flash pro-black carcass meeting up with Castro
Staying [?] betray soft and play golf
Money like [?] when they made of

[Hook: Scratching]
*Revolutionary music please*
*If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music*
*I been observant, I'll never be subservient*
*It's documented, I'm in it, every day of the week*
*Revolutionary music please*
*If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music*
*I been observant, I'll never be subservient*
*Awaiting revolution like a renegade*

[Verse 3: King Magnetic]
Yo, I don't fit in a group, of a political soup
They taking minimal truth, making criminal loot
[?] off the roof like reindeer, it's unbelievable
Jesus, inconceivable, reasons, unretrievable
Seasons is freezing when they should have been warmer
Obama throw in word then I'm good on the corner
Rhyming barber following, [?] fathers
Programs that would cut, cross they longers
Motherfuckers better wake up, [?]
It made a joke of the government like [?]
Compare the [?], justice is the rarest thought
You think it's free but your P.D. prepared your loss
They work in the same building, exchange millions of civilians every day
Cage 'em and [?] billing 'em
[?], reveiling when their vision vanish
How do you make [?] living on the prison planet?
