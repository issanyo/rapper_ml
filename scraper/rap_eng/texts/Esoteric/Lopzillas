[Big John]
My life is priceless even with all the fuckin shysters
We label on ??? sippin coronas your ?????
I crush my opponents leaving them homeless
Give em jobs as promoters meet all my quotas
Selling records while ya’ll playing checkers
No sense in hiding out Eso told me grind it out
Big John ain’t no joke let em know what you about
The haters just can’t see you gotta show em how
I’m the guillotine king slicing head at the gallows
Bust a blade severe you’re legs I’m never afraid
My sixteen split spleen so I better get paid
I’m better with age dangerous like a pinless grenade
Blow up on the mic with this villainous rage
I’ve been in situations that’ll probably make you wanna die
Going on twenty five and the kid’s still alive
Fuck suicide it ruins lives not just man
So I gotta keep moving till they stop my talent

[Big John]
Eso!

[Esoteric]
Shatter anatomy ??? a ??? so rabidly
??? -???
It’s a pitbull rottweiler body compiler
Divine styler call me amygdala
Disfiguring your impala
My finger tips wanna holler
They pick up the good Kabbalah
Roll the Holy Bible I’m liable to blow em out their prada
I got the strength of Tony Atlas or Fat Joe’s mattress
Hurricane Agnes hit the streets like Logan and Magnus
Hit the mic like Wolverine and Magneto
And put it down for my Boston and Tacoma people
You can say I’m more than lethal
I throw you in the jaws river make your bones shiver
I deliver lyricism everything points to science
Rip your limbs off leave them in point defiance
We giants mind bending tyrants
E-S spit that crack call your clients

[Big John]
Hop in hella fuckin van

[Mic Daily]
With contraband stomp cross a land
Launch logic with a plan to expand
Learn first hand from the verse and
Realize the worth I put in perspective the earth
I feel like my mother on my day of birth
Focus like the way I work
Hocus pocus when I flip berserk
With the single dimple smirk
It’s so simple I exert the words
And assert myself as an expert
The network only getting bigger
Throw you in the green river make your soul shiver
I eat a serial killer the skoal spiller for real
Piece of mentally sadistic shit
Gorilla strange stance when I flip
Leave you rotten at the bottom of a cliff
Part and package your body as a gift
In an emergency ration case like Mr. Lif
Give your parents a present they’ll never forget
Severe and jet forever a threat
Clever intellect better than you detect
The weather’s calling for rain but that’s what I expect
Going all in on the game and I better collect

[Big John]
Beyonder
Let’s go!

[Beyonder]
Uh
Yo yo
You ain’t a spot rusher
Just a core bore scream a boar
I even the score and swords deepen the sore
You ain’t violent by design you a ?gee? to the core
You pussy by nature you get beat to the floor
I bust on the scene verbally murder your team
Every flow is obscene even if the version is clean
You shook like Borat at the Jewish BMB
I’m being me my pockets stay filled like the DMV
Fake gangsters thinking they been now
Cause they got a deal they making us bend now
Beyonder gots you I see through your poker face
Your flows a waste another head in my trophy case
Now that’s how you murder the verse
No need for a nurse money you the first in a hearse
What
