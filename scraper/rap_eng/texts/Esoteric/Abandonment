When the spoken words make less sense than those unspoken
And resentment is all that is left to give

Still we go through with the facade
Wasting our time humouring insanities

And know so well
Sense has no place here
Fire, running with abandonment
Until there's no place left to burn

Did those eyes drown?
Did the soul slip so far down it became lost?
Is the only spirit left, the one that passes the lips?

An age of destruction
I watch, my disbelief waiting for change

The will for resolution faded fast
And in the end, it stands for nothing, counts for nothing

Tis like a funeral march
Driving towards the death
Awaiting the vultures' call
