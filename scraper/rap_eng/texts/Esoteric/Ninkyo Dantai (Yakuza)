[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
My aura shine, a fourth design a fashionist
On another level, on another masterpiece
You can’t be a true force if you lacking heat
It can’t be a true song if it’s lacking me
Order is a physical reality
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head, think anatomy
Actually I am the second coming of the Maccabee
It's Saturday Night Live, y’all part of the casualties
Fractionally I improve power to y’all
I've ripped my heart out and moved mountains for y’all
I am God, I am every single fountain to y’all
Y’all {censored} here’s a flower for y’all

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
Got an extra clip on my hip so I can clip a hipster
School a schoolteacher, my finger intrigued with the trigger
Hit a lick, flip a brick for the right fee
Hotel concierge, I swipe keys
Sorry, but I got a fetish for cabbage
Got Obamacare fiends that got medicine habits
My mucus will mutilate
My phlegm flies and flattens you flapping flailing founders flipping off my dinner plate
Grizzly bear appetite, get the fraction right
Pay me more, my negotiation tool be an AT4
Leave lames in the morgue
Or dead bitch dissection getting brain from a whore

[Hook: Planetary]
You aim, you gotta shoot, the squad be cannon-proof
Whole clique's insane, spit flames right out the booth
Playing field's locked 'cause the Army’s back in
Underground king shit ever since back then
You aim, you gotta shoot, the squad be cannon-proof
Whole clique's insane, spit flames right out the booth
Playing field's locked 'cause the Army’s back in
Underground king shit ever since back then

[Verse 3: Blacastan]
In death reborn, we disassemble and reform
Shatter the status quo, breaking the norm
Elevating to a newer height
Getting higher than the gas price
It's Metroid, flip the game with one life
Spit shells that'll pierce through any vest
I'm a gamer that's trapped in an NES
I escape when they press reset
This life is too short, I play hard, no regrets
I spend hours on a console chain smoking cigarettes
Back before internet
In the days of dual tape cassettes
Magnifiers melting all insects

[Verse 4: Apathy]
You better run for the hills, got a tongue full of pills
And a brain full of pain and a lung full of quills
With the poisonous tip all your boys will be hit
I’m destroying this shit, I’m steroids when I spit
You would jump into the void to avoid my clique
I’m paranoid and sick, I'm Perestroika bitch
Here to save what the faggot rappers put in the grave
Cassette deck in my chest I'm harder than Soundwave
The bold and the brave I would rather be cold in a cave
Hiding out than be sold like a slave
Name embroiled and engraved on an old gold blade
Be afraid we could raid, foes homes you get slain

[Hook: Planetary]
You aim, you gotta shoot, the squad be cannon-proof
Whole clique's insane, spit flames right out the booth
Playing field's locked 'cause the Army’s back in
Underground king shit ever since back then
You aim, you gotta shoot, the squad be cannon-proof
Whole clique's insane, spit flames right out the booth
Playing field's locked 'cause the Army’s back in
Underground king shit ever since back then

[Verse 5: Esoteric]
(I accept your surrender, yo)
I’m known to behead a competitor, machete a predator
With the pen I black out like a Ebony editor
I’ve been deading rappers since Kennedy was a senator
Ryan said 'em with obscenities my pen's the offender
I'm underhand to a black market, dismember a rap artist
Sell meth to Damien, hearse don't play me for a verse
Pay me for protection, I’ll mangle them in a session
I'll strangle them with a weapon, I dangle them from a ledge
An orangutan with a TEC and I’m aiming, it’s my profession
I put ‘em in a box, rectangular dimensions
A coffin so I can bury 'em off in a cemetery
And talk like a barbarian, cut 'em like a Cesarean

[Verse 6: Planetary]
Bonny and Clyde shit with the lady at Pompeii
Paparazzi on me, got me feeling like Kanye
Shoot past the camera, fly north to Canada
Samurai sword first class for the massacre
Behold the legend, beheading rappers in seconds
I'm deading half of your henchmen
The rest I'm bashing with weapons
Stop asking the question, the Army coming
Hand grenades invade your party, Dem or Republican
Shoving faces in ovens
Hear the bass? It's thumping
Outerspace is outlaw, outlining your stomach
Outshining the public, out rhyming and hustling
You out your damn mind, doubting you can’t fuck with it
