They look through their rose-coloured glasses
At the beauty of the world
They're so blind and fucking ignorant
That love's all they see
Any sorrow they come across never cuts deep
Because real pain is what ignorance can't feel
It just runs shallow through their pretentious world

Never looking into themselves
They adopt the feelings of somebody else
Never stopping to think who they are
Or what life is
They become what society expects them to be

I stare back at these people who stare at me
They laugh through their vanity, so ignorant
They can't begin to realise that my mind is free
My hateful wisdom destroys them, relieving my pain
For their souls will be banished to forever live in ignorance

Those who laugh at philosophies they know nothing of
Are those who mostly disgust me
And I shall be avenged, through the power of Satan anarchy

Satanism isn't fantasy; it is based on the philosophies of life
Comparable to man's basic instincts
Now laugh if you please

There is no such thing as nothing:

(Music - Simon. 11/1992)
