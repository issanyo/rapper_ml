The psycho-analyst is lookin at me like I'm a crackpot

"From the rude attitude, done got in it to win it"

Okay, now tell me a little bit about your education
I didn't breeze through school, well actually I did
I breezed through the campus center back to my crib
You like to socialize? - Yeah - Well that's no surprise
Plus it's somethin that a lunatic mostly denies
Chill, whatchu tryin to say, that I'm about to explode?

Well it goes without saying like old folks, continue

How do you feel about this exam? I think it's bullshit!

{*7L scratching*}
"Well, well, well! I'll be damned"
"Say what?" - "is the word" - "I don't know"
"Like I.. like I said before.."
"Listen up as I take out the rhyme book"
"I'm dead serious and I won't fess it.."
".. but chill 'til I finish the third verse"
"Now, listen-listen to the past"

This is going well, tell me a little about uhh, Metzer

[Esoteric]
The punk stand front and center
Red carpets roll, ladies trumpet as they enter
Light years beyond, my title's number one contender
Mind of an inventor with the grace of a fencer
Look, I gives a fuck if you're white, black or octaroon
I'll lock you in a room, make you pop balloons
Filled with toxic fumes, yeah you shoulda bought a tomb
Cause Esoteric puts the Metal to your Face like Dr. Doom

Is-is that true? - Nah but it's a hot rhyme
Just give me a word, I'll say what pops to my mind
Okay cell - phone or prison? Esoteric - vocalism
Freestyle - old tradition, Mass Ave. - Pole Position
