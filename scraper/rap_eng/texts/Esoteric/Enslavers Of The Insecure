"He that is slow to believe anything and everything is of
Great understanding, for belief in one false principle is
The beginning of all unwisdom."

Slavery:
Followers of the right-hand path
Looking to God for comfort
Enslaved by his command
Controlled by priests and bishops

Conceited are the followers who preach unto others
Not to follow is to burn in Hell
Spreading lies about Satanism, to enslave the minds of sinners

Propaganda spread - mass control
Pay to repent - money for their pleasure
Brainwashing the weak in mind
If God is good, why should you fear him?

All they want is the feeling of power
Of having others follow their morals
All they bring is pain and fear to the ones who are unsure

Kill these enslavers
They only want to rule and judge you to satisfy their narrow minds
Satanism is a way of life
It is to do whatever will please you
There are no commandments just follow you instincts
Never bow down to the lambs of God

Question the why and wherefore of their commandments
Why should they be true?
Man's instincts go against self-denial
Instincts of indulgence and self-preservation should come through

"There is no heaven of glory bright and no hell where sinners roast
Here and now is our day of torment. Here and now is our day of joy."
