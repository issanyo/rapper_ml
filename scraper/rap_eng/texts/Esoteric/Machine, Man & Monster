[Intro: Conway]
Yeah
You know what the fuck it is nigga
Machine nigga
Czarface nigga
Yo, Uh, Uh
Look (look) Look (Look)


[Verse 1: Conway]
Look
Catch you at the red light (nigga)
Pop you in the head twice
In the hood playing cee-lo with the red dice (look)
Free my nigga doing fed life
Cross the mall get your shin broke
Factory rims on the Benz, woah
We all eating none of my friends broke
Fuckboy get outta pocket Mac-10 smoke (look)
Sell the drop let the brick fly
Whip it, sit it on a napkin let the shit dry
Remember spraying up the block while my bitch drive
My youngin my killer is in my gen, aye
East side nigga we don't let shit slide
If we can’t get to you then your bitch die
Niggas know how I do it
Go head play stupid pussy nigga you gon leak fluid

[Interlude]
Well I get it I say
Yeah turn me up some
Well I get it I say
In another part of the city at that certain brownstone we find

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
I take that pistol they holding
Put that shit to they dome and
Look at this as an omen
You hear that click now get going
When that pictures in motion
You feel that sinister joke and
You think I resurrect the Heath then hire Christopher Nolan
I just keep the whip clean like an Uber driver
Rappers fall back like a SCUBA diver
Who's live-r, Larry when I talk trash
Walk away finger up drained it off glass
Class is in session, peasants kneel
Heavy record got the feel of the seventh seal
Heavy sketch like a Bill Sienkiewicz steel
Heavy swing like Jackie on Ebbets Field
Used to ride flow had a low sale
Flipped for the children on my coattails
Bars locked it down like there’s no bail
My words make a mark like I wrote braille

[Interlude]
(Record scratching)
Well I get it II say
Turn me up some
Yeah
Meanwhile a few blocks away

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
They say you don’t love it
If you can’t leave it in a heart beat
Cash is king I’m snatching everything in arms reach
Pardon me, y’all in my way
Say it’s all about the Benjamins and women friends
Call it a day
It’s the feeling like the best sex ever
Roll your eyes back
Moment you come down to earth you need that high back
I been there, rainy days, eighth of the haze
Ran the route, caught the ball, that the play of the game
See my young g's falling trying to play it the same
Get money, catch a body how you making your name
Shame
Loyalty is for those who did the bid with me
Take care of my wife and my kids if, they dare get me
Models and bottles on the wake up
Straight face, no makeup
I catch back pains holding my weight up, straight up
Put them on hold cause the paper calling
Full time with the grind keep a hater talking

[Outro]

Well I get it I say
Yeah, yeah yeah
Wassup
This is what it is like (yeah, alright)
