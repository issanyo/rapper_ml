[Verse 1: Esoteric]
It’s the rise of the rebel, story of an MC
Glory evidently, don’t tempt me
Yo, my first contact with this music
Was fifth grade when the biggest threat was a switchblade
Noble, for real, Jordan was still
A Tarheel at NC, when I first thought I’d MC
Dwelling in the Bean before Preem
Seldom heard, I was rarely seen
Travelling between Bev and Dorchester
Each semester of my life
For as long as I remember was trife
Living on the cutting edge of a knife
Busy making bars, tapes and pasting odd breaks
To butt heads with the mic
First time on stage, duke, I was rocking grey troops
Next show I had Cuccini shirts and a beige suit
I used to have high top with lines in my head
Now I, ride the train with these lines in my head
I no longer have time for this bullshit
The politic dug six smiling at cats
I wouldn’t even wanna fuck with
On the personal B.I. tip or friendship
They’re reversible and two-faced
Shady like a cash-filled suitcase
”Fuck y’all” leaves my mouth quicker than the taste of toothpaste
One of the illest this sport's seen
The only way I’m going peacefully is with morphine

[Hook: Esoteric] (x2)
It’s the rise of the rebel, story of an MC
Glory evidently, don’t tempt me
Yo you living life, shit is trife
A little tyke, growing up that wanna spit on a mic
Get it right

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
Yo, let me set it straight for people that show love
And people that show hate, my life’s far from great
My folks far from rich, a message to the kids
Think for yourself, don’t believe a gossiping bitch
See I know you gotta teach to keep kids in the seats
But rap ain’t a tool to put my fam’s biz in the streets
And I, don’t know why I spit this arrogant shit
When most my life is filled up with embarrassing shit
I don’t walk around crying cause my parents is split
They ain’t had hella kids, I don’t know no relatives
I ain’t got no type of cash, but y’all think I do
Cause I flash, and spend it on superficial trash
My 25th hour just never seems to pass
So it’s only right I live each day like it’s my last
This is for the cats that heard the flow
And got the background twisted like vertigo
And yo

[Hook] (x2)
