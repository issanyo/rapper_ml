Def man
It's that time again

[Verse 1: Esoteric]
Yo yo
Why you frontin' dog? I'm not impressed
Fuck your little logo let me get it off my chest
You walk around in a cardigan vest
Like you some type of artist just how you dress (please)
And that's cool but give it a rest
It's Monday here, not Friday at South by Southwest
Yeah we get it you're bored (listen)
Just smile when we walk in the door
Selling t-shirts it's ok to love it
You're my cashier don't act like you're above it (nope)
How do I put up with ya'll?
Sunglasses at night hood up in the mall
And I don't know any men, who spend time talkin' bout how Japanese denim bend (nope)
Then again they jump on any trend, is there any end to the way they condescend? (Nahh)
Nope, there's just too fly
But I'll take a size 12 and ah, lace 'em up cool guy

[Hook]
Nikes, nikes things that I like
But I bet I got to buy 'em off this asshole, right?
My nikes I like, yo I like my nikes
You suckas are sonic

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
Look I know what you're doing is trendy
But this is *cough* not Gucci or Fendi
So be a little friendly on the real man
You're not a fashion icon you're a salesman (sorry)
You're not a rapper or DJ wait you probably are
You got the illest tapes and you spit the hottest bars
And you're in a punk band too
I'm sure tell me what else you're gonna do
With your boutique if I wasn't making music I would speak a diss that would be a little more complete
But I like having heads with no class
They call it high end denim cause it's riding up yo ass
Nikes behind glass like an Armani suit
You know I could have got the stupid shit at Karmaloop
Online with a click of a button but I came in here and you frontin'
Actin' like your dog died or somethin'
I mean what did I expect?
Stupid shit around your neck and some black framed specs
Talkin' rap rap rap
How you gonna get *cough* to spit crack for a snapback hat?
Please, be cautious of the guy in exclusive collages and a variety of watches
How obnoxious and pretentious that why I don't fuck wit 'em
Good luck with 'em

[Hook]
Nikes, nikes things that I like
But I bet I got to buy 'em off this asshole, right?
My nikes I like, yo I like my nikes
You suckas are sonic

[Esoteric talking]
Yo yo yo I want to shout out all the companies that yaknaI'msayin' don't act like dicks when you come in the store...
Uh uh, wait

The music has not stopped yet
