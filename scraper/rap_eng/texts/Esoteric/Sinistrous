Sullen, I loom forth into the microcosm
Exuberant voices abound
I hear their scrapings of life
Falling, into infinity

Knowledge is understanding
And not truth
Truth is the myth that mocks us
Verification, the addendum of nothing
Paradoxical irony

The fools, content to live as numbers
What is it, that holds their attention
So far from the innate questioning?
Where do they live?
The infinity of wisdom could not scour
The shit from their eyes

.... Their will, sold for security ....

This world, bathed in the filth of stupidity
Retarded humans, etching out their predetermined frameworks
Created as a pathetic excuse for the unfounded purpose

.... My disconsolateness reigns supreme ....

For mine shall be hidden
I speak so that time may know I have spoken
And not so that time is lost within my speech

.... Throughout the silence, I nurture the unspoken words ....

Intransigent predator
Look to your numbers .... And you shall be my prey!

[Music - Simon, 1995 / 96]
