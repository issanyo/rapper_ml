Bereft promises made unto me
I always remember watching them fade
Upon winds of blackened torment
The promises' I couldn't see
For they are just words
And your words are empty

Lies, Lies:

"Ilasa micalazoda olapireta ialpereji beliore: das odo
Busadire Oiad ouoresa caosago: casaremeji Laiada eranu
Berinutasa cafafame das ivemeda aqoso adoho Moz, od
Maofasa. Bolape como belioreta pamebeta. Zodocare od
Zodameranu! Odo cicale Qaa. Zodoreje, lape zodiredo Noco
Mada, hoathahe Saitan!"

Lies are all humanity knows
For if they spoke truth it would show
That they are nothing but a shadow of each other

Confusion and lies engulf me
The bastard humans disgust me
I scream alone in the mountains, venting my hate
Calling forth emptiness to surround me
So that I may see clearly with my mind
The words they use to try to blind me

I can see
No one keeps their promises
No one ever cares
And neither do I anymore
Humanities demise is what I lust for
