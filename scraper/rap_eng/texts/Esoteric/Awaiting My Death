Windows of shattered dreams
Laid out before me
My broken reflection hauntingly stares back
As once again I pick up the pieces of my mind

Rebuilding myself again
And I know what is done
The smaller pieces lost
They used to be large
But now they are gone

I cannot find my hope, my joy or my life
Just empty splinters embedded in my mind
Causing me pain, I grimace in awe at the overwhelming pain
Caused by what I've lost, by what has been destroyed

My scars start to bleed
From my wounds of sorrow
I watch the blood run
A release of my self-hate
And still the blood flows:

Scarred all over my body
With each scar comes a memory of pain
Though it's hard to tell now, they all look the same
Awaiting the day when my blood is no more
Maybe then the pain will be gone
I await my death with both relief and with fear
I sense that my shattered mind knows it is near
