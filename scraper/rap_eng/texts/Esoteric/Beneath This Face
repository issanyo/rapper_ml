Lies a broken man
Festering inside
Shades of light pass through this room
And remind me
There was once a world
Outside of this stricken maze

Only instincts drives on
And life
Our great teacher
Teaches all

Passing through this fetid ship
With sickened feeling of what lies within
Sporadic thought, spawning its messy web of insanity
Living from the heart and breath alone

For emotions determine all that is lost and won here
And all that is dear
Taken, by wind and time

How many times in a lifetime must we break?
And have such a need to be strong?

So tired of this feeling
Of fighting and living
Wrought so completely with pain

Nothing remains...
But a restless longing for death
Hidden, beneath this face
