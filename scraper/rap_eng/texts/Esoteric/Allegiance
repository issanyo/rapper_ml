My destitute life I owe to no one
I reside alone in the darkness
Staring out from the blackened walls of my mind
Tormented through knowledge,unshackled by wisdom
I attain autonomy

Bound to no mortal
Unable to trust in this world built upon lies
I take what I desire,I adhere to no laws

In allegiance with darkness
The darkness within myself
The dark force of the earth

My understanding now vast
I have devoted years of isolation
To thought,to knowledge
So that I may see for myself
With my own mind!
My empiricist ways have seen power by my own hand!

As the night stalk's revenge
The moon is culling for blood,so will it be!
This soulless light
Shall feel the pain of my suffering

I suffer alone,in the darkness
My serpentine mind,screams in delight
As my cries echo through the pathways of my mind
All goes still
Rationale complete
Chaos shatters my sentient thought
My pain is endless,as will be yours!

I will kill your purity
I will purge your innocence
As I walk in disgust
Into each vacant eye I stare
My head hangs low in sorrow

For so few see through the haze of this reality
So very few attain their desire
In allegiance......
