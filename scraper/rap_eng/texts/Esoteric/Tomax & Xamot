[Intro]
Introducing the leaders of the Crimson Guard
The evil twin brothers Tomax and Xamot
*The Gods*
*Enter in the realm*
*Xamot, Tomax*

[Verse 1: Apathy & Esoteric]
Welcome to the terror drone, laboratory full of clones
Battle Storm's shadow and shatter his fragile bones

That I condone, I spit it with a dastardly tone
Chrome gats get blown, no you can't inhabit the zone

Back from the swampland, face camouflage like Zartan
On four wheels, is she real in a retinal scans

Wrecking your plans, call your medicine man
We the evilest twins, roll through on his tanks with rims

Snatching limbs outta timbs, three, two, one
Diabolical separating dictator's molecules
To create a leader that's unstoppable

Highly logical rhyme agenda Dr. Mind Bender lies ender Tomax and Xamot
Spray blocks you can't enter
[?]
And metamorphosizes
For many more surprises

The masters of disguises
We slip through the cracks, attacks and hack systems
Slap and hack victims up, Ap inflicts 'em
With poison deployed like venom when I scream (cobralalalalalalalala)
To summon my team, it goes
D, E, M, I, G, O, D, Z
Got a posse that's hard as the Crimson Guard be

[Hook]
*The science of the future is the Gods*
*The science of the future is the Gods*
*The science of the future is the Gods*
*Cause ain't no Gods that will put you out your misery*

[Verse 2: Apathy & Esoteric]
Ayo we think alike speak alike, thoughts travel at the speed of light
Read and write the same and stand at an even height
And G.I., being our B.I., we don't believe the hype
Freedom fighters kneel down down to the evil type

The ice-cold arctic flow, my arsenal grows
Armed with arsenic tipped arrows and crossbows
Froze, bodies of Joes, extract their souls

We just tag em with the Mac never tag their toes
We leave 'em Red (uh), Fred (uh), Duke (uh), Dead

Aquatic amphibious tanks roll through cities
With cannons aimed at enemies, bombing 'em biochemically

The energy from our weaponry tends to be epidemically
Fatal the brief case of the table let's do biz
We moving missiles and guns, employing prisoner's sons

The Battle Android Trooper that stunts
With a phaser attached, fatal attacks
We pack, lasers and gats

Amazing acts, leave your database and face cracked

I made your blood with a layer of mud
From the swamps that I stomp with dreadnoughts and thugs

I'm firefly with a light-green submachine gun
We be like Tomax and Xamot watch your team run

[Hook]
