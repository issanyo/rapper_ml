[7L talking]
As we come to a close, Dangerous Connection
7L is the DJ (check) and the MC (yo)
Tell 'em your name son

[Verse 1: Esoteric]
It's the E-S, take a deep breath, beat death
Vocals eat flesh, like mesh
Putting holes up in your weak chest
Your gotta check this
I take your necklace, leave you neckless
Respect this, it's back to the basics
I come through in an A-6
You come through in Asics
Not the real ones, the fake shits
I didn't know they made 'em
You couldn't spit a def rhyme if you spit my verbatim
Cadillac frank with the baddest bank, lately
All I do is rip crews, sip booze and hit snooze
Fuck around with this and catch a quick bruise
You make about as much sense spitting your venom
As a cotton sweatshirt that says, "Nautica denim"
Fuck battlin' cats I'm Jim Abbottin' cats
Which means singlehandedly, I'm embarassin' cats

[7L talking]
And it's like that, banging beats and dope rhymes
Ay yo, shay, hit 'em off one more time
(yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
I'm rapping in a certain way, crack your vertebrae
And spitting sweet sixteens like it's your birthday
I blow green like Jimmy Cliff, but never hit the spliff
The shit I spit'll put ya whip in a fit
Straight airing out cats like doormats
I've been underground as long, as these civil war cats
My closet, looks like I have five brothers
Cause everything I have, yo I have in five colors
Raps impair ya brain, clear the lane
My diamond aeroplane'll put the fear in the game
Got the deafest cats out there hearin' my name
Rocking raincoats, too nice to wear in the rain
I crack your commercial raps over your head
Now your One Twelve got a Jagged Edge
You sound wack if Marley Marl produced you
And our business is chews crew, it's new school

[Esoteric talking]
Word up
Yo 7L, take us the fuck outta here

[Outro sample]
I'm the one that does the rocking, all my sounds are legit
