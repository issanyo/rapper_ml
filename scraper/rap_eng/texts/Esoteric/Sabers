[Hook]
Moving around, moving around
Moving around, can't fall
Moving around, moving around
Moving around, can't fall

[Verse 1: Inspectah Duck]
I bring an end to the weak, call me Saturday
Fast as Cassius Clay
I put your favorite rapper head in a glass display
I'm at the cabaret
Sitting with the baddest bitch sipping Cabernet
Nah, I didn't have to pay
Never trick for a treat, not even on Halloween
Fuck your Twitter, FB, and IG, I follow green
See the flow stay fogging your lens
Your boy like a paranoid jewel thief dropping 'em gems
Yeah, me and Eso like Deadpool and Spider-Man
We combined make a marvel at the fire jams
Try us, fam, you find yourself in a frying pan
We get your food regulated like a diet plan
Poisonous pen play, your sensei
Spitting this on a Wu Wednesday for 10K
My game's still a-wild, double up the pain now
The haters, they feel some type of way now

[Hook]
Moving around, moving around
Moving around, can't fall
Moving around, moving around
Moving around, can't fall

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
100 proof, I'm a wolf, Harvey Keitel
You out fronting about nothing like Seinfeld
I stay killing like Wade Wilson with nine's help
I spear with gravity, that'll be how the rhymes felt
It feels like a Vulcan mind melt with Liefeld
The new mutant is true to shooting, no dry spell
Make 'em all shake in their boots
Like strippers who making their loot
Amazing the brains, these rappers hate me, but praise me
So I'm kind of like Laettner and Duke
FN-2187 on you fake and that's true
Basically making me puke
Hank Pym, that's him, that's how his brain compute
CZARFACE equals so much more than the name of a group
We're talking vibranium shoes, weapons, Iranian nukes
Jedi [?] tripping save us flipping, they training with Luke
Ever since me and Deck been on that buddy-buddy shit
Shit been ugly, but it does the trick like Steph Curry kicks

[Hook]
Moving around, moving around
Moving around, can't fall
Moving around, moving around
Moving around, can't fall
