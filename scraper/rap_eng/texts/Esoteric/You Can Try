[Intro: Apathy]
Yeah, Apathetic, Esoteric, Demigodz baby
Molemen with His-Panik
Yo, Yo, Yo

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I throw the mic at your breastbone; leave your whole chest blown
Ap’s puttin’ tired old rappers in rest homes
As far as battlin’, I’m probably the best known
To leave you on the operatin’ table gettin’ flesh sewn
You wanna throw fists? Then we can get it on
‘Cause me and you wack emcees will never get along
Sometimes I hates [?“The Scope”?] for makin’ that song
‘Cause now even fat girls think they’re sexy in a thong
What the fuck went wrong? There’s a whole mess a crews
And I’mma kick your fuckin’ ass like Bow-Legged Lou
Your whole claim to fame is ridin’ my dick
Like your name was Dana Dane and my name Slick Rick
And yo I only stick chicks if the bitches are thick
The sickest to spit, my whole clique’s vicious as shit
And the reason why my crew will never pass the mic
It’s ‘Cause it’s see-though like ice in a glass a Sprite
Yeah, Ap is tight

[Chorus:]
You can try but you’ll never ever be this hot
Representin’ like what… Demigodz
You can try but you’ll never ever be this hot
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You can try but you’ll never ever be this hot
Demigodz… representin’ like what
You can try but you’ll never ever be this hot
Representin’ like what

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
It’s the pterodactyl swoopin’ in on this track
And yo it’s like that, we strike bat like spinal taps
Cats prime up wax for five attacks up on vinyl racks
The finest cats don’t accept my rhyme attacks
Now when I’m at bat, I spit raw with intuition
We rock spots like a skin condition
I’m in position while you in submission
My rap broke the backs of cats with golden plaques
Now onto openin’ acts; my flow attacks
Smacks through soft tracks and [?s]
Sent ‘em back, with their bags packed into shrink wrap
Is Esoteric nice? When it comes to open mics
I’ll blow your whole device then be ghost like Poltergiest
But when it comes to life, yo I takes my own advice
‘Cause fake guys role snake eyes like loaded dice
Ya clique a’int straight, I can tell from the gate
You a dead giveaway like a slain rapper’s demo tape

[Chorus]
You can try but you’ll never ever be this hot
Representin’ like what
You can try but you’ll never ever be this hot
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You can try but you’ll never ever be this hot
Demigodz
You can try but you’ll never ever be this hot
Representin’ like what

[Verse 3: Apathy (Esoteric)]
I got a dark desire to spark the fire
Swing bats at cats like I’m raps Mark McGwire
Our names headlinin’ the flier ‘til we retire
Fuckin’ bitches flyer than Mia, Mariah, and Tyra
We don’t know our own strength, so just horsin’ around
I could be forcin’ you down, or put your corpse in the ground
Tryin’ to find blazin’ raps, but most ya lame tracks
Is like tryin’ to find a fuckin’ needle inside a haystack
Yo my rhyme style’s doper than prescription drugs
Mixed in chemical tubs by thugs with orange gloves
Plus its doper than that shit that’s gettin’ slipped in clubs
Once it gets within’ their blood, It’ll make woman bug
While you always screamin’ peace, we’ll leave ya crews deceased
Plus our new release spins wax back like Judas Priest
If Ap says you wack it ain’t far from the truth
And if Eso’s spittin’ vocals stay far from the booth
Yo when we combine with Panik, rappers try to ban it
At first they knew the deal now they can’t understand it

[Outro:]
You can try but you’ll never ever be this hot
Representin’ like what
You can try but you’ll never ever be this hot
