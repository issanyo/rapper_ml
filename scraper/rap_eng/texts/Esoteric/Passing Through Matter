Passing through matter
I tear onwards
Bitterness empowers my will
Darkness permeates the living tissues of my flesh
As I surround.....

Chaos revels in my mind
Celebrate the destruction
Scorn the travesty of times.....
....Such times of nonchalance

The unforeseen tragedies shall be a monument
To my will
For they shall be as non-being
Engulfed by the strength of past

Have I not laughed when it did come?
Devoured the pain
Now it is mine
To wield,to bestow
The fuel of my acumen

Not of woman born, Are we
But of pain and anger
The feisty depths of passion
To which mortals could only fear

As Lucifer,we were not cast down
We each took our own kingdom......

Nothing is so endearing to behold
As the fortitude of will
In it's merciless cascade.....
.....To satiate the dreams of mortals.....

Invoke the zenith of transcendence
Dressed in oratory skills
Tear asunder the volition
Power,in it's purest form
A storm to the testimony of time......!
