[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
INS Your Highness
Wu Tang, 7L
Eso, let's Go

[Verse One: Inspectah Deck]
Bustin' ain't nothin' to us
I spit game like a sportscaster
Cousin is crushed, you're lovin' the rush
Beast mode, animal house, straight off the intro
Sit back and watch a cool G rap, this is a demo
Menace with the methods, no sweeteners diabetic
Phys Ed raps, stretchin' 'em out, like calisthenics
Set it
Get wounded in the war like "MEDIC!"
No anesthetic, thus no medals for your effort
Fuckin' with this lyrical X pill, the vet's still a threat
He'll never defect, still I'm Destiny's Child
They Calling My Name
Come through, raw with the flame
Whoever want it get more of the same
Hold 'em scoreless, call it a game
All day, Sir I, get fly like I'm boarding a plane
Hard lines like the rhymes carved in stone
As far as the throne, see me anywhere
I'm not far from home

[Hook: Esoteric]
No matter how far we roam
We never that-that-that-th-that
Far from home
And we be right ba-ba-ba-ba-back
Guard your zone
We legendary like Guru and Preme
Don't you see what I mean?
No matter how far we roam
We never that-that-that-th-that
Far from home
And we be right ba-ba-ba-ba-back
Guard your zone
We legendary like Marley and Kane
Don't you see what I'm sayin'?

[Verse Two: Esoteric]:
It's time to rumble with rebels
We rough and tumble and ready
We come up humble and steady
But flows are Money like Eddie
We blow your brains to spaghetti
Your lyric book to confetti
I'm fresher
You flow like the male version of Ke$ha
You're watchin' history happen like Jackie Robinson battin'
Or archeologists mappin' a path to fossils
Imagine Apache choppers attackin'
You rappers softer than satin
The beat is knockin', it's crackin'
Yo, this is Boston and Staten
While y'all be talkin' like a felon
Like you hoppin' out of cell and
While y'all be straight pussy like the opposite of Ellen
I'm Macaveli rebellin'
I'm Martinelli, I'm clearer
I'm Fonzarelli in leather
You Nas in Belly, an actor
You unintelligent rapper
You barely relevant factor
The hell that I'm propelling at ya
You can't develop or capture
Your skeleton will get fractured
I'll break every single bone
Esoteric's international but never far from home

[Hook]
