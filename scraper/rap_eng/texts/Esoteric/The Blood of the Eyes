I have not seen myself for ages
This empty shell cares no longer for life
Slowly replacing the flesh with steel
So that I may carry on...
Unfettered by this mortality

The air no longer carries favour
The water that passes these lips
Keeps only this mortal shell alive

For hope has been not here
Nor raised in it's form

And all is lost again
Eradicate the shadows, That dements these thoughts
And if I were to enter slumber?
Only sleep, guarded by a sense I may never wake
Slipping into narcoleptic state

Seas of tormented bliss
Ebb away from these barren shores

Nothing remains

Only pieces of this intimate jigsaw

...And 'tis upon me again

The clock ticks on
And still I remain
Death wrenched upon my eyes
To the birth of a second sight

Visions surround
The haze of my labyrinth
Angles of dimensions unreal, unseen

Blood, in the deep of my eyes
Fires within the mountain

'Tis within my grasp
The point that will shall eventually reach
And shall have no return
