[Hook: Esoteric]
No time to sleep kid, no time to snooze
No time to lose, they want to keep us confused
We ain't fucking with it, y'all [?]
*Only describe us as soldier survivors*

[Verse 1: Esoteric]
It's [?] anyway, Big Brother can take a break
Keep [?] and a diamond on ourselves for status updates
No whereabout, volunteering our whereabouts
To the military state, clear 'em out
Tear 'em out the frame
It ain't the same I wanna break the chains and go
MIA but them jets ain't paper planes
And while y'all fight about who ever heard it first
I 'ma murder this verse
Wanna build? I'm a steel [?] this verse
Y'all ain't worth the dirt on this earth
I'm a lifelong genius worth life on Venus
Or oil on Mars, I boil my bars
'Til you're left disfigured, face configured with boils and scars
Y'all be twitter-snitching, if y'all most def hidden
I'm Christopher Hitchens' [?]
God is not great was written
This is food for thought, Satanic verses
[?] salmon rush these kitchen when I'm spitting
Fitting feds are [?] Boston
I'm weighing all of my options to break the box that we're locked in
We chopped them, dead in the middle of little Italy
Little did we know we got rid of our civil liberties

[Hook: Esoteric]
No time to sleep kid, no time to snooze
No time to lose, they want to keep us confused
We ain't fucking with it, y'all [?]
*Only describe us as soldier survivors*

[Verse 2: Boycott Blues]
Twenty [?], Adidas watch
In about the time I roll a tree to spark
To all my weedheads yeah they should legalize it
Congress need to hit the chronic and realize it
[?] wanna run up in my crib
With a long list of everything I did
[?] New York make a mill off of my [?]
But they ain't worried about feeding of my kids
It's while I feel like peeling back their wigs
Buck the judge like this ain't [?] shit
You know whenever they was [?] ditch
I'm running errands and I'm airing it out
Don't want your errands nigga, cause you're wearing 'em out
Nigga nigga the money's what I'm caring about
Keep that bullshit to yourself sucker, hear me out
Throw 'em up, yuck yuck cheers we out

[Hook: Esoteric]
No time to sleep kid, no time to snooze
No time to lose, they want to keep us confused
We ain't fucking with it, y'all [?]
*Only describe us as soldier survivors*
No time to sleep kid, no time to snooze
No time to lose, they want to keep us confused
We ain't fucking with it, y'all [?]
*Only describe us as soldier survivors*

[Verse 3: Godilla]
Every verse thirty below, you barely a cold breeze
So fly we [?] that'll give you a nosebleed
Poetry in motion opponents, moving with slow feet
Burn a track in the time and take the light of the [?]
So dope that the crowd either [?] in the [?]
We OT, rival crews cloning our whole steez
It don't lurk, confuse 'em, leave 'em with no [?]
Can't [?] us homie, leave you with broke [?]
Bridging a gap between futuristic and [?] this is the time
New kicks matching fisherman hats
Update the formula, we don't live in the past
Overseas without even swimming a lap
Position intact, the illness inside me
Kill the noise quicker than [?] Bill O'Reilly
[?], third world built mentality
Airborne with forms so the style's my gallery

[Hook: Esoteric]
No time to sleep kid, no time to snooze
No time to lose, they want to keep us confused
We ain't fucking with it, y'all [?]
*Only describe us as soldier survivors*
No time to sleep kid, no time to snooze
No time to lose, they want to keep us confused
We ain't fucking with it, y'all [?]
*Only describe us as soldier survivors*
