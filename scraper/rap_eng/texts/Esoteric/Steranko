[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]
Chrome cream, triple beam, home team
Rap the tools of the trade, rocking jewels in the shade
Bathe in the hate, then I rinse in the rapture
Precise, living trife, no prints for the capture
Been there done that, cocaine gum rap
Your shine got dead that you won't get the sun back
Uh, while y'all self destruct
I eat good, maintain health, then fuck
No new friends, but had to dead a couple old ones
Same routine, chain gleam, my niggas hold guns
Building for the better while we bagging up the butter
See me on the TV, but I'm rapping for the gutter
I stood back and contemplate life as I live it
Fall back nigga, keep the phone slang cryptic
Speaking in codes like we speaking in tongues
Cause when it's on, my niggas speaking with guns
Motherfucker

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Mob at the squad, shirts off, hard in the yard
Come live, leave scarred in the coroners car
Look at his face, clowns get put in their place
Boy hot, like the stove top cooking the eigth
Nothing to me, trust me they loving the G
Bad bitch wanna turn up, get fucked in the V
And tossed to the curb. Watch who you're talking to, herb
No dice, get your head cracked off for some words
Think its a game, show that we ain't thinking the same
Don't make a lot of friends, in a blink, shit change
Coming for ours, squad too hungry to starve
How we swarm to the honey, when there's money involved

[Verse 3: Rast RFC]
My flows are a breath of fresh air to a meth head on his deathbed
With gangrene in his arm and it just spread
Into his main vein in his brain
You never seen this level of pure dope since it killed River Phoenix
Or Janis Joplin, yo it's hot son
Lets do a drive-by in my pop's car with my mom's gun
Hop in a Datsun, pop a couple Oxycontin
And take away their oxygen with a shotgun
Rest in peace to Eric Garner
These racist cops killing blacks like COs in Dannemara
Make me wanna blast a revolver
And I ain't talking about no Beatles album, no genre
A martyr, a suicide bomber
A bulletproof armor that'll die for my honor
And we don't give a fuck about the law or Your Honor
Pull his whole whip back and kidnap his daughter

[Verse 4: Esoteric]
You had one job; spit extraordinary lines
Instead, you came with extra-ordinary rhymes
Yo, 7L, tell me where the gat at
Nah, scratch that, I'mma take the AT-AT
Megasaurus, take a tourist by his dad hat
ES in the trenches like a lab rat
Listen, I'm a lion roaring, you're a dog yelping
I am Matt Murdock, you're a Foggy Nelson
I’m John Romita’s Jon Bernthal
Punisher, you're a penis in a urinal
Statue of Liberty dunk leaves your mans buried
I jump over Trump-voters like Stansberry
Win the title and bounce, [?]
Ill punchline, I'm working on the verse still
Slow it down, cause we know you're real fake
It's like when you hit the brakes and the steering wheel shakes
