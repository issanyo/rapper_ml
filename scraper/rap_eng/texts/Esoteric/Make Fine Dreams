Imitate yourself, through a series of roles, actor as hacker cracking codes of conduct not to get stuck, and know. totality, sum of many separate realities. i am my own life. i am my own death. i am my own...death is a story without pages. this is theater without stages. view will change, patterns rearranged, so shatter the category, melt the mold. i am my own life. i am my own death. i am my own...possibility of position, collapse the mainframe with stars of the brain. spots that shine in all directions, remembering the birth of initiation. i am my own life. with each step, exhale strife...take in new life. with each breath, beside me is death to remind me what's left. to make happen. to take action before it takes you. move further through to see from all views. cast ourselves out...way out...from blind existence. tone touched and persistent, here for our own amusement. we earned our exit. make fine dreams
