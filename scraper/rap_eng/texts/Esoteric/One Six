"Ladies and gentlemen" .. "it's about that time"
"Put your-your-your-your hands together"
"We bout to bring him out!"

[Esoteric]
Yo, I'ma read it to y'all, like it was read to me
We the was, the is, and the yet to be
7-L, E-S! A new era, for rap terror
Turn me up Ray, yo..

Cats say they strapped like they ready to blast
Realistically they strapped, meaning needing some cash
Claim you wet, fourth element to keep it real
But when I spit I'll you feel like a fifth wheel
I rip steel, kids peeled like burnt skin
Many tried to copy Esoteric but weren't him
Somethin' bout the way I use breaks and loops
Take snakes, make 'em into boots
Break up groups like cash issues
Tomahawk cruise missiles rip through your tissue, endin' your life
Dem is some nice flowers that I'm sendin' your wife
Attemptin' to fight, point is like a bendable knife
Comin' at me sideways, that's a crab move
That's how crabs move, bad move
I am hip-hop, so if I ever bite a line
I'm only takin back what's rightfully mine, motherfucker!

Just a little taste, strap on a neck brace
One-six.. yo, 7L
