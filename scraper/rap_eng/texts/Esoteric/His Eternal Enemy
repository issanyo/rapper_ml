(enemy pretends to give and it takes) eternal, his enemy. all the nagging, all the nothing behind everything. for the average man, backstabbing is negative business. for the petty tyrant, the knife is the only witness. there is no friend anywhere; there is no enemy anywhere, there is no...all his fears, (all your own) all his pleasures. (enemy) eternal, (enemy) his enemy. all the nagging, all the nothing behind everything
