So much to live
Yet the yearning for death
Perpetual in my mind
To end the pain

I wait for time to show me my path
The continuum or the end?
I see it so clearly it burns my eyes

Into absolutes I fall
No time left
Realisation cuts off all pretence

My dreams so rarely dreams
Just messages of pain in my subconscious
So tired of waking and screaming
And my mind can only ever say no!

Every day,I watch the morning break
Before entering into my nightmare of sleep
I hope one day I may wake and smile

A fool's hope...
A worthless dream....
