Feat. Beyonder, Virtuoso

[Verse One: Esoteric]
I'm (??), your medical doctrine's in journals
Maternally important internal organs and verbally abortin
Epidermal assortments; Esoteric torments, your performance
More reinforcements are necessary
Vocabulary slapped your capillaries
Adversaries are buried and made imaginary
In my stadium, homo sapien brains I'm drainin 'em
Through their cranium, my style subterranean
Like stalagmites, or titanium I brought the strontium
90, stompin 'em with osmium
My rhyme be, like a fluid, now your body spew it
Across your fuckin birthplace like amniotic fluid
I wreck the mic, like electrolytes, extend like dendrites
Do transduction, you under construction like websites
You should be alert when I grip the cordless
Or wind up payin mortgage on your cyrogenic storage

{*scratched 2X: "Be alert!" - Kool Keith*}
{"Duck!"}
{*scratched 2X: "Be alert!" - Kool Keith*}
{"Who is your best, chemical biological man?"}

[Verse Two: Beyonder]
Genetic sources, of every Asian migration
Genetic drift double helix recombination
I be, assisting de-ribonucleaic acids
Fully incubated babies (??) seven synapses
Basic pressure units atmospheres to nearly force
I contradict it for you slow
Two awful Gods who low immense platonic electrodes into
(??)ions of metal ions stop, become oxydized reduced
I cycle in Alpha Nine, with those pesky, petrol-rabbits
That were feeding off energon of nitric acid plastic
Planted inserts, of empirical, formulas
Received by satellite probes, circulating deep space
Calculus of all the second glitch, (??) indubitably
I be creating space bridges with apexes beyond the galaxy
Constructicons, form Devestator the most powerful robot
MC's will break capacities of Dinobots in
Assimilation, jet back to Iacron
The reflectors snapping shorts, busting like the arm of Megatron
Or Galvatron I, eject laser beams to seek out
The lyrical matrix form parabolic to oblique while
Beyonder, this kid be reversing polarities
You see your shit's overplayed, like mental physical vocabulary
Restrain your mainframe with no races left untamed

{*scratched 2X: "Be alert!" - Kool Keith*}
{"Duck!"}
{*scratched 2X: "Be alert!" - Kool Keith*}
{"Duck!"}

[Verse Three: Virtuoso]
I inspire minds with rhymes, like lattice work with vines
My vocals realign, resulting in catapulting
If he's revolting even insulting my mic monarchy
In chronology, they get lobotomy sonically
Ecstatically, rippin 'em with hematology curriculum
Kill and then he's spittin sonnets at the requiem
Lymph nodes, I'm swellin 'em like mononucleuosis
My poems corroding bones like osteoporosis
My orchestration causing transmutation in the Earth's rotation
Now adjacent nations mirror my vocabulation
Like (?)tion, with no procrastination bash your face in
Injectin leukemia through your skeleton
You peons, I rip for eons, beyond your grasping
My blades are hacking through your skull
Pull them out measure calcium graftings
Classic in (?)iums like accordians
Euphoriously speakin in chant, like the Gregorian Monk
Valedictorian, sellin vocal chords in my anatomy emporium
The heart and brain I'm storin 'em
Orpheum sub-zero refigreration and I'm waitin 'em
For two milleniums, I emerge from hibernation
Take your offspring, resection vitals and replace them
Make them my reincarnations, hunt for your relations
And your bloodline, openly crushing castrations
My elocution's executin future generations

{*scratched 2X: "Be alert!" - Kool Keith*}
{"Duck!"}
{*scratched 2X: "Be alert!" - Kool Keith*}
{"Duck!"}
{*scratched 2X: "Be alert!" - Kool Keith*}
{"Duck!"}
{*scratched 2X: "Be alert!" - Kool Keith*}
{"Duck!"}
{*scratched 2X: "Be alert!" - Kool Keith*}
{"Duck!"}
{*scratched 2X: "Be alert!" - Kool Keith*}
{"Duck!"}

{*"Duck!" scratched to the end*}
