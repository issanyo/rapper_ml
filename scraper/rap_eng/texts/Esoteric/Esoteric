Concepts, communication
Balance, domination
Unseen, yet practicable
Where is your answer?
Where is your question?
Based on truth or lies?
Why should it be either?
Existence unseen:

At beckon call:
Not for those who judge:
What they cannot comprehend
Source of knowledge, too vast for words
To concentrate your mind

Of no substance, yet food for thought
And entrance to your soul
It is both life and death
It is both death and life

Fear to some existence to others
In the air you breathe, yet in your mind surreal
Liars are those who claim to know
In their words they say nothing
For words cannot describe it
It is knowledge and yet confusion

See all you can
And look beyond and beyond and beyond
Look through the confusion to find knowledge
Look through the knowledge to find confusion
At all times question everything

(Music - Gordon, Simon, Greg, Bryan. 1/1993)
