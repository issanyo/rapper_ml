[Intro]
Yo
Ah, one-two, ah, one-two
Hold up, hold up, hold up
Yo

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
The flow call it Jon Snow — King of the North
I bust tai chi moves when I'm bringing it forth
Swinging my sword, think twice, blood'll be drawn
Only few animals survive the flood of the storm
When a 1-2 brother is cash
Now you can try to silence me, you can never muzzle the blast
Out in Amsterdam puffing some hash
Nothing but all foreign currency stuffed in my bags

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
As a youth, Beatnuts had me thinking I could blast tecs, ego…
Bigger than I'm Batfleck's last check, We know
What it takes to put you in a casket below
Sea level like your rap status, I get evil
Lines flying out my mind like a parademon in a dream sequence
Zoning out like I'm Brad Stevens' team defense
We stay on target
We building the CZAR-lab then dip in the CZAR-jet

[Chorus]
Bring it back, br-bring it back
If you coming for war then bring it back
Bring it back, br-bring it back
If you coming for war then bring it, bring it, bring it

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Deadly power lines caused a blackout
Been doing this since news flicks, Mickey with the mac out

[Esoteric]
Rappers try to back out, I smack and make him tap out
Crew deep, run with more teams than Jerry Stackhouse
These cats need to give it up

[Inspectah Deck]
I'm like (word)
I'm tryna live it up and get bucks, I spit it tough, listen up
Stand like a high rise, high five chick mixing up Mai Tais
Ray Pizzaria how we slice pies
Beat foreign, trees orange, blue and green Ralph Lauren
Worst days still look like he important
The heart is in me
Plus the sharper darts start the frenzy
Pull out against me, I'ma spark till the cartridge empty

[Esoteric]
We the kinda brothers hit you like The Steiner Brothers
Top choice it is, you can't rhyme above us, no
Kick rocks….. is your assignment from us
I see the moves you make, man, it don't remind us of us (nah)
Wasn't bits of some shit, now you ain't done shit
Listen, we hold the record like vinyl covers
I bet your dime will love us, probably want a diamond from us
They always pick CZARFACE
We animated like a Pixar face
We notorious, so glorious
We the Legion of Doom, the Road Warriors

[Inspectah Deck]
Rap warlord, now picture black [?]
The Reservoir Dog barking like a gat sawed off
Glide like Tony Hawk, bossing the sport
Penny for my thoughts
Thinking like two or three mil'll be the cost

[Chorus]
Bring it back, br-bring it back
If you coming for war then bring it back
Bring it back, br-bring it back
If you coming for war then bring it, bring it, bring it
