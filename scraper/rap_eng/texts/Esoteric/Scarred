I see them coming at me all the time
Lashing out, killing me over and over again
And I laugh for I enjoy all the deaths that I receive
The pain and destruction of my flesh
Killing me over and over again

The blackness still comes, forever killing me
I rock back and forth, staring through
The blackness which slices through
My scarred and dead flesh, yet still I die as I see my skin shred

Dead again and still I stare at the blackness which is still there
Have they not yet reached the core, of my flesh so battered and torn?
Maybe I have no core, maybe inside there's nothing
If so what do I die for?

Staring, watching, willing, killing
Seeing, dreaming, screaming, screaming
Killing, killing, killing, killing:
Willing, filling what wasn't there, emptiness my despair

Stuck, unable to move off my chair
Rocking back and forth, with no eyes, yet still I stare
At the blackness which is always there

(Music - Greg. 3/1993)
