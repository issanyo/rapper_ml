[Intro: Esoteric]
Yeah, yeah, one-two, one-two, Czarface
Ayo Deck, you ready?

[Inspectah Deck:]
You already know man...
My new name Czarfonzerelli, when you see me...
You just call me 'Czarfonzerelli'

[Esoteric]
Yeah, let's go

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
Test me, I run upside your head like Jet Li
So raw, so pure call it fresh squeeze
On the town more than Rex Reeve
Deck he's something like the FDA
How I check cheese
I reach quota, black ops elite soldier
Move undercover through NY, Malik Yoba
G coder, beast moder, never cease motor
Machine gun rap clap until the beats over
Czarfonzerelli so cool
He toss a quarter in the juke-box from across the room
And what I spit upon tome, takes over your mind
The rhyme is like Victor Von Doom
From the womb to the tomb
The boom bap ritual
Not the typical, bullshit that you listen to
Its principle, hip hop that's what you call this
For more bars than Mardi Gras and all this

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
My past is darker than the blackest magic marker in the
Hands of Clive Barker when he's crafting Books of Blood
And I attack it harder, I'm Pat Tanaka
My sparring partner's half of Sparta, my sack is larger
I crack apart an MC like an Iron Man toy with plastic armor
I'm the rap Chewbacca
Get my point across like Hawkeye, the Archer
You ain't runnin shit like half-court games
You out for more fame, that makes me say "Y" like the J in Bj√∂rk's name
Look at you and look at me
You look like a shook emcee
Only time you load the clips is when you put in Pusha T
Kill 'em, drill 'em, grill 'em I'm a villain I'm like Leatherface
You'll never save the lesser race of invaders from space
Come and devastate my Rebel base
But I will sink them in the ocean
With one motion of my hand, and track you down, like a Stan
Smack you down, that's the plan
Beat you till your brains hollow like a moving van
I'm superhuman and I'll prove it again and again
Swinging limbs like it's sink or swim
These rappers set the bar low like Peter Dinklage at the gym
I'm Michelangelo, I'm mutagen, hooligan
You're a terrapin, a shell of yourself, you brag about the metal
In your hands, that's a kettlebell for your health
I'm bout to buckle down, like I pull a belt from the shelf
Ayo, bring that, and we can do a one-on-one even
And let the chips fall where they may like my son eating

[Verse 3: R.A. The Rugged Man]
Moe Dee black frames, 80s era crack pains
I smack veins, I snatch chains, I lack brains
Hijack planes, under siege like you riding Casey Ryback trains
My rap reigns like G Rap, Kane's
Mind manipulated, brain dead spoon fed public
Might as well rip off your head and put your brain in your stomach
Genghis Khan modern mongol on your block conquering
Get every suburban hot soccer mom cock gobbling
I'm the white living in the cave Protestant, I'm not to win
The opposite of white wooly hair and bronze copper skin
With just one rhyme, I entertain the deaf, dumb, blind
I'm clever with my words like a Lord Finesse punchline
Fight quick, bloody butcher knife and an ice pick
Put a cop's testicles in a vice grip
And sodomize him with his nightstick
Strike quick, beat a white chick with my white dick
Gash her up like the whip that they beat Christ with
No enlightening, stay partisan
Fighting with the gays targeting
Frightening what the brains harboring
Bright with the days darkening
Wings up, Heaven Razah, I'm a thug angel
I've been unstable since banging beats on a lunch table
Rock Adidas or fedora dookie Rev Run cable
I'm louder than Wu-Tang, Mobb Deep and Big Pun label
Czar
