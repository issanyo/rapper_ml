[Verse 1: Esoteric]

I’m a mind-bender, time-ender
Who rhymes center foul frontline member
The mic to divide ember blazing you
The blood doesn’t trickle, it sprays
I’m like a young Nikita Koloff with a sickle when I’m scripting the page
For centuries held down bars like penitiaries
You entertain? That’s funny like Kevin James
I stay in your fucking lane like Clark Kent you get it man?
Hip-hop’s deader than Vince Lambardi
It’s full of whining crackers like your wifey’s dinner party
I’m a pharaoh, sword strong by battle
Running with apes like Ann Darrow
On point like Green Arrow
You cool like Tracy Morgan, I’m cool like Tracy Marrow
Lethal weapon stepping
I caught you while you haggle and barter
I’m smarter, you got exposed when we met like Gary Carter
You got no flows when you rep, you just a martyr
You like my clothes back then, just a starter
You ain’t John Gotti, you ain’t got a shotty
You ain’t got body, you just watch Rocky
And get inspired but you ain’t wired for this
I build for this, I kill for this, ill for this
I know you watch a little Tae-Bo
Now you wanna try and fuck with Seamus Ryan though
No no you dimmer than a rhino, I’m Spiderman more hip hop than a Krylon can
Battle? What the fuck you high on man?
The pterodactyl Jesus leave you in pieces

[Verse 2: Planetary]

Whenever I say so we full-court pressing them
Handle the rock and crossover like the rest of them
Who got the ratchet? I crack the pendulum
My adrenaline race the pace you trembling
My regiment takes shots of bad medicine
Extinguish the game like distinguished gentlemen
Severing so far the best with the pen again
Venomous ink paint the picture so elegant
Elevate my state, I’m high like a pelican
Powerful punchlines puncture through your skeleton
Space niggas erase niggas irrelevant
Post up prevalent in my development
I make the cake so the dough can settle in
Paz there’s no boose so we through the kettle in
Pharaohs amongst the kings of this tenement
