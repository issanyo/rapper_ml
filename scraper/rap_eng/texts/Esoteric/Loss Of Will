Doubt stripping the soul
Unending questions driving me into insanity

Time took its toll
Enough to ensure
The mind cannot mirror the soul

With each tide
The will corrodes further

Relentless grip
Squeezing out the life
Of this shipwrecked body
Lost in the gallows of hopes and dreams...

Reality crumbles
Shivering, as truth lay bare

And roads of nonchalance grew upon...
