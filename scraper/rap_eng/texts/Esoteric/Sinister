[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
They don’t understand how I survived
How I stayed custom made
From the frames on down to the ride
While you lames get clowned to the side
I’m in your town live
Blow an ounce of dro in your face
While I count mine
A crime how I body the track
Tip's back in the lobby with craps
Now I'm big time, don of the pack
On the inside, harder to act
On the flip side, dodging the traps
I’m so (sinister)

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
Catch bodies like possessed rotties off the leash
Next shot, he's more zombies, cause I wanna feast
And if I ain’t being fed, I'm seeing red
I’m Evil Dead, people bled
I am Sam Raimi, don’t you be mislead
I’m running the stage call me the beige
All my words suicidal, yeah, they jump off the page
And somersault into your brain
Then assault you with insane thoughts
I'm Banksy on the west bank
Y'all been brainwashed

[Hook]
Step 1, rep your team
Step 2, kick his head off clean, guillotine
Step 3, get on your Jet Li
Sinister raps make you all rock me

[Verse 3: Esoteric]
You and me, we don’t seem the same
You move like the blob, I’m a speeding train
I’m a blood red etching of a demon framed
You a high-res photograph of beads of rain
Release the flame, you in an easy lane
You took the easy road, I kill you easy man
I can increase the pain, I move in Jesus name
But with an evil brain, because I’m just so (sinister)

[Verse 4: Inspectah Deck]
Yo, televised soldier for life, with my life on the line
At all costs, I be knowing the price
Got a hot head, rolling the dice
The feeling like, "I wish I could have this moment for life"
Like, my too hot, get comfy with the two spot
Rude boy, eat your food boy, you will lose stop
You say you "gangsta gangsta" and you don’t hot
He jumped out of his skin when a balloon popped

[Hook]
Step 1, rep your team
Step 2, kick his head off clean, guillotine
Step 3, get on your Jet Li
Sinister raps make you all rock me

[Outro]
Ok, what we have here is the Shamus Deckasaurus
More commonly known to the natives of this east coast jungle as the Czarface
Wow, look at him
The Czarface is such a beast
Always hungry, eating vinyl and devouring human prey as quick as a wink
Those fangs are no joke
That brilliant shiny armour is impenetrable
Plus it attracts the slappers during the mating season
Look at him go
With moves like that, this predator is truly at the top of the food chain
