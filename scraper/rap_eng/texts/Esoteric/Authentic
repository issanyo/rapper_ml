[Verse 1: Blacastan]
Graffitti on the wall like hieroglyphics in the hallway
Jakes watching the traffic we in and out all day
Scholars in the streets, fuck a bachelor's degree
It's either rap or playing ball or putting spatulas to keys
When it's all said and one I'm trying to touch another G
So far from a milli how could this ever be
Put my name up on that billy when your touring overseas
Rats and snakes in the streets they be warring over cheese
For the temporary shine I'm trying to permanently glow
Leave my name marked in history before it ever go
Pressing hard on that looseleaf and pray a nigga blow
It's easy to get life on a single trigger blow
Stay focused, walk straight, master your high
If you fall pick yourself up give another try
Cause this life is a dirty game filled with deceit
I'm at war with the enemy but never retreat

[Hook]
Hands up for the fallen soldiers and the single mothers
And the deadbeats who turn they backs and claim they love 'em
For the struggling streets, for the love of my peops
Hold your heads up, dry your tears and never weep
(x2)
It's authentic

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
I'm trying to make a mark, trying to leave a dent
Trying to represent, circumvent, let them play the malcontent
I'm fully in my zone, I powered down the phone
I let the mental roam, I'm better off alone
Life is crazy, life is nuts, life is blood and guts
Life is what you make it, life is making it out of ruts
And me and Blac we choke out the snakes that are breaking trust
They ain't effecting us, they hate makes them combust
Their mouths are working while their brain it is collecting dust
They used to getting free rides so they scared of us
Any way you want it take the meaning, I could mean a gun
A mean MC it'll mean self expression as a human being
And I ain't bitter but I'm passed the good guy stage
Sick of reaching for these stars from a foot high stage
Cause life's a dirty game and it's filled with deceit
I'm at war with the enemy but never retreat
Hands up

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Planetary]
It's authentic, I only do dirt in the cars rented
That's all tinted, when I spit bars I'm off limits
All vintage, new shit sounds fucking ridiculous
Bad mixes, pray to the three sixes it fixes
Rosaries and some crucifixes, I need assistance
Booming systems, if I cock back I won't miss 'em
My only mission to serve and protect those who listen
Stop bitching you want it to change to lose vision
I Ruth Chris 'em but I'd rather pay for a new kitchen
Invest these rhymes and just sleep in the booth spittin'
Who the fuck are you shitting? I'm a beast with it
Leave with your teeth missing that's the way that we hit 'em
I'm a pharoah engineer, send 'em to the afterlife
Stage full of acolytes, motherfucker pass the mic
Passionate passion of Christ, I'm your savior
Army shit, armed from Oregon to Arcadia
