Internal images
Scattered within translucent thought
Order amongst the chaos of the psyche

The external dilapidation
A tribute to their world of regression
I pour forth my scorn
To the dominion of slaves
Bound by blindness
Their fear of the unknown
Is greater than the price of ignorance

The changing face of humanity
A different face for each occasion
Remove the mask and see the vacant stare

The mask is all they know....

Behold the sight
The irony of it all

Everything is true
In the dimension of dreams

Their dirge wrought through the chains of insecurity
The common-trod path leads to oblivion (trampled by fools)
The path that is built remains strong

The valour of perception
Is bestowed upon few

(Music-Steve,1995/96)
