Born unto a bastard nation
The dying remnants of our breed
Aura's of,an ancient past
Of those that knew so long before....

But time goes on...
Misanthropic breed
Engulf our suffering
Food for the strong

To overcome is the way of the warrior
Regret not that which we have done
Regret that which we have not

Blackness in our pride
Cast the event o'er again
Let thy wisdom be thy guide
Let thy will be thy gain
And feed

Gluttonous rapture
The sword so bravely held
Marked with the blood of death (the certainty of life)

Time,the foe of all whom would'st not taste
Let mine will be fulfilled
Let the rest go to waste

Let the blood run
At war with the race (of humanity)

[Music-Simon, Winter 1995]
