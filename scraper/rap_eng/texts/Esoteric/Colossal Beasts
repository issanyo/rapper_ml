[Intro: (Madchild)]
"What happens to our world if massive monstrous man beasts... like this... invade us? His arrival catapults the whole city into an ocean of fear. For this colossal beast (grrr) is at war with the world. Our world. A world his savage instincts can only hate." (grrr)

[Madchild:]
RAWR!

[Verse 1: Madchild]
I get on stage and all I see is fuckin' legs runnin'
Nobody wanna battle me, they know I'm head huntin'
Represent the underground, dark force like Boba Fett
Venomous saliva like I'm spittin' from a cobra's head
An acrobatic jack-o-lantern, I'm immaculate
Attack ya like the cackling jackal you should evacuate
I still tag with spray paint, wearin' skull face paint
These days rappers are less fillin' but taste great
I'm still a cannibal, a human with an ape's frame (roar)
I'm still as stupid as I was back in the eighth grade
My tongue's a fully loaded clip in a Baryshnikov
So tell your bitch to cancel Christmas if you piss me off
I'm the little monster and I'm from the Addams Family
Eat your fuckin' heart and then I'll feast on your anatomy
Skulls are shatterin', I spit assault and battery
So dousin' you in battery acid is a form of flattery

Verse 2: Prevail
Yo, Mercury Rising, ride the wave of Poseidon
Abrasive arrival, basically spiral, viral eight headed Hydra, Cairo
Amen-Ra, Amon Düül, Dawn World rise on all of you
My pawns can cut a king in two, my songs are filled with fortitude
Fortress fortified from you, so you can not contain
Break a Bat's back like Bane, take you there then set it off
I'm Raw, long live the King, c'mon y'all and let if fuel
Dead and spread the residue, Residence is evil, run a fever
Turn to zombie, Walking Dead, Inoculate the populate
Apocalyptic red, assignment Omega Red
Event Horizon dead environment, now I'm firin', drivin'
Nails through my palms, I've arrived in many forms and this is one
Paint it black, then Pitch it Black like Riddick, rap acidic
Admit it, it's analytic, starin' at different beta testing form is written
I'm creative as Alpha K-9, take my time to kill like Cujo
Fill numerical lines, Sudoku, yo this Death Machine's so beautiful (yea, yo)

[Verse 3: Esoteric]
If you ask me where the gat at I'm automatically mad at you
Tappin' into ya brain and drainin' veins like a catheter
Raisin' cane like a trafficker, probably maim your ambassador
I live a wild life, I should move the label to Africa
I'm a genius, fans that greet us think I channel Jesus
You plan to beat us, nah, you really want a chance to meet us
You can't believe this, you jumpier than a trampoline is
Your pansy demons all divas, a bunch of Angelinas
I ran arenas in tan Adidas, commandin' leaders
You fuck around, get checked early like cancer screeners
I gotta break the bad news man, you can't defeat us
We the meanest, while you fruity like a tangerine is
I stand the leanest, my mammoth penis bigger than the planet Venus
Cameron Diaz saw it now she understands why I'm elitist
She's mad when she can't see me like a fan of Cena's
I am the zenith of MCing, Esoteric heaters

[Verse 4: Celph Titled]
Let's play a game of "Who Kills Who First" (huh)
Unemployed but I guarantee you my tools work (pow)
I'm at the Head Banger's Ball with guitars and sawed off shots
The breakfast master ready for the toaster to pop
Pray for my enemies even though I'm not religious
I do it just in case the good Lord wanna keep 'em livin' (haha)
Insert the clip in my bitch, pull back her long nails
The sights on the top rail, she a motherfuckin' bomb shell (aww)
Y'all some clumsy soap handlers
And if you snort my brand of gun powder, leave your nose cancerous (ahh)
No one want drama, so let's move to the snuff films
Documents of me stretchin' your face into a duck bill (faggot)
So who the fuck real? (me) I know for one it's
The Army and the Swollen savages, rollin' with ratchets (Rrrraa)
And holdin' world records for dome crackin' battin' averages (aw)
Sink your Battleship with one stroke when I smack a bitch
(Titled)

[Verse 5: Apathy]
It's like somebody threw a penny in the wishin' well and wished for Hell
I wish that AIDS would attack all your white blood cells
My peace offerin'? A blanket that my grandma made
Which I infected with a strain of the bubonic plague
I spread famine, I'm slammin' body parts inside of cannons
Shootin' over castle walls, somewhere over blood's landin'
I'm dancin' in Red Rain, insane as Charles Manson
Examine my brain, all my slain victims are chantin' my name
Fuck the talk, I slice tongues from faces
Tightenin' Nike laces, stormin' enemies' bases
Duelin' at ten paces, a trail of cold cases
I'm right up in your face, but my mind's in a million places
Best believe I'm wicked study tetrahedral physics
Step inside a portal that resembles glowing liquid
Foes inflicted and boa constricted 'til they eyes are poppin'
My concoction of hydra toxins will leave your body droppin'
