[Intro]
Very funny
But proving beyond question the supremacy of mind over matter
And now as much as I regret it, you have become an obstacle in my plan
An inconsequential conglomeration of matter to be destroyed by the power of my mind!

I read comics and books, yeah Marvel

[Verse 1 - Esoteric]
Seamus is one to marvel at, sharp nut dog
I'm peeling scalps of Americans
And leaving them with Red Skulls
Hand dictates like metal plates like Dr. Doom
Embodying the track like Spidey's black costume
A man of arms, Seam is Otto Octavian
Beware the Green Goblin that bogglin' your cranium
Torturing humans is easy, believe me
When it comes to 6th senses, Daredevil can't see me
Project thoughts like Psylocke, uncanny
Making noise like The Banshee and DC like Vigilante
I'm clobbering things like Ben Grim
With a dome like Mysterio
I zap like Electro
Villains be petrol with their bodies in The Sandman
Call to The Vulture, you need a guardian
My wizardy's leaving brothers grim
Cause I'm colossal, similar to Rasputin
Never try and diss, the Tony Stark like scientist
My powerments rise like Iron Man's iron fist
I insist, you face the Kingpin like Wilson Fisk
Practice, I'm known to wreck worlds like Galactus
I pull like Magnus, you couldn't hack this
Battling crooks with grappling hooks, I track this
Beat like Raven, my origin contains
Astonishing tales, plus the legend of my name
Maximum Carnage from my Venom, is killer, I'm iller
Straight to the fuckin' point like Frank Miller
Seamus Ryan's the name son
I'm trying to make papes like J. Jonah Jameson


[Verse 2 - MC Karma]
I stalk men like Watchman and gas 'em like bourbon
They get mad specs like Charles X was just target
Fuck the skull at wish, turn at vision God
Pray while kids shell themselves from my rhymes like Nick Fury
Hurry, be out in a Flash, nothing to stand for
Once I start wetting up kids like Prince Namor
Way more, sense than that one Weapon X
Compared to me Logan ain't nothing but fuckin' second best
Cyclops side kids break north like alpha flight
My mind's tight plus changes like Werewolf by night
Complex factors, X-Ray vision can't find 'em
Comments of Karma up at Arkham Asylum
Wise, don't start this like Gambit pulls cards kid
My styles mad wild like New Mutant's first artist
Punishing pawns plus equipped like Frank Castle
You couldn't find me out with all of Bruce Wayne's cash flow
Kids beg the Justice League to bust this ?creep?
I shits on point like Adamantium up the sleeve
Changing up on kids just like The Hulk's skin tone
You know when I'm around cause you smell the fuckin' brimstone
