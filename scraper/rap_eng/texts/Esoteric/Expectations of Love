Society and religion teach us to love one another
To follow the frameworks
That filled their empty lives - empty minds

The pressure I feel
Is fucking unreal
Why can't they see my inability to love?
Why can't they open their eyes?

All they see is what they want to see
They see their vision of me; it's not me!
How can I love others when I can't love myself?
The pain I've felt has destroyed the love in me

My frustration increases into a silent scream
Where is the relief? When can I be free?
I have tried to love but it can never be
Hate is all I can ever feel

To dwell on death is love for me:
