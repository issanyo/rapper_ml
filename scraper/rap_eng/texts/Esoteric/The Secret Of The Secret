I Ponder Eternity
Longing For The Keys Of Time
To Wrap Me In Their Infinite Knowledge

The Incongruous Symphony Crashes Through The Waves
Of My Thoughts
I Am Not Of Flesh...
When Waves Of Sublime Thought, Coarse Through My Veins

Symbolic Release Of Sorrow
Makes Way For The Impending Vision

I Am Where Space Nor Time Could Not Be
Suddenly...Disembodied...
Lost In The Vortex Of Insanity
(I Am) Quickened By The Poison
Yet Deadened By The Pain
Unable To Breathe, I Release The Beast From Within

No Conscious Thought
Cimmerian Voyage Transcends

Searing Through Endless Planes
Exalted Streams Of Consciousness
Plant Mine Will Into The Seeds Of Time
"Senses, Elucidated
(Visions Of Thought Cast Before Me)
Logic Dictates No Longer
To The Workings Of Time"
Such Nonsensical Truths
Caress My Sumptuous Blood
Envelop Me In This Forbidden Arcanum

I, The Seer Of My Destiny
The Harbinger Of Despair
Slumber Into The Enticement Of Sorrows
Through The Quiescent Halls Of Existence

The Freedom Of Chaos....
The Secret Of The Secret....
The Truth Of The Truth....
