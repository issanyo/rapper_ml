"Haunt me... haunt me... do it again."
Says the Ram-Faced Boy
Caught inside of a dream that screams her name
Shiver, twitch, eyes black as pain
Shiver, twitch, flailing away

Do you remember, cause I can't forget
It's everything now, now is everything
Opportunity follows where crisis leads
Somewhere in-between

"Haunt me... haunt me... do it again."
Says the Ram-Faced Boy
Caught inside of a dream that screams...

With renewed momentum, mapping absurd debris
A natural coward and his daily bleed
Caught inside of a dream that screams her name

"Haunt me... haunt me... do it again."
Says the Ram-Faced Boy
These true lies and this lost false memory
It's never over, this is endless
To stay alive she says
"Just keep awake" she says, and "Keep your distance."

He imitates - "What am I good for?"
He responds, such an expressive puppet - "What am I good for?"

"Haunt me... haunt me... do it again."
Says the Ram-Faced Boy
Caught inside of a dream that screams her name
It's never over, this is endless
To stay alive she says
"Just keep awake" she says, and "Keep your distance."
