[Des Devious]
Yeah, Des D nigga!
Celph Titled, Crypt the Warchild
Where you at nigga?
Yeah!

[Hook: Crypt the Warchild]
This be that murda murda
I shall not speak no further
After this it's hazardous
My niggas pullin' burners
Your weak shit don't concern us
I see you gettin' nervous
By accident, we make more moves than niggas make on purpose

[Crypt the Warchild]
This shit is gettin' scary
Y'all niggas best be wary
My team is legendary
Y'all niggas secondary
We stackin' cemeteries
More the merry, more to bury
Fuck 'em all, fuck the world
Put em in a mortuary, and all I know is pain
I walk through coldest rain
I ain't supposed to change
Cause I approach the game
I'm tryin to coast the plane
Y'all niggas know the name
Warchild, Celph Titled, Des D
Of course it slams, we too dangerous
So move away from this, niggas will waive the fifth
At you courageous kids
I ain't no plagiarist
This shit is major biz
So let the truth be told when I'm sayin' it

[Hook: Crypt the Warchild]
This be that murda murda
I shall not speak no further
After this it's hazardous
My niggas pullin' burners
Your weak shit don't concern us
I see you gettin' nervous
By accident, we make more moves than niggas make on purpose

[Des Devious]
(Check it, yeah!)
I do it for the hell of it
Spit it, mix it, package it up
For the sale of it
Get profit for the sell of it
The meanest nigga, this bullet is sixteen
For props and cream
Close the screen
You plot, I scheme
Competition take heed
And listen build with henchmen
Slander your name, damage is done
For this rendition, walkin' the streets
Kickin' your rocks, steady grippin
Problem get solved, blink of an eye
The fifth is livid
Listen I ain't here to promote no violence, violence
But that's what happen when motherfuckers can't keep it silent
Bloody you up sharp-tipped death from a thousand
I ain't grew up in housin'
Did a lot of wilin'
Robbin' niggas, that was my twist
Slug it out in an instant
If you was resistant I'm a predicate
Never seen jail time for crimes I committed
The Most High sees all, so still I'm repenting

[Hook: Crypt the Warchild]
This be that murda murda

[Celph Titled]
You'll see my face when I attack
No ski-hat or a Jason mask
No laser-beam gleam
So you ain't seein' where I'm aimin' at
Charles Manson clone
Melting flesh like Indiana Jones
It's Tampa's own, Titled the Toolman
Bringin' hammers home (Yup!)
And fame it's know me here
Gats will kill ya
And we'll bust inside your house like Michael Jackson's "Thriller"
Caterpillar arm slasher flick, slash a bitch, distort a thug
Separate the men from the women, like a divorce court judge
I'm not a rapper I'm a rocker in a grunge band
I'm supa' fly
One hell of a helicopter stunt man (Yeah!)
We'll make your guns jam
And leave your forehead crammed
With sharp swords that cut Boars Head ham
And we're back!
It's not +The Torture Papers+ (No!)
We got more claws and razors (Yes!)
A lot of Rambos, Commandos and Terminators (Uh-huh)
You +Die Hard+ when I rhyme bars
Roll an L with the same holy scroll that God's DNA's designed on

[Hook: Crypt the Warchild]
