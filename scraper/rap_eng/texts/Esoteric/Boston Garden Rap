[VERSE 1: Raydar Ellis]
Now every time I start a verse I break at least 3 commandments
Kind of like Pluto because I never plan it, I'm outlandish
In the way that make Apaches look like the own ranches
It's the art of war, your blood's the only color on the canvas
And I don't mean it like a thug sense of how you can get got
Fuck being gangster - I'm hip hop, you got it?
Every time you walk in the label the A&R's like "Not it"
Immune to your shit 'cause I circle-circle dot-dot it
Body heat is a toxic leak, got a beat? I don't gotta speak
Cop a seat, start to think psychically make the speakers peak
Deleteriously off their high horse make an ass of their views
Your DJ must not know the alphabet - Forgetting his cues
My favorite DJ got those and 6 extra L's to abuse
Esoteric, Jawn P and I'm the new kid in school
I'm Raydar Ellis, nice to meet you, show busting my styles
Egocentric, egotripping with frequent flyer miles

[VERSE 2: Esoteric]
You want to set it on us? We got gold medals on us
We rep the veterans like Dan & them, you read up on us
We better than we ever been, you place your bet upon us
We medicine to many men, your men are dead and; goners
Rep the strongest in the hood 'til every song is understood
And then they often wonder could Eso clap like thunder should
The answers yes - To read my poetry, my specialty
A legacy authentically mentally deadin' enemies
Tremendously, the recipes fresh - Death is the penalty
And generally I tend to be best - No "accidentally"
I'm ready as I'll ever be, politically I'm to the left of Teddy Kennedy
That's how I want you to remember me
Fuck around and lose your title, wind up suicidal
You frontin' hard with no bars like unicycles
You don't wanna face me crab
I'll cut your head off like Jay-Z's HP ads

[VERSE 3: Jawn P]
Yo - Into the terror fields, I'm here to prove my era's real
No better deal, you cross the line you'll feel embedded steel
I grip the microphone and wield it like a battle axe
I got the shovel and the lime inside the Cadillacs
It's like a mad attack when I begin to strategize
I'll terrorize your entourage with simple battle cries
I batter eyes and noses, I'll shatter guys imposing
The public's waiting on my word like I'm the voice of Moses
I'm the choice of most kids - They know my reputation
The talk of my retirement was pure speculation
I tour across the nation, reppin' my area
I'm from the boons so I be causing mass hysteria
You sound inferior, I'm not in fear of ya
Forget about me cause Pun is taking care of ya
It's Esoteric, Jawn P, Raydar Ellis - Yo
We running shit like we're the fucking Goodfellas
