Disgust for the standards set by you
Disgust for your aims of mass control
Freedom is your silencing mechanism
Fortunately for you people are too blind and ignorant to see
That while you exist they will never be free

Your lies of freedom I spit upon
From birth you have calculated our control
Born as a number on your little machines
A number to check upon, to keep under control

Now to the blind I'll help you see
That you are born under a contract laid down by society
Obligations to obey their laws, no freedom of speech
You are one mind, they are many
Justice has been decided by the narrow-minded bastards
Who lived centuries ago, leading the fools
With the commandments of their false "God" they made up the rules

Fuck your morals I have my own mind
To decide what is best for me
You know nothing of psychology, only of fantasy
And love of order in your tidy, empty lives

From lies you built the order of society
Scepticism your enemy, you try to make people believe
From an early age so that they cannot retrieve
Their instincts of life and questioning, so that they just
Follow blindly, but you'll never blind me

I have only hatred for those in authority
And the blind fools who follow
So weak in spirit, never questioning
I have only hate for this fucking society

So weak
I have only hate for this fucking society
