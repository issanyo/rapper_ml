[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]

I make it rain not distributing cash, but like an Indian Dance
Really never gave the rhythm a chance
Still chained in the dungeons of rap, thunder clap
Get back, I spit facts, leaving blood on the track
That’s your highness [?] like I’m attracted to light
I’m on another plane like I’m getting back on a flight
Deadly statements, sedate your mental stasis
Cause you nausea, temporal displacement
Jooks on the good look, tally the books
Burning Cali kush pushing through the valley of crooks
Czar Fonzareli, Czarface is what you’re dealing with
Hazmat Rap, check your pulse you ain’t feeling this

[Verse 2: Blacastan]

Blacs is dope, flier than Snook off the top rope
Phantom of the Op swinging my cloak, chopping your throat
I know I’m nice but don’t gas me brah
All hail the Czar bringing action like Run Run Shaw
Blast it for you, won’t run no more
Black Panther movie debut, Marvel Civil War
While you rolling through the ER, strapped to a gurney
I’m strapped on a yacht with Czarface on another journey
I spark fires in the booth, the human torch couldn’t burn me
Your final resting place is on a mantle in an urn G
Knick-Knack-paddy-whack get your jaw tapped
From Round house kicks cracking through your thorax

[Verse 3: Esoteric]

I’m hanging out the window of a stolen Corolla
Holding a hammer so berserk all my verses touch you like Boba
I’ll acupuncture your skull then I’ll actually punch your nose
Accuracy of blows, make you actually touch your toes
Imagine Baron Zemo directed by Tarantino
Now imagine Czarface crushing him like a glass of vino
I’ll put your gal up on tracks like a palomino
Now she’s lifted, and he’s gifted
On my high horse like Seabiscuit when the weed’s twisted
I’m rhyming on a 60 foot boat and I glisten and glow
Tighter than your grip on your phone
And it’s like the NBA commissioner spoken ‘cause I get at it
With my silver tongue official like a whistle is blowing
Pull up, like Golden State in the transitional motion
I got a mechanical mind, with an outstanding design
That’ll last through the annals of time
Each lines mad titan, word I’m the Thanos of rhyme
With fans wall to wall like how tarantulas climb
