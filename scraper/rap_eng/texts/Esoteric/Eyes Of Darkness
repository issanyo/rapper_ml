Throughout our childhood, we live in fear
Of all that we hear, never-ending tears:
Ignorance so absolute, within their minds so small
Into the depths of their shadows we fall
To live and breathe in sadness, pain and agony
Their mendacious emotions, race through me
Feeling love and hate for someone untrue
My cauldron of life, my feelings subdue
I am still a child:

Ill prepared guardians take care of our existence
Without thought to their actions of consequence
The light of our eyes died while we were conceived
By the whores and sluts, our mothers, their depravity unconcealed
Souls are left in a desolate place
Forever rotting, stagnant within the foul waste
But their corruption is kept, for it has work to do
Prevaricating young minds, so that they cannot see through

The lies of society, you're a puppet to perform
While they laugh with pleasure, as you try to conform
Why? Question why! Doubt is your only friend!

I have such hatred for these creatures of lies
Their simple actuality is enough for me to despise
Am I right to judge their insignificance?
Yes! So are you, those without indifference

For Satan's mind is vast among those who deceive
And on those he feeds, those who try to believe
With their moral fairy tales, and scriptures so frail
To myself and to Satan, you can hear my hail

"Zodacare od Zodameranu! Odo cicale Qaa! Zodoreje, lape zodiredo
Noco Mada, Hoathahe Saitan!"
