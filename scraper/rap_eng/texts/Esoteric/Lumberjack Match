[Intro]
We still don't care, anytime anywhere
Oh lovely,lovely,lovely blood
And now, the world tag-team champions!

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
Cock back the hammer, watch me lay them down
Czarface the villians, we don't play around
Nobody make a sound, so now the battle is on
Grab your woman and children and get to safer ground
The king stun like the Jamaican town
Futuristic flow, Darth start with a laser sound
Leaving nothing but a vapor trail
And my bass, heavyweight, no shake, I'mma break the scale

[Break]
Inspector, we have followed your instructions to the lettering

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
Let me just cut to the chase, you are a bucket of waste
I make producted a pace, Barry Allen when I race
You can scuff the J's up, but you do not fuck with the face
You can get dumped in a lake
Besides double D's I don't really fuck with nothing that's fake
I show up drunk in your way
Looking for something to break, bumping to Geto Boys, take
Mind over lunatic, nuclear Ryan doo doo is you the dick
Click, got my mutant plus a student of this shit

[Break]
Oh this that next Czarface shit, right?
(Si, senor)

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Fear me coming like Ndamukong Suh
Bottom line I'm a problem for dudes, it's not an option to lose
I'm shining, I'm blinding, it's like I'm rocking jewels
Czar too, keep it funky like a locker room
The flow universal, I'm Doctor Who
Soul seeker I goes deeper than Popa Wu
Hundred thou, going wild, let the Bonnaroo
Wu-Tang forever, you just stopping through

[Break]
Ok,let's go. O,ok let's go

[Verse 4: Esoteric]
Y'all don't want any of this
Score without any assists
Sound boogie down like the brothers, Kenny and Kris
Get a better serve, your dream has been deferred
That ain't gods path, you a pet that occurred
Rappers wanna kill me but that shit hasn't yet occurred
My rhymes are lazy, border collie, shit you never heard
Shit you might not even get, no you can't even see a set
Never spot me on the bench, but I got a lethal rep
Yo,Deck

[Break]
Can't see us man
(Tell 'em!)

[Verse 5: Inspectah Deck]
Fucking with the three, you ain't moving wise
Call it lambo doors, that's suicide
I put cats to sleep, leave 'em euthanized
Skull Mountain king, no amusement ride
Foolish pride, the reason for you to scrutinize
You can hide but I still see through disguise
On a hookah high, INS too super fly
Bring fire to your camp like kumbaya
Kumbaya

[Verse 6: Esoteric]
The Czarface mission, make seven figures
Like a super suck lord, limited edition
Listen, my brain sci-fi
You try and test it I'll pass with flying colors
Like a gangbang drive-by
I maintain my fly side, cultivate my grimy one
You can call for help, but you'll be dead by 9 1
How we body 'em Rebel?
Like a broken elevator, wrong on so many levels

[Outro]
As he sits eachd ay at his board along with his characters
It's what's inside the mind that counts
If you look at my characters you'll find me. No matter what
Kind of character you create a little of yourself
Must remain there
