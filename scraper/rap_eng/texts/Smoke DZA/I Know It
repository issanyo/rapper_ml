[Intro: Excerpt from the film Malcolm X]
"Alright, we gon' rob this town blind. Anybody want out, you say so now. Good, good, ok. I set up a stake and I got somebody to move the goods for us; all we need now is a driver, any suggestions?"
"How 'bout Rudy?"
"Yeah, Rudy"
"Who's Rudy?"

[Bridge: Young Roddy]
And I know it, I know it
I know what I'm doin'

[Verse 1: Young Roddy]
And I remember takin' them roadtrips
Them roadtrips, tryin' get paid
I remember ditchin' school, doin' what? Tryin' get laid
They lurkin' all on my I-G, that's so bitch-made
Hah, and I know it, I know it
Fool, I know what I'm doin', let's get it
I'm always smokin' that sticky
I ain't ever hide from no nigga
I ain't ever trick to no bitches
My 'hood don't raise no snitches
Got a Houston bitch who smoke Swishers
Got a L.A. bitch who stay trippin'
Like she don't fuck with her nigga
Knowin' damn well she love another nigga, lets' get it
They give me the keys to my city
My bitch, she gave me the keys to her crib
I made a whole lot of money, damn right, by sellin' a whole lot of deals
Remember I rocked the same fit, fuckin' right
Now I got me a whole lot of gear
I used to peddle that white
Could of fucked around and got me a whole lot of years, let's get it
Now she wanna fuck with me
At first she thought she was too much for me
Can't get the time of that day
This bitch probably plottin' up on my money
But damn this ho, she so mad pretty
But most of all this ho, she mad petty
I treat this ho like she Mary
Yep, I pass that ho to my fellas, let's get it

[Hook: Young Roddy]
I know it, I know it
Fool I know it, I know it
They say I'm that nigga, and I know it, I know it
Ugh, I know it, I know it, I know it, I know it
They say I'm that nigga, and I know it, I know it
Ugh, I know it, I know it, I know it, I know it
They say I'm that nigga, and I know it, I know it
I know it, I know it, shit I know it, I know it
They say I'm that nigga, and I know it, I know it

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Don't hate, stay focused
I show it, I flow it
They like, "Oh that's DZA, he's smokin' on potent"
Oh you know it, you know it
I got a fifty-five box, and I blow it, I blow it
And I owe it, I owe it
No celebration, but I'm sippin' on Moet; that's how you gotta do it
Niggas ain't borrow my style, oh they stole it, they stole it
I never wondered what's the motive, cause I know I'm that nigga
And they know it, they know it
And they know it, they know it
Hustler, stone poet, Jet Life all-star [?]
So you know how I'm rollin', and you know I stay glowin'
Local, worldwide, state-to-state
Boss up on a nigga, make him hate
Tow joints in, blow an eighth to face
Five-star love, nigga, rape the rates
Top floor, I'm on the P-H
Flew my bitch in my from G-A
Smokin' K-K for my brother out in P-A
Saturday night car tunes, I'm on the freeway, enjoyin' that bounce
Kushed God tracks, nigga, how that sound?
Especially in an era filled with clowns
I walk through and I see the frowns
KONY motherfucker, I'll wear that crown
Illest nigga around, mackin' with my rounds
Left my flow in lost and found
P-O-P, hold it down

[Hook: Young Roddy]
I know it, I know it
Fool I know it, I know it
They say I'm that nigga, and I know it, I know it
Ugh, I know it, I know it, I know it, I know it
They say I'm that nigga, and I know it, I know it
Ugh, I know it, I know it, I know it, I know it
They say I'm that nigga, and I know it, I know it
I know it, I know it, shit I know it, I know it
They say I'm that nigga, and I know it, I know it

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
My car used to stop on us, but now I got the drop homie
Suckers stay watchin' out for me
Listen up, if I talk, you know it's 'bout money
Honey-sweet candy paint, metal flakes on that seventy-eight
[??] on the interstate
Late for a dinner-date, so tell that bitch I'm comin'
I'm on my way, I'm here for mine
Front line for them dimes everyday
All the time on my plane Jane presidential Rolly face
Ain't no flexin', I'm just steppin' out
Sorry if you feelin' disrespected by some shit I got
My newest shit might make you slit your wrists, stop

[Hook: Young Roddy]
I know it, I know it
Fool I know it, I know it
They say I'm that nigga, and I know it, I know it
Ugh, I know it, I know it, I know it, I know it
They say I'm that nigga, and I know it, I know it
Ugh, I know it, I know it, I know it, I know it
They say I'm that nigga, and I know it, I know it
I know it, I know it, shit I know it, I know it
They say I'm that nigga, and I know it, I know it
