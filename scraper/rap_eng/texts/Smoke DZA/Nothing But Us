[Intro: Curren$y]
We don't allow blunts in the cut
Tell the valet to pull up my truck
Higher than a mug, ain't nothin' what up but us
Ain't nothin' what up but us
We don't allow blunts in the cut, yeah

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Peel off like a New Era sticker
Out that bitch like a newborn my nigga
Can't get tangled in the web of broad weave
Over your bed, sleep
Homie you weak, that's not G
Holding hands with your bitch
When the money come you can't reach
So when it's money talk you can't speak
Who you been with jive ass
I'm Hollywood multitasking, rapping and acting
You just acting like you rappin'
Acting like you trappin', you trap champ what happened
I'm high in a psychedelic tree smilin'
Cheshire Cat'n, Galapagos Island
Turtle shell hashing
Spillin', smoking good with a bad one
J.E.T.S. nigga playin' dirty with the fair ones
The Brazilian thick leg wavy hair ones
Been on cloud nine since square one, yeah

[Hook: Curren$y]
Higher than a muh
Ain't nothing what up but us
Paper Planes man, we don't allow blunts in the cut
Tell the valet to pull up my truck
Higher than a muh
Ain't nothing what up but us
Ain't nothing what up but us
We don't allow blunts in the cuts

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Anytime you see me I'm lo'd up
Roll up, light something, than I smoke up
I be steamin', I don't pass really
Nigga be higher than giraffe pussy
That ain't Dour that's a gaffe, rookie
This is Cali not Canadian
These type of buds change whatever mind frame you in
I be so thrown off, what's in them papers got me popped
You think I'm sleepin' but I'm not
Was gonna say somethin', but I forgot
I roll up for breakfast
I be on my J.E.T.S. shit
Me and Spitta smoke a zone it don't be nothin' left it's
George kush I'm on that bomb shit
Hopin' the bag shit smell like armpits
Doesn't matter whose blunts be the longest
When I smoke be potent, hope your lungs is the strongest
My pot heads what up, what up
Spark up nigga, ain't nothing up but us
