[Verse 1: Trademark Da Skydiver]
Highed up, smoking
Chilling in the cut, rolling up, just lokin'
Rubber band knots up in my pants, pockets swollin'
From all this cake I'm holdin'
Getting to this paper, yeah homie I'm on it
Cause I want it and I flaunt it, out here getting it on these bitches too
Flamingo Barnes, yeah it's true
Bitch I'm making major moves
The realest dude in this shit, nothing like them other fools
Paid my dues to be a boss, please don't get Trademark confused
With these lames, out here trying to fill another niggas shoes
Nothing to lose, all to gain, bitch I got a point to prove
Heard they still sleeping on me, fuck it gon' let them snooze
Imma' still be chilling, making a killing, living that jet life fool
So I ain't tripping, I'm still playing my position
Holding it down like I'm supposed to, everyday I'm touching Benj's
Bitches wishing they was with me, now they want me, they used to diss me
And it was nothing for me to come up
Cause that shit that's just in me, nigga

[Hook: Trademark Da Skydiver]
Paper on my mind, money in my bank account
Twenty four- seven, that's all a nigga think about
Stacks upon stacks
Racks upon racks
Rubber bands around my knots, you know I like my pockets fat
Paper on my mind, money in my bank account
Twenty four- seven, that's all a player think about
Stacks upon stacks
Racks upon racks
Rubber bands around my knots, you know I like my pockets fat

[Verse 2: Nesby Phips]
Look, man the paper something else
That steak and shrimp was good, but baby make me something else
The club was popping, but driver take me somewhere else
You've been sitting for thirty years, time to take it off the shelf, and treat yourself
Pop the cork, roll up, and find a torch
It'd be trill if I count this half a mill' on my mama's porch
Put some grands in the Bible at the end of every scripture
Whatever's left I stash it behind my baby pictures
Man, you crazy nigga
Correction, I'm crazy paid
Franky Beverly of the jets, from the set with maze
Camo weighs, from being on a set for days
Crimes will have you chosen, but rhyming will have you paid
With that said, mic check one, two
I confess, anything less then my best won't do
And here's a bit of reinsurance for the clowns that try to doubt me
You still can't see me cause it's too cloudy in the Audi
So I'm high

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Smoke DZA]
Pardon my french, but uh
Sometimes I get kinda
P the D, swag M.C.'s
Rocking that Ralph Lauren hype
Style I call it like I see it G
Them niggas dress like me
Carbon copies, niggas just might be
Really though, you see me ho, Navajo
Bucket low I hold the title, nigga I'm your idol
This flanel here is tribal, these rap niggas don't put it down like I do
Whole bunch of stunting in their viral's
Stunting in my everyday fit, this is everyday shit
Hat's off to Thirst for what he did for Lauren
But rugby was borin' until I wore it, word
Real life I should of been ? stock
Now I'm bout to make denim supply hot
Harlem's what I'm repping, nigga floss to perfection
Winter time flow, get ready for that Thompson collection, DZA
