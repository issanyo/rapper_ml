[Hook]
Knowing every real nigga need a real ass bitch
Knowing every real nigga need a real ass bitch
(I guess a nigga scared of Karma) need a real ass bitch

Uh

[Verse 1]
And you ain’t gotta hide your feelings
Whatever we do girl that’s our business
Without these paint brush I paint these pictures
That’s on my life ima make em feel me
All fearless so much stress built up
Probably every time I get a chance to fuck I beat it up
Or every time she tell me slow it down  speed it up
I was in that kitty like I been locked down for months
I know she hope this night will never end
She say she tryna be way more than friends
But do she love me like she say she does
I'm like who the fuck she take me for
But truth be told you won’t see me tomorrow
A guess a nigga scared of Karma
Sorry love, love don’t live here no more
I know it’s immature to say bros before hoes

[Hook]
Knowing every real nigga need a real ass bitch
Knowing every real nigga need a real ass bitch
Knowing every real nigga need a real ass bitch
Knowing every real nigga need a real ass bitch

[Verse 2]
Held me down since the durag era
Iceberg sweats and cool sweaters
I know love I gotta do better
Open the shutters
Let the sunshine, stash work for a nigga
Never tripped one time
So necessary never worry cause I'm your goto
Harder than most niggas that I know I ain’t go hold you
No a nigga flexing getting to it going global
See it for yourself I ain’t even have to show you
High playing connect four the queen on ma chest board
Take it to the room beat the headboard
So loud had to turn on the speakers
She a keeper, fronting acting like I don’t need her
Knowing every real nigga need a real ass chick
And that’s some real ass shit
True story, I'm tryna get it right
I know some days I could have you tight
I just gotta take my own advice
Knowing

[Hook]
Knowing every real nigga need a real ass bitch
Knowing every real nigga need a real ass bitch
Knowing every real nigga need a real ass bitch
Knowing every real nigga need a real ass bitch
