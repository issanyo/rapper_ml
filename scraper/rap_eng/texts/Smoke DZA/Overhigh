[Verse 1: Smoke dza]
When the dour's in the system
You know how we do it keep puffin and twistin
Thats how we be feelin I'mma chief my bud
Papers no blunts
Dip in the zip and then dump
You only live life once, Rright
Head to Long Beach with my nigga
I dont do the pills
Hit my brodie raulphie know he got the kill
No he keep that potent, shit you wanna keep tokin
Type of shit; you take one hit, and your sweat glance opens
Pupils tear up, mouth get caked up
And you dyin for a drink of water

Verse 2: Trademark Da Skydiver
You wanna roll up a leaf love?
Weell do your thing ma
In the stash I got some hash and some kief as well
She said she dont usually smoke on the first date
But since its her birthday its okay, sweet
So I commence to rollin up
Only papers when im scrollin up
Mama, put away the swisher sweets
Its certain rules you gotta follow when you smoke with me
Especially if I invite you over to smoke for free
Number 1 potency is key
Before we get to 3 here is number 2 this is what we do
That one there for me, this one here for you
I know the tree sticky like superglue
A few hits and youll be floatin right up out your shoes
Mama take a breather
I know youre used to the midsts, this that great sativa
We gettin high passin time of at sandy beaches
So high they cannot reach us oh

[Smoke DZA:]
Rrriight, its mister chief highly, no seeds in my chronic
So breathe mami, this is good weed mami ooh

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Fresh off my meditation
Philly its full of sticky
Gangsta and former hippy
But first to be alone
And while with Shipes, homie break down a dutchie
Mickey lets twist a Ziggy
Call that bitch Biggie biggie
Marijuana clouds, we sittin on
With too much weed to hide
Smellin in my neighbours home
Marijuana clouds, we sittin on
Me and my lungs Cheech and Chongin'
All in the morning before breakfast
In bed and maybe some head, just a little tweak of that tweak
Got me feelin I'm at my peak but i'm
Smoke an eighth, and save some, early mornin'
Wake n' bake 'em As-salamu alaykum
This feelin right heres amazin
So, we gettin blow, legalize dro and uhh slangin' hoes
You know I'm P.I.M.P. ????

[Smoke DZA:]
Rrriight, it's mister chief highly, no seeds in my chronic
So breathe mami, this is good weed mami ooh
No seeds in my chronic
So breathe mami, this is good weed mami ooh
