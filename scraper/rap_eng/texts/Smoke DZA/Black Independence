[Verse 1: J. Ivy]
From the Ivory Coast to Brownsville
Bed-Stuy, St. Louis, Detroit
Memphis, Jackson, Rosewood, Harlem
This is Tulsa before the bombings
Black Wall Street
We haul heat ‘cause we want options
Made it through America’s great adoption
Went from being stuck to getting stacked
Hustling blocks to getting racks
They fashion our design ‘cause we don’t slack
They fear the idea of independence being black

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Riiiight! Uh! What’s the business? I am the business
They give you the fantasy story, here go the realness
If a rapper ain’t doing no shows its probably slow
‘Cause most niggas doing it always be on the road
No 3-60’s less it’s waves spinning
Them whack deals ain’t designed for no niggas winning
I’m over the weak advances
Distribute your own shit, it’s better chances
Fighting the same battle as Ye
But don’t worry, we got the answer, Sway
Invest into your dreams nigga
What I created is what I rock today
Uh, motivated times two
You could do anything you put your mind to
No ownership, it ain’t worth the deal
On my Percy Miller shit, I’ma persevere

[Hook: Smoke DZA]
Black business
Independently ran
Black independence

[Verse 3: J. Ivy]
We make bread, break bread
This is black dollar power
The black dollar hour
I hear cowards saying why y’all talking about getting cash
I want the future to read about us living in the projects in they history class
That’s what I’m on
Trying to get y’all to look past getting on to getting loans
Let’s own the bank
I don’t know about you
But I want my great great great greats to be straight

[Verse 4: Smoke DZA]
Independent as fuck, I own me
Publish shit, merchandise, show money
If I don’t kill my food I won’t eat
You see all my moves, that’s all me
Controlling my own destiny
Knowing the value of my equity
You got to hold your turf
They’ll try to give you what they want, nigga know your worth
Uh, you’ll get what you negotiate
So sticking to your guns is the only way
Successful free agent
Couple homies fighting for they freedom while they caged in
I ain’t tryna be on land caged in
Nah, I’ma need the whole enchilada nigga
God bless you
Criticize but you don’t cut no checks so I respect you
Really can’t tell me shit, look at my credentials

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Jay Ivy]
Imagine a billion black billionaires
Everybody happy, everybody living fair
We ain’t on world dominance, just refuse to be dominated
We will be accommodated
Everything comes around full circle
You can’t mess up the rotation and laws of nature
Tired of putting vacations on layaway and payment plans
Fuck fly kicks, I’m tryna put my feet in the sand
And have enough to pay for land and other land

[Verse 6: Smoke DZA]
I’m my own boss
Touring like 40 days and 40 nights
The tour bus turned into an arc
Who else you know sell out shows in Denmark
No deal, no big co-signs from no stars
Just bars, my G
Sinatra shit, I did it my way and did me
I’m just tryna be a better me
They hate Sean (Ha-tian like Tussaint but they could never rob me from my legacy
They ha-tian like Tussaint but they could never rob me from my legacy
Positive energy
Peace to my brother, Dom Kennedy

[Hook]
