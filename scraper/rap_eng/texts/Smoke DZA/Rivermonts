La Musica De Harry Fraud

Riiiiiiiiight!

[Hook]
Kickin' kickin' up dust in my Polo boots (x4)
Everything that I do be all about the loot (x3)
Kickin' kickin' up dust in my Polo boots (x4)

[Verse 1]
Polo to the jewels, rose gold the jewels
Still get my hands dirty, gotta keep me some Purell
It's a cold world, but the streets is more cruel
I'm just trying to do well, jet life two L's
Nine eleven cartel, money's on
Came a long way from sliding skeezers, smoking reefer
And the honeycombs
Since then, lost friends off envy and hate
Niggas mad because they sell nicks and I sell weight
Coming clean, niggas still be in the trap
Should leave that garbage alone and come and get you a batch
Stompin' through joints still looking fresh
Zippers in the front, laces in the back

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If I die today, remember me like Ralph Lauren
In a denim supplied jacket in bucket looking Harlem
On skully mode, looking rugged, Ronnie Garvin on
Rugby flow, I'm the king, I ain't just talking
I'm about it, just caught a lick
Blew my profit on a closet, scavenging in the store
I ain't seen nothing I ain't buy yet
Damn shame, walk through the mans shame get champagne, true story
I got a little power so I don't pay at the counter
They know when I'm around the store reeking of sour
And just imagine, the pack will get even louder
Don't wonder where I got it, just know that I was slinging
I was:

[Hook]
