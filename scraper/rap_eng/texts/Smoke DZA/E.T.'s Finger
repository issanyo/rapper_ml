[Intro]
Cuz I Felt Like It. That's why
Hey Bronson. I wish you would have called me when you had this one
This is one joint I'm mad I missed. Ya'll killed this but whatever...

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Rugby is getup. Shit, you know threads
I wrote this while I was on the shitter. Rappin' in my head
My nigga told me never give up. Hid me from Feds
I told him, "I got you my nigga. I'mma get this bread"
Lazy niggas ain't tryna get to the scratch
They praying for a lighter load, I'm praying for a stronger back
Know I'mma hold it down
Started it from the half a O and flipped it into some pounds
Old head like it's quiet on the streets
Copped work and then sniffed off of the cross like Priest
He like it's like what weed is for me
I'm like to each my nigga, I'mma stick to these trees
Kushed God give a brief sermon
Three Kings in a cones, nigga keep burnin'
Old school like hotboxin' in the Pathfind
Marijuana totin' 'til I'm flatline
Hello

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Salute to Kushed God, this my type o' talk
I smoke long blunts 'cuz life is short
Thinkin' of a master plan that I am
Praying I ain't gotta revert to O's or back to grams
All my niggas solid, I ain't worried
So if they get snitched up, I ain't scared
Pigs tryna wrap niggas, killas tryna clack niggas
Then you got these hoodrat bitches tryna trap niggas
I smoke loud then I get quiet
Thinkin' bout the nearest bank vault, what's inside it
His block got him gassed up, thinkin' he got it
I turn his future pitch black, make his vision guided
I'm a true Harlem nigga, you'll never see stocks
Bucket on Tilt, cool milk with the T-top
I told my mother wherever I go, I needs pot
So when I die, bury me in the weed spot
