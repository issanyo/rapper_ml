[Verse 1]
Numbers stacked up against me/killin em gently
Since my entry/ how could u ever resent me? Dude im the shit
Fuck the politics/its characters n cosign
Give em dope lines/they say I only give em smoke rhymes
Fuck it, I ain’t gon stop. I ain’t trippin on publications
Givin up slots/or niggas damn near 80 in a office
Tryina tell u whats hot/fuck ya system
Record label prison/I need free doe
I’d rather sip coquito/wit my tan boy people
