[Introduction: Mookie Jones]
Money is not the motivation
But it helps me keep score
Honestly I enjoy playign the game much more
This politics that im positive that I'mma make mayor
You players play great but I'm a great player
I hate haters, but love the flip its like the rush you get
When its out you hand before your used to get touchin it
Until the day im fuckin rich I'll be:

[Hook: Mookie Jones]
Hustle in the house I hustle out I'm hustlin
I get it in, traveling i wanna win
You know im gonna win (2x)

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
I'm out gotta tend to these stacks
I be gone till November dont worry boo I'll be back
Baby whip up them tears and hit me up on the jack
You see the amor bags from louie ain't got you that
Don't trip I know you prolly miss a nigga in the bed at night
But i gotta make moves im on the red eye flight
Tour life
I'm in Amsterdam tonight, the kids can't sleep till they see me on skype
I do this shit for them, a nigga gotta win, cakin' off these shows
And still gotta case a nigga 110, on the low, im all in, tickets low
Shit got tight boring when the shit got slow
I do me, handle my duty, while you chase booty, i chase bread nigga bout to sell a movie
Homie all that big money talk dont move me
Winning, verse the same price as a QP

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
25/8 on it
Broke nights tryna get it broke bread with my niggas
Big risk but it was for the cause
Nigga from the start to the finish always handlin my business
In a week ill be at the connects door
Need more raw, flow coming its more in store
Shit is picking up
Look a the money, it's staring to pour in
Run with it till I'm done with it
Know I got the poem so come get it
The kush came the piff went
We was having fun with it
We bubblin' enjoying the run
Because you know the money goes just as fast as it comes
Gotta stash your funds, shit happens untimely
In case a rainy day turn into a tsunami
Have you ever dodged the county?
It's cold out here for a hustler
The system trying to do a nigga in
But nigga they won't ever put me down
I forever be around so in the long run nigga I win
