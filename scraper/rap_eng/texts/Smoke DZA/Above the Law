[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Just pulled away from the cocaine press
The Marina EP still being perfected
See my nigga it's a process
I can share my recipe with you minus a couple steps
Gotta keep some of that game to myself
Some of y'all niggas too lame and don't deserve the share in the wealth
I heard they coming for my neck, I bought another chain
My youngins at the range and they working on their aim
They telling me to chill shit ain't never that real
For the big dog that had to step on the field
I said I dig, yelling still if it was a walk
And it was time to ride, I know they'll be in the car
Ready to hop out and fire wherever enemies are
It get ridiculous when cash is involved
Contractor designed the crib so we can hide them stacks in the wall
Highed up above the law
Highed up I want some cars
Highed up I want it all
All the shit I ever saw

[Hook: Curren$y]
Just pulled away from the cocaine press
The Marina EP still being perfected
See my nigga it's a process
I can share my recipe with you, minus a couple of steps
I can share my recipe with you, minus a couple of steps
Gotta keep some of that game to myself
Some of that game to myself, some of that game to myself
My youngins at the range and they working on their aim
They working on their aim, work-working on their aim

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Set the stage, another bag, another plane
My hippy bitches burning sage
We gave 'em classic jams to blaze to
It's phase 2, twist another bagel
We tuned into the architects, hustlers, stay cool
Free bitch, you fuck around and blow the trial
Think she upper class, she selling pussy in denial
Use the same mouth to kiss a child
She ain't for you, she for the game and expensive dinners from Chow's
Hand flickas bottle service need another round
Heard they coming for my head, I bought another crown
Endlessly twisting something loud
On this 8th grade high and I ain't coming down
Sometimes a L is the only way to gain
The irony when winning is the object of the game
Apply pressure, give 'em pain
Iceberg big, Andretti, nigga planes

[Hook: Curren$y]
Just pulled away from the cocaine press
The Marina EP still ain't been perfected
See my nigga it's a process
I can share my recipe with you man, it's a couple steps
I can share my recipe with you man, it's a couple steps
Gotta keep some of that game to myself
Some of that game to myself, some of that game to myself
