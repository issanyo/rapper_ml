[Intro]
Right, It's god like, THC
Smoke DZA Lex Luger niggas scared of that

[Hook:2x]
I'm loaded, i'm on one
Why you sitting there sober, shorty roll something
Light it up,light it up, light it up, light it up

[Verse 1]
You now tuned in to the next up/You niggas finessed up
Game time, nigga, with my production straight from Lexus
Hot shit homie got enough to give a best of
You know i'm that nigga, fam stop hating and just fess up
Kush god, your royal highness
I'm a cold motherfucka, bout to boost the climate
Harlems' finest, Soon to be world renowned
Everywhere's a smoke section where we at. Lets burn it down
Let em know, DZA's in the building, dour's in the air
Champaigne popping, bad bitches everywhere, we go
Vintage flow for you young ass niggas
And this is fly 101 for you bum ass niggas
Never been no where, talking bout the fly shit they do
That's cool, if only the fly shit was true
Touchdown in your city and them hoes be loose
I'm in room 420 tell them fall through

[Hook:2x]

[Verse 2]
You sititng there looking useless, roll up, quit playing
Fam, we make the rules and we dont care bout what you saying
Look I'm George Kush, president of flow-ers
Say you adamant, I ain't having it and my cabinet on some savage shit
Cinematic business, gonna turn me into a vulture
GFC lifestyle, God Family Culture
Everthing is kosher, watch me do what I do
Cuz regardless, these little niggas couldn't touch my cool
I'm that dude, nigga I'm on the scene, blowing the bombest green
While them niggas over there geekin on that Charlie Sheen
You niggas trippin, get the fuck from 'round me
Shorty said she don't smoke but she wanna try a brownie
High Life, see how that feels
She been out for 4 hours. Damn that naps real
I'm bout to roll up another one; lay back, chill
I blew an ounce but Hunch got a half still

[Hook:2x]
