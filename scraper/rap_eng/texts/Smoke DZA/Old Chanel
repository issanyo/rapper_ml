[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Gold teeth and a snapback
Camo shorts, high socks and hoodies
Animal print Joyrich backpack
Keep a Raw cone stuffed with goodie
Eyes low as hell, I rock old Chanel
Smell the kush smoke on my mink
Jacuzzi bubbles on my Cuban link
Sipping champagne, smoking marijuana
Every finger got a ring
You can tell just by our slang
Native print and skinny pants, young Americana
Two Cs on my frame, eating pasta with my team

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
(Pull up in a Porsche
Beverly Hills, smoking that weed)

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Riiiiightt
I do 'Lo as well
With all this double RL and Rugby, ain’t hard to tell
Polo Sport, nigga I'm on the field (coasting)
No Karo, we cracked the seal
Gotta make sure the act is real
Don't fingerfuck the bud, the pack is real
Fans hyped cause they lit us up
I'm high, don't really give a fuck
I Usain Bolt through Denim & Supply
I'm seasons ahead, you couldn't catch me if you tried
I run my lane so hard, my feet swell up
Continuous waves, word to my sea dweller
'Lo bears, I got so many
Foamposites like I know Penny
Bombay, no Henny
Keep nelly in that old Chanelly
Keep her earrings flooded and her wrists heavy
So when them bitches come through with them fake Speedy she laughin'
RLX'd up, like I came from the Aspens
DZA

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
That new BBC Barney's collab came out
I ordered me one, lit one up and got happy as fuck
Shout out to the niggas swagging me up
Cause now you think I get this shit off the back of a truck
I got so much of it
Flaunting pieces - one of a kind custom shit
Going on trips, I hope my luggage fit
You only rock it cause it got two Gs on it
My wife bag cost 6 G’s and got them two C’s on it
Plus, I'm smoking well
My outfit dope as hell
Trying to find out what I'm rocking to the Grammy's
Put that iPhone down fool, don't try to Instagram me
That's ho shit

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
I rock old Chanel, old Chanel
