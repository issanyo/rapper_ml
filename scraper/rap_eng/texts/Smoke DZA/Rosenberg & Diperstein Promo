[Peter Rosenberg]
Ladies and gentlemen, the sound you're listening to
Is of the greatest hip-hop DJ on planet Earth
The man who made wrestling cool again
The man who made hip-hop what it is in New York City and worldwide
A man who as we speak is in the backseat of a limo
Going VIP to Wrestlemania 31
With my brother, Smoke DZA
Listen closely you peasant pieces of shit
He will squash you
And he won't even wipe you up with his robe
He will spit on the ground next to your ashes
He's Smoke fucking DZA
Its Ringside 3
Peter Rosenberg
Live from California, you know what time it is
Matter of fact
I'm gonna have my agent
My major top-level Hollywood agent
Say a quick line about Smoke DZA
Dip

[Diperstein]
Smoke DZA is major

[Peter Rosenberg]
Thank you and goodnight
