[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Say less, don't want no fuckboi, huh
Say less, you wanna shop all day

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
You want a real one, huh
Say less, don't want no broke boy, huh
Say less, you wanna shop all day
Say less, you want it all your way
You get it all your way, no, oh, oh
You get it all your way, ow, ow, yeah

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Right
Say word, you won't tell me what you fake heard (heard)
Nothing matter 'cept for you when it's paper (word)
PETA ain't comin' for them bitches, man, that's fake fur
I'll go kill the shit myself and get you laced up
'Cause I just, wanna love you, the way that you wanna be loved
Travel places you ain't too fond of, Patróned up
We fogged up, you long club
Now you pull up on your friends (right)
Cartier your lenses (right)
Fuck up Gucci, for the culture, took it on a jet (right)
Whether time or dollars, you know all we do is spend (right)
All that losin' you been doin', now it's time to win, perfect
You don't need no flat tummy cleanse
Tell 'em hold the tea 'cause you's a perfect 10
Greatest of all time, family is all fine
My style genuine, girl, I love you long time

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
You want a real one, huh
Say less, don't want no broke boy, huh
Say less, you wanna shop all day
Say less, you want it all your way
You get it all your way, no, oh, oh
You get it all your way, ow, ow, yeah

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
All the thotties wear Louis, she more comfy in her slides
Connoisseur, mature, Dior type of fly
Commodore cigars, Macallan with no ice
No gettin' sauce, endorse a ratchet TV night
Laugh, experience life, we too young to be angry and hyped
We ain't perfect but our future is bright
And even imperfection is perfection inside
Fuck all the perception and social media likes
Livin' right, body tight, pretty face (right)
Perfect height, just my type (right)
No baggage claim just smarter flights (right)
Citation vibes (right)
Don't pack no bags, we back tonight, travel light (right)
Shorty scrap the wine and the candle light, we gettin' wild tonight
It's alright with you, she say, "Really fuckin' cool, déjà vu "
The blunt spark, Mike Amiri when we floss
Pissy we been drinkin' dark
The world is yours

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
You want a real one, huh
Say less, don't want no broke boy, huh
Say less, you wanna shop all day
Say less, you want it all your way
You get it all your way, no, oh, oh
You get it all your way, ow, ow, yeah
