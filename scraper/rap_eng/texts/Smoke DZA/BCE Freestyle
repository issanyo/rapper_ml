[Intro]
Kushgod bitch, Kony
Wallace what's good
One time for my bro DJ Wally Sparks, one time
Before I get into this shout out to all my gods in New York
That Sandy thing.... lost power, can't find gas.... shit real out here
I feel your pain I went through it too
Riiiiiiiight

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
I'mma king, I'mma God, I'm your fucking idol
Above man, nigga Satan is my only rival
That's my word, you can quote it like it's from The Bible
It's my time, my turn in the cycle
They took the safe route, I took the cake route
Stu flow, Philippe Chow wanna take out
Kushgod, one and only King of New York just call me Kony
Laying the smack down on you jabronies
Stay to myself everybody's phoney
Get some paper, niggas faces be like Mike Brown when they call fouls on Kobe
I said Kony, niggas said nothing
Purple label cashmere with the grey buttons
Hurricanes in my city that shit is mad wack
No gas, closest thing to 93 is Joey Badass
I'm bad ass, a man made natural disaster
Till my jersey hang in the rafters, I'm in the hood and I'm active
Ralph discontinued rugby, what a shame
Thompson line 'bout to drop, 'bout to rock my own things
Kushgod, Bob Marley on my chain
This ain't Jesus smoking weed, motherfucker what you think

[Hook: Smoke DZA]
This goes out to all the dudes that use
Disrespectful views on the king of NY
If it's beef why try, I put rings on ya eyes
I ain't a king then I wanna know why
I said this goes out to all the dudes that use
Disrespectful views on the king of NY
If it's beef why try, I put rings on ya eyes
I ain't a king then I wanna know why

Riiiiiight
Kushgod bitch.... RFC.... 911, Jet Life
Flying over everything nigga.... yeah
Once again, one time for my brother Wally Sparks
Now spark one up
Riiiiiight
