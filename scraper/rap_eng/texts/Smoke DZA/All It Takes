[Intro: Smoke DZA]

Kush God Bitch!
I'mma need a ten piece from Harold's mild sauce
Make sure the fries is crispy and all that
Locate the uber take 'em to CBS
Make sure you get me all the dutches in that motherfucker
Smokin' this whole pack whatever I don't smoke I'm taking home
I play like that
RIGHT!

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Fuck the hold up what's the hold up keep it capital G
Blow a donut nigga roll up when you listen to me
It's the god nigga, kushed god see me strutting through the fog nigga
All hail, shit my cartel full of kings
Made men pulling strings
Sons of anarchy kind of things
Stoner spirituals, hustler hymns
Sermons'll have you burning stuff some wax in your pen
I'm el plaga I say it once and I don't say it again
Fuck what you saying you ain't playing unless you playing to win
Unanounced walk in your house, light up in your living room
Ash on your couch, take your lighter and bounce
Nigga rolled in, rolled out, blowing lethal
My cologne is tuscan leather and sour diesel
Classic, classic apple like the cobble streets
I'm the best nigga here in all honesty
In all honesty fuck the politics save the politics for politicians [?]
Ain't no denying it's great, been a loser all your life take this L to the face


[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
I put me on
Go ahead play yourself like Leon
Get the tables Devaughn
It's the Kushed God reborn
Resurrected on a 8th blue bud the whole day created clouds
There will never be a drought
Not in my world so much stake might have gout
And I'm a [?] like fuck the [?] I don't know if that's chicken
Betting against DZA I don't know what they thinking
Fuck what it seems get out of my jeans,off my dick
Visit Supreme they buckets is mean cop all 'em
Blow herb on stage, then get payed
Young OG, son niggas twice my age
Front on me, don't do it
Rip you apart make you look so stupid
Cigars in the freezer
Strawberitas for the thots trying to glow
Fucking peons throwing rocks at the throne
