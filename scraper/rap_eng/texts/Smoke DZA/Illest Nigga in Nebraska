[Verse 1]
RFC/Smoke….DZA
Lo key nigga had the P’s out in PA
Ball out/it ain’t a game. No EA
Blow cake/ everyday is my b-day
Uh...have them million dollar convos
Chanel bracelets on my mom glow
Holla at blanco…..
Sea dweller of the presie/that’s a lemon to a lime tho
The sour got my mind blown
Plus the shit that I’m on bout to suffocate you ‘cabrons
Thou shall not fuck wit Rugby Thompson
Feel a couple shots form the Thompson UHH
I been a don since my humble beginnings
Don‘t give a fuck about you niggas opinions
Travel the world and I made it a livin
Kush God/I got the world as my minons UHH

[Verse 2]
Got a bad bitch just to transport things
IPhone till she had android dreams
I’m everywhere/you just can’t ‘void me
You niggas been getting jook’d since Jansport strings
I been sleek since the key
Had gold chains when I was hoppin trains
Had the plug way before I even chief’d
Call me Sunny Bono/I just run into the tree
Pack lamb/move that/gotta do that
Giant like Eli/breeze thru like who dat
True dat/PC got me iced up
Rare foams that you can’t find in flight club
I’m poppin now the price up
If u can’t see I’m that nigga/then ya sight suck
Kill these niggas blindfolded
Money got my mind on it/big checks; sign on it
