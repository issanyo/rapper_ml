[Verse 1:]
Uptown get the money
Home a the shakers
Whole lota hoes, long live the players
Whole lota brag, get to the paper
OG from from chachi, soul food from Jacobs
This how I do it, sermons while I burn on
Lil niggas hold burners in they murmurs
Youth gon wild as a mod
Send em on a mission only one is a dub
Bitches show me love
Keep her excited
OC trips, passport expedited
Everything I touch gold
Touch ever minus
Rollin at strong
You know I stay kitted
Right

[Pre-Chorus:]
It’s cool you can roll up right here
Live life you don’t have a care
Champagne like everyday’s new year
It’s on deck ova here

[Chorus]
Errythang valid[x4]

[Verse 2:]
Blowin on so loud
Might wake up the neighbours
Steady on the prowl
Ain't no time to lay up
Invited to the party, bottles and they pay us
This picture worth a million no filters see me player
Errything valid, niggas just be poppin shit
But i’m way more worried about the stop and frisk
Shorty got the fatty mighta copped her shit
Like she needed transportation, how she hopped on dick
Watch on risk, day day stary K
Tell these fools I ain't about play play vaca
Killin these niggas Tim Duncan, straight face
24/7 I don’t take no breaks

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
