[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
I just can't say no, I just can't say no, I just can't say no

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Riiiiiiiggghhtt
16 bars of death
Keep my posites on they neck
I'm a really fuckin' cool fly nigga i'm a jet
You a bird ass nigga who be shittin' in your nest
Every line is bullet nigga I hope you got your vest
Mad? Niggas stay mad at me haters in form of flattery
Fuck nigga give Liu Kang fatalities
I ain't never worry, a real nigga ain't gotta say he a real nigga
Cuz, niggas know already
Talk grease but I'm your favorite ar-tist
Every verse is funeral i'm a walking Ortiz
Kush God speed, your chick fuck with them gangsters she raunchy
That's on me
You cuff em up cause she a bad girl
Pop off with a nigga she a fast fuck
Threw the cake in my face
Told me Happy Birthday, show mad love
Mash-up, roll up, smoke mad bud
Then I be Casper after a blow job and a back rub
DZA

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
I just can't say no, I just can't say no, I just can't say no

I'm giving out hearses, I'm giving out hearses, yeah

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Look
What the fuck you gon' say about me?
Can you tell em I'm the same OG?
I smoke weed, get high, keep it locked I stay low key
Why don't you mind your fuckin' business
Respect the HNIC
Replace the N and C with two eyes and you'll see me
Throwin' up the fuckin three
Three letters, TDE
And that's for eternity
Kush God and the God MC
Once again, but it's more to see
You might have been to sea world
But have you really seen the world
Do you ask yourself these type of things
Solar system don't go against him
There is no one else alike
Used to have them pipe dreams
Now bitches dream about my pipe
But now we onto bigger things
Reaching peaks and different heights
Women that do different things, still got lean all in my sprite
Fuck life I'm going all out
It's your broad's house, and my balls out
I got demons in my life, I need Jesus in my life
But I ain't sipping wine, I'll be fine Popping Champagne
And we'll bring pain to your camp
If you don't join the campaign

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
I just can't say no, I just can't say no, I just can't say no
I just can't say no, I just can't say no
Let 'em know that i'm giving out hearses
That I'm giving out hearses, yeah
I'm giving out hearses, I'm giving out hearses, yeah

[Verse 3: Smoke DZA]
Another vehicular homicide, Chris Dorner sniper lies
Sandy Hook, Columbine, minus the crisis actors
You niggas born slackers, your voice don't even matter
So mute the chatter, fuckin rappers
This that flow they mic jack, 'This Is It' nigga
Don't watch me, watch my neck and how my wrist lit up
I came back from mines on you jabronis, i don't mingle with you phonies
Bitch I'm K.O.N.Y, Alcatraz on the track
Attack like a savage cat
Undertaker, this the casket match
Pallbearer bring the urn out
They won't win til we quit, we don't burn out
DZA

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
I just can't say no, I just can't say no, I just can't say no
I just can't say no, I just can't say no
Let 'em know that i'm giving out hearses
That I'm giving out hearses, yeah
I'm giving out hearses, I'm giving out hearses, yeah

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
Yeah
