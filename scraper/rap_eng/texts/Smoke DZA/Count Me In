[Verse 1]
I'ma need a couple mills
They ain't talking bucks for real
Put my own album out, got me like "fuck a deal"
I'ma keep it trucking still til I get this duffel filled
I don't need no validations dude, I know I'm fucking ill
Woke up from a good dream, went outside and lived through
My life is like a movie when I sleep I get to preview you
Still want to be a kingpin, all types of random thinking
Flow sold millions, shouts to Sean Kingston
Ask about my inkpen, they think I just got loopy
Already was in the building now on top of it like Snoopy
Really fucking cooling in spots they won't let you up in
And still got the bud next door like Rudy friend

[Hook]
I dream, I zone, achieve some mo'
I dream, I zone, achieve some mo'
I dream, I zone, achieve some mo'
I ain't got no time to talk unless it's about some dough
Count me in ho
Count me in (Right)
Then count me in ho
Count me in (Right)
Then count me in ho
Count me in (Right)
Count me in ho
Then count me in (Right)
Dream dream dream dream dream dream dream dream
Zone zone zone zone zone zone zone zone zone zone zone
Achieve achieve achieve achieve achieve achieve achieve achieve achieve achieve

[Verse 2]
Woke up in a cold sweat thinking about cold cash
Money under mattress plinking on my whole stash
Travel like a nomad, home still home though
Get paid to travel, it's never pro bono
Stunting in my polo, R-I-P my rugby--clean
Now I got the designer designing shit on my team
Started as a dream til I stopped dreaming much
Really just my thoughts, my reality is real as fuck
Still ain't seen enough, still more green to touch
Really fucking cool nigga, make the world believe in us
Standing on my own two, motherfuck the waiting game
The big kahuna nigga, give you fools endless wage

[Hook]
