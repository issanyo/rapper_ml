[Verse 1: Young Roddy]
And I'm waiting on my come-up, still waiting on my come-up
Told homie "Put the gun down my nigga why don't you try to learn something?"
Told homie "Fuck a handout why don't you try to earn something?"
What I eat don't make you shit so I don't owe the motherfucker nothing
But they keep on testing my fate, keep on testing my fate
Like everytime a nigga tour the world, I hear another homie got sprayed
I ain't going back to that trap life I'm like no how no way
My granny always pray she hope that no trouble come my way
But it's hard not to kill niggas,so hard to kill niggas
Spitta told me don't spare no clowns go hard on a bitch nigga
All I got is my word, my hood, good sense and Jet Life Familia
I used to dribble my Spalding while up the block, them niggas was killing
And I sure don't know what's that over but I bet it ain't nothing serious
Niggas throw crosses up in my city, nothing but coffins up in my city
But if you ask me them niggas bugging
My uncle taught me how to get that money

[Hook: Young Roddy]
Let's get that money, gotta get that money
Gotta get that money, let's get that money
Let's get that money, gotta get that money
Gotta get that money, let's get that money

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
I'm naturally cool that's what most of them lack
It ain't bout where you from it's where you at
George Kush, I wrote the hustler's manual front to back
They call it the trap because we trapped
Can't get out, work on me, bagging up with my hombre
Busting moves in that Hond-ay,burn the city down like Pompeii
All day, no shame but they acknowledge it
Fuck your block I might buy that shit, Charles Rangel hood politics
They pop alot of shit but who really getting ends?
You spend your time on the internet, nigga I just spend
And through all that chitter chat I look at Billboards like where these niggas at?
Constantly gotta remind these niggas, social networks the only place you find these niggas
I'm a King of my city, I'm a king all across the nation
This music gon live nigga, we the never die cooperation
Pop more shit nigga bout getting change before Obama was in office
Everyday another offer, back to the money, bitch i'm off this

[Hook: Young Roddy]
