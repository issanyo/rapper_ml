[Verse 1]
Terry Richardson shoot peace sign when I pose
Cheeks smiling so hard my eyes closed
Red carpet treatment where I go
Get money living out your life goals
Fraudy love when I talk that fly shit let me talk that fly shit
I'm in Nanc', France eating crossaints
Bad bitches want to fall through the show I got comps
Supreme whites I only rock the ones
Only get two years for launch
Cigar ball like a don
Fresh porter house steaks like they just took the cow off the farm
Took a limp for my pops but I'm glad he alive
Got him the best prosthetic leg money can buy, now that's fly
I'm in a whole 'nother jurisdiction I'm on my second passport
You worried about other niggas that's mad pause

[Hook]
Its for the brothers and hustlers that understand it
For all my niggas that thought they would hit the ball but get remanded
Smoking the best og in the world from San Fran kid
Bout to roll up another one
And this one's for you
This one's for you

[Verse 2]
Higher than Doc Ellis minus the rollers
Sweetest aroma the finest I rolled up
Groupie love bring more months but take them hoes' phone before we go up
Might try to James Harden a nigga
We off Patron dub good view facing the river
Good robe on the one just came from the tailor
My white low boxes got a little mascara on 'em
They trying to ride the wave go sailor on 'em, how so
Most these niggas on BALCO, they cheating
Its foot on the neck season all over again
No air to breath I'm closing all of the vents
And fuck all your corny events
I'm throwing all you weirdos in the trench
And swim with the fishes

[Hook]
Its for the brothers and hustlers that understand it
For all my niggas that that's bout to hit the ball but get remanded
Smoking the best og in the world from San Fran kid
Bout to roll up another one
And this one's for you
This one's for you
This one's for you
I said this one's for you
