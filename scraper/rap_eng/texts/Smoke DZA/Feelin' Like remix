Smoke DZA (intro)

“Right Kush God Bitch! Really ! G5 whats really? Nigga mad hype!”


Verse 1 [Smoke DZA]
Uh Since when a slacker give you good advice?
Feelin’ like what I’m looking like, I just got another bag, my bank account looking right
Went premium from eating Denny’s dinner, separate all the heavy slingers from penny pinchers
If any winners its us we them guys to begin with Kush God Body nigga the sky’s the limit
Another day in Harlem picture me designered out high fashion hood rat bitches giving all kind of mouth
Big dog A1 pedigree all kind of clout rap niggas steal from the nine still a pound you out
Backwood twisting I’m on my fifth pack, OG buzz thats a big fact remember when them diddy’s went for six racks ya pot head dreams I’ve done lived that

Hook [G5 Elz & Bridget Perez]
Eighty on the dash got me feeling nice new car wash got me cursing like
Might hit corner spin the block twice last I time did that it caused a fist-fight
Got me feeling like feeling like feeling like feeling like summer days got me feeling like
Got me feeling like feeling like feeling like feeling like summer days got me
Feeling like


Verse 2 [G5 Elz]
Looking for a summer boo caramel wit attitude leaning the beam double parked on the avenue
This ain’t a Hanes white tee its international, Japanese or Italian type of attributes
Air’s outta Flight Club, kids pulling their bikes up
Nosey neighbors calling the cops cause they don’t like us
Bow WoW niggas in the rentals with no license, little girls double dutching til’ the night come
I'm Bamz wit da tan, cooking out with the fam
Never eating franks leave them thangs in da pan feelin’ like August nights and cracked windows nutcrackers same color as flamingos
You can tell he paid in Versace shades
Bitches yell his name from a block away I'm the reason for barricades
Be this way til’ leafs hit da air no pair of ye’s

Hook [G5 Elz & Bridget Perez]
Eighty on the dash got me feeling nice new car wash got me cursing like
Might hit corner spin the block twice last I time did that it caused a fist-fight
Got me feeling like feeling like feeling like feeling like summer days got me feeling like
Got me feeling like feeling like feeling like feeling like summer days got me
Feeling like
