Fat bastard twisting up a dutch faster
Fat bastard twisting up a Dutch Master
Fat bastard twisting up a dutch faster
Fat bastard twisting up a Dutch Master

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
I put myself in my top five greatest rappers alive
Iâ€™m competing with ghost rapping to posters of niggas that died
I'm the one, word to Fay on this my studio sessions is seances
Kushed God sermons at my concerts
I came here to conquer, mantra, think of a bunch of
Double entendres, you ponder, I'm just warmed up
Dabbing with the captain nigga, lungs hurt how I'm feeling?
Higher than any nigga on earth my answer be prey or be hunter
This message is sponsored by
A New York nigga, real nigga worldwide
Kony nigga, still in the hood with the shooters
My shit bang in Houston, like Pimp C produced it
Kick game is stupid, I stay in exclusives
Slick talk fluent nigga I really do this
Forreal you online for the Bordeaux's
I'm on a first class line, bout to board tho

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Lyrically, I'm one of the most inclined immaculate
The swank stay accurate
Pass the spliff, my taste stay dank when the dutch masters lit
Ain't much that matters with the rapper wiz kid
Put a bid on my bitch
So the baby baller just could dribble and shit
The spoiled brat, who in the bigger crib
I'm bout to dig on a picnic
Tryna to get rid of me
They trying to make me slit another wrist and imprison me
You ain't even gotta ask the risk of fucking with the young asterisk
So spectular with this rapper shit
I'm coming for your necks nigga, Drake Dracula
That's a fact, got my city on my back
I'm way across the map
Crushing on that reggie bush until it's flat

[Verse 3: Smoke DZA]
Bagging up on my ottoman
Before my introduction, middle finger in my sonogram
See the big picture, all I need is Big L hologram
Hustle like them niggas in a dollar van
Fuck them niggas hollerin'
Rolling something healthy, play the hand that they dealt me
Living nigga, you trying to get likes taking selfies
I made the name mean something show gratitude
Instead of being a bunch of Tammy Romans old bitches with attitudes
I'm already made, and I'm really fucking cool on that shit anyway
Anyway...
