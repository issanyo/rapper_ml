[Intro]
We off to the races
183rd Street
It's what we do
R6
Kushed God, bitch
Had to take this time to tell all you niggas
It's over
Hahahaha

[Hook]
Uh, I ain't takin' no shorts, either
You fuckin' with the boy, other
I ain't hearin' no noise either
Delete the shit out of one of you niggas
I ain't takin' no shorts, either
You fuckin' with the boy, other
I ain't hearin' no noise, uh
Yes

[Verse]
Uh, rock to sleep
Unlimited hands and feet
How I kick it, soccer league
Competition obsolete
Bar for bar, I'm the goddamn one
Flyin' 'round higher than Vanguard 1
You lookin' at the man, bar none
Charge 'em double, we's the fanboys, son
They ain't hear this type of talk in a while
Delete, survive, procure, I shall
Bad news had me down for some months
Seven dyin', he talkin' to me in blunts
OG regeneratin' my vessel
If I'ma do it, make sure that it's special
And won't trip (don't trip)
Your whole advance in one fit
Out the lake, a reincarnation with one zip
Hold up, I'ma do this forever
The House of DZA, ain't nobody this clever
Huh, give 'em a standin' ovation
This broken brilliance takin' over, I'm sayin'

[Skit]
Yeah, for millennia, my soul has wandered
Through space and time
But not all who wander are lost
I am well versed in all facets of the multiverse
I have studied at the Library of Alexandria
Battled alongside Genghis Khan
Danced with the Hydra
Held symposiums with Plato
And meditated atop the Great Pyramid of Giza
