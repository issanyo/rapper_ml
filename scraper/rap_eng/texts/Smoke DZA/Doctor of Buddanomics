[Intro]
Right
Don't try this at home
Uh

[Verse 1]
The doctor of buddanomics, probably burnt a forest
Word, life I'm flawless, Imma win regardless
Image they tried to tarnish 'cause I keep it honest
Hustle, respect, and loyalty, handle our business accordingly
Stack some bread for the lawyer fees
You can't see me to judge
Always notice the phony shit
They be calling it love
Posers, tough guys, they will never see me budge
Five knuckle shuffle all of the above
Movies, endorsements, stack cheddar
Rivals come, tidal runs, bad bella
Uh
Fact fella I'm the franchise
Can't fit my shoes or my pants size
Salute the real ones I'm still anti
Went on the flow Vampiro and still got them grams
Bye
Always on a flight never standby
I'm a stoner light the L up on your campfire

[Outro]
Take that beat off right here before your eyes
All you women want me
I'm the envy of all guys
Your girls with us
I'm about to find her bra size
I don't care who I piss off
From Stephanie McMahon straight over to Eric Bishoff
We never soft
We never leave a man standing
You either deal with me
Or with bling-bling Buchanan
We the man son
And we attacking this arrangement
The new centerpiece of World Wrestling Entertainment
