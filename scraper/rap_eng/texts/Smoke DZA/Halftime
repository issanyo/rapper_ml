[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
I said it's like that, I said it's like that
I got some bread, I got some work, I got the right batch
My nigga Honch he got one lit and I got head like that
If you my pinky, watch the bling ain't hard to sight that
Before I made stocks with David and Dennis to get my shine up there
I was just a diamond in the rough in designer gear
9/11 I put on before the raps
I'm a foam head getting fly, you ain't known for that
You the type I probably hit with a charity pack
Fuck the hot shit, shit my genre reality rap
Nigga I'm casually lax
Kush God but in reality I'm actually that
You'll never catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
They want they bust all legit on a nigga's feature
Low kay with the gallon shit it's yak time
Hit me on the batline
It's Halftime
