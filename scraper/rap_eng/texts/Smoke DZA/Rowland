[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Rolling up a seal, blowin' up but still
Going hard on my job like I ain't sitting on a mill
Now filet mignon come with every meal
I swear to God that I'm so high, feel like I'm going up a hill
Car marijuana coated
Paid 250,000 for it, still hop in that thing, ride like I stole it
I'm talking vacation island resorting
I made eleven million nigga without any endorsements
Took the niggas out I was out on the porch with
To Saint Tropes to race them in Audis and Porsches
Bentleys and rolls, plenty of smoke
Thousands for weed, Fendi's for clothes
I remember I couldn't get shit back then when I was broke
Now that I'm rich, everything's for the low
So I could give a fuck 'bout what they saying
Cause they wasn't with me way back when a nigga was just

Riiiiightt
We living life shit, the bud is never ending
Kush God Bob Marley on my pendant
You know that lo is the life that I'm living
Ralph Lauren always keep a nigga spending, word
I can't lie, it's the truth, a stack for these joints
Five-hundred a boot, double R L I don't do Trues
That ain't for me
Getting money killing shows in the home of the maple leaf
These rap niggas live in a land of make-believe
Jimmity Cricket ass niggas and cool enough to fool with us
Nah, cool table geeks play the back, haters play the side door
Jet Life, Taylor Gang what you ride for
We keeping the ends, competition is slim
In case you looking for them niggas, have no fear, we are them
Corner the market, getting money, Rolling Stoned
Young Khalifa, rugby rohdes, riight

And young rappers might be like
Well, he's a veteran, signed to a young guy
Everybody seems to have an opinion on...

We all grew up on Three Six in Pittsburgh
And anybody who don't understand it or don't see it
It's just cause they aren't meant to
They aren't built, they don't have the mind capacity
To understand that this motherfucker
Influenced everything I do up until this point
As far as songwriting, as far as beat selection
As far as all of that shit
