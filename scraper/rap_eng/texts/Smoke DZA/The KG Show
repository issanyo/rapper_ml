[Intro]
Really
Smoker shit
183rd Street

[Verse]
I do this for the go-getters
Curve to the gold diggers
You talkin' to the KG Show, nigga
My Bike Life niggas with 4-wheelers
Comin' to the hood, I'm on post with it
Whatever spot, I do the most with it
I pop up, power bomb, I'm prolific
Prize fighter for money, my eyes light up
I'm back with a full clip, back on my pulpit runnin'
Send Tom through the bullshit, right
I'd rather be a wine seller in Scandinavia
Big blunts, big clouds all in the area
Kushed God, he's a myth, fuck it, they made me up
Super kick, Pat take 'em to KO Mania
Ringside or ring apron if you're feelin' tough
Fuck it, repeat the process, they ain't scared enough
I earn mine, I am not an inheriter
Right, it's the new face of America

[Skit]
You have to worry about running here or running there to make sure you don't lose the title
Because the only person that's going through that commentator's table is you
