[Verse 1]
You know I wake and bake roll all this up
Sip peppermint tea out my polo mug
Smell it stinkin' through the doors niggas know it's us
Spray some Ozium 'fore this old bitch let the po po up
Relax still, not trill
Everyday's the best day ever word to Mac Mills
I light a forest UPS here
It's from Lauren
August just got a box full of fall shit
Right, admire the patch
We ain't official with thirst and so it's quiet for that
Love and loyalty I got inspired off that
And in real life I am who I am on my raps, nigga
Diggin' a ditch that's just everyday DZA
Honestly you niggas need to thank him
Like an old Langston oldheads be stankin' me
Like thirty somethin' so we let the old boy spank him

[Hook]
Right, niggas hate when you established
They don't work hard but wanna have it
Conversation cut shorter than the grass is
Trynna use a nigga so they ass kiss
But it's quiet for you niggas
Shhh
It's quiet for you niggas
Shhh

[Verse 2]
No more comparin' shit it's quiet for that
There's only one Smoke DZA no lyin' in that
I make the ground shake, I'm a tyrant in fact
Fuck them doughboys supplying you crack
Figuratively speaking I serve em frequent
All seasons stay recent never make em wait
Like a visit in the beacon
Seeing is believing
Dreams I'm achieving
Knew I was that nigga when I used to rock the [?]
With the uniform
I was a fly little guy way before I was on
True story got em all icy form the Jola
Shit on your little friend Mula
Hop in the drop take off like Ferris Bueller
Ridin' to riches with the top down
Wind damn near blew my bucket off my head
It ain't bout the popularity measure me by success
Fuck the accolades I want nothing but the bread

[Hook]
