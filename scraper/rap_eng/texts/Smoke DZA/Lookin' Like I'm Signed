[Hook – 360]
She said looking like I’m signed
Bitch I’m living like I’m [?]
They say I’m ahead of my time
Shit I ain’t even in my prime
They said I’m out of my mind
Big chains, big whips, big cribs, that fancy shit

[Verse 1 – 360]
Young nigga started from the dirt
Every verse put it in a hearse
The real recognizing what it is
I got to tell the truth, I know it hurts
Your hustle ain’t my hustle nigga
Shit ain’t working out the way you planned it
I heard you signed to 360
Ha, guess you really took my name for granted
This nigga just sold about 80 thou in his first week
We can both walk in the same club at the same time
And they’d notice me
They’re calling me a young OG
We both rocking, I’m rolling
I’m collecting all of my royalties
These motherfuckers can’t hold me
They mad
How a nigga this real who ain’t have to kiss ass
Done came up this fast?
They mad
Cause they got more cake but I hold more weight
Garner rich nigga hate
My bad
If I had to step on your toes
Sit back and let my ribs show, I suppose
Get the baking soda, turn the heat on the stove
Wasn’t stopping me then, had to eat off the Os
Now a nigga bout to murder it ([?])
Give praise to the most high (almighty)
Two words for the competition (so sorry)
I ain’t never gonna sell my soul (for nobody)
I done came this far by myself
I was born in this world, by myself
Imma die in this world, by myself
When I get to where I’m going, I don’t need your help
Nigga!

[Bridge]
Smoke, break, break, break
Smoke, break, break, break
Smoke, break, break, break
Smoke, break, break, break

[Verse 2 – Smoke DZA]
Kushed God bitch, riiiiight, (smoke!)
Came through stomping in my stelfs
You think you balling cause you got a Gucci belt?
Nigga you out here crying for help
(Let it sink in), bitch I’m signed to myself
Cosign, what cosign?
I certified my own shit
You out here tryna get bored
I’m out here tryna own shit
I make the bitches go crazy
I make the hippies go crazy
Do shows, smoke weed, and they pay me
Take a trip with my lady
Sucker free, that’s the way to be
Been real the whole time, no favors B
Independent nigga doing it majorly
Something lettered in between A and Z
Ain’t a time I ain’t touring
Overseas with it, I’m riding foreign
Pics pop up when you google Ralph Lauren
And it ain’t a weed song if DZA ain’t on it
Niggas don’t want it, not now, not ever
Lyrically I’m Mayweather
Dat nice, like May weather
Ay nigga, ay nigga
