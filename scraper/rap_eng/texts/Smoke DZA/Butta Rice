Kush god
K.O.N.Y
Riiiight

I ain't the one to fuck with
Criminal minded ain't no Boogie Down production nigga
Just destruction, no discussion
In New York the only other big nigga running shit is my brother from Flushing
Say somethin', I'm headhuntin'
Niggas act weird I get you niggas out of here
Soprano shit, call a hit
Sip a beer, by time I roll something you be in the trunk like a spare
911 niggas in the drama frequent
Think you Willie Dynamite let your momma feel it
Nigga prob(??) like the Lama speaks
Subliminals don't bother me, fuck y'all niggas honestly
Movie shit, go and get your Goobers
You respect the victim I respect the shooter
Separate the winners from the losers
Shit ain't been the same since 2Pac moved to Cuba

I'm the realest nigga here you all welcome
I'm the realest nigga here you all welcome
I'm the realest nigga here you all welcome
I'm the realest nigga here you all welcome
I'm on the grind all day all night nigga
Now throw the butter in the pot, let the rice simmer
I'm on the grind all day, all night nigga
Now throw the butter in the pot, let the rice simmer

No riff raff, my niggas bring the rice out
(Al dog) got the party drug for your nights
Near low, creeping with the hammer don't bring your ice out
First nigga make a slight move move, it's lights out
Going in for the kill like my niggas from the CHI
Gotta get it now, sink or swim, do or die
So coup d'etat, fuck around (for for??) the booby try
Take out your leader see how your crew react
Picture me rollin, high res(?)
I'm on you nigga's heads like Hugo Chavez
Smokey got the buddha, that Buddha I said
Scoota, Phil Rizzuto and low threats
You're now tuned into the Harlem slick talker
Soul and a hustle of an old New Yorker
Every big move, I got sayin' it
You bet your bed nigga, lay in it
