[Intro]
Right
Lucky Thompson in this muthafucka
Kush God
It's a Jet Life extravaganza, ya know?
Stay strong

[Verse 1]
Riiiiight
My fucking life is like a highlight reel
Step in these Rivermons, I show you how the high life feel
Don't ask me bout them niggas, shit I'm twice as ill
Talk that buzz shit for real, and I'm the nicest still
Ground hustler is your only [?]
Tryna get off on me? Shit is bound to get ugly
Probs, still got the .38 and its rusty
Trust me, get you little niggas touched, like Sandusky
Uhh, fuck the authorities, them C.B. four floors is just comedy
You met ya match my nigga, e-harmony
Player hater fuck ya mother, Jimmy Darmody
Don't get cute and see the outcome
Put you niggas in place, like New York City housing
Uhh, the Kush God has risen my son
So let it be written, so let it be done, right

[Hook]
This year all the gifts is getting wrapped
Fuck what you heard, I'm spending Christmas in the trap (trap, trap)
I'm spending Christmas in the trap (trap, trap)
I'm spending Christmas in the trap (Riiight)
Take the buds up out the pizzy
Smokin like a chimney, even Santa copped a 50
Right, I'm spending Christmas in the trap (trap, trap)
I'm spending Christmas in the (trap)

[Verse 2]
Riiight
Got the noiment popping, fuck the sound crew
And fuck a punchline, I'll physically pound you
Another peon tryna get down, but in this town, we the don't fuck around crew
Like Joey and Pauly coming through with them .40s
Want them chains, watches, anything looking sporty
My nigga Black need them racks, gotta gather this paper
Peter payed for Paul then its back to the table
Hustle hard, they call me the big flipper
On the hood I make 7 off a zipper
Harlem nigga so you know that I remain the dipper
Rugby to the ground any time that you see DZA, nigga
He's one dimensional, how you figure?
Everytime he drop a joint he just keep getting iller
Nigga buzz is getting bigger
Right, time to divvy up them figures, nigga

[Hook]
This year all the gifts is getting wrapped
