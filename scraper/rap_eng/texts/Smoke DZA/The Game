Right
Uh

[Chorus]
Uh, big bank take lil' bank, ball
Blue face Benny Franks
Gas is not the issue, keep something in the tank
As long as I stay high as this, trust me I could never sink, nah

[Verse 1]
I know you got the ticket can we link? Nah
Don't know these niggas from a can of paint, nah
Flying down the interstate
License plate from out of state
Moving weight out of shape
I get love I get hate I get paid I get laid I get blazed
I done prayed not a shame not afraid of a thing
Not a frame could refrain all the things that I seen
Smoking strains in the Bay, yadda'mean, yadda'mean
Bank roll, bank roll, figures, same clothes same pose nigga
They all got the same flows, lame goals same old mirror
How? How you be shit thats not my style
How?

[Chorus]
Uh, big bank take lil' bank, ball
Blue face Benny Franks
Gas is not the issue, keep something in the tank
As long as I stay high as this, trust me I could never sink, ball
Big bank take lil' bank, ball
Big bank take lil' bank, ball
Big bank take lil' bank, ball

[Verse 2]
What are you shitting me?
You really a vulture you not for the culture to tell me what shouldn't be
That didn't sit good with me, silence the jubilee
Do you believe, it's equal with you and me, truthfully
Keep it all way tall you just a regular civilian
This is for my hustlers, trappers, holla if you still here
Thought that I would fade away but nah because I'm still here
Standing on my own two separate pavilion, brilliant
Bugsey just touched down with like 200 Dickies
I told him pull up to the crib I'll move 150
Sent a kite up to my homie, drove down from Poughkeepsie
All cash give me the loot, nigga it's no Biggie, baby
Seven series I love the dough it's not my achillies
You got to feel me, the profit illy you not gon' kill me
Stop it really y'all too silly to want some drama really
Signing off, King of Gotham City

[Chorus]
Uh, big bank take lil' bank, ball
Blue face Benny Franks
Gas is not the issue, keep something in the tank
As long as I stay high as this, trust me I could never sink, ball
Big bank take lil' bank, ball
Big bank take lil' bank, ball
Big bank take lil' bank, ball
