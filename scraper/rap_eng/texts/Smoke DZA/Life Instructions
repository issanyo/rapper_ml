[Verse 1: Currensy]
Patty cake patty cake, I'm baked my man
Kick it on your street like bad chris and them garbage cans, aww man
Them bitches think I'm balling
So they behaving differently when I be in New Orleans
I'm falling back off em', they crawling back on em'
Not half way complaining just making a true statement
Which quite basically is what's missing from this game we in
Create the world in which you trying to live in kid
Some of my friends is passed away, some of my homies doing bids
But best believe I bring em' with me anywhere I is
What a hater say'll never affect the way that I live
Or where I go, just make me fuck they bitches in they crib
The game I got was raw and given to em' by Slim
Referring to himself in the third, when he on them herbs
Make sure I don't park out in the street
But don't get to close to the curb
Jet life too high for them birds

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Big doobies rolled up, you know how we do
Snow Beach Lo like Rae wore in '92
Rugbies all flavors, lime green Rod Lavers
Touring the world, getting paid off the talent God gave us
I'm parlaying, Marley's got me smack
Twistin' like a Rastafari Marcus Garvey on the track and I'm faded
Niggas hate it, now they all trying to get in
All the slick talk, I know you ain't really mean it
Sleeping on the kid, I hoped the bed was posturepedic
Begging for a verse, I'm like cock sucker beat it
What's your budget like? Go ahead and find a way
You trying to get in the loop, I make em' pay to ride the wave
Jet life, it sucks to be you
Trying to get swag you gotta purchase this cool
