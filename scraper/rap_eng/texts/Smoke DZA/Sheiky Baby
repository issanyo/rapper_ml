[Intro: Smoke DZA]
DZA
Sheiky baby what's good OG
Break his back make him humble
Pause
Right

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Sometimes you gotta put the hand of god to use
Kick the shit out a nigga with them pointy boots
If he try and take the tougher road
Make an example
So the others know
Begging for mercy but fuck him though
Make him humble since he can't adjust
Make that big mouth answer up
Pain
Talk shit, kick ass, and take names
Smokey baby ain't a damn thing changed

[Bridge:]
I'm from the hood, the jungle
Uh
Pause
Uh
I'm from the hood, the jungle
Break his back make him humble
Pause

[Outro: Iron Sheik]
This is Iron Sheik
I'm (?)
I love my brother, peace out
He (?)
Make you humble
