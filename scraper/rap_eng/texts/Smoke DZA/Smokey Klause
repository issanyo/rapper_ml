(Intro)
Riiiiight
Sweet Baby Kushed God
Gather round children
It's the night before Christmas

[Verse 1]
Fuck them reindeer, I come in that Continental V
Smokey Klause coming with that marijuana tree
Only bad yellow bitches get the candy cane from me
Jump up on my lap, baby tell me what you need
The night before Christmas I was all up in the house
Santa working overtime while I'm digging down the spouse
Not a creature staring so we did it on the couch
Thinking in my head like "This what it's about"
The children was nestled, snuggled up in their bed
Probably having X-Box visions up in their head
Her mama in her underwear and I'm in my skully
She making wild noise, I know it's bound to get ugly
Lil' nigga woke up cause he heard all the chatter
His mama was screaming, he trying to see what's the matter
Then to the closet, I flew in a flash
He opened the door, and he saw my stash
His mama had her titties out, trying to be low
Started asking her questions, told him that he had to go
Then through his wondering eyes, it would appear
Saw it was a rugby hanging off from the chair
The little fucker was quick, certainly clever
Started smiling and shit, like "It gotta be DZA"
Smelled the polo cologne, then he got brave
Knew all of my songs, started to call em by name
#KushedGod, 4 Loko, Sour Hour, ya kidding?
Personal Party, Continental Kush, He Has Risen
He spoke about that mirror that was on the wall
In Ralph's [?] shit, said he was fresher than all
Then threw a twinkle up, for I he would appear
Polo undershirt, Foamposites that's rare
Spoke not a word, not even a curse
Walked to the chair and he picked up his shirt
Sprang to the street, gave his a driver a whistle
Flew down the ave, I swear it looked like a missile
But I heard him scream, before he got out of sight
My fault lil nigga, Merry Christmas
Riiiiight
