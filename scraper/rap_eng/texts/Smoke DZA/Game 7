[Hook - ASAP Twelvy]
First of the month package straight
Kicks is new my rent is late
Fished is brewed need some shit today
I pray to God I'm a flip away

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Work is moving slow, bitches on my back
Cable about to get cut off and you busy talkin' bout rap
Waiting for the next tour to get a lump sum off that
But till then you niggas know where I'm at, real rap
I went O.T. with some bulbs, came back
Paid five months worth of bills like I got it off a show
Real life I got it off the blow, however you
Lookin' at it its the same shit though
Bank rolls, word to my marijuana
Mary Jane - that sneaky little bitch, Colombiana
Get a nigga rich comin' straight from the farmers
Put 'em with my men and sell 'em both to the corner
Like they on time out but watch for patrolers in time out
And don't be too thirsty to broadcast them dimes out
Go hard or get the fuck off the floor, (Twelvy) game seven shit nigga
Say no more

Twelvy:
First of the month package straight
Kicks is new my rent is late
Fished is brewed need some shit today
I pray to God I'm a flip away
I trap hard
Trap hard (Tra-tra-tra-trap hard) (X2)
DZA:
Go hard or get the fuck off the floor
(Game 7 shit nigga)
All voices:
Say no more

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvy]
Yo, I always been a hustle-a
Cool wit all my customer’s
Young nigga old soul
All the junkies fuck wit cha
Cooking up some shit to make my whole block bubble up
All the way trill like the real nigga Tumblr
Shout to Yamborghini, nigga stevie to the ev, to the asap
Niggas better greet me when they see me
With the two fingers, throw it up
Serving feinds fold the bucks
World gave me hell so I couldn’t give more fucks
Look at how i’m showing up and showing out
Purple smoke blowing out
Goon witta gold mouth
Trappin out a loan house
Barri get them hoes out, Relli get the moles out
We gone take the old route
This what harlem known bout
Get it with the x or the molly
Even worse go to work on the worst
Thats a body
Body after body is here
Approach the lobby with fear
Fuck the world i’m catching homi’s this year
