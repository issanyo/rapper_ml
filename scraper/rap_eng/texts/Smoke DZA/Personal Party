Flying down the west side
Joining my air
One bout to get lid up, I'm about to disappear
In thin air, feeling untouchable
Tommy bond, sincere, you think I give a fuck about a red light
Niggers can't do us, so they dead tight
Hating on a young slick nigga, for getting there
Fly shit I mastered it, nothing like your average
Cookie patch rugby bucket low like Smith
A nigga gotta eat, powerful million in my box
Just like Monopoly, I need propriety
I ain't trying to end up like them previous lames
Caught up, no bail money, in the game
Watch niggers life flush down the drain
The results of not playing they lane
For the money or fame
I said I'm in for the legacy, triple my change, nigga
Right, minus the ball, life is great
Super high, out of space, mind blowing got me on freeze
Plus everybody got they own trees, it's a personal party
Ah, light up at your own pace, cause this a personal party
Ah, I'm taking this one to the it's personal party
2 hoes for paper, write these rhymes on a steel plate
His words hold weight nigga, spit up
From el Salvador to the el rey
Jet life on the billboard never forget that day
Man, everything going just ask playing
My driver rolling up at the airport cause I'm
My girl left my hideout up
She hear that dough slam that pussy waking up
As I'm stepping up, she ripping off her clothes for
Now homie is it clear enough
I say get money, fuck bitches cause I get money
Them bitches want fuck
Is it clear homie, is it add enough
Right, minus the ball, life is great
Super high, out of space, mind blowing got me on freeze
Plus everybody got they own trees, it's a personal party
Ah, light up at your own pace, cause this a personal party
Ah, I'm taking this one to the it's personal party
Levitating on get well soon, kush god speed
Got these niggers sick, take a long z's
Matter of fact, this one's on me
For everybody that I lost this year
You know what lovers do, this one's for you
And the I got choices
Voice of the voice list I speak for the unheard
And got to say one word I got you
Be a fake nigga, not true
Nobody keep it real like I do
Everybody's praying its survival
Do or die, niggers don't abide rules
It's a cold world, ain't nothing else to do but pray
Little nigga got shot in the mouth broad day yesterday
Life what is worth to you?
Question deep enough for me to light a personal
