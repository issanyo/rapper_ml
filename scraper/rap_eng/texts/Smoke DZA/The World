[Verse 1]
The kid cannon the competition and then some
What you niggas bragging about, I been done
Can't see me Davie Patterson
Had a little head start I'm about to lap em up again
I'm track trafficking
Hopping in and out of cities like a jumper
Sour diesel influence that I'm under
Fun but, dumb stuck
Nigga be, higher than a falcon in the sky
Loaded off the cherry pizzai, nigga...
Getting money
I ain't gotta fuck with the check scam
Mean green Rondo I play with the headband
Kid move weight like, Ian Smith
Nigga ain't, seeing chips so he ain't shit
Don't speak about him, talking all that hardcore crap
All that big business shit, then where your bar-code at?

[Interlude]
It ain't for you it's for the world

[Verse 2]
Wifey want me to be regular, I'm trying to get it like Bono
Hit South Beach and lounge at the Delano
Central park apartment at Donalds
Totally large, future is ODD like Tyler and Domo
Fuckin user, substance abuser, abuse the Buddha
Chronic chronic smoker no basuda
Gotta get the facts clear
Checking all you pussies like a pap smear
Playing me the, chances are slim like a Mac Air
I rap yeah - Getting fetti on your block
In your building, little nigga, he got packs there
Don't get lax there - You niggas outta luck
It's new management in the building and the rent is going up
All these obstacles I hurl until I get what's rightfully mines
The world
