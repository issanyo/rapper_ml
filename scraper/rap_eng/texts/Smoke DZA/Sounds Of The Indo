[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
I used to go naughty flow up to skate key
Bad bitch, niggas on her block used to hate me
Try to back me down, thank God for the safety
For them at least, cus' shit niggas die every day B
You doubted me, be proud of me, thought it was over for me
Fake rain on my parade, it's looking oh so sunny
Hustla', used to be the little brother understudy, over it
Hit the strip now I'm gettin' all this money
Used to top ramen it, till I got winnin'
P's go for 65 in Providence
Got a bunch of white boys tryna' spend some dollars and
Imma' go get it like that shit is going out of trend
What's poppingtin? Them niggas jocking him
Tryna' sneak in with us but we not with them
(Kill these niggas, Dza!) I got em', Den!
Fuck them niggas hollerin', game 7 shit, nigga, I gotta' win

[Hook: Den10]
The percolating sounds of the indo
I'm higher than the highest of heavens, soar
I'm trying to throw Pirellis on a Porsche
I'm riding with the top back, rain pourin'
Smoother than a Ski Beat sliding on em'
No homo, no not your order nor
No y'all niggas better run and go
Get a job with the fuckin' flows y'all spittin', uh!

[Verse 3: Smoke Dza]
I used to go Pebble Beach for the freakin'
Now I go Montreal suites for the weekend
Blue dreamin' out in Cali, I don't see them
Steamin', got me havin' trouble breathing right
It's the High Times spitta' of the year
Put a lot of niggas on, niggas used to wear my gear
Yeah but since I hit the net, shit it's something like, Cheers
Everybody know my name, yeah know I'm up in here
No horseplay, only my wears
Hard denim Levi's, Beamer thats the G Ride
Might slide ya chica, she use my mic to bebop
She get her Dougie on, then put her girlfriend on
Might slide the whole crew, that's the shit that I be on
Smoke a doobie wit her, do it wit her, then I'm gone
Shit, I'm a monster, slayin' these bitches
I'm on my 'Bron shit, conquer
Baddest motherfucker on the conference

[Hook: Den10]
The percolating sounds of the indo
I'm higher than the highest of heavens, soar
I'm trying to throw Pirellis on a Porsche
I'm riding with the top back, rain pourin'
Smoother than a Ski Beat sliding on em'
No homo, no not your order nor
No y'all niggas better run and go
Get a job with the fuckin' flows y'all spittin', uh!

[Outro: George Bush]
There's an old saying in Tennessee--I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee--that says, "Fool me once, shame on... Shame on you... Fool me, can't get fooled again!"
