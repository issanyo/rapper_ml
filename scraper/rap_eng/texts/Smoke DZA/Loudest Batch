[Hook: Den10]
Clouds is back, wow in fact
Said we gon' rain on your shower cap
Come here little mama let your brows go flat
Girlfriend heard it's the Sour Patch
Loudest pack, loud is packed
Super duper loud what's louder than that
Air 95's with the sour to match
Screamin' out the joint it's the loudest batch

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
I can't do mines outlandish I'm
Big dog cause I'm circling this land of mine
Lyical and divine
Rap sour [?]
Niggas try to stop me how?
Road blocks I knock em down
Knock it off I got this boss easy
Full throttle DZA never been the brake type
Just roll an 8th like, like

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Roll up, butcher the beat like I'm Dolis
About to get bloody in this muhfucka real quick
It's the murderous 9/11 verbalist
About to get medieval on these little niggas feel this
Used to get played now I get payed
Watchin' tables turn on niggas like everyday
Niggas couldn't walk in my pearls you niggas is
Trynna be king of New York trynna be King of the World
Fuck the naysayers or hayprayers wishing I fail
That there be heaven for them instead I give them all hell
TOS the competition all well
Kushed God is in the muhfucka all hail

[Hook]
