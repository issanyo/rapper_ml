[Intro]
Really... kush god, bitch

[Verse1]
Keep dour in a mason jar
Ya’ll with the throwback losing shaw
Be the boss don’t be the help
Hustle until you no longer got to introduce yourself
They like 'hey, aren't you..?',  yeah
Niggas is the same stance the sign of new years
Hmm I’m like tonic with mind you like who
You just the local catch you niggas just rhyme
Right been popping since the skate kid
You aw to got dazed crossed the bridge for your AV
Ah vision all hazy it's the flow that make them
Stoners go crazy hey you want to get high
I have a joint here as you can see
Is it heavy stuff man going to blow me away
That’s the stuff man I’m over the moon

[Verse2]
Right customs fit tuskin sits I got the loud on tuck
With them custom swifts the throne got to rush to shit
Muscled and tip got it all covered like a Muslim chick
90 on me don’t ask the splits
And anyway I match you can trust it’s lit
Get paid off my melodies crib all amenities
First class flights out of John F Kennedy
Bar to be Tony the one and only
Feleish chow genus for winners no ricoronies
Expensive watch choppers
Cartoon short toppers to the haters to the heart doctors
I walked the the walk talked the talk
I pop up I gots to get my burn on
Niggas can’t knock us George Kush back in the seat
No more postas misthalin whatever you on no one going to
Stop us

[Outro]
I am going to smoke this joint man not going to be a
Problem at all man Yow talk it out man
Shit I have been smoking since I was Born man
