[Chorus]
Smoking the smoke
Abusing the substance
Shit I'm so high
What the fuck I see the moon man
Marijuana eyes
Brownies in the oven
Mouth all dry
'Bout to roll up another dem
Zips of the sour
Dump it in the dutch
Purple showers granddaddy  punch
Magic dragon, cause all I do is puff
La la la la la la la la

Yeah I smoke sour
Some call it dour
Back to back blunts I’ll be back in a few hours
All I do is chief chief
Pass, till I’m fried
Plus the muhfuckin bud brownies, nigga I’m high
Got my young chick high she like O M G
Before the bag open smell the potency
Half a blunt in and she so friendly
Laid her on her back ever so gently
We don’t smoke dirt, we style on jabronis
Chain smoke blunts like dice play the brokies
What up? It’s the one and only
Barack Oskama come smoke with the homies

[Chorus]
Smoking the smoke
Abusing the substance
Shit I'm so high
What the fuck I see the moon man
Marijuana eyes
Brownies in the oven
Mouth all dry
'Bout to roll up another dem
Zips of the sour
Dump it in the dutch
Purple showers granddaddy  punch
Magic dragon, cause all I do is puff
La la la la la la la la

Light it , don’t fight it
Gotta break down, roll it up, fire that bitch
Damn boo damn you bong hits
You don’t get as high as I get
Day and night like the Cudi kid
More I puff the smaller the dutchie gets
Hieroglyph light more piff
Purple that purple this purple cannabis
Purple got me in the game that's the tone of my lips
Got me flying back to Cali, copped the valley from them, uh
I had to hustle, kept smoking my flip
I’m chong he’s cheech and you know what it is

[Chorus]
Smoking the smoke
Abusing the substance
Shit I'm so high
What the fuck I see the moon man
Marijuana eyes
Brownies in the oven
Mouth all dry
'Bout to roll up another dem
Zips of the sour
Dump it in the dutch
Purple showers granddaddy  punch
Magic dragon, cause all I do is puff
La la la la la la la la

Nah buddy I don’t fuck with the hookah
No E, no xannies, strictly the buddah
And I admit I do have a problem
Have an attitude if I go a day without it
That's why the scenery is cloudy
Sprayin a can of ozium, I'm gettin nothin out it
I hold the blunt, I be steaming high
Meaning I don’t pass off till I'm demon eyed
You see the text my guy
Now pass the dutchie 'pon the left hand side
I roll Louisville Sluggers, nigga batter up
Spark it up leave a nigga stuck

[Chorus]
Smoking the smoke
Abusing the substance
Shit I'm so high
What the fuck I see the moon man
Marijuana eyes
Brownies in the oven
Mouth all dry
'Bout to roll up another dem
Zips of the sour
Dump it in the dutch
Purple showers granddaddy  punch
Magic dragon, cause all I do is puff
La la la la la la la la
