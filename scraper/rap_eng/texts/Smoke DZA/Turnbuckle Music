[Intro] - [Rasta]
Wicked, wicked production you know how it go man
Ya'll listen to music by Harry Fraud man
0'12 man. New 'tings
Bronson man
Big boss Bronson man and little brother DZA

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yo, once again it's the quintessential stud muffin
Spanish bitches stub sucking' they wanna have my kid
My people know how to bid, I focus on how to live though
Come through the window snatch your kiddo while he watchin' Nintendo
The people love us though they snub us in the corporate world
Fuck it we lawless ridin' filthy in the taurus with Doris, she 85
My neighbor, thrilled by wild behavior they get a bloomers when I'm in Aruba with a scuba jet

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Yes, kush god daddy I'm on that other flow
That motherfuck that cover tho that hustle move a motherload
That, big boy talk say raps you tryna book a show, gold bottle
Hold the rows kush rolled that's holy smoke
It's turnbuckle music, straight off the third row
Straight on you herbs throats, that's why you birds broke
Tweet tweetin' with your tweetin' ass, we rather count cash and cheef some hash
We bout that

[Hook (DZA & Bronson)]
(you pick him up), I drop em/ (he trynna creep), I watch him/ (you need me tag me in), nah don't worry I got it/ should never fuck around with people thats a stable/ cut into your navel, put em through the table.

[Verse 3: DZA]
Underdog underrated undoubtedly don't give a fuck
Rap money twice a week prices going up as we speak
I ain't trippin' niggas sleep and tell them little rap niggas trying to catch a wave a couple bands and send a beat
Digital hustler putting ass in seats
I know my worth and I ain't fucking with the cheap
Two of the realest most of these rap niggas weak
Cut a couple bars
Let Bam Bam speak

[Verse 4: Action Bronson]
Buh buh buh bow!
Brushing paris holland Italy Pristina
Kosovo, Denmark, hopping out the Benz sharp
I teach you how to live
Michael Caine dirty rotten scoundrels
My bitches blow me at the opera while I'm rocking sandals
Light linen, rest on my physique
I'm testin', built for the west
And you get molested while you sleep
Back to the essence cause your testicles are weak
Got some Mexicans to put the fucking hash between there cheeks

[Hook]
