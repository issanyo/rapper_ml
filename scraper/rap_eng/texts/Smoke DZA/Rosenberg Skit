[Skit: Peter Rosenberg]
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Ringside thr- five
Damn it's already five
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Ringside Five with Smoke DZA
And I'm your host; Peter Rosenberg
I'm literally at WrestleMania right now
A tradition unlike any other
That was until Ringside started
And here we are yet again; my man DZA, alright
The greatest day of the year; Ringside Five
And I'm your host; Peter Rosenberg
And this is Ringside Five
Smoke DZA, let 'em know what time it is
This is for the Hip Hop heads, this is for the wrestling heads
This is for the, this is for the, the smarkiest of the smarky
You know what I mean?
This is for the, the people who, who on that network 24/7
You know what I'm saying?
Digging up YouTube all day, every day
You know what tie it is; Ringside Five
Smoke DZA, Rosenberg
