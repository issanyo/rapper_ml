[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Everyday I wake up I say a pray-uh
Thank the Lord for the fact that nigga hey-uh
Round of a applause, got a lot of work to spay-uh
Transactions bring that paper upstairs
Gotta make sure all that money there
I don't play when come to them onions
Take them ones to the bank, I need hunnids
No fives and tens, I don't want it
I ain't trying to be a bastard
But coming with straight Benjis made the counting process faster
I'm a trapper, weed dealer
My everyday watch is a Sea Dweller
I see cheddar
Going for the gusto with no regrets on what I coulda been
I put it in, ringleader of the shadow government
My last rap check I bought pounds of good
This next one's to get my moms out the hood
She working to pay the bills and I'm working to have a chill
Til then I'm playing the field tryna get this chicken for real

[Hook x2: Smoke DZA]
Shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak, we all tryna win
But then again
Ambition turn to anger
And there you have it, best friends turn to strangers, uh
Right

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
I let it go and let my chips stack
My nigga got caught for some work but we ate better of the git back
It might as well have been gift wrapped
The number one rule don't leave no work where your kids at
Cause it's the hustle gang these streets ain't right
Stash in another crib and keep my heat up high
Road to the riches to the top of the mountain
Say "goodbye" to being poor, say "hello" to accountants
Cop my bitch a big Birkin and some kush and Loboutins
Shout out to that scale that helped me weigh out them ounces
Watch out for the leeches and ? waveriders and hoes
That come over sober with alterior motives
Weed out the fake friends
Shit be all good when they in
That's your man tell him no for something see then
Shouts to the cats that expect nothing from me
Different number same jersey

[Hook]

[Verse 3: NymLo]
We used to fight for building blocks
Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing
So we could cop coupes remove roof poof ceiling
Fresh off the stoop ten inch boots, God willing
A nigga see tomorrow, dodging tips that's hollow
Yea I drink a lot but never pride swallowed
Gripping on my bottle from the home of Apollo
You could wear the wire while I move like Marlo, harpo
Was what a nigga pushing for as I cook the raw
Shit you could tell nigga just look at me then look at y'all
Key and ivory weigh ins I'm low down, dirty ?
Pay attention and you'll get just what I'm saying
Coming of age as I'm stuck in my ways
Where I'm from to get your name rung you gotta keep your hand gun
Can I live nigga? Is you friend or foe
I live by these three words--money cash hoes, it's Lo
