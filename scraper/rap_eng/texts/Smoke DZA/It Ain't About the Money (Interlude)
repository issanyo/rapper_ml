[Verse:]
Smoke man it’s your turn man
It’s that time to get busy man
Ain’t no going back
Everybody [?] some good time
It’s time to get that money
You know it ain’t just about the money B
It’s about achieving greatness
It’s about the legacy, know what i mean
It’s about walking through this mothafucka and making everybody cater to you
You know, own this shit
I mean from there, that’s how you make everything valid
And it’s about fucking these bitches
Thirsty nigga
