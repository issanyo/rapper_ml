[Chorus: Vado]
What you know about grinding til the sun up?
Tryna get your one's up
Gotta stay down til you come up
'Fore you start looking like a come up
Let a nigga run up
Guns start swinging like a nunchuck

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
You know I'm off the dutchess
Pounds in the cupboard
Only God can judge us
You know I got it covered
Sipping on brown water
Five pound order
Got me ready to run out stu'
My other man said he coming for two
It's a good day
Making moves, just like I earn this shit (True)
Busting chomps on the Google line
What's a true hustler?
You define
Nigga copping work off his two-to-nine
Thirty-two for one
Thirty-five, maybe
I'm like what drought?
Niggas searching crazy
Don't cop from strangers, need collateral
Fucking around off desperation, niggas'll hit you with some rabbit food
Classic low piece, got it from Durst
[?] hat, double R denims going to work
You on Instagram, think you important, fucking bum
You sweat the bitch, I curve the bitch, she annoying

[Chorus: Vado]
What you know about grinding til the sun up?
Tryna get your one's up
Gotta stay down til you come up
'Fore you start looking like a come up
Let a nigga run up
Guns start swinging like a nunchuck

[Verse 2: Vado]
I'm the last Dragon
Shells fly when gats blasting
Hoping they'll go over your head, like cast captions
Opening up right here, we past asking
Player, every game I played, I had baskets
Like Forty, sweatsuit, like Nordy
With a bad bitch, think rap is type corny
When I'm in the streets, Police be type for me
Said I stayed mixed in beef, like rice roni
I don't jock that
What I wear, you cop that
Talk swagger, I got that
Sound packer, you blocked that
Where the block at, dope fiends and rock at?
Where I used to rock a SP and my Roc hat
Like I'm fresh up off the short bus
Tryna beef [?]
For the long run, not a shortcut
Making sure we for sure'd up
[?]
