(Smoke DZA)

Riiiiighhhtttt!!!
The voice of the voiceless, hopeless
Money never made me being broke did, know this
Kill these mothafuckas no notice
No really, the haters no biggie, I was high when it hit me
Niggas rather see me filthy, not filthy rich, shit, homie health is wealth
I'm at the juice bar taking bar shots, thinking what I'm about to scoop up from the car lot
See you at the bank? Or not. I told Steve after this the price going up!
Shit, cause I'm Really Fuckin' Cool, Really Fly and Comfortable
Really Fuck Your Crew, Really Flippin' Caine, Really Stunt on You (Oh Shit!)
