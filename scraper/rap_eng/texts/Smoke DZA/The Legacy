[Intro]
Not For Sale, Not For Sale, Not For Sale
Post no bills unless they're blue face hundreds

[Verse 1]
My skully game mean, I drop two and a quarter
Alexander Wang I copped for me and my daughter
She told me for her birthday she wanna go to Bora Bora
Hold up, some place she never seen on Dora the Explorer
That's my baby, she match my aura, make it happen for her
Any means, triple beams schemes for my little queen
I'm talking presence not presents, this is not for sale
I see that hate that you wearing nigga, it fits you well
Couple tickets at the short stay, I never kiss and tell
Had to wing shorty, he bring the pack back fast and plus he listen well
Know a nigga up top better than Bron but couldn't make the bail
I'm talking hate for real, [?] case appeal
Keep a hundred, that's my favorite bill
I'm too wavy to ever take a pill
This high is not for sale

[Outro]
This high is not for sale
(This high is not for sale)
The culture, the cool, this is not for sale
The love, the smooth, this is not for sale
Not for sale, this high is not for sale
(This high is not for sale)
The culture, the cool, this is not for sale
The love, the smooth, this is not for sale
Not for sale
