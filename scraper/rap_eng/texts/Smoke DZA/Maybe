[Intro:]
Real life shit
Shawncey and LV
Easy on that LV though

[Chorus:]
Maybe we gotta leave it all to fate
Maybe we gotta go separate ways
Maybe we gotta slow it down at times
Cause we moving too fast to see the signs
Too fast to see the signs
Cause baby you feel the same way you do
Maybe I’m buggin' out offa you
Cause maybe you’re just too good to be true [x2]

[Verse 1:]
Maybe so, maybe not
Maybe I am the nigga for you, maybe I’m not
Maybe we rush things being too hot
Maybe we just chill and let god figure it out
And the same after we fall just gettin little more
Say she hate this rap shit
But it’s what we livin' offa
Maybe she hate it cause she always number two
And every time she need me there’s somethin' I gotta do
Decisions made in the livin' and I’m always away
But the fist come every month
And them bills get paid
No money can make up time
Cause  I’m gon' make up every minute I missed I promise
Every time we beefin'
Remember when I love you like cooked food from Evelyn’s
Chopped wings from the Chino’s
After the arguments start gettin' E-mo
Kissy face E-mos
You know how we roll

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Maybe so, maybe not
Maybe I am the nigga for you, maybe I’m not
Maybe we rush things being too hot
Maybe we just chill and let god figure it out
Cause when in doubt a different route
I be zippin' out
Before you get the sentence out, know you got the slickest mouth
That aggression gotta dick her down then sit her down
Let’s kick it now, boggle a nigga to get it out
She say "I’m vain" and then she pout
Maybe the lack of attention is what it’s bout
I’m in the lab like the graveyard shift
She on the love and war shit singing Tamar shit
She a rider not a brain washed chick, she get it
Situation gotta stash that grip, she wit' it
Scream my name when I fuck her and she arched
Tatted on her back and tatted on her heart
Let's never be apart

[Chorus]
