(Hook - The Doctor)
Know this, out here on a limb ya
Thinking bout the time and the money well spent
Notice now I'm in my own place
Love ya if ya love me, you can doubt like once said
Notice, nothing seeming different
Seeing all around me know it could all end minutes
I notice things are looking suspect
All of us so obsessed with what we think is success

(Verse 1 - Josh Sallee)
Its like...black sky, smoke clouds
Star lit, but no company
Slow down timing out
Back to the earth so comfortably yeah
Lost in my own head
Thoughts of myself in my past iont know him
Got to control it
Probably was tripping don't need no condolence
Gting it all ready
Now bout to make it all happen composing
Tuning em out
Everyone thinking they know how its going
Silent but working
Going all elway don't need any warning
Why dont they got it yet
Probably sleeping like four in morning
Ignore what they say i
Forward calls as the day goes
More she call well the less I'm on
So I'm more in awe if you say no
Stop with the talk that can not be enough
Gotta flock to spot where they can't go
Boxed in box where the popular pops
But it ain't what i want cause its fake gold I
Take the show like wheels & willis, uh I'm still the illest
Still come through and i spill that realness, spazz, sweatin why the females filming
And my homies on lock don't need more then them
Cause the work coming in and we ain't short of hand
Ow one yeah a bunch money, no one day its coming from me

(Verse 2 - Smoke DZA)
Hol' up, you can't fuck with the ruler
Barack oscama the marijuana abuser
Rick steam boat I ain't passing in the buddah
Dowja got me outta this world I can't maneuver
Passing dirt is an insult
And since when you cowardly lions talk tough to Kimbo
Bird ass niggas get plucked real simple
Easy as duck hunt on the old Nintendo
Lame you a snitch ass, swtch as bizza
Don't get gassed cause we kick ass, ya bitch ass
You's a grown ass man and you still getting gilled
Lil' nigga tryna eat and can't afford the bill
Trying to play me better off playing the mega-mil
I do this shit for real, you still trying to catch a deal ugh
Clear the run way baby
Since I stop smoking doobies the blunts taste crazy
