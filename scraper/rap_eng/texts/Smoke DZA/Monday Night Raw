[Verse 1: Left Brain]
Bam Bam Bam Bam Bigelow
Got me feeling like Deuce Bigalow
Yeah got me feeling like R. Kelly, I'm a male gigolo
WWF nigga
I'm jumping off the top rope
Gotta go to the hood spot nigga
No cop, no thoughts though nigga
I don't need rules
I don't need regulations
Riding through the motherfucking hood with my motherfucking mind gone delegation
Ten bulletproof Escalades when I pull up to your city with my campaign
Walk into your local titty bar and pop a hundred fifty bottles full of champagne

[Hook: Left Brain]
Monday night Raw
It's that Monday night Raw
Monday night Raw
Monday night Raw
Monday night Raw
Monday night Raw
Monday night Raw
Monday night Raw
It's that Monday night Raw
Monday night Raw

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Big gram, Vader
If you ain't with the gang you a hater
Gas mask, faded
Take a pull of this, see you later
Tree up, feet up, see us, we up
They sus, they Jake the Snake
They not to be trusted
Avoid the fuck shit, delete
Broken brilliance, believe
Fuck is you talking bout
Tombstones, coffins out
They don't want a war, they wanna talk shit out
Huh, how you figure boy
Pick up, boy, on them you don't walk this out
Monday night Raw
Bring your own bud that's a Monday night law
Won't Figure 4 buzz ain't no touching my jaw
Step in my square and I'm crushing your jaw

[Hook: Left Brain]
Monday night Raw
It's that Monday night Raw
Monday night Raw
Monday night Raw
Monday night Raw
Monday night Raw
Monday night Raw
Monday night Raw
It's that Monday night Raw
Monday night Raw
