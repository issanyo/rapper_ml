[Intro]
La Música de Harry Fraud

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Rubber bands wrapped, all my knots
My bitch pulled with a teacup yorkie in a Range Rover droptop
Now I’m riding shotgun underneath the sun
Thumbing through these $100 bills like 1’s
Father fly, got so many rap sons
High grade medicinal in my lungs when I swung on blades
Severed heads bled in a pathway we fled
All my friends are dead presidents so stack bread
Clearly, homie, you been misled
Foolish of you to listen to what a hater had said
Life is a SuperBowl bet, million dollar point spread
Covered like comforters on the bed
Money tree leaves hanging like dreads
Company currently on the run getting paid
Company comfortably wearing diamonds on stage
Making movies, killing beats, putting ‘em on the front page
Yeah

[Bridge: Sample & Smoke DZA]
[?] a lot of stuff on the boat, looks like he might be dumping some more stuff here, how many objects are there about five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen
Really
[?]

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Right, presidential crowns, presidential suites
Door to door with the pack like I'm Uber Eats
Like move ten of em maybe you can sleep
I left the plug house at 12 he gave me two for free
Drug money in our pockets
The best part of it it's all profit
The Never Die Corporation
All these hundred together look at the organization
Ice cold is my aura
Put designer on my sons and my daughters
Bullshit to the side, old dodger like Tommy Lasorda
You talkin' stoner lifestyle you tuned in to the fathers
Hm, I'm like why even bother these niggas liars?
They makeup game on Sephora
Pass me a lighter
Smoke one for the illest squads
Traditional mob
This lil' thing of ours

[Outro: Sample]
[?] looks like two people went into the water[?] I wanna know whos left on that boat [?] before someone else gets them
