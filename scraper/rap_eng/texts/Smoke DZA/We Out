[Prod. Cardo]

[Refrain]
Cause we out
Right

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
It's like I pulled out my 'Lo duffle
Christian Dior with the gold buckles
Attitude seen so subtle
But when she walked through you know it's trouble
Nothing can hide that bubble, niggas get emphatic
Conversation, stop, turn around, automatic
She caught high contact, and then we caught eye contact
I winked at her and she smiled on back
I play along with her, let them other niggas
Get to chumming up, she [?] up
Cause I ain't swarming her, trying to make her unwind
Fine ass through her pussy in the air make the sun shine
You're messing with a nigga in charge
Fascinated cause I treat her like a regular broad
Already know the play and she down for the cause
Come and go as she please, shit these bitches ain't ours

[Bridge: Smoke DZA]
She's shows up, I ain't ask for it
Got one life to live make it last girl
Got a boyfriend? Don't get your ass caught
We'll be right back hope you got your passport

[Hook: Smoke DZA]
Cause we out
One trip make your whole life change
Cause we out
Four five six at the dice game

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
No need for the ducking and weaving
Pack light we'll back in the evening
Shit I'm feeling like switching to Seasons
Plus my boats won't give me rights when I see them
Ugh, we somewhere on the clouds
In the mean time you know I brung my own loud
I know you don't smoke on special occasions, mean we step it up
Though I roll big joints on the regular
Hit the spot all types drinks is getting bought up
Madhushala bottle with Rozay bigger than my daughter
Woah, hater's sight so
Never seen like bottles like those
That's how we do it baby
Living in the fast lane fly, young, black, and crazy
Passing up would be stupid to do
So roll with a G and do what it do
