[Hook]
Uh, local superstars
Once was, but ain't get too far
Uh, wasn't humble enough to get in
Now you on the pine, playground legend
Uh, another playground legend
Uh, ain't get too far, playground legend

[Verse 1]
Even though he was a dumb nigga
He was pretty advanced for a young nigga
His older brothers, they was in the streets
Feedin' him stories, he used to run with 'em
Little snot-nosed kid thinkin' he too hard
But he got props for killin' rappers in the schoolyard
Lil big mouth nigga
That could rap his ass off, never thought he'd be a loser
Rap-wise he was corner heavy
Started runnin' around like he on already
Ghetto to ghetto he had a little fame
Feelin' himself, turnin' to Eddie Kane

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Might've been the nicest nigga to handle the rock
Cross over to the block, hand to handin' the rock
Straight awol from his hoop team
One day he just woke up from his hoop dreams
He used to mac with the hunnies
Play ball in other blocks, kill cats for the money
Til one day he watched Bronce tail in and try to turn into Sunny
Went on some bullshit in the corner niggas looked at him funny
Caused some static with some local dealers
Started carryin' ratchet knowin' you not a killer
Could've went to the A got him a max deal
Now he ridin' aside, got him a max bid

[Hook]

Uh, another playground legend
Uh, ain't get too far, playground legend
