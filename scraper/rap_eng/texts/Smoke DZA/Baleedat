All aboard!
"La musica de Harry Fraud"
Riiiight!

[Verse 1: Smoke Dza]
Cold as North Dakota, kush is that aroma
Brand new piece from Ralphie's, courtesy of Fola
Always gotta flow of bad bitches on my cobra
In love with the vagina, but not with the beholder
Faded off the Gin until we meet again
Cause just like sanitation
I be out like 3 AM
She always wanna chill cause her man is in the pen
I'm with my nigga Richie, make sure you bring a friend
We like em light-skinned, type: slim, long hair
And freak joints, enticing
We don't wife em, no time to enlighten
We just pipe em, slide like M. Bison

[Hook]
I say it's like that! I'm just leasing the girl
You can have your wife back
She's G'd up, she don't like rap
She just want a real nigga that will pipe that
Baleedat! Baleedat! Baleedat!
She hit a nigga daily cause I'm filling that void
She say she need that, baleedat! baleedat!

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Fast life, slow flow, same old shittin new clothes
We tryna put them papers on your bitch
Say it ain't so, Fool, who you come up with?
Couldn't have been the OG's who raised me
Slidin' through the city checkin' my traps that gold D
Cadillac Mac Alonte, droptop fishbowlin' them haters
See what I got, your bitch in the passenger
Passin' the anthrax, wrappin' the Raw
Over to the Jet Life, a collector of them classic cars
Smoke thicker than peanut butter, me and this bitch
Don't even see each other, when we be together
But she feel me and I feel her ass, softer than a motherfucker
She cook good and get way high, I understand why you love her
