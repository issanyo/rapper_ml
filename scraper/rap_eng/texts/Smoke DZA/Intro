Mmhmm
Its a vibe
Its a painting
Its a moment
This mother fucker in your capsule
This something that only come around once in a lifetime
Mmhmm
We come from money-making Harlem
The Wild 100's
Like old Harlem
I watched the gentrification
Before it was into Starbucks and Chase banks and all that fly shit
All the cool little trendy restraunts
Talking 'bout every corner was flooded
Nice day if you hear the mother fucking dirt bikes roaring
My battle ain't with you nigga, my battle ain't with you
My battle was with the time
My battle was with the sound
Internationally known, world reknown
Stoneless emcees
Last of a dying breed
