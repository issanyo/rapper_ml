[Hook: Curren$y]
Riding on mirrors
Help them sucka ass niggas see it clearer
See yourself, watch us get richer
Me and my nigga DZA, riding on mirrors
[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Hundred foot yacht
Smoking out the state room, make room for a nigga
Bigger than the block, feds taking pictures
Inquisitive, interested in how I make my living
From this balling and chilling, pencil and pen pimping
Two of my bottom bitches, write the rhymes
Write my name on the checks that I sign
It's roll up time, windex the windows in my mind
And let the ones who understand see what's going on inside
Only share with those, worth they weight in gold
Gotta be in the know to really know though
You know my bitch eyes slanted, Yoko
Lennon Andretti, highed up, peace signs in my photos
Headrest bearing the family crest
Baby girl, you clearly rocking with the best
Eulogize when I arrive for I'm fresh to death

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Jet Lifing on these bitches like I'm 'posed ta
Rugby bandana wrap my head up like the Hulkster
And I ain't banging though, unless I'm banging hoes
Bitches suck and swallow like they tryna find the antidote
Niggas be fronting, acting mad for real
'Til you slide they main squeeze, have them mad for real
Weak bladders, I be pissing them off
Cause payback is more of a bitch when your bitch is involved
Classic 'Lo on my '97 Pennys, this my vintage fit
Think Christmas, got big tree lit up, no Rockefeller Center shit
This fucking hash tasting sweeter than some cinnasticks
Have you fidgeting then put you out real sinister
More onions, I need more hundreds
Posers don't want it, they Malibu's Most Wanted
We all know you ain't really that guy
You don't even be inhaling, you be faking the high
Riiiiiight

[Hook]
