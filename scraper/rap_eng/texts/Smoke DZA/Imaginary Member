[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Righttttt
Catch him being a groupie at the shows
Tryna creep backstage but he stopped at the door
Come in with that bullshit weed
Tryna light niggas up but we good on that though
You lyin' ass nigga, that ain't OG
Askin' all types of questions like you police
Tryna get the numbers on that joint
Dial 1-800-CURVE, my nigga, that's toll-free
Only the bitches get to kick it
Why you tryna chill with a bunch of niggas?
O I get it, you just wanna be down
O you a fan of the music, nigga? Stand in the crowd
I ain't trippin' on fans, shit we could all chatter
But in my hotel lobby, that's stalker status
You just look like a clown. But that won't get you down, just get you pounded

[Hook]
You just tryna get down but you ain't really that cool
You tryna get down, you tryna get down with the crew
No matter how hard you try, it just ain't you
You tryna get down, clown
