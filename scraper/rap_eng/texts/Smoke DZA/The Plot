[Intro]
My day just started
God hours
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse]
Come home with me
Early 2000, 3rd period bouncing
I was running through housing low
Trying to stay away from crowds with yosh
But that's another story hundred million miles ago
Paper on the streets wasn't funny money yet
Youngins by the check, cashing plotting for them summer yummy checks
Pebble beat, set up the net right by the doorway
Was too young for the short stay then
Fast forward to dice game shootings adrenaline buzz
Lil' homie took 60 and he grinned at the judge
The streets came and turned father
Young black targets
Kingpin conspiracy charges
Card swippers and con artists
Feds got the block looking like a scene from Law & Order
Just got some news I was dreading
My man got snatched he a felon
Nothing to do with it wait, somebody's telling
Bitch you guessed it no blindfold
I've seen this play before with my eyes closed
Either he buried in the system or he crept through a pothole
Cause in the streets for shawty its too much churassaco
Another Harry from Goodfellas
He put his man down too he was real jealous
It all started one jittery night
He sold dimes, son sold weed and fucked bitches he liked
Deal gon' bad you could see it was tight
Now he 'bout to jam something got the scenery right
Son had no clue oblivious to it, staying local
Now its domino effect, daughter that son never met
Baby talking reckless on the internet
The only he benefit is son salty like vinaigrette
That's a well known fact, dead on trap
Got son stuck like nail on wax
Fell on back, took a L on that
Master Splinter he a well known rat
Words spread ain't nothing to say to him
Sent a kite got him left in the day room
