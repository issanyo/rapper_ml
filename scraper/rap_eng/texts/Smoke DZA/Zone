[Prod. by 6th Sense]

[Intro: Smoke DZA]
Yeah, yeah, DZA
6th Sense production
Cause for destruction
Yeah
Kush God bitch

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Riiiiiiight
Flow, insane deranged nigga
I'm hungry like a wolf, Duran Duran
I get to swanging on you niggas, orangutan
I'm the Kush God, bitch you should claim the fame
I'm a prophecy dawg, not to be crossed, nigga
You can't fuck with me I'm [nazi] to yall
Kill an I'm fleeing the crime scene
Pluck me a fine ting, gold cubans
Gold Roleys, diamond rings, floss
All rap on off wax high'd up
Train of thought off track
I pop bottles like I pop my collar
Niggas talk lots of garbage but not a dollar
Shake hand with millionaires exchange the power
No daps to bums, head nods and hollas
Niggas fake if you ask me, classy
They like me better when I was fucked up and ashy
But actually

[Hook: Smoke Dza & CJ Fly]
They act like they wish me well
So I act like I believe them
Uh, humble till you piss me off
Just give me a reason, uh
Life moves so fast but on the gas stops
No I won't crash, I can't be stopped I'll have my rum

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Fly like I'm on trapeze
Bomber after bomber match me
I'm in the game homie peep my stat sheet
Amerikkkan Korruption, long live Capt. STEEZ
4-7 shift, nigga never quit, cut cloth from the thoroughest
Urban terrorist, that Lo shit is embedded in me
My old lady push a 750, killing bitches delicately
Don't hate get cheddar with me, enough
For everybody to eat, carmines, hustler
Carl hines] u really a moron if you sleep
Must be on leak, stuck on Hennessy beach, nah' mean?
Know I come from the streets, nah' mean?
None of you niggas could take me off my diem
Folks gone cop, hoes gone flop
Bottom line, the show don't stop
DZA!
