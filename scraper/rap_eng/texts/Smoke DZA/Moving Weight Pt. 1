[Intro]
Uh
DZA Riiight

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Pop sick bitch stressing me out
Need some air got to get the fuck out
That's a understatement
King of the under pavement
Real New Yorker Knick fan when they was under Layden
Underrated under paid 'em
Nah dog I'm from the money makin'
If it's money there I find a way in
They jack a nigga blatant
Call 'em out they be shocked
Fuck is you rated in the streets
You was in the crib watching That's So Raven
I'm a known problem
Old Harlem talkin' buildings vacant
Young OG gate keeper they come through
I embrace 'em on that sour plant
Hustlin wonderin' where the day went
By the big Tony your bitch unrolled me
Nigga I'm a made man
Hear the flow picture all the imagery
In and out the bank where you never be
Faded off the Hennessy
Fucking bitches out in Paris
Stumbled out the spot like Groove in House Party

[Hook]
Moving weight
Thinking how much I'm a do today
Laundry bag full super play
Know I got to get this cake
Off the radar got to play it safe
Call me up and I be on my way
Moving weight
Thinking how much I'm a do today
Call me up and I be on my way
Moving weight
Thinking how much I'm a do today
Call me up and I be on my way

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Here come the NARCS again
Yeah, it's me they targeting
We could shoot it out and take me in
I ain't bargainin'
Bullet vest 9 mil still
Under the cardigan
Regular hoes on delta, the bad ones I charter in
Nope not again
Look he droppin' the drop again
I could go Margiela, Jordan, Timberland, Moccasins
It get ug-lay
Dope game is lovely
Snake skin and suede seats
Cocaine buffets
Bad bitches in the tub
Tell em they all luck-ay
Grab me a condom gave her the rubber duck-ay
She like a lizard her tongue exquisite
I had to dig it
Grab the digits bag the sickness
Now back to business
I'm like a wizard with coke
Suppliants had to visit
Sniff it
Lick they fingers after it's that delicious
Hoe its money
Plant bombs it's that ridiculous
Snatch your kids grab your misses
Smack the mistress

[Hook]
Moving weight
Thinking how much I'm a do today
Laundry bag full super play
Know I got to get this cake
Off the radar got to play it safe
Call me up and I be on my way (way)
Moving weight
Thinking how much I'm a do today
Call me up and I be on my way (way)
Moving weight
Thinking how much I'm a do today
Call me up and I be on my way (way)

[Verse 3: Smoke DZA]
On the real
All you rap niggas know the drill
Oh you so original
Yet you jackin' me still
Ill spark a L
Niggas bars is shit it should come with Cottonelle
Call up a freak queue up the Akinyele
Met her on Broadway right by the corporal
Ran up in that bitch like I'm Jim Jones
Moving weight and I ain't been to the gym once

[Verse 4: NymLo]
I only fuck with niggas like me
And I ain't never met no others niggas like we
Im still the same nigga since the 4 wing pork fried rice 3 duck sauce and Chinese Iced-Tea
Cold cash a nigga pockets on freeze
By the time you hear this verse I'll be landin' in Indonesia
I traveled the world straight off dope
Alejandro with the cargo get it straight off boat
For real

[Hook]
Moving weight
Thinking how much I'm a do today
Laundry bag full super play
Know I got to get this cake
Off the radar got to play it safe
Call me up and I be on my way (way)
Moving weight
Thinking how much I'm a do today
Call me up and I be on my way (way)
Moving weight
Thinking how much I'm a do today
Call me up and I be on my way (way)
