[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
Went from a naughty boy to 'Lo, double R.L
Purple labeled cartel, coke head Kleinfeld
Crooked lawyer part of my clientele
My clients maybe speak, but my clients never tell
I cuffed my main bitch when Papi made bail
I'ma sell in the cell, talk biz on my cell
What up, not you nigga, us
Fuck I need Premo or Just, I got L's
Double barrel Mossberg, buckshot shells
With this rap shit I'm sick, y'all better wish me well
Flamboyant like Big L, flash like Tony
Want chicas, champagne, my friends call me Bori
Smoking on a bogey, presidential rollie
Oh no, oh he, the bitches call me handsome
Trying to rob my style, who paying for the ransom?
Questioning my G, this is my only answer

[Hook: Smoke DZA]
Riiiiiiiiiiight, fuck what you heard what's the word, it's
Big business here, leave that bullshit on the curb ‘cause
It's them Tanboys, Tanboys
It's them Tanboys, Tanboys

[Verse 2: Al-Doe]
Uh, landed in my sweatsuit
Signed an autograph, now it's on to the next shoot
DSQUARED bubble get my pic snapped
Took your bottom bitch, gave me top till her lips chapped
I'm in the house now, trouble what the club bring
Pinky finger no ice, I'd rather a drug ring
Hella snort at the heliport
Lead showers nothing like what your umbrella caught
My blood brothers get blood diamonds
Connects stay in my ear like fuck rhyming
Huh, I don't show what I'm spraying
A head nod, no words, but he know what I'm saying
‘Cause it was, Soundview, pulled the gun and he swerved
They said they heard the shots out on 183rd, nigga
Twenty-five to life, never did a one to three
Luck told me fuck a Bugatti, I need a hundred keys

[Hook: Smoke DZA]
Riiiiiiiiiiight, fuck what you heard what's the word, it's
Big business here, leave that bullshit on the curb ‘cause
It's them Tanboys, Tanboys
It's them Tanboys, Tanboys
