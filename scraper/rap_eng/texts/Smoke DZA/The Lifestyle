[Verse 1]
So high, nigga lost service
Backwoods, twisting up Bourbons
Squad deep, look at them nervous
Dirt bikes, this shit looking like Sturgis, hmmm
Niggas got courage, look at them flourish, hmmm
Where them curves went? You should fire that surgeon, hmmm
Look at them working, you see the way that work went, hmmm
Things that make you go, hmmm
Hopped out the womb, fogged up the room
Flowered the street, watch how it bloom
Roll up repeat, regroup resume
Highlights, premium servants, Kushed God, kill 'em with sermons

[Chorus]
Kill 'em in furs and kill em in Sherlin's
Kill it and curve it
Kill it and curve it

[Verse 2]
On point, know how to maneuver
Blueprint, you been one of my muses
God like, one eye on Judas
Hustler, in the land of users
Don't confuse us, we shakers movers
Hotbox Ubers, I don't do hookah
Roofless, like the coupe is
My whole style I done deuced it
Came back on some new shit in my back like a booster
He paid? Dique, my account on Green Bay
My chick like cliche five star cheap dates
Fucking up that mahi-mah, bunch of chips I carry cards
Quiet naps while I recharge
Raf Simmons Adidas, Uptown I reside

[Chorus]
Kill 'em in furs and kill em in Sherlin's
Kill it and curve it
Kill it and curve it
Kill it and curve it
