[Verse 1: Cyhi Da Prince]
Yea, she was the best ho I ever had
She bought me everything, I can't help but brag
My patna asked me can he hit her so I let him smash
Now every time he ask to hit her I say where the cash
She a ho, but I love her like my bottom bitch
She even helped me get the money I bought my Monte Carlo with
She did a lot of shit, put rims on my old school
She knew we liked to rap, she went and bought us Pro Tools
She was born in Arizona
Her mama and them was Spanish so they named her Marijuana
Got some family down in Mexico, but they ain't never want her
They disowned her, now she sell her stuff on every corner
Prostitution was her top solution
So if you gettin' blowed by her thanks for the contribution
Cause Mary Jane bought me everything
So if I had to wife a chick I think that I would marry Jane

[Hook: Cyhi Da Prince]
First girl I ever fell in Love with was (Mary Jane)
I bought my first set of dubs, guess who gave me money (Mary Jane)
You see this chain around my neck you know who got it for me (Mary Jane)
I wouldn't be the man that I am if it wasn't for (Mary Jane)

[Verse 2: Cyhi Da Prince]
Ok, when we first met, we were green to some things
As a teen, I never knew how much cream she would bring
A couple years went by, and she dyed her hair red
Now every hood nigga wanna be seen with my queen
But I broke the bitch down and made her into a dime
Put her in the car, and sat her next to a Nine
She knew if I get caught, I'd probably go do some time
But nigga's rather do her, before they go do a line
I made a K in a day, it felt like I hit the lottery
Cause in the streets of the A she was such a hot commodity
I'm making money off the pot, that's pottery
I knew a bunch of niggas who wanted to holla at her, obviously
She made a play to pay my bond, I felt like Sean Connery
She wasn't fond of me, she started sellin' pussy in front of me
When she was runnin' with the trappers, she called herself Sha'Reefa
When she started datin' rappers, she changed her name to Keisha

[Hook: Cyhi Da Prince]
But to me bitch you still (Mary Jane)
I bought my first set of dubs, guess who gave me money (Mary Jane)
You see this chain around my neck you know who got it for me (Mary Jane)
I wouldn't be the man that I am if it wasn't for (Mary Jane)

[Verse 3: Smoke DZA]
He has risen, roll up my breakfast
Whatever's leftover you keep the extras
Put you out if you restless
Tell that chatterbox don't blow my high with that lecture
That'll lead to my exit
That joint is anorexic, where's the bud
Motherfuck how you text it, scrubs
Sellin' that dirt, should get caught by the Fuzz
That blueberry shit is a dud, ugh
I wouldn't take it for the love
That type of shit don't even get me high, just kill the buzz
Kushedgod, roll up, but no mids here
That'll get you thrown out the jet, mid-air
Stoners and hustlers only, you can't sit here
Spark up a blimp, it's about to be a good year, yea
Smell the aroma from the corner, nigga
Lookin' for my phone and I'm on it, shit I'm stoned kid
