[Intro]
Today I got time cuz
Can I talk to 'em for a second?
Let me talk to 'em for a second
Today I got time cuz

[Verse 1]
Lil' homie like "DZA bet I get higher than you"
Boy that's 36 thousand feet what you trying to do?
I don't entertain the bullshit unless I'm in the mood
Deion Sanders wear my chains inside of the pool
Must be the money got a nigga acting a fool
Expensive dinners, prime one one two
Shout out to Krizzle, that's my nigga
Chop it with Wiz, low riders with Spitta
Killing the stance, retired the phones
Stunting on niggas, don't try this at home
Don't try this at home
Only killer inside of my combs
Risk take, thirty days got a big face
2010 started touring off mixtapes
On jeez, keep it cool like a fall breeze
I swear I got high and saw STEEZ

[Hook]
I smoke blunts to the face so don't pass me shit
Rather die smoking bombers than them nasty clips
I ain't always home
But guaranteed I'm always stoned
I smoke blunts to the face so don't pass me shit
Rather die smoking bombers than them nasty clips
I ain't always home
But guaranteed I'm always stoned

[Verse 2]
My perspective puffing sativa
Halla from 49th got the chicken on pita
Like lennox watching FIFA
Don't bring no scared business them man might a creep up
Top notch chiefa
Need 16 lungs to keep up
And I stay steamin'
Probably smoke all your weed up
Nigga I'm just dab rig chocking
Big blunt rolling
Talking how I talk it take it uptown on 'em
First they act like it ain't nothing special and then they sweat
Uncle Snoop said you got 'em nephew its all chess moves
Turkey bag open on the counter top
Smoked an insane amount of pot
Half a pound for a freestyle
Still got Bubsie on speed dial

[Hook]
I smoke blunts to the face so don't pass me shit
Rather die smoking bombers than them nasty clips
I ain't always home
But guaranteed I'm always stoned
I smoke blunts to the face so don't pass me shit
Rather die smoking bombers than them nasty clips
I ain't always home
But guaranteed I'm always stoned
