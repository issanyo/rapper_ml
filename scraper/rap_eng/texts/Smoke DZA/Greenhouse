[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
The game is on orange, nigga
I said it's time to stop playin' with these little bitches like Lawrence
Tailored, Lauren down to the bottom garments
Puffing on chronic, bout to push the button
Who want it?
I may be cool but them niggers over there orny
Don't be a fool and get your little entourage cornin'
I'm the [sada nunce?] of 2k
Closed caskets slow songs and bouquets
Headband L's, cool J's
Hall of Fame modein', 2kin'
I may be laughing at y'all niggers but who's playing?
Not I said the pothead guy
You got me fucked up
They hated on me now they give me becky
Brought the loud to Hollygrove for my nigga Nesbie
911 boy you know where to catch me
Shit is about to get messy
Right

[Smoke DZA speaking:]
You got to pay for this game
Not even a freestyle is free

Welcome to the greenhouse

[George Bush soundbite]
That is valuable information for those of us how have the responsibility to protect the American people he told us that the operatives have been instructed to insure that the explosives went off (Welcome to the greenhouse) a point that was high enough to prevent the people trapped from above to escape. Imma describe the plan of attack on buildings in the US...

[Verse 2]
This game here's for pros once God give in dough
Plus I hawk niggas with this Anarchtica flow
What a cold piece of work I am 3 series riding from the dirty rotten

I'm from the Mecca of fly shit, so how could I not be on my shit?
Right
