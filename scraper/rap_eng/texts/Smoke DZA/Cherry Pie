[Intro]

Nostra, nostra.. Ricky Hil

[Hook: 2X]

Daddy wanna Chevy
Momma got a caddy
Hoes wanna fuck me
Bitches wanna have me
Smoking cherry pie
Cherry Pie
Cherry Pie
Cherry Pie
Cherry Pie

[Verse 1: Ricky Hil]

Bitch I'm to swag for that lame shit
I don't really give a fuck what your name is
I don't really give a fuck if your famous
I just want to bust a nut where your face is
Ill poppin pills Give them bitches Molly
Ricky Hil SlickVille is what they call me
Give her Cherry Pie, got her very high
I can't deny the Cherry Pie be burning very nice
Black Chevy bitch, fast Ford
Got the pills and the weed in the dashboard
We about a half away from bridgeport
Misfit state of mind what I live for

[Hook]

[2nd Verse: Smoke DZA]

Riiiiiiight!
It's the kush god you know I'm very high
Like martin in life tryna get to that Cherry Pie, cherry pie heavy eyes
Amateurs try to hit this out of a bong shit I bet he die
Cough up a lung off this joint I brung
Bound to have a nigga done, sprinkled 'bout a gram of hash
Sure to have you on your ass
Only iron man could smoke with me
I sleep him in the long run
Niggas know George Kush loaded on one

[Hook]

[3rd Verse: Ricky Hil]

Get it poppin bitches
I make it happen captain
I'm the illest bitches
Hoes love my accent
I dont have one
I walk a bad one
I spark a fat one
Heavy weight motherfucker, 484
Crown vic with my arm rested on the door
Heavy weight motherfucker ain't a metaphor
484, them bitches want more
I get it for the low, I get it for the cheap
I rock my pants low, my hat say Supreme
I'mma ill motherfucker baby ain't I
I'mma ill motherfucker baby ain't i
