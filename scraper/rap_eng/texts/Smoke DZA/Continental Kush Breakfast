[George Bush]
"During these last few months, I told our country,and I told the world. Shut the fuck up! And smoke my weed!"

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
The fuck, where's the weed
I'm up, the Headband's calling me
Handle things accordingly, thank the Lord
Grab my papers, time for an early session
Head stash the size of the pillow I rest my head on
Dead on, dip in my ashtray instead
Got one pre-rolled, so breakfast in bed it is
That lemon-lime shit, bomb shit
Still hungry, leftovers in my grinder
This a continental kush breakfast
So good got a nigga going for seconds
I'm a continental type of nigga
Continental flights, first class attender
Mile High member, High Times DZA
Fly as fuck so we're puffing on killa
George W, and the W stands for winner
Don't make me push the button on you niggas, uh

[Hook: Den10]
As the world keeps turning and the kush keeps burning
Wake and bake every morning like the sun when it's rising
I light, this the life
The connects confidential and the weed's continental
Like the planes and my Bentley and my Roley's presidential
With ice, so they like

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Wake up and smell the dour
It's still a marathon, I'm lighting hour after hour
Here on in, that PK start to creep up
Niggas falling, tapping out, tryna keep up
Catch me if you can, this the Kemp dog man
Lit Ras up and I finish bredgrin
Bring baby lungs out of the cradle
Tryna smoke with the big boys
We smoke em under the table, for real
I don't smoke nickels, it ill
Try this Bubble Kush out, see how this feel
High of two pulls, you gotta good deal
Room all cloudy off that Humbolt county
It's the beginning of a good day
Good morning Autobahn, where's the good haze?
Neighbors beefin' about the smell, but I'm sorry
Every morning religiously salute Mr. Marley, what up

[Hook: Den10]
As the world keeps turning and the kush keeps burning
Wake and bake every morning like the sun when it's rising
I light, this the life
The connects confidential and the weed's continental
Like the planes and my Bentley and my Roley's presidential
With ice, so they like
