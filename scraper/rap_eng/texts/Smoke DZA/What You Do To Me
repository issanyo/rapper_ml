[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I don't know what it is, but something's coming over me
My heart is beating hard as hell, I'm seeing two of everything
I don't know what it is, but something's coming over me
I'm getting freaky than a motherfucker, girl what you put in this weed

[Verse: Smoke DZA]
I don't know if it's your love or it's the bud
I don't know whether the fuss, I think your [?]
A bad dream  couldn't fuck this up
We get high she soak the sweat, then suck it up
Literally, figuratively
She turn into Italian blue when she freaking with me
We be rolling up and fucking, take a nap by time
She roll over we be puffing, ready to do it again
Don't worry if i'm cheating cause I love you within
Same way we love God, but we always sin
Freak off, take the car for a spin
Just cop the new [?], bout to break it in
Her body cold as fuck
Guarantee good pussy when she rolling up
I hit this Dutch
Then it's back to action cause she knows what's up

[Hook:]
