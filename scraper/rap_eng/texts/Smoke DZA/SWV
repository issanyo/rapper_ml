[Hook: Mookie Jones]
Anywhere I wanna, light up marijuana
Imma turn that motherfucka into southern California
Anywhere I wanna, light up marijuana
Imma turn that motherfucka into southern California

Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down

Blow the smoke into space
Blow smoke into space
Blow the smoke into space
Blow the smoke into space and tell em

Anywhere I wanna, light up marijuana
Imma turn that motherfucka into southern California
Pass it round
Pass it round
Pass it round
Pass it round

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Anywhere I wanna
I'm lightin' marijuana
You ain't gotta wonder if I am because I'm gonna
Shit I'm on that OG
Feelin' like a soma
Nigga fuck around and lose a lung and need a donor
Riding out with the windows up
We call that a hotbox
Coughing off the first pull
That's what you call some good pot
Smoke good, eat good, purple stuff in my cream soda
Got me on dead island
On the ledge about to lean over
But I'm still conscious enough to roll up
Discreet in the back seat watching for the Super Grovers
That's a toy cops, trynna stop a niggas flow
But I ain't worried 'bout them boys
Just roll some more dope

[Hook: Mookie Jones]
Anywhere I wanna, light up marijuana
Imma turn that motherfucka into southern California
Anywhere I wanna, light up marijuana
Imma turn that motherfucka into southern California

Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down
Burn it down

Blow the smoke into space
Blow smoke into space
Blow the smoke into space
Blow the smoke into space and tell em

Anywhere I wanna, light up marijuana
Imma turn that motherfucka into southern California
Pass it round
Pass it round
Pass it round
Pass it round

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
I'm in this hoe, I'm on that shit
I'm fuckin' lit like  "How the fuck did he get that gone this quick?"
And that's on my clique
I ain't loanin' shit
My persona thick, that's why these bitches on my dick
Niggas be on that fuck shit
We are not to be fucked with
And I could give two fucks bitch
So tell your friend she can come with
Have you trippy off one hit
You can't even function
Trynna fight the Temptations man
I feel like David Ruffin
Like my nigga DZA said
We gon' fucking get this bread
Wolf Gang J.E.T.S. nigga
Put those who opposed to bed
"Here bitch, roll the midge"
Shit I tell my chick in here
Spark whenever we want nigga
Fuck security and the feds
