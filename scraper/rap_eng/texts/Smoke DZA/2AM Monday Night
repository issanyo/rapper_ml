[Intro]
Crush a bit - little bit - roll it up - take a hit
Crush a bit - little bit - roll it up - take a hit
Crush a bit - little bit - roll it up - take a hit (Shit fire though, why not?)
Feeling lit, feeling right, 2 AM, summer night

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Righttttttt
Mother made 'em - mother had 'em - motherfuck 'em
When we mob out, it's like Moscow by the way them niggas rushin'
Jet life - flyin' over everything nigga
Righttttt

Mother made 'em - mother had 'em - motherfuck 'em
When we mob out, it's like Moscow by the way them niggas rushin'
Hold ya head boy, hold the pause. Silencer, conceal the noise
Back out, hit these motherfuckers with the Holy Force
Kushed God, get ready for the Rapture, nigga smokin' on that masta
Bout to set this bitch up in flames and won't remember anything after
I want blood nigga, OJ with the glove on
Mad motherfucka like when all the bud gone
Only thing that can fix it is a bad bitch with a mouth I can fuck on

Let's get our buzz on
Sip 'till the mug gone
Ya' man tryna cop, I got the plug for him
Or make sure the paper right, or get left
And know that you fucking with some wildcats
Ant Davis, Gilchrest

Rightttttttt
