[Intro]
KushedGod bitch
Back in the building
Third... Right

[Verse 1]
Ringside 2 it's go time
Just the beginning of the end and it's the short clothesline
There's 28 grams of potency in the glad
Fuck up off me nigga I'm about to get Damien out the bag
God damnit DZA turned wrestling to a fad
It's the ruler I'm way cooler
Than all the rest of these fags
Got the IQ of Gordon Solie
Flows is holy
Murder you niggas doly
Whether your beliefs in God or Aleister Crowley
Run down on you nigga like ya'll don't know me
Shit couple fuck boys don't wanna see me eat
DZA destroy the town nigga DDT
Kickin' niggas off the apron
Belts and jackets made of snake skin
I'm used to the hatin'
So never mind the fuckery
Cause shit could get ugly
Trust me

[Outro]
See people wonder why does he do the things he do. Why does he do that? A lot of people wanna know where is he going. To know where I'm going you must know where I've been. And believe me you do not have a clue about where I've been. But let me tell you something simple as this Jesse. You know and I know it's much better to be the hunter than to be the hunted. And what I am in the WCW for is very simple. I don't want a piece of the world I want the whole world
