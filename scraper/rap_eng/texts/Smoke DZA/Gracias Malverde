[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
It's new prices on the fishscale
Ya, it's wet paint watch me fish tail
We sippin' Don P for the celebration
And you ain't on nobodys list clown
I bubbled crack just to double the bank
They wanted soft but they fell in love with that H
They telling stories I'm fresh from it all
Fuck 'em it's more than a mic and a ball
Glocks flying get your popcorn ready we know
Can't find work you heard, what up T.O
Bitches think they know it all, that's Miss Cleo
Balloon full of tress and my man [?]
Me and you other niggas livin' different
Curveball you had the white, but we was pitching different
Ya, so if that's not you you gon' get to snitchin'
Cause to your old head you forgot to listen, you a damn shame

[Break]
Now listen, it's a gang of niggas gettin' money
It's also a gang of niggas snitchin'
You can think I'm playin' if you want to
I ain't never been with the bullshit
But shit ain't right, shit ain't right
I just call it how I see it nephew
I'm to the box with mine
Tell them I said that, and let's get back to that real shit one time

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Swear to god almost died off that last dab
No chatter cause this shatter come with ass bags
Bombers and promethazine that do the trick
Dropped a little ash in my cup, I hate that shit
My nigga Chev came through in the clutch
Poured a whole two and I'm stuck, good lookin'
[?] sippin' nigga I'm tryna keep it slow
And truthfully I'm tryna cop a four
Getting to the dough like the Brinks
Eight inch [?] and minks
Big gold Cuban links
Hustler attire, puffin' on some fire
Can't get any higher, if I do I might fucking explode
But after that wear off I need something to roll
Kush got body got a goddess in my lap
Rap money slow up could always get it with the packs
