You hear that dick sucker? That’s the sound of money
Right
Real life shit
I had to do that
Yeah
Riiight


(verse 1)
You know I’m wildin, wheelin n dealin
Stylin n profilin. Jet flyin/ I’m chillin
Classic give you a feelin. Taylor made my appearance
Sippin outta success fountain/bitches ridin space mountain
Rolex on cuff….clean
Custom robes…mean
Spill more champagne than you bought
Expensive threads/you ain’t cut from my cloth
Full length mink draggin on the floor
Stuntin on em as I’m struttin thru the door
You wonder the price, you figure four
I’m like “Nah, figure more”

Rugby


(Outro: Rick Flair)
I’m the best! Whether you like it or not….you’re lookin at [WOO]
The greatest wrestler, the best looking man, the best dressed man
Long Liveth He!
Jet air planes, custom made clothes, and any woman in the world I want
Just like that. You know why?! [WOO] Because my name’s Rick Flair and because I’m the world heavyweight wrestling champion
