[Verse 1 – Le$]
Just tryna stay up out that life
Them goofy niggas caught up in that hype
Doing it for likes while I’m rolling up a gram
This a different type of language that the chosen understand
Angry shit, I might answer them demons, I see em scheming
Fiending for my position, well player just keep dreaming
They really ain’t sleeping, they just play like they deaf
Not much time left, say hello to the death
I be the grim reaper, hustle niggas out the sneakers
Don’t respect you like a substitute teachers
Same niggas hating want a feature now
I had her for the night but you can keep her now
No surprise how them sucker niggas leeching
[?] to the team, cool J’s hate to see you do your thing
But I’m bringing home the ring, everybody season
We ain’t leaving till we kill it
Just life bitch, we eating till we finished

[Hook][x2]
I’m gonna get paid, and can’t a damn thing stop me [x3]
Think not, this [?]

[Verse 2 – Smoke DZA]
I’m off the meds nigga
420 minutes off the latch nigga
Two minutes till black that from the feds nigga
And bout a millisecond off your head nigga
Bread winner, far from an amateur
Came back from the land of raw, snuck some shit to Panama
Just ain’t right if the pack ain’t here
The last time I visit, the pack wasn’t there
Shit I stay in vagina, addicted to marijuana
But I swear to my mama, I got to be baked as shit
It’s all facts when you dishing these lines
Not a designer rapper fabricating his lines
It’s all real though, fuck the cool
Shit it’s the hill flow
Plus a nigga kick it like I’m kicking with a steel toe
Getting something nigga [?]
Sipping [?] at the [?]

[Hook][x2]
