[Verse]
Madness, rope swing comin’ down with a bad bitch
No passes, you don’t wanna get on my blacklist
These asses think it’s a game I think not
[?] catch a flyin’ axe handle from the top
Forever great man, the reign don’t stop
Hustle bud, master of the elbow drop
Who want some? There’s more than enough pot
More than enough spots, more than enough [?]
King, accept the throne, get extra dome
All I need is a queen’s cherry and a hefty comb, dig it?
Put on the clinic it’s all authentic
The whips is tinted, it’s my house you just a tenant, nigga
In it to win it we break rules
Either you gon’ pay in pain or pay dues
They come to play and they lose
Savage, no one else is a [?]
