[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Uh
I don't shed a tear
I just put one in the air
For my niggas that ain't here
For my favorite uncle Kenny we lost him last year
I swear to god life ain't fair
I be illin'
Now I get this roller coaster feelin' every time I think of Kenyetta and the way them niggas killed him
I be hurtin'...pissed
They took a little brother away from Trish
That was my little man and shit
I remember when I got that call
Only thing I kept sayin' was "Not my dawg"
Ain't a day I don't think bout you lil bro
And the fact I ain't know about your funeral
Had a nigga miserable
I don't really smoke haze that often
But I'll light this hundred up for you
'Cause where you at now you's a lucky dude
'Cause where I'm at I don't be knowin' what the fuck to do
Lost

[Hook]
Big dudes and Hennessy
Reminiscing in your memories
I can't understand why
I'm on so hard and don't cry no lie
Cause I don't shed a tear
I just put one in the air (x4)

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Uh
What up Petey know you see a nigga shinin' now
And every time the sun shine you smilin' down
You probably talkin' smack with Miss Scott
And a bag of fish fry in the sky I'm
Lightin' this joint joint for you
Killa woo ATI what it do
What up Yosh?
A nigga gettin' spins now
Guess these douchebags know what it is now
You being gone still a wild thought
Should of kept you closer feel like it was my fault
Tried to tell you chill but chill don't pay the bills
And when a nigga starvin' he do what ever to get that meal
Can't forget my homie Lonnie
What up playboy I ain't forget about you
I know you up in heaven like a don
Make sure you tell 'em about your nigga Sean
Uh

[Hook]
Big dudes and Hennessy
Reminiscing in your memories
I can't understand why
I'm on so hard and don't cry no lie
Cause I don't shed a tear
I just put one in the air (x4)
