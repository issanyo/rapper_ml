[Hook: Big KRIT]
Ain't much for free nowadays? Gotta get paid
Ain't much for free nowadays? Gotta get paid
Ain't much for free nowadays? Gotta get paid
Ain't much for free nowadays? Gotta get paid
Making moves 45, 600 different ways

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA
It's the chronolog for hustlers, I'm giving lessons
Get your supplies portioned out for the masses
1 25 12's in caskets
And got a bunch of hungry niggers on they half shit
Got more than one spot and I'm stashing
Picture me keeping all of my eggs in one basket
I took a gamble with this rap shit, and I here cracked it
But I'm still active, can't get passed it
The streets keep calling my name
Until them budgets open up I'mma be doing my thing
Jersey nigga want ten, Brooklyn nigga want five
All I'm thinking is my PC looking real right

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Copped the burner folder and I got rid of the Kia
Switch it up every 6 months, it's hard to keep up
Me and my mans caught a leg now we up
My only mission is to not fuck up the re-up
Lord knows I got a rugby fetish
Every time I peace drop a nigga gotta get it
Hater nigga begging, just be sounding real pathetic
You heard what Big said, start asking 'bout credit? Forget it
I don't know nothing 'bout that
I don't trust the soul, my own uncle ran off with a pack
It's strictly business nigga: Waymon Tisdale
You ain't trying to cash out, God bless

[Hook]
