[Hook]
I hustle 'till the last breath
You know the grind never ends
It ain't a "i" in team but there's a "i" in win
I do this for the win
I do this for the win
I do this for the win
I do this for the win

[Verse 1]
Put me anywhere Imma still bubble
You know I always got a good hustle
Set up the play in the last huddle
I'm going for the Bill Russell
Perrier showers
Hotel suites full of broads lighting sour
Ball for the win 'cuz the bread come with power
Big money phone calls every other hour
You in it for the race I'm in it for the marathon
You tryna find a shortcut but I rather none
Go by the same philosophy that I instilled in my son
You can only get better kid stick to your guns
It's real simple
When they hating make sure you smile, show 'em your dimples
Everything else go out the window
Because nothing else matter but the win, yo

[Hook]
I hustle 'till the last breath
You know the grind never ends
It ain't a "i" in team but there's a "i" in win
I do this for the win
I do this for the win
I do this for the win
I do this for the win

Everyday we live life is a celebration
Five star no reservations
They show love no hesitation
My O.G's glad to see elevation
Right, I live for the now
Super cool cat yeah I been in the crowd
Sprinkle (?) on my poison of style
So when they bite it they eventually die
I live to get fly, get money
You out here hungry then you living a lie
Get down with the squad, you could use the help
Ain't no need to front 'cuz you'll fool yourself
Don't underestimate, confuse yourself
Who ever thought Tyson would lose the belt?
Keep it G stay true to self
And you'll win when them cards are dealt, believe that

[Hook]
I hustle 'till the last breath
You know the grind never ends
It ain't a "i" in team but there's a "i" in win
I do this for the win
I do this for the win
I do this for the win
I do this for the win
I hustle 'till the last breath
You know the grind never ends
It ain't a "i" in team but there's a "i" in win
I do this for the win
I do this for the win
I do this for the win
I do this for the win
