I will rock it not, bitch
Remain emotionless, on some Doctor Spock shit
Robot nigga, Inspector Gadget with ratchet
Go-go four-four blood in your back bitch
Listen, I will bash your brain
With a walking stick, bitch felt the wrath of Kane
Bullets make you dance, scoop, and scrap lover
Fuck firin' on fam, we could scrap sucka
This nigga said he know fifty too
Shot up in the elbow, let's see what that shit can do
You whack! Be hatin'
Date rape satan, initiate freebasin
Niggas hate the oaf
Go cover bloods from the fuckin' sacred goat
What the fuck that mean?
Sean Price the nicest nigga that's on Buckshot Team

[Chorus x2]
You fuck with me I'll have her tied up in the crib
Like fuck your mother, she's a stupid little bitch
I banged her about ten times a night, bitch
She ain't nothin' but a little fight

Kiss the motherfuckin' ring, we on some mob shit
Shit on that pity party, fuck that sob shit
Disrespect you, open neck you, hog spit
Have my man Blizz violate your carcass
Frank Matthews, catch me if you can
Treat a hatin' ass nigga like Spam, ignored him
You ain't cop that piece from the district, you copped that from ?
You don't come straight for the re-up, nigga, always be shorten
Always talkin' that bread shit
But when them niggas come out with them big toys
You be on that givin' head shit
Kill yourself, your whole life is whack
Thirty-five and still sellin' crack? Grow up nigga
The other day homie copped a benz
Call yourself a kingpin and you're still coppin' twenty grams
Fuck outta here nigga, scram, you a peon
You should get peed on
R Kelly style, little niggas trilly wild

[Chorus]
Good job you fuckin' pricks
? and fuck your mother

Push God, bitch
