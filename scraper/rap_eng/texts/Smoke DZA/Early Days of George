[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Riiight, burn the block down now I'm raping the spot
They blowing up my phone got 'em waiting to cop
Un, drought here so I'm raising the stocks
I been grinding since TDKs with the tape on the top
Un, getting schooled by my uncle Kenny Brooks
Early 90s when the money was coming in books
Me and my niggas use to wrestle in the basement
All I wanted was some Lo and a fresh pair of eights then
Fast-forward few years I had eighths and
Quarters too for the affordable
A few of my friends was on the crack and the coke scale
I hit Cali and got the ticket on the whole sale

[Hook]
(Un) This is the story of a come up
(Riiight) 25-8 till the sun up
(Riiight) You already know my status par
This is my Hustler's Catelog

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
(Un) From my nigga Spitta view, I think I see his vison too
Jet planes super highed up flying to Peru
In a high rise flying through cities
Living like spies, story of our lives
We hustle and thats the truth
I know my mama glad I raise my ass off that stoop
And got a little clout
Gotta feed a lot of mouths
But you know I'm still hookie pookie in
Got one foot in one foot out
Tried to be relax
But everytime shit gets ill shit be still
Calling me back its a force
Fascinated by it something like an allure
Do this shit for the cause, Mane (Mane)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Smoke DZA]
Ridin' dirty with dutchie behind the wheel
Like we ain't lighting shit till we get outta here
I was kinda shook up I ain't gone front
You would be too with Max B numbers in the trunk
The PC was sweeter than sweet tea
Got me out the slump ate Peter Lugers for lunch
Thats how a boss should eat though
Hustle hard cause' every day my twins feet grow
(Un) Baby sitter ain't cheap, bitch want 400 a week
But on the bright side it could be all worse
Tax returns hit cop more work

[Hook]
