[Intro]
Right
I got two zips. Two bitches with tounge rings who suck a dick
Young nigga tryna get rich
I used to be skinny but I used to be broke too
I guess that matters

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Righttttttttttttt
You know my slogan: Hollywood Smoke Hogan
I ain't good with the slick talk, I put hands on you like I'm molding
And I ain't talkin' bout no vase nigga; tommy hitman hearns, I hit hard nigga
This that Clinton Correctional flow, shit a nigga got bars nigga
Welcome to the Wreck Shop. Too much hard, that's what got my nigga Reck shot
Came in this bitch just to get guap, lil' nigga I make the back of yo' neck hot
I got a flight in a few. To the bank is my next stop
Pot in the air, know the Jets out
Lil' bitch over there bout to pass out
Smoker's Club - OG - rose gold, big face Rollie
My little man came whippin' in the stolee and I'm still on the corner like Bodie (Huuuh?)
If you book me, I hope you got the Fire Marshalls right there
'Cuz the Kushed God's a non-smoking biddy's worst nightmare
