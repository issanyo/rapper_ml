[Verse:]
Yow man you linked Quann today
No man, I’m fucked up man
Rest up for a little bit
For what
Man them [?] they got me outta my zone man
But I be fucked up man
Nigga are you depressed
No not really man
You sound depressed
Man pull your skirt down B [?]
She’s fucked up
You always in your zone, can’t nobody take you out your zone
