[Intro: Smoke DZA]
Uh, DZA, D.R.A.M
Really

[Chorus: DRAM]
I said we went from plaid boxers to Polo briefs
And I show my ass
See these horses that's up on me
So we went from nickel bags to oz's
So we came up, way up yeah
We went from chasing hoes to chasing cheese
And your bitch mad
You mad cause she's on me
And we went from IOU's to what you need?
So we came up, way up yeah

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Really fucking cool, keep it frost
Ain't shit changed but the weather and my drawers
Sour coming out of my pores
Under the tobacco, Vanill- of course
I smell like boss, look like wealth
Through that wave
I'm Mike Phelps, you that maid
Look like help
Tryna find the plug, I'm the plug myself
You ain't gotta kiss the ring shawty, kiss my belt
My life right now got me like I love my health
But I'm still like something got to give
A lot of niggas die before they dead, I gots to live
I came from the bottom, not a pot to piss and shit
Like a million others but what make me different is
I turned my dreams to reality
Come through the hood casually
Few niggas salty but I know I'm who they rather be
Get money, take care of the faculty

[Chorus: DRAM]
I said we went from plaid boxers to Polo briefs
And I show my ass
See these horses that's up on me
So we went from nickel bags to oz's
So we came up, way up yeah
We went from chasing hoes to chasing cheese
And your bitch mad
You mad cause she's on me
And we went from IOU's to what you need?
So we came up, way up yeah

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Take credit for the wins and losses
I now what I know, I just search for the reassurance
Niggas dying to be important
Souls get bought quite often
No integrity, what you talking?
All things, offsprings get lost in
The systems of these streets we involved in
Either you crack slinging or balling
The American dream to get rich and the whole hood all in
Hustlers will, watch me maneuver through
Prime example, you could do it too
In my lane speeding like I'm Ricky Bobby
Posted up in any lobby
Six degrees of separation, I give it to anybody
Faded off the sour and the Henny probably
Get rich schemes, I got many hobbies
League of my own, I ain't got many rivalries
9/11 you know where I be
Unlimited credit line with Ikea

[Chorus: DRAM]
I said we went from plaid boxers to Polo briefs
And I show my ass
See these horses that's up on me
So we went from nickel bags to oz's
So we came up, way up yeah
We went from chasing hoes to chasing cheese
And your bitch mad
You mad cause she's on me
And we went from IOU's to what you need?
So we came up, way up yeah
