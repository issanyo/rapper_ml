[Intro: Smoke DZA]
DZA
I guess its safe to say we back at it huh?
Uh
Kush God bitch
Its that easy, its that easy
Right
Really fucking cool
Ski Beatz
Let's make this move
Uh

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Niggas dragging their feet
They ain't half as elite as the god
Don't believe everything you see on blogs
Niggas hate, they be on drugs
The heater on and we on buzz
Watch it, have my feet on mud
Stomping out that mother fucker like the swamp thing
Gossip shorty, you can kiss my long thing
(?) me
Why is it so corny these days
Young 'uns don't want to be raised
Disrespect the corners we made
Tell me something now, you're boring me man
Facts
Indie album cashing quarterly man
Facts
Side bar
One of the illest on wax
New legends, Syliva passed
But I'ma let history have it's way with that
Put out my bread, make it bck
Times five
Six figures, no three sixty
I'm live
Coming from the 212
Whatever you want to do
I'm with it, nigga where's the digits

[Bridge: Smoke DZA]
Young, black, and gifted
And everything above

[Verse 2]
The time is here
Fully equipped stay lit
And prepared
Niggas sneak but I'm too high to care
What's the wise idea
To get cute with me
Better off forming a truce with me
Truthfully
Fucking as the tour bus cruise
And truthfully
Should have dropped George Kush 2
But I got more moves
Before I get back to pushing a button on
Fake prophets and weirdo dudes
I'm in my groove
Cool picture, capture move
Keep drag (?) dude
Its my house, you could bounce
Music's spreading in places I can't pronounce
Passport stamped so much I lost count
I don't know
I don't know
Soon as I think I'm settled in
I got to go
The life of a rolling stone
But I'm rolling stoned
Rolling until its all gone

Young, black, and gifted
