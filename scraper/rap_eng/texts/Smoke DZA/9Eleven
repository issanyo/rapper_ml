Ugh

Ugh

And this for me and mines
Ugh

And this for me and my niggas
Ugh

Riiiiiiiiiiight

[Verse 1]
Ugh
I'm from the nine nigga, and this for me and my niggas
Started from nothin', nigga ground zero, way before I wrote my first rhyme nigga
Way before the shine nigga
To the man hallway with the sour smell [?]
They call us urban terrorist cause, we was 9 11 way before the towers fell
Back when the era was cracked up
P you was running up on niggas pasts ugh [?]
119th street, we renamed it cause everything backwards
I'm a murder side nigga, they tried to murder my nigga
Went and put tattoos around the gun wounds
And went harder with the crippin'
Thuggin' is understandable
Street shit could turn a nigga to an animal
How ya mind frame on some Vyvanse
Well livin' is all we plan to do
Bein' black ain't easy
Roll me up another joint, word to [?]
In the ack sippin' yack, with my nigga td
9 to nothin', on the block where we be

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Really, a product of the 9 now with my brother Willie [?]
Really, crushin' purple haze about to [?] to a philly
Illy, to make a nigga quit mothafuckas gotta kill me
Really, I wanna be great, you gotta feel me
I come from being piss poe, up in bob d with bach and brisco, junebug sippin' cisco
Petty dice games mad ones gotta [?]
Even the bitches get wicked
Even tougher than most niggas [?]
Tray deuce keep a [?]
Fuck around and get smoked will ya
It ain't real unless it's tatted on you
9 11 on my hand son
No matter where I'm at in the world, I remember where I came from
Boutta roll me up a quarter, continue to catch rap, that word to little Walter
Still piss by the garbage can on the corner
9 11 nigga till' I'm chillin' with the coroner

[Hook]
