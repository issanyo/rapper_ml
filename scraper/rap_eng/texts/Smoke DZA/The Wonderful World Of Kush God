[Intro]
Rrrrriiigght. Welcome to The Wonderful World Of The Kushed God
If you dont got one roled up already, get your untensils together
Lets burn out
Rrriiiight

[Verse 1]

A round of aplause
Secound album in store, Im fresh off tour, and Im back at yall
Rolling Stoned, hope you can hold your own, consistantly do this on, and on
Harlem's own. Certified, I ain't a new jack that just started coming outside
I been roastin, battles on 2 fifth, when Mart 125 was open
Ask about me, I put in enough work to get the brag rights
I was a bastard in my past life
Fast forward, still mad nice
The goal ain't changed, 'til the whole world know my name
Kush God, when they greet me
Im good in the hood, Im come through
I give'em hope when they see me
Rock on, keep the hope alive
Hard work pays off, just keep your head up high
Do you believe?

Its the Kush God
I do this for my niggas, and niggas like me
The rest of the world will catch on to it more than likely
It is what it is.. Let nigga live..
Rrrriiiiggghhhtt!
