[Verse 1]
I'm oozing with machismo
KushedGod bitch, back on beast-mode
I matador the bull like Tito
You niggas my hijos
Anytime I hop on the joint its a cheat-code
They hear me like, "He's cold"
Major league dough bring more bread in
Makers sharp and alcohol park them razors edge them
Most of my niggas is two time felons
Most of your niggas is queer as Ellen
Known for telling I ain't buying what they selling
Never that
You will always be a failure, nigga, remember that
You a walking Vick my whole cliques legit
All my niggas on top of the game like we rig this shit
Everyday not annual
I tell these niggas either handle the business or the business gon' handle you

[Hook]
Too slick to leave a trace
Murder scenes got a clean getaway
Weirdoes always seem out of places
Soon as they flip the toothpick in they face
I'm on that sour diesel
Broke nigga we could never be equal
After me it'll be no sequel
Nigga I'm oozing with machismo

[Razor Ramon Sound Bite]
