[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]

DZA, Its the John Dellinger flow
Kill a mother fucker yall actin like y'all don't know
I don't care if ya youtube views up bet 5 of y'all don't blow
Little niggas couldn't sit at the table with us
We push em to the side with the baby sitters
Boss shit, big money make em nauseous we target
Its only a few real niggas left so I guess we win by forfeit huh?
Chalk it up, 1 more for the bad guys mad I crept up in the building and I killed em
Pack to ya workers make it unfair work on ya block and I ain't even from their. Run where?
I'm a 9 eleven nigga fuck fear. Have faith in the prayer

[Hook: Big KRIT]

Ya its that round table talk
Godfather speech jewelry flashing
And toast glasses to the mash
And forever wanting mo
Neva wanting less the secret to success
Be the mother fucking best
The secret to success
Be the mother fucking best
The secret to success be the mother fucking best

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Ya They like Krizzle where the shit at? Kid at?
Uptown southern flow I heard them niggas fear that
My flow is so soulful I hope that you can clear that
If you looking for returnof4eva we the one that you should get at
Young Krizzle, Smoke DZA, cinemizzac, black rizzoc
Hip hop is bizzack, I ain't got time for niggas that trynna play me
Cuz I'm from Mississippi I won't big you like gravy
Theatrical timing; its some Martin Scorcese
Will you ever be no where close to where we are?
Maybe. I'm Sunday schoolin these niggas like I was Sadie
If you want the best of the best of the best, best pay me
Bitch! I'm live from the underground
It might sound cliche but it's going down
Don't be confused shorty this just how I talk
I'm a pimp by blood shorty DJ how I walk

[Hook: Big KRIT]

Ya its that round table talk
Godfather speech jewelry flashing
And toast glasses to the mash
And forever wanting mo
Neva wanting less the secret to success
Be the mother fucking best
The secret to success
Be the mother fucking best
The secret to success be the mother fucking best

[Verse 3: Smoke DZA]

Yeah, its the Russell Westbrook of the bars I'm beyond killing em
Y'all got no clue its going down nah
Young krizzle double 8 spine busted the game I'm nature boy rick
Johnny Bobby the brain
Ain't no stopping the reign this is forever ho
Get used to us the goose is up out of here
The competition is fucked
Word to my nigga spitta ain't nothing up but us
By any means necessary I don't need nice I need legendary
Longevity's the key and I won't stop going till I reach my peak
You try an get nice get your bread right
Cemetery raps; dead nice hahah
No pork on my fork
Food for thought its that round table talk
Mother fucker!

[Hook: Big KRIT]

Ya its that round table talk
Godfather speech jewelry flashing
And toast glasses to the mash
And forever wanting mo
Neva wanting less the secret to success
Be the mother fucking best
The secret to success
