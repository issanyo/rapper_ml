[Intro: Smoke DZA & Pete Rock]
This is dedicated to all them fuck ass lists you left me out
All them conversations 'bout New York
I wasn't mentioned, like I moved or something
KushedGod, bitch, the realest
Uh huh, Pete Rock, Smoke DZA
Right, soul brother number uno
Let's get it, homie
And you know
Right
Let's go, DZA

[Verse: Smoke DZA & Pete Rock]
In a perfect world
Kilos, gold ropes and
West coast link that fuck with flights to bring the smoke in
Bitch from the Ivory Coast is cool to bring the dope in
Serving niggas like it's '04, next to Copeland's on Broadway
More money, more ways, the more clickin', the more waitin'
Don't be annoying, hittin' my phone all day
They say you live and then you die, well nigga
I done lived a million times, dead every night
Shit this Henny got me nice, got to fall before you fly
First to test landin' then you expandin'
Kick in the door, let the next man in (Let the next man in)
(Let me hear that) Mom's crib
Saltfish, fresh bacon, some sweet plantains
Cheers to getting money, I'm Ted Danson
Nigga been focused since I said hi to
More shit to get high to
More slick bars I provide you
Fuck a crab that infiltrate, try to divide crews (I see you)
You say you balling but it's biddy though
You know it's fucked up when Sharkeisha get more hits than your video
Fuck a sadiddy ho
This that rap city flow, hit Flex
Let the city know, shit, by time you hear this
A nigga will be up on Arsenio
And I got many more
And many more (Many more, many more)

[Outro: Smoke DZA & Pete Rock]
