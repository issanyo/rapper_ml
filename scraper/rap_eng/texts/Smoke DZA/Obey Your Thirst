[Intro]
I’m home
Kush god, bitch
Rollin up a strong
Why?

[Verse 1:]
Bring me all the chicken heads from Colorado to Morocco
I D'em up like Ibaka, sippin slow with my partners
Boulders on my finger, watch look quite similar
This a cinema when I pull and enter the spot
It’s bright lights so I get through the joint
Take a trip to Anne Arbor, check my Michigan joint
Kick my feet like I live in a joint
All hail kush god
Gotta feel me, can’t see me, need braile
These niggas ain’t real, they all characters
Bottom line there’s no challengers to challenge us cuz
Old nigga, new nigga, don’t matter to us
Throw these whack niggas right under the bus
Big face, my nigga check the dial
They google the flow, retweet the style
Double cup, a little ice, a lot of loud
Easy on the ice, I don’t like it watered down

[Hook:]
Only time I drink Sprite it’s when it’s lean in it
Money so tall I could lean on it
If it ain’t low I ain’t seen in it
Rollin up and rollin up, I’m on the shim with it
Only purp, no dirt
Keep it cool little bro obey your thirst
Only purp, no dirt
Keep it cool little bro obey your thirst

[Verse 2:]
Where the man it’s temple area’s where I plan to be
Every day I’m livin somebody’s fantasy
Homie got greedy in the hood and saw the slammer be
Like he was ballin and got his contract in the scheme
Standardly spillin, I gotta keep it a trillion
Sometimes it’s best to start over, ain’t nothing wrong with rebuilding
My hustler spirit, indulging a day
Still they want me to stay chill but chill don’t pay the bills
Pray I fall off but that’ll never happen
Homie this cool shit is everlasting
No matter where I’m at it’s the block I mastered
Narcotic swap, sold large amounts of gwop
Hustling hard, trying to take it to the top
It’s always time to get money on my clock
It’s always time to get fly and go shop
When life gets you boiling hot I pour up a cup

[Hook x2:]
