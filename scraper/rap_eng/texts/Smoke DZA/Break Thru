[Chorus: Rook]
Break thru, break thru
Lately I been waiting on a break thru
Heard it make you stronger if it don't break you
But I, gotta make it happen we don't get a take 2
Going for the gusto
And you know I got the blunt rolled up
Baby c'mon smoke it with me
Why you acting like you over me?
Fuck what you heard I'm a boss for real
Doubting my might of cost you the deal
I ain't even gotta fuck with a pill
Kill the pain with the money my homies all in my will

[Verse 1: Rook]
Some things are better left unsaid
Certain situations should of left that bread
Watching a Bronx Tale, the best $20 that I ever spent
Sometimes people tell you things that they never meant
Guess its a sign of the times, I'm a lion with mine
Rappers just lie in they rhymes, I can't stand it
My respect I demand it
Me and Smoke rolling up get the money then we vanish
I remember my mother telling me don't believe everything that you see
My father told me the same thing, back then I ain't know what it mean
I can't be the one you call, I can't be the one you need
I'm sorry not right now I got a million places I gotta be
I'm looking for a...

[Chorus: Rook]
Break thru, break thru
Lately I been waiting on a break thru
Heard it make you stronger if it don't break you
But I, gotta make it happen we don't get a take 2
Going for the gusto
And you know I got the blunt rolled up
Baby c'mon smoke it with me
Why you acting like you over me?
Fuck what you heard I'm a boss for real
Doubting my might of cost you the deal
I ain't even gotta fuck with a pill
Kill the pain with the money my homies all in my will

[Verse 2: Smoke Dza]
I push the start button on life and watch the engine explode
Gotta appreciate the struggle because the winning is gold
Around snakes, pound cake, keep some Entenmann's though
Tried to park a nigga dreams hope my feelings got towed
Won't happen, disrespect God no yappin'
You decide what's "real nigga shit" I show action
No laughing matter, simple mathematics, attack for status
The only way to last be savage
Sheep gon' always be sheep, but I don't pardon the weak
I get money while you partied all week
Flying out while you going to sleep
Touching down while you waking up
You probably thought this all was a dream
But it is what it seems
George Kush, never end the regime
My cabinets a venomous team
Men of respect, men thats pristine
You still trying to figure what the rederick means, I mean

[Chorus: Rook]
Break thru, break thru
Lately I been waiting on a break thru
Heard it make you stronger if it don't break you
But I, gotta make it happen we don't get a take 2
Going for the gusto
And you know I got the blunt rolled up
Baby c'mon smoke it with me
Why you acting like you over me?
Fuck what you heard I'm a boss for real
Doubting my might of cost you the deal
I ain't even gotta fuck with a pill
Kill the pain with the money my homies all in my will
