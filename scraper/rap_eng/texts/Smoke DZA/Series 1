My name is AlistFame, I’m from Paterson NJ. When I was making that beat, there was a guitar laying in the studio, fender, I grab it, plugged it up. There was this really eary sound like sad chord. It’s the reason, it just drew me in to the whole beat. I completely locked into that whole chord, I laid it down, it wasn’t sad but very melancholy, it was weird, a weird feeling but it made me finish it using that sound

[Verse 2: DeLorean]
This is so unorthodox, let me try to sort this out, man I think I’m bugging out/ I hear my voices in a whisper, from a distance on this cloud and this loud/ got me feeling like eagle stand down on the ground/ they preying on the prayless, pray for them/ them bullets ain’t got a name on them then put a name on them/ any nigga say my shit then dig a grave for them/ close casket, private viewing we can arrange for them/ ain't nobody seeing this nigga/ he got it made for them/ dolly truck it, why the fuck you get in my lane for?/ huh, what the fuck you get in my lane for? Road rage rapping I’m out here yelling with strangers/ wusha, kupa, work on my anger/ nigga who fly/ you not/ this is a banger/ I just scooped Doc/ hoop dot/ two in the chamber/ I mean double barrel, them bitches crossing in angles/ let it fly

Oddly enough I was thinking Mobb Deep and stuff like that, it had like a Queens feel, like a Queens Rapper, it had me like thinking about a lot of sad stuff, so named the beat torn, so maybe somebody can speak about like that. (Prodigy in adlibs: Mobb Deep). It’s a hard beat, overall vibe, I wanted somebody to spit some real, real talk on there from inside (Prodigy in adlibs: NYC shit, the rapfest)

[Verse 3: Prodigy of Mobb Deep]
Yea ah yo I’m too G for the source, shit I’m too intelligent/ to believe anything you say, you just talking/ we out here everywhere, you missing in action, POR, President of Rap trapped in/ this life and we look forward never back/ yea I’m looking forward to my box cutter on your neck, ok respect to the niggas that got respect for me/ they shit is quit all right but it is not mobb deep. Fuck being diplomatic, you can kiss my ass/ savage recognize savage and you looking real fag/ you a gentleman, I’m extremely brash/ I’m way too abrasive you making me laugh/ Pussy we run through this money cause its nothing to make/ pussy who run NYC its not up for debate/ westuck our flag pole in the concrete we straight/ you follow us to the pearly gates/ Mobb Deep
