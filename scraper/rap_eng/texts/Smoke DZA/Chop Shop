Got one confssion, lyrical aggression is my obsession, Full oppression, I gain possession from concession, start a new depression, I'll face Satan, No debating, Never shaken, Make it blatant, Last year was a mistake, but calling me out is a mistake, drop a diss track like I am Drake, Take you down Kamikaze, too late to pull the breaks, eating 100$ steaks, ye Red wine so divine, Spit a street rhyme like Kyrie, I drop a dime, old girl still a dime, but I always lose change, the rap game I'll rearrange in my image, playin' these boys like a scrimmage, bout' to make the holy pilgrimage
(Chorus) Pull up on a block it's a chop shop, everywhere in the streets it's a chop shop, everywhere I go it's a chop shop, Pull up on a block it's a chop shop, everywhere in the streets it's a chop shop, everywhere I go it's a chop shop
You're a tenant, I'm in charge I'm the lieutenant, you've got no game, you play for the raptors, you Anthony Bennett, Retire my jersey, high up in the rafters, I'll tear off your skin, just to unnerve ya', cock back and serve ya', I want to be world renowned like Akon, innovative like baby-lon, people addicted to my lyrics like a girl in a hair salon, Under my command like a pawn, brain vs brawn, I love the smell of success, I give off the impression that I'm better than the rest, dont even have to stop to take some rest, I'll pass any test, No matter how much you detest, shrug it off like Kanye West, doing his Kanye best, to be Kayne blessed, I hope lord frees us, young yeezus, you can not defeat us, face us, or brace for us, main word hush, keep it quiet on the streets, But on the mic I gush, no smoke no kush, I'm lighting the game on fire, everyone pretending not to care, liar liar, pants on fire, I've got one buyer, one supplier, the rest of yall to tired, to get off ya'lls ass and follow your dreams, You'd rather sit back in a chair, and make some dank memez
(Chorus) Pull up on a block it's a chop shop, everywhere in the streets it's a chop shop, everywhere I go it's a chop shop, Pull up on a block it's a chop shop, everywhere in the streets it's a chop shop, everywhere I go it's a chop shop
Last verse always gotta make it count, everybody so obsessed on the bank accounts, always focused on the commas, and never the bars, until they got locked away in bars, and never got the chance to be a super star, Other peoples flows are sub par, they gettin' bogies, i take em down like a bogie, they actin' goofy, acting like yogi, roast em then eat em like perogies, never first never worst go hard on every verse, straight up B106
(Chorus) Pull up on a block it's a chop shop, everywhere in the streets it's a chop shop, everywhere I go it's a chop shop, Pull up on a block it's a chop shop, everywhere in the streets it's a chop shop, everywhere I go it's a chop shop
