[Verse: Yong Roddy]

One time for my haters cause they my motivation
Lick another shot for them niggas who ain't waitin'
Who gon' get it nigga I feel ya
A real nigga exit how he entered
For sleeping on the Jets I make them pussies pay interest
With the mic I'm a known killer
A next ball player slash ex-drug dealer
Who spit it how he live it, and mind on his scrilla
But this that takeover niggas better get familiar
Bitch better know her role trying to roll with us
Cause living in the Dirty South, shit get cold nigga
And I might be a lot of things but not no broke nigga
My bucket low like fuck it though, like I'm on a boat
Shorty give me brains fancy[?] where her hands go
And word to her toe she must have done this befo'
Lil' mama keep it G, and me I keep it dope

[Hook: Roddy]

And we demand respect, we the Jets
It's only a handful of real niggas left
Mother fuck them niggas I'm sending threats
Fucking with my set, that's like Russian Roulette
And it's free my nigga [?] he rep the same hood I rep
We got niggas in the pen who never heard out music yet
In our [?] pad your main bitch be our guest
Pre-rolled doobies on deck

[Verse: Smoke DZA]

Ex-drug dealer, nah I'm lying
I bust the seal before I even pulled up to the store
Back up a half a P before I hopped up in the booth
And after I get done a nigga trying to cop a Q
Fuck it, you know I make it do what it do
Living is real, paying the bills
Hustle like a player with limited skills
Leave the streets hurtin'
Big man put work in like Kendrick Perkins
The life I was birthed in
Just another bud off my family tree
You can catch me sweater with teddy[?] chasing the fetti
On the milk crate on the side of the deli
Kicking it, car in park bumping Jet Life tunes, your bitch in it
Rolling up for a nigga as I handle business
I'm a hustler, lyricist, real nigga
Most of these niggas be clitoris
