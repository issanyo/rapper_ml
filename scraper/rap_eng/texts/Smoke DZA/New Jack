[Reporter:]
Harlem specifically where the original gangster New Jack is standing by. I'd like to warn viewers up front that I'm sure this interview is going to be inappropriate in more ways then we can enlist in one hour. Viewer discretion is sincerely advised

(La musica de Harry Fraud)

[New Jack:]
I said 'you meet me in Harlem'
I said 'we ain't gonna do this in the studio'
I said 'we ain't gonna do this is a setting where it's safe'
I said 'you bring your ass to Harlem'
And I put up with a lot of bullshit, but it don't matter
Because I have established myself as the original gangster
Not the original prankster
I don't rap about it
I don't sing about it
This what I do
(Riiiiiggghhhtt)

[Verse 1]
I said wake up muthafuckas, it's for so long you could sleep
I'm like Freddy in your dreams appearing live up on yo street
They ki-ki-ki, ha ha ha, but it's so long they could play
Try to hold a nigga down but every doggy has its day
Killing em calm, tuck 'em, face down
You don't really wanna step in my playground
I-I-I'm a, I'm a class act, you looking at the real life Blade Brown
You acting like I won't abuse niggas, square ass lame Duncan Pinderhughes niggas
I can send a few triggers at ya door on some Calvin shit
Then barge through that muthafucka on some violence shit
So have it your way Nigga pick your poison
Shorty keep talking that ya ya you shit but bitch I'm way iller than ya boyfriend
Plus I make more money, you think he cool cause he ball over seas?
Right, shit I ball overseas too
I'm in the game he won't ever see the league truuuuuuue!

[New Jack:]
I said cause nigga I make money'
I put asses in seats
That's why I'm there (ya know what I mean)
That's why New Jack is where he is (ya know what I mean)
Because I put asses in seats

[Verse 2]
It's the highest in charge, you muthafuckas got fat while we starved
You need to hold your guard instead of gossiping and holding ball
Wo-wo-word to my word to my mother, cold as ice shit I need my own cover
The shit that I riddle should have me right in the middle
Cause some of these niggas ain't even did what I did on the come up
Sold out tours on the come up (one up)
Album in the stores 2 summers (one up)
Adam Vinatieri how I kick it (punter)
Underground king, Big Bunna (what up)
9/11 I'm alive man, the way a nigga ball shit I might need a Heisman
Nah! Fuck that I'mma hustle, I'mma need a gold Bill Russell
Right, and a few rings, king Raw papers filled with butane
R&B bitch with a cute thang, and a Jeffrey type nigga like "you rang"
Ha! and some OG, preferably from Oakland
I don't care if you's a mile away, you can smell what the Kushed God smoking
Riiiiiiiiight!

[New Jack:]
And I don't ask nobody to do nothin for me
Because I do what the fuck I wanna do (ya know what I mean)
If you don't like what I do
Turn the channel
Watch the fake shit
But this is New Jack
