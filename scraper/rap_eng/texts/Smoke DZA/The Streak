[Verse]
Closed casket, Paul Bearer bring the urn out
Killer with the flow, won't ever be burned out
Low to the flo', keep a stupendous piece
365 days straight, they won't end my streak
My closet's a graveyard, got endless flavors
In harlem im the mayor, made man, niggas owe a few favors
I gotta stay prayed up, wicked times only god can save us
I gotta keep it A+, there's too many fake fucks
Straight up, Hear the whispers when I pass by
Give one of you niggas a tombstone, in case you ready for your last ride
You try to get cute and it backfired, ain't that right
Your bitch ain't give you no act right, you think she curved you for last night
She use me as a pacifier, I stay in her throat man
She love me in her mouth, I call it the choke slam
And say hello to the deadman, say hello to the deadman
Took a zip to the face, fifth of henny to the head man
And say hello to the deadman, say hello to the deadman
Took a zip to the face, fifth of henny to the head man
Dead man, dead man
Dead man, dead man
Say hello to the dead man

[Sample of Paul Bearer]
You talk about your darkside
Let me welcome you to our darkside
There's a very fine line between your side and ours
But now it's time for you to step across
Into the darkside
