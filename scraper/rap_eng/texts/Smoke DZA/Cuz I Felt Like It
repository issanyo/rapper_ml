[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Righttttttt
My niggas don't play Draw Something, they draw hammers
Take shots, no cameras, no bandannas
But they grimy, loyalty to the block or it's 10/90
Ambush a nigga kindly and untimely
Niggas punani, tough until they reach the County
Around killers niggas turn into Mahatma Gandhi
I take the dour 'cross the border, get frisked by the Mounties
But like a magician the package disappear
Hit my homie Brendan, "Have some kush when I get there, mine's tucked away"
He like "You good?". I'm like "Fuckin' A"
"You fuckin' right, this bout to cure me from the flight"
"And got some goodies waitin' for me, shit I shipped 'em overnight"
I be on it, I got options to get right
And your bitch about to kiss the cock good night
Lames catch feelings, we catch flights
Downtown Harlem nigga and all my niggas nice

[Verse 2: Den10]
I'm on my way to Cali to see my bitch
Cause Harlem got hot and my G got pinched
I need a new connect, got to bring that flip
I'm a star in the hood, everywhere I went
Everywhere I've gone, everywhere I've been
If it ain't make dollars, it ain't make sense
Fresh D-Boy, a part-time pimp
Missy Elliot, is that your chick?
Up in my car? Boyfriend stare hard
I'm still a GangStar with my full clip
G-H-E-double T-O then
Ghetto moms, ghetto friends, I'm ghettoin'
Get money, I show it
Won't save, I blow it
Miss my first payment when I lease that Benz
Yea bitch I'm gutta gutta (naw nigga, you ghetto as motherfucka)

[Verse 3: Den10]
On my way to Texas, drivin' reckless
Sippin' Peach Ciroc, almost missed my exit
Watchin' for the cops, I ain't got no license
Ghetto like a motherfucka, peep my gesture
Tilted brim, heavy lean suggested
Lookin' for a lean that'll push this package
Half a brick of yay and a D-cup breastes
(Keep rapping, don't get lazy on me, keep going nigga)
Got the same shine that's in my necklace
Gotta live it up cause I ain't dead yet
I'm here, leave it up to them, nope I got it brah
Been too thin to the gangstas, they not as tough
I been tryna hide stuff, yea keep it moderate
My lil' lil' man keep the Tech in a holister
I don't really really wanna have to shoot ya' party up
Tell the DJ play my shit, keep it rockin'
