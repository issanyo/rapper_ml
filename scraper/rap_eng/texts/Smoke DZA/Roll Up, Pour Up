[Hook]
I wanna pour my drink, roll up my weed, lay the seats back cruise at a slow speed
I’m trying to find me a bitch lied up and jump fly
Grind make a couple of dollars just so I can get by
I wanna pour my drink, roll up my weed, lay the seats back cruise at a slow speed
I’m trying to find me a bitch lied up and jump fly
Trying to make a couple of dollars just so I can get by

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
I just wanna roll my joint, get a little chick to kick it
Only time I’m sipping drink it’s when Killa fix it
She be tasting like cool aid, fuck around, chuck a whole ounce and be sleep like 2 days
Don’t get twisted, I’m a stoner
Ain’t nothing like a strong marijuana aroma
Pure hemp papers, we smoke like grown ups
84 slaps doing donuts
H town, up to H world
You trying to roll with the winner circle, what you say girl?
You gonna be down and be down and no play girl
Little cutie could hit the doobie if she able
I’m saying, I’m just an uptown boy
Harlem nigga, steady hustling g like a nigga from broadway trying to sell you something
Still bullshitting babble on, I’m just trying to marathon with my nigga Kyleon

[Hook]
I wanna pour my drink, roll up my weed, lay the seats back cruise at a slow speed
I’m trying to find me a bitch lied up and jump fly
Trying to make a couple of dollars just so I can get by
I wanna pour my drink, roll up my weed, lay the seats back cruise at a slow speed
I’m trying to find me a bitch lied up and jump fly
Trying to make a couple of dollars just so I can get by

[Verse 2: Killa Kyleon]
Yes he stepped in the building nigga, it’s Killa and Dza nigga
Get a compass and gps look you gonna find some really nigga
I stay road in the … potter so call me the lizard nigga
And I’ma keep sipping drinks till I need a new liver, nigga
So I guess I’m slizzard nigga … my mind, don’t treat them chicks like a bad
Keep switching up like my time zone
My grand stroke, emo any rockets what I’m on
… straight to that tele teller I’m skipping that land loan
If it ain’t about no dollars then it ain’t too much we can talk about
My exes speak louder words you broke niggers talk a lot
While you blabla, … I’m running getting fool
Roll up and rolled up in … I’m griping …
I hit the hood on my paper chase no homo, my paper’s straight
Our money, you looking traded, that must been your paper lane
From Houston to Harlem whirl like they pay my bills do
And that’s on the first and plus the 50 with my bills deal

[Hook]
I wanna pour my drink, roll up my weed, lay the seats back cruise at a slow speed
I’m trying to find me a bitch lied up and jump fly
Trying to make a couple of dollars just so I can get by
I wanna pour my drink, roll up my weed, lay the seats back cruise at a slow speed
I’m trying to find me a bitch lied up and jump fly
Trying to make a couple of dollars just so I can get by
