[Hook]
You already know how the story go
Hope you on your grind, save all your dough
Uh, this is sour diesel audio
I'm on the strip like Miami or Memorial
Right, chasin' chicken
Kenny Powers, chasin' chicken
Kenny Powers, chasin' chicken
Kenny Powers, chasin' chicken

[Verse 1]
Right, fresh cut from buddy I'm lookin' handsome
A zip from Bubsie a health drink from Branson
Fresh threads like I came from the mansion
Old bucks my nigga, Terrel Brandon
Lampin', eyes closed I'm plantin'
My momma Guyanese you know she do the damn thing
Right, this is sour diesel audio
Bag it up, roll up my sleeves, let the Rolly show
I got the plug my little bruh I got the juice
So we cheesin' in the corner like we playin' with Ryu
Wanna be soldiers, we ain't lookin' for recruits
See y'all in the streets and y'all niggas hit the deuce
What it do silly wabbits
Twitter artists, silly rappers
Hah, I hear the chatter in the background
Don't make a Kushed God layeth the smack down

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Right, early bird get the worm
He has risen, time to burn
Like, how you make it cloudy on a sunny day?
Oh you don't know? Shit you niggas 'bout to learn today
Uh, I'm from Harlem nigga, money make
Devil want dour, stick and move like I'm Money May
Uh, I ain't into all the fun and games
Take your ass to Gamestop if you wanna play
Run to who? I ain't ever run to you
Shittin' on y'all the only time I'm number two
Turn your back on the real nigga, you fuckin' fools
Talk behind a nigga back, that's a sucker move
Thank God that I'm sucker free
I never acknowledge you niggas publicly
Uh, no more bro-broin' ya
Kick rocks, fuck-boy, nigga nice knowin' ya

[Hook x2]
