{Verse 1 Fresh}

They doubted
Motivation to be the greatest
I'm Plotting my innovation
I grinded instead of waiting
I'm flagrant

They don't give it
Then I'mma take it
More then music it's life
Shit I'm destined to do this
Rightttttt (Fresh & Smoke Dza)
Right
Shit I got it dza
I'm learning
I started off in the basement
Creating & now I'm earning
{Ha}
The hate ain't stop me
I'm buzzing so now they watch me
Told them I'm on my shit
It's no wonder I'm feeling cocky ha
& I'm so focused
Bars potent I'm flowing
It's lit
& like a candle
They waiting to see me blow it
(Ha)
Said ima get it
I spoke it & then I showed it
Working to be the best
It's a blessing kuz now they know it (haha)
And Like a Prophit
I predicted I'd Prophet
I'm Riding around my city
With bitches that need there pops
And
I'm Tryna get it
Told my niggas they wit it
The top is just like a bitch
And like ray j
I said I'd hit it

{Verse 2 Smoke Dza}

911 Boy
Polo Down I Stay Low
Hustlers on the squad
Killers on the pay roll
They out here Gaffing Nigga's
The consequence is Fatal
Niggas be out a line
They cut the lean with k row
No need to front kuz they know
Bitches give neck insano
She eat a Nigga up
Clean my pipe like Drano
They try to Fig out my angle
Stay out my lane though
Money and Fame Go
Hand and Hand
They do the tango
I'm on my own Flight
No connections needed
Perrier My Glass
Some Raw to roll my weed in
I'ma Top notch nigga
No less
In NY I'm the coldest
Gotta drag my cohones
Big homie nigga
KONY nigga
0 Cosigns
1 of the only niggas
They really can't see me
Big Dawg Dza
I don't mingle with these Preemies

{Chorus Sample}
All the Stars
They shine so bright
All the clouds
Make it bright
But when you smile
Ohhh how i feel so good
That I can Hardly wait to
