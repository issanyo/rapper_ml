[Intro]
(Skrt, skrt)

[Chorus]
On the set
Everything clean, catch a jet
In the set
Wearin' rare stones on the neck
In the set (set)
Give me my respect and a check and I'm set with it
Pull up with the bag and I'm flexin'

[Verse 1]
Aye what that nigga say
Chuckie braved up we freed up we read up
Before his first tour I was knowin' Justin Bieber
My partner need ten grand O'Casse need a Visa
We tie the loose knot so we out to Pommerania
Rain drop rainy and watch is titanium
Pickin' with who I'm hangin' with 'cause these niggas dangerous
[?] Get the Oscar
6' 1' nigga tryna fit in a Boxster
I had some fool niggas around I had to let 'em go
I knew 'em since Biology class, but bro you never know
Right when that economy crashed when I was gettin' on
And people in the poverty class, the ghetto stay awoke
No rest for the weary I'm serious
I ask Siri who the freshest nigga period
She said you knew before you stepped into the mirror
A Zeiss lens couldn't make the picture no clearer

[Pre-Chorus]
Seein' everything clean through the lens
We the dream team had to lean on the fence
Now I peep the scene from the seat of the Benz
What's the dealie Master C with the rims

[Chorus]
On the set
Everything clean, catch a jet
In the set
Wearin' rare stones on the neck
In the set (set)
Give me my respect and a check and I'm set with it
Pull up with the bag and I'm flexin'

[Verse 2]
You heard what he said Rocks we held out scale pounds is selled out
If it hit the mailbox then bring it down to Boldy house
I held the spot like I hit it on the dot
Add it to the pot and I stash it in my sock
Pass my man the jod and I'll catch another jab
My United Center niggas watched the Bulls beat the Cavs from the box
What I said is these little shorties hot
Coulda been the next LeBron but it's pills he gotta cop
And some softie got him off
Pass him a gold cross like Nas gave Lil Dog
Man I always had my pops so I share it with the block
That verse from One Love raised a lotta niggas up
Park benches of the projects
In that white ever Avirex
Put it 'round his neck told him we 'gon make a bet
You could sell this fool a check, man I put that on the set

[Pre-Chorus]
Seein' everything clean through the lens
We the dream team had to lean on the fence
Now I peep the scene from the seat of the Benz
What's the dealie Master C with the rims

[Chorus]
On the set
Everything clean, catch a jet
In the set
Wearin' rare stones on the neck
In the set (set)
Give me my respect and a check and I'm set with it
Pull up with the bag and I'm flexin'

[Verse 3]
Button up Burberry number 3 cement
Jewelry worth a 100 plus money fresh up out the mint
Everything mint condition when I step up out the Benz
Transparent Cartie lens with the root beer tint
Get caught with the strands on me that's a two year bit
Me, Rocks Tris and Shruddie we the toothpick clique
Nasir the big homie I'm the one he gave the crucifix
Fingernails dirty, nigga I be thumbin' through some shit
Runnin' through them icky woods in the hood movin' grits
Big bag full of chickens so Imma call 'em Bucharest
All of my youngins brag about is who could shoot the best
Sippin' on that yellow tussin' thinkin' it's some Mucinex
Night slappin' in the p-jects
Dingy white tee with the ring 'round my v-neck
Not a murder in my v soundin' like a T-Rex
From selling mink white works  and some  Kleenex

[Verse 4]
20 years since Big gone since then it's been a shit storm
I want the Benjis, fuck the bitcoin
Superman iceberg for Lil Shawn
Lay the foundation to build on
Toast to the real ones
Don P. bottles to drink responsibly
Feelin' like A.C. Slater in this low varsity
Keep them hypebeasts the fuck far from me
Kush god bitch I'm livin' in
Friendly cat when he hatin' he real polite
Probably pillow talk with the bitches I know your type
But dog I ain't the one to judge so it's aight
Pull up in the drop and take the top off at the light (skrt)
Checkpoint couldn't find the work wasn't their fault
Lost your whole flow 'cause your path was a airball
Holdin' no punches keepin' it real tall
On my way to Italy meetings with Gilmore

[Pre-Chorus]
Seein' everything clean through the lens
We the dream team had to lean on the fence
Now I peep the scene from the seat of the Benz
What's the dealie Master C with the rims

[Chorus]
On the set
Everything clean, catch a jet
In the set
Wearin' rare stones on the neck
In the set (set)
Give me my respect and a check and I'm set with it
Pull up with the bag and I'm flexin'
