(Intro)
Ugh
911 shit
Kush God bitch
Really
Smoke Dza nah mean
Ugh
Righhhhhhht

[Verse 1]
This that crazy sam parties at the Kennedy's center flow
That NY winter cold
That keil breast dinner rolls
Snack box from momma's, anybody can get it flow
And it don't matter what coast you from
How many niggas you've killed, how much dope you've slung
Niggas thinking they can hang, how much rope you brung?
Bitch, fuck your feelings like New York been soft
Since another cali nigga came and crushed the buildings
Niggas squares like Sicilians
Big William
Hop in the whip like fuck the ceiling', high
Day n' Nite on my Cudi shit
Go head and buddy up with who you buddies with
You niggas want none of this

[Hook x4]
New York, New York
Big city of dreams

[Verse 2]
I'm Abdullah with the butcher work, fucking flawless
Get my cookies from the growers way before the harvest
No matter where I'm at it's 9/11 shit regardless
My niggas razorblade tatting like thy Tuki Carter
And people trying to do blizz like he Tookie Williams
Shout out my family in the feds shaking up the building
This for my homies trying to step they grams up
This ain't for niggas wearing leather pants, bruh
They arguing about who's real
Bunch of niggas dressing like Dru Hill, dude chill
Niggas wear spray on beards
Time to bring that real shit back that you feel

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]
I'm a swag rapper's worst nightmare
Still at your momma's house and you going to stay your ass right there
[dud trying to get a buzz gone take you lightyears
Bud you know I got the plug, could take a flight there
Everybody want to dictate, dick taste some same shit
Fuck your opinion and your lame list
It's a world outside the city and I'm doing my numbers
Made chicken all 93 nights of the summer
Sold out shows in Sidney
20 cities with Wiz
About 20k people a night
Making noise for the camp
Motherfuckers here to ride
In the roof blowing lead
And everywhere I go them niggas know where I live

[Hook x4]
