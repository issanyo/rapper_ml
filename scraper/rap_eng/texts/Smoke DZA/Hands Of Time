[Intro]
Yeah
If I could turn back the hands of time I'd probably

[Verse 1]
If I could turn back the hands of time I'd probably
Spark a few blunts and reason with Bob Marley
Getting wild stoned with Pete we sipping ?
Curse my girl out tomorrow I'm sorry
We do it Chris Farley
Red cams on dollies
Capture this moment of life on chronnie
Stress type drown me shout to growers that supply me
Amsterdam great area you can find me
On that Ghost OG I'm looking Ghandi
Take a bong rip take a sip of Dasani uh
Warm cookies from insomnia
Niggas blatantly steal my swag try to round me up
My time is now your time is up
Sat with Spike Lee had a hour lunch
Once the movie shit go that's the power punch
Knockin' niggas out like this Sour bruh

[Hook]
If I could turn back the hands of time I'd probably
Spark a few blunts and reason with Bob Marley
Getting wild stoned with Pete we sipping ?
Curse my girl out tomorrow I'm sorry
Tomorrow I'm sorry
If I could turn back the hands of time I'd probably
Spark a few blunts and reason with Bob Marley

[Verse 2]
Hail Mary's Our Father's and such
They paper planing but I rolled up a dutch
Came through in the clutch
? vibes ain't no reason to fuss
Up in Copenhagen hashed out cheesing the stuff
Take me back smoking with Troy
Teens with peach fuzz
Twisting ? Phillies with them pooled every nugs
Seven third from my Autobahn plug
All around buzz I get all around love
Bring that good energy
Ice cups Hennessy
Snack box from Kennedy's
Steaming that's a penalty
Says the nigga who don't pass at all
Roach clip ashed ?
Burn another one and laugh it off
Break weed on a summons another onion
It's the 2nd coming a hundred pounds and run it
Got a nigga wrapped up
Smoking joints with Steven Adler
Paradise City like the gas cuz

[Hook]
If I could turn back the hands of time I'd probably
Spark a few blunts and reason with Bob Marley
Getting wild stoned with Pete we sipping ?
Curse my girl out tomorrow I'm sorry
Tomorrow I'm sorry
If I could turn back the hands of time I'd probably
Spark a few blunts and reason with Bob Marley
