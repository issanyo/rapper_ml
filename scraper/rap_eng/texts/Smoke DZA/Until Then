[Intro: Smokey from FRIDAY]
Man, ain't nothing wrong with smoking weed. Weed is from the Earth. God put this here for me and you. Now take a hit. Man, stimulate your mind

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Right
Facts remain, attack ya lanes
Bastard's lame, yappin' with a half a brain
Master strain, just rolled a half of dank
Half insane, nah we ain't rap the same
Rapid flames, my catalog, cash it brings
On the road doing rapper things, nigga
I twist Backwoods, smoke Dutch Masters and shit
And cross the atlas, I be on some Actavis shit
They ignore it but they know what it is
Shout out my peeps on chemo and MS smokin' a liff
For the people smokin' and stressin' I know how you feel
Embrace this shit, no reality's real, really
It all sounds silly but, the world's so chilly
And society don't care how you feel, really
Kush God cares, if don't nobody else care
It's all love, take the hate and share it elsewhere

[Hook]
Now I'ma be nice until nice come back
Until then, nigga, light this back, be easy
Now I'ma be nice until nice come back
Until then, nigga, light this back, uh

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Test the tides, I do this here for exercise
Extra high, like you ain't recognize
Next in line, sober thought I'm vexed from minds
Rectify, the devil's tryna invest my mind
On deck tryna wreck my shine
Really, I mind mine, really but it's a fine line
They try and kill me, my vibe like Mike when Vito got hit
Bad bitches rollin' up, the gazebo is lit
Face the blunt, I be Debo-ing shit, "What blunt?"
Shoot the bird down from the sky like Duck Hunt
You lookin' sus son, how these niggas dressin out the cloth that I'm cut from
But to each is own my nigga
Keep hustlin', streets buggin', real niggas dyin', fake niggas still lyin'
It's a viscous cycle science
Busy tryna make sense of it
Realize the turkey bad I'm at an end of it

[Hook]
Now I'ma be nice until nice come back
Until then, nigga, light this back, be easy
Now I'ma be nice until nice come back
Until then, nigga, light this back, uh

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Well God's witness, I got bitches like cross fitness
My success may be a bit offensive
But my brain had been cloudy since some things changed around me
So polite but then at night I'm tryna get this rage up out me
I'm a power ranger proudly, trail blazin' in an Audi
I'll be damned when they see him go by
But fuck whoever said the species Malcolm don't fly
I ghostride my own mind, I'll be there in no time
I live and died at least three or four times before
Had my funeral so drop the top and suicide the coffin doors
I'm reincarnated, back to the drawing board
Back to  start of the board game please restart the score
Shit, start a war you softer than the carpet floor
Fuckin' with a carnivore, heart as frozen as the Arctic ocean, bring a shark to shore
Dick in her jaws, I give her wood like a carpenter
Jesus and his modern form, modern form

[Hook]
Now I'ma be nice until nice come back
Until then nigga light this back, be easy
Now I'ma be nice until nice come back
Until then nigga light this back, be easy

[Outro: Peter Rosenberg]
New York city make some noise for yourselves
Make some noise put them jets up
Let me see some jets up for my departure real fast
We gon' go the same way we came
Take me out the right way
