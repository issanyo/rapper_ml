[Chorus]
Yo I think I need me some medicine
I'm getting sick of these fake niggas
I'd rather not conversate with you
I don't got nothing to say to you
Even if we was related I feel like I'll never relate to you
Doctor gon' give me the medicine I'm getting sick of these fake niggas
Yea, medicine, yea medicine
Yea, medicine, yea medicine
Yea, medicine, yea medicine
Yea, medicine, yea medicine

[Verse 1]
I gots to find me the cure, I'm starting to get sick of them more
Pardon my back while that full-length just drag on the floor
I wore this shit right out the store
Ain't no better feeling, sick with flow I need Penicilin
This that raw shit that Medellin
Been had your hoe with her legs to ceilings
Show the king how that neck be feeling, ah
Snatch my soul shit Elvis left the building
Niggas mad cause they less appealing
Hustler since my first rap
I ain't giving work back Imma work that (Right)
Call him out, why, they ain't worth that (Right)
He ain't really mean it he was off that white
I ain't never even got to floss no ice
I win at life so you lost that fight (Riiight)
Already, three bad bitches took a tiger bone shot
In 'em, already, spread 'em out different floors in the telly (wooh)
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Imagine how my wrist feel
Better think twice sit still
Ungrip big pistol hit you make your piss spill

[Chorus]
Yo I think I need me some medicine
I'm getting sick of these fake niggas
I'd rather not conversate with you
I don't got nothing to say to you
Even if we was related I feel like I'll never relate to you
Doctor gon' give me the medicine I'm getting sick of these fake niggas
Yea, medicine, yea medicine
Yea, medicine, yea medicine
Yea, medicine, yea medicine
Yea, medicine, yea medicine

[Verse 2]
Right
I got to find me the remedy most of these niggas be frenemies
Something be wrong with them mentally just here to suck up the energy
No more benefitting of my shit I got better vision
And so far thats my best decision dog I ain't come from nepotism
Where I'm from only death or prison ah
Curve you, gaff your only dude was trendin'
Your own bread up, that's independent
S or F yea big fat, next one its the get back
Player haters never prosper
Oscar ribeye with the lobster
Little nigga fix your posture
Keep me something looking proper
Resurrect my whole roster
Already, dropped Don't Smoke Rock
Came back to the block like, I'm all ready
Next move put the world on a levy, right
A boss supposed to teach his team to fish
A few done jumped the gun and seen the cliff
Computer beef for what my G, that's riff
A bunch of frauds with faker jewelery kits

[Chorus]
Yo I think I need me some medicine
I'm getting sick of these fake niggas
I'd rather not conversate with you
I don't got nothing to say to you
Even if we was related I feel like I'll never relate to you
Doctor gon' give me the medicine I'm getting sick of these fake niggas
Yea, medicine, yea medicine
Yea, medicine, yea medicine
Yea, medicine, yea medicine
Yea, medicine, yea medicine
