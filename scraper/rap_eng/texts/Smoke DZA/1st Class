[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Welcome to where the players feast
Some will pay to see, never go but pray to be
Exit row on the low, bargaining the chains they seek
Complaining to me about the needs, that they been on for weeks
Is you sucking or you fucking well, cause this ain't just a glass house
30,000 feet in the air, I'd hate to kick yo ass out
Fly until we pass out, something you should savor
Because if we ain't the best then it's clear that we the greatest
Welcome to-

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Dazzled by the JETS
Rozay by the case, why don't you pour a glass?
Access ain't for everybody, let me see your boarding pass
Your amongst kings, fly as fly talk, honor class
Shorty wanna chill, her man just tripping for an autograph
Fuck her with this leg room, middle seat is for the suckers
Turbulence up in they flow, hakey as a motherfucker
On this private jet, while y'all stuck on that commercial flight
Nonstop to the top, enjoying life

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sant]
Mile high, now just remember I'm the president
Can you dig it if not, I suggest you pay the plane a visit
Gone and upgrade at the last minute, no way you sitting next to me
You in row "H" ho, you know sitting behind the "G's"
Im such a sight to see so close your eyes
A pimp's wingspan implies that I was going to fly
Get ya mind right bitch you fucking with a star
This ain't the captain speaking but she listen when I call

[Bridge: Big KRIT]
Hurry up, please don't miss your flight
We'll touch down and take off the same night
Just you and me, overseas
We can solve the world with a sight to see
In first class
