[Verse: Smoke DZA]
If you ain't a wrestling fan this ain't for you
You wanna hear some other shit
Then check out my other shit
Uh
Its true, its true
If you condone sucker shit
Then you is too
Got cashed out and blew it too
My bad did some bird shit the crew is cruel
Fuck it that's music grooves
Down playing DZA that's a foolish move
Its League of Legends you know who is who
Its the cyborg, new and proved
Uh
Olympic gold medalist
D's came, I hid the work in the crevices
My man out west in (?)
Every weekend the numbers so generous
Tripled up, this is not a re-up
Enough to break down, hit my posse up
Put it together in your face, my hibachi clutch
I won't let 'em lock me up

[Outro: (?)]
Ladies and gentlemen
I might as well be the poster boy for ruthless aggression
Oh its true
As king of the ring
I made the immortal Hulk Hogan tap out
Last week on Smackdown
I beat The Undertaker one, two, three
Right in the middle of this ring
And yet no matter how much I accomplish
I still have to deal with the fact
That you people are unappreciative of my greatness
