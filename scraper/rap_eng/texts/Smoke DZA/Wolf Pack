[Verse]
Riiight
The RFC wolf pack's in here
Uh, I'll throw my H in the air
Uh, I'll fuck around and end your career
Only seen competition when I'm looking in the mirror
Uh, sippin' sangria
Phone's like some icy veneers
Niggas don't wanna shoot the field
We jump niggas anyway, my niggas don't care
Jackknife like Daddy Cool
All the way turnt up attributes
Run around like Radicals
Mark through your spot uninvited like Animals
Gold on my strap
Ambush you, RFC on your back
Uh, fuckboys get crucified
Survey says one more for the cool guys
Uh, and the survey says
One more for the cool guys
One more for the cool guys
You can never be too fly
One more for the cool guys
One more for the cool guys
One more for the cool guys
You can never be too fly
One more for the cool guys
