[Verse 1: Curtis Williams]
Look, I'm tryna cheat my way to heaven
All the wrong I did, I'm still tryna' count my blessings
These niggas absent to the school of hard
Knocks on the door got me paranoid
Tryna' make the rent, but still a nigga unemployed
Everyday, another dollar, I'm hopin'
They can't say I ain't 'bout it
Look at my eyes and focus, I bet you'll see the realest
Was a rebel, could've been a dealer
Grab a dutch, bit the middle, break it down and fill it
With the stickiest I ever smoked
Tryna' plant a couple seeds a [?] watch 'em grow
And I ain't claim to be perfect, but this [?] rap
Cause when you hear it, make you wanna get a stack
But it all ain't 'bout revenue, just what they want us to think
Still dodgin' night terrors when I sleep
Tryna' clear my mind up so I can dream
Spread my wings, jump in the air and be free
They goin' ride when it's time to ride
Split it up, that's the difference between you and I
When I'm chillin' roll a blunt and get stupid high
All feet on the ground, my head to the sky

[Hook: Curtis Williams - 2x]
This ain't the life that I chose, but I live it
When that money come in, you better split it
You gotta stay elevated and get lifted
I'm probably trippin' right now, but I ain't trippin'

[Red]
[?]
Comin' up, speed bound
Heavy thoughts, semi rounds
Several shots of Henny brown
Astral plane, [?] clouds
Chasing papers, rainin' cloud

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
I came into this muh'fucka' 20 pounds strong
But nah this ain't one of them songs
Hustle from strugglin' to do somethin' nice for my moms'
Tryna' right all my wrongs, [?]
Watchin' friends get it on, on some dummy shit
Niggas let the bitches seperate, [?] more the money did
Either or, [?] the block, [?] feeds us all
And why nigga, but my heart so cold like I'm from East Detroit
How much longer? My family ask
Wonderin' how my sanity last, no rebutal, just hustle
The drug game done got a fantasy draft
Niggas sellin' that fantasy gaff
Seeing is believing, or maybe not
Separate the real from the window seal
Authentic shit

[Hook: Curtis Williams - 2x]
This ain't the life that I chose, but I live it
When that money come in, you better split it
You gotta stay elevated and get lifted
I'm probably trippin' right now, but I ain't trippin'
