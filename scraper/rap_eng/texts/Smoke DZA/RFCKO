[Hook: Sample]
“I have voices in my head
They count to me, they understand
They talk to me”

[Intro]
DZA
3rd
I’m at you motherfuckers annually
Every Wrestlemania’s clockwork, it don’t stop
I’m the illest nigga doing this shit

[Verse 1]
Feel the wrath of the Viper
Puncake the competition, clean them right up
Hide up, go fuck your whole night up
Car talking to me like it’s night right up, yeah
Hip hop stray, stalking my prey
RKO from anywhere anytime of the day
Witness the evolution, get down and stay down’s the resolution
Legacy, one of the best to do it
Got a chip on my shoulder, I might test your movement
Orton, stomping your CD, I’m like “fuck your music”
You’re a peon, uppercut everyone that’s moving
Sneaky voice in my head that just keep me ruthless

[Hook]

[Smoke DZA]
Really
Real shit

[Verse 2]
Enforcer, double cross ya, I torch ya
Off ya, torch ya, torture
Toss ya like a flying saucer
[?] what you talking ‘bout, what you got to offer
Drunk, cursing the rest, it must be the Hennessey
I don’t trust a motherfucker, everybody enemies
Hey, make and connect and rearrange identities
Legend killer, taking more dinosaurs right out their misery
Wooh, The face of the company
Cashed in money in the bank, won comfortably
I’ma find you first, you ain’t got to come for me
Ringside, 3 on you marks, RFC

[Hook]

[Smoke DZA]
See what you made me do

[Samples]
“For those of you who don’t know me, please allow me to introduce myself. I’m Randy Orton.”
“RKO. Orton strikes. The Apex Predator strikes [?]. There’s chaos at ringside. Orton can’t be stopped. The Apex Predator all over [?].”
“…which is why I’m here right now to tell the authority, to tell the world that I’m just now getting started.”
