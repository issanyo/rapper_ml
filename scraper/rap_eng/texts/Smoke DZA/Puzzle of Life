[Intro:]
Yea
I’m just picking up the pieces
Yea, right

[Verse 1:]
I’m stuck in my ways
I guess it is what it is
I never change, well according to hours I always be this passive mothafucka
Certain extent I think they right
Saying fuck it help me get through alot of nights
Extensive mind fuckery
My conscience like, how long you want to be number three
Chanel like how long I’m gon be number two
You put music over your family
And you gon lose us too
You know I love you like Chinese food
I’m gon cool out in a few
Stick with me grindin through
Son of Joseph and Faith Guyanese island dude
They got their US citizenship in '92
Early '84 came your boy
Dope baby, little bundle of joy
I fulfilled they plan
And turn into the man I am

[Chorus:]
I’m just picking up the pieces
I’m just picking up the pieces
The puzzle of life

[Verse 2:]
I only got into weed cause I had to sell it
Tunnel vision on winning they call it selfish
Like who am I to better myself
Good dude look out always willin' to help
Though mothafuckas take advantage
Back door on a low slander
Pillow chat with them bitches and talk your man up
But I ain’t trippin though it’s ok
You know I mastered the art of the Keyser Söze
Smart niggas play dumb
A dumb nigga can’t play smart
No matter how hard they try they look retarded
Anyhow don’t take the bait
And be another whatchamacallit
My haters be on it, like damn nigga
You ain’t pop, nigga you still rap
I’m like damn you still broke and you still sell crack
You ain’t graduate to coke yet
Cop a brick kingpin
Either that or muzzle it

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3:]
Give a hundred to everything
Don’t expect hundred back
When I had work I gave away plenty hundred packs
Shoe was on the other foot wouldn’t see none of that
But I never turn my back on where I grew up at
Shout out my 911 niggas
Shit ain’t change until it’s my day
Keep sipping them gallons of Henny for me on Fridays
I know I been off the spot
But remember niggas the plan is to get off the block
Get out the hood
Own some spots
But don’t trip I’mma make us hot
'Til then believe in you like you believe in me
We can get richer as family and split it equally DZA
