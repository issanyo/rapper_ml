La Musica de Harry Fraud
Riiiiiight

[Verse 1:]
Spent off like the ODB
Trench like like I got the toast on me
Hear them niggas talking they can choke on these
Clean them fuckers up I got O.C.D
Shots for all you niggas/ I keep dumping
Strays if you nosey; tryina see something
You characters, you could keep fronting
Poppin you little niggas like cheap condoms
Get it cracking I'm an '84 baby
119 raised me fuck up your mind crazy
Waiting for the offer put some milli's up
Cause you know I'm the coolest cat in the cafeteria - DZA
[Christopher Walken as Uncle Mike:]
You watch those nature documentaries on the cable? (Yeah)
You see the one about lions? (Yeah)
You Got this lion. He's the king of the jungle. Huge mane, out to here. He's laying down under a tree, in the middle of Africa. He's so big. He's so hot. He doesn't want to move

[Verse 2:]
Uuuuh
I came from nothing to something
Work hard for my spot and I ain't budging for nothing
I made it pop when they was thinking I wasn't
So if I ain't that nigga, shit, these niggas is bugging
I don't hate; I multiply the figures
I inspire niggas, go head, get higher nigga
Do your thing, I ain't got time to meddle
We ain't do it first but we took it to another level [Uuuuuh]
Young niggas getting rich off Rap
But they ain't getting booked because them niggas is whack
A couple lions in the jungle full of mad suckas
Kush God: Get ready for the last supper
[Christopher Walken as Uncle Mike part 2:]
Now, the other animals,they notice this...and they start to move in; the jackals, Hyenas. They're barking at him, laughing at him. They nip his toes and eat the food that's in his domain. They do this...then they get closer and closer bolder and and bolder, till one day...that lion gets up and tears the shit out of everybody...runs like the wind, eats everything in his path.Cause every once in a while, the lion has to show the jackals...who he is
It's too late to be scared
