[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Coming down, sittin' clean, mixin' that Promethazine

[Verse 1: A$AP Twelvyy]
It's that ASAP
Gimme that beat, no take backs
Flow so hard I state facts
These real slugs, y'all 8-track
That's fool's gold, I’m two, four
Yellow and purp, I move slow
Stacking all my cool dough
Teacher need that too, though
I'm just copping sneakers
And a couple heaters
Loaded up on ammo
Dumping all these features
Fucking with me? Nah, my man
It’s clear to see you high my man
Ain't no system, try my man
Then they wonder why, my man
Moving like we moving, rising like we rising
ASAP Worldwide, global enterprising (huh)
Don’t that sound good, corporate but I'm wild hood
Coming from a wild hood now just his style (Huh)
Ricky always with us, sip the 'zona
Flacko put me on it, now the hoes won't get up off it
That's that pimp shit, never on no symp' shit
Shorty here now, best believe that's my tense bitch

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
I'm a weirdo
Molly in the pocket of my pea coat
Wresting a P-bo have three hoes
Got coke so we about to speed boat
I got trees anD O's
Step brother shit got boats and hoes
Boats and soda, rolling up the doja
White boys grew up the Pacific Coast
I thought I told ya so, I got tons of hoes
So when I lick lick lick lick on that bitch friend
Take the dick out the pussy, put it in the throat
Jiggas can’t say no to James
I done popped about 2 beans
Spillin' purple on the Moncler
Splitting swishers, blunts in the air
With my nigga, Smoke DZA
Now these hoes wanna know a nigga
Cause when I'm on the east, I fuck with Ruff
On the west, my drink is gruff
Fuck my dog, fuck my peso
Suck my dick ho cause I say so
Now she all up on my jock
Never made love but I fuck a lot
Taking shots of that tiger balm
Jeremy Scott, tiger on
Fixing a blunt at the blunt fitting dope
Now she talking about she wants the tiger balm
And my teeth fucked up but nigga I got hella hot hoes
I'm that Detroit mothafucker with the rudest flow

[Hook: A$AP Rocky & (Smoke DZA)]
I'm sittin' high, I'm tippin' slow
I'm gettin' high, but I'm sippin' slow
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes
I'm that Harlem mothafucka with that mellow flow
Coming down, sittin' clean, mixin' that Promethazine (Uh)
Coming down, sittin' clean, mixin' that Promethazine (Uh)
Coming down, sittin' clean, mixin' that Promethazine (Uh)
Coming down, sittin' clean, mixin' that Promethazine
(White! Purple, we loco! Purple, we loco!
On purple, we loco! Purple, we loco!)

[Verse 3: Killa Kyleon]
I’m too throwed
Two white cups, my shit filled
Drunk, high, pop Vic or X
Drink got me on lean like my 5th wheel
Candy painted sitting on them pokers
Make a barber disappear like hocus pocus
David Blaine, I take your picture
And never eat no dick like fried okra
ASAP my jewelry rocking
My watch, my chain, last name’s Stallone
King of the underground like Kevin Bun
Y’all freshman niggas better watch the throne
Money calling, gotta watch the phone
A nigga on his grind can’t miss shit
I’m bad to the bone like hoes clothes
AKA I’m a misfit
Y’all broke ass niggas just get rich
While I get rich my flow loco
It's so loco
I got the game in the jump, seen the show coat, del loco
Stupid bread, retarded money
As that Chevy my short bus
Smoking loud, you gotta cough it up
Another beat dead, getting chopped up
Part fidel, screwed face
I’m so H-Town like Scoob‘s tapes
Counting money, y’all flick the conch
I’ll hold a dead nigga so two faced (yeah)
Kush garden
There’s a killa, I lean and dream
My cups double, my blunts rolled
And I'm shaking these haters like Hakeem the Dream

[Verse 4: Freeway]
That shit crazy I’ve been lock
Since niggas been living in they moms’ house
Had ye, had nicks, had dimes out
While y’all was still playing in your snow clothes
Yo new chick? My old ho
Yo new style? My old clothes
These niggas ain't got no clothes
Plus they be kicking it with po-po
I’m realer toward the dealer
Need that pen of Mary Urkle
Got a real line, got a trap line
Got Google voice numbers on both phones
I’m a globe trotting nigga that hold chrome
Fireman gotta ladder that chromo
No sprite, sip the purple straight
R-A-N-A real ass niggas that don’t blow
Mommy give me chocha
Papi know I’m loco
I see him, and cop two
Then he throw me popas
Betty Crocker cakes I move
A lotta come in place your order
Move that king, simply cause we able to
And proper told the chopper (haha)

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Smoke DZA]
Why? I’m a loco, nigga straight loco
First time out I warned y'all
Now I’m bout to go postal
First let me get to the pro tools
Fucking real low nigga, old school
This time I brought my folks through
Harlem niggas show love like I’m supposed to (huh?)
I got some bud in the cut
Rolling through the sink with some mud in my cup
Pour me an eighth, got me all stuffed
My nigga low from Meridian know what’s up
One time for my N.O. niggas
My Texas niggas, some reckless niggas
Double cup for breakfast niggas
All day no, effort niggas
I'm gettin' high, I'm sippin' slow
And all this tour money, I'mma get some more
Aight, bring it to the hood, get a heavy flow
You know us Harlem mothafuckas like to hustle though
I need the bread and the butter
Might be a hit, wouldn’t it be nice if I fooled ya
One time for the third and my homeboy Scudda
Better watch yo mouth til I get this shooter
I'm a loco, loco, you shook nigga
Keep yo head down, don’t look nigga
Better watch out for the hook

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
