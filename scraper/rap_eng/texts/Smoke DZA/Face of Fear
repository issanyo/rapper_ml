[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Really though
Smoke DZA, 183rd shit
Right

[Verse 1]
Face of fear, you know we ain't playing fair
Blow the candles out the lights
Come on dead bones, he appears
Never seen anything like it
Floral shirt bucket affair
Eating pepper pot in Georgetown
Guyana, got acres there
Hold up chill
Look at my wrists and just chill
Look at my bitch she just chill
Look at my status and look at that shit that I built
Dog I got no time to chill
Don't fear the army led by the sheep
Fear the sheep of the army led by the wolf
Master of the tug of war
Getchu out of here quick, got a lot of pull
Smoked a half a kil
Got the high and the wrath thats feel
See stars and daffodils
Meet my sister Abigail
I ran out of options
You talking that bullshit my (?) start popping
You cannot get low everywhere we be rocking
We really pop up and when everyone watching we (embarass niggas)
Don't play with me I'm not the average nigga
Push me with that garbage nigga
'Fore we left you how we left the last bitch nigga
Its all iron fists
Man I took all kinds of risks
Running through on a tyrant tip
And I just killed (?) shit

[Face of Fear]
(?) that I'm always dreaming of
And in the darkness of these dreams
I start seeing things
I see the world not for what it is
But for what it should be
I see a world laid barren to the virus that infects it
I see cities burning
I see governments crumbling
All of his beautiful creations laid to ruin
(Laughter)
It is such a beauty in chaos
Is there not
I am Bray Wyatt
The new Face of Fear
