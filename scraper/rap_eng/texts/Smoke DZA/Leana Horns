[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Twist Backwoods and blow Dutchies, smoke luxury
Nigga flow been ugly, since [?]
Niggas can't fuck with me, damn near made Rugby
Backtrack if your memory's fuzzy
Hate it or love me, I'm hot, rollin' back the [?]
He pass the pot, smoke grass a lot
Seen good energy, good vibes and
Whether in the hood or on a good island
Everybody raps, everybody wilin'
Smooth roads never made good drivers
Clear skies never made good pilots
Smoke DZA, nigga, only one and I'm him
Big nigga with the Stans on
KushedGodzilla, crush everything my hand's on
Pillow talkin', give that nigga some tampons
This real shit, real for 'em

[Verse 2]
Tax free
Dark drink, a [?] and Jack D
Johnny Walker, only sippin' if it's Blue Label
All my niggas is toastin', we at the cool table
Out of town rates
Music or the drugs, you know I'm around bass
Templates, no I do those cars
The black Jeep mean but the 2 door hard
Still sellin' all this [?], God
I just caught a flight, had to serve Bruno Mars
I stay clean
Sick of [?] some shades, I'm James Dean
If I'm eatin', we eatin', the same team
I got chinky eyed bitches that model from Beijing
Drug dealer, I was born that
Stay around keys and drums, now where my horns at?

[Verse 3]
Cohiba in my ash tray
Ridin' shotgun is my Cuban
She only here on the visa though
I told her to tell the feds she a student
It's only right cause she give me brain
She love a fly nigga so I dress plain
I could fuck around and fly into the towers
Started off on 50 cent, now I got power
Now I got powder, heron and sour
Plus the MAC-11 for these mothafuckin' cowards
Young shortstop, look they're runnin' to the base
If you fuck my money up you get a gun up in your face
The beat knockin', streets watchin'
And my block forever hot, ain't no heat droppin'
It's get money or die, ain't no three options
You're bitch'll get my niggas off, she like 3 cock, Lins Lo
