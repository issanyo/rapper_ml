[Verse 1]
Pro Cut Jerseys, destressed denims
Gold AP's with gats in 'em
Blow big L's, discuss winnin'
PR text me, let's kill 'em (Let's kill em!)
Right, indeed we shall
For so long politics could keep me down
On a 9-5 heading to the bacon
Make sure Slick got the cameras case they try Sandra Bland the situation
Young black nigga with bread
Gotta keep my feet to the ground 'cuz this rap shit can get to your head
Gotta clean the bong, too much res
Niggas drugged up, too much meds
Last day surreal, niggas tryna' do my best
Time and time I gotta prove my strength
Food for thought let you digest
For the hustlers and all minds alike
Drop gems on 'em like a failed diamond heist

[Hook]
Hop off planes, get change like it's the dope game
Before the rap shit came I had gold chains
Nigga we all got drugs, so what's yo thing?
We ain't the same, I'm hustlin' for my last name
We ain't the same, I'm hustlin' for my last name
We ain't the same, I'm hustlin' for my last name

[Verse 2]
Nigga you're broke what's your excuse?
The highest weed infused
Making every moment meaningful
Your hustle is minuscule
You're a gunk nigga, you been a fool
Fake jewels, you know you can't wear them shits in the pool
Fools Gold, a A-Trak special
Nigga I'm way past the A-class level
Live under a rock you gotta lay pass, I'm way past settled
Take a seat, have several
Put you in your place
Who better to?
Stay off my genitals
Get from 'round me with the clown biz'
Clown niggas, marry clown bitches, have clown kids
They all in the circus
I don't care about none of your Jordans or none of your Burtons
Count now, how many rappers, and how many working
I'm up the ladder
I'm to the bags with a bell boy status, you heard?
I ain't worried about a thing
You can duplicate the crown but you could never be the king

[Hook]
Hop off planes, get change like it's the dope game
Before the rap shit came I had gold chains
Nigga we all got drugs, so what's yo thing?
We ain't the same, I'm hustlin' for my last name
We ain't the same, I'm hustlin' for my last name
We ain't the same, I'm hustlin' for my last name
