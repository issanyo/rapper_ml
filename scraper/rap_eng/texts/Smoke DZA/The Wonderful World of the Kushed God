[Verse 1]
A round of applause
Second album in store, fresh off tour, and Im back at y'all
Rolling Stoned, I hope you can hold your own, consistantly do this on, and on
Harlem's own. Certified, I ain't a new jack that just started coming outside
I been roastin, battles on 2 fifth, when Mart 125 was open
Ask about me, I put in enough work to get the brag rights
I was a bastard in my past life
Fast forward, still mad nice
The goal ain't changed, 'til the whole world know my name
Kush God, when they greet me
Im good in the hood, Im come through
I give'em hope when they see me
Rock on, keep the hope alive
Hard work pays off, keep your head up high
Do you believe?

It's the Kush...God
I do this for my niggas and niggas like me
Rest of the world'll catch on to it more than likely
It is what it is
Let a nigga live
Rrriiiight
