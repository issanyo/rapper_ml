[Hook: Devin the Dude]
I like to ride, while I’m getting high
I like to roll, while I’m getting blowed
I like to ride, while I’m getting high (Pass off!)
I like to roll, while I’m getting blowed
On some killer smoke

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Break up break up, Headband in the paper
Take a couple pulls of the doobie and holla “stay up”
I roll up, I don’t fuck with the (?)rose(?)
And I don’t put nothing but Kleanex next to my nose
Riding shotgun, I be high
Bad broad rolling another one, while she drive
We blow, then I dabble with my kush stock
Blow a ounce in the hood, fuck it, it's Woodstock
It's that really really good pot
Make your hood pop, increase your hood stock
The bud smoke's never ending
Substance abusing, pun intended

I like to ride, while I'm getting high
I like to roll, while I'm getting blowed
I like to ride, while I'm getting high
I like to roll, while I'm getting blowed
On some killer smoke

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Far from a novice, bud in the jar shit
Afghan kush comin straight from harvest
Dump a forty fuck them other suckers
Spark it up (?) I’m higher than a mother fucker
Rooftop, rolling see the view of the city with me
My life's the high life, be smooth
Picture me, rollin down the avenue
With your bitch, bumping my shit, chucking a deuce
Smell of dour on the rug be overpowering the blow cologne
Just sold some zones. Came home, then a rolled a zone
Hit the couch, got comatose

[Hook: Devin the Dude]
I like to ride, while I'm getting high

I like to ride, while I'm getting high
I like to roll, while I'm getting blowed

[Verse 3: Smoke DZA]
DZA, in the hood they call me Buddy Lee
Cause I always got that good shit, lucky me
You be puffing on that bullshit, sucks for you
But fuck it, do what you do, whatever works is cool
I don't never disrespect my lungs
And I ain't fucking with the brown shit, I'm good on the blunts
My niggas call me Hollywood but my bud, my rules
Nigga im good
