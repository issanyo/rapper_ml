[Intro: Rick Ross]
2 o'clock in the morning and the sun shining bright nigga on this side, Dizzle. Uh, praying all my niggas live long, pray all my niggas rich forever, you heard me? We black kings, you heard me? Nigga Ethiopian descent, uh

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
I'm from this lil part of Harlem, shit is like Iraq
Young boy barking but his gat bite back
Nigga playing, you will lay, life facts
Take Eric Gardner killers, give me Sean Price back
Where that dour actually light that
Cali broad showing me her new boobs on iChat
Headlights beaming, she all excited
Can't wait for me to touch her, give her that Midas
Livest living legend, Larry Zbyszko
Unleash the pitbulls, it's lit though
Few niggas tried to play 'em
He did nothing, left 'em laying 'nother shame
I had to kill my son like Kanan
Niggas playing with the wrong knife in the drawer
Money on your head, put your life on the wall
Smokestradamus, I be visioning things
As I'm lighting up this skittle in the 600 Benz

[Hook: Smoke DZA]
Big figures way before rap, all black 600 Benz
Big nigga lighting that pack, lay back counting my ends
Big figures way before rap, all black 600 Benz
Big nigga lighting that pack, lay back counting my ends

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
She's in seek of perfection, she should start with her soul
What makes you a soldier? How quick you climb out a hole
Threw us under the basement, now it's penthouses and homes
Food stamps and Medicaid raised every nigga I know
Give you the signal when the cigars get lit
Now we owning our masters on some mobster shit
Another Benz, got the Beamer with the doors up
Case of blunts, half a pound reeking on the tour bus
I'd rather walk than ride with a pussy nigga
Corns and callouses with pride in my Gucci slippers
Can't be talking global to a bitch who local
Can't be rolling up, smoking just to pass niggas your roaches
Why you making threats, never busting a hammer
Niggas sleeping on me, heavy starches pajamas
You're looking at a hustler with a cause
Remember a nigga name but call me the fucking boss

[Hook: Smoke DZA]
Big figures way before rap, all black 600 Benz
Big nigga lighting that pack, lay back counting my ends
Big figures way before rap, all black 600 Benz
Big nigga lighting that pack, lay back counting my ends

[Outro]
Counting my ends like, May-may-maybach Music
Counting my ends like, May-may-maybach Music
Counting my ends like, May-may-maybach Music
Counting my ends like, May-may-maybach Music
Counting my ends like, May-may-maybach Music
New-new-new York shit, New-new-new York shit
New-new-new York shit, New-new-new York shit
New-new-new York shit, New-new-new York shit
