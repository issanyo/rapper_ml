[Talking]
Right, you see, life is what you make it
And my life I’ve been stressed, but I’ve been blessed
You see, life is about obstacles; it’s about getting over
Not getting caught, you shovel that?

[Verse]
It was easy street that how it looked the strangest
But since I had twins, that was a game changer
My whole game changed up, gotta get things in order
August 21st, 2008, my son and daughter arrived
I swear to God on that day I was the happiest nigga alive
A new chapter in my life, already had practice overseeing
Taking care of little Ian, that’s my son too
Trying to make his moms understand
A woman can't teach a boy how to be a man
Now the shit is starting to hit the fan
Same arguments over and over again
Real life kicking in, and she looking at rap like where's the ends
Still hustle though I say I’m finished
Cause I ain't have a one of them publishing check in a minute
Get some bud get my buzz back
Got love for the game but they ain't got no love back
I just channel the stress into my songs
And thrive on proving all the non-believers wrong
Pressure got a nigga on the wall
My plan A is plan B, or nothing at all
Bill collectors say I owe too much
Wifey say I ain't got time, say I flow too much
Niggas mad at me, say I joke too much
They got the nerve to ask a nigga why I smoke so much
It’s crazy
