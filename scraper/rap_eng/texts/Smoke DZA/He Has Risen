[Verse 1]
You know I'm fresh off the block with it, watch how I pop with it
Them other niggas is fronting trust me they not with it
They been blew they cover, so front no further
Peace to the 'Lo Gods, one L ain't good without the other
Another Harlem day, you know the same shit
Broad salmon from Devin's right there on St. Nick
Well done, take it back to the scoop
Wash it down with a pad porter from Benson's Got Juice
Nothing to lose, everyday in the game
But this way from the start and I hope it never change
And I do my thang, you should do the same
Instead you niggas trying to carpool my lane
Uh, well God damn, the fucking menace I am
The global dominance homeboy I got plans
Hold up, niggas hate but so what? for the size I roll up
Touring the Atlas while the world hail nuts
Give me my dick back, Steve-o got me loopy owe him some kickback
It's about to crazy my niggas, my word
I got you Johny, this joint is for us
This for the times these niggas tried to front on us
Same nigga throwing shots when I was down
Eating humble pie now it's the other way around
Pinky and thumb to my Jet Life niggas, Kushed God in this motherfucker
He has risen
