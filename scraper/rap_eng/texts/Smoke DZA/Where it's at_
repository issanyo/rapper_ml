[Intro]
(Where the weed at?)
Ahhh
DZA
Right
(Smoke DZA)
Aye, you can't tell me nothin' bout this bud man
How much bread I done made off that kush that OG
Ahhh, Ron Browz, Smoke DZA

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
I twist backwoods and smoke dutchies, you can't touch me
Kush god, none above me, you just custy
Worker, still dusty, unlucky
Whole family a lil [?] ya pops pump for me
This for my West Indians twisting fanta leaf
Lots of ganja tree in my dungaree's, man
You can't get caught slippin', eh
Body fall victim to this cold cold game of life
Not trippin' at all it's my business to ball
They say you only live one life, so me, im tryin' to get mines off(hear me)
I'm off the Waikiki got a couple zips with me, man
Can't leave home without it might ship to diddy
Keep it litty I don't pity the fool
Everyone shall take blame for what they do
Unstoppable, my price is un-coppable
Sly chicks un-poppable, you in hot pursuit

[Bridge]
(Where the weed at?)
Right
Right
In case you ain't know
(Smoke DZA, the kush god)

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Unh, How dare ye push work barely
Spare me with the drug talk its off air-y
I get bread yearly ________[?]_________
Made some mistakes, paid them all cash
Took the brass ring, that ain't a bad thing
I'm tapped in, nigga tripled up since last spring
Right, I give assignments no consignment
Niggas love to get lost boy freaky tying
Flyin' in the Cayenne, vision me in Humboldt
Smokin' something my son grow
This type of chronic you sell an eighth for a hundo'
I'm flyin' high but stayin' low from columbo
Just one more thing and I'll be done for, Y'all don't hear me
Diamonds dancing in the watch like they came form alvanelli
Far from ordinary, they slap now they jumpin' on my sack the more the merry
Fuck all them other weird drugs it's only Mary in my bloodstream
Every time you hit my line im hustling
Think it's ever over then you buggin', buggin'
Go pick a pack off the tree, fam, it's nothin'
