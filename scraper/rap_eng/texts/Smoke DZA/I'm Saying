[Intro]
Riiiiiight
It’s that cinematic shit
It’s that Black Apple shit
Everything’s extravagant
It’s a higher way of life
And I’m all in

[Verse 1]
I’m that nigga, that’s why your bitch is all on me
Introduce her to the shrimp over at Bond Street
Let her shop, show her I think of her fondly
I toss and cop, I don’t even do laundry
It’s Goodwill after I one-wear them
My ears popping, nigga, I can never hear them
Big nigga, popping all of the models
Molton Bown body wash, 38 bucks a bottle
What up? Buddy Love up in this motherfucker
Senseless, still a motherfucker
Big business, baby, nothing like them other suckers
Steady tryna keep tags on ya, tryna cuff ya, nah
Do your thing, baby, you freed up
Just respect yourself and keep it G’d up
Barack preaching ‘bout change
And I know you sick of fucking with them lames
I’m saying

[Chorus]
Baby girl, I ain’t hating, that’s a sucker move
But choose up if you tryna catch a W
You could meet me at the W
Got dour by the ounce, Zeros, they by the case, too
Hit the spa, get a facial
The way you do it make them other broads hate you
Keep them suckers in they lane
Fuck with this fly shit and quit playing, I’m saying

[Verse 2]
Riiiiight, you tryna fuck with a boss or a worker?
You gotta treat yourself, baby, don’t cheat yourself
Do the right thing, ‘cause baby girl, you deserve to
Be the First Lady in my White House
You should be iced out, instead of arguing bout petty shit
Like your mandatory mani- and pedi- shit
He ain’t bout bread
He just wanna smoke dirt and watch bootlegs
Shake from that nigga, you should do that
‘Cause when you fuck with a wack nigga, that make you wack
Come enhance your shoe game up some
Red bottoms, no more of them Nine West joints
What you waiting for? Ain’t nothing else to think ‘bout
Get boujee on that nigga, ‘cause it’s in style
One move got you right up in the In-Crowd
Lebron James shit, you need to win now
Ha, I’m saying

[Bridge]
When in doubt, let me be the one you go to
Little mama need guidance? Let me coach you
Keep your head up when them fast-talkers approach you
It’s never too late, I can still mold you
Focus up, you should be Venice-slacking
It feel a little different in the winners’ bracket
It’s time for a change
Them lame niggas fucking up the game, I’m saying

[Chorus]
Baby girl, I ain’t hating, that’s a sucker move
But choose up if you tryna catch a W
You could meet me at the W
Got dour by the ounce and rosé by the case, too
Hit the spa, get a facial
The way you do it make them other broads hate you
Keep them suckers in they lane
Fuck with this fly shit and quit playing, I’m saying

[Outro]
I’m saying
You tryna fuck with this winners’ circle?
Or you tryna fuck with them squares?
No, don’t do that freaky shit over here
It’s that Black Apple shit
It’s that cinematic shit
DZA! Riiiiiight
