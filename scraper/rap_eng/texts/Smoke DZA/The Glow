My type of motivation

[Chorus]
You see my bitch, she like
(Go daddy, go daddy, go daddy, go daddy)
You see my bitch, she like
(Go daddy, go daddy, go daddy, go daddy)
Swag check, bag check, glow
Big ring, even bigger chain, watch it glow
Brag test, gas test, glow
Roll bout seven bombers in a row

[Verse 1]
Roll up, light up, lift my soul
Thats my preference thats my flow
That consignment shit is slow
You don't know me don't call me bro
You know don't me don't call me bro
That's how I'm rocking know your roll
Ain't no logos but it's 'Lo, my girl in Gucci and she cold

[Chorus]
You see my bitch, she like
(Go daddy, go daddy, go daddy, go daddy)
You see my bitch, she like
(Go daddy, go daddy, go daddy, go daddy)
Swag check, bag check, glow
Big ring, even bigger chain, watch it glow
Brag test, gas test, glow
Roll bout seven bombers in a row

[Verse 2]
She gave me her heart, told me you break it you buy it
She always cool always mellow, made me just trust in the process
Want me to swallow my pride, hoping my ego would digest
I'm like stay humble for what? They take advantage of modest
Running my lane in designer shit don't need no Dry Fit
Niggas be thinking they prophets
Misleading the youth while they profit
Me I'm still tryna process how they be using their logic
He know he a square he denying it
He say he the plug I'm like I guess
I guess he gon' front till his dying breath

[Chorus]
You see my bitch, she like
(Go daddy, go daddy, go daddy, go daddy)
You see my bitch, she like
(Go daddy, go daddy, go daddy, go daddy)
Swag check, bag check, glow
Big ring, even bigger chain, watch it glow
Brag test, gas test, glow
Roll bout seven bombers in a row

[Outro]
She gave me her heart
