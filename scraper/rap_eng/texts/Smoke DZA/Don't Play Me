[Hook][x2]
I fucked your lady, she said I’m wavy
Don’t try to play me, these niggas crazy
We got dope like it’s from the 80s
Don’t try to play me, don’t try to play me

[Verse 1 – Smoke DZA]
Don’t try to play me, don’t try to play me
She threw the pussy like she Tom Brady
She said she pregnant need some cash for AB
But how she pregnant, guess her mouth had babies
I pulled up, hit her, all in my Mercedes
Doggy bit my style, I’m still shocked, on rabies
It’s all gravy, I’m extra wavy
Diamonds dancing like it’s hearing break beats
God damn I’m cold, when I’m in my mode, should have a zillion sold
Really fucking cool jet
Young niggas ain’t done with school and yet
From the AM to the PM, take advantage, carpe diem
Niggas rode up your per diem, got your BM in my DMs

[Verse 2 – Curren$y]
Air max 87, my closet is sneaker heaven
Stepping in and out some fresh ones
Not a scuff on my right or left one
Veteran, young style learn ya how to earn it
Parlay little bit but don’t burn it
I’m really cool i could freeze the furnace
Watch me turn this corner into a company
Baby girl got good sense too, that’s why she fuck with me
Cool sitting, twisting glue sticks, to ride with new shit
Fool this the set at your motherfucking neck
To your death, filling bags with that money till it’s nothing left
Then we left, smoking Js on the jet
Shoot a jumper with my left, just to flex the range
Pull my truck in front the club to do the same
