[Intro: Hodgy Beats]
Box it out, box it out, box it out, uhh
Yup.. yup, yup

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I wanna retire like Jay Leno, but not at his age
I write the book of my life, I'm one hell of a page
You niggas ain't promotin', your confusion is daze
I'm on these bitches minds like running loose in a maze
You drinkin' Goose and get chased
I'll take the bottle to the face
I'll take the bottle to your face
And I'm leaving without a trace of a scrap
I'm not the man talkin' 'bout busting grapes in a cape
Watch your bitch before I make her mind your mistake
Took her on accident, that's a miss-take
If you want beef, order up, I'm a big steak
I don't do it for the fame, I get it in just for my kid's sake
You live with your bitch, nigga do what your bitch say
Get 'em H-LO like a motherfuckin' river lake
Get hip to my shit like you moved to Silver Lake
You flippin' burgers and fries, gimmie a shake
And hurry up, take the money, you're makin' me late

[Hook: Smoke DZA & Domo Genesis] X4
Lame niggas take 5

You rap niggas better miss me with the bullshit (bullshit, bullshit)
You rap niggas better miss me with the bullshit (bullshit, bullshit)

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Whip the game like a ho with the pimp hand
Loud weed made me wish I had a kick stand
Wartime, my face painted like a KISS fan
Nigga got stripes like Reggie Miller's wristband
Crush my wake and my vision you prayin' you gettin' mangled
Got this whole shit on lock, I'm Kurt Angle
If I go out young, I just pray that I see angels
I know that I'll be buried a G, I lived graceful
No peace for a young live nigga, I'm still smokin'
Painted scriptures of mine, nigga picture me rollin'
Careful on these streets, don't know what these niggas holdin'
And be careful what you hit, scandalous bitches ho-in'
Door to success, we kick it until it open
Got a one track mind and I run it like Jesse Owens
Ho, it's however you want it, a verbal full clip
You rap niggas better miss me with the bullshit (bullshit, bullshit)

[Hook] X4

[Verse 3: Smoke DZA]
Right
Lame niggas take 5 (take 5)
Fall back, let the winners work (ah)
Cleaned up the whole summer and I'm 'bout to do the winter worse (really)
Vacation and online banking, every second is a new QuickPay alert (right)
We listened to your shit when we was loaded nigga, and we laughed til our stomach hurt
Ah man, international fuckers I'm barrin'
I'm a block nigga 9/11 zoomin' down 8th in a 7 probably headed up to Devin's swinging corners like Tarzan
Ah damn, you niggas can keep the hookah, I'mma fuck with this buddha
Creepin' ? short state joint, called the bitch up a uber
She tried to get comfortable and spend the night
You know I had to maneuver, fly out that bitch like it's Jet Life
Some smooth shit queued up
Ah, she don't want no man
Fuck playin' games, this ain't Funcoland
Cool shit don't make a move but them hundos can
Get that bullshit outta here, Mutumbo hand

[Verse 4: Curren$y]
Uh, higher than most (most)
Stackin' this toast (toast)
Swang in the bank (bank)
Deposit the loaf (loaf)
Cop me some dank (dank)
That's gas fo sho (gas fo sho)
Fill up the tank (tank)
Slab on the road (road, man)
Money mission (money mission)
Bitch a tower heist (tower heist)
Diamonds glisten, Christmas trimmings, Vegas lights
Mercedes figure 8 'em, Porsches racin', coked up ladies
Laser chasin', dancin' crazy, 80's life
When machines guns and gold chains ruled the dope game (dope game)
Luxury speed boats, pontoon planes
Keep it low like we smugglin' cane (like we smugglin' cane)
Blazed in the Everglades, scribblin' my next payday
Life
