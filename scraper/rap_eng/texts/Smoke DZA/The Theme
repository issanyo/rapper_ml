[Intro]
It’s light work, it’s light work though
Watch how I do this

[Verse]
Rain sleet snow, dank E O’s
Ringside 3, go head thank me though
Me and 3rd got the streets so far 3 0
Don’t know when I’mma stop, KushedGod speak yo
I’m bad news brown slash kilo
Special delivery, SD Jones
Andre wanna rep Cheetah Homes
Fuck with me better leave me alone
Stay up in the zone, never go astray
Too many [?] in the way
Got all my pizzas in a ray
You bastards gon’ learn today
It’s all a fact, I’m all ‘a’ that
You hatin’ like Bobby just call the match
Arrogance like [?] tell I’m back
JBO close line the track
Matter fact Stan Hansen that
Matter fact, style my space so you chancin’ that
Put you out where you can’t come back
Send my homies at you, long [?] like the anthem [?]
