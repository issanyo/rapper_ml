[Intro:]
"Na na na na naa na!" [x8]

[Verse 1:]
"I'm riding down the grove in my black Deville
Looking for some pro's that perhaps can chill
High as I glide by Summerhill
Bathing Ape, Lacoste, I'm dressed to kill
Can't be swerving, my cup could spill
My pimp game worth 'bout a half-a-mil
I'm heavy in the trunk, so the front pop a wheelie
Her face be an eight, and her ass is so pretty
I step into the room & illuminate the haters
They hating on a kid, cause I'm a super-fly player
Heavy hitter, rhyme spit'er, ***** now or later
But still I get respect from Detroit to Decatur
Here to get paper
After that I'll see you later
Big and I'm major
Homie you a faker, faker
This is where I take ya
Go head, do your thing
While you do your thing, I'm a do my thing chuuh!"

[Hook:]
"So what you want
What you got
What you need brothering
I'm a make it hot"
[X4]

[Verse 2:]
"Now I'm a make it hot, I'm a make you sweat
Never out of line, I keep my girls in check
From the bottom to the top of the deck
I ain't no chump nigga I demands respect
We stay high, yeah we puff the cess
Weed on my breath, diamonds on my neck
Tatted up, I splatter guts when I sex
She gave it a test drive, she never drove a Lexus
See when I'm in your city man they treat me like Diddy
Got to give a shout out to my cousin frank nitty
Fly by-coastal from LA to Philly
Excuse me if I bump you, I'm a little bit tipsy
You can ask fifty, my city's so gritty, gritty
Ho's say they miss me, but still they know the dilly, dilly
Digga stay crispy
See I'm a do my thing
While I do my thing, you go do your thing chuuh!"

[Hook x4]

[Refrain:]
"Dangerous
We're so dangerous
My whole entire unit is dangerous
We're so dangerous
So dangerous
My Starbwoyz crew be dangerous!" [x2]

[Hook x4]
