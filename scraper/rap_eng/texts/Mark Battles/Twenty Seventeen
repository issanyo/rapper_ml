[Intro: Mark Battles]
Nah, she good
Just tell her, "Don't be doin' all that talkin' and shit, shhh"

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
"Too wavy for a lil boat", I think that's what I heard 'em say
My niggas keep a lil UZI and aim it at your vertebrae
Walkin' in with 21 savages if you perpetrate
Really here for peace and love, so let them vibes circulate
Busy tryin' to earn respect, you busy tryin' to earn a break
Feel I ain't seen nothin' yet, that's why we in here workin' late
Smooth with the flow, now these lesbo hoes is turnin' straight
Was told I'd be rewarded for patience, so I've learned to wait
But now it's twenty seventeen, pray we on to better things
Witness sights we've never seen, what's a queen without a king
Ha, a very strong woman
I was raised by a lady, and she told me keep on pushin'
Stay working while they sleepin', don't just do it when they lookin'
I always seemed to feel I could, even when I couldn't
So book it, we on the next flight, I gotta see some shit
If I can't enjoy my own pie, don't want a piece of it
If you wit' it, I'm wit' it, don't never need convince
See you can offer a mile, might only keep a inch
How could I be content, I used to sleep in tents
Openin' act for Rocky Fresh, it didn't equal shit
So these niggas slept on me
Now it's cars for everybody, guess I got some blessed homies
They always kept it real like way before the deal
It ain't never what you got, to me it's how you feel
I ain't in it for the thrill, see, we just tryna build, G
No fake stage name, so you can get the real me
Left the streets in my past, wanna take it there then feel free
No I.D. said I can be great and I will be

[Outro: Mark Battles]
I will be
Twenty seventeen
Fly America
