[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
What's your name,miss,do you speak my language?
I do my thing,you can say I'm sort of famous
You're walking home all alone
I think it's dangerous
Not to be rude
But can I ask you who you came with?
Oh,you already know who I am
You can keep it on the low
You can go where I am
Be cool
It's up to you
Lady tell me the plan
I don't smoke but yo
Sam got them green eggs and ham
And I hit him, on the text
What's next?
Got me some sorta pressed
Body looking proper
I can see it through your dress
What challenge got you right?
Got to say you aced the test
You a mess

[Hook : Mark Battles]
She wild and said she's from Coney Island
I bet I can make her fall in love

I just wanna D her up, Tony Allen
I gotta D her up, Tony Allen
You're wild and said you're from Coney Island
I can make you fall in love
Bet a thousand
I just wanna D her up, Tony Allen
I gotta D her up, Tony Allen

[Verse 2: Emelio Rojas]
And you remind me of a girl I used to kick it with
Similar but different
And she lived in the heights ,right by you
What a coincidence
She got a son, a family, always trying to rescue all
Kind of like the same thing that you do for your nephew though
I never met him
She ain't liked when people came around
Cause his father crazy
Kind of like a nephew father now
He ain't never put a dollar down
Shit he never wifed her
She said she's struggling
So let's go get some diapers
Well that's fine with me
And we can pick him up
He can ride with me
And we can watch some of your sisters work cause I know how it be
My momma raised me solo, ain't nobody lend a helping hand
Stepping in to help your sister
Cause she fucked a selfish man
You're stuck in class
He can stay at my crib
Just send his momma a text with my address and the block where I live
Oh,she says she knows my building
Man,that's the bitch I used to deal with

[Hook : Mark Battles]
She wild and said she's from Coney Island
I bet I can make her fall in love
Bet on a thousand
I just wanna D her up, Tony Allen
I gotta D her up, Tony Allen
You're wild and said you're from Coney Island
I can make you fall in love
Bet a thousand
I just wanna D her up, Tony Allen
I gotta D her up, Tony Allen
