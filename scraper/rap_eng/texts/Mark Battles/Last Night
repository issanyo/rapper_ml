[Intro]
Ya'll on one
Well we on two
Skies the limit
Gon' tell me what we gon' do
Knew I was in the world
Cuz I'm with my crew
We gon' skip right through
And live it like our last night

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
Getting right the night fall so young
Team stay winning not a loss gon' come
And I'm with G
And I'm with Phenom
Plus I'm with Young
Yeah we all on one
Main buzz so the women wanna act right
Known for my rhyming now I'm shining like a flashlight
Keep swerving lanes when we living in the fast life
Do it like your last night
That's life

[Chorus]
Ya'll on one
Well we on two
Skies the limit
Gon' tell me what we gon' do
Knew I was in the world
Cuz I'm with my crew
We gon' skip right through
And live it like our last night (night)
We gon' live it like our last night (night)
We gon' live it like our last night
What we gon' do?
We gon' skip right though
And live it like our last night

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
Keep it moving like we got evicted
Glasses on our lids, and they not prescriptions
Throw your shades on just to block the misfits
My day been going wrong but I'm optimistic
Spotted me a chick that was hot from distance
Cool little hips but she not the thickest (naw)
Nice little gloss on the spot she kiss with
I want you but I don't
Is that a contradiction?
Well, okay, it's on to the next
Feeling good in my mind
I'm in my zone looking fresh
Looking for the groupie that's known for the sex
I'mma throw on a Magnum and hope for the best (Oh Wow)
Oh yeah, we can get naughty
Do me, I do you, that's a no-no shorty
You can do me, then it's back to the party
Just make sure I come first like Carly

[Chorus]
Ya'll on one
Well we on two
Skies the limit
Gon' tell me what we gon' do
Knew I was in the world
Cuz I'm with my crew
We gon' skip right through
And live it like our last night (night)
We gon' live it like our last night (night)
We gon' live it like our last night
What we gon' do?
We gon' skip right though
And live it like our last night
(repeat x2)
