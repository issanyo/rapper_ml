I said it’s just another day

[Hook]
This ain’t no way to live
No, food in the fridge man we was just kids you know
I said it’s just another day
And quit telling us she owe that money
Coming the slow way ain’t nowhere to go
You know
I said it’s just another day
I said it’s just another
It’s just another
It’s just another
It’s just a
I said it’s just another day

[Verse 1]
This love is hard my
Hard to understand that failure is a part of trying
See I like to keep a smile through the darkest time
I never knew me until now but I make me proud
My mama wow love that lady smile
She said they might hurt you now but they won’t break you down
What’s pain without lessons
Grew up in the desert so I made it my profession
Focused on my own never hated on a next one
Read between the lines like way before I checked them
These fools stretching the truth i’m really riding with proof
I’m talking crackers and juice for dinner
My nigga Lennard got jacked for his boots
Came back with a strap i’ll get em back in a few
Confused life with money that’s stacked to the roof
If the country falls apart then what happens to you
This ain’t follow the leader it’s follow the eagle
Not the bullshit that they constantly feeding you on
I don’t need to find a reason it’s Pensylvania clear
I just gotta hope it

[Hook]
This ain’t no way to live
No, food in the fridge man we was just kids you know
I said it’s just another day
And quit telling us she owe that money
Coming the slow way ain’t nowhere to go
You know
I said it’s just another day
I said it’s just another
It’s just another
It’s just another
It’s just a
I said it’s just another day

[Verse 2]
They want me to stop they want me to quit
They want me to falter and fail
They want me to rap they want me to smile
They want me to alter myself
They want me to turn the cheek
But I turn to [?] to a prophet
What’s worse a empty soul
Or a empty hole in your pocket
They profiting from your delusion
So what are you losing
Your money your self esteem the minute you chose becomes confusion
So how do you fuse it without you sacrificing either
My first time in the booth I was so nervous and eager
Now i’m feeding off the frivolous shit they tricking us
Reminiscing we used to switch tags so inconspicuous
Walking in the mall for work taking no losses
The dressing room in Macy’s was like ma personal office
Man it’s just another day so another struggle is brewing
Pursuing something that’s deeper than what you see when you viewing it
[?] in the trumpet trunk of the car
If I don’t reach it today then tomorrow I will

[Hook]
I said it’s just another day
This ain’t no way to live
No, food in the fridge man we was just kids you know
I said it’s just another day
And quit telling us she owe that money
Coming the slow way ain’t nowhere to go
You know
I said it’s just another day
I said it’s just another
It’s just another
It’s just another
It’s just a
I said it’s just another day

[Verse 3]
Like why the hell you asking for
I’m tired of the back and forth
Mellow tore my ankle while i’m fitting through the microphone
Better off when i’m alone
Sorry that i’m in my zone
Quiet for attention lately
Rather be a human being yet  I gotta set the tone
Wonder why these mamas crying all these young people dying
Waiting for my time to come all I know is that i’m trying
What’s the [?] thing to do
Scratch off keep away from feuds
Mama say a prayer cause we tryna make a living
Screaming out the world [?] could die any minute
Say a prayer for your boy it’s all good intentions
Now it’’s more than just twitter where ma name’s mentioned
I’m not into wishing nor school or tuition
Every line I say real like we going wishing
Young black male living will I fall victim
I’m just telling the truth but to you

[Hook]
This ain’t no way to live
No, food in the fridge man we was just kids you know
I said it’s just another day
And quit telling us she owe that money
Coming the slow way ain’t nowhere to go
You know
I said it’s just another day
I said it’s just another
It’s just another
It’s just another
It’s just a
I said it’s just another day
