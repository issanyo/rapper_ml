Chorus:
How Long it gonna take to break through?
You could either let this hate motivate or break you
They say a lot of things about me that just ain’t true
But I made a promise to myself to stay faithful
To my art, this my heart, this my passion
They can talk all they want
They won’t get a reaction
I had to cut the distractions
I had a call to take action
This is that law of attraction
You gotta see it before it happen

Verse 1:
From the drop
Man I give this all I got
Calling a&r’s and bloggers
But can’t get a response
I guess cuz I ain’t popping yet
Okay just watch
Remember even Steve jobs started off in a garage
Nobody wanna fuck with you til everybody fuck with you
Then once they do watch how they get so comfortable
Act like you owe me something
Like they grew up with you
When you was broke and hungry
They the first to eat in front of you
That’s why I’m sticking with the same team
Shouts to otto, Tony, jack, Tyler, ac
We on the way
Man I seen this shit in a dream
And shout to every fuckin fan that’s been believing in me lets get it

Verse 2 (Mark Battles):
Hey you, yeah come over here
Enjoy the vibe look
I’m going full throttle
Til my knees wobble
You can always rep the squad
Know the 3’s got you
I’m still seeing through the mist like a febreeze bottle
A lot of ni**as turn they back and make the team hostile
But that pain could help you grow
It’s my turn on the low I feel I had to let em know so if you hesitate
Might get second place
She say she love me
Let me hit it on the second date
Them lame ni**as side eyeing had to set em straight
Impress the greats measure fate then I record break
You see I plan to be the greatest first a man must understand a chance before he take it
Ima be underrated
And that’s a understatement
It’s hard come from places they don’t value preservation
And nothings ever sacred
Let the love conquer hatred
Get caught up in the matrix
Battles

Verse 3:
Lost a lot of friends and I lost of patience lost a lot a faith in people dealing with the fakeness said they'd be around for me but we ain't spoke in ages so when they say they dap me up that shit just makes me anxious I'm trying not to let this world take my heart from me trying to see the light but at times it's fucking hard for me cuz only time they come around is when they see me popping like hey bro I saw you online aye when that cd dropping can I cop a few cuz your shit hot for real then when you down you disappear like David copperfield so it's hard to feel I could just pop a pill big that ain't me so I treat this pain like dr phil member the days of hey Arnold and trl nowadays it's hard just to be our selves so fuck it I don't know what I need in life to fill the void I'm moving at the speed of light
