Did you warm up my apple juice? Thank you

[Chorus: Mark Battles]
Like here we go againnn, I'm back
Gotta put my city on the map
Had to get my bro out the trap
Shows gettin' packed like here we go againnn
Let's ride, everybody one hundred on my side
Niggas know I'll die for my squad, eye for an eye
Here we go againnn
Here we go againnn

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
I'm done playin' this is it, really feelin' blessed God gave me a gift
Yeah, that's my side chick but she faithful as shit
3s up, Vs up and I ain't gonna quit
Had her on her knees givin' thanks to the dick
Fell in love quick, put my name on her tit
Gang in this bitch, flame as it gets
When we talkin' about greats, put my name in the mix
Feed me a beat, I'ma mangle the shit
Insides blue like I strangled the whip
Do anything for a shirt and a pic
F.O.D. know you heard of the clique
We're all authentic, every word is legit
See you goin' fast but you swervin' and shit
Niggas peewee league, better learn how to hit
Self made nigga, yeah I earned every bit (quit)
Can you stop with the pop shots?
Got guap in our socks, now we top notch
I get this bitch jumpin' like hopscotch
Takin' anybody here for the top spot
Nigga you don't want no smoke, like a nigga that don't smoke that be sittin' there quiet in a hotbox
Better watch for the shot clock, 3s up, nigga why not?

[Chorus: Mark Battles]
Now here we go againnn, I'm back
Gotta put my city on the map
Had to get my bro out the trap
Shows gettin' packed like here we go againnn
Let's ride, everybody want a hundred on the side
Niggas know I die for my squad, eye for an eye
Here we go againnn

[Bridge: Mark Battles]
I been this way for so long
I swear to God I ain't changin'
I'm just thankin' God that we made it
Don't come up short on my payments
That's dangerous (that's dangerous)
I'm livin' life they can't tame me
No favors, no favors
Like here we go again

[Verse 2: Futuristic]
Yo, Here we go again
I'ma pull up on em in a brand new Benz
Day 1 homies, ain't no new friends
Hella bars in the car, we don't do this for pretend
Regardless, heartless if they cross me
Always came the hardest, watch 'em, they my offspring
Often been the target, the wall my back was up on it
You broad wanna back up on it, I'm guarded, momma you lost me
I don't play games with it, independent hall of fame with it, with my name written
You ain't bang with us, you a fake, you stay kiddin'
You say you wanna see me when I'm out but you stay hidden
I don't stray with it, you play pimpin', I'm ballin'
6 figure cheques still on the desk in my office
6 did it best, I'm growin', it's time to harvest
Smarter with the talkin' you think that I went to Harvard
Coffins I'm fillin' em, feelin' like I need Ritalin
Drillin' 'em off adrenaline, someone gonna need to reel 'em in
Riddles written with synonyms, venomous
Futuristic is iller then competition, I'm in it to get the benjamins
Give em to all my niggas and take a trip with some women friends
Genuine since beginning, my vision is what I'm livin' in
Woah, that boy cold, I'ma pass it to my nigga like

[Chorus: Mark Battles]
Now here we go againnn, I'm back
Gotta put my city on the map
Had to get my bro out the trap
Shows gettin' packed like here we go againnn
Let's ride, everybody want a hundred on the side
Niggas know I die for my squad, eye for an eye
Here we go againnn
Here we go againnn

[Bridge: Mark Battles]
I been this way for so long
I swear to God, I ain't changin'
I'm just thankin' God that we made it
Don't come up short on my payments
That's dangerous (that's dangerous)
I'm livin' life that can't tame me
No favours, no favours
Like here we go again

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
Niggas sell papers just to put dick in a slut
Terminator guns, should of lift up a truck
Squares in a circle, can't kick it with us
We in the bitch, got it lit like cigarette butts
Unorthodox, they can't put me in a box
A-town nigga till they put me in a box
I'm flexin' on 'em, tell 'em put me in the drop
My diamonds two step, bank account Milly Rock
Trap niggas at the Met Galla, MAC-11 uh, watch the head splatter
Put 'em in the ocean with the red snappers
Guillotine Benton, I behead rappers
Hoppin' out the foreign like [?], gangster bitch servin' niggas, soccer
Hatin' as nigga get a hobby, gang of bad bitches give me sloppy
Poppin' tags, threw a bag at a body, fresh to death, toe tag on my body
Kamikaze hitman, Luca Brasi, bullet holes in your man's new Ferarri
My side bitch let me fuck her and her friends
If you ain't fam nigga then it's fuck you and your friends
It's the God in this bitch, the whole city goin' in
Got the motherfucker jumpin' like

[Chorus: Mark Battles]
Now here we go againnn, I'm back
Gotta put my city on the map
Had to get my bro out the trap
Shows gettin' packed like here we go againnn
Let's ride, everybody want a hundred on the side
Niggas know I die for my squad, eye for an eye
Here we go againnn
Here we go againnn

[Bridge: Mark Battles]
I been this way for so long
I swear to God, I ain't changin'
I'm just thankin' God that we made it
Don't come up short on my payments
That's dangerous (that's dangerous)
I'm livin' life that can't tame me
No favours, no favours
Like here we go againnn
