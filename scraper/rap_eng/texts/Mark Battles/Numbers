[Intro]
Yeah, I feel big
If you know anything about me
You know every time I walking around
I'm repping them 3s
Every time you see me out at the mall, see me grocery shopping, see me eating a damn chicken sandwich
I'm repping them 3s
Its Fly America

[Verse 1]
Not gonna stand put my city on the map
It's the 317 I'm the nigga where I'm at
Call him young one prolly make him bring it back
100 days a year show these haters how to act
Indiana balling like a Pacer but I rap
Mama raised me in the trap and I came out with a scratch
Eye for a eye we can bang out in the back
Everyday like cheating death when you hang out in the nap
Old heads like spit it young and I can really rap forever
Scrap the mission [?]
Watch me put them tracks together
AK for my last endeavour
Vacay to some happy weather
Ask me when I plan to let up, pause, and I tell 'em never
Huh, Imma get what I deserve
Every line atomic bombs when you mix it with my urge
Besides a couple guys I'm the best you ever heard
Every one should take a second let 'em catch up in the third
Seeing all these numbers got me flexing like a nerd
Your girl love every song bet she text you every word
I'm on a mission to be great
And I would die for you if you split what's on my plate
Would always ride for you if give before you take
I respect how much you care
Don't really care how much you make
Go be great!

[Interlude]
Before the deal

[Verse 2]
Get tired of the pain, I get tired of the struggle
When you down and out, it's like nobody love you
Free my nigga Jimmy always taught me how to hustle
Respect me as a man never running from a tussle, humble
But I'm feeling like the greatest
Weak niggas hating but the real niggas play it
Its funny cuz my homies tried to tell me that I made it
But I'm going hard so my community is gated
Eyy man, straight up for the top tier
I'm here, hi dear, this is my year
Drive, steer, try here, till the rights clear
My fear don't exist imma die here
Get to the money if the team need me
When it's dark out, I can make it G-Eazy
Please Jesus come protect from the grieve fetus
Ain't got nothing from these hoes but a cheese pizza
(Yum, Yum, Yum)
You prolly don't believe me
Get the shit jumping like Mario, Luigi
Running through the game and the cardio is easy
Father since a child so I've been here for a reason
Imagine really living what you dreaming
Sucking while I'm sleeping
Oh my gosh she a keeper
Made it out the [?] just to stuff it four seater
These rap niggas whack yo the game sure need us
Going hard till everybody write
All my niggas nice and I don't mean they polite
Dreams become things when my team in the light
Don't freeze up when you see me
Hope you mean what your write...right?
But am I sorry yes
Mama raised to be humble so I hardly flex
Got a body like Kehlani but her heart a mess
Made it out a Cavalier who tryna party next (aaaaahhhh)
(Uhum) Clear throats, it's time to put an end to the weird jokes
See I been killing beats since I was near broke
Teach you how to catch a body like a cheer coach
Hello, I'm here folks
Before the deal

[Outro]
3s up
How did you niggas allow this to happen?
Are you serious?
Yall left the door open for me
The worst mistake of your life
No I.D whats good nigga?
Lets get to this, moneeeey
Hahahahaha
3s up
Shoutout to the who vasi gang
Vasi Papi, Toni Vasi whatever you wanna call me
I ain't interested in nothing else but repping 'em 3s
You know what I mean?
It's fly america
