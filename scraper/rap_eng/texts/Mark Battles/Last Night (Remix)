Ya'll on one, yeah we on two

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
Gettin' right the night fall so young

Known for my rhymin now im shinin' like a flashlight
Keep swearvin' lanes when we livin' in the fast life
Do it like your last night, thats life

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Racks on no racks off
We just trynna party to the last call
Throwin' money in the club like a fastball
Said "if you ain't gettin money get your ass out"
On one but I'm off two shots
Sickest nigga here need a flu shot
Back again, come show the crew love
All them other niggas squares like ?
Man I'm trynna stay high foreva
Look up in the sky its fly america
Ain't nottin' to it gotta natural feelin'
One hand to the ceilin', tell 'em that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mark Battles]
Keep it movin' like we got evicted
Glasses on our lids and they not perscription
Throw your shades on just to block the misfits
My day been goin wrong but im optimistic
Spotted me a chick that was hot from distance
Cool lil hips but she not the thickest
Nice lil gloss on the spot she kiss with
I want you but I don't is that a contradiction?
Well ok, its on to the next
Fellin' good in my mind im in my zone lookin' fresh
Lookin for the groupie that's known for the sex
I'mma throw on a magnum and hope for the best
Oh yeah, we can get naughty
Do me I do you that's a no no shawty
You can do me then it's back to the party
Just make sure I come first like Carly

Ya'll on one, yeah we on two
Skies the limit gon' tell me what we gon' do
Knew I was in the world cuz im with my crew
We gon' skip right through
And live it like our last night
We gon' live it like our last night
We gon' live it like our last night
What we gon' do
We gon' skip right though
And live it like our last night (x2)
