Happy Birthday to me, you know...
I only get one day a year to get to be just about me so
I'm always happy about that, but...
This is for y'all

Battles in the building, Battles never leaving
Yeah it's my birthday, thank the Lord that I'm breathing
Twice I nearly lost my life, I'm here for a reason
Keep my haters in your prayers cause I swear they gon' need it
Believe it, never saw me then you ain't seen fire
Get in the booth and I wreck it just like a teen driver
Reach higher, you tip-toeing on a string wire
Same attire, so why is it that I seem flyer?
He's a liar, he ain't messing with me I'm molesting the beat
Take the secular three leaves, some pressure and leave
Just invest in a seat, cause you're next for defeat
Whoa, ain't none of y'all stopping me
Huh, had to grind for a pot to pee, huh, took a lot for me
Came from the bottom like there ain't no pornography
Follow me, working so hard and it's working so well
City to city, a different hotel
Stayed in my lane and I paved my own trail
Big up to my haters, I know 'em so well, swell
It makes you wanna smack your lips, a master in this action flick
Your bashfulness tells me that you're mad and pissed
To sad and sick, sometimes I brag a bit
But never about cash and whips, I just bagged the baddest chick
On a scale to fifty, she's a 49er, Kaepernick
Matterless, flow is cold, I spit and get the chatter lips
Castro with a rapping gift, dictating half of it
You would think Mark was Cuban, owner of the Mavericks
It's Battles

Hahahahahaha
Yeah... Happy Birthday to me
You know, Happy Birthday to you
This is a gift for y'all
I did this like, 4:30 am
I'm just gonna go enjoy my day
But I wanted y'all to have something
To have fun with, you know?
It's Fly America
