[Verse 1]
I came from the gutter nigga what you expect
I'ma run with my set until these labels start cutting these checks
Pick up my phone thirty texts what's up with my ex
She steady blowing up my line saying she want me for sex
Next, I ain't got time put me in your top five
It's like I run a phone service always got a hotline
Drop bombs, I don't need a clock to know it's my time
Groupies showing breast and thighs think I work at Popeyes
Catch them on the blind side
Hello world, Battles here, started in a cavalier made it to a challenger
Man we bout to have a year soaring out this atmosphere
Started from the bottom now we rocking so you have to cheer
Let it ride

[Hook]
I came from the gutter nigga what you expect
What you expect, watch you expect
I came from the gutter nigga what you expect
What you expect, watch you expect
Let it ride

[Verse 2]
You got it today don't get plucked tomorrow
Nothing held back when I get stuck in my zone
Gon' need a lot of luck so call Chuch Pagano
How I do it, ha, if I know
I'm just tryna make it so just save it like it's sacred
Take em out the game like two flagrant situations
Persuasive with the language think I'm starting to make em angry
Understand the circumstances right before you go and play me
Hello baby, if she go then I go
Nice thighs and five-five like Cinco de Mayo
Keep my circle small three bro's in my phone
We sacrifice cause if the team on then I'm on
It's Battles, let it ride

[Hook]
I came from the gutter nigga what you expect
What you expect, watch you expect
I came from the gutter nigga what you expect
What you expect, watch you expect
Let it ride
