(Pre-Hook)

Say you got a problem
But we you know you ain’t got no problem
Cause you don’t want them problems
Cause you know that we resolve em baby
Eyes and them lips, Thighs and them hips
Hands in the air you feeling this shit huh
You know I got them hits
They want me to miss
Yo girl she want the dick
She can’t get a kiss
You niggas talking shit
Miss me with that shit
You niggas make a lot of noise
Thoing Thoing Thoing Thoing

(Verse 2 – Mark Battles)

It’s Fly America

Yo these niggas make a lot of noise
Put in work but I’m not employed
Every beat going to get destroyed, freak out in Illinois
Usually only like girls but she love the boy
Mr. Vasi King
So if you ain’t reppin’ 3’s then it’s not a thing
Call me M. L. King cause I got a dream
I just popped up on the scene nigga, Bada Bing
Or Bada Boom
A few shows, couple hoes and a lot of rooms
And don’t you act surprised how I gotta do em
If he said it better meaning cause we ridin’ to em
Uhhh, tell that nigga slow down
If you didn’t know it then you better know now
Like the temp in September cause it’s about to go down
Put them gloves up, we can go 4 rounds nigga


(Hook)
