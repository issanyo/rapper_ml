[Intro]
It's Fly America

[Verse 1]
When I look up in the mirror Is see the greatest man alive
City full of crime it was hard to survive
Defeated all the odds cause I never had a job
But now before I hit the stage you got to give me five
Plus travel, a couple rooms and what have you
My bafoons is nuts backwards, they stun you
What that gun do for moon for them fools
Bang hammers like Judge Mathis
Such a cold cold world, She ain't mine nigga she just an old girl
She following the team the regime is so thorough
Think the same as Pinky Brain nigga want the whole world
It's 3's up 'till they ease up, Give me some food in the booth I don't need much
I'm in the coop getting loose with your dream slut
She said she love a nigga cause I'm clean cut

[Hook]
Please tell me what they want, what they want
What they want, what they really want from me
Please tell me what they want, what they want
What they want, what they really want from me
And now I'm in the game, the say "will he stay the same?"
Yeah nigga I'll never change, yeah nigga I'll never change

[Verse 2]
Working while you burning with your bestie, hefty
Bag em up, tiffa trying to test me
Wesley, snipe a nigga quicker than Nestle yes we grinding for tomorrow and next week
Gretzky, skating on these niggas trying to check me
Grind all the time till it's palm trees and jet skis
One more thing till my team in the Espy's
Make room, pop up on the scene like Pepsi
3's up nigga want the credit like a Visa
Show up to the table share the bread like Jesus
We up, keep em coming back like a re-up
You can play the Family Guy I'm looking for Amela
Have you seen her? Follow the leader. I smoke a nigga like sativa
You're a dreamer and my demeanor is one of a kind you will never get a sequel I don't see it equal
(It's Battles)

[Hook]
Please tell me what they want, what they want
What they want, what they really want from me
Please tell me what they want, what they want
What they want, what they really want from me
And now I'm in the game, the say "will he stay the same?"
Yeah nigga I'll never change, yeah nigga I'll never change

[Outro]
It's fly america right
3's up
Give me success or give me death that's what we live by
Fly high or get flown over
Battles
