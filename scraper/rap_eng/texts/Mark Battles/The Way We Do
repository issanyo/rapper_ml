[Chorus]
I say we just do it fine yea getting by on the basics
Dealing with some issues glad that we made it
Cheers to the villa smiles on the faces
Ain’t nothing wrong with a little celebrating
Oh oh oh ain't nothing wrong this is the way
We do do do this is the way we this is the way we

[Verse 1]
Everybody talking shit i know you notice something
Yea i notice when you notice it was from my only source
Why they talk shit too though i thought we were close homies
Where the fuck you were at in the coldest moments
Friends act the fakest when they see you passing greatness
Now my mama want to kill me results in assassination
Living fast with no patients mad because we snacking places
Was back in dine with no payments thinking I’m finally feeling famous
You can see the tension in their eyes lies in the worst coming
Quick to judge you by your colour my mind is just more focus
Lead by example handle yours with door open
Pay attention to my drive until you can’t afford to focus

[Chorus]
We just do it fine yea getting by on the basics
Dealing with some issues glad that we made it
Cheers to the villa smiles on the faces
Ain’t nothing wrong with a little celebrating
Oh oh oh ain't nothing wrong this is the way
We do do do this is the way we this is the way we

[Verse  2]
It's the way we do the way we go
Summer spring or snow I’m a make it grow
Room full of actors you just play your role
Lest us here with nothing now we never letting go
Slow down you can’t rush it
Unless you rep the trees by any means i don’t trust it
I wanted i needed all i promise i ain’t budging
Refuse to stop the hustling until my people get some justice
Lying to the public my mama tell me to discuss it
Why the pass do we were pissing in the bucket
Living in destruction now the mission is to crush it
Working too hard have to put an end to the suffering

[Chorus]
We just do it fine yea getting by on the basics
Dealing with some issues glad that we made it
Cheers to the villa smiles on the faces
Ain’t nothing wrong with a little celebrating
Oh oh oh ain't nothing wrong this is the way
We do do do this is the way we this is the way we
