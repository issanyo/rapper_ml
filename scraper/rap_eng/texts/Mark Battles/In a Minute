[Verse 1]
Yo Yo
I just need you to understand me, you know
Life be kinda’ hard on the nigga I ain’t lying
But ain’t a man in the world that’s gonna stop me from trying
Got a boy and two girls and I hate to see ‘em crying
So it ain’t about that money then I’m hardly be replying
Keep your silent look, west side  [?]
Know my city very well
Now they say no fairy tale was homicides is scary hell
Know some niggas that they’ll leave you lookin’ like a Jheri curl
Very [?], young [?] we rap out [?]
It’s really sick the place you grow we’re getting very [?]
Never had it [?] but I’m supposed to share?
I can’t call it fair
But I call it life

All my bus is going rocky ‘til we all get right
Always think before you speak that’s just some great advice
I kiss my daughter on the cheek and then I say goodnight
I gonna take a flight, they sure they got me piss
Cause even coming home rich can’t buy back what I miss
I regret that, you know how it feel when the world can’t hear your best rap
Your girl don’t never text back
Cause you caught up in a sex trap
[?] The hoses with it so we make you wanna x that
Just a setback for a come back
All this rap shit, well I [?] that
This niggas dance for money now tell me where in the world is that
I hit the road for fifty shows in two months flat

[Hook]
I ain’t got time for these niggas
(I ain’t got time for this niggas)
[?] Hold it down if you’re [?]
(hold it down)
Never was it is, I’ma grind just to get it
(I’ma grind)
If you keep it real, we gonna make it in a minute. Minute
(we gonna make it in minute)
I ain’t got time for these niggas
(I ain’t got time for this niggas)
[?] Hold it down if you’re [?]
(hold it down hold it down)
Never was it is, I’ma grind just to get it
If you keep it real, we gonna make it in a minute
Minute (minute)

[Verse 2]
Grow up with no father figure
Everything I needed though it’s what I got my mama did it
[?] is my bro be right here like a Honda Civic
Told my nigga it’s time to get it
Buckle up ‘tis got a limit

I don’t believe in second place
And a nigga ain’t your nigga he can laugh right in your face
Keep your smile I’m feeling great, because god don’t make mistakes
I’m like a year around school
I don’t believe in breaks
Full straight through
Barely had enough but see we may do
Hey you, learn to love yourself and always stay true
(always stay true)
I’m thankful

[Hook]
I ain’t got time for these niggas
(I ain’t got time for this niggas)
[?] Hold it down if you’re [?]

Never was it is, I’ma grind just to get it
(I’ma grind)
If you keep it real, we gonna make it in a minute. Minute
(we gonna make it in minute)
I ain’t got time for these niggas
(I ain’t got time)
[?] Hold it down if you’re [?]
(hold it down hold it down)
Never was it is, we gonna grind just to get it
If you keep it real, we gonna make it in a minute
Minute (minute)
