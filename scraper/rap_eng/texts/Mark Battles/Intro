[Hook] x2
As I lay me down and I go to sleep
If I don't wake I pray the lord my soul to keep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
I pray the lord my soul to keep

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
They always told me I ain't have it all
I leave them leaking like secretions from the vaginal
Went to a party up in Venus and we had a ball
Then I got nervous and asked Jesus when he plan to call
I'm tryna get it all Spring, Summer, Winter, Fall
4 of us attending y'all wonder who gon' win it dawg
Get up off genitals
What I do to beats the same thing as when I'm in the stall
Wasn't with me through the fog quit acting like we're friends and all
Mirror Mirror on the wall who's time is it
We up next and now I see a new line of chicks
Success in due time I'll credit it to my crew grind
My core fans is like coke heads, got them fiending for a few lines
Buff it till my shoe shine nothing like the old kind
Gonna make it there in no time
And I don't need a cosign
I'm on a mission I'll say
Killing beat after beat don't know how many I'll slay
I'm on a rampage so stand safe don't get in my way
It's tough I even had to tell time to give me my space
Yippie kay yay uhm don't get carried away
Spared the first day probably would get married today
Soon as my Kardashian you would swear I'm Kanye
Change my name to Coach Battles I ain't come here to play
Running for days walk in public nothing but A's
Make you think I got wonderful grades
Nothing to say
Battles
