[Intro]
Imma be honest
Usually I keep my mouth shut
When it comes to stuff like this
Cause I just feel like
You know people real sensitive but I
I gotta let it out

[Verse]
I just wanna live, we just wanna live
Discussions about justice but they out here killing kids
Obama's just a puppet he can't tell it how it is
Building billion dollar jets but ain't no food up in our fridge
This is crazy, we caught up in the system
To me it ain't no black and white
It's the killer and the victim
Sold ome drugs to ourselves please tell me what's the difference?
Cause my nigga killed my nigga and I swear to God I miss him
We all people quit tryna to divide us man, we all equal
All this fighting, all this fussing riot and cussing
Fires going up in stores, crashing like it's nothing
This is crazy, ain't we civilized ?
Seem like our thoughts are all minimized
This how I feel Inside
Look up to the sky that's how I deal with God
Got me praying every hour
Can't do much about it so I'm feeling like a coward
I just asks for strength and a little healing power
Cause we fed up with the leaders, think they tryna live without us
You think we stupid, must think we useless, it's so confusing
Home of the free they ain't stealing that, we equal, but I see you didn't mention that you get to kill my people
In the system overdosing on the needle (Huh)
Had it all planned out, hope we wouldn't see you huh?
Hope we wouldn't see you huh?
Hasta la vista, wouldn't wanna be you huh?
That's how they treat us we outcasted
All the pain and the struggle we outlasted
And we never going down
Take a bullet with a smile ain't no fathers in the wild
Since a child I've been grinding, I ain't had no guidance
Wonder why we riot? Moment of silence
Let's give a moment of silence for everybody we loss
We just tired, oh so tired
We just tired
All the fighting, all the hatred
Swear to God one day we gonna make it
We gonna make it

[Outro]
This ain't no black or white thing (Not at all)
This ain't no race thing (Not at all)
We all American, we all people
We gotta come together, before it's too late (Yeah)
It's Fly America
