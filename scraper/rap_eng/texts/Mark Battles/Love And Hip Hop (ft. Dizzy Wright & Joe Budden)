[Chorus: Mark Battles]
It's like as soon as you see me, I always gotta go
Armani never changed, it's the same as befo'
Tat' my name on you just to let them niggas kno'
That the thang is still mine, even when I'm on the road
Love and Hip Hop
That's Love and Hip Hop
That's Love and Hip Hop
That's Love and Hip Hop

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
Grind till I'm collapsin, anything to make it happen
Even when she out I know she coming home to daddy
And when I'm on the road, send me flicks to keep me happy
Let me get it anywhere, even in the back seat
Nasty, but only when she gotta be
Always keep it solid cause I know that you will ride for me
Say you proud of me cause I took us out of poverty
And joined the other side of the economy but modestly
Hold me down like you been doin'
Anything we run into, we can get through it
This music my life, I gotta stick to it
In time for a night, I gotta get movin
Wifey, but I ain't have to put a ring on it
I just put you on my song and let you sing on it
Message my girl like a lame homie
I ain't sweating cause her body got my name on it

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Mark Battles]
Like life, it must be nice
And If I, messed up once, would you trust me twice?
And for the, rest of months, would you love me right?
Despite the fact Ion' get to hit you up some nights, right
Like life, it must be nice
And If I, messed up once, could you trust me twice?
And for the, rest of months, would you love me right?
Despite the fact Ion' get to hit you up some nights, right

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Yeah yeah
Show me true passion
I'm relaxin in this cabin and I'm dabbin
Smilin', laughin' to myself, how it all happened
Imagine the aftermath after the madness
I'm loving the way that we sticking together right
This better life ain't nothing without Ms. Wright
And I hold it down, and you shut me down
When you know you ain't being right
I try to tell her things, we in different lanes
You, finna miss the train I ain't got time to be playin'
I told her before I knew I would know her
Things was moving a little slower, now they picked up
Now I'm ready to see where it gets us
But it's all lies against us
See you changing but I guess that comes with being famous
Love and hip hop..

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
She gon' miss me when I'm gone
Kiss her on her forehead and tell her I won’t be long
She share me with the world, I gotta go and perform
But our bond is strong enough for us to weather any storm
I never do her wrong, no reason for her to ever think the worst of
She cool with being second to my first love
Uh, gotta love the way that she react
Cause for her my passion’s a aphrodisiac
City to city first class, I even fly her in
Tell her pick her favorite city, we’ll try it again
Back by popular demand
No bags, we can shop when you land
Love how you rock with yo man
Love

[Chorus]
