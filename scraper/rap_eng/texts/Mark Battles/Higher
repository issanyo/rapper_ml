My, my, my as the world spins
12.21 is when they say the world ends
Well you better hope so, cause if it don’t bro
2013 we gone start a world trend
Girlfriends and they mama screaming
Oh my, she kinda geekin, and she claim she a Christian
But her draws missing, I’m tryna find a reason
Oh I’m no kind of deacon, that really ain’t my interest
More like a judge put you away in one sentence
Midwest henchman, and oh, did I mention?
We are much different, so keep your distance
I’m Michael Jordan, you’re Jordan Farmar
Speeding through the race, steady pace, just had a hard start
And here comes the hard part
Spitting so much flame, you ain’t seen this since Charizard
Ash better catch em all, going by separate laws
The victim once I enter, you the winner cause you next to fall
Get it, I don’t brag, I can’t afford to
Y’all hate your lives, I wake up fine cause I’m more true
Qrst, cause I come before you
Everybody don’t got it, honest, it’s just a core few
Oh do I bore you? Ain’t all about that weed and liquor
Y’all seeming bitter about as real as a jesus picture
Yeah, see I’ma show you clowns cause I broke you down
I’ma fold you now, like a roll of new towels
Gotta Goku style and my whole crew wild
Better hope you find, a better go to sound
Cause my flow grew now, when the tofu child
It’s nasty, and I’m the author
So discrete, about to hit my peak like a stalker
Peek a boo, I’m here, wow, and it’s my year pal
God is all I fear now, y’all just along for the ride John Deer style
And I bet they cheer now, and they gonna cheer loud
They used to boo me, strangers claim they knew me
Been on tour for few weeks, now girls say I’m unique
Bout my paper loose leaf, I only got a few sheets
Labels just like who he, I’m just tryna do me
Remain having honor, your like four quarters
You a change for a dollar, it’s Battles
It’s fly America, it’s fly America
