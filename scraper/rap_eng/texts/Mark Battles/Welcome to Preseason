Hey there you, shattered in a thousand pieces
Weeping in the darkest night

[Mark Battles]
Welcome to preseason
We got so much to discuss in such a short time
I don't want to waste these precious moments
Those who are unfamiliar
Will soon be familiar
It's Fly-America

[Verse: Mark Battles]
Uh, did all the things that they said I wouldn't (I wouldn't)
I held it down when they said I couldn't
Out on the road baby's at home I gotta keep it pushing
Why you dealing with them niggas man they kinda crooked (they my niggas though)
What's life without mistakes (right)
Working night and day until I'm wiping out the greats (right)
I'm Tyson house the tiger out
Icing out the cakes
No debate, flow rare like I'm knifing down the steak
And it's great, wait, what's a man to you
They should know that taking over's what I plan to do
It's what you plan to stop
Will you take a chance or not
Gimme 3k for a feature Imma make you hot (Imma make you hot)
No cops this lil bastard came to take the spot
My time on my watch you better get a clock
God, who knew that would work (work)
I was too cool for school but too bad for church (church)
This new class could work if we move passed the purp
Some old this and same old that
Changed those stats, naw nigga you can't go back
Rain on that, I'm leaning like a kangol hat
Ayo Jack, releasing facts you should stay and cherish
Rap it up like Aids awareness
Imma lay the merits
Never ? meet her parents then I pass to Derek
I'm not embarrassed so don't spare bro I had to share it
This life I live, my lord, this life I live
Sitting back reminiscing on the things I did
12 hours in the booth can I bring my kid
Kinda pissed cuz if not then I can't come
Stress chasing my daily but daddy can't run
All my ex's is crazy hate when I have fun
Mad that I'm living my dream like you ain't have one
This sound, this sound dumb if you ask me
Hate me now, but love me last week
Ya main thang is my past freak my ? ?
I had her dripping while she ride it like a gas leak
The fast sleep then it's back to the paper
Triple way player you ain't never did it major
Indiana kid and they treat me like a pacer
I should charge by the acre
Ask around for any takers (It's Battles)
