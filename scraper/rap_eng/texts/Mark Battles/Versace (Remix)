Versace Versace, I'm mean as Nazi
Can't no one come stop me
Frontin' like you so tough
But I'm dicin' em up, you would think that is Yahtzee
I roll through the city
These girls on my Jimmy like Drake in Degrassi
They actually like me, I'm nasty, bukkake
We crashin' the lobby
This rappin's a hobby, I'm spittin' wasabi
I live in the Rockies with different com-padres
Women beside me that's into pilates
They cleaner than Oxy, I'm sick of the copies
Whoa whoa, just calm down
I'm the bomb now, think Saddam brown
I found a new crowd for my hot sound
"Mom, wow, it's gon' take us to a high ground"
Time out, take it up
Starin' at 'em like "Hater what? Hater what?"
Shake 'em up, break 'em up just to make a buck
Steak for lunch, now I'm goin' hard for the sake of us
It's F.A., doin' well so to Hell what the rest say
Big year, gon' be here for a decade
Inside all leather like a sex slave, uh
I'm good and she young
I grew up a bum now I'm boomin' a ton
She choosin' the rum but the cutest of ones
Is usin' that tongue, to do it for fun
Ha, you get it, I won it
You win it, I done it like Emmitt, I run it
You rappers is supper so sit in my stomach
Or finish your plummet, the difference is nothin'

It's Battles, it's Battles
