[Intro: Mark Battles]
How you expecting to make the right moves, when you surrounded by the wrong people?
Cut those niggas out your life man, I did
It's pretty obvious we on a mission
Threes up

[Hook: Mark Battles]
I wouldn't mind, a hundred million, and like 20, for my children
I wouldn't mind, a couple houses, with the marble, in the ceilings
I wouldn't mind, a few cars, just to show you how I'm feeling
I wouldn't mind (I wouldn't mind, no)

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
You still worshiping money, to me it's kinda funny
On the real, you can have that shit
Long as my son and my daughters go to school and do cool
And they pass that shit
I'm a dad that's it, with a badass chick
Rolling about a 100 in a fast ass whip
Vasi on the rise better hashtag quick
Lil bro joined the team, now they mad at Ric
Don't forget
Don't forget where you came from
Tony Vasi the name hun
Rep the team with my day ones
Talking shit, we don't say much, stop it
Don't get about a pocket
All threes like I'm playing for the Rockets
Call me, probably laying in the goddess
Worked hard and I'm staying for the profits
Okay, I'm being modest
Lately I'm feeling like the best, "No I.D." got me chilling in the west
Nap town finally getting our respect
317 we 'gone make it in a sec
Found all the dots, I'm just making them connect
Faced death twice I ain't worried about a threat
Came from the mud, I ain't seen nothing yet
Bad, anything I say I mean, she love me
Good D like Draymond Green
We thug deep, hundred shows just to pay my team
World threw me in the jungle, and I came out clean (y'all know me)

[Hook: Mark Battles]
I wouldn't mind, a hundred million, and like 20, for my children
I wouldn't mind, a couple houses, with the marble, in the ceilings
I wouldn't mind, a few cars, just to show you how I'm feeling
I wouldn't mind (I wouldn't mind, no)

[Verse 2: Ric Vasi]
Steady finnessing, these bitches and niggas gonna hate you, I'm better than ever
I never could settle for anything less than a medal
Invested myself and adjusted my schedule (ha ha)
In love with this [?], in love with this cash, and in love with this paper
Passing you up on my way up, I lay up and fuck them vacations
Fuck a bitch nigga, they don't want to see you make it
Shit, I got the people waiting
Fuck this shit up like it's renovation
We was in the basement, getting stimulated
Skip through you niggas like simulation
I'll take your bitch and I penetrate it
Ayo, my nigga, you real FA
Steady finesse and I demonstrate it
Bitch I been a playa, say I'm the one like I'm in the matrix
Come at my Vasis, them killas waiting
I be sending vapors through you ventilations

[Hook: Mark Battles]
I wouldn't mind, a hundred million, and like 20, for my children
I wouldn't mind, a couple houses, with the marble, in the ceilings
I wouldn't mind, a few cars, just to show you how I'm feeling
I wouldn't mind (I wouldn't mind, no)

I wouldn't mind, a hundred million, and like 20, for my children
I wouldn't mind, a couple houses, with the marble, in the ceilings
I wouldn't mind, a few cars, just to show you how I'm feeling
I wouldn't mind (I wouldn't mind, no)

[Outro]
It's Fly America
Threes up
