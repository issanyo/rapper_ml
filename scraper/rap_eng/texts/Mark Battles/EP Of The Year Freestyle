[Verse]
I'm feeling so fortunate
Don't be spooked, when you check the booth I left a corpse in it
Back to having fun your run is done stick a fork in it
My niggas might come around robbin' like a tournament
I want the meal when I order it
Start to see you shine they wanna hang like an ornament
Torture it, sonning all these niggas need an orphanage
These guys is all beats and choruses they forcing it
I got the shit that cook
Paypal to Coach K you wanna get that book
She kept asking me to hit that look
Came to do the whole house like a big bad wolf
We mobbin' deep when I ride through the city
And it can get real ugly it don't gotta be pretty
Imma get this bitch crackin' like Bobby and Whitney
Nigga, leave your head red like Yatchy and Trippie, pockets is iffy
So it's back to the hustling
OG Jelly came with the load like he buffering
One stroke had your girl screaming like she suffering
World full of fakes understand what you up against
I'm the type to make a gay girl turn straight
Worst case, third base on a first date
My new shit groundbreaking like an earthquake
Face to face with the greats I'll murk Drake
That's my idol, I ain't hating I'm just stating facts
Pray to God he don't get mad cause I'll take it back
I'm trying to do a track with homie if you cool with that
But if he hit me with a back to back I'm shooting back
That's a proven fact, like me cause I'm cute and black
Model bitch with double D's got me boobie trapped
What can I do with that?
10K up in the Louis sac
You want your dogs to stay down then feed em all Scooby snacks
Everybody gotta eat we all need a piece
Watch the ones who talk the most cause they seen the least
Swear to God I'm like a God yo I need a Preist
Been heating up next to cook I just needed greace

[Outro]
It's Battles!
It's Fly America
Go get that Fortunate EP, bitch!
