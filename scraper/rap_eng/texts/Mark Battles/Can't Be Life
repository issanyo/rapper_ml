[Hook:]
This can't be life, this can't be life
Mommas crying, kids are dying, this can't be right [x2]
All this pain, all this pain
And they just ignore us like it's all the same
This can't be life, this can't be life
All this pain, this can't be right

[Verse 1:]
We was made to fight
Love my moms cause she raised me right
I always said I'd be the famous type
Newest clothes and the latest Nikes
And I prayed at night, asking God will He change my life
Will He change my life, will He change my life
What we supposed to do? Don't notice nothing till it's close to you
Every night I'm eating frozen food
Skip the channels where they show the news cause we don't know the rules
But, I've seen worse things
My cousin got killed at thirteen
Shot in the head, dropped and he dead
Ain't it crazy, that his mom still look at him like he a baby
And now he gone, tear after tear gotta fight for the strong
Now he rest in peace, had to put him in the song
How you supposed to move on, said we gotta move on
I just pray we live long

[Hook:]
This can't be life, this can't be life
Mommas crying, kids are dying, this can't be right [x2]
All this pain, all this pain
And they just ignore us like it's all the same
This can't be life, this can't be life
All this pain, this can't be right



Please, please...
