Yeah, they said
They said, they said “get it out”
Yeah, let’s get it out
Yeah

Am I living up to the expectations?
Voices in my mind say I’ll never make it
Voices on the outside be saying the same shit
The voices on the inside practicing imitation
Thinking ‘bout integration, thinking ‘bout inner patience
Talking about expansion, thinking ‘bout limitations
Thinking ‘bout carrying out a death or death situation
Thinking I let the piece rain on me like meditation
I think my friends getting sick of waiting
Cause I have trouble resonating with this generation
The mustang is the only thing lit I’m claiming
Got me checking the vin number for vindication
Fuck it, figure it out while I’m getting wasted
Just want my family to feel some celebrations
If I pay for everyone will it be better tasting?
But everything ain’t on the house when it needs renovations
The roof might cave in, so who replacing?
I’m in the basement, the roof is pavement
That’s kind of difficult to ignore
But I guess it’s ironic, my ceiling is just everyone’s floor
Maybe I just get to myself
And feel like to learn, I have to lessen myself
Even if I’m on a roll, I could fail with a B
Anything short of a hunnet is a failure to me
I can’t be next to a desk
I confess imma mess, I progress and regress
I’m just tryna’ be the best of the best
Wondering if I have it in me like a pregnancy test And everyone like “you nice, you stay killing the beat”
So I just store credit like forgetting receipts
And everybody wanna’ aid me, they can get it for free
But bloods thicker than water, for them I’ll get a disease
Fuck it, I’ll get it wit ease, for them I’ll have to reroute
For them, I’ll come packed with nine ‘fore I come pack out a house
So if riding in my passenger and that seat is filled
Just know that y’all always gon’ have a fuckin’ seat in my will but
The uneasiness
Of me putting everything that I got into something that I’m believing in
And it falling flat, not standing up, no comedians
Made a young boy have to get out all of my grievances

It get hard tryna’ chase this shit
But a nigga so close I can taste this shit
Now you wanna’ come around and I hate that shit
All this synthetic love really make me sick
Yo this can’t be it, I’m tryna’ reach my dreams
I don’t need much but I need my team
Everything getting clearer, I don’t need Visine
Vasi Kings, couple flings tryna’ be my queen
That’s life right?
But would you sell your soul for the right price?
Man I’m feeling boxed in like it’s fight night
Yo what’s your life like? And what’s your fight like?
This shit killing me
I got the ability but claiming they ain’t feeling me
I know what it really be
They don’t wanna’ see me win
Damn

Damn
They say “get it out”
Fuck it right, let’s get it out
Made a young boy want to air out all of his grievances
