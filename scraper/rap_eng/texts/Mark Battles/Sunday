[Intro]
What's fly America?
3's up

[Verse]
Say she love me but she not for real
Save that talk for Dr. Phil
You gotta chill
I'm on my grind we got a lot to build
Pride of steel
My people rose from them cotton fields
Five or better for a show
And that's without a deal
Still, I'm all about progression
Ain't even made Freshman
But I'm callin' out the veterans
Hit the booth and start dogging out the sessions
I don't call my fans' haters they just yawnin' out of preference
Notice things that they don't get to see
While you calling her queen she trying to get to me
She got the sticky-sweet I call her Rice Krispie Treat
I think I met her out in Boston at the Middle East
Livin' a lie so we straight wildin'
My homies throwing up the 3's like Ray Allen
The cake palace so you know a nigga stay smilin'
But I'll snatch you out the game if you play lousy (nigga)
If you ain't first then you last
Stop flirtin' with trash, she just thirstin' for cash
Sundays I would sit in church with a pad
That's why I rap like a god on every verse that I smash
Just ask, I don't believe in giving up
'Till every human being can eat, I ain't did enough (I ain't did enough)
You say you do it big, I'm on some bigger stuff
By the way I see it, you ain't doin' much
It's Battles
