[Intro]
I'm done waitin' and that's on everything I love. 2018 ain't gonna be about nothing else, just Vasi shit. Y'all niggas think I'm playin' okay

[Verse]
All the weak niggas, I'ma send em to y'all
I'm here to save the game like a memory card
Don't fall for the gimmicks, they pretend to be hard
And I'm really from the gutter bitch, 3s if you fuck with it
All my hoes the sluttiest, all my shows the chubbiest
Barely make enough to live so all my bros is hustlin'
Groupies really think I'm rich, I swear that's just the funniest
Bad little honey dip, butt, tits, your tummy fixed
Vasi Gang captain, really rappin' on some mummy shit
All them other niggas I ate? Weak, I worked two months on this
Get it? Over heads like projectors
Save me with the lectures, raise the baby under pressure
I ain't Robert Hall the first, poppin' off a verse, fans coppin' all the merch
Flow so godly need to drop me off at church, I really hope it works
Marco what's the deal-ly, he get silly off the perks
When my friends left, I got chilly on this Earth
New bitch look like T-Boz, Adidas and some knee-highs
Made it on my own, I stand alone like a Kiosk
Papa was a rollin' stone, never came to see us
Everybody throwing 3s, you dweebs wanna be us
It's time for the re-ups, done fightin' over peanuts
It ain't no payments for the clean ups, I want it all, I gotta have it all
I'm back y'all, yo why these lousy niggas hatin'? Tell 'em back off
I hear em barkin' but they pussies like Cat-Dog
And quit callin' your shit rap if you don't rap, dog
One of the greatest alive, this ain't no accident
Fans hear my anthems and they kneel like Kaepernick
Relax 'fore that MAC get to airin' on some Packer shit
Smash and tell her pack her shit, I'm back up on my rapper shit
And I'm sick of all the cheap talkin'
Bitch, I'm livin' out a dream, I feel like I'm sleep walkin'
But I stay up on my grind so I don't sleep often
Attention seekin' for no reason, better stay cautious
Remain flawless, this is mine, I'ma claim all this
I can't call it, money good but the pain awful
You can't pause it, we live in action
And only God can grasp it, huh, that's how it happens

[Outro]
3's
It's Fly America
3's up
