[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Mark Battles]
Niggas can't stop my team from eating
Niggas tryna roll up on you creeping
Niggas can't stop the kid from breathing
Niggas can't stop the kid from dreaming
Hard times streets, that's where I'm from
Dark vibes streets, that's where I'm from
Hard knock life, that's where I'm from (Yo)
Cold nights gone, that's where I'm from, I'm from

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
She said, "I love you baby," and I wonder why
Feelin' hopeless, losin' focus, should I give up or try? (cry)
I know God is real, but why He let my brother die
My heart went cold, it took my soul to watch my mother cry
But I'm the man now, I gotta go and get it
Yo' shout out Young one, that's my nigga, man we co-dependent
Anytime I make a move, my bro be rollin' with it
And every nigga, ain't your nigga, hope you know the difference
It's been a while now 'cause my life is changin'
Pricey payments, nights in Vegas, switch the flight arrangements
Don't say you love me baby, that shit make me angry
'Cause every time it felt like love that's when they left me hangin'
Hmm, I'm writin' music to reduce pain
I'm from a city where struggle teach you a few things
Fly America, Vasi League, we the new gang
Them niggas robbin' like Blac Chyna and Bruce Wayne
Let's get it poppin', they still doubtin' a few things
I'm mobbin' with my Day 1s, no new names
I ain't never seen the truth change (people change)

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Niggas can't stop my team from eating
Niggas tryna roll up on you creeping
Niggas can't stop the kid from breathing
Niggas can't stop the kid from dreaming
Hard times streets, that's where I'm from
Dark vibes streets that's where I'm from
Hard knock life, that's where I'm from
Cold nights gone, that's where I'm from, I'm from

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
Was tryna find time, never mind 'cause time flies
I'm here for 'hellos', no 'hell nos' or 'bye-byes'
I'm on the good vibes the rest of my life
The pressure compresses depression, I was stressin' at night
The lessons are blessings, respect it, don't you question the fight
You may fear there's nothin left until you step to the right
Switch up the game plan, tryna stay the same man
Leave the way I came man

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Niggas can't stop my team from leading
Niggas tryna roll up on you creeping
Niggas can't stop the kid from breathing
Niggas can't stop the kid from dreaming
Hard times streets, that's where I'm from
Dark vibes streets that's where I'm from
Hard knock life, that's where I'm from
Cold nights gone, that's where I'm from, I'm from
