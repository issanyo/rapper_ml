Bet you start mumbling now
You say luck, I say [?], new wave up, my play next
Make the card dash like Kanye West
Yes, niggas better try their best
Four days late on a Friday text
[?] make this make it [?] stress
Turn up on your work like a bad reflex
I ain’t try’na play with y’all
No thing, get the gang involved
No bang but we came to brawl
Let’s hang got the chains withdraws
Their fate won’t change that way

Nicknamed the hoover [?]
He blew the tip and sew the chip

Whole squad go [?] like a [?]
Oh god my gosh [?]

Name a city you all stayed that we run at
[?] lame lame got a big mouth hush that whoa!

[?] game that her son is better
Forget to use logic when they under pressure
So I’m going at ‘em, uncle faster
I give [?] to crush the letters
Nigga made a way out the bunch of Nevers
He’s got an uncle and they never met ‘em
Rest in peace [?] I see you will have it
Started it off great I’ll make you a legend
Classes in this session I'll teach you a lesson
Want it all now when it’s making me reckless
Mark whoever first cause I hate to be second
Surprise I quit we made it I’m destined
Hundred thousand likes still making me breakfast
To me a dream girl is an 8 out of 7
Won’t fall out gotta keep it together

[Hook]
