[Intro]
It's Fly America
Yeah, Yeah

[Hook: Myah Evans]
This is for the ones who felt [?]
This is for the ones who need [?]
This is for the ones who [?]
This is for everyone who wants who [?] burn it up and change it
And live with no regrets
So put your lighters up (oh, oh)
Put your lighters up (oh, oh) (x5)

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
One time for my homies that ain't here no more
But we know you lookin' down so I love you for it
And I'm focused all the time, I'm tryna open doors
Life is hard for everybody it ain't only yours
So you gotta get it while you can
You really changed my life, yo I swear I love my fans
Like, two years ago I was living in a van
Now it's tour dates in France
Man, we really got a chance

[Hook: Myah Evans]

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
Rest in peace to Carl, that's my lil bro
I made a promise we gon' get it, though livin' on all the minimals
In it to see the pinnacle, finish before the intervals
I left the world without a blemish but in critical
I ain't in the back but I'm close to the ending row
Lyrical since the umbilical, got me killin' em
My God, I know it's our time gotta be real wit' em
Throw them 3s
Fly America you gotta deal wit' em
We ain't stopping no time soon
Headed for the stars about to go to the moon
Always dwelling on the past, don't re-open the wounds
Because only God can judge, ain't got nothing to prove

[Hook: Myah Evans]

"Play this record as frequently as possible."

[Verse 3: Mark Battles]
I'm not a fan of the gossip
Grew up in a land full of goblins
Don't stand for no nonsense
Demand a deposit
The plan is the profit
Will you lend a hand to man and his problems?
Get 'em, yo I got 'em
Gunnin' cause we coming from the bottom
I just keep it real while these niggas playing possum
Rest in peace to Carl, '06 is when we lost him
Momma had us cautious
Raised like some bosses
J's and a walkman
A slave to the losses
Behave like it's Auschwitz
Catch me in the office
No Yes Men around, I'm already feeling awesome
I'm in the lead when they sprinting and I'm jogging
Welcome to the lawless, home is what I call it
Milk is $4.50 so it's water in them Frosted
Flakes, wasn't great, don't mistake me for a darling
I'm a man, I ain't even saying I'm the hardest
Coming for it all so I'ma have to beg your pardon
It's Marcus, nigga
(laughs)
My name ain't even Marcus
I just said it cause it rhymed
Battles

[Outro]
Uh
3s up
Ye-yeah (x2)
It's Fly America (x2)
Fly high or get flown over, nigga you already know what's up
