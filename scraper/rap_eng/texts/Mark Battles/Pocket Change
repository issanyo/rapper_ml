[Intro: Derek Luh]
Yeah, 13th
Real shit
What you, what you knowing lil boy?
Look...

[Verse 1: Derek Luh]
Still ain't playing when I say the labels pay me enough
Let's take it back to the faggots who ain't banging my cuts
What? The band need some aid? I think these gauze is enough
An ace with the racks, my joints hardly get touched
I used to fight back home, one on one and get jumped
My older homie told me "you gonna show some pride with them lumps"
A man handle what he can, keep it private and tucked
The man handed you a gift, has you been writing or what?
I understand you want this shit, then you best tighten it up
I always wanted checks from the right checks but it's tough
It ain't easy when them Yeezy suede ostrich odds
D might just do it and take them Adidas

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
Million dollar women, low budget spending
Life segregated, keep you niggas at a distance
Who you think you kidding? Purring like a baby cat
It's the nigga with the crazy raps, pray to God I make it back
They used to hate me, now they love me
She really wanna call me hubby
But I'm single like a dollar bill
Prompt, I ain't got time to chill
Grind, I ride for real, defined by a lot of skills
They all talk, so lately I be yawning
She drain my balls like Brady in the morning
I'm going in, these fools is enough
You niggas suck, like your boo-boo in the back of my truck

[Outro: Mark Battles]
What?
It's Battles nigga
Until September
Hahaha
It's Fly America
