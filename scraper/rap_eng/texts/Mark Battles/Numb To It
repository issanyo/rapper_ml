[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
Imagine being eight, and never feeling safe
My momma's crazy husband put a pistol to her face
He knocked me on the ground and told me that I had to wait
Gotta watch yo momma die cause her and Jesus got a date
It fill my heart with hate, never give in, so we take
Then when my brother passed, I wish I could've took his place
Wait, wait, you see, I ain't wanna live
Pain lies in death is what I knew as a kid
So afraid of love, to scared to ever cross that bridge
Not one to mess it up in these relationships I'm in
Not again, who the hell am I supossed to trust?
When he beat my mom for years and all she did was show him love?
All the tears they slowin' much, know my fears, I'm growin' up
Don't play me like a chump, I'mma get you what you want
I'm so tired of being weak, got a gun from down the streets
Said I'mma kill him in his sleep
Sixteen, I was a beast, twenty years I'll be released
Got it on my mom for weeks, I'mma take us both beneath

[Hook: Brittani Jenae]
I'm just numb, I'm just numb to it
I'm just numb to it
Don't wanna feel the pain no more
Oh, yeah
I'm just numb, call me numb to it
I'm just numb to it
Don't wanna feel the pain no more
Oh, yeah
I'm just numb to it

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
They said I was bein' dumb, really I just needed love
So I had my babies young, for you I'd fight the moon
And protect you from the sun
With daddy on your side, baby, you ain't gotta run
Stand strong, keep your head up
The world can be against us and I promise we won't lead up
But if they knock you down, just be proud, you can get up
Keep your hunger in that drive even when you fed up
(I love you)

[Hook: Brittani Jenae]
I'm just numb, I'm just numb to it
I'm just numb to it
Don't wanna feel the pain no more
Oh, yeah
I'm just numb, call me numb to it
I'm just numb to it
Don't wanna feel the pain no more
Oh, yeah

[Outro]
I'm just numb to it
I'm just numb to it
I'm just numb to it
