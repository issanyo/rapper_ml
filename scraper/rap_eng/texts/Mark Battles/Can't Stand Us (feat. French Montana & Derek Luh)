All my niggas be with it
All my niggas be with it
When we talk about it we did it
Them fast cars, we hit it
Fast money we spendin
Have yo main bitch trendin
Fly shit, we in it
If you start it off we finish
2doors tinted, glass roof that trunk
From that bottom floor we did it
With a penthouse off that dro
I got purple smoke in my lungs
Blue dot my bladder
All my niggas gon stunt
Yo dream bitch I done had er

Montana, Montana
Frenchie Montana
Nigga don’t make me do it
Fuck yo bitch on camera
Can’t you make some bacon with that Hannah Montana?
For all them all black diamonds and that black panorama

Montana, Montana
Frenchie Montana
You hit me on the cell set, let’s meet up in Atlanta
My life is like a movie so you better bring a camera

I pull up to the lot, they say it’s like a movie flow
This one or that one, I really don’t know who to pick
Can’t pronounce the name but I swear to God it’s movin quick
LV’s on my waist with a fresh pair of Louie slips
Who is this? Who is this? What you mean I mean it
Can’t come between my team, all the haters wanna touch the green that I see
Frenchie told me grind homie
Then you can go shine on em
How you get off with that 22
It’s kind of mind blowin

You had a pocket clock, it never changed faces
Watch it pop, steady play for changes
Killers cookin beats like crack up in yo basement
It’s amazing, so amazing, gold ring, my shit be bangin
Cop me a jerky from in still up on ya
We rollin in my ride like the top and she faded
I’m doin 105 in that 405, hit or take that 3rd street promenade
Made a hard left and I bust it wide
Now we outside of that waffle house
You on a house combo number 23
With a extra side of that gravy
