[Chorus]
Can you imagine life with no more rain?
No more dark times and no more pain?
Can you imagine life with no more hurtin'?
Wake up every day and shit is perfect

[Verse 1]
Can you picture life with no more struggle?
No more overtime or workin' doubles
And there wouldn't be no racism
'Cause nobody was born with hate in them
Can we have a time with no more evil?
No more lies to divide the people
And our leaders really strive to lead you
And when you die, they got a spot to keep you

[Chorus]
Can you imagine life with no more rain?
No more dark times and no more pain?
Can you imagine life with no more hurtin'?
Wake up every day and shit is perfect

[Verse 2]
I think we deserve it, quick call the nurses
My heart is burstin', I'm tired of hurtin'
The sky is burnin', my mind is searchin'
Let's find a purpose, at time's I'm nervous
It's so disturbin', just hope it's workin'
Fell close to worthless

[Chorus]
Can you imagine life with no more rain?
No more dark times and no more pain?
Can you imagine life with no more hurtin'?
Wake up every day and shit is perfect

[Outro]
Don't know if we deserve it, imagine
