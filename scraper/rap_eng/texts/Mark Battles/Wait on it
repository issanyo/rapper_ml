[Hook]
Make em wait on it
Make em wait
Why you worried bout the money that I make
Ever since a nigga started getting cake
Everybody got opinions all these niggas wanna hate
Make em wait on it
Make em wait
And I been reppin for my state
Yelling 317 out the gate
We just tryna make em wait can I see a better date
Make em wait on it

[Verse 1]
Telling me to wait up
Change up hell nah I'm the same one
Straight up I'm just repping where I came from
Won't find another realer cuz it ain't one
Coach K came to put me in the game
Since I started making plays it ain't ever been the same
Call up J Boogie
Chi city what's goodie
Pulling strings like woody
Couple thousand in my hoodie
Rookie if it ain't the threes I don't trust it
Hit up gold nugget throw a band like fuck it
Everywhere I go I'm the man I love it
Staying who I am being real got me buzzing
In the club about as deep as fifty
You creep we eat kapeesh watch the streets defend me
Minaj with mills like meek and nicki
I want the whole world you can keep the city
I'm gone

[Hook]

Make em wait
Imma make em wait on it
Make em wait (x2)
Yelling 317 out the gate (x3)

[Verse 2]
I'm the young Diddy in his prime
My niggas out they mind whole city full of crime, chill
I know her little pretty ass is fine
But she a stoner chick who sell that kitty for a dime, for real
100,000 sales so my team bragging
Have faith like I'm trying to get a C average
Whole game getting weak imma keep spazzing
They don't want it no more the way I let them have it
What? We ain't never worried
I can't help being real it's [?]
Cut your day short like February
And all that online flexing might get them buried
I knew it from the start you ain't have to call it
Too much money on the table man we grabbing all of it
Maserati blacked out like a alcoholic
I only speak to bosses meet me at the office

[Hook]
Make em wait
Imma make em wait on it
Make em wait (x2)
Yelling 317 out the gate (x3)

[Outro]
It's Fly America
North side, east side, west side, south side what's good?
317 till I die nigga
You better bring a army with you
