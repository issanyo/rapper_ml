[Hook]
Things aren't always gonna gonna be alright, ahh (x6)
When I was a kid, they say I dreamed too big
I'm just tryna live, and when I was small
I remembered I would have it all, and it might be tomorrow
And one of these days, and one of these days
And one of these days, and one of these days
And one of these days, and one of these days

[Verse 1]
I'm livin' life like my last days
Dumpin' out the ashtray of my past ways
And this is more than a cash chase
Movin' at a fast pace leave 'em with a bad taste
That's just how it goes
Still a boy ??? ??? ???
Me and Phil used to hoop with the Collins
It always amazed me to see they had a father
I was sort of crazy, do the same for my toddlers

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Haters think they hurting me, perfectly
But emergency, currency's always due when I murder beats
Til they feel to refer to me as the One but I currently
Hold the chair for eternity, get prepared for a surgery
Get despair and uncertainty, when they see where I'm headed
Remember that, it's a fact, if I ever said it
FA is the team, and you will never see us separate
Came in as a peasant and I'm leaving as a legend

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Uhm, what's a hand if you don't shake it
Huh, what's a chance if you don't take it
Look into the crowd and see a lot of happy faces
Expression like "Wow", they be staring in amazement
To me it's so amazing, mama said I'm so courageous
And that's the reason I'll make it
Haters so crazy, you see they always try to break me
I leave 'em lost like Vegas

[Hook]
Things aren't always gonna gonna be alright, ahh (x10)
When I was a kid, they say I dreamed too big
I'm just tryna live, and when I was small
I remembered I would have it all, and it might be tomorrow
And one of these days, and one of these days
And one of these days, and one of these days
And one of these days, and one of these days
