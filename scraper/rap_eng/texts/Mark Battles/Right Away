[Intro: Brittani Jenae]
Just tell me how you want it
Just tell me how you want it, babe
Just tell me how you want it
I'll be there right away

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
This that old school 90's shit
Rock the boat like Aaliyah when she ride the dick
Stop it quick, can't kiss 'cause I got a chick
Don't panic 'cause the car has a lot of tint
You ever heard of a riddle?
Give you somethin' ridiculous, the word in the middle
Stop (ouu) it might hurt you a little
(Uhh) But we can get through it get to it
It ain't nothin', bae had to put some [?]
And I know that Maserati got you influenced
You can't be ashamed 'cause we did do it
But that love word's scary, I done been through it
Trynna walk like a nigga, screamin' "3s up" wanna talk like a nigga
She be thuggin' right with me, I don't need a shooter
Too much money on the table, we can both pursue it

[Chorus: Brittani Jenae]
So I'm calling all the phones (callin')
I don't wanna be alone (oouuu)
I'll be there right away
I'll be there right away
I-, I-, I-
Just tell me how you want it
Just tell me how you want it, babe
Just tell me how you want it
I'll be there right away

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
Umm, I don't know the future
But I was born a king like Martin Luther
I've always had a dream, now watch me do it
It ain't never what it seem, baby play the music
You need 'em, got your BM in my DM, only meet her in the PM
Even though she taken like Liam
Your man Twitter thuggin' tell him run it when I see him
First from my city like Drake Drizzy
Time to get some ink, shout out Frank Nitti
I never lost face so my bank Biggie
I was born a bad boy, you can thank Diddy
We can go M.I.A out in MIA
And just save all the stress for another day
Different town every night, we ain't gotta stay
Uh, let's just hit the road and run away
Yeah, she in love with a Vasi
Both her parents black but she always call me papi
Plus little baby got a body, got me feelin' Godly

[Chorus: Brittani Jenae]
So I'm calling all the phones
I don't wanna be alone
I'll be there right away
I'll be there right away
I-, I-, I-
Just tell me how you want it (tell me how you want it)
Just tell me how you want it
Just tell me how you want it, babe
Just tell me how you want it
I'll be there right away
