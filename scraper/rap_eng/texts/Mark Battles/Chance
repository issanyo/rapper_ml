[Verse 1]
All I needed was a chance
All I needed was a chance
It was me and my [?]
All we needed was a plan
[?] when I made a couple grand
Had me ridin' through my ghetto, baby hello I'm the man
Yes, I am
Or, or at least I will be
And I 'ma go hard, so one of these lame niggas kill me
I'm really
Tired of all the pain and all the arguments
This fame thing is tarnishin' the main thing we started with
It's hard to miss
So, I
I keep moving forward
Mostly been hurt by love
So why you looking forward. (ah)
That's the misery of life
Cause misery loves company, so misery be my wife
I should make me feel so right
Even when I'm wrong
So, I break another heart and then I make another song
I may take another home
I don't like to be alone
I will let you get to know me, 'cause I don't like to talk on phones
I'm a complicated man
For the guy that make me [?]
So, I grow my [?]
[?] show 'em [?]
Understand. (Understand)
Understand

All I needed was a Chance

All I needed (All I needed)
All I needed (All I needed)
All I needed was a Chance

[Verse 2]:
Some nights I cry myself to sleep
'cause life can cut you deep
My mama said:
“That pain can make you stronger or make you weak
Just think before you speak
Learn before you teach
And never break your word
Always practice what you preach.”
Some night I cry myself to sleep, (I cry myself to sleep)
'cause life can cut you deep ('cause life can cut you deep)
That pain will make you weak (I said that pain will make you weak)
My ma': “Always practice what you preach”
Always practice what you preach

[Hook]
All I needed was a Chance
All I needed was a Chance
All I needed (All I needed)
All I needed (All I needed)
All I needed was a Chance
All I needed
