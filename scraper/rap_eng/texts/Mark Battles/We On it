Chorus
Going back six in the mornin
We going to keep going going going
Like Nicki Minaj we living for the moment
You can say we want it we on it
Party don't start till the cops come in x2

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
Same old thang but a different day
I'm on one got me feeling like Drizzy Drake
Since she will treat me in a different
But these girls all talk like Ricky Lakeeeeeeee
I think I got one and if my crew ain't with me then its not fun
Past time just cruisin the top gun
If you ain't trying to party better not come
Shirtless I'm a six pack look
I'll steal your girl man I'm the big rap crook
Then when I say it don't get that shook
I'll have her blow the house like the big bad wolf
Yeah, you got the lost face and slave is so drunk he can't walk straight
Singing and dancing feeling like broadway crashed in the hallway

Chorus
Going back six in the mornin
We going to keep going going going
Like Nicki Minaj we living for the moment
You can say we want it we on it
Party don't start till the cops come in x2

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
Ya'll on one? We'll we on two
Sky is the limit gon' tell me what we gon do
Say you love me girl but don't even know you
But we can kick if you want to
I got one live to life
Wouldn't say I'm famous but I'm something like the kid
We going to keep going until the sunlight begin
Quit knocking on the door just come right on in
All night long keep playing my music and everybody dancing to it
Cops look up on my blind side Sandra Bullock
We ain't going to stop so that man is foolish
Keep the music on blast right
I'll never have a sad night
Its like I did it in a past life
We can do it keep it moving like a mad wife

Chorus
Going back six in the mornin
We going to keep going going going
Like Nicki Minaj we living for the moment
You can say we want it we on it
Party don't start till the cops come in x2
