[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
This is not to be rewarded
Killin' beats that wasn't mine when all my vocals was distorted
See King Dizzy's no different than King James
Cause I live to learn, the world don't want another Michael Jordan
Look, even though I got a jumper like Larry Bird
With all these white girls screaming for me singing every fucking word (word)
I can tell that you the homeboy that ain't never riot
Me? Oh I just make fashion statements almost every night
I'm taking flights without no seatbelt on and landing
Headed to the top and I'm leaving all of these fuck niggas stranded
Nothing handed, we with that learning money management movement
Save it just to spend it, do a show and then I recoup it
Young boss man, fuck an off brand
Me? I'm fuckin' on this bad bitch with a big booty and soft hands
That wanna be my wifey when I'm off cam
But when I'm on cam, she already know the program, I'm pro-gram
So I roll up more grams to slow jams so we can vibe out
We the Cadillac boys, she hop inside so we can ride out
She turn the music up and twist the weed
A real nigga baby, this trip's on me
[Verse 2: Derek Luh]
It's crazy how the trouble kid excel right past 'em
Mashing it's a habit, like fuck it, I gotta have it
She bad, then I gotta bag it, touching her like a tablet
My whole camp moving forward, you just living in the past tense
Shit, I'm tired of these has-beens
I think it's time to cash in
Get your weight up, motherfuck a hater
Homie in it for the paper, get to stepping like Omega
Weight up, wake up, grind 'til the day up
Straight up, say what, it's easy as a layup bahhh
We do it 'til they pissed off
Hustlin' like Rick Ross, dick stained with lip gloss
D-Luh
[Verse 3: Mark Battles]
(Battles! It's Fly America!)
Look, want the money and respect, you can keep the power
Plan to grab the whole world, it may take a hour
Bad hoes in bath robes when I take a shower
Pussy sweet as presidential, call it Eisenhower
My momma wit it, that honest living I gotta get it
The finest women, I try commitment, then I forget it
She riding in it but still in awe that I'm 'bout to hit it
We got a witness, I'm spitting raw with no contradiction
Whoa, they hating on the daily
Used to freestyle for free but now you gotta pay me
Career going 80 and it's starting to drive 'em crazy
Fly America, I'm a patriot, call me Tom Brady
Take it all and leave the rest with 'em
I'm done with the chatter, wanna be the next victim
Call Doctor Khaled, got the we the best syndrome
Undefeated, never lost like a GPS system
Get 'em, I bet you hate that we winning
Keep giving your opinion, it ain't making a difference
If you can't take the heat, then stay away from the kitchen
Your album name is lemonade, could be made in a minute
Get it? Minute Maid, I'm a renegade
They been afraid, I tend to blaze when I'm center stage
Pitching game on my Clemen stain with a different name
Pad all the walls, it's 'bout to get insane, flame
You could tie me in a straitjacket
Proclaimed the nicest in my age bracket
I'm really being modest cause I hate bragging
Study who I am, cram like my name backwards
Ha, it's too much for y'all
Hating on a nigga, so Ku Klux and all
The pain temporary dog, I grew up to ball
Think I'm visually impaired, I don't see them at all
It's Battles
[Verse 4: Euroz]
(Yeah, you know you can't forget the Z)
They throwing salt in the game, nigga Skip Bayless
On that totem pole shit, stacking big faces
Long list of (?) from the wrist, take it
Fly with his (?), it's why the chicks chasing
Naked if she with me, thought you knew this
I've always had a thing for a nudist
Riding on the strip, it's only right I play my new diss
Every time I hear a nigga's song it's like this in a new diss
Tell me what I don't know
Who needs a budget when the haters handle promo
Before they claim King Basquiat was the logo
I stitch crack in every line, the shit's so dope
Never been the type to talk, we a Comcast
Looking all directions possible, the compass
Jean piece 'em when the bullshit don't come pass
(...?), swear this money tend to come fast
No dubstep but I get you beta for cheap
The bed I land was made up by me
My ex is PI, check all the latest to me
Only time she touch the star, she favorite the tweet
I'm the dude like I was robbed - take it from me
I couldn't tell you 'bout the time she was taken from me
Read my pea sized proof and just take it from me
The larger picture, most niggas need patience to see it
(Don't forget the Z...)
[Verse 5: Chris Webby]
On that cypher rap shit, I’m still the awkwardest guy
Then drop flows and serve cats with an order of fries
When my album’s in your whip, make sure the volume is high
‘Cause shit is fresh, they been calling me the Lord of the Fly
I’m part samurai, part Spartan
Part ninja with a pirate’s attitude, proceed with caution
You wish you kept it moving after you step into warriors
Who butt heads like pachycephalosauruses
You won’t be standing when the fucking dust settles dude
So now y’all know exactly what the fuck my pen’ll do
I’m close, I can feel it in my gut, call it seppuku
But ain’t no swords involved with all the shit I’m ‘bout to execute
So play it cool like ehhhh, yo his shit’s straight
Like I ain’t what you bumping at the gym while you lift weights
I let these kids hate, then ask 'em how my dick tastes
And write a whole mixtape on one fucking sync break
Bitch, name a kid who could rap that dope
Since high school, I held the pad and the backpack close
While them one hit wonders, they could stack that dough
They’ll be in gone in 24 like a Snapchat post
I’m a ghost motherfucker, shit I need me a tan
A strong drink and a model on a beach in the sand
But that’ll come when I accomplish all the dreams that I’ve planned
And get more radio activity than seas in Japan
Every station in rotation, they’ll be playing my shit
Until then, I’ll be anywhere they pay me to spit
You ain’t got shit on what I’m gonna do
So pump the brakes like a school bus and stop it right in front of you, bitch
[Verse 6: Emilio Rojas]
Emilio, my name is synonymous with the truth
Like Chris Brown name is synonymous with abuse
(Fuck the system!)
It’s like it’s anonymous in this booth
I be riding uptown with some mamis that’s in the coupe
And we don’t like nobody except the clique that we rolling with
You ain’t on the dick, I expected you to go and hold the shit
Buzz a little bit, I ain’t have a label promoting it
I never had a fucking co-sign, I been alone in this
My heart’s cold, my ribs are refrigeration
My lungs are like ventilation, don’t fuck with this Venezuelan
(Just the tip!)
Now y’all will get fucked with no penetration
I be rocking All Saints, they cuts have been venerated
Ah, our generation is drug addicted and lost
But I ain’t judging nothing man, Jesus carried the cross
And Mari bust it open, them Virgin Marys are gone
If Jesus was a carpenter, license seen, he has a saw
Street code of ethics, the code of silence
And I seen a fiend so co-dependent on dope we buying
They took his ass to court as a co-defendant on trial
And they lock him up for what they should treat him for ‘cause they wylin’
Shit ain’t never change, it ain’t gonna
They should make my people legal before they do the marijuana
Instead INS will be rushing us to the border
‘Cause you can’t tax a person for wanting more for they daughter
(It's E to the M-I, L-I, O, I'm saying)
[Verse 7: Cory Gunz]
Whoever want it can get it, word to you and yours
I don't buy convertibles, you know they shoot in doors
I ain't to be slept on, but niggas asleep
Like the king to be crept on, so niggas'll creep
Stay in your lane or get swept on, cause niggas is sweet
Yeah he came with his weapon, for niggas to weep
Try and name what they rep on, the niggas'll reap
Anything getting stepped on, my niggas'll leak
Shouldn't have played, playing for keeps
Bullshit all ya'll talk came with receipts
I aim, squeeze, bang and repeat
Stain in the streets
Think before you rap before they clap the brain out ya peeps
Skullcandy soldier, (...?)
(...?) full of shells like the Zi in Zeeti
Let the Macaroni fly, satisfied when you bring me half of only I
Then you laugh and throw me fire
Pause this rap shit, been ahead of my time
Ahead of my grind, no pawn keep a head to my nine
Nothing in my mind made up, I made up my mind
That's if a nigga play us, I'm facing my time
Want the crib (...) can find
Hardly got living room space, haters lamp shading my shine
From the cradle to the grave of my grind
Filet a nigga from the navel to the waves of my nine
My influences are cable and crime
Making bagel designs and being a fucking tornado with rhyme
My influences are cable and crime
Making bagel designs and being a fucking tornado with rhyme
I'm done
