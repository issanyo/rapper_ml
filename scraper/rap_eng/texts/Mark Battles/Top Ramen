Look

[Verse 1]
Quit asking a room with us, dog not trying to pair with you
Bought to call Derek Luh, and tell him bring some Theraflu
I’m sick and it’s terrible
Got the game in a knot, they think it's marital
I’m calling for a burial
Huh, I’m steady body-in rappers
Then if he is a fraud then he probably a rapper
Man I swear to God I’m getting tired of you rappers
Lyrical massacre, just let the audio capture
It’s time to get up
Y’all better get up
I’m going hard as Quagmire in the strip club
They say you won’t ever get a big buzz
Cause you ain’t never do drugs and you ain’t hanging with thugs
Well, I guess I’m beating all the odds
And all your girlfriends wanna freak me and Minaj
I’m such a mac I make Steven get a Job
Look Jesus in his eyes say I’m the closest thing to God
Beside you, serve a nigga quicker than a drive-thru
Rob-who? Family full of killers like the mob though
Calliou, sprouting up the game till I’m top two
He a lame, scared to say my name so it’s not true
Old times, day dreaming in my high school
Like give me a shot, no telling what I might do
I used to say I can’t wait till I get hot ramen
No more fears, no more tears, no more top rhymin
You better hold your crew down, stop cock hoping
What would Mike and Pippen be if they ain’t got Rodman
How can you smile when ain’t no food in the house
Raised in a zoo, we just trying to make it out
A pad on the hills, can I see what that’s about?
You can sit and wait around, dog I gotta get it now
The clock is ticking, our prompt is time to get it
Grind for an honest living, in the thousands of the finest women
My decisions, they right or wrong
That’s opinionated
Say all the right things, never demonstrated
I just do me and they truly try to imitate it
I kept it real and some how they call me innovative
Should of been a made-it
Well I guess not
Me and Cuse claiming Curry got the best shot
Huh, I been looking, I ain’t trying to flex
I give ‘em more sixteens than the driver’s test
I’m not impressed, we cut different, you not a threat
Won’t put my name on the line unless I’m signing checks
Yes, I think I’m doing wonderful, you make excuses trying to start that’s why you number two
Get it? How you fall before the summer’s through
Fly high get flown over it’s nothing new
Battles
