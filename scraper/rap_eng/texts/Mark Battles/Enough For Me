[Verse 1: Mark Battles]

People say I'm to quiet I need to talk more
Hearing that is like nails on a chalkboard
I lost my brother as a sophmore
Dream of the finish line but always fall short
Oh well, keep working
Failures not an option man I gotta be certain
We all make mistakes no use in trying to be perfect
Getting pushed under the water but I climb and resurface
It keep hurting
The pain is so hard, a bully come in your yard
You better not let him boguard
You off the deep end
No need to pretend
I'm 20 with three kids so I got to dream big
Feel like Jay when he got his first deal
Feel like trunk when he got his first meal
Cut off your water, show you how this thirst feel
It's a disgrace all of these fakes with the crowded church feel
All these restless phonies
With their testimonies
You called me your little brother but you left me lonely
Had to do it by myself with nobodies help I am no Micheal Phelps
I was drowning in the water I ain't gon lie
But you lost half of your mind thinking I ain't gon try
I'd rather die than let a day go by
Where my kids go hungry and I can't provide
I'm gon make it happen I hope ya'll see the plan
It's crazy how momma had to teach me how to be a man
Lord knows I've been living tough
The last time I gave up I gave up giving up
My mind be on that different stuff
Fly as a fox call me Vivica
Put in twice golf miniature
I speak to reach I'm on some floss dental stuff

[Hook]
No (x4)
It ain't enough for me (x3)
Got me screaming out
Oh (x4)
So when he come for me (x2)
I'll be ready
I'mma be ready

[Verse 2: Mark battles]
A yacht in the what, I need to know now
Because it's finna go down
My city is a ghost town
A bunch of hasbins, on they last winds
See me bout to shine, so in they minds they wanna cash in
Thats just the way of life
It cost to be the boss so you got to pay the price
It's crazy right?
But it made me fight
Do what I gotta do
Because something being impossible, is impossible
A little obstacle could never ever stop the dude
I stay positive I'm like some bad doctor news
I'm like a little kid in the locker room
Lacing up his soccer shoes
Feeling like he gotta prove
It to himself and I ain't in it for the wealth
Of course the money helps
I'm just hoping this helps
A little money ain't enough for me
I want to say I made a difference when he come for me
