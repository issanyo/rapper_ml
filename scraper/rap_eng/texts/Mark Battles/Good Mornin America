Good Mornin America
Good Mornin America
I said America
Good Mornin America

Yeah, it's time to wake up
Massive earthquake cuz the world I'mma shake up
A quick take over not to long before the change up
Wake up
Stay up

Good Mornin America x7

This my big shot
Much appreciation
Not to many get the chance just to brief the nation
Just a one on one talk no mediation
Mark battles is the gov no abbreviation
No stage names
My mamma made me real
On my grind I'm working hard just to pay these bills
Pockets looking kind of slim I know how shady feel
So why these groupies want my cemen like a Navy Seal
Woah! Woah! Baby Chill
I'm not interested
Pounding like Thunder
Doing numbers like arithmatic
Feeling strong as Arnold
And yall looking like Benedict
Gone face the feet because you sweeter than a sinister
My sleeve got many tricks
All though it looks smooth
Live in the Hood but not a hood dude
Im just a good man in a good mood
With a flow about as raw as uncooked food
Do this music just to calm nerves
I go hard never say I lost urge
No hesitation all verbs
Puzzle you by the way that I cross word
Hah yeah battles the reason I rap it up like an aids convention
Cause in this bizz you have to stay consistent
Hip Hop education rappers better pay attention
I'm sick and tired of these nursery rhymes
Dr. Seuss done had his term its Hercules time
Every verse that be lined should have a perjury crime
I'mma keep it real
Yall can make it up
Because common people can relate to us
I will never sell my soul just to make a buck
Good Morning America its time for waking up!

Yeah, it's time to wake up
Massive earthquake cuz the world I'mma shake up
A quick take over not to long before the change up
Wake up
Stay up

Good Mornin America x7
