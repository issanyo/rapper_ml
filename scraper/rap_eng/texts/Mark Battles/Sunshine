[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
I got a dad, I just don't know that nigga
But I'mma be a big star and I'mma show that nigga
Why you leave me dog? You should have stayed
All them lies you told and all the games you played
I ain't tripping nah, I ain't crying no  more
Having a convo with you don't cross my mind no more
I hope you...let me stop cause the anger
Got me wasting too much time on stranger
Thank you a lot, you motivated me to be everything you not
I work day and night for everything i got
Passing through life tryna miss the rain
I never sell my soul for the price of fame
Its hard to fall in love when they all the same
Get the love from all the fans when they cheer my name
And I'm living out the dream so i can't complain
Do what I can and the rest will change

[Hook: Mark Battles]
I don't wanna see no more rain
Rain rain go away
I don't wanna feel no more pain
Can you come back another day?
You gotta keep your head up even when you're fed up
They wanna see you fall so please don't let up
You gotta keep your head up even when you're fed up
They wanna see you fall so please don't let up

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Dipping in the sunshine cause I'm clutch when its crunch time
Let the mean OG rhymes in these lines
No fleas big dog clean when ever he seen
Cool burst Listerine the flow pristine
So my reputation perceives they know what it means
Though I maintain the lowest of keys
Cause the light that shine make it too easy to find
Sometimes, I get my paper and prepare for the worst
Pushing never come to shove my brother it hit him first
I'm rolled up, [?], doors up, reminiscing
Tony on the balcony, coke, shot to pieces
Smoked in his mansion when he was just lamping
That's how it happens, real life news crews though
No lights cameras, action, no actors, just asking
Who did it? Now they finna go and get them niggas

[Hook: Mark Battles]

[Verse 3: Derek Luh]
I miss my blue skies, I hate when the weather change
Slip into that heather grey hoodie, pray for better days
I swear we'll find a better way, I promise, boy scouts honor
You know this ain't the OG known as formerly dishonest
I care about your problems and I grew a little conscious
Stay working hard, working hard will take you far
Now we're pushing foreign cars and fully paid Audis
Apartment 209 bare walls with suede couches
And we claiming so we live in fully paid houses
With newly wed spouses, still learning how to trust them
God damn that's just the hardest
My last residence is just as cold as my heart is
Apprentice to a master now I truly know what art is
