[Verse 1]
Yo yo. Just listen
Finally got a chance to speak my mind right?
So do I talk about the fine dykes, nine flights in five nights?
How these model chicks'll suck dick for lime light
Asking for your child but claiming they ain't the mom type (or)
Do I use my voice to make a difference?
Forget Mercedes Benz's, nigga it's babies missing
Can't pay your rent and so you end up with a crazy sentence
Purchase an image bought a friendship but won't pay attention (wow)
What kind of life you out here starving sort of hard to take advice
Regret the bad decisions am I wrong to make it right?
My mentor went to prison while he had to pay that price
(Let my people go) I'm screaming "free my nigga Jimmy"
Cruisin' through the city with 'bout 50 in my skinnies
I really came from nothin' so I'm stuntin' like I'm Diddy
And all these rappers actors no more Grammy's here's an Emmy
Yeah I'm a hater oh well they only give you sex, lies and drugs just to sell
I wanna be the next guy that thugs really feel
And have the white kids like "yo the nigga's trill"
Bout to grow some mill and we ain't go and get a deal
Hard hat and a hammer let me show you how to build
No co-signs or dance songs I did it with my skill
If you wasn't with me in the field never tell me chill

[Hook]
Let us grow
Just let us grow
Just let us grow
Let us grow

[Verse 2]
My whole life I was treated like the underdog
Don't try my mother y'all pistol in her wonder bra
She always told me keep it real and you won't never fall
And when you feel it's hard to walk boy you better crawl
I lost my brother as a sophomore
I wish we fought less and talk more
But living how we did it was hardcore
It's either get it how you live or live in cardboard
No Star Wars it's bullet holes in car doors
Our hard chores will stick together and guard yours
No D-Wade's or Maya Moore's
You don't get a chance what you trying for?

[Hook]
Let us grow
Just let us grow
Just let us grow
Let us grow
