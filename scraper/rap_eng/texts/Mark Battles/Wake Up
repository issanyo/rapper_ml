It's Fly America, right?
3's up

[Verse 1]
I say a man ain't nothing without his word
Work myself to death trying to get what I deserve
I was in the booth while my friends was smoking herb
Senior year skipping class like I ain't had nothing to learn
I never was a trouble maker
Just had a Xerox mind set, trying to double paper
It wasn't nothing, few scuffles with a couple haters
I know you pray I name drop, but I ain't doing favors
See ya later, I'm outie 5000
Bored in Michael Kors just browsing
The biggest faker is usually the loudest
I'm just smiling at you cowards, all my ex's say I'm childish
I could care less cause my mama is the proudest
We gon' make it mama, I promise that
Tired of trips to the laundry mat and whips that are Pontiac
Verses I'mma body bag just to get a sight of that
Now he mad, try me last, wrong one to go against

[Hook]
I grind, success is on my mind
Putting in double overtime every time I wake up
Wake up

[Verse 2]
Never let a little bit of fame come and change me
You ain't bringing food to the table, then you can't eat
City going crazy, lost three friends in the same week
So every where I go, me and my bros about eight deep
Baby what you trying to do?
Hit me around nine and you can slide on through
I know your real intentions, I'm pretending I ain't got a clue
Hot as June, by any means for that bada-boom
Time to bloom, try anything that we gotta do
Fly America, I'm rightfully the owner
I give this game my heart, would you like to be a donor
Independent, so I fight for the exposure
Same regime, if you ain't like it, hit the road and blow your motor
Yes we next, best of best
And my apologies if I left a mess
Shook him up, he start disappearing like an Etch-A-Sketch
Direct connects, ethernet
Boy I'll put you out the game like your second tech

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
She said, you know I love you right?
Aww that's so nice of you, I guess I'll say I like you too
At least until this night is through
Doing what we like to do, vibing with my broham's
She said, can I be your boo? I replied, no mam
I'm grinding like a slow jam
Ain't got no time for romance
Saying he gon' off us, he just talking just like Conan
They been in my home state for months
That don't mean we changing up
Still repping Indiana on some Pacer stuff
Hater what?
