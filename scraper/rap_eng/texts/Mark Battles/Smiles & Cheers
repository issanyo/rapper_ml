[Intro: Mark Battles]
Sample
Dear heavenly Father
I humbly come to you today
Askin' for courage, askin' for strength
Askin' you to help me not slap the shit out of somebody

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
Woke up feelin' like I wasn't shit
How long my heart been broke? Nobody cared to see it fixed
In bed all day, I'm only up to eat and take a piss
No, I don't know everything, but man it can't be it
This can't be life, I think depression got me feelin' trapped
All my wrongs and my mistakes, I hope to take them back
Nah, I don't need your sympathy, I simply statin' facts
I know you're used to smiles and cheers but this is where I'm at
My step father used to beat me up
So when I see him now I always keep a pistol tucked
We both can die today, my nigga I don't give a fuck
I block my preacher, phone kept callin', tryna wake me up
Good luck, no emotion in a foggy daze
I'm really startin' to think I'm payin' for my doggy ways
Open up to all my fans, my mamma call it brave
I'm not ashamed, I'm in a lot of pain, I'm in a lot of pain
I think depression got me feelin' trapped (trapped)
I think depression got me feelin' trapped (trapped)
I think depression got me feelin' trapped
I know you're used to smiles and cheers, but this is where I'm at
Facts, I woke up feelin' like I wasn't shit
Nobody text my phone, don't really care if I exist
They love to see you down and out
Don't want to see you rich, don't want to see you smile
My God this can't be it, I know this can't be it
Depression got me feelin' trapped
Depression got me feelin' trapped
Depression got me feelin' trapped
They killed my nigga, I can't bring him back

[Bridge: Mark Battles & Kyland Taylor]
We're so close to heaven, oohh
But you don't understand me, oohh
And I can barely stand it, oohh
Because I thought you would know, oh
Because I thought you would know, oh
That we're so close to heaven, oohh
You smoke 'cause you stressed out, oohh
But do not hold your breathe in, oohh
'cause it burns slow, ooh, ooh, 'cause it burns slow ooh ooh

[beat change]

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
Am I wrong for havin' questions? Every song, every blessing
Feelin' strong but I'm restless for the love and the essence
Shoulder shrugs all the extras, keep it seperate
Goddamn, what's a man to do when nothin' really goes how you planned it to
And all the little things seem to damage you
You can't stand the truth, right 'cause it hurt too much
I don't see the hate, I work too much
I ain't here to preach put the church suit up
Lost a lot of friends when I first grew up, niggas trippin'
Love can have you blinded, it be so one-sided, I'm reminded
Of the times I gave you the world and in return, I couldn't find it
Love, that is, and because that I'm feelin' heartless
But regardless, I'ma make it out these hardships
Yeah, Day 2
