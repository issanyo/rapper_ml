12Fifteen OJ Ricki Vasi nigga

[Verse 1: 12Fifteen]
If it ain't Vasi then it ain't gang, and I ain't waiting on you lame niggas
OG Jelly popping pain killers my nigga really in pain, and we ain't ever had to stunt so we shoot the scene with the same niggas
Need a bag every month want a Jag with no roof
Fuck a bad bitch toss the magnum hop in the bath when I'm through
Run into the land young niggas a fan a young nigga had to salute
I like when the camera shoot, might act an ass on the roof
Staying high nigga day and night feel like the man on the moon
If Scotty [?] was here man h'ed probably fuck with the strand that I blew
You niggas can't come up in here looking comfortable here  if you not with the crew
Just don't even hop in the booth, 'fore you end up all on the news
See them V's coming nigga V's coming
We coming like 300
We're all ready for the mean mugging
Hard headed nigga weed puffing

[Hook]
Mhmm stand and salute
I feel like the man on the moon
Fly let the camera shoot
I feel like the man on the moon
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
They say I go too deep I need to lighten up
Ricki smoke to fall asleep he always lighting up
All these other niggas trash so why y'all hype em up?
I truly feel no other clique is half as nice as us
Light the blunts and the candles just to set the vibe
A lot of things up on my mind I need to speak to God
My lil cousin say she find it hard to trust and shit
She so depressed that on a couple nights she cut her wrist
She say death before 20 is on her bucketlist
I look up to the sky like what the fuck is this?
It's what we call life, guess it's alright
When it's hard to see I use the fog lights
It's always peace and love but we can all fight
Cause I'm fed up with you clowns don't mess with y'all types
Shout out Futuristic he 100 G
They tried to make us beef Nicki Cardi B
So much stuff up on my mind at night I hardly sleep
I wasn't perfect in my past so I'm at these parties deep
In case a nigga creep, might break a nigga feet
Them my OG's the twins'll kill for me
Laying back while she blow me like a swisher sweet
I don't need a drug, I just need a beat
Let me eat please I'm trying to feast
So I can help me bread grow like some damn yeast
On my soul I'll knock a nigga out his damn sneaks
Cause I'm sick of all the sneak dissin'
Couple freaks kissin', suck me till her cheeks twitchin'
When my money getting low I tend to speak different
When your money getting low your friends will seem distant
Keep the cheese dripping cause they're fucking thirsty
On a highway zoning out going 130
You know them Porsche's got more horses then a fucking Derby
I'm trying make 35 before I'm touching 30
Mills that is it's time to build that big
Empire blacks eyeing like Will I'm is
Or is it Will I'm Ain't?
Slow down now? Nah, still I can't
So damn fly won't spill my drink
The Moon
It's Fly America
