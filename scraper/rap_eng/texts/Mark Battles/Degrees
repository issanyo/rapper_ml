[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
Hello lady, how ya day goin?
I be speedin through this life, like I'm Jeff Gordon
You can kick it here tonight cause the rest borin
Just be sure and catch a cab 'fore it hit mornin
That's a stiff warning
You too focused on the finer things
Well connected like siamese
Attempt to keep my mind at ease
I think I lost it, can you find it please?
Overtime and its my mind say long as I can breathe
Get on the beat and you know that's kill't
Heard your song, skipped through it, like low fat milk
Nobody cares how we got here, now that it's built
Quir playin pranks on poor Hank, I'm the King of the Hill
Taking it over, all the pain created a soldier
Making my moves, breakin the rules, gotta train for exposure
Take it or lose, straight to the moon and we ain't pullin over
Got the name by my lonesome, what was the hol up
Wait up...
I'ma treat it like I bleed it
Before it came to life I could see it
You [?] mistake kindness for weakness
I'll kindly slap a nigga in his mouth if he need it

It's preseason
Welcome to my world
....
This is for you, enjoy it

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
I'm back, I'm just lettin you know
Y'all still livin in the past, this The 70's Show?
My legacy wrote, now they look at me to close
All the haters muggin, I just look happy and pose
Big whoa, you worried about your fashion and clothes
All these rappers is cloned, lil jr's taggin along
Too hard to try, its hard to write
It's cause I'm bad to the bone
Get my cash and I'm gone
BARS, They don't ask me the wrong
I'ma get it for my team bro
It's Fly America I'm sitting back like yeeain' kno?
I'm hotter than a heat stroke, nasty as a deep throat
She easy as a free throw, never let the league go

Battles
Hahahaa.. let me stop
3's up
