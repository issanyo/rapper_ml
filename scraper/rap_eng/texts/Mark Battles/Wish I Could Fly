[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
The king is finally home
Off the road and back in my zone
I gotta catch 'em alone
All these niggas sneak diss when I'm gone
But when I'm back they blowing my phone
It's only making me strong
Impatient, I can't wait to be on
I'mma spend a hundred grand every place that we roam
Yeah I'm kidding but my business on the way to be known
Plus my sister went to college, who gonna pay for these loans?
I gotta get it, said I was dreaming too big
But all the things I seen as a kid, it made me swing for the fence
You can't tell me this as good as it gets
You see my face, am I looking convinced?
Hello ladies and gents, give me your mind, you can pay me in cents
Hope it translate to money, gotta pay for the rent
Not complaining 'bout my life or the way that it went
I'm just preparing for the future with the greatest intent

[Hook:  Brittani Jenae (Mark Battles)]
I just wish I could fly away
(I just wish I could fly
Get away from here and live in the sky
I just wish I could) fly away
(Really wish we could fly
Get away from here and live in the sky
I really wish we could)

[Verse 2: Derek Luh]
Help beef tenderize when they hear what you made
It's rare meat to medium cause I feel what's at stake
Got sober on my own, couple years of mistakes
Ain't breaking mama's heart, no more tears on her face
So your boy got to cooking
Spicing up the game got a taste and they hooting
Fell in love with the boss, now they looking to boogie
Fell in love with the cars, now they look and we push it
But I gotta thank God man, look where you put me
Got me through them rough times, glad that he pushed me
Went for my dreams, had the passion and look it
Still wonder why you hate on me, you made that you couldn't
Backing from the team, we sharing half of the cookie
We needed what we needed, ain't no asking, we took it
Look it, I ain't stressing 'bout my past ways
Hope I earn my wings when I'm dancing my last dance
