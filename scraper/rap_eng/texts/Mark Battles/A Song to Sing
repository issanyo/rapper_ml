[Verse 1]
I wrote this song when I should've been taking notes
I'm in the back of the class and I got my hat real low
You know how that shit go
I ain't biting my tongue
Man, I'm just tryna touch bases like I hit a homerun
So put your middle fingers down to your thumb
And just let it snap like that
Yeah, bring it back that's a wrap, hold up (hey)
And I got a pretty girl on the east side
We both scared to love so she only comes at midnight
The good times
OK, but this is for the day when everybody love theyself
And ain't nobody wanna trade, and ain't nobody wanna leave
'Cause everybody wanna stay
And we do something so great
That we just popped champagne because we did it
I lost my childhood friend
He caught a case in high school and I ain't even seen him since
But like a period I'm waiting for your sentence to end
Joey, this one for the day when you free again

[Chorus: Devvon Terrell]
What a beautiful day and let's keep it that way
Let's save all the trouble and throw it away
So we can have a world that's all together today
If you with me let me hear you say, let me hear you say
If you can dance in the rain (dance in the rain)
It ain't no thing (it ain't no thing)
Just grab an umbrella (just grab an umbrella)
And find a song to sing (and find a song to sing)

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
Let's find a song to sing
And a bunch of dope drinks for us all to bring
I began as a peasant and became a king
I started from the bottom wouldn't change a thing
So can we toast to it?
I ain't made it all the way but I'm close to it
So clueless, don't judge until you go through it
World colder than a Frieza watch me Goku it
I wanna make it last
More laughs, more money, and more Breaking Bad
She know I rap so she shaking ass
But don't try so hard, you just make me laugh
But can she sit still
Me and Kid Quill are sort of like a big deal
Tell them haters, they can get real
On the days like this we can just chill

[Chorus: Devvon Terrell]
What a beautiful day and let's keep it that way
Let's save all the trouble and throw it away
So we can have a world that's all together today
If you with me let me hear you say, let me hear you say
If you can dance in the rain (dance in the rain)
It ain't no thing (it ain't no thing)
Just grab an umbrella (just grab an umbrella)
And find a song to sing (and find a song to sing)
What a beautiful day and let's keep it that way
Let's save all the trouble and throw it away
So we can have a world that's all together today
If you with me let me hear you say, let me hear you say
If you can dance in the rain
It ain't no thing
Just grab an umbrella
And find a song to sing

[Outro: Teeklef]
We will sing (sing)
We will sing (sing)
We will sing (sing)
We will sing (sing)
