[Hook: Derek Luh]
I think I'm in and out of my conscious
Live long and prosper
Can't change a thing and it ain't the same
And I swear to God, I'm being honest
Ain't [?] for nothing you promise
[?]
This dirty game is corrupt from fame
And it turned me straight into a monster
I'm a monster (x4)

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
Slow creep on beats I'm a bully
Labeled as a monster with the ink, call me Sully
Pulling strings like woody
Trayvon Martin with the hoodie
But I'm strapped, what's goodie?
Now she handing me the cookie
Always wanna bang like LeBron as a rookie
I just do my thing and they seem to overlook me
Now it's 5 and some change if you're interested in booking (ho)
You can keep on hating
Put it all on the line like I'm free throw making
Time after time showing zero patience
Going at ya neck, get [?]
He's so blatant, [?] matrix
No you wanna sign me? Keep yo agents (ho)
Cut it out, we don't need no favors
Love for my niggas, finger for my haters

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
Hello world, the monster is rapping
Law of attraction is coffins and ashes
Squad of assassins
He talk to me backwards
Had to get patched up, varsity jackets
Conquered the masses
[?] reactions
Had to thank God cause we rose through the madness
Leave a rose on the casket
.44s is blasting
Jelly might explode out a headband
That's my nigga for life
Give him all that's left 'til we getting it right
Gotta give my kids ambition to fight
That's why it's back to the grind when I kiss 'em goodnight

[Hook]
