[Chorus]
I been workin' for some years and it ain't gonna stop
Gonna bring my homies with me when we make it to the top
Gotta keep goin' hard till my niggas off the block
No more runnin' from the cops, are we doin' this or not?
Man they can't tell me shit

[Verse 1]
Hello, we really made it from the bottom right?
My niggas with me coachin' Indy like I'm Bobby Knight
I can't stay up in your city, gotta catch a flight
We comin' up, my money up, my niggas set the price
Yeah my nuts big but my pants extra tight
I spent some years in the dark, I wanna see the light
OK to be the boss, you gotta pay the price
No way will I fall victim to some bad advice
I was lost but that's past tense
My niggas fightin' in the club just like Brad Pitt
Lord forgive me for the bad shit
In my life 'cause I ain't have shit, we roll some ashes

[Chorus]
I been workin' for some years and it ain't gonna stop
Gonna bring my homies with me when we make it to the top
Gotta keep goin' hard till my niggas off the block
No more runnin' from the cops, are we doin' this or not?
Man they can't tell me shit
I done gained from my pain, now they can't tell me shit
These niggas talk a big game, well let's do it then

[Verse 2]
Forget them niggas and that fake love
If you ain't ready to die for me, then it ain't love
And if it ain't that Vasi shit, then I can't budge
Won't ever change, I understand just what the fame does
We the same us
Now we ain't gotta change the party, we just change clubs
And I exchange hugs
With all my real niggas, that's that gang love
Do the damn thing, I mean you the damn thing
Put your knees to your neck, make you pull your hamstring
Your mommy she be trippin' when she sippin' champagne
All them dead presidents come and join the campaign

[Chorus]
I been workin' for some years and it ain't gonna stop
Gonna bring my homies with me when we make it to the top
Gotta keep goin' hard till my niggas off the block
No more runnin' from the cops, are we doin' this or not?
Man they can't tell me shit (man they can't tell me shit)
I done gained from my pain, now they can't tell me shit
(but you already knew that though)
These niggas talk big game, well let's do it then
It's Fly America
