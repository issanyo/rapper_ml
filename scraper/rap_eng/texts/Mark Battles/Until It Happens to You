[Verse 1: Futuristic]
Yo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh, yo
Yo, stories of glory, I always hear from these other niggas
In the midst of things, it feels like no one's fucking with ya
'Til you get recognized and start to take a bunch of pictures
With shy fans, who get dragged up by their brothers and sisters
What's up girl, I'm with you, kiss on her cheek
She never thought it would happen
Hit with a tweet, she smile and laughing
Them simple actions, I follow my passion
I did some things, that you couldn't imagine
All cause of rapping, been up for a week, I think that I'm crashing
And an accident just took one of the homies
Drunk driving, damn, I do that all the time
And I know it's a crime, I been faded out my mind
I got home and fell asleep, I can't even remember the drive
But I'm fine, I probably should settle down pretty soon
I hit my ex, but she ain't in the mood
I text a friend, what should a nigga do?
And she replied, she got a dude and it isn't you

[Hook: Futuristic]
Everything's good [2x]
Everything's fine
Everything's cool
Until it happens to you, yeah [3x]
It seems so far, seems so far, then you like, oh my God
But it ain't no problem
Until it happens to you, yeah [3x]

[Verse 2: Futuristic]
Yo, back to my story, I never thought I'd cry for a girl
I was scared, but I know now, I provided the world
I've been with chicks and I left them and they came running back
But, enough is enough, she calling my bluff, I fucked up
She ain't coming back, so I'm trying to focus on some other shit
Family matters, I wanna make all my brothers rich
I never thought it, but brody came out the closet
I'm thinking about the words, that I called him
And how we felt the shit
Joseph is homeless, brandon donating plasma
I travel the country getting this money, man, that shit don't add up
I'm the youngest, but they look to me for guidance
I would help them, but you can't help somebody
That's never trying
Always lying, living in the dreamworld
They jealous but, I don't get that
If you stay by me, I got your back
I promise bro, just sit back
But they ain't with that, so we don't talk
And we don't chill and our home's broken
And we laugh now, when we live life and we act fine
So you don't know this

[Hook: Futuristic]

[Verse 3: Mark Battles]
Yeah, trynna get us out the struggle, kiss my son on his cheek
And say, you know that daddy love you
Explain it to your mother, we ain't happy as a couple
She'll listen when I mumble, say I'm meant to be her husband
But I disagree, so she use you, to get to me
Four years of misery, typically, I would say, it's all good
But it's really not, walking on these building blocks
Trynna get to the top
And this anger got me tripping off the smallest things
Say they treat me like the king, but fame ain't all it seems
Don't judge a book by it's cover
A thief by his hunger, or a ho by your mother
It's tougher when it happens to you, this game is lacking the truth
That's why I'm back in the booth, and my actions is proof, true
It's time to show the plan, asking for change like a homeless man
Here we go again
