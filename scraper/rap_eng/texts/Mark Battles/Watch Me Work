[Verse 1]
Mama told me that life ain't fair
Ain't get much from my pops cause he wasn't there
Want it all for myself, I'm just learning to share
Done offering my help, hope you niggas prepared
Better get you a chair, you will notice that I'm physically rare
Kill these weak rappers off just to show that I care
I swear, I took it easy for a minute
And want repeat of my CD, you should meet me at the clinic
It's tinted like [?] she'll leave me if it's rented
And I don't think she need me she just keep me for the image
Yeah I know it's pitiful, pick them out, send a few
Get in mine, finish line, like I'm selling tennis shoes
First you wanna ridicule, now you want to interview
Changing to a different dude, a monster when I'm in the booth
Popeye sip this spinach juice, liars know I been the truth
All of them just missing proof, the key is how you get it lose
You see, doubting is a no-no, hurt them with the slow flow
Do it for the promo, kill a nigga with three sixteens, cause I'm stone cold
The shows sold ticket sales by the boat load
If she cute she can have it, when she blew me, was magic
Sent Frank Lucas a package
Got the status from my habits cause I'm truly a savage
I'mma drive 'til we fill up, stay away from the captain

[Hook]
Watch me work nigga, just watch me work
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Watch me work nigga, just watch me work

[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm by the booth, Superman alive
And now I do the things that I used to fantasize
Grew up in the city where they kill you over pride
Man, I ain't been the same ever since my brother died
I'm looking for a reason to quit
All that hate turn to love but they seem to forget
Don't expose your whole hand only show them a glimpse
Understand who I am before you open your lips
Getting close to the cliff, I'm 'bout to push
Making major waves, in a year, I got them shook
The way I make your pay disappear, I'm like a crook
How you make the fans scream and cheer without a hook?
Nigga I should write a book, look
The hell with cancer, took my granny out for good
Gotta make my momma proud and get my family out the hood
You the only one that shocked, cause I always knew I could
I done ran through all these niggas, think I'm hanging out with Suge

[Hook]
Watch me work nigga, just watch me work
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Watch me work nigga, just watch me work
