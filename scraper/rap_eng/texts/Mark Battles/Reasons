[Verse]
Am getting on so they hating me hard
Do my thing pulling the string like i play the guitar
Boy sick man no one can escape from these bars
Never learn until until they started that's they way we are
It's scary here 19 i see murder 5 guys i run with
They don’t sell no cheese burgers all my niggas
Street surfers animals and Steve Erwin and hustling
Just to sleep perfect grind until my knees hurting
But what you niggas gonna say now
80 thousand paint houses so don’t hit me with the fake smiles
Had a little running guns watch them break down
Limited discussions ain’t got nothing for a straight clown
I’m too focused on the finish
I don’t even drink I got the bottles for the women
Sending naked pics she ain’t modeled in a minute
Don’t let this mouth fool you if you have a problem we can get it
Stabbed in the bag by the ones that you love
Don't worry about all the hate just retain all the plugs
Never been a thug never sold a drug but the hood showed me love
Cause i came from the mud the not getting buzz so they can’t get enough
So they roll and go home in the mud
Tourn in the bus so the haters feeling rushed
I’m just living out the dream I’m not really doing much
Hush we can show them in the baddest way
Get up on the track and just snap just set a date
We match cat that will just clap like Patty cake
Raw reps all facts better get it straight
Many of these niggas just talk like Ricky Late
Need a lady with some cake and a pretty face
That can suck me all out and cook a steak
All you need is 5k you can book a date
Get a little put away for a rainy day
Everybody trying to eat can i get a plate
Can i have it i suddenly need it
You don’t believe it i guess you have your reasons
I pray to Jesus he rid me of these daemons
Made her fall in love in the evening now she need it
Fall back the kid dog i think I’m keening
I intend to be the greatest in life before i leave you
Is battles you threes up its far Rica
