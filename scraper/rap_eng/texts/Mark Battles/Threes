[Verse: Mark Battles]
Ohhh you do this for fun bro
25 on a stab just to unload
25, city tour, keep the blunts rolled
20 hoes breaking code just for front row
And I don't even smoke though
Apple Doug had the pounds by the boatload
OG Jelly had the city in a chokehold
You weak niggas put a nigga up in go-mode
Stick me on the big screen
Get cream every time I hit a 16
Fit, mean, ripped jeans, and the kicks clean
Lil nigga from the 'Nap doing big things
Cause anything can happen
Fame, money, fashion, how I make it as a rapper?
Tried to hold me down, had to break up out the shackles
I ain't on the album, do it really even matter?
But it's your time right?
Bout to lose it like a virgin chick on prom night
Go hard, got bars, like I crime fight
And don't tell me how to live, this is my life
I'ma do what I please
Your career manufactured like fruit with no seeds (eugh)
Cut the roof off the coupe, feel the breeze
Ballin doin' threes like a nigga in the league
Take a few of these, it'll catch you up to speed
F.A. is a team, yo we got what you need
Once you a Vasi nigga, Ima be honest with ya
That's not what you need
Clock won't stop, turn the prophet degree
My girl keep crying, got snot in her weave
Hop up and leave, can't stop the proceeds
Drop the degrees then pocket the cheese
How you gone stop a machine?
Party with my team, cause it started as a dream
No Martin Luther King, this is hardly what it seem
(Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup...) nigga Threes
