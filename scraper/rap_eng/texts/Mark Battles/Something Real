[Intro]
(I don’t know)
1 2 3 sup
[?]
But I’m ok with that

[Verse 1]
I never focus on the right things
Now I’m hanging I’m embracing all the light brings
We gonna make it so [?] selling me those pipe drinks
You can save it, I’m not hatin’, I’m just saying
Time wasted, let’s get it, more rotten than sex business
So what am I [?], I have to let them go
Can’t falling me sex widow
A bunch of nest they’re bringing their stressed widow
Looking around like who is my next victim
Just a young boy with no father who like wisdom
Preacher couldn’t save him immune to the baptism
I had no way to turn had to learn to be man
With my family on my mind then no forty in my pants
I was never [?] had a few protection [?]
Why they got a weapon killing people like it’s nothing
It’s disgusting
Like what am I supposed to do
Why we even here if only God knows the truth
I came in the gang as a hundred dollar [?]
[?] morning music trying to bring the real bat
[?] in 2016 I make mil flat
So I’m going hard with more wires in the bill bag

[Hook]
I had to give em something real
For real
I had to give em something real
For real
I had to give em something real
For real
That’s what I feel

[Verse 2]
This time we catch up to the new age
Been gone for a few days
[?] Drinking liquor [?]
[?] we go get it nigga to shay
[?] shows that you’re my dear I’m living out of suitcase
Make it home for holidays
May I ask you how the food taste
Raise up like the champion we planned it I’ma do great
Molded by the street but Jesus my life took a new shape
Time to get the world I double knotted on my shoe lace
For real

[Hook]
I had to give em something real
For real
I had to give em something real
For real
I had to give em something real
For real
That’s what I feel
That’s how I feel
(let’s fly America)
