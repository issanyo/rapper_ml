[Intro: 2Pac Shakur]
I'm not saying I'm gonna rule the world
Or I'm gonna change the world
But I guarantee you that I will spark the brain that will change the world
And that's our job
It's to spark somebody else watching us
We might not be the one's
But let's not be selfish and because we not gonna change the world let's not talk about how we should change it
I don't know how to change it, but I know if I keep talking about how dirty it is out here, somebody's gonna clean it up

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
Say she love me I don't listen
Because I'm on a mission
Momma say I'm gifted trying to change the way we livin'
Even when your pockets empty you can still pay attention
Young one had the brains I had the pain and the vision
So we had to team up, ghetto but we clean up
Goin' in until the whole world screamin' "3's up"
Rest in peace, my love bro, why he have to leave us?
I even named my daughter 'Angel' cause I need one
Life full of stress, but for my family I'll fight to the death
Heart cold, solid ice in my chest
Pay the price when you're dead
Keep it real and save the hype for the rest
Feel like Mike in the flesh
Yes, One day I plan to be the greatest
Now I'm getting famous, they keep telling me I made it
But I don't know why when my momma still cry
And my sister stressing cause she about to lose her job
Got a lot questions, every night I pray to god
Can you bless me with some wings, so I can learn to fly?
So I can learn to fly, far away from here

[Chorus]
In this life we gotta deal with evil
It's like every other night they try to kill my people
And I just wanna live (I just wanna live, I just wanna live)
We just wanna live (I just wanna live, I just wanna live)
You see the pain you gotta let it go
But will we make it to tomorrow, we don't ever know
We just wanna live (I just wanna live, I just wanna live)
I just wanna live (I just wanna live, I just wanna live)
Let us live

[Verse 2]
It's kind of hard to keep a smile when you know you got a dad but you ain't seen him in a while
Lookin' forward to the future 'cause the pain is present now
Can't give in 'til it's finished only need another round (another round)
And be proud, every man must die, so I walk in with my chin out and my head up high
Jam up lies, had to get my hands untied
Fought for nothin' I'm a stand up-guy so when you stand up, fly
We struggle to compete, help you at your lowest I'm the muscle for the weak
The government ignore us so we hustle in the street
If a nigga disrespect us, we'll bust him in the teeth (nigga)
Ha, so they think we all evil, just a bunch of lost people and they say we all equal
And now we finally got a chance, put me in the plans
This my thank you in advance

[Chorus]
In this life we gotta deal with evil
It's like every other night they try to kill my people
And I just wanna live (I just wanna live, I just wanna live)
We just wanna live (I just wanna live, I just wanna live)
You see the pain you gotta let it go
But will we make it to tomorrow, we don't ever know
We just wanna live (I just wanna live, I just wanna live)
I just wanna live (I just wanna live, I just wanna live)
Let us live
