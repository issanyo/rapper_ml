D.A did the sound ya
[Intro]
Battles! T-Lanez! We got one!

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Soon as I pull up, four in the soda
You know I'ma pull up on you
And all that we doin' is fuckin' 'cause I can't stay true
Just give me that good love, whenever I pull up
Give me that, give that, give me that good love

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
On the way to the top now
Hot now so your girl on my jock now
Calm down, you don't want to get hostile
Wrong move out your dream, get shot down
Hood chick, no class like a dropout
It's a whole damn scene when I hop out
Ride through Trey 8 with the top down
She'll put your ass to sleep, got that knock out
Absolutely, knew you was a freak when I tapped the booty
Dak Prescott how she pass it to me
Had my mind offset 'cause she 'bad and boujee'

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Soon as I pull up, four in the soda
You know I'ma pull up on you
And all that we doin' is fuckin' 'cause I can't stay true
Just give me that good love, whenever I pull up
Give me that, give that, give me that good love
Shawty, I'm honest so give me that good love
Real nigga plottin' up on ya, now give me that good love
Whenever I pull up give me that, give that, give me that good love

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
I ain't crazy, I'm just sayin', let's go half on a baby
I'm just playin', but I been patient, and that ass is amazin'
Quick fast and I'm out, only young nigga gettin' cash in drought
Baby such a freak, let me smash on the couch
Got me doing dishes, takin' trash out the house
She don't get the D, she get mad and she pout
I'm talkin' boo-hoo cryin', I65 in my new coupe flyin'
Got my ex mad 'cause my new boo ridin'
Pull up on a hater and they all get silent
Quiet, got the juice like Hi-C, tTry me, we can ball like Kyrie
5'3 and her ass on godly and I ain't been home for like 9 weeks
Only in town for the night, but you can come around if you like

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Soon as I pull up, four in the soda
You know I'ma pull up on you
And all that we doin' is fuckin' 'cause I can't stay true
Just give me that good love
Whenever I pull up give me that, give that, give me that good love
Shawty, I'm honest so give me that good love
Real nigga plottin' up on ya so give me that good love
Whenever I pull up give me that, give that, give me that good love
