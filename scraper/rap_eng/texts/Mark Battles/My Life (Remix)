[Hook]
Kick in the door like bang, nigga, bang
Going for the ring and it ain't gonna to change
Dropped PreSeason now my name in the game
So these lames looking plain, what a shame, what a shame
Hit little mama like boom, baby, boom
Raindrop emoji when you get up in the mood
Got to keep it cool
It's just between me and you, right
It's just between me and you, right
I'm just living my life

[Verse 1]
I came from a place
Where even when it hurts you keep a smile on your face
Play superman and get robbed for your cape
Pray to God keep us safe, niggas dying everyday
Coming up short but we trying everyday
I don't trust hoes cause they lying every way
Brought my nigga Dizzy to my city
All he needed was a some Henny and some fire Mary J
That's all he had to say
Go out with a bang
Blood, sweat and tears 'til they all know my name
Nah, we ain't the same, you just in it for the fame
I ask the Lord every day will he take away the pain
Red devil, no diablo
It's my time so they go wherever I go
And nah, she ain't mine bro
You my nigga we can split her like Tiago
I know I'm over heads like a slideshow
Drive slow we still fighting for survival
You know my motto
Why do it if ain't something you would die for

[Hook]
Kick in the door like bang, nigga, bang
Going for the ring and it ain't gonna to change
Dropped PreSeason now my name in the game
So these lames looking plain, what a shame, what a shame
Hit little mama like boom, baby, boom
Raindrop emoji when you get up in the mood
Got to keep it cool
It's just between me and you, right
It's just between me and you, right
I'm just living my life

[Verse 2]
Kick in the door like woah
Cuse is my nigga, swear to God, that's my bro
F.A the team and you already know
You can hit the homie Chad if you tryna book as how
Oh here we go, man we ain't tripping off that
Yeah we lost a lot but we gonna get it all back
Follow before you leave, 'bout my business
Matter of fact, every damn gain to fame just by ripping off tracks
Uh, uh, I been that nigga
Bandwagon fools tryna get up with us
Bae old news cause I been up in her
Hit it from the back like a fender bender, just playing
We just playing, ride with my team, threes up, just saying
Struggle will make you sink, was living in quicksand
Now it's model chicks take a quick pic for a big fan like
Huh? Hate us still? 2015 here, I'mma make a mil
Have the dream pay the bills, have the dream pay the bills
Learn how to play the field, showing y'all the way to build
