[Verse 1: 12Fifteen]
If it ain't Vasi I ain't fucking with it
I must admit you niggas unconditioned
You bunch of bitches couldn't muster up the competition
You either witness or become the victim
If I can feel it I mean
It's [?] for the pain in your heart
I came to make the way in you just playing the part
We ain't the same as you claim, I send a prayer to God
