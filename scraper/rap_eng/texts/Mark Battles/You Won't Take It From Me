[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
Reporting live from Afghanistan
I got 'em panickin'
Work ethic and skill level goin' hand-in-hand
Christopher Reeve playin' Monopoly, you don't stand a chance
I don't do groupies, pass the hoochie to my camera man
I'm focused
Serve you niggas like a hostess
We all try but I'm the closest
Suck me in the pool, she my blowfish, the grossest
Fly High Nation is exploding and they know it
Get my city through the door before they close it
Never gave me nothing so I treat 'em like they owe it
Show it then you gotta prove it
Fast as you got it you can lose it
So I give my all to this music
Riding for my unit
Surprise, Mr. Clueless
Gave you bums the blueprint now you stuck here looking stupid
Get it for my team, probably fighting through the sewage
Put my mind to it, we can do it, let's pursue it

[Hook: Mark Battles]
This is all I ever wanted, and now I got it
You won't take it from me (No you won't take it from me)
This is all I ever wanted, and now I got it
You won't take it from me (No you won't take it from me)

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
Every lesson learned is a blessing earned
Knew I always had it gotta wait my turn
Set the industry on fire and just let it burn
Need every quarter, dime, and dollar, pay me what I'm worth
My father never saw me and it used to hurt
Now I'ma be the biggest bastard in the universe
Whoop-De-Doo, I know you did it I'ma do it worse
I'm like a pastor in a rush, I'm running through your verse
Work: That's all I'm about
And if you start slacking off, then I'm calling you out
Put the, babies to bed and let the dog in the house
Yo, this my year to prove, getting rid of the doubt
Winning, I'm out
Mom's like "What you grinning about?"
Cause everybody had the chance, I'm just making it count
Going hard until I can't breathe
Cause a minor stampede
FA is the family

[Hook]
