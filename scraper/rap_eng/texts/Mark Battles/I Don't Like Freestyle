[Intro]
Ya'll didn't expect me to get on this beat
About to have some fun
Yeah (x7)
It's Fly America

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
That's just what I don't like
I don't see nobody
Leave 'em in my hindsight
Can't take the heat
I can see you the LeBron type
Man I'm bout to lose it
Like a virgin chick on prom night (Ugh!)
I'm Courage the cowardly dog, Mom nice
Ask him what you do for these bars, feel like I'm Klondike
My whole crew going hard now that the time's right
Chasing cheese, blind mice
People now my grind nice
Yeah, it's Fly America
Indie is my area
Causing mass hysteria
Focus on my craft cause I'm trying to buy a chariot
Running underground like Harriet, bury it
Went for a piece of the pie, yeah I want every bit
I don't believe in these guys, they just embarrassing
See ain't no reason to be arrogant
But secretly I know that I'm what's hot and I'm aware of it
I took my female out of retail
King sized bed so at night she can sleep well
Long hard road I'm just sparing you the details
Only see me one Friday just like I'm Ezel
Show after show
Flow after flow
Keep asking me to change and get no after no
My fans show me love so really man I can't stress
Always saying "Battles dude you know that you the meanest"
Cause I feed em bars like they begging me for Xanax
Plan to take over the game hope you can manage
Battles
