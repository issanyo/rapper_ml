[Intro]
Yo. I'm feeling [?]. I welcome you to "Numb" the album.This the first one, it's special for me. You know I don't really care if you look at it like that. I got a lot to say in such a short period of time so you just got to listen iiight?

[Verse]
I say life is what you make it, what's a chance if you don't take it?
What's a plan if you don't aim it? Get a pen and sign that waiver
And my friends I'm doing favours, one day gon' be my neighbours
Ten houses on some acres, Niggas livin' like them Pacers
Eh bruh give us a try, 3's up till the day that I die
Need love so I pray to the sky, Jesus I'm the greatest alive
(Make me the greatest alive)
They said "You need something for the club, for the radio?"
I said "Forget the club, the don't pay me doe"
I'm trying to make it easy for the baby's though
I'm like "Rest In Peace" to my baby bro

[Hook]
Thanks in advance for the chance, if chances speak to you
Thanks in advance for the chance to speak to you
Thanks in advance for the chance

[Verse 2]
Look, wide awake but it's still a dream
I hope you're feeling me, off the head no guillotine
I didn't have to write these things
This is coming from the soul, dirty shoes and bummy clothes
Momma said "don't love these hoes", just find a tree where money grows
Woah take it slow we wisely chosen
The nicest units slight abusive hype the kite the movement
And they might confuse it and now I came to prove it
Won't play the foolish frame the losers so these days are crucial
I remember days where dinner trays was a bag of rice
And some lemonade now I'm out here gettin' paid I'm livin'

[Outro]
Thanks in advance for this chance
For this chance
