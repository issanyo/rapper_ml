[Chorus]
I've been talking to
A man's best friend
A man's best friend
A man's best friend
I've been talking to
A man's best friend
A man's best friend
A man's best friend
And they told me, "Don't ever lose yourself"
(Don't ever lose yourself now)
And they told me, "Stay true to yourself"
(Stay true to yourself now)
So we Fly by this

[Verse 1]
Deep in my thoughts and I'm feeling kinda lost
(Kinda lost)
Regretting all the pain that I have caused
(I have caused)
I got commitment problems, yeah I know that
So even when I love you I can't show that, I hold back
Am i wrong or am I right?
And just to throw you off I come home and pick a fight
You get crazy and I leave, I go cruising through the lights
And this rugged city I call home, will I make it through the night?
(I don't know)
What a life, I'm tryna be proud
But meanwhile cancer is cutting my whole family tree down
(Ow)
I'm getting famous and I'm aware of all the changes
Blow a couple kisses to my angels

[Chorus]
I've been talking to
A man's best friend
A man's best friend
A man's best friend
I've been talking to
A man's best friend
A man's best friend
A man's best friend
And they told me, "Don't ever lose yourself"
(Don't ever lose yourself now)
And they told me, "Stay true to yourself"
(Stay true to yourself now)
So we Fly by this

[Verse 2]
Hey you
(Hey you)
Stay true
(Stay true)
Don't ever focus on the things that they do
Just to make it to the top
You know you gotta pay dues
And the hatred, it won't stop
You may have to breaks rules
But, (But) go get it how you gotta get it
(Unh)
Disregard the lies, fakers, and their contradictions
(Plz)
I'm committed to the people that's been riding with it
(My niggas)
But the fame will change your friends so it seem indifferent
(Yeah)
Am I frozen or what
It's hard to make decisions when you don't know who to trust
Wonder if I told you enough
Or too much?
(Too much)
Think it was too much
(Too much)
You see this life you only use once
(Yuh)
So you better learn from the pain when you're bruised up
(Huh)
And I ain't tryna be a preacher
No degrees, so not a teacher
I'm just venting through your speakers

[Chorus]
I've been talking to
A man's best friend
A man's best friend
A man's best friend
I've been talking to
A man's best friend
A man's best friend
A man's best friend
And they told me, "Don't ever lose yourself"
(Don't ever lose yourself now)
And they told me, "Stay true to yourself"
(Stay true to yourself now)
So we Fly by this

[Verse 3]
I won't let you go 'cuz we're one and the same
And there seems to be
A consistent thing
And I'm standing on a balanced beam
But i swear I won't fall
Gotta know you won't fall
And you won't
Just gotta know
And you won't
Just gotta know
Yourself
