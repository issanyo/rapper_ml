[Hook]
Roses are red, violets are blue
The world's going crazy, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? They say
Roses are red, violets are blue
The world's going crazy, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?

[Verse 1]
Wait, pay attention, do you recognize what's going on?
Everybody fallin' off, but my team going strong
Wonder what's going wrong, I don't really know
Ladies love how I look, fellas love me for the flow
But either way you go, they all at my show
This here, a big year, take over the globe
That's the mission, and to this game I'm addicted
Breakin' all you rappers down call 'em Mr. Fix It
Back to business, see I'm the hottest in my district
Make you play the side position while they treat you like a mistress
How vindictive, this is spiritual meditation
I'm shinin' like a gem, physical education
Critical with persuasion contemplating on how to sweep the nation
F.A. for abbreviation, behold my complete creation, ha
I'm in control of my troopers, a real titan
I feel psychic cause I know I'm the future, loser

[Hook]
Roses are red, violets are blue
The world's going crazy, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? They say
Roses are red, violets are blue
The world's going crazy, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?

[Verse 2]
Mama said "Son, you're gonna be a great man
Do everything you can approach life with a plan
Do you understand?" I replied "Yes Ma'am"
Ever since then, I've been goin' ham for the fam
The older I get, life is scarier and scarier
Breakin' through the barrier first one from out my area
But act like they don't care and stuff
Sent here to carry us, take over America?
Yeah I think that's fair enough
Speed it up guys, you chumps is some slow pokes
I'm tryna make a boatload, never break the bro code
They pray to God I'm gon' fold, promise you I won't though
Wonder why the sky blue, got the world in a choke hold
Whoa whoa, slow down, where you supposed to go now?
Fly America is profound, then took over the whole town
I'm so Yao, I'm blastin' like a Rocket, James said
"Harden your heart, but keep your conscience" I got this

[Hook]
Roses are red, violets are blue
The world's going crazy, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? They say
Roses are red, violets are blue
The world's going crazy, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
