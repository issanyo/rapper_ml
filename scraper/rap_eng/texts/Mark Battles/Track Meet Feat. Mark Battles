[Hook: Barak The Rapper]

Surfin' through the crowd
Vibratin' to the beat
Crowd stay buzzin'
Hands up on they feet
We run it
We run it, run it
Like a track meet
We run it, we run it
Run it, like a track meet

[Verse 1: Barak The Rapper]

Ready, set, go
On my ready set flow
Get the record straight
It's already set though
Underdog baby
They don't wanna bet though
Shoutin' out in public
I ain't got Tourette's though
We renting out the club
Never mind a dress code
Bring the bottles out
We never forget those
A lot of people near me
But none of 'em get close
I'm on top of the new class
As far as debate goes
A lot of politics in rap
Takin' shots at me
Well let's tick for tack
Dolla dolla bill
Yeah they strip for that
Haters gon' hate
I never trip off that
Talk to ya
Gift of gab
She wanna grab my baton
And run wit it
Up on the plate
She askin' if I'll hit it
You know you got fans
When you start to hear critics
I'm Kobe in the 4th
Puttin' on a clinic

[Verse 2: Barak The Rapper]

We run it with no brakes
No re-takes
My level so high
So high like weed cakes
Been rappin' for a while
You been rappin' like 3 days
You soft, cheesy and sweet
Like cheesecake
Not to say that I'm the hardest
Bitch I'm only bein' honest
You don't say nothin'
Don't call yourself an artist
Who's flow be the hottest
Like the valley mid August?
Me, mine, I
Yeah I'm not modest
Flow speaks for itself
If knowledge is wealth
I should have a few millions
All to myself
I don't wear big chains
No Gucci belt
Cause these rappers iced out
But I'm bout to make it melt
They ask who run it
And we raise our hands
I ask her what we doin'
She take off my pants
Ready to take her skirt off
When I'm rappin' with my shirt off
I get it, how I get it
And it's shit you never heard of

[Verse 3: Mark Battles]

Run it like a track meet
I'm a rap beast athlete
I'm on now, you was last week
That's deep, I'm too sick
Can't match Me
Cash freak, how we living
Just ask D
Nigga it's FA
We here for tomorrow and the next day
Let's say, I'm cut different
Just press play
We gon' get it my nigga
I'm headed to the moon if you wit it my nigga
Talk is cheap, bout my business my nigga
Started from nothing
And now we got it buzzin'
Plan to keep it coming
I might run it for a dozen
You can't stop it
You jockin' for the profit
To me it ain't an option
I won't give 'em a round
I run it like Christopher Brown
It's Battles
