[Intro]
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up

[Hook]
Yeah, and we back on top
Bad bitch, she down to ride, I said "Girl get that ass on top"
I'm about my bread, cash or stock
And we can't be stopped, 'til we back on top
Yeah, and we back on top
Got a bad bitch, she down to ride, I said "Girl, get that ass on top"
I'm about my bread, cash or stock
And we can't be stopped, 'til we back on top

[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
Waking up in the morning with sleep in my eyes
Like I gotta hustle, I need to provide
And my sister just had her a baby and she could have died
But she survived, and I feel so blessed
And I feel so blessed, and I feel so blessed
Haven't even been in arguments with my ex
And my goddamn text, so there ain't no stress
Uptown with a new bitch, like, man that chick so fine
I don't wanna strap up, I don't wanna pull out
All I really wanna bust, and sleep inside, right
I ain't ready for a family, so Plan B is Plan A
Yeah I ain't really with the politics, but I'll fundraise like a campaign
And no handshakes, and no crooked cats, fuck that, no looking back
My girls look like Taz's angels, your girls just look like Taz
I'mma live life fast, got the whole team with me
And if you my fam you can have my kiddies

[Hook]
Yeah, and we back on top
Bad bitch, she down to ride, I said "Girl get that ass on top"
I'm about my bread, cash or stock
And we can't be stopped, 'til we back on top
Yeah, and we back on top
Got a bad bitch, she down to ride, I said "Girl, get that ass on top"
I'm about my bread, cash or stock
And we can't be stopped, 'til we back on top

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
We gonna pass your spot, get back on top
Float out of this world like an astronaut
Think that's gon' stop? Nah
Did you broke your clock? Game on lock
Don't show no block
[?] jeans and some polo socks
Dick look like it's Robocop
Niggas wanna hate, do as you please
I ain't worried about a fake
Ground touch, squeeze out the room, out the safe
Calm as a breeze cause my goons in the place
Pretty young thing tryna move to the states
She love me, yeah, yeah, no really though
Shout my nigga Emilio, reppin' for his city bro
Uh, I'm from Afghanistan, none these niggas stand a chance
Shooting like a camera man, they don't do the hand to hand
I'm just tryna keep the peace, why they gotta feed the beast?
Throw me up a three and speak, every time you see the team

[Hook]
Yeah, and we back on top
Bad bitch, she down to ride, I said "Girl get that ass on top"
I'm about my bread, cash or stock
And we can't be stopped, 'til we back on top
Yeah, and we back on top
Got a bad bitch, she down to ride, I said "Girl, get that ass on top"
I'm about my bread, cash or stock
And we can't be stopped, 'til we back on top
