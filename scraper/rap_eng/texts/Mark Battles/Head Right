[Intro]
Fly America
3's up

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning with a lot on my brain
It's a shame, it ain't feeling the same
Am I really to blame?
A couple quickies just to deal with the pain
Gotta go, ain't got no time to explain
She said "you drive me insane"
Don't complain, just be happy I came
Heh, and so did you, so don't look at me strange
You know you cute when you're doing your thing
Mind in a maze, can't keep up with the days
I think I'm losing it (I think I'm losing it)
Gotta get back in the mix
How many rappers you know actually rich?
It's as sad as it gets
Young one got shot, so he packing the clips
And my nigga Jelly, bagging the zips
One day the madness will quit
At least I pray it would
My children healthy and I'm breathing so my day is good
I'm making something out of nothing, why you hate me, cuz?
I think I'm doing what you would have if you had enough
Yeah

[Hook]
Gotta get my head right
Gotta get my head right
Yeah, ye-yeah, yeah
Gotta get my head right
Gotta get my head right
Yeah, ye-yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Drifting at times at night, I'm deep in my thoughts
Born sinner so I sleep with a cross
Lord willing I can reap what I talk
God given but it's easily lost
She know I'm winning so she go 'til it soft
When I'm working day and night, no time for taking it off
Might be the furthest from discouraged so I pray for the lost
(Yeah) I hope you pray for me too
If you got me then I got you, that's just the way that we do
(True) That's just the way that it go
They used to prank us, now they rank us and they saying "hello"
And I'm saying goodbye, to my old life (right)
And we 'bout to be on, if it go right (yeah)

[Hook]
Gotta get my head right
Gotta get my head right
Yeah, ye-yeah, yeah
Gotta get my head right
Gotta get my head right
Yeah, ye-yeah, yeah
