[Verse 1: Trizz]
Headphones got bass in'em
Hands out wit my face in'em
My nerves bad I can't feel it
I'm so mad I stay livid
I stay trippin I hate niggas
I hate people I hate bitches
Born and raised around fake niggas
That talk shit but won't fade niggas
Fuck love no hand outs
All black don't stand out
I'm low key so don't fan out
Keep my damn name outcha damn mouth
Pull up quick to yo damn house
GPS out the damn route
I hop out go head up
I hop back in then stab out
When the beef cook I'm first to eat
First to trip I'm first to creep
I'm first to move I'm first to speak
I'm first to choose who get put to sleep
My niggas is shiesty but they with business
Yo niggas gone start it my niggas gone finish
My niggas retarded and don't really get it
So fuck who the hardest of niggas done did it

[Hook: Trizz]
It's crazy a nigga got fans now
Cuz niggas be gettin this bread now
Pull up and I get a band now
I need it all in my hand now now
I'll lay that man down
Hop out and take what I can pal
You niggas is trippin so stand down
And get up and go get them Feds now
And get up and go get them Feds now

[Verse 2: Chuuwee]
Money got me in a somber tone
Anywhere she go i wanna go
Take a flight to make a buncha dough
Stuntin on em in these summer clothes
Maybe i could buy an atmosphere
Really i just wanna chain the globe
Have the world on lockdown
They fuckin wit me every place we go
You just all talk and felatio
To make it out a small ratio
I was praying at night i could taste a check
I'm still pouring it out for my kinfolks
They holdin' grudges 'cause im back in business
You'll never know the taste of paying shows
Tryna cool it 'cause i hate to boast
Glass high ima make a toast
I promise to hop out of something foriegn
Shining till the whole bezel broke
I live buy the code of the honor system
You talkin to people who ain't the folks
Through hell and high water trying to get it
It never could fuck up my conscious tho
Got to learn to try this patience shit
Investing in you is the biggest goal

[Hook: Trizz]
It's crazy a nigga got fans now
Cuz niggas be gettin this bread now
Pull up and I get a band now
I need it all in my hand now now
I'll lay that man down
Hop out and take what I can pal
You niggas is trippin so stand down
And get up and go get them Feds now
And get up and go get them Feds now

[Verse 3: Mark Battles]
Life's crazy ain't it
No complaining just maintain it
Bread elevens with my chain dangle
Niggas wild and they gang bangin
Life is pain you ain't sayin much
Talking funds we can stay in touch
Kinda young but don't play with us
Ain't into all that ladies stuff
Nigga money talks like Chris Tucker
Fiz bundle and big hundreds???
Bubble gum but when that rain coming
Selling Chuuwee like Trizz brother
Run the game for like 10 summers
No dance music better call Mustard
Burn the bridge then crawl under
No idolize and we all coming
If you bark you better ??? some
Laid back but they all thuggin
Niggas trap you down like Paul Bunyan (or Paul Bunyun)
Throw the threes we're all rugged
Keep your hand on that Paul's button???
I'm just stayin chill
Thanking God cuz he made me real
On the grind just pay the bills
