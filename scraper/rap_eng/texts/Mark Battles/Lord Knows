[Chorus: 12Fifteen]
Can't hardly sleep at night
Can't believe my eyes
Lord knows I tried
All the nights I cried
Lord knows, Lord knows

[Verse: Mark Battles]
Remember them days in the shelter?
Orange juice, burnt toast and Hamburger Helper
Always tried to get the biggest plate, yo I was selfish
Brain freezin', tryna eat my ice cream 'fore it melted
Look, the crazy thing I was still happy
Nah, we ain't have a lot but mama made it happen
I'ma go and get you a mansion when I make it rappin'
In life, if the boat sinkin', they don't save the captain
That's the ugly truth
Use you and abuse you then they cut you loose
You must evaluate the source before you trust the proof
I wish the public knew all the things that wasn't true
Oh this world of ours
No hope in sight they go through life just like it's no tomorrow
It's just the surface, judge your person when you loathe in sorrows
I really had to go, please don't take it hard
Don't take it hard
Why you askin' 'bout my feelings? I ain't sharin' those
Why I always end up hurt? I ain't Derrick Rose
Damn, you had a chance, look there it goes
Or there it went, shit

[Chorus: 12Fifteen]
Can't hardly sleep at night
Can't believe my eyes
Lord knows I tried
All the nights I cried
Lord knows, Lord knows
Can't hardly sleep at night
Can't believe my eyes
Lord knows I tried
All the nights I cried
Lord knows, Lord knows
