[Chorus: Mark Battles]
Can I ask you a question? Have you ever been in love?
I saw you in that dress lookin' sexy than a mug
I ain't the party type, you ain't gon' catch me in the club
My heart is ice cold like Gretsky
I got a question? Have you ever been in love?
I saw you in that dress looking sexy than a mug
I ain't the party type, you ain't gon' catch me in the club
My heart is ice cold like Gretsky with a puck

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
Just a squirrel in your world, will you let me get a nut?
Drop, make that pussy pop like pepsi in a cup
Uncle Sam goin' ham tryin' to stress me for a buck
Yung One a shy nigga, he just chillin' in the cut
Quavo and Offset coolin', fillin' up a blunt
Yachty laughin', celebratin' had a million dollar month
It could be 4th and 10 and I still ain't gotta punt
I'm the shit like constipation but I still ain't gotta grunt
Live my life on the edge, now I feel like I done jumped
10 away then Coach K tryna meet me for a brunch
Must respect me as a man, don't ever treat me like a chump
I've been workin' so damn hard, ain't seen my TV in a month
But that booty so damn chuncky, baby tell me what you want
I done fought all the fighters, I wrote all the writers
My homies in the slum sellin' coke just for diapers
Jumped right off the stage and kill a nigga in a cypher
If she ain't the wifey type, I most likely won't like her
She like the dude from Ghost Rider, head is so fire
I used to be a biker, had the pegs on both tires
Now I lead the X games for my old pryors

[Chorus: Mark Battles]
Have you ever been in love?
I saw you in that dress lookin' sexier than fuck
Have you ever been in love?
I saw you in that dress lookin' sexy than a mug
You won't catch me in the club, will you let me get a hug?
Have you ever been in love?
I saw you in that dress lookin' sexy than a mug

[Outro: Brittani Jenae]
Have you ever been, ever been in love?
Have you ever been, ever been in love?
Have you ever been in love?
Have you ever been in love?
