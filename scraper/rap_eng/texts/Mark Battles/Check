[Intro: Mark Battles]
It's Fly America
Fly Amer-
Vasi Gang
Shout out too all my niggas reppin' threes
Yeah
Pistol, check
Bible, check
OJ, check
We good then, haha

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
I'm a hypocrite, I can live with that
'Cause I love me some head, but won't give it back
Never hit a hoe raw, yo that shit's a trap
Barely made it out my hood, I should get a plaque
Nigga, where my Grammy?
Ratchet little thang won't wear no panties
Face like Janet and an ass like dammit
Threes all the time, so these niggas can't stand it
For the real fly, I been known as a guy like Bill Nye
Got smoked last night, and he still high
I'm in a real dark place, yo I can't lie
Get the tour booked then set it up
Who you wanna see instead of us?
More gigs than a IPhone 7 Plus
If them niggas shoot first so you better duck
Rap like me, then you'll probably get picked
Look like me, then you'll probably get chicks
I'm so three, if you double me you'll probably get 6
Been on the grind, no ollie kick flip
Still my own boss, I don't gotta split shit
This a partnership, shout out Brenton Young 'cause we started this
Won't fall in love 'cause my heart in this
Tell Weezy put me on the Carter VI
Tell Yeezy put me on Yeezus Two
Piss out real and I bleed the truth
Only hit once and she keep the Coupe
They ain't gotta let them other niggas leave the group
Uh, au revoir
I'm really in my bag, oh God
I ain't never told no lie, goin' at they necks like a damn bow tie
I'll die for my niggas, ain't a thing change
Just got them all rings like King James
You ain't seen nothin' till you've seen pain
FA, threes up, it's the same thang

[Outro: Mark Battles]
Jordan 5s, check
Vasi hat, check
Album of the year, check, ha
Then we good, ya

Translation: Fly or Die
