You been hurt, right? It don't matter if I hit it on the first night
Hold it down, we can still make it work, right?
Keep your smile, don't you worry, cause it's just life
Cause it's just life

Hold it down, we can still make it work, right?
Keep your smile, don't you worry, cause it's just life

[Verse 1]
I got a question, why you always stressin'?
Girl, you such a cutie and that booty is a blessin'
Learn from the pain cause it's beauty in the message
Love is something strange and it truly is infectious
Uh, ha, see, I'm kinda scared of it
But every king need a queen, yeah, I'm aware of it
Irresponsible kids, nah, we ain't wear rubbers
You hurt me, I hurt you, I fear rubbers
But see, I knew that from the start
Cardiologist, I just wanna fix your heart
Quit trynna make a scene, all you do is play your part
If it show up in the light, it prolly happened in the dark, right?

[Pre-Hook]
Like life, it must be nice, and if I
Messed up once, would you trust me twice?
And for the rest of month, would you hug me tight?
Despite the fact I forgot to hit you up that night
Right?

[Verse 2]
Don't get it twisted, I mentioned all the specifics
I know they kinda crazy, they think they all in contention
Don't you make a move, I'mma prove it before I hit it
Ain't neva break the rules, don't you lose it before you get it
Whoa! I think we shoulda took it slow, but girl you know you mine
Betta let them niggas go
I was out here doin' crimes and you kept that on the low
That's why till the end of time I ain't neva lettin' go
