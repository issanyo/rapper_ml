[Verse 1]
Trapped and I got to free 'em, packin' these coliseums
Thoroughly murkin' shit, leave your beat in a mausoleum
Pocket the profit, poppin', we shoppin' with our per diem
Look how we got it, this shit ain't never stoppin'
And that's on everything
Hit the jeweler, I need Vasi Gang on every chain
I'm feeling special, 12 and Fresco blowin' Mary Jane
And I'm just gettin' started that's the scary thing (hol' up)
If you comin' to my city then you gotta check in
I want you, you, you, you and your best friend
I won't lie she blew my beast but this ain't X-Men
Set trends, Net10, soon as my set ends

[Chorus]
And that's on everything
Yeah, that's on everything
Bitch, that's on everything

[Verse 2]
I ain't ever had no love for a scary lame
I'm really about to run it up and they gon' swear he changed
A nigga flyer than a bird, I got that Larry range
My niggas drinkin' every night, they tryna bury pain
We chasin' green and throwin' threes, I feel like Danny Ainge
(huh, yeah that's on everything)
A bunch of Vasis with me, I don't come alone
Friends let me down like pedophiles 'cause they rubbed me wrong
I cut them niggas off then cut another song
Tell them haters run along, body shit, I'm comin' strong
Think it's time to show something, I was just a cold youngin'
Everyday strugglin' like Joe Budden
Really had no time for academics, was grindin' I had to get it
Block doin' steady numbers, I'm thinkin' our math was different
What's the bidness?
Can't hang with my gang, this ain't a game, this a scrimmage
There something about God, he love my squad, he made us different
Hit with slick distractions but got past it with consistance
Gotta stay persistent
Bought myself a tour bus and I filled that bitch with hoes
Opened up a bank account and filled that bitch with 0s
Weak ass label contracts I filled that bitch with nos
Yelling 3's up like FIFA, all my niggas chasin' goals

[Outro]
That's on everything
Yeah, that's on everything
3's up
