[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Keep the message in the music
I just hope you don't confuse it
We use to hang from nooses
Now we sit and make excuses
If you got it, you should use it
A product of the shootin, drugs, murder, rape, and music
I guess this is the Future
I guess this is the Future
I hope it ain't the Future
If it is, man we in trouble

[Verse]
Government watching us all they mark us more than can be
I'm sort of [?] now witness before the grammy
[?] as God come down and cure my granny
She was the anchor, now watch anger destroy my family
Just trying to keep it together
Cousins diss me on the low
Guess I'll see you whenever
What's blood without love
What's faith without hate
And it's always a debate about the money that I make
Why you worried about it?
The real question should be
Would you be there without it?
I doubt it, I won't allow it
Crowded by a bunch of cowards
Afraid to disrupt the balance
Hate when they far away
But in your face they always smilin'
Ain't it childish?
Of course I'm proud to be next
We doin' fine take our time and let the talent reflect
Count to three, then repeat gotta balance these steps
Stand in line no cash in mine
I'm writing reality checks
Battles

[Chorus]
Keep the message in the music
I just hope you don't confuse it
We use to hang from nooses
Now we sit and make excuses
If you got it, you should use it
A product of the shootin, drugs, murder, rape, and music
I guess this is the Future
Keep the message in the music
I just hope you don't confuse it
We use to hang from nooses
Now we sit and make excuses
If you got it, you should use it
A product of the shootin, drugs, murder, rape, and music
I guess this is the Future
I guess this is the Future
I hope it ain't the future
If it is man, we in trouble
