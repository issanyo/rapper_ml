We're not the same
Look at the ice in my chain
I'm doing my thing
Yeah
So picture me I'm bossed out
5 rings and 6 chains
150 on the dashboard
I'm living a dream
I'm livin'
I'm livin'
I'm livin'
Picture me I'm bossed out
5 rings and 6 chains
150 on the dashboard
I'm living a dream

Look at this life im living
Now all these groupie hoes trying to turn Robin Givens
And I ain't even big enough to have groupie hoes
But these chicks in the hood be scoping out on the low
At the shows, tryna get close to the nigga that they feel gon be successful
Get it how you live mama, I can't even hate ya
But I'll never date ya, Just fuck around and replace ya
That's how you gotta move
When you a young king outchea making moves
Never ask for fame, But it come with success
I'm just saying I'll spit a 16 on my last breath
How many rappers would do that?
Look at your top 5 and ask how many would do that?
Yeah, I woke up to a dream
Now im bout to get these ends and split it with the team
Nah mean?

Picture me I'm bossed out
5 rings and 6 chains
150 on the dashboard
I'm living a dream
