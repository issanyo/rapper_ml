[Verse 1]
Quit asking about my dad i don’t see that nigga much
I was in the streets wildling beating niggers up
Not because I’m tough more cause i was angry
Ain’t no sense in trying to change it
Sorry this is what you made me
Don’t do my business shady if you pay me then we gravy
Never left those safety fully loaded for the may be
Grindin on the daily because i have to feed my babies
This is not a gameboy Michael Tyson if play me
Don't be lazy we all just trying to earn some
Shake the hands of all my fans they telling me to burn some
When up in the raw you think i never learn none
What you niggers though now swear to God i think my turn come
World younger i don’t see these niggers like a third cousin
Gnarls bubbling claiming he is the king i never heard of
Burst bubbles winners will think we don’t know struggles
Globe hustle couples shows in europe for the snow double
No trouble We travel coach cause we low budget
My flow rugged the shows buzzing the hoes love it
The whole subject is how we do it without no funding
Don't owe nothing we really did it you gotta love it

[Chorus]
I don't need you love i don't need your love [x2]
\Cause can’t nobody love me
Why don't nobody love me
I don't need you love i don't need your love [x2]
Cause can’t nobody love me
Why don't nobody love me

[Verse 2]
I met your favorite rappers they lame
Drugs and gold chain and all the music sounding the same
The realest in the game I’m just glad I found me a lane
We supposed to be the leader quit deflecting the blame
I ain’t havin that bury me with 3 pairs of Jordans
In the platinum plaque a matter of fact
I ain't too adapted to the habitat
I”m glad i rap cause she fine and I’m tappin that
Screaming as loud as Meek Mill when i hit it back to back
Run through like cactus jack i really had to plan my
You better show the dude love I’m doing this for mankind
Implants and tan line I’m living on a landmine
I step in tantrum i got to see my fam shine
Mhhm we going to make it bro I promise you
The impossible no obstacle we doing what you got to do
Connected like a molecule respected by the honourable
Trees up into the ease up you better audible

[Chorus]
