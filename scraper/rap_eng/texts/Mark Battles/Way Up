[Hook: BoyKi & Jaay Watt]

(Way up, way up, way up)
We don't want no problems
If yo mans trippen and he lookin he just found em
All the way up, and these haters tryna down me
Keep the 3's up middle fingers if you doubt me
(way up, way up, way up)
We don't want no problems
If yo mans trippen and he lookin he just found em
All the way up, and these haters tryna down me
Keep the 3's up middle fingers if you doubt me
(way up, way up, way up)

[Verse 1: BoyKi]

Way up way up way up
Goin up a level super Mario on sega
Do it since Genesis man I kno you like the flavor
Ain't never been a playa, if she like it I won't let up
If we going, goin way up nigguh thought you had the top down
Ridin through the city let you know that this is my town
Ain't no way of stoppin, when I'm off I'm going all the way
If she want the best then it's KI and that's no debate
We gon do some things do some things you ain't never seen
Yo shawty bumpin TRM when she pull up to the scene
All the way up, fat joe and remy Ma
Yea we shootin for the stars, you in awe, dropped jaw. For real

[Verse 2: Jaay Watt]

Flying through the sky, man I swear I'm like Aladdin
I be chillin on the clouds, in an ordinary fashion
I be surfin while I'm swaggin, better hop on the bandwagon
And my foot is on the pedal, always steppin on the gas
We keep it going, we move in fast motion, you niggas should know this
And the zone lit, my nigga we zoning, the nappy hair fro picked
Whatchu say yuh, it's been a good day, yuh, I cannot complain, yuh
Where's the pay, huh, my nigga don't play, yuh, I need it today, bruh
Workin hard, I'm in the city with the brodie, midnight hours
Need some real? Here, we got plenty, make it last another hour
Aye, TRM niggas, we rollin
Aye, TRM niggas, we focused
Aye, all of my niggas, they know yuh, TRM niggas we way up

[Verse 3: Mark Battles]

Throwing 3's up like im shooting jumpers
On my way for a couple summers
Head was good should have got her number
Future legend it'll make you wonder
Oladipo nigguh keep the thunder
All the pain it just make me tougher
Instrumentals just quench my hunger
Been that nigguh since I was younger
It ain't hard to tell
And the times change
Getting money's the mind frame
You ain't up on my grind game
Just got all of my nigguhs rings
Like lebron James
You can see that my times came, like hol up wait
40 shows in 50 days
40 hoes wit iffy ways
Story goes we getting laid
Peach ciroc and lemonade, ima demonstrate
Ain't gon tell em twice
Making moves and we makin money
Keep it cool or we can make it ugly
I'm the type where they hate to love me, nigguh threes
