I've been looking out my window
In the sky, for a blessing
Praying that it all comes down
Praying that it all comes down
I've been staring out the window
In the sky, for a blessing
Praying that it all comes down
Praying that it all comes down

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
Every lesson learned is a blessing earned
And regret is like a fire if you let it burn
Became a man a little early so i'm standing firm
That success around the corner gotta wait my turn (wait my turn)
My father wasn't there at all (nah)
Once he seen me making moves he wanna get involved
And my cousins sending shots, they trying to piss me off
But you don't text me, i don't text you so we never talk (you tripping)
That's the world we live in
I run a thousand miles a month before i ever give in (give in)
But you my blood so it's love from a distance (a distance)
You want come tickets to a show you can get in (you can get in)
I don't believe in holding grudges (nah)
If you ever need me come and see me know it's nothing (it's all love)
Just a life full of questions
Listing all confessions
Looking for a blessing

I've been looking out my window
In the sky, for a blessing
Praying that it all comes down
Praying that it all comes down
I've been staring out the window
In the sky, for a blessing
Praying that it all comes down
Praying that it all comes down

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
I must admit i don't pretend to be perfect
Blessed with a lot of things when i didn't deserve it
If money is all you see then you missing the purpose
Your mind buried alive you got to get to the surface
I must admit i don't pretend to be perfect
Blessed with a lot of things when i didn't deserve it
If money is all you see then you missing the purpose
Your mind buried alive you got to get to the surface (you gotta get to the surface)
And plus love can't be purchased
If they only with you when you up, to me it ain't worth it (it ain't worth it)
I think you got to keep searching
Look up to the sky cause i know that he working
