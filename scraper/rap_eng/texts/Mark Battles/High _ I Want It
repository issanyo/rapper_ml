[Hook]
This ain’t a love song
Listen, sent you a text just because some
Said you always getting hurt cause you’re not strong
Well I can keep you high when your drugs gone

[Verse 1]
I’m scared to let my heart go
I’ll be cheating in my life so we should start slow
I think it’s time for the change maybe not though
She keeps saying we're together but were not though
Yeah I’m an asshole
Yeah Ex nigga getting froggy get ‘em tadpole
Sad lows I was going down a bad row
Had shows back to back smashing my hoes
Back I think I’m growing up
Blacked out [?] all them niggas know [?]
Never hesitate if you need to hold a bug
Next to me yell at three time to [?] it up show it up
See that my little gangster
Keep it real with that nigga so I tell it dank it
Is she always hold it down when the toss is painful
I won’t ever ever ever change you

[Hook]
This ain’t a love song
Listen, sent you a text just because some

This ain’t a love song
Listen, sent you a text just because some
Said you always getting hurt cause you’re not strong
Well I can keep you high when your drugs gone

[Verse 2]
I will never do love songs
Scared to fall in love cause I love strong
But I can get you high when your drugs gone
Will you still be here when the buzz gone
Is it real [?] should say (doubt it)
When I leave will you stay?
Can you show me the way?
[?] called me today [?] time from the gang
Yeah [?] I won’t ever love you
Cause I’ll never trust you
But I wanna touch you
You see what you up to

Say the right things so I can love you

[Hook]
