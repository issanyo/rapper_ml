[Intro: Jackmanraps]
It's Jackman...
Lysergic Thoughts...
Just keep on moving...
Look

[Hook: Jackmanraps]
Just keep on moving I'm fine
I will survive
I barley started my climb
I found a cave over here
We should go see what we find
After that I
Just keep on moving I'm fine
I will survive
I barley started my climb
I found a cave over here
We should go see what we find

[Verse 1: Jackmanraps]
Just keep on moving I'm fine
Lyrical vine
Spirits and mortals combine
Step through a portal rewind
I imported my body through time
Now it's time to go shine
I found my sense in a box
I was tense cuz' I only found dimes
Then I saw quarters, no pennies
Half dollars, no nickles, gold dollars and it was all mine
What perfect time
Upgraded all of my metal
Won't settle I'm on a new level
Like Hansel and Gretlel
Deceived by a witch or a devil
Which devil was quick to the pedal
They missed me by several, FEET
I'm gonna meet take a seat with the king of the rebels
And turn down the treble
There's trouble inside of my bubble
Let's huddle and try to be subtle
No said the rebel
You gotta fight for whats right
It's cliche yes i know said the rebel
My tongue a pretzel
I said assemble a group of some people that you might resemble
Oh said the rebel
You think that I can just go and come back with some people this special?
No said the rebel
We are not better than others however we move past competitors
UGH!

[Hook: Jackmanraps]
Just keep on moving I'm fine
I will survive
I barley started my climb
I found a cave over here
We should go see what we find
After that I
Just keep on moving I'm fine
I will survive
I barley started my climb
I found a cave over here
We should go see what we find

[Verse 2: Jackmanraps]
You won't be in first for a second
You're hooked now this verse coming second
A merciful weapon
Heard it's a curse and a blessing
We heard that you gave a confession
You lost your direction
There is only one direction
There is only one collection
There is only one collective in Flint that's accepted
Correction connected on spreading a message
Past resurrection through astral projection
A lot of complexion and forms of compression
Focusing energy right to a section
That's found through selection and deep meditation
I want it now man I'm bringing perfection
Detection of lesser will get you ejected
We're the collective that's sending a message
Yeah we're the collective that's sending an UGH!

[Verse 3: Mark Battles]
Look in the eyes of a starving man
I vow to never let you ever have my heart again
Can't decide to make a move before you start to plan
You can't decide to break the rules and try and start again
The nights is getting colder
The truth is less and less and plus the lies is getting older
Disguised him as a soldier but he really just a bitch
If i don't get my quarter back I'm really bout' to blitz
I need every nickel dime and penny
Middle fingers to them sucka' niggas tryna get me
I had a dream to ride a Bentley
She sucked me off I found it friendly
Ain't no fairy tales in this life
Nah this is real life I can show you what it feel like
Venting, Lord as my witness at night I still write
Forgiven, for all of my sins I hope I still fight for you
