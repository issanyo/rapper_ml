[Intro]
I've been around for a couple years now
Hopefully we got an understandin'
I still got so much to say
3s up

[Verse 1]
Hello world, I'm back for sure to give you what you askin' for
Quit askin' 'bout my past friends, I think its time to close that door
Lick my wounds, no open sores, it's tougher when you grow up poor
I ain't here to make excuses, this the year we makin' Forbes
This the shit they can't afford, do the things they can't see
Oh, you don't think God is real? Then how the hell you explain me?
I'm grindin' till I'm pain-free, it's FOD the Gang 3
It don't matter, rain, sleet, I'm speedin' through the lane, G

[Chorus]
Lady turn your lights on, wanna look you in your eyes
When I tell you I don't love you baby, please don't look surprised
I was raised on the crooked side, where them niggas be cookin' pies
Can't blame us for the anger, tell the judge to free the guys
(It's Fly America)

[Verse 2]
Tomorrow's feared by yesterday, tell coach its time to set a play
Good head while I meditate, throwin' 3s like Steph and Klay
And it took some time for me to set 'em straight
Them kids dream of them better days, so I won't hesitate
Now play a song and they know my shit
Love me more for every flow I spit
Lately I feel like Craig Sager 'cause everybody seem to know I'm sick
10K for every show I get and it's Burger King for every ho I hit
R.I.P. we can pour out sips, for my bros
Life is hard and I been a winner, startin' 4 we should get a center
Three's Up im authentic can't nothin' fake, Kendall Jenner
These niggas more like Kim and Khloe
Don't try to judge till you get to know me
Party hard when I'm with the homies
Done takin' shots like I'm Shaq and Kobe
Push 'em to the back like black emojis (black emojis)

[Bridge]
For the bros  (for the bros)
For my bros (for my bros)
For my bros (for my bros)

[Chorus]
Lady turn your lights on, wanna look you in your eyes
When I tell you I don't love you, baby please don't look surprised
I was raised on the crooked side, where them niggas be cookin' pies
Can't blame us for the anger, tell the judge to free the guys

[Bridge]
For the bros (for my bros)
For my bros (for my bros)
For my bros (for my bros)

[Outro]
R.I.P. Carl Battles
I hope you proud of me bro
R.I.P. my nigga Anthony Clemmens
Anthony Bryant, Josh Spiel
R.I.P. my nigga Mitch, R.I.P. Rico
Rest in heaven to Chris from up north
Beat rock, it's 317
