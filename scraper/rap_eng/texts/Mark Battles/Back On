[Intro]
Who would of thought... it would be like this?

[Verse]
The sample on this beat is so mesmerizin'
Love's a funny thing, it's hard to recognize it
I must admit it feel like love when the check deposit
My ex brought too much stress, I'm havin' sex with commas
Don't try to understand me unless you met my momma
This Battles blood is something different so don't cause a problem
Got the Yeezy's on your feet to try and show you poppin'
Yeah I bought 'em but I ain't wear 'em 'cause I know you got 'em
We ain't finna be nothing like these mini-me's
Anti-industry, I'm winnin' off my similies
Every bar Grizzly like Tennessee
Young Pac, I'ma ride on my enemies
These niggas better catch up
Can't live a life in hindsight, I'm droppin' out professor
I don't need your lectures, hope to find my peace in heaven
Was 16 with a weapon, had two TECs might get ejected
Flow is sick as cancer, couple days I go get tested
Nah I'm just bullshittin' booth with a stool in it
Verse after verse like a church, they think I'm pulpit-ing
We just want to make a livin' but this ride can take a minute
No I.D. said my future bright and I can't wait to get it
And I'm plottin' for that top spot, yeah they gonna hate me in it
Really from the mud, I ain't come up in no friendly times
Being broke? I'm scared of it, so I spend a penny wise
Clowns couldn't kill me now they dissin', bunch of Remy Mas
Nick Minaj, Drizzy vibes
Frauds livin' in disguise
It's the Vasi Gang enterprise
Why anytime I hear a beat it feel like dinner time?
Why anytime I lace a verse it feel like winter time?
Get in line, stand aside this a plan of God's

[Outro]
This a plan of God's
Fell off for a minute, now we back on
Been workin' for some years it took 'em that long
But it made me strong, yo what y'all hatin' on?
Fell off for a minute, now we back on
Been workin' for some years it took 'em that long
But it made me strong, yo what y'all hatin' on?
'Cause we back on? Now it's back on
