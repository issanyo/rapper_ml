[Intro: Chez]
Yeah
Battles, Chez
IVOVI
Look

[Verse 1: Chez]
I'm a bad motherfucker you can test it, IVOVI the team that cannot be contested
Dylan, Mac and I made a lucrative investment, team of go-getters while the rest of y'all are Yes Men

Now everybody want a piece of the boy, killing off the competition like a seek and destroy
Y'all missing something crucial I'm just seeing the void
I own the fucking label forget being employed


On that real fucking killer shit, coming up like Tiller did
Rappers getting salty I can taste it in the bitterness
Daddy in this bitch, now I'm looking for a sinner kid
Steady dropping bangers while the rest of y'all are hit or miss

Clever writing flows, you can see that I'm meticulous
Elementary rappers are looking hella ridiculous
Flow laced with laxatives, y'all about to shit a brick
The juggernaut of rap and I'm about to go and get it in

[Hook: Chez]
Make way for the juggernaut
If you know me you know that I came form the gutter, dog
Ain't afraid to let my nine make a stutter pop
Pop pop pop pop pop
Make your mama grieve another loss

Look, sorry not sorry
I want the whole thing, dude
IVOVI, I'm rolling with the king crew
Y'all bag of nickels, all about the dimes
And I keep it Ben Franklin when I sing, too
Yeah

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
It's Fly America
IVOVI, what's good
Threes

I think these niggas mad 'cause we kept it cool
One moves, step to then we set the rules
Guess who slid through with like seven goons
So fly, no lie might see heaven soon

Never gloom, I'm the realest kind of nigga
Mad I'm getting love in your feelings kind of nigga
That's the main reason I don't deal with all you niggas
My heart getting smaller but my buzz getting bigger

Say she love the way the beat sound
Underground bloodhound tear a beat down
Deep frown from my haters tell 'em peace out
You shoulda taught that nigga how to reach out

Thanks to the love that my mother got
She raised another Pac slash juggernaut
Couple thots probably praying that the rubber pops
Done a lot but won't ever get another shot
Nigga

[Hook: Chez]
Make way for the juggernaut
If you know me you know that I came form the gutter, dog
Ain't afraid to let my nine make a stutter pop
Pop pop pop pop pop
Make your mama grieve another loss

Look, sorry not sorry
I want the whole thing, dude
IVOVI, I'm rolling with the king crew
Y'all bag of nickels, all about the dimes
And I keep it Ben Franklin when I sing, too
I told you

[Verse 3: Chez]
I fucking told you
Yeah, said we the juggernauts
I fucking told you
Look

It's my turn in the game, it's my turn in it
Yeah, thanks Connor
Look

I'm about to kill the game like a massacre in Florida
Overload the hearse and send you -- to a coroner
Demons on my head and I'm the master of the corridor
Dammit I'm a savage doing damage like the lord of war

Oh shit, maybe that metaphor was too soon
Like ending my career when I was drowning in a Blue Moon
Try to make it big an get a million views on YouTube
People think I'm evil like I'm dabbling in voodoo

Oh well, man I do it just to irk y'all
Coming out of nowhere like a motherfucking curve ball
'Bout to blow a load these women saying I'm a jerk off
Told you not to catch feelings bitch that was your fault

Damn right, I'm a motherfucking asshole
People drive me crazy like I'm smoking on bath salts
Curry with the shot, man I'm making it form half court
Leave these other rappers in the dust like a Nascar
