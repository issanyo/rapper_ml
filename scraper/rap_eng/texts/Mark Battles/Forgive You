I guess it's time to tell it

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
Put it in the verse makes it easier this way
If you ever did me wrong, why let it go and fade
Was holding it all in like I wasn't supposed to say
Was told you try to get the time and let it go away
But it's not true now they ain't true
Put up a wall started out small,
But then that pain grew I had to let it all
Now hope we got the same view
My past made me who I am so in the way I thank you

[Hook:]
Promises you broke got the lies that you told
Couldn't keep it in yeah had to let it go
Since I got the chance I just wanna let you know
That I forgive you, yeah I forgive you, I forgive you
The people that would doubt, the girls it ran out
Every night my step dad would slap my mama in the mouth
Choke me half the death and try to kick me out the house
But I forgive you, yeah I forgive you, I forgive you
I'm just telling you how it was, too blessed to hold the grudge
Thank the man above now look back and then shrug
Became a man from what I've been through
So I forgive you, yeah I forgive you

[Verse 2: Mark Battles]
I don't like to say I hate you
Look we can't get through
Forgive me I forgave you, neither of us was faithful
You blame me and I blame you, life's a dirty game true
Feelings make it painful but life it gotta go on
I admire that you're so strong
You really can't pull on, hoping things go wrong
For the other person, never ends up working
One thing is for certain the lesson's served its purpose

[Hook:]
Promises you broke got the lies that you told
Couldn't keep it in yeah had to let it go
Since I got the chance I just wanna let you know
That I forgive you, yeah I forgive you, I forgive you
The people that would doubt, the girls it ran out
Every night my step dad would slap my mama in the mouth
Choke me half the death and try to kick me out the house
But I forgive you, yeah I forgive you, I forgive you
I'm just telling you how it was, too blessed to hold the grudge
Thank the man above now look back and then shrug
Became a man from what I've been through
So I forgive you, yeah I forgive you

[Verse 3: Mark Battles]
Imagine being teen watching your mama get beat
Chase down the street a gun pointed at her cheek
I know it's so descriptive it's what I have to witness,
Who knows how it would've ended, if you had not went to prison
But you in it and change, turned the God and got saved
And my mama was so amazed for me
It was hard until today, but now the hate went away
So all I wanna say, all I gotta say

All the promises I broke, all the lies that I told
Don't you keep it in, I just hope you let me know
Cause since you got your chance is your time to let it go
Hope you forgive me, hope you forgive me
