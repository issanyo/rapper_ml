[Hook]
Throwing threes, like I’m JR Smith
Thought I told em before, we gone open the door
And I know it might make y’all sick
Screaming FOD, nigga that’s all me
Whole team bout to take off quick
We just got up in the game and we kinda running things
Let a little nigga hate all this, nigga hate all this

[Verse 1]
Bandwagon fans, I don’t target those
You can have your cars and clothes, I got the hardest flows
And I’mma take this as far as it goes
And keep giving niggas bars like I’m charging phones
I don’t need a label, I can make it alone
Jim Bay how I stay in the song
Big canine, breaking the bone
Quick face time, making her moan
Switch base then I’m taking it home
Ohh, no stress you can tell I’m a beast
So hot I went to hell in a fleece, with a helmet and cleats
The real thing so they fail to compete
Had to backhand the devil cause he jealous of me
Never fear a thing, got the team on my side
When they start throwing threes and you know I’ma ride
Blah blah blah, I don’t go for the lies
It’s time to bring the real back, better open your eyes
Made it through the struggle, I was broke and deprived
My niggas bumping Boosie while I listen to Nas
Mama always said that my gift was my prize
So I’ma keep going hard ‘til they send me to god
Got the heart of a champ
And you got a piece of that if you a part of my camp
Don’t ever fix your mouth and try to tell me I can’t
Always say no, but look they won’t give us a chance

[Hook]
Throwing threes, like I’m JR Smith
Thought I told em before, we gone open the door
And I know it might make y’all sick
Screaming FOD, nigga that’s all me
Whole team bout to take off quick
We just got up in the game and we kinda running things
Let a little nigga hate all this, nigga hate all this

[Outro]
Until September
Finally bout to get that album out

Everywhere you go make sure you repping them 3s
