[Intro: Mark Battles]
It's fly America

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
See where I'm from, ain't no telling what you might see
Know a nigga that seen more Knicks than spike lee
20 sack for the right fee, she get in the back cause she digging the tracks and the tight beat
Ridiculous raps, you niggas is wack
Lyrically asked to a hype beat
Kicking the facts and its all free
The game is a mess so they call me
I'm cleaning it up, we sweeping this stuff
Go beast is a must til I'm balls deep
Dog me and I'm Beethoven
How he sleeping, leave the cage open
This a stoner nigga stay smoking
Kept it real so my name blowing
Wayne Owens, that's my nigga dog
You don't wanna see him have to get involved
If I said it, I did it all
I'm spitting raw, they sitting off, kicking off then get rid of y'all
Deal with loss, take it like a boss
Danny said you gotta pay the cost
She take it off 'cause the way I talk
I'm top of the line then I'm breaking them off
Created a loft, then get paid for my thoughts
Trace it in chalk cause I bodied them all
Stuck in the past dog you gotta evolve
Not if we strong, they hitting so hard, bullying beats, stay in the yard, making it large, hands in the air like they taking a charge
A bunch of yes men, and I'm not with them
Not too much convincing, give me 5 minutes
Had an atheist tell me my flow is god given
How could you doubt fire, rest in peace to Rob Williams
Its Battles

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Seven hundred pair of Jordans like I'm Michael Jordan
Ironic copy with your wife and scoring
Iconic nigga in that blackened Bentley
And shout out to your bitch I fucked by accidently
Black on black we pull up like somebody died
Guess its cause my girl just set the game on homicide
Photo self is foreign colored like a Easter egg
I can't even talk to Siri I think she the feds
Don't resort the violence, I just resort the islands
Got some bitches with me, bad is for your tolerance
Master in the bachelor, fuck a four year college
I go to sleep and wake up when the sun can scorch the islands, Fuck when they put me in this position, had to hit some niggas with a 40 kinda let them know I left from this position
With the trigger finger in addition got them hitters with me like a job bang
Pistols ripping, leaving niggas stiff and let the medics zip him like he bald man
Fuck are they waiting on, fuck are they waiting on
This money in hundreds, my honey be stunting and that's what the fuck they be hating on
Its paid but don't make what you niggas be looking like that ain't the motherfucking way to go
I ain't wanna be around these broke niggas that's what the fuck that I made it for
