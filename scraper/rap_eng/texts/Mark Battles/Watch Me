[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
Lord, I really need it
At church any given Sunday, really beaming
Quiet on the surface, inside I'm really screaming
Money's the root of our evil, my pocket's filled with demons
See, I'm trying to figure out
How to get rich cause the hood I'm dying to get up out
See, a lot or without, it's what the rhyme's been about
Get my mind get it up out, at least find a different route, look
See, I don't ask nothing just feed it to the mass public
Where my cash coming, they messing around like bad husbands
See me, nah, I ain't in the playing mood
Rappers better stay in school, you must got the day confused
Never chill talk or mills like I'm making food
Grind, creating major moves, I'm on that daily news
And I ain't worried about these hating dudes
Go find somebody else, no time to play with you
It's probably just obvious I'm on my grind
Y'all found it a while back I'm a wild cat like John Wall
I grind, dog, and it's making you upset
You hating so what's next, me making these bucks, yes


[Hook: Mark Battles]
Jump up in the car and we punch it to the top speed
I can sell you a little swag but it's not free
And my team don't fear cause they got me
Get a name this year, you can watch me, watch me
All ya'll, you can watch me, watch me
All ya'll, you can watch me
Must got a blindfold, you cannot see
Don't and watch TV just watch me


[Verse 2: Jay Terriani]
Watch me, you will be impressed (you will)
I'm kind of better than the rest
I done made a couple checks
Now I'm getting texts and missed calls from my ex
She say that she miss me
But I ain't trying to hear it
Always working, no time to listen
Need a couple racks if you want my appearance
I'm coming for the chair
Going to the top, then guess I made you deaf
Coming where I'm from, they don't think it's fair
That the kid pushing car that he can barely steer
My car filled with women
No more shopping under clearance
From the hood to here, it's a distance
So I'm guessing that we did it

[Hook]

[Bridge: Mark Battles]
Imma go go, go go go get it
Go go, go go go get it (x4)
