[Hook: Mark Battles]
Going hard cause the time's right
Living in the sky, see this the fly life
What you mean, when it's up to you
Me & my team just a couple dudes
& we bustin' through
This ain't nothin' new
This is what we do (2x)
We goin', goin', goin', goin', goin',gone (2x)
I said we goin', it's up to you
Said you love me, cool & I love you, too
This ain't nothing new
This is what we do, this is what we do

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
We goin', goin' goin', goin', goin', gone
& now they mad cause my whole team getting on
It's kinda sad, in the lab like Dexter
Next up, I ain't mad at the pressure
Fess up, you mad cause we better
Guess what? I don't really care
Look up in the sky you can catch us in the air
Yeah, we finna be gone
Got your girl trying to jerk, no skinny jeans on
Wanna be the king, come gimme deep throne
Ha, I major in fly, doing suicidal like they prayed Allah
I'm a favorite guy, Hercules' dad, cause I stay in the sky
No shame in my squad

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Los]

Slut be true, just be you
Would you really be tuned in to what we do?
If those bright ass lights wasn't distracting your view?
Reflecting off of my watch, I mean what's attractive to you?
The way a nigga hustle for the shit a nigga buy
She couldn't picture me in it if the picture wasn't fly
Tryna pitch to you while you walking by with your nose up
Or do you only recognize the nigga that pull a Rolls up?
Why would I buy you a Rose in the club?
If I'm poppin' Ros√©, you ain't notice it, scrubs
Dubs, shining on the whip I know ya like it
Lemme tell ya like a woman told me that was a psychic
"Son, one day the riches gone come
The picture gone switch & the bitches gone run
In your direction, trust in your protection
Then maybe one day you will love to become ... King"
