[Verse]
Ayo, the bitches say I'm sexy (ow)
The Lagerfield hopping out the Lex G (skr)
A quarter mil' for the neck piece
Don't ever disrespect me (never, uh uh)
I'll put your face on the Gildan
Bullet holes in your building
Baggin' up coke under a chandelier
Fingers crampin' up from baggin' all these grams for years
The block filled with chemist, but never passed chemistry (uh uh)
Now I pulled up on my chemistry teacher in the Wraith like "remember me?"
I'm God, bitch
The flyest nigga ever, it's big eyes on the master level
MAC-11, hit him 13 times in like 8 seconds (ow)

[Outro]
Fuck these niggas, yo
It's Flygod himself (shit too easy)
Mr. Green on the track
