[Hook]
Ayo, I hugged my plug first glance, Dolce denim and fleece
My high points ain't jammed yet, so I'ma shoot again
Drug loot on my ear, got my neck lookin' stupider
Red Bentley trucks back to back like we Lucifer (skr)

[Verse]
Chocolate 750s, can't nan nigga hit me, you hear me?
Fuck cool, I'd rather that you fear me
Extendos on everything I shoot
Gave one to Tre, told the nigga get loose
Shit debut to [?] right, how I do
Hop on the bridge, strech the shit from 1 to 2 (whip)
High [?] 3s, I was wearin' Fendi
Have a nigga trigger finger always itchy (brr)
I'll be the greatest out, the latest out
Break it up, stash it out
Stash a million in my momma house (huh)
The excellence (huh)
Benevolence (huh)
GxFR, the effortless (huh)
$2k for the kicks and them shits ugly
She sucked my dick once, now she love me

[Bridge]
She was looking for love
But I was sworn, never love a bitch
Bitch, never
She was looking for love
But I was never taught to never love a bitch
Bitch, never

[Hook]
Ayo, I hugged my plug first glance, Dolce denim and fleece
My high points ain't jammed yet, so I'ma shoot again
Drug loot on my ear, got my neck lookin' stupider
Red Bentley trucks back to back like we Lucifer (skr)
