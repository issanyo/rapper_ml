[Verse]
Ayo, 45 on my waist line
Y'all niggas just waste time
Crossed the coke over the state lines
He robbin' base on a base high
I told him, "you dead for all the shoulder"
Stashed the SK in the sofa
My chick graduated, no diploma
Turned 10 to 20, shit was sown up (wet)
Just hit Ikie on the vacay
I'm on my bullshit, Dwayne Wade
Mayday, mayday, incline, that's my A game (brr)
Eyes closed, I still had the vision
The realest of the realest listen
Even if you're broke, you better pay attention

[Hook]
Nigga, this God spitting (huh)
Nigga, this God spitting (huh)
Niggas know that I'm nice (nice)
Niggas know I'm crazy (crazy)
Niggas know I'm brazy (brazy)
Niggas know I'm nice (know I'm nice)
Niggas know I'm nice (huh)
Niggas know I'm crazy (crazy)
Niggas know I'm brazy (brazy)
Niggas know that I'm nice

[Outro]
Ow
Uh huh
The impeccable
The almighty Griselda
Mr. Green on that fly shit
We feelin' good, gettin' money, havin' fun
Eatin' good, drink good, smoke good, lookin' good
Griselda by Fashion Rebels
