[Intro]
We turn now to that other developing headline tonight. The notorious drug lord, El Chapo, who escaped months ago into that mile long tunnel, carved beneath his prison cell with full electricity and a motorcycle waiting, tonight captured
Here's the poster just released. El Chapo now caught, but it came after a bloody shootout

BRRRRR!
Fuck!

[Verse: Westside Gunn & Conway]
Ayo, I'll make sure your whole family get a closed casket
Three to the face, shit was so tragic
Got rust on the trey, but the shit classic
The rubber band wrapped around the TEC nasty
Uh shell casings on the playground
Catch a body then dip the blammer on a Greyhound
Dump the work in the acid, forty for a brick, I shot the nigga just for taxin'
Say my name on a record, I might feel disrespected
Catch you leavin' Shade 45 and strip you naked
My little nigga, 13, got two bodies
Hit the yola with the Hammer, shit too rocky
Cooker whippin' in the stash house
Two grams from every brick, he left with a half ounce
Took all his profits, went Goyard shopping
Before a nigga had the store in my locker
I'm Radio Raheem with no boom box
Chopper long as a broom, get everyone in the room shot (BRRRRRR)
Drum on the Glock, that's how the goons rock
Vuitton letterman, 350 moon rocks

[Chorus: Westside Gunn]
Fuck niggas snatched Chapo
Fuck niggas snatched Chapo
Fuck niggas snatched Chapo
Fuck niggas snatched Chapo

[Interlude]
So long, so long
