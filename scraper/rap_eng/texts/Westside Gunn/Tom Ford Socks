[Hook: Westside Gunn]
Got an 8th in my Tom Ford Socks
I don't wanna talk, you gettin’ shot
I'm the nigga in my city
'Chine gun on my left titty
Feds still tryna get me
Tom brown seats in the Black Bentley
I can make a million in my sleep
Hangin out the roof with street sweep

[Verse 1: Conway]
See how them Griselda boys manouevred it
Smell like waxin’ sour walkin out of Peter Luger
Streets consumed us, little homie loved to grip his Ruger
He 17, but he been a shooter like Dennis Schröder
Fuck nigga, look at you boy, you been a loser
You
