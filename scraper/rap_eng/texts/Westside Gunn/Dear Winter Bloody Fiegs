[Intro - Dear Winter]
(Ayo, these niggas can't keep up man)
Dear Winter
Can't wait to see you again
Hitler Wears Hermes Three
Rest in peace Machine Gun Black
Ayo

[Chorus]
My man just came home from doing twenty flat
He already back to selling crack
He look at me and said "this all that he know"
Rocking sasquatch fabrics from head to toe
The cut we was cut from it's still loyalty
Twelve gold slugs, Chanel mask you know it's me
(I'll blow your fucking head off yo...)
Twelve gold slugs, Chanel mask you know it's me

[Verse 1]
Fly as a pelican, benevolent
Drug money infectious, we whipping up extras
My man got killed for two pounds of [?]
My kicks cost that, it hurt for me to see his kids
I'm from a city where everybody got ten bodies
Burberry trench covering the chopped shottie
Niggas had buck shots in every part of 'em
Yeah they might be fly now but I fathered them
Call for neighbor dealers carving bricks
Low top Margiela's looking marvelous
Style was Cristal foul, foul as an ace
Leave 'em shot floating in it like Scarface
You broke my heart when you killed Frank
(Remember when Tony shot Pussy on the boats yo?)
You broke my heart when you killed Frank
(Seemed like yesterday I was running guns)
Ayo, Sly still got four lives left
Four leaf me to the night checks
Ricardo, lemon squeeze, fifty shot TEC
Shot fourty five hanging out the Murci√©lago
Praying for tomorrow
A lot of niggas never seen eighteen
My young boy favorite color stay green
Thirty years on the triple beam
Broke the slot machines out in Medellin

[Chorus]
My man just came home from doing twenty flat
He already back to selling crack
He look at me and said "this all that he know"
Rocking Sasquatch fabrics from head to toe
The cloth we was cut from is still loyalty
Twelve gold slugs, Chanel mask you know it's me
(I don't give a fuck who you is you ain't fucking with me yo)
Twelve gold slugs, Chanel mask you know it's me

[Intro - Bloody Fiegs]

[Excerpt from Kanye West Sway in the Morning Interview]
"I am Warhol. I am the No. 1 most impactful artist of our generation. I am Shakespeare in the flesh. Walt Disney, Nike, Google -- now who's going to be the Medici family and stand up and let me create more or do you want to marginalize me until I'm out of my moment"

I'm sniffing gun powder

[Verse 2]
Ayo one rack be yola
Them Bathing Ape Coca Cola
Dropped a tear when Ghost shot Roller
Spikes on the camouflage loafers
Lord everything kosher
Shot a hundred rounds, the whole hood woke up
Kick in the door for the raw
Shoot your baby mother in the forehead
Started off with a double up
Buck fifty your kids, they face will bubble up
Nigga, ain't nobody safe
Rose gold R8, who wanna race me?
We'll be rich forever
If the dog food tasty, I'm Azie
MCM bucket in the mall scene
No jump shots so we off king
Joakim Noah when I post up
Leave his body freezing like a cold cut
Machine got killed it had me fucked up
I ain't been the same since let me sniff
I was shackled on that bus taking trips
You broke niggas get a bottle and take midget sips
Give me a case of everything
The triple beam like a wedding ring
