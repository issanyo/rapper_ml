[Intro]
Brrr
Ayo
Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
The fly shit
I do this shit in my sleep nigga

[Verse 1]
Ayo, the graceful
Gun in his mouth like it's tasteful
Bricks on bricks like Rayful
Half a man in the safe blue, last supper, neck all chalky next to Jesus
Judas ate one, I ate too
What's the plan?
Mac-16 came with a fan
Wearing gloves when we weigh up
In Goyard aprons scraping yay up
Fold the tec like its laundry
Shocked her when the shells barely missed the car seat
Praying to the most fly
My plug talking numbers sniffing coke lines
My man killed my other man it's like they both died
Stretch 1 to 2 then we breaking them down
Making love to the 4 pound
I blow your head off, how that sound?

[Hook]
Shot him up close, the nigga brains flew by
Bye
Shot him up close, the nigga brains flew by
Bye
Shot him up close, the nigga brains flew by
Bye
Bye
Shot him up close, the nigga brains flew by

[Verse 2]
Ayo
Mac check
Tec check
Keep your chain tucked that's your best bet
Investing in the vest that's a waste
My aim bad, I still knocked off his face
I'm in the spot copping 8s by the case
Fiends gripping pipes going outer space
I got the base, worth premium
Cocaine, slashed the jeweller like they needed him
Sniff so much he went from from a double X to a medium
Add the baking soda for the seasoning
The nigga nose fell off, he copped a new one
Conway shot the black four, I shot the blue one
Nigga said he fuck with me, I never knew 'em (uh uh)
B lunch [?] all my niggas boolin
Busta go Land Cruiser cruising
V12 we had to mash on 'em, lose 'em

[Hook]
Shot him up close, the nigga brains flew by
Bye
Shot him up close, the nigga brains flew by
Bye
Shot him up close, the nigga brains flew by
Bye
Bye
Shot him up close, the nigga brains flew by
