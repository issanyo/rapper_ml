[Verse 1: Sonnyjim]

I was trouble making on my rookie training
Ain't nothing sacred, so brother, tuck ya chain in
I'm double-taking, girl scout cookie blazin
Got your girl cookie baking, tooshie shaking
Tagliatelle with the truffle shaving, I'm done playin
I'm upgrading, I'm ready for the weigh in
The red mullet's flakin, the buds Jamaican
I'm on the Caymans, a long way from my grandmother's basement
The Indian jeweller, the funk looper
The fourth quarter jump shooter about to scuba
Blunt ash on my Bermuda I'm out in Andalusia
Eat the clear pill like Bradley Cooper
20 mil chevy grill, machete kills you did a Henry Hill
Vocabulary spill I'm ill
I rock steady you pulled a John Terry, I pop the Dom Peri
God blessed me but jealous ones envy

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]

Ayo I was Panamera whippin mac 11 aiming different
Still smell the fumes in Bacon's kitchen
Waves spinnin, you fuck niggas too broke to pay attention
Your brains hang from the ceiling
Yay dealing, cops on the bloc stay trippin
The K under the robe the grand wizard
Style imperial pour Cristal on the cereal
Mask on the face like Rey Mysterio
Champagne when I'm thirsty nothing less than the thirty
Had a run in like Jackie Joyner Kersee
Never tripped on a hurdle out on Myrtle
My Brooklyn niggas murk you watch your circle
Pistol whip you black and purple shells'l burn you
Fashion week I'm next to Virgil
Dont fuck with me lord I'm too dangerous
Wipe the gets with the Hermes handkercheif FLYGOD


[Outro: Rosebudd Bitterdose]

My shit is some other shit
Pimp game you know wisdom knowledge understanding
Talkin shit swallow spit thats the kind of nigga I am
That what I used to do I still do you seein it
Right now your seein it
Pimpin hoes slammin Rolls Royce doors
All I wore is tailor made clothes
Motherfuckers fuckin with me cos diamonds is dripping from everywhere
And they wonder why i dont wear motherfuckin jewellery
Because I am a gem
Because I am a fuckin gem
