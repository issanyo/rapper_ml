[Verse 1: Mach-Hommy]
(Haitian Creole)

Unh
About winning
No, ke-ke-keep it there
Hold pistoleros for my crib, I’m not grinning
That EBT dinero for my civilized women
It’s brimming, its full before it spill, those guys timid
Extenders
Thats resting on the shelf
Look different when they ripping out tendons
We chemists
We whipping up a sale
Pies and pendants wasn’t missing aisle [?] swimming
We winning
30 percent on a house
Yukon living
Plus the women are offending
No lemons
Just a Florida Orange, it's fucking diallin', them bitches all simmin [?]
I’m really serious, what the deal is?
Smearing myself
So bring the gremlins and some infantile childrens
I bet my shoes on it, you never catch us barefoot

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]
Never...

Ayo
You know me
I’m making money in my sleep
On the cot dreaming
It’s live being free
Then I woke up to a nigga getting poked up
The nigga throwing up blood
C-O like So what?
Thirty seconds till mail call
I think wifey sent a package
Closed my cell
I put the ratchet in my mattress
Next at the microwave I’m making fried rice with Pepsi in it
At the summer league
Creased tans
The waves spinning
I bet three books of stamps
We beat them niggas by 10…
We beat them niggas by 30...
Yo Worthy you got another visit
I’m on the dance floor eating chicken wings taking pictures
I never wish to see the feds again, never
The nigga 40 got another seven
No PSI mean you telling
Another story by another felon, ha
You selling us dreams but I copped that in counterfeit
