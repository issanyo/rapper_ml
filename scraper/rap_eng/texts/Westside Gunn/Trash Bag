[Intro]
Fuck
Grr
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
Ayo

[Verse 1]
Ayo, the Glock in the Canada Goose
One shot, knocked the fuck nigga head loose (boom)
We the truth
Teaching down every weekend rules
Your neighbourhood drug lords, Patrick Moss
Meech with the 7 why I clapped the 4s
Started with a 8-ball, then graduated
Shootouts, a thousand shots, no exaggeration

[Hook]
I should've put a trash bag over the stick
I should've put the trash bag over the stick

[Verse 2]
Ayo, whip the coke like a maniac (whip)
Fieg, Mr. Max on the Yankee hat
Supreme [?], shoutout to CNN (salute)
Seein' is believin', you was sleepin' in
I was becomin' the legend by the second
I'm like Jesus, don't ever second guess me (fuck 'em)
He tryna front like the trunk ain't in the front (skr)
In Morton's, eatin' filets all month
I'm gorgeous, why my waves on spun
Your pockets like a raisin in the sun
Mine's like Creflo in his prime
I'm like Gretzky with two 9s
Boom boom boom boom boom

[Hook]
I should've put a trash bag over the stick (grr)
I should've put the trash bag over the stick
Boom boom boom boom

[Outro: Sample]
I'm tired of it
You know, what if I took this gun, right?
And blow your motherfuckin' brains out
Then you'd bleed, just like me, you lil snake
I don't care about my life anymore, do you understand?
I don't give a shit, I don't care
