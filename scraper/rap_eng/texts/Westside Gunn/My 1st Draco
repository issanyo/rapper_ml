[Intro: Unknown]
They just snake food and I wear ‘em on my feet
I run it like a running back, down to the cleats
Man, I'm fun with that, fun with bags
Play with ‘em, these double Ds
Trips on those, TTs, tatas
Over the shoulder boulder holders, you cop guys
I see ‘em over my shoulder, digger, I got good peripheral vision
Precision is him, he’s the man with the wrench in the kitchen
Uh, pay attention, it's just opposite, basic
But basic ain't opposite, the topic is knowledge, kid
I got a whole fucking-

[Break: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, grr, grr, ayo

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Sipping off-white Moet with the razor in the jaw (Ah)
Pretty lady in the loft, double Cs on the scarf
Full of greed, this is all, Genevieves when it’s warm
Put out your head like (Boom boom), MAC 13s out the Porsche (Brr, skr)
Bixbys filled with snort, Just Don legacies on the court
Heard your album, stick a fork
Don C and ready made liquor shorts
I be balling on niggas in Puerto Rico (I'm balling)
The D-girls with all of my niggas
Rocking all of my jewels, rose all on my shoes
Wearing flip flops, took the Glock 10 on the cruise (Boom boom boom)
I was there when basic shit ripped, lunatic grip
All blue faces, might buy my bitch another bitch (Ah)

[Chorus: Westside Gunn]
My first Draco (Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot)
(Ayo, man, I told y'all fuck niggas you can't fuck with me, lord)
My first Draco (Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot)
(Ayo, Virgil, I need five cases, nigga)
My first Draco (Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot)
(Yeah, just got back from Puerto Rico)
My first Draco (Doot doot, doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot)

[Break: Westside Gunn]
First thing I did was kiss Pootie on the forehead
Told her daddy ‘bout to bring home another six figures next month
Yeah, I'm ‘bout to design my G-Wagon this week, nigga
All red shit, red guts, red pedal, nigga
Fuck you, nigga

[Verse 2: Nick Grant]
Uh, chopper hanging out the window like a kick back
Kidnap your bitch, bring the bricks to get your bitch back
Niggas must be ready to die, that's a big fact
All this beef is music to my ears like a diss track
Never was the shooter, always nice with my hands
Always keeping the essence, still in spite of the trend
Brand new lights on the Benz, patience got in the win
That's why I never choose a ho without catching sight of her friends
That's game, everything you want, bitch, I’m already tired of it
Ghetto but I’m blessed because the hood is God governed
Love is blind, so this money got my eyes covered
Caught a case and said nothing like Ron Isley's brothers
Shit, fuck it, goddamn, I’m nice
Got a pocket full of money and my momma alright
My life, nigga, how real is that? Fuck off the internet
It's funny ‘cause my first Draco was the pen and pad

[Chorus: Westside Gunn]
My first Draco (Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot)
My first Draco (Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot)
My first Draco (Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot)
My first Draco (Doot doot, doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot)
