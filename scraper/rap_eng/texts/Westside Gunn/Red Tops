Griselda, by Fashion Rebels

[Verse 1: Conway]

Now look, you're nobody 'til you catch a body
My little head busta on his second body
FNH with the fuckin' drama
I told him don't leave 'til you hit everybody
For a minute I was strugglin'
Niggas wasn't real as I thought, fuck 'em then
Had to get off that couch and start hustlin'
Where your set nigga? I can bring a duffle in
Took a few losses, I accepted it
Made a few nobodies relevant
Niggas runnin' their mouth and fuckin' tellin' shit
Better use your head before you get a shell in it
Bitches tell me my dick is a gift from the Lord
I said that's the way I feel about the shit I record
Thinkin' sweet, but if I hit you I bet you you fall
Smith & Wesson 500 will break the bricks in the wall
Hall and Nash, West and Con, nigga, we upper echelon
Rap's Dez Bryant and Megatron
Hit his stomach with the blammer, blood on my canvas
Had me low in Atlanta, K with the banana
Homie this ain't what you want, that shit you talkin' only gonna get you in the trunk
Before you know it, you've been missin' for a month
Hall and Nash, yeah, shout out my nigga Monk

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]

Aye yo
The great adventure of Fresh Wes
Can't forget the tech when I dress, the Flygod in the flesh
Yeah I only praise one nigga, that's Chine Gun
Been to the Feds twice, the price to pay for a mean run
Baggin' up two packs in the Bellagio
Room service brought me 12-12 bags to run on the third floor
I don't want to sell cocaine no more
But I'll be God damned if my rims touch the lux
Brianni down in the Benz truck
Word to grab your property, you gettin' sent up
ConAir at Oklahoma, 'bout 50 niggas shackled
Trading honey bars for a mackerel
What you know about burgers on a Wednesday?
Shotgun shells where your kids play
Sandbox covered with red tops, Chine gettin' high
Street sweeper, swiss cheese the nigga
14881055, it's me live

[Interlude]

I'm a black man, and I don't know how to sing, and I don't know how to dance, and I don't know how to preach to no congregation, I'm too small to be a football hero, and I'm too ugly to be elected mayor. When I watch TV, and I see all them people in all them fine homes they livin' and all them nice cars they drive and I get all full of ambition. Now you tell me what I'm supposed to do with all this ambition I got
