[Verse]
Ayoo, brrrrrr, ayo
Cooking crack, stove Benny
Stressed out mang, I look like I
We hit it back from back, different
(BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR)
Ayo, soon as the drought watch the fiends
[?] snitched, Bo snitched
Rifel snitched - I can't fuck with them
We keep glorifying, shit dont add up
I ain't flying, your forehead get backed up
Free Wayne Perry, free [?]
Free Sly Green - thats my fucking nigga
Teaching Pootie how to read with the don's diva
Teaching my young niggas never bite the hand that feed ya
Pray for Paris, pray for Haiti
Pray for me - my ass crazy
Pray for Ike, I pray for Kiki
I pray for Sos, let my niggas be free b
You know who spillin a villain, layin on the top bunk I can touch the celling
The almighty, the legendary
Yellow [?], fiends [?]
Its getting scary
