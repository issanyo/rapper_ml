[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Slow down, West, you killin' 'em
Same nigga used to rock Fed tans and Timberlands
Same nigga used to have dope that made 'em lean
Shootouts in Dewey Park, left his brains on the swing

[Verse 2: Conway]
Respected by brick-movers and shell-bussas
Nicer than everbody on the last three XXL covers
Mix the champagne with the dark
My brain way smart
Balmains, the suede Fieg Clarks

[Verse 3: Westside Gunn]
Kel-Tec hangin' out the Corvette, shot his whole block
Black Boost match the MAC-11 by the dope spot
CDG hearts on the flip-flops, while I play the yacht, Akh

[Verse 4: Conway]
Niggas let they gun bust on my block
Started witta half, from a half to a ounce
To a big, to a 9, to a split in a drought, nigga
My cooker whip that shit till his wrist sore
I'm lookin' like a brick in the Kith store

[Verse 5: Westside Gunn]
Money got me changin', I was on the block slangin'
Prps, cherry red Buscemis lock swangin'
No skimask, we held shit up, you know what up
The Audi cost a buck, doin' a buck
Hunting shells 'a rip his guts

[Verse 6: Conway]
Fuck nigga, we aim and bang toast
I snuffed ya favorite rapper, his little angel chains broke
The plug daughter callin' me La Machina
Shot him in the hall, blew his brains on the Basquiat

[Verse 7: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, all ya niggas talkin' like you gettin' money
But y'all niggas' all broke yo
Fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you
I put the barrel in ya throat, yo
Fuck niggas can' tell me shit, I made a quater off 'a dope, nigga
Sneak diss and I'll send a few shooters at ya muthafuckin' show, nigga

[Outro: Conway]
Beleedat, nigga
Click, clack, boom, SE Gang, nigga
Fuck outta here, nigga
Hall and Nash, nigga
