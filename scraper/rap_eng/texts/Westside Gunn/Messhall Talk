[Verse 1]
Make way for the marvelous
Cop so much Ace, they ran out of sparklers, word
Pissy hallways we made the offices
MAC in his face, you swear he had Parkinson's
Niggas on the block say I'm starving 'em
Pardon my Jag
The roof I had shhhhhhh
Dapper Dan guts in the 88
Galliano sweatsuit, the little (?)
.40 caliber chrome, I shall roam
Seek and destroy niggas, demolish they thrones
MCM backpack with gats in 'em
Streets or prison, they both got plenty rats in 'em
If fly was a crime I'd be in maximum
Let me out for an hour, I might stab a nigga
Playing chess with other bosses
Made a few moves, realizing that they novice, yo
Hibachi shrimp laying next to swordfish
Gargle some Louie and spit it in ya fucking face
Enough face, let us get the plug
Roll ya body in a Persian rug, word to blood
Lanvin low tops with my two step
Smash ya favorite rapper like "who's next?"
Even if ya broke you better pay attention
Bear witness to the flyest muh'fucka living

[Chorus]
Wipe my tears with 100s
Maybachs in 5 different colors
In the mess hall politicking dope numbers
I'ma rock my tans creased the whole summer
You can never live how I live
A million in cash, all 1s, 5s and 10s
A million in cash, all 1s, 5s and 10s

[Verse 2]
Bugatti bucket on the 33
Heard Tom Ford wanna murder me
Cashmere Pumas, 'bout to serve a ki
Biggest chain you ever seen on, getting my Kareem on
That's posting
You see I'm Michael, left Fredo in the ocean
Am I my brother's keeper?
Smoking Cubans with my feet up
They was still running the race, they couldn't keep up, nah
Fed cover poses with my jewels on
30 R6 shells'll knock ya shoes off
Peruvian flake, great, let's get richer
Your work stepped on, nobody fucking with ya
Mentality is like Escobar
Fresh off the boat, the cocaine Aston Mar'
Up in Bergdorf like a fucking addict
H buckle on my arm, I got a Jew habit
Maserati jeep, I gotta fucking have it
Dana dane, buy big boats like Kane got
Me and (?) grew up in the same spot
Niggas got fly off the same pots
I'ma be forever rich, Lord willing
Billion in the floor, million in the fucking ceiling
Even if ya broke you better pay attention
Bear witness to the flyest muh'fucka living

[Chorus]
Wipe my tears with 100s
Maybachs in 5 different colors
In the mess hall politicking dope numbers
I'ma rock my tans creased the whole summer
You can never live how I live
A million in cash, all 1s, 5s and 10s
A million in cash, all 1s, 5s and 10s
