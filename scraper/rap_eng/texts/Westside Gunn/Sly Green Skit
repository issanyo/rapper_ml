[Skit: Sly Green]
The girl that was testifying, it was one my girlfriends, said that I had so much money in a suitcase, that she had never seen this much money before. Another girl said that I had so much money spreaded throughout the house that she had never seen that much money before, and they talk about all these millions of dollars. They're talking about me being the biggest guy in the history of the city and all that, but it was really based on hearsay. It was really based on the security that they were presenting to the public and I felt helpless. I felt that I couldn't win so I said that I might as well stand up for myself all the way 'til the end

So I stood up, went to trial, and in the beginning they was talking about giving me the death penalty. So they dropped the death penalty on the Rule 29. I go all the way to trial. On the Rule 29 they dropped the death penalty. So I don't end up with the death penalty. I end up with four lives and 110 on the Feds, life plus 25 on the state. Now, I'm just serving life plus 20. I've been fightin' hard. As hard as I can
