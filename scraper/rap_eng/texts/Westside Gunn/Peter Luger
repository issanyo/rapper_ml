[Intro]
Ayo
Ayo, the Ace pourer
Hold up
Ayo, the Ace Pourer

[Verse 1]
Ayo, the Ace pourer, Bentley four-doorer
My side bitch from Bora Bora
Your life getting shorter
Fiends having free work dreams
Broke pipe nightmares, I'm on my Dean
You better duck when the MAC ring
Dome shot made his hat lean
Praying on the road with fifty in the trunk
Price so good, you might just cop the whole truck
Loyalty is mandatory
My hand wash your hand, I took your 9, you took my 40
We both gotta pop him
Stash the drugs in the gym locker
Meet me up at the W, I'm telling you
Cross me and meet the devil you never knew
Show up at your momma's house shooting
Shot you down at Peter Luger

[Hook]
Shot you down at Peter Luger
Shot you down at Peter Luger
Shot you down at Peter Luger
Shot you down at Peter Luger
Shot you down at Peter Luger

[Outro]
You know something, Jim
Just to bring up some things that's happened to me lately
I was flying from LA to New York
I reserved my own first class section
The whole section?
Exactly
I had my own bus boys
I had my own waitresses waiting on me
I wanna be left alone
And lo and behold, who comes up and bothers me?
Who else?
The captain of the airplane
Wants to know, "Mr. Wonderful
Is it okay to take off now?"
Oh, come on now
Hey
The captain's trying to get your permission
That's right!
