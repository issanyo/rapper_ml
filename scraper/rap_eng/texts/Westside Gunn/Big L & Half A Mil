[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Fuck!
Yo, I'm in that CL smooth thanks to Pete Rock
Reminiscing over pots we was whippin'
Acne, Ape and drivebys out a Porsche Cayman
St. Laurent fiends sayin' that your work tainted
And my shit the bomb diggy
Fendi strap on the SK, who can eff with me
All gator strap back, relax, Supreme hoodie
Couple niggas with me got the MAC, facts
SB Dunks, Dior gloves with the pump out
I want my money now or your brains get blown the fuck out
Ferragamo water proof suit for a rainy day
Eric B jewels on, been fly since '88
Big face Reagan, mobbin' in my [?]
Allah, please let me see tomorrow
Nigga, I'm the illest
Make way for the imminent, intricate
High-top Guiseppes, I was kickin' it, killin' shit
Cristal, spillin' it for niggas doin' life
Ya'll want to be rappers, I do it cuz I'm nice
Baggin' Ray Liotta with the soda
Fiends on my Lanvin heels droolin' on the Rover
Big L with half a mil

[Outro: Big L]
Yo check it
Now here's another smooth song, so get your groove on
Violate or try to fake jax and you'll get moved on
Peace to all my niggas with the thousand dollar jewels on
Pushin' rides with foreign chicks with gator shoes on
