[Intro: Westside Gunn]
Ayo
Seein' fiends from my window
My window
Ayo

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Ayo
F-f-fiendin' for them low top Boosts
Bulgari bubble goose, keep actin' like you  bulletproof
Grew a Money tree in my backyard
Whip the McLaren P1 like its NASCAR
Since a shorty, had the 40, with the rust on it
Make sure the duct tape ain't bust on it
Watch the baby like a babysitter
Baby AK up close / All 80 hit em
Navy Ac Vigor / Who gotta go first?
This nigga or that nigga? / The grilled chicken jerk
Gotta sell more dope / Pootie need more shoes
Chrome 8 knock ya head off smooth Ooooooooooooh

[Verse 2: Conway]
Look
I know a nigga that had bricks since the Tyson days
Nigga drove a hoop, but he bought his wife a Range
Niggas rolled to the spot / He came out lettin' his rifle spray
Remember I seen him whip a brick up in the microwave
They did homie dirty / Raided his house early
It's fucked up / He in the Feds doin' 30
His bitch snitched, plus the D.A. got a statement
From like 2 niggas within his organization
It's crazy, cause he still in good spirits
Gold Margielas on his visits
He'll be home in a minute though, he chillin'
I got my name buzzin with... no real effort
Slaughtered ya favorite rapper / Oh well, F him
Niggas be talkin like killers, but nigga
I promise you I don't feel threatened
Throw shells
You sho' will catch 'em, like Odell Beckham
Flow real special
Bet'chu my lil' woe will stretch you
Told my bitch
"Do what I tell you, and The Lord will bless you"
