[Verse]
Buy art, not cocaine, I did both (Ah)
Shit so big, when I shot it, I thought my wrist broke (Boom boom boom boom boom)
The Mulsanne tip toe (Skr), crack fumes reeking off the Kenzo
You acting like you never been rich before
I been rich since 50 bricks ago, at Art Basel with the pole
Put a duffle on your head, you gotta go (Boom boom)
The pussy Feds planted me in that cell, but then I grew (Ah)
My niggas ain't even write me, that's when I knew
In the SHU, 23 and 1, no sun (Uh uh)
Soon as they popped them locks, you know what's up
Fifty books get you stabbed up
Commissary, lord, I got the last one
You in the base model, I got the fast one (Skr)
Real niggas say they praising both
My city still don't got no hope (Uh uh)
Who shot Triss up? Who shot the Groove up? (Grr)
Twenty deep below Lowes and then we blew up (Boom boom boom boom)
Rest in peace, Vino (Huh), rest in peace, Vic (Huh)
Rest in peace, Miguel (Huh), rest in peace in Chanels
Chanel ski mask, we living in Hell
You living in heaven
Tan suit, green suit, the same, I wore both
I seen the pain from the low
You ever seen blood in the snow? (Ah)
Lalalalalala, la
Just imagine the last face you see
Is your main man before he pulled the trigger, nigga
(Boom boom, boom, boom)
