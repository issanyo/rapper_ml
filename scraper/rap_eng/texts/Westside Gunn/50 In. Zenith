[Intro: Skyzoo]
Seen it like a 50 inch zenith, believe it
Ha, okay

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Uhh, easy morning like the sound of the loot
Know I'm tryin' to keep the low like the crown on the Coupe
Company is Lisa Bonet down to the groove
All type of round of applause round up the stoop
Live out the K with it
Talk or rhyme draped in it
With OGs bless the infinite, they say they gracin' it
9 to 5 forever, the last of the livin' glare
I'm tryin' to put a mil in the bank and forget it's there
If Henny turns green, I'm Raphael with a bottle
I hit a lick and flip it and divvy pies in the pothole
My brother's keeper like there's three others and they colors deep
Like if we undercover where the streets want us we
Something like nothing you heard
A bundle of words or a duffle of birds until you cut a u-turn
I send a kite up to Jehovah and thank him for all his blessings
And beg of him to bless my friends with Smith & Wessons

[Chorus: Skyzoo]
It's a war goin' on outside, no man is safe from
Where .45's and coke lines'll leave ya face numb
Seen it like a 50 inch zenith, believe it
With at least 250 on the table for the sneakers
Seen it like a 50 inch zenith, believe it
With at least 250 on the table for the sneakers
Seen it like a 50 inch zenith, believe it
With at least 250 on the table for the sneakers

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, I need Yuma's for a cheaper ticket
All praise is due to the niggas whippin'
Free Chapo, he got caught slippin'
Niggas alive but ain't livin'
You better know the difference
20 pounds on the Megabus, I'm on a mission
So many dishes in the kitchen, shit crowded
Taking bigger steps to get richer
Guy Fisher in the Off-White Pfister (skrrrrrrrrt)
Your bitch is lovin' a nigga
Frank Matthews, cash rules
My nigga been runnin' since last June
The jean suit makes it casson
Switch the loafers on the Bent'
My (?) that nigga ran flow so ignorant
(?) cuffed on the (?)
Bvlgari bucket on I'm so Gilligan
I call it how I see it
No PSI, that nigga ether
You niggas can't keep up
Banana yellow Goyard when I re'ed up
Hit the dope with the remix
Took a nine out, I'm strategic
Felix meet you in the Jeep Benz
Get a free TEC, each ten

[Chorus: Westside Gunn]
It's a war goin' on outside, no man is safe from
Where .45's and coke lines'll leave ya face numb
Seen it like a 50 inch zenith, believe it
With at least 250 on the table for the sneakers
Seen it like a 50 inch zenith, believe it
With at least 250 on the table for the sneakers
Seen it like a 50 inch zenith, believe it
With at least 250 on the table for the sneakers
