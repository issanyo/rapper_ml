[Intro]
Fuck...

[Verse 1]
Ayo, Dom Pérignon pissing
Panamera pineapple with the apple ceiling
That's fruits of our labor right?
Audemars hand flipping on my a-alike
Alexander... Wang or McQueen having dreams
Of Rosé bubble baths and drying off with cream
I need a plug like Rayful's
Addiction to Thom Browne sweatsuits
And every gold Jesús
That rusty ass trey-deuce will do yo' ass filthy
That retro Versace button up so silky
Drop head landed on the curb, I threw my B's up
TEC with the air conditioner, nigga ease up
My flow is so extravagant
Y'all niggas lacking it
Don't think for one second I ain't packing it
Immaculate, true
Style spectacular, yes
Jewelry got me all fresh
Actually I'm the best
Not a S on my chest, saw a vest on my chest
I had the McFly's on you couldn't step in my checks

[Chorus]
So here we go, yo
Murder was the case that they gave me
I killed the Hermès store somebody save me
So here we go, yo
Murder was the case that they gave me
I killed the Hermès store somebody save me
So here we go, yo
Murder was the case that they gave me
I killed the Hermès store somebody save me
So here we go
So if the devil wears Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher

[Verse 2]
Ayo, fresher than fresh
Doper than dope
So much fishscale, that the scale done broke
The Margiel's murder she wrote, Cartier loaks
Fiending [?], put the MAC to your throat
We known for crack dealing
Ferrari jeep with the glass ceiling
Fashion week, pull a gat out on Raf Simmons
Mayo jars got us famous, sporting coronaters
Picked up the triple beam
Kiss the Lord, we finally made it
I had to flush that big eight when the pigs raided
I know some dealers that been caged in since Reagan
I'm so fucking amazing
Feel the [?] when you open it
Immaculate, true
Style spectacular, yes
Jewelry got me all fresh
Actually I'm the best
Not a S on my chest, saw a vest on my chest
I had the McFly's on you couldn't step in my checks

[Chorus]
So here we go, yo
Murder was the case that they gave me
I killed the Hermès store somebody save me
So here we go, yo
Murder was the case that they gave me
I killed the Hermès store somebody save me
So here we go, yo
Murder was the case that they gave me
I killed the Hermès store somebody save me
So here we go
So if the devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
