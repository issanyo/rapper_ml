[Verse 1: Conway]
Look
I feel like I'm the grimiest nigga ever
Iron in the Dsquared leather, fire it at whoever
Retire niggas forever
Swiss cheese 'em and 6 feet 'em
We don't play fair, we fifth squeezin' / It's blick season
Wear a vest, we air Tecs
Hollows tear flesh, or I'll pistol whip you to a near death
Fuck who saw it, I could care less
I'm Prince of Bel Air fresh
I came up gettin' money on that stair set
30 shells pop, get ya bell rocked
Shell in ya top / I got this shit well-locked
Respected by the killers and niggas that sell blocks
Leave ya finger in ya mother's fuckin mailbox
Look, I gotta be a savage
Pop the chopper, you see fire on nozzle of it flashin'
My young boy shot more niggas than you could possibly imagine
Call it Hell on Earth, nigga / Prodigy and Havoc

[Hook: Westside Gunn]
If I ruled the world
I let the rat niggas rot and let the real niggas free
If I ruled the world
I take it back to '05 when coke prices was 18 a key
If I ruled the world
I rock the high top Griseldas with the aligator straps that cost a G
If i ruled the world
I keep a loaded MAC on me cause everybody gon' wanna be me

[Verse 2: Conway]
Kith sweats with the fully tucked
Shark head when I throw my hoodie up
Smell the OG when I'm pullin' up
Got whatever on the flow, nigga/ Put it up
... Big Dutch in my hand
Seen ya favorite rapper, smacked his double cup out his hand
Bet it fucked up his whole image
I'm O-Dog in that liquor store, I'm a menace
I'm the illest
1,700 for the britches
Silk shirt, the Master P Versaces on, vintage
Slime, we did it
Kick in the door, we bout ta kill it
But I will still push a nigga shit back
Don't get it twisted...
Bitches

(Hook)
