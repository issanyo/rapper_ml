[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, word to the tiger on my Kenzo
Extendo gats hanging out the Benzo (DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO)
Christian Dior jumpsuit proper though
The bitch stepped on my Fillings I should've shot the hoe
So much money came I got scared
You ain't talking code no more shit got weird
My homie laughed when he got six hundred months
He ain't care, he ran the yard from a bottom bunk
Wang draped over the pump, what's for lunch?
Mikimotos & Sotto Sotto
Twenty three you want Lord's Ford loafers hanging off the boat
Imagine them fiend faces when they got soap
You could talk fly if you want but I'm the GOAT
Season One Yeezy on the ropes
M1 fully loaded I'm 'bout to rain on him (BRRRRRRRRRRR)
Needles still hanging out the veins on him

[Hook: Westside Gunn]
Every day, make money and pray (Gustavo)
[x8]

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, bought moms a new stove Lord I killed that shit
Turned one to three Lord I killed that flip
Spinning new revolvers
Prada trunks Malibu waters
Pal tried to break Jerry King Lawler
Pulled up on the curb no top on it (SKRRRRRR)
I don't care block you reppin' you getting shot on it
I'm a man of my word
Hit her from up the block (BRRR) I was lucky as shit (BRRRRRRR)
Bust the duct tape, shit musty as shit
Niggas running from plain clothes
Talking slang when we slain those
Go back where you came from
Too many four-fifth shots should lift him (BOOM BOOM BOOM)
I thank God I'm still living
I'm 'bout to be rich forever
Ten chains HumanMade Sweater

[Hook: Westside Gunn]
Every day make money and pray (Gustavo)
[x10]

[Verse 3: Keisha Plum]
If Rakim and Nicki Giovanni did the nasty
They would've had me
Product of poetic genius DNA
Seven one six in my DNA
Every day make money and pray
Holy Father, he said pay attention
Uncle Stevie got his throat slit ear to ear
Word to life nigga's still breathing though
Spiritual atonement, dreaming of angels
But living with demons
In one 911 made OTC, in the jungles of the Philippines
You can never clean away the odor of sin
His gut filled with gin
Her skinned dipped in Gucci bamboo
Hunter boots and Woolly socks
For thunder and rain, tears shed in Medellin
