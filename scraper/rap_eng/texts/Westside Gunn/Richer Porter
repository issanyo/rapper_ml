[Verse 1: Conway]
Pyrex pots and baking soda by the boxes
Still got rezzy from the last time, bitch didn't wash it
I'm up all night, got the stove rockin'
Cold water runnin' in the sink, look how that soda lock it
I watched niggas spend the profit on watches
Now it's my turn to get the money / You just sit and watch it
Like some bitches, you just sit and gossip
About the shit I got in pocket, Don C-Bills with the bottle rockets
Huh.. Took a lil' minute, but I got it
Laughin' walkin' in the bank when I make deposits
My weed is exotic, my bitch is a goddess
Jimmy Choo on her shoe, Birkin bag, ostrich
I said "Daaaamn, how is you that pretty?
You remind me of Keisha on New Jack City
If I need a nigga peeled, she'll do that quick
I ride out? She'll do that with me

[Hook: Westside Gunn]
Dope boys get all the bitches
