[Verse: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, parked the La Dalat in front of Guggenheim, I'm selling 2 for $5s
Coke swimming, we had to scuba dive (ah)
Craig Green gas, sold my first mack at Christie's
Pulled the Draco out the Chevy door and shot up Tiffany's (skr)
MAC got his niggas looking like he got his brains blew
Fur on the Gucci loafers, Lord, you see the ankles
Rosborough pullovers, I'm rapping like two HOVAs
Your coke too soda, these three stripes too Gosha
I'm bagging ten 10s, rocking [?]
Chanel Paris, don't get embarrassed, the TEC in the fridge
Daniel Hertz, gold in the kitchen, you know who I'm is
April '77, take these bricks to your ribs (ah)
Wipe the blood off my mud rats, fuck rap
Goggles Isabel Benenato, chop your head off, the rest'll follow
You can't fuck with it, John Lawrence Sullivan
Bucket flip, 14 gauge with the rubber grip (boom boom boom boom boom)
Put a whole through your Yankee MOMA, woah (boom boom boom boom boom boom boom)
Bought the whole shelf of baking soda, woah
I'm Hannibal then, Shoe Surgeon Tinkers with the animal skin
You couldn't handle my pen, sin (ah)

[Chorus: Westside Gunn]
Give me two bricks, I'll stretch it to five
I'ma stretch it, I'ma stretch it to five, to five
Woah, give me two bricks, I'll stretch it to five
I'ma stretch it, I'ma stretch it to five, to five
Woah, give me two bricks, I'll stretch it to five
I'ma stretch it, I'ma stretch it to five, to five
Woah, give me two bricks, I'll stretch it to five
I'ma stretch it, I'ma stretch it to five, to five
Woah

[Outro: Rob Johnson, Irika Sargent, Mai Martinez]
Developing tonight, this Kerry James Marshall painting, once on display at McCormick Place, has a new owner
It caused quite a stir last month, when it was announced the painting, bought for $25 000, was expected to sell for millions
CBS 2's Mai Martinez watched this Sotherbuy's auction live online, and Mai, it did not disappoint
It certainly did not, Rob and Irika
The painting was expected to fetch between 8 and 12 million dollars tonight
Either of those prices would've been a record breaking sale for a Kerry James Marshall painting
But it actually sold for much more
