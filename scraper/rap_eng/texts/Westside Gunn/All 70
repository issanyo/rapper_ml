[Intro: Benny the Butcher]
Yeah, uh
If this don’t wake the streets up, I don’t know what will
It’s Benny
Griselda
Uh, this my life, nigga, I’m still front line
I’m still front line, nigga

[Verse 1: Benny the Butcher]
Yo, I put the truth on every page I jotted
I slang narcotics from the steps of my crib, my mom complained about it
I weighed my options, persuaded by the chains and watches
Only if you saved your profit, you obtain them objects
Shoeboxes to bank deposits, and I’m thankful, honest
Uh, ‘cause I’m to my city, probably what Dre to Compton
We started off gram coppers, now we land shoppers
Rubber bands popping in my Balmain pants pocket
First I opened up a trap, then I franchised it
Taking chances with the niggas I played with in sandboxes
My flow street smart and toxic
Life of a vet, Griselda, write us a check, we’ll get your brand popping
They gon’ label us the greatest regardless
We been through worse conditions so that made us the hardest, uh
These niggas aiming like that made us a target
Bag full of straps, that’s like two hundred pages of charges, uh

[Chorus: Benny the Butcher & Westside Gunn]
I’m riding with my fourth felony
I know niggas with bodies who talk pleasantly
It’s 50 in the drum, 20 in the SIG
And if I’m lucky, you catching all 70
(Uh, brr, doot doot doot doot doot doot)
(Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom) Catching all 70
(Brr) It’s 50 in the drum, 20 in the SIG (Brr, boom boom boom boom)
Catching all 70 (Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot)

[Verse 2: Conway]
Look, still spit it the hardest, ain’t nothing changed
I drink a cup of pain while I fluff the 'caine
You a sucker and a lame, we ain’t the fucking same
A rapper mention my name, I’ma bust his brain
Yeah, every nigga from my block a savage
Rob and popping ratchets, dropping caskets, we are not your average
I got shot in my top but it ain’t stop the passion
I just got up and got shit popping, I kept dropping classics
Eight hundred for my Versace glasses
Teaching my youngins how to break up the bricks, call it karate classes
Drop the top on the Aston out in Calabasas
Bitch ass so fat, she hopped out and it stopped the traffic
Huh, I was just at NOBU eating lobster with Jasmine
Racks and pocket diamonds in the watch was flashing
Talking crazy, nigga, I know how to stop the madness
I’ma just have El Camino pop his cabbage
They ain’t give me shit when they was rapping blocks in plastic
Now they hurting and I’m up, they had to watch it happen
Get out of pocket, nigga, watch what happens
Choppers blasting, shots not stopping ’til your top get splashing
Griselda, we ‘bout to lock this shit
It’s funny how niggas hating on my accomplishments but ain’t accomplished shit
See, I’m a real nigga and you the opposite
The whole summer, my young boys chopping shit
Griselda, nigga

[Chorus: Benny the Butcher & Westside Gunn]
I’m riding with my fourth felony
I know niggas with bodies who talk pleasantly
It’s 50 in the drum, 20 in the SIG
And if I’m lucky, you catching all 70
(Uh, brr, doot doot doot doot doot doot)
(Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom) Catching all 70
(Brr) It’s 50 in the drum, 20 in the SIG (Brr, boom boom boom boom)
Catching all 70 (Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot)

[Outro: Benny the Butcher]
It’s 50 in the drum, 20 in the SIG
And if I’m lucky, you catching all 70
Woo
It’s 50 in the drum, 20 in the SIG
Nigga, catching all 70
