[Intro]
La musica de Harry Fraud

[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]
Champagne sipping at night letting my thoughts settle
Looking scholarly, but still my niggas talk metal
Friends became associates, switching like foliage
While holding money, I decipher (?) and only this
Working the Samsonite, couple thousand grams tonight
Rest in peace my nigga Will, we getting paper still
Responsible for residue that's on ya dollar bill
Over pouring, fuck maturing, let that bottle spill
In the Tropics or in the drop six
I'd rather cop kicks than pop clips, either way I got this
Peace to niggas out of town that's doing block shifts
Chop the rocks with a rock wrist
Scrape the uni out of the shell like the coke out the plate
When the story's said and done you can quote that I ate
Seven colors on my sweater at the bodega with cheddar
Shorty bagging up my bundles rocking Bottega Veneta, it's life

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, horses in the money blue coupes
Big horses on the Rugby too
Bust down Trump, that's presidential
Fiend hit the pipe said my shit official
The work butter
I'm from where niggas serve they own mother (aaow!)
Chanel weight getting cheaper
Take a 3 for 25 mama (mama, mama)
Take a 3 for 25 mama (take a 3 for 25 mama)
Take a 3 for 25 mama (take a 3 for 25 mama)
She ain't done, smoked the whole cheque away (smoked the whole cheque away, smoked the whole cheque away)
She ain't done, smoked the whole cheque away (smoked the whole cheque away, smoked the whole cheque away)
Macho Man got the belt wrapped around his arm (aaow!)
Take a 3 for 25 mama (take a 3 for 25 mama)

[Outro: Westside Gunn]
Them other niggas got that bullshit
Fiends want they money back
They wanna shop with us... aaow!
