[Intro]
Ayo
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
Ayo

[Verse]
Ayo, Air Max
'91 Off-White Air Max
Rockin' Palm Angel jumpers on Fairfax
Facts, two thousand grams on the neck, we fetch
My connect said he need thirty a piece
On Versace rugs, praying to the east
Allah, when I'm 200, let me die in the sleep
Maserati jeep, Maison Martin seats, pardon me
Stab three niggas on the tear, who hard as me?
Commissary killers, I could be home soon
He said, "West got the Bentley truck and lit the whole spoon"
Fell out, woke up ten minutes later
Shootout at Del Frisco's, won't tip the waiter
You ever count a mil', then count it over just to make sure?
Elevator stuck, threw a brick from the eighth floor
Supreme box cutters from OG Ma
KAWS x Snoopy a hole in one
Fly girl candy-painted
Niggas got dressed for school but never made it
On the yacht with Ronnie Fieg talking ASICS
Bell hall [?] massacre, it was karma
Bitches get pissed on, so raise your daughters

[Outro]
Lalalala, boom boom boom
I pray to be fly as OG Ma (brrt, brrt)
Box logos on box logos like OG Ma
On tour, spend it all with OG Ma (brrt)
Niggas wanna be God but it's only one
Flygod
