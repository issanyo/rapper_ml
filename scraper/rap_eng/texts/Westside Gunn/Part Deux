[Intro]
Mr. Green
Peace
It's the Flygod himself
Lalalalalala
The luxurious
Lalalalalala
The Almighty
La
The gorgeous
The exquisite
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
Boom
The incredible
Enough about me though

[Verse]
Ayo, white stripes on the black supplies
I pray to stay fly and alive
Homicide on top of homicide
Where I reside, don't shit slide
They say power went to my head
I could've fell back, put a shot in his head
Could've aimed at his legs, but I knocked off his head
Fly as fuck in the streets, fly as fuck in the feds
Now the money green, go [?] for the bed
Now the coupe 'bout a mil and a half
Now my bitch got Stella on her ass
Grand on her soles while your baby mom's trash
How many bricks in the stash?
Wore Ricks but my mind was on Rafs
Reverse the whole wave like Sonny in the Jag
Nigga, it's the return of the mack

[Hook]
This shit feel like Hitler 2
Motherfucker
This shit feel like Hitler 2
Ayo
This shit feel like Hitler 2
This shit sound beautiful
This shit feel like Hitler 2
Free all my nigga, too
This shit feel like Hitler 2
Peace to where I'm from
Shit, pfft, yeah
Peace to all my niggas getting money
Yeah, this shit feel like Hitler 2
This that Griselda shit, nigga
Ow
