[Intro: Ric Flair]
And I gotta be the best of 'em all
Not just cut and dried
I'm the best, whether you like it or not
You're looking at, wooh, the greatest
The best looking man
The best dressed man
Long limousine
Jet airplanes
Custom made chrome
And any woman in the world I want
Just like that
You know why?
Let's face it
If you're not carrying the big gold
You're second best no matter what you tell yourself
So gear up, ladies and gentlemen
Get used to it
Wooh, you're looking at the man
Wooh

[Scatches: Westside Gunn + Samples]
The almighty
The legendary
Westside
Hallow be thy name
Are you really ready for Flygod himself?
You're looking at the man
Wooh
My name golden, nigga
My rep is impeccable, nigga
I'm not to be fucked with
You can't buy this
It's Griselda homie
Spectacular
The luxurious
Griselda
I tried to tell you homie
My whole team bought to win
Ain't nobody stopping that
Flygod
Flygod be the illest
In VIPs sharing couches with villains
