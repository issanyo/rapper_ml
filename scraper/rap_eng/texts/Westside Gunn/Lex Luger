[Intro - Conway]
Yeah, BRRR
You know what's up nigga
Machine bitch, Daringer
We back at it again boy
You know this shit easy to us
Griselda (Griselda)
We gettin' money nigga

Look, my neck on Slick Rick bitch yeah I'm the ruler
Watch is bluer rock the muller watch that I just copped from jewelers
But I come from the bottom, I'm straight up out the sewer
Drug dealer, chop pursuer, pot consumer I been through a lot
I'm just a cognac drinkin nigga, a Glock user
Top remover, and yes that baby tec it got the cooler (brr)
Them hollow tips they get to poppin thru ya
Take my shooters out to eat the waitress bringin lobsters to us
Like i said, fuck your covers and your list
Long as that Rollie bust down, lookin disgustin on my wrist
Plus I'm luggin the fifth out in public with the blick'
My shooter close, he can't wait to start buggin with the stick
Might catch me in LA, smokin dutches with my bitch
Came a long way from trap, kitchens fluffin up a brick
Look at me now, I bet them other suckers sick to their stomach
They see me poppin they wanna cut they fuckin wrist, damn
Pardon me, this moon rock's got me coughin
With a bitch that I just knocked from Broston
She gon' top me off and then
An Uber drop her off and then I'm back to jottin raw shit
You pussy niggas cop us off
And this 30 pop ya at your top then I'ma knock it off with
Everything I drop's the hardest
That's how I knew I was gon pop regardless
Bars like the shit outta the choppa cartridge
Scope aim and beam on it, and I just spot my target

The cuban .... key, you see the rolex
The phillip mint duffle full of fold up tecs
Trap kitchen, paraphernalia nigga
Bodies on bodies, this Griselda nigga
The cuban .... key, you see the rolex
The phillip mint duffle full of fold up tecs
Trap kitchen, paraphernalia nigga
Bodies on bodies, this Griselda nigga

[Westside Gunn]
Ayo, rockin the ferragam' fifth drop, yo
Been backin all night in my bitch spot yo
Look at the crystals my fist got yo
I whipped that shit til that shit block yo
Ten millimeter in the Simon Miller
Rhymes is iller, your life's real but mines realer
In the attic up, hundred pounds in a vacuum sealer
Perignon spiller, Oscar de la Renta
Truths heavy it's the, most incredible
Grease stains Timb boots up in federal
Black ski mask in your bushes
PO want shit, all he wanna do is cook us
Yola on the Foreman got me lookin gorgeous
Just left the lot with my bitch, we copped twin porsches
Just left the lot with my bitch, we copped twin porsches

[Benny]
Yo, uh
I used to run my block with fiends with hundred shot machines
Could've got the grease but ended up, in Comstock in green
The kicks fake, but the top Supreme
We went on shopping sprees and he ain't want shit, just a Glock to squeeze
Sprayin tools off, while I'm shavin thru raw
I cook my first half, in a baby food jar
The fiends kept callin, it was takin too long
Now I bag a whole block, off a plate that's too small
Yo, a couple zips don't make you a hustler
They go from ten to 30 bands when they make it thru customs
Catch me racin thru in laser blue Tesla
With Griselda on the plates, hundid K in the duffle
Scary shit, the boogeyman carry sticks
The plug said he's bout to touch down, like Larry Fitz
Rappers sayin they gon shoot that up and bury this
Til' his momma go identify him by a pair of kicks

The cuban .... key, you see the rolex
The phillip mint duffle full of fold up tecs
Trap kitchen, paraphernalia nigga
Bodies on bodies, this Griselda nigga
The cuban .... key, you see the rolex
The phillip mint duffle full of fold up tecs
Trap kitchen, paraphernalia nigga
Bodies on bodies, this Griselda nigga
