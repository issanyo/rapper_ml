[Intro: Lil Eto]
Yo, woah, yeah, 6, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Eto]
Pop trunks, get the top bunk, you only die once, the coward lives
I'll die with a thousand grams while letting the powder fizz
That’s how it is, let Mr. Shade vouch
Yo, fuck that beef shit, that shit is played out
Beef is when all of them pass, easy like a walk in the grass
They keep telling me money talks, go and talk to your cash
Got all of that stabbed, same farce as my dad
Rest easy, pa, I'ma be parked in my bag
It gets greasy, right, a hard day make it an easy night (Yo)
Gotta visit the homie before he reunites, right (Si)
I ain't seen him in a double
It’s still the same place since we was in the huddle, nigga

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, rocking Billy, smoking billy, peace to all my billies
All these berries, got the biggest vein up in my bity (Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom)
Kill your Ballys, Balenciagas got me looking bigs
Be 30 on me, fresh manicure, trigger finger itchy (Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom)
Thousand dollar plates, you niggas never ate (Ah)
I drink a different kind of grape
I blast, nigga, MAC-11 on my bitch too (Grr)
Blientele blassic, Uber mounted on a big spoon (Ah)
Nina Chanels in my living room, Sean Price, MF DOOM
Niggas on the borner, everybody wooping
Heard somebody shooting, AK-47 (Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot)
Blow his brains out, way we booling (We booling)
