Look
Smack your favorite rapper's teeth down his fucking throat
Gun big enough to sink a fucking boat
Wash the lobster down with a cup of pain
Ice on my wrist like it was fucking sprained

[Westside Gunn]
Just copped the Rollie with all ones
Mustard Goyard duffel with all guns

Mustard Goyard duffel with all guns

[Conway]
Play the corner 350s is pirate black
Young-in like to fire his strap
I admire that

[Westside Gunn]
Fire MACs
Frying panda cracks
Stone River jumpsuits, Supreme Air Max
Throwing head cracks

[Conway]
Throwing lead, blow his dreads back
Gave my lil' shooter the go ahead
Go ahead, push homie head back
Don't compare stats
You won't never find another flow and pair that
Flow is near crack
As ours
At all

[Westside Gunn]
Its 6 in the morning and still whippin'
First day in the yard a Latin King ripped him
First day in the yard a Latin King ripped him
We hid the burners in the kitchen
800 worth of commissary for extensions
Leave your front missing

[Conway]
Killa Tome? like Mad Max he just want victims
Banana clip stick out the side of the sticks
My jit will slide on you quick
I let him fire the blick

[Westside Gunn]
I was only 16 going half on the stick
Then I turned 19 went half on a brick
I had a 40 in the 40-below you're just a fix
Ask around I'm the shit

[Mach Hommy]
Ayo wow
I see what it take now
Inteligencia on some Balenciaga shit with a tre-pound
I bet your bottom bitch is a playground
No interrogative, no pot to piss; that cause a nigga to spray rounds
These niggas is brave now
Griselda poppin' and my opposition about to get it beret style
Mach Griselda fatigue top
I heard your knees knock because you food like you fell off a tree top
I'm rude like the scale up on Detox?
Forget the beatbox
Got the news chopper trailing the g-rock?
We two timers headed for three times
Your self esteem dies
When y'all puntas get wet up for green dots
That's word to the flowers on the PJ
I flip the raw fish like ceviche
I'll get your song lit like a DJ
West get me to hit your dawg shit like I'm Wee-Bey
I whipped the Rolls [?] on the freeway
The Corniche was malt liq with the seats flake
Dutch Vanilla
Glue is gorilla
So what the fuck them gawn do when Griselda come through they favela?
No more debating about which crew is the illest
You want a plate you gotta wait in line
My A&R shoot up your building
I got the Bape Shark Chew and I'm chillin
I got the Maison shoe with the suede all through the acrylic
