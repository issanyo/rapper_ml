[Intro: Narration + Westside Gunn]
Ayo, listen here, bitch
You come at the king
You best not miss
Peace, peace
It's the Flygod himself (lalalalalala)
The almighty (lalalalalala, la)

[Hook: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, a blind man can see that I'm rich
Ran through every brick from the first to the fifth
In mess halls reminiscing on crack flips
We never seen shit, nigga, stick to the script
They say, I'm looking like the greatest lord (like the greatest lord)
They say, I'm looking like the greatest lord (like the greatest lord)
They say

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn & Conway]
Ayo, I had the MAC up in Max Field's
Gave the chauffeur a gat, it's that real
Started off with ten tan bundles
Off white my clan bubble they fake love you
In the streets, that's why I pray all day
War with the mob we gon' spray all day
Just say the word I'ma make sure they all pay
Count it by hand, shit take all day
To my niggas using Corrlinks hold your head
Remember Chine Gun used to piss in the bed
Remember hot dogs getting boiled for the party
Off White fatigues, Lord, Griselda's the army

[Hook: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, a blind man can see that I'm rich
Ran through every brick from the first to the fifth
In mess halls reminiscing on crack flips
We never seen shit nigga stick to the script
They say, I'm looking like the greatest lord (like the greatest lord)
They say, I'm looking like the greatest lord (like the greatest lord)
They say

[Verse 2: Benny]
Yo, bulldog, rubber handle, hollow tips barking
At the round table having candid convos with bosses
It's me, nigga, the fifth sparking, slick talking, brick tossing
Dirty money stashed in the dish washer
Ex-con saw us pushas trying to dodge booking
The fiends outside the trap will smell the raw cooking
But you gon' die from all that hard looking
My little homie start pulling and pick you off like Charles Woodson
I know some old heads who still carry blades
To each his own, I got some shit that's military grade
You gon' need a hearing aid after you hear it bang
Flash so bright from the muzzle I should be wearing shades
I'm involved in some shit that you could tell illegal
Drove him up from Tucson in an El Camino
At the Seneca hotel casino
Top floor, we selling diesel, you a middle man, I'm El Pedrino
It's all love if they spoke in his name
Cause I float through my city like the ghost of Rick James
No matter what you do in life you posed to get paid
They say we going to be the reason the culture gets saved
On the road to riches and Europeans
Might find yourself in a position only bosses be in
Politicking so the signals never cross between us
Cause it seems like a lot of shit lost its meaning, uhh
Haters wanna outsider bash your city
And lust will have you going broke at Magic City
I think trust is what Puff Daddy had from Biggie, uhh
And love is what Doughboy had for Ricky
Gotta listen before you speak, the streets taught us how to watch
Balls tight enough to squeeze water out a rock
A knock down'll get you ties with Italian fellows
Metal Glocks, gloves made from Italian leather
Took a little bit of Beans, Nas, Styles, and Mega
Sparring rounds, I buckled down and got my style together
I know B's, I know C's, and niggas that's neutral
Learn when you keep it real that most niggas salute you
Some shake your hand turn around send niggas to shoot you
Spin the block, Rugers pointed out a all black Isuzu
Dead bodies popping up we not discussing that
Never fearful just careful where we get dutches at, ahhh
