[Verse 1]
Come here bitch
Let me change your life
Ayo
Ayo your pussy like Da Vinci paintings
[?] while you standing naked
Your pussy taste so good
Like some watermelon Jolly Ranchers
Finger fucking in the Lam
You like to lick it off my hand
Baby girl you the truth
Look at that walk in Jimmy Choos
You look so smooth
We fuckin like we still young
I let you cum and then I cum
But you played me for a fool
Introduced you to designer shit
J.W. Andersons
Chloe sandals and shit
You just a gold-digging bitch
All gold Zanottis
We started fucking in the lobby
Then we took it to the big house
Come over here with that big mouth
I heard you fucking for a bag now
Stupid bitch
I heard you fucking for a bag now
Can't stand none of y'all bitches
I heard you fucking for a bag now
I had a set table for two bitch
I heard you fucking for a bag now
I got you the iphone 7 bitch first day it came out
You's a stupid hoe you out here fucking for bags and shit
Kids still got school kicks from last year but you fucking for a bag
Fuck your baby daddy too bitch
Might get that nigga stabbed the fuck up up north nigga
Fuck y'all I want my money back
