[Verse 1: Westside Gunn & Conway)

Aye yo, I had to [?]
Basquiats in the bandos, we tasteless

S.E. Gang, hammer on the waist
Shit, leavin' the club wasted, waivin' it in niggas faces

Louis reekin' out my fuckin' Porche
Sweepin' coke off of marble floors

Madusa head on the buckle, shit
I came with the semi-LV's on the luggages

Blood bottoms with the spikes on it
Canary choke, par, pink ice on it

Fresh new MAC on the dresser chillin'
[Watchin' Run's House, daydreamin' 'bout Vanessa Simmons](8860099)

Playin' chess on the luggage
So now these unzipped match the [?] bucket

Smell the dope on me at the little homie graduation
He caught his first body, told him, "congratulations"

Rockin' minks at the Broner fight
If the four pound donâ€™t then the chopper might

How the fuck you 'gon do me harm, nigga?
I'm surrounded by shooters, I'm Lebron nigga

Shootin' like Curry nigga
Do you like Flip when Birdie ripped him

Two .45's on me like Jimmy Jump
MAC in the Reagan era, bag in the baby's trunk

Python on the Just Don
Fendi dinner plates with the Gold Bond

Twistin' up the gas in a Versace store
Spent so much cash they gotta lock the door

The SLS coke white
Free Sly Green, they gave my nigga four lifes

This the kind of shit the game miss, hurricane wrist
In the kitchen whippin' up a cocaine dish

Stop [?] at the dice game
Catch him in the yard with the knife gang

Niggas ain't fuckin' with my night game
Forty for the Hublot, that was light change

Couple MACs in my bitch Birkin
Throw him off the roof now he fly for certain

And bitch I want all the cash
Conway, Westside Gunn, Hall and Nash, nigga
