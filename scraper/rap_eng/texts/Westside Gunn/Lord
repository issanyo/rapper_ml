[Verse 1: El Camino]
Yo yo yo yo
I remember them nights
Hoodied up, ratchets tucked, niggas knew what it was
Come through looking suspicious, you catching a slug
We won't let you shoot first, that's a dub
Clapped you just because
Mama, love her, have a fit if her son got hit
Lost his life in these streets, serving skaters out that navigator tryna get my weight up
That bulldog barking if you try to play us
The wig shot made him raise up
The lord couldn't have saved him, I just blazed him
Had to raise [?] just to cut the raw shit
My wrist flawless, my bitch flawless
She pissed off 'cause my other bitch panties was in the whip
When the coppers semi on us, then took her to Benihanas
Then broke the bitch something proper
I spent a few dollars, but it was worth it
Threw that dick in her cervix, the bitch squirted
All over my Versace sheets
All over my Versace sheets
That's thousand dollar sheets bitch

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, whippin'
Got stoves on the ceiling
Stoves on the Bape sweatsuit, coke dealing
My nigga's PO kept calling, tryna piss him
Now he got another 5 years in the system
Got 3 kids, they don't even know the nigga
Be in more shit, now you want to poke a nigga
Not one nigga put money on his books
Whip game crazy, niggas hit me just to cook
Everybody know me
I had to switch my number like Kobe
VVSs and the Rollie
You don't wanna know the old me
Catch the family at the [?] teeth
Dropped him on Filmore, I deal more
Griselda, I rob, steal, and kill for
Got these bitches on my heels, lord
