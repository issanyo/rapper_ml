[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Another day another dime, another way to kill some time
Another tester to the crowd, point blank at the sublime, another way to get us paid from orchestrating up a line
And the Genius annotation and debating with the blind
Word to SAMO, and my accolades from up off of Legos
And day ones who get you your shipments in Winnebagos
The penning of the God like a scene by the seed of Matilda
And Gerard or the lift of a Chopard
My records is over nighters that turn into over never
In hands that'll hold you second like I'm lifting a Chopard
Two up outta one, automatic the entendres
Or two up outta one like taking talcum on a prom date
It's grey bottoms for the city in here
And grey bottoms for the biddies in here, I got you love
I been one of one from day one, top 3 where I came from
Basquiat on the draw you see where they got their trace from, right?

[Chorus: Skyzoo]
It sounds like Basquiat on the draw
The price tag got Kukoc range
The loop so straight
All of this can flip from the door
It's outlines on whatever you want
It's Basquiat on the draw
"Basquiat", "Basquiat collab..."
"I'm the new Jean Michel"
"Banksy bitches, Basquiats"

[Verse 2: Conway]
Look, try to cross the mob that ain't smart at all
That type of shit'll get you pussy niggas carted off (facts!)
Look in your eyes and see you ain't got heart at all
You ain't hard at all, legs shot and tell you walk it off (hahaha!)
Homie, you was all talk and talk is small
Now that you shot and you bleeding you wanna call the law
I heard this shit Sky, I ain't know how to start it off
Fuck it, told my son Zoo I'ma write the Art of War
I'm SAMO before the heroin
Listen, lyrically we ain't the same and ain't no comparison
Robbed him and shot the nigga, what I did wasn't fair to him (HA!)
I guess I'm Kobe, I crossed him but I was carrying and still shot it
Fuck the talking I don't hear that
Had niggas running out their Nikes when I air MACs
Basquiat on the draw, I'm top 3 where I came from
Matter fact I'm Machine, I'm top 3 in the game, one (Conway bitch)

[Chorus: Skyzoo]
It sounds like Basquiat on the draw
The price tag got Kukoc range
The loop so straight
All of this can flip from the door
It's outlines on whatever you want
It's Basquiat on the draw
"Basquiat", "Basquiat collab..."
"I'm the new Jean Michel"
"Banksy bitches, Basquiats"

[Verse 3: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, who you know fresher than West, riddle me that?
Same nigga put my whole city on a map
Same nigga put a couple bodies on the MAC (brrrr!!)
'05, Evisu jumpers on, selling crack
Every week fly to see loot or a new chain
Touch mine, this .45'll knock you out them Flu Games
(Boom boom boom bo-boom!!!)
My nigga this God in the flesh
Monster Fendi loafers, body dropper in the vest
Hold up, I hold the pump, gloves Mulberry (Mulberry)
Crossover the coke like Marbury (Marbury)
Disrespect, get your fam buried
The Simmons don't come out 'til February
Me and Skylar watch the money pile up
You raised the bar, you wack niggas time up
Hell gone, I'm the new legend
Let me squeeze, off you in a millisecond (brrrrrrrrrr!!!)

[Chorus: Skyzoo]
It sounds like Basquiat on the draw
The price tag got Kukoc range
The loop so straight
All of this can flip from the door
It's outlines on whatever you want
It's Basquiat on the draw
"Basquiat", "Basquiat collab..."
"I'm the new Jean Michel"
"Banksy bitches, Basquiats"
