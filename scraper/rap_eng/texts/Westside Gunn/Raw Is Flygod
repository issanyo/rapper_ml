Up in Freddy Jay’s rocking ready-made Bentley Barry made
Carry [?] triple deck yacht stocked with copper plates
Chopper, yay, shop at Maxfield for half a day
Fiend hit it once he passed out, he thought he passed away
Bag of flake, wrapped in duct tape, let the pump wake
Half a chicken, all white, with crushed grapes
[?] for fuck’s sake
He owed the Mexicans 20 books, they hit him at 8
Me and QB taking pictures for his wife in case

Hit him with the lock in the sock he going nighty night
First day home with some more beef - nighty night

[Verse]
You know who it is, Fish Fish rolled on my ribs
One way window [?] on my big [?]
Went from semi to fully (I went from semi to fully)

Niggas at the corner store raised us
Fiends licked the leftovers off the razors

Headshots, left his glasses missing
All gold Glock like gold dust, hold up
Drive-bys out of road trucks
You know who it is, know what it is (Know what it is, nigga)
Lil nigga 13, shot him for his [?] bucks
Niggas can’t fuck with us (Niggas can’t fuck with us)

[Hook]
My best friend got a hundred shots
Flipped his whole fucking block
Can’t go to sleep without my gun
Flygod, it’s the Holy One

[Verse 1]
You was just backing up blow, huh?
Point the draco out the Rolls, huh
My whole fucking [?] is frozen
Used to chop franks and Spaghettios up
Now we sharing Porterhouses
Breaking bricks to quarter ounces
Ten thousand dollars for the outfit
We dug up McQueen, this ain’t out yet
Baby tecs for the family
Lift him off his feet like [?], how can it be so simple?
You know my handle be ringing bells on the yacht, y’all panicking
Set the bar for those [?]
Frying crack pan on pans
Niggas know my dance
Ayo, niggas know my dance

[Hook]

[Post-Hook: Scratching]
I’m pulling wrestling moves
On competition

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I dreamt about a Benz and then I copped one
Violate the gang and get a hot one
Getting to the money, ain’t no other option
I do this for my niggas in the box that’s locked in (Free ‘em)
I do this for my niggas on the corner, hustling for they sons and daughters
I been ahead of the time, niggas copying my style, hostile
Gold rush, it came from my scale
Life’s a beach, bring volleyballs
Salvador Dalis on the walls
Too much soda, y’all niggas is over
Takashi pillows all over my sofa
The devil’s trying to hold us
Feds trying to get a close up
Chine Gunn, Mary and Joseph
Just because I’m supposed to

[Verse]
Raw as me
Raw as me
One hundred round drums, what the fuck you mean?
We gonna get richer if the dope is clean
[?] the top rope, it was all a dream
Time to dream in a cherry Beamer
Only heard the shots, he ain’t even fucking seen ‘em
Everyday I pray for Sly Green’s fucking [?]
Ike bout to touch down, can’t wait to fucking see him
Kiki home, I just seen him last night
Boost has got Louis bags for half price
I’m not nice
Prime time, in his prime, he can’t pass mine
I hit Mike and Paul like it’s bag time
Pootie can’t eat air
Spending drug money from last year

[Skit: Announcer & Ravishing Rick Rude]
I’ve got a lot of very confident individuals here at the World Wrestling Federation
One that comes immediately to mind is Ravishing Rick Rude
Now recently, he had a Post Down with the Ultimate Warrior
I think we all know who was announced the winner
Ravishing Rick Rude refuses to believe that
He still believes he has the best body in the WWF
Hi there fellas
Remember me?
If you don’t, just go into the kitchen, get your old lady out, and she’ll tell you who I am
She’ll tell you I’m the sexiest man alive - Ravishing Rick Rude
And how do I know this?
Not just because your old lady tells me this
But because I put the Ultimate Warrior to shame in the Super Post Down
And it won’t be long until you see the sexiest man alive with the title belt around his sexy waist
And for all you ladies wondering about the Rude Awakening, I have raised my standards
I now come to town with the bear size 5 Calvin Kleins and a 36DD
And if you don’t fit the mold, don’t dream of the Rude Awakening
Comments from Ravishing Rick Rude, quick to list his attributes, which include not only having the best body in the World Wrestling Federation
But let’s not forget, the sexiest man alive

[Outro]
Raw Is Flygod!

Part Five

[Intro]
Flygod

[Pre-Hook]
Still digging in the crates
Bullets digging in his face
Celebrate every headshot
Pour Ace on the cherry Wraith
Dinner plate full of pure, got 10 [?] in the Kate Spade store
Waiting for the yayo store

[Verse]
The mac in the Hermes [?]
Holding hands, walking SoHo
Designer life, we got an appetite
[?] with the Flygod, that’s facts of life
Nebraska Off-White
I can eat your pussy all night
Lounging in the Calvin Klein 2-piece
Get you [?] off the lot, only 2 seats
Play the city, talking sex
Out of everybody, you suck it the best
Got my pedicure queued up
I ain’t gonna lie, you fuck my world up
We can have 5 kids together, God forbid if I do a bid, we bid together
Now that’s love
You like drugs
I love you like I love my plug
Look in my eyes when I cum
Is that your real hair? Red on the bottom, is that a real pair?
You make me want to buy a ring
We can chill and do our thing
Take trips to see your family
You taste just like candy

[Pre-Hook]
Still digging in the crates
Bullets digging in his face
