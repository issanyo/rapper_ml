[Intro]
His spirit moving
His prays are ever near
That's how I know he's real
In my heart I feel
That's how I know that God is real yeah what's more

[Scratches]
"I hear it in my sleep sometimes..."
"See I can see the sound of my glow..."
"Rhyme nice..."

[Chorus: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, I never gave a fuck, never will
Hit him 18 times, he did the windmill
My nigga wrote me, said he heard I'm out here killin' shit
I put a grand on his books [Flygod]

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, Madonna sucking Basquiat dick up in the spot
Hundred round drums, fuck around and get chopped
Starin' at the turquoise Marilyn
Told my little nigga to bag 20's, it's imperative
40 in the jawn undercovers, the 'caine doin' numbers
Lose my work whippin', I'll leave your brains in the oven
Splash paint on my Christopher Kane jumper
Crash the Mulsanne, I copped the plane last summer
The watch plain Jane, but it still cost 60
Ran up in the spot, stole base, Ken Griffey
Blood-stained Persians, wide body's got curtains
TEC just jammed, I just left it, shit worthless
In the law library, tryin' to get time off
Prayin' five times a day, tryin' to get five off
Crush Doritos on this wheat rice and turkey, lord
I wore my blues to the shower, razor tucked in my jaw

[Chorus: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, I never gave a fuck, never will
Hit him 18 times, he did the windmill
My nigga wrote me, said he heard I'm out here killin' shit
I put a grand on his books, look

[Verse 2: Benny]
Uh, could've told my story on Oprah, 60 Minutes
How I earned plenty digits from risky business
What you know about a stint? Gotta sit for Christmas
Wifey on shit, that bitch missing visits
'Cause we was stretching white like Richard Simmons
Caught a case and the nigga pled the 5th amendment
Yeah, you know the whip be rented and bricks be in it, uh
And I'ma get this chicken 'til my clique get sentenced
I need a stash in the wall that whole 90 pies
Word to me, I've been live since '95
Took a trip to get the bag like 90 times
Yeah, you got it from your plug, but it's probably mines
All I needed was a trap spot, scale and a plate
I ended up on a flat cot, cell upstate
Now I really need a black Glock, shells and a tank
Yeah, the shit'll get uglier than Welven Da Great
D's kicked in the door and snatched the four pound
My man paid ten stacks just to blow trial
Now he callin' home, tellin' the crew to slow down
I'd be rich if I knew then what I know now, uh
Livin with regrets and I'm still willing to bear it
Plus the shoe fits and I'm still willing to wear it
It's hard being a family man with interference
All the women and them trips to prison ended my marriage
I grew up with the few damn crooks that baked work up
Who used to have food stamp books and case workers
Me? I'm way further from a place you ain't heard of
Where you get rich, die trying and face murder
Where your best friends start to switch when the case surface
Where it's hard to trust a man who ain't nervous
I fell asleep with a 50 grand in a locked apartment
That night, I had a dream like Dr. Martin, woo, yeah

[Scratches]
"I hear it in my sleep sometimes..."
"See I can see the sound of my glow..."
"Make them say that I'm God..."
"Rhyme nice..." [Flygod]

[Interlude]
Big money, big money
Big money, big money
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You got big money, you got fancy cars
Everybody knows you, it's like you're a trap star
You're breakin' down bricks, choppin' up O's
Breakin' down bricks, choppin' up O's
