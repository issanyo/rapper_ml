[Intro]
Griselda, by Fashion Rebels

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Aye yo
Name another doper than me, I'll wait [uh], the great [uh]
Wore Velentino, we're more straight [uh]
The A.A. heroin great [uh], soufle and yay [uh]
Wash the money with [?] [uh]
Prayin' five times a day over big gates
Smash the metal on the plate
The ghetto never settle, young boys thinkin' that they mellow
Shootin' everything, now they're stressin' up an echo
Politic ditto, birds in the rental
Fuck that, might take the work in the limo
Gave the uzzi to the driver, I'm liver
Hopped out lookin' like Moschino or MacGyver [Griselda]
You fuck niggas don't know the half
Rozay bubble bath, yo what's today's math?
Thousand dollars for the belt
Put the ice in the pot and watch it melt

[Hook]
Ain't no money like dope money [dope money]
Tell Virgil I need that off white [off white]
Tell Virgil I need that off white [off white]
Tell Virgil I need that off white [okay]
Ain't no money like dope money [dope money]
Tell Virgil I need that off white [off white]
Tell Virgil I need that off white [off white]
Tell Virgil I need that off white

[Verse 2: Conway]
Aye yo
Name a nigga doper than me, I'll wait
That's what I thought, now get the fuck out my face [uh]
I only want what's in the safe [uh], fuckin' with me it ain't safe
Police bringin' yellow tape
A wrapped Swisher and the reef
My bitch is Paula Patton in the face
Kaman shell below the waist
$300 champagne you'll never taste
Told the chef make sure he butterfly the steak [uh]
The A.A. heroin great
O.T. cook a couple birds a day, call him Bobby Flay
Griselda dinner plates swingin' over pots
We came a long way from sleepin' on the cots
Used to bag $20 rocks listenin' to LOX
Glock on the table cocked, I had to get it off the block
Tell a cop to suck a cock
Peace to Fahim, peace to my nigga Monk

[Hook]
Ain't no money like dope money [dope money]
Tell Virgil I need that off white [off white]
Tell Virgil I need that off white [off white]
Tell Virgil I need that off white [okay]
Ain't no money like dope money [dope money]
Tell Virgil I need that off white [off white]
Tell Virgil I need that off white [off white]
Tell Virgil I need that off white
