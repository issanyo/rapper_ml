Part One

[Intro]
Ayo
Ayo

[Verse]
I crush whoever I want, I'm like that
My nigga doing 50 sending kites back
You heard such and such got shot
They say the fly nigga did it with the nice watch
Coke white 350 Boosts
I'm George The Animal Steele, you like Steel in Juice
Pussy get shot and won't do shit
I hit you broad day, I'm a nuisance
With the rock, I'm like Penny in Blue Chips
Just rolled a Dutch up in Ruth's Chris
Valet drooled on the Wraith
It's all kinda tools in this Wraith
I had the MAC plus the Glock 40
If they pull us over, give it to shorty
He gon' take it like a man
Commissary fat, when you come home you get 100 grand

[Break]
Woah, woah, woah
Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot
Woah, woah
Doot doot doot doot
Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot
Woah, woah, woah
Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot
Woah, woah

[Outro]
See
This is what the fuck we do
Getting money
Taking trips
Fucking bitches
Drinking champagne
Shoes cost so much I don't even tie the strings, nigga
Just take 'em out the box and put them shits on
Don't even know what the fuck they called
I just know what they cost

[Skit: Sample]
He's gotta be the happiest man in the World Wrestling Federation right now
Jimmy Hart, come on in, [?], you're the intercontinental champion
And from Reno, Nevada, Jim the [?]
The former football great from Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Brett "The Hitman" Hart are the tag team champions of the world
You know, the paper says, everybody says, the greatest team in the history of professional wrestling today
I guess you could say we are the in crowd, am I right, [?]
Haha

Part Two

[Intro]
Griselda
By Fashion Rebels

[Verse]
Coke on the plate
Coke on his face
Take one sniff
Shot the whole place
Niggas talking drugs
Thirty for some [?]
Kicks cost some racks
I ain't ever going back
Fuck your CEOs
Fuck your POs
[?] on the Rolls
Rose gold stoves
Money, cash, hoes
No top ropes
Fifteen minutes
[?] hit me
Oh five five
Did that time
Ate like a king
Get your shoe shined
Ate like a king
Get your shoe shined
