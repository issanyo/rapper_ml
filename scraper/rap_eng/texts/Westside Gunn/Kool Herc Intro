[DJ Kool Herc]
The less coverage you get on it, the more innovation coming on it
So it's always gonna be, "Why? Where this come from?"
The less we show them, and the more brothers like you wanna dig into it
It'll come, it'll rise up
Everything ain't gotta be put out there right away
You know, something, something that just happens has a way of nourishing and coming up
That's the thing about hip-hop, man
It's forever innovating and forever changing
