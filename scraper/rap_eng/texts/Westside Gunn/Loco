[Intro: Westside Gunn]
Ayo
Ayo

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Tiff stones in the anklet
White [?] with the T4 handkerchief
These fuck niggas make me sick
Plug looked me dead in my eye, said, "I'ma make you rich"
Cop Cris by the case
Whoever thought they was taking over gotta wait
I'm sliding off, rocking Prada skates
You better do what this yopper say
My whole team dealing flake
Seem like we just can't get away
My man violating, he couldn't catch a break
[?] say you hard headed, nigga, now take another 8
Hibachi steak and shrimp, that's all we ate
Kiss Pootie on the forehead, daddy be home late
Annihilate if you violate
The i8 looking berry grape
The i8 looking berry grape

[Verse 2: Conway]
Look
Ayo, slime, who we gotta spray?
Point 'em out, they getting shot today, they gotta pay
Yeah, Griselda, bitch, that's how we operate
From the home of the drive-by's and chopper plate
I got the bag and my posse ate
Lobster and steak on Versace plates
Jimmy Choos, I rock those eight
Peace to them gangsta niggas in Far Rockaway
Free the homies behind the wall, locked away
'Cause they was moving a block a day
Stand up niggas, they ain't cooperate
Having niggas clapped in the yard, this youngin a chopper fates
Talking buck fiftys and neck scarves
Talk a buck fifty for my next car
Who can fuck with me when the tech draw?
Fuck nigga, this is GxFR
Griselda
I fuck with lil homie, we on the same page
He caught two bodies with the same gauge
Two foreigns inside, was the same suede
The .30 tucked in the Balmain [?]
I'ma spray it if I have to
Don't compare me to these niggas, I ain't no motherfucking rapper
I'm the reaper, I'm just reaping the benefits of this rapping
The flow is Ether, reaching, I will clap thee
Pussy nigga, there is God and there is Flygod, praise both
Chopper engage close, motherfucker, for my brother, I'll spray both

[Verse 3: Inkredible Nes]
[?]

[Outro: Sample]
Oh, I'm the man who walked on water
And tied a whale's tail in a knot
I taught the fish how to swim
Crossed the burning sand and shook the devil's hand
I rolled around the world on a [?]
[?]
I walked 49 miles of barbed wire
And I used a cobra snake for a necktie
[?] the women pimp
The women fight for my dinner like
I am a bad dude
Johnny Ripsaw, the devil's son in law
I gave a highway patrolman a speeding ticket
And sold a blind man a flashlight
I am the only man in the world who knows why white milk makes yellow butter
I even know where the lights go when you cut the switch off
Now, I may not be the baddest man in the world
But I'm in the top two, and my father is getting old
