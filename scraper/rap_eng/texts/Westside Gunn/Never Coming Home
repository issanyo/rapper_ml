[Intro: High Fashion P]
Chasin' Ferraris, but these Russian bitches is chasin' Bulgari
This ain't a game of Sorry, it's the game of Life
And you don't get three strikes or no nine lifes
But the strike to your face is so vicious like the cat did before he had rice
White eyes, we split them keys boy, white pies

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
All this wax got me feelin' so high
Givenchy plaid got me lookin' so fly
$3000 for the kicks, on the cot still thinkin' of flippin' bricks
Wave the Heckler out the Tesla
So much dope, Pyrex couldn't measure
Fiends 'round the motherfuckin' bando
Doors up on the four door Lambo
I sold my soul for a thousand plates
If they ain't see our face then we fuckin' straight

[Chorus: Tionna D]
Me and you ain't the same, nigga, I got mine the hard way
I got fiends in the hallway, this enough to get us in four way
If the Feds come and get us, we ain't never comin' home
[No, no, no, no, no]
If the Feds come and get us, we ain't never comin' home

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]
Ferragamo shades at night, Cavalli smellin' like china white
Jesus piece is layin' on the Ferra', God
Phillip Lim bucket on baggin' hard
Goin' fishin' off the fuckin' yacht
Back the fuck back or you gettin' shot
I'm from a city where there's false hope
Pistol whip the nigga 'til his jaw broke

[Chorus: Tionna D]
Me and you ain't the same, nigga, I got mine the hard way
I got fiends in the hallway, this enough to get us in four way
If the Feds come and get us, we ain't never comin' home
[No, no, no, no, no]
If the Feds come and get us, we ain't never comin' home
