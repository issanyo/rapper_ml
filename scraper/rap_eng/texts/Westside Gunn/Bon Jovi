[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Ayo
Money green MAC-11
Money blue Tec's
We chopping in the duplex
Running around like who next?
Pump in the London Fog 2X
Hit the kitchen
Gave that brick a suplex
Cartier's in vision
Water whipping, slaughter viscous
Fly bitch on the bottom
Sippers clocking chicken
Walking over water
Suede Giuseppe's never wet though
Cuban links on top of Cuban links
Make my neck glow
Mommy said I'm special
I hit the block with the best dope
So many chains I thought my neck broke
Phenomenal rap nigga we rocking those
Fill a blem, duffle smell like Papito's
Come there got shown
Drive past doing donuts playing Donuts
Told her stop looking pretty bitch, roll up
Fiends on my leather heels, chill
Niggas sniffing fish outta thousand dollar bills, ill
I'm fresh and impeccable
I'm stressed stretching out the coke
Like Frank I gotta catch that boat
I need a new plug
Fashion week, got that Jimmy Choo love
I think it's true love!

[Chorus]
I've been looking hard as fuck
But ain't nobody fucking with me!
Everybody talking fly now
But ain't nobody flyer than me!
Skywalker got me in the sky
But ain't nobody higher than me!
Violate then you gotta die
And ain't nobody shooting but me!

Look at the sun
See how it shines on our eyes
We were never meant to see the truth in their eyes
All your life they brought you to believe in those lies


[Verse 2: Benny]
Come through and wack the block
Then double bag the watch
When them niggas had the top
I was tryna crack the pot
They was tryna strech the truth
I'm just tryna stretch the coupe
Buttons in the steering wheel
Which one adjust the roof?
Talking 'bout my life but
What I say affect the youth
Everytime I hit the booth
Just respect the naked truth
Yo watch my wrist, catch the flu
Giuseppe shoe, electric blue
F's on my belt and shoes
F's on my record too
Niggas face time and tell
That's why they say time will tell
Tryna stash what I but for real
Like tryna hide a whale
No I never signed a deal
Nigga I'm just signed and sealed
Lead fly, my home fire the steel
I sat behind the wheel
Movies like Tarantino
Pull up in the Benzino
I just fuck her throat
You love these hoe's like Benzino
Cocaine buying out, Gucci store trying out
Champagne spilling like I'm tryna put a fire out

Look at the sun
