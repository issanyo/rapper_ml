[Intro]
Peace
It's the fucking legend himself (lalalalala)
The Flygod himself (la)
The Almighty
The Merciful
Enough about me, though, nigga
Fuck these niggas, man
Fuck about none of these niggas, man
I could make a blind nigga see
You ain't fucking with me, fuck you, nigga
Ayo, it's Griselda, nigga
Griselda

[Verse 1]
Ayo, kiss my rosaries
Face in Prada hoseries
Shot the first ten niggas I seen
So you know it's me
I'm in the cell reading Dutch
Wipe the prints off, it's a must
'04 on the run
I'm Big Smalls, L and Pun
Gave my features to my son
Margiela gloves on the M1
Y'all niggas bums
No commissary, no funds
My name golden, nigga
Got your bitch open, nigga
Hit the kitchen like Nitro
Leg drop the brick like Hogan, nigga

[Hook]
I'm nasty
(I'm telling y'all, I don't give a fuck about none of these niggas, man)
Yeah, yeah, I'm nasty
(I'm hearing these niggas' shit, I'm not impressed, man, I swear, yo
My shit dropped in March, niggas I'm already on my second one)
I'm nasty
(Mash up, my third one, nigga, these niggas can't fuck with me, nigga)
Yeah, yeah, I'm nasty
(Y'all need to hang that bullshit up)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Sample]
Oh, here we go
The Outsiders in the ring
And they are hammering away
They're hammering away at Luger, who is all alone in there
This was a sneak attack
They're closing
They're [?] with Hulk Hogan
The scourge of the wrestling world
[?], there's no yellow, there's no red, he's wearing black
