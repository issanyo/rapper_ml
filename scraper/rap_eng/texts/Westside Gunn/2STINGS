[Intro: DOOM]
One, one, two, two, two

[Verse 1: DOOM]
Keep your mind on your mask, kid
Holler for my classics, it's drastic
Villain the hydrochloric acid, splashed it
Pull the Nine, reached then he blasted, POW
Ten stripes on a basket
New York style wild
Cheddar grab easy
It's only entertainment though, when thought out completely
Sad demeanor, could get him the drop and bag cleaner
Master schemer
Expert in that arena
Puffin' Pasadena
You read the grass was greener
Black beamer
I8 she gyrate
Rubbing shoulders of pigs who don't fly straight
Just ate, causing indigestion
Will soon regurgitate, into profits, no question
Nosy agent sniffing around, pay attention
You can take that to the bank
"Thanks", don't mention
Pleasure's all mine, ain't mad at y'all
Clear advantage like playing paddle ball on adderall
Be brief, that is all
Aight, one more rhyme
Self-snitching rappers who's lines is pure pork rinds

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]
Ayo
It's after midnight, rocking Midnight Studios
Fuck her raw, got my wrist right
Brick white Patek spray jager put the reggie one ice, nice
Price on your baby mama head, no lice, Christ
Chuck Taylor on the Gucci knit
Out the Carrera shooting two Uzi's on some movie shit
Who he hit?
Word to [?]
You'd rather have butterflies and two are locked up
A nigga bagged the whole Ramadan
He fucked with the mosque up
Thirty days, Worthy praise
With the sleep-late, got a early grave on me
Met my plug twice, but I get them shits every time
Met Gala, I rock a heavy shine
Mind's gone collecting Hebrus
He on the cap reading Hebrews
I'm in my cell eating seafood
Big H on the Hermes dishes
Pistol whipped the nigga, left his whole head twisted
Bitch, this the finest grape, life is great
If they kick down the door, hit the fire escape, wait
You done heard dope before
But this that new batch
With one time I'm getting four more
Copped me a new MAC
