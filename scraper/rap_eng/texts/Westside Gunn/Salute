[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Got McQueen rollin' in his grave [uh] , Robert Keller straps on the K's [uh]
T By tee by Alexander Wang, niggas gettin' dap off of cocaine
Two dollars for the Christians, creases in my tans for my visits
S.E. Gang, we the wicked, we gon' get rich if it's delicious
Blowin' $300 just on commissary, step on Giuseppes get your momma buried
Rose gold rosaries, Hail Mary
Three hots & the cot, I was cell sharin'
Messhall talk gettin' dope numbers
Me and Sos plottin' on a whole summer
When Cam was locked up I was road runnin'
High points for 400, let me hold something
