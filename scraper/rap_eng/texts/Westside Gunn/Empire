[Intro: Conway]
Yuhh
I'm that nigga fa'real though, nigga
Mmhmm

[Verse 1: Conway]
Look
My shooter stay with his Roscoe
Drinkin the culture cypher, little powder 'round his nostrils
I'm OG like Rodney Little
If it's a problem wit'chu, I promise I gotta pop the pistol
You not official / 350s I rock, I got for a nickel
Youse a fake nigga, I'm opposite you
From the most dangerous city in the Empire State
Annihilate who violate
My snow / Sniff the blow, I tell her "Clean the entire plate"
This for them niggas locked behind wires and iron gates, til they dyin' date
I'm a giant, you a snake
I'm Kobe Bryant late
In the 4th / Cross you, step back, fire in ya face
Flyin in the Wraith / My bitch is Sanaa Lathan in the face
Body like Maliah, with Mariah's cake
The Skydweller with the diamond face
I ain't get this shit from supplyin' weight, I got it from rhymin' great
These niggas dancin' / My shit got real niggas chantin'
You 'posed to be a boss, you on Twitter rantin'
I don't give these niggas chances / I'm still a champion
It was written in the pamphlet, I'm as brilliant as Andy Warhol, with a empty canvas Respect ain't negotiatiated, it's demanded
Ya head is where the shit outta the pistol landed

[Conway]
Nigga
This what I do, nigga
Conway the machine, SE G, fuck nigga

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]
I be the greatest / Rockin' Karl Lagerfeld latest
Get a key, make it another key / This shit amazing
Most of the judges racist
Trying to give me 15, 23 in 1 cages /Fieg Asics
Audi A9 lookin' like a spaceship
Fiends flag it down for a base hit
A hundred plates, my runner like to lick the rezzy off
Usin' both hands when I let the dessi off
Put the barrel in ya mouth, burn a hole in ya jaw
You know who we are, where crime dont matter
My man worth a mil, we started off as a bagger
Matte black Jaguar
Allahu Akbar, star
The chopper like I work for Al Qaeda
Mess hall, used to tell tales with the lifers
Don't sit at this table, we'll knife ya
