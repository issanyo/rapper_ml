[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Your dope ain't been shit since '96
The highest and the flyest nigga
With Supreme stickers on the double cup
Took a sip, made a wish, up and wish
Diamond Supply drenched chest wide
Beat him with a skateboard
Tiffany SB's, I had to skate off
Off-White fatigue shorts
'Bout to moonwalk over this work
Bulldog, pitbull, rottweiler on the t-shirt
I'm from the worst city on Earth, bodies over bodies
Niggas thought I was broke, I copped the Maserati
Fuckin' model after model, drinkin' Louis out the bottle
He tried to see me, I took the nigga's eye out like Giotto
Lucky if you see tomorrow
My young bitch like to mix molly up in the Moscato
My young boy got five bodies, he lookin' for a sixth
Then I heard son got hit
Gettin' dutches out of King City fuckin' with Omar
Playin' Reject had to twist me a whole jaw
I don't play games, heart colder than Olaf
We don't fight fair, I beat his ass with a crowbar
Made a blind nigga see who fuckin' with me
The Flygod, you ain't fuckin' with me though
Only scared of being broke in the RICO

[Verse 2: Mach Hommy]
Yo, ayo
We like Kaiser Permanente
She tossin' Caesar's salad in Caesar's Palace for rent day
She put a lot of mileage on her french braids
I dropped to a caesar
Wikipedia shopped, bonita
Irish Spring, suckin' my ting, she sippin' Guinness
I got them world record strings in my tennis
Used to be a good chap
Ol' chum, you feeling finished?
Then swan dive in a shark tank with niggas
The black chicaroni in a Westwood, flex good
Bitched that my writer on 5th, kid finessed, jugged
Fresh pants on the poor God
For sure five, I need the whole thing lit, my team is of warlords
Caught you sippin' flat Ros√©, but did you bust it up?
Bet you never seen a PJ rage, you buttercup
Fabuloso on the stovetop, so bop
It's a new era [BRRING], it's the old Mach

[SCRATCHES: DJ Q-Bert]
Fuck rap, I'm tryin' to make cream and that's that
