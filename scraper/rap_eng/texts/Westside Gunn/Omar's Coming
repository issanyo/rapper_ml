[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, one for my niggas doing 10 years or better
RLX polo with the Ski Men on the sweater
Berlinetta pulled up, them niggas start scatterin'
Shootouts at Barney's blew the head off the mannequin
Teacher said I wouldn't be shit, now I'm the shit
Ten chains in math class, dreamin' of a brick
Thirty-six ounces back-to-back for a Range Rov'
Change the coupe's color like we change clothes
Shot his ass in front of Tony Roma's
His brains landed on the top of Barclay's, he gave me too much soda

[Verse 2: Conway]
Niggas act like I owe y'all somethin'
I come through, niggas throw the bag out the window like Omar comin'
I'll show you what this gun and the beam for
Smokin' gas on Fairfax, threw the roach in front of Supreme store
The Yeezy 2 Red Ocs', no leg shots
I cooked a brick up at Dred's spot, playin' Red Tops
Sour diesel from Santa Fe, hammer spray, banana K
The animals blammin' at where your nana stay

[Verse 3: Roc Marciano]
O.G. kush, I get your O.G. booked, Rollie took, homie look
Niggas quote me like the Holy Book
Bitches blow me while the cheese and macaroni cook
Spray the MAC and blow your shit back half a foot
My kicks will rack a foot, rubber duck bill, platypus
Eel and halibut, Swahili and Arabic
Frozen arrowhead over the pharaoh's head
Throwin' harrows, it's a narrow ledge
Niggas fill your marrow up with hollow heads
