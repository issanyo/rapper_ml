[Intro]
Ayo, grr, grr, grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!
Ayo (Boom boom boom boom)

[Verse]
Balenciagas got 42 on ‘em like Jackie Robinson
Pulled up (Skr), baddest bitch you ever seen hopping in
City of Good Neighbors, coke pots, smoking jaws
Dropped in for [?], passed them niggas on the way up (Ah)
Every nigga got a Judas, I had two of ‘em
He fell back from that lick, I should’ve knew something
True story, fed this nigga, but when the Feds came, nigga
Fuck that nigga, lord
Politicking, we counting bicken, wifey in the kitchen bitching
Residue in the Versace dishes, ain’t no fucking competition
My nigga ain’t even home
He talking digits, wipe the digits off the .40
Fly nigga since a shorty
You heard who killed who, nigga? Long story
