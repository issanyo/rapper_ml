Luxurious
Ayo
The starter knicks, Pat Ewing kicks
40 off em
Throwing up Faleek Chao, while y’all
N*ggas starvin
Bell stacked joggers, marvelous a monster
Came right in your face the rover sport duck sauces
B.I. Had me nauseous, fill the brick truck
Lou flip flops and try u that New Orleans
Fiends giving they veins torture, New Yorker
Gave work dolce and Gabana had corners
Bull strap mask and red and black foams
Camouflage Dior homme my style alone
Is exquisite, jail sand in britches fam listen
Expand chickens baking sodas grams ya can’t miss em
Quarter million gram turismo whip delicious
Stick tucked purple laces spendin yay dealers
Authentic Indian head polo, vintage
Dudda man hang you from the third floor lenox
Break down squares in fractions
Hanging on the the drop head juggling Mac-10s on glass rims
Drinking codeines for the pain
Shoot yo block up for the fame, Louis low tops showing no laces
And I just realized I’m the fuckin greatest
Clap a n*gga for the love of it
Piss on ya moms for the fuck of it
If you don’t fuck wit me n*gga fuck you then

(If you don’t fuck wit me n*gga fuck you then)
