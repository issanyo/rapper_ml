[Intro]
(Libertad! Libertad! Libertad! Libertad!)
Manolo: REHBENGAAAA
(Libertad! Libertad! Libertad! Libertad!)
Tony: Rehbenga! From a friend you fucked

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
This the Fashion Week murderer
Face in a Raf Simons mask, chain burglar
Roll you in a Persian rug
Victim of the ghetto
Mess hall, make sure u put the razor in his jello
Ringside, watching Canelo
Clip hangin' from the Heckler, went to plug yo
Me and hector, pour out the nectar
For all my niggas under pressure
Doin like 20 bullets or better
I'm talkin' 20 chains on the Moschino sweater

[Verse 2: Conway]
Look look
Leave a nigga layin' in the street
Broad day, fuck who outside, fuck whoever see
SE, let them hammers bang
AKs, bananas hang
Pull up on ya sprayin' on that corner where y'all stand and hang
Homie, you can't just approach me
Me and my brother brought the toughness to New York
Mason and Oakley
Snipe you through ya momma window, paint the upholstery
I'm that nigga, ok? Listen closely (you hear me?)
My homie upstate rockin' a rosary
15 for an attempt
Somehow the nigga he shot lived, the nigga went and snitched
That's how these fake niggas is movin'
But it's greatness I'm pursuin' with this gangsta shit I'm spewin'
Griselda Records
Get out the way, nigga/ We movin'
We goin' to MTV Awards and takin' niggas' Cubans
I'm only rockin Fashion Rebels shit
My bitch in couture fashion-level shit/ I'm the shit

[Hook: Westside Gunn]
Ayo
Amy Winter, call me later
So many SBs, you thought I was a skater
Hit 'em with the banger like Rebenga
Try to lock the yayo with a hanger
Amy Winter, call me later
So many SBs, you thought I was a skater
Hit 'em with the banger like Rebenga
Try to lock the yayo with a hanger
