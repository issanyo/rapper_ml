[Intro: Sample + Westside Gunn]
The devil wants to keep you and I deaf and dumb
He does want us to hear a word from God
Because if you hear a word from God, and it is God
You can cause havoc upon this earth
Ayo, brrt, brrt
Ayo, brrt, brrt, brrt
Brrt

[Verse 1]
Ayo, decorated in rose, playin' the stove
My shooter just copped a new nose
I copped the new Rolls
The .50 cal two-toned
Crashed into a black Tesla
Copped the [?] blue jawn
Registry duPont
Patek, no screw off
This shit nothin' new, God
Mess talks, blue orange
He got his head blew off
Air holes cool off
My shooter pulled the MAC out, it's big, take your jewels off
[?] in my new loft
These new niggas too soft
Respected by the greatest to the lil' niggas
You lucky I don't kill you niggas
Walked over water
Still spendin' brick money on my daughters
Still spendin' brick money on my-
Ah

[Outro: Sample]
Like block after block after block of kids were lined up
Mostly girls
And then they come down to this basement and
Like, maybe 30 came in at a time and then you get your thing signed and you go out
And then this wave started happening, where
You can see like, like, this woman
Maybe she's like 5 feet, and she's hyperventilating
'Cause she can see him and she's about to come get her autograph
And then, and she passed out when she got there
She says, "Hey", and then she's out
And then every woman after that passed out
And he had 2 guys who were catching them to take them outside and sit 'em against the wall
And after that, it was just like a wave
It was like when, y'know, somebody sneezes then everybody sneezes, or whatever
But it was the most bizarre thing, y'know
Like, what does it feel like to be him?
