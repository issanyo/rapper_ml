[Verse]
Ayo, Dave O'Connor's son shooting out the Porsche roof
Praying five times a day, I got court soon
Randy on the porch with his dope spoon
Louis slippers, Louis robes on my mistress
Gold 40 cal with the wiped off digits
Neck full of riches, watch Ulysses
Mulsane, guts suede, how could you miss us
All my niggas ducking, made the Dior trenches?
Ask who fucking with me and get crickets
It's Mr. Everything, chicken and rice
Rocking heavy bling, you see the difference
