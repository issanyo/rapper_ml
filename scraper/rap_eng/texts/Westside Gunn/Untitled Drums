[Intro: Conway]
Live from motherfuckin’ East Side Buffalo, New York, nigga
Hahahaha, fuckin’ Machine, bitch
Yeah

[Verse: Conway]
What’s poppin’, my nigga, it’s Conway
I promise it’s ‘bout to get realer for niggas
Y’all probably not even killers, but
Rap about it in all of your lyrics, this shit is weak
They tellin’ me I’m the illest, I ain’t even hit my peak (Ha)
The hood know I’m official, a pistol in my reach
The grimiest of all time is me, officially (That’s a fact, homie)
I done got in this bitch and made history
And proved beyond a reasonable doubt, nobody sick as me
They probably sick of me, I’ve been killing’ shit consistently
I don’t give ‘em a chance to drop nothing, I’m hot, fuck it (Hahaha)
It’s my time right now, you gotta watch, fucker (Ha)
Just sit back and hate on me, and run your cocksucker (Pussy)
‘Cause that’s all you can do
‘Cause nobody can’t fuck with the bars that I spew (Not at all)
MAC-11, let it rain, homie (Brr)
It’s the motherfuckin’ Machine, homie

[Part Three]

[Intro: Conway]
Uh huh, yeah, look

[Verse: Conway]
Crack a cigar, put a safe in it (Smokin’)
Ransack your momma house, it’s just a safe in it
G-ride in the hood, listen to Blakk Tape in it (Uh huh)
Fifth on me, clap a nigga in his face with it
Uh, closet full of BAPE shit
Supreme fiend, Just Don with the snake brim (Uh)
Fifteen hundred for my jeans
AR-15 is gunnin’ at your spleen (Brr)
Yo, what the fuck you niggas mean?
How you think that you could fuck with the Machine?
HK with the green beam and the silencer (Ah)
Two to the helmet, close range, that’ll silence him (Doot doot doot)
I might have to straight slap the shit out of a
Rap nigga to show niggas ain’t nobody wild as us (Ah)
They sayin’ we the hardest since ’96 (Uh huh)
Get out of pocket, you gon’ die quick (Yeah, Machine)

[Part Four]

[Intro: Conway]
Shit, the fuck is that shit we smokin’?
Blueberry, hit that, that shit gas
Shit, ah, damn, uh
Alright, lemme get back, look
This guy is a machine

[Verse: Conway]
I leave you dead where you stand And walk through your hood with your head in my hands (Hahahaha)
Uh, fair colored tan (Uh)
Free my niggas doin’ 20 in the feds for the yams (Free the homies)
Yeah, put the potato on the barrel (Okay)
Told you stay in your lane or I’ma air you
I know you got family but I ain’t tryna hear you
One shot, bullet went clear through
Uh, niggas violatin’ then gotta go (Uh huh)
Papi throw my bricks, I tell ‘em adios
Give it the hood and then I gotta ghost
Two niggas owe me money, fuck it, shot ‘em both (Ha)
Every nigga with me, bet they got a body
So if you think it’s a game, go ‘head, nigga, try me (Go ‘head, nigga)
Put you on the news, nigga
They found out body with your fuckin’ head removed, nigga

[Part Five]

Alright everyone

Exclusively on pay-per-view television, folks

This is the ultimate in team competition, and so much so
I strongly suggest you pick up the blower right now
Get on the phone and contact your local cable company
Avoid busy operators at the eleventh hour
Now then

[Skit: Westside Gunn & Interviewer]

You know what I’m sayin’?
‘Cause that’s just me, you know what I’m sayin’?
I like it, it’s like-
It’s whatever
Fly, hood, gangster, slick talk shit

[Part Six]

[Intro: Westside Gunn]
Brr, boom boom boom boom boom boom

[Verse: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, cocaine pots lookin’ like Basquiats
On a triple deck yacht coppin’ blocks
Had the orange stripes on the 350s, get with me
Hangin’ out the A, shot the nigga like he Ricky (Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom)
.45 in the classic Guess with the triangle
Coke spot wrapped around the corner like Rayful’s
Took the 7 out, had the baking soda take over
Helmut jaws laid in the pot, let the stove up
Dope money make the world go ‘round
King of my city from down the way to uptown
Ds find your body with a bullet in your throat
In all black, Medusa head on the Loss, y’all niggas broke
Fuck around, a three pound might hit ya (Boom)
My man came home violated in December
See you two years from now
Picture commissary, I’ma hold you down
Heard my nigga Ike about to touch ya
We used to run the yard, you’re times up
7:30 on the Joe Paul

Huh, this rap shit a free throw (Easy, nigga)
