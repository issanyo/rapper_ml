[Verse 1: Chase]
I wore the Balmain sweats for like three weeks straight
Dry clean 'em three times just for church and Wednesdays
In a meetin' where they tax you a few grand if you come late
I got some friends with pendin' cases, they might come home late
I use Picasso hues just to paint my view
If you ain't my crew don't drink my Veuve
Pop your top, leave you spillin' over
Countin' money 'til it's MillaNova
Tryin' to lose count and be a million over
Immigrant chauffeur drive me to my destination
While I sit on Gucci sofas while I try on Gucci loafers
For them Tom Ford era, Moncler wearer
A terror in Carrera, had the green Panamera
Comin' through your city like the Pan Am Express, no Panda Express
I'm out in LA eatin' Lunasia
$60 a plate, I could've cooked it myself
Give me off white for life, I'll shoot the look-book myself
I rocked Raf for a year straight, you was a year late
My mind is a clear safe, read all about it
Tweet my Louboutins
This flow is like crystal beach in Jeff Koons' fountain

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]
Ayo
In the studio, rockin' Acne Studio
You fuck niggas just study yo
Hello, hello
Oyster [?] from head to toe
Fly since a little nigga
Feel like the devil tryin' to steal a nigga
Missin' styles from Thom Browne
No white sauce on my Halal
You niggas outta style
My nigga shot himself when he went to trial (boom!)
I'm from a city where your man do you greasy for bag
Extra large on my Rag tags
Saran wrap the pack, new McLaren, newer MAC
Dummy bricks'll get your momma wacked
Face in the stuff, [?] stocking cap

[Chorus: Westside Gunn]
I dye my cocaine black
See all these killers 'round me, lot of drug dealin' 'round me
I dye my cocaine black
See all these killers 'round me, lot of drug dealin' 'round me
I dye my cocaine black
See all these killers 'round me, lot of drug dealin' 'round me
I dye my cocaine black
See all these killers 'round me, lot of drug dealin' 'round me
Hello, hello
