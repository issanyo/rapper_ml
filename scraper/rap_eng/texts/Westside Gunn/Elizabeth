[Intro: Westside Gunn]
Brr

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, I know some niggas only skate on Supreme shit
I know some niggas hit the dope with the remix
I know some niggas got two bodies and still a teenager
I know fiends that wanna lick the resi off the razor
I know niggas from uptown and down the way
I know niggas got 8 balls of pure yay
I know niggas that'll rob your ass bare faced
I know niggas that's coming home, they wanna play
I know niggas that'll sniff a line and shoot up shit (brr)
I know some niggas went upstate and got cut quick
I know niggas that'll put money on your head
I know niggas that when they hit the powder then they dead (boom boom boom boom boom boom)
I know niggas showing fake love (ah)
I know some niggas going 'round claiming fake Blood (ah)
I know some niggas going 'round claiming fake Cuz

[Chorus: Westside Gunn]
Can't nobody fuck with me
I'm that one
Keep the MAC 10 for that fuckery (brr)
Get you some
Wish Chine Gun could see me now (ah)
Wish Bacon could see me now (ah)
Can't nobody fuck with me
I'm that one
Keep the MAC 10 for that fuckery (brr)
Get you some
Wish Chine Gun could see me now
Wish Sly Green could see me now

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, every colour Lambo truck we parading
OG just came home from being caged in
Don't know what to do, been locked up since Reagan
The Lord got a better plan for you, be patient
Ma Dukes struggling, know I can't have that
Balenciaga, triple soul sitting on the dad hat
Catch me in the bushes, cone head, ski mask black (ah)
Pootie need a new pair of Guccis, where the stash at?
Day dreaming in my cell
Fredo had a body, did that nigga go to hell?
Killed another 30 with the sand on the scale (ah)
Loading up the .30, shoot the niggas over there (boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom)
Free my nigga DC, free my niggas
They gave his ass 33

[Chorus: Westside Gunn]
Can't nobody fuck with me
I'm that one
Keep the MAC 10 for that fuckery (brr)
Get you some
Wish Chine Gun could see me now (ah)
Wish Bacon could see me now (ah)
Can't nobody fuck with me
I'm that one
Keep the MAC 10 for that fuckery (brr)
Get you some
Wish Chine Gun could see me now
Wish Sly Green could see me now

[Outro: Mick Foley]
Smile, and I look at you, Benoit, as I stand here face to face
And you know what I see?
I see one of the damn best wrestlers I've ever seen in my entire life
But there's some things, Chris Benoit, that I do not see when I look in those dead eyes
I do not see an ounce of remorse
I do not see compassion
And I sure as hell don't see a sense of humour
So, Chris Benoit, I think I speak for everybody when I ask this one simple question
Why? Why, Chris? Why?
