[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Four-door [?] back-to-back
Sellin' kilos back-to-back
New hundreds growin' on trees
Seein' fiends with Cartiers
Rockin' David Robinson's, hoppin' trains
Used to trade Michael Jordan Upper Decks
Now I'm wavin' Tecs out the Lex
[?] Ferragamo water proof for rainy days
Jewelry on me like the Rakim days
Clap your work like Eric B
Ain't no worse than me but I'm on my own weight
What the fuck you did for me?
I make my own plate, gave shit to my loyals
It wasn't fish, it was oil
Let me count a half a mil
Spend it on a watch
Watch and see the great
Put a hole in your fuckin' face
