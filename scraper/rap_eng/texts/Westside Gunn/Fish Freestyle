Invasion
Brrrt
(Green Lantern)

[Verse]
Ayo
Me and Green in the [?] Lamborghin'
Too many chains on I can barely breathe
One brick, two brick, three brick, four
Bagging all night till my fingers-
Flygod!
Ayo
Me and Green in the [?] Lamborghin'
Too many chains on -
Ayo
Me and Green in the [?] Lamborghin'
Too many chains on I can barely breathe
One brick, two brick, three brick, four
Bagging all night till my fingers got sore
Dior
Denim got a P30 in 'em
3 for 25s, I'mma kill 'em all winter
I'm the God of this shit, Rakim all over
You're barely getting by 'cause your coke filled with soda
Spitting on [?], me, Irie, and Sosa
When I get out, I'mma get a Bentley with a chauffeur
Hit me up in the last month, [?] got shot
[?] got shot, Q got shot, [?] got shot
Bentley go home, Central Park too hot
[?] of bacon, ride around in new drops
Yo, filets washed down by the Ros√©s
We outta get no way
He had to snitch, he got knocked with the whole thing
He singing like Maxwell
Ike in the yard like [?]
(What up, Green)

[Outro]
Ayo, it's the Griselda invasion
These niggas can't keep up, Green
The almighty
The legendary
GxFR
We the problem right now, man, we raised the fucking bar
Griselda
