[Verse]
Can't sleep 'cause the fiends baking
Buck fifty left his cheek hanging
Yeah, I got the best dope on the strip
Hit his ass with the banana clip
I'm the god, you false prophets getting soft
Dropped the jaw, watch the fishscale dissolve
So many ships sailed [?]
Cooked him with the mask on
Pierre gloves 'cause it's raw
Uncle sniffing coke out a straw
"You ever gonna stop?" He said "naw"
Selling all these bricks, we gon' ball
I might jump in the crowd, can't vlog, naw
My young bitch ass fat, she got perfect titties
Everytime I fuck she say, "you tryna kill me?"
Hit his ass with the dummy, got 40 bands
Then shot up his block out Cory's van

[Hook]
This is for my niggas playing stoves, getting money
This is for my niggas playing stoves, getting money
This is for my niggas playing stoves, getting money
This is for my niggas playing stoves, getting money
This is for my niggas playing stoves, getting money
This is for my niggas playing stoves, getting money

[Outro: Ric Flair]
So don't be bring home one of those Mickey Mouse watches
And trying to impress the world
They like jet airplanes
Wooh
They like long limousines
They like fine clothes
They like lovely ladies
And in Studio 54, we can go
Wooh
I told 'em all [?]
You're safe
(Yo, Green)
