[Intro]
Griselda
Come here, bitch
Let me change your life
Ayo

[Verse]
Ayo, Tory Burch for my main bitch
You looking like a child's playtable for two, we never wait
Back in '98, she wore Donna
I had the Nautica [?]
First bitch to suck my dick with no hands
Yo, hit the store and get my baking soda
My first stove in the mausoleum got you [?] in the grey [?]
You smack box, Lizzy [?]
Caught that bitch with a lefty, she ain't know you had the [?] on
You fashion weak freak, you wanna fuck me at the rap show
June Jay slay my ex-bitch call me Azos
You the one for me (You my bitch)
Look you in your eyes while you sucking me
It's written all over your face
We're on our third bottle of Ace
Look at me
This dick got you hooked to me
Tat "Flygod" on your pussy, please

[Outro: Narration]
Hello?
Bitch, where you at?
You need to have my motherfucking money, bitch, when I get there, you hear me?
Huh?
You bet - I know I'm your motherfucking pimp, bitch
I'm on my motherfucking way right now, bitch, you better be there when I get there
I want my money, bitch
Who in the fuck you talking to?
I can - God damn it
You already there?
Bitch I'm on my way
Bye, ho, bye
