[Scratches: Daringer]
If it's beef, listen
I will blam you
Griselda

[Verse: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, the pack whipper, gold plastic wrap zipper
The MAC gripper, the two-for-five crack pitcher
The Ronnie Fieg rocker, the Off-White biker over the chopper
This is 23 in one lock up
Paint the Wraith Bape Camo, hang out the sunroof like Rambo
Cheese, eggs and grits outta Pano's
Virgil, Vandal, Van Gogh, I lust for bank rolls
Bitches be rubbin' my feet while you chase hoes
I was ahead of my time, baking soda, wrappin' yola
Treach on the one and two, I copped the Rover
Some niggas wanna hate 'cause I'm greater
Sent my son to hang on the calls, Bulgari down three days later
A half a milli in jewels, I had the 40 on me
Try if you want, I'll spill your brains on your trophy
[Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo]
Try if you want, I'll spray your brains on 'em

[Scratches: Daringer]
Niggas can't fuck with S.E
Remember that

[Interlude]
Listen, I'm on my J.O.B
In the hood, a live boy I'ma bang my heat
And I've never been the nigga to pause
If there's beef, fuck 'em, I hit his block
And I'm tossin' 'em all
Alot of niggas talkin' big like they gangsta and such
And the hollows won't flip that truck
Faggot, listen, I will blam you
Murder Block One is what what it is
[Inaudible]
