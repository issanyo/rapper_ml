[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, I was in my cell, I clicked my heels 3 times
P Just 2s, my khaki suit mastermind
Water whip, tossed the coke in the alkaline
Platinum and gold, rock English hat to the side
Immaculate rhyme (immaculate rhyme)
It's so obvious
Watchin' the world from up top
Snakeskin binoculars
Red companions
Corset is on a suede mansion
My bedroom had a bedroom, my wrist be dancin' (my wrist be dancin')
My bedroom had a bedroom, my wrist be dancin'
The flyest that's livin', we live and die by the kitchen
Choppin' on dishes, rack the puff in, ambition
Bitch we had hopped over fences
Banana yellow Fiskers (skrt)
Pushin' crack like we invented it
Jeff Koons, Louie Rubens duffle got ten in it (got ten in it)
Kobe Jordan, pack we was  kickin' it (we was kickin' it)
Anti Social Social Club wit' the snub, yo (boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom)
Gave the Tec a lil' love bro (drrrrr)
Grand wizard, Patek band, lizard, hand-kissin'
Miami Beach, geigers on Biscayne (Biscayne)
My shooter seen his PO in [?] ([?])
Thank god for my wrist game (wrist game)
Countin' money in the bubble bath
Whip the half and got another half (whip)
Rockin' Vetements, backhand you with the 40
Ask Lord, your head'll spin, a cold war Leatherman
You will never be better than Sean [?]
(Du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du)
Pulled up, red GL on devilish (skrt)
Word to the goggles on my Hebru Brantley
Red Supreme Louie gloves, eatin' scampi (ah)
Supreme Louie box logo wit' the .44 (boom boom boom)
The way we sellin squares you'd swear them shits is bogo
(Shits is bogo, shits is bogo)
You'd swear them shits was fucking bogo

[Verse 2: DOOM]
Jumping to a conclusion, could stunt your evolution
Like the trees, dumped into some dust, blunt fusion
Old cocktail of mine, chemicals derail time
It's all good, as long's he ain't inhaling swine
Dare decline, scared money makes none
Take one, you should've flushed before the jakes come
Oh shart, specialty is flow art
Smart, but go in circles like a go-kart
Yeah, don't start, make 'em have to finish
Just bounce like gold-diggers
Once the dough diminish
Phony, it gets lonely at the finish (yup)
You see some deal dope, others steal hope
What's revealed is of a certain feel - grope
Yellow moist mushie, banana peeled coke
At worst, could not be confused with real soap
Nope, you see disaster is intended
In the face of truth, don't ever be offended
Overstand the past to get a grasp of the present (psst)
I make it faster than you spends it
End it
