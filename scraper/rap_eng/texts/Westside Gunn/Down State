[Intro: Westside Gunn]
Ayo
Ayo

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn & Conway]
Nicer than anybody you say the nicest
Nigga heard the 30 years and turned righteous
Sly doing four lives where niggas knifing
Ever since FLYGOD, these niggas biting
Drug deals got me on the heels
Baking, bagging up, watching pistols shoot steel
Close your mouth, you know the deal
You know the real, youngin' in Atlanta
Made a quarter mil', posted on Del
Me and West back and forth still sharp as steel
My nigga growing grey hairs, he lost his third appeal
Graduated to 100 bricks, he was a dropout
Gianni, majors in silk, I'm eating chophouse

[Break: Styles P]
From Buffalo to YO
Ride out

[Verse 2: Styles P]
If it's gangster, just consider him
Cross, empty shot, from the laces to the fitted brim
It's across the border, we can get it in
Don't make the deal if he shaking and jittering
Shoot him, pick up all of the cases, we ain't littering
Grass, cause it's snakes in the grass, and they slithering
Fangs and the venom, you can see the whip in a fit
But this nigga still bang in his denim
I know a couple goons got some change that I sent 'em
Made my bones all alone, holding chrome
Saying poems in the zone
Where they pop you in the dome and watch your mouth foam
And get the plug number out your phone
And next is invasion in your home
You know this (yeah)
Do as Romans when in Rome
But I'm Hannibal from Carthage
And I like cartilage
So you ain't gonna make it on your own
What nigga!

[Break: Benny]
Ayo, it's the Butcher
Lemme get some

[Verse 3: Benny]
Yo, uh, I've been around twice, I'm stamped in several places
But never take us, that's the way that this ghetto made us
Pay me bills with the face up, stretched it, I went base up
Back when all these rap niggas was rocking them yellow Jacob's
We was on missions that ain't sound safe
We did stick ups, that's how we took squares out of round safes
My dog caught a lick and bought a crib with the brown gate
Got knocked with the money and got his GED in down state
This how you get a plug and bounce back when it's over
Gotta hang out where they at, so first note where they going
Then you get it, hit it, when it lock, then you flip it over
Show you how to get the crib with Gucci pillows on the sofa
I done been locked in the same halls they standing in
Broke, needing a favour and I can't call my man again
Saw it before it happened, not the game I was playing in
Eight figures will make them comfortable like Raymour & Flanigan
Nigga
