[Verse 1]
Ayo Ayo Ayo
Don't ever try to fucking play me
50 shot flip that nigga crazy
[?] like that ain't my baby
I got the father where the fuck my baby
Chase his ass through down the way
They found the niggas brains somewhere on Bailey
Shooter Israeli chopped the nigga fingers off
So he can mail em'
Had the gold [?] Donatella
Life like Pesci in Goodfellas
This flygod that's my features nigga
This for my Jack Mack eating niggas
This for my twenty three and one lords
I kick in your door with the pump
[?] forty five filet well done
Your favorite rapper that's my son
Stop acting like you know me
I give the joint to my little homie
He ain't missed a nigga yet
So many dome shots he only got his ear left

Fuck y'all niggas thought man
Playing with y'all niggas
We having fun
Don't get shit fucked up
We do everything say round here my nigga
These niggas scared of us man
We don't invited to no award shows no nothing
Niggas don't even wanna fucking blog us nigga
You know why right
We in y'all niggas nightmares
Y'all like the
Y'all like to hear about it but y'all scared to see the real shit
Y'all niggas rap about it but stay in the fucking house
I don't see y'all niggas nowhere
