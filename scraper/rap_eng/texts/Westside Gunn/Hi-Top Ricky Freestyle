[Intro]
Ayo
Ayo
Brrr
Ayo
Brrrt
Fuck these niggas

[Verse]
Ayo
Scoring bones on the mastermind trench
Kick in your door hi-top Ricks (Rickys)
Shell catches on the sticks
This looks like a Lam-arrari mix
All praises due
You couldn't walk a mile in my pubes
Don't get shit confused
You bool but you ain't that bool
Cut from another cloth
Turned a double up into a brick, I'm gone
Porsche trunk got a body, I'm probably
The realest in the fucking game, keep these fuck niggas from 'round me
The flyest in the game, keep these bum bitches fuck from 'round me
(Fuck these bitches too, man
You ain't getting up on me, bitch)
I'll knock your [?] off
Ayo
Where y'all was at when I was getting raided?
[?] flushed the eight, I was devastated (Fucked my whole week up)
Momma, your baby made it
Oww, rock laters
Touched the bitch, then the bitch fainted
Rocking tiger ASICS
Half a mil in my momma basement
[?] changes (uh uh)
(You can't fuck with us)
I don't give a fuck, nigga
Shootouts with strangers

[Outro: Sample]
Hid the dope
Got a stashbox
[?]
200 on the dash
Fly by cops wouldn't like
Hid the dope
Got a stashbox
[?]
200 on the dash
Fly by cops wouldn't like
(I-i-i-invasion)
