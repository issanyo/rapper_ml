[Chorus]
Broke niggas on the block, chip in on one bag
Get caught, no lawyer money now you lookin' all so sad
My nigga didn't take the plea, then he went out bad
Nigga still got enough, 55 and a half

[Verse]
Ayo, I had the Ford GT
Makin' money, money don't make me
The four pound no safety
These bullets will ruin your life, my nigga I'm nice
Havin' visions of Sean Price, filet mignon with my fried rice
Now I'm the greatest on site
I'm as dope as it get
Smack shit out you rappers and whoever you with
XFR, yola spinnin' in the mayo jar
I'm nasty, dick sucks from Nicki and Ashley
I'm on the yacht eatin' crab meat
Keep the K on the back seat, first nigga in the Jag Jeep

[Chorus]
Broke niggas on the block, chip in on one bag
Get caught, no lawyer money now you lookin' all so sad
My nigga didn't take the plea, then he went out the back
Nigga still got enough, 55 and a half

[Outro]
Ayo
This is for all my uptown niggas
My Central Park niggas
My down the way niggas
My Fruit Belt niggas
My NOLA niggas
My Delevan niggas
My Dope Street niggas
My Westside niggas
All my Broadway, my warden niggas
To Paris, to Fairus, Lanefield, Kingfield
This for all my niggas gettin' money
For all my niggas locked up
This for my niggas that's no longer with us
This for my momma nigga
