No one on the corner has swagger like Puff
Swagger like Puff, swagger, swagger like Puff
No one on the corner has swagger like Puff
Swagger like Puff, swagger, swagger like Puff
No one on the corner has swagger like Puff
Swagger like Puff, swagger, swagger like Puff

Mr. Combs is in the building

(No one on the corner...)

Swag at a hundred, trillion, zillion
Bitch Brazilian, hair color chameleons
Skin tone vanilla, two scoops of chillin'
Ciroc Blue Ice
Anything you do, I do twice
What you do, I don't do like you
(No one on the corner...)
No one on the planet, nobody more famous, lavish or more savage
(No one on the corner...)
Who the fuck you think matters

[Verse 2: Diddy]
(No one on the corner...)
No one on the corner even close to my swag
I ain't gonna buy a boat, I bought a store on Fifth Ave
(No one on the corner...)
No one on the corner raise hell like this
Go to war with a coast and get a star for that shit
And you can learn a lot by jacking, jacking my style, jacking, jacking my style
Y'all been jacking for a while
Fresh from Argentini, bitches in bikinis
Maserati like copra Asti Martini
(No one on the corner...)
Im the king of Zamunda, mirror mirror who is on my corner
My shades too dark to see you losers
(No one on the corner...)
No one on my corner by law I'm the ruler
Go back to your jeweler tell 'em make you more cooler
Am a rich dude, baby this is big dick rules
I make dating R&B chicks cool
And I ain't got no cooth, I ain't got no roof
All I got is my word, so my swag is the truth

[Hook: Cassie]

[Diddy:]
No one on the corner got swagger like Puff
Swagger like Puff, swagger like Puff

[Verse 3: Diddy]
(No one on the corner...)
Diddy mothaf***** am a bad boy billionaire
Hundred carat pinky ring in the air
(No one on the corner...)
In that Bentley Benzema I just shift a little gear
Top speed top free topless bitches everywhere
I could drop a hundred mill like it really ain't nothing
I'm on Forbes top hundred
You on Forbes top nothing
I got houses in Miami
Mermaids up in them fishing tanks
I've been spending hundreds since Ferrari square bodies
(No one on the corner...)
Everybody pay homage to that raisin in the sun
I've been raising little sons since 98, no wait 91
(No one on the corner...)
I'm you ****** godfather
Mothaf****** why bother
When you flys I be on your clothes coming charter
On a G5 jerky looking like b five
Hotter than the sun, I be in Ibiza smoking weed
I'm higher than a mountain top
Baby put your mouth on top (come on) little lolli pop
Suck it till your hymen pops
(No one on the corner...)
****** wanna climb the charts, I'm already up there
Shit I did ten years ago is still up there
And I can't stop, all these motherfucking number ones
I'mma retire at number one
Set fire to you number ones
Baby where I'm coming from is nine hundred ninety nine millis till I'm nine hundred ninety nine billi
Who can fuck with me?
(No one on the corner)
