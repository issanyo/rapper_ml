I pray to God every night. I still do that
I just wanted, I wanted God to know that even tho I was going through the worst of times I still recognize him as being something greater than myself
And that Im not gonna give up my faith just because its going bad for me
Cause he was there when I was living good, so I just want him to know that, you know that Im not no punk, and I'm not soft hearted. That when it gets bad I'm gonna be like ohh I dont believe in God no more
I believe in God all the time, everyday, all day, good and bad, rough and hard, 5 shots, jail time, everything
Good times, million dollars, benzs, all that, I always believe in God because he gave it all to me
