(DJ Felli Fel)

Akon
Testing one, two, three!

Diddy
Testing one, two, three
Check this out, listen to me
Listen...

It's tricky, I'm picky baby, but I just spotted you
Doin your thang, G-string, shoe-string point of view
HEY - lend me ya body, you got me in a zone (c'mon)
Bet a million and a half cash, I can make you explode (OWW!!)
You don't wanna brave the cold, you want a day of Combs
I can take you on outer limits away from home
(Where your bills pile?) I'm whylin fo' sho
In a middle of the club doin a rodeo show (hey)
The hoes seem steamy, wet dreamy
Invisible sets gleamy (incredible sex) you need me
Ease me, please me baby
I may be am a little crazy, but in a way that they playa-pay me

(Chorus)
Akon (DJ Felli Fel)
(Don't make me get BUCK IN HERE!!!!!)
Shorty drop it to the ground like she ain't got manners
Too much booty for one man to handle
When all I need is a one-night scandal
(And I'ma get BUCK IN HERE!!!!!!)
DAMN, lil' mama, know you fit my standards
You're the type that make me grip that handle
Lick shots in the air, bustin that random
While you make it clap-clap-clap-clap-clap
(You gotta shake that thang, shake that thang)
While you make it clap-clap-clap-clap-clap
(Just shake that thang, shake that thang)

Ludacris
Okay...LUDA..let's go!
She can make it clap like a standin ovation!
Spin like my record at your radio station
Feel the sensation, I put it right there
They be like, "LUDA!!", I be like "He-yeaaaaah!!"
You like it like that, (WOO!) don't cha baby? (yeah)
The flow's insane, and the stroke is crazy (okay)
I stroke so good like Tiger Woods
Then I, ROWRR!!, like a tiger would
My livelihood is not Hollywood
I'm still Southside Atlanta, that's a lively hood
A circus, Big Top like Ringling Brothers
If you wanna learn somethin, (what?) bring your mother! (hey!)
Sit back and observe, invite your friends
We can mix it all up, like juice and gin
Felli on the celly with a couple of twins
Cause tonight, damn RIGHT! We gon' do it again

(Chorus)
Diddy
Aiyyo...aiyyo Felli, brotha let me hit this one more time
Listen, women lace 'em, G4 jet flyin
Twist 'em crooked, cell phone number's private (c'mon)
Flip 'em, change 'em, prissy I'm bougie, the hood
Game 'em, taste 'em, trizzies I run 'em, I'm good (OW!!)
Leather or, silk, I melt them all (talk to 'em)
Love 'em, leave 'em, give 'em hell fo' sure (don't stop)
Tell 'em words they mind and soul deserve (don't stop)
Or, give 'em, things the might prefer (keep it goin)
San Tropez or Mandarin sweet massage 'em (keep it goin)
Pimp, game 'em, grants and Benz I charge 'em
Used to style 'em, now I just Virgin Isle 'em (talk to 'em Diddy)
Karma Sutra, freaky and leavin 'em smilin

(Chorus)
Lil Jon - as music stops
Hold up, bust that shit! Fuck that shit! (Yo-yo-yo-yo)
It's yo' boy Lil Jon! (YEAH!)
Time to TAKE THIS MOTHERFUCKER TO ANOTHER LEVELLLLLL!!!

Get yo' motherfuckin hands up! - HEY! (Put 'em up! Put 'em up!)
A-get yo' motherfuckin hands up! - HEY! (Put 'em up! Put 'em up!)
