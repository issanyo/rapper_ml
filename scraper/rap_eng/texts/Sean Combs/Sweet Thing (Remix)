[Verse 1]
I will love you anyway even if you cannot stay
I think you are the one for me
Here is where you ought to be
I just want to satisfy ya
‘Cause you’re not mine and I can’t deny it
Don’t you hear me talkin’, baby?
Love me now or I’ll go crazy

[Chorus]
Whoa, sweet thing
Don’t you know you’re my everything
Whoa, sweet thing
Don’t you know you’re my everything
Yes, you are

[Verse 2]
I wish you were my lover but you act so undercover
Love you child my whole life long, be it right or be it wrong
More than what you make me, baby
Don’t walk away, don’t be so shady
Don't want your mind, don’t want your money
These words I say they may sound funny but…

[Chorus]
Whoa, sweet thing, yeah
Don’t you know you’re my everything
Whoa, sweet thing
Don’t you know you’re my everything
Yes, you are
Yes, you are, baby

[Verse 3]
You are my heat, you are my fire
You make me weak with strong desire
Love you child my whole life long
Be it right or be it wrong
I just want to satisfy ya
‘Cause you’re not mine, I can’t deny it
Don’t you hear me talkin’ baby?
Love me now or I’ll go crazy

[Outro (Repeat 4x)]
You’re my heat, you are my fire
You’re not mine, I can’t deny it
Don’t you hear me talkin’, baby?
Love me now or I’ll go crazy
