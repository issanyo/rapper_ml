[Verse 1: Student 1]
Here appearing is the urban poor man
Pouring pinot, plus I'm puffing the herb and your can
Of beer, gotta be getting a gut of residency
And I see you running for babysitting presidency
And I'm presuming my presence is neither precious or predictable
But I can promise that the prediction of me downing your drink
Is affluent in accuracy
Mr. Afework, the after-work attacker that's me!
Carry caution like the Caribou I'm dodging
I'm driving driven to dribble this
Spit spawning words off top or when I scribble diss
Quit, pause, and then select 'leave game'
You got none, you nancy nigga receive shame
At a ridiculous level, too untouchable and agile
Rap ya blah blah while I roll my eyes and think of a counter attack
Oh where your confidence go?
I'm concluding it's coming from your incompetence
Oh, my, lord
You let it get immense, you can call it my fro'
My word, why flow, you really should lie low
Hi ho, ass nigga, gimme all your hydro
Hyper, hot shit I'm heating up the silo
That I'm in, rhymin' so stinky
The timing I pinky promise is like a dime into kinky-ness
King in any province, the pro on any promenade
I'm prime in the Grove, so I'm prime in Helsinki
Hello there, shot taker here, take in the fact the wary one
Be me my brother, I never carry gun
Still do not think for a second that I'm not scary son
I'm stunning to your kin, cunning verbal I be varying
Very young, dumb, dapper, radically erratic with a radder Aesthetic my etiquettes out the door
The predicates on the floor and the subject is enemy
Channel my inner apathy like Connecticuts at my core
Connecting all of the dots, you're a star
I'm a constellation
You tempt me I'll make a comedy of ya congregation
Temper shorter than the temperature of
Pluto
Puto, piss me off, and get put in a complication
While I read your thoughts
The ones you've made, the ones you will
The wonder in your head and fantasies that I won't stun you still
Stunt like you won't lose, I'm gunning for the spot you seek
That I know you think you can get
When you tried, you got too weak
That's predicting the future, futile is the resistance
Of inevitability oh no
You never gonna be pro brooo
I'm better, you better be peacing
You get it or get to be pieces
Oh enemy enemy no no
They folding I got em' in creases
While increasing the intensity
Muggy, sunny, rain
I'm Minnesota reppin' with the druggy funny pain
I'm pushing to the opposer, potentially potential lacking
Looking never fresh like Doug E
Dope, do your wee little whipping like buggy
Bet I, be, living in a paradise
I'm luckier than 7
Or the sad single cigarette, 4 clover leaves
Getting foes to the floor and their whore overgrieves
While I bump Grieves
I'm dismantling, cancelling
Stay a grand man and that's with shipping and handling
Handy with the pen, you hit a half stepping bar
Hand to God, going postals a part of my repertoire
Reppin' our city, chilly night chill
Challenging to find a lighter for this really quite kill
Quite ill informed with the nonsense that you produce
My reply so fly, my conscience is Dr. Steuss
I, stay the skinny cat, in the hat is all the nappiness
Nap time for this little lippy chipper dapper dummy rapper Skippy flow flipper from the crapper
I'm a hippy whippersnapper
Moving where the boom and bappy go
I want what I want, and imma go get it
No dead it, no let it
Go, said it once and that's final
2 blunts and a vinyl, I'm zippy with the procure
And punching to your spinal
My crass ass creed never cruddy when we crippling your crew
The trolling and the trippiness is tripling for true
Focused on the evil fellow I force salt in
Hopping over y'all I'm a pro at pole vaultin'
Anti havoc haltin', eating till I'm fuller
Yet they set to wet the bed, I'm the enemy puller
Palladium shining
Sean Daley influenced and uranium rhyming
Radioactive activation verbally
Vernacular tumorous, ya heard of me
And now you're turning terminal
Can't terminate or murder me
So just turn up to the fly mon rage
And carry me past the crowd if I die on stage
