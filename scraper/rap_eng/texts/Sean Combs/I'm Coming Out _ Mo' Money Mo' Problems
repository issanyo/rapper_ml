You gotta let it show
I'm coming, I'm coming
(Alright, alright) Out
I'm coming, I'm coming out
I'm coming

Yo, I'm coming out
Like the sun after rain
Ready to shine
No time to be playin'
Feeling good, gonna get get
What I want, gonna show
Erry, erry, errybody how I front
Look at me now
How my confidence is soaring
Dudes be impressed
With the points I'm scoring like
(That ain't boring)
And it just don't quit
Watch the kid drop his jaws
When I'm shaking my hips

She's coming out (She's coming)
It's time to take a stand
Show the world that I'm coming out
(That she's coming out)
