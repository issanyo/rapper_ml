[Intro]
Then you get another chance tomorrow, I don't hustle like that. I hustle like this. There's not a second left. You know there's tomorrow, I'm hustlin' like there's only one more second left of this hustle

Don't, don't be comin' over here with shit when I'm (workin')
Call me Mr Combs, and I'm 9 digit strong
Niggas hating on me but it's not (workin')
When I was 19, I walked in the house
And I told my momma she could stop (workin')
When you niggas used to beatbox on the block
Big and D-Rock, they was gettin' that (work in)
Then I linked up with some niggas from my hood
Who was know for puttin' that (work in)
And if your record ain't have it (like that, like that)
Nah, then your song, then your song wasn't (workin')
Ran into this young jawn, tell her come home
She asked for a check I said, "Bitch is you (workin')
Now everytime she call I don't even pick up
I just hit her with the text like

[Verse 2]
I do this shit for B.I.G
So if you don't like me fuck you and the building, you (workin')
If you see us in the club with CÃ®roc by the tub
We ain't had fun, nigga we (workin')
In the DJ booth like an independent group like
"Look, this a record we (workin')"
Play this shit a hundred times
If you don't we gon' be in here every single night that you (workin')
Shout out to my people with a job
I hope you don't fall asleep tomorrow when you (workin')
I was mackin' on this chick, my partner tapped me on the back
I turned around like "Nigga can't you see me, (workin')"
She a waitress or a stripper
If it's past midnight and she tell you she's (workin')
And we hustle before we can play
So even on Memorial Day, my nigga

Don't bother me, I'm workin'
Don't bother me, I'm workin'
Don't bother me, I'm workin'
Don't bother me, I'm workin'
