[Intro: Diddy and Skepta]
Yeah, Team UK, stand up
This is the grime remix
Skepta, Diddy Dirty Money (Skepta)
As we proceed (Boy Better Know)
Yeah

[Verse 1: Skepta]
The bad boys are back
Blowing up shit like bomb in Iraq
Diddy's in white, I'm in all black
It's about to get real grimey
So somebody say "DJ, pull up the track"
Ow, shut this down
Ain't heard nothing like this since "Pow!"
Ain't heard nothing like this
So god forgive me if I buss my ting right now
Wow I blow my own trumpet
And if you don't like it, lump it
I'm a UK Bad Boy, just for the record
I like tea, but I don't like crumpets
Dirty Money and Boy Better Know together
That's crazy as hell
Me and Diddy got both hands on the big red button
Just say the word we shut down the world

[Hook: Diddy & Skepta]
This is the grime remix, lets got
Ayo Skepta, lemme get on some of this instrumental man
I walk into the club and I got two sexy girls on each side
Money in the bank but still I gotta stay on my grind
Man better mention me when they talk about grime
And they told me to shut this down I'mma do it tonight
I'mma do it tonight

[Verse 1: Skepta &  Diddy]
I'm Skepta, I'm that guy
And I'm D-I-D-D-Y
Boy Better Know till I die
And you can't see me, I'm way too fly
Chicks stop and stare when I go by
Niggas hate me and I don't know why
Cause I've spent half my life in the sky
And I buy the things that you wanna buy
Yeah, take that, c'mon don't stop
Talk to them girl

[Verse 2: Dawn Richard & Kaleena]
So hot gotta bring the shit, back now gotta say hello good morning
Spending dirty money everywhere go from the 5-0-4 New York to London
All you bitches can just sit back and watch how me and Puffy be on it
Like Diddy we get money, them haters acting funny
'Cause were jet setting taking all your milk and honey
You ain't never seen a bad bitch buying nothing for nout with a mouth like this
Lying down with the 2-1-5 middle stay high make it rock like this
Dirty money up in your area, bitch ass niggas ain't scared of us
Come at me no time, got you on my mind
Let just spend your money and come sit on your mind (get it)
I don't kiss and tell, but I'm gon' kiss and tell
You everything that's on my heart so you can know me well

[Bridge: Diddy]
Yeah, you are now listening to the best
You now listen to the sounfsDirty Diddy Money

[Hook: Skepta & Diddy]
I walk into the club and I got two sexy girls on each side
Money in the bank but still I gotta stay on my grind
Man better mention me when they talk about grime
And they told me to shut this down I'mma do it tonight
I'mma do it tonight

[Outro: Diddy]
Ayo Skepta
That's why we Dirty Money man, let's get it man
Team UK baby
