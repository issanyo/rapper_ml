Ashley, Melissa, Diana, Holly
Dream, Bad boy, baby, let's go

Don't know what I gotta do
To get through to you
You ain't tryin' much to hard
To get the message through

I know, 'cause I feel the same
And it's drivin' me insane
Why do we have to play these games?
Oh, no

I wish that I could get the nerve up
Walk right up to you
And ask you, baby, for your name
(Ask you, baby, for your name)

You look so inviting
(You do)
This seems so exciting
(It does)
We should be together this way
(We should be together this way)

So what's the deal?
(What's the deal?)
This don't seem real
(This don't seem real)
This kind of thing
Only happens in my dreams
(Thing only happens in my dreams)

When boy meets girl
(Oh, yeah)
A perfect world
(A perfect world)
This sort of thing
Only happens in my dreams
(This only happens in my dreams)

Top down and we're cruisin' slow
With friends that we both know
It's just a Friday night thang
And I am ready to go

Hit the club and the party's on
DJ playin' favorite song
It's just the way that we live
So let's go

Baby, in the way you're moving
(You're moving)
Ooh, you've got me thinkin'
(Thinking)
We should be together for days
(Now we should be together for days)

And as the days are slower
(Oh, yeah)
Ooh, you pull me closer
(Me closer)
Can't believe it feels this way
(Can't believe it feels this way)

So what's the deal?
(What's the deal?)
This don't seem real
(This don't seem real)
This kind of thing
Only happens in my dreams
(Thing only happens in my dream)

When boy meets girl
(Oh, yeah)
A perfect world
(A perfect world)
This sort of thing
Only happens in my dreams
(This thing only happens in my dreams, baby)

This seems so real to me
(Real too me)
But it's a fantasy
(Fantasy)
Baby, why can't you see?
(Can't you see that, baby?)

I need to know the deal
(I need to know)
There is no time to kill
(There's no time to kill)
You got to know it before I go insane

So what's the deal?
(So what's the deal?)
This don't seem real
(I gotta know)
This kind of thing
Only happens in my dreams
(This kinda thing only happens in my dreams)

When boy meets girl
(Oh, yeah)
A perfect world
(A perfect world)
This sort of thing
(This thing, this thing)
Only happens in my dreams
(Only happens in my dreams)

Tell me, baby
(Tell me, baby)
I really gotta see
(Oh, baby)
These kinda things
Only happen in my dreams

Tell me, baby
(Tell me, baby)
I really gotta see
(Oh, baby)
These kinda things
Only happen in my dreams

So what's the deal?

This don't seem real
(Gotta know it)
This kind of thing
(This thing, this thing)
Only happens In my dreams
(Only happens in my dreams)

When boy meets girl
(When boy meets girl)
A perfect world
(It'll be a perfect world)
This sort of thing
Only happens in my dreams
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)

So what's the deal?
(Tell me, baby)
This don't seem real
(Ooh, baby)
This kind of thing
Only happens in my dreams
