[Chorus: Mary J. Blige and Notorious B.I.G.]
You're all, I need
Lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fucking die together
To get by
You're all, I need
Lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fucking die together
To get by

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Shorty I'm there for you anytime you need me
For real girl, it's me in your world, believe me
Nothing make a man feel better than a woman
Queen with a crown that be down for whatever
There are few things that's forever, my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nothing
You made a brother feel like he was something
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no fronting
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say, baby it'll be okay
Now that's real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my cootie away and keep it tight aight
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a fat-ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life, you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'ma make sure we be
Living in the effin lap of luxury
I'm realizing that you didn't have to funk with me
But you did, now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige and Notorious B.I.G.]
You're all, I need
To get by
You're all, I need
Lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fucking die together
To get by

[Interlude: Mary J. Blige]
Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny
With you I'll spend my time
I'll dedicate my life, I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life to you

[Verse 2: Method Man]
I got a Love Jones for your body and your skin tone
Five minutes alone, I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got the good stuff at home
Even if I'm locked up North you in the world
Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showing your stuff off, boo
It be true me for you, that's how it is
I be your Noah, you be my Wiz
I'm your Mister, you my Misses with hugs and kisses
Valentine cards and birthday wishes, please
We on another level of planning, of understanding
The bond between man and woman, and child
The highest elevation 'cause we above
All that romance crap, just show your love

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige and Notorious B.I.G.]
You're all, I need
Lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fucking die together
To get by
You're all, I need
Lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fucking die together
To get by
