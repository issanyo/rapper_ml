FORGIVE THEM GOD
FOR THEY DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY DO
THEY DON’T KNOW, NO THEY DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY DO
DO YOU?
CAUSE I DON’T THINK YOU DO

WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
WE SURVIVED IN AMERICA
NOW WE'RE LEAVING AMERICA
JUST LIKE BIGGIE LEFT AMERICA


CAME FROM HEAVEN JUST TO SING A SONG FOR YOU
TO THE RHYTHM OF MY LOVE FOR YOU, AND NOW IT’S BEATING SLOW
AND YOU KNOW IT’S THE END OF THE ROAD
WHEN I SING THAT SLOW SONG FOR YOU
LOVE WAS NOTHIN BUT ANOTHER GUN FOR YOU
AND I WOULD HIDE IT IN MY HELPLESS SOUL
I’M NOT AFRAID TO GO DOWN THE ROAD
WHERE WE GO, I DON’T KNOW
YOU CAN HEAR EM CALLIN, DON’T YOU?
WHEN THE ANGELS CALL LIKE

IF YOU DON’T WANNA STAY YOU CAN GO
SEEMS LOVE DON’T LIVE HERE NO MORE
THE ANGELS ARE FLYING SO LOW, SINGING TO YOU
