[Intro: Puff Daddy & Rick Ross]
(Puff Daddy) Ayo, turn out all the lights in the club
Grab your bitch, nigga
We here
(Rick Ross) We talking about new money, nigga. What you know about it?
(Puff Daddy) Rozay! Turn me up real loud
I want these niggas to hear me
Bugatti Boyz. Puff Daddy. Maybach Music, this Bad Boy, bitch

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
You niggas paranoid
I party getting money
I know I’m the shit: my janitor be getting money
I got a skyscraper, it’s a hell of a view
Got me closer to God, angel wings on my coupe
Pray for me, damn I grind everyday for it
If you see me riding in it, means I paid for it
Bugatti Boyz 1.8 fours
I got money baby I could order 8 more
Fuck the Forbes list lets tell the truth I ate more
I got a billion baby time to get 8 more
12 bedrooms, time to get 8 more
Stack up all the cases of Ciroc up on the 8th floor

[Hook: Rick Ross & (Puff Daddy)]
Got a hundred million
(its time to get another one)
How this Bugatti feel
(I may need me another one)
5 bad bitches
(just got me another one)
P. Diddy run the city
(never be another one)
5 mill cash
(and I need another one)
Rocking a different Rollie
(no this not the other one)
Stacking a number getting money
(nigga number one)
Real niggas run the city
(never be another one)

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
These haters speculate
They always watching mine
She know what time it is
Just like my watch line
My clothes line
The cologne bitch
I know you smell this money sitting on this throne bitch
I’m strong bitch
I own shit
Gave myself a ten digit bonus
I’m the money man, never financed
Go get this money baby, with yo fine ass
If ya nigga broke it’s time to get another one
If you bitch is tripping time to get another one
I’m Puff Daddy bitch there’ll never be another one
Bugatti Boyz forever one

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I feelin’ the money
I’m lovin’ the paper
Nigga hate in the 'hood
Took his ho to Jamaica
If I let down the top
Let the breeze in my beard
VIP is the spot, they playing musical chairs
My Columbian the man, holla, "Beam me up shawty"
Got that money in the bag that can hold a fucking body
1.5 for this brand new black Bugatti
Jewels like I’m Slick Rick
Bally shoes ladi-dadi
I’m feeling myself, bitch you do the same
Fuck what I spend at the bar
You should see how I came
Keep my bitch at her best
With one foot in the trap
If I bust at your chest I bet that's a wrap
(take that)
