[Verse 1]
Money Makin Mitch is this fairy tale, you know
About this fly nigga from Harlem
That came up, and he did his thing man
He was shinin' on em, stylin' on em, showin' em how to do it, showin' em how to get it
Maybe he was getting it the wrong way
But you know, the fairy tale of it
Is most brothers and sisters end up dead or in jail
But check this out with this fairy tale I created in my brain
Imagine this Mitch nigga survived
Took those different talents and attributes and business skills and applied it to the world of business
Man the game, the legal game
So this is the fairy tale man
And fairy tales do come true
Cuz we got millions of cats that comin' up with that hustler spirit and drive
They got that Mitch in them
And they ain't gon fall to the wayside
They gon' take their street smarts
And run the world
Cause the black man is god
And No Way Out 2
That's how Imma leave it on you, peace

Ladies and Gentlemen, we are preparing to make our final descent into New York Motherfucking City
The local time is 11: 04 PM, and the temperature is 68 degrees
If you look to your left, you will see the borough of Brooklyn, home to the Notorious B.I.G.; and on your right is the world-famous Harlem World, home of the legendary Puff Daddy himself
For your safety and comfort, please remain seated with your seatbelt fastened until the captain turns off the fasten seatbelt sign
On behalf of the entire crew, I'd like to thank you for flying Combs Air, where all dreams do come true
