I heard you like to ball alot
And you like shoppin' at the mall alot
Braggin' to your friends about what you got
But all of that's just material
Don't really mean a thing to me
You should know that
There's more to life than what you see
Please believe it (oh oh oh)

You just don't care enough
You always think somebody's gonna buy you stuff
You never know who you might turn away
You never know where real love could be

Those type of girls don't interest me
You should know that
There's more to life than what you see
Please believe it (oh oh oh)

Chorus
How I can give you diamonds baby
I can take you 'round the world
None of that is really what you need
I just wanna give you something
You can't put a price on
And it can make you reach
Beyond you wildest dreams

Verse 2
It doesnt't matter what they lace you with
'cause all you seem to like is expensive Shh
You can't use everybody that you meet
'casue girl that's just not the way to be
Don't play that game cause you won't last
You will see that one day it's not about that
Please believe it baby

You just don't care enough
You always think somebody's gonna buy you stuff
You never know who you might turn away
You never know where real love can be
Those type of girls don't interest me
You should know that there's more to life than what you see
Please believe it (oh oh oh)

Chorus ( sing twice)

Bridge
I can give you everything baby
But don't you want more in life
Than material things from me
So please let me be, be all that you need
And take you beyond your wildest dreams

Chorus ( sing once)

( sing twice)
Listen to me cause ma-ter-ial things
Ain't what you need
Cause that ain't everything

Chorus
