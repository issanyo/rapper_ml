I'll let you know all that's on my mind
You have a little time
And I'll be sure to tell you everything
I've been holding in for so long

Everyday thinking 'bout your face
I can't wait to tell you the truth
I figured out where this feeling's coming from
And my finger's pointing right at you

You make me feel like an angel inside
Something that I can't hide no more
And if this feeling goes away, I will cry
If you wanna know why
'Cause you make me feel good inside

So what's the deal? What I feel is real
I don't have to say no more
Just hold my hand, say you understand
We can be together forever, baby

Everyday thinking 'bout your face
I can't wait to tell you the truth
I figured out where this feeling's coming from
And my finger's pointing right at you

You make me feel like an angel inside
Something that I can't hide no more
And if this feeling goes away, I will cry
If you wanna know why
'Cause you make me feel good inside

I wanna let you know what I feel right now
Everywhere you go, I just wanna be around
If you only knew what I think about you
Maybe then you'll see that you need me, baby, me

You make me feel like an angel inside
Something that I can't hide no more
And if this feeling goes away, I will cry
If you wanna know why
'Cause you make me feel good inside

You make me feel like an angel inside
Something that I can't hide no more
And if this feeling goes away, I will cry
If you wanna know why
'Cause you make me feel good inside
You make me feel like an angel inside
Something that I can't hide, no more
