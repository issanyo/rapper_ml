[Chorus]
All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby

[Verse 1]
I feel so strange thinking about you
After all the wrong you've done to me
I can't go on feeling like I do
'Cause my heart loves you, I'm so confused

[Chorus]
All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby

[Verse 2]
Don't waste my time
Cause someone like me you'll never find
I thought we had a good thing
But I was wrong and now I must move on

[Bridge]
To another love, one that I can trust
With my heart, I know she'll never run away
Just can't talk no more, so I'm out the door
Talk to me, why you wanna play love games?

[Chorus]
All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby
All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby

[Bridge]
To another love, one that I can trust
With my heart, I know she'll never run away
Just can't talk no more, so I'm out the door
Talk to me, why you wanna play love games?

[Chorus]
All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby
All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby
