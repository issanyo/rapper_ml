[Verse One: Red Cafe]
I'm the hottest in the hood, chick game silly
Chick hand in my draws tryin to Free Willy
Now all y'all really tryin to rhyme like me
Boy verse fly like I wrote in on the plane
Huh! Push weight no Royce
Now the check cleared Shakedown, Bad Boy
Hottest in the world, hottest in the game
Rap King James, I'maa put it on the chain
Big hog at the valet DAMN
Get 'em on they toes like it's ballet DAAAAAAAMMMMMMNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!
Yeah! I get my 2Pac on
Thuglife hottest in the hood dot com

[Verse Two: Juganot]
Yeah, when you on the eastside, homie ask about me
Juganot, ain't nobody that could doubt me
Hot up in the hood like a Jag or Audi
I'm hot like ridin camel back in Saudi Arabia
The boy's beha-vior - is rowdy!
Strapped on that +Iron Man+ like Rob Downey
Hotter than a crucifix at Klan rallies
Got crews of chicks sweatin me like Ballys (Work it out)
I'm hot up in the hood like a Hemi (VROOM!)
Like Eddie role, anywhere with a semi
That'll +Ghost+ you and your click like Patrick and Demi
With one eye closed, holdin the hand real steady

[Chorus: Red Cafe]
And the beat goes on, and the beat goes on, and the beat goes on
And the beat goes on, and the beat goes on, and the beat goes on

I'm the hottest nigga, in the hooooooooooddddddddd!!!!!
I'm the hottest nigga, in the hooooooooooddddddddd!!!!!

[Verse Three: Papoose]
Papoose, Pa-Poose! I'm the best in the world
I talk like a Webstar record "GO GIRL!!!"
Got the AK's, y'all could die
I keep the two K's with me, like Karl Kani
I'm a show 'em how to bring pain
Put some wholes in his white tee, that's what I call T-Pain
Go get some anti-freeze, I think they should
I'm like the engine, I'm the hottest thing in the hood

[Verse Four: Ross Fortune] (Red Cafe)
Touchdown!!! If you're small-time grindin, you gettin that Fool's Gold
With me, I'm a pitch it, I'll kick it like foosball
Piff pills, hard wired or some good raw
Main reason we the hottest in the hood dawg
(Yeah, Ross Fortune) - Ask about me
(That Shakedown Marcel)-  Ask about me
Ross Fortune on deck, lot of stacks around me
No guards, just shooters that'll blast around me
If it ain't Shakedown, then it ain't im-POR-tant
If it ain't about money, that shit sound foreign
When you hear "Touchdown", know that's Fortune
We scorin, it's movin, we got it in motion - Touchdown

[Chorus: Red Cafe]
And the beat goes on, and the beat goes on, and the beat goes on
And the beat goes on, and the beat goes on, and the beat goes on

I'm the hottest nigga, in the hooooooooooddddddddd!!!!!
I'm the hottest nigga, in the hooooooooooddddddddd!!!!!
I'm the hottest nigga, in the hooooooooooddddddddd!!!!!

[Verse Five: Kardinal Offishall]
I'm the hottest in yo' hood, hottest in yo' block
Wall Street economics with a T-Dot bop
Got my passport lookin like Weezy's tattoos
Flyin from hood to hood Mr. International
Slums I roll by the clubs of Philly
Suburbs of ATL tryin to wife Chilli
Jamaica Ave. silly, shoppin like I must
Be the only Konvict nigga the hood discuss
Besides my homey Red, Rock City and The Boss
T-Pain lost a couple teeth but he still floss
Get it, I'm a monster America Online
I'm a foreigner, better than Barack in his prime

[Verse Six: Uncle Murda]
I know I'm hot, it ain't the marijuana
If I ain't, then Chris Brown ain't hit Rihanna (He even BIT her!!!)
And you can't say I ain't the truth
That's like sayin if the cops think you got a gun
They ain't 'gon shoot (BLOAW!)
I'm on fire, the haters still hatin on me
Flow so hot, Satan in Hell waitin on me (I'm hotter than HIM!!!)
'Cause of me, err'body rappin tougher
I call 'em lil' Kanyes' and I'm they +Big Brother+
(Word to MUTHA!!!)
