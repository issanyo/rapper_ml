If I gave you everything baby would you give it back
I'll give my all to you
If I gave my heart to you baby would you give it back
Tell me what would you do

Some nights you ain't never change
You want sunshine and the rain
You want everything
You want too much from me
Girl if I gave you everything
My mansion and my plane and my name
You want too much from me

The way I love you girl
You should do the same
Some things never change
No more pain thank god you came girl
I'll give you my first
I'll give you my last
Never gotta ask
I'll do anything for you girl

If I gave you everything baby would you give it back
I'll give my all to you
If I gave my heart to you baby would you give it back
Tell me what would you do

Some nights you ain't never change
Think you could fix everything
But the diamond ring
That's not enough for me
Boy if I gave you everything
My mansion and my plane
Just stay the same
And that's enough for me yeah

The way I love you girl
You should do the same
Some things never change
No more pain thank god you came girl
I'll give you my first

If I gave you everything baby would you give it back
I'll give my all to you
If I gave my heart to you baby would you give it back
Tell me what would you do

Whatever you need
Can't even believe it
Would you do that for me
Close my hands I'm breathing
And my heart is beating
I'll give you everything

Yeah check us out
It's easy to laugh
Those white sands and plush yachts
Citation 10's and what not
But what if we ain't never touched drops
What if a nigga was on the bus stop
All black shades black hat black fitted
But no black car would you still be committed
Would you still let me hit it
Would you still ride if it was a Civic
I'm just hoping you will stay
On your knees and still pray
I'm just saying what I feel babe
So feel me in a real way

Whatever you need
Can't even believe it
Would you do that for me
Close my hands I'm breathing
And my heart is beating
I'll give you everything
That's what you are

If I gave you everything baby would you give it back
I'll give my all to you
If I gave my heart to you baby would you give it back
Tell me what would you do
