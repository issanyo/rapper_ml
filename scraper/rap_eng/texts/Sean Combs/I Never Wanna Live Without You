[Intro]
Can't live without you
(Can't live without you)
Can't live without you, baby
(Ohhh)
Can't live without you

[Chorus]
I never wanna live without you, baby
(No, I can't)
I wanna be your lady
Your love is so amazing
(I don't wanna live without you)
I never wanna live without you, baby
(Noooooo)
I wanna be your lady
Your love is so amazing

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige + (Faith Evans)]
What is this feeling?
I can't sleep at night
Just thinking 'bout being without you
Work 'til I'm tired
And I can't eat a bite (Can't eat a bite)
'Cause I know someday you're going away

[Chorus]
I never wanna live without you, baby
I wanna be your lady (I don't wanna live...)
Your love is so amazing
(...don't wanna be without you)
I never wanna live without you, baby
I wanna be your lady
(No, no, no, no, no)
Your love is so amazing

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige + (Faith Evans)]
I have the man that I want
I prayed so many nights for you (Down on my knees)
And then my prayers came true of you
Now that I have the answer
I'll be wishing on a star
I'll follow you where you are

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige + (Faith Evans)]
I don't wanna be alone
So baby, let's stay together (Stay together)
Through any kind of weather, yeah
Let's make a happy home (Make a happy home)
Because you mean so much to me baby
That's why I wanna be your lady

[Chorus]
I never wanna live without you, baby
I wanna be your lady
(I don't want to live...)
Your love is so amazing
(...don't wanna live without you)
I never wanna live without you, baby
I wanna be your lady
Your love is so amazing
(I can't live my life without you)
I never wanna live without you, baby
I wanna be your lady
(I said I don't want...I don't wanna live...)
Your love is so amazing
(I don't know; no, I don't know, no, no)
I never wanna live without you, baby
I wanna be your lady
Your love is so amazing

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige + (Faith Evans)]
I don't wanna be alone
So baby let's stay together (Stay together)
Through any kind of weather
Let's make this a happy home (Make a happy home)
Because you mean so much to me, baby
That's why I wanna be your lady

[Chorus]
I never wanna live without you, baby
I wanna be your lady
(I wanna be your lady)
Your love is so amazing
(I wanna be your lady)
I never wanna live without you, baby
I wanna be your lady
Your love is so amazing
(I can't live my life without you)

[Outro: Faith Evans + (Mary J. Blige)]
Baby, won't you stay with me a little while?
(Baby, won't you stay?)
Baby, won't you stay with me a little while? Don't leave
(Stay with me for a little while)
Baby, won't you stay with me a little while?
(All I wanna know is...)
Baby, won't you stay with me a little while? Don't leave
(...can you stay? Oh, why...)
Baby, won't you stay with me a little while?
(...won't you stay with me?)
Baby, won't you stay with me a little while? Don't leave
(I need you)
Baby, won't you stay with me a little while?
(Oh, I need you
I need your warm embrace)
Baby, won't you stay with me a little while? Don't leave
(I need your sweet, sweet taste, baby; C'mon, c'mon)
Baby, won't you stay with me a little while?
(C'mon, c'mon
Stay with me)
Baby, won't you stay with me a little while? Don't leave
(Stay, stay...)
Baby, won't you stay with me a little while?
Baby, won't you stay with me a little while? Don't leave
(Please stay)
Baby, won't you stay with me a little while?
