Meet me in the hotel lobby
I heard you lookin' for a freak
Me and you kissin' in the elevators
Come to room 343
I'm in bed with my neglegie
Waitin' for you to come in
Aye yo I'm kinda of bother cause
An innocent girl gonna sing

Chorus

I can't help it it's the freak in me
That gets me hot and so nasty
Make me wanna take my clothes off
I got sex to last all night long

(Pam)
I heard you had a girlfriend
(tell her you'll be late)
And if she gets an attitude
Then tell her she can come participate
For all I care now
It's enough for you to go around
And if she don't wanna share baby
Then tell her I'm gettin' mine's now

Chorus

I can't help it, it's the freak in me
That gets me hot, and so nasty
Make me wanna take my clothes off
I got sex to last all night long

I can't help it, it's the freak in me
That gets me hot, and so nasty
Make me wanna take my clothes off
I got sex to last all night long

Bet she can't hang with the Bad Girls
Cause when she's down, she stays down
It's all over
Bet she can't hang with the Bad Girls
Cause when she's down, she stays down
It's all over

Bet she can't hang with the Bad Girls
Cause when she's down, she stays down
It's all over
Bet she can't hang with the Bad Girls

Chorus

I can't help it, it's the freak in me
That gets me hot, and so nasty
Make me wanna take my clothes off
I got sex to last all night long

I can't help it, it's the freak in me
That gets me hot, and so nasty
Make me wanna take my clothes off
I got sex to last all night long
