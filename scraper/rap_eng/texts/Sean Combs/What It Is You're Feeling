[Diddy:]
Ladies and Gentleman
Your dreams have now been full filled
Let's get up
And let's get ill

Yeah, come on
Uh, Bad Boy, baby
Dream, come on
Let's go

[Dream:]
We've both known each other
Now, for quite a while
And I think it's been kinda cool
But we've both been holding out
Cause I can see by the way you look at me
That it's a little more deep
Than what we make it seem, oh

Baby boy, there's no way
That I can hold it inside
Can't ignore
The way I'm feeling
And I can't let it by

Tell me
Are you gonna be?
Let me know if it's just me
Don't wanna ask too many things
Is it real or just a dream?

I'm not gonna hide
What I feel inside
Won't put up a fight
Cause it feels so right

I can't even lie
(Can't even lie)
(To you)
How I waste your time
(No)
I just gotta know
What it is you're feeling

[Diddy {Dream}:]
(Da, da, da)
Your dreams have now been full filled
(Da, da, da)
Let's get up and let's get ill

Yeah, let's go
Come on
One, two
Second verse
Sing it, shorty

[Dream:]
I wish I could show you what you mean to me
But I'm not sure if you will even see what I see
And you don't know how deep our feelings go
But I can let them show
I can't help myself
They keep on going

Baby boy
(Baby boy)
There's no way
That I can hold it inside
Can't ignore
(Can't ignore)
The way I'm feeling
(The way I'm feeling, oh oh)
And I can't let it by

Tell me
Are you gonna be?
(Are you gonna be?)
Let me know if it's just me
(Oh)
Don't wanna ask too many things
Is it real or just a dream?
(Is it just a dream)

I'm not gonna hide (no, no)
What I feel inside
Won't put up a fight
Cause it feels so right
(I won't put up a fight)

I can't even lie
How I waste your time
I just gotta know
What it is you're feeling

Wonder what it could be like
If you would open up
Come inside
Don't try to fight the feeling
You know what I'm revealing

When I feel like empty nights
And when you look into my eyes
I see and I'm so anxious for you
(For you)

What's this that I'm feeling?
Is it really real?
And you say that it happened to me
What's happening?

I'm not trying to hide it
I don't wanna fight it
This is what I'm feeling
Baby, let it happen

[Diddy:]
Bad boy, baby
Inside of every bad boy
There's a bad girl
And we won't stop
Cause we can't stop
Dream!
