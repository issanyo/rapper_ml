[112]
Oh I need to know where we stand
Do we share this special thing called love
I know I do, what about you
I just can't get enough of the time
I need you in my life
Where do we go
What do I do
I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel
Like I am the only one for you
Girl I want to be with you
No one else, only you
Why can't we just make it happen
Baby, I need you in my life
Every time I'm with you
Never want it to come to an end
Always make me so happy
You'll always have a place in my heart
I need you in my life
Where do I go
What do I do
Cause I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel
Like I am the only one for you!


[Notorious B. I. G.]
Je-sus the notorious just
Please us with your lyrical thesis
We just chillin,milk em,top billin
Silk and pure linen, me and little Ceas
Malibu sea breeze, Dom P's, palm trees
Cats lay low like Pablo in milked out diablos ( That's right)
The Williest, bitches be the silliest
The more I smoke, the smaller the phillie gets
Room 112 where the players dwell
And stash more cash than Bert Padell, inhale
Inhale make you feel godd like Tony Toni Tone (feels good)
Dig up in your middle like Monie (yes)
Don't know but your settin up to blow me (yes)
Try to style, Fly up north with a homey (Yes)
Escada, Don Dada, player, stay splurging
Game so tight they call it virgin (Yes)




[112 with Slim ad libs until the song fades away]
Where do we go
What must I do
If I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel, baby
Like I am the only one for you
Girl I want to be with you
No one else, only you
Why can't we just make it happen
Baby, I need you in my life
