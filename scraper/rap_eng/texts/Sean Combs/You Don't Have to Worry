[Chorus]
You don't have to worry
You're gonna have a good time
I came to get down for mine
You don't have to worry
You're gonna have a good time
I came to get down for mine

[Verse 1]
No more doubts
Baby, you can rest your mind
I will keep you satisfied
I will make you feel
The way you never felt before
No more fears
I will keep your mind at ease
I will love you tenderly
I will be there if you need me, so

[Chorus]
You don't have to worry
You're gonna have a good time
I came to get down for mine
You don't have to worry
You're gonna have a good time
I came to get down for mine

[Verse 2]
Take my hand
Baby, I will lead the way
I can show you brighter days
Love you in so many ways
No more loneliness
I will be there next to you
Holding you and kissing you
I'll be all you want me to, yeah, so

[Chorus]
You don't have to worry
You're gonna have a good time
I came to get down for mine
You don't have to worry
You're gonna have a good time
I came to get down for mine

[Bridge]
Girl, you're all I ever wanted (all I ever wanted)
There's no stronger love than mine for you
There's no way that I could ever
I could ever let you down
So don't worry, baby, I'll keep it true

[Chorus]
You don't have to worry
You're gonna have a good time
I came to get down for mine
You don't have to worry
You're gonna have a good time
I came to get down for mine

You don't have to worry
You're gonna have a good time
I came to get down for mine
You don't have to worry
You're gonna have a good time
I came to get down for mine

You don't have to worry
You're gonna have a good time
I came to get down for mine
You don't have to worry
You're gonna have a good time
I came to get down for mine

You don't have to worry
You're gonna have a good time
I came to get down for mine
