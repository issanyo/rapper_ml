[Intro: Father MC + (singers)]
(Would you do for me)
Sweetheart
(Would you do for me)
I'm talking to you and no one else
I just want you to know...
(Would you do for me)
...that I'll do for you

[Hook (Repeat 4X)]
If you do for me
I will do for you

[Verse 1: Father MC]
Well, excuse me, let me let you know the time
On, how I feel and what's on my mind
It's you that I want to be in my life
And if it's possible, you will be my wife
I lead you in the right direction, of course
Never play you out, so there's no loss
I'll be your love daddy, just wait and see
That me and you, we were meant to be

[Hook: Singers + (Mary J. Blige ad-libs)]
If you do for me (I'll do)
I will do for you (For you)
If you do for me (I'll do...)
I will do for you (...I'll do for you)
If you do for me (I'll do)
I will do for you (For you...)
If you do for me
I will do for you

[Verse 2: Father MC]
I wanna treat ya like a queen
Cook and clean
Get your bubble bath ready so I can rub you with Noxzem'
And watch how gentle I'll be when I rub your back
And after that there's dinner and cognac
A little romance for the quiet storm
And a lotta lovin' for the whole night long
I'm gonna caress ya body and give you a kiss
And, uh, rub you down where you been missed
Nibble and your navel and kiss your thigh
Play with your hair 'cause I'm on a love-high
Well, I don't know, it's the way that I am
Introduce me to your mother and I'll say 'Hello, ma'am'
Well, I don't know, it's the way I was brought up
Respect my female and never get caught up
In another affair and I believe the same
If you try to be slick, then the doors will open

[Hook: Singers + (Mary J. Blige ad-libs)]
(I'll do) If you do for me
(For you) I will do for you
(I'll do it for you) If you do for me
(I'll do for you...) I will do for you
If you do for me
I will do for you
If you do for me
I will do for you

[Interlude: Father MC]
Yeah, you know, sweetheart
I told you once
And I don't feel I have to tell you anymore
It's you that I want
And it's you, that I'll do for

[Verse 3: Father MC]
Since we both know what we want, let's get it together
And fly like two birds of a feather
'Cause I'mma protect me and look out for my
Feelings and that's why I always try
To be loyal and gentle, lay and let
Observe the female in case I must leave camp
And if I have to break out, you don't deserve
To live a good life and love a black hummingbird
It may be sexy but it is true
If you try to adore me, then I'll adore you
But if you treat me right, then
I'll treat you with opens arms and a rose just to greet you
Love you dearly, respect and care for
You my dear, so how could you ignore
The way I feel is real from the start
So I stopped playing games and mastered the art

[Hook: Singers + (Mary J. Blige ad-libs)]
If you do for me
I will do for you (I'll do...)
If you do for me
I will do for you (...for you...)
If you do for me
I will do for you
If you do for me
I will do for you (I'll do for you)
If you do for me (I'll do...)
I will do for you (...for you)
If you do for me (I'll do...)
I will do for you (I'll do for you)
