[Chorus]
Don't you take your love from me
I'll be there
You can always count on me, baby
Don't you take your love from me
I'll be there
You can always count on me, baby

[Verse 1]
At some point, sometime you'll need
Someone there for you, and I will be the one
So whenever you need, don't be afraid of me
Call on me, and I will give to you

[Chorus]
Don't you take your love from me
I'll be there
You can always count on me, baby
Don't you take your love from me
I'll be there
You can always count on me, baby

[Verse 2]
All you want, you need, my time
I wanna give because
You're a special part of me
See, I know you need many things to feel complete
That's why you should never have to hesitate

[Bridge]
No matter what you think
I'm gonna always do things for you, girl
I will take care of you
My word is all you need
And you'll see that I'll, I'll never let you down
No, no, no, no
And I'll be there for you, baby
I will never let you down

[Chorus]
Don't you take your love from me
I'll be there
You can always count on me, baby
Don't you take your love from me
I'll be there
You can always count on me, baby
Don't you take your love from me
I'll be there
You can always count on me, baby

[Bridge]
No matter what you think
I'm gonna always do things for you, girl
I will take care of you
My word is all you need
And you'll see that I'll, I'll never let you down
So...

[Chorus]
Don't you take your love from me
I'll be there
You can always count on me, baby
Don't you take your love from me
I'll be there
You can always count on me, baby
Don't you take your love from me
I'll be there
You can always count on me, baby
Don't you take your love from me
I'll be there
You can always count on me, baby
