[Chorus]
I'm so glad that you came and found me
Don't have to cry 'cause it's all right
I'm so glad that you came and found me
Anything you need, you know I'll be much obliged

[Verse 1]
The time has come to let you know
Just what I'm feeling
I'm feeling in my soul
I never wanted, no, to fall so deep for you
But now you've got me completely in love
But if you wanna know

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna now, then I will have to show
To show you what I'm feeling, baby, feeling in my heart
Never be afraid, you can count on me
'Cause I'll protect you
I'll respect you
I'll always be around

[Chorus]
I'm so glad that you came and found me
Don't have to cry 'cause it's all right
I'm so glad that you came and found me
Anything you need, you know I'll be much obliged

[Verse 2]
Please don't be alarmed by my hesitation
To notice your charm
I wasn't too optimistic about it at first
But now I'm so, so very glad

[Chorus]
I'm so glad that you came and found me
Don't have to cry 'cause it's all right
I'm so glad that you came and found me
Anything you need, you know I'll be much obliged

[Bridge]
People say that love can be unkind
It can tear your heart to pieces
And shake you up inside
But I don't worry about tomorrow
'Cause I believe in the power of love
Break it down

[Harmonizing]

[Outro]
Thinking about you
Can't live without you
Anything that you need
Baby, you can count on me
Thinking about you
Can't live without you
Anything that you need
Baby, you can count on me
Thinking about you
Can't live without you
Anything that you need
Baby, you can count on me
Thinking about you
Can't live without you
Anything that you need
Baby, you can count on me
Thinking about you
Can't live without you
Anything that you need
Baby, you can count on me
Thinking about you
Can't live without you
Anything that you need
Baby, you can count on me
Thinking about you
Can't live without you
Anything that you need
Baby, you can count on me
