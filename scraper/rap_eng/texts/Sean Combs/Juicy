You know very well
Who you are
Don't let them hold you down
Reach up for the stars
If you have that goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
That gives you good and plenty

Well it was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smoking on Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid
Yes god bless the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
Blowing up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood
It's all good, it's all so good
And if you don't know, now you know, you know

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let them hold you down
Reach up for the stars
If you have that goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
That gives you good and plenty

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50 inch screen
Money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is lounging
Celebrating every day, no more public housing
Thinking back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirsty
Dang right I like the life I live
Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all... so good
If you don't know, now you know, you know, you know

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let them hold you down
Reach up for the stars
If you have that goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
That gives you good and plenty

[Instrumental]

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let them hold you down
Reach up for the stars
If you have that goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
That will give you

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let them hold you down
Reach up for the stars
If you have that goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
If you don't know, now you know
