[Intro]
Ooh
You remind me, yeah
You remind me of such sweet memories

REMIX

Yo Puff, that’s that knock right there, boy

[Chorus]
You know that you remind me
Of a love that I once knew
Yes, you do, oh
You know that you remind me
Of a love that I once knew
Yes, it’s true, oh

[Verse 1]
You, you remind me of a love that I once knew
Is it a dream or is it déjà vu?
I just had to let you know so I had to sing it
‘Cause for you, boy, I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
And the way you walk and
And the way you talk and
The way you move and
You remind me, yes you do
Of the way you dress and
The way you dance and
You really like to groove and
You remind me
Yes, you do

[Chorus]
You know that you remind me
Of a love that I once knew
Yes, you do, oh
You know that you remind me
Of a love that I once knew
Yes, it’s true, oh

[Verse 2]
You, you remind me of a memory
And this is something you should know
Sweet baby darling, come on just stop playing with my mind
‘Cause for you, boy, I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
The way you walk and
The way you talk and
The way you move and
The way you dress and
The way you dance and
You really like to groove and
You remind me
You remind me

[Chorus]
You know that you remind me
Of a love that I once knew
Yes, you do, oh
You know that you remind me
Of a love that I once knew
Yes, it’s true, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And the way you walk and
The way you talk and
The way you move and
You remind me, yes you do
The way you dress and
The way you dance and
You really like to groove and
You remind me
You remind me

[Chorus]
You know that you remind me
Of a love that I once knew
Yes, you do, oh
You know that you remind me
Of a love that I once knew
Yes, it’s true, oh

[Rap: Greg Nice]
Mary’s infatuated, in love with you
Skiddly wah wah, Pepe Le Pew
Picnics in the park, strolling, holding hands
Picking cotton candy from the candy man
I got a flashback, uh, counterattack
Hugs and kisses, love and don’t lack
Déjà vu of me hugging you, holding you, and squeezing you
Memories reminding me of you

(“That’s the way the story goes; that’s just the way the story goes”)

[Chorus (Repeat 3X)]
You know that you remind me
Of a love that I once knew
Yes, it’s true, oh
You know that you remind me
Of a love that I once knew
Yes, you do, oh

You know, that you remind me…
