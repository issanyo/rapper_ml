[Chorus: Pharrell]
A nigga finna get loose, huh
A nigga finna get loose, huh
A nigga finna get loose, huh
A nigga finna get loose, huh

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy/Pharrell]
Where you from, where that at
Where you heading, what is that
What you doing, feeling that
Get that fucking cake up, open your mind
Keep your distance unless you wanna get with this
Me and the renegade, black grenade, blowin' up mines, diamond's blue
Chop it like sumo
Nigga hungry like Cujo
Smoking that Pluto
No ticking time like hand on the rope
Nigga feel beautiful
No park brake but a nigga in neutral

[Bridge]
You wanna roll some grass, go and do that
You ain't trying to pass, don't do that
You gotta drink to mask, don't do that
Finna act a ass, go and do that
Say what now

[Chorus: Pharrell]
A nigga finna get loose, huh
A nigga finna get loose, huh
A nigga finna get loose, huh
A nigga finna get loose, huh

[Verse 2]
Get back down, get on up, get on up
This is what, truth feels like, so uncut
I'm in love on that cline, me rockin' Moncler
White chick, long hair, but with a black man yeah
I shine like this, luminescent spit
Get bright right quick
This as good as it get, two top floors of the motherfuckin' Ritz
I only like hits, since P.E. see a nigga never miss
You see this black fist
A nigga come number one like the old Limp Biz

[Bridge]
You wanna roll some grass, go and do that
You ain't trying to pass, don't do that
You gotta drink to mask, don't do that
Finna act a ass, go and do that
Say what now

[Chorus: Pharrell]
A nigga finna get loose, huh
A nigga finna get loose, huh
A nigga finna get loose, huh
A nigga finna get loose, huh

[Outro]
Ain't no more to it
We out, remember me now?
Let's dance
Yeah, yeah
I see you dance, all the dances you know what to do
I made this part for you and you and you and you and you and you, you, you, you!
Bad boy
