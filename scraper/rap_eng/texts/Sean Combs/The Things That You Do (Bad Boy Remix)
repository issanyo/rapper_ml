The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you (repeat 2X)

Baby baby baby
These feelings that I have
I can't explain, and I can't believe that it's you
The way you make me feel
Makes me happy, so why can't we just make it last

The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you (repeat 2X)

The love you give to me
Turns me on inside, and I can't deny how I feel
Don't go, the things you do to me
Makes me happy, so don't you take your love away

The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you (repeat 4X)
Every little thing
Aowwww... keep on

The way that you walk
The way that you talk
The way that you, give your love to me
Don't ever take your love, away... baby don't you go-ohhh
