Chorus:
Mr. telephone man, there’s something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby’s number, I get a click every time
Mr. telephone man, there’s something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby’s number, I get a click every time

When I dial 6-1-1 paid service
She said “hello, may I help you please”
I told her something must be wrong with my phone
Cause my baby wouldn’t hang up on me

Chorus:
Mr. telephone man, there’s something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby’s number, I get a click every time
Mr. telephone man, there’s something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby’s number, I get a click every time

He let the phone ring
20 times before he answered
Let me tell you what happened then
A minute later, I got the operator, saying
“Please hang up and place you call again” baby

Chorus:
Mr. telephone man
There’s something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby’s number
I get a click every time
Mr. telephone man
Something’s wrong with the line
(There’s something wrong with my line)
When I dial his number
(When I dial my baby’s number)
(I get a click every time)

Some strange woman is on the telephone (the telephone)
Keeps telling me that my baby, he ain’t home (that he’s not home)
He ain’t got no party line, this situation blows my mind
Oh... I just can’t take this anymore

Bridge:
Please operator, see what you can do
I dialed the right number, but I still couldn’t get through
Would you just check the wire, his number one more time if you can
I’m pretty sure he’s phone ain’t being answered by no woman

Chorus:
Mr. telephone man
There’s something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby’s number
I get a click every time
Mr. telephone man
Something’s wrong with the line
(There’s something wrong with my line)
When I dial his number
(When I dial my baby’s number)
(I get a click every time)

Must be a bad connection
With my loving affection
Ah Baby, I just can’t take this no more
This situation blows my mind
Can’t get my baby on the line
(On the line)

Chorus:
Mr. telephone man (I tried dialing information)
There’s something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby’s number (I get no cooperation)
I get a click every time
Mr. telephone man (Mr. on the phone telling me my baby ain’t home)
There’s something wrong with my line
When I dial my baby’s number (ah baby)
I get a click every time (I just can’t take it anymore)

Mr. telephone man (help me out)
There’s something wrong with my line (please Mr. Telephone Man)
When I dial my baby’s number (help me out)
I get a click every time (please Mr. Telephone Man)
Mr. telephone man there’s something wrong with the line (Mr. Telephone Man)
When I dial his number I get a click every time...
