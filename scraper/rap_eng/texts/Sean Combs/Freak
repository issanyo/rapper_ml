As we proceed, Cheri Dennis
A new star is born
A new star is born

Walked in the club, mad thugs on the dance floor
Dj calling all girls to the dance floor. Ooo wee
Damn, Need I say more, Pay attention friction's
What I came for. Rock n Rollin, dude gettin close
Like what I'm clothe in, - lookin swollen
Looked into my eyes and so hypnotizing
Felt like something in his pants got to rising
(Heat sweat, feel the sweat)
Chemical Reaction
(I don't mind feelin wet)
Time for sum action
Looked at his boys all proud like he doin it
So I threw it back and his - startin to lose it

I'm in control now, that's what I told him
Movin up and down like I'm workin a pole and
Whispered in his ear put my pimp game in motion
3....2....1...contact expolosion

Ooo wee
Be a freak to the core
Give it to him once, he's gonna
Want some more
10....9.....8....7.....6....5.....4
Put him on the floor, put it on him like drawers
Ooo wee
Be a freak to the core
Give it to him once, he's gonna
Want some more
10....9.....8....7.....6....5.....4
Put him on the floor, put it on him like drawers
Ooo wee
Be a freak
Be a freak
Be a freak
Be a freak

Off to the bar, put a drink in my system
Lookin at the floor searching for my next victim
Spot one, got one
Name my position, - started switchin
Freak on a mission, Ooo Wee Oh My God
Freak from my lips to my hips to my thighs
He a pretty boy but he tryin to play hard so
I'ma break him down like a ?? cigar
Got him watchin everything I'm doin
His body's groovin with everything I'm movin
Threw it back once, something confusing
Sex is a game it's a shame that he's losing
Uh Oh, Something's bulging I can see it
Through his clothing. His eyes closing, fingers
Roaming, listen closely someone's moaning

I'm in control now, that's what I told him
Movin him up and down like I'm workin a pole and
Whispered in his ear put my pimp game in motion
3....2....1...contact here we go again

Ooo wee
Be a freak to the core
Give it to him once, he's gonna
Want some more
10....9.....8....7.....6....5.....4
Put him on the floor, put it on him like drawers
Ooo wee
Be a freak to the core
Give it to him once, he's gonna
Want some more
10....9.....8....7.....6....5.....4
Put him on the floor, put it on him like drawers
Ooo wee
Be a freak
Be a freak
Be a freak
Be a freak

Yea...Yea...
Watch me take a good look at my body
From the top to the bottom you know I'm a hottie
Throw it a little harder makin them knowin
That I'm small in the waist but my ass is swollen
Like Linc and Honey wanna know what I'm drinkin
Never dance in the club too much, Get hot then I stop
But not for good I take a break and then
I'm back in your face
Backing it up making it pop (Pop, Pop)
Turn around, eye
Contact and then make it drop
I know you see me alot every
Week at the club on the dance floor
Freak till I be free

Ooo wee
Be a freak to the core
Give it to him once, he's gonna
Want some more
10....9.....8....7.....6....5.....4
Put him on the floor, put it on him like drawers
Ooo wee
Be a freak to the core
Give it to him once, he's gonna
Want some more
10....9.....8....7.....6....5.....4
Put him on the floor, put it on him like drawers
Ooo wee
Be a freak
Be a freak
Be a freak
Be a freak
