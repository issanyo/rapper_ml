Willing and waiting but it's all up to you

The very first, time I layed my eyes on you
I knew you were the one
Loving, can't compare to all the times
That we both had some fun

Sometimes I wanna cry
Cause boy I realize
I need you in my life
Don't think he understands
I want him for my man
I'm waiting for you

Willing and waiting so in love with you
Willing and waiting boy it's all on you
Willing and waiting boy I need the truth
Willing and waiting I'm so in love with you

Everytime, boy I take one look at you
I see the sunday shine
When we're alone, never want the night to end
Cause you're the one I want

Sometimes I wanna cry
Cause boy I realize
I need you in my life
Don't think he understands
I want him for my man
I'm waiting for you

Willing and waiting so in love with you
Willing and waiting boy it's all on you
Willing and waiting boy I need the truth
Willing and waiting I'm so in love with you

You better answer
You better answer

Sometimes I wanna cry
Cause boy I realize
I need you in my life
Don't think he understands
I want him for my man
I'm waiting for you

Willing and waiting so in love with you
Willing and waiting boy it's all on you
Willing and waiting boy I need the truth
Willing and waiting I'm so in love with you
