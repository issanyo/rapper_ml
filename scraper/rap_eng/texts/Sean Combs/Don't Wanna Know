[Verse 1]
Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you (you)
I just kept it to myself

[Build]
I don't wanna know (no, I don't wanna know)
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low (oh, oh, oh)
Cause my heart can't take it anymore (no, I don't wanna know)
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh baby, I don't wanna know

[Drop]
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
Oh Baby, I don't wanna know

[Verse 2]
I think about it when I hold you (oh)
When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe
I don't need to know the truth (oh, oh, oh)
Baby keep it to yourself

[Build]
I don't wanna know (No, I don't wanna know)
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low (oh, oh, oh)
Cause my heart can't take it anymore (no, I don't wanna know)
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh baby, I don't wanna know

[Drop]
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
Oh Baby, I don't wanna know

[Drop 2]
No, No, No, No, I don't wanna know
Cause my heart can't take it anymore

[End]
No, I don't wanna know
