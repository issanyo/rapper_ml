What is a friend
Could it be that it's just a word
Or something in your life that you've heard
Or just another one of those big fat lies
Because many nights this word has made me cry
So hard my stomach hurts deep down inside

Uh oh there goes that word again
How do we let it end
I thought you were my friend
I can't believe my very eyes
Right to my face you lied
Cause you're my so-called friend

How could you call yourself a friend
Oh oh there goes that word again
That brings people together and tears them apart
It's always said by those who claim they love you
When all the while they want to fill your shoes
And never calling you up with no good news

They're always happy when your through
They never want the best for you
They're always trying to fill your shoes
(I don't understand this kind of friend)

Uh oh there goes that word again
How do we let it end
I thought you were my friend
I can't believe my very eyes
Right to my face you lied
Cause you're my so-called friend

Opportunity's knocking here comes my friend
Uh oh there goes that word again
(they only come around when they need something y'all)

They call you everyday 'til they reel you in
And they want to hang out so you can spend on them
(I don't understand, I don't understand this kind of friend)

Uh oh there goes that word again
How do we let it end
I thought you were my friend
I can't believe my very eyes
Right to my face you lied
Cause you're my so-called friend

Uh oh there goes that word again
How do we let it end
I thought you were my friend
I can't believe my very eyes
Right to my face you lied
Cause you're my so-called friend
