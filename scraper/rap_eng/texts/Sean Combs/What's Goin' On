[Intro]
Ooh...oh...tell me, girl...oh...

[Chorus: Tony Thompson & Faith Evans]
Whats goin' on in your life?
Let me make things the way they should be tonight
I'm down on my knees
I'll do anything to please you
Oh, girl

[Verse 1]
Hey girl, don't walk away
I've been meaning to let you know
That you've got my mind in a daze
My heart's going crazy for you
Let me into your mind, whoa

[Chorus: Tony Thompson & Faith Evans]
Whats goin' on in your life?
Let me make things the way they should be tonight
I'm down on my knees
I'll do anything to please you
Oh, girl

[Verse 2]
So sad that he left you that way
With an unmended heart to heal
But I'm a good man and I know
The pain you might feel
So open your eyes
And see this good thing before it's gone

[Bridge]
You passed me by almost every day
Knowing all along you're lonely and I
Want ya baby
Need to make your life complete
'Cause it's empty without me

[Chorus: Tony Thompson & Faith Evans]
Whats goin' on in your life?
Let me make things the way they should be tonight
I'm down on my knees
I'll do anything to please you
Oh, girl
Tell me, girl
Whats goin' on in your life?
Let me make things the way they should be tonight
I'm down on my knees
I'll do anything to please you
Oh, girl

[Bridge]
You passed me by almost every day
Knowing all along you're lonely and I
Want ya baby
Need to make your life complete
'Cause it's empty without me

[Chorus: Tony Thompson & Faith Evans]
Whats going on in your life?
Let me make things the way they should be tonight
I'm down on my knees
I'll do anything to please you
Oh, girl

[Outro: Tony Thompson & Faith Evans]
Whatever it takes I'm gonna do it
Whatever you need I'm gonna give it
To prove my love for you is so strong
I'll stand right here until you're with me
No other can bring the joy you give me
Not one
Not one
Whatever it takes I'm gonna do it
Whatever you need I'm gonna give it
To prove my love for you is so strong
I'll stand right here until you're with me
No other can bring the joy you give me
Not one
Not one
