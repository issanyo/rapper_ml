Dseeva - Peaches N Cream (Remix) Lyrics

Sipping that beam /
Know what I mean? /
Sipping that beam…..

[Verse 1]

Guess who back on the track?
I rap circles ‘round ‘em – lap, then another lap /
And when I get it, ain't no coming back /
Imam keep on running with the cunt until I’m don with that /
I hope someone’s admirin’ /
Its been a while since I heard something inspirin’ /
Besides the rumours and the lies about me, myself and I
I’m here to straighten it out like I’m ironin’ /
Somebody called the firemen /
Tried putting me out, them hoes (hose) won’t try again /
Product of my environment, you’re a product expirin’ /
- ‘coz ain't nobody buyin’ it – cue the violins /
RIP – minute of silence / Shhh..
I’m just making a point /
24 beers and a doobie at your house - call it casin’ a joint (case & a joint) /
And if you’re thinking this songs about me -
I hope you get a kick out of it, Rhonda Rousey /
So run your mouth if you want to be knocked out /
Punch lines so hard that the beat drops out! /
Even the beats knocked out /
Have your boys saying “Look at all the problems that we’ve got now!” /
If you want to go toe to toe, and you come with your mate, i
LEFT – RIGHT – LATER /

[Hook]

Keep having dreams /
Police yelling ‘Freeze’ /
What’s in your jeans? /
Please have a seat and give me your keys /
What do you mean? /
I swear I got clean /
Give me some peace, Eastwood Police say ‘Dseeva’s a beast’ /

[Verse 2]

Why so serious? Just have a giggle at it /
You’re busy trying to be fly, but you’re still a maggot /
I was trying to unwind, look where I wound up /
I can take any beat and make that shit sound strut /
Drop it in one take, I keep the shit raw /
You gave me an inch, now I’m coming to get more /
I’m sick of the shit talk /
See a cunt who give me lip and stick the prick with a pitchfork while I crip-walk /
Jokes - LOL, LMAO, OMG / You know it’s me -
As soon as you check the potency /
And when you go to sleep – I’m in the lab workin’ /
Until the tracks perfect, and my back hurtin’ /
I’ve got the gift, but I battle the curse (Kers’) like ’60 /
There’s guys trying to stick a knife in my kidneys /
I live life like ride or die with me /
Coz imma get rich or die trying – like 50 /
I’m trying to write history – this is historic /
I’m dope, ive got it in the bag – this shits the chronic /
My presence (presents) is a gift, like a Christmas Stockin’ /
Got some Gin N Tonic sippin’ on it, its hypnotic /
I passed that blunt with flying colours /
Back when I used to traffic, like Michael Douglas /
I promised that bitch I wasn’t like the others /
Rooted and booted it, then went and high-fived my brothers /

[Hook]
