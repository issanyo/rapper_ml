Heyy, heyy, heyyy!
Heyy, heyy, heyyy!
Heyy, heyy, heyyy!

I don't know what I would do
Do without you
In my life boy
I don't know if I could live
Live without you
You bring me joy

You know if the time is right
I don't wanna fuss n fight
I just wanna let you know
I'm feeling good tonight
I want you to take my hand
And promise you'll be cool
Cause I know you like the way that I move

Oh, oh boy you bring me joy
Some try to play me
But they can't fade me
Oh, oh boy you've go it goin on
And you make me happy (happy)
So very happy

I don't know what I would do
Do without you
In my life boy
I don't know if I could live
Live without you
You bring me joy

You know when I think of you
I'm thinkin of myself
I just wanna be with you, my friend
And no one else
It's not hard
To say what I feel
Cause you know that my love is for real

Oh, oh boy I'll be your toy
Come on and play with me
And never leave me
Oh, oh boy you've got it goin on
And you satisfy me (yes you do)
You satisfy me

So much joy
In my world
Be my man
And I'll be your girl

I don't know what I would do
Do without you
In my life boy
I don't know if I could live
Live without you
You bring me joy

Wait just a minute
Something else is on my mind
I don't wanna have to tell you
This but one more time
You're the only man I want
And I ain't never gonna front
On ya baby so relax your mind
And realize

I don't know what I would do
Do without you
In my life boy
I don't know if I could live
Live without you
You bring me joy

I don't know what I would do
Do without you
In my life boy
I don't know if I could live
Live without you
You bring me joy

Realize that I'm gonna do you right
