[Chorus: K-Ci]  4x
If lovin’ you is all that I have to do
I don’t wanna do anything else

[Verse 1: K-Ci]
Every night and day I dream of another way
To tell you something good, I don’t think that I’m understood
You walk away and I frown with my head hung far down
You tell me what is wrong, you just wanna be loved all night long baby

[Chorus] 2x

[Verse 2: Mary J Blige]
You told me a thousand times that you would be mine all mine
I do everything for you but in your smile I still can’t find
Now you tell me this, this is something that I can miss
And all you want to do is to love me for me and I'll love you for you

[Chorus] 2x

[Verse 3: K-Ci & MJB]
[K-Ci]
Now that I know I’m gonna make love to you
So let it open up your heart
And let me in where I belong

[MJB]
If lovin’ you was all that I have to do
Then it won’t be wrong baby

[K-Ci & MJB]
Cause we belong together baby

[Bridge: K-Ci & MJB]
Together we will be as one
Just me and you, you, you, you
Will you love me? (I will love you)
Will you please me? (I will please you)
Girl don’t leave me (I won’t leave you)
Let's make it easy (I’ll make it easy)

[Chorus]  2x

[K-Ci] They could take my possessions, they could never take your love away from me
[MJB] See now listen with every breath I breathe and every beat of my heart
I know that no one, I know that no one can tear us apart
Cause I love you baby
[K-Ci] I love you too
[MJB] And I need you
[K-Ci] I need you too
Stay with me more than just a day
And you know, you know, you know
I love you
You make me feel so good, baby
