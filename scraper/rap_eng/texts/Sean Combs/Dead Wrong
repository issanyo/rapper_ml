[Hook]
The weak and the strong
Who got it going on?
You're dead wrong
The weak and the strong
Who got it going on?
You're dead wrong

I'll make it rain pain on your circle like a crop duster
Stole the show like a robber in a Blockbuster
To the chicken-shits and cocksuckers
Accept defeat, my CD is a sock-stuffer
Peeps don't pay attention when I make CDs
Even though I'm dope, call me Kool ADD
They need speed to see me when I slay these beats
What they mad for? Cuz they ain't elite
Smoke til it's misty, ash the jay
I'm the dealer kid, you need cash to play
Too many wack cats have been tryna rap of late
You're garbage, man, I'm taking out the trash today
Style is key, until that's locked down
You ain't fly, you're looking like Black Hawk Down
High priest, I'ma finna pack pot now
All-seeing eye, get your stash spot found
I rap hot how you hogs ever gon' step?
Roll a jay, get salad fingers, vegetable breath
I wanna power puff but no medical left
So I'm filling my cup up with Chemical X
Step with something sharp, get laid flat
I have rap down pat, you don't say jack
I want the fortune, yo, I'm tryna dip from Point
Keep a quarter in my pocket tryna flip a coin
On a quest for love to get rid of the black thoughts
Getting shot down by dimes, check the black box
Some rhymers don't realize I rap lots
One-liners go over their heads, knock their hats off
Like a gat cocked
In the hands of the Man With No Name
Flow game flame like propane
Take out a wack rapper like rice and lo mein
You're scaring birds away, because you got no brain
You got no heart, you're repping the price
Every punk with a pen's preaching weapons and vice
Your passion is purchased, my rapping is nice
You're scratching the surface cuz you're trapped under ice
I'm fly like a pigeon, die like a villain
Put you priss teens in a pristine prison
I'ma end my fifteen minutes with a big-screen finish
With your sister in Sistine sinning
I'm genocide mixed with Apocalypse Now
When I touch down I'ma be the talk of the town
I get you on your feet like you're walking around
And I'll be rocking it out like Pac in the crowd
I'm working on a mixtape to hawk in the street
Put my bars in your mouth, but not when you eat
Tongues tingle every time I talk on a beat
I'll never go pop, but I still rock and I'm sweet
The shit you talking is cheap, hate and hubris
Turn you Phantom of the Opera when you face the music
You Harvey Dent, I went harder, sent
A postcard with rent to your apartment
I thought I could help a little bit with the bills
Cuz you can't spell well and you'll never be ill
With every written
I'm clever as shit
Better marry into money or you'll never be rich
Lots of cats keep claiming
They're married to the game when
I'm clearly the best, man, I'll bury you a lame
You call a woman bitch, I call her by her name
No currency, ironic, ain't a dollar to my name
Pen verses like a wide receiver, I'm going long
Wrote a song so amateur rappers could try to flow along
The weak and the strong, who got it going on?
You're dead wrong

[Hook]
The weak and the strong
Who got it going on?
You're dead wrong
The weak and the strong
Who got it going on?
If you ain't say my name, you're dead wrong
