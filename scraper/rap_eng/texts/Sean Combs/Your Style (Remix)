[Hook: Troy Ave]
She said your new shit pumpin', you make us so proud
We’ve been wantin' something this good for a while
But I’m not fooled by both them dimples on your face
Cause when we danced, I felt that fifth all on yo waist
And you know

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Now all you hear is New York this, New York that
Let's keep it real motherfuckers, I brought New York back
G-Unit in the stu, Dipset too, facts[?]
I even got Ma$e and nine-five Puff on the track
[?] nine-five max
[?]Sneak diss, tweet this no replies you wack
Tables done turned like a DJ gig
Playa' hater, I ain't doin' it big?
Troy, Ave got the streets in a frenzy though
I brought the spotlight back, you should thank me no?
I'm coming up on my first, still on the flow
All my stones flawless? you see me glow
And hears what if [?]
You might get yourself shot, and make me fuck your bitch
Either way I'm bustin' the end of discussion
This the keymix and I'm that nigga, stop fronting

(Hook)
She said your new shit pumpin', you make us so proud
We’ve been wantin' something this good for a while
But I’m not fooled by both them dimples on your face
Cause when we danced, I felt that fifth all on yo waist
And you know

[Verse: Diddy]
You ever made love on a G7?
Told the pilot don't stop till we see heaven
Harlem king with black features
You ever rode on white horses on black beaches
They clear ports we clear portals
Time travel, don't confuse us with mere mortals
You due slippin' we too cool for loose lippin'
Move different, pools on the roof [?] sippin'
Made your life different, blink you might miss it
Even though I hit it first time we kicked it
Who set up plays for you, who coached you in the huddle
Who's penthouse views make the ocean look like a puddle
And I love her cause shorty different
You be [?]
I'm just trying to call you my lady
I have you feeling like Harlem in the eighties

(Hook)
She said your new shit pumpin', you make us so proud
We’ve been wantin' something this good for a while
But I’m not fooled by both them dimples on your face
Cause when we danced, I felt that fifth all on yo waist
And you know

[Verse 3: Ma$e]
Heat rooms like a thermometer
Two-forty on my odometer
I don't trick I pimp I give no gift but stick even on Hanukkah
She ask if I'm faithful, I say, "I promise ya"
If I cheat I'm triple timing ya
Cause Ma$e don't do no welfare
Pay for no health care, that's what you got Obama for
I got my CPs from CP, got my Yeezys from Yeezy
The chick with my umbrella she look like Ri-Ri
You don't believe me, you ask PD
Getting money for me too easy
I feel like Holyfield
I got them Brooklyn broads biting
Already got my cake I'm just here for icing
My nigga Cudda tried to school me to the game
We was balling so much they try to boo us at the game

(Hook)
She said your new shit pumpin', you make us so proud
We’ve been wantin' something this good for a while
But I’m not fooled by both them dimples on your face
Cause when we danced, I felt that fifth all on yo waist
And you know

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Okay, you ain't seen me in a while huh
And that TK went down smelling like some loud huh
Was fucking with your friend I know I did her foul huh
But even still, she'd fuck me now if I allowed her
I get the money and the power too much to resist
Can't even menage with the broad and she take a pic, thirsty bitch
Imma fuck you with a dirty dick
Up the asshole and [?]

[T.I ]
She said your case too complicated before trial
I had her eight more other ladies, you know how

[Verse 4 (cont.): T.I.]
Missionary, doggystyle
No matter how you slice it our destiny's in the writing
Written on the walls you fuck with them other guys and
You can stand to lose it all
I'm talking 90' something Tyson
Get used to [giving that paper up make em] revoke your license


(Pre-Hook)
She said your new shit pumpin', you make us so proud
We’ve been wantin' something this good for a while
But I’m not fooled by both them dimples on your face
Cause when we danced, I felt that fifth all on yo waist
And you know

(Hook)
She like my style, she like my flows
It ain’t no chuck involved, she knows
I came so far from dealin blow
Been on my grind and now it shows
Ain’t nobody round who sound like this
We ain’t the same, they rode that dick
Fuck them lames, get down with this
Pop champagne, girl shake yo hips, hip, hiiips
