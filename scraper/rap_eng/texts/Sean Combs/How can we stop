Oh, oh

1 - How can we stop what we're doing
When it feels so right
Knowing that we're doing wrong
But we still hold on
How can we stop what we're doing
When it feels so right
We can't go on this way
Day after day

A million times I've told myself that I
Would find the words to say, to say goodbye
We can't go on this way
Foolin' around in the night
Girl, loving you is wrong
But I don't wanna be right

Repeat 1

So many times I've had to ask myself why
But reason's aren't enough to keep on living this lie
We both have someone else
So we keeping this thing on the low
I don't wanna loose my love
But I just can't let you go

Repeat 1

Darlin' can't you
(Can't you see)
Can't you see
(What you're doing to me)
What you're doing to me
(Sometimes you make me cry)
You make me cry
(Sometimes you make me laugh)
Yes you make me laugh
(I am so confused)
So confused
(But I don't want to loose)
I don't want to loose
(What we have)
What we have
(What we know but we have to let go)
But we have to let go

Repeat 1

Don't wanna loose your love
Day after day
You know it feels so right, it's right, it's right
We might be doing wrong but we still feel so right
We might be doing wrong, we might be doing wrong
But we still keep holding on
But we can't go on, oh, oh
When I think about how you touch me
Oh, it excites me
(You know it feels so right)
When I think about how you love me
Girl you drive me crazy
(I wanna hold on)
When I think about the times you touch me
Your body invites me
(Oh I can't go on)
Oh I can't go on this way
Day after day
Day after day
Day after day
Day after day
