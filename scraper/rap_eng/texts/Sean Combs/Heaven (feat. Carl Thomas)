(Carl Thomas)
Now that it's over
There's no more use for guns and wars
Costs me a lifetime, just to gain this life's reward
They say streets of gold
Can you imagine somewhere where life will never ends?
No one ever grows old
Oh my brother, please come with me

It's what I live for
A place where love will never cease
Willing to die for
Heaven is where I want to be

(Michelle)
There are instructions that we must follow to a t
In order to reach them
Heaven is where I want to be

They say streets of gold
Can you imagine somewhere where life will never ends?
No one ever grows old
Oh my brother, please come with me

It's what I live for
A place where love will never cease
Willing to die for
Heaven is where I want to be

No more night
There is a place where there'll be no more crying, yeah
And He is Life
Counting those days when we meet in the place

Willing to die for
(Ooh yeah)

It's what I lived for
A place where love will never cease
Willing to die for
Heaven is where I want to be
(I want to be)

It's what I lived for
A place where love will never cease
Willing to die for
Heaven is where I want to be
(I want to be)

It's what I lived for
A place where love will never cease
Willing to die for
Heaven is where I want to be
(I want to be)

It's what I lived for
A place where love will never cease
Willing to die for
Heaven is where I want to be
(I want to be)
