I used to hang out every night
Used to go from club to club
Looking for true love
But now I found that love in you
No longer have to sleep around
'cause I have you, baby

1 - Girl, I'm always thinking about you
And all the things you do for me
Makes me so happy
And girl, when ever you need me
My love is always here for you
Babe, I really wanna be with you

2 - There's so much out there for me
But the only thing I want
Is to be with you
So many places I can be
But the only thing I want
Is to be with you

Baby, I've traveled all around the world
Seen a lot of girls but none
Can compare to you
No matter how far I may go
I'll always know that home is you
And that's where I wanna be

Repeat 1

Repeat 2

3 - Every hour of the day
My thoughts are always of you
You are always in my mind
Can't stand to be apart
Whenever we're not together
It seems like forever
Daydreamin' about you
I really wanna be with you

Repeat 2

Repeat 2

Repeat 3

Repeat 2 until fade
