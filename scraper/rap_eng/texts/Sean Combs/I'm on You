Can I give you one kiss? (uh huh)

Baby just like this (just like this)

Poppin shit with the risk blowin just like this

[Pre-Hook: Dirty Money]

Tryna get fucked up so you won't know
I'm on you baby

[Hook: Timati & Dirty Money]
I need to know
If you gon' be the girl I wife in the morning
Are you gon' leave my heart here broken 'n lonely
And if so I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm on you, I'm on you
Tonight I'm fucked up in the head 'cause I'm on you (I'm on you)
I might get a DUI cause I'm drunk too (I'm drunk too)
Tonight I'm fucked up in the head Cause I'm on you (I'm on you)
Girl I want you (I want you) I'm so on you (I'm so on you)

[Verse 1: Timati]
Sip on that Coco Loso
Relax and let yo' mind go
This bitch here better than a motherfucka
I just gotta be her main lover-lover
Ask my old bitch what she think of her
She said a bitch fly - what you think of her?
Shit, I'mma take her home, I'mma break bread
I'mma be the one who left holding my hand
I'm a wild out, she gon' get gone
Imma keep driving drunk, I'm in love so
She gon get tired, Imma be on fire
Imma look back, I'mma 'member how the song

[Verse 2: P. Diddy]
Lay on my dick
All these hoes wanna leave wit a nigga like me
Li-li-like me
I am the black Russian
We poppin' bottles, we spending cash
It ain't nothing, so bring your friend
Whatcha wanna do now?

[Pre-Hook: Dirty Money]
