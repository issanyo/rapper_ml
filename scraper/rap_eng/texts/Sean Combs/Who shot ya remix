You think someone will give you a wood box when you die? Nah you’ll be surrounded by card board, no lie
You’re fucked once you’re in sight of my eye
Bitch I’ve got brass balls, I’ll go into a knife fight with a grass sword, but it’s you to go night night, able to do fuck all
You can try taking shots at me, but it’s last call, I’m at my last straw, my lyrical jabs knock you out worse than a glass jaw
You think your heavy, I’ll crush like you’re some ants in my hand give you one chance, I’ll kick ass till you’re in a plaster cast
Watch out when abz attacks with rap tracks, so fast it’ll give a man thats manic rapid panic attacks, that facts
The truth is ill never do a truce, pacts get destroyed like the drug addicted youth
Now listen to the stats and the mathematics, I’m savage, it’s a 100% chance I’ll cause mass damage
Hang you in your house attic, with a mouse in your mouth, hung from a halved hammock, filled with mad maggots
Maybe many monstrosity’s and atrocities, committed against you, but I can’t be caught, I did it across the seas
The scenes I’ve seen would cause a heart to freeze, I’ll never stop, the thought has never sailed past that’s id want to cease, desist, resist from pissing me off you bitch, before you cease to exist
