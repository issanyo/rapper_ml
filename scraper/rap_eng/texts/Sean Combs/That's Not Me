[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Said she gave you everything
She broke her back to be what you need
I tried so long to just compete
Can't take no more, losing sight of me
I'm letting you know this can't go on
This one-way street, I'm walking alone
This time I'm breaking free
I'm gonna find me

[Chorus]
I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more, that's it
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be 50/50
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause, baby, that's not me

[Verse 2]
Don't want you to think that I'm selfish
I'm just sick of your one track mess
If you can't meet me halfway
I think it's time that you be on your way
I love you, but I can't baby you
If it's your mama you want, you know just what to do
I looked in the mirror every day
I saw myself fading away
You trying to mold me into her
I loved you so I put you first
But I can't live my life this way

[Chorus]
I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more, that's it
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be 50/50
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause, baby, that's not me

[Verse 3]
I was so lost in love before
I couldn't see the light
But now I'm strong enough to leave you now
So you better treat me right
Don't want to throw it all away
So, baby, here's your last chance
Don't wanna fight with you but I need more of you
Give me all or it's the end

[Chorus]
I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more, that's it (I won't)
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be, I tried)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be 50/50 (No, no, no)
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause, baby, that's not me

[Bridge]
I cooked, I cleaned, I washed your clothes (You know I did)
You were so mean, so ungrateful (So ungrateful)
At night I cried so many times
Tell me how could you go diss me (How could you go diss me)
When you know one day you'll miss me (Know one day you'll miss me)
If it can't be 50/50
Then, baby, that's not me

[Chorus]
I can't sit and be passive (Baby, that's not me)
Won't tolerate no more, that's it (Baby, that's not me)
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be 50/50 (I can't, I won't)
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me (I can't, I won't)
'Cause, baby, that's not me
I can't sit and be passive  (Oh)
Won't tolerate no more, that's it
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be, oh)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be 50/50
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause, baby, that's not me
I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more, that's it
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be 50/50
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause, baby, that's not me

[Outro]
No, no
No, no
