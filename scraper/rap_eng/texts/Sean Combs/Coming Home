(Hook: Alejandro Manzano)
I'm coming home, i'm coming home
Tell the world i'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, i'm coming home
Tell the world that i'm coming

(Verse 1: DeStorm Power)
I said i'm back up in this place
And i'm finally at the front of this race
And i ain't going back
I'ma rip this track so the world should remember my face
I said i'm back up in this place
And i'm finally at the front of this race
And i ain't going back
I'ma rip this track so the world should remember my face

I've been away for awhile
I gave my word when i returned
And i come back with a smile
And i don't come back at all
The world is throwing blows
But i ain't backing off
Everybody claiming they want to grow
But they just slacking off
It took a lot of years to put the hood behind me
The best advice i got was that i had to find me
Another day, another challenge
I never thought i'd see the day i'd be rewarded for my talents

(Hook: Alejandro Manzano)
I'm coming home, i'm coming home
Tell the world i'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, i'm coming home
Tell the world that i'm coming home

(Verse 2: DeStorm Power)
And if you ever call up
And say you fell down
It feels good that i can finally help them all up
I'm doing well now
Let's go to the mall now
We ain't gotta split the bill
I told you i got all us
Came a long way from those ghettos on the east coast
The 7th letter, 6 number, flying high who needs coach
I miss my son up in my arms, miss my homies, miss my mom's
So home cooking with the bomb

(Hook: Alejandro Manzano)
I'm coming home, i'm coming home
Tell the world i'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, i'm coming home
Tell the world that i'm coming home

(Verse 3: DeStorm Power)
This once's for all my people in the struggle
Unemployed or working double shifts
Take your head and lift it in the air
One fist in the air
Reach for the stars, you're almost there
You can't make it, i've been there
You can't take it, i've been there
Given that all the hope is gone
Find something to focus on
You need motivation
That's the reason why we play this song
To let you know you're not out in this world on your own
And the only time you're going back
Is when you're going home

(Hook: Alejandro Manzano)
I'm coming home, i'm coming home
Tell the world i'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, i'm coming home
Tell the world that i'm coming home
