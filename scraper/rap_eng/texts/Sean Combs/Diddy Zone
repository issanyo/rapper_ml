[Chorus: Fergie & Puff Daddy]
Get off the couch, get out your head
(I like this right here, I know you do)
Get off the couch, get out your head
(Ready? I'm ready)
Get in your motherfuckin' Diddy zone and stand
(Talk to 'em)

[Post-Chorus: Fergie]
If you throwing that shade and you hating
You better leave this alone
And if you crying, you whine 'til the night time
You got to leave that shit home

[Verse 1: Fergie & Puff Daddy]
Pay up, pay up, pay up
All you people hit the deck now
I'm 'bout to set that fire, fire, fire
Now watch me stop and drop and roll now
You know I talk that truth (uh huh)
I kinda feel some type of way now (some type of way)
They be forgetting who's who
I'm 'bout to make 'em all remember
Feel me?

[Chorus: Fergie & Puff Daddy]
Get off the couch, get out your head
Get in your motherfuckin' Diddy zone and stand
So turn it up, your evil mode
Go even harder than you never have before (Let's go)
Get off the couch, get out your head
Get in your motherfuckin' Diddy zone and stand
So turn it up, your evil mode
Go even harder than you never have before

[Post-Chorus: Fergie & Puff Daddy]
If you throwing that shade and you hating
You better leave this alone (I like this right here)
And if you crying, you whine 'til the night time
You got to leave that shit home
(Yeah, come on)

[Verse 2: Fergie & Puff Daddy]
Wake up, wake, wake, wake up, hey
I'm off of work and I got something for him to taste
Said wake up, wake, wake, wake up, hey
I'm flying on my bird to the party and I can't be late (Let's go)
Somebody set me off, baby, things were [?]
That zombie on my catwalk tryna interrupt my walking
Was that a cough? Well, that's my fault, then
I bought that block of ice around my neck and made it frozen

[Chorus: Fergie & Puff Daddy]
Get off the couch, get out your head
Get in your motherfuckin' Diddy zone and stand
So turn it up, your evil
Go even harder than you never have before (Let's go)
Get off the couch, get out your head
Get in your motherfuckin' Diddy zone and stand
So turn it up, your evil mode
Go even harder than you never have before

[Post-Chorus: Fergie & Puff Daddy]
If you throwing that shade and you hating
You better leave this alone (I like this right here)
And if you crying, you whine 'til the night time
You got to leave that shit home
(Yeah, come on)

[Bridge: Fergie & Puff Daddy]
I hop up on the couch
Pop a bottle and I do my Diddy dance
When I hop up on the couch
All the boys wanna try to squeeze my ass
Now we poppin' and poppin and poppin', poppin' bottles off
Now we poppin' and poppin and poppin', poppin' bottles off
Now we poppin' and poppin and poppin', poppin' bottles off
Now we poppin' and poppin and poppin', poppin' bottles off
Everybody, everybody say yeah (Turn me up)
Everybody, everybody say yeah (Get loud)

[Chorus: Fergie & Puff Daddy]
Get off the couch, get out your head
Get in your motherfuckin' Diddy zone and stand (That's right)
So turn it up, your evil mode (Talk to 'em
Go even harder than you never have before (I like this right here)
Get off the couch, get out your head
Get in your motherfuckin' Diddy zone and stand
So turn it up, your evil mode (Turn me up)
Go even harder than you never have before
