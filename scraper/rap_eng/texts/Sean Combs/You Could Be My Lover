[Pre-Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Something 'bout you girl, you got me
Just let me love you, girl, don't stop me
Oh, that ass amazing

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Told her "you can't be my girl
But you can be my lover", oh yeah
Told her "you can't be my girl
But you can be my lover", oh yeah
Oh, you could be my lover, girl
Oh, you could be my lover, girl

[Verse 1: Gizzle]
Fuck with me, watch the magic
Keep Chanel on your glasses
Eat the Swiss Alps for breakfast
Sleep with speech, wake up breathless
Mr club man, it's important
Think I left my soul down there
More than the one, man, she's a moment
The Mona Lisa, oh now, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, you've been a bad, bad, bad, bad girl
You're giving me sexy eyes and you break that down
And you bring it right back up
And it's been on my mind for days
And we don't have to say no names
But we can't play, no
Can't play no more games

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Told her "you can't be my girl
But you can be my lover", oh yeah
Told her "you can't be my girl
But you can be my lover", oh yeah
Oh, you could be my lover, girl
Oh, you could be my lover, girl

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy (Ty Dolla $ign)]
Excuse me, beg your pardon?
Fuck with me, girl, I got it
Too much cash in my wallet
I brought drugs to the party
And you like to get lit
Bet you can't do that on the dick
Say it's all real, you legit
You ain't on no fake ass shit
No, no, no, no, no, girl
You've been a bad, bad, bad, bad girl
Giving me sexy eyes when you break it down
And you bring it right back up
And you been on my mind for days
And no, we ain't gon' say no names
But don't play, no
(Don't play no games)

[Pre-Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Something 'bout you girl, you got me

Oh, that ass amazing

Told her "you can't be my girl
But you can be my lover", oh yeah

Oh, you could be my lover, girl

[Bridge/Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, I can be your nigga
But I can't be your man
Baby, just say you're looking for something
That's gon' last, baby
Girl, you better know
Ain't no games
Girl, stop playing with it
Don't make me wait for you, baby
I've got something for you, baby
Oh yeah, I'm ready for you, baby
Cause you've been on my mind for some time now
And I don't know what it is
But girl
Girl, you got me, yeah
