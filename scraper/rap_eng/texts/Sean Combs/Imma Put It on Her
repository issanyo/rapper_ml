She’s on top of me, beneath me is the freeway

[Verse 2: Willie Taylor]
Honey walked up in the club
Dress lookin’ like it’s painted on
I can tell that she ain’t got any panties on
Well, baby that’s the way that I like it, yeah

Just say the word I’ma put it on ya
You can say you touched the president, Cerock Obama
I’m a bad boy and that’s what bad boys do
Black ice, black coop, black cars too
Don’t tattoo my name, tattoo my logo
Let the whole world know you’re fuckin with a mogul
You don’t need a closet
Take you to Taiwan
You can have the whole warehouse, ladies Sean John
And on the 14th I’ll buy the whole island
Name it after Champagne and call it Chris Stylin (Cerock)
I knew that’d have you smilin
Like Day26 I’ll have your ring finger shinin
