[Intro: Puff Daddy]
You feel that
It must be love, yeah
It feels like love
It's Bad Boy, bitch
You know how we do

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Stimulate my heart surrender my mind
Look into my eyes and forever you'll find
A bad boy turned good, how could it be true?
And all through my pain how could it be you?
How could it be new? How could it be my cheatin' ways through?
How could it be it's me in pursuit about to get a white suit
About to get a night job just to keep my mind grounded in you
And all that jazz, what else can make a nigga spend all his cash?
A chick with a face, a chick with a little skinny waist
A chick with a mind that match her nice taste
Plus I got the mind to snatch you like weight
Why you wanna tie me up like Rick James?
Reverse the Porsche as long you got them little high heels on
It's on, it's on

[Verse 2: Cassie]
This is somethin' I never wanted but since I met you I've been on it
I think about you all the time, can't get you off my mind
(I know this can't be love) I know this can't be love
(But baby it must be love) But baby it must be love, oh
Thinkin' I'm going all the way, I wanna show you but I'm afraid
I know you say it's all on me, maybe tonight I'll let you see
(I know this can't be love) I know this must be love
(But baby it must be love) I know it must be love

[Hook: Cassie]
Don't wanna give in to you so easily
But I can't even fight it, you make me so weak
And I can't understand what you're doin' to me
But I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)

[Verse 3: Cassie]
I heard you whisper somethin' to me
Hold me close now, baby don't leave
Emotions taking over, somethin's controllin' me
(I know this can't be love) I know this can't be love
(But baby it must be love) But baby it must be love
What am I feelin', it's gettin' stronger
And I can't hold it back for much longer
Although we try to be cool, it's all because of you
(I know this can't be love) I know this must be love
(But baby it must be love) Baby it must be love

[Hook: Cassie]
Don't wanna give in to you so easily (so easily)
But I can't even fight it, you make me so weak
And I can't understand what you're doin' to me
But I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)

[Verse 4: Puff Daddy & Cassie]
Nah, in a minute I might have to check myself into the psych ward
I'm goin' crazy and I don't know what I'm fightin' for (Hmm)
Seems too easy to run from this
And my mind's sayin' I can't really fuck with this
Try to resist but (Ooh) every passionate kiss blow my mind like a terrorist
You can be mine on some forever shit (On some forever shit?)
I'm intrigued, believe me
Try to be tough but the look in your face is so delicate (Ooh)
It's somethin' you doin', you got me in a trance
You got me ruing and doing shit I ain't used to doin'
Thinkin' 'bout a chance, maybe a slow dance (Yea)
Maybe we hold hands, fur coats in France (Keep going)
Go diving on beaches with white diamonds in the sand
Then we hang gliding over Cannes
And you can be my number one fan
And I could be your love in the club for as long as the song lasts
Talk to 'em, Cass

[Bridge: Cassie]
The way you make me feel got me goin' crazy
Tell me what you doin' tonight
I'll be there right away, take a ride with you, home late
Ohh, and you know I'm gonna give you my love
Boy I'm so glad that you're mine, you're all mine
Do you wanna spend some time with me?

[Hook: Cassie]
Don't wanna give in to you so easily (Don't wanna give in)
(Don't wanna fight it) But I can't even fight it
(You make me so weak) You make me so weak
(I can't deny it) And I can't understand what you doin' to me
(Yes, I like it) But I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)

Don't wanna give in to you so easily (Don't wanna give in)
(Don't wanna fight it) But I can't even fight it
(You make me so weak) You make me so weak
(I can't deny it) And I can't understand what you doin' to me
(Yes, I like it) But I like it (I like it), I like it (I like it)
