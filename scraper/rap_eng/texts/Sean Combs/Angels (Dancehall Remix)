[Verse Two: Diddy]
Came from heaven just to sing a song for you...
To the rhythm of my love for you, and now it's beatin slow
And you know, this the ennnnd of the road
When I sing that slow song for you...
And love was nothin but another gun for you ('nother gun for you..)
And I would hide it in my helpless soul
I'm not afraid to go down the road where we go
I don't know, you can hear 'em callin, don't you?
When the angels call like..

[Chorus: Diddy]
YOOOOOOOO-HOOO~!
If you don't wanna stay you can GOOOOO-OHH...
It seems love don't live here no morrre...
The angels are flyin so loooow, singin to you ...

[Verse Three: Diddy] (*Serani)
Yeah! My nigga Chris asked me why?
I said fuck 'em playa fly
Damn fever got me high (So high)
When my nigga left I died
I mean cryin deep inside (*NO NO!!!) (Can you feel me?)
But the angels helped me fly (*NO NO!!!) (Let's fly)
Aiyyo.........hey BIG, talk to 'em man

[Verse Four: Notorious B.I.G. - verse taken from "My Downfall"]
Ain't no shook hands in Brook-land
Army fatigue -my fatigue, the enemies
Look man, you wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crotched up over the casket, screamin BASTARD
Cryin, know my friends is lyin
Y'all know who killed 'em filled 'em with the lugars from they Rugers
Or they Desert, dyin ain't the shit but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggas bring the riot

[Chorus: Dirty Money]
YOOOOOOOO-HOOO!
If you don't wanna stay you can GOOOOO-OHH...
It seems love don't live here no morrre...
The angels are flyin so loooow, singin to you
(Don't you hear me callin you?)
He's the one you love... ('cause I hear 'em callin me...)
And he's the one you trust... (...like our time is almost through)
Time is runnin out (There's nothin left to do)
When they're callin you...
When the angels call like.. (I answeeeeer)
