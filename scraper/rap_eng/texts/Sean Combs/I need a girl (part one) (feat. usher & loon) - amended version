Yeah, come on
I need a, I want a...

I need a girl, to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl, to make my wife
I need a girl, who's mine, all mine
I need a girl, in my life

Yo, I'm Internationally known, on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife, at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone, but
Chicks that romance, don't tickle my fancy
Boning, Tiffany, Nancy, that's not what my plans be
Need a girl, that can stand me, raise me a family
Go from trips to DeLancy, to trips to the Grammy's, cause
Most of these girls, be confusing me, I don't know, if they
Really love me
Or they using me, maybe it's the money, or maybe you ain't
Used to me
Cause you was depressed, and now, you abusin' me
That's why, I need me a girl, that be true to me
Know bout' the game, and know how it do to me
Without a girl, on my side, shit'll ruin me
Forget the world, girl it's you and me, now let's ride!

I need a girl, to ride, ride, ride (ride wit' me)

(Oh' ride, right here wit' me)
I need a girl, to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl, to be my wife
(I need a girl, that makes me feel so good, inside)
Nobody else, she's all mine
I need a girl, in my life

Yo, yo, I done met a lot of women, in my lifetime
But see, it's not a lot of women, that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks, wit' all the right features
And hood-rat chicks, that only rock sneakers
Cell-phones and beepers, and know how to treat ya'
You break her heart, she'll walk out, and leave ya'
I find a girl, I'm a keep her, cause know I'm getting money
And the game getting deeper, yo' on some real shit
I need somebody, I can chill wit', I need somebody, I can
Build wit'
I need somebody, I can hold tight, wintertime, and the
Full-length's
Snow-white, anytime, we together, feels so right
You the girl, I been looking for, my whole life
God blessed me, I'm glad I got the insight
Because of you girl, now I understand life, I need a girl!
