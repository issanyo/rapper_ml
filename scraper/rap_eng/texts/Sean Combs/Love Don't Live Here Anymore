[Chorus: Faith Evans]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore (oh no)
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore (no no)

[Verse 1: Faith Evans]
When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed that right away

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
You've abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore (oh no no)
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore (oh no, oh no)

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Love dont live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories of
What we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay, another home

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
You've abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore (no no, no)
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore (oh, oh)

[Verse 3: Faith Evans]
Through the windows of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness
Inside of me
Why'd you have to go away?
Don't you know I miss you so
I need your love

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
You've abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore (oh, oh)
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore (oh, oh, oh, oh)
You've abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore (oh, oh)
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore (oh, oh)

[Outro]
Love don't love here
Love don't live here anymore
Love don't live here
Love don't live here anymore
Love don't love here
Love don't live here anymore
Love don't live here
Love don't live here anymore
