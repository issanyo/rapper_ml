Come on y'all let's get free, you feel me? (I might give up)
You see I've seen a lot of things
Seen people come and go,seen people die
Seen people hurt and cry...
See cause life is a journey
And in this journey I'm learning to love me
So I can get free, you feel me? (I might give out)
Free, I just wanna be free...(I might give out)
I wanna be free
Free from all the things that tear me down, (I wanna be free)
Free from all the lies the stress and doubt, (I wanna be free)
Free from all the bondage and captivity, (I wanna be free)
Free from always being my own worst enemy, (I wanna be free)
It will never be easy for you and me
Never be easy, never be easy (i might give out)
Painful answers unless we don't want to be free
We all want to be free
We all want to be free
I want to be free
I want to be free
