Hello there this is Jim Johnson
And I'm here at the Harriet Tubman
Underground railroad elementary school
Today we have rap star, entrepreneur
Puff Daddy coming in to talk to the kids today

But right now I have three young kids
Right here to let it know
Why they love Puff Daddy so much

Lil' Becki can you please tell us
Why you love Puff Daddy?
I don't really like Puffy
But my other sister does

Lil' John boy can you please tell us
Why you love Puff Daddy?
Cause he wears a lot of fly clothes
He very, very smart and he goes to my school

Last but not least Shameka Johnson
Can you please tell us why you love Puff Daddy?
Because he's a hit making, money having
Bentley driving mother fucking pimp
