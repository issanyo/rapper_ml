[Verse 1: King Combs]
Mami I keep you hot, baguettes flooded with ice
Have the envious chicks sick one in the light
I'm not the regular type, I'm living the life
And you say you got a man he ain't loving you right
Fly nigga with the juice like Sunny Delight
Take a couple hundreds and flights
Maybachs covered in white
Got what you need ain't no need for stress
And when you need to dress, got a stylish just to keep you fresh
All those diamonds VVS
Keep you laced in all white so they see you blessed
I rock Dolce Gabbana and Gucci too
And if you don't believe me ask Groovy Lew
Take a dip by the pool with you I never lose
Out in Malibu do things you never do
Hit the Mondrian toasting Sangria
She here when I need her, that's my Senorita

[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
Mami ven aqui
I wanna be your papi chulo can't you see? (mi amor)
Baby I need you conmigo
Your style is my steelo te necesito aqui
(te necesito yo a ti, te amo)
Baby come to me
Baby come to me

[Verse 2: King Combs]
So I put you on game show you how a boss move
Taught you how to move so they can never cross you
Yeah the niggas try to impress you, but they can never get you showed you life the first day I met you
You probably never pictured a life like this
Put you in Wraith with the lights like this
Had you in the furs and I iced the wrist
Come on girl who else gon do you like Chris?
And believe me sweetie I got enough to feed the greedy
You said you need me when you see me on the TV
Come here girl you know you can't leave me
Take you overseas now you speaking Swahili
And I ain't gotta flex for you, private the jet for you
Go to Cancun relieve stress for you
Tell em the stories and they probably won't believe ya
She here when I need her, that's my Senorita

[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
Mami ven aqui
I wanna be your papi chulo can't you see? (mi amor)
Baby I need you conmigo
Your style is my steelo te necesito aqui
(te necesito yo a ti, te amo)
Baby come to me
Baby come to me
