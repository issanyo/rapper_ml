[Chorus: Problem]
I'm so disrespectful (What?)
How I pulled up was so disrespectful, I know (Yeah, I know)
This is so disrespectful (What?)

[Verse 1: Problem]
Hellcat hot as the devil (Let's go), God
It's life in this music (Real life, dawg)
Ridin' 'round in Park for amusement (Ooh, what?)
I'm so disrespectful (Let me know then)
That was so, that was so disrespectful (On God)
Way I do hoes, it's so disrespectful (On God)
The way I move loads, it's so disrespectful (On God)
The way I change up
Used to play up to where we only gettin' lay-ups
Woo, it's so disrespectful
Woo, I'm so disrespectful
Been the nigga, how y'all get so forgetful? That's crazy (That's crazy)
Y'all so disrespectful (Yup, yup)
Y'all so, man, y'all so disrespectful (What?)

[Chorus: Problem]
I'm so disrespectful, I'm so disrespectful
How I pulled up was so disrespectful, I know
This is so disrespectful (What?)

[Post-Chorus: Problem & Puff Daddy]
Yeah, let's have some fun (Look)
Can I play? Yeah
(I'm feelin' so disrespectful)

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
King shit, Martin Luther vibes
The shit I lived make Martin Luther cry
Crossin' the god'll get you crucified
The rich homie that never forgets the Biggie lines (Bad Boy)
(That's so disrespectful)
Disrespectful, took ballin' to new levels
Game time, let's play, boy, no Hugh Hefner
Baby girl, take a jet with a giant
Fuck one team, I'm finna buy the Jets and the Giants
Yankees and the Mets, the Knicks and the Nets
Let her bathe in CÎROC, now she drippin' in success
It's wavy like King Combs' fade
Never brush off what ex-cons made (You niggas see it)
Yeah, you need rockets to fly past me
Slick with my tongue, ask Cassie
Sippin' DeLeón out my damn Grammies
Still the king of New York, motherfucker

[Chorus: Problem]
So disrespectful, I'm so disrespectful
How I pulled up was so disrespectful, I know
This is so disrespectful (What?)
Yeah, look

[Outro: Puff Daddy & Problem]
This is the time that we been waitin' for
We live
I'm feelin' so disrespectful
Peace
You understand?
It's a motherfuckin' piece
But besides that, we gon' keep motherfuckin' showin' out on y'all niggas
Bein' in front row at the motherfuckin' fights
Motherfuckin' LeBron comin' to LA
Nigga, oh man, we in this motherfucker
We gon' live our best motherfuckin' life, bitch
Motherfuckers, you see it, you see it
You see it in its living flesh, motherfucker
