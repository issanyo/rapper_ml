Uh-huh, yeah...Uh-huh, yeah...Uh-huh, yeah...Uh-huh
Uh-huh, yeah...Uh-huh, yeah...Uh-huh, yeah...Uh-huh, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby, we can try again
If you're ready
Baby, we can take it slow
If you're ready

[Verse 1: Bobby Brown]
I've been around
You know the things I used to do, uh huh
Girl, I never thought
Never thought I'd find someone like you, baby
Girl, I need you in my life

[Chorus]
Baby, we can try again
If you're ready
Baby, we can take it slow
(We can take it slow)
If you're ready

[Verse 2: Ralph Tresvant]
If you were mine
All the things of yesterday are no more
They're all gone
And I can say with a love like yours
What more would I need?
Girl, I need you in my life

[Chorus]
Baby, we can try again
If you're ready
Baby, we can take it slow
If you're ready

[Bridge: Bobby]
Oh, I'm waiting for someone like you
To love me, to hold me (hold me)
To care for me
Like no other

[Chorus]
Baby, we can try again
If you're ready
Baby, we can take it slow
If you're ready

Baby, we can try again
If you're ready
Baby we can take it slow
If you're ready

Baby, we can try again
If you're ready
Baby we can take it slow
If you're ready

Baby, we can try again
If you're ready
Baby, we can take it slow
If you're ready

Baby, we can try again
If you're ready
Baby, we can take it slow
If you're ready
