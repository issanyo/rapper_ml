[Spoken: Busta Rhymes]
Yes, yes yes yes yes
Fresh from the LONS family tree in 1992
This is Busta Rhymes, spelled with a ‘A’
As I will carry you on a journey of overwhelming listening pleasure
Hip hop oriented essence, some real emotional like you know
And little emotional thing and I just like feel it, pop shit
The shit that’s like real raw deal like this
You know what I’m sayin?
Just gotta bust like, you it’s like
It gets me into one of them moods where I just be like I’m like
Hey Busta Rhymes be rippin’ it, you know that I be flippin’ it
Every time I relax my mind I’m shittin’ on it
Alright alright alright, chill, chill
Relax, and I’mma slow down and I’mma carry on with what I’m supposed to be dealin’ with here
Anyways, it’s like this
It is now the time that you face the certified quality
In musical, spiritual, definitely physical
So just chill, you know what I’m sayin’ and relax like a little bit
And just capture the complete emotional of Mary J. Blige
If you think I’m bullshitting, stay tuned and relax and listen
Cause you ‘bout to see in a split second
So just chill and like check it out cause I’m gonna wild and do it like this and like that
I flip on the rhymes yo indeeded Busta Rhymes be wyldin’
Oh shit damn I’m bustin’ like breaking fools
Can’t help this shit
Slow down and like relax and hold my composure and
Y’all just cool out and listen to the album
Check out this shit new, raw deal
Rugged Mary J. Blige material
