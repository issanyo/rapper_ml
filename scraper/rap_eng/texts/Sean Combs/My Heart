Sneak the sandals and beach with sand, booze
Weeks of gamble and the sheets are bamboo
Got me misery but my man telling me
Seen by the pool, coolest pink lemonade
Leather poncho plus the belt's four yards
I'm so sharp, I could cut myself
Invite the morning, we could get it on
If not, I'm oh so cold like Omarion
Cold night chills, fall in your own nature
Hard to feel booze in, no mixture
Just some red that the Feds won't discuss
Gold egg with your adventure
I'm in the cut so I'm in the truck
And you might wanna know who's up in the phonebook
I'm busy 'cause you know it's off the hook

That it's off the hook
That it's off the hook
That it's off the hook
That it's off the hook
That it's off the hook
That it's off the hook
That it's off the hook
That it's off the ...

My heart
I'm scared
My heart, my heart, my heart
I'm scared, oh Lord, are you there?

My heart
I'm scared
My heart, my heart, my heart
I'm scared, oh Lord, are you there?

My heart
I'm scared
My heart, my heart, my heart
I'm scared, oh Lord, are you there?

My heart
I'm scared
My heart, my heart, my heart
I'm scared, oh Lord, are you there?
