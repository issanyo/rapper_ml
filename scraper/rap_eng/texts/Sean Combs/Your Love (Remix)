[Intro: Trey Songz]
Yeah, come here

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I gotta certain hand in purchasin’ automobiles
Watch a hundred karats this what an Audmer is
Walk up in the spot and we the trillest niggas in here
Grab her by her arms, suck her neck 'til she surrenderin’
Is it him? Valet the BM
Not a baller, but ballin' above the rim
Still blowin' money fast, Boston George, countin' money
Chick finer than Wylona, so I let her count it for me
She got a nice bubble when she rockin' Robin jeans
Smokin' all the loud, but the neighbors can hear us scream
Blew a milli in a club, next day we made five
Smokin' on a jet, they bill your card with the fine
Never mind, Dirty Money ballin' on another planet
If I bought another Coupe, you niggas couldn't stand it
MC Hammer in the flesh, 357
Baby girl a thug, she use her pussy as a weapon

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Girl, I want you face down first thing when I wake up
Already got you covered girl ain't no need for make-up
I just need a camera and someone to tape us
Internet ain't ready for the way that we gon' make love
Got me fiendin' right now, girl, I need you right now
Tryna hold back but you can get it
Don't tease me right now, baby, please me right now
Girl, scream yes if you with it

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Got, got-got, got-got one question, one question for you
When I'm goin' through withdrawals tell me what I'm 'sposed to do
'Cause I need your love, I want your love
Girl, it ain't the same if I ain't got your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
All I want is you baby, all I want is you baby
All I really want is you, your touch, your sex is my drug
All I want is you babe, only one is you baby

[Verse 3: Dirty Money]
I'ma put it in yo' face boy as soon as you wake up
I know you wanna hit it, want me to be your little slut
If you do it good, boy I'll return the favor
Baby, I'm tired of the bed I wanna try it on the table
Boy, I fiendin' right now, boy, I need you right now
Come a-come a, come a little closer you can get it
Don't tease me right now, better please me right now
Let your tongue walk on this pussy

[Hook: Dirty Money & Trey Songz]
Got, got-got, got-got one question, one question for you
When I'm goin' through withdrawals tell me what I'm 'sposed to do
'Cause I need your love, I want your love
Boy, it ain't the same if I ain't got your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
All I want is you baby, all I want is you baby
All I really want is you, your touch, your sex is my drug
All I want is you babe, only one is you baby

[Verse 4: Diddy]
Bitch you know I'm Diddy hoe, real deally-o
Real estate in the states, spillin' in Philly yo
I did it for the team, I did it for you shorty
I did it for the fam, I did it for the glory
Cocky nigga still half cockin' my Yankee fitted
My wrists Rocky, Sylvester Stallone, Jacob did it
Early birds, furry furs
His and hers, baby girl, silver spurs
You know I stay on my grind and she be right there
The shit I'm doin' won't be seen or done for light years
Talkin' me and you, the world is ours
All we need is our love, money, and the power
Talk to 'em

[Outro: Dirty Money & Trey Songz]
My love, my love, your love, your love)
Your sex, your sex, is my drug, is my drug
Boy I need your body here tonight
I ain't leavin' this club without your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
All I really want is your love
Oh, oh
Love, yeah
