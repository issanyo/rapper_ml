"(Chorus)
Everyday
Everyday it rains (cause things will never be the same)
It will never be the same
Everyday it rains
Things will never change cause I am not the one to blame

How can I try to make you understand?
That I only living the lie
Cause I have to walk around everyday with out a smile
Everyday it rains (cause things will never be the same)
It will never be the same
Everyday it rains
Things will never change cause I am not the one to blame

Waking every morning knowing your not there
Is the only thing that keeps me scared?
All I do is think of you and all the love we shared
Everyday
It keeps on raining in my life it rains
And Everyday is the same
Baby you brighten up my life
You brighten up my life
So realize
Let it rain on me

Everyday it rains and rains
Things will never be the same
Everyday it rains Things will never change cause
I am not the one to blame
I am not the one to blame just because it rains everyday
Oohhhh
Oh oh
Everyday it rains
Things will never change cause I am not the one to blame

I am not the one to blame
Believe me when I say it that it rains everyday
Got a cloud over me all the time
And I don't know why it rains; it rains and rains
Waking every morning knowing your not there
Is the only thing that keeps me scared?
I don't know when your coming home
But I'll be waiting with open arms
Believe me when it rains it rains for real
Things will never change for I am not the one to blame
