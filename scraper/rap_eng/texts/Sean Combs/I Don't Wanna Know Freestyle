[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
How you with another man? How you gon' go out and kiss another man?
Lingerie on, lights out you strip for that other man (but)
But I'm a pimp, so I can't let you get the upper hand I'm like naw
Telling me you with another guy I'm like naw
Telling me he slide you the pipe I'm like naw
Cause I don't show affection while he keeps it wet still
He cops you La Perla, I take you to Wet Seal
I chill with the [Griffins], that [?] you still don't feel different
So he must be real ill liquored but he don't dig deep with the real deal rhythm
But you lose me I hope you look real ill with him (no)
But I don't want to know where y'all go or what y'all do
Or where y'all at because then I'll be calling with the heater like, "Where y'all at?!"
And he don't dare want that but I care come back

[Verse 2: Mario Winans]
Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself

[Hook: Mario Winans]
I don't wanna know
If your playin me, keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if your creepin, please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know

[Verse 3: Mario Winans]
Oh baby
I think about it when I hold you
When lookin in your eyes, I can't believe
I don't need to know the truth
Baby keep it to yourself

[Hook: Mario Winans]

[Bridge: Mario Winans]
Did he touch you better than me? (touch you better then me)
Did he watch you fall asleep? (watch you fall asleep)
Did you show him all those things, you used to do to me (do to me baby)
If your better off that way (better off that way)
There ain't more that I can say (more that I can say)
Just go on and do your thing and don't come back to me
(Stay away from me baby)

[Verse 4: P. Diddy]
I don't wanna know where your whereabouts or how you movin
I know when you in the house or when you cruisin
It's been proven, my love you abusin
I can't understand, how a man got you choosin (yeah)
Undecided, I came and provided ma
My undivided, you came and denied it (why?)
Don't even try it, I know when you lyin (I know when you lyin)
Don't even do that, I know why you cryin (stop cryin)
I'm not applyin no pressure, just wanna let you know
That I don't wanna let you go (I don't wanna let you go)
And I don't wanna let you leave
Can't say I didn't let you breathe
Gave you extra cheese (c'mon), put you in the SUV
You wanted ice so I made you freeze
Made you hot like the West Indies (that's right)
Now it's time you invest in me
Cause if not then it's best you leave
Holla, yeah
