Oh, oh...

[Chorus]
Falling in love, falling in love again
Falling in love again with you
Falling in love, falling in love again
Falling in love again with you

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I think about you
And I remember all the things we went through
And I realize that I need you
I've fallen so in love with you, oh

[Chorus]
Falling in love, falling in love again
Falling in love again with you
Falling in love, falling in love again
Falling in love again with you

[Verse 2]
Oh, it's funny how things change
Not long ago, I thought my love for you would fade away
Your love gets sweeter every day
So in love with you, I want to stay, so baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Promise that you'll stay
Never take your love away
'Cause I need your love
You're stuck in my heart
Don't you know
And the feeling is strong
And I can't let you go
(I can't let you go)

[Chorus]
Falling in love, falling in love again
Falling in love again with you
Falling in love, falling in love again
Falling in love again with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Promise that you'll stay
Never take your love away
(Don't take your love away from me)
'Cause I need your love
You're stuck in my heart
Don't you know
And the feeling is strong
And I can't let you go
(I can't let you go)

[Chorus]
Falling in love, falling in love again
Falling in love again with you
Falling in love, falling in love again
Falling in love again with you

[Bridge]
I'm all that you want and more
I just want to close the door
And share my love, and share my love
I just want to be with you
Show you that my love is true
What you don't see, believe in me

[Chorus]
Falling in love, falling in love again
Falling in love again with you
Falling in love, falling in love again
Falling in love again with you
Falling in love, falling in love again
Falling in love again with you
Falling in love, falling in love again
Falling in love again with you
