Oooh...
I'm the only woman you need

I'm the only woman you need
Only one you need take me
Don't be a fool like you have me
If you want to be happy
I'm the only woman you need
All you have to do is trust me
Never have to be sad again
Cause I'll always be your friend

I gave my heart to you
What more can I do
To show you how much I care
About you and all the little things you do
But see all I ask is that you make me feel like
I'm somebody
All day, all day, everyday, give your lovin' away
Whoa...
Baby, can't you see
If we should part
That all my days of loving you
You know they weren't that hard
That's why I'm saying I gotta be strong

I'm the only woman you need
Only one you need take me
Don't be a fool like you have me
If you want to be happy
I'm the only woman you need
All you have to do is trust me
Never have to be sad again
Cause I'll always be your friend

I know that I was wrong
For all that carryin' on
But are you gonna hold this
Against me for life
You know all I wanted to do is be your wife
And make you happy

I'm the only woman you need
Only one you need take me
Don't be a fool like you have me
If you want to be happy
I'm the only woman you need
All you have to do is trust me
Never have to be sad again
Cause I'll always be your friend

If you really don't want me (want me)
I wish you'd let me know
And I will go so far away
I can not stay
If you don't want me to, I can
Be a fool for you no more (I don't think so)

You see I tried
Tried to please you
The best way I know how
And I never decieved you
If only we could trust each other
Stop thinking foolish things
I don't want another lover

I'm the only woman you need
Only one you need take me
Don't be a fool like you have me
If you want to be happy
I'm the only woman you need
All you have to do is trust me
Never have to be sad again
Cause I'll always be your friend
