(Poncho) Verse 1: (0:00:22 – 0:01:07) [Hunter]
To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow my body to reflect on the bathroom mirror
I got the body that Mariah wants to see every night
Cus in the back of the Palace, [the back of Palace] Bangin the ladies; up in Dallas
The Palace is for mackin the ladies up in Dallas
The women twerkin, shakin it, and the music blastin, but I just can't quit
Dance with, and ride on “The Blazin Express”
Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot
Now check it, I got more Mack than Dad in the land
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Dens
C-notes by the layers, true to life players
Jump in the ride; come over
Tell your friends jump in the Blazin Express, and enjoy the ride cus

(Hunter) Chorus: (0:01:07 – 0:01:29) [Poncho]
I love it when you call me Big Poncho

(Poncho) Verse 2: (0:01:30 – 0:02:15) [Hunter]
Yea; Straight up honey really I know
Most of them think they mackin but they actin
Who they attractin with that line, "What's your name, what's your sign"?
Soon as he hit that grind I go creep up from behind
And I ask why do you like and what you want
To do with me; just to make you laugh
What's ur number now
We gon' be here for a while, call all my crew
And take a ride on “The Blazin Express”
And throw the keys to Joelee please
Let's head up to [Poncho's Palace]
And we can go live, [via satellite]
Let's eat at Golden Coral and head to Pekings
Talk and Dance for a while, cause in a while we gonna do it
We gonna do what's right; ain't that right
In the jacuzzi, a with dat booty cus
