Baby don't, don't go
You know I need you so
Sometimes my pride gets in the way
I say things that I don't mean when I think your hurting me
I love you more and more each day, each day

I didn't, I didn't mean to make you cry
I don't want, I don't want you to say goodbye
I didn't, I didn't mean to make you sad
Your the best love I ever had
And nothin', and nothin' goin' to tear us apart
And for this, and for this love we work so hard
And can we, can we try to work it out
I'm yours all yours with out a doubt

I know that living wit me can sometimes be unhappy but I really need you in my life, yeah
Cause every part of me you totaly complete
Remember to make me your wife? Please and...

I didn't, I didn't mean to make you cry
I don't want, I don't want you to say goodbye
I didn't, I didn't mean to make you sad
Your the best love I ever had
And nothin', and nothin' goin' to tear us apart
And for this, and for this love we work so hard
And can we, can we try to work it out
I'm yours all yours with out a doubt

I didn't, I didn't mean to make you cry
I don't want, I don't want you to say goodbye
I didn't, I didn't mean to make you sad
Your the best love I ever had
And nothin', and nothin' goin' to tear us apart
And for this, and for this love we work so hard
And can we, can we try to work it out
I'm yours all yours with out a doubt

I didn't, I didn't mean to make you cry
I don't want, I don't want you to say goodbye
I didn't, I didn't mean to make you sad
Your the best love I ever had
And nothin', and nothin' goin' to tear us apart
And for this, and for this love we work so hard
And can we, can we try to work it out
I'm yours all yours with out a doubt
