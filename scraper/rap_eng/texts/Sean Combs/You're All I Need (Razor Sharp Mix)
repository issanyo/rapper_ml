[Intro: Mary J. Blige]
Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
You're all I need
To get by, by
You're all I need
To get by, by

[Verse One]
Shorty I'm there for you anytime you need me
For real girl, it's me in your world, believe me
Nothing make a man feel better than a woman
Queen with a crown that be down for whatever
There are few things that's forever, my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nothing
You made a brother feel like he was something
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no fronting
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say, baby it'll be okay
Now that's real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my pussy away and keep it tight aight
And I'mma walk these dogs so we can live
In a fat ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'mma make sure we
Be living in the fuckin lap of luxury
I'm realizing that you didn't have to fuck wit me
But you did, now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
I got a love jonz for your body and your skin tone
Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got the good shit at home
Even if I'm locked up North you in the world
Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showing your stuff off, boo
It be true me for you that's how it is
I can be your knower, you can be my wis'
Then I can be your Sun, you can be my Earth
Resurrect the god through birth
Best believe

[Hook 2]
You're all that I need, I'll be there for you
If you keep it real with me, I'll keep it real with you
Loving your whole steez, it be in there boo
On top of that you got the good power-U
