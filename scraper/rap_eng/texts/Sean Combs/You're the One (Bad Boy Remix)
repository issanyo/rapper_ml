You're the one for me
You're the one for me (You're the one for me)
You're the one for me
You're the one for me (You're the one for me)

Busta Rhymes and SWV
Puff Daddy Remix one time blowin your mind
(And you don't stop)
(Remix)

[SWV]
I know that you are someone elses guy
But these feelings that I have for you I can't deny
She doesn't treat you the way you want her to
So come on, stop fronting
I wanna get with you

What your girl don't know won't hurt her
Anything to make this love go further
You're the one

You're the one for me
When in need (You can call on me)
When in love (That's all I want us to be)
But you're the one
You're the one for me

This can be an undercover romance
Cause I feel that I'm the kind of girl you should give a chance
Taste an see (Taste and see)
How good it can be (How good it can be)
Cause you don't have to worry baby

What your girl don't know won't hurt her
Anything to make this love go further
You're the one

You're the one for me
When in need (You can call on me)
When in love (That's all I want us to be)
But you're the one
You're the one for me
You're the one for me
When in need (You can call on me)
When in love (That's all I want us to be)
But you're the one
You're the one for me

What's my chance
I'm willing to do anything to you
In your hands
You don't have to worry at all
Say a thing, and if she finds out
I don't know nothing
(Check it out)

[Busta Rhymes]
Yo, and if you ain't the bangest chick I ever saw
Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya, Ya
From the ceiling to the floor
I look from top to bottom
Analyse the middle of your little cleavage and your drawers
Everything remains raw baby
I love the way you strut
When you walk by got a wide angle lens focused on your butt
Perplex your looks make me black and polish
Caramel, city, stacking bone now I'm walking tippy toe-ish
Amazing Leanne got my heart pumping
Whole entire body cocked on diesel like we running track or something
I knew that you were the one for me
Word is bond on Flipmode and SWV
Got the oppurtunity
To see how sutible and beautiful you can be
When you do your nails and your cuticles
Just stay sharp lord, word on my son
Let it manifest for sure that you're the one

You're the one for me
When in need (You can call on me)
When in love (That's all I want us to be)
But you're the one
You're the one for me
You're the one for me
When in need (You can call on me)
When in love (That's all I want us to be)
But you're the one
You're the one for me
You're the one for me
You can call on me
That's all I want us to be
But you're the one
You're the one for me
