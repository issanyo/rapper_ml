[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Yes love, love your fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy, that's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whipping
Welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant
I'm slamming niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
Cause mom dukes ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking angel dust
When I bust my gat, mothafuckas take dirt naps
I'm all that, and a dime sack, where the paper at?

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G., Puff Daddy]
BIg up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
Big up, big up, it's a stickup
BIg up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
Big up, big up, it's a stickup
