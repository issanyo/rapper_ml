Hook:
Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me down
And I'm sittin' here, with this blank expression
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child

Diddy:

I know you can hear me
I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
God please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am

Verse 1: Keyshia Cole
If I told you once, I told you twice
You can see it in my eyes
I'm all cried out, with nothing to say
You're everything I want it to be
If you could only see, your heart belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours I'll be
Baby won't you come and take this pain away?

Hook:
Last night
I couldn't even get an answer
You said you couldn't get an answer baby
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me down
Why would you disturb me baby
And I'm sittin' here, with this blank expression
I can't read your mind baby
The way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child

Verse 2: Keyshia Cole
I need you, and you need me
This is so plain to see
And I will never let you go
And I will always love you so, I will
If you could only see
Your heart belongs to me
I love you so much
I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free
Forever yours I'll be
Baby won't you come and take this pain away

Last night
Oh last night
I couldn't even get an answer
Oh baby what you wanna do to me
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me down
Why wouldn't you disturb me baby
And I'm sitting here, with this blank expression
That's not true baby, no no
The way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child
I'm so alone, I'm so lonely baby

Hook:
Tell me what, there is to say
To make you come back, and break me like that

And if it matters
I'd rather stay home
With you I'm never alone
Don't wanna wait till your gone
Dont ever leave me
Just don't leave me

Hook:
Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
Couldn't get an answer baby
Oh
I tried to call
Call me baby
But my pride wouldn't let me down
Why couldn't you just dial me baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby?
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression
Don't sit there, no
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child
I'm so alone, I'm so lonely baby

Verse 3:
I need you, and you need me
This is so plain to see
And I will never let you go
And I will always love you so, I will
If you could only see
Your heart belongs to me
I love you so much
I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free
Forever yours I'll be
Baby won't you come and take my pain away

Hook:
Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
I could of need you baby
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me down
Why couldn't you just dial me baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby?
And I'm sittin' here, with this blank expression
Don't sit there, No
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child
I'm so alone, I'm so lonely

Verse 3:
Why don't you pick up the phone
And dial up my number
And call me, up baby
I'm waiting on you
Why don't you pick up the phone
And dial up my number
Just call me, up baby
I'm waiting on you

P. Diddy talking
Hello, yeah wassup
I been trying to reach you all night
That s*** ain't funny not picking up the f***in' phone
You gotta f***in' stop playing with a n**** feelings like that
You know how much I love you right
For those couple of seconds though
When I couldn't get in touch with you
I was ready to come over to your house and shoot that muthaf***er up
Dumb bitch you better not f**king be there when I get home (laughing) that's really how it go right
