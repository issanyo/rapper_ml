Verse 1: Charlie Clips
Look, Nick get 'em an Oscar they only act hard
Till there's a big hearse parked right in their backyard
That's what they get for tryna f with the black squad
We copped guns and credit it to the black card
Yeah, we back now let your men know
We don't deal with little guns neither we do extendos
Back of the phone ain't the only place where the sim go
Shootin at ya dog like Duck Hunt from Nintendo
Steve Jobs I bring the Macs out
Hospital gown, I see you with ya back out
It's dollars all in my trap house
You won't find one Penny there like it's Shaq house
A lot of people don't like me
It's fish scale, every night like I sleep with a Pisces
I don't play fair, go ahead send your people to fight me
Then they get the side texts (techs) like I'm cheatin' on wifey
You know ya gun small when they make the pow sound
I shoot it uptown they hear that shi* downtown
You like the way your heart beat I do you wild foul
And get Con to cut the beat like it's WildStyle
Here's a couple things you never knew
Headshot to ya little man and he never grew
You ain't on my level a different pedestal
Don't believe me ask Nick this was incredible

Verse 2: Conceited
Its always easy to tell em' you know the hoods mine
I'm never easy to read, how could you book mine
You don't gather the cash and you don't push lines
Wouldn't have a penny to burn if it was good times
Ill raid ya shi*
And ill take ya chips
You better put the locks on like "jadakiss"
If i dont cut em and kill em with the blade and shi* Glock pill then i pop will like jaden smith
We ain't the same you make it rain i make it flood
A couple ends i rub it in like vaporub
I really hate a scrub thats real timid
Your pockets got a dollar bill in it like "playersclub"
Im feelin dry though and im spittin hot flow
When i light the mic like "vitiligo"
Ya'll go to ya'll house to get ya'll semi
Minor be with a Ni**a like R. Kelly
Now its over wait... you just overweight
Shit ill kill a Ni**a if its over weight
You know im holding cake
Dont make her wet with the jewels then
I will with the shoes thats rollerskates
You keep your broad tight put her in the cozy place
I play my cards right bet you i can poke her face
Ill let the pound graze ya
Stomach shots hit your abs if it will cut your ribbon half like the town mayor

Verse 3: Nick Cannon
Ni**a get up out my comments with that f**kboy shi*
And keep my name out your mouth with them f**kboy lips
And i keep this thing out yo mama so i can f**k more chicks, your sisters, your cousins, your wife and your side bi**h. Get the family discount to ride on my dick
Yo i like old bi**hes know when to go bi**hes
18 years old still play in the snow bi**hes
Intelligence the dumber then dumber them slow bi**hes
Giving head at the meet and greet after the show bi**hes
Its making no difference im f**king them golddiggers
Rocking diamond shoes, a turban with gold zippers
Call me mike jackson the cannon is so thriller
Young ike turn up

My chains like murder know im about to kill em
Black squad get em in my backyard chillin
What more can I say we top billin
Penthouse living Ni**a I bought buildings
F**k trump towers incredibles on the cieling
Edibles kicking in she lickin on my d*ck again
Finger on the button youngin been about them benjamins
Credible at the cannon with a capital muf**kin "N"
HaHa.. yo "hitman" bring it in

Verse 4: Hitman Holla
Its all about the benjamins baby.. believe it
They ain't seen a talent like mine since jesus
I stay with it married to the "K" yeezus
Bad bi**hes and they only goal is to please us
Me and nick side by side horse power
Penthouse in las vegas north tower
Touch you anywhere i got flexible range
And your new deal ain't worth my incredible chain
Im a baby momma still wife split at divorce
Im doing 240 tell the cops meet me in court
Spanish harlem i got all kinda chicks in new york
Snakes and pigs i got to stay away from the pork
A young Ni**a in his prime living life to the fullest
Strap now i dont play its only right that i pull it
Boy im blocked in
Man im so saint louis
I might try to bring back the lock in
Box cutters will leave you boxed in
Im too talented before i started rapping i was top 10
Ask around yea they all know hit
Nowadays im hard to find on some waldo shi*
I watched pops treat my momma like a queen a real gentleman
This why i do the same shi* to cinnamon
Still got the bird on my timberland love of my life
If you ain't never been through it man f**k your advice
Putting on for my city and the set that i claim
Hitman its incredible gang
Yea
