[Intro: Ron G.]
Yes indeed once again
For those who don't know
What the sounds of the youngest DJ in charge
Ron G
I wanna say whassup to Mary
And this that uptown classic

Give it to 'em
Take 'em uptown to the Polo Ground
Take 'em uptown to the Polo Ground
Take 'em uptown to the Polo Ground
Take 'em uptown to the Polo Ground

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize
I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone
To satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration
Be the real love that I need

[Chorus]
Real love
I'm searching for the real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love
I'm searching for a real love

[Verse 2]
Oh when I met you I just knew
That you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration
Lead me towards a real love

[Chorus]

Look up in the sky
It's a bird, it's a plane

So what's it gonna be?
The real one, the fake one
Ya need a minute to think for whom ya better take
What up? My time is up
Peace out to brooklyn
Helpin' Daddy-O, hey yo, bring the verse in

[Verse 4: Mary J. Blige]
So I try my best and pray to God
He'd send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me
Towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful
I can be your all and all
And give you good lovin' through the summertime
Winter, spring and fall

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Mary J. Blige]
You see I'm searching for a real love
And I don't know where to go
I've been around the world and high and low
And still will never know
How it feels to have a real love
Cuz it seems there's none around
I gotta end it in this way
Because seems he can't be found

[Chorus: Repeat Until Fade]

[Puffy: Outro]
It's that flavor
That's what I'm talking about
Ain't no other way to explain it
