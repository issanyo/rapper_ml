Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
I tried to call but my pride wouldn't let me dial
And I'm sittin' here with this blank expression
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child

I know you can hear me
I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
God, please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am

If I told you once, I told you twice
You can see it in my eyes
I'm all cried out with nothin' to say
You're everything I want it to be

If you could only see, your heart belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearnin' for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away?

Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
You said you couldn't get an answer, baby
I tried to call but my pride wouldn't let me dial
But that should never stop you
And I'm sittin' here with this blank expression
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child

I need you and you need me
This is so plain to see
And I would never let you go
And I will always love you so, I will

If you could only see, your heart belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearnin' for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away?

Last night, couldn't even get an answer
Oh, baby, what you wanna do me?
I tried to call but my pride wouldn't let me dial
Why wouldn't you just dial me, baby?

And I'm sitting here with this blank expression
Don't say anything, baby, no, no
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child
I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby

Tell me what words to say
To make you come back and break me like that
And if it matters, I'd rather stay home
With you, I'm never alone
Don't wanna wait 'til you go
Whatever you do, just don't leave me

Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
Couldn't even answer, baby
I tried to call but my pride wouldn't let me dial
Why couldn't you just dial me, baby?

And I'm sitting here with this blank expression
Don't say a thing, no
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child
I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby

I need you and you need me
This is so plain to see
And I would never let you go
And I will always love you so, I will

If you could only see, your heart belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearnin' for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take my pain away?

Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
I couldn't answer, baby
I tried to call but my pride wouldn't let me dial
Why couldn't you just dial me, baby, baby, baby?

And I'm sitting here with this blank expression
Don't say a thing, no
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child
I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby

Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number
And call me, my baby? I'm waitin' on you
Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number?
Just call me up, baby, I'm waitin' on you
