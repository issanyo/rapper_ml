Can you feel me?
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it

Let's play a game, let's pretend for a second
You don't know who I am or what I do
Let's just put it to the side
I can feel your heart beating, I can hear you breathing
Look into your eyes, trying to see into your mind

See into your soul, no limits to the levels me and you can go
When it's me, I take control
But it's something about you that makes me wanna change
I like the way you dancing and the way you play the game

I like the way you take away the pain
The way you tell me that you want it, not saying a thing
The way you got me going, got me going outta my brain
I see us going at it, going in and outta them lanes

I don't want your innocence, I don't want you to stutter
I don't want a commitment and I don't want you to suffer
I don't want your number, baby, I want you to wonder
I want you to come up looking like there’s something you wanna

Tell me
What you thinking about when you got me waiting patiently
And usually, I don't have to wait for nobody
But there's something about you that really got me feeling weak
And I'm trying to find the words to speak

Boy, I got my eyes on you
So tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning

I don't even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
I'm hoping that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it

I know you're gonna like it
So tell me how you want it
And you don't have to fight it
‘Cause baby you're invited, yeah

I know you're gonna like it
So tell me how you want it
And you don't have to fight it
‘Cause baby you're invited

Your dreams fulfilled, you're rocking with the best
Unforgivable I’ma put your limits to the test
You're pulsating, your heart is beating outta your chest
You're hyperventilating, you’re trying to catch your breath

(Don't stop)
I'm the first, I'm the next, I'm the end
I'm the force in your thoughts, that'll make your mind bend
Look how I approached you, look how I expose you
Look how I done studied every move, now I know you

I don't wanna control you, I wanna console you
And do everything that I told you
Get high with me, come touch the sky with me
Fly with me, see life with new eyes with me

(Don't stop)
I'm the dream, I'm the one, I'm the reason you come
I'm a king, I'm a hung, I'm a beast
I'm the last thing your eyes see, the passion's inside me
It's yours, now come try me, c'mon

Tell me
What you thinking about when your hands is all on me
‘Cause I've been thinking about all the possibilities
Ain't no other place that I really wanna be
‘Cause you swept me off my feet, ooh

Boy, I got my eyes on you
So tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning

I don't even know your name
Boy, I need to know your name
I'm hoping that you feel the same
Tell me if you want it

I know you're gonna like it
So tell me how you want it
And you don't have to fight it
‘Cause baby you're invited, yeah

I know you're gonna like it
So tell me how you want it
And you don't have to fight it
‘Cause baby you're invited

I got a selection of positions, affection
With no kisses, so tell me
Tell me how you want it, tell me how you want it babe
I got a selection of positions, affection
With no kisses, so tell me
Tell me how you want it, tell me how you want it babe

Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
Do that sh**, do that sh**, do it
