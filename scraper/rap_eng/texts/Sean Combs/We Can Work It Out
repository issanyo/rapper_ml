[Chorus]
Baby, we can work it out
Don't wanna fight
Let's make it right
Baby, we can work it out
Don't wanna fight
Let's make it right

[Verse 1]
Things ain't going smooth right now
But I know we can make it
We've got to get through this somehow
If we let it all fade away
We'll both be in pain
'Cause I know we still care

[Chorus]
Baby, we can work it out
Don't wanna fight
Let's make it right
Baby, we can work it out
Don't wanna fight
Let's make it right

[Verse 2]
Even though we both made mistakes
Our love stayed strong
As if nothing was wrong
You're everything I've always dreamed of
I can't let you go, baby, you ought to know

[Bridge]
We know we're in love
So why don't we just take the time to get it right
I'll always be here for you (just for you, baby)
I just need you by my side

[Chorus]
Baby, we can work it out
Don't wanna fight
Let's make it right
Baby, we can work it out
Don't wanna fight
Let's make it right (we gotta make it right)
Baby, we can work it out
Don't wanna fight
Let's make it right
Baby, we can work it out
Don't wanna fight
Let's make it right
Baby, we can work it out
Don't wanna fight
Let's make it right
Baby, we can work it out
Don't wanna fight
Let's make it right
(we can make it right, we can make it right)
Baby, we can work it out
Don't wanna fight
Let's make it right
Baby, we can work it out
Don't wanna fight
Let's make it right
