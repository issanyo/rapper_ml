In the middle of the night you hold me tight
Said it's alright I'm yours forever
I do what you want if you don't hurt me
I'll cook and clean I'll make you happy

Ooh what you do to me
Ooh you're my everything
Ooh I'm so glad I found you
Ooh I can't live without you

Got a jones in my bones and it's all for you babe
Can't leave your arm I'm so addicted
I can't see a thang it's the sweetest thang
So who's your girl you better say my name

Ooh what you do to me
Ooh you're my everything
Ooh I'm so glad I found you
Ooh I can't live without you

What you do to me it's just a mystery
It's hard to believe that you are here with me
Making all my dreams a sweet reality
All my life I tried to find what's best for me

Ooh what you do to me
Ooh you're my everything
Ooh I'm so glad I found you
Ooh I can't live without you

Ooh what you do to me
Ooh you're my everything
Ooh I'm so glad I found you
Ooh I can't live without you

Ooh what you do to me
Ooh you're my everything
Ooh I'm so glad I found you
Ooh I can't live without you

What you do to me it's just a mystery
It's hard to believe that you are here with me
Making all my dreams a sweet reality
All my life I tried to find what's best for me

Ooh what you do to me
Ooh you're my everything
Ooh I'm so glad I found you
Ooh I can't live without you
