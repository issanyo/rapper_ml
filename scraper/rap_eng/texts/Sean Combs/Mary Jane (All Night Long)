[Verse 1]
Baby, not tonight
I don't wanna fuss and fight
I just wanna make it right
There's work to do
I wanna get real close to you
I wanna get you in the mood
All the things you want to do
Just relax and I'll take care of you
And anytime you want me
I'm sayin' that I love you every day
And I know that you love me, baby admit it

[Chorus]
Give me all your love and don't stop
My love's waiting when you reach the top
(All night long)
Come into my bedroom honey
What I got will make you spend money
(All night long)

[Verse 2]
You know that I know that you love me
So if you just give me a chance, I can still show you romance
I know that you still savin' for my flavor babe
So stop playin' hard to get, let's make love like we first met
All the things you want to do
Just relax and I'll take care of you
And anytime you want me
I'm sayin' that I love you everyday
And I know that you love me, baby admit it

[Chorus]
Give me all your love and don't stop
My love's waiting when you reach the top
(All night long)
Come into my bedroom honey
What I got will make you spend money
(All night long)
