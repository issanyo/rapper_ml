To every man and woman who doesn't know
The true meaning of a bad girl
I'm here to let you know all about it

A bad girl is the best thing that could ever happen
To a bad boy

A bad girl defies the world around her
And plays only by her rules

A bad girl is an independent female
Who can depend on no one but herself

A bad girl is one who knows what she wants
And knows how to get it

A bad girl is never part of the in crowd
But always has her own crowd

A bad girl gives respect
So therefore she gets just that in return
But if not, she can and will kick your ass

And that's the true, full blown reason
Why I'm a bad girl, and i'ma stay bad
And I'm bad for life
