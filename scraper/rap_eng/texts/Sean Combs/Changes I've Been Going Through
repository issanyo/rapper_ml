[Chorus 1]
Can’t you see what I’ve been doing through cause I wanna be with you
Changes I’ve been going through cause I wanna be with you

[Verse 1]
It’s all gone the moment that we shard is gone away
Maybe it’s better that we didn’t stay together
Seems like we’ve gone through this a thousand times
Baby I still don’t have the answer
Why can you tell me why we couldn’t be together?

[Chorus 2]
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
Baby don’t you wanna be with me?
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
Baby don’t you wanna be with me?

[Verse 2]
See I didn’t want to ever want to cry
But still I need love and affection
Was it that hard for you to show me some attention?
Tell me baby did I push you away?
Was I coming on strong for you?
Why can’t you tell me, tell me what am I to do?

[Chorus 2]

[Interlude]

[Chorus 1: (4x)]

[Outro]
So why can’t ya see, pretty baby can’t you see
That I wanna be with you
