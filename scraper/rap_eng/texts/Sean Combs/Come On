[Chorus]
Do you really wanna rock tonight
Come on come on come on come on
And if you feel that the vibe is right
Come on come on come on come on
Say you really wanna get your
Body on tonight (Come On)
We can dance if you wanna dance
All night come on come on

[Verse 1: Nathan & Wanya]
We can clear that floor tonight
And so much more tonight
I'm feeling so good
Wanna dance the night away, with you
Hey D.J. play my song
Wanna party all night long
If you feel what I'm feeling
Don't be scared to join in
Come on

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna rock tonight
Come on come on come on come on
And if you feel that the vibe is right
Come on come on come on come on
Say you really wanna get your
Body on tonight (Come On)
We can dance if you wanna dance
All night come on come on

[Verse 2: Shawn & Wanya]
Girl I've been peeping you
And you've been peeping me
Baby let's not waste anymore time
('Cause I know you want to)
Got real close to me
'Cause we felt so easy
The way you move your body
Looks so fine, fine (You got me hypnotized)
The way you look into my eyes
And how you wear your hair
And oh the stylish clothes you wear
When you walked in the room
I knew that it was on
And I hope that this feeling
Goes on and on, come on

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna rock tonight
Come on come on come on come on
And if you feel that the vibe is right
Come on come on come on come on
Say you really wanna get your
Body on tonight (Come On)
We can dance if you wanna dance
All night come on come on

[Bridge]
If you wanna dance
Come and take a chance
If you wanna dance with me
Do you wanna move
I can make you move
Do you wanna move with me, with me

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna rock tonight
Come on come on come on come on
And if you feel that the vibe is right
Come on come on come on come on
Say you really wanna get your
Body on tonight (Come On)
We can dance if you wanna dance
All night come on come on
