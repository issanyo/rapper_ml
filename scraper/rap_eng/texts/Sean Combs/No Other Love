[Chorus]
No other love, I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
No other love, I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure

[Verse 1]
Pretty little baby, you have given me good times
And all I wanna do is make it better
I could never tell you that I didn't love you now
Because no other love can compare to you

[Chorus]
No other love, I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
No other love, I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure

[Verse 2]
This is something I, I must confess
You're the only lover who can love me like no other
There's only one man who can give me what I need
You've got me going crazy
Baby, give you're lovin' to me

[Pre-Chorus]
If only you could see that you are all I need
I can't walk away, boy, I can't walk away

[Chorus]
No other love, I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
(can measure up to your love)
No other love, I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
No other love, I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
(measure up to your love, baby)
No other love, I'm thinkin' of
(I'm going crazy because of your love)
No other love can measure

[Outro]
Baby, it's only you I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
Baby, it's only you I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
Baby, it's only you I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
Baby, it's only you I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
Baby, it's only you I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
Baby, it's only you I'm thinkin' of
No other love can measure
