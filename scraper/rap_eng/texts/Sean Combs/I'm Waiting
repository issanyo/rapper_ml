[Intro]
Ah, haha, yeah, ye-yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You're afraid but give it time
There's got to be something you like
Love letters but no replies
Boy, you've got to know what you want

[Pre-Chorus]
From the way you look at me
Friends checking me (Oh)
Always whispering
Never confront me (Oh-oh-oh)
Think that I'm gonna let you know
That's no time for playing no more

[Chorus]
Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me?
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting
Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me?
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting

[Verse 2]
It's okay, don't be shy
Because you might find love in the first try
Now you know I can't read your mind
You got to let me know what you want

[Pre-Chorus]
From the way you look at me
Friends checking me (Friends checking me)
Always whispering
Never confront me (Confront me)
Think that I'm going to let you know
That's no time for playing no more

[Chorus]
Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me?
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting
Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me?
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting

[Bridge]
I don't know why you would have to hide the way you feel (Hide the way you feel)
Listen to your heart and don't deny that this is real (Deny that this is real)
You know you really want to be here in my arms, holding me
So tell that you want me like I want you (What are you gonna do?)
Yeah, ha, uh, ha

[Chorus]
Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me?
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting
Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me?
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting
Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me?
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting
Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me?
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting
Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me?
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting
Even though you got me wondering
