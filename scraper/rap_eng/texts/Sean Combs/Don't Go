[Intro: Mary]
Baby don't go
Baby don't go
Baby don't go

[Chorus: Mary]
Don't leave me, leave me, leave me
(Don't go, don't go)
Don't leave me, leave me, leave me
(I love you so)
Don't leave me, leave me, leave me
(Don't go, don't go)
Don't leave me, leave me, leave me
(I love you so)

[Verse 1: Mary]
I've been hurt before, stayed around for a while
Let's work it out
Let's try to make it happen
Don't do the things that other guys did
To hurt me
They made me cry
Break my heart, oh why?

[Hook: Mary]
I know you're a busy man
But you don't understand
How it feels to be alone
When times get hard and
I want to feel your
Sweet and tender touch
That's all I'm asking baby
Cause I never asked for much
Oh, ohhh

[Chorus: Mary]
Don't leave me, leave me, leave me
(Don't go, don't go)
Don't leave me, leave me, leave me
(I love you so)
Don't leave me, leave me, leave me
(Don't go, don't go)
Don't leave me, leave me, leave me
(I love you so)

[Verse 2: Mary]
This may be a fantasy
That I dream of baby
Time and time again
I knew that we would be
More than friends
I gave you my heart
And all of my time
But now you're actin shady
Is it all in my mind?

[Hook: Mary]
I know you're a busy man
But you don't understand
How it feels to be alone
When times get hard and
I want to feel your
Sweet and tender touch
That's all I'm asking baby
Cause I never asked for much
Oh, ohhh

[Chorus: Mary]
Don't leave me, leave me, leave me
(Don't go, don't go)
Don't leave me, leave me, leave me
(I love you so)
Don't leave me, leave me, leave me
(Don't go, don't go)
Don't leave me, leave me, leave me
(I love you so)


[Bridge: Mary]
Don't leave, don't leave
Don't leave me alone
I wanna be with you
Oh, oh, oh, Mmm, yeah oh oh oh
I wanna be with you
Yes I do, yes I do

[Outro: Mary](2x)
You've got my heart boy (you've got my heart)
You are the only one (Oh, you're the only, only one)
If I can't be with you (if I can't be)
I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do)

You've got my heart boy (you've got my heart)
You are the only one (Oh, you're the only, only one)
If I can't be with you (if I can't be)
I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do)
You've got my heart

You've got my heart  (3x)
