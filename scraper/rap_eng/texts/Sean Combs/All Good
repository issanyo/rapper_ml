[Intro: Sample]
"Yeah, this album is dedicated, to all the teachers who told me
I'd never amount to nothing
For all the people who lived above the buildings
That I was hustling from, that called the police on me
It's all good, baby baby
'Cause I went from the negative to the positive
And it's all"

[Chorus]
Good times like J.J. and them
It was G.O.O.D Music like Kanye and them
It was Goodfellas like Henry and them
But nowadays good girls, ain't too many of them
So if you a good girl, let me see your hands
Let these niggas know, every chance that you can
If you got that good good
Shorty, please raise your hand
You know its all good, you just need a good man
If you smokin' good-good, nigga pass it to your man
'Cause when you at your lowest gettin' higher is the plan
Got somethin' in my cup, feel good to be the man
And if its good money, tell em' to put it in my hand

[Verse 1]
I'm talking good dudes, good vibes and some good food
Smokin' good with a playlist full of good grooves
You know the shit you like to hear, like good news
A couple Megan Goods came through, made the hood move
In slow motion for me
She be frontin' like "Why all this commotion for me?"
They talk about her shit, like they doing promotion for it
But she single, 'cause they never show devotion for it
She ain't never act too good for a nigga
But she losing faith, she don't see no good in these niggas
She like why I get treated bad, but be good to a nigga
You do bad, you lose, too bad, good for you nigga, it was

[Chorus]
Good times like J.J. and them
It was G.O.O.D Music like Kanye and them
It was Goodfellas like Henry and them
But nowadays good girls, ain't too many of them
So if you a good girl, let me see your hands
Let these niggas know, every chance that you can
If you got that good good
Shorty, please raise your hand
You know its all good, you just need a good man
If you smokin' good-good, nigga pass it to your man
'Cause when you at your lowest gettin' higher is the plan
Got somethin' in my cup, feel good to be the man
And if its good money, tell em' to put it in my hand

[Verse 2]
Shootin' Cee-lo with my Goodie Mob
Yellin' that I fall better, life is a gamble
I was good luck for the betters
Take a risk nigga, you gotta shoot to miss, nigga
Time is golden, like that Rollie on your wrist, nigga
I hate when they gets figures, then disfigured
And when niggas get salty thinkin' that shit's sugar
That's when good goes bad
That's when niggas who just came home, could go back
So let's keep the vibe right, keep the energy good
Them boys'll sit you down player like a injury would
Them my niggas fuck with me, before the industry would
Riding 'til the wheels fall off and the engine no good, it was

[Chorus]
Good times like J.J. and them
It was G.O.O.D Music like Kanye and them
It was Goodfellas like Henry and them
But nowadays good girls, ain't too many of them
So if you a good girl, let me see your hands
Let these niggas know, every chance that you can
If you got that good good
Shorty, please raise your hand
You know its all good, she just need a good man
If you smokin' good-good, nigga pass it to your man
'Cause when you at your lowest gettin' higher is the plan
Got somethin' in my cup, feel good to be the man
And if its good money, tell em' to put it in my hand
