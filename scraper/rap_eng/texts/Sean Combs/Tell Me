Intro by puff daddy:
I like that
That's right
We gon' smooth it out a little bit
For all you players out there
And we gonna sex it up a little bit
For all you lovers out there

Verse one:
Every woman wants a man
Who can satisfy her desires
But you can't understand
That you got me waiting for your love
And I need to hear the word from you

Chorus:
Tell me what you want me to do
'cause baby I'm waiting
Waiting for an answer from you
Tell me what you want me to do
'cos baby I'm waiting
Gotta hear a word from you baby

Verse two:
Baby, I'm not afraid
To speak from my heart to you

What I feel is so true
Take me, embrace me
Don't keep me waiting for you
Give me your loving

Repeat chorus

Break:
Gotta tell you how I feel
Love so good it seems unreal
Really need your love right now
Make it work somehow
So won't you tell me what I gotta do babe
I really really need your love
Tell me what you want me to do
Can't get enough of your loving
Can't get enough of the things you do
Can't get enough of your loving
Can't get enough of the things you do

Repeat chorus to fade

Tell me boy what you want me to do
'cause baby I'm so in love with you
(repeat to fade)
