Last night
I couldn't even get an answer
Tried to call
But my pride wouldn't let me dial
And I'm sitting here
With this blank expression
And the way I feel
I wanna curl up like a child

I know you can hear me
I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
God please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am

If I told you once, I told you twice
You can see it in my eyes
I'm all cried out
With nothing to say
You're everything I wanted to be
If you could only see
Your heart belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free
Forever yours I'll be
Baby won't you come and take this pain awayyyyy

Last night
I couldn't even get an answer
Tried to call
But my pride wouldn't let me dial
And I'm sitting here
With this blank expression
And the way I feel
I wanna curl up like a child

I need you
And you need me
This is so plain to see
And I will never let you go and
I will always love you so
I will...
If you could only see
Your heart belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free
Forever yours I'll be
Baby won't you come and take this pain awayyyyy

Last night
I couldn't even get an answer
Tried to call
But my pride wouldn't let me dial
And I'm sitting here
With this blank expression
And the way I feel
I wanna curl up like a child

Tell me the words to say
To make you come back
And work me like that
And if it matters I'll rather stay home
With you I'm never alone
Don't want to wait till you're gone
Let me be, just don't leave me

Last night
I couldn't even get an answer
Tried to call

With this blank expression
And the way I feel
I wanna curl up like a child

I need you
And you need me
This is so plain to see
And I will never let you go and
I will always love you so
I will...
If you could only see
Your heart belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free
Forever yours I'll be
Baby won't you come and take my pain awayyyyy

Last night

I'm so alone I'm soooo lonely

Why don't you pick the phone
And dial up my number
And call me a baby
I'm waiting on you

Why don't you pick the phone
And dial up my number
Just call me a baby
I'm waiting on you

[Phone dialing and ringing]
[Diddy:]
Hello
Hey waz-up
I've been tryin' to reach you all night
That shit ain't funny not picking up the mutha fucking phone
Better stop fucking playing with a nigga's feelings like that
You know how much I love you though right?
But for them couple of seconds though
When I couldn't get in touch with you
I'm ready to come over your house and shoot that mutha fucker up
You better fucking not be there when I get over that house
[laughing]
That's really how it goes down right?
