La di da da da
La la la la la, la la la, la la

Ooh
(My life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine)

[Chorus:]
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(My life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine)

[Verse 1:]
Life can be only what you make it
When you're feelin' down, you should never fake it
Say what's on your mind and you'll find in time
That all the negative energy
It will all decease
And you'll be at peace with yourself
You won't really need no one else
Except for the man up above
Because he'll give you love
(My life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine)
If you looked into my life...

[Chorus:]
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(Oh you will see I'm so blue)
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(Down and out, crying everyday, don't know what to do or to say)
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(If you looked into my life)
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(My life, my life, my life, my life)

[Verse 2:]
Take your time
Baby, don't you rush a thing
Don't you know, I know we all are struggling
I know it is hard but we will get far
And if you don't believe in me
Just believe in He
'Cause he'll give you peace of mind (yes he would)
And you will see the sunshine (for real, yes you would)
And you'll get to free your mind
And things will turn out fine
Oh, I know that things will turn out fine
Yes they would, yes they would
(My life, my life, my life, my life)

[Break:]
Ohh, I gotta go through the fire, embrace the flame
Let it burn real deep, can't skip over the pain
I gotta break through
Hey, yeah, I gotta break through
I'm recognizing the man in the mirror was me
That was hurting myself in reality
I had to break through
Oh, I had to break through

You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm talkin' bout gettin' it together
I'm talkin' about dealing with the pressure
I'm talkin' about letting it burn
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, let it burn now
(My life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine)

[Chorus:]
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(If you looked into my la la la la)
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(La la la la la la la la la)
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(I had to let it burn y'all, let it burn, y'all, let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, let it...)
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(Let it burn, let it burn)
(My life, my life, my life, my life)

My life is just like your life
All the time
