If I was your girlfriend
Would you remember
To tell me all the things you forgot
If I was your man

If I was your best friend
Would you let me
Take care of you
Do all the things that only your best friend can
Oh oh oh

If I was your girlfriend
Would you let me dress ya
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
Not that you're helpless
But sometimes
Sometimes those are the things that being in love's about

If I was your one and only friend
Would you run to me
If somebody hurt you
Even if that somebody was me
Yeah yeah ooh
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
Please, yeah
Oh oh
