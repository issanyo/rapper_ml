Once upon a time, a prince asked a beautiful princess "Will you marry me?" The princess said no, and the prince lived happily ever after. And he rode motorcycles and fucked skinny, big-titted broads, and hunted and fished whenever the fuck he wanted, and went to naked bars, and dated women half his age, and drank whiskey, beer, Captain Morgan, and snorted cocaine off strippers' asses, and never heard bitching, and never paid child support or alimony. And ate pussies and ass-fucked cheerleaders and kept his house and guns, and never got cheated on while he was at work, and all his friends and family thought he was fucking cool as hell, and he had tons of money in the bank, and he left the toilet seat up

The End
