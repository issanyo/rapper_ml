We do it for fun
We just do it for fun
Dirty E.A.T, we do it for fun
Bad Boy (Nelly, Diddy, Murphy Lee)
We do it for fun (This is history baby)
Bend them trucks, we do it for fun (haha)
Stack them bucks, we do it for fun (Come on now)
And the band played on (yea)
Just like (I believe you cool to this)
We do it for fun
If you see me ma it's on

Come here girl, what your name is?
Where you from? Turn around, who you came with?
Is that your ass or your momma have reindeer?
I can't explain it but damn sure glad you came here
I'm still a sucker for cornrows, you know I never changed that
Your body is banging mamma, but where your brains at?
I'm still the same cat when I was young I was running with bad boys
But now I'm older hope they saw I'm running with bad boys
Here come another man, unlike no other man
Candy coated whoa! Switching in every lane
Ya'll help me, why don't cha please help me
Eighth girl this week and it's only Tuesday
I like the cocky bow legged ones
Like white and Dominicans, hispanics and Asians
Please shake it for Nelly son
Manolos Ma-no-no's I can't tell
Everybody and their hootchies
When you do it do it well

[Chorus]
Let me see you take it low (girl go and take it low)
We can even do it slow (we can even do it slow)
Either way you want to go (either way you want to go)
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something move something, shake ya tail feather
Girl go and take it low
We can even do it slow (we can even do it slow)
Either way you want to go (either way you want to go)
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something move something, shake ya tail feather

Now real girls get down on the floor (on the floor)
Now get that money honey act like you know (like you know)
Mama I like how you dance, the way you fit in them pants (Uh)
Enter the floor (Uh) take it low (Uh) girl do it again (Uh)
You know I love that (I love that)
Now where them girls at? (Where the girls at?)
It's Diddy, Murphy Lee, and Nelly how you love that? (Shit uh ohhhhhh)
Come on, we got another one player
From New York to the Dirty how they loving it player?
Baby you impressive let's get
To know each other
You the best of the best and
You got to love it in the dresses, the sexiest
I had to tell her she's a young Janet Jackson live in living color
Look here momma you're dead wrong for having them pants on
Capri's cut low so when you shake it I see you're thong
My pocket's full of dough shake your feathers till the morning
It's Bad Boy and Nelly man somebody better warn them

[Chorus]
Oh no I heard them bad boys coming
Can't stop now
Got to continue my running (yea)
'Cause we go party till them lights come on
And then my song start fucking 'cause my mic still on

Yo, I'm the big booty type
I like them thick with their mind right (Awe)
Banging personality conversate when the time right (Naw)
I'm not hard I've got women to handle that
They be like he the man when I'm really a Thundercat
Come on you know the tics connect like Voltron
Collect so much grass popo thinking we mow lawns
My gohans don't match that
But it matches her head wrap and the seats that I got in the 'Lac
I'm just a juvenile
'Cause I be about G's
Keep the women wheezy man, they say they have my babies
I'm young like Turk, I like the cash and the money (I'ma eat my money)
Man, I'm that damn hungry
See I'm starving like Marvin girl
I've got sixteen bars of fire (is what I'm starting)
Plus my rats come in packs like Sammy and Dean Martin
And I got so many keys you'd think I was valet parking

[Chorus]
Oh no I heard them bad boys coming
Can't stop now
Got to continue my running (yea)
'Cause we go party till them lights come on
And then my song start fucking 'cause my mic still on

Let me see you shake ya tail feather

[Repeat: x2]
Girl go and take it low
We can even do it slow (we can even do it slow)
Either way you want to go (either way you want to go)
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something move something, shake ya tail feather
