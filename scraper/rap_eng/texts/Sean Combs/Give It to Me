[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Yeah, I like the way this is goin' down
Check it
Just soak up sultry

[Chorus]
See, I can't give up on the way that you give it to me
Give it to me
No, I can't give up on the way that you give me your love
See, I can't give up on the way that you give it to me
Give it to me
No, I can't give up on the way that you give me your love

[Verse 1]
I been wondering how you can make it better
For me to give you all of my love
And open up the door to my heart (baby, baby)
But I don't understand your way of thinkin'
Can't help the way I feel down inside
The love I feel for you I can't hide

[Chorus]
See, I can't give up on the way that you give it to me
Give it to me
No, I can't give up on the way that you give me your love
See, I can't give up on the way that you give it to me
Give it to me
No, I can't give up on the way that you give me your love

[Verse 2]
You don't know what you doin' to me
I can't explain the way you make me feel
Your pulse is running high
And it's so real (real love)
Every day and the way that you give it to me
Give it to me
All the love I need
And baby, I hope you never leave

[Bridge]
All your love is all I need
Baby, don't take your love from me
(Your love is) your love is so good
(Keep on givin' to me)
Every day and every way (oh baby)
Baby, don't take your love away from me
Your love is so good, baby

[Chorus]
See, I can't give up on the way that you give it to me
Give it to me
No, I can't give up on the way that you give me your love
See, I can't give up on the way that you give it to me
Give it to me
No, I can't give up on the way that you give me your love
(You dont know what you doin' to me)
See, I can't give up on the way that you give it to me
Give it to me (Can't give up on the way...)
No, I can't give up on the way that you give me your love
See, I can't give up on the way that you give it to me
Give it to me (Don't you take it away)
No, I can't give up on the way that you give me your love
(Baby, it's so real, the way you make me feel)
See, I can't give up on the way that you give it to me
Give it to me
No, I can't give up on the way that you give me your love
See, I can't give up on the way that you give it to me
Give it to me
