[Intro: P. Diddy]
Ayo check this out young blood um
You know I know you're going for this from this
To this spiritual metaphysical transformation
But check this out um at the end of the day God put you on this earth to be a motherfucking MC
And that's to be the baddest MC that you can motherfuckin' be

I'm seeing your consciousness at another level
You gotta save yourself you know, or you just save others
And so that means it's time to fuck up some MCs man
It's time for hip hop, it's time for motherfucking be the king of the jungle, you know what I'm saying?
We walk with God, c'mon, let's go
