Save me
This is too amazing
Heart is beating lazy
If I run babe will you chase me
And make me stay in love
Cause I run

Road run
Slow up
Love shot the gun
I took off toward sun
If you catch me I'm done
You're chasing fire
Hell of a race
First place loser
I can't believe your love got me

Take me
Before my cool escapes me
Love is not so easy
Obstacles keep changing
And I won't go slow
If you don't win babe
Bye bye I'm gone

Road run
Slow up
Love shot the gun
I took off toward sun
If you catch me I'm done
You're chasing fire
Hell of a race
First place loser
I can't believe your love got me

She came over
She walked up to me
And told me
She was always on my time
She was always on my mind
Baby you'll get over
The fear that's holding you now
Can you hold me
Oh please stay
Girl don't go away

Boy I swear
You're the only one
The one that I need
You're the only one
That I'm breathing for
The only one
That got me running
I won't stay

Road run
Slow up
Love shot the gun
I took off toward sun
If you catch me I'm done
You're chasing fire
Hell of a race
First place loser
I can't believe your love got me

Catch me if you can
I'm running
But I'm going miles away
You got the chance
But you're chasing fire
Hell of a race
First place loser
I can't believe your love got me
