Can we just talk about the love and all the things we do
You rub my back and boy you know I'll do the same for you
You treat me good
I'll treat you good
And things will be alright

Come over here my sugar dumpling 'cause it's on tonight...
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
'bout a thing
Because you gave me this ring
You gave me this ring yeah

I won't ever let you down
Said I won't let you down
'Cause my love is your fate
So please hurry don't wait...

I'm gonna give you
All of my love
I'm gonna give you
All of my love
I'm gonna give you
All of my love
I'm gonna give you
All of my love..

Boy don't you know that deep inside you are so beautiful
Beautiful
You're made for me so never ever, ever let me go
Oh no

I never knew someone could set my soul and body free
No time to wait so sugar won't you give your love to me...
And as far as I can see
Far as I can see baby
You're the only one for me
You're the only one for me
And you're everything I need
You're everything I need
'Cause your heart is cared for me
And I don't wanna be free...

It feels so good to find love, sweet love
Yes it does
I'll try not to neglect it
I'll try not
Always cherish every second
Always love you baby

When ever I need you, you're always right there
Always right there
I call you my best friend
I call you my best
Hope this love will never end

I'm gonna
Give you love
Baby I'm gonna give you love
Baby I'm gonna
Give you love
All my love to you...
