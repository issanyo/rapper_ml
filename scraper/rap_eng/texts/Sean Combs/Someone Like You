Chorus:
I've been looking for someone like you
Oh, tell me you're the one
(repeat x2)

Verse one:
I never knew how much I felt for you
Until you came walking into my life
See I've been looking for somebody to love me
Are you the one that I've been searching for?

Repeat chorus

Verse two:
If you take a look at me I'm so sure you'll see
That I'm all you need and more
I want you here by my side, it's only right
'cause it's you I've been looking for

Repeat chorus

Verse three:
Where did you go when I needed you most
It's not the same without you
I need you here by my side so stay close
I'm not the same without you

Repeat chorus

Verse four:
In my heart I always knew you'd be the one
Why can't you see that you're the only one for me?
I've been looking for you

Repeat chorus to fade
