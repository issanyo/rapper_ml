[Verse 1]
I’ve got three children to think about first
I’ve got so much to do
Little time to work
I’ve paid my dues as you can see
Been in all kinds of drama in my life series
The world needs to know that I

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta move on, gotta be strong
Can’t let no one get me down, oh no
Problems they come, problems they go
Can’t let no one get me down, oh no

[Chorus]
What I’m thinking of
Life’s not that important if you don’t have love
Striving for perfection every day
I must make it better than it was the day before
(better than before)

[Verse 2]
Never will I be a fool and take my blessings for granted
I know God’s been by my side
And everything’s gonna be all right

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta move on, gotta be strong
Can’t let no one get me down, oh no
Problems they come, problems they go
Can’t let no one get me down, oh no

[Chorus]
What I’m thinking of
Life’s not that important if you don’t have love
Striving for perfection every day
I must make it better than it was the day before

[Bridge]
Even though you may have to cry
(Dry your eyes)
It will be all right
(Just put your faith...)
Put your faith in the one who makes you strong
(And it will be alright)
The one who makes you strong

[Chorus]
What I’m thinking of
Life’s not that important if you don’t have love
Striving for perfection every day
I must make it better than it was the day before

[Outro]
Life will pass you by in the twinkling of an eye
If you didn’t, now you know
You can’t keep wasting time
We’re getting older every day
There’s more to life than just today
Our future’s not that far away
You can’t keep wasting time
Life will pass you by in the twinkling of an eye
If you didn’t, now you know
You can’t keep wasting time
We’re getting older every day
There’s more to life than just today
Our future’s not that far away
You can’t keep wasting time
Life will pass you by in the twinkling of an eye
If you didn’t, now you know
You can’t keep wasting time
We’re getting older every day
There’s more to life than just today
Our future’s not that far away
You can’t keep wasting time
Life will pass you by in the twinkling of an eye
If you didn’t, now you know
You can’t keep wasting time
We’re getting older every day
There’s more to life than just today
Our future’s not that far away
You can’t keep wasting time
