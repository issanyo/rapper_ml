Verse 1:
(diddy)
Are we living in vain ..are we living in pain
Girl remember my name ..and whatever remains
After we walk on white sand ..lets travel in style
Just want to see you happy and smiling
I can change your life in one flight, lets take off tonight, come on
(dirty money)
We go ..we go down
Love is in ..then its out
We can tell ..tell by now
If it won't ..work out

Bridge:
Lets not forget ..back in brooklyn
Where the future ..first began
Lets start again ..can't be over
Thats what i told her ..and then she said

Chorus:
I hate that you love me so much boy
I hate that you hurt me so much boy
I hate that you love me so much boy
I hate that you hurt me so much boy
I hate that you love me

Verse 2:
(diddy)
One time is enough for me
Close your eyes, theres much to see
So lets jump and both touch the clouds, and we never come down
Its amazing the view is ..
On top of the world where even the air is all brand new here
Fireworks like new years..
Hurt is old news, why would you shed new tears

(dirty money)
Trust in you ..just enough
When our time ..our time is up
If i leave ..will you
Walk away ..from the truth

Bridge:
Lets not forget ..back in brooklyn
Where the future ..first began
Lets start again ..can't be over
Thats what i told her ..and then she said

Chorus:
I hate that you love me so much boy
I hate that you hurt me so much boy
I hate that you love me so much boy
I hate that you hurt me so much boy
I hate that you love me

Verse 3:
(dirty money)
Things i know now, dont allow me to turn back
We been through it all but now i just want my heart back
And i could walk away but see your love is my weakness
Oh' it could be pointless to try and walk away, thats why

Chorus:
I hate that you love me so much boy
I hate that you hurt me so much boy
I hate that you love me so much boy
I hate that you hurt me so much boy
I hate that you love me
