[Verse 1]
You remind me of, of a love I once new before
I was so open for love, so in love with no experience
But I like this feeling, you're really bringing back the memories
Of someone I once knew, I feel you bring it all back to me

[Chorus]
Bring me back to love
'Cause real love is what I'm thinking of
(what I'm thinking of)
It would be so nice if we could runaway (runaway)...runaway

[Verse 2]
It was hard to see, all the wrong my last love did to me
I was just a fool in love
That's not how it was suppposed to be
But I like this feeling, and I don't want you to remind me of
Of someone I once knew
Just keep on bringing me back to love, oh baby, yeah

[Chorus]
Bring me back to love
'Cause real love is what I'm thinking of
(that's what I'm thinking of)
It would be so nice if we could runaway
(if we could runaway) runaway

[Bridge]
You make me feel so good
You treat me like I'm special, baby
So take me back to love
'Cause that is where I wanna be

It's so good it's plain to see
The way that you keep loving me
Bringing back the memories
Of a love that used to be
Said it's so good it's plain to see
That way that you keep loving me
Bringing back the memories
Of a love that used to be

[Chorus]
Bring me back to love
'Cause real love is what I'm thinking of
(that's what I'm thinking of)
It would be so nice if we could runaway
(if we could runaway) runaway

Bring me back to love
'Cause real love is what I'm thinking of
(real love is what I'm thinking of)
It would be so nice if we could runaway
(yeah) runaway

Bring me back to love
'Cause real love is what I'm thinking of
(would be so nice, baby)
It would be so nice if we could runaway
(if we could runaway) runaway

[Chorus]
Bring me back to love
'Cause real love is what I'm thinking of
It would be so nice if we could runaway...runaway
