[Spoken Intro: Gavin Rossdale]
C'est pas possible cet amour
C'est incroyable
Tu me fais transpirer
C'est parfait

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
The payback, the payback

[Verse 1: Gwen Stefani]
Champagne kisses, hold me in your lap of luxury
I only wanna fly first-class desires
You're my limousine
So elegant, the way we ride
Our passion, it just multiplies
There's platinum lightning in the sky
Look, I'm livin' like a queen

[Pre-Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
This kind of love is getting expensive
We know how to live, ba-by
We're luxurious, like Egyptian cotton
We're so rich in love, we're rollin', in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear, baby
Diamond in the rough, is lookin' so sparkly

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
The payback, the payback

[Verse 2: Slim Thug & (Gwen Stefani)]
Slim Thug
I made my stacks now I finally get to lay back (To lay back)
I worked so hard now I finally get the payback (The payback)
And blaze sex, ridin' in back of da Maybach (Chyea) (Maybach)
If it ain't dro', I say no, we don't play that (Play that)
I'm in my house like a Boss reclined
Bumpin on da sticky green, sippin on me some wine (Some wine)
I made it out the hood and I'm feelin real good about
Ridin' in the Benz tryna pull the wood up out (Chyea)

[Pre-Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
This kind of love is getting expensive
We know how to live, ba-by
We're luxurious, like Egyptian cotton
We're so rich in love, we're rollin', in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear, baby
Diamond in the rough, is lookin' so sparkly

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
The payback, the payback
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
The payback, the payback

[Bridge: Gwen Stefani]
Cha-CHIIIIING, cha-CHIIIING
We're loaded and we're not gonna blow it
Cha-CHIIIIING, cha-CHIIIING
We're hooked up with the love cause we grow it
Cha-CHIIIIING, cha-CHIIIING
We got hydroponic love and we're smokin'
Cha-CHIIIIING, cha-CHIIIING
We burn it, you and I, we are so lit
We're so rich in love, we're rollin, in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear, baby
Diamond in the rough, is lookin' so sparkly

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback (This is how we roll)
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back (Luxurious)
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback (Baby, we are so... ex-pen-sive... oh)
The payback, the payback
