[Nicole] + (Diddy)
It's Bad Boy, bitch
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
(It feels good to be back, I missed ya)
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Relax your mind, let your conscious be free
And I roll with the sounds of the BBE
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
(You know what time it is)
(Report to the dance floor)
It's Bad Boy, bitch
(Talk to 'em)

[Verse 1: Nicole Scherzinger]
See you out the corner of my eye
Leanin' on the wall lookin' fly
I want you to come be with me
You're the only one I wanna talk to
But I don't wanna rush

[Hook: Nicole Scherzinger]
I'm here, when will you make your move?
I see you eyein' me, I want cha, why don't cha?
Come to me, I can be, what you need, uh baby
I'm standin', been waitin', I'm yearnin', ooh I'm burnin'
Come to know me, come and get to know me
Come show me, that you wanna know me

[Verse 2: P. Diddy]
You know what it is, I'm back in the building
Security strapped, still stackin' a million
Stunt with a stallion, somethin' Italian
Or maybe Puerto Rican, you can catch me in Paris
I'm in it to win it, I'm willin' to carry
The game, if you think I'm not, look at the carats (look at me, man)
Hop up clean up outta the Phantom
The people go screamin' like an opera anthem (let's go)
I did it before, do it again (do it again)
I got it to blow, got it to spend (got it to spend)
Fly as befo', cool as the wind
Got hits go back like Juice and Gin, yeah
Shine the best and diamond necklace (c'mon)
My extravagant taste, the style perplexes
They know I'm the shit, they wanna get next
That's why she havin' a fit cause she wanted to get next to him
You know my name, you know my motherfucking name

[Hook: Nicole Scherzinger]
I'm here, when will you make your move?
I see you eyein' me, I want cha, why don't cha?
Come to me, I can be, what you need, uh baby
I'm standin', been waitin', I'm yearnin', ooh I'm burnin'
Come to know me, come and get to know me
Come show me, that you wanna know me

[Verse 3: P. Diddy] + (Nicole Scherzinger)
Anywhere I appear, they all stop and stare
Admire your body language speakin' loud and clear like
(I want you to come be with me)
She be waitin' anticipatin' for oh so long
Fantasizing wild thoughts of me comin' on like
(I'm here, when will you make your move?)
She diggin' my style, my swag, my suede, my swerve
My way with words, the boy's absurd for sure
You can't fall 'til my aura call her
I make miracles like I walk on water
What you want mama order, it's on my tab
I'm so bad with the cash, I dropped a whole bag
Where you at girl?

[Hook: Nicole Scherzinger]
I'm here, when will you make your move?
I see you eyein' me, I want cha, why don't cha?
Come to me, I can be, what you need, uh baby
I'm standin', been waitin', I'm yearnin', ooh I'm burnin'
Come to know me, come and get to know me
Come show me, that you wanna know me

[Bridge: Nicole Scherzinger]
I'm here in love, can't wait no more, no
You were the one who stole my heart (you were the one)
Can't you see the wait is over
I need you to come closer
This feeling is getting strong
You really got me hot

[Hook: Nicole Scherzinger]
I see you eyein' me, I want cha, why don't cha?
Come to me, I can be, what you need, uh baby (whatever you need)
I'm standin', been waitin', I'm yearnin', ooh I'm burnin'
Come to know me, come and get to know me
Come show me, that you wanna know me

[Outro: P. Diddy and Nicole Scherzinger]
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Why don't cha come to me
I can be, what you need uh baby
I'm here, you're here, let's make it happen
Do it do it do it do it
Do it do it do it do it
Relax your mind, let your conscious be free
And I roll with the sounds of BBE
Do it, do it
You know what this is
It's Bad Boy bitch
