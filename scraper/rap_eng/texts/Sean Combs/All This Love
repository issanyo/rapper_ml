[Verse 1]
Come on over here
Lay down next to me
Let me tell you something
That I've been meaning to say
For a long time, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, it's been some time
Since we first met, yeah
And every day with you
Is like no other, oh

[Chorus]
All this love you're giving me
I know just what to do
I'll take the love you're giving me
And give my love to you

[Verse 2]
You give your love so freely
And you give it so abundantly
I just want to be able
To give it back to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on, baby
Let me tell you
Tell you all the things I feel
'Cause if it wasn't for your love, oh yeah
I don't think I would know what's real

[Chorus]
All this love you're giving me
I know just what to do
I'll take the love you're giving me
And give my love to you

[Bridge]
You got me singing la la la
La la la laaa
La la la laaa la la la
Whoa, la la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la laaa
La la la laaa la la la
La la la la la la
You got me singing
La la la laaa
La la la laaa la la la
La la la la la la
La la la laaa
La la la laaa la la la
La la la la la la

[Outro]
All this love you're giving me
I wanna give, just let me give it back to you
All this love you're giving me
I wanna give, just let me give it back to you
All this love you're giving me
I wanna give, just let me give it back to you
All this love you're giving me
I wanna give, just let me give it back to you
All this love you're giving me
I wanna give, just let me give it back to you
All this love you're giving me
I wanna give, just let me give it back to you
All this love you're giving me
I wanna give, just let me give it back to you
All this love you're giving me
I wanna give, just let me give it back to you
All this love you're giving me
I wanna give, just let me give it back to you
