[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Girl, I want you face down first thing when I wake up

Don't tease me right now, baby, please me right now
Girl, scream “Yes” if you with it

Girl, it ain't the same if I ain't got your love

If you do it good, boy I'll return the favor
Baby, I'm tired of the bed I wanna try it on the table

Don't tease me right now, better please me right now

[Bridge: Dirty Money]
