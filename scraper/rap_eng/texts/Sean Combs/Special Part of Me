You know when you...
Finally find that person that...
Makes you feel like you're really alive
Like you're somebody, like you mean something to the world...

Feels so good to be loved
Yes it does
Ooooh
Ooooh

Feels so good to see
You right here with me
Safe is what I feel when you're around
(uh hu)
Strong but sensitive
When you're touching me
The simple things from you is what I need...

You will always be a special part of me
Boy you make me feel like someone does love me
I'm in love
No one ever gave me what you did to me
You turned the little girl into the woman I should be
I'm in love...

Boy you really turn me on
Even when something's wrong
Is there anything that I can do for you (baby)
I just wanna comfort you
There's nothing I'd rather do
You make me feel so good I wanna cry
All the time...

You will always be a special part of me
Boy you make me feel like someone does love me
I'm in love
No one ever gave me what you did to me
You turned the little girl into the woman I should be
I'm in love...

Baby hold me
(Baby hold me)
Don't let go of me
(Don't let go of me baby, baby)
Baby hold me
(Boy you better hold me)
Don't let go of me
(Don't let goooooo)
Baby hold me
(ooooooh)
Don't let go of me
(Don't let go, don't let gooooo)
Baby hold me
(Oh baby hold me)
Don't let go of me
(Don't let go, you...)

You will always be a special part of me
Boy you make me feel like someone does love me
I'm in love
No one ever gave me what you did to me
You turned the little girl into the woman I should be
I'm in love...
