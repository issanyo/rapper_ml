(Verse)

Who shot ya ?

Hear more screams than the opera

Sneaker copper

I need a helicopter

Fuck a Bugatti

Woke up in my same bed

Text books holding it up

On it's weak leg

Everyone

Wanna be killers

And grow dreads

I still bump Ma$e

Cause cuz I want bread

Dinero pesos

And chicas that's Fuego

Benz mayo

Leather interior

Smell day old

Black insides

Like Apartheid

P90s rip apart sides

Turn you to a turkey that's jive

I will not lose

Playing by cash rules

Cause cash rules

You can't practice cool

I'm cocky on the mic

You dudes got fake hits

Like  rocky at the fight

I'm nasty wit the right

But deadly with the left

Do the right thing

Or you will get left

Fuck a vest

3 in ya neck

Save ya breath

Cut the check

For the best

Crazy wit the aim

Like da cracker from Virgina Tech

I'm ready to push a Lex down Lex

Fly in a jet

That get

Higher than smoking DC wet

And Mayweather bets

I bet Any track DJs throw me

On I wreck

Cause I was trained

To mend your brain

When I drop game

It's not the same

Yea they call me L

But you gonna  take my name

And I'll take ya dame

It's a shame

If my big picture can't fit in ya frame

Fucking lames

Stay in ya lane

They say he should of dropped sooner

Cuz I do the fucking thing

Like honey moon-ers

I get around

No rumor

Probably don't get that

Bad humor

Vocals cancerous

To the brain like a tumor

I'm fire smoking

You niggas no fumar

Rap 2nd coming

Even sooner

Return of the ruler
