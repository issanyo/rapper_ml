Money Makin' Mitch

( Honorable C-Note)
Yea, shoutout to my daddy
Yea, man! Ayy yo, this ones for you, pops
Check it out:

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Cocaine on the table, I wasn't always able
I watch these niggas get rich selling these fucking fables
They like to cook the numbers, we don't cook the numbers
We just want the summer, you can have that woman

[Hook: Puff Daddy]
These niggas really out here tripping, man
I can't feel my face
I can't feel my face

[Verse 2: Gizzle]
Cop another Q, cop another Coupe
(Yea, let's go)
My niggas from Jamaica, know that shit for true
(Blood, fire)
(Blow! Blow! Blow!)
Crazy out my mind, crazy out my mind
Yo bitches on my line, I'm tryna find some time

[Hook: Puff Daddy]
These niggas really out here trippin', man
I can't feel my face
I can't feel my face

[Bridge: Gizzle, (Puff Daddy)]
That pack jumpin', those fiends comin'
That line all down the block
(That mean that soft comin', that beam comin')
(Them diamonds floodin' my watch)
That pack jumpin', them fiends comin'
That line all down the block
(That mean that soft comin', that beam comin')
(Them diamonds floodin' my watch)
On, on, on any block
On, on, on any block

[Verse 3: Gizzle]
It was cocaine on the table, baby
The shit was Cain and Abel, baby
And I been seein' angels lately
And I just make it flip, make the grip
And make my lady crazy
I'm so eighties, baby, '88 Mercedes
Bring your friends, let them live
And if they live, then you can bring your friends again
And they can bring some friends with them
Cause we just talk fly, and we just walk fly
And look you in your eyes cause [Jesus ?] got eyes
So we dress God-like, and we go star-life
You live yours once, but we live ours twice
What's in these streets? Take your chances
Till my hustle advance
Shit, you niggas got bands? Well, I got bandwidth
And I get sandwiched nightly by two things that just speak Spanish
One making tacos, one making a sandwich
(I can't feel my face)
Arguing over who I'm about to take me a bath with
(We can't feel a thang)
[Laughs], yeah
