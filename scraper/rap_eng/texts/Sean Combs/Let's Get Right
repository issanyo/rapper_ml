Pick up the phone

Now you know how hard it is for a man to make it
And I'm trying to do the best that I can
Baby, I know I was wrong
I'm so sorry, please forgive me

'Cause I can't live without you, I would never doubt you
Forever we'll stay together, yeah
I could never see, I could never love
Nobody but you for me

You make happy days
