While you stare in amazement, I'm hotter than Cajun
You're blazin, throwin up my tre's in, who want 'em?

Simple and plain (plain), the reason why I entered the game
(that's right) I seen Sean do it, so I'm tryin to get it the same
(let's go) Pimpin ain't changed, niggas still gettin 'em thangs
Got the six with Shaquille feet rippin 'em lanes
Got a chick that's a real freak givin me brains
The temperature changed, soon as nigga get off the plane
So ya know a nigga gettin some change, stand over the game
While do they shake they shoulders the same? (why?)
We get money, they ain't supposed to be playin
So what we supposed be sayin
You niggas actin like these crackers ain't payin
So let's get it (you got it), so let did it again (c'mon)

Soul Controller (yeah!), rap Ayatollah
Kids hate me when they older I put cracks by the stroller

Give some bakin soda and a quarter (yeah)
Bet I flow straight up out the water
I'mma wreck the game 'til it say "Out of order"
(uh-huh) Put the high score up, then tear the floor up
On the world tour with your whore out in Europe
Head on the tour bus (ehh)
Do what them niggas in the drop thinks cooler
Called up five reporters to thank my supporters
Hittin wives and daughters
Brought 'em neck spray from Estee Lauders
Call Puffy to order

[P. Diddy]
Aiyyo, call me Diddy, I run this city
Send the cops, the D.A. and feds to come get me
Cats wanna leave me for dead you comin with me
Gettin head in the Bentley red at one fifty (aah!)
Straight lose it, love two things my money my music
Might co-write and produce it, drop mine, hot 9 exclusive
Got y'all +Hulkin+ like +Bruce+ did (say what, say what?)
Cause I can, break backs and stacks, it's no problem
(no problem) Make raps and tracks and go Harlem
I get worldwide coverage
I got so many spots I don't even buy luggage
Ya love it; make moves major, hide out in Asia
If your girl keep comin around them I'm a blaze her
I'm the Bad Boy flavor, light blue gators
NOT GUILTY!! {*echoe*} C'mon

The Saga Continues, The Saga Continues

[Black Rob]
I be the east side Soprano, Rob Marciano
Flow in each channel with the Iverson handle (c'mon)
Forty-five sparks (haha) turn your day gray flannel
Snatch the yay of the mantle, then proceed to dismantle
Can't slay Rob
How many niggas done tried to play mob, quit they day job
Tired of putting broke niggas under the wing
If I go to jail again I'm going under the bing
Act like you gonna pull that thing thing
You the only one that always get stuck for bling bling
I represent "A" block in Sing Sing
Almost caught a buck fifty for fuckin a Latin King's queen
(oh papi!) Moves for paper, booze no chaser
Bullets out the blazer four-fifths with laser (take that)
Come and get your shit splitted, newspapers say I did it
(he ain't do it) Now let's get it (let's get it)
