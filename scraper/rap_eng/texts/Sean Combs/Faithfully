[Verse 1]
Nothing could compare to your love
I wake up feeling good every day
I used to have a problem with love
Until you rode direct in my way

[Chorus]
Faithfully (faithfully)
You love me, you're just what I need
Please don't change
Everyone can see that you love me faithfully

[Verse 2]
Some say love is just a word
But I know what it really means
A future and stability is what
That is what you've given to me, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Even though we've had many arguments (many arguments)
This is stronger than any love has ever been
(stronger, oh yeah)
Baby, through it all you've been there for me
And I love you just because you love faithfully

[Chorus]
Faithfully (baby, faithfully)
You love me, you're just what I need
Please don't change (don't change, don't change)
Everyone can see that you love me faithfully
(loving me so faithfully)
Faithfully (baby, nothing could compare to...)
You love me, you're just what I need
(...your love, your love)
Please don't change
Everyone can see that you love me faithfully

[Bridge]
Don't ever change, I just won't be the same
If you take your love away
I don't ever wanna think about you not being in my life
Because you love me so faithfully

[Chorus]
Faithfully (faithfully, you love me)
You love me, you're just what I need (oh, I love you)
Please don't change (don't change)
Everyone can see that you love me faithfully
(you love me faithfully)
Faithfully
(used to have a problem with love...)
You love me, you're just what I need
(...but now you love me faithfully)
Please don't change (oh baby)
Everyone can see that you love me faithfully
(you love me so faithfully)
Faithfully
You love me, you're just what I need
(loving me, loving me faithfully)
Please don't change
Everyone can see that you love me faithfully
('cause I love you)
Faithfully (I need you, and I want you)
You love me, you're just what I need
('cause you love me faithfully)
Please don't change (don't take your love away)
Everyone can see that you love me faithfully
