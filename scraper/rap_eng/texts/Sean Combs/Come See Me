1 - Baby you can come see me cause I need you here with me
And I'll show you what love is made of
Later on if you are free baby you can come see me
And I'll show you what love is made of
It's been a while, and I'm sitting here thinking of
How it felt when we first made love
Oh I need that feeling again
Nobody can compare, so
Come with me and I'll go with you
To this place that lovers dream of
We can do anything, sexy things
And I'm here to let you know
Repeat 1
It's been awhile, thinking about the last time I held you
And the smell of your sweet perfume, babe
The way I felt when you left my room
Oh I wanna feel that way tonight
Come with me and I'll go with you
To this place that lovers dream of
We can do anything, sexy things
And I'm here to let you know
Repeat 1
Repeat 1
Now that bodysuit that your wearing girl, it fits you like paint
You think I'm gonna sit here and pass this chance when I ain't
I got some thoughts set on you how many things we can do
How many women in my life but yet I only love you
You're number one on my list, and I, I reminisce over our first kiss
And girlfriend, yo picture this
Let's relight the candle, give this one more shot
I never meant to mistreat ya girl, I need you right now
Repeat 1
Ad lib until fade
