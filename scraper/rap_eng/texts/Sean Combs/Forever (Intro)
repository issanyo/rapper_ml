Forever, timeless
Never ending, forever
Eternal, timeless

{Tonight in L.A., rapper Notorious B.I.G
Was gunned down at the media party
He was pronounced dead on arrival
No suspects have been taken into custody}

{Combs' trouble seems to continue
As he turned himself in today to local police
For an alleged assault and battery charge
He posted bail and was released on his own recognizance}

Forever, timeless
Never ending, forever

In my distress, I prayed to the Lord
An' the Lord answered an' rescued me
The Lord is for me, so I will not be afraid
What can mere mortals do to me?

Yes, the Lord is for me, He will help me
I will look in triumph at those who hate me
It's better to trust the Lord
Than to put confidence in people
It's better to trust the Lord
Than to put confidence in Princes

Though hostile nations surrounded me
I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord
Yes, they surrounded an' attacked me
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord

They swarmed around me like bees
They blazed against me like roarin' flames
But I destroyed them all in the name of the Lord
The Lord is my strength an' my song
He has become my victory

Lord, forgive them for they know not what they do
