[Intro: Total (The Notorious B.I.G.)]
(Uh
Uh, what)
As we proceed, to give you what you need
9-5, motherfuckers
Get live, motherfuckers
Biggie, gimme one more chance
Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance (check it out, uh)
Biggie, gimme (lyrically I'm) one more chance
Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance (uh, uh)
Biggie (what) gimme one more chance
Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance (uh, Junior M.A.F.I.A.)
Biggie (uh) gimme (Junior M.A.F.I.A.) one more chance (uh)
Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance

[Verse 1]
First things first: I, Poppa, freaks all the honeys
Dummies, Playboy bunnies, those wanting money
Those the ones I like cause they don't get nathan but penetration
Unless it smells like sanitation
Gar-bage
I turn like doorknobs
Heart throb never, Black and ugly as ever
However, I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi
Girls pee-pee when they see me
Navajos creep me in they teepee
As I lay down laws like Alan Kopit
Stop it - if you think they gonna make a profit
Don't see my ones, don't see my guns, get it?
Now tell your friends Poppa hit it, then split it
In two as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A
I don't know what the hell is stopping ya
I'm clocking ya, Versace shades watching ya
Once ya grin, I'm in—game begins
First I talk about how I dress in this
Diamond necklaces, stretch Lexuses
The sex is just immaculate from the back
I get
Deeper and deeper, help you reach the
Climax that your man can't make
Call him, tell him you'll be home real late
And sing the break, uh)

[Chorus: Total (The Notorious B.I.G.)]
Biggie, give me (I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
One more
Give me one more
Chance, and make me
Gimme one more chance (uh)
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance


[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
She's sick of that song on how it's so long
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
There I is, Major Payne like Damon Wayans
Low Down Dirty, even, like his brother Keenan
Schemin', don't leave your girl around me!
True player for real, ask Puff Daddy
You ringing bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel
Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell
She beeped me meet me at twelve
Where you at? Flipping jobs, paying car notes?
While I'm swimming in your women like the breast stroke
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroke—tongue all down her throat
Nothing left to do but send her home to you
I'm through—can you sing the song for me boo?

[Chorus: Total (The Notorious B.I.G.)]
Biggie, give me, one more
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Give me one more
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Chance, and make me
Gimme one more chance (uh)
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
So what's it gonna be? Him or me? (uh)
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls
The envy of all women, crushed linen
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in ’em
The finest women I love with a passion
Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin'
High fashion, flying into all states
Sexing me while your man masturbates
Isn't this great?
Your flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
I'm not only a client, I'm the player President (uh)

[Chorus: Total (The Notorious B.I.G.)]
Biggie, give me, one more
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Give me one more
Chance, and make me
Gimme one more chance (uh)
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance

[Outro: Total (The Notorious B.I.G.)]
Biggie, gimme one more chance
Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance
Biggie, gimme one more chance
Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance
Biggie, gimme one more chance
Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance
Biggie, gimme one more chance
Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance
Biggie, gimme one more chance
Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance
Biggie, gimme one more chance
Biggie, Biggie, gimme one more chance
Biggie, gimme one more chance
