[Intro: Jadakiss & Puff Daddy]
Uh, yeah, uh huh, yeah
Uh huh, yeah
Uh huh, yeah, yeah
That's another one
Uh huh, yeah, yeah
And another one, and another one

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
You got me where you want me
We could listen to Levert while leavin' the country
And then Sweat it out when you feelin' comfy
Or play Gill to the minute that you say you hungry
Uh, you got me where you want me
We could listen to Levert while leavin' the country
And then Sweat it out when you feelin' comfy
Or play Gill to the minute that you say you hungry
Uh, you got me where you want me
We could listen to Levert while leavin' the country
And then Sweat it out when you feelin' comfy
Or play Gill to the minute that you say you hungry

[Verse 1: Johnny Gill]
I know you need love and understanding
Sometimes feel like I can't give you more of my time
You keep on wantin' me to be there girl but I can't be
Why you keep stressin' me when you know I'm doing my best
I keep on telling you I do the best that I can do
How can I get through to you
Everything I do is for you

[LSG]
You got me where you want me (got me where you want me, babe)
Take me (take me, baby)
Tell me what you want
Anywhere you wanna go is for me, girl (anywhere you wanna go is for me, girl )
You got me (got me)
Take me (take be, baby)

[Keith Sweat]
I can't keep on goin' through these changes
The more you doubt me, you keep pushin' me away, girl
(You) make a mess girl (keep on wanting more)
I'm doing my best (I'm doin') the best that can I do, baby (Everything for you)
Everythang, everythang

[LSG]
You got me where you want me (got me where you want me, babe)
Take me (take me), baby
Tell me what you want
Anywhere you wanna go is for me, girl (anywhere you wanna go is for me, girl )
You got me (got me)
Take me (take be, baby)

[LSG]
Girl, you got me yearnin' (got me yearnin')
Yearnin' to know what I'll do with love
Can you tell me what I'm doin'?
But I'm always saying you don't understand
I'll never leave you alone

[LSG]
You got me where you want me (got me where you want me, babe)
Take me (take me), baby
Tell me what you want
Anywhere you wanna go is for me, girl (anywhere you wanna go is for me, girl)
You got me (got me)
Take me (take be, baby)
