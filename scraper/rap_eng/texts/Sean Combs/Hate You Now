[Verse 1: Kaleena]
I don't even know if i've found redemption
Cause I still hear something, whispering
Trying to tell me something about you
Don't know how to tell him I'm through
Gave you my sanity, you gave me a chance to leave
You telling me I dont need you
I dont believe you, cause I dont need nobody like you

[Hook: Kaleena]
Don't go, don't go, don't want you I hate you
Don't go, don't go, don't want you I hate you
Don't go, don't go, don't want you I hate you
Don't go, don't go, don't want you I hate you

[Verse 2: Diddy]
21 gun salute to the sky
I smoke my reefer getting high
You know without you I'mma die
You clip my wings now I can't fly
My momma told me never cry
She never taught me to say bye
I cannot let you go, I tried
I hate you girl you know I lie
I hate you girl you know I lie

[Verse 3: Dawn]
Boy you're gonna have to use your senses
Just to figure out the distance
Difference, how you want to love me you choose
Except for why you're looking confused
I gave you my sanity, I gave you a chance to leave
Telling me I dont need you, I dont believe you
Cause I dont need nobody like you

[Hook: Kaleena]
Don't go, don't go, don't want you I hate you
Don't go, don't go, don't want you I hate you
Don't go, don't go, don't want you I hate you
Don't go, don't go, don't want you I hate you

[Verse 4: Diddy]
You's a motherfucking bitch to me
You just let me bleed
You just let me leave
Now I cannot see
Cause when I cry, I cry tears of blood
You the one I love
You the one I love
You the one I trust
And you say you can't fuck with me?
I can't fuck with you
We can't fuck with we
And we cannot see
I hate you girl you know I lie
I hate you girl you know I lie

[Outro: Kaleena & Dawn Richard]
Can't stand you baby please dont go
I'd rather hate you, then see you out the door
Baby, ain't no love left here for you
If that's what I'm telling you, I hate loving you
I dont wanna, dont wanna be without you
Why not tell the truth?
I hate loving you
I don't wannna, dont wanna be without you
I let you control my heart, baby but it went too far
Don't go, don't go, don't want you I hate you
Don't go, don't go, don't want you I hate you
