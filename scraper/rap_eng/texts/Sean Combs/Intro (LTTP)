Sometimes you can meet somebody
And that'll change your life forever

You see

Love is a motherfucker
(love is a motherfucker)

Sometimes you can meet somebody
And they could just take your soul

Sometimes you can meet somebody
And they could just take your soul

Can you hear me

Can you feel me
(let's go)

I knew it had to happen
(I knew when I saw her)
I knew it had to happen

(let's go)
That's the way it is sometimes
Can't explain it
It's Gods work
God if you can hear me
Please help me
