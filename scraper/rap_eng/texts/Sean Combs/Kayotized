Ha, sicker than ya average, pick out your favorite rappers/ haven't met a emcee this ill since Marshall Mather's/ find me in a throwback snapback on backwards/ while your girl swallow my kids, family matters/  urkel, Stephon fresh out of the machine/ purple, activist, cups filled with the lean/snatching up some twins now they yealling Owee/ leaving sauce on they face while they drip dripp-ing ha,/ I was born a playa been macking on all broads/ they fall to they knees but not to call God/ I know y'all sick of this, Mo City representive/ who steady slide in your wife and all of her women friends/ so get with this, you can learn a little steez/ and give the kink hoes(kinko's) another copy of me/ at ease, I'm too playa right/plumber when I lay the pipe/ leave they mouths open make em' wonder what the flava like/ I'm down for any beef tell me who want it/ Hire entertainment in this bitch we run this/

(Rosie Bush) (Chorus)

K.A.Y.O, K.A.Y.O, K.A.Y.O can't you see it's not another emcee with yo steez. That explains why, they get so weak. And everyone else just hates with envy

(Beat changes)

(Rosie Bush) it's H.I.R.E biiiiiittttccchhhhhhh

(K.A.Y.O verse) Who hot who not/ killing rappers nonstop/ if you think he gon' pop he'll make that bomb drop/ like the, funk, master, he flex on hoes/ sexy clothes, all they do is come out those/ once I give them the pickle they'd be veget-abled/ laid up stretched out in they editables/ D.O.A, haters want to see yo pay/ put on edge, blow, like Cee-Lo face/ see those snakes, always plotting on grips/  plot and shit, put something hot in your whip/ just to have a easy come up/ in the sum-mer, get jacked for your rims and turn your bump up/  that's what it do in the long star state/ ride in candy lacs and chopping the blades/ just chunk up the duece with the south side fades/ while the slab parked crooked get at ya dames/ hol'up, sod-a, mixed with the purp/ roll up, sowed up, see me drenched in orange(orunge)/ that's me, hopping out so pigeon toed/ different hoes, my mind in a different mode/ and I'm always on time in a different zone/ since Big passed away I'm like where is my throne?/ hold on/
