[Verse 1]
How many times have you seen me looking so happy?
You'll never understand
In time you'll see how much you mean to me
Let's not ever change, hear me when I say
You, you seem to be the perfect man for me
You have a way about you, yeah-yeah
That lets me know, you're the only one I want and need
Please don't ever change, stay the same

[Chorus]
Don't ever change the way
The way you feel today
Don't ever take your love away
If you love me, if you love me

Don't ever change the way
The way you feel today
Don't ever take your love away
If you love me, if you love me

[Verse 2]
Do you really know how you make me feel
Whenever you're here? Hey-hey
I gotta let you know, any time you need me
All you gotta do is call, I'll be around

[Chorus]
Don't ever change the way
The way you feel today
Don't ever take your love away
If you love me, if you love me

Don't ever change the way
The way you feel today
Don't ever take your love away
If you love me, if you love me

Don't ever change the way
The way you feel today
Don't ever take your love away
If you love me, if you love me

Don't ever change the way
The way you feel today
Don't ever take your love away
If you love me, if you love me

[Outro]
Shooby doo-wop, shoo-doo-wop, I wanna love you
Oh boy I wanna love you now
Shooby doo-wop, shoo-doo-wop, I wanna love you
Ain't ever had no love like this before
Shooby doo-wop, shoo-doo-wop, I wanna love you
Can't you see what you do to me
Shooby doo-wop, shoo-doo-wop, I wanna love you
I can't take this love no more
Shooby doo-wop, shoo-doo-wop, I wanna love you
I wanna love you baby, love you baby
Shooby doo-wop, shoo-doo-wop, I wanna love you
That's all I wanna do
