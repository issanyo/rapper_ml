[Chorus]
I'll rub your back, wash your hair
I'll do anything, I don't care
I'll cook your food, buy your clothes
To the limit I will go
I will go

[Verse 1: Nathan]
I guess you wonder where I've been
I've been thinking about the perfect way
To express my thoughts within
You mean everything to me
And I wanna be the only man
To supply your needs

[Chorus]
I'll rub your back, wash your hair
I'll do anything, I don't care
I'll cook your food, buy your clothes
To the limit I will go
I will go

[Verse 2: Shawn]
I await your precious kiss
Gets my head when they spread sweet and wet
Across my lips
I respond to every single touch
Got me open on your love
Wanna give you so much

[Chorus]
I'll rub your back, wash your hair
I'll do anything, I don't care
I'll cook your food, buy your clothes
To the limit I will go
I will go

[Outro: Mike]
Ooooh....The things I do for you
Take you out for a night on the town
And after, I'd run you some bath water
With some bubbles
Do you like bubbles
I'll dry you off
And lotion your body down
You'd like that, wouldn't you
I'll do anything you want me to
You know I don't care
You know when we're done
I could paint your toe nails for you
And I'd blow them dry
