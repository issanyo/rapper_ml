What we gon do about us...
What we gon do about us...
What we gon do about us....
What what what what what

All this time...youve been standin in front of my face
Didn't matter cuz i knew what it was
You around me made me feel that way ay ay
We used to be good friends....but some good things come to an end
Maybe thats when true love can begin....and go all they way ay ay...
Oh yea ea ea

{chorus}
Baby never thought the day would come *(what what)*
Tired of bein too young....too young
Where these feelings comin from?...like the way im feelin now *( feeling now now)*
Never thought that this would be *(oh yea)*....
Its been botherin me *(oh yea)*....baby tell me can we be...
Together forever
Tell me what we gon do about us *( what we gon do about us)*
Let me know if this is real love....let me know if i found the one...

Let me know if this is real love....let meknow if i found the one...

When i first laid eyes on you....thought my dreams had just come true
And i never imagined what love could really be about...
Who ever knew youd be the one...where did all these feelings come from?
And i think that we have a lot of things to talk about
