[Chorus]
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
'Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be

[Verse 1]
First time I saw her
Thought that I would lose my mind
Just had to have her
I had to have her in my life

[Pre-Chorus]
The way you make me feel
Is like no other feeling that I've had (I've ever had) before
You give the kind of lovin'
Make a brother wanna come for more
And more she's the one I adore

[Chorus]
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
'Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be

[Verse 2]
Just can't believe it
She's got me open all the time
She knows I'm never leavin'
Can't be wrong 'cause it feels so right
The way you make me feel

[Pre-Chorus]
The way you make me feel
Is like no other feeling that I've had (I've ever had) before
You give the kind of lovin'
Make a brother wanna come for more
And more she's the one I adore and that's why

[Chorus]
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
'Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be

[Bridge]
No one can do what you do
When you do what you're doin to me
And I can't believe can it be that it's me
That you're feelin'
It's ecstasy

[Chorus]
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
'Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be

[Bridge]
No one can do what you do
When you do what you're doin to me
And I can't believe can it be that it's me
That you're feelin'
It's ecstasy

[Chorus]
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
'Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
'Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be
