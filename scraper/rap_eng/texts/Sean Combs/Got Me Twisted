[Verse 1: Faith Evans]
Why you keep on playin' when you know that I don't have time for the foolish games? These days ain't no way
'Cause I'm out here chasin' more than just a dollar in the dream
And if you want to be on my team, act accordingly
Because I put in work for this and I deserve the very best
You gotta give and I won't take no shorts, won't settle for less (settle for less)
Boy, don't make me call you out and even try to hear the bullshit you talkin' 'bout
Lately, I feel like gonna goin' crazy

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
I care for you, was there for you (was there for you)
Have plans for you, seems like you got me twisted
And I won't take it no-no more (no more)
'Cause I can't think it you got me twisted
And I won't take it no-no more
'Cause I can't think it you got me twisted

[Verse 2: Faith Evans]
Ever since you gave me a dose of reality
I'm not afraid to go my own direction now (shit done changed)
I guess I'm on a different way, it don't add up 'cause I did the math
R.E.S.P.E.C.T, is that too much to ask?

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
I care for you, was there for you ( baby, I was there for you)
Have plans for you, seems like you got me twisted
And I won't take it no-no more
'Cause I can't think it you got me twisted
And I won't take it no-no more
'Cause I can't think it you got me twisted

[Verse 3: Faith Evans & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Gazelle shades and corn braids
We was both so made, we was gettin' paid
The way we talked together changed the whole game (but)
People in your ear got you changed on me
It's like you you weren't the man you claimed to be
Puttin' dirt on my name and defamin' me
Man, that shit so lame to me (all it is to me, is a mystery)

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
I care for you, was there for you
Have plans for you, seems like you got me twisted
And I won't take it no-no more
'Cause I can't think it you got me twisted
And I won't take it no-no more
'Cause I can't think it you got me twisted
