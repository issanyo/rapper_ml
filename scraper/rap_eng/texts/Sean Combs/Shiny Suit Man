[Sean “Puff Daddy/Puffy/P. Diddy/Diddy” Combs]
Yo, what up? It’s Shiny Suit Man
I know you’ve heard my name before
You know, whether it was out the mouths of other rappers
Or, you know, of The LOX
Or, you know, whoever else wants to say my name, Shiny Suit Man
But then not want to say my government name
My government name is Sean Combs, Sean John Combs
Some of you may even know me as Puffy, Puff Daddy, or P. Diddy
But I just wanted to get the record straight
That when they talking about the shiny suit, they talking about me
And I own this $500 million-dollar shiny suit
And, oh yeah, next time, say name, if you really a man
Just call on SHINY SUIT MAN! Hahaha
