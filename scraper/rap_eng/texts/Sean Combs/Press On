Life has a way of making you live it
Sometimes it takes you to giving it
Do you fold or do you play on?
The next move always depends on you
If your work is good then it's trouble at home
If your moves is right
Then your dough is tight
It's like running a engine on no fuel
How do you play in a game with no rules?

(It's always a fight)
A constant battle in my mind. (No place to run, no were to hide)
I gotta keep moving on, I gotta at least try...
(Dealing with the pressures of everyday life)
Gotta go the extra mile just can't throw in the towel
You would be so amazed by the things that I can take...

I got troubles with in, troubles with out
Making it through but tryin' to figure it out
Tryin' to stay right when the world is so wrong
But I gotta keep moving and press on
Gotta stay real, tryin' to be strong
Takin' the blows but gotta hold on
Tryin' to stay right but the world is so wrong
But I gotta keep moving and press on, press on

It's such a shame the more that you give the more that you have to wait
For some one to appreciate all the moves you make
All the chances you gotta take
The way to get ahead is to have the fear in your eyes
The only way to get by is for you never let'em see you sweat
You sure better not let'em see you cry...

(It's always a fight)
A constant battle in my mind
(No place to run, no were to hide)
I gotta keep moving on, I gotta at least try...
(Dealing with the pressures of everyday life)
Gotta go the extra mile just can't throw in the towel
You would be so amazed by the things that I can take...

I got troubles with in, troubles with out
Making it through but tryin' to figure it out
Tryin' to stay right when the world is so wrong
But I gotta keep moving and press on
Gotta stay real, tryin' to be strong
Takin' the blows but gotta hold on
Tryin' to stay right but the world is so wrong
But I gotta keep moving and press on, press on

Everyday it's something new to face
Every night praying that I'll survive
Oh oh ooh
Tryin' to deal with the pressure
Every time I try to get ahead
Every mistake I make they try to do me in
Whoa oh ohh!
How much more?
Ooh, ooh
Ooh

(It's always a fight)
A constant battle in my mind. (No place to run, no were to hide)
I gotta keep moving on, I gotta at least try...
(Dealing with the pressures of everyday life)
Gotta go the extra mile just can't throw in the towel
You would be so amazed by the things that I can take...

I got troubles with in, troubles with out
Making it through but tryin' to figure it out
Tryin' to stay right when the world is so wrong
But I gotta keep moving and press on
Gotta stay real, tryin' to be strong
Takin' the blows but gotta hold on
Tryin' to stay right but the world is so wrong
But I gotta keep moving and press on, press on
