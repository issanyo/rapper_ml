[Chorus]
You turn the rain into sunny days
You take the clouds away
Baby, you're the one
I feel like heaven's a step away
He sent an angel my way
Baby, you're the one

[Verse 1]
I remember when
I used to be afraid to love again
But now I realize
That you're the one who brings the sun
You turn

[Chorus]
You turn the rain into sunny days
You take the clouds away
Baby, you're the one
I feel like heaven's a step away
(Feel like heaven's just a step...)
He sent an angel my way
Baby, you're the one

[Verse 2]
Something real I can feel
I was searching for
I didn't wanna hurt no more
Then you came, made a change
Since you came and made it right
I can love you all my days

[Chorus]
You turn the rain into sunny days
You take the clouds away
Baby, you're the one
I feel like heaven's a step away
He sent an angel my way
Baby, you're the one

[Verse 3]
Can you tell me where would I be?
What would I do if I hadn't found you?
Though I've been in love before
You can be compared to none
'Cause you really bring the sun

[Chorus]
You turn the rain into sunny days
You take the clouds away
Baby, you're the one
I feel like heaven's a step away
He sent an angel my way
Baby, you're the one

[Bridge]
Baby, I always try to hide
To hide the way that I feel for you
But I can't lie
That you're the one for me
You bring me ecstasy

[Chorus]
You turn the rain into sunny days
You take the clouds away
Baby, you're the one
I feel like heaven's a step away
He sent an angel my way
Baby, you're the one

You turn the rain into sunny days
You take the clouds away
Baby, you're the one
I feel like heaven's a step away
He sent an angel my way
Baby, you're the one

[Outro]
Sunshine in my life
No more stormy days
Sunshine in my life
No more stormy days
Sunshine in my life
No more stormy days
