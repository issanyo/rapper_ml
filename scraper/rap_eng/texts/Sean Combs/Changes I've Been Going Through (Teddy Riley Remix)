[Chorus 1]
Can’t you see what I’ve been doing through ‘cause I wanna be with you
Changes I’ve been going through ‘cause I wanna be with you
Can’t you see what I’ve been doing through ‘cause I wanna be with you
Changes I’ve been going through ‘cause I wanna be with you
Can’t you see what…

[Verse 1]
It’s all gone, the moment that we shared is gone away
Maybe it’s better that we didn’t stay together
Seems like we’ve gone through this a thousand times
Baby, I still don’t have the answer
Why can’t you tell me why we couldn’t be together?

[Chorus 2]
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Be with me)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Be with me)
Can’t you see what…

[Verse 2]
See, I didn’t want to ever want to cry
But still I need love and affection
Was it that hard for you to show me some attention?
Tell me, baby, did I push you away?
Was I coming on strong for you?
Why can’t you tell me, tell me what am I to do?

[Chorus 2]
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Baby, don’t you wanna be with me?)
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Be with me)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Be with me)
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Be with me—don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Don’t you wanna be with me)
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
(Don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
(Don’t you wanna be with me?)
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
(Don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
‘Cause I want…
(Don’t you wanna be with me?)
Can’t you see what I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Don’t you wanna be with me?)
Changes I’ve been going through
'Cause I wanna be with you
(Don’t you wanna be with me)
