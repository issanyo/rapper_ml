Well I be Puba on this chair
The nigga from last year
Girbauds hanging baggy
Tommy Hilfiger top gear
Take no shorts
I'm doin lovely in all sports
Even swing the pole
At the hole on my golf course
Some say I'm fair, see cause I'm
Horny and nasty, If I see
Some rugged joints
Then I want let it pass me
I take no shorts
Let suckers step up to see
I'll flip the script
And get harder than Jeopardy
I shot the sheriff and the
Mutherfuckin deputy, test me
Check it, I'm not Keith Sweat
But bet that ass that i can make it last
Skirts turn their head so fast
They end up catching whiplash
If hun's a monster
I'm Carl Lewis on the meter dash
It's Grand Puba baby and I'm gettin crazy cash
What's the 411? Let me know hun
What's the 411?

Mary: What's the 411 hun?
