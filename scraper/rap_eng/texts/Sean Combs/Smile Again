[Chorus 1]
Smile again
Just smile again
I'll always be there for you
What can I do to make you smile again?
Just smile again

[Verse 1]
I'd like to know what's on your mind
Because I see you crying all the time
I don't understand
Who'd wanna hurt your heart like this
And cause you so much pain
Here's my shoulder
You can lean on me
I wanna see you happy

[Chorus 2]
I want to see you happy
Why not just let me make you smile again?
Just smile again
I'll always be there for you
What can I do to make you smile again?
Just smile again

[Verse 2]
Just wanna see you smile
How can I ease the pain you feel?
What can I do to take the tears away?
Baby, talk to me
You say he's hurt you many times
But now that's over, let me take his place
Your problems, I'll erase
You need someone that you can depend on
To brighten up every day
I am the one
That you've been searching for
And all you have to do is
Smile again

[Chorus 3]
Let me be the one
Let me be the one to make you smile
Just smile again
Just smile again
Let me be the one
Let me be the one to make you smile
Just smile again
Just smile again
Let me love you
I can show you
Just what it means to me
Please smile for me
Let me love you (let me be the one)
I can show you (let me be the one to make you smile)
Just what it means to me (smile again)
Please smile for me (just smile again)
Let me be the one
Let me be the one to make you smile
Just smile again
Just smile again
Let me love you
I can show you
Just what it means to me
Please smile for me
Let me be the one
Let me be the one to make you smile
Just smile again
Just smile again

[Outro]
I wanna see you happy
