[Chorus]
I'll show you love
More love, baby
It's all about the love I have in me
So baby, let me show you love
More love, baby
It's all about the love I have in me
So baby, let me show you love

[Verse 1]
Now, come with me to my hideaway
That's where you'll find me night and day
A place where we can get away
No one to stop us when we play

[Pre-Chorus]
Give you everything you need
Even get down on my knees
Just as long as you believe
Be with me and you'll succeed

[Chorus]
I'll show you love
More love, baby
It's all about the love I have in me
So baby, let me show you love
More love, baby
It's all about the love I have in me
So baby, let me show you love

[Verse 2]
Now, you can put your trust in me
Good loving will be guaranteed
As time goes by, you'll come to see
That you don't need no one but me

[Pre-Chorus]
Give you everything you need
Even get down on my knees
Just as long as you believe
Be with me and you'll succeed

[Chorus]
I'll show you love
More love, baby
It's all about the love I have in me
So baby, let me show you love
More love, baby
It's all about the love I have in me
So baby, let me show you love

[Bridge]
You'll never ever find a love like mine
And I gotta be with you all the time
I'll show you love

[Chorus]
I'll show you love
More love, baby
It's all about the love I have in me
So baby, let me show you love
More love, baby
It's all about the love I have in me
So baby, let me show you love
I'll show you love
More love, baby
It's all about the love I have in me
So baby, let me show you love
More love, baby
It's all about the love I have in me
So baby, let me show you love
I'll show you love
More love, baby
It's all about the love I have in me
So baby, let me show you love
More love, baby
It's all about the love I have in me
So baby, let me show you love
I'll show you love
More love, baby
It's all about the love I have in me
So baby, let me show you love
More love, baby
It's all about the love I have in me
So baby, let me show you love
