[Intro: Dessy Hinds]
Wooh
Uh, haha
It's a beautiful morning (Beautiful, beautiful)
Had to wipe the sweat off a little bit
Haha, yeah
Nasty on this shit, uh, wooh

[Verse: Dessy Hinds]
Crutches, crosses, caskets
Still in Brooklyn crossing traffic
Where you can count the fiends by the masses
Get pocket C.R.E.A.M then make it flip, gymnastics
It's all about backwoods,dropping bombers like NASA alpha jackets
Get off your mattress then, proceed to blast this
I heard  you got that fire nigga pass this
I heard you blasphemous
You can find me on the "Inglorious Bastard" list, with this new rapping grip a bunch of upcoming actresses
Crutches, crosses, caskets
He got that god flow
Young Pablo Picasso, paint pictures of Pac's throne
The plot longer than blocks longer in Crown Heights
How could they reach a nigga from ground-height?
What that sound like?
Crutches, crosses, caskets
I keep the gas lit, bunny heads in a basket, poof
That's black magic, nigga
Six pay figures is what im asking for
Two thousand and sixteen, they ready to blast me more
BLAOW
