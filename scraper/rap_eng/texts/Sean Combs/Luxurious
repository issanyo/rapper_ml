[Spoken Intro]
C'est pas possible cette amour
C'est incroyable
Tu me fais transpirer
C'est parfait

[Chorus]
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
The payback, the payback

[Verse 1]
Champagne kisses, hold me in your lap of luxury
I only wanna fly first-class desires
You're my limousine
So elegant, the way we ride
Our passion, it just multiplies
There's platinum lightning in the sky
Look, I'm livin' like a queen

[Pre-Chorus]
This kind of love is getting expensive
We know how to live, ba-by
We're luxurious, like Egyptian cotton
We're so rich in love, we're rollin', in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear, baby
Diamond in the rough, is lookin' so sparkly

[Chorus]
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
The payback, the payback

[Verse 2]
Sugar, honey, sexy baby
When we touch, it turns to gold
Sensitive and delicate, kinda like a tuberose
You know you are my treasure chest
It's pure perfection when we kiss and
You're my Mr., I'm your Ms
Gonna be until we're old

[Pre-Chorus]
This kind of love is getting expensive
We know how to live, ba-by
We're luxurious, like Egyptian cotton

[Chorus]
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
The payback, the payback
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback
The payback, the payback

[Bridge]
Cha-CHIIIIING, cha-CHIIIING
We're loaded and we're not gonna blow it
Cha-CHIIIIING, cha-CHIIIING
We're hooked up with the love 'cause we grow it
Cha-CHIIIIING, cha-CHIIIING
We got hydroponic love and we're smokin'
Cha-CHIIIIING, cha-CHIIIING
We burn it, you and I, we are so lit
We're so rich in love, we're rollin, in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear, baby
Diamond in the rough, is lookin' so sparkly

[Chorus]
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback (This is how we roll)
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back (Luxurious)
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback (Baby, we are so... ex-pen-sive ...oh)
The payback, the payback

[Spoken Outro]
T'es si jolie
C'est pas possible...
