[Intro]
I can remember when
We had, we had it all
You and I, you and I
Yeah

Let’s make the time tonight
Reminisce oh so right
Reminisce on the love we had
Make the time tonight

[Refrain 3X]
Let’s make the time tonight
Reminisce oh so right
Reminisce on the love we had
(When they reminisce over you, my God)
Make the time tonight

[Verse 1]
I know that we've been here before
The candle light and you walking softly through my door
Come on in my sweet, how have you been?
You're so nice, but tonight, we're gonna be more than just friends
I recall the days and ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we share each other
Don't you feel the magic? The mystery's in the air
Let's go down to lover's lane (with the love)
With the love we shared

[Chorus 2X]
Let's make the time tonight
While the feeling's right
Reminisce on the love we had
(When they reminisce over you, my God)

[Verse 2]
I can see you standing there alone
Like an angel trying to find his way home
I don't remember, how we fell apart
Here we are again, come on, fly into my heart
I recall the days and ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we share each other
Don't you feel the magic? The mystery's in the air
Let's go down to lover's lane (with the love)
With the love we shared

[Chorus 2X]
Let's make the time tonight
While the feeling's right
Reminisce on the love we had
(When they reminisce over you, my God)

[Rap: CL Smooth]
Yes, boo, you reminisce too, now peep it
Under B-boy here, I found Victoria’s Secret
My God, I’ll make your head nod when I come through
If it’s me you’re gonna do, you better work out, boo
So reminisce the caramel king, you know the Mecca don swing
Give you everything else but the ring
So déjà vu, tell you what I’m gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my God

[CL Smooth]
Yeah, CL Smooth and Mary J. Blige, on a rige
To reminisce and it goes like this, check it on out
(When they reminisce over you, my God)
Yeah, uh, feel the funk, baby
(When they reminisce over you, my God)
I reminisce, I reminisce

[Refrain with ad-libs (Repeat until end)]
Let’s make the time tonight
Reminisce oh so right
Reminisce on the love we had
(When they reminisce over you, my God)
Make the time tonight
