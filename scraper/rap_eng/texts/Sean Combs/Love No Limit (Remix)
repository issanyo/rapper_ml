[Intro: Kid Capri]
Once again, right before your eyes to no surprise
It’s the man upon two pieces of steel
It’s the Kid Capri, doing this one for Mary J. Blige
On the flip tip
So we gon’ take it Uptown with the remix
And y’all get down with me one time, you nam’sayin’
So here we go…

MJB: Yo Puff, I don’t think they ready for this one…

[Verse 1]
Baby, there's no need to tell you
As far as I can clearly recall
My love has been here for you
So you don't have to worry at all
I'll sacrifice my time
I'll make sure you're satisfied
And it's no hard thing to the joy I’ll bring
I wanna give you all my love, yeah

[Chorus]
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
(I’m loving you)
Don't you look no more, love without a limit
(Love without a limit)
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
(I’m loving you, boy)
Don't you look no more, love without a limit
You know, you know

[Verse 2]
Ooh baby, I'm in need of your love
And you’ve got that touch that I need so much
And I am about to explode
Freely, completely
Everything you want I'll be
Good love down to the last drop
And I'm not gonna stop

[Chorus]
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
Don't you look no more, love without a limit
(Take my hand and follow me)
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
(I’m loving you, boy)
Don't you look no more, love without a limit
You know, you know

Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
(I’m loving you)
Don't you look no more, love without a limit
(Don’t you look no, don’t you look no more)
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
(Every day)
Don't you look no more, love without a limit
(You don’t have to worry)
You know, you know

Said I’m loving you… (You don’t have to worry…)
Loving you every day (…’cause I’m loving you, boy)
Don't you look no more, love without a limit
(Said I’m love, said I’m loving)
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
(Said I’m loving you, boy)
Don't you look no more, love without a limit
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
Don't you look no more, love without a limit
You know, you know

[Bridge (over Chorus)]
Loving you is all I wanna do
Loving you is all I wanna do
Loving you is all I wanna do
Loving you is all I wanna do

[Chorus (Repeat until end)]
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
Don't you look no more, love without a limit
Said I’m loving you, loving you every day
Don't you look no more, love without a limit
You know, you know
