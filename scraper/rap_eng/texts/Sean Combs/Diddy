Yeah, it's Bad Boy, baby
Neptune's and we won't stop
Cause we can't stop
Yeah, let me tell you something
Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 1-2-5 and Saint Nich
Chillin' with these chick, named Tondalea
Was a hot girl and everybody wanted to slay her
She wasn't fond of players
Only wanted ballers to spoil her
Six figures and camcorders
So what you trying to tell me, dear
I got Bentley, Benz send in Mr. Belvedere
And I just want to blow your mind
I'm talkin' literally blow your mind
My repratoir is Menage Trois
And exotic cars chilling with the hottest stars
And it ain't no stop to this
I can't help it, I'm an optimist
And I'ma make ya head bop to this
And at the end you gon' rock to this
Now say my name
It's the D the I the D the D the Y
The D the I the D
It's Diddy, hold up, it's Diddy, that's crazy
It's the D the I the D the D the Y
The D the I the D
It's Diddy, hold up, it's Diddy, say what
Ay yo, I came in the door, I said it before
I never the ladiez hypnotize me no more
But, back to the manuscript
Cause I don't think you can handle this
From New York to Los Angles
I think the whole world scandalous
I'm just trying to keep the candles lit
Let the party people dance to this
Get out your seat and clap your hands to this
Because I came too far for me to be bouswar
It's a Bentley to you, to me it's a blue car
So Branson pass me a jar
Cause these cats done went too far
One phone call send two cars
And still get searched by security guards
I guess that's what I have to do
Take the game international
Now what you call me
It's the D the I the D the D the Y
The D the I the D
It's Diddy, hold up, it's Diddy, that's crazy
It's the D the I the D the D the Y
The D the I the D
It's Diddy, hold up, it's Diddy, say what
(La, la, la)
C'mon, work it out, girl
I'm trying to see you work it out, girl
(La, la, la)
C'mon, work it out, girl
I wanna see you work it out, girl
Now hold up, stop, now wait a minute
We don't stop we rock cause ain't a limit
My aim is winning, got Asian women
That'll change my linen after I done blazed and hit 'em
But I just wanna rock wit' you
And take it straight to the top with you
And do what I gots to do
If it's possible, cause I ain't trying to stop you boo
I got an agenda, got on a ninja
One wheelin' and killin' it not to offend ya
That's when I met this chick named Brenda
Tender, her whole body bend like fender
So let me see you shake it, girl
I just wanna see you shake it, girl
For the return of the don, the world in my palm
My mom calls me Sean but y'all call me
The D the I the D the D the Y
The D the I the D
It's Diddy, hold up, it's Diddy, that's crazy
The D the I the D the D the Y
The D the I the D
It's Diddy, hold up, it's Diddy, say what
(La, la, la)
C'mon, work it out, girl
I'm trying to see you work it out, girl
(La, la, la)
C'mon, work it out, girl
I wanna see you work it out, girl
