[Hook]
Looking for someone to love me
And now I’m looking for someone to love me

[Diddy - Verse 1]
My drama, my karma
My love my life, dear drama
The war's I've fought, scars that I've garnered
The hustle, I got that honest from my father
Mix me with violence, blend me with peace
Combine me with hate and I can't face defeat (nope)
I did it all in a week
Still incomplete as I stand on my feet
It take a lot to still dance to the beat
Skin more cold and callous than concrete
I love swimming but theres just one ski
In a rich man's hotel with bed sheets
Uh ah, you know what I'm looking for

[Hook]
Looking for someone to love me
And now I’m looking for someone to love me

[Diddy - Verse 2]
When you ain't got dough, you scratch and you crawl
In you state of mind, you want somethin', ay you want it all
Look at the sky wonder when its gon fall
Cry in the rain so the pain is stalled
Its too dark, my World is in doom
Just cold, my soul howls at the moon
My mind spins, my sins crowd the room
My heart don't skip it just beats out of tune
I can't even hold down food I'm so rude
Bad attitude, what point I got to prove
Sometimes to win something you gotta lose
Love ain't there my is just bruise

[Hook]
Looking for someone to love me
And now I’m looking for someone to love me

[Diddy - Verse 3]
I'm impatient, I'm so vacant
I'm so real with myself, I'm so blatant
I thirst more, I'm far from complacent
Always placing my heart last I'm paper chasing
Left craving the warmth of one touch
So whats money if oyu never had enough
I'm disgusted, people say I'm not to be trusted
Insomnia driven, my eyes crusted
So come and save my life if you can muster up
Enough strength to show me how to love somebody besides myself
I crave comfort, stars may align just right for us, start a new life for us
Build a fortress beyond coffins
Rembrandt, we paint our soulmates portraihts
Come one you know just what I'm looking for

[Hook]
Looking for someone to love me
And now I’m looking for someone to love me
