[Verse 1: Cousin Stizz]
Like two times looking they rewound it back
This remind me when we ran around and black
Tryna steal my wave you prolly drown in that
Smoking with my bro he's like what's sound is that?
Niggas lying prolly run a mile with that
Every couple weeks i blow a pound of gas
Bread all in my pocket, that allowance cash
Cold where i'm from there where the scoundrels at
Niggas snitching then what kind of style is that?
Yeah we struggle but i kept my smile intact
Looking for the money till i hound it back
Got my and my niggas richer ain't no proud in that
Yeah
Don't want trouble don't stop(don't stop)
Down here and yeah you gotta have heart
And i'm still cooling in the park
But i got a master plan
That shoot us right up to the top
And it don't stop

[Hook: Cousin Stizz]
Really down like that
Really down
Really down like that
You ain't around
Cause you ain't down like that
Really down
Ain't really down like that

I'm really down
Really down like that
Really down
Really down like that
You ain't around
Cause you ain't down like that
Really down
Ain't really down like that

[Verse 2: Larry June]
Bitch you know i bang the fucking mob (shit damn mob)
Catch a nigga slipping, homocide
I just counted my hammers i got nine
Ay punk bitches blow a, nigga high
If the rap don't work fuck it back to selling base rock
I had two bimmers coups way before the fucking tape drop
I know i'm rapping offbeat fuck hip hop nigga goddamn
223's and the M80 even when the nigga outta town
Chopper make a body rock. you ain't really living what you rapping 'bout?
Niggas swaggerjacking, tryna duplicate, make me wanna pull them hammers out
Nowadays niggas only thuggin on the internet, they just Twitter body
Even in the summertime real niggas still keep their heat on 'em
(Hey sweetheart hand me that motherfucking tape darling)
Bitch you know you ain't really goes down like that
You a house nigga you ain't round like that
I'm so fucking high i lost and found the pack
I say fuck the sports game but I still ball like Shaq
Goddamn, good job Larry, shit

[Hook: Cousin Stizz]

Yeah
Is going down like that
You ain't around
Cause you ain't down like that
Really down
Ain't really down like that

I'm really down
Really down like that
I'm really down
Really down like that
You ain't around
Cause you ain't down like that
Really down
Ain't really down like that
