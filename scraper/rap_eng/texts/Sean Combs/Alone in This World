[Verse 1]
It's over now, I can't compete
I don't know how I'm still standing on my feet
So turned around and incomplete
I'm not that happy woman that I used to be
Oh, please tell me what did you mean
When you said that you were mine, you knew that was a line
But in your heart, you know the truth
And I'm trying to forget
All the things you put me through, oh baby

[Chorus]
I never thought you'd turn your back
And walk away from love like that
While I was holding on to you
All you did was let me go
I never thought I would regret
The way I felt when we first met
And now I'm standing here
Alone in this world, alone

[Verse 2]
It's over now, we can't go on
In my eyes I thought that you could do no wrong
It's no surprise we both belong
Because of you my heart's singing a sad song
Oh, please tell me what did you mean
When you said that you were mine, you knew that was a line
But in your heart you know the truth
And I'm trying to forget
All the things you put me through, oh baby

[Chorus]
I never thought you'd turn your back
And walk away from love like that
While I was holding on to you
All you did was let me go
I never thought I would regret
The way I felt when we first met
And now I'm standing here
Alone in this world, alone

[Bridge]
I can't believe our love is over now
Where did love go? (Tell me where did love go)
And why did I believe that we would be together forever
Now it's all a memory

[Chorus]
I never thought you'd turn your back
And walk away from love like that
While I was holding on to you
All you did was let me go
I never thought I would regret
The way I felt when we first met
And now I'm standing here
Alone in this world, alone
I never thought you'd turn your back
And walk away from love like that
While I was holding on to you
All you did was let me go
I never thought I would regret
The way I felt when we first met
And now I'm standing here
Alone in this world, alone
I never thought you'd turn your back
And walk away from love like that
While I was holding on to you
All you did was let me go...
