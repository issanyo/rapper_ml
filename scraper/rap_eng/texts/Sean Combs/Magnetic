[Verse]
You must has hella worth
The way you're moving front
Unless you're living to your rhythm
Then get naked because
If you got my language
Geriatric fantasy
And everything that you're doing it just runs back to me

[Pre-Hook]
I'm feeling delight
Disconnected intertwined
Your somewhere on my mind
And when you're choking on me
I'm so in ecstasy

[Hook]
Soon as I hit the floor
You stay and wait in doubt
My bodies going wild next to yours
I'm just so magnetic
Energy so strong
Feelings I can't prolong
Forces don't make it right
So magnetic

[Pre-Hook]
I'm feeling delight
Disconnected intertwined
Your somewhere on my mind
You rained on me
Slowly and sexily yeah

[Hook]
Soon as I hit the floor
You stay and wait in doubt
My bodies going wild next to yours
I'm just so magnetic
Energy so strong
Feelings I can't prolong
Forces don't make it right
So magnetic

[Bridge]
Yeah the streets are complex
Suck me in like vortex
I'm gravitating to you (To you)
You come to me
You come to me

[Hook]
Soon as I hit the floor
You stay and wait in doubt
My bodies going wild next to yours
I'm just so magnetic
Energy so strong
Feelings I can't prolong
Forces don't make it right
So magnetic

[Ending Hook]
Soon as I hit the floor
You stay and wait in doubt
My bodies going wild next to yours
I'm just so magnetic
Energy so strong
Feelings I can't prolong
Forces don't make it right
So magnetic
Sucking me in like a vortex
