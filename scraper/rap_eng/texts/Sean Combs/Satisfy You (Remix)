Lil Kim:
THIS IS THE REMIX
As we procede, to give you what you need
2000 muthafuckas, get loud muthafuckas

Chorus-
Mario Winans, (Puff Daddy), [Lil Kim], {Ronald Isley}
1 -
(I'm the light when you can't see
I'm the air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
It won't stop)
2 -
[I like this, yeah this is the remix]

Ohhh, anything you want I'm gonna give it to you girl
Along aside your body, make you open up your world
I wanna satisfy you, {Satisfy, satisfy}
I wanna satisfy you. (1) [2]
Baby tell me can we fuck all through the night (can we fuck?)
Lick your body up and down
Make you feel alright {I can almost taste you}
I wanna satisfy you, (1) {I wanna satisfy you, wanna satisfy you}
I wanna satisfy you. [2]

Puff Daddy (Mario):
I wanna hit the four seasons, lie with you
Roll backward, get high with you
Let the jet fall out the sky, die with you
Rock minx and stay fly with you, (ooohhh)
Bonny and Clyde, ghetto bride
Push my love aside, get you right
It ain't physical, it's spiritual
Make a nigga feel like he went to heaven and died (heaven and died)
C'mon
Gangsta love, love how we chill together
And we reachin Brazil together, [2]
Count mills together
Niggas front, get ill together
Playas hate, but we still together
A name, for me to praise
To my dyin days, and I see the grave
True love, me and you love, [2]
So whatchu wanna do love?

Chorus (with slight different adlibs)

Puff Daddy (Puff Daddy):
You make me feel like
I've been locked down for years
And ain't had none
Strictly magnon
Walk around the room neked (naked), and make dragon
Gangsta sarcasm, (That's right)
Ask who's pussy is this? (Who's pussy is this?)
Multi orgasms, catchin back spasms, [woman moaning]
High off ex (ecstacy), rough sex, just so much, take that. [2]
Plus together, nothin better
Uncomparable, can't measure, (can't measure)
What I feel for you, my treasure
There through it all, thick and thin, take the pressure
Come, real bitch, feel this, real love, what an affair
My love, there to the nair (near). [2]

Chorus -

Lil Kim (Puff Daddy):
How you want me baby?
Butt naked on some rug shit?
Or thugged out on some Cryps and some Bloods shit
It's your call, the queen do it all
Anything you do for me, I do 10 times more
Forget the small talk, let me sit on your face
Rockin moves like a hoola hoop around my waist
Pushin fantasies, can I fulfill your wish
Bet it's me with some niggas, or me with a bitch. [2]
Whooo! Whooo! Time to get freaky, freaky
Get my Price cd, do me babyy
(Kim, I think you're the one for me
Let's get married so you can have a son for me.)
Not now baby, stick your tongue in me
Make me feel good, I might let you cum in me
The way you call me mommy, ooh I love it, [2]
Make me wanna go public
Tell the whole world that I'm your girl
Take pictures with our moms on the cover of New York Times
Grew up bad, just like his mom and dad
A real nigga is all I want, all I ever had
Things you do, give a bitch to choose
Like writing out "I Love You" in hundered dollar bills
Feed each other fruits like kiwi and mango
Rock kangos, while we do the durango
And when we fight, we both get bruised
Lie to everybody, say they matchin tattoos
My nigga got beef, ain't shit you can tell me
I cut a nigga's throat like Shaquita from Bellarmy
I wanna house in Africa, ??? in my back yard
Businesses surrounded by security guards
With a big ass club called "Kim n Him"
And a crew full of dollars I can go spend with him

Chorus to fade
