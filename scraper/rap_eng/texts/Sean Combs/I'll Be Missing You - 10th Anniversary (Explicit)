Yeah  this right here (tell me why)
Goes out to everyone that has lost someone
That they truly loved (c'mon check it out)

[Verse 1]
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track you locked the flow
So far from hanging on the block for dough
Notorious they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be (uh-uh)
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone we still a team
Through your family I'll fulfill your dream (that's right)
In the future can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time the night they took my friend (uh-huh)
Try to black it out but it plays again
When it's real feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living your life after death

[Chorus]
Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day when you went away
What a life to take what a bond to break
I'll be missing you
(I miss you Big)

[Verse 2]
It's kinda hard with you not around (yeah)
Know you in heaven smilin' down
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you friend
Memories give me the strength I need (uh-huh) to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the 6 shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me taking flicks
Makin' hits stages they receive you on
I still can't believe you're gone (can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living you're life after death

[Chorus]
Every step I take, every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day when you went away
What a life to take what a bond to break
I'll be missing you
(Somebody tell me why)

On that morning
When this life is over
I know, I'll see your face

(Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray, every step I take)
Every day that passes
(Every move I make every single day)
Is a day that I get closer
To seeing you again
(Every night I pray every step I take)
We miss you Big... and we won't stop
(Every move I make every single day)
Cause we can't stop...
That's right
(Every night I pray every step I take
Every move I make every single day)
We miss you Big

[Chorus]
Every step I take every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinking of the day when you went away
What a life to take what a bond to break
I'll be missing you (we miss you)
Every step I take every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day every time I pray
I'll be missing you (I'll be missing you)
Thinking of the day (thinking of the day) when you went away
What a life to take what a bond to break
I'll be missing you

Every step I take (on that morning) every move I make (when this life is over)
Every single day every time I pray
I'll be missing you (I know, I'll see your face)

Thinking of the day (on that morning) when you went away
