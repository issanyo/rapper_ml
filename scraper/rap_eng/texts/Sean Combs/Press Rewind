(Keisha)
I think you need to think back
When we were sexin' each other
Tell me what you wanna do
Tell me

(Pam)
Say you don't wanna press rewind
Think back to the times
Where sexin' me was the only thing on your mind
Look me eye to eye
And tell me you don't want
What you used to get tonight
Boy I remember just what you like
And for you boy
Been keepin' it nice n tight
Waitin' for this moment to come with you
So press rewind, to use mine
And tell me what you wanna do

Chorus

Press rewind
Give it to me again and again
Askin' what you say baby
What you wanna do?
Just unwind
And what you say baby
Give it to me again and again
Say what you wanna do do

Press rewind
Give it to me again and again
Askin' what you say baby
What you wanna do?
Just unwind
And what you say baby
Give it to me again and again
Say what you wanna do do

(Pam)
I've mastered all that you told me
Unrelease those curious thoughts, concieved
Three times a freak
You need to press rewind
To think of all the things I used to do to you
(Just unwind yeah yeah)
To find out all the things I've learned
Think about the last night
Then tell me what you wanna do

Chorus

Press rewind
Give it to me again and again
Askin' what you say baby
What you wanna do?
Just unwind
And what you say baby
Give it to me again and again
Say what you wanna do do

Press rewind
Give it to me again and again
Askin' what you say baby
What you wanna do?
Just unwind
And what you say baby
Give it to me again and again
Say what you wanna do do

Bridge

Baby tonight
We're gonna do all the things you want me to
Let's take our time
Never ever wanna let you go
Give it to me nice and slow
You'll never forget
Cause I can after I do my job
You are mine
So press rewind
And think of me
I want you to think of me

Chorus

Press rewind
Give it to me again and again
Askin' what you say baby
What you wanna do?
Just unwind
And what you say baby
Give it to me again and again
Say what you wanna do do

Press rewind

Askin' what you say baby
What you wanna do?
Just unwind
And what you say baby
Give it to me again and again
Say what you wanna do do

Again and again
Press rewind
Girl do you remember
When you were mine
That I loved you
And you loved me
Let's start over
This is how it should be

Again and again
Press rewind
Girl do you remember
When you were mine

And you loved me
Let's start over
This is how it should be
