Chorus:
Baby can we spend some time
But if only for one night
I wanna be together, I wanna be with you
(repeat x2)

Verse one:
All of my days and nights
I spend dreaming of us together
I never realised how much of my time
Goes to thinking of you
You're all that's on my mind

Repeat chorus

Verse two:
I wanna talk to you

About the things that we can do
Is that alright with you?
Can we work this out
I need to be sure
That you understand what love is all about

Repeat chorus

Bridge:
All my days, and all my nights
I wanna be with you tonight
Baby can we spend some time
I wanna be with you
(repeat x2)

Repeat chorus and bridge to fade
