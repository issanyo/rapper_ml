[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Throw your hands in the sky, nigga

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I'm stickin' ice picks on the tip of ya dick
Give your testicles a swift kick, ain't that some shit?
Am I hard hard core? Harder than the Plymouth
It ain't no myth, it's a nigga with a spliff
And a chrome four fifth pressed on ya back
So what you want, nigga? How you wanna act?
I hope civilized cause I love to see niggas die
Brains all leakin' out on the street
And the pastor preachin' "He was a good man."
Played the bad man when the burner was in his hand
Now he's singin' sad songs with Elvis
Three to the head, bout six cross the pelvis
You fuck with the high guy, ya die
Yeah the same motherfucker yellin' "Look up in the sky!"
I'm on some old neck shit, Suplex shit
Hardcore sex shit, and Tec shit

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Girl]
Whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uh, uh
A repetitive loop all I need to destroy
A soloist or group, huh, I put it to ya boy
Hope you got the scoop, Biggie Smalls, the rap genius
I keep the Glock by the penis
The cleanest cut, fuck the sluts with the big
Humongous butts, huh, I use a rubber, but
My style is gushy like the hooker's pussy
And it don't take a lot of back talk to push me
Into flamin' 'em like that little nigga Damien
Pop 19 to my motherfuckin' cranium
Game tight, gun totin' motherfucker
Niggas in the grave thought Biggie was a sucker
I tricked 'em- I gave 'em work then I sticked 'em
I stripped 'em, 'cause niggas don't want the friction
Told you before how I bring the dra-ma
Slam Larry Johnson and his Grandma-ma

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Girl]
Whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?

[Diddy]
Aye yo
Time to reunite 'em
Yeah

[Verse 3: Jay Z (The Notorious B.I.G.)]
It's the Commission, niggas
B-I-G lives on
No more music, Brooklyn
Uh, uh, uh, uh, Let's go!
It's fuckin' deadly

Lucky Lefty of the Commission, bow down
By now you fuckers know this is our crown
Bucktown bullies, Brooklyn Biggie
Bedstuy Hov like Bedstuy Gold
Behold the fly-est (the Commission)
Bentley drivers, Louis Vuitton buyers
Jet fuel abusers, sippin' Petrus
Once Upon A Time In America's muse
You based on us, you fiction
Ya eight's don't bust, you a constant contradiction
Ladies please use contraception
Conception's at a all time high with sexin'
Use protection
You fuckers shoulda never been born, shoulda never got signed
How the fuck you got on?
How the fuck you got Shawn?
I'm too advanced, the Lance Armstrong of the dance
Rubberband man before T.I. was
King of New York like B.I. was
B.K. all day, it's in my blood
You wanna see my mask and gloves?
What the fuck you want?

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Girl]
Whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?
Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?

[Outro: Diddy]
Two of the world's greatest
Brooklyn's Finest
The Commission lives on
BIG Forever
The Biggie Duets
Let's go
