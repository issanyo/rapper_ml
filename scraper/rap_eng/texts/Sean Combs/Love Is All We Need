Chorus:
Love is all we need
It is the key that holds us together now
I need to know what you want
I need to know what you need
Baby can't you see, this is for you and me

Verse one:
Take a look around at what we have, yeah
How could I help you understand
I'm trying to figure out what love is all about

Repeat chorus

Verse two:
I can't do this on my own
Being together makes it easier than for us to be alone
I need you babe, to show signs that you really care

Bridge:
And if you have any doubts
I'll help you work them out
There's no need to fear, I'm here
'cos that's what love's all about

Repeat chorus to fade

Break:
Just a little love, love is all we need
Take a look around, baby can't you stay with me?
I need to know, oh baby can't you see?

I want to know what you want
I really want to know what you need
Baby, baby, baby

Repeat break
