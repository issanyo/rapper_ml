We've, got a message in the music...
And we, know exactly how to use it...
A message comin' from the soul...
Want you to listen young and old...
We're not just writing any song...
That you can dance to all night long...
Please correct me if i'm wrong...
But this music is a strong...
Way for us to communicate...
I gotta let it have it's way...

Let it take you to a place...
Only music can provide...
Let it make you feel as if..
You can really touch the sky!
