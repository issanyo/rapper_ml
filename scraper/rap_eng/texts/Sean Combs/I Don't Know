[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
All my niggas, take a walk with me
You ain't gotta holla, you can talk with me
Just try to learn where my thoughts can be and how I stack figures
Learn why I'm real, still that nigga
I get money, I ain't gotta do a crime
Shit, I hit dimes, what I need with a nine
Before y'all judge me, be clear
We got nothing but heat here, beware, we here
What's my name? Got chicks twisted, like, what's my game?
Pimp things still the same
I smash it, I don't harass it
Ma, I'm a baller, I score and pass it
Feel me, still be filthy
If making hits is a crime, I plead guilty
And this is what we came do
Party, Diddy, Usher, game is through, come on

[Verse 2: Usher]
It's right around eleven o'clock
One of your girls just called
Asked you how you look, are you ready?
You tell her you look hot
Not to worry at all
Niggas will be shook, y'all doing it heavy
She's telling you she might change
But you tell her not to
She know that she looks stunning, it'll be fun
The club will be full of game
But none of that has got you
Me, I think you're running 'cause I'm the one
You see...

[Chorus: Usher]
I don't know what you came to do, girl
What you came to do tonight
But I came to party, oh
I don't know what you came to do, girl
What you came to do tonight
But I came to party, oh

[Bridge: Usher]
You're probably thinking to yourself, what's the occasion?
And believe me, girl, I don't just sex for fun
I'm the perfect gentleman in every situation
And the only thing that's missing is the one
Is it you?

[Chorus: Usher]
I don't know what you came to do, girl (Say what?)
What you came to do tonight
But I came to party, oh
I don't know what you came to do, girl
What you came to do tonight
But I came to party, oh

[Interlude: Usher & Pharrell Williams]
Check this out, sing it (la, la, la)
Ghetto girls (la, la, la)
Suburban girls (la, la, la)
International girls, you smell me? (la, la, la, la)
(La, la, la)
Ghetto girls (la, la, la)
Suburban girls (la, la, la)
International girls, you smell me? (la, la, la, la)

[Verse 3: Usher]
Had to take the time
To open up your mind
That's exactly what you are: open
You got the memorizing grind
Your shape should be a crime
Damn baby you're a star, you're smoking

[Bridge: Usher]
You're probably thinking to yourself, what's the occasion?
And believe me, girl, I don't just sex for fun
I'm the perfect gentleman in every situation
And the only thing that's missing is the one
Is it you, yeah?

[Chorus: Usher]
I don't know what you came to do, girl
What you came to do tonight
But I came to party
I don't know what you came to do, girl
What you came to do tonight
But I came to party

[Interlude: Usher & Pharrell Williams]
Sing it (la, la, la)
Ghetto girls (la, la, la)
Suburban girls (la, la, la)
International girls, you smell me? (la, la, la, la)
(La, la, la)
Ghetto girls (la, la, la)
Suburban girls (la, la, la)
International girls, you smell me? (la, la, la, la)

[Outro: Usher & Pharrell Williams]
It's real serious
You're so fine, girl
At the end of the day, I'm going home with you
I don't know what you came to do, girl
What you came to do tonight (you're so fine, girl)
But I came to party (at the end of the day, I'm going home with you)
