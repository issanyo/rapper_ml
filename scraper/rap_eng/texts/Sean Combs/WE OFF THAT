[Diddy - "O Let's Do It"]
I got my billions up, fuckin' with them white folks
Now I don't give a fuck, cause I'm richer than them white folks
Lamborghini trucks, y'all ain't even seen it yet
Bought me Teterboro just to Diddy bop and land my jet
I'm hustlin out of Harlem, Paulie Castellano
Bitch, I am a problem, I just bought the Delano
Pimpin in my convo, bitches come in combos
Pictures of Christopher on my wall all in my condo
I don't fuck with fake hoes, all I touch is J-Lo's
All I drink is my shit, Ciroc by the case load
Movies is my next shit, two mil on my necklace
Bad Boy, 80 million motherfuckin' records

[Rick Ross - "O Let's Do It"]
I fucked my money up, I bought another Rolls Royce
To pick my homies up, my top back like Po Boy
Step yo' game up, you ridin' nigga, hold on
I switched the game up, one stack that's for the whole zone
That's thirty-six a kilo, bitch, I think I'm Nino
Bitch, I think I'm Scarface, bitch, I'm Al Pacino
Flippin my lil' C-notes, painted my new Benzo
Took my bitch to Red Lobster, I can't feed no friends, though
Bitch, I'm on my high horse, jewels I rock I die for
Cause that shit that I bought, shoot yo' ass that's my fault
Bitch, I'm on this asphalt, money makin' be the thing

Call me Waka Flocka, AKA Young Wild Nigga
AKA Young Drug Dealer
Got purp, got kush, got pills, got white
In the trap all night, with the hard and soft
Stacks on the flo', watch {?} boy whip it
Shook it to the left then he shook it to the right
So Icey, Brick Boys, got it all night

Kick in my door, we gon' shoot out all night

[Gucci Mane - "O Let's Do It"]

I'm countin cash in my office, sippin coffee with my feet up
Haters sendin threats, like they want beef but dey know dey don't

They locked my homeboy Verne up, 1999 for murder
Now niggas claiming Zone 6, that I ain't never heard of

We don't even go out, all she do is ho out
I don't even know her and I fucked her, what you know 'bout that
See all she know is Roscoe got them racks
Now my meat's between her buns like a fuckin' Big Mac
And everytime she place her order, I be there to deport her
I get heads and tails like both sides of the quarter

So you prolly couldn't afford er
But every time I see her it's crunch time, like we in the fourth quarter, and I'm gone

[Hook 2]
