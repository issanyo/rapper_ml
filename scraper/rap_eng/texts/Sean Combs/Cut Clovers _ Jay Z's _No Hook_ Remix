[Remix of Jay Z's "No Hook", produced by Puff Daddy, Sean C & LV]

Nobody gets justice
People only get good luck, or bad luck

[1st Verse]
Loved it, back then, I thought my fate would change
My life's just an ugly day, the cause of my pain
They told me, boy be hopeful, keep hoping
You only got one life, get the best of her
And love her, and show her
She's your queen, be a king and let her conquer
Boy get doper, boy get over your low profile
Get an ego for yourself and let everybody know it
Checkmate, over, my mind changed orbit
Yours tries to profit, mine is my foeman
My logic left me an orphan, I don't feel, like I'm on morphine
I'm so dope I lack endorphins
Dopamine made me a monster

[1st Bridge]
And a closure will bring us fortune
But the question is what you owe us
Pay with your blood for what you told us
Pay for luck and then you got us
Never cut flowers, better cut clovers
Irish legends haunt us, fortune seeking mobsters
Responses on their forearms
Luck didn't stay on their both laps
So they lost it
And got lost

[2nd Verse]
Got it, life is tough, no luck is deserved
Never really asked for much, only respect and success
Years passed, years will come, still be standing here
I was taught how to walk, but made no step ahead
Don't bury me, burn me, when that day arrives
Married with the journey just like Odysseus
Let my death be Ithaca, omega is my alpha
The edge is getting sharper, please excuse my sins
I came to the dead end, pencil my best friend, my sun became crescent, my light aims to sizzle
All games over, my time is up
Blind like Homer, missed my last chance
And today I'll be sorry, tomorrow I'm gon' feel it
Yesterday I've been wrong, you'll never forgive me
No matter of luck, it's eternal recurrence
Live my life back to back with no final cadence
Dumb bliss, she's an actress, plays a role in darkness
Plays with you, gets through you, to kill you in silence
Be happy or be clever, you can't choose both
Live now or live forever, tell me which one's worse
Wake up, do things, sleep, then repeat
That's life, that's luck, that's bliss, that's me
What a way to suffer, why even be living
In heaven and in life all interested is missing

[2nd Bridge]
And a closure will bring us fortune
But the question is what you owe us
Pay with your blood for what you told us
Pay for luck and then you got us
Never cut flowers
You'll be better cutting clovers
