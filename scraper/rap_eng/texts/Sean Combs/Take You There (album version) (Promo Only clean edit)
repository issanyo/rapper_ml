(feat. Diddy)

[Diddy:]
Close your eyes [echo]
Relax your mind [echo]
Fantasize [echo]
Come with me [echo]

[Donnie:]
If you want to go far... far
Let me take you to the stars... the stars
(I'm goin take you there)
We don't even need a car... a car
If you want to go to Mars... to Mars
(I'm goin take you there)
Have you ever seen the clouds up close?
Take a deep breath, baby let's go
(I'm goin take you there)
What's your desire
I'm your supplier
I'll get you higher
When you're ready to go
(Baby let me know cause girl I promise I can take you there)
(I'll take you there)
When you're ready to go
(Baby let me know cause girl I promise I can take you there)
(I'll take you there)
(I'm goin take you there)

Baby
You can play Lois Lane
When you need me I can be your Superman
(Be your superman)
Lazy lovers love will let you spread your wings
While you're sleepin you'll be calling out my name
(Donnie)

If you want to go far... far
Let me take you to the stars... the stars
We don't even need a car... a car
If you want to go to Mars... to Mars

When you're ready to go?
(Baby let me know cause girl I promise I can take you there)
(I'll take you there)
When you're ready to go
(Baby let me know cause girl I promise I can take you there)
(I'll take you there)
When you're ready to go

I can picture you and me
Makin love above the breeze
We'll be lying on the clouds
We don't plan on coming down
It's the place where we were low
Even though the stars are gone
Let's go, let's go, let's go

[Diddy:]
Excuse me lady, how you doin
Have my baby
I'm just screwin around I'm crazy
Baby girl I'm night and dayin
Taste you girl, don't stop your lovin
Everytime you stop the frontin
I'll pop your oven
You should in fact stay
Could be that way
I'm good in that way
Hood in that way
I'll be your lover, your favorite color
We outerspacing, we breathe each other
Your in a tantra
I got the answer
I'll twist you back up, It's hard to stand up
I'm yours it's on, yes baby girl you're fucking with Sean
Ride with a don, foreign languages, let's play Pong
Take off your outfit and let's be gone

[Donnie:]
Girl I got you in the zone, in the zone
So far girl I swear your mind is blown, mind is blown
Did your heart just skip a beat, skip a beat
So high up I know it's hard to breath

When you're ready to go
(Baby let me know cause girl I promise I can take you there)
(I'll take you there)
Now when you're ready to go
(Baby let me know cause girl I promise I can take you there)
(I'll take you there)
When you're ready to go
(I'll take you there, don't you be scared, I'm goin take you there)
When you're ready to go
Just close your eyes, you're in for a ride
(I'm goin take you there, I'm goin take you there, b-a-b-y)
