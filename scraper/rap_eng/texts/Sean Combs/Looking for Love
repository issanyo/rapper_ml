[Intro: Usher]
This is a JLack track, man
She says she's looking for love
You know we have to do it again, right?
All the girls in the club know what's up
She said she undercover though
And this is what she want

[Verse 1: Diddy]
She's got me higher in this mother fucker
She's got me flying in this mother fucker
Ready to die up in this mother fucker
Got damn, she badder than a mother fucker
Let's make a movie!
Two superstars
To big body coupes
Avatars
The marriage niggas stay and they e-condo large
I stay in Louis bed spurs camouflage
Let's go!

[Verse 2: Usher]
She wants the finer things and all that she can get from me
She even wants the lovely cutie on my arm
She get it in all way turned up
She a rider
She says she's in the mood for love

[Pre-Hook: Usher]
Watch out that girl is trouble!
They ain't got nothing on her
Can't even fight her hunger
She a get it girl, watch her do her thing
What she's got she got from her mother?
She super straight body shaped like no other
She's making her way to my area
And when she gets past security

[Hook: Usher  & amp;Diddy]
I say:
Hello! Welcome to my table!
Bring your girlfriends
Everything's paid for..
We gone get it in
Ain't that what you came for
Heard you was looking for me!
She say she looking for love
And all the girls in the club
Know what's up
She says she under cover though
And this is what she wants!

[Verse 3: Diddy]
Straight off the concord, two cheers and encore
Nice sweats, she feens for one boy
The innovator, young Sean combs
Reminiscing me and biggie bringing broads home
Father figure, hating for them other niggas
Dirty money went and brought a money printer
Now my money longer on the Mississippi river
Money making extraordinary!
I am the nigga

[Pre-Hook & Hook:]

[Interlude: Diddy]
Yo Usher
Talk to her!

[Bridge: Usher]
I... I know just what you liked!
I... I wanna make you feel good inside!
Girl if you just give me a little bit..
I know you gone love it
I... I know you wanna try
I.... I'm the only thing on her mind
Tonight... she's mine, oh mine

[Hook: Diddy & Usher]
Hello! Welcome to my table!
Bring your girlfriends
Everything's paid for..
We gone get it in
Ain't that what you came for
Heard you was looking for me!
She say she looking for love
And all the girls in the club
Know what's up
She says she under cover though
And this is what she wants
