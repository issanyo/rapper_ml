[Intro]
[Keri:] Baby I'm a Million (A Million)
[Trina:] Ayo Diddy
[Diddy:] Ayo Trina, I need a million dollar girl
[Trina:] (laughs)
[Diddy:] I gotchu
[Trina:] I gotchu

[Chorus (x2): Keri Hilson]
Baby if you want it, I got it
Cause I'll be gettin' some more
I'm a million dollar girl for sure
I'm a million dollar Girl
Baby I'm a million, a million

[Verse 1: Trina]
You know big money I get dat
Got my feet up when I kick back
Gettin' major brands for my chit chat
Got Miss Keri baby on this track
What colours in this season?
Think I'll go tear up [?]
Miami in the mornin', be in St Tropez this evenin'
I know you like my style, my million dollar smile
Hit any party red carpet, bet I shut that down
Don't hate just go get yours
No excuses no more
I just dropped another hit
Coz I'm that million dollar chick

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2: P. Diddy]
I'm off in another world, so far out this atmosphere
I could throw a hundred million out the cockpit of my layer
That's dirty money (uh uh)
You starving hungry (that's right)
I got a million in singles
Take it all of, shake it for me
No renting, my millions hydro-planed
And I'm done with St Tropez'ng
In my lambo ice coat painted
I'm richer than all the riches in the world
You ain't no could be and I ain't tryna buy you
I'm tryna slide you, how about them Gucci?

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3: Trina]
He shower me in diamonds, I vacation for months
Penthouse at the Trump, In Las Vegas I'm Lady Love
Million dollar swell, I know I got you feinding
These shades is YSL
These heels ain't out till next season
I'm in that pink Ferrari, I got a thing for Porsches
I like my men like my cars, strong and built like horses
Glass of [?], I'm far from aver-age
Rich and lavish, that's why I am the baddest bitch

[Chorus]
