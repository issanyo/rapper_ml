[Chorus]
Is it a game that we're playing?
It seems like the cloudy days
Keep coming in my life, oh oh
Is it a game that we're playing?
You don't understand
Your love is taking over me

[Verse 1]
I know you wonder why I sometimes cry
When I should be happy (I should be happy)
To have you in my life (whoa, whoa)
But you don't understand the changes I've been going through
Just to be happy
I need you by my side
(baby, just spend some time)

[Chorus]
Is it a game that we're playing?
It seems like the cloudy days
Keep coming in my life
(baby, take the rain away)
Is it a game that we're playing?
You don't understand
Your love is taking over me

[Verse 2]
So many times we said we'd try to make it right
But so many other things are getting in the way (in the way)
All we got to do is lean on each other to make it happen
There's nothing more left to say
(nothing that we can say)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm going crazy
Trying to do it by myself
But I really need your help
Baby, please (oh baby, please) listen to me
I'm down on my knees (yeah)
Baby, please (yeah) don't walk away (oh)

[Chorus]
Is it a game that we're playing?
(baby, don't let it be a game)
It seems like the cloudy days
Keep coming in my life
Is it a game that we're playing?
(...you just don't understand...)
You don't understand
Your love is taking over me
(...that I love you, baby, yes I do)
Is it a game that we're playing?
(I don't let it be a game)
It seems like the cloudy days
Keep coming in my life
(take the rain away, yeah yeah)
Is it a game that we're playing?
(don't let it be a game)
You don't understand
Your love is taking over me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm going crazy
Trying to do it by myself
But I need your help
Baby, please (oh baby, please) listen to me
I'm down on my knees (yeah)
Baby, please (yeah), give it a chance

[Outro]
Baby, I love you
And I want you to know (I just want you to know)
If you love me, baby (love me, baby)
Just let your feelings show (oh yeah, yeah)
Baby, I love you (baby, I love you)
And I want you to know (and I want you to know)
If you love me, baby (that if you love me, if you love me)
Just let your feelings show (oh...)
Baby, I love you (baby, I love you)
And I want you to know (and I want you to know)
If you love me, baby (if you love me, if you love me)
Just let your feelings show (I'll make you happy...)
Baby, I love you (I'll make you happy...)
And I want you to know (...every day of your life)
If you love me, baby (if you love me, baby)
Just let your feelings show
