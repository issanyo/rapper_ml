{Jay-Z Intro}
Old school, new school need to know this
I burn like *Rest In Peace*
I burn faster than gas in mopeds
Jigga Man, BK shit ???
Jigga Man ya heard
BK ya heard
Uh uh, the free-mix ya heard
I rely on Bed-stuy to shut it down when I die
Uh Uh, In The Words of my boy, B.I
I got you baby boy
The Roc is in the building
Let's do the damn thing Faith

[Jay-Z Verse 1]
I'm in a class all by myself
I run rap all by myself
Thinking about the past
When I try to forecast myself
Or when I get this cash
What I'm gon buy myself
More Money, More Problems
Now I'm feeling like big myself
Nigga's gon love you, Can't kid myself
Fuck it, I dig a ditch for those pricks myself
A Superstar but sometimes I forget myself
All alone in this world now I'm feeling like faith myself
Looking in the mirror, how could you take yourself?
How could you hate a dude getting cake like myself?
You should be like, I could be like that someday myself
I'm from the hood sort like yourself
It's all to the good now but bullet rounds are aimed towards myself
I dodged them, like neo
People try to assault my wealth
I'm here to say I put that on myself
HOV!

[Faith Evans Verse 2]
It's over now, I can't compete
I don't know how I'm still standing on my feet
So turned around and incomplete
I'm not that happy woman that I used to be

Oh, please tell me what did you mean
When you said that you were mine, you knew that was a lie
But in your heart you know that truth
And I'm trying to forget
All the things you put me through (Oh baby)

[Hook]
I never thought you'd turn you back
And walk away from love like that
While I was holding on to you
All you did was let me go

I never thought I would regret
The way I felt when we first met
And now I'm standing here
Alone in this world, alone

[Faith Evans Verse 3]
It's over now, we can't go on
In my eyes I thought that you could do no wrong
It's no surprise we both belong
Because of you my heart's singing us that song

Oh, please tell me what did you mean
When you said that you were mine, you knew that was a lie
But in your heart you know that truth
And I'm trying to forget
All the things you put me through (Oh baby)

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I can't believe our love is over now
Where did love go
And why did I believe that we would be together forever
Now it's all a memory

[Hook x2]
