[Intro]
Yeah, I've been waitin' for you
So patiently
And now you're here
You're my answer
Thank you
Yeah
I think you're my answer
Uh, here I go

[Chorus]
You're the answer
All this time, I've tried to find you
I've been yearning (I've been yearning inside)
You're the answer to the question that's been burning (I've been burning inside)
When they ask me who I love
You're the answer (You're my answer)
You're my answer

[Verse 1]
Patiently, I've waited for this day to finally come
Knowing someday somehow I would find that special one
Someone perfect, someone true
Someone that, I knew, was you
(I knew it was you)

[Pre-Chorus]
Who can hold me tight, keep me warm, through the night?
Who can wipe my tears, when it's wrong, make it right?
Who can give me love, 'til I'm satisfied?
Who's the one I need in my life?

[Chorus]
You're the answer
All this time, I've tried to find you
I've been yearning (I've been yearning inside)
You're the answer to the question that's been burning (I've been burning inside)
When they ask me who I love
You're the answer (You're my answer, baby)
You're my answer

[Verse 2]
I can hardly speak because I'm underneath your spell
Saving every moment that I have you to myself
Putting my love to the test
Because baby, this is destiny (Yeah, this is destiny)
Talk to 'em

[Pre-Chorus]
Who can hold me tight, keep me warm, through the night?
Who can wipe my tears, when it's wrong, make it right?
Who can give me love, 'til I'm satisfied?
Who's the one I need in my life?

[Chorus]
You're the answer
All this time, I've tried to find you
I've been yearning (I've been yearning inside)
You're the answer to the question that's been burning (I've been burning inside)
When they ask me who I love
You're the answer (You're my answer)
You're my answer
You're the answer
All this time, I've tried to find you
I've been yearning (I've been yearning for you)
You're the answer to the question that's been burning (I've been burning inside)
When they ask me who I love
You're the answer (You're my answer)
You're my answer

[Bridge]
Who can hold me tight, keep me warm, through the night?
Who can wipe my tears, when it's wrong, make it right?
Who can give me love, 'til I'm satisfied?
Who's the one I need in my life?

[Chorus]
You're the answer (You're the answer)
All this time, I've tried to find you
I've been yearning (I've been yearning inside)
You're the answer to the question that's been burning (I've been burning inside)
When they ask me who I love
You're the answer (You're my answer)
You're my answer
You're the answer (You're my answer)
You're my answer (You're my answer)
Yeah, you're my answer
