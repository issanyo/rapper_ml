[Puff Daddy-Intro] 4x
Ain't no remix like a Bad Boy remix
Cuz a Bad Boy remix don't stop

[Puff Daddy -During Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
We got little Jerome in the house tonight
He's about to do a remix that you've never heard before
He brought his man with him
Noreaga, you know, Thugged Out
Yeah, yeah, what, what, c'mon
Little Jerome

[Jerome] (Puff Daddy)
When I first saw you I wanted to become a man (What, what)
Each and everyday I sit and dream of holding your hand (Yeah)
Told all my boys how I felt for you
When they laid their eyes on you, they laughed
Cuz they don't know (The remix, c'mon)

1-	They don't know how I feel for you
	You girl, oh, why do they keep hating on me?
	Baby, they say that you are just too old
	Say you're just too old for me

[Jerome] (Puff Daddy)
So I stepped to you to see if I had a chance (Rock on)
They now realize that in your eyes there was a sweet man (That's right)
We finally walk together hand-in-hand
When they laid their eyes on us, they laughed (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cuz they don't know

Repeat 1

[Jerome]
Why do they say that you are not right for me?
You and me make perfect a harmony
Why do they insist that we are not together?
We belong, baby

[Noreaga] (Puff Daddy)
What, what, yo, yo
I be that boy slash Thugged Out, platinum, gold (Yeah)
Lil' Jerome, leave her alone, she too old (I like this right here)
But you still wanna mess wit' her, you outta control
And I'm the older one, oo I'll put you on again
Older girls break your heart, they take your fame
But when you want it back, the ?dario? is never the same
I'm feelin' good today, was in the hood today (Bad Boy, no doubt)
You need to stop seeing her, like Crimson Bay
(C'mon and we won't stop, yeah)
Bitches be hard to find like a needle in hay (C'mon)
Hard to pop, and call me, yo, and said to the spot (That's right)
Said you were singing at her window, wildin' and stuff (That's right)
Probably the CLK, that dude Jerome in the whip
I made a promise to my man, he ain't need that tea
He look back at me like he was mad at me (Mad?)
He said that he my little man and was glad to be (Glad)
He got his life ahead of him, small fish in the sea, what (Yeah)

Repeat 1 to fade

[Noreaga] (Puff Daddy)
What, Thugged Out, what, what, what
Bad Boy, Thugged Out, what, what, what (Bad Boy, Thugged Out)
Bad Boy, Thugged Out, what, what, what (This is the remix)
(Ain't no remix like a Bad Boy remix)
Aiyyo, my man like Lil' Jerome, Lil' Jerome (Bad Boy remix)
Aiyyo, my man like Lil' Jerome, Lil' Jerome (Til the year 2000)
Aiyyo, my man like Lil' Jerome, Lil' Jerome (He's only 11 years old)
Aiyyo, my man like Lil' Jerome, Lil' Jerome
(Yeah, I like your style, shorty, yeah, yeah, yeah, what, what, yeah)
Bad Boy, Thugged Out, what, what, what
