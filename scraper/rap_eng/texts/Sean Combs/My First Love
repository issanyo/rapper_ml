[Intro]
Why does it hurt so bad?
Why does it feel so sad?

[Verse 1]
To fall in love was something that my heart was dreaming of
And then there came the day when I found you
Then heaven came to earth and you were my angel
I fell in love with you
No one but you
And suddenly I saw the change that came into your eyes
I feel you were afraid to tell me why
I thought this thing called love would be forever
I thought our love was true
And now the pain of losing you

[Chorus]
If you never know just what you mean
You are my first love
If you never know
You're everything
You are my first love

[Verse 2]
Tell me how a thing that brings such joy can bring such pain
And how could something so wrong seem so right
We never had the chance to make it get better
We never said goodbye, no
I never wanna feel the pain of losing love again
'cause love just has a way of breaking down
Next time I'm gonna pray that things will be better
The second time around
So here's to love that's lost and found, oh oh

[Bridge]
I won't cry, no, I won't break down
Even though inside it hurts so bad
Next time I will make love last (yes I will)
Though you will always have a place in my heart

[Chorus]
If you never know just what you mean
You are my first love
If you never know
You're everything
You are my first love
If you never know just what you mean
You are my first love
If you never know
You're everything
You are my first love

[Bridge]
I won't cry, no, I won't break down
(I'm not gonna break down)
Even though inside it hurts so bad
Next time I will make love last
Though you will always have a place in my heart

[Refrain]
My first love, no one could ever take your place, no, no
My first love, no one could ever take your place, no, no

[Chorus]
If you never know just what you mean
You are my first love
If you never know
You're everything
You are my first love
If you never know just what you mean
You are my first love
If you never know
You're everything
You are my first love
