I wanna dedicate this song
To all the women, all over the world
That have to still deal with this issue
You know I've been there too
I had to deal with it with you
But come on now ladies, how many times he got to say her name?
Listen...

You came home late last night
You smelled just like the scent of her
Not only that but you had lipstick all over your shirt
I'm thinking to myself
This man has no respect for me
I knew it all along cuz you were talking in your sleep

It's a wrap
Why you gonna do me like that
I thought the love was good
But I misunderstood, baby
It's a wrap
And I am not surprised
How you could sit right here
And look me in my eyes and tell a lie

I heard you call her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do
Cuz I'm thru with you
I heard you call her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do
Cuz I'm thru with you
I heard you call her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do
Cuz I'm thru with you
I heard you...

What you were sayin in your sleep
It violated me
No doubt about it
But theres nothing left for you and me
Because your busted
And I might as well go on
Boy it's gonna take a long time
To make this a happy home
You know..

It's a wrap
Why you gonna do me like that
I thought the love was good
But I misunderstood, baby
It's a wrap
And I am not surprised
How you could sit right here
And look me in my eyes and tell a lie

I heard you call her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do
Cuz I'm thru with you
I heard you call her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do
Cuz I'm thru with you
I heard you call her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do
Cuz I'm thru with you
I heard you...

All you had to say is
I dont wanna be with you but
Don't you tell the truth now
I already have the proof and
It'll never be the same you
Know its a kinda shame b/c
Now I am disgusted
You are so busted

It's a wrap
Why you gonna do me like that
I thought the love was good
But I misunderstood, baby
It's a wrap
And I am not surprised
How you could sit right here
And look me in my eyes and tell a lie

I heard you call her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do
Cuz I'm thru with you
I heard you call her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do
Cuz I'm thru with you
I heard you call her name
In your sleep last night
What are we gonna do
Cuz I'm thru with you
I heard you...
