(Verse 1: Brian)
There's no other love
There's nobody else I'm thinking of
Only you baby you're special
How could I ever forget you
And let the moment slip away
We've been here for a while ha!
And I just wanna take you away

(Pre-Chorus: Willie)
You got me doing things I never do
I can't stop feenin' and dreamin' about you oh
And about your love it feels so real to me
You know what to say
And you know just what to do (come get me)

(Chorus: Willie)
What you got for me (oooh)
I wanna see (you know what I wanna see)
I've been waitin' way too long
(Got me losin' my cool)
Don't know what I'm gon' do (hey listen)
You got me going
You got me going

(Verse 2: Brian)
I can't wait no longer
My anxiety is building up
Moments turn into hours
And hours to days in my mind
Can someone tell me the time
I don't wanna wait in vain
And I don't wanna deal with the pain

(Pre-chorus: Robert)
You got me doin' things I never do
I can't stop feenin' and dreamin' about you oh whoa
And about your love it feels so real to me
You know what to say
And you know just what to do... (come get me)

(Chorus:Robert)
What you got for me (ooh)
I wanna see
I've been waitin' way too long (I've been waitin' way)
(Got me losin' my cool)
Don't know what I'm gon' do (yeah...)
You got me going (said you got me going)
You got me going (said you got me going)

(Chorus)

(Bridge: All & Big Mike w/ adlibs)
So beautiful (so beautiful)
Won't you let go (won't you let go)
I wanna know
See I got to know if you're ready
(I gotta know if you're ready)
For a moment so special
(Baby I don't think you're ready)
And I want you closer
I don't wanna let you go (don't wanna let you go)
Just let me be (let me be)
Be all that you need (be all that you need)
You got that thing that I want and I'm ready
(Everything I wanted oh man)
Ready to give you my love (my love)
You already know it
Girl you got me going (baby you got me)

(Chorus: Big Mike)
What you got for me (yeah)
I wanna see (that's what I wanna see)
I've been waitin' way too long
(Got me losin' my cool)
Don't know what I'm gon' do (ooh yeah yeah...)
You got me going (you got me...)
You got me going (hey)

(Chorus)
(Outro: All)
Know what I want from you
So what you got baby
You know I wanna see
What you can do with me
Girl If you only knew
The things that we can do
I'm ready to recieve
Just what you got for me
