[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, before you get here
Put your panties in your pocketbook
That’s what I told her over the Motorola
Hennessy and Cola
I hold her at attention with my manners
And even though I don’t roll a camera
She still performs like the superstar she truly are
So, also, I think I love her already
Damn, I think I, already, ha-heh
She must be the one
I look in her eyes and see the sun even on rainy days
Ain't it crazy mane? Yeah, that’s what I said
She do doughnuts in my head, over and over and over
Til the cops pull her over
And then she say some real slick shit like
“I’m on my way by Weezy Baby”
Heh, and of course they let her go
(Let me take off my shades)

[Verse 1: Bilal & (Diddy)]
I know I got a lot of baggage
It's full of ladies and Mercedes
You say "I know that it’s heavy"
But I'll pay someone to grab it, for me, yeah
I know I got a lot of baggage
Full of Chanel’s and Tiffany’s and broken hearts girl
You need me baby
It's hard to break a habit, for me, yeah
And girl if you want (what do you want me to do?)
I pour a gallon of gasoline on my heart just to light your cigarette
Girl if you want (I’ll do anything for you)
I’ll do anything for you (I’ll even take off my shades)
I’ll even take off my shades
And stare right at the sun from the stage
(I’ll even try different things) I’ll even try different things
I’ll make love to you on marmalade
(Never made love on marmalade)
I’ll even change my name, name, what you say
(I’ll be what ever you say) I’ll be what ever you say
I’ll even take off my shades
I’ll make love to you on marmalade
(Are you sure that's what you want to do)
If that's what you want to do

[Hook x2: Bilal & James Fauntleroy]
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
When I’m perfect for you, girl watch how it's gon drive you crazy
(What you gonna do?) And love’s gon turn you up baby
(What you gonna do?) Girl watch how its gon drive you crazy

[Verse 2: James Fauntleroy & (Diddy)]
Got a lot of baggage
It's full of shades, different shades
And I’m sharp as a razor, that's why I have to brand it
You talkin' 'bout me? (You talking' 'bout me? Listen to me)
I know I got a lot of baggage
It's full of promises that why I keep a lock on it
I promise girl I’m trying to make it happen, for me, and you babe
Now girl if you wanna pour a gallon of gasoline on my heart
And light it if you get lonely
If you call me, girl if you call me
If you want me I’m ready when you are just tell me you want me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]
Black, gray, white
If I pull down these shades would I sound too bright
Get it, sound too right
Maybe I’m just feeling myself cause
Flashing lights come from everywhere
And you can feel that something's blowing in the air tonight
Now if you need that fire I’ll be that propane
If you need it wet I can make it pour rain
But maybe I won't, maybe you just have to take it
Go ahead pretend I’m a drug now let me see you shake it
I can read your mind, read your mind, Professor X
We can press rewind, press rewind, VHS
Speaking of the past, its so futuristic behind ya
Let me fill up that plate and dish it out, dish it out, China
I’mma bend yo body, bend yo body, Magneto
Let me have my way, I’mma have my way, Carlito
Now we can put in work, let me get my busy on for you
You ain't never heard me talk like this, just got my Drizzy on for you

[Hook]
