Take my hand. Lead me to another place. I never been
I wanna be, be relieved. Set me free
I'm not talking about letting me go
But I'm just talking bout pulling me close
So were I bodies are becoming as one
Turn off the lights because we just begun, begun oh ooh...

Feel like makin' love all through the night (Feel like makin love)
All through the night, come hold me tight. (I feel like makin' love)
Feel like makin' love all through the night
All through the night, come hold me tight
(I feel like.. Makin' sweet, sweet love...)
Feel like makin' love all through the night, all through the night
Come hold me tight. Feel like makin' love all through the night
All through the night come hold me tight...

Hear I am. I'm all yours for tonight. But every night
It could be you and I for a lifetime
Could have stayed all to myself. Play the game like everybody else
But boy I want you and that's no lie. Because you keep me so satisfied...

Feel like makin' love all through the night (Feel like makin love)
All through the night, come hold me tight. (I feel like makin' love)

Feel like makin' love all through the night, all through the night
Come hold me tight. Feel like makin' love all through the night
All through the night come hold me tight...
