You don't know what you do to me

I love it when you're on top of it, so spread it
(Won't you just give it to me, girl we can do this)

Girl you know I wanna give it to you

Let me show you what real love should be
Girl you don't know, (come on) baby

Luda, yeah what you heard is true
I make you do things, you ain't even know you can do (don't hurt 'em now)
Got 'em weak in the knees cause my back is strong
And you wonder why your girls wanna tag along (uh huh)
Cause them birds is jealous, my words embellished
Plus they heard that I kiss every curve and crevice (yeah, let's go)
I'm too hot to handle, I rock your mantle
When I play 112 and light 16 candles (come on)
Deep sea fishin in your favorite position (can you handle that, yeah)
Everytime you moan I pay close attention (uh huh)
Flip 'em like a pancake (uh), show me somethin (that's right)
Or we can break in your vibratin tongue ring (come on)
Let's mountain climb 'til we reach the peak (touch, yeah)
The technique will make you sweat, but don't sweat the technique (that's right)

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[P. Diddy - talking behind Chorus]
Let's go, c'mon
Yeah, c'mon

[Verse 4 - 112] - w/ variations
Girl just keep it hot and wet (are you ready)
Girl I'm gonna make a sweat
Keep it real close to me
Let it drip all over me (I love the way you give it to me, baby)
You know just what I like (ohh)
Touch it, love it, freak it all night
I'm gettin it off me (you touch me like)
But baby you gotta keep it
