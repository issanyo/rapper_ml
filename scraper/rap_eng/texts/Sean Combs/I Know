[Chorus: Tony Thompson & Faith Evans]
Baby, I know
You don’t have to say a thing
And I know
All the pain that I bring
And I know
That you still care for me
Yes, I know

[Verse 1: Tony Thompson & (Faith Evans)]
If I had you next to me
Then maybe you can tell me (Tell me why)
All I do is sit around with thoughts of you
Lingering on my mind (Baby, you’re lingering)
Since you’ve been gone from my life (My life)
Lady, I need a change (A change, oh yeah)
Just one night is all I need
To make up for all of the pain
‘Cause baby I know

[Chorus: Tony Thompson & (Faith Evans)]
Baby, I know
You don’t have to say a thing
And I know
All the pain that I bring
And I know
That you still care for me
Yes, I know

[Verse 2: Tony Thompson & (Faith Evans)]
Lady, my heart won’t lie to you
I’ve made mistakes in the past
But that was back in the days we were young (Back in the day)
So let’s build a love that will last
I’ve been waiting to lay you down (Lay you down)
Cover your body with me (Oh, baby)
I understand you have some fears
But think of how things used to be
‘Cause baby I know

[Chorus: Tony Thompson & Faith Evans]
Baby, I know
You don’t have to say a thing
And I know
All the pain that I bring
And I know
That you still care for me
Yes, I know

[Bridge: Tony Thompson & (Faith Evans)]
I know I did you wrong
But I need you desperately (So much, I want ya)
Gave you the reason to want me back
So won’t you give it to me

[Chorus: Tony Thompson & Faith Evans]
Baby, I know
You don’t have to say a thing
And I know
All the pain that I bring
And I know
That you still care for me
Yes, I know

Baby, I know, know...

Baby, I know
You don’t have to say a thing
And I know
All the pain that I bring
And I know
That you still care for me
Yes, I know

Ooh yeah, I know
Baby, I know
I know
Yeah
