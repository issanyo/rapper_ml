[Intro]
Drum Majors, Gorilla Tek, y'all

[P. Diddy + (8Ball)]
Bad Boy, baby
Ball and G
(Yeah)
You ready?
(Some of that ghetto love shit)
Come on, let's go

[Verse 1: Eightball]
Smash with my niggas, you know how we do
Flippin' through the hood, that's when I bumped into you
At the car wash jumpin' out your E-Class
Petite frame with your little round fat ass
10 1/2 for your eyes and your pretty toes
I wanna know you but I heard you got a nigga though
Anyway, I'ma spit it like I know that you with it
My windows are tinted so he won't know that you in it
We can cruise the city and get the car weed scented
Drink a Hen, open up and let your boy squeeze in it
A G for real I never played those games
Wanna get in your brain, put some ice in your chain
You can stay with your mayne, act a fool and complain
Come and get with your boy, we just hang and bang
That's the business but you don't want a nigga like me
You want a weak ass nigga just pretendin' to be

[Chorus: 112]
I wish I would've said somethin'
That would've made you stopped walkin'
How can I let you know, girl
I'm trying to get at you, baby
(Can I talk to you?)
And instead of trying to step on you
I let another nigga up on you
How can I let you know, girl
I'm trying to get at you, baby
(Baby, I'm trying to get to you)

[Verse 2: MJG]
Baby, you need a hard leg, a straight nigga with no sugar
One that won't play no games and give it to you
In the buck, doggystyle, the whole mile
Mix it up, with the new and the old style
Ain't you tired of your man hangin' up at your job
Followin' you 'round, talkin' 'bout you breakin' his heart?
You too pretty, to have a nigga prettier than you
You need a cut-throat nigga, baby, tell you the truth
I'm MJG, and I ain't tryin' to stay in your face
Or crowd your space or try to get a key to your place
I got my own spot, shit, but we gon' hit the hotel-ly
I can't take you to my spot until I know that you're ready
See, I ain't the one to fall in love just in a week
Take out all my money then go invest in a freak
I see something I like, baby, can I just get a number?
Don't worry 'bout the stress and the pressure he got you under

[Chorus: 112]
I wish I would've said somethin'
That would've made you stopped walkin'
(Made you stop walkin', girl)
How can I let you know, girl
I'm trying to get at you, baby
(Girl, I'm trying to get to you)
And instead of trying to step on you
I let another nigga up on you
How can I let you know, girl
I'm trying to get at you, baby
(Baby, I'm trying to get to you)

[Verse 3: 8Ball]
Look, if your boy calls, tell him that you're rollin' with your girls
Tell him y'all shoppin', you gon' meet him at the crib
Really I'ma have you somewhere diggin' in your ribs
Pullin' off the rubber and shootin' it on your lips
Dream about the day when I can hold your hips
Wanna spoil you and tell niggas you my bitch
See, you got a nigga, I don't wanna see y'all split
The real nigga in me make a nigga do that shit

[Verse 4: MJG]
You're listenin' to your friends again, oh no
Why you wanna take advice from them? They solo
I'm the one that put the spark in your life, all night
And all day, so motherfuck what they all say
Tell 'em MJ said it and MJ done it
Shot straight into your life like Haley's Comet
Eliminated them other cats who wanna run it
Keep the bullshit, we'll take you away from it

[Chorus: 112]
I wish I would've said somethin'
That would've made you stopped walkin'
(Made you stop walkin', girl)
How can I let you know, girl
I'm trying to get at you, baby
(I'm trying to get to you)
And instead of trying to step on you
I let another nigga up on you
How can I let you know, girl
I'm trying to get at you, baby
(How can I let you know? Oh...)

[Outro: Slim + P. Diddy]
Can I talk to you? I really wanna meet you, girl
I really wanna know your name, oh
Sing it again, one more time
Can I talk to you? I really wanna meet you, girl
I really wanna know your name, oh
112
Ball and G, 112, Bad Boy
Drum Majors, I see you
I like this right here
Let's go
