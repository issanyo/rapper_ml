[Verse 1]
5 foot 9
She's got legs for days (For days)
Green eyes that cut like a knife
And her own little sexy sway
No, she don't waste no time
Moving to the floor (To the floor)
And when she starts to move
She have you calling your mama saying "You wanna go home"

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, tell me
Why can't I have you?
Why you running girl?
I just wanted to love you

[Chorus]
I love you, baby
I love you
I love you, baby
I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you, baby
I want you
I want you, baby
I want you
But I guess love don't love me, no

[Verse 2]
It's OK to be scared
'Cause this girl is super bad (Yeah, yeah)
She will probably be the best thing that you never had
(The best thing that you never had)
Don't waste no time (Waste your time)
Trying to make her your own (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause what she says goes
And like Boyz II Men said, this is the end of the road

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, tell me (Tell me)
Why can't I have you? (Why can't I have you?)
Why you running, girl? (Why you running, girl?)
I just wanted to love you

[Chorus]
I love you, baby
I love you
I love you, baby
I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
(Don't have the time for me, yeah)
I want you, baby
I want you
I want you, baby
I want you
But I guess love don't love me, no

[Bridge]
Baby, you said you loved me (You said you loved me)
But you led me on
Left me feeling strong (Feeling so strong about...)
About you
But I can't take no more, so I'm gonna leave you alone
Girl, I'm gone; girl, I'm gone, OH!

What's it gonna take to get you to love me, baby?
'Cause I can't take it anymore (Take it no more!)
You're gonna be mine for sure, ya know (Hey, hey, yeah)
What's it gonna take to get you to love me, baby?
(Baby, what's it gonna take?)
'Cause I can't take it anymore
(Can't take it no more!)
You're gonna be mine for sure, ya know

[Chorus]
I love you, baby
I love you (Love you)
I love you, baby
I love you (Said I love you)
But I guess you don't have time for me
(Guess you ain't interested in me, yeah)
I want you, baby
I want you (Said I want you)
I want you, baby
I want you (Come on)
But I guess love don't love me, no
(Baby, what's so bad about me? Yes!)

I love you, baby
I love you
I love you, baby
I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you, baby
I want you
I want you, baby
I want you
But I guess love don't love me, no

I love you, baby
I love you
I love you, baby
I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
(Guess you just don't want me, baby)
I want you, baby
I want you
I want you, baby
I want you
But I guess love don't love me, no
(Guess you don't want me, baby)

I love you, baby (Love you)
I love you (Love you)
I love you, baby
I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you, baby
I want you
(You know what?! Screw you!)
But I guess love don't love me
