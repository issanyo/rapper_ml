[Verse 1 - Aubrey]
I'm so hot when I walk I leave smoke in my tracks
Don't leave your man with me cause he won't come back
I'm dangerous
(It's when the lights go out)

[Aundrea]
I'm a girl that's not afraid of the dark
When the lights go out I get what I want
So easy
(When the lights go out)

[Pre-Chorus - Dawn]
I don't know what you want to do
But I want to get you up in my room
I like (your swagger)
Gotta (have it)
Gotta have it
So won't you come along
Come out (of the light)
Into the dark (dark)

[Chorus - Danity Kane]
Turn off my lights
And see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights
And see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights
And see if you wanna get into my dark side
You ain't never, ever
Had a nothing better
When the lights go out..

[Verse 2 - Dawn]
I dig in my bag and see what I pull out
I got a lot of tricks, so let me start out
?????
When the lights go out

[Shannon]
I'mma change your good boy status
Break all your good habits
Momma's going to make you an addict
When the lights go out

[D. Woods]
I'm gonna make you a new man
Have you talking to all your friends
Baby you ain't seen a thing
When the lights go out

[Aubrey]
I'm the type of girl that always get what I want
So be sure before you come up in the dark
Cause you about to see
When the lights go out

[Pre-Chorus - D. Woods]
I don't know what you want to do
But I want to get you up in my room
I like (your swagger)
Gotta (have it)
Gotta have it
So won't you come along
You ain't gotta be afraid of the dark

[Chorus - Danity Kane]
Turn off my lights
And see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights
And see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights
And see if you wanna get into my dark side
You ain't never, ever
Had a nothing better
When the lights go out..

[Bridge - Danity Kane]
You ain't never ever, never ever
Seen a girl like me
D-A-N-I-T-Y K-A-N-E
Ah!

You ain't ever had nothing boy
You ain't never had nothing boy
So why don't you come and turn the lights out?


[Pre-Chorus - Dawn]
I don't know what you want to do
But I want to get you up in my room
I like (your swagger)
Gotta (have it)
Gotta have it
[Aundrea]
So won't you come along
You ain't gotta be afraid of the dark

[Chorus - Danity Kane]
Turn off my lights
And see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights
And see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights
And see if you wanna get into my dark side
You ain't never, ever
Had a nothing better
When the lights go out..

Turn off my lights
And see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights
And see if you wanna get into my dark side
Turn off my lights
And see if you wanna get into my dark side
You ain't never, ever
Had a nothing better
When the lights go out..
