[Intro]
Ooh
You remind me, yeah
You remind me of such sweet memories

[Chorus]
I seen you before, baby
It's a deja vu, honey
Don't you know that you remind me?
I seen you before, baby
It's a deja vu, honey
Don't you know that you remind me?

[Verse 1]
You, you remind me of a love that I once knew
Is it a dream or is it deja vu?
I just had to let you know so I had to sing it
Cause for you, boy, I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
The way you walk and
The way you talk and
The way you move and
You remind me, yes you do
Of the way you dress and
The way you dance and
You really like to groove it
You remind me
You remind me, yeah

[Chorus]
I seen you before, baby
It's a deja vu, honey
Don't you know that you remind me?
I seen you before, baby
It's a deja vu, honey
Don't you know that you remind me?

[Verse 2]
You, you remind me of a memory
And this is something you should know
Sweet baby darling, come on just stop playing with my mind
Cause for you, boy, I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
The way you walk and
The way you talk and
The way you move and
You remind me, yes you do
Of the way you dress and
The way you dance and
You really like to groove it
You remind me
You remind me, yeah

[Chorus]
I seen you before, baby
It's a deja vu, honey
Don't you know that you remind me?
I seen you before, baby
It's a deja vu, honey
Don't you know that you remind me?
