[Intro]
Mmmm, my darling, my darling
Oooh, darling, o-o-o-oh

[Verse 1]
Now I know that you've been staying at home, baby
Yeah, all alone
And I've been working day and night, baby
(just working day and night)
I know that you've been tired of hearing the same old song
(Baby, I don't really blame ya)
For feeling all that you feel
It seems we've got a problem
I swear I'll compromise
I've been working really hard just to make it right
So I never gonna leave you again
I'll never leave you again

[Chorus]
Ooooh
It's been a long long time since I've seen your smile
Since I felt your touch
Oooh, I miss you so much
I've been gone for so long
And I know I were wrong
So I never going to leave you again
I'll never going to leave you again

[Verse 2]
And sometimes I get caught up in things that I do
And boy, I never pay attention at time
(It passes so fast)
Although I call you on the phone
Honey I get a thing
Only one thing about reality
I feel like a fool, and I do
You could be spending time with somebody else
But instead you're still at home
All alone night and day
So I'm never going to leave you again
I'll never leave you again

[Bridge]
Ooo-hooo
Sha-bi-du-day, wee-woo-bi-du-du-woop-du-du-doo
Wa-di-du-du-du-dub-di-du-du oh oh
Zip-zipn-zip-du-du-zipn-zipn-dip-yeah yeah
Wab-web-wab-web-wa-waa-waaaa

[Verse 3]
I'll promise that I'll never leave ya
Hoping and now I'm trying
And if you ever have a problem call my name and I'll be there
All I want is you to let me back into your arms
And I'm staying by your side
Give me a chance

[Chorus]
It seems we've got a problem
I sweart I'll compromize
I've been working day and night just to make it right, baby
Never going to  leave you again
I'll never leave you again., wo auuh
Well, I never going to leave you again
I'll never leave you again, oooh ooh, yeah, eeih yah
I'm going to be right by your side, oh baby, yeah
I ain't going nowhere, hey yeah
