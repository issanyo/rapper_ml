[Hook]
Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child

[Verse: Keyshia Cole]
If I told you once, I told you twice
You can see it in my eyes
I'm all cried out with nothing to say
You're everything I want it to be
If you could only see, your heart belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours I'll be
Baby won't you come and take this pain away

[Hook]
Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child

[Bridge: Keyshia Cole]
I need you and you need me
This is so plain to see
And I would never let you go
And I will always love you so I will
If you could only see, your heart belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours I'll be
Baby won't you come and take this pain away

[Hook]
Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child

[Break]
Tell me what words to say to make you comeback
Don't break me like that
And if it matters, I'd rather stay home
With you I'm never alone
Don't wanna wait 'til you're gone
Whatever you do, just don't leave me

[Hook]
Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child

[Bridge: Keyshia Cole]
I need you and you need me
This is so plain to see
And I would never let you go
And I will always love you so I will
If you could only see, your heart belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours I'll be
Baby won't you come and take my pain away

[Hook]
Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child

[Outro: Keyshia Cole]
Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number
And call me up baby, I'm waiting on you
Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number
Just call me up baby, I'm waiting on you
