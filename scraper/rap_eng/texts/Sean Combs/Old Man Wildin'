[Intro:]
What I grow so gross it make you sick
My last couple wins came by forfeit
You not inside the same league as us
I had to say a pray for the evil eye

[Verse 1: French Montana]
One life to live two bitches rolling
Took the dirty money had to barcode it
[?] fuck the talent when you God gifted
Coupe lows how we stay lifted
Shorty want time tryna buy the right watch
Danny Garcia by the rope white fox
And yeah homie we don't sleep
Love still the same even though we don't speak
Montana Coke boy behind the scene like Corleone
Mami love me and canaries like Romeo
Prince of NY word to Jesus
Ciroc cut the check fuck the Grey Goose
?[] Christopher Walker bumping Christopher king of New York
Trust your dog on the stand with a murder
He fresh out the can keep his hand off the burner
Watch the turn up
Miss Gladys been a pusher you can ask Malice
Mobb Deep nigga wreak some havoc
Yeah homie we don't sleep
Brown diamonds for them suckas tryna shit on me
Hope you bleed like us
Running through them towns have 3 licenses
Took a pill stood 3 nights up
You ain't like us

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
Tri-polar they gon say that money made me wild
High roller throw a million dollars in the crowd
G'd up flying through the clouds
Only God get higher than I and a pilot couldn't get flyer than I
Desire got fire in his eyes and his stomach
Just wait until you get what you got coming
What the greedy think
I turn City bank to Diddy bank
And I don't care about your piggy bank
You a silly boy Im a billi boy
I ain't gotta touch you get one of my young Philly boys
Harlem Renaissance
Upper Echelon
Check right of the nigga they coming check up on
Nigga please we spend Gs in the restaurant
7 on the entree 3 on the dessert ask for the job cause you know you need to wizzurk
You know me you know we don't sleep like I was there at the Carter for the Nino speech
Rothstein and casino reach with no ginger
Everybody copying my style is infringement
You know me you know we don't sleep like I was there at the Carter for the Nino speech
Rothstein and casino reach with no ginger
Everybody copying my style is infringement

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yeah, kill shit and get the same time Max B got
Cause dude with these colorful chains rap peacocks
As far as the game I was in it I represent it
Way back when heroin became a epidemic
And the feds are dead at least a certain percentage
Only hurting your image
Your whole life's a gimmick
And we can't click cause you all petty
I done told y'all i'm heavy like New York Freddy
It's an honor to meet him a pleasure to speak with him
Trunk full of champagne bottles with leak in em
Street value say it's a million in each of em
Contracts in the hood ain't no breach in em
Yeah, the profit is tremendous
But the gossip is still endless
No way you can offend us
[?] parties with Madonna in attendance
Wow
