[Intro: Red Cafe & Diddy]
More money
Yeah, ayo ain't nobody getting
As much money as us, baby
Shake down, more money
Bad Boy, ayo Cafe

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Light skin broad, fucked her in the car
And gave her my work, told her put it in her bra
Next week this time she killing them all
Tell your ex nigga, I'ma show him how to ball

I'm a dope boy, Kush, flowery
Ain't been a better bad boy since Mike Lowry
Fresh like I dry cleaned the whole wardrobe
My team doing numbers, check the bar codes

I don't chase money, don't ever chase bitches
I just chase liquor but have them all licking
Back in my city, I'm a gorilla
I got that uncut, I'm a dope dealer

[Hook: Red Cafe & Diddy]
I'm dope boy, balling
I swear I should be playing at the garden
I'm looking like Doughboy in my Jordan's
Every night flipping numbers till the morning

Now let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Now let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Take that, let me get this

[Verse 2: Diddy]
Yeah, last time you seen me I was in that blue thing
With a supermodel now, I'm in that new thing
With a newer model and I made her pump the gas
Took her up to Harlem then I pumped that ass

I remember I was counting five hundred milly
Around the same time Weezy recorded a milly
One for the money, two for the money
Love a real bitch, that's all about her money

Sorry ass niggas out here, looking funny
So I'm in my own world, spaced out, Kid Cudi
Hold the fuck up, RIP hoodie
We're still stunting on 'em, got the hood going dummy

[Hook: Red Cafe & Diddy]
I'm dope boy, balling
I swear I should be playing at the garden
I'm looking like Doughboy in my Jordan's
Every night flipping numbers till the morning

Now let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Now let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
I ain't gotta turn swag on, fuck is your problem
I be automatic now when the hoes coming down
Fuck y'all lames, ain't not I'm throwing out all lasers
And our homie always do it for the city
And I love my city, all we do is stack paper
Sex, drugs, getting money that's what's up
Party all night long, and my team riding with me roll one light up

I'm dope boy, balling
I swear I should be playing at the garden
I'm looking like Doughboy in my Jordan's
Every night flipping numbers till the morning

Now let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Now let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

[Outro: Red Cafe]
I did that, I said I did that
I did that, what else?
