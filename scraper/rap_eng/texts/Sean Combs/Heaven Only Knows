[Verse 1]
Who knows what tomorrow brings
And heaven only knows what's on the other side of the rainbow
All I know is what the seasons bring
And even with the seasons come uncertainty

[Pre-Chorus]
Who knows? (Who knows?)
Do you know? (Do you know?)
I don't know (I don't know)

[Chorus]
Heaven only knows what the future holds
Heaven only knows what's over the rainbow
Just imagine all the possibilities
Heaven only knows what the future holds

[Verse 2]
God gave me a conscious heart
And my responsibility is to teach my people
Trying to make them understand
Your will, your perfect plan

[Pre-Chorus]
Who knows? (Who knows?)
Do you know? (Do you know?)
I don't know (I don't know)

[Chorus]
Heaven only knows what the future holds
(God only knows)
Heaven only knows what's over the rainbow
Just imagine all the possibilities
(If we come together, we can change it)
Heaven only knows what the future holds
(Take it one day at a time)
Heaven only knows what the future holds
(Live your life and you'll be fine)
Heaven only knows what's over the rainbow
Just imagine all the possibilities
Heaven only knows what the future holds
(Oh, Heaven only knows)

[Bridge]
We can't live for tomorrow
So make the best out of today
We gotta keep the faith
If we just keep that faith through the night
We'll be alright

[Chorus]
Heaven only knows what the future holds
Heaven only knows what's over the rainbow
Just imagine all the possibilities
(Can you imagine all the possibilities?)
Heaven only knows what the future holds
Heaven only knows what the future holds
Heaven only knows what's over the rainbow
(Take it one day at a time)
Just imagine all the possibilities
(Live your life and you'll be fine)
Heaven only knows what the future holds
Heaven only knows what the future holds
Heaven only knows what's over the rainbow
Just imagine all the possibilities
Heaven only knows what the future holds
