[Verse 1]
I'm so lonely
Lonely for only you
See these stars they told me
We run, like bad news
And when I'm all alone, and there's no one here to do
I have my fun, and usually that makes for bad news
Just me

[Chorus]
Lust has no mercy, no no no
Lust has no mercy, no no no
I want what I want
I need what I need
So why can't I please you?
No no no, lust has no mercy
No

[Verse 2]
I'm so lonely
Lonely for only you
There's a note to how you own me
Pass me, only to be used
When I'm all alone, and no one here to do
I have my fun, and usually that makes for bad news
Trust me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Do you love me
No
Do you love me
No
Lose it all for me
No
Give it up to me

[Breakdown]
[?]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
