[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Clap your hands to the beat
Just clap your hands to the beat (Come on)

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
How can I love somebody else
If I can't love myself enough to know
When it's time
Time to let go
Sing

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy (I wanna be happy, yeah)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I asked for a sign from the sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me, but when
You think you're in love, you only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you, and you for me

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
All I really want
Is to be happy (I wanna be happy)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy (I wanna be happy, yeah)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Life is too short to be tryin' to play some games
Now take some time and think about
If it's really worth losing me
Why must it be this way?
Why do you have to play with my mind all the time?
Help me sing it

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
All I really want
Is to be happy (Help me sing it)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet (All I want is to be...)
All I really want
Is to be happy (...happy)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
(I don't wanna have to worry 'bout nothin' no more, no no)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet (I wanna be happy, yeah)
All I really want
Is to be happy (I wanna be happy, yeah yeah)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

(Remix)

[Rap: Keith Murray + (Puff Daddy ad-libs)]
Yo, my style is major flavor
And my 9 be on my hip like my skypager (That's right)
All I really wanna do is be happy
And take it to the streets and puff a little bombazee
And have mad properties like Ali Baba and the 40 thieves
'Cause nobody makes songs like these (unh-uh) â€” please
I come with complexity poetry at multiple degrees on phony MC's
(Yeah) And my Squad is Def, they don't hear nothin'
And my tank is on 'F', and that's not for frontin'
I spread love like the AIDS virus
Laughing at rappers and biters who try this
My purpose is to let all the bull(shit) surface
And seal and kill it with a deadly kiss
Even though Keith Murray's style is scrappy and nappy
All I wanna do is be happy (Be happy)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige + (Puff Daddy ad-libs)]
All I really want
Is to be happy (Yeah)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet (Rock on)
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want (Say what?)
Is to be happy (Rock on)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet (Remix)
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet (Come on)
(Bad Boy...'95...clap your hands to the beat)
