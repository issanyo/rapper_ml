[Chorus:]
I never really knew I had it this bad
But I do
And I should say that

I'll never ever leave you
Just as long
As you keep it going on

[Verse 1:]
You make me shiver
You make me weak
You make it so good sometimes
I just can't speak

Don't take this lightly
I'm in a daze
Infatuated, baby
Truly amazed

The way you hold me
And call my name
Erases all the lies
And all the games

So baby, squeeze me
Don't let me loose
Keep loving me the way
The way you do

[Chorus:]
I never really knew I had it this bad
But I do and I should say that
I'll never ever leave you just as long
As you keep it goin' on like that

I never really knew I had it this bad
But I do and I should say that
I'll never ever leave you just as long
As you keep it goin' on

[Verse 2:]
There's no denying
There is no doubt
There is no use in trying to do without

Your love is so strong, baby
Your eyes are deep
You turn me on, my darling
Fulfill my needs

I'm not gonna bitch now, baby
I won't complain
Your hooks are so far in me
I feel no shame

And everything has changed
Since you found out
You got me where you want me
Baby
I'm in your house

[Repeat Chorus x4:]

[Bridge:]
Keep it going on
Keep it going on
Keep it going on
Keep it going on

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

Never
Never leave you alone
'Cuz I got it so bad

[Repeat Chorus x2:]
