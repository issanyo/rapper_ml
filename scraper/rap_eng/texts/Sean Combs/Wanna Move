[Intro]
ATL, Georgia
To New York City
The Kings have Arrived
Let's Rock

Uh huh
Don't Stop
Let's Rock
Don't Stop
Let's Rock
Let's Rock
Don't Stop

[Scar]
Hey Forever I'm on the grind
My mind is already made up
Sippin the finest wine
To Jamaica
Everyday that I make up
I look up at Chirst and think
Therefore he lifts me up
So I don't see no haters

[Diddy]
Let me get an order
I got sumthin' for ya
You ever seen a black man
Walk on water?
Talk Shit to me
And I'mma try to ignore ya
Get Disrespectful
And I'mma have to come for ya
And I won't go get your lawyers
Cause my combo quick
They comin' like de la hoya
Watch Niggas in the streets
Cause they will come for ya

[Ciara]
[Hook]
Don't ya wanna move
Does this make you groove?
Is the feelin good to you
It matters
Get ya Hot
Our music our music
Come enjoy the fun
Don't ya wanna move
Just make ya wanna groove
Does this feelin' get to you
Let Us get you Hot
Our music our music
Come enjoy the ride

[Big Boi]
Need I remind yall
I started from the bottom
But I'm destined for the top
And I ain't stoppin'
Till I got em
Call me clumsy for the weight
I'm droppin' records
BUt they breakin'
Still standin'
Like the fuse on my cannon
Blowin' weight kid
Top shelf you gotta reach high to be the best
I'm like Hennessey and coke and XO
And nothin' less
I'm the nigga BIG I know you know the rest
Suppose I was a toad
And no I ain't gonna rest
I'mma bang on
And make this music that we sang on
Like skunk
Always got my stink on
Hang on
You wasn't bangin' before we came on
You know you lame holmes
Zero ziltch
Blow out ya candles
Do it ya don't son

[Ciara]
[Hook]
Don't ya wanna move
Does this make ya wanna groove
Is the feelin' good to you
It matters
Get ya hot
Our music our music
Come enjoy the fun
Don't ya wanna move
Just make ya wanna groove
Does this feelin' get to you
Let us get ya hot
Our music our music
Come enjoy the ride

[Big Boi]
Need I remind yall
I started from the bottom
But I'm destined for the top
And I ain't stoppin'
Till I got em
Call me clumsy for the weight
I'm droppin' records
BUt they breakin'
Still standin'
Like the fuse on my cannon
Blowin' weight kid

[Diddy]
Here we go back again
Makin' that beat go bump bump bump bump
So hard
Why do niggas act so hard
I don't give a damn about a broad
I ain't gotta floss in the fastlane
Ride right past lane
I'mma in the ATL
Flyin' down cascade
Still spendin' money
Ain't nothin' change man
Spend a couple mill
Just to make my change rang

[Big Boi]
Hang on
You wasn't bangin' before we came on
You know you lame holmes
Zero ziltch
Blow out ya candles
Do it ya don't son

[Ciara]
Don't ya wanna move
Does this make ya wanna groove
Is the feelin' good to you
It matters
Get ya hot
Our music our music
Come enjoy the fun
Don't ya wanna move
Just make ya wanna groove
Does this feelin' get to you
Let us get ya hot
Our music our music
Come enjoy the ride

[Diddy]
Hey yo Ciara
Take us home baby

[Ciara]
I feel high on the music
I feel
I might lose it
It's talkin' through the melody
I can hear it tellin' me
To move
I feel high on the music
I feel
I might losin'
It's talkin' through the melody
I can hear it tellin' me to move
ARE YOU READY TO PRESS PLAY?
ARE YOU READY TO PRESS PLAY?

[Diddy]
Nah they ain't ready
They don't believe me yet baby
Y'all don't believe me yet?
