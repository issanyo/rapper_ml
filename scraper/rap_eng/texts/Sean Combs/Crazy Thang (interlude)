Stop
Just
Come on now
Just

Sometimes I just
Get out ya
I just feel so confused
No don't do that
I just wanna know how you feel
Don't do it
I love you
Do you know what you've done
I've always needed you
But I really love her
You see, love is a crazy thing
At first it feels so good
[Laughter]
And you would think
It last forever
But then it also hurts so bad
You know somethin'
I hate ya guts
Leave me the freak alone
Then what you do
Do you give up?
Or do you believe?
I'll always love you
