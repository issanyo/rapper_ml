[Intro: P. Diddy]
Ayo, you ready?
Let's do it

[Verse 1: P. Diddy]
I'm the definition of "half man, half drugs"
Ask the clubs, Bad Boy, that's wussup
After bucks, crush crews after us
No games, we ain't laughing much
Nothing but big things, check the hit list
How we twist shit, what changed but the name?
We still here, you rockin' with the best
Don't worry if I write rhymes, I write checks (Ha!)
Who's the boss? Dudes is lost
Don't think cause I'm iced out, I'mma cool off
Who else but me? And if you don't feel me
That mean you can't touch me, it's ugly, trust me
Get it right, dawg, we ain't ever left
We just moved in silence and repped to the death
It's official, I survive what I been through
Y'all got trauma, the saga continues

[Hook]
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life

[Verse 2: Black Rob]
Hey yo straight from the Harlem streets
I don't play, I push it down with the Harlem Heat
All a sudden niggas got a problem wit me
They run around actin like the Black-o can't eat
And you know what? For some strange reason
I'm off of this medication, feeling deranged needing
For y'all to put the word out, we ain't leavin'
We trying to be rich before we all stop breathing
Therefore we kinda hustle lames
Stay laying down our muscle games
Still turn niggas dreams to flames, you got the wire
If not I ain't sayin no names; you'll soon expire
No pain, nothing, I feel remorse
Yes of course it's me and Diddy up first racing Porsches
With the big twin valve exhausts
On the cover of your Vibes, XXLs, and Sources, bitch

[Hook]
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life

[Verse 3: Mark Curry]
It ain't shit changed, since the Notorious (we miss you Big)
See everything still glorious
We still got warriors, still be the victorious
See it's a lot of them, but it's more of us
Still got cash to blow, raps to flow
Still them cats that know, pack yo' flow
That's fo' sho', bottles that pop, joints that rock
Played the background, hand on my jock, holdin' my Glock
Money to get, cars to flip
Bars to sit at and sip Cognac wit jewels that drip
Hoes to see, make sure they knowin' it's me
Drop that beat, can't believe that I MC
Bad boy 'til the casket drop, gotta love it
Place nothing above it, it's on like that
Don't believe, we ain't gone like that
We're always gonna be here
We there every motherfucking year!

[Hook]
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life

[Outro]
We ain't goin' nowhere, we ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now, cos it's Bad Boy for life
