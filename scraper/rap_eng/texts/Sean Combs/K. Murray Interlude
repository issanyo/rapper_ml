[Keith Murray]
Ayo, catch this wordage bubonic plague
In your head, back, chest, arms, and legs
When I'm coming through, grab your cranium for alternatum, son
I faze subterranium
My subliminals mix with criminal chemicals
Got more milky syllables...

[Puff Daddy]
Yo, Chuck, throw on some of that smooth shit, man...
