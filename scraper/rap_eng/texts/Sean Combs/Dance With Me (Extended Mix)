[Intro]
Come on
Faster
Now if you could just walk in
Dance
Haha

[Verse 1]
Too much is on your mind, gotta let it go
Can't worry all the time, just let it flow
You say you need a break, there’s nothing I can do
Sitting here listening to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, what's this you tell me?
Things ain't been going your way, just take it from me
It’s gonna be alright, so let's go out tonight
And we can leave all our cares behind

[Chorus]
Dance the night away (Dance)
Party 'til the sun comes up (Oh, yeah)
Go grab a friend, get on the floor
Come on and dance (Dance)
Dance (Dance)
Dance (Dance) with me
DJ, if you please

[Verse 2]
Nobody's on the wall, that's what I like
Come closer to me now and hold me tight
Tell me just how you're feeling right now
Are you really having a good time?

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, what's this you tell me?
Things ain't been going your way, just take it from me
It’s gonna be alright, so let’s go out tonight
And we can leave all our cares behind

[Chorus]
Dance the night away (All night)
Party 'til the sun comes up (Yeah)
Go grab a friend, get on the floor (Just dance)
Come on and dance (Dance)
Dance (Dance)
Dance (Dance) with me
DJ, if you please

[Refrain]
Just let yourself go (Go)
Dance on the floor (On the floor)
Nobody’s stopping you (Stopping you)
Do what you wanna do (Do what you wanna do)
Just let the music take control (Control)
You can feel it in your soul
Come on and move your body to the groove

[Interlude]
Up, huh, uh
Come on, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Bridge]
Up in the club (The club)
Out on the floor (The floor)
Move to the beat (Come on, move your body)
Dancing with me (Come on, move your body)
DJ, DJ, play my music
Dance the night away

[Refrain]
Just let yourself go ('Self go)
Dance on the floor (On the floor)
Nobody's stopping you (Stopping you)
Do what you wanna do (Do what you wanna do)
Just let the music take control
You can feel it in your soul (In your soul)
Come on and move your body to the groove

[Chorus]
Dance the night away (Away)
Party 'til the sun comes up (Yeah)
Go grab a friend, get on the floor (Go and grab a friend)
Come on and dance (Dance)

Dance with me
DJ, if you please
Dance the night away (All night)
Party ’til the sun comes up (Yeah)
Go grab a friend, get on the floor
Come on and dance (Just dance)
