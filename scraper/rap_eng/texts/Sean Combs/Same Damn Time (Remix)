[Intro: Diddy]
See sometimes in life these motherfuckers take your kindness for weakness
So sometimes in life you just got to blow their motherfucking faces off

[Hook: Future]
I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto, I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time

[Interlude: Diddy]
Ay yo, turn my mic up man
I don`t even know why motherfuckers is trying to touch this motherfucker
Niggas' pedegree ain't pure enough for this
Niggas you can't multitask nigga! Ya'll niggas can't multitask!
You know you can't do the remix without me
Don`t nobody talk shit like me bitch, check it out

[Verse 1: Diddy]
Boy your money and my money ain’t the same damn kind
I can live your life and my life at the same damn time
See my riding out money that’s yo’ “buy yo’ house” money
I got that “I can build a mall right by your house” money
(Hold up) Say you got that 550, you talking ’bout that Benz, nigga?
Say I got that 550, I’m talking ’bout them M’s, nigga
All black Phantom, white seats, I killed them bring them white sheets
Say ooo I think she like me ’cause I cop Maybachs like white tees
I’m in Time, People, Fortune, Forbes same damn time
XXL, GQ, Vibe, Source same damn time
Nigga you don’t live that shit that’s in yo’ lame ass rhymes
Y’all done woke a sleeping giant now the game back mine

[Hook: Future]
I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto, I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time

[Verse 2: Future]
I'm in Phipps with the set going crazy
Got some diamonds round my neck no fugazi
Bad bitches in the suite, tryna to bait me
Just a young hood nigga, streets raised me
Working with a unit, tryna stretch it to another one
Drinking on that activis, then it tasting like some bubble gum
Thumbing through the check, boarding on a jet
Talking on the iPhone, sipping out the styrofoam
That dirty got my mind gone, that money got my mind blown
VVS and white stones, VVS and white stones
I'm rolling like a rolling stone
Free Bandz on Al Capone
And my cash way long
I see a bunch of clones

[Hook: Future]
I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto, I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Luda is unstoppable, his money is astronomical
Sell as many records as a nigga like me that shit is just impossible
Rappers is delusional and now they talking more shit
Anything is liable to come out of the mouth of a desperate starving broke bitch
Choke, bitch, you used to be good but now you garbage
Any nigga that wanna step up to the plate and battle will get demolished
My flows is rubbing off like just like they finger nail polish
You rappers ain't got no swag you need to kill your fucking styilst
They biting like piranhas, they crying to they momma
These niggas besta call they troops back like Obama
That trash that ya spitted didn't phase me
Matter fact ya record label still pays me
See Luda never starting shit I'm always on my grind
But I'll respond three rappers at the same damn time

[Hook: Future]
I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto, I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time
