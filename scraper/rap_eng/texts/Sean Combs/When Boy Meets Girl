Hook by 112:
Baby I can't figure it out
Your kiss is just like honey
(Repeat throughout song)

Chorus:
You can't deny what you feel for me
Baby, baby, baby, baby
See love comes once so let's take it babe
Baby, baby

Verse One:
Tell me baby
If I need you you're here with me
Show me baby
That the love we share is real
So...

Repeat Chorus

Verse Two:
I need you baby
Let me show you the way to my heart
Trust me baby
And so I won't let you go away

Bridge:
You said that love was too confusing
But see I'm so relaxed I will let it lead the way
Uncontrollably no one can refuse it
See I've got to have that loving once again

Repeat Chorus (x2)

Repeat Bridge

Repeat Chorus (x2)

Outro:
If loving you is wrong
I don't want to be right now baby
(Repeat to fade)
