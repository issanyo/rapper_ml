[Intro: Puff Daddy]
This another one of them remixes
Come on, with your bad self
Rock on, with your bad self
Ha ha…that’s right
Come on, with your bad self
Rock on, with your bad self
That’s right
Come on, with your bad self
Rock on, with your bad self
Get down, with your bad self
Get up, with your bad self
Come on, with your bad self
Rock on, with your bad self
Get down, with your bad self
Get up, with your bad self
Come on, with your bad self
Come on, with your bad self
Rock on, with your bad self
Rock on, with your bad self
Come on, with your bad self
Get up, with your bad self
Get down, with your bad self
Come on, with your bad self

[Chorus]
I remember the way you used to love me (Remix)
I remember the days you used to love me (Come on)

[Verse 1]
You don't appreciate the time
I put into this love affair of ours, baby
I couldn't let you walk around
Thinking it's alright to let me down

[Chorus]
I remember the way you used to love me
(I remember, I remember)
I remember the way you used to love me
(Oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
I gave you all my precious love
And anything you wanted from me (Come on)
You didn't hear me calling out
For your affection after all this time
(Come on)

[Rap: Puff Daddy]
On the strength, I’mma keep the faith
I got money to waste, you could stay laced
In baguettes, ‘cause we gets what we wants, baby girl
How you feel going on a cruise around the world?
Playas be so butt they roll in an armored truck
That’s why I my let friends go
And out with the Benzo, with the bulletproof windows
I remember when you used to love me
Poppin’ bubbly, hottest thing in the club, G
VIP, sippin’ Dom, Lex on my arm
‘Cause everything I make be the bomb
Rappers, singers, players, and swingers
Pinky rings on our fingers, definitely bell ringers
(That’s right, that’s right)
Living life luxurious
And I remember the ways but you still got me curious
(Bad Boy)

[Bridge]
You didn't hear me calling out (Didn’t hear me)
And that's not what love's about (No, no)
I remember you used to love me
You used to love me every day (Every day, every day)
Now your love has gone away
I remember, I remember…

I remember, I remember
I remember the way you used to love me
(Repeat until end with ad-libs)
