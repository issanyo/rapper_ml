[Shyne]
Look at this nigga, stuntin in front of Justin's, actin silly
If it wasn't cops all over, I'd smack him with this milli
You ho niggas move a brick and think they rich
Get a few guns and a click and wanna take over shit
Ain't that the same kid that shot Reg in the head?
Turned him into a carrot, he might as well have been dead
Just came home from doin ten up in the Feds
Be extortin kingpins for they horse and they bread
Had the whole Brooklyn under pressure, I'm surprised he ain't test ya
Mad niggas know better
I ain't comin up offa, no cheddar, no bricks, no nothin
I'll kick that motherfucker, FUCK HIM, yeah I'll pay him somethin
Pay his ass a visit, blow his brains on the sidewalk
Let him collect his thoughts..
.. I'm the strongest force in New York
Til I'm a corpse, and even then, I'll be buried with bricks
And money-filled vaults, seventeen shots and two weeks later
I'm in the spot, takin it light
Watchin the Tyson fight it's packed, uh with killers and rats
Dope dealers, money hungry bitches, malicious
Cars pilin up the block for blocks nigga, Bentleys and 6's
This the place to be, where all the - gangsters meet
As I pick up my drink, I see my man Fat Pete
But before I could walk over, two niggas tapped him on the shoulder
And unloaded in his face, bullets flyin all over the place
Mirrors shatterin, people scatterin, his bodyguards shot back
Missed one but hit the other, in the abdomen, they both fled
But who the fuck would do somethin so - brazen and reckless?
Had to be some niggas tryin to send a message {*phone ringing*}
Next day I got a call from uptown to
Come have a meetin with The Council
Bout the shit that's been goin down
Word is, same kid that killed Fat Pete shot Reg in the head
Bottom line he's out of control, he got to be dead
He's startin to be a real problem
Extortin niggas, Brooklyn through Harlem
But he fucked around and crossed the margin, touched one of ours
He got to go, he from your hood, handle it Poe
Say no mo', I'm out the do'
Went back to the spot to grab the guns
Semi-auto check, AK-40 check, shotgun check, revolver - that's perfect
Called Tiz and told him meet me in an hour
Bring the caravan, you know the plan
Ski-masks and stockings, seen him down the ave. boppin
Him and a friend, just hopped in a Benz
Twenty inches on the rims, let's follow 'em slow, keep 'em in sight
Wait til he stop at a red light, then roll the window down
And kiss them bitches goodnight - they musta saw somethin
Cause the Benz busted U and came at us firin shots
I threw the revolver, grabbed the tec and left the driver's side wet
The Benz ran in a store window and got wrecked
I hopped out the van, ran up to the scene, still holdin the tec
One nigga's body was split in half, the other nigga still movin
Heard sirens comin closer, as I'm bout to shoot him
But fuck it, I opened his mouth, and let the tec spray
And told him tell Satan I'm on my way - die bitch
