[Intro]
Oh, no no no...

[Verse 1]
I know
That you're just a man
But you're all the man I need
And I know
That you care and you'll never leave
No, you'll never leave

[Chorus]
I love you so
I can't let go
You know it's real
The way I feel
I want to stay
I'll try to wait
On you my dear
My love's sincere

[Verse 2]
You promised
That you never would cheat or lie
Lie to me, don't lie to me babe
And you promised
That you'd trust and believe in me
Please believe in me

[Bridge]
Unnecessary pain (pain is pain)
Now tell me who would get the pain
(You know it hurts)
If we should go astray
What would we do
What could we say

[Chorus]
I love you so
I can't let go
You know it's real
The way I feel
I want to stay
I'll try to wait
On you my dear
My love's sincere

I love you so
I can't let go
You know it's real
The way I feel
I want to stay (I wanna stay)
I'll try to wait (I'll try to wait)
On you my dear (on you my dear)
My love's sincere (oh, oh)

I love you so (Baby you know, baby you know)
I can't let go (Baby you know, baby you know)
You know it's real (I wanna stay)
The way I feel (I wanna stay forever and a day)
I want to stay
I'll try to wait
On you my dear
My love's sincere

I love you so
I can't let go
You know it's real
The way I feel
I want to stay
I'll try to wait
On you my dear
My love's sincere

[Outro]
Why can't we work it out
Why baby? Can't we try (why, why, why, why, why)
You said our love would always stand the test of time

Why can't we work it out
Why baby? Can't we try
You said our love would always stand the test of time

Why can't we work it out
Why baby? Can't we try
You said our love would always stand the test of time

Why can't we work it out
Why baby? Can't we try
You said our love would always stand the test of time

Why can't we work it out
Why baby? Can't we try
You said our love would always stand the test of time

Why can't we work it out
Why baby? Can't we try
You said our love would always stand the test of time

Why can't we work it out
Why baby? Can't we try
You said our love would always stand the test of time

Why can't we work it out
Why baby? Can't we try
