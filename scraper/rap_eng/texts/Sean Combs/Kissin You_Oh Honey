Were                  scared of my charm at the carnival with teddy bears
In            your arms I like the whole package that come with your
Hips girl I even like the way that you lick your lips Im             the
Type of guy that gotta be in tha drivers seat take           you straight
To resorts just for privacy and Im a bad boy         and bad boys do
Bad things but if you kiss me right I put               some karats in
Your rings
(breakdown):Kiss all in the love I feel
Cause no other love feels so real(for you)
Just kiss me and you will you see
(My baby, my baby, my baby, my my baby)
In your arms is where I want to be(Yeah)
(chorus):In everday I keep feeling this way
What else can I say I wanna kiss you
I can't deny
What im feeling inside
Just you in my life let me kiss you
(outro):
Puffy:I wanna kiss you girl
Let me kiss ya girl
Can I kiss ya girl?

Can I kiss ya girl?
I wanna kiss you girl
