[Hook]
I don't know what, they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
[2X]

[Verse 1]
Tell me who's hot, who not?
I be chilling on the rooftop sippin' that Ciroc
I know that I'll never flop
Tell me who copped the first when it dropped
Excuse me for my flexing, but I gotta execute the Flexicution
The same old pimp, Cavin
Ain't nothing change but the bank account
I slip out of the trash label situation
August 17 a classic on my count
Right now you hearing the flow leading up to Cavin Sinatra
I can guarantee another tape as hot as sriracha
Girl don't come up to me like you know me
I will dismiss you like everybody do to me
Not dissing anybody, but sometimes I gotta make it interesting
Not name dropping in The Game
I'm here setting up my lane
I see you cutie and you know I see that booty
Soon you be yellin "oh my god it's Cavin" and then I'll give you a dose of my juicy


[Verse 2]
I-A-M-C-A-V-I-N, no way I'ma kill that
You mad cause I killed that
I know you been waiting for the tape to drop
On top of the scene, stay clean with a blue dream
I say that I'm the king of the Agg
Cause it's true when it come to the rap
I will continue even after I stack
Smoke in air, girls on my controller
Play the Gameboy no Nintendo
Write too much, I rap too much
Step on stage, the girls go too nuts
I guess I don't run with lame dudes that much
I'll never lose my grip on this game
The flow so cold it froze the window pane
Everybody acting the same
I'm unpredictable, change flows till the last syllable
There ain't nobody like me that can turn you on
I'm the one you been afraid of
I'm the one you been waiting on
I'm the one you been putting off
Just know that I got the juice if you want it
I also got them long nights too if you want it
I'm undercover like a secret agent
You know I'm never complacent
I'm deep in the rubble
These motherfuckers want to cause trouble
There is nothing above it
Nobody do it like I does it
Cause everybody to me is considered combusted
