[Verse 1]
It's been a long time
And I hope you're doing fine
I just wanted to write you a letter
Saying 'hi' and explaining why
Why you mean so much to me
Well, the reason is plain, you see
You were always there when I needed you
And I wanted to let you know

[Chorus]
You've gotta be strong
And it won't be long
'Cause I'm gonna do
All your time with you
I promise you I can and I will do
Your time with you
I'm gonna do your time with you
No matter what I gotta do

[Verse 2]
I always did believe
That our love would be
Stronger than the bars you were behind
And my heart always seems to find
Find a reason to hold on
And a purpose to be strong
Baby, can't you see that I need you
And I know that you need me, too

[Chorus]
You've gotta be strong
And it won't be long
'Cause I'm gonna do
All your time with you
Promise you I can and I will do
Your time with you
I'm gonna do your time with you
No matter what I gotta do
You've gotta be strong
And it won't be long
'Cause I'm gonna do
All your time with you
Promise you I can and I will do
Your time with you
I'm gonna do your time with you
No matter what I gotta do

[Bridge]
And I'm writing with sincerity, yeah
Just to make you understand what you mean to me
And I can't wait 'til you come home
But I need you to be strong, baby, hold on
Hold on, 'cause I'm down for you, baby, yeah yeah
You know I'm gonna do, I'll do your time with you
I'm gonna do your time with you
Baby, I'm down with you
No matter what I gotta do

[Chorus]
You've gotta be strong
And it won't be long
'Cause I'm gonna do
All your time with you
Promise you I can and I will do
Your time with you
I'm gonna do your time with you
No matter what I gotta do
You've gotta be strong
And it won't be long
'Cause I'm gonna do
All your time with you
Promise you I can and I will do
Your time with you
I'm gonna do your time with you
No matter what I gotta do
