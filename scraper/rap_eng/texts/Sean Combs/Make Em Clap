[Verse 1]
Look I'm..I'm flipping, I'm whiling
I'm losing my marbles
Come to the ghetto no money you making me hostile
Rebel and .. is the monster willing you gospel
The lion and cage the animal fit in the jungle
Better the better is the man in the school
Best could've been the..who I'm doing to get em
Damn it I'm dumming I've on dodge to the..
This is finish you ..if you jazz
If some of you listen the shit that I'm doing the..
24 hours..damn I am in charge
And I am the.. rapping this regular humans

Until I see no..in the mastic card
Even a visa I ain't worried by a diva

Well I'm disappearing like two clock..

[Verse 2]

I burn as a down meet me at..
Fall my life rap, my life nigga rap
..flow make em, make em clap

Her dealers ..hunger and taking me under
I'm something like automatic when I'm taking the summer
I'm something..and I'm still your thunder
..drown by the summer
The level is the women that with me
I go on my closet I dress like a woman
Before you act nigga rebel who your born
I'm vacating..visit and more
While my nigga invisible that you bro
I push them to the metal of ..
With my rackets pop so vision on tour
..to the bad guy, I'm..the man high
You man high, you niggas need a photo
And I wish by land yeah
