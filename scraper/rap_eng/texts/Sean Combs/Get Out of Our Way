[Intro: Blake C]
B.I.G. nigga
Forever and ever
Yeah
You know by now
By now you know
You know, my name
What is it?
Blake C
Brooklyn
If ya don't know
We bring the thunder, thunder
I said I'm here now
And I'm never gone

[Verse 1: Larceny]
Know what I'm sayin
We goin do it like this
Yo, yo, yo
Larc Vegas banger
Till they took my jet plane, cliffhanger
Fuck it
Yeah he crashed my plane
That ain't nothin but change
Throwin niggas through windows
Head on like freight trains
Chicks hit it the same
Our slogan:
Bullets don't have no names
And how we keep our circle tight
We shake off the lanes
Thats primo
And when Blake say so
Have ya family ridin
Behind the Hearse and Limo
Guess who in the last car
System knocked like a disco
Thinkin B.I.G., thinkin Chris
Bumpin "Missing You"
It's all about the cash flow
Get up in they asshole
When you spit, just give em a taste
That's hotter than Tabasco
See, ever since I was a little rascal
Uh, never was bashful
To let out more nuts than cashew
Was swarmed by so many honeys
You thought I did taboo
Well baby, it's natural
With charm is how I grasp you
God bless me
When a nigga ha-choo
When a nigga ha-choo
When a nigga ha-choo
God bless me
When a nigga ha-choo

[Chorus: Blake C]
Get out our way, get out our way
Ya'll betta pray, niggas betta pray
I told ya I was comin, I told ya we were coming (B.I.G. style)
Ya best to start runnin, Ya best to start runnin
Can't move the way we move
Never move the way we move
We're too clever, clever, clever, clever, clever

[Verse 2: Lil Cease]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
This rap shit, I'm the father
Your biological
The infrared on it, It ain't hard to find you
Even, larger dudes get smashed at barbecues
Security house, cameras that monitor you
My bitches freak nasty in front of you
If I give her the word, she'll swallow a few
Gargle it too
Cease game stick like glue
Crazy, a lotta you tell
You never forgave me
My ice grain like, shine on the shammy????
My thugs come in a bunch, but not the Bradys
Go to war, like niggas in Haiti
No if, ands or maybe
Not up going to school, just lazy
Fuck the chickens
I trick dick to the ladies
Come with the force thats greatly
My stash go in the safe with the key
Don't be mad at what God made me
Muthafuckas

[Chorus: Blake C]
Get out our way, get out our way
Ya'll betta pray, niggas betta pray
I told ya I was comin, I told ya we were coming
Ya best to start runnin, Ya best to start runnin
Can't move the way we move
Never move the way we move
We're too clever, clever, clever, clever, clever (Puffy - It's my turn now)

[Verse 3: Puff Daddy]
Sean Jean
I shines
I floss
Beget it out with the platinum cross
My own boss
What's the price, fuck the cost
See a bitch, fuck a bitch
Get head, get tossed
While ya cats fight for front page in the Source
I'm Beat Boys, Status, P-D, People's Choice
Powdered for Bentley
Simply
Doing fifty, gently
Bad Boy industry, nigga
Please don't tempt me
Present me
Only to the top swiftly
Quickly
I'm talking to the ones that envy
I advise ya'll
Get money, and get wis-er
My team
Like the newest quasars, blaze ya'll
We got our guards up, raise ya'll
Your chips minor, mine major
Soon to be comin for a beat to save ya'll
What

[Chorus: Blake C (Puffy)]
Get out our way, get out our way
Ya'll betta pray, niggas betta pray
I told ya I was comin, I told ya we was coming
Ya best to start runin, Ya best to start runnin
Can't move the way we move
Never move the way we move
We're too clever, clever, clever, clever, clever
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, times up now)
Get out our way, get out our way (We're here now)
Ya'll betta pray, niggas betta pray (Took a little break)
I told ya I was comin, I told ya we was coming (But we back)
Ya best to start runnin, Ya best to start runnin (Been a long time comin)
Can't move the way we move (Lil Cease)
Never move the way we move (Junior M.A.F.I.A.)
We're too clever, clever, clever, clever, clever (Queen Bee, Lil Kim)
Get out our way, get out our way (D-Roc, the General)
Ya'll betta pray, niggas betta pray (Bris', Banger)
I told ya I was comin, I told ya we were coming (Blake)
Ya best to start runnin, Ya best to start runnin
(That nigga, P. Ditty. Yeah that's me)
Can't move the way we move (Mase)
Never move the way we move (B.I.G. forever)
We're too clever, clever, clever, clever, clever (And we won't stop)
