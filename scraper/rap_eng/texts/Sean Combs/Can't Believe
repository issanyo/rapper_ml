Uh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Emotional

I always dreamed that everything
Would be okay with me and you but I was wrong
When I looked into your eyes
I didn't see all the things I used to see what's going on?

You gave me reason to believe that
We were always meant to be but now I see, you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those, "Baby, baby, pleases" no more, no more

Never imagined you would be
A painted picture, I'm emotional
You saw me leaving, no deceiving
It's official, I'm emotional

I can't forget that night I saw you
In the corner wrapped up tight, you were wrong, ooh
Slow dancing on the floor while I was
Watching from the door, so hurt, there you were

You gave me reason to believe that
We were always meant to be but now I see, you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those, "Baby, baby, pleases", no more, no more

Never imagined you would be
A painted picture, I'm emotional
You saw me leaving, no deceiving
It's official, I'm emotional

You had your chance but you through it all away
Thought you had my love always
Oh baby, I don't understand
Why you think that we could stay in total unhappiness?

Never imagined you would be
A painted picture, I'm emotional
You saw me leaving, no deceiving
It's official, I'm emotional

Never imagined you would be
A painted picture, I'm emotional
You saw me leaving, no deceiving
It's official, I'm emotional

Never imagined you would be
A painted picture, I'm emotional
