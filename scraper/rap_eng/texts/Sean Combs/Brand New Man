[Verse 1]
She never had respect for me
She knew I had a family
But I blame it all on you
She used to be a friend to me
And now I can't stand to see
Her when she comes around
See, both of y'all let me down
And now it's all over town
How could you do me that way? Oh baby

[Chorus]
Now that I got me a brand new man
You can't even understand
She's been wondering where we stand
I ain't got time, you can have that man
Now that I got me a brand new home
I don't have to be alone
Got somebody who understands
I got a brand new man

[Verse 2]
See, everything was cool with us
But you took advantage of my trust
You crossed my faith in you, yes you did
He used to belong to me, how silly could you both be
I knew it all the time, yeah yeah yeah yeah
I never thought you would do those things you did
Are you even concerned what I told the kids?
(What I told the kids? Because I cried; yes, I cried, baby)
Now it don't matter 'cause baby I'm over you
Can't forgive you for the stress you put me through
But what goes around comes right back around again, yeah

[Chorus]
Now that I got me a brand new man
You can't even understand
She's been wondering where we stand
I ain't got time you can have that man
Now that I got me a brand new home
I don't have to be alone
Got somebody who understands
I got a brand new man

[Bridge]
If you ever been hurt, keep your head up

If you ever been hurt, keep your head up
If you been hurt, keep your head up, keep it up
If you ever been hurt, keep your head up
If you been hurt, keep your head up, you'll find love
If you ever been hurt, keep your head up
If you been hurt, keep your head up, keep it up
If you ever been hurt, keep your head up
If you been hurt, keep your head up, you'll find love
If you ever been hurt, keep your head up
If you been hurt, keep your head up, keep it up
If you ever been hurt, keep your head up
If you been hurt, keep your head up, you'll find love
If you ever been hurt, keep your head up
If you been hurt, keep your head up, keep it up
