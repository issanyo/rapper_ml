[Verse 1]
Time on my hands, since you been away boy
I ain't got no plans, no no no no
And the sound of the rain, against my windowpane
Is slowly, is slowly drivin' me insane, boy

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
'Cause you ain't around, baby
My whole world's upside down

[Verse 2]
Sleep don't come easy, boy please believe me
Since you been gone, everything's goin' wrong
Why'd you have to say, “Goodbye”, look what you've done to me
I can't stop these tears from fallin' from my eyes, oh baby

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
'Cause you ain't around, baby
My whole world's upside down

[Bridge]
Ooh, baby love
Goin' down, goin' down
I'm goin' down
Ooh I, I

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
'Cause you ain't around, baby
My whole world's upside down

[Verse 3]
Ooh, goin' down, goin' down
Oh, I don't know what to do
If I ever lose you, I'll be goin' down
I said, “I'll be goin' down”
Oh, please forgive me, baby
I'm so sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
What did I do wrong?
I said, “What did I do wrong?”
Please forgive me, baby, and come on home
Goin' down
Goin' down
Goin' down
