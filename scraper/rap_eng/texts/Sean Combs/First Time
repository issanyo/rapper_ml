[Intro: Diddy]
I feel, I'm askin', I'm askin' first and foremost, guys, I'm askin'
Haven't I given to this culture?
Will there be you without me
Did I not deserve this, did I not deserve this? Did I not show you?
How to ball?
Did I not muthauckin' go to war for us?

[Verse: French Montana]
First billion dollar bitch from California
First brick came from Arizona
First slang came from the corner
First chain, nigga had to pawn it
My first pot, man you wouldnâ€™t pee in
Damn, my first car came European
My first flight was a Visa plan
My first trip was on Peter Pan
My first deal, man it raped me, nigga
My first bitch prolly hate me, nigga
My first case cost me 80, nigga
My first Mac & Cheese went crazy, nigga
My first mil drove me crazy, nigga
My first homies changed on me, never changed me, nigga
First time got high rollin' wavy, nigga
First time I prayed to God like take me withcha
First time I got broke I was chasin' bitches
First time I givin' signs, I was chasin' niggas
First time I met Ross made real figures
First time I met Puff was through a real nigga
First time I flipped packs, nigga
Was the first time I hit sacks, nigga
First time I hit the strips, made real money
First time rolled the die, lost my reup money
First time he did bis' where he first lived
With his first will, never seen his first kid
First time he seen real money when he flippin' crack
First time I heard Pac, fell in love with rap
First time I blacked out, seen my mama cried
First time I strapped up, nigga gotta die
First time I got shot is what made me, nigga
First time started thinkin' like  I was eatin', nigga
First idol I seen was a drug dealer
First rifle with the beam for you lil niggas
First time went broke, I ain't seen nobody
First time I went pickle, had to cry about it

[Outro: Diddy]
You know, meanin' is somethin' in this game
That's hard, that's gon' be hard to do
Cause first of all, some gettin' too much money out here doin' too many things
I need some shit that'll grab their attention niggas, and love right away
