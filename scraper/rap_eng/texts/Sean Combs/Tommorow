[Diddy]
My cup is half full
I’m sipping on Ciroc and Red Bull
(Come on)
I’m feeling amplified
Somebody’s girl is goin’ get f-cked tonight
(Tonight)
See I just grab her arm
Hey pretty girl, no need to be alarmed, no
Cause I just wanna make you feel good
Better than you ever did, dont mean no harm
(No)

[Bridge: Diddy]
Hey baby girl, you’re a shining star
So let’s make a movie and play your part
You’re looking ready, to free your soul
So come home with me, let’s lose control

[Hook: Diddy]
Oh, let’s not think about tomorrow, tonight
Just live the moment
Oh, let’s not think about tomorrow, tonight

(So what’s the hold up? Scared, scared? c’mon)

[Verse 2: Diddy]
Now we at my condo
All the way up on the top floor
It’s time to take a toast
And see you come in out them clothes
Girl you’re smoking?
You got me high, tell me, is your rollin’?
I can get you whatever you need
Tell me what is gonna take to keep this party going
Don’t stop

[Bridge: Diddy]
Baby girl, you’re a shining star
So let’s make a movie and play your part
You’re looking ready, to free your soul
So come home with me, let’s lose control

[Hook: Diddy]
Oh, let’s not think about tomorrow, tonight
Just live the moment
Let’s not think about tomorrow, tonight
Just live the moment
Let’s not think about tomorrow, tonight
Just live the moment
Let’s not think about tomorrow, tonight

[Ludacris]
Hold up, pour it up, throw it up, roll it up in the papers
And the put your swishes in the air
Put your drinks up, and we goin’ wave ‘em all around
In the sky like we just don’t care
Get the speakers loud as we can get ‘em with the bass and the Treble to put the track on smash
Turn me up in the headphones, these women ready for lift off so Put my voice on blast!
Mags, we strapped with it
Cash, stacked with it
Pull up on a female and attack with it
Got ass? Come back wit’ it
‘Cause you’re looking like a butter milk biscuit
Picture perfect for the paps just pose
And when we start going in this club
You go start coming out the clothes

[Hook: Diddy]
Oh, let’s not think about tomorrow, tonight
Just live in the moment
Let’s not think about tomorrow, tonight
