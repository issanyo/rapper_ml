[Verse 1 - Aundrea]
Waiting to see the light
Been waiting all my life
Show me a way
Won't you show me a way

[Dawn]
I wanna come out of the dark
But breaking away is so hard
Show me a way
Just show me a way

[Pre-Chorus Aubrey]
Show me which way to go
Can't do this by myself
Can't do it (oh oh no)
Don't know how I should play
The cards that I've been dealt
Can't do it

[Chorus - Danity Kane]
Is anybody listening?
Can anybody answer my prayers?
Please say yes
Does anybody feel the same?
And is there anybody who cares?
Life's unfair, it's so unfair

[Verse 2 - Aubrey]
I want something more than this
I've given all I can give
Show me the way
Won't you show me the way

[D. Woods]
I just wanna feel I belong
I just need the strength to be strong
Show me a way
Won't you show me a way

[Pre-Chorus Shannon]
Show me which way to go
Can't do this all alone
I can't do this all alone
Don't feel like I know how
To make it on my own

[Chorus - Danity Kane]
Is anybody listening?
Can anybody answer my prayers?
Please say yes
Does anybody feel the same?
And is there anybody who cares?
Life's unfair, it's so unfair

[Dawn:]
Is anybody listening

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Is anybody listening
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Can you hear me
Show me
Is anybody listening?

[Chorus - Danity Kane]
Is anybody listening?
Can anybody answer my prayers?
Please say yes
Does anybody feel the same?
And is there anybody who cares?
Life's unfair, it's so unfair

Is anybody listening?
Can anybody answer my prayers?
Please say yes
Does anybody feel the same?
And is there anybody who cares?
Life's unfair, it's so unfair
