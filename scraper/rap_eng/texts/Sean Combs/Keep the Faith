[Verse 1]
I've seen the lightning flashing, heard the thunder roll, roll
I feel the cold winds blowing
Trying to conquer my soul

[Chorus]
If I just hold my peace
Let the Lord fight my battles
If I keep the faith through the night
And if I just...

[Verse 2]
I hear the voice of reason
Telling me to fight on
'Cause I know I've come to far to turn around
Weeping may endure for a night
But joy is gonna come tomorrow
Though I go through the fire
I shall come out as pure gold

[Bridge]
When problems come just keep the faith
It won't be long until the day
Things will turn around if you just
Just stand your ground

[Chorus]
If I just hold my peace
Let the Lord fight my battles
If I just keep the faith through the night
If I just hold my peace
Let the Lord fight my battles
(I don't have to fight no more)
If I just keep the faith through the night
(through the night, through the night, through the night)

[Bridge]
When problems come just keep the faith
It won't be long until the day
Things will turn around if you just
Just stand your ground

[Outro]
I only have to keep the faith
(I only have to keep the faith)
I only have to keep the faith
(I don't have to fight no more, no no no)
I only have to keep the faith
I only have to keep the faith
(I only have to keep the faith)
I only have to keep the faith
(The faith, the faith)
I only have to keep the faith
(I'm gonna keep the faith)
I only have to keep the faith
(Keep the faith through the night)
I only have to keep the faith
I only have to keep the faith
(Come too far to turn around)
I only have to keep the faith
(Joy is gonna come tomorrow)
I only have to keep the faith
I only have to keep the faith
I only have to keep the faith
(I'm gonna keep it, I've gotta keep it)
I only have to keep the faith
('Cause I've never seen the righteous forsaken)
I only have to keep the faith
I only have to keep the faith
I only have to keep the faith
I only have to keep the faith
I only have to keep the faith
I only have to keep the faith
