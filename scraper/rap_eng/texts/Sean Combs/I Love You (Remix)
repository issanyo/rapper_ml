[Intro: Smif-n-Wessun]
This is how we do...every day all day
This is how we do, this is how we do
Smif-n-Wessun don't play
This is how we do...every day all day
This is how we do, this is how we do
Click click click, in the night

[Break: Smif-n-Wessun] (x5)
I shine, you shine, shine

[Verse 1: Smif-n-Wessun]
[In this day and time
We maintain the same frame of mind
Elevation, spark it up
Yo, start the circulation, 360 degrees in rotation
Stimulation, as the herb bless my physical creation
Slip into a hallucination
Situations, got me thinking about my life seriously
Keep it real continuously
Before I slip into blackness I prepare for combat
Protect my dome 'cause that's where my home's at
Crack my windows, inhale as the mist blows
Build up my mental, construct on my physical
Spreading love to my Brooklyn crew (Who be you?)]
Bad boys, Smif-n-Wessun, comin' through
Tek and Steele, travelin' through the battle and
Handlin' all that is challengin' to the very end

[Hook: Smif-n-Wessun]
This is how we do
This is how we do, everyday all day
This is how we do, this is how we do
Smif-n-Wessun we don't play
This is how we do, this is how we do
When we get down with Mary J
This is how we do, this is how we do
Click click click...

[Hook: Mary J. Blige] (x2)
All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record
I love you, I love you

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
When I found out you were leaving me
I couldn't sleep thinkin' about
All the things that we've been through
Now all I want to do is tell you that I miss you
So much (you know I really really miss you)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] (x2)
All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record
I love you, I love you

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige]
Now that I'm on my own
I know, that in time I'll find somebody
That'll treat me better than you
So I go on my own, without you
But I still love you (you know I'll never live without you)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] (x2)
All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record
I love you, I love you

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I wish you change your way soon enough
So we can be together
You just don't understand your love
But now all we have is memories

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] (x2)
All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record
I love you, I love you

[Verse 4: Smif-n-Wessun]
Hip-hop, sets out in the park
Blaze an L, raisin' hell 'til the day got dark
Got me reminiscing back like Mary J
When I sit back and peep the games people play
Too high to get over 'cause I'm rolling through life like a soldier
Holding the weight of my fate on my shoulder
Blazing the trees with my Duck Down family
P-N-C, One L-O-V-E

[Outro: Smif-n-Wessun]
You know how we do
This is how we do every day all day
This is how we do when we get down with Mary J
This is how we do, this is how we do
Smif-n-Wessun we don't play
This is how we do, when we break day
