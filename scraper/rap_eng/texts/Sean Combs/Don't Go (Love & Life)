[Verse 1]
Every day is not a perfect day for you and I some days
Some things are just not right
That doesn't mean that I don't love you
And boy you know it’s true
I cannot always please you
When I look into your eyes
(When I look into your eyes)
I always see myself
That means that we are one
No one else can satisfy this girl the way you do
I know that love makes all the rules

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I say things to hurt you
But I'll apologize
Neither one of us are perfect
So you should realize

[Chorus]
Don't go, baby (I need you)
Baby, don't you go
Don't go, baby
I still love you so

[Verse 2]
Don't act that way if I ask you to stay
Please don't walk away from me, baby
Give me the same respect that you want from me
(Why don't you?)
‘Cause Lord knows that I deserve it too

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I say things to hurt you
But I'll apologize
Neither one us of are perfect
So you should realize

[Chorus 2X]
Don't go, baby
Baby, don't you go
Don't go, baby
I still love you so
Don't go, baby
Baby, don't you go
Don't go, baby
I still love you so

[Bridge]
We all know we make mistakes
Sometimes we’re not always gonna get along
(We’re not gonna get along but I love you, yeah)
So stop wasting all your time thinking that I don't love you
‘Cause if love makes the rules, no one gets played for a fool

[Chorus (Repeat until end with ad-libs)]
Don't go, baby
Baby, don't you go
Don't go, baby
I still love you so
Don't go, baby
Baby, don't you go
Don't go, baby
I still love you so
