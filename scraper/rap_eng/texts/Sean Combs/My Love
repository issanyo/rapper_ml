[Verse 1]
I was a fool to let you in
Knowing you would play with my heart
But that was so long ago that I thought we could make a new start
You left me broken hearted from the day your love departed
Now that I love you I’m with someone new you’re gone
And so you wanna come back

[Chorus]
Whatcha gonna do without my love, my love?
Whatcha gonna do now that my love is gone away from you

[Verse 2]
Sweet memories of yesterday when it all seemed so right
I was loving you, kissing you, holding you tight
I wish you know that woman that you learned to leave today
And it’s a shame that you wanna come back now baby
My love is gone away

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I’d make a fool for ya baby
And you stole away my heart
Now that my love is gone away
Sweet memories of yesterday
Now that my love is gone away

[Chorus]
