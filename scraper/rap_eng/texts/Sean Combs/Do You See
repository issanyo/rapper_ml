[Puff Daddy]
Yo Puff Daddy
Get off me
Ladies & gentlemen
You're about to witness something that you've never witnessed before
Sauce Money's in the house & he brought his man with him

I leave rap in a state of shock
Where to rock, from the figures still
Play the block with my niggas
Ill lush, game 20 pounds, but all my niggas still crush
Still stack chips galore
Chicks want out the ghetto, try to hit you raw
Better know that everything I love - roll back
Cop my first gold plaque, soon as my man blew
Still spittin' the fly, hits you can't do nigga
You ain't gainin', you game in, barely maintainin'
I push fly whips without strainin', my cliques smother
Get tougher, hits rougher, Puff is deep in the streets like Chris Tucker
My wrists cluster, on a mobile
P-Diddy, rap mogul, thought I told you that we don't stop
Thought I told you that when I drop, platinum plaques
I cop, push Bentley's without the tops, nigga

[Hook] (Puff Daddy)

Try to see if you see what I see
Give my game & spit my G
When it's all done, stack, funds, & I'm the one
On top is where I be
Tell me, do you see what I see?
(When I look in your eyes, I see you hatin' inside, so tell me)
Do you see what I see?
(I know you're hopin' I'm blind, cause you don't want me to shine)

[Sauce Money]
No secret, undefeated, I'm top seeded
Whenever I drop hits, you don't want it, you need it
This a hot joint from Sauce, you feel cheated
Unanimous decision, love the way I freak it
Brooklyn, shogun, beat the 4-1
Niggas want to bite off my flow son
I don't think no one, got that, rock a hot track
Like me, nice to the Sauce? Naw
Spit rounds, it's rough did I mention the thorough?
BK forever representin' my borough
Push fly whips, quick to stack my chips
Too easy for you to understand my hits
When the album drops every pocket hold some
Sauce motherfuckin' forever, I told son
Hypnotic, heard the ? war 'fore I shot it
Better cop it, cause all that fly shit, I got it

(Chorus)

[PD]
I took rap by the throat & locked it
P-Diddy fixed all those who tried to stop it
Some of y'all tried to blast off, but couldn't rock it
If my flow ain't like a door, how could you knock it?

[Sauce Money] (PD)
As a matter of fact, yo don't you hate that? (hate that)
Whenever cats playa hatin' from way back (way back)
Mad at you, just because they whack (they whack)
And I bought your style, older than 8-track (8-track)

[PD]
Only way to react though
Make hot joints & stack dough
Laughin' at your whack flow
Try to catch my G
Just so you can rap like me
Act like me

[SM]
Rap like me
But it seems as though you dreamin' a lot
(PD)
I'm the cream of the crop
[SM]
Soon to be seen in the drop
(PD)
Blow the spot for the not
[SM]
Control the block, watch his name bubble like a soda pop
(PD)
When he drop

(Chorus 4X)
