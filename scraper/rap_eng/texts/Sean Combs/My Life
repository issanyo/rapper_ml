[Hook] x4
If you looked at my life
And see what I see

[Verse 1]
Life can be only what you make it
When you're feeling down you should never fake it
Say what's on your mind and you'll find in time
That all the negative energy, it would all decease
And you'll be at peace with yourself
You won't really need no one else
Except for the man up above
Because He'll give you love

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Take your time, baby don't you rush a thing
Don't you know I know we all are struggling
I know it is hard, but we will get by
And if you don't believe in me, just believe in "He"
Cause He'll give you peace of mind (Yes He would)
And you'll see the sunshine (For real, yes you would)
And you'll get to free your mind
And things will turn out fine
Oh, I know that things will turn out fine
Yes they would, yes they would

[Hook]

[Outro]
All you got to do is
Take your time, one day at a time
It's all on you, what you gonna do?
