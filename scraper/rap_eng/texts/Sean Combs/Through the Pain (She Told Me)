[Diddy]
Can you feel me?
Diddy can you touch me?
Can you trust me?
Can you love me?
I need you
Rio... talk to 'em

[Mario]
I could tell how you doubted me
I knew my heart was broken
And so empty
Even though my girl was next to me
She didn't see
I do believe
That you wanna come by
Rescue me
If you read my mind
I have set you a place
I wonder if I'll just will be
In time we'll see
She told me

She told me
She showed me
But she hurt me
Yet she loved me the same
Has anybody ever made you feel that way?
Could you really love her through the pain?

[Diddy]
...yeah
When I don't wanna feel this way (this way)
I got too many bills to pay (to pay)
I'm hangin on Patron all day (Aye)
Mind in a maze (maze)
Blowing on shit
I can't function
It gotta be something (go ahead)
That you doing
That got me unconscious (aye)
All this money this fame this fire
How could I feel this empty inside? (talk to 'em)

[Mario]
I've been thinkin 'bout giving up (can't give up)
But there's something inside me that's holding on
When we don't know who's right or wrong
We still stay strong
Keep movin' on (Don't stop)
And I promise I will never leave
Now would you do the same for me?
I wonder if I'll just will be
In time we'll see
She told me

[Mario]
She told me
She showed me
But she hurt me
Yet she loved me the same
Has anybody ever made you feel that way?
Could you really love her through the pain?

[Diddy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fine as hell
Fly chanel (so fly)
But will it last?
Only time will tell (only time)
Love is real
And what I mean is
There's not enough word to explain the meanin (C'mon)
And what I'm saying is
All I need is for you to understand
How beautiful she is (she is)
And all it takes is a little faith
And no matter the situation
In my heart you'll Stay

[Mario] + (Diddy)
I'll always be your friend
You'll always be my girl (I'll always love you)
I'll never let it end
For nothing in the world (you'll never stop me)
Cause no one else can do
The things you do (no one else do the things)
You make me feel (you make me feel)
So warm and new
So would you stay with me? (she told me)

[Mario] + (Diddy)
She told me (she showed me)
She showed me (but she hurt)
But she hurt me (yet she loved me)
Yet she loved me the same (all the same)
Has anybody ever made you feel that way?
(has anybody... ever made you feel that way?)
Could you really love her through the pain? (could you?)

[Diddy]
Thank you for showing me how to love
Thank you for showing me

[Mario]
Girl you mean the world to me
Just a little more than I can see
Breaks us down
We'd stay together
Only we can hustle who ever
Would you come and go with me
To fulfill our fantasies
Take me by my hand my dear
Promise me you won't have no fear

[Mario] + (Diddy)
She told me (she showed me)
She showed me (but she hurt me)
But she hurt me (yet she loved me)
Yet she loved me the same (all the same)
Has anybody ever made you feel that way?
(has anybody... ever made you feel that way?)
Could you really love her through the pain? (could you?)
