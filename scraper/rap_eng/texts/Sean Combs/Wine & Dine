Verse 1:
We always chill at my place
And without a doubt its satisfaction on ya' face
But sometimes
I know what'son your mind
You just wanna do something a little different for a change
You know, something like gourmet
No need to sweat the expense, baby I'll pay
Anything for you
Ain't there a spot that you wanna go to
Its probly real expensive
What they sell there; tofu?
I'm kiddin'
I know you like seafood
And I don't mean to be rude but baby me too
Any, we'll talk about that later
This is one of them nights when you relax and I cater
You know, a restaurant with a waiter
Could almost swear that I make some good paper
Shit
But its quite the contrary
Rarely do you see a nigga out like yearly
I guess its just that time of year
So gone pick ya' dress out and gone fix ya'hair
Put on that pretty blue laced underwear
Or better yet surprise me with nothin' at all
Yea
I'm a gentleman, let me help you with ya' chair
Candle light will make it real hard not to stare
Quality time with you, nothin' compares
For the moment, let's make our problems disappear

Hook:
I know you used to us stayin' home a lot
We're so used to the life of the havenots
Yea you say you don't mind
But I'd be lyin' if I said you don't deserve some wine & dine
Even if its only
Once in a while
A lil' somethin' special for ya'
You deserve the finer thing, I can assure ya'
And I know I don't got much
Except all of this love stuff
I just hope that its enough
To keep us

Verse 2:
As we, savor the flavor of this conversation
I'm realizing that everything about you is just so stimulating
Lickin' my lips is a reflex
Yea the food is good but its based on what I ain't had to eat yet
I would much rather, you on my plate
Finger food, no forks and spoons needed to initiate
Time's flying and its gettin' late
And every single word I utter, is beginning to resonate
With you
Evokin' warm feelings' physically and mentally
Got you feeling like this is ya' destiny
This was meant to be, you was meant for me
And we in public baby, so you better quit temptin' me
I'm just happy to see you smile
Like a candy who discovered child
Shit, I mean like a child who discovered candy
Showin' all ya' teeth, I know everything is fine and dandy
Its a shame that this has to end
But I give you my word that we'll do it again
I don't know when
But I know that it'll be worth the wait
And you don't even gatta say it
I know this is the part you hate
This moment is bittersweet
Just pray for better days when you go to sleep
And maybe one day we'll wake up together
After that I don't really see how it could get much better

Hook:
I know you used to us stayin' home a lot
We're so used to the life of the have nots
Yea you say you don't mind
But I'd be lyin' if I said you don't deserve some wine & dine
Even if its only
Once in a while
A lil' somethin' special for ya'
You deserve the finer thing, I can assure ya'
And I know I don't got much
Except all of this love stuff
I just hope that its enough
To keep us
