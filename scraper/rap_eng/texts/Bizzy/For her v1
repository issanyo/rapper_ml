Wanna make pâ€™s ahh
Make you lean like the tower piza
I like mona lisa
But i won't paint her pic like i need her
She a keeper
She said please ah
Can i meet ya
I wear nike but im not a geeza
Not a drug dealer
But im a earner
She a learner
Dont need to dip the phone ain't got a burner
Dont wanna do the job issa murder
Dont wanna die
Dont wanna fly
Dont wanna get that high
Where i can't see the sky
Are you gonna ride
You hurt me once i will let that slide
Might link bethany
She brings out the best in me
Dont get her mixed up with stephanie
Dont wanna bring back all the memories
Trapped in my mind im going insane
Dunno how to deal with this pain
My lifes stuck in 5th lane
All these bad thoughts running through my brain
I got a migrane
Numb it when i buy a new chain
Shout out to harry kane
Hops in his private airplane
Put the needle in my vein
Dont wanna hear your excuses again
No need to worry bout the bloodstain
Crack open the champagne
Got another victory
Dont matter what they did to me
Never knew the troubles she would give to me
Her name was kylie she sipped on her iced tea
Then she went, didn't say bye to me
She lied to me
