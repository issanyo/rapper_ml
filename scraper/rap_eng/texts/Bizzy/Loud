[Hook:]
Yeah I play my music LOUD!
I betcha you feel me coming down the block
The thunder in the trunk gon' knock
You know I play my music LOUD!
And yup I got the neighbors losing sleep
From the way I crank it up and let it beat

[Verse 1: Alan Wayne Tha Pradagy]
Pulled up in a bucket, blowing on a blunt
Beat hittin like brrrump bump bump
Crack I crease sound like a big bitch
In the back trying get up out a little nigga trunk
Turn heads for I even hit the block
Lil kids running up when they hear the beat knock
Crank it to the max whenever I pass cops
Heart skip a beat whenever the bass drop
My shit is quakin got my rearview vibrating
Pulled up next to my gran mammy at the red light got her wig shaking
Hennessey & purple is what I'm tasting
Finna do some baby making
Gotta chop that freak sitting next to me
Bitch look like Sanaa Lathan
Hey sunday morning 'round eleven roll by interupting in the reverend
I'll probably lose my hearing by the time I'm twenty-seven
It's a shame
But I need that bang
To vibrate my frame
ABS my game
Have to do a little switch up can a a player get strange
I tell my biatrice to quit yappin later on we gon' get nasty
You can do whatever you like to me, we can do classy or get trashy
Matter fact we ain't even gotta go to the crib girl we can do it in the back seat
For now sit back relax and let this beat massage your ass cheeks

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Prada]

Hungry little nigga 'bout ta eat till the plate is gone
Gotta flamer on, 'bout to step into the danger zone
Mind as well go ahead and call the cops
Cause 'em loud ass next door neighbors is home

That why these niggas mock us but they not us, and it not just
Music with me and my partners, we done put time in this bitch so how can you stop us

For the woman and the niggas in the city that said

You motherfuckers shouldn't have nothing to say now
Gotta middle finger for yall scratch that I ain't even thinkin' of ya'll Pass that
So pass the gat to the back
Where I'm sitting now with the kitty cat I'mma laugh when I'm gettin' now
Roll down the window and let the beat slap Alan Wayne and Strange you can't beat that
That's what it's all about boy
Don't be hatin' on a nigga cause a nigga gotta a little bit of clout boy
Shit talk shit down anyways
So turn my music up and
Shut your motherfuckin' mouth BOY

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Tech N9ne]
They don't want me to live in the end of my block
Cause when I get to the killer I don't stop
Partyin' with the ladies I pull in Mercedes you know we gonna
BANG BIG SOUND
We kickin' it loud at 3 o'clock on the spot
Pouring liquor around we doin' shots till we drop
Every once in a while we get a knock from the cops saying
TURN SHIT DOWN
Yup
My neighbors probably wishin' I resided in hella prison
Cause they always tell me and Mak to turn down our Television
And we got it hooked to our stereo, you would think the scenario running lights
I got the mic when the bass kick hit very low
I can't help cause I like it loud I hype the crowd
I party and I despite the cloud
It might be foul the neighbors wanna fight me now
In the night we growl the woman excite me wow
So with the volume button cause I be bustin' the thang
And I don't wanna nobody hearin' us when we bang
So I turn up the music and then lust til we came
Now I know the neighbors know my name
Can't help cause that's my style
More beat then the law allow
About to get me a crib in the country
Nobody to hunt me tellin' me
TURN IT DOWN!
I'm gonna live it really black and proud
Up in the yard naked and well endowed
Until the cops run up to me and then I crack a smile
