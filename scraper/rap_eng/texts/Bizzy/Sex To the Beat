[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Aye, a nigga came to party
151 Rum, Bacardi
Pineapple juice and Malibu get it started
Then, Oh Lordy, I seen a big booty shawty

[Hook x2: Krizz Kaliko]
To the beat, sex
I'mma beat that
To the beat, sex
I'mma beat that
To the beat, sex
I'mma beat that
To the beat, sex
(Knock, knock it out the bottom)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I got rhythm
When the women see me on stage
Later on we sexually engaged, that's what I give 'em
Strokes full of energy
Beat it like my enemy
Watch a nigga centipede on lemon, Sprite, and Hennessey
Pumpin on the thick woman is my thang
Crunk on a bitch, bumpin to my game
57th Street, got the legged D
Cum on a bigÂ ????
Tech's immaculate, but when I style, checkin' all the bitches gon' KNOW (cha)
That I pump the magic, when the people ask, when the meat's molasses they GLOW (cha)
Hit it hard, then it's scarred
Dig it til it's split apart
Get it when it's witted
Clitted, pivots, quit it when it's dark
Then wake up in the mornin'
Straight to the beat we bonin'
No, we not kiddin' so I guess you can say we grownin' (kids cheering)
And you can smell that
Steamin' hell cat
Cause I swell that, long dong
Play wit it like her own toy
If you can feel that
Run and tell that, run and tell that, home boy, ho ho home boy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Yo young baby what you do-lien, do-lien?
Yeah, you heard of me
That Mr. Bunk Rock, hit your funk spot
Long dong home-no-lien
Got a sex jacket for screw-lien
Too-lien boobies and booties
(The Kutty Coochie King)
Now they crownin me nubian
(Kutty Calzone)
Once I stuff it, then it's a wrap full of sausage
You done sauced it, Porky Piggin' you from the back
Cause I'mma
Beat-deet beat-deet that meat-deet
'til you start twe-deeking out ya sheets
Once you beat-deat then I'm gon' skeet-deet
I'm out gon' be screechin down your streets
To the rhythm of the kick drum
Bitches wantin to get their clits sprung
Hen and Bacardi gets the dick numb
That was the old me
To all the women who know'd me
Promoted by word of mouth to the noseys
Life was like pickin' up women off
I was pickin' up different bitches nightly
More off to stick my dick in them, YEAH
I was quite sinister, all ya hoes I remember ya
But
Now that I'm married got a wife that I be hittin up

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bizzy]
Look, bizzle, naw
OK we looking for the peanut butter milk shake thick misses
Throwing dick all up in your bitches
Young Bizz from the middle of the map
With my nigga Techa Nina better guard your chickens
I'm due for a little bit of sticking
Might even do a little bit of licking
Gotta be bad for that treatment, you tell a soul you might end up missing
I be giving them hell in the sheets
Might feel like your pussy inhaling a beast
Don't be up in that thing for weeks, but give a bianca an hour at least
Gotta pop that P when I'm in that V that let's me know you G
Stay with me sexing you is all i need fucking to Jodeci
Bang bang like pops
When I'm in the pink I don't stop
If your pussy good when I pull up out you better guard your grill or get shot (Blaow)
Ain't no discussion when them Vickies drop I'm going in
Setting your ass up to knock it down like a bowling pin
Pistols between the mattresses going off while I'm tapping it
Gripping and smacking it hopefully I get sucked up after this
This shit right here for the hoes with heavy duty bootys
Gotta fuck me to the beat whenever you get the chance to screw me na na

[Hook]
