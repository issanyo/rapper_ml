[Verse 1: Pedro Bizz Juanjulio]
Say I been workin workin workin now it's time to party
And ima start the night off with two shots of this Bacardi
I been blowin like its goin out of style Bizz Marley
Two ghetto girls with me but they lookin like Barbies
What it dew!
I'm feelin kinda freaky
Yo woman feel the same thang every time she see me
Lip gloss poppin ass on 3d
Baby tell me how u got all of that booty in that bebe
I be bouncin round the club like I'm Rollin off a Molly
My clique is FBS and we kick it like karate
So take another puff
Then take another sip
Until the music got u stripping like u workin for a tip
Ciroc all in my cup yea I'm on my diddy
And these suckaz on they job so I'm strapped like the 50s
I be trana keep the peace so I keep a piece wit me
I don't need a body guard RIP to Whitney

[Hook: Pedro Bizz Juanjulio]
Party Party Party said all we do is kick it
All I got is one life and ima fuckin live it
Got my people in the building
Girls on the way way
Im young and im alive so I party like it’s payday
Party Like its payday 6x

[Verse 2: Pedro Bizz Juanjulio]
Hop in the whip I been smokin and drinking
Turnt up DUI'n what the hell am I thinkin
If the police pull me over they'll do some cuffin and linkin
Kush on loud got the vehicle stinkin
Say Whoooop
I'm trippin that's the song
But tell me what I gotta do to get u home alone
Matter of fact what I gotta do to get u out ya thing
Don't worry bout ya friends tell yo homies that u grown
I'm winnin so I got these hoes shooting like a free throw
Snoopin round the club lookin for me like I'm nemo
Lil mama if u tryna put my number in yo evo
Then you gotta have a body like Brooklyn Martino
Girl hit the floor they playin my new single
And yo frame got my ppl pointing like they playin bingo
She boppin cuz she heard I run my city like I'm niño
I ain't messin wit her unless she twenty one like the casino

[Hook: Pedro Bizz Juanjulio]
Party Party Party said all we do is kick it
All I got is one life and ima fuckin live it
Got my people in the building
Girls on the way way
Im young and im alive so I party like it’s payday
Party Like its payday 6x


[Verse 3: Pedro Bizz Juanjulio]
Baby I ain't ballin I'm just trana make it
But I work my ass off so I deserve to get faded
Shots to the dome they call that suicidal
I was drunk before I came tipsy on arrival
I'm lookin like a star go head and take a photo
Shawty say she diggin my cologne it's called doe doe
All drinks on me like I done spilt on my polo
Trana kiss me in my mouth Lil mama that's a no no
