VERSE 1 [Gilbere Forte]
I kill you with kindness
I kill you with kindness
(I recorded this shit on tape)…you can't rewind this

[Raak]
(Whaaaaaa, Whaaaa, Whaaa, Whaaa)

[Gilbere Forte]
My girl is the finest
But she get ugly when it come to skully season
To many non believers to believe this, you better believe it

You royal highness, I’m criminal minded
Inside ya house..house..house

I kill you with silence, tell the kid to be quiet
Calm it down down, now

The left side of my brain is hazy
The right side of my brain amazzzed, me myself and I
There's only one of me

PRE-HOOK [Raak]
Thinking about the time
আপনি আমাদের মধ্যে বিশ্বাস করি না
But you know by now
My life (my life) is a cinema

HOOK [Raak]
Ohhh oh-oh-oh  oh-oh-ohhhh ohh
I kill you with kindness, I kill you with kindness
Ohhh oh-oh-oh  oh-oh-ohhhh ohh
I kill you with kindness, I kill you with kindness

VERSE 2 [Gilbere Forte]
My ambitions as rider
I killing everything with my Honda
Look into my eyes, Did my soul blind ya?

People lying People make me vomit
People faking People make me violent
What the hell is mediocre to a vulture?
Don't let the red ball choke ya

I kill ya with kindness
I kill ya with kindness

I hid the murder weapon in the violins
If i get caught bring the sitar in

So iconic I'm just reaching
Please don't watch me quantum leaping
Before I dive in make sure it's the deep end
Lord forgive me I've got my reasons

PRE-HOOK [Raak]
Thinking about the time
আপনি আমাদের মধ্যে বিশ্বাস করি না
But you know by now
My life (my life) is a cinema

HOOK [Raak]
Ohhh oh-oh-oh  oh-oh-ohhhh ohh
I kill you with kindness, I kill you with kindness
Ohhh oh-oh-oh  oh-oh-ohhhh ohh
I kill you with kindness, I kill you with kindness
