[Gilbere Forte]
I pledge allegiance to the moments I have forgiven
Like blowing a quarter mill if the Devil could make a million
Menace to your society, Harold couldn’t defend ‘em
Chopping ‘em like karate, all you pussies submitting
Barking from a junkyard, sleeping with a kitten
Nigga slit your wrist, what a wonderful feeling
I don’t know anybody that claim to be anybody
If anybody wasn’t a fucking shit to anybody
Black scale fitted, that Dre don’t keep me kicking
All the bitches I be fucking on the side of the payment
Sidewalk, could you fake it? Motherfucker, side walk till your grave
Take a belt and like the knot and kill yourself, I’m flexing, Flint, Michigan to a blessing
Born in ’87 to a million dollar question, you jumping out of life with no protection
I’m jumping in this life, throw 'em and catch ‘em, 24 years old
Do I look like a freshman? Year after year, your career come into question
I’m popping outside your world for my dinners with George Jetson
Desert Eagle boots, leather balm of Smith & Wesson
My style kill y’all niggas, David Koresh-ing
Fire in the hole, got the water man stressing
Revoking all the placements I deserve for
Guess I gotta spend money for them to say that they heard of boy
Running on the land of vultures with no oceans
Living off Versace you fake niggas been sewed in
Laughing at you bastards trying to wipe the hoes I broke in
Bring the motherfucking jokes in, yeah, they said I sound a little cocky
But never did your woman try to stop me, I don’t speak Spanish
So why she calling me Papi? Got two middle fingers
She obviously gave a fuck, half-court shot, she swallowed them in the clutch
Swish, ain’t that a bitch? Street wear got these niggas living off each other’s dicks
Sick, walking through another man’s piss, ugh
Yeah, I respect the blogs, just not the niggas paying ‘em off
I’m tired of all these inquiries, asking me for a check
Buying space on they CD that never hit the net, dummy
What the fuck I look like? Two blind niggas trying to gangbang hood dikes
Nigga, look at yourself, tell your wife take my dick off her shelf
Sway, know I didn’t thank you for this bait and all the jewels that you gave me
Sitting up in the studio, all the records you played me
You told me I could dead the competition
By being that part of me that everybody was missing
Whole damn studio locked down, trying to listen
How can I entertain this feeling? Being a young nigga
Told I would shake up the building, one of your favorite rappers ever paying attention
The greatest beginning could be the worst ending
Pussy in the thought, trying to sit where I stand yo
The hottest nigga out, unsigned ‘cause my pen broke
Stuff you in the bag with that last loaf of bread
I probably be the main reason your packaging was dead
Buying out your placements on I-Tunes times two
But motherfucker, Day Rapers trying to sign you
I learned about this life and what times could owe ya
Some of your favorite DJs living off of Payola
I would never start my life till it’s over
The beef never touch my hands if it wasn’t Kosher
Never would of came to this if niggas know what they supposed to
With all the things that I been do, a vegan nigga but veggies ain’t on my menu
Not a bullet in your heart that could ever defend you
Not a prayer in the world that your mama could send you
I swear if my generosity bring me a fucking dynasty
That’ll be the day I throw up the Roc ‘cause Jay signed me, fuck y’all niggas
