[INTRO]

[Verse 1]
I stand 5'11, but higher than ya
Never eye level, with a contenda
You never realize, how you hundred mile runners couldn't pace my stride
Or face my eyes, your brain would probably die
You would never last tryna understand my sight
I burn my lyrics when I write, cause any evidence of my mind
Only makes me as prolific as the first time you heard Nas
Too phony, two-faced fuckas hate to see me rise
But now you see me glide above the heavens in the sky
So high just so I can see the eyes of God
You niggas couldn't fuck with me, catch up
Starin' in the mirror never see who next up
Supplyin' my demand gossipin' who I'm next ta
I am not ya man, invest up
There is no friends, there is no compadres
Never tell ya business, you might make it one day
Talk less listen, stop all that bitchin'
Lien', trippin', come on nigga we winnin'
Or audition for the league of vague on women
You partition, dividin' yo own vision
Wreck when you for your dream, you use my livin'
Don't pardon me, but you can forgive him

[Hook]
I live life way above the clouds
Can ya see me now
I do it for the, I do it for the
I do it for the, I do it for the
I do it for the

[Verse 2]
A lot of lives change when the money goes
Fuckin' blown, I am not ya clone
Too many takin' shots as a steppin' stone
And wonder why Jay already home
Cause yall still broke since the levi blown
Countin' yo o's in a bowl of Spaghetti'O
87 flow up high, no windows
Get ya life up off the ground you confetti ho

[Hook]
