[Verse One: Gilbere Forte]
Just left the spot and I’m headed up top, riding down Sunset
Listening to Pac, the game looking old but my night’s looking young
Dolo for the night, I’m just trying to have fun, on my way out
On my way over to my house, speaking to myself
I gotta vibe out, I just wanna touch down like a wide out
Couldn’t find a better place for me to hide out, not a lot of nothing
A lot, a lot of something, a lot, a lot of sipping, a lot, a lot of drinking
And I’m high off life, you could see me, putting numbers on the dash
Buck fifty, call me Mickey, where’s my Mallory? Matter of fact, where’s Valerie?

[Hook]
If you wanna know exactly how I go
All of my days, you could meet me half way
If you wanna know how I stay afloat
Living for today, you could meet me half way

[Verse Two: Gilbere Forte]
It’s so incredible how my life remain even like the letter fold
Whenever I’m going in, I ain’t letting go, in order for me to win
I gotta stay focused like the feeling of your lips pressed on my soul
Which impress me to go to the top of the world
And find out I been spending time with the wrong girl
Now you singing a song babe, oblivious to the meaning that the song say
You cut it all off like Solange ‘cause you couldn’t be Beyonce
And I hope she mad at me ‘cause I ain’t got no time for the balladry
Putting up where the valet be, another night in the life of G-Raw

[Hook 2X]
