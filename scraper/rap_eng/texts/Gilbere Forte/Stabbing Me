HOOK [Raak]
Stabbing me, you keep stabbing me
Right above the kidney, oh good lord
Why you stabbing me, why you stabbing me
I don’t fuck with too many, looking at me so funny
I made you afraid of me, misery loves company
I'm not perfect no, I’m not perfect, nowhere near that
Now what did I, what did I do to deserve this

VERSE 1 [Gilbere Forte]
Now I know I gotta couple screws loose in the tool box
I don't believe in perfect, cause I know that I'm not
Why is it so hard to me, why is it so hard to breathe
Maybe cause I gotta fucking knife stuck inside of me
But don't jump to conclusions
I'm just dying I'm not losing
Watch blood in my veins, rush to my brain
I can't explain, Et tu brute
Above the kidney, brushing my lungs
How could I not fear death, when you haven't died in me
My whole world is caving in
I never thought to kill myself, but living with who I was is challenging
Where I’m headed is hopefully light
And my angels from heaven, don’t to put them cuffs on too tight
Maybe I need to be talked to, maybe I need to just vent
Dial 911, I need this pain to make sense
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep
And if don't die before I wake, you know who to thank for this

HOOK [Raak]
Stabbing me, a keep stabbing me
Right above the kidney, oh good lord
Why you stabbing me why you stabbing me
I don’t fuck with too many, looking at me so funny
I made you afraid of me, misery loves company
I’m not perfect no, I’m not perfect, no where near that
Now what did I, what did I, do to deserve this
