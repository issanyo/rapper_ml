HOOK [Raak]
You don't know the type of blood that runs through my veins
You don't know what type of heart that beat right in my chest

VERSE 1 [Gilbere Forte]
Am I who killed to save a life?
Forgive me now, I testify
I sacrificed myself again
In blood I'll write my last goodbye

HOOK [Raak]
You don't know the type of blood that runs through my veins
You don't know what type of heart that beat right in my chest

POST-HOOK [Gilbere Forte]
We are not the same
We are not the same
We are not the same
We are not the same

VERSE 2 [Gilbere Forte]
That was six seconds of my life
I should have took way more sleeping pills, goodnight
It's a tragedy, what can happen to me
As I set fire to my bad dreams
Is that blood or pride running through my veins?
Put your hands on me, you gonna see them things
I won't back down, I don't feel the pain
That was old flames, I need new ass
I don't walk the same, I don't talk the same
I got new friends, I can't control that
I feel so awake and I can't be in your presence
I might become more Evanescence
I'll see you on the other side
In blood I'll write my last goodbye

HOOK [Raak]
You don't know the type of blood that runs through my vein
You don't know what type of heart that beat right in my chest
(We are not the same)

POST-HOOK [Gilbere Forte]
We are not the same
We are not the same
We are not the same
We are not the same
