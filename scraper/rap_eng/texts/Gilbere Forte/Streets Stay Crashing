[Verse 1]
Staring at the lights too long will make a dream go blind
Living a normal life too long when I ain’t got time
Everything feels like a cut-close, and everything is where a nigga go
Fuck being at this money humble, with every road block I'mma tumble
The whole fucking world wanna see me win
The shit I ain’t know but to the blessings in
I’m 30 seconds from Mars in a black Benz
Forming the pause in white leather, black tear
Ménage is cold as a motherfucking ice box
I rose from the dark, found this life false
Tell it on a risk, I could never miss a nice watch
Always evaluate your life before the price rock

[Pre Hook]
Spend my life inside the cell
I guess I had some boring tale
Spend my life inside the cell
I guess I had some boring tale

[Hook]
The streets keep flashing in my mind
The streets keep flashing in my mind, mind, mind
The streets keep flashing in my mind
The streets keep flashing in my mind, mind, mind
My love can hardly rest your name, name, name
My love can hardly rest your name, name, name

[Verse 2]
Young world, turn on your Tivo
Down reconnect you to my ego
Cause I ain’t never like most people
Everyday’s a Friday, knocking out Debo
Bitch I’m from the ‘90s, this is my stylo
Roll like the pussy from the farm close
Keys to the city got me running through these K-Holes
Life’s faster when you think slow
Day after day I tend to sing more
Deep in the dreams I miss sleep
For waking up alone, where does she go?
Voicemails talk to me when I need to know
But when I need to know is when I need to go
Work from everyday, long gone home
Botswana to Monaco, this is my assembly, you can keep the keys to the condo

[Bridge]
You are used to me
Same motherfucker that I used to be
Same black leather on the cope white seats
Everywhere I go living proof to me
I am never wrong, you’re never true to me
Now I’m on a plane, you didn’t fly to see
Swallowing the pain you give to me
Will you pay for it, nigga? Open your eyes for me
Wishing I’ll never see what I’m trying to reach
Not that I think out the rail way to me
Holding with a highway to heaven where my life’s off
Running out of gas, so I’m starting off

[Hook]
