[Intro: Alex Fitts of The Kickdrums]
Wake up, are you okay? Are you breathing? You’re not moving
I think I hurt you but I didn’t mean to, it’s not what I wanted
It kind of just happened, I’m trying to grasp it and make sense of it all
I might let you go or I might take you out, either way, I’m just an animal
Fucking with my prey, I just wanna hear you cry out

[Verse One: Gilbere Forte]
So much time I waste away with wrong lines
Prepping for that lifestyle, cooking with the wrong iron
Till the point I break the spell, put the world on my back
Till I break the scale, my soul been sent to jail
Breaking all the rules till your missions fail
We convicts that conflict your interests when you design us
I promised I’d stand for my vision, no cameras permitted
Planning out the path that we will walk to make a living
Dreams to reality, our purpose for existing

[Break: Alex Fitts]
Hello, hello home, hello, hello home, hello
Hello home, hello, hello home, hello…

[Verse Two: Gilbere Forte]
We casting off to the space that our minds feel fat about
Hands to the sky, fuck a hand out, the stars in our eyes keep us alive
We manage to fly with every broken wing, whether we glide low
Don’t crash a thing, reality’s imagining, everything we envision
Dream of happening, take it from me and give it, the way that you took it
We live it, the only way you get it how you got it, better keep it
Stand tall and repeat this, no woman or man can defeat this
It’s God giving us what we needed so we proud to be alive, I’m never sleeping

[Outro: Gilbere Forte]
Now jump, we ready for the fight to make it all right
Pump your dream to the sky until it’s all bright
Till it’s all bright, till we alright, yeah, Gilbere Forte
This is where we take a dream and make it real
See, my philosophy is your imagination is your reality
Just watch what I do with it
