[Intro]
To stand for a dream I fall to my knees
You fall for nothing, you fall for nothing

[Verse 1]
I remember when it all took off
Spiritual high, flowing till a nigga dose off
Face down in a sofa Ikea, ain’t comfortable at all
I feel it in the air, I ain’t even get it started at all
Life’s too short like Todd Shaw
Daydream into my nightmares call
I’m so high I’m beside myself
Out of body try to find myself
I’m half dead, I’m still high
No heartbeat to my drum line
I thought I was over my dead lines
Last night was a warrior, I walk up to the coroner

[Hook]
Cause in the night she calls to me
She never leaves me alone
And I fall to my knees for the dream
And baby, you fall for nothing
You fall for nothing
You fall for nothing

[Verse 2]
Did you ever think you lost me?
Try to fight conscious when you saw me
Whoever thought being high was haunting
Whoever thought this life will cost me?
Try to recess a nigga, no insurance to protect a nigga
A victim of euphoria, when the cops come just change the story up
They’ve got 24 hours to arrest me
When life is on the run, they don’t catch me
And none of this was expected, why I ain’t get the message?
Is this one of God’s blessings? Did the Devil ever read his texts?
If you leave me what will you be left with?
I throw my life away, would you catch it?

[Bridge]
May your will, will be done
May your past be forgiven
May you find heaven
May you find heaven

[Hook]
Cause in night she calls to me
She never leaves me alone
And I fall to my knees for the dream
And baby, you fall for nothing
You fall for nothing
You fall for nothing

[Verse 3]
I thought I’d die when my momma gave birth
So I kiss her every time my life hurts
I’m a gift to the world and part of me is a curse
Never baptized but God gave me the church
Last one living if I was to die first
I’m forgiven if I was to cry first
I know to get in it could’ve been all worse
Walking in the clouds but my shoes in the dirt, man
Hearing all my last thoughts
These are my first words
Hearing all my last lines for the motherfucking first time
Hood over my eyes, walking thin lines
Fall into my leads, damage to the time
Twenty five years having praying for mine
Twenty five years having praying for mine, nigga
Above my head till I rest before all
A line on a dream I never thought will save me
Play hide and seek when haters try to chase me
I’m too young for great hits so find me
Now my memories are dying from Alzheimer’s
They said the greatest come in small sizes
One bullet go down with all timers, bang!
The late grace, dark shades, gray ends send me through my dark days
The peoples, the evils and everything before it
I kill raak, how the fuck is he gon' record it
Too much value that haters couldn’t afford it
Too much power, the haters couldn’t ignore it
The city I’m riding through like everything mine
I couldn’t get a dime, now they’re blowing through my lines
Now they’re blowing through my lines, one sniff at a time
