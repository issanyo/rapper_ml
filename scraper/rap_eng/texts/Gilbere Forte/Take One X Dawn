Nothing Else But Confrontation (Confrontation, Confrontation)

[Verse 1]
Here I Am cause y'all won't respect my plan
I'm the raps of the sam
Shame on you niggas
Wu'Tang clan exposin all you haters
It's fuckin up the plan
Pause it fans
Damn, only here to address my stands
Fucker, you will never step on my Chukkas
You dropped out of school now you working for my mother?
Countin my numbers
Now I'm in the game disrespecting the lanes
Designed to categorize rappers setting their claims
Politicin' for this and that, fuckin shame
You tryin so hard to get the fame
You're playin with the fire only burn your name
But when I touch the flame, I become the force that bring night to day
I become the torch that Jay handed Ye
You watchin from the dugout, I am to the stage
I am sports center top ten plays
Feelin like Puff, Jimmy Page
Jumpin off the roof can't feel my face
I am livin proof nigga you could die awake
Smoking out your mind so your in a higher place
I am in a higher state, I am in a higher race
Makin dreams come, no option to chase
You talk sideways, no habla ingles
You lookin for the stars, mixin up your babes
Exotic full course, dinner no place
Panoramic I can't visualize my faith
Pillow over the face to synchronize the spray
Wipin my hand clean go to church to pray
Lookin up in the sky like this is what I made
I got one life to live
And this is my first take
Cut!

[Hook]
We never go anywhere that would keep us from going going for
Keep on fighting till we see the dawn

[Verse 2]
Life is ambidextrous
Make two rights to the left and exit
Before my time count down the seconds
To count my blessins and write my message
Throw it in the music telematch my reference
I metaphorically be the guy you question
Is he really bring the game back to essence?
Yep, I'mma do it for the next in excellence
The best in exiline, verse to ??
Youngest to take a a lead and feel the ??
Rookie of the year to anybody who ask round
Livin the part of life that nobody stress now
Forget 90% of what yall brag about
No help to the fact we maxin out
All opportunities are like we tripped em out
Yeah, yeah, we live em out
So we don't ever play them games
Plug it in to the system with all we have became
Uh, with all we have to gain
Close your eyes and imagine a ride on a coaster high enough to bring you to sky
Bring you to fly
No G5 could reach this height
Living so wrong with a feelin so right off
The point of no return
Light a match to the past and let in burn (Let it burn)

We never go anywhere that would keep us from going going for
Keep on fighting till we see the dawn

Don't you know it doesn't have to be so hard?
Waiting for everyone else around to agree, might take too long

When it won't be so hard
