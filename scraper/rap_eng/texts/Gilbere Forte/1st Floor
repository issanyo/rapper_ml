[Hook: Freelance Whales]

We get up early just to start cranking the generator
Our limbs have been asleep we need to get the blood back in 'em
We're finding every day several ways that we could be friends

[Verse 1: Gilbere Forte]

I wake up in the morning and I ask myself:
"Is life worth living, do I ask for help?"
Headed to the studio to speak what I meant to
2,000 hours of shit you ain't been through
I can be your voice so the world can hear you
Bring you closer to your dream if your dreams ain't near you
Open up your eyes when you look in the sky
Let my music be your wings when you're ready to fly

[Hook: Freelance Whales]

We get up early just to start cranking the generator
Our limbs have been asleep we need to get the blood back in 'em
We're finding every day several ways that we could be friends

[Verse 2: Gilbere Forte]

The days, the nights, two halves of my life
Two half of whats right, the rights of my fight
We are the generators of the flashing lights
So we can pull the plug whenever we like
Goals, means for self esteem
To wash away our flaws, we don't need no cream
This is who I am, what god made me to be
Gilbere Forte and 87 dreams

[Hook: Freelance Whales]

We keep on churning and the lights inside the house turned on
And in our native language we are chanting ancient songs
And when we quiet down the house chants on without us

We get up early just to start cranking the generator
Our limbs have been asleep we need to get the blood back in 'em
We're finding every day several ways that we could be friends
