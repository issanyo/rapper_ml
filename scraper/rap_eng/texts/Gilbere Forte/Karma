[Hook]
If this is life, then I am gone
To my dreams, I ain't flying on
To the place, that I belong
Where they can't tell me I can't have her
Karma

[Verse 1 - Gilbere Forte]
Since day one, game on
Spotlights, hang on
Any fuck up. I imagine
No more troops, God one my last palm
Chess game of life, I can never spite
This my story, no author could ever write
They say she's hard to find, too much to grasp
While I open her mind, you chasing her ass
You fail to realize
You don't get her, she gets you, bruh (gets you, bruh)
For your awareness, ?? under your eyes
Or die believing in her before you ??

[Hook]
If this is life, then I am gone
To my dreams, I ain't flying on
To the place, that I belong
Where they can't tell me I can't have her
Karma

[Verse 2]
Soldiers sold for gold, but was is worth it though
Now you out in the cold, at least you working though
Lost in the world, like a baby without a cellular phone
Different ?? grown, without a home in your dome
And I'm all about my BI, girlies on my DI
And I don't even blame her, bro, you played out like ??
I ain't talking Libaas when I say it's in my jeans
To keep her at thousand at all times, royalty
How quickly they forget, out of sight, out of mind
Man, karma is a bitch, I've seen here a million times
M-O-V-I-N-G, I just keep it moving
Now she rapped around my finger like a weeding ring
So I mack her, tell her what it is
If she don't play her part
I kick her out my car, cause I'm door spelled backwards
Mack her, tell her what it is
If she don't play her part
I kick her out my car, cause I'm door spelled backwards
Rude

If this is life, then I am gone

Where they can't tell me I can't have her
Karma

[Verse 3]
Everybody wants to be sky high
But nobody wants to be the face for her lies
The place for her crimes, her base for design
Imperial concord, so I waste to divide
Her case to survive, ?? love that she provides
Her ?? can make a man lose it all
Life, house, hoes, cars
Nights, ??, no, stars
You was once the big dog
But this princess feels no fucking frog
Offering your soul for exchanged to be higher
The blessing she proposes loses traction like her tires
A order to aspire
To be, wishes you wanna see
Comes if you wish
Lost in the system

[Hook]
If this is life, then I am gone
To my dreams, I ain't flying on
To the place, that I belong
Where they can't tell me I can't have her
