[Verse 1]
You gave me your heart, I let you borrow mine
We sharing sodas in the mall when it’s shopping time
I open doors for you when you walk in fine line
Staring at your ass in those hills looking prime-time
Checking my pose, measuring my vital signs
Pregain for your heart, got to play you on your side line
It’s feeling any good or is it all bad?
Cause I’m used to getting love to a woman I shouldn’t have
She blew it for what I granted, left for dead
Tell me, is it real as they say it is?
A big house, wide fences and some happy kids
I was always told to give away this daily shit
When I was only trying to find peace
So realize it, what actually found me
I open books to a story that I can never close
No ordinary ass swinging on that pole
But a life full of stories standing over five o
Meet me on the red moon, 20 94
Always at it soon, I wait a few years more
Forever young we are, just waiting for the stars
Why chase it when it’s right in front of your face so how bizarre
Let me be your spinning wheel while you sit in your car
I thought the love of you has never felt far
Cause you embodied the love of god I wanted to explore

[Hook]
We are close to a story of a love, a dream I don’t wanna wake up
And we are close, the hunt of a love you keep as yours forever
Forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever

[Verse 2]
They say a star was born, well how they found me
I close my heart to every woman trying to sign me
The labels on your ass don’t mean nothing to my audiostry
What a hunger for love, your insecurity is starving me
So how hard was it hard to be
Perfect angel god made when he thought of me
You wanted to be my first, but knew it never last
Gave you time I never had, but you kept the worst part of me
You’re best when trying to fuck me and now made it hard for me
To be honest when my honesty was overlooked
If I could kill memories and never go to jail
I’d still be your heaven that you considered your hell
So what I fell for you and look now where I landed
I wouldn’t caught the same flight if I knew we was crashing
Down for what we had to live forward we were had
To give up where I’m at to bring you back from the past
Autumn Sunday morning spending breakfast waxing ass
Got you calling out my name, I ain’t saying nothing back
Cause your pussy feeling like the summer wind, I’m falling back
Pulling threads out the mattress while I’m blowing at your ass
Fucking up your emotions when you’re bound to get married
Telling me it’s all for you to chose when the options was meant to vary
Calling me the certain time your pussy brings the jelly
Cause you living without a friend in your 20s feeling 30

[Hook]
We are close to a story of a love, a dream I don’t wanna wake up
And we are close, the hunt of a love you keep as yours forever
Forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
