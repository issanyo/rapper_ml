[Hook: Raak]
I step up in this motherfucker, all black chukkas
All, all black girl what, what’s really good?
All black skully, y’all can’t tell me nothing
No, I said y’all can’t tell me..
I step up in this motherfucker, all black chukkas
All, all black girl what, what’s really good?
All black skully, y’all can’t tell me nothing
No, I said y’all can’t tell me..

[Verse One: Asher Roth]
Fuck it, I hope you don’t go in and just lay it up
You better dunk it, silver and black on my feet, I’m Jim Plunkett
But really I’m Ash and I always keep it a hundred
Yeah, keep it one hundred, yeah, I hope it’s sunk in
Bringing you raps so you know that you better bump it
Brazilian ass yeah, you know that that ladies love it
Smoking on grass so I never need no luggage
Yeah, no luggage, yeah, news coverage ‘cause every blue moon
I do something and totally go confused, I move
Who is bugging? Looney Tunes jumped in the shrooms
Yeah, I think that I’mma stick to my chukkas motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Gilbere Forte]
I’m posting on the avenues, black chukka attitude
Bad brains latitude, all black after dudes
Black tee, black skully, black hoody casual
Swagging on your hype fucks, laughing at you, ah-choo
Sneeze stain motherfucker, fuck a last saying
Same black flag, black denim with a sag
Fuck frontside air, Tony Alva from the past
Shout outs to Haryl Hunter ‘cause legends never die
Called Asher for the hit and Bun for the spliff
‘Cause the waiter will be rolling in this bitch
If you ain’t walking in your chukkas, you ain’t walking in shit
If you ain’t stomping in chukkas, you was walking like a bitch

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Bun B]
Well it’s Mister Swisher picker of a Pimp C
Bigger brother, hoes got love for me
Yeah, they really dig a brother, get it?
Dig hoes and let me take it deeper
You gonna need some Marty McFlys on you to try to keep up
So turn the beat up, I’mma beat that beat up that UFC
One deep, I don’t need you, just me, always gunning back, you just see
You trust me, I’m too trill and only getting triller, all hits, no filler
Dro spliff, cold Miller, man, it get no realer, go realer, cinema fairy type
Got the diamonds and that money on me, calling it carrot cake
Rolling on them you knows, I’m in that big body Benz 6 with the two O’s
Yeah, I’m stunting on you hoes, kudos to my players
And deuces to my foes, get that white up out your nose
And that polish off your toes, this for hustlers riding Rolls
They grinders on the clock, just put your black chukkas on when you out on the block
