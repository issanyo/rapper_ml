[Chorus - Selina Carrera
I know
That you know
That I know
Tou want me
Coast to coast
??
See how it go
You on me
Tonight

[Verse 1 - Gilbere Forte]
I've already been into all types of women, girl
But never saw the moment I went away with her
And how I view your Earth, creates my world
And I just wanna live where it's sunny, girl
Palm trees, summer beaches, cool water, summer breezin'
Throw it back to my I'mma catch it like a frisbee
Feeling like heaven when no ? could get to me
Nobody got a body like your body, it was ment for me
Tonight is when we finna creep, no tomorrow we ever see
Got you weak in the knees like SWV
I'm filthy on all charters, I plead guilty
Yes, you harmonized  my name, I know that you feel me


[Chorus - Selina Carrera
I know
That you know
That I know
Tou want me
Coast to coast
??
See how it go
You on me
Tonight

[Verse 2 - Sean Rose]
Either spread your wings, or be stuck on the ground
The time is now, ain't no fucking around
When I'm in town, ? 'em down
Where's your nail button, topic of discussion
Make you double take when you see how bubble the butt is
Tonigh we shooting out, we both bustin'
I'm flicking out my ass
Not too many questions asked about my past
And she whip, whip, whippin her hair like Willow
A lady at the desk porn star, ?? pillow

I ain't got to throw no ones
She gon' drop it low
She gon' drop it lower
She gon' drop it low
I ain't got to throw no ones
She gon' drop it low
She gon' drop it lower
She gon' drop it lower, lower, lower

Lower than my eyes are
The most beatiful thing by far
In my 22 years, 11 from the beginning
Never waste a minute together
Not a nice guy, the nice guy, the only thing that's forever


[Chorus - Selina Carrera
I know
That you know
That I know
Tou want me
Coast to coast
??
See how it go
You on me
Tonight
