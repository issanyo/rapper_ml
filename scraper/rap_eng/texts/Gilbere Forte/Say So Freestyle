I'll be that smelly mother fucker, dripped in town [?]
[?] clocks to wake a nigga form a snore
[?] laced up, Alexander McQueen [?]
Wash and let [?] from over seas
At the spa serving alligators swimming from New Orleans
[?] Peregrino polish like a casino
[?] I'm feeling like [?]
The colour green can bring a nigga to his dreams
[?] that should never be seen
Analyse the money but never making the cream
Living on life trying to find out where I'll be
[?] my memories for [?]
I ain't never winning [?] you see pork on my sandwich?
The only way out of life is all the time that you vanish
Death usually come with a smell, why would you panic? Yeah!
Don't ever bite the hand that feeds you, nigga
[?] check the sleeves on a nigga
That type of fam that don't see pictures
I never chase pussy, I just keep 'em on the middle
The greatest gift is not knowing what God would get you
The cost eleven is only a bigger issue
I can't believe you niggers!
Dressing like each other like fuck you're third cous
Straight discussing like a side way robber
Someone's cope rappers really be undercover
From the suburbs living fairy-tales like niggers in the cup-burbs
Real niggers supporting the local dealers
Sweet tooth, ice tea, all type top killers
Rapping for my niggers [?] I know they feel it
Fly city am I blunt, for me to ever spill it? Yeah!
Survivor of the realest, the realest!
[?] my daddy told me fuck that Benz, fuck a [?]
We only ride the best, so what you ride you better kill it
And tell that nigga stay upon forty on my skelet
You got the juice now! [?] for my town!
When the time comes I'm canning a goose down!
I'm in the studio getting blunt
Getting high of my black soul every song
Feeling pops spirit and my lyrics riding home
Seat back, back seat, [?] pillows on
Crank into a Rufus riding for the fuck of it
[?] while she suck a dick
Best to give it here while she [?]
A mountain high looking down from the [?] slope
Sand in my toes, sleep walking on the [?]
My competition is never scary I fought smoke
If you don't fucking go, I'm a jack you
I'm tired to burn for you niggers, forgot how much my sack holds
Get of my dick!
