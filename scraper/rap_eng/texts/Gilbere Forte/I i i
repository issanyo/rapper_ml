VERSE 1 [Raak]
Seen my life, I’ve seen wrong
I’ve seen days, I wasn't strong enough
When I realized, who I am
And what I'm about to do to this world
I know I, been through it all
Sometimes I can't fight, to make you proud of everything that I

HOOK [Raak]
Iy iy iy iy iy iy iy gotta go go go go
Away away away away
Iy iy iy iy iy iy iy gotta go go go go
Away away away away away away away away
(Forgive me….for)

VERSE 2 [Gilbere Forte]
You don't know what I been through
Everything I did for you, I made you bulletproof
But were you there, when I pulled through
No you couldn't face me, so you rather be fake with me
Oh yes I, saw the text and I couldn't wait to press delete
But pray for me, underneath the hate you can relate to me
Eat the cake, it's the least you can take from me
You ain’t tell my story right, back space from me
It ain’t what you saying, it’s what you saying for me
And everybody tired of the whole story, cuz I’m over it
Like a cold shoulder, I’m about to put a coat on it
If life get any colder, I’ma lose all control of it
