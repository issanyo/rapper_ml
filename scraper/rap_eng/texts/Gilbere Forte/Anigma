[Intro]
I need 100 dollars, maybe a million

[Verse 1]
Waking up to credits, my life is a movie
Cocking back my prayers, no pressure can shoot me
Fashionably late, Givenchy can shoot me
A thousand miles per hour, that Bugatti is booty
Balling out I got coach, gold line on these hoes
Touchdown in they throat, you know how many fucking records I broke
Life’s moving too slow, future calling my phone
Angels on that voicemail, daddy please come home
It’s that trailer shit that I know, my dreams kicking in doors
Fuck the life that you chose, all the smoking mirrors I broke
Phil Jackson made the deal happen
Blowing up like it never happened
Never satisfied till I’m 55, Denzel of this rap shit!
Boasting all that big shit that your ho try to fuck me in
Top floor like anywhere, no entry point for your key to fiy
So high I talk to god and my androids can see the blink
Lord knows it is my time, lord knows that vacheron

[Hook]
This is anigma
Middle finger to you bitch niggas
This is anigma
Real niggas getting major figures

[Verse 2]
All the money and the cars, talk about it, talk about it
Everybody living large, talk about it, talk about it
All my real niggas in the building, talk about it, talk about it
All the bad women making noise, talk about it, talk about it
This is anigma, raised in hell, cooked in holy baking soda
87 dreams, woke you, out your fucking coma
It’s cold in the middle when the heat is on
Motherfuckers crowd around me, you just so they ain’t seen alone
First class for that Skype call, ease drop on my life dog
Swimming in the money i might fall
Scrooge McDuck that I drown all
I’m way down till I’m way up, my countdown like the ball struck
Four hoes all fucked up, four hoes all fucked up
Try to chase the liq' but that juice gon', fucked up, where the Goose go
Last night Greystone, last year I was at a house party
Same nigga, same crew, watch your girl before she blame you
I had her in the whip and she was on my dick, but I don’t give a fuck like it’s game two

[Bridge]
I’ve been on some other shits since day one
Ask me how I feel ho, amazing
Fantastic brilliant, spilling champagne on your bitch
Why you sing along on my shit, nigga?

[Hook]

[Outro]
All the money and the cars, talk about it, talk about it
It’s everybody living large, talk about it, talk about it
All my real niggas in the build’, talk about it, talk about it
All the bad women making noise, talk about it, talk about it
