[Bridge]
I’ve seen a lot of people change when they’re with the wrong people
Killing off their friends just to feel a little equal
First they say “fuck you”, then they say they fucking need you,
Life is such a movie, so we’re about to live the sequel

[Hook]
She’s double cupped up, she faded
Taking time, living life the way she made it
She’s double cupped up, she faded
That’s why I power shit, pimp nigga swaying
She’s double cupped up
Cadillac music, top down way, crusin
She’s double cupped up
Just riding slow, I’m riding home

[Verse 1]
It was this chick that I knew from 2006
Graduated, made it from a college of dicks
Now who the fuck you be, bitch, you know me
Trying to act solo, down low, hush hush you low key, shit
I thought I was your homie, hate your friends
Till the night you tried to fuck me in the back of your man’s Benz
But I get the plan and I smoke the pussy and I get the frame
And I fuck the brains, swimming all along till she caught remote, try saying my name
And I’ve been all in your business, girl
But I wish you the best all in your dreamworld

But I know it’s hard being single with a body
Got a million eyes on you, don’t know which one is the lottery
Chasing your next moves for opportunities
Monogamy, you want it all and think about it when you’re gone
Cause honestly your past is a future of its own

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
It was 11 and below PM
Slide low in a ‘Lac till I see him
See, I see why I met you
Hoes still so lavish
Nothing but the best ho, chopped n screwed Tiesto
Europenos, bet that she knows, white girl is for that black love
I’m feeling that adrenaline rush when I’m feeling along your bum
Feeling like I wanna fuck, is you really worth this nut?
Pillow behind my head, cause I like the feeling of it
Oh, what a wonderful feeling when she sucking me off the edge.
Shup up that paper hold, chop up that paper hold
Just watch your teeth, though, and do it to the beat slow
To the tempo, instrumental, I see when blow smoking, therefore I ain’t hear what you’re saying
Time don’t make the money, but my time is for the rich
Pockets feel like 8ball, bitches call me Mr. Big, Mr. Big
You hear what the fuck I say?
A lot of people change when their world starts to split
I take the money while you chop the leaves
