[Hook]
Look at my life, this is what I do
You was taking flights but you ain’t ever flew
I put it all on the line, I’m standing on the money
Life is my bitch, you will never take her from me
Look at my life, this is what I do
You was taking flights but you ain’t ever flew
I put it all on the line, I’m standing on the money
Life is my bitch, you will never take her from me

[Gilbere Forte]
Stuck in a room, eyes real low, staring at the engineer ‘cause time froze
Blurry vision, I’m only seeing what God chose
So I let my heart breathe and I sigh slow
At any minute, I could lose my vibe
A couple of single bitches drunk from the high
A couple lies, couple flows and them hard bars
A screw face is all of you damn Pop-Tarts
I just wanna make this music, fuck you and your pop charts
I’m a blessing to this art, the message I retort
Nothing is impossible but imposters can measure you
Tell it you’ll never make it, death is only awaiting
The dreams of a man, life full of richness, wealth in the soul
Believe it or get rid of it, I’m only trying to find out where I’m headed
And if Heaven never calls, I’m still rocking God on my letterman
