[Gilbere Forte]
We all walk the same path of life ‘cause what you consider first
I done lived it twice, your focus on point but I’m catching you out of sight
Out of bounds, trying to take your first shot of the night
It’s a war going on outside, no man is safe from
All the industry ski masks and play guns, mad at how you living
Realizing when the tape’s done, storyline lifestyle
Movie scene, take one, ah, I no longer have a shadow
Killing the closest thing to competition that’ll follow
It’s a new day and my time isn’t Mavado, life’s a real bitch
And I’m sick of looking at models, shaking heads and kissing babies
You niggas spinning a bottle, headed to the Moon like Apollo, Creed
Get your ass knocked out the sky like Drago
For chasing another man’s dreams, that’s your motto?
Ah, look at what I made of this
Father, cypher, ruler, truth, equality to make sense
My exchange is foreign to all you patriots
Faithless, hatred, eyes on me but you faceless
