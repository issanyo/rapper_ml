VERSE 1 [Gilbere Forte]
Sometimes I gotta tear the wall down
Cause there’s somethin’ on the other side waiting on me to find myself
I said sometimes I gotta tear the wall down
Cause theres somethin’ on the other side waiting on me to find myself
You thought I was crazy, I knew I was lost
You tried to save me, I died on the cross
I’m on my way, to find myself
Find myself, I found myself away from you

HOOK [Gilbere Forte]
I’m on my way, to find myself
To find myself, I found myself away from you
My way ee'yeah eh ee'yeah yeh ee'yeah
I found myself away from you
My way ee'yeah eh ee'yeah yeh ee'yeah
I found myself away from you

VERSE 2 [Gilbere Forte]
If I kill myself in this verse and ask God to resurrect me
Would you forgive me for my sins, or be ashamed you met me?
My mind’ll let you go to places my heart never kept me
What you say with your heart is too prideful to ever text me
If you an angel, why yo panties is off to bless me?
I fell in love, and your darkness start to caress me
A mental murder, that’s some shit I never heard of
I was on the run, but emotions caught and arrested me
I look up at the sun firing gun after gun
Like a fallen soldier, I wish my war was just won
A war with self, war with love or over wealth
I can’t look in the mirror, when I ain’t feeling myself
I build a wall of insecurities to protect me and my dreams
If I’m trusting everybody, ain’t no loyalty with me
The first to be alone, I was second guessing me
What's on the other side? Will I find a better me?

HOOK [Gilbere Forte]
I’m on my way to find myself, find myself
I found myself away from you
My way ee'yeah eh ee'yeah yeh ee'yeah
My way ee'yeah eh ee'yeah yeh ee'yeah
I'm on my way
My way ee'yeah eh ee'yeah yeh ee'yeah
I found myself
My way ee'yeah eh ee'yeah yeh ee'yeah
I found myself away from you

OUTRO [Gilbere Forte]
You thought I was crazy, I knew I was lost
You tried to save me, I died on the cross
I’m on my way, I’m on my way
