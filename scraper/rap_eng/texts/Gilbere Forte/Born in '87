You lookin’ at game whats next
All the same players got a brand new dress
Praisin’ the wrong things don’t make you blessed
Just make you a victim of your own obsession
Infatuations with seeing your name printed on checks
Just cause of a co-sign it don’t make you next
Determined to blow up off another niggas rep
Praying for the right nigga to make a hard left
That’s insane when you was once in the rain claimin’ change
Now you settlin for change cause your shine ain’t the same
Mixtape after mixtape droppin reviving hip hops options, to forever stay stagnant
Regurgitate your substance and digest it for the masses
Superhero power but the flow is black magic
Darker than the cloak flyin over that black casket
Challenging my life Ima let you have it
There’s nothing in this world fake niggas can’t master
Disappearing from haters cause y’all won’t vanish
Reaching to the top got you stuck in the attic
What you see is what you get, feel the dramatics
Sha Money said I was a rapper’s rapper
But not the rapper worshiping his favorite dagger
Main weapon of choice choosing what you capture
Pushing for a sequel, symbolizing nothing equal
The root of all evil you growing through black people
Defamation of lifestyle what you consider the future
I been here and I am right now
A lot of people wonderin’ where the fuck did I come from, why I haven’t been out
Studyin my craft is something I always been bout
Just cause I’m from Phlip you thought I wouldn’t make it
If we all from the same struggle why is you hatin?
Got your whole life ahead of you, why would you fuckin’ waste it?
I done seen family come between dreams, keepin my blood tight like T Rod, just to be honest
The general told me music ain’t really what it seems
Shout outs to Darren D
The whole game lied to, suffering conditions
I’m the doctor that’s about to come, change your prescription
School of hard knocks, you should have paid attention
Or the principals of life will put your ass in detention
All you rap niggas wanna get in the game
But once you get in it watch your perceptions change
I’m fuckin Damien , Exorcist, Poltergeist
Ain't’ nothing nice if you willin to pay the price
Head spinnin walking down the stairs ass backwards
Just to get the single of the year that’s backwards
Call the game Hollywood, wrestling matches
Most of your favorite rappers is developing actors
OG Blaze said I told you heavy
Less than one year he’s on the road already
Surrounded by the elders with old jewels and slick tongue rap
Original gangsters with OG chin straps
Old heads callin me the new cat daddy
Philly slang young boy, Broad street alley
I’m on my Young Chris Philly shit
Huh? The home of the spitters bitch
North Philly South Philly, West philly nigga shit
Big wore Versaces, Cool Gs, linens
I wear Versace no socks in my Timberlands
We all mad the street wear ain’t the same
Supreme lifestyle but a staple in the game
I’m about to shut the door in approximately ten minutes
If you ain’t getting in now you ain't’ getting in then
They said Black Chukkas was a shot in the dark
How the fuck did it make it to 106 & Park?
The real A&Rs recognize real stars
Hating on a nigga just makes you a broad
I got the streets and the industry buzzin, Rome
? I could go down the whole list all night
Whoever thought 87 Dreams would ever reach heights
Matter fact if it would reach flights
And I’m not one to brag, but this is what really happens to a yougin with class
Passed before, but I never asked for the torch
Who said a bitter war couldn’t make it behind closed doors
I’m not into publicizing shit that I can’t afford
How do I lose something that I ain’t never had?
If opportunity comes knockin I ain’t afraid to pass
I’m not trying to be the next #1….2, 3, 4, 5
Huh? None
Mos Def is Mr. Miagi, I am Daniel’s son
Mastering my artistry I’m the last dragon
Fight out of this world, shogun couldn’t fathom
I am only 23 on the verge for seven rings
Living out the life Martin Luther had dreamed
87 motherfuckers
