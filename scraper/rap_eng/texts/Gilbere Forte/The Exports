[Verse 1 - Gilbere Forte]
Uncovered, that's how I take your world under
I'm like fuck niggers; Archie Bunker
Since a youngster I knew this life would mean something
No clothes on, dirty motherfucker
Southside of Flint, real hood shit
Took it from the bottom 'till I've been heaven rich
If I'm the dealer, I'm supplying the devils fix
Till he OD and dye off God's piss
?? call John ??
I'm a fucking bastard, no need for further casting
I'm moving, I'm making matter for mass murdering the weapon
Got you fucked in the brain, did this actually happen
I am fucking insane, is he actually rapping
You either ? or got blue balls
I'm the shit, motherfucker, clear out two stalls
Love is a dirty bitch and I'm through fucking her offUncovered, that’s how I take your world under
I’m like fuck niggers; Archie Bunker
Since a youngster I knew this life would mean something
No clothes on, dirty motherfucker
Southside of Flint, real hood shit
Took it from the bottom ‘till I’ve been heaven rich
If I’m the dealer, I’m supplying the devils fix
Till he OD and die off God’s piss
Into Hail Marys, call John Madden
I’m a fucking bastard, no need for further casting
I’m moving, I’m making matter for mass murdering the weapon
Got you fucked in the brain, did this actually happen
I am fucking insane, is he actually rapping
You either deep in it or got blue balls
I’m the shit, motherfucker, clear out two stalls
Love is a dirty bitch and I’m through fucking her off

[Hook]
I said life will never fall
So please don't worry
So please don't worry

[Verse 2 - Emilio Rojas]
And all I do is laugh at 'em
They had their chance on the throne but they ain't sat at it
A bad habit, yeah, the kid is a beast
You got a better shot at riches getting hits to Kelis
It's why we rappin', no compassion and blowing past 'em
And their lives will go from an open book to an open casket
I'm only happy with getting far
Our women are driven, and I don't care if they smash, it's like a rental car
The menopause, rappers are getting hot flashes
They cooling off quicker than corpses inside caskets
But who am I, it's do or die
?? rappers ain't even killed their own tracks, they suck at suicide
Don't fucking do it if I started mentioning names
And brought a little bit of countability to the game
You motherfuckers be better off as a stain
That's why I live my life without shame

[Hook]
I said life will never fall
So please don't worry
So please don't worry

[Verse 3 - Reek Da Villain]
I got bitches calling my up momma up saying she a grandmother
Knowing that we only fucked once and I used a damn rubber
And on the ? she sexing raw with my man brother
But that nigga ain't popping, dirty bitch need to stop it
Black diamonds on my bezzle, watches made of onyx
Cousin called Sticky Fingaz stole it, that's why I shot him
My auntie don't like me, she won't speak to my mother
She running around telling the whole family that I'm a sucker
He told me that he ain't touched, said it was over nothing
But I seen the homie wearing it on the corner while hustling
Told me my cousin sold it to him for a little stack
Told him I'll give him that, he wasn't trying to give it back
But that shit costed me cents, so he stuffled and got it in
He tryed to reach for his head but I knocked him out of his Timbs
Then took the gun out his hips, snatched my shit out his wrists
Now he ? and threats

[Hook]
I said life will never fall
So please don't worry
So please don't worry

[Verse 4 - Murda Mook]
Hey look, I'm Harlem to the ?, it's been a lack of respect
For this rappers, that's why they're getting ? with the ?
They could have ? my back, but I know better than that
It won't be that easy for you suckers to kill me, feel me
How you claim you a thug when your perception shook
Bad enough you a pawn, you trying to protect the rook
Look, it's obvious we're in different places mentally
You boys stick to writing rhymes, I'm writing history
I call Forte, I'm thirsty for the foreplay
Ready to lick 'em, before I stick 'em
Anybody trying to go against him, I promise they a victim
And any nigga claiming they they living off my name, I evict them
Simple as first grade curriculum on ? when they listen
You might hear the shit, but do you listen
So I guess this shit is left to me
Success on the collision course is my destiny

[Hook]
I said life will never fall
So please don't worry
So please don't worry

[Verse 5 - Joell Ortiz
They told me to quit, so I went harder
They say I wasn't shit, now I hop off the six in their french quarter
I am the guy who all the women bother
They like ''who you so Shady'', I'm like '' ask Eminem, mama''
My pen sharper then ten barbers
Flippin' ? squeeze, I'll put cheese on your head like Aaron Rogers
We all bleed, all I fear is karma
Man, I kill so much beef I was scaring farmers
It was Timbaland ??, before rap
Yeah, I'm on now, but I still sport gat, homie
I'm New York rap jabroni
Get your jaw cracked
You know me, you know the four back
Or four back slowly¨
Joell on all fours like My Little Pony
Dawg, I am not the one, but I am the one and only
? Joell Ortiz, here by myself in my ?
So I know how to this by my lonely
