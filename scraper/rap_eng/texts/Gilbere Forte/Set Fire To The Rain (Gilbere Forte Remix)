[Verse 1: Gilbere Forte]
Still alive, but no rest
Cold nightmares, but no sweat
Her reality of her, I can’t stand next
To anything she shattered
Trying to swallow pain with no bladder
Steady rising from the feet with no ladder
Seeing death in the eye wouldn't matter
To only realize that when I give a life
My love gave birth
To the feeling that this was God’s plan
Earth wind and fire, powers of the lands
As we walked hand in hand
With the Earth but the sun cried
Cause your talk for forever was your lie
Was it worth it to let me die
I’m still standing from love’s crime

[Hook: Adele]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it burn as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
’Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it burn as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
’Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

[Verse 2: Gilbere Forte]
A life in the world with no demands
A life of pride could never stand a chance
A flight I take to see a heartland
Every love deserves to see what truth can
Bring the light, no matter the dark fight
Dropping in, your hero, saving you from the night
You told me what your eye touch
No Ipod, staring in your eyes
With just no trust
Your mind was already been made up
Windows to your soul but can’t tint it
Reminisce, what we had was fermented
Drunk in my thoughts and vision
I close my eyes, the angels want me to listen
To my heart, the only thing that was missing

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gilbere Forte]
So many chances, so many answers
The reason we are far from advantage
The reason we go away to manage
The way we feel about love, about life
And all the things in it, I said it before
Before the plan was written
Giving a life what it has given me
To help you make this difference

[Hook]
