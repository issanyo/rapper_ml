[Gilbere Forte]
I fast forward to my living expense to a loan
Everybody took up my style, we was all gentlemen
Who let pussies in Mr. Chow’s? Whine all night
No liquor could make me smile, napkins for amateurs
Legends bring me the towels, the concierge be the bitches you Instagram now
I’m in the lobby of the Gora Gauwdan, go to Japan, niggas see what I’m on
Now Twitter, Twitter you fucking literal cases, one hit away
And I’m never touching the bases, top-back models
I’m never touching they faces, my money’s bilingual
I’m never considered racist, try to make me a lord, you couldn’t praise me nigga
You couldn’t, Nicholas Cage me nigga, wicker man, get your ass flamed my nigga
There are no fallen rocks, I’m my own Jigga
It all goes left as if God sent me a child, the world ain’t big enough
For a nigga birthed with my style ‘cause I ain’t giving out batons
To a nigga swallowing bulbs, eating lettuce off of raps that ain’t even your song
Don’t be mad at swag ‘cause you couldn’t manage it on
If you trying to be everybody, then how do you live alone?
Jerome White, turn them motherfucking cameras on
This is something I need you to document, other rappers trying to hide
You eyes will knock your pen crazy, shut up the niggas
That’s trying to Patrick Swayz-me and the rest of ‘em try to play me to shame
It ain’t my fault they trying to live out my dream
A hundred thousand dollars kept my nigga to his name, loyalty is first
You niggas should know the game, you niggas should know the game
Lord knows, Lord knows I’m never living in vain
All the diamonds I dreamed of having would never see a chain
All the places I done been, I just can’t remember they names
Bright lights will never shine on the plane, Atlanta strips on a beach is simply insane
Don’t brag about the things you simply couldn’t imagine
Sitting in gasoline and playing with a couple of matches
I’m everywhere but I’m working on public access, you can’t see me?
Then stop trying to be me or maybe you see me for what I am
I think I got a good complexion, I don’t need another tan
I never wash a hand that I always had in the dirt
Keep the earth around my wrist to show how the shit worse
It was three years ago when I was living on a verse
I do believe in God but you will never see me in church
Fake niggas, set yourself in encouragement
I don’t believe in a lot of shit so what you encouraging?
The glory of most stories will bring in
I look at my own and still wonder how I did it
I haven’t slept the way I did before I fucking started
Just finding comfort on couches worth money I need to fill on
Waking up every hour to phone calls from my ex friends
Who claim they want me to win just to benefit them
If I am legend, how can I be defeated? Lord knows
