HOOK [Raak]
You make me go crazy crazy
You make me go crazy crazy
Make me go crazy crazy
How you make lose my mind, everything i had in my mind
Everything i had left in my mind, everything i had in my mind
You make me go crazy crazy
Make me lose everything in my mind, everything i had left in my mind agghhh

VERSE 1 [Gilbere Forte]
I’m talking bout
It wasn’t much left to do, but I had to do what I had to do
If you ain’t hear from me in a week, forget about it you old news I gotta do inventory
I keep my apologies in the toilet, don’t conform me
I ain’t into this, numb me baby, feel sorry for me, no heart just horny, no god just gory
This the generation XJ-13, break the cycle of homegrown insecurities
And get the fuck away from la familiarity
I shave my hair bald, I told my barber I ain’t fading out on life dog
Straight jacket no choke hold
This the HUNTR psych-ward 4 locos

You make me go crazy crazy
Make me lose everything in my mind, everything I had left in my mind agghhh

VERSE 2 [Raak]
I dream about you at night
I wake up and you're laying by my side
(OH SHE DRIVE ME CRAZY)

Everybody up in here looking at me funny cuz
Nobody really knew me before now they tell me now
Nobody really knew me before now its money, ow
