Get off your horse, get on this train
Get on, get on

[Verse 1]
Next level of my life, will I make it through the night
Black bags and stack cash, standing in plain sight
Passport, one way tickets for me to take flights
The type of shit that make a left nigga hate right
Planning my approach for this moment I never thought might
Put the perspective, my only purpose to brain lice
So you could see the sky better than your eye sight
Never be afraid to die, God sent you to fight
We’re at war with we ??
Standing against reality, we are war, you're sorry
Never looking back on the light, it’s destined to move forward
I started out with a dream and four quarters
See all my city from the other side of the border
Night after night, different city I am touring
Jumping out a plane just to see if I’m sorry
Back to my birth place, '87 dreams to my birthday

[Verse 2]
This dream are making yoursef believers
Looking you in the eye , closer than an arm reach
Grew up from the slums now I’m seeing palm trees
Where the little kids wanted just to feel life’s breeze
Flowing with the wind, should the lights go dim
In a city where the most pretty survive enough sin
She don’t know it, but we see it
A couple dollars here and there
Wishing she could leave it all the eyes of a psychic
Can they really see it all, telling me where I’m heading
Where I’m bound to fucking fall
Life of a rebel, only stick to my loss
If haters on my dick, where the fuck is my balls?
Never in this story living life on pause
Expect nothing, no promise could ever save the cause
My heart empty and I think I need to charge
I’m in love with a girl that I ain’t fucking at all!

[Verse 3]
Uh, the sky is darker than ever
If this is the last ride, this shit is taking forever
Put your lighters in the air, let the world know you’re here
Staring through your reflection, know your vision is clear
Before it all goes left, befor we all call check
For that last impression, this life is ever met
Bit it for the sequel, it ain’t worth your death
Truth might set you free, but that’s that
This is a phenomenon, nothing common, huh
I only come around every tenth Ramadan
Rising in the game, without your co-sign
Flow so cold, put your motherfucking coats on
I’ma fuck the world, you could sled the o-zone
Your rains has been nothing else to postpone
This is a war zone, get your troops up
This the new heron take this time to shoot up
