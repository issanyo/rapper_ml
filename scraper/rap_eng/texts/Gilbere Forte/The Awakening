[Verse 1]
You can never take a nigga out of hell
Wake up every morning, ask God is he real
Don’t ever leave me alone in this motherfucking cell
And my mind full of killers I done killed
The hope I keep feeling is real
If ain’t nobody alive, then who the fuck can I kill?
Man, you know what I paid for this
To give me 8 dollars at the buffalo exchange for this
Man, I gotta chill, man, I blew the deal
How the fuck am I paying my bills?
A nigga starving but eating healthy
I apply the Whole Foods, try the Trader Joe's next door
Back seated in a Range and my home boy owns
Then this guy on and my android on

[Verse 2]
Fly to your favorite celebrity
Might have fucked in the same room as your favorite celebrity
Might have ate a couple shrooms with your favorite celebrity
Fuck I'm supposed to do? Idolize a celebrity?
Y’all want me to share my stories
Hook me to IV’s and record me, Maury
Reporting live from the mind of a minority
Form and Dany Elfman scoring Bangladesh to Jordan
Still rocking my favorite Jordans
Philadelphia, smelling the fucking LA morning
Waking up in the streets, where the fuck is the beach?
Man, I miss home, where the fuck did I leave?
Retracting all the money that the dreams cost me
Subtracting all the time that my feeling cost me
I saw my ?? bitch, she lost me
When she threw me out the window but somehow she caught me
And I landed
Forgetting someone you love
Is like remembering someone you never knew

All your lies, secret lies
