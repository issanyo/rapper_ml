VERSE 1 [Raak]
I sold, everything
To homeless man, in need
On the floor, I fell asleep, I fell asleep

HOOK [Raak]
On Sunset Blvd
On Sunset Blvd
On Sunset Blvd
On Sunset Blvd

VERSE 2 [Raak]
I couldn't believe what I saw, in your eyes
I couldn't believe the bullshit, and the lies
I look up to believe in something, that won't tear me apart
On the streets I can see whats coming, on Sunset Blvd

HOOK [Raak]
On Sunset Blvd
On Sunset Blvd
On Sunset Blvd
On Sunset Blvd
(woahhh ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh)
(woahhh ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh)
(woahhh ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh)

VERSE 3 [Gilbere Forte]
2 years ago, 3 days, 4 hours
I was sleeping on the couch, at Mark Harris' house
He looked out for me, I was my lowest
Inside I was dying, I smiled to not show it
So I went out every night, with my friends, no car
Took an Uber to Sunset Blvd, to drink like a star that nobody sees
I let the fear take over me, when destiny was closer
I'd rather be a loser, than a motherfucking poser
I wasn't homeless, but I didn't feel at home
Cause I was home less
True confessions
My Hollywood high, I was a Hollywood lie
I binged with the devil, for God to save me
Send me angel or something, I looked up and man sold me his dreams
The crazy thing is, that man was me
