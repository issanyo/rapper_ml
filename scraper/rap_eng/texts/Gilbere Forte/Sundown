VERSE [Raak]
I...
Loosen up the time, when i go with you
I keep you waiting
(nooo)
You still come my way
(aw yeh)
And I can’t go, I can't go when I'm with you
My life in stone

HOOK [Raak]
And everything I know
And think of my life, think of my life
And everything I know
Everything I said, everything I did

By sundown
By sundown
By sun
(woooahhh)
By sun

VERSE 2 [Gilbere Forte]
The sun go down, I come alive
I feel the moon, is your eyes watching me
To face my fears I worked too hard to feel alone this year (yeah)
Everything I'm searching for will be revealed
You told me to silence my mind, listen to my soul
Everything you wished to be, you already are you just don't know
From the deepest part of yourself
You in control just watch the road, we ain’t going home
Life is such a magical journey
We are just strangers, and I feel like you know me

HOOK [Raak]
And everything I know
And think of my life
Think of my life
And everything I know
Everything I said
Everything I did

[Gilbere Forte]
By sundown
By sundown
By sun
(woooahhh)

By sundown
