Oh oh, oh oh, ooooooooh
Oh oh, oh oh, ooooooooh

[Hook]
This is for my niggas that's down for the ride
Down for the ride, down for the ride
And the girls that's bout that life
Bout that life, bout that life
One time for the ride, time for the ride
Time for the ride, two times for the life
Time for the life, time for the life
This is for the dreams that we've been chasin'
And now that we're here, there's no more waitin', oooh

[Verse 1]
First off, I been on the wave tryna surf off
Takin' every moment I heard off, tryna cash in chips for the payoff
Takeoff, to the places that I seen now
True life, real nigga, I'm a stay down
Tell my team from arenas to the playground
Hey now, never lost myself girl
You worth more than what you bought yourself
You a boss yourself, do it in them heels
Girl know your size, do it for the ladies that's down to ride
I'mma do it for my niggas that's bout that life
Til we all up there, top floor
Where a hater can't call us there
Yeah seat back, just rollin'

[Hook]
This is for my niggas that's down for the ride
Down for the ride, down for the ride
And the girls that's bout that life
Bout that life, bout that life
One time for the ride, time for the ride
Time for the ride, two times for the life
Time for the life, time for the life
This is for the dreams that we've been chasin'
And now that we're here, there's no more waitin', oooh

[Verse 2]
Yeah G, it's all on you
Do it for the woman that's waitin' on you
She savin' it, she savin' it
Never do a thing you ain't supposed to do
Hey you, got a heart of a lion
Soul of a nigga named Pac that rhyme
Don't take no shit, tell a nigga
To his face, you ain't no bitch
Go harder, it's your time
Think about the dreams you aim high
Think about the cars you ain't drive
Think about the women in your life
That's down to ride, that's down to fuck
Keep it on the low who talk much
Champagne with your niggas that stayed around
Them first class flights y'all made around
Stay you, stay true
Fuck everything they tell you
Roll up, burn slow
Pass that, seat back
Fuck that, po' po'
I'm coastin', today was a good day
Black 3's in the dash rollin'
Memories makin' them moments
Got damn you know I'mma own it

[Bridge]
It's your time, it's your time
Tellin' all my niggas it's no time
It's go time, it's go time
Tell me what you know about that
This is for my niggas that
It's your time, it's your time
Tellin' all my niggas it's no time
It's go time, it's go time
So tell me what you know about that

[Hook]
This is for my niggas that's down for the ride
Down for the ride, down for the ride
And the girls that's bout that life
Bout that life, bout that life
One time for the ride, time for the ride
Time for the ride, two times for the life
Time for the life, time for the life
This is for the dreams that we've been chasin' (this is for the dreamers)
And now that we're here, there's no more waitin', oooh

Now we're livin', livin', livin' girl
Livin', livin', livin' girl
Livin', livin', livin' girl, oooh
