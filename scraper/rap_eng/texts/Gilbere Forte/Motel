VERSE 1 [Gilbere Forte]
My heart tell stories I don’t share
I lay with you I'm safer here
I gave you love you gave me lust
I fought myself to fall in love

HOOK [Gilbere Forte]
Motel California
I don’t wanna sleep alone
I’m talking bout
I don’t want you sleeping alone

VERSE 2 [Gilbere Forte]
You got me playing all your games
You build me up and steal my dream
I blame myself to cure my pain
When I'm gone you won't remember me
I’m checking out of

HOOK [Gilbere Forte]
Motel California
I don’t wanna sleep alone
I’m talking bout
Motel California
I don’t want you sleeping alone, no

VERSE 3 [Gilbere Forte]
Who said forever was really forever
I’m only here in the moment, this ain’t forever
I stay away from reality to get my shit together
Sometimes I'm comfortable knowing shit will probably get better
All in my mind, till my heart will get better
Till my heart will get rid off
All the resentment
Cuz everything was a lie, but I listened
You said you love me to fuck me outta of our friendship
Your insecurities told you to do it
Now I’m in a motel bottle of whiskey drinking praying I lose it
I’m screaming inside for help
I’m feeling abusive
God what led you to do this

HOOK [Gilbere Forte]
Motel California
I don’t wanna sleep alone
I’m talking bout
Motel California
I don’t want you sleeping alone
