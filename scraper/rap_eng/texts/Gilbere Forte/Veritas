[Verse 1]
Alliance to the money, alliance to the game
Dyin' in your mind, crazy insane
Eyes bloodshot from the motherfucking fame
I'm just trying to praise the lord, I ain't trying to take his name
You can run around the world, but you dying where you staying
We wishing you could have the life you started on your way in
Life is full of options, so watch what you saying
When she down on her knees, I hope it's only when she praying
Walking around the world, with my hands in the cloud
'87 dreams got my mother feeling proud
It's some people on this Earth, really know what I'm about
Got the northside with me, and it's trill down south
Westside hold me down, cause they love when I'm around
I'm tryna see it all, that my life is really foul
I ain't never turning back, and I ain't never looking down
On my way to the sky with my conscience on the ground
Time feels rich and I'm wealthy in the sound
Lot of pain in my heart that I can never seem to smile
A lot of women in my life, but every emotion I have now
And if my lifeâ€™s a motion picture, will you hear it in surround sound?

[Hook]
This life we made for us
(Let me know)
(So let me know)
(Please let me know)

I said, you're never gonna take it

[Verse 2]
(Never gonna take) The money, the the the money
Got it all fucked up 'till its dark, never sunny
Standing in the rain, with a pocket full of hundreds
Til it all disappears, like how the fuck I get here?
So I grab my umbrella as I'm stomping to the rain
Tryna picture heaven , she keep walking out the frame
The more I keep her waiting, the more I'm stuck in my ways
In order for me to reach her, I'm through fucking my past dates
Like this my last day, before she open the gates
Riding real low, giding real slow, skying off the haze
Send her my last prayers to the world that she came
Could have sworn I saw her face the day I was made
'87 motherfucker

[Hook]
