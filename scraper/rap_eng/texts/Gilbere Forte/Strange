[VERSE 1]
Standing on the corner, what did we do to this world
Looking at our lives, where did we fail
Why we make it ugly, why we make it hell
Why you feeling ugly
You scared to be yourselves
It's just one of those days
I don’t want to wake up
Cuz I might just wake up
And fuck shit up
Am I dreaming I don't feel demons, am I bleeding
Bloody ass nose till my mind explodes
I just wanna let go
I wanna get out
Wanna leave now, can't breath now
Wanna scream out, please leave now
Get the fuck out

[HOOK]
Am I strange to you
Am I strange to you
Am I strange to you
Am I strange to you

[VERSE 2]
Standing on the block bitch
Overnight I over clocked it, mane
You don't know what I done been through mane
Don’t be acting like I met you mane

I use to be a rat in the cage, shooting bullets with butterfly wings
My requiem for a dream, I wake up and go back to sleep
I see you again, I do life for your sentence
I sacrifice for ya forgiveness, don’t ever judge me cuz I lived it

[HOOK]
Am I strange to you
Am I strange to you
Am I strange to you
Am I strange to you
(STRANGE)

[BRIDGE]
Save, my prayers
I’m strange, to your world

[outro]
I’m not afraid
I’m not afraid to be myself
