[Intro: MempHitz]
Aye, it's so beautiful when a plan comes together
It's your boy MempHitz, you already know what this is
H-U-E-Y (remix), Bow Weezy, T-Pain, Hits Committed

[Verse 1: Huey]
It's H-U-E-Y, home fly G five
And by the look in my eyes she has nice thighs
What her mama done gave her then grew from no good to major
My pockets flooded with paper, born as a Missouri stater
Mami gon take it low if you can then touch your toes
You and your partna them, you can get dollas then
Trickin ain't in my blood, but I'ma make it rain
Too rich for dolla bills, I consider that as change
25's on my range, I know that that's a odd number
The way you tootin that thang can make the guys wonder
What's underneath or even if it's real
I'm hoping she a freak cause I ain't tryna chill
I'm tryna get it poppin, wit a shortie like mine
That's willing to drop it low enough to blow my mind
It`s H-U-E-Z and Bow Weezy
Let`s see if she can get lower than before on the remix

[Hook: Huey & Women]
Toot that thang up mami make it roll
Once you pop, pop lock it for me girl get low
If yo mama gave it to you, baby girl let it show
Once you pop lock drop it for me maybe we can roll (Ohhhh)
Pop lock and drop it
Pop lock and drop it
Pop lock and drop it
Pop lock and drop it
Pop lock and drop it
Pop lock and drop it
Pop lock and drop it
Pop lock and drop it

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
Damn lil mama I'm sayin'
Uh, all that in them jeans woo
Aye, aye, let me holla at chu for a minute
Hey what it is they call me Bow Wizzle
Now pop lock and drop for me, make that thang jiggle
She moves her hips just like Shakira
If she was in a contest she would be the winner (yep)
From Ohio all the way to St. Louis
Hey all the girls do it just put your back into it
Now shake what she gave ya, I'm talking bout ya mama
If you won't do it for me then do it for these dollas
Cause I'ma make it rain, these otha dudes is lame
They talk a good game, but they can't do the same
Now drop it up and down, now take it to the ground
If you wanna please me baby all you gotta do is
Pop, lock & drop it, but baby don't stop it
We can do it like Chris Brown girl get it "Poppin'"
Man I'm a pro, look I'm far from a rookie
Girl get your pretty self over here gimme them cookies

[Hook: Huey & Women]
Toot that thang up mami make it roll
Once you pop, pop lock it for me girl get low
If yo mama gave it to you, baby girl let it show
Once you pop lock drop it for me maybe we can roll (Ohhhh)
Pop lock and drop it
Pop lock and drop it
Pop lock and drop it
Pop lock and drop it
Pop lock and drop it
Pop lock and drop it
Pop lock and drop it
Pop lock and drop it

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
Shawty snap (yeah!)
Damn, shawty snap (shawtay!)
Yea
Now let me ask you a lil question that you never heard
How do you make them dollas disappear like I'm for real for a lack of better words
Let me introduce my friend, that's Huey and Bow Wow
And I'm the Pain better known as Teddy Penderass down
I'm G (yea), but you probably already knew that
But you didn't know that I could make you pop, lock, drop and do that
Understand I'm the baddest man alive
So let's just bend your knees and do the G 5 (now we fly)
Yea you can do it (yea), Yea know you see me (yea)
Yea you wanna be me (yea), yea you got my city (yea)
Yea know just a minute (yea), yea that's Baby Huey (yea)
Yea that's Bow Weezy (yea), yea that's Teddy Pain
I'ma make you climb the pole
Yea I'ma play you depending on how this money on the road
And I got it from my mama I ain't tryna go pro
If you pop lock drop it I might let all of this go
Oooh

[Hook: Huey]
Toot that thang up mami make it roll
Once you pop, pop lock it for me girl get low
If yo mama gave it to you, baby girl let it show
Once you pop lock drop it for me maybe we can roll (Ohhhh)

[Outro: Huey]
