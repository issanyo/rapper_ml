Cash Money
Ayo!
I do this for the hood!
Ayo!
Sean Kingston, I put that on my hood
This my life!
Yeah! Boweezy! Khaled
Ayo! Uh huh
Boweezy I put that on my hood
Everyone in the hood like me!
Put you hands up

Chorus- Sean Kingston
They see me lookin good
They sayin I done changed
Ain't a member on the block no more
But I'm still the same
So that's not the case I'm busy gettin money on tour
Man I put that on my hood, hood, hood
Man I put that on my hood, hood, hood
I'm the same man

Verse 1- Bow Wow
The boy doin numbers
I do it for colombus
I put my city on the map now go locate a compass
They sayin I done changed, attitude ain't the same
I guess this the negative effects that money brings
I'm still the same shot from buck town
Ain't nothin changed but the label, I'm reppin cash money now
Got love for the hood, I'm still givin back
And sum still hate, well boy I'm used 2 that
Uh, and I got my mom a bigger house
Do it for the people they the only ones I care about
Instead they make me out to be somethin that I'm not
Sayin that I only care about hoes in my cash knots

Chorus- Sean Kingston
They see me lookin good
They sayin I done changed
Ain't a member on the block no more
But I'm still the same
So that's not the case I'm busy gettin money on tour
Man I put that on my hood, hood, hood
Man I put that on my hood, hood, hood
I'm the same man

Verse 2- Bow Wow
Thru the recession I was helpin people thru the drought
This is for my people who is locked up and ain't gettin out
And bart came home, no more phat time
While he was locked up I made sure that his daughter fine
Yea, now that's real people, they got people registered 2 vote now how much realer do it get?
And I love givin back, puttin smiles on kids faces
Payin off tuitions makin sure they get an education. (it ain't nothin)
I would never turn my back on y'all, sis we used 2 window shop but now we tearin down the mall
Now I'm puttin up position to helpin make a difference
I know I mess up sometimes so I ask God for forgiveness

Chorus- Sean Kingston
They see me lookin good
They sayin I done changed
Ain't a member on the block no more
But I'm still the same
So that's not the case I'm busy gettin money on tour
Man I put that on my hood, hood, hood
Man I put that on my hood, hood, hood
I'm the same man
