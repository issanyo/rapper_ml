[Intro: Bow Wow]
The ring nigga yea
It's my shawty right there

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
She in that brand new Mercedes
I'm the president so that makes her my first lady
And I keep her fresh, her shoe game is crazy
You knock a broad out for the dawg, that's my baby
Fresh manicure and her nails got rinestones
Coke bottle shape with a caramel skin tone
And she be loving when I'm blowing her back out
Pulling on her hair, I'm trying not pull a track out
And just like birds do, you know I go down south
I do the thing with my tounge, you know what I'm talking bout
Hood with a little class, real cute with alotta ass
Make a nigga spend all his cash, let's go

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
K-I-S-S my A-S-S
Deuces, coupes is, roofless
So they can
K-I-S-S my A-S-S
Deuces, coupes is, roofless
I love it when they say

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I heard you was lookin for the big bad wolf
I mean the bad bitch from the big apple
I mean I make it pop like snap crackle
Lets hit that chapel, and go get a castle
Cause you know I'm the queen but I let the king roam
Cause it is going down like, syndrome
You could be Fred I'll be Wilma Flintstone
And fuck them other bitches
They could buy ya ringtone
Cuz you know I get wetter than a juice box
When I say who got the juice, I ain't talkin bout 2Pac
Sex game cold I need a hoodie
I can give you something way better than them goodies (my goodies)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
K-I-S-S my A-S-S
Dueces, coupes is, roofless
So they can
K-I-S-S my A-S-S
Dueces, coupes is, roofless
I love it when they say

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
(Hold on Nicki lemme holla at ya baby)
You know you find time for me
And when a nigga in the mood she can put it on me
She in the kitchen like a d boy she puts it down
She know my style so she don't trip when other girls around
Neighbors complain cuz at night we make alotta noise
After sex she make me tacos like in Baby Boy
She love a nigga cause I make her feel comfortable
Me and you can have a family like the Huxtables
Can't lie, ya back rubs make me feel good
That bath and body works got you smellin real good
And if I ever got in trouble she take the charge
Now that's real shit see how much she love the dawg

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
K-I-S-S my A-S-S
Deuces, coupes is, roofless
So they can
K-I-S-S my A-S-S
Dueces, coupes is, roofless
I love it when they say

[Outro: Nicki Minaj & Bow Wow]
Be fuckin my shit up and all that but listen
