Ha, ha, listen, you know I do it for the ladies
Lambourghini Moss and uh see
I done had my share with the right but um
Look there's something about you, baby
Got me going crazy and that's my lady, yeah, ha, ha

Look, it's like this girl got me going all out
I got a few sick days, yeah, I'ma call out
Scoop shorty, hit the mall then we ball out
Catch a movie, grab a bite then fall out

I got her spoiled wrotten
She keep her jaws droppin'
The latest wear she rockin'
Gotta couture poppin'
(Fresh)

And what's more shockin'
Them whores at the door knocking
Ain't worth a second in my G-shock when
She in them pumps, not them Reeboks kid

The only time we fight is on the wii boxin'
I don't even keep up with how many g's I spend
Usually I keep a safe with the key locked in
But she a new type, maybe a new wife

Maybe the one I settle with in a new life
I gotta see, it's moving fast right now
I needa have a conversation with Shad and Bow Wow
'Cause ahh

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like this
I was scared of being locked down
But you made me proud to call you my shorty

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like
It feels like I died and went to heaven
'Cause I never had no one love me like this

Like wha? Like this
Like wha? Like da,da,da,da, like this girl

I guess, I'm kinda open just sitting here hoping
That what we shared is more than a joke and
We can last like the great ones do
As long as our love for each other stays true

Look, I see the growth, we done both came a long way
Arguments here and there,fuss and fightin'
Just showing that we care can't nobody else compare
Start it over with another, neither one of us would dare

All she gotta do is holla and her baby will be there
Ain't a doubt about it in my mind that we a perfect pair
Can't think of anyone, that's how I wanna spend my years
Try my hardest not to hurt her

Hate to bring her to them tears
And I know just how it feel when I whisper in her ear
No, I let her drive a stick, she know how to work dem gears
Ain't gotta worry 'bout the chicks I meet during my career
Me going somewhere should be the last of her fears

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like this
I was scared of being locked down
But you made me proud to call you my shorty

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like
It feels like I died and went to heaven
'Cause I never had no one love me like this

She's my L.O.V.E
Used to be scared of relationships but this one I can't deny
You my L.O.V.E, yeah, and when you see her
You see me for her, I ride or die like Ruff Ryders

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like this
I was scared of being locked down
But you made me proud to call you my shorty

I had a few loves before
But I never had no one love me quite like
It feels like I died and went to heaven
'Cause I never had no one love me like this
