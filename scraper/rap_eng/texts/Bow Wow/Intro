It's like Shad Moss's diary I've been dealin' with the Price of Fame from the beginning of this year until now
Even 'til this... even 'til this day
Every artist goes through that point
You know whatever happens happens umh
That mental break down I'm dealin' wit the Price of Fame I was like I hear that term all the time
But I don't think people really understand what that means
