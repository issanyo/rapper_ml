Rather see the streak when that boy go deep

And where your man slip up
Thats where I pick up
Bitch niggas ignore me just like hiccups
Turn between your legs, eyes rollin back in yo head
We done soaked up all the sheets, fucked up your best bread
Girl you nasty, just so you know
Right back at em again, its bad when oh you know
