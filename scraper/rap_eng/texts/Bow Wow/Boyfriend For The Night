Bow wizzy

It`s Mr. do it for the ladies what it do-x2

Call your man tell him you ain`t goin home tonight
That bath and body works got your body smellin right
Panties so edible i eat through em
Fishnet top
I can see through it
Baby let`s do it
Why we wasting time
I make her get moist when i lick her waistline
You want a baller well i can go baseline
She 5+5
Yep a strait dime
She was kinda nervous thought i was like other rappers
The type that`ll fuck her then don`t call after
Uh uh
That ain`t my character
I can go all night so i hope you got stamina
Like kobe with rock
Lil mama i`d handle ya
Make ya debut press record on the camera
So everybody can watch what we doin
Tool box love
And guess whose screwin?
This is cash money so you know i got pecos
G5 jet i got my pilot on pay-roll
Beast in the sheets grizzly like mayo
Hands over her mouth and don`t speak until i say so

And like my black card i don`t get denied
I whip my dick out and then i handle mine
But let`s get x-rated
Talk dirty to me
She treat my dick like a mic and she sung to me
Huh
And i be rippin up her vocal chords
Beat it out the frame
Scream my name until your throat is sore

Man for the nite,nite,nite,nite,nite,nite
I can be man for the nite-x2
So won`t you holla at playa holla holla at plya hollat at

Playa holla holla girl-x2

Um um

I`ma beat the pussy up beat the pussy up-x4

Uh uh-x6

I bet ya i can make you leave your boyfriend
With no problem

Choop choop bitches-x4
