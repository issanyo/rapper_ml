Elllllll-beeeeeee-duuuuub [LBW]

E.N.T

Uh uh-huh UH
Uh uh-huh UH
[*rhythmic breathing*]
I just thought I'd breathe on y'all for a quick second
Matter a fact, lemme holla at chy'all

[Verse 1]
Make girls fall out, lose they mind
Girl fighting over me like Brooke Valentine (Ha, ha)
I been known get down and do my thing
Got women over thirty-five screamin' my name (Bow WOW)
Flow so insane, e'rytime I drop
Makin hits after hits, no, I won't stop (naw)
Lil' kids to adults, homey, rappin' my songs
If you though J.D. wrote this, you wrong (It's me!)
If you ask me how I'm livin', I'll tell you, "I'm great"
Money stacks taller than the Empire State (Damn!)
Hottest thing since the L.L. and Kool Moe beef
You can line them guys up, but I put 'em to sleep (that's right)
I'm the B-O-W (Who?) W-Ohhhhhh-
W - and these cats know how it go
Since thirteen, I been known for bumpin' out that steam
Ain't nuthin' changed homeboy, I'm still bringin' the heat

[Hook 2X]
And I got a pocket full of DOUGH, sold out SHOWS
Steppin' out the Phantom wit' the suicide DO'S [doors]
YEAHHHHHHHH (I'm Boooooooooooooo)
I'm the B-O-W
(ooooooooooooooooooooooow)
W-Ohhhhhhh-W (WOW!)

[Verse 2]
I'm known as the low-key Don
Get up out the stores like Pokemon - did (ha, ha)
I ain't impressed by the stuff that y'all did
Stuff that y'all did, I'm way beyond it (uh-huh)
I'm in the Phan-tom, hop out hand-some
Can't nobody do it like my grandmama grand-son (naw)
Rock shades and some Bathing APES
New cars everytime they changin' SHAPES
I had cake before, I got a lot more
Way before I did the first Scream Tour (damn!)
Whole crowd ROAR, whole team SOAR
Bring it up the back and my whole team score! (that's right)
Might scoop shorty, take her wit me to the mall
Spend a few G's, show her how a player ball (OWWWW!!)
Hit her later, show her how a player call
I got it on smash, I ain't worried...cause I got a..

[Hook]

[Bridge 2X]
Said I got a...all my people on the left
All my people on the right, all my people in the middle
Up top say
Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow WOW!

[Instrumental break]
