[Intro]
Damn Rico, you shot that nigga

[Verse 1]
(How'd you start your day, nigga?)
Woke up early, called the homies
Fixed up all the Fruit Loops and niggas feeling hungry
(Hey, what you doing?)
9.30 in the morning, check your voicemail
(Well, who that was?)
It's lil' freak named Shontelle
Hey, she from Oakland
Body like ooh-wee
And she got cool freaks and they all run deep
Remove my retro foams from the shoe box
All black e'erything, even till my fucking socks
Yeah, respect the G-code, nigga
My wrist and my ear and my neck froze, nigga
We like the blunt hash sitting in my ashtray
High as fuck playing NBA2K

[Hook]
I'm young, rich and dangerous
I'm young, rich and dangerous
I'm young, rich and dangerous
I'm young, rich and dangerous

[Verse 2]
Pass that, where the cash at?
She got a cute face, but where the ass at?
Don't trust nobody, wise words to remember
Checking for Lebron in the heat, watching SportsCenter
Getting mo' paper on the daily
Signing Cash Money, now I'm stunting like Baby
Smoking hella' kush and we hella' blow
And if I'm in the building, that means there's hella' hoes
Big socks, I got big nuts
That stupid fatty, Big Guwap
Snapback covering my season
These niggas know I'm cold like I'm freezing

[Hook]
I'm young, rich and dangerous
I'm young, rich and dangerous
I'm young, rich and dangerous
I'm young, rich and dangerous

[Bridge]
I'mma do what I wanna
I'mma do what I wanna
I'mma do what I wanna
I'mma do what I wanna
I'mma smoke when I wanna
I'mma smoke when I wanna
I'mma stunt when I wanna
I'mma stunt when I wanna
I'm young, rich and dangerous
I'm young, rich and dangerous
I'm young, rich and dangerous
I'm young, rich and dangerous

[Outro]
Man, I feel like
Half the niggas that's on the radio rapping
Them niggas ain't better than me
Nigga, I ain't gon' say no names
