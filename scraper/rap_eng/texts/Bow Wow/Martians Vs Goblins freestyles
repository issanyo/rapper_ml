Yeah, I got these niggas, legendary flow
Shit even Viagra know, shit how hard I go
Get your facts right, boy i’m too nice
Royal rumble nigga, my crew love to fight rums looki’n in hair grease road kill ya you niggas just dead meat
Cats act hard till the bitch come out
Now what happened to that tough shit you was talk about?
New album date now I got more time to shit on your rappers
Any time I feel like yeah, we don’t associate with snitches
We can keep your mouth shut, it may require a couple stitches
Hit the campus go scoop up Skylar diggins have a ride in my Ferrari, let me show you how i’m living
I’m in the spot where is rowdy talk crazy, homie
You don’t wanna get … you don’t confuse a … as a Audi
Getting head while i’m dumping weed ashes off my balcony
And if I ain’t top 7 then would you break me ass?
Because they rhyme softer than a baby ass
Shit i’m sorry… shit I had to do it
I Eazy E the whip, that mean my shit is ruthless
I’m wassup man, beat the shit out the bitch
It might need a cut man, bleed
I’m just a cool ass nigga, but don’t let these green eyes fool you my nigga
So that means don’t pop off, fuck around like your top off
You hear me son?
I’m as real as they come
And I ain’t even no gangster,at least I'm cool to admit it
Because there’s so many fake ones
Niggass saying i’m hot, but I knew that already
I’m just trying to do me, these niggas still wanna test me
Bars so cold, they need to unthaw
Since they be calling me a Snoop Dogg, homie, I’ve been raw shit
Hey hit Yonkers then I’m fucking with Kiss
But if I’m not, I’m at the trump towers, knocking you bitch
There’s only couple niggas doing it — me, Wale, J. Cole, Meek Mill, Big Sean, Machine Gun Kelly
Can’t forget about my nigga Kendrick, and for the niggas I ain’t mention, shit, I ain’t dissin’ at all
Warrup homie, what it do, bro
Replace my old women shit with my new hoes
You know how it go I’m still underrate
Me and my niggas ball harder than Gary Payton

Blackberry kush they got me feeling lazy, listen to shade 45 in the ride bad bitch by my side
YMCMB till I die, … yeah
