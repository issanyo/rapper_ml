[Lil Bow Wow]
Around here we pop them collars
Around here we get them dollars
Every girl I see that look right
A nigga like me just gotta holla
This kid here all about stackin' up
Got big head but we can back it up
Long cause everybody get crunk
When we drop in the club starts acting up
I represent the S-O-S-O, D-E-F-M-O-B
That's me, JD, Da Brat, and JE
So please believe
What I do ain't never been done
Ohio is where I'm from
I heard what you said
And I saw what you do
And y'all playas really don't want none

From the day to the night, I ROCK
Say what you like, NEVER NOT
Stayin' alive, living the life
Gots to keep it hot
Shotgun in the drop
Riding good, twenties, TVs, leather and wood
Poppin', watching Big Momma
Holdin' it down like a playa should
Sing-a-long now!
[Xscape]
All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
But around here we get it crunk when ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
All I wanna do is see ya
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Grab a partner hit the floor
Bounce with me, bounce with me
Some clap, clap others stomp
