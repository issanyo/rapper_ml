I know you tired, you fresh off the stage
Fuck your attire, just be on your way

What does your GPS say, are you close?
I don't see nothing wrong, with a little kush and wine
I don't see nothing wrong
But you keep taking your precious time
So im rolling up

For this long you ain't never had a nigga sittin'
And plus my work is on the way and i don't them in our bossiness
So you gotta hit the gas when we finish
