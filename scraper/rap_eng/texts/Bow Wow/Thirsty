Hey home boy
Hey man I don't even want your bitch

Straight like that

[Intro]
Go get your bitch
She so thirsty, she so thirsty, she so thirsty
She she she so thirsty
Calling my phone, run up my last
Never told this ho, aha, a thousand time

Drug dealer club, can barely say
With all my niggas in VIP

She give me that look then I know we're fucking
Day for the dick you nasty won't stop calling
Pop up and where I beat the hoes talking
And I even want her, this dick drove her crazy
See her girls out of pocket
Only coming bitch [?]

Come get your bitch cause she so thirsty
She so thirsty, she so thirsty

Flag on the play, go [?] down
But you know the game, lose your ho and she'll get found
She at all my shows right in the front
With the sack, they [?] I wanna fuck

Fucking all these niggas but they making no profit
Getting on my nerves, blowin' up my mentions
With the world at [?] fit that [?] still got [?]
Cause she so high, she so thirsty, she so thirsty, she so thirsty
She she she so thirsty
Calling my phone, run up my last
Never told this ho, aha, a thousand time

Come get your bitch cause she so thirsty

Calling my phone, run up my last
Never told this ho, aha, a thousand time
