Feat. Rick Ross

[Chorus: x2]
Touch 8 figgaz figgaz, touch 8 figgaz figgaz
Touch 8 figgaz, stuff it in the bank nigga nigga
Touch 8 figgaz figgaz, touch 8 figgaz figgaz
Touch 8 figgaz, stuff it in the bank nigga nigga

[Verse 1]
Bad bitches when I'm roamin up
Zippin the kush til we smoke it up
We nip the bitches, start actin up
Get em off the molly and they'll loosen up
Getting bread, nigga wutchu sayin?
Nigga what trick? Wutchu sayin bitch?
I stunt hard, drove on the lot
Then I drove up with 6 whips
My homies ground, they all put in work
My niggas don't play that
I've got new money and old money
I'm still spending shit from way back
I'm here now if they don't know
Neck cold like a winter in Chicago

[Chorus: x2]
Touch 8 figgaz figgaz, touch 8 figgaz figgaz
Touch 8 figgaz, stuff it in the bank nigga nigga
Touch 8 figgaz figgaz, touch 8 figgaz figgaz
Touch 8 figgaz, stuff it in the bank nigga nigga

[Verse 2]
Ball so hard, aye Ross they tryna scout a nigga
I'm in the club, I spend a couple thousand nigga
Ain't nothing to a nigga, I'm a make it back
Heard as bread, I'm sayin I'm a double that
We had to win, that's at least 35 a night
I'm at the table breakin babies on the dice
Takin my image, takin picture, bitch I'm fresh tonight
Can get down with my team if you do it right

[Chorus: x2]
Touch 8 figgaz figgaz, touch 8 figgaz figgaz
Touch 8 figgaz, stuff it in the bank nigga nigga
Touch 8 figgaz figgaz, touch 8 figgaz figgaz
Touch 8 figgaz, stuff it in the bank nigga nigga

[Bridge: x2]
Yea, I'm bout to show these niggas how we ball
Yea, I'm bout to show these niggas how we ball
Yea, I'm bout to show these niggas how we ball
Yea, I'm bout to show these niggas how we ball

[Chorus: x2]
Touch 8 figgaz figgaz, touch 8 figgaz figgaz
Touch 8 figgaz, stuff it in the bank nigga nigga
Touch 8 figgaz figgaz, touch 8 figgaz figgaz
Touch 8 figgaz, stuff it in the bank nigga nigga
