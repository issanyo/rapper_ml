Mind on my money, niggas still hatin'
Smoke a lot of weed because I have little patience
My girl still trippin', shit what girl don't bitch?
Turn the volume up on the T.V so I don't hear shit
Wizzle keep it playa', ballin' like a Laker
They say the game is rough, well I'm gone' give that bitch a shape-up
Ohio is the state, Columbus is the city
I know yo' ass is real, but how much you pay for them titties ?
Cash Money Gang, you know what I'm reppin'
My homie doin' 9, he just got caught up with a weapon
My lil' girl gettin' bigger, she crawlin' trynna talk
Shit, I'm tryin' do whatever just to stay off child support
If ya' album don't sell, Bow what yo gone' do ?
Probably keep makin' 8 mill a movie, i'll be cool
Cause' I ain't trippin' bout' these critics
Or these non-believers
And I keep the lord close, I rock my Jesus pieces
Turnin' 25 soon, that's five years from thirty
I'm feelin' forty now, I lived my life too early
I'm in my own world, playin' by my own rules
They say life is about choices so be careful what you choose
I'm ridin' with my homies, they got love for me
I keep my eyes open, cause' niggas can be boney
So I stay off by my lonely
Short, but got a lot of heart
Damn I love my women, redbone, white or dark
You say you blowin' on that good, shit I can't tell
Cause the shit Iâ€™m smokin' got me movin' slower than a snail
And while you squares hate, we keep gettin' richer
Laughin' back at yall, while we fuckin' all yall bitches
Playin' John Madden, I'm runnin' with the eagles
Niggas online talkin' shit until I beat you
Real shit, I ain't slept in two days
I been up strategizing on ways to get paid
