I ain't never had nobody show me all the things
That you done showed me and the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby, that's what you told me
And I believe it 'cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you
Now, I done been with different kind of girls
Like I done seen 'em all but ain't none of them at all like you
And I done seen the best of the best
Baby, still I ain't impressed 'cause ain't none of them at all like you
If you know how I feel when I chill
If I'm seen with a girl then she gotta be just like you
And baby, that's the way I feel
And I got no choice but for me to keep it real
'Cause when we first got together started hanging out you was
Skeptical at first had to figure out if
I was the kind of guy to try to dog you out but
I ain't that kind of guy you tried to make me out
You found out when you turned 'to my baby
I showed them other brothers how to treat a lady
I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes
And I ain't trippin' or actin' shady 'cause baby you know
I ain't never had nobody show me all the things
That you done showed me and the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby, that's what you told me
And I believe it 'cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you
And every time I think about you I fly
When you ride, when you call, when you come I ride
Your love is amazing to me
Can't wait 'til I see you, I wanna be wit you again
And every time you're out on the road, I make a trip
And whenever I'm doing a show, don't you forget
That I'm your main chick, who got that game chick
One and the same chick, the one you can hang with
I ain't never had nobody show me all the things
That you done showed me and the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby, that's what you told me
And I believe it 'cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you
Okay, we hit the mall pop tags spend a few g's in
Hit the runway to a new season
It ain't nothin', [Incomprehensible] the one I care for
Feel like I ain't doing enough that's when I share more
I give you this, give you that what you need love
You know I got it holler at me if you need love
And affection 'cause I'll be your protection
Kinda hard job but I'll do it to perfection
And you can tell that I ain't tryna let you go
I get with you when I can, so that's how I let you know
And you be trippin' 'cause sometimes I gotta go
But you the first one I holler to right after my shows
And I was trippin' in a sense I was tense
From my body loose around you what I'ma do without you
I gotta get it together say whatever
Since, I met you my life seems so better
I ain't never had nobody show me all the things
That you done showed me and the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby, that's what you told me
And I believe it 'cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you
I ain't never had nobody show me all the things
That you done showed me and the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby, that's what you told me
And I believe it 'cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you
