[Verse 1:]
It’s like any girl that I meet
Any girl that I kick it with
It always starts out cool
But is all some different shit
Shit how could in love her?
Can I trust her?
I ain't the only one
I know she out here fucking others
Hit her on the text, she don't reply back
Fly nigga, can’t deny that
Why I always attract the women with the bad rap?
These hoes addicted to the life style
So how am I posed to trust this bitch
Fell out over some stupid shit
Heard she was sucking Drizzy’s dick
All the subliminals on the Instagram
It’s like trying to get cute
You don’t know who you’re playing with ma
I’m a grown ass man
Playing me for a game
Texting me the same message that you just text Wayne
Hoping that re-image of me is a memory
More niggas have been in your mouth, then a dentistry
Better run that game to the lames, cause I ain't the same
And after years of being hurt, you can deal with the pain

[Hook:]
See when I first met her, she was nothing like this
Introduce you to the game, girl I made you that bitch
Drop that top, raries in the summer
Hat that pussy gaining mileage, heard it’s doing numbers
Now you with a different man every day of the week
It’s like 4-5-6 niggas laying in your sheets
If I knew what I know now
I wouldn’t have wasted my time
You nasty as fuck
Shorty you really wasting mine

[Verse 2:]
Shit I made bad choices with women
Shit we all did that
I got a daughter
Gotta make sure she don’t grow up like that
Caught this girl in plenty lies
Fucked up a lot of lives
Angel in the face but she a devil in disguise
Giving that pussy up for free
Ain't getting shit in return
Bounce her from dick to dick
I’m like bitch when will you learn?
All out of control
Mr Marley, probably
Now your pussy all stretched out
Looking all sloppy
Had you flying around the world on some G4 shit
We were downgrading, now you just some sky miles bitch
I feel for you, you moving in the wrong direction
Yeen moving forward, gotta keep pushing
Sorry if I do ignore you, girl that’s life
Posed to learn from your mistakes, you make the same ones twice
And I don’t know if you’re ever gonna get it
See that’s your problem now
You don’t listen and you don’t pay attention

[Hook:]
See when I first met her, she was nothing like this
Introduce you to the game, girl I made you that bitch
Drop that top, raries in the summer
Hat that pussy gaining mileage, heard it’s doing numbers
Now you with a different man every day of the week
It’s like 4-5-6 niggas laying in your sheets
If I knew what I know now
I wouldn’t have wasted my time
You nasty as fuck
Shorty you really wasting mine

[Interlude:]
I don’t really give a fuck about what you do or anything
I just care about just keeping 100 with the nigga
That’s all I’m saying though
She gone tell me
She ain’t in town when I touch down
She know
You know how I do I hit the club and shit
You know my nigga Meek like I’m on the way
Next thing you know the bitch walk in with Meek
And I’m like ain't you posed to be outta town bitch

[Hook:]
