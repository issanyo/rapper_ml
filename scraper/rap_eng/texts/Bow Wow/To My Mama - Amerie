Yeah, this song right here is dedicated to that one special woman in my life, right
(Thank you for loving me) My Mother
(And thank you for holding me down) Theresa
(I know that you care for me) Rene
('cause you've always been around) Sing it
Ma (Thank you for loving me) This song right here is for you
(I wanna thank you for holding me down) All the love you showed me
(I know that you care for me) I'ma give it right back to you
Let's go

[Chorus]
All of the things you do (yeah)
I can never repay you (uh huh)
I can't imagine life without you
My mama, my road dog
All of the things you do (yeah
I can never repay you (ah uh)
I can't imagine life without you
My mama, my road dog

[Verse 1:]
Anything you need from me, Ma, you know that it's yours
You're the only woman in my life that I adore
I remember back in the days when we couldn't get much
TV's wasn't covered and the floor was tore up
How you juggle three jobs just to take care of me
Yo baby boy, Bow Weezy
Late night shifts, daytime to the AM
Comin' home late, there was my best friend
My soulmate, yes, my big brother
The one who tucked me in, put me under the covers
When I had nightmares, you came right away
Read me bedtime stories and chased them away
My beautiful black queen, my everything
The one that keeps this heart pumpin' everyday
I'm a young man now
But my plan is to show you that I really understand
Mom, I love you

[Chorus 2x:]
All of the things you do
I can never repay you
I can't imagine life without you
My mama, my road dog

[Verse 2:]
Look at you now
You sittin' up on top of the world
Got a X5 and a Benz just to swerve
Gotcha dream house now
Sittin' on big land, big money, big jewels, big game plan
You told me one day I'ma make it this far
Have God in my life and I'm gon' be the star
I did it, well, look where we at
Don't have to worry 'bout past due bills and all that
Don't have to worry 'bout them bill collectors all on yo back
Don't worry
If you ain't got it, I gotcho back
Don't even worry 'bout you workin 3 jobs real late
Don't even have to worry when you have no food to put on the plate
Back then, I didn't understand but I do now
I look back and I reminisce on how it all went down
Went from bad to good, from frowns to smiles
Mom, I really love you, understand now
I love you

[Chorus 2x]

[Hook:]
Thank you for loving me
Say what now
Thank you for holding me down
Say what now
I know that you care for me
Sing that
'cause you've always been around
Kick it back and
Thank you for loving me
Say what now
Thank you for holding me down
Say what now
I know that you care for me
Say what
'cause you've always been around
Drop the beat back
