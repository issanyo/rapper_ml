[Hook: Soulja Boy]
My shootas coolin' with them MACs out
Ay, I got bricks posted in my traphouse
Don't make me bring them bands out
Pistols on the floor, choppa on the couch in my traphouse
In my traphouse, in my traphouse
Pistols on the floor, choppa on the couch in my traphouse
In my traphouse, in my traphouse
In my traphouse, in my traphouse

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Bricks in the traphouse
Shootas that post with the MAC out
Standin' in the kitchen with the bricks ship 'em out
Nigga tried to rob draco I whip it out
150 bricks send to my momma's house
I'll murder 350 bricks send 'em out
(?) yungins nigga don't see no drought
Kickin' yo' door with them choppas and uzis out
Feelin' like DJ Khaled got them keys
Bad bitch and she in believe
50 thousand for the (?) my rollie I'm free
Runnin' my wrist til it bleed
Draco knock him and his shirt off in flee
I came up off from servin' jankys on Sunset Street
Pull on the block with the heat
Zone 3 and Zone 1 ain't know 'bout me

[Hook: Bow Wow]
Bad bitches runnin' all naked in my house
I'm so lazy I got elevators in my house
Don't make me bring them bands out
Yo' bitch at my house my dick in her mouth
Then she at my house (pull up)
Bring them MACs out

Got so many clothes that I had go and buy another house
Nigga my house
Nigga my house
Yo' bitch in the neighborhood, coolin' and givin' pussy out

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
Lil young nigga stay flexin'
Just blew a bag on necklace

Say I've been spendin' money reckless
Fuck that I'm young and got a bag on me
Block Versace get to the swag homie
Hoes follow me like there's Axe on me
Ask Keyshia Cole that's facts homie
Run through it brought a couple mill in it
A lil (?) jacuzzi wanna swim through it
'Bout to take yo' bitch and make a movie wit it
Finger yo' bitch always wanna finger it
And we don't do it for the snapchat uh
So fuck the comments and the rapbacks uh
Keep it private when I'm with these hoes
Can't go out like Derrick Rose
Young rich nigga I'mma big deal
All this ice on me check the windshield
And I know why this fuck niggas always wanna hate
'Cause their hoe wanna ride me like a big whip
(?)
So when you hit up Bow you better get that shot you better push that start nigga that's yo' top
I'm 'bout to kill in it
Big house in Bellaire like Will with it
Indoor pool bitch I'm ill with it
When it's time yo' nigga be still swimmin'
Niggas mad 'cause we stil winnin'
Trapway nigga like a call out
100 bands spendin' like Rick Ross
'Bout to buy another mansion
Rollies on 'em diamonds dancin'

[Hook: Soulja Boy & Bow Wow]
Bad bitches runnin' all naked in my house
