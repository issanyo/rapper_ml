[JD] [Intro]
Uh-huh, ha, ha
Sing for me

[Jessica](JD)
You know
I don't know what it is
(It's the remix)
But everything about you is so irresistible

[Lil Bow Wow] [Verse 1]
For sure (So So Def)
It's the 2k top dawn
Don't nobody want it
I got 10K on it, I'm the hottest thing out
If you look at me, you're looking at a kid with a plan
If you don't understand homie, check sound scan
So So Def to grain
You know our motto
In the street throwing paper like we just won the lotto
Guest on the beat, like dubs hit on the six
Irresistible to all chicks
Listen to the remix

[Jessica](JD)
Don't you try to tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside
When he makes me weak with desire
I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase
But I can't stop fanning the fire
I know I'm meant to say no
(Uh, uh, hand clap, oh)

[Jessica] [Chorus]
But he's irresistible
Up close and personal
Now inescapable
I can hardly breathe
More than just physical
Deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
Irresistible to me

[Verse 2]
Oh I can hardly breathe, yeah
Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right
That I should really say goodnight
But I just can't stop myself
Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same
That I don't want to play no game
Because when I feel his arms hooked around me
I know I'm meant to say no (I'm meant to say no)
(Clap your hands)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Can't you see
Whenever he's close to me
I really find it hard to breathe
He's so irresistible
Think you know
Deeper than spiritual
His ways are powerful
He's so irresistible
(You're so irresistible)
Like that, oh

[Chorus]
