[Lil' Jon (Mario in background)]
Back at y'all again, baby (That's how I go)
It's ya boy, Lil' Jon (That's how I go)
That boy, Baby Bash
Mario (That's how I go, how I go, how I go)
Show 'em how we go

[Verse 1: Baby Bash & Mario]
I let the roof drop
Drippin' candy with super Bambi
In my new car
And I'm glad that she love to have me
I'm like, "Oooh, Lord"
From Jamaica to Puerto Rico
Down to Utah
From Miami to California
They some cool broads
Haters tell me they can't be mad
At my new job
We be goin' hard in the paint
Like a hoop star
It's a feeling, lick-licking good
Like a full course
Give it to you, girl, enough to tell ya, baby
You smart
If ya like it, you know I love it
Baby, two more
And the smell of that sweet Chenel
Girl, it never fail
We can fly away on this drive, baby
Heads or tail
And oh yeah
And oh yeah

Chorus: Baby Bash & Mario
I said, I met a lot of ladies and, travelled the world
Sometimes, I party like crazy, showin' love to the girls
That's how I go, that's how I go
Girl, that's how I go, girl
I go and go, that's how I go
Girl, that's how I go, girl
And then my pockets look, gravy, with
Plenty to give
Somebody 'bout to have my baby and a key to my crib
That's how I go, that's how I go
Girl, that's how I go, girl
I go and go, that's how I go
Girl, that's how I go, girl

[Verse 2: Baby Bash & Mario {Baby Bash *slowed down*}]
I said
"Man, girl, you think it's five o'clock traffic on that 101"
Maybe later on tonight, me and you can have ourselves a one-on-one
I swear I seen you somewhere else
Maybe it was on the movie screen
Maybe it was on a television, or on the cover of a magazine
I know and I don't care
Let me see your underware
Let me see how thick you is, baby, let me see what's under there
Everybody know, we go, go, go, go, oh so fast, when I'm on my grind
But I can't lie, when I seen that ass, {I slowed it down and took, my, time}

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Baby Bash, Grimm, Rasheed & Mario
[Bash & Grimm] Well, I gotta read our flights, and I check another photo shoot
Girl, I gotta go, I gotta do another interview
[Grimm] Studio tonight
[Rasheed] Another banger you could listen to
[Bash & Mario] Baby, you ain't even gotta ask
[Grimm] You know I'm missing you
[All] The money keep comin', girl, cause, we keep goin'
[Rasheed] And we go and go and go and go and go
[All] And keep goin'
[All] Yeah, the money keep comin', girl, cause, we keep goin'
[Rasheed] And we go and go and go and go and go
[All] And keep goin'

Repeat Chorus

[Mario]
That's how we go
