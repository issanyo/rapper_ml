[Chorus]
I ain't ever had nobody show me all the things

That you done showed me

In a special way I feel when you hold me

We gon' always be together baby

That is what you told and

I believe it cause I ain't never had

Nobody do me like you

[Bow Wow]

Now I done been with different kind of girls

So like I done seen them all

But ain't none of them at all (like you)

And I done seen the best of the best

Baby, still I ain't impressed cause

Ain't none of them at all (like you)

If you know how I feel when I chill

Look, if I'm seen with a girl

Then she gotta be just (like you)

And baby thats the way I feel

And I ain't got no choice

But for me to keep it real

Cause when we first got together

Starting hanging out you was skeptical at first

Had to figure out if

I was the kind of guy that

Would try to dog you out but

I ain't that kind of guy you try to make me out

You found out when you turned to my baby

I showed them other brothers

How to treat a lady

I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes

And I ain't trippin' or actin' shady

Cause baby you know

[Chorus]
[Ciara]

And everytime I think about you I smile

When you ride, when you call, when you come around

Your love is amazing to me

I can't wait till I see you (I wanna be with you again)

And everytime your out on the road (I'll make a trip)

And whenever I'm doing a show (Don't you forget)

That I'm your main chick

Who got that game chick

One in the same chick

The one you can hang with

[Chorus]
[Bow Wow]

Ok we hit the mall, pop tags

Spend a few G's (Cheesin')

Hit the runway to a new season

It ain't nothing

Spoil the one I care for

Feel like I ain't doin' enough

That's when I shape off

I give you this, give you that

What chu need love

You know I got it

Holla at me if you need love

In affection cause I'll be your protection

Kind of hard job but I'll do till perfection

And you can tell that I ain't tryin' to let you go

I get with you when I can

So thats how I let you know

And you be trippin' cause sometimes I gotta go

But chu the first one

I hollared to right after my show

Hey now I was trippin' in a sense

I was tense but my body's lose around you

But I'ma do without you

I gotta get it together, say whateva

Since I met you my life seems so better

[Chorus] - 2X
