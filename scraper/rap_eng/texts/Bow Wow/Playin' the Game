[Introduction: Jermaine Dupri & Bow Wow]
Just Blaze, make it knock
Ladies, if you walking through the mall and you hear somebody say
You gotta turn back at 'em, and you know what? I gotta do the same thing (c'mon)
Hahahaha (tell 'em whassup) - it's that new two-thousand-three call, ladies. For sho'
Hahahahaha - for shizzle
It's so, so Def

[Hook]
All I'm trynna do is get my doe up
I'm your boy, you're my girlfriend - stop! Hold up!
I ain't in no kinda rush to grow up
So slow up - I'm just playing the game
Warn you girl before you get involved with me
You might think you got me
But you'll never really get me
Uh uh, so don't trip if you see me doing my thang
I told ya I'm just playing the game

[Verse 1]
I'm at the mall on Saturday
I ain't got no cap on my salary
So you know, I'm tearin' it up
I mean there's so many girls here
Every time I look, I see them lookin' back at me and they sayin' 'What up?'
I'm too young to wife her, and so you know my game bumpin'
Like 'Baby, let's talk, let's hang; do somethin'!'
'What about them digits can I get that?'
She write 'em down, I give a pound and say 'Ma, holla back!'
Next door's just more of the same activity
I'm up in Tiffany's, talking to this girl named Britney
She trynna roll wit' me, she trynna shop wit' me
She trynna do whatever it takes to get wit' me
Like I'm easy
How you gon' act like my name ain't Bow Weezy?
And I ain't got breezys'
Comin' by the dozen, that's why the phone buzzin'
I'm sorry, but I ain't lookin' for no long time lovin', girl

[Verse 2]
It's hard to hold back when you fifteen
Got money by the stacks, jumpin' outta candy colored 'Lacs
Every show packed to the rim, girl's screaming at me
'Ooh, why, you made me happy, I just wanna ride, Daddy'
Am I wrong, for not wantin' to be tied up?
When I'm grown, maybe baby we can ride, but
For right now, I'm just trying a lil game in your life
And doin' it right, and see whoever I like
I'm trynna find me somethin' every city I go
From New York, to LA, back to Ohio
I'm trynna find me somethin' a little ghetto
Pretty and fun, fifteen to twenty-one
Is that true? If it is, when you hear I'm comin' to your city, make sure you're in the front row
Hands in the air, scream it loud as you can
Here I am, here I am - Bow Weezy, let's go!

[Hook]
All I'm trynna do is get my doe up
I'm your boy, you're my girlfriend - stop! Hold up!
I ain't in no kinda rush to grow up
So slow up - I'm just playing the game

You might think you got me
But you'll never really get me
Yeah, so don't trip if you see me doing my thang
I told ya I'm just playing the game

[Outro]
(Tell 'em how you playin' the game)
Yeah, Bow Weezy
Aye, check it man, I'm Fifteen years old, I just got my tints
You know, I'm on a pace right now, man
I can't be slowin' down
I need a girl that's gon' ride wit' me
So check it, if you that girl - c'mon, c'mon, c'mon - LET'S GO!
