Hair nappy but I'm happy
Pocket full of dough
From the C-O representing So So
The girls recognize and these niggas do too
I'm the flyest thing walking through jr. high school
So make room next to your little backstreet poster
Cause bow wow's here and it's over
Ya heard
I'm this
I'm that
I'm all of the above
And a big body shotgun riding on dubs
I've been seen with the baddest
Heard with the best
And I got it locked down from the east to the west
Look in my eyes yall know
I ain't playing
That's why all through the streets all I'm hearing niggas saying is
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yea
Where my dogs at bark wit me now
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yea
And all my girls around the way that love how it's going down say
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yea
Where my dogs at bark wit me now
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yea
And all the girls around the way that love how it's going down
Now that the gate's wide open it is I who
They running from
Little with the ill crossover
Like Iverson in 2k
My way I'm the first to rock
First to drop
Nice and embezzled of a g-shop

Like Big and Pac
I'm hard to forget
What makes it even worseI'm just getting started
Yeah that's me
That's got your daughter in a frenzy
Yeah that's me
That's got her arguing with her friends
About who gone get me when they see me
Saying do you see him ooh he the man
13
Game lock
Don't trip
All that in a bag of chips
Hi my name is
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yea
Where my dogs at bark wit me now
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yea
And all my girls around the way that love how it's going down say
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yea
Where my dogs at bark wit me now
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yea
And all the girls around the way that love how it's going down
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yea
Woof mother*****
That dog game to play
Calgon calgon take me away
I'm in the dirty dirty with my nephew J
Dizzy izzy boy we getting bizzy
With little Bow wizzy
This s*** is off the heezy
I threw him like a frisbee
Yeah he came back
Like a boomerang

Dog pound gang
Hundred thousand dollar chains
What you say JD
Bling bling
Money ain't a thang
You ask me again
I'mma tell you the same
I'm flipping on these niggas
While I'm tripping on these niggas
Buck 1, Buck 2, Buck 3, Buck 4
You standing on a wall
Nigga bust a
But you can't trust her
That's good game
You all my niggas
Represent your thang
Put it up
Now click clack it up
And all them hoes back it up
Cuz I wanna smack it up
We do it to you doggie style
Big Bow Wow in your mouth
Bow Wow
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yea
Where my dogs at bark wit me now
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yea
And all my girls around the way that love how it's going down say
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yea
Where my dogs at bark wit me now
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yea
And all the girls around the way that love how it's going down
