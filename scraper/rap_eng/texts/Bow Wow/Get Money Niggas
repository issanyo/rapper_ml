[Verse 1: Bow Wow]

Holy shit look at the life I live (Damn)
I used to be broke like ligaments
And nigga I’m rich
And now that boy got chips, like Ruffles, Lays
And you can say I’m short, but you can’t say I ain’t paid
You want to talk cribs? See my shit on the lake
Twenty thousand square feet, see that’s a private estate
Helicopter pad for when I make them private escapes
So when it’s time to get that money nigga, I’m never late
I’m still the prince of the O-town
Make them hoes go down
Since I turned 21
I don’t know how to act
Hopping out different whips
And smashing like err chick
I don’t know bout ya’ll
But this the life I live
They call me

[Hook]
