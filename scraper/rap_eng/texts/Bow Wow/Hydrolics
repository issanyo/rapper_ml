Listen

So I'mma heat it up
And if little mama throw it at me
I'ma beat it up
See it's nothing
If she ain't about something. (Uh-huh)
Then I gotta next her
On to the next one. (Next)
And she's bad, (Bad)
So I might holler. (Holler)
She moves up and down
Like a 6-4 impala. (6 6 6)

And she don't like lames, (Nope)
She likes rich cats, (Come On)
That's heavy in the game

Thumping your trunk
Make the speakers bump. (Uh-huh)
Hit the switch on the 6-4

Clean to the floor
