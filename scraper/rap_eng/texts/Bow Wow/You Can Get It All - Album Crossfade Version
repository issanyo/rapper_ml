Uh, uh, uh, got me like woo-hoo
When I think about you
That's the first thing that come to my mind
I'm like woo-hoo baby, you can get it all
You can get it all, you can get it
Woo-hoo, when I think about you
That's the first thing that come to my mind
I'm like woo-hoo shawtie, you can get it all
You can get it all
I know you heard my reputation
You don't think I would ever do right by you
You think that if you and I was in a relationship
I would never be true
(Be true)
You think that anything I say is straight gang
And to me you're just another new name
But what I'm tryna tell you for every man
There's a woman that'll make him change
And I believe you the one that'll make me
But any time I try to show you you shake me
I know I make it real hard for you to take me serious
But baby girl I am
(I am)
And I ain't stoppin' right here, I'ma keep going
And I'm gonna make sure everyday that you keep knowing
Weather if I have to send you flowers
Or talk to you on the cell phone for few hours
I'm yellin' like
Woo-hoo, when I think about you
That the first thing that come to my mind
I'm like woo-hoo baby, you can get it all
You can get it all, you can get it
Woo-hoo, when I think about you
That's the first thing that come to my mind
I'm like woo-hoo shawtie, you can get it all
You can get it all
(One, one, one, one)
One minute you act like you like me
And then the next you don't
You still sending me crazy emails
Like I know it's just sex you want
I can't lie the sex is truly incredible
And every part of your body's so edible
I get tears from just thinking bout it
But that ain't the reason why I'm stuck and can't let you go
We got a serious, serious bond
And when we kick it we have nothin' but fun
I feel a whole lot of L O V E between you and me
Even though we still young
Just your company ain't gotta get none
Talk the same lingo, understand where I'm coming from
And if anybody ask me a question about you
I'ma tell 'em you the one, you got me like
Woo-hoo, when I think about you
That's the first thing that come to my mind
I'm like woo-hoo baby, you can get it all
You can get it all, you can get it
Woo-hoo, when I think about you
That's the first thing that come to my mind
I'm like woo-hoo shawtie, you can get it all
You can get it all, you can get it
As long as you know that I can have any girl I want to
Baby, that sexual and factual
But still I choose you to be with me and we're gonna
So you better not break it up, you got me like
Woo-hoo, when I think about you
That the first thing that come to my mind
I'm like woo-hoo baby, you can get it all
You can get it all, you can get it
Woo-hoo, when I think about you
That's the first thing that come to my mind
I'm like woo-hoo shawtie, you can get it all
You can get it all, you can get it
