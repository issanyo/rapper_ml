[Intro]
Yeah
As we proceed, to give you what you need
Yeah, bitches in
Bad Boy

[Chorus]
Ass so fat, got a nigga like woah (woah)
Got me fucked up in the head, I mean woah (woah)
Should've seen the way shorty took it to the floor
Can you do that on my dick is what a nigga wanna know

[Verse]
How much do it cost? Girl what's the price?
Off two mollies, I'ma fuck her all night
Shorty what's the deal? Baby can I feel?
Did you see a doctor? Is that ass real?
Ass on Nicki, attitude like Cardi
She turn up on Ciroc, we don't drink fuckin' Bacardi
Pussy on 10, ass just crazy
Puff, I don't know but she might just have by baby

[Chorus]
Ass so fat, got a nigga like woah (woah)
Got me fucked up in the head, I mean woah (woah)
Should've seen the way shorty took it to the floor
Can you do that on my dick is what a nigga wanna know

[Verse]
She a super freak, shorty with the business
When she suck the dick, she passed out like Wendy Williams
Money to the ceiling
Pussy, I'ma kill it
Broke the money counter tryna count up all these millions
Say you got a man but he ain't gotta know
He ain't got no credit plus, you know that he broke
You know he a joke
Kush what I smoke
Open up wide, baby can you deep throat?

[Chorus]
Ass so fat, got a nigga like woah (woah)
Got me fucked up in the head, I mean woah (woah)
Should've seen the way shorty took it to the floor
Can you do that on my dick is what a nigga wanna know
Bad Boy
How much do it cost? Girl what's the price?
Off two mollies, I'ma fuck her all night
She a super freak, shorty with the business
When she suck the dick, she passed out like Wendy Williams
I like this one
Ass so fat, got a nigga like woah
Got me fucked up in the head, I mean woah
Should've seen the way shorty took it to the floor
Can you do that on my dick is what a nigga wanna know
As we proceed, to give you what you need
