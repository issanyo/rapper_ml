Soulja!

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
That way, That way, That way
Mess with lil soulja it's gun play (Bow!)
I'm sipping lean no Bombay (no Bombay)
I hit the trap with my Kanye's (Errr!)

Yuhh,  Versace my Ash Tray (My ash tray)
Whip up a brick in my Kanye's (My Kanye's)
That way, That way, That way, That way, That way, That way, That way, That way, That way, That way

Messing with my jello on the runway (Errr!)

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
20,000 on 2k (on 2k)
Ferogamma call me 2k (2k)
Finessing the plug in my Kanye's
Don't run up nigga I ain't Kim K
I'm in the kitchen whipping Whitney
Shot the Draco clip till it's empty
Riding in the Bentley me and Sydney
Jump out the coupe went on a shopping spree
Hop out the coupe me and Jordan Marie
My wrist costs about 3 keys
Me and lotto savage came out serving in Zone 3
South of the border they don't know about me
Serving dope to the whole football team
20,000 in my locker
Principal ain't know I've been trapping them things

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
That way, That way, That way
Mess with lil soulja it's gun play (Bow!)
I'm sipping lean no Bombay (no Bombay)
I hit the trap with my Kanye's (Errr!)
That way, That way
Yuhh,  Versace my Ash Tray (My ash tray)
Whip up a brick in my Kanye's (My Kanye's)
That way, That way, That way, That way, That way, That way, That way, That way, That way, That way
I hit the trap with my Kanye's (My Kanye's)
I'm sipping lean no Bombay (no Bombay)
Mixing up my jello on the runway
That way, That way

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]

Marble floors all through the hallway (Yeah)
Walk into the bank and I look like money
Tell em point to the vault tell me that way
Race checks on the runway (Shhh)
Spent a 100 thou that's a light day (Yeah)
Driving a Lambo like a Nascar (Skrrt)
Treat a freeway like the speedway (Yeah)
You ain't even seen this coming (No)
We ain't got stinking like onions (Wuu)
Skinny Jeans pocket full of 100's (Racks)
Whatever you done did we have done it (Yeah)
Homie I just iced out the Rolly (Bling)
Pull up in the spur no Ginobli (Skrrt)
Everywhere I go boy they know me (Yeah)
Spend a couple mil with my homies

[Hook: Soulja Boy]

Mess with lil soulja it's gun play (Bow!)
