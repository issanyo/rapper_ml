[Verse 1: Bow wow]
Got so much to talk about but I don’t know where to start at
Speaking in code cause they got my homies phone tapped
Y’all niggers don’t know bow, y’all go about what rumors say
Baby moms get paid every first I know I can’t be late
I’m still in love with Angela, you niggers are amateurs
Eat these rappers ho cause on these fucking beats I damage yo
Cook these niggers like the forman grill, lost 1000 and kobe shitting, no big deal
And I know that I’m the best, this ain’t the liquor talking
He’s the only competition and that niggas from New Orleans
I hate these new niggers, talkin to you nigga
Class in session, take em to school nigga

[Hook: Bow Wow]
I wanna say what’s on my mind, get paper fuck if you don’t like it
Homie I’m just being me, chill you’re drinking too much
I can handle all my liquor, fuck is wrong with you nigga
Am I really tripping hard, hard, damn you’re drinking too much
I wanna say what’s on my mind, get paper fuck if you don’t like it
Homie I’m just being me, chill you’re drinking too much
I can handle all my liquor, fuck is wrong with you nigga
Am I really tripping hard, hard, damn you’re drinking too much

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
That Cincinnati reds fitted, but I don’t wear it like a pitcher
Say my name in one of your rhymes and I just might have to diss you
Get the picture, I’m the coldest, my neck and wrist is frozen
I swear they spiked my drink because my fucking lips is swollen
Kill all my competitors, bitch I’m on some boss shit
If double X L (XXL) don’t give me the cover, I’m blowing up there offices
See this time, I ain’t playing around
You fuck boys done slipped up
Yeah I say I love you, my girl don’t trip much
My main girl a stripper, she love my country grammar
? and he hit her with the hammer
I’m sitting at the bar drinking my life away
Hoping that this liquor calm my nerves and take my stress away

[Hook: Bow Wow]
I wanna say what’s on my mind, get paper fuck if you don’t like it
Homie I’m just being me, chill you’re drinking too much
I can handle all my liquor, fuck is wrong with you nigga
Am I really tripping hard, hard, damn you’re drinking too much
I wanna say what’s on my mind, get paper fuck if you don’t like it
Homie I’m just being me, chill you’re drinking too much
I can handle all my liquor, fuck is wrong with you nigga
Am I really tripping hard, hard, damn you’re drinking too much

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
Fuck gossip, get up out my bizness
Everyone got their opinions on your boy havin children
This is my life, bitch go live yours
I'mma wyl out, my phantom got 2 doors
See that’s enough for 2 whores
Fuckin with these guys is lame, been getting bread since my motherfucking death row days
They want that underrated shit
I’m hella faded bitch, young money, cash money
We the greatest, eat a dick

[Hook: Bow Wow]
I wanna say what’s on my mind, get paper fuck if you don’t like it
Homie I’m just being me, chill you’re drinking too much
I can handle all my liquor, fuck is wrong with you nigga
Am I really tripping hard, hard, damn you’re drinking too much
I wanna say what’s on my mind, get paper fuck if you don’t like it
Homie I’m just being me, chill you’re drinking too much
I can handle all my liquor, fuck is wrong with you nigga
Am I really tripping hard, hard, damn you’re drinking too much
