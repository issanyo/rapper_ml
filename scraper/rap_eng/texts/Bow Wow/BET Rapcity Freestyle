[Verse one: Bow Wow]
Picture me and Pamela Lee in a drop
I show her how a real kid rocks
Me and Kelis on the beach having fun
Her cell rung 9-1-1, it's God's son
I don't wait I just wait to they really ready
I told usher I got it bad for Chilli
Told Jermaine me and Janet had a thing
He couldn't understand so I had to explain
I said look our size is the same
But I'm way cuter it was easier to scoop her
Now she's gone
Chante moore's on the phone
Now Kenny Lattimore cries all alone
Brad Pitt started a fight club again
Cause me and Jennifer Aniston real close friends
J.lo I don't know
I don't wanna go where everybody been
Affleck who's next
Forget your chain I snatch your chick from your neck
Eric Benet, Banet be not
You the x-man I'm all that Halle's got
Type of man that Tamia deserves
So you can keep grant on the injured reserve
I got dreams of bagging a hollywood chick
I'm just saying, no I'm ain't playing
Dreams of bagging a hollywood chick

[Verse Two: Bow Wow]
As I sit back, relax get my hair corn-rolled
Thinking 'bout the little honey's that I wanna know
Raven Symone kinda grown holla back
I wanna go one on one with Kyla Pratt
Picture that, what would her moms say
Kiss Solange and turn her into Beyonc√©
Cause I'm a mack no trivia to that
Nivea cleaning my throwbacks in laundrymats
And I'm a g her, yeah, every time I see her
Squeeze 3LW up into my 2 seater (eh)
Christina Milian is the bomb as she move her body like a snake ma (oh)
Jennifer Freeman got kicked from the crib
She was talking 'bout some wife and
Kids
Meagan Good if I could then I would
You say I won't but I really think I
Should
Show my rims to the Olsen Twins
Yo they looked at each other and they both got thin
Cause I'm a pimp
I feed 'em lobster and shrimp
Well you know it's just a rhyme I don't mean no offence
