[J.D]
Ye ain't ridin (ye ain't ridin)
Ye ain't bumpin like I'm bumpin
Ye ain't sayin nuthin homie
Ye ain't fresh azimiz
Ye ain't got it (ye ain't got it)
You don't keep it thuggin like I keep it thuggin
Lil buddy you ain't fresh azimiz

[J-Kwon]
Ye ain't big (big) whippin
Ye ain't steady tip tippin
No girl gettin homie
You ain't fresh azimiz
Think ye iz (think ye iz)
But cha ain't (but cha ain't)
Think you can get it crunk like me but you can't

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
When I was 8 I was rhymin not back yard game playin
Watchin Snoop anxiously and waitin for my chance man
Hot and cocky wit it cause I kno that I am man
I'm goin down in history like American Band stand
I stay fresh to def like the neighborhood dope man
I stay on the top cause I keep comin wit dough man
You steady watchin stealin but there ain't no hope man
You dealin wit somethin bigger than the US oh man
And ain't no jokin
Fresh like fatlaces and dukey ropes and I keep on smokin
Young but I'm ready so that means I'm strokin
Look at me now days girl a dawg is pokin
Addicted to it J.D. say I got it bad
18 nigga makin more than yo dad see
They think they doin it but I'mma out do 'em
If you kno somebody like that pull up and say to 'em

[Verse 2: Mike Jones]
Ice Age in the buildin'
Mike Jones! Who? Mike Jones (Mike Jones)

A lot of people said I couldn't do this, I couldn't do that
So I came back with a platinum plat, now Ice Age is on the map
Stackin' stacks, flippin' 'llacs, everything I roll black-on-black
First album sold over a mill', second album gon' double that
Ice Age we in the place, puttin' diamonds all in they face
Platinum plus and seven months, in other words I'm livin' great
I stay flossin' that candy paint, stay sippin' that purple drank
Stay grippin' that woodgrain, can't help it, it's a Texas thing
Ghea, you know like Bun B, I gotta keep it trill
I told Johnny, Paul Wall want that ice in his grill
Ghea, you know like Bun B, I gotta keep it trill
I told Johnny, Paul Wall want that ice in his grill
Ghea, before I go, I gotta say one thing
April 18th, "The American Dream," (Mike Jones, Mike Jones)
Before I go, I gotta say one thing
April 18th, "The American Dream" (holla at me)

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
I got a spot in MIA to get away from the cold weather
Talk around town as if I'm wit Ciara
Bow fall off nigga that'll be never
I'm rich (yea I'm rich) I can do whatever
I get a kick outta shuttin suckas down in the parkin lot
Especially when they tryin to stunt thinking they hot
All out the window talking loud like they runnin my block
That's when I come through (come through) and all that stop
And ain't another younger keep it fresh like dis man
Every year, same time come wit them hits man
Tired of makin girls fall out wit a kiss man
Well listen and you're stuck music just like quick sand
Older people say that lil young dude sick man
Young A.I. and we cru thick man
Difference between me and you is you be bricklin
And I ain't never ever done that before (no)
