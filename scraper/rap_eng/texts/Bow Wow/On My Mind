[feat. Kid Ink]

[Verse 1:]
Girl I can't lie, it's bum as fuck
And like you huck truck I watch her back it up
She do that thing with her tongue, that's what's up (I love it)
Then roll a blunt right after we fuck (keep low)
Poppin molly, it's bout to get crazy
Girl stand back and catch these babies (watch out)
I'm getting impatient, girl I'm feeling anxious
She say she don't fuck on a first night basis

[Hook:]
I got pussy on my mind, aye that's all I do
You know I want you
I think about yo pussy all the time
That's every day
Aha, I thought I saw a puttycat
Pussy on my mind
I did, I did, I did
Swear I got that pussy on my mind
And I can't stop thinkin bout it
You know I got that pussy on my mind

[Verse 2:]
I think I'm dreamin
'Cause you look like that girl I met last weekend
Shorty bad (she bad)
Yea she fine (yea she fine)
Hit it from the back, know she feel it in her spine
'Cause I be fienin for er, I be missin it
Put it in my face, can I have a lick?
Can I have a lick? Can I have a lick? (yea)
Can I? Can can can I have a lick?

[Hook:]
I got pussy on my mind, aye that's all I do
You know I want you
I think about yo pussy all the time
That's every day
Aha, I thought I saw a puttycat
Pussy on my mind
I did, I did, I did
Swear I got that pussy on my mind
And I can't stop thinkin bout it
You know I got that pussy on my mind

[Bridge:]
Always on my mind, always on my mind
Not a day go by when it ain't on my mind
Always on my mind, always on my mind
Not a day go by when it ain't on my mind

[Hook:]
I got pussy on my mind, aye that's all I do
You know I want you
I think about yo pussy all the time
That's every day
Aha, I thought I saw a puttycat
Pussy on my mind
I did, I did, I did
Swear I got that pussy on my mind
And I can't stop thinkin bout it
You know I got that pussy on my mind
