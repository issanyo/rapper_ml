[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
I know you heard my reputation (reputation)
You dont think I would ever do right by you (by you)
You think that if you and I was in a relationship
I would never be true (be true)
You think that anything I say is straight gang (straight gang)
And to me your just another new name (new name)
But what im tryna tell you for every man
Theres a woman that'll make him change (him change)
And I believe you the one that'll make me (make me)
But any time I try to show you you shake me (shake me)
I know I make it real hard for you to take me serious
But baby girl I am (I am)
And I ain't stoppin right here, I'mma keep going
And im gonna make sure everyday that you keep knowing
Whether if I have to send you flowers
Or talk to you on the celle-phone for few hours
Im yellin like..

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
(One, one, one, one)
One minute you act like you like me (like me)
And then the next you don't (don't)
You still sending me crazy emails
Like I know its just sex you want (you want)
I can't lie the sex is truly incredible (incredible)
And every part of your body is so edible (edible)
I get tears from just thinking bout it
But that ain't the reason why im stuck and can't let you go (let you go)
We got a serious serious bond (bond)
And when we kick it we have nothin but fun (but fun)
I feel a whole lot of L-O-V-E between you and me
Even though we still young (young)
Just your company ain't gota get none
Talk the same lingo, understand where im coming from (coming from)
And if anybody ask me a question about you

Baby that sexual infectual
But still I choose you to be
With me and we're gonna
So you better not break it up
