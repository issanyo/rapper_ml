[Intro: Bow Wow]
I usually don't do this... well not all the time
But for you...
Prince of the O-Town
She know its finna go down
Prince of the O-Town
You know its finna go down

[Hook: Omarion] + (Bow Wow)
She's said that (she said)
She didn't want to be just another girl (look, I said)
I don't want to go but she's leading me (let's go)
Baby I ain't feeling just another girl
You're the only girl

[Bow Wow]
You know my swag soon as I walk in (fresh)
You saw one flash I was so sparklin (click)
When I walk past here they go talkin (haha)
They want me I do not want them (nope)
Ma I seen you since you stepped in (damn)
Such a princess need to be with a princeton (me)
I'm so turned on by your body dimension
Help me out O maybe you can convince her

[Omarion]
You got your mind set, girl you the finest
Its perfect timing; I just want to grind and...

[Hook]

[Bow Wow]
Lil mama... lemme holla at ya...
I spent all night baby tryna impress ya
What I got to do to let you know that you special
I don't want to make it seem its just sexual
But I really really want to undress you
Don't you worry about what the rest do
Yup a couple try to pull me to the restroom
So hurry hurry hurry come to the rescue
Cause your the only one I want to be next to

[Omarion]
I had her mind set, since our eyes met
Girl you so fine yes; want to get inside ya

[Hook]

[Bow Wow] + (Omarion)
(So come on girl~!) You should be in my drop
In fact you should be on top
(If you don't I'll) And if ya don't I'll
Be so lonely girl
Look, I probably leave the club alone
But I want to take you home
Ain't no other girls in here I say
(GIRL I ONLY WANT YOU~!)

[Hook]

[Omarion]
So come on girl
If you don't... I'll be lonely (said I'll be lonely)
Oh I need... someone to hold (can I hold you?)
GIRL I ONLY WANT YOU~!
