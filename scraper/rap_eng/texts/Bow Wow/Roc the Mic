(JD)
Uhhhhh
Uhhhhh
Uhhhhh

(JD)[Verse 1]
Since day one when he came up
I taught him everything and how to tear the game up,(Meeee)
What we went thru was a shame but
We back at it now, doing all the same stuff.(uh huh)
Being us

(Bow Wow)
When I left I heard all the words and the lil birds in the background
Saying how he gon act now? (uh huh)
Be stubborn lil homie couldn't back down, but im back now
And we back around

(JD)
Killin all the daughters and they mama long with em (yeaah)
Lil Homie so crazy and he stay tryna split em,(yeaah)
Stay with his shirt off, gang of tattoos
All the homies like nigga he act just like you

(Bow Wow)
Jay and its true, I do and I ain't even gonna front
Tryna hit it out the park while these other niggas bluff
Roll up like a blunt, straight stuntin on these niggas
Like you and jay did when I was just a kid

(Chorus)(x2)
They say we talk just alike
Walk just alike
Same damn swagger
When we Roc up on the Mic
All the girls like
He can get it
All my niggas hands up
Lemme know that you wit it

(Bow Wow) [Verse 2]
Come on now that Obama no drama all about the doe,(okay)
In with the new, (and) out with the old
Stay making it, keepin the people wantin mo'
And for L-I-F-E, W-E So-So

(JD)
So cold like a winter night in Chi-Town,(yea)
You Know,(yea) you ain't hot homie pipe down
See the label done got a nigga hype
Stop running around, lying bout your motherfuckin life clown

(Bow Wow)
The real dont do that
I be lookin at em like EWWW who do that?
Kids dont feel that
But you wouldn't know
Cuz you getting too old and slow
Said he poppin when u barely goin gold nigga,(whoaa)

(JD)
Same Lambo, Same Bent Different color
More Like my lil son and just my lil brother
See I had to let him go

Just so he can really know
You never know what you got
Until its gone
Welcome Home

(Chorus) (x2)
They say we talk just alike
Walk just alike
Same damn swagger
When we Roc up on the Mic
All the girls like
He can get it
All my niggas hands up
Lemme know that you wit it

(JD)[Verse 3]
Bow holla at em

(Bow Wow)
Okay, Same Lambo, Same Bent different color
More than like a dad and just a big brother
We ain't always gonna agree
Eye to Eye
But for him Im straight Do or Die, I...

(JD)
Couldn't of said it better cuz I feel the same
Its just somethings that ain't never suppose to change
Like when Nicky Barnes switched the name of the blue magic
For no reason and fucked up a good package

(Bow Wow)
You dont get a ring, unless you got a team
My niggas round you that'll hold you down
Run with you around thru the thick and the thin
When the work ain't comin in
You know the ups and the downs
That we all go thru Jay

(JD)
You See the moral of the story is
We let the biz come thru and seperate this
Dis been one of the realest and the greatest
Relationships between 2 friends
Im talkin true friends

(Chorus)(x2)
They say we talk just alike
Walk just alike
Same damn swagger
When we Roc up on the Mic
All the girls like
He can get it
All my niggas hands up
Lemme know that you wit it

(Bow Wow talks..)
