[Intro: Bow Wow]
I'm off the chains
I'm off the chains
Yeah, I'm off the chains

[Chorus: Bow Wow]
Have you ever seen me? I'm the future
I represent how it's gon' be, I'm the future
Born in 1987, I'm the future
Party people get ready, it's the future
I don't know about y'all
But I know about me
And when I think about the future
I'm all you see
'Cause I am the future

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
I'm something you're not, I'm just right with the block
Every jam that I make, gotta go knock, knock
The biggest thing since Hugo
You know y'all cats do a whole lot do mo'
Believe me, I'm loose now running at full speed
Like the juice now like back in '73
Ya heard of me? Had to, I'm that lil' bad dude
Running around cutting it down with JD
I'm the A in the hit, I'm the prince of the clique
What you think keep making shorty have them fits?
It's the B capital O-W Wow
Like Moe Dee, how you like me now?
Trying to do it real big like Chris and them
But if this thing don't work I'm above the rim
Between the legs and behind the back
Yeah I'm small but I got that
Now tell me

[Chorus: Bow Wow]
Have you ever seen me? I'm the future
I represent how it's gon' be, I'm the future
Born in 1987, I'm the future
Party people get ready, it's the future
I don't know about y'all
But I know about me
And when I think about the future
I'm all you see
'Cause I am the future

[Verse 2: The R.O.C.]
Now look up ahead that's me
Far beyond the flow is gone come on
You know the kid is crazy like Britney Spears
And I'm in the prime of my years
Oh yeah, I know what pops up in your head first is (wait a minute)
How he keep coming up with verses
Well I'm gonna tell you something and don't get nervous
My secret is I'm doing this on purpose (why?)
To get a billion copies purchased, and if your style's sick
Mine's must be allergic
My rhymes in the beat merges like interstate traffic
It's just a habit I flows it
I know it'll probably illegal before the o's before you
Even close to being the COR
Even backwards I'm hard and I give my regards
But I ain't rapping with y'all, I'm a year after tomorrow

[Chorus: The R.O.C.]
You can't see me, I'm the future
I represent how it's gone be, I'm the future
Born in '79, I'm the future
Party people get ready, it's the future
