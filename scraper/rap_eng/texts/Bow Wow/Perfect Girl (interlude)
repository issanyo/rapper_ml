My perfect dream girl, she have to be nice
Uh...I mean she have to be real nice
She gon have to be real fly
She gon have to be jiggy
She gon have to be up-to-date
You know what I'm sayin'
That's how I'm gon want my girl to be

Ima want my girl to respect me for who I am
I want her to look real pretty you know what I'm sayin'
Not Not real uh...sedity like you know what I'm sayin'
Not real prissy
I want her to be able to ride with me for me to be able to ride with her
You know, maybe if she like that I can take her out to the movies sometime
Hit the Cheesecake Factory you know;
Have a couple of roses sent to her you know so when she get out of school

They'll be right there on the front porch you know
That's the type of stuff I like doing
And maybe on the weekend on a Friday or Saturday you know um...maybe we could
Go party
