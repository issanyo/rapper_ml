[Intro]
I’m trying to tell you young bloods
Listen here
You don’t know everything
You can’t know everything
Ay

[Hook]
Man its all I know
Man its all I know
Man its all I know
Man its all I know
Man its all I know
Man its all I know
This the life I live and i can’t run from

[Verse 1]
Can’t trust these niggas plus Puff said “fuck these niggas”
Got my mind on my money, tryna get the bricks truckload my nigga
It’s the life I chose so I’m living it, money coming in and we spending it
Straight off the lot, we ain’t renting shit
I’m up all night, I’m in the streets, I run the clubs
Ask around they know what’s up
I made a million at thirteen , living out this dream
Just the other day, had a chick speak to Chris
Told him that “you work too hard, don’t lose it all to some bitch”
My daughter good, my homie straight, what more could I want?
Know rappers who done lost it all, but that’s something I won't (do)
Can’t teach a nigga that know the game, I ain’t here dog for no reasons
Talkin’ about doing shows for no money, now in the conversation we [?]

[Pre-Hook]
Now they telling me, all this weed I smoke, it ain’t good for me
All this money that I’m seeing, it ain’t good for me
All these bitches I be with, it ain’t good for me
But it’s the life I live and i can’t run from it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Asking why I smoke ‘cause it eases my stress
Got to explain to my daughter that I’m not at home ‘cause I’m out getting checks
And you know I’m gon’ flex, you know I’m gon’ flex
Pull up in that new shit, skrit, skrit
With a mili on my wrist, and a million dollar bitch
Who do it like this? Nobody nigga, why I’m so cocky my nigga
It’s my persona, no amount of dollars can buy you this swagger my nigga
It’s a new me, it’s a new day, still get in the pad like Cool J
Like how he was back in ‘88, had to get it straight
Why hate on me when you can learn, let me demonstrate
Don’t know what’s wrong with this new era  ‘cause nowadays niggas love to hate
I’m just living my life, nigga let me be great
Niggas tryna keep up, but we ain’t in the same race

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]
