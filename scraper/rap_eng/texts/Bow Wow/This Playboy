[Intro: Lil' Bow Wow]
Oh
Playboy
Uh ha, yeah
Uh ha, oh
My name is Bow Wow, check me out now

[Verse 1: The R.O.C.]
Uh-ohh, you then crossed the line
Beware of the dog is right there on the sign
You gotta muscle now, get 'em up and um
Put 'em up don't drop 'em
To the ceiling let, me see you get crunk bounce
Uh, it will never be another one
With his style he' pound oh bow wow
From the eighteenth letter
And this Playboy representin' it forever
Can't no body do it better?
Never, when-ever, where-ever, who-ever
However who-ever touch you'll never breathe again ever
So whatever
I'ma pass the mic down to the B-O-W W-O-W you
You in trouble

[Verse 2: Lil' Bow Wow]
Uh, ain't nothing like a young cat with his mind right
And a lime like chasing a dream
At the same time making some cream
Nickname 'Scary', 'cause I know how to make 'em scream
(Is that right?) Every time I'm seen, I'm full of flash
Every time I'm out pockets full of cash
And about my crew ain't no need to ask
We steady, steady keep puttin' down a smash
I was a thing thing before I became a teen
I know that market folds instead of cones of ice cream
And that's why I don't care who you are
When it come to the beat you gotta raise the bar becauseâ€¦

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri]
This playboy, he gets crunk
Keep that bang off in the truck
With a nick-nac-paddy-whack, throw me a bone
And this playboy gon' bring it ya heard me
This playboy, he gets crunk
Keep that bang off in the truck
With a nick-nac-paddy-whack, throw me a bone
And this playboy gon' bring it ya heard me

[Verse 3: Big Duke]
Uh ha, yes sir
Now think 'bout the lock down these holds southeast
Pull cards like teeth, lang names like a reef
I wish one of you bustas would spark some beef
I swear to God it's gon' be hard for your mom to sleep
See when I fall up in the club haters still show me love
With dap, cheese and hugs, that's the life of a thug
I walk it like I talk it, toke it 'cause I spark it
Straight take you suckers boy ice and go and holk it
I'm on the patio blowin' cleanin' my gun
While Bow Wow in the front shootin' hoops with my son
Big Duke be representin' for the hole Eastside
J.D. made me lieutenant, now watch how we ride

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri]
This playboy (playboy), he gets crunk
Uhh ha, keep that bang off in the truck (bounce)
With a nick-nac-paddy-whack, throw me a bone (bone, bone, bone)
And this playboy gon' bring it ya heard me
This playboy (playboy), he gets crunk
Uh ha, uh ha uh ha (get it crunk), keep that bang off in the truck
(Uh ha, uh ha, yeah, bounce shorty bounce, bounce shorty bounce)
With a nick-nac-paddy-whack, throw me a bone (bone, bone, bone)
And this playboy gon' bring it ya heard me (ooh bounce shorty, bounce uh ha)

[Verse 4: Lil' Bow Wow]
I'm tryin' to have yall wait to see what I sell
And a block full screamin' up at TRL
Another thing I want y'all niggas to know
I ain't one of them lil cats that's gon' come and go
I got somethin' to show and ah, somethin' to say
And knockin' down anything in my way
I don't want haft a plate I want the whole thing
I'm tryin' to escort Aaliyah or somebody on Soul Train
If you so free, I'm tryin' to do five
And be the first kid, on the cover of VIBE
So if you at number one, you better save a that
'Cause once I get it, it ain't never comin' back, for sho

[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri]
This playboy (playboy), he gets crunk (uh ha)
(Uh ha, uh ha oh) Keep that bang off in the truck (oh oh yeah)
(Uh ha, uh ha) With a nick-nac-paddy-whack, throw me a bone
(Uh ha, uh ha, uh ha, yeah, let me touch it let me touch it)
And this playboy gon' bring it ya heard me
This playboy (uh ha, uh ha), he gets crunk
(Get it crunk shorty, get it crunk shorty)
Keep that bang off in the truck
(Uh ha, uh ha, uh ha, uh ha, uh ha)
With a nick-nac-paddy-whack, throw me a bone
(Throw it to me baby, throw it to me baby, uh ha, uh ha)
