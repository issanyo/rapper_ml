So, so def, uh, uh
All I know
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
When I'm with you
(My lil' homie, my roll dog)
You make me feel so good
You know you do
(You know it's the)
Way you walk
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
And the way you talk
(The way you talk to me, girl)
You know you look so good
Make me forget about all I know
I been looking for you girl for a minute now
The way you look and how you puts it down
See this dog just don't fall easy
You gotta be off the heezy for sheezy
And make young weezy wanna get with it
(Ha, ha)
And lock down all your digits
Talk to you for hours at a time
About whatever comes across your mind
When we out, girls run up, you don't even trip
You get a kick out of watching them flip
I wanna live for you slim, I never been like this
But it's cool 'cause I like this
Got you a 2-way so you don't miss a beat
For the times that I'm working and I cannot speak
All the the homies tease me say you got me sprung
But they just mad 'cause they ain't got one, I'm saying
All I know
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
When I'm with you
(My lil' homie, my roll dog)
You make me feel so good
You know you do
(You know it's the)
Way you walk
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
And the way you talk
(The way you talk to me, girl)
You know you look so good
Make me forget about all I know
My lil homie, my roll dog, we really kill em'
When we step through the mall looking just alike
Both got cornrows, two bags each
Both so fresh from our head to our feet
Only disagree when we talk ball play
I say I.V you say M.J
You say you with me, that's where you mistaken
I ain't Omar Epps and you ain't Sanna Lattan
I do you, let's find another subject
A girl that really understands, you gotta love that
A young Sergio Valente, Louie Vatine
Shell top rocking and likes to have fun
Fresher than the next chick
No need for you to ever sweat the next chick
Indeed, I make the next the chick, see the exit with speed
'Cause your the only thing that I need, I'm saying
All I know
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
When I'm with you
(My lil' homie, my roll dog)
You make me feel so good
You know you do
(You know it's the)
Way you walk
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
And the way you talk
(The way you talk to me, girl)
You know you look so good
Make me forget about all I know
Shorty, do you really, really love me?
Shorty, do you really, really care?
Shorty, do you really, really need me?
'Cause if you do I'm a be right here
Shorty, do you really, really love me?
Shorty, do you really, really care?
Shorty, do you really, really need me?
'Cause if so, I'm a be right here
All I know
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
When I'm with you
(My lil' homie, my roll dog)
You make me feel so good
You know you do
(You know it's the)
Way you walk
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
And the way you talk
(The way you talk to me, girl)
You know you look so good
Make me forget about all I know
