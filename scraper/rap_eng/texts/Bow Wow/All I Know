J.D: So So Def Uh Uh

Chorus:Lil' Corey (LBW)

All I know (Uh Uh Uh Uh)
When I'm with you (my lil homie, my roll dog)
You make me feel so good
You know you do (you know it's the)
Way you walk (Uh Uh Uh Uh)
And the way you talk (the way you talk to me girl)
You know you look so good
Make me forget about
All I know

[Lil' Bow Wow]
I been looking for you girl for a minute now
The way you look and how you puts it down
See this dog just don't fall easy
You gotta be off the heezy for sheezy
And make young weezy wanna get with it (ha ha)
And lock down all your digits
Talk to you for hours at a time
About whatever comes across your mind
When we out, girls run up
You don't even trip
You get a kick out of watching them flip
I wanna live for you slim
I never been like this
But it's cool cause I like this
Got you a 2-way so you don't miss a beat
For the times that I'm working and I cannot speak
All the the homies tease me say you got me sprung
But they just mad cause they ain't got one
I'm saying

Chorus: Repeat 1x

[Lil' Bow Wow]
My lil homie, my roll dog
We really kill em' when we step through the mall looking just alike
Both got cornrows, two bags each,both so fresh from our head to our feet
Only disagree when we talk ball play
I say I.V you say M.J
You say you with me, thats where you mistaken
I ain't Omar Epps and you ain't Sanaa Lathan
I do you, lets find another subject
A girl that really understands
You gotta love that
A young Sergio Valente, Louie Vuitton
Shell top rocking and likes to have fun
Fresher than the next chick
No need for you to ever sweat the next chick
Indeed
I make the next the chick see the exit with speed
Cause your the only thing that I need
I'm saying

Chorus: Repeat 1x

[Lil' Bow Wow]
Shorty, do you really really love me
Shorty, do you really really care
Shorty, do you really really need me
Cause if you do I'm a be right here
Shorty, do you really really love me
Shorty, do you really really care
Shorty, do you really really need me
Cause if so, I'm a be right here

Chorus 1x
