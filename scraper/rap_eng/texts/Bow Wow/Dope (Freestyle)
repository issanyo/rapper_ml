So LeBron in this rap shit
She suck me off so long I rubbed off her chap stick
Still stunting on weak niggas like so what
Touch down in New York, I’m fuckin with slope bust
Find me flying down the Westside in that S5
Fuck with bad bitches, from Queens to Bed Stuy
Neck piece still on freeze mode
Been hot since Sega Genesis, dookie ropes and cangos
I still act a fool with the cash, put the bitch on blast
Has the backs and know she let me smash
And I ain’t have to give her a penny
See I just gave her some remi, next thing you know
I’m getting head in my Bentley
Bt chess got me livin right
I’m bout to cop a new crib and a 9 figure digit price
Man the boy dangerous like too much Codeine
I get on tracks, I spaz, no, I OD

Niggas don’t know me
I keep extra niggas for safety
That’s for them fuck boys out there tryna play me
These jays ain’t out yet, you can’t find em
I dawn like mobsters, getting 4 cheese pastas
And I don’t like these boys out here
I don't rock tight pants that look weird, I dye my hair
I’m a motherfucking nigga from the O H I O
Niggas come broke out here like T O
Bow's money straight like starch yeah
Saying I’m broke is like trying to say dogs don’t bark
That ain’t happenin, no time soon
Pull up in that 911 crush they move, cause I’m that dude
Ask your bitch,she was texting you
She was sucking my dick
Yeah, she multi-talented, smokin that Cali shit
I smoke one down and then I roll me another spliff
