They see me lookin' good, they sayin' I done changed
And I'm never on the block no more
But I'm still the same so that's not the case
I'm busy getting money on tour

And I put that on my hood, hood, hood
Man, I put that on my hood, hood, hood
I'm the same man

Your boy doin' numbers, I do it for Columbus
I put my city on the map now go locate a compass
They sayin' I done changed, attitude ain't the same
I guess this the negative effects that money bring

I'm still the same Shad from Buck-town
Ain't nothin' changed but the label, I'm reppin' Cash Money now
Got love for the hood, I'm still giving back
And some still hate, well, boy, I'm used to that

Uh, and I got my mom a bigger house
Do it for the people, they the only ones I care about
Instead they make me out to be something that I'm not
Sayin' I only care about ho's and cash stacks

They see me lookin' good, they sayin' I done changed
And I'm never on the block no more
But I'm still the same so that's not the case
I'm busy getting money on tour

And I put that on my hood, hood, hood
Man, I put that on my hood, hood, hood
I'm the same man

Through the recession I was helping people through the drought
This is for my niggas who was locked up and ain't gettin' out
And Bart came home, no more Fed time
While he was locked up I made sure that his daughter fine

Yeah, now that's real nigga shit
Got people registered to vote, now how much realer do it get?
And I love givin' back, puttin' smiles on kid's faces
Payin' off tuitions, makin' sure they get a education

It ain't nothin', I will never turn my back on y'all
We used to window-shop but now we tearin' down the mall
Now I'm put in a position to help and make a difference
I know I mess up sometimes so I ask God for forgiveness, let go

They see me lookin' good, they sayin' I done changed
And I'm never on the block no more
But I'm still the same so that's not the case
I'm busy getting money on tour

And I put that on my hood, hood, hood
Man, I put that on my hood, hood, hood
I'm the same man

Yeah, and I put that on my hood
Yeah, I say I put that on my
But y'all know I ain't changed, man
