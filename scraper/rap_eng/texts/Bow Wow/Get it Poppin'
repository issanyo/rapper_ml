(*dogs barking*)

[Swizz Beatz - talking]
One two, one two
Bow Weezy, Swizz Weazy (yo, yo, yo)
(WOO! WOO! WOO!)
Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies to the flo' (stand up)
The fellas to the flo'
As we go a little somethin like this

WOO! WOO! WOO! WOO! (yo, yo, yo)
(yo, yo, yo, yo, yo) WOO! WOO! WOO!
C'mon

[Chorus - Swizz Beatz] - 2X
Let's get it poppin (c'mon)
Let's get it jumpin (c'mon)
Let's get it poppin (c'mon)
Let, let's get it jumpin (c'mon)

[Verse 1 - Bow Wow]
Listen take a few minutes to mellow out (WOO)
The name's Weezy girls, I wanna tell about (OW)
How I have them yellin at the top of they lungs and
Let's get it poppin, let, let's get it jumpin
Ain't nothin to the young dog, run yard
Charts lock, soon as I bark, I'm amongst top
B-Wizzle, Swizzle
Is you crazy baby, I'm rainin, them boys just drizzle
No more tryin to "be Like Mike"
Cause even Mike Jordan's two boys wanna be like I
All I ever hear when the girls go by is
"Why am I so fly?"
I don't know, but uh 

[Chorus]

[Break - Bow Wow] - w/ ad libs
I go by the name of Bow Weezy and
All the other little homies be easy and
I gotta do my thing to get the cheese again
You can't see me you better believe me man (talk to 'em)

[Verse 2 - Bow Wow]
Now I'm back for ya, to the Swizz track for ya (uh huh)
Want to get it jumpin, and I can gets that for ya (uh huh)
It's me, please, wouldn't believe (uh)
The ease that I run through them sucker MC's (WOO)
B-Dub like fist to gloves, I fix snubs
That Swizz done mixes like drugs
So watch the club's get high-yi-ya (OW)
Feel like Cali when I drop by (UH)
Why bodies droppin, all the mommies faintin
Watch the candy paint change (OH), gangsta ain't it? (HEY)
Anxious to hot, they anus in the drop, get acquainted
With the hottest in entertainment (C'mon)

[Chorus]

[Break]

[Verse 3 - Bow Wow]
I can't lie, I love b-o-o-t-y (spell it out, why?)
Cause I never let it walk on by
When I see it in them Shago jeans
Crazy how baby legs bustin from the seam
Like uh, uh, UH, all over the track
Told her (uh) "pardon me, (uh) get up in the 'lac"
Just, sit inside the Denelli and relax
She was Mitchell and Ness, the way she threw it back like UH (WOO)
Why must I chase the cat, as I blaze the track
The snare, the high hat
The baseline is mine, the modern time canine phenom
Now ya'll sing it line from line, now c'mon

[Chorus]

[Break]

[Swizz Beatz - talking]
Okay, one two, one two, one two, one two
One two, one two, one two, one two, one two, one two
You just heard the sounds of Bow Wizzle, Swizz Beatz
It's serious man, ah, just a lean
Your a grown man dog, C'MON
