[Break - Bow Wow]
West coast why don't ya'll just wa-walk with me
East coast just Harlem shake sh-shake with me
Midwest just chickenhead - the head with me
Dirty South just b-b-bounce b-bounce with me

[Chorus - Bow Wow]
I'm b-a-c-k (OH)
I'm b-a-c-k (OH)
I'm b-a-c-k (OH)
(*scratch noise*) (Bow, Bow, Bow Wow)
I'm b-a-c-k

[Verse 1 - Bow Wow]
Me fall off? dog you can't be ser-ious
Cause I've been doin this since I was in baby dia-pers
All my life this talent been pumpin in my veins
I know these girls is happy that I'm back in the game
While I was gone the question was "when ya album come out?"
Another one to go cop so ya'll could scream and shout
Been away for a minute, negotiatin some deals
Discussin some business on how I can make mils
Man it feels good to know that ya fans love ya
I've been flyin back and forth just meetin with Warner Brothers
You know, sitcoms is gonna be on your TV's
So all the Bow Wow fans could see me on GP

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Bow Wow]
Every dog has his day, so right now be mine
I ain't no unpolished, I'm a polished diamond that shine
Had to retire my Mickey Mouse, I'd gotten too old
Peachfuzz on my lip, homeboy I'm grown
I'm that Eastside, East savin, 6-1-fo' reppin
Girl getter, playboy, the flow got better
Look at me on top, number one is my rank
I'm enjoyin sittin back, watchin ya'll MC's sink
Uh a huh, you see that Z? that's me inside
I blow chicks' minds, when they see me pushin the ride
I'm back and dog I ain't cuttin no slack
I'm back for my homie (yeah), ya heard that?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Bow Wow]
Oh, you want some advice? well without a doubt
Dog don't come out when Bow Wow's out
When I spit, my rhymes be as sharp as a dart
Another album that's fittin to shoot straight up the charts
Number one videos straight to "106"
Every suburban middle American gonna be bumpin this
See I'm real, don't worry I got it on lock
When the boy wonder's around, I shut down shop
Huh, rapper slash, actor slash
I cause total chaos, I got it in a smash
Homie ain't nobody hotter, told you that I'm back
And I'm goin back for the whole enchilada, you got it

[Chorus]

[Break]
