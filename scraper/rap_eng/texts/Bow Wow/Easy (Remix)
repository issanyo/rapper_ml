[Intro: Paula DeAnda & (Danja)]
Yeah!
(Yeah, Paula)
Ow!
(Danja!)

[Verse 1: Paula DeAnda]
I might be a young girl, but I know how to have fun
I got them boys chasing me, tryna make me the one
When I'm out shopping, it's like I'm having a gun
Whatever I wanna get, I got them boys caught up

[Pre-Chorus: Paula DeAnda]
I know I'm a hot, hot shorty
But you gotta slow down (slow down)
You don't know me (don't know me)
If you in a hot, hot hurry
Then you gotta go now (go now)
Back up off me (off me)
Uh-oh

[Chorus: Paula DeAnda]
Got them going crazy, you see (uh-oh)
Head over heels for me, oh  (uh-oh)
Weak in the knees for me, boy (uh-oh)
'Cause you were so damn easy
'Cause you were so damn easy (easy)
'Cause you were so damn easy (oh)

[Verse 2: Paula DeAnda]
I'm much wiser than you think, better act like you know (you know)
Just because I'm a teen, it don't mean that I'm slow
I think you're a cutie boy, but you're turning me off
Sometimes you gotta play hard to get and then it's on

[Pre-Chorus: Paula DeAnda]
I know I'm a hot, hot shorty
But you gotta slow down
You don't know me
If you in a hot, hot hurry
Then you gotta go now
Back up off me (off me)
Uh-oh

[Chorus: Paula DeAnda & {Bow Wow}]
Got them going crazy, you see (uh-oh)
Head over heels for me, oh  (uh-oh)
Weak in the knees for me, boy (uh-oh)
'Cause you were so damn easy {Fo sho'}
'Cause you were so damn easy {It's a money ain't a thing, J.R.}
'Cause you were so damn easy

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
I am Bow Weezy
Lil' mama, you so fine
What's it gonna take for you to be mine?
Now let me upgrade ya
Don't listen to your friends, they haters
And umm, them guys so lame
I'm way in biz, they not the same
I am, far from a beginner
Put some on your wrist, cold like winter
Pay no limit on the black cars
Anything you want, baby, it's yours
You now rollin' with the best, baby
Plus, I know how to treat you, lady
They call me the modern LL Cool J
All I do is write girl bills
Bow Weezy, hot like a sauna
Me and Paula
Now everybody on us
Holla back

[Chorus: Paula DeAnda]
Uh-oh
Got them going crazy, you see (uh-oh)
Head over heels for me, oh (uh-oh)
Weak in the knees for me, boy (uh-oh)
'Cause you were so damn easy
Uh-oh
Got them going crazy, you see (uh-oh)
Head over heels for me, oh (uh-oh)
Weak in the knees for me, boy (uh-oh)
'Cause you were so damn easy (no, no, no, no, no)

[Outro: Paula DeAnda]
Don't be so damn easy
Don't be so damn easy
