[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
Nothing else matters baby only you though
Your love got me so high I'm sittin' on Pluto
And she don't care about those [?] rumours that we're told
And I keep her by my side like my blueberry gold
Yea she the one you wife up the one you settle down with
Roll up switch [?] yea she a down chick
And she spend her nights at home and she in college
Up like sunny and sextin we cuddling
And she glad she with Me
Buy the whole store out for I got more bread then giffy
I'm a talking about all nighters baby girl no quickies
Watch I get you out them vickies

[Hook]
I was hopin you'd notice
The way that I like to
Have you around (Around yeah)
I can't see no one else
It's you by yourself, yea
In spite of the crowd
(Baby no one else matters)

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
Stay by my side Its all love when we be alone
Pretty face, nice shape like nia long
My better half a lot of things we agreeing on
And other women holla at me but I lead them on
And like a hot song you got the right features
And go shoppin, don't worry about the price neither
Hot diva, walkin round in my wife beater
Them other bitches luke warm like a light fever
And you the one you ain't nothing like them price skeezers
And I ain't Michael Jackson but I treat it like beat it
Legs shakin while you bitin on a pillow, now you wet like a drizzle i get right up in the middle
I, treat it good yea i treat it like it should be
If I ain't have it baby, lost is what i would be
You the silent type, center fold model type
Ba-Baby momma type
I'm here to tell ya that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ya Boy]
She got true religious on
But not for long... no
Me and baby making bedroom into a porno
Usually a guy like me four more
But I had to tone it down a little cause you so fly
Real talk why would I lie?
Plus your juciebox get me superman high
Where you at for the night
Tell your boyfriend you gonna for the night
I'll be back if it's tight
Hop on it right like the passenger side... in my car
You ever made love to a star?
I make it hot she in love and that's a [? ]
I'm pushing her buttons she like my blackberry
I had to add her to my BPM
She heard about them black card boys we be them
I rep black card music BCM
They call me the rockstar can we be friends?
