I'm flashy, I'm fly
So fly, I'm about to take off
Now O is the R and B

Tonight we about to Face Off
Now watch as I drop that top on the Aston Mar
Few shots then we left the bar
Anything she's asking for
I'll make it appear like a magic wand
I got the antidote
I got the stroke right and a pole
Gotta do it right on camera though
Bring another friend so my man can go
