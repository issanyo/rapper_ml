Cincinnati red hat, all I do is bowl out
Pop fly if you wanna f*ck around get drugs out
Cash money young money who f*ck it with us
All the other younger's I'm the motha f*cking illest
Ohio with me. but town in this b*tch pockets hella deep
F*ck around and drowning his b*tch
I only care for my daughter so I grind even harder
Star in my own movies and I'm not Martin Lawrence
I'm sitting on these niggas these boys ain't in my lane
Body on competition I don't' cross on my slamp
Hot socks and some vans
Telling my ain't plan
And my pig bank fine, I'mma bout to go HAM
Niggas still hating on me like I even really care
Got your girl in my whip she get me brain while I stare
I'm the hottest do doing it, don't let em tell you otherwise
Rap games garbage all these nigga do is lie

Chorus: I got em yeah
I got em yeah
Let em niggas know I'm the motha f*cka problem
Hey I got em yeah
I got em yeah
Let em niggas know I'm the motha f*cka problem

Lycris

Chrome on the truck like a hore you suck
Not missy eillot but tell em niggas past the Dutch
Drizzy put me on some hoes from the T dot
Y M C M B yeah nigga we hot
Only rock jordans nigga fuck reebock
You nigga tell mess up, like a broken down wrist watch
Real niggas do real nigga shit
Keep my bussiness till my son n' hoes and talkin about you quick
Rico turn that 5 D, on what you got me smokin' on damn, dog that weed strong
Really tho, they ain't' f*cking with the kid
They dont get it how I get it and live it how I live
What it is

Chorus: I got em yeah
I got em yeah
Let em niggas know I'm the motha f*cka problem
Hey I got em yeah
I got em yeah
Let em niggas know I'm the motha f*cka problem
