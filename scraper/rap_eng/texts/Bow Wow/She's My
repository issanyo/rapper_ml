[Intro: Bow Wow]
Uh huh
See I ain't afraid to let the whole world know
Know what I'm saying
You could call me Bow Wow
But tonight.. I'm Lamborghini Moss
Real special occasion you know?
And Pain
Lets go get 'em again homey

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
Lil' mama bad man, she fine
She a dime, she a problem
Bedroom time boy, I make her yell like the Khaled
So good, check her swag unlike anything I had
Red American Express get what you want, got every bag
Niggas mad, say I'm slipping
Her girls think she trippin'
We don’t even feed in to that Bull like Jordan and Pippen, don’t be trippin
When she here I'm at the club with other women
When I be out on tour she be the only thing I'm missin'
Late night she hit my Sidekick like "Bow come over"
Treat her like a fourth quarter
And put that D on her
She put up with all my bullshit and all of my drama and I know that she the one because I let her meet my mama

[Hook: T-Pain]
She’s my only love
She’s my
And when I'm gone girl I miss you can't nobody do me like you shawty [Bow Wow]
She’s my only love
She’s my only love
She’s my
She hold me down every body knows she model round town come on [Bow Wow]
She’s my only love
See that’s my girl I ain’t afraid to let the whole world know [Bow Wow]

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
Nigga trying to holla but she know they like
Can’t no other nigga do it like this mane
I done been wit a lot of girls in my lifetime
But this right here this the real thing
I spoil her, adore her
Give her cash to go to the mall-a
My ride or die, my down ass
Like destiny I'm her soldier
When she be feeling down I give her loving I mean all of it
She my lil' bust it baby like Ne-Yo and Plies and them
Look good when she walking round my crib in them boy shorts Wife B
And when I lick that spot see she get real moist
Catered food on a jet
Me and her be taking trips
Passport full of stamps
Been to every continent
She all mine, she so fine
And girls like this so hard to find
That’s why I knew
First day I saw, shit I had to make her mine

[Hook: x2]
