JD: People from everywhere gather around
Checkin' out the sound, that we keep throwin' down
We keeps it crunk like this every day
Young Wezzy what you gotta say
Bow:A miracle model Creation
Bowwow on the set hyped up with the basics

A little of what ya love
From a brotha who's smooth like a criminal
I need some flimminal
Otherwise known as a villan
Because I'm ruthless
I'm the best out and I'm killin' em
The best that think they got to deal wit me
It's obviouse, Tell em' who you came to see
(bowwow)Repeat
