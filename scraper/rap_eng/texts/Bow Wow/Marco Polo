[Intro: Soulja Boy] + (Bow Wow)
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em
(And da boy Bow Wow in da building)
My swag too official man
(Ay, Soulja my swag too) y'all can't catch up
(Ayo, Bow let em' know how you lookin though)
(OWWW~!)

[Hook One: Bow Wow]
New G Shock (check), yellow Lamborghini (Bow)
BC shirt with a fresh pair of jeans (Wow)
Black cards, spendin' when I hit the mall (stuntin'!)
Can't catch me, I'm so ahead of y'all
Marco Polo {*4X*}
Marco Polo {*8X*}

[Bow Wow]
(Get 'em Bow!)
Ay, took my car to the mall, then I blacked out
Now my closet's full of J's like a crack house
Ceiling so high! You would think it was Shaq's house
Whip so big, that it beep when I back out
Like (BEEP, BEEP) ayo, tell that nigga move
It's Bow weezy, Mr. Get 'em wetter than a pool
I step up in the room, bunch of ice where my chain be
All the bad bitches just be screaming like they angry
Some call me cocky, but how could ya blame me?
And all the hoes like me because my money lengthy!
(Yeahhhh) and I'm still the first to rock
(Yeahhhh) first to put ice in a G Shock; she like my...

[Hook One]

[Soulja Boy]
Never been fake cause all the girls love official
S.O.D. cause girls love initials!
I'm on another level, I'm in my zone
Black car, white rims - can they both get along?
This is not The Matrix, but I am the oracle
Do you wanna get with me? The question is rhetoricle
Say the same lines but the fans aren't bored of me
75,000 dollars if you want to order me
Hold on!! Let me change my swag
My flow broadband, y'all boys still LAN
My whole clique straight, y'all whole click fags
Last night your girl's forehead was on my abs

[Hook Two: Soulja Boy]
Gucci Bandana (check), Louie V leather
Keep on looking, there's no one better
Air force ones, mix with the new J's (check)
Can't catch me, I'm too far away!
Marco Polo {*4X*}
Marco Polo {*8X*}

[Bow Wow]
Bow makes the girls go crazy - they wanna be my lady
How many can I fit in my 2-seater Mercedes?
Lime green lambo, no roof, that's a drop top
Stop they hating, cause they girlfriend's on my jock
I let her lick the rapper, let her lick the actor
The next Will Smith and be ballin' like the Raptors
If you don't want no drama in the club then don't act up!
How can I run out? My money's longer than a tour bus!

[Hook One]

[Outro: Bow Wow]

Ay call me on my celluar now, Bow Wow
