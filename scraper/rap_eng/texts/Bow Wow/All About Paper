With a bad bitch pourin' lean I'm plugged with that doctor
Yeah I'm the trendin' topic, helicopter chopper
Hoppin' out the coupe with the juggs, god-damn, I'm awesome
Blowin' up my iPhone, lean in my styrofoam
50 bands for a show when Lil Soulja on the road
Jewelry on me so cold, I came up from the bando
Kickin' in niggas doors, now I'm whole team froze
I'm sittin' on a jet and I'm countin' up
Lotta money on me I just piled up
Shoutout to my shooter, they ain't playin' no games
Pullin' up on they block and we blowin' out they brains

Pass forgiatos when I'm pullin up

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
You pay for your fame, no fortune
Red Bottoms, no Forces
Rari, talkin' 'bout the horses

Why you pull up in a Charger?
I never leave my nigga starvin'
Cake, I can put you on a plate
Audemar, make it skate
I won't take your bitch on a date, yah
I gotta flex up, flex up
Ridin' 'round like Hulk Hogan
Droppin' the top and I'm boastin'
Bitches on me like lotion, uh
Fuck a hoe, keep the money closer
Put a hunnid in my sofa
Got the burner like a toaster
Like a blunt, I'mma smoke you
Nah, I won't feel like a torch
Got the Mase' sayin' fuck a Porshe
Got the rollie when I jumped off my porch
All my cars is sport
I'm racked up, let 'em talk
Don't hate cause it's not my fault
You're Goyard a knockoff
I don't need a shooter to pop off

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
AP with the bust down bracelet
