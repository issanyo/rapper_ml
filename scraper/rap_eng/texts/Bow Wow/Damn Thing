[Intro]
Yo, you ever be out and see somebody
That you want right then and there?
You know when they feel like talkin'
You just wanna walk right up to 'em and be like

[Refrain: Bow wow and Da Brat]
Hey shorty, what I gotta do? Say what?
To get one night with you, one night
I ain't tryna play no game, is that right?
I'm just tryna do to the damn thang

Hey boy, first lemme say, what up?
If I ever let you play
You never would leave, you'd wanna stay, why?
'Coz I'm known for doin' my damn thing

[Verse 1]
Pump no gas liquid in this young fly mister
I could turn a Honda to 745 whip
Shorty, if I ride wit you, that would be a nice picture
If somebody say cheese, they talkin' 'bout me like hey

No holla back, though I got a lotta that
I could have you in some True Religious, Louis this, Gucci that
Shake what she gave you, your momma would be proud of that
Once I get you back some, you ain't gon' know how to act

You on fire, oh I think I, oh I think I like ya
Boy, I think I, boy, I think I might just
Let you hold the Lambo, let you ride the Coupe
Spin rubberband banks, girl, tell me, tell me

[Refrain: Bow wow and Da Brat]
Hey shorty, what I gotta do? Say what?
To get one night with you, one night
I ain't tryna play no game, is that right?
I'm just tryna do to the damn thang

Hey boy, first lemme say, what up?
If I ever let you play
You never would leave, you'd wanna stay, why?
'Coz I'm known for doin' my damn thing

[Verse 2]
I see you runnin' 'round with these regular cats
I was just thinkin' to myself you could do better than that
I'm so ahead of the pack, be normal [Incomprehensible]
That's how you say what you spread in the back

Like hey shorty, what I gotta say?
Where I gotta take you, what I gotta pay?
Even it's for a night or if it's only for a day
I promise Bow won't bite, Bow will behave

Even though you on fire, oh I think I, oh I think I like ya
Boy, I think I, boy, I think I might just
Let you hold the Lambo, let you ride the Coupe
Spin rubberband banks, girl, tell me, tell me

[Refrain: Bow wow and Da Brat]
Hey shorty, what I gotta do? Say what?
To get one night with you, one night
I ain't tryna play no game, is that right?
I'm just tryna do to the damn thang

Hey boy, first lemme say, (what up?)
If I ever let you play
You never would leave, you'd wanna stay, (why?)
