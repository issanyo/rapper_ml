[Verse 1]
Do it for the ladies
Here we go
They say age ain't nothin but a number right
I know just what u need, I know just what you like
Now baby dim the lights and get comfortable
I got enough dick to fill you up like Papadeaux
That grown man talk baby let's just keep real
And I ain't no magician but let me Copperfield
Baby my love is real tell me where you want it at
And she know my game sharper than a pack of thumbtacks
Baby let me tell you where you can put your clothes at
Throw them on the floor and leave yo heels by the doormat
Yeah you leaving here with a sore back
Love my dick so much she had to go and get my name tat
Talk to me, like what?

[Hook]
Shhh break it down
I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow
No they better not dare

[Verse 2]
Um please don't interrupt us
Neighbours complaining saying we causin' a raucous
To show you just what kind of mood im in
I put that Your Body's Calling R.Kelly CD in
Yeah so tonight is goin down right
Have you running to yo friends tellin dem what Bow like
Talkin to them like that nigga put it down right
Had me pent up I swear to god girl I came twice (It?s what I do to em)
I'm Mister do it for the ladies
Known to drive these ladies crazy they all want to have my babies (huh?)
More than I love her you my homie baby
You my one and only now come n put it on me (Holla)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Only got eight bars left we running out of time
Im glad I got you yeah you little light of mine
I goin to thinkin about u when im out in town
Tell dem other dudes like new edition they can cool it now
Because you with Boweezy baby it's that simple
I love it when u smile it compliments your dimples
And u know my love is unconditional
And for these hoes on the road girl I'll never diss you (Never Yeah!)

[Hook]
