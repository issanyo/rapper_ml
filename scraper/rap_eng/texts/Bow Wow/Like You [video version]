I ain't neva had nobody show me
All the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
('Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like u)
Now I done been with different kind of girls
Like I done seen 'em all but ain't none of them at all
(Like u)
And I done seen the best of the best
Baby, still I ain't impressed 'cause ain't none of them at all
(Like u)
If you know how I feel when I chill
If I'm seen with a girl then she gotta be just
(Like u)
And baby that's the way I feel
And I got no choice but for me to keep it real
'Cause when we first got together
Started hanging out you was
Skeptical at first had to figure out if
I was the kind of guy to try to dog you out but
I ain't that kind of guy you tried to make me out
You found out when you turned into my baby
I showed them other brothers how to treat a lady
I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes
And I ain't tripping or acting shady
'Cause baby you know
I ain't neva had nobody show me
All the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon always be together baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
('Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like u)
And every time I think about you
(I cry)
When you ride when you call when you come I
(Ride)
Your love is amazing to me
Can't wait 'til I see you
(I wanna be with you again)
And every time you're out on the road
(I make a trip)
And whenever I'm doing a show
(Don't you forget)
That I'm your
(Main chick)
Who got that
(Game chick)
One and the
(Same chick)
The one you can hang with
I ain't neva had nobody show me
All the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gone always be together baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
('Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like u)
Okay when you hit the mall pop tags spend a few g's

(Season)
It ain't nothing it's you the one I care for
Feel like I ain't doing enough that's when I share more
(Share more)
I give you this give you that what you need love
(Love)
You know I got it holla at me if you need love
(Love)
And affection 'cause I'll be your protection
Kinda hard job but I'll do it to perfection
And you can tell that I ain't tryna let you go
I get with you when I can so that's how I let you know
And you be tripping 'cause sometimes I gotta go
But you the first one I hollared to right after my shows
And I was tripping in a sense I was tense
From my body loose around you what I'ma do without you
I gotta get it together say whateva
Since I met you my life seems so betta

All the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
