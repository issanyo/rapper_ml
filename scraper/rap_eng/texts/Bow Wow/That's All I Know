All I know, is when I'm with you
You make me feel so good, through & through
The way you walk & the way you talk
You know you look so good, you make me forget about (all I know)
I been looking for you girl for a minute now
The way you ?? how you puts it down
See this dog just don't bark easy
You gotta be off the heazy, fa sheezy
Make young weezy wanna get w/ it
And lock down all yo digits, talk to you for hours at a time
About whatever comes across ya mind
When we out, girls run up, you don't even trip
You get a kick out of watchin' 'em flip
I wanna live for ya slim, I ain't never been like this
But it's cool cuz I like this
Got you a two way so you don't miss a beat
For the times that I'm workin' and I cannot speak
All my homies tease me say you got me sprung
But they just mad cuz they ain't got one
All I know, is when I'm with you
You make me feel so good, through & through
The way you walk & the way you talk
You know you look so good, you make me forget about (all I know)
My lil' homie, my road dog
We really kill 'em when we step through the mall lookin just alike
Both got cornrows, two bags each
Both so fresh from our head to our feet
Only disagree when we talk ball play
I say I.V. you say M.J
You say you w/ me that's when you're mistaken
I ain't Omar Epps & you ain't Sanaa Lathan
How do you? Let's find another subject
A girl that understands, you gotta love that
A yound Sergio Valente, Louis Vutonne
?? rockin' and like to have fun
Fresher than the next chick
No need for you to ever sweat the next chick
Indeed, I'll make the next chick see the exit w/ speed
Cuz you're the only thing that I need
All I know, is when I'm with you
You make me feel so good, through & through
The way you walk & the way you talk
You know you look so good, you make me forget about (all I know)

[Bridge 2x]
Shorty, do you really, really love me?
Shorty, do you really, really care?
Shorty, do you really, really need me?
Cuz if so I'ma be right here
All I know, is when I'm with you
You make me feel so good, through & through
The way you walk & the way you talk
You know you look so good, you make me forget about (all I know)
