[Verse 1- Bow Wow]
I'm that girl loving, car dubbin', rims scubbing, teen
I've been bad to the bone, since I stepped on the scene
I've been club ready, 'bout my feady, game so mean
Hypnotizing these hoes, like they gone off that lean
I'm that track flippin, up one dippin, he can do whatever man
If you 12in this, man then i kno that's what your sayin'
I'm the house-wrecker, mic-checker, Homie with a plan
If I said it, then I did it, Lil nigga, I'm the man
I'm that trend-settin', big-bettin', always lookin Fly
I'm That cocky, poppin', ain't no stoppin', reachin' for the sky
I'm a boss playa, baby ain't another like I
Screamin' live homie; "you can't take it with you when you die"
C'mon

[Hook]
I got that ‘09 flow
Girls beatin' down my dow (door)
With me thats how it goes
A Hundred Thou' a show
Me making records, movies, and tv shows
It equals MO MONEY, MO MONEY, MO MONEY, MO MONEY, MO MONEY
OOOOOOH
I got that ‘09 flow
Girls beatin' down my dow
With me thats how it goes
A Hundred Thou' a show
Me making records, movies, and tv shows
It equals MO MONEY, MO MONEY, MO MONEY, MO MONEY, MONEY
OOOOOOH

[Verse 2- T. Waters]
(HEY, HEY)
I'm that flame spittin, Yank fitted leanin to the side
24 pendent door, folks leanin in the ride
Rims spinnin', Hoes grinnin', you know what it is
My flow to the dow, walls movin in the crib
"Where you live?"
Nah nigga, mind ya business, you probably wouldn't even find the shit
Diamond rings, hood rich, like it's something bitch, and ima have a lil fun with this
I'm a straight better, game checker, "put-her-in-her-place"
So poof, yea she disappear, gone without a trace
Summer rockin' the black Prada kicks without the lace
The Dirty, just ain't the Dirty, lil dirrty, without the base
Niggas So So Def, them niggas is gettin cake
2005, Young and Fly and Flashy up in your face
HAH!

[Hook]

[Verse 3- Bow Wow]
I'm that country talking, sea-walking, youngin with the bounce
I got girls and money coming at me the same in large amounts
Im that chain swingin', heat bring, problem for the rest of yall
It's like this shorty, drop come and get with me if you want to ball
Car switchin by the day, stuttin' all through the A
Hands up crunk like lil scrappy "OKAY-K-K"
I'ma genius like Ray, for my downfall niggas pray, but I
Careless what a nigga might say, especially when they keep tryin' to get in my way
New sneakers, pockets way deeper than yours
I'm a junkie for this, you can smell it coming out of my pores
Unlike yall lil homies, im getting up out of the stores
I got a lot but I'm still tryin to get get get get me, get me some more
CHECK IT OUT!
