Caught Up

[Verse 1]
Man I'm caught up between the two
I don't know what to do
Should I be honest (or should I be)
And to tell'em both the truth (what should I do)
And I know they know each other I know (that is wrong)
But I can't fight my feelings no more
And she don't know that you be riding this horse, Polo
Begging me to hit it raw I be like "no no"
And when I'm with shawty I be texting at the same time
Have her best friend all night hittin' my main line
I wish I could fuck'em at the same time
Got em both strippin' for a nigga on the FaceTime
And if they, find out, about this
I know that they gon' be trippin'
Gotta play, it cool
Or both of these bitches might kill me

[Hook]
Way too real
Can't let'em find out, let'em find out
It's gon' get real
(it's about to go down)
And if I had it my way I'd have both of em, that real
(If I had it my way)
Just me and my two bad bitches on the side that real
(Me and my two bad bitches)
Shits about to get real (it's about to get real) (turnup)
(it's about to get real)

[Verse 2]
Now the whole time my nigga had a girlfriend
But I'm still fucking off with her best friend
Man I can't even stay away from her
That's cause a nigga really love her
Then she wanna be my main lady
But she can't be my main lady (why)
And I know this gon' sound shady (what)
But my other girl 'bout to have my baby (turnup)
And my other girl know about us
Damn, now I know I'm in some shit (goddamn)
She went through my phone last night (last night)
And saw all them naked pictures that you sent
And now she's crazy, crazy
Talkin' 'bout how she gon' kill me and that bitch
I'm like "come on baby, baby" (I love everything about you)
She think I'll go crazy 'cuse that's my thing
