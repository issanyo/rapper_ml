Want me to sell my soul
Just so I can go gold
Homie I'm
Listen up man, I'm a hard head
You understand that man I can't change my ways
Wantin' me to be Will Smith
But I gotta be Bow
Feel me, I'm
Hey man, I'm a big fan of that man
But I gotta create my own legacy
And all I need is drough
And NBA2K10
And my niggas, and I'm
That's all I need in this world to make me happy man
You can have the cars, clothes
The jewelleries, the houses and hoes
Homie I'm
If I gotta go through all that shit man
Ya'll can take it back

[Verse one]
Hold up nigga, ya'll already know
Your homie Bow, people don't make full roll ups nigga
Nigga talk tough when they be on twitter
Then they see him out in person and they act like bitches
Man they hate on me cos they want my position
But I don't give a fuck homie, I ain't tripping
Stay on me grind, gotta hustle hard
Trying to put me out the game they don't wanna see you
Boy am I on other shit
Damn man I'm bout to turn 23
Got me thinking bout kids and a wife and a life
I ain't stunting that nothing if it ain't benefitting me
In this game dog, ain't no loyalty
Cats do anything for a little bit of fame
And a little bit of change, niggas switch crews
That's hip hop dick ridin and you look lame
These record execs don't know nothing dog
All they do is sit up in their office ya'll
Perfect example New Jack City Part 2
My last album that was Sony's fault
Got tired of that corny shit
Tired of all this phony shit
And I don't know you and you don't know me
So quit with all that 'homie' shit

[Hook]
Want me to sell my soul
Just so I can go gold
Homie I'm
(Wonderful music)
Wanting me to be Will Smith
But I gotta be Bow
Feel me, I'm
(Wonderful music)
And all I need is drough
And NBA2K10
And my niggas, and I'm
(Wonderful music
You can have the cars, clothes
The jewelleries, the houses and hoes
Homie I'm
(Wonderful music)

[Verse two]
Man the game has changed
106 ain't even the same
So hard for me to watch TV
Got thug niggas out here
Plotting on, rap has changed
Man the game ain't what it used to be
Niggas fake, niggas envy
Industry snakes, they ain't friendly
Thought she loved me, she just tricked me
Hard to sell now, all fans are iffy
Cats send me demos all the time
Then when they ask for some advice
I tell that young man stay in school
This rapping shit, think it over twice
Chew you up, then they spit you out
Here today, then you're gone tomorrow
Whatever you accomplish
They'll find another one to follow
Man that's just how the game is
Man that's just how the game go
I've seen rappers make millions off this shit
When the work stops then they end broke
Gotta keep your guard up
Never know when a nigga out there tryna throw you a blow
Just thought i'd let you know. No
Leggo!
