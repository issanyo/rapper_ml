[feat. Meek Mill]

[Bridge:]
Money over bitches, word to my mama tho
I'm just tryna make some change, ain't talkin bout Obama ho
Shorty got the best brain, never been to college though
Bad bitches, line up, knock em down like dominos

[Hook:]
Get it in, I'm on my shit again
Pull up to the club, Ferrari or the Benz
If she fuckin with the 4, she gotta be a 10
If you think they can outball me, they chances probably slim

[Verse 1:]
Catch me ballin out in Philly but no brain in 6
So pull me up and king I'm fresh on all, getting all the bitches
I'm that cash money hot boy, you don't want none of this
Big as your hate but I bet they hoes lovin it
I'm the prince bitch, crown me
Stay fresh like Downey
Plus they know I got more bars then the county
Call me Mr. Stunt Horse
Still got the black car, Lambo's in the front yard

[Verse 2:]
Chyeah, that was Forbes on the lines
See had to take a lifetime to calculate every dime
Damn, shit I gotta get that bread
Had lil niggas on the scene the shouldn't be wind up dead
I got a daughter to provide for
I got a daughter I'd die for
Until you hatin niggas die slow
I stay movin with my head on my shoulders
Know them haters plottin, wantin me to lose my composure nigga

[Verse 3:]
Yea, one time for my city yo
Cause this that 614, Cap City flow
So many diamonds in the watch
Jewelry stupid loud like alarm clocks
For my team it's whatever, we all in it together
YMCMB, boy nobody do it better
We the hottest commodity
Who wild is as hot as we?
You niggas alright to me, we da best obviously
