[Verse 1]
Fly nigga is me bitch, Waves on spin dont get sea sick
Oh its a movie? NetFlix, all bitch niggas head toward the exit

Y'all niggas ain't fucking with me I really hung with Obama

You niggas don't won't no problems, calling JD I got it
I'm fucking like err model, I'm throwing back err' bottle
