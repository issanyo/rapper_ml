[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Go ahead, fuck it up
Forgiato when I'm pulling up
I put Forgi's on a Bentley truck
Made it hurricane when I hit the club
Fucking up a check, fucking up a check
Fucking up a check, let's fuck up a check
Fucking up a check, fucking up a check
Let's fuck up a check, fucking up a check

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
I'm fucking up designer, I'm fucking up Versace
When I hit the club, tattoos on my body
Make it hurricane, make it thunderstorm
I'mma make it flash flood, ain't no one
Walked in the club, I got all of this cash, yuh
I'mma hit the club, yeah I'mma bring them bands, yuh
Bring them bands out, bring them xans out
She just dropped it down, chopper hundred rounds
I got a check, I got a check, and they know that I'm stunting
She want the dick, she want the dick, I gave her the dick and some molly
I post in the club, I post in the club, I'm sitting on Forgiato's
All this money on me, I came from the bottom

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Go ahead, fuck it up
Forgiato when I'm pulling up
I put Forgi's on a Bentley truck
Made it hurricane when I hit the club
Fucking up a check, fucking up a check
Fucking up a check, let's fuck up a check
Fucking up a check, fucking up a check
Let's fuck up a check, fucking up a check

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Everything new down to my shoes
From my belt to my shoes to my Christian Loubs'
Hopped out the coupe too, dog pouring up juice
Walking in the club pouring up, bottles and I'm too cool
I came from the bottom, you don't want these problems
I be getting money, riding with my shottas
Riding with my shooters, hanging with the goblins
Riding with a bad bitch hopping out bugattis
Pinkie ring plus my cuban link cost a new Ferrari
Hopping out the Jag, watch a nigga flash, snapped by paparazzi

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Go ahead, fuck it up
Forgiato when I'm pulling up
I put Forgi's on a Bentley truck
Made it hurricane when I hit the club
Fucking up a check, fucking up a check
Fucking up a check, let's fuck up a check
Fucking up a check, fucking up a check
Let's fuck up a check, fucking up a check

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
I just blew my CSI money on a bad bitch
Soulja blow that VH1 money, dog you been rich
Came in a 2-seater, how these hoes gon' fit
We don't love 'em, we don't cuff 'em, and you know that she a flip
Couple bad white bitches and we got 'em off the blow
Now the molly kicking in, you know these hoes is 'bout to go
Gotta weigh Lil Soulja up my nigga those are from a four
We just fuck 'em, let 'em go
Soulja, we don't love these hoes
We at LD on a monday, young rich niggas in my section
It's a hundred G for my necklace, young nigga pull up hot but I'm flexing

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Go ahead, fuck it up
Forgiato when I'm pulling up
I put Forgi's on a Bentley truck
Made it hurricane when I hit the club
Fucking up a check, fucking up a check
Fucking up a check, let's fuck up a check
Fucking up a check, fucking up a check
Let's fuck up a check, fucking up a check
