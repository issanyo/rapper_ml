[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I'm seeing hella chicks in the love chamber
Hear the sounds of overload saying, costing danger
Baby girl a banger, got me crawling on all fours
I don't know, I like it though
You see the way she, do it, do it, do it, do it
And I'ma have to, do her, do her, do her, do her
So mama, whatchu saying?
Baby girl, let's make it, shawty, I ain't playing

[Hook: Omarion]
Girl, I love, girl, I love how you doing that when you pop it on the floor
Got me gone, ain't no coming back
Make your body go slam, ay
Girl, make your body go, slam, ay
Girl, I love how you doing that when you pop it on the floor
Got me gone, ain't no coming back
Make your body go slam, ay
Girl, make your body go, slam, ay

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
All the bad girls, man, you know you know that I'ma bag
And I'ma leave with five like Donnavon McNabb
Chrome 22's, baby, sittin' on the back
Don't worry 'bout the drivin' 'cause the chauffeur does that
And I'm a hood star, you know just who I are
The boy balls hard like the Sun's point guard
You say you gotta man, I bet he ain't like Bow
He don't do the thangs for you, he don't make you say wow
See girl, I'm a vet, I'm known as the best
And just like Keith, I make the girls Sweat
Whatever you need, boo, I got it on deck
So when it come to other guys, you can tell they can step

[Hook: Omarion]
Girl, I love, girl, I love how you doing that when you pop it on the floor
Got me gone, ain't no coming back
Make your body go slam, ay
Girl, make your body go, slam, ay
Girl, I love how you doing that when you pop it on the floor
Got me gone, ain't no coming back
Make your body go slam, ay
Girl, make your body go, slam, ay

[Verse 4: Omarion]
Pull up to the club, step up out the coupe
With Bow Weezy, Omarion, Chris
Man, we 'bout to act foolish and you know them boys ain't playing by the rules
Young guns running, we have any girl we choose
Bad and you nervous, man, them boys don't lose
Haters gonna hate but we keep them confused
Hits from everywhere, drop it down so ooh
Shawty on the floor making it do what it do
Omarion, plus 21 and it's on
I'm in the V.I.P, nigga pass the Patron

[Hook: Omarion]
Girl, I love, girl, I love how you doing that when you pop it on the floor
Got me gone, ain't no coming back
Make your body go slam, ay
Girl, make your body go, slam, ay
Girl, I love how you doing that when you pop it on the floor
Got me gone, ain't no coming back
Make your body go slam, ay
Girl, make your body go, slam, ay
