When I was 8 I was rhymin' not back yard game playin'
Watchin' Snoop anxiously and waitin' for my chance man
Hot and cocky wit it cause I know that I am man
I'm goin' down in history like American Band Stand
I stay fresh to def like the neighborhood dope man
I stay on the top cause I keep comin' wit dough man
U steady watchin' steady but there ain't no hope man
U dealin' wit somethin' bigger than the US open
And ain't no jokin'
Fresh like fatlaces and dukey ropes and I keep on smokin'
Young but I'm ready so that means I'm strokin'
If you pet me now days girl a dawg is soakin'
Addicted to it JD say I got it bad
18 nigga makin' more than yo dad (see)
They think they doin' it but I'ma out do em
If you know somebody like that pull up and say to em

Ye ain't ridin' (ye ain't ridin')
Ye ain't bumpin' like I'm bumpin'
Ye ain't sayin' nothing homie
Ye ain't fresh azimiz
Ye ain't got it (ye ain't got it)
You don't keep it thuggin' like I keep it thuggin'
Lil buddy you ain't fresh azimiz

Ye ain't big (big) whipping
Ye ain't steady ti tippin'
No girl getting homie
You ain't fresh azimiz
Think you is (Think ya is) but you ain't
Think u can get it crunk like me but u can't

Now every record that I make I'm tryin' to get up out the store man
Every car I drive I'm tryin' have u sayin' whoa man
Fourth album comeback power like rogaine
Records say Columbia but I'm So So man
I stay on my grind bringin' in that dough man
From records to movies now a TV show man
Anything given to me I'm gon' rep man
Big house, big cars what u expect man
Just to get a glimpse girls breakin' they neck man
Blinded by the light glistenin' off the Breitling
Bow hot as ever I ain't lost no step
Straight t-shirt, sneaker I ain't tryin' to go prep
Like these lil' R & B groups that need my help
Wish they had my style wish they had my rep
But oh no, u'll never have it like me man
And if u can't understand this is what I'm sayin'

Ye ain't ridin' (ye ain't ridin')
Ye ain't bumpin' like I'm bumpin'
Ye ain't sayin' nothing homie
Ye ain't fresh azimiz
Ye ain't got it (ye ain't got it)
You don't keep it thuggin' like I keep it thuggin'
Lil buddy you ain't fresh azimiz

Ye ain't big (big) whipping
Ye ain't steady ti tippin'
No girl getting homie
You ain't fresh azimiz
You think you is (Think ya is) but you ain't
Think u can get it crunk like me but u can't

I got a spot in MIA to get away from the cold weather
Talk around town as if I'm wit Ciara
Bow fall off nigga that'll be never
I'm rich (yea I'm rich) I can do whatever
I get a kick outta shuttin' suckas down in the parkin' lot
Especially when they tryin' to stunt thinking they hot
All out the window talking loud like they runnin' my block
That's when I come through (come through) and all that stop
And ain't another young'n keep it fresh like dis man
Every year, same time come wit them hits man
Tired of makin' girls fall out wit a kiss man
Well listen and you're stuck music just like quick sand
Older people say that lil' young dude sick man
Young AI and we Cru thick man
Difference between you and me is you b bricklin'
And I ain't never ever done that before (no)

Ye ain't ridin' (ye ain't ridin')
Ye ain't bumpin' like I'm bumpin'
Ye ain't sayin' nothing homie
Ye ain't fresh azimiz
Ye ain't got it (ye ain't got it)
You don't keep it thuggin' like I keep it thuggin'
Lil buddy you ain't fresh azimiz

Ye ain't big (big) whipping
Ye ain't steady ti tippin'
No girl getting homie
You ain't fresh azimiz
You think you is (Think ya is) but you ain't
Think u can get it crunk like me but u can't
