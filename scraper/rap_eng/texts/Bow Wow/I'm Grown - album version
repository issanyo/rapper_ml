Dark Child, yes, yelling to the lite beat
And it's B Dub and Tiffany
And we are in the place to be
And we came in to move your feet
And get things jumping like they're supposed to
Teen magazines were jumping right out the posters
Can't believe what you saying in lip gloss
I know you can't believe she getting older
She's just a teen so how could she
Really know what she wants?
I can't believe you'd think I'd run
And tell you're mean to me
When it's really like she mean, ain't she?
I know just what you think
You're so stuck in the past
Like stone washed jeans
And I can endorse anything through me
I'm flyer then you'd ever thought I'd be
You wonder why I'm so cold
You coulda been more involved but no
I'm not the girl that you knew before
I can't believe you didn't I'm grown
I'm grown now
Certified and all that
You say want you want
You can't take a thing from me
I'm grown now
(Oh)
I, I, I'm grown now
(I'm grown)
I'm grown now
Got my own money
You ain't gonna run me
I ain't no dummy
I'm grown now
(Yeah)
I, I, I'm grown now
(I'm grown)
I can't believe they tryna block me
Just to playing them games I thought you'd be
Up in my lead but no you can't compete
Back up don't touch gotta give me 50 feet
'Cause I'm a on another level
I'm bringing things to life like I'm Gapetto
This is the last time that I'm gonna tell you
I'm doing it big now, you wanna piece let it go
You wonder why I'm so cold
You coulda been more involved but no
I'm not the girl that you knew before
I can't believe you didn't I'm grown
I'm grown now
(Oh)
I, I, I'm grown now
(I'm grown)
I'm grown now
Got my own money
You ain't gonna run me

I'm grown now
(Yeah)

Aye, Tiff yo big brotha got you, it's happing
You push one hand to the cloud then back to the wind
Bow and Tiff Evans is back at it again
Yea, ma, you grown go on and let you rims spin, yea
You got ya lil premiers
These 50 lil days go head and let you paint drip
(Drip)
Tell your parents don't trip
And when ya girls go on ya lil trips
It's your world, lil mama, it's your life to live
I'm not those girls your used to dating
I gotta unique situation
(I'll tell you the truth)
You can travel the world but you'll never find someone
(That will take care of you)
I'll have you open 'cause
I'm grown now
(Oh)
