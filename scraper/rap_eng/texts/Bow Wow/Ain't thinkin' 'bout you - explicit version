Aye, aye Chris
Aye, man
You know, it's been a long time since we hooked up man
And did something real, you know
Something for 'em, for 'em ladies, you dig that?
Oh yeah
You know we hate, you know we hate, you know we hate
You know we do it for the ladies
You got the wrong one if you think I ain't goin' out
You used to be the the only girl a nigga would think about
I got a couple girls on call, I'm goin' to bring them out
Imagine me seein' strip with one, so this what this is all about?
I'm in the club doin' my two-step, I pulled about 8 broads already
I'm just getting my feet wet
But I ain't even knocking yo style
'Cause I'd be here all day tryna count how many girls want Bow
Ooh, I see you on the blogs, what you're doing and all that
But little do you know, you making yourself look whack
Your dude got a problem, better tell him to fall back
I'm goin' real big in V.I.P., hear that loud tack
See, it's me and Chris in here, so you know it's real thick in here
Better get yo girl 'cause yo bitch is in here
Tryin' to see how many I can fit in my Lambo
I never go raw, got my strap like Rambo
I'm not looking for love 'cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottle's on us, so drink on
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
Find a little shawty I like
And, girl, when I'm in the club, really turned up
I ain't goin' to think about you tonight
I ain't thinkin' about you tonight
We done been together for a minute
Now it feels funny 'cause to be doing something different
But it's all good, me and you finished
Callin' me a player, but a nigga ain't trippin'
And I ain't sayin' that he don't love you
But I don't think he love you like I do
But it's okay, it's alright
My Blackberry's filled with a whole bunch of women
Wasting time, steady tryin' to get you back
Get you back in my life
You don't care, you don't care
It used to be you that I like, but I'ma do what I like tonight
I'm gon' get tipsy
Over 21, all the girls have fun
And watch the ladies jump on me
I'm not looking for love 'cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottle's on us, so drink on
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
Find a little shawty I like
And, girl, when I'm in the club, really turned up
I ain't goin' to think about you tonight
I ain't thinkin' about you tonight
I'm bein' honest, this is shawty, I don't want you no more
So leave the keys to the Benz 'fore you hit the front door
'Cause you lose it, and she chose it
And like Chris said, I'm chucking up the deuces
Onto the next one
All I ask is keep it real
Couldn't do that
So I'ma tell you how I feel
I'm poppin' bottles all night
'Cause that black card ain't got no limit, all right?
Hey
I'm not looking for love 'cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottle's on us, so drink on
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
Find a little shawty I like
And, girl, when I'm in the club, really turned up
I ain't goin' to think about you tonight
I ain't thinkin' about you tonight
I ain't thinkin' about you tonight
I ain't thinkin' about you tonight
