[Hook: Sean Kingston]
They see me lookin good
They sayin I done changed

But im still the same
So thats not the case im busy gettin money on tour
Man I put that on my hood, hood, hood
Man I put that on my hood, hood, hood
Im the same man

[Verse 1: Shad Moss]
The boy doin numbers
I do it for colombus
I put my city on the map now go locate a compass
They sayin I done changed, additude ain't the same
I guess this the negative effects that money brangs
Im still the same Shad from Bucktown
Ain't nothin changed but the label, im reppin cash money now
Got love for the hood, im still givin back
And sum still hate, well boy im used 2 that
Uh, and I got my mom a bigger house, do it for the people they the only 1s I care about
Instead they make me out to be somethin that im not
Sayin that I only care about hoes in my cash knots

[Hook: Sean Kingston]

[Verse 2: Shad Moss]
Thru the resession I was helpin people thru the drought
This is for my people who is locked up and ain't gettin out
And bart came home, no more phat time
While he was locked up I made sure that his daughter fine
Yea, now thats real people,they got people registerd 2 vote now how much realer do it get?
And I love givin back, puttin smiles on kids faces
Payin off tuitions makin sure they get an education. (it ain't nothin)
I would never turn my back on yall, sis we used 2 window shop but now we tearin down the mall
Now im puttin up position to helpin make a diffrence
I kno I mess up sometimes so I ask God for forgivness
