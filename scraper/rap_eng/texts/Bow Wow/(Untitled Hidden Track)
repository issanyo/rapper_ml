West coast just crip walk-ipwalk wit me
East coast just Harlem shake sh- shake with me
Midwest just chicken head-enhead with me
Dirty South just b-b-bounce b-bounce with me

[Chorus]
I'm B-A-C-K (oh!) [Repeat: x3]
Bow Bow Bow Wow

Me fall off? Dog you can't be serious
Cause I've been doing this since I was in baby diapers
All my life this talent be bumpin' in my veins
I know these girls is happy that I'm back in the game
While I was gone the question was, When ya album come out?
Another one to go cop so y'all could scream and shout
Been away for a minute
Negotiatin' some deals
Discussin' some business on how I can make mils
Man, it feels good to know that ya fans love it
I've been flyin' back and forth just meetin' with Warner Bros
You know, sitcom's gonna be on yo TV
So all the Bow Wow fans could see me on GP

[Chorus]
Every dog has his day so right now be mine
I ain't no unpolished I'm a polished diamond that shine
Had to retire my Mickey Mouse, I gotten too old
Peach fuzz on my lip, homeboy I'm grown
I'm that east side e-saving 614
Rep it girl get a playboy that flow, got that to look at
Be on top number one is my rank
I enjoy sittin' back watchin' y'all mc's sing (uhu uh)
You see that Z? That's me inside
I blow chicks minds when they see me pushin' the ride
I'm back and dog I ain't cuttin' no slack
I'm back for my homie (yeah)
Ya heard that?

[Chorus]
Oh, you want some advice?
Well, without a doubt
Dog don't come out when Bow Wow's out
When I spit my rhymes be as sharp as a dart
Another album that's finished, shoot straight up the charts
Number one videos straight to 106
Every suburban middle American gonna be bumpin' this
See, I'm real don't worry
I got it on lock
When the boy wonder's around I shut down shop
Rapper slash actor slash
I cause total chaos
I got it in a smash
Homie ain't nobody hotter
I told you that I'm back
And I'm goin' back for the whole enchilada, you got it

[Chorus]
