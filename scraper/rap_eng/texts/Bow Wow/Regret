I can't lie man theres some stuff I regret like
Letting my fans down and cheatin on my ex right
But im young so what, yea ima make mistakes
And besides nobodys perfect any fucking way
Ha, I swear to god the press be all on me (yea)
Oscar mayor bloggers, everything they writes baloney
N why I feel like I got the whole world on me
Got all the money in the world yet im still lonely
And why the fuck my best friend had to steal from me
Couldn't keep it real so for that I had to leave sony
Sometimes I wanna quit rap like im through with it
Why I dont get my respect and why its like im new to this
They hate because im fly, shoulda came with a stewardess
When I did that show with omarion, I was losin it
Im on BET actin an asshole, fightin in an interview
Why I do that for? I can't lie I was drugged out
Sippin syrup, smoking weed shit had me bugged out
Even jermaine didn't know who I was
He know me best, he been around me since day one
And our relation-ship homie never changed
You can ask him im still Mr. money-ain't-a-thang
Got homies back home talkin bout he done changed
Lil arrogant bastard, he dont act the same
Who really write his shit, is it tip or is it wayne
Is it brat, is it jermaine, will yall let me do my thang
I dont even know what the big deal is
Im writing for myself, man yall niggas needa feel this
