Batman, I want you do me a favor
What ?
Sing a song for me ... loud
Oh all right hm hm

[Hook x2]
You Robin
I'm Batman
You just a Sidekick
Now play the Batman
I ain't jokin' around
Ain't no stoppin' me
All this Ice got me cold like Mister Freeze

[Verse 1]
I'm In my new whip, look at the wheels
Black R8 lookin like the batmobile,
I'm runnin' things, I'mma charge
Far as I can see
I'm ahead yall
I'm to advanced
We don't mood the same
A bunch of damon wayans
These niggas is Major paints
Wanted to quit rap, Life fuck it
Rather go to Hollywood
Pack up my luggage

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Where my competition at ?
White tee (WHAT ?) Cincinnati fitted cap (OHIO)
I'm still here , I got the throne
Never stop grindin I got hit on my own
Man, told you a minute for a long hour
So many women I think feelin' out my car love
I set the toe, now follow what i do, YMCMB that's the fuckin crew

[Hook x2]
