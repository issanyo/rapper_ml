And all I do is floss
You can even ask my dentist

Got a bad white bitch

Say you getting money muthafucka

All white tee blue jeans with a fitted cap
Always finish first place
Columbus is my birth place
Buzz bigger than where R. Kelly dropped the sextape

And I don't pay for girls
They let me fuck for free
Got girls on my twitter
Saying how they love fuckin me
How they love suckin me
These girls can't get enough of me
These hoes be studded cuffin me
They hands all down my dungarees
Was Lil Bow Wow
Now I'm just Bow now
Big faces small faces
Money tell as Yao now
Ya baby momma jockin me
She won't give me my privacy
I'm something like Dwight up in the paint
Ain't no stopping me
Aye who you is?

And I'm clean than a bitch
Like they ran me through a laundromat
