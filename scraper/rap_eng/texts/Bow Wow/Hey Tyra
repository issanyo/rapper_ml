I smell love in the air
All you missing is a cash money millionaire
And I know
You old enough to be my momma
I'm mature for my age
Tyra so that's ain't a problem
I got grown man paper
Monthly vacations
And you can be my girl
Like the temptations
Look them older guys can't treat you
Like I'll treat you
I'm Lamborhgini Moss baby let me two seat ya
I'll even put the Madden 10 away
All my focus is on you
Don't care what nobody say
And being with the dog
Tyra ain't no better place
Hold your hand, open doors every time we on a date
All you want is the respect
Well baby that's fair enough
My december boo
Yup she's a sagittarius
And all that hating from the media
Nope it ain't scaring us
And this ain't puppy love
I'm a pitbull terrier
Baby let me marry ya
I'll show you a better life
Show these old heads
How to really treat a woman right
Fell in love with ya
When I saw you on the Fresh Prince
How can I breathe when it's no air
Girl I breathe less
No I'm Jordan Sparks
I'm baby got to walk
Don't I kinda talk
So I climb Jack beanstalk on her
Did I forget to mention
That your so beautiful
It's been that way
Since you went to John barrell middle school
