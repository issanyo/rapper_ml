[Verse 1: JoJo]
Can somebody explain to me
Why everybody is tryin' to be
Livin' like a celebrity
Doin' what they see on MTV
Ice is cool but I'm looking for more
Simple things is what my heart beats for
Cause that's me
I don't ask for much
Baby
Having you is enough

[Chorus: JoJo]
You ain't got to buy nothin'
It's not what I want
Baby it's you
We don't have to go nowhere
It's not what I want
Baby it's you
It's not 'bout what you got
I know you got alot
No matter what you do, you always get it hot it's you, it's you
Baby all I want is you, yeah

[Verse 2: JoJo]
It don't matter that your car is fly, fly
And your rims are spinnin' on the side, and
It don't matter where we go tonight
Cause if I'm with you I'll be all right
That's cool, but I'm lookin for more
It's your love that my heart beats for
Cause that's me
Don't have to spend a dime
Baby
I just want your time

[Chorus: JoJo]
You ain't got to buy nothin'
It's not what I want
Baby it's you
We don't have to go nowhere
It's not what I want
Baby it's you
It's not 'bout what you got
I know you got alot
No matter what you do, you always get it hot it's you, it's you
Baby all I want is you, yeah
You ain't got to buy nothin'
It's not what I want
Baby it's you
We don't have to go nowhere
It's not what I want
Baby it's you
It's not 'bout what you got
I know you got alot
No matter what you do, you always get it hot it's you, it's you
Baby all I want is you, yeah

[Bridge: Bow Wow]
Five, four, three, two, one
Baby girl don't care 'bout my dough stack
And she a down chick and she know I love that
She sees past all this Bow Wow stuff
Because she knows at the end of the day the only thing that matters is us
And it be a lot of groupie on the road
But they can't do nothing for me I got a good gurl back at home
Matching charm bracelets and pendants whoever would of thought our relationship would be so tremendous
And lately, you been missin' me crazy
And anytime you miss me
Baby side kick page me
I got a dime piece you know she da bomb
The type of girl you bring home just to meet your mom
I'm not Larnez Tate but I think I caught a love jones
Cause I think about her every time I hear a slow song
And when she think about me I think about her too
When she ride for me baby I'mma ride for you
Let's go

[Chorus: JoJo]
You ain't got to buy nothin'
It's not what I want
Baby it's you
We don't have to go nowhere
It's not what I want
Baby it's you
It's not 'bout what you got
I know you got alot
No matter what you do, you always get it hot it's you, it's you
Baby all I want is you, yeah
