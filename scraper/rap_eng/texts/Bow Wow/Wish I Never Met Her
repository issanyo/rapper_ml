[Chorus]
I wish I never met her
I wish I never met her

[Verse 1]
A nigga threw a party and shorty came through
Looking good as hell, stepped in with your crew
Them Spanish bitches had my attention and you knew
And then you stormed off, can't be mad at you
Last night I drank so much
Can't't lie, I been missing your touch
I be stressing my feelings too much
I gave my heart to a girl and it got crushed

[Chorus]
I wish I never met her
Shit, I wish I never met her
And I wish I never met her
Wasting my time on you
Shit, girl, I deserve better
Girl, I deserve better

[Verse 2]
I wish I never met her
I wish I never met her on that video shoot
But she was looking so good to me
I told her I'm a stand up nigga
She like "I heard that before, you gotta prove to me"
Wish I never met her
Shoulda listened to the homies
Damn, I learned a lesson
Talking 'bout they pretty, [?] stressing
My other baby mama tripping on me, asking questions

[Chorus]
And I wish I never met her
Wasting my time on you
Shit, girl, I deserve better
Girl, I deserve better

[Bridge]
Said she just moved to the A
I knew that was a mistake
Shorty went right in the room
Ready to get in some brain
She a good girl but she like dog ass niggas, that's the truth
And if I ever find a love again, hell nah, I wanna be with you
She wanna settle down with me but I'm still fucking hoes whole night through
I keep at least twenty bitches in the crib, yeah, that's how I do

[Chorus]
And I wish I never met her
Wasting my time on you
Shit, girl, I deserve better
Girl, I deserve better

[Outro]
I wish I never met her, I wish I never met her
I wish I never met her, I wish I never met her
I wish I never met her
