Cuff yo chick!

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
In the beginning things was cool
Been together since school
I got played in the end
Had me looking like a fool
Thought she would be the one
Different from all the others
What we shared was more than a pun
Told me not to trust this shit
I was young, I was dumb, I should've paid attention
And I guess this is what I deserve for not listening
Imagined you being my wife
Don’t understand how you can say you love me
When you stabbed me in my back twice
You supposed to hold me down for life
Wasted time to argue with you
When you’re wrong and I’m right
Girl, you trite
So pack your bags, you can leave
Cause what the nigga need is a girl care for me
Bow Weezy

[Hook]
I thought I had it all
'til she got addicted to money and the fancy cars
Tell me this ain’t what love is all about
Just as soon as I got niggas, when she started acting funny
But shawty ain't in love with me, she in love with my money
(X2)

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
Now you mislead me, played me
Messed with my emotions
Now she caught up in the fast life
Can’t get this girl to act right
Fell in love with the limelight
Always gon' catch up her later
Now she at the club hanging out, where all the ball players
(Huh?)Gucci, Louis, Fendi, all she wants is the finer things
Rolfs, Benzes, attracted to what money brings
Love is blind, didn’t see her plottin’ on my figures
Threaten me that if I left her, she would Tiger Woods a nigga

[Hook]

[Outro]
That's right...
I thought you needed me girl (Playing, no I need you)
I thought you loved me girl(Playing, no I love you)
How could you use me baby? (What you trying to say?)
That I don’t want your love no more

I thought you needed me girl (Well, I need you too)
I thought you loved me girl (Well, I loved you too)
How could you use me baby? (So what you trying to say?)
That I don’t want your love no more

[Hook]
