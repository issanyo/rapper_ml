[Verse 1]
I don't know why
But it's like I can't stay quiet
This is my voice
I can't let it die inside me
See I'll be scared if there wasn't a riot
Pushing and pulling, grabbing some hair
Puking and fucking up the sidewalk
This battle makes it interesting
I abide desires
Like a dog pissing on the hydrant
Just to spite the fire
It's not to be taken lightly
The page is a set of eyelids
The booth is an instrument that God created
To record us trying to find him
But don't let the word throw you off
Religion and spirit are two different plots
Just know that it's bigger than me and my ego
When I'm flyin
Take me higher
I've got something to pray for
Please leave me when I'm guided
Who said that "Life is cinema"?
This is epic, be present
I'm right here

Selfish, selfish, selfish me, yeah, me, yeah
Girlfriend, break-up, new one, one-night stand, cheat, cheat, repeat that
Drug use, clean up, drug use, drug use, clean up, drug use, rehab
Fuck you, I suck dude, self-loathing, self-esteem, ego, then me again
Put a soundtrack right in the middle
A neverending quest to try and get fans
There you have the beginning, a middle and a really shitty end
Nah, give me a break through, can I get a montage, come on I need that
Humble me, give me a conflict, a hardship, let me break through this cement
They're gonna be so disappointed when they roll the credits and
I realize that my movie sucked and I was the only one that could edit it
Well the course, the chain of events, that would be the evidence, some say it's coincidence
I say I found something greater than myself and started accepting it
And I can see, feel, taste and smell again
And I'm the only one with the hammer to break this shell I'm in
It's gonna take me crackin' this mirror to finally be myself again
Met my potential a long time ago and I'm not stopping til I resemble him

(I got soul but I'm not a soldier...)
