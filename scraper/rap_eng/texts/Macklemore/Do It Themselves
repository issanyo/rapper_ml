[Verse 1: Illmaculate]
When what you want and what you can't have come in a conflict, that could cause a couple of problems
Well, I guess these ladies and labels
Have something in common
If they have it they own way they be fucking the artist
But, that's why I'm ducking your offers
No contracts or rings, see, I'm trying to hustle my hardest, ma
No distractions, it's killing me, she's feeling me though
She's so attractive plus she knows I'm the total package
Got the pounding stimulation she needs, right?
Plus with escalation what a famous emcee likes
She like to know, squeeze tight in them clothes
Thinking she'll get the green-light to go
It don't seem right... Right, you love the attention
Most the time it don't matter how slutty she's dressin'
All too often we act with ugly intentions
And they're selfishly defended when they come into question

[Hook: Illmaculate]
I see you doin' your thing
I ain't trying to hate on ya
Nah I ain't trying to ruin a thing
A lot of women though
I ain't pouring salt in your game
But if you'd listen close
Then you could probly relate, it goes...

*OnlyOne sample*
Now I ain't dissing women, now now I ain't dissing women
Now I ain't dissing women, that'd be foolish as hell
Now I ain't dissing women, that'd be foolish as hell
I just wish they wouldn't do it themselves

[Verse 2: Dain]
Chicks scoping me, I got a look from left to right ‘cause
Anything might just happen
I happen to be in a position where I got to see
If I'ma go home to the wife or [...]
Seems like some of the girls this age
That approach you would've boned you in anyway
Tried to tell one that I'm gay, but she was like
"Nah nigga, you'll just need me to go straight"
Papa told me play the cards that they deal to ya
Mama told me just remember how it feels to ya
So my consious is playing a role
Even if I'm away on the road I stay at home
‘Cause I don't want nonsense
"He say, she say" – cliché high school type gossip
About me going out with a mistress
Damn, mind your bitnezz, can I get a witness?
