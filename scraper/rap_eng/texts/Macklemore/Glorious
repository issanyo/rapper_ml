[Verse 1]
Another day, another breath (another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life
And some peace of mind
And seek and I find I can sleep when I die
Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And damn I'm straight
I'm on my wave, (I'm on my wave)
Get out my wake, I'm running late, (what can I say?)
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people or did I do it all for fame?
Legend it's exodus searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo!

[Chorus]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Bridge]
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag they don't understand
The world is up for grabs
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag they don't understand
The world is up for grabs

[Verse 2]
I feel glorious
Okay, okay, yes I do (Glorious)
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too (I was born for this born for this)
Another morning, a morning, don't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came

[Outro]
Things are just things
(I made it through the darkest part of the night)
They don't make you who you are
(I feel glorious, glorious)
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
Things are just things
(I made it through the darkest part of the night)
They don't make you who you are
(I feel glorious, glorious)
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
