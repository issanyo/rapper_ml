[Intro]
Just escape!

[Verse 1: Chris Mansfield]
My old man, he kicked me out, he kicked me out
When I told him that I live this way
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, he doesn't own me
He doesn't own me, he doesn't own me
He doesn't own me (Just escape!)

[Chorus: Chris Mansfield]
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling

[Verse 2: Chris Mansfield]
The black rims align your face
Like a deer drinking water in a picture frame
I swear to God I've seen those eyes
The back of my lids when closing mine
With clasped hands we shake it out, we shake it out
Lace our boots and we walk away
I felt slightly connected to him
And said now boy, now you own me

[Chorus: Chris Mansfield]
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
He doesn't sleep
So in truth he never wakes up
Another day rushing to his death
Out of breath on the treadmill of the famous
He makes mistakes
Tells stories to his paintbrush
And when the world finally sees his art
He wishes that he never would have made it
Just escape, just escape
Ricochets and eclipses faith
Living in a city with a grey umbrella over your shoulders
And you're becoming suffocated by the weight
Can't hit those brakes, this is what you wanted, huh?
But you got it all in vain
'Cause you forgot who you are
Right as the world learned your name
It goes...

[Chorus: Chris Mansfield]
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling

[Verse 4: Macklemore]
Let me ash my issues
Ashtray as this asphalt
American spirits, black coffee
Conversations and a passport
When God gives you everything
Everything that you ever asked for
And it still looks a bit different
Than when you pictured it on that back porch
And I'm gone
World traveller all I got is my songs
When the nights start blending into one another, and I don't recall
Tom Petty in this motherfucker, all I wanna do is free fall
Yeah, free fall
And I'm so caught up, I'm caught up
I'm caught up and I'm so tired
Swore that I wouldn't stare into the light
And guess who tried it, shit, I'm blinded
By this lime light, this lime light
It's all night, it's all day
These bright lights, these bright lights
Once you turn 'em on you can't walk away
Don't die here, don't die here
I came too far, I'm too great
But I'm too scared, I'm too afraid
To stare this world into its face
I'm almost home, I'm driving lost
My eyelids close, life turns to grey
The cameras off, the show is over
You close the curtains and just escape

[Chorus: Chris Mansfield]
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling
Arrows land, we’re falling
Arrows were falling

[Outro: Chris Mansfield]
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, I live this way
I live this way, I live this way

[Outro]
Just escape!
