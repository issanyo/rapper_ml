Return of the Mack, get up !
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me
To get up !
Fresh out, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope y'all can't copy
Yup. Bad
Moon walking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way...
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it !
And yet I'm on..
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money !
Stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on, for my town !

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us...
Like the ceiling can't hold us !

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us...
Like the ceiling can't hold us !

Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four track bussing...
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crush shit !

Labels out here
Now they can't tell me nothing
We give that to the people
Spread it across the country...

Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na !
Heeeey... And all my people say !
