[Intro: Macklemore]
Now they say, "Don't forget where you come from
Don't die holding on to your words
Cause you know, that you got a whole world to change
But understand who you gotta change first"

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
And I was like "Fuck that", humility bust back
I remember the days with nothing but a bus pass
I was just a little shorty, just hopin' that I could find a bum
To buy a 40 for me and have enough for a bud sack
Yeah, and I dance on that instrumental
Unorthodox like Basquiat with the pencil
Give me a microphone and a beat box I could vent to
Music the only medium that I could find myself through
Recluse, sippin' on some lean I would let loose
Lookin' in the mirror, watchin' myself lose
Cleaned up in oh-eight, got a job makin' barely minimum wage
To get into that page
Hit the road with R.L., performing in front of eight people
And that shit will check your ego
About around that time I'm watching that EP go
From nothing to getting us booked around the country
I know no limits, life can change in an instant
Eight people turn into sold out shows in a minute
Now watching my pops in the back row grinnin'
With his glass up to my mom, toastin' his Guinness

[Pre-Hook: Macklemore]
And we on, we on
Good music, it lies in the ambiance
One day we'll leave here
But these words live on
Till then, we keep on making the songs

[Hook: Macklemore]
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
Put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I remember that Freshman edition
Last year thinking to myself like
Yeah, nah, I won't win it yet, I probably won't get it, but
I'ma give it everything, play my position
The next 11 months I gave it all, everything I had in me
Left blood, sweat, tears in every god damn city
No label, no deal, no publicist, indie
Just music that connected and fans that rode with me
Throw me a gold mine, and a co-sign
While you're riding a couple dope rides
Two women, both dimes
Not gonna lie, that shit sounds so nice
But I got creative control, and my soul's mine
I wouldn't trade it, maybe I'm crazy
I put on for my city, Seattle, that raised me
Rule four-thousand-and-eighty, it's really not changing
Now a days make good music, the people are your label

[Hook: Macklemore]
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
Put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high

[Outro: Macklemore]
Oh my God
Feels like a victory lap
Can I have that moment
Can I talk my shit

[Interlude: Macklemore]
Now they say, "Don't forget where you come from
Don't die holding on to your words
Cause you know, that you got a whole world to change
But understand who you gotta change first"

[Outro: Macklemore]
Put 'em, up, up, up up
Up, up, up up
Put 'em, up, up, up up
Macklemore, Ryan Lewis
Put 'em up, up, up up
Up, up, up up
Put 'em, up, up, up up (so high)
