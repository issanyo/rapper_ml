[Verse]
I was just a backpack rapper, backpack of Krylon
Fat caps, slab of concrete that I would write on
Eighth grade when "Triumph" came out, and I'm like, "Hey mom
Can I skip school? I can't even wait!" "Nah!"
Thirteen years later, praise God
I just got DM by Raekwon
And he wants me up on the same song
And Method Man's pissed off for doing the crowd walk
But it wasn't nothing, man, we squashed it, nah
I'm from the city Nirvana where that mosh pit started
[?] from where Kool Herc started
That doesn't mean that I won't kill the beat and be a martyr
Aspestos with pencils my pens choke as coffins
West Coast, success toast, Seattle down to Compton
What does it say about America that I became a millionaire
Between kicks and snares and couldn't get in to college
Aight, switch topics
I don't walk I get piggybacks on Action Bronson
Show up at Em's crib with the split of vodka
Hit up Mac Miller, relapse and celebrate kwanzaa
On behalf of us white rappers
I think it's a fact that yes we have appropriated culture
It's just race, let's talk not make it awkward
I wrote a song about thrift shop's
I never thought it would ever get a spin, radio did its thing
And all of sudden the song popped up and got popular
Would that have happen if I wouldn't be a cracker?
Sold 6 millie, does skin tone really matter?
We live in America, land of gimmicks and ladders
And did I go climb it, bastard, of course race was a factor
But bitch I'm a B-boy and I put that beat in the casket
Listen to The Heist, man, we almost made a classic
You gon' agree, that's vantastic
Take away Thrift Shop and can't hold us going platinum
9 times, alright fine
But I made it uncool for kids to say "faggot"
I got rich and I didn't go buy a mansion
Gave away 200K to the homies that didn't have it
And when I fall off and the second album flops
And turn into Vanilla Ice, wait, that's never gonna happen
