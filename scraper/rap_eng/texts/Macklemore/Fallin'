[Intro: Stephanie Kay]
I look around me
But all I see is emptiness
How did i get here?
How did my life become a mess
I gotta change
I just can't do this anymore

[Verse 1: Elaine Sharp]
Remembering your words so cruel
And how they made me feel a fool
I'm not ashamed to say I cried
You hurt me, I'm not going to lie
What happened to this love of ours
I thought it was written in the stars
I always thought it was meant to last?
But the present cannot heal the past
Because I can't forget those words you said
They keep on playing in my head
Like a broken record stuck in a groove
Yet if I end it now, what will that prove?
Your apology was good to hear
But it didn't really stop my fear
That what we had is gone for good
So can I forgive you? I know I should!

[Hook: Macklemore]
I keep fallin', I keep fallin', I keep fallin', down the rain
Keeps pourin', keeps pourin', I don’t know if I can get up today

[Verse 2: Nate Monoxide]
The warmth from inside fogs the glass, obscuring my view
And I obsess over patterns I thought I knew
I'm learning to discern between what is and isn't there
The droplets I befriended have gone and I can't guess where
But I still hear the rhythm and I still love the rain
And I still miss the scent when it's all gone away
And I still don't remember but at the same time can't forget
I attempted to embrace each drop but all I get is wet

[Hook: Macklemore]
I keep fallin', I keep fallin', I keep fallin', down the rain
Keeps pourin', keeps pourin', I don’t know if I can get up today
(x2)

[Verse 3: b-Rabbit]
Feels like I've been here before
This isn't the first time I've awoken, passed out on the floor
Fallin' out the sky, crashing from my high
And I'm afraid that today could be the day that I die
But I fake a smile, I lie, "I'm fine"
In this dim life, I've never once seen the sun shine
Repressed memories have made me hard and cold
And although you see me laugh and smile, underneath I'm fucking depressed
Recently I've made my life a train wreck, a giant mess
So on this album I'm ready to address
My faults, get up off the wall
Tone down the verbal assault, I'm not crazy, I don't do bath salts
But my whole, entire existence is false
My heart has been shot
I'm lying in a puddle of vomit as my chest bleeds out
It's without a doubt, no one hears me when I shout
I can scream as loud as I want, nobody ever hears the sound
All I can hear is the rain as it pounds against the glass of the window to my soul

[Hook: Macklemore]
I keep fallin', I keep fallin', I keep fallin', down the rain
Keeps pourin', keeps pourin', I don’t know if I can get up today
