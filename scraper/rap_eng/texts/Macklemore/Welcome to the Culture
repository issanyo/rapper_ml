In life, seven going symphony
I orchestrate my music willingly
Like emus? making history
Mentally we’re manipulated by the music industry
It’s conference, chivalry, creativity, lyrically,
Step up and take a stand
But if you over-stand linguistically
Then represent
For it is evident that
The dead president is taking our culture out of its element
And my testament is to get it back
Take propaganda and insert facts
Starting a positive revolution within the rap, clash
And that’s vain called
Jewelry ice and money and women don’t mean a thang.
It’s a shame what we listen to
“In actuality it’s hurting who?”
Me and you
Originating a negative that America looks up to
And we think it’s cool, but in reality it’s whack
And the media associates hip hop with commercialized rap
I’m taking it back to the positivity, provocative productivity
Rebelling against this industry
Drop if it’s hot, drop it if it’s pop
Doesn't pop and lock? Then it really ain’t hip hop
So don’t cop it
But this is the only way that we are going to stop it
If they don’t make a profit
Then there won’t be a market
Do the math
Listen to the music that comes from the soul
Most quote/unquote MC’s are in it strictly for the bankroll
And have no mind control
Behold, when the trend ends, they get back
Silly bitchin for the check, what the FUCK did you expect?

Welcome to the culture
If you don’t know it’s called hip hop
If you knew, sorry for the review, but it looks like a lot forgot
We bomb cities, pop and lock
Spinning our records as we rock
To the beats on the streets kicked over a beatbox
Intellectual evolution
Consciousness distribution
Substitution soul speaking sound service is my solution
Strictly b-boy,
No decoy hot boy stuck in irrelevance
Hip hop prolonging the art
Bringing it back to the elements

Let’s get back to the basics
Step one, knowledge of self
If you don’t know yourself
You won’t be content with evil wealth
Many seek to find a peaceful state of mind
Assuming that finances verbalize?, but you walk the line?
Ignorance is bliss
Surprise
So if you are stuck on manatary? monetary mersany?
You will never learn that the best things in life rest eternally
I don’t put music out of my purpose
And my service
To my mental, well folk
Without it the other steps are worthless
Shining, shimmering light, despite
Counterclockwise movements
So I listen to my intuition and let my eternal ways, and release my inking in fluent congruent fashion
Pardon the provocative exceeding ear drum boundaries, I’m lasting
So the fakes get crossed out because we don’t need ya
I’m second cheese wannabe MC’s end up taste testing for Velveeta
Y'all some bitch-made
Paper-weight, deteriorate
On the couch ejaculate
I got to regulate
Innovate, operate, and never do SHIT
All you talkers make me sick
Thinking that smoking weed on your couch is gonna get you a record exec. on yo DICK, and
Get you a deal?
Look in the mirror and honestly tell yourself that you are Keeping it real
But you lying
Listen to your heart and hopefully you will learn
That your actions
Speak louder than your words

CHORUS X2

The drum of the heart was the start
The civilization to embark
So our art’s origin is the drum
Our cerebrum
Is our brain
Our body is the temple
And you treating that right, yo that’s essential
To yo mental
And I, wanna preach
But I figure MC’s have the power
And if they have the talent they can reach
Ya audience
Without displaying cockiness
Hopefully you gain insight to real but demo bumping' progress Of the occupants
Because this is rhythm
If it comes from the soul
Your skills shall unfold
And the truth shall be told
Bankrolls and hoes
Show cultural neglect
Let’s prolong this art
And show our culture respect
