[Sample: Macklemore]
Now he just wanted to act like them
He just wanted to rap like him
Us as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids

[Verse 1]
All we really want, each and every one of us is to be remembered in a million years
That’s why I live my life the best I can with no regrets and try to ignore all of these fears
Why is it when girls hook up they’re called sluts…but guys get hi fives for bustin their nuts
Should I rap more like this, should I rap more like that?
I should just rap as myself as a matter of fact
And that’s the reason I think Scotty’s wack
Cause he doesn’t seem to have depth on his tracks
And depth is all I seem to have left, cause so many sleepless nights all I’ve done is wept
And throw on some Eminem and pretend that I don’t wish my life would end
And my friends aren’t there so why do I even call them friends

But in reality and honesty, I’m probably a wannabe of possibly a prophecy cause constantly im commonly
…the one trying to live modestly when nobody else does
Most of the time I feel I’m the kid nobody else loves
And they say “oh Frankie wow I love him”
In my head I say “when was the last time you hugged him”
Cause that’s all I need to keep from breaking
But it gives me something to write, music making
Cause Kobe made 23 million in 2010
Where as we got parents who won't see their kids again
And yet as the same time that America sheds a tear
Ray rice is getting 9 mill a year
Cause he plays for the Baltimore ravens
Yet we still have “Food for the homeless foundations”
Education isn’t getting any funding
Yet we’re surprised when our kids turn out like al bundy

[Sample: Macklemore]
The fact of it is most people that rap like this talkin' about some shit they haven't lived
Surprise, you know the drill
Trapped in a box, declined record sales
Follow the formula violence, drugs, and, sex sells
So we try to sound like someone else
This is not Californication
There's no way to glorify this pavement

[Verse 2]
And that’s why I tell stories within all of my rhymes
Cause there’s parts of me within all of these lines
And I can bear my soul in each and every rap poem
The depth of who I am I’m trying to show them
There’s more to me than a half black kid who giggles
I speak through rhymes which speak through riddles
And to the haters I give these fingers in the middle
The concept of what I try to say is so simple
But in reality nobody really gives a fuck
They want something to roll their windows down and turn their system up
Well screw it I’m saying I’ll rap how I wanna
And be myself is what I am gonna
..Do and its nothing new or fresh
I’d rather be hated for what I am then fake and the best
The life I’m fearing… seems more like the life I’m nearing
And they say to face your fears but they shouldn’t be approaching…
How did I I get stuck in this spot, where music is all I got
And it’s a lot but it’s never enough
And when it comes down to it I’m trying to rap real stuff
Like the fact that the only that’s going up is the debt
And the amount of nationwide tragedies and death
And the kids under the influence of herion and meth
Because a home life is something they never met

[Sample: Macklemore]
I've seen my people's dreams die
I've seen what they can be denied
And "weeds not a drug" - that's denial
Groundhog Day life repeat each time
Cheatin' and lyin'
Friendship cease, no peace in the mind
Stealin' and takin' anything to fix the pieces inside
Broken, hopeless, headed nowhere

[Verse 3]
I come from a city where people have it so good
That to add excitement to their life they try to act hood
Being rude to cops and taking so many shots
That they are seeing spots by the time it’s 12 o’clock
And then they are drinking and driving
Barley surviving but the thing that is oh so surprising
Is that they’re doing well in school
Silly little fools, I know you’re drinking just to seem cool
And then the ones who are privledged are breaking all the rules
Yet still have the money to apply to 5 star schools
Did you know out of my graduating class
3 of the valedictorians had been caught straight passed
Out on the couch from drinking
And the thing that I am thinking
Is that America is great I really truly love her
But I’m thinking she isn’t really a mother
More like a little sister or brother
That takes everything they do wrong and cover
It up, to the best of their luck
Cover up anything that happened when they run amuck, That’s what’s up
You’d rather here a dope beat and some lines about sex
Well listen to the other 900 rappers who claim that they’re next

[Sample: Macklemore]
Thinkin' I would never do that, not that drug
And growing up nobody ever does
Until your stuck, lookin' in the mirror like I can't believe what I've become
Swore I was goin' to be someone
And growing up everyone always does
We sell our dreams and our potential
To escape through that buzz
Just keep me up, keep me up
Hollywood here we come
