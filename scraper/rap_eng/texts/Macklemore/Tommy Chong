[Verse 1 - Geo]
Ey. Whether you’re ballin or broke, wanna find The Most High just follow the smoke
Everybody wanna fly but nobody wanna know
How the whole thing started. Whenever you were born
Yeah go back farther deep in the jungles in the Ganges river: 2000 BC
See Hindus and Sikhs, shitloads of weed
Very first plant cultivated for the fabric
And anytime they burned it the people started dancing
Medicine man put the people in the trance that they transported west
Brought by brown farmers
Shared with the Rastas and said it’s called Ganja
Greeks and the Turks traded gold for dope
And soon Shakespeare smoked the shit and wrote dramas
Soldiers Napoleon led brought civilians stashes of hash, took it back to France with em
Christopher Columbus: first drug smuggler
Slaves made to grow his shit, but smoked some of it
To laugh at the master plotting his disaster
And everywhere the immigrant went he had a drag there

[Verse 2 - Geo]
I’m just stating the facts if I’m mistaken, my bad, I’m just the messenger
Spitting Wikipedia raps
I gotta Shawn Kemp in my pocket cutting in half is two Gary Paytons
Don’t ask do the math
I know cats who got killed for the sack who’d probably be alive if the market for that bama wasn’t bad
You put it in the hands of the many who mark territories in blood
Kind of scary, huh?
Ain’t even talking bout the ones with the badge
The ones still waging that war inside their head
The same ones who could probably use a couple hits
And I wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of fuckers did
Make you want to roll up a j and say “shit, I ain’t gonna be the one to get caught for doing this”
Cool, you gotta know the rules, how to live
You wanna find the loopholes, do what I say
As long as you ain’t got 40 grams in your hand, can’t get you with a felony (delivery intent)
But anything less than that’s a misdemeanor
And legally a reason for police to take seizure
Even with initiatives passed decriminalizing the green grass
They don’t wanna see that
Might as well get you a forever green pass
Hit that dispensary fast, believe that
This law’s so flawed
The foundation’s done
The more things outlawed
The more outlaws run
George Washington himself probably puffed the chronic
Now his face get exchanged for this shit, ironic

[Verse 3 - Macklemore]
I went to that Bob Marley stage, that ganja ganja
That one love brah, it’s a medicine that makes you stronger
Equated to me chilling, isolated in my apartment
Blazing an eighth a day and playing Grand Theft Auto
Like “Damn, I’m way more creative”
Twenty minutes later, staring at the paper
Yeah, and 4/20, it was all about the love
Now it’s 4:31 and I’m paranoid as fuck
Like “who are these hippies, and where are my real friends?
Why are you playing hacky sack in a field, Ben?
You need visine, your eyes are real red
Wiz Khalifa’s gonna fuck your girlfriend”
I’m not against legalization, not at all
I’m against glorification, you are not Snoop Dogg
Moderation, that’s the key
But the door’s unlocked
It’s up to you how you use it
Make the call, c’mon

So when you puff that, thinking that’s how it is
Blowing more trees than the northwest wind
Knowing that you’re six times as likely as them to do time if your skin tone is darker than his
The last thing that you want on your mind
But demand and supply is in command of your high, bruh
Hey, you listening? I’m trying to drop gems
“Ay yo shut the fuck up and pass that shit”
“Ok”
