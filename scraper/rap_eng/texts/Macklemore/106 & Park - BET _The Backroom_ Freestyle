[Macklemore]
Check it, now let’s get creative, mama, I made it
Been dope since Baby was kissing Wayne on Rap City: The Basement
No diss to Wayne, he’s my favorite, so stupid, write with these cadences
Looser with music like Lucifer using ultimatums
The greatest thrift shopper in the rap game, watch me
The don gotta abuse closed honkies, I’m buying sweat pants at the swap meet
Going to 106 & Park and kicking it with Rocsi
Studio’s a pita roll whenever I’m recording
I’mma be like Terrence, yo, let me borrow some Jordans
Let me wear ‘em for the weekend, if I crease ‘em where the toe is
I’m blaming Drake and Chris Brown like my bad, I’m out
Now roll in the bucket, going a hundred and bumping my own club hit
And that seven’s hitting like bumping school teachers back in the 80’s
We laid up, creating something, we make art from the heart
You can feel that in your gut and this is awesome
This coat I’m rocking, Hungarian tiger, nah, I’m lying
It’s probably just a possum, tell PETA to get the hell up off it
Man, I'm from Seattle where we show the world how to mosh pit, I’m spazzing
Ah, I messed up, looks like I’m playing these haters on the internet
Get all pumped in the comment section like no, I’m not a rapper that sucks
No, I’m just being me, something you never been good at once
Nah, listen, I’m sick, no factitious intent, I could rap better than rappers
In a fake British accent, I’m with Adele and we’re dry humping
Making out by a fence with a beautiful, big bone red head with breasts ah
Shout out to RCA, Geffen and Atlantic, Interscope, Universal
Every major left on the planet, the (producs?) gave us props
Like we’re daps and handshakes, trying to make money
Off the strength of our fan base and take a third of our merch
All that money you’re getting is reimbursed, now let’s do the math for a second
No, not now, never unless you’re giving us what we’re worth
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yeah right, this is my life, that’s like being in the cypher
And passing up on the mic, right? America, get prepared for October ninth
World Tour and our album, The Heist, BET, I’m gone
