[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Everything is gold, everything is equal
Posted on the porch just chillin', me and my people
Eyelids closed, gold sun shines on
The world’s coated in the gold Krylon, yay
And these days, days days, they never run away
Gold tints, shades, that block out that golden haze
Take all the gold from the pawnshop that lives behind the case
And g-g-give it away
When gold erupted from volcanoes in the heavens
And every shrine that existed in time melted
Tombs open, Dookie Ropes on the pharaohs
When everything is gold, who cares about the carats?
They say that gold's the skin of the gods
You can’t take the band-aid when you’re gone
Now I, now I-I-I, I’ll tip over that kiosk in the mall
As the sunset falls into tomorrow

[Hook: Eighty4 Fly]
Today we're feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
Today we’re feeling like gold
So fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Alright now, we open up
That car door, hop out, hope they notice us
Throughout society we been locked in that cobra clutch
More gold bottles, gold bottles, never sober up
Ditch Jesus, In Gold I Trust
I solemnly swear to wear my cross and stunt
Separate myself by stickin' out just because
That’s how you illustrate power and who you’re above
But nah, tonight we take it, take it, giving it back
Crack open the vault, let everyone mob in the bank
Take whatever they want, we party and give thanks
I've been rocking gold chains since P was in the tank
You only live once, you only live once
Watch Rick Ross give his Jesus piece to a bum
'Cause tonight, we ball, we ball, we comin’ up
Paintin' the globe gold, two steppin’ on the sun like

[Hook: Eighty4 Fly]
Like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Today we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Gold coins, gold phone, gold car
Costs at least 10 racks to get 16 gold bars
Gold rush, suck on my gold dust stuntin'
Under these gold trunks, that’s 2 golden nugget
Flyin' on the gold eagle, flier than the rest of ‘em
Past the Space Needle, golden shower on pedestrians
"Excuse me, that’s my bad, that’s my eagle and he shouldn’t have"
My eagle got hair, that motherfucker got a mullet bruh
And it’s gold, two girls gold brass
Loungin' on the water, feet in the gold sand
Sippin' on Orangina, arms around them both pants
They’re sippin' Olde English right out of a gold can
Two girls, gold spandex so pretty
That girl ain’t even gold, she just got golden girl titties
I’m kidding, everyone is gold in my city
You paint Betty White gold, even Betty White can get it
Get it, get it, get it...

[Hook: Eighty4 Fly]
Today we're feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh
So we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro: Eighty4 Fly]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
