[Verse 1: Xperience]
If it ain't fresh, then you ain't gettin' play in my tape deck
Way back, I used to rock the hat with the suede strap at ABC's
Bought my food from the Arabs
Played craps on corners where the OG's slang at
Cross colors, I'm the boss of the playground
Iesha on the nuts, cos I knew how to play house
The 8 oz. baby from '84 to grow up
Cleaner than my Easter suit was with my shoes buffed
Don't step on my new ones
These Reeboks beat blocks, you give 'em a few pumps
Baby, why your attitude, "boo boo"?
She came from a new school, and all I wanna do is my zoom zoom
My uncle stayed faded like crew cuts
But I was just too young to know the what's-what and the who's-who
'Round here, they could give a fuck if you got props
You get clowned for rockin' British Knights to the sock hop
The BK stood for "black kids," the hood was crackin'
And "Poison" was on everybody's tracklist
Spandex was in fashion, back then
And bad chicks had tracks in that lasted

[Hook]
Before CDs and Internet the kings was in effect
You fiends wasn't gettin' respect
Before mp3s and CD-Js, we pop in a tape cassette
Chain on my chest, I'm fresh

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Let's take it back, b-b-b-back to the days of AC/DC, Back in Black
Gimme a mullet, a 1984 Chevrolet
Alright, I'm lying, I was listening to rap
OshKosh B'Gosh, stone wash, so hard
Overalls hung, one strap on, one off
Eatin' on my cold lunch, grabbin' on both nuts
Mom I want a jheri curl, fuck this bowl cut
Ice Cube's got one
Quik in my Walkman
Blowin' on the cartridge
Hypercolor, awesome
Kube's in my pocket and I'm outta here
I'm bouncing and Sam Goody's not getting shit from my allowance
Day dreaming in class, know I'm zoning out and
Rosie Perez's titties are right where my mouth is
Who says that white men can't jump? They were hella wrong!
A'ight, they were right, but I was really good at tetherball
Before the days of getting drunk at kegs
We were bumping some Jodeci and dry-humpin' legs
That's right, I was born in the '80s
Pimpin', adventurous, tryin to bone my babysitter
House party?
Crackin'
Humpty dance?
Crackin'
Never find the baby, David Bowie, Labyrinth
Why don't you reminisce and bring it back, rap shit
Dodge Caravan, humpin' in the back, classic
