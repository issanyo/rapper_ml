[Verse 1: Dan Caplen]
Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty
When our hearts get broke

[Chorus: Jess Glynne]
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

[Post-Chorus]
Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
These days, these days
Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
Oh I know, I know
These days, these days

[Drop]
These days, these days

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Cigarettes in the ashtray
Reminiscing on those past days
I thought youâ€™d end up with my last name
But that changed
And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while
I start texting
Write a paragraph
But then I delete the message

[Chorus: Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen]
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days

[Drop]
These days, these days
These days, these days
