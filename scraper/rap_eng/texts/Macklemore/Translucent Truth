Blame it on the noise
Blame it on the toys
Blame it on three stripes
Mics the right of passage
For the b-boy
Consistent, twists, flips, licks
Quick was the switch
The record from the ritual typical lyrical same old skill bulllshit
Criticize all you want
Go ahead
But if everyone is taught to doubt the rap then this culture will inevitably definitely be dead
So do something, take action and then diss
For it’s people like you that are putting this art form in jeopardy questioning if it exists
It’s alive and well
Still breathing, still heating
The habitual like any creation or movement transcends nations
And it’s still teaching
Still reaching
With diverse and positive vibes
Ricocheting off the walls of venues
Keeping this culture alive
Crushing the lies
Thought it was gone?
Surprise
Obviously you missed the message
Ancient spoken tradition but musicians glisten on the stage
Cover the universal projector of the voice
As if they can dodge the artificial ecstasy craze sucking on nookies at raves

I have no patience for those who
Really do not know who
They are
And act a certain way because they feel like they’re supposed to
I remain close to
A chosen few who the spirit has spoke to
The God has been provoked soon
The faith will change their ways. X2

The journal is my sanctuary
Sacrilegious testimonies
Praisin' the powers crossed spiritually
Enhancing this ground globally
Kneeling on bended knee
Focused on the realm of thought chi
That will has
And will always take me to the peak of a pointical prophesy
Arrangement of voices
Accompanying the music in an engagement
Choir poet
To inspire the dreams delivering this eye as in embraced with
A message
Words and meaning nervous from the nectar fruit
Picked fresh off the tree ripe from the two bo six oh four sectors
Peace to Hector
Those who laid the foundation
Never broken the sea of friends
From start till death do us part eternally through eternity I feel
From front rows at shows to family meals
Rides and automobiles
Which have manifested from taking spills on training wheels
Our memories will last forever
And I couldn’t take with thought banks
To all of my friends
I’m looking forward to the future when I will forever give thanks
Those memories will last forever
And I couldn’t take with thought banks
To all of my friends
I’m looking forward to the future when I will forever give my thanks

Chorus X2

The energy flows from the cord to man
Women and children
Those who you have spent your whole life building a relationship with
Can end
As quick as a sandwich
Your trust melted
While drowning in betrayal and disbelief
You see who is really your friends
This world is full of selfish sapiens, slithering snakes
Who will take your trust, lure you with this bait
And sell you out for their personal sake
Built on hate, smiles and popular facades
Quick to stab you in the back with the object that you thought your relationship was built on
I got your back, and you got mine cuz we’re homies
Not need to greed and selfish needs
I question who really even knows me
Myself
And when I’m by myself
And I need someone plus myself
Will they sacrifice theirself to help?
Oh I see
If that’s the way it’s got to be
I guess I was a fool to assume that we’d be down until eternity
Oh I see
If that’s the way it’s got to be
I guess in the end the only person I can truly count on is me

Chorus X2
