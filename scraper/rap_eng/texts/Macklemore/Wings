[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I was seven years old
When I got my first pair
And I stepped outside
And I was like, "Momma
This air bubble right here
It’s gonna make me fly"
I hit that court
And when I jumped, I jumped
I swear I got so high
I touched the net, "Mom, I touched the net!
This is the best day of my life"
Air Maxes were next
That air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffing, the tread
In school
I was so cool
I knew that I couldn’t crease em
My friends couldn’t afford em
Four stripes on their Adidas
On the court I wasn’t the best
But my kicks were like the pros
Yo, I stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, book bag was so dope
And then my friend Carlos’ brother got murdered for his fours
Whoa
See he just wanted a jump shot
But they wanted his Starter coat, though
Didn’t wanna get caught
From Genesee Park to Othello
You'd get clowned for those Pro Wings, with the velcro
Those were not tight
I was trying to fly without leaving the ground
Cause I wanted to be like Mike, right
Wanted to be him
I wanted to be that guy
I wanted to touch the rim
I wanted to be cool
And I wanted to fit in
I wanted what he had, America, it begins

[Hook: Children Choir]
I wanna fly
Can you take me far away
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I’ll go so high
I’ll go so high
My feet won’t touch the ground
Just stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
We want what we can’t have
Commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn
I just got to flaunt it
Got to show em
So exclusive, this that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes
I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me
I’m a cool kid
I’m an individual, yeah
But I’m part of a movement
My movement told me be a consumer and I consumed it
They told me to just do it
I listened to what that swoosh said
Look at what that swoosh did
See it consumed my thoughts
"Are you stupid?
Don’t crease 'em! Just leave 'em in that box!"
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That’s my air bubble and I’m lost, if it pops
We are what we wear
We wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all
Will I stand for change
Or stay in my box
These Nikes help me define me
But I’m trying to take mine
Off

[Hook: Children Choir]
I wanna fly
Can you take me far away
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I’ll go so high
I’ll go so high
My feet won’t touch the ground
Just stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down

[Outro: Macklemore]
They started out
With what I wear to school
That first day
Like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am
What I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change
Consumption is in the veins
And now I see it’s just another pair of shoes
