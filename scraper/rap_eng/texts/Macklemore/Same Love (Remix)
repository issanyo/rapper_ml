Same Love Remix

VERSE 01:
Dear Mom, why do people care about my color?
I didn't mean for people to judge me like a cover
I never asked for these two complexions that I usher
Let's begin with the fucker that choked out Eric Garner
Or the boy who was killed walking down the street
Black lives matter more than these cops want it to be
Why can't my mom walk into a white neighborhood
Without being looked at or told where they should be?
He told his mom ''We will live in a better neighborhood, just wait''
But not even then is this family safe from the neighborhood watch
People so blind don't see that racism is alive but claim it's not
We just protest with proud 'Americans' waiting for justice
Please don't shoot?, put your hands up and salute
They shoot the ones that is shootin each other on them blocks
Not even knowin that is someone's little boy or girl
Wonder if they think of this every time of the night
The media just runs bunches of racism actin like it's all right
I ain't just a color, I am more than just that, I'm a human
Look closely and you'll see it.....but I don't know

HOOK: [Mary Lambert]
But I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm [x4]

VERSE 02: [Macklemore]
If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
"Man, that's gay" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're saying
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots
Behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate
Yet our genre still ignores it
"Gay" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That Holy Water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same but that's not important
No freedom til we're equal
Damn right I support it

HOOK:

VERSE 03:
Why is it this way, what is the cause?
Progress?, peaceful marches
With a evil over there eyes, they turn there back on our laws
'Til the day Ferguson can be peaceful without any cause
Blacks can walk down the street
Not scared to be ashamed
A world view in so much hate
Some would rather kill
Then fight there rights against the will
And a month of celebration
Isn't gonna solve it all
But maybe an apology is where to start
No man's gonna change us
We have to change us
Whatever religion you believe in
We all can be from the same one
Strip away the hate, beneath, we all are the same one
It's about time that we give love

HOOK:

OUTRO:
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays) [x5]
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays) [x5]
