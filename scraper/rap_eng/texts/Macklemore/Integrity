INTEGRITY

I’ll keep loose, keep steady
Stay on the right side of life
Be strong be ready
To defend myself and say why
When it matters, I’ll keep it simple
I won’t complicate what I know
I’ll be myself not a pretender
Then I won’t have to put on a show

My life’s just starting out
I’ll leave out the fear and doubt
Follow the future I dare to see
I’ll aim for the brightest star
Wait for my dreams to go far
Hold fast to my integrity
I’ll take my time, when I have a plan
Accept all the help I can get
When success comes I’ll be ready
Enjoy my time no regrets
I’ll ask advice from the people
Who don’t always say what I want to hear
They’ll be truthful. They’ll be honest
So, I’ll listen to them without fear
My life’s just starting out
I’ll leave out the fear and doubt
Follow the future I dare to see
I’ll aim for the brightest star
Wait for my dreams to go far
Hold fast to my integrity
I’ve a right to stay happy
Focus on the strength that’s inside
So I’ll smile, whenever I’m alone
Wear sense of purpose with pride
I won’t shut out the world outside
So life won’t always be about me
I’ll be prepared for the give and take
To aim for the future I see
My life’s just starting out
I’ll leave out the fear and doubt
Follow the future I dare to see
I’ll aim for the brightest star
Wait for my dreams to go far
Hold fast to my integrity
ANOTHER DAY IS OVER
Another day is over
The writing’s on the wall
It’s time to stop reflecting on
The dreams that made me stand so tall
Now I’m fully awake
And I’m standing on my feet
From now until tomorrow
The sun will be much colder
Than the one within my dreams
I love you so much that it hurts
I feel pain in my heart
I never knew that love would leave me
Standing alone in the dark
Now I’m feeling so empty
And there’s nothing left to say
So as you leave I’ll smile and wave
Then turn so you don’t see
My tear stained face
See our picture with me
Hold it in your head
And when the new day starts to dawn
On the painful tears that we’ve both shed
And I’ll begin all over
I will start to live again
Pretend a new beginning’s here
And dream a dream for which
There’ll be no end
I love you so much that it hurts
I feel pain in my heart
I never knew that love would leave me
Standing alone in the dark
Now I’m feeling so empty
And there’s nothing left to say
So as you leave I’ll smile and wave
Then turn so you don’t see
My tear stained face
So come a little closer
Please hold my hand once more
I’m scared to branch out on my own
It hurts to know you’ve closed the door
And I’ll take it upon myself
To recall what we once had
But when I look and you’re not there
I’ll hold my breath, fight back the tears
And try not to be sad
