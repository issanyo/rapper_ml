[Verse 1: Macklemore]
And she's like, "Can you undo my bra strap?"
I try to play it cool, in my head I'm like, "Aw yeah!"
Then she's like "I'm tired" and I'm like "Aw, man"
I was 'bout to crush the coochie like a tall can (Yeah)
Cause my girl's thick (thick!), she got a booty mane
And a big old belly looking like Gucci Mane
I keep my jewelry on, she love my dookie chain
Cause guess what! (what?) That's my boo boo thang. (who?)
My boo boo thang. (who?) My boo boo thang
She get too comfortable, bathroom door open when she boo boo-ing
I whisper in her ear, "Are you awake?"
Kissed her on her neck, said "Good night. You my babe."

[Chorus: Ryan Bedard]
Every time I go to sleep
I wish that you were next to me
Two people that were meant to be
Under the sheets
I'm spooning you, you're spooning
Every time I go to sleep
I wish that you were next to me
Two people that were meant to be
Under the sheets
I'm spooning you, you're spooning me

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Me and you, let's get lost in these bed sheets
At the very least press my D against your left cheek
She said Fifty Shades of Grey was the best read
I'm more of a Giving Tree type of guy, Shel Silverstein (He's awesome)
She keeps talking, might as well be in a seminar
I'm stuck, completely numb in my left arm
Her knees are bony, I need my homies
And that sounds weird, but I need my homies. (YUP)
You watched ahead on the fourth season of Game of Thrones? (Aw hell nah!)
I hold that against you (hmm mm!)
I want to forgive you, but inside I'm resentful
With your lame claims that we had different schedules! (we didn't!)
I've seen your Netflix queues, you're busted!
Can I even trust you, do you even know what love is?!
She put her hand on my D and started to rub it
All a sudden I succumb, say "Fuck it" and then busted (sleep tight)

[Chorus: Ryan Bedard]
Every time I go to sleep
I wish that you were next to me
Two people that were meant to be
Under the sheets
I'm spooning you, you're spooning
Every time I go to sleep
I wish that you were next to me
Two people that were meant to be
Under the sheets
I'm spooning you, you're spooning me

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Don't trip girl, you know I got you
Let's take it all off, no costumes
See I'm a man, but every now and then in bed I know when to say: "Alright, it's my turn to be the small spoon."
But tonight, I put my hands around your waist
Feel those little prickly hairs that you missed shaving your legs and say, "Good night my love, it's been one hell of a day."
And you reply, "I'm sleeping... space"

[Outro: Macklemore]
Every time I go to sleep
I wish that you were next to me
Two people that were meant to be
Under the sheets
I'm spooning you, you're spooning me
Spoon me
