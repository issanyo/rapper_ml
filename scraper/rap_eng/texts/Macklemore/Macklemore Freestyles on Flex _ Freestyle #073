I went from backpack rap, I thought that was the ceiling
Never thought my underground ass would touch a million
Wrist two tone looking like a fucking penguin
And tell PETA, yes, this is a plush chinchilla
I said woo
Being modest, Funk Flex the bomb threat
The music department rejected me in college
So shout out to my alma mater
You know I got a couple Grammies that y'all can borrow
Nah nah
I'm still winning, I'm still any, they still envy
Still directing fans, no labels trying to steal pennies
The white walls clean as hell and they still spinning
Still buying bootleg shit, this isn't real Fendi
I pop off, get topped off
My watch got us looking like bath salts, the bezzler's crack rocks
I wrote the playbook, no time to coach mascots
Get your ass out of here, that goes for all of y'all
Go politic at Comic Con, homie, knock it off
Got my own kid to raise, you are not my job
Mamase, mamamakusa, bumping Chaka Khan
The other day, and another dollar in my pocket y'all
Who told you I was falling off?
They lied to you, oh I'm booboo? No, not at all
I hit your city and get litty, hoo, problem solved
And throw a party with some cougars and some soccer moms
The champ, I come through, I slide through, I slam doors
Bench press arenas, and slam journeys, and dance sports
Crash course, the whip looking like transformers
Now I'm heading home cause Family Matters just ask Laura
Drop another one, oh my God, hold applause
Wanna kick you while you're on your way up, they so Solange
My compadres eating empanadas, all my folks is on
On the autobahn, pushing Maseratis like old cars
I'm so hot, I'm so damn hot could holler at the stars
Probably could have fucked a couple, kept my Johnson in my drawers
Don't want to box with God, competition? Not at all
Take my shirt off, take my rings off, and I holler World Star!
Tweet that link, you get DDT
Mollywhop your squad, BBD
Back in school I used to dream about this job, TNT
RIP Craig Sager, that's my fucking dog
And my suit game vintage, so Magic Don Juan
Hold up, if Jay or Ye is Jordan, and Kendrick is LeBron
And Drake is Westbrook, and Durant is Big Sean
That means that Cole is Curry, and Eminem is Bird
I'm not playing in the league to sit behind Dirk
I said, one ring?
Fuck that, I'm on my third
This is unseen, bust past rapping on first
I had one dream, to travel around the earth
With a 16, turn an arena into a church
Now can I preach to 'em, Flex?
They said one hit wonder, yeah?
Five platinum hits later, yes
And Gemini September 22, yes
