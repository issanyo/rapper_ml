[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game nope nope y'all can't copy
Yup, Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But, I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack
Fat cat, crushing labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothing
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah they can't tell me nothing
We give it to the people, spread it across the country

[Hook x2: MoMilli]
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Verse 2]
Now can I kick it, thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But thatâ€™s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Tell me go up, gone, deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome, Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never, ever did it for a throne, that validation comes
From giving it back to the people, now sing a song and it goes like
"Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching"
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility, and then we keep marching, I said

[Hook]

And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up

[Bridge x2]
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey-ee ay-ee ay-ee ay ay-ee ay-ee, hey
And all my people say

Na na na na, na na na na
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And all my people say

Mack-le-eh-eh-eh-eh-more!

[Hook]
