When I was young I had it all, yeah that was me.  Then one little problem happened changed everything.  All I wanted was it all then god had another plan for me yeah I guess he knows whats best for me.  You know Him always wanted the best for us never know it until your older but that's the way He works does all the things for us not knowing how not knowing when or knowing it all.  He is the only one that cares enough to save us all.  Yeah I guess you could say He is my best friend.  All the ways you can never know but He was the only reason so.
