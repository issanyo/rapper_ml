I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I, I, I'm hunting
Looking for a come up
This is freaking awesome

Walk into the club like, what up? I'm such a big shot
I'm so pumped, I bought some swag from the thrift shop
Ice on the fringe, is so damn frosty
That people like "Damn, that's a cold ass honkey"
Rollin' in, hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressin' in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, 'coz it smells like R.Kelly sheets

(But shit, it was 99 cents) Bag it!
Coppin' it, washin', 'bout to go and get some compliments, passing up on moccasins that someone else's been walking in
Bummy, grungy, eff it man
I am stunting, flossing and saving my money and hella happy that's a bargain
Imma take your grandpa style, Imma take your grandpa style
No for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs?
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket I found digging
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a ski blanket, and then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my Mello
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like Ah, he got Velcros

I'm gonna pop some tags

What you know about rocking a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowing about wearing a fur fox skin?
I'm digging, I'm digging, I'm searching through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donating that plaid
Button up shirt, I'm in here searching
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the opt bins
I'm not, I'm not, sick of searching in that section
Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
I will take those flannel zebra pajammies

They be like, "Oh that Gucci, that's hella tight"
I'm be like, "Yo, that's fifty dollars that ain't right"
Limited edition, let's do some addition
That shirt's hella though
And having the same one as six other people in the club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Trying to get them girls with that brand? Man, you hella won't

I wear your granddad's clothes, I look incredible
I wear that big fur coat from that thrift shop down the road
