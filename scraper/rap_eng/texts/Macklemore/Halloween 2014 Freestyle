[Verse]
You can't see me, I'm a don
You don't even wanna see my magic wand
I'm like "Poof" then you're gone
I'm the witch, wicked witch of the west shit
Fairy of the west shit
You know that I reign supreme from Seattle to Texas
I'm knocking on your door knob
Dropping off a bag of shit then I'm gone in my Lexus
You cannot see me the way that I go and flex this
I'm - aye - know I come into the function
If the party's wack then I'm smashing your pumpkin
