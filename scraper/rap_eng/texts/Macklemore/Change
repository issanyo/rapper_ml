[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I don't got time for meditation, nah
Don't got time to have a conversation with God
Don't got time for the congregation now, ah
I'ma put off liberation 'til tomorrow
Lord knows that I'm stuck in my ways
Out here expecting the rays
And do the same thing every day
Then expect it to change, yeah

[Chorus: Ben Abraham]
I used to say
I was never gonna change
But it rain
Water carry me away
Change
River is gonna run
Why am I afraid?
What am I hiding from?

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Can't take in the church, if I don't show up
If I don't do my job, I don't get the bonus
Don't wanna appear weak, if I don't know some
Can't find self if I'm afraid to no one
Can't critique the world if I can't take a critique
Can't blame my neighborhood if I don't clean my own street
Can't blame the drugs if I put the drugs in me
Can't expect others to change if I don't change me
Lord knows I ain't perfect
But 'til I put the work in
Success isn't destined, it's determined
By what you sacrifice for your purpose
But what's the purpose?
But what's the purpose?
Until they close the curtain
Put the work in

[Chorus: Ben Abraham]
I used to say
I was never gonna change
But it rain
Water carry me away
Change
River is gonna run
Why am I afraid?
What am I hiding from?

[Chorus: Ben Abraham]
I used to say
I was never gonna change
But it rain
Water carry me away
Change
River is gonna run
Why am I afraid?
What am I hiding from?
