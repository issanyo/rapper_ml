[Intro: Macklemore]
Yeah
"Rio" remix
Netsky, Macklemore
Ayy, ayy

[Hook: Digital Farm Animals]
Wherever she goes, I go, we roll, we go
Flying over cities down to Rio, it's real
Love that I feel, well nothing lasts forever
But I'm down for the minute so just chill
Wherever she goes, I go, we roll, we go
Flying over cities down to Rio, it's real
Love that I feel, well nothing lasts forever
But I'm down for the minute so just chill

[Hook: Digital Farm Animals]
Wherever she goes, I go, we roll, we go
Flying over cities down to Rio, it's real
Love that I feel, well nothing lasts forever
But I'm down for the minute so just chill
Wherever she goes, I go, we roll, we go
Flying over cities down to Rio, it's real
Love that I feel, well nothing lasts forever
But I'm down for the minute so just chill

[Verse: Macklemore]
It’s the “Rio” remix, you should see us
Swimming in the ocean like the pool is hella heated
Expedited Visa and I’m posted with my feet up
Parasailing over beaches, got my girl from Ipanema
I ain’t tripping if I’m mad blessed, nah
I’m a bossa nova Stan Getz
I… palm trees in the sandwich
Like girl, hell nah, we ain’t leaving the hammock
El Dorado panoramic, listen, I'mma use some spandex
Whispered something in my ear, I did not understand it
But I do not need to speak the language
She’s magic, pull a hat trick, freaky though
Supposed to go tomorrow, I know that I ain’t leaving though
Every day is Carnival and that’s that shit that we be on
I keep it on that need to know, posted on the front steps
Life goes by, Rio, Rio in the sunset

[Hook: Digital Farm Animals]
Wherever she goes, I go, we roll, we go
Flying over cities down to Rio, it's real
Love that I feel, well nothing lasts forever
But I'm down for the minute so just chill
Wherever she goes, I go, we roll, we go
Flying over cities down to Rio, it's real
Love that I feel, well nothing lasts forever
But I'm down for the minute so just chill
