[Intro: Grynch]
Yeah
Once you get a little age and Experience in you
You start viewing life from a whole other perspective
At least I do haha
Its like

[Hook: Grynch]
Sometimes I sit and think like if only
I had everything I wanted life would be bliss for me but
You gotta be grateful for what you can get homie
Cause somebody don't got nothing at all, Uh yeah

Sometimes I sit and think like if only
I had everything I wanted life would be bliss for me but
You gotta be grateful for what you can get homie
Cause somebody don't got nothing at all
No nothing at all

[Verse 1: C-Nik]
Ayo sometimes I sit and I think if only
I had everything I wanted life would be shit for me
Cause I wouldn't have to strive to survive I'd sit homie
It's the strife, the highlights the high points to life
It's a new today tomorrow so I think that I stand on my own two
Adjacent with the pavement and sand as I go through
My mazes on my path as a man, I can hope to and
Blaze on the mic with my glass hands shit and
I be rocking till' my clocks stop and my block drops
To the center of the earth with the hot rocks
Yo its a long shot, but I got a long time
They said Grynch was a dreamer but he's doing just fine
So why should I, wait for my moment of truth
While I'm still bathing in the fountain of youth
I'm blessed by the lord yes, I thank the skies
Everything's out of the question but, can I try? shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I wanna be signed, I wanna be famous
I wanna gleam in those lights that make us
So bright that we forget what has shaped us and
That's the struggle and the fight for greatness
I check the check we state and whatever we survival
Go into debt and attempts it lookin' just like our idols
Self esteemed marketing, self our self consciously
We measure our self worth by other people's property
You get it, you got it, you want it - that's the summer life
Being in a coffin and waitin' to get my money right
It's not sustainable, if you believe in that dream
Their selling in HD then homie they're playing you
I'm not saying I do get play too
But at the end I paint the picture and I get to choose the hue
To every time that I forget I come back to that truth
And I accumulate it on the pad right to this booth, come on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Grynch]
Now i'll be honest sometimes I take a lot for granted
With out thinking like, what if these seeds had not been planted
In my life its like I don't appreciate
What I got till its gone I gotta stop for real its wrong
These days I'm trying to do right and be a better person
And keep my love ones close man I would never hurt them
The good things In life they not gon last
It's been a hard lesson learned ever since Bob Dog passed, shit
Sometimes I feel like I'm loosing my fate
So I sit back and twist a cap on a brew to escape
Just tryna find a way out to numb the pain
Lost in the wilderness tryna find shelter from the rain
But, lately I felt that maybe I'm selfish
Sometimes its to the point where I can't even help it
Grew up an only child a spoiled brat
It coulda stayed that way, but sell dignity foiled that
So I'm gonna take this time out to speak for my soul
To everyone I know and love there's something I need you to know
I ain't ashamed or embarrassed to say this under my breath
It be a motherfucking crime y'all I love y'all to death
So when the going gets rough I think it could be worse for me
My mother almost died when she was giving birth to me
So charish every step, and cherish every breath
And maybe one day you'll see one day day that you're very blessed yup

[Hook]
