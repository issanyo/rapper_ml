[Intro: Professor Macklemore]
Hey, how you doing?
Man, I'm loving life right now
I'm just looking out the window and just thinking
"Look at where we live at,"
I mean this is the Pacific Northwest
This is the Almighty Kingdom
Fools be tripping like
"I'm gonna go here, I'm gonna go there"
I mean go ahead and travel
But just know
There ain't no place like the fresh coast, man

[Hook: Professor Macklemore]
We’re psilocybin spoken word carriers
Message translators
And debaters soul saviors
Sending positive vapors through the microphone to your eardrums
The movement’s through music
In tune with the almighty kingdom. X2

[Verse 1: Professor Macklemore]
I was born on this earth
A child of the sun rays
Lifted by the hands of the sand and
Ever since the first day, I saw a doorway
And eventually made my entrance
Embarked on what happened to become my fortress
The first sentence. In the ever glowing paragraph
Using words to communicate with the life forces that I call my mom and my dad
A continuous family tree
Blossoming with me in the middle of fate, destiny, and reality
As I proceeded to grow
I met my love on the radio
And knew that I had to be down with the Knights of the Round Table
At the age of 13, began to work out my flow
Met Mind Control
And a year later pulled the sword from the stone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Professor Macklemore]
This is the land of the enchanted
Mesmerizing beauty surrounds this planet that’s taken for granted
I see it every day
As poison unfortunately is force fed upon the face of the human race
Leading to the decay
Of this ground that we walk on
As an organic emperor I have started on a continuous thought song
The melody’s moisture rains in my brain
His mind remains soothed by the way that this music plays
Feeling the force of the melodic texture
Harp strung
Heart sprung
Toward a medieval adventure
Those inspired can attend a lecture
Kings of the continuous casper?, from now until November

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Professor Macklemore]
Feeling freedom
Talk as I walk
Embark on the meadow of thought with the plot
On the future that changes
My reason rearranges
Leaving lackadaisical phases conquering the mazes
Of confusion
Mind over matter
Climb the ladder
Find and gather
The knowledge of life
A plot
To music, and use it
Fluent with my words
Curves
Turns
Swerve
Urge
And learn
The access
Apply it to grammatics
Concentrate on your mindstate
Spit licks and practice
What you preach to each
For we have this, gift of life
Now it’s up to you to find happiness

[Hook x2]
