[Hook]
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Will you come party with me in my
Castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle?

[Verse 1]
This is for the freaks and for my magicians
Booty clap and lap dancing technicians
Dance parties in the name of Great Britain
And American girls who love the Detroit Pistons
Like Dennis Rodman, I got a rod man (awww yeah!)
Long wong-dong in a soft hand
And a pink palm pink schlong, let's all dance!
From England to Stockholm
I'm wearing a cape just like a poncho
I got a cutey and I'm making a beat on her booty
Like I was at Bonnaroo beating up on a bongo
I got a bottle of Martinelli's and I'm dumping
All over anybody that's kicking it in the grotto
Neighbors keep tripping, I'm like, "I'm in a castle
Fuck your condo!"

[Verse 2]
You like to party, I am a party-er
You like to wander, I am a wanderer
Your thighs are the closet to Narnia
Is it cool if I go and get lost in that?
I'm the lion, the witch in the wardrobe
Massage my lap, I have a sore bone
Of course cold on the dance floor
Like an Eskimo's toes in the North Pole
With both toes poking out of two holes
In the Eskimo socks, I'm hot
Like a cauldron from a warlock
Wearing sweatpants in a sauna
Who's your father? I'm not
I'm motherfuckin' Raven Bowie and here's my cock
Rooster, cock-a-doodle-doo sir
Take a hit of the hookah, now make it drop
Girl's booty was bigger than the stomach of Rick Ross'
Holy mother mountain of tender tendon to get lost in
Bounce, bounce, that castle booty, that bottom
Make it wobble, wobbly-wobble 'till my third leg has to hobble
You don't want to look back on this night
And think I should have been freaking on a booty
Freak-freaking on a booty

[Interlude]
This might be the best night that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had together
Eh, motherfuckin' eh

[Bridge 2]
Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of a party
In the night, in the middle of a party
Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of the night
In the middle of a party
Brought it home and threw it on the carpet
Someone kill a coyote, I'm starving
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Grab your bagpipe, I grab my flute
Cause drunk King John is still in the loo
Get onto the pole in a birthday suit, our suit
And M.J. was King, and Prince was Prince
And Raven has ruled ever since
