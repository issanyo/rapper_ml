[Hook: J-Doe]
Everything that I've been doing lately
Everything that I've been doing lately (yeah)
So I can roll up in a new Mercedes (skrr)
I can roll up in a new Mercedes (skrr)
Tell them boys that I said, "fuck you, pay me" (fuck 'em)
Tell them boys that I said, "fuck you, pay me" (fuck 'em)
Caused I just rolled up in a new Mercedes
I just pulled up in a new Mercedes (skrr, skrr)

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
KT stunna, I was born to drive the four hundred
Drive me a train, watch your boy
Swoop lane to lane in the coupe, drop
Excuse me for dropping my top
Drop my top on a porsche
High school used to play sports
Then I got fat and lazy
And luckily my pockets did too
Go and get the house, with the snipers on the roof
I can do the most, watch your boy ball coast to coast
Frost bite on all my chains
One-point-three on the diamond ring
Four-point-two, if we talking 'bout the house
Codeine castle is the aerial assault
Lilac purple on the butterscotch couch
I could smoke more only took a half an ounce

[Hook: J-Doe]
Everything that I've been doing lately
Everything that I've been doing lately
So I can roll up in a new Mercedes
I can roll up in a new Mercedes
Tell them boys that I said, "fuck you, pay me"
Tell them boys that I said, "fuck you, pay me" (yee)
Caused I just rolled up in a new Mercedes
I just pulled up in a new Mercedes (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
This summer I played like ninety shows (ninety shows)
It's time to spend some now I suppose (I suppose)
House in the hills cause that's how it goes
Moving in moving trucks moving down windy roads (skrr)
First night decided I threw a little function
Next door called the cops said, "there's been a disruption"
Thought I might just have some people over (people over)
Twenty five hoes and I'm sleeping over (sleeping over)
Oh boy, true, true yeah I gets cash, yeah I just smash
I'm finna spend what I just stashed
Throw a rolex on my wrist flash (bling)
Breaker, breaker on the dispatch
G-Eazy and RiFF RAFF
Are now on the run with drugs and hoes
Someone got a bitch snatched, roger

[Hook: J-Doe]
