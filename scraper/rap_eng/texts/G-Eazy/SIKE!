[Intro: Marty Grimes]
Yeah
Yeah

[Chorus: Marty Grimes]
Fresh bouncing out the coupe
I'mma take her if she choose
Spent a bad for the shoes
Yeah money looking right
Make her bend like rules
Like them in twos
She ain't fucking with her dude
Told her, "Come spend the night", Sike!
Yeah, Yeah I only fuck with you (Sike!)
Yeah Yeah, Aye
Yeah I only fuck with you (Sike!)

[Verse 2: P-Lo]
Only Only fuck with you
You can't even lay down at my, crib
Ain't nobody there how I did
Sauce like boiling crab with the shrimp
Whole shebang know the gang
Tell me that I own the bay
My way the only way
Lames all they know is hate
But I am not amused by them
They not my friends, not the one who follow trends
I do not miss, yeah

[Chorus: Marty Grimes]
Fresh bouncing out the coupe
I'mma take her if she choose
Spent a bag for the shoes
Yeah money looking right
Make her bend like rules
Like them in twos
She ain't fucking with her dude
Told her, "Come spend the night", Sike!
Yeah, Yeah I only fuck with you (Sike!)
Yeah Yeah, Aye
Yeah I only fuck with you (Sike!)

[Verse 2: Marty Grimes]
Told her I could take her top side
Out here flexing like Popeye
Hella gas, Hella drive
Keep her hella wet, Never dry
What I do do big big stunts
Smoking on big big clouds
Lifestyle been on Klumps
If I'm drunk enough I might plow
All this gold on my wrist
Make her want to creep with a nigga like me
You gotta leave
Sorry Babe Can't be sleeping all on my sheets
No games, no jokes, you came I poked
Got her whipped no rope
Ima bounce when it's over

[Chorus: Marty Grimes]
Fresh bouncing out the coupe
I'mma take her if she choose
Spent a bag for the shoes
Yeah money looking right
Make her bend like rules
Like them in twos
She ain't fucking with her dude
Told her, "Come spend the night", Sike!
Yeah, Yeah I only fuck with you (Sike!)
Yeah Yeah, Aye
Yeah I only fuck with you (Sike!)

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
I told her I'll bring her on the tour
If she's down to ride though
I told her I would bring everywhere
Everywhere that I go
I told her I really cared about, and she's really mine though
Yeah I told her a whole lot of things bruh, but I was lying though
Yeah, and it's still fuck fake friends
I don't speak, don't shake hands
Diamond grill cost eight bands
Treat Celine's like ray bans
L.A. is so cray fam
Town of Botox and fake lips
Big booty and spray tans

[Chorus: Marty Grimes]
Fresh bouncing out the coupe
I'mma take her if she choose
Spent a bag for the shoes
Yeah money looking right
Make her bend like rules
Like them in twos
She ain't fucking with her dude
Told her, "Come spend the night", Sike!
Yeah, Yeah I only fuck with you (Sike!)
Yeah Yeah, Aye
Yeah I only fuck with you (Sike!)
