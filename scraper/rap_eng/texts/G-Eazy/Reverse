[Intro]
Mello made it right

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Aston Martin, push-button motor (Yeah)
Migos on the ice (Yeah), anti-sober
Go, oh, oh, don't get hurt
Turn around and throw it in reverse (Whoop)
Let me see how you work
You boys smokin' dirt (On Gelato), we smokin' Larry Bird
Saint Laurent straitjacket, go berserk
Turn around and throw it in reverse

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
DB11, it's a 'vert (Skrrt skrrt), it goes skrrt
Keep her panty droppin', ridin' shotgun like she Kurt
Weavin' through the traffic with my ratchet in the purse
In a Saint Laurent straitjacket, if I crash, I go berserk
Overseas I need a visa, breezin' in Ibiza
Tryna' see me when I'm speedin', you get burnt like Derek Jeter
And my Nina, she's a diva, purty like Lupita
Peter Piper, pick a pussy, make her peck my millimeter
Chilly on the chain but the seats is heated
Shawty wanna race like I been believin', spent 3 G's on the sneakers
Like three stripes and a slash, I'm undefeated
Rick Owens, I'm tip-toein', push button, Kim Jong
Rode through lookin' so cool in a old school like Vince Vaughn
Vroom, vroom, nitro, hit the turbo
Pour that Ace of Spades up, we don't want no Merlot
Cop the coupe, drop the roof, hop out the top like I'm a turtle (ooh)
Then she turn around and throw it in reverse though

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Aston Martin, push-button motor (yeah)
Migos on the ice (Yeah), anti-sober
Go, oh, oh, don't get hurt (Watch out)
Turn around and throw it in reverse (Whoop)
Let me see how you work
You boys smokin' dirt, we smokin' Larry Bird
Saint Laurent straitjacket, go berserk
Don't get hurt, turn around and throw it in reverse

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, bend that ass over, throw it backwards
Moonwalkin to the pussy like I'm Michael Jackson (Oh)
Make a film with your bitch, turn into an actor (Ah)
Shimmy ya and then she ate a pill after
I get clothes from Vaccarello, I get CÃ©line from Slimane
I get packages from Paris, drop that Fed-Ex, sign my name
I get runway off the runway to the runway on the plane
Told you we are not the same, see that Spyder switchin' lanes?
Give it some gas, look at the dash, what is he doin'? He goin' fast
Look at the whip, look at him smash
Look at him skrrt, look at the cash
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a man that's gone insane
He's onstage in a straitjacket, this is not a game
Yeah, lit like a candle, I been too much to handle
This velvet jacket's fragile, 'Kay, be careful when you handle, please
(Why did you touch me?) Yeah, your hands look kind of dusty
Please be careful how you touch me, in Paris, out the country, ayy

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Aston Martin, push-button motor (Yeah)
Migos on the ice (Yeah), anti-sober
Go, oh, oh, don't get hurt
Turn around and throw it in reverse (Whoop)
Let me see how you work
You boys smokin' dirt, we smokin' Larry Bird
Saint Laurent straitjacket, go berserk
Don't get hurt, turn around and throw it in reverse

[Outro: Vic Mensa]
Turn around and throw it in reverse
Don't get hurt, turn around and throw it in reverse
