[Intro]
Slap Doctorz, SD
It's AB, GE, and Priceless, my G
This is the top of the game
Hear me out
We got [?] with this one though
The Epidemic, boy it's sick

[Verse 1: AB of Slap Doctorz]
I'm a goon motherfucker
Welcome to me casa
My moneystack is higher, higher than NASA
Hot as the devil, someone get the pastor
We gon' get ya boys but I don't play for Tampa
We smoke to the point where we get asthma
All red Bugatti, we call that Santa
All black Jag, now they think I play for Panthers
And I'm the shit so call ya boy Pampers
I am sick like cancer, boy I'm ill
Sippin' on promethazine, off one pill
I'll aim at your [?] with the Ruger
No Robin Thicke, but ya boy is a shooter
Match-made swag, I'll knock ya hat off
And my [?] be on your head like dandruff
Pop the trunk
But do you lames, that's my hood, I'm good
Ballin' like Chris Paul or Hardwood
Le-le-le-let's go

[Hook: G-Eazy]
This is your answer if you questioning me
I'ma be what I'm destined to be
On top of the game
And if they mad, tell 'em send 'em to me
I'ma show 'em why I'm next up to be
On top of the game
You never be what you pretendin' to be
I'ma show 'em why I'm next up to be
On top of the game
Expect me to do exceptionally
I'ma show 'em why I'm next up to be

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Even when the flow was exquisite
Want us to the Bay, ask around for me on your next visit
'Cause I'm the best with it, and yeah I really live it
I'm on top of the game like I'm having sex with it
I followed how the best did it and I learned this
Do hard work through the dirt, man, you earned bliss
'Cause most of you start hot but then turn piss
'Cause you don't burn no boobs you only burn discs
Eye lids wide, I swear it's like I'm livin' dreams
Every night I'm on stage, all the women scream
And how I made it out the red, now I'm in the green
And how my money stretch long like a limousine
Grindin' 'til the last spot's gone
My album's where you find hot singles like match.com
Now all these labels tryna hold me down like Saddam
'Cause they know I'm 'bout to blow up like a bomb

[Hook: G-Eazy]
This is your answer if you questioning me
I'ma be what I'm destined to be
On top of the game
And if they mad, tell 'em send 'em to me
I'ma show 'em why I'm next up to be
On top of the game
You never be what you pretendin' to be
I'ma show 'em why I'm next up to be
On top of the game
Expect me to do exceptionally
I'ma show 'em why I'm next up to be

[Verse 3: Priceless of Slap Doctorz]
They let me in the loop, so it's time to knock it
Makin' money is my job, I ain't never clockin' out
I'm just waiting, see his faith that I get it
I don't talk about the game, my nigga, I just live it
Off the top, my delivery kills it
Top of the game and you niggas lookin' like midgets
If the fast lane verse has been left you bruh
I eat emcees like Hannibal Lecter
Come hard, it's my nature to make hits
To the top quick, talking 'bout you like you ain't shit
I'm bilingual, real, and money talks
So if you ain't speaking neither, might as well walk
I laugh at you lame cats, say you doin' this and that
Full-grown but you lookin' like a pussycat
Chain full of yellow stone, pockets full of green time
Baller status, nickname should be Lemon Lime

[Hook: G-Eazy]
