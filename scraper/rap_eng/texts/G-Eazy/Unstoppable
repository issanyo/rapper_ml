[Intro: Charlie Dimes & G-Eazy]
Yea it's motherfucking Charlie Dimes in the building baby
It's been a minute, G-Eazy, I fuck with you baby
It's the Sikkis on the Planet, G-Eazy
But theres been a lot of hate going on
Feel me, aye but it's all love though I appreciate all of it

[Hook: G-Eazy]
So you could hate me or you could love me
Either way you are still thinking of me
You can diss me and talk 'bout me
You just adding fuel to my fire if you doubt me
Unstoppable, Unstoppable
Unstoppable, Unstoppable
Unstoppable, Unstoppable
Unstoppable, Unstoppable

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
See they hate on you when you do something now
They hate on you when you do
What you think they want you to
What everybody else do just steppin' in but that ain't you
And that ain't cool
My conclusion is they hate you when you do
When you do anything with your life
That stands out above the norm
Forgive me but see I can't fit the form
I came for them because a normal life for me is boring
I been this way thats how I stay cause thats how I was born
Was born to go hard like a savage
Go out and get my cabbage
Go and grab it like a rabbit
Grind until my life is lavish
I'm not your average Joe
A beast if you have to know
Stay lifted blowing trees
Smoking like a Navajo
Fuck an eight I grab an O
Fuck that booboo pass the dro
And if you don't know who I be's than ask your ho
Now there shes at but keep it real
If you keep it 1-0-0
And if you've seen me at a show
The bitches really love me bro

[Hook: G-Eazy]
So you could hate me or you could love me
Either way you are still thinking of me
You can diss me and talk 'bout me
You just adding fuel to my fire if you doubt me
Unstoppable, Unstoppable
Unstoppable, Unstoppable
Unstoppable, Unstoppable
Unstoppable, Unstoppable

[Verse 2: Man-Man]
I'm colossal, I'm unstoppable, phenomenal
Got these haters mad cause I switch it up like audible
My money stackin' up got these haters mad as fuck
Cause when they hear me on a song they be like
"Oh god damn he nuts"
Doctors who I'm fucking with but who fucking with us?
I've been rapping since like 8 years old and still ain't giving up
And the team I'm with the greatest but these haters call it luck
At the bottom of the rap chain but now I growing up
I go monster when I get on beats cause I just rip them up
And G-Eazy put me on this shit so to him I give big ups
And these bitches they be on my dick cause I be built and stuff
Now guess what?
I'm next level and they digging me like shovels
I think I'm on a roll man I'm hotter than tea kettles
This sreets settle, I get down
Other niggas just like clowns
And these songs that I get on I be busting like a pistol
Yea I'm sick, I'm contagious I might die if I kiss you

[Hook: G-Eazy]
So you could hate me or you could love me
Either way you are still thinking of me
You can diss me and talk 'bout me
You just adding fuel to my fire if you doubt me
Unstoppable, Unstoppable
Unstoppable, Unstoppable
Unstoppable, Unstoppable
Unstoppable, Unstoppable

[Verse 3: Charlie Dimes]
You ain't never seen a dude with swag like me
I'm here from the Bronx I'm so N-Y-C
And I'm so real I wear a T to a ball room
I'm a hustler I sign them over to an orphan
My whole conscience got my pocket going green
And I don't eat rappers cause I don't eat me
And I rip the beat when I MC
And you've never seen a lyricist like me
Cause I, I been, I been around the world
I got blood diamonds and oceans pearls
I'm genetically fresh but I quench my thirst
And I'm so so sick, man I gotta be cursed
By a, Voodoo witch in Louisiana
Don't talk that shit, don't know the grammar
I smoke that shit that marijuana
My bad I meant to say marijuana

[Hook: G-Eazy]
So you could hate me or you could love me
Either way you are still thinking of me
You can diss me and talk 'bout me
You just adding fuel to my fire if you doubt me
Unstoppable, Unstoppable
Unstoppable, Unstoppable
Unstoppable, Unstoppable
Unstoppable, Unstoppable

[Outro: Charlie Dimes]
What up New York? Cali I see you
We out here man my man G-Eazy, You cool for that
And of course it's your man Charlie Dimes
And all you fucking haters, we're laughing at you
We getting money, fucking bitches, making music
What else is there to do, fuck with us
G-Eazy you a fool for this beat
Slap Doctors where you at?
