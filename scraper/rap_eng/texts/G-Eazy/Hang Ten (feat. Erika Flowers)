They-they say I'm too old for my age
But it's funner to act younger
I'm such a fucking stunner
And that's word to my mother
Y-y-you say it's always cloudy where you are
Well that's a bummer
Cause it's always sunny over here
Welcome to endless summer
Hang ten
Hang ten
H-h-hang ten
Hang ten
N-n-now where haven't we been

It's always sunny in New Orleans
Where we kick it everyday
Said she's wit' it, well okay
Let me hit it, let me slay
When I make a lot of scrilla
We gonn' split it everway
Between my team and I, okay
Let me get this underway
See I'm young and I'm not trippin'
I'm on some Jack, I'm sippin'
And at midnight we might break into a pool for skinny dippin'
After that I won't mean water when I say this girl is drippin'
And I won't mean gymnastics when she is flippin'

They-they say I'm too old for my age
But it's funner to act younger
I'm such a fucking stunner
And that's word to my mother
Y-y-you say it's always cloudy where you are
Well that's a bummer
Cause it's always sunny over here
Welcome to endless summer
Hang ten
Hang ten
H-h-hang ten
Hang ten
N-n-now where haven't we been

Man this beat is bananas
Off the chain is off the hanger
I've got chemistry with jive
Man this shit sound like a banger
I get bitches to pose nude for me
However I'm no painer
But if she don't go down
I kick her out that's a no brainer
This life is hella fun
I can't imagine anything toppin' that
Lookin' for me you can find us wherever it's poppin' at
Ever since the day, I caught the mat, to drop the track
I've been goin' hard and they jockin' that

They-they say I'm too old for my age
But it's funner to act younger
I'm such a fucking stunner
And that's word to my mother
Y-y-you say it's always cloudy where you are
Well that's a bummer
Cause it's always sunny over here
Welcome to endless summer
Hang ten

H-h-hang ten
