[Bridge]
What does it mean?
Girl I said, what does it mean?
When I come at you but you turn it down
When I know you’re down for me
What does it mean?
Girl I said, what does it mean?
When I come at you but you turn it down
When I know you’re down for me

[Pre-Hook]
(Oh yeah) Rollin’ with me for the day
You can just lay up on my bed
Be on display, you won’t believe how we stayed up so late
Doing things other couples can’t relate
Saying things you normally wouldn’t say
Agressive and gentle I know that’s your favourite
Girl I can tell that you’re dangerous

[Verse 1]
Better stay late wait ‘till the guests leave ya
We can have an after party I know
That I been so patient you been so patient
I see you hardly, oh
I hope after tonight is done you can text him and tell him is over
I hope after tonight is done you can text me tomorrow “come over”
Making these memories we can re-tell to our friends when we older
On the weekends we go to a party and take all these shots like we soldiers
On a bed get you wetter than ever then kiss on your shoulder then I make you “ah”
Please do not leave me girl, all of these feelings I’m feelin’ have only begun

Yeah, Eazy

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star
Out in Vegas or a little bar
It’s really not a difference if it's near or far
Listen, here we are; need you
I've always wanted what was off limits
Staring at you 'til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this is all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we can tell that there are changes coming
See, I can tell that you’re a dangerous woman
That means you're speaking my language, come on
Now follow me, let's go
Like Penelope in Blow
Well aware that stealing you is a felony, yeah I know
That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah

[Pre-Hook]
(Oh yeah) Rollin’ with me for the day
You can just lay up on my bed
Be on display, you won’t believe how we stayed up so late
Doing things other couples can’t relate
Saying things you normally wouldn’t say
Agressive and gentle I know that’s your favourite
Girl I can tell that you’re dangerous

[Hook]
Good girl but I know deep down you dangerous
Good girl but I know deep down you dangerous
Good girl but I know deep down you dangerous

[Bridge]
What does it mean?
Girl I said, what does it mean?
When I come at you but you turn it down
When I know you’re down for me
What does it mean?
Girl I said, what does it mean?
When I come at you but you turn it down
When I know you’re down for me

[Verse 2]
Baby I’m honest
Baby I promise
I know my reputation is not too astounding
Girls like you they ain’t really too common
I know right now ain’t really good timing
But everytime I’m with you everything is timeless
Everytime I’m with you I wanna rewind it
I’ll get you three rings like damn you a binder
You say you love him got a feeling that’s a kinda
And I’m kinda in love
I’m counting on you, counting on us
I’m counting on trust
Never counted for love

[Outro]
And I’m kinda in love
I’m counting on you, counting on us
I’m counting on trust
Even thought I know you know you dangerous
