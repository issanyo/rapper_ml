[Verse 1: Quincy]
She break it down, take it down, put it down
For me every day
The way she moves her hips from side to side
She got me put my phone away
She got everything you wanted more
The way I wanna ohh it’s just so scandalous
She likes being the center of attention
Did I mention that this girl was from Los Angeles?
She was born in America but I call her my…

[Verse 2: Quincy]
I pull up, she roll up, she turn up
She don’t waste no time
Now I get you there all alone
Hoping I can make you mine
She got everything you wanted more
The way I wanna ohh it’s so scandalous
She likes being the center of attention
Did I mention that this girl was from Los Angeles?
She was born in America but I call her my…

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Well, so imagine it’s 4AM in downtown Los Angeles
I’m throwing ones fall in love with every dime
She’s looking at me I fall for it every time
And she’s the baddest here won’t go for a different kind
Want some brain cause there’s nothing more important in the mind
I’m watching amazed the way she ride the pole
Got it you sold me on that private show
And she’s from L.A, I said I’m from the O
3 songs play she ask me do you got time for mo?
I said why not?, eyes, locked
Spending all the cash I know that I’ve got
I hit the ATM grab a serious amount
Hour later grab more I think I’m clearing my account
I know in the morning nothing out made sense
Spent it all in the strippy don’t know how I’ll pay rents
But fuck it, it was money well spent that’s what I
Say to myself she's the one call her my
