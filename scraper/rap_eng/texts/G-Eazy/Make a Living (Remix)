[Intro: IamSu!]
She gotta have some money she could spend on
I made this beat
Shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: IamSu!]
You just gotta tell me what you into
We could take a trip and bring your friends too
I'll do this shit forever if I wanted
You just gotta have some money you could spend on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You gotta have some money you could spend on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You just gotta have some money you could spend on

[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
Look, me and Su run the same chicks
East Oakland to the Rich no look assist
Curry for the three in the clutch time
In high school you was eatin' free in the lunch line (broke nigga)
Your main bitch in my DM (is that right?)
She said she like the candy paint on my BM (foreign)
Single baby mother like Blacc Chyna (like Blacc Chyna)
Fuck her so good make her forget Tyga
Break your main bitch, Heart-Heartbreak Gang
She covered up the tattoo of her baby daddy name (lame nigga)
A hundred thousand large on my rockstars
I done come a long way from duckin' cop cars

[Chorus: IamSu!]
You just gotta tell me what you into
We could take a trip and bring your friends too
I'll do this shit forever if I wanted
You just gotta have some money you could spend on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You gotta have some money you could spend on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You just gotta have some money you could spend on

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I put a new McLaren in my driveway (skrrt, skrrt)
There's no cell service up where I stay
Some M's in the bank what they all say
She just want dick, a new purse, and a latte
I got her, now she just wanna hold me again
Attracted to all this gold on my skin
They say, "Boy, you rappin' like the old Eminem"
This took me 5 minutes, I'm just phonin' it in
Listen, once I live this way, I can never switch
In my 20's but I'm livin' like I'm Richie Rich
5 star dinners, you can order any dish
Young Gerald, young Suzie, young Philthy Rich

[Chorus: IamSu!]
You just gotta tell me what you into
We could take a trip and bring your friends too
I'll do this shit forever if I wanted
You just gotta have some money you could spend on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You gotta have some money you could spend on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You just gotta have some money you could spend on

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
Big Suwop got bops on deck
In the penthouse gettin' top to the neck
I'm just tryna make a little money, can you feel me?
She was fuckin' with me now she play for Team Philthy
Now she got the Heartbreak tatted on her
She ain't talkin' 'bout no money so I catted on her
Took her out her element, she hit the panic button
Renegade alert, my homies get it out her purse
All I do is live it then I put it in reverse
I be killin' everything, I needa buy a hearse
This shit is not rehearsed, it's realer than you know
We could fly wherever, baby, where you tryna go? Let's get it

[Chorus: IamSu!]
You just gotta tell me what you into
We could take a trip and bring your friends too
I'll do this shit forever if I wanted
You just gotta have some money you could spend on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You gotta have some money you could spend on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You just gotta have some money you could spend on
