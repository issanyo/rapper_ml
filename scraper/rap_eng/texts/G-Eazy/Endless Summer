[Hook: Erika Flowers]
I had a dream of a place where the sun shined bright
Off in that endless summer
And I wonder if
I asked my momma will my dreams comes true
See I don't know where I'm headed but I know where I'm going
If you want you can follow me too
Run away me and you
Off to that endless summer

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Aye I went hard in the classroom
Simply cause I had my sights set around past June
Graduated chillin' hard in the afternoon
Contemplating verses that I put onto a track soon
Aye I went hard with my last tunes
Dropped The Outsider cause I knew that I'd be back soon
And now the whole world knows my nom de plume
Every time I spit I treat the booth like a bathroom
Grab some nuggets I'm a cannabis holder
I work for this life nobody handed this over
Close to my goals but I'll have to get closer
Deals on the tables now I'm after this closure
Every albums killing they like 'Can he get colder?'
G is who your Girlfriend's panties drip over
Chicks keep asking him "Can he sleep over?"
I'm just doing what I'm supposed to
Don't get mad at me, joker
Aye

I had a dream of a place where the sun shined bright

See I don't know where I'm headed but I know where I'm going
If you want you can follow me too
Run away me and you
Off to that endless summer

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
And all he do is travel town to town
Every night is Saturday, it's always going down
Just copped a million swishers like we're bout to blow a pound
If you been to a show you know that I could move a crowd
I've seen a whole country through the window of my van
They say I'm nice with it I'm just doing what I can
I chopped up the Beach Boys and made it to a jam
Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am
Inspired by the likes of Yeezy, Keith Haring Lil Weezy
Jean-Michel Basquiat to Jeezy
Banksy to the Beatles
Johhny Cash to The Beaters
Put it all up in the pot and that's what's coming through your speakers
I'm trying to be a legend
They tell me it'll come in time
But look around so does everyone so get in line
Man, I just want the whole world to see me shine
So I spend every waking minute on this dream of mine
