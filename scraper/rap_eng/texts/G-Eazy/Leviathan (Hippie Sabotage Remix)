[Chorus: Sam Martin]
Dance with me, you better know your place
Look around, think you've lost your way
I play no games I’ve got many names
Wanna swim in fire, don't take all day
Trouble me and don't be afraid
Still got time to walk away
Lucifer, Leviathan (yeah)
He is I girl, and I am him

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Yeah
Be careful, you don’t want this
Carefree, but there's a dark side that haunts this
Paparazzi gossip, loves to watch this
But drugs take me away when I pop this
Rock 'n Roll, lifestyle at a fast pace
'Rari like a Nascar in a drag race
Zoom, zoom, why the fuck are you in last place?
Need to catch up where I'm at, that's a fast chase
Uh, take a shot 'cause you're drinking slow
Pour a glass, but nothing’s chasing my whiskey though
So, if you didn’t know now, I'm a savage
And this has already been established
Your friends tried to dip, but you here, you’re not trying to go
If you ain't ready for it all, good, let me know
I looked her in her eyes, she stared back all silent
When I told her I'm the devil, I was smiling

[Chorus: Sam Martin]
Dance with me, you better know your place
Look around, think you've lost your way
I play no games I’ve got many names
Wanna swim in fire, don't take all day
Trouble me and don't be afraid
Still got time to walk away
Lucifer, Leviathan (yeah)
He is I girl, and I am him
Lucifer, and I am him

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Drugs on the table on a Wednesday
Long nights and Advil for the next day
You'd be scared if you listen what you're friends say
The worst thing to happen to you, in the best way
Yeah, but no lie, you're attracted to it
A good girl, but you're scared that it's bad to do it
Life is sin, every night we get back into it
But, see, I live in this place, you just passin' through it
Welcome to my world, let me walk you through it
If you step inside the Matrix, ain't no dodgin' bullets
Ain't no fairy-tale, welcome to the darker side
Moon rocks, a glass of water, now she's on a ride
Yeah, she's like "damn, y'all are wildin'"
We live a little different, living on my own island
But clearly it's working 'cause the money keep piling
When I told her I'm the devil, I was smiling

[Chorus: Sam Martin]
Dance with me, you better know your place
Look around, think you've lost your way
I play no games I've got many names
Wanna swim in fire, don't take all day
Trouble me and don't be afraid
Still got time to walk away
Lucifer, Leviathan (yeah)
He is I girl, and I am him
Lucifer, and I am him
Lucifer, Leviathan
He is I girl, and I am him

[Bridge: G-Eazy]
It's a monster, it's not safe here
Run for the hills, but not these hills
Land of after-parties and the cheap thrills
Liquor red cups, endless refills
Weed, cocaine, molly, e-pills
Looks sweet, but the devil's in the details
The flow switch pace when the beat builds, yeah
Lucifer

[Chorus: Sam Martin]
Dance with me, you better know your place
Look around, think you've lost your way
I play no games I've got many names
Wanna swim in fire, don't take all day
Trouble me and don't be afraid
Still got time to walk away
Lucifer, Leviathan (yeah)
He is I girl, and I am him
