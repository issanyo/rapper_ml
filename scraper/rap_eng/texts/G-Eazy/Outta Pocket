[Hook: Chippy Nonstop]
Outta pocket, outta pocket
Outta pocket, outta pocket
Outta pocket, outta pocket
Outta pocket, outta pocket
Outta pocket, outta pocket
You know what you doctored in
Outta pocket
You know what you doctored in
Outta pocket
You know what you doctored in
Outta pocket, out- out- out- outta pocket

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Ummmm my fan base is a mixture
Of slutty blonde girls, pot smokers and blickters
Each and every night I have the wildest adventures
Like fingering your sister
Until my fucking wrist hurts
Here, want to see? I took a picture
Friends call me G
But see, you can call me Mister
My songs play on iPods, phones, and transistors
Chugging on the Brass Monkeys
This is my elixir
A household name, I'm a fixture
You're spending money on these bitches, you're a trickster
That's 'cause you really need to hurry up and fix their
Attitude, "you're acting outta pocket" that should fix her

[Hook: Chippy Nonstop & (G-Eazy)]
Outta pocket, you know what you doctored in
Outta pocket, you know what you doctored in
Outta pocket, you know what you doctored in
Outta pocket
Outta pocket (Actin' dumb, bitch you)
Outta pocket
Outta pocket (Actin' dumb, bitch you)
Outta pocket
Outta pocket (Actin' dumb, bitch you)
Outta pocket, outta pocket (Actin' dumb, bitch you)
Out- out- out- outta pocket

[Verse 2: Chippy Nonstop]
Chippy on the mic, like you in a fuckin' retrograde
MC Chippy, yo this pussy's like a razor blade
Call me when you gettin' paid
Yo, I'm free-minded, you do what your producers say
(Haters be hatin')
Lick-y lick lick lick one time, that slutty tip
Makin', bake this, jump off the nigga's dick
Flow so sexy, it'll make you wanna stir
Flow so sexy, it'll make you wanna stir

[Hook: Chippy Nonstop & (G-Eazy)]
Outta pocket, you know what you doctored in
Outta pocket, you know what you doctored in
Outta pocket, you know what you doctored in
Outta pocket
Outta pocket, you know what you doctored in
Outta pocket, you know what you doctored in
Outta pocket, you know what you doctored in
Outta pocket
Outta pocket (Actin' dumb, bitch you)
Outta pocket
Outta pocket (Actin' dumb, bitch you)

Outta pocket, outta pocket
Out- out- out- outta pocket
