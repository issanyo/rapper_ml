[Intro: G-Eazy & Louis Mattrs]
Yeah
I just wanna do you right
Yeah
I just wanna do you right
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
'Cause you deserve everything and more
You're royalty, a true queen that a king adore
I need you by my side, you the type I bring on tour
Let's fall asleep in L.A., wake up out in Singapore
Doing things I never did before
Fuck being selfish, I just wanna give you more
I'm going out my way so you know what I'm in it for
I pay attention, all the little things to listen for
True love's true compromise
Ride or die by my side as I'm on the rise
But if I fell off tomorrow, would you disappear?
Sorry, it sounds like I don't trust you, I apologize
But I'm a lover and I'm tryna give you all of me
So if you're down to follow me
Gotta do it honestly
You heard about them hoes, my reputation follows me
But I just cut 'em off, trading quantity for quality, you know?
Make it easy

[Pre-Chorus: Louis Mattrs & G-Eazy]
I believe, I believe, I believe (I believe)
I'ma be, I'ma be, I'ma be the one you need (the one you need, you know)
I believe, I believe, I believe (I believe in us, I believe in trust, yeah)
And I will show you that

[Chorus: Louis Mattrs & G-Eazy]
I won't settle for no less (no less)
Give you my hardest, no rest
I just wanna do you right
I hold heaven in both hands
Give you my hardest, no rest (you know)
I just wanna do you right, girl (yeah)
I just wanna do you right (uh)
I just wanna do you right (uh)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Given you my all, nothing less than
More than a wifey, than my best friend
Do it all for my baby, not a question
Your hatin' friends keep hatin', bless them
I wanna be in your room, we could sleep all day
I wanna be somewhere the bullshit can stay away
I wanna get to the point where I don't have to lie
When you ask me "Is everything going to be okay?"
It's easier to sell a dream than keep it real
It's easier to numb the pain than really feel
Make it vanish in a moment with a magic pill
It's easier to lay away than pay the bill
Uh, would you stay with me if I was broke?
When we look in these mirrors, are we seein' smoke?
And this might be the realest shit I wrote
Love's a challenge but this ain't gotta be difficult

[Chorus: Louis Mattrs]
I won't settle for no less
Give you my hardest, no rest
I just wanna do you right
I hold heaven in both hands
Give you my hardest, no rest
I just wanna do you right, girl
I just wanna do you right

[Outro: Louis Mattrs]
And I will bring you all my rights
I just wanna do you right, yeah
I won't leave you down and out behind me
I just wanna do you right, I just wanna do you right
I just wanna do you right, girl
I just wanna do you right
I just wanna do you right, girl
I just wanna do you right
