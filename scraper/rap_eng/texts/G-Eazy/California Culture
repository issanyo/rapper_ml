[Intro: G-Eazy]
On some old-school G shit, haha
California culture, yeah

[Hook: G-Eazy]
I like to drink, I like to smoke
I like to chill and get high
In my California state of mind
(cal-cal-cali state of mind)
I like to drink, I like to smoke
I like to chill and get high
In my California state of mind
(Cal-Cal-Cali state of mind)

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
It was just one of those days
I was laid back chilling, and my homie hit me up around 1
He said, "Yo G, wake up, I gotta couple bad chicks
And they all wanna chill and have fun."
I said, "Got weed?" He said, "Got blunt?"
I said, "Off top, man, you already know
And if you wanna bottle, we can go to the sto'
And if we run out we can go and get mo'."
They all came through
Swisher Sweets all got packed
And we burned five blunts down back-to-back
Stayin' stoned to the bone, I couldn't be higher
Playing Super Nintendo, street fighter
Just chilling, super laid back, posture
With 2001 on, knocking The Watcher
Stay fly, stay high, like a vulture
Bitches and blunts, California culture

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
California boy, I was raised in Oakland
Land of the grapes, everyday we smokin'
Go and hit this, guarenteed you chokin'
And we get hella high, start laughin' and jokin'
Thats how I was raised, first smoked in the eighth grade
All my homies sold weed, they was self-paid
Self-made, young entrepreneurs
Selling dime bags to the herb connoisseurs
This is good fashion to burn my tree
Come back next period reeking of weed
And my teachers would know it was me
So I got a five day suspension, like every other week
Word, shout out to Berkeley High, with the granddaddy
Purp, kept me Berkeley high, hah
Super cool, man, I tried to warn ya
You can tell by my style, I'm from California

I like to drink, I like to smoke
