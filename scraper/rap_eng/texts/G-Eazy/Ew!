[Hook 1: will.i.am & Jimmy Fallon]
Seriously? Look at her butt. Ew!
Oh, she looks like a slut. Ew!
I’m like “what the what”? Ew!
Right? Right? Ew, ew!
Oh, you got to see this, ew!
Oh my gross I can't believe it, ew!
She’s so basically basic, ew!
She’s literally making me sick, ew!

[Chorus: will.i.am & Jimmy Fallon]
This is embarrassing. Ew, ew!
Like seriously, seriously. Ew, ew!
No seriously, seriously! Ew, ew!
I can’t, I can’t! Ew, ew!

[Verse 1: will.i.am & Jimmy Fallon]
Look at look at this. OM-effin-G, what the eff?
You're gonna freakin' flip, like, seriously freakin' flip
Cuz Sally's mad at Iggy because  Iggy's booty's more biggy
And Sally's booty's twiggy so she called her friend Cybie
Now Sally's gonna get impleggies
What's impleggies? Implants, silly, ew!
I'm freakin' for real
I think silicone butts are ew, ew!

[Hook 2: will.i.am & Jimmy Fallon]
Where’d she get that outfit? Ew
That girl is totally ratchet. Ew!
No seriously – who likes that? Ew!
Right right? Ew, ew!
Look at the way she takes pics, ew!
And what's up with those duck lips? Ew!
She's so lame, ew!
Super lame, Ew, ew!

[Chorus: will.i.am & Jimmy Fallon]
This is embarrassing. Ew, ew!
Like seriously seriously. Ew, ew!
No, seriously seriously. Ew, ew!
Oh my gosh. Ew, ew!

[Post-Chorus: will.i.am]
I am not hating
I am merely conversating
With my BFF Sara!
So bust your rhyme, Sara!

[Verse 2: Jimmy Fallon & will.i.am]
It’s Mir.I.Am and you know who
Now here’s some things I think are ew
FaceTime and reclining in
Airplane seats and then Vining
Retweeting tweets, I'm not lying
Cuz even rhyming's annoying!
Bread bowls and ravioli, casserole, a roly poly
Caterpillar on my really old and moldy windowsill, ew
Trapper keepers and a creeper wearin’ sneakers
With the toes and maybe Frozen cuz you knowin’
I don't wanna build a snowman

[Interlude]
Ew! Ew, ew! Ew, ew, ew, ew
Ew! Ew, ew! Seriously yuck!

[Bridge: Jimmy Fallon]
Hello my name is Sara, that's Sara with no "H"
Too bad if you don't like it, cuz haters gonna hate
My Stepdad Gary, he tries to act so cool
Every time we see him, my friends and I say "Ew!"

[Outro: Stepdad Gary, will.i.am & Jimmy Fallon]
Hey funky bunch, what're you guys doing?
Oh my gosh, it's my step dad Gary
And he just ruined it!
I heard that funky beat that you was playing down here
It's a party over here, it's a party over here
Ew!
