[Intro]
Fuck Famous Fiends

[Verse 1]
Hollywood is the greatest hill
I made it, but I'm hated still
The music I create ain't to be famous
I don't need an actress, I'll ask for the waitress
People talk about bullets and forget about the casings
They care about exclamation and throw out the statement
That's why I embrace the hiatus
I would rather delay than send out a beta
Put that in your playlist
Fuck everybody in the a list
'cept Kendrick and J. Cole
But Lil Wayne? He's getting old
Went from rapping in the basement
To the top floor
Can't afford a studio
But yall still ask for more

[Hook]
Am I famous yet?
Where my payment check
The latest shit
Is my hated shit
They want the "old Wulf"
He in Vegas, yeah
I hate sameness, bae
I'm still nameless weight

[Bridge]
As far as I can see
I just need privacy
These girls are giving me treatments
But there ain't no virus in me
I am a victim of piracy
And the parental advisory
I have anxiety
That I will never fit into society
That's just my legacy

[Verse 2]
You will never stop me
I am exposing the truth
Famous results in cocaine abuse
Or getting a larger caboose
Or overdosing on tattoos
There ain't enough taboos
Maybe that's because
They have noone to look up to

[Hook]x2
Am I famous yet?
Where my payment check
The latest shit
Is my hated shit
They want the "old Wulf"
He in Vegas, yeah
I hate sameness, bae
I'm still nameless weight

[Verse 3]
Shout to Razor and all of my haters
Shoutout to the dreamchasers
Shout out to my true savior
Pray for all of the traitors
All these haters do is elevate
Them fuckboys I terminate
Im like ISIS when I detonate
I'm like Rex when I generate
When I'm pissed off, nobody's safe
I need a double like Mary-Kate
I'm on top when I denominate
In this rap chat I moderate
Yall are dead weight that I amputate
Everybody dies and that's just fate
I'm a Lone Wulf with no teammate
The rap game needs an update (stat)
We need that shit ASAP
I'm over you like a baseball cap
Your lost without me like a map
I'd rather go Hollygrove than Hollywood
And that's understood
I don't want the Papparazi in my neighboorhood

[Outro]
I don't want to be famous
I don't want them to shame us
I'd rather be gracious
Than be brainless
Fuck Famous Fiends
