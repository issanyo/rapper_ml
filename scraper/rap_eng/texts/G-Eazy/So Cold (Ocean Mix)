[Intro: G-Eazy]
Yeah
Young Gerald, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Dylon, Dylon with the boom pow
Every week now I switch to a new style
Two 12's in the back just blew out
Everything I do end up in the news now
Leave the club with a few now
Just some Hollywood girls and they do chow
I'm drunk, I'm drunk in the mood now
2 AM, what you wanna do now?
(What you wanna do now?)

Look baby, pass the Stella
Don't spill on me, that's Margiela
Got this Oakland game to tell her
Goddamn, she look familiar
Think we hooked up at Coachella
What's her name? Isabella? Isa- uhhh... forget it

[Chorus]
Yeah, my wrist so cold and my ice on froze
And it's all for you
Yeah, my ice so cold and my wrist on froze
Yeah it's all for you
Yeah, my wrist so cold and my ice on froze
Yeah, I'd die for you
Yeah, my ice so cold and my wrist on froze
Yeah, I'd die for you, oh oh

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Yeah, stuntin', it's satisfyin' but it don't bring you closure
Diamonds my state of mind, I'm drownin' in the ocean
Just stay right where you are and don't come any closer
I'm just gon' handle mine and just maintain composure
People, they say learn from mistakes, yeah
You keep your space, yeah, but all this pain, yeah
You say you go away, yeah, stay in my lane though
You hurt so bad when you went away, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, my wrist so cold and my ice on froze
And it's all for you
Yeah, my ice so cold and my wrist on froze
Yeah it's all for you
Yeah, my wrist so cold and my ice on froze
Yeah, I'd die for you
Yeah, my ice so cold and my wrist on froze
Yeah, I'd die for you, oh oh

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Ay girl, what it do do
If u got friends, cool bring a few through
No fun if the homies can't have none
R.I.P. Nate Dogg shit is too true
And you know what I'm down for
Round 2, Round 3 into Round 4
Mood switched when she knocked at the front door
Next up was the uproar, yeah

Was like a week ago, but we both know how weekends go
Tryna tuck off got some places we could go
Swear she got the deepest throat like wow
She's blessed on blessed
I don't GAFOS
You tryna fuck?
Yes on yes on yes on yes!
