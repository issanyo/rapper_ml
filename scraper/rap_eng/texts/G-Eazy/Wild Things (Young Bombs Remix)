[Verse 1: Alessia Cara]
Find table spaces
Say your social graces
Bow your head, they're pious here
But you and I, we're pioneers
We make our own rules
Our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are selling
There are no buyers here
So gather all the rebels now, we'll rebel rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs
To those who say we can't sit there, we're fine all by ourselves

[Pre-Chorus: Alessia Cara]
So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistaking, we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being

[Chorus: Alessia Cara]
Find me where the wild things are
(Oh my, we'll be alright, don't mind us)
Find me where the wild things are
(Oh my, we'll be just fine, don't mind us, yeah)
Find me where the wild things are
Find me where the wild things are

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
So don't get it mixed up
It's been, my story's never switched up
And I never kissed up
So fuck the world then I got my dick sucked
Try and say I'm too wild
Did my own thing so fuck the cool crowd
Late nights with the music too loud
I made it this far, now ma's just too proud
So if you don't like me
Cause I'm an asshole, well fuck, I might be
I was raised in the land of hyphy
World looked different as far as I see
I'm doing me, don't mind me
Only one time, I'mma tell you kindly
Please fuck off, I don't need you by me
But if you search then you know where to find me

[Verse 3: Alessia Cara]
I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread, I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in crowd
The cool kids aren't cool to me, they're not cooler than we are

[Pre-Chorus: Alessia Cara]
So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistaking, we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being

[Chorus: Alessia Cara]
Find me where the wild things are
(Oh my, we'll be alright, don't mind us)
Find me where the wild things are
(Oh my, we'll be just fine, don't mind us, yeah)
Find me where the wild things are
(Oh my, we'll be alright, don't mind us, yeah)
Find me where the wild things are
(Oh my, we'll be alright, don't mind us)
Find me where the wild things are, things are...
