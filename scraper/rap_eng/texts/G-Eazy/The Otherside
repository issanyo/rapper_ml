[Chorus: Liphemra]
When you're in my house I start to cry
Take me baby, take me  to the other side
Make me shake like you do every time
Only you can keep me satisfied

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Why she so possessive?
Textin' all day so aggressive
I'm watchin' her highs and her lows
She seems like she's manic-depressive
And I only hit it one time
It's not that intense, so why she so obsessive?
The way that she's latched to me, out at the club
Cuffin' just to be suggestive
Sending a message to other girls out
I question your motives, can't tell what your 'bout
Got this bad feeling this thing won't work out
Should tell you fuck off and get my keys and merc out
Just curve you and leave
Desires, at first you deceive
You seem like a angel by virtue of searching to please, but damn
We might suffocate
Would it hurt you to breathe? Fuck

[Chorus: Liphemra]
When you're in my house I start to cry
Take me baby, take me  to the other side
Make me shake like you do every time
Only you can keep me satisfied

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Not with all that clinginess
And I don't need drama, don't bring me this
You're crazy, I know what my limit is
So before it gets weirder, I am endin' this
I heard you've been tellin' your friends
You think we've got somethin', we've got this connection
You thinkin' I might be the next one
Wonder the fuck would you that impression?
Now your just pressin' to get some attention
When I ignore you, then you try to threaten
That you'll tell my girl 'cause you know it's a weapon
You feed on the drama to fuel your obsession
Fuck, I need a whisky, but leave it to you
You'd prolly put poison inside it to kill me
And get off not guilty, your antics are filthy
'Know what you want, it's just not what it will be!

[Chorus: Liphemra]
When you're in my house I start to cry
Take me baby, take me  to the other side
Make me shake like you do every time
Only you can keep me satisfied

[Bridge: Liphemra]
Stay with me forever, don't leave
I'll cry and beg and crawl on my hands and knees
You can lock me in the dark
Throw away the key
For now I'll share, but soon you'll belong to me
Belong to me, soon you'll belong to me
Belong to me, soon you'll belong to me
I'll lock you in the dark and throw away the key
For now I'll share, but soon you'll belong to me

[Outro: G-Eazy]
And why are you acting so possessive?
Callin' all day, that's way too aggressive
I can't belong to you
Bitch you got me fucked up!
I can't take you to the other side
