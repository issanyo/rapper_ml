[Chorus: G-Eazy]
This game is nothin' I'm new to
Money too long for a ruler
I swim in it like Barracuda
Man, I'm goin' deeper than scuba
Y'all know nothin' 'bout this do ya? (yeah)
Y'all know nothin' 'bout this do ya? (uh)
Stay gold and man shout out my jeweler (yeah)
I'm grateful, I'm prayin' to Buddha
This game is nothin' I'm new to
Money too long for a ruler
I swim in it like Barracuda
Man, I'm goin' deeper than scuba
Y'all know nothin' 'bout this do ya?
Y'all know nothin' 'bout this do ya?
Stay gold and man shout out my jeweler (yeah)
I'm grateful I'm praying to Buddha (Buddha)

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
New house, new watch
I play, you watch
Pay checks, new stocks
Put cash, in a shoe box
Old habits, die hard
You suck, you try hard
My block, my yard
Can't nobody here pull my card
I'm stuck to this game like a sticker (sticker)
A beast when I'm off of the liquor (liquor)
She calls when she wants me to dick her (dick her)
So fine that she made me cum quicker (quicker)
Don’t argue, don’t stress, we don’t bicker (bicker)
And this world is changing, I'm quicker (quicker)
And Donald might be the new Hitler (Hitler)
Make me turn off the news with the clicker (clicker)

[Chorus: G-Eazy]
This game is nothin' I'm new to
Money too long for a ruler
I swim in it like Barracuda
Man, I'm goin' deeper than scuba
Y'all know nothin' 'bout this do ya? (Yeah)

I'm grateful, I'm prayin' to Buddha (yeah)

This game is nothin' I'm new to
Money too long for a ruler
I swim in it like Barracuda
Man, I'm goin' deeper than scuba
Y'all know nothin' 'bout this do ya?
Y'all know nothin' 'bout this do ya?
I'm grateful, I'm prayin' to Buddha (yeah)
I'm grateful I'm praying to Buddha (Buddha)

[Verse 2: SmokePurpp]
Niggas hatin', need some milk? (ooh)
On my body, this is silk (yeah)
I'll be rollin' off a pill (yeah)
Out in Texas, bitch I'm trill (trill)
Diamonds swimmin' like Michael (woo)
Money longer than the Eiffel (yeah)
Bitch, stop callin' my cellphone (cellphone)
Fuckin' a bitch with my belt on (woo)
I give a fuck 'bout her friend
I just wanna touch me a M
Ayy, I could've fucked her and her twin
I rather just fuck on her friend
Ayy, I put some golds in my mouth
I put some tatts on my skin (my skin, my skin)
Ayy, I'm stretchin' the money again
I think I want cop me a Benz
