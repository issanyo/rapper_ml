[Hook]
Hell is round the corner where I shelter
(Hell is round the corner, hell is round the corner)
If you believe or deceive, common sense says shouldn't receive
Hell is round the corner where I shelter
(Hell is round the corner, hell is round the corner)
Hell is round the corner where I shelter
(They juice me, seduce me. Dress me up in stussy)

[Verse 1]
Wake up, wake up, wake up
What the fuck happened to me
Feel like I woke up in another world
My whole life, it changed completely
Racing and chasing for this girl
Now I'm neighbors with the devil and he kicks it at my crib
And I stay on the same block as demons, they know where I live
They keep knocking on my door looking for something every night
I think I might give in soon, I feel like I'm losing this fight
Here we go now

[Hook]
Hell is round the corner where I shelter
(Hell is round the corner, hell is round the corner)
If you believe or deceive, common sense says shouldn't receive
Hell is round the corner where I shelter
(Hell is round the corner, hell is round the corner)
Hell is round the corner where I shelter
(They juice me, seduce me. Dress me up in stussy)

[Verse 2]
Yes I'm me and I know everything that I'm about to be
But my vision has been blinded and I can't tell what I see
And I'm lost inside a sea of real deep inadequacy
And I just don't know if I can swim my way on up to breathe
But I need to make it out of this, I'm drowning, and it's obvious
The problem is this pressure's heavy as a hippopotamus
This music's stressing me, I wonder if I'm all in this
Manic depression is what the doctor's calling this

[Hook]
Hell is round the corner where I shelter
(Hell is round the corner, hell is round the corner)
If you believe or deceive, common sense says shouldn't receive
Hell is round the corner where I shelter
(Hell is round the corner, hell is round the corner)
If you believe or deceive, common sense says shouldn't receive
