[Refrain: Dakari]
Don't let me, don't let me go
'Cause I need your special love

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Uh
And when it's real, it never fade away
And stay on hold like it's layaway
Everyday our status isn't healthy, it's just day to day
I wonder, do we make each other better or do we take away?
Yeah, now every time we fight you always cry and get your scream on
You ask me if I need someone to love or just to lean on
The pressure is intense when you tryna be a phenom
I'm carrying my dreams out to infinity and beyond
Just hash it on my chest, told DG "Put a beat on"
This other shit between us, I'm not even tryna speak on
I know you said if I fuck up again then you would be gone
Not tryna be that person I just run over and cheat on
And when this shit gets too real, why every time I run?
And why I always drink too much? And what I'm tryna hide from?
I really need some peace of mind, like, I'm just tryna find some
And I'm just tryna keep you here regardless of the outcome
(You know)

[Refrain: Dakari]
Don't let me, don't let me go (yeah, uh)
'Cause I need your special love (uh)
Don't let me, don't let me go (yeah, uh)
'Cause I need that special love

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Uh
I'm callin' out, so if you hear me, this from me to you
'Cause I been restless all these nights I ain't been sleepin' through
Broken promises that I'd be what you need me to
Easier to say that shit than actually see it through
Describing a person I could probably never be for you
So then I'm contradicting it with all the shit you see me do
But don't believe all of the rumors they be feeding you
You always tell me I'm just tryna have my cake and eat it too
It's probably true, then that's what you're supposed to do with cake
I swear to God I never got that shit
I know you hate to party, know you want me off that shit
Un-followed you on IG but I can't lie, I still watch that shit (yeah)
You got a new guy, you thinkin' you got me shook (got me shook)
Try make me jealous, regretting the loss I took (loss I took)
I hope you find him, I'm hopeful, don't be mistook (yeah)
But Hollywood is a hell of a place to look
You know

[Refrain: Dakari]
Don't let me, don't let me go (yeah, uh)
'Cause I need your special love (uh)
Don't let me, don't let me go (yeah, uh)
'Cause I need that special love
