[Hook: Sho-Down]
You can't let nobody stand in your way
You just gotta get back up, yeah
You just gotta get back up, wohoo
And take down everything that you can not change, now
You just gotta get back up, yeah
You just gotta get back up, wohoo

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Roll up with the windows up
I'm still sippin' whiskey from the solo cup
She down for whatever cause she know what's up
I'm like, "Roll another one", she said "Oh yeah, yup"
Yeah, lookin' out for the rollers
Pass it to the left, I'm looking over my shoulders
Always had a chip, guess it's more so a boulder
I'm always 2 on, you don't never see me sober
Yeah, from the bay to the universe
I'll race you to a million, bet I'll do it first
Rap money stackin lots of yayper
I feel like '06, hot box the scraper, yeah

[Hook: Sho-Down]
You can't let nobody stand in your way
You just gotta get back up, yeah
You just gotta get back up, wohoo
And take down everything that you can not change, now
You just gotta get back up, yeah
You just gotta get back up, wohoo

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
From the BART train to a tour bus
Still the same game except I'm pulling more sluts
More butts, more bucks, never giving more fucks
Did it my way, I'm never taking short cuts
Raised in that town like fool, who put you upon?
E-40, Mac Dre is who I grew up on
I'm just selling game got you if you need a coupon
You can check my resume, see every beat I threw up on
Smoking on grapes, rollin up swishers, no papes
Back of the Ghost, closed drapes
I'm a boss tycoon
Girls in the crowd all swoon
Super high, I'm off to the moon
And I vanished with your girl then I took her to my room
She wants me to slay ooh-kay, that means doom
Boom, and it's to be expected
Knew this would happen as soon as she texted

[Hook: Sho-Down x 3]
You can't let nobody stand in your way
You just gotta get back up, yeah
You just gotta get back up, wohoo
And take down everything that you can not change, now
You just gotta get back up, yeah
You just gotta get back up, wohoo
