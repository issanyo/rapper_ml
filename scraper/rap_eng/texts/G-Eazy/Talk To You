Yeah, let me holla at you what's your name girl?
Let me walk with you, and let me show you some things girl
And I know that your probably thinking that it's game girl
But on the real, see I been looking for a main girl
So can I have a minute, that's only if you wit' it
We can exchange names and then digits then
Arrange visits or just meet up to kick it
But, I'm on your clock my sixty seconds is ticking
Yeah, you a cutie though, see I'm just trying to compliment you
Fly ground, fly too, think I would compliment you
One glance, then I knew for sure I got to get you
Put my name in her phone, and said I'm glad I met you
See said she a Gemini, word we the same sign
And we from the same spot, throw up the same sign
We both work plus school, we on the same grind
Feel like a match, she the one I wanna make mine

[Verse 3: G Eazy]
See, now I ain't bein fast
I just wanna talk with you
No pressure, let me walk around the block with you
Try and think, the kind of future we could walk into
And make you see all of the types of things I could offer you
A lifestyle that includes things that a baller do
And put you in the wifey spot, I do it all for you
And start to do all these types of things I don't often do
You see I hope my future wifey's who I'm talking to
And as some time pass, I prove that I'd be right for you
And I ain't gaming either, no plays or audibles
Do what I oughta do, but momma won't approve
Cause she heard around I be in the streets
Like j-walkers do
Just stop and think ma'
Don't miss an opportunity
(I mean for real though)
Just listen what you do to me
And everything you do ma, you do it beautifully
Call me selfish, cause all I want is you with me
(cause all I want is you with me)
