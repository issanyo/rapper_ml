[Hook: Devon Baldwin]
I stand here waiting for you all the time
Hope you recognize before I fall apart
The one question staying on my mind
Is why you keep playing with my heart
And I've been waiting for a long, long time
Sometimes I wonder what made me start
The one question staying on my mind
Is why you keep playing with my heart

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
I keep saying Imma' change, Imma' change
I'm 22 now it's time to fucking act my age
And I just keep telling her this is just a stage
Where every other night we go party and we rage
And umm.. I be fucking up I know
I'm so immature, I just hope she doesn't know
She's thinking about peacing fast if he doesn't grow up
In the next 5 minutes then she'll up and go
And I'm just saying wait up
Let me show and prove
I know I did some things that you really won't excuse
You really got something I don't want to go and lose
But then she cut me off like when you blow a fuse
And she said to me

[Hook: Devon Baldwin]
I stand here waiting for you all the time
Hope you recognize before I fall apart
The one question staying on my mind
Is why you keep playing with my heart
And I've been waiting for a long, long time
Sometimes I wonder what made me start
The one question staying on my mind
Is why you keep playing with my heart

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
See I fucked around and always cut it close
Sex is like a drug, I always need another dose
I swear I got a problem they can't even diagnose
And I always seem to stumble every time I try to coast
Saying adios to the groupies
Hello again to you
I swear you got something only shown in a few
And much, much better is what I'm goin' to do
And not sweat someone so miniscule
Have you ever loved somebody
That didn't love you back enough?
Brings on a bunch of extra baggage like you packing stuff
I apologize cuz' I know you really had it rough
It's my word, Imma' stop acting up

[Hook: Devon Baldwin]
I stand here waiting for you all the time
Hope you recognize before I fall apart
The one question staying on my mind
Is why you keep playing with my heart
And I've been waiting for a long, long time
Sometimes I wonder what made me start
The one question staying on my mind
Is why you keep playing with my heart
Why you keep playing with my
Why you, why you, why you keep playing with my heart
Why you keep playing
Why you keep playing
Why, why you keep playing with my heart
