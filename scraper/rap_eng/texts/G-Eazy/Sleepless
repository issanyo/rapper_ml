[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Late nights with early mornings
With straight flights back to New Orleans
Trying to stay focused on what's important
The ones that matter, they stay supportin'
So I stay recording, my plane is boarding
Y'all are funny style just like Tracy Morgan
Haters speak but I straight ignore 'em
My lady's Greek and her face is foreign
Like every week I'm going places tourin'
Y'all are hella weak, the songs you make is boring

[Refrain: G-Eazy]
Sleepless, stressin' about success, I light and pass the dro
Every now and then these things do happen though

[Hook: Nylo]
Sleeplessness is killing me
Promises that you would pray for me
Sleeplessness is killing me
Promises that you would pray for me

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
This lifestyle, man it cost a bit
The anxiety I'm exhausted with
One day they'll say "He just lost his shit"
Losin' sleep in the studio trying to make sure it's the hottest shit
But the fans get anxious like
"When the fuck are you dropping shit?"
Man come off of it, rappers dropping the softest shit
While I'm working 'til I'm on top of it
Never take a second and stop and sit and just watch a bit

[Refrain: G-Eazy]
Sleepless, stressin' about success, I light and pass the dro
Every now and then these things do happen though

[Hook: Nylo]
Sleeplessness is killing me
Promises that you would pray for me
Sleeplessness is killing me
Promises that you would pray for me

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Promise me you'll pray for me
Been working every day faithfully
Could really use an eighth of weed
Now I'm going crazy, basically
The album's coming, I promise y'all
You see how long it's taking me? Wait patiently
Since nine I've made my mind, them nine to five's just ain't for me
A dead end job's no place to be, star's what I'm on pace to be
I come from nothing but a bus pass and a dream
No, I must have some esteem
You can trust that's what it mean, yeah

[Hook: Nylo]
Sleeplessness is killing me
Promises that you would pray for me
Sleeplessness is killing me
Promises that you would pray for me
