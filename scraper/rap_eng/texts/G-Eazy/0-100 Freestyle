[Intro]
Yeah, I got it fam, yeah, young Gerald
All the way from the Bay Area to London
Overseas, across the pond
Yeah, let’s go, yeah

[Verse]
Hair slick backwards, I’m dapper
Your bitch is cool, mine is badder
You haters gossip and chatter
All my team we're eating as if we hunt and we gather
Your girl tweeted that I was her favorite rapper, I’m flattered
Yeah, some are still on the fence like “come convince me”
I was with your girl last night, she gave Lewinsky
It’s me against the world right now, don’t go against me
Cause every single thing that I do, I do intensely
I’m a safe bet while these others are sort of risky
When you think of G you think of the girls and all the whisky
Looking from a distance you think that I came up quickly
Yeah, if I ever kiss the game goodbye I’ll leave a hickey
Yeah, just tryna say I’ll leave my mark on it
Biggest journey starts right now, so I’ll embark on it
Man I hop on a track and I shart on it
Yeah, I eat beats I’m a shark on it
Paid dues and I kept my receipt
Hella hours in the studio, rehearse and repeat
So it’ll be a hundred years before I’m reaching a peak
I’m from the Bay bruh I grew up on 40 and Keak
Yeah, yeah and this shit was so unexpected
Son my flows unprecedented, they know I’m up next to get it
Your shit I’ve been unimpressed with
No I’m not the one to mess with
Move aside and make some room
I come through, make you wanna exit
Yeah, cause I’m arriving right on time
Wear a dozen socks to fit my shoes if you tried on mine
And I, have been killing shit lately
Everything is good, I’m never tripping off what they say
I’m with Westwood, overseas
Back from Amsterdam, we was blowing trees
It’s still the same team, yeah, I roll with G’s
I’m just tryna seize all these opportunities
Had your girl over tip-toeing in her socks
(Hahaha, yeah, ay, ay)
And I feel like we picked the locks
I’m not invincible but you can’t put me in a box
Yeah, it’s like I walk through walls
Man these hoes keep calling, I just dropped two calls
Ay, and I ain’t got two flaws, I got my word and I got two balls
Eazy

[Outro]
International
