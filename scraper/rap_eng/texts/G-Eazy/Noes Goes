[Hook: G-Eazy and Swiss Chriss]
Saw a speedy, white teen when I walked in
I walked up, and I tried talkin' till she said she's coming back soon
Now she's in line for the bathroom
Walked out, now she's playing with her nose
All coked out, and everybody knows
The real party started at 3, and all the pretty girls
Wanna party with me!
All the pretty girls wanna party with me!

[Hook: G-Eazy and Swiss Chriss]
Saw a speedy, white teen when I walked in
I walked up, and I tried talkin' till she said she's coming back soon
Now she's in line for the bathroom
Walked out, now she's playing with her nose
All coked out, and everybody knows, everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody, everybody, everybody knows

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
I need a girl, no I need 2
Matta' fact, scratch that, I need a few
I need some girls, who like to smoke tree
And like to start the party, at a quarter past 3
3, 3, 333, all the pretty girls wanna party with me!
And all the pretty girls wanna party with me!
