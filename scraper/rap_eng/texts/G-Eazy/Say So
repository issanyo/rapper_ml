[Intro: G-Eazy & Sample]
What the fuck are you talk...
Walter, he peed on my rug
We're talking about unchecked aggression here dude
What the fuck is he talking about?
My rug... forget it Donnie you're out of your element
Yeah, Young Gerald

[Hook]
If you think you can fill these shoes, well then say so
If you think you can make these moves, well then say so
If that's what you're about now, cool, say it out loud
When you had the chance to, why didn't you say so?
If you're 'bout it, 'bout it, well then say so
I said if you're 'bout it, 'bout it, well then say so
But honestly I can't tell what you're hatin' for
But if you really wanna say it, then what you waitin' for?

[Verse 1]
Clicquot by the caseload, ice buckets where they place those
Blowin' pesos, I don't chase hoes
If she's down she'll say so, in which case we'll switch places
Leave in the whip, it ain't no tellin' where her face goes
The whole Bay knows I'ma be the next to win
Real ones only standin' next to him, doubt it? Guess again
40s like my uncle, HBK is like my next-of-kin
Square Beezy's all up in my ear, stop pesterin'
(Ho shut the fuck up)
Let us in, me and all my brethrens
Smellin' like money in that baby lamb leather skin
You might get it in, yep but just for now cause in the end
Real ones survive while you fuckboys will never win

[Verse 2]
Real ones I fuck with who don't do no fuck shit
Like real talk what's up with y'all stay on some sus shit
This though I must get, you lames got me upset
Bite so much might just turn vampires when dusk hit
Wow, I am not normal, irregular
Let's be sure, they want my spot but it's less deserved
Regular degulars, where do you get the nerve?
I fuck with real ones, the rest get curved out
I think I like her, later I'll have sex with her
Hmm that is if I end up even textin' her
She'll come through then let the rest occur, rest assured
Yes but she won't end up resting here, no
You know, pay attention

[Outro]
You know, go ahead and say it loud so I hear you
Very clear
This pretty ass white boy
He doesn't deserve to be here
How did he get to this place?
This pretty ass white boy in a silk Saint Laurent shirt will fuck your bitch
11 years, night in and night out
You know, these things happen when it's dark out
This shit didn't happen by accident
Shouts out to Vinylz
If you're thinkin' it, if you're sayin' it
Then say it out loud, on a megaphone
In the middle of downtown
FUCK GERALD! FUCK G-EAZY!
HE'S SO CORNY!
OH MY GOD I HATE THE WAY MY GIRLFRIEND LOOKS AT HIM!
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do it to you
It just happened
I didn't mean to trip and fall and land inside of her vagina
I swear it was an accident!
Yeah, if you wanna say it then say so, you know
That's all I'm sayin' man, let's be honest, that's all
From the Bay to the fuckin' universe
Eazy season is approaching
It's that time, yee!
