That boy you know he got some crazy in him
This time I let him know that I ain't playing with them
Supermodels laying with him
Gold teeth just to let you know the bay is in him
I party with the girl you say you cuffing
Got plenty champagne but I don't pay for nothing
If you ain't folding, you better pray I'm bluffing
Yeah they talk a lot but they ain't really saying nothing
And yeah, I've got that Bape in London
A super villain yeah, but I don't wear a cape or nothing
I just snatch chicks, pull hat tricks with smooth tactics
That's practice, haters got problems that they can't fix
Passing loud trees, oh boy, I be like that stinks
Bathroom girls doing lines over glass sinks
Wonder if she'll take it off, oh let's see what cash brings
Celebrating life everytime that that glass clinks
