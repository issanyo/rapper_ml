[Verse 1]
Let's go
Party in a penthouse, until I pass the fuck out
Reminiscing being broke and hoping I would luck out
Now-a-days I pull hoes; Swinging, never struck out
Reinvested everything, just trying to get a buck out
Will I ever make it? Felt fear on my life
For a while was going through a nervous patch
Then I had the most insane year of my life
Crazy, cause I only saw the surface scratched
Yeah, waking up next to a random girl I never knew
Goin' after Marilyn's instead of Sue's
Tryna bring her backstage then see what she let me do
Till security was like, "wait up, who the fuck are you?"
Set backs of being almost on
Opening up the shows I'm trying to get noticed on
Labels calling the telephone that I wrote this on
But I press decline, hit notes, and keep on going on
Take a look at us, it's what you call a team
Freight train, I'm leading everybody, full of steam
Drinking simultaneously, rolling collard greens
Maybe I was higher than a bitch and this was all a dream
Still killing shows with Blizzy
'Member being in his Jeep and riding through the city
Played him Endless Summer said get used to staying busy
Cause you'll never get a fallback, let's go and get a milli
Brought him on tour just to live it
Poppin after parties with some girls who want to give it
All my close homies keep me grounded like a pivot
Talkin' about a way to get it, we already did it!
Switchin' lanes when that Porsche shifts
Homies movin' weight just like a forklift
When my album drops, Jedis can feel the force shift
Meanwhile, you lyin-ass rappers droppin' horse-shit
Only pay attention if you pay me
Chilling with a Sarah and a Vicky and a Jamie
Just a young man living life, could you blame me?
Overcast is snowy but the titty bar is rainy
Dreaming of a million while I sleep on satin
Homies always telling me "just keep on rapping"
I'mma blow the fuck up while you sleep on napping
Fuck you want me to say?
