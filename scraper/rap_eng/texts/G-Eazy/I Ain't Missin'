[Intro: Doe B]
I ain't missin' (don't miss, nigga)
One shot, one chance
The kid, let's do it

[Hook: Doe B]
I fuck who I wanna fuck
Point her out I'mma hit her and I ain't missin'
And you can duck all you wanna duck
Hundred shots out the ripper and I ain't missin'
These niggas tell me they feel me
I drop a hit when I'm ready and I ain't missin'
You know they can't do nothing with me
I ain't ballin', I'm swishin'
I ain't missin'

[Verse 1: Doe B]
Just copped a six for the summer, you know my pull up game vicious
Can hit your bitch if I wanna, real talk, I ain't missin'
Offset with no ceilings
In a room full of prostitutes, boy, you still can't fuck with 'em
Ballin' like I'm Nowitzki
Better yet, like Mark Cuban
I ain't talkin' my necklace when I say my links are Cuban
Bricks comin' in Tuesday
Ah, man, they can't stop me
Got your bitch on that Molly
And got four hoes in the trunk
Nigga, this ain't no Audi
Park the foreign in the projects, they holler "Whoa, Kemosabe"
This a million dollar nigga, bitch I'm Ted DiBiase
Wait for a nigga to trap me, I'm Barry Bonds with the gun
Hit homeruns or better, nigga this the steroids era

[Hook: Doe B]
I fuck who I wanna fuck
When I'm out I'mma hit her and I ain't missin'
And you can duck all you wanna duck
Hundred shots out the ripper and I ain't missin'
These niggas tell me they feel me
I drop a hit when I'm ready and I ain't missin'
You know they can't do nothing with me
I ain't ballin', I'm swishin'
I ain't missin'

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Now pay attention, don't wanna miss this
I came up with the quickness
Haters hate that I made it, they actin' sour as citrus
Walk in rooms and cause reactions
They're like "Who the fuck is this?"
I came with homies but I leave here with bitches
Listen, now if I set my eyes on her
And then decide that I want her
Then I ain't missin', believe me
When I make moves she's a gonner
Whether Rihanna, Madonna, Lana Del Ray, or your momma
She's old as nada, I close my eyes then hit a pinata
I'm as crazy as Patrick, a young American psycho
If I said it, I meant it, now listen there is no typo
Haters keep tryna tell me to shut my arrogant pie hole
But I'm a bull in the booth, who wanna pair against Michael
I kept giving less and less fucks till I got to zero
Now all I care about is pussy, deniero
Tryna take care of my family, I feel like I'm a young Rob De Niro
I'm the villian, I am no fucking hero, it's all for real though

[Hook: Doe B]
I fuck who I wanna fuck
When I'm out I'mma hit her and I ain't missin'
And you can duck all you wanna duck
Hundred shots out the ripper and I ain't missin'
These niggas tell me they feel me
I drop a hit when I'm ready and I ain't missin'
You know they can't do nothing with me
I ain't ballin', I'm swishin'
I ain't missin'

[Verse 3: Maino]
Now, everything in my vision I plan to hit with precision
Niggas food on my dishes, I'm 'bout to handle my business
Lil' homies is trippin', you pray to God that we missin'
I swear to God we ain't missin'
Now up the guard we gonna lift him
Man these pussies is bitches, and my niggas is itching
I just lost my religion so help me Lord, I'm a villain
Got the soul of a soldier, got the vibe of a rider
Got the eyes of a killer, I don't miss when I fire
If that was still in my spirit, I don't talk man I live it
When I speak niggas listen, bullets close like they kissin'
I'm just battle my dough, I'm down bottom with dough
Got them funerals ready, niggas die in the road!

[Hook: Doe B]
I fuck who I wanna fuck
When I'm out I'mma hit her and I ain't missin'
And you can duck all you wanna duck
Hundred shots out the ripper and I ain't missin'
These niggas tell me they feel me
I drop a hit when I'm ready and I ain't missin'
You know they can't do nothing with me
I ain't ballin', I'm swishin'
I ain't missin'
