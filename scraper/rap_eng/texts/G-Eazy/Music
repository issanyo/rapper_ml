[Hook]
Because Hip Hop is all I have
Through the good and through the bad
And all I got is paper on this pad
So hope for a chance
Grinding trying to get my goals accomplished
Because nothing in this world is ever promised
Because Hip Hop is all I have
Through the good and through the bad
And all I got is paper on this pad
So hope for a chance
Grinding trying to get my goals accomplished
Because nothing in this world is ever promised
All I want to do is make music all day
All I want to do is make music all day
All I want to do is make music all day
All I want to do is make music

[Verse 1]
See I was Sixteen, three hundred and sixty three days old
When this story that that I'm about to tell unfolds
A hard headed youngin' thugging just a little bit
Robbing people for the guap hitting licks and stealing shit
Yea we was wild when this son was into gun play
But I knew karma would catch up with us one day
So when I would rob
Man I'm going bankrupt ran up on them hit em
Grabbed his wallet and then we ran off
Ran off a few blocks before I lose steam
Wishing I didn't quit the hoop team
Because then I would be able to run
Without running out of breath
We ran three blocks then we turned and make a left
Said "chill bruh we good" till my heart skipped a beat
And that's when I looked
And seen police rolling down the street
Tried to run but they got us
I knew it was a wrap after that
Sitting in the cop car hands cuffed behind my back
Knew I wasn't coming back for a minute
That meant I wouldn't kick it
But above it all that rap shit was finished
At least for a minute but to take up time
I would sit inside my cell chill and make up rhymes
Banging beats on the wall
And I battled some cats
They like, "damn bruhs white but he go at it with raps"
But couldn't wait to come home
Because for the first time I knew what exactly I wanted to do

[Hook]
Because Hip Hop is all I have
Through the good and through the bad
And all I got is paper on this pad
So hope for a chance
Grinding trying to get my goals accomplished
Because nothing in this world is ever promised
Because Hip Hop is all I have
Through the good and through the bad
And all I got is paper on this pad
So hope for a chance
Grinding trying to get my goals accomplished
Because nothing in this world is ever promised
All I want to do is make music all day
All I want to do is make music all day
All I want to do is make music all day
All I want to do is make music

[Verse 2]
See some people call it luck
And then some people call it patience
This is what I call a product of authentic dedication
I give my heart to music and I give my life to it
So if they hate I'm charging right
Through it, I knew it all along
Till then everything I dreamed about would happen
Build a future have the music but I'm doing it with this rapping
And beats that I'm making crossing fingers that I make it
Cause nobody owes you shit
So you gotta go and take it
See my foots on the pedal
I'll never ever stop cause just because I get signed
Doesn't mean I made it to the top
But I do it for the love so there's nothing you can tell me
I'll never see defeat just like I got a big belly
And I got that from fifth props to him man he already
But since we on the topic of the folks that have helped me
Give props where they due P O J B A B two
Serious but most of all yall the fans I thank you
