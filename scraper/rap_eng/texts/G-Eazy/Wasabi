[Chorus: G-Eazy]
Green green wasabi (ayy)

I'm all night like Denny's (yeah)
Rest in peace Mac Dre (yeah)
Rest in peace Mac Dre (yeah)
Shed a tear on November 1st, will always remember that day (yeah)
Send me pics and I show the team
She bought it all when I sold the dream
Most of y'all don't even know what's clean
I'm in new Gucci and some old Supreme
Been hyphy like 'Way' Perk'
And I'm off the brown when I pour the Heem (yee!, yeah)
Bitch, I'm rich, I pay fifteen hundred just for the jeans (yeah)
Oh my god, I put some M's up in my Chase
All that debt just got erased
Get the fuck out of my face (ayy ayy)
I might go cop a McLaren (ayy)
Just to go run me some errands (ayy)
Bitch, why the fuck is you starin'? (ayy)
Bitch, why the fuck is you starin'?

[Verse 2: Global Dan]
(ayy) All of our money be blue (boom!)
All of our bitches be bad (bad)
Why they be stealin' this swag? (huh?)
I don't know, really, I don't mean to brag
So sad, couldn't choose, so I had to pop both tags
When I walk up in the store, fill up the whole bag
Had a whole lot of money in a throw bag
Lamborghini pull up in the front, we gotta go fast (yeah)
Camera, flashin' lights, action
Paparazzi causing havoc
Can't imagine goin' back to strugglin', redefining fashion
I was broke, now I got some bands (yeah)
Make it rain, do the Shmoney Dance (huh?)
Take a vid and put it on the 'Gram (whoa)
I be around the world, 'cause I'm Global Dan (ayy)
Nut and I'm off, like it's Nesquik (skee!)
Then I move on to my next bitch (yeah)
I dip it right through the exit (err!)
Fuck around and this shit can get hectic
Do the worm, like it's Scotty 2 Hotty (ayy)
I was chilling with a couple of thotties (huh?)
It was me and G, Will in the lobby (yeah)
Nose burning like we sniffin' wasabi

[Chorus: G-Eazy]
Green green wasabi (ayy)
Green green wasabi (yeah)
All this gold on my body (ayy)
Twenty hoes in my lobby (yeah)
Pullin' up in them cities (uhh)
