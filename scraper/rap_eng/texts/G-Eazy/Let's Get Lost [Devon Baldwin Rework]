[Verse 1: Devon Baldwin]
When the colors turn to grey
And nothing feels the same
We weren't ready for the change
But it happened anyway
Over grown, still then cold
Lost control, let it fall

[Pre-hook: Devon Baldwin]
This is something we both know, but before we let it go

[Hook: Devon Baldwin]
Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving
Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
Let's get lost, let's get lost
Let's get lost, let's get lost

[Verse 2: Devon Baldwin]
When you're walking though the fire
But your burns are growing tired
You can't take it any higher
And you don't want to be the liar
Falling slow, caught below
Loss the hold, let it close

[Pre-hook: Devon Baldwin]
This is something we both know, but before we let it go

[Hook: Devon Baldwin]
Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving
Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
Let's get lost, let's get lost
Let's get lost, let's get lost

[Bridge: Devon Baldwin]
Let the flame go
Let it turn cold, let it turn cold
I'Leave you alone, I'll do what I'm told
I'll do what I'm told

[Hook: Devon Baldwin]
Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving
Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
Let's get lost, let's get lost
Let's get lost, let's get lost
