[Intro: Dej Loaf]
Man, you play too much
Yeah, Dame, what up?

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
All my dreams gettin' closer
I ain't gotta look over my shoulder, no (No, no, no, no)
Momma, I'm gettin' older
I'm just ballin' now how I'm suppose to (Whoa!)
All my dreams gettin' closer (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I ain't gotta look over my shoulder no (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Momma, I'm gettin' older
I'm just balling now how I'm suppose to (Whoa!)

[Verse 1: Dej Loaf]
I might just pull up on a bitch with them doors up (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!)
All my niggas gettin' money, throw fours up (And we still throwin' fours)
Thirty-plus a show now, we finna show out (And blow up)
Givenchy style that you know they gonna copy I hang with
Niggas that got it and bitches so bossy I be like
"Hold up, nigga what the fuck you say to me?"
Did it on my own, I'm the one who paved the way for me
Sure enough, pussy niggas gonna hate on me (Ha)
They don't understand how she did it in 365
Don't question my success, nigga, talk to God
Strip club, I be tippin' them dancers (Whoa!)
You ain't chase your dreams so go and fill out them answers on that application
You ain't chase your dreams so go and fill out them answers on that application

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
All my dreams gettin' closer
I ain't gotta look over my shoulder, no (No, no, no, no)
Momma, I'm gettin' older
I'm just ballin' now how I'm suppose to (Whoa!)
All my dreams gettin' closer (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I ain't gotta look over my shoulder no (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Momma, I'm gettin' older
I'm just balling now how I'm suppose to (Whoa!)

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I come through in that Batman, empty man, white tie
Imagine what that look like, Aventador matte white
Shout out to the Bape, all my niggas act right
One tat to the D, dope boys get their sack right (Yeah)
And all my niggas were soldiers
Fuck with me and they'll fuck you over now
Bought my bitches some Rovers, off the issue that I get off the soda (Yeah)
Yeah, I be in the trenches, niggas on the benches
I'm the most searched dog in your mentions
Huh, and you an illa nigga? Pussy, me?
I'll wet a nigga G shit, A+ if they testin' me
All interests fo' silence, they don't resonate
Like I told my nigga Dae, dream on Keen, and I'ma put the whole team on

[Chorus: Dej Loaf & G-Eazy]
All my dreams gettin' closer
I ain't gotta look over my shoulder, no (No, no, no, no)
Momma, I'm gettin' older
I'm just ballin' now how I'm suppose to (Whoa!)
All my dreams gettin' closer (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Young Gerald
I ain't gotta look over my shoulder no (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dame, what up
Momma, I'm gettin' older
You already know, it's good
I'm just balling now how I'm suppose to (Whoa!)

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Now my dreams getting closer
I'm rapping with rappers that I had on a poster
Hung up on my wall superstars of the culture
Listen, I'm just balling now how I'm supposed to
Young Gerald, now I'm on and I get paid
Had the same phone number since the 10th grade
I fixed mom's credit up and all debts paid
Anything she wants I order that, gets it next day
Yeah, 'cause I dreamed about even when they seemed to doubt it
This is nothing new to me, you see me, I've been about it
From listening to Earl on a bus ride
Fast-forward me and 40 sitting court side, yeah
From The Bay to Jupiter, bad then I'm swooping her
Leave In the coupe with her
My bitch is the truth, but I still don't tell the truth to her
You see how I maneuver?

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
All my dreams gettin' closer
I ain't gotta look over my shoulder, no (No, no, no, no)
Momma, I'm gettin' older
I'm just ballin' now how I'm suppose to (Whoa!)
All my dreams gettin' closer (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I ain't gotta look over my shoulder no (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Momma, I'm gettin' older
I'm just balling now how I'm suppose to (Whoa!)
