[Verse 1: CONNOR]

When intuition dies
What’s left to stand on?
Finally, time to face the lies
The biggest thing I’ve ran from
In my mind I see my demise
I’m tryna stick to plan one
And focus on my words and what my fans want
I find serenity when I’m alone in my own space
Always swinging for the fences
Can’t get past home plate
I know my rhymes are fat like Juno’s belly
And I truly don’t give a fuck what people tell me
I’m driven internally
You know I’m hungry
And I’m aiming for the stars
So if I fall, my landing’s comfy
So I 3 Peat like Carter III
I do my best within my music to give you all a part of me
And I ain’t blowing smoke
No Swisher Sweet cigar with me
Try testing my flow
You failing like geometry
To all that’s talking down
Quit bothering me
But I always put in work
That’s my father in me
He taught me hard work, responsibility
So I get it for myself
That’s the baller in me
Even if I told you exactly how I saw me
The good, the bad, the ugly like an Eastwood story
You wouldn’t know the half of it
You wouldn’t know the half
You wouldn’t know the half of it
So get the fuck back

[Verse 2: CONNOR]

This is a song for all my people who’ve been down
Who struggle to lift their smiles when they frown
To all my ladies who be crying because they know they really been around
To all my dogs with their heads up in the clouds
Or maybe in the ground
All my homies be gunning for the crown
This life can be relentless
Pick you up, toss you around
Just get up
And look that motherfucker right in the sclera
And never give up
You can bear it
And in the end
No one really gives a fuck about what you’re wearing
The only thing that matters is how much you’re really caring
I care about my impact on this entertainment
And keeping up my virtues
I could use some help with patience
And everybody has a purpose
You’re not brainless
I’m tryna help you out so you can focus on the pain less
So if you’re faced with stainless
You can shine your light and it’ll rain less
And we can stray away from getting caught up in arraignments
And crash and plummet
Stand up for something
And take it to the max summit
I never bum it
You wouldn’t know, huh?
Cause you don’t know the half of it
