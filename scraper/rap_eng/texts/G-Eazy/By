[Intro]
Hey, Dean
What are you doing?
I knew you are but...today, I feel like we're dancing

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
Dean grounding bitches for her dream
Loosing bitches by yourself
Quantum Boozy, pound that shit down
Niggas turned him with a burn

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
Dean grounding bitches for her dream
Loosing bitches by yourself
Quantum Boozy, pound that shit down
Niggas turned him with a burn

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Good life deserves in rest
