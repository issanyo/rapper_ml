[Intro: Gabriel Garz贸n-Montano]
Keep on keep running
Running and running
Keep on keep running

[Verse 1]
And listen up, I'm from that Bay, (Yee!)
Where slang originates, don't even know what cats say
'06 I remember back in that day
A rubber band around a broken CD player slapping Mac Dre
And back then it was Girbauds wearing bigger clothes
The bay was popping, Keak da Sneak had different flows
And when '07 came, the hyphy movement's window closed
Hearts broke but fuck it, that's the way this business goes
But Uncle 40 Water kept it going
25 years in the game and he's still making choices
Then I moved to New Orleans where they shucking oysters
Everybody speak in southern voices
Home sick, I felt like this was pointless
Culture shock, like what's going on
Had me feeling like I don't belong
My bro said "Look, this music's all that you should focus on"
They'll understand you soon, it won't be long

[Hook: G-Eazy and Gabriel Garz贸n-Montano]
Nobody's perfect, yeah we act a fool
Imma keep on running, nothing's new
Guess I'll keep doing what I naturally do
I'll always keep on running back to you
Yeah, they say, the more things change, the more they stay the same
So Imma always play the game
Yeah, so if I lose today, then I'm not ashamed
Cause times are gonna change

[Verse 2]
Skipping school, blowing blunts in the parking lot
Back in those days, used to spark a lot
Far fetched dreams we would talk about
Making it in rap, tryna start a plot
Tryna crack the code, how a star gets hot
But from where we standing, that's the farthest spot
Ash the blunt and mob cause the cops love to bark a lot
Always finding trouble, it don't matter if it's dark or not
Scrapping after school cause they love to test you
Just to see if you're a narc or not
And I remember what did move me
Is I was in juvie, never giving fucks, acting unruly
Being away from making music, I understood it then truly
And what it did to me
Ankle monitor for 6 months
I couldn't go outside, this shit sucks
Independent study, went to school just once a week
And spent every single other day home making beats
That's how it happened

[Hook: G-Eazy and Gabriel Garz贸n-Montano]
Nobody's perfect, yeah we act a fool
Imma keep on running, nothing's new
Guess I'll keep doing what I naturally do
I'll always keep on running back to you
Yeah, they say, the more things change, the more they stay the same
So Imma always play the game
Yeah, so if I lose today, then I'm not ashamed
Cause times are gonna change

[Verse 3]
Since curfews and cartoons, its been the same team
Just a few youngsters growing up who had the same dream
Moved away when I was 18
But Marty though, he had the car, he had the girls
So he just stayed put in the same scene
And I was jealous, in my eyes he had it
Living solo, had his hustle, spent his free time rapping
He said this shit ain't all that nice and that's what you forgetting
Promised if either of us makes it I'll come back and get them
Finally got a pop so hes coming on the road
And while we're touring everything is gold
When its finished then its back to work to grill food
I know you hate that 9 to 5, I know it kills you
Just know I feel you
I'm trying to fix shit up
I'm trying to make it so we all can chill and live it up
I'm throwing parties and my day ones right here in the cut
Yeah, that's the least bro you've been in my corner since the jump

[Hook: G-Eazy and Gabriel Garz贸n-Montano]
Nobody's perfect, yeah we act a fool
Imma keep on running, nothing's new
Guess I'll keep doing what I naturally do
I'll always keep on running back to you
Yeah, they say, the more things change, the more they stay the same
So Imma always play the game
Yeah, so if I lose today, then I'm not ashamed
Cause times are gonna change
