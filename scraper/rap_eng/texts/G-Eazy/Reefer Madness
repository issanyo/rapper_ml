[Hook: Nas]
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X, catching the jungle fever

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
Or in the whip without some tints
And some bumping speakers
You couldn't catch me on the beat without a ton of ether
That's why I draw a fat crowd like a double feature
So what we twisting up? I got me a variety
Homegrown medicinal strains, come take a ride with me
Can recite Illmatic in its entirety
Cause growing up that album definitely inspired me
Imagining me chilling in New York City in
'94, coppin' nickel bags in the park
Rooting for the Knicks, watching Ewing pass it to Starks
Visualizing when hip-hop was back on the charts, yo

[Hook: Nas]
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X, catching the jungle fever

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Spending every day chilling in July getting high
There's no jobs at all, we just trying to get by
And then the tree kicks and I'm like "Why even try?"
But they're retroing some 3s that I'm dying to buy
I'm trying to increase my revenue off of music
Cause that shit really feel like free money when I use it
Maybe that's why it seems I get it then I lose it
Trying to vacation on an island or a cruise ship
G makes songs that you can roll up and cruise to
If rap was a sport I'd be the guy you always lose to
You drop tapes that everybody hits the snooze through
And wonder why loser is how everybody views you

[Hook: Nas]
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X, catching the jungle fever
