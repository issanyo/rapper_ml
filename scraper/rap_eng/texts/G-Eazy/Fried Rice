Shi ba sui sheng ri zai jin zhao
Zhen zhu de xin li tai qi miao
Shi ba sui sheng ri zai jin zhao
Zhen zhu de xin li tai qi miao

[Verse]
These girls wanna tie a kid down and keep me around
But I would never change; I’m a dog, I’m a hound
But I tell them what they wanna hear
They like how it sounds
Till I’m gone with the wind and I’m lost, never found
I met her at my show, then we smashed right after
If we go three rounds then she'll fall in love faster
The very next morning I’m Casper
In another city for a show somewhere getting plastered
It’s a disaster; to her I’m a drug
I do her kinda dirt, but they still fall in love
And I don’t understand it, foreign chicks on me
And she speak another language like she from another planet
She struggle when I’m gone, It’s hard when I leave
Being Ricky Pen, wear my heart on my sleeve
And she tell me that she love me but it’s hard to believe
Cause I’m coming and going, then I cum then I leave
And I swear I’m really not that shady
But you can’t blame me for who I’ve met lately
Nowadays chicks wanna call a kid baby
As soon as they find out I rap, shit's crazy
But I do play along, yo I can’t front
I give in to every groupie with a fat butt
London to Japan, Hong Kong to Iran
Chicks say I’m the man

[Hook: Onra & G-Eazy]
Shi ba sui sheng ri zai jin zhao
What that bitch say?
Zhen zhu de xin li tai qi miao
Shi ba sui sheng ri zai jin zhao
Uh, what that bitch say?
Zhen zhu de xin li tai qi miao

[Outro: Onra & G-Eazy]
Shi ba sui sheng ri zai jin zhao
And everywhere I go, these girls in my ear
Zhen zhu de xin li tai qi miao
Shi ba sui sheng ri zai jin zhao
And everywhere I go, these girls in my ear
Zhen zhu de xin li tai qi miao
And everywhere I go, these girls in my ear
And everywhere I go, these girls in my ear
