[Chorus: Drew Love]
It's hard to sleep these days
The sounds of all the screams keep me awake
Love is gone, love is gone
Bend until we break, stand by and watch us all go up in flames
Love is gone, love is gone (uh, yeah)

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Shit, the world is in flames
We worry about materials and the simplest things
When cops are killing people, and they can't take the blame
They get acquitted, then you wonder why all the people rage, stupid
We all keep praying for peace, praying for progress
If you live in the hills then you stay in the projects
So folks won't listen if they think what I'm saying is conscious
They'd rather hear me turning up on some simpler topics
Yeah, so what's my place, am I outta line?
Then speaking on what's going on and saying what's on my mind?
This shit is fucked up, plus it's happening all the time
My job, as a rapper is to entertain, we tryna shine
I'm not no politician, but they listen, somebody inform 'em
All the kids gotta find out what's really important
I got a platform and a voice and a stage to perform on
Music could be a good escape, but outside it's been storming, yeah

[Chorus: Drew Love]
It's hard to sleep these days
The sounds of all the screams keep me awake
Love is gone, love is gone
Bend until we break, stand by and watch us all go up in flames
Love is gone, love is gone (yeah, uh)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
As I sit in the studio, guess the thinking is
If the statement's too crazy, then should I finish this?
Or if my image is pretty, don't wanna blemish this
Or ever split up my fans, reduce my relevance
Pay attention and understand what the premise is
Everything not gravy, we can't pretend it is
So I salute YG, fuck the president
'Cause he a fucking racist supported by white supremacists
Fuck Donald, go back to just running businesses
We all wishing somehow we could've prevented this
Until we all love each other, nobody benefits
Minorities and feminists, trans, gays, and immigrants
The government mix politics and religiousness
So a man's body's more free than a woman's is
The anger is real, the riots are limitless
And nothing's gonna change 'til we killing off all this ignorance, yeah

[Chorus: Drew Love]
It's hard to sleep these days
The sounds of all the screams keep me awake
Love is gone, love is gone
Bend until we break, stand by and watch us all go up in flames
Love is gone, love is gone

[Outro: Drew Love]
Monsters, we've turned into monsters
How did we get the way we are?
How did we get the way we are?
How did we get the way we are?
Our conscience, we lost it
How did we get the way we are?
How did we get the way we are?
How did we get the way we are?
We are, we are
How did we get the way we are?
We are, we are
How did we get the way we are?
We are, we are
How did we get the way we are?
We are, we are
How did we get the way we are?
