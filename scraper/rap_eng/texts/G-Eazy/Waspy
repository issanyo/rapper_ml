[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Yeah, she like the way I flip this Tennis shit
But the fact that she don't know the words really says a bit
She says we just friends, don't you love benefits?
Rich girls with beamers and country club memberships
Yeah, where playing golf is a hobby
Where the grass is green and the culture is snobby
When she needs a re-up, she'll call her friend Robby
Rich girl with a trust fund, bitch is waspy
Yeah, and she won't wear it unless it's cashmere
And she won't buy it on sale or if it's last year
She hands daddy's credit card to the cashier
And when she go somewhere she always keep her stash near
She know the deal, we fuck second and we blaze first
She had some work done, just so she don't age worse
She'll fuck me five times, all in a day's work
But won't clean the sheets up, that's the maid's work

[Hook: Tennis]
Coconut Grove is a very small cove
Separated from the sea by a shifting shoal
We didn't realize that we had arrived at high tide, high tide
Will we make it out alive?

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Uh-huh, and the pages of Vogue set her trends
She looks in the mirror, thinks of who she's better than
Slides a bird to the bouncer that she know'll let her in
She's livin' in a fantasy she hopes'll never end, cause she's
19, with a fortune to blow
And she's never had to work, that's a fortunate ho
With a fortunate dro, and a fortune to blow
Munchin' Trix out an antique porcelain bowl
Yeah, we light up and smoke it all, we don't waste any
She make a THIZZ face every time she taste Henny
Sure, her body's lame, but her face pretty
She like to keep her nose runny and her waist skinny
I'm just a punk kid, and she's a rich girl
She's from the other side of town and that's a different world
But what she don't know is how to live a real life
She's a waspy girl, we party all night

[Hook: Tennis]
Coconut Grove is a very small cove
Separated from the sea by a shifting shoal
We didn't realize that we had arrived at high tide, high tide
Will we make it out alive?

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
If real life hit her, she wouldn't know what it was
She only love sex, money, and drugs
If real life hit her, she wouldn't know what it was
She only love sex, money, and drugs
She only love sex, money, and drugs
She only love sex, money, and drugs
She only love sex, money, and drugs

Separated from the sea by a shifting shoal
