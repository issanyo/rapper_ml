I like to scramble my brain like fighter jets signals
I like to go on drug benders
With low income singles

Im Chewing on some pringles
Welcome to my kingdom
Have a glass
Fill up a flask
Relax and just mingle

I’m not chris Kringle
But I’m delivering like it’s Christmas
Naughty or nice I’m scratching your name off my hit list

You’re Fucking scared shitless
You nitwits you cunts
I’m using your tear streaks
To ash out my blunts

Enough
Im the sole ringleader of
Circus de relapse
I pop 3s I cop these then Collapse

I’m totally so wack
Incredibly close that
I float back and flow tracks
I’m so lax
I’m throw backs

Lining the table like I’m the only one able to do it
I bring flame to this game for fuck y’all new music

Abuse it
Like drugs
Just music
No love
Cause the last shred I had was fed to the mutts

No angels
Just sluts
I am the leviathan
I am him
Creatures that come out of nightmares
I am sin
I am
What I am
And what I am is
Stitched up
And violent

Seeing these violet shrooms
Locked away in padded rooms
I’ve been fuckin cray since the womb

I’m not changing the game
Now I’m making a new one
It My rules, my time, my rhymes
So have fun

I’m ready to take a bullet if you really pull through
But too bad
The Clip is Empty now
Thank You
