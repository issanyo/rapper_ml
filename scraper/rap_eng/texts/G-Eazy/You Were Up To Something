[Hook: Caddywhompus]
My God you were up to something
My God you were up to something
My God you were up to something
My God you were up to something
My God you were up to something
But I-I-I'm up to nothing
My God I believe I'm running
And I don't know where we're going to

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Uh, and I remember back when
I was just a little scrawny ass kid that was him
Probably circa '99 6th grade I was in
Found big booty Nikki when I met her I was 10
And maybe she might of been a little hoeish
But I walked around with her acting like I didn't know it
Cause she had boobs, and shiny lip gloss
And I heard she was the one if you want your tip boss
So P.E. when everybody went to swim
We were making out inside the locker room in the gym
She pulled my trunks down then she grabbed a hold of him
It was fucking rad 'til my fucking teacher walked in

[Hook: Caddywhompus]
You, you, you were more than nothing
But I-I-I'm less than something
My heart starts to race its running
And I just can't wait to see what you do, woo

My God you were up to something
But I-I-I'm up to nothing
My God never leave I'm running
And I don't know where we're going to

[Verse 2:G-Eazy]
Uh, and I remember back when I was 13 years still trying to get it in
Told my moms one night I'd spend the night at a friends
Then I went to meet Lexi, Lexi played the violin
I heard she was a square but she might give it up
I just bought some tree thought I might twist it up
She was down for it all said where do you wanna go?
I said back to my crib she said is anyone home?
I said moms, but I think she fell asleep around 10
So we snuck back hoping she didn't hear us walk in
She gave it up fast now I'm thinking epic win
It was fucking rad till my fucking moms walked in

[Hook: Caddywhompus]
You, you, you were more than nothing
But I-I-I'm less than something
My heart starts to race its running
And I just can't wait to see what you do, woo

My God you were up to something
But I-I-I'm up to nothing
My God never leave I'm running
And I don't know where we're going to
