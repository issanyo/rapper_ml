[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Uh, yeah
Cocaine clouds, eyelids peeled
Thirty thousand feet, up's how it feels
Homemade straws, hundred dollar bills
Overflowing cups, 'til the glass fills
Looking down on the earth, marijuana fields
Uh, synthesize capsules and pills
Hollywood castles, the hills
Do it all, wonder will we live past the thrills?
Yeah, pay the prices for a nice trip
Yeah, vices got me in a vice grip
Numbing, can't feel my lip
Wondering “when will I slip?”

[Chorus: Anna of the North]
If you come hit it once, be careful now (be careful now)
'Cause baby once you pick me up, you can't pull me down
Think you can leave me forever now?
'Cause baby once you pick me up, you can't pull me down
'Cause baby once you (baby once you)
'Cause baby once you (baby once you)
'Cause baby once you pick me up, you can't pull me down

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
You know, uh
My personality's addicted to it, ugh
Pick up a habit and I'm stickin' to it
Yeah, I tell my story and they listen to it
Jackson Pollock, paint a picture, see my vision through it
Yeah, when she hit me, I'll be there again
I swear that pussy's like heroin
Used rubbers, dirty sheets, at the Sheraton
Check your pockets for them drugs you been carrying
Uh, hope you got something for the come down
The sun's been up, hey let's roll a blunt now
Too much yay, it's no fun now
We all need limits, gotta learn how

[Chorus: Anna of the North]
If you come hit it once, be careful now (be careful now)
'Cause baby once you pick me up, you can't pull me down
Think you can leave me forever now?
'Cause baby once you pick me up, you can't pull me down
'Cause baby once you (baby once you)
'Cause baby once you (baby once you)
'Cause baby once you pick me up, you can't pull me down

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
I live without consequences
When I play with death, I display talent
Outta' cash buying drugs, can I PayPal it?
Don't talk about it, she'd just stay silent
The Beautiful & Damned, tryna find balance, yeah
She wants molly, she wants all that
I call once and then I call back
If my dealer don't respond back
The whole world's going all black
Yeah, can't handle her, she's out her head
Yeah, and then she looked at me and then she said
"I hope you make it in Heaven for a half hour"
Yeah, before the devil finds out I'm dead

[Chorus: Anna of the North]
If you come hit it once, be careful now (be careful now)
'Cause baby once you pick me up, you can't pull me down
Think you can leave me forever now?
'Cause baby once you pick me up, you can't pull me down
'Cause baby once you (baby once you)
'Cause baby once you (baby once you)
'Cause baby once you pick me up, you can't pull me down
