[Hook: Gusto]
Thats Bae and thats crazy that she came from the Bay
So we getting green then we getting out the way
First we had to get these weak niggas out the way
Now we getting money everywhere, out the way
Out the way, out the way, out the way
Same grind, same goal different day
If you got them packs you better ship them out the way
Out the way, getting paid everyday

[Verse 1: Vell]
Out the way, on my way to the bank
Go hard on the grind everyday
Smoking good cookie, yeah yeah, I got a bakery
And I wish a nigga would try to take from me
(What!)
And my bitch looking Meagan good
Little baby for the hood, fuck me like you should
Do me like you could, we going to have to run it up
All them niggas she was fucking with can't fuck with us
I'm from the Oaktown
She gon' hold it down cause a nigga hold the crown
All this weight baby, tell me can you hold the pounds
You can't run that mouth less I tell you run that mouth

[Hook: Gusto]
Thats Bae and thats crazy that she came from the Bay
So we getting green then we getting out the way
First we had to get these weak niggas out the way
Now we getting money everywhere, out the way
Out the way, out the way, out the way
Same grind, same goal different day
If you got them packs you better ship them out the way
Out the way, getting paid everyday

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Eazy, yeah
If you a hater get the fuck in front of me
Rappers need a favor, I need money nothings free
Unless your name is Vell, I don't even charge a fee
Being real isn't really that hard to be
I made it and I stayed true
See my DNA, yeah that's how the bay do
And I paid dues
People use to tell me stay the same you
Always remember where you're from and stay true
This the least I could do
Make it to the top everybody starts watching you
They gon' try copying you
But you do it worse
Repping every time I do a verse
Bay to the universe

[Hook: Gusto]
Thats Bae and thats crazy that she came from the Bay
So we getting green then we getting out the way
First we had to get these weak niggas out the way
Now we getting money everywhere, out the way
Out the way, out the way, out the way
Same grind, same goal different day
If you got them packs you better ship them out the way
Out the way, getting paid everyday
