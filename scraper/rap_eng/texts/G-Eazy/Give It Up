[Verse 1: Nathan Sykes]
Something happened babe
Only you can make it right
Clear my heavy mind with your tricks
Got that magic baby
Cause everything I fear
Slowly disappears as we kiss

[Pre-Chorus: Nathan Sykes]
Baby I want you close, I want you close, give me your love
Baby I want some more, I want some more, can't get enough
Baby wanna feel your touch, wanna feel your touch, just give it up
And go on and on, on and on

[Chorus: Nathan Sykes]
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't leave me girl
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Please stay with me tonight
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't leave me girl
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I know you're down to give it up

[Verse 2: Nathan Sykes]
Are you happy babe?
I can make it Valentine's
Every single night, dim the lights
I'm ecstatic babe
You got me on a high
Join me in the sky, paradise

[Pre-Chorus: Nathan Sykes]
Baby I want you close, I want you close, give me your love
Baby I want some more, I want some more, can't get enough
Baby wanna feel your touch, wanna feel your touch, just give it up
And go on and on, on and on

[Chorus: Nathan Sykes (G-Eazy)]
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't leave me girl
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Please stay with me tonight
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't leave me girl
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah)
I know you're down to give it up

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Had a show in Sydney in front of Aussies right?
And a show in London on the longest flight
Well it's been too long and you're always right
Just tryna see you after a hard days night
Listen, it's between us, our secret, don't tell
It's Beatles Mania when I leave the hotel
We don't want tabloids, cats have no chill
Tryna be with you alone and we can go 'til
The clock hits morning, it's a sure thing
We snuck out without paparazzi swarming
I'm tryna show you you're the most important
In town one night, ain't tryna be too forward
But we got one chance and I can't wait 'til
The next time I see you, so you should stay 'til
I leave to the next city, disappear
So don't leave, I need you here
I'm saying...

[Chorus: Nathan Sykes (G-Eazy)]
(Yeah) Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't leave me girl (Eazy)
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Please stay with me tonight
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't leave me girl
Woo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I know you're down to give it up

[Outro: Nathan Sykes]
Don't leave, hey
Please stay with me tonight
Don't leave me baby
Oh, you know you got to give it up
Haha
