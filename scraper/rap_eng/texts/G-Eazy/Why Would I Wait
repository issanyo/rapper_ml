[Intro]
Oh, woah-oah
Beach boy in this ho
Nic Nac in this ho
Yeah, yeah
Let me see you

[Pre-Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Everywhere that I go
Swear I see your face
Night time, they tired of me
Swear I hear your name
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Hope it ain't too late
I could have you right now girl
Why the fuck would I wait?

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Why the fuck would I wait?
Why the fuck would I wait?
I could have you right now girl
Why the fuck would I wait?
Everywhere that I go
Swear I see your face
I could have you right now girl
Why the fuck would I wait?

[Verse 1: Yung Pinch]
Why the fuck would I leave?
Say that you want me to stay
Got her rollin' my weed up
Blow the smoke in yo face
Got her eyes on me
Now she coming my way
Shawty bad, tell her back it up
Use that ass as a tray
Too much ass in the way
Might just pass on a day
I'm only here for one night girl
Why the fuck would I wait?

[Bridge: Yung Pinch]
Let me know, let me know, my patience low
I can't take no more, I need you now

[Pre-Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Everywhere that I go
Swear I see your face
Night time, they tired of me
Swear I hear your name
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Hope it ain't too late
I could have you right now girl
Why the fuck would I wait?

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Why the fuck would I wait?
Why the fuck would I wait?
I could have you right now girl
Why the fuck would I wait?
Everywhere that I go
Swear I see your face
I could have you right now girl
Why the fuck would I wait?

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Why the fuck would I wait?
I'm just telling it straight
If we don't fuck the first night (nah)
Second one is too late
Got a lot on my plate
This is not a debate
I'm just tryna be great (yeah)
Upgrade, elevate
On tour livin' great
Every night a new state
Album just went platinum
Tell my agent triple my rate
Trust me, I am on ten
You still livin' on eight
This was all god's plan
I just follow my fate
She just want to tap in
Would have curved me back then
But now she on me, in love with me
That's just how it happens
You know what's in store
You seen this movie before
So why you actin' like you ain't know what you signed up for?

[Pre-Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Everywhere that I go
Swear I see your face
Night time, they tired of me
Swear I hear your name
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Hope it ain't too late
I could have you right now girl
Why the fuck would I wait?

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Why the fuck would I wait?
Why the fuck would I wait?
I could have you right now girl
Why the fuck would I wait?
Everywhere that I go
Swear I see your face
I could have you right now girl
Why the fuck would I wait?

[Outro: Yung Pinch]
They tell me I gotta know
Why would I wait on you? I got to know
Why would I leave if you told me to stay?
After all these nights I thought we'd see this day
They tell me I gotta know
Why would I wait on you? I got to know
Why would I leave if you told me to stay?
After all these nights I thought we'd see this day
