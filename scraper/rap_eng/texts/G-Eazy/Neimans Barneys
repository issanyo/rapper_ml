[Verse 1: Cousin Stizz]
Gucci, Versace
Callin' all the bad hoes from the party
Took 'em to the penthouse from the lobby
Lookin' from this view, I don't see nobody
I got on that Rick, I ain't talkin' Bobby
Ain't no movin' slob, niggas tryna copy
All designer fit like I'm Liberace (ayy)
Live this shit convinced, man no one can stop me
Whoo, hey
Ever since I was a lad
I was out servin' the pack
I been addicted to cash
Runnin' it up like a track
Now 1400 the bag
Gotta make sure that they mad
For all of 'em I was strugglin' bad

[Chorus: Cousin Stizz]
Neimans Barneys (yeah, yeah)

Sauce is drippin' off me, bitch I'm raw like Sushi (drip, drip, drip)
Huh, watch what I'm 'bout to do ('bout to do)
I take your bitch out to Malibu (Malibu)
Nobu, she ordered the halibut
Hella place, only ate half of it
Then we went back to the crib, and went down and shit
You know the rest of the story
Trust me, I stick to the script
If it ain't broken, it ain't fixin' the shit
Rolly, Rolly, on me, Gerald spendin' money (yeah)
