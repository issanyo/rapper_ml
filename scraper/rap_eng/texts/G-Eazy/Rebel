[Hook]
He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel cause he never ever does what he should
He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel cause he never ever does what he should
He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel cause he never ever does what he should
But just because he doesn't do what everybody else does
That's no reason why I can't give him all my love

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Sometimes I feel like a star but only strictly where I'm famous
I'm in this for the longest haul like we'll see where it takes us
I'm throwing back these double shots like whiskey here is weightless
Cause, cause this career I chose was even riskier than Vegas
Yo, you playing no one's in the crowd like it's Pistons-Bucks
Burning sour down for all the days I pissed in cups
And I'll be working 'til I'm rich as fuck
On my own grind, I'm a rebel to the system cause the system sucks
See I'm going places most people ain't seen
And I'm living out a life that most people would see and feign
And everyone's a rapper but everything ain't what it seems
Most people can't run all to well when they're chasing a dream
Yo, think about it, if you ain't catch it that's just what I mean
You try to run fast after something and you run out of steam
You're falling off and falling fast, feel like you're about to scream
While I'm wide awake, may dreams come true, this feeling is supreme, yo

He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel cause he never ever does what he should
He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel cause he never ever does what he should
He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel cause he never ever does what he should
But just because he doesn't do what everybody else does
That's no reason why I can't give him all my love

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Uh, I got a lot of style and I got a lot of taste
Sorry bro, you don't have neither of them not a trace
And I see you try to fit in but it's sad you got to chase
Cause you can't force a puzzle piece if that's just not its place
Chill, slow your roll, find yourself in who you are
Truthfully is gravy, every man alive is not a star
But everybody thinks they are, my oh my, how bizarre
It's whatever, let it run its course I'm about to roll this gar
And you can talk shit all you want but see your ho is wet
And this shit I got on is fucking cool you just don't know it yet
Bet you gone be wearing what I'm wearing, we go hold a bet
But first you got to see your homies do it then you go and get
Fuck off, I don't care what you think of me at all
I'm reckless cause I'm young, that's why we drink until we fall
And I might be a rebel but I revel in it all
So if you're trying to book me for your party schedule in a call, yeah

He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel cause he never ever does what he should
He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel cause he never ever does what he should
He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel cause he never ever does what he should
But just because he doesn't do what everybody else does
That's no reason why I can't give him all my love
