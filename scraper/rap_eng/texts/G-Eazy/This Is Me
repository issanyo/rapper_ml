Last week I had a thought I'm 20 years
Thats old enough to start imagining and plenty fears
Or will I go cause I dont fit in here with any peers
Know theres more to life than smokin weed and drinkin many beers
And partyin but what else to do
When the allure of the fame isn’t helping you
Wish I could tell Jay-Z I see myself in you
I started with a dream and now I'm tryna be wealthy too
But its tough when your balancin it all
And walkin down a tight rope you balance bought to fall
The labels keep tellin me I'm talented and all
But I need another candy girl to really have it all
I'm hungrier than ever for a check
And plus my situation's not at all what you'd expect
I work my ass off, I'm always stickin out my neck
Cause they say the real currency ain't cash but respect
But if you have one without the other
That means that you're a stupid motherfucker
I hate bein' broke, but havin' all the fame
And not havin' to deal and have to be the blame
I wanna win bread and bring it home so after all we can live right
And give half of it to mom just to get right
And just to prove to her, I know she wasn't psycho
For always supportin' this dream, she was right though
But its tough when life's as stormy as the weather
And her health isn't gettin any better
And everydays a struggle, the most recent trouble was her job
She called me cryin, told me she was layed off, God
But she told me, keep my spirits up high
She workin I'll just keep on pushin aimin for the sky
And people wonder why I spend everyday high
Cause my life isn't how its supposed to be, but I try
Keep feelin that I'm livin life wrong
But then I stop trippin as soon as I hit the bong
I go out to the club, pretend my problems all gone
I see chicks at my shows, know the words to my songs
My new girl told me "G" please promise me
If we gon' be together, you gon' have to give me honesty
And honestly I'm tryin baby listen
But it's bitches everyday that see your spot is where they wanna be
I'm tryna do the best that I can for you
I feel that you deserve that and I care for you
Cause while a groupie might love you when your big
Soon as the fame goes, they ain't there for you real
A rappers girlfriend, bad spot for a wife
And this is just to give a snap shot of my life
For all you haters gossipin and speakin all freely
Feelin like you know me cause you listen to my CD
Because I'm in the lime light, you can go and start
A bunch of fuckin rumors, shit is rippin me apart
On one hand I don’t give a shit, the other one I’m sick of it
This is just to tell you what the business is, this is it
This is it, yea I'm sick of it
See my biggest problem is that I give a shit
If I ain't care I swear I'd probably be fine
But instead, this shit is killin my mind

Damn

And that's real

This is me
