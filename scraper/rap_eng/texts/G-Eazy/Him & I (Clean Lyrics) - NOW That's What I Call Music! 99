Intro [Halsey:]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said, "Be true", I swear, "I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love; the crazy kind
I am his and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I

Verse 1 [G-Eazy (Halsey):]
My '65 speeding up the PCH, a hell of a ride
They don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide
2017 Bonnie and Clyde
Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died
Got that kind of style, everybody tryna rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (ha-ha-ha)
Crazy but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber, never would no one touch her
Swear we drive eachother mad, she be so stubborn
But what the f*** is love with no pain, no suffer
Intense, this s***, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars, or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince
(You know)


Chorus [Halsey (G-Eazy):]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie (I love you babe)
He said, "Be true", I swear, "I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love; the crazy kind
I am his and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I

Pre-Chorus [Halsey:]
Ooh-whoa oh
Ooh-whoa oh
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
Ooh-whoa oh
Ooh-whoa oh
In the end, it's him and I
(Him and I)

Verse 2 [G-Eazy (Halsey):]
It's her and I mobbin' till the end of time
Only one who get's me, I'm a crazy f***in' Gemini
Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed all black, suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I
Ever go down or get caught, if they identify
My b**** was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you would never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down b****, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang, if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me, until this thing over
We do drugs together (together)
F*** up clubs together (together)
And we'd both go crazy (crazy)
If we was to sever
You know?
We keep mobbin', it's just me and my b****
F*** the world, we just keep getting rich
(You know?)

Halsey:
Cross my heart, hope to die
To you, I've never lied
For you, I'd take a life
It's him and I
And I swear (ay)
G-Eazy:
Til' the end, I'mma ride with you
Mob and get money, get high with you
Halsey:
Cross my heart, hope to die
This is our ride or die

Stay solid, never lie to you
Swear, most likely I'mma die with you
