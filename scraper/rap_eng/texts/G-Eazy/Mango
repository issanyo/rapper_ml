[Hook]
Little momma let me see you move
Little momma let me see you move
And I might go down
Little momma let me see you move
Little momma let me see you move
And I might go down
Let me taste that mango
Let me taste that mango
Let me taste that mango
And I can do it from a couple different angles

[Verse 1]
She eye-fucked me like she wanna get seduced
Come to the VIP couple shots of the goose
Couple songs later let your girl get loose
Sipping on that Tropicana mango juice
And that was cliche, but I gotta go pop just to reach buzz
I need you to follow what the beat does
Kiss up on your toes I can probably make your feet buzz
Moving up, I want to play with your peach fuzz
Tickle in your thighs with your legs to the sky
Take a break and look up, take a look up in your eyes
Spread your legs real wide and continue
You're shaking I know you want me in you
So tell your boyfriend to stay away
I'm trying to come through and put it down baby
Lately I've been thinking how I wanna have fun
And my tongue wants to play with your vah jay jay

[Hook]
Little momma let me see you move
Little momma let me see you move
And I might go down
Little momma let me see you move
Little momma let me see you move
And I might go down
Let me taste that mango
Let me taste that mango
Let me taste that mango
And I can do it from a couple different angles

[Verse 2]
Told ya, little momma like to move it like a vibrator
That ain't got nothing on the places I'll take ya
I'll make your, face change up
Don't worry about dripping my face stain whats
Little nasty you know I'mma Scorpio
If I get it hot I could take it to the Alamo
I'm a savage, you know I wanna tap it
I'm really trying to see about that mango madness
Absolute really got me perking
I told her my name so I'm way past working
This for certain, I'm way past workin'
I took her to the back and began my service
Got a woman in a rainforest in Brazil
Make her feel like she popped a couple pills
Funny what I can make a girl do
Tongue twister, I turn that thing into a whirlpool

[Hook]
Little momma let me see you move
Little momma let me see you move
And I might go down
Little momma let me see you move
Little momma let me see you move
And I might go down
Let me taste that mango
Let me taste that mango
Let me taste that mango
And I can do it from a couple different angles

[Outro]
Girl tell me who you want more
Girl tell me who you want more
Girl tell me who you want more
Girl tell me who you want more
Little momma let me see you move
Little momma let me see you move
And I might go down
Little momma let me see you move
Little momma let me see you move
And I might go down
Let me taste that mango
Let me taste that mango
Let me taste that mango
And I can do it from a couple different angles
Girl tell me who you want more
Girl tell me who you want more
