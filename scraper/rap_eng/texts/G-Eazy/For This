[Intro: G-Eazy]
Yeah, yeah
Ah

[Chorus: IAMNOBODI & (G-Eazy)]
I waited all my life for this
They told me, that I won't make it
(We used to say, yeah, we used to say)
All my life for this
They told me, I won't make it
But I made it

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
It's tough not to get anxious
Exercising my patience
I thought it never would happen
I swear I waited for ages
Had faith in the journey
I said, "let's see where it takes us"
We want gratification
But see it happens in stages
With a team on my back
A couple times might have cracked
But never broke and I can hold them in fact
Man, you know how much weight was on him?
Must have came from within'
My lanky ass don't even go to the gym
My album in, just one, but twenty mixtapes to my name
A lot of y'all would lose your appetites
With a distaste for the game
Lot of y'all would call it quits
Because you just chase for the fame
Tell my story to inspire you
Just in case you're the same
Self-made, now I employ ten of my friends
Tryna move moms out the Honda
Tryna send her a Benz
Appreciate it all 'cause it's no telling when this shit ends
Unless this is all a dream and then it depends
Well, yeah

[Chorus: IAMNOBODI & (G-Eazy)]
I waited all my life for this
(I've waited, yeah)
They told me, that I won't make it
(We used to say, yeah, we used to say)
All my life for this (yeah)
They told me, I won't make it
But I made it

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Listen, yeah, and all we ever wanted was chances
Dreams of life changing, checks from label advances
Copping mansions
The kind of conversations marijuana enhances
Back then I let them know what my plans is
A poet in sixteen bar stanzas
Sixteen with dreams so far fetched no one understands us
Playing shows in stadiums
Where everybody way up in the stands is
Standing on their feet, I paint the picture on canvas
That I seen, in my dreams in quick visions and glances
Woke up in NYC today, don't think we're in Kansas
Anymore, but sometimes it's hard to be sure
'Cause if I dreamed that it happened, did it actually or?
Am I just still asleep, and none of it's real
Wake up tomorrow right back in the struggle
Tryna come up and build
I don't know this shit gets deep and ignorance is bliss
It's all I've ever loved, I waited my whole life for this, yeah

[Chorus: IAMNOBODI & (G-Eazy)]
I waited all my life for this
(I swear I waited so fucking long)
They told me, that I won't make it
(We used to say, yeah, we used to say)
All my life for this
They told me, I won't make it
(We always knew this shit would happen, yeah)
But I made it

[Interlude: G-Eazy]
Yeah, reporting live from NYC
2015 and forever
Yeah, uh, yeah
I don't know how to end this shit
Yeah, uh, yeah

[Chorus: IAMNOBODI]
I waited all my life for this
They told me, I won't make it
All my life for this
They told me, I won't make it
But I made it
