[Hook]
Got on my leather jacket, thriller
There sure ain't nothin' iller
Man I'm a lady killer, if I want her I'mma steal her
I promise I could make her fly away like caterpillars
So if you don't know by now then you should probably get familiar
So if you don't know by now then you should probably get familiar
So if you don't know by now then you should probably get familiar

[Verse 1]
Just give her; you got no hope, not no sliver
All day I keep drinking whiskey straight until I got no liver
Cold like (brr!), make you shiver
Snatching bitches, leave you bitter
I see what I like then I just go go get her lady killer, get familiar
Yeah, I respond to what I like
Swear this shit goes down like every other night
Man I fuckin' love this life
Put it down and these hoes sayin' they love the pipe
No, I'm not the bring back to your mother type, no
Off that whiskey, 101 proof
I'm just mixing that with Vermouth
She'll be taken if you're aloof
We just fucked on top of that roof
This is real life, these ain't just no raps I kick in the booth
Every thing I say is the truth
Make her disappear just like poof
Then she's gone
Addicted don't know what the fuck I'm on
I can't stop it when I feel it coming on
When we chill it starts with smoking something strong
Take her down and then she'll be the surface that I'm cumming on

[Verse 2]
You're not built like that
Homie, don't get kilt like that
Always browsing 20,000 I'm trying to be Wilt like that
Sick as fuck, I'm ill like that
Roll up then I will light that
I just keep it real like that
I'm taking chicks I'll steal like that
When I get that look in my eye
Can't stop me, don't even try
Text me soon as I will reply
Next up you'll be waving her bye
Then she's gonners; ain't hard to tell
She's smart as hell - that's honors
Don't sleep because it's too easy, I'm out here robbing yawners
Yeah, yo, every night I'm signing boobs with sharpie pens
Crew's rambunctious, raging 'till the party ends
Catch me crashing openings at galleries with artsy friends
Rich girls pull up, park the 'Benz
Flip her, see how far she bends
We start the trends, it's true
This is what I do man, this is nothing new
I feel sorry for the dude who's cuffing you
Girl it's up to you, let me know what to do
Take her down and afterwards she gets around and loves the crew

[Outro]
And I'm a lady killer; I'm a, I'm a lady killer
And I'm a lady killer; I'm a, I'm a lady killer
And I'm a lady killer; I'm a, I'm a lady killer
And I'm a lady killer; I'm a, I'm a lady killer
