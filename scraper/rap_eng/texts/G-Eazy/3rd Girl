Cookin' Soul

[Hook: Larry June]
Aye, how you doing bitch?
I love you sweetie, we can rule the world
I swear to God, you ain't my hoe, baby
Aye, you my bitch, you just my third girl
My third girl, aye, how you doing bitch?
I said, "Yo, how you doing bitch?"
For real though, damn
How you doing bitch?
Let me tell you, you ain't my hoe
You just my third girl

[Verse 1: Larry June]
All a nigga do is talk shit and count hundreds
Board another jet, meet my bitch out in London
One thing I learned being a P, never cuff 'em
Every whip I got a push start and they run it
Bitch looking like some real work, I might run her
Never would of knew she sold pussy on the under
Atlantic city cracking, she just hit for twelve hunnid
She told me when I met her, she didn't need a P for nothing
I looked her in the eyes like, "Bitch quit fronting"
She glancing at my rollie like, "Damn, he get money"
Philly cheese steak, I'm in Philly with snow bunnies
Bodega out in Boston, fuck it, let's cop somethin'

[Hook: Larry June]
Aye, how you doing bitch?
I love you sweetie, we can rule the world
I swear to God, you ain't my hoe, baby
You just my third girl
My third girl, aye, how you doing bitch?
I said, "Yo, how you doing bitch?"
For real though, damn, how you doing bitch?
Let me tell you, you ain't my hoe
You just my third girl

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Listen to me
Fuck a bitch, you on a team of winners, baby
Come and sign up
You on the bench right now
But one day you'll be starting lineup
Some bitches got potential
Sometimes they just need to shine up
If you ain't getting money, bitch
That's your fault, get your grind up
Yeah, I can buy whatever, I ain't tripping what it cost now
I pull up in that skrrr, they say, "Damn it, Gerald got style"
You talking out your neck, bitch
Now you gon' make me hostile
Are you a fucking software update? Cause not now
Bay Area bosses, bitch, yeah, I fuck with Larry
I purchase real estate, you rappers making money, barely
Spend your money wisely, yeah, I recommend it highly
Bitch, you know where I'll be, to that green just like wasabi
And I need some extra in my soy sauce, I like my sushi spicy
I'm from the land of hyphy, bitch, there ain't nobody like me
I'm so international, shouts to $hort and [?]
I'm out in Argentina with a Becky doll Christina

[Hook: Larry June]
How you doing bitch?
I love you sweetie, we can rule the world
I swear to God, you ain't my hoe, baby
You just my third girl
My third girl, aye, how you doing bitch?
I said, "Yo, how you doing bitch?"
For real though, damn, how you doing bitch?
Let me tell you, you ain't my hoe
You just my third girl, yeah
