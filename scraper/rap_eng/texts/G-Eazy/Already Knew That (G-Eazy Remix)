[Intro: Ro James]
Yeah, that's right babe
That's right babe
That's right babe, yeah
That's right babe
That's right babe
That's right babe

[Verse 1: Ro James]
You be acting like you on one
You be acting like you don't want it
How you gon' lie to me?
Don't I stay a hundred if it's some over?
Lil' something like you on top of me right now
Breathing on me and I'm breathing on you
It's like making love, but it's more like making magic
We be stopping traffic
We be going this hard

[Chorus: Ro James]
Oh, but you already knew that
But you already knew that
You, you already knew that, girl
But you already knew that
But you already knew that
Yeah you probably knew that girl

[Verse 2: Ro James]
That's about that
I ain't sayin' no more
'Bout to be about it
I wasn't playin' no more
I ain't playing no more game no more
No no
But you already knew that
You know how to fuck around
You already knew that
Baby go ahead and pull the panties down
Never mind, lemme do that
That's mine lemme do that
Opportunist when I do that
I know you like it when I do that
You my only one babe
You make me feel some type of way
I need your body all day
I'm like a young Marvin in this day
(Oh baby, I can't fight this feeling)
(No no no no no, no no no no)

[Chorus: Ro James]
But you already knew that
Oh, you already knew that
But you already knew that
You, you already knew that girl
You already knew that (You know)
But you already knew that
Yeah you probably knew that girl, yeah

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
You're pretty as fuck but you knew that
Where is your dude at?
You finna get took and you don't have a clue that you left for me
We in New Orleans like 'Who Dat?'
Get in that dress and I'm like how did you do that
Say you deserving the best I'm like true that
Can't argue got me like where is my loot at
Spend some on you that show money I blew that
I'm swiping my black card
They always approve that you're flawless
Yeah, uh
And this is no bullshit, I'm honest
The way that you carry yourself I'm astonished
Could probably Fuck 'round and just marry yourself to be honest
Just saying
See if I make you mine, I'll never let you go
'Cause something about you so special though
And I'm just telling you what you already know

[Chorus: Ro James]
But you already knew that
Oh, you already knew that
But you already knew that
You, you already knew that girl
You already knew that
But you already knew that
Yeah you probably knew that girl, yeah
