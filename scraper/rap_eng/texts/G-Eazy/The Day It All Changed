[Verse 1]
Yeah, Unfuckwithable
Black on black Vader, soundtrack is so cynical
It’s for certain, keep a cup of Bourbon it’s so critical
I’m just getting started, still a couple years from pinnacle
Lowkey I been killing y’all in another interval
You kiss that bitch, you imbecile, her mouth stay on my genitals
Text me ten times I never hit her back, pitiful
I hate how this industry is so fucking political
You should just sit down with all that bullshit go and get a stool
I just don’t believe you, don't know who you think that shit would fool
Yeah, legendary status what I must achieve
She came thru to smash right afterwards I made her up and leave
You don’t even know what I got up my sleeve
Told my team, “We’d make it in a second, trust me, just believe"
Yeah, rap game James Dean, been here
I’m just out here doing shit they ain’t seen
Swear this beat's too fucking hard, telling you bro, Kane's mean
Ever since eighteen, been focused on the same dream

[Hook]
Yeah, that was the day it all changed
Shit just got real, now they’re looking all strange
No longer on a small stage
Never looking back so far beyond y’alls range
That was the day it all changed
Shit just got real, now they’re looking all strange
No longer on a small stage
Came the fuck up since I was making y’alls wage

[Verse 2]
Well, the difference is nowadays I’m making like triple times your dividends
Walk my stage like Johnny Cash, hello to a massive crowd
Quiet but I’m passing loud, solid crew - no rats allowed
Everybody know I’m next to get it, you could ask around
Classic shit, that’s the sound, labels tryna track me down
Faked it ‘til I made it, everything’s official now
Don’t fit in, I stand apart from everybody, that’s just how
Everything I do, I put my name on as original
Skeet on a rich girl’s boobs and watch it trickle down
I want in on every dime bag or nickel now
Every rapper that I’m about to pass up's in a pickle now
Thought you had a home run? Just a foul
Silly stupid rapper, you won’t make it with that simple style
When I’m working I don’t fuck around, shouts to those who stuck around
Always through the up and down I am who they buzz around
Tell me now, how does it sound?
She knows when I come in town, she calls soon as I'm touching down

[Hook]
Yeah, that was the day it all changed
Shit just got real, now they’re looking all strange
No longer on a small stage
Never looking back so far beyond y’alls range
That was the day it all changed
Shit just got real, now they’re looking all strange
No longer on a small stage
Came the fuck up since I was making y’alls wage

[Verse 3]
Remember when I never had shit
Single parent struggles, mom’s always trying to mask it
Age sixteen I set a goal and now I’m past it
Following this dream, shouts to everyone who backs it
From interning, to the flagship
Jealousy is real, see these people talking mad shit
What you making now ain’t even fucking with my last shit
We're eating, get a basket, I’m in this ‘til the casket

[Hook]
Yeah, that was the day it all changed
Shit just got real, now they’re looking all strange
No longer on a small stage
Never looking back so far beyond y’alls range
That was the day it all changed
Shit just got real, now they’re looking all strange
No longer on a small stage
Came the fuck up since I was making y’alls wage
