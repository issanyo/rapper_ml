[Chorus]
If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, better pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money dance turn this shit into a nightclub

[Refain]
Fuck with Qveen and get some money
Fuck with Qveen and get some money
All this swagger came from nothing
No wonder bitches actin' funny

[Verse 1]
They say "Herby-Herbs, you are not very thick"
But I built a brick house by the motherfucking brick
3 million dollar crib, and the mountains looking sick
So I say you can suck my imaginary dick
A year ago the label wasn't picking up the phone
Now they gotta write a check that'll make 'em go broke
When that money get to flowin', they be acting like they know me
See me dropping more bowls than a bowl of macaroni
Only heavy hitters, my bank role getting bigger
Let me paint a picture, small tits and a big vision
Something to consider, I can't stay bitter
Never been a quitter, if you want it I deliver, what's up?

[Refrain]
Fuck with Herby, get some money
Fuck with Herby, get some money
All these bitches came from nothing
That's why they be actin' funny

[Verse 2]
Internet trolls always tryna make peace
Like "Can you sign an autograph for my girl, please?"
I sneak up on yo ass like a bank fee
Watch a couple shows, turn yo ass to a groupie
See I'm Gucci but I'm not Italiano
Already know I got that new collection pronto
Come out the fitting room singing in soprano like
"Thank you, Alessandro"
Then I put a couple down on some Louis
Check my bags when I travel, it's a movie
Used to Nickoldeon, keep it PG
But studies say cussing more gives you more honesty
Honestly, curb the labels, fuck the haters
And I'm still makin' papers, if you sleepin'
Call me when you wake up, I don't want no fake love
I could give a fuck about the fame, I want my cake up

[Chorus]
If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, better pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money dance turn that shit into a nightclub
