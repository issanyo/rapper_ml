[Intro: Muffled + Hook]
Oh I don't know where I'm gonna go
All I really know, is I want you to come with me
And fuck with me, I want you with me
I ain't going home without you, yeah I need you with me
Yeah I need you now, yeah I need you now
Yeah I need you now, yeah I need you now

[Post-Hook]
I just wanna know
Are you down or you not?
Do you wanna go?
Are you down or you not?
I just wanna know
Are you down or you not?
I ain't listening to no one
I'm just drowning them out

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Bout to dip, are you coming with me?
People staring like it's something to see
Come jump in the sea, you come fuck with me
Yeah it ain't gotta be no extra shit, we rush it to be
But I can show you things you probably not accustomed to see
My ex is tripping, what else is new? Yeah that's just a selfish view
Same issues that I'm not tryna help her through
Behaviors always jealous like, fuck you expect me to do?
Texting at two, I only got this one question for you
Let's go somewhere and find something to do
Know I'm impatient, but I just want you
Cause I can't see tonight ending at two
I know I'm faded, but so are you too

[Hook]
Oh I don't know where I'm gonna go
All I really know is I want you to come with me
And fuck with me, I want you with me
I ain't going home without you, yeah I need you with me
Yeah I need you now, yeah I need you now
Yeah I need you now, yeah I need you now

[Post-Hook]
I just wanna know
Are you down or you not?
Do you wanna go?
Are you down or you not?
I just wanna know
Are you down or you not?
I ain't listening to no one
I'm just drowning them out

[Verse 2]
How much time I be spending to chase
I be chilling, I'm not sprinting a race
I mean, of course, she knowing less in the case
She had it all, I mean, a ten in the face
Could tell from clothes to drugs she had the most expensivest taste
Both designer, I hope I find her, let's get higher than higher
I see her, I eye her, like nothing in this world matters prior
Listen, y'all chasing chicks, I'm asking why like I'm Jadakiss
Accept her naked pics make other girls look the basicest, so
I know this isn't your usual form
Just play it safe, try avoiding the storm
I know it's cold but that whiskey is warm
I don't know what to do right now, listen, I'm torn

[Hook]
Oh I don't know where I'm gonna go
All I really know is I want you to come with me
And fuck with me, I want you with me
I ain't going home without you, yeah I need you with me
Yeah I need you now, yeah I need you now
Yeah I need you now, yeah I need you now

[Post-Hook]
I just wanna know
Are you down or you not?
Do you wanna go?
Are you down or you not?
I just wanna know
Are you down or you not?
I ain't listening to no one
I'm just drowning them out
