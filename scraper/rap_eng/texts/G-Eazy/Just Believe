[Verse 1]
Smokin' on the loudest out
Tryna see through a cloud of doubt
Goin' till a pound is out
We all got problems too proud to pout
More than '99, I ain't about to count
Takin' long walks when I'm out and about
Dreaming 10 mil just to round amount
Used to look for direction, till I found a route
Wonder how the charts feel
Paranoia thoughts stay dark, still
Everyday I'm here I try to write songs
Cause I know the beat'll longer than my heart will
Yeah, tryna see every state
No white lighters, hope I see 28
You can tell my girl i'mma be runnin' late
Can't tell how much longer she's gonna wait
A real good girl with a dirt bag guy
She could probably do better than me
Like a rich-ass lawyer with a house and car
Who takes care of her and never leaves
Man, shit I try my best
Nobody here for me to try and impress
I'd rather chase a dream
Than be content to sit behind a desk
I used to live with the highest stress
But fuck it, I digress
Just believe

[Verse 2]
Lately I've been losing sleep
Stressed, sorry if my mood is deep
No one to talk to, I use the beat
A couple bad habits that I choose to keep
My intake of booze is steep
Pop a couple of pills that I use to sleep
I think I took a few this week
I'm trying to adjust to the hugest leap
I'm living off this music, here
But I'm afraid of failing
That's the truth, sincere
My anxiety is getting too severe
But I ain't giving up, there's no excuses here
Dying young might be my truest fear
But now my future's bright and my view is clear
Told her i'mma get it, i'mma do it, dear
There's no way in hell I could lose this year
I worked 10 years 'fore it ever paid off
You don't know what I had to trade off
I shed tears when my moms got laid off
Life's never fair, it never plays soft
I'mma go get it, I'mma do it for my folks
Every day I'm out, man I always do the most
You would do the same shit if you was on the ropes
Shit gets realer when you zooming up close
Just believe
