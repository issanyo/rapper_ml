[Intro: Snow Tha Product (talking)]
I mean, like, this song goes hella hard (laughs)
I don't want G-Eazy to be mad at me or nothing
I just really like this song..

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Pardon my Español, but hola güey
Look I done popped on the scene and I'm suave
Us Cali rappers gas on 'em no low octane
Tours 40 days headlining, no off days
Cortezes, eyeliner, love my chola ways
Still really not concerned what you hoes all say
That is not my job that is yo job, babe
Look I'm from Killa California, bitch you don't want fades
Went from sellin' yadamean to these co-op days
Got my business structured, bitch I get dough all day
I'm just gettin braggadocious, mane don't mind me
But I came a ways from flea markets yellin', "Comprale!"
I'll take it way back, Greyhound, Redwood City
Had the Bay sound when I came out rappin like, "Fuck wit' me"
San Jose shark in daygo cause life was good to me
Now I'm in Hollywood, finna pop fans lovin me
Goin' far

[Hook: G-Eazy and Snow Tha Product]
They used to tell me
I couldn't go too far alone (Far Alone)
They used to always say
I couldn't go too far alone (Far Alone)
But now I'm here, bitch!

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
My parents had a combined income of 20k
Went and quadrupled that shit in one good day
So everything from now on is just icing on the cake
Even on my bad days I just open up the safe
I done went from no job, no income comin'
To several smart investments, check Miss Snow's budget
Nobody gonna tell me shit if you wasn't
With me in '07 slangin' tapes, no buddy
Back when I was sellin' tickets to open in SD
When producers said "To make it best, dress sexy"
Mexi, Lil' chick, backpack, best trees
Yes me hustle, big shouts BMSB
Think I'm not gone make it when they doubt all this shit
When I got on, they was on superficial fake shit
Fake wigs, fake nails, fake ass, fake tits
I done came to bring the real, now they copy pastin'
Wait bitch, keep it simple, never basic
Way that I was getting snubbed, you would think they racist
Tank shit taught me be a shark
Play this rap game for what it's worth
Switch it up and bank quick, so here we go

[Hook: G-Eazy and Snow Tha Product]
They used to tell me
I couldn't go too far alone (Far Alone)
They used to always say
I couldn't go too far alone (Far Alone)
But now I'm here, bitch!
But now I'm here, bitch!
