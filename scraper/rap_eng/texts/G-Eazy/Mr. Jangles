[Skit: Mr. Jangles]
Yea man, what up this Mr. Jangles
These niggas talking about making it rain
I'm tired of these niggas "making it rain, making it rain"
What the fuck is making it rain? The sky make it rain nigga
I make it jangle
These niggas talking about making it rain throwing money everywhere and shit
Nah nigga I go to the club with quarters
I go to the strip club with quarters in my pocket
Nigga I make it jangle
I make it sprinkle
I make it precipitate like that nigga Andre 3k
Andre 3 stacks nigga whatever you wanna call it
I make it jangle just all over the place
I just be up in the club all day
I just walk to the bitches like
"Say bitch"
Jingles quarters
She be like "Oh shit" it's Mr. Jangles
And all the strippers just come out and just start surrounding me and shit
Yea nigga that's what I'm talking about
It's all day like that with Mr. Jangles baby
Every night before I go to the strip club
I take my son, my little Ramocanoe
And we go up to the arcade shop and while that nigga playing blitz or some shit
I go to the machine I put a 20 in that bitch
And about 5000 quarters pop out nigga
And I just be going to town when I go in the strip club
Ballin nigga I just be throwin' that shit in the air
Quarters for every motherfucking body
And when I do that it just be hittin' bitches all in the head and shit
Be hittin them all in the forehead and they kneecaps and they big toe and shit
They just be passing out
I leave the strip club the floor just be silver nigga
Silver
