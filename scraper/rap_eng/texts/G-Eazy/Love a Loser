[Verse 1: Cassie]
I'd rather lose a lover than to love a loser
Everything you did, I wouldn't do it to you
Got my vision clear so now I'm seeing through ya
Writing you a letter, I'mma send it to ya
I'd rather lose a lover than to love a loser
Used to put it on ya like the Kama Sutra
Ain't no looking back, I'm like the new Medusa
Got you on a Sunday screaming Hallelujah

[Chorus: Cassie]
I would rather lose a lover than to love a loser
Rather lose a lover than to love a loser
I would rather lose a lover than to love a loser
Rather lose a lover than to love a loser
Think I'm under your spell
Tell me is it me or the drugs, 'cause baby I can't tell (I can't tell)
Tell me is it me or the drugs, 'cause baby I can't tell (I can't tell)
Tell me is it me or the drugs, 'cause baby I can't tell (I can't tell)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
G, Uh
I'd rather lose a lover than to love a loser, yeah
Damn, that was my baby, thought we had a future, aye
Next to all these options I would always choose her
But she's fragile, feels like every place I touch, I bruise her, aye
Delicate, I fell back, I can't tell if it
Really hope that hurts, she told me she been celibate
Said nobody made her feel the way I did
I felt a bit, a little bit conflicted
I heard she had someone new she was messing with, fuck
I can not tell, I think I'm under her spell
I sent her flowers, and all she sent back was, "Hope all is well"
She said that love don't cost a thing but got that pussy for sale
That woman put me through hell, I fell in love, but oh well
You know? Uh, oh well

[Bridge: Cassie & G-Eazy]
Smoke swirling from the cigarette (What can you do)
Unless you didn't even see my silhouette (Uh)
Unless... you're too numb to even feel it yet (Eazy)
Confess, you second guessed just how real it gets (Yeah)
Oh yeah

[Chorus: Cassie]
I would rather lose a lover than to love a loser
Rather lose a lover than to love a loser
I would rather lose a lover than to love a loser
Rather lose a lover than to love a loser
Think I'm under your spell
Tell me is it me or the drugs, 'cause baby I can't tell (I can't tell)
Tell me is it me or the drugs, 'cause baby I can't tell (I can't tell)
Tell me is it me or the drugs, 'cause baby I can't tell (I can't tell)
