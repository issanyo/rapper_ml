[Chorus: Halsey]
I can feel your heart
Hanging in the air
I'm counting every step
As you climb the stairs
It's buried in your bones
I see it in your closed eyes turning in
This is harder than we know
We hold it in the most
When we weren't there
Coming like a

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Yeah
And I don't know whats going on
I've been holding on to things
That I know are gone
I've been saying that I'm right
When I know I'm wrong
I've been feeling like the world
Gonna know my songs
Every day I really feel I'm losing track and time
And everybody got their own fucking back but mine
Wasn't in-class writing raps
Just to pass the time
Now I wish I could go back in time
When my mum used to pick me up from school
With the light-up shoes
Back when I would follow rules
Funny cause now I refuse
But it made me powerful
I just need someone to look me in the eye
Say "I'm proud of you"
And you don't know my life
You got me all wrong
Every word I ever said now is all gone
With no lifeline who am I to call on?
Other in myself
I'm in hell
I'm lost, mum

[Chorus: Halsey]
I can feel your heart
Hanging in the air
I'm counting every step
As you climb the stairs
It's buried in your bones
I see it in your closed eyes turning in
This is harder than we know
We hold it in the most
When we weren't there
Coming like a

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah
And I don't know what's going on
I've been holding on to things
That I know are gone
I've been in between dreams and a 9 to 5
I'm about to quit this music thing
And go and get a job
I've been looking in the mirror like "who am I?"
Am I everything I claimed to be or did I lie?
And everything is all appealing from a third person
Yeah
But not as pretty when you get inside
All these fake people living of facade
And living a lie
And all they have is two things:
Fast women and pride
I never fitted to the hype though
I'm thinking macro
They just thinking mic grow
And I know what's it like to be alone
To feel like you have flown
So far away from home
I feel so distant
From everyone I've known
I gotta go get it though
I feel it in my bones

[Chorus: Halsey]
I can feel your heart
Hanging in the air
I'm counting every step
As you climb the stairs
It's buried in your bones
I see it in your closed eyes turning in
This is harder than we know
We hold it in the most
When we weren't there
Coming like a

[Post-Chorus: G-Eazy]
Yeah
Lately, I've been broken, yeah
At least I'm being open, yeah
At least I'm being open, yeah
And is gotta come from something
Yeah
That's gotta come from something

[Post-Chorus: Halsey]
I can feel your heart
Hanging in the air
I'm counting every step
As you climb the stairs
It's buried in your bones
I see it in your closed eyes turning in
This is harder than we know
We hold it in the most
When we weren't there
Coming like a a a a
