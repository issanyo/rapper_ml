[Intro: E-40]
Born Leader
Or should I say born to be a leader?
A young street intellect, a loyalist
One that guides and provides
Put his people on and save lives
He who leads and plants seeds for the future to succeed
A global mogul
A triangle, not a oval
Realness he brings
A pharaoh, a king

[Verse 1: Nef The Pharaoh]
Memoirs of a born leader
Mama, you made a king and they do not believe it
Flush the condo when I fuck these hoes, they still ain't see me
I know the Lord, I talk to God, but I don't ever see him
It's 3 am, I've been through five different timezones
Jet lagging, no baggage, I pack light
Tell Gladys she missing a black knight
You are Shaq at the free throw line, straight miss
And all my bitches naked
Wake up in the morning and I'm pissing excellence
Tell her they get nice to [?] chang chang
G said "I want the world", I'm like I want the same thing
It's like I got a blueprint that tell me how to do shit
It was all in the plot, how I made it to the top
Many men off in my city wanna kill to get my spot
It doesn't matter, I'm the rocket, God won't let me stop

[Hook: Nef The Pharaoh & (G-Eazy)]

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Memoirs of a born leader
If she don't see the vision I don't really need her
Kick rocks you beezy, this knocks
I said fuck the bottom, I want the tip tops
I need checks, tryna get them zeros up
I just walked in the room and then she chose up
Thought about a thousand things to do when I blow up
Just a youngster with a dream said "when I grow up"
Umm, I'm tryna be just like 40
They p'rolly  make a movie of my life story
My pain, my come up, my glory
When you make it take care of moms, only mandatory
A real one to the core
I was taught if you ever get your foot in the door
Turn around let your homies in then let in some more
Thats why all of 'em with me every time that I tour
A born leader, G

[Hook: Nef The Pharaoh & (G-Eazy)]
