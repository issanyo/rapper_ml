[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Yeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
And as far as I can see, I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me
Give the world what they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari, I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
Cause this hunger is driving me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speaking on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends
We don't take L's, we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends
I'm right back to work when that break ends

[Hook: Bebe Rexha & G-Eazy]
Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
Cause I, got me for life
(Got me for life, yeah)
Oh I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

[Post-Hook: Bebe Rexha & G-Eazy]
I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah it's keeping me alive
(Keeps me alive)
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (you know)
Cause the music does me good and it gets me every time
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, and I don't like talking to strangers
So get the fuck off me I'm anxious
I'm tryna be cool but I may just go ape shit
Say "fuck y'all" to all of y'all faces
It changes though now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it the rush is amazing
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my anger
I'm swimming in money
Swimming in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here cause I'm sick with it cuddy
They all take the money for granted
But don't want to work for it tell me now, isn't it funny?

[Hook: Bebe Rexha & G-Eazy]
Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
Cause I, got me for life
Oh I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

[Post-Hook: Bebe Rexha & G-Eazy]
I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, that's keeping me alive
I don't need anything to make me satisfied
Cause the music fills me good and it gets me every time

[Bridge: Bebe Rexha & G-Eazy]
Yeah
