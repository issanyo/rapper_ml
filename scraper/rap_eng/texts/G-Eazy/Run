[Intro: Team Robot]
Got my 40 in this bitch with me
I'm next on the weed, too

[Hook: Team Robot]
Uh, we throwin' bitches off the roof
Splash! What the fuck you gon' do?
Fuck Fox News, and fuck you too
Crash a car into the wall and do like Mexicans do: run!
Uh, we throwin' bitches off the roof
Splash! What the fuck you gon' do?
Fuck Fox News, and fuck you too
Crash a car into the wall and do like Mexicans do: run!

[Verse 1: Team Robot]
Oh yeah, believe that's the chorus and that's how we feel
We major market rappers, you hardly localâ€”chill!
Pause, don't meet my session while I'm blessin' this
Only option to be the fuck with us
Know you gotta brawl in this industry, time to knuckle up
We could run for the 40 now you soft taco fucks
Drunk nights in the back of all black chauffeured trucks
Givin' bitches straight wow time no need for lust, they know what's up
What else? Real pimp like mac on it
I'm a G like Slim and I'm pretty like Tony
If you never knew it and I think you need to know me
Tryn' to fuck stevie wonder daughter her name Sophie (Sophia!)
Wonder (That's that bitches name...I knew it!)

[Hook: Team Robot]
Uh, we throwin' bitches off the roof
Splash! What the fuck you gon' do?
Fuck Fox News, and fuck you too
Crash a car into the wall and do like Mexicans do: run!
Uh, we throwin' bitches off the roof
Splash! What the fuck you gon' do?
Fuck Fox News, and fuck you too
Crash a car into the wall and do like Mexicans do: run!

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
H-H-Hollywood parties at the standard
Chilling with some bitches who just graduated Stanford
Now she's on my lap trying to be a private dancer
My girl called my phone and I accidentally answered
Oh well shit happens my lifestyle so fucking random
So if you just don't give a fuck then this your fucking anthem
Mix blunts smoke and that 40 juice provides the perfect anthem
I swear this life's a trip but yo my plane is never landing
I'm going nowhere fast but everywhere between
Say you down with the scene but you nowhere to be seen
So if we don't know you chances are you ain't the truth
Either that or Cypher throw you off the roof (ha ha ha ha)

[Hook: Team Robot]
Uh, we throwin' bitches off the roof
Splash! What the fuck you gon' do?
Fuck Fox News, and fuck you too
Crash a car into the wall and do like Mexicans do: run!
Uh, we throwin' bitches off the roof
Splash! What the fuck you gon' do?
Fuck Fox News, and fuck you too
Crash a car into the wall and do like Mexicans do: run!

[Verse 3: Team Robot]
How you, how you, how you doin', Miss America?
A lesbian? Really? I'm sorry to even pressure ya
Hard ass beats, that's the shit that give my head a rush
They skipping people and punching kids to get ahead of us
Big booty bitches back it up
It's Team Robot, we next to come
Fuck your feelings, we living you coming after us
Old niggas keep talking out the side of they mouth
Until I write a sixteen and make them come diss me
This shit got them so tipsy: halfway drunk, halfway pissy?
Some people born to be stars, I'm just born to make a killing
Throwin' bitches off the building
And all that shit meanless, I don't give a mother fuck
I'm just doing what I'm feelin, nigga!

[Hook: Team Robot]
Uh, we throwin' bitches off the roof
Splash! What the fuck you gon' do?
Fuck Fox News, and fuck you too
Crash a car into the wall and do like Mexicans do: "run"!
Uh, we throwin' bitches off the roof
Splash! What the fuck you gon' do?
Fuck Fox News, and fuck you too
Crash a car into the wall and do like Mexicans do: "run"!

[Outro: Team Robot]
