[Chorus: P-Lo]
Yeah, ayy, ayy
I just want a bad bitch to make me feel good
Yeah
Make me feel good
Ayy, ayy
I just want a bad bitch to make me feel good
Yeah
Make me feel good
Ayy
All I need, is a bad bitch to make me feel good

[Verse 1: P-Lo]
Make me feel good
Make me feel great
Girl, motherfuck your boyfriend
Oooo, he do not matter at this moment
She gon' ride that thang like she stole it
Working like a Mexi, baby call me sexy
Freaky lil thing, throw in my direction
Yeah
Make this feel like a vaca
Relationships take better aim babe
Working like this since the eight grade
Been the same, know I ain't change
If you're playing girl, I ain't got no time
Keep in mind
I'm just tryna see you from behind
Do it right baby girl, is it still good?
I just want a bad bitch to make me feel good

[Chorus: P-Lo]
Yeah
Make me feel good
Ayy, ayy
I just want a bad bitch to make me feel good
Yeah
Make me feel good
Ayy
All I need, is a bad bitch to make me feel good

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
That's all I'm saying haha
Gerald
Uh, hop in that 'Rari and I'm passing ya, vroom
I keep a baddie riding passenger (ayy)
And I'm like damn, she got some ass on her
I'm talking business on the phone with the ambassador
And Unc told me it's all about longevity
So I'm hustling, getting to this money 'til the death of me
Need the dough, been a fiend, Her and I, King and Queen
How she got in them jeans, I'm tryna get in between
And when we pull up to the crib, oh then it's going down
So I push the pedal to the floor, I'm tearing through the town
She reach over with her left hand, she gon' feel wood
I just want a bad bitch to make me feel good
(Ye)

[Chorus: P-Lo & G-Eazy]
You know
Yeah
Aha
Make me feel good
P-Lo, I got you
Ayy
I just want a bad bitch to make me feel good
Yeah
Make me feel good
Ayy
All I need, is a bad bitch to make me feel good
