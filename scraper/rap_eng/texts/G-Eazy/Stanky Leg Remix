G-Eazy

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
I walked into the club and went straight to get a drank
And then I started doing this new dance not what you think
I see this girl she cool, so we doing what we do
Thats when she pinched her nose and said PU your legs stank
Bitch I'm, Bitch I'm, Bitch I'm, Bitch I'm wild
And I don't give a fuck about a thing
So if you witness me up out there trying to dance and trying to sing
Along to whatever song is on then I'm probably gone
Off a blunt and like 3 drinks, oh yea, and two hits of that bong
Whats this song? Stanky Leg, yea I do the Stanky Leg
So go ahead and show your socks, or thats what I think he said
Drop and hit the booty do, shake that whoop-dee-dee-doo
This shit don't make no sense but fuck it whoop-dee-woo and dee-dee-doo
You smell like poo
