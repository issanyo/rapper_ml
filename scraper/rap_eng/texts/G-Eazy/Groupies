[Hook]
Following the stardom wherever we be
Tryna find your way back to VIP
We all know me sorry you're a groupie
And that means you gets no money from me
Tryna chase after the fame, you're a groupie
You don't even know my real name, you're a groupie
Where were you before I came up? you're a groupie
Please come on step your game up, you're a groupie

[Verse 1]
This club is getting crazy I swear I'm about to leave soon
Groupies finna make it to the VIP soon
Some new locks we'll need soon
They damn near pushing breaking down the door to the green room
Security where you at? we need assistance
30 gold diggers and they blocking off the entrance
Tryna catch a glimpse like I swear their sixth sense is
Always know where we finna be and these bitches are crazy
Die hard, full of ambition
A seven nation army couldn't stop their mission
With 007 precision they be on us
And they ain't giving up until the mission is accomplished
Never work alone now, always work with an accomplice
Got they co-workers with them pros never novice
But on the real tip if I'm honest
Man these groupies work so damn hard I'm astonished

[Verse 2]
She'll do anything for me if I tell her do chores
Take your clothes off mommy go and lose yours
Told them straight up we don't like loose whores
But these bops keep sweating me like loose pours
And no lie it's really that deep
Tryna get backstage trying to creep
Kicking till they try to find a plot to get in
Yelling at the bouncer talking 'bout "I know him"
(No you don't)
Some groupies get bold and wanna chase after me
Some groupies get shy and keep staring at me
Some groupies go bad but won't say it to me
"I don't see the big deal he's still Gerald to me"
Either way a groupie is a groupie
Acting like Lucy off of Charlie Brown but I'm more Snoopy
I'mma dog, ain't trickin off a dollar for these rappers
It makes no difference cause nothing's gonna stop her
