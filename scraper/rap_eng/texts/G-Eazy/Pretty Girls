[Intro: Raekwon]
Yo, yo, yo what up?
This my nigga right here man
F.A.B. what up nigga
Mistah F.A.B. what up nigga

[Hook: Carl Thomas (& Raekwon)]
Guys like pretty girls in the world
(Let's get this know what I mean?)
Women love men with money
(Oh shit you got my nigga Carl on this too?)
A girl wants a man with a gangsta plan
(62 bottles, bring em over here man)
Well all my nigga's just with that honey
Pretty girls, pretty girls
(Stop playing man)
Pretty girls, oh
(Forreal man chill man chill)
Well all my nigga's just with that honey
(Nah, not that one right there man)

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Ayo this thing warmed up, unlawful as fuck
Chain swinging fouls, styling with enormous luck
Nigga we richer than Obama
Llama's on us out in the guianas
Bag somethin down niggas I promise
Smoke skinny boy leathers
[?] sweats in the cuereras
Hundred thousand wrapped in the leather
Yo got bull boy money
To whip in them whips
I guess the bricks paid off
Now I'm back in the mix
Dice killas we the ice grillers
But you we stay on chill mode
Break a nigga face he get real bold
The money that we be holding
Hell no 'laxin' in the ill robe
There's no rims that shit is kill-over
Slums, true forties, and guns
Whoadies and ones, Matt Humble
Son's will tumble, stay out the jungle, son one
Your favorite brother, hate on my lover
He's a legend and his money won't pay nothing
Fuck with me

[Hook: Carl Thomas (& Mistah F.A.B.)]
Guys like pretty girls in the world

Well all my nigga's just with that honey
Pretty girls, pretty girls
Pretty girls, oh
(Big bruh Chef man, I love you for that man)
Well all my nigga's just with that honey
(Real talk)

[Verse 2: Mistah F.A.B.]
The first bottle to the Chef, toast to the Don
We definitly eating while you going through a ramadan
The ambiance of sixty bottles of Sean Don
Dope barrel hoodie, bad boy no Sean Jon
From Panama to Maui pretty girls poppin' molly
Roberto Cavallis, drop beemers drove by model hotties
A long way from being street scholars
To Saki Bombs and Benny Hana's
Chilling lounging with pretty mamas
Cables and cabanas, no dress code at club Katana
And jewish lawyers got us laughing in court at your honor
I skipped school cause gear my had me embarrassed
Now it's Rodeo Drive in L.A., champs [?] in Paris
And everybody in my circle great
Yeah I'm a long way from section eight selling purple grape
To rocking with Rae, the creator of the purple tape
The pretty girls are everywhere, what a work of fate

[Hook: Carl Thomas (& G-Eazy)]
Guys like pretty girls in the world

Well all my nigga's just with that honey
Pretty girls, pretty girls
Guys like pretty girls in the world
Pretty girls, oh
Guys like pretty girls in the world
(Yeah, haha)
Well all my nigga's just with that honey

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
And last night I fucked you wouldn't guess who
Called the lobby told them I was bringing a guest through
Facts I'm not tryna impress you, but since I got some status
I get picky now with who I say yes to
She clings cause I'm young and successful
Notices we're stuffed, and your belly is less full
And she becomes attached, cut her off, shit is stressful
Feeling I don't come to no rescue I don't give her no refuge
We just fuck in a king bed
And I don't drive her home I call the Uber out instead
I learn from my OGs that's what the son of a pimp said
Hustle till you get the crown on top of a king's head
Yeah, blowing bands life is grand I just had to say
It's a blessing trading verses with F.A.B. and Rae
On the rocks drinking Buillet not Aleezay
All day forever after bread homie that's the bay
Yeah, Eazy

[Hook: Carl Thomas]
Guys like pretty girls in the world

Pretty girls, pretty girls
Pretty girls, oh
Well all my nigga's just with that honey
Guys like pretty girls in the world
