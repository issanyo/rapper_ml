Everything costs something bro
Winning somewhere, somewhere else you just lost something though
The cost of opportunities is always good to know
But if you know that then you're good to go
Yea, no dreams too big
Chase anything you have the passion to do
Only a dream 'till it happens to you
Finally seeing money now I'm acting a fool
Never thought touring the world all year would be something I might actually do
Friends came through got me so high
I forgot who I was passin' it to
Party in a mansion splash in a pool
Reminiscing '06 back in the school
When my whole crew would come through and rap with us too
Couple of them been goons, packin in a tool
Go ahead try and talk shit on me
I squad up come back with a crew
Call me a bitch see what that's gonna do
Fights in the streets like that shit was cool

Yea, We used to do dumb shit daily
Dreamed since I was just a baby
Now I'm here its "Fuck you, pay me"
I just had enough of waiting
I worked hard, they stuck with lazy
If I stayed I'd have just went crazy
People change
Everything's in constant motion
My old girl's across the ocean
Some stuff fades thats lost devotion
Some folks stay some come and go
Ain't what you think it's what you know
I must run fast you're running slow
Smoke, break down some kush and roll a dutch
Right now my vibe's so alive so please
When we smoke just hush
Me and some of those who's closest to me haven't spoken much
Crazy when you learn the cost of blowing up
Yea

I know I should keep in better touch
But that door it never shuts
Even when we chilled I never said that much
Sometimes it be worth the bullshit sometimes you should let it flush
Yea, but when I'm on tour now I just get a rush
Everything is hella plush
Get caught up in all the girls I get and stuff
Meanwhile I see some girls I used to know are getting wed and stuff
Having kids with full salary jobs while I'm just getting drunk
Missing every birthday anniversary
Yesterday my moms got out of surgery
Wasn't even in town
Shows and after parties what I've been 'round
Finding out the news late
Imagine how that shit sound
Sit down priorities are all over the place and shit
Stress levels rise and that J gets lit
Try on shoes that Jay Z fit
Fuck all that complacent shit
I'm just dropping crazy shit
Trying to outdo those fool who think they can spit
But I can't even lie
All this real life shit is passing me by
Talking to myself and I'm asking me why
Would I feel better as an average guy?
But I know that's just a lie
Pour up a glass and get high
Wonder if this rockstar life taking a toll on me like I'm asking to die
Going on tour for 6 months, hug moms right after she sigh
Look up wish me luck when you see that plane pass in the sky
No Stress bullshit gets passed to the side
Working hard to make sure I'mma be the man when I die
Yea

Hey Gerald I just wanted to leave a message
Just to talk about with you
You have risen to the peaks of A. behavior
And creativity, and its just the beginning Gerald and it's going to be your life by the sounds of it, and I'm just so proud
