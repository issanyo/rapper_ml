[Refrain]
Low-lives this
Hoes stops for the strobe lights
Grow up, baby
Slow down, let the rope down (she's filling the blanks)
We can go 'till there's no life, no life can escape it
Bring it on to the cold life, so high, can we play?
I gotta know who broke my dream
But you'll find it's a night (like my night)

[Bridge]
And all it's got me saying oh baby
Turn it round baby
Oh baby [?]
Oh baby

[Verse: G-Eazy]
Uh, it's like I'm here, but I'm not
I'm on one, my mind appears to be shot
Tryna navigate this high while I just steer for the top
As I prepare for the drop
I roll another one to share with this thot
At this height we up all night we watch the sun rise as casual
Cause as you go from right to afterwards feels irrational
When coming down it's hard to tell what's real and what's actual
As the night passes gradual, staying at high, feels so natural
Took half a pill at 12:48
2:35 I grabbed a baggie of shake
And dumped out half on this plate
Inside my head I always have to debate
Is this a dream or am I way up here just halfway awake?
I'm sad

[Refrain]
Low-lives this
Hoes stops for the strobe lights
Grow up, baby
Slow down, let the rope down (she's filling the blanks)
We can go 'till there's no life, no life can escape it
Bring it on to the cold life, so high, can we play?
I gotta know who broke my dream
