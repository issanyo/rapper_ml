[Intro]
M-M-M-Murda

[Chorus]
She said, "I don't smoke, I don't sip, I do blow and that's it" (that's all)
Gotdamn, that bitch lit, Gotdamn, that bitch lit
Gotdamn, that bitch lit, Gotdamn, that bitch lit
Gotdamn, that bitch lit, Gotdamn, that bitch lit
Gotdamn, that bitch lit
Yee!

[Verse 1]
Do a couple drugs, have a ting slide
She gon' bust it open, let me inside
If I was normal, woulda' been died
Fight night next to Puff, sitting ringside
Yeah, and this is not for the faint of heart (it's not!)
Yeah, Murda Beatz I'm just painting art (Murda)
If you ain't grinding, you should maybe start
Listen, If you ain't grinding, you should maybe start
Yeah, I be on my job everyday (yeah)
Reppin' everywhere I go, bruh I am the Bay
Off the molly, now she rolling like a bicycle
Well, she just likes what she likes to do (ayy!)

[Chorus]
She said, "I don't smoke, I don't sip, I do blow and that's it" (that's all)
Gotdamn, that bitch lit, Gotdamn, that bitch lit
Gotdamn, that bitch lit, Gotdamn, that bitch lit
Gotdamn, that bitch lit, Gotdamn, that bitch lit
Gotdamn, that bitch lit
Yee!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Gotdamn, that bitch lit
The sun is coming up and she ain't tryna quit, uh
She just wanna rage a little bit
On a level, 7 A.M., she still up and tryna sniff
'Cause every night's occasion's always special
She go the hardest, she don't ever hit her threshold
Party, party, might've broke a new level
Just bought a new Rollie with the polar bear bezel
Short skirt with the fishnets
Yeah, all my diamonds clear as Windex
Yeah, Schwarzenegger with the big flex
Gotdammit, I could never pass a piss test

[Chorus]
She said, "I don't smoke, I don't sip, I do blow and that's it" (that's all)
Gotdamn, that bitch lit, Gotdamn, that bitch lit
Gotdamn, that bitch lit, Gotdamn, that bitch lit
Gotdamn, that bitch lit, Gotdamn, that bitch lit
Gotdamn, that bitch lit
Yee!
