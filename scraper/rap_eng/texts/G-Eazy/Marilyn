[ Intro ]

I do love you
Babe it's not right, what can I do?

[ Verse 1 ]

I wish we was
I wish we were
The way we had been before
Holding and running
Kissing and hugging
On your counter to the kitchen floor
Yeah I'm always gone but still need you
I mean what else do you want me to say
I'm chasing a dream
So it's hard to be with you every step of the way

But
If love is a gamble, I'll show you my cards
If love is a marathon, I'll take you to Mars
If love only hurt you, I'll show you my scars
Cause happiness ain't easy
Cause nobodies ever perfect
Nobodies ever perfect
If you love without the pain, then how would you know it's worth it?
She said

[ Chorus ]

I do love you
(She looked at me and she said)
Babe it's not right, what can I do?
(What can we do, what can we do?)
I do love you
(She looked at me and she said)
Babe it's not right, what can I do?
(What can we do, what can we do?)

[ Verse 2 ]

You keep asking me how I'm doing, and if everything's all right
I mean, you ask me how I'm doin' almost every single night
Can you tell me how it is that you let me fall
Tears pourin' down your face up against the wall
Heart breaks, old texts
Missed phone calls
Old fights, new fights
Lets forget it all
You say you want to love me
But you never really tried
Every kiss you ever gave me, I guess that it was just a lie
Yeah, nothing seems the same, but
My feelings never change, so
I guess I'm goin' insane
Cause I'm still walking in the rain

Our love was a poison, but we ate the apple anyway
Winning and losing, we both ended up hurt either way
Feeling like this has got to go, but can we save this dying ship?
Arguments falling like dominoes and we're down to our final chip

But
If love is a gamble, I'll show you my cards
If love is a marathon, I'll take you to Mars
If love only hurt you, I'll show you my scars
Cause happiness ain't easy
Cause nobodies ever perfect
And if anybody, you deserve it
If you love without the pain, then how would you know it's worth it?
