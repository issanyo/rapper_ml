[Intro: Dion]
Here's my story, it's sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love, then ran around
With every single guy in town

[Hook: Greg Banks]
She played with my heart, made me question, if I was insane
Sue's the prettiest girl in town but she's venom to your veins
Heartbreak hotel room, 505
I was blinded by love, and the way she lied
Not me, no way, but that day she fooled me
When I caught Sue running around
She was running around, she was running around, she was running around
She was, she was running around

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Um, so I said "Peace!," and I left it
Can't get mad at me when your actions request it
Couldn't even tell me to my face, had to text it
You can pack your bags, follow signs to the exit
Yes, move it along please, pronto
Oh, and by the way, return your keys to the condo
If you played at the Apollo
You'd be the type of act that I would boo off stage
While I throw you a tomato
A tough act to follow, but you fooled me, bravo
Can't believe I fell for your bull, Chicago
Can't believe you asked me to stay, nah, hoe
I'm outta here with rocket power, babe, Otto

[Hook: Greg Banks]
She played with my heart, made me question, if I was insane
Sue's the prettiest girl in town but she's venom to your veins
Heartbreak hotel room, 505
I was blinded by love, and the way she lied
Not me, no way, but that day she fooled me
When I caught Sue running around
She was running around, she was running around, she was running around
She was, she was running around

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Well, I should've known she would run around
Chill for a second, then peace when the Summer's down
Now, how dumb I sound, ever since I fell for the apple of my eye?
Cupid always keeps his gun around
When I smash, she was like a woman from the past
A Mary Tyler Moore with more ass
Should've figured something when she let me score fast
But I was misguided, thinking she had more class
Nah, I couldn't be wronger
Fuck it anyways, it was time to move onward
I'm tripping no longer
Put her on the streets like a Banksy
'Cause I was too swanky, and she was too skanky

[Hook: Greg Banks]
She played with my heart, made me question, if I was insane
Sue's the prettiest girl in town but she's venom to your veins
Heartbreak hotel room, 505
I was blinded by love, and the way she lied
Not me, no way, but that day she fooled me
When I caught Sue running around
She was running around, she was running around, she was running around
She was, she was running around

[Outro: Greg Banks]
She was running around (hey), she was running around (hey), she was running around
She was, she was running around
