[Verse 1: E-40]
I'm having my paper, I'm having my mail
It's Feezy G-Eazy and my nigga Ezale
We live in California where the hustlers dwell
Where they play with the K's and digital scales
Some pop pills, and some drink bo
Some snort coke, and some smoke dro
I put The Bay on my shoulders a long time ago
Way before Tell Me When To Go
Old heads, young dreads
Housing authority, task force and feds
Prepaid calls, rollers and kites
Harley Davidson, scraper bikes
Checkers and chess, cards and dice
In the Bay Area all walks of life
Samoans, Italians, Hatians and Asians
Nigerian, Indian, Latin, Blacks and Caucasians

[Hook: Ezale & (E-40)]
Straight to the point when it's 'bout the dough
Straight to the point when it's 'bout your hoe
Straight to the point so it's time to go
(Sideways on my way to the liquor store)
Straight to the point when it's 'bout the dough
Straight to the point when it's 'bout your hoe
Straight to the point so it's time to go
(Sideways on my way to the liquor store)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Young Gerald quarterback on 40
The way that some of these other rappers be acting is corny
Taking your girl home and I'm smashing her surely
Hit twice, dip out and head back to the party
5 drinks that I might be on, I'm with global icons who put hyphy on
At the party on one off a bottle of Earl
Young Gerald gets a lot of the pearl
Yeah, it's not an accident, and I'm super sic wit it
I dream, i do it, I did it, went to the coupe from the Civic
Got your girl on my line, she sick, I'm doing a minute
I do the most and get going as soon as i hit it
Yeah, aye, this is history here
Take 'em all back '06 is the year
Back when The Bay told 'em all when to go
'bout to change the game again, and that's all you should know

[Hook: Ezale & (E-40)]
Straight to the point when it's 'bout the dough
Straight to the point when it's 'bout your hoe
Straight to the point so it's time to go
(Sideways on my way to the liquor store)
Straight to the point when it's 'bout the dough
Straight to the point when it's 'bout your hoe
Straight to the point so it's time to go
(Sideways on my way to the liquor store)

[Verse 3: Ezale]
Me, G and E four-o
Hook was just saying I'm the next to blow
Getting money fast and professional
With the town on my back cause I rep the O
No it's never been an issue, smoking up in here
We in a non-smoking venue, no stop I continue
I keep getting calls, from your broad
And now she in a video, showing it off
Nah, not me, not E A Z
I beat the bitch down with the words I speak
She offered me head, and she offered me money
But I'm all about bread if you know Drug Funnie
Balling like (?) won't stop at a milli
Cause I hated when my pockets was empty
I borrowed the dough, doubled up the sale
We use a long (?) for the fishscale

[Hook: Ezale & (E-40)]
Straight to the point when it's 'bout the dough
Straight to the point when it's 'bout your hoe
Straight to the point so it's time to go
(Sideways on my way to the liquor store)
Straight to the point when it's 'bout the dough
Straight to the point when it's 'bout your hoe
Straight to the point so it's time to go
(Sideways on my way to the liquor store)
