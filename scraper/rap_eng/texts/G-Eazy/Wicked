[Intro: Mike Posner & Blackbear]
Keep your distance from her
Keep your distance from her
Keep your distance from her
Keep your distance from her

[Verse 1: Blackbear]
Would you give me a moment? Give me a try
Don't leave me hanging, no, that isn't right
Why do we do this? Throw me a lie
You like the attention, and you get what you like

[Pre-Chorus: Blackbear]
I just wanna get you closer
I don't wanna play these games
All you wanna be is wanted
Makes your ego okay
Why you gotta tease me, baby?
Why you gotta play these games?
Every time you come over
I don't ever get no play

[Chorus: Blackbear & Mike Posner]
She's fucking wicked
But I love the way she hurts me
I'm so addicted to her loving
That girl is vicious
When you see her, be sure
That you're keeping your distance
From her loving

[Verse 2: Blackbear]
I'm being the good guy, I'm being polite
You tell me I'm too nice, maybe you're right
And I don't wanna hear that, I ain't your type
What does that even mean, girl? Can I get a reply?

[Pre-Chorus: Blackbear]
I just wanna get you closer
I don't wanna play these games
All you wanna be is wanted
Makes your ego okay
Why you gotta tease me, baby?
Why you gotta be this way?
Every time you come over
I don't ever get no play

[Chorus: Blackbear & Mike Posner]
She's fucking wicked
But I love the way she hurts me
I'm so addicted to her loving
That girl is vicious
When you see her, be sure
That you're keeping your distance
From her loving

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Yeah, could list a million reasons why it wouldn't work
She asked, "When the last time you had to put in work?"
She stopped my hand when I would try to put it up her skirt
She don't wanna give it, she just wanna flirt
Pretty as a picture, but she do me dirt
When she don't hit me back, I start to go berserk
Goddamn, babe, why you leave me hangin'?
Why you playin'? Think she do it all for entertainment
Yeah, she should walk around with a warning sign
"Do not touch, keep away, avoid the fine"
Super bad bitch, she ain't sorta fine
Stayed over and she vanished by the mornin' time
Payed a pretty penny just to take her out
And she ain't let me smash, we only makin' out
My homie told me, "Stay away, she trouble, bro"
But I think I'm addicted to her lovin' though
You know, uh

[Chorus: Blackbear & Mike Posner]
She's fucking wicked
But I love the way she hurts me
I'm so addicted to her loving
That girl is vicious
When you see her, be sure
That you're keeping your distance
From her loving

[Outro: Mike Posner & Blackbear]
Keep your distance from her
Keep your distance from her
Keep your distance from her
Keep your distance from her
