Superhero syndrome
Cause I ain't trynna be no ordinary Flintstone
Superhero syndrome
I swear my chances are brighter than my skin tone
We might not ever make it but at least you gotta try
And I'm not trynna be no Superman just trynna be that guy
And I might never save your life and I might never learn to fly
But if you need me go ahead and put my symbol in the sky

[Verse 1]
Ask my girl, I can never be no ordinary lover
So every time I fuck her she feels like she married Usher
She love when I'm above her can't compare me to another
I say I love her only thing I never do is cuff her
I'm giving her the best sex her body's ever had
How I make her scream and yell bet we make the neighbors mad
Her girlfriends be jealous when she tell 'em how it is
Swear I got that type of loving make her wanna have my kids
But truthfully at times shit is hard staying real
Cause I'm always writing rhymes and this shit ain't paying bills
So it's like I'm trynna take her out to restaurants to eat
But I know I should be hitting up the lab to wreck a beat
Cause I just wanna reach the highest level that I strive
Cause I'm always working hard to stay alive
Cause I don't always feel like the star feel like a zero in disguise
But that's me, I wanna be a superhero in her eyes

[Verse 2]
I want people to come up to me in public
And tell me how they ride to all my music and they love it
And I just want a home I mean in every single city
Hella randoms telling me they fucking with me
But honestly I know
It's dream that every rapper sharing with me
But if you think about it then the odds are all against me
But I wanna be that winner and shine with all my homies
And all the kids I grew up with can say they all know me
And shit has been crazy as of lately to be real
Cause you pay to get into the clubs that pay me just to chill
And I love the atmosphere it's all my homies and some models
While these VIP waitresses supply us all with bottles
But the very next morning I wake up and realize
That I got a long way to go to be one of those guys
At the top of the game but I still work hard to rise
I just wanna be legit a superhero in your eyes
