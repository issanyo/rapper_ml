[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Party, party, goin' Christmas H.A.M
Got a stack of paper like a business plan
Take your girl in the back wait 'till you sniff this hand
Swag, swag, I got bitches man!
Private section's how it tends to be
Every night hot babe sitting next to me
Yeah, I must got permanent drunk vision either that or all these girls look 10's to me
Which is more or less prolly the case
Met a girl named Molly with the jolliest face
Swag-olly, swag like Muhammed Ali with grace
All these bitches shakin' ass they just follow the bass
I could say what I wish to
If you listen closely or you skip through
G is the name you should prolly get hip to
Kickin' bitches out the condo jiu-jistu

[Verse 2]
Swag, swag, swag
10 bad bitches at the club got back
*sniff* Oh, that was yours? Oh, what a drag
See she just got green room shagged
Wait a min
She came in with a man right there yes, yes thats him
Got poured all filled to the brim
But a bitch don't drink if she ain't chip in
More or less, yes
Pretty rich girls with plastic b-b-b-breasts
I could give a fuck less
Life is cool, I'm young and blessed
I-i go ham
Shouts out there Jay Fay that's fam
Moombah, this right here my jam
Errybody errybody let me see hands


Swag
