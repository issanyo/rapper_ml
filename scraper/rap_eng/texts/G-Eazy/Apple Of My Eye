[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
The other day seen this girl walk by the other way
I would have spoke but when I looked at her she looked the other way
Had it been another day I would have grabbed her by the hand
You don’t know who I am but see I love the way you smile
Do you got a man I’d be honored if I can walk with you for a second
That's if you ain’t got no plans
I’m trying to get to know you cause you’re the type I go to
The type I write a song and make a beat about and flow to
Anything to show you how beautiful you are
Wish I could hold you at night and every morning say hello to you
But you don’t know it yet
Maybe I’ll approach you next time and let you know exactly how I feel about you
Until then I think of how fly it would be if it were her and I
The apple of my urban eye
And next time no lie I guess I’ll try cause I

[Hook: Erika Flowers & (G-Eazy)]
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
(No lie she the apple of my eye)
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
(No lie she the apple of my eye)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
It was one week later when I peeped her at the bus stop
Laid eyes on her and it damn near made my heart stop
Caramel skin tight jeans and some high tops
Knowing I should go and talk to her fuck it why not
I walked over but I still couldn’t do it
It was something on my mind had me tripping going trough it
See fly girls always hurt you when they kiss you
And I’m never out of dodge when cupid aims with his pistol
They leave wounds and they scab and they pus
Just when I was thinking that I look up and seen the bus
Come back to reality awoke out of my fantasy
That’s when I could swear she whispered come sit in the back with me
I put my eighty-five cents in and walked to the back where the only open seat was next to her
And I was extra sure until somebody sat first
Damn I guess my story got to wait until next verse

[Hook: Erika Flowers & (G-Eazy)]
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
(No lie she the apple of my eye)
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
(No lie she the apple of my eye)

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
It was a hot ass bus ride in the middle of July
But she was so cool and so fresh and so fly
So this my opportunity to try and get at her
"Is it cool if I sit?" and then a smile was her reply
I sat down and started talking to her
Be careful of what I say cause I ain’t want to sound awkward to her
Said I been peeping you but I ain’t never spoke
And I figured if I try I probably choke
Then she laughed and looked at me acting like I told a joke
And said "Joke for what? Lighten up, real talk I been trying"
And plus I always see you with him and she laughed again
But what she said next took me for a spin

[Bridge: Erika Flowers]
I saw you on stage never thought you looked my way
Waiting for a shooting star every night of everyday
To wish for a chance to bite the apple of my eye
Forbidden juices had me so weak

[Hook: Erika Flowers & (G-Eazy)]
