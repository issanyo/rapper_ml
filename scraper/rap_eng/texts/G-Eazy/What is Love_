[Chorus: Seriyus SR.]

What is love?

I don't know what that means...

I came in this world by myself, thats all I need...

Everything you put me through.. all that shit you did ...

For my whole life, that's hard to forgive .....



[Verse 1: G-Eazy]

See...when I was younger, Mama told me, that the world wouldn't be good for me....

So I had to worry bout myself... just my lonely...

But only if I had known...

Maybe I wouldn't have roamed, looking round for an answer, while no daddy's 'round at home...

Or maybe it's because of all the drugs he was on, that he couldn't show no love to his own?

Two children and a family...

Got me askin, 'Why you always mad at me'?...

Yellin, screamin, pickin up shit, and throw it at me, but...

I grew up and got stronger...

Couldn't take it no longer... then became a man, and I ain't need a father, I mean....

Why even bother if nobody got no love for you?

Then why Imma worry about them?....

They wouldn't die for you!

They wouldn't try for you!

Take a bullet wound or two?

If you pass away tomorrow, they wouldn't even cry for you! but never, ever, would I let that make me less of a man! because my plan is to be better than him, when I'm a dad!



[Chorus: Seriyus Sr.]

What is love?

I don't know what that means...

I came in this world by myself, thats all I need...

Everything you put me through.. all that shit you did ....

For my whole life, that's hard to forgive .....



[Chorus: G-Eazy]

What is love?

I don't know what that means...

I came in this world by myself, thats all I need...

Everything you put me through.. all that shit you did ...

For my whole life, that's hard to forgive .....



[Verse 2: Seriyus Sr.]

Growing up, I used to dream for something close to a change....

And with every second and every other blink, it seemed fake....

In due time... I realize, that love was nothing but a word....

If god made it for a reason.... "why'd he make it so it hurts?"...

And if with every second that passed, They say your family is there...

Supposed to respect them to an extent....but ain't ever supposed to be scared...

Because blood's supposed to be there;

Ready to take wounds...

And when it comes to guns, what you doin, when your mother's the one shootin?...

I wouldn't make it, but look now.....

I made it to a man!

And I don't call, cause I don't need you...that's something you gotta understand!

You 'love me' is bullshit...whats love got to do with it?

If your mama's the one that told you, that love don't even matter!

All the bruises and all the markings, it's just something without excuses

But the scarrings you brought up, had me worried to even do shit...

Cause if I would've made a move..... I could have made the wrong one!

But maybe me holding on kept me alive in the long run, let's go!



[Chorus: Seriyus SR.]

What is love?

I don't know what that means...

I came in this world by myself, thats all I need...

Everything you put me through.. all that shit you did ...

For my whole life, that's hard to forgive .....



[Chorus: G-Eazy]

What is love?

I don't know what that means...

I came in this world by myself, thats all I need...

Everything you put me through.. all that shit you did ...

For my whole life, that's hard to forgive .....
