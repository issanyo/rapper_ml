[Intro]
Yeah, Yeah, Let's go
I've got some homework to do that I prolly should be doing right now
But I feel like I'm gettin' more out of life doing this shit

[Hook: Matt & Kim]
So many books that I didn't read (So many books that I've never read)
But theres so much air I chose to breathe (I've been all over the world)
How about the colors that I've seen (If you could see what I've seen)
So I'll leave these pages in the trees

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
And with all due respect to my professors
Fuck school, as of now this my conjecture
I learned from adventures
More than I learned from your lectures
And I only put in effort to alleviate the pressure
I'm talkin' 'bout the pressure that society applies
Go to school, get a job, then retire, then he dies
I'd rather live fast than be entirely surprised
They tell me I should plan ahead, then I would be wise
What 'bout a rainy day? What can a cyclone store?
To turn the rain to sunshine I'm known for
They tell me if I stay in school, I'd grow more
But still ain't made a good case, iPhone 4

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
And I just want to live my own life instead of living yours
I mean, isn't that what free will is given for?
My lifestyle's changin' now, I'm stayin busy more
This time last week I was openin' the Drizzy tour
Shameless plug, but word up that shit was cool
On the road for about a month skippin' school
Till I check my inbox and my teacher wrote
"Can't miss another class and still pass." This is a joke
This opportunity was huge
Teacher why you hatin' on me now, what a douche
You mean I gotta leave this fun trip
And all these fools I hung wit
Only simply to return back to this fuckin' dumb shit

[Hook: Matt & Kim]
Books that I didn't read (So many books that I've never read)
But theres so much air I chose to breathe (I've been all over the world)
How about the colors that I've seen (If you could see what I've seen)
So I'll leave these pages in the trees

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
The real world's what he faces
Fuck a classroom, I learn more going places
Tryna gain information
Refuse to let college stand in the way of education
Word. Teachers say thats just my point of view
But I'll still be in debt when I'm 32
So wait, You mean to tell me that if i stay in school
I could maybe grow up to be just like you

[Hook: Matt & Kim]
