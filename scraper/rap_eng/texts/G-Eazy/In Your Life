[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby girl, if you dont mind (if you don’t mind)
I got a suggestion, that just might help you get that stress off your mind (stress of your mind, you need)
Guess it will help you
Girl lemme help you put this dick in your life (baby, you need)
You need this dick, baby, you need this dick in your life (baby, you need)
You need this dick, baby

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Yeah, uh, I'm just saying, G
Your lifestyle's what I'm trying to improve
Come smash, then food, dirtbag, been rude
I couldn't find a fuck to give, I'm all out
Run through rubbers and whiskey, I mob out
Yeah, all the way from the bay to the moon
I just met her, I bet I'll be bae to her soon
Sometimes I'm presumptuous, I maybe assumed to much
Till she say come through, walk straight to her room
Doom, slay, new bae
In the club, going up, Tuesday
She handed me her phone and request I put me in it
So I put a G in it, tomorrow I'll be in it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby girl, if you dont mind (if you don’t mind)
I got a suggestion, that just might help you get that stress off your mind (stress of your mind, you need)
Guess it will help you
Girl lemme help you put this dick in your life (baby, you need)
You need this dick, baby, you need this dick in your life (baby, you need)
You need this dick, baby

[Verse 2: Iamsu!]
Good everywhere, ain’t a state I can’t go
All the way to hollywood and fuck a hood ho
From the back, from the front, get it from the side
Tell me if you if your down if you not, girl make up your mind
From the Bay, we don't play, always on that grind
Money on my mind that's why these hoes up on my line
So it's long flights, long night, so I'ma take my time
With the game man, 'cause its dangerous, blow your mind
Any situation, I'ma get it how I live
Hit her with that dope dick, she love the way I whip
So, I'ma lay with it and let her play with it
Dick will change you life, girl, I make you stay with it, ay

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby girl, if you dont mind (if you don’t mind)
I got a suggestion, that just might help you get that stress off your mind (stress of your mind, you need)
Guess it will help you
Girl lemme help you put this dick in your life (baby, you need)
You need this dick, baby, you need this dick in your life (baby, you need)
You need this dick, baby

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Never trust a nigga, nigga steady flexin', yeah
Fake homies runnin' round tryna fuck my ex bitch (haha)
Thats the way the game go, on to the next bitch
Xans in the morning, pouring syrup like its breakfast (yeah)
Hol' up, hol' up, what you thinkin' I'm finished?
I keep goin' and goin' like a run on sentence
You should see my dick, yeah i ain't talk in a minute
Yelling oh my god, but she feel like sinning

Molly got you up thats a legendary high (high)
That's why you need this dick, so get this dick up in your life (ah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby girl, if you dont mind (if you don’t mind)
