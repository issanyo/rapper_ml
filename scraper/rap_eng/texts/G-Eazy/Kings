[Intro]
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Yeah, so roll one on some chill shit
I was deep asleep, on my Kill Bill shit
But now I'm back for it all tryna steal shit
You should know my fans are the ones I keep it real with
Word, that's the reason I'm still afloat
You were treading water while I went to build a boat
Fool, you would probably drown in a little moat
I'm G-O-A-T, you're a billy goat

[Hook]
I know I've been gone a long time
I'm back and I want what is mine
I know I've been gone a long time
I'm back and I want what is mine

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Uh, I'm just a hero that was unsung
But in time they will see I'm truly someone
But don't mistake it though, it's love where I come from
Work I put in that could never be undone
I gotta move, man, this movement you begun one?
My whole team on my back weighing one ton
And I've been burning heavy ever since blunt one
Ask about plan B that's a tough one
But as long as I can catch a flight home
To a sold out show full of fans then I'm on
That's why I know I'll find a fortune that's suitable
And live like a king, everyday life's beautiful

[Hook]
I know I've been gone a long time
I'm back and I want what is mine
I know I've been gone a long time
I'm back and I want what is mine
