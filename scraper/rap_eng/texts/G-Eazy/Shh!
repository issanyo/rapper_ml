[Intro]
I don't, I don't rap if the beat don't pound
Shh! Shh!
Yea, yea, yea, yea
I don't rap if the beat don't pound
I don't, I don't rap if the beat don't pound
G-Eazy, yea
I don't, I don't rap if the beat don't pound
I don't, I don't, I don't rap if the beat don't pound
Hello

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
It's the hardest working rapper I'mma do it until you're tired of me
Catch me in the lab with a pad and a fire beat
Purpell Treez and a session working privately
The endo, show love, and the babes what inspires me
Now I'm cross the country, all these labels want to hire me
I'll probably sign a deal, blow the budget, let them fire me
Take that and run do my promo virally
I'll write it, and record it, and produce it entirely
But I can't help to think about the irony
I drop mixtapes to embrace all the piracy
Shit I'm just out to get my notoriety
And give Hip-Hop just a little more variety
The little dude goes hard, yup this is true
And this beat feels like someone is kicking you
Flying high about to blow like a missile do
Now everybody shut the fuck up like I'm shushing you

[Hook]
Shh! don't make no sound
This is the part where the beat breaks down
Shh! don't make no sound
This is the part where the beat breaks down
Shh! don't make no sound
This is the part where the beat breaks down
Shh! don't make no sound
This is the part where the beat breaks down

[Bridge]
I don't rap if the beat don't pound
I don't, I don't rap if the beat don't pound
(OS) I don't, I don't rap if the beat don't pound
(YM) I don't, I don't, I don't rap if the beat don't pound

[Verse 2: OSYM]
Like a library how I'm dropping knowledge
Pennies for your thought like I got a hole in my wallet
Or pocket if the beat don't pound, nigga drop it
I rock it a cappella, develop better my concepts
Nonsense, these rap crap niggas no contest
Lyrical warfare, each "uh" is a bombshell
It's awesome, awesome, sicker than your average
Your boy could kill your album with two lines filled with ad-libs
Ain't talking about a bad dis I'm talking about decent
Sun god flow sent [?] is nearly reaping
As a recent I burn across sheets like Ku-Klux
Drop a duce and this bodicious dissing is proof of
I'm the [?] over mouth stress and quite down
Ain't a game, they just scrimmage my image when I'm in town
I pleaded my case, you be the judge, who's winning now
The Don flame on G go ahead tell them to simmer down

[Hook]
Shh! don't make no sound
This is the part where the beat breaks down
Shh! don't make no sound
This is the part where the beat breaks down
Shh! don't make no sound
This is the part where the beat breaks down
Shh! don't make no sound
This is the part where the beat breaks down

[Outro]
I don't rap if the beat don't pound
I don't, I don't rap if the beat don't pound
I don't, I don't rap if the beat don't pound
I don't, I don't, I don't rap if the beat don't pound
