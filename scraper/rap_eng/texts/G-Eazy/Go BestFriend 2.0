[Intro]
I don't know what it is
But, this 2X music
Just does something to me
Jahlil Beats, holla at me

[Pre-Chorus]
We in the club goin' dumb (goin' dumb)
All those freaks, tell 'em come (tell 'em come)
Girl, I sing that song "Don't Run" (don't run)
You-you-you, want a shot, take some (take some)
Baby girl, where your man at? (Where your man at?)
Please tell me, where your friends at? (Where your friend?)
Oh, you alone? Fuck your friends then (ah)
'Cause I was lookin' for a best friend

[Chorus: Casanova]
Get it, get it, go best friend
Get it, get it, go best friend
Get it, get it, go best friend
Get it, get it, go best friend

[Verse 1: Casanova]
Comin' in the club with me, you walk right inside the spot
But then you gotta drop it like it's hot
So show me your little dance moves
You ain't gotta be a good girl, this ain't classrooms, just show me what that ass do
So get the money, you know cash rules
Fuck a hotel, I'm tryna fuck you in the bathroom
You know them Scorpios is freaks (ah)
Got a different girl, everyday of the week
Shout out to them girls that like to eat
Nah, baby girl, I ain't talkin' no Phillippe
I'm talkin' skeet, skeet, skeet, brr
Pull up on that ass like beep, beep, beep

[Pre-Chorus: Casanova]
We in the club goin' dumb (goin' dumb)
All those freaks, tell 'em come (tell 'em come)
Girl, I sing that song "Don't Run" (don't run)
You-you-you, want a shot, take some (take some)
Baby girl, where your man at? (Where your man at?)
Please tell me, where your friends at? (Where your friend?)
Oh, you alone? Fuck your friends then (ah)
'Cause I was lookin' for a best friend

[Chorus: Casanova]
Get it, get it, go best friend
Get it, get it, go best friend
Get it, get it, go best friend
Get it, get it, go best friend

Bottle in my hand, swisher lit is how I grew up
Always cross faded, drinkin' Henny 'til I threw up (ah)
Trendin' topic, ain't nobody bringin' you up (ayy)
Yeah, I see the bag, then go get it (go get it)

[Verse 3: Rich the Kid]
Ooh, I was looking for her best friend (best friend)
