[Verse 1: Goody Grace]
She don't hit me up anymore, no
Things that were fun just ain't fun anymore, no
Six in the morning I know I should go home
But I'm
High as fuck and the clock's screaming tick-tock
Girls in the suburbs singing Smiths songs
I know that it's wrong
I don't know what I'm doin, but

[Pre-Chorus: Goody Grace]
Maybe one day it'll all make sense
Maybe one day it'll all make sense
Maybe one day it'll all make sense
But I just don't know when
And it feels like the end
And all of my friends
Said

[Chorus: Goody Grace & (G-Eazy)]
That I should get my mind off of the wrong things
I should probably tear off all my heart strings
You can't pull them no more (you know? ayy)
Maybe one day it'll all make sense (yee, ayy, yeah)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Six A.M. on Persian rugs
It's just me and her on drugs
We dip, we had to swerve the clubs
Paranoid, all on our own
We just tryna be alone
But we don't ever feel alone, 'cause people always watchin' (yeah)
Know this feels apocalyptic
People, they could not predict it
They just bein' optimistic, fuck 'em (yeah)
Listenin' to the pixies 'til we drunk off all this whiskey
Now we lay here, and it's only you and I
Where we go from here?
Fuck it, life's so simple
This what I'm into, if you don't understand, maybe I'm mental
I know I'm crazy (ayy)
You don't know what I been through
That text that I sent you, might have been drunk, but that message I meant to
Just got deleted, should have said the real shit
To be continued (ayy)

[Verse 3: Goody Grace]
I got a little water bottle full of whiskey
Oh you lookin pretty like a model you should kiss me
You so cool with your drugs and your ripped jeans
I'm with you, but you ain't with me, (no, no)

[Chorus: Goody Grace]
Maybe one day it'll all make sense
But I just don't know when
And it feels like the end
And all of my friends, said

[Outro: Goody Grace]
That I should get my mind off of the wrong things
I should probably tear off all my heart strings
You can't pull them no more
