[Intro: Myles]
P-Lo, time to bring the bass back

[Hook: Kool John]
Is it cause the ice up on my wrist that's why you mad?
Is it cause the way I took your bitch that's why you mad?
Is it cause the way I stack this cash that's why you mad?
Is it cause the way I do my dance that's why you mad?
My nigga, why you mad? My nigga, why you mad?
My nigga, why you mad? My nigga, why you mad?

[Verse 1: Kool John]
Yeah, that nigga he mad
See my ex, that bitch, she mad
I done pulled up sum' lookin' like a Jag
Told her, come over, straight cash
My bitch rocking Chanel, I’m rocking money bags
I see her finna hit the pole when I see the flash
I’m on the road to get some money like a taxi cab
You can find me in a Beamer on Mcdonald ave
Man I used to be broke and people used to laugh
I see them people walkin', I'm smashin' on the gas
I’m a money addict, I'm smokin’ on the radish
And when you getting love, the haters automatic
I done took a nigga bitch and he lookin' maddish
I done pulled a bad bitch, she fuck me for my status
Man the gang wildin’, I’m higher then a pilot
I see you niggas takin' notes while your bitches watchin'

[Hook: Kool John]
Is it cause the ice up on my wrist that's why you mad?
Is it cause the way I took your bitch that's why you mad?
Is it cause the way I stack this cash that's why you mad?
Is it cause the way I do my dance that's why you mad?
My nigga, why you mad? My nigga, why you mad?
My nigga, why you mad? My nigga, why you mad?

[Verse 2: P-Lo]
P-Lo!
Tell me why you mad, why you really mad
I done took your bitch, you can't get her back
Yeah she gone, yeah she really gone
Haters talkin' down cause I'm really on
I'm too real
I'm on my shit, can't stop
Old girls, too mad they can't watch
Gold teeth in my mouth, see me shine
I'm Lil Stunna, all I do is big time
I'm mobbin', yeah I'm mobbin', I'm really mobbin'
Big thang, use a Magnum for my condom
I get cash, it's the only thing on my conscience
Hbk, Shmoplife be the sponsor
Uh, they wanna see me fall off
Every time I got a show them girls call off
They really tryna see the dad
She give me brain and she don't need to pay
[Hook: Kool John]
Is it cause the ice up on my wrist that's why you mad?
Is it cause the way I took your bitch that's why you mad?
Is it cause the way I stack this cash that's why you mad?
Is it cause the way I do my dance that's why you mad?
My nigga, why you mad? My nigga, why you mad?
My nigga, why you mad? My nigga, why you mad?

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Yee! Yee! haha
Too much salt in your diet
I can’t walk through the mall without causin' a riot
I could barf on a CD and they’d line up to buy it
Haters killing themselves, you should probably try it
When you really get fly, you start rufflin' feathers
Man, I can’t stand the fakes like what's up with pretenders?
Got a couple things going, yeah, a couple endeavors
A couple side pieces,  yeah, a couple whenevers
What you mad for? I just excel and I gas more
You should chase girls less and focus on your cash more
Been around the universe and sold out my last tour
And just keep in mind I got a stamps on my passport
Fast forward, retired you ain’t built for this stuff
Pass the bottle, she said how the hell you drinkin' this stuff
Yeah, they gon' pull your car if they think it’s a bluff
If they don't hate you then your not doing nothin' different enough

My nigga, why you mad? My nigga, why you mad?
