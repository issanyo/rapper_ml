[Intro: Caleborate]
We just want it all
Uh, I'll take my keys off

[Chorus: Caleborate]
We just want it all, and we want that extra too
Baby show me love, when I mob like I'm kin to you
I be on my job, like I'm in an interview
Cause we just want it all
We just want it all, and some extra too
Baby show me love, when I mob like I'm kin to you
I be on my job, like I'm in an interview
Cause we just want it all

[Verse 1: Caleborate]
We just want it all, cause we came from nothing
No like really I mean nothing
I was sleeping on that couch
Yeah we up to something, like bad kids with substitutes
Teach you how to run this game, come over and watch me move
Come over and watch me do, cause everybody looking
I'm like yup, used to pay for shows now everybody booking
I'm like girl, if you basic I could probably be your basic dude
Listen to me speak my mind, I bet I enlighten you
I bet all these niggas you running with don't run with you
I bet you niggas be fronting and ask you for dirty pictures
See I ask you for pictures, I do it but I'm tasteful
And I'm soulful, still gonna want some ass baby I'm still a nigga
These niggas lack the passion they more concerned with the swag
And know this, they see the bay is coming up
They like "what happened?"
See a little skinny jean wearing bald head nigga
At the shows and at the club where everyone rocking with them
Bitch I'm still here like I never left, hella good I'm finna be the best
I come to a show and be the unknown, shut that shit down
They like "who is this?" because I do this shit
Love this shit like I birth it
Love this shit like any nigga standing
Tryna take it from me ain't worth it
Do this shit for my momma and my daddy
Gotta pay them what they loan me
And my homies gotta eat because they always believed in me
For my momma and my daddy
Gotta pay them what they loan me
And my homies gotta eat because they always believed in me

[Chorus: Caleborate]
We just want it all, and some extra too
Baby show me love, when I mob like I'm kin to you
I be on my job, like I'm in an interview
Cause we just want it all
We just want it all, and some extra too
Baby show me love, when I mob like I'm kin to you
I be on my job, like I'm in an interview
Cause we just want it all

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
We just want it all, because I need enough to share
With the homies never will I forget where I'm from I swear
That's the plan, wouldn't understand if you don't come from there
Try and clip my wings, I'm growing out another pair
We just want it all, cause that weak shit has to die
I shot for the stars I went pass the sky
Made it to uncharted heights
Might just have to go have NASA classify where I'm at
Along the way, hard times we will laugh and cry
Lost my girl when she asked the guy
If I was still in love, couldn't tell a lie
So end it with a sad goodbye
I gotta be great babe, I'm working cause they're after my
Spot I gotta go the hardest only way to satisfy
My drive to be the greatest
I rode that AC transit now I'm shining in the latest
It's time for me to say this, I'm the cleanest
Rhyming in this cadence
And word to the homie Sean, finally I'm famous
Fuck I worked so damn long, this is not a sad song
This an anthem for all of my folks trying to advance on
I'm rapping long as Lil B still got his vans on
But enough of me, Caleb sing this damn song

[Chorus: Caleborate]
We just want it all, and some extra too
Baby show me love, when we mob like I'm kin to you
I be on my job, like I'm in an interview
Cause we just want it all
We just want it all, and some extra too
Baby show me love, when we mob like I'm kin to you
I be on my job, like I'm in an interview
Cause we just want it all

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Caleborate]
We just want it all, and we want some extra too
Baby show me love, when I mob like I'm kin to you
I be on my job, like I'm in an interview
Cause we just want it all
We just want it all, and we want some extra too
Baby show me love, when I mob like I'm kin to you
Cause I be on my job, like I'm in an interview
Cause we just want it all
I said we just want it all, and we want some extra too
Baby show me love, when I mob like I'm kin to you
Cause I be on my job, like I'm in an interview
Cause we just want it all

[Outro]
We just want it all
We just want it all
We just want it
We just want it all
We just want it
We just want it all
We just want it
We just want it all
We just want it
We just want it all and we want that extra too
Baby show me love, when I mob like I'm kin to you
Cause I be on my job, like I'm in an interview
Cause we just want it all
We just want it all
We just want it all
We just want it all
We just want it all
We just want it all
