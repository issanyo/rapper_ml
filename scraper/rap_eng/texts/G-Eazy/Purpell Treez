[Chorus: G-Eazy]
Catch wiffs go and sniff that breeze
When I light up me purple trees
I peace out once my space ship leaves
When I light up me purple trees
Are you coming along let me know
Before I light up me purple dro
And to the moon blast off lets go
As I light up me purple dro

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Excuse me may I have your attention?
Allow me to put my two cents in
I have something important to mention
Yo its 4:19 on the clock bro and that's when
We smoke out,  somebody grab a swisher split
That thang open get the weed broke out
And get it all in every bit I ain't wastin' shit
You see this here we got is a relationship
When I was thirteen I fell hard for you
You the one that taught me to hit it hard for you
You're so attractive the aroma you carry
Got some chicks on the side but I'm in love with you mary
And when we hook up you relieve that stress
You know whats up when I come round
Uhh I'm bout to put you in this tight brown dress
And me and you are bout to get DOWN

[Chorus: G-Eazy]
Catch whiffs go and sniff that breeze
When I light up me purple trees
I peace out once my space-ship leaves
When I light up me purple trees
Are you coming along let me know
Before I light up me purple dro
And to the moon blast off let's go
As I light up me purple dro

[Verse 2: Noon]
Hold on I’m just buzzin'
Breakin' on the dutch about to roll me another l’
Mary and her mother, grandaddy and cousin
No trees go undiscovered I’m marijuana’s Columbus
Floatin to a new world feelin' like I'm dumber but
I’m high school high I took courses in the summer
I’m torchin’ when the sun up, I’m blazin' when the sun down
Just know I stay built every time you see me come ‘round
Damn I be lit like a halogen
I spark it and I let it burn slow I ain't a fire-man
Eyes low, shawty ask me where the bottle went
But I don’t drink shit I'm on budwiser and [?]
Yeah so you know I’m on
It might take a week for me to fall out my zone
Yeah I blow to every [?] gone
And when the box run out I’m blowing out my bowl

[Chorus: G-Eazy]
Catch whiffs go and sniff that breeze
When I light up me purple trees
I peace out once my space-ship leaves
When I light up me purple trees
Are you coming along let me know
Before I light up me purple dro
And to the moon blast off let's go
As I light up me purple dro

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
The homie josh came through with a baggie
Asked me if I was tryna chief said hell yeah gladly
Broke his bag down and said bro wanna match me?
Mmh that's what I was thinkin' exactly
I’m supposed to go to class now I’m reakin'
Eyes look bleedin' cause I couldn’t wait til the weekend
I’m smokin' on the daily, I swear I keep trying
To quit and get focused or my teacher gon' fail me
About to get my 16th tardy this month
When you’re dumb high naturally you miss stuff
I’m sittin' in the back of the class fucked up
Jottin' in my rhyme book mad bored this sucks
After this I’m headed to the lab you already know
Teacher keeps staring down at me like I bet he knows
Spend my afternoon chillin blowin' purple trees
G-g-god-damn, this weed stronger than Hercules

[Chorus: G-Eazy]
Catch whiffs go and sniff that breeze
When I light up me purple trees
I peace out once my space-ship leaves
When I light up me purple trees
Are you coming along let me know
Before I light up me purple dro
And to the moon blast off let's go
As I light up me purple dro
