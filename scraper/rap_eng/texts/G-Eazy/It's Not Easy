[Hook: G-Eazy & Kermit the Frog]
(It's not that easy being green)
It's crazy when this shit happens
(Seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things)
When you want to be amazing
(It's it's not easy being green)
Just stuck at this level
(People tend to pass you over cause you're)
You have no idea if somebody takes that shit cause
(Not standing out like stars in the sky)
Anyway

[Verse 1]
Um, for example
Chillin' I was flipping through my mom's CDs
I found this ill sample
A song by The Kinks, I found it ironic
That they hid the whole fact that the song was about chronic
Or maybe that it wasn't, the times were all different
Figured it'd be cool to chop it up and try to flip it
Make a tree anthem this shit was opportune
Change lazing into blazing on a sunny afternoon
Then it sat for a year, until I finally found it
Called Mod Sun to hop on it and it sounded
Like an ill ass song when it finally got finished
Threw that shit up on The Outsider they was fucking with it
A month passed by I was chilling 4/20
I seen this new song on all the blogs sounded funny
They stole my whole shit, sampled it the same
But it didn't fucking matter because he had a bigger name

[Hook: G-Eazy & Kermit the Frog]
(It's not that easy being green)
So they didn't know like, I did it first, you know
(Seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things)
But, but shit happens you know
(It's it's not easy being green)
You just wanna be at that level
(People tend to pass you over cause you're)
Fuck it you know what I mean
(Not standing out like stars in the sky)

[Verse 2]
It was early spring or like late fall
Around the time when Mel put me on with Jai Paul
Shit was hella fuckin' dope, so I had to sample it
Shit was too easy came together like a laminate
To be quite honest, it didn't take much
Cause the shit was dope as fuck
Before I even tried to touch it
All I needed really was to think about a subject
Wrote some shit, record it, everybody said they loved it
Couldn't really push it, cause I ain't have a budget
Tried to clear the sample so I put it out and dumped it
Called the song Kings, it was easy to relate to
Just some chill shit you can roll up and bake to
Knew we should have cleared it, should have spoke it up more
Until the song was sampled by the guy I opened up for
On his last tour, like can I catch a break
Shit it might not have mattered but his middle name was Drake

[Hook: G-Eazy & Kermit the Frog]
(It's not that easy being green)
This is not a diss song at all man
(Seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things)
Its just the irony of how it all pans out
(It's it's not easy being green)
I want to be big
(People tend to pass you over cause you're)
Shit happens
(Not standing out like stars in the sky)
Shrug life

[Outro]
You know I made this beat this morning
Right after I found like the drake song and shit
I was like yo, Let me talk about this shit
Endless Summer coming soon
