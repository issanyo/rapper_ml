[Verse 1: Mansa]
New bitch got a handle on me
She going to keep it real with the camera on me
Riding with the wave, I got so much wave
Swear that shit is crazy like a pandemoni
I'm just saying
I ain't sorry for the people that ain't stay down while I was down
I would make amends with you but I ain't friends with you
I'm on an up right now

[Bridge: Mansa]
Upset, upset
No I ain't upset
I was worried about the money while they worried about the rest
I ain't worried about my old girl, onto the next
I be onto the next, Yeah

[Chorus: Mansa]
And baby I ain't sorry
I got too much pride in my body
Hit the red button every time you call me
Because I don't want to talk to you
Nah baby I ain't sorry
I got too much pride in my body
Hit the red button every time you call me
Because I don't want to talk to you

[Verse 2: Mansa]
New friends want a handle on me
They gonna keep it lit like a candle on me
Thinking bout the days, I ain't have it those days
I ain't have it, I was solo, I ain't had no homies
Lord forgiveness for the niggas that abandoned on me
They'll regret it when they see how many bands is on me
I dont need to hear excuses from the people that ain't stay around
Now I'm screaming, "Fuck yo ass, I'm next year homie."

[Bridge: Mansa]
Upset, upset
Yeah I been upset
I've been dealing with depression
Ive been repping for the set
Switched up on my old girl, only for the sex
'Cuz my ex was on that girl
But new my girl was on that X

[Chorus: Mansa]
And baby I ain't sorry
I got too much pride in my body
Hit the red button every time you call me
Because I don't want to talk to you (Uh)
Nah baby I ain't sorry
I got too much pride in my body
I hit it the red button every time you call me (You know)
Because I don't want to talk to you

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah
You say i broke your heart in two, I'm unapologetic
Go run and call the medic
I'm working working so we all can get it
Something wasn't working, it was all aesthetic
We looked nice but couldn't function
Said it all, I meant all
So now
I'm missing calls and I'm ignoring texts
Finally winning, Im been scoring checks
Check the touring schedule see which country I'm exploring next
I'm out in Paris on my foreign flex
Realized I am more than blessed
Call with drama I hit decline
The bullshit I'm tryna leave it behind
Needed peace of mind, so I hit you with a peace sign
I dont feel the need to rewind
I just need good weed and me time
So yeah
I'm full of pride
Some of it the foolish kind
Some of it deserved
How I came up I was full of grind
They tell you different then they fully lied
Foot is on a pedal and you'll never ever see the day my foot aside

[Chorus: Mansa & G-Eazy
And baby I ain't sorry
I got too much pride in my body (Eazy)
Hit the red button every time you call me
Because I don't want to talk to you (Can't do it) (I'm sorry)
Nah baby I ain't sorry
I got too much pride in my body (Yah)
Hit the red button every time you call me (You know)
Because I don't want to talk to you

[Outro: Mansa]
Sorry
Yeah baby, I ain't sorry
Yeah, turn around, turn around now
How does it feel, baby
When things turn around on the turn around
I'm on an up right now, you've been down
'Cause things turn around and they turn around
