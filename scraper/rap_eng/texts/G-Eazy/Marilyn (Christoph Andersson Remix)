I, I, I, I, I want to love you
But if it's not right what can I do?
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, I want to love you
But if it's not right what can I do?
I, I, I, I, I want to love you
But if it's not right what can I do?
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby get some sleep tonight
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby get some sleep tonight

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, I want to love you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby get some sleep tonight
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby get some sleep tonight
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, I want to love you
