[Chorus: Tommy Genesis]
Yeah it really ain't enough
If it ain't a millie ain't enough
Yeah it really ain't enough
Pop another pille ain't enough (Yee!)

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Like everyday I'm fucking up rodeo

She just really wanna mob around with Gerald
And this sauce is rid is bottle not for sale
Hundred Trillion Pesos Hundred Trillion Pesos
Got A Hundred Trillion Pesos
I be spendin' money everyday though, if they ain't know
They broke but it's OK tho
Like what you tryna' say though?

[Bridge]
Set it off the level, takin' off (x3)
You ain't had your sister laid enough

[Chorus: Tommy Genesis]
Yeah it really ain't enough
If it ain't a millie ain't enough
Yeah it really ain't enough
Pop another pille ain't enough
Yeah it really ain't enough
Send another dealer ain't enough
Yeah it really ain't enough
Yeah it really ain't enough

[Verse 2: Jozzy]
Multiply that shit
And I freeze my wrist (wrist)
Motorboat that bitch (brr)
Motorsport my whip (hmm)
New sleeves and ships
Lifestyle of the rich
Lifestyle of the boss ass cool ass down ass bitch
I might be care if you look at my ho i said no
I get bored if the checks comin' slow get that girl [?] for the Lord
If she ever ever leave me then her friend comin' on
Diamonds can't be clutched, bitches let me fuck that's the power of
Sorry i don't trust
None of you hoes
None of you niggas
Most of ya'll fake
Seem full of radios
Watch out we movin' in a room full of bosses
(Watch out we movin' in a room full of bosses)

[Chorus: Tommy Genesis]
Yeah it really ain't enough
If it ain't a millie ain't enough
Yeah it really ain't enough
Pop another pille ain't enough
Yeah it really ain't enough
Send another dealer ain't enough
Yeah it really ain't enough
Yeah it really ain't enough
