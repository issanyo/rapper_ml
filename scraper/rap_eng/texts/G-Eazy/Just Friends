[Chorus: Phem]
You could leave it all behind
Sometimes being blind is fine if all you want is nothing at all
You could always try again
It hurts too much to know we've reached the end
'Cause we'll never be just friends
'Cause we'll never be just friends

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
And when I look around, I see you everywhere
I punched a hole in my wall and I just left it there
To remind me of that time I really took it there
And remind me not to start again 'cause nothing's there
'Cause if I call you that'll probably lead to somethin'
'Cause we'll probably meet to talk and then we'll probably end up fucking
We'll probably end up fighting, it's gon' be a lot of cussing
And shit can get disgusting and we're right back here at square one
And we can try be homies, but that shit ain't gon' work
Not trying to sell a dream to you, for what the fuck it's worth?
I did a lot of shit, I'm dying with my dirt
But, you still holding on, you still sleepin' in my shirt
'Cause if we open back then someone will get hurt
And shit could get dark, you ain't Courtney I'm not Kurt
Look, Life's a bitch and Father Time is undefeated
Tryna' live, it's better off to leave it
You know

[Chorus: Phem]
You could leave it all behind
Sometimes being blind is fine if all you want is nothing at all
You could always try again
It hurts too much to know we've reached the end
'Cause we'll never be just friends
'Cause we'll never be just friends

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
How you go from inseparable to not attached?
From havin' fun to these days, you don't like to laugh
Always wreck shit when you give me something I could crash
Patrick Bateman, American Psychopath
Murder you in cold blood shit is over with
I lose myself in my work it's how I cope with it
I find solace in a mansion whippin' foreigns
I don't know what's on the other side the door if I don't open it
But, yesterday you crossed my mind, then it hit me
You was down as fuck, did anything to benefit me
It's kinda fucked up, you never got to live it with me
I finally start soft and cross my mind with drinking whisky
Fucking alcohol, it's crazy we don't talk at all
I keep thinking 'bout reaching out to you to 'till I'm like knock it off
'Cause when I put the business first, I started poppin' off
But, if I kept it, then which way would I be better off?

[Chorus: Phem]
You could leave it all behind
Sometimes being blind is fine if all you want is nothing at all
You could always try again
It hurts too much to know we've reached the end
'Cause we'll never be just friends
'Cause we'll never be just friends

[Outro: G-Eazy]
From top shaped to becomin' tainted
Sharing everything to strangers livin' unacquainted
Yeah, prolly should've waited
Until we find out where we wanna take it
You know, aye
Fuck you know, yeah
