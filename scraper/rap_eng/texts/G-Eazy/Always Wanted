[Intro: PJ]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: PJ]
I bet I know why you so quiet
I think they know that we already runnin'
Tell me why they so busy plottin'?
It's kinda stupid cause we been there, done it
And I been moving, they been watchin'
Don't know the score but we already winnin'
I'm talking trends baby, I'm Diddy

[Hook: PJ]
I'm telling niggas what I always wanted
I know I'm gettin' what I always wanted
You see me gettin' what I always wanted

[Verse 2: PJ]
Some people wait for confirmation
It's sad to see, just look how far that got 'em
Sometimes I hear they conversations
Just wasting time, no I don't want those problems
This life is full of complications
But staying trill, yeah, that's the only option
And now you're lookin' at me crazy

[Hook: PJ]
I'm telling niggas what I always wanted
I know I'm gettin' what I always wanted
You see me gettin' what I always wanted

[Refrain: PJ]
Tell me up there's gon' be crazy, gon' be golden
Do you got my back? Nah, I don't know it
Tell me if you got me, you never show it
I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it
Tell me up there's gon' be crazy, gon' golden
Do you got my back? Nah, I don't know it
Tell me if you got me, you never show it
I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it

[Verse 3: G-Eazy + PJ]
Aye, they know this kid is goin' places
Thought when I made it, it'll all be so gorgeous, but...
I swear bad vibes are so contagious
Should take your hats off, work my ass off, just for this one
Trust me, I hear them conversations
But I keep getting to the money, I'm focused, yeah
I use that shit as motivation
Go in the snap and rap my ass off, just know this
I'm getting to it's 'bout time, never patient about mine
Get it now, I need it now, I go to work on my downtime
Shut down the award show, all them stars I outshine
Traded in that screen time
For that watchin' shows on my couch time
Like, like fuck a stylist, mixing Saint Laurent with Palace
My pockets eating donuts, stay the fuck away from salads
And the keys to my new crib are just as major as Khaled's
All cause I follow my talents
You see me getting what I always wanted

[Refrain: PJ]
Tell me up there's gon' be crazy, gon' be golden
Do you got my back? Nah, I don't know it
Tell me if you got me, you never show it
I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it
Tell me up there's gon' be crazy, gon' golden
Do you got my back? Nah, I don't know it
Tell me if you got me, you never show it
I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like it
