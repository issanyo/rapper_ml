[Intro]
Haha, yeah!
Haha, yee
I-I don't see nothin' wrong with-with my behavior
You know

[Hook]
If she just wanna sniff, she just looking for a lift and if we finish off a fifth, I don't see nothin' wrong
If I spend a few bands when I should have let it stack
I can make that shit back, I don't see nothin' wrong
If I smoke a whole ounce and I don't even leave the house
I could look at my accounts and I don't see nothin' wrong
I'm unapologetic, you can tell by what I'm on
If you don't like me, fuck you, this is nothin' but a song

[Verse 1]
My mama said, "judge not, yet ye be judged"
Well you don't trip, the bullshit just get skipped like a CD does
She light up more than GE does
I'm in the party just appreciatin' the molly and my Fiji buzz
Why stress, I'm too blessed to ever come down
I might be the rarest cat that's ever been found
I'm on one off the medicine now and it's a Wednesday
I'll end up fuckin' something and wake up drunk the next day
They love to talk about it, people sayin' I'm reckless
The microscope I'm under, they just love to inspect us
But fuck 'em, make them eat their words for dinner and breakfast
That shit come back around, full circle though like a necklace
Fuck outta here, I can't fit no bullshit in my agenda
If you're artificial Splenda, well then you are not a friend
I never save, I'm spending cash for as long as I remember
So I went to spend a fortune on this Porsche and not a rental

[Verse 2]
Strip club in this damn prop protection, cop blockin' at the ATM
We be going dumb until like 8AM, uh
Lana think I'm crazy, and I maybe am
Killing hella brain cells in my cranium
The realest who did it and got away with it
They pouring drugs on titties and now and everybody sniffin'
She acting shocked by it, guess we live a little different
I'm out here just mobbin' in my Oakland A's fitted
I'd never sell my soul, I stay green and gold
I knew I'd be a legend back since I was 10 years old
I knew I would be cold, his story would be told
I'ma have to fuck Jessica soon, before she gets too old (Alba)
I'll snatch her from her husband, I told you I was cold
I'm going Super Saiyan, yes I'm enterin' that mode (Hadouken)
Like Goku, I'm boastful, I'm so anti-social
The money's all I say hello to, like goddamn, that's so true

[Outro]
Haha, Beautiful and Damned, Damn
Young Gerald, this OG talk right here
I don't see nothing wrong
They don't get us Gerald, we different!
Different to her, hahaha
Doing all types of wild shit
Dogging bitches on the side of the stage
While all y'all singing our songs
Nothing wrong
Spending all this money we makin'
One shot, we don't see nothing wrong
Y'all don't understand, 'cause we do it again
Fuck it, we don't care
We don't care
All y'all who don't understand, don't fuck with us, y'all got something wrong
You know what we call y'all?
Muffins, haha
We don't see nothing wrong
