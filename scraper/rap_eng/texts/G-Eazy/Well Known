[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Look, My life's a party I'm just tryna get my fun in
While I'm young and going hard and this shit I say is stunnin'
I bust in your face just to let you know I'm comin'
And I'm balling in the Golden State I think I'm Chris Mullin
Been hearing disrespect from all these children that I'm stuntin'
For I been putting work in you ain't been putting none in
So, thinkin' hatin on me, might just get you somethin'
Are you dumb and you just wanna start some shit up off of nothing?
Look, I don't get it, you haters are pathetic
See, another man's success should only hurt you if you let it
I know you like my style and my image and aesthetic
How I put my plans in motion that's kinetic, you get it?
Look, Hating on me, bro that shit will get you nowhere
Your bitch checked into my show on her Foursquare
They like, "How he gets them hoes, though it's no fair!"
But hard work is paying big we don't need to go there

[Hook]
Only you can make you happy, oh oh
(Gettin' business more, homey fuck you trippin' for?)
Only you can make you happy, oh oh
(It's so profound, hit the stage they go wild)
Only you can make you happy, oh oh
(You rappers get ignored, I'm who they checkin' for)
Only you can make you happy, oh oh
(I'm well know now, hit the stage they go wild)

[Verse 2: KAM Royal]
All these haters on my dick like a condom is
But if they startin' shit we spark em quick like Chronic hits
The bombest chicks give me compliments, yeah it's common sense
Cause I'm coming with the Heat like Wade, Lebron, and Chris
DC boy and G-Eazy down in NOLA, when I drop my album bet it sells like Motorola
I get naked photos on my Blackberry when I'm touring yeah
I love a groupie chick cause she never questions my motives, rah
Cocaina I be coming with the dope
Tell them industry folks stay on your toes like a ballerina
I'm spitting my raps, ripping up tracks like I had cleats on it
It's a game of Simon Says, how y'all followin' leader
Bitch I'm still undefeated you ain't seen a single W
Who the fuck are you? I'm the best, no substitute
Stick with my team, perfect family like the Huxtables
Living life and I love it dude, yeeh

[Hook]
Only you can make you happy, oh oh
(Gettin' business more, homey fuck you trippin' for?)
Only you can make you happy, oh oh
(It's so profound, hit the stage they go wild)
Only you can make you happy, oh oh
(You rappers get ignored, I'm who they checkin' for)
Only you can make you happy, oh oh
(I'm well know now, hit the stage they go wild)
