[Hook: Kyle Lucas & G-Eazy]
I need a housewife to clean
And a mistress on my team
I bring that bread home
It's the American dream x2
Yeah, and I'm feeling just like Draper on the scene
Never slippin', getting caught
I always keep my business clean

[Verse 1: Kyle Lucas]
These birds all flock, eveywhere that I go
And when you in the spotlight
Hoes, they tend to follow
It's money over bitches
Yeah ho, that's still the motto
But shit I love a bad bitch who pass on the Moscato
Pullin' whiskey from the bottle, we party like it's Cabo
She dig on my bravado, turn my hotel to a brothel
See I lack the self control in terms of all these models
She says she loves the way I spit, I insist she swallow
Yeah I'm a freak that's alright
We just fuck like all night
I don't discriminate or hate
I fuck these bitches, all types
That's my civil duty, if these groupies get unruly
Shit, I cut 'em out the scene, like I'm editing a movie
I'm trying to make that bread, my flow brings the dough
It keeps me on the road, so I'm steady killin' shows
Backstage where these girls act allergic to they clothes
Shit, you know I'm down
Just keep it on the low

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kyle Lucas]
I got that down bitch that'll ride for me
Handcuffed she blindfold me, beat it up like she owe me
Okay, just breathe slowly
If it turns official, well she already know me
Best believe I'll get that pre-nup, that's some shit I learned from Kobe
Cause I'm out making the doughnuts, bringing home the bacon
All this cheese I've been raking, just to take her on vacations
Know just how I like it when she's in the kitchen bakin'
Ass out half naked, wearin' nothin' but an apron
Damn all this gossip, nosy bitches on a mission
They fixated on friction cause they always drama fishin'
They bringin' all this nonsense, girls I been dickin'
And they listin' out names, like they starting a petition
Rumors spread around town
She don't ever listen
Callin' me a dog, that's her favorite position
Then she brought her girl in, wearing nothing but a robe
Took it off told me to watch
And keep it on the low
