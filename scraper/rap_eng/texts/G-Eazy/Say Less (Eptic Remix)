[Intro]
What are you trying to say?

Yeah
Young Gerald, yeah, uh
Yah, yah, yah

[Verse 1]
Dylon, Dylon with the boom pow
Every week now I switch to a new style
Two 12s in the back just blew out
Everything I do end up in the news now

Leave the club with a few now
Just some Hollywood girls and they do chow
I'm drunk, I'm drunk in the mood now
2 AM, what you wanna do now?

[Verse 2]
Ay girl, what it do do
If you got friends, cool bring a few through
No fun if the homies can't have none
R.I.P. Nate Dogg shit is too true

And you know what I'm down for
Round two, round three, into round four
Mood switched when she knocked at the front door
Next up was the uproar, yeah

[Chorus]
That's like a week ago
But we both know how weekends go
Tryna function, got some places we could go

Lock jaw got me speakin slow like yeah
I'm blessed on blessed
I don't GAFOS
You tryna fuck?
Yes on yes on yes on yes

Say less
Say less
Say less
Say less

Yes on yes on—

[Drop]
Say less
Say less

[Pre-Drop]
Less, less, less, less, less, less, less, less, less, less, less, less, less, less, less, less, less, less...

Yes on yes on—

[Drop]
Say less
Say less

[Bridge]
Sheesh, what you sayin'? I don't understand
Goddamn, I'm out my mind, I popped another Xan
Sheesh, I swear this lock jaw got me stuttering
Goddamn, girl, you so fine, I'd fall in love again

Sheesh, gettin' faded is my favorite rush
Goddamn, you talkative, ain't gotta say too much
Be quiet, who got some grapes? I'm tryna roll some trees
Goddamn, uppers and downers, I'm off both of these

Gettin' faded, not complicated
Too sedated, no conversation
Gettin' faded, not complicated
We too sedated, no conversation

Please say less
Please say less
Please say less

[Chorus: G-Eazy]
I'm blessed on blessed
I don't GAFOS
You tryna fuck?
Yes on yes on yes on yes

[Drop]
Say less
Say less

[Outro]
I try to remember
But when everything is coming back to me, I feel as if my memory is paralyzed
What is the last thing you can remember?
I remember his voice
