Over again...

Never again, tell me you need me
If you cannot back it up
All I can say
Is you’ve been neglecting, a good thing and I - I was willing to wait
See you could’ve kept me
But gave me enough time to throw it away
The new remedy

It’s over again now
And you’re telling me you miss it baby
Just forget it all
The remedies escape the memories
Just forget me now
And you’re telling me you miss it baby just forget me now
The remedies escape it all

[G-Eazy]
And I cannot forget you, no, but neither can you
I mean, clearly, otherwise why'd you be singing this tune?
You'd be singing 'bout somebody new
Infatuation stages, then engagements, maybe they just haven't come through
You're soundin' blue, so you think back, rewind and reflect
When I fell back I was only tryna respect your space
Maybe you're like a mis-shipment, mine to collect
I might have missed you that first time around
Let's finally connect
Cause you and I both know, regardless if we both call it quits
Could never keep a drink off an alcoholic's lips
We're both addicted to each other, it's nothin' left to cover
It's understood, you'll always be that distant lover, you know

But that was just an escape
Won’t ever repeat it
Since you couldn't get me right
I'll find another guy
I'm not stressin' that
That was just my mistake
Won't ever repeat it, na
Since you cannot keep me right?
I'll find another guy

It’s over again now
And you’re telling me you miss it baby
Just forget it all
The remedies escape the memories
Just forget me now
And you’re telling me you miss it baby just forget me now
The remedies escape it all

It’s over again now
And you’re telling me you miss it baby
Just forget it all
The remedies escape the memories
Just forget me now
And you’re telling me you miss it baby just forget me now
The remedies escape it all

Escape it all (x2)
The remedies escape it all (x2)
