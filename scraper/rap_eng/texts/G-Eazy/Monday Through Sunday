[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
I wonder why I'm running round chasing it
In this up and down psycho relationship
But when it's good you know I ain't really saying shit
Attention to all the problems I ain't paying it
I'm lost in the moment cause now I feel
I would do anything if I could have it still
And ask you back out with a daffodil
Just to make you smile and we dope yo but after we'll
Resort back to arguing and bickering over stupid shit it ain't healthy yo it's sickening
You get jealous over chicks I get jealous over dudes you be with yo it's all the same shit
You need to stop tripping and listen, you'll always be different but you already know your position
A place in my heart yo you own that property
I swear we was meant to be together yo we gotta be

[Hook: Erika Flowers]
Baby I like you on Monday (I like you on Monday)
Baby I fall back in love
Baby I hate you by Wednesday
Cause baby it just ain't what it was
Baby on Friday I'll see you (baby I'll see you)
And hook back up with you then
Baby on Sunday I'll leave you until the next week
Do it all again

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I sit back with a pole of that CA
Put a flame to it and I think about you each day
Life leads us down paths somewhere we stray
Hope we get lost in the trail somewhere we stay
Forgot our direction and we were supposed to be much more but got caught in attention
And couldn't let it go for the sake of our union
And I ain't even know a little mistake it could ruin
Everything we built but I'm still attracted to you
There's a whole left wing you subtract us to
Said if I need you I can but I can't be a good friend it's all or nothing
I need you in my world, I need you as my girl
I know it sounds clich√© but I can't find the words
To put it to you any better wishing we could go back
But there's no rewind button and you know that

[Hook: Erika Flowers]
