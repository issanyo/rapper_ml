Count my blessings, not my flaws
Leveled up now I'm a boss
I double back from every loss
So worry not at all, 'cuz I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave
Watch me rise like the tide
They all want to ride the wave

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Back and forth in my head, as I debate it
Ironic you'll be surrounded, but still feel isolated
The gift and curse of celebrity, asked if I would trade it
No time for that I got work to do, so the question waited
I'm on my way up right now if you ain't knowing
But it's no directions to get to where I'm going
My life is hard to relate to, so I don't talk to no one
I'm moving like 18-wheelers, with all this weight I'm towing
I just happened to make it, I was the one to blow
Fly from Chile to Vegas, I got another show
Every night a new city, we always on the road
Get assistance from substances so it doesn't show
Breaking bread with my day ones, we out in Bogota
All cause we put the work in and follow protocol
You think you know me, you only know what I show to y'all
We want the world, coming for it all
You Know?

Leveled up now I'm a boss

So worry not at all, 'cuz I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave

They all want to ride the wave

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
My truest verses be the most vulnerable
My biggest fear is me getting comfortable
The vibe is sacred, protect it, it gets disruptable
20 people I don't know all in the studio
Just to text all their friends and say who they're chilling 'round
It's six in the morning bitch, why you still around?
If I fell off tomorrow, then would you stick around?
This money won't make itself, gotta get it now
I don't got no hobby, look all I do is work
If I feel like I'm slipping, I start to go berserk
Because they know my potential, what I'm capable of
This is my life bro, I could not make it up
Living moments they'll later put in my biopic
They watch from outside, it's crazy inside of it
Chasing dreams and I finally think I'm getting closer
For the past five years, been on this roller coaster

[Chrous: Rexx Life Raj & (G-Eazy)]
Count my blessings, not my flaws
Leveled up now I'm a boss
I double back from every loss
So worry not at all, 'cuz I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave
Watch me rise like the tide
They all want to ride the wave (one more time)

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Took care of momma
Yeah we came a long way from that Honda
Grew up on Dre, now she eat Benihana with Wanda
From the Bay, I tell ya, there's something in the water
If the offer ain't six figures, don't even bother
The view from my balcony, you have to come see this
I californicate models, feel like Anthony Kiedis
To make it in music now, you have to be genius
Chances slim as Christian Bale when he shot The Machinist
Cop the Presidential Oyster Perpetual
All because my voice is exceptional
Remember when no one understood me
I sit back and think what it could be
Life turned into everything that it should be
You know?
