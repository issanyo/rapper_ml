[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
You say we never should've been
But I disagree
So like an apple ad I simply think differently
And nah, I'm not lookin for your sympathy, but
You got my heart you know
I know last time we might've failed dismally
We both did some shit, shady as the industry
When we lock eyes, I know you feel it instantly
Despite all the history, you still got a thing for me

[Hook: Metronomy]
I told you how long we got
All the time in the world
I've got a thing for you
You've got a thing for me
I've got my mind made up
You've got my heart you know
You've got a thing for me
You've got a thing for

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Recently I've seen my daydreams vividly
Every time I space out in class, see the imagery of you and I together
Starts fucking with me visibly
Damn, that's what the fuck I get for thinking wishfully
And lately, I've been looking for some quick relief
Liberally, accepting Monica's but missing Hillary
But inside this is all causing misery
Why I ain't got you right now is a mystery

[Hook: Metronomy]
I told you how long we got
All the time in the world
I've got a thing for you
You've got a thing for me
I've got my mind made up
You've got my heart you know
You've got a thing for me
You've got a thing for me

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
So, tell me how you missin me?
Or am I absent like a Jewish familys Christmas tree?
That new dude is a phony, and he isn't me
And I bet you he don't satisfy you physically
But when we sex you experience a symphony
I conduct your body and I beat it like a timpani
For you baby, I would walk across Tennessee
But my chances were tinier than Timothy
But I never get to keep you, we weren't meant to be
We're in a different key, you just wanted middle C
I miss you love, I miss you kissin me
We broken up and gotten back together two times, but this is trilogy

[Hook: Metronomy]
I told you how long we got
All the time in the world
I've got a thing for you
You've got a thing for me
I've got my mind made up
You've got my heart you know
You've got a thing for me
You've got a thing for me
