[Verse 1: Parker Ighile]
Everything you like, everything's right
If you want more, baby
When you see me tired
All my life holdin' up a fire over to the right
Everything you like, baby
I've got a key of this, I swear
Tell me just what you seek, you need and fear
And you've never dreamed this shit right here
But it isn't free, just be aware
I see the screams between your ears
You've gotta breathe, you need some air
She said I'm coming with you, I'm feeling scared
Cause there's two little niggas on the right side calling
I’ve got them BBS’s on the ride
And you don't ever see me when I ride 'round
They don't like it, but I won't stop
Tell me how you're livin' on your block

[Pre-hook: Parker Ighile]
Ridin', straight ridin'
Call me up whenever you like it
40 cal up under that seat though
Just in case you niggas wanna get violent
Ridin', straight ridin'
Call me up whenever you like it
40 cal up under this seat though
Just in case you niggas wanna get violent

[Hook: Parker Ighile]
Oooh, this is America, I swear
Cruisin' in 85 on the 95
Nigga won't you fly, baby
Oooh, this is America, I swear
You should see the skies, anything you like
Better make your mind, baby

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, one hit, she's so in love
Feels good, I know it does
She's always tryna roll with them kind of folks who know the plugs
Kind of people who hold the drugs
Kind of people who know the clubs
Thinkin' back on that first time she got show what Loaded was
Soon as she was given a taste
Took a little, "Try some", and went numb in the face
She was used to bullshit, all stepped on and laced
You would never find this; chances as slim as her waist
Nah, see she just loves the rush it brings
So she wants to have some more
But it's not for free, baby, that's what all your cash is for
Say she likes the lifestyle, okay you can have a tour
Take her 'round the scene and then maybe make it back at four
Ridin' through the city doin' 60 in a foreign whip
Twist the top off this brown, go ahead and pour a sip
Take her down, strawberry fields, take her for a trip
But first, try some of this right here before we dip
Yeah, I gotchu
