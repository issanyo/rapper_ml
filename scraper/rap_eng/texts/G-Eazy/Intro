[Intro: Woman]
G-Eazy The Slap Doctor Presents The Epidemic

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
First off, thank you all for your patience
I know its been long awaited, anticipated
Sorry for the late start
But the man, had to put the last touches on his art
So right here, I deliver you a classic
Beats a football and the flow is gymnastic

[Hook]
It's all real 100 its no gimmick
Make it spread like epidemic
It's all real 100 its no gimmick
Make it spread like epidemic
It's all real 100 its no gimmick
Make it spread like epidemic
It's all real 100 its no gimmick
Make it spread like epidemic
It's all real 100 its no gimmick
Make it spread like epidemic

[Outro: Woman]
