[Verse 1]
Yeah, rappers try to brag about accomplishments
But nothing you've been dropping yet astonishes
Yeah, next shit I'm about to say is obvious
But criticism's worth some more than compliments
Yeah, we're living at a different speed
Trying to sprout a money tree, we started out with just a seed
Always working, never hindered by a little fatigue
Rapping in arenas, I'm still playing in a different league
Yeah, you still playing wiffle ball
Dropping opportunities I'm picking up a different call
Holding out for bigger checks to lift us all
Never kept a safety net to catch us even if I fall
Rather risk it all than play it safe
You like to sprinkle salt and player hate
My team can eat, I'll share a plate
I had the black on black, I swear you're late

[Chorus]
Everyday I got some fly shit on
Keeping all black outfit on
I already bagged most the chicks
That you out here trying to get on
You just catching up to what I've been on
Yeah, that's what I've been on

[Post-Chorus]
I see what you trying to do, that's not even kinda new
That's the shit I've been on
All these girls you see around, I already took 'em down
That's the shit I've been on
That's the shit I've been on
That's the shit I've been on

[Verse 2]
I be thinking forward though
Thinking quick and making plans, y'all be thinking sort of slow
You be thinking more bitches, I be thinking more dough
Showed them all I do this shit but trust me, I got more to show
Yeah, yeah, I'm just getting started now
All that swerve and spill my Bourbon, brody, that's a party foul
Rappers try to swear they're cool, really? I'm like "hardly, pal"
Black on black with hair slicked back, boy, I got the hardest style
And I'm always snatching chicks
Flier than Aladdin's whips
Haters on the sideline bitter, hella fucking mad he's rich
Took your darling off your arm, now she just wanna be daddy's bitch
They can't even find me where I'm chillin' like my addy switched
Yeah, breaking rules, we all bent 'em
Dreaming about these M's, told my team "let's all get 'em"
Make a classic song, last as long as raw denim
Every track's a problem, what I spit is all venom

[Chorus]
Everyday I got some fly shit on
Keeping all black outfit on
I already bagged most the chicks
That you out here trying to get on
You just catching up to what I've been on
Yeah, that's what I've been on

[Post-Chorus]
I see what you trying to do, that's not even kinda new
That's the shit I've been on
All these girls you see around, I already took 'em down
That's the shit I've been on
That's the shit I've been on
That's the shit I've been on
