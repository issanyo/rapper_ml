We’ve grown too close for that
Fuck a friend zone I know I ain’t perfect
I wonder what you’ve been on
Is you doing what I’m doing?
If you doing what I’m doing I can’t deal with it
Is you moving how I’m moving?
If you moving how I’m moving, I can’t live with it
Oh no, fuck the friend zone
Oh no, motherfuck the friend zone

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
We’re still fucking every time I’m in town
Hoes come around but you really been down
Heard through the grapevine you’re seeing him now
Looking for the one and you think he’s been found
Not true, that is not true
They could never understand what we’ve been through
Up at night thinking so I sent the text though
I’m just checking in like I hope you’ve been cool
Finishing school? that’s cool my congrats
Maybe we can finally do this at last
But these days the pace that I move at is fast
Maybe I’m just chasing what I knew in my past
Maybe this is pointless and I should probably leave you
Realize you’re living at a-whole-nother speed too
Maybe I just realized I really fucking need you
Or maybe I’ll just tell you all about it when I see you
Until then

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
And we both know we should let go
It doesn’t change the fact we keep on having sex though
Since the last time I guess if it helps though
But you’re really only lying to yourself though
Can’t resist you cause you got all the right stuff
If we was on the same page then I might cuff
They say relations don’t work for people like us
But then again we’re that crazy so it might just
And I know I still got some growing up to do
But you already know the deal this is nothing new
Yeah, you know I treat you better than most others do
I’m something different than the rest, even your mother knew
She asks about me to the point she almost smothers you
You can’t sleep you’re still up at two
So you decide to call me, I bring those rubbers through
Cause we can fuck it’s all good if you want, it’s just up to you
