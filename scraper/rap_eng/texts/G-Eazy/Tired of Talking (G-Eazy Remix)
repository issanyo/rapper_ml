[Verse 1: LÉON]
Do you sometimes let your hand slip away?
Something just feels different about you babe
Don't wanna hear about your crazy drunk night out
I don't believe that you just passed out on the couch
I can see it, something in the way you move
You're acting like there’s something left to prove
And all these lies they keep on slippin' out
I said I don't believe that you just passed out on the couch

[Pre-Chorus: LÉON]
On and on and on it goes
On and on and on it goes

[Chorus: LÉON]
Cause I've been nothing but good to you
Your howlin' into the night won't do
I'm tired of talking, talking, talking, talking
I've been nothing but good to you

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, I thought the last time was goodbye
When you said that you don't give a fuck if I
Went away forever, so we're better off severed
Sorry, I'm just not that cut and dry
So is this gray space we can't get out of
You say it's over, I keep my mouth shut
Then you came over and I'm not sober
Looking for closure until we make love
You say the same love, this is fake love
I sold you a dream and you kept the pay stub
So maybe one day we'll find the time and
Or maybe it was glitter, just confused with diamonds

[Chorus: LÉON & (G-Eazy)]
Cause I've been nothing but good to you (yes)
Your howlin' into the night won't do
And I'm tired of talking, talking, talking, talking
I've been nothing but good to you

[Bridge: LÉON]
Get out the door and disappear
When you get home I won't be here
Don't act surprised as if you cared
Don't even bother cause

[Chorus: LÉON]
I've been nothing but good to you
Your howlin' into the night won't do
And I'm tired of talking, talking, talking, talking
I've been nothing but good to you
Cause I've been nothing but good to you
Your howlin' into the night won't do
I'm tired of talking, talking, talking, talking
I've been nothing but good to you
