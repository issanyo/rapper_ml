I was always naive, You was always brave
To take another step just without a thinkinig
I was never naive, You was never brave
To take another step just without a thinkinig
I was never naive, You was never brave
To take another step just without a thinkinig
I was always naive, You was always brave
To take another step just without a thinkinig

(Verse1: G-Eazy)
Aye, it hurts the most
Now I'm like a dropshit
"Don't you do it, you'll get hurt"
But it endless, like you to mess
But If I didn't tell you
You will go ahead, and do it
Now it is the same shit, like before and after show
Yeah, you talk to me, cause' you love me
You tell me, give me chance
To say be, and play a dance
But love is big, love is risk
I have to think, I'm not a floppy disk
Poppy is shit, her name isn't thist
Slowly I'm fallin' love, I forgot my name
What It was, then, what It is
I think I found, It was Misk

I'm not in cave, we're on a streets
To protest fo him, with my friend Jim
Yoo, I got 21, he 29

To take another step just without a thinkinig
