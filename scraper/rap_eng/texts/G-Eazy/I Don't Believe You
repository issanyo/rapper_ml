[Hook: Team Robot]
Got some killer in my swisher
And my bitch got the prescription
My eyes closed cause I'm driftin'
I'm so high I might go missin'
Girl I know you smoke that fire
But this right here that diesel
And I know you think you faded, but
Bitch I don't believe you, no
Bitch I don't believe you, no
Bitch I don't believe you
Girl I know you think you faded but
Bitch I don't believe you, no
Bitch I don't believe you, no
Bitch I don't believe you
Girl I know you think you faded but
Bitch I don't believe you

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
I got hoes at my shows it's mania like I'm a Beatle
Call Lou he brought some weed through
Man the session was so lethal
Man last night was a movie
And every night we sequel
You don't turn up like we do
Say you do?
I don't believe you
It's, four in the morning I'm looking for drugs
Already faded increasing my buzz
Working it off I'll be at the clubs
Every weekend this is what I does
I know that you think that you party like us in a similar fashion
But I spent a rack on these jeans that I'm holding my stash in
Snatching your hoes then I'm smashin'
I'm higher than you can imagine
Pray that I don't see no polices flashin'
Cause I'm riding through the city
Rolling up sticky
A bad bitch with me and we both getting trippy

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
She said she drink lean
Bitch I don't believe you, no
I don't believe you, no
Bitch I don't believe you, no
She said she's eighteen
Bitch I don't believe you, no
I don't believe you, no
You need to go
Most of you rappers swear that you're on
Like really? come on
You swear up and down you're the illest alive and you kill every song
I'm sorry, you're wrong
You see, you're drought and we only see floods
We only bought premium drugs
Meanwhile your dealer is selling you bullshit stepping all on it like rugs
Every night whiskey and beer
I been on tour for a year
If I'm at a party then you know the Marley and bitches will surely appear
All of my homies in here
Pull hoes and then disappear
I'm fucking yo girl while we look in the mirror
Skeet all over her back and leave a souvenir
