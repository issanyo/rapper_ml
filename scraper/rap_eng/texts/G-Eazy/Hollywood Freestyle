[Verse 1]
You know what we came to do
Turned up on some roof with a crazy view
Off a couple of drugs I can name a few
Going till I got the spins like a Lazy Sue
This motherfucking life I lead
Crazy ass motherfucking life I lead
Roll up let me light this weed
Man this shit's moving fast but I like this speed
Now every day I'm faded, feeling like I made it
That's a lie, but every night a different bride gets naked
She just gives it up and then I take it
I really do this shit but you just fake it
Money coming in now let me rake it
I make a batch of brownies and then we bake it
And my mind is so gone, rolling up more tryna get in my zone
Fuck going out, man, I'm quite fine at home
'Bout to call an old ex cause I'm trying to bone
Yeah, always drunk on the daily
This lifestyle is crazy, I got bands like Katy
Rap until I turn eighty, Mac Dre albums raised me
This shit is so wavy
You can hate it's all gravy, you can hate it's all gravy
Okay, I'm always coming up with an absurd flow
I was signing hella boobs up at your show
Told her put it in her mouth and then jerk slow
She was pretty fucking smart as far as nerds go
Always paid like I serve blow, all I do, earn dough
My flows special like I learned slow
And I see your trying to win it's my turn though
