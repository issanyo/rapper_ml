[Intro: G-Eazy (Spoken)]
It's Tha Refill
Go get the album January 8th
Yah

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Back in the day, I used to jot away
Sittin' in the back of class, writin' rhymes all day
With my headphones up, it made sense to us
Cuttin' class, droppin' 85 cents to ride the bus
To go and hit the studio, go and drop a track
Young dudes spittin' hot, fell in love with rap
I dreamed of making it from reading in the magazines
XXL & The Source and it's all I read
Paintin' pictures through my lyrics 'bout the shit I've seen
Thinkin' in my mind "It ain't nobody sick as me"
But I guess I gotta prove it though
Grind hard and spend every chance I got in the studio
We had a mission, to get the world to listen
To this cold shit and go and get that recognition
To get heard, we would hunt for days
But it's just another story from my younger dayz

[Hook: The Pharcyde]
In my younger days, I used to sport a shag
In my younger, in my younger, in my younger days I used to (way back, way back)
In my younger days, I used to sport a shag (ha ha ha, yeah)
In my younger days, I used to sport a shag (hip-hop)
Now in my younger days, I used to sport a shag
In my younger, in my younger days I used to, days I used to
In my younger days I used to sport a shag
Now in my younger days, I used to sport a shag

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I live hip-hop, it breathes inside me
You listen to it live every time that I'm grinding
Looking for ya boy? In the lab where you find me
Jeans sag low 'cuz the keep knitted grimy
I spit hot so everybody'll remember this
Please, I'm too fresh at this
Realized nobody fuckin' with me, been on top ever since
From now on refer to me as "your excellence"
Slap Docz in the lab with the evidence
Servin' up Tha Refills in the medicine
Dumb deep, so we ain't the ones to speak against
Wanna beef? I send goons to your residence
Bang, bang; now you're just a remembrance
You ain't never gon' see me unless you make a wish
I mean, it's like a ant fighting with a elephant
You would get stepped on
Pay attention, I'm a beast

[Hook 2: The Pharcyde]
But when it was in session, I always had a question
But when it was in session, but when it was in session
I always had a question, I always had a question
Always, always had a question, I always had a question
But when it was in session, I always had a question
But when it was in session, but when it was in session
I always had a question, I always had a question
Always, always had a question, I always had a question

[Outro: The Pharcyde]
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
