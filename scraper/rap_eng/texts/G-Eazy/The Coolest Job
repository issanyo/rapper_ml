[Intro: G-Eazy]
On the roof tops of London
Puff, what a sight
Yeah, what I day I have ahead of me here
So much work to do
Gotta play a show, Gotta sign titties
Ah, what a day

[Hook: Devon Baldwin & Mathew iPimpin]
Chim chim-in-ey, chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim cher-oo!
I does what I likes and I like what I do
Chim chim-in-ey, chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim cher-ee!
I scream as an artist of highest degree

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
I clock in when they hand me the mic and I rage
I clock out and they hand me my check right off stage
Like okay
You say your life cool but you lie
We never have school nights, its always July
Break Swishers down daily
I pack then lick it
Hit up after parties and get paid to kick it
Go home with some girlies
See if they're with it
Don't lie, if you had a choice too, you would pick it
This job is the coolest thought that y'all knew this
So young and ambitious, stay hungry and foolish, word
R.I.P Steve, those words are the truest
I put see the whole world up on my to-do list

[Hook: Devon Baldwin & Mathew iPimpin]
Chim chim-in-ey, chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim cher-oo!
I does what I likes and I like what I do
Chim chim-in-ey, chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim cher-ee!
I scream as an artist of highest degree

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I'm in love with this life there's no stopping, no option
I'm so high, all 'lax, Mary Poppins was poppin
Fly city to city touch down and drop in
I'm selling like hotcakes, you fuckers are flopping
I smoke pot a whole lot
My buzz is so hot
I think I'm on my way but haters hope not
I don't care what you say, I'm killing shit today
Roll two jays and chill my elevens are cool grey
I'm Pujols on deck with bases loaded up
When I spaz I go in yes sir I'm dope as fuck
They slept on me forever then I woke them up
Let me get in my zone
Pandoras box just opened up, oh shit

[Hook: Devon Baldwin & Mathew iPimpin]
Chim chim-in-ey, chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim cher-oo!
I does what I likes and I like what I do
Chim chim-in-ey, chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim cher-ee!
I scream as an artist of highest degree
