[Chorus]
Said ooh, that’s a lot, lot
Yeah, look at them bands, that’s a lot, lot
Like ooh, we don’t stop, stop
Count it up, that’s a lot, lot (brrr)
Like, hey, that’s a lot
Yeah, cashing checks out the box like
Ooh, that’s a lot, lot
Count it up, that’s a lot, lot

[Verse 1]
Cake, cake, cake
I’m laughing the whole way to the bank
I just take, take, take
Sweeping up this cash, I need a rake
I’m the captain out here, pullin' rank (ugh, ugh)
Clap that ass, give it a spank (yeah, yeah)
Going ape, ape, ape (ugh)
Shit, play this, my face look like somethin' stank (ugh)
This shit is fish grease, I'm court side, can’t switch seats
Model chick weighs 95, I don’t know what this bitch eats
The homie hit it, I hit it too
The head’s great, the pussy cool
She fell in love off three fucks like goddamn, that’s pitiful

[Chorus]
Said ooh, that’s a lot, lot
Yeah, look at them bands, that’s a lot, lot
Like ooh, we don’t stop, stop
Count it up, that’s a lot, lot (brrr)
Like, hey, that’s a lot
Yeah, cashing checks out the box like
Ooh, that’s a lot, lot
Count it up, that’s a lot, lot

[Verse 2]
Cash, cash, cash
I just took her home, I’m about to smash, ayy
Stash, stash, stash
Them hoes you be with are hella trash, ayy
Facts, facts, facts
I’m at Barney’s fucking up these stacks, ayy
She got ass, ass, ass
When I hit it, she gon’ throw it back like
Ooh, she a thot
She just wanna have my babies, tryna plot
Ooh, just took a shot
Take another and another
That’s a lot, ayy, you know?

[Chorus]
Ooh, that’s a lot, lot
Yeah, look at them bands, that’s a lot, lot
Like, ooh, we don’t stop, stop
Count it up, that’s a lot, lot (brrr)
Like, hey, that’s a lot
Yeah, cashing checks out the box like
Ooh, that’s a lot, lot
Count it up, that’s a lot, lot

[Bridge]
Cashing checks, 'boutta flex
Tryna fuck, shoot a text
She said, “now?”, I said, “yes”
Pulled up, put that pussy right to rest
I am nothing like the rest, ayy
"Baby, I’m the best”, ayy
Always pass the test
What can I say?
I am grateful, I am blessed

[Chorus]
Said ooh, that’s a lot, lot
Yeah, look at them bands, that’s a lot, lot
Like ooh, we don’t stop, stop
Count it up, that’s a lot, lot (brrr)
Like, hey, that’s a lot
Yeah, cashing checks out the box like
Ooh, that’s a lot, lot
Count it up, that’s a lot, lot
