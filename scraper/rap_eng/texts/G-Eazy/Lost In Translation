[Verse 1]
On the flight to Japan where the culture is doper
IPad in my hand, watching flicks till it's over
Hopped right off the plane, got picked up by a chauffeur
Fell in love overseas, now I’m trying to elope her
Found the girl of my dreams, you still messing with 7s?
She unlaced my 11s and unbuttoned my denims
Pulled down my Naked and Famous, now I’m naked and famous
Off an assortment of drugs, last week was wasted in Vegas
Got a sound of my own and I’m taking it places
Man this joint is a banger, take it straight to the stations
Take it straight to the blogs, take it straight to your Moms
Special shout out to those kids who like to bake to my songs
Word

[Hook]
I was in a foreign nation overseas
Trying to keep up and then got Lost in Translation
And then got Lost in Translation
I was in a foreign nation overseas
Trying to keep up and then got Lost in Translation
And then got Lost in Translation

[Verse 2]
Okay see my interpretation of fame is
Flying different places where they know what my name is
In my humble opinion the realest in the game is
Yours fucking truly, man this life is a movie
I been going HAM
My ignorance is sophisticated
You listening just to hate it
You pussy, you pissed I made it
PONPONPON, call Christoph and Swiss to make it
On my way this time, so consider me vindicated
Ah, word to Kam, I am who I am
If we ever smoked together, then consider us fam
If you still ain't got it popping, tell me what is your plan?
People heard about G out from here to Japan
I'm saying

[Hook]
I was in a foreign nation overseas
Trying to keep up and then got Lost in Translation
And then got Lost in Translation
I was in a foreign nation overseas
Trying to keep up and then got Lost in Translation
And then got Lost in Translation
