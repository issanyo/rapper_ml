[Hook]
I feel no pain
Vengeance on my mind, all night, all day
I feel my rage
Once I get on and on, I'll say
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Yeah
Clear visions with my eyes closed
Where I wanna take this to is where my mind goes
The road less traveled is the high road
I been knocked down, but every time I rose
'Cause I can move a mountain with my bare hands
Just need a fair chance, I never let 'em down
I never settled down, I came to get the crown
Avoided shortcuts, all I did was have a better sound
See all I did to make it, was stay extremely patient
I never been complacent, I never did  get jaded
I lived inside my studio, the room was never vacant
I'm unparalleled, I'm sorry, we are not adjacent
It's just the way I am, just gotta make a plan
I think of what I want and get it, every day I am
Chasin' dreams but never sleep, see how awake I am?
How you gon' win if you never try to take a chance?

[Hook]
I feel no pain
Vengeance on my mind, all night, all day
I feel my rage
Once I get on and on, I'll say
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I feel no plan
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I feel no pain

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
The underdog, I emerge from the fog
Lookin' for revenge, I been workin' all Summer long
They know what I came for, now why would I change for it
If I ain't doin' it right, then what the critics singin' praise for?
This is what I trained for, what the people pay for
Music got realer, started channelin' my pain more
Greats are the only ones I ever try to aim for
Ready to convince all of you haters if you ain't sure
Make no mistake about it, there's nothin' fake about it
You say I'll be at the event, well then, it may get crowded
You think I'm ever givin' up? For Pete's sake, I doubt it
I'm in my element tonight and you can't take me out it
And I said, fuck a comfort zone and started breakin' out it
This music's keepin' me alive, I swear I ache without it
The place I'm from made me who I am, just think about it
Can never take it out of me, can only take me out it

[Hook]
I feel no pain
Vengeance on my mind, all night, all day
I feel my rage
Once I get on and on, I'll say
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I feel no plan
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I feel no pain
I feel no pain
Vengeance on my mind, all night, all day
I feel my rage
Once I get on and on, I'll say
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I feel no plan
(Ayy, you know)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I feel no pain

[Outro: G-Eazy]
Yeah
Can never take it out of me, can only take me out it
Yeah,  just think about it
Can never take it out of me, can only take me out it
