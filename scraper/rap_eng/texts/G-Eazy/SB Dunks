[Verse 1]
I'm looking super duper cool in my SB Dunks
Gotta swisher on my ear cause I only roll blunts
When goes to the club I dap the owner whats up
Then we skips through the line and its straight to the front
I holler at the DJ cause yes he is fam
All the chicks want a picture cause they fancy the man
It's still Slap Docs, now the camps in demand
Yo I run Hip-Hop, now the plans to expand
Yea, and I'm still going harder than y'all
Make beats for myself boy I murder them all
The steeper the climb then the harder the fall
But I ain't ever coming down y'all, fuck nah
G-Eazy's who the fly kids listen to
I drop dope shit cause I'm in the position to
Listen, tune in, examine what I'm dishing you
I love this life boy I swear it's unconditional

[Verse 2]
Another dose and you might me dead
And I'm a Nike Head
I wear chains that excite the feds
Not to be up on this balls, yo pause
But my favorite shoes are Nike's and my favorite rapper's Nas
Clean out your ear wax I'm kicking new flavors
I'm rocking the aqua-marine blue blazers
I always catch glances when I make moves
When the eyes of the stranger's fixated on the shoes
I do what I do and at times it can aggravate
A haters mind state, I create shit and demonstrate
I'm just a Hip-Hop and shoe popping fresh kid
Who happens to make cool music and thats it
I'm in my own lane so I ain't always understood
I do my own thing and thats why I'm hella good
I mean I'm good off the bullshit that you be on
Smoking on some Cali trees, burning until the doobie gone

[Hook]
I rock, I rock SB Dunks and my Reebok Pumps
I got some Spike Lee Jay's that I only wore once
I don't know about y'all but we do things
Got a nice ass swag and a mean shoe game

Yea, yea boy I really like them sneakers
Yea, boy I really like them sneakers
Yea, yea boy uhh
