[Chorus]
Your love comes once in every now
You and I known your love comes once in a lifetime
Your love comes once in a lifetime
Your love comes once in every now
You and I known your love comes once in a lifetime
Your love comes once in a lifetime

[Verse 1]
She was the neighborhood dream girl
Can look, but don't touch, they all wanna know us
If it ain't with me, then it can't be no one
When the groupies came to the show
When the money started to grow
You stayed down, don't play around
Look at this girl we made now
Been around the world and I came right back for your love
Forgive me for the days and nights I was cutting up
Wanted the motions in the ocean and emotions covered up
From flashing lights in the club to magazine covered up
Fly you to Miami and cop you floor seats
And you would always tell me your heart was for me
Way before the models ripped the runway
It was us, drop-tops, speeding down the runway

[Pre-Chorus]
So let’s go
I want you to know that you're special
I'll never compare you to no one
Baby, cause I know that your love comes
Once in a lifetime

[Chorus]
Your love comes once in every now
You and I known your love comes once in a lifetime
Your love comes once in a lifetime
Your love comes once in every now
You and I known your love comes once in a lifetime
Your love comes once in a lifetime

[Verse 2]
And she was prom queen, I'm just a new Jack
My city tatted on my back, she had my back, I knew that
But I started looking for more
When they started feeling the flow
Them girls trouble
Come more than a lifetime and time don't wait for no one
I'm out here like I throw ones and they dance for me
My man he warn me how my come-up might just cancel me
Now I gotta go fix that, get that, hit that
He flip that in that like I used to be big D-A-D-D-Y
I'm so special, she can't have another dude that woo her
I got my Bugatti, but that just pickup [?] her
That sears these years on lairs get weird
My fear is tears that smears and make-up
Don't ever make up, you better wake up

[Pre-Chorus]
So let’s go
I want you to know that you're special
I'll never compare you to no one
Baby, cause I know that your love comes
Once in a lifetime

[Chorus]
Your love comes once in every now
You and I known your love comes once in a lifetime
Your love comes once in a lifetime
Your love comes once in every now
You and I known your love comes once in a lifetime
Your love comes once in a lifetime

[Bridge]
I only got one life to live
And I wanna spend it with you
Love the money and the cars, but listen, baby
You are what I’ve been missing

[Outro]
Your love comes once in every now
You and I known your love comes once in a lifetime
Your love comes once in a lifetime
