[Hook: Riva]
Boy you did me wrong
And darling that’s a fact
No need to apologize I don’t want you back
You don’t need to talk back just clean up your act
It’s too little too late now cause I don’t want you back
Boy you did me wrong
And darling that’s a fact
No need to apologize I don’t want you back
You don’t need to talk back just clean up your act
It’s too little too late now cause I don’t want you back

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Look I know I did you wrong
But how you get the right
To pick the same fight over and over every night
And yea I know you’re right
I fucked up but despite
The fact that I've apologized
It seems you take delight
In indulging in your pain
This is insane, ma you’re killing me
I accept that I did it
I accept responsibility
So look if you sick of me, get rid of me
I’m not gonna beg you back and tell my tail to kiss your toes
Because a bitch ain't what I'm finna be
Go tell your friends that I’m a dog
And while you’re at it go tell them
About that guy that you was cheating with on Chadick
And how you couldn't help it
You said you were so attracted
You shadier than me I swear you got nerves causing static
But I’m still fuckin' witchu
And you can’t let me go
So it must be something special
Either that or we're special... in the head
Cause this is crazy
I swear we should be finished
But somehow I still love you, but I hate you
Fuck I quit it

Boy you did me wrong
And darling that’s a fact
No need to apologize I don’t want you back

No need to apologize I don’t want you back
You don’t need to talk back just clean up your act

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Look if you don’t want me back
Then what you doing still in front of me
Could it be you hung on me
Somehow you still sprung on me
Don’t front on me
Trying tell me you would never ever wanna fuck with me, again
Now that’s a lie
So why deny you still in love with me
This just so dumb to me
You can’t pick what its gonna be
Can’t decide if you would rather fuck or pull a gun on me
Now what you wanna do
I’m standing right in front of you
I’m fine calling it quits cause best believe I ain't as dumb as you
You want me to run to you, and try and beg forgiveness
What the fuck, kid you crazy?
You got some kind of sickness
This relationship is fucked
We ran out of our luck
At a point you got to know when to get out of dodge and duck, Oh
And it’s a wrap
It’s time to call this thing a wrap
Before I have a nervous breakdown cause I’m about to snap
It’s a wrap just like saran
Understand and that’s a fact
So fuck you and fuck this argument cause I don’t want you back
