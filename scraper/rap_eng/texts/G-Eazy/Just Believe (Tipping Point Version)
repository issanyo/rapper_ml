[Intro]
Ju-Ju-Ju-Ju-Just Believe
I brought you something close to me, (Ju-Ju-Ju-Ju Just Believe)
And left with something you-
Can see through you're here, (Just Believe)
You haunt my dreams
There's nothing to do but believe
Ju-ju-ju-ju Just Just, Ju-ju-ju-ju Just Believe
Just breathe

[Hook]
I breathe in to the neck, marijuana I love you
Blowing smoke out till I blow away the struggle
It all falls down the clouds rain down trouble
I'm walking through the puddles
Knee-deep in it, but the rain ain't finished
It keeps pouring down on you till you swimming in it
Keep looking up, I'm looking for a sign
I'm waiting on my time, let me know when it's mine

[Verse 1]
They say this world we live is what you make of it
And the only thing it gives is what you take from it
So that's the world like I'm raping it
They say I'm wrong for that but it depends the point of view at which you taking it
My message they always mistaken it I don't mind
Cause whether or not they understand me I'm gon' rhyme
They minds locked inside a box like they doing time
My mind's probably the most out of it you gon' find
Contrary to what the haters feel I'm gon' shine
I just believed in this shit and now I'm on mine
I just got dealt a hand and made the best out it
Taking weed to the dome to get the stress out it
I breathe it in, and the issues go away
But the problem is they ain't gone, they stay
That's why i touch the booth and music take me away
So every time I'm making music bruh I'm good, I'm straight
Im' saying

[Hook]
I breathe in to the neck, marijuana I love you
Blowing smoke out till I blow away the struggle
It all falls down the clouds rain down trouble
I'm walking through the puddles
Knee-deep in it, but the rain ain't finished
It keeps pouring down on you till you swimming in it
Keep looking up, I'm looking for a sign
I'm waiting on my time, let me know when it's mine

[Verse 2]
I feel exhausted from life tryna find a drive
And it don't help I'm stressed out from this 9 to 5
But I'm still tryna thrive
Looking for my way out really, cause I ain't tryna live with mama till I'm 35
I fully feel jaded I ain't made it
And despite a little love I think how many people hate it
But fuck it, it ain't for them to appreciate it
If I waited for everybody to love it, then I would die and never make it
I remember being faded in the club the first night we heard "Fresh" come on, we seen the DJ when he played it
There's nothing like it except that moment where I make it
But then I stop and think "how many almost made it?"
Maybe fame is overrated or, maybe I'll make it at last
See I'm just waiting on my break like cracked glass
Just tryna live before I go out dressed
As I breathe in marijuana and I blow out stress

[Hook]
I breathe in to the neck, marijuana I love you
Blowing smoke out till I blow away the struggle
It all falls down the clouds rain down trouble
I'm walking through the puddles
Knee-deep in it, but the rain ain't finished
It keeps pouring down on you till you swimming in it
Keep looking up, I'm looking for a sign
I'm waiting on my time, let me know when it's mine

[Outro]
Just believe
