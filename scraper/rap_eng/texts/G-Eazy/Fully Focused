[Intro: Jay Ant]
Yeah
Uh

[Bridge: Jay Ant]
I'm fully focused, fully focused
I got my mind on my money and my money on my mind
And you notice, and you notice
I can make a bitch disappear like
Hocus pocus, hocus pocus
And you notice, and you notice
Fully focused, fully focused
I got my mind on my money and my money on my mind

[Chorus: Jay Ant]
And you ride for me
And you know that I'm gon' ride for you
And you ride for me
We gon' ride, we gon' ride
And you ride for me
And you know that I'm gon' ride for you
And you ride for me
We gon' ride, we gon' ride, ride, ride, ride

[Post-Chorus: Jay Ant]
Now if you a real one then throw your hands up high (Put your hands up, put your hands up)
You other niggas fugazi, I see you
Don't try to play me (Don't try to play me, my nigga)
If you a real one then throw your hands up high
(Put your hands up, put your hands up)
You other niggas fugazi, I see you
Don't try to play me (Don't try to play me, my nigga)

[Bridge: Jay Ant]
I'm fully focused, fully focused
I got my mind on my money and my money on my mind
And you notice, and you notice
I can make a bitch disappear like
Hocus pocus, hocus pocus
And you notice, and you notice
Fully focused, fully focused
I got my mind on my money and my money on my mind

[Verse 1: Jay Ant]
Okay, it's nothing, it's really nothing
How I mob and you need me, you see the style and
You get your ride in vacant just go and take it
That's how I make it, I'm faded
I'm smoking sherbert mixed with the cookie
Loud got me on the cloud man look where it took me
I'm high, so high I'll probably give the lord a high five
Like, "hey, high five"
Take your props, pops
And I won't ever stop until I get that top spot

[Chorus: Jay Ant]
And you ride for me
And you know that I'm gon' ride for you
And you ride for me
We gon' ride, we gon' ride
And you ride for me
And you know that I'm gon' ride for you
And you ride for me
We gon' ride, we gon' ride, ride, ride, ride

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Receive love and ignore hate
So every day I only strive to be more great
For six months I just tour straight
I found out I'm more poppin' than you are out of your state
But I ain't trippin' off of your plate
My belly's full, bills paid, credit score straight
They're wearing leather but the difference is yours fake
I hate to break it to you, that's that shit I been on
Homie, you're late
Respect's needed so I show it and receive it
And love reciprocates love, truly I believe it
Come home like a king is how I'm greeted
Heartbreak Gerald when I'm chilling here with Jay Ant getting weeded, yeah
You feel comfortable when you know who you are inside
Stay solid so there ain't no need to go and hide
Just trying to pull up in that foreign ride
We're so Bay Area, you know that green and yellow, black and orange pride
Uh
Eazy

[Chorus: Jay Ant]
And you ride for me
And you know that I'm gon' ride for you
And you ride for me
We gon' ride, we gon' ride
And you ride for me
And you know that I'm gon' ride for you
And you ride for me
We gon' ride, we gon' ride, ride, ride, ride

[Post-Chorus: Jay Ant]
Now if you a real one then throw your hands up high
You other niggas fugazi, I see you
Don't try to play me (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
If you a real one then throw your hands up high
You other niggas fugazi, I see you
Don't try to play me (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
