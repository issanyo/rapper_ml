[Chorus: Blackbear]
I will remember you
She got her own crib with a twin bed
In West Hollywood, she Uptown
And she dance to her favorite song
And sing along when no one's around
I will remember you
I will remember you

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Yeah, back when the first time we met
I was thinkin' 'bout sex but you told me not yet
I meant no disrespect I was just being honest, my only regret was
Never letting you know how I felt or what was up
That was too much Maker's in my cup
I was faded, too fucked up
And you probably think I'm an asshole
Read your facial expression
But it's not everyday someone comes and leaves an impression
Typin' shit to say to you then deletin' it on my phone when I'm textin'
Cause I still be thinkin' about you like every day, no question
But, I ain't really tryin' to fly out
And I'm no good at phones
And my life is on the road
I'm with the crew of Rolling Stones, but don't trip

[Chorus: Blackbear]
'Cause I still remember you
She got her own crib with a twin bed
In West Hollywood, she Uptown
And she dance to her favorite song
And sing along when no one's around
I will remember you
I will remember you

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
See I know I've got this tendency to fall in love real quickly
But it's usually a phase I fall into in every city
That passes away instantly
When I leave it's over
I come to my senses when I'm sober
But I thought about you, no lie
When I left, you stayed on my brain
Then we finally got to fuck, and that shit was all the way insane
Now I know that you're havin' a thought
Picture us having a spot
But look at this baggage I got
My life is crazy, I travel a lot
But, when I dip out in the morning you can trust
I'll be thinkin' about you looking out the window of my bus

[Chorus: Blackbear]
'Cause I still remember you
She got her own crib with a twin bed
And West Hollywood, she Uptown
And she danced to her favorite song
And sing along when no one's around
I will remember you
I will never forget you
