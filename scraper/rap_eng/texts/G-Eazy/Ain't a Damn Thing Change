[Intro: Enisa]
Sha-ba-da-ba-di-ta
Ain't a damn thing change
Sha-ba-da-ba-di-ta
Ain't a damn thing change
Statik Selektah
Sha-ba-da-ba-di-ta
Ain't a damn thing change

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Statik I got you
Young Gerald
Living fast as a bullet straight out a gun barrel
And I won’t touch hater’s hands, you hella unsterile
My career trajectory is the up arrow
FedEx knocking, droppin' off platinum plaques
That's two in a row, I'm doing back-to-backs
My new show prices going to the max
I need half a mil', that's without adding tax
Look at me shining, pressure made a Diamond
This shit came together with perfect timing
I still feel normal, but this shit isn't common
The house was two million, and I'm still eating Ramen
I'm in the backyard like "What a view"
I never gave a fuck, this is nothing new
Fucking bitches, doing drugs, this is what I do
In the mirror told my self, "There's not another you"

[Chorus: Enisa]
Though the money so loud
And the stage sold out
Ain't a damn thing change
Now the birds come out
See them chirping 'round
Yeah they want a taste
See my day went well
Because I'm real like that
Won't forget the days
I was dreaming hard
Yeah, I was born a star
Ain't a damn thing change

[Post Chorus: Enisa & (Joey Bada$$)]
Sha-ba-da-ba-di-ta
Ain't a damn thing change
Sha-ba-da-ba-di-ta
Ain't a damn thing change
Sha-ba-da-ba-di-ta
Ain't a damn thing change
Sha-ba-da-ba-di-ta (Bad Mon!)
Ain't a damn thing change

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Hold up, uh
Young Jozif
Steady climbing up the ladder, tryna to keep focus
These bitches' asses getting fatter make me feel hopeless
They just want the Magnum open
I just want the magnum opus
Consequences of a gold standard rapper
Different chickens in the kitchen on the stove tryna trap us
Got a new crib, ain't even get to put my plaque up
By the time I get the gold one though, it's going Platinum
Now they got a million and one questions to ask you
Got the world singing this song, would you imagine?
Pull up on the scene in the latest ghetto fashion
'Cause I'm only into flashing up the lights, camera, action
And the only law that I know is the law of attraction
So when it comes to fashion I just simply attack 'em
With the words and the melody
Fuck what you telling me
Nothing really changed except I'm a millionaire celebrity (Wow!)

[Chorus: Enisa]
Though the money so loud
And the stage sold out
Ain't a damn thing change
Now the birds come out
See them chirping 'round
Yeah they want a taste
See my day went well
Because I'm real like that
Won't forget the days
I was dreaming hard
Yeah, I was born a star
Ain't a damn thing change

[Post Chorus: Enisa]
Sha-ba-da-ba-di-ta
Ain't a damn thing change
Sha-ba-da-ba-di-ta
Ain't a damn thing change
Sha-ba-da-ba-di-ta
Ain't a damn thing change
Sha-ba-da-ba-di-ta
Ain't a damn thing change
