[Intro: Cisco Adler]
Aloha (Whoa oh oh oh)
G-Eazy (Cisco and Don Carlos, yeah)

[Hook: Cisco Adler]
All my baby girls, all my crazy girls
All my classy ladies and my shady girls
Just wanna party and move their body
So DJ put on that shit that goes
Boom Boom Boom
All my wild girls, all my fly girls
All my beautiful but really don't try girls
Just wanna party and move their body
So DJ put on that shit that goes
Boom Boom Boom

[Verse 1: Cisco Adler]
Everywhere I go, the people want to know
Where the ladies go, where the ladies go
To dance all night, drink all night, party all night
It's going down
All around the world, the beautiful girls
Dance to the beat, dance to the beat
And the boys watch and flash their watches
Thinking that the girls like diamonds, but they like beats

[Hook]

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I'm trying to leave this party
Soon soon soon
Hop in my beamer that goes
Vroom vroom vroom
You're the baddest in the
Room room room
And I assume sume sume
That by the way we eyefucked
For the last hour and a half
You're down to leave this party
And get a room room room
And I promise, I don't do this on the regs
Though ain't worried about the next ho
The sky is where your legs go
I'm so into you
I wish there was ten of you
To see in every city
But for now shall we continue like

[Bridge]
All my baby girls, all my crazy girls
All my classy ladies and my shady girls

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Your friend is cool too
But I was hardly into her
Seen a lot of other girls
And you were hardly similar
Been all around the country
Lately I gotten so lucky
I'm from Cali to Kentucky
And the mountains up in truckee
Man I swear
Nothing can compare to California where the women are
Superior and fit model criteria
"I swear"

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Don Carlos]
It's just a world of girls
Woah, oh oh, eh eh, oh oh
Come on girl, come and rock with me
Hawaiian girl want to rock with me
Jamaican girl, or American girl
Canadian, England girl
Woah, woah
"Yeah"

[Hook: x2]
