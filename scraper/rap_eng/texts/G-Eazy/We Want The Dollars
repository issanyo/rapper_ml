[Intro]
G-Eazy presents Tha, Tha Refill

[Hook: G-Eazy]
We, we want the dollars (we want the dollars)
We want the dollars (the dollars)
The, the dollars, the greens
The dollars, the, the dollars
Dollars

[Spoken: G-Eazy]
It's Tha Refill, yes
The Slap Docz is back
Album coming soon
The Epidemic

[Hook: G-Eazy]
We want the dollars, don't want nothin' but the greens
Say, we want the dollars (we, we want the dollars)
We want the dollars, want the dollars, want the dollars
Nothin' but the greens (nothin', nothin' but the greens)
Say,we want the dollars, don't want nothin' but the greens
Say, we want the dollars (we, we want the dollars)
We want the dollars, want the dollars, want the dollars

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
I'm bout my bread, so yes I want the dollars
Somebody want problems, that's when I send hollows
Partying with models, blowing blunts, poppin' bottles
With a bad bitch, so I told that bitch "Swallow"
So fresh and clean like I'm fresh up out the shower
Now my money stackin' high like a tower
Ask what I'm about, no I ain't never been a coward
And when I spit, all of these beats get devoured
So send the flowers to the grave, 'cuz I'm killin' shit
Bump from the Bay to down south, they be feeling this
Laid the pipe once, now she's been callin' ever since
Now she goes down and she's givin' me intelligence
Tired of everybody saying that they best at this
Not to outweigh the peoples, but I need me some evidence
I ain't believing this, I need me some proof
So sick, when I spit I leave diseases in the booth

[Hook: G-Eazy]
We want the dollars, don't want nothin' but the greens
Say, we want the dollars (we, we want the dollars)
We want the dollars, want the dollars, want the dollars
Nothin' but the greens (nothin', nothin' but the greens)
Say,we want the dollars, don't want nothin' but the greens
Say, we want the dollars (we, we want the dollars)
We want the dollars, want the dollars, want the dollars

[Verse 2: Man-Man]
