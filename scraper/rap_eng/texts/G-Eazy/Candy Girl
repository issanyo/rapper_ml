[Hook: Greg Banks]
She's my woman
Sticky now
And laid in chocolate treats
I could never get enough of her
She has a hold on me
She's my candy girl
From head to toe she got it
My candy girl (sweet candy, sweet sweet candy)
She's my candy girl
No other one can top it
My candy girl
(she my bubble gum girl keep it poppin')

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Yeah, sweet candy
She got me thirsty
She my Skittles, Sweet Tarts, and my Hershey's
She my Now and Later's
Gusher's bursting
She got me hooked
Like yeah, she doin' something
She got her own ringtone when she texts me
And the brain is as good as the sex be
Yeah, and I get nasty if she lets me
Legs spread
She tastes good like Nestle
That's our Secret
But you keep it
She the one
The only girl I'm tryin' to be with
The one I sleep with
The one I'm layed up in the sheets with
The one I "lick lick" then we switch
And I'm her lollipop
She spend time in the candy shop
Till she hit the spot
Then she probably stop
Think I'm addicted to candy
I need proof
Cause for her
Yeah, I think I got a sweet tooth

[Hook: Greg Banks]
She's my candy girl
From head to toe she got it
My candy girl (sweet candy, sweet sweet candy)
She's my candy girl
No other one can top it
My candy girl
(she my bubble gum girl keep it poppin')

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
And we both fresh, yes
Me and her keep it rockin'
She my bubble gum girl keep it poppin'
If you can see the money she droppin'
A-O Beezy
So if I want somethin she coppin'
She my candy girl
My favorite in the world
When I'm around she throw me the pearl
She throw fits when I'm gone
Cause she hate to be alone
But she tell me this her favorite song
Highly intelligent when she give dome
I keep her close to my heart like a rib bone
Said I was gonna blow by my fifth song
Now I'm in the club
Bottles up until that fifth gone
Iced out
Now my wrist's glowin'
I'm on tour goin' away
She patiently waitin' like that fifth song
My candy girl
Yep, she all I need
And she give the candy to me
Every night is Halloween

[Hook: Greg Banks]
She's my candy girl
From head to toe she got it
My candy girl (sweet candy, sweet sweet candy)
She's my candy girl
No other one can top it
My candy girl
(she my bubble gum girl keep it poppin')

[Bridge: Greg Banks]
She's my woman
Sticky now
And laid in chocolate treats
I can never get enough of her
She has a hold on me
I'm addicted to the way she tastes
She's my candy girl, candy girl, my candy girl
She's my woman, she's my woman
Chocolate, chocolate treats
I can never get enough of her
She has a hold on me
