[Intro: G-Eazy]
Yeah
Young Gerald, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Dylon, Dylon with the boom pow
Every week now I switch to a new style
Two 12's in the back just blew out
Everything I do end up in the news now
Leave the club with a few now
Just some Hollywood girls and they do chow
I'm drunk, I'm drunk in the mood now
2 AM, what you wanna do now?
(What you wanna do now?)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Look baby, pass the Stella
Don't spill on me, that's Margiela
Got this Oakland game to tell her
Goddamn, she look familiar
Think we hooked up at Coachella
What's her name? Isabella? Isa- uhhh... forget it

[Pre-Chorus: G-Eazy]
That's like a week ago
But we both know how weekends go
Tryna function, got some places we could go
Lock jaw got me speakin slow like yeah
I'm blessed on blessed
I don't GAFOS
You tryna fuck?
Yes on yes on yes on yes

[Hook: G-Eazy]

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Ay girl, what it do do
If u got friends, cool bring a few through
No fun if the homies can't have none
R.I.P. Nate Dogg shit is too true
And you know what I'm down for
Round 2, Round 3 into Round 4
Mood switched when she knocked at the front door
Next up was the uproar, yeah

[Pre-Hook: G-Eazy]
Was like a week ago, but we both know how weekends go
Tryna tuck off got some places we could go
Swear she got the deepest throat like wow
She's blessed on blessed

Yes on yes on yes on yes!

[Hook: G-Eazy]

[Bridge]
Sheesh, what you sayin'? I don't understand
Goddamn, I'm out my mind, I popped another Xan
Sheesh, I swear this lock jaw got me stuttering
Goddamn, girl, you so fine, I'd fall in love again
Sheesh, gettin' faded is my favorite rush
Goddamn, you talkative, ain't gotta say too much
Be quiet, who got some grapes? I'm tryna roll some trees
Goddamn, uppers and downers, I'm off both of these
Gettin' faded, not complicated
Too sedated, no conversation
Gettin' faded, not complicated
We too sedated, no conversation
Please say less
Please say less
Please say less

[Pre-Hook: G-Eazy]
I'm blessed on blessed
I don't GAFOS
You tryna fuck?
Yes on yes on yes on yes

[Hook: G-Eazy]
