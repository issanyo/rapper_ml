[Intro]
Marty Grimes
KDE on the boards, I see you boy
This shit is just so Ignorant
So fuckin' Ignorant

[Verse 1: Marty Grimes]
VIP bottles all on my table
My niggas with me, we sippin' up
I got bad chicks and they able, these fools ain't hot or cool as us
Its stallions all in my stable, I'm screaming out "fuck a label"
Cause it's dollars all in my pocket
And I'm living life like I'm famous, you know
I stay high, yeah I'm racking up on my air miles
She raise it up, I'mma tear it down
Got the party poppin', I'm here now
Got Kev with me, Phil with me
Beaucoup bottles, takin' shots of Henny
Joint lit, I got Rasta in me
These dudes fake, they deserve an Emmy
Clique full of RNs that go in, no penetration
Young fly nigga what I'm demonstratin'
Don't cuff your chick she need ventilation, breathe
No suffocation on my side, I'm on cloud nine in a high rise
And that European how I ride, deceased

[Pre-Hook: Marty Grimes]
See me coolin' with my crew and no one new
To the point where we do anything we wanna do
We be deep to every party when we rollin' through
In that old school, thought you knew

[Hook: Marty Grimes]
Four 12's in the trunk gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know my clique gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know this beat gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know that we gon' bang, bang, bang
We gon' bang, bang, bang
Four 12's in the trunk gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know my clique gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know this beat gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know that we gon' bang, bang, bang
We gon' bang, bang, bang

[Verse 2: Marty Grimes]
Find me riding through your streets
My beat loud, my windows down
Chunkin' deuces up to my peeps, I'm getting money and they wonder how
Big faces I'm touching now to yo chick city I'm flying out
Fly me out and I put it down then we blow a pound before the second round
See, I'm the boss of this town
Young king of the city like "where is my crown?"
No joking around, if you're talking about money then I hear you out
Bitch I'm balling, Spalding, Mike Jordan
In my nudies, belt Louis and that two piece Ralph Lauren
Some call me cocky, shit I ain't tripping, that might be true
But check the whip while I'm sliding through
And I dropped the grip on these Nike shoes
I ain't even on but I'm signing boobs
She ain't know I rap, just think I'm cool
Cause I smoke trees, roll deep
Rage all night and get no sleep

[Pre-Hook: Marty Grimes]
See me coolin' with my crew and no one new
To the point where we do anything we wanna do
We be deep to every party when we rollin' through
In that old school, thought you knew

[Hook: Marty Grimes]
Four 12's in the trunk gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know my clique gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know this beat gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know that we gon' bang, bang, bang
We gon' bang, bang, bang
Four 12's in the trunk gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know my clique gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know this beat gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know that we gon' bang, bang, bang
We gon' bang, bang, bang

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Let's take 'em back, '06, four 12's just to make it slap
Beat knocks like we had gorillas in the back
Every day same shit just listening to Mac Dre
Go to the lab just to make a clap
If I don't fuck with y'all I don't shake or dap
Everytime I rap now I make a stack, and everytime you rap now I take a nap
Playboy from the Bay boy, ain't shit changed but the clothes fit now
Always sell out when my show's in town
Marty this beat go, your shit pound
He's heating up, he's on fire, his shit's hot, go hose it down
You're not on my level, bro sit down
I rep for the Bay and I holds it down, listen (shwoop)
It ain't no one new in my crew
Been down since tall tees when Marty would come through after school
Now this shit bang, this shit bang
Might get a gold tooth, just one fang
Rapper pulling hoes like he R&B sang
Come from the Bay, still speak that slang
Eazy

[Pre-Hook: Marty Grimes]
See me coolin' with my crew and no one new
To the point where we do anything we wanna do
We be deep to every party when we rollin' through
In that old school, thought you knew

[Hook: Marty Grimes]
Four 12's in the trunk gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know my clique gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know this beat gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know that we gon' bang, bang, bang
We gon' bang, bang, bang
Four 12's in the trunk gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know my clique gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know this beat gon' bang, bang, bang
Y'all already know that we gon' bang, bang, bang
We gon' bang, bang, bang
