[Intro: Ugochi]
Little bird
Little bird
Little bird
Little bird
Spread your wings
And fly away

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
I should have known, but this won't ever work here
Honestly realized it way back in our first year
I'm not even religious, but hope there's a church near
It's whiskey on my lips and it's been too much thirst here
My lifestyle is gettin' outta hand
I come down and take a Xan
Did too much blow tonight, I try to sleep, but I can't
Ignoring phone calls, when she hit me I don't answer
'Cause I'm faded, I ain't tryna listen to another lecture
These drugs are the only way I'm escapin' from the pressure
You don't know what it's like for me, you got no way to measure
She said "I know you well, why you don't let me in to help you?
These groupies at these parties, they don't even know the real you
I'm worried about you, hope you never do enough to kill you
Decide what you want, 'cause I can only wait until you-
Push me so far, then I've got nothing else to tell you
If I don't make you happy, hope success and all the wealth do

[Chorus: Ugochi]
Little bird, little bird, little bird, little bird
Spread your wings
And fly away
Little bird, little bird, little bird
Won't you spread your wings
And fly away?

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
The toughest part is letting go
Million times you saw the cliff, but never jumped to end it though
Mistakes can always turn into another lesson though
Say I'm selfish, but you're telling me what I already know
If you were smart you would run away and never let me know-
Where you went, so I can't chase you there; fly away and go
Don't ask about me, you'll be happier the less you know
Nothing'll change if we keep staying put like we're in control
But you just don't budge, you just like an old judge
Can't you see we got stains on this? This is no smudge
If only we could live with no liquor, no drugs
You got every right to hate me, but you still hold no grudge
You gotta go, even though it hurts, is this for certain?
Even though I'd hate to see you with another person
And even though you'll always be there in my heart just lurkin'
Haunting me, I gotta find myself and now I'm searchin'

[Chorus: Ugochi]
Little bird, little bird, little bird, little bird
Spread your wings
And fly away
Little bird, little bird, little bird
Won't you spread your wings
And fly away?

[Bridge: G-Eazy]
I wish you happiness, one day you'll find the right one
You're a queen, you deserve to be treated like one
Vacation for the mind every time I go to light one
Karma is a bitch, I'm well aware one day it might come
Yeah, one day it might come
(Fuck....yeah)

[Chorus: Ugochi]
Little bird, little bird, little bird, little bird
Spread your wings
And fly away
Little bird, little bird, little bird
Won't you spread your wings
And fly away?
