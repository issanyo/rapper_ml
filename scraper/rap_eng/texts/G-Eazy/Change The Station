[Intro]
Change the station

[Hook]
You ain't talking what I'm tryna hear, nah
Fam I ain't tryna hear your information, stop it
Just a bunch of bullshit clogging up my ears
Man pass the remote change the station
And you ain't talking what I'm tryna hear, nah
Fam I ain't tryna hear your information, stop it
Just a bunch of bullshit clogging up my ears
Man pass the remote change the station

[Verse 1]
See lately there's been a lot of shit talking going on
Cats start getting mad once you're going strong
Try coming up with something that you're doing wrong
Instead of giving props dapping me and moving on
Tell me what the fuck is going on really
If I switch it up and spit some real shit then you don't feel me?
Rather hear me rap about ice I don't have?
Shopping on Sax Fifth Ave, hands full of bags
Nah but I will hit some boutiques
Cause I chill with some sneaker head shoe freaks
I'm straight to the bank when I gets paid
Spend my whole check in a day
Go and smoke a blunt in the PM then it's time to
Hit Mc D's drive through
A fix for the munchies, they taking too long I'm impatient
Wish I could pick up a remote change the station

[Hook]
You ain't talking what I'm tryna hear, nah
Fam I ain't tryna hear your information, stop it
Just a bunch of bullshit clogging up my ears
Man pass the remote change the station
And you ain't talking what I'm tryna hear, nah
Fam I ain't tryna hear your information, stop it
Just a bunch of bullshit clogging up my ears
Man pass the remote change the station

[Verse 2]
Yo trust it, they hate me I love it
But people start to think I'm married again cause my attitude is fuck it
Turn my system up intentionally making ruckus
They hating on me now but when I'm big they'll love us
Until then, I'm not rich yet
But I'm stealing hoes, stealing shows
Killing each set that they give me
No lie I rock crowds strongly
No matter if half the crowd still sleeping on me
Blowing purp got me lazy like a zombie
Looking like I need to wash my laundry grungy
But I could give a fuck less watch me reach success
The record biz sucks but i guess it sucks less
Than being unemployed, my girlfriend's annoyed
Cause I'm smoking all day higher than an asteroid
She wanna argue but I'm too impatient
Wishing I could pick up a remote change the station

[Hook]
You ain't talking what I'm tryna hear, nah
Fam I ain't tryna hear your information, stop it
Just a bunch of bullshit clogging up my ears
Man pass the remote change the station
And you ain't talking what I'm tryna hear, nah
Fam I ain't tryna hear your information, stop it
Just a bunch of bullshit clogging up my ears
Man pass the remote change the station
