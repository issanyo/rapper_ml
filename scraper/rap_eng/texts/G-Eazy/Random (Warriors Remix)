[Hook]
This is the anthem
Told the world we need everything and some, yeah
Defenses can't stand him
Hit a three, whole arena starts chanting
Got it all with the world wide champions, yeah
These wins are not random
Every team ain't got it understand son
Yeah, this ring is not random
Woah okay

[Verse 1]
It's our league and we do what we like to (like to)
No team is ready when we slide through
If you forgot we got it I'll remind you
Cause we got what they got I'm talkin' times two
Disagree with me and you've been lied to
I am nothing like you, and no I'm not the type to
Follow bullshit y'all give the hype to
I can see the fakes, so when I look in your direction
Understand I'm seeing right through
You're hollow, you follow
Everybody's not the real McCoy
Worldwide, yeah, they feel the boys
California out to Georgia, Florida then up to Illinois
When I watch these other teams I just feel annoyed
Haters, I don't understand them
Steph Curry with the shot, yeah and one (OG)
The world knows you can ask them
Back to back to the finals were advancing

[Hook]
This is the anthem
Told the world we need everything and some, yeah
Defenses can't stand him
Hit a three, whole arena starts chanting
Got it all with the world wide champions, yeah
These wins are not random
Every team ain't got it understand son
Yeah, this ring is not random

[Verse 2]
Now imagine it, put the hours in and stayed passionate
If a man's open Curry's passing it
Figured what the hell you wanna do in life and practiced it
Pay attention, none of this is happening by accident
Listen, we don't slack a bit
Game plan's solid, no cracks in it
Said we want another ring, nothing less is adequate
Next season back in it
I was born addicted to the winnin'
Difference is now I finally found a way to manage it
What you think we want for nothing?
You must be mistaken someone
Well we had to go take that from 'em
We're tryna be great at something
Time to go this evening, flying from the Bay to Cleveland
This shit isn't fair, we ain't playing even, nah
Try and doubt us, I'm like iight guess
Why yes, started undefeated, why test?
Best in the whole league, why stress?
Understand show some respect when you fly west

[Hook]
This is the anthem
Told the world we need everything and some, yeah
Defenses can't stand him
Hit a three, whole arena starts chanting
Got it all with the world wide champions, yeah
These wins are not random
Every team ain't got it understand son
Yeah, this ring is not random
