[Intro: G-Eazy]
Young Gerald, Jeremih, uh

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Yeah, my whole life I've been written off
Like a sick kid who's spitting cough
Now it's all changed I blew up, I'm lifting off
The whole time I just been cut from different cloth
This is Cashmere, is that clear?
Catching paper cuts from the paper I've counted the past year
A monster, a beast, except I'm nastier
Swift you need a favor? Then put your cash here
From the wood works now they all call
But I'm in a different league, they're playing small ball
I ball through the summer, the winter and all fall
So if they never saw it coming, I'm telling them all, nah

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
Creatures like us, can't be alone
Creatures like us, we freak

[Hook: Jeremih (& G-Eazy)]
Something's got you up all night
So tell me who you're gonna call
I bet you never saw it coming
I bet you never saw it coming
Someone's gotta make it right
Now tell me who you're gonna call
I bet you never saw it coming
I bet you never saw it coming
(Never saw it coming)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, count on me to get the job done
Said I want a rollie so I copped one
Never had a plan B, they told me I should probably adopt one
Nah I'll keep living this way till it's all done
Only one option, always been the underdog
Dog keeps climbing up till he is the top one
So who gon stop me?
What's an atheist to God's son?
I don't know, shoot, what's a ghost to a shotgun?

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih (& G-Eazy)]
Creatures like us, can't be alone
Creatures like us, we freak (you know)

[Hook: Jeremih (& G-Eazy)]
Something's got you up all night
So tell me who you're gonna call (yeah)
I bet you never saw it coming
I bet you never saw it coming
Someone's gotta make it right
Now tell me who you're gonna call
I bet you never saw it coming
(I bet you never saw it coming)
I bet you never saw it coming, aye

[Bridge: G-Eazy]
You know, it's like they never saw it coming
I said, I'm a beast, I'm a creature
Charging down payments on a house for a feature

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih (& G-Eazy)]
Creatures like us, can't be alone (Yeah, yeah)
Creatures like us can't be, can't be alone (Uh huh)
Yeah

[Hook: Jeremih (& G-Eazy)]
Something's got you up all night
So tell me who you're gonna call
I bet you never saw it coming
(Yeah, ain't never saw it coming, uh)
I bet you never saw it coming
Someone's gotta make it right
Now tell me who you're gonna call
I bet you never saw it coming
(Never saw it coming)
I bet you never saw it coming
Something's got you up all night
So tell me who you're gonna call
I bet you never saw it coming
I bet you never saw it coming
(Never saw it coming)
Someone's gotta make it right
Now  tell me who you're gonna call
I bet you never saw it coming
(I bet you never saw it coming)
I bet you never saw it coming

[Outro: G-Eazy]
Uh, Eazy
