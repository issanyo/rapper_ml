[Chorus: Chet Baker & G-Eazy]
I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
I fall in love so easily (yeah, haha)
I fall in love too fast (uh)

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Yeah, uh
I take a sip, another sip, repeat
Continue on until I'm finished with this whiskey neat
I write a hitlist, take 'em down until the list complete
I get obsessed with every single gorgeous chick I meet (yeah, uh)
My liquor is the color brown
Nothin' in my life is ever watered down
See my reflection when I'm sober and it comin' down
Realize I'm hot and cold, my mood is always up and down
That's the life of a star, shout out my baby 'cause she gets us
I met her last week, we fell in love, now that's my precious
Dinners up in Catch, it's pretty models in my presence
We do the same thing
Like every week 'cause that's the essence of the lifestyle (uh)
I want it, want it right now
I'm staring 'cross the room, she got a nice smile (yeah)
I'ma fall in love with her as soon as we press lips
And when it's done, I'm thinking 'bout my next fix
My addiction, uh

[Chorus: Chet Baker & G-Eazy]
Still, I fall in love so easily (so easily, uh)
I fall in love too fast (too fast)
I fall in love so easily (you know, uh)
I fall in love too fast (fast, yeah)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Uh, I swear I fall in love so easily
Conversations at the bar, we sippin', now she teasin' me
Time to leave the party
Have valet bring them keys to me, the 'Rari pull up
I'm not even trippin', what she sees in me?
It's beneficial mutually, she's getting what she needs from me
Wildin' at the red light, like, "Come on, have some decency"
You don't even understand the beast that you unleashed in me
Pullin' up your dress
I'm going crazier with each degree of nakedness
Yeah, we both know where we takin' this
There's no turning back now, it's too late for this
You never met no one like me, might be the craziest
Once I get you to my, room it's over, then I'm slayin' this (yeah)
It's pretty simple, not a lot to it
I just don't know how to not do it
I can't resist, sometimes the dramas so much
Don't know how to walk through it (you know?)
My addiction, uh

[Chorus: Chet Baker & G-Eazy]
Still, I fall in love so easily (so easily, uh)
I fall in love too fast (too fast)
I fall in love so easily (you know, so easily, haha)
I fall in love too fast (yeah, fast)

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Uh, yeah, I swear my life's a constant contradiction
My love's a gateway drug, move on to my next addiction
Regress tomorrow, but right now feel like the best decision
The up and downs of living with this love and sex addiction
A high like this is way too much, can never last too long
When coming down, can't tell what I be fallin' faster from
My love, if I jumped the balcony
I mean the crash would come the same
I hate the slower lane, I choose the faster one
The beautiful and damned, the destiny is so tragic
Its hard here for a pimp, or a hopeless romantic
I'm cut from this cloth, I'm sewn from this fabric
Could run it through the wash two times
But come out full of static
Could try to lay low, I never been no good at it
Cold turkey for a week, but then I'm back at it
I need what I need, I'm livin' like a crack addict
Or not, when I get my fix I'm feeling ecstatic
My addiction

[Chorus: Chet Baker & G-Eazy]
Still, I fall in love so easily (so easily, ha, so easily)
I fall in love too fast (so fast, yeah)
I fall in love so easily (you know, uh)
I fall in love too fast
