[Verse 1]
Yeah, Unmesswithable
Black on black Vader, soundtrack is so cynical
It’s for certain, keep a cup of Bourbon it’s so critical
I’m just getting started, still a couple years from pinnacle
Lowkey I been killing y’all in another interval
You kiss that girl, you imbecile, her mouth stay on my genitals
Text me ten times I never hit her back, pitiful
I hate how this industry is soooo political
You should just sit down with all that bull go and get a stool
I just don’t believe you, don't know who you think that stuff would fool
Yeah, legendary status what I must achieve
She came thru to smash right afterwards I made her up and leave
You don’t even know what I got up my sleeve
Told my team, “We’d make it in a second, trust me, just believe"
Yeah, rap game James Dean, been here
I’m just out here doing stuff they ain’t seen
Yeah

[Verse 2]
And don't I look good on the TV screen!
Hey mama, I know I act a fool but now I'm on the show I used to watch after school
Yeah, except difference is nowadays I’m making like triple times your dividends
Walk my stage like Johnny Cash, hello to a massive crowd
Quiet but I’m passing loud, solid crew - no rats allowed
Everybody know I’m next to win, you could ask around
Classic shit, that’s the sound, labels tryna track me down
Faked it ‘til I made it, everything’s official now
Don’t fit in, I stand apart from everybody, that’s just how
Everything I do, I put my name on as original
Skeet on a rich girl’s boobs and watch it trickle down
I want in on every dime bag or nickel now
Every rapper that I’m about to pass up's in a pickle now
Eazy
