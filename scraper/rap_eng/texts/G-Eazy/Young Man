[Intro]

[Verse 1: Anthony Stewart]

Pushing my freedom to its limits
There's infinite hours in this day
Burning the sack until it's finished
I guess I got plenty of time to waste
Or maybe it's that I've miscalculated
I highly doubt that that is the case
I've been told many times not to rush these things
That's why I stay at this pace
And he said

[Hook: Anthony Stewart]

You may be right, but you do not know it all
Young man your head is big, but your mind is small

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]

With a random girl on top of me
Life is moving too fast to think about monogamy
Or to sit and think about it logically
Just a young George satisfying curiosity
My head's large, but that's only cause I'm paid, and I'm in charge
Got it figured out as far as I can see
The dichotomy between young and old
My mistakes will probably catch up with me down the road, but for now

[Guitar solo]

[Hook]

[Bridge: Anthony Stewart]

Is this education adequate preparation
For what they call the real world?
Or is my dedication misplaced concentration
A necklace void of all its pearls?

[Hook x2]
