Now they see me coming up, is when they all get jelly
Karate kid, my sensei is Fonzerelli
That's forty, I come from the land of the hyphy
My club is all pros like the brand of a white tee
Only a million dollars in my hand will excite me
And I tour across the atlas then I plan to go sight see
I never talk back when you're trying to diss us
Cause my response when we know you're lying is crickets
If I ain't poppin please explain who's buying the tickets?
And my deal's not a deal it's like they're buying a business, yeah

[Hook: G-Eazy]
You could be anything in this world
You could be anything in this world
Momma said, you could be anything in this world
You could be anything in this world
But of all things in this life you could pick to be
You sure look like a hater or a bitch to me
Of all things you could pick to be
You sure look like a bitch to me



[Verse 2: Too $hort]
They call me short but I started at the top
North Cal bitch if you like it or not
It is what it is, it's an Oakland thing
What you doing short?
I'm just smoking man
I got her thinking I'm the man to be
Fuck with me, this ain't no fantasy
We them real Bay Boys, all we do is make noise
We ain't never been quiet come through and take hoes
I hope he don't get mad cause she want me
I really don't want her I just want to get money
You can see me, cupcake give a fuck what you think
She's a rich girl, and I'm in love with her bank
You wanna be like her? wanna car like that?
Wanna be my work? I'll be your mentor baby
I make you a motherfucker
You take all this money and that other sucker, bitch

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
I leave the club with a bad one, head right to my spot
Put some Ty Dolla on and put pipe in the thot
Got a style the world likes it a lot
I get on tracks spit, sneeze, cough, and throw up
I'm not wiping the snot
On my way if you like it or not
I'm looking at the top I'm just eyeing the spot
And I just keep climbing I been hiking a lot
If you told me these things would all happen
You'd be right on the spot
Yeah, cause ever since I was able to grow fame
My superpower's I can swoop your girl with no game
Straight to the point with no shame
Spot her at the party I'm a long distance sniper with pro-aim
If you're a bitch then respect you won't gain
Most of these cats are so lame
Rapper fell off turned into a no name
Lost it all and now you're trying
To grow your buzz back like Rogaine
It won't
