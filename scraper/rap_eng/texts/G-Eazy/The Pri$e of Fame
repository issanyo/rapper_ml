It's all about the come up. You know so much of hip-hop is a story of from nothing to something.

I've never owned a car in my life, I don't know when I would drive it. I've never owned a house, I don't know what I would do with it. I'd never be in it. People see celebrity as mansion, car, white teeth, and fancy clothes. You know but what they don't see is severe anxiety and fear of falling, cause there's no safety net under me.

There was no plan B there was no trust fund or anything like that. It was like "this has to work." Like have endless nights back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back killing yourself in the studio. Like the misery the pain. Does this mean anything? Is this trash? Like no one cares. You do not have an audience, no one cares about what you're making, it's all in your head. And I was just like determined, like it had to happen.

That's the thing about music is it's not like a 9 to 5 when you're done you go home. You have to run with it, you have to work your ass off and kill yourself to get any kind of results. I kill myself in the studio because I want to be great. You know, and I want to make something that matters to people. You have to project out into the universe what you want out of the world. You know, what do you want to be the best at? It didn't happen overnight, you know, so it's tough to look back and say like, "well when did it happen?" you know. "When did your whole life change?" I don't know, gradually over the last 5 years. So it's like, if I do want to have a house one day, if I do ever want to enjoy driving a car one day, it's not just gonna just fall in my lap, or maybe I don't know.
