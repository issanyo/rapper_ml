[Verse 1]
Lights
Camera
Strike a pose
And have someone help you, put lipstick on
Yeah, high heels now you're six feet tall
And everybody knows who you are

[Refrain 1]
And nobody cares if your heart is aching
Nobody cares if you wanted  more
Nobody wants to know
Cried the night before

[Pre-Chorus]
Investing your dreams and your hopes
Into it
Everything you used to know
Is gone
And you're slipping into
In your role
Trying not to lose yourself

[Chorus]
Cause these lights won't kill me now
Saying these clothes won't change me now
Saying these words won't scare me now
Saying I will be myself
I will be myself

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Got signed and my life changed
People acting like I've changed
It's still the same old Gerald
With a bus pass I don't drive range
Guess I keep it just to say I do
I haven't been home in like a month or two
I mean to tell the truth I ain't have a day to even buy a car if I wanted to
Yea I got money now but everything changed in just a blink
Like I don't even know what to think
For like ten years I could touch the brink
I mean it's tough to last there's evidence
I mean I'm not trying to be a pessimist
I mean I'm just trying to make sense of this
I mean I don't know I guess it's just
People saying I should keep in touch
But truth be told I ain't sleeping much
It's so non stop it's so much pressure
There's plenty times I need a rush
Fuck am I saying I love this shit I'm supposed to be here
This is my dream I focus see clear
It's all your choice if you chose to see fear

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus x 2]

[Refrain 2]
Nobody cares if you're heart is aching
Nobody cares if you want no more
Nobody wants to know
Nobody cares at all

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I want to be myself
(Who?)
I want to be myself
(Who?)
I want to be myself
(Who? Who...? Who?)
