[Intro: Qui単]
'Cause I do
'Cause I do
'Cause I do
Keep writing you

[Verse 1: Qui単]
Heart is racing hard
Got you on my mind
Don't ever think I don't
I know what you like
And I'm the only one that ever should
Know when I cross your mind
Make you wanna hit it right
Right now, but don't even think about it
I could get you right, yeah
And I'm the only one that ever could
But what you should do

[Chorus: Qui単]
Don't, don't, don't
Don't think I don't think about you, oh, oh
'Cause I do, but
Don't, don't, don't
'Cause I do, cause I do, but
Don't, don't, don't
'Cause I do, but, oh

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Last night I sent a message
Drunk when I sent it, pieces of a fragmented sentence
Essentially along the lines of saying I'm in town
And crossed the line, just saying if you're down
Let's chill and get a drink
I sipped, hopin' I would hear again
The text bubble popped up and disappeared again
Like I don't want it gettin' weird again
And I don't wanna fight
And I don't want you shedding tears again
It's not a big deal, but don't think I don't think about you
Just 'cause I ain't spoken about you
I'd asked how you feel, but already know I won't get it out you
You'll probably tell your friends that I wrote this about you
Whatever, I know I can be jealous and crazy
The voices in my head have liked to yell at me lately
I still can't believe what they've been telling me lately
Sometimes I wonder if you share my sentiments, maybe
Let me know

[Chorus: Qui単]
Don't, don't, don't
Don't think I don't think about you, oh, oh
'Cause I do but
Don't, don't, don't
'Cause I do, 'cause I do, but
Don't, don't, don't
'Cause I do, but
Don't, don't, don't
Don't think I don't think about you, oh, oh
