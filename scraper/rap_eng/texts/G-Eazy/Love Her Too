[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If I love her and I love you
Could you love her too?
Walking away from her
I'm afraid to do (Yeah)
The moment I choose one bae
One piece of my heart gon' lose (Yeah)
If I love her and I love you
Could you love her too?

[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
I'll be on my clich√©, tryna find a three-way
Grew up on rappers from the East Bay (Bay)
Can't pull myself all this leeway (Yeah)
I pay for both, ain't no cheap day, no
My good intentions ain't no wiser
Made me walk it through fire
But I would be a lie

[Pre-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If I, if I, if I

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If I love her and I love you
Could you love her too? (Yeah, yeah)
Walking away from her
I'm afraid to do (Could you love her too?)
The moment I choose one bae
One piece of my heart gon' lose (I will lose)
If I love her and I love you
Could you love her too?

[Post-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy & G-Eazy]
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Marc E, I got you
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I'm a Romeo, feel like '95 Leo
In love with you both, let's have a trio
Take a trip to Rio, we can keep it on the D-low
They ain't gonna know where we go
Know you got somebody but
Really what does he know?
Baby pretty, black and Filipino
That's a hunch, and I keep it a C-note
Life is all a gamble
It feel like a casino out in Reno
But I tell the truth to her, if I feel a way then she know
Anything, anything
I do it for my sweetie-pie
She know I will die
Before I ever share a piece of my heart
But this time I had to ask to let the thrill fly
Man, this shit gets so bad, that's why I need to try
Is she down, or is it only gon' be she and I?
Normally my girl will tell you
Really I'm the sweetest guy
But this might really set it off, I can't even lie

[Pre-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If I, if I, if I

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy & G-Eazy]
If I love her and I love you
Could you love her too? (Ayy)
Walking away from her (No question, yeah)
I'm afraid to do
The moment I choose one bae
One piece of my heart gon' lose (Yeah, uh)
If I love her and I love you
Could you love her too? Yeah (I'm just playin', but I'm sayin')

[Post-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy & G-Eazy]
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, ooh-la-la (I'm just playin', but I'm sayin')
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la (Yeah)
Could you love her too?
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
(Like I love her too, yeah, if I love her too)
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
(Like I love her too, yeah)
