[Intro]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah

[Chorus]
What are you yellin' for?
You’re screaming out your lungs all day and night
I can’t control a girl like you
She need a Saturday away from home to drink more champagne
I can’t mold a girl like you
In all designer to remind her
You can’t buy her, just her clothes, no
Can’t define her, can’t design her
In the 90210

[Hook]
Yeah
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
What are you yellin' for?
You’re screaming out your lungs all day and night
I can’t control a girl like you
She need a Saturday away from home to drink more champagne
I can’t mold a girl like you
In all designer to remind her
You can’t buy her, just her clothes, no
Can’t define her, can’t design her
In the 90210

[Hook]
The 90210
The 90210
Yeah

[Bridge]
Reverb on guitar plucks
Cigarettes and Starbucks
And her line of credit's high
High as the line gets her that her credit card cuts
So in love with the scene
So in love with being seen
Probably it’s time to intervene
But she doesn’t care, so she keep the party goin' in the meantime
Till it's all over, she can’t rewind
If she gets her fix then she’s fine
I should probably hit her with the peace sign
Falling for it each time, yeah
Oh yeah

[Outro]
I can’t find her, I can’t find her
In the 90210
The 90210

I can’t find her, I can’t find her
In the 90210
The 90210
