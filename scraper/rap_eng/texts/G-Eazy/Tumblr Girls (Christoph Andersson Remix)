She said she can't feel her face, right now I can't feel my heart
For your feelings there's no place, but you knew that from the start
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
Meant to die, we moved fast and then we crashed
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last

Never knew her name, they're looking all the same to me
They only chase the fame, there's no one left to blame but me
Never knew her name, they're looking all the same to me
They only chase the fame, there's no one left to blame but me

She said she can't feel her face, right now I can't feel my heart
For your feelings there's no place, but you knew that from the start
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
Meant to die, we moved fast and then we crashed
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last

Never knew her name, they're looking all the same to me
They only chase the fame, there's no one left to blame but me
Missing everything you say, it's not important what you stand for
You're asking will he be the one, I'll be gone before you're done tonight
Waiting for another day, you're not getting what you paid for
Trying to salvage what's undone and deny you got outrun tonight

She said she can't feel her face, right now I can't feel my heart
For your feelings there's no place
But you knew that from the start
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
Meant to die, we moved fast and then we crashed
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
