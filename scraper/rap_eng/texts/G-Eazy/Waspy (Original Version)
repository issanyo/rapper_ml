[Hook: Tennis]
Coconut Grove is a very small cove
Separated from the sea by a shifting shoal
We didn't realize that we had arrived at high tide, high tide
Will we make it out alive?

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
I got this new girl, she love to spend money
See anything I need, she go and get it for me
She's my sugar-momma, so I call her honey
She only wants to party, and get her nose runny
This shit is cool, but I don't know if she's good for me
We always eatin' out, and she don't cook for me
But why complain? I'm reclined
Chillin' on a plane on a first-class flight that she booked for me
She says "I think I love you", I said I love her back
We hit the sneaker shop, and she gon' drop a stack
And if she buys dinner, I'll buy us both a sack
She loves the way I hit it, she request it from the back
I'm a punk kid, and she's a rich girl
She's from the other side of town and that's a different world
But what she don't know is how to live a real life
She's a waspy girl, we party all night

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
We ride around in her daddy's new Benz
She always lets me drive every time I hop in
I got where I wanna go and swoop up friends
She's livin' in a fantasy, she hope it never ends
'Cause we're superficial as it gets and that's all it is
Her booty ain't that fat, but her wallet is
Cocaine diet, that shit is obvious
This bitch is overly aware of how high she is
It's always Belvedere bottles when we pop shots
Vacations in the water on her Pop's yacht
[?] on my feet, I'm on a boat fool
My Raybands on, pimpin' like I'm s'posed to
Yeah I'm a punk kid, and she's a rich girl
She's from the other side of town and that's a different world
But what she don't know is how to live a real life
She's a waspy girl, we party all night

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
If real life hit her, she wouldn't know what it was
She only love sex, money, and drugs
If real life hit her, she wouldn't know what it was
She only love sex, money, and drugs
She only love sex, money, and drugs
She only love sex, money, and drugs
She only love sex, money, and drugs
