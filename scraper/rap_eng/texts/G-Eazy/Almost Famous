[Chorus]
Young with too much cash, watch how I came up fast
They say I'm next to get it
They bring your name up last
And while I made it splash, rappers came and passed
But still I ask myself
How long does famous last? (Yeah, don't worry about it tonight)
How long does famous last? (Blow all this cash, I might)
How long does famous last?
How long does famous last?
How long does famous last?

[Verse 1]
I'm addicted to this lifestyle
Never going back to no basic shit
When we on tour every night's wild
Thinking about the days we weren't making shit
Spending everything just to make it back
Saying everything never take it back
So if you don't fuck with me I'm okay with that
I'm okay with that (okay with that)
In a black shirt and some faded jeans
Been around the world in these APC's
Working non stop trying to take the keys
Off the lot next week spending 80 g's
Intro my floor to your lady's knees
Always on tour cause I'm making cheese
Michigan in February is 8 degrees
And the fans waiting outside could maybe freeze
Yeah, smoking on killa
Never going on unless your team is strong
Yeah, finally making skrilla
Everywhere I go bring my team along

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, now I'm almost famous
Still right here with the oldest faces
Swear I came up from the coldest places
Young man gets everything, he goes and chases
Aw man

[Chorus]
Young with too much cash, watch how I came up fast
They say I'm next to get it
They bring your name up last
And while I made it splash, rappers came and passed
But still I ask myself
How long does famous last? (Yeah, don't worry about it tonight)
How long does famous last? (Blow all this cash, I might)
How long does famous last?
How long does famous last?
How long does famous last?

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to marry Kate Upton
Blow this money too quickly
To them squares who trying to hate: fuck them
You can't catch me, I move too swiftly
I'm always going through customs
When I leave I'm knowing you miss me
We run through bottles like nothin'
Like I'm tryna drown in this whiskey
Indulge in everything we wish
We drink it straight with no mixers
Got bitch drinks if you squeamish
At the after parties, no pictures
My bag of trees looks greenish
Got a bad bitch to roll swishers
This lifestyle's the sweetest
Man I'm shining now just like fixtures
Yeah, do it for my city
Everywhere I go bro, I rep the Bay
Yeah, tell you it's a pity
But hating fucks always got shit to say uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I'm almost famous
Still right here with the oldest faces
Swear I came up from the coldest places
Young man gets everything, he goes and chases
Aw man

[Chorus]
Young with too much cash, watch how I came up fast
They say I'm next to get it
They bring your name up last
And while I made it splash, rappers came and passed
But still I ask myself
How long does famous last? (Yeah, don't worry about it tonight)
How long does famous last? (Blow all this cash, I might)
How long does famous last?
How long does famous last?
How long does famous last?

[Outro]
How long does famous last?
How long does famous last?
How long does famous last?
How long does famous last?
How long does famous last?
How long does famous last?
