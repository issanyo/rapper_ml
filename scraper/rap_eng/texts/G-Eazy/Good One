[Hook]
If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special, way above normal
And let her get away yo than this here's for ya
If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special, way above normal
And let her get away yo than this here's for ya

[Verse 1]
Yo I first met her, at first didn't stress it
I guessed it
Probably wouldn't last, like the last few I messed with
It's bad when it breaks and you've got time invested
And shattered pieces of you're heart is what you're left with
It's why I touched no cuffs
But after five months
No lie yo she had me arrested
And so my conscious suggested
I slow down
Play a different role now
Give it a chance cause you never know
Weather it'll ever grow
And if she's special well man you better let her know
Before you let her go
Think twice cause stress comes after the N like the letter O
Wished I would've kept you
So I'm bitter in the rook
Wish'n that I woulda took a different approach
If I had a second chance I promise to try hard
When I reminisce over you my God

[Hook]
If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special, way above normal
And let her get away yo than this here's for ya
If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special, way above normal
And let her get away yo than this here's for ya

[Verse 2]
Friend told me, brody its a cold ass world
And our environment is full of cold ass girls
And they scandalous as us
As soon as one damages your trust
Never love em, just chase them till you bust
If the game gets played
And trust is betrayed
Than I'm heartless, so long I ain't the one to get played
First, but each time is worse than the previous
Them girls now a days do be devious
However by nature I'm naive
And perhaps believe
In the right circumstance true love can be conceived
But you does how I felt, but fell victim to doubt
I guess in the end I lost out
Cause without you I feel like, half of me is missin
I can't stop trippin
Cause I got us both into this position
But for a second chance I promise to try hard
When I reminisce over you my God

[Hook]
If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special, way above normal
And let her get away yo than this here's for ya
If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special, way above normal
And let her get away yo than this here's for ya
