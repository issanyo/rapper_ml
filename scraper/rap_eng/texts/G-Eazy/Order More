[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
We do this almost every night could never quit
I just did some molly for the hell of it
I'm hyphy and I'm drunk, I'm doin' hella shit
After I drain my pockets, I replenish it (I do)
She said she's a good girl she don't do this much she celibate
So just be careful and be delicate
Then I fuck her so damn good, swear I invented it
I told you if I said it than I meant this shit (I do)
After we hit the club we hit the titty bar
This duffle bag that's full of ones will get me far
You don't know how lit we are
Since a boy I've been a star
She's ready to go it's time to get the car, yeah

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I'm popping champagne, now I'm pouring more
I just ran out of ones it's time to order more
So if you want this cash you gotta show some more
That private dance is through that corridor (let's go)
I'm off drugs and a bunch of shots
After party at my cribbo with a  bunch of thots
So order more bottles don't care what the cost
My neighbor is a bitch they tried to call the cops (you bitch)
Fuck you I'm living life, all good don't need advice
Pussy is my favorite vice, I see you I get enticed
Them titties nice, tonight I'ma hit it twice
Coming home on that Bay Bridge
Two AM on them city nights, yeah
(Let's go)

[Hook: Starrah]
Oooh, fuck around and order more, money

Gon' throw it back, cause I got racks on the menu
You ain't even gotta ask shawty, cash on the menu
The way you drop and shake it fast, need that ass on a menu
Yeah baby, make it clap cause we got cash on the menu
