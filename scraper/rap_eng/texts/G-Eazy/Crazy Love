[Hook]
What’s it all about
This crazy love
How did our two worlds entwine
Crazy love, love, love, love, love

[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah 9 months on the road like that’s a long tour
With no time to spend money, so what’s it all for
And I’ll fuck up a check on Moms, but past that
Ask myself what I grind for
I want more like damn that work ethic is so impressive
I’m feeding the fam and the whole collective
But ain’t took a day off because I’m so obsessive
Like when did free time get so expensive
5 years straight without a leave of absence
Whiskey and work, I’m trying to keep a balance
And crash into anybody who’s seen his talents
First hand but my hands are tied...

[Hook]
What’s it all about
This crazy love
How did our two worlds entwine
Crazy love, love, love, love, love
