[Intro]
Uh, Eazy
You want another one?
Whooo
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, whooo)

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
Now I'm back up on that bullshit
Still ridin’ through the city wit' a full clip
Still wit' the same niggas that I grew up wit’
Tryna build a family, need somebody I can do it wit'
Every real nigga need a down bitch
Every real nigga need a down bitch
Every real nigga need a down bitch
Every real nigga need a down bitch
She gon' up the Glock for me that's my down bitch
She gon' send them shots for me that's my down bitch
Every real nigga need a down bitch
Every real nigga need a down bitch

[Verse 1: Yhung T.O.]
Uh, hold it down for me, yeah, yeah
Load up these rounds for me, yeah, yeah
Anytime I call on you, you'll be right there
That's why I gotta keep you close
Anything that you want you can have it
I can’t go a day without my bad bitch
You the realest that I know, you ain’t average
That's why I gotta keep you close

[Pre-Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
If you ever need to smile, I’m who you call on
You will never see a bitch up in my call log
And yo' last nigga lame, he was all talk
Long as I got you by my side I never fall off

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
Now I'm back up on that bullshit
Still ridin' through the city wit’ a full clip
Still wit' the same niggas that I grew up wit'
Tryna build a family, need somebody I can do it wit'
Every real nigga need a down bitch
Every real nigga need a down bitch
Every real nigga need a down bitch
Every real nigga need a down bitch
She gon' up the Glock for me that's my down bitch
She gon' send them shots for me that's my down bitch
Every real nigga need a down bitch (you know)
Every real nigga need a down bitch

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Uh, It's hard to know who to call
When you got nothin' and your back's on the wall
Similar confusion when you really get it all
Most of 'em get lost in it all
Hard to know who to trust when you shot right past 'em
Life gets different when you're seven times platinum
Rollie on my wrist same color as a magnum
And they go crazy when you rip open a magnum
She was screamin' in my face, "Go to hell"
Got caught wit' somebody shoulda knew she would tell
Fuck, she stuck around I put her through hell
To fix it, it cost me three bands at Chanel
Gets what she wants, when she wants 'cause she stayed down
One day might push a swing at the playground
Yeah, been wit' me through the bullshit
Tryna build a family need somebody I can do it wit'
Uh

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
Now I'm back up on that bullshit
Still ridin' through the city wit' a full clip
Still wit' the same niggas that I grew up wit'
Tryna build a family, need somebody I can do it wit'
Every real nigga need a down bitch
Every real nigga need a down bitch
Every real nigga need a down bitch
Every real nigga need a down bitch
She gon' up the Glock for me that's my down bitch
She gon' send them shots for me that's my down bitch
Every real nigga need a down bitch
Every real nigga need a down bitch

[Outro: Yhung T.O.]
Need a down, down, need a down bitch
That's my down bitch, that's my down bitch
Need a down, down, need a down bitch
That's my down bitch, that's my down bitch
