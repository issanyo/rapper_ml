[Intro: G-Eazy]
You know if I say something I mean it
These things happen
Yeah

[Hook: Remo]
If I ever said I'm never scared
Just know I mean it
If I ever said I fucked your bitch
Just know I mean it
And if I ever said I'm gettin' money
Just know I mean it
And oh Lord oh Lord knows
He knows I mean it
Yeah, you know I mean it
You know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Signed Gerald, I'm sincere
This year I'm in here, I'll spell it out to make things clear
Meanwhile your end's near, I've got a lane and I'm in gear
You people wonder who's next up
That conversation really ends here
You rappers just talk a bunch, stress me out, I chop a dutch
Weak rappers tryna bite the sound, but my style is a lot to munch
And I'm more like whiskey neat, and you're more like vodka punch
"Gâ€™s dope, he might blow up," think I know, I've got a hunch
On my side it's authentic, you try to stunt but it's all rented
But you're dope you got a bad chick, yeah, cool bro we all get it
She wears a ring, came through without it
You really think she stay true? I doubt it
Cause I'm fucking your girlfriend, and there's nothing you can do about it

[Hook: Remo]
If I ever said I'm never scared
Just know I mean it
If I ever said I fucked your bitch
Just know I mean it
And if I ever said I'm gettin' money
Just know I mean it
And oh Lord oh Lord knows
He knows I mean it
Yeah, you know I mean it
You know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Just know I mean it
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah

[Verse 2: Biz]
Overdose on my confidence
Head is swole from these compliments
Never needed a hand out, y'all can keep your conidments
Your girl thinks that i'm dominant
The price of your incompetence
She got stockholm syndrome, but at least she's still an optimist

Been tryna get money cause nothing is free
You been spreading rumours, but talk is cheap
I'm a big dude, need a big bank, and a bitch who is a freak
Who goes down for me

But fuck it, they say you are what you eat
That makes me pussy then pussy is sweet
Running this game yet they try to compete
And they get anxious when they hear me on beat

If the beat is dirty Better know i clean it
If the clothes are fresh better know i pree it
If you're talking Bizness Better know i be it
If you're talking about this song, better know i mean it
