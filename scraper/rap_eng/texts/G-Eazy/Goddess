[Intro: MOD SUN]
I wanna run away with you
She a Goddess
I wanna run away with you

[Verse 1: MOD SUN]
She a Goddess, she a Goddess
I'm just being honest
Run away with me swear I got us
You the finest, deserve the finest
They'll never find us on an island
We'll be smiling, we'll be shining
We'll be styling on them every summer
Make up for every bummer
Ill treat you like you're un-discovered
Never find a better lover
That's a promise
Time is upon us
So skip the commas
Straight up I just wanna

[Hook: MOD SUN](x2)
I wanna run away with you
We can run away
We can run away
We can run away

[Verse: 2 G-Eazy]
And as bad as she is
She can't be basic or at least I can't imagine she is
She's a Godess I swear
Other women only see the way I'm living, there's no honesty there
Had some issues in the past working hard to repair
Visions of vacations forever I wanna be there
Leave it all of what's left at home
Least if you come I'll be less alone

[Hook: MOD SUN]

[Bridge: MOD SUN]
She a Goddess, she a Goddess
I'm just being honest
She a Goddess, she a Goddess, she a Goddess
I'm just being honest
Run away with me I swear I got us

[Verse 3: MOD SUN]
And I know you scared
But I'll always be there
Got no time to prepare
We can go anywhere
Yeah my style is so rare
Not careful, full of care
Got enough I can share
We can go anywhere
She know I got a reputation
She know about my situation

[Hook: MOD SUN]
