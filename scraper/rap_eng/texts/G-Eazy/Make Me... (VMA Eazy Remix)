[Verse 1: Britney]
Friday, I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody
This feeling, I wanna go with it, cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Britney]
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (oh yeah!)

[Chorus: Britney]
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Post-Chorus: Britney]
Baby, cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star
Out in Vegas or little bars
Really not a difference if it's near or far
Listen, here we are, need you
I've always wondered what was off limits
Staring at you til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this was all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we could tell that there's changes coming
See I could tell that you're a dangerous woman
That means you're speaking my language, come on
Now follow me, let's go
Like Penelope in "Blow"
Well worth the stealing you, it's a felony, yeah I know
That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah
But I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
To give you something sensational, so let's go, yeah
Said I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
So follow me and I can make you

[Bridge: Britney]
Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
Cause I got me for life
Oh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul
I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keeping me alive
I don't need anything to make me satisfied
Cause the music does me good and it gets me every time

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
And as far as I can see I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me get a world that they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
Cause this hunger is driving me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speaking on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends, we don't take L's we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends
I'm right back to work when that break ends

[Chorus: Britney]
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Post-Chorus: Britney]
Baby, cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
(Yeah, you make me oooh...)
