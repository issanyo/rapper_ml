[Verse 1: Olivia O'Brien]
You don't make time like you used to
Got a new girl, new friends, brand new
I swear it's like I don't even know you
Yeah, I miss the old you
I kinda want to fight like we used to
To make it alright like we used to
Anything, 'cause I didn't want to lose you
But this time we've gone too far
We've gone too far

[Pre-Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
This new you, this new dude
Don't know him, don't want to
I wish that I still knew the old him, the old you

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
R-I-P to the old you
I miss the old you
It's like you're dead to me now
R-I-P to the old you
I fucking miss you
I would have never let you down like you did to me
Now you're dead to me
R-I-P

[Verse 2: Drew Love]
Some lies are made to be told
Promises are made to be broke
Baby, our story ain't made to be told
You be better off on your own
Go ahead, get it off of your chest
Got feelings that you didn't want to catch
Still here, but it feels like you left
No space, maybe that's for the best
Really should trust you but I can't
I know it seems like I hate you, but I don't
I never should've loved you but I do
Could never figure out what I want
I know it makes is kind of hard to tell the truth
And I know, I know I said that we should pump the brakes
But I don't wanna ever be replaced
And you can barely look me in my face
And both of us is too afraid to say it
But I don't think we'll ever be the same

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
R-I-P to the old you
I miss the old you
It's like you're dead to me now
R-I-P to the old you
I fucking miss you
I would have never let you down like you did to me
Now you're dead to me
R-I-P

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Let's put it to rest now
Before we make a big mess now
And you know that I been a mess
Gettin faded to alleviate stress now (yeah)
There's some things I'm not proud of
Livin' with my demons in a crowd of---
People who ain't never know about love
But a fresh start, that's what we're out of

[Chorus]
R-I-P to the old you (R-I-P to you)
I miss the old you (I miss you)
It's like you're dead to me now (dead to me)
R-I-P to the old you (R-I-P)
I fucking miss you (I miss you)
I would have never let you down (never let you down)
Like you did to me (like you did to me)
Now you're dead to me (dead to me now)
R-I-P
R-I-P to the old you (R-I-P)
I fucking miss you (I miss you)
It's like you're six feet in the ground
