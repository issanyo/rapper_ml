[Chorus: G-Eazy]
Yeah, gimme, gimme, gimme money (yeah)
Spendin', spendin', spendin' money (yeah)
People say they want my spot? (Yeah)
But you'll never get it from me (yeah)
Yeah, gimme, gimme, gimme money (yeah)
Spendin', spendin', spendin' money (yeah)
People say they want my spot? (Yeah)
But you'll never get it from me (yeah)

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Squad is deep, my team strong
This right here is my theme song
Go and get it when I need somethin'
Always knew I was gonna be someone
Got myself, I don't need no one
I'm pourin' up with some weed blowin'
'Cause up's the only way we goin'
These hoes turn up to hear me flowin'
And I don't plan on ever stoppin' (nope)
It get lonely at the top (yeah)
Yeah, the air is rare up there (you know)
You know, these haters pray that I flop (yeah)
Yeah, I'm on point like an ice pick
On lock like a vice grip
And your girl is on my tip
You'll never see the day that I slip

[Chorus: G-Eazy]
Yeah, gimme, gimme, gimme money (yeah)
Spendin', spendin', spendin' money (yeah)
People say they want my spot? (Yeah)
But you'll never get it from me (yeah)
Yeah, gimme, gimme, gimme money (yeah)
Spendin', spendin', spendin' money (yeah)
People say they want my spot? (Yeah)
But you'll never get it from me (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Uh, gloomy goblin with the green hair
This too easy, it don't seem fair
Kush got me on a bean chair
She top me good, she must be square
Movin' slow but I'm livin' fast
This shit happened to me in a flash
Brown bags, yeah, I'm gettin' cash
Put half of it up in a stash
They say they down, they be switchin' fast
That shit fake, it don't get a pass
Put the pussy up in a cast
Mortal Kombat, I finish that
Seen the world in my A's hat
Drinkin' straight, I don't chase that
It's time you haters all face that
Nef the Pharaoh said, "Say that"

[Chorus: G-Eazy]
Yeah, gimme, gimme, gimme money (yeah)
Spendin', spendin', spendin' money (yeah)
People say they want my spot? (Yeah)
But you'll never get it from me (yeah)
Yeah, gimme, gimme, gimme money (yeah)
Spendin', spendin', spendin' money (yeah)
People say they want my spot? (Yeah)
But you'll never get it from me (yeah)
Yeah, gimme, gimme, gimme money (yeah)
Spendin', spendin', spendin' money (yeah)
People say they want my spot? (Yeah)
But you'll never get it from me (yeah)
Yeah, gimme, gimme, gimme money (yeah)
Spendin', spendin', spendin' money (yeah)
People say they want my spot? (Yeah)
But you'll never get it from me (yeah)
