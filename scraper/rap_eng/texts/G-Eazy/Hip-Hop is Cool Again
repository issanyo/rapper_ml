Ey yo son, waddup?
You heard hip-hop is cool again?
Ey yo true story

Ey yo son, I'm fresh

You wanna bandwagon now that hip-hop is cool again
Ey yo waddup my dude
You heard hip-hop is cool again?

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Ey yo, it's funny how they thought that I was square
When they all have Lil Jon and I have Tribe in my ear
They used to laugh and say: "what you listening to them for?"
I'm bangin' Illmatic CD player on track four
I said it's hip-hop and they started to laugh more
Said how many years I've been listening to rap for
You mean to tell me you ain't heard Illmatic
You ain't heard about Tribe or the Digable Planets
They say: "yeah that's that old shit tho
Yeah it used to be aiight but it had no mode"
Who would have thought a few years down the line
They would hop in timemachines and go right back in time
Back to the golden age when hip-hop was alive
Now they tryna act like they all jive
You can go and try
But the truth is can't even fly
You be done when the wagon moves by
Bye bye

[Verse 2: Charlie Dimes]
It feels so good, to see another summer
I missed you New York, you know Charlie loves ya
I feel a cool breeze, smokin' mad tree
[?]
While I was hella blunted, I brought this shawty home
"Charlie I love your music, you had that shit from the start"
I beg you pardon mommy, but I been the god
I split the world and settle things and tell you who you are
When they call me brocks, well you can call me boogie
[?] hip-hop will walk with me
I think I heard of you, wait I know I have
They used to rock with cool Homer Simpson dad
[?] peace, respect
To my cool for the afro [?]
I was rapping I was on deck
My money poppin', I was throwing black parties and it wasn't for the check
We talking see, 11 12 73
Music given a name, I start ski
[?] the fantastic [?] three
[?] the busy bee
[?] the ceiling light was so beneficial
Cause music is more than just rhyme
I'm tryna define [?]
