[Verse 1]
Now how you measurin'
Talent or who's better than
Shit, I made it here with the team on my back no letterman
Tour like I'm a veteran
Cali to the Netherlands
But he's an average joe, they say he'll never win
White rapper with a cheesy name
Thinkin' he might find easy fame (false)
Haters please refrain
Look at all these fans you've seen me gain
Real recognizes real
Maybe that's why you can't see it
Put your readin' glasses on
High up and I'm passin' strong
I engineer my sessions
I can probably teach you lessons
There's so much more than meets the eye upon your first impressions
See, I work hard but don't we all
I rip shows? but don't we all or do we
Rappers say a lot but boy I, boy I really ball
Traded in my social life for pro tools and a mac
Staying in of Friday night's laying vocals on my tracks
Swear in never use to party, I was focused on the plaque
Thought I fade away and quit, you fools I told you I'd be back
I be in the lab like dexter and your as fake as polyester
Through it all I stuck with school, bout to start my last semester
So, can't tell me what it is to grind
Did my thang and I took my time
Class of my own boy I'm so stoned
Im high as Diddy's credit line
Why would I stand where I don't fit in
Why would I rap if I ain't shitin'
Why would chick keep lookin' at me
When its clear to see that she came with him
Shoot for the starts and I aim to win
Smokin' good and drinkin' gin
Girls get loose, poor a lil juice
Party all night till it hit AM
Yeah, yeah, I'm on my way
Why would I trip off what they say
Hit the stage for 30 minutes get off and get twice their pay
Damn and that some real shit you should think about it
If you took the time to listen instead of doubtin' you'd be bout it
See, regardless of what they speak
They can talk ill turn my cheek
Givin' up and walkin' home and calling it a day is super weak
I keep going I'm runnin' on E
Rapcast really got nothin' on me
Check this out what you don't see
For a minute I've been killin' this shit low-key
Labels try to fly me out
Buy me sushi sit me down
But I don't fit in with the mainstream
So that's why I mean we can't be down
Sorry fools but I refuse to simply compromise my sound
Ill be up on me indy shit
You see my bro ill be around
Give my music all away
And then I tour away for what I got in store
I'm a young entrepreneur
See every time I worry
Or feel a bit unsure
I hit the stage and look around and feel so reassured
