[Intro]
Uh, yeah
I just told myself, uh
Yeah, uh, yeah

[Chorus]
Welcome to LA
The land of opportunity where everybody stay
The girls are pretty, the sun will shine 360 days
But I don't always feel that way, today I need some gray
Yeah, uh, please protect my soul before they weather it away
The land of opportunity where everybody stay

[Verse 1]
Yeah
They move out to this town with dreams, ambitions, and get lost in the party
Takes a toll on you, man, this shit will charge a large fee
Just don't forget who you are, G
Staring at the man in the mirror, like I recognize him hardly
Burn my sins away and twist some parsley
Stop and chill, these days I do it sparsely
In another universe I coulda' had a stroller and a car seat, word
They tell me things will happen how they supposed to
But somehow it seems I hurt all the people I get close to
Experiencing breakdowns at 27 goes through
'Cause you don't want to see heaven yet, where Janis Joplin knows you
On phone calls with Mama like she tryin' to give me a earful
She said "This is the town that happens in so just be careful
Been tryin' to keep your head straight
And dead-off all that bullshit, that's just dead weight"
Yeah

[Chorus]
Welcome to LA
The land of opportunity where everybody stay
The girls are pretty, the sun will shine 360 days
But I don't always feel that way, today I need some gray
Yeah, uh, please protect my soul before they weather it away
The land of opportunity where everybody stay

[Verse 2]
The whole world's outside knocking at my door like "Gerald, where the fuck that album at?"
But I ain't home, I'm on the road, the stage is where they found me at
So my personal interests take a backseat to the business
But I balance like a gymnast, like Simone in the Olympics
So please pardon my tardiness, I'm tryin' to put my heart in this
Give this shit my everything, every time when I start with this
Hungry for the world, thatâ€™s why I starve for this
Yeah, artists come and go these days it's easy, they're not hard to miss
Here today, gone tomorrow, they fade into a dark abyss
Hollywood sold you a dream, like how the fuck you fall for this?
Have to know yourself or you just really gon' get lost in this, sauce
I really paid the cost to be a boss
I paid in cash and skipped the tax, ain't asked for no receipt
When I get stressed I play the beat and split a Swisher Sweet
Damn, yeah, uh

[Chorus]
Welcome to LA
The land of opportunity where everybody stay
The girls are pretty, the sun will shine 360 days
But I don't always feel that way, today I need some gray
Yeah, uh, please protect my soul before they weather it away
The land of opportunity, yeah, uh
