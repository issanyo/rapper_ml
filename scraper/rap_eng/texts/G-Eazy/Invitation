[Verse 1]
You evoke the feeling
This feeling I've been dreaming of
I'm ready to reveal it
Let inhibitions come undone

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes or no, but no maybes
Not gonna beg, so don't make me
Yes or no, but no maybes

[Chorus]
Here's my invitation, baby
Hope it sets us free
To know each other better
Put your love all over me
Here's my invitation, baby
Come feel my energy
Give emotions to each other
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over

[Verse 2]
I know it might seem crazy
But I'ma put you in this blindfold
I just need you to trust me
Oh, that you see more with your eyes closed

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes or no, but no maybes
Not gonna beg, so don't make me
Yes or no, but no maybes

[Chorus]
Here's my invitation, baby
Hope it sets us free
To know each other better
Put your love all over me
Here's my invitation, baby
Come feel my energy
Give emotions to each other
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over

[Bridge]
Feel it now
Feeling something, kinda thinking out loud
Feeling something, kinda thinking right now, right now
But we could be right, right now
Right now

[Chorus]
Here's my invitation, baby
Hope it sets us free
To know each other better
Put your love all over me
Here's my invitation, baby
Come feel my energy
Give emotions to each other
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over
