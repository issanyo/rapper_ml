[Intro]
It's how it is
Sorry to bust your bubble
Look

[Verse 1]
I don't give a fuck if nobody ain't feeling me this time
Cause this is real talk when I'm depicting this rhyme
It's me being honest when I'm feeling it this time
It ain't that I'm hating all rappers it's just I'm
Tired of the way of the game
So much better being honest we all lie and hide away all the pain
If a rapper say he balling the truth of it is
Probably broke off last time cause the booth isn't his
They make it seem like it's a lucrative biz
When in fact, only ten kats a year make enough for their kids
To go to college cause we lack knowledge and know how
And I'm just trying to say how it go down
It ain't all crazy in the life that's lime
Getting paid eight hunnid for a show when they ain't seeing a dime
But fans to my song they love it
They don't know I'm flat broke cause I still ain't recruit my budget

[Hook]
I ain't tripping off of riches
I just hope that I make it
I'm tired of being broke
I just hope that I make it
Man when I was growing up I used to
Hope that I make it
And now I'm coming up and I know I'm about to make it
I ain't tripping off of riches
I just hope that I make it
I'm tired of being broke
I just hope that I make it
Man when I was growing up I used to
Hope that I make it
And now I'm coming up and I know I'm about to make it

[Verse 2]
Hell yeah it feels good when fans scream and they feel me on stage
But when I'm not behind the mic I'm making minimum wage
Contracts with this label got me locked in the cage
But I still know I'm doper though than any my age
And haters want to talk, I don't even let it get to me
Cause I be on their mind so much I guess they enemy
Kinda on some homo shit, I guess they envy me
Cause I'm doing me instead of something I pretend to be
Maybe cause their girlfriend's friending me
But on that note, I've been between more legs than a centipede
We might lie about the money we have
But get it clear we never lie about the girls we bagged
They throw it at me, I don't even have to try no more
Ever since I came up I guess they think I'm a star
But look, all this hating man this shit's uncalled for
Just trying to live a life that I worked so hard for

[Hook]
I ain't tripping off of riches
I just hope that I make it
I'm tired of being broke
I just hope that I make it
Man when I was growing up I used to
Hope that I make it
And now I'm coming up and I know I'm about to make it
I ain't tripping off of riches
I just hope that I make it
I'm tired of being broke
I just hope that I make it
Man when I was growing up I used to
Hope that I make it
And now I'm coming up and I know I'm about to make it
