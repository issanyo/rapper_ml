[Verse 1: Rexx Life Raj]
Still bounce out high for y'all niggas before I began
Back on my fuck everybody again
'Cause they don't give you your credit when your credit is due
But the hate come with it that's inevitable
I'm very reputable
Big, black, dread-headed and professional
Still barely accessible, I'm tucked off
Y'all been sleeping on me and tucked in
On my way to the gold, The Adventures of Huck Finn
You fuck niggas won't rain on my rein
I'm the nigga with the leverage, I'll cut the supply chain
My ambitions are as big as my frame
Changing lives with shit from my brain
That's telepathy
Give a lil' game but the sauce sold separately
Very old recipe
Never gotta lie when the truth is your specialty
One hunnid and I put that on everything

[Hook: Rexx Life Raj]
All my life I told myself I'd be this
Now I'm here I know they hate to see this
But it's too late to throw your shade
It's too late to sing your hate
You won't rain on my parade
Because I'm forever lit
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, I'm forever lit
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, I'm forever lit

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I'm forever lit, you never lit
Every day I'm dripping sauce, eggs benedict
I only lift a finger if I benefit
I need profit, I need helluva it
My footprint bigger than an elephant
To walk in my shoes, you like a clown
You walk with the weight of an ant, don't hear a sound
And we don't see you, that's 'cause we don't be looking down
And I'm the rarest civilian they ever found, look
I knew it all since Willard
A father figure sonning y'all watch you all get Ben Stillered
But this is not, no movie
I fucked already don't you try to tell me now you not no groupie
I do the job, then I bill collect
I knew Raj in '05 and it's still respect
I saw the dots and I told myself it will connect
I knew I'd be here looking back, now retrospect, forever

[Hook: Rexx Life Raj & (G-Eazy)]
All my life I told myself I'd be this (You know, I used to tell myself)
Now I'm here I know they hate to see this (Oh, they hate to see it)
But it's too late to throw your shade (Way too late)
It's too late to sing your hate (Way too late)
You won't rain on my parade (No, no, no, no)
Because I'm forever lit
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, I'm forever lit
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, I'm forever lit

[Outro]
Who fly to LA, go to a party, just go to a party and come home The rich and the famous
