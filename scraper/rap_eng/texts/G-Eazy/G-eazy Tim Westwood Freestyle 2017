[Intro]
Young Gerald, this is how it's happening
Ard
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse]
Hitting Britneys with the federline
I just speak my thoughts, I don't never have to edit mine
She been off the chow, higher than my credit line
Hard drugs, you'd be hard pressed to find a better time
I Got my mind made, I be setting mine
I could get the pussy fast, any place, any time
Free Kevin Gates
Yeah I'm really out my mind
Fuck you, exclamation, exclamation, underline
They ain't make me, I prayed for it, and i worked daily
They try  but they can't change me
Why you rappers don't eat?
'Cuz you're too fucking lazy
Pay no mind, I only chase Jay-Z or Shady
Smoking hella chronic getting faded
Money is Goliath yours David, we can't trade it
Got three girlfriends, three sex drives, I should probably braid it
Live a wild life 'cuz I made it
Listen, yeah uh
And i don't take dayoff exhibition game. but i still treat it like a playoff
Really no surprise, you put the work in, then it pay off
Look I be off the shits
I don't know what they off
Closing out some deals, know I'm fortunate, about to make a pay off
Fishing, you just never catch it, they just rip the bait off
Show the most love, go and get your hate off
Motherfucking Adolf
You about to fade off
This is not a hobby, this my job, what I'm paid off
10 Ms for 10 thousand hours was the trade off
They recognize the swag, then they go and rip it straight off
Nick K ripped John Travolta's face off
She undressed, I be certified finessing
But hoes be like busses, you miss one, then you go and catch the next one
A hero in the bay, I feel like Stephen
A legend, the best one
The check came, that's red rum
That's Red rum

[Outro]
Yeah, haha
