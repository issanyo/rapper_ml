All I could do
It's all I could do
All I could do
It's it's it's all I could do

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Take a look around I am not the usual
Music never stops like I'm in a fucking musical
I rap cause I don't never wanna work inside a cubicle
This music is, all I could do
Stoned to the bone thinking life is so beautiful
Sorry if you can't relate or this is all new to you
Ten bad bitches at my party all doable
Took one to my room it was
All I could do
You still rapping with a normal flow
I had your girl in the back giving oral slow
They be rolling up the finest California dro
It's all goodie, all this I am born to go
I'm just doing what I can, living like I'm supposed to
Most can't even comprehend what I'm close to
Blowing off a bitch right after she blows you
That's fucked up dog, but it's what the girl chose too
Cop me a zip, so I rolled me a fatty
Me and some bad chick blowing granddaddy
It's all I could do fool, don't get mad at me
It's just...
It's all I could do

[Hook: Devon Baldwin]
All I could do
It's all I could do
All I could do
It's it's it's all I could do
All I could do
It's all I could do
All I could do
It's it's it's all I could do

[Verse 2: Skizzy Mars]
Stellas and yellow cabs, I get haters hella mad
G said "get em" so I got at 'em extra fast
We in a city of blonde models and bombshells
But I got that ocean type swag, bitch I'm ill
I like moms who like Dons and don thongs
And like skinny black kids who like to write songs
They pull up in a Honda, we in Pagani Zondas
Getting money you promise? Syke
Wanda told me to be humbler
But every day I'm getting Facebook fans, and features on every Tumblr
Man, haters can't understand
They really can't stand the Heat, they just Cavs fans
Ay look, I get money out the ass and I don't fuck with bank accounts
Used to walk in but all my niggas buying tables now
These white girls got a fucking penthouse fetish
I got the crowd out on they toes like they fucking stretching
I told home girl to meet me in like 10 minutes
It's just me, G-Eazy and like 10 bitches
Got dreams of living lavish, rings like I'm the Mavericks
Man I'm a fucking savage, it's all I could do

[Hook: Devon Baldwin]
All I could do
It's all I could do
All I could do
It's it's it's all I could do
