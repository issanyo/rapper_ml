[Chorus: P-Lo]
Ooh, I'm high off the power
Ooh, she gone off the powder
Ooh, she want it up louder
Yeah, yeah, I'm high off the power

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Will it go to my head?
I'm Percin', takin' Henny to the head
Keep a model in my bed
She want to fuck, I'd rather get bossed up instead
And since '06 I been stuck to this bread like it's Elmer's on my hand
I can't get it off me
I'm too damn saucy, your girlfriend boss me
Coulda bought a house with what that new whip cost me
To do it this big, man, the job is exhaustin'
Be careful, this is not for everyone
Off the medicine, goin' hella dumb
My bitch got replaced when I found a better one
I'm straight to the point, I just go and get 'er done
I pull up, lookin' like the Dark Knight
I'm dipped in off-white, I'm probably off white
It's Heem in my system, we party all night
It's M's in my bank, my grandkids be alright

[Chorus: P-Lo]
Ooh, I'm high off the power
Ooh, she gone off the powder
Ooh, she want it up louder
Yeah, yeah, I'm high off the power
Yeah, yeah, I'm high off the power
Yeah, yeah, I'm high off the power

[Verse 2: Nef The Pharoah]
First Summer Jam I did I had to hop in the crowd
I'm power hungry, I'm addicted, ain't no stoppin' me now
Bay-Area president, and they didn't have to elect you
Come second, fake ass niggas be half ass steppin'
G tapped me like "Nef, you want to do a verse?"
"What's the topic?" He said "Power," hey, man, church
P-Lo on the beat, bass hit 'em where it hurts
Any obstacle they said I couldn't do, I conquered
Shoutout to the sponsors, keep me looking fresh at concerts
Sick with it, monster, my presence is an honor
Motherfuck your honor, free my real niggas that's locked up
I invest in stocks now, I done got my guap up (money)
I admit that I'm power hot
Slap the Benz in power drive
You don't got no power 'cause your pussy dry
When I was dead broke, you ain't even say "Hi"

[Chorus: P-Lo]
Ooh, I'm high off the power
Ooh, she gone off the powder
Ooh, she want it up louder
Yeah, yeah, I'm high off the power
Yeah, yeah, I'm high off the power
Yeah, yeah, I'm high off the power

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
I'm on the road to riches, and I got power steering
There's nobody like me, you can stop comparin'
I don't gotta say it twice, you got perfect hearing
Spendin' cash all day, I skrt skrt McLaren (yeah)
And that's a quarter million on four wheels
If you the best alive, then it means I'm on your heels
Before the year's over, I'm closing out more deals
I been through it all, man, I tell you how war feels
Top's the only place for me, that's where I live at
And your flow is garbage, like "damn, what is that?"
You're supposed to take over, oh, I must have missed that
A bitch with no money is what I really get pissed at
Yeah, Young Gerald, Neffy and P-Lo
Young legends from the Bay, it's a powerful trio
Swear the pyramid building is the size of my ego
Young rockstars like I lived the life of a Beatle (yee)

[Chorus: P-Lo & G-Eazy]
Ooh, I'm high off the power (yuh)
Ooh, she gone off the powder (yuh)
Ooh, she want it up louder (yuh)
Yeah, yeah, I'm high off the power
Yeah, yeah, I'm high off the power (yee)
Yeah, yeah, I'm high off the power
