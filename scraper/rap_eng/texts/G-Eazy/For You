[Intro: Lucy Rose]
It's a long time
Heard it all before
It's a long time
Tell me is this what you're looking for
It's a long time
Heard it all before
It's a long time
Tell me is this what you're looking for

[Verse 1: Phora]
I got too much on my mind
I've been tryna make some time (Aye, aye)
For you, for you, for you, you (Yeah)
And some people, they never change
But me, I've always been the same (Aye, aye)
For you, for you, for you, you (Yeah)

[Chorus: Phora]
Damn, I'm still down for you
I'll stick around for you (Aye, aye)
For you, for you, for you, you (Yeah)
I'm still down for you
I'll stick around for you (Aye, aye)
For you, for you, for you, you (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
I always drop it down for you
Time to do what we were bound to do
Everything I did surrounded you
That's why you're the one I'm grounded too
Let's just make it, let's just make it
Tryna be your ex is crazy
Tryna to find an exit baby
Tryna to find the exitâ€“ knowing that
I want you and you want too
And we act like we did not know
Knowing that we both knew, what we were gon' through
You were going through some other shit, I didn't know
I didn't know, feelings that I didn't show
Things that I could've did to make this grow, but I didn't
Keep focus, deep stroking
Love smoke inside it and we keep choking
She got me off it, oh

[Chorus: Phora]
Damn, I'm still down for you
I'll stick around for you (Aye, aye)
For you, for you, for you, you (Yeah)
I'm still down for you
I'll stick around for you (Aye, aye)
For you, for you, for you, you (Yeah)

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
(Ya know, I got you)
Kind of thought that it was time to move on
Time to leave here, like you put your shoes on
The heart is fragile that you left a bruise on
Summer nights and it gets hot as Tuscon
Arizona, I was thinkin' on you, had a few Coronas, yeah
But all you've shown us is you're indecisive
Don't know if you've noticed (Don't know if you've you noticed)
And I was honest when I looked at you and then I said "I promise"
I'll wait the longest if you comin' back because our loves the strongest (Straight up, yeah)
I'll be here, but I won't wait for too long
My friends don't agree, don't let me get proved wrong
So please say something before we're too gone
Never thought I'd be the one that you would do wrong
Fake love, fake hugs, numb the pain, take drugs
Light distraction, light buzz, we go out, nightclubs
Spending money, pay stubs, anything, to change us
That expression that your face does when I'm tellin' you how long this wait was (Damn)

[Chorus: Phora]
Damn, I'm still down for you
(Some people never change)
I'll stick around for you (Aye, aye)
(I feel like I always kept it a hundred with you)
For you, for you, for you, you (Yeah)
(I mean, tell me if I'm wrong)
Damn, I'm still down for you
I'll stick around for you (Aye, aye)
For you, for you, for you, you (Yeah)
