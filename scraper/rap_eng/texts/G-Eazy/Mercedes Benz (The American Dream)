[Hook: Janis Joplin]
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz
My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
So Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
All black leather seats, that's luxury
Riding doing drugs in her Porsche, that's gluttony
The rich girl that takes it all for granted, acts upiddy
She never knew about hard work, that's fuckery
Swear I got to college and I felt so out of place
Cause everyone around me had their parents dough to waste
To blow it on appearance, they just let it go to waste
They party on the beach, scene their pictures shown their face
Its so superficial but I want it all the same too
Limelight, you probably feel the same I don't blame you
I admit I want the kind of dough that might change you
Dreams of being on my way, I woke up when it came true
Soon as I'm rich I'ma cop a set of keys
And fit it to a whip manufactured over seas
Believe that he earns every dollar that he spends
All my friends drive Porsches I gotta make amends

[Hook: Janis Joplin]
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz
My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
So Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz

[Verse 2]
But I'll probably never fit that mold
Who else could ever flip this and make it sound like gold
Blow the dust off a record four decades old
Bridge the gap between cultures, made this shit sound cold
And all the moms love me now for samplin' Joplin
I'm stickin' with my team, I'm the rap John Stockton
I've been workin', playin' shows from Atlanta to Austin
They put me on the bill and all the rich hoes flocked in
I made this shit myself while you rap on a friends beat
I work my ass off just and I'm just making my ends meet
I cover mad ground like I'm running with ten feet
And I'ma keep grinding till I sit on a Benz seat
Soon as I'm rich I'ma cop a set of keys
And fit it to a whip manufactured over seas
Believe that he earns every dollar that he spends
I'ma blow it like the wind, I'ma cop a fuckin' Benz

[Hook: Janis Joplin]
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz
My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
So Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz
