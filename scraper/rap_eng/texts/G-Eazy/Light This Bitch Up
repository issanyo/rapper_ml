[Verse 1: P-Lo]
Ay girl let me see what you got
I dont rap if the beat don't knock
I need bass, make it fast
Every girl in the place shaking ass
That's that bay shit
Pull up in a space ship
All I rep is gang shit
You know that I can't quit
Yeah, we got step up the party, get it started
Make the hoes go retarded
Whole game with me we gon' ride out
You ain’t living, whatchu talking, we gon' find out

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Uh, Gerald
Pre game call a Uber then we all mob
Every night we do it all night big it's hard job
Part snob light it up like I'm part bob
Heartbreak kids linked up with the heart throb
In the scene always found in the mix
Move around with the wrist
Short told us if you’re rapping and the beat better pound when it hits
And I've been going dumb since 2006
If you're not family don't ask me whats up with a verse
Unless you're spendin' it what your girl has up in her purse
You see us pull up and it hurts
Girls climbing in the section calm down you a bucket of thirst
Can't shit with people as basic as those
I am out on the road getting payed for them shows
I walk through the grass check by snakes by my toes
Cause sooner or later all fakes get exposed

[Hook]
Yeah, no we don't really care
Yeah, we gone put it in the air
No we don't give a fuck
Getting bunnit's is a must, you can trust
Yeah, we gone' Light this bitch up
Yeah, we gone' Light this bitch up

[Verse 3: Jay Ant]
Uh, yeah
I don't talk real boy, I be listening
You a mark a toy, you a figurine
Your bitch love my grill and finger rings
I beat it up fuck fingering
Brown leather, all on my fucking bag
Bad bitches, I thought I could never have
Shake jelly, flat belly, thin waist, looking for the face
I am sipping eighteen, no chase
You can have that hoe, this ain't a race
I don't chase I replace
Give her a taste, show her first place
Weed plants in my socks and my dirty vans
Dirty hands 'cause I've been touching bands
Its the younger suffer, puffer
And I don't fuck with you suckers

[Hook]
Yeah, no we don't really care
Yeah, we gone put it in the air
No we don't give a fuck
Getting bunnit's is a must, you can trust
Yeah, we gone' Light this bitch up
Yeah, we gone' Light this bitch up
