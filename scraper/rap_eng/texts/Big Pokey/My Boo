[Chorus: Big Moe]
Ah, baby baby you know that you're my baby boo (My boo)
And I'm keeping it real, because you kept it true (True)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, me and my girlfriend

[Verse 1: Big Pokey]
See me and you, we two of a kind
Kicking it all day, I love it when you around
When you playing touchdown, I'm already waiting
Passenger pick up, waiting on my baby, huh
Lately, I've been in a bad mood
Is it me missing you, or this fast food
Catching attitudes, every five minutes
Baby let's go home, I'ma dive in it
Don't stop, doing what you do to me
I ain't never had a broad, to be true to me
It's new to me, I'm just being real
Thangs you do to me, how you make me feel
What the deal is, is it love man
You like the way a nigga do this thug thang
I'm on the love train, it ain't slowing down
I can't complain, it's going down, uh

[Chorus: Big Moe]
Ah, baby baby you know that you're my baby boo (My boo)
And I'm keeping it real, because you kept it true (True)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, me and my girlfriend

[Verse 2: Big Pokey]
Say baby, twist up this dope for me
I'm a weed head, ain't no hope for me
Get close to me, I'm yours to hold
Don't be insecure, I'm yours fa sho
Every pot got a lid and you fitting baby
I be trying to make a kid, when I hit it baby
To the left with it, in the side pocket
Body rocking, headboard knocking, uh
Bang bang, what's going on
We doing this damn thang, early in the morning
Huh, daddy make you fold up
Make you say "wait a minute, hold up"
Know what, you a dime piece
Fill a nigga up, like a nine piece
You could find me, you know my address
I'm trying to pull this arrow out my chest

[Chorus: Big Moe]
Ah, baby baby you know that you're my baby boo (My boo)
And I'm keeping it real, because you kept it true (Keep it true)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, me and my girlfriend

[Big Pokey]
On this last verse, I'm going fed with it
Hit niggas and bitches, in the head with it
Ain't scared with it, and ain't playing
In a minute, we fins to be parlaying
I can't lie, I'm loving this
Hate proof, ain't nobody budging this
I think one day, I'ma flood your fist
Before I flood yours, I'ma flood my sis
And my T, you know me, I'm a mama's boy
A grandma and bree, my pride and joy
I enjoy every second that I spend with you
For real, I ain't trying to pretend with you
I want ten with you, ten mo'
You fuck my head up, like the endo
It's, gon' go down
So let me put this, on your mind

[Chorus: Big Moe]
Ah, baby baby you know that you're my baby boo (You're my boo)
And I'm keeping it real, because you kept it true (Kept it true, I really do, me and you)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, me and my girlfriend
