[Chorus: Big Moe]
Down South we roll on choppas, on choppas
Down South we roll on choppeeers
Down South we roll on choppas, on choppas
Down South we roll on choppeeers

[Verse 1: Big Pokey]
Down south we roll on chop
Pushin' the big body  Benz with no top
Now stop
We bout to approach the red light
Sippin' red sprite, blue lens head lights
Betta find a night cuz I can beat my opponents
One deep blowin' sweets when I creep up on it
Finesse, headin' west
TV in the head rest
Leather and wood wheel
Place in front of my chest
Mercedes class S, Park Place on the plates
Big bodysittin' swoll
Like it been  liftin' weights
Stampidin' out the gates
100 miles per hour
V-dozen horse power
Got niggas mouth sour
Stayin' tall as a tower
Crawlin' slap supreme
Mashin' the gasoline
Under them 19's
Coach platineme
Wood grained contaminated
On the mob, paint job
Got the 6 lookin' ??

[Chorus: Big Moe]
Repeat 2x

[Verse 2:Big Moe]
Down south we rollin' nation wide
Popped up a Moe-y-yo in foreign ride
I put it down wit my kin Po-yo
On the low low
I'm a young pro
In the game I ain't lame, rollin' out on chop
Smokin' on the killa mary jane
And the job's freestyle
Playa buck wild
Big a Moe is a throwed child
I'ma lean, lean
Stackin' my green
Everytime you see a Moe-yo
I'm on the codeine
I'm out da damn Trey
A playa don't play
I'm bound to chop up the boulevard everyday
On choppers
Rollin on dem choppers
Rollin on chop
Rollin on chop

[Chorus: Big Moe]
Repeat 2x

[Verse 3: Big Pokey]
They got the fillas from three wheelers
To 20 inch rims pillas
Next week catch us on TV
Like "Look at dem niggas'
Slammin' doors
Hoes wanna creep wit dem
Sleep wit dem
Them boys roll deep dish rim
Down south is the spot
Where spokes get broke
Nine layers of clear coat
Flossin' wit  no note
40 inches round my throat
Wit a blingin' piece
On Vo's, doggin' my foes
Wit da bumper release
Me Chris, Magic, and Sweeps
We reppin' the Yella
Rappin' togetha
For life
We gonna rep it forever
Hoggin' the lane
Raise dat ass shake that thang
Hit all 16 switches we tryin' to break the frame
Nationwide in the game
Time  to expose our habits
Went from bustin' 9 carats
To v squares wit karats
I sear it, we throwed
Down south is the place
Sensei
Signin' off
It's all in they face

[Chorus: Big Moe]
Repeat 4x
