And I'ma keep my set on the neck, I'ma wreck
Niggas get they chin checked, nigga how it be
Niggas straight up raise up, on that Y.S.P
Don't go there, nigga if you don't know there
See I'm a pro there, niggas lay low there
Some niggas under the flo', because they tried to go there
You know say dog, this how it go down
I'm in the street with my fo' pound, ready to knock the do' down
Screaming S.U.C., and I'm finna go state to state
Back to back, pulling up in these S.U.V

Niggas know, I'm just straight like that cocaine
Fuck a nigga up, just like he tooted a line

Dropping hits, like a pipe linebacker

Cuz dog, these niggas they ain't with that
You know I'm saying, I ain't a felon
But I knock a nigga melon straight off his shoulder dog, plus I slung boulders
And I don't do that no more, I'm a rapper
That's why I'm laid back, maintaining my high I'm a high capper
You know I'm saying on this doja, I'm a high rapper
And I can lead these H-Town streets, I'm a high factor
Crawl like a tractor, niggas can't touch
Nigga cuz move around, S.U.C. my clutch

S.U.V., Screw where you be dog when I touch
When I reach I can't feel you, but I know you round me
Cuz, and these niggas know they can't sign me
Man niggas wanna kill me, but they can't down me
I'm in these cement shoes, and they still can't drown me
Where I'm at nigga, dog where Fat Pat nigga
Where Big Rue and Mafio, now where the gat nigga
Now wear they hat nigga, I'm on the field
And finna bust this hoe right now, I'm tight at my spat nigga
