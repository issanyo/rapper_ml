It ain't, no love
I ain't got time, to be messing with these scrubs
I'm too busy in these streets, coming up
Niggas wanna see you off your game fucked up, that's for real

[Mr. 3-2]
Pimp Chris, pimp-a-docious
My game ferocious, fly like a bird or a locust
Focused on getting it, all day long
I'm a million dollar nigga, and these streets got me wrong
Now who that man, who that talking down
On Showtyme, and the big Boss of H-Town
Screwed Up underground, connected with new timers
Niggas get dealt with, I'm squashing all drama
Call your mama, or your back up plan
Get slapped up man, fucking with a grown ass man
I never ran, I pull heat and start busting
Niggas talk a good game, but don't want nothing
Some'ing gotta give, in this YK3
It's either rap or sell dope, for the G-O-V
Southside of the tree, and I'm throwing up the dub
Get your money while you can, cause it ain't no love

[Big Pokey]
Ain't no love dog, love don't love nobody
When I dap niggas up, I don't hug nobody
I'm bout my cash flow, that's all a nigga mash fo'
Give me what's mine, is all a nigga ask fo'
Don't get your ass to', fucking with this hard nose
Ass nigga, with these hard hands boys know
I ain't no wanksta, I'ma hit the lot and cop some'ing
I'm a gangsta, I'ma get the Glock and drop some'ing
Stop bumping, be about your mail
Get paid, everytime you pull out your scale
Before I tuck my tail, I'll die on the field
Spend the rest of mine, in a eight-by-ten trying to kill
Bitch niggas squeal, real niggas ride
You steady talking loud, nigga kill or stay quiet
Pressure bust a pipe, but I ain't gon budge
Fuck the hype cause it ain't no love, for real

[Chris Ward]
With so much drama, in the Y.S.P
It's kinda hard, being C-W-A-R-D
But I, somehow some way
Keep coming up with funky ass shit, like every single day
With mo' flows, than the average
I'm on my toes with mo' clothes and mo' hoes, and it shows I ain't your average
If I see it, I just grab it
That's if I want it or I need it, or I just got that feel I gotta have it
Good pussy, I'ma stab it
Hop up in it hop up on it, hop all around it just like a rabbit
It's really, a bad habit
If you from H-Town you cop it drop it, you swang it and you slab it
Ooh-wee dag nabbit, I'm too fresh with my playerness
Some say I got, what the rest of these playas missed
That's why, I fuck the women that they wanna fuck
Or at least fuck the ones, that tell 'em they don't wanna fuck cause
