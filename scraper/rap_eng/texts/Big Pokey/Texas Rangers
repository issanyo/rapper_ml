[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]
See I'm a Texas ranger
No longer a stranger
My tab at the bar, cost more than your car
Got 500 horses, in my yard

[D-Gotti]
See I'm a Texas ranger, candy paint changer
Thoed in the game, and I don't rock no rings
Three wheel hangers, sliding through danger
Thank God, the Shop done came up
Now I'm saying blessings over lobster, and alligator tail
I'd done front an automatic, start SL
Birds on my peely pale boots, that them damn fools
Wrecking no, pull em back to life Benz Coupe
Disappearing roof, they trail me to the saloon
To have some dranks, we some cats from out the 2
Happy hour over soon, I dropped some on my tab
Give the bar tender five G's, and dab
Then I grabbed my dame, and slid out slow
'Fore I bobbed and weaved the lot, I pulled out slow
Now you know, Gott-O been thoed since the manger
But I'm blessed, to no longer be a stranger

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer]

[Tyte Eyez]
No longer a stranger, it's been 10 years in the Lone Star
I traveled from Louisiana, in a Lincoln town car
A little home sick I hit me, but right quick
I was right back in the mix, turning crumbs to bricks
Still not knowing I would be dropping hits, with Mr. Dix
He was still in Atlanta balling, that's what they called him
Penny fool back to Tex, and called that nigga D-Reck
Hooked up with P-A-T, then the Shop been in effect
Ever since I reminisce, about my G's that passed
And I continue to mash, like everyday is my last
And I know that in the long run, I might just get tired
But I'm building this empire, so my shorties can retire
At a young age done paid, dues in the great
State of Texas, coach leather  sattle on my Lexus
Don't test this 3rd Coast, born nigga or your life's in danger
With one in the chamber, I'm a Texas ranger

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer]

[Big Pokey]
I'm a T-E-X-A-S ranger
State, with some'ing in the chamber cause it's dangerous
We ain't strangers, struggling it's hard nottas
Hard blocks and drops, hard tops
Gotta get it, till my heart stop
And I'ma be here, until God set my alarm clock
I can't lie, I love my state
When I eat I flood my plate, I love my way
Every chance I get, I'ma rep for Screw
That was one of the realest, niggas I ever knew
True to the game, real Texas ranger
Was famous, but didn't let the fame change us
We some brain stainers, you could believe that
Swang on swangas, you gotta see that
This the place to be at, why
I can't explain, it's a Texas thang
