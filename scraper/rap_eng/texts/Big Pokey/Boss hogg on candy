These niggas don't understand me, cause I'm boss hog on candy
Pieced up creased, staying boss hog on candy
These niggas don't understand me, cause I'm boss hog on candy
Pieced up creased up, big Glock nine handy
These niggas don't understand me, cause I'm boss hog on candy
Pieced up creased, staying boss hog on candy
These niggas don't understand me, cause I'm boss hog on candy
Sipping on bar and brandy, with a big Glock nine handy

[Big Pokey]
Boss hog on candy, can't see up in my who-ride
Iced up with my Nike's on, 4-5 cocked when the coupe slide
Sweep it in then I sweep it out, back on the strip bout to burn it up
The same thang with the rap game, I'm back in the deck nigga turn it up
Fresh to death all the time, looking good crawling down
Stay up out my bidness baby, I don't need ya all in mine
A lot of niggas think they real, I can make em drink they meal
Push the barrel in they mouth, I can make em drink the steel
Vault money these niggas out here, trying to come up in a major way
Some of these niggas got live rides, ain't even much got a place to stay
Bout to check a nigga resume, everyday a nigga chasing grip
I keep my stash in gym class, that's why my grip know how to flip
Hit a corner mash the throttle, drop the window trash the bottle
Spit this pimping to a bitch, try to get that cash up out her
Bring your heart and your hustle with ya, and the cash'll follow
Sensei young stunner, and a runner, ask about him

I'm boss hog on candy, these boys don't understand me
Big Glock nine handy, I'm riding with my family
Play with mine I'ma start firing, and spray that nine till you hit the ground
Don't leave home without the iron, extra rounds in case it go down
It's off the chain in that H-Town, don't get caught slipping out of bounds
Them jackers here'll run up on ya, from behind an rob ya blind
Choke big smoke with Big Pok', let's show them boys that we ain't no joke
Tell whoadie pull out the slab, let's hit that Ave. in them 'Sacci locs
Fresh dressed from head to toe, I shut it down when I hit the do'
One thang fa sho I ain't broke no mo', still banging my music slow
Candy paint that's how you see me glow, fresh for life I know you see me hoe
Tell the truth you wanna be me bro, at your best you can't be me though
I'm boss bred out the 'Stead, Nawfside until I'm dead
Strapped up I ain't ever scared, to put a bullet in a hater head
Ten years still going fed, putting these young punks to bed
Keep it G that's all I can be, I'm riding some'ing like the hook said

[Big Pokey]
Boss hog candy paint, smoking kush drinking oil
Sliding with the heater up the feeter, heading to the 'vard
Swanging on the swangas hard, still sitting on 4-4's
Mo' money got mo' hoes, diamond chain bout four rows
Rape the block when I convert the top, peeling off on them low pro's
Pulling in the lot them hoes pose, TV's lit watching old shows
Hit the button drop the brim, swanging trying to walk the rim
Crock bull homeboy, all of the broads be jocking him
It's plain to see that I'm one of a kind, ride I'm in support my grind
Stash spot just to hold the nine, cause I got the back bumper folded down
Popping the trunks blowing purp', twisting squares out the sack
Hard top popped up, hitting corners in the Lac
Counting stacks on the daily Dina bout the dollar dollar
Butter guts red flo's, slamming do's popping collars
Bring your heart and your hustle with ya, and the cash'll follow
Sensei young stunner and a gunner, ask about him
