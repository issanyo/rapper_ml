(Big Pokey)
You're trippin me out, sho nuff
When you stroll up you make niggas fold up
Hold up, I been peepin your ways
Plus the pedal pushers and braids got my mind in a daze
You look sweeter than glaze, make me wanna misbehave
But you playin hard to get, you gotta run a trick play
Flea flickers, steady buying shots of liquor
All dogs chase the cat so it's a must I sick her
Hand picker, pretty face and toes
Check complexion and pose, see the choosen be chose
Then I turn up your nose, you been chose by a bachelor
I just had to distract you for a minute and holler at ya
It's mandatory I snatch her
Cause the statues'll knock at ya
Spend some time with Po-yo cause I ain't hard to adapt to
If you have to, just give it some thought, see what I'm about
Ain't no fusion, no doubt, can't lie, you're trippin me out

Trippin me out, trippin me out
Oh, she's trippin me out got me sayin hold up
Trippin me out, trippin me out
Oh, she's trippin me out got me sayin hold up

(Snow)
What me and you have, say strictly bout the cash
Not only bout the ass, that's how I got this S-class
I got my own cash, and I watch my own ice
Peeped the real in me huh? That's why you looked twice
Vision Snow in your life, holdin you tight
Relievin your stress as I caress you through the night
I'm the go get it type, to make sure we both right
No fuss, no fight and we can blow like dynamite
With you handlin your buisiness and me handlin mine
With us both on the grind we can't help but to climb
As far as time, baby, we got forever
But for right now, let's concentrate on this cheddar
And reaching higher levels, sportin diamond bezzles
Can you imagine the shit we can have together?
Me trippin? Never, I'm down for whatever
Snow and Po-yo, it don't get no better

Trippin me out, trippin me out
Oh, she's trippin me out got me sayin hold up
Trippin me out, trippin me out
Oh, she's trippin me out got me sayin hold up

(Big Pokey)
I ain't trippin, I'm just stunned cause you the bomb
I could see us in a six flippin like a baton
You set off my alarm, when you walk you perform
Spotted you in the crowd and picked you like a pecan

(Snow)
Well let's hop this don and discuss how we increase our funds
I know it drives you crazy when I talk in digits baby
Ain't nothin shady about this lady
Everything is everything and I put it down for you daily

(Big Pokey)
You got me fallin, baby
On top of that I can hear your body callin, baby
In the Impala so you know I'm boss ballin baby
Steady crawlin and the motor ain't stallin baby
It's all gravy
On sight you hooked me, whehn you spoke you shook me
First impressions be a trip and you immediately took me
I'm far from a rookie, star status of course
You the glass on the blaze driving me like a torch
That's why I want you by my side so I can flaunt you
You don't want a square, you want a thug nigga, don't you?
Let's bend us a corner, scratch off in the night
And everything's gonna be alright
It's goin down

Trippin me out, trippin me out
Oh, she's trippin me out got me sayin hold up
Trippin me out, trippin me out
Oh, she's trippin me out got me sayin hold up
