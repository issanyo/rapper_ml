(*talking*)
Cut the mic up, cut the mic up now
This for them G's out there, Lil' J-Face
Rap-A-Lot, feel this yeah

[Hook - 2X]
Power in the flower, power in the flower
All I ever wanted, was the power in the flower

[Big Pokey]
All I ever wanted, was the power in the flower
Moving a hundred miles per hour, nigga I'ma
Do my thang, make it come back like a boomerang
Arm & Hammer cocaine, a bunch of pocket change
One thang about this game, it's addictive
A lot of pro's and con's, hoes and guns nigga it's wicked
I ride dirty like Bun B and Pimp, I ain't parking my car
Got three microwaves, working with my fork in the jar
Stay splurging, digging in it like a surgeon
Then I feed it to 'em raw, pure as a virgin
When you fucking with me, you fucking with the best
Ounces hard, as a Japanese math test
We make a dopehouse, jump like a '64
Pitch the snow, if the laws happen to kick in the do'
Get your calico, in case it's a false alarm
If you get caught slipping, it's on

I'm a heavy weighter, when I rain I shower
In the kitchen and I'm mixing, flipping figgas and flour
Got this flower flipping, plus I'm making moves power ticking
A bunch of money, got a young nigga power tripping
Fucking these hoes, these niggas baby mamas sucking my pole
Focused man, stay in control
It'll take you fast, let you make some cash
Flip the script on you, break your ass
Have your game mask on, when you hit the flo'
Put your 4-4 in your pocket, 'fore you hit the do'
It's a game where money talk, violence control
Rule number one, silence is gold
Once you get your connect, then you get your change on
Then you get your respect, then you got your fame on
Cats'll get caught up, and get they aim on
That's what can happen to ya, when you get your name known

[Hook - 4X]

[Big Pokey]
You doing great now, your name packing weight now
High self-esteem, got you feeling like a eight now
You living in the states, with lakes
Electric gates, surveillance if they break in your place
You feeling, the other side of the game
It's gravy now, cause money ain't a thang
You got these hoes, you lining 'em up
The ones you really cut for, diamond 'em up
Your main hoe buy her a truck, it's the vida loca
If she steal from you, beat her and choke her
You don't make deals with smokers, you done graduated
Watch your back, cause them broke niggas agitated
I ain't exaturating, that's how the game go
To the top of the ladder, that's what you aim fo'
Keep your name low, and get your money on
Cause if you crap out, money gone
