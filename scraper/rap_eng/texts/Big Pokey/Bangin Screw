[Hook: 2X]
Banging Screw
That's what south side players do
Smoking sweets, pouring up 4's
Drippin' wet, top down on the low

[Big Pokey]
It's plain to see that I'm one of a kind
Ride I'm in expose my grind
Stash spot just to hold the nine
Plus I got the back bumper folded down
Know a young g for sure to shine
Princess cut, sure to blind
High from hydro I got the drank just the other day, blew my mind
Watch iced out can't see the hand
Diamond bezel, diamond band
4's spinning like a ceiling fan with the top off and the TV playin
All I'm doing is ball-and-parlaying
Ike or Jack does all my spraying
Best believe when I hit the club, be it 4's or dub's, I'm valet-ing
I'm front, maybe not
Might not park just roam the lot
Snatch the Glock up out the stash, steal the clip with a infra- dot
Streets is hot, stay ready for war
Blue, black, or red don't touch my car
Pour it in a pint don't touch my Barre
I'll burn that ass like a cigar
Stay cocked you know the rules
Got extra clip under my shoes
Riding deep with all my trues
Got extra clips for all our tools
Ain't trying to lose, that's why I refuse to lose when I'm on the roll
With the trunk up and the top down showing niggas how to roll

(Chorus)

[Lil' Keke]
This is something, to understand
In order to make a mill you got to have a plan
Leaving many stains in the Caravan
Trying to sit back and be the man
Tell the truth, never lie
Some of these niggas is getting fly
I'm gonna sit back and watch them die
Sipping on drank and staying high
Call me Ke, call me Don
Long as you know that I'm the one
Money by the ton is how I raise my son
Never leave my crib without packing a gun
I been a fool way back in school
Always knew to pack a tool
Catch a chill spot and keep it cool
In the Y2K I ain't change my rules
Better get yours, cause I'm gonna get mine
Trying to get paid without doing time
Throwed in the game and I had to shine
Looking at the roley, it'll keep you blind
Yes indeed, corners bleed, jamming Screw, smoking weed
All the time, gots to grind, that's how a young nigga's supposed to see
Now who it be on the count of three
Everybody here say CMG
Commission Music Group, now can't you see
Microphone check this is Don Keke
Just to let you know, before I go
Nigga gonna still get ten a show
I can put it down on a pen and pad but I was born and raised to be a freestyle pro

(Chorus)
