[H.A.W.K talking]

H-A-W-K
Pokey
Towdown
It's about to go down
Boy trendsetta
I need to let these people know that Towdown is a trendsetta maan!

[Verse 1: Towdown]
I'm from the land of longhorn and cattle
We ride leather and wood
Seatbelts with saddles
Chrome wagon wheels, carriages with candy paint
Instead of tumblin' weed, we been blowin' dank
From sun up to sun down
I lost that blood that's cold
I'm 100 for 100
6 shooters make 'em fold
My duro stay lit
My peeps be shinin
Wanted dead or alive posters in cities I'ma rob
Ain't no decidin when I'm slidin
I'm sluggin the chain
Southside stranglin' rangler
Strong armin' strangers
Days are hot and long
And the nights are restless
All my exes live in the best little whore house in Texas
The devil's ridin dirty from Georgia with two aces
I'm not Garth Brooks but I got friends in low places
How the south was won
Packin gats and stackin funds
Gotta know when to walk away
Know when to run

[Chorus: Joe Slaughter]
The Dirty South is what it's about
Poin up, smokin out
Keepin' it hot like the middle of June
Just some Texas tycoons makin' country rap tunes
The Dirty South is what it's about
Poin up smokin it out
Keepin' it hot like the middle of June
Just some Texas tycoons makin' country rap tunes

[Verse 2: H.A.W.K.]
I'm Houston's best kept secret
Uncut and raw
On this country western rap
Take 10 steps then draw
1 of da coldest you ever saw
Immortal outlaw
Watch me shred this track like a Texas chainsaw
Use adjectives and nouns
Sippin drank blowin pounds
And all the drugs I intake courtesy of Towdown
Whoa now!
I'm representin' the Dirty South
White cup in my hand
Philly blunt in my mouth
Bout to turn this party out
It's the H-A-W-K
Mr. ballin parlay
And smoke my life away
H-Town superstar
Sippin soda mixed with barre
Thought you never hear my lyrics over a bass guitar
My horse is a car
With a V 12 motor
And my carriage is a 4.6 Range Rover
The game is over
Settin them trends
Now this country western rap is officially in

[Chorus: Joe Slaughter]
Repeat 1x

[Verse 3: Big Pokey]
They say Down South is what it's about
We havin' beans and rice up in the pot
See what we got
It's the grease baby
We got chicks, candy tricks baby
And that hydro keep me wit' a fix baby
I spits the real
Stay dress to kizzill
From head to heel
Getting my shine on
I'm like a chandelier
Parlay nigga at the bar with a can of beer
Wearin tight jeans
With a mouth full of Skoal
Cold as a ice berg mouth full of gold
Rap game John Wayne
I said it befo
A Texas Tycoon plus a freestlye pro
Fo sho Down South
Them hoes is thicka
The slicka behind chrome doors are on liquor
Still my nigga it's hotta then June
They love it when we spittin' on the Country Rap Tune

[Chorus: Joe Slaughter]
Repeat 2x
