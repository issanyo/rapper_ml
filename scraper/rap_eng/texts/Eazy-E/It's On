[Movie Sample]
Today's a good day to die (screaming)

[Intro]
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Suck on these nuts, nigga, suck on these nuts
I tell 'em bow-wow-wow yippie-yo yippie-yay
Suck on these nuts, nigga, suck on these nuts
It ain't nuthin' but Eazy baby
He'll smoke two niggas cause they crazy
Talk a gang of shit but it dont phase me
That punk nigga Dre still pays me

[Verse 1]
Well, if it's on motherfucker then it's on, G
Now if it's on motherfucker then it's on, G
Hey mister prankster prankster
Story book gangsta
Back in '86 you wore pumps and mascara
Down with the motherfuckin' Wreckin Cru, bitch
But once a bitch, always a bitch and now the fuckin' switch
Fag, with stethescope now you sag
Body slammin' bitches make Dre a bigger man
Khaki sportin' loc's in a G ride
What set you from punk what set you from ride
Rip Van Winkle sleepin' nigga woke up and became a G
But you still don't impress the Eazy
Smoke a little sherm now you call that shit the chronic
Niggas on the westside call it bionic
I make a mill here, make a mill there
Fuck a bitch here, fuck a bitch there, yeah

[Chorus]
[Scratched in] Tell ya motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with [Eazy]
[Eazy-E] Well if it's on motherfucker then it's on
[Scratched in] Tell ya motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with [Eazy]
[Eazy-E] Well if it's on motherfucker then it's on
[Scratched in] Tell ya motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with [Eazy]
[Eazy-E] Well if it's on motherfucker then it's on
[Scratched in] Tell ya motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with [Eazy]
[Eazy-E] Well if it's on motherfucker then it's on

[Verse 2]
Old nigga Eazy-E went to the cupboard
To get Snoop Doggy Dogg a bone motherfucker
Here's another G
Or should I say a H, a I, a J, a K, a L-M-N-O-P
P for the pussy wussy wuffin' nigga broke
As a motherfuckin' joke
Talkin' about you want to smoke
The E to the A-Z-Y
Nigga this east side
Snoop Doggy Doggy Dogg you wanna try
187 on the E that ya sing
But you cling on my balls when I swing my ding-a-ling
Yeah, you got more juice like a plant of puppy water
First I'm gonna choke ya
Then I smoke ya, then I'm gonna
Toss ya in the back of my trunk
With the other punk
Smoking Death Row like I smoke a Phillie Blunt
Well if it's on motherfucker than its on, G
If it's on motherfucker than it's on, G

[Chorus]
[Scratched in] Tell ya motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with [Eazy]
[Eazy-E] Well if it's on motherfucker then it's on
[Scratched in] Tell ya motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with [Eazy]
[Eazy-E] Well if it's on motherfucker then it's on
[Scratched in] Tell ya motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with [Eazy]
[Eazy-E] Well if it's on motherfucker then it's on
[Scratched in] Tell ya motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with [Eazy]
[Eazy-E] Well if it's on motherfucker then it's on

[Verse 3]
Still a nigga, once a nigga, always a nigga, down from the get-go
Never let go, never flossin'
Never slippin', never trippin', stickin'
Dick and my balls down your throat, doggy, listen
Niggas from the LBC they never heard of ya, G
And niggas from the CPT ain't down with D-R-E
But ya gave it up still, like a trooper
Let 'em play ya jam shake ya hand and then they shoot ya
You can fool the people on the east coast an the mid-west
But In LA you still can't pass the test
See I can tell a pussy when I see one
Dre wearing lip stick that mean ya have to be one
You need to change your sex and your occupation
You try to fuck with E nigga Run Run Run
Cause if it's on motherfucker then its on, G
Now if its on motherfucker then its on, G

[Chorus]
[Scratched in] Tell ya motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with [Eazy]
[Eazy-E] Well if it's on motherfucker then it's on
[Scratched in] Tell ya motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with [Eazy]
[Eazy-E] Well if it's on motherfucker then it's on
[Scratched in] Tell ya motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with [Eazy]
[Eazy-E] Well if it's on motherfucker then it's on
[Scratched in] Tell ya motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with [Eazy]
[Eazy-E] Well if it's on motherfucker then it's on
