[Verse 1: Toker]
Kicking back at the hood with some crazy vatos
Got some hynas lined up pero pa'mas al rato
Now I'm strolling down my calle and I'm packing my Glock
Seen a basehead on the way and I sold him some rock
Put his twenty with my thirty and made a 5-0
Went around the block to buy a sack of indo
Now I'm strolling back smoking chronic on the way
I gotta grab more dope to make feria for today
Now I'm standing on my corner serving some D
When some putos drove up and took a blast at me
So I pulled out my quette and never hesitated
Came up and started blasting cause I knew they couldn't fade it
Toker's on the loose and I'm straight gang related

[Hook]
Gang related, gang related, gang related
Gang, related, gang related, gang related
Gang, gang, gang related

[Verse 2]
I shot a fool in the shoulder and one in the head
Didn't know how bad it was or if that puto was dead
Ran to the hood to let the homeboys know
Ese keep trucha tonight cause these putos might roll
Took my quette to the spot where I knew it was cool
Started packing another cause that's the golden rule
So I jumped in the ranfla that my homeboy Trigger had
Hit a couple of corners and got rushed to the pad
Hit up some brown khakis and a white t-shirt
Put a lot of starch on it cause I knew it couldn't hurt
Sat back on the couch rolled up another ounce
Couldn't help but laugh at these putos I shot
Turned on the radio, it was Lighter Shade of Brown
Turn that shit back off, cause these putos ain't down
Vatos these days, some of these putos come fake
Talking gangster shit but didn't ever bust a grape
You don't gotta like me cause I've always been hated
Toker's on the loose and I'm straight gang related

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Jumped in my ride, started bumping my signs
Threw in an old tape of More Bounce to the Ounce
Rolled down the street headed towards the hood
But when I got there shit wasn't looking too good
Two black and whites and a couple of narcs
And on the hood of one car they had my homeboy Shark
So I busted a U and headed back to the spot
To question the homies on any info they got
The juras came back and they were looking for clues
They got my homeboy Shark for having blood on his shoes
They took him to the station to see if he would break
Didn't say shit and got shot to East Lake
Straight to K and L cause the vato wouldn't tell
Told the juras too (fuck off, go to hell)
And that's the only thing that was ever stated
Cause you don't say shit when you're gang related

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Couldn't go to the hood for a week or two
Always smoking some puto that I never knew
Just kept on banging and didn't take it serious
Hitting ten dollar sticks and acting delirious
Not giving a fuck about all the dirt we done
We just sat back and laughed cause this shit was all fun
Toker's out banging and I can't be faded
I'm a true ass loco and straight gang related

[Hook]
