Domm, doom, doom, doom, doom

(Krazie)
Killa

(All Bone)
Me killa, mi killa
Drug dealer, scandalous nigga
Lous nigga, -lous nigga
Come again me say, me killa, me killa, me killa
Gravedigger, scandalous nigga
Lous nigga, -lous nigga, -lous nigga
Caught ya slippin' so I had to put a slug up in your chest
Should've wore that vest
Talkin' shit'll only get that ass put to rest
A nigga, come, come flex
Hey, get the yayo, don't fuck with the Bone
When I'm hangin' and bangin' and slangin'
Swangin' blows to the dome
Nigga, watch that chrome
Bodybag that ass on, home
Me killa, me killa, me killa
