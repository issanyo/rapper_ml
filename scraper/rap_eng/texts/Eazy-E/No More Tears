[Intro]
Eah, you know how it is
Born and change, dying in pain
Praising the devils hands so we compriscate your body like contravene hahah
Oh you don't know, a Grim Reaper is a gangsta
And when the daddy want you, why the fuck you gone run ha?
(laughs)

[Hook]
Now we kickin' back, getting blasted
Reminiscin' how she looked in the casket
Now we kickin' back, getting blasted
Reminiscin' how she looked in the casket
Now we kickin back, getting blasted
Reminiscin' how she looked in the casket
Now we kickin back, getting blasted
Reminiscin' how she looked in the casket

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
Damn, another bitch dead
It's a shame that she is gone took two the head
Got caught in the mix
It's sad, I'm gonna miss this bitch
She was all this
She was all that
Point black, baby was all fat
Now we lay her down to sleep
Made my nigga rest in peace
Now we kickin' back, getting blasted
Reminiscin' how she looked in the casket
Paid my respect and didn't shed a tear
Eazy muthafucking E CPT and I am outta here

[Verse 2: Phalos Mode ]
It's like pay me stories in a cold cruel world
I'ma share story 'bout a gangster girl
From the plane to the train
Fall of from a groupie, a down bitch
Put a key up in her coochie
And she only fucking with ballers, living the live
So fine but never thought she be smoking the pipe
And when her boyfriend is away, she doing her damn thing
Coming up show nigga misses some cocaine
But It ain't a shame anyway
So you know, we yo, getting guns
Put on a nigga cuz of a ho
Yeah the bitch gots to go
Step to the house, looked to the shower
The Bitch looking like a Tina Howard
Make sure the ghost was clear
Cock the gat, shit is certain
Went to the door put 5 in her cunt and
That's the way love goes when you fucking with scandalous hoes
Semi-automatic my folks peep the scenario

[bridge]
Her name was Tina, Ooh you should've seen her
Face like a dog
Body like a ballerina (like a ballerina)
Caught a case everyday in the past of pasedane
Felony possession but it changed to a misdemeanor (changed to a misdemeanor)
She was selling that ass to make beer
Body fly jewels And fancy wear
Hanging with pimps, Killers and dopefiends (dopefiends)
Got hooked on Crack, and won't ever get clean (get clean)
Every night she with a different trick (a different trick)
In dark back alleys garglin' on dick
Oh shit (oh shit) what a wasted bitch
Callin' coroner quick
A dead body in a ditch (body in a ditch)
Is it her? Ooh I hope not hope not (I hope not)
I just seen her last week at the dope spot (at the dope spot)
But they made a positive ID
Tina was dead, and what a tragedy (what a tragedy)
Momma yellin' out somebody pray for me
But she abandoned her at the age of 3
But just that's the way life goes in these scandalous streets
So I'll write hardcore lyrics with these gangsta beats

[talking]
So choose now, life or death
Longs with breath
Or no air in your fucking chest
Either way, whether you decide to evade
Or decide to stay
That muthafucka death
Always, I said always collect jacks made of flesh
Yeah, yeah?

[Hook]
Now we kickin' back, getting blasted
Reminiscin' how she looked in the casket
Now we kickin' back, getting blasted
Reminiscin' how she looked in the casket
Now we kickin' back, getting blasted
Reminiscin' how she looked in the casket
Now we kickin' back, getting blasted
Reminiscin' how she looked in the casket


Fuck me up man
Keep it real
I remember..  yeah I remember exactly how she looked
When i want in her I will..
I just finish smoking
Then i she didn't look the same tha bitch was trip
I don't mean to call her bitch but she didn't look the same
But she looked like (she did now)
But she looked she had just smoked the joint (done deal)
I mean..I know death I know death ain't didn't play with it
The bitch didn't looked dead (we all gotta go)
She looked high
There's difference between being dead and being high....
Dead don't feel like being high
