[Intro]
Oh yeah, you know what I'm saying
We peel mothafuckers caps around here
You can't come around here talking that shit
You'll get a mothafuckin' bullet in your head and wind up dead
You know what I'm saying
I'll send you home in a bodybag you fag
And I'mma tell you something right now
Don't come to the alley with that bullshit
(Hey Ren, who's talking shit?
Hey nigga where that shit happenin' at loc?)

[Verse 1]
Right up my alley I see fiends and things
But you know it ain't over 'till the black nigga sings
And he's singing the blues and holding shoes
While he's zipping off booze
Cause every week he sees niggas killed on the news
In the alley all the hard heads kick it
Don't permit the suckers cause they ride the motherfuckas
Niggas getting high and high 'till they drop
So fucked up they start shooting at the cops
So ladies complain but there ain't shit they can do
Or run dead in the house slap the bitches with a shoe
I sell my dope and I ain't ashamed to say it
Cause I got bills and mothafuckaz won't pay it
In the alley - bitches sell pussy real cheap
Waiting around the trick when the fucka fall asleep
Bitches 15-16 got the claps
And crabs in their pussy crawl around in the naps
Fucked up ho's with toe jams in the toes
Dirty ass clothes, with boogers in their nose
Roaming, roaming looking for dick to suck
Walk around in the days like they don't give a fuck
In the alley

[Interlude]
Hey man, look at these mothafuckin' basehead bitches
Nigga you pop a gang of shit but ah nigga, where you from?

[Verse 2]
Right up my alley niggas trip cars that they stole
And niggas outside liftin' weights, getting swole
Takin' turns, sipping on the 40 O Z
Popping some funky shit by the D.O.C
I'm with my nigga Lil' Nation, or my homey named Snoop
My nigga DJ Train be hitting corner in de coop
Pulling up I give him dap - ask him if he put in work
Lookin' like a straight G - with some khakis and a T-shirt
We sit at the table wrapping bones
While the little BG's fight with the sticks and the stones
Trying to get a name for the self yo but why
So all the little buckets getting the G into a driveby
Take down some rivals across town
Then back to the alley where they can't be found
Police come around and try to find them
But the whole fucking set is standing right there behind them
Open up fire on the pigs now they cook
They didn't know what hit 'em cause the niggas had to get them
In the alley

[Interlude #1]
Officers down, officers down, we need assistance in the alley

[Interlude #2]
You're talkin' shit but where was you nigga?

[Verse 3]
Standing in the alley with my brother Juvenile for a while
This nigga try to rush it but the fool was living foul
Tried to get a name but did it the wrong ways
My brother cock the fuck out to his ass in the days
People crowded aroound like a fly on shit
Everybody had to stand cuz there ain't nowhere to sit
This little punk he was new to the alley
He grew up with some white mothafuckaz in the Valley
Now he's on his back looking up in all these faces
I bet he won't open up his mouth in no more places
And he don't know, he won't go but now he has to go
My brother picked him up and started beating him some more
Then every nigga had to get a turn
To make sure that this mothafucka learn
Niggas kicking him, hitting him with bricks
Check it, and my homey lit his pitbull bite off his dick
And to top it off before my brother left the scene
He emptied up his click with the whole 15
In the alley
