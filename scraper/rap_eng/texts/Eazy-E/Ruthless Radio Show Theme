[Dirty Red]
Straight up and down
And those that's not knowing, it's 6'o clock
And the Ruthless Radio Show is in high gear
So strap up fools and let's ride the yellow brick road to Compton
My mellow E is in the house
My city G's is in the house
My I.E's is in the house
And I'm Dirty Red. Yeah- I'm in the house

[Eazy-E]
Come on, come one, let's take that ride
Eazy-E, CPT, OG from the other side
Rolling my 6-double O 92. Trey on my radio
Oh, got heat under my seat
Watch my back as I bump the beat
Double law, ese
Now, want to hit some corners
Jump up, jump in, rag on top of toners
Talking about staying true to the street
Well, now you got it, Eazy-E on the beat

[Slow Pain]
I biggie bounce on the west coast
Flavor for the 9-4, 6-4 Impala, the suicide dose
Hopping and jumping, kangarooing around the streets
Ruthless Radio, 92, the beat
The Compton bang, Eazy-E's in the house
The Free o School DJ is in the house
Tony G, can I get a little cut
Julio G, can I get a fat cut
Yella got the freak of the weekend in the backseat
Ready or not here, I come
It's the baldy show and I'm on the run
Three deep, click, click, bang, bang
Stick them up, it's a Ruthless thing

[JV]
Well, it's the firme hyna
Creeping up behind ya
The neighborhood queen gets me when I find ya
A.L.T., 92-3
What you be doing on the Boulevard with me

[A.L.T.]
I'mm be bouncing, flossing, riding, gliding
Yelling out Ruthless driving my side in
Life it back up with the draulics, you call it
Two for one, is the two alcoholics
What do you know, hardcore went radio
Yeah, I'm Mexican and you still can't fade me though
A.L.T'en., Slow Pain straight G'en, Eazy-E'en, 92. 3'en

[Kid Frost]
It's like two for the trouble, one for the time
Three for the Glock and four for the nine
Five for the shells, six for the clip
Seven for the fools that trip
Now listen 92. east side 3 is the beat
OG Frost rolling down the street
A cutie by a couple of freaks that we meet
So let me here you say "oh" if your down with the show
I like to bounce and rock, staid, then roll
But when I bootlift, it's like Ruthless Radio

[Eazy-E]
Hit'em up, hit'em up 92. Trey
Ruthless Radio Show okay?
We got the bigger the week and Tony G
DJ Yella and Jesse
And everybody in the house say "Oh"
And for the ladies, another G, Julio
Yo, this is Eazy-E
You're listening to 92.3, The Beat
Yo Yella, kick it, kick it, kick it, kick it
