(Hook): Ice Cube
West side rolling, all day, everyday
Got your bitch open, you're fucking with heavyweights
Like, where they stay on my space
And stay the fuck outta my face

(Hook): 2Pac
Motherfucker west west y'all I'm straight ridah, I'm straight ridah, I'm straight ridah, I'm straight ridah, I'm straight ridah, I'm straight ridah, I'm straight ridah, I'm straight ridah

(Verse 1): 2Pac
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers
'Til we die, Westside! My garage full of cars that bounce
Movin' my tapes in major weight 'cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They runnin' off at the mouth 'til I fill it up with my pump
They jump, my automatic keep 'em weary
While you frontin' like you Billy Badass, nigga, you scary
I been knowin' you for years, we was high school peers
In Junior High I was itchin' to kill, and you was ready to die
While you bullshittin' niggas was dyin' and catchin' cases
Bustin' my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leavin' no trace, they see my face and they buried
Bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride, and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfuckers die Westside! when you see me nigga holla my set and watch we ride outlaw motherfucker till we die still ballin

(Hook): 2Pac
Motherfucker west west Westside! I'm straight ridah, I'm straight ridah, I'm straight ridah, I'm straight ridah, I'm straight ridah, I'm straight ridah, I'm straight ridah, I'm straight ridah

(Lil John):
Come on You fuckin' with the motherfuckin' realist niggas

(Verse 2): Ice Cube
We run A-Town, we run LA
Now get down on your motherfuckin' belly
Before this AK make you do a ballet
It's the nut cracker, I'm the linebacker
Three motherfuckers, hard as concrete
Y'all motherfuckers soft as Gandhi
Pull that thing out, now you a zombie
All down with you know where I be
West side rolling, all day, everyday
Got your bitch open, you're fucking with heavyweights
Like, where they stay on my space
And stay the fuck outta my face
Ghostwriters I'm on ya'
From Atlanta, Georgia to California
This shit can't go no longer
And when I catch ya, I'm a-don ya

(Hook): 2Pac

Some motherfucker's gotta die!
I'm an evil motherfucker ready to tear shit up
I'm gonna put these things on you, and never let up
See, my momma...she was wrong when I was born
That a nigga like E should'a never been born
Too late, big mistake in '72
It's '92, now the year of code blue
15 hours..11 minutes..30 seconds
I'm a motherfuckin' wreck
Gonna pay back niggas who did me wrong in the past
My days ain't long
I'm comin' strong and fast
Lock up 8 niggs..kill up 10 pigs
Innocent and fuckers are also dyin, too
Now what else can I do?
Fuck, fuck, fuck and plant my seeds
Leavin' kids in this world like me
The lunatic psycho mutherfucka Eazy-E
