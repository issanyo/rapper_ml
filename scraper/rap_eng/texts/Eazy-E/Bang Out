[Verse 1: Tyga]
Hold up, money talk so you know what?
Ain’t nothing to talk about, you ain’t got enough cuz
Rock star drugs break a bitch heart, no love
Emma Watts, Charlie Sheen, fuckin' with no scrub
Niggas want connects, got no plugs
Nigga say they high, got no buzz
Popsicle niggas wanna talk shit then say you froze up
Young niggas wanna pop pills, just po up
Went on a bang, Went on a bang
Bitches came for me and my nigga eazy
Threw that bitch out, got that ho one way
Said she tryna stay, told that bitch no way
That’s a preme nigga, B ripper, grim reaper
I don’t get mad bitch, I just get even
T-Raw magician, I don’t gotta trick or treat it
That Ferrari California make a bitch a believer

[Chorus]
Million dollars’ worth of cars, all paid out
See you niggas hatin, had to pull my chains out
Make it rain even when it’s rained out
Turn up, bang out
Bang out, bang out
Turn up, b-bang out
Million dollars’ worth of cars, all paid out
See you niggas hatin, had to pull my chains out

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Met a bitch last night, won’t believe it
Fuck her so hard, bitch probably stopped breathing
Killed the pussy, in the hotel screamin
Knock knock, going in like the housekeeper
The room, keep it
I fucked now I don’t need it
T-Raw semen splattered on a bitch beaver
Pipe dreamin, fuckin with a real baller
The bitch is a bitch so I’m gon call er
Then they act up, call the backup
Don’t matter, as if she ever mattered
Bitch shut up, throw it up, I throw the set up
Tell her sit up, got her face down, bitch don’t put yo head up
Yea, bitin on er ear
Got a old bitch, pussy like souvenir
I hop up in it, nigga I ain’t never scared
Closet full of straps and the condom right here
What I got?

[Chorus]
Million dollars’ worth of cars, all paid out
See you niggas hatin, had to pull my chains out
Make it rain even when it’s rained out
Turn up, bang out
Bang out, bang out
Turn up, b-bang out
Million dollars’ worth of cars, all paid out
See you niggas hatin, had to pull my chains out

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Beef on the street, to the beach I be rollin
Never see me strollin, 40’s I be holdinGirls in the daisies, drive easy crazy
Rolled up my windows as I turned on my AC
Rollin down Crenshaw, see the hoes jockin
Sunday nights poppin, see the foes hoppin
My stereo’s bumpin that ATL funk
You can call it what you want
Either way the shit bump
I’m a evil motherfucker ready to tear shit up
I’mma put these things on you and never let up
See my mama, she was home when I was born
Bet a nigga like to eat shit than never been born
But I ain’t going out unless 30 niggas die
I’m dyin anyway so I’m thinkin suicide
Shut the fuck up nigga cuz you ain’t seen shit
I’m bout to take this blade and straight up rip

[Outro: Ice Cube]
A bitch is a bitch
So if I’m poor or rich
I talk in the exact same pitch
Now the title of bitch don’t apply to all women
But all women have a little bitch in em
