[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Listen as he executes the funky flute
He can play it and I know it so watch him blow it
While I be speakin deep down in your eardrums
How do you like it? So yo won't'cha just come
Closer so you can see who's playin that funky sound
That's goin down and ya sayin that
Jimmy Z is the one you like to see
On the F-L-U-T-E yeah

[Bridge: Jimmy Z]
You wanna blow it baby? (Yeah)
You like to blow it don't cha? (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
The funky funky flute is just what Jimmy gave ya
But witta hip-hop flavour
