(Intro)
Ayo Stan, Dre layed the tracks, I'm laying the vocals
We need some guitar that ROCKS, know what I'm saying?
So um, let's do this

(Verse 1)
She's a rich girl, but not the ordinary
Extraordinary, a little too much to carry
Possessed by a demon on a mission
No man alive can refuse her proposition
From this fantasy, but to me she was more than
A bad dream, she was a nightmare for man
Took her sex appeal and she taunted
Twisted the brother until he did just what she wanted
Direguard the laws of the other man
Sacrificing the plight of the brother man
I'm not the type to let a woman make me weary
But to resist, he'd have to be a fairy
Nothing that a brother wouldn't want to indulge in
Drives a Porche and her purse is bulging
Her body in the form of a romantic medly
But be warned, she's beautiful but deadly

(Verse 2)
She's all about the bank roll, you can tell by the gold
Eyes deep enough to engulf your soul
She's like Medusa, but you won't turn to stone if you watch her
One fatal look is all it takes and she's got ya
On your knees and no more to spend
And you're still thinking how you want to see her again
It'll be difficult, but boy it ain't no joke
Saying nothing going on but her rent and a car note
You're wondering how in the hell
Little knowing you're the reason that she lives so well
Guessing so hard you'll submerge her attraction
But she go so many, son, you're a subtraction
Now you roll like you're crazy
Attitude is send down with being spacy
Never will I let this stupid bitch get ahead of me
I know the scoop, the bitch is beautiful but deadly

(Verse 3)
She'll keep you mystified like a swami
For you to slow her down, you'll need an army
Of a thousand strong brothers with a gun
But if they're careless, then they're done
She's an animal not to be taken lightly
Once she has a grip and squeezes tightly
You're in line for such a wonderful kiss
It'll cloud your site like the morning mist
No compassion, the minute after you're a slave
Breaking the law making sure she's paid
Yo, you oughta know the girl you see at every concert
She's in the back with the tightest dress looking the best
Know what I'm saying? You have to do like my man Cube
Tell the females that "I Ain't the One"
Cause if you don't, regularly you're back doing it readily
It's all to keep up the pace with someone beautiful but deadly

[Outro: Eazy-E]
I got big ass lay law in the house
Told me to make one for the motherfuckin' white boys
So I made this funky shit here for your motherfuckin' ass
I got my boy Jiggy Jigg in the house
Big ass Dre is in this shit as well
Dr. Dre go out there and motherfuckin' shit on this bullshit
So if you white boys don’t like it
I’m gonna send Dre to beaat your motherfuckin' ass
Hahahahahahahahahaha
