[Court Officer: D.O.C]
Right about N.W.A. Court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A. Vs the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Korde, Ice Cube
And Eazy-mothafuckin-E

[The Judge: Dr. Dre]
Order, order, order
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?

[Witness: Ice Cube]
You goddamn right!

[Dr. Dre]
Well won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

[VERSE 01: Ice Cube]
Fuck the police coming straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on, and throwing in jail
We can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
Fucking with me cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searching my car, looking for the product
Thinking every nigga is selling narcotics
You'd rather see, me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rolling in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swoll off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me, huh
A young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dying in L.A
Yo Dre, I got something to say

[Hook]
Fuck Tha Police (Repeat x4)

[Scene 01]
[Cop] Pull your god damn ass over right now
[Ren] Aww shit, now what the fuck you pullin me over for?
[Cop] Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up
[Ren] Man, fuck this shit
[Cop] Aight, smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!

[Dr. Dre]
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

[Verse 02: MC Ren]
Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang, is with whoever I'm stepping
And the motherfucking weapon is kept in
A stash box, for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, "Fuck you punk!"
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it punk, and I'mma fuck you up!
Make you think I'mma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'mma smoke them now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfucking villain that's mad
With potential, to get bad as fuck
So I'mma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
{*BOOM, BOOM*}
Yeah, something like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Taking out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say

[Hook]

[Scene 02]
[Cop] {*knocking on the door*}
[Eazy] Yeah man, what you need?
[Cop] Police, open now
[Eazy] Aww shit
[Cop] We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
[Cop] Get down and put your hands up where I can see 'em
(Move motherfucker, move now!)
[Eazy] What the fuck did I do, man what did I do?
[Cop] Just shut the fuck up
And get your motherfucking ass on the floor
(You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
[Eazy] But I didn't do shit
[Cop] Man just shut the fuck up!

[Dr. Dre]
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

[Verse 03: Eazy-E]
I'm tired of the motherfucking jacking
Sweating my gang, while I'm chilling in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass -- or maybe cause I blast
On a stupid-ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
Cause the police always got something stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me, or another nigga
And with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(MC Ren: Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rolling, keep looking in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rolling off the 8, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing this is what I'll say
[SCENE 3]
[Cop] walking to the window
[Breon] Hello, officer? I...
[Cop] Step out the fucking car!
[Breon] Why officer?
[Cop] Just step out the fuckin car!
[Breon] I know my...
[Cop] points gun at Breon
[Breon] Officer what have I've done?
[Cop] Because I can and I will!
[Breon] Man, what the fuck!?!

[Dr.Dre]
BreonKPrince, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

VERSE 04:
Fuck tha police, looking at me just as
A brother wit a skin color
Ok tryin say that to my mothafuckin
Mother who's in the gutter
Born and raised in a ghetto youth
Now I'ma teenager
Police look at me like I'm a goddamn gangster
Shootin us right on site
Because they know that they can
Get away because they is white
Fuck Tha police, cause they think it's
OK cause we ain't white so the judge won't indite
Where's our mothfuckin laws and rights
Lost in our world of thug life
They have the nerve to kill the minority
Rather than fix us a priority
We can't walk in the streets without
Someone stalking us with false authority
Fuck tha police, cause a nigga
Gotta have his hoodie down
When you people come around
Cause the color of our skin is brown
So fuck this when you fuckers
Try and touch and bust this
Cause you police don't got the slighest clue of
What us blacks have too go
Through when we looking at you
But we got too do what we gotta do
So no more brothers under sheets
Fuck tha police and let us be and
Let there be peace in the streets

[HOOK]

The Verdict
[Dre] The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck
White bread, chickenshit motherfucker
[Cop] But wait, that's a lie! That's a god damn lie!
[Dre] Get him out of here!
[Cop] I want justice!
[Dre] Get him the fuck out my face!
[Cop] I want justice!
[Dre] Out, right now!
[Cop] Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!

[Outro: BreonKPrince]
