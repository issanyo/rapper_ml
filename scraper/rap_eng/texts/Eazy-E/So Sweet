[Erick Onasis]
Yeah, check it out
Where Eazy at man? (I think he over there dude)
Where he at? Damn (Oh aight cool)
Yo, I'm the rocka man (Who?)
Glock cocka man (Who?)
Blocka blocka man
(You!) can't stoppa man
Technique I freak
Make chicks strip to bare meat
Leavin' nuttin' on but their shoes
No rules, I'm dumbin' out in the bathroom
Gettin' sucked off 'till I bust off
E single to mingle
Blow somethin' in they ear to make'em tingle
Earrings watch'em jingle (uh!)
Leave the spot jump in the car escape
Bouncin', with the new biggie smalls tape
Dead wrong down sunset haven't had fun yet
Me not the E, you wanna make a bet?
Remember this, lounge you in the danger zone
E got the blocks on snipe the drop zone (uh!)
Peep the whip, I'm sittin' on twenty inch Brobbit's
And y'all sittin' on garbage (huh!)
Feel me baby the way I be movin'
Watch what I'm doin', got the spot brewin'
Off the hook in here, you can smell it, gangsta
I'll let Eazy E tell it

Chorus [Eazy-E] (4x)
Feel the beat!
Bein' a gangsta is so neat
Yeah! Gangsta beat for the street

[Eazy-E]
I got beef for the street to the beach I'll be rollin'
Never see me strollin'
40's I'll be holdin'
Girls in the daisys drive eazy crazy
Rolled up my windows as I turned on my ac
Rollin' down crenshaw see the hoe's joggin'
Sunday nights poppin'
See the 4's hoppin'
My stereo's bumpin' the A-T-L funk
You can call it what you want
Either way the shit bumps

Chorus (4x)

[Erick Onasis]
Yeah, yeah yeah feel me y'all (who?)
The emcee y'all (yo!)
Who I be y'all, E, that's me y'all
Shining call me the black Jack Nicholson
Heeeres Erick, for those that's listening
Yeah, I'm right there block the glare when you stare
Cover your face when I'm in the place (uh, uh)
E, the boy in the east, got green eyes wit' telekenisis
Keep dime pieces, snatch ya feat, it's a full time jack move (Riiiight!)
Eazy E and E make a jack move
The combo ya hear here, sound so sweet
Gangsta beats for the streets

Chorus (4x)
