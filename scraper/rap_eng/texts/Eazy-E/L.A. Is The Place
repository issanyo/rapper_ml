La is the place

I'm not a renegade but you wish I was
Just cuz I like 2 hang wit da boyz n the hood

Live in la always chill on the west coast
A tilly mogul got it close just I mean to boast

I said whassup we'll who be ridin on you
Nickname eazy-e and I'm down wit da crew

Come talkin that trash
We'll burn your car
He let the brun(k)(it's not the bronx?)
It's la
But just as hard

Don't get me wrong I like to brag on the city I own
Subway rtd don't ride it alone
You might have silly thoughts that we're insane
But the city I'm from let me explain

In la there things you do not do
First of all home-boy don't mess wit da crew
You might have silly thoughts that we're too soft
But don't play it sweet or get took off

One two, it's time to get l

La Cal I forn ia(3x)
City of angels... Hollywood
We love it

I turned you on to the best females in the world
I wish they all could be california girls
Like the east where you girls where too many coats
Bring your clothesie
Runny noiseie
With a sore throat

That the girls in the south I cannot bust
Because the girls are fly and down with us
In the valley not the alley
In pina not valley
Eazy-e that's me
Always chip and fally

Hollywood's a bit of beef
Where the scene is raw
Oh yeah the strip is a trip on
South crenshaw
Don't get me wrong I like to brag on the city I own
Boy you walk do what?
Don't walk alone

Because
In la there things you do not do
First of all home-boy don't mess with the crew
You might have silly thoughts that we're too soft
But don't play it sweet or get took off

La is the place

Build with the brother who build old school

Ge'll ge'll lill stuff of that beat box (get get
Get a little stuff of that beat box)

West coast style from la
Yes I get's mine, it's got to be that way
It's sunny california that's where I be
If you forgot I chill with e
In the west I stand that's where you fall
Fell it where a punk goes snatching it all
Rhyme by rhyme record by e
In the city of l
With a devil like me

She's contaminated where the boys are hard
And people like me don't perpetrate the fraud
You wanna mess around
You better get wise
We'll find your but
And cut you down to size

Because
In la there things you do not do
First of all home-boy don't mess with the crew
You might have silly thoughts that we're too soft
But don't play it sweet or get took off

La Cal I forn ia(3x)

In la there things you do not do
First of all home-boy don't mess with the crew
You might have silly thoughts that we're too soft
But don't play it sweet or get took off
