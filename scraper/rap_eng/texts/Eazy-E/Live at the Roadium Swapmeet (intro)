[Crackhead:] Ki-ki kick it dre

[Intro: Dr Dre]
Just in 1-2, 1-2
Right about now Eazy-E and Dr. Dre is in the motherfucking
Hoooooouuuuuuuuuuuse

[Verse 1: Eazy E]
Times are getting crazy
It's really hard to choose it
The Roadium's about to get funky fresh music
Eazy muthaphuckkin E and my homeboy Dr. Dre
MC Ren is in effect and you know we don't play
The Roadium is hitting but you know you can't leave
Until you get a def ass tape from Steve
Oh Steve Oh Steve Oh Steve
Just gimme just one more tape
Oh Steve Oh Steve Oh Steve
Just gimme just one more tape
Oh Steve Oh Steve Oh Steve (Dre, Dre scratch)
Just gimme just one more tape (Dre, Dre scratch)
Oh Steve Oh Steve Oh Steve
Just gimme just one more tape
