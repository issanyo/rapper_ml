[Intro: Unknown News Reporter]
Rapper Eazy-E has full-blown AIDS, according to a written statement released on Thursday. Eazy-E, whose real name is Eric Wright, was a founding member of the multi-million selling rap group N.W.A.  He's currently in a critical condition in the intensive care ward of a Los Angeles hospital. The 31-year-old rapper had complained breathing problems but had no idea that he had AIDS before he was diagnosed, 3 weeks ago

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
Back to the set as I jet, not giving a (damn) about the (fool) that I wet
That's what he gotta shout for acting like a trick
Now he's 6 feet deep and I'm deep in his (trick)
Creepin' creepin' creepin' on the marks that be sleepin'
Catch you slippin' slap the clip in, buck 'em every weekend
A scandalous lil' (villain) wit no heart to feel remorse
(DIg up the fool's corpse), leave it on his momma's porch
Don't give a (damn) about shit, that's why I'm mellow
Or maybe it's the fact that I'm into the devil
A psychopathic (thriller), that's always quick to fill a
(fool) for a lick cause I'm a sick-ass killer
Thrilla from Manilla though I'm shorter than the average
Try to test your luck and get bucked by a (downright savage)

[Hook: Eazy-E]
Back to the set as I jet, (damn) about the (fool) that I wet (X4)

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
Later on that night as I'm rollin'
Looking for a (sucker) I can gat and pack a hole in
Stoppin' at a light in the late night
Fire up a Philly Blunt to get my head right
See some (tricks) slippin' at a burger stand
And in my mind all I'm thinking is a murder plan
Creepin' through the drive-through kinda slow
I got my high beams on the back of the '4, yo
Smokin' on chronic with the rag down
Not knowin' I'm about to lay their ass down
Reach for who was fool, made my move
Leaned out my jeep and I creep kinda smooth
With the gat to the [?] dome now he sleeps
One shot to the top body flopped on the seat, peep
I dumped on the lil' skinny passenger
(the trick) is screamin' in a rage, so I blasted her
Smashed and I got about 5 blocks
Before I got stopped by punk ass cops

Policeman: hey, step out of the car

[laughter & whispering]

(Break it down, baby)

Back to the set as I jet, (damn) about the (fool) that I wet (X10)
