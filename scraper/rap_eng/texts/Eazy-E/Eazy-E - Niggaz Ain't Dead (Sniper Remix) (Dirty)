[Eazy-E]
Now everythings good in my hood
And its on and poppin' Eazy-Muthaphukkin-E
From East Side South Compton
Str8 givin' up the real
On how a nigga feel talk that shit
Muthaphukkaz caps get peeled
Layin' low in the cut
Gettin higher than a muthaphuka niggas knows whats up
I'm that gangsta, gangsta is that what there still yellin'
Nigga G to a T saggin' and bailin'
Live by the gun you know what I'm sayin' Ren
"Yea"
So I guess I'll die by that muthaphukka then
So when I die niggas bury me
Make sure my shit reads Eazy-Muthaphukkin-E
And it's a fact to be exact my tombstone should read:
He Put Compton On That Map
And thats how a nigga feel
When I'm givin' up Tha Muthaphukkin Real

[Chorus]

[MC Ren]
They say real niggas was dead but this nigga be alive

Eazy muthaphukkin E, muthaphukkin god father of gangsta rap
[MC Ren]
They say real niggas was dead but this nigga be alive
[Eazy-E]
Well I'm Eazy-E I got woman galore (x2)

[M.C. Ren]
Well it be the real niggas back
With that hard street shit
Bitch niggas be pissin a fit
But I say fuck 'em, when I buck 'em
Its that nigga with the cool and mellow shit
For your ass takin' niggas back through the past
All up on my nutz shit be swingin' like a fist
Can't even take a piss
If I did niggas would cut they wrist
In a muthaphukkin candy 4
Beat that ass with the switch
Then blast on the bitch
Who was all in my shit
Its that nigga Ren back for the 9-5
They say real niggas was dead
But this nigga be alive
So I'm puttin' it down wit that nigga E uh-huh
For all of my niggas in the C-P-T
So here we go again with part 3 of the script
Makin bitch made niggas bite they lip, when we dip
So tell me how the phuck do it feel
Tah get hit wit Tha Muthaphukkin Real

[Chorus]

[MC Ren]
They say real niggas was dead but this nigga be alive

Well I'm Eazy-E I got woman galore (x2)
