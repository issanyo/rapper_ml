Ayo Ren lets do this
We want Eazy!

[MC Ren]
People from everywhere gather around
Checkin' out the sound that Eazy is throwin' down
With some help from Ren and Dre
Makin' a way with dope style
Yo Eazy, what ya gotta say

[Verse 1: Eazy-E + Dr. Dre]
A miracle of modern creation
Eazy E's on the set, hyped up with the bass
And a little bit of what ya love
From a brother who's smooth like a criminal
I mean subliminal - Otherwise known as a villain
Because I'm ruthless, when I spot a sucka, I kill 'em
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see

(Eazy!)
Everybody, come on!
(Eazy!)
A little louder say it!
(Eazy!)
Come on, say it, say it, say it!
(Eazy!)
Come on, everybody, come on!
(Eazy!)
Who'd y'all come to see?
(Eazy!)
A little louder, come on, say it!
(Eazy!)
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
(We want Eazy!)
Ayo Yella boy, take me to the bridge

[Bridge: Dr.Dre]
(Get funky with it)
(Get funky with it)
(Get funky with it)
(Get funky with it)

(Eazy!)
Everybody in the house!
(Eazy!)
Come on, say Eazy, Come on!
(Eazy!)
Come on, say it, say it, say it!
(We want Eazy!)
Ayo Eazy, kick me another verse

[Verse 2: Eazy-E + Dr. Dre]
Yeah 'cuz this is the way I know you like it
So you won't strike it
I took it and I hyped it
And now that it's done, I know ya pleased
At how the E just duz it with ease
Just imagine a crowd screamin', a girl dreamin'
Just to get a picture of me 'n' my B-O-Y-Z
From the H-double-O-D
N.W.A., down with me
Strong 'n' I'm ragin'
Turn the page 'n'
See I'm not a son of a gun
I'm a gauge 'n'
Nuthin' can avoid this shot cause it's hittin'
It's so cool when you touch it, wear a mitten
I'm comin' off raw into ya speaker
Makin' the suckas on the street feel weaker
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see

(Eazy!)
Everybody come on!
(Eazy!)
Get those hands back in the air!
(Eazy!)
Come on, say it, say it, say it
(Eazy!)
Come on, everybody, come on!
(Eazy!)
I can't hear you
(Eazy!)
A little louder, come on, say it!
(Eazy!)
Come on, say it, say it, say it
(Eazy!)
Ayo Yella boy, you know what time it is

[Bridge: Eazy-E + Dr. Dre]
(Eazy, hey Eazy!)
Wassup?
(Why do you wear your pants like that?)
I wear my pants like this for easy access, baby
Yeah, that's right
(Ey homeboy, where we taking this jam to?)
(COMPTON)
(Where?)
(COMPTON)
(Aw yeah)
Now I wanna know who ya came to see

(Eazy!)
Ayo, this record's almost over
(Eazy!)
...so that means y'all gotta get hyped up!
(Eazy!)
Come on, say it, say it, say it!
(Eazy!)
Do it, do it, do it, do it!
(Eazy!)
Everybody in the house!
(Eazy!)
Come on, say Eazy, come on!
(Eazy!)
Ayo, who y'all want?
(We want Eazy!)
Ayo Ren, let's kick another verse

[MC Ren & Dr. Dre]
Ren and Dre, the Villian and the Doctor together
Yo we can rock by ourselves, but we're together whenever
A funky track is included, it's getting better, not worse
Especially when Eazy's here to kick another verse

[Verse 3]
Aw, never, I'm just too clever
So, in fact, that no one can sever
A blow from a maniac and yo, I make it clear
So a register is all I hear
Money overturned, then I jet
To make another hit, for you to go and get
Record stores sold out because you love it
Another example of how Eazy duz it

[Bridge: Eazy-E + Dr.Dre]
(Eazy!)
Ha ha ha ha!
Who y'all want?
(We want Eazy!)
Aw yeah
(Eazy!)
All of me
Why not take all of me?
(We want Eazy!)
Who'd y'all come to see
(Eazy!)
Yeah
Yeah
(We want Eazy!)
Can I get down one time?
(Eazy!)
Yeah, you know what time it is
(We want Eazy!)
Yo stag, give me a funky solo homeboy

(Eazy!)
(We want Eazy!)
(Get funky with it)
(Eazy!)
(We want Eazy!)
(Get funky with it)
(Eazy!)
All of me
Why not take all of me?
(We want Eazy!)
(Get funky with it)
(Eazy!)
(We want Eazy!)
Turn this mother out!
(Eazy!)
(We want Eazy!)
(Get funky with it)
(Eazy!)
(We want Eazy!)
(Get funky with it)
(Eazy!)
All of me
Why not take all of me?
(We want Eazy!)
(Get funky with it)
(Eazy!)
(We want Eazy!)
Alright
Have a break right here
(Eazy!)
(We want Eazy!)
Check this out
(Eazy!)
*scatting*
(We want Eazy!)
(Eazy!)
Yo we just dropped a bomb on you
(We want Eazy!)
Check it out
(Eazy!)
(We want Eazy!)

[Verse 4]
Said it before, a miracle, a lyrical, and ever
Something that suckers can never sever
Sit for a second and check what jockeys are brazing
Pure dope, figure it out like amazing
Come to grips with the fact, Eazy-E ain't a lightweight
Nervous never, you could get broke with your brake
So if you're smart, take me from the start
The boyz 'n the hood are always hard
Time for a show, the stage I hit, and it's legit
'Cuz the crowd be like tripping and the girls be having a fit
It's like a riot, someone said I'm at the high
Everybody wants to scream and I try to get 'em quiet
To continue, never the less, they're on a mission to perditious
And to be in company with my permission
Exceptional, speaking of the E in Eazy-E
I gotta hear it, tell 'em who you came to see

(Eazy!)
(We want Eazy!)
