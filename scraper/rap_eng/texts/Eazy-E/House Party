[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
It's 1:45 in the morning
Everything's all good in the hood but it gets boring
Now I creeps around to the backdo'
Mom's done locked so I bails out the window
Aw home, street home
And there's a house party down the street
It's going on
I bails through the door
And guess who did I see?
Chan Loc, Sylk, Diamond and T-Ski
And it's all goin' down like this you know
Eazy-E, C-P-T
Go on Sylk, flow....

[Verse 2: Sylk-E. Fyne]
Well, it's the S, the Y, the L, the K
Now come on little closer and get played
Straight bombin'
Puttin' it down with that little fool from Compton
South Central definitely G.B.M for life
So pay the price
Life's too short, so I gamble
Don't give a damn so
I grabs the ammo
Smoke up that indo n' gotta make that money gotta make that
To build the stash
Ain't here to play
Ain't here to stay
But I'm here to put it down the ruthless way
Make my papers with my folks
They ??? with my locs
Much love to them girls, much love

[Verse 3: T-Ski]
T-Ski, Loc didn't you know that I
(...???...)
Talkin' behind yo back but won't say it to your face
I gotta break;
Get bizzy go Chan, get bizzy

[Verse 3: Chan Loc]
Have you ever seen her
That mad bitch that they call Chan
24/7 with the Glock in my hand
Now god damn
I'm ??? up the cental strips
Comin' in the chevy
Hopin' with the heat
Deep, rolling as we mobb to the beach
I got the silver gat and the great ????
