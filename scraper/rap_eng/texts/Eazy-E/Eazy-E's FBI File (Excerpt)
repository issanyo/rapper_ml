[Redacted] claims that he has put all evidence in this matter in storage in Canada and during conversation with [redacted]. In addition, [redacted] states that he can't come back to Los Angeles because he [redacted]. He also claims that [redacted].

The following investigation needs to be conducted:

If the attorney will not provide it, ask [redacted] to research any of his records to obtain the number. Then subpoena her records to see if there are telephone calls to the business or pager number in Canada. Remember that she allegedly called him only once to find out who he was. (See FD-302 for [redacted].

6. [Redacted] has agreed to take a polygraph regarding this matter. Consider using it to rule him out which would leave [redacted] as the only other person with access to those masters.

7. Contact [redacted] and request a meeting with [redacted] and the accountants to determine if their audit has uncovered embezzlement of funds from RR as alleged by [redacted]

8. Read FD-302 of [redacted] and determine if anyone should be interviewed regarding meetings between [redacted] and others at which they discuss being in possession of masters or DATS (high quality tapes) of EAZY-E's and want to put out an album.

Sometime in 1991 he received a phone call from [redacted] of RR who said he needed help because some of the [redacted] were threatening to kill WRIGHT and [redacted] if [redacted] didn't release the other NWA members from their contracts.

When [redacted] called [redacted] to consult with him on a course of action [redacted] told [redacted] to call the police.

[Redacted] didn't want to lose his artists. [Redacted] provided bodyguards to protect [redacted] and WRIGHT and brought in attorneys to help settle the business disputes.

[Redacted]. Since WRIGHT's death [redacted] has not been allowed to enter RR.

[Redacted] was asked to provide information regarding a man named [redacted] who is allegedly in possession of two brief cases which contain master recordings of WRIGHT and which belong to RR.
