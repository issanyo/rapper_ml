[Intro]
You give them recognition they're looking for
They win
Ignore them
You win
But when you say ignore them
I get goosebumbs I get a shiver
Jazz an' (scratched)
Just a minute

[Verse 1: Benyad]
Stabbed by the steeple
Scalpeled by the chapel
The choir's got my tongue
And the preacher's got my adams apple
All choked out against the confession stand
I told you once before I'm definitely not the motherfucking man
There is a plan
Cause you got no seasoning in you reasoning
Got a lot of heart so you know you can't appease me
Spiritual police you see
So get the shackles of my back cause I ain't with that


[Chorus] (x2)
Stabbed by the steeple
Scalpeled by the chapel
The choir's got my tongue
And the preacher's got my Adam's apple

[Verse 2]

[Mazik]
So much infomation in my head I'm gonna explode
When I speak upon the truth
I feel like I just dropped a load
I got do it off and gotta be careful
The right hand sun is coming gotta be careful
I got a blood line running thicker
Than the tar pits called labrea
When I went to visit apack? at lunch
I had a hunch it's gonna be a long while
For we get a chance to see 'em
We even got jews at the museum
So along the bus load of people
That I came with
That came to visit the hieroglyphic
Let's be specific why I came upon this journey
I don't even know pappy
Open up the atlas an I looked upon the map, see

[Benyad]
I'm so disgraced they try to deface
My beautiful people of ethiopia
More fruitful than a cornucopia
Make 'em cross through the main stream
Not talk about the culture
But a Christian man's dream
So it seems when the times ain't so good
Missionaries come I tell ya knock on wood
Now should you do it
Or should you shan't
I think I can't
Do you really care about your well being
Cause am not seeing compassion in ya action of relief
Food and shelter for exchange in belief
Like a loaded thief
Stratergy's kinda swell
Convert ones that hurting and aren't living well
But time will tell

[Chorus] (x2)
Stabbed by the steeple
Scalpeled by the chapel
The choir's got my tongue
And the preacher's got my Adam's apple

[Bridge]
But what you say ignore them
I get goosebumbs i get a shiver
Theres a lot more too it than that
But you get the idea
I get the idea


[Verse 4]

[Mazik]
Yo, I knew I wouldn't stop
When I saw the apple drop
It fell right on ya head
Ya been mislead it time to take it off an shed
Ya livin in denial
And no I don't mean Egypt
The bad ones come and go
But yo the good ones stay to visit
When they stay to visit I take 'em in
I treat 'em like a friend
And eat indeed I know the time
I know the date too
57-53 the year the be for me and you
The preacher tryin' tell me different
Saying it's 1993
I been around much much too long
To ever believe such fallacy
You get the point im trying to get at
You been hoodwinked you been had
Taken for a ride in the pope mobile
In the back seat they copped a feel for real

[Verse 5]
The other morning got a knock on my door
Suckas handing pamphlets
Like the saviour was a whore
Said thank for sharing
And thanks for caring
Ya girl you'll burn in hell
Is what they keep swearing
I only pray to one ghost
Not a home made cost
So pick up ya bag a bibles and take ya lossess
Cause am a lost cause
Ooweee
So handsome
Look like Charles Manson
Best believe am June Blossom's grandson
You take the high road
And I'll take the down low
And I'll be in Jerusalem before you know
And when I get there
And sit and prayer in the wailing wall
Cause the church is gonna motherfucking fall

[Chorus] (x2)

If you got into a fight with these people
And you'll lose we all lose
Due to the christ killers
They try to destroy the Christian religion
Sure I'll buy that
