[Intro: Dr. Dre + MC Ren]
Yeah, right about now Compton's in the mothafucking house Yeah do it, do it, do it
N.W.A's in full effect
Hey yo Yella boy, kick me that funky-ass beat
Pump it up, pump it up
Yeah, who's in the mothafucking house right now?
Pump that shit up
Yeah, Compton's definetly in the house
Hey yo Ren, what we're gonna do?

[Verse 1: MC Ren & Dr. Dre + Eazy-E]
To the people over here
To the people over there
To the people, the people, the people, people, the people, the people, people
From everywhere watching the show
Paying top dollars because they know
When we're on the stage, we're in a mothafucking range
[R] So Dre
[D] What up?
[R] Why don't you get the 12 guage (yeah)
And show them how Eazy-Duz-It
So if you punks wanna make something of it
Step up, run up, get up, what's up suckers
You want some of this?
Then you're a stupid mothafucker
Kicking, like the kick from a kickdrum
Yella boy on the drum getting dumb
Programming - a beat that's hitting
And if you listen then you know we're not bullshitting

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Dope - like a pound or a key (yeah)
So shut the fuck up and listen to me
I make a killing - I got money to the ceiling (why's that?)
Cause I'm a mothafucking ruthless villain
MC Ren - stomping any fool in my way
With some help from my homeboy Dre

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Now my name is Dre - the mothafucking doctor
Ripping shit up (oh yeah) and here to rock ya
With some help from my homeboy E
The criminal of the ruthless posse
Fucking it up (word up) is what we do
The reputation of the N.W.A crew
Getting busy because we're cold stomping
And we're born and raised
(And we're born and raised)
And we're born and raised in Compton

[Verse 4: MC Ren & Dr. Dre]
[R] Speaking of Compton, it's making me sick (why?)
Everybody's talking that crazy shit
[D] Saying they were raised in the CPT
Just as I was, they try to be like me
[R & D] Popping that shit, get the fuck out my face
Knowing that they never even seen the place
Claiming my city is my city they claim
Muthafucka we're about to put some salt in your game

[Break: Dr. Dre (MC Ren)]
Yeah I'm tired of these mothafuckers running around town Talking about they're from Compton and shit
Trying to get on the bandwagon
(Yeah Dre, I know what you're saying man, but let's tell them who we're talking about)

[Verse 6: Dr. Dre & MC Ren]
What do you call a crew that can rap like that?
[R] Yo N.W.A call them muthafuckers wack
[D] Yeah you know what time it is, listen to why we call them wack
They got a wacky wack record with a wacky wack crew
[R] Yo what about the lyrics?
[D] That shit's wacky wack too
[R] With a fucked up style and a fucked up show
[D] Hey yo Ren, what about the scratching, is it def?
[R] Fuck no!
The mothafucking record is so mothafucking wack
The mothafucking cracka jack needs to step the fuck back

[Break: Dr. Dre (MC Ren)]
Do you want some of this? Hell no
Dre the mothafuckin' doctor
(Well for the record it's Ren and for the street it's Villain)
Dre the mothafuckin' doctor
(Well for the record it's Ren and for the street it's Villain)
Yella boy, why don't you kick me one of them funky-ass beats?
My boy, my boy, my boy Ice Cube
(Yo we got my homeboy Eazy E in the house)
Won't you tell 'em what your name is?

[Verse 7: MC Ren]
MC Ren is the mothafucking coroner
I'm getting rid of mothafucker as if they was a foreigner
Show no grief to pretend when I sin
A punch you can block it but I'm a still get in
This ain't a TKO in the first
But it's some shit from a nigga in black it's much worse
Than a beat from Tyson, cause Ren is not nice and
Your ass is better off just rollin' a dice and
Finding you a number for luck
Cause you'll need it when you see I don't give a fuck
My identity, and the shit is getting shown
Without a video I'm still getting on
I'm at a show then my picture is taking
One click of the flash and punk niggas are breaking
To the door, trying to join my fan club
Lip-syncing over one of my dubs
The instrumental will scratch for the moment
Until I fuck up the so called opponent
That's standing in the zone of the twilight
Saying how in the fuck did he get mixed up in my fight
It wasn't a mistake, it was a set-up
So until I'm finished popping my lyrics you should shut up
And don't attempt to speak
Because it's bad enough you rolling up shit creek
With a nigga like Ren about the hit
Now let me hear you mothafuckers talk some more shit
I'm a bust your ass in your mouth
Yo, unless you're saying - "Compton's in the house"

[Verse 8: Dr. Dre]
Who realy cares - about a sucker on a take off
Bust a move, we can have a shake n' bake-off
Me and you can go cause I don't care yo
Rap fight or guerilla warfare
We can rumble, cause when my lungs go in and out
I kick rhymes in a bundle to win a bout
Or scurry or scuffle
I just muffle the opposition, there's no competition
Let them know that Dre is getting stronger
Compton's in the house but now it's some longer
I won't get set-up, shut up, I'm kinda fed up
You can say uncle and I still won't let up
Cause Dre is the mothafuckin' doctor
And if me and Ren's on the mike it's like propaganda, no doubt
(Boy you should've known by now) - Compton's in the house

[Outro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, it's time to put Compton on the map
Don't ever think you can get it on, you stupid mothafuckas!
