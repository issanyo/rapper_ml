[CNN Anchor Don Lemon]
We need to say there’s some video that is out there that has been reported by other news organizations

[Michael Brown’s Mother (Lesley McSpadden)]
I’ve been here my whole life! I ain’t never had to go through nothin’ like this
Don’t none of y’all know me, but I don’t nothin’ to nobody
Anybody say so, they’re a liar
They’re a damn liar

[Man]
It’s somebody son, that was somebody’s child
Y’ALL MURDERDED HER FUCKING SON!

[Michael Brown’s Father]
BURN THIS BITCH DOWN! BURN THIS BITCH DOWN!

[Hook - K. Jayz]
I don’t know about y’all, but I’m really getting tired of the law
Cause even if you try to abide, they still wanna see you locked up in the doghouse
So I won’t care about the law until the law cares for me
Cause to them, they’ll see me as a threat long as I walk around chillin’ with the homies

[Verse - K. Jayz]
Better watch your back
You never know who the fuck gonna blast
It could be yo’ homie, or it could be the police that blast you in the back
Or the stomach or the face
Cause you just another race
Or maybe you fit the description of another nigga they tryna chase
But it still don’t matter, what is going on this country that stay living wrong?
Corrupt individuals in the government
A country for the people but police is runnin’ it
Bendin’ round corners, you would think they was thugs how they roll up on us
And they lock up a nigga smoking marijuana before they lock up a serial killer that’s upon us
Damn
Way too many people don’t know the truth
You might be innocent, but then you see the boys in blue
True, they not all the same, but it’s a good disguise for a criminal to fool you
The conflict ain’t about the race
They tryna divide us by making it seem that way
So what the hell you supposed to do?
You just gotta be ready whenever you see the fools
Act calmly, don’t look twice, it’s the one time
Sometimes I think hard about life
Like why the fuck we got stereotypes?
But a lot of times, they really right
We never wanna move forward, except for the generation that is older
We need unity
If we have that, there’ll be less eulogies

[Hook]

[Interlude - Eazy-E]
Cops put a hurtin' on your ass, man, you know, they really degrade you
White folks don't believe that shit, they don't believe that cops degrade you
[Imitating white person] Oh come on, those people, those people are resisting arrest

[Hook x2]
