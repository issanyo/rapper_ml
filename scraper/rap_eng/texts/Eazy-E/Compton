[Eazy-E; from the song "Switchez"]
1,2,3, and to the 4
Eazy muthafuckin' E
With the chrome to your dome
Cruisin' in my '64 rag top
I got a lot of juice
A lot of fuckin' block
Now when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
Keep the gat in my lap
'Cause I'm fully strapped
For the car jackers
But no haps, 'cause I pack a
Tech-9
Plus a AK-47
Send a one way ticket to my hell
Or maybe heaven, peep
Nigga I don't sleep
Bury muthafuckas in the concrete
They try to creep kinda slow in a Astro
But I peep you niggas out in my left window
So I blast and I blast 'til I blast no mo'
Yo, they call a muthafucka John Doe

[Hook]
Compton
Lotta good, lotta pain
But one thing you're never gon' change
And nigga that's (Compton)
So let this shit bang
And we don't give a fuck what you claim
'Cause nigga this (Compton)
Every night, every day, tell 'em this (Compton)
Better pray son don't make ya dat [?] (Compton)
Every night, every day, tell 'em this (Compton)
Better pray son don't make ya dat [?] (Compton)

C-O-M-P-T-O-N, had it wild in the streets
So let that shit begin
Caught my first fade in the third grade
Mama tried to best raised by the herb game
For reals, it's real
Them clips load up
Then the pigs show up
Homies yellin' out fuck cops like Chris Donut
Niggas get scared when the 'rus and Crips roll up
Hit the wrong block in the hood
And get rolled up, wait hold up
Throw up they set, we like "so what?"
You know why? These niggas be straight talkin'
Then they got fold up, so show us
If you 'bout that life
Fidda judge is givin' 50 you ain't 'bout that, right
Lost friends to the streets, got homies in penitentiaries
Been a real nigga since Caldwell Elementary
Really from this city, you other niggas pretend to be
So every time you mention Compton, nigga
Better mention me

[Hook]
Compton

Better pray son don't make ya dat [?] (Compton)

[AD]
Straight like that
This the town
I eat, breathe, sleep this Compton shit
No matter where you from
If you a real one, well I salute you
And only real ones gon' respect that (Compton)
It's Central down to Rosecrans
We gon' keep this shit poppin' like the OGs used to
R.I.P. E. (Compton)
Kendrick, YG, Problem, JB, Peso, G Hood, Hootie J, Three Fifth, this Compton
