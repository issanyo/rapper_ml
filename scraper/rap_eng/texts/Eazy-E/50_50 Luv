[Intro: B.G. Knocc Out, Dresta]
50/50 love
Yeah, for 199-motherfuckin'-5
50/50 love
Gangsta Dresta done stomped through the doors once again
50/50 love
Dedicating this one to all my niggas all across the land
50/50 love
We need a 50/50 love back in the hood, loc
Check this out

[Verse 1: Dresta]
I walked through the turf
Me and Smurf jibba-jabbing about the old days
Smokin' on a joint, listenin' to The O'Jays
Fucks up my mind to see how times changed
It's all kinda strange, ain't a damn thang the same
Back when it was all about packin' switchblade
Half of us down now is runnin' around bitch made
Didn't wanna fight brothers grown that was known
But now it's on, if one of the homies come at me wrong
Back then things was like hyped
Even if the homies fight, still kept the hood tight
Down with each other to the last bit
Now we got homies puttin' each others into caskets
Used to roll in Chevies, now niggas wanna Benzie
Money and dope done brought jealousy and envy
Niggas got greedy and the needy got left back
Now your own homie is the victim of your next jack
Serving nigga with the gat stuffed in your mouth
Used to sleep on your couch, spending nights at your house
And it's a damn shame that the hood ain't like it was
I'm talkin' about a 50/50 love

[Hook] (x2)
I ain't talkin' about 70/30 (A 50/50)
Not 60/40 (A 50/50)
I'm talkin' about 50/50 love, yeah

[Verse 2: Dresta]
The homies used to take us to the liquor store to steal beer
That was when my cousin Gugulo was still here
Buddy gave a party like almost every weekend
I've been tryna sneak in, tryna put my freak in
See how times changed, one of the sets we used to fight with
But that set now is one of the sets that we tight with
Time's still changin' cause brothers turnin' into snitches
Can't separate the real niggas from the bitches
Even in the jailhouse niggas being phony
You really don't know, who to treat like a homie
Back in the day we used to claim we was brothers
And cousins and shit and now we can't trust each other
Gotta watch my back not just 'cause a brother gaze for niggas that
Bang for the same thang that I claim
Homies locked down doing time in a chamber
We talking about 'em a lot but yet we treating 'em like a stranger
I recollect the days when I was back in like the 6th grade
Tucking about behind the O.G.'s. learning how the trick's played
Damn, a nigga really kinda miss how them days was, G
'Cause it was 50/50 love

[Hook] (x2)
I ain't talkin' about 70/30 (A 50/50)
Not 60/40 (A 50/50)
I'm talkin' about 50/50 love, yeah

[Verse 3: B.G, Knocc Out]
For the homies that's resting, I pour a little drink right
But how many others go visit them at their grave site
Forget the bullshit, pass the hats around the room homes
Let's go and visit the homies and put some flowers on their tomb stones, yeah
'Cause that's the least we can do, you know
Be in the hood that they died fo' and loved ones cried fo'
I missed 'em with a passion fo' what it's worth
I hope I meet 'em again when I leave from this earth
And we done lost many of 'em
And it's a shame that we let 'em go
Without letting 'em know we love 'em
But now I'ma let the homies rest in peace
And all the homies that's beefing with each other, loc, gotta cease
I can't speak about nobody else
Canâ€™t peace treat with nobody else
Until we be peace with ourselves
Homies ain't homies like they was
I really don't know who wants to fill me with slugs
Without the backstabbing everything would probably be fun
That's how it is in the hood that I come from
Damn, a nigga really kinda miss how them days was, cus'
'Cause it was 50/50 love

[Hook] (x3)
I ain't talkin' about 70/30 (A 50/50)
Not 60/40 (A 50/50)
I'm talkin' about 50/50 love, yeah
