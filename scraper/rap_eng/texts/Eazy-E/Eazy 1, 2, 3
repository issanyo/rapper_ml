[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
A typical street corner ass nigga
Once a nigga always a nigga now a public figure
But I can still serve a muthafucka if I have too cause I'm slanging them thangs nigga
I roll deep with a crew or a posse
Niggas cuttin' throat, Murder She Wrote for the Eazy-E, fool
Fuck with the veteran, still a better man than the next man, then again
I can still put a chrome nine to your dome
Boom nigga boom nigga no Milkbone
Yippie-yi-yay your ass back the fuck on home
Stay the fuck off the sherm and crack and "Just Say No"

[Verse 2: Phalos Mode]
My definition of a bitch nigga
Aww shit, get pistol whipped, need to sit down when he piss
Cause I beat em treat em fuck em like 1 2 3
The legend of gangster rap is Eazy-E
Still gangsta ruthless, leaving muthafucka's toothless
I was sign to sky before I do this. a nigga gone
I guess I see you at the crossroads, a nigga with an attitude, my name from last month

[Verse 3]
That's where the streets hits the radio
And give the love like he supposed to
Y'all don't wanna death in the studio
Another scandal for me and E to handle
Raised my 64 11 on the roll
Bang, Los Angeles slang
Like a double barrel, E point right in tha game
Big lotion ya ass see smoke glower
Now fucking with legends Eazy with a weapon
Cash is trading killer cross-over
Jump in the game, and bitches slanged my name
Violent reporter the streets out of order
Projects corner and gangster were 'fore us
I hit blocks of a double-shot
Show my face on the block I give a fuck about a cop
Male black attitude, nigga fuck you
Stomping niggas from South Central ? Compton

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
Now what the fuck is worse than 1 punk nigga?
2 punk niggas, add em up and get the picture
One's a fucking fag from the days and one's a busta
I was born a pimp, a mack daddy and a hustla
You can take the nigga off the streets but you can't take the streets out the nigga. Once a nigga still a nigga
Fucking hoes I do mean fucking steadily, I fucked your bitch (ahh) cause she was begging me
Your bitch ain't nothin' but a piece of cock to me
She dropped the drawers when she found out I was Eazy
She licked the balls and sucked the dick I came heavily
(ooh get me ready E, fuck me steadily)

[Verse 5: Phalos Mode]
Why these niggas sippin' Haterade
Drinking on bitch Kool-Aid
For the name of Easy niggas get sprayed
Now I'm in my lowrider and this candy-paint
Stash spot for the Glock
Nigga think I aim, I am with a five full of five gangsta was ?? big, paper drill, on the quest for mills
Now everybody say they are thugging
But when the gun blast see niggas running, I leave no witnesses

[Bridge]
Punk niggas always tryna hate and they be always talking shit
But when they sober they all hesitate cause they don't know who they fucking with
Long live real gangsta shit and tell your ho get off my dick
Cause we gone finish of the legacy and keep the family so legit
