[Intro: Red Spyda]
What we always do about this time
Nah stop, damn, whoo-ee

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
1, 2, 3, and to the 4
Eazy muthafuckin' E with the chrome to your dome
Cruisin' in my 6-4 rag top
I got a lot of juice, a lot of fuckin' block
Now when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce and I'm clownin'
Keep the gat in my lap 'cuz I'm fully strapped
For the car jackers, but no haps 'cuz I pack a
Tech 9, plus a A-K 47
Send a one way ticket to my hell or maybe heaven
Peep, nigga I don't sleep
Bury motherfuckas' in the concrete
You try to creep kind of slow in a Astro
But I peep you niggas out in my left window
So I blast and I blast 'till I blast no more
Yo, they call a motherfucker John Doe

[Chorus: Eazy-E]
Oh nigga E still cruisin', cruisin down the street in my 6-4
Oh nigga E still cruisin', cruisin down the street in my 6-4
Oh nigga E still cruisin', cruisin down the street in my 6-4
Oh nigga E still cruisin', cruisin down the street in my 6-4

[Verse 2: Game]
1, 2, 3, and to the 4
Pumps in the trunk of that cherry red 6-4
I'm ridin' with the ghost of Eazy, hop in the leany
He watchin' for demons, nigga if you try me
Then I'm cocking the nina, begging Lucifer to give me reason
To have a hundred thou' cash brought down to the precinct
I'mma make bail money this rap shit is a monopoly
And I got property, that's get out of jail money
Nigga I came from poverty, shootouts gangbanging and robberies
Car-jacking, snatch him out of his impala
Do that with or without the (gun cocking) on the side of me
Hop out the ride and empty the 4-5 into his body
I'm not to be fucked with, whether I'm straight outta' Compton
Or straight outta' Cashville on that Young Buck shit
Terrorizing Whookid 24/7
'Til one of you niggas put me with Eazy in heaven

[Chorus: Eazy-E]
Oh nigga E still cruisin', cruisin' down the street in my 6-4
Oh nigga E still cruisin', cruisin' down the street in my 6-4
Oh nigga E still cruisin', cruisin' down the street in my 6-4
Oh nigga E still cruisin', cruisin' down the street in my 6-4
