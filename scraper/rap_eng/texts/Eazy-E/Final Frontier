[Intro: DJ Bobcat]
Hey, hey Ren, hey check this out loc
Hey man I've been hearing a gang of niggas
Talking a whole lot of unnecessary bullshit man
What if one of them trick ass niggas
Come at you the wrong way, loc?

[Verse 1]
I'll beat a nigga's ass on this track just for the hell of it
There the motherfucking piece of pussy there's no tell of it
I don't give a damn I'll beat a nigga like he stole something
And then I'll let the motherfucker know where Ren is coming from
(Where you from, loc?)
I'm from Compton, everybody's on the wagon
I'm looking for niggas that's thinking
That they're the shit, that's who I'm tagging
Never asking questions I just go right in and do it
And if you're thinking that you can fuck with Ren
You bitch already blew it
Like I said before, fools want up in my shoes
But after fucking with me
They giving up rapping and singing the blues
Me and DJ Train dropping bombs like a B-2
So you should get the picture or if not, you get a preview
That we don't take no shit
Cause MC Ren ain't a nigga that you wanna try and fuck with
Kick a little ass in my spare time
To keep myself occupied when I'm not busting up a rhyme
Writing that shit that ya love to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier

[Hook]
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10

[Verse 2]
Now throw your hands in the air and let me see ya slap a ho
Start the violence going on through an MC Ren show
I don't give a fuck if niggas is fighting in the crowd
I only got one concern, that's my vocals pumping loud
I'm standing on the stage I got my niggas to my right
I bust a couple of verses
Then jump in the crowd and get with the fight
I hit a nigga off in the head with a chair
The reason for that, the motherfucker he was standing there
Then DJ Train will grab the gauge - just in case a motherfucker
Talks shit; he'll be the victim on the front page
He's on his way to the morgue - to kick it with the rest
Of them motherfuckers that I gave free room and board
So when you at my show
Let me see ya throw your hands up in the air and slap a ho
Cause that's the only noise I wanna hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier

[Hook]
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10

[Verse 3]
The final frontier makes the average nigga wonder
Why they do a couple of records and then they go up under
Try to copy Ren but Ren just can't be duplicated
Motherfuckers making pussy shit so I come in and fade it
Slap the niggas like bitches if they have to talk back
Put my foot so deep in their ass they have a hole and not a crack
The shit just makes a nigga laugh, cause niggas be coming to me
Asking me why did I leave size 10 Nike in their ass
I tell them I had to do it was part of the plan
To try to stop the fools jacking off by the hand
Putting wack records in the make
By using R&B fucking singers in the god damn breaks
Trying to go commercial but they started out street
That's reason why they're still drivin in their two feet
Thinking they can diss Ren's flow, but singing and dancing
Don't go with the format that I be using in my show
It's just hardcore niggas acting crazy on the stage
Wearing gangsta clothes yo and spitting on the hoes
Doing that shit that ya love to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier

[Hook]
