[Verse 1]
Aw yeah, let's take a trip
Just sit back and light a spliff to this and don't step
On a funky-ass track jump back
Strapped with a gat and a sack and a seven-eight lac
Come clean, gangsta lean, I got green
But I serve dubs like it ain't no thing
I hang with O.G. niggas, don't set trip
Or you might get a slug in your fuckin' back
I don't slack when it come to street
I kick real G shit to a gangsta beat
It's so sweet, when you got money to spend
I got a cool-ass tilt and a fly-ass Benz
I make ends, spend my dough on no ho
That's how it is and that's how it goes
Act like ya know when I creep real slow
Givin' love to them niggas that I know is real G's

[Hook: Shaki]
If you got love for dem gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime
("That's right, fool")
If you got love for dem hustlas
Let me hear you say hooo if you makin straight dough *hooooo*
If you got love for dem playas
Let me hear you say ooooh, ladies we want you *ooooooh*
If you got love for dem straight G's
Let me hear you motherfuckers just scream *heeeeeeey*

[Sample]
The ruthless network, drive-by expert
Straight outta Compton, kickin' up dust
The ruthless network, drive-by expert
Straight outta Compton

[Verse 2]
Dump, dump on a nigga with a quickness
And they got no cure for this sickness
I get paid for the way that I kick this
Like a G-sta, an O.G.-sta
("Who's that?")
A real nigga named Eazy
And I live my life straight crazy
Don't need no punk niggas payin' me
And broke groupie-ass bitches don't faze me
I take two step back and release myself
To put platinum-ass cuts on the record shelf
I don't brag but I tell it like it straight up is
Before you do a record, nigga, handle your business
And don't get caught slippin' on the under
Or you might wonder
(What's up on dem ends, nigga?)
I call a spade, a spade and get paid
G's show the way, so I give love to 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
E-A-Z - why must I
Chase the cat and be a dog, a straight-up hog
I leapfrog to the sound of a gangsta beat
So I can hear my shit bumpin' on a Compton street
That O.G., C-R-I-P and S, G and S
Hip-Hop thugsta, so quick to rush ya
Straight to the dirt, fool I do work
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
That's how it is when it come to me
Cause I'm the long dick bust-a-nut nigga named Eazy
Bitches can't see me, hoes say I'm crazy
But I don't think so, cause I'm just loco
I gives a fuck about a skankless bitch
Let me hit it one time if you suck this dick
I don't trip, gives my dough to no ho
That's how it is, but I gives love to ya

[Hook]
