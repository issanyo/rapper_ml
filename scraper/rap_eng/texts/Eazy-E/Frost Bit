[Verse 1]
Haha, yeah
Now everybody meet Ronnie (Who?)
A young black suburbanite
Who was with the whites since he learned to read and write
He's only 10 and pretends to fit in
Because them little white homies
Got him thinking he's as white as them
He has a pops who owns stock's in Xerox
Pops only problem was the bourbon and peach schnapps
(A drunk?) An alcoholic
He didn't heed the early warning
That his kids were being frost bit
He had a sister fat as hell, you couldn't miss her
Only black girl in the school, so everybody used to diss her
But back to little Ronnie
Ron, he made a 100 bucks a week
Mowing all the neighbors lawns
But guess what he saved that money for fellas (What?)
To buy a surfboard to make the white friends jealous
And that's exactly what he did
Catching waves was the trends
So he did it for the white kids
Benefit and now he's in some shit
Cause he's at Venice Beach and can't surf a damn lick
Head crack, head crack
Kept falling on that ass
So he took that board back
Now what do we have here
He gave up the surfing but still sports the surfing gear
Everyday not just a little bit
Cause little Ronnie is on his way to being...

[Hook] (x2)
Frost bit, frost bit
Once you go black you never go back

[Verse 2]
Verse two little Ronnie, little older, little wiser
All into Rock 'n' Roll so he buy's a synthesizer
Can't stand rap jam's, thinks it sounds like Max Headroom
Got a gang of heavy metal poster taped up on his bedroom
He's at the age, where his peers think he's strange
Cause he comes to junior high in black leathers and chains
Not to mention that he's black (Go Ronnie)
And can't dance (Go Ronnie; Go Ronnie)
In the motorcycle boots and parachute pants
(Go Ronnie; Go Ronnie)
But everyday before school he stops by the local arco
To steal a candy bar and buying a fresh pack of Marlboro's
And he can smoke between class cause he's a rebel
Hanging with some white kids that worship the devil
He quit sports in one week
Because his coach when out like a Jimmy the Greek
Thinking just because he's black
He probably runs like a god
But hell he proved that
He was the slowest kid on the squad
And it's a messed up scene
When a young black kid gets caught in the in between
Cause out there they could look down upon
And in the ghetto they're automatic Uncle Toms
So how could little Ronnie ever be legit
After 14 and half years of being frost bit

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
'Twas the night before Christmas
And all through the house
Ronnie's family packing boxes
Cause they got to get the hell out
Pops is a drunk, now they got to face facts
First he lost his job and then a grip at the race track
And little Ronnie can't stand it
Moving to the ghetto is like moving to a different planet
He seen things he never seen before
Two people died in a shootout at a liquor store
And he ain't accepted
In a school he's a sell out
So they beat the hell out
Off his ass one day
Cause you can't be soft and be in high school in L.A
And that's all he could take
He went straight to the pawn shop
And bought himself a .38
And a fifth of Jack Daniel's
Went home to his room
Killed the lights and lit a couple candles
And made his stereo blast
A heavy metal tune while he's crying
Thinking about the past
And it's sad it has to end this way
But little Ronnie didn't show up for school the next day
And personally I can't take that shit
When a life goes down the drain for being frost bit

[Hook]

[Outro]
