Sing me a sad song
And I'll be right on my way
A sad song like the songs of yesterday
Well my father used to sing the blues
Sometimes it was good
But my mother never saw the use
And she chased him for his blood
A sad song like the songs of yesterday
A sad song
And I'll be right on my way

Oh you know my father
Always used to say
A bad workman blames his tools
But it seems to me
A man who uses the tools
Is just a fool

Sad song
And I'll be right on my way

Sad song
Like the songs of yesterday

Well now the streets are filled with silent cars
And all the world's a stage
But I must get to work today
Today I get my wage

Sad song
Then I'll get on
On my way
Just like a song of yesterday
Listen to what I'm gonna say
