They call me the hunter
'cause thats my name
Pretty little woman like you
Is my only game

I bought me a love gun
Just the other day
And I aim to aim it your way
Ain't no use to hide
Ain't no used to run
'cause I got you in the sight
Of my girly gun

The first time I saw you
Standing on the street
I said to myself
Oh! ain't she sweet

I got my love gun loaded
With hundreds of kisses
Soon as I pull the trigger baby
There will be no misses

Ain't no use to hide
Ain't no use to run
'cause I got you in the sight
Of my girly gun

Ain't no use to hide
Ain't no use to run
'cause I got you in the sight
Of my girly gun

The first time I saw you
Standing on the street
I said to myself
Oh! ain't she sweet

I got my love gun loaded
With hundreds of kisses
Soon as I pull the trigger baby
There will be no misses

Ain't no use to hide
Ain't no use to run
'cause I got you in the sight
Of my girly gun
