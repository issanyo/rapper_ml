You say you needed someone
But you just needed somewhere to stay
Oh, any other time
Any other time
I'd have told you to be right on your way

You say you needed a friend
But you just needed sympathy
Oh, any other time
Any other time
I'd have told you just to let me be
But I was so alone
So alone

CHORUS
Don't say you love me, Baby
Don't say you love me
Don't say you love me
Cause I know it would be just a lie

I lost the warmth in my life
And you came and helped me up
When I was down
Oh, any other time
Any other time
I'd have let you carry on
Fooling around

I let you into my home
And I even let you into my heart
Oh, but any other time
Any other time
I'd have let you carry on
From the very start
But I was so sad and blue
And I just didn't know what to do

CHORUS

Time, has told me what I need to know
Time, has showed me now what love is for
Time, keeps telling me that I've got to go

Yeah I needed someone
But that time's gone
Now, Baby I'm gonna try and do it
All on my own

CHORUS (x 2)

Baby
I don't want you to tell me that you love me
Because I know, because I know
Yes I know, yes I know
That it would be just a lie
