Travellin' man goes anywhere
I don't stay nowhere long
Travellin' man don't turn your back
Before you know I'm gone

Don't ask me where have I been
Or if I'm staying long
'cos till I find a love that's real
I'm gonna keep on travelin' on

Travellin' man is what I am
I don't stay nowhere long
Travellin' man don't turn your back
Before you know I'm gone

Hey Baby, now jump aboard
And help me to sing this song
Don't worry 'bout the boys and me
Ain't gonna do you no wrong

Travellin' man that's what I am
I don't stay nowhere long
Travellin' man don't turn your back
Before you know I'm gone

Travellin' man goes anywhere
I don't stay nowhere long
Travellin' man don't turn your back
Before you know I'm gone

Travellin' man that's what I am
I don't stay nowhere long
Travellin' man don't turn your back
Before you know ......I'm gone
