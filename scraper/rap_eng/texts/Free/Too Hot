[Intro: Free]
It's just too hot
It gets too hot, baby
It's just too hot
It gets too hot, baby

[Verse 1: Keith Sweat]
At 17, we fell in love
High school sweethearts, the love was so brand new
Took the vows of man and wife
Forever, for life
I remember how we made our way
A little patience, the time we pray
Can't imagine that this love is through
Feeling up ain't new when you lose

[Chorus: Keith Sweat & Free]
It's just too hot
It gets too hot, baby
It's just too hot
It gets too hot, baby
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's just too hot
It gets too hot, lady
It's just too hot
It gets too hot, baby
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta go for the love that we made

[Verse 2: Free]
It's hard to express myself so I'ma put this in a verse
And in this world of emotions, there ain't nothin' worse
Than lovin' somebody and hatin' them at the same time
And even after all the bull, they come in with the same line
You better be on your guard, yo, get this ish right
No, we ain't givin' em for nothin', and not just for one night
And this was goin' out to all my dimes, throw 'em up
And if you y'all feelin' free lyrically, then we keep 'em up

[Verse 3: Keith Sweat]
Thank God we never took the time to stop, and feel the need
Honey, as the years go by, changing you, changing me

[Chorus: Keith Sweat & Free]
It's just too hot
It gets too hot, baby
It's just too hot
It gets too hot, baby
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's just too hot
It gets too hot, lady
It's just too hot
It gets too hot, baby
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta go for the love that we made

[Verse 4: Jermaine Dupri]
I used to be the biggest player in town, at least I thought I was
All I know was how to get around and how to fall in love
Kept me from never gettin' somethin' steady
But just in case, it ever took place, I had somethin' ready
You know the type ain't good with mom, ride in the hood, huh
You try to overlook but know she the one
I know she the one, that showed me the fun
Give me the good feelin' and know how I like it done
I feet myself fallin', but then I'm still ballin'
I love her, but then again, I think I love 'em all and
I'm kinda mixed up in the 6 doin' the bub'
Tryna decide if I should give it up
And let go of my trickery world
Talkin' 'bout becomin' a one-girl man from here on out
I want to, yeah, honestly I do
But I know I'm not 'cause temptation is just too hot, it's true

[Chorus: Keith Sweat & Free]
Oh, our love is too hot
Much too hot, baby
I'll never forget you, baby
Oh, our love is too hot
Much too hot, baby
I'll never forget you, baby
Sorry it didn't work out
Oh, our love is too hot
Much too hot, baby
Sorry it didn't work out
See we took our vows
Oh, our love is too hot
Much too hot, baby
Of man of wive
Said we'd be together for the rest of our lives
It's just too hot
It gets too hot, baby
It's just too hot
It gets too hot, baby
