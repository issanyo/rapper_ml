VERSE 1
Take off your hat, kick off your shoes
I know you ain't going anywhere
Run round the town singing your blues
I know you ain't going anywhere

CHORUS 1
You've always been a good friend of mine
But you're always saying farewell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well

VERSE 2
Throw down your gun, you might shoot yourself
Or is that what you're trying to do?
Put up a fight you believe to be right
And someday the sun will shine through

CHORUS 2
You've always got something to hide
Something you just can't tell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well

MIDDLE EIGHT
And I know what you're wishing for
Love and a peaceful world
Love and a peaceful world
Love and a peaceful world
Love and a peaceful world

CHORUS 1

I wish you well
The wishing well
Everybody has a wish
Everybody has a dream
I wish you well
You have to dream your own dream
