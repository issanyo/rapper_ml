Morning comes
And the evening follows
Life without you
Knows no tomorrow
You leave me weary
And you leave me tired
But you fill my soul
With strange desire
But I love you babe
Yes I love all of you

Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah! Ah! Yeah

Why don't you feel me
I'll watch your eyes
Gaze into space
Oh! let the sign of love
Go not on your face
You drain my strength
And you run me down
Mm..you got me crawlin'
Crawlin' on the ground
Oh but I love you babe
Oh yeah I love love love you babe

Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah! Ah! Yeah

Why don't you free me
