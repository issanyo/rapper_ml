[Zettabyte]

I had this one girl
She said this one thing
And when I found out
It was so funny
She didn't care about the fame
Or the money
So at Chengdu Delight
I had to dump Ling

[Free]

Aye
Sucky sucky fucky fucky
Five dollar footlong
I beat that pussy up and have
That bitch singing the swan song
I met that bitch in Texas
But she say that she from Hong Kong
I sent that bitch a message
Told her come and eat this wonton

[kst]

Come and get this wonton
Yeah shake it like a pom pom
Give yo ass a segro
Hentai be my fave, yo
Smoking dope
Eyes chicky
Spraying sticky on those titties
Let me sippy miso soup
The way she drippy drippy drippy

[Bridge: Zettabyte]

Yeah she a freak
With a whole lotta cash
Man I gotta get a hand
Up in her stash
While I play that .Paak
And I ride those Waves
Lookin' for the cat
With the Milk N' Honey every day
And I Might Be
Off the Ground in The City
Right There Already
On the Drugs
Yeah, yeah Get Em Up

Don't tell me that I won't flex
Imma break you off until you shout
Because I'm ruthless

And she quick witted
All I can say is she a Gemini

With that strap
Back to the trap
