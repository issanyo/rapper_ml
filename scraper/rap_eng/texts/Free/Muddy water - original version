I was born on the muddy water
I didn't know right from wrong
My mom she said look here son
I was born on the muddy water
I didn't know right from wrong
My mom she said look here son
I'll show you how it's done
Take you a woman and treat her right
She'll be by your side night and day
The first time you deceive her
You've broken her spell
Then I had bad luck
Like a fool I fell where I stood
I was walking in the rain with my shoes untied
Tryin' to find a dry place to hide
To hide

But I'd rather sleep that say a word
I don't believe a word that's heard
The first time I deceived you
I held it inside
Take you a woman and treat her right
She'll be by your side night and day
The first time you deceive her
You've broken her spell
I held it inside
Like a fool I smiled on my pride
I was walking in the rain with my shoes untied
Tryin' to find a dry place to hide
To hide

I was walking in the rain with my shoes untied
Tryin' to find a dry place to hide
To hide

I was walking in the rain
