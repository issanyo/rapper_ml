I work hard everyday
Come rain or shine
And I don't need no one
To tell me 'bout a girl of mine
She's got so much love
And she saves it all for me
I would not be lying
That's the way it's got to be

So Mr. Big
You'd better watch out
When only you hang around me
Oh for you now
I will dig
A great big hole in the ground

I don't care who you are
So don't explain
Just get out of here
And don't come back again
I don't want a thing from you
I don't want to give you nothing too
Get out of here
Before I lose my cool

Mr. Big
Oh watch out
Baby and don't you hang around me
Oh for you now
I will dig
A great big hole in the ground

So Mr. Big
You'd better watch out
When only you hang around me
Oh for you now
I will dig
A great big hole in the ground
