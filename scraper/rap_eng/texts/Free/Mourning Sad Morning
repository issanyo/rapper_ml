Sunday morning I rise
And I stand to face a new dawn
Sunday morning
Anew day is born

Such a long way to go
And so little time to get there
Such a long way to go

Well I want you to remember
All the love we used to know
Think of me
Sometimes, my love

Mourning, morning, sad day
Mourning morning, sad day

In the evening I sit
And my thoughts they turn to you
In the evening I think of
My home

And I need you to remember
All the love we used to know
Think of me sometimes
My love

Mourning morning, sad day
Mourning morning, sad day
