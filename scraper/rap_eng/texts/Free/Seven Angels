If you see me flyin'
All across the sky
There I go, I'm flyin' high

Six white horses
A chariot made of gold
Seven lovely angels
Abide my soul

I've got the moon on my right
The sun on my left
The world is behind me
Only one way to go
That's straight ahead
That's where I'm going

Well I've just stepped out
Out of my grave
There I go, I ain't no slave
In my right hand
Is the sword of truth
In my left hand
Is the fire of love
I call to the land
I call to the sea
I call to the sky
Lord have mercy
Won't you hear me

As I look behind me
What do I see
A pair of golden wings
Seems to be attached to me

Wings on my back, I've got to fly away
I just can't wait till tomorrow
I've got to fly away
There I go
