Watch my hand
Writing this last letter
Watch my hand
Knowing I won't forget her
No I won't forget her

Take my things
Every thing is over
All my things
Leave behind my love
Leave behind my love

Now lighing a cigarette
Now knowing I will regret
The way our love had to end
In her room
Standing all alone
All alone, soon I will be gone

Soon I will
Soon I will
Soon I will be gone
Soon I will
Soon I will
Soon I will be gone
