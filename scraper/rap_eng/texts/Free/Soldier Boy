I'm a soldier boy
Standing on the battlefield
And I hear the bugle call
Calling me to my destiny
All around me is people falling down

I'm a soldier boy
Standing on the battlefield
Oh! The sky is red overhead
Burns my eyes like a fireball
All around me is people falling down

I'm a soldier boy
Standing on the battlefield

Standing on the battlefield
