Sunday morning I rise
And I stand to face a new dawn
Sunday morning a new day is born

Such a long way to go
And so little time to get there
Such a long way to go
But I want you to remember
All the love we used to know
Think of me sometimes
My love

Morning morning, sad day
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Morning morning, sad day
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

In the evening I sit
And my thoughts they turn to you
In the evening I think of my home
And I need you to remember
All the love we used to know
Think of me sometimes
My love

Morning morning, sad day
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Morning morning, sad day
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

Mmmmm....
