Broad daylight
Broad daylight
Broad daylight

See the smoke fills my room
Curl and whisper in the gloom
Then I long for the day
When the sun comes out to say

Broad daylight
Broad daylight
Broad daylight
Broad daylight

Now the clock says it's time for bed
Time for sleep the moon just said
Time for tears in your dreams
Will the tears all disappear come

Broad daylight
Broad daylight
Broad daylight
Broad daylight

Broad daylight
Broad daylight
Broad daylight
Broad daylight

Let me feel the morning
When the sun is downing
