Carry me away
I know your angel eyes
Can see through me
Carry me away
Far away from the love you give
So generously, so generously
Woman oh! Oh!

I've got a burning heart
I need to tell you
That it's you I love
I got a burning heart
I need to tell you that
I never get enough
Never, never, never
Never get enough
Woman oh! Oh!

Marry me today
I'll give you all I own
Except my car
Marry me today baby
I'll give you everything
But my guitar
But my guitar and my car
Woman oh! Oh!

Let me hold your tongue
For I know you'll understand
The way I feel
Baby I know you'll understand
That all I want to do
Is take your hand
I don't mean to do no harm Baby
I just want to be your man
Oh! I just want to be your man Baby

Hey I want to be, I want to be
Hey, woman I'll be your man
Woman, I'll be your man
