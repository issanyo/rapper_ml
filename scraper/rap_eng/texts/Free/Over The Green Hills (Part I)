Over the green hills and into the sun
That's where I feel I ought to be goin'
Blue sky above me and green earth below
Don't even matter which way I go Yeah!
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

The trees hold their arms out to catch what life gives
But the people try to snatch all there is
They can have all I own. I don't need anything
I'll just follow the river, and see what it brings
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
