Sitting in a graveyard
Waiting for the dawn
Leaning on my tombstone
Till the night is gone

Oh how the moon
Hangs in black sky
Wish i could find out
The reason why
I sit here alone
And cry

My woman was so lovely
Together we were one
No sunshine in my weary eyes
Now that she has gone

Oh how the moon
Hangs in black sky
Wish I could find out
The reason why
I sit here alone
And cry

Palm trees whisper to me
From your spreading height
Tell me all the loney stories
Of the world at night

Oh how the moon
Hangs in black sky
Wish I could find out
The reason why

I sit here alone
And cry
