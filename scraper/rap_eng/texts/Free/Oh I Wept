Oh I Wept
For days
Filled my eyes
With silly tears
But I don't
Care no more
I don't care if
My eyes get sore

I take my seat on the train
And let the sun come melt my pain
Come tomorrow I'll be far away
In the sunshine of another day

A worried mind
Makes so hard to bear
Hard to live
And hard to care

But I don't
Care no more
I don't care if
My eyes get sore
Now I've left
It all behind
I did not care
To be so unkind

Oh
I did not...

But the street
Is warm and bright
Far away
I'm gonna be tonight
