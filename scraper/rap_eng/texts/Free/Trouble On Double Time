I've been a bad bad boy
And I know I should be good
A bad boy
So long that it must be in my blood oh!
Oh! yeah
Oh! Oh
Let me tell you this
I've been feelin' my way
Every chance I get
You know I love every woman
Every woman you can bet

Trouble on double time

You know my school teacher
Told me before I left school
That a man with two women's
Not a man but a fool

Feelin' my way
Every chance I get
You know I love every woman
Every woman you can bet

Trouble on double time

Feelin' my way
Every chance I get
You know I love every woman
Every woman you can bet

Trouble on double time

It's driving me out of my mind
Driving me out of my mind
Driving me out of my mind
