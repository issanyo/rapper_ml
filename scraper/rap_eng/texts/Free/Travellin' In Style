VERSE 1
Well the train I ride
Is leaving the station
It's the train I ride
To my destination
I was walking
Now I'm traveling in style
I was walking
Now I've got me a ride

VERSE 2
Well I've got no need
For no company
Got my blues guitar
That's all I need
I ain't walking
Now I'm traveling in style
I ain't walking
Now I've got me a ride

VERSE 3
Think I've come to
The end of my song
If you feel you want to
Why don't you sing along
I ain't walking
Now I'm traveling in style
I ain't walking
Now I've got me a ride
I ain't walking
Now I'm traveling in style
I ain't walking
Now I've got me a ride
I ain't walking
Oh no, now I'm traveling in style
I ain't walking
Now I've got me a ride
