Verse I
My luck is terrible
Nothing seems to go as planned
Just lost my job
Just lost my girl
Thought she was in the palm of my hand
Looking for solutions end up with more questions
Trying to live with no problems
Still I end up stressing

Cause my car’s on E
Got 2 dollars to my name
I can’t believe
I’m this broke it’s a shame
I wanna be
On top of my game
But none of this will bring me down (2x)

Chorus
I’m feeling good today
There’s nothing you can say
To take my high away (2x)

Verse II
I wanna be free
Truth is there ain’t too much that you could probably tell me
My check ain’t roll around in about 3 weeks
No pair of lips landed on these cheeks
I may be in a state of vulnerability
You think imma stop living?

Because my car’s on E
Got 2 dollars to my name
I can’t believe
I’m this broke it’s a shame
I wanna be
On top of my game
But none of this will bring me down (2x)

Chorus
I’m feeling good today
There’s nothing you can say
To take my high away (2x)

Im up so high
You can’t bring me down no no (8x)

Oh no you can’t
No no no no you can’t
No, ooh
Up so high you can’t bring me down
Up so high you can’t bring me down no
To the dudes that broke into my car
So glad I don’t know who you are
