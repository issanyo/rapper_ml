[Verse 1]

It's always the same
Always ashamed storytelling
When I can come in
To a hopeless troglodyte

But one more time my answer stood
I swear I mean no offense
But you better learn to read
It's all about membership

[Verse 2]

Spelling it for the young and old
Ugly girls and boys
I put you on my list
And make you clap to this

Is it mayhem or just an ego trip?
But only one can win
And soon you'll say that hymn

[Chorus x2]

D V N O
Four capital letters printed in gold
Cause details make the girls sweat even more
While they're shaking their belts
No need to ask my name to figure out how cool I am

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]

Can anyone read? Anyone feel?
That I'm losing my patience
I just came here to bounce
Ladies are all waxed

They all know I'm coming
I'm losing my patience
I just came here to bounce

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]
