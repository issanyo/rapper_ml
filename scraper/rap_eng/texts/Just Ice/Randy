[Verse 1]
Get up and shake it off
It's time that you listen up and hear the call
Bail out the water
Better not, you're on fire
Backed against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't stop, try to make your mark
And make your mind up
Don't stop, work it out and try to make it

[Chorus]
Randy, get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better
Randy, you don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover
When you know you've arrived
And it's time, don't shoot low
Aim it high
When you know you've arrived
And it's time, take it slow
Shoot it high

[Verse 2]
Hold on to what you've got
And strike while the iron's hot, put up a fight
Those days are good and gone
Keep up, keep on going strong all through the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't stop, try to make your mark
And make your mind up
Don't stop, work it out and try to make it

[Chorus]
Randy, get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better
Randy, you don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover
When you know you've arrived
And it's time, don't shoot low
Aim it high
When you know you've arrived
And it's time, take it slow
Shoot it high

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Feels like the latest version
Now that the wind is turning soft and cool
Next stop, a new dimension
Find something fresh and someone just for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't stop, try to make your mark
And make your mind up
Don't stop, work it out and try to make it

[Chorus]
Randy, get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better
Randy, you don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover
When you know you've arrived
And it's time, don't shoot low
Aim it high
When you know you've arrived
And it's time, take it slow
Shoot it high
