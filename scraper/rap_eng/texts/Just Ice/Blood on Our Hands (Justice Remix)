I am leaving while you turn away
In the basement is where I'm going to stay
There is blood in all the things I say
Will you hate me if I stay this way?
From the bedroom, where we're running from
There's a sequel to the things I've done
You're a woman, we all know it's true
By the things that I've done to you

There is blood on all the shoes you've worn
From the people you were stepping on
There is blood in all the things you say
I won't hate you if you go away

I am leaving while you turn away
In the basement is where I'm going to stay
From the bedroom, where we're running from
There's a sequel to the things I've done

Bring it back to
Bring it back to
Bring it back to
Bring it back to

There is blood on all the shoes you've worn
From the people you were stepping on
There is blood in all the things you say
I won't hate you if you go away

Bring it back to
Bring it back to
Bring it back to
Bring it back to
