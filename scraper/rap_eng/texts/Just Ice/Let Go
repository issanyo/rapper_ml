[Juice Aleem #1:Verse]
A new world light I was raised in the night
Going to the ground where I can shine light
Passed me the seas you must seen me out of sight
One smashed between my left and my right
Hemispheres seen for the soaring
Rule together now my brain start glowing
Puff, puff that inject the snort
You can't get help without life support
We can mash out, and spaz out
Pull the record and splash out
Pull the cold coke lord and get the gold and cash out
Splash out next man will leave your mash mouth
Careful with the swimming with the sharks no doubt
Deceit waters or sleeping with loose organs
Or slip the broken and tally up the last orders
Get broke or fix up across borders
Brand new show if you feel you can afford us

[Justice Hook X2]
With dinner without these bells, rings, and clue
Spaceman crystal ball bali lawn zoo
Frequency, and high frequency
Change in the time and see

[Juice Aleem #2: Verse]
Yo, yo blessing in the backing in the foot push inner linner
Eating into the greedy weed putting the money on the winner
Mixing the winner inner in the front of me rule leaf fam lose a re law
Can't put a silver back a gorilla
Making me smile dummy louder
Higher of the sad contact dash like a be glad
Around the corner broom seen the seas be sad
Around the green is a beast of a wildebeest run that
All come back of a power of an impact
Straight from the land is a cannibal it sure states that
Tic-Tac-Toe is above so below Mongol is so out of control
Back from the burrowed and shout out if you say so
Picking up mine as a pink black holes
