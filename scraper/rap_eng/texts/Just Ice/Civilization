[Verse 1]
Stand in line as we march to the drums of the east
Paralyzed and possessed by crusaders deceased
Lost to the sirens that call from the turbulent tides
Bound by the science that lives on the lips of the wise

[Chorus]
The beating of a million drums
The fire of a million guns
The mother of a million sons
Civilization

The beating of a million drums
The fire of a million guns
The mother of a million sons
Civilization

[Verse 2]
Lost in the silence, they bow to the call of the east
Tantalized and seduced by the demons released
Ears to the ground by the whim of the merciless sky
Onto the fire that burns in the all seeing eye

[Chorus]
The beating of a million drums
The fire of a million guns
The mother of a million sons
Civilization

The beating of a million drums
The fire of a million guns
The mother of a million sons
Civilization

[Bridge: Instrumental]

[Chorus]
The beating of a million drums
The fire of a million guns
The mother of a million sons
Civilization

The beating of a million drums
The fire of a million guns
The mother of a million sons
Civilization

The beating of a million drums
The fire of a million guns
The mother of a million sons
Civilization
