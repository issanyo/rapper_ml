[Verse]
You
So you're running in a best of three
And you gunning on the kingside
For the queen
And You
So you're running in a best of three
And you gunning for it all
May the king fall

[Chorus]
New lands
Trust embedded on the sand
New lands
Trust embedded on the sand
New lands
Trust in us embedded on the sand
New lands

[Verse]
You
So you're running in a best of three
And you gunning on the kingside
For the queen
And You
So you're running in a best of three
And you gunning for it all
May the king fall

[Chorus]
New lands
Trust embedded on the sand
New lands
Trust embedded on the sand
New lands
Trust in us embedded on the sand
New lands

[Bridge]
(New lands
New lands
New lands
New lands)

[Chorus]
New lands
Trust embedded on the sand
New lands
Trust embedded on the sand
New lands
Trust in us embedded on the sand
New lands
New lands
Trust embedded on the sand
New lands
Trust embedded on the sand
New lands
Trust in us embedded on the sand
New lands
