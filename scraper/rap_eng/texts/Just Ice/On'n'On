[Verse 1]
Before day break there were none
And as it broke there was one
The moon, the sun, it goes on'n'on

The winter battle was won
The summer children were born
And so the story goes on'n'on

[Bridge]
Come woman if your life beats
Those we buried with the house keys
Smoke and feather where the fields are green
From here to eternity

Come woman in your own time
Far far far from the virgin vine
Rising up from the dead leaves
Come back to me

[Chorus]
Oh, she sings her favorite song
Laughter, tears and dreams
It goes on'n'on

[Verse 2]
A vessel in the bloodline
The thirteenth zodiac sign
A stitch in time it goes on'n'on

Someday the grapes will be wine
And someday you will be mine
And so the story goes on'n'on

[Bridge]
Come woman if your life beats
Those we buried with the house keys
Smoke and feather where the fields are green
From here to eternity

Come woman in your own time
Far far far from the virgin vine
Rising up from the dead leaves
Come back to me

[Chorus]
Oh, she sings her favorite song
Laughter, tears and dreams
It goes on'n'on

[Chorus]
Oh, she sings her favorite song
Laughter, tears and dreams
It goes on'n'on

[Verse 3]
That which was put in the ground
Will someday come back around
From dust to dust it goes on'n'on

Before daybreak there were none
And as it broke there was one
And still the story goes on'n'on
