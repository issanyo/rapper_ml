Standing in line as we march to the drums of the east
Paralyzed and possessed by crusader's deceit
Lost to the sirens that call from the turbulent tide
Bound by the science that lives on the lips of the wise

The beating of a million drums
The fire of a million guns
The mother of a million sons
Civilization

Stand aside as they bow to the call of the east
Tantalized and seduced by the demons relief
Dance to the ground by the whim of the merciless sky
Born to the fire that burns in the all seeing eye

The beating of a million drums
The fire of a million guns
The mother of a millions sons
Civilization
