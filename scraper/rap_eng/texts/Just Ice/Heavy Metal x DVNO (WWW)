The fire of a million guns
The mother of a million sons

Four capital letters, printed in gold
Cause details make the girls sweat even more
While they're shaking their belts
No need to ask my name to figure out how cool I am

Can anyone read, anyone feel
That I'm losing my patience, I just came here to bounce
Ladies all waxed, they all know I'm coming
I'm losing my patience, I just came here to bounce
