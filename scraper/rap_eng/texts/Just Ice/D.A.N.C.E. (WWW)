[Intro]
â€”dance

[Verse 1]
Do the D.A.N.C.E
1, 2, 3, 4 Fight!
Stick to the B.E.A.T
Get ready to ignite
You were such a P.Y.T
Catching all the lights
Just easy as A.B.C
That's how you make it right!

[Bridge]
Do the D.A.N.C.E
Stick to the B.E.A.T
Just easy as A.B.C

[Chorus]
Do the dance, do the dance
The way you move is a mystery
Do the dance
You're always there for music and me
Do the dance
The way you move is a mystery
Do the dance
You're always there for music and me

[Verse 2]
Under the spotlight
Neither black nor white
It doesn't matter
Do the dance, do the dance
As strong as you might
Working day and night
Whatever happens
Do the dance, do the dance
Under the spotlight
Neither black nor white
It doesn't matter
Do the dance, do the dance
As strong as you might
Working day and night
Whatever happens

[Chorus]
Do the dance, do the dance
The way you move is a mystery
Do the dance
You're always there for music and me
Do the dance
The way you move is a mystery
Do the dance
You're always there for music and me
Man up, hold tight
Driving dark (Do the dance, do the dance)
Head up, foot down
Speed of sound (The way you move is a mystery)
Time's up, kick start
Keep on track (Do the dance, do the dance)
Flags out, sit back
Safe and sound (You're always there for music and me, me)
