[Chorus]
Man up, hold tight
Driving dark
Head up, foot down
Speed of sound
Time's up, kick start
Keep on track
Flags out, sit back
Safe and sound

Man up, hold tight
Driving dark
Head up, foot down
Speed of sound
Time's up, kick start
Keep on track
Flags out, sit back
Safe and sound

Man up, hold tight
Driving dark
Head up, foot down
Speed of sound
Time's up, kick start
Keep on track
Flags out, sit back
Safe and sound

Man up, hold tight
Driving dark
Head up, foot down
Speed of sound
Time's up, kick start
Keep on track
Flags out, sit back
Safe and sound

Man up, hold tight
Driving dark
Head up, foot down
Speed of sound
Time's up, kick start
Keep on track
Flags out, sit back
Safe and sound

Man up, hold tight
Driving dark (Do the dance, do the dance)
Head up, foot down
Speed of sound (The way you move is a mystery)
Time's up, kick start
Keep on track (Do the dance, do the dance)
Flags out, sit back
Safe and sound (You're always there for music and me)


Under the spotlight
Neither black nor white
It doesn't matter
Do the dance, do the dance
As strong as you might
Working day and night
Whatever happens
Do the dance, do theâ€”
