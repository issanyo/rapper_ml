[Hook]
Because we are your friends
You'll never be alone again
Ooh, come on, ooh come on
Ooh, come on, ooh come on

Because we are your friends
You'll never be alone again
Ooh, come on, ooh come on
Ooh, come on, ooh come on

Because we are your friends
You'll never be alone again
Ooh, come on, ooh come on
Ooh, come on, ooh come on

[Instrumental]
