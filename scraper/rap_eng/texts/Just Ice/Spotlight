[Verse 1 : Cavin]
Now I'm living in the moment
Yeah you know I'm gonna own it
The fans are what I ride for
My team is what I'll die for
I'll even spit it like a Beretta
To get the flow better
You already know that I am
Ripping it, flipping it, sharpening, riveting going and flowing, I'm already knowing that I'm keeping it grooving and keeping it moving
Yeah we got it like that
I know that my homie's got my back
This style of mine is one of a kind
I built it off the independent and the 90's
Never knowing when I'll be flowing
But all I know is that I'll keep it going
I'll do this till I'm in a casket
I know that you blast it
Cause this flow is hard to master
I got precision and punch like a blaster
But my lyrics aren't going to be weak
Cause these rappers are going to be meek
I ain't talking about mill, but you know where I'm going with this right?
I know that I'm going even with the lights
I'm still trying to get my first pair of flights
Yeah I'm broke as fuck
But one day I'll blow money like I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2 : Cavin]
I'm killing every beat that I hear
I'll kill every line that your favorite rappers say
Cause I'm the one that they fear
Back then I was running from the cops
I will never fold on the flops
Cause I'm going all in on the stops
And the legends are going to give me props
I'm never selling my soul
Some of my lyrics are so cold
That your ears feel like their at sub zero
Degrees
I don't have time to kill them with the speed
They already killing themselves by talking about money, bitches, alcohol, and weed
Goddamn I'm gonna make the next bible
Cause my whole run is tribal
And I'll kill it with unconventional
Everything we do they say it is fictional
They talk about me like I'm a myth
But I'm a young Jedi, so fuck the Sith
I'm pursuing the next Illmatic
If I do hit it then your favorites careers will be tragic
I'm repping Texas
The nickname is Flexas
I'm killing it even through the nexus
Cause I rule the metroplex's
Now tell me who the best is?
