[Ain't It Funny]
Verbal couture
Parkour
With the metaphors
The flow house of horror
Dead bolted with metal doors
Grinch bitch
Six sense
With a nose drip
Mind skydive
Sniffing bumps
In the cockpit
Locksmith of Hip Hop
Appraisal the wrist watch
The rocks bout the size
As the teeth in Chris Rock's mouth
Sock out the mic
Prototype for Adderall
Your work killing fiends
Cause you cut it with Fentanyl
So much coke
Just to sniff need a ski lift
Flip your table over
If you cut it with the bullshit
Nose bleeds red carpets
But it just blend in
Snapping pictures
Feeling my chest being sunk in
Live a fast life
Seen many die slowly
Unhappy when they left
So I try to seize the moment
Funny how it happens
Who ever would imagine
That joke's on you
But Satan the one laughing

Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it

I can sell honey to a bee
In the fall time
Make trees
Take back they leaves
Octopus in a straight jacket
Savage with bad habits
Broke serving fiends
Got rich became a addict
Ain’t it funny how it happens
Who would ever would imagine
Nose running right now
Could ya pass me a napkin
Managed to somehow
To have the upper advantage
Panic when the drugs are gone
And nobody is answering
Ain’t it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
No way to mask it
A lot became has beens
Rolling up that 100 dollar bill
Till they cash in
Thinks it gone last
Going too fast
Man it's fucked up
Ain't it funny how it happens

Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happen

Upcoming heavy traffic
Say ya need to slow down
Cause you feel yourself crashing
Staring in the devil face
But ya can’t stop laughing
Staring in the devil face
But ya can't stop laughing
It’s a living nightmare
That most of us might share
Inherited in our blood
It's why we stuck in the mud
Can’t quit the drug use
Or the alcohol abuse
Even if I wanted to
Tell you what I’m gonna do
I’ma wash away my problems
With this bottle of Henny
Anxiety got the best of me
So popping them Xannies
Might need rehab
But to me that shit pussy
Pray for me y’all
Cause I don't know what coming to me
Bought a 8 ball of coke
And my nigga on the way
Got 3 hoes with him
And they all tryna play
Ain't it funny how it happens
Who ever would imagine
Jokes on you
But Satan the one laughing

Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it

[Grown Up]
Remember when my first meal was school lunch
Now I spit a 16 straight with no punch
Remember all for dinner all we ate was Captain Crunch
Now we blow big blunts on the way to brunch
Went from good fella to commissary slips
Now I got back up man every time I slipped
Never ever quit, I just kept on pursuing
Teacher always ask me, what was I doing
Scribbled in my notebook and never did homework
Low attention span, guess these Adderall worked
Rocked Tommy Hil shirts, ones with the boat
Rockport kicks way before we even smoked
Used to have baby lungs, choking when I hit it
Nowadays lace a whole seven in a sitting
Remember back then we thought we growed up
Rushing as a kid just to be grown up

Rushing as a kid just to be grown up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up

I can eat a pound and shit sixty four quarters
Burn up fire and drown drops of water
Son, I told you I got them beans like Goya
Gone off them pills got me jumping off the sofa
Hotter than a Hot Pocket out the devil microwave
Model bitches begging just be a nigga's sex slave
Exotic foreign garments lookin' tailor made
And when these bitches see me man they wetter than the everglades
Everyday same shit, me getting paid
Waking up, new bitch, it's me getting laid
Used to take bottle back, waitress bring the bottle back
Now they see me shining and they looking like a Sour Patch
Nigga catch a heart attack, Newport soft pack never blow blunt wraps
But these blunt raps sewn up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up

Rushing as a kid just to be grown up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up
Rushing as a kid just to be grown up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up
Rushing as a kid just to be grown up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up
Rushing as a kid just to be grown up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up

[I Will]
Put a cup up, put a four up in it
Sixes on that Chevy with some hoes in it
Put a cup up, put a four up in it
Sixes on that Chevy with some hoes in it
What he won't do – bitch, I will
What he won't do – bitch, I will
What he won't do – bitch, I will
What he won't do – bitch, I will

Take it off, baby, bend over, let me see it
You looking for a real pussy eater? I can be it
Quit playing with me, girl, and bring that over here
And climb aboard my face, put that pussy on my beard
I ain't tryna take you shopping, buy your ass no shoes
I'm tryna lick that clit while I'm looking up at you
No shame in my game, girl, look back at me
I don't give a fuck if it's shaved or it's nappy
Long as it ain't nasty, sanitation smelling
One whiff of that bitch, I'mma be bailing
If it's smelling sweet, I'mma lick it for a hour
And even if it's sour, I might lick it in the shower
I go dumb and ignorant when I'm on that clitoris
Lick your ass delirious, my tongue game so damn serious
So bend that ass over, let me eat it from the back
That pussy so good, have a nigga coming back

Put a cup up, put a four up in it
Sixes on that Chevy with some hoes in it
Put a cup up, put a four up in it
Sixes on that Chevy with some hoes in it
What he won't do – bitch, I will
What he won't do – bitch, I will
What he won't do – bitch, I will
What he won't do – bitch, I will

Oh, that nigga scared, let me show you what it's 'bout
Spread apart them lips, put that clit up in my mouth
And that thang so juicy, I'mma call it jamba
Licking it in circles got me calling me your papa
Tongue going faster, singing La Labamba
Tryna keep my rhythm like the bongos in samba
I'm a pussy monster, blowing on that ganja
After I finish, look like you was in a sauna
Toes curling up while you're grabbing on the sheets
Spitting on that pussy real sloppy when I eat
Slobbing on that pussy, after that, I don't cuddle
I put that dick up on her, make her sleep up in the puddle
Bitch, I ain't afraid, I eat it up in public
Feet up on the windshield, broad day, fuck it
Sixty-nine in hotels with the lights on
Tongue worth a million, I don't need ice on

Put a cup up, put a four in it
Sixes on that Chevy with some hoes in it
Them hoes playing, they don't wanna fuck
I'mma put they ass out, they gone be walking, bruh
And I'm swagged up, I'm off a pill
Could fuck you for a hour 'cause I can't feel
Said I'm swagged up, I'm off a pill
Could fuck you for a hour 'cause I can't feel
Put a cup up, put a four in it
Sixes on that Chevy with some hoes in it
Them hoes playing, they don't wanna fuck
I'mma put they ass out, they gone be walking, bruh
And I'm swagged up, I'm off a pill
Could fuck you for a hour 'cause I can't feel
Said I'm swagged up, I'm off a pill
Could fuck you for a hour 'cause I can't feel
Put a cup up, put a four in it
Sixes on that Chevy with some hoes in it
Them hoes playing, they don't wanna fuck
I'mma put they ass out, they gone be walking, bruh
And I'm swagged up, I'm off a pill
Could fuck you for a hour 'cause I can't feel
Said I'm swagged up, I'm off a pill
Could fuck you for a hour 'cause I can't feel

[Accelerator]
Rap Ralph Bashki
Smoking teriyaki
Verbal kamikaze
Axel at the roxy
In the men's room
With a groupie sniffing oxys
Getting sloppy toppy
Smelling like wasabi
You niggas mulianies
I swear they work with Johnny
Get locked
Get out and walk around
And act like that shit funny
You niggas from the era of finessing
That is bummy
I'm from the era, flip that
And you get that man his money
I think these niggas addict
They can't control their habits
Paying for these hoes
But tricks for silly rabbits
I'm more Black Sabbath
Not your average rapper rapping
Lamping up in Lanvin
Feeling like I'm a Buchannon
Ya hoes too demanding
My flows too outstanding
Lets me and you play a game
Of last man standing
Way above your standards
Nothing that you can imagine
Body in the clouds
And my mind's gone camping

Walking light, the ground is so shaky
Losing sight 'cause things is so hazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Walking light, the ground is so shaky
Losing sight 'cause things is so hazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy

You can hate, you can hate
You get stitches from this brick up in your face
Every morning, every night, and every day
I think of shit to make you feel some type of way
My homie caught a murder case
And I seen 'em since
Just had a daughter
Baby mama need rent
It don't make no sense
So I don't add it up
So don't worry 'cause I got it
Nigga keep ya head up
Rap niggas brag about it
But ain't ever live it
I never try to glorify
I tell it how it is
You ain't ever copped a big
Broke it down in all nicks
Or a nigga in ya crib
Saying where is that shit
Think these niggas tripping
Gone camping
I see it clear as day
HD on a Samsung
Champion of critics
Give a fuck about ya gimmicks
They mimicking the streets
When I used to really live it

Walking light, the ground is so shaky
Losing sight 'cause things is so hazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Walking light, the ground is so shaky
Losing sight 'cause things is so hazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy

[Lie4]

Eating at the Whitney, now your bitch wanna come with me
'Cause we 'bout to go to the mall, tonight we popping bottles
My baby momma a hoodrat but now I got me a model
And she wanna swallow, drink it all up
Straight to the neck from the bottle, bitch you don't need no cup
And she 'bout to go make it rain, thunder, fucking storm
Kush nuggets to the brain, pop fucking corn

[Die Like A Rockstar]
Brown bless the mic like gesundheit
Bud 'bout the size of a bonsai
Kick it like Muay Thai, flow like sci-fi in high def
I'm righteous and still bust a nut up on a bitch chest
The verbal folklore been explored
And employed by none other than them fools with the gold
And them bankrolls explode
And your bitch is my target when I shoot my load
Bulls-eye, my eyes tie-dyed
Fried off the same shit that rockstars died from
Smoke something with your man bitch
Like Wyclef used to sell the cannabis
Manuscript sick shit, prescription addiction
Sniffing adderall off the counter in my kitchen
Tripping off the shit that had Brian Wilson flipping
Experiment so much it's a miracle I'm living

And I'mma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar
I'mma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar

Bitch I wanna party like Chris Farley
Shot of Hennessy spike that with some molly
Tell mommy I'm sorry, God bless my soul
But life is so sublime going out like Brad Nowell
I got that Kurt Cobain type of mind-frame
Feeling like Keith Moon shrooms in my dressing room
Basquiat freestyle
Feeling like Jimi Hendrix in Anna-Nicole's mouth
River Phoenix '93 VIP
With some drugged up porn hoes all around me
Like Teri Diver, Linda Wong
All in hell having orgies where the horns grow long
Cause bitch I'm Frankie Lymon, Heath Ledger
Hyped up in a jacuzzi doing that John Belushi
With Brittany Murphy, we blowing hershey
I'mma die like a rockstar

And I'mma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar
I'mma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar

[Blunt After Blunt]
Kush got a nigga feeling awesome
Ate that bitch pussy 'til she squirted like a dolphin
Told her bend over, hit that shit doggy
Called her a cab then I told that bitch to call me
Danny Brown bitch, tell me what you need
I got some Adderall and fire ass weed
And they try to tell me I get too high
That's a lie, if so, bitch, I woulda been died
But the flow OD, don't get cochesed, capiche?
Fuck with me, fuck around and be deceased
Rest in peace wack niggas with your oversized clothes
Complain about my jeans cause I'm taking all they hoes
Hold up, wait a minute
Your pussy ain't shit 'til you had some Danny in it
I'm gone off a Xanny nodding off watching Menace
Rolling on some purple that my nigga call Grimmace
Bitch I ain't finish
These bars was test tubed in the lab with foreign chemist
Rolling testers on it but statistics got slumped
I'm smoking blunt after blunt

And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt
And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt

'til my brain feels ten pounds heavier
You fell off like Tom Selleck in a Celica
Bitch give me brain for the hell of it
But to her it's heaven even if she gets a smell of it
That's why these bitches fuck with me
Cause I eat that pussy like a female MC
You get it? How about me and your girlfriend, you with it?
Money over everything the only thing that matter
And since I been getting it my been blunts getting fatter
Take a couple puffs off it now a nigga woozy
The white hoes I fuck with consider them whooties
We 'bout to make a movie, starring me and a cast full of groupies
And I do my own stunts, I'm smoking blunt after blunt
And I smoke
