Get up and shake it off
It's time that you listen up and hear the call
Bail out the water
Better not, you're on fire
Backed against the wall

Don't stop, try to make your mark
And make your mind up
Don't stop, work it out and try to make it

Randy, get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better
Randy, you don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover
When you know you've arrived
And it's time, don't shoot low
Aim it high
When you know you've arrived
And it's time, take it slow
Shoot it high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high

Don't shoot low, low, low, low, low, low
Don't shoot low, low, low, low, low, low
Don't shoot low, low, low, low, low, low
Don't shoot low, low, low, low, low, low
High, high, high

Don't shoot low, low, low, low, low, low
Don't shoot low, low, low, low, low, low
Don't shoot low, low, low, low, low, low
Don't shoot low, low, low, low, low, low
High, high, high

Low, low, low, low, low, low
Don't shoot low, low, low, low, low, low

High, high, high

Low, low, low, low, low, low
Don't shoot low, low, low, low, low, low
Don't shoot low, low, low, low, low, low
Don't shoot low, low, low, low, low, low
High, high, high

Low, low, low, low, low, low
Don't shoot low, low, low, low, low, low
