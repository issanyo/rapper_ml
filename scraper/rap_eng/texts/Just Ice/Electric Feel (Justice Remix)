[Intro - Hook]
I said, ooh, girl, shock me like an electric feel
Baby girl, turn me on with your electric feel

[Instrumental Bridge]
All along the western front, people line up to receive
She got the power in her hand to shock you like you won't believe
Saw her in the Amazon with the voltage running through her skin
Standing there with nothing on, she gonna teach me how to swim

[Hook]
I said, ooh, girl, shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl, turn me on with your electric feel
I said, ooh, girl, shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl, turn me on with your electric feel

All along the eastern shore, put your circuits in the sea
This is what the world is for making electricity
You can feel it in your mind, oh you can do it all the time
Plug it in, change the world, you are my electric girl

[Hook]
I said, ooh, girl, shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl, turn me on with your electric feel
I said, ooh, girl, shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl, turn me on with your electric feel

Do what you feel now
Electric feel, now
Do what you feel now
Electric feel, now
Do what you feel now
Electric feel, now
Do what you feel now
Electric feel, now
