So many times we rise and fall
After a while it's coming all together
Together
So many times we rise and fall
Wondering if we'll find it all together
Together

Remember all the nights and days we spent together
(Together)
It's so easy to forget and to surrender
But nothing's ever stopped

Music and lights
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lights
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories

So many times we rise and fall
After a while it's coming all together
(Together)
So many ways to lose it all
Living a future we won't have to give up
Together

Remember all the nights and days we spent together
(Together)
It's so easy to forget and to surrender
But nothing's ever stopped

Music and lights
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lights
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories

(But nothing's ever stopped)
Music and lights
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lights
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lights
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lights
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories
(Take us to the top)

But nothing's ever stopped
