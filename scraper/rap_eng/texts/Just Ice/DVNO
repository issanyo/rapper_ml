[Verse 1]
It's always the same
Always ashamed storytelling
"When I can come in"
To a hopeless troglodyte
But one more time my answer stands
I swear I mean no offense
But you better learn to read
It's all 'bout membership

[Verse 2]
I spell it for the young and old
Ugly girls and boys
I put you on my list
And make you clap to this
Is it mayhem or just an ego trip
Only one can win
And soon you'll say "that's him"

[Hook]
D-V-N-O
Four capital letters, printed in gold
Cause details make the girls sweat even more
While they're shaking their belts
No need to ask my name to figure out how cool I am
D-V-N-O
Four capital letters, printed in gold
Cause details make the girls sweat even more
While they're shaking their belts
No need to ask my name to figure out how cool I am

[Refrain]
Can anyone read, anyone feel
That I'm losing my patience, I just came here to bounce
Ladies all waxed, they all know I'm coming
I'm losing my patience, I just came here to bounce
Can anyone read, anyone feel
That I'm losing my patience, I just came here to bounce
Ladies all waxed, they all know I'm coming
I'm losing my patience, I just came here to bounce
