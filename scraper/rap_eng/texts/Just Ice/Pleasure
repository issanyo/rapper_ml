By the laws of attraction
And the rules of the game
(Figure it out)
There's a chemical reaction
Between pleasure and pain

Use imagination
As a destination
Use imagination
As a destination
Use imagination
And come closer
Forever be

Closer
Closer for there to be
Pleasure
Closer
Forever be

Is there more to seduction?
Is it wrong? Is it vain?
Is it love or easy action?
Is it all just the same?

And come closer
Forever be
