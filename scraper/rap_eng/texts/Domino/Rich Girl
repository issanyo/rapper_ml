[Intro]

[Pre-Hook]
All she likes is fancy cars, shoes and bars
Trains or boats, she loves to float
With the shooting stars
Must elope when we breath real hard

[Verse 1: Domino]
Taking a trip yup, while we tripping
Lost in her eyes my mind is missing
I think I want the sweeter things in life
She tastes like a diamond and her nails are like knifes
And I like it, might kiss, fight this slight bliss
Voice feels like silence every time she speaks
Got me feeling weak
Looking like a magazine, heels and the mink uh
Every day is fashion week
Every nights a holiday
Every time I sneak a peak
Like photos just to make her day
Checks 'em just like scene delete
Wants to look perfect baby
You’re perfect
Hands on your print, yeah
She’s pretty like cursive


[Hook]
All she likes is fancy cars, shoes and bars
All she likes is fancy cars, shoes and bars
All she likes is fancy cars, shoes and bars
Trains or boats, she loves to float
Loves to float

[Verse 2: Domino]
My Louis Vuitton ma, Gucci and Prada
Praying to Allah, God and Buddah
Porsche's, impalas she driving me crazy
Smelling like money she calling me
(Baby)
Baby baby
Tell me how you want it
Limos or jets cause I know you wanna flaunt it
(Baby baby)
Tell me why you taunt it
Feel frets, I can tell that you want it
I can tell how you do it
I can tell that she got it
But she got a cold shoulder and a heart filled with boulders
And some veins filled with toxic
Tonic filled saliva here's some gin
Got some sin, I don’t think that she can stop it
Wrist watch or gold watch up in the pocket
Piss pot, miss piper didn’t pop in
Poops gold and, steals souls of
Young men who don’t know that
All she likes is fancy cars
