Water was running
Children were running
You were running out of time

Under the mountain
A golden fountain
Were you praying at the Lares shrine?

But, oh - oh your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh - oh your city lies in dust, my friend

We found you hiding
We found you lying
Choking on the dirt and sand

Your former glories
And all the stories
Dragged and washed with eager hands

But, oh - oh your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh - oh your city lies in dust... my friend
Your city lies in dust

Water was running
Children were running
We found you hiding
We found you lying
Water was running
Children were running
We found you hiding
We found you lying

Your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh - oh your city lies in dust... my friend

Hot and burning in your nostrils
Pouring down your gaping mouth
Your molten bodies, blanket of cinders
Caught in the throes, and

Woah oh - oh your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh - oh your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh - oh your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh - oh your city lies in dust... my friend
Your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh - oh your city lies in dust, my friend
Oh - oh your city lies in dust, my friend
