[Verse 1: Domino]
Now young bitches got it goin' on and here's a new thing
She looks of twenty-one, but she's under eighteen
Now picture a man with a plan, what's he gonna do?
She's only sixteen, but looks twenty-two
And age isn't a factor cuz she's fine to the dude
And plus she's built like a truck there must be somethin' in her food
Or her water
Because she's somebody's daughter
Who's attractive to a son, as well their father's
And they know this, that ass sticks with us
And like my homie told me once she's quite bootylicious
Watch your mouth drop with them dubs that she threw on
Dandy like candy, so you can get your chew on
What'cha wanna do? What'cha gonna do?
When you find out that she's far from twenty-two?
Yo it's not the same G, when you game G
With the dames drop a line like this before you do

[Chorus]
Do you qualify? It sure looks good to me
Do you qualify? It sure looks good to me

[Verse 2: Domino]
What's up with these bitches tryin' to play us like a fool?
Lookin' of age real proper, but just enrollin' in high school
I'm callin' 'em collard greens cuz they're corn bread fed
Runnin' more game than what your homie Simon said
Yo what is this, new statistic?
Went from pants and vaseline to short skirts and lipstick
You ask who to blame? I don't know but I'ma
Take it upon myself, and blame it on they Mama
For beatin' that ass with a baseball bat
Swole it all up now it's proper and fat
Fed 'em attitudes, Big Macs, and milk
Leave 'em all alone and it's on in the jilt
Or the house, cuz that's where they open up they mouth
So in the day she's a child, at night she's an adult
And Diggity Domino I like to ride it like a tractor
But there's a question at hand because that age is a factor

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Domino]
There was a man named Bill, on a Saturday night he went to a club
And read a sign before he entered it saying "eighteen and up"
But we know that's just a game for the man, that's runnin'
Thangs cuz he's lettin' all the fly bitches come in
Regardless of the age and shit
But since this story's about Bill let's get back to it
Bill met a collard green, she looks mean
Ran a little game now she's on the team
You know what comes next, took her to the snooty
Treated her like a salad, tossed up the booty
Bill played it wrong, and he got lazy
No protection, guess what, oopsy daisy!
Now baby's pregnant
Cuz Bill neglected
To be protected
Now he's arrested
One year under eighteen and you're through
So if you're game drop a line like this before you do:

[Chorus (2x)]
