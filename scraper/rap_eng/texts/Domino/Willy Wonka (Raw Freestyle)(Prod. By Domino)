Intro:

Uh, yeah, check

[Verse 1: Shockwave]

It's Shockwave with an ill flow
So vivid it can clearly show
Christian til' the death of me
I spit til' there's no breath in me
I'm an Assassin, blood in, blood out
So much flow these other rappers are feeling drought
Uh, i get on my pills, i'm showcasing my skills
I'm payin' lyrical bills like i'm spittin' tills
I'm flexing my skills and accepting my flaws
No remorse when i flex my claws
I can't write so i freestyle
I flip lines and break spines
No tampines
Super powers like a medallian
Unnatural, i'm an alien
Told y'all i got mad flow
Ya flow like a turtle, too slow
I'm no hero, smoke Eno, not your amigo
My flow? Burnin', like Nero
Yours? Beyond zero
Burst your ego, for real though
I'm ill though, i kill though, i still flow, i'm sick though
Mic killer, beat spitter
You emcees too weak you couldn't get realer

Outro:

Yeah, i'm out
