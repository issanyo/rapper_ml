If you look at me baby
I will look at you
If youre good to me baby
Ill be good to you

I think youre old fashioned
And you think Im a tramp
But are you just gonna sit there
And watch me as I dance

You say youre so perfect and pretty
I'm taking you with me
Going away from the city life
Baby God will help us *
And everyone will be jealous
Cause someday well be throwing rides

I could be such a wonder
And you could be such a monster
Baby I dont want to fight
I dont care where we go
I don't care if they know
I just want to be by your side
In the tropical moonlight

Whats it gonna be baby?
Whats it gonna be?
If Im good to you
You better be good to me

Now that I'm at these dance
I won't get so serious
I just want to have fun
Cause Im young and curious

Gone into madness
Im a mayhem
And a triumph for blood
I want you babe
Again and again
Whenever I wake up

I could be such a wonder
And you could be such a monster
Baby I dont wanna fight
I dont care if they know
I dont care if we go
I just want to hold you tight
In the tropical moonlight

Sometimes Im wide older
Baby thats a star
A lie that I can tell
Sometimes Ill get jealous
And sometimes I won't get jealous
And sometimes Ill pretend Im someone else

I could be such a wonder
And you could be such a monster
Baby I dont want to fight
I dont care if they know
I dont care where we go
I just want to be by your side
In the tropical moonlight
