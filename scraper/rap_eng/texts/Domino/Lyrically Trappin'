[Verse 1:Domino]
Roll 'em fat, cuz nigga ion like 'em skinny
Sippin remy, I'll serve 'em any time like denny's
Tryna hustle for these benjis
And be rollin' in a Bentley
I hope god's willin' cuz the devils tryna temp me
So don't be trippin' cuz if i catch you niggas slippin'
I'm comin' down the lane like my name was Blake Griffen
Might melt ya brain if you listen, to long cuz what i'm spittin
Inside this fuckin' written, is jaw droppin' demolition
Got kind of a coo flow, cuz I spit off these bong rips
Now i got these muh fuckas like damn the boy Dom spit
Keep killin it like this, watch me be on quick
And I can feel the money comin cuz my fuckin palms itch
Im tryna get the family straight, could you even relate?
Ain't no hustle i could hate if you puttin food on yo plate
Dont spend it all in once place, let it stack in the safe
I'm tryna make a muh fuckin 100 racks in a day
I got that old school 90's flow, boy I'm classic
And i gotta old soul, I'm startin to feel jurassic
So many bars, dumb niggas'll turn it off and wouldn't slap this
Cuz they sleepin on me like a mattress
Call me rap assassin, write a rap on a napkin
Wipe my ass wit it cuz its the shit if you askin
This beat's gon need a coffin, gotta casket in the back
And a basket for you flabbergasted bastards cuz I'm gassin
Rollin up that shit, you might pass out when I'm passin
Ima savage, wit this package, man I'm tryna get this cabbage
You see i'm after cash and i got no time for cappin
In the back, cookin crack, nigga I'm Lyrically Trappin
Left the booth a murder scene, they came back and asked what happened
They said "Dom was in here rappin
You know that nigga be snappin"
Like a slam, poetry, they know it's me, bitch i'm the captain
Flowin like a river current, currently somewhere snackin'
Nigga ima keep on bussin, til moms won't need for nothin
If you even think of touchin, you gon seek the repercussions
My family's hella crazy, you might see them heaters bussin
That's why Paul killed Peter cuz Peter was always bluffin
Niggas not solid, its crazy how friends turn to suckas
Start doin bad and wanna rob you plottin undercover
But niggas dumb, yo pillow talkin got you caught up brotha
You come around here and you gettin killed muh fucka
Hope it don't to that cuz all I wanna do is rap
Smoke weed and chill wit bitches, watch how my niggas trap
Spend a stack, flip it get it back, plus the profit
As long as they got the product, ain't no way you can stop it
