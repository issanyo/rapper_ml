[Intro: Do Or Die Aka  A-Love]
Smooth, baby
Steady dippin'
And for all the B-K's in '93
But you don't hear me though
Straight everyday banging
Slanging, you know what I mean?
Huh, that evil-ass C-Side
Steady dippin'

[Verse 1: Do Or Die Aka A-Love]
Back into my neighborhood, stop at daytime
Get a bag of chips and a dollar wine
Roll down Greenleaf, make a left on Caress
Fire up the indo, can't fuck with the stress
Hangin' out with my niggas (Fire up the bud, Cuz)
Sittin' in my '4
With fingers on the trigger
Always ready for some set trippin'
That's why I'm dippin' and dappin', crippin' and dippin' never catch me slippin'
Checkin' out the bitches (What's up bitch?)
Raise up the phone
And fuck with the switches
Front back
And pause on threes
Rag Top Four
Sittin' on them D's
Checkin' ass for the big booty one (Damn, she got ass)
Mackin to the skunk and let her ride shotgun
Roll by the park
And check the niggaros
Straight-up Crips and G rolls (What's up Cuz?!)
Checkin' out the niggas from hangin' like nuts
Even when One-Time pulls up
One-Time'll get checked like a bitch
White boys in his niggas' click (Bitch!)
Move on before you can't pass
And before April 3rd come back to haunt your ass
You ain't gon' change a goddamn thang
The plan is simple cause thangs don't change
When you're gone (Shit ain't changed Cuz!)
We still be crippin'
And makin' cash money
Steady dippin'

[Hook: DJ Quik]
The underground is moving thangs!

[Verse 2: Miss C-Note]
Watching Boyz N Tha Hood with do or die
Them Crips is rollin' deep and I’m slob niggas drivin' red Hyndias
That’s why I couldn't be a Snoop, I gots to have my 9
My BKs an' my muthafuckin’ Coupe
In my Caddy hittin' corners, hittin' the switches, droppin' quick 'Ru niggas by my Tip
Like a bitch
6-0 Rollin deep murderin' them 20’s Crenshaw Mafia
I kill them good and plenty
C-Note is the muthafuckin' G-Bitch
I got my grip tuck down in my cleavage
And if a nigga wanna jack I got my steel dip gat
Strap down, where the muthafuckin' pussy at
Hit a ‘Ru nigga cause I gots somethin to prove?
Take him to a motel and pull a muthafuckin’ jack move
Me become a slob oooh, never!
C'Note: a muthafuckin' Crip forever..

[Hook: DJ Quik]

[Verse 3: Sin Loc]
Much Crip love
On a blue day like this
Packin' a .44
Roll in a Crip 6'
They call me Sin Loc
Yes, the G that ain't no joke
The mystery of mess
With a killa Snoop rat flow
See a Slob's brain dread while I'm dippin'
And I'mma hit the fool up
With two C's cause I'm steady crippin'
Sin Loc a mastermind of respect
So you don't get it twisted
Cause if you do Stretch you get stretched
Sayin' to keeps no bustas outta gangbang fool
Much Crip love and we can't stand die-'Rus
Now if it's twisted then I twisted for your kid sake
See cause I'm roll about mine that means I don't fake
So put your dead rag back into your pocket fool
Only thang you swingin' on us nuts when I drop you
Ain't noboby living like no dead rag busta
And when I'm steady dippin'
Respect is from the shoulders
Cause Sin Loc'll peel any Snoop At his own will
But It's time for black folks to try to take a chill pill
And quit going against the grain on each other
Cause worst than dread, I can't stand to see a dead brother
So I ain't trippin' on them bustas if I catch 'em slippin'
I just don't give mines up and just keep steady dippin'

[Verse 4: Blue Ragg]
I'm dippin' on the East Side of the Compton Hub
For the neighborhood Crip gang Cuz I got much love
I'm givin' it up
To the rest of the Crip gangs
Steady crippin' and puttin' in work on them Slobs main
Kelly Park, Atlantic drive and South Side
Spook towns always down to hoo-ride
Farm dog, nutty blocc and tragniew
It's killin' up them Snoops like Vietnam goose
Lantana blocc, the swamps and original front
Be hoo-ridin' on Slobs all through the month
Ducky hood, Palmer blocc and original pocket
Be pluggin' on off brands like a plug socket
Park Village, Santana and Mona Park
The ?come-up? is up to way
Puttin' a slug in a Snoop's heart
And by the way: Crippin' don't stop!
Cause them Front Street crips in Watts gots much props
Jordan downs, fushed town and P.J's
Two 1-11 N-HOOD is steady crippin' on them Avenues
Main Street, East Coasts and Rollin' 60 N-Hood
Is always crippin' and nuthin' on damn good
Two C's up to L-B-C
School yard shotgun and A-G-C
Shot outs to them 9-7 kitchens
And Original Crip sets
That I couldn't mention
Much Crip love, Blue Rag's outta here and I'm steady dippin'..
