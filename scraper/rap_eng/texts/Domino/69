Chorus: repeat 2X

One of them one 69
One of them one 69 (sixty-nine)
One of them one 69
One of them one 69 (sixty-nine)

[First Verse]
I like chocolate cakes
The fries with the shakes
Do anything to get'cha wet like a lake
Aphrodesiac like Xuxa
When I got some TLC, thick legs and coochie
Run in your daughter, don't tell Daddy
I wanna sex you up like Color Me Badd
So chicks throw out'cha booty I'mma warm it on up
I'll serve the cuts until she gets enough
Ten toes up, ten toes down
Doggystyle, like you'z a grayhound
Can I make you walk in the dark, on a table?
Lick you up, up and around, to your navel
Put the pressure on you and I ain't gone stop
Until it's like Rice Crispies, snap, crackle, and pop
Aw, until the rifleman shoots the gun
Sixty-nine ways to hit it, now choose one

Chorus

[Second Verse]
Well if I want it I'm gone hit, split it
So you won't forget it
Slick it, lick it
Trick it before I dick it
Nine, years comin' pound for pound
While I'm reachin' for your liver
You comin' like a river
And as your body quivers
I touch it so it shivers
Like Domino pizza, the diggady delivers
Put'cha glasses on cuz I want'cha to see
If I do you, then you gotta do me
So unlock your tongue, nibble on the kibble
Deep throat the goat, and the balls you could dribble
Ooh it feels great like frosted flakes
And if you into nutrition then taste the milk shake
And as I grit my teeth, it's goin' down
If you fine, then it's time for second round
And we can handle this from the dark to the sun
Sixty-nine ways to hit it, now choose one

Chorus

[Third Verse]
You heard of Doggystyle? Well I'mma do it Froggystyle
Bet'cha go buckwild, ooh
When I hit it like a highway
Past the speed limit, bumpin', yeah that's my way
Turn it on, make it hot, like a heat lamp
And slow it down, like I'm comin' off that off ramp
I know you feels that, sugar Daddy treats the meats
That meets the U.S.D.A. approval
And I pumps it like fuel
Unleaded, straight cope aestetic
Vegetarian beef with good credit
Give me the nuuke, nuuke
And the shuke, shuke
Taste the butterfinger and I'll eat the cookies
If you'z a ten, then you might need ice
To sit your ass in it when I'm done with the pipe
Stays in the rear, but I'm second to none
Sixty-nine ways to hit it now choose one

Chorus (2x)
