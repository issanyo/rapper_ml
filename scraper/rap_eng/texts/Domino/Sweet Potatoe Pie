[Intro]
It's like this
I'm that guy, you're so fly
Gotta get a piece of that sweet potato pie
I'm that guy, you're so fly
Gotta get a piece of that sweet potato pie

[Verse 1]
Now the way of today with the homies is straight
Gettin' fucked up off the dank, chronic
Bud, what, ever you wanna call it
And peace to you fuckin' alcoholics, for
Makin' the proper remedy
Cuz when I hit it, bitches envy me
Say you want wine? Yeah, I guess that's fine
But thai is the sky when you talkin' about mines
Now my thai got a friend named Gin
Got me all straight now my dick won't bend
Now I'm fucked for the rest of the night
Unless I find a piece of ass whether it's loose or tight
Now looka here looka here I done found a bitch
Yummy for the dick, Jelly mix in the switch
Save that shit cuz I don't wanna be your man
Just need a little loosin', do you understand?

[Hook (x2)]
My mind's fucked up off chocolate thai
Hit the gin shop now I'm so high
Now I need a bitch that's proper and fly
So break me off a piece of that sweet potato pie

[Verse 2]
Thinkin' about what I'm gonna do today
Party at my homies bout eight
I thought about goin' to the movies
But ain't nothin' like a bunch of proper ass hoochies
Dressed like a player can't wear nothin' less
Some simple ass shit, even if it ain't Guess
Take  a couple of shots and now I roll to the spot
Bitches straight peepin' wanna know what I got, well
One, two, three, Here comes the D
Pass me the buddah, OOOOH WEEE!!!!
And now I'm ready for you bitches
So gang a dick licker, do you get the picture?
And so much love for ya gals
And peace, love, and pussy to my muthafuckin' pals
And ay, yai, yai, I'mma stay high
And keep me a piece of that sweet potato pie

[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 3]
The fellas wanna have a barbecue tonight, I think it's on about five
They say it's gonna have plenty Daisy Dukes, and Les says it's gonna be live
So Imma gonna grab me a player suit, cuz ain't a damn thing changed
And now I'm proper and fly and shit, but man do I feel strange
So Imma go down to the liquor store, and find my friend named Gin
And go to the girl with the flyest thai, and break her off a proper twin
And now it's time to make some shit, and look for the proper mix
And run a little game on the PYT, and tell it to her somethin' like this

[Hook (x2)]
