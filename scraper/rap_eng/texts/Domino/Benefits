[Domino]
Yeah, the D-Diggady, plus the Domino
Show ya right, and uh, I ain't messin' with the broke
Just I ain't for the joke
You can't get with this if you ain't got no benefits
Trust that

Chorus: Domino (repeat 4X)

You can't get with this if you, ain't go no benefits

[Domino]
Papa got a brand new bag, for them fat heinies
With some shit for the nineties
No work no play, better yet
No work no pay, can you feel that?
I need a woman with her own, so when it hit twelve A.M
We callin' her place home
Cuz these broke ass bitches'll sex you fast
And in return they be lookin' to tax that ass
One thing that I know about the coochie is when you caught up
You ain't thinkin' what you bought up
Life kinda takes your mind high as a kite
But the ass got you more like a airplane flight
And some don't come down til' she finished shoppin'
Thing sittin' on swole, but steadily droppin'
Where my cash? Damn, sure don't need a mega tip
So this year I'm gone do it with the women, slick

Chorus

[Rodney O]
You can't get with none of this if you ain't got them benefits
So keep on walkin' and I won't even trip on it
Women always want the men with the cash
Won't even kick in for no food or gas
And what'cha mean you want the door opened for you?
And what'cha mean you wanna use my motorola?
Last time I checked you were as broke as a joke
Asked me for a little loan, I broke you off a note
But don't think that I'm missin' Mr. Benjamin
There's plenty more where that came from that I be swimmin' in
So don't worry about my life, my life
Cuz you could never be, my wife, my wife
No more rendevous on the lake night
I can't help that you don't know how to keep your game tight
Don't really mean for you to trip
Get'cha money, get'cha cash, get'cha benefits

Chorus

[Domino]
It's here, not to fight is a must
Get lost if you ain't workin' forty hours in a week plus
Can you say that you off welfare?
What about eighty percent off your health care?
Tryin' to get me with a WIC
Sportin' that Versace shit, but can't pay for the drink
I bet the last man bought that shit
Or the one before that just to know them boots
Broke ass trick
Runnin' to them clubs at the top of the night
Cuz your chips ain't right
So you better get your money on the gank
Instead of cashin' your checks at a bank
Ladies makin' that paper I will defend
Tricks ain't just women, they're also men
And money don't like no zeroes
So let your paper be your hero

Chorus 2X
