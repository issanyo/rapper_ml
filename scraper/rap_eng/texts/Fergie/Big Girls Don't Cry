Rachel:
Ladadada
The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
Mmh, be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

Kurt:
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

Blaine:
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life

Blaine (with Rachel):
It's time to be (a big girl now)

Blaine and Rachel:
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

Rachel:
The path that I'm walkin', I must go alone
I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full grown, full grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

Kurt:
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

Blaine and Rachel:
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Kurt:
Like the little school mate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and Uno cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be my valentine

Blaine and Kurt:
Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to

Blaine:
Cause I want to hold yours, too
We'll be playmates and lovers
And share our secret worlds

Rachel:
But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late, dark outside
I need to be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity, yeah

Kurt:
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

Blaine and Rachel:
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now

Blaine, Kurt, and Rachel:
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
