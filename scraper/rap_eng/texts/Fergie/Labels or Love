[Intro]
Shopping for labels, shopping for love
Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of
Shopping for labels, shopping for love
One, two
Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of
One, two, three
Turn the lights on

[Verse 1]
I already know what my addiction is
(I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love)
I shop for purses while love walks out the door
(Don't cry, buy a bag and get over it)
And, I'm not concerned with all the politics
(It's a lot of men, I know I could find another)
What I know is that I'm always happy
When I walk out the store, store
I'm guessing Supercalifragi-sexy
Nothing to be playing with
I love him, hate him, kiss him, diss him
Tryna to walk a mile in my kicks

[Chorus]
Love's like a runway, but which one do I love more?
No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior
Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for?
Let's stop chasing those boys and shop some more
One, two, one, two, three
Turn the lights on

[Verse 2]
I know I might come off as negative
(I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love)
Relationships are often so hard to tame
(A Prada dress has never broken my heart before)
And, ballin's something that I'm fed up with
(I'mma do the damn thing, watch me do the damn thing)
Cause I know that my credit card
Will help me put out the flames (Flames, flames)
I'm guessing Supercalifragi-sexy
Nothing to be playing with
I love him, hate him, kiss him, diss him
Tryna walk a mile in my kicks

[Chorus]
Love's like a runway, but which one do I love more?
No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior
Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for?
Let's stop chasing those boys and shop some more
One, two, one, two, three
Turn the lights on

[Bridge]
Gucci, Fendi, Prada purses, purchasing them finer things
Men, they come a dime a dozen
Just give me them diamond rings
I'm into a lot of bling, Cadillac, Chanel and Coach
Fellas boast, but they can't really handle my female approach
Buying things is hard to say
Rocking Christian Audigier
Manolo, Polo, taking photos in my Cartier
So we can't go all the way
I know you might hate it but
I'ma shop for labels
While them ladies lay and wait for love, oh!

[Chorus]
Love's like a runway, but which one do I love more?
No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior
Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for?
Let's stop chasing those boys and shop some more
One, two, one, two, three
Turn the lights on

[Outro]
Shopping for labels, shopping for love
Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of
Shopping for labels, shopping for love
One, two
Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of
One, two, three
Turn the lights on
