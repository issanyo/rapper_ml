[Verse 1]
I ain't saying it ain't beautiful, but it used to be
Who is this right here? She don't look like me
I was sleeping with the demon every night in my bedroom
I guess you are who you keep a reflection of me
That I don't wanna be, no

[Chorus]
Oops, look what you made me do
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Table set for two, look what you made me prove
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Just like you, just like you, ooh

[Verse 2]
I don't know if you remember what you did to me (oh)
'Cause I can't forget, I see it in my dreams
Iâ€™ve been living in a nightmare, all the shit you put me through (Yeah)
Tried to break me to pieces, it's a piece of my life that I don't really need, no

[Chorus]
Oops, look what you made me do
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Table set for two, look what you made me prove
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Just like you, just like you, ooh

[Bridge]
Gone girl, I don't ever wanna go back
Thought it was forever, you should know that
Haunted 'till I finally figure out your game, game
Take a picture in your mind, it's a throwback
Done twisting it up my life, you should roll that
Don't be trippin' on my shadow as I walk away-ay-ay

[Chorus]
Oops, look what you made me do
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Table set for two, look what you made me prove
I'm crazy just like you, I'm tainted just like you
Just like you, just like you, ooh

[Outro]

Belly of the beast, now let's have a feast
