I'm so happy you're here
It's been a long time since I've had you near my dear
Come on inside get away from the cold wind that's blowin
Gonna let you know,that

I'm so glad you're here
I worried about'ya
I'm so glad you're here
After all we've been through
I'm so glad you're here
It's good to see ya baby
I'm so glad you're here

Leave your troubles out
Yeah they come to mind every time I see you around town
Be frontin like ya got it all together
But I'm no better
Baby it's you and I forever

[Chorus]
Woah love, ain't nothin' changed
We're still hopeless together
Woah,-oh
I wish you were goin, for I'm doomed if you stay
It's okay
I need you anyways
It's okay
Yeah yeah
It's okay
And I need you, Anyway
And I'm so happy you're here

I'm so glad you're here
I'm so glad you're here
Together
I'm so glad you're here
I'm so glad you're here
