[Intro: Soulja Boy & Fergie]
You know you've been on my mind (Yeah)
It's like I can't stop thinking about you
You know, whenever I'm around you, I get clumsy, that's right
But right about now, I wanna get rough
REMIX!
Fergie Ferg! (Oh, baby)
Soulja Boy! (Oh, baby)
Collipark! (Oh, baby)
(Oh, baby) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Fergie]
First time that I saw your eyes
Boy, you looked right through me, mmm, mmm
Played it cool, but I knew you knew
That cupid hit me, mmm, mmm

[Chorus: Fergie]
You got me trippin' (oh), stumblin' (oh), flippin' (oh), fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in - in, love - love)
You got me slippin' (oh), tumblin' (oh), sinkin' (oh), crumblin'
So clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in - in, love - love)
So in love with you

[Verse 2: Fergie]
Can't breathe, when you touch my sleeve
Butterflies so crazy, mmm, mmm
Whoa now, think I'm goin' down
Friends don't know what's with me, mmm, mmm

[Chorus: Fergie]
You got me trippin' (oh), stumblin' (oh), flippin' (oh), fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in - in, love - love)
You got me slippin' (oh), tumblin' (oh), sinkin' (oh), crumblin'
So clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in - in, love - love)
So in love with you
