[Chorus: Fergie]
Life's a movie, let the camera roll
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow
That's right, baby, you already know
You already know, hope you're ready
Ready, steady, steady, rocking

[Verse 1: Dyan Bxnks]
When I step in the room all you bitches wanna play with me
But they just wanna blame me
All these bitches wanna get what I’m getting
And they are weak like spaghettis
Now listen, all these bitches who wanna come for me
But they don’t know what the fuck I am and what it means
So when this bitches try to get me, they just get the T
Why I am still so fav and they like like a trash bag
Hmmm … let me think about it
They’re jelous of my butt and the money pouring all around my body
And then I’ll be around slappin hoes with a stack of Benjis
And ill be dancing in my Saks Fifth avenue jeans
Dam I’m feelin kinda tipsy, all you niggas want me, But you never gonna get me
Try to steal my shine, but you will never gonna beat me
And you can buy a house, but you will never gonna kiss me

[Chorus: Fergie]
Life's a movie, let the camera roll
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow
That's right, baby, you already know
You already know, hope you're ready
Ready, steady, steady, rocking

[Post-Chorus: Fergie]
This is how I do, this is how I do
This is how I do, this is how I do

[Verse 2: Yini Store]
Ayo, Let it go, Let's go
Store will be the next go
I'll kill them like Yini James Bond
Big Thing but ain't talking about my ill flow
Bitches wanna fuck but they can't get a good wig though
They like, uh, it's a N.Smalls!
I got hoes making hips cause they wanna looks like N Bo'n
I made it 4 shows in man mode
And now i got all this bitches waiting other with a heels on
Dawn, they ain't see young Yini in a year
One night where leave bitches in a Chair
I just wanna be the besttie in some years
And i give a fuck my problem with the "rrrrr"
I'm tall and pretty, the colombian Angeline
I'm gettin' some boyz for my list of the year
I'm riding couple of'em and making this song though
Im with pretty girls, hey Dyan we're been the best through

[Chorus: Fergie]
Life's a movie, let the camera roll
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow
That's right, baby, you already know
You already know, hope you're ready
Ready, steady, steady, rocking

[Post-Chorus: Fergie]
This is how I do, this is how I do
This is how I do, this is how I do

Verse 3:
Walking down, in the downtown, to the street
Feeling like a ten, niggas all over me
If you see me you can tell that I'm not ashamed
From the way I look, I can't feel the pain
If u see me, you can look but you can't touch
From the head to the toe, bitch I’m a fucking crush
Navigating in ur goddamm imagination
You can feel it, I'm in all your nastiest creations
Just for the record, I'm a bomb bitch, a legacy
Nasty bitch in the streets, im a fantasy
Niggas put me in da box, and say im crazy
But u already know bitch, im slayzy
I said watch me, I said watch me when I drop it
Lyrically better, my lines are headers, and when you see me, I'm always ghetto
And all my bitches, rocking skinny
My bitches pretty, wuss good gurl Yini!! (We the best bitch, hahah)

[Bridge: Fergie]
You didn't know I could drop it like that, did you?
You didn't know I could drop it like that, did you?

[Chorus: Fergie]
Life's a movie, let the camera roll
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow
That's right, baby, you already know
You already know, hope you're ready
Ready, steady, steady, rocking

This is how I do, this is how I do
This is how I do, (yeah) this is how I do (yeah)
This is how I do, this is how I do
This is how I do, this is how I do
