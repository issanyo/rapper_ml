I tell truth even when I lie
Take a deep look in my eyes
All you know and see is fine
Lets wake up the world, let ride, dale
Wake me up in the morning
Slow me down in the evening
Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive
Wake me up in the morning
Slow me down in the evening
Get me whatever you want to
Make me feel alive
Im so 3000 and great, theyre
So 2000 and hate
They want me to fall and fail
Hurry up and wait, im a pyscho on a beat
Norman bates, im on that bally, it's as wet as the five great lakes, break
Five, six, seven, eight, im some like a pimp, when I put my words on a track, slap
Hustle, hustle, hard, grind, im known for that, slap
Hustler, business, manager, and
Now hes a business man
That chico got more flips than
Gymnist man
Who is the man? chip chip bang
Wake me up in the morning
Slow me down in the evening
Get me whatever you want to
Make me feel alive
Wake me up in the morning
Slow me down in the evening
Get me whatever you want to make me feel alive
Lets get it like it, automatic
Space invader, dancfloor operator
Supersonic, elevator, next level, upgrader
Take you higher, margin later, right now not later
I feel alive baby, I feel alive in
This club
I feel alive baby, I feel alive in
This club
I feel alive baby, I feel alive in
This club
I feel alive, feel alive
Wake me up in the morning
Slow me down in the evening
Get me whatever you want to
Make me feel alive
Wake me up in the morning
Slow me down in the evening
Get me whatever you want to
Make me feel alive
I be going faster, and faster
Better make it last, make it last
Yeah
I be going faster, and faster
Better make it last, make it last
Now baby
Wake me up in the morning
Slow me down in the evening
Get me whatever you want to
Make me feel alive
Wake me up in the morning
Slow me down in the evening
Get me whatever you want to
Make me feel alive
I feel alive baby
I feel alive baby
I feel alive baby now I feel great
