[Verse 1]
All these vibes, so blasé blasé blah
I need your high, c’mon c’mon c’mon
My throat is dry, come pour some more, some more
When we lock eyes, I’m yours, I’m yours, I’m yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, your body got these moves, your body
Ooh, your body, higher
Ooh your body, yeah, I know it wants me
Ooh, your body, is blowing my mind, cause

[Chorus]
All this tension that we can’t control
Got me catching feelings on my dance floor
Ooh, damn, I’m hoping that we take it home
Got me catching feelings on the dance floor
All this tension that we can’t control
Got me catching feelings on my dance floor
Ooh, damn, I’m hoping that we take it home
Got me catching feelings on the dance floor

[Verse 2]
Ain’t gonna lie, you got me open wide
The way you move is setting me on fire
My throat is sore, come pour some more, some more
You’re all mine, I'm yours, I’m yours, I’m yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, your body got these moves, your body
Ooh, your body, higher
Ooh your body, yeah, I know it wants me
Ooh, your body, is blowing my mind, cause

[Chorus]
All this tension that we can’t control
Got me catching feelings on my dance floor
Ooh, damn, I’m hoping that we take it home
Got me catching feelings on the dance floor

[Verse 3]
So forget this distance, come and pull me tight
Can you feel this tension? We could go all night
We could get it started, make it radiant
I’m gonna call you daddy when you make me sweat

[Bridge]
And you know like I know
I’m getting you alone, I’m getting you alone
And you know like I know
I’m bout to take you home, I’m bout to take you home, cause

[Chorus]
All this tension that we can’t control
Got me catching feelings on my dance floor
Ooh, damn, I’m hoping that we take it home
Got me catching feelings on the dance floor
All this tension that we can’t control
Got me catching feelings on my dance floor
Ooh, damn, I’m hoping that we take it home
Got me catching feelings on the dance floor
