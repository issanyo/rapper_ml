[Spoken Intro]
So you little Italian devils, you want to know about love?
Saraghina will tell you. If you want to make a woman happy
You rely on what you're born with, because it is in your blood!

Be Italian
Be Italian
Take a chance and try to steal a fiery kiss
Be Italian
Be Italian
When you hold me don't just hold me but hold this
Please be gentle, sentimental
Go ahead and try to give my cheek a pat
But be daring and uncaring
When you pinch me try to pinch me where there's fat
HA!
Be a singer be a lover
Pick the flower now before the chance is past
Be Italian
Be Italian
Live today as if it may become your last!

Hey!
Be a singer be a lover
Pick the flower now before the chance is past
Be Italian
Be Italian
Live today as if it may become your last!
