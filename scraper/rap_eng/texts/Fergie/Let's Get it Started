[Intro: Fergie & apl.de.ap]
Let's get it started in here
And the bass keeps runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin'
And runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin'
And runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin, and runnin', runnin'
And

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
In this context, there's no disrespect
So when I bust my rhyme, you break ya necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect and let the rhythm effect
To lose your inhibition follow your intuition
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition
'Cause when we be out, girlies pull they weave out
You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out
Burnin' 'til it's burned out, turn it 'til it's turned out
Act up from North West East South

[Pre-Hook: Fergie, will.i.am, apl.de.ap & Taboo]
Everybody (yeah), everybody (yeah), just get into it (yeah), get stupid (come on)
Get it started, (come on) get it started (yeah), get it started

[Hook: Fergie, will.i.am, apl.de.ap & Taboo]
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Yeah

[Verse 2: Taboo]
Lose control, up outta your soul
Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow
Don't get ahead, just jump into it
Y'all hear about it, the Peas will do it
Get started, get stupid
Don't worry about it, people will walk you through it
Step by step like you're into New Kid
Inch by inch with the new solution
Transmit hits with no delusion
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we move it

[Pre-Hook: Fergie, will.i.am, apl.de.ap & Taboo]
Everybody (yeah), everybody (yeah), just get into it (yeah), get stupid (come on)
Get it started, (come on) get it started (yeah), get it started

[Hook: Fergie, will.i.am, apl.de.ap & Taboo]
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Yeah

[Bridge: Fergie, will.i.am, apl.de.ap & Taboo]
Runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin'
C'mon y'all, let's get (coo-koo), uh huh, let's get (coo-koo) in here
Wild out, get (coo-koo), uh huh, let's get (coo-koo) in here
Wild out, get (coo-koo), uh huh, let's get (coo-koo) in here
Ohh ohh ohh, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
Let's get ill, that's the deal
Ap the gate, and Will bring the thugged out drill (just)
Lose your mind, this is the time
Y'all can't stand still, trust and bang your spine (just)
Bob your head like me, apl.de
Up inside the club or in your Bentley
Get messy, loud and sick
You mind pass normal or another head trip
So, come them now, do not correct it
Let's get ignorant, let's get hectic

[Pre-Hook: Fergie, will.i.am, apl.de.ap & Taboo]
Everybody (yeah), everybody (yeah), just get into it (yeah), get stupid (come on)
Get it started, (come on) get it started (yeah), get it started

[Hook: Fergie, will.i.am, apl.de.ap & Taboo]
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Let's get it started (ha), let's get it started (in here)
Yeah

[Bridge: Fergie, will.i.am, apl.de.ap & Taboo]
Get (coo-koo), uh huh, we (coo-koo) in here
Let's get (coo-koo), uh huh, we (coo-koo) in here

[Outro: apl.de.ap]
