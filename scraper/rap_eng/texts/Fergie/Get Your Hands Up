[Chorus: Fergie]
Hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up

[Verse 1: apl.de.ap]
Brothers in the place, put your hands up in the air
We wild'n out
Bringin' the ruckus and musical warfare
Put 'em up and go bananas, my spinning everywhere
We waiting for the hot shit blazing right here
That's the place, come on
Smash it up, come on
This is the get-up, so bounce around, come on
Queen of the Dutchess, lady of the year
Fergie Ferg, wants ya to put your hands up in the air

[Pre-Chorus: Fergie]
If you like what you see, won't you do, do this for me? Oh

[Chorus: Fergie]
Hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
Hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up

[Verse 2: Fergie]
And now why you taking a break when I'm ready?
And why you gotta be so pathetic?
We can't do nothing, you're too hazy
Don't you know that I like aggressive?
You gotta be like the Peas and just rock it
If you wan' lock it, down you gotta jock it
Get on the floor, get closer to watch it
Get off the wall and hands out your pockets

[Pre-Chorus: Fergie]
If you like what you see, won't you do, do this for me? Oh

[Chorus: Fergie]
Hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
Hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up

[Verse 3: Taboo]
And this is it, what?
Gucci falling from the sky
Let's get rich, what?
Money staked to the walls, we some rich fucks
Throw your hands up in the sky
Put your fist up, uh, put your fist up
And we drive big trucks and make big bucks
I get my party on down with some big butts
I rock some fresh shoes, so I can blaze it up
And make some new hot tunes, so you could raise it up
Come on!

[Verse 4: will.i.am]
Put your hands in the air, your palms in the air
You models in the motherfucking atmosphere
Wiggle all around like you just don't give a fuck
Baby, if you got a big booty, then give it up
Bottle full of bubbly and we gon' live it up
Lady lookin' lovely and I just wanna hit 'em up
Lay 'em down, drill 'em up, fill 'em up
They love it when I and hug 'em up (Don't stop)

[Verse 5: will.i.am]
Okay, I won't then
You know how we rock, we rock coast to coast and
L.A. to top, they rockin' Austin
Compens to back to Compton (Don't Stop!)
Okay, I won't quit
Will.i.am, I stay, uh, I stay on and
Get your hands in the air where they belong
The noise gon flip, flippin' the song

[Interlude: apl.de.ap, Taboo, will.i.am]
Don't Stop, pump louder!
We [?], right?
Know it, just don't stop, get up
Till your body drops, get your

[Chorus: Fergie]
Hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
Hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
Throw your hands up, get your hands up
