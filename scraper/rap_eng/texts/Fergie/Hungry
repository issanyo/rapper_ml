[Intro: Rick Ross & Fergie]
This special, biggest, global
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Fergie]
To say it's complicated, understatement of the year
Well maybe conflict made it the new flavor in your ear
They know that I'm a problem, that's why everybody scared
Whatever doesn't kill you, can make you an ill-ionaire
Uh, just turn the headphones up or make the windows roll up
I make they hands go up
When I show up and I blow it 'til I'm full up, wait, hold up
Girl up in the mirror, only one I fear, uh
You say you the realest, I told you I'm the illest

[Chorus: Fergie]
Sick, sick, mmm
Hungry, starving
Not thirsty, just hungry
Ambitious, still hungry
Still hungry

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm moonwalking on marble floors
Rick Ross, I'm just drippin' sauce
Bitches see me and they all just wave
Rolls Royce and we call this Wraith
I fuck up money like I'm Escobar
Ballin', ballin', Kobe Bryant, that boy living large
No room for medium, that means you thinkin' small
Ferrari, Fergie, switching gears, she rockin' with a boss
I close my eyes, I must be telepathic
Look over haters, tripling my assets
It takes courage to accomplish these things
Fergie's my queen, I'm the king, now come kiss on our rings

[Chorus: Fergie & Rick Ross]
Sick, sick, mmm
Hungry
El Chapo
Starving
Rinzel
Not thirsty, just hungry
Ferrari Fergie
Ambitious, still hungry
Still hungry
