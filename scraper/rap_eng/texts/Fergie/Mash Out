[Intro: will.i.am]
Hold it now, hold it now, (what what?) hold it now
Hold it now, hold it now, (oh what?) hold it now
Hold it now, hold it now, (what what?) hold it now
Hold it now, hold it now, (oh what?) word

[Fergie]
This is how we roll, when we mash out
There's no time for tantrum
{"This dance is on and on and on and-" <- Milk Dee {2X}}

[MC Lyte]
Yeah, I, am, that fly girl
Can't deny girl, nothin I won't try one type of girl
Well maybe not coke, cause I'm dope already
Lyrics sharp like dart and cut like machetes
And I'm rockin the shit steady
Like no doubt, the show's sold out
They know how I rolled in when I rolled out
Black Eyed Pea, L-Y-T
Slide through them bars, leave the track greasy
It's easy, I flow through the beat breezy
Hate, they used to tease me, now they wanna be me
Lyte's in the building, of course I'm back
Get that booty stuck like a cul-de-sac
I'm the all knowing like the almanac
And though your boy keep callin, I ain't callin him back
Uh-uh

[Chorus: Fergie]
This is how we roll, when we mash out
There's no time for tantrum
Only time of dancin, it's the party anthem
I call Lyte so we could mash out
I swooped her up and then we mashed out
We stepped in the club to turn the party out
I took some flicks and poked my ass out
This is how we roll, when we mash out
There's no time for tantrum
{"This dance is on and on and on and-" <- Milk Dee {2X}}

[Fergie]
Fergie Ferg from the burbs, keepin shit flyer than birds
Concierge, valet, pulls my ride up to the curb
I step in the door, I said it, so listen
Me and MC Lyte takin you out on a mission
Like a space shuttle, me and my girls huddle
Get back to the crib, bathtubs filled with bubble
Champagne, caviar, for Hollywood rock stars
Back on the road, them mess with {?} bar
F-E-R, G-I, E
F-E-R, to the, G

[will.i.am]
Fergie Ferg rock hard most definitely
On the M-I, C with L-Y-T

[Chorus: Fergie]
I call Lyte so we could mash out
I swooped her up and then we mashed out
We stepped in the club to turn the party out
I took some flicks and poked my ass out
This is how we roll, when we mash out
There's no time for tantrum
Only time of dancin', it's the party anthem

[will.i.am]
Hold it now, hold it now, (what what?) hold it now
Hold it now, hold it now, (oh what?) hold it now
Hold it now, hold it now, (what what?) hold it now
Hold it now, hold it now, (oh what?) word
To all the cool chickens, center stage on the mic
We puttin it on wax, it's the NEEEEEW STYLE~!
Four and three and two and one
And when I'm on the mic, the honies come
I shoot the shit without a gun
The rhymes I rock are more than +Action+
Nothin but that, that satisfaction
Action-packed like Action Jackson
Stand back cat, here come that blastin
Blastin from no other than will.i.am

[Outro: Fergie]
This is how we roll, when we mash out
There's no time for tantrum
{"This dance is on and on and on and-" <- Milk Dee {2X}}
