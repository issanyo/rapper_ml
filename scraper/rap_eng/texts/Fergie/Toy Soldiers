[Intro]
Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
It wasn't my intention to mislead you
It never should have been this way
What can I say?
It's true
I did extend the invitation
I never knew how long you'd stay
When you hear temptation call
It's your heart that takes
Takes the fall
(Won't you come out and play with me?)

[Chorus]
Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers

Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
It's getting hard to wake up in the morning
My head is spinning constantly
How can it be?
How could I be so blind to this addiction?
If I don't stop
The next one's gonna be me
Only emptiness remains
It replaces all
All the pain
(Won't you come out and play with me?)

[Chorus]
Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers

Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers
(We never win)

[Bridge]
Only emptiness remains
It replaces all
All the pain
(Won't you come out and play with me?)

[Chorus]
Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers

Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Outro]
Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers

Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers
