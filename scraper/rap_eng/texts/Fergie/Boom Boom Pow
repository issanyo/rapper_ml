[Intro]
Gotta get that

[Bridge]
I like that boom boom pow
Them chickens jacking my style
They try to copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so three thousand and eight
You so two thousand and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now

[Hook]
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
Gotta get that boom boom boom
Boom boom boom
That boom boom boom

[Verse 1]
Yo, I got that hit to beat the block
You can get that bass on the low
I got that rock 'n roll, that future flow
That digital spit, next level visual shit
I got that boom boom boom
That boom boom boom

[Breakdown]
People in the place
If you wanna get down
Put your hands in the air
Bob-oh-bee, drop the beat now!

[Verse 2]
Here we go, here we go, satellite radio
Y'all gettin' hit with the boom boom
Beats so big, I'm stepping on leprechauns
Shitting on y'all with the boom boom
Shitting on y'all with the boom boom
Shitting on y'all with the boom boom
Shitting on y'all with the boom boom boom
