A hard cut to Tammy’s car on the side of the highway. We can hear her attempting to start it to no avail. 5 yards from her car we can see the “Military Base” sign that we saw earlier.

Tammy: (asking herself)
Now what?

Radio DJ:
Dedicated to our own Jungle Julia, in loving memory.

Tammy turns the radio off. The camera drops to her phone, which has a text message, she attempts to check it but she gets no service, she puts the phone into her pocket. A quick cut to her opening the hood of her car, she touches the radiator cap which was overheating before.

Tammy: (to herself)
It’s not the radiator. Damnit.

She reaches into the car and gets her coat. She hears something in the dark and begins to look around. She closes the car door and begins hastily walking towards the Military Base.

Tammy: (hitting her flashlight)
Alright. Fuckin’ thing. Cheap (loses her footing briefly) - whoa! Damn light.

Car lights appear behind Tammy, she hears it and turns around waving her arms to attempt to flag it down. The car passes her without slowing down.

Tammy: (yelling at the car)
Hey! Bastard! Bastard!

Tammy turns around, more noises can be heard around her, she is startled. More car lights begin approaching from the same direction. Again she attempts to flag the car down. The car is moving quickly, she runs towards it with her arms up - the car honks its horn as a warning and continues speeding along, swerving at the last second to avoid hitting Tammy. Tammy falls to the ground and the car drives away.

Driver:
Get out of the fuckin’ road bitch!

Tammy is lying face down on the road and her flashlight is intermittently flashing onto her face. More noises can be heard surrounding her. She reaches out for her flashlight but ends up pushing it away from her. A third car can now be seen coming. Tammy gets up and now stands in the middle of the road waving her arms.

Tammy:
Stop! Stop! Please stop!

Immediately after the car passes her, something tackles her to the ground, snarling. Tammy can be heard screaming. Camera watches another car drive by then pans to the side of the road where Tammy is being ripped apart in the shadows. More car lights appear, it’s Wray’s tow truck. Wray drives by with Cherry inside, both looking out into the shadows where Tammy and the mutants are. The camera cuts to the inside of Wray’s cab.

Cherry:
What the hell was that?

Wray:
People picking up road kill.

Cherry:
What, like an armadillo?

Wray:
Deer… See a lot of them around here.

Camera shows a few deer on the side of the road as Wray continues driving.

Wray:
You know, I read a statistic that said that the eating of venison has risen 30% in the last few years. 60% of that’s from road kill.

Cherry:
People eat road kill?

Wray:
If you’re driving out here at 70 miles an hour and a deer darts out in front of you, if you blink or brake or swerve, shit, you’ll just kill yourself.

Cherry:
So, what do you do?

Wray:
Just pick ‘em off… (Wray slams his fist into his palm) just like this. Send it flying away from you.

Cherry:
Unacceptable.

Wray:
Not really. It’s just a clear case of you or him.

Cherry:
Or her.

As Cherry is saying that, Wray moves his eyes back to the road and sees something, he shouts and immediately swerves out of the way. He loses control of the truck and it begins to flip over onto the side of the road. The camera moves into the cab of the truck to show Cherry and Wray both alive, Wray having a wound on his left temple, bleeding.
