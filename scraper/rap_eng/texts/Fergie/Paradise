[Verse 1]
Lately, I don't know, but something's coming over me
Thoughts of stirring up 'bout stirring up a drink or three
I'm down to go, where the wind blows
So come and follow, Don't wanna leave ya, babe
Leave ya, babe
So please, baby

[Chorus]
We could fly
Up, up, up, up high
Blue sky
Up, up, up, up high
Feel the high
Come and take ride
Above the stars, we're going far

[Chorus]
If you wanted to have a party
Come on everybody, put down your latte
Throw your work aside and come to
Paradise
No frustration on this vacation
This destination, this correlation
No consolation, only sensation
Paradise

[Verse 2]
Where the water is so clear That you can see your feet
Dropping coins In my nature by the coral reef
In every natural treasures From mother nature
We are so wealthy now, wealthy now
Tell me now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Say goodbye
Buh, buh, buh, buh-bye
To all the tries
Buh, buh, buh, buh-bye
Relax your mind
Open up a wine
And then explore
I'll show you more

[Chorus]
If you wanted to have a party
Come on everybody, put down your latte
Throw your work aside and come to
Paradise
No frustration on this vacation
This destination, this correlation
No consolation, only sensation
Paradise

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
If you wanted to have a party
Come on everybody, put down your latte
Throw your work aside and come to
Paradise
No frustration on this vacation
This destination, this correlation
No consolation, only sensation
Paradise

If you wanted to have a party
Come on everybody, put down your latte
Throw your work aside and come to
Paradise
No frustration on this vacation
This destination, this correlation
No consolation, only sensation
Paradise
