The road in which Abby swerves on has an underpass, which is where the camera takes us. A car is smoking and driving towards a building with a sign that reads “The Bone Shack”. Tammy pulls up to a water pump and opens the hood up from her overheating car.

JT:
Get that thing away from my pump!

Tammy: (proceeds to fill up a bucket with JT’s water pump)
It’s just overheating. Need to get to town.
It’s just a stripped radiator cap. Water leaks when it heats up. (pours water into radiator)
No pressure.

Cherry walks by limping and holding her leg as Tammy is tending to her overheating vehicle

Tammy:
You okay?

Cherry: (walking up stairs towards the restaurant)
I’m just cherry.

JT: (walking down the stairs with a gallon of water)
Go on and have a seat anywhere, I’ll be right in.
Here, take this with you.

Tammy:
Natural good spring water.

JT:
Ain’t nothin’ good about it, bottled it myself. Get it right there out of the dam. (points behind him to a water dam)

Tammy: (shuts car hood and looks at the gallon of water with JT’s logo)
Thanks… JT.

JT:
We’re servin’ inside tonight. Best barbeque in Texas ‘round the clock.

Tammy:
I’ve gotta go.

JT:
Savin’ lives are ya?

Tammy: (now in her car, looking out the window)
Now how did you know that?

Tammy starts her car up and pulls away, JT is now only holding his bucket of sauce that he’s had this entire time.

JT:
Now that’s a rump roast.

JT pulls a wooden spoon from his bucket of BBQ sauce and gives it a taste, giving a face of displeasure.
