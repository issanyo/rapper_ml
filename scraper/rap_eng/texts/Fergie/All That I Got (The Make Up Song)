[​Verse 1: Fergie]
Baby, baby when you're lookin' deep in my eyes
I know you're seeing past my makeup
Into the little girl that used to hide out and cry
When her parents fought, trying to be strong

[Pre-Chorus 1: Fergie]
You can see the hurt in me
The cover ups so secretly
And all that I aspire to be
You see, you see
You know who I really am
No entourage, or caravan
Do you even give a damn?
About all that, now tell me

[Chorus: Fergie]
Would you love me
If I didn't work out or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got

[​Verse 2: Fergie]
So, I don't mean to scare you now or push you away
'Cause I'm not tryna rush anything
But when I look into your eyes
I'm not scared to say I see little you
I'm in the picture too

[Pre-Chorus 2: Fergie]
Like a happy family tree
We're together constantly
This could be eventually
We'll see, we'll see
But all that I have got to know
Is with me, baby, will you grow?
Through sun and rain and heavy snow
Oh, tell me so, now baby

[Chorus: Fergie]
Would you love me
If I didn't work out or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got

[Bridge: will.i.am]
It's as simple as one and two, I'm in love with you
And three and four, you're all I adore
To the seven and eight
See, I've been making mistakes
'Cause when you're on my mind, I just can't think straight
Back to the five and six, I'm all in your mix
And I'm all into you, without the lipstick
Without the L'Oreal
You remain the same angel that I fell for
For real, for real

[Chorus: Fergie]
Would you love me
If I didn't work out or I didn't change my natural hair?
(No, no, no, no)
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby (baby)
I'll give you all that I got (ooh, no)

[Outro: Fergie]
(Could you love me?)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, whoa
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Could you love me?)
I'll give you all that I got
(Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
Hey, yeah
Don't let our love end
