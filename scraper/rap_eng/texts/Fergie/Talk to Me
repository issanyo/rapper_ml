Talk to me
Talk to me
Talk to me tonight about love

Hey, now
Just what are we feeling
Is this more than attraction that we both are dealing with?
And is it in the cards that we stay together
I recognize the odds against it lasting forever

There's a message that you're sending
I can see it in your eyes
But I don't know what you're thinking
I can't read your heart or mind

Come with me
We'll make tonight a fantasy (Tonight a fantasy)
If you say the word
I'll take you on a journey

Talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind
Talk to me
What are you feeling inside?
Talk to me
What are you thinking of?

Talk to me tonight about love
Come and talk to me, my baby
Come and talk to me

Oh, hold me right up against you
Cause when you groove up close to me
I'm feeling the rhythm
Just whisper in my ear
What's going on inside you
I just wanna hear if you're feeling like I do

Open up your heart
There's nothing I want more
Show me the light
And tell me what you came here for

Don't keep it yourself
Just improvise
(Just improvice)
Lose yourself
Tell what you're feeling inside

Talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind
Talk to me
What are you feeling inside?
Talk to me
What are you thinking of?

Talk to me tonight about love
Come and talk to me, my baby
Come and talk to me

There's a message that you're sending
I can see it in your eyes
But I don't know what you're thinking
I can't read your heart or mind

If you wanna make tonight a fantasy
Just say the word
I'll take you on a journey

Talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind
Talk to me
What are you feeling inside?
Talk to me
What are you thinking of?

Talk to me tonight about love
Come and talk to me, my baby
Come and talk to me
