[Intro: will.i.am]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Fergie & will.i.am]
Ain't nobody rocking like this (No)
Ain't nobody out there swift like this (No)
Everywhere I go all I hear is this (You're alright)
Yes, I must confess
And it's true we keeps it fresh (Yeah)
Cause keeping it fresh is my main interest (Yeah)
Just staying consistent, flipping them hits (You're alright)
Can't hate on this

[Pre-Chorus 1: Fergie]
So hate if you wanna, wanna
Cause that ain't gon' make me wanna
Go stop what I'm doing to you
'Cause my beat go boom, boom
In the club, they be jumping, jumping
To the bass that's like pumping, pumping
And the girls like the speakers thumping
'Cause I told them to shake their humps, oh

[Chorus: Fergie]
In any minute, I'll be rolling through
So get ready, so get ready
And in a minute I'll be coming through
So get ready, so get ready
'Cause here I come, get ready, 'cause here I come
I'm coming for you, baby (Get ready, 'cause here I come)
Taking you higher now (Get ready, 'cause here I come)
Get ready, 'cause here I come

[Verse 2: Fergie & will.i.am]
Ain't nobody ripping like me (No)
F to the E-R-G-I-E (Yeah)
I rock it hardcore for my fly ladies (You're alright)
I rock it, yes, indeed
I represent Los Angeles city (Hey)
Hacienda Heights is the vicinity (Yeah)
The old school homies still rolling with me (You're alright)
Money don't change me

[Pre-Chorus 2: Fergie]
So hate if you gotta, gotta
Cause I got a lot-a, lot-a
Fans that will holla, holla
I'm making it hot, hot
In the club they be jumping, jumping
To the bass that's like pumping, pumping
And the girls like the speakers thumping
'Cause I told them to shake their humps, oh

[Chorus: Fergie]
In any minute, I'll be rolling through
So get ready, so get ready
And in a minute I'll be coming through
So get ready, so get ready
'Cause here I come, get ready, 'cause here I come
I'm coming for you, baby (Get ready, 'cause here I come)
Taking you higher now (Get ready, 'cause here I come)
Get ready, 'cause here I come

[Verse 3: Will.i.am]
Will.i.am stepping in just like a gentleman
Dressed to impress, just to mess with them feminines
Buy you Long Island, but my name ain't Gilligan
If I get you tipsy, do you mind if I'm feeling 'em?
How you doing? Yeah, yeah
What's the dilly? You can call me Willy
Or call me Billy
You can call me whatever you like, no, really
Just don't call me up 'cause I got a milli
Young dollars in the bank, gotta be frank
Captain Hook chicks quick to make you walk the plank
Pirates of the Caribbean, I ain't being
Robbed for my dividends for not seeing it coming
I keep moving and running, I keep shooting and gunning
I'm holding it down, I ain't fooling around
Will.i.am bring the heat in your town

[Chorus: Fergie]
In any minute, I'll be rolling through
So get ready, so get ready
And in a minute I'll be coming through
So get ready, so get ready
'Cause here I come, get ready, 'cause here I come
I'm coming for you, baby (Get ready, 'cause here I come)
Taking you higher now (Get ready, 'cause here I come)
Get ready, 'cause here I come
