[Verse 1: Fergie]
When I wear my Mary Jane shoes
I can escape from the blues
The whole world seems a little bit brighter, brighter (Brighter)
My heavy steps get a little bit lighter, lighter

[Chorus: Fergie]
Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's

[Verse 2: Fergie]
When I wear my Mary Jane shoes
I'm just like a child underoos (Underoos, underoos)
From heart and my soles, I feel like I'm seven (Oh, oh, say)
From my head to my toes it's like I'm in heaven, heaven

[Chorus: Fergie]
Whoa, my Mary Jane's (Yeah)
Whoa, my Mary Jane's (Whoa now, oh now)
Whoa, my Mary Jane's (Yeah)
Whoa, my Mary Jane's (Whoa now, oh now)

[Verse 3: Fergie]
When I wear Mary Jane shoes
I enjoy to spin the one's and two's
Music has another dimension
And I can dance with a different perception, whoa

[Chorus: Fergie]
Whoa, my Mary Jane's (Yeah)
Whoa, my Mary Jane's (Whoa now, oh now)
Whoa, my Mary Jane's (Yeah)
Whoa, my Mary Jane's (Whoa now, oh now)

[Bridge: Fergie]
When I step into my shoes, make the lady wanna (Hey)
Feeling high, feeling low, it's caught up in the bubble (Hey)
Everything is beautiful, motherfucking, really great
When I step into my shoes, make a lady wanna go crazy
Wanna go crazy (Crazy motherfucker)
Wanna go crazy
Wanna go crazy

[Chorus: Fergie]
Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's

[Scatting Outro: Fergie]
