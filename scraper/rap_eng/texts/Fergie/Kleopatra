[Intro]
It's hot, go off
Lights, show off
Shut up, pose
Show off, show off, show off
Shut up, pose

[Chorus]
You can come lay where the lives die, all covered in gold
Kleopatra
Kleopatra
Kleopatra
Kleopatra
Kleopatra

[Verse 1]
Well this'll escalate, elevate
You and me, you and me
I step right out that tomb style
I'm 'bout to walk that golden mile
Dress in compliments, my confidence is on another level, level, level
Waited a while until the screams kept getting louder
'Till the dreams woke up the power of the rebel, rebel, rebel

[Chorus]
You can come lay where the lives die, all covered in gold
Kleopatra
Kleopatra
Kleopatra
Kleopatra
Kleopatra

[Verse 2]
My swag is BC, watch my hips, my walk is beastly
Cleo, but I'm 3016, keep my hair 100 karat gold
Please believe me, royalty is the way I'm fleeting
You set the goal and I'll achieve it
Just 'cause I got it don't mean I don't want more

[Chorus]
You can come lay where the lives die, all covered in gold
Kleopatra
Kleopatra
Kleopatra
Kleopatra
Kleopatra

[Outro]
You think you know me, but you don't know
You think I've had nothing but easy roads
If I could show you the map to my soul
You would probably say I'm crazy
Been hungry and angry and lonely and tired
I've been through the trenches, I've walked through the fire
We all will fall and rise up again to the call
