When You Were Young And Your Heart Was An Open Book
You Used To Say Live And Let Live
(You Know You Did, You Know You Did You Know You Did)
But In This Ever Changing World In Which We Live In
Makes You Give In And Cry
Say Live And Let Die
Live And Let Die
Live And Let Die
Live And Let Die
What Does It Matter To Ya
When You Got A Job To Do
You Gotta Do It Well
You Gotta Give The Other Fellow Hell
When You Were Young And Your Heart Was An Open Book
You Used To Say Live And Let Live
(You Know You Did, You Know You Did You Know You Did)
But In This Ever Changing World In Which We Live In
Makes You Give In And Cry
