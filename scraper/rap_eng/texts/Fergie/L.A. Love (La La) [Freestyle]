[Intro]

Wattup Fergie? It's T-e-double-n
L.A. love, uh

[Verse: Tenn Buick]

Rollin' outta JFK straight to LAX
Yo I’m reppin' New York, gettin' L.A. checks
I be pumpin' out in Venice man, L.A. flex
Make love to this city yo, L.A. sex
I dig California girls like the Beach Boys
And they like the way I swagger in these streets boy
I go from Santa Monica to Beverly Hills
And I gotta turn The Chronic up whenever we chill
I’m on Rodeo Drive, turning  left on Sunset
And ride it to the coast, you know we ain't done yet
So many pretty women I already lost count and
I gotta cut the traffic so I’m rollin' through Fountain
If I get the notion, we could do it in the ocean
Got a Bruin and a Trojan, let me get this shit in motion
Let me tell you how I’m feeling, I describe it as euphoria
So every time I leave I’m back to Cali like Notorious

[Hook: Fergie]

L.A. got the people saying (la la la la la)

Vegas saying (la la la la la)
Rio saying (la la la la la)

Every city, every state, every country you know
All around the globe
Every city, every state, every country you know
This is how it goes
