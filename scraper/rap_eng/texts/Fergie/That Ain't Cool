* Both artists RAP on this song

[Fergie {Koda Kumi in background}]
Somebody saw you in the parking lot
With a girl heading to the spot {Fergie Ferg}
So now you're tryin' to play me like a fool {Kumi}
That ain't cool
That ain't cool, so {Let's go}

Chorus: Fergie & Koda Kumi
Somebody saw you in the parking lot
With a girl heading to this spot
So now you're tryin' to play me like a fool
That ain't cool
That ain't cool, so

[Verse 1: Fergie]
Did you really think I wouldn't find you out
I guess somebody decided to sell you out
They told me about her
And what you plan to do
You tried to have your cake
And eat it, too
Well, my dear, it isn't gonna work that way
It really doesn't sit well with me to be played
Karma's comin' round
With something to tell
When you hurt me, you really hurt yourself

Repeat Chorus Twice

Hook: Fergie & Koda Kumi
What you gonna do
What you gonna do about it
What you gonna do
What you gonna do about it

Repeat Hook

[Verse 2: Koda Kumi]
Did you really think that I was really that easy
Don't make me laugh
Anata ni wo tired
I'm gonna throw you out
That's what I'm gonna do
A girl can have her cake
And eat it too
I was just pretending, to play that game
Anata tachi to
Not the same
Don't come back to me like a child
I'm not your mommy
So say, "Sayonara!"

Repeat Chorus Twice

Repeat Hook Twice

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Fergie & Koda Kumi]
That ain't cool
That ain't cool, so
That ain't cool
That ain't cool, so
That ain't cool
That ain't cool, so
That ain't cool
That ain't cool, so
