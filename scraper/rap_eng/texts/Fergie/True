Yea.. Yea..
I know I know
It's true It's true
Hey hey hey hey hey it's true
My my my my my love is true
Hey hey hey hey hey it's true
My my my my my love is true
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh I know this much is true
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh I know this much is TRUE
Hey hey hey hey hey it's true
My my my my my love is true
Hey hey hey hey hey it's true
So true funny how it seems
Always in time, but never line for dreams
Head over heels when toe to toe
This is the sound of my soul, this is the sound
I know you love the way my love is (soundin')
From over there you could feel my heart(poundin')
Let me swim in your outermind (drownin)
Forever I'll be upside down (frownin')
I love you uptown, love ya (downtownin')
You could be my women,and I could be ya main man
And thats why I sat down and wrote this poem
Cuz I want the truth to be told
Boy you know I know that is true
With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
Dissolve the nerves that just begun
Listening to Marvin (all night long)
This is the sound of my soul, this is the sound
Ya I like the way your soul sounds to me
Ain't nobody do me the way you do me
I got the stamina for L-O-V-E
Whip out the camera lets make a movie
In the future we could look back at what we done did
We'll be makin love til we like a hundred
And thats why I had to remix this song
Cuz I want the truth to be told
Boy you know I know that is true
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh I know this much is true
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh I know this much is TRUE
Hey hey hey hey hey it's true
My my my my my love is true
You know it's true
You know it's true
You know I love ya girl, you know it's true
You know it's true *repeat
I know this much is true *repeat
You know it's true
You know it's true *repeat
This much is true
This much is True
You know I love ya girl
I'm there for ya baby
