[Verse 1 - B-Real]
Just an urchin living under the street
I'm a hard case, real tough to beat
I'm your charity case
So buy me something to eat
I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line

[Verse 2- Sen Dog]
Rags to riches or so they say
You got to keep pushing for the fortune and fame you know it
It's all a gamble when it's just a game
You treat it like a capital crime
Everybody's doing their time

[Chorus 1] [x2]
Take me down
To the Paradise City
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home

[Verse 3 - B-Real]
Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here I can't quite remember
The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe
I'd smoke another cigarette but I can't see
Tell me who you're going to believe

[Chorus 1] [x2]

So far away (4x)

[Verse 4 - Fergie]
Captain America's been torn apart now
He's a court jester with a broken heart
He said
"Turn me around and take me back to the start"
I must be losing my mind -
"Are you blind?!"
I've seen it all a million times

[Chorus 1] [x2]

[Chorus 2]
I want to go
I want to know
Oh, won't you please take me home

[Chorus 3]
I want to see
Oh, look at me
Oh, won't you please take me home

[Chorus 1] [x2]

Take me down
Beat me down
Oh, won't you please take me home

[Chorus 3]

I want to see
Boy, I'm going to be mean
Oh, oh take me home

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
