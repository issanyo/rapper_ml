[Intro: Fergie]
No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart
Yeah
No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart

[Hook: Fergie]
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby? (love, love)
In love baby (love, love)
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby? (love, love)
In love baby (love, love)

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Girl, you know you got me, got me
With you're pistol shot me, shot me
And I'm here helplessly
In love and nothing can stop me
It can't stop me once I started
Can't return me once you bought it
I'm coming baby, don't doubt it
(Don't make me wait) So let's be about it

[Refrain: Fergie]
No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
Baby, have some trustin', trustin'
When I come with lustin', lustin'
'Cause I'll bring you that comfort
I ain’t only here 'cause I want your
Body, I want your mind too
Interestin' what I find you
And I'm interested in the long haul
Come on girl, yee-haw!
Come on

[Hook: Fergie]
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby? (love, love)
In love baby (love, love)
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby? (love, love)
In love baby (love, love)

[Refrain: Fergie]
No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
Girl, you had me once you kissed me
My love for you is not iffy
I always want you wit me
I'll play Bobby and you play Whitney (all long)
If you smoke I smoke too
That's how much I'm in love wit chu
Crazy is what crazy do
Crazy in love, I'm a crazy fool

[Refrain: Fergie]
No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart

[Verse 4: will.i.am]
Why you so in-sa-cure
When you got passionate love hurr?
You always claimin' I'm a cheatah
Think I'll up and go leave ya
For another señorita
You forgot that I need ya
You must have caught amnesia
That's why you don't believe wha
Wha'- yeah - check it out
