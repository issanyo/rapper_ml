[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
Who's calling?
That's my baby girl on the phone (Girl on the phone)
She says she needs some space and she wanna leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
But I'm not tripping 'cause she say that ain't in the wrong
That's just the way life goes
Let me know, big girls don't cry
But please let me explain (Let me explain)
Let's sit down, work things out
Before you go on your way (Go on your way)
See, I got a lot of things on my mind
And I know you're feeling the same
'Cause the situation's out of control, yeah

[Chorus: Fergie & Sean Kingston]
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
I'm feeling blue, let's work things out
'Cause I don't know what to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
That's just the way it has to go
Big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: Fergie & (Sean Kingston)]
The smell of your skin lingers (lingers) on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your hometown (Hometown)
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby (Baby, come on)
Be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

[Chorus: Fergie & Sean Kingston]
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
I'm feeling blue, let's work things out
'Cause I don't know what to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
That's just the way it has to go
And big girls don't cry

[Bridge: Sean Kingston]
What should I do? I'm missing you and I feel so down
Now that you're gone, I can't go on, this must be the end

[Chorus: Fergie & Sean Kingston]
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
I'm feeling blue, let's work things out
'Cause I don't know what to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
That's just the way it has to go
And big girls don't cry
