[Intro]
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
Ever since I was a baby girl, I had a dream
Cinderella theme, crazy as it seems
Always knew that deep inside that there would come that day
But I would have to wait, make so many mistakes
I couldn't comprehend as I watched it unfold
This classic story told, I left it in the cold
Walking through unopened doors that led me back to you
Each one unlocking more of the truth

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I finally stopped tripping on my youth
I finally got lost inside of you
I finally know, I needed to grow
And finally my mate has met my soul

[Chorus]
Finally, now my destiny can begin
Though we will have our differences
Something strange and new is happening
Finally, now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him, finally
Mmm

[Verse 2]
I remember the beginning, you already knew
I acted like a fool, just trying to be cool
Fronting like it didn't matter, I just ran away
But on another phase, was lost in my own space
Found what it's like to hurt selfishly
Scared to give up me, afraid to just believe
I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place
Stumbled through the mess that I had made

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I finally got out of my own way
I finally started living for today
I finally know, I needed to grow
And finally my mate has met my soul

[Chorus]
Finally, now my destiny can begin
Though we will have our differences
Something strange and new is happening
Finally, now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him, finally

[Interlude]
Mmm
Finally, finally

[Chorus]
Finally, now my destiny can begin
Though we will have our differences
Something beautiful is happening, is happening
Finally, now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him, finally

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Finally, finally
Finally
