[Intro: will.i.am & Fergie]
Oh oh

[Verse 1: Fergie]
Sometimes I pick the flower cause I wanna know
He loves me not, he loves me lot, he's got to go
Not talkin 'bout the dude that's on the go, go, go
The situation that we got is so much mo'
Mo mo mo mo

[Hook 1: will.i.am]
Oh, you make me laugh, you make me cry
But I want you right, by my side
And if you go... I could die
You bring me low, you bring me high

[Hook 2: Fergie & will.i.am]
I build you up, you break me down
And that's story of our situa a a (tion tion)
You pick me up, I let you down
And that's story of our situa a a (tion tion)

[Verse 2: Fergie]
My therapist told me that opposites attract
I wish that you was here when opposites attack
You love me then you hate me, what's it gonna be?
Don't wanna miss the magic that is you and me

[Hook 3: will.i.am]
Oh, oh, oh
You make me glow, you make me shine
We always fight, right on time
And if you go... I could die
You bring me low, you bring be high

[Hook 2: Fergie + will.i.am]
I build you up, you break me down
And that's story of our situa a a (tion tion)
You pick me up, I let you down
And that's story of our situa a a (tion tion)

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
Sometimes we don't see each other eye to eye baby
We up and down like a rollercoster ride baby
Sometimes you don't see the way-way I, I try baby
I, hate the way you make me wanna cry lady
I wanna fly away, sometimes I need a break
The way you treat me make, me wanna go in-s-a-aane
But I can go on, without you in my arm
I can't resist the way, you used me wit'cha charm

[Hook 3: will.i.am]
Oh, oh, oh
You make me glow, you make me shine
We always fight, right on time
And if you go... I could die
You bring me low, you bring be high

[Hook 2: Fergie & will.i.am]
I build you up, you break me down
And that's story of our situa a a (tion tion)
You pick me up, I let you down
And that's story of our situa a a (tion tion)
I build you up, you break me down
And that's story of our situa a a (tion tion)
You pick me up, I let you down
And that's story of our situa a a (tion tion)

[Outro: Fergie]
Whoah
