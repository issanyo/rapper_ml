[Verse 1]
You don't know what it feels to be me
Wish you could feel it
You would never survive this burning
Fever growing inside this shell that you call a body
What have you done to us?

[Verse 2]
You know when I'm most insecure
You break me down further, I could never live up to perfect
Oh, oh, oh
Just when I've had enough, your butane love fills me up
It's fire we're playing with
And I'm like a moth attracted to the flame

[Pre-Chorus]
And one day when you wake up missing me
I hope you go insane, oh
'Cause pain is love and love is pain
'Cause pain is love and love is pain
'Cause pain is love and love is pain

[Chorus]
And when it hurts like crazy, you will appreciate me
'Cause no one else will love you more
And take the pain from your thoughts
And when your world is falling
Maybe I'll let you crawl in
When you can love me all the way
'Cause pain is love and love is pain

[Verse 3]
Stoic face on the outside, got this soul on the inside
I have cried you a thousand oceans
Pulled in every direction, this Vitruvian woman
I can't stretch enough to be everything to every one
That's real

[Pre-Chorus]
And one day when you wake up missing me
I hope you go insane, oh
'Cause pain is love and love is pain
'Cause pain is love and love is pain

[Chorus]
And when it hurts like crazy, you will appreciate me
'Cause no one else will love you more
And take the pain from your thoughts
And when your world is falling
Maybe I'll let you crawl in
When you can love me all the way, oh
