[Verse 1]
Can you feel the life?
It's a full moon tonight
So bring your appetite
To feast on the mood
Drink up the groove
Feel the bass in your bones
As the horns make you moan
Let the drums take the throan
And get in the mood
Slide in the groove

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I really wanna see ya dancin'
I really wanna see ya movin'
There's a party on the boat we cruise in
Woah...

[Chorus]
If you're feelin' like I'm feelin'
Then move your body
Don't stop, don't stop
Move your body
Give it all you got now everybody
Bailamos!
Bailamos!
If you're feelin' like I'm feelin'
Then move your body
Don't stop, don't stop
Move your body
Give it all you got now everybody
Bailamos!
Bailamos!

[Verse 2]
Now they're looking your way
As your starting to sway
To the band as they play
So feast on the mood
Drink up the groove
Move your hips, shake your thang!
Tell the guitar to sing
Hear the fever bells ring
Now piano moves

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I really wanna see ya dancin'
I really wanna see ya movin'
There's a party on the boat we cruise in
Woah woah

[Chorus]
If you're feelin' like I'm feelin'
Then move your body
Don't stop, don't stop
Move your body
Give it all you got now everybody

Then move your body
Don't stop, don't stop
Move your body

If you're feelin' like I'm feelin'
