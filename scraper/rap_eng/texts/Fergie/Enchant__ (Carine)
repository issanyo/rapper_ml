[Intro]
Enchanté, comment allez-vous?
Très bien, merci et vous?
Et vous? Et vous?
Et vous? Et vous? Et vous?

[Verse 1]
Enchanted, delighted to meet you, excited
The people, the music, I want you, consume it
Too simple, this greeting, a ritual, a meeting
The first time impressions, your truest expression

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could reach and hold your hand, I would
If I could live inside this dance, I would
If I could reach and hold your hand, I would
If I could live inside this dance, I would

[Chorus]
Enchanté, comment allez-vous?
Très bien, merci et vous?
Et vous? Et vous?
Et vous? Et vous? Et vous?
Enchanté, comment allez-vous?
Très bien, merci et vous?
Et vous? Et vous?
Et vous? Et vous? Et vous?

[Verse 2]
This feeling, can't lose it, it's better to use it
To find out, discover how we like each other
The mystery, not knowing
Why can't we be showing our secrets, the magic?
Let's reach out and grab it

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could reach and hold your hand, I would
If I could live inside this dance, I would
If I could reach and hold your hand, I would
If I could live inside this dance, I would

[Chorus]
Enchanté, comment allez-vous?
Très bien, merci et vous?
Et vous? Et vous?
Et vous? Et vous? Et vous?
Enchanté, comment allez-vous?
Très bien, merci et vous?
Et vous? Et vous?
Et vous? Et vous? Et vous?

[Bridge]
You come and go my way, let's do this every day
Happy is where I be, so take a ride with me
So come and go my way, let's do this every day
Happy is where I be, so take a ride with me

[Verse 3]
New memories, new faces, subplotted, embrace it
With kisses, "I love you's," below and above you
The details, the levels make me want to revel
Inside your perspective, I swear I'm objective

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could reach and hold your hand, I would
If I could live inside this dance, I would
If I could reach and hold your hand, I would
If I could live inside this dance, I would

[Outro]
Hi, hello, and how are you?
Very well, thank you, and you?
And you? And you?
And you? And you? And you?
