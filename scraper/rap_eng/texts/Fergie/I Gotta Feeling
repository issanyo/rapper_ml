[Hook]
I got a feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
I got a feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

[Post-Hook]
Tonight's the night
Let's live it up
I got my money
Let's spend it up
Go out and smash it
Like, "Oh my God!"
Jump out that sofa
Let's kick it
Off!

[Verse 1]
I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down, and go out, and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out, spaced out, and losing all control

[Refrain]
Fill up my cup
Mazel tov
Look at her dancing, just take it off!
Let's paint the town
We'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof

[Refrain 2]
And then we'll do it again
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it, and do it (let's live it up)
And do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it

[Hook]
'Cause I got a feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

[Post-Hook]

[Verse 2]
Here we come, here we go, we gotta rock (Rock rock rock rock rock)
Easy come, easy go, now we on top (Top top top top top)
Fill the shot, body rock, rock it don't stop (Stop stop stop stop stop)
Round and round, up and down, around the clock (Rock rock rock rock rock)

[Verse 3]

Weeekend get get get with us, you know what we say
Party every day, p-p-p-party every day

[Hook]

That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
