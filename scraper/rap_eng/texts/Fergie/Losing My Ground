[Intro]
The time is 8:03 PM
Don't know what day it is
What's going on?
Mmm
Is this real?
No-no
No-no-no-no
Ahh-ahh-ahh

[Verse 1]
I woke up short of breath
But still, I've got a long day ahead of me
I don't know what day it is
But tell me, 'cause I gotta know who to be
Is that me up in the mirror?
'Cause I thought it was somebody else
Well, it's a realization when you find out
You don't even wanna look at yourself

[Chorus]
Where do I go?
What do I do?
Who do I turn to?
I'm losing my ground
Who am I now?
Where does it end?
How did it all begin?
I'm losing my ground

[Break]
Grou-ou-ou-ound
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm on my feet
It's time to hit the streets
And get my life back together again
Well, this place is all a masquerade
So tell me, where in line can I cut in?
Downtown wandering aimlessly around
Still don't know what I'm trying to find
Well, you could flash all the pretty lights in front of me
I still wouldn't see the sign

[Chorus]
Where do I go?
What do I do?
Who do I turn to?
I'm losing my ground
Who am I now?
Where does it end?
How did it all begin?
I'm losing my ground

[Break]
Grou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ound
I'm losing my--
I'm losing my--
I'm losing my ground!
Ooh!

[Bridge]
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ba da da da da da
(Losing my ground)
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
(Losing my ground)
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
(Losing my ground)

[Break]
Hoo-whoa-oa-oa!
Hoo-whoa-oa-oa!
Hoo-whoa-oa!
Hoo-whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa!

[Hook]
Where do I go?
(Why do I do this time myself?)
I'm losing my--
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?

[Break]
Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeha-eah-eah-eah

[Chorus]
(Don't wanna go back there)
Where do I go?
(Don't wanna go back there)
What do I do?
(I hear it coming, hear it coming)
(Hear it coming, hear it coming)
Who do I turn to?
(And I don't wanna go back)
I'm losing my ground
(Don't wanna go back there)
Who am I now?
(Don't wanna go back there)
Where does it end?
(I hear it coming, hear it coming)
(Hear it coming, hear it coming)
How did it all begin?
(And I don't wanna go back)
I'm losing my ground

[Outro]
Grou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ound
I'm losing my--
I'm losing my--
I'm losing my ground!
Ooh!
The time is 8:03 PM
