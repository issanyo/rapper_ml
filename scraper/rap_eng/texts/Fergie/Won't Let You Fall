[Verse 1]
I'll never let you go
So, never let me go
I will be your journey
And you will be my road
Down the stormy path
Love will never come to pass
It will be an anchor
Although the winds may blow

[Pre-Chorus]
And through the depths of high and low
Wherever you will go, I'll follow
To the end, back again
You know

[Chorus]
Won't let you fall
Fall out of love
‘Cause together we'll be holding on
‘Cause all we have is us
Won't let you go
Go away again
Because life don't mean nothing at all
If I don't have your love

[Verse 2]
I will dry your tears
Take away your fears
Let me be your shelter
Your heart is safe in here
So beautiful and pure
There's nothing I would not endure
Oh, love as got me blinded
I see it all so clear

[Pre-Chorus]
And through the depths of high and low
Wherever you will go, I'll follow
To the end, back again
You know

[Chorus]
Won't let you fall
Fall out of love
‘Cause together we'll be holding on
‘Cause all we have is us
Won't let you go
Go away again
Because life don't mean nothing at all
If I don't have your love

[Bridge]
I'm down for you for whatever
Anything you going through
What's mine is yours
Every little thing
I got you
Even when winds will change
Come smashing down and crashing on you

[Chorus]
Won't let you fall
Fall out of love
‘Cause together we'll be holding on
‘Cause all we have is us
Won't let you go
Go away again
Because life don't mean nothing at all
If I don't have your love
