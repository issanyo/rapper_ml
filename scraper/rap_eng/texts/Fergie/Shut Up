[Intro: Fergie]
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (oh no)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

[Hook: Fergie]
We try to take it slow
But we're still losin control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm crazy
For tryna be your laaadddy
I think I'm goin' crazy

[Verse 2: will.i.am & Fergie, Both]
Girl, me and you were just fine (you know)
We wine and dine
Did them things that couples do when in love (you know)
Walks on the beach and stuff (you know)
Things that lovers say and do
I love you boo, I love you too
I miss you a lot, I miss you even more
That's why I flew you out when we was on tour
But then something got out of hand
You start yellin' when I'm with my friends
Even though I had legitimate reasons (bullshit)
You know I have to make them dividends (bullshit)
How could you trust your private eyes, girl?
That's why you don't believe my lies
And quick to say

[Hook: Fergie]
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
We try to take it slow
But we're still losin' control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm crazy
For tryna be your lady
I think I'm goin' crazy

[Verse 2: Taboo]
Why does emotion gotta move so fast?
Love is progress if you could make it last
Why is it that you just lose control?
Everytime you agree on takin' it slow
So why does it got to be so damn tough?
'Cause fools in lust could never get enough of love
Showin' him the love that you be givin'
Changing up your livin' for a lovin' transition
Girl, it's a mission tryin' to get you to listen
We mad at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street sayin'
"Who the hell?!"
Who the hell?
What the hell's goin' down?
Too much of the bickering
Kill it with the sound and...

[Hook: Fergie & (will.i.am)]
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up
We try to take it slow
But we're still losin' control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm crazy (for what?)
(Crazy for what?) For tryin' to be your lady (oh yeah)
I think I'm goin' crazy

[Hook: Fergie & (will.i.am), Both]
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (what?)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (whatcha say?)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (what?)
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up (whatcha say?)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (girl, whatcha say?)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (no, girl)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

[Bridge: will.i.am & Fergie]
Girl, our love is dying
Why did you stop tryin'
I never been a quitah
But I do deserve betta
Believe me I will do bad
Let's forget the past
And let's start this new plan
Why? 'Cause it's the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream
Girl, I know you're tired of the things they say
You're damn right
'Cause I heard them lame dame excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
No it ain't
That was a different thing
It was the same damn thing
Same ass excuses
Boy you're useless
Woah, oh!!

[Breakdown]
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
(Don't go now, no please, I don't know)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (oh no)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

[Outro: will.i.am & Fergie]
Stop the talking, baby
Or I start walking, baby
Stop the talking, baby (yeah, yeah)
Or I start walking, baby
Stop the talking, baby
Or I start walking, baby
Stop the talking, baby (no, oh, oh, oh)
Or I start walking, baby
Is that all there is?
Stop the talking, baby
Or I start walking, baby
Is that all there is?
Stop the talking, baby
Or I start walking, baby
Is that all there is?
Stop the talking, baby
Or I start walking, baby
Is that all there is?
Stop the talking, baby
Or I start walking, baby
Is that all there is?
Stop the talking, baby
Or I start walking, baby
Is that all there is?
Stop the talking, baby
Or I start walking, baby
Is that all there is?
Is that all there is?
Is that all there is?
Is that all there is?
Is that all there is?
