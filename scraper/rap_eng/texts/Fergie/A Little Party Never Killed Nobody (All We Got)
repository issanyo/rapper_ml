[Intro: Q-Tip]
Just one night all we got
Just one night all we got
Just one night all we got
Just one night all we got

[Verse 1: Fergie]
I ain’t got time for you baby, either you’re mine or you’re not
Make up your mind sweet baby, right here, right now’s all we got

[Chorus: Fergie]
A little party never killed nobody, so we gon’ dance until we drop, uhm
A little party never killed nobody, right here, right now’s all we got

[Verse 2: Fergie]
Islands, diamonds, trips around the world
Don’t mean a thing if I ain’t your girl

[Chorus: Fergie]
A little party never killed nobody, so we gon’ dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody, right here, right now’s all we got
Oooh, a little party never killed nobody, so we gon’ dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody, right here, right now’s all we got

[Post-Chorus: Q-Tip]
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got , got, got
Got Damn

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Glad that you made it, look around
You don’t see one person sitting down
They got drinks in their hands and the room’s a bust
At the end of the night maybe you’ll find love
Fake chit chat ’bout the things they got
And my stout reputation keeping it hot
At the party of the year and my master plan
Is to make you realize I’m your man

[Verse 4: Fergie]
If the people get live underneath the moonlight
Hotsy-totsy, paparazzi, hold it while I take this flick
Speakeasy, rockin' the feathers, I’m breezy
Hope you can keep up boys, cause believe me, I’m the bee's knees

[Bridge: Fergie]
It don’t mean a thing if I give you my heart
If you tear it apart, no, uh, uh, ah, oh
It don’t mean a thing if I ain’t in your eyes
Probably ain’t gonna fly, no, uh, uh, ah, oh
It don’t mean a thing if I give you my heart
If you tear it apart, no, uh, uh, ah, oh
It don’t mean a thing if I ain’t in your eyes
Probably ain’t gonna fly, no, uh, uh, ah, oh

[Post-Bridge: Q-Tip]
Just one night all we got
Just one night all we got
Just one night all we got
Just one night all we got

[Interlude: Fergie]
What do you think GoonRock?
Are you ready?

[Chorus: Fergie]
A little party never killed nobody, so we gon’ dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody, right here, right now’s all we got
A little party never killed nobody, so we gon’ dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody, ah, ah
