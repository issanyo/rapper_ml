[Mick Jagger]
Ooo
OooOoo, a storm is threatenin', my very life today
If I don't get some shelter, oh I'm gonna' fade away

[Chorus: Mick Jagger & Bono]
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away

[Bono]
Ooo, see the fire sweeping up every street today
Burns like a red coal carpet, mad bull lost it's way

[Chorus: Mick Jagger & Bono]

[Fergie]
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away

[Mick Jagger]
Ooo, a storm is threatenin' my very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter, oh lord I'm gonna' fade away

[Mick Jagger, Bono, Fergie]
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
I said a love sister, it's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away, kiss away, kiss away
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Love sister, it's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
Love sister, it's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Love sister, it's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
War children, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
