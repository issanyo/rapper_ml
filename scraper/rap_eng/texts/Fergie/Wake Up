[Intro]
What?
Uh-uh
Ah-huh
Give it to me now

[Verse 1]
Well, why do I keep pulling out the roots in my hair?
I'm picking at my face, its obvious there's nothing there
What do I keep at the edge of my skin?
It feels so good to have a taste of what I'm crawling in
I got to go, I got to leave
The waves are changed today, I'm pulling me
Even though I go with hip-hop, today
It's taking to your next game

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
'Cause I'll be leaving you today now
Shake up, shake up, don't breakup, breakup
Take your lips off mine
Who could see these words are swinging?
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

[Verse 2]
What did you keep coming out two sides of your mouth?
You didn't think I had hit my people on how your selling out
What did you think making your decision, I'm dumb
Manipulative, calculative, and a pet, you thought
I didn't know I couldn't see
The spade and plain plan for using me
Like the picture you counterfeit its time to say good-night
Its not a reason to say good-bye, good-bye, buh-bye

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
'Cause I'll be leaving you today now
Shake up, shake up, don't breakup, breakup
Take your lips off mine
Who could see these words are swinging?
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

[Bridge]
The coffee is brewing now
As for me pouring out
Eyes open, now I see
All that you take from me

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
'Cause I'll be leaving you today now
Shake up, shake up, don't breakup, breakup
Take your lips off mine
Who could see these words are swinging?
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
