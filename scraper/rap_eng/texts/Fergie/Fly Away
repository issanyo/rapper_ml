[Verse  1: Fergie]
You're here, so gone
This dark has got suddenly turned into dawn
I know you've already been here too long, too long, too long
Although you won't see me fall from grace
You step on my solace you walk away
My demise you'll never know
I'm letting you go...

[Chorus: Fergie]
(Fly away now)
Flip it up, flip it up
Get back on the truck
Got to keep moving keep reppin' it up
Mix it up mix it up time for the next stop
You got to go now and fill yourself
(Fly away now, fly away now)
Switch it up Switch it up go hop on that bus
Don't need to blow the horn I'll be tough, hey

[Verse 2: Fergie]
You take me from me
With you forever, but darling I see
The world is who you belong to, not me
So I set you free

[Chorus: Fergie]
(Fly away now)
