[Intro: Fergie]
Relax, don’t do it
When you want to go to it
Relax, don’t do it
When you wanna come
Relax, don’t do it
When we got the glove moving
Relax, don’t do it
When you wanna, when you wanna come
When you wanna come (come)
Come

[Verse 1: Fergie]
Pumped up with the sex appeal
‘Bout to cop another feel
Then I foot the bill
I got bang bang bang with the looks to kill
Sashay, Shantay and hit the Blue Steel
You tryna ride in the cool mobile
Wanna keep me on the line cuz my culo real
Rock-rockstar chick with the Goose on chill
And my pockets all fat, gotta sell my deal
Bitch on the sounds of the camera flick
Got look on the globe in all on a lick
I do and when I think of myself, “Its too thick”, “It’s to given all up’’
But I just say “I ain't no quitter”

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m all my Mugatu
I’ll go while I got you
Smash it, in plenty of fashion
Doing my anthem, now give ’em my Magnum

[Chorus]
Relax, don’t do it
When you want to go to it
Relax, don’t do it
When you wanna come
Relax don’t do it
When you got the glam moving
Relax don’t do it
When you wanna, when you wanna come
When you wanna come (come)
Come

[Verse 2: ASAP Rocky)
Pack it up [?]
You're just irrelevant as old as the president
your style is like the replican
and that's a definite
give grief to all your relatives
and next to kin and gave them the attention
[?]
When I say ancient relics
Hansel and derek, I'm handome, be jealous
[?]
[?] take when you smell it
Im sorry Donatari, donatella suggested valentina
[?]

[Bridge: Fergie]
Shooting in the right direction
Make it your intention
Live those dreams
Skin on skins
Now hit me, hit me, hit me with those laser beams

[Chorus: Fergie]
Relax, don’t do it
When you want to go to it
Relax, don’t do it
When you wanna come
Relax, don’t do it
When we got the glove moving
Relax, don’t do it
When you wanna, when you wanna come
When you wanna come (come)
Come

[Chorus 2: Akon & Fergie]
Relax, don’t do it
When you want to go to it
Relax, don’t do it Face
Relax, don’t do it Body
When you want to go to it
Relax, don’t do it
When you wanna come
when you wanna come
when you wanna come
when you wanna come
(Face
Face
Body
Body
Face, Body x5)
Give me body

[Outro: Fergie]
When it’s time, you know it’s time
When it’s time, you know it’s time
When it’s time, you know it’s time
When it’s time, you know it’s time
I’ll let you know when it’s time
