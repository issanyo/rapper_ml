[Hook]
I just wanna be close to you

[Verse 1]
The way you look in the morning
I can see your face and your daze
The way (The way, the way)
Your silence always has so much to say, to say
With you, my king is where I belong
Our castle is beautiful and strong

[Hook]
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you

[Verse 2]
How you own this body
Smoke your cigarette
Sing to me in bed
The way (The way, the way)
You hold me like you're protecting your throne
I'll be your queen
We can fit so well
If near me darling is where you dwell

[Hook]
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you, to you

[Verse 3]
You say I'm talking and laughing, mI'm not
Breakfast in bed, have a play pillow fight
We'll hang like homies 'cause your my best friend
I know I'm safe just as long as I feel your skin
Not that I need, I'm secure with myself
Space, trust and respect, I understand well

[Bridge]
Baby, I just see such beauty in you
That I need is being close too
If near me darling is where you dwell

[Hook]
I just wanna be close to you, you, you, oh
I just wanna be close to you, oh, oh
(la, dada...)
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
