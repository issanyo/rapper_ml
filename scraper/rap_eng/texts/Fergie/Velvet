[Verse 1]
It's cold outside, why don't you come in?
I know, my walls are crumbling
It's late at night, and lately I've been alone
But that could be changing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What you do to me, conjures up feelings
I've never felt before, and your company I adore
So deliciously, gold and burgundy
Sink into me, I feel so warm

[Chorus]
I feel you, I taste you
The smoothest wine
Like velvet, can't help it
This love's divine

[Post-Chorus]
I'm ready to feel you
Mmm, I'm ready
You don't even know how ready I am
I'm feelin' you, it's nice

[Verse 2]
The moon is full, the stars are aligned
I know, just look into my eyes
It's beautiful, your skin against mine
I hope, you let your mind take flight

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Under velvet skies
Lover, we can fly away from the world
Let all of our love unfurl
What a gorgeous ride
You don't have to hide a thing from me, I am your girl

[Chorus]
I feel you, I taste you
The smoothest wine (The smoothest wine)
Like velvet, can't help it
This love's divine
(I'm ready to feel you)

[Bridge]
I'm ready to feel you
Slowly we escape
Our time we can take, we can take, we can take
I'm ready to feel you
Feel you, feel you, feel you, feel you, feel

[Chorus]
I feel you, I taste you (Ready to feel you, baby)
(Feel you) The smoothest wine
Like velvet, can't help it (Oh, yeah, so smooth, so smooth)
This love's divine
(I'm ready to feel you)
I feel you, I taste you
The smoothest wine (It's so smooth, I'm ready to feel you)
Like velvet, can't help it
This love's divine
(I'm ready to feel you)
