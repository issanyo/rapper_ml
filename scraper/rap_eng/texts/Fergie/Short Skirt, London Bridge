[Intro]
(Oh, shit) x4

It's me
Fergie
The pen
Polo!
Fergie Ferg, what's up baby?!
Come on

[Verse 1: Fergie]
When I come to the clubs, step aside (Oh, shit)
Part the seas, don't be having me in the line (Oh, shit)
V.I.P 'cause you know I gotta shine (Oh, shit)
I'm Fergie Ferg and me love you long time (Oh shit)
All my girls get down on the floor (Oh, shit)
Back to back drop it down real low (Oh, shit)
I'm such a lady but I'm dancing like a ho (Oh, shit)
'cause you know I don't give a fuck so here we go! (Oh shit)

[Chorus (x2):]
How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna go down
Like London London London wanna go down
Like London London London be going down like

The drinks start pouring
And my speech start slurring
Everybody start looking real good (Oh, shit)

[Verse 2: Fergie]
The Grey Goose got your girl feeling loose
Now I'm wishing that I didn't wear these shoes (I hate heels)
It's like every time I get up on the dude
Paparazzi put my business in the news
And I'm like get up out my face (oh, shit)
'fore I turn around and spray your ass with mace (oh, shit)
My lips make you wanna have a taste (oh, shit)
You got that? I got the bass (Uh)

[Chorus (x2):]
How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna go down
Like London London London wanna go down
Like London London London be going down like

[Verse 3: Cake]
I want a girl with a mind like a diamond
I want a girl who knows what's best
I want a girl with shoes that cut
And eyes that burn like cigarettes
I want a girl with the right allocations
Who's fast and thorough
And sharp as a tack
She's playing with her jewelry
She's putting up her hair
She's touring the facility
And picking up slack
I want a girl with a short skirt and a lonnnng jacket......(Oh, shit)

[Verse 4: Fergie]
When I come to the clubs, step aside (Oh, shit)
Part the seas, don't be having me in the line (Oh, shit)
V.I.P 'cause you know I gotta shine (Oh, shit)
I'm Fergie Ferg and me love you long time (Oh shit)
All my girls get down on the floor (Oh, shit)
Back to back drop it down real low (Oh, shit)
I'm such a lady but I'm dancing like a ho (Oh, shit)
'cause you know I don't give a fuck so here we go! (Oh shit)

[Chorus (x2):]
How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna go down
Like London London London wanna go down
Like London London London be going down like

I want a girl with a short skirt and a lonnnnng.... lonnng jacket
Ah, da, da, da, da, doo, doo, doo, doo

Me like a bullet type, you know they comin' right
Fergie love em' long time,  My girls support right?
