[Verse 1: will.i.am]
I got these haters on my back, these haters on my back
Gotta get these motherfuckin' haters off my back
I know why they hatin cause I'm sittin on stacks
Now I'm steady chillin and I'm spendin all that
I'm a big beat pumper, they rockin my sound
Out in outer space, I come from underground
Now I'm on top, holdin town, ground
All them haters hatin on the bottom, drown

[Bridge 1: Fergie & The Black Eyed Peas]

Mash the dancehall make everybody holler
Ahhhh - block, block, blocka
Ahhhh - ain't nobody hotter

Eight arms, octagon
Straight charm, watch the Don
Man I got the bottles poppin
Party people got 'em rockin
Yeah I got the antidote
Here's a dose
Damn I'm dope
Check me out, here we go
Here we go, back for mo'
Hungry like an animal
High class, on the ground
Check the up and low my style
Blazed up, branded shoes
Jumping off like Delta Blues
Here I come, super cool
