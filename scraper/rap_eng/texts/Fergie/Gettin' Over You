[Pre-Chorus 1: Fergie]
All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over, no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Chris Willis]
Wish I could spin my world into reverse
Just to have you back again
There's no gettin' over, there's no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you, no, no

[Verse: LMFAO]
Hey hey, I can't forget you, baby
I think about you everyday
I tried to masquerade the pain
That's why I'm next to the booth
D-d-d-dance to the groove
But, but there is no, there is no
(Just no gettin' over you)
Baby, it feels so right
To dance to the beat of night
That heat between you and I
Freak, freak to the morning light
We like to live life fast
And pour them shots up in the glass
But there is no, there is no
(Just no gettin' over you)

[Chorus: LMFAO]
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and party
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and

[Pre-Chorus 1: Fergie]
All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over, no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Chris Willis]
Wish I could spin my world into reverse
Just to have you back again
There's no gettin' over, there's no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you, no, no

[Chorus: LMFAO]
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and party
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and

[Bridge: Fergie]
People in the place
If you've ever felt love
Then you know, yeah, you know
What I'm talkin' about
There's no gettin' over

[Chorus: LMFAO]
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and party
And part and party
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and party
And party and party
