[Intro: Polow Da Don]
Are you ready? Are you ready?

[Refrain: Polow da Don]
If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home, you say it!
"If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home!"

[Hook: Fergie]
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yeah
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S

[Chorus: Fergie]
We flying first class, up in the sky
Popping champagne
Living my life in the fast lane
I won't change by the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, the glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, the glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy

[Verse 1: Fergie]
Wear them gold and diamond rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperones and limousines, shopping for expensive things
I be on the movie screens, magazines and bougie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine
I still go to Taco Bell, drive-thru, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell
After the show or after the Grammy's
I like to go cool out with the family
Sipping, reminiscing on days when I had a Mustang
And now I'm...

[Chorus: Fergie]
First class, up in the sky
Popping champagne
Living my life in the fast lane
I won't change by the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, the glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, the glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I'm talking champagne wishes, caviar dreams
You deserve nothing but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue what to do with us
I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us
Plus I gotta keep enough lettuce to support your shoe fetish
Lifestyles so rich and famous, Robin Leach will get jealous
Half a million for the stones
Taking trips from here to Rome
So if you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home

[Hook: Fergie]
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yeah
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S

[Chorus: Fergie]
We flying first class, up in the sky
Popping champagne
Living my life in the fast lane
I won't change by the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, the glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, the glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy

[Bridge: Fergie]
I got problems up to here, I got people in my ear
Telling me these crazy things that I don't wanna know (Fuck ya'll)
I got money in the bank and I'd really like to thank
All the fans I'd like to thank, thank you, really though
'Cause I remember yesterday, when I dreamt about the days
When I'd rock on MTV, that'd be really dope
Damn, it's been a long road and the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy told me so, he let his daughter know

[Outro: Fergie & Polow Da Don]
(If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home, you say it!)
My daddy told me so
("If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home!")
He let his daughter know
(He said, if you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home, you say it!)
My daddy told me so
("If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home!")
He let his daughter know
