[Intro: Fergie]
Can you feel the hy-y-y-ype?

[Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie]
Can you feel it in your body-ah
(Can you feel it)
Can you feel it in your body-ah
(Can you feel it)
Coz I can feel it in my body-ah
(I can feel it)
It feels good to my body-ah
To my body, in my body-ah
(Can you feel it)
Can you feel it in your body-ah
(Can you feel it)
Coz I can feel it in my body-ah
(I can feel it)
It feels good to my body-ah

[Bridge: apl.de.ap & will.i.am]
We gonna make y'all feel it
Make y'all feel it
Make y'all wanna jam
Fellas in the place just clap your hands
Ladies in the house just grab a man
We gonna make y'all feel it
Make y'all feel it
Make y'all wanna move
Lades in the place just show 'em proof
Fellas in the house you know what to do

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
We gonna make y'all feel it in a special way
An event full of action and expos√©
Ladies in the club looking ready to play
And I'm waiting for the right one to pass my way
And in the mean time I'm about to roll up The Hague
We got drinks on the table, tied up our lay
And it's time to unwind if you've had a low day
And ladies, I got something to say

[Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie]
Can you feel it in your body-ah
(Can you feel it)
Can you feel it in your body-ah
(Can you feel it)
Coz I can feel it in my body-ah
(I can feel it)
It feels good to my body-ah
To my body, in my body-ah
(Can you feel it)
Can you feel it in your body-ah
(Can you feel it)
Coz I can feel it in my body-ah
(I can feel it)
It feels good to my body-ah

[Bridge: Taboo & will.i.am]
We gonna make y'all feel it
Make y'all feel it
Make y'all wanna jam
Fellas in the place just clap your hands
Ladies in the house just grab a man
We gonna make y'all feel it
Make y'all feel it
Make y'all wanna move
Lades in the place just show 'em proof
Fellas in the house you know what to do

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
Feel the vibration of the bass charm
Put your head on the speaker, get your face blown
Get up on the floor, get your dance on
Coz your backbone's connected to your ass, go on
The ladies all dressed in high fashion (hot!)
Dancing all sexy with passion
Honey, if you don't mind me asking
Can you feel all that bass in that ass, hun?

[Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie]
Can you feel it in your body-ah
(Can you feel it)
Can you feel it in your body-ah
(Can you feel it)
Coz I can feel it in my body-ah
(I can feel it)
It feels good to my body-ah
To my body, in my body-ah
(Can you feel it)
Can you feel it in your body-ah
(Can you feel it)
Coz I can feel it in my body-ah
(I can feel it)
It feels good to my body-ah

[Verse 3: Taboo]
This is it (this is it)
Gotta keep 'em moving (don't stop) (don't stop)
Once you get movin, don't quit (don't quit)
Next thing you know, you on top (you on top)
So hop to the rhythm that we (drop) (drop)
Get loose and express what you got (what you got)
At least you gotta give yourself a shot (a shot)
Hey never give up and gimmie what you got

[Fergie & will.i.am]
Can you feel the hy-y-y-ype?
I can feel the hy-y-y-ype
Can you feel the hy-y-y-ype?
I can feel the hy-y-y-ype

[Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie]
Can you feel it in your body-ah
(Can you feel it)
Can you feel it in your body-ah
(Can you feel it)
Coz I can feel it in my body-ah
(I can feel it)
It feels good to my body-ah
To my body, in my body-ah
(Can you feel it)
Can you feel it in your body-ah
(Can you feel it)
Coz I can feel it in my body-ah
(I can feel it)
It feels good to my body-ah
