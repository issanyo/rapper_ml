[Intro: Louis Logic]
Yo Bugz, we got 'em on the run, man

[Verse 1
They say you die alone, wake up right at home
Close your sleepy eyes and roll into the great wide unknown
That's why I don't sleep through the night
I leave my light aglow, writing notes to places that I'd like to go

Carry a lighter load than in my yesteryear
Cause I left the fear I kept inside behind like an empty beer
I'm so grateful mother nature [lent me ears? let me hear?]
Cause I'm my own label, stubborn agent, and engineer

I'm both playful and hateful, which makes me
Just about the most able stallion in the whole stable
Gallant with the talent, with [discs?] that says I won't wait til
The rap scene gets pissed away like your old cradle

I'm Old Faithful when I spout out the mouth
And bring the rainfall down on your house
The louder you shout for help
The more you cowards'll doubt yourself
Most rap fans are Batman without the belt

Not braves, standard hip hop slaves
Never take advantage of the canvas that god gave
My curse is that I'm diverse and got flavor
Passed on by birth, so I can't fix my odd ways

Why would I try to? Change me and deny you
I'm too lost in the cause of trying to find truth
Undenied proof that there's still reason to run and buy tunes
As long as there's still someone like Lou

[Chorus: Louis Logic] (x2)
I dance to the beat of my own drummer
Advanced on the beach as a lone gunner
The strong branch on the old spruce
So it should come as no wonder how I stand on my own two

[Verse 2: Bugz]
Yo, check it, understand I know my place
I never hesitate or waste
I simply demonstrate and lace the [?] style
With thoughts of grace ...[?]
And hold my own, and only [foes who fear my tone]
When I'm at home up on the stage alone
Enraged inside a poem, I'm zoning out
I'm holding on to moments, indulging you
But I love it, and what I love
Is destroying the wack opponents, [I'm yawning?]
I live it, I give it a little bit of this driven energy
[Shitted? then?] I'm in it just to win it, I
Follow my own plans, stand on my own, I'm my own man
Yeah. [Part?] of the program? Nah
A lone gunner, [go chase the ? ?]
Some of the funner numbers
That I'll have you huming in the summer
To sum it up, some of us are just plain capable
While other microphone fiends scream plain breakable
Brake and pull away from the fake lane, let it go
Let 'em know today so the game don't take a fall

[Chorus]  (x2)

[Interlude: Louis Logic]
Yeah, yo, I walk, through the valley
Of the battles and fresh, I shall fear no feeble
Louis Logic and Bugz, the lone gunners
Putting suckers to rest

[Verse 3: Bugz]
Soon to be napping, there ain't no usual scrapping
We got the ?...
?
...absentminded
?
...But now it's in my possession
?
To murder wack emcees stepping, I let 'em have it
A lone gunner with ease
Hesitate to take a shot, you'll maybe succeed

[Chorus] (x2)

[Outro: Bugz?]
Yeah, Bugz, Louis Logic
(LL: tell 'em Bugz)

LL: Louis Logic and Bugz

[Chorus] (x2)
