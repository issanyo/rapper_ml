[Intro- Chaos Kid]
Never took a second look at my shadow
I had no reason to slow down
I had to go
To the fullest extent that I could go
Here goes my brain, yo
Slow it down- here it goes, yo...

[Verse 1: Bugz]
YEAH, my name is Bugz
And bud is my favourite drug
I love to get pissy, drinking whiskey from the jug
And if I stumble into you we gon' rumble
And if you swing first, I'll block your shot like Mutombo
"But Bugz, he got a gun tho! Ain't you about to run?"
No! If I wasn't packin', what the fuck would I come for?
One of my precautions when the statics is to happen
Is wiping all my slugs, holding my clips all in a napkin
Fuck scrappin', I got a pistol in the issue
Kidnappin' your bitch with my demands written on tissue
That nigga's pussy, and that's the reason that I diss you
Your stage show is wack, and I'm glad that I missed you
You mild-mannered Mary Poppin niggas don't be bustin' nothing
That is able to be fucking with the Dirty Dozen
I spit filth cousin- fuck comin' clean
My rhymes are dirtier than ridin'....

[Bridge: D Sharp and Chaos Kid]
Hardcore!
(Acting kinda wack...)
Got ya hummin'!
(He's acting kinda brash)
Just bust a rhyme!
(He's acting kinda wack)
Aiyyo, Ju-Ju!
Take the DJ out the back!

[Verse 2: Chaos Kid]
Butta's cutting something
And when DJ Buttafingaz is on the turntable
All you other MC's and DJ's ain't nothing
Plus we got the (???), I'm sure
We catch you suckers fronting
Cuttin' it up so nice
Plus I got the rhyme styles and beef I kick precise
When I touch the mic, the audience be bumping it
Pumping it up
Never asking me to shut it down
Always give me a pound when I come into your town
I'm feeling nice
I got the rhyme styles that are precise
And I said that before, yo
Hit me with the cut twice

[Bridge]

[Outro]
Mission was successful, mothafucka!
It's only the beginning
Here's the cut that got you grinning
It's only the beginning
DJ Buttafingaz's cut has got you grinning...
