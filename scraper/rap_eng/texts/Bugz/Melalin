Should I do what they did,and take it and never admit
I invented the flow, yup, they different between us
You wait to shit come, I get it and go
Different strokes, for different folks, shit I ain't tryin'
To come up short like Arnold (Not at all)
Or will it just blow, like it did to coke (Not Me)
Some of us get rich,but many of us niggas is broke
The government, shit they make us sniff' coke
Instead of embracin' us, fuck savin' us, they give us the rope
How many guns in the hood? What the fuck you think
How can one another -- get ya stoned and then some weed
Just go, eight children broke, the statistics, every three hours
A brother is smoked, a baby is killed, a sister is raped
Somebody mother, strangled under that dope
Just get up and say, here, get up and pray
Tomorrow ain't promise, so I live for the day,this is hip hop
I need all, but tell ya rappers to come back, yea
We work too hard, to give us away, a victim of age
I can't go out like Eazy-E, a victim of AIDS
Being black is crime, I done worked, a nine to five
For three years, and they still, ain't give me a raise
Shit give me a gauge, fuck a mininum wage
Get in a helicopter, look down, shit we live in a maze
The day go fast, when ya broke, but it seems like
The minute you pay, the sun, never set
I don't sleep, cuz sleep is the cousin of death
So I wake up, my brother, my cousins, and uncle's that's left, yes!

After the war, there's casualties, I study  the art
They give us roaches and batteries, and blow you apart
Play dumb, procrastinate they assassinate those that are smart
Be brave, in the Wizard of Oz, they throw you a heart get some courage
To get to the light most walk through the dark, don't get discouraged
I'm on the one way trip to heaven, forget the luggage
Chest in pain, it's making me weak, it's making me sluggish
Besides weed clogging up my THC
In my hood, everybody got a PHD
I count on my fingers, how many niggas got a GED(Niggas NONE)
My life is worth more than TV, and the DVD
Fuck a CD, I wanna be free, money for free
I'm like a cat, caught in the tree, ok, I need help
Why do I do for others, when I know, that i should do for myself
Where were your friends when you needed them? they collapse
And i know the real ones if i need, but i don't ask for shit
I chuckled, pool game, Goodie Mob, Goodie L
Coke kid, frankly, GNC, respect yes
My brother Kenny, I will pay you back, forever you help me
I got the many mentions, it's yours, nigga the key to the drawers
So I work out, try to keep my endurance
We lips, looked out, when that nigga needed insurance
Lift it, G to E-N-T, Miss Pam, fuck feedin missy
I can cut down, for going to college, believing in me
I love you girl, you mean the world to me
