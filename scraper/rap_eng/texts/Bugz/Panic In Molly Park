[Hook: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

[Verse 1: Bugz]
Syllable sensei, biblical men pray
When this minister administer the sinister pen play
My brain waves stay ablaze, science undercover
Know the bay is my prey, moment of silence for my brothers
Yeah, moment of silence for my brothers
When they ran from the badge, now they lying under covers
Crying mothers from the crime of others hit the news quick
Copping 5-9 cause 9-5 couldn't do shit
Really still hollow, empty pills bottles made me
Back when auntie overdosed, comatose on suede sheets
My uncle a skeleton wearing skin clothes
Cause to him pills we're like O'Neil to free throws
Uncle flipping birds that don't fly, no beaks
While pimps getting pie off the thighs of a freak
You could sniff my bloodline and get high for a week
But fuck giving out fries with a drink
I'm a rhyme 'til I die or advised for a shrink
Every time I wake, I rhyme to get the cake
Promised pie in the sky, I'm just try'na get a plate, boy
Want girls and a mansion, but I ain't try'na play, boy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: JB]
Yeah, mystical relapse, a fifth of jack and a hit of whack to back
Two back to back make my lungs collapse
Pupils dilated, you could tell I was either high or faded
My destination was heaven's basement
In the clouds I try to say it cleverly where every around me
Try to better me but can't succeed
Yea they only try to give me what I need
But love couldn't satisfy a fiend
That's the honest truth
I'm letting out some secrets now, man the lyins loose
I lied to who ment the most, I would die for who I lost
But same shit different day
Tryna stay strong doing shit a different way, living life
Shit is better than just chillin here at home
Dwelling over bitches that I had a year ago
Oh fuck now I'm really on some Drake shit
I rather be real than be on some fake shit
Word up

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bugz]
Back again from the crack head den
Hes selling flows by the O's, buy the pack for ten
You get no hugs when you flesh and blood
But when you sing with the wings, you get blessed love
Spark beef, no minute steak, it'll take at the park meet
Where they draw heat, artists in the dark street
Lose ya mind, few pursue a fluent dime through the truest grind
It's ironic, homie robbed a rollie, now hes doing time
Live it up, many stuck, few will climb through the sewer grime, do a crime, who am I
I'm losing my dome, if I throw a suit on my bones
And go to funeral homes to view the few that I know, again
Many times it had happened to me
Shout out to Jay, shout out to Bobby, dog, whats happening, G
They wasn't taught from the best, when they walk with a vest
Didn't sell they white right, cause they snorted the rest
Sorta depress, in the fast lane, out the way quick
Waste clips to make your face drip
Without a trace dip like a makeshift spaceship was the getaway whip
Monopolize this thing, so I flow for the presents
Shine but no diamond in my necklace, never buy the bling
You don't recognize a king when he roams with the peasants
A starving artists giving you food for thought
Degenerates generating food for thought, who'd have thought
