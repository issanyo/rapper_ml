[Hook: La Peace]
This is 31 to [?]
We motivate
Live from Detroit City up in Michigan State
La Peace and Bugz bringin' that [?] analytical
Condition you MCs
Emergency 'cause it's critical
Through the eyes of a writer rap music appears different
We know the real lyricists
And the ones who be bullshittin'
Special teams and [?] definite with the skill
We get the honeys and moneys
Opposed to beef because you gots to chill

[Bugz:]
[?]
Be killin' a scrub
Not givin' a fuck
About the spillin' blood
I'm pickin' you up
Insert yo' ass inside a rug
Then dumpin' you off
Told you not to fuck wit' us
[?]
And crossed the line
And now you history
Put in a book as an unsolved mystery
In a way
I worked off your misery
No need to be upset
I kidnapped your ass anyway

And a getaway
Someday
I kill off the world eventually
Anyday
Imma blow my own head off
While I'm gettin' head off
While I'm gettin' head off
And do it right when I let off

My mind is way off
And gonna stay off
It's been that way since my layoff
[?]
Vile, Ill-mannered
Robbin' panhandlers
[?]

[Hook: La Peace]

[La Peace:]
La Peace, no question
I got tight lyrics [?]
My five minutes of funk
Makin' you jet after two and a half
Bustin' the [?] backwards rap with two mics
Like the professional with an aggressive flow
Very impressive so
I give the people what they want and how they want it
So if you want [?]
[?] the bullets put the [?] up on it
La Peace and Bugz bringin' trademark flows
Upon niggas and trick hoes
You know what it is
[?]
When it rains, don't it pour
So I'm givin' you more
Automatic we [?]
When we step on the floor
I get lump sums
Over these tight beats and drums
Sometimes I get a block
But then eventually it comes
Smokin' the Spanish Fly
Julio Iglesias must've laced this
My bilingual startin' to sound single

[Hook: La Peace]

[Bugz:]
Smash-mouth vocals
Burnin' holes for you locos
What the fuck you starin' at, folks?
[?]
Get out the orbit
[?] you can't afford it
The brain enormous
[?]
[?] planet's orbit
We'll burst you
Crush your dreams and hurt you
Make you wanna change your virtue

[La Peace:]
[?] run up on my my rhyme style
[?] cause every time I rhyme my rhymes
My delivery tricky and icky
[?] yo' brains on concrete
I'm mind blowin' [?]
Blowin' on hardcore beats
Live and direct
From the Detroit streets
La Peace [?]
Have you lookin' weak
Hope niggas start some beef
Wanna see [?]
[?] good good, bad bad and ugly
