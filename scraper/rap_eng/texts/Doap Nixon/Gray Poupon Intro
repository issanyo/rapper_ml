[Intro]
Yeah Scott, second time around (whoo)
Let's get this paper, baby
All day, Gray Poupon, indeed

[Verse 1: Doap Nixon]
Yo, yeah
They want the hood so I gave 'em the diesel
This time around gotta come more lethal
Pardon self, heads kept you waiting
But the game's more perverted than brothels in Canaan
No need to explain it
Nuff cats spoke of it, joked a bit
Willy talk we're broke as shit
My flow's legit
I promise you this album, Duke
I won't K West or Carl Thomas you
This here's a humdinger, Illadelph get money
From white boys to gunslingers
And the home's at right where the zone's at
Find a kid leg crossed where the throne's at
Live state, the five way, paper low we migrate
Crown size five eighth's
While your shit collect dust on the shelf
It's another classic tucked under my belt
(ugh)

[Outro]
Gray Poupon niggas
Science behind that: spread the bread
I got a whole city to co-sign my gangster
I'ma set the record straight: I'm a solo artist, Doap Nixon
I pull a milli on you
I ain't the Salvation Army niggas, I ain't donating nothing, stay off my style (indeed)
I'm hearing all these little Nixons, young Nixons
It's crazy, my whole family live, A.O.T.P
Most niggas ride dicks, we get money
This is all yeah (yeah), yes sir
I promise you
Gray Poupon
