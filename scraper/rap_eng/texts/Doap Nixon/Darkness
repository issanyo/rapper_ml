[Hook]

Been spending so much time underground
I guess my eyes adjusted
To the lack of light
I got covered in darkness
Covered in darkness

Hibernating always waiting for something new
Happinesss always ending
In the blink of an eye
There was no one attending
No one attending

[Verse 1]

First thing’s first, I Nixon, I gets money
And can’t never one of y’all take this s**t from me
They done tried but the ties became severed
Life got cold and darkness became pleasure
It’s sort of like a prison but can someone
Tell me the reason for living, what’s the mission?
Is it to grab more cash than the next man?
Pimps try and grab more ass than the next man
The hood’s like Thriller, could take a young kid
Off the football field and turn him into a killer, damn
It’s modern-day genocide when we die
They telling lies, the mystery, God lives in the sky
He’s in our heart, body, and spirit is energy
That co-exists with chemistry infinitely
If mind detect mind why we still talk babble
Plus degrees manifest ? master yeah

[Hook]

Been spending so much time underground
I guess my eyes adjusted
To the lack of light
I got covered in darkness
Covered in darkness

Hibernating always waiting for something new
Happinesss always ending
In the blink of an eye
There was no one attending
No one attending

[Verse 2]

My city’s streets is so vicious better change in a hurry
Ain’t enough medication for the brains that worry
They’re making more and more pills like it’s fixing the problem
When the side effects is worse than the original problem
I’m so tired, my body is weak, I can’t sleep
And my feelings got me so confused I can’t speak
The government promise help, cutting our healthcare
The media’s the terrorist producing more self-fear
If Bin Laden did what he did, why he still breathing?
Contradicting stories like the Jews who killed Jesus
Soldiers leave for war, come back paraplegics
N****s fighting for a war and don’t care for the reason
That ain’t me, Lord, Cassius Clay, send me to prison
I should’ve listened when the older gods hit me with wisdom
Now my intuition’s telling me address the problems
With the hope to find solutions, build domestic values, c’mon

[Hook]

Been spending so much time underground
I guess my eyes adjusted
To the lack of light
I got covered in darkness
Covered in darkness

Hibernating always waiting for something new
Happinesss always ending
In the blink of an eye
There was no one attending
No one attending

[Verse 3]

I ain’t the preacher man in ‘09 selling you dreams
Or the gypsies on the television promising cream
I’m just building with my insight a vision of light
Painting pictures of intuition with precision and might
Put a dollar in a bum’s cup, later he eating
And the one who threw the dollar need a cup cause he’s leaking
While we work all week and get bent on the weekend
Only to wake up Monday morning in the 25th precinct
I’m trying to show this rap game that cats slain
And most never get a shot at life cause they dealing with wack aim
So they leave school and go hard in the crack game
Till they on the bus the greatest four with their backs changed
