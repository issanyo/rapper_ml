(Chorus)
People now its all changing
All around I see it changing
When there nothing left
There's nothing left to say
The Lover dies love fades away
Uh-Uh (Remix) AOTP Shit what
People now its all changing
All around I see it changing (undefined)
When there nothing left (This is what y'all emails was about)
There's nothing left to say (all them hits on my page)
The Lover dies love fades away

Doap Nixon these rappers on they way out
I'm on my way in trynna get this bad taste out my mouth
Phoney regrets y'all dudes got the game on a down slide
Labels got ya all gassed thinkin ya sound fly
Ay y'all bitch but well gone run dry
Beats not bangin an yo hooks got one line
There's a time for everything so I lay back
Revenge is much sweeter when it's covered in payback
I get it in for my niggas that love rap
Yo fan base only stuck around for my comeback
Tell 'em I'm here an watch the whole game go nuts
City in a tight smash Philly has showed up
Y'all spit crooked cuz y'all raps don't fly straight
Ya flow only really built for myspace
The crown betta be 7n5/8ths
It's Doap Nixon nickel bag niggas can't violate

(Chorus)
Yo yo I give MC's rough beatins
I ain't home but I think a take over is much needed
Ya foods gone an ya cups leakin
Matta fact dawg step from the table cuz you done eatin
I made plans and I'm callin my shots
AOTP whole fam covered with rocks
An it's bug how y'all flea nigga's crawled in y'all spots
Got the game smellin foul cuz y'all startin to rot
Uh from the driz ash I bang with the kid ash
Eva try to front on Doap Nix and get split ash
They call me Doap cuz I burn like street pimp
Fresh out the box gave this john a face lift
Johns gone hate cuz I don't floss with tape flicks
Real rap flows and the doughs equations (Com'on)
Stop wilin cuz I know you lyin you sold 10 thou
I pushed that before I made my album

(Chorus)
Yo so spaz out if you feel me with both hands
Only show love fans and close fam
AOTP drop hits in all states
Palms stay ratchet tucked under the north face
An I spit heavy my nigga Paz said two words get ready
Syze gave me the cue, Crypt gave me the sign
Sunshine like a handful of dimes
But before I cam y'all niggas forgot me
I'm cocky take more than rules to stop me
I rain on the pussy's for spittin that whack shit
Me I paid dues y'all payin them taxes
Me I'm a cannon y'all niggas is ratchets
That jam up brick nothin can save ya
Fall back quick watch the scales tip in my fava
It ain't about my dough it's becuza my flava
(Lets get it, get it)

(Chorus)
