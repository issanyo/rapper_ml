[Intro: Blacastan]
Yeah
You are now tuned into the Doap Trafficking experience
(keep it locked right here)
See this is something that's been going on for a long time, forever
They don't understand man
It's deeper than rap man
This is what cartels are made of right here
(pharaoh clique)
Domination

[Verse 1: Blacastan]
This is the last dream of a dying machine
We the ultimate team
Me and Doap is like Cyclops and Wolverine
The gestapo couldn't stop our regime
We dope trafficking, getting this cream
I can't stand a new school nigga that act wild
Fuck around and get smoked like a crack vial
We in the spot chopping and bagging
Or in the mall shopping and bragging
You a snitch bro
Turn stakes now you running with the captain
Secret service, Illuminati
Niggas get nervous when they see Doap and Blac in a party (indeed)
Captain Picard on a bottle of Bacardi
Starship Enterprise
Long dicks mesmerize
Laser beam paralyze
Bitches with thick thighs
Getting sucked in the Swiss Alps
Blowing backs out, twisting scalps
Doap Trafficking
(Hahahaha)

[Outro]
Yeah
I tried to tell em Doap [Blacastan]
I make these niggas man, get a day's math man
They don't wanna get in over they heads man [Blacastan]
Five different ways man and they better include the one of forty
Lost and found Muslim lesson 2
O.P.G. man
That's how real niggas do man
They let their right hand do what their left hand can fall back with, you know what I'm saying?
Doap Trafficking, Blacastan, Doap Nixon
Yo Blac man, let's get into this album
