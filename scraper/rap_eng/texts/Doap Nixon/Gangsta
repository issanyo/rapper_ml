(Intro) Doap
Yeah, AOTP, that's gangsta nigga
Sour Diesel the album is here
Yeah, uh

[Doap Nixon]
Tempo take, no shirt wit a cold smirk
A J A, runaway babe wit no shirt
Shady endeavors, you play me neva
I'mma product of my environment plus the 80's era
Buckin' half lip, gas spit when the grass lit
Sour Diesel trippin' off acid
That's the way my youngins play, they so loco
They transport their work in coffee beans from SoHo
Then what?
So what you think you tellin' us wit them jail threats
We know how to bids scrap, know how to live scrap
Dudes got bright ideas till they get wig clapped
This games just a big trap
Full of lil' kids rap
And it's all the same; they do a video, bling-bling
Then they go pawn their chains (Faggots)
So we don't care about y'all dudes that rap hard
Y'all names up in bright lights and mines is on a black card
That's gangsta nigga

[Demoz]
Ayo I fuck wit the beat like, wouldn't do this acapella
Bitches lookin' at my ways, they look like helicopter propellers
Fuck you mean you gettin' mozzarella
You payed a hundred for them jeans, them bitch's Rocafella
Hella weed in my dutch got me medicated
Meditated bitch, niggas hatin' cuz I'm educated
Street smart, we fart, nigga I am elevated
Floatin' like a helium baloon without my head inflated
This shit you rap about other niggas laugh about
I'm hungry so I'm clappin' out
Ya adam till the apple's out
Pills and apple juice, you pissin' I just have to ask
It's funny so I have to brag
You shittin' in a plastic bag
You'se a faggot man, I'll clap you like a Pakistan
A rope around ya neck
I'll hold you up like a traffic jam
Trash ya man if I'm Diesel wit the gun

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
Geah, Nixon, I got you baby, it's Cauze

Niggas is trash, betta step ya bars up
Broke outta jail, told 'em step their bars up
Ya haze is two base, step your jars up
Break ya face up chump, step your jaw up
All Chucks, my true flame niggas
Buss thru ya fuckin' wall like that Kool Aid nigga
Oh-yeah, the rest ought to know
I'm the best and you a flake like fresh fallin' snow
(Fuckin' flake ass chump, Hollywood niggas)
I'm 26 but in the game about five of those
Wars, tours, albums, got five of those
So pay homage, don't let me catch you poppin' shit
Cuz I'll kill ya career before you drop a disc
Who hot as this? Bring me to meet the nigga
I'll beast, battered, deep fried eat the nigga
King Kong, Chewbacca straight beastin' nigga
You talk greasy, but I just don't believe you niggas
Me neither, nope!

[Planetary]
Before I get caught by the Federally's
I move my family to Cali
You pushin' kush in the alley
I'm pushin' 08 Denali's
I'm ridin' out like a renegade
Reef rockin' shotty
We got a trunk full of hand grenades to dismantle ya body
You niggas rappin' like you ain't been potty trained
I got pots to piss in, niggas step ya polly game
Gas high, but fuck that, I don't ride the train
If I can't afford it, I start recordin' a lotta flame
(You know they had to invite Planet nigga!)
I'm Mike Jordan on top of my game
That's why I treat Nixon like Pippen
Cuz wit 'em they can't stop my reign
This shit gangsta, lemme explain that
Demoz will cut ya and leave you framed at the train tracks
You all bloody and tied up to the third rail
Cryin' for ya momma, but the drama where you first fell
You too feminine, take it to the grave witcha
When ya head detach, I'mma laugh and Paz take the pictures
This shit gangsta
