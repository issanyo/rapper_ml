What happened to the fresh crews of hip hop
Nowadays rap niggas' are funny like Chris Rock
They think about fashion more than music
And wonder why nobody wanna support their music
We hate their music
Throw away their music
It was left in my hands you can say I blew it
So I am speaking no
Searching for remedies
Get this game where it needs to be
What it means to me gave me my whole steez
Trip party jingle like
No cheese
Watching Chuck D, Das FX and Ma$e
Staring at a poster of Roxanne Shante
Erik B & Rakim taught me how to get paid
"Take these words home and think it through
For all of those who wanna profile and pose
These words might be about you
Don't make me have to call your name out"
I couldn't leave without my radio LL made you jingle
When he first drop the single
It was too young for me to step in
Break dancing was a thing of the past
Kool G Rap had me thinking about keys
Road to the richest
Mouthpiece
New emcess had me blowing on blue cheese
Where would have be without
Where will be without Kool Herc
Scott La Rock, Jazzy Jeff, and DJ Red Alert
Already know what it means to me
Sour Diesel showed y'all how real music should be
Ever see a Nas show in his prime
Or the B.I.G came to your city to rhyme
Wasn't about how many slugs you had
Was about the energy, all the thugs were glad
Everybody had their Fila suits on
Rap music express how the hood feels
Nowadays need lawyers for a good deal
Everything gotta change my nigga
But it change to a mess
These artists started dressing retarded
Just to see their name one week on the chartlist
So their names get used for the market
Claiming gangsta fake niggas is heartless
