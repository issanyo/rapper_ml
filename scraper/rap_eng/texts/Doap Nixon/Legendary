[Hook: Doap Nixon]
Nobody understands my brain
Nobody wants to feel the pain

But when you legendary, you leave your mark

[Verse 1: Doap Nixon]
My whole life I tried to give you my best
Waking every morning with the phlegm in my chest
Smoking back to back, tried to make you a track
Putting CDs in stores just to take the shit back
But I held on and it felt wrong
Other dudes tried to use my flow but it felt wrong
It all started with the Fivers, C-walks
Memories of sharks even sharper once the leaves spark
That's why I don't knock when they blow heavy
At an early age I knew I was legendary
I just lacked the confidence
But I kept that flow that'll burn like acid bitch
But the cream wasn't adding up
From south street to [?] I fucked cyphers up
There was a few heads in the hood that rapped
They called themselves 5-6 and the dudes clapped
But we never had a chance to link up
I still ran with the corner boys with the Brink's trucks
I was known as the rap cat that clapped at any nigga that commit a rat act
While the kid was acting stupid
Them other dudes on the other side of town was making music
I'ma give you the truth
I recall that day when Paz said "Streets or the booth?"
Ever since then we been on top
While the other cats in our hood pray we all flop
A.O.T.P. is real
O.P.G. just another outlet to show we got skill
From [?] to Ap, O.S. to Paz
Can't forget Demoz or King Mag
I can't forget King Syze
My brother Celph Titled my word that's my blood God
We all started off close, we got closer
Through the years linked up with Coka Nostra
Y'all niggas can't stop the bum rush
Only cats that can stop us, is us
I watch other crews fall apart
That shit won't happen to us cuz we all got heart
Yeah Nixon is heavy without the fetti
That's my word I'm legendary

[Hook x3]

[Outro: Doap Nixon]
A.O.T.P
O.P.G
I'm talking about all of us
What up Burke the Jerk
What up Eso, Apathy
Vin Laden (there's a lot of us) O.S., King Syze, King Mag
Demoz, Demoz
My brother Blacastan, PEACE

Yeah Nixon is heavy without the fetti
That's my word I'm legendary
