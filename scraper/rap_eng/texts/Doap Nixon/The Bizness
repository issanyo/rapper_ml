[Intro: Blacastan]
Hey yo Doap
Hey yo Doap
These niggas is cooking with lard, ock
They cooking with lard
Stop f'Allah ockey
What they doing ock?

[Verse 1: Blacastan]
We fouler than them niggas from the Cobra Kai dojo
Snatch bitches outta kimonos, lay pogo, no homo
Everything I write's brutal
I throw ten at your wife's noodle Singapore rice noodles
They acting like I won't clap at the pigs
Wiling out like I dipped a whole packet of cigs
Shit I bootleg my own shit like an African
It's Blac, Eso, and Nix, we doap trafficking
Shell spits in your face, you won't laugh again
You said you God body right, well do the math again
We stack squids like Pablo with milked out diablos
Heh, my niggas be the williest
From CT to Philly, my affiliates is O.P.G
That's A.O.T.P., that's D.T.Z.,
I represent U.E
Hear me, pass the cake, clear me, family

[Hook]
Let me tell ya bout the business...
(scratching and repeat)
The product is dope

[Verse 2: Doap Nixon]
My whole life I thought a bitch put a hex on me
Voodoo doll shit, clapping any Mexican
Crack fiends getting paid for messages
You paint pictures but your colors is wrong
Denalis in the parking lot, the willies is [?]
Gods 30 deep and they all gorilla strong
There's real shit been calling me
These new niggas is rapping, but they ain't half as hard as me
Too many gimmicks and they music is trash
On this Earth just passed 10 carats and ash
That's that Liberace, we don't rock Versace (what you cop?)
Cop my white tee from the ockeys
I swear there ain't many dudes that can hang with me
Call my up top fam come and bang with me (Eso!)
Esoteric's a vet, Blacastan is my witness
And y'all pussies get tha business

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Esoteric]
Who want it with Doap, Blac, and E-S?
Hey yo I take him to the ledge
Hang him off the cliff, show him death
Lyrics brolick like Shrek with that ogre breath
Boba Fett, Robotech
Back of the lab of vocalists
You back in the game but focus less
You really hoping less
Pick a game, any game
Poker, chess, I poke your chest
Hope and flesh with Storm Shadow weapons, keep stepping
All my Philly Pharaoh fam, gotta keep reppin
And we better than evil, clever and evil
I'm a veteran people rocking Loeb's
You won't find me in American Eagle
I'm deadly like a heroin needle
You heard the Boston Pharaoh, got you fearing a sequel
Now listen, I won't try to rehabilitate y'all or facilitate y'all or silver tape y'all
The harder they come the iller they fall
Giving y'all the business
But this ain't the type of company you really want, is it?
