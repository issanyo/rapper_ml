Verse 1:
I write lyrics that'll seduce Medusa
Produce world insanity, change the human future Pick up the pen without touching it physically
And then leak body fluids, pardon my speech Now granted, I'm every murder that happened on the planet
Running rampant, I'm making this money to take advantage  I rap just like laying in the ghetto on a hammock
My metaphors are causing panic, my eyes slanted  I just booked a Chinese chick that looks Spanish
And me getting head in the car is so romantic Top seat Indian chief that's bout his brief case
Cash Flows selling out shows over eBay  Press play at ya own risk
Watch the game evolve backwards, swallowed by my own gift Without a gun I could still shoot the breeze
Every sentence is another disease… 90

Hook (x2):
This a time when the rap was so classic
Turn a rap fan into addicts
The style created was so captive
The flow and the beats were like magic

Verse 2:
Verbal safari in the jungles of illuminati
I treat the rhythm like it's origami, or… I treat the rhythm like some strippers at a party
I'm smoother than a foreign coffee, bitch get off me Lavish in a lavender Benz, this flow is endless
Body music, so I plead the 5th amendment  Me, I love the ghetto, but I rhyme with its resentment
Free as a sentence, smoking weed at the entrance Black power in the thoughts of Eisenhower
Or a plane through the eiffel tower, I'm living cocaine  I'm that ni**a in the 80's wit a rope chain
Die righteous, but living in the dope game Six cylinder life is all sinister
Stab with a prisoner's knife solo enigma  The best lyricist has now entered
I'm the real around a bunch of pretenders... 90

Hook (x2):
This a time when the rap was so classic
Turn a rap fan into addicts
The style created was so captive
The flow and the beats were like magic

Verse 3:
It is what it is, is life's license, smoking to fight titans
I'm better off fighting a Mike Tyson I live what I'm writing, I'm caught between a bullet and a Heineken
Illa the Einstein, raps nitrogen Cash out before the Grim Reaper cashes in
Life's a bitch, or better yet a Kardashian Each verse is a place where the past begins
Spoken acid, wrote it in its natural sin Each rap beyond mars, spit a car jacking
This is diction, friction, a new addiction Steps ahead, got it made like I'm Special Ed
Or Dapper Dan, super hero rapper man Wrap 'em up like a boxers hand
Box cutter, the Illa pops off like a rubber band Bottom line, I'm the man
I'm making it do what it do, do what I can

Hook (x2):
This a time when the rap was so classic
Turn a rap fan into addicts
The style created was so captive
The flow and the beats were like magic
