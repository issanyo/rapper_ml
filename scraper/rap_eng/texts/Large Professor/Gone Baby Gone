(Verse 1)
Wilted flowers in tenement towers seek water to grow in summer for their father [?]
Nothing but unstoppable obstacles, blocked roads, potholes
God only knows if this .44 or prison door is. (Yeah)
Bullet showers from venomous policies
Watch for the blow in those who got the goal of hunting 'cause it's profitable
Cops on patrol bust at your opticals to blind your vision
Mind your business 'fore you found imprisoned. I'm

(Chorus)
Seeing system clear, this the year shit get real critical
They listen but they ain't hearin' the lyricals
They listen but they ain't hearin' the lyricals
They listen, but, they ain't hearin' what
He say, he say, he say, these kids these days is gone, baby gone
(He say, he say, he say, these kids these days is gone, baby gone)

(Verse 2)
Rose in concrete, trampled underneath your feet for the umpteenth time in just one week
They bust heat, then moms weep. Blood trickle 'pon street is cyclical
'Cause we repeat the tendencies of weak people mentally
Shootouts, can't afford it, aborted, boys wanna be girls, tryna tune out, can't avoid it
They sellin' us the dream, and we buyin' it by any means. Guess this make checkmate to Queens
I guess this make checkmate to Queens, they let Satan scheme, fuck knowledge, chase green
And though it seem legal tender tend to render things cool, it ain't true, jedi mind tricks they do
But I'm on to these dudes. See the military monetary profits in this logic to blindfold the optics

(Chorus)
See the system clear, this the year shit get real critical
They listen but they ain't hearin' the lyricals
They listen but they ain't hearin' the lyricals
They listen, but, they ain't hearin' what
He say, he say, he say, these kids these days is gone, baby gone
(He say, he say, he say, these kids these days is gone, baby gone)

(Verse 3)
Bruce Jenner cut the genitals, my lyricals amaze. Influencer mixed with AIDS, razorblades in lemonade
Pays these days to be mediocre, future in fugaze, KKK klan meeting
We seeing they face on the television, planet killing, eliminate race
Found water on the red rock, they sending 'em to space
And in place of the cold war: drug war- the rush for a war on terrorists
Mount Rushmore represents pure idol worship
Upon an idle warship radicals are on sabbatical
Elite forces feed horseshit as courses
Of course we endorse it. America Online doing fine being blind. And I'm

(Chorus)
Seeing system clear, this the year shit get real critical
They listen but they ain't hearin' the lyricals
They listen but they ain't hearin' the lyricals
They listen, but, they ain't hearin' what
He say, he say, he say, these kids these days is gone, baby gone
(He say, he say, he say, these kids these days is gone, baby gone)
