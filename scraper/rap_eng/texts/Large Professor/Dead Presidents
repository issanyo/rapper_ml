Uh, Wooo, Roc-a-fella y'all
But it's not that fella y'all

[Verse 1: Benny Boy]
It's Dead Presidents that represent Benevolent
Being broke's a definite, I'm coming out a deficit
People said I better get something to be clever with
Picked up a pen and pad, and I've been clever ever since
Listen I'm intelligent, my lyrics is my evidence
Who you know is better with connecting words and predicates
As soon as you let him spit, It's already evident
Rapper's about to reach the level, I'm a step ahead of it
I'll never get respected if I rip a mic pitiful
Sick of struggling and sick of living life miserable
Sick of having backyards and unpurchased swimming pools
Sick of growing up in an unfurnished living room
Sick of being judged as a common street criminal
Really want to know me well? Here's a vivid visual
I am not typical, I'm original
The little fool is a lyrical individual
Grip a few microphones and leave conditions critical
Even though I'm minimal and all I do is ridicule
Take this statement literal, I'll tell you what I'm giving you
Here to send the message, but the message ain't subliminal
Little dude is miniscule, but he's still an MC
I'm Benevolent, and I spit benevolently
Smiling to the world if the world is all against me
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me, What?!
