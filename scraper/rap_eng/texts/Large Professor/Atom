My 4-9-3-11 has fleas cause when I'm kicking the lip service
Someone signs up to rush the potteries
It's automatic and apparent that we have skills in this
But people tend to miss when we shoot the gift
It's not to imitate another and mimic
That's slouch life to crush a bad gimmick
We like to shoot the breeze the Main Source way
We don't portray another and never will perpetrate any horseplay
Meaning, that if there's a special request
For the Main Source to bite, don't hold your breath
Routines are the lessons, any questions?
We're kicking essence, the Main Source breaks the atom

Since I'm part of the Source, others try to find a lunch
In the passages kicked by me, but I don't crunch
They know what I publish ain't rubbish, it's soon to fit a day
I find kids to tutor and away
They go through my book, look, pick and snatch
But I can understand cause they create chicken scratch
The center of attention, kids keep flinching
Phony like an extension, trying to front like they getting attention
But at the same time dumbfounded
They started idolizing the Source as soon as their drums sounded
The Actuals intervened to tell you that, um...
The Main Source breaks the atom

We're not the best cause no one should be considered a champ
We're the Source and so-called comp will receive a stamp
For playing participation and also for being noticed
The camera's on you, chief, so don't blow this, homes
By looking and peeking, cause if you wanna stay in Hell
As quick as I give you howdy, I bid you farewell
You'd better think before you break cause if you step to us
That'll be the very last step you take
Consider yourself the outer shell of a ding-a-ling part
What we write will bang in your heart
Grab your place in line, get your application signed
And in due time, you'll find, the Main Source breaks atom
