On the 9th of reborn resurrected and fresh
Like the world's greatest thinkers collaborated in death
Escape death, I take your soul on a journey
I analyze it wise enough to show what don't concern me
Bright horizons welcome to a new dawn
Trying to get this guap before these country's get their neuc on
Times is hard like elephant tusk
See me bopping down the block smell Egyptian musk
I'm just a builder, feed you then I can lead you
If God's in your mind you don't need a cathedral
Can't be miserable waiting on miracles
I'm your unknown self made visible
Whatever you believe you can still be deceived
And thats ever since the Genesis to Adam and Eve
Go inside yourself to find motivation
'Cause meditation can bring elevation

Hook
Time to eat, there's tracks to devour
'Cause everything changed when the planes hit them towers
I'm a have to build with you in the 9th hour
It's call mind power

It's time for a change and that ain't no mystery
First step to walking the path is simplicity
You need light like it's oxygen
From the hearts of God to the hearts of men
Now lets build, strategically move like generals
Energy's back with the vitamins and minerals
Stay positive focus on the good cause
And everybody in the mosque with Clif bars
The bubble jacket that match with the kufi
The Timberlands tight twisting up on the loose leaf
Walking in peace ain't no need for a firearm
Just predictions Revelations of John
Every verse like a Psalm or a song from David
With no interruptions they're calmly stated
Leave a might? mark every country I travel in
K dot S this is rap's King Solomon

Hook
Time to eat, there's tracks to devour
'Cause everything changed when the planes hit them towers
I'm a have to build with you in the 9th hour
It's called mind power

Stacks of beat CDs trying to find singles
Up inside the lab on point like triangles
Crafted the flow came back with the same force
Got you looking at the front door like Main Source
And the cause is symbolic ex-alcoholic
With expertise on beats that's brollic
And I know I just flow you can go call it
I'm never going leave or linger around like garlic
Been around the world like Magellan ex-felon
Switched up the style dropping gems from the cerebelum
For the brown white and all the black faces
It's time to take it back to shell toes and fat laces
Everyday battles on the back of stair cases
Who's that cat the most merciful the most gracious?
Represent the attributes, in the off-white leather
Hopping out the coupe now let's go

Hook
Time to eat, there's tracks to devour
'Cause everything changed when the planes hit them towers
I'm a have to build with you in the 9th hour
It's called mind power
