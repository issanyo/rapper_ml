[Verse One]
Play it again Polo, cause I just can't stand still
I burn while the tables turn like windmills
A swift reactor rap, to impact of a tractor trailer
I flow like a sailor
Rhymes remain hittin' hard like Night Train
With lyrics that came from the brain of Mark Twain
So if you can't handle the man, please go and change the channel
Rappers are gettin' smoked like Camels
Prepare for the brainstorm, fellas better grab your umbrellas
People run inside your cellars
As I teach you're attached to my rhyme like a leech
Takin the S off my speech to write peach
Take the P off the peach because now you want each
And every rhyme to teach and reach
You need a fixin', for your fake rhymes, lyrics, and weak mixin'
You robbin' 'em blind like Nixon
Some got shook when they took a look
I'm burnin' you up, like the lyrics that are pages of a cookbook
I attract more kids than Wonderama
Rhymes got more drama, than Black Mama, White Mama
You get defeated, decapitated, captivated
Cause you hated the fact G. Rap made it
So if you slow you blow like a ho, so here's a solo
Hey yo, play it again Polo

[Verse Two]
Here's a fellow, sayin' hello, Polo, mellow
P-O-L-O, shake em like Jell-o
Sonny you're funny like Johnny Carson
So I'mma enjoy, watchin' your butt burn up just like an arson
These rhymes here can kill sonny
You try to rip, so just call me the name of Flip Wilson
And rhymes I got 'em down pat
Release this hit like the *Super Fly* soundtrack
Too dope of a type windpipe full of hype
And I sideswipe the suckers I snipe
The mic so hot, it can weld with a cell
And assassinate, like Lee Harvey Oswald
Whether the radio, Sony or Sanyo
Rappers get slayed and played like a banjo
When I illustrate, still a rhyme is iller
Battle me, you better swallow a bottle of painkillers
I go faster and faster, skills of a Grandmaster
Makin' you fall like plaster
Amazed, grammar plays like gamma rays
Chumps are caught in the blaze and dumped in ashtrays
You pussy willow, I can see your silhouette
You're scared, and tears and fears made your pillow wet
You wanna tic-tac-toe with a big rap pro?
Yo, play it again Polo

[Verse Three]
Guys are weary, eyes be teary, surprised and leery
Your rhymes are eerie, that's my theory
I'm here to jam, slam like Bam-Bam
Damn, Polo play it again like Sam
Cuts in harmony, you ain't harmin' me
Your beats are moist and your sweet voice is charmin' me
Not flexible, your style needs to be twisted
Plus your name's unlisted
Rhymes are tough like gristle, watch the boy sizzle
Your brainstorms don't even drizzle
But my brainstorms gives lots of pain, lots of rain
Long spins, the strong winds of a hurricane
You get sunken when I hit a punk and
Rag a fag, makin' him stagger like he's drunken
You can't stop treatin' my hip-hop
Like a Blow Pop, chew up the slop like a gumdrop
Makin you sweat like a death threat, slow when I flow
I'mma let, Polo wet up the whole set
Yes the final death wish to sucker MCs
Gets granted, with rhymes makin 'em stand planted
I start blowin' blows, and my rhymes are like a bolo
So hey, play it again Polo
