[Verse 1]
Every Friday we'd turn off the TV and slide away
The loveseat, Pops would nod to the beat
Me and sis would insist which record was next
While Moms tapped her feet on the floor, God bless
We lived in the tall building complex
Up the block from the Unisphere, there
Is where I started, to manslaughter
Dance steps on the floor to Bambaataa, looking for the
Perfect beat, Marvin Gaye, fish full of mercury
Blasted out them speakers while my new sneakers
Shrieked and screeched moonwalking to the tune's organ
So much music love in this little apartment
Had jazz, soul, blues and hip hop
Moms drunk booze, Pops puffed zip loc
Bags of grass, or green, as recent as it seem
A blast from the past

[Hook] x4
It was all a dream

[Verse 2]
Me and her, she and I, had started seeing eye
To eye, one day when I was cooling with my guy
Q-Tip uptown, was feeling kinda down
My brother rolled through and said "Let's ride around"
Had just broke up with the rap group
Was ready to black boot-stomp motherfuckers but dat route
Was mad illogical and God came to me in a vision
Saying "Here, now Tribe's your crew"
Back to driving through Harlem with the Abstract
Seen her on the hunt, 45th with the ass fat
And the tits big, "Yo what's this kid?
You better slow down, it's about to go down"
Pulled the car over and I
Proceeded to the female and began to thread the needle through the eye
A few years later in Queens

[Hook] x4
It was all a dream

[Verse 3]
When I met you, I was in awe cause you was that dude
Now I see pictures on the wall and peeps tattoo
Your face on body parts, you in the bay on trolley carts
Heard you playing during Mardi Gras
You everywhere, yeah, that was the mission
On the streets with your peeps, no parents' permission
Getting high, getting by off a little street money
I identify with that, cause we one and
The same, aside from similarity in name
1972, we both the same age
Broke the same cage and will reign in history
Those responsible still remain a mystery
The way it went down makes me raise my fist at the
Lack of love, seems like only yesterday
I met up with Busta go and get a chip phone
He said "Follow me," jumped in the whip, we hit the road
He made a quick stop by St. James and Green
You got out and said, "What's up with some beats?"
It was all a dream, and dreams don't die
