[Verse 1]
I'm called the Mad Scientist Extra P
About to set up shop and drop this next degree
On the masses, yeah it's the live guy with glasses
In Flushing, know for programming and percussion
Basslines are set now check me out and I'll bet ya
The one that claims that he's the best can't catch a
Beat like I catch it cause it's downright wretched
Put it through the S-950 then stretch it
To create the great type of shit to fit
My reputation's full-fledged, yo, zip the lip
I'm about to set it on society, watch me while I do it
My man I've been through it and don't know many who would
Be able to survive half the things that I've
Gone through the born true and living, though I'm driven
By everything real and I know how to deal
You think I'm lying? It's the Mad Scientist

[Chorus] (x3)
The Mad Scientist

[Verse 2]
Never had a basement, never had an attic
Only an apartment where I forever had static
For me doing a beat, it got threw in the street
Even put in a cell living in hip-hop hell
So far in my career, but I'm still here
To organize for your eyes and drop science on your ear
A strong black rebel, who loves the track level
Kinda loud, so turn it up so I can find a crowd to rock
And I'll concoct something ill for real
Come into my laboratory where you can't stand still
And the funk keeps banging, all my peeps hanging
On the block this one's for you, it's time to rock
On a higher plateau, and I supply a fat show wherever I go
Yo, you can't front on, flake, or even try and diss
Your man Large Profess' the Mad Scientist

[Chorus] (x3)
The Mad Scientist

[Verse 1 repeated]
I'm called the Mad Scientist Extra P
About to set up shop and drop this next degree
On the masses, yeah it's the live guy with glasses
In Flushing, know for programming and percussion
Basslines are set now check me out and I'll bet ya
The one that claims that he's the best can't catch a
Beat like I catch it cause it's downright wretched
Put it through the S-950 then stretch it
To create the great type of shit to fit
My reputation's full-fledged, yo, zip the lip
I'm about to set it on society, watch me while I do it
My man I've been through it and don't know many who would
Be able to survive after things that I've
Gone through the born true and living, though I'm driven
By everything real and I know how to deal
You think I'm lying? It's the Mad Scientist

[Outro]
I'll never die in this, the Mad Scientist
You can't try and diss the Mad Scientist
Or ever fry and crisp the Mad Scientist
Yeah, yeah
