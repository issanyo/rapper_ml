[Verse 1: Large Pro]
Kool
Just like the breeze on the ocean
You guys want to be like me? You need devotion
Some night and day skills and a whole lot of heart
And you got to be strong to hold down the part
That I'm holding
Straight out the flicks I'm golden
When numb girls be on my dick I got a Trojan
Not a single cat, rat or roach and
My category prepare for the explosion
Ka-Boom
Give me some elbow room
God said everybody in this world gon' bloom
And blossom
Thats it cause dudes is playing possum
Always act brand new i wouldn't gas em
Queens group therapy
Who's on tour
Guarantee i have the crowd saying "do an encore"
I'm persistent, come through hardcore
Get mad rich on those dudes that's unsure
Kool

[Verse 2: Large Pro]
Spinning round and round with my potion
Like Smokey Robinson kid i got the notion
One day when i was spinning in the whip tight posting
At the maximum speed like chicks like motion
P like the green stuff
Especially cabbage
And i slang that slang stuff better than average
Act stupid and i turn into veteran savage
Yo I'm saying I'm fucking putting heads in the garbage
Not a tyrant
But an MC just like Pirate
See me on the Tv as the black private
Detective
Many can't see his perspective
That's why the man Ex-P has been selected
On the jukebox
All you hearing is fake 2pacs
Talking like they brand new out the box
Stop the madness
Y'all some fake guild of radness
All i want you to do is feel the blackness
Kool

[Verse 3: Large Pro]
I be the black laid back on a friday night
Tuning in on the heavy-weights as they fight
For a belt and some cash and they spot in the light
Just thinking to myself "kid you gotta get right"
All the years you out in this bullshit business
You gotta give these cats a miracle to witness
For real
You the one that got blessed with skill
No time to be thinking about the next man
Still
You extend a helping hand
You not a selfish man
They try to work you over
But you was built to stand
On the highest heights
Penthouse levels
And how before they went out just like devils
It's typical
You dig back in the Biblical
Stories
That'll put your mind at ease
With the happen
This here is deeper than rapping
Its time to be free
Ex-P i be the captain
It's Kool
