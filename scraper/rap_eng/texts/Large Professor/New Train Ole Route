[Verse 1]
I was waiting by the door, then I entered
And it was by the great Paul C I was mentored
A lot of f-flash and cash been tended
That was a new day when the ones who invented
The game is getting overshadowed by lame
Executives, but I remain in the record biz
Twenty-some odd years and still counting
Could build a mountain with one hand and fill a fountain
Of youth with the other, my brother
Don't disrespect me, I was on TV
When they was in diapers, we was in nightclubs
Didn't care about marketing or hype cause
It was all natural, laying them tracks dude
For you to ride on, I'll click a firearm
On anybody that's trying to divide our culture
Remember these few words I quote you

[Hook] x2
You're new train running the ole route
Just ask them old G's what it's all about
Been there, blowing smoke in the air
Money, women, cars everywhere

[Verse 2]
They want the 90s, we give em 90s
In the 90s, live to 90s
In the 90s, we live to 90s
Was the 90s in the 90s
Anytime I land safely, I feel eight feet tall
Give my thanks to God and recall
What the right brothers did for us, indigenous
With North Carolina, we all got a finer
Thing to be grateful for
Like a sign of the times, or a 9 to 5, or an 8 to 4
I'm Paid in Full, Eric B. and Rakim
Thankful no one is telling me to lock in
From a block in the Q I bring you
Out of the darkness with more hot product
In honor of those before, E Pluribus Unum
We used to lash out and goon em
But now we more civilized for the enterprise
Got the milkshake, burger, and the fries
We need to analyze how this world got spoiled
And give thanks to those that's before you

[Hook] x2
