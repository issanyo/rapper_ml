[Intro]
As I look around at all my brothers and sisters, I realise that I am him, and him is I

[Bridge]
I am him, and him is I, and we are one all together
I am she and she is I, and we must work all together

Let me talk to 'em...

[Verse 1]
If you found out at the end there was no heaven to earn
No fire and brimstone for sinners to burn
If there was no award or punishment after death
Would you still be in the pews every Sunday on your best
Behaviour, lookin' for a saviour, but He can't save ya
'Cause you forgot He gave ya
A god within, yeah God's in the skin
We all flawed, but could still call God a twin
And we are all we need, so we understand
We must demand our own promise land [?]
It's so much easier than livin' a lie:
That everything is just a product of a guy in the sky
But, we are miracles - walkin' miracles
And we can write our own parables
'Cause we create the status quo
Eve was in the Garden and she chose to know
And I can't even be mad at that; she chose to grow
Let's go

[Hook x2]
I am is him, and him is I
I am she and she is I

Uh, uh

[Bridge]
Damn, I remember the weather
I learned a lot that September
They took me in as a member
They got us all to surrender
They was my kin, but they was thirsty for sin
Love on the surface, but judgin' within
Come as you are then they say shame where you been
No room for questions their patience is thin

[Verse 2]
Ha, but I ain't bring a gun today
Come in peace for my people, nigga, namast√©
I love the Earth and celebrate it like my momma's day
Then elevate my generation from atrocity
Anomaly, and my status is active
You stuck in the theory while we livin' in practice
Ain't a Baptist, but I pray like mantis
Destination somewhere; not on your atlas
Catch this

[Hook x2]
