[Verse 1: Large Professor]
Alive from the intro, I rhyme to the tempo
Aligned kid, I get low, my mind playing tricks? no
Everything's real when Professor connects
I domineer, steer clear of the moving targets
Been doing this forever, come through and spit whatever
I want to, used to start the rhyme with one cue
But now they start with O, the human bar code
Kids can't wait to see the great Large Pro
Fake rap niggas, sit back and relax
I got this, like a locksmith and I take tax
To the government, loving it, like a pack of DoubleMints
Spear-a-Mint, I grab the mic and start airing it
Out, no doubt, rock with Golden School excellence
Lotta what y'all call rap, I call excrement
Hardcore testament is what I blow
To the World Wide Web, street blocks, and to the globe

[Verse 2: Large Professor]
Yo God, break down the science on that...
Reliving, and thankful for this day we given
To hear another Large Pro track, driving through your cul-de-sac
Love to the peeps around the world that notice, that's
On the live guy that chops snares up and open hats
Reliving, ghetto-made, we live it
Mad scientist of rap on the main street pivot
Any time I touch down, it's a major exhibit
Of skills, and on the wills, I'm a great beat wizard
Go from zero to one million in no time
Down the block they be telling me, "It's your time"
Grab a bottle of the bubbly then it's show time
Scream on you like Gator, that's your job
In my everyday apparel I be dressed so sharp
Tell em not to check the balance, they can just go shop
Kick slang from the 70s, this sure shot
What I'm saying be definitely scorching it hot
Legend, I let the top grow, then edge it
Bringing heat to the game was my sole intention
I'm a shareholder, quick to get the file from out the folder
Load it up, blow it up, and then air to South Dakota
So pardon this, I take to school the insubordinates
Honestly yo, ain't nothing as important as
Life, and on Earth, peace creates Heaven
From God, I'm Large, [see] we living legends
