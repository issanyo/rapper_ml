[Verse 1: Large Professor]
Now, I've been holdin' classes on the creation of slick passages
So, instead of you bitin', why don't you ask and just wait?
Don't ever get impatient and wanna sink your teeth
Into somethin' mouth-waterin', cause you're just orderin' me
To kick some foot to that anus
Don't try to get famous, homeboy, cause my name is
The Large Professor, you got a problem? I've got the remedy
I'll tell you how to break loose, so you'll remember me
Tellin' you once, you can't slip up, dunce
You hear me recite clearly because I lost my gold fronts
So, to make an excuse, here's your next alternative
If you didn't listen, you better learn [?]
[?] life, to my name is a [?]
My rhymes shoot like a missile or rifle
I don't play, so think!

[Verse 2]
Now, I hear a lot of garbage on the radio today
Cause people take a sample from a record, loop it and say
Absolutely nothin', MC's sound crispy
Breakable, and if they try to diss me, they're history
Or they'll get broke upon, and as long as I'm the slicker
DJ's can enter and exit even quicker
My man, the Mad Scientist, G-O-D
Here's to cuttin' D-E-B-T, period
Along with Sir Scratch and K-Cut, rough like velcro slippers
And they cut like the rebel clippers
So, like I said before, don't try to get famous
Lookin' and buildin' a rep
You better step before you wind up nameless
Because your minuscule brain won't allow you to sound bright
So get your ass in my class, so I can show you how to write
But to produce and stupefy, the others with super fly passages
Like the Professor, you jacks should just think!

[Verse 3]
I know a couple of brothers that are true poets
But since their chance to advance is held up, you wouldn't know it
So, Neek The Exotic, raise your hand and let 'em know
That with or without a record, you're still wreckin' the show
[?], [?], [?], [?], and many more get elegant
And that's not irrelevant
Cause these same people might take a spot from you not thinkin'
Comin' up weak, and takin' things for granted, man, it
Vexes me, brothers gettin' paid, for actin' like imbeciles
Puttin' on a show to make bills
But like my saying goes:
"While you're gettin' paid and livin' luxurious
There's another that's brighter and curious"
Well, ghost for now, and when I look up, pose
Cause when you're lookin' up, you'll be smellin' rocked, poor soles
Think!
