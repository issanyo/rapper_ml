[Intro: Meyhem Lauren]
Yeah, we straight swervin on em
Skydive graciously and what not
Yo yo yo yo

[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]
Flexing Queens style in the meanwhile
My watch got the mean dial
Flooded with rocks just like a fiend vial
Supreme child, cuddle still
Never had a struggle meal
Intelligent but my demeanor got a rugged feel
Dangerous like you starin down the barrel til the slug reveal
Dont affiliate with fake cause I'm in love with real
Uh, niggas will shoot at ya
Jackson Heights nights with the connect playing Cumbia
We gold chain niggas, cocaine niggas
Son you ain't paid you gettin soul train figures
Swervin in another region, lookin exotic
Might just see me in your bitches pelvis, movin erotic
Rockin the good Nike, bare chest, no white t
Real niggas get ahead they just like me
Draped in black leather sliced thinner than prosciuto
This bitch is actin up so I'm about to get a new ho
Lauren

[Hook: Meyhem Lauren]
Peace to crimes to I never did and places I've never been
I'm a G, I'm a plead not guilty til the end, what (not guilty)
Not guilty til the end
I'm a G, I'm a plead not guilty til the end
Peace to crimes to I never did and places I've never been
I'm a G, I'm a plead not guilty til the end, what (not guilty)
Not guilty til the end
I'm a G, I'm a plead not guilty til the end

[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
On the low shinin like a fog light (fog light)
Get money nigga, never been the rob type (rob type)
Breitling on my wrist since I'm twenty one
Became a man bought a watch and a gun
Never looked back, cooked crack, controllin a fiend
Is how I feel every day when I'm chasin my dream
Queens niggas could vouch for me, Brooklyn as well
Fuck talkin to the police put me right in the cell, (fuck it)
Shit, hopefully not though, Jesus face blessin me
Peep how the rocks blow, Picasso with rock blow, nigga I'm not yo
Average motherfucker talkin bout that he got dough
Ya'll pose no threat, I'll feel safe when we hammer less
Carhartts cuff, the foam posits look amethyst
Fuck King of New York, I wanna be King of the World
Breeze through, do my thing with your girl, I'm in her

[Hook: Meyhem Lauren]
Peace to crimes to I never did and places I've never been
I'm a G, I'm a plead not guilty til the end, what (not guilty)
Not guilty til the end
I'm a G, I'm a plead not guilty til the end
Peace to crimes to I never did and places I've never been
I'm a G, I'm a plead not guilty til the end, what (not guilty)
Not guilty til the end
I'm a G, I'm a plead not guilty til the end
