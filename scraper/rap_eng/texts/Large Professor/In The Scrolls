In The Scrolls

[Verse 1 - Large Professor]
For 1994, a new chapter was added
The rap world became reborn through Illmatic
Sun, moon, and stars align and our minds
Were taken for one hell of a wild ride
Queensbridge, where stars are born
On the map Marley Marl put me on
I was able to return the favor for his neighbor
Chronicles of bullets caught up in chambers
Blessed chicks, fresh kicks, new cars
Now being re-manifested through Nas
40-side poet supreme, like water flowing through a ravine
The chosen one who will redeem
The Q-borough, the D's in the blue Camaro
Through the railroad tracks these tunes burrow
New paths for the dudes on the aves
Salute that man anytime you move past

[Hook] x4
Nobody does it better than Nas

[Verse 2 - G-Wiz]
Akinyele at the door
Like "Come on nigga, what you waiting for"
I got a meeting, said I'm Clark Kent and Warner Brothers
Straight out of Q-B, in train seven train
On the other side of the lane my nigga could reign
Extra P holding the heat out in Colden
Then my nigga Nas spit the pain the world noticed
But still shit was trill though
On the train spitting the turkey and cheese Hiro, my nigga Bo
But you, y'all never heard Gwen and Phil
The best rap I've ever heard Nas say for real
Although he lost it on the train before he got a deal
If any rapper heard it today, yo, had to kneel
It's like that, my nigga kept y'all niggas on your toes
Hooks, styles and flows, and killer shows
Then it was the birth of money, hoes, and clothes
It's Illmatic, it was written in the scrolls

[Hook] x4
