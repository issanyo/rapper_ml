[Verse 1]
Uptown with the Harlem crew, live at the barbecue
Decked out like an army troop
Camouflage, gosh, I just got the car hand-washed
The million-man march that goes by the name of William and Large
Professor, the Best Of
Isley Brothers banging out the system
Whatever yo, it was inevitable
Seen it clear something like a year ago
Prophetic, Prof-etic
Real official and authentic
Some words that describe
It's a new day, just dropped my girl at a job
Now I'm off to the office
Jetting on the highway to add on to the opulence

[Verse 2]
Straight chilling, I stay tilling
The crops, I'm a job-bound graduate driving down Sedgewick
Avenue, b-boys salute the admiral
Prince Infinite Love Allah was the attribute
Many moons ago
I realized that life's not a Broadway musical
The rules and code
Of the streets is what I went by since the group home
Wore two-tone jeans and Lees and DVDs
Even shop with EBTs
Can't tell me about the struggle
Pin that ass to the grass and jump off the turnbuckle
God told me my luck'll change once I free the cage
And start thinking long-range
Ever since then I commence
Battle on mad strong and add on to the opulence
