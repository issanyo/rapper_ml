[Intro:]
Yeah [x3]
Uh huh

[Verse 1:]
You were smiling
You even had your hands in the air
I declare even heard you shout ah yeah
Mad open like earlier in the day you even had oatmeal
So energetic fuel was injected in your artery
Soul train dancer honoree
What it looked like then you took flight all of a sudden
But you was just balling or something
Then you did the Flintstone car pulling for something
Out of nowhere
There was a girl on the floor giving you a blank stare
Couldn’t figure out what the hell was happening
But you was holding slim Soph by the abdomen
The way you scurried off looked bad my friend
That must’ve been your girl it had to have been and she

[Chorus:]
Seen you on the floor dancing with Sophia yo
Seen you on the floor dancing with Sophia
Seen you on the floor dancing with Sophia yo
Seen you on the floor dancing with Sophia

[Verse 2:]
It’s only dancing but you was on the floor romancing
Spitting in the air and was getting no answer
Tapping doing the chant like you was fat man scoop
So to tell you the truth
Sophia is a fine specimen that I’ve had the honor to know
Since the days of a child
She don’t intertwine with no ordinary vibe
Even though you kick lyrics nice try
There’s nothing wrong with being friendly and jovial
The storm will go off and it’ll be overdue
Don’t try to get attached cuz you might get snatched
By the collar by a 40 degree black belt scholar

[Chorus:] [x2]

[Outro:]
Now that’s what’s happening
