Classic
New York City Borough of Queens sh—
Cormega
Tradgedy Khadafi
Large Professor
And this one here is named
Focused up
Twist a cap and roll it up

(Hook)
(We focused up)
With our eyes on the package kid
(We fuck with drugs)
With them knives and them ratchets yeah
(We open it up)
Right behind bout to smash it in
(You know what’s up)
With them guys with the platinum Benzes

(Cormega)
I’m independent, yet I hold major weight
And I go in like Denzel on Training Day
That’s how I play the game, Kobe with the fadeaway
Black mamba, the Lama will blow your whole face away
Thirsty ass niggas need Haterade
Sitting on the bench is for bums, watch a player play
I overcame drama like Mary J
Struggled with each tear, I won’t make the same mistakes
I been gone awhile, no more takin' breaks
My name on the highest scale, I hold crazy weight
This is food for thought on your mental plate
Nothing in life is free, so I make 'em pay
No credit, Large Pro, Tradg, and Mega
Bars so poetic, y’all won’t forget 'em
If rhyme is a crime, my mic’s my codefendant
Thus I stand tall and won’t fall under pressure

(Hook) x2

(Tradgedy Khadafi)
Yo I’m illll
High sciences, lines is holy grail
Touchin' every hood nigga like a direct sale
All hail allah, this mic lord
Militant G shit
I spill my life upon the mic cord
Exotic street shit
Bicoastal when I flow though
Khadafi ride harder than that Ralph Lauren logo
Impeccable live soloist
Lift the dead out of they grave
Black market billionaire, self-made
Boss status, we the origins to the zone
Yeah me, Mega, and P, the real watchin' the throne
Yo my MOs was armed robberies
Since a juvenile I switched lanes
Still the streets’ll always be a part of me
Part of me, back to the aura that flow retardedly
Swagga off the chain the streets in my arteries
Queens, style so aces
And I do this for arabic scarfaces conspiracy murder cases

(Hook) x2

(LP)
Hunned percent
I come gunning through the vent
While they slumber
The wake up call, rounds’ll thunder
Right under, they nostrils
Put patients in hospitals
We the heat, they as frigid as popsicles
Leap over obstacles in a single bound
With batman captions like bang boom pow
Blank top rank, yeah breaking news file
Tall smorgasbord, stroll thru on a horse-drawn
Carriage, a hip hop Blake Carrington
Dynasty consists of the finest MC
With no finder’s fee
My mystique shall remain mystic
Fake world misfit, bake mountains of bisquick
On mics, lights, yeah you know the rest
Mega philosophy
Tradg is the hard
Large Pro the best
And we throw the vest
Over the hip hop careers thru the years
And are we still focused yet?

(Hook) x2
