[Verse]
I know niggas that do crime on usbs
I know niggas that do crime for them USDs
United States Dollars, but you ain't united with me
Like a match to the gas, you ignited the heat
My butane burn you niggas like weed
You all seeds
Like torrents on the internet
Could end you in a millisec
And all while cashing checks
Cash me outside
Catch me in a ride with your bitch
With no license cuz I got no sense
Giving your mind dents and I'm leaving your spine bent
Thats your only option
Savagery, I'll tell a nigga that his mom thick
Send out pictures of the bitch with her hand on my dick
And she stroking my stick
She got my hot dog in her wet wet
I guess I frank oceaned her shit
My flows as hydro as an ocean can get
I'll leave your migos deads cause I'm so offset
I'll leave your niggas with no head I'm so upset
On how these niggas do hip hop I'm so nauseous
On how often they do mumble rap, I'm ending all that mumble crap
This shit hit you right in your mouth, now you can mumble rap
Acidic and spicy, I'm asking you can you stomach that
I can teach you what feds can, you should shut your trap
My raps got more weight than your own, can you run with that
This young nigga stealing your plate, are you done with that
Dont frown, because I spit profound
Banana clip spitter, I can go mad rounds
Wait till my album come out so you can peep background
They try to shut me down, and lock me down, I spit too wild
I spit cavities into existence
A dope flow that'll leave em tripping
Bloody murder with this hip hop I'll live em dripping
I could spit 33 bars i'm so scottie pippen
Mummified niggas, wonder why his bodies stiffined
I see fear in your shaking bones with x-ray vision
You can catch this verbal headshot from any distance
Deadshot, Suicide Squad, put Will Smith in
Turn ya posse into zombies, they still limpin
Yall some babies in this rap game
Yall still kickin
Number 2 on these dudes, I'm still shitting
These bars elite they build a whole fucking prison
I got a fuck you for the whole system
I'm so different, where Two Chains at
I went out in the concrete jungle
Brought two manes back
I partake in reckless expenditures
And leaving you dismembered
Step to me, your autopsy will say
Death by misadventure
I'm a damn pave low, I'm set to make the game blow
No wonder I'm so fire, I was born inside a volcano
Kill enemies, but you not respawning like Halo
Flow sexy as fuck, it's like the booty on J-Lo
Thick rhymes, fruitful like Watermelon thick rhinds
With sick lines, I'll leave your brain crooked like a Smith Grind
It's my ball, you niggas dont get time
