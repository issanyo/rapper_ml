Spacey

[Verse 1]
I got the justice for [?]
Letting off into the atmosphere, bring it for fear
To a spacey generation two thousand for you
Large Professor from the galaxy where niggas stay true to the black
But never the whole cause the whole is something that you gotta stay out of
You know I got soul so listen to the [?] from Large Pro, black
Thoughts in my mind just enable me to go back and forth
To the banktellers greet me with a smile cause they love [?] intergalactic style
And I can get spacey

[Hook] x8
Spacey

[Verse 2]
The second one I'm comin' next to your planet
Now everybody [?] can't understand it
Don't panic I'm spreading like an epidemic
[?]
