[Chorus: Nas sample]
"I, I excel.."
"I, I excel, then prevail"
"I, I excel.."
"I, I excel, then prevail"
"I, I excel.."
"I, I excel, then prevail"
"I, I excel.."
"I, I excel, then prevail"

[Intro over Chorus]
Word up, word up
It's that murder, that melodic motivational music
Huh, huh...
Made for them different niggas that do the impossible
Get your weight up
I don't even know how to start this

[Verse 1]
Criminology, rap pornography
Black mahogany, literally'll knock back your lobotomy
The wack acknowledge me, knowledge seed, no minor league
Medina repper, street assessor I'm signing to me
Macadocious, morning time mimosas
Porcupine on the loafers, I spit the rhyme for the culture
No consultor, clever, never a poster
Toast to whatever, the wetter the better the chocha
Sosa, senior, dictator demeanor
A scorer in the player arena, got my lawyer to wave a subpoena
Let the Mahalia linger
I prevail, rock a nigga jail bail on my finger
From Argentina to the Heights in Brooklyn, my life's cushion
So nice without the ice could bag your wife woofing
Why wouldn't? Its bigger than the money and stunting
See a lot of y'all ain't learn nothing
Where the real at?

[Chorus: Nas sample]
"I, I excel.."
"I, I excel, then prevail"
"I, I excel.."
"I, I excel, then prevail"
"I, I excel.."
"I, I excel, then prevail"
"I, I excel.."
"I, I excel, then prevail"

[Verse 2]
Perignon pourer
Very calm aura
Rollie arm looks so phenom under water
So I'm far from the floorver, spawn with a quarter
Spanish blonde, at the River Palm 'bout to order
Maturer, came from the kid off the corner
How I lived ain't no telling what I did in my former
I warn ya, impeach though ready for war
The most adored with a deadly rapport from the core
Dutch blower, no (?) linen shit
You could look but won't find a limbo on my sentiments
To y'all trash, lost tribe of Shabazz
Half ass spitting gram rap niggas is sad, could have spazzed
On so many different occasions
No relation with car thefts or home invasions
My occupation is get low, money and hoes, switch clothes
Mind mines and stick to the code...
