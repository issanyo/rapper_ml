[Intro]
Come on, y'all, get live, get down
Common Sense is in your town
I said, come on, y'all, get live, get down
Common Sense, ya know...

[Verse 1]
I stagger in the gathering possessed by a patter-in
That be scatterin'
Over the global my vocals be travellin'
Unravellin' my abdomen it's slime that's babblin'
Grammatics that are masculine
I grab them in, verbally badgerin broads
I wish that Madelyne was back on Video LP
Raps I make up like blacks do excuses
I feel like Noah, hookin' my mellows up on deuces
If a broad ain't got a mind or job or crib she useless
Acoustic basslines embrace rhymes while I chase mines
They say signs of the end is near
I wonder can I walk a righteous path holdin' a beer
Got more verses than a Kramer, go off like a pager
Skills uglier than Craig Mack — in your ear, I'm the flavor
My old bird said some of my songs sound like noise
Don't watch the Bulls as much, they got too many (white) boys
A million black men walkin' towards one direction
For sure, the cream of the planets—resurrection

[Scratched Hook]
"Resurrection"

[Verse 2]
A prophet, raised among Black Disciples and Vice Lords
Who don't give a (fuck) about mic cords
At night, swords get up — together, black wrists get cuffed
I'm wishin' for a change but my man want his change in a cup
Yessir, I'm in the Mix-a-Lot
(Bitches) put 'em on the glass while I'm puttin' stickers on they (ass)
I rule everything around me like cash
On the rocks of reality, dreams get splashed
In jams I M*A*S*H like Alan Alda
(Niggas) nod, thangs say 'hey' as if I was Little Walter
87 strip walker, taught the code of the area
By staying, within the barrier
Exposed to Stony stimuli, with that I identify
Brothers went through my rotate solidify the realness
Skull-cap smurf, Puffy jacket, Lugz boots on
Steppin' to me is like goin' to the County being a Neutron

[Scratched Hook]
"Resurrection"

[Verse 3]
I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike
When in dim light, I use insight to enlight
Then write something that's skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe
Imagination's in flight
I send light, like Ben's kite I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights
And in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like
I spend nights up in dykes
I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
(That's right) I got it made
I bathe in basslines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the, malt liquor
Off the malt liquor I fought niggas
Now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruise the Southside streets, no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
87 got my back and we don't get no thicker
Extra P got my back and that's my (nigga)
Now I'm a ho but not a ho (nigga)
Ain't scared of no (nigga)
When it's my turn to go I gotta go
And I'm gone with the storm

[Scratched Hook]
