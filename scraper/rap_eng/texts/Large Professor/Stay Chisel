Stay chisel like a box of wife beater by Fila
Lou Ferrigno, Arnold Schwarzenegger type steelo
Stay chisel, check your paper nigga
Bring the bar to your chest, then push it up harder than the rest
Stay chisel, precisely cut, sharp the fuck
You thought this was a game we came to charge you up
So take it to the brain, laid peoples, know how throw them things
Swift on them toes, knockout blows, so stay chisel

[Large Professor]
Ey yo Nas, I was telling them niggas on the ave
The same shit the other day (right)
Kids gotta stay sharp (no doubt) or stay chisel (chisel)

[Nas]
Yo, perform, a chest naked, I'm looking sharp for the peoples
Not in my physical form, strong thoughts, I'm cock-diesel
Brolic with knowledge so flow with me
Intelligence benching, 4004-50, light a dumbbell L
Inhale then hear the lunch bell rings, sweating
Working up her appetite, setting
Mental-calistetics got my mind stretching, then I release it
Have my whole frame bulging under diamond pieces
Take the weight of the world on my shoulders, I hold it
So I consume most the pain for my niggas I roll wit
Cause see, the streets ain't no Gold's Gym, papi
And if I feel it going down then my niggas'll spot me
Without the mind, the bodyweight don't even mean nothing
Let's take 3 brothers and put them in the bing or something
Who's gonna survive? The wise man, the fool or the warrior
Well if all of their minds are chisel, then all of them

I stay chiseled, like Snoop Dogg, fo' shizzle my nizzle
In them hardcore streets I'm a straight official
Six pack, don motivator, throwing the weight up
Kid tried to front so I showed him straight up
Had his whole click flabbergasted
Way I was cutting 'em up, one kid yelled out "Grab the bastard"
Tried to rush me, luckily I wasn't rusty
Pulled out, served 'em all up like a custy
Couldn't go out, highway with a blow out
Like Frank, I did it my way, nigga, no doubt
Large billionaire and I'm still here
Writing rhymes for the sphere, I do not feel fear
You heard, I'm the dude on the porch with the herb
And I tell you right now, kid, soft is a word
That don't describe me, what y'all know that's this lively
Barbecue 2, Nas right here beside me (with Akinyele)
