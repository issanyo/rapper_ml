[Intro: Pete Rock]
Yeah, uhh uhh InI is in the place
Yeahyeah uuh
Along with my man Extra P and my man Q-T
Here in the place to be
With the capital P, Rock on

[Verse 1: Grap Luva]
Vibrations from my voice bring life to microphones
If I make wrong moves then I'm headed for the dead zone
You heads flown and it's a crazy mess
You should've fessed when it came time to test the best
So next up is the one, the non-half stepper
The keeper of the door, healer of the lepers
Controller of the greed seed, with no ego to feed
Cause I stays level headed, vocabulary
Embedded up in the dome
I'm bound to crush Rome and let my spirit roam free
See it's the G bring it to you in the physical
Comin' through with the crucial raw material
I entertain each time I'm in the session
Leavin' brothers guessin', yo, what's that sound?
Got 'em wishin' they was on this pitcher's mound throwin' down
InI vibrations over plump tracks
Most of y'all clown cats couldn't match that
Touch this, I don't think you should attempt to
Cause if you do, of course I got to exempt you
From gettin any clout
No doubt, to each his own

[Hook]
To each his own (repeat 8 times)

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Check it out to each his own, watch out cat
Niggas fake jacks to get a dollar bill
The choices made, they choose to ill
In Sodom and Gomorrah, survival is a horror
Scrams, let's make a move, you tryin' to be top scorer
And he really don't give a rat's ass who he go through
He's a big boy, he bites all he can chew
But yo, I eat on plates with hip-hop written on it
Pete Rock, the group InI shittin' on it
Lyrically impressive, ain't no second guesses
The most poppin' shit talker is the one who stresses
And you see the Abstract with a tight lipped carry
Speakin' on my peace and my soul is never varied
To my microphone I dialogue
It answers back with a whole lot a love, complemented with claps
I'm on some Grown Man shit, my peak is not yet reached
So, I remind my own and think of each
To each his own

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rob-O]
Excuse me, I'm here to earn a mere a buck or two
Now, take a chance with life or loser fuckin' you
All your friends, you're fly but why pretend?
You used to be shy but now you want be my skins
On the D-L, this is gonna swell for a second
But if I'm catchin' wreck
How many others is she steppin' in the sack with?
Guess I better get a prophylactic
Back to the crib in case I smack it
Bad tactic 'cause a jim hat caught a flat
Plus the boots, they wasn't even all of that
Now it's hectic, I'm jettin' to the joint to get injected
Bust it, the fact that I'm infected, so, check it out, yo
When you with these chicks and they spread out
With skins enough to take ya head out
Use precaution 'cause hookers packin' death behind a zit
Peace to the Gods and watch your dick
To each his own

[Verse 4: Large Professor]
To each his own, niggas is sown by the full-blown
Brother who could never be a clone
Large Pro, so fuck your bullshit hard show
I'm reppin' with the weapon, my whole squad glow
Like a diamond, so don't sham, fam, I have to climb in
That ass like a truck, leavin' niggas just struck
Like a lightnin' bolt, the cash flow goes right in the vault
In the end, peace to len times ten
Cee-Lo, the whole InI is my people
So, sit back relax and just listen while we pull
The moneys and honeys, fake frauds get thrown
To each his own, to each his own

[Hook](repeated til fade)
