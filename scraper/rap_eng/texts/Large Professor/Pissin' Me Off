[Hook x2]
You pissing me off!
You making me mad!
You faking the funk!
You faking bad!
You pissing me off! (x4)

[Verse 1]
Well if it isn't Mr. "Me Too"
Said he had a flow like a ski dude
Those doo doo ass rhymes
You were kicking back in pre-school
Fake MCs, I can't get down with, look see through
They rap about their wardrobe look like the prequel
I'm lethal, with pencils, and anything that you speak to
You better be keeping it real, when you speak to
A G like me, if she likes me, it's off with their clothing
'For you know it, you'll be tweeting me saying "It's nice to meet you"
I be cool, they crack when the pressure get applied
Roll the L, I got to put the essence in the sky
The defendant has arrived, he's in question for his lies
On the mic, I be kicking like a blessing in disguise
You have met with your demise, what it be like?!
Getting brothas off with that Bruce Lee high
You jacked my see light, it be like that sometimes
I can't control but its damn sho' for real
Never bogus when I flow it, never 'voke it
Don't know how you niggas made it
Everything you created was that fake shit
They hardly played it, stay kicking that fail shit fragrant
I don't play with kids, I'm a grown as man you on some baby shit
Everyday we get in the studio and make a hit
Swear I got the skill to make a Christian turn atheist
Couldn't handle it, couldn't take it
They see me and they start shaking
Man quit with all that damn faking!

[Hook]

(Man here come this bitch ass nigga man)

[Verse 2]
Ah fuck man, its you again
I don't fuck with them, I only get down with hooligans
Extra moody yo ass clowns, whistling booty holes
Niggas got fucked by they label, smooth roll
Who flows the dope, and won't ever lose control
You in the slow lane, I be on cruise control
Don't abuse the mic, spit the coolest flows
Hands in the sky, just let the music go
All my raps speak for me, you let somebody tweet for you
And you never been in the streets homie, I'm yawning
Cause yo whole little speech boring
You make it rain in the club but your beats foggy, no money
I never seen such a weak crony
Yes men got you fooled you ain't even knowing
How bad you flow is, God damn your bogus
While I'm so explosive and still on that west coast shit

[Hook]
