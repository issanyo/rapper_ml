As soon as I light this, skies I might kiss
A lot of evil out here, I'm trying to be righteous
And lord knows everyone has vices
I'm just hoping mine doesn't leave me lifeless
So I drive like I lost my license
Slow 'til the po' go and turn at the lights and
Right when I see it, gassing the straight away
I'm gone in a second watch the kid fade away

Mo' money, mo' problems
Feel like I always gotta solve 'em
Sometimes I just wanna kill time
Sometimes I wanna aim and revolve 'em
Keys on the table with the wallet
Grab and go, putting numbers on my mileage
I just really want you to know one thing
Yo, the game's really finna get demolished

Ay, my master plan is be the last to win
S'why I gotta secure, ensure cash is in
Need a woman that's motherly and passionate
To take care of my seeds when the madness hits cause
Nowadays everybody'll talk slick
Anything spoken sound like it's an auction
And I don't buy it, nope, not even often
Yo, it must be reality that I be lost in
I can't relate in this new day and age
Where I'd rather think rational for both of our sakes
They tried to murk me bet I rose from the grave
If you want to get sick watch what I gross from the game
I'm finna ball cause the balls in the don's court
Catch me with an L if I'm ever on the golf course
Need to sail to the bank, it be off shore
And back to the crib where my bird's be on all fours
