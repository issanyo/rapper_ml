[Verse One: Large Professor]:
On the mic at this time is the high exulted
Guy who altered the rap game with high voltage
Beats and lyrics, we run shit with no clearance
You'll get played like Focker from Meet The Parents
We get paid like rock stars, two seat Mclarens
Rollin' up Jamaican Ave kid, when people hear they go bonkers
Why? Cause it's the number one song cuz
Playin' on your radio, generatin' more buzz
Turnin' down offers
For that wack mummy rap, I'll blap and take a flight into the store cause
He rep the streets, for years and weeks
Decades and days, from phase to phase
I stand strong on 'em
Right over left you can't strong arm 'em
I grab the knife and the chef and with nah problem
What so ever, no matter what's the weather
Just sit back relax as JS cuts so clever

[Scratch Hook]:
"Like this"
"Somethin' like this"
JS-1 with the hardcore style
"Rough shit man, you know how we do" - Hurricane G 'Tonight's Da Night"
"Somethin' like this"
"I'mma show you what a DJ and a rapper should be" -7L & Esoteric 'Another Way Out'
Large Professor with the hardcore style
"Rough shit man, you know how we do"
"Somethin' like this"

[Verse Two: Large Professor]:
A real DJ
Not a clown on an instant replay
JS-1 cut up battle sounds and beat breaks
Live, no retakes, but some try to retrace the pattern
Get rubbed like the lamp of Aladdin
Grant your wishes
Two heads are vicious
When it come to that vinyl and wax
Kid, your man's malicious
Ammunition's no prob when JS on the job
He Rock Steady
With ? chops like a machete
Put the tune on
Hookin' up the antiscape
Another king from the Queens land mass, mind state
That's thorough
When it come to a scratch, he got several
The homies in the hood dig the rap like a shovel
All day
Along with the cuts that saute the hook
Brought to you by a knight and a rook
Sewn together
By doin' a rough show en devour
So sit back relax as JS cuts so clever
