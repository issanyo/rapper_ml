[Hook]
Long and winding road

[Verse 1: First Division]
Ayo, The road is so long plus winding, something like the letter S
Several lefts and rights, it’s ugly like a sweater vest
I'm on a quest for number one that's why I never rest
No second best, I'm coming up as high as Everest
I write to get respect while others write to get a check, son
My mic's my weapon in this culture I'mma wet til death do us part
Through this art I found a way to express
The rage and excess, the weights on my chest
From all the frustration, the stress
The blood, sweat, and tears accumulated over my twenty-plus spent years
On the grind working hard to find my way to success
Of the mind word is born, no time for laying depressed
But every day that I awake and I'm blessed I shall improve
While I say that I'm the greatest and best to hold the tool
By the way special guest he bless us be from Marco
It's the Large Professor, Extra P, the Large Pro

[Verse 2: Large Professor]
It's the long, winding road, cause what we been told
Keep your dreams on your goal while rustling dough
Look back, sync the new pad and the bookbag
Fully stacked, in fact make a hoodie your hat
Make whips your kicks
What you wearing? Bottom line: Beanie's jacked
They busting, tell 'em ease back
And jump off mine, I got a player more fine
Got back on track now the greatest of all time is here
Sorry I had to disappear
But you know how it goes when you walking that long, winding road
People you walk with might quit
Ain't too many dudes really built for the night shift
When things get dark
Got to roll up your sleeves, not fall off the swings in the park
Like a kid again. Problem: I get it in
Until the team come home with a win
As I begin the next chapter
Narrowing down, the X-Factor
My ode dedicated to the long, winding road

[Samples]
The road I'm on is kind of narrow
Eyes on the road, caution on curves
Careful!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: First Division]
We lock it down with persistence, yo, y'all won't be fading our style
The kinda shit you never heard that ain't been made in a while
Always going the extra distance can't be [?]
Probably be some millionaires if we was paid by the mile
But in actual capacity pound sacks with veracity
When life throws you curves you bounce back with tenacity
Just like the arch is getting stepped on sucker
We mash the pedal, pound the pavement like we kept on trucking
On this highway to courage many have fell
To [?] turn our depths of misery, a personal hell
Seen some plenty come and go, thoughts of best the fear of foolery
Walking the same stretch since the yesteryears of puberty
Never meant to get guts spilled cattle [?]
Forgot the soul through this uphill battle for toe
To all these bitches way too bold for their britches
Break the strong, buy the gold, we bust a load on your stitches

[Verse 4: Large Professor]
When G Rap had pointed me to the road to the riches
That shit just made me want to go on adventure
For that hidden treasure, only concern was on getting better
Thought it was simple like knitting a sweater
But if you long winding, all the more you go on finding
Out the key to a straight path a strong mind and spirit
Grab hold of your heart and gear it
Towards good, baseballs and Boys in the Hood
Rap world was in High School high
Golf lessons bestowed on the guy from that God in the sky
Now I rock with Marco down the block from the sty
Years later still on and looking for the next wind in the road
And it's a good thing I'm in the mood
Got a make life longer and plus bring in a load
Of that crisp green currency, never in a hurry see
I know this game is a long winding road
