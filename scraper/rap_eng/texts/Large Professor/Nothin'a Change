What a gwaan professor
We must get over - we mass get over
Fi the ghetto youth
I know it

Nothing a change
Everything remain the Same
'Cuz the ghetto youths dem still a suffer
No food fi days
Instead a life get easy it only get tougher and tougher
Mama bawl out and she call out - call out pon jah
Say she pray every day fi the pain go away
All now she can't get better

Rifle sound- mama tear shed
When she look pon the ground she see peer red
And when she turn around - her son lay dead
Brain shell out in a him body a just peer lead
Nuff things happen through circumstances
While the System designed to hurt your chances
The way of your nine just get you hunted
Hunted - you nuh wanted
Just the under priviliged a get disadvantage
You feel to yourself you're under bondage
When those who you know nuh speak your language
Language - nuh speak your language
All we want is just freedom
When we a go see the day deh
Me and me people dem still a pray
Cause all we see a false promises
Now Mr. Babylon want take all mi hollow premises

Nothing a change
Everything remain the Same
'Cuz the ghetto youths dem still a suffer
No food fi days
Instead a life get easy it only get tougher and tougher
Mama bawl out and she call out - call out pon jah
Say she pray every day fi the pain go away
All now she can't get better

Right now mama hungry - and na food can find
Ina me gun me load two carbon
Now me have to touch the street - food have to eat
Mama - you just a one of a kind
So many want to get away - from this way of life
When all dem See around is just guns and knife
A better way - far from pain and strive
Fighting so hard to survive

Nothing a change
Everything remain the Same
'Cuz the ghetto youths dem still a suffer
No food fi days
Instead a life get easy it only get tougher and tougher
Mama bawl out and she call out - call out pon jah
Say she pray every day fi the pain go away
All now she can't get better

If you pick up your nine it goodly end your shine
Now you find out you living a life of pure crime
You don't want to but have to pon the frontline
Frontline - again at the frontline
And the mountain over deh so so hard to climb
Looking for solutions we search to find
Be sharp in this time smart in this time
Find a way to unleash your gold mine
Freedom - that's all in me
Freedom - that's all in me
Now free up all a the ghetto youth dem
We want freedom - that's all in me
Gentleman and professor
I need jah
