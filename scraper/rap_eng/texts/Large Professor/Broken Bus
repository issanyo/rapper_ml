[Verse 1: Jaysonic, Comel 15, JahPan, Romen Rok, and InfoMite]
[Jaysonic]
Yo, star, I got you open like a crowbar
It’s broken bus, but life’s so good so far
My twelve inches got a double meaning.  Vinyl
Heads know what I’m saying, plus my ex-girls are intervening
[Comel 15]
Cats are fiending, so let’s give ‘em a hit
[JahPan]
But them kitty meow meows, they’re on some kibble and bits
And your boys don’t make noise.  Them dogs is hushpuppies
[Comel 15]
Plus I heard it’s five ohms for a little sucky sucky
[JahPan]
Long time love me in the back of the van.  Now we’ll
Be man, crack your fam with the clap of my hands
[Romen Rok]
Well, it’s the Dapper Dan, changed-theme, look-alike rapping man
Shepherd up a classic jam, so oil up the frying pan
[Comel 15]
And call the fireman.  It’s getting hot in here
[JahPan]
And, girl, back that ass up.  You got a lobster rear
[Romen Rok]
With a rack to match
[JahPan]
Yeah, and that’s a fact
[Romen Rok]
I bet you’ll hit the whole crew, baby, back-to-back
[Jaysonic]
And we could do that there.  Just bring the raincoats
The verse we disperse full of insane quotes
[Romen Rok]
Yeah, no-holds-barred spit-slapping, skill-slipping
Do with four flat tires—broken bus still whipping
[InfoMite]
(And we got) pots and pans
[Comel 15]
(We got) plots and plans
And one of these days, we’re gonna have lots of land
[JahPan]
And you thought you was the Sun, but you’re not JahPan
[InfoMite]
Mekalek, Dusty Frazier, time to rock the jam

[Hook: Samples with Scratches by DJ Mekalek and Dusty Frazier]
"You wasn't down when we was riding the bus" - Sample from Edo. G on Ed O.G. & Da Bulldogs - "I Got to Have It" (x3)
“So put on your Adidas and step off" - Sample from Edo. G on Ed O.G. & Da Bulldogs - "I Got to Have It"

[Verse 2: Jaysonic, JahPan, Comel 15, Romen Rok, and InfoMite]
[Jaysonic]
From Seattle to Miami, San Diego to Maine
The appeal of Jaysonic isn’t hard to explain
[JahPan]
And from Chicago to Motown and back to the pro
Ayyo, JahPan needs a Dutch, so let’s stop at the stove
[Comel 15]
And they call me “Chomel” down in Mexico
But they call me 15 in San Francisco
[Romen Rok]
[?] Santiago is my eponym, yo, when I’ll
Be stepping in dough from Edgewood to Acapulco
[InfoMite]
If Mitey is your lady’s choice.  From Long
Beach to South Beach, they all know my voice
[JahPan]
We’re burning ganja in Ghana, scama in Bahamas
Hash in Morocco, Turkey, Botswana
[Jaysonic]
Yeah, you couldn’t hold a candle to this.  Your style’s
Dry like ginger ale from Canada is
[Comel 15]
No, we’re not finished and we’re not finished
I’m always holding something green and it’s not spinach
[Romen Rok]
Ayyo, I’ll spend my free time bullying an emcee
Got him in the corner, weeping like a willow tree
[InfoMite]
And when I get an extra set, guess what I’m gonna do?
Roll up in your favorite spot and chill harder than you
[Jaysonic]
So the moral of the story?
[Romen Rok]
Broken buses getting fixed
[Comel 15]
Here’s a worldwide alert
[InfoMite]
And everybody’s at risk
