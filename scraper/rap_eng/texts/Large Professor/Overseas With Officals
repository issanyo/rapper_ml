[Intro: Large Proffesor]
Ey yo, live and direct, Tommy Tee presents
Neek The Exotic, Large Pro, yo here we go

[Verse 1: Large Proffesor]
I be the molotov most high
Exalted nigga who faulted
Straight from the streets of new york kid
Nine block radius rap for you cranius off the head
Spontanous now I'm famous, sneakers fresh
Nuthin too complex some done shit
When I'm on this track I'm sponsored
By Tommy Tee, Tee Double
The illeg' level that we on be guaranteed trouble
For these wack niggas rap niggas gets no love
Have 'em looking like faggots in the disco club
I just collect cabbage and just go grub
At the end of the day we don't dwindle away we stay strong
Secret agent like James Bond I am on the next flight to Miam'
I stay traveling through all the snakes unraveling
Playing my part stay sharp like a javelin
Banging on a boulevard airing on the avening in the parks
I leave mics rift aparts in little pieces
Looking for me I'm where them beats is bro
Internationally known as da supreme grand imperial
Large Proffesor spit 816 bars of fressure
In the flesh all a nigga won is cars with treasure
In the spirit your niggas ain't trying to hear it
Well let me lyric some words from the top of the nugget
Cause no matter what kid we going keep on rocking
With Neek The Exotic

Oslo, Overseas With Officals

Live and direct son (repeats until Verse 2)

Yeah, Neek The Exotic, Large Pro

[Verse 2: Neek The Exotic]
Yo, yo, yo I put it down now banging like surround sound
I'm from the Queens narrow homies don't fuck around
I blast tracks down like like he's next style
Rock Crocodile but only if it's Mory Pal
Straight from Norway to N.Y. City, where niggas get busy
Tommy Tee tracks make you dizzy
Straight blasting raps that's everlasting
Great niggas ass up then put 'em in a caston
Keep shit stepping us Queen nigga be repping
My album done drop time to learn the lesson
Been a long time coming but a nigga is here son
Now it's time to blast off the game is mad soft
Neek & Large Pro is coming like the red coast
Blazing shit up from coast to coast
Ain't a damn thing changed straight lyrics from the brain
Sorta like cane but it's stronger than that
And I'm all across the globe for the shit I rap
Keep repping and if niggas is wack keep stepping
Playing no games there's no time for that
Just kicking raw raps cause it's like that
