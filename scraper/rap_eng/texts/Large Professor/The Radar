[Verse 1]
Out on the street roams William X-P poems
Describer of heat bones that put motherfuckers in deep zones
It’s classic, full biz Shaggy Boombastic
Flagship nigga with the shiny new classic
That outlasted most, host of the century
Chopping off domes like a big bowl of chimichurri
You’re now on a new adventure with P
Where I write and recite words intricately
Through the shuffle, the hustle and bustle I unruffle
Dudes’ feathers, seeking out new endeavors
I rain from riding on the outside lane
All day on ‘em, even down South my name
Ring bells — on the head, on the reg
Pretty girls wanna pay, straight thunder
I stay stuntin’, number stay under
The radar, the radar

[Verse 2]
This is Legendary P status, worldwide fame
X-Pro on the mountaintop, bird's-eye aim
On the suckas, chuckas and jivers who ain’t as live as
I is, coming in at all shapes and sizes
Pretty puffed up industry clones is getting banned
Whenever I step it’s inside the jam
Bringing realty, paving the way like the D.O.T. on ‘em
I beat ‘em, not having to join ‘em
It’s Wilhelm, always telling people how I feel, fam
Sharpening the skills and letting ‘em know
On a boulevard mission, I’m ready to go
Tip time any place, any area code
It’s that boss-like guy with the on point foresight
Hotter than Jallah but colder than the frostbite
Getting you so excited, call him the sure-shot star
Live comfortably, pa, under the radar

[Verse 3]
Please believe, kid, I tell you no floss, I go hard, it’s Pro Large
I hit ‘em with the iron no starch
Or priest, when Marco Polo doing the beats
It’s wildfire flavor, hang on to your seats
Still moving, the O.G.s and the little juvie-niles
Have ‘em straight wylin out in the als
In the stands, I speak so y’all can understand
This rapper cash in and at least a hundred
For the span, eternally feet planted firm-i-ly
L.I., B-K, Queens, state and Germany
Stance, lock clamps on ‘em all, on the mall, here today
For all y’alls who veered away from the righteous path
I’m here to school you with the staff on the ave
We handing out flicks and autographs
For the newbies, puffing doobies in the tinted-out car
I maintain under the radar
