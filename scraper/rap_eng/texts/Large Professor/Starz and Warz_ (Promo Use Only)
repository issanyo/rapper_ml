So we fight for recognition
Trying to make it on tv as religion
Radio play with the Lil Wayne's
Social terorrism
The pedestals been risen
They sold us a dream
So everyones a rapper
So anybody can get it
Millions upon millions
But whats sort of pathetic
We're struggling and struggling around a pay check
With our selves for protection
Grinding and grinding is our personal credit
With no one else to give it
Thats why with every line you gotta come sick
You're hearing a prophet with timeless lyrics
Thats bust like a tech
Amo infinite
A star whether you'd like to admit it
In the lab like a recluse and yes he handles his business
Quite as kept
Releasing this gem
Off free will and independence
Beat murderer so its on to the next
Stage to get wrecked
Blessed with the hypest, beat Mike Tyson style
Rhymers possessed




Madd ILLz
Audio enhanced we dancing
The oppressed enchanted by the enhancements
Engaged with in game attachments flashing
In flash flood fashion
We smash bugs standing
Passion
Of the Christ cancelled you can't win
You been casted as broke characters with castings
All hands in, hands on deck chanting
Hands on heart, they hate our anthems
Catchy hook, flashy look standards
Get crashed and shook
With captain hook tactics
Bashing
Hazardous activists arise from the ashes
Those willing to die, make changes for the passive
Those willing to side with villainous size getting trapped in
The whole minimal mind living inside the broke stances
What are the chances of us lasting
Beyond Death
Better laugh at it before it passes



Will Blaze
As the world turns
Currency controls it
The government manipulates and molds it
Opportunities are golden
Some prosper
Promises get broken
Cold shoulders from the culprits
Many are left hopeless
With nothing to show for it
A world filled with corruption
Nastadamus saw it
Views of the torrid, torrent
Times is creating creating terror
Controlling the MASSES
They rule with an iron fist
Appoint a special task force of scientists
Creating cures, they only know exist
Saving they're own, spying with drones
Creating clones, tapping your phones
Classified top secret scripts
Evidence of space ships
Lurking through the quasars and suns
Lazars and guns
Radars and super novas
They send expendable soldiers
Taking lands over
Protecting the borders from dusk till dawn
Flash grenades and napalm
Super ninja swarm
Collecting orbs from souls thats gone
A new regime
The revolution has SPAWNED !
