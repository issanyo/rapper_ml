[Verse 1]

On the block down Main Street
Where everything was sweet
Students went to learn in the building that changed me
From a baby boy to a fine young producer on the rise
I remember how they used to organize
In the corridors, in the staircases wild cutting
Some others was serious and some was 'bout nothing
Queens guys, we gluttons for punishment
Always in some shit
Everybody thought they was running it
Flushing, Corona, LeFrak & Jamaica
The four territories that would basically make up the student body
Chicks meandering through the lobby
With Polo Jeans and jewelry, my new hobby
Was scooping 'em, after school I was looping 'em beats
Sitting in the twelve twelve with Paul, Soup and 'em
Pulling off Superman all night sessions with G
Then in the morning go back with no sleep to-

Bowne, Bowne (Flushing to be exact)

[Verse 2]

'88, no '89, was the start of my prime
When I hit the auditorium and polished my rhyme
Was Professor Paul Juice, wasn't Large at the time
Trying to think of a line that I could launch at a dime
Kept the gear references real slick inside the verses
While others was popping shit and some sounded nervous
Me? I found my purpose
And finally, I could write a positive message
Cause teachers had their eye on me
Some tried to spy on me, over my shoulder
Remember one teacher asked what I wrote and I showed her
Read the shit out loud for the class but I was proud
Cause it all made sense and since
Yeah, I vowed to be Grand High Imperial, Large Professor
Know the one that be on the tape, bars of pressure
Then combine them little songs and do right not wrong
I owe it all to the institution now back home called-

[Verse 3]

So now the years float by on the calendar
And some of my peers, they know the guy from the ground up
Often appear, here and there and all around the
G-L-O-B, they roll out, they here the sound of the Do Double B?
In the halls and on the lunch lines, trying to impede
On the bars and the punchlines
Back in the days when I was basically unsigned
At one time
But dreams come true and now I'm
At the top of my game when I be laying it down
Walking on the same road I've been paving since Bowne
Everyday when I be making my way into town
Via Main and was ?  and I think about-
