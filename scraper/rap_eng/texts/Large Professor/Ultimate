[Large Professor]
Yo, I take your brain on a freestyle excursion
Cuttin things up, ask P I'm his surgeon
Hip hop emergency, yeah, it's kind of urgent
Rapprers getting all washed up in their detergent
But I'm still fresh and my lyrics is strong
I like Mary J girls all night long
I tale the metal back, Colt gave you the gun
Then tell Chuck Berry how I rate your song
To mess with the best reach inside your purses
Put that money on the men with live verses
Top to the bottom, bottom to top I
Make the rest look drunk like a bottle of vodka
In the alley way, bent, leaning over the stoope
Used to roll with my beats now I roll in the coupe
With the quickness, quick mix without the relic
If it's anyting good I'm about to grabb it

[Hook]
One, two, one, two
One, two y'all, one, two, one, two
One, two y'all, it's the ultimate shit
That you got to go get with the niggas legit

[Large Professor]
You listen to a hardcore legend of rap
With the doller sign rhyme and a five star track
I travel the scenes all across the world
Even Mexico bustin that Charles Suprero
And ther's no jokes, large coast to coast
Listen to grown folks, while you takin your toast
I be straight like that bent line juming out genuine
Automobile with the back seat climb
Straight captain of the south and the north
And I ride trough the streets so I care for law
Better stay on, niggas be writing with creon
I type in the laptop, quick to spray on
Like crylon, dvd made out of nylon
With the ribbon, kill them with that Larry Bird weapon
Hot now ever since when I was warm
I was telling y'all I would take the world by storm
Now it's on

[Hook]
One, two y'all, one, two, one, two
One, two y'all
It's just rhymes
