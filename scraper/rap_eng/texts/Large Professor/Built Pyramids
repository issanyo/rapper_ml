[Intro]
Large Pro
It's my first Large Pro beat
You a genius nigga
I'm honored
And with them gray's in your beard
You lookin' more like a genius

Flushing Meadow Park, drive my heights 8 store
We playing baseball, then we slangin 8 balls
Mission impossible, Alley Cat he shot niggas, got shot too
Locked at the hospital
Jamaican Ave., chicken patty with the cocoa bread
I know Jamaicans on drugs, call em cocoa heads
Since lookin at the front door, always want more
So I got drugs pump and more
This is my belief, my philosophy, geography
Ecology, biology, psychology
I used to spit Gillette razors, hand in hand with my Pakistan man
We made papers
Fish scales from Jackson Heights Colombians
I.S. 61, was raised for no republicans
And I don’t mean to get all political
But Mitt Romney don’t plan to do shit for you

[Hook]
What the theory is, Sunlight to 1 at night, we the eeriest
Tell em what it really is
Built pyramids, ground up from the streets
It’s that Q talk serious
What the theory is, Sunlight to 1 at night, we the eeriest
Tell em what it really is
Built pyramids, ground up from the streets
It’s that Q talk serious

Yo, see I’m a student of a game how I pay attention
You so poor that you can’t afford to pay attention
Catch me downtown by L.E.S
Or up in Flatbush, Fort Greene by DYS, who you be with
My niggas I was locked up in Spofford with
Killers that'll kill killers marvelous
I know niggas never used a gun but got bodies
You can do the math, go and ask who you ask
A1 nigga since day 1, just ask
G-Shock watch, flooded with the black diamonds
Louboutins with the spikes is for weirdos
I’m hood nigga, I don’t wear those
Still a dapper dan, design still immaculate
Gucci ain’t make that, nah, but it’s they fabric
And still I get cabbage with, punch style
Gold piece Lazareth

[Hook]

Yo, you wanna fly in the city, you gotta go to Queens
Fly out of the city, you gotta come to Queens
My borough birthed John Gotti
And other killers, big drug dealers, wild ball players
Lamar Odom, World Peace Artest
Kenny Anderson, Kenny Smith, Lefrak the best, yea
Rafer Alston, Anthony Mason, Mark Jackson on a lay up line
They got action
Supreme court where I fought, but these ball playing niggas
Rep Queens on a court
Talik and Kimani could have made it
And Raheem manchild, the fuckin' hood favorite
Orchestrated, we sort of related
Black and Puerto Rican, like Los we stay faded cause
Yeah, on the real to the real, on the real to the real

[Hook]
