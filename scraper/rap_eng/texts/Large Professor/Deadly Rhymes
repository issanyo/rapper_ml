[Kool G Rap]
Deadly rhymes the pages of rage strikes again
Killing men, women and children
Til defeat, types of shelter, helter skelter
Nobody's around here to help ya

[Shante]
Up in flames, the brainstorm rain drains your veins
The only remains is rains of brains
Fixed to mix, Shante's lyrics cause conflicts
I'm bookin' my rhymes like convicts

[Kool G Rap]
God prayed for a death wish? Come on, step up
Some tried to keep up, but never kept up
When I roll, nobody can't hold me
So they all told me to make 'em die slowly

[Shante]
The warning signs of danger read "please take precautions"
I'm giving your baby rhymes abortions
Hit the deck when I wreck, one got shot in the neck
Poison escaped through the tape decks
Confusion, havin' a need for a blood transfusion
She couldn't stop my intrusion

[Kool G Rap]
You're in the path of a lyrical tidal wave
Sound waves take you straight to your graves
Pain remains in your head, suffocation
Strangulation, wipe out a whole nation

[Shante]
On stage tryin' to recite like me
But what I really see is Creepshow 3
I size em up to die and pulverize 'em
So bad, her own mother won't recognize her

[Kool G Rap]
This goes for those, that oppose like foes
But I don't diss (I dispose)
Somewhere right near nightmare right where you might hear
Songs are long like light years

[Shante]
So here's a taste of the lyrical greats of all time
WHAT? Deadly rhymes

*Chorus*

[Shante]
Attack, ready to track the wack rappers who slack
I attract, cause you lack, you sad sack
The microphone fanatic comin' in with the impact
In fact this track, to subtract, I pack
A pile of stacks back in the sack for snacks
But I react, right and exact, cause I'm black
Got a taste, and treble and bass you can't chase
In case you wanna race the pace I got haste
To ace in your case, in your face just like mace
I replace, wreck the place and then erase, sho'!

[Kool G Rap]
I captivated, those that violated
Alienated, styles annihilated
Rappers, evacuated, faded, vacated
Waited, for my spot to be isolated
Crash and smash and bash you in the trash
In a flash, I whiplash you burned to an ash
A mass defeat, delete, rhymes are like concrete
Rap athletes all retreat to my beat
Except they don't step with pep, they get carried in a stretcher
Done by the treacherous rap wrecker

[Shante]
Start tearin' and scarin', what you're hearin'
Will put fear in, so I'm comparin'
You get tossed across like Kris Kross
To force, you fell of course, boss (so now you're lost)
All rhymes are organized like crime
That's why I titled this here design
