[Verse 1]
Yeah
I got a fully loaded cartridge and thoughts and enemies
Rhymes razor sharp, that's that rawkus energy
My heart pump Hennessy
Veins pump Don Julio, rock rubies
Assorted color stones in the jewelry
Picture that
A nigga delegatin' with diplomats
Used to pitch nickel sacks
Now I can shit a stack
Im on it
Defecatin' on your rap performers
Appeal, more the Mass
And Fash passed enormous
I don't get excited, I get ignited
Burn like a brush fire when I write it
Barb-wire for those bitin'
Titan in the ring, Tyson when I swing
Python, when the mic's on, I strike harm
Madre know I'ma drug dealer uh
Tecate sippin, my mug's rippin
Compadre stealin', the slug peelin'
Nonsense, crip'n & blood spillage in the village
No remorse shown, no love given, nigga

[Hook]
F-A-S-H-A-W-N
No, you don't know how much trouble you in
No, they just hustle, I hustle to win
Don't say I'm done, just say I've done it again

[Verse 2]
Homie
If it ain't the shells, its the gazelles
If I'm not still in a cell, I'm out on bail
Dirty, is what's under my nails, off the rail
Young homie will fuck up a scale, he hustle well
Count kale off of sellin' broccoli, never fail
Cocky, you can tell, cock is 2XL
Block had to bail
Look like, I just ate rock lobster
All these shells, shocked, you lookin pale
Why? Cause I prevailed, a hassa for the nail
You hot huh? Is it cause yo pockets lookin frail?
Memoirs of a Mobsta with a tale
Wrote pop like im Pharrell
Pop pop, two rappers fail
I once was a poster boy for poverty
Until I hit the lottery
'Po, something you gotta see
You niggas will never figure me out
I figured that, figures is what this shit is about
Motha fucka!

[Hook x2]
F-A-S-H-A-W-N
No, you don't know how much trouble you in
No, they just hustle, I hustle to win
Don't say I'm done, just say I've done it again
