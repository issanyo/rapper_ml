[Verse: Hermi7 Khalfani]
It rained many days through the Harvey Tunnel, cruising
Sunny days lacked, anticipating the movements
Homie tried to grasp the gist of what I'm spitting, the mind wouldn't give deaf ears a chance to listen
Kick it, wink, sip Henn, Fonzarific! Wood drifted, honey on my mind when I'm risen
But only for a short time cause my thoughts steady shiftin', tectonics, flipped the track over Ebonics
L, in my thoughts was easily slangs finest but never got credit cause credit would cost lying
A sellout, slander hip-hop for a handout bout time you turn leaf and make way for a new route
Navigate the game and find something that's righteous
Critically acclaimed in all instance and likeness
Loose change get tightened, tracks that get bodied
Never thought your mans would be feathering Hefty Holly
Homie marooned, depths of the lagoon
Skin a wolf for the fur, gold pieces, doubloons
I been a -- nigga, a coon, a buffoon of baboons, I never slipped of my path as I tangled typhoons
The wind blown every way, nearly toppled estates, nearly erased everything from Calico to Pompeii
Surely I've faced everything that could get in my way, I took a sip of orange juice didn't taste Aliz√©
In a rap state of mind, still "Surviving the Times", my incline was designed at the dawn of bloodline
When mother lost every child -- to them chain-linked piles
And now every born nigga gotta walk that aisle, talk that talk, see if you can walk that walk
Unconfined by a cell or surrounded in chalk!

[Verse: Haley Halflife]
Keep still G!
Now you can't hide from a real G
Look you in the face, might stare your in the grill piece
When I ask you chill, please
I'm broke where that Mickey D's, I only got a dollar and probably can't even chill, peace
Yo, pass that
My bad you ash off that hashtag, probably take ya cash back
Laid back took a a nap, forreal-o, I sit back dreams stick on my pillow
I grew up for who up, so I'mma need two cups
Mind sip all that true up, I know something you knew but--
Forgot it like that g, posted in the back seat
You know what attracts me, whoa, sip it sit it low
There's bait on that fishing pole, fall through a black hole all through the back door
But it takes time, yeah so I take mine, so it takes time
