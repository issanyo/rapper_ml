A Toast to Mr. Tagalucci
And zipping open Louis duffle bags of lucci
Bragging loosley, 'bout bagging hoochies
No logos on the clothes but the tags say "Gucci" (nice)
And everybody raise your glasses
To beautiful tits and amazing asses
Bring cigar cutters and a tray for ashes
To money burials, hideaways, and stashes
Thanks to DEA's getting slick
They used bad tape, the charges didn't stick
The lawyers, Ebanks, Sadler
Life's a bitch and I probably could've had her
Here's to no witnesses
And playing dumb like "I don't know what this is"
I'm forgetful that's why I keep my shit full
Along with alarm systems and pit bulls
Good food, still needs seasoning
Gangsta POV, that's how we sees things
It's talked about with good reasoning
Over good steaks, and sweet Riesling
Yeah, Beef is just an entr√©e
Put stacks on a boy like his name "Andre"
All the shootouts and the killings
Sympathy for bad guys, rooting for the villains
I put my money up, loot is in the ceiling
And 2 baby nines that look cuter than some children
Cheers, blood, sweat, and tears
No room for emotions or fears
It's the way, nothing more to say
I make the call we could go to war today
This is Loso's Way
