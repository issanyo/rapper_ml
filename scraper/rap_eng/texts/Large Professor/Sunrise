[Intro]
Yo!
Oh shit!
We in the mix of all this shit, man
Yo, how the fuck did we get here?
Fuck is going on?
Aww, man
Yo, what the fuck is that?

[Verse 1: Large Professor]
Sunrise in my eyes, time flies
Pick a book up and read, now I'm wise
To the fact when the duck goes quack
A snake might rattle in the ongoing battle
For props, as the janitor mops
A new mess is made, so he stays getting paid
In this world where currency rules
It's God looking at a lot of people like fools
Sniff the line, sniff the wine, peep the paper
Or just go and get your lifeline tapered
Lay back today, payback's tomorrow
Somebody's gonna have to feel sorrow
Damn, another cut-neck scam
It's the answer to what wrecks fam
For ever, even that has an ending
Better to have a blind man as a friend than
Have a friend who can't see and has sight
Beware of the man always saying "that's right"
Keep a schedule, and watch how ahead you'll
Be of the rest who slept and wept
If jealousy reigns in the heart and the veins
The blood, like mud, just clogs the brains
Hate or love, check one of the above
In the cold, who would wanna be a glove?
What's a woman that uses her body to make money?
The bomb, or a hottie?
Hear it after, rejoice in laughter
Don't and won't, a victory is postponed sometimes
For a second, but who remains checkin'
Will receive, deserters just grieve
In one hand there's a gun, in the other there's nothing
Trigger gets pulled, and both hands is suffering
Make connections fresh and add flesh
And always try to just keep the bad threshed
From the good in your thoughts, true sports
Win, even though they might've took a few shots
It's the long run that beats the wrong one
The house just dwindles of the mouth that swindles
Word up
