[Verse 1]
Young mother smoke crack while her baby cries
Young brother sell crack, carry baby nines
Baby-faced gangsters wild out commit crazy crimes
Taking anything they want without shame or pride
Stray bullet hit a pregnant momma Bed-Stuy
Lead fly, final destination her death arrives
Was she in the wrong place or was she meant to die?
And whoever's responsible they'll never find
Fuck flipping burgers, serving milkshakes and fries
Kids committing murders living in these last days and times
White kids, black kids any race or price
Shooting up they high school Satan in they minds
We see everything and yet we forever blind
Society turn away and protect your eyes
Like a horror movie but you can’t press rewind
Bare witness to reality or step aside

[Hook - 2x]
Are we learning how to live or learning how to die
Building nuclear weapons and learning how to fly
I never graduated high school I got my GED in tenth grade
And ran around Canarsie High

[Verse 2]
Young baby girl gave birth to baby girl
Thirteen brought a little baby in this crazy world
I seen the same story every block, every borough
Every town same situation very thorough
Very sad baby girl never knew her dad
Broken home, broken soul ready to attack
Young dad doesn’t even know that he a father
And some do but don’t care, or care to even bother
Plenty good parents too, but bad situations
Young dad went to war in a distant nation
Proud American that wanted to be participate
Sent home in a box or in a crippled state
We see everything and yet we forever blind
Society turn away and protect your eyes
Like a horror movie but you can’t press rewind
Bare witness to reality or step aside

[Hook - 2x]
