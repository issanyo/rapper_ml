[Verse One]
I throw incinerators at rappers that talk garbage about the Ak
They don't know me from a tree in the forest
My name's not summer, so I don't sweat it
Most y'all niggas know I cut ya like cheese that's cheddared
I been around the world like Lisa Stansfield's tour bus
Tearin' niggas up from here to West Bubblefuck
So don't front like you don't know what my name is
Before I start diving up in that ass like Greg Louganis
That's not my number one AIM IS
You take my style of speech
And live like Robin Leach and seek the lifestyle
Of rich and FAMOUS
I dare another rapper try to TAME THIS
I hit you in the ANUS
Once I reach for the damn STAINLESS Steel
This ain't the pretty boy feel sex-appeal
It's Ak, a.k.a. the real deal
I make punk rappers stutter, y-yoyoy-yoyoy-yoyo
I bring out the Das EFX in a motherfucker
I'm living larger than a mansion, you hear me?
You fear me
You're just a Little House on the Prairie
Leave 'fore Hurricane Ak come blowin' in
All you motherfuckers best to breeze like the wind
Check the news forecast
I place a Con Edison sticker on your butt
If you're light in the ass
Close your eyes, and concentrate it's time to recognize
The Ak keep brothers on checkmate

[Refrain]
Check over there, and then check over here
Just lend me your ear, c'mon listen

[Verse Two]
Nigga you just can't defeat me
Child abusers walk around, knowing they just can't beat me
So don't try to take the winner's belt
Ay yo, this ain't April first so don't dare fool yourself
It don't get no liver, I'm hitting harder than a chastiser
I flip rhymes like saliva, pounding on your BRAIN
With the sick shit I'm SAYING
I got more GAME than a panhandler on the TRAIN
Huh, it's rare if I don't catch props
I'm the Ak I tear that ass out the frame like a benzie box
You know the rules if you ain't rough
Stay on the hush
And get played like Sunday school shoes and get scuffed
I put heads to bed like newlyweds
Sing your rap eulogy
Cause now you're good as dead
Hit the deck, once I round it off like a Tec
I play you like a game of chess and keep your ass in check
Checkmate

[Refrain]
Check all around, and then check for them clowns
Check the fuckin' real sound, break down

[Verse Three]
In English, MCs can't last
Similar to a car crash, I got rap in a smash
Whenever you wanna get loose and hang out
Remember I done turned enough troops into The Last Boy Scout
Think it's lies? Then come try
Otherwise make like a librarian and keep your ass quiet
I'm out to catch the winner's cup
All you number one contenders just got knocked to the runner's up
What nigga what? I'm blowin up the spot with dynamite
Rhymes by the Ak
Airports: they amazed of me
Shit cause I fly so much heads, I have my own travel agency
Raps are fat like SUMO, slammin' like JUDO
I won't get abused like members of MENUDO
I got the art down pat, pass the courderoy
This bad boy about to start to slack
Fuck how "I could just kill a maaaan"
I'm slick and puttin' brothers out with these N-word Niggahands
Ten fingers of death, grippin' microphones
Holdin' my own, sparkin' rhymes up like rhinestones
Rippin' up challengers
Creating a mess on stage out of comedian rappers like Gallagher
My mind is filthier than a HAMPER
Dirty like a CAMPER
On top of that, I've been through more shit than PAMPERS
Fake is what I ain't
Picasso the Great don't know me from a can of paint
Listen to how the soundwaves vibrate
You can't relate, I got your whole brain on checkmate

[Outro]
Rob Swift is his name, with Akineyle in the game
You're best to maintain, as we aim for your brain
As we aim for your brain (3x)
