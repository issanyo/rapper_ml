[Verse 1 - Large Professor]
Excursion to a place unknown
Alone, didn't even bring cell phones
Out there breathing that good mountain air
No cares and I'm sincere
When I say I got love for you
Believe me homegirl, that's Word with a capital W
We could get busy, all I
Want or need is you and I be all right
And focused, I wink, you blow a kiss
Out of this world is where we gon flow with this
I can feel it, come straight from the heart
Every time we're together I'm thankful to God
For making us come together as one
And taking us to another level, I've won
Finally got my ultimate girl
All the planets align with us, we in our own world

[Hook - Fortune]
No other can catch the eye
It's you and I
In our own world
In our own world
And that's the building, never divide
Coincide
In our own world
In our own world

[Verse 2]
When I rise in the morning you're on my mind
Horizon is soaring, I'm on cloud nine
And I could just drift through days when I'm with you
So easily, all things I want to give you
Riding out of town, you and me on the menu
Spend a few quick moments and share
I could fly to the sky just as long as you there
Don't care about nothing cause we're not bluffing
About this, ain't nothing monotonous
Relationship, like an ancient Egyptian
Tale, we'll seal, and rise and not fall (???)
To the penthouse suite from the project hall
Want to walk around this earth and talk of our
Existence, in the crowd we like whispering
Man, it's love, you can feel it to the bone marrow
Yeah, we in our own world

[Hook]
