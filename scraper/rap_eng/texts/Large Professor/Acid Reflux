(Hook x2)
My brain's strange from taking contaminated acid
While you be selling your soul we assassinate assassins
Am I hallucinating?
You'll see visions of death, possessed
By homicide is what I'm obsessed

[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
Reek of puterfaction and drugs, the acid taste often lingers
Susan Atkins licked the blood of Sharon Tate off her fingers
Off the hand of Satan, hot corpse masturbation
Get my rocks off, sparking a golf course assassination
Pistol whip and kill the rich, triple six
Extremely horrible like a beautiful bitch with a dick
Every society receives the criminals it deserves
Subliminal with the words, and every visual's absurd
Dope dealer storm dancers rain down chronic showers
The cult leader cure cancer with hypnotic powers
Goon druggie tie-dyed psychedelic paint job
Dune-buggy drive-bys, heretics that hate God
Red spider acid tongue, death rider, bastard son
Empire stand as one, Hellfire Canyon Club
Crocodile confessions occupy obsessions
We personify homicide - We're the essence

(Hook x2)

"Death To Pigs" written on the wall in blood
Pestilence and sickness the war's begun
Trippin' in a coffin numb
Lift your tongue, put this underneath
Orange Sunshine, a hundred sheets
Morbid dungeons and demons a hundred deep
Grimy tornado tyrants and independent souls
Hawaii volcano, private Jimi Hendrix shows
Iâ€™ve seen the symmetry of infinity clearly, like Timothy Leary weary
Questioning every existing theory
Then we enter to the hallways of the always
Twisted like corn-braids
Trippin' like Grateful Dead tour-dates
I seen Satan and God raping your mom
Then they all melted away in globs and claymation blobs
Simulation, Play Station, X-Box the death doctrine
Altamount angels to murder-sprees with Tex Watson
The shepard sent the lamb to Bethlehem
Pentagon Nephilim, sitting in the center of a pentagram

(Hook x2)
