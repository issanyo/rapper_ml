[Verse 1 - Large Professor]
Sitting in the big house filling his mouth
Then he got up and went to go chill on the couch
And watch TV, lit up a blunt, was not breathing
Airways, for days kid, looked like a three-ring
Circus act, look at the shirt on his back
Need a neck smack, used to walk out the left rack
Now he can't even walk to the store
Need a vehicle, next he gon need a miracle
Some villains he was banging with was ill
Cause they laughed behind his back and then go to his crib and chill
And watch him smoke more and drink more
And think poor without saying shit to the boy
I seen him one day, making my way to the city
Looking like he was doing self-pity
Said man, throw the self-pity pit in the can
Basically, in a nutshell, this is what I'm saying

[Hook] x2
You gotta get off yo ass
You gotta get on your [job]
You gotta get off yo ass
You gotta get on your feet

[Verse 2]
It's going, it's going, it's going, it's gone
Opportunity only once come along
Some every-odd years, wherever I is
I seize the moment to see some Roman
Numerals, in piles and piles
With the creamy French dressing or Thousand Isles
All salad, unravel a bank roll and pile it
Then go and get another stack, rolling with the wolf pack
Main street blessings, effervescence
Ever since God called me back to the lessons
I flourished, stepped with courage, to get [er-rich]
Or richer, in either direction, you get the picture
Crystal-clear like diamond wristwear
Another hot heat-seeking missile for your ear
On fire, on the flyer in big letters is
L-A-R-G-E, bringing the medicine
Been banging ever since riots out in Cali
Remember in 85, was at the rally
Traveled the globe and the worlds beyond
Not dissing, just listen to the words in the song

[Outro]
Another public service announcement from your friendly neighborhood Large Professor
Get off yo ass, and get on yo feet!
And keep your beat to the street!
