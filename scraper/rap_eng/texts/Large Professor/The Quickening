[Intro: Turntablism]
"Here we go again"
"Live and direct son"
"You know the deal"
"This is the quickening"
"Untouchable. Un-untouchable"
"Hip hop, no doubt"
"I rap to build or I rap to ruin"
"Back up chump"
"Watch what you're doing"
"Fuck up the party before it even start"

[Verse 1: Sesta]
Yeah, with a pair of rapper lungs, and a tongue
That'll have them on the run, like it had a gun and a handful of puns
And we bad, but they're not the ones in the bag
Now we mad, we not big in Japan
If I was, then I wouldn't have a man at my house
Looking for the fucking man of the house
Saying, "Mr Baker, you're late for paper"
Let me stop ya, the name's Sesta
I'll put it next to bond
You been dancing to 80's like Jason
I mean Donavan - whatever drug he's on
You've got a tolerance so you took a lot of them
Threw you off the ground, about a centimeter hovering
First world problems, I've got a lot of them
Flying's a misery, slack Twitter following
Clesh gotta drive one, Hons get to gobblin'
T on the Valium, trying to get him off of them

[Hook: Sesta and Trials]
Quick! In a van, I'm across the land
Can't stop, it's a problem, I got it bad
It's the quickening
"Live and direct son" "This is the quickening"
Quick! Off the plane, right on the stage
Wrote a game of bullshit, but we're on the way
It's the quickening "Untouchable"
"Back up chump" "This is the quickening"

[Verse 2: Hons]
I like my symphonies bitter-sweet, my rap music obscene
Rank type mis-hosted on my Twitter feed
Got to be kidding me, you're killing my scene
They're making rap tracks fat, at least I'm kicking the beat
Yo, they no competition, not even my genre
Made that decision when they popped that collar
Oars and Large pro, wage war like Gestapo
Motherfucker, sixteen bar mode
Armed with an open bar and pack of Marlboro
Four day bender on the road, through at last so
Walked the hard road parmo-style
Old man, leaky eyed at the bar don't smile
But the crowd go wild when we rock the show
Twice 'round the country for not much dough
That's why the Hons stays poor but happy as fuck
At the front of Centrelink with my charity cup, come on

[Hook: Sesta and Trials]
Quick! In a van, I'm across the land
Can't stop, it's a problem, I got it bad
It's the quickening
"Live and direct son" "This is the quickening"
Quick! Off the plane, right on the stage
Wrote a game of bullshit, but we're on the way
It's the quickening "Untouchable"
"Back up chump" "This is the quickening"

[Verse 3: Trials]
I don't, fuck with shoes, yeah the hair is whack
And I don't even care if it match, all I wear is black
I'm on the road doing the show, an going to bed
You got The Secret on DVD and hope for the best (Psh)
Feel, we ain't making a mill', trying to get my burger upsized, make it a meal
And move from there, round town we the baddest
Gone away in the states, call him piece of garbage
Roll through the breath'o (that was exciting)
Hmm, you're not gonna fuck with the fact we're still driving?
Fact of life when you rap on a beat
Gotta pay death, taxes and management fees
Got a plan for the man from the Netherlands
Gatekeeper of the beat, cancel all the wedding plans
I'm taking a trip, I'm strippin' off, I'm taking a dip
But when he coming out there's someone there, taking a *sniff* yeah

[Intermission: Turntablism]
"Un-un-un-untouchable" "This is the quickening" (Quick!)
"Untouchable" "Back up chump, watch what you doing"
"F-fu, fu-fuck up the party before it even start"

[Hook: Sesta and Trials]
