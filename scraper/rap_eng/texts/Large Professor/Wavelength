[Verse 1: Solace]
Time Truth, the wrecking crew
Start the demo
You didn't get the message
Then you must've missed the memo
My M.O., show spectacular vernacular
Brain surgeon
Got me swerving in the Acura
Skip the salad, compose a ballad
Oil paintings up on the canvas
That was lifted from my palette
The OG's stamped the crew
We the recruits
Now we're taking knots out like a Swedish masseuse
And bless the whole block
Cop a ice cream truck
A nice clean buck while you in the dice game stuck
Ya'll Lil' Mama's on the stage of the Empire State
Tri-colored kicks lighting up the entire place
On a fast track, holding Goldman Sachs stacks
Flashbacks being broke
Now we banking on the NASDAQ
Keep the trash rap
Bottom of the bottle, yeah we tap that
Take a swig, nigga pass that

[Hook: Timeless Truth]
On the strength
Dropping gems
Get on the wavelength
Wild Style criminals in the state pen
Been awhile, touch ground
Now we made men
Move proper
Every dollar got to make cents
Dropping gems
Get on the wavelength
Wild Style criminals in the state pen
Been awhile, touch down
Now we made men
Move proper
Every dollar got to make cents

[Verse 2: OPrime39]
Recline, chill
Rhyme skill to climb hills
Sign, seal if you cutting a mill
While your diamonds on the dills
We defining the real
Why you whining like you shining
In an armored DeVille
Queens native the speech
Savor unique flavor
Skill labor, piling paper til I see acres
Save the compliments, we reign dominant
It's ominous, cold rocking it
Crushing continents
Clutch flow, out for the gusto if you must know
Fiend for O like jumbo's when the funds low
Piecing the puzzle with fat caps and Rusto's
Stomping your cypher with fat raps to crush foes
Timeless! Like the last second in a Game 7
Early retirement, settle with the pay severance
Cross the line, I'll crossfire when we blaze weapons
Our Father, Hail Mary, now embrace Heaven

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Solace]
They take a page from the playbook
And call it flattery
But their melody be sounding like a parody
And for the sake of clarity
I'm dealing with reality
Start talking salary and skip the technicalities
It's real in the field
Time to grind
Cause I'm ill with the quill when I sign my rhyme
While ya'll bail on the bill when it's time to dine
Bout time for Time Truth
Time to shine

[Verse 4: OPrime39]
On the climb, check the stock, kid
Keep 'em boxed in
Shoot the fair one
Make you feel like it's a mosh pit
Talk slick and they're telling me it's God's gift
Whip a Drop 6, shift will make 'em car sick
Frontline, ya'll the niggas that took cover
The Brook Brothers, still gutter
That's why the hood loves us
Ya'll niggas salvage the outlets to live, sucka
Architects with the outfits to mix butter

[Hook]

[Outro: Timeless Truth]
My man X-P, he on the Wavelength
R-T-N-C, he on the Wavelength
My man Roc Mars, he on the Wavelength
You know the Outdoorsmen, they on the Wavelength
