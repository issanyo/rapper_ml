The greatest lyrics you ever saw
Thought you weren’t gonna be feeling my raps
So I hit you right back, my chap, with that raw
Come near and get tamped by the sound of the Lord
Your bitch tastes nasty why you fed her at all?
I’m indefatigable a disaster unstoppable, grovel in horror
[while] novels are torn up
We gotta get thru this rigmarole
To rid the world of immoral
The principle of tomorrow will be tripled if we organize
Come along the expedition to render existence exorbitant with dignified origins
Make a difference in your individual winnings
That’s why I slang blade quit bein auxiliary
Leading what is me to see unlimited visions super positioned on the fake irationers
Mistake no hate in us
They stay the all the same to us
Shuffling paper gettin paper cuts [when will I wake up]
The stories the same here
Let me explain the way SEE-I
I State the way’s gotta change
Elaborate it’s oil and hate
Exemplify we’re running out of time to chime, noxious gas collating in the sky, crime can disappear it’s you who decides- at what rate
Illustrate a better place-solar plated-cooperating-self optimization
-
Keep that thought in your brain when you’re down on faith
I’m phazin into operation, conflagrating inoperate daysmen dazed in outer space web of imagination- awakenin the deep messenger invaginating our masonry
Gathering the days, waiting for apposition to gain alchemy, opposition perspicaciously ousted, audi blade flakin monopoly
Make fair trade and not profit only, willing to wait like they say “Rome wasn’t built in a day”
But If the potentials’ unknown to you we’re exponentially growing into a quintessential no place called home -at godspeed rate~~
Having laymans change their saying more propitious and visionary
Quote them while I wake a new day now saying “create another every day, another Rome everyday”
That’s how we make way on to something more and greater
My thoughts delve into truth intuitively the more we make of it
Carrying on an auspicious now and later for posterity
Terraforming terra firma deliberately for a new age celebrate(d/ it)
New celebrity to make it what you make of it?
Not fake a bit, transforming fake kids to not fucking fake it
The place we met was it terraqueous ?
Oh wait it was Thrace, thrice I am right
It was when I was Spartan dying in the mightiest fight for light
For thy I gave life, a mighteous flight
Now My mind just right
Die decided
Am I right now
Readily and despite being on the dole, puff the loudest dro
On the prowl in the here and now I'll be cold
Determining where i’ll go with phronesis in my dome
Oh she give me dome like 15 minutes ago
You should watch where those lips go
When you talking you might get domed
Unless you uphold the holiest flow
Wholly and whole I (feel/fill) your ho
Ask me fi doe
I’ll think about it I give you the D in the meantime tho
Don’t mean to sound dross
Just me being droll
Give a mean bitch dome, a clean bitch home
I needa switch hoes, stitch holes, swish swishers
I don’t know if this vision is permissible it’s given
Episteme of mine expressed eloquently thru this techne
Technical vocabulary magically vanishing as rappers collab with mainstream
Daemons and fiends them
They feeding them merely tuppence
We’re the media of loving
In the media for nothing
Is it me or pure scruples
To believe in me or do nothing
Redeemed a new someone
I finna do something
And bid adieu all those in fronta me
Now visiting Eudaimonic *for good*
