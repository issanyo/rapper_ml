[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
The G-G-G-G-G-GBC
The G-G-G-G-G-GBC
Is in
The
House

[Verse 1: Scoop Deville]
Hop up, hop up out the Range
It’s Devill-e in the game
With no logos on the chain
And I let my pants hang
In the streets bang bang
But I ain’t been the same since the rap game changed
A lot of suckas wanna try to take my fame
You just mad cuz all you do is the same old thang
I just laugh
Still sparking the same old flames
Slick talking, moonwalking all over LA
I love my city
Like I love my Committee
Trigger finger is itchy you know we getting it busy
You know I’m so really
Yall Milli Vanilli
I’m at the Hollywood heezy splitting a philly
I split a couple millies
Make a couple of billies
Split up the whole city and be richer than Richie
I split a couple millies
Make a couple of billies
Split up the whole city and be richer than Richie
Hey

Chorus
Rolling down the street
Sitting crooked in my seat
Head bobbing to the beat
Let the volume peak
Like uhh
No time to speak
Like uhh
No time to speak
Rolling down the street
Sitting crooked in my seat
Head bobbing to the beat
Let the volume peak
Like uhh
No time to speak
Like uhh
No time to speak

[Verse 2: Ryu]
I don’t say I’m going in
I’m already there
I’m a grizzly bear in the woods nah
Boys in the Hood got
3 dozen freaks and they all on my Woodcock
Play some Get Busy turn the club into Woodstock
Take your top off
Hop in the rideya
If you smoking some ganja got coke in the casa
If you want it you can have it I’m supporting your habit
You can snort the whole bag if that’ll force you to grab it
Dab a little on your gums and
Let it get numb
Bobbing to the words and
Weaving to the drums
You ain’t gotta front girl I know you wanna fuck
Cuz if you ain’t trying to fuck what you doing on the bus?
You ain’t gotta front girl I know you wanna fuck
Cuz if you ain’t trying to fuck what you doing on the bus?

Chorus
Rolling down the street
Sitting crooked in my seat
Head bobbing to the beat
Let the volume peak
Like uhh
No time to speak
Like uhh
No time to speak
Rolling down the street
Sitting crooked in my seat
Head bobbing to the beat
Let the volume peak
Like uhh
No time to speak
Like uhh
No time to speak

[Verse 3: Apathy]
I’m dumber than dumber gets
Much hotter than summer gets
Summer fling, somersaults, something something, summer chicks
I’m coke in the nose
Your broke and it shows
I’m dumping dummies in dumpsters with the dumbest of flows
I’m picture perfect as picture Picasso
Naw don’t picture Pablo
Just picture diablo
Lamborghinis spanish like bikinis at car shows
I’m coke by the cargo
I got an embargo
A killer like Fargo
A fucking retard tho
With bicycle helmets I grab the mic and I melt it
Ima either bite or repel it
Cuz they bite it to sell it then cut it and bag it
Cuz Ap is fishscale to them real rap addicts
