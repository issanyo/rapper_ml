[Verse One]
Here's a big fuck you
Dedicated from me to you
Think I got dropped bitch? Stop, it's not true
But if these motherfuckers won't make some moves
I'm on to bigger and better things like fuuuuuuck you
Boss is stressin', caught me restin'
Screamed on me, thought I got taught a lesson
In that case there's only one thing to do
Middle finger in the air like fuuuuuuuuuck you
All these rappers and stupid bitches
Tryin' to get involved in the music business
Yeah, I got some advice to give to you
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you
You and your mother
Little sister and brother
All of y'all can get it, family members get discovered
Dismembered, this is not a diss record but I do
Say F-U-C-K Y-O-U
Fuck you

[Hook] [x4]
Fuck you, fuck you, fuuuuuck you (FUCK YOU!)

[Verse Two]
I ain't a gangsta rapper (nah)
I ain't a trapper neither
But I'm known to carry paper like a Trapper Keeper
You're wearin' rare Nikes tonight and Ap sees ya
I bruise your face, loosen your laces, jack your sneakers
And before the night is through
I'm spillin' drinks on your crew and your wifey too
Starin' right at you like, "What you gonna do?"
Not nothin', stop frontin' bitch, fuuuuuuck you
Messy hair
Everywhere
So trendy they're softer than a teddy bears
And I ain't down to squash shit or talk shit through
So fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you
Yeah, I can't bite my tongue
When young kids learn hip hop from VH1
That's some real bullshit and y'all know that's true
So F-U-C-K Y-O-U
Fuck you

[Hook] [x4]
Fuck you, fuck you, fuuuuuck you (FUCK YOU!)

[Verse Three]
Motherfuckers stay spreadin' rumors
I ain't even gonna stress them losers
Let 'em know that
Let 'em know that
Nothing says, "Fuck you" like "Fuck you dude"
Little bitch keep flappin' her lips
Understand you get slapped for that shit
Let 'em know that
Let 'em know that
Nothing says, "Fuck you" like "Fuck you dude"
Fuck you!
Cops who clock me
Kids who copy
Crew who jock me
Dudes who cock block to stop me
Fuck you
Schemin' hoes
Evil foes
People know, the Fuck You Theme it goes
Fuck you!
Gonna flip when they hear me cursin'
Like, "Try to find a clever way to make a clean version"
They over analyze everything I do
Tryin' to tell me how to rap man, fuuuuuuck you
Sayin' that they won't play it on the air
I think it's obvious that I don't care
Well let me take a sec to think that through
Time's up, suck my dick bitch and fuck you!

[Hook] [x4]
Fuck you, fuck you, fuuuuuck you (FUCK YOU!)
