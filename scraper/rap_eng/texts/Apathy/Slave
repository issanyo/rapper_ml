[Hook x 2]
Stay strong, stay brave, cradle to the grave
I be splitting like a run-away slave
Since back in the days been trapped in the maze
Now I’m splitting like a run-away slave

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I come from the future where the people ain’t free
Brainwaves get programmed quicker than circuitry
Certainly this’ll make for the perfect story
My microchip a mental blip when they searching for me
They’ll probably shoot me in the head but won’t hurt my shortie
Cause that’s one less person could be working for free
If I go out in a blaze, is it worth the glory?
Is this Heaven or Hell or just purgatory?
I got a number not a name and my mother is the same
No free thoughts, I’m taught to keep nothing in my brain
But the people as a whole, no me, only we
And it’s deep within my soul so I’ll never be free
When I fight it they don’t like it so they send a psychic
To dismantle my mind and rewrite it
It backfired cause they ain’t as clever as me
I fight to the death even though I’ll never be free
Cause the police police run my brain
Hear em talking in my head and I’m going insane
Things are so fucked up, it’ll never be the same
So welcome to the future, ain’t you glad you came?
I’m ashamed that my ancestors got so afraid of shit
They let the government rise and form a dictatorship
Working to make the rich richer really make me sick
Economically they got the poor on a slave ship

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Motive]
You see I come from the past where I’m paid for with cash
Slave master whoop my ass if work not done fast
Now how the fuck I end up like this?
From living life in my hut with my wife and my kids
Now I’m stuck chained up from my legs to my wrists
On a trip on a ship and the ocean getting motion sick
Praying at the same place I eat and piss
Fuck the saying, I’m really knee-deep in shit now
I’m on a foreign land no longer considered a man
My life stands and any plans the white man commands
We’re so damned our minds are programmed
Ain’t no if, buts, or I can’t, or force their hand
Cause of my race I’m deeply hated for living
But got a lot of love when they’re taking and raping our women
My life crazy, it really feel like Christ hate me
I stare at the white lady too long they might hang me
Treated so harsh cause my skin’s so dark
Everything so hard, I’m protected by no laws
Life full of bullshit, if I try to flip
I’ll probably get lynched or body ripped by a bullwhip
My peoples faced with the same shit for generations
So people breed their seeds off deep hatred

[Hook]
