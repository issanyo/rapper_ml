[Intro]
Who are you talking to right now?
You clearly don't know who you're talking to
So let me clue you in. I am not in danger
I am the danger!

[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
Put in work with my bare hands but the Roscoe's loaded
And I got it for cheap mayne the hood Costco's open
No coupons accepted just the loot and the bread sticks
Move the wet in your section boy from Tucson to Texas
Take a sip of this oil and watch it simmer and boil
Decompose you send you to the Devil have him employ you
Recruit some soldiers, train ‘em to be armed with a weapon
Conditioned to be calm and collected when it’s time for Armageddon
My luggage rack bent like a crater, (with what)
Lizard skin with tons of greenbacks inside all of that alligator
If James Bond was me, he’d be way more G
Trade in that Aston Martin for a chrome Bugatti
Go mach three blast the Tragedy Khadafi
Mahdi thug cop a bird flock these doves hah
Natural born money getter like one of the Gotti guys
Conceited bastard, chip on my shoulder like Johnny Five (oh!)

[Hook: Vinnie Paz]
It's the Machete Mode hit 'em and I'll bet he fold
You can find me with the deadliest of weapons sold
AOTP to the death every sentence gold
Call a bomb squad lethal when the pen explode

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
Bars are fatal I bash your skull into Play-Doh
I'm authentic like a Mako, you faker than Sharknado
Ian Ziering MCs interfering when I slaughter verses
Get jelly like Bobby Bottleservice haul them off in hearses
The flow is gruesome but deadly I'd rather choose epilepsy
Than check for a track of yours because that shit is trash of course
It's so bad G I'd rather someone gagged me with a shake weight
Then date rape me before I peep what you laced lately
I don't care what you say's crazy, that could be lamer than Wayne Brady
I'm insane like Max Cady smack your baby, fuck you pay me
Gimme the loot gimme the loot, but you ain't got the dough you always float
You like my son's Legos you were always broke y'all a joke
Honestly I'd rather jam out to some Hall and Oates
Or the last shit Madonna wrote or hear the son of a prostitute who tell mama jokes
Cause listen to your non-dope moronic quotes
You're a rat, call your folks I leave your girl's pajamas soaked

[Hook: Vinnie Paz]
It's the Machete Mode hit 'em and I'll bet he fold
You can find me with the deadliest of weapons sold
AOTP to the death every sentence gold
Call a bomb squad lethal when the pen explode

[Verse 3: Apathy]
Cut out the racket, you ratchet, I'll beat you ragged
I'm a rabid dungeon dragon that's droolin' battery acid
I'm ravenous, Ap is savage my raps are the most blasphemous
Black magic or Black Sabbath singin' bible passages
Pass the shotty, I smash atoms and body bag 'em
It's either that, or I'm lettin bionic Rottis at 'em
The most radical, rappers get out ya riot gear
They're lightin' fires and burnin bodies when I appear
Rappers get attracted like Dracula to a trachea
Tragic when hemophiliacs travel through Transylvania
Transporter beams set to the wrong coordinates
I'll teleport ya body organs out ya body, orbiting
Your abdomen like ornaments torturing poor misfortunate
Formerly living opponents, you rappers are rodents
I have components for global thermonuclear war
Inside my brain you know my name, bitch *shall we play a game*
Aiming like Soviets in the 80's, diplomats in old Mercedes
Selection of several ladies with sections of cities
Locked, Iron Curtain for certain squirtin' my sperm
Dick as big as a Dune worm in virgins

[Outro]
Jesus, what was I thinking?
You clearly don't know who you're talking to
So let me clue you in. I am not in danger
I am the danger!
A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me?
No. I am the one who knocks!
