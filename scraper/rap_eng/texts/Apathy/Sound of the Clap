[Intro] [Apathy]
Uh oh, y'all know what that means
U ready to get into it?
Let's Go!

[Verse One] [Apathy]
My game is air tight, I can dick down dikes
I'm the flyest thing that's white since uptown Nike's
Wanna joke around, tryin' to diss, thinkin' it's fresh?
I'll hit you til your links embedded an inch in your chest
You better bow down this season, nobody's iller than Apathy
Beings in different galaxies will name their children after me
Sidewalk's crack when I'm steppin on the street
I ain't standin on the planet, it's restin on my feet
The pimp, player, the hustler, rolled into one
Breathin' air into my lungs is like loading a gun
Fuck around, y'all will have bigger problems than dressin' up as Bin Laden
And tryin to rush the president while he's joggin'
I don't even understand why you bother rockin' the beats
You would of been better off as a stain on your father's sheets
Ap is the king, rockin royal jewels that'll blind you
UFO's couldn't illuminate like my shine do

[Hook] [Celph Titled]
Comin through your city
Hit the highway burnin rubber (Say What?)
Did I stutter motherfucker?
Step out of line
You don't want none of that
You better move back
When you hear the sound of the clap

[Verse Two] [Celph Titled]
Push the limit try to beat me far
It's gonna take more than tour guides to help you CPR
See we are
Villains pullin heists, puffin cigars
Pullin' surveillance tapes out of VCR's
Retards
When it comes to beef y'all know I'm no stranger
Put the barrel to your head cause it's a real no-brainer
How am I the type to leave people frightened?
Cause my gat can sing a love song like Peabo Bryson
Motherfuckers know my repertoire's great
Puttin' heads through saw blades
My team being broke was just a small phase
These bitches won't seem to leave me alone
Even when I'm dead in my grave they still gonna try to jump my bones
Stuffin' R&B chickens outside the label building
Asking Destiny's Child if they'd have my children
I got dissed but I wanted fat hoes instead
Bring 'em to the crib and watch them crack my black sofa bed

[Hook] [Celph Titled]
Comin through your city
Hit the highway burnin rubber (Say What?)
Did I stutter motherfucker?
Step out of line
You don't want none of that
You better move back
When you hear the sound of the clap

[Verse Three] [Apathy]
I goes right for the right price to touch up your shitty flows
Got more 16's than R. Kelly home video's
Nowadays I get paid for makin' a rhyme
With major labels at my door step, waiting in line
Cause it's hard to harness the hardest flows that I design
Blow your mind, bob your head until your breakin' your spine
I stack chips, mack chicks, now I'm datin' a dime
And wear my chain all the time just to break in the shine

[Celph Titled]
Committing crime is my forte
I'm wanted in four states
For being spotted with sniper gear on all your tour dates
Shine so bright I gave the sun lessons
What's a Celph Titled verse without a motherfucking gun reference?
Cause I'm the cruddiest cat
You better study a map
And coordinate to where your body parts are landin' at
C-cl-cl-clap
We came to bring the raw back
So you can, chh chh ahhh, along with the track

[Hook] [Celph Titled]
Comin through your city
Hit the highway burnin rubber (Say What?)
Did I stutter motherfucker?
Step out of line
You don't want none of that
You better move back
When you hear the sound of the clap
