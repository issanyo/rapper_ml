[Verse]:
All that shit my parents did in the 70's got my chemistry messed up
I'm paranoid, sociopath, mentally f'd up
If I meet a bitch I know she'll eventually press up
And gas my head up, enough to empty a Hess truck
I always look a couple years younger with a fresh cut
I fess up, I'll fuck a butter face who got the best butt
Recently she hit me up, told me that she'd pick me up
Daughter's in the back seat sucking on a sippy cup
I thought it was ironic
A cycle of pretty sluts
In 12 years some young dude will be getting his dicky sucked
Hoeing ain't hereditary, it seems so unnecessary
Them bitches sucking dick until they go in the cememetary
Them young girls be idolizing Paris and Lindsey
Tara and Brittney, now all their apparel is skimpy
Skinny is pretty, self esteem is real real shitty
So they go off and show off they ass and titties
It's psychological
The entertainment scene is diabolical
They grab ahold of your soul and try to swallow you
I ain't trying to preach cause I love fucking birds
It's disturbed when I think about the shit I observe
I gotta, stop, look and listen
The way I live my life is like a constant contradiction
Cause I'm hooked on sex, it seems so complex
To view these women as more than just than sexual objects
They in they videos with they shirts off and skirts off
I'm at home, pants to my knees ready to jerk off
And I feel so torn
They pussy looks so warm
I'm trying to transform but the Internet got porn
Easily accessable, hoes that look incredible
It's hard to think that women weren't designed to be sexual
My primal instincts to sink dick in pink pussy lips
Till the day that my shit goes limp
I gotta stop, look and listen
Stop, look and listen
