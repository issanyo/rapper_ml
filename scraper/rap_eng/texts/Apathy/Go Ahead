Go (x16)

[Hook] {x2}
I don't know how to get this through ya head
That's what you wanna do then go ahead (go ahead)
I can't stop you, I watch you move instead
That's what you wanna do then go ahead (go ahead)

[Verse One]
Keep goin', keep hoein', keep throwin' all your dignity away
Different dude different day (go ahead)
Keep drinkin' till ya smashed
Keep 'em thinkin' that you're fast
Keep givin' up the ass for trash (go ahead)
Keep goin' to them spots where they tell you that you're hot
Make you feel that you're important and whatnot (go ahead)
Keep thinkin' that you ain't a little hoe
That you're still in control
Watch her: (go go!) (go ahead)
Keep havin' little one night stands
Keep leaving all your earrings on dudes nightstands (go ahead)
Keep lying to yourself, lying down for wealth
Keep thinkin' that materials help (go ahead)
Keep frontin' on your friends
Fuckin' with men who ain't shit, but he got a nice Benz (go ahead)
Keep goin' like that you'll be back on the shelf
Stank bitch you can keep to yourself (go ahead)

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Keep thinkin' that you're a popular pimp
Like them chicks gave a shit if you copped them a drink (go ahead)
Keep thinkin' you're the man with the game plan
Trying to get brains, more like you need a brain scan (go ahead)
Keep calling girls "hoes", expect them to bone
Expect to go home alone (go ahead)
Keep thinkin' you impress them with the doe that you blow
Is that so? (Hell no!) (go ahead)
Keep on leavin' your girl in the house
You'll come home and taste something funny in her mouth (go ahead)
Keep thinkin' you're a thug
You must be bent, you ain't 50% of 50 Cent (go ahead)
Keep runnin' game, fabricate your intellect
You'll probably go home and masturbate on the Internet (go ahead)
Keep goin' like that you'll be back on the shelf
Stupid motherfucker, keep to yourself (go ahead)
