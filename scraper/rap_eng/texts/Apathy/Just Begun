[Celph Titled]
Yo what the fuck are y'all thinkin'
Lettin Apathy get on the mic
That's like unleashing a fucking atomic bomb
Yo this is Celph Titled the mutherfuckin mother molester
Yo Apathy rip the spines outta these mutherfuckers

[Apathy]
I'm gonna spit an incredible verse
Your head'll reverse and BURST
Till blood chemicals squirts all over medical shirts
Professional works of arts spark exceptional words
SHORT CIRCUIT MICS and cause an electrical surge
Rhymes shine like lights off of pieces of ice
My speech is precise
Psyche like telekinesis in fights
Rhymes reaches heights of beacons and satellites
What man can scan Venus and find pieces of mics
My fetus type was genius like
Spit with the speed of light
Strike in the night
STRIP YOU OF YOUR ADIDAS STRIPE
You see this indy white
Cause you couldn't be this tight
I'mma torture your wife while my fist squeezes the vice
Which unleashes the spikes
Brains leeches and mice
Right on the beaches in spice
Till she screeches with fight [aahh]
The meanest to recite reaches for the weakest device
And releases to the people saying JESUS HE'S NICE
I'm a bad man
Managed to damage an amateur
While I slap slackers and backpackers
My raps shatters you wack matter FOREVER
Clever and still better with skill to sever your head
So BET THAT I'm ILL
On the best records erected and ripped it in record
I erupted and ruptured your wack label built into wreckage
Respect this Apathetic is magnetic electric effected
And known to charge negative when I set it

[Hook x2]
1, 2, 3, to the 3, 2, 1 so hot with the tongue I can melt down the sun
Stack raps and tons
I pack gats and guns
For tryna test Ap but I've just begun

[Apathy]
I'm electrically charged like jumper cables got attached to the mic
Jackin you white
I got a black gat with a sight [blau]
I sat up on a satellite last Saturday night
Beefin with a space rapper till we BATTLE FOR MICS
I can think about you makin shatter platinum and ice
You try flattery and Apathy will flatten you twice
Just to obtain the fame or be half as nice
You'd have to train everyday twice a day for HALF YOUR LIFE
Every emcee I see wanna be as live as me
I'm at the level of perfection that prescribes to be
I got insight
Don't even need my eyes to see
All knowin'
Nothin on earth surprisin' me
I'm on some fly shit
Some ol' open up your eyes shit
Superhero for rap
Never be the sidekick
Cats try to see in my mind like they was psychic
By I kick the lines that spine shatter when I spit
SPECTACULAR
Spectators are left spellbound
Helpless like women rape victims being HELD DOWN
I'm like a nuclear facility in meltdown
Radiate your physical makin your spirit HELLBOUND
Comin from CT
Rockin in 3d
THROWIN ROOTBEERS IN YOUR FRIDGE FOR TRYNA SEE ME

[Hook x2]
