[Verse 1:Apathy]
Yo this has gotta be the most murderous music made
Till they start selling albums that are packaged with a live grenade
Plus dirty hypodermic needles filled up with AIDS
A whole bottle full of pills and a box of razorblades
Floods and glades and biblical rapture
Y’all are pitiful, I’m poison to a typical rapper
Take it literal, I litter the ground with bones like a pagan ritual
A bloodbath, let me paint the visual
Body after body I’m legendary for tossing in more mass graves than cemeteries in Boston
I spit for an hour, I rip and devour and melt rappers like I threw the Wicked Witch in the shower
Pump your fist to the power, rip down your radio tower
I’m a dickhead that got your bitch addicted to powder
Stage dive into the crowd just to get the fans louder
We more famous in New England than clam chowder
They say I’m evil well tell em there’s more to come
I’m Megatron, Shredder, and Skeletor in one
I mumble like Mumm-Ra the spells of the undead
To summon the crack fiends, the hookers, and dustheads
It’s like the end of the world and Ap’s Moses
A priest who poses with a dozen black roses
Gimme the loot motherfucker bring Biggie back
You ain’t an innovator, you’re a faggot that piggybacks
You feel the force of your fragile nose shattering
I’m safer than the Pope in the Vatican dope trafficking
With a D.A.R.E. shirt telling kids yes shoot heroin, it’ll put some hair on your chest
I’m a monster, closet is stocked with rocket launchers
Shotties and the bodies of my AA sponsors
That’s why you hear the rifle shots at our concerts
We bosses like Michael Scott in the Office
I keep bitches in check cause my pimp hand is bigger than a hamburger helper man
Man it’s critical to give credit, nothing less than incredible
Impress predecessors then they place you on a pedestal
Spit ridiculous shit or shit’ll get ridiculed
You MCs should dive in empty swimming pools
Cause half of the time they spend half of their rhymes saying they back on the grind, that’s so predictable
Fuck a movement, spit for the DJs
Stop saying shit is a movie, it’s so cliche
You got one hot song with no replay
Value on an album is so wack these days
And you wonder why the fans never cop nothing
Frustrated every time you drop something
Maybe you should stop imitating Lil’ Wayne, Kanye, and Drake, you straight cocksucking
That’s why our true fans still fuck with us
In love with us, we like an inhaler for asthma sufferers
And that’s why these little hoes keep fucking us
My dick dangle long as the nose on Snuffleupagus
Have I led you astray yet? Ap is the safest bet, I stay on point like a bayonet
I build monsters in my laboratory, they massive and gory
Then sit back and bask in the glory, fucker
