[Verse 1: Apathy]
I’m in a dark place, I get no sleep
I feel my heart race like techno beats
I’m dead broke but I hate welfare
I’m kinda nervous that I can’t afford healthcare
I rent a shitty apartment that got a doodoo smell
So I write poetry that sound like a voodoo spell
They say pens are mightier than swords
Fuck that shit, it is time, lord
Time to stick the rich for millions
Time for crime to feed my children
Time for talk and peace is done
Time to run and get your gun

[Verse 2: Apathy]
This is for my mother and my father
My aunts and my uncles
Who taught me to be humble and that life’s always a struggle
Rats, I know a couple, I’ll catch you in the jungle
Cause I’m a Boa constrictor motherfucker, wanna snuggle?
