[Sample]:
And I won't be the same, until she is mine

[Verse One] [Apathy]:
Yo, baby girl you better cool now, using your nose like a snowplow
It's all Brand Nubian, and tell her to Slow Down
Cause L.A. can suck a bitch up like a black hole
Whoever thought the Cali sunshine could be that cold
Hollywood got them actors and assholes
I'm in the club with Crips and Leonardo DiCaprio
It's true love baby, they're all false idols
With fake titties and Scientology bibles
Walkin' downtown, relaxed in my Air Max
Stop to pour some liquor on Wilsure and Fairfax
The east coast, that's my place of birth
But L.A. gotta be my favorite place on earth
Life in the fast lane, liquor and cocaine
Shit just go together like chicken and lo mein
It's a long death, it's a slow pain
But I wake up in the morning with no shame

[Chorus]:
I hate myself today
For what I did when I was late again yesterday
But that's okay
I can't keep away, from all these rappers and cocaine
I love L.A
I love L.A
And I'm not ashamed, shame, shame
I'm not ashamed
It's the price you pay, yeah
It's the price you pay
Don't hate the game

[Verse Two] [Ryu]:
Don't be ashamed girl, make yourself a drink
Fill your mind up with Henny and take away the pain
In L.A. it never rains but you know I'll make it snow see
You don't need a coat, nope, put away the snow skis
Wizard of O.Z.'s
I got season seats
That's so high I can guarantee your nose bleeds
You want to try it? Fine
Okey dokey
You turn yourself around and you do the pokey pokey
Dancin', shake it to this dope fiend anthem
4-5 drinks, I get a little more handsome
Gorgeous
Cause I push a Porsche
And I rap
Doesn't mean I'ma support ya
Bitch never that
I'm from a city full of never beens and have nones
Where love lasts about as long as your cash does
They get excited by the glitz and the glamor
The whips, all the cocaine and the clicks of the camera

[Chorus]:
I hate myself today
For what I did when I was late again yesterday
But that's okay
I can't keep away, from all these rappers and cocaine
I love L.A
I love L.A
And I'm not ashamed, shame, shame
I'm not ashamed
It's the price you pay, yeah
It's the price you pay
Don't hate the game

[Verse Three] [Scoop DeVille]:
24 karat gold frames, sittin' on Dana Danes
Parked out front, right next to the truck
Sittin' crooked outside and
All the hoes know me
Walkin' down the street tryin' to holla at the homies
Pick me up a freak like, "Baby you don't know me."
Sometimes I think I'm just better off lonely
Put yourself below me
I wouldn't let you blow me
I'm posted at the crib just chillin' in my chones
Drinkin' on some O.E
Breakin' down an O.Z
You know I'm supposed to, do it like an O.G
Tryin' to get money, no time to get cozy
I'm on my J.O.B
