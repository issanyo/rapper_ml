[Intro] [Blacastan talking]:
The first few bars is fucked up

[Scratches]:
"I was Audi 5000" - Ice Cube 'Alive On Arrival'

[Verse One] [Apathy]:
Earth rumbling
Deity humbling
U.F.O.'s are hovering, times are so troubling
Doctors started hustling, blood starts puddling
I'm shuttering, discovering, they just started shuttling
Humans to the surface of Mars
Cops searchin' our cars to confiscate notebooks, verses and bars
Aquaman lungs live in worlds like Atlantis
Cause we destroyed the whole planet with ecological damage
Helicopters patrol, doctors chop up our souls
When we go off the Zoloft we outta control
Now we paranoid animals, A Planet Of Apes
With nowhere to escape unless we launch into space
So I gathered all my old school Clue mixtapes
And started diggin' in the crates before we disintegrate
Demigodz, fuck bitches, get money, not much else
I'm Audi 5000 'fore I pass it to Celph

"I was Audi 5000"

[Verse Two] [Celph Titled]:
They said it was a murder attempt
Cause when I punched him in the skull it left a permanent dent
Baritone voice with some nice patterns
Fuck a polar bears toe nail, I'm colder than Antarctic ice caverns
Mice and rabbits, they all looked at as snake food
But I'm hungry for bitches marinatin' in my bake roast
Stomp through like I had earthquake shoes
Showed you how to commit murder over break loops and let AK's shoot
My flow can move mountains
Bank account's a loot fountain
Yeah I need two accountants, really who's countin'? (I don't know)
My water pistol shoots a potent starch
That'll have you lookin' like the dude who stood in front of the open Arc
Intelligent war sword wielder
Reroute the ignition to your gas tank
Charles Dutton four wheeler
Demigodzilla
You should already know, I'm Audi 5000 so I'll pass it to Mo'

"I was Audi 5000"

[Verse Three] [Motive]:
The most ignorant
Every verse ridiculous
Satan sadistic
Caught in church gettin' his dick licked
Hallelujah, all praise to the Godz
The dopest nigga alive is now arrived
Fuck for the love, I'm tryin' to cash in for a mil' or two
And show you monkey ass niggas how gorillas do
Bring on the bestest, claim he's spittin' that ether boy
Bet when we meet he greet me like Tim Tebow scored
It's hoodie, two shoes, mad rude, no home trainin'
Send your bitch back, ass hurt and throat achin'
I'm Doe Rakeing, sippin' Henny at probation
A lot of dollars made off of that powder that's Caucasian
And any beef shit, no secret how I do
Battle kiss your forehead like your mama duke
The new Big Daddy Kane, Ain't No Half Steppin'
I'm Audi five G till the rat ranch dressing

"I was Audi 5000"

[Verse Four] [Ryu]:
I'm Audi 5000 G
Oh yeah, I'm outty, like a Saudi I got mouths to feed
The revolution will not be televised
What you mean?
I just spent ten grand fillin' my house with flat screens
Some gasoline and empty bottles of bourbon
The kind of cocktail party you leave first degree burns with
I'm filthy, the dirty version, no detergent
If rap was Iraq, I'd be a fuckin' insurgent
I blow the spot up, give me my 30 virgins
A place in paradise, to me it's kinda worth it, right?
Fuckin' A it is, pop the stainless
Hit him till his chest make a noise like Jadakiss
The world famous, Demigod gangstas
We the same as other rappers, except nobody hates us
I ain't even gotta say shit
What could I say?
Besides I'm Audi 5 K before I pass to Seamus

"I was Audi 5000"

[Verse Five] [Esoteric]:
We the O.G. trilogy you couldn't equal the sequel
Defeatin' Esoteric? That'll take a legend like Repo
Listen, do a, CD together
You and me? Never
I'd rather listen to Nickelback on repeat forever
Lousy mix, [?] of a southie flick, bitches with the pouty lips
Lets be Audi 5 in my Audi 6
Forgot the A
They don't ever walk away
"Let Me Ride like Dr. Dre" is all these women say
Now check it
One thing about me, I'm too wordy
Put so much shit in a song you'd think the clean version's dirty
So step up
You can try to bring about my death soldier
Curses
Foiled again like last nights left overs
Oh Jesus, fall guy like Colt Seavers, I flow with no breathers
That's a Memphis Monroe beavers
Ryu, Celph, Ap, Motive got my back
I'm Audi 5000 so I'll pass it to Black

"I was Audi 5000"

[Verse Six] [Blacastan]:
There's only 60 minutes in an hour so give me 24 of those to live
I'll load the cig and find the kid who killed B.I.G
Run him down and put 16 in his wig
Make him wanna take back the foul shit that he did
That's word to my unborn kid who ain't a fetus
Sixth man off the bench, Demigodz undefeated
Many crews fell off and their legacy's depleted
But we here for the gusto, keepin' it raw
And it's a must that we crush doe, live on tour
Crowds roar, demandin' encores and more
Shut your mall down, buyin' all the Nikes out stores
Bare footed in the villa with the heated marble floors
Wars get waged on every notebook page
Act your age, Celph Titled prolly packin' a gauge
There's no need for the antics, wildin' on drugs
Man I'm Audi 5000, I'm pullin' the plug

"I was Audi 5000"
