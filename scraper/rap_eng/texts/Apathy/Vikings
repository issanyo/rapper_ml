[Verse 1:Apathy]
Classic as hatch backs and beamers
Backpacks and beepers
Snapback hats
Fat raps and trapper keepers
I’m stacking ass cap
Fuck smack,crack and reefer
I stockpile ammo, gas masks and
Heaters
Creeps are fucked up
Call Affleck and Feema
Post traumatic stress cause
Flash backs and seizures
End of the world shit
Back track with Jesus
The truth is in the open
Like ass crack on skeezers
Kids will Tweet about me and hash tag
My speeches
Playing Call of duty
Flak jacket and Turtle Beaches
Conservative genius who wrote the murderous
Piecies
Crashin' internet surface
I’m turnin' nerd into beavers [?]
Blow your church into pieces
Travel the furthest reaches
Of the universe’s regions
Where the Silver Surfer breezes
So mind your own beeswax
You’ll never fuck with these raps
I’ll leave you with a black eye
That’s bigger than a Sleestak

[Hook: Wais P]
Whilin' like we Vikings
Snatch your platinum Breitling
Father on that right wing
Fucked 'em in they side rings

[Verse 2: Wais P]
Wais P up in this bitch
To the blink of an eye
I'm tryna down that temple jit
Now pimp it fly
These niggas spittin' dis records then apologize
Dis me
