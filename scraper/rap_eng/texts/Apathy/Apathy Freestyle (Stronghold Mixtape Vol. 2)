[Intro: Poison Pen and Apathy]
[Poison Pen]
Oh shit!
[Apathy]
Oh shit.  Hahaha.  You started?  Yeah.  Apathy.  Stronghold Mixtape.  We probably in the kitchen, poligripping on chicken.  Mother... fuckers.  I ain’t even start yet.  Yo

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Your friends are only being nice when they told you that your verses are fat
I hand you a gat—you still couldn’t murder this track
I’m certain of that.  When I attack, I work with a map
Putting circles and tax details and pertinent facts.  The search for the whack
Don’t even need the burners to clap
I’m so hot, it’s like somebody taught a furnace to rap
You better dead all of that crap that you’re working with Ap
Saying you got signed to the Rock when conversing with cats
You ain’t even a label intern—you work in the back
And pack boxes for customers who purchase my wax
How dare you say that you’re probably the next to go big
You’ve never ever had a fan like a Eskimo’s crib
I’m a superhuman, doing what these average cats can’t
Skinny as a kid, but got sent to a fat camp
What’s the odds you can defeat me when rocking these mics?
You probably have a better chance hitting the lottery twice
My game is air-tight.  I can dick down dikes
I’m the flyest thing that’s white since Uptown Nikes
Wanna joke around, try to diss, thinking it’s fresh?
I hit you ‘til your link’s embedded an inch in ya chest
You better bow down to Caesar—nobody’s iller than Apathy
Beings in different galaxies’ll name they children after me
Sidewalks crack when I’m steppin’ on the street
I ain’t standin’ on the planet—it’s resting on my feet
The pimp, player, the hustler rolled into one
Breathing air into my lungs is like loading a gun
Fuck around, y’all’ll have bigger problems than dressing up as Bin Laden
And tryna rush the President while he’s joggin’
I don’t even understand why you bother rocking the beats
You would have been better off as a stain on your father’s sheets
Ap is the king, rocking royal jewels that’ll blind you
UFOs couldn’t illuminate like the lines do

[Outro: Apathy and (Poison Pen)]
Yeah.  Mother... fuckers.  Apathy.  Stronghold.  Yo.  (Yeah!).  Y’all motherfuckers want to test?  (Apathy).  Step to your fucking face.  Have y’all walking backwards like cameramen and shit.  Uh
