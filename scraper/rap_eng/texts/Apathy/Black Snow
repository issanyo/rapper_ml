[Intro]
Ill Bill
Apathy
Brooklyn goons to Snowgoons
Demigodz, LCN
Doe rakers

[Hook] -- Apathy
Watch out where them Snowgoons go
We make the sky bleed black snow
Not after your cash, we're after your soul
We make the sky bleed black snow
Watch out where them Snowgoons go
We make the sky bleed black snow
Not after your cash, we're after your soul
We make the sky bleed black snow

[Verse 1] -- Ill Bill
I'm a diamond in the rough
Leave hollows in the gun
Leave large holes in your skull
Cause you ain't never coming home
You'll never fucking survive
I'm leaving nothing alive
Nobody's gonna escape
Everybody's gonna die
Like the angel of death
Creep up with the four-fives
And chrome nines
No love lost and no smile
No mercy, no retreat
No surrender, coke and heroin
I'm the man on the street
Like a old school metalhead
Riding dirty, mind perverted
Shooting pornos behind the iron curtain
Do more dirt than Tide detergent
Fuck peace, I'm a violent person
My mind's a distorted and fucked-up pile of wires and circuits
Uncle Howie Records there be drugs around me forever
A foundation of terror that rise together
Buck off dimes and motherfuck dames together
We fight til the motherfucking death and die together, La Coka

Chorus

[Verse 2] -- Apathy

Motherfucker I'm Zeus
In a bubble goose with Timberland boots
They try to hang me with a noose
I rip the tree from its roots
You in cahoots with Lhus
Suffer if you got a den of some hating troops
I got a blender full of forbidden fruits
The force of my flows could fracture forty bottles
Got a posse of apostles and pussy from supermodels
I'm a monster in mosh pits, powerful as Pac spits
Launching rockets from Glock clips and my six
The Mossberg moss and that kill sound clash
Only fuck thick chicks with a big round ass
Outlast motherfuckers, I'll be taking out trash
Need to get up, get out, just listen to Outkast
Ap's flows smack foes, jack dough, mack hoes
Spitting rhymes, making dictators resign like Castro
The heavy ammunition is the weapons of choice
Run up on these motherfuckers like, "Sprechen sie Deutsch?"

Chorus
