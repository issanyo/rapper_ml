[Verse 1: Edgar Wyndham]
Know I'm hip a gnarly beast who hop
Flow like water add barley yeast n' hops
Go to the CO fort Collins is the spot
On a brewery tour and here's the stops
First one we got is the namesake Brewer
In Rocky Mountains IBA big shot doer
Beer abusers know I'm stout like the chocolate
My doppelganger Bock it, ya just can't stop it
May hop out maybachs I knock back maibochs
Gotta hoptitude and I never spit stray shots
Maybe you thought I was Billy the Kidd black
Old school like 1900, never catch Z's in fact
So I scream on y'all like a red banshee
Major like Tom maybe why ya'll can't stand me
Gotta hand it to me, nice as hell up in here
So let’s head to O'dells to get some more beer

[Verse 2: Edgar Wyndham]
Drink only high quality, taxed at 90 shilling
Part Scottish like that ale I be swilling
Hit the ceiling but treat meddlers with levity
Cuz fermented liquid is the better bread for me
We is tree shakers roll the last of the bag
A cutthroat on mics, who me? I never brag
Like dag, feel like I'm on easy street
Or I drank 5 barrels and got greasy on the beat
Kind of a friek stay in isolation like the ale
Like weed pistils St Lupulin never fail
My pale brethren is from across the pond
Don't gotta be a pond hopper to catch that bomb
Over here gotta Belgium and this one is new
I'm telling you they been doing that brew
A long time too, like 1554
Rampant like up in abbey lofts in days of yore

[Verse 3: Edgar Wyndham]
Pump the kick up and then launch like a springboard
Shift into flight like a winged sword
Quick to fight, we some Army Rangers
Don't roll on fat tires but Trippel the danger
Of staring at the Sunshine during the equinox
Which is also the name of the next brew spot
Where Sunrise is golden through the stratosphere
Like Mr delicious made all their bad ass beer
No fear for the universal, y'all is antipodal
Its not my fault I'm the southern Oracle
That's never ending like satellite movement
Eclipse any emcee that try to disprove it
They abuse it an’ like Coopersmiths we build
So we sample their barrels of delicious swill
A hundred seventeen liters, flip tongue like Punjabi
Flow like the Poudre, no amount of beer can ever stop me...
