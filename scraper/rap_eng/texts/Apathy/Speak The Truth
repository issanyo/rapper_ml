[Sample]:
"Speak softly when you speak the truth"

[Verse One]:
Lyrics lyrics lyrics, not many people have 'em
Stupidity's a style so it's very hard to fathom
How people believe they're not being deceived
Oh what a tangled web we weave
If I could educate and demonstrate on how to use the 808
You'd probably hyperventalate and no, it's not for Heartbreaks
Let's take a journey through space
If I was from another planet I'd annihilate the whole human race
We're the greediest, sleeziest, two faced, the devious
Fork tongued robots controlled by all medias
Welcome To The Doll House, economic fall out
Even in recession, broke people want to ball out

[Hook]:

[Verse Two]:
And they say, don't discuss politics, don't discuss religion
That's because they want us in a constant state of friction
Constant state of fiction where we pay the politician
Where we pray to politicians, put our faith in politicians
My position?
These motherfuckers are like magicians
Big as celebrites than actors and musicians
Hell's where we're headed to
Look what they imbed in you
You think it's cheap to pay three dollars for unleaded fuel
Sucking up our revenue
Tried to write a letter to
A senator, return to sendor, they ain't gon' mess with you
Exxon had record breaking profits
They put a gun to our back and went through all our pockets
Soooo
