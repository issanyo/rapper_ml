[Verse 1: Apathy]
I've been fresh, never lettin' the pen rest
My words hold more weight, than the Hulk could bench press
Wolverine healin', hackin' at men's flesh
I'm ridin' horseback in the war rockin' a headdress
There's Blackfoot in my blood, you'll get bludgeoned
And left with the buzzards in mud with flies buzzin'
Y'all don't want nothin' you buggin'
I'm like a cold war Russian with his finger on a nuclear button
Dirtier than a dungeon or buttfuckin' a munchkin
I'm a problem with production, no discussion, I'm disgustin'
Paralyzin' on percussion, y'all cussin' 'cause Ap's comin'
On a slut he tried cuffin',  that's very unbecomin'
Cuttin' up your guts and your blood and I'll start summonin'
A demon out the depths where the sulfur and lava's bubblin'
Humblin' you humans like Zeus with clouds thunderin'
Hoverin' over blocks y'all are hustlin' and I'm studyin'
People like an alien scientist, overcome you with violence
As long as I exist I rule with an iron fist
Fuck the small talk, take you on a long walk
Out in a field and crucify you on a cornstalk

[Verse 2: Suave Ski]
Pile on the bodies, stretched out like Pilates
Stressed out grab the shotty, get iced by the Gottis
I'm connected with the most reckless, don't disrespect this
Get toasted like Texas and hang you by your necklace
Yes this is the violent truth, the wylin' youth
Creatin' H-bombs inside of the booth
Lyrically drillin' 'em, killin' 'em, I'm such a resilient villain
Fillin' 'em with a million shots, ready or not
I'm like ISIS on the border or ebola in your water
This the New World Order, cuttin' your lifespan shorter
I'm sort of a rebel, yeah I sold my soul to the Devil
At the temple and now I took it to a whole other level
Spittin' liquid metal, you don't wanna beef with the kid
I summon zombies out the ground and start eatin' ya ribs
And if you wanna fight fair we can meet where you live
I separate all of your body parts and feed 'em to pigs

[Verse 3: Merkules]
Your faulty pistols ain't got nothin' when I'm launchin' missiles
These bombs will hit you to confidante when you got an issue
The Glock will split you, you're not official, I'm non-gristle
Your squad is missin' you, softer than when ya momma kiss you
Talkin' down, I get you folded like a laundromat
Show up at your culdesac, they know that I'm the boss of that
I plan to profit, catastrophic every time I handle topics
The cash they market is garbage, I'm goin' after Targets
Fuckin' heartless, sparrin' with all my inner demons
I'm Santa Claus with an atom bomb and it's Christmas evenin'
I pull my dick out swingin' and now your chick is fiendin'
She heard that Merk will make her squirt until it hits the ceilin'
So gimme reason you'll be sure to get your jaw broken
My bars doper than raw coke in a straw snort it
I'm not jokin', your squad nod off a small dosage
And I can sense it like cop dogs when the jar open
Merk...
