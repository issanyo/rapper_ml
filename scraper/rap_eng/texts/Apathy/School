[Intro:]
"You know, in school everyone does their very best to learn good habits. So we're going to try to do the very same thing, as we sing..."

[Verse 1: Apathy]
All star quarterback, varsity letter, I drive a Jetta
A popular kid, my parents give me all my cheddar
Plus I date Heather, the flyest girl in our school
I got a very large house, with an in-ground pool
I rock Polo and Abercrombie & Fitch, I'm rich
Pompous and arrogant, makin' fun of nerd cliques
You motherfuckin' freaks and geeks are all dumb
With ya painted white face, and pierced nose and tongue
I pass my classes with ease and get a "A"
Cheatin', 'cause if I don't pass, I don't play
I'll shove you in ya lockers and I'll get in ya face
Put you in ya place, 'cause you fuckin' nerds are a waste of air
Black clothes, blank stare, dyed hair
You could die tomorrow and nobody would care
I'll knock you on the ground when all the halls are crowded
But you're just a wimp, whatchu gonna do about it?

[Hook: Apathy]
No more homework, no more books
No more teachers dirty looks
No more detentions no more "F's"
No breath inside your chest
No more homework, no more books
No more teachers dirty looks
No unpopular, no more cool
No more... school

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Four years of high school, I can't believe it's here
My senior year, waiting for the crowd to cheer
At graduation, I haven't decided my occupation
But my major in college is gonna be communications
I'm nice to everybody at school, whether cool, or uncool
I'm neutral an outstanding pupil, like my teachers say
I never missed a single day
Always on the honor roll, never less than an "A"
I help jocks with their grades, even that jerk Jeff
Who's an ass, but never would of passed class with an "F"
Kids he picks on are smaller then him, and smarter than him
Never larger or taller than him
But this one kid named Jay, that Jeff calls gay
And beats up, doesn't look very normal today
So I give a little smile and he gives one back
Then he walks by and reaches into his knapsack
I feel like I wanna run, but my whole body's stunned
I can't believe it, but Jay's got a... (huh!)

[Hook: Apathy]
No more homework, no more books
No more teachers dirty looks
No more detentions no more "F's"
No breath inside your chest
No more homework, no more books
No more teachers dirty looks
No unpopular, no more cool
No more... school

[Verse 3: Apathy]
My name is Jason, a real big fan of death
I sit home thinkin' of Jeff and I take a deep breath
How I'd love to fire 30 slugs into his chest, till nothin' is left
I'm always frustrated with stress, I want respect
Back when I was 6, I'd dissect insects and spray house pets with Windex
I'm Beelzebub on drugs, the intellect of a David Berkowitz roamin' on the internet
I'm sick of gettin' pushed around and bein' clowned
When I'm the most powerful evil being in town
I wake up at 5:30 and stare into space
Walk into my parents room and shoot 'em both in the face
Take a shower get dressed load my weapon for school
Walk through the hall, step over the large blood pool
On the bus with a semi-automatic in my knapsack
Smile on my face, as I sit in the back
Then I step into the buildin' and I almost feel invincible
Wave to the nurse, say hi to the principal
Walk to to my locker, everything seems slow
Then I see Jeff... and here we go
Weapons out the bag, people stop speakin', girls shriekin'
I start shootin' rounds till Jeff's chest is bleedin'
His head explodes then I start to reload
Nobody can hurt me now 'cause I'm in murder mode
Fire at everybody that's directly in my sight
But layin' on the ground is somebody that I like
This girl who I've known who's always nice and talks to me
Crawls to me, coughin' up blood and awkwardly
Whispers two words right before her head drops
She opened her mouth and said, "Please, stop"
I could never begin to describe the way I felt
I dropped to my knees, turned the gun on myself
And pulled the trigger
