[Intro]
This shit is light work!
It’s time to stack the bar on 'em
You know
Hey yo, Kwest talk to 'em
Come on

[Hook]
You’re lightweight, and only force me to cause casualties
Call me the specialist, professor at this rap science
Vocal streetsweeper, buck shots through the speakers
You’re searching for signs of the end, well I am that
You’re light weight, it only force me to cause casualties
Call me the specialist, professor at this rap science
My city never sleeps
You’re searching for signs of the end, well I am that

[Verse 1]
Peep the way we play it
Y’all start, we finish
Car bombing, no Guinness
Then we go about our business
Yapping like you acting wild
The goonies hanging out the back Denal'
Will pat you down and leave you au naturale
Shoulda known by now that we wreck it
Cool, calm, collected
Till y’all disrespect it
Temperament of like an ill rotti
Strictly for the thrill
I'll probably leave a chilled body
Lifted off my skills
Oddly enough, they’re fronting like their pockets'll bust
And that a homi's nothing 'til they're
Getting robbed for their bucks
Could give a frruck about your knolly
Of that molly and puff
Stop with the fuss
Come on, your shitty topics get flushed
Between the lines is where we live
Them evil kids are on the eve of sneaking in
And tweaking off the leaf and gin
Another move and dude, it's checkmate
So let me set the rec straight
Or catch some fucking holes up in your chest plate

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I’m the artful dodger, villain and rogue scholar
Rappers trying to pose like Vogue should not bother
The author, poet and father of King Arthur
The archer, harder at work than a Amish farmer
The farther, the further the earth and the sun circle
A ceiling inside a circular ship, the soul burglar
Bird in the hand
Drive-by music for fans
Only a few will understand
If you get it, you’re the man
Ap’s highly in demand
My brain scans set off red flags
Like rape vans at lemonade stands
I just bought a pair of Ray Bans
For like eight-grand
'Cause I'm Cyclopse
My eyes turn towns to wastelands
Y’all are fragile, trying to shake hands with an ape man
Take damage
Metacarpals wrapped in an Ace bandage
I’m the Bermuda Triangle where planes vanish
I paint canvases with strange, deranged antics

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I walk a rugged path
Rittled with skeletons and tons of ash
My ears polluted with this music 'bout your lumps of cash
These thoughts of bloody baths
Will pass, so I just shrug and laugh
And grab the pad and script some shit
To makes you jump and spaz
Enough’s enough we out the rough
Swinging them blades of justice
Coming directly for your neck
And yes, I shaved the cuspids
Engrave the muskets
So y'all suckers really get the point
And spark the revolution before you can lift the joint
My words and actions
Swerving past you, over top your head
We out for props and cred
It's what gets done, and not what’s said
Shit, treat your facial like some rare wax
Scuff the Air Max
Will get you blown just like an air sax
Face the facts or catch a rude awakening
My crew’s basically breaking in your favorite station
So my tapes could spin
Spitting in the face of sin 'til we’re dead and gone
Repping the F dot click, so get your letters on

[Hook 2X]
