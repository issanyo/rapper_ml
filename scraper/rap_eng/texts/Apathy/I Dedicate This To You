[Clip from A Bronx Tale]

[Intro]
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
I dedicate this to you
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
I dedicate this to you

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Back in ‘97 had a fucked up year
Weighed a buck-eighty wet and had fucked up gear
Drove a blue Buick Century filled with cassettes
I was broke as shit, more bills than checks
I met you at the mall and you was working with Claire
It’s kinda crazy cause you wasn’t even supposed to be there
I remember it all, that was 14 years
Then we stayed together 5 then the moment I feared
Now here comes the tears, here comes the hell
Here’s the part of the story that’s still hard to tell
When we had to split cause you had to grow
And I didn’t understand, it just crushed my soul
You moved away, I toured the world
Year after year still missed my girl
You dated some dude, I swore to God it was a wrap
I thought you’d get married and I’d never get you back
Even when I had a chick I would tell you I loved you
Calling late at night and getting you in trouble
Then things fell through with your man like a part of some plan
That got me stacking dough to put a wedding band on your hand yeah

[Refrain: Tosha Makia]
Always cry when you tell me that you’d be going back on the road again
Tears in my eyes tell me that you’re the man some day I’ll be marrying
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
I dedicate this to you

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Dear Us, if anything should ever go wrong
Just remember all the reasons why I wrote this song
When I hit rock bottom almost lost my mind
You were right by my side telling me I’ll be fine
When my own group tried to treat me like Syd Barrett
You got me cleaned up, when we stayed with your parents
And you always came back with the physics of a boomerang
I guess the human heart’s smarter than the human brain
When we were young I turned you into a freak
Having Cape Cod sex seven days of the week
From the Ocean Mist shows you were there from the start
You’re like the left ventricle, the biggest piece of my heart
Kept your old love letters and them naked pics
Even when I dated other chicks they wasn’t shit
Fantasizing about fucking you and used to pretend
But now I got you back, I’ll never lose you again, you said

[Refrain: Tosha Makia]
Always cry when you tell me that you’d be going back on the road again
Tears in my eyes tell me that you’re the man some day I’ll be marrying
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
I dedicate this to you
