[Verse 1: Apathy]
I'm like Frankenstein when I'm makin' rhymes, I be takin' lines
Put 'em all together like a monster that be breakin' spines
I'm a god that existed since the ancient times
In a circle, in a star, sippin' pagan wine
'Cause it's basement time, back to the basics
Back to Egyptians who piloted spaceships
It's the key to the tomb of King Tut
It's that dick in a slut that rearranges her guts
I'm the Iron Sheik throwin' the beat in the Camel Clutch
And vaporize your video, leavin' your camera crushed
Camera crews document my path of destruction
I'm a giant black hole, mass and matter get sucked in
An alien abduction, barbarian production
Tractor beams paralyze, you can't even function
The key to the vortex, or your cerebral cortex
I'll kill you from across the street sittin' on my porch steps

[Chorus: Filth The Enabler and Apathy]
The key to success, the path to destruction
An alien abduction, barbarian production
The key to success, the path to destruction
Ap’ll shoot 'em from his porch and I'mma body bag 'em

[Verse 2: Filth the Enabler]
The key to success, the path to destruction
The masses in mass under massive assumption
The last of us blasphemous, cancerous junction
These rappers just clash and get smashed into dust when
They jockin' on a Herculean task, sonny it’s Dirty with Ap
Deterrence with a purpose, serpents in grass
Satan’s soldiers sir, be certain of that
Hell-fire and brimstone my heat wave will leave a permanent rash
The symbolism lives within your vision, the key to imprison Women and children, hidden conviction within a simple system
The villains vision and mission’s positioned and I’m wishin'
For riches and blissfulness, infinite wisdom
Canadian Crime Minister, keys to the city
Enable ya, I’m sinister, keepin' it Filthy I'm...
Runnin' with the torch, these suckas lollygaggin'
Ap’ll shoot 'em from his porch and I'mma body bag 'em

[Chorus: Filth The Enabler and Apathy]
The key to success, the path to destruction
An alien abduction, barbarian production
The key to success, the path to destruction
Ap’ll shoot 'em from his porch and I'mma body bag 'em

The key to success, the path to destruction
An alien abduction, barbarian production
The key to success, the path to destruction
Ap’ll shoot 'em from his porch and I'mma body bag 'em
