[Intro: Apathy]
Apathetic, Dynamic Syncopation, Demigodz baby, it's like that
Yo, I see you little soft cats at my shows thinkin' you can rhyme, thinkin' you're a superstar 'cause you go to your little open mics or get in your little battles. Y'all are little suckers son, I'ma pimp slap you, Trife-A-Saurus Rex!

[Verse 1: Apathy]
You can't handle the heavyweight, I'll blow your spine
Like imaginin' a hoe, I could blow your mind
You cats at shows don't even know your rhymes
You better start payin' your hype man for overtime
Every other line seems to be a quote from mine
Like if I was Biggie Smalls and you cats were Shine
I'll smack you blind, suplex and crack your spine
Snatch your shine like acts of crime, then slap your dime
For trynna stand in front of a punk-ass man
Throwin' upper hands like my fists won't land
I'm the diabolical deadliest biological war
The highly volatile raw, fry your molecules more
Than an atomical bomb, the comical dawn
With your aunt and ya mom on both arms at ya prom
Gotcha little sister in her bedroom strippin' her thong
Talkin' to me on the NET at Apathy.com

[Chorus: Apathy and Celph Titled]
You know it's pimped out, why would you ever want to step
Or flex, flex, flex with the Trife-A-Saurus Rex
You know it's pimped out, why would you ever want to step
Or flex, flex, flex with the Trife-A-Saurus Rex
You know it's pimped out, why would you ever want to step
Or flex, flex, flex with the Trife-A-Saurus Rex
You know it's pimped out, why would you ever want to step
Or flex, flex, flex with the Trife-A-Saurus Rex

[Verse 2: Apathy]
My heart pulsates beats and bumps bass 'til my pulse rate
Developin' a skeleton with metal in his skull plate
Headbutt your dome with the impact of lead buck from chrome
I'll earthquake and crush your home... base
Toxic waste struck the clones so doctors race
To reconstruct the bones and replace
(The chromosomes in your face), I'll steal your soul
Throw it through the ozone and let it roam through space
The underground's been polluted by you little soft suckers
(I really don't enjoy it when they say motherfucker)
Well motherfucker guess what, I'm mentally wise
Whether parentally advised or intellectually high
I'm arrogant, talk down to inferior fags
My head's so big I'll use trash bags for do-rags
You trynna run up on Celph with devils and shit
He'll sign you... (if you let me fuck your bitch)

[Chorus: Apathy and Celph Titled]
You know it's pimped out, why would you ever want to step
Or flex, flex, flex with the Trife-A-Saurus Rex
You know it's pimped out, why would you ever want to step
Or flex, flex, flex with the Trife-A-Saurus Rex
You know it's pimped out, why would you ever want to step
Or flex, flex, flex with the Trife-A-Saurus Rex
You know it's pimped out, why would you ever want to step
Or flex, flex, flex with the Trife-A-Saurus Rex

[Verse 3: Apathy]
Yo, I want the fame and fortune, treasures and wealth
Young girls dream about me to pleasure theirself
I went straight to the finals, skip the audition
Spit some raw writtens and ripped the competition
Stuck chicks on tour, grabbin' their hair
I'm havin' affairs with pairs in extravagant lairs
Come home to my wife and she's packin' my wares
Swingin' at me with a steak knife, stabbin' the air (Get the fuck out!)
(I'm the Trife-A-Saurus Rex), baddest cat in the pack
Rollin' with Celph, (a black gat strapped in the Ac')
I make calls to terrify, babies run in the street
Cop dough when we do show with Governor Pete
Got my brothers in the family and blood's thicker than water
It's deep, I'm the Godfather to Open Mic's daughter
And all you rappin' bitches who wanna provoke and battle...
Step to Trife-A-Saurus or the Eso-pterodactyl!

[Chorus: Apathy and Celph Titled]
You know it's pimped out, why would you ever want to step
Or flex, flex, flex with the Trife-A-Saurus Rex
You know it's pimped out, why would you ever want to step
Or flex, flex, flex with the Trife-A-Saurus Rex
You know it's pimped out, why would you ever want to step
Or flex, flex, flex with the Trife-A-Saurus Rex
You know it's pimped out, why would you ever want to step
Or flex, flex, flex with the Trife-A-Saurus Rex
