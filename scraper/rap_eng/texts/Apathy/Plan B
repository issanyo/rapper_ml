"When two immortals engage in combat, what can be the outcome?"

[Intro: Apathy]
Apathy. Illus. Yeah

[Verse 1: Apathy]
My secret identity, hidden from my friends and my enemies
The origin of power where I harness my energy
My fortress deep within the forest
Bones liquefy, my skeleton and my body turns formless
Mass men metamorph shapes and teleports
Leave a trail of corpses, attack with hella-force
Meet me on the heliport, we goin' to Gotham
Shatter Batman's back with a bat to his spinal column
'Cause I fucked Vicki Vale without a condom
He caught us in the act, now the memory haunts him
I'm the wickedest villain, spillin' chemical on your children
That'll turn 'em reptilian inside a scientific buildin'
I'm killin' about a million little innocent civilians
And chillin'; still in my secret location on top a hill an'
Narratin' this adventure like Stan Lee
I narrowly escaped, time to start up my plan B

[Scratch Hook]
Thinkin' of a master plan
I'mma lead you away from drugs and petty crime
Thinkin' of a master plan
Lead you away from wack beats and rhyme
Thinkin' of a master plan
I'mma lead you away from drugs and petty crime
Thinkin' of a master plan
Lead you away from wack beats and rhyme

[Interlude: Esther Anderson in Sanford And Sons]
"You are the lowest of the low
And the meanest of the mean
And the baddest of the bad."

[Verse 2: Illus]
My secret identity, created by corporate entities
To brainwash the youth that emulate me
And sell them empty celebrity insanity
Until they finally celebrate their own enemy
Scumbag drug dealer destroyin' communities
Treatin' women like punchin' bags with impunity
Pushin' the poisonous purpose with no immunity
A loser stayin' high every oppurtunity
I'm a slave to the man's plan, exploitin' the damn dam
Profited from death like a Klansman
Ignorin' history, ignorance is bliss
I'm a tool for the prison industry makin' 'em rich
A wannabe killer seller crack to the children
RiFF RaFF actin' like a [?] just to make a million
Kendrick'll push a [?] same shit different beat
Schoolboy trash, litter in every street
A base head like Chief Keef shoulda stayed in school
Never a Wiz, too faded like damn fool
Pretendin' I'mma boss like Ross fakin' game
Unoriginal like A$AP bitin' name
I never learned from my elders, been in the system
Too busy buyin' crap like Gucci to ever listen
Fancy trash like Iggy fakin' shakin' ass
Cookie cutter rap, pure wack for the mass
All these wannabe Lil Wayne monstrosities
Rappin' like they probably constantly practice sodomy
Same squeaky voice flow and topic, B
A copy, of a copy, of a copy, straight monotony
Mac Miller, G-Eazy gotta be kiddin' me
We gotta stop, Hot 97 is killin' me
My brain's rotten, all this negative hostility
But I can't 'cause I'm caught up in the system see
'Cause I'm delusional like Eminem thinkin' he's a top five
Rap God, spittin' all those meaningless wack bars
Makin' me laugh hard, a grown man
Actin' like a child is irresponsible, wasted power
'Cause if you ain't sayin' nothin' don't include your name
Among Kris, Chuck, James, Rakim, and Kane
God MC's that uplift to fight the power
Not like these tough guys frontin' when they really cowards
Got me thinkin that I wasted my life
Idolizin' bums time to get myself right
And stop livin' in this villainous fantasy
Gotta remove the mask, time for a Plan B
