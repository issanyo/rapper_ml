[Sample]
"Now it's a different song"

[Verse]
"We used to"
Speed up the sample
Now it's slowed down
Watching the record go 'round
"We used to"
See bitches front
Now they go down
They think it's a way to be down
"We used to"
Beef to get known
To each is his own
But I'ma just spit to get chips
"We used to"
Do the same shit that you do but much better
We [?] to make all this cheddar
We sick of your stupid shit, raps are robotic
They're dumb are retarded and plain idiotic
I'm new and improved
Fresh and renewed
Sick of this bullshit, especially you
So you can do that, I'ma do this
You mind your business and we'll coexist
Cause everybody listens to the same thing
Over and over and over again

[Hook]
I'm not gonna do it
No more
I'm not going through it
No more
I'm not gonna do it
So long
"Now it's a different song"
So sing along
"We used to"
