[Intro]
I'm just a kid from Boston tryna do the right thing
Yeah, C'mon

[Verse 1]
I was born as a loaded gun
The doctor cut the cord
Slapped me on the ass and he told me run
And outisder from the gate, that's my the fate
I'm the only son
Dorchester, Mass. where it all begun
I was bent with a heart full of chaos
To which it went
It would never take a day off
So whatâ€™s the upside
Tell me where's the pay off
Just a fist full of pills, I can't stay off
I gotta a pistol to gamble with some, play the hand again
Hear the jam rock, shamrocks and shenanigans
Old man Flannigan, had another plan to win
But if I run the scam I'll probably end up in the can with him
And I'm tryna go to war poe, or end up on the prayers list serving all souls
Everybody on my block got these eyeballs
Will I make it out alive only God knows

[Hook]
(Why, am I treated so Bad), Am I treated so bad
(Why?) why you treat me so bad too baby?
(Am I treated so Bad) Huh, Apathy
(You know what)

[Verse 2]
I feel God assassinated my father wish cancer, so am I religious?
I bet you could guess the answer
A sucker for a clairvoyance and necromancers
Who spent his last dollar on booze and exotic dancers
I grew up with no morals and really bad manners
With white boys who act more black than Black Panthers
Puerto Ricans who drop n-bombs more than the blacks do
Who show respect to homies who passed with neck tattoos
(Rest in peace!)
Though we treated like the bottom of the barrel
From the look of our apparel to the blood in our bone marrow
Never known for sophistication and intellect
Just for pregnant hoes who curse and smell like cigarettes, Walking pieces of shit
Cheap as it gets
Blow the whole tax maternal on clothes sneakers and kicks
So I leave 'em this
Fuck if they hated the mess
Suck a dick
Cause am sick a gettn' treat so bad, yeah

[Hook]
(Why?) Why?
(Am I treated so Bad), can you just tell me that though, please
(Why?) Why? Huh
(Am I treated so Bad) You know
(You know am all alone, while I sing this song) Yeah
