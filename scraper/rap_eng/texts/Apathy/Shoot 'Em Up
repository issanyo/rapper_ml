[Hook x3]
"Shoot 'em up, shoot, shoot, shoot 'em up"

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Yo I never tried to play some crazy gangsta role
And y'all be fucking 24/7 it takes its toll
But if you threaten what I love then I'ma place a little hole
In the center of your skull and extract your soul
My whole crew sits around and gets high all day
To defend where we live like the IRA
I'm not Sean Taylor mothafucka keep this in mind
"Cuz I got myself an uzi and my brother a nine"

[Verse 2: Motive]
Yo Shoot 'em up
Nah, that ain't my steez
But if niggas act it's guaranteed ratchets gon' squeeze
And nothing since a youngin' been attracted to beef
Not accustomed to runnin', just to packing the heat
'Mo's no average emcee, just rapping on beat
Got niggas to ride with me, and I don't mean passenger seat
These rappers thinking that some fans, really that dumb mans
Sold plat and crack and you're known as a gun man?

[Hook x3]

"Startin' shit in my hood, I can't have it yo"
