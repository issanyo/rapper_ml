[Refrain:Apathy & Blue Raspberry ]

You girls are all the same
You girls are all the same
Same problem, different name
You girls are all the same

You guys are all the same
You guys are all the same
Same problems, different games
You guys are all the same

[Verse 1:Apathy]

I hate to stereotype but most of y’all are very alike
Acting slutty when you swear that you’re the marrying type
That’s why we never try to turn a ho into a housewife
I’ll admit it, hit it and quit it, sounds about right
With them girls, your wife, the ones who ain’t disposable
Tend to be uptight and just a little too emotional
Quick to start a fight and quick to tell you they’ll get over you
The one you looking at, the front door they wanna go with you
I’m trying to keep it all in perspective
When they get possessive it’s slightly obsessive
Wanna know the name of every girl that I slept with
Trying to check my text messages is excessive
You need to be cool and don’t rush us
Moving in them shampoo bottles and toothbrushes
Confused, we ain’t used to them luffa sponges
Different chick, different name
You girls are all the same

[Verse 2:Apathy]

I know what you’re thinking: that guys only want one thing
Never want one girl, we want more than one fling
Two-timing two-faced we don’t give two shits
And usually all our fantasies involve two chicks
The guys you want seem so non-existent
Ones who ain’t ignorant or over-persistent
A guy who doesn’t have a phobia of commitment
Not phony or distant, got the proper equipment, right?
You need to keep it all in perspective
If he seem protective he’s probably possessive
Wanna know the name of every dude that you slept with
Going through your emails like he’s some detective
You need to be cool, just don’t sweat him
And if the motherfucker start acting up dead him
If he threaten to leave believe you should let him
Different dude, different game
You guys are all the same
