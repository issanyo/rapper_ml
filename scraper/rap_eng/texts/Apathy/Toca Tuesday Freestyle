I'm disturbing, submerging scalpels in your flesh like a surgeon
Emerging, after all the rest get burned in the furnace
Verses will arise like a Phoenix, I'm Jesus look into my eyes
I'm the savior mixed with Satan, no surprise
I'm American, my mental terrorism televised
I'm the angel, the Antichrist, all in one
I'm the priest, I'm the thug, I'm the nun with a gun
I'm the Pope, the Colombian who imports dope, police who pump coke that they stole from the broke
I'm the 17 year old rocking fake dookie ropes
I'm the one who think that 9/11 shit was a hoax
Got a Glock, Rottweiler, and a pocket full of cash if the world goes crazy when the stock market crash
Dead in the middle of a Ritalin binge, dead in the middle of a bed with identical *Twinz*
Cause I clean it up like Clorox, when the floor mops
You hear the beat knock, Apathy don't stop
Chillin' with my brother right here Tony Touch
We out in L.A. sticking up Kogi trucks
For that barbecue harm ya' crew, destroy the suckers, emcees wanna' step?
I crush mothafucka's
Down to their molecular structure, into their atoms
Apathy is dope and you'll feel your brain spasm
In your skull and cranium, I blow emcees up like titanium mixed with uranium
Apathy is draining em', every time I rock up on the mic I be dope, blast off like satellites, can't cope?
