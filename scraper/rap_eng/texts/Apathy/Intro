[Intro: Celph Titled + Gylan Kain]
This is dedicated to motherfuckers that's been down since day one
(Shotgun cocks)
Welcome to Chrome Depot
Like we always do about this time

[Apathy]
Hahaha, yeah, two double-o deuce
Demigodz Entertainment, Ill Boogie Records
Creeping while you're sleeping
Rappers on some abstract shit?
Nah, loc, MCs on a motherfucking mission
You wanna take a trip to the Chrome
Let a motherfucker like Ap know
Y'all soft aloe landelin fools never learn
We ain't battlin' no more, we ain't makin' diss records
We goin' to shows and punchin' motherfuckers in the face
You think you dizzown? You bound to drizzown, biatch
Peace to my homie Celph, another platinum hit, playa
Peace to Captain Back-slap, don't save her
She don't wanna be saved, really doe
To those that don't know, you can get these motherfucking nuts
Y'all don't see Esoteric, y'all can't see L-Fudge
Frankly, y'all will never see Louis Logic, or Rise
Y'all motherfuckers can get the bizzalls in your mizzouth-

[Celph Titled]
Yo, yo, yo, yo Ap, man
Yo, what the fuck are you doing, man?

[Apathy]
Aw, shit, bring it back

[Outro: Solomon Burke + Celph Titled]
Get out! Get out! I don't love you no more!
Yeah, fix your face, motherfuckers!
