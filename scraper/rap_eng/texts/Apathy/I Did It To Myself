[Ryu]
Can I get a Guinness?

I coulda spent less time whining and more time grinding
Coulda spent less time wyling and more time rhyming
Concentrate less on Ryu and more on Ryan
Spent checks on my family and less on diamonds
But I'm only human, I'm consumed by some fucked up habits
Unfortunately life don't come with an instruction packet
I really wish it did, I put this on my kids
If I knew then what I know now I'd be filthy rich
I shoulda listened to my momma; got a scholarship
Got a job and go to college like my father did
Who knows what coulda been? Maybe I let it slip
Because I was too focused on getting into stupid shit
A little stupid kid, shoulda been locked away
I coulda been a doctor, but who's to say?
The only doctor I wanted to be was Dr. Dre

Uh, I did it to my goddamn self

I never needed help I was gunning for the gold
I was raps Michael Phelps see
That was how i felt then they put us on a shelf, We
Thought we had advantages from standing next to LP
But it wasn't helping, if anything it hurt more
When the people handling your biz are on a world tour
I ain't got the words for the things I wanna say
Coulda spared a little air while you watching us deflate
But I coulda spent less time bitching and more on business
Coulda spent less time dying and more time living (I'm alive!)
Shoulda shown solidarity instead of division
I coulda learned how to drive instead of just getting driven
But I thought I found my direction but still couldn't read it
Apparently IKEA had them printed up in Swedish
Please believe it, I can't complain, Jesus, you know why?

I did it to my goddamn self!

For delf, for dolo, the wealth, the fame, the shows, the planes, the photos, the fans that still with me see me on DeSoto
Never heard of Fort Minor but they love Marco Polo
Fish outta water guess I would never learn to swim
Either I was outta breath or had a shorter fin
I know what the problem is, maybe it's the cigarettes (cough)
Maybe its the booze, the free food, the women, yes
Yes, maybe everyone's right maybe I don't get it yet
Maybe it's my own fault I don't got a blingy neck
I'm just trying to get a check, not the one that Jiggy gets
Just enough to save up so I guess I gotta spend
Less time fussing and more on busting
Less time talking shit and do songs with substance
'Cuz 2012 is coming and I'm like 'fuck it'

IMMA DO IT BY MY GODDAMN SELF!
