[Intro]
8th, drop that shit

[Verse One: 8th]
Well I'mma start it like this man
I ain't the one you wanna be dissin'
I promise, you don't really wanna start any friction
I heard the shit you poppin' and it's honestly sickenin'
The type of shit that's only good for clogging the shit can
I'm about to flush that, I'mma sucker punch rap
Hot enough to the point to where you wanna snuff back
And it takes just a little tease
They call me 8th cause the symphonies
That I'll make will stay till infinity
Raising the penalty, tellin' the industry "fuck off"
If they sayin' 8th and Apathy ain't the jump off
The future's a grenade and any day it could bust off
That's why you see me in a hearse, speeding like "What law?"
Dippin' around the corner, thinkin' about your daughter
I ignore her cause she's already clingin' onto my balls
I'm a hear tbreaker, the shop, looks could cause a lot of danger
As far as pussy goes, let's say I'm not a stranger
A lot of anger and hate aiming at 8th's fame
What we makin' ain't great?
Pssst
Say what?!

[Hook] {X4}
Hell nah
Nope
I ain't the one you wanna fuck with

[Verse Two: Apathy]
It's no wonder why these gold diggers on the balls
Cause the palace is as lavish as Taj Mahal
Us average?
Hahaha, not at all
I simply speak and freaks wanna drop they drawers
Motherfuckers lost they mind, you buggin' y'all
You're from New York and speakin' with a southern drawl
Lookin' sissy all prissy with your ditsy blond sluts
Kinda iffy, think ya spiffy in your pretty Von Dutch
Physical basic as bitches with those Tiffany bracelets
I physically break it and have her screamin' "Ricky engraved it!"
Same chick who love her boyfriend so damn much
Locked down but one round and she's down to fuck
I ain't tryin' to disrespect, you ready to fight me
When you need to keep your wifey in check like Nike's
Rappers, rappers, rappers, I'm tryin' to tell y'all
You fuck with Ap?
Hell nah

[Hook]
