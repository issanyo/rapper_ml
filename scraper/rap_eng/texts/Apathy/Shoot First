[Chorus: B-Real and (Celph Titled)]
Shoot first, ask questions last
(Shot gun pump bring a blast from the past)
Shoot first, ask questions last
(You better run fast, motherfucker run fast)
Shoot first, ask questions last
(Got a nine in the waist, .45 in the stash)
Shoot first, ask questions last
(You better run fast, motherfucker run fast)

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Just gimme a reason
I'm squeezin', til you stop breathin'
For treason, I got shotguns like duck season
The world's comin' to an end
A.P. with my A.K., me and my little friend
T-minus 10 seconds and I'm (blastin' off)
I'm the I.R.A. with a (Kalashnikov)
This ain't rocket science
It's machine gun math
Cause I'm armed to the teeth, see my heat, when I laugh
I'm the chief on a warpath, fuck knucklin' up
There's a reason why my niece call me "Uncle Buck"
Some cracker went and fucked our whole gene pool up
Look how many white kids, go and shoot their school up
You on X-Box Live shootin' at a dead mutant
In real life, we got more guns than Ted Nugent
My shit bangs, not all of that emcee jive
Fuck an MPC, I got an MP5 and I

[Chorus: B-Real and (Celph Titled)]
Shoot first, ask questions last
(Shot gun pump bring a blast from the past)
Shoot first, ask questions last
(You better run fast, motherfucker run fast)
Shoot first, ask questions last
(Got a nine in the waist, .45 in the stash)
Shoot first, ask questions last
(You better run fast, motherfucker run fast)

[Verse 2: B-Real]
So when I get lifted, I'm gifted
The paradigm shifted, I flipped it
Took an Ap beat, and I ripped it
I ain't Mike
But I'm just like a Thriller, damn
I'm feelin' like I could just kill a man
420 hits, I take money hits
And squeeze triggers, like a Playboy Bunny's tits
I shoot first, get the loot burst
Quicker than a hot slug, comin at ya crew, and I could do worse
You don't wanna see that, leave that
Yeah, I bring the heat to the party, like a DJ brings the beat back
I got a weed sack
You might get high a little
Instead of gun smoke, you might wanna try a little
You wanna buy a little homie, that's a nice try
This ain't Half Baked
I ain't Mr. Nice Guy
My trigger finger's itchy
I think I'm gonna blast
Shoot first ask questions last

[Chorus: B-Real and (Celph Titled)]
Shoot first, ask questions last
(Shot gun pump bring a blast from the past)
Shoot first, ask questions last
(You better run fast, motherfucker run fast)
Shoot first, ask questions last
(Got a nine in the waist, .45 in the stash)
Shoot first, ask questions last
(You better run fast, motherfucker run fast)

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
Yes sir, I'm back y'all
Let the ratchet attack y'all
Put some dimples in ya face like a Cabbage Patch doll
Nobody ill as this
I let the bullets talk for me, I'm a ventriloquist
Chase you on the highway with weapons and
That hard stare you had before will turn to panic lookin' for the exit ramp
I'm all of that, and a plate full of pork chops
No morals, I'll turn a day care, into a dope spot
Demigodzilla, my outer shell got special scales
Measure my weight like Killer Whales (You need a special scale)
I get it poppin' fam, take you the promise land
Submerge you under water, couldn't live if you was Aquaman
Bonkers with the barnacles and sharp articles
Skim you limb to limb, down until you're bone particles
Comic illustrators
Wanna illustrate us
But ain't enough space to draw my gun in 30 pages
Ahh

[Chorus: B-Real and (Celph Titled)]
Shoot first, ask questions last
(Shot gun pump bring a blast from the past)
Shoot first, ask questions last
(You better run fast, motherfucker run fast)
Shoot first, ask questions last
(Got a nine in the waist, .45 in the stash)
Shoot first, ask questions last
(You better run fast, motherfucker run fast)
