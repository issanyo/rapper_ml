You are listening to the sound of music
Symbolic and complex rhythms

(Verse 1 - Big Oak)
In my '99 Saturn, switchin four lanes
Nah, fuck it, I'm gettin sick of rollin', and I'm ?
So I dumped in a ditch, got a truck with leather
Figured out why I've been feelin' under the weather
Rolled around for three years with a broken tape deck
Bumpin commercial radio, it made me sick
I got used to it man, it that made me sick
Got it fixed, but some underground, it made me sick!
So now I only listen to shit, that's good for my health
Like styles of beyond, Apathy and Celph
4-zone, Sandman, JaySon plus Jay-Z, anything old and rock n' roll
Feelin too old, from bein twenty-two
Gettin' nostalgic with songs like my dad used to do
It's pathetic, but I don't mean to start a revolution
I'm just makin music, makin my contribution

(Verse 2 - Celph Titled)
I was deep in the lab, cookin up some gourmet rap shit
At the chrome depot, where we lay the tracks with
Bangin' beats, we masters of the sample surgery
With rhymes so dope they have to be heard hypodermically
All over the world I'm famous for instrumental treats
But really I'm just a rapper that decided to make some beats
Don't ever call me a producer on the mic
I'm an mc behind the ?voice? you'd better get it right
And nigga's around my way be knowin' me for havin mad quotes
But I find it funny cause punch lines are just bad jokes
I'm a monster in this industry, who stays ?scheming?
On Halloween I dress like a human being
I make the type of music you could nod your head to
Entire albums you could play 'till the cassette's threw
I talk a lot of thug shit in these rap songs
But that's what happens when you put a raw nigga's track on

(Chorus)
We're making music, you'd better learn how to use it
You got the skills, better step up and prove it
If you got a title, pretty soon your going to lose it
Cause the L is here to stay, okay?

We're makin' music, not that underground trash
That floods the record racks and makes no impact
All-right, okay, they can't take all the blame
But it's not us, we're just here to save the day

(Verse 3 - Nick Fury)
Yo
We're makin' music while you write that abstract crap
Talkin' bout the periodic table in a rap
C'mon, what the fuck are ya'll doin'?
You'd better go back and listen to some ?"juice crew"? and
Understand that no one wants to hear that bullshit
Silly verse about your lyrical science experiment (nope)
Save it for your little internet geek sessions
With your beats that will cure insomnia in seconds
See while ya pack forty words in a bar and think
We pack forty girls in a bar and drink
Cause it's like that
The distortion off the ?? and demigodz are here to strike back
I'm somewhere in-between stunts, bloods and hip hop
And sex, drugs and rock n' roll, now that's music
I've got my word and I'm not afraid to use it
The hell with rap, I'ma sing the blues kid

(Verse 4 - Apathy)
I'm tryin' ta make joints 'till it gets played by Flex and Angie
And you can hear it comin' out of Ap's Lex or Camry
Fuckin' groupies until I only smell sex and candy
And if the girls don't jock I keep my ex's handy
I'll be rappin' 'till my little kids are playin' candy land
And I'm a family man, with ? seats inside a family van
I'll be changin their diapers, while I'm hangin' in ciphers
And hit you with their shitty drawers if your raps ain't tighter
I'm a demigod, you motherfuckers don't know the half
About this white boy speakin' five percent of math
With polo's to ? and hoes I mack easily
Control their sub-conscious with subliminal frequencies
Fuck young chicks, visiting dorm's too frequently
They don't blow up my spot, they're all sworn to secrecy
They stay on the dick, when chicks hear my new shit
And even keep a box of toothpicks to pick the pubics
It's music

(Chorus)
We're making music, you'd better learn how to use it
You got the skills, better step up and prove it
If you got a title, pretty soon your going to lose it
Cause the Ap and Celph is here to stay, okay?

We're makin' music, not that underground trash
That floods the record racks and makes no impact
All-right, okay, they can't take all the blame
But it's not us, we're just here to save the day
