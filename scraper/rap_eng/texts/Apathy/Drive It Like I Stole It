[Verse One]
I know it turns you on when I bury the needle
Got your hands on your face, and you're scared to peek through
But that speed does something to your body that excites you
The NOS gets you off, the nitrous ignites you
There's lights in my rear view, and streets I steer through
With woofers up so loud, what? I can't hear you
Lets skip the chit chat, shut up and sit back
I'm a teach you how to drive stick, now grip that
Amateurs hit the do', can't get it if you slow
Why I need a chick who can't handle it like a pro
Workin those curves that can flip my whip
Grip them hips like my tires grip the strip
You hear my speakers pump, makin you scream when I beat it up
I got your engine revin just to heat it up
Hit it fast till whiplash affects your neck
This ain't bout racin it's all bout um um

[Hook] {X2}
I know you want to hold it, but its hard to control it
I drive it like I stole it, drive it I stole it
I push it till I roll it, and somebody gotta tow it
I drive it like I stole it, drive it I stole it

[Verse Two]
I give gas to the ass and spin it around
And the centrifugal force is pinnin you down
A lot of these broads are brainless, barely an acquaintance
Who'll probably give me brains if I pull up in a vanquish
Advanced and tricked out when I pull the whip out my garage
She's like oh my gosh and flipped out
Gettin' out calm, activate the alarm
Pimped out, incognito, and tinted out
A superstar in the car, people tryin to figure out
Got you in the back seat, make it rock, two shocks squeak
We'll freak in the parking lot, spot two cops creep
If you wanna ride, I wanna know how it feel inside
Rotate the bass so you feel it side to side
Shift into fifth, so she quickly reached down
She needs more speed now

[Hook]
