[Verse 1]
I master my steez, disaterous to wacker MC's
Attacking with ease, and bring a bat to shatter your knees
I'm badder than these...
Rappers screaming, "Apathy please, show mercy"
But their begging doesn't matter to me
I'm allergic to wacker rappers, and automaticaly sneeze
So when they rap after me, I try not to breathe
Blow flows into tissue like boogies and snots
Cock the hammer, pop the Glock like a rookiesh cop
And when bitches see me rock, their pussy gets hot
Got 'em counting down the days that it took me to drop
And when the records in the store, you'll be begging for more
Cause you never heard a style like this perfected before
From the surface of the Earth to the center of the core
Epidermis of a girl or placenta of a whore
All the verses in the World couldn't settle the score
Cause Apathetic is the master of the deepest metaphors

[Verse 2]
I'll snatch your link, just to make you think
I draw gats quicker than the human optical blinks
Have you terrified, washing your sweaty face in a sink
Cause you pussy like a porn star dressed in pink
I'm on the brink of blowing to being thrown in the clink
Cause I start fights with cats like my shit don't stink
You think you gigantic, but you Titanic sink
I'm dynamic with ink, making larger heads shrink
I don't rock ice, don't even like ice in drinks
Go south for the winter, too hot for ice rinks
You flow soft, knock your nose off like the Sphinx
Hit hoes off, that's why your girls see's me and winks
I'm the sleeziest rap fink, Hip-Hop's Larry Flynnt
Hard to see like black tints, cats squint to glimpse
Never leave hints, photos, or finger prints
I'm down low, below underground macs and pimps
You new jack's and whimps, try hard, but cum limp
While my name is getting print across billboards and blimps
Ap Bar-B-Ques you shrimps, leaving my imprints
An inch in your skull before you could even flinch
Battle me, step up and die
So let me clarify, that I terrify
Paralyze, while you sit there and cry
I never lie, verify
I travel without moving like Ap was Jamiroquai
