The world is a vampire

[Verse 1:Apathy]
Swag is for fags,cray sound gay
I'm truly stuck in my ways but Ap’s here to stay
All rappers act pussy need a pap smear today
Get a axe to the face rap acts get away
Stumble acts and I'm swayze, gas mask on my face
Find a Pastor and pray it's the last of your days
Get pussy stay paid with them rats in a maze
With conditionin' >father say..ticklin graze ❓❓❓❓❓<
See the fast food craze put us in an early grave
9/11 was a joke just ask Flava Flav
I'm the Master and slave both at the same time
Insane in the mind since my brain was designed
By species who put out cassetes before CDs
And came to this earth like E.T I'm creepy
Perverted inserted semen inside the womb of Mary
Immaculate conception got a weapon that I carry
I wanna lady with the titties like Katy Perry
I wanna cementary where I bury ladies I marry
The more the merrier, move fast shatter the sound barrier
Deploy marines, submarines and aircraft carriers
I'm the scariest materialized before a haters eyes
And any biter who plagiarise gets vaporized
I'm a guillotine all I do is get head
I'll leave you dizead (dead) like fat kids in Phys Ed

[Refrain]
2x Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage!!

[Verse 2:Motive]
Ayyo It's Motive but they call me straight fire when I bear mics
Plus I'm known to stay higher than an airstrike
But on the low I move that shit to keep your nose runnin'
The Weatherman I let you know when that snow comin'
Fuck with my bread by any means I'll handle you
Take shots and i don't talk with no camera, dude
Break the cage I'm a Cannibal-animal
So hot you'll stay away from anything flammable
Alotta cats start to sound like Nick Cannon do
The God here is all year - annual
I live life like any day I could be killed
My verse short but mad ugly like Bushwick Bill
A hard rock that rob your watch just to buy time
They mad I got my jewels with the heat like Bron Bron
When I'm on the mic you could feel the hunger strike
Dopest Alive think otherwise then fuck your life
The shit I say I got 'em hate on my cocky ass
They shook like I'm from Crystal lake with a hockey mask
We hear you fags frontin' not the the cat to be fucked with
I'll catch you yappin' or somethin', I'm smashin' your pumpkin
I'm D.R so I doe rake, Never catch me with no cake
Even in summer shoveling snowflakes
Back in the days found me packin' the gauge
Fly as a bat in a cage y'all just rats in a cage

[Refrain]
