[Bridge]
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew (yeah)
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew (yeah)
Pe- Pete Rock, this one- Rock, this one's for the

[Verse 1: Apathy]
The verbal illustrator, nobody's skill is greater
I'll kill a hater, rip 'em up in a gorilla nature (uh)
Still a major threat suicide facilitator
Nobody iller or greater of the vanilla flavor (aw yea)
Resurrection of rap, the rehabilitator
I'll spit a verse that'll hit the earth and drill a crater (come on)
Miles deep, styles seep into the core
Competition want me dead, so I'm sleepin' on the floor (uh)
This is deeper than before, creature feature with gore
Defeat ya like you invited the Grim Reaper to war
I'm more than vicious (that's right)
Swear the fuck to god, I be warnin' bitches
You get mornin' sickness, you leavin' with abortion stitches
It'll take a forklift to lift this organ
If this whore could fit it deeper in her butt than in the porno business
Whether you powder sniffers or got a mouth full of Guinness (uh)
You better bow to this like I'm livin' on Mount Olympus (yo)

[Chorus]
I keep on for the fans of the realness
Throw up your hands in the air if you feel this
I keep on to maintain tradition
The same, never change as long as they stay listenin'

[Bridge]
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew (yeah)
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew (it's like that)
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]
Let me be totally honest
You wanna know what made me demonic?
I made it through Reaganomics for delf... glistenin' (uh)
With a pistol to my head listenin' to the Delfonics
Giuliani shipped men to the pen, felt infinite
But I embrace the ballpoint pen to write sentences (yea)
You smell me, you understand the scent this is?
Peep the pen... (uh) man... shhhhip... life sentences (come on)
Pharoahe and Apathy's like a virus, McAfee
Attackin' your faculty, back to back, decapitatin' you gradually
(uh huh)
Actually I'm a rappin' fanatic slash mathematician
With a chronic lung condition, when I breathe
You would never believe he's asthmatic (yea)
Fuck it, I'm stuck inside the 90s, still got Pirelli's
Rocked with 2Pac in the bay, not a lot you can tell me
Cock the snub nose put it in your mouth like Akinyele (yo)

[Chorus]
I keep on for the fans of the realness
Throw up your hands in the air if you feel this
I keep on to maintain tradition
The same never change as long as they stay listenin'

[Bridge]
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew (uh)
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew (yeah)
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew
Pete Rock, this- Rock- Rock- Rock, this one's for the

[Verse 3: Apathy]
For them bitches backstage pullin' boobs from bras
The applause from the fans and the oohs and ahhs (uh)
For the morons who think I won't bruise their jaws
We got machetes on deck and Freddy Krueger claws (come one, come on)
Bombs strapped and attached to your fuselage
We used to rob before this little music job
For the Pharaoh fanatics from Philly to France
Females with fat asses who fill up their pants (uh, yea)

[Verse 4: Pharoahe Monch]
From Philly to France we feelin' it, they fill up their pants
B-boy stance and chill in it, I'm still in advance
Lyricist that seal it with syllables that kill with a glance (uh)
With the Magilla Gorilla glue and the pen when I chant (whoo)
Militant... Muhammad, The Thrilla In Manila when I vomit
A jagged little pill, isn't it ironic? (come on)
You little maggot, I'm ill, the Protagonist
The bionic Pharoahe Monch - the iconic (yo)

[Chorus]
I keep on for the fans of the realness
Throw up your hands in the air if you feel this
I keep on to maintain tradition
The same never change as long as they stay listenin'

[Bridge]
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew (yeah)
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew (yeah)
Pete Rock, this one- Rock, this one's for the

[Outro: Pharoahe Monch]
Apathy, Pharoahe Monch, King R
Peace and we out
