[Intro]
He say, she say
He say, she say
He say, she say
He say, she say

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Whatever happened to Kim, that girl your sister was cool with?
A couple years younger but we went to high school with
I heard that she was strippin', gettin' dollars on stage
And she got some dirty pictures on her Myspace page
Don't she date Dirty Darrel who's addicted to blow?
No one thought she'd be with him but I predicted it though
Supposedly his older brother used to fuck with Kim's mother
'Cause she like her lovers much much younger
Even though it sounds so absurd
I don't know if it's true, it's just what I heard
'Cause she told him, told his ex bird
That you know who did this, that and a third (word?)
Even though it sounds so suspicious
I know some bitches that know his sisters
Rumors spread quick like some kind of sickness
I think everybody need to mind they business with that
He say, she say
He say, she say
He say, she say

[Chorus: Chip Fu]
Oh no
Who do that and who do this?
I don't know but remember this
Keep your nose out my business
Keep your nose out my business
Who did that? Who did this?
I don't know but remember this
Keep your nose out my business
Keep your nose out my business

[Verse 2: Apathy]
All 'round town things are goin' around
And they all heard rumors and I don't know how, but
Every little thing I do they know now
I just can't seem to figure it out, but
They can't keep my name out they mouth and
Everything little thing I do they talk 'bout

He say, she say
He say, she say
He say, she say
He say, she say

[Chorus: Chip Fu]
Who do that, who do this?
Remember this
Business
Business
Who did that? Who did this?
Remember this
Business
Business
