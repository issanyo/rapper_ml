[Intro]
L.A., L.A., that's where I stay
And I ride of them thangs like everyday
Totally awesome, okay?
And if you don't believe me come around my way
(Standing on this mountain
Looking over L.A
At the break of day)
(Outta Cali with a bang, bitch! Fuckin' insane, bitch!
The man savin' L.A.)
(L.A.)
(Savin' L.A
Outta Cali with a bang, bitch! Fuckin' insane, bitch!)

[Verse 1: Ryu]
Yo, the man savin' L.A
I rock the California State flag over my face
8-1-8 takin' over, gotta notice the flow, brah
I caught a little break with Shinoda and Hova
Put out the mixtape with Green Lantern with smash hits
The song I did with Juelz Santana was bat shit
Fact is, I'm nasty
In need of a sponge bath
I make you make a face like you sniffin' a skunk's ass
Mash out
Motherfuckers better know the program pronto
I'll kill your boss soft, make your capo compost
Dudes, wanna fuck around?
Fine, I'm chillin'
You may have a couple nines, but I got a few kagillion
It's sad lavish
After mathematics, uh!
In the home of fine wine and cash addicts
You want static, you can handle it simple
A couple batteries and jumper cables hooked to your nipples
I'm from...

[Hook]
L.A., L.A., that's where I stay
And we ride of them things like everyday
(L.A.)
Totally awesome, okay?
So if you don't believe me come around my way
(Around my way)
(Outta Cali with a bang, bitch! Fuckin' insane, bitch!
The man savin' L.A)
So watch what you say
(Savin' L.A.)
I'm here to save the day
(Outta Cali with a bang, bitch! Fuckin' insane, bitch!)
(I get it, baby!)

[Verse 2: Bishop Lamont]
Is it... L.A. or is it Entourage?
Actors actin' like gangstas, rappers wrapped up in fa√ßades
Stuck up models and broads, stuck on Hollywood's mirage
Stickin' fingers down they throats tryin' to keep a model's size
Sunshine
This is where the ballers live
But hit my side of town, this is where they'll rob you quick
Carson, Cali
You can take the 110 to the 91 East, and hop off on Wilmington
Compton's next door
Long Beach on the other side
Harbor City, San Pedro
Extra five minute ride
Peace to my Mexicans, Samoans, Cambodians, Asians
Even a few white boys in the hood hayin'
Blowin' kush, ridin' Chargers and Harleys
Do we got love for the police?
Naw, not hardly
This the west coast, more than low-lows and gang bangin'
My city got the whole world imitatin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tak]
Rollin' through Laurel Canyon and my home in Los Angeles
Listenin' to this song I did before I was on the cannibis
Make a right off of Crescent Heights and blockin' up my speed
Cause Cheapshot's spinnin' right on top of the Roxy
Yep, yep, phenomenal
Tak done got a street buzz
Shots in the abdominal, rendez-vous at the Key Club
Once I get a cutie I would like to spoon
I move her right across the street into the Viper Room
Shit
They know my face in over half of the globe
That's why I'm still up in the place drinkin' after they close
Once I got a little itch for some bucks to spend
I take a trip to Los Feliz, hit the Rustic Inn
(L.A.)
Yeah and I ain't quittin', I'm sippin' on hell's fire
Once the mission is finished we dippin' to Mel's Diner
Check my wristwatch: it's a quarter to five
And hit the last pit stop, baby, right off of Highland
In...

[Hook]

(L.A.)
