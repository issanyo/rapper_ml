[Intro: Clip from Lady In The Water]
I tried to tell them about you, I don’t know if I did the right thing. I don’t know how they’re gonna react

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Keep the money coming, keep it so filthy
Keep your brain greedy, that’s how this world built me
Picture Genghis Khan, picture Megatron
Now picture BP, picture Exxon
Picture presidents, dead ones, alive ones
Black ones, white ones, devils in their eyes ones
Picture priests, picture the preacher, picture the prophet
Picture popes, picture police with padded pockets
Picture parents in a picture-perfect town with a pinch of pedophilia that tends to sneak around
Think of politicians, they making a killing
And then they wanna turn around and call me a villain?
Picture devils and demons with disguises
Smiling with eyes tatted on their closed eyelids
Picture handshakes that most never notice
The picture’s always been there, it’s simply how you focus

[Verse 2: Apathy]
This ain’t trap music, this ain’t frat music
It’s moshpit shit, get your skull cracked to it
This ain’t devil music, it’s just the study of
It ain’t the murder weapon but it’s the bloody glove
This is the thesis to show you who the beast is
The propaganda professors would never teach this
Picture people that will profit off religion
Now picture physicians who profit off certain prescriptions
Picture principals, parent-teacher conference
ADHD and all that other nonsense
Psychologists will talk us out of all wisdom
While vaccine shots give children autism
Our community leaders mislead us
With laws that’ll take away our 9mm's
Picture men who’ll say that they speak for Jesus
I’ll believe that shit when Hell freezes

[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
Lifers in the booth, snipers on the roof
Picture military personnel that like to shoot
Picture heroism, fill out your application
Picture terrorism, picture assassination
Picture pistols that pop instantly
Picture silencers that muffle the sound of gunshots efficiently
They say a picture’s worth a thousand words
Now picture a thousand pictures of a mushroom cloud about to burst
Picture cloudy skies on the day that Howie died
Picture metal detectors inside Canarsie High
Picture a newborn baby with the gas mask
Picture a New York skyscraper avalanche
A cameraman is kidnapped by the Taliban
Decapitated they sent his head into Pakistan
Picture the gruesome Twit videos and pics
Picture triple-six, picture the villain that live within
