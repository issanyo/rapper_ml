[Hook] [Kappa Gamma]
Fancy cars and fancy clothes I really like the way that sounds
That's not greed, just what I need
Money makes the world go round

[Verse 1] [Apathy]
Ayo
Here's a little ditty about Jack and Diane, nah
Here's a little ditty about crack in my hand, nah
Here's a little warning, I'm transforming
Absorbing the light from the full moon and I'm human the next morning
I'm storming your base, like a Stormtrooper in space
I want the riches, the bitches and the code to the safe
I want the paper with the eye in the pyramid
9/11 the pyramid when it gets folded like origami
I'm serious, mysterious, I've studied this bloody money like periods
For strippers with the tips that are stuffed in their private areas
Gentlemen junkies hooked on adrenaline
Audi engine revving and reverends behaving feminine
It's funny what this money can do to the average person
Like purse snatching and stabbing and stacking paper for purchasing
High-end fashion, escort action
Checks start cashing and watch what happens

[Hook] [Kappa Gamma]
Fancy cars and fancy clothes I really like the way that sounds
That's not greed, but what I need
Money makes the world go round

[Verse 2] [Hayze]
You know you gotta sin first in order to repent
Well shit, my rents due by the time I try and cut my expenses
But I guess it's in my genetics to spend
Ree up and do the same shit again, I'm relentless
Penthouse view, bitches in the G-ride
Fuel the situation, never been to Seaside
Ghoul with me baby, you know that we creeps right?
See a pack of extravagant savages when we ride
Need my dollars and product to keep it flipping
Got a vision of Prada linen and designer dishes
But wishes never fuel quote it's only fueled bitching
That being-broke shit I ain't with it
Like the world would stop spinning on its axis if cash didn't exist
I'm dashing for a stack of Benjamins
Dividends so I gotta grind
I'm made up of ions, neutrons, protons, dollar signs

[Hook] [Kappa Gamma]
Fancy cars and fancy clothes I really like the way that sounds
That's not greed, just what I need
Money makes the world go round
Fancy cars and fancy clothes I really like the way that sounds
That's not greed, but what I need
Money makes the world go round
