[Verse 1: Apathy]
A mass murderer, black magic practitioner
Ap is the rap listener's crack distributor
A wizard with wise words
Magician with fly birds
I'll saw a bitch in half, if she's getting on my nerves
So observe the dirty, rotten, son of a cesspool
I piss plutonium and my heart pumps jet fuel
Too cool for school, shoot it up like Virginia Tech
Unless police intercept my plots on the Internet
That last line was fucked up, so homie don't laugh
I'm cold blooded, apathetic as a sociopath
A lot of jealous motherfuckers like, "I hope he don't last"
I'm in Japan counting Yen, doing Tokyo math
My shit's crack, spit raps, and you swear you got bitch slapped
Big Mike sell my shit, til it's platinum on mixed rap
I'll push ya whole clique back, with one little click-clack
If we abduct ya grandmom, is that still kidnap?
You talk about ya llamas, and ya strapped with the gat cocked
The only time you ever held a Mac was a laptop
I stay around weed heads who constantly hit blunts
And burn it down more than bitches during the Witch Hunts
Instead of dropping classics and making sure shit pumps
You drop a bullshit mixtape every 6 months
The force of my flow's strong, hard as a photon
The rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on

[Interlude]
And on and on and on, it don't stop
Demigodz squad always gon' be at the top
Shoutout to Open Mic, Steve Cormier, John Childs aka Voodoo, Derrick Marsh, Yeah

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Old school got my Raiders cap
Nothing you could say to Ap
Sadomasochistic, it hurts how hot I make the track
Kneel down and praise the king
A demon with angel wings
Tattoo my flesh with ink and scorpion stings
I'm trying to get it through ya head
You could fill me up with lead
I'll chill in heaven half an hour before the Devil knows I'm dead
Send out the memo, I been killing it since my demo
The fact that I'm a Demigod is not coincidental
Half human, half almighty
Kicks are all Nike's
I'm not the one to fuck with, if you want, pshh alrighty
Here it goes, melting sub woofers in ya stereos
A dungeon dragon like Busta Rhymes on Scenario
Off the top, motherfuckers better call the cops
I'll come through like Sasquatch and squash ya blocks
I block telepathic thoughts when they try to read my mind
The way I rhyme "rap" just got re-defined
Whenever I tear the mic
It's easy as Eric Wright
Ya feeding on my paragraphs, you rappers are parasites
I'm paralyzing crowds, y'all are typing like paralegals
Rolling like Noah in a boat with a pair of eagles
Demigodz a pack of pits, y'all are a pair of beagles
I'll beat ya bitches beaver up, though the ho's barely legal
I rep DGZ down to my last proton
The rhyme get's rougher, as the rhyme goes on

[Interlude]
A demigod is a half-human, half-god
We got that name because back in 1992, Open Mic said this line right here in one of his rhymes

[Hook x2: Apathy]
It's the land of the rhymes, and I'm a Demigod
Land of the rhymes, and I'm a Demigod
Land of the rhymes, and I'm a Demigod
I'm Zeus in the booth, spitting lightening rods

[Outro]
Motherfucker
Shoutout to everybody who's been there since the beginning
Dwayne Anderson, Louie Montalvo, Spliffmatic, Tony Louscher
It's the mayday, DJ E-LO, Tito and Quran, Naptron, Eternia, K-Squared, White Harlem, a lot of people I'm forgettin'
Yeah, Demigodz
Album is on its way right now
Demigodz is back
Yeah, Apathy, Teddy Roxpin
