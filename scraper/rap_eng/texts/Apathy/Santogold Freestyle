[Santogold]:
When they kick out your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun?

[Apathy]:
I'm a killer off the top this is not a drill
Simply just a lot of skill
Keep it moving, never time to stop and chill
Pop a pill, down a drink
When your brain is out of sync
Study one of Ap's raps, it's teach you how to think
Perculate your brain waves
Circulate your blood flow
I am Titantic, you're a bunch of little tug boats
But I never sink, navagate away from ice
Ap will find the most percise savage way to slay the mic
Cause I stay up late at night in the labratory
You could never out perform me
End of story, dopest in my category
Rappers wanna work with me?
Haha you probably can't afford me
You are way too young and it would kinda feel like statutory
Acting corny, sweating me until there is no more sweat in me
And if I, drip dry, you would just think less of me
So
I keep my flow fluent, fluid flowing
This is not a fluke, you would puke trying to do the shit I'm doing
I could ruin rappers, chew and crap you out into the sewer
Ap's mental like a Pentium, there ain't a new computer faster
Take a second with it
I take a minute with it
Quit it cause you'll never get it
It'll stretch your little fitted
Blow your head apart, head to toe
Freeze ya like an eskimo
Write a suicide letter, sign it with an X and O
Sorry that I have no sentimental abilities
I'm just nuts so put me in the mental facility

[Santogold]:
When they kick out your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun?
When the law break in
How you gonna go?
Shot down on the pavement
Or waiting in death row?
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brooklyn
The money feels good
And your life, you like it well
But surely your time will come
As in heaven, as in hell
