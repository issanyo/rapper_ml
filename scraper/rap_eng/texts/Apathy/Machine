[Intro: Blacastan]
Hahaha
Robotech shit
The man in the machine
Watson & Holmes
Study, study

[Verse 1: Blacastan]
Murder for capital off in the surf in the capsule
Cracked the ground releasing the hellhounds
Trapped behind words like K-Solo, I'm Spellbound
I'm released when the rhymes deceased
Newborns being born with the mark of the beast
In the new world, zombies is walking the streets
Feasting on flesh, fresh blood drip from they teeth
In a state of war, peace has escaped already
Cause violence is flooded like breaching a levee
The messiah at a podium, I preach with a machete
God flow steady, my medley is deadly
I'm trying to change the world when your outlook is petty
We gotta be more than chasing bitches and fetti
We trapped in a war with a machine and we, it's heavy
And now more than ever, the future is sketchy
The time is now, my nigga is you ready?

[Hook: Blacastan]
We all trapped in the machine till the end of time
You gotta get yours before I gotta get mines
Beyond the front lines in these ominous times
My rhyming is the key to unlock your mind

[Verse 2: Blacastan & Apathy]
I'm riding on a ninja bike riding through electrical mazes
Automatic assault rifles and blue lasers
Word to God, fight hard in this modern jihad
Bags of dope, getting blown on the boulevard
Pull your card, leave a schoolyard bully scarred
You front Muslim when you're eating food full of lard
Oh my Lord, leg and limb amputator
Killing like Reggie Miller as an Indiana Pacer
Lift words off the paper like a Disney animator
Labeled dunce in the corner
Wizard hat like Fantasia
Vibrantly, my virus spread through Malaysia
Silence Miley Cyrus with a euthanasia
Stupid humans, you can assume your lasers
Mean doom for Earthlings, but I'm your Savior
Rhyme Vader invading no mic, a lightsaber
Save your Carl Sagan facts, Ap is greater

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Apathy]
I'm dumber than the dumbest
A demon dumping and bucking
A bunch of bullets are stuck and the TEC is steadily stuttering
Bludgeoning, blood gushing and sputtering
Cops cluttering, gutters what God's summoning
Angels will start fluttering, heart fluttering
You don't got the heart to start hustling
Park the park, crack pipes, walking the dog
I stay sharp to the socks
I'm Clark Kent in suede Clarks
Y'all are Clay Aiken in Crocs in a K-Mart
Box on the shoulder
Megawatts hot enough to smoke the circuits in the radio
Hot as a supernova, know the ledge
Hoes' legs spread quicker than Cobra heads
Cocoa Cabana nose to the coke till the coke is red
Everything coke aesthetic, the dopest and don't forget it
It's Blac and Ap in the Ac' with a kidnapped bitch in the back
And a package of plastic package wrapped in elastic
Demigod with a semi auto, plus the automatics

[Hook]
