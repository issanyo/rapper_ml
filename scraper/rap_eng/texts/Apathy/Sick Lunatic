I be the sick lunatic with the devilish poem
From the mist of the darkness, I come with this
I be the sick lunatic with the devilish poem
From the mist of the darkness, I come with this

[Verse 1: Apathy]
This is my theme music, devils go to sleep and have dreams to it
A green fluid that leaks in your brain like the beat's sewage
The newest ninja turtle, my verbals are like crop circles
The language of an alien life form who cops purple
The perfect flow, pocket like a pilot in a cockpit
Whose firing rockets of violent, offing some pilin
Hostages bodies and homemade coffins, I got a vile of toxins
Send you flying through the air like Mary Poppins
Y'all are barely popping, I'm a grizzly bear chomping
Through your epidermis, F your workers, effortless verses
Ap is perfect, overload the circuits in your iPhone
The Silver Surfer, murder every universe where I roam
The rose colored, blood flooded rooms like Redrum
My flow's novocane, blow your brain, leave your head numb
The psychopathic, writing magic words like holy Shaman
I leave your homie watching while I throw you in a coffin

[Verse 2: Apathy]
I shit out shitters, shake Richters and ricochet
Bullets that'll have you stepping quicker than Kid 'n Play
My missiles slay little gay rappers who exist today
Fist'll rock, pistol pop, darkness will eclipse your block
Bitches stop dead in they tracks to go and get a cop
Get a job, get involved, fuck with me and get dissolved
Problem solved, gun revolved, caveman who can't evolve
Molotov cocktails, burnin' servants of the cloth
Back 'em off, blast 'em off, deep as Isaac Asimov
Kalashnikov, Ap is off meds, takin' off your heads
Shatter backs like Shaq backboards in basketball
Scatter brain, addict of Ativan and Adderall
Add 'em up, body count shows that I'm bad as fuck
A Baseball Furie in battle yellin', "Batter up"
A bitter cynic, spit acidic verses that'll hit a critic
Harder than Riddick did it, admit it, y'all are on the di-dick
