[Scratching]
"Get down to this funky sound"
"Come on y'all"
"Don't stop"

[Verse 1: Anti Citizens]
Listen, this is operation Wake The Fuck Up
You in the cut pan handling with a pimp cup
Give you a razor blade you still can't make the cut
Take a queue from Pharaohe Monch and get the fuck up
Then get sued from the loop, give your chops up
50 G retainer fee with no luck
Yo, I gotta tell you the truth
The only easy part is being in the vocal booth

And this the beautiful music, we give it to you to prove
That if this movement is damned then this is apparently the viewing
It's a combination of just straight passion and dedication
And we use it to defibrillate this hip hop nation

And if you find it difficult to drop incredible heat
Then you should not be dropping records in the city where I sleep
Take an Ambien and go back to being a fan G
And let us do this hip hop so effortlessly

[Hook: Apathy] {x2}
I ain't stressing MC's
Why you effing with me?
Man I do this rap shit so effortlessly
So effortlessly, so effortlessly
Man I do this rap shit so effortlessly

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
I was easy going
Not knowing how much Weezy flowing
How much that greed be growing
They wanna see me hoeing
I feel like Jeezy doeing
So it's not a show until I get the doe
And if not, I pull a Donald Goines
I get a lot of that
Hate greenbacks
I don't sing, don't dance, don't even Lean Back
I just regime tracks
I mean I fuck beats
(From time to time)
Disrespect the race like Buckwheat
Act [?] do some ignorant shit till the cops cuff me
Pull out a pen like it's tucked heat
Y'all cowards suck [?]
God MC, dollars need to start trusting  in me
Born to be a beautiful mind that's ugly to see
You try hard, still not fucking with me
In a hammock, Miami Beach stretching my feet
Finish my call and I do it all effortlessly

[Hook]
