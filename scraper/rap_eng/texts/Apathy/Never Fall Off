[Verse 1: Apathy]
The Babylon baby, walk amongst the lords and the ladies
Blood full of rabies, I’m straight outta Hades
Made from the elements of hatred, it’s evident
Raised in the era when Reagan was President
The mark of the beast, see 'em march through the streets
Bodyguards and police, body parts of deceased
Edit parts of their speech; get the hearts of the weak
Study cellphone records, credit cards and receipts
Ghost nation, zombies who love to watch zombies
Governments who emulate Nazis and Commies
Ponzi schemes, big dreams and dirty laundry
Cancer causin' chemicals are constantly on me
The food's full of poison the book's full of lies
Planes fly by leavin' trails in the skies
Eyes full of tears pour beers for they lives
I’m snatchin’ up capes every time a hero dies
Got that Summertime shine, New Era's and Air Max's
Money under the mattress, money hungry and Fascist
Muddy bloody with axes, sticky with blood of rappers
Wrapped up in bloody rags, Saran wraps and plastics
Blood plasma that's plastered and splattered, shattered and fractured
You maggots and scattered fragments all over your finer fabrics
I don’t believe in magic, only in mathematics
Bullets in automatics and medicine for these addicts

[Chorus:]
I make moves like a boss, never takin' a loss
We will never… fall… off
It’s a cold, cold world but my heart pumps frost
We will never… fall… off
I stay gettin' money, never rhyme soft
Middle finger in the air for suckers who fell off
I stay gettin' money, never rhyme soft
Middle finger in the air for suckers who fell off

[Verse 2: A.G.]
It’s A.G. and I was raised in the dirty
Named my son after the borough that birthed me
Named my daughter after the borough that birthed me
Mastered the music never studied at Berklee
Said it's your house but you never home
Said he fly, looks to me like you never flown
More powerful than crack, this shit is like adrenochrome
I bag it and push it like a Salt-N-Pepa song
Public Enemy, Welcome to the Terrordome
You shoulda known better, I’m just better known
God don’t fight for crowns and thrones
Casualty of war, he died on a metronome
Listen homie my shit is extra stone
To paraphrase it, I need to be left alone
Same home as Kris Parker
Andre's a warrior don’t confuse him with Iguodala
I’m legendary compare me to Chupacabra
Cherish the day, same shit I do tomorrow
I've seen glory, seen drama
Can't wait to reincarnate so I can see Arthur
P-80 to ya mind, you suffer glaucoma
Take one for the team; I killed him for the culture
Split your pumpkin and it’s not October
I will never fall, great like I’m supposed to

[Chorus:]
I make moves like a boss, never takin' a loss
We will never… fall… off
It’s a cold, cold world but my heart pumps frost
We will never… fall… off
I stay gettin' money, never rhyme soft
Middle finger in the air for suckers who fell off
I stay gettin' money, never rhyme soft
Middle finger in the air for suckers who fell off

[Outro:]
Never fallin', never fallin'
I ain’t never fell off
Never fallin', never fallin'
I ain’t never fell off
Never fallin', never fallin'
I ain’t never fell off
Never fallin', never fallin'
I ain’t never fell off
