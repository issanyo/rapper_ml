[Hook]
Out in the dark shaking hands in the street, I'm drifting
Drifting away from my family towards my foes
My mother told me, "You'll reap what you sow
What you most want is bad for you, you know'"

[Verse 1]
The summer's dead and the winter just woke up
Gotta quit drinkin' I'm sick of the smell of throw up
No fucks are given, I'm livin' where people roll up
Weed like it's a competition where someone can blow up
Made with precision like laser guided robotic arms
Till they spotted moms, but fuck it only a false alarm
Phew
This used to be a teenage wasteland
With broken turntables and hundreds of empty spray cans
Bitches everywhere, son I swear to God
If you ain't gettin' head at least it's a hand job
Motherfucker get a job or should I jog your memory
Bitches with dumb bums date your worst enemy
It's like they're allergic to failure
Even average hoes try to dress like Iggy Azalea
What's this world coming to? I ponder
There's no respect or honor in driving a Honda
Or having a baby mama or medical marijuana
Cards, ain't living large they going straight to the farmer
I'm staying on point like an archer
Just flash back to mama and the shit that she taught ya

[Hook]
