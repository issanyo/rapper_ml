[Intro: Apathy]
Apathy.  Atlantic Records.  That's what works, baby.  You ready to do it?  (Yeah.  What?) Let's go (Yeah.  Yo)

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I'm old school like analog opposed to Pro Tools
And blow through your whole crew like Triple-X when he hold tools
The intellect is so cool, I freeze the cerebellum
When I'm blowing air up in your melon, I'm compared to a felon
With an infallible flow.  Imagine me rapping like I want to hurt you
Worms’ll tunnel holes through your body, then push that dirt through
I'm Jesus with telekinesis.  I'm Moses, so focused
I’ll open up the oceans with basic human emotions
I ain't boasting.  I'm that bastard that bathes in battery acid
You making Apathy mad and you taken out in a bag
Zipped from your cranium to your ankles.  I studied the radius
And the angles to turn those who oppose into angels with halos
Guitars and harps, my bars are so sharp
Marine biologists study me instead of jaws of sharks
It's too deep.  A few sleep like we going to nuclear war
Put my CD on sale and see what it do to your store

[Outro: Apathy]
We show you how to do this, motherfuckers!
