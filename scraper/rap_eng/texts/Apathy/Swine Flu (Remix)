[Verse 1: Apathy]
Ey yo I'm Keeping out a trouble, keep the heater on humble
Got a box cutter hidden underneath my belt buckle
Melt metal into puddles like supernova's with space shuttles
A wicked wizard who loves evil and hate muggles
I use a Rambo knife to shave my face stubble
Never kept cassettes in the car in case the tape bubbles
First world troubles got duct tape if the bitch struggles
Get on top and exercise them hip muscles
Nowadays rap is more hipster than hip hop
Shit's pop, feminine as Penelope Pit stop
You bringing all of this androgynous fashion in
Puerto Rican lesbians be looking more masculine
Mask tape your face and slash ya skin
You glass chin motherfuckers get ya skulls bashed in
A never-ending story like Falkor and Bastion
But the nothing is the label and rappers who cashed in
Cash cow golden calf Moses holding his staff
Foes laugh til' they laying in forensic photographs
Know the wrath is like Cain when I'm attacking your brain
Extract plasma out the veins like it's Dracula fangs

[Verse 2]
Coke machine room cipher, murder rap for hire
Twenty five to lifer twenty five lighters on my dresser
Yes sir, I gots to get paid
Joe Pesci in goodfellas I gots to get made
And here comes Allen Iverson I gots to get braids
Riff-Raffish, cut the beard off and I'm still savage
You got a million songs out, you still average
I got three singles under me, they all classics
No catalog bitches still subscribe to 'em
Millionaire swagging and he ain't got a dime to 'em
Walked a good game ever since I was high schooling
Bring that 9:40 central standard time to 'em
Ten paces, turn around draw we high noonin'
John Wayne meets John Wayne Gacy
Could have finished that scheme, but I was feeling lazy
Fuck you, Pay me and all that good shit, motherfucker

[Hook]
Never kept cassettes in the car in case the tape bubbles
Now a days rap's more hipster than hip hop
Glass chin, motherfuckers get they skulls basked in
(Well) Skulls, skulls, skulls bashed in

[Verse 3 ]
Yow my blade's nice, pacing around the room like I ate too many fumes
Inhaling  great tasting fumes fluid, am Oral Donovan
Dead come August, flippin', Lucy O'Ball trip me swimming on your carpet
(Well) Target, walking around people watching they target
The power harness, me, I scout for the darkness
I'm Cali but I'm cool, I put Khaki on your booth
I de-spy you, you sick, spit swine flu
(Well) I'm Michael Scorn that's what birth madness
There ain't no standing, been killing shit, Heny Hernandez
Hope to bail, I think they just wake the giant
So good you wanna slap your mamma
There's riot, I think I personally keep my local liquor store in business
Allegedly, a lucid me, I intimidate the witness
Am self taught
This tight and this is not cool
I'm trying to burn a bag a shit at the corporate port to Fox news

[Hook]
Never kept cassettes in the car in case the tape bubbles
Now a days rap's more hipster than hip hop
Glass chin, motherfuckers get they skulls basked in
(Well) Skulls, skulls, skulls bashed in
(Well)
