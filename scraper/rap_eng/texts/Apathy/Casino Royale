[Verse 1: Apathy]
I'm only gettin' bigger and better
I'm like a bionic baboon who studies
The bloody victims are left with a stab wound
A Babylon baby my mother said I'm the evilest
'Cos even as a fetus they would feed us other fetuses
Foes never defeat us it's never a photo finish
I make green like foto-synthesis my dough replenishes
Overdose, comatose leave you with a broken nose
DemiGodzilla that's much bigger than Tokyo's
Okey doke, rope a dope, rappers get a broken throat
Float in the air like a wizard with a open cloak
Dress sharp suede Clarks, shoplift from K-Mart
The great white got nothing to do with great sharks
Y'all be yappin' but never ever destroyed a beat
You'se a bitch when you piss put down the toilet seat
I Eric vandalize Vanderslice van full of pack with Stu Bangas
Aim my hammer at the stranger

[Scratching]
"You said I wasn't ripping shit properly"
"Shut the fuck up"
"Demigodz"
"Ill in ways you can't vision"
"Stop trying to see where your eyes can't follow"

[Verse 2:Blacastan]
Ayyo I'm definitely defecatin' on
Wack niggas contemplatin' on
Makin' doper joints than the Demigodz
I'm in your yard watching you jog
Focus is scoping the fog
Then shoot a strap off your iPod
Now how's that for a cheat shot?
I never feel asleep ock
This beat got more subs than your >beat??< got
Uhhh, some kufi niggas Vlade Divac and pump Reebok
The fun stops when the pump pops
Dead your life to one shot, then I vanish off the block
The barrel's still hot, I ain't trying to get locked
Stack up them gold blocks like they do in Fort Knox
D.G.Z., Mount Olympus, Demigodz on top

[Scratching]
"You said I wasn't ripping shit properly"
"You crazy?"
"Demigodz"
"Ill in ways you can't vision"
"Stop trying to see where your eyes can't follow"
"It's like that"
"Cause I'm [?] boy you better believe it, word"
