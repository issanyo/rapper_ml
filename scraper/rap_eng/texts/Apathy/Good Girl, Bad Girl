[Hook]
Good girl yeah
I want a good girl
I want a bad girl
I want a smart chick
I want a dumb bitch
I want her real sweet
I want a real freak
I want a chick who keeps peace
And a bitch who beefs

[Hook]
I want a good girl
I want a bad girl
I want a smart chick
I want a dumb bitch
I want her real sweet
I want a real freak
I want a chick who keeps peace
And a bitch who beefs

[Verse 1]
I want a good girl, someone I could take home to mom
A bad girl low cut waist to show thongs
Smart chick to discuss life’s absurdities
Dumb bitch who don’t understand what the words people real sweet
Never really asking for shit
A freak who’s turned on when she gags on my dick
A chick who keeps peace mouth never runs off
But a bitch who still beefs if it ever jumps off
Well balanced it’s a challenge to discover them talents
A loud bitch who understands the value of silence
Don’t condone violence
Watch for lights and sirens
Cooks cleans and irons
Reads books on science
Freaky as foreign actresses
Passionate as activists
Not exactly pacifist but never scared to slap a bitch
Through joy and pain sunshine and rain
And if you still don’t get it
Let me explain

[Hook]
I want a good girl
I want a bad girl
I want a smart chick
I want a dumb bitch
I want her real sweet
I want a real freak
I want a chick who keeps peace
And a bitch who beefs
I want a good girl
I want a bad girl
I want a smart chick
I want a dumb bitch
I want her real sweet
I want a real freak
I want a chick who keeps peace
And a bitch who beefs
