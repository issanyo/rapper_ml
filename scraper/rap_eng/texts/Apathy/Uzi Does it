[Verse 1: Apathy]
Speaker beater
Tweeter eater
Trunk fucker upper
I eat beats up for supper

Sucker punch
Mothafuckas
This ain’t rap

[Verse 2: RYU]
Other other
Burning rubbers
Girl your mother
Would be sick and woozy
If she knew
I taught her
Little daughter how to grip an uzi
Easy easy
Chill chill
Chicken greazy
Finger licking
Freaky fucker
I eat beats up for supper
I eat beats up for suppah

I got that massive shit
Big old Iraq ass clips
I got a bad ass bitch
Open your trap and get
Laid out
Open your trap and get
Laid out

Yo my shit never jams
That’s my jam
Never jams
That’s my jam
Never jams
That’s my jam
Never jams

Yo my shit never jams
That’s my jam
