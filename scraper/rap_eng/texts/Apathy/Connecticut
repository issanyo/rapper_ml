[Verse 1]

I swear man, I’m gonna miss it when I leave, yo
The late night trips, I used to hit up the casinos
Foxwoods craps used to get me for my c-notes
Between that and tricking on them chicks from Willi-Rico
Toads Place shows where the sickest emcess flow
Out and pistol waving, New Haven, it’s all peace though
Gotta roll deep when you crossing over the borders
Heading out to Sin City, swimming in them dirty waters
All my Fairfield brothers, hustlers, down chicks
All my lesbians in Lebanon I hit the town with
I got women, I out in Clinton that discount my kicks
So to get an outfit I go and hit the outlets
I love my little ladies in the CT state
I had this bad shorty from the Heartbeat, she's straight
I met her at Hot Jam, she never heard my music
But seen my billboard along CT-8

(Hook)
Connecticut is the place to be
CT till I die, 86O, 203
Connecticut is the place to be
One time for the place to be
Connecticut is the place to be
Blue and White the Huskies, CT
Connecticut is the place to be
One time

[Verse 2]
Dead in the middle of Middletown
Embedded in Middletown, I met this little she fly
I got word that bands'll make her dance so we headed out to Stanford
Just to hit Alive at 5, hard hitting New Britain with them niggas that all clap
Mount Pleasant Hill, 7714 ...?
The place where you can’t take shots in the club
Less you tryna get shot in the club
But you don’t hear me, though
New London, Whaler prides what we call that, the hometown green an gold got our own ball caps
Getting hella paper, from Ocean Beach to the Crystal pissy elevators
The Gun Hill, Boulder drive, Elm Street players
The 187 where they push that montega
This is love state wide, let all of the hate die
Play this through your radio, get the whole state high
CT, what up?

(Hook)
Connecticut is the place to be
CT till I die, 86O, 203
Connecticut is the place to be
One time for the place to be
Connecticut is the place to be
Blue and White the Huskies, CT
Connecticut is the place to be
One time
