[Verse One: Celph Titled]
Hit the floor when you hear em blaze the carbon
Put in the best shape of your life, a round or rectangle coffin
Without a G pass you can be murdered
Cost you more than Yung Berg’s jewelery, insurance, you could be hurted
A lot of lames be con artists and shop lifters
It ain’t a game so my cartridge is filled with cop killers (wow)
Gun barrel longer than Yoshi’s tongue (it is)
Door knocker put a peephole through both your lungs (it did)
In a place where they package crack and meth up
So if you act aggressive don’t be shocked to see the flash suppressor
When the goons is in true form they shoot more
Leave so many holes in ya the doctor’s like "Ain’t nothing we can do for him"
Gangsters will feed the heater eating heavy metal clips
Get bagged then fight them sentences like they have speech impediments
They’ll turn a bitch’ face to fish bait
And conjure up more blood than taking fish sticks off DJ Quik’s plate

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Blaq Poet]
Nobody knows I started it, nobody cares either
Niggas pulling out them heaters, them fire breathers
Duck behind a car, get behind a tree
Take the shit off safety and aim on one knee
Shots ricochet off the bodega, react quick, think fast, no time for a prayer
Little kids running and screaming
You can hear the sirens, here comes the whole precinct
Oh shit, dun got shot, get his gun, get his cracks, before the fucking cops
Shootouts nigga, that’s how it go down
In your hood, my hood, in every town
Remember what I told ya, stay strapped like a soldier, keep it moving like a motor
Cause a bullet don’t have no name, only hot heat for yo ass bringing mad pain

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Apathy]
When my man lost his job that’s the straw that broke the camel’s back
Baby momma bounced with his daughter, sanity’s about to crack
All this dude wants is his family back
Popping Xanax and trying to fight these panic attacks
And that stupid fucking bitch never answers a check
Putting pictures up on Facebook with some new cat
Fuck that, jumped inside his whip, heaters under the seat
Slammed on the brakes at a crib then slid to his feet
Running up the steps, heart’s beating through his chest, about to fucking body his ex
Kicked in the door, she screaming they was called 5-0
He put a hole in her head and watched the body fall slow
Daughter’s crying like crazy, kissed her on the cheek
Said that mommy was evil, and her daddy’s weak
Told her don’t cry, he’s on to a better place
Now hide under your bed, I promise you’ll be safe
Police pull up with tires screeching
Reaching for they pistols and they see him emerging like he’s a demon
Shots start to pop, until his body drop
Shootout shootout suicide by a cop

[Hook]
