[Verse 1: Apathy]
World war leader, ether raps, speakers shake
Ap speakin' mean as Idi Amin with a cheetah cape
Cheapest date, take a skeezer on a reefer break
Used to fiend for sneakers now it's realer 'cause it's real estate
Sealed the fate of a snake with a steel shank
Ain't in shape but I feel great, trainin' in a field of apes
Feel the bass, feel your face melted like a tape in a case
In a car in the summer motherfucker, you get erased
I'm magnetic, mathematically average street credit
Faster than your brain could process as soon as I said it
I triple it, quadruple it, it's futile to fuck with a pupil
Of Bruce Lee, I'm brutal fuck rap I'm Taps on a bugle
Ap's out of his fuckin' noodle, you new to this rap-a-necticut?
Scrap with me and get tractor beamed and trapped in Connecticut
I'm an advocate for traffickin' tracks like narcotics
And tunnel under borders like the Mexicans got it

[Chorus: Apathy]
I cause chaos, chaos, chaos
Let me shout this out loud and clear
A lot of rappers gettin' found dead 'round here
I cause chaos, chaos, chaos
Let me shout this out loud and clear (I cause)
A lot of rappers gettin' found dead 'round here
I cause chaos...

I'm seein'...
Body, after body, after body
After body, after body, after body
After body, after...
I'm seein'...
Body, after body, after body
After body, after body, after body (I cause)
After body, body, body...

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Yo, I'ma fuck forty whores while my shorty records
Nut in her eyes and blind her like Geordi La Forge
Formerly yours, you can call me "Lord of the Lords"
Hipster chicks are linin' up like for Morrissey tours
With every spliff that's lit, with every forty that pours
Mystic portals and doors open with sorcery orbs
I'm the source of '94, I'm the four-door Ford
They shot Kennedy in, put his brains on the floor board
I'm like the sword that was forged in the Mordor wars
I pack four-fours for force that'll leave you leakin' quarts
The type to toss a torch in ya kid's tree forts
I'm your greatest resource like Aquaman's seahorse
With no recourse, I'm runnin' up and gunnin' up courts
Turn Muslim in jail, my bitch will rock three force
My life story's analyzed inside The Warren Reports
I'm Doughboy pullin' Little Chris up on the porch, let's go to war

[Chorus: Apathy]
I cause chaos, chaos, chaos
Let me shout this out loud and clear
A lot of rappers gettin' found dead 'round here
I cause chaos, chaos, chaos
Let me shout this out loud and clear (I cause)
A lot of rappers gettin' found dead 'round here
I cause chaos, chaos, chaos...

I'm seein'...
Body, after body, after body
After body, after body, after body
After body, after...
I'm seein'... (chaos, chaos, chaos)
Body, after body, after body
After body, after body, after body (I cause)
After body, body, body...
Chaos, chaos, chaos...

[Outro: Sampled from the film The Holy Mountain]
"You have power and money, but you are mortal. You know you cannot escape death. But immortality can be obtained. I know where the immortals live and how to obtain their secret."
