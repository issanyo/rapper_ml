[Verse One] [Apathy]:
Yo, I get the paper so I don't care
Hoodied up, winter time, see my breath in the air
Timberland prints in snow you can tell I was there
Cribs filled with more treasure than a dragon's lair
Dragging hoes by the hair you'd swear I'm a caveman
No clubs, just a .38 snub in the waistband
I'm A.P
I like my pockets fat not flat like A.G
Make my profit back off raps so pay me
Not for the blow, crack or reefer
I went through more paper than an old Trapper Keeper
Your whole flows tired, give your mouth a rest
The way I stay in the lab, it's like house arrest
Douse your flesh with gas, light a match then laugh
Burn motherfuckers like Joan Of Arc for witchcraft
Do I think I'm one of the best?
The answer is yes
Cause I make shit bump like ?

[Verse Two] [Motive]:
You know me, ain't nothing changed but my age and cake
See your boy keep it raw like an asian plate
Your mans bout his loot but still trying to play it safe
Fans stand and show praise like Amazing Grace
I can teach you to grind a key, doe come back quicker
Even a blind man can see that I'm that nigga
Hoodie
I'm Doe Raking so I'm dealing with wealth
You would think I'm masterbating how I'm feeling myself
And I know you swear you hard and you willing to test
Till them arms coming out like a Timberland vest
On the real little homie, I don't like you niggas
I'm O.G
Ain't got time to fight you niggas
No grammer school, got hammers to light you niggas
First class have your motherfucking life delivered
And I'm far from a killer, go hard for the skrilla
Not a prob, menage with your moms and your sister
Rap machine selling crack to fiends
Having 'em bring me Iphones and plasma screens
What's hood?
[Talking]:
Shit nigga. You already know how I get down man. The whole crib like a pawn shop man. Hoodies Goodies. I got the X-Box, flat screens and pistols

[Verse Three] [Celph Titled]:
I'm not Arnold Schwarzenegger but I get to the chopper
SKS say yes, it'll break you off proper
From the top of your skull
I'm Darth Maul in a bar stall with a sharp claw that saws and cause oblong scars
This art form is beyond ours and bizarro
Your bars are soft and I just piss y'all off
Yeah you right macho man
I'm Celph Titled
The microphone Tae Kwon Do champ
And I'll get any show crowd amped
Godzillas rocks sold out stands
I stand out when I spit, shit I mean to
Steal The Show like I stole a Doug E. Fresh, Slick Rick single
Awwww man
I remember Puff Daddy had a shiny suit
Same time I was steady thinking of a crime to do
A couple credit card scams that was it man
Only big change any less is just bitch made
