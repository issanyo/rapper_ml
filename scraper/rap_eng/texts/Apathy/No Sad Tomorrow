[Hook]

There’ll be no sad tomorrow
Don’t you know that it’s so?
In my mind there’s no sorrow
Don’t you know that it’s so?

There’ll be no sad tomorrow
Don’t you know that it’s so?
In my mind there’s no sorrow
Don’t you know that it’s so?

[Verse 1]

I’m trying to ignore my depression, the bullshit that I’m stressing
Recession and every single move I make I question
My girl want more affection, my crew want more attention
I’m tense now I tend to stay away from any tension
It comes from all directions, my father says it’s lessons
Look into the mirror, can you handle your reflection?
I know so much aggression, I’m in a new dimension
Like rocking back and forth and cocking back the Smith & Wesson
And plus when I rap all these younger people pay attention
So what, now it’s my job to try and make a good impression?
My only advice would be follow your own direction
Save your money, don’t blow it, when you fuck use protection
And uhh…

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

When I die, fuck it I’m trying to go to Heaven
I been ready to die since the night of 9/11
Cause passion in my first step closer than my second
Third step and walking on a nigga with a weapon
There’s no sad tomorrow till we make it through the present
Anticipating still I grow impatient for my cheques
And money in my pocket, now this hustle shit I question
Just an adolescent music student, effervescent
Choose to manifest it, notice my inflection
Tomorrow is a scar I protected from infection
The iodine writer’s mind’s wires see connections
To landlines, watching landmines where I’m stepping
The bomb baby, calm poker face on my expression
For change and my days ever-searching for redemption
Mañana be my motivation, no discrimination
Deal with hatred, feeling great, Demigod affiliation
But I’m praying cause uh…
