[Verse 1: Apathy]
There ain't nobody survivin', there ain't nobody alive
Unless you made out of metal like RoboCop or Johnny 5
Evil washed out the hive, Clive Barker has arrived
Nosedive into the side of your house with a G5
Gee-whiz Mom, why you tryna make me get along
With all these sucker motherfuckers who make all them shitty songs?
I'm a vampire walkin' on the surface of the sun
There's a motherfuckin' nuclear furnace inside my lungs
You better do some soul searchin', look how crazy you've become
Like seein' a nun twerkin' while she's purchasin' a gun
You say you reppin' Brooklyn in your raps but you're still a herb
Who moved into the gentrified section of Williamsburg
I know the type of kid, the type who hid in every fight he did
Jumpin' on the mic and frontin' like he lived the life of Big
I'm like lightnin' shootin' right in the wig
Billed a butcher slicin' a pig right through the ribs

[Chorus: Sample and Apathy]
I put a spell on you
Every word, every line, every rhyme is control of the mind
I put a spell on you
Every day, every night, every verse I write by candlelight
I put a spell on you
Full moons overhead, words glow on the page that I read
I put a spell on you
In the deepness of the woods, in a circle with a torch wearin' hoods
I put a spell on you

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Who got the mox? Motherfucker just watch
I spit megawatts that black out a thousand city blocks
Fuck Glocks got a Springfield armory, accurate as medieval archery
That'll drain the plasma from your arteries
You're part of me, I'm partly retarded, a martyr
Taggin' cop cars with a fat marker, nobody harder
I'm Megalosaurus armor, I'm quicker than Peter Parker
Put crop circles in fields then I'm fuckin' the farmers daughter
I travel through vortexical portals made out of water
I slaughter the competition with spittin', why would you bother?
The author of holy scripture but I'm not the Holy Father
Ghostwriter like Shakespeare If you makin' the right offer
Them other rappers are softer, get buried with Jimmy Hoffa
Get off of me this is awfully obvious y'all are jockin' me
Usin' quotes from verses like reverse psychology
Rap isn't gettin' better, y'all just used to poorer quality
And I don't give a fuck if you tell me you never felt me
'Cause you probably just jelly your favorite rapper couldn't melt me
I probably shot some babies in your baby mama's belly
And her telly, watchin' Belly, wouldn't beat it 'cause she smelly
No-name rappers who sweat themselves really isn't healthy
Doesn't make sense like a paparazzi takin' a selfie
Let it marinade on some ice
I'm Kevin Arnold on the mic narratin' my life

[Chorus: Sample and Apathy]
I put a spell on you
Every word, every line, every rhyme is control of the mind
I put a spell on you
Every day, every night, every verse I write by candlelight
I put a spell on you
Full moons overhead, words glow on the page that I read
I put a spell on you
In the deepness of the woods, in a circle with a torch wearin' hoods

I put a spell on you
Every word, every line, every rhyme is control of the mind
I put a spell on you
Every day, every night, every verse I write by candlelight
I put a spell on you
Full moons overhead, words glow on the page that I read
I put a spell on you
In the deepness of the woods, in a circle with a torch wearin' hoods
I put a spell on you

[Outro: Manly P. Hall]
"Every religious, mystical, and philosophical sect has had exactly the same difficulty from the beginning of time. Where it is the person... who really believes that the esoteric truths of life are some kind of a secret... and that it is possible to find the key. Buy it, steal it, beg it, borrow it, through some way to get it... and that by means of this key we can suddenly unlock the shut door of the palace of the King."
