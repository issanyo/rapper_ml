[Verse]:
I'm a megaton time bomb, Ap never rhymes soft
That'll never happen like a Jew reading Mein Kampf
I'm off, my rocker, rocket ship to outerspace
Outta place with them other rappers coming out they face
Outta line, I'mma teach a motherfucker how to rhyme
Blow your eardrums out, they'll have to teach you how to sign
Y'all sound wack and if you're counting up your rap quotes
It's gonna be less than McCain's votes from black folks
Ap's white as bar soap
Maybe more like hard coke
Rap's fucking wack now that Kanye is all broke
While you popping champaigne and blowing out cigar smoke
I'm saving the city with a mask and a dark cloak
No it's not Batman, he don't do what Ap can
Jumping in the phone booth desguised as a rap fan
Champion and Timberland replace the cape
On a rampage, enraged like a caged ape escaped
Every rap I ever tape
Every beat I ever made
Has the same effect on you pulling pins from grenades
Or syringes in AIDS victim's veins
I'm sick, insane, despicable, unfixable in the brain
The thugs disappeared and everybody is fake
It's like I'm trapped inside a nightmare but I'm still awake
I used to use cream to make cake and shit out gwap
And now they using hip hop to turn rap into pop
And if you're living in that world today, I'm a world away
Aiming rockets at you to blow that world away
Steady with the heavy metal, your head will be shredded like Kennedy
I'm Connecticut's deadliest rap pedigree
Pulse pumping break beats, yours pumps techno
A faggot waving glow sticks, your outfits retro
Your haircuts metro, you never got the memos?
I'll stop you with Timbs till your face looks like Eggos
I'm freezing, I'm cold
I'm the reason it snows
Every season with flows that I speak it expose
So
Grab your Northface, party for four days
The only time we ever wake up early is for a court case
