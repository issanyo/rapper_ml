Chorus:
Just how drunk can I get
Very, very I bet
Run with that rum till I stumble like a pirate
I set em up, up then knock em down, down
I set em up, up then knock em down, down
I set em up, up then knock em down, down
Just how drunk can I get
Very, very I bet
Run with that rum till I stumble like a

Just how drunk can I get I'm Irish, a pirate
Minus the black boots and patch over my eyelid
Over the top violent always touching my privates
So finish up your guinness, there's sober kids up in Ireland
Stylin', smilin', eyes full of crimin'
I rob you for your treasure and bury it on a island
Timing is perfect, grinding is worthless
So gimme me all your shines, all your diamonds and purses
Rum's in my system, drums full of that liquid
Roll up on 'em clappin' them cannons like captain kid did
Listen! You don't want no drama, nada
Yo, where'd you get that gun from?
I got it from my momma!
Ain't nobody's son, I'm a demi-god father
Sippin' on tequila and I'm pukin' up manana
Drinks on the house, so that girl's tryin' to holla
But all I hear is blah blah, blah blah ba blah blah

Chorus:
Just how drunk can I get
Very, very I bet
Run with that rum till I stumble like a pirate
I set em up, up then knock em down, down
I set em up, up then knock em down, down
I set em up, up then knock em down, down
Just how drunk can I get very, very I bet
Run with that rum till I stumble like a

Just how drunk can I get, follow me on a mind trip
Sipping Jack's finest, drinking until my side splits
Ooh, I think I like this, pour me another, right chicks?
Put your money up sonny, now ( shake? )out you bee-I-tches
Yeah, this is my chick, pause like the heismen
Blackout, wake up with no clothes and a migraine
Everything is a blur and your brain is barely functionin'
All you're thinking is a-a-a-alien abduction
But it ain't no martians here, just cold lobsters here
I'll drain your quiz in Davie Jones's locker
Misconstrue what I'm sayin', but what are my assumptions
Hella burn you dudes in the flames of the flying Dutchman
No, I'm not gonna stumble, I'll probably outdrink ya...
Till you're mackin' the mumbles that charlie browns teach ya
All that's left on the scene is a murder theme now
But it ratin' repair the rockin' the burger king crown

Chorus:
Just how drunk can I get
Very, very I bet
Run with that rum till I stumble like a pirate
I said I'm up, up, and I come down, down
I said I'm up, up, and I come down, down
I said I'm up, up, and I come down, down
Just how drunk can I get
Very, very I bet
Run with that rum till I stumble like a
