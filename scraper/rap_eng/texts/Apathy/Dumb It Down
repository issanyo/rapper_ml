[Hook] [Apathy]:
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down get down
Now
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider

[Verse One] [Ryu]:
They told me dumb it down
The song is too underground
They wanted some other style
Or something with southern bounce
But this is southern Cal, sucker we rocking L.A
So we don't 'Walk It Out' unless you get shot in the leg
I tried to keep it simple and maybe create a dance
I need a single and I gotta repay the advance
So get stupider, pockets are getting poofier
Shooting up the chart and won't stop when it hits Jupiter
Damn, if you don't want your band's stock to plummet
You need a hook so catchy your dog spot can hum it
So understand it's a game, but you gotta get paid
So if life is handing me lemons I'mma make a meringue
I let it rain
Hot Chicken Noodle Soup in your seeds
Make you chew on some Laffy Taffy till you ruin your teeth
Any musical feat's possible if you want a hit
Just grab an 808 kit and dumb it down a little bit

[Hook] [Apathy]:
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down get down
Now
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider

[Verse Two] [Ryu]:
Yeah, I dumb it down but I'm sticking to the truth
And I don't mean no soda with no Chicken Noodle Soup
See people are a medium, marshmallowed up
Listen to the stereo inside a small yellow bus
And now they going mad with some crazy type of
Trend where grown men rap in baby diapers
And I could care less who distributes the coke now
I got more respect for all the members in O-Town
You dig it?
Cause now the streets can tell
So stop picking all your lyrics out your Speak N Spell
Now you in the top 10 but who writes it sucks?
Try picking up a pen in your life for once
But what?
It's too hot, puffing kush in the Rover
He should be on the block getting pushed in a stroller
Looks like they need a hit for the year so here's one
Just a little something for the preschool eardrums

[Hook] [Apathy]:
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down get down
Now
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider

I dumb it down for ya
I dumb it down
I dumb it down for ya
I dumb it down
I dumb it down for ya
I dumb it down
I dumb it down for ya
I dumb it down

Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider
Get stupider, get g-g-get stupider

[Hook] [Apathy]:
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down get down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down down
I dumb it d-d-d-down, d-d-d down get down

"Get stupid"
