[Hook: Apathy] x2
Reportin' live from the muthafuckin' Iron Curtain
I don't think that I'm nice, homie - I am certain
Try to step to this mic, I might uppercut ya
Ice cold, flow strong like Mother Russia

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I keep my mind on the cheddar, the nine on the dresser
The rhyme is a lecture, the violent professor
That shines under pressure, a diamond-ish texture
I'm the flyest forever, I'm fly as a Cessna
You wonder why you ridin' a Vespa
And I arrive in a fresher ride, leave you tied to a stretcher
You stressin' and petrified that you gon' die when I catch ya
I'm the best alive, lines electrifyin' like Tesla
Survivin' the test of time and you in line buyin' Kesha
Rob you blind with a nine, what a bind when they find you in pine
With a spike through ya spine and I spat in the spot where they left ya
I'm the god of the best of the best of the best and the better
Every muthafucker ever, from '85 to forever
Take 85 of ya craziest favorite rhymes and they lesser
Than 8 or 9 of my laziest lines that I threw together
It's stupid to measure or stoop to the level
Of you atheist 85 percenters, or any other percentage
I'll wait 'til you 85 and you dyin' and got dementia
Then enter ya nursin' center and kick you right in the dentures
My intention is turnin' you earthlings into indentured servants
And then it's curtains, and then I'm certain you men are serpents
Fuckin' snakes, you sketchier than Professor Snape
I devastate any rappers that try to replicate
Send 'em to heaven's gate, but they ain't on the guest list
Now they don't even ex-ist, please show 'em the ex-its

[Verse 2: O.C.]
Check, most of these rappers like compost
With the exception of the seeds in the dirt when they converse flows that don't grow
Let's take a trip into the mind of a sealed bridge
It's time and place through space and real life affairs;
The results are mind bendin'
Grabbin' your attention is my intention
It's not about a vow or takin' vengeance
That Perestroika emblems in the skies mean tend it
There's nothin' like us, and if it is than it's infringement
I'm back in the trenches so fasten ya seat belts
And brace for the ride of ya life when I start the engine
The game's a farce now, but I still take it serious
Juice I spew, some view lines as luxurious
The opposite of Fuhrer when I occupy Europe
Gold dust litters the floor when I'm in the buildin'
Of Mice and Men, I get the same results with a sword or a pen recordings when the madness begins
Not one for trend following, we set out to make 'em follow
Words empower, god of music soon as Apollo
Violate embargoes, stick to the Congo to Cuba
Just to secure Peretroika's future
Dissolution of the Soviet Union
In '89 you could say we started the revolution
