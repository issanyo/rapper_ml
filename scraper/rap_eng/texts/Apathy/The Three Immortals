"explorers, in the nether-reaches of experience. demons to some, angels to others.... now you must come with us"

Enter the dragon with 3 immortal surgeons
Ark of the covenant and the holiest excurstions
The search for the knowledge and the wisdom of the sands
The hologram sends you to the abode of the damned
Immortal like vampires
Setting fires in the caverns of the unholy
Oh the ancients, a hope of Abraham
Send you to the sacred land
To change form, preforming rituals that leave you scorned
Crown of thorns adorns the unborned in which you spawned
There is no shelter from the storm of Babylon's lost children
I lead millions to the promised land
The holy lamb
The planetary hologram
Blowing your chakras to oblivion
Digital man
Biblical man, like silian
Vanishing breed
The holy throne
Presidents of the united states are now clones
The zones of the virus
The eye of Sirus
The last waltz of the tyrants
The harvesting begins now
Infinite information like wu-chai-tao
But how
Will you withstand the power of the helix?
The crucifixion of the phoenix
The black thesis will burn you
Give to you the darkest of afflictions
Mortal MCs face the verbal crucifixion

"i am in fact lacking confusion as to what's real and what's illusion" X2

The infinite, grand planet
Ish ka Kha Shalamha, Most High
Called Ali Aba, astronomer
Roam the universe like Romulus
Indigenous with consciousness of Sirius
I am a 7 density light being
Transmanifest personally
In divine nation Atlantis rising
3 dimension radiation is extremely
For difficulty to cope with the body
Externally, in the centre of the galaxy, Alchemy
Spirit soul mind commitment
So that's efficient, receive nine dimensions
Of cosmic expansion exquisitely
Philadelphian church chosen city
Add instance to vortex's
Pleiadian Sequence Equinox's
At the zero point. Dialoguing
Keeping time flying
Sitting on carpet and Meditating
3 Immortals... Through portals!

[hook]
The plot thickens;
Through psychological crucifixions
I mar MCs and travel lands guiding Christians
My writtens escape the earth in certain crisis
I Create raps for Christ and 12 righteous tribes
Educate with positive vibes
Devastate your dimension and nobody survives
Out of smoke we rise
Illuminating eyes and wise
Teaching Lost fools that Yeshua never dies
I cry, try to cut off my air supply
I'm a transport to space, let the mother ship fly
Annuni, seven signs
Let the Dolphin be the Baptist
With self contained underwater breathing apparatus
In Atlantis Digital image screen enhances
Photographs of alien ships upon ya planets
Emerge from Volcanoes, Dreadlocks and Halo's
Presto- changeo, I Morph to tornadoes
And tear up ya major metropolis
You fish tank guppies couldn't fuck with the octopus!
