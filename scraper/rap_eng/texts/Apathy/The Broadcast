[Intro:]
This is the Voice of America
The following program is in Russian

[Hook: Apathy]
Transistor radio, transmission's live
Tune this frequency in, if you want to survive
We broadcastin' for those behind enemy lines
We broadcastin' for those behind enemy lines

[Verse 1: O.C.]
Yo, call me a verbal alcoholic
Domestic abuse against rappers I torment
I hope ya had form while I chilled then laid dormant
Each line up until the last bar, then the chorus
Is murder, in the verse spittin' slugs from my taste buds
Each tap counts, 'cause ammo I don't waste none
This is a power trip, so listen up clear
You can love it or leave it alone, this is my year
Pray I lose, terror cell, light diffused
Icon, nice on mics, enemies I bomb
In the midst of it all, see, I managed to remain calm
Shower napalm, me and my liaison
Pull a Bugs Bunny, click the lights off
Swing a bat like I'm fenced in the dream, now you seein' stars
A beat for me is a obstacle course
I run through it till each and every level of it's done, gone

[Hook x2: Apathy]
Transistor radio, transmission's live
Tune this frequency in, if you want to survive
We broadcastin' for those behind enemy lines
We broadcastin' for those behind enemy lines

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Every verse that I write is murder, but take it slightly further
I'm like the Burgermeister Meisterburger
Ice cold heart, great white shark, my soul's frozen
Rappers stay posin', get broken and blown open
Loadin' shotguns like they assassinated Malcolm
Leave you leakin' like a highly anticipated album
Check the blueprint made from the greatest rappers' legacies
Blood fetish, Ap is Vlad Țepeș to my enemies
Heads on stakes on the path to my kingdom
'Cause I'll overthrow the system before I become a victim
Victor Von Doom leave your body floatin' like a pontoon
Pond scum rappers gettin' flooded by this monsoon
Mean Gene Okerlund, dopest from here to Oakland
Yodelin' on the top of a mountain shoutin', "I'm doper than
Any rapper you co-defend", I'm poisonous like cobra phlegm
Feds focus photo lenses so we speakin' code again
{"A few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone"}

[Hook x2: Apathy]
Transistor radio, transmission's live
Tune this frequency in, if you want to survive
We broadcastin' for those behind enemy lines
We broadcastin' for those behind enemy lines

[Outro: O.C., Apathy, (sample)]
We broadcastin' for those behind enemy lines
We broadcastin' for those behind enemy lines
We broadcastin' for those behind enemy lines
We broadcastin' for those behind enemy lines
Ayo, call me a verbal alcoholic, nigga
Hu-huh, yea-yeah, call me a verbal alcoholic nigga
Hu-huh, ayo
