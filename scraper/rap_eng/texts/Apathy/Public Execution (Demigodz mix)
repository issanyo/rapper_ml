[Scratch Hook: Sample (Celph Titled)]
Hit ya (uh), switched ya (uh), right out the frame
Hit ya (uh), switched ya (uh), right out the frame
Right out the frame, right out the frame
Right out the frame (Yea, yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
I'm an accident just waitin' to happen, plus I'm an insane
Motherfucker with a hunger pain to be the first blastin'
And my gun's a Gatlin', forcin' crews to break up
And stickin' up rappers when they walkin' outta Jacobs
I'm on the block with my dogs, walkin' you cats
To the depths of Hell, I could have you offed in a snap
Lookin' awkward at ya rear view, see my scope, peer though
And hope ya still here to, see your career through
Shoulda seen them bullets racin' in, now homicide
Don't know where the shell casings went, even the finest
Forensic scientists can't fuck with me, gettin' super ugly
With a Ruger right in front of me aimin' it at ya mothers tummy
You claim ya carryin' heat, please... go and finance our hooptie
And you'll find that that's the only time you re-lease
'Cause you ain't never busted gats, bitch you bout as ill as a cure
Get my finger near a trigger, I'mma spill it for sure
Fire repetitive shots, leave you beheaded for not
Respectin' Celph Titled, Is you stupid or not?
I came through whylin' on a murder all mission
And left you fuckin' dead like a perverted mortician

[Scratch Hook: Sample (Celph Titled)]
Hit ya (uh), switched ya (uh), right out the frame
Hit ya (uh), switched ya (uh), right out the frame
Right out the frame, right out the frame
Right out the frame

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
Cats I've assaulted, call me the high exalted
Eso-terrorist, their cleverest nemesis
I'll forever diss these cats, it's effortless
Sever their wrist, with this disc on the premises (motherfuckers)
Journalists said there's none better
You weak creeps read it and weep like love letters
I bring malice, we smash ya palace
Weave past cats like Steve Nash in Dallas
I did your man a favor by writin' his words
When he didn't have the money that my writin' is worth
When you fuck with Esoteric you go right in the hearse
When you mention dope cats, Seamus Ryan is first
'Cause I keep spittin' heat 'til I'm dyin' of thirst
While you try to rehearse, you better tighten your verse
Demigodz... labels try to sign us at birth
Just knowin' we could be the finest rhymers on Earth

[Scratch Hook: Sample (Celph Titled)]
Hit ya (uh), switched ya (uh), right out the frame
Hit ya (uh), switched ya (uh), right out the frame
Right out the frame, right out the frame
Right out the frame

[Verse 3: Apathy]
I'll rip a whole in the ozone and leave you suckas spinnin' in space
I'll spit in ya face to show you how a clitoris taste
At this pace you bitches'll never finish the race
I'll play the shit from your tapes and make you admit it's a waste
You're always after the cash or after the ass
But you'll only be ashes and gas after the blast
It doesn't matter if your made of matter or mass
I'm releasin' raps so powerful they're shatterin' glass
Put a rapper in a cast from his neck to his toes
Dissectin' my foes, peel away the flesh from the bone
Testin' ya dome, to see if it can take the pressure from blows
That are thrown like small stones in a cyclone
I'm terrible, beatin' you faggots and tearin' the beat into fragments
Then eatin' rappers like Tarrantula's feedin' habbits
You drop lines that you fuck hot dimes
But ya cock size will make her eyes roll counterclockwise
I'll crush rhymes with a singular line
If you can't hold the weight, it'll injure ya spine
I'm not ill like walkin' in the projects with a nine
I'm ill like movin' solid objects with the mind
I was designed by a scientific staff that studied metaphysics of math
Tryna' develop the perfect paragraph
I'm spittin' raps that'll make your mother laugh
Then travel over water and land like a hovercraft
I raise my staff like Moses and open up the oceans
'Til transparent walls of waves are exposin'
Whales in motion, floatin'
While deadly tiger sharks are approachin' ready to rip 'em open
