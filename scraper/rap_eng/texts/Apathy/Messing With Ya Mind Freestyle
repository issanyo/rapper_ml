[Sample]:
You've seen the way they've done your boy
And your boy's still down

[Verse]:
I love the summertime I can open all my windows
Let the winter die, homie, put away them timbos
Analyzing life cause it's bigger than just rap is
And economically, I live where the white trash is
There's one thing that supersedes race, color or creed
It's oppression, no question, that's that coporate greed
They keeping motherfuckers dumb, then they easy to control
There's no way to hide or run, cameras on light poles
There's fast food in our bodies
That's why we're feeling groggy
America's a sloppy Wal-Mart full of zombies
This ain't political, motherfucker it's physical
There's poison in our water
Posion, literal
It's like a bad dream
It's like a nightmare
And I'm distracted by rap music and Nike Airs
I'm only human man
And that's my human side
I brush my teeth with fluoride and that's suicide
This ain't conspiracy theories, I wouldn't waste my time
I wouldn't waste a beat, I wouldn't waste a rhyme
And fuck Republican and Democratic little devils
It's only Bloods and Crips but on a bigger level

[Hook]:
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
