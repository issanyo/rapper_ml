"Keep on"
"Wanna make ya...feel good"
"Keep on"
"One two, alright party people in the place to be"
"Ayo"
"Ayo"
"I excel"
"Yeah, 'bout to get live"

[Verse Two: Apathy]
I'm Derek Jeter with a bat to your speaker
Terrifying creature in a pair of fly sneakers
Paralyze preachers with a pair of fine divas
On the dick, he will send 'em on some sinister shit
Ap' will finish you quick
Quantum Leap in your body and start a suicide mission
Competition kamikaze
Nike's or Huarache taking shots I'm sloppy
White trash douche bag in a stolen Maserati
Posing for paparazzi while hoes looking foxy
This Hennessy and Saki got my memory foggy
Bury enemy's bodies
Better yet we burn 'em, exterminate 'em and turn 'em into ashes
Then insert 'em in a small urn
When will suckers ever learn?
Cause we always got they sluts on us soaking up our sperm
I be Good Will Hunting for a Harvard degree
An MC working harder than a Carpenter Bee
A.P
