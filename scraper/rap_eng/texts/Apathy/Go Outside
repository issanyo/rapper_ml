[Hook]
Should we go outside, should we go outside
Should we go outside, should we go outside

[Verse 1]
Mama said “baby, don’t go outside”
As the disaster hit us
It turned the city into ash and splinters
I had to differ from the general opinion
I don’t think it was nature, I believe it was man who did it
3am as we heard the explosion
Bomb rockin’ like a comet as it burned through the ozone
The ground shook and the windows imploded
Glass shattered through the living room, the ceiling was opened, yeah
Straight anarchy among the people
Terror groups telling us: “Now we’re your fucking leaders!”
Anthrax in the water supply
Hear the cries of a father as his daughter just dies
On the brink of a post apocalyptic civil war
Survival is a privilege, but what the fuck we living for?
Looking back, it all should have been a lesson
Now it’s stupid when you think how all this could have been prevented

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Fuck what Mama said, boy you better go outside
And give a helping hand, to your blood and your fellow man
Tell the damn militants they can pack bags and leave town
‘cuz we’re getting sick of these beatdowns
But in the meanwhile, stop and reflect at the technology
That steady brought us into this mess
All the rulers in power who abuse and devour
Fascinated, masturbating to a nuclear shower
Man made, devout faith in these biblical scriptures-
Means apocalypse could happen in a nuclear winter
With a mutant agenda in your human placenta
Unless you make a decision, ‘cuz baby, you could prevent this
From taking place, you saving grace is your willingness
To educate and free a slave from his ignorance
Let’s evolve and take a step to the street
Where we’ll soon explore stars, together in peace
