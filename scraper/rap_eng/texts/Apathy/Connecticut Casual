[Hook: Anthony Kiedis]
It's hard to believe it, there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
I don’t ever want to fee like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don’t ever want to fee like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Around the time when Fresh Prince’s show debuted
And back when Nickelodeon had Double Dare and Hey Dude
My mother’s ex-man Neil drove a Honda Prelude
Hung out with some bikers and he copped coke and quaaludes
Gnarly on the Harley white people party hardy
And keep me up at night so at school I’d be tardy
Tag the desk with a sharpie, high on Ritalin, a zombie (how high?)
Higher than Blondie, a fucking Kamikaze
Sometimes I feel like the bomb and no one can disarm me
A black hole sun, that’ll melt your plastic Barbie
A Comi in the sixty slickers  Rikki Tikki Tavi and
Cobra  Kai Karate I’ll body anybody
Ap’s awesome, I'm bad as Chad Dawson
A rad with rap, clap 'em and trap ‘em in black coffins
I’ll crack the sarcophogous cover and curse a motherfucker
The pharaoh that hovers above the pyramids they discover
On the surface of Mars, while you purchasing cars
I’m trading blood to the gods that are purchasing stars
On the Block Island ferry, rocking a pair of Sperry’s
I out of Nantucket fucking hoes, popping cherries

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Apathy]
I don’t wanna feel like life’s not real
I flushed a whole bottle full of Xanax you know the deal
Medication’s like slavery, anti-depressant
Is how the rich kings controlling the poor peasants
And we ain’t even human anymore, just gremlins
They let us bear arms
But we register our weapons
So even if we ever had to start a civil war
They’ll be looking up your profile and kicking in your door
Hardcore, quit school before I was sophomore
Used to hate my principal so I keyed up his car door
Now I’m on tour watching my back in the bathroom
Cus you Saskatoon natives are famous for stab wounds
Watch colours that I rock in LA, they don’t play
Had a father that was Deep, he was Furious I was Tre
Mad styles all these faggoty rappers is fragile
Fuck a message in a bottle, put raps in a crack vial
