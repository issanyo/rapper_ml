[Verse 1: Apathy]
I heard that your mom is an nympho, a stupid blonde bimbo
Who sucked of all your friends in the prom limo
Fuck a new Bugatti, I want a bitch who do pilates with a super human body down to do bukake
Foul mouth make bitches go down south
And you don't gotta live in an igloo to get round housed
With I rap it ain't fiction it's only fact when it's written
So just imagine me bragging it might be something like jacking a jet liner to China the baddest Momma is a stewardess started to suck a cock in the cockpit
Her vagina getting my sperm, the 9-11 inch size alone is like a saber tooth tigers major incisors
No survivors inside us because no opponent defy us the flyest rappers on bias
It's like the heaven supply us If it ain't written by us then don't buy it
You can shut up and listen and be quite
Me and ANoyd is like the hulk on 'roids
Album's fresher than Altoids we feeling like cowboys
We poison inside opponents blood stream destroy his brain cells brain dead then we searching for your voice
And this static and white noise will ghost haunt the shows
I've ghost written hundreds of flows for dead foes
So face it your so basic you say your wild on tour but nobody ever set off your house arrest bracelet

[Hook]
Stop trying to ride my wave
I set sail and be gone for days
I'm global your local homie I thought I told you
And what do you take me for a little local pushover?
Stop trying to come up quick
I'm on a yacht with a stuck up bitch
I'm global your local homie I thought I told you
And what do you take me for a little local pushover?

[Verse 2: ANoyd]
King ANoyd, live in the flesh
And as far as chosens I think I ran to Percepelous
My mind is a cathedral named effortless
Don't buy bull only if it's the testament
Then leave your eyes black on both sides Most Definately
Anoyd's parallel bars doing a buck .03
Add 3 I bet you a nominee I love seating whack MCs
Rest your pen game? I never let my arm rest
I uphold tree in my left hand while my right arm making you feel my wraith
While I toss you in mediteranean sea, the two shot capri
Son nerve Guard your teeth
I root canal you my Valium comes on tower of babel
Cowards cowards when they around you
