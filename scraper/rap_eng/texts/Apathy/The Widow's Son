[Intro:]
“Let the brother receive the light!”

The widow's son, the wickedest one
The widow's son, the wickedest one

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Off comes the blindfold, fools cop diamonds and buy gold
While wise old elders try to tell us that my soul
Is lost in the Matrix, a box, a cube
You watch the tube and eat up all their toxic food
Now the chemicals are blocked from the pineal gland
For the first time I understand Ezekiel’s plan
That the sanctum sanctorum of the most divine
Is the body and the stairway to heaven is your spine
As above, so below, fuck waitin' on a sign
The key to heaven's gate is in the mind
God bless the blind; let the light shine, step from the darkness
And follow in the Father through Solomon’s arches
The wars over religion show that humans are horrible
The bible's allegorical… not historical
Mortals never get it so they try to control
Free will, free speech and even each other's soul
Stroll through the temples of the monks and the rabbis
The medicine men, the metaphysical Medjays
The bodies get baptized, the wise get chastised
You taught you should pass by thoughts of your past lives

[Chorus]
The widow's son, the wickedest one
The widow's son, the wickedest one
The widow's son, the wickedest one
The widow's son
You can't define what's direct from the east

[Verse 2: Ryu]
I don't control the economy, mess with animal sodomy
I don't know Illuminati but I'll show you geometry
The Pythagoras of rap, son of music and math
You know the myth but let's try to decipher the facts
I'm from a league of gentlemen, Amadeus to Duke Ellington
Ty Cobb, Louis Armstrong and Thomas Edison
Policemen and veterans even without a weapon
I'll cover 'cause every brother keeps a .357
So when we go undercover, ain't no witchcraft and devil shit
It's how we greet each other on the five points of fellowship
The pillars of Noah inscribed with the sciences
The eye of Jehovah watches over me like a lioness
The square that reminds me to square my actions
And the compass that'll help me circumscribe my passions
I'm attracted to the light like a moth in the dead of night
But internet conspiracy theories hoggin' the megabytes
I pay 'em no mind, I rep it with pride
They ain't concerned with the truth it's not as sexy as the lies
'Til the day that I die, but yo I already did
I never felt so alive 'til they gave me the true grip
Peace to four-letter, three-letter, P.H.A's
It's York Rite, Scottish rite and the DeMolay's
O.E.S., yes can't forget the brothers before me
Shoulder to shoulder I stand with you all in the quarry

[Chorus]
The widow's son, the wickedest one
The widow's son, the wickedest one
The widow's son, the wickedest one
The widow's son
You can't define what's direct from the east

[Outro]
Wickedest one
I have the power!
Wickedest one
I have the power!
Wickedest one
