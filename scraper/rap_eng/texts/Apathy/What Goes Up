"Somebody please, give me just a minute
To explain, my misery"

"What goes up, must come down" - Lords Of The Underground

"Somebody please"

[Verse]:
December 31, 11:59
On the roof counting down looking at the city shine
In his mind is that lifestyle he’s leaving behind
We ain’t gotta talk about it, you can read between the lines
But he got a job hope it pays, whole squad smoke haze
Blowing smoke, joking, reminiscing of the older days
It’s New Years Eve believing that the seasons
For whatever reasons cleans our sins and cast out the demons
Soon as 12 hits, he pulls a single bullet
Kisses the tip and says this is the last time he’ll pull it
Let it slip into the chamber, stops, says a little prayer
Aims it at the sky, shoots it up into the air
As the bullet gains velocity and rockets to the heavens
Traveling a few miles in just a few seconds
He feels better, real better like a weight was lifted
He escaped a wicked world and let the bullet take it with it
But what goes up…must come down
And all the way across town falling to the ground
That little piece of metal found a real familiar face
Home boys girlfriend, wrong time, wrong place
Out partying with friends in a line at a club
Stood right beneath the path of an earth bound slug
And a it’s really very odd or a plan from God
But the bullet struck her head like a lightening rod
Bad news travels fast, cell phones maker it faster
He’s girls bestfriend called depicting the disaster
Immediately it clicked, the bullet from his clip
Just blew the love of his life's brains to bits
Must be calm, before all of the negative drama
Ironic, made him vomit on the front of his bomber
And said it was the last time but really thought it through
The guns got one more job to do
