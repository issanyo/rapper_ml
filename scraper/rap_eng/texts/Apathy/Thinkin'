[Outro]

But she thinks that I’m slick
She thinks I’ve been with another chick
I guess that’s why I’m sitting here crying baby baby baby

[Hook]

Blah blah blah is all I hear
When you spitting that bullshit up in my ear
Cause you think too much yup, you think too much
You think too much yup, you think too much

Blah blah blah is all I hear
When you spitting that bullshit up in my ear
Cause you think too much yup, you think too much
You think too much yup, you think too much

Don’t ya know, don’t ya think

[Verse 1]

I’m thinking that you’re very paranoid
Trying to blow up dumb shit and wonder why I get annoyed
I’ve been thinking all of this drama is crazy
You’re like a baby mama but we ain’t got a baby
My homegirl told me you’re watching her with binoculars
Sitting around thinking deeper than a philosopher
I’m thinking you’re thinking up past, old ass birds
Trying to get my Myspace and email passwords
You’re going through my phone, you ask what’s inside
You say if nothing’s wrong I have nothing to hide
Ah ha ha very clever (will she ever get the point?)
Hell no, never, it’s the principle
My mental is invincible, you never see me bitch
I might as well be invisible, listen everything is fine
But you’ve got too much on your mind

[Hook]
Blah blah blah is all I hear
When you spitting that bullshit up in my ear
Cause you think too much yup, you think too much
You think too much yup, you think too much

Blah blah blah is all I hear
When you spitting that bullshit up in my ear
Cause you think too much yup, you think too much
You think too much yup, you think too much

Don’t ya know, don’t ya think

[Verse 2]

I know what you’re thinking so tell em
You sit around and think until you blow your cerebellum
You thought that I was cheating, you thought I had a side chick
Thought that you were right like you think that you’re a psychic
Women’s intuition or just your suspicion
I think it sounds like a bunch of bullshit fiction
I’m fresh dressed like a million bucks
And you’re nuts motherfucker cause you think too much
I’m pimping dolomite style up in the Lincoln
Deep as Rakim when I’m sitting back thinking
Thinking of a plot, thinking of a plan
Thinking some more dead presidents in my hand
And I’m tired of buying sneakers, it’s evident fam
So I think I’ll take the cheddar and invest it in land
So listen I’m pulling over you can hop right out
You got a long walk home and a lot to think about
Start walking

Listen baby, don’t think about it as walking home in the rain alone
Think about it as more time to think that’s what you wanted anyway, right?

[Hook]
Blah blah blah is all I hear
When you spitting that bullshit up in my ear
Cause you think too much yup, you think too much
You think too much yup, you think too much

Blah blah blah is all I hear
When you spitting that bullshit up in my ear
Cause you think too much yup, you think too much
You think too much yup, you think too much

Don’t ya know, don’t ya think

[Outro]

Don’t know that I’mma thinking
Thinking, I said I’mma thinking yeah now
