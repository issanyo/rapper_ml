[Verse 1: Planetary]
Gotta get it while the getting's good
Man fuck them haters, ain't no time to even sweat the hood (Nah)
Gotta rise above the jealousy
Them niggas don’t give a fuck regardless what you’re telling me (Nah)
They gone get you when your back turned
Snatch up the dinner plate, smoke you till the ash burned
Man I’m telling you the streets watching
Time to man up, nigga you got 3 options:
The first one's die like unlike a soldier
Second one's man up and let the game mould ya
The third one's to retaliate
That’s the way it is
A real choice for a man to make
Gotta find an honest man to shake
But that’s impossible we're living in a land of snakes
So at the end of the day you gotta do you, man fuck what they say
Stay true

[Verse 2: Spirit of Truth]
Throw me in the fire, leave me to the trap
Beat me to my last breath, bleeding on my back
But if I’m still breathing then best believe I’m coming back
10-four-10-huh-10-guns-10-roh
Gemstones in this cold life making it work
Troops spit that real deal take em to church
And awaking in a ___ as you break up your herb
And understand the lesson in a breaking of a curse
Earth is a cold place, grim and dark
Where your best friend stole the hole that stores your heart
Your fake fan tricked off and told the narcs
And now you down tryna pick up the broken parts
But page that define the process of purification
The suffering in elemental fertilisation it builds character
Patience is imperative basics necessary for the spirits embracement
Dig that?

[Hook: Planetary + Spirit of Truth]
No matter what you gotta keep moving
Gotta stay focused niggas that’s the key to it
Uh. Revolutionary street music, you know
We built tough coming out of these ruins
No matter what you gotta face through it
Stay positive nigga that’s how we do it
We never give up we all stay strong
No matter what coz we strive to live on

[Verse 3: Apathy]
Ya. They say the good die young
So imma probably live forever coz the hood I’m from
Is like Puerto Rican, black and white pieces of shit
Parents can’t pay for tuition so they teach us to quit
Frequency been received to TVs during shows
Convert gentlemen’s to booms and young ladies to hoes
It’s like God's been replaced if I did the right math
I calculate a celebrity is the new golden calf

[Verse 4: Reef the Lost Cauze]
Yeah... coz life is but a mystery
So many people want you to bask in their misery
They stand but they don’t have a delivery
I just want the real ones to remember me
For all those who staying true to my word
Listen close all you do is observe
And watch the snakes they come from afar
I ain't gotta call em out you know who you are

[Verse 5: King Syze]
Fuck the snakes and the rats at the stage of my life
It’s the main culprit or the ways that I write
When I’m working hard you can never master ethic
What I write is always ever gonna ___ a copasetic
Especially when times hard
Yo my rhymes squad
Is on a blueprint designed by God
And no matter all the hating
Yo we on another Plateau
Don’t get it twisted
Yo we riding for the cash flow

[Hook]
