[Verse 1 RYU:]
You see us coming through the door with our hoods up
Eyes low sipping on that good stuff
And you ain’t gotta ask if you need a couple bags say Daddy come and give me some sugar
You see us coming through the door with our hoods up
Eyes low sipping on that good stuff
And you ain’t gotta ask if you need a couple bags say Daddy come and give me some sugar

Kids idolize us, mothers all despise us
Cuz I keep ‘em higher than the bottom of a sky bus
Try some powder sugar pie crumbs
Hundred dollar booger hooker look at you girl you’se a fine one
I could make your mind numb if you so decided
You don’t want to try it quiet I can make your mind up
You should come and find us who knows you might enjoy it
Choppin' up a line up on the top of a toilet
Stop trying to avoid it boys and girls
Come get your poison it’s funner and cheaper than a toy is
You should see my clientele I ain’t saying names but
I can build a train track everybody’s buying rails
True fact people at Warner are fuckin’ high as hell
How can you explain putting RYU’s shit up on the shelf

[Verse 2 Apathy:]
Now here is a story all about how
This old-school shit flips upside-down
See the ’80s wasn’t always so shiny and colorful
Living comfortable as Coogi sweaters on Cliff Huxtable
When you was in the womb sleeping peacefully to grow
I was in my womb while my parents sniffed blow
See they were teenagers misbehavers
Who left little straws, mirrors and razors
You think this shit is fly ain’t a damn thing funny
Someone broke into our crib and stole our Christmas money
And when I was a little kid all of my bad dreams
Consisted of cokeheads, burglars and crack-fiends
All that glitters ain’t gold I promise
Shit was fucked up when Reagan was in office
Food stamps, government, Jesus and cocaine
I never knew a single soul who owned a rope chain
