[Apathy]:
Motherfucker I make power moves, with the power of Zeus
A pack of rabid gorillas that just broke out of the zoo
But not the zoobalie brutally, beat 'em, eat 'em, they food to me
Suckers foolishly fool with me, better stop the buffoonery
I'm a lunatic, literally with looney bin lunacy
Howlin' at a lunar eclipse, I'm losin' my shit
Catch me on the moon with your bitch
Refuelin' my ships, resuming my trip
To Jupiter where humans are rumored to be like mutants
I’m usin' a fireball that I’m shootin' outta my palms
Like bombs, I'm napalm in this song
I play beer pong with cups filled up with Energon
There's a reason why me and Megatron don't get along
I'm the evilest, rottenest, rippin' out your esophagus
Put slugs in your mugs, see more blood than phlebotomists
I'm a bottomless pit, Ap's the obvious pick
When askin' who would impale you upon an obelisk tip

[Blacastan]:
Crash your grill like the plane on the cover of License To Ill
Bitin' what I'm writin' just to heighten your skill
But stealin' out my rap book won't get you a deal
Black renaissance, scribe ill scripture with quills
My sword is a pen that's protectin' my art
Florescent colored Mozart, right from the heart
I enlighten with the scrolls, Malachi York, act like you know
I sent soldiers up in your fort
We ain't the same nigga, you ain't cut from my cloth
I rep Demigodz
On top of water we walk, that's real talk
That's for Bost and CT and New York
Eat my ziti with tomato sauce, I don't do pork
Stab Satan with the pitchfork, you switch when you walk
Transves
Faggot niggas can't be the best
Black rhinos, stampede straight through your vest
The ghetto Bobby Fischer, like Fresh with chess

[Panchi of NYGz]:
These faggots saw the Panchi chronicles and then I heard they hate it
But I can't be violated or even decepticated
I got gunners out in Brownsville, shooters from the east
Killers out of Fort Greene, slicker than grease
Broads from Bushwick, that'll give a buck fifty
To any bum dusty nigga who try to talk shifty
It's best to befriend us, don't try to offend us
I done fronted on niggas that's bigger than the bar tenders
Make me dip until my pants pull up
This .45 and push your fat ass into a curly fry
You don't wanna play my blast on your wack broadcast?
Then you and your whole staff can kiss my black ass
Niggas take what I say back home, give it a listen
Then revert to G religion like a Muslim or a Christian
Or a Baptist or a Jew dude
[DJ Premier]:
(Panch they love what you do)
Yeah, I got 'em hypnotized like I'm doin' voodoo

[Celph Titled]:
If I'm in the trench I'm manning the machine gun (man)
You are Carl Jr. managing beef on buns (bitch)
The whip creep with the 007 mods
Press on the gear shift, missile at your entourage
If I got time for a meeting, it's only cause I wanted to glare at my watch
And find out I made a little mo' gwap (yup)
The warning's on the wrapper like a cigarillo package
The best blow to my ego's like you threw a pillow at it
I'm off the chain but got it on lock when I write shit
I'm on some Crocodile Dundee, "this is a knife" shit
(Ain't my material dope?)
So dirty it need antibacterial soap, I know you feelin' it though
DGZ, NYGZ, we spit rampid
Uncover your scams and
You'll get a visit from Chris Hansen
C dot Titled shoot chrome nozzles
Dissin' rappers downhill in wheelchairs and make 'em perfect role/roll models
