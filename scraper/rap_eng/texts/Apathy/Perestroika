[Intro: Apathy]
I ain't on YouTube or none of that shit, lookin' for all these videos... tryin' to tell me what I should think.  You still gettin' programmed, you stupid motherfucker. I do the knowledge by myself. I read between the lines

[Hook]
We've heard it all before
We've heard it all before
We've heard it all before
We've heard it all before

[Verse 1: O.C.]
Yeah, deep topics are prone for less profits
No matter what the industry does, they can't stop it
Things are so obvious, shit is all common sense
Government promises, bullshit economists
House of Representatives lobbyin' laws
Backed by b, I know the system is flawed
From the California coast to these eastern shores
Servicemen being deployed, fightin' these wars
Big men choked out for sellin' bootleg Newports
Violate his rights, takin' his life
See, life's truly a blood sport (ha)
Even strong lumbers cut down to match sticks with the buzz saw
Gettin' chills down my spinal cord, readin' through the final chord
We'll soon be extinct like the dinosaur
We our own worst enemy
Hatred, jealousy, envy, if I'm murdered; don't avenge me
That get-back will offend my spirit
Eye for an eye, another man slave, let God clear it
Compassion don't exist, plus the media embraces
Foul reports for the stations and higher ratings

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Yo, I'm not paranoid, I'm just not stupid
To think the water they give me I'm drinking's not polluted
I watch the television muted lookin' for the mutants
Human beings are bound to change from those pollutants
I shop from local farmers, all these global horrors
Got me thinkin' the world's over, there's no tomorrow
I'm stockpilin' guns, stackin' up funds
Buy some land in the woods if the Armageddon comes
Canned food by the tons, look after my loved ones
Gas mask, hazmat, keep the poison out the lungs
We used to be Kings who only bowed to the Sun
Rain Dance for the crops, not a knot full of ones
All these children is zombies on they Xbox Live
Motherfuckers nowadays don't even play outside
Get a bike for that Teletubby, chubby little bastard
No afternoon snack, and he felt like he fasted
Amazin' how it's lasted this long
It won't be much longer 'cause these earthlings are so out of touch
Touchscreens, text messages, social media replaces
Face-to-face conversations here in the Matrix
