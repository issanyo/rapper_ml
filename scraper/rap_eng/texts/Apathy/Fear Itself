[Intro: Clip from Excalibur]

Merlin: What are you afraid of?
Arthur: I don’t know
Merlin: Shall I tell you what’s out there?
Arthur: Yes, please
Merlin: A beast of such power that if you were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, it would burn you to cinders
Arthur: Where is it?
Merlin: It is everywhere! It is everything! Its roar is heard in the wind! And its forked tongue strikes like… bright

[Verse 1]
King spit it all like I’m D-O-C
Deadly on the mic, demi G-O-D
Born in a forest, raised by the wolves
Walk amongst sheep rocking their wool
Speaking in tongues, well allow me to translate
A secret society, just look at our handshakes
Hoodies on our head, dressed in all black
Symbols on our rings and a pocket full of crack
Cameras on a street corner like a camcorder
Dip quicker than a Star Trek transporter
This is life on the bottom of the barrel of the belly of the beast
On the brutalist of blocks in the borough
In the East where I’m from Connecticut’s a wasteland
Chased by the devil, keep the metal in your waistband
And we powerful as Kennedys
March in a single-file line like centipedes
In Cape Cod to escape the commotion
Late night yacht trips, bodies in the ocean
A 40 ounce full of potion
We move by full moon light in slow motion

[Interlude]

The only thing we have to fear is fear itself

So run for the hills, scream for help
Ain’t nothing to fear but fear itself
So run for the hills, scream for help
Ain’t nothing to fear but fear itself

So run for the hills motherfucker (fear itself)
So run for the hills motherfucker (fear itself)
So run for the hills motherfucker (fear itself)
So run for the hills motherfucker (fear itself)

[Verse 2]

We on that cracker-ass shit, hoods and bank robbers
Switching up kicks quicker than Mr. Rogers
Sweater on my back dressed like a senator
I’m Chris Hansen about to catch a predator
Newport mansion peeking through your window
Job at a country club just for the info
Deep in the woods in a circle like a pagan
A young caucasian studying Ronald Reagan
So we speak Latin fluently
Drink OE cause I love it what it do to me
Fuck around, get a beat down brutally
I’m like Judas, I’ll stab you for jewellery
OG, ain’t a damn thing new to me
Pharaoh with a harem of hoes who love nudity
Rhymes designed in barbarian time
Check my crops, it’s all alien signs
Belt buckle with the Masonic math
Black Starter Raider jacket, an addict to witchcraft
I’m the Uzi carrier, groupie burying
Pass passwords to a secret librarian (shh)
Access to the Vatican scriptures
We posing for pictures with fingers on triggers
And candle in cyphers, we tunnel under Rikers
To break out my brothers and them Outlaw bikers
We the righteous

[Outro]

Scream for help, ain’t nothing to fear but fear itself
So run for the hills, scream for help
Ain’t nothing to fear but fear itself

So run for the hills motherfucker (fear itself)
So run for the hills motherfucker (fear itself)
So run for the hills motherfucker (fear itself)
So run for the hills motherfucker (fear itself)
