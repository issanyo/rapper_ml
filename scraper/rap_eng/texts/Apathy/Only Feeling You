[Verse One]
In the summer we talk to girls, very flirtatious
Skirt chasers if the shawty's curvacious
Careful of the statutory, checkin' what her age is
1st, 2nd, 3rd, make my way around her bases
Sweat pretty faces even if she has braces
Big breast, chest, blessed in all the right places
White, black, Puerto Rican, Asian, all races
If she's got a body and it's bangin' then he chases
Booty on this cutie was fat just like laces
On Adidas, sweetest thing since some Now-N-Laters
Cats try to cock block, watch them player haters
Talk to the same chick, slick slip her his pager
Number, motherfucker try to diss ya like he hates ya
Just to get a chance, advance, maybe date her
Cats gotta watch that trash, I'll check you later
Believe that the beef will be greater
Your grief will be deeper
Under the impression she would break you
Walks up to great you, "You're Apathy ain't you?
My friend used to date you. She talked all about you
Said she used to love you, but now she fuckin' hates you."
Oh well, ex to the next I suppose
No time for overconfident hoes or fraudulent foes
Time moves on, I'm off to flier and better chicks
Drivin' their Jetta whips
Not after that cheddar shit
I'm tryin' to murk it and run
Smirk, workin' the tongue
Purchasing purses and pumps, shoppin' spree with my funds
Chicks who try to cheat cause they think flirting's fun
I think I'll hold out, I'm waiting for the perfect one

[Hook] {X2}
And with all these girls swearing that they're realer than you
Running up to us saying that they feeling the crew
Not even close to understanding all the shit we've been through
I let 'em know I've been true and I'm only feeling you

Through the good times
And the rough times
Yo, you're so fine
You're my sunshine
Through the bad times
And the great times
Shake your waistline
To the bass line

[Verse Two]
I was hypnotized, eyes were fixed upon this chick
Brown hair, body thick, had to talk to this 'dip
So fly I couldn't believe, she had me intrigued
To be honest, I thought that she was outta my league
Beautiful eyes, surprised by the intellectual side
Didn't even think about the sexual vibe
Incredibly tight, diggin' what she said to me right
Got her number and I called her up the very next night
Best friends and soul mates, manifested from this
Satisfied with this miss and never messin' with chicks
A blessing in physical form, who would've thought a simple kiss
Could relieve stress and bless my messed thoughts with bliss
Replacing aggravation, hate and frustration
With attention, affection and some relaxation
Lovin' this space I've been placed in
So thankful for patience
And happy I'm the one she has faith in
I feel like Q-Tip, talkin' to Bonita
And I need to see her to feel her, you know how it goes
Cause even backstage at shows with hip hop hoes
Approach and try to jock our flows, I'm like "hell no"
Bet that ass will be shakin' sayin' "Apathy's blazin'"
But I let 'em all know I'm happily taken
No matter who bitches without a clue pursue
And every time I let 'em know I'm with you
