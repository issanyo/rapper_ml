[Intro:]
Welcome to the future

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I got the juice, the ruler of the world like Zeus
Hounds of Hell on a leash I’m about to let loose
New school Audi A6 with GPS
Old school BMW with BBS
A neurotoxin poisonous as BBD
Turn on CBS or the BBC
I’m a beast planting seed up at 3 BMs
I’m the BB Kings typing on BBM
Make more moves than M.J. or MMA
I’m like the IRA or NWA
I’m A-P, that’s me, my initials official
See the 9MM on the side of my pistol
I live in CT, I chill in LA
I need that USD, I stay well-paid
I’m DGZ, I’m GBC, I been a G since the date was BC
I don’t fuck with LOL or BRB
I’m more LONS plus PRT
I’m AOTP, put you on the IV
Head honkey in charge, the HHIC

[Hook:]
Yeah and it don’t quit
I can break it down like whatever you want
Yeah and it don’t quit
Trying to sneak peep the recipe
Yeah and it don’t quit
I can break it down like whatever you want
Yeah and it don’t quit
And you don’t stop

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Put out an APB on Mr. X to the Z
Grew up on NWA and the DOC
I can’t sing or play guitar like the BOB
But I can put you underground with this .223
I’m an ammo dump, you a vagina for sale
You a long running joke like SNL
Go to sleep with a dream waking up to hell
Spellbound, hypnotized when that fiction fell
Anything on the street you can get it in jail
THC, PCP, heroin, the reals
Nigga ain’t shit free, my shit COD
Cripple a victim, hit your system like HIV
Tried to position intervention but you MIA
Fucking G-A-Y, it’s in your DNA
I’m a POW stumbling out of the jungle
Leeches, malaria on me but still ready to rumble
Notify the FBI, call the CIA
Hit the ATF, tell them to bring more tanks
Definition of the mission, competition is none
What’s a punk-ass pistol to a Gatling Gun? C’mon

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Apathy]
You could be the submariner and never reach this flow’s depth
I Cobra Kai those who try, get your shin bone swept
I’m a magician like Egyptians think of Imhotep
I slice backyard bullies, let Kimbo step
It’s not a smart idea testing if this rhyme’s real
You’re better off breakdancing through a minefield
It’s the way that I’m built, I’m a pompous jerk
Motherfuckers get killed like a Scottish skirt
Send an SOS, Ap is XXX
From the LBC to the South BX
Y’all are DOA, let the coroner cover you
You’re WTF, Ap is FTW
I’m FTP, it’s in my DNA
Got a DUI from the E&J
They say that I OD, they say I’m an OG
I just tie up a score and throw it in OT
I love OPP, I got OCD
Word life, I got OC’s old CD
I miss ODB, fuck the FCC
I miss Fab Five Freddy on MTV
