[Verse] [Apathy]:
Jet set on my space shuttle
Runnin' Apathy is a Kennedy
Another Cape Cod, summer money like the Vatican
Diamonds like I'm African
Red light, green light, this is drug trafficin'
It's the Olympics on Mount Olympus
I'll buy a small planet before I'm out of business
Party over here
Party over there
Cost a couple G's to breathe the same air
Call me King Friday, y'all are straight Monday
Don't hurt your brain, you'll understand one day
Call up Apollonia, Ap is on the phone for ya
Make a pretty mess on your dress then I'm over ya
Listen

[Scoop DeVille]:
Put your glass up, it's a celebration
Standin' on top of the couch gettin' wasted
Need another bottle so I'ma call the waitress
I ain't gonna drank it, I just want to shake it
Shake shake it, shake shake it
Shake shake shake shake it
Put it in the air, spray it everywhere
Put it in the air, spray it everywhere
Party right here, keep them haters over there
Party right here, keep them haters over there
Party right here, keep them haters over there
Hater over there, them haters right there

[Sample]:
Pull the string and I'll wink at you
I'm your puppet
I'll do funny things if you want me to
I'm your puppet
I'm yours to have and to hold
Darling you've got full control
