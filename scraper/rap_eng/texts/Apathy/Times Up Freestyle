[Verse]:
You lack the minerals and vitamins
E pills and Vicodin
It's frigid when I spit it, you think it was liquid nitrogen
Yeah it's me and Mike again
Back up on this mic again
Frightening, attacking like a pack of angry Viking men
If y'all are nice, then Ap's flow is mean
A machine that accumulates cash flow and cream
I'm a fiend for a bad fat ass ho in jeans
If I was a Transformer I'd be Asshole Supreme
I'd never say gwap, it's as simple as that
And I never keep the sticker on the brim of my cap
Man, these young dudes never dress as fly as me
A tee hasn't gone to my knees since I was three
It's far better to let go
Y'all could never get doe
Ap got the best flow
Head harder than Destro
A god on the mic, y'all should consider me generous
For lettin' there be light in the beginning of Genesis
Cause I've been raw since Neanderthal was cave paintin'
Before Weezy was Wayne, and Game was gangbangin'
It's hard to explain but my brain is ancient
Gotta slow down my flow for y'all and be patient
My voice is sacred, watch your girl get naked
And the pussy gets so wet, it floods your basement
Fuck Freddy, I'm Jason
With machetes I'm chasin'
If you let me erase 'em, I'mma bet they replace 'em
With another ordinary motherfucker that rap
But fortunately, lyrically they ain't tougher than Ap
And fuck money hungry hoes, I won't feed your children
I'mma put you on your knees and feed you children
And I'm pretty much famous
For delivering anguish
In a million different places
From Compton to Cambridge
Your brain's too simple to decipher my language
So I'll let my man Big Mike tell you what my name is
