[Intro]
*Got to pay your dues baby you know the rules!*

[Hook] x4
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Yo everybody wanna rap but nobody wanna work
Want their face on a shirt wanna make the bitches twerk
Wanna take over the earth but they're afraid of the dirt
And they're scared of criticism and gettin' their feelings hurt
Everybody want results and they want it real quick
Wanna spit and have a label tell 'em that it's a hit
They wanna whip, want a chick with some big fake tits
Want Back to the Future kicks, hoverboards, spaceships
Wanna be J. Cole or maybe Kendrick Lamar
You can't duplicate and replicate the makeup of a star
But they copy their bars, no blood, sweat and tears
Frustrated they been doing this shit for two years
Want their songs on blogs, got a whole attitude
Like a rap career appears quicker than fast food
Wanna go on tours, wanna reap the rewards
But you can't win wars... if you never swung swords
You can't...

[Chorus]
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

[Bridge]
But how many heartaches must I stand (how many?)
Before I find a love (uh)
To let me live again (yeah)
Right now the only thing (one thing)
That keeps me hangin' on (one thing!)
When I feel my strength (yeah, yo)
Yeah, It's almost gone (yo, yo)
I remember mama said (yo, yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 2: Apathy]
This is dedicated to instant gratification
Y'all ain't really dope... it's just your imagination
You ain't never really moved the crowd and you can't
I'm a giant, you an ant, you a fuckin' food stamp
I'm the champ, like Jason Voorhees to your camp
We would kill the sound system and blow out the amp
And you'll never have a chance when they chantin' my name
I can't explain, but I drive your whole campus insane
'Cause you never knew the times when hip-hop was alive
I used to cop S&S tapes on 125
Dues paid, crews sprayed, dissin' raps you made
This is Jonestown, suckers musta drank cool aid
Motherfuckers never doubt it when I'm burnin' these mics
And I'm still killin' crowds 'cause I earn these stripes
And there might be fistfights if you wasn't that nice
We used to walk up in the parties like Jedi Knights
So what's love? Studyin' Illmatic like the Bible
I wanna drop vinyl... you'd rather go viral
As far as I'm concerned there will be no survival
Or the takin' of my title cause I'm too homicidal
You can't...

[Chorus]
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
