[Verse 1: Slaine]
I'm too stupid to give a fuck
In a coupe or a tinted truck
With a nuclear bazooka
I'm puking the venom up
When your future is a nuisance
You tired of the nooses
Gruesome how I grew up
Screw up, violent, abusive
Defining music, trying [?]
It's a hallucinogen, Lucifer moved into the building
My music's ruthless, yeah I just have to do this
A blasted blasting the tune as I massacred Massachusetts
I captured actresses, laid it back flatter mattress than rulers
It's an action packed [?] so fracture backs or medullas
Ask who the bastard is that asked him to do this
And look what Affleck did when he took my ass out the sewer
Splash your doors, grab the ass of your whores
And peep the rap that I spit, I got a passion to do it
I'm irrational, I hit the gas and crash in the Buick
Drinking Captain and acting like an ass while I do it

[Hook: Slaine]
There ain't nothing like hip-hop music
There ain't nothing like hip-hop dummy
There ain't nothing like hip-hop pussy
There ain't nothing like hip-hop money
You should know who I am at the stage of the motherfucking game, yup!
In his rib cage is the rage of a razor, raised with dysplasia
Hold on to your gauge or be afraid of your neighbor

[Verse 2: Apathy]
There ain't nothing like hip-hop, stupid
Was raised in the sewage and putrid bodily fluids
I grew into a mutant like Turtles in Mutagen Ooze
I mutilate crews, leaving stupid humans confused
You're at home wearing tutus, jerking to Blue's Clues
While I'm on a booze cruise feeling up huge boobs
I been in a few feuds, and murdered a few dudes
I'm popping a few ludes to listen to Rude Jude
I keep a TEC in the trunk, I listen to Juju
I'm miserable rapping, practicing mystical voodoo
These rappers is chewed food, I treat 'em like crude fuel
Old-school, new-school, shit 'em like loose stool
Got loose screws waving a deuce deuce on YouTube
Rap while I'm two moves from solving a rubix cube
Leave your bitch covered in the pool of pubics and lube
Puking up spooge with both eyelids glued
Never get it misconstrued, I be pissing missile fuel
Mr. Cool get up in your bitch quicker than Zuul, yo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bishop Lamont]
Okay, raise your hands if you wanna die tonight
I have Jim Jones' punch, and bullets for the whole family!
Currently I'm turbulently ill
Controlling your metastasis
Rappers all cancer patients in stage 4 I kill
Eat through you, ether you, see through with a set of skill
Window sweeping your feet from beneath you like a ninja will
Call me [?] motions equal Ezekiel's will
Repo souls, the weasels turn you pit bulls into beagles squeal
Hide inside this homicide when we emerge
Sadomasochistic get masked with axes lurking like the fucking Purge
Went from Mass dealing from Cal', either style I'll kill you pal
Meanwhile, all you rappers really fucking boring us
So me and Slaine side-by-side kill like Ikari Warriors
Reminiscing from a distance that I could destroy you in an instant
Ra's Al Ghul, a ghoul, street mystic
Real hip hop rock since I was an infant
Lif was golden era so now I really miss it
That's why there ain't nothing like this hip-hop music, bitches!

[Hook]
