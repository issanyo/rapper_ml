[Intro]
Yeah it’s the campaign
Apathy what up
C T to M A
Wanted change right yeah
All I know is about booze and hoes oh no
What more could a gentleman need
All I know is how to rock the show oh no
I ain’t saying that the gentleman’s me

[Verse 1]
The fire I spit inspires guys to dive in the pit
I’m off the wall like higherline giant sized to you Prince
I’m flying high
You idolize my prize prime is a gift
I like my dimes giant diced
So they can grind on my dick
Let’s bring a bunch of Camp tramps up in the spot
We get amped leave them with Gramps dancing their twat
Hold up I’m getting nasty
Go catch a taxi
Your flow is extra tacky
I will disrespect you badly
You impress from extra flashy
I’m in rap with the nastiest word spitter you heard sicker
They can sit in the back of the hearse with ya
Then watch me see it go
Sit and watch the genius flow
When I was three years old I could crack the human genome code
How can I do it when I’m dropping the same rap and got chronicle flame action
Come follow the brain patent
Smashing bitches yeah
We get em all in a stance and have them blow us one by one
The demi-gods of The Camp yeah
G is the author of classic rap verses
You ain’t seeing me like you needing binoculars
God party doggie yes he is the targeter
Streets ended up in the ease of philosopher
The Camp is demigods we handle any slaws
Dismantle many dogs
Your tramp will get me off
She swallow semen sorry buddy you are not in season
Claiming that you getting slept on like posturepedic
Stop repeating not believing it you just lost
Not freezing not competing with this bet dog
No question the set’s strong so get gone
You on that CD then I’m breezing to the next song
Off the head I may say your effortless
Brain waves intelligent vacate your residence
Put your money up that’s payday I get your chips
Serve anybody from Baystate Connecticut

[Hook]
All I know is about booze and hoes oh no
What more could a gentleman need
All I know is how to rock the show oh no
I ain’t saying that the gentleman’s me

[Verse 2]
Hey now look it’s The Camp your breath of fresh air
I tell you what
I bet by next year we on top
And you now we got that behind us
We some master rhymers
Y’all some fat vaginas
Y’all geeks are sweet like banana slush
Y’all ain’t man enough to take a piss standing up
See I’m a go getter
I’m like a professor
Watch your old heifer
Cuz I’m a homewrecker
I’m in a new act
You in an old Jetta
You like a plain burger you got no cheddar
I mess around to get Donald Trump cash
All you chumps had was a McDonald’s lunch bag
See I’m a gigolo and
I’m gonna hit your hoe
She looking for dick like yo where did Richard go
Yeah I’ll get it
My rhyme is sick
I’m TI spelled backwards I am it
We got fans camping out on the campus for The Camp show
[?]
You’ll be spending food stamps
What more can I say champ
I’m gonna teach you how to be fly like this is Space Camp
Watch out it’s wugged out haters take the thug route
And try to set up camp like they were Cub Scouts
I packed the clip and hit your face till my pistol break
Cuz I’m jelly with a camp like Crystal Lake
You can push powder like Crystal Light
Move snow like Christmas night
None of that means that you can whip a mic
Whip you if you pick a fight
Beat you down in a inch of your life
Then walk away laughing like Vincent Price
You flash cash and you could get knocked for loot
You pack max please this does not compute
Your little hoe thinks she’s so hot and cute
Well this one time at band camp she pussy popped the flute

[Hook]
All I know is about booze and hoes oh no
What more could a gentleman need
All I know is how to rock the show oh no
I ain’t saying that the gentleman’s me

[Hook]
All I know is about booze and hoes oh no
What more could a gentleman need
All I know is how to rock the show oh no
I ain’t saying that the gentleman’s me

[Outro]
Come on
