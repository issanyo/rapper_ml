[Chorus][Sample]
[Its breaking my heart ]
[Tearin' me apart]
[But it looks like magic to me]
[And right from the start]
[It shouldn't be this hard]
[But it looks like magic to me]

[Verse 1:]
I wanna be your David Blaine
Give it to you in a major way
I could be your Flava Flav
Matching grills, I like you braids
You could fill the position
You could be my sexy assistant
When I'm doin the trick
I put you in the mix and then we can all get real explicit
A tisket, a tasket
Girl let me work my magic
Unzip it, your trippin
Like you just took some acid
Its mystic, ethereal
That silky, material
Girl I ain't ever sharing you
Like Lucky Charms cereal
I'm feelin you
I'm fuckin feelin you
I keep it real with you
I hope you feel me too
I mean I'm feelin you
So fuckin feelin you
But like any magician in my position
I ain't revealin you
Never

[Chorus:][Sample:]
[Its breaking my heart ]
[Tearin' me apart]
[But it looks like magic to me]
[And right from the start]
[It shouldn't be this hard]
[But it looks like magic to me]

[Verse 2:]
Hang up the phone, I lay in bed
Your voice is voodoo in my head
Your evil magic casts a spell
You wicked witch I'm trapped in hell
You sign through the air with candles lit
It's powerful I can't handle it
I speak in tongues, I'm so possessed
You stole my soul right from my flesh
This mystical magical hocus pocus
Super-cala-fragilistic-expe-ali-docious
88 Toyota Supra doorless
Puerto Rican girls that tagged my notebook
South side school seein Steven B
On my radio, only played Easy E
I'm GBC, I'm so CT
I'm magical, just wait and see

[Chorus][Sample:]
[Its breaking my heart ]
[Tearin' me apart]
[But it looks like magic to me]
[Right from the start]
[It shouldn't be this hard]
[But it looks like magic to me]

[Verse 3][Sample]
[Wands...magic]
[Leprechauns...magic]
[Wizards...magic]
[Unicorns...magic]
[Sorcerers...magic]
[Witches...magic]
[Johnsons...magic]
[Orlando...safe]

[Chorus][Sample:]
[Its breaking my heart ]
[Tearin' me apart]
[But it looks like magic to me]
[Right from the start]
[It shouldn't be this hard]
[But it looks like magic to me]
