I’m the misbehaving, pistol waving, shooting shifty ricocheting
It’s amazing instigating,fights till my fist will breaking
Bitch you’re slaving [?], this is Satan in the flesh,no imitation
Stoned of the grim stone, hell fire inhalation
Impatient sick of waiting, sick of pacing in my room
In syncopation with the shit that’s playing feel it boom
Sick of chasing chicks I'm dating,dick 'em and I'm quickly skating
Spitting insignificant ignorance mixed with information, inspiration

Hoes indoor, fasten indication kids are waiting
For the latest Demigodz installation,integrating
Deadly virus, vaccines in the patient here’s an invitation
Got your sister tied up in my basement
Innervating flows, old literate can’t take No Doz'
Like I’m sick and laying in my bed hallucinating
Shoot to facing, ahhh
Dudes are waiting outside your hospital room pacing
While you’re recuperating I'm feasting
On raps no doubt Ap's beasting
We bullet holes from gats you cats are just bee stings
These things that we do are actions of heathings
Fuck with me you lucky that your lungs are still breathing
Achieving things that most humans could not
Since I was little in the cold and my nose was leaking snot
Fuck what Dead Prez said nothing is bigger than hip hop
It’s a long shot, but I’ll be at the top

Ap's unstoppable, smash through any obstacle
Get money long as cocaine stay choppable
Walk upon a chick and mask her astrological
Vomit on myself I’m sick of how phenomenal
I rock the mic it’s like a biological
Weapon that explode and melt your body molecules
Uzi in a shopping bag making less spottable
A meth manufacturer, Ap's so methodical
Bad news motherfucker,can’t outfox
Straight villain we filling up socks
With jagged box,the batteries in my winter hats
95% of about getting stacks is stripping chicks
Naked like cinemax
Got New England on padlock
Visit your little sister in college to steal a laptop,bitch
That’s word to my Reebok black top
I'm at home on Xbox fucking at black ops
Ever since Chris sang about a black cop
I was down at Sesame street selling the Fraggle's rock
It's wicked cold out, throw on your winter coat
We the reason why your little bitch is so into coke
I put your head out, I put your head out
Jump off an spread out
I put your head out, I put your head out
Pump put your head out
Jump off and spread out
I put your head out
