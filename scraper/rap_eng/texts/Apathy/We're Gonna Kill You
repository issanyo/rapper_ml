[Verse One]:
When the sounds produced it's like razorblades around the noose
A nemisis, venomous as a Brown Recluse
A little too complex for these simple rap crews
I've been ripping tracks since I rocked Triple Fat Goose
When my tongue starts spitting, cause tons of friction
Klashnikov's Clash like the Guns Of Brixton
The shit y'all are playing is just horribly wrong
We should Hang The DJ like Morrissey song
I don't want them dead but I wanna see them gone
Rush the stage like KRS did PM Dawn
These little dudes is so soft man they might get hurt
Stomp his fancy headphones and rip his hedgehog shirt
I want to put these little fuckers on blast but wait
If you call someone wack they dismiss it as hate
So if nobody's wack then is everybody great?
You get emotional from criticism that's a femine trait
These Seth Green look alikes dropping these queer songs
Frat boy soundtracks, anthems to beer pong
You say that you love the hate, it pumps you up
But nobody's hating, we just really think you suck

[Hook]
Shoot down though these MCs
We're gonna kill you
We're gonna kill you
I see the pile up
Shoot down though these MCs
We're gonna kill you
We're gonna kill you
I see the pile up

Killing everybody in sight (X8)

[Verse Two]:
There ain't no way that you can stop, I'm gonna take down your posse
And put you in a wheelchair like Drake on Degrassi
You faggots in the party started acting all artsy
I'mma flatten your body and autograph it with a sharpy
Picking on these suckers running around like jerks
You ain't A Jerk, you're a jackoff in a tight ass shirt
I'll make you jerk a little more when you seizure on the floor
Kick down your bitches door and jerk off on that whore
Y'all are sounding like Charles with them sloppy ass soft flows
Bitch never paid dues, only made blog posts
Publicity is suspect, what the fucks next?
After beefing with Hex and getting punched by his ex
I'm disgusted
You're telling me that this is what the future holds?
The pee wee league is playing in the Super Bowl
I don't know who souped you up but guess what
Nobody's hating we just really think you suck

[Hook]
Shoot down though these MCs
We're gonna kill you
We're gonna kill you
I see the pile up

Killing everybody in sight (X8)
