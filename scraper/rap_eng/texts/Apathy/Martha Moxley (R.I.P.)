[Hook] {x2}
Live from the shores of the East
Where the rich beast travel to feast
Old money that pays off police
Martha Moxley, rest in peace

[Verse 1]
I never sweat the competition I'm accomplishing more
Like a gun connoisseur in a communist war
Indestructible, Ap is as hard as the iron curtain
Find a virgin, I'm inserting shit inside her like a surgeon
You're a serpent I can see you slithering like you from Slytherin
Light ya body on fire, piss on you I hear you sizzling
Here's one for the sinners, hold up ya middle fingers
For all the strippers getting older and bitter
For all single mothers that cannot afford they babysitter
So they copping liquor then call me to come thru and dick her
Get the picture? Life isn't always a happy ending
I'm cool with being positive but not cool with pretending
'Cuz way back in the day when there was still Hartford hockey
Around the time when Michael Skakel murdered Martha Moxley
My father met my mommy and the rest was kinda foggy
But he shot me in her womb and then I grew in to a body
The only son of Rodney, my legacy is Godly
The Demigodz posse, the opposites of Ghandi
The East Coast Rapist, Honkey Kong, Master Mason
Mass invasion of the greatest rappers that'll bash ya face in

[Hook x2]

[Bridge: Apathy]
You are now listening to the sounds of Connecticut Casual
Representing, for all of New England
Apathy, Demigodz
You rich motherfuckers better lock up your yachts real tight
Shoutout to ?

[Verse 2: Apathy]
This is like breathing mustard gas
Or walking on crushed up glass
New jacks cut class and you'll get fucked up fast
I'm so powerful, words of a wizard who cast hexes
Da vinci on his death bed drawing his last sketches
I'm reckless, shot gun blast to the solar plexus
Look unto the East, I'm as deep as Masonic lectures
Y'all are cheap as Lexus fronting with Honda engines
I'm beyond dimensions of your common comprehension
And your Comi-Con conventions, I'm Amun-Ra's vengeance
I'm Unicron, eating up planets and shitting remnants
I use the blood of gods to power my ship's engines
I'm hiding under cars and slicing Achilles tendons
You can feel the tension
Terrible, horrifying, swing a sword of iron
Mortals are crying, "Oh Lord I'm dying!"
Tried courterizing wounds but the coroners arriving
And the wars that I'm surviving got natives immortalizing
Every verse that I'm designing like Egyptians did Orion
Like Neptune with a triton but, I ain't even trying
I ain't even lying, I'm relaxing on a giant Voltron Lion
And flying through space when Ap is rhyming

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
The next day, her body was found in the Moxleys yard
Hidden under the retreat, she had been brutally beaten and stabbed to death
