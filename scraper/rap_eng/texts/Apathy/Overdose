[Verse One] [Apathy]:
Welcome to Heaven baby
You wanna have my babies?
I wanna fuck you like an animal and give you rabies
We're like Sid And Nancy
Lil' kids and family
And after all this time I still try to sniff your panties
You wanna puff your reefer
We can discuss my Beamer
Pump Justin Beiber
And let me fuck your beaver
You got my brains in outer space like a space pod
Let's load the AK and vac in Cape Cod
I'm rockin' J. Crew, listening to Jeru
White trashin', laughin' at the hickey's that I gave you
You're poppin' MDMA, playin' MGMT, we'll hit the MGM Grand
In a luxury suite
Scoop DeVille I really fucks with this beat
You're the reason why these birds are gettin' fucked in the beak
The reason why blunt guts are getting dumped in the street
And the reason why
(And the reason why)
Girls O.D

[Chorus]:
Money, hoes, cars, clothes, liquor stores, sticky 'dro
Wanna roll? Let's go
I can make you overdose
I can make you overdose
We can spazz out, splash out, stuntin' with the cash out
Fuckin' till we pass out
I can make you overdose
I can make you overdose
I can make you overdose

[Verse Two] [Ryu]:
I heard you like the color black
I like black too
I like white girls
You like black dudes
I'll get a deep tan if it makes you swallow me
Suave with the swagger, you can call me Pauly D
#AttherealRyu, bitch, follow me
Drop them jeans, I'll change your genealogy
Back seat of my Jeep, you're so scholarly
Brain so good, you could quite possibly
Get a college degree, in astronomy
I'm on another planet, holla at me
Holla at me

[Chorus]:
Money, hoes, cars, clothes, liquor stores, sticky 'dro
Wanna roll? Let's go
I can make you overdose
I can make you overdose
We can spazz out, splash out, stuntin' with the cash out
Fuckin' till we pass out
I can make you overdose
I can make you overdose
