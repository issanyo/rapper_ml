"The beats make me falling asleep, I keep..."

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I wake up early in the morning, like time to make your donuts
Jump into my Nikes cause the girlies love 'em so much
Fresh, fly, sneakers I tie
Even though my girl cook I should have some humble pie
Cause my heads in the clouds so I jump in my Ferrari
No steering wheel, a controller for Atari
Drive out my driveway made of gold bricks
And an Old English water fountain beer it drips
So I turn on the radio and guess what I'm bumping
A new hit single by Boogie Down Production
Pull up to my job, park in my space
Put my space helmet on cause I work in outer space
At a factory that assemble porn star chicks
I test how my dick fits in-between her lips
And I just got a raise and it pays like a million dollars a day
On my day off I play golf with Dr. Dre
And he said he'd make me a beat
My alarm clock beep guess I'm walking in my sleep

"The beats make me falling asleep, I keep..."

[Verse 2: Spin 4th]
She's right in front of my desk
She at the copier in a real tight dress
And she staring at me, eyes so compelling
She walked over to me and released her melons
And now she in my lap and she kissing my neck
That's when she said, "Excuse me, who the fuck you staring at?"
Damn, my eyes are glazed, step out of my daze
It's only lunchtime, it's a real long day
And I'm kinda embarrassed, go and grab some eats
That's when I see a Lambo' speed down the street
And the driver pull over and he hand me keys
So I pull out a knot and I hand him the cheese
I get in, drop the top, I'm feeling the breeze
Then I picked up a shorty that I wanted to skeez
I heard a horn blow
"I don't know who you are
But would you please get your hands off my brand new car buddy?"
I'm like, "Fuck." looking like a creep
Daydreaming over a whip that's parked on the street
Sometimes I can't tell if I'm awake or asleep

[Hook]
