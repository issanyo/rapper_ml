[Verse 1: Apathy]
Underwater where the bodies are hidden
I'm livin' deep inside a sunken ship with skeletons driftin'
Amongst blood hungry mermaids who feast on sailors
And impale them with harpoons stolen from whalers
I'm the Kraken attackin' 'em, draggin' you deep in the ocean
Where the oxygen exits your lungs and your eyes are explodin'
Whales exhale songs of old
Where the lost pirate gold that an old pirate holds
In his cold dead hands or so I've been told
Still searches for his ship that his shipmates stole, whoah
Land ho, rum barrels and hoes
Crows pickin' eyeballs from the skeleton bones
Trunks full of pieces of eight, beach is in sight
Outlaw types like Edward Teach teaches to fight
Hijack Boston yachts, lick off some shots
And let they bodies sink down, to their lobster pots

I got Sperrys on
(Captain on the deck swabby)
Carry on
Out on Block Island until the very last Ferry's gone

With the whole picture etched in scrimshaw
Pieces of a ripped-up map fit like Jigsaw
Drunk as Scallywags singin' Apathy's joint
Ship docks and find a wife out in Napatree Point
Subterranean, Sonar blip songs from whales
A gun, bottle of rum, and mug full of ale

[Hook: Kappa Gamma]
In the early mornin' sunlight rays of the dawn
Set sail on the sea
Anchors up then Im gone
Skulls on the flag
Blood on my map
With a yo-ho-ho wit' a ho on my lap
Like Hey oh oh oh
Hey oh oh oh
Like Hey oh oh oh
Hey ho oh oh

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Yeah, I make waves move
Like a full moon
I make the ocean rock
Call me Neptune
I scale sand dunes, on a pale beach
Watch the birds flock, where the whales breach
I take money, bury money on deserted islands
I'm perverted smilin'
At Circe and the sirens
I was raised in a village full of violence
Where old blind men seek for shillings with their violins
I'm Leviathan, the ocean that you lyin' in
My posse stay pirating in the waters y'all are piloting
Old ghost tales, ships without a crew
The Flying Dutchman would scare the shit out of you
I throw you off of my schooner without your scooba suit
My ship will loop-the-loop
And find another sloop to loot
Cannon is loaded to shoot
Crew full of criminals
Stranded on an island of savages doin' rituals
Skulls full of soup human heads get shrunk
You can't pay off a cannibal with gold in a trunk
Dead men tell no tales
You'll all get hushed
No parrot on my shoulder cause they talk too much
From a tavern to a cavern where doubloons are kept
I got a very detailed map that shows each step
Which I keep around my neck
Hidden in the medallion
As I write a whole album on a Spanish galleon

[Hook]

[Outro]
In the early mornin' sunlight rays of the dawn
Set sail on the sea
Anchors up then I'm gone
Skulls on the flag
Blood on my map
With a yo-ho-ho with a ho on my lap!
