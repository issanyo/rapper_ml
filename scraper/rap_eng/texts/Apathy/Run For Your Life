[Verse 1: O.C.]
Antarctica Cold while the flow unfolds, listen
While I breath through sixteens and twenty-fours
Rappers I leave froze, suspended in the mist
Of a green glow as if I'm Green Lantern with his ring on
Different dimensions I'm in tune with mind, body and spirit
Which mix would I do? So authentic
I reach deep, pulling out scenes of cinema action and drama
Dark comedy and horror
So long as I'm honest in this world of give and take a change artist
Freeing my words can be cathartic
Bombarded by the image to fit in and get accepted
With honest this game is fickled so shit ain't promised
Best bet to change careers, I'm sort of a seer
At times things are hazy or I see quite clear
To be accepted by my peers nowaday's a pleasure principle so
Pleading the case with no facts is inadmissible

[Hook: Apathy]
You better run for your life
Stay inside at night
You better run for your life
It's the end of the world as you know it

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Walking through the desert, canteens full of gasoline
Makeshift torch fashioned from a fashion magazine
I don't wear that skirt shit, I ain't on some Earth shit
Travel from the further scratches of the universe shit
Greatest rappers ever known until they master how to clone
Electrodes are on my skull, grafts snapping out my dome
I'm R.A.W., Fukushima sushi
The shit I do to groupies is gruesome as horror movies
Talk to me, my language is more ancient than Latin
I'll flatten these suckers rapping like boxers after you packing
A pact of the rap, rattles your dishes up in the cupboard
Discovered I'm so powerful my whole house hovered
Above the ground, about six feet, for like six weeks
You think shit's sweet? I'll sweep the Legoland pipsqueaks
Kublakai nuclear wind and look at the glowing sky
Blowing by the competition, compositions written by the most high

[Hook: Apathy]
You better run for your life
Stay inside at night
You better run for your life
It's the end of the world as you know it
