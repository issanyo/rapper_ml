[Hook]
Please don't take my love away
Break my heart another day
Are you gonna stay or just run, run away?
If you loved me yesterday
I would blow the sun away
So that you would stay, don't run, run away

[Verse One]:
Damn
I've completely lost my cool
Blowin up your phone like a motherfuckin fool
Sweatin little petty things, though they miniscule
Arguing till 5am when you're just tryin to finish school
I've completely lost my mind
If I could travel back in time and tell myself to never mind
And never send a message to ya, if I never did pursue ya
Will I still be brokenhearted or be fine?
It's like I'm completely different
Cause at first I was resistant
But you stayed so damn persistent, now you're actin kinda distant
Wanna send a love letter, tell ya things are gon' get better
I don't mean to put on pressure but
What the fuck's up?

[Hook]
Please don't take my love away
Break my heart another day
Are you gonna stay or just run, run away?
If you loved me yesterday
I would blow the sun away
So that you would stay, don't run, run away

"I get the girlies out on the floor" - Audio 2

[Verse Two]
I used to try to holla at ya, now I only yell at ya
Then I feel like hell after (run, don't away run away)
I used to try to holla at ya, now I only yell at ya
Wanna cast a spell on ya (run, don't away run away)

And your hairs, are everywhere
In my bedroom, in my bathroom, I'mma vaccum up the trash
And 'fore I treat em like a C.S.I Miami, then I bag em
And remember when I grab em and you orgasm "Loving you"
I can't live without ya, I don't think that I know how to
Like my soul's losing power, every second feel like hours
Overload my modem's router, like I'm strung out on that powder
Out in public, yellin louder, I'm addicted, I'm a powder-head
You could fly to Africa, I'mma just come after ya
I travel all over this world, to get my girl
Now I'm tractor beam attracting ya, like Battlestar Galactica
Ya tired of me askin ya
But, what the fuck's up?

[Hook]
Please don't take my love away
Break my heart another day
Are you gonna stay or just run, run away?
If you loved me yesterday
I would blow the sun away
So that you would stay, don't run, run away
