[Hook]
The streets is watching and they talking in the slums
There’s a war going on outside
We roll deep as barbarians (rock, rock on)
We roll deep as barbarians (rock, rock on)
We roll deep as barbarians (rock, rock on)
We roll deep as barbarians (hip hip hip hop)

[Apathy]
We roll deep as barbarians
With weapons more advanced than aliens
Make an incision
With precision of women Cesareans
Carrying bodies and bury 'em
Six feet in the soil
I'm coke wrapped in tin foil, ready to boil
Sprinkle the baking soda now I'm taking it over
Levitatin off the ground like meditatin with Yoda
Medicated like a soldier that's
Back from Iraq
It's epic with efforts and Ap (?)
Like Epitaph raps (?)
With a wrath that'll ripple, wreck it and rock the Earth
Hard as hell like Gargamel got even with(?) Papa Smurf
Drop the verse and little hoes drop they skirts
Ap fans, man, they man probably rock my shirts
And my, jeans are saggin
Rappin like a fire breathing dragon
Beast from the East
Release the Kraken
No peace when I'm packin a piece
My faction is deep
Foot steps fracture the street

[Hook]
The streets is watching and they talking in the slums
There’s a war going on outside
We roll deep as barbarians (rock, rock on)
We roll deep as barbarians (rock, rock on)
We roll deep as barbarians (rock, rock on)
We roll deep as barbarians (hip hip hip hop)

[Verse 2]
Broadcasting from the streets channel 17
News live report Eddie Brock in the sewer dwellers
With Apathy actually lyrically happening
Your faculty tragically killing you drastically
From battlefield casualties
The lyrical monster Godzilla killing impostors
King Kong flyswatter get on choppers
Eating beats like macaroni pasta
We separating real damn Cs from the phony imposters
[?] Prospectors in the building
Negotiate the contracts and I wanna kill him
A sharp shooter from long range like Stephen Curry
Popping middle fingers till your [?] pop fingers
I’m Zeus to immortals I guess I’m a fucking God
Rhymes made of super villain like I’m Michael Todd
Pretty witty your beats are silly like Jim Carrey
Living legendary out of Bakersfield-Curran County

[Hook]
The streets is watching and they talking in the slums
There’s a war going on outside
We roll deep as barbarians (rock, rock on)
We roll deep as barbarians (rock, rock on)
We roll deep as barbarians (rock, rock on)
We roll deep as barbarians (hip hip hip hop)

[Verse 3]
Stick with it
Shoot outs I did it
You don’t wanna be in my shoes you can’t fit it
Dunk every day till I got no limit
Infamous back on the scene of Bruce Willis
A predicate running the streets like two raises major
Killing the haters with good music feeling it
All that weak shit is losing
[inaudible]
While I’m every day a half a G of Brandy
Understand me dugging like
Keep that gap close that shit come in handy
That’s all
Plus part of the room feels cool
Can’t go high with big shoes
You gotta
Haven’t been there in a minute
N*ggas are still trapped
I’m on the map on the top and turning back

[Hook]
The streets is watching and they talking in the slums
There’s a war going on outside
We roll deep as barbarians (rock, rock on)
We roll deep as barbarians (rock, rock on)
We roll deep as barbarians (rock, rock on)
We roll deep as barbarians (hip hip hip hop)

[Outro]
Yo mother fuckers them n*ggas know what’s up man
They rock
The average Eddie Brock Big Twins XP
Fucking wilders
Help the people out
They ain’t ready
Them n*ggas shook man
Hip hop bud
Feel it
