[Verse 1: Apathy]
I'm the boogeyman, Champion hoodie fam
I don't mean to brag but I'm bad to my DNA strand
A warlock readin' spells from a black book
The little boy who played in the kitchen while the crack cook
Study formulas in cocaine chemistry
White trash that collect more cash than Kennedys
Kinetic energy, Connecticut generates
Power a moon base and send a million men to space
I'm a cosmonaut, hard as a Autobot
I'm Doughboy avengin' Ricky's death in the parkin' lot
Ridin' with OGs, the foulest in Cali
Even more wicked and evil than Aleister Crowley
Ask [?] when they put me on
My freestyle flow melts ozone like Freon
Ap's beats make rap radix automatically
Necks snap 'til they back bones shatter from apathy

[Chorus:]
As far as rap go, it's only natural I'll explain
When the missile is aimed, to blow you out of the frame
Heaven and Hell, Rap legend, presence is felt
So why you pushin' me
Rap legend, presence is felt
As far as rap go, it's only natural I'll explain
When the missile is aimed, to blow you out of the frame
Heaven and Hell, Rap legend presence is felt
So why you pushin' me
Rap legend, presence is felt
So why you…

[Verse 2: Apathy]
The eve of destruction, MC's gettin' sucked in
A vortex, overload your cerebral cortex
Sittin' on my porch steps, loadin' mags
To paralyze you crabs or stock up the body bags
I'm cockin' the shotty fast to shatter your body mass
Wanderin' through the woods in hoods and hockey masks
I'm Jason when I'm chasin' you down
Spewin' blood in the mud wit your face in the ground
Roundhouse wack rappers like Swayze in Roadhouse
Doped out to clout, I'll rip your whole soul out
I never ever sold out; Ap's is no cross-over
I lost soldier from the squad of Jehovah
A werewolf that dodges silver bullets
Never fail in reppin' my squadron to the fullest
The G-O-D's, every flow freeze
Like snow on the breeze in zero degrees

[Chorus:]
As far as rap go, it's only natural I'll explain
When the missile is aimed, to blow you out of the frame
Heaven and Hell, Rap legend, presence is felt
So why you pushin' me
Rap legend, presence is felt
As far as rap go, it's only natural I'll explain
When the missile is aimed, to blow you out of the frame
Heaven and Hell, Rap legend presence is felt
So why you pushin' me
Rap legend, presence is felt
So why you…
