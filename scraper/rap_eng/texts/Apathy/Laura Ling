[Chorus] [Apathy]:
Laura Ling
Now that you're free
Come and see a show by the G.B.C
(Laura Ling, Laura Ling, Laura Laura Ling
(Laura Ling, Laura Ling, Laura Laura Ling)
Laura Ling
Now that you're free
Come and see a show by the G.B.C
(Laura Ling, Laura Ling, Laura Laura Ling
(Laura Ling, Laura Ling, Laura Laura Ling)

[Verse One] [Apathy]:
I really wanna see now you're back from Korea
Almost grabbed an Uzi went over and tried to free ya
What's up with your sister?
Say hello to Lisa
We had a pizza party on the day that they released ya
Listen to my speakers
Listen how they boom
I really want a Laura Ling poster in my room
This is Get Busy, we about to make a killin'
Peace to Bill Clinton, Laura Ling's still chillin'

[Ryu]:
Yo, Kim Jong Illin'
Stealin' all our women
Stickin' 'em in prison
Ayo I had a vision
We should go and get 'em, break 'em out on some thug shit
They're probably not allows to listen to Uzi Does It
Everyone's a dick and won't tell her where the club is
North Korea's gotta be the bottom of the fun list

[Laura Ling speaking]:
I just felt like...I had been transported, into a nightmare of a world

[Chorus] [Ryu]:
Laura Ling
Now that you're free
Come and see a show by the G.B.C
(Laura Ling, Laura Ling, Laura Laura Ling
(Laura Ling, Laura Ling, Laura Laura Ling)
Laura Ling
Now that you're free
Come and see a show by the G.B.C
(Laura Ling, Laura Ling, Laura Laura Ling
(Laura Ling, Laura Ling, Laura Laura Ling)

[Laura Ling speaking]:
...I was in another country that considers the United States it's arch enemy. Um, I didn't speak the language and I had no idea, if and when I would ever communicate
