Apathy:
Take you home to your mommy, watch how hard ya family trips
When they see I got you dressing like Vanity Six
A pair of pumps, not Vans four finger rings covering your hands
Makeup’s like you headbutted a box of crayons
It’s true love baby baby give me one more chance
No parachute you rocking Parasuco pants
At first glance, Buffalo stance
And I’m just burning doing the neutron dance
Mami watch how hard ya family trips
When they see I got you dressing like Vanity 6
A pair of pumps, not Vans four finger rings covering your hands
Makeup’s like you headbutted a box of crayons
True love baby baby give me one more chance
Well parachute you rocking Parasuco pants
First glance, Buffalo stance
And I’m just burning doing the neutron dance

Chorus:
I like the way you comb your hair
Uh

Uh

Uh
I like the stylish clothes you wear
Uh
I like the way you comb your hair
Uh
I like the stylish clothes you wear
Uh
I like the way you comb your hair
Uh
I like them stylish clo-I like them stylish clothes

Scoop Deville:
Check check, 1,2,3
Check out the hotel bitch
There’s too many fish in my deep blue sea
So I’m reeling em in I’m as real as can be
Got a lot of hoes on my new shit
Talking about where’d you get the kicks the exclusives?
Shoes stay clean but I'm dirty like a Q-tip
Put it on layaway better yet a swoosh list

RYU:
She likes the way that I move when I moving
Through the room lose your illusion, 808 booming
I’m fly from my Pork pie hat to my shoeses
And I don’t gotta try, I don’t even do shit
I don’t gotta prove it, I just ooze it
Pull a bitch even if she dislikes my music
Understand what you see in me is every girls fantasy
Jimmy Z’s
Lamborghini keys hangin all out of my fuckin jeans
Look at me, look at me I’m everything you want to be
And I don’t mean to brag cuz I know it makes you mad but
If you wanna clash brah, I rock the casbah

Chorus:

Uh
