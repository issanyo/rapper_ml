[Intro]
Vanglorious, sissy
You are now protected by Watson & Holmes

[Verse 1: Blacastan]
Evil fiends roam the block like the puppets in Dark Crystal
You think you watching Transporter how we be sparking pistols
You just cronies, Demigodz is the real Goonies
Back smacking industry cats who try to sue me
For samples that didn't clear
Really we didn't care
Long as what we produced is dope for your ears, cheers
Fill the whole Colosseum as we gladiate
The type of accolades you get when you graduate
Summa cum laude for the bitches like pilates
Pocahontas, she's a hottie-hottie
Rock the body-body
I'm duck hunting, blowing pixels at your TV
Using your wack rap books for tipi
Me - afraid of a mic is like Spider-Man with arachnophobia
Or a dope fiend afraid to shoot the opium up
My rhymes stop animation like Chicken Run
Air block out, even the chicks'll run

[Scratches]
You know the time
Raw shit
You know the deal
We came and went

[Verse 2: Blacastan]
Yo, back in Egypt we formed like an ancient Voltron
Now we return, avenging like the Age of Ultron
This is Gravediggaz with a little bit of Main Source
I slide in the booth like dicks during intercourse
Exposing your tracks like rails with the trains off
Your rhymes are dry like burnt steaks without sauce
(moving on your ass)
Stop, pause, it's Blac, hold the applause, I'm back
Scratching the surface like claws on cats
And while you pop oxys I drop oxymorons in verses
Rhymes so hard my bars need nurses or hearses
Syringe is included with every purchase
Now, measure the odds to make sure that it's worth it
Before jumping through rings of fire at my circus

[Scratches]
You know the time
Raw shit
You know the deal
We came and went

[Verse 3: Apathy]
The big, Christlike
Just the days of Zelda and Excitebikes
First edition Nike Flights, Ataris and Lite-Brites
Gizmo and Spike disintegrated in bright light
I'm biter-proof, ignite the booth and use it as a night light
Night of the Baseheads compared to this taste[?] lead
I'm stingy with the dough, never been known to break bread
AKs and crates, I get fifteen for eight Gs
Negotiate with Lebanese dudes over grape leaves
Your bitch thirsty and slurp me until she get brain freeze
I pop you in Boston and take a train out of Braintree
Back to CT, scot-free like his homebase
The flow makes necks snap back 'til the bone breaks
With Stu in the studio and some old crates pulverized
Get a bullet, surprise, I'm stopping your pulse rate
You pulp fiction hoes overdose and get the needle
Get your people 'cause I'm known to get lethal
Leave you in fetal position
My written craft, it's so fatal to herbs
I got eagles like an Alaskan nature reserve
Check the fine print, industry rules are for the feeble
All hail the sacred beetle when you step in this cathedral
It's a theory that rappers wanna bite when they hear me rap
So clearly that gives me permission to reveal the wack
And peel the cap back, back packs that conceal the gats
Ceilings collapse, feel girdas melt when they feel the tracks

[Outro]
