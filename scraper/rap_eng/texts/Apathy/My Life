[Intro] [Apathy talking]:
What's my life like? Not what the fuck you think. I don't even think your life is what you think

[Verse One] [Apathy]:
It's more groupies and sex than uzi's and tecs
Roll with trash you blow cash on loosies and Becks
I'm the best, flow got effect, roofies and X
On the roof like a rooster, got a rueger and a vest
This ain't easy, it's Eazy-E and Ruthless Wreck
I'm the villain in civilian clothes, few suspect
Keep your G5 faggot and your new bergets
I piss liquid that you could use to fuel your jets
My life is hectic, constantly stressed and shit
Drama pops up when you least expecting it
Life is bitch but I'mma make the best of it
Travel round the world, never trapped in Connecticut
Kids at my shows stand close all stupid stoop
Give me two feet, stay the fuck out my hoola hoop
I never vote cause I know that votes are fixed
Right wing motherfuckers keeping us broke as shit
And don't try to put a microchip in my wrist
I'mma turn psycho, Michael Meyers and slice the shit
So whether I'm wrong or whether I'm right
This is

"My life my life my life my life" - Mary J. Blige

[Hook] [Apathy]:
And they kick me up and they kick me when I'm down
They kick me when I'm up just to keep me on the ground
And they kick me up and they kick me when I'm down
They kick me when I'm up just to keep me on the ground
Whether good, whether bad, sunshine or rain
Middle finger in the air if you feel the same
Middle finger in the air if you feel the same
Middle finger in the air if you feel the same

This is my life
Mind your business bitches
This is my life
Mind your business bitches
Cause his is my life
Mind your business bitches
This is "My life my life my life my life"

[Verse Two] [Optimus Prime]:
Face the facts
It's calculated, words on the wax
I'll make the ground lift and stop a hurricane in it's tracks
I rock a lion's mane surrounded by these snakes and these rats
Walls crumble to the ground when your defenses collapse
Fingers put pens in submission till all paper are tabs
Autobotz unify but wouldn't ?
Perform a seance
Reaching those we lost to mishaps
Tie on my bootstraps, helmets add the booze to my flask
Time is now no DeLorean to visit the past
Till Mics and Daz created jagged crack in the path
Dividing rap in half like math and yell "Hulk smash"
When the crown is blood we'll splash and I split like a gash
Ninja smoke
They lost my whereabouts in a flash
Niggas praying bedside that his movement will last
You know big Op is coming when the water ripples and glass
From vibrations when I walk
Make it past when you science class
But you can keep your ice
It's the Botz and the offspring
Of a god and a human together sicker than gripping these mics
So whether I'm wrong or whether I'm right
Nigga it's...

"My life my life my life my life" - Mary J. Blige

[Hook] [Apathy]:
And they kick me up and they kick me when I'm down
They kick me when I'm up just to keep me on the ground
And they kick me up and they kick me when I'm down
They kick me when I'm up just to keep me on the ground
Whether good, whether bad, sunshine or rain
Middle finger in the air if you feel the same
Middle finger in the air if you feel the same
Middle finger in the air if you feel the same

This is my life
Mind your business bitches
This is my life
Mind your business bitches
Cause his is my life
Mind your business bitches
This is my life
Mind your business bitches
This is "My life my life my life my life"
