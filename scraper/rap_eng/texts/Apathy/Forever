[Intro: Apathy and Illus]
Yea... Apathy, Illus
What's goin' on?
We on some CT shit right now
Yea
Eight-six-oh to two-oh-three
Forever

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Salutations, snatch your mic, bash your face in
Shootin' for the stars with zero calculations
Put away that star map, pull out your hard hat
You don't need a flat tire just to get your car jacked
Ap is on some '91 LA Cube shit
Understandable Smooth, Ras Kass with a toothpick
I'll be here forever, Immortal on the record
I'm Wolverine in the lab, metal injected into my skeleton Highlander gimme the quickenin'
I hold you underwater like a down south christenin'
Listen man, get your body found by a fisherman
Rappers steady sleepin', take it easy on the tryptophan
Watch how I'm movin', study my process
There's bombs buried underneath the basement of projects
Formulas are ancient, too hard to measure
As long as rap's livin' I'll be here forever

[Hook: Apathy]
"We will be here forever, forever"
So as long as the Earth's spinnin', as long as time is measured
"We will be here forever"
"We will be here forever, forever"
So as long as the Earth's spinnin', as long as time is measured
"We will be here forever"

[Verse 2: Illus]
Welcome to the fourth world, land of the new gods
Dismantle your mandible with a fist that's adamantium hard
I'm a cannibal channelin' energy of an Atom Bomb
Devourin' planets like Galactus and Unicron
I'm backpack conscious rap, gangster with a black mac
That'll go pop when I rock, you'll get your neck snapped
I'm hip hop forever, Tougher Than Leather
Altering the weather like the seventh letter
I'm an extraterrestrial with arsenic spit
Call me the demon's head bathin' in a Lazarus pit
I'm too deep for some and too dumb for others
When I speak for the downtrodden sisters and brothers
I'm the voice of the people, positive and negative
Two sides of a coin, connected like a relative
I'm an SP-1200, techniques spinnin'
Since graffiti on the wall documenting it's beginnin'

[Hook: Apathy]
"We will be here forever, forever"
So as long as the Earth's spinnin', as long as time is measured
"We will be here forever"
"We will be here forever, forever"
So as long as the Earth's spinnin', as long as time is measured
"We will be here forever"
