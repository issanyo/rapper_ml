Cuz it’s hurting me so much
So much
So much

You took my love
And now you’re gone
And all I can do
Is sing this song

Cuz it’s hurting me so much
So much
So much
Cuz it’s hurting me so much

Ryu
I said I’d never hurt you like
All the rest of them jerks do I
Said I was different wanted to treat you right
Every thing was the truth except for the lies
I just want to apologize
Uh
For the nights I made you cry
Staying up til 5
Like fuck this guy
Waiting by the phone checking the caller I-D
Couldn’t see it was hurting you inside plus
I was certain that you would never leave my side cuz
Ain’t nobody closer than you and I was
It looked perfect to the naked eye but
On the surface we were inseparable
On the low I was being too sensual
Put myself in a bad position and I did something that I wish I didn’t

Chorus
Cuz it’s hurting me so much
So much
So much
Cuz it’s hurting me so much
So much
So much
Cuz it’s hurting me so much
So much
So much
Cuz it’s hurting

Apathy
Too little too late I know that
You give another chance and I blow that
I know I always say I wish I could go back
Go ahead let it out don’t hold back
So where you gonna go now to your moms house?
Spend the night sheding tears on your moms couch?
Naw don’t bother leaving girl I’m out
And besides you ain’t got no gas money
We wasn’t just summer fun
Girl you’re my number one
So what you running from?
Don’t let us come undone
I know this shit sucks
With things we said and such
You said you hate my gust but I just want to feel your touch

Chorus
Cuz it’s hurting me so much
So much
So so much
Cuz it’s hurting me so much
So much
So so much
Cuz it’s hurting me so much
So much
So so sore
Cuz it’s hurting me so much
