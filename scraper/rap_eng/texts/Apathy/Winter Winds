[Intro:]
And you could smell the city burning
And you could hear the people crying
And then you could see the angels and demons inviting
And you could feel the cold winter winds biting

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Somebody give me a mic, wack rappers better run for they life
You’ll hear thunderin’ like somebody summonin’ poltergeists
Days turn to nights, summers turn in to ice
Every verse that I write, it’s like a furnace ignites
With the snow covered sills in the Bolshevik region
Old women light candles and they pray every evenin’
That on cold dark nights when the winds are freezin’
They could walk through the woods to avoid the demons
Kids throwin’ rocks at the broke-down tanks
Grandfathers fill journals with they memory banks
When his brother went blind cause he stepped on a mine
That got left behind from the Cold War times
Every song, every rhyme, every old wives tale
Every faded photograph that got lost in the mail
Every stew that was brewed to make the bread less stale
When the time felt colder than Siberian jail
Through the rain, through the hail, through the hell on earth
Heart pumps ice water since the day of my birth
From a war torn village where a warrior’s born
In snowstorms keepin' warm in a soldier’s uniform

[Hook x2:]
{"The winter, and I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you’ll enter the winter"}
{"The winter wind"}
{"Cold as the pole in the winter"}

[Verse 2: Marvalyss]
Higher caliber, rattle challengers, check out my algebra
Three-hundred and sixty degrees of molten Metallica
Wizard of poetry, what I’m scriptin’ is potent vocally
Ya folk telekinesis, my thesis chokin’ you openly
Never go toe-to-toe with me, hangin’ from a tabernacle
With rosary, yet torch any rapper who’s standin’ close to me
Curse the Messiah for even provokin’ me
My mental is a third world country
Where the hungry wanderin’ hopelessly
Steamed vegetables, in-credible vocal reach
Beneath the surface where the souls of the servant sleep
Subversively, in the beat of the drum
I talk nice the first time, after that the heaters will come
Knockin’, I cock it, I’m ready to rock it like Janis Joplin
Peel the lymph on ya, Hodgkins, losin’ is not an option
Perestroika salutin’ the cold soldier, bi-polar
I even give my shadow the cold shoulder

[Hook x2:]
{"The winter, and I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you’ll enter the winter"}
{"The winter wind"}
{"Cold as the pole in the winter"}

[Verse 3: O.C.]
Voices be a warnin’ of caution, you got word from a source
That a paranormal force was the cause of the corpses
Yet your first thoughts are folklore
So you try n’ rationalize and dismiss what you seein’ but so far
Deep down inside of ya gut, there’s a feelin’
You can’t dismiss, spirits interact with the livin’
Words come to life, each line very sentence when I pen it
Reconcilin’ my sins through penance
I dare ya’ll to mimic and try n’ dupe what we introduce
Soon enough it spread like a pandemic
It’ll send a chill down ya spine seein’ eyes drip blood like IV’s
Resident Evil in live feed
My criteria storm cold as Siberia
Graphic as a murder caught on video
Rarely seen when I am it’s like the sightin’ of a Sasquatch
Captured by photos on a tripod
The hands of power go unseen
Those involved in this nightmare wish it was a dream
No sleep produce monsters
Have an effect on ya conscious, yet, who’s to blame for the torment?

[Hook x2:]
{"The winter, and I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you’ll enter the winter"}
{"The winter wind"}
{"Cold as the pole in the winter"}
