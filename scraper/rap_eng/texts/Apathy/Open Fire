[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
Yo, It's a fact (yes), I dream of violently stabbin' (yeah)
With an axe, I dream of malicly hackin' (I do)
My elevator don't go to the top floor
I know what a broomstick is, but I don't know what a mop's for (I don't know)
I put bullets in your bulletin (pop pop pop)
So you'll never post that bull again
Eat flesh 'til I'm full again (ahhh)
First you wanted to be Jadakiss
Now I think you wanna be Beyoncé, cause you wanna give Jay a kiss (faggot)
So stop ridin' dick, come up with your own shit
Be like Celph Titled, have original style ownership (uh-huh)
Swing nunchuks at dumb fucks
Pull back the bow on the arrow, send foes to they' peril (yeah)
Saw a hoe bitch, fucked her with a glow stick (bitch)
Left my pubic hairs floatin' in her soapdish (hahaha)
At guided missiles, call me a guidance counselor
Step to the god you'll die, that's the outcome

[Chorus: Redman]
I've had it up to here with ya'll weak-ass rappers
Blazay Blah come through your block and open fire
I've had it up to here with ya'll weak-ass rappers
Blazay Blah come through your block and open fire
I've had it up to here with ya'll weak-ass rappers
Blazay Blah come through your block and open fire
I've had it up to here with ya'll weak-ass rappers
Blazay Blah come through your block and open fire

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
Yo, I'm sick of you fuckboy pop music fans damn it
My brain scans get brain damage
Absolutely terrible, impossible to be managed
Y'all musta lowered your standards and not realize you're dealin' with the man with (what?)
Knives and forks, on weekends you wear biker shorts
Your label ain't backin' you, let's put you on life support (ah)
Flip pies like an acrobatic mathematician
Fuck a Jamaican chick on some cabbage stabbin' shit (wha)
Homie I'm sick continuous like a Möbius strip (dang)
And y'all just some Fruity Pebbles on my grocery list (yeah)
Burger King got Whoppers, McDonalds got Big Macs
I'm robbin' Checkers for Big Bufords with my six shooter
I got a bank for a crib, a house for a bathroom (mm-hmm)
A skank is a bitch with a mouth for a vacuum (shss)
Breakin' out the bad if you front tonight
Stuff a lamp down your throat, how 'bout ya'll try to eat somethin' light?

[Chorus: Redman]
I've had it up to here with ya'll weak-ass rappers
Blazay Blah come through your block and open fire
I've had it up to here with ya'll weak-ass rappers
Blazay Blah come through your block and open fire
I've had it up to here with ya'll weak-ass rappers
Blazay Blah come through your block and open fire
I've had it up to here with ya'll weak-ass rappers
Blazay Blah come through your block and open fire

Blazay Blah come through your block and open fire
Blazay Blah come through your block and open fire
Blazay Blah come through your block and open fire
Blazay Blah come through your block and open fire
