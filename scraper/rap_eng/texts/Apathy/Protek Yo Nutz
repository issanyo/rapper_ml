[Verse One] [Apathy]:
This is the real blueprint
Magic that the legends forgot
Real classic, Ap's back, weapons get cocked
Never passive, scrap till my skeleton drops
Y'all are feminine like you've been taking estrogen shots
Moonwalk over water, touch it, turn it to wine
Better yet spit a rhyme and turn it to turpentine
I'm determined to rid the Earth of these vermin
Virgin Suicides masterbate to dirty versions
Got my ex on X, taking an excursion
Hand scribbles written with precision of a surgeon
In cyphers my verses make you biters nervous
Demigodz roll deep as bikers at Sturgis
The life of the merciless, murderous mercenary
Cemetary scary trying to dig up every verse I bury
A 9mm mic and speaker killer
Who keep more zombies in the street than in Thriller
So name a rapper iller
Name an iller cracker
Name an iller cracker killer, Ap is still the master
Choppin' blow, pocket doe, rocking shows, gotta go
Jump into a bottomless hole yelling "Geronimo"

[Verse Two] [Milez Grimez]:
I love to rap for the love of rap but I get hungry fast
So give up the cash before I have to resort to the gloves and mask
And I don't wanna have to touch your stash
But if I'm starving it could happen in a fucking flash
When you funny cats see Nucks and Aps shut your trap
Or wind up with your face stuck to the pavement smoothered flat
We'll son you faggots worse than your dad when he's drunk and mad
You dummies will be better off inhaling mustard gas
What's with the chit chat? Got a mishap? Then we gonna clash
You might get whiplashed when the kid snaps and erupts on tracks
For the kickback better dip fast before I bust that ass
Or you're gonna get smashed from an impact that's crushing glass
But I ain't come for that
I'm here to cherish what I have
And this rap shit is like my legal way to hustle crack
So I'm bombarding the scene collecting money stacks
We an indestructable team, no one can front on that
I'm a Rotty that's too rowdy to leash
A survivor
You a fraudulent, punany MC
Straight vagina
How you down with the streets?
You a coward who drive around ducking down in your seat
Until you find the police you ain't a rider
You get clowned in the streets
You fags are as sweet as apple cider
A bunch of toddler rappers with pacifiers
You underground as a squad of ? who smashing liars
You wouldn't slap Mariah, stay in your lane before we slash your tires
Ain't no passing by us
Who the fuck is nicer?
Name someone who's liver, you can't cause all of us retired
And we far from tired, I'm wired with tons of fire
That'll dead you bummy biters faster than a Kusty's lighter
We them hungry writers
Beg to differ, than dig a grave
I'm a renegade that's fienda blow quick as a lit grenade
Thinking of different ways to get paid
Cause when I hit the stage you could never...
