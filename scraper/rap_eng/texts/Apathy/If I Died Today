[Verse 1: B-Real]
If I died today, I'd have no regrets
I did what I wanted as I repped my set
I started as a rookie, now I'm one of the best
Only smoking the kush, never fucking with stress
Yeah I travelled the world, steady rocking the masses
And I got you all jumping and you're moving your asses
So when I'm gone, don't scatter my ashes
Just put 'em in a bong, take a hit and pass it
If I had to do it over I would do it the same
'Cause winning and losing is a part of the game
Fuck it
Pass me the Mary Jane
'Cause they don't understand we living off the chain
Live life in the fast lane, back in the day
Didn't care about a fucking thing you had to say
You ever try to test me, go on and pray
Just know that I'm a crazy motherfucker from around the way

[Chorus]
I'm a crazy motherfucker from around the way
I'm a crazy motherfucker
I'm a crazy motherfucker from around the way

[Verse 2: Apathy]
I ain't new school, but too cool to follow them trends
Kinda old school, I paid dues with all of my friends
And I ain't got a mohawk or tight jeans to fit in
Or a fitted with some sticker on the brim, are you kidding?
You couldn't pay me to switch
I rock the craziest kicks
It's like you suckers just discovered that the '80s exist
I take my ladies on trips, on Scandinavian ships
Romantic asshole, like "You looking radiant, bitch"
Try to play me and switch?
I'll introduce your face to my fist
Like bow-bow, 'til your cranium drips
Got valuable phlegm, that's why these people pay me to spit
You trying to question the God? You on some atheist shit?
Well I suggest you drop to your knees and pray to me quick
A.P. exists, even priests play me in whips
It's like puking in public, son, I'm blatantly sick
And there ain't really nothing more to say, that's basically it

[Chorus]
I'm a crazy motherfucker from around the way
I'm a crazy motherfucker
I'm a crazy motherfucker from around the way

[Verse 3: Young De]
I'm in a zone
This right here ain't no clone
I am the originator of what you hear up in these songs
Pocket full of stones, on my U.G.K. shit
Top five, dead or alive, they some of my favorites
And I had to summon all of my patience
'Cause working a 9 to 5 is like a modern-day slave ship
Decided the grave shift is where I make it
So I took it to the pavement and whipped it up like cake mix
You're supposed to speak on, the streets that you be on
But don't talk about what you know, you don't belong
You're still searching for that shoulder to lean on
It's few and far between all the people that you seen fall
Real talk, I'm fresh off tour
Fresh off a whore, that might be yours
I barely remember the night before
When I grip the mic I strike with a lightning force

[Chorus]
I'm a crazy motherfucker from around the way
I'm a crazy motherfucker
I'm a crazy motherfucker from around the way
I'm a crazy motherfucker
I'm a crazy motherfucker
I'm a crazy motherfucker from around the way
