No rapper can rap quite like I can
No rapper can rap quite like I can
No rapper can rap
No rapper can rap
No rapper can rap, can rap, can rap

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I'm like Tyson, way before the tat on his face
A knucklehead punching meteors back into space
Evacuate the Earth, these puny humans in trouble
I'm leaving ruined in rubble, head for the moon on the double
I'm brass-knuckled up, hoody pulled tighter than Elliott
Dippin' quick with E.T. on his bike basket
I like static, mic addict, white magic spells like a sorcerer
Man with the wingspan of the Nemesis Enforcer
I birth rappers, don't bite the hand that feeds you
I'll bite back, I'll eat you, devour and defeat you
I'm lethal with raps, only leave you with scraps
Of the meat that you sink your teeth through
That was Ap's, it's a fact Fuck hoes till they backbones collapse
Who the fuck gassed you up? You's a sucker for snatch
Suffering succotash, motherfuckers is trash
Next time you listen to your buddies, wear a gas mask
What I blast, similar to nuclear waves or atom bomb
Back to the lab, turn rap to ancient Babylon
Sinners can soak in hellfire for treason and these new jacks
Get slapped in they craps for breathing and
It's freezing in the summer, July and June will seem
Colder than night on the dark side of the moon
You collide with a goon who spawned inside a cocoon
Fuck whores inside a saloon, then ride to high noon
Any survivors consumed, or left alive with the fumes
Are liable to be suicidal, left inside of a tomb
You should stay off the mic, stick to being a fan
Cause no rapper can rap quite like I can

[Hook x3: LL Cool J]
No rapper can rap quite like I can
No rapper can rap quite like I can
No rapper can rap
No rapper can rap
No rapper can rap, can rap, can rap

[Verse 2: Apathy]
I'm a bionic commando, rocking metal gear
Find me in the studio with a dead engineer
And I'll never shed a tear for the shit I shouldn't had did
Shatter bones when I shove a shank into your ribs
I'm the lord of the rings, four fingers and brass knuckles
Walking on the surface of Saturn, breathing gas bubbles
Heavy ammunition, I'm a powerful magician
And someone's a demon when four moons are in position
I'll be cocking back a cannon that mechanically links
With an army rolling deeper than the Gramercy Riffs
Separate fact from myth, word, Ap is the shit
Suckers get lit, jugulars slit, I'm running this shit
I'm rep-killing suckers from Tokyo to Temecula
Rocking my competitors to knock 'em out this nebula
I can assemble several metal weapons in seven seconds
Set 'em up to puncture while you pumping Evanescence
Rappers get soft every second, so I ain't sweating y'all
Flows I compose stay flammable as ethanol
So on Friday I'm practicing gunplay
Playing Rebecca Black backwards to Black Sunday
Ready to rip, we're rapping the repetition
I'm dope, the definition of death and demolition
Priests get premonitions and pray
They not praying, it's peace
Cause A-P is a beast, I don't play
Way too forty I kill rappers in my way
Swear to God 99% of new jacks are gay
With they nerdy-ass voice and they little frat flow
Rip they soul out they throat, throw it through a black hole
I blackout, pack backpacks with black pistols
Leave you shook as criminals seeing the bat signal
So fall the fuck back, stick to being a fan
Cause no rapper can rap quite like I can

[Hook x3: LL Cool J]
No rapper can rap quite like I can
No rapper can rap quite like I can
No rapper can rap
No rapper can rap
No rapper can rap, can rap, can rap
