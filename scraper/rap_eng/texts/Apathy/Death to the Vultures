[Intro]
Yeah,Apathy screaming Death to these culture vultures
Hehehe.. I shouldn't give a fuck right ?
It's a bad look, but what's worse ?
Saying something that I know Is right
Or not saying nothing, When these fucking clowns
Disrespect who you love, Who's a sucker then ?

[Refrain]
I do this for my culture
To my very last breath
[2x]Screaming death to the culture vultures
Screaming death to the ...

[Verse 1: Apathy]
For all the dues I pay
For all the crews I slay
For all the fights I've fought
For all the mics I've rocked
For every crate I carry
Every rapper I bury
Every rapper that I love is lying in the cemetery
Every dollar I spent, and every night I went hungry
'Cos I've bought rap albums when I saved my lunch money
Every time I had a memory attached to a song
Soundtrack to my life, thank God this is long
Every song I dedicated that got me some ass
And for the walkman in my back that always got me through class
This is for my squad, Demigodz for life
I wouldn't even be here if It wasn't for Open Mic
And if it wasn't for Celph and me and Louie out in Harlem
I sacrifice my life with a mic, not for stardom
Every rhyme I wrote and note books I filled
MC's I killed, Studios I've chilled
Every time I billed with dudes who I look up to
For those who fronted, fuck you, I could probably crush you
This is for the underdogs and underachievers
For all my blown speakers, the amps and receivers
An addict for sneakers
This Is for all the professors and teachers
Consider that as a death threat for vultures and leeches
Nas verses that sound like Malcolm X speeches
And every corner of the planet that this Rap reaches

[Refrain]
I do this for my culture to my very last breath
[3x]Screaming death to the culture vultures
I do this for my culture to my very last breath
[3x]Screaming death to the culture vultures

[Verse 2:Apathy]
For every sucker I diss to dismiss
Now they cease to exist
For the clones that I've crushed
Turn they bones into dust
For the snakes who deceive
And I ain't even believe
All of the swagger they leave
I'm brushing off of my sleeves
For the tapes I wore out, with all the titles rubbed off
For these vultures, they soft
Tell the fakes to fuck off
For all the cyphers where I've stood
And every borough and hood
And for the freestyles I kicked to show them rappers was good
And If you counted all the notebooks I purchased
To scribble these verses
You could probably cover the Earth's surface
For miles on the whip, all the styles I've flipped
For all the talk behind my back with the smiles I get Cause I really pay dues, fuck YouTube views And if I keep killing mics, I know I never lose
For the fans, for my fam, for the man I am
Pan Ams to Japan, suitcase in my hand
For Connecticut, I had to put my state on the map
And for these fuckers trying to take rap, I'm taking it back
For the posters on my wall, magazines I cop
12 inches I drop in Long Island's cop shop
For them Nike sneakers For those nights staying out past curfew with Jerk Crew
Knowing if you get caught your parents'll hurt you
For these motherfucking vampires sucking us dry
I hope you choke on a dick and get nut in your eye, bitch

[Refrain]
I do this for my culture to my very last breath
[3x]Screaming death to the culture vultures
I do this for my culture to my very last breath
[3x]Screaming death to the culture vultures

[Outro]
