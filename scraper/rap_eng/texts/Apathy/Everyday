[Intro: Apathy]
Everyday that he wakes up just seems closer to death
That's a mystic, stress is wicked, feels like there's nothing left

[Hook]
He eats the same shit
Driving to work in the same whip
Works all week for the same chips
Sliding his dick in the same bitch
Every month, every week, everyday
[Verse1: Apathy]
There is no escape
Keep on going until your soul will break
Bald, out of shape and overweight
Now is the time to motivate
Drive home pump the shit
Dump your bitch
Get a new chick, strictly fuck buddy shit
Call work up and quit "What the flip?"
"Fuck off!" Tell your boss to, "Suck a dick!"
Now you searched on the net for a person to sex
You're rehearsing your best game flirt to impress
She arrives at 9 when the doorbell chimes
It blows your mind homegirls actually fine
[Verse2: Apathy]
As you climb off top of this girl
You're on top of your game
On top of the world
Go back to your old job, not for respect
Or to get your old job back for the last check
As you walk through the office you manage to pass all
The desk occupied by this manager asshole
The mug sitting on it says, "#1 Father"
The picture beside it is probably his daughter
Nah. It can't be. What? Damn, is that right?
His daughter is the girl you fucked last night?
That's amazing! What a coincidence
Funny how incidence like this ruin girl's innocence
If he knew what he held so sacred
Had been desecrated he would be filled with hatred
Probably wanna hang himself in the basement
Instead of trying to face it
Thank God you taped it
Tomorrow won't be so average
Cause he's gonna get a real special package
And it really won't matter the amount
Cause you sent it out underneath the company's account
