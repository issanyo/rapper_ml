[Verse One]
Saturday night
The night life scene is wild
Profile with fly chicks, kicking game with a smile
I'm a black belt with bitches, undefeatable style
Mathematics in the palm pilot, add it to the file
Skeptical when the sexual vibes are too incredible
My plan is to examine her, scan her intellectual
"Nice Gucci glasses" "Thank you"
"You still go to school?" "Yep"
"Got plans for the future? Oh you major in computers?"
You're a dime piece a fine piece of feminine specimen
The type that got me nervous and boost my adrenaline
Let's go back to my crib and celebrate your estrogen
Fiesta till we siesta like we're Mexican
You've only been with one man? Nah, I don't buy it
You're correct in the mental and resemble Salma Hayek
I can't lie, you're fly and I'd die to try it
Dive it in, but wait a minute, before I work it
I need the prophylactic, plastic when I tap it
She really bugged me out when I saw how she reacted
See everything could've been perfect with the safe sex
But she hates the feeling like "I'm allergic to latex."
Never ever would I touch it, fuck it or lick it
If she's raw every time she's letting other motherfucker's hit it
My vibe was dead, she laid on the bed
Slowly lifted up her head and this is what she said
"When you give it to me, yeah, give it to me raw" - Method Man 'Bring The Pain'
What?
"When you give it to me, yeah, give it to me raw"
Huh?
"When you give it to me, yeah, give it to me raw"
Ayo fuck that, I'm out the front door you whore

Back in the action, relaxing in the Accura, macking this mami
In a Maxima, asking if Ap was a rapper, I'm like "Word
I met you at a show several months ago
You and this other ho asking if I had some blunts to roll."
I didn't say "ho" she prolly would've flipped
I was slick, replaced the word "ho" with "Bitch!"
Gave her compliments
I could tell she was feeling my confidence
Pompous, I pump my CD's like P.D.'s
My smooth game had her brain in a deep freeze
My beats knocked on this busy little sweet block
Where cats keep the heat cocked, it seemed cinematic
Or poetry in motion, classic as Illmatic
Like old jazz wax with dirty pops of static
The club just closed so I'm suck up in the traffic
(Saturday night)
Girls flaunt feminine fat
(Saturday night)
Wack cats think they can rap
(Saturday night)
I'm on a strict mission to bone
(Saturday night)
I'm not going home alone
My phone's on roam, leave the message after the tone
And I'mma check my voice mail once I'm in the calling zone
I'm up in Bill's Bar with this thick ho
Get her drunk, bring her home, show her with the dick go
Take this little nypho from up outta the disco
While 7L & Esoteric was up on stage sipping Hypno
