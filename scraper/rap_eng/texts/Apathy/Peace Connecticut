[Verse 1: Apathy]
I'm on my CT shit, but when ain't I?
I've been repping this shit since I was yay high
I'm from heroin town, yeah I was born there
Check the location on my Foursquare, junkies and whores there
Hartford and New Haven's like warfare, these days
Channel three news with the replays
Where the body decays, white trash free base
Plus we the home of slept on rappers and DJ's
Big Mike put me up on his tapes, for how I'm repping this state
Not because I drop papes, yeah my name holds weight
This is just a reminder from the state where we call subs and heroes grinders
It reminds me of '95 in the pathfinder
Playin Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, or Da Beatminerz
Well Evil Dee broke me off lovely, it's ugly
Shout out to all the UConn Huskies
I'm a CT

[Chorus: Raekwon]
Peace, Connecticut, peace, Connecticut
Peace, Connecticut, real niggas lick shots, peace, Connecticut
Peace, Connecticut, peace, Connecticut
Peace, Connecticut, real niggas lick shots, peace, Connecticut

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Yo, I'm a young man, with an old soul
I'm from where Good Ole Tom will buy your old gold
Shout out to Stezo, peace to Dooley-O
And Chris Webby gettin' busy in the studio
I'm doe raker with my motherfucking Spliff and Mo'
And got my North Face on son, it's wicked cold
I'm New England like a mothafucka', turn turn it up louda'
We export more white powder than clam chowder
An epic beast rep the streets where they sayin' F police
Sitting in this interview with my man Kevin Reese
I'm a product of Dock 9, it's classic
In case you didn't know he's Connecticut's Mr. Magic
If you all want problems, then here comes trouble
That's why I got "Connecticut" tatted above my knuckles
Peace to all my people, chillin' in Willirico
And chicks on the Metro North, strapped with Kilos and CT

[Chorus: Raekwon]
Peace, Connecticut, peace, Connecticut
Peace, Connecticut, real niggas lick shots, peace, Connecticut
Peace, Connecticut, peace, Connecticut
Peace, Connecticut, real niggas lick shots, peace, Connecticut
