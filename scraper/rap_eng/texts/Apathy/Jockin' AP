[Hook]:
I see you jockin' AP, jockin' AP
You boy flows so fresh

[Verse One]:
Ap to Earth
Is it worth my time?
To come back down to Earth, spit a verse spit a rhyme
This is sample simple rappers, one at a time
Dissect them with a scaple cut 'em line by line
Like coke on a mirror, could I make it any clearer?
Mind's stronger than Akira, you're cheaper than Ikea
I see ya right there, wait, here's an idea
Disappear 'fore any dental records to ID ya
I fear no man, I'm savage as Conan
Got barbaric raps and axe in both hands
If you're bluer than a Smurf or red as a Coke can
This is rap so adapt, be a fucking grown man
Now led me your ear before I end your career
I've been killing MCs since Pepsi was clear
Since Gretsky and Jordan and Jackson had a cartoon
Ap's the truth, ain't no use in argueing

[Hook]:
I see you jockin' AP, jockin' AP
You boy flows so fresh

[Verse Two]:
Mike put me on the mic it seemed like the right time
Like fights over Nikes, this is white on white crime
I ain't even at my prime even though I'm 29
I'm nine million times better than when I was signed
I'm out of my fucking mind bitch, Ap's the answer
I'm the bumble bees knees, I'm the cat's pajamas
If you claim to be the best or the greatest
Then I must be something you can't even say in the human language
Interstellar, best seller, kicking accapellas
So hot I cool off with helicopter propellers
Your shit is crazy
When they play me
People ask, "Who turned on the AC?"
Cause my flows so cold, that your lady
Got her nipples hard listening to AP
Life's A Bitch and you can ask AZ
That's why most of my people stay hazy
All them rappers like, "Ap why your flow so immaculate?"
"Cause I like rapping bitch"
And I'm way way way above average
College kids study Ap with graphs and grids

[Hook]:
I see you jockin' AP, jockin' AP
You boy flows so fresh
