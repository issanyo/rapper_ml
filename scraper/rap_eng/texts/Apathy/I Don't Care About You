RYU:
Stop blowing up my fucking phone

[Verse 1: Apathy]
So love me
Or leave me
No biggie
Believe me
You act up
I pack up
We're too torn
To patch up
And that sucks
I move on
Doing good
With you gone
I’m too fly
To just die
Wipe that hate
From your eye

Chorus:
And should I change my number or move real far
Because no matter where I go it’s like there you are
And should I be a paranoid have to watch my back
Because a ps-ps-psycho like you don’t know how to act
Because I-I-I-I-I-I-I don’t care about
You ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh no more
And no I-I-I-I-I-I-I don’t care about
You ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh no more
Cuz I’m free, tes I’m free
To do whatever ever ever I want right now
Yes I’m free, yes I’m free
To do whatever ever ever I want right now
Yes I’m free

[Verse 2: RYU]
All the drugs
In your nose
All the blood
On my clothes
I don’t know
Where you went
But you’ll be back again
All the time
That you spent
Snorting blow
Having sex
You’re a ho
Heaven knows
That I ain’t having it
In your eyes
I see the devil in ‘em
In your eyes
Is my dilemma

Chorus:
Should I change my number or move real far
Because no matter where I go it’s like there you are
And should I be a paranoid have to watch my back
Because a ps-ps-psycho like you don’t know how to act
Because I-I-I-I-I-I-I don’t care about
You ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh no more
And no I-I-I-I-I-I-I don’t care about
You ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh no more
Cuz I’m free, yes I’m free
To do whatever ever ever I want right now
Yes I’m free, yes I’m free
To do whatever ever ever I want right now
Yes I’m free

2Tone:
In the city of angels
Our story begins
We hide behind halos
To mask our sins
Is this true love?
Is this true love?
Is this true love?
Is this true love?

[Verse 3: Scoop Deville]
You call me
Page me
Text me
You crazy
I’m no good
I’m lazy
Well peace then
I’m Swayze
You love me
You hate me
You’re bullshit
Don’t phase me
My ex girl
My lady
I’m not so sure lately

Chorus
Because I-I-I-I-I-I-I don’t care about
You ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh no more
And no I-I-I-I-I-I-I don’t care about
You ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh no more
Cuz I’m free
Yes I’m free
To do whatever ever ever I want right now
Yes I’m free
Yes I’m free
To do whatever ever ever I want right now
Yes I’m free
Yes I’m free
Yes I’m free
