"It's a day to be long remembered...
A day of hope for peace...and justice throughout the galaxy"

[Verse 1]
Defeating evil foes, Silver Surfin' through the galaxy
Battling wack emcees, (Da da da!) Super Apathy
Traveling at the speed of light, no destination planned
Intergalactic superpowers pulsating through my hand
Switch my focus to my enemy, plotting devastation
[Clear the mind, clear the soul] before engaging confrontation
Place my fist upon my chest to summon superpowers
I tower over everybody, adversaries cower
I turn green, no wait a minute, red...fuck it, I'm blue
With my sidekick, no fuck that too, my superhuman crew
Demigodz, throwing lightning rods of energy on your planet
Crushing granite rocks eating cinder blocks like sandwiches
Lighting candlesticks with laser rays from my eyes
Speeding faster than a bullet streaking through the skies
All my foes despise the ways of the immortal
Half man and half amazin', traveling through my mystic portal

[Hook] (2X]
I'm tryin' to tell these evildoers, crime don't pay
Do your thing, I'll do mine kid, stay outta my way
I gotta make the planet safer for our children to play
So your hero's on his way..."Here I come to save the day" [- Method Man

[Verse 2]
Now that the streets are darker, I be takin' suckas out like Peter Parker
Web slingin', heads spinnin', powers got me speakin' harder
Spider Sense tinglin', we're minglin' in clubs
Where the thugs wanna fill a superhuman with slugs
I save bitches from the tracks where the Amtraks pass
And I'm guaranteed ass for a peek under the mask
There's no...S on my chest, it's a capital A
From day to day I make the streets safe for children to play
Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, it's...
The superhero who spits and splits entire planets
Never crippled by Kryptonite mics, I have no weakness
When we're pumped out of the speakers, evildoers can't defeat us
My super strength breaks backs of weak little hoes
So I'm on a search for Superwomen, like Lil' Mo
And if I miss savin' the city cause I was rehearsin' rhymes
I'll fly around the Earth backwards, 'till I reverse time, and save the day

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fuck a phone booth, in vocals booths I change at the speed of light
No cape and tights, strictly hooded sweats and uptown Nikes
My nemeses are feminists who fight for women's rights
By my eyesight can see through bitches frontin' like they ain't dykes
No psychokinesis for fight increases, my speech is lethal
To feeble evil people I'm stabbin' with turntable needles
I'll hit your block and be the hero that your crew jocks
I'll transform like Laserbeak and sleep inside a boombox
I'll join a superhero group and show 'em how it's done
Turn the Fantastic Four to Funky Four Plus One
Cock the hammer of the godz like I'm Thor with a gun
And fight Professor X and start a mutant war with my tongue
And as long as this little planet Earth'll orbit the sun
Villains'll feel the force from their lungs, and forfeit and run
The Demigodz never play, we're on the job every day
And when a scream for help is heard, it's up, up, and away!

[Hook]
