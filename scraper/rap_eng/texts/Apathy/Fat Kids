[Verse 1]
Could I get two of those
Oh shit my bad
I love you like a fat kid love cake
I met this bitch named Little Debbie
As soon as we hung out
It took about a week or less and I was all strung out
In the beginning I was stressing till the stress and all the pressure
From my high blood pressure had me sitting on a stretcher
I ignored every lecture from my doctor Dr. Pepper
Wrote a letter said she’d kill me if I let her just forget it
Better day made me meditate chill and get your head straight
Overweight fatter than fuck
It’s dead weight
Fucking fat kids
As long as the food warm I’ll be eating it like it’s pussy
And calling it food porn
I don’t fuck with Wheaties
I only fuck with Reese’s
Now I’m fucked fucking with the dough
Diabetes
It’s like crack
Snacks are like smack
My arteries are hardening
And starting a heart attack
You are what you eat
High fructose sweet drinks
Soda by the two liter
Five times a week

[Hook]
I love you like a fat kid loves cake
With french fries in my face
Till my waistline breaks it’s like
I love you like a fat kid love cake
I’ll eat a steak lick the plate and wash it down with a shake with y’all
I love you like a fat kid loves cake
For every cookie that you bake I do whatever it takes I’m saying
I love you like a fat kid loves cake
For God’s sake someone please show me how to escape it’s like

[Verse 2]
Excuse me can you move over a bit
So I can have a seat
You’re occupying two spaces
You’re fucking obese
You got a whole meal stuck in one of your teeth
You walk less than a block of the street and start to breathe hard
You live at the buffet even got a VIP card
We in the restaurant patiently waiting
While you sitting at the next table hungrily salivating
Cranky like a crack addict fiending for food
It’s funny how that fructose can change a n*gga mood
If it seems I’m being rude
I was that dude
That I’m describing in the song with a lust for food
When I stopped eating meat
Y’all said that was whack
But I never judged when you was popping Pop-Tarts like crack
And if you’re black you know there’s certain things that’s hereditary
And what you eat can send that ass to the cemetery
Reality check
We living in the fattest nation

[Hook]
I love you like a fat kid loves cake
With french fries in my face
Till my waistline breaks it’s like
I love you like a fat kid love cake
I’ll eat a steak lick the plate and wash it down with a shake with y’all
I love you like a fat kid loves cake
For every cookie that you bake I do whatever it takes I’m saying
I love you like a fat kid loves cake
For God’s sake someone please show me how to escape

[Verse 3]
I used to say I was dying
I was taking my time
I was busy eating piece of pizza beef and gravy and fries
The vacant was mine at the drive thru
First place in the line
I changed my mind
I don’t need no bakerers crying
I mean I’m eating a feast could even be brown meat
Liquor fucking up my liver
Cuz the scene was rowdy
Which in return only turned into more calories
Someone’s cooking pounds of burgers on their balcony
I don’t order one of everything whenever I go out to eat
Blow my loot on grocery  shopping like I got two mouths to feed
Until that day came it started catching up to me
No more drinking pop super sizing living luxury
I got the diabetes from the snacks in my gut
I shed it off and then it was dope cuz I can actually fuck
What I’m saying is relax when you’re looking at that menu
Or else you’ll have to take a shit pushing through a test tube
Gross
This shit is gross

[Hook]
That’s why I love you like a fat kid loves cake
With french fries in my face
Till my waistline breaks it’s like
I love you like a fat kid love cake
I’ll eat a steak lick the plate and wash it down with a shake with y’all
I love you like a fat kid loves cake
For every cookie that you bake I do whatever it takes I’m saying
I love you like a fat kid loves cake
For God’s sake someone please show me how to escape it’s like
