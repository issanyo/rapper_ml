[Hook: Apathy]
Old BMWs, no registration
Trap phones thrown away, no hesitation
School drop out hard knock education
On the block all night true dedication
I swear its like I'm living in Hell
"Life is Hell"
It's like I was raised in Hell
"Life is Hell"
I swear it's like I'm living in Hell
"But as the world turns I learned life is Hell"

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Hard body like auto bots
I autographed epitaphs overloading electroencephalographs
Do the math, I'm Rainman with tooth picks
Minnesota Fats with pool sticks, I bruise shit
Slick Rick ruler status in your stratosphere
Strap your body down to a stretcher whenever Ap appear
You told your friends you about to end my career
Yeah, like the Mayans ended Earth last year
I pap smear pussy rappers reducing humans to molecules
Not an illusion I always do the impossible,
All you Lil' Wayne fans need a brain-scan
Make you disappear like quarters in David Blaine's hand,
I love bass-tapes, DJ Magic Mike
You're the faggot type who love the movie Magic Mike
You little bums rocking old ass Sean John
My flows cold make you sleep inside of a TaunTaun

Old BMWs no registration

It's like I was raised in Hell
"Life is Hell"
I swear it's like I'm living in Hell
"But as the world turns I learned life is Hell"

[Verse 2: Hayze]
Work in a duffle, strolling
Niggas see me, they say, "Damn, you always smoking"
Signed overnight, right?,
Why you think they chose him?
Probably because my voice and complexion is golden
The lectures is potent
And I ain't even 24 yet
There's 33 strategies niggas better forfeit
Tell them we could bang it out, shoot it or fist
Be the creeps some dykes, bikers and 20 war vets at your doorstep
Because warriors don't ignore shit
Beat you pussies redder than a sore clit,
Flows get them sick
Songs leave them nauseous
Get you high quicker than niggas picking abortions
Over raising they seeds is pretty basic
See, if we had to choose who it was blatantly me that's winning
Can't nobody else fuck with us, no discussion bruh
Love and lust, get money and fuck sluts
What up
