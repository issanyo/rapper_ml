[Intro]: Apathy
It’s time time
Tell you how I feel about you
Cuz I been thinking
Thinking alot lately
You hear that girl?
That’s the sound of me ripping up all them other girls numbers

[Hook]
Diamonds in your eyes
Heart of gold
Pussy made of platinum
Have you ever been told?
That you got
Diamonds in your eyes
Heart of gold
Pussy made of platinum
Have you ever been told?

[Verse One]: Apathy
I don’t even fuckin sing girl
But I’ll do my fuckin thing girl
To pull them panties off your pussy
I’ll admit it won’t just hit it and quit it
Give you a ring girl
And you ran on my mind
And you looking so fine
On a scale of 1 to 10
Even if you ain’t a 10
Girl at least you is a 9

[Hook]

[Verse Two]: Ryu
Shama lama lama
Turn around and let me see ya little bottom
Baby got a little booty and I want it
For a minute
Let me get up and I’ll hit it like I’m Riddick Bowe
Punch
I ain’t got a big dick but I got a whole
Bunch of this and that
Pussy plat-num and a heart of gold
You want to hold
I’ll get you in the bed and I bet
You could suck on balls through a garden hose
Jump on it
Jump on it
Jump on it if you want it
Round the clock rock solid put my hot dog in ya donut
Hop on it
Hop on it
Hop on it if you want it
Round the clock rock solid put my hot dog in ya donut

[Hook]
