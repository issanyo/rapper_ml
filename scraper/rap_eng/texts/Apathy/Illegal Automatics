[Verse 1: Blacastan]
All hail the golden ax, Excalibur
Dollars in the swollen sack, rap Metallica
Believe me yo, the Godz is back
Throw daggers through your fraudulent facades and acts, marathon tracks
Blade Runners, rock Cazal shades all summer
Foul ball bunters throw grenades through your Hummer
Your foul baby mother grip pipes like a plummer
Incredible, her favorite vegetable is cucumbers
Black Sabbath, smolderin' pots of black magic
Murder tracks savage, none of y'all can't match it
Jason Voorhees sinkin' y'all with the hatchet
John Wayne-Max Payne squeezin' the ratchets
Squeeze semen in rap chicks, how sleazy is that shit?
Greasy as rat shit in a project cabinet
Crush faggots in fragments, flip crosses on Catholics (gun fire)
While I'm loadin' up illegal automatics, word

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Arms spread wide like Jesus Christ wingspan
Spikes through my pimp hand, sixteen for six grand
Triple six, sickle cell, bored of Heaven, sick of Hell
Poison reservoirs, spit in foods plus I piss in wells
Kiss or tell, fuckin' brag, ain't no rapper touchin' Chad
Highlander shit, broadsword inside my duffel bag
Ap is the man bangin' hoes, you're a fuckin' fag
Fruitcake, jerkin' off to muscle men in muscle mags
Muzzle on the musket, now I'm dustin' off the Desert Eagle
Leaving 'em in fetal positions, stuck with a record needle
Need to kneel before the king or wield a sword or shield
Or force field a record deal and a skeleton made of steel
Cash plus a beat, this is classic as Mass Appeal
A mask and a gold grill and a vat is some Massengill
I'm mass at the Vatican, a mad man with a MAC-10
A notebook and a black pen and throat full of acid phlegm
