[Intro]
This is the part that the DJ will keep bringing back

[Hook]
Everybody wanna have a good time but you don't
Any ?? in your mind and you won't
What can you do if you want to and they don't

[Verse One]
Your persona
Bad mama
Kill Bill, Black Mamba
Turn around, put it down, lay a little smack on her
Wow
Impressed how the ass is so fat on her
Analyst the rest and there's really not fat on her
But, it really shouldn't even be a factor
When the fact is, her face is fly as Cleopatra
Go back to her place, throw her back out of place
Back out the back door, back the whip out the space
Back to the spot
Laugh about the ass I got
To my man who looks higher than an astronaut
And when I break down the story, I'm bragging a lot
Soooo
Half of it's true and half of it's not
Around 3:00 dudes scoop girls even if they ugly
The rest of the crew, slightly bent and hungry
Motherfuckers are wildin' all pumped and violent
Girls are drunk dialing, all dumb and smiling
Conversing with exes and end up crying
That's when I slide in, I got it down to science
Everybody's just tryin' to have a good time
But some of y'all act like you lost your mind
Cause

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
When the sun goes down and the freaks come out
You'll probably put 'em to sleep if the beats don't bounce
Got 'em coming out they house, words comin' out they mouth
Like, "Hey, this is that song I was tellin' about."
Got 'em puttin' on they lipstick, pushin' up they bras
The second that the shit hit, droppin' they drawers
Stickin' out they tongue, fantasizing for yours
Insecure in the mirror, analyzing they flaws
Roundin' up they homegirls, think they rule the whole world
Lookin' at you like, "yeah we do"
"Oh you think you fly?"
"Yeah we do"
"Well I can't even lie"
"Yeah, me too"
But the way that you're actin'
You're fuckin' up my high
The way that it happened
You're fuckin' up my high
Yeah you're tryin' to react
You're fuckin' up my high
Bouncers holdin' you back
You're fuckin' up my high

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
It's funny how these dudes disrespect it inside
And to be honest, I'm kinda sick of lettin' it slide
Runnin' around throwin' out this little negative vibe
But when it comes down to it, you jet in your ride
Outside let your anger vent
You must be bent, you ain't 50% of 50 Cent
It's not in your character
Nobody's scared of ya
Settle the fuck down before we embarrass ya
But the way that you're actin'
You're fuckin' up my high
The way that it happened
You're fuckin' up my high
Yeah you're tryin' to react
You're fuckin' up my high
With bouncers holdin' you back
You're fuckin' up my high
