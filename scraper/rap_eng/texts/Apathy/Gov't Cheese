[Verse: Apathy]
I used to love government cheese, we lived in a shitty house
I grew up around coke like you grew up around Mickey Mouse
The mirrors had residue, my clothes were second-hand
We had no revenue, my kicks were pathetic man
Destroyed competitors, show off to show em up
Treat Challengers like '86, and blow em up
Growing up like I had Turrets, flows erupt
When nobody expects, it upset the grownups
Scatterbrain, rap playin' in my JVC
Now it's ADD in the place to be
Ritalin pills from nurses were fucking up my verses
I hid it under my tongue, and spit it in my thermos
The one man circus whose perfect on purpose
The perks of perfection is never being nervous
I'm flawless, the rawest, the savage be cautious
Disastrous, Catholics, grab on your crosses
I'm godless, agnostic, narcissist, sharp witted
Fit it split half cause I'm gassed on my own did-dick
Ap spit it, that shit is, arsenic, acidic
Apathetic's deadly as the crack epidemic
Demigod demolitionists, so don't get ridiculous
I fuck you in front of crowds like sex exhibitionists
High pose, fly clothes, now I can afford 'em
While you be buying bootleg Jordans down on Fordham
