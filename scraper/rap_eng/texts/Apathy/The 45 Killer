[Intro: Sample]
Check it, loop a funky 45, and I'll wreck it
Check it, loop a funky 45, and I'll wreck it
Check it, loop a funky 45, and I'll wreck it
Check it, loop a funky 45, and I'll wreck it
Check it, loop a funky 45, and I'll wreck it
Check it, loop a funky 45, and I'll wreck it
Check it, loop a funky 45, and I'll wreck it

[Verse 1: Apathy]
The radio ain't a factor, to a radioactive rapper
I send your soul shootin' through the sky like the rapture
I could put racks on the fact that y'all are wacker
The facts are I'm faster than Bruce Lee's master
I'll mash ya, I'm massive, disastrous massacre
I'm sorry there just ain't another cracker of my caliber
Excalibur, I'm Merlin with evil spells swirlin'
Inside a boiling cauldron, use caution 'cause I'm hurling
Stones and rocks in homes and yachts, telephone poles and blocks
With strength of a hurricane that drops a gazillion megawatts of electrical shots
I'm so exceptional, the skeptical just shut up and watch
Y'all are fronting like your bosses, your business is all week
You little dudes are way more Walmart than Wall Street
The all-seeing eye, seventh letter, whatever you call 'em
The 33 vertebrae inside of your spinal column
Shoot a million future Messiahs inside of a condom
And shoot a million more at the bottom of hoes when I drop 'em
To their knees like followers, dropped at the feet of Christ
Need advice, drop the mic, it'll probably save your life
Take a hike, we ain't alike, it's serious day and night
To put meat in front of a shark and expectin' him not to bite
Brighten up, y'all emotional bitches should lighten up
Motherfuckers get gassed, so naturally I light 'em up

[Scratch Hook: Sample]
Check it, loop a funky 45, and I'll wreck it
I'm not your average MC with the Joe Schmoe flow
Check it, loop a funky 45, and I'll wreck it
Skilled in the trade of that old boom bap
Check it, loop a funky 45, and I'll wreck it
If you don't know me by now, you'll never know
I can kick a rhyme over ill drum rolls
With a kick, snare, kicks and high hat

[Verse 2: Apathy]
I'm a bad man, take an aluminum bat to Batman
And backhand the nurse, then autograph the CAT Scan
No pulse, flat line when Ap rhyme, it's halftime
Rappers talk back, get a cracked spine
Only a face that a mother could love
I slap the soul out your body, let it hover above
.45 caliber killer, blood spiller, vanilla ape
Sleep is the cousin of death, so I'm still awake
Facilitate rappers who appear to have a death wish
I'm Hell's biggest promoter, I'll throw you on the guest list
Nobody's schoolin' me, even rappers that's cool with me
It's like they drained the blood from my veins and put jet fuel in me
Your tomfoolery will have you runnin' jewelry
Two or three of your crew will be bringin' all of your loot to me
Stupidly rappers assume I only mean musically
Until I beat 'em brutally, I'm fucked up truthfully, yeah
Holy Grail sipper, this is the Last Supper
I save a chosen few, and let the mass suffer
Cash lover, ass toucher, Ap's butter
Slash suckers 'fore I chamber a round and blast fuckers

[Scratch Outro: Sample]
Check it, loop a funky 45, and I'll wreck it
I'm not your average MC with the Joe Schmoe flow
Check it, loop a funky 45, and I'll wreck it
Skilled in the trade of that old boom bap
Check it, loop a funky 45, and I'll wreck it
If you don't know me by now, you'll never know
I can kick a rhyme over ill drum rolls
45 kiiiller!!!
