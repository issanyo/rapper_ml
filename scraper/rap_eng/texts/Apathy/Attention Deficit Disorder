[Verse 1: Apathy]
I don't waste energy on my enemies
Much worse when a motherfucker dead to me
Trynna bite it would take you a century
Cause essentially
I'm detonating a bomb on the original formula I created
Rappers that go after my rap are evaporated
Captain of the ship and he should be decapitated
Captured and trapped in a cabin and castrated
I never took a strangers' candy and I never made a hater family
And I never gave away the fancy top secret plan we get money without never ever needing a plan B
Ask Celph this is all organic
Keep calm, no need for panic
Just playing you should all be frantic
Trynna find a spaceship just to flee the planet
Pop shots at the ship as it takes of
Ricochets through the shields
Shoot your face off
Motherfucker never stop the beat or interrupt my rap or  try to turn my tape off
Y'all trynna sound smart when you sound more shallow than water inside of a tub
Ap's shit so deep that the pressure when you dive implodes every side of a sub

[Hook]
We starve
Look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from lavatories
Facing a dying nation
(Of m...)

[Verse 2: Apathy]
I don't ever pay attention, never stay on topic
I got ADD bitch, if it ain't about profit
I don't ever pay attention, never stay on topic
I got ADD bitch, if it ain't about profit
Not Mohammed the kind that go in your pocket
And no one can stop it I'm a Soviet rocket
A giant on the mic so it's microscopic
There's clues in the rap so the cops will cop it
Trynna solve the murder of the beat when I chop it
Put it in the woodschipper, flip it and rock it
Smack it up and hack it up and kill it with axes
The skill that I practice will fill up the caskets
With half ass rappers who blew their gaskets
Fuck what's hot I'm about the classics
I used to have an Audi but I crashed it
Now I got a Beemer and it's so fantastic
Used to be broke but with a hand me down jacket
Now I'm on the yacht with a new tennis racket
Maybe I went too far but I got a nice crib and I got a fly car
And I'm not a millionaire but I still live large
And I chill with stars cause I'm ill with bars
When my daughter grow up I'll retire on Mars
With the hearts of MCs that I've sealed in jars (trophies)
Displayed on the mantle
Some shit I write's too much for them to handle
So I put the pen down, blow out the candle, goodnight
Take 'em out with the sample

[Hook]
We starve
Look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from lavatories
Facing a dying nation
Of moving paper fantasies
(Lis...)

[Outro]
...the family began to hear very strange raps at night and they looked all over the house but couldn't find the source of these raps...
