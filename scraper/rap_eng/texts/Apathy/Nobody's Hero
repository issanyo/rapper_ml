[Verse 1: Apathy]

Don't even fool yourself, I'm in it for chicks
Turn an innocent bitch to the most sinningist trick
I'm in it for infinite shit, fame and girls
The pain, the gain and the chance to change the world
I'm bad, I'm good, I'm deep, I'm shallow
I'm a cool mother fucker at times
And other times, I'm an asshole
Influence young dudes with things they don't do yet
Pick blonde hairs off the bed cause your girls a brunette
Volatile, put a mother fucker in the hospital
Its possible to beat him 'til he's bleeding out his molecules
Politically radical rappers are different than
Fuck a lesson, I'll tell you what direction my dick will swing
Don't read too deep into the hook
This ain't school stupid mother fucker, pick up a book
This is rap you can fight to, crash your bikes to
Tracks you can write to, to last your life through

(Chorus)
How am I supposed to know which way to go
You tell me cause I don't know
Only do what I know
Im nobody's hero
So you tell me
No you tell me

[Verse 2: Apathy]

A formula for music
Out to change the world when we do shit
Mad scientists laboratory with the fluent flows
In one ear, fucks your brains up
Out the other ear, your outlooks changed up
Cause at the end of the day none of this really matters
Money, bitches, none of you other rappers
I'm not a good influence, I won't preach to kids
They wanna learn about life then just let 'em live
I tell 'em what I hear both sides of the spectrum
Positive and negative I'll see what effects 'em
Never see life through eyes like mine
Keep going 'til I'm there if my eyes don't shine
I gotta shift shapes whether spitting on mix tapes
For high school kids or their inmates who lift weights
The whole structure of earths about to shutter and burst
When I hit you mother fuckers with a verse

(Chorus)
How am I supposed to know which way to go
You tell me cause I don't know
Only do what I know
I'm nobody's hero
So you tell me
No you tell me

[Verse 3: Apathy]
I'm more than hell in a hand basket
I'm hell in a casket, hell of a classic
Spit raps that melt plastic
Collapse mic stands, decrease your lifespan
Your deceased while I sleep on a beach with white sand
I speak fact in each rap, mixed with myth
You gotta sort through the shit, for the truth I spit
Overlook the hook, the mix, the hookers, the tricks
This book is a scrypt, to live life look at this shit
It ain't about who's boutin', its about transforming
Like pauses until you wake up the next morning
This is your world, your life, your words, your sight
The eyes in the back of your head
What perfect fo(u)r sight
But go ahead, be the player that the chicks sweat
Smash that, hit her off, get your dick wet
You gotta live with yourself everyday
Your gonna do what you wanna do anyway
