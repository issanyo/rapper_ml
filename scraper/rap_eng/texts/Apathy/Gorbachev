[Intro:]
The old guard was losing its grip on power and a new regime was taking shape. What exactly that would look like, nobody could say. Suddenly the whole world could speak a few words of Russian, the most important: Perestroika (Perestroika, Perestroika, Perestroika, Perestroika)

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I leave ya head red like Gorbachev
Wake up in a bloody bathtub, no organs left
Morbid death, ain't one single mortal left
Now I'm more depressed, last man standin’ or the best... ever
Megatron arm, megaton bomb, energon
I’m the Devil’s spawn, leave em dead and gone
You’ll be dead by dawn, I’m dead wrong
Headstrong, bitch found in the ditch with her head gone
I’m long gone, cooler than Luke in the Tauntaun
I’m the Fonz doin’ sake bombs with soccer moms
Bawitdaba, the dang the dang bomb
Exploded cause the code to decode it was all wrong
Shoot you in the face and you won’t respawn
Send you to the great beyond with Egon
Little bitch tryna call out the name of a god
No way José, better get a day job
I’m Adam in the garden, I’m an atom bomb, pardon me
You Padawan, pat em on the head when I taught 'em
I’m a Jedi, juggernaut, jackin’ up Judas
Jig em in the jugular to drain out the juices

[Verse 2: O.C.]
Formation we’ve attained, military maneuvers
Concealed snipers, hard to spot shooters
Strapped with the 9mm or the Ruger
Dogs who warn, stand by ready to shoot up
Equipped with vehicles, ships, and aircrafts
Grenade launcher, disperse em with teargas
Layin’ down cover, firin’ off projectiles
Exert force that knock down an elephant
Big game hunter, lay em six feet under
Horns are like thunder in the skies with it
Perestroika armed forces storm ya fortress
Our missiles hit dead at your coordinates
This is the ordinance so obey my authority
Bein’ those a vet, it counts for seniority
Who’s down to die for the cause, if you’re soft
Don’t apply to y’all, most get nauseous seein’ body parts
Puttin’ jawns in flight to catch a bird’s eye view o’ things
If the enemy send rains then strike a death blow
When the body armor similar to tight clothes in particular
I smite those

[Outro: Scratches]
Cold like Russia
Cold like Russia
Perestroika
Perestroika
Perestroika
Perestroika
