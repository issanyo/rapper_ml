[Verse One]
I don't even know how I get through the week, don't sleep right
Each night stayin' up late
Gotta shut my cell phone off and I tell hoes off
When they try to come over to my place
A little bit of booty never hurt but I need to go to work
In the morning so I gotta say "no"
Even if it's quick, bullshit, we'll be gettin' into it
And I know you're not gonna wanna go
Every time I think things cool if I meet somebody new
And it's really all chill and such
They start to trip
Start to flip
And start to blow my phone up a little too much
You really need to relax, ease back
Understand I'm busy and it really ain't all about you
And did you ever stop to think that I might need space
And the world don't revolve around you?

[Hook] {x2}
Just give me a second
Let me be, let me be, let me be
Just give me a second
Let me breathe, let me breathe, let me breathe

[Verse Two]
Cause you're all up in my business, is this how you get attention
I'm really trying to figure it out
It ain't even close to workin', what you think you're flirting?
Honestly you're buggin' me out
I know you probably think your persistence is sparking my interest
Now I got hatred towards ya
Cause there's a difference with distance
You stalking bitch, better respect that restraining order
It ain't like it was one slip up
You filled up my voicemail, blowing it up
Like "Hey, what's wrong? Why don't we get up?"
I saved your number in my cell as Don't Pick Up
If you can't take a hint then let me be
Cause you're all up in my face, please let me breathe
Just, give me a second to think things through
And don't call me, I'll call you

[Hook]
