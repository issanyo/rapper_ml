[Intro]
Smoke weed everyday
I wanna get so high
Smoke weed everyday
Until the day that I die
Smoke weed everyday

[Verse 1: Apathy]
She told me I should write a song so she can smoke
And the fact I rap and that I don’t is an on-going joke
As she lit and took a toke she choked a little then she spoke
She said she buy so much weed it’ll probably make her broke
But life is heavy, bills are big, and bitches always stress her
So she keeps a bag of trees under her panties in her dresser
She looks so fucking sexy with a blunt between her lips
So I always cop her dutches from the store on my trips
And she can tell what kinda shit you smokin' by the smell
And music sounds better to her when she’s high as hell
She grew up playin' Cypress Hill and to the death
She said her last dying breath would be to puff with Meth
The cheeba cheeba queen, super reefer fiend
Marijuana mama, arteries that bleed green
I swear to God and pray she’ll never ever get away
'Cause she, 'cause she, 'cause she...

[Hook]
Smoke weed everyday
I wanna get so high
Smoke weed everyday
Until the day that I die
Smoke weed everyday
I wanna get so high
Smoke weed everyday
Until the day that I die
Smoke weed everyday
Until the day that I die

[Verse 2: Scoop Deville]
Yeah, I’m huffin', I’m chiefin', jumpin' off the deep end she fiendin'
'Cause I’m off the top when I speak it and she smoke a lot just like me
And we break it down then we roll, we smoke the pot like a stove
Like we cookin' but we bookin' from the cops on the low
Friends be laughin' and crackin' jokes in the room full of smoke
I keep an O everywhere I go, she know I'ma blow
A couple more of these and we gonna need some snacks from the store
Hey bro-bro, I got the dough-dough, we drinkin', don’t forget the 4-0's
And the Zig-Zags low-pro, fuck the po-po’s
I swing a four door, shit lookin' like a showboat
And we in high definition, watch your wishes go up in smoke
Like Cheech, I ain’t talkin' about Chong
Be real, I’m sneakin' hits from the bong
We know that it’s right when e'rybody say it’s wrong
I’m on cloud nine, fuck around and I'ma buy me a farm of that bomb
Wishin' Nate Dogg could sing this song, let’s go

[Hook]
Smoke weed everyday
I wanna get so high
Smoke weed everyday
Until the day that I die
Smoke weed everyday
I wanna get so high
Smoke weed everyday
Until the day that I die
Smoke weed everyday
Until the day that I die
