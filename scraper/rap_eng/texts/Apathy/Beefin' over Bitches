[Verse 1: Apathy & Kappa Gamma]
Eyo, bobby fought his best friend (Beefin' over bitches)
Spent a year inside the pen (Beefin' over bitches)
Split a motherfucker's wig (Beefin' over bitches)
They shot him at his moms crib (Beefin' over bitches)
Mike snuffed his own dad (Beefin' over bitches)
Thrown out his own path (Beefin' over bitches)
Started a little local war (Beefin' over bitches)
They stabbed him at the liquor store (Beefin' over bitches)

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Eyo, pussy is like poison, more like a potion
Fantasized of it since a young boy with lotion
Got my first taste I was wide the fuck open
No more stroking I was leaving pussies soakin'
When Biggie dropped Juicy I met this girl Julie
Little bubble booty had a older brother Rudy
Who hung out with some Puerto Ricans like that Juice movie
Real life, Radamez, straight up threatened to shoot me
He waited at the school as I walked through the snow
Acted like it's my fault that his sister is a ho'
Had a knife in his pocket but what this faggot didn't know
Is that Julie told me all about the shit the night befo'
Didn't really wanna fight but nothing I could do to stop it
Had a beanie on my head and beat batteries in my pocket
Took the head off and dropped the batteries aside
Trynna build up the courage even though I'm terrified
Rudy grabbed me by the shoulder, I figure he wanted beef
So I spun around, swung and knocked out his front teeth
Saw Rudy in the hall the next day, my heart skipped
But sucker walked right past me and ain't said shit

[Verse 3: Apathy & Kappa Gamma]
Rudy really tried to start beef (Beefin' over bitches)
Lost both his front teeth (Beefin' over bitches)
Stepped up and got smashed (Beefin' over bitches)
His own crew beat his ass (Beefin' over bitches)
Ayo, Rob fought this kid Jake (Beefin' over bitches)
Killed the kid by mistake (Beefin' over bitches)
Hit him with a metal bat (Beefin' over bitches)
And Jake's whole skull cracked (Beefin' over bitches)

[Verse 4: Apathy]
Will worked at Wall-Mart now he's just jobless
Wanna stick a weed dealer who lived in his complex
But it's such a complex task to accomplish
Need a gun, mask, and trustworthy accomplice
Holla'd at his homie Hector who he's known forever
Got a little hacienda with his honey named Michennia
Stopped at his crib and walked up on his porch
And Michennia standing there in these little tiny shorts
Now normally a lady would just go and cover up
But this chick is walking 'round like she didn't give a fuck
Will was probably thinking that she's trying to give it up
Cause she keeps bending over like she's picking something up
Hector walked out the house, slapped her in the mouth
Lookin' at them both crazy like (What's that all about?)
Will yelled like calm down cousin, you wrong
And start sticking his nose right where it doesn't belong
Saying that he shouldn't hit her, he shouldn't be with her
And that he acts bitter every time he drink liquor
Hector starts spazzin', Michennia starts laughing
And he sucker punched Will in his jaw just for yappin'
And then you won't believe what happened
Will pulled this little revolver out and started blasting
Accidentally killed Michennia, but not Hector
Now bullets in his leg sets off metal detectors

[Verse 5: Apathy & Kappa Gamma]
Will shot his mans chick (Beefin' over bitches)
Dropped the gun and ran quick (Beefin' over bitches)
He hid inside his aunts crib (Beefin' over bitches)
Now he's doing a long bid (Beefin' over bitches)
Eric got his brother shot (Beefin' over bitches)
Cause he try to cockblock (Beefin' over bitches)
That bullet was for Eric though (Beefin' over bitches)
He killed himself a year ago (Beefin' over bitches)
