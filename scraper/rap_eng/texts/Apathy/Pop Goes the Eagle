[Intro] [Woman speaking]
Let's all sing, Pop Goes The (Eagle)

Like to welcome y'all to class

[Verse One] [Motive]
Ayo, pop goes the eagle, hot slugs will greet you
With enough heat to cook beef stew, we eat duke
And me and Celph, we still hungry too
And we both keep guns like the Army do
So it's nothing to pay a visit to your block with lights off
Don't stop, just spray where you livin' like Lysol
We don't hesitate when we goin' to war
We'll redecorate your crib with bullet holes in the wall
Look you cats started to speak out a little bit too much
Until we put that gat to your teeth like a toothbrush
And if the jam won't spray I'll still be okay
Cause your man puts spice with a knife like O.J
95% of these rappers are so fake
Fuck tecs I'll handle these insects with roach spray
So what you wanna do?
Run and get your peoples?
I cock back the top
Pop goes the eagle

[Chorus] [x2]
Pop pop goes the eagle the eagle [x3]
Pop goes the eagle cause the eagle goes pop

[Verse Two] [Celph Titled]
Pop goes the eagle like Alka Seltzer and seagulls
Explosive when they bullets hit and delete skulls
The force of that hammer clap
Will leave your neck floppin' like a Santa hat
Barrel poppin' like a camera flash
By the time I get to Arizona
My +Broken Language+ is like them guys Smoothe and Trigger from Saratoga
Meditatin' in a lair of cobras
Disgusted by them two broads you with, for real they was a pair of ogres
Demigodzilla, I'm the god damn Tall Man from Phantasm
Canon nuns with cannon guns
Sanford Son collecting junk in my front yard
Blammin' thugs, infectin' punks who try to front hard
No way that I'm square when I pop rounds
I gave a Desert E to Heather B when she put her Glocks Down
Matter fact, Motive get the gats
Then let's unload these motherfuckin' biscuits in they pussy ass muffin batch

[Chorus] [x2]
Pop pop goes the eagle the eagle [x3]
Pop goes the eagle cause the eagle goes pop
