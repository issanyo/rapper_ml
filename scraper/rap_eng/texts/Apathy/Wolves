[Intro]
Yeah, Meta P
The homie Apathy
My man Swann Notty
Gem Crates on the beat
It's the wolves, We in here

[Verse 1]: Apathy
Death metal demolitionist this demigods ridiculous
Invulnerable to sin, similar in Leviticus
Levitating Indian style with knees bent
Rappers tryna speak my name in vain but repent
Stomp 'em in the cement, seas part where we start
Slash through the tracks, like an axe to tree bark
My rap will shatter your skull and scatter the brain matter
Splatter microscopical particles for forensic data
Under microscopes, pieces of the metal where mics are broke
And covered with radioactive isotopes
I'm Chernobyl with vocals I'm like a Russian village
That struck by a meteor, destroying his buildings
Cremate your whole crew, scattered their ashes
Battle the masses, feast on fatter the facists
Ap outlast roaches with a shelf life
That's longer than can food this dude straight melts mics

[Hook]: Meta P
MC's, beware, my philosophy's rear, huh
(Deadly when I pull the pin out, pin out)
If you battle my squad, that redefine all this
(Deadly when I pull the pin out, pin out)
When the wolves get in here, we smelling your fear, pussy
(Deadly me when I pull the pin out, pin out)
We heating up the stage and throwing grenades, pop
(Deadly when I, pull, pull the pin, pin out)

[Verse 2]: Meta P
Yeah, ammunition lace the track, this is Meta's kinda war
Coming in this sight of form, this is evidently roars
And we behind the bars, people hot in doors
Serving with they connoisseur, shut you off you final straw
You'd smaller here only hear the giant roar
I would saw my ankle off to leave the harvest seen, I am sore
My island it's Armani, we dying off
Pioneers touch by science, appliance stores
Rains hard, that's above the storm, fighting storm
At the speed of lights, start your soundbite likes kites and Jaw
Lion, dogs just as tiger crows, canine wipe the floor and bury you in iron ore
I'm the righteous, watch the bible burn
Feel the pain of losing sister, then life is learned
Predator for you is useless, a flightless bird
You was moving like a cheetah to the sniper heard

[Hook]

[Verse 3]: Swann Notty
Well let me verse and dive a track head first
Spit something so disgusting, disrupting your network
Lyrical expert, chatter your frame, make your chest burst
Next ride, it's your stretched hearse, then you're covered with fresh dirt
At tad through, ï»¿would a have you, watch over the wang old like ropes
Tying up all four of your limbs, then the torture begin
Then slowly dismantle your frame
Your daughter go in, decipher, yes you can't handle the pain
So let the masses know, I come with the classic flow
Clap a folds daily., no matter the pace, fast or slow
The weak have to go, never surpassing my status quo
Break the mic and use pieces of it to slash your throat
Mike skills they still a lacking and am sick a gapping
Cut open, drew blood, cuddles cover my denim jacket
It's all or never, If you thinking that you'll are better
Get on your knees with both palms together, pray for the best

[Hook]
