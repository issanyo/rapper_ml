[Hook: Apathy]
Old-school, got my Raiders cap
Got my, got my Raiders cap
Old-school, got my Raiders cap
Got my, got my Raiders cap

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I got that pistol grip pump sittin' pretty in the trunk
Blow your wig to the side like hair on Donald Trump
On some Gang Starr shit, execution of a chump
Evolution of a villain refillin' revolvers
I'm still in a state of mind like a stainless nine is on my lap
Starter jacket on my back, with a black Raiders cap
Rappers resurrect the crack like they brought Reagan back
You could run a 100 miles but you're still afraid of Ap
Hit record on your radios to take my verse
The only way to get to space and escape this Earth
Stick to the facts, Ap got the wickedest raps
OG like a Raiders cap with snaps in the back

[Hook: Apathy]
Old-school, got my Raiders cap
Got my, got my Raiders cap
Old-school, got my Raiders cap
Got my, got my Raiders cap

[Verse 2: Ryu]
I got my Raider cap old like a Betamax
Tats all grey and black bringin' '88 back
Sacks full of crack, brick phone in my backpack
Parker with the Marcus Allen jersey that'll match that
That's that shit I used to rock back
When I used to breakdance when I used to pop
I was always into somethin' bumpin' N.W.A. in the Cutlass
Me and the homies sippin' OE I was always a drunkard
You know how 'em L.A. dudes do, always got a deuce deuce
Don't say nothin' stupid or somebody gonna shoot you
Open up the moon roof, yellin' Demigoon crew
Somebody call 911 tell 'em you got a boo boo

[Hook: Apathy]
Old-school, got my Raiders cap
Got my, got my Raiders cap
Old-school, got my Raiders cap
Got my, got my Raiders cap

[Verse 3: Motive]
You know me, sippin' on a 40 of OE
On my stoop as a shorty shoutin' "Fuck Tha Police"
A nigga with a attitude but I ain't Yella
Hoodie, I touch more money than bank tellers
As a young cat standin' on black with my Raiders cap
While y'all was whilin' with medallions tryin' to fade to black
It's all good though, I ain't tryin' to hate on that
But Mo's hood so I stay where the danger's at
Niggas slangin' crack, gangstas wavin' gats
Pimp slappin' their bitch, askin' "where my paper at?"
I was amazed by that, influenced the way I act
Never met my dad, the truth is I'm raised off rap

[Hook: Apathy]
Old-school, got my Raiders cap
Got my, got my Raiders cap
Old-school, got my Raiders cap
Got my, got my Raiders cap

[Verse 4: Celph Titled]
I am MC Ren with pale skin rockin' my Raiders brim
Got a toaster that I ain't puttin' bagels in
I got a possee full of apostles
You a possee full of possums always hidin' while we hoo-ridin'
I judge who I shoot, so when my crew holds a grudge it's a judge that I shoot
We disassemble Nazi members, get totaled comin' at me top speed on a Kawasaki Ninja
Catch you out at LA at the Staples Center, Office Depot
You won't see though staples dead center in your retina
Yeah, I slammed it there and they ain't have cameras there
But if they did you'd see the second comin' of the man upstairs
Muh'fucka

[Hook: Apathy]
Old-school, got my Raiders cap
Got my, got my Raiders cap
Old-school, got my Raiders cap
Got my, got my Raiders cap
Nothin' you could say
