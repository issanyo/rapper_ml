[Verse 1: Apathy]
Stepping on the stage like anchors up wake 'em up
Raising up, Pirating flags I'm about to shake 'em up
Smoke on the water jumping overboard to avoid the slaughter
So I grab the senator's daughter shouldn'ta brought her
Them trade routes gotta get taxed it's simple facts
I relax while the money just stacks
Just sharpening my sword so if suckers come aboard
They'll be screaming out prayers like they summoning the Lord
Oh God, Oh Jesus get sliced to pieces
I'm in the Caribbean fucking whores on the beaches
Big titties bouncing, big booties, big rubies
Big diamonds in the chest I'm fresh I got groupies
From the Carolina coast to the whores in Tortuga
Who could stare into the fire and they'll tell you your future
I been drinking way too much rum
Getting dumb talking bitches into swallowing cum
Two pistols fully loaded tucked inside of my belt
Studied treasure maps all night before the candles melt
Strike fear in their hearts when they see that flag flying
Grown men crying, 'cause they know that everybody dying now

[Hook: Sampled]
Pieces of Eight (x4)
Buccaneers, who fought for years
For gold doubloons and
Pieces of eight

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Cannonball-sized hole in the ship deck
The skipper got a slit neck and left with the ship wreck
I'm trying to trap the little mermaid in my fishnet
And no pun intended but, I make the bitch get wet
You wiseass, shut your mouth and pass me the spyglass
Scanning the horizon with a flipped up eyepatch
Screaming from the crows nest to load up the cannons
But the ship was see-through and had a crew full of phantoms
So we hightailed it south to these Caribbean ports where we Anchored off the shore of some heavily armed forts
In the pitch-black of night nobody light up their torch
Undetected rowing oars silently to the shores
Tossed over a rope to cross over the moat
And snuck up behind a guard and slashed open his throat
Moving shadow to shadow with a sword, no gun
And watched 35 guards drop one by one
Before the sun was peaking over the edge of the Earth
I beheaded some jerk who leaked red on my shirt
Brought the bodies to the beach dead get left in the surf
Now I'm king and everything south of Heaven's my turf

[Hook]
