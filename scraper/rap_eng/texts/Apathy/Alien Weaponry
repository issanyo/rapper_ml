[Intro: Manly P. Hall]
"So now we come to another interesting episode. In the last few years, there has been a great deal of emphasis upon extraterrestrials visiting our planet."

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Ayo, these muh'fuckas buggin' if they think I'll hang it up
Pass the mic in my direction and I straight up ate it up
Really got the guns I talk about, I wouldn't make it up
Ultramag Four Horsemen, I'm about to Raise it up
'Til I’m Kool Keith crazy with voices that tell me shit
Trigger fingers extended like E.T. with Elliot
Ya get ya belly hit, it’s shakin' like ballistic gel, this is hell
Bodies gettin' dropped like pennies inside a wishin' well
Pennywise, fingers with Freddy knives and chainsaws
Put you in a coma make ya brain pause, this is why we break jaws
Singin' Judas Priest while we break laws
Rockin' break beats since Eazy E sold 8 balls
I travel through space now and lay foes face down
'Cause Ap is real, battlefields feel just like playgrounds
These little double time yappity yap rappers
I’ll rapidly smack backwards get battery packs fractured

[Pre-hook: Apathy]
We ain't in the same place
Or occupy the same space (Space!)
So get the fuck out my face

[Sample in Chorus]
Most of you can't even comprehend what I am saying
Even in my human form the message I'm relaying

[Chorus: Apathy]
I got that ancient technology
I keep the Alien Weaponry on me
I keep the Alien Weaponry
I got that ancient technology
I keep the Alien Weaponry on me
I keep the Alien...

[Verse 2: Apathy]
My verse makes earthquakes and aftershocks, scarin' off massive flocks
Of birds on rooftops, shatterin' glass in ya Apple Watch
Ap and Nottz rockin' like Axl Rose in acid wash
Astronauts blastin' off, laughin' while rappers watch
In disbelief, this is beef, problems you never wanted
My raps kill entire crowds and leaves ya whole town haunted
And while you rockin' man buns, I’m cockin' handguns
Stickin' you for paper I’ll pass down to my grand sons
Fans run when Ap is on the stage, I’m metamorphin’
In to a Demogorgon, I’ll give your head an abortion
I’ll leave ya brain in the dumpster, the braver the dumber
'Cause some brazen muthafucker 'bout to get his brains braided this summer
Since Biggie was Unbelievable, I was similar
Assemblin' sentences like defenses established around perimeters
You outgunned, outshined, must be out ya mind
Raps is putrid, Ap is stupid, slap the fluid out ya spine
Spit divine scripture, rhymes sicker than polio
I’m Godzilla in Tokyo, dick’s big as a totem pole
Got inhuman capabilities kinda like Opio
Grabbin' bulls by the horn this ain’t my first rodeo, yo

[Pre-hook: Apathy]
We ain't in the same place
Or occupy the same space (Space!)
So get the fuck out my face

[Sample in Chorus]
Most of you can't even comprehend what I am saying
Even in my human form the message I'm relaying

[Chorus: Apathy]
I got that ancient technology
I keep the Alien Weaponry on me
I keep the Alien Weaponry
I got that ancient technology
I keep the Alien Weaponry on me
I keep the Alien Weaponry

[Outro: Manly P. Hall]
"But what we seemed to have overlooked, is the possibility that these records that we now consider to arise from extraterrestrial sources could be the records of the great civilizations that were here before they destroyed themselves."

[Sample from the song You Belong to Me]
"See the Pyramids along the nile"
