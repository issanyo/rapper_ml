[Hook] {x2}
I worry about the world that we live in
I'm worried by all the confusion
I wonder about the lies I'm believing
I wonder where this sadness is leading

[Verse 2: Apathy]
You can't call it a comeback, I never stopped, could've went pop
I got signed, never got dropped, shit would've flopped
They want a frat boy and that boy is not so hot
If this is how it's gonna be I say, "fuck hip hop"
Artist feed record labels so they basically pimping
Like slaves build pyramids for ancient Egyptians
Work harder, work faster or you getting a whipping
They black list the Ap' but Ap keeps spitting
I'm an energizer battery, Apathy keeps ticking
And kicking and scratching and smashing this rapping I'm living
Like it's the end world in a matter of seconds
It's December 31st, 2011
Get the reverend, get the preacher, get a soldier, get a teacher
Turn my rap up in your speakers and then follow the leader
I'm cool as my flows in that Winter time song
Looking at this industry and wonder if I belong

"I just can't take it, I ask myself, "How will I make it?"
