[Verse 1: Apathy]
Y'all are a buncha posers, with over exposure
JJ Fad hair cuts and padded shoulders
Next year, dudes will probably be wearin' high heels
Make-up like a bitch, do whatever to sign deals
And I ain't just some old head stuck in my old ways
But I ain't feelin' rappers who look like they go both ways
Was raised in the greatest generation to do it
And you can hear it in my music now that rap is polluted
I'm like the Druid, a human, removin' all of the sewage
That y'all are spewin' and stewin' in dirty bodily fluids
I'm like the Brita to get rid of the shit they put in the water
They started to poison the people, the people they alter
Fluoridating, sedating the brain and breakin' they will
The same shit happened to rap, they extracted the skill
It's like pop is a poison, in the form of a pill
And you understand the risk, but you takin' it still
Every body recycles everybody else beats
50 versions of a song, 30 times in a week
That everybody repeats, that everybody is weak
East coast rappers be dick ridin' dirty south beats
There's no sense of culture, it's over, it's a wrap
Like what whites did to jazz when the music was black
Now these Internet fuck boys speak like it's fact
With that overly emotional rap, it's so wack

[Hook: Apathy]
Rap is not pop, If you call it that then stop
You ain't ever lived it, you new to hip-hop
Downloaded, googled it, when an album dropped
Never ever ever been inside a record shop
Rap is not pop, If you call it that then stop
You ain't ever lived it, you new to hip-hop
Downloaded, googled it, when an album dropped
Never ever ever been inside a record shop

[Verse 2: Apathy]
I put a bullet in my radio, put it out of it's misery
It'll be a cold day in hell before they get to me
Never surrender to their gender bender agenda
Remember Nebuchadnezzar and just return it to sender
I'm bout to burn it forever they Babylonian loadin' in
The subliminal Visuals since you watched nickelodeon
Or the pimp at the podium talkin' slick til you vote for them
I'd rather cut 'em open and soak the fucker in sodium
Stadiums packed with clones who scream and clap
For an auto-tuned hack singin' emo rap
Y'all need to stop what ya doin' like my Preemo track
You're so arrogant, it's embarrassin', your ego's wack
I'm too... Kool G Rap for these new school cats
I'm Freddie Foxxx with burn marks from Glocks on wax
I hi-jack racks relax steady stick to the facts
'Cause stick up kids is out to tax
Volume at the max with the sunroof back
I was rappin' when the rappers didn't care about a plaque
Or the plastic facade, it's fact it's a fraud
Aps classic a rap intergalactic god
Escaped from a pod like Kal-El from out Hell
With flows that would make any earthlings mouth melt
Yo... Watchin' MTV With Public Enemy
Peace to Ted Demme, I was raised on that energy

[Hook: Apathy]
Rap is not pop, If you call it that then stop
You ain't ever lived it, you new to hip-hop
Downloaded, googled it, when an album dropped
Never ever ever been inside a record shop
Rap is not pop, If you call it that then stop
You ain't ever lived it, you new to hip-hop
Downloaded, googled it, when an album dropped
Never ever ever been inside a record shop

Play me in the Autumn, any order"
