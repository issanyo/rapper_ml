[Hook][2x]
Now memories are all we can cling to
Now memories are all we can cling to

[Verse 1: Blacastan]
I see paint brush strokes of the past no joke
If you ain't hood enough, you can get your pass revoked
Dope fiend yoke these young boys fiend for this coke
I'm off of my dean
Everyday I'm losing more hope
Niggas scramble on a avenue with bundles of dope
Cause we gamble for the revenue with guns in our coats
We know Obama is the president, but none of us vote
Jakes be running in our residence to bomb us with smoke

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Get your esophagus choked
Tossed in a bottomless moat
Invade your pyramid temples and leave your obelisks broke
Napoleon shooting the Sphinx' nose
Solomon pimps hoes
Y'all be touching little boys and lamping in pink clothes
Sticking whores backstage searching for my signature
Roaming through a maze 'till they come across the Minotaur
I don't need a metaphor To tell you what I get 'em for
Ap hold it down like Magneto on a metal floor

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Zilla]
I'm a persuasive ass metal toting Mexican cat
Americano with a bottle of that poisonous rap
Call me Zilla, ain't no filler when I'm feeling my stacks
Leaving you struck on every side like very bar was a match, yeah
It's never kosher when supporters ain't copping ya shit
Signing your poster like "I thank you for rocking my shit"
Hit you with dosages of that murderous bodying clique
Until the memories are stuck in your bottomless pit

[Verse 4: Vinnie Paz]
Married a Glock to the clip
I am impossibly sick
I am the atrocity that carried the mosh to the pit (New York hardcore)
I just think of y'all as innocuous shit
Moet Chaundon, y'all are just bottles of piss
Vinnie fire starter when phosphorous lit
Every beat is wild heavy with monstrous kick
Computer talk rapper y'all an anonymous bitch
Y'all ain't hard when it's time to just ball up the fist

[Hook]
This one time I begged you, forgive me
Just this one time I beg you, forgive me
Come back

[Verse 5: King Syze]
I've been repping since a kid now I'm a grown man doing it
I pool your blood, drain your body till it's fluidless
Come with your religion, put that logic on the crucifix
I evolved from energy, energizing your foolishness
I'm listed in the Holy Grail on my way to Heaven
Compare your resume's your Testament's not testing 'em
I'm like Floyd Mayweather at taking time off
I come back with no ring rust and break y'all off

[Verse 6: Planetary]
I'm a serious sickness, no cure for my ridiculousness
Now bare witness man my syllabus as ill as it gets
Pharaoh, bow and arrow, double barrow, narrow grave digger
Battle cry, battle hymns, shatter all you made niggas
That's how I live, my vernacular is spectacular bitch
Twin Accuras, we riding out and blasting your kids
Ap and Blac, back to back, put a crack in your ribs
And that's that, we back, Syze, that's what it is
