[Excerpt: Banquet Night by Rudyard Kipling]
"Carry this message to Hiram Abiff."

[Verse 1: Apathy]
All wise is the owl who can see in the dark
All rise for the lessons of the evenin' to start
All seein' is the being who created the spark
Man knows he knows nothin' if the man is smart
Star charts, technology is silly to those
Who know real space travel only happens with souls
Molecules and energy disassemble and flows
Where space bends and distorts, we are UFOs
King Hiram, master of all builders
Stepped in two pillars, stalked by three killers
Buried inside a village but waitâ€¦ I'm not finished
Risen from the grave as a holographic image
Let's have a conversation, about the constellations
About sound and light and matter and vibrations
The mathematics needed just for your genetic sequence
While humans are distracted studyin' devils and demons
I need more than thirty-three I'm three-sixty
I need more than religious scriptures can give me
I'm in a chamber a reflection gettin' busy
Chantin' and meditatin' 'til I'm dizzy
Memento mori, end of story, I told you I'm Grand Leveler
You'll never catch a grip or a token if you're a regular
You suckers had it twisted since the Morgan Affair
I'm horseback attackin' haters with a sword in the air
Sort of rare but you could sort of compare me to brother Manly
I got poets and scholars and Pharaohs in my family
People tryna decipher and try decodin' me
Fans constantly quotin' me, brothers sayin', "So mote it be"

[Chorus]
I'm from your ancient future
Legend of the third degree god, Hiram Abiff
Burn emcees like degrees of Mason, 'cause you're fakin'
Legend of the third degree god, Hiram Abiff
I'm from your ancient future
Legend of the third degree god, Hiram Abiff
A Master Mason when I'm buildin' my pyramid
Legend of the third degree god, Hiram Abiff

[Bridge]
My brother to the east, my brother to the east
My brother to the east, my brother to the east
My brother to the east, my brother to the east
My brother to the east, my brother to the eaaast

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Deep inside the forest, underneath the trees
Lit up by the torches, goin' through degrees
Started horizontal, lifted vertically
What's the magic number? Three
Mystery schools in ancient Egypt, alien science equipped
Hovered above in three ships large enough to eclipse
The sun/son, the widow, the virgin mother Mary
A sprig of acacia found inside a cemetery
Let's talk of hieroglyphics not the pseudoscientific
The phony spirit healers or a reading by ya mystic
The snake oil sellers or some fabricated cleric
Who speak of all religion to exploit the esoteric
The crystal rubber, card reader, Ouija board controller
The spell caster, cult leader or some holy roller
The soul sucker, vampire feedin' off ya energy
And people still believe in some imaginary enemy
I never look to the skies to say a prayer
There's no mystical wizard who's up there
Everything that ever was is everywhere
So let's light the three candles for this black tie affair
I'm stargatin' while y'all are stargazin'
Heart starts racin' like studyin' Carl Sagan
Standin' in formation, chantin' the oration
Tell the mortals there will be no teleportation
Deep and dark woods down the creepiest roads
Different symbols letters and numbers you can see 'em decode
In the creepiest robes, bunch of people we loathe
I don't fuck with the shit they do in that Bohemian Grove

[Chorus]
I'm from your ancient future
Legend of the third degree god, Hiram Abiff
Burn emcees like degrees of Mason, 'cause you're fakin'
Legend of the third degree god, Hiram Abiff
I'm from your ancient future
Legend of the third degree god, Hiram Abiff
A Master Mason when I'm buildin' my pyramid
Legend of the third degree god, Hiram Abiff
