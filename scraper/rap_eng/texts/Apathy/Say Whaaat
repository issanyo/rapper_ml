[Verse 1: Ryu]
I feel good
Even though I shouldn’t
I’m chilling so hard couldn’t tell you where the hood is
I’m looking like a million bucks
Sucka I’m sorry
Jeep so clean might as well be a Ferrari
Took off the top like an African safari
Heading to the beach cause I heard the waves are gnarly
No flip flops just a pair of old Barkleys
Got the golden ticket like I took that shit from Charlie
Hardly the day to complain
Ima save that for later
Right now I’m too busy being lazy as a gator
Even if I seen a hater
Wouldn’t tell him eat a dick
Cause my shit is hotter than a chicken incubator is
Got a smile on my face
And a roll full of dough
Feeling great cuz I just ate a hot bowl of Pho
Make a stop at the store
Grab a 40 for the road
Who am I kidding make it two and a pack of smokes

Chorus
I feel good
And it sounds kinda gangsta
I’m sorry but I guess it’s in my nature
Vibrating got the bass all cranked up
Chilling in that ‘85 Samurai, say what

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Man I love these palm trees
They’re so different from the east
Subwoofers bumping beats
Keep a lookout for police
Cause I’m still drinking 40s like it’s 1993
Listening to a cassette of DOC and Diamond D
Got a shirt with a koala and I’m rocking Wallabees
Follow me
But it’s kinda hard when I’m wobbly
Cuz the turntables wobble gotta rock em properly
Got em from my man who got em in a little robbery
And I’ll sell em for a G
They’re ain’t shit your telling me
Cuz I know it before you say it like I got telepathy
Want to diss before you know me well I know it’s jealousy
Caught you walking down the street whistling this melody
And I’m booming
Im booming
Ap is so fly it’s hard to believe that I’m human
More like a mutant
Start a revolution
Better start cruising
Before they start shooting

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Scoop Deville]
Booming down the block in the drop top
Haters catch a soft spot
Cuz I does it nonstop
You ain’t got it on lock
Run in to that pawn shop
Try to sell that cheap chain trade it for a small watch
Got the Uzi palmed cocked
Got the posse on deck
You ain’t puffing like me
We could have a contest
Not to disrespect but I really like your mom's breast
Oops I mean your mom's fresh, I’m just being honest
It’s funny all the shit that floats around in my self-concious
I’m pumping up my ego
People say I’m pompous
Acting like a Chief like I fucked Pocahontas
Maybe it’s just you ain’t used to being around bosses

[Refrain]
