[Verse One] Ryu & Apathy:
Stay on my mind all the time
On my dick cuz I rhymed
Way before I got signed
In the FILA’s with the straps
How you doing?
Girl relax
Im a head banger, check check my check my air max

[Ryu]
Hey yo Ap I need a rhyme

[Apathy]
Come and check the backpack

[Ryu]
No gold digger I politely ask for cash back
Catch a cab to the pad
You so mothafuckin rad
I already met ya mama while you hide me from ya dad

[Apathy]
I ain’t in love with her but fuck for her
Been nervous for a whole month
Every time I cum in her
A summer love or something snap my fingers just to summon her
She slapped told me don’t be acting like Apathys running her
I’m done with her
I’m done with thinking dumpin her will punish her
The pussy pushed me to the point I almost wanna pummel her
That little hussy hustled me and ran off with some hustler
That’s why I seem disgusted every time i start discussing her

[Hook]
Come and talk to me
Cuz if you know we don’t care there
There’s a couple over there that I’m gonna say
Can I talk to you?
If I decide to
I really wanna
Just get inside you
Come and talk to me
Cuz if you know we don’t care there
There’s a couple over there that I’m gonna say
Can I talk to you?
If I decide to
I really wanna
Just get inside you

[Verse Two]: Apathy & Ryu:

[Ryu]
I really wanna get to know you better
Grow old together be ya big papa
You could be my mama like Voletta Wallace
Look inside my wallet you could tell I ain’t got a baller bitch
But I’d you find a dollar you can spend it all
All of it
I ain’t making promises or prophisizing profit
If it’s possible to talk to you I’ll put some in your pocket boo
I could be your dog but
Ryu ain’t no Cockapoo
So if you want to walk
Ima treat you like a prostitute

[Apathy]
Treat her like a prostitute
I’m H town when i’m knocking boots
Not so rich but I’m locking those chicks
Don’t wear skinny jeans cuz my cock won’t fit

[Ryu]
I got ya pops so pissed
He can’t even get a wink of sleep
Knowing that his baby girls out getting drinks with me
Chugging Brass Monkey it always bring out the beast in me
