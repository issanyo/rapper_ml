Apathy motherfucker, 8th wonder, evil


[Apathy]
My power compels hell's demons to slam dance
And when I stage dive I burn all of my fans hands
My microphone is buried in the catacombs
Underneath Indiana Jones decomposed bones
Never fuck around I'm the thermo aerodynamic shuttle graph that crashed on a small foreign planet
4 billion years ago now humans hear my flow and hold their heads like their ears will blow
Arrows pierce my foe I'm fierce to those who oppose
We bring sharp darts spears and bows
Always on the low move slow like crouching ninjas
Plus the squad got more gods than mount olympus
Battle like were vicious sacrifice infants
And hack into the government with satellite positions
Evacuate your land like its Afghanistan
Cause our missile move faster than your fucking camels can

[Chorus]
Move, Bounce, come on fight
Wild the fuck out while we rock the mic
Bob your head to this track you don't stop for shit
Evil, 8 and apathy with the power to rip (motherfucker)

[Evil]
My power
Devours flesh like acid showers
And makes whole troops roll out like after hours
Fuck y'all back off to hell with your squad
Im a god, watch the sun melt in my palm
My intelligence sours beyond yours its your highness
The white stallion rock the moon its my medallion
And the saturn rings is the link to the chain
Im on a higher level we just ain't thinking the same
I throw my dick into space and play pool with the planets
Knock shit out of orbit watch fools start to panic
Precise with the flow never rapping off beat
Even got more power than those cats on dragon ball z
What y'all know about me
Blasting galactic weapons
That would make the human race break out fast like adolescence
Ah black magic repping warlocks and witches
But still remain low-key like door locks for midgets

[Chorus]
Move, Bounce, come on fight
Wild the fuck out while we rock the mic
Bob your head to this track you don't stop for shit
Evil, 8 and apathy with the power to rip (motherfucker)

[8th wonder]
My power
Attracts power magnetically
Evil apathetic and me surpass any degree
We snatch cheddar and flee
I laugh any mc claiming then raps stack pack metal better than we
Fuck that kids stuff i ain't taking that shit
Get your ass out of bed and stop making you sick
I skydive out plane on tour stage backwards
The vision to ill to stunt double reenact
So understand yo the level I'm at
I could spit phlegm and that would be a terrible act
And when i get on the track and fuck around is when i tell you
Cause if you get me mad I'LL TRANSFORM INTO THE DEVIL
Ill stop the beat freak it a cappella and scream
I'm too fucking dirty from black decka [?] to clean
Command it to go backwards
I'm damaging all rappers
I'm a martian that landed on the planet to cause havoc

[Chorus]
Move, Bounce, come on fight
Wild the fuck out while we rock the mic
Bob your head to this track you don't stop for shit
Evil, 8 and apathy with the power to rip (motherfucker)
