[Intro]:
Wake up stupid. Wake up! No! No! I want an Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle!
You'll shoot your eye out, kid. Merry Christmas. Ho ho ho

Merry Christmas bitches. Apathy. Scoop DeVille

[Verse One]:
All I want for Christmas is Tribe to reunite
A brand new pair of Nikes and Drake to take a hike
And my dream is for Nas to do an album with Preem
And Wu-Tang to make a song that's as classic as C.R.E.A.M
I'm screaming "ho ho ho" and it's kind of fucked up
That bitches on my Twitter timeline respond "What's up?"
So I'm making this list and I'm checking it twice
I'm about to start snatching mics if motherfuckers ain't nice
These fag rappers clothes tight like it's Miami Vice
I want to stocking with a knife and a bat full of spikes
If Chris Kringle out there, please give me an answer
I left a whole plate of weed brownies out for Santa
So if you see a sleigh flying over at Atlanta
On it's way down to Tampa puffing with Donner and Dancer
Please tell him I don't care if it's for Christmas or Hanukkah
But I need that debut album from Jay Electronica
And some Polo wouldn't hurt, maybe a hoodie or two
Ayo Blac, should I tell him to bring some pussy for you?
(A yes sir!)
Case closed, let's continue our business
Scoop Deville gave me like a 100 beats for Christmas
And I'm...

[Hook]:
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
The mood is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's what's up
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Verse Two]:
All I want for Christmas is for Big L to be alive
I guess we took that shit for granted back in 1995
All I want is for KRS to be these kids teacher
Or Rakim to make these young dudes "Follow The Leader"
Twas the night before Christmas and all through my spot
You can hear me playing 'Liquid Swords' like it just dropped
Cause it's a 'Cold World' boys and girls, take it from me
I got a box of ammunition waiting under my tree
And either I'm going crazy or ain't taking my medicine
But I saw Santa get locked for breaking and entering
And it ain't the first time I've seen him up to no good
Some Crips made him change clothes before he came in his hood
Oh well, what the hell, ring your little Jingle Bells
Me and Celph got elves putting records on shelves
I was sipping Vodka with Vixen and Comet and Cupid
So don't ask me if I'm okay, I'm vomiting stupid
Tangled up in all the lights and the fake reindeer
My neighbors haven't taken down for the past eight years
So here's to the New Years, fuck them haters and bitches
Cause I'm simply having a wonderful Christmas

[Hook]:
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
The word is out, about the town
So lift your glass
Ah, don't look down
The mood is right
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong
The mood is right
The party's on
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's what's up
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
The mood is right
The party's on
The spirits up
We're here tonight
Ohhh, that's enough
Ohhhhhhh
Christmas time
