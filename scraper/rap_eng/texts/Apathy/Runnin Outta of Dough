Sushi from the finest chefs
Super jam
Find a beach
Yucatan follow me
Drop the top let’s take a peak
Scoop Deville drop the beat
Boom boom boom
I make your trunk all rattly
Boom boom boom
Your neighbors be all mad at me
I’m rolling with the roof off
Listening to Snoop Dogg
Throwing Benjis like confetti
Actin’ like a douche ball
Boom boom boom
Boom

Chorus:
I’m running out of dough
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It’s getting kinda low
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I’m running out of dough
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It’s getting kinda low
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Daddy
Oh daddy give me dough
I’m running out of blow
And I think I’m gonna die
Die
Die
Daddy you showed me where your boat is
You told me you were loaded
But I guess it was a lie
Lie
Lie

[Verse 3: Scoop Deville]
Everybody know this
Get focused
And realize us guys are the dopest
So clean I don’t know where the soap is
So high I don’t know when I wrote this
Some say I’m hopeless
Or that I’m bogus
Come through bulletproof like the pope is
In the coupe
No roof
Fuck me
Fuck you
Scoo-woop
Bang bang LA city
It’s that Get Busy Committee
Like her ass and tig old bitties
Double D’s you mickey frickies
Bang bang LA city
It’s that Get Busy Committee
Like her ass and tig old bitties
Double D’s you mickey frickies

I’m running out of dough
I’m running out of dough
I’m running out of dough
I’m running out of dough

Chorus:
I’m running out of dough
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It’s getting kinda low
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I’m running out of dough
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It’s getting kinda low
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

I’m running out of dough
Oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh
I’m running out of dough
Oh oh oh oh
