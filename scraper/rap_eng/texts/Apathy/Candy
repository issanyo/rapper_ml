Candy
I call my sugar candy
(Because I'm sweet on)

[Dose]
Top of the list together like Twix
My doctor says to give you up I'm taking a risk
My friends say I'm all hype but that's all they can say
They see I'm about 3 Swedish Fish from a Hershey's Kiss
See she's thicker than a Snickers in smore
And it really doesn't matter Now or Later if I score
I met her on Fifth Avenue not in no hood bar
I bet a hundred grand I'll be your Mr. Goodbar
Butterfingers gripped to ridiculous hips
While she giving me Good'N'Plenty with her licorious lips
I can't call it I can't front I'm stuck I'm a sugarholic
Always got my Pushpop in her Whatchamacallit
I'm in love symphony and doves what do I do
How I turned my little Chicklet into a Big League Chew
We need a house a six and some beautiful kids
And we'll be in candyland with our Junior Mints
Because she's

I heard you was chilling with them Nerds and the Sourpatch Kids
Sniffing nose candy no Candy I ain't in your biz' but
Every single payday you're checking your Sidekick
Hit the Kit Kat club and sniff a Pixie Stick
You got a Sugardaddy but when will money learn
That that shit will turn his candybar into a Gummy Worm
Got fired from your job so you hit me up
Told me that they made you piss in a Reeses Cup
She a freak all you gotta do is rub up against her
And she'll push her head back like a Pez dispenser
Told me one day she going to be a monster star
But she never found that golden ticket in a Wonka Bar
You understand me Candy I talked to your family
They said they ain't heard from you since was in Miami
Got a pimp, tried to make a little mint like Andes
Traded in your Fruit Roll Ups for eadible panties
Damn Candy
