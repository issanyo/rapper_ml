[Intro: Royce da 5’9”]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Y'all know my name
In case you forgot it's Nickel, nigga
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Apathy]
A badder cracker, no rapper
Could battle Ap or go after
'Cause rap for rap, it don't matter
I baffle you bastards, I'm bad for your brains
The brainiac who's brutal as dictators
'Cause I've been shitting out singles since y'all was just sixth graders
I'm sick, simple as that, I disassemble the track
Like Navy SEALS field strip gats in pitch black
I'm abstract, but not like that backpack rap
Like the tats on my arm come to life and attack
So if you forgot my name you gotta be insane
Get a CAT scan, I'm deep in every rap fan's brain
What's the scenario? I'm murdering beats and I bury flows
Putting stereos on death row like Harry O
Shit you say is not necessarily true
I'm so fly I peep game from an aerial view
On a scale on one to ten you barely a two
Y'all are pussies, I'mma call you the ovarian crew
Motherfucker

[Hook]
"If you forgot my name or my style"
"As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau, and also what defines my name"
"If you forgot my name or my style"
"As far as my name"
"It's only natural I explain my name"

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
Yeah
By the way I'm a problem, amazing
Many, many died tryna solve the equation
There's only one of me until history repeats me
I came, saw, conquered; I'm veni, vidi, vici
No wrongs or no rights do apply to my life
Now I'm grown, not zoned, I'm alone with my mic
I ain't tryna hear what y'all did, this is my kingdom
The king lifts his finger and swing up the drawbridge
From the Philippines to New Orleans
The heels of the grassiest knoll and assassinate rappers
From the past to the present to the flashiest flowin'
Yeah, they the best 'til they pass through my colon
Underhand pitch 'em from the Av like I'm bowling
Here to get the cash while I'm Aston my rolling
Nickel Nine AP, niggas tryna play me
Nigga, I would end it, I'm a different kind of crazy

[Hook]
"If you forgot my name or my style"
"As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau, and also what defines my name"
"If you forgot my name or my style"
"As far as my name"
"It's only natural I explain my name"
