[Intro: Sample]
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary

[Hook 1: Sample]
And my mentality is money orientated
I’m money orientated, I’m money orientated
And my mentality is money orientated
I’m money orientated, all my peeps who never made it

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Is it cash which you’re after, after all?
Playing roles like an actor at casting calls
From an infant, the instant you laugh and crawl
To the death, last breath and the casket falls
Get money, get paper, get dough, get currency
Property, jewelry, stability, security
Cause I know you and you know me
I’ll front you then you’ll owe me
And they probably want a taste of what that life is like
And they’d probably stab their mother if the price is right
Cause sitting right in front of broke folks counting money
Is like eating food in front of somebody hungry

[Refrain: Apathy]
Cause this right here got the girls in a frenzy
This right here make the whole world envy
This right here got my brain fucked up
Cause this right here, this this right here

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Even if I made more money than the porno biz
Had a genius accountant, some sort of wiz
I would still be broker than the orphan kid
Cause I wear more Jordans than Jordan did
And I’m calling overseas when I’m back in Connecticut
My cellphone bill looks like the national deficit
Cause I know you and you know me
I ain’t rocked stunner shades since Kool Mo Dee
And The Treacherous Three, what I’m destined to be
Leaving my bank account effed up effortlessly
Dark clouds or sunny, beautiful or ugly
Everybody stay chasing after that money

[Refrain]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Emilio Lopez ]
You ain’t nothing but a slave for the money
You think you a pimp, but that Franklin in your pocket is what paid for your honey
Can’t sit and wait for your days to get sunny
Crime pays tax-free, ain’t nothing funny
The boy became a hustler, the girl turned stripper
She wanna cop Gucci, he wanna get a blicker
Every time I sit down and mash on the clicker
I see some new shit that turn me to a gold digger
Don’t know what made me materialistic
All I know is that I gotta be on some rich shit
Shopping at the mall everyday like it’s Christmas
I got a slight problem, only money can fix this

[Refrain]

[Hook]
