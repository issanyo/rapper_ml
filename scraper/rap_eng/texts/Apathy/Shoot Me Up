Chorus:
Downtown living life down low
Ain’t no telling where tonight might go
Will I ever wave goodbye don’t know
If I do I want you to

Shoot me up
Shoot me up shoot me up
Shoot me up
Shoot me up shoot me up
Shoot me up
Shoot me up shoot me up
Shoot me up
Shoot me up shoot me up

[Verse 1: RYU]
Call your pops tell him wire us some money baby
I get a job and I’ll pay him back tomorrow maybe
Not, yea shoot me up take a shot
Share a needle and fuck, this is how we rock yea
I could never stop I could never get enough
Pop another pill, sniff, take another puff
Are we happily in love or is it just lust
The only time we get along is when were getting fucked up
For real, they say we bad for each other
Forget rehab I ain’t trying to fucking recover
Tell your mother I can quit whenever I choose to
I don’t need that dumb bitch and that Dr. Drew dude
You can do you, I’m'a do guess who? Yes me
I can shoot a balloon and make it look it sexy
It’s a, hard rock life I live it out of focus
Looking for a vein to spike before I’m dope sick

Chorus:
Downtown living life down low
Ain’t no telling where tonight might go
Will I ever wave goodbye don’t know
If I do I want you to

Shoot me up
Shoot me up shoot me up
Shoot me up
Shoot me up shoot me up
Shoot me up
Shoot me up shoot me up
Shoot me up
Shoot me up shoot me up

Verse 2: Apathy]
The pharoah king, hot like heroin
Blowing money arrogant, I’m so american
We could acquire a range of things
Turn veins and syringes to angel wings
So kids just say “no” or just stick with blow
It took my brother away, the H ate his soul
Kick start his heart, too late he’s gone
Show him love in a song like I must go on
Fuck around I’ll be chilling down in heroin town
Willimantic CT is where I’m usually found
Get busy like Debbie Harry, bury your nose in it
Don’t bother fixing your hair, don’t worry it goes with it
It seemed like a long shot, but soon as this song drop
You see fiends bringing iPods to pawn shops
Shoot me up I’m biggie, shoot me up I’m 50
A needle in the vein to the heart of the city
I’m

Chorus:
Downtown living life down low
Ain’t no telling where tonight might go
Will I ever wave goodbye don’t know
If I do I want you to

Shoot me up
Shoot me up shoot me up
Shoot me up
Shoot me up shoot me up
Shoot me up
Shoot me up shoot me up
Shoot me up
Shoot me up shoot me up
