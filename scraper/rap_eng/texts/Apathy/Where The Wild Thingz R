[Intro: Bishop Lamont]
This is, this is where the wild things are
Comin' to ya live!
Where the wild things are
I think... I don't know, where are we comin' from? Where is this place?
(You're where the wild things are)
This is, this is where the wild things are
Where the wild things are
This is, this is where the wild things are
Where the wild things are, where the wild things are

[Verse 1: Bishop Lamont]
Lets get liquor from the fuckin' liquor store
And get way fucked up like we did before
Which way is up, I can't tell no more
It's been spinnin' and spinnin', my brain swimmin' and swimmin'
Hardcore I'm dirty as the floors in the project buildings
Raw three days straight, same dingy-ass draws
Rhyme style funky, yeah j-just like my balls
Gun clappers, my niggas will give you applause
A standin' ovation, you in violation
You bitch niggas lookin' like Rhythm Nation
Lookin' all glittery, saw a clitoris, pussy nigga literally
You need a pap smear, my near spread severe
Venereal diseases through the stereo Jesus
Hip hop need me to bring in the cure, pick up the pieces
Let's move it move it move it, now as I proceed
My niggas and niggettes blaze up your weed
Rock on, real hip hop is back up in this bitch

[Hook:]
Now put your lighters in the air, your lights in the air
Now wave 'em round and round, side to side hell yeah
Now wave 'em round and round, side to side hell yeah
I put my sports jersey's and my Timbs back on

[Bridge: Apathy]
Ayo, hold up a second Bishop, man you know you dead wrong
It ain't a real party if it ain't with Honkey Kong
Let me fuck this mic up, it won't take that long

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Ayo, I'm every MC, it's all of me
But I'm less Heavy D much more Steady B
So in static when the TEC stutter, hold it steadily
Keep it sturdy, flip the birdie, rip the ruger readily
In his belt strap, raps that disintegrate and melt wax
Lumps on your skull, better start rockin' elf hats
Ap never held back, never bit my tongue
Rather sever it and load it like a clip into a gun
I emergin', with swords I'm a surgeon
Keep the power surgin', like I decapitated the Kurgan
Label us "dirty version", fuckin' a dirty virgin
Fuck it, Ap is a vermin, chuggin' yak with the bourbon
The back of a suburban, head wrapped in a black turban
Observin' a bitch bobbin' her head in my lap burpin'
Bubbles I'm steady burstin', swoopin' and Silver Surfin'
Fightin', cussin', and cursin', rappers will know it's curtains
Gotta stay current kinda like electric circuits
If verses ain't perfect, they're ineffective and worthless
Pray to who you worship, forfeit 'fore I pull the four fifth
Carry more coffins than a forklift
On a military base deep in Saigon
During Vietnam, with a ho singin' me a song
Like, "Ah, me so horny, me love you long time."
Wearin' black, carry gats like kids in Columbine

[Hook x2:]
Now put your lighters in the air, your lights in the air
Now wave 'em round and round, side to side hell yeah
Now wave 'em round and round, side to side hell yeah
I put my sports jersey's and my Timbs back on
Change clothes nigga, it's the reverse of this song
Now put your lighters in the air
