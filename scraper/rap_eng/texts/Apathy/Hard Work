[Hook]:
I work hard for this money
Work hard for this money
Work hard for this money
Work hard for this money

Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
You just want me for my dough
If she hollers let her know
Out goes Y-O-U

[Verse One]:
And now we're off and poppin'
I tell you why they jockin'
They think I take them shoppin'
That simply not an option
They feeling on my pockets
Estimating my profits
Your brain is microscopic
Out goes Y-O-U
Trying to get a little dough (dough)
Don't let it know (know)
That you worked so hard
It's hard to let it go (go)
You need outfits with the kicks to go
Want to eat, get it to go, forget it and go
I'm trying to keep this money
Y'all wanna keep it from me
That isn't even funny
You could get beat and bloody
I'm trying to make this money
You wanna take it from me
Go 'head and shake it honey
But I won't play the dummy

[Hook]:
I work hard for this money
Work hard for this money
Work hard for this money
Work hard for this money

[Verse Two]:
Eeny, meeny, miny, fuck that
That's my money, bitch don't touch that
Gold diggers know your limits, no forgiveness, take the bus back
I know one thing for certain
The reason why they flirting
The bread these dudes will throw at birds to keep them chirping, chirping
Slick as serpents, lips are working, chicks rehearse this, think you worthless
If at first the drinks ain't purchased
Out goes Y-O-U
Rewind and slow it down
The way she throws it down
You'll think she's going down
Her game is so profound
Complex and intricate
She's insignificant
I just be ignorant
And say she isn't shit
So you're a working girl
You're trying to work the world
Well, how's it working girl?
Come here and work it girl

[Hook]:
I work hard for this money
Work hard for this money
Work hard for this money
Work hard for this money
