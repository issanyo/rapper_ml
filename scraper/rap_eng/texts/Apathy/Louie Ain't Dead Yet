[Hook] {​x2}​
Morning sky, cloudy and grey
Here am I, nothing to say

[Verse 1]
I try not to get in other people's biz
Louie ain't dead yet but y'all talking like he is
Me and homie been tight since we were kids
Chilling at each other's cribs, raiding each other's fridge
Life goes different ways they say
It started with a pack of cigs and a six pack a day
But addictive personalities are apt to stray
Sniffed yay and all his close friends backed away
Everybody lines up to kick a man when he's down
But who's sticking around to pick him up from the ground
Rebuild, renew, we fam' we crew
No matter whatever you do I got love for you Lou'
And all the baby mama drama add stress, I know
But you gotta be around to watch your little girl grow
And I'm absolutely confident you'll handle your biz
Louie ain't dead yet but y'all talking like he is

[Hook]
Morning's dark, cloudy and grey
Here am I, nothing to say
Morning sky, cloudy and grey
Here am I, nothing to say

[Jus Cuz]
Morning's dark, cloudy and grey
Here am I, nothing to say
Morning sky, cloudy and grey
Here am I, nothing to say

[Hook]
Morning's dark, cloudy and grey
Here am I, nothing to say
Morning sky, cloudy and grey
Here am I, nothing to say

[Outro]
Morning sky, cloudy and grey
Here am I another day
Empty day, you gone away
Empty room, nothing to say but...
