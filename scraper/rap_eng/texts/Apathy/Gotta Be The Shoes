"Walking ooooh"
"It's the shoes (the shoes?), it's gotta be the shoes"

[Verse 1]
There's something about the way Michael Jordan designed 'em
Only describe 'em as so fly I'm sky born
Mine are majestic, they look just like they way they sound
Spit shine, black cotton leather all the way around
Untied, I wanna see myself carte blanche
Tongue's out, let me glide from the free throw line
Dumb high, that's my state of mind, 1995
Somebody step on my luxury, somebody dies
I enter the stage and they blink like (yeah!)
Let me hold one in they ear and get a pick (oh yeah)
They can catch the hat, flip it back, y'all staring
I could dance on the ceiling like ozone I feel it
But I ain't running ball with these babies, you crazy?
Cause they look so good, if I could fuck them I would
And my closet on display, I got a lot there that's buzzing
But I just want more pairs of 11's I don't care about nothing

"Walking ooooh"
"And I'm a Nike head"
"It's the shoes (the shoes?), it's gotta be the shoes"

[Verse 2: Apathy]
It was like magic
My man [?] made me a sneaker addict
When Nike had the orange tags, shit was so classic
My whole life metamorphosed before my eyes
It blew my mind how he had his kicks so organized
The jump man logo, I swear to the fours and fives
When Nike made his sneakers, Jordan was immortalized
It's more than kicks, it was a way of life
Rakim had them high top ups, the grey and white
Girl, if you clean my Nikes you could probably stay the night
When life's shitty, I buy kicks to make it right
I pray I don't gotta fight or I'm gonna pay the price
Oh wait, psyche, I got the same pair on ice
Everybody gonna clock me, jocking my new Huaraches
I'm cocky
Throw them shits away when they're sloppy
Learn how to rock 'em right or switch to Asics
You fucking cornball, you better loosen up them laces
