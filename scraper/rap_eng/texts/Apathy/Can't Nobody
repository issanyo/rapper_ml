[Hook: Sample]
Can't nobody love me Like you do
Can't nobody love me Like you do

[Verse 1: Apathy]
This reminds me of Junior High, back when we used to slow dance
I would feel up on your booty, till teachers lifted my hands
Girl's notes got passed in class, hand to hand
But you flip on them chicks like 'that's MY man!'
High School we were fronting, like we really would fuck
But most of the time we kissed, while I was feeling you up
And it took you a little while to get used to my crew
But can't nobody love me like you do
And I was making lots of cash so I get you that bag
You put my phone in your name, cause my credit was bad
You knew me before Apathy, when I was just Chad
Then only used my real name, when you really got mad
Everything that we went through, we've come so far
It's impossible to fit it in in 16 bars
There's a couple times I almost quit, like we were through
But can't nobody love me like you do

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ryu]
Yo, I smell like booze, cigarettes and fast food
And spend every cent of my check on liquor and tattoos
I cuss around kids, say fuck, faggot and bitch
You never seem to get pissed that I make you watch Fox News
We used to chill in your Civic in front of J's [?]
Kissing and sipping and still you ain't sick of my face
My African queen only part black is the maximus booty
Ass like a trunk of an Acura stuffed in a pair of jeans (sexy)
The sex was great despite what I was working with
You told me not to trip and said I was a perfect fit
You're much more than a face and a set of perky tits
You cuss more than a sailor with Eddie Murphy's lips
Don't ever leave and I promise to never cheat and bone
Nobody but you and maybe Catherine Zeta Jones (hot)
You know I'm kidding, I'm drunk and I get crazy nuts
Let's get naked and work on a second baby, cause

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tak]
I never saw the face but I heard a voice gleam[?]
The night she left a message on my answering machine
Man, everything folds I was half-way in the dream
Long-distance phone number on my caller ID
Soft marsh mellow tone, needles[?] in my soul
I was nervous and I couldn't handle this one on my own
So I sat for a minute, till I gathered up the nerve
See my passion for women doesn't match with the words
But I dialed anyway and got connected, sooner than expected
Said that she was into spinning records
Coming out to Cali just to spend a couple of days (days)
B-Boys summon up at UCLA
That's where I met for the first time
Curly brown hair with a body that would burst my
Wet green eyes, I don't care where she resides
Melrose and Fairfax took a taxi cab ride (ride)
