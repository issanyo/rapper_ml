[Verse 1: Apathy]
You don't understand the ramifications you gambling with Satan
I'm standing in place and it's like the planet is shaking
Cause all I gotta do is sit with a pen and write for an hour
I develop psychic powers that'll frighten you cowards
Take your Benjamins and strike your kite with lightening showers
Folded dead presidents, reveal planes striking towers
Tell the petty "get ready", 'cause the beats is so heavy
We'll flash flood your city and level your pitiful levees
Let 'em live? Never did, killed 'em on the spot
Base is like an earthquake breaking building on your block
Y'all are children, I'm your pops
Y'all are bragging about your gwap
I get knots you do not so it's like a paradox
Put spikes through your head like a triceratops
You don't see me sharing mics like fiends don't share they rocks
Don't be bitter you bitch started letting me hit her
I'll have her home by two then shout you out on Twitter, peace

[Hook] x2
You're face to face with the best that ever did this
The way it never gon let, the rest forget this
We in your city, you best to get a ticket
Because the shit is about to get ridiculous

[Verse 2: Planetary]

[Hook] x2
You're face to face with the best that ever did this
The way it never gon let, the rest forget this
We in your city, you best to get a ticket
Because the shit is about to get ridiculous
