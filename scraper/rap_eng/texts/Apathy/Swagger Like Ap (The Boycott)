(Verse 1: Apathy)
I ain't even gotta brag 'bout my swag, fuckin' fag
Charismatic, there you have it, Ap's got it in the bag
Thank my mother, thank my dad, cause maybe it's genetic
But you probably stay pathetic cause you can't pay to get it
I don't say it in my raps cause nine million rappers
All run around talkin' about they got swagger
So run away, Ap'll make your stunna shades shatter and
I reduce crews down to anti-matter and
No one on the corner got swagger like Ap
That's a motherfuckin' fact, do the math, add the track
Then subtract all the wack, I'm the answer every time
I'm sick, radiate me, there's cancer in my rhyme
You'll be pukin' on your shirt, yeah I'm stupid, I'm a jerk
In the booth doin' work, pullin' humans in the dirt
You can try to do the same but it's not a good look
I'm impatient, I ain't waitin' I just rap over the hook, cause
No one on the corner got swagger boycotted
Like I got it, like I dragged it in the street, and then I shot it
And they still sayin' swagger, please I don't buy it
The only time I swag is when I'm drunker than a pirate
And all y'all insane, could y'all refrain
From rockin' them cheap chains and singin' like T-Pain
They make me wanna vomit how they bullshittin' musically
They sound like a robot going through puberty
No one on the corner got swagger like they used to
Swagger like Slick Rick, swagger like the Juice Crew
Naturally, Apathy oozes it, uses it
Fuse with it, if you get it, y'all are just confused with it
That's so unfortunate how y'all are forced in it
Like it's tied up in the basement so you can torture it
Hov said it, that was cool, then it turned corporate
Used to be fly 'till you faggots made a corpse of it

(Apathy talking)
I think you got it confused. When I said "Boycott the word 'Swagger'"..
I didn't mean boycott swagger. I'm talking about the word that these
Corny, fake motherfuckers kill in every other line of their rap
And they don't even know what the fuck they're talkin' about
