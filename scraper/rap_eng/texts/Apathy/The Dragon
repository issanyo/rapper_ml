[Intro]
Hold your breath. Make a wish. Count to three. Count to three
The dragon

[Apathy]
Ayo we eat like kings with a lot of gold rings
And the fancy things that the royalty brings
And the real young girls who just wanna have flings
We ain't doing too bad for a couple Earthlings

[Blacastan]
Oh course the lord rides in on a horse
Entertained by the jesters all up in my courts
"Sire, change into your evening attire
The dragon from the hill lit the village on fire!"

[Apathy]
Cause once upon a time when the poems didn't rhyme
And the only crime was stealing jewelry that shined
There was once an old man who was plumb out his mind
Lived high in the mountain where the goats don't climb
Had a cane, couldn't hear and it seemed he was blind
But he could see the future and the fate of mankind

[Blacastan]
Only one man can send a dragon back where he came
The power of a shaman summoning rain
With a thunderous bang which smothered the flame
Then peace was restored to the village again

[Apathy]
And so the arrow that he aimed at the dragon's brain
Hit blood like lava when it pumped through his veins
And everybody in the village thought he was slain
Till a huff of black smoke puffed up from his fangs

[Blacastan]
The dragon! People started running and gasping
Arrows started bouncing off his head, what happened?!

[Apathy]
I'm so puzzled
I thought he was dead for sure

[Blacastan]
Somebody hit the wizard and kill him once more

[Apathy]
This is war
Stories from the old folklore

[Blacastan]
So shut all your windows and lock all your doors

[Outro]
Hold your breath. Make a wish. Count to three. Count to three
