[Verse 1: Esoteric]
I’m getting that feeling, I feel like ripping and killing
Until my system is filling, until my diction is illing
Until I drip penicillin, until I’m victim and villain
And vilified as a vigilante Avengers [uncanny of vindication??]
The only verdict is vengeance, a vanguard
And you should know the inspiration it be V for Vendetta
I’m back and lethal as ever until my people eat better
There’ll be no peace in my letters
The speech a Desert Eagle, the beat’s a Beretta
I’m George Carlin balling both evil and clever
My terror vision is that religion and nepotism
Free separatism of church and state that’s Eso’s wisdom
We Wachovia, you can bank on it
I’m a nightcrawler, daywalker, bright scholar might holler
Old school alright ch'all-er
Fuck you white collar backstabbers, I stand over Anne Coulter
Sankofa take it back, Land Rover painted black
I got a son on the way, I’m knee-deep in this game
And I ain’t running away, I’m here to stay
Tomorrow’s never promised so you know we never fear today

[Verse 2: Termanology]
What’s the verdict? Vicodin mixed with VSOP swerving
Very smooth, very calm, very determined
Can’t tell the difference between a video vixen bitch or a virgin
Fuck a radio version, spitting from the curb and
I’m violent as the Vikings, swords, like Uma Thurman
Rode through your slum village with a .38
Popped you in your carrot top, have you leaking V8
The blood that pump through these veins
Is that of a veteran, he’s crazed
So vote for the villain, hop out the V-12
Rocking velour, bumping Louis Vuitton don while I’m robbing the store
Scrape off the VIN number, go and get my mask
Semi stashed, back to the lab, bangin' that Vinnie Paz
I put men to silence, don’t get tossed in a van over your little wallet
Face turning violet
Y’all some baby ballers, careful when you spend your dollars
I’m like a mix of Van Halen and Don Gotta
You better dead the violence before you feel big pain
Like Voletta Wallace, y’all gonna make me vomit

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse 3: Trademarc]
Y’all want violence or vengeance? I was made to attack
Your remnants bear little resemblance
Like amendments after Patriot Act
Erase them like brittle descendants
I want the president’s widow collecting severance
In attendance as the window of his Yukon glass smash
Upon a bullet’s entrance, move on like veterans
Villainous half the time in Saudi villages
Mixed with that rage is violent volatile ways of victims, pillagers engagers
Trained killers is paid by the weight of the blood on their blade
I got pages of weapon-grade verses
I’m Vincent Van Gogh dash Rambo with desert ammo
With a band so Sid Vicious
We’re suspicious of laugh-track Vince Vaughan rap act cash rats
I’ll backtrack victory lap-style and blast that
Till you been gone and wipe the piece till the prints gone
Victor Vaughn you, if I’m picking on you guaranteed [?] just sitting on you
[?] upon your racks as I’m ripping all new tracks
Y’all rejoice cause my lines in rhymes will hit like Vader’s voice
You’re more James Earl Jones, I’m more James Joyce

[Verse 4: Apathy]
Y’all can probably make the cover of the Village Voice
Little vegan with Vans on, the Volcom boys
Barely born in ‘88, the whole style is very fake
But you swear you’re straight cause you want some Voltron toys
Your hoodies are very vibrant, front like you kind of violent
Cultural vulture, Colt .45’s convulse your vital organs and vibrate
Like an old pager
I remember vividly buying a tape of the Vapors
I’m vicious as Decepts, burying you six feet
Make you dance like Vance White to Slick Rick beats
Verbally Kurt Vonnegut, the verses I vomit are genius
I’m out of this world, a vocalist standing on Venus
(Vainglorious!)
V’s for Vendetta, y’all are vaginal
As men who drive Volkswagen Jettas
So while you’re lunching on your lavish vacation
We attacking where you staying in a V formation

[Scratching]
