[Intro]
And now the hands of time
Are slowing down on this old clock of mine
And it’s no secret that we all must die
Sooner or later we’ve all got to die

[Hook]
‘Bout to go y’all, been a pleasure to know y’all
And I’m letting you know
Pack your bags, get your records, start rolling out
I’m letting you know it’s been a pleasure to know y’all
‘Bout to go y’all, been a pleasure to know y’all
And I’m letting you know
Pack your bags, get your records, start rolling out
I’m letting you know it’s been a pleasure to know y’all

[Verse 1] [Vinnie Paz]:
I wrote my first rhyme twenty-one years ago riding strong
No fame, no money, am I grinding wrong?
But if I’m grinding wrong look at all the time that’s gone
I guess I gotta find another way provide for mom
I don’t wanna think that all I did was all for nothing
I like to think that every single fucking song was something
But dumb motherfuckers taking money out my pocket
Make it mean I wanna get up on the stage and rock it
I know that y’all naive, y’all ain’t ever made some hot shit
You think I’m rhyming for the love and not to make a profit
I don’t know a single person that don’t like money
But y’all download my shit and take it right from me
And I ain’t really never learned to do anything else
Whether rhyming with the fam or rhyming by myself
No y’all, Vinnie rhyming for the dough y’all
Got to go y’all, it’s been a pleasure to know y’all

[Hook]
‘Bout to go y’all, been a pleasure to know y’all
And I’m letting you know
Pack your bags, get your records, start rolling out
I’m letting you know it’s been a pleasure to know y’all
‘Bout to go y’all, been a pleasure to know y’all
And I’m letting you know
Pack your bags, get your records, start rolling out
I’m letting you know it’s been a pleasure to know y’all

[Verse 2] [King Syze]:
Who the rap master? I blast past the sky
My craft match the gods, the cash pass through prize
Let’s break it up, third for you, third for me
According to Gs, niggas leave you slaughtered in freezers
Just what I see, let’s get rich or stay crippled
On the cover being broke seems like the same issue
A chokehold got green enough weed?
Lack of cheese making niggas start playing MCs
Please, my real calling is ? my eye
Since my last dropped in whatever happened to Syze
Fuck free, no dough please don’t ask for flow
Work sixteen hours seen my family grow
So please don’t judge like he ain’t shit
I got four records, y’all demoed, y’all ain’t shit
The pharaoh costs money man y’all ain’t this
I can’t afford to help y’all out, get off my dick

[Hook]
‘Bout to go y’all, been a pleasure to know y’all
And I’m letting you know
Pack your bags, get your records, start rolling out
I’m letting you know it’s been a pleasure to know y’all
‘Bout to go y’all, been a pleasure to know y’all
And I’m letting you know
Pack your bags, get your records, start rolling out
I’m letting you know it’s been a pleasure to know y’all

[Verse 3] [Apathy]:
So what if I quit? Nowadays record sales ain’t shit
And I did it for the love so long that I’m sick
Yeah Hip Hop’s the heart of me
But y’all wanna plug your iPods in my arteries and drain my artistry
No matter how hard an indie or a major market me
I’ll die like a martyr till the governor pardons me
And we stay focused to guide y’all out of the darkness like Moses
But I don’t think you know this
So even though you say we’re the dopest shit is hopeless
Your crops been cursed with the plagues and locusts
Been rocking with Vinnie for eleven years
And now I feel with this Hip Hop shit the end is near
It’s like seeing a family member you deeply love
Comatose, took to machines and covered with blood
Like this can’t be real, everything feel bugged
And you gotta make the decision to pull the plug
Rest in peace

[Hook]
And I’m letting you know
Pack your bags, get your records, start rolling out
I’m letting you know it’s been a pleasure to know y’all
‘Bout to go y’all, been a pleasure to know y’all
And I’m letting you know
Pack your bags, get your records, start rolling out
I’m letting you know it’s been a pleasure to know y’all
