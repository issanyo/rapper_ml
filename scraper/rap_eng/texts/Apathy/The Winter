[Verse One]
I can see frost in the corner of my window sills
Dirty cribs, blunt guts where the indo spills
A bitter chill from shovelin' snow
Hustlin' blow and Ecstasy pills to pay electricity bills
It's winter time you see it in my facial features
It's like a parallel hell where Satan freezes
The reason we tremble and embrace our heaters
The season where Timberlands replace our sneakers
The trees look so wicked with no leaves in it
Degrees so frigid that it freezes liquid
And I start up the whip can't just jump in it
Gotta let that shit run for like 15 minutes
The summers too short, winter's already here
It feels like it lasts 80% of the year
Something in my mind snaps every single time
That its winter time (winter time) winter time

[Hook] [Blue Raspberry]
Come around my way and see how cold it gets you won't forget (No!)
Come around my way and see, how cold it be, the cold's in me
Come around my way and see how cold it gets you won't forget (No!)
Come around my way and see, how cold it be, the cold's in me

[Verse Two]
Rock stars fly by in the nighttime skies
When the winds cover the earth and everything dies
We know how to stay on the grind like snow plows
Wild weather turns cities to virtual ghost towns
Hard hittin' as boxing with frost bitten hands
Snowflakes drift to the ground and gently expand
It's like god spread coke on the mirror to blow
And icicles grow on every single inch of your soul
We see it both ways as an adult I give no praise
When I was a child I would pray for snow days
Sick, sippin' chicken broth, water and OJ
Faking like I'm sick when I really feel okay
To get outta school there ain't a reason better
Try waiting out for the bus in freezin' weather
Something in my soul dies every single time
That it's winter time (winter time) winter time

[Hook] [Blue Raspberry]
Come around my way and see how cold it gets you won't forget (No!)
Come around my way and see, how cold it be, the cold's in me
Come around my way and see how cold it gets you won't forget (No!)
Come around my way and see, how cold it be, the cold's in me

[Poison Pen]
Put your hood up and rock to this, rock to this
Put your hood up and rock to this, rock to this
It's wintertime you got to just, got to just
Put your hood up and rock to this, rock to this
Put your hood up and rock to this, rock to this
It's wintertime you got to just, got to just

[Hook] [Blue Raspberry]
Come around my way and see how cold it gets you won't forget (No!)
Come around my way and see, how cold it be, the cold's in me
Come around my way and see how cold it gets you won't forget (No!)
Come around my way and see, how cold it be, the cold's in me

[Poison Pen]
Put your hood up and rock to this, rock to this
Put your hood up and rock to this, rock to this
It's wintertime you got to just, got to just
Put your hood up and rock to this, rock to this
Put your hood up and rock to this, rock to this
It's wintertime you got to just, got to just
