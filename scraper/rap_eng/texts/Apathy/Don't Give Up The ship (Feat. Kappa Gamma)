[Verse 1: Apathy]
Underwater where the bodies are hidden
I’m living in deep inside a sunken ship where skeletons drifting
Amongst blood hungry mermaids who feast on sailors
And impale them with harpoons stolen from whalers
I’m the Kraken attacking I’m dragging you deep in the ocean
Where the oxygen exits your lungs and your eyes are exploding
Whales exhale songs of old
Where the lost pirate gold that an old pirate holds
In his cold dead hands or so I’ve been told
Still searches for his ship that his shipmates stole, whoa
Land ho! rum barrels and hoes
Crows picking eyeballs from the skeleton bones
Trunks full of pieces of eight, beaches in sight
Outlaw types like Edward Teach teaches to fight
Hijack Boston yachts, lick off some shots
And let their bodies sink down to the lobster pots
I got Sperry's on, captain on the decks why we carry on
Out on Block Island till the very last ferry's gone
With the whole picture etched in scrimshaw
Pieces of a ripped up map fit like jigsaws
Drunken scallywags singing Apathy’s joint
Ship docks and find a wife out at apogee point
Subterranean, sonar blips songs from whales
A gun bottle of rum and mug full of ale

[Chorus: Kappa Gamma]
In the early morning sunlight rays of the dawn
Set sale on the sea, anchors up and I’m gone
Skulls on the flag, blood on my map
With a yo ho ho and a ho on my lap
Like, HEY YO OHHH OHHH
HEY YO OH OH
Like HEY YO HO HO
HEY OH OHHHH OHHHH

[Verse 2: Apathy]
I make waves move like a full moon
I make the ocean rock, call me Neptune
I scale sand dunes on a pale beach
Watch the birds flock where the whales breach
I take money, bury money on deserted islands
I’m perverted smiling as Circe and the Sirens
I was raised in a village full of violence
Where old blind men sing for shillings with their violins
I’m Leviathan, the ocean that you lying in
My posse stay pirating the waters y'all are piloting
Old ghost tales, ships without a crew
The Flying Dutchmen will scare the shit out of you
I’ll throw you off my schooner without your scuba suit
My ship will loop the loop and find another sloop to loop
Cannons loaded to shoot crew full of criminals
Stranded on an island of savages doing rituals
Skulls full of soup, human heads get shrunk
You can’t pay off a cannibal with gold in a trunk
Dead men tell no tales, you all get hushed
No parrot on my shoulder cause they talk too much
From a tavern to a cavern where doubloons are kept
I got a very detailed map that shows each step
Which I keep around my neck hidden in a medallion
Where I write a whole album on a Spanish Galleon

[Chorus: Kappa Gamma]
In the early morning sunlight rays of the dawn
Set sale on the sea, anchors up and I’m gone
Skulls on the flag, blood on my map
With a yo ho ho and a ho on my lap
Like, HEY YO OHHH OHHH
HEY YO OH OH
Like HEY YO HO HO
HEY OH OHHHH OHHHH
