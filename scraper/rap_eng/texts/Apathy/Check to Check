[Verse 1]
I'm trying to read between the lines, show me how the war's won
Rich dad, poor dad, I just had the poor one
Call me Charlie Bucket, attitude is fuck it
No golden ticket so I'm balling on a budget
And rap money's bullshit, nothing like it used to be
I used to be used to Gs, blew through them foolishly
And fuck a nine to five, I live life for rocking these mics
The only time I wake up early is for court dates or flights
I'm living check to check, but I ain't talking Nikes
I'm leaking money like BP with oil pipes
It's funny how it makes you feel like you ain't a man
Trying to justify why you making payment plans
I never made it cause I never tried to make you dance
I'm making ends meet, while Diddy's making bands
I want to thank my fans, the ones that show respect
I'm like projects in Prague living check to check

[Hook]
To the end of the week, I live by the beat like you live check to check (x3)
If you don't move yo' feet then I don't eat, so we like neck to neck
To the end of the week, I live by the beat like you live check to check (x2)
If you don't move yo' feet then I don't eat, so we like neck to neck (x2)

[Verse 2]
I never trick on some bitch, cause tricking's for the weak
The only way I make it rain is cause Ev' did this beat
I'm sitting in my car, reclined back in my seat
Phones about to get shutoff and I ain't even eat
I'm waiting so long for a check from a song
By the time I get to cash it every penny of it's gone
Gone baby gone, I'm trying to stay strong
If it wasn't for my family and my friends I wouldn't be around this long
Like me and Louie used to live off only Little Debbies
'Cause they only cost a quarter, can't afford a penny more
To get a value meal
Wish somebody would've taught me how to deal
But I ain't talking about trees, or keys, or blow
I never knew how to be responsible with my dough
I radiate being broke, you almost see me glow
I'm the Incredible Hulk of blowing money for show
And so I rock the show to make my empty pockets grow
I'm contemplating changing jobs if the money's better
Cause making paper off rap now is tougher than leather
I love music forever, but we can't stay together
I told myself I'd never ever ever ever ever...

[Hook]
