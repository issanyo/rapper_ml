[Hook-Scratched by DJ Kwestion]
The Ultimatum, let's abbreviate em
A.O.T.P
The Ultimatum, let's abbreviate em
You can't fuck with the army

[King Magnetic]
The ultimatum ain't debated, ain't the same as when you waitin'
For someone to keep their word or the paper from a payment
Ain't negating nothin'
I can break their front and take it from them
Wait a month and take a pump and make 'em want to make up somethin'
Take an up-and-coming artist
Or classic figure
If you see me reaching out, it's to smack a nigga
Melanin scheme is telling 'em squeeze, shell an MC to breeze
Ease G', tell like Aviv
Felony three on melody schemes
They selling them dreams
DMX is Nelly to me
Tellin' 'em please, just leave
Before I have to swell a person
It's no question like playing the a capella version

[Des Devious]
Look I said it before, shouldn't say it again
But in case you hard of hearing look you and your mans
Can get it in the worst way, run when killers thirsty
For a lame and his blood
Sweep it under the rug
Just like it never happened, we professional fighters
And I ain't talking about scrapping
I'm talking pistol gripping
You know the rest, no need to, stress how my niggas live it
Just know we go so hard, for dough and lavish living
And since I had my taste can't find nothing that's better
Ridin' high gripping wood, ass on the softest leather
Oh, y'all some scary dudes? Man I ain't afraid of you
Murder you, crack a brew and watch it on the news

[Reef The Lost Cauze]
Get stabbed by the cuts on the Kwest beat, respect beef
Marty McFly shit, get knocked into next week
What does the future hold? Bullets going through your clothes
My niggas is all large like a Jewish nose
Hold more arms than a hookah bowl
Y'all motherfuckers ain't been nice since the Eagles won the Superbowl
Check your stat books, get your rat hooks
Out my rap books, biting-ass niggas get your snacks took
You in the scrapbook scrap shook
Y'all niggas think beef is what these dudes type on they Macbooks
I'll smash your Hewlett-Packard
You fucking doofus rapper
A.O.T.P. fuckers, it's the newest chapter

[King Syze]
Catch me in the street dressed pretty as hell
But when it comes to these raps I get gritty for real
Knock 'em out the box Syze
I spin your motherfucking head counterclockwise
Y'all niggas is not Syze
You full of shit like a pot pie
Labels better cross them T's, dot them I's or them shots fly
Pass the Master, have to blast you
Chokin' the track like please excuse the asthma
Please excuse my French, fuck the Spanish
Talking ghetto language the hood can understand it
A wrath of God, Satan; fuck the apostles
Army of the Pharaohs back ready to rock you

[Vinnie Paz]
Vinnie fucking smash your jaw
It ain't nobody rapping half as raw
I was writing rhymes over loops by Stacy Lattimore
Guess you wondering what Vinnie need all the assassins for
Guess you wondering if I'm a communist or fascist bol
Shoot three at you and push the rock like this was basketball
Chop your body up in little pieces with my plastic saw
Y'all need to overstand the jux is real
I run with ghetto boys and I ain't talking Bushwick Bill
If looks could kill then y'all would be kaputs for real
We drink your blood and hang your body up on hooks of steel
I push the pills, call me Vinnie the psychiatrist
And y'all are gonna have to see defeat like a podiatrist

[Celph Titled]
In the dice game you say I won't place those bets
That's like saying you know the Wu, but call that dude Ghostface Deck
I leave your whole face wet like you got hit with a water balloon
The size of a propane jet
Altercations I took place and no police was involved
If I'm beefin' we ain't greetin', I'm deleting you, pal
I keep my weed in a jar
And roll it in a Philly wrapper
I'm A.O.T.P. so I roll with Philly rappers
And will kill a rapper
Don't believe us? Try us
We the illest out believe it I'm not biased
At best you're a rookie
Your show's like a Catwoman audition
'Cause we'll see who plays the best pussy

[Planetary]
It's the ultra (ultra)
Magnetic like I'm seven foot
Outsmart your art of rhyme though I've never read a book
Off with your head, you shook in the corner shiverin'
Delivering a dosage of the most potent Ritalin
You must be kiddin' nigga, this ain't no Kid 'n Play
More like N.W.A
Fuck you kids gonna say?
Hola Hola aye
Oh God hold my trey pound
You rap clowns sit around in broad day
Broad Street Bully rap
Yo Kwest you took me back
To the scuffed trees and the Champion hoodies in black
I blacked out
Snap in a packed house
The gallon of Jack's out
That stout got my passed out

[Apathy]
You can't take the word on the street from a bird on the wire
And you'll never hear the truth in the church of a liar
Real men converse, you prefer to conspire
Give it a year you'll be the first to retire
We don't roll with snakes, we curse a pariah
You're mad at your people over earthly desires
You don't believe it? Just peep the verses
Presidential, we roll deep as secret service

[Crypt The Warchild]
Too many niggas claim they O.G
But most of them won't approach me
Catch me everywhere, my niggas like to play low key
I'm mostly surrounded by apes, gorillas
Out of a broken home so they label us hateful niggas
Never take a nation of mills, it takes a killer
On medication chasin' their pills with haze and liquor
Bad lieutenant in a black whip, black shottie
Dragging a safety net only 'cause we catch bodies
We act snotty and rap godly and clap loudly
They don't want hardcore 'cause they fags probably
I don't make shit to make you want to paint a canvas
I spit fatal language only to cause pain and anguish

[Journalist]
Don't bring drama to the old-timers
When it calls for a time you catch Alzheimer's
And turn into Carl Thomas
I'll pack a Llama
Separate the lions from llamas and alpacas if I pow pow at ya
Ali bumaye
Zoom by clappin' ya
Wound guys, the room guys, Mumbai massacre
Verse so raw I'm trying to tell ya
I'll salmonella poison any these boys in the path of the craft
Lean on the Craftmatic
Paralyzed from ass to your calf
Half radish for half of the cabbage
Five and a half hours, dime bags is sour
Get twisted, niggas get high as the Comcast tower
Lifted
Like a dumbbell, inhale; your lungs swell
Whiff of the piff bury the gun smell
Either you run well, the shells stick in you like a thumbtack
Pistol clip you like a thumbnail
Won't get caught for a thumbprint
The lawyer eat the case like roast
Deploy you and your boy, ain't payin' one cent
Hide your charms
Firearms, will rip through the bone and the marrow
It's the Army of the Pharaohs
Check

[Hook]
