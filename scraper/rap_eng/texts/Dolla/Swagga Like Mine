Don't make me go on my bad shawty
Meek Mill stay down boy
Ahuh you know what i'm talkn bout
Ey easy I got this shit no problem
Easy No Roise
Clips hang on my dick so back up nigga (back up)
I Don't wear skinny jeans cus my Glock don't fit
And I Think it's gay

Swagger Mick Jagger Rock star statues
Red and blue diamonds like cop car flashes
He be wearing fake shit his neck got Rashes
Hit the blunt shake the dice then pluck my ashes
Rap valedictorian Don't know where class is
But I be in the trap cus I know where the cash is
Niggas can't see me not even my ad-libs
Better get glasses or contact lenses
Cus I am G like the kid on the benches
I Hope she Got a long neck, So I Can stuff my inches
Nut all in her face and leave swagger for rinches
Rules for this shit we got swagger commendments
Go Hard till you die and never slack a instant
Show haters no love and watch it burn like insent
Swagger never leaving like a lifetime sentence
Your man's a girl scout he should be sellin' thin mints
