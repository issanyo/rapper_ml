[Intro]
Yeah (yeah) ya talking about, it's like 2:12 in da am
I'm in L.A right now working on my mixtape
I got pussy on my mind (pussy on my mind)

[Verse 1]
I need a bitch that suck dick by the pound
When I nut she lick it down
Get up and get a towel
Wipe me and wipe me down
That's my motherfucking freak
That's why she always around
If I wasn't in the lab we probably be fucking now
Pearl tongue licking, nipple sucking, ass smacking
Now she jumping up and down on my dick
I could see it in her stomach
Now she peaking starting to run in
As I pull her closer to me
I could tell it's getting good
Cause she screaming "This yo pussy!"
Now we sweating, ass naked
Took a breather for a second
Took out my Ne-Yo
Play my R. Kelly record
12 play I could say
I get more butts then ash trays
But her pussy's inspectable and that is on a bad day
Sliding in and out her
Got her legs on my shoulders
Got my hangs around her neck
I slightly chock her
As I stroke her
I could tell we getting closer
She biting on the pillow
Body shaking like a seizure
As I proceed to work the middle pussy killa


[Verse 2]
Can we cum at the same time
And really get connected
Pistol right there on my dresser
So you know your well protected
Hot her playing with her pussy
I don't touch her I just watch
Rub my fingers on her clit
And move it in and out her twat
I'm as hard as a rock
Yeah she begging stick it in
But I'm like you gotta work
Before you get this dick again
Let me see your back bend
Like it when you work it out
Like a bitch that eat a bitch
I think it's time to turn you out
Kiss each other in the mouth
Open up and stick it out
Open up and spread her out
As you eat her I'm a fuck you
Baby how does that sound?
I know we sound terrific
Now they asking me who's is it?
I smirk and I reply
I'm like"Neither one of ya'll bitches!"
This lifestyle is vicious
When you young black with riches
Hoping out of benzes
Plus they know you with the business
Confusing love with lusts
Getting hard could tell the difference
So I'm only trying to fuck
I ain't tryna kick it
