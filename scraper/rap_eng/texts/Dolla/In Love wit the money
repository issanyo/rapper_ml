Verse:
(Wiz)
The moment you start touching that money you fall in love with it
Doing anything you could
Could never get enough of it
Hustling is a must
In this dirty game and theres  no one you could trust
And them problems adding up
I just stack the money waiting for a holler
Enjoy why you get it here today gone tomorrow
So wen It comes the money I just try to pace it
Spend all make it quick cause it's hard to save it
So when the monies calling you know I got to pick up
The conversation is Money and that don't never switch up
So when I throw it out I make it back double
So when it comes to money I don't never have trouble


Verse
(Caine Curse)
Okayy
Said you leaving where you going for the summer
Now it's snowing stressing
Got me smoking now a nigga focus
No more flowers was no more roses
And the models that you love no more kisses no more hugs
Do that little thing with your tongue uhh
A fallen in love with the money
It was there when you was acting funny
Now you gone and things don't feel the same
I got all this on my brain saying you'll never change Dam
Free my nigga twin he got three
Since U left the Shit been fucking with me
Free my nigga twin  he got three Sence  you left the shit been  fucking with me
Huuuu
