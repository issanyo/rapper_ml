[Chorus: Dolla]
For all my niggas locked up
Waiting for ya'll to Pop up
Haters like to watch us
Cops Can't stop us
Let Em Free Homie (x4)

[Verse 1: Dolla]
Dedicated to my Sister, She locked behind the wall
Everyday she get out, that's the day we gone ball
They can take away your freedom
But can't lock up your mind
From the same blood line so I know you fina shine
You my Daddy first Daughter, My Mama first seed
If a nigga disrespect then a nigga gotta bleed
And you know I Got your daugher, you know I Got your son
Gave birth to your own so your legend just began
Keep the money on your books, to make the load lighter
And em bitches in trouble, My mama raised a fighter
If I Could I swear to god I be right there withcha
But I can't so you need to know I miss ya

[Chorus: Dolla]
For all my niggas locked up
Waiting for ya'll to Pop up
Haters like to watch us
Cops Can't stop us
Let Em Free Homie (x4)

[Verse 2:]
This for everybody in the nation, Black and Caucasian
Know it's hard out here when you out here paper chasin
George Bush can't give a fuck, his eyes will agree
We got our troops over seas, doin' shit we don't need
Got 25 to life? Keep your head up
P.O's on your ass know your getting fed up
Mo Niggas in the pen that there is in college
In the ghetto all a nigga know to learn is fucking violence
When you come to ?, Letters ain't coming
Baby mama get to trippin' it's hard on a woman
And If I Could I swear to god I be right there withcha
But I can't so you need to know we miss ya

[Chorus: Dolla]
For all my niggas locked up
Waiting for ya'll to Pop up
Haters like to watch us
Cops Can't stop us
Let Em Free Homie (x4)
