I Done seen a lot on the road to money
Shot at, shoot back, lost a couple homies
Wish I could bust at you and take it all back
I Hustle til I exit baby riding where my soul at
On the highway to money
On the highway to money
On the highway to money
On the highway to money

So tired of the fake shit, tired of the talk
Pistols I popped and niggas I fought
Bitches I fuck and cases I cought
Money I made and the money I lost
Dope I sold, cars I drove
Seen this street shit all I know
Feel like I'm forever gonna be on this road
Feel like I'm forever gonna be at that sto'
20 Years old, I done did it all
What they did this summer I was doin' last fall
Duragg bread niggas I ain't got no flaws
Walk around this muthafka like I'm 10 feet tall
It ain't the dog in the fight it's the fight in the dog
You can get it on call, rather big or small
Back against the wall Imma grab my balls
Middle finger to the air nigga fuck all y'all
Took niggas in showed niggas how to eat
Taught niggas how to floss how to cop that V
Took grown ass man put 'em under my wings
Did it all for the love I ain't asked for a thing
Niggas fall off give em work to get back
Where they falling off at I can pick up they slack
Get rid of them packs, treat niggas like kin
I was so young then Imma grown ass man

I Done seen a lot on the road to money
Shot at, shoot back, lost a couple homies
Wish I could bust at you and take it all back
I Hustle til I exit baby riding where my soul at
On the highway to money
On the highway to money
On the highway to money
On the highway to money

Did mo for a nigga then he did for himself
I Was always there if ever you need help
You was hurt I felt whatever you felt
Turn nothing to something play the cards Im delt
Better watch your step, learn to wak lite
Them dogs bark loud but them dogs don't bite
These niggas so fake look up in they face
Bout time a real nigga put them in they place
Feel my fate I'm destined to be great
Rather rappin' of the weight that money that I made
Penitentiary chance that a young nigga take
I Would never fold bend or break
Imma be straight don't mean no squad
Just me and my faith, grace, pray through to a lot
Every blessing I get every lesson I learn
Every bitch I fuck and every block I burn
Money I earned pot I turned
Street certified and that's confirmed
I am not concerned what none of these warrant
Under any pressure Dolla Bill stood firm
I Ain't gonna lie I did that there
That spot you in I been stood there
Always here, front line with it
All Day long nigga come get it

I Done seen a lot on the road to money
Shot at, shoot back, lost a couple homies
Wish I could bust at you and take it all back
I Hustle til I exit baby riding where my soul at
On the highway to money
On the highway to money
On the highway to money
On the highway to money


Roddy we miss you....
