[Intro]
Yeah...

[Verse 1]
Can't right now
Can't right now
Can't right now
I gotta go, no time to smack that hoe
So I gotta go bro, oh no, i'm running low on time
Can't keep up this rhyme
There no more
No time, bro
Can't right now
Can't right now
Can't right now
I gotta go, no time to smack that hoe
So I gotta go bro, oh no, i'm running low on time
Can't keep up this rhyme
There no more
No time, bro
So tell that hoe to go
Bro

[Chorus]
Where do we go from here
When we know it hurts
But we just can't seem to let go
From here
So work things out
But we both end up hurting
And it seems
To disappear
Cause the love we had
Just ain't no longer here
And I'm lost
On a road
With no speed limit
A heartbreak collision is near
Don't pull me over
Oh I just can't take it
I just can't take it
