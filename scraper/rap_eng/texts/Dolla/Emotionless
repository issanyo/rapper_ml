Just Woke Up, Top of the AM
Word on the Streets niggas tryna slay em
I Can't blame em I got hard for them gangs
They want me out the way cus they can't maintain em
But I'm acquainted with the killers and the bangers
Dope slangers got money out the anus
Bitches all on my penis
Cus Dolla bill a gangsta ya mans a ballerina
Young hyaena no roof on the Beamer
Got the swag of a boss with a dope boys demeanor
Before this rap shit, I was street famous
Tryna knock us out the way cus they can't maintain us
But that ain't change it's dolla bill still hangin
I can have a nigga gone with the snap of my fingers
My advice is don't anger us
I Can give you wings turn you into a angel bruh
See all these bangers up, a 100 shooters with me
Hit you niggas from every motherfuckin angle bruh
From the ankle up have you all dangled up
You out of menice I think it's time you hang it up
The clock tickin ol' nigga start snitchin
Tellin On a young boy he ain't wanna see the prison
But he ain't wanna see his misses
Imma have the bitch swimming in the east mississippi
Play with me I play my part and take your heart
You just a fish swimmin around with the great shark
I Play clark kent superman shit
A 100 birds relay just a underhand pick
Statin' here in my stan smith
Every second I get I thank the lord for the gift
Statin' here in my stan smith
Every second I get I thank the lord for the gift
Yeah, knowimtalkinbout
My Emotions aside
The streets shits a fool man
Keep your feelins in your heart

LONG LIVE DOLLA
