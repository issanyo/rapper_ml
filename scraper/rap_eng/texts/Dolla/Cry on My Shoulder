[Hook:]
You can cry on my shoulder
I know its hard when them nights grow cold, stressed out, need somebody to hold you
You can cry on my shoulder
Heart ache only gonna bring us closer
Its a war outside ill be your soldier
You can cry on my shoulder
When the world start to turn you away
I got a place and you welcome to stay
You can cry on my shoulder
Don't be ashamed ain't nothing wrong with you cryin
Don't worry bout it everything will be fine
You can cry on my shoulder

[Verse 1:]
13 years old and the daddy was fuckin her
Only time she feel love when somebody was fuckin her
And now I'm stuck with her
Gotta build trust with her
Somebody call the governor or maybe the coroner
She out there on the ave sellin ass on the corner
She need to go to church and get the lord in the corner
She said he ignore her
He never respond
I said you gotta communicate and that creates a bond
I keep open arms baby
You're never alone
I know its hard out here
By yourself on your own
Take your time baby girl don't you rush to be grown
As long as i'm around you got a place called home

[Hook:]
You can cry on my shoulder
I know its hard when them nights grow cold, stressed out, need somebody to hold you
You can cry on my shoulder
Heart ache only gonna bring us closer
Its a war outside ill be your soldier
You can cry on my shoulder
When the world start to turn you away
I got a place and you welcome to stay
You can cry on my shoulder
Don't be ashamed ain't nothing wrong with you cryin
Don't worry bout it everything will be fine
You can cry on my shoulder

[Verse 2:]
I know the world can be a hard place to live in
Especially with the racism and the killings
Drug dealings
And corrupt politicos
That reality pill, its hard to swallow it
I've acknowledged this
Harder on the good women
Cus half the niggas gay the others in prison
And the very few good ones dog you out
And the others with a white bitch ballin out
It comes together now
I see why you so pissed off
The only time you get attention when ya panties off
But you's a blessin bay
I need for you to understand
God created you as a gift to a man

[Hook:]
You can cry on my shoulder
I know its hard when them nights grow cold, stressed out, need somebody to hold you
You can cry on my shoulder
Heart ache only gonna bring us closer
Its a war outside ill be your soldier
You can cry on my shoulder
When the world start to turn you away
I got a place and you welcome to stay
You can cry on my shoulder
Don't be ashamed ain't nothing wrong with you cryin
Don't worry bout it everything will be fine
You can cry on my shoulder

[Verse 3:]
I was raised in a single parent house
See my momma was my daddy and the leader of the family
I know about tragedy and heartache I promise
Niggas shootin at eachother
Nothin new i'm bein honest
A funeral like every week
Familiar with the service
Too familiar with the sermon
Somebody call a surgeon
I got a hole in my heart
I hope i'm livin for a purpose
You hear about the pain but i'm seein it in person
I need some reassessment
I feel like we experiments
Put us on Section 8 like a form of endearment
We have to build pyramids
With unity and trust
Penetrate an opportunity the rest is on us

[Hook:]
You can cry on my shoulder
I know its hard when them nights grow cold, stressed out, need somebody to hold you
You can cry on my shoulder
Heart ache only gonna bring us closer
Its a war outside ill be your soldier
You can cry on my shoulder
When the world start to turn you away
I got a place and you welcome to stay
You can cry on my shoulder
Don't be ashamed ain't nothing wrong with you cryin
Don't worry bout it everything will be fine
You can cry on my shoulder
