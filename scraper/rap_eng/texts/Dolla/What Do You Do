[Intro: x2]
Another day in the skin of a young black man
Tender age of 25 Is the average life span
We rather sell dope or rob than work For the white man
That's why there's less nigga in college and more nigga in the can

[Verse 1:]
We so use violence it ain't never silence
All we hear mommas cryin cause death rates keep multiplyin
And crime seem more easier to get into instead of some big institute
That's why I'm out here hustlin grindin for my family's food
Fuck you type of attitude always got a gat or two
I work too hard for what I got I ain't with them jackers move
Crackers do whatever to disrepect us
They rather see a rope around my neck than my diamond necklace
Get The Message "Don't push me I'm close to the edge", I confess
We drank or smoke weed or pop pills to ease the stress
Cops killin niggas off every other arrest
"like we don't pay our taxes and we ain't here to protect"

[Chorus:]
Why just show me then try to take it
It's the same old story but ain't shit changin
What do you do, trouble leaves then it's back again
What do you do, do you fight it or let it win, what do you do, start
Talkin and sick off drinkin but to stop the pain and start the thinkin
What do you do, trouble leaves then it's back again
What do you do, do you fight it or let it win
What do you do

[Verse 2:]
It's easy to get a gun than it is to get a job
So we result to goonin lookin for someone to rob
And gang affliation got me ridin on the back streets
I'll be godamn if one these bustas catch me
Reality's a muthafucka but in life's bitch
Tryna find a women with morals and common sense
And confidence that she can one day install in my kids
I'm involve in the streets it ain't nothin I ain't did
Shotguns that come equiped with the velcro strap
It'll knock you off your pivot and a pussy nigga back
Better hold it can't control it fuck around and hit a stray
Where we grew up look around and you see j's everyday
Like we play for NBA but we choose to sell yay
Young niggas stressed out tryna smoke the pain away
Waitin for better days prayin not to fade away
Hope the feds don't kick me door and take a young nigga away

[Chorus:]
Why just show me then try to take it
It's the same old story but ain't shit changin
What do you do, trouble leaves then it's back again
What do you do, do you fight it or let it win, what do you do, start
Talkin and sick off drinkin but to stop the pain and start the thinkin
What do you do, trouble leaves then it's back again
What do you do, do you fight it or let it win
What do you do

[Verse 3:]
R.I.P. to Sean Bell, Emmet Till and Oscar Grant
And to my father cus died due to tardy ambulance
He could of survive but shit they choose to take they time
Cause we was livin in the hood where niggas totin that iron
One time for my single independent black women
Workin two or three job to provivde and make a livin
Baby daddy's either deadbeats or locked up in prison
Neither way to help her out so it don't make me no different
She got to raise children on her own and be strong
And somehow turn that broken down house into a home
Turn boys into men and make daughters feel safe
The presence of a father just something you can't replace
Our brothers get mislead and involved in the streets
Our sisters get knocked up then the cycle hits repeat
We knee high deep in problems and we need to start fixin
Before we let this end we got start ton pay attention, Nigga

[Chorus:]
Why just show me then try to take it
It's the same old story but ain't shit changin
What do you do, trouble leaves then it's back again
What do you do, do you fight it or let it win, what do you do, start
Talkin and sick off drinkin but to stop the pain and start the thinkin
What do you do, trouble leaves then it's back again
What do you do, do you fight it or let it win
What do you do

LONG LIVE DOLLA
