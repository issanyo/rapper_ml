[Verse 1]
My home boy got life, gettin hard for me to look at em
Feelin like it's my fault, judge throw tha book at em
His momma call me son, his sista call me brotha
We was eighteen gettin it, chevys all colours
Super far from a sucka, he ain't neva tuck his tail
On the east of Atlanta givin these sucka niggas hell
Get caught go to jail, I would later make bail
Hit tha trap on tha same chic back to the mail
Get a rat, lay it down we was tossin em up
Any nigga talk shit we was boxin em up
Shoot dice, talk shit til the sunlight come
Get bored start shit, boy we so dumb
We be laughin on the phone bout the thangs we done
Askin the lord why he lock em down so young
I shoulda told Cuz chill, he'd prolly be free
Shoulda set an example cuz he was lookin up to me

[Hook]
Hey I can be ya role model
Life ain't all about the club poppin bottles
For what you need, gotta learn how to follow
I can be ya role model
Forget tha trap, all tha 9's an tha choppas
Insted of gangstas we could use some more doctas
I can be ya role model
Fuck bush or whateva you wan call em
And id rather be fixin old problems
I can be ya role model
I know you grown, you can do what chu wanna
What a man is a father to a daughther
I can be ya role model

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My sister been two years since the feds, had a baby before she left
She send me my nephew, swear I love em to death
Momma raise a good nigga, ain't have a father figure
Only niggas I knew was rappers an drug dealers
Pretty good at tha rappin damn good at tha trappin
So bitch where would I've been if my daddy was a actor, doctor, lawyer a teacher, a judge
Prolly never seen this trap shit neva touch the drugs
I be in tha strip club throwin money like it's nothin
I should try an start a business an invest it into somethin
I be callin brothas niggas, I be callin sistas bitches
Sometimes I sit think, the fuck wrong wit me
Smokin an drinkin to destroy my mind
Need to get back to school and try to clear my mind
Live right, get a job, or some kinda degree
Set examples for kids that look up to me

[Verse 3]
I told em bout sellin drugs cuz that's what I've done
Talk about bitches an hoes cuz I know some
I ain't talkin to all women but a bitch is a bitch
If ya call yourself a women you ain't offened by this
Grown man havin babies, spendin money on weed
Knowin god damn well they got mouths to feed
See I call that a nigga, that's some ignorant shit
45 in tha club cuz he scared to commit
Got the nerve to say pimpin, time to give that up
There's somebody always lookin tryin to be like us
An these young black men mimickin rap songs
While the niggas in that rap neva live that song
Neva seen that jail, neva walked that line
He went an told on somebody he was scared of tha time
Live right be a man, I call that G
Set examples for niggas tryn be like me
