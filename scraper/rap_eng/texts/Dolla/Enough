VERSE ONE:

I’m a writer, I swear to God I’m fire
We lighting up the bush
I’m like Moses moving higher
Closing than you think
I’m degrees from Mr. Carter
Playboi make me leak
Ice only the one with water
Pussy popping ain’t only way to get the money
Dollar bills hit my account, made it sunny
My art change the weather
Giving Drake with the Views
Clouds come thru
Before the good news
I move around like, AHDH DO
I look around like who got the tool
Pull a Chun li, Mans head screwed
Wasn’t the bad guy till he asked for the nudes
Whoa, I’m talking shit. Ain’t I?
Aura so colorful, they call me 69
Diamonds in my teeth, say shine instead of hi
Weed is the spaceship, calling Martian for the light
I Stan like Eminem
I want the M&Ms
I mean the billions
Don’t forget the trillions
They coming in my pocket so I get the win
Stop using all the blessings as a way to get to sin


Chorus:
I am enough, I’m enough 4x


VERSE TWO:

Am I crazy?
Shit, idk
I think about it every time I switch up my flow
Skipping out on sleep
Need the check, I gotta go
Money rule the world?
Well bitch welcome to my show
I am the dollar bill and my moons in Scorpio
I am the head bitch. Yeah I do this solo
This is a sport bitch better run the slow mo
Yeah we run it up, then we reverse the flow
Niggas wanna play dollas
But don’t have a cent
Yeah We sent from the fatha
Having heaven lit
Where she get that cash
From ya fucking father bitch
Haters tell on themselves
What a fuck snitch
No sugar but I’m dada
Call me uzi, cause I rara
Turning down ya baby fatha
Wow
He just wanna kiss my nana
If he Don’t see the value in it
Make me ponda

Chorus:
I am enough, I’m enough 4x

Bridge:

Dolla Bills hit my account make it sunny
