Let's make a toast
We ain't never going back to being broke
Everyday stay stacking up the dough
Let's make a toast
(Let's make a toast, woah, oh)
Yeah, let's make a toast, let's make a toast
How she popping when she drop it down low
I just whisper in her ear move it slow
Let's make a toast
(Let's make a toast, woah, oh)
Yeah, let's make a toast
Were getting paper like a billy goat
Remember being really broke
You should see my safe boy
That thing look like a jewelry store
Money grow like chia pets I just gotta get it wet
Stretch it out like spandex
We don't rent apartments
We gonna buy the complex being broke is nonsense
I don't get the concept but understand the context
Money on my conscience money on my mind
$100, 000 on the watch
Who said you can't buy time?
Let's make a toast
We ain't never going back to being broke
Everyday stay stacking up the dough
Let's make a toast
(Let's make a toast, woah, oh)
Yeah, let's make a toast, let's make a toast
How she popping when she drop it down low
I just whisper in her ear move it slow
Let's make a toast
(Let's make a toast, woah, oh)
Yeah, let's make a toast
Yeuh, gimme a tall cup of Pimp C
Medicine man bitch call me M.D
Yeah! time hating niggas cheers
Young Money get em boys waiting in the rear
Ha, ha, throw some money on the bitch or something
Hot car outside like the engine running
Yeah, and well I can't bet my cash 'cause
Hoes you better keep my glass full
Shit they wanna know what kinda high I'm on
Tell 'em play that Styrofoam like a xylophone
And not to brag or boast but I got that bread
And I get that toast and I keep that toast, yeah
Let's make a toast
We ain't never going back to being broke
Everyday stay stacking up the dough
Let's make a toast
(Let's make a toast, woah, oh)
Yeah, let's make a toast, let's make a toast
How she popping when she drop it down low
I just whisper in her ear move it slow

Hey, make a toast to the Benjamins, Chaloupas in the dividend
Fettuccine pasta and all the other synonyms
Women I be swimming in Carolyn and Marylin, Virginia and Savannah
It feel good to be American
I done hit the cities and left jackals in the ambulance
Chilling in your house, waiting on you like I'm brother, man
When it come to the money I don't under I overstand
Middle finger in the air bottle in my other hand
Let's make a toast
We ain't never going back to being broke
Everyday stay stacking up the dough
Let's make a toast
(Let's make a toast, woah, oh)
Yeah, let's make a toast, let's make a toast
How she popping when she drop it down low
I just whisper in her ear move it slow
Let's make a toast
