I got a flock of fly women
I'm feelin myself, feelin myself, feelin myself
Think a nigga lost his pistol how I'm feelin myself
Feelin myself, feelin myself
I make my own damn money
I'm feelin myself, feelin myself, feelin myself
You ain't gotta feel me homie
I'm feelin myself, feelin myself, feelin myself

Well I'm a A town resident, cocky and arrogant
Feelin myself like I'm off my own medicine
Nuts of an elephant, dope boy stamina
I ain't takin pictures, I'm too cool for the camera
Flossin on you niggas like a boss, yousa amateur
Blame it on your manager
I run my city
I ain't talkin marathons, I am not P. Diddy
In the coupe lookin shitty
Doo Doo brown interior
Follow the leader nigga, ten steps ahead of ya
Diamonds on my neck sing a song to a hoe
Jack me right I stay strapped like?
I tell em go and they go

I got a flock of fly women
I'm feelin myself, feelin myself, feelin myself
Think a nigga lost his pistol how I'm feelin myself
Feelin myself, feelin myself
I make my own damn money
I'm feelin myself, feelin myself, feelin myself
You ain't gotta feel me homie
I'm feelin myself, feelin myself, feelin myself

Get familiar with the style
Get familiar with the swag
Get familiar with the pizzazz, me showin my ass
Get familiar with the chain flooded loaded in cash
Every car got a stash in the dash
Every chick thick with an ass
First one to blast
Ask questions later
Fo Fo mag
How a nigga dress to hater
No mass on the caper
I ain't pressed for paper
Duckin' vestigators
I'm cooler than a fridgerator
Sweeter than a Now n Later
Gang get it poppin'
Make the haters feel the vapors
Dolla the hood favorite
That weak shit save it
I'm Feelin' myself I got the whole block achin

I got a flock of fly women
I'm feelin myself, feelin myself, feelin myself
Think a nigga lost his pistol how I'm feelin myself
Feelin myself, feelin myself
I make my own damn money
I'm feelin myself, feelin myself, feelin myself
You ain't gotta feel me homie
I'm feelin myself, feelin myself, feelin myself

He think he the shit
He think he the shit
He think he the shit
Hell yea I do
He think he the shit
He think he the shit
He think he the shit
Hell yea, don't you?

Eh what you know about goin' out down south ballin' out
DVS all up in the niggas mouth
Doors liftin' up rooftop comin' down
Dolla goin' up why these hatin' niggas comin' down
Settle down tell them niggas calm down
The prince in the building
Everybody gather round
Got a story to tell about how I feel
My swag, my style, and my goddamn self
Cause I'm cool
Cooler than a fan
My shoes, my shoes cost a grand
She choose cause shit I'm the man
Better get with a nigga that can pop a rubber band

I got a flock of fly women
I'm feelin myself, feelin myself, feelin myself
Think a nigga lost his pistol how I'm feelin myself
Feelin myself, feelin myself
I make my own damn money
I'm feelin myself, feelin myself, feelin myself
You ain't gotta feel me homie
I'm feelin myself, feelin myself, feelin myself
