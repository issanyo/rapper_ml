[Verse 1:]
Before the fights start to kick off
I always used to trick off
And keep her in designer bags
To have her girls pissed off
Ridin' with the top off
They don't ever go out
And if a n*gga pop off
You know I'm a show out
You know I'm a show out
Yeah you protected
And all of my EX's gotta respect it
You too young to get in
But I was connected
So the bouncer at the front
Let her enter through the exit
Five minutes before we get in
My song get requested
And we start throwing hundreds
Til all the strippers get naked
Damn we used to kick it
Now we disconnected
I thought we was different
But we ain't no exception
Late night texts
Keep us arguing
Used to be running through my mind
Now you're jogging
Now you're just walking
And footsteps lightly
Until they start to fade away
And all I hear is silence
But it ain't here never after no attachment
Used to be amazing
Don't know how that happened
Used to say I love her
And I would really mean it
Now I'm sitting thinking
Trying to comprehend the meaning

[Hook:]
Where do we go from here
When we know it hurts
But we just can't seem to let go
From here
So work things out
But we both end up hurting
And it seems
To disappear
Cause the love we had
Just ain't no longer here
And I'm lost
On a road
With no speed limit
A heartbreak collision is near
Don't pull me over
Oh I just can't take it
I just can't take it

[Verse 2:]
Before our love starts to tear up
I'd rather get the hell up
To focus on my rock collecting check
And get some [Miller]?
You used to fix your hair up
Put on clothes and make up
Used to put it on me
In the morning when we wake up
Used to cook and clean
And do laundry on occasion
Now you sit around the house
And I'm running out of patience
Got the nerve to be complaining
But the bills stay paid
And they ain't never late
And I ain't never laid
A hand on you
That ain't what men do
My momma taught me well
Snow boots by Chanel
She getting every fall n*gga
It'll never fail
If money every funny
Bet you she can never tell
Unless I ever told her
Just to show her what it was
Like I'm out here doing all of this sh*t here for us
But that ain't no longer here
Cause we no longer there
We looking for commitment
That we no longer share

[Hook:]
Where do we go from here
When we know it hurts
But we just can't seem to let go
From here
So work things out
But we both end up hurting
And it seems
To disappear
Cause the love we had
Just ain't no longer here
And I'm lost
On a road
With no speed limit
A heartbreak collision is near
Don't pull me over
Oh I just can't take it
I just can't take it
