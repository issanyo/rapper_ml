Aye welcome to the jungle this is right where I grew up at

Re-package it, re-step it, then I sell it back to ya

Problem with me homie ima FOX 5 channel you

Momma tell me settle down boy before they call the man on you…

Im from the east ….momma created a beast
You think I was preacher the way I stay with a piece
But nigga I ain't, Im not a muthafuckin saint
If this shit get ugly I be lookin 4 a chain
My brothas are hyenas my niggas ain't ballerinas
Thats more like you and yours I got the pictchas I seen ya
A muthafuckin fool, I took my pistol to school
A straight bad ass I never followed the rules
I stay with my heat so I can’t keep cool
None of us carpeters but all of us got a tool
Just yo body wanna operate, when I discombobulate
Call you sugar ass cause yo blood is filled with Cho-ca-late 
Sweet ass, Must I repeat that, you pussy and a see that
Lame I neva be that
Nigga I ain't scared of ya
Put 10 in yo interior
Put bullets in the air like malaria, send em in ya area, BITCH!
