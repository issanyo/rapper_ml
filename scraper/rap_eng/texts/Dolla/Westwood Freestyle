[Verse 1: Ghetts]
I concentrate on the constant wage
Conversate with the man dem about deep shit
Only we can contemplate
I read books for the content's great
These bars and these hooks I often spray
Might be overlooked, nobody ain't doing it on my level
I'm raising the bar like it's got lightweights on it
I'm like [?] the bodybuilder
I tell an MC "nobody feels ya"
[?] oh Jesus, silver
Haze I blaze might kill ya
Could've been a great midfielder
Before my lungs were in need of a filter
By the way, if them man are fly
Then me and this brudda on the right
We must have [?]
[?]
Fortune when I walked you
I could afford to, it's all true
Yes, when you buy one I would've already bought two
I used to be a loose baller
Wasting money in Lakeside and Bluewater
And it was all due to a huge order
I ain't gonna get into when, where or how
Or what could occur when we're about
Need I say more? We breathe the same air
Eat the same food, beat the same [?]
I've got my own team but I don’t trust them
So I might feel the need to take yours
Some man say they're making it rain
Trust me, they ain't seen the rain pour
Check the forecast when I walk past
I've got the power to create a storm
And the calm before it, see this cold?
Can't ignore it, see these shows?
I wonder if anybody really knows
All the answers, sure isn't easily known
But the bars are flawless, yo
And if you're an MC
And you think to yourself that you're on the same level I'm on
Then I be going up another level

[Verse 2: Devlin]
Hold on, T, I’m on top of this
I’m on my feet like a chiropodist
Running a metropolis
You'll get left in the rain
Simply claim that you ain't got the foggiest
No way could you imitate me
I'm lyrically way too complex to copy this
And I be going in with the bars
Since school days when I saved work on a floppy disk
But now I write rhymes for a wage
Every day like a newspaper columnist
And it's fair to say that I've got a vast following
Because I regurgitate bars I can vomit in
And you ain't got a clue what I'll do to your crew
I'll unscrew your face like halogen
And if his name ain’t ‘Zilla and he think’s he’s a dog
Somebody better collar him
You like me living Big Brother
Don’t like [?] then [?] your mum’s mother
My bars are hard like Giggs' album cover
And after I'm gone, never never never never
[?] I'm a grime MC
I've still got mainstream music down to a T
There ain't no one as rowdy as me
Get burned to a thousand degres then shipped to Calcutta
You'll face deportation
Escorted to hell by four freemasons
Left 24 hours a day
In a cell with the shadows of Freddy and Jason
Don’t know what they think that they're facing
I'm like dark, man, I'm faceless
Old T-style mosh pits in the rave
And if you don't believe me, ask Chase & Status
But this year, I'm changing my status
I'll throw cracks in the game like craters
And when I get chance to make money
I don’t think twice, like hungry alligators
Haters, hoard of eradicators
With their envious eyes
But it's funny in life
You come across man that are live
And some that are stuck up their arses like vibrators
So say this, I don't give a fuck about a C list or A list
Just make sure you've got my record in your playlist
[?] but your brain is
I woke up from a nightmare, dead
With a map that led to where Dracula's grave is
Now I know where you suckers all rest
I'll return with a steak that's infected with rabies
And I'll impale you on it like Vlad the Impaler
Let's talk war like JD, my mind tricks on the track
Known as a [?]
You won’t like what you see like an angry fan or spectator
The day you invade my space, you're in danger
So don’t get too pally
[?] in a movie, the perfect stranger

[Verse 3: Lil Nasty]

Don’t wanna rumble come a better than them

[Verse 11: Ghetts]
Everything’s splashed
Even if it better been set
Nobody you’ve been see so they added ghetts
Got a better boy memory
Elephant said:
You know who am I at?
Or I’m suit it graims tii
I don’t care what are the veterans said
I woke up today
Shave my face with a remeton inch
I’m go my minedom
Up in and seems that that stayed outssmarted some intelligent friends or leave or not teach with a skeleton rest
I’d been a villan
I kill him
I kill him
I kill him like Devlin said
Yes!
I’m the worst nightmare
They better sleep or there they’re will repain in that
Cause another war ain’t beregain hand and they may be you that I beregain next
Look
Peak came to the clast for the man deep
Everyone had their manner in pee
Everyone that bad did pees in that
I can’t be simple but affective
And all I know I do is in lessons
It’s not that too hard
It’s far for an impossible task
This are block claps
For a double old bars
Said a I want an Irable
Every time my  man freezes the runna ain’t sure that drake founds that that over cool loves
Pah!
Joker, I won’t play  the comeback cue card
See
He ain’t  ending a league
That’s right
I said it is not a new star
I beat to sick to the feet is in the jeans as biological dog
Man attempt month but they really get plant
I might play they innocent hand so wouldn’t they scam?
But they only with their young cam
Put now off I can pull off the trillion fun
The only killed are OS clam
I’m sick about the a steak a named Sam
Many chase and a bunny let it and a fresh then I ran shows and I’m a hot when its carried moe
Hurry home
Dam, dams seat I dam his bones
Unlucky homes
Are more schooled like a runny nose
Shop on the stage while I sweep
Well I don’t need that to that pee show
And ain’t nobody is hard to beat cell
If you see me with a floppy or he now I saw crick while like come-way-go
Back to the boss, so man they can get amazed where my taste that I can’t relax anymore
The road too get known by this enemy till my fits may be cause I’m carrying in a sword
Dead man walking and the sabadge chicken way so the waste so the gates so my guns so my merigan oh!
Non-stop let her no fill for a troe black bags sup suck like a tapicked store
But I rate no close them
Just spoeted hate for them
1,2,3
Lose for them
4,5,6
Let’s get close for them
7,8,9
Let it reload again
I’m stone cold, my face think they got some motion in
Fogs know when comes to the beast
From zero cause scared when the floor since here
Hands in the air when I mind I  appear
Sometimes I way cop like damn my career
I’m schooled chop some thousands affair
The rain I minded affair
Cause I can a mand   as a pear
For A MAND bee aware
Man they would do that clap beat
Keep going no light
You don’t act til the quail but I swear
They left the whole family scared
You see that the sunny is clear
Picture that like a gallery quail
Forced when you…
