[Intro:]
Yea Yknamtalkinbout
Mane It's Ya Boy Dolla Ya Heard
East Atlanta Trappin, West L.A. Gangsta
Man I can't leave these streets I love 'em too much

[Verse 1:]
Son to niggas like I skeeted in they momma
A-Town paper Chasin dolla after dolla
At the p.o box adressin problem After problem
Bitch I'm from the A and that's the bottom of The bottom
We don't know our manners cause our momma never Thought 'em
Niggas tottin hammers cause we out here starvin
I heard he Brett Farve (in) A-Town ballin
He ain't seen them Goons He's to busy hot doggin
Look at here darlin I'm sunday Morning
Eazy No Stressin That's Eazy No Stressin
Take a knee and thank the Man
Get Eazy off the dresser
That's Eazy No Pressure That's Eazy No Pressure
We too busy get money we ain't worried bout recession
Too damn depressin and I'm countin every blessin
Learnin every lesson I got it no question real street nigga no fakin no flexin

[Chorus:]
My momma can't get no sleep, my sisters always worried bout me
It's like I can't leave the streets cause it's always gon be part Of me

I'm tryna change tho
I'm tryna change
I'm tryna change, I'm tryna change

[Verse 2:]
Free niggas know the pedigree, lame I'll never be
On the road to riches got a lot of shit ahead of me
Self evaluatin learnin how to be a better me
They don't compare to me another me there'll never be
Cause GOD he Carry (Curr) me they could never bury me
I done seen the light patna you can't scare (scurr) me
Niggas try to spare me shots don't purge me
Askin for respect nigga he ain't fear (fur) me
In the hood daily cause I love that dirty
Check your card heard you die rarely
Real bad boy call me Mike Lowrey
Ball like barry, cheese like dairy
Tinkle bell niggas cause they just fairies
M.O.B 4 life to money I'm married to the hood I love to the
Set I claim to the top we went from the bottom we came

[Chorus:]
My momma can't get no sleep, my sisters always worried bout me
It's like I can't leave the streets cause it's always gon be part Of me
I'm tryna change tho
I'm tryna change tho
I'm tryna change tho
I'm tryna change
I'm tryna change, I'm tryna change

[Verse 3:]
No struggle no progress
That's just part of the process
It's for my niggas in the projects stuck in that complex
'Bout time I pay homage
Speakin dope boy ebonics never seen college
Still somethin like a chemist
The way birds flip still somethin like a gymnast
Numb your whole mouth nigga somethin like a dentist
Twist a cigarillo fill it with the spinach
Pass it all around let my lil niggas hit it
I be round the world in my A-Town fitted
Nigga you ain't heard this is A-Town Business
Sure not a gimmick and I'm sure not timid
You could lose your life in a New York minute
Where the niggas play the trap and the women climb poles
Where your homies grandmomma got a fresh pair of gold
Adios! Goodbye, Goodbye Adios! [x4]

[Chorus:]
My momma can't get no sleep, my sisters always worried bout me
It's like I can't leave the streets cause it's always gon be part Of me
I'm tryna change tho
I'm tryna change tho
I'm tryna change tho
I'm tryna change
I'm tryna change, I'm tryna change
