[Verse 1: Dolla]
Got the cash and the pistol off the dresser
On my way to make a mil and I ain't takin nothin lesser
Then my cellphone rang it's my freak bitch Venessa
She work the pole good and bring a young nigga pleasure
Met her a Latonya, Put the bonus it was shakin
Look I got that cali kush that have you feelin like jamaicans
She said she get off later after 9 and we can blaze it
I Said ok that's cool just hit me up I'm gone be waiting
Now We all up in my residents, smokin plus drankin too
Playin Speakerboxx Love below you know the pink and blue
Thinkin bout that pussy tryna beat it til it's black and blue
I just might even eat it let me see if it's on static too
Now who thefuck is grind, when I'm done he gone be mad at you
Have you cookin breakfast, turkey bacon hey it's scrambled too
Imma terminate it as if Arnold Schwarzenegger Do
Had that pussy percolating and sanging for a day or 2

[Hook: Lloyd]
I'll See you tonight, I know a place we can get away
You and me... where I can show you every car that you never seen
The Life I lead makes me believe
?

[Verse 2: Dolla]
I think these niggas think I cook on her
Barley even lick on her
Only when I'm faded
Look I'm here to put this dick on ya
She had a girl I told her cool we can keep her
She ain't really into men I told her I don't like them neither
In this cool pussy I just wanna stick my key in
Stand up 5"9 Half black and Philippine
Said I'm livin like a movie pick a role and you can be in
Be my Lauren London, We can roller skate
We can spend a day with the trap I snake
Nah bullshittin keep my money where it's suppose to be
Right here in my pocket far from you but then it's close to me
Payin how it's oughta to be, crime here is stalkin me
Never seen the day a piece of pussy ever alter me
Look I'm stupid cold take a feel I Can prove it
Come take a night with me twist a blunt and we can do it
Your body is an instrument I wanna make music

[Hook: Lloyd]
I'll See you tonight, I know a place we can get away
You and me... where I can show you every car that you never seen
The Life I lead makes me believe
