[Chorus]
The drugs on every side
Supply and demand, yeah
Now run straight home
She don't want you goin' 'round there
Now you should know, I raised you well
I taught you better
It's never gonna end well, never gonna end well

[Verse]
Them cold nights on the corner
Patrol the estate like wild packs
Them loud claps bring about order
Keep a some'in tucked south of the border
'Bout to turn up to your house and take your doors off
Boom
Off the 'inges
Shots at the windows
Burn your whole spot down to cinders
Heat for them ice cold winters
The snotty nose been told
Always watch the roads before crossing
Look both ways and look back before flashing
(Shoulda' seen the way) he whipped and stripped the clothes off him
Keep these overdressed mannequin brothers panickin'
Good kid seduced by the dark force like Anakin
Dreams and hopes vanishing, soul damaging
O.G.s weighing up the advantages
Here little homey can you 'andle this?
Council brick, no board tricks, teaching motherfuckers how to flip

[Chorus]
The drugs on every side
Supply and demand, yeah
Now run straight home
She don't want you goin' 'round there
Now you should know, I raised you well
I taught you better
It's never gonna end well
It's never gonna end well, never gonna end well

[Verse]
Yo, yo, them boys ain't running
Plus that young brother [?] shit since they wigged his pops
Out shining in the streetlight
Outlining any beef plus I'm sleep tight
Ice grilling I cold ring
You cobra clutch your whole team [?]
You sold dreams till your friends drop
Those O.G.s don't get no love
Extending his life, suspended in time
Your mind focused, make money money, time's over
Street corners hold weight sinking deep waters
No face, no case, you lean forward, reach for us
Yo [?] mic stress has its face in them shadows
Crabs straight shaking them barrels 'til they toppled it
Four horsemen of the Apocalypse, a flock of pigs
Fly above the metropolis, like some novices
Tomorrow ain't promised, just pray for the sunrise

[Chorus]
The drugs on every side
Supply and demand, yeah
Now run straight home
She don't want you goin' 'round there
Now you should know, I raised you well
I taught you better
It's never gonna end well
It's never gonna end well, never gonna end well
