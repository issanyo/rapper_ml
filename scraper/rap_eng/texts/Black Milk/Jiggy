[Verse 1: Sampa The Great]
Said they call me for the heatin', south side of Africa
Buddha all human, G with those that be the human
Write them off for dinner, feed them to my innards
See my bloodline when I look in the mirror
Better with the stars, I’m better with the scars
I'm better with the mind then put the meta in bars
It matter if they tell that it doesn't end up in hearts
’Cause I bet a bloody bullet when I sped it in yours
Peace, my religion, peace in my vision
Separate the ego from the journey is the mission
Hour after hour, I might need a intermission
I might do it for the culture, seems we need an intervention
For real, I do it for the blood, sweat and tears
And the love, motherfucker, I'm ill, and ya, ya, matter of fact
Pardon all my French, puttin' Zambia on the map
Mama and Dad, [?] and Junior and [?] like that
When we bite, we bite back
Said we'd never make it but we conquered all that
Now we sittin' in the mansion, shoutin', "Nigga, you wack!"
Young, gifted, black

[Chorus: Raiza Biza & REMI]
We keep it jiggy, jiggy, jiggy, jiggy
We keep it wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
We keep it jiggy, jiggy, jiggy, jiggy
We keep it wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy

[Verse 2: Raiza Biza]
Televise the statement, bring the speakers to the party
Tell all of the suits and the ambassadors to call me
Quit the hibernation, you been sleepin' on us softly
Pleadin' ignorance when you already know the story
Gettin’ jiggy, jiggy, jiggy, jiggy (Uh-huh)
That’s why the people in my city feel me (You get me?)
It's only why I don’t think this ozone layer could hold this lie
We don't hear that shit you say, it's overhype
I don't think this ozone layer could hold this lie
I do it for my C’s, my glow is from inside
Ya-ya-ya, more ether
We only scratchin' the surface, there's more deeper
This is for the struggle, the pen of the poor people
This is young, gifted and black like Aretha
Yeah, and that speaker's bumpin'
I only do what I want, I got my feet in the air
Yeah, that trajectory up, I ain't done seen anythin' yet
And I'll be back in November, yo, there's a reason I'm here, oh yeah

[Chorus: Raiza Biza & REMI]
We keep it jiggy, jiggy, jiggy, jiggy
We keep it wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
We keep it jiggy, jiggy, jiggy, jiggy
We keep it wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
We keep it jiggy, jiggy, jiggy, jiggy
We keep it wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
We keep it jiggy, jiggy, jiggy, jiggy
We keep it wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy

[Outro: Sampa The Great]
Young, gifted, black
