[Verse I: MED]
Hallelujah to them true moody look got them unruly
Yours truly, my dollars are made of more choosey
No excuse with the fullies, ain’t a threat to me
Throw stones get two hoes to the Os to your coochie, Lord
She took to me another groupie on tour
Beat it sore, no rookies with the Woody Award
Black cholo off of soul food, slick as galore
Eva and Jada Spade taste the fruits of the war
The winters, we ain’t letting off your neck yet, bet it
So kill a sack off the block like bed it
Started from the crevice, bless, now we up
Black Jetsons, tryin’ become one with the heavens, uh
Who you testin’, my report card raw
Learn your lesson in the morning when you see them scars
Oxnard till the dirty Teflon with the thirty long
Claim street till you meet that tar

[Hook: MED & Guilty Simpson]
Face down, win come around, hit the ground
Face down, nobody make a sound
Face down, still don’t move, but the booth pounds
Money, when I lay them face down
Win come around, hit the ground
Face down, nobody make a sound
Face down, she know the style, ass up
Face down

[Verse II: Guilty Simpson]
Say no more, I’m hardcore
This rap shit is like chores, and with competition, I’m doing floors
Attitude, grew up piss poor
Gripping that four when I’m leaving the liq store, my hits pure
Something like Peruvian flakes
I make you snakes hold your breath till you’re blue in the face
I’m hammered up in the caddy truck
Two-two-three in the GMC you add it up
If I had a penny for each time I sense envy
I would be a billionaire I can feel the stares
Maybe of the escalade, when they get a pair
Until then they talk tough and live in fear
Me and my dog from the Ox
Power moves talking over blocks
You’re mad ‘cause we’re making what you’re not
And never will, our better skills equal a better deal
That’s every time

[Hook: MED & Guilty Simpson]
Win come around, hit the ground
Face down, nobody make a sound
Face down, still don’t move, but the booth pounds
Money, when I lay them face down
Win come around, hit the ground
Face down, nobody make a sound
Face down, she know the style, ass up
Face down
