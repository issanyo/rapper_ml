[Hook: Black Milk]
Yeah
They told me keep it pure
Caught up in the allure
But see that's not what I'm looking for
Wasn't sure
I wanted more

Tell no lies
Tell me no lies
Tell no lies
Tell me no lies
Tell no lies
Tell me no lies

[Bridge: Black Milk]
Yeah
Was born into a hell
So you already feel
They say don't live life on the edge
Man I might as well
Yeah

Tell no lies
Tell me no lies
Tell no lies
Tell me no lies
Tell no lies
Tell me no lies

[Verse 1: Black Milk]
Yeah
Better brace yourself, brace yourself
We're close to the end, save yourself
You out for the money, make your wealth
Move silent, don't waste your breath
Do better 'cause they never taught us stocks and bonds
Only taught designer clothes, gold chains rocking charms
So I hardly paid attention, in my hood you feel the tension
Well I'd rather make it flipping than to go pay a tuition
Always listen when they said to hold your head
Lives ruined
Better days are on the way
But I think they all lied to us

[Hook: Black Milk]
Yeah
Told us to keep it pure
Caught up in the allure
But see that's not what I'm looking for
Wasn't sure
I wanted more

Tell no lies
Tell me no lies
Tell no lies
Tell me no lies
Tell no lies
Tell me no lies

[Verse 2: Black Mik]
Teacher teacher why you keep feeding me false
Information taught is just a way to keep me lost
Said you here to make me brighter but you keep me in the dark
Told me turn the chapter and remember everything you taught
Educated fool that's why we hated school
I guess I'm different, had me venting 'bout my teachers
But my preacher wasn't no different
Mama picked up on tradition of religion, I knew it
Had to break tradition, told mama they lied to us

[Hook: Black Milk]
Yeah
Told us to keep it pure
Caught up in the allure
But see that's not what I'm looking for
Wasn't sure
I wanted more

Tell no lies
Tell me no lies
Tell no lies
Tell me no lies
Tell no lies
Tell me no lies

[Bridge: Black Milk]
Yeah
Was born into a hell
So you already feel
They say don't live life on the edge
Man I might as well
Yeah

Tell no lies
Tell me no lies
Tell no lies
Tell me no lies
