[Verse 1: SINO]

Come on...

Yeah, One two! One Two!

Listen!

Yo..
If it's anything I want
Is to make it in this music
Take it for what its worth
Purposely being the truest
Me and my whole crew in
Stadium mode doing
Show's in the L.O. N..
D.O.N
Hello!
Snacking on Macaroon's
Stacking, making moves
Patiently waiting cool
For the world to catch up to him
Diamond in the rough
My mind is like a jewel
Precious don't second guess him
Mama didn't raise a fool
Therefore!
I'm killing competition in rare form
Extraordinary vocab is Enorm
Us is on a very great path I just soar High
No coming down
My eye Is on the crown
Guided by the sound inspired by the drum
Flow is in the pocket I made it through the slums
I'm one
With every verse
From now until I'm gone
Set trends for the world
Your man has just begun
Uh

[Sample Hook - SINO]

One two! One two!

Easy come easy go

Live! Break it down!

[Verse 2: SINO]

No matter how long it takes
I'm keep going
On every song I make
Keep flowing
Passionately
Until it so happen to be
Pumping through every Bose
Dre Beats for show
Uh!
In every house hold
I charge to take this game to threshold's
Beyond weak droves of average Emcees
No need to get deep
I keep it short and sweet
Peace!
