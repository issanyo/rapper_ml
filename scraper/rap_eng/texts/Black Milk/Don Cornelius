[INTRO]
Uh... yah, I used to move first last
Move from bus routes with a bus pass
Ridin' foreign whips takin'...

[Verse 1: Black Milk]

Uh...yah, I used to move first last
Move from bus routes with a bus pass
Ridin' foreign whips takin' foreign trips in first class

[Hook 1]
Oh, don't go baby
Run and go...

[Continue Verse 1: Black Milk]

Put your lighters up
Used to play the back of either unintended
Now he's in attendance playing front and center
Why you underestimate him
Now you gotta extra pay him extra
If you wanna play him...

[Heist Man]

So what you sayin'?

[Black Milk]

Get riches...

[Hook 2]

If I go baby
Don't...

[Verse 2: Black Milk]

Get bitches
Like my nigga Gib Simpson say
Hip Hop is trenches
Used to role a solo night
Everyone would go and kick it
Used to sit there never sit there
Now I'm sittin' double fisted
Spittin' to these mixes I was missin' for a minute

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3: Black Milk]

Keep your lighters up yah
Take it personal CD where they purchase know
Well a bullet can fly out the window
Where your curtains go
But not for certain yo
If they make it out of here
Everyone wants to be fire but can't ignite the flair

[Hook 2]

[Verse 4: Black Milk]

I love this shit
See... He runs the game like a relay
Still not a game like EA
I'm on the right path like slow lanes on a freeway
Yah, yah you see it
It's a difference when he's present and gone for a year man

[Hook 1]

[Verse 5: Black Milk]

Keep your lighters up
Ride more serious
Line for line more furious
More so Don Cornelius
In a mist Nas just a genesis
While your rein comes to an end
Like an Encore period...

[Hook 2]
