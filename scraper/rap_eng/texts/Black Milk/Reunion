[Verse 1: J Dilla]
Yo El and 'Tin kill'n em, 3 kill'n 'em
You thought we broke up but we was just reassemblin'
Ladies and gentlemen, you bear witnessin
The villa on some classic shit like vans emblems
It's the guerrilla pimps, we bustin denim in the club
That you can't wear your denim in
Freakin a rhyme til every line ends with a then and than
You don't wanna rump and stomp in Timberlands
Shout to my nigga Killagan
And all of my peeps that rep more D than 12 Eminems
Who let the dogs out and let Dilla in?
Fuck with this is ya loss Gilligan
Sounds similar I'm not feelin 'em
Get the balls like Venus in Wimbelon
While I'm in them fly whips five Will and them
On some Kim and them All About the Benjamins
Still here

[Hook]
Still here, never left, just switched the style up
Came through, made moves to get the crowd up
It's hard time, "V" time, nigga, your time's up
Get riled up for the Reunion

[Verse 2: T3]
El killin em, Dilla killin 'em
Maybe we could hook up again back with 'Tin n' 'nem
Together again like armed forces
On some Fantastic Four, Four Horsemen
Can't do it without your crew, boy
Guess who, boy? Comin' through with two boy
Nobody but us, that rap in a clutch
Passed and switched it up like kids in double dutch
Some couldn't feel our style or feel our flow
Never talked our slang, never walked our road
All they know is these niggas is tainted
Don't know about them Rovers that's candy-painted
We been misquoted, misconstrued
Misunderstood and overused
So we take this time to set the record straight
Critics get the di-dick, we did it anyway
Now you hear our raps with Dilla and you all on the team
Till you heard 'Tin was gone, was a part of the scheme
See! We still got love where was you at at?
Cause a nigga go solo, think we turn our backs
Maybe we'a reunite on some shit like that
But I gotta set it straight 'fore you twists the facts, nigga

[Hook]
Still here, never left, just switched the style up
Came through, made moves to get the crowd up
It's hard time, "V" time, nigga, your time's up
Get riled up for the Reunion

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
Yo, 'Tin killin em, 3 killin 'em
You thought we broke up and yeah you right, we really did
I wrote a verse that I recited; it was hot
But I had to rewrite it cause I thought we was united and we not
And though all the love that I got for you
Partner, I picked apart ya words and I'm shocked
In the interviews, I been accused of not carin'
When the city threw your furniture out, it's not fair
When I'm learnin' about how stressed you feel in a article
Forget a rhyme, I'm just as real when I talk to you
And you know that we share Kodak moments
I wish we could go back, but don't act like you wasn't
Buggin' out like a phone tap, chasin' cars in the street
I saw you throw up hard in the sink
Then after hit the bar for a drink, who asked you to slow down?
Even though niggas told me you was gon' clown
But I tried, and you know I cried when I saw you wild'n
At the State Theater, near the door by the side
Went to throw you in the trunk and find a preacher for you
'Cause I thought you had unlawful demons on you
Sinkin fast in the deepest soil
Your parents finally got you some help
You came out seemin' normal, and
I heard you on medication
Had an illness you couldn't heal with herbs and meditation
And believe me, me and T3 kept it low
Don't take it as a diss, this is just to let you know that I love you
But watch the company you keep
Swearin' niggas don't care, but they love you in the streets
Get your mind right, nigga!
