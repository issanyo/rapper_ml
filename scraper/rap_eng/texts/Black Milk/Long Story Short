[Verse 1]
Eight fourteen 1983 nigga I'm there
But let me fast forward about 17 years
Take you back to the basics, back to the basement
Hi-Hat, snare drum, baseline, base kicks
Recording the karaoke, stereo to tape deck
Having fun with it ain't worried bout gettin paid yet
Couple years past now I wanna get paid
And stepped up as an Emcee, stepped up to the MP
Doing beat cd's gettin better bruh
Listening to Pete Rock, Preemo, Dilla on the regular
I'm tellin ya, couldn't +Tell Me Nothing+ 'til my ears determine
Learning how to get my sound
As good as theirs hell yea
I'm about to add a little group then
Ten speed and brown shoe
Lasted bout 2 years
But its more info
My kinfolk went on tour roady for Slum Vill'
He got a beat CD in the hands of Baatin
Didn't hear from til they got back to Michigan
Got a phone call *rings* What up doe?
Come up to the studio, yo we wanna hear mo'
Some I brought some mo tracks and they picked a few of those
And made a little dough, then yo I'm out the door
Is the story over? Not really
Got Trinity, Dirty District, Detroit Deli
I'm thinking how can we fail
Seen a whole other level of the game
Out on tour with D12
Fans wilding out, hands raising in the pile
And Proof keeps stage diving in the crowd
I can do this I can get used to it, but
There's more facts so let me back track
To the B-rack, BR Gunner shit
Hoping we were running shit
But it didn't work they way hey
Young J and my nigga Fat Ray
Dirty District 2 things seemed okay
But it still ain't right
Things are moving slow mo
So I'm thinking bout going dolo
So I had to go and go solo
Doe low and I'm not feeling
Having low doe or close to having no mo
So I'm back to basics so I'm going back to the basement
I'm trying to make it
And I hope the crowd coming with me
I'm grinding out then I made Sound of the City
I'm trying to show bruh's how this bruh do it
Trying to keep my buzz up suited
My buzz in the underground stupid
Phone call from Fat Beats, who dis?
Yo we trying to make you the newest
Artist on the roster, possibility
I'm bout to use this shit to make another outcome
Outdone, popular demand came out
And shout out to the fans that's been holding me down
Now traveling the world gotta get em
Whats next?
Me and Hex on a mission for the competition
Caltroit shout, what up to my nigga Bishop
Hold me down on the West coast laid out
Told him good lookin out on the Dre' shout
Hey now, niggas trying to go and get paid now
Kill em on stage wow
The spotlights not dimming
Fat Ray got +The Set Up+
Share the spotlight with 'em
Critics saying I'm one of the dopest on the beats
Accolades in the page of the magazines
And that's only a little of what I've been given
Still can't believe that it's only the beginning
