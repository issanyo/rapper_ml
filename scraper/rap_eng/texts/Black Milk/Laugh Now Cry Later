[Verse 1]
Yeah, do I see a soul or do I see a fa√ßade?
Either you hurt a happy king, make up your mind
Laugh now, cry later
On a timeline should I hide in a disguise
From strangers watching my highs or my demise
Laugh now, cry later
Evil remains, world ain't really change, moments of feeling anger Next moment you end up changed
Laugh through the pain, my nigga
It'd be those same celebs seeing the stars struck
Same time see them appropriating the culture
Cry later

[Chorus]
I see the whole world changing now, you see my whole world different now
You in the sky, better learn to fly before your spaceship hits the ground
Tell me who should get the crown, you see, this is what you get for now
I see my whole world different now, you see my whole world different now

[Verse 2]
From raps to movies, to black is beauty
Cop didn't feel the same, felt he had to shoot me
Laugh now, cry later
All fun and games, screaming out gang gang
Until lil homie pull up, put a bullet through a brain
Laugh now, cry later
Let me say this
Some niggas fake woke, like they don't have any flaws
Some niggas too turnt, don't represent any cause
Life's a balance, we live in awe
Lanes, giving her your opinion on her persona
My, do your hair, make-up the way you wanna
Fuck a man's opinion
Some people hoping to peel, some hoping to heal
Talking to a profile, hoping it's real, for real

[Chorus]
Us now, we're different now, you see my whole wars different now
You in the sky, better learn to fly before your spaceships hits the ground
Tell me who should get the ground, you see this is what you get for now
I see my whole world different now, you see my whole wars different now

[Outro]
He just said the truth will make us free
Question that we have to ask is do people know the truth
Our condition bears witness they would
That they don't know the truth
