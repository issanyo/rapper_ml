[Refrain]
Wind and sea mix thoughts in my brain
Never know if love will remain
As the sea comes speaking to me
Siren voices drift out of key
Wind and sea mix thoughts in my brain
Never know if love will remain
As the sea comes speaking to me
Siren voices drift out of key
(yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
This little light shines bright now
Even in the room where they had the lights down
Even brighter than a lamp in a light house
You like past curfew when the lights out
I'm like past in the future and the right now
Attitude king always needed my crown
Even out the womb brand new life now
More than what I write down its a lifestyle
Either you stand up or lie down
Keep head above water or you might drown
Sink or swim
Fade to black or
Fade to dim when the days are grim
Play to win
Made for the ages
Not made for the weak built for the bravest
From the most no name to the most famous
Stay true for the stars watch where you aiming

[Refrain]
Wind and sea mix thoughts in my brain
Never know if love will remain
As the sea comes speaking to me
Siren voices drift out of key
Wind and sea mix thoughts in my brain
Never know if love will remain
As the sea comes speaking to me
Siren voices drift out of key

[Verse 2]
Here's something the others can't offer
Uncut and straight from the author
Untouch, escape from the darkness
Escape the land of the heartless
Some of those days was the hardest
The days when homies laid in the coffin
Caught by the hands of the law and
Pour a little liquor out for all them
Never was a stroll in the park when you walk down the street pass those apartments
Window frames behind bars
No front lawn no gardens, regardless
Still had to put my all in
Answer, destiny's calling
Either fly high or keep falling (woo!)
Either walk tall or keep crawling (woo!)
Either go hard or keep stalling
Brawl 'till I got nothin' left, it's all me
No call the cop [?] suggest
You like yourself or like the rest
Life itself is life or death
A lifetime just to have overnight success
Until the AM speakers goin loud not done till' i see the sun peek over the clouds

[Refrain]
Wind and sea mix thoughts in my brain
Never know if love will remain
As the sea comes speaking to me
Siren voices drift out of key

Wind and sea mix thoughts in my brain
Never know if love will remain
As the sea comes speaking to me
Siren voices drift out of key
Wind and sea mix thoughts in my brain
Never know if love will remain
As the sea comes speaking to me
Siren voices drift out of key
