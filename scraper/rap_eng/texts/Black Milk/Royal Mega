They say it’s the new rapture, new … vesture
Enemies slain, history’s made, new chapter
It’s nothing new, the illest groove this dude captures
So watch his moves and every move that moves after
Prove that the fans wanted some classic shit
Album of year, I guess the title was accurate
No dispute with those breaking the most ...
Music you only hear in your dreams but don’t sleep
…another underdog that came from the asphalt
Truthful about the game … shit is trash talk
Don’t even feel threatened, don’t even rap hard
Plus I never hear nothing to ... them rap lords
It’s like the same song, plus your way’s wrong
What type of music was you motherfuckers raised on?
Heard it was the hot shit, I’m not that, you not this
Like Picassos being compared to Photoshop fix
Top this, keep putting them under pressure
Another record that still breaking them unexpected
