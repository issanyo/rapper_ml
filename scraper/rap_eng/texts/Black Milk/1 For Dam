[Verse 1: Black Milk]
(Uh, Yeah, Yeah)
Funky line ripper
Henny lime sipper
Many rhyme flipper
9 to 5 quitter
You the type, out of sight, out of mind nigga
I'm the type, dynamite, gotta dine with em
Or a 9 with him
The raps stay nasty
Your white girl tripper
White line sniffer
Every line in I give them suicide hitters
Flow turn real spitters into wrist slitters
From a city of real killers
That don't see a lot of sunshine like Bill Withers
Old people live but kids gets killed quicker
The chances of seeing age 30 got real slimmer
The block still filled with the drug dealers
Pimps hoes and wig splitters
A lot of real sinners
Oh god he go hard like O Dog
On film a real menace

[Verse 2:  Fat Ray]
(Drugs, Yeah, Yeah)
Ray got the girl scouts smoking
Right back rolling with the rap Joe Rogan
It's fat and black nigga
The Cadillac emblem
The criss cross daddy mack nickles, scrap niggas
Clap pistols and act ignant
It's your business to get riches like Guilt Simpson
The coalition
We in the kitchen with a quart of chicken
Water whippin
Your ho track sends snippets
Facts shipped in
Niggas shoot like Blake Griffin
Or 8 grippers pull strings like Jim Hendrix
Niggas went from poe pimpin'
To Olympians
And weak Timberland
To real Gremlins
And the beat goes
Like the wolf in sheep's clothes
I beat little bos
Who's east the streets hold
The beast mode
Chiefs bellisimo me bro
