[Verse 1: Paris Pershun]
Get a scoop, a double dose of it
Basking in the ambiance of robbin' another
Make one scream for the unseen, unfortunately
Hands don't raise, but I still get praise
Fly lyrics on exhibit as they rip the runway
Taking off, not at all, I don't get paid to strip
So every day I dip like it's my last
Hoping that this feeling of wrong won't last too long
Mean talk with a mean walk ought to be taught
How not to get caught in that jelly
Found in the bellies of disaster, poetic
Jumping out of every window screaming, "Message!"
Blessings in disguise, covered eyes in this masquerade
Man, I wish I woulda seen the face, as always
My mind moving too fast, but still arrive too late
Virgo with the mind of a Gemini, we straight
Two heads always better than one
That's why we come second to none, give it a run
They dreams chasing' them, but they run, niggas is dumb
Y'all continue to have fun, my message is none

[Hook]
I don't wanna be famous, I just wanna be well off
Keep my bank account bangin', take care of those I care about
Fuck a Maybach, we just keep swangin' the 'lac (Right)
These the thoughts of a black insomniac (Goddamn)

[Verse 2: Slim Gravy]
Just started writing didn't know where to begin
Jot a couple lines then start over again, then again
The line was tight, the time was right
Is, the lime of light gon' shine tonight?
Dig, we got a show, I got a flow
And a couple fans, used to wanna hustle pants, studio
Love is tough, when 'bout the peace
I use it for improvement, others use it to decease
I live for it, they die by it
No beefin', that's why I diet
No thiefin', now I buy it
Was committing more than theft, my golly
Yeah I'll prolly be better off doin' this 'stead of that
Trapped in some trap, way heavy off in the mix
Got raps on top of raps
Tryna make some sense and put Dallas on the map

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Slim Gravy]
What if I was to make it, riches now, boy I'm bankin'
Bitches all in my bidness, drowning' in money, sinkin'
I'm frowning' and wonderin', thinkin' about this life I'm living
Another day, another dolla, I live my wishes
I triumph through expeditions, I woulda never thunk it
I made it, but now like, "Fuck it," I hate it, but love attention
Outrageous, a bunch of women know me now, they owe me now
But I don't even stress it, I just take a puff and blow it out
Proportion, needs my portion, every penny, fuck a Porsche, Lamborghini
I am forced to ask this Genie, "Why me?"
I ain't ask for that, asthma attacks, I just wanna breathe
Bring ambulance, ambulance, 1, 2, 3, clear
Money's my motivation, living's my occupation
My new hobby is waiting, and I'm probably impatient
But I do it for this, cop a couple of cribs
A couple of whips

[Hook]
