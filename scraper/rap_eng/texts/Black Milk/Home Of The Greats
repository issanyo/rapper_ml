I take them back little bit bit before they forget this
I'll take any style many styles make a hit shit
Ya'll niggas forget quick mothaf*cker get with
In it for the riches in it for the distance
Old school still smooth will reminisce and
P rock on the drop snares and the kick stand
And can I kick in I see with the wrist band
Man all I'm missin, can we get rich shit
Everyday big chips, everyday Christmas
Show me where the riches show me where the bitches
Take me to the bar I'm a star where the Cris at
Being broke nigga nope I ain't gonna miss that
Biggas bout to panic damn it, television panoramic
Pour the paper out my pocket, bitches throw they panties at me
Plan to get me on they matty, leaving scratches that's a gimmie
Niggas grab they glass of henney, all the ladies grab a titty
That know that they comin tipsy, that know that they comin with me
Comin with me, in the city we can kick it in the city
Ay yo welcome to the place of the home of greats
My niggas bout to show you how we do
Take a talk with us walk with us round the way
Everybody move when I say move
Ay yo welcome to the place of the home of greats
My niggas bout to show you how we do
This goes out to you, and you, and you, and you. But maybe you, you
But me and you it's a massive difference
Look around dog ask a nigga, you ain't there yet
Middle finger last laugh a critics
That criticize cause I go better than half your lyrics
You can be the best lyrical lyricist
But without these types of tracks nigga you can cancel Christmas
Yea that kinda sounds cocky I know
But ya'll won't take me serious if I don't give a cocky approach
Ya'll Know my swag I'm just rockin it more
Ya'll niggas whack I'm the opposite though, I'm the opposition
My paper stacked to the top and it grows
Don't holla at me if your paper's barley moppin the floor
No stoppin us, see the future like a psychic with binoculars... on
And I can see I'm bout to take it all over
Ya'll niggas ain't ready ya'll niggas is slow
Only handicapped please and niggas stuck in 94
New shine man catch up with the times man
Or get your ass left behind yea
