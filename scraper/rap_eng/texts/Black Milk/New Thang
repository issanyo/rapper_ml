[intro]
Yeah run up

[Chorus]
I got a new thing and she fine as fuck (uh)
I got a new baby what (uh)
I got new thing yeah (uh)
I got a new thing (whoa)
I got a new thing and she fine as fuck (uh)
Ma baby mama she probably won't like her but ahh
I got a new baby what (come on)
I got new thing yeah (uh)

[Verse 1 : RandyNotaRapper]
Some call it blessing
Some call it luck
But when you're down dog the only way be up
Some babies never make past the first trimester
And yeah I barely made through my first semester
But yeah I did it I went to college
But that shit wasn't what it was crack up to be
It wasn't like that shit that I've seen on TV
So I figured that this shit wasn't for me
So we part ties
Like Apartheid
Now I am stacking boxes working part-time
And hard times make for hard rhymes and
At all times I'll be up on my grind with all this
Anxiety weighing heavy upon my brain
And the levy breaks New Orleans
Everyday dog be on replay, it's old game man
Same old thing no change
Call it ground hogs day baby

[Break]
Uh I got a uh c'mon
C'mon yeah c'mon
C'mon yeah c'mon
Yeah

[Chorus]
I got a new thing and she fine as fuck (uh)
Ma baby mama she probably won't like her but ahh
I got a new baby what (come on)
I got new thing yeah (uh)

C'mon yeah
Uh

[Verse 2]
I keep the grass low sharpened machete
I'll be that surgeon serving serpent who surface
Slithering lurking surgically sever them vertically
Thin as spaghetti they like confetti
I'm heavily winded and ready girl
Look what'u doing to me
With that Medusa booty
I like 'em bad and boujee
Roll up and lite a doobie
You got me hard as a rock, order Ciroc
Baby party don't stop
Until the neighbours go and calling the cops
I got a thing for fornicating inebriated
Turn up the volume drown out my sorrows and serenade it
I'm feeling zoned out and fucking faded, my shoulders weighted
These days do feel like de ja vu quiet frequently lately
Yeah and I'm in search of a unfamiliar paraphernalia
Paraphilia was of rubbing your labia
Baby the mundane is so inferior
I just wanna switch it up
Do it little different today baby

[Break]
Yeah uh
Mmm baby
C'mon girl
I just want a new thang
Ahh I just want a new thang

[Chorus]
I got a new thing and she fine as fuck (uh)
Ma baby mama she probably won't like her but ahh
I got a new baby what (come on)
I got new thing yeah (uh)

[outro]
New things, they never seem to last
Very long and then they gone
