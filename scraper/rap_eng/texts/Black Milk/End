[Intro]
Death is an enemy
It stalks your trail, it walks behind you
It's coming upon you
It is waiting for the day
It has patience
It will wait for the day that you draw your final breath
If you think that this life is all there is, you're in for big surprise
For you will come down to the end of life some quicker than others
Some only live a few years, some many
But the point is for is it is appointed to man
Wants to die and you will die ...

[Verse 1]
(Yeah)
This is what it sounds like when you know you finally did it
Above the standards & the politics
These other artist's are not even artist's
Look at what I started why I keep snapping when they're already dead
They tried to kill me off but I told them I can't die yet, man I really meant that shit
This is not the end, this is only the beginning yeah we winning D.LX in the mu-fucking building
Not to mention I've been stuck in the stu going ape shit
A product of my own environment I had to take it there
Giant I am like leviathan, they cannot compare
These niggas nowadays sound the same to me
You & I will never be the same homie
Time to step up & and really talk about what's going on
Living out my raps so I don't waste a breath, when I record setting re-cords when I'm rapping
I am from a different breed, cut from a rare cloth never slack off they know I'ma fucking kill it
How come no one wants to go against the Holy Grail
Guess it's time for me to be the only one
This is not the end, this is only the beginning yeah I'm going off until I am buried
No more fake ass stories
All in guts no glory
This is equivalent of what Hov did back in 2009 except, we applying it to rappers who content with only being satisfactory
Modern day rap clones where is the divergencey
I guess everybody wanna be king, but don't nobody wanna fucking work for it
This is not the end, this is only the beginning not to mention we had influenced the whole game
Screaming Westside bumping 1 & 2
Making shockwaves the people know I'm pulling through
Growing up but I remember those long nights
All alone staring up those brights stars
Staying true to myself that I gotta keep my head up high
I know things will be different , different
So I had to rewrite history, WondaGurl saved my fucking life nigga
Taught me stay down & the games mine, can't replace time so you gotta make the most of it
You can fool us, I'm not doing what they have done yet
Maybe that's the reason they haven't witnessed the buzz yet
Maybe that's the reason the music just sounds different
We missing out on the product that gave us the feeling
Of being something amazing that doesn't come around often I think you can call it, maybe call it hold up woah' someones calling
I'm turning down all business calls & ain't returning messages
Been dealing with some real shit, no one was really checking in I don't have time to listen to propaganda
Instead of changing the channel you sit there & do nothing
Stuck in your own mind, gotta break the matrix & when I say this
I really can't die yet I'm the oldest now flow getting real colder now
I just wanna smile till' the muthafucking sun burst
I can make it happen if I don't listen to these young niggas keep telling me to stay in my lane, stay in my lane
I'm the one who made this shit
And you can be anything that you willing to save
Crew (D.LX) too strong need about ten advances
Left me for dead dawg they thought it was over.....

[Verse 2]
And I'm not looking for anything else from you
I don't expect anything less from you
You're the best to me
Yeah your perfect in my eyes you can't do wrong
I'ma play this, this my favorite song
Running up the numbers yeah we got it like that
They gone play this shit all the time
They gone run my project from the start to the finish
That's just what I call a perfect ending
When I drop my next album they'll be finished
I'm barely getting started
Fourth project, yeah I'm earning respect
Yeah I earned my damn spot now I'm here
Earned my damn spot now I'm here .....
Earned my damn spot now I'm here .....
