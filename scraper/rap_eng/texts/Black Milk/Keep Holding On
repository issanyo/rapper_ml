[Intro]
Waddup doe
Feeling a little under the weather today
But I had some stuff to get off my chest, you know
Now what I'm about to say to y'all I might had never said to the general public
So y'all gotta hear me yo, feel me

[Verse 1]
I know I might sound like I got a cold and I'm sneezing
But I'm grown and I'm breathing, hear the tone in my speaking
Both of my parents gone for a reason
Daddy's wrong just for leaving mother widowed and I'm grieving
Now spirits above the stones and the demons
She belongs in the teaching where there's a throne in the kingdom
And deep inside my bones I'm believing that my poems that I'm reading is the songs to my freedom
But life can be known as deceiving, what I'm shown isn't pleasing
Makes me wanna throw stones at a deacon in his home when he preaching
See that's Satan making my heart cold as a breeze till it's frozen from freezing
Gotta get right, I might not make it over this evening
Cause your time period is shorter than breath going from wheezing
Heard my nigga Tone, he was bleeding through his clothes
It was leaking from some chromes that was squeezing
Than when I'm all alone I be thinking I'm against all odds
Praying to God to show me the evens
But I'm sick of being poked through the seasons
Smoking dro through the drinking with two hoes through the weekend
Bout to go till I see

[Refrain]
Life can sometimes be so hard to bare
When you feel like there's no one who cares
There are times you feel all hope is gone
Don't lose faith and just keep holding on and on and on

[Verse 2]
But sometimes I feel alone in these streets
It gets cold in these streets, my heart and soul on these streets
I lost my mom so I hold to a piece of a place
Of a time when we both intertwined
It was love for a fatherless son
Although he had love for a son visits were none to seldom
I would sit on a porch till the mail come
And when it came there never was a letter with my name
But mom's was there for me, she held it down cause she cared for me
She never left even in her last path where she slept
Next to death she was always at her best, never stressed
That's why I love her

[Refrain]

[Bridge]
You gotta keep holding on, you gotta keep, keep holding on, keep holding on
Just keep holding on, you gotta keep, keep holding on, keep holding on yo
Keep holding on, you gotta keep, keep holding on, keep holding on

[Refrain]
