[Hook]
I can paint the dawn with a sunrise
I wish I could for you
I can touch a cold day with springtime
I wish I could for you

[Verse 1]
Cold day in the summer right when you think that it's over
That's when niggas put you under yea that inner city weather
When crooks is always ready, you should walk around with toolies
Tucked inside they pellie pellies had a cousin made me look out to make sure no one is lookin
With the stash in the back, stashed the bag in the bushes didn't want me to know either
Fuck rules took jewels ran by her procedure so (spring)
He slanging out his granny house just to stay fresh, didn't wanna wear hand me downs
The cost of that drama some money flow lil gold plus a couple baby mamas

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Cold day like snow day
Brands new whips and driving slowly
Pulled over by them boys in the neighborhood they don't know me
Whips too nice it might be stolen, he gotta be rolling you gotta be kidding
Wanna search the ride nigga you gotta be sniffing
Only thing inside was the CD with the name on it
Let him slide but the next guy might just put the blame on him
Ain't nothing changed on that block we used to run up up
Some heads left and a few more houses boarded up
They needed more than luck but
They still crack a summertime smile in the city more than rough

[Hook]
