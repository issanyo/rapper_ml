As we proceed to give you what you need

Slaughterhouse up in this bitch, get your bitch, make it quick
Nickel, Quick, Joey, Crook, you know we shut everybody down
Bitch this ain't no club hit, this ain't for no bitches
This is a motherfucking stick-up, quick, everybody down

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5’9”]
I’m about to rob the hardest nigga out here
Yes I’m on my joker shit, I keep a Heath Ledger for the joke of it
I don’t plan ahead of them, I don’t gamble
I just keep a .44 clip, full of bullets that resemble poker chips
I’m so the shit, bitches jumping at my pogo stick
Slaughterhouse you know we sick, everybody down
Take your bitch, same bitch you wake up with, make her trick
'til her fucking thighs hurt, momma if your pussy wet
You shouldn’t have a dry purse, call me Ryan Rhinoplasty
I will augment your ass if you mess with God’s work
When it comes to drama, fighting second, homicides first
I don’t look for drama, drama follows me, so why search?
Everybody, everybody we gon need you quiet, shh
Slaughter got a message, everybody down
I’m a cheddar getter, you a teller, I don’t care, whatever
I’ll just scare the witnesses, I’m the illest in here
Bring a pen and pad and don’t compare the sicknesses
Where the fuck the ruler at, so we can measure sentences
I am better than I’ve ever been, never been better
I don’t follow trends, I set trends for the trendsetters, Nickle

[Hook]
Slaughterhouse up in this bitch, get your bitch, make it quick
Joey, Crook, you know we shut everybody down
Bitch this ain't no club hit, this is ain't no for bitches
This is a motherfucking stick-up, quick, everybody down

As we proceed to give you what you need
As we proceed and now the drive by

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
First I pull up on your block, let my entire torch
Spit fire, burn down your empire’s boardwalk
Bitch I am melting my rims, tires, draw off
Porsche hit the wall, then my pills high as war-off
Crawled out, grabbed the new banana clip
Lascerations on my face, travel agents shit I still plan trip
Ran up on the first nigga who had a whip
Either die a hero, or abandon ship (Get out your car nigga!)
I could kill you now fuck a witness
I’m all about my business, you all about your bitchness
And I ain't bout to slow down, you oughta ask you daughter
About fucking around with Slaughter, You bound to go down
I'mma disappear when you meet the Lord
I'mma be aboard a G4 to Singapore in me and more
Or bring a whore to be a slore
Either or we ignore casualties of war you can meet the floor now

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
I get on my ‘I don’t give a fuck’ kit, fuck the money, fuck the wealth
Fuck your label, fuck your lyrics, you sit on a fucking shelf
Lava so if ain't in the topic of the constant, the discussion fell
Tell the bitch that this dick ain't gone suck itself
Nigga, I ain't no rapper I’m a mercenary
Every verse I bury, some will blame it on the perks I carry
Been in disguise when I failed or I lost
But they won’t know I’m a god until I’m nailed on the cross
And these rappers is a mess, sad is if they best
Magnum to their chest, they could piss me, it won’t matter what they said
They just rhyme, I just climb on the ladder to success
And maybe bring me some niggas that would rather me with less
My advice for the fuck boys: make some hard improvements
Career at a standstill how you gonna start a movement
Slaughterhouse the gang take part in what we doing
Or get steamed rolled over nigga pardon the intrusion

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
Y'all just heard my man snap, this is rubber band rap
Twisted drop a can cap pop pop a Xantax tell Everybody Down
Paid for life, fucking around
Uppercut a clown, fuck being playful pay homie with a frown
I don’t think y'all understand the magnitude
Mathematical, radical equations are easy to solve for power, yaowa
I’m the square root of a truth table, in the booth able to
Raise the bar from sub-par to the 9th power
I didn't pick at food, I devour
You think you hot dog, I’m walkin' around with a sauer
Kraut and onions, buns and ketchup mustard, relish
Wow I think I'mma fart, Everybody Down!
I don’t want the crown, I rock a fitted navy brown
Well its blue but yall been colorblind since I’d came around
Nobody can see me, I’m pissed off like my pee-pee
Then bought it in Tahiti, be easy, Slaughterhouse this is it

[Hook]
