Was I too loud to hear you screaming
Was I a fool to dream it once again
Was I to calm to feel
To steal
Some ordinary whispers
Calling out your name
Did I foresee the lies I've forgotten
Did I expect scars upon your face
I couldn't tame my mind
And blame
The rhymes that fell to pieces
Broken on your trace
But maybe I was ment to hear your promise
And get through it all again
And all the lines will mend
And lead the hopeless
If the gods may know your name
Can't you believe in the voice I followed
Can't you forgive the choices I have made
And if I need you now
Somehow
It's funny I'm still fighting
Though it's far too late
But maybe I was ment to hear your promise
And get through it all again
And all the lines will mend
And lead the hopeless
If the gods may know your name
If the gods may know your name
And I tear everything apart
But there's nothing to expect
From a bleeding heart
From a bleeding heart
But maybe I was ment to hear your promise
And get through it all again
And all the lines will mend
And lead the hopeless
If the gods may know your name
And maybe I was ment to hear your promise
And get through it all again
And all the lines will mend
And lead the hopeless
If the gods may know your name
If the gods may know your name
If the gods may know your name
If the gods may know your name
If the gods may know your name
If the gods may know your name
If the gods may know your name
If the gods may know your name
If the gods may know your name
