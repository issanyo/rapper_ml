Intro [ MsCosmo on 5FM - The Stir Up ]


Verse [Jovislash]

I Started the year on a different note  Had a different approach, in this game I had to be player even a coach
Dropped a single for the year 2015 Didn't do new age kwaito, I  ain't trying to fit in
Mamcane is still a big song
Disagree, I ain't fucking with you lil stupid ass, Big Sean
Took the rap activity jam I was on fire You niggas better call DJ Sbu, 'cause you need more fire
Oskido said I got a hit right here
If u think the song is wack that's your mother  fucken  shit idea
I'ma push the song till they recorgize
If you played it before, then you know that the record is nice
Early Feb we did motherland
School tours
Went all out like we bowling on a full toss
I did the Mamcane Jive Challenge
I was on the tv & radio, haters went all silent
Converse gave me goody goodies
I'm still hoodie hoodie, fucking tight booties groupies,  ku bizzy
Did a remix with the Teddy Bears
I don't care about other rappers ngi yaz' phusha ang' theli gas
I got airplay, locally and continentally
Utlwa ntwana tsa ko kasi diri Photi wetsang
I'm not the north-god I run the real north side
Still dropping hot shit, niggas know I'm not signed
I'm from the real township nigga Gomtown
Ma uza nga simba siyak cisha one more time
I'm the beast & the best in my hood
With a fist I kill the rest yeah I would
And I did 2 hit songs for them Dejays
You can find them on I tunes & e-bays
They both went so viral in 3 days
If you don't dig it feel free and erase
I gave DJ sabby Ingudu
Le number ya hlanyisa abo Gugu nabo labo Dudu
Mina no Zai Maya sa shaya Iskhathi Namanje isa gubudisa abantu ku ma pre-party
Thabithabs wa shay' umshikashika, tede tede te te te, ba ngazo phika
Phatpro a re Wababa
Thumaka Music on the  rise lana baba ba sazo saba
U-Lin Dough waba nikeza Ikhekhe La sisMay
We've been cooking dope hits  bheka since May
Watch out for Hitman le Modiri
Re satlo ba dronka nkare ba nwele di biri
2015 was not a bad year
Cause we did a lot of good shit man hell yeah
On a sad note, I lost my mentor
I got a phone call from my boy DJ Phatpro
Telling me that my brother Flabba
Is no more
I couldn't stop crying gad damn oh no
U-Cindy wenze amawaza man yeses
Who's gonna approve  all my dope  verses
But anyway I ain't judging nobody
Life goes on so we gotta live on charlie
I gotta make Flabba proud by any means
He once told me I'm the shit in Alex
Not even L Tido can sound this outrageous
Not even Sean Pages
I got bars that can put all this rappers in steel strong cages
But any way, they don't do shit for the hood
We only see them when they shoot music videos
Moving righr along
Mixtape on Alex fm dropped the top 10 list
I was on top of the top 10 list
According to me
Alexandra top 5 rappers of all time
Is Flabba, Jovislash, Flabba Flabba & Jovislash
And that's all nigga
If you disagree go ahead then call nigga
Rise up mother fucker I'll make you fall nigga
Bow down give real props for a nigga  I'm a community builder
I'm getting shoes for school kids give a round of applause for a nigga
