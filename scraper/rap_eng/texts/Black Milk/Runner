[Intro: REMI]
And let's go
YGB, HOB
Come on and get some of this juice on ya
Raiza, Baro and Remi

[Verse 1: Raiza Biza]
My Mumma never let me say I can't
She won't let me take a loss, that's why I'm heavy on my job, uh
Ain't no telling if they gon' remember me tomorrow
So I treat this like there really ain't no destiny involved
Man, it's funny how it go, funny how it's very different
When you rhyming at the show, then you walk up out the door
And then go back to exactly what this shit was like before
And they wonder why we don't fuck with their venue anymore
This is unadulterated uncut
This that homie that you grew up with and seen him come up
This that written from the continent you know we all from, all from
And you know the metaphor is Voltron, Voltron
Hey, yeah, huh? That's what we form like
Wake up in the morn', turn the mic on and it's go time
Crushed the wrong line with my sister, that's a long night
Crushed the wrong line with my brother, then it's show time

[Chorus: REMI]
Ayy, look at my mojo (Ho!)
Shea butter cover my cocoa (Yep, you know!)
In the studio with my co-host (Ho!)
Coming to you live with what we know
So don't touch the dial
Ayy, look at my mojo (Ho!)
Shea butter cover this Old Gold (Yep, you know!)
I like to roll with my soul blow (Ho!)
Only time that I pose is for the photos
So take it and go

[Verse 2: Baro]
Wake up late, baked, fixed me bacon and some crepes
Took some dishes off the basin, what it take to make it great
High, so hide a nigga face, or provide a nigga wishes
I'm doing fine, ain't got time for your business
Word to my mum, word to my aunts and my sisters
I'm a target, folks tryna tarnish my image
I'm a artist, low as the bars you been setting
Niggas starving, think I need some carbs in my breakfast
Think I need a new guitar, that's a investment
Different scenes, I'm switching paths on my ex-best friends
I picked the pieces of my heart and my intestines
Memories are getting far, yah
Head hot under Carhartt, ten toes on the tarmac
Till the car starts, and then it's bye-bye

[Chorus: REMI]
Ayy, look at my mojo (Ho!)
Shea butter cover my cocoa (Yep, you know!)
In the studio with my co-host (Ho!)
Coming to you live with what we know
So don't touch the dial
Ayy, look at my mojo (Ho!)
Shea butter cover this Old Gold (Yep, you know!)
I like to roll with my soul blow (Ho!)
Only time that I pose is for the photos (Woo!)

[Verse 3: REMI]
When I'm gold with my pen, got my girls correct
Do it for my folks so depressed, smokin' O's to stress
Do it for the culture descent to take over like J-Hova
Not for gold on the neck, 'cause you know that we'll get it, get it
Like cold in the winter
If you do it for the winnings, oh Lord, you're a gimmick
Every lyric I deliver is a load off our titties
We've been in it independent, since '09 was finished
Why I own my own business, too grown for permission
Yeah, yeah, and how I grow is my decision
Fans can keep the gas, I'm just tryna lower my emissions
Armageddon ready as I load my provisions
Blowin' smoke from my inners
As the globe keeps spinnin' the truth
The teachers keep deceivin' the youth
The leaders keep repeating evil for loot
While we keep on seekin' and freakin' the free and the new
That's what we do

[Chorus: REMI]
Ayy, look at my mojo (Ho!)
Shea butter cover my cocoa (Yep, you know!)
In the studio with my co-host (Ho!)
Coming to you live with what we know
So don't touch the dial
Uh, look at my mojo (Ho!)
Shea butter cover this Old Gold (Yep, you know!)
I like to roll with my soul blow (Ho!)
Only time that I pose is for the photos
So take it and go
