[Verse 1: Raiza Biza]
Yeah, yeah
This feels like the genesis, this feels like the memories
This feels like the déjà vu the way that I remember this
This feels like the penalties
This feels like the way they treat you
When you thinkin' different, put that different in parentheses
This feels like it's Level 3
This here feels like Pac out the window of that truck
Screamin', "Murder to my enemies"
This feels like the equaliser
This feels like the power's in the people hands
The moment that they realise that this is black enterprisin'
The heavy liftin' in the revolution
For the very freedom that we exercisin'
It feel like it's Level 5 now
This feels like the calm before the storm
But the storm is 'bout to happen right now
The excellence doesn't stress about a pessimist
Gift-wrap your future but you don't know what your present is
History, I know is of the kings of Ethiopia
The libraries of Timbuktu, now tell me, who the fuck are you?
Tryna put some Botox lips on the ugly truth
This is the revenge of the nerds from the corrupted youth

[Break: Raiza Biza]
I say power to the people, power to the people
This is who I bleed and who I speak for

[Pre-Chorus: Sampa The Great]
And such and such is that
You wanna know the feeling? You wanna know the feeling?
And such and such is that
You wanna know the feeling? You wanna know the feeling?

[Chorus: REMI]
They're tellin' me to stick to a code
They don't even know, they don't even know
So instead I'm gonna stick to my soul
You already know, you already know
They're tellin' me to stick to a code
They don't even know, they don't even know
So instead I'm gonna stick to my soul
You already know, you already know

[Verse 2: Sampa The Great]
I say power to my people
I say free our minds and heal our people
Said we lost, we don't know how they eat though
Killin' all our voices, shit, we don't know how to speak though
Tell us that we angry, all we wanna be is equal
Tired of being angry, tired of being bitter
I'm tired of marchin' on so we can do it all next winter
I'm tired of speakin' up and bein' labelled as a villain
You say you're so with us while undermining what I'm feelin'
I'm speakin' on my feelings, I'm tired of bein' raged
I'm tired of bein' tired, I demand a sea change
I'm puttin' on the armour every time I'm in your space
And when I say I need my own
That's when you say it's 'bout race, you wanna know race?
You wanna know the feelin' when they spittin' on your children
For the colour of they face?
Talk about age, my baby brother tried as an adult
Luck for life to put a nigga in a cage
My sister got it changed, the image of what beauty is
I know her face would never ever get a second glance
Myself, it's just a fade, they tokenise and share the [?] diverse
And put my image on the cover 'cause I'm black

[Pre-Chorus: Sampa The Great]
And such and such is that
You wanna know the feeling? You wanna know the feeling?
And such and such is that
You wanna know the feeling? You wanna know the feeling?

[Chorus: REMI]
They're tellin' me to stick to a code
They don't even know, they don't even know
So instead I'm gonna stick to my soul
You already know, you already know
They're tellin' me to stick to a code
They don't even know, they don't even know
So instead I'm gonna stick to my soul
You already know, you already know

[Bridge: REMI]
We've been watching so long, waiting so long
But it still goes 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
We've been watching so long, waiting so long
But it still goes 'round and 'round and 'round
We need forward motion

[Outro: Sampa The Great & REMI]
And such and such is that, and such and such is that
And such and such is that, and such and such is that
(Forward motion)
And such and such is that
(Can you feel it? Can you handle that?)
And such and such is that, and such and such is that
And such and such is that, and such and such is that
And such and such is that
(You wanna know the feeling? Can you handle that?)
