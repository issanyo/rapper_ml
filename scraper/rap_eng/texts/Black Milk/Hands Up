[Intro - Elzhi - talking]
Alright El
Get it together nigga
Take a deep breath
Okay it's simple now
All you got to do man is just go in there
Get the money, get out, in and out
You know what I'm sayin?
You ready
Uh, let's do this

[Childrens' voices behind the Intro]
Put 'em up!
Freeze!, freeze!, freeze!, freeze!
Put 'em up!
Freeze!, freeze!, freeze!, freeze!
Hands up!
Freeze!, freeze!, freeze!, freeze!
Hands up!
Freeze!, freeze!, freeze!

[Verse 1 - Elzhi] (Store Employee)
Yo, gramps empty the drawer, (oh, please don't shoot)
(Tell me everything you want), you know I'm out for the loot
Put your hands where I can see 'em, so they look like 12 PM
On the dot, see this Glock? Don't make me give these shells freedom
I got, nothin to lose, I've been cut and abused
My slut is confused, my bro can't even strut in his shoes
I'm on the edge, so I suggest you get cooperatin
If I find out you pushed the button and the cops is waitin
I'm a put stains from your brain on all of your remains
(Don't explain, take from in and out the lanes)
(Here's my chain and what I stock in the drawer)
Get to lockin the door and hear me cockin the four, cause you not gonna score
By goin apes and bananas, now, where's the tapes and the cameras
As soon as I escape then I vanish
A clean getaway, no witnesses
And sentences, you know what type of hit this is
Put your hands up

[Hook - Childrens' voices] (Elzhi)
Hands up!
Freeze!, freeze!, freeze!, freeze!
Hands up!
Freeze!, freeze!, freeze!, freeze!
(Put 'em up!)
Freeze!, freeze!, freeze!, freeze!
Put 'em up!
Freeze!, freeze!, freeze!, freeze!

[Verse 2 - Elzhi] (Store Employee)
Hey hurry up, get to closin the store
I want the money in your pockets and everything you post in the drawer
Now where's your safe? (Umm, well ...), oh you gonna stop actin dumb pops
Oh, I think I will steal this soda and these gumdrops
See I ain't got all day, time is wastin
Crack the combination, I'm a need all accommodations
Better withdraw from the largest to the small
You tryin to stall? (I can't recall)
Shhh, I think I hear, AW FUCK! somebody saw us, try to pull this off, followed us
Now they jaw's on the ground, can't be around when the law gets
Close, do what you suppose and you can catch a dose
Anybody you consider as close, is adios
Where's your car at? (I parked it very far), that's not what I asked
You 'bout to make me shoot shots in the mask
(Alright, alright, it's in a lot that's just right outside of the back door)
Let's go there (I will, but why is this gun in my back for?)

[Hook - Childrens' voices] (Elzhi)
Hands up!
Freeze!, freeze!, freeze!, freeze!
Hands up!
Freeze!, freeze!, freeze!, freeze!
(G-g-g-g-get your motherfuckin hands up! I need to see 'em)
Freeze!, freeze!, freeze!, freeze!
Put 'em up!
Freeze!, freeze!, freeze!, freeze!

[Verse 3 - Elzhi] (Store Employee)
Now any sudden moves, you will feel the effects of the buck
Where did you park inside the lot? (it's right next to the truck)
I got to think fast and decide, you slide into the passenger side
And you better have some gas in your ride
Hurry up, hand me the keys so I can start up this piece of shit
It ain't work and I ain't waitin for the police to get
Closer, so I can be inside a Wanted poster
No sir, we hoppin out, like everything is kosher
Hold up wait, I can't believe that it just started
You taste some me be weed, what are you retarded?
I ought to (why did you hit me?), cause you a dumb ass
And here they come fast, from a far, I'm seein some flash
It's time to bail, I'm not for doin jail time
Sittin in the cell cause of a failed crime
And why the fuck you up? I know we ain't just run out of gas
Now should I run out of gas, put my gun out and blast

[Break - Elzhi] (Cop)
(Okay buddy, the gig is up, and now we got you surrounded)
(All your plans are goin down with), I ain't like the way that sounded
(Drop the gun, be smart and step away from the car)
Alright I will! (nice and slow, this ain't your day is it, huh?)
(Put your hands up)

[Hook - Childrens' voices]
Hands up!
Freeze!, freeze!, freeze!, freeze!
Hands up!
Freeze!, freeze!, freeze!, freeze!
Put 'em up!
Freeze!, freeze!, freeze!, freeze!
Put 'em up!
Freeze!, freeze!, freeze!, freeze!
Hands up!
