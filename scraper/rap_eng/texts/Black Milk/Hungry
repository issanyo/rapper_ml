[Verse 1: Big Pooh]
A lot of pressure buildin' up in my chest plate
Niggas beggin' for the album said they can't wait
You hear the rumors dawg, I like to call it "bait"
My fam on the horn askin' 'bout my mind state
The mind's great, I'm sharper than I've ever been
I'm on the beach overseas sippin' Seraphin
Ain't no need for you to question if I ever been
Only from the bottom that you learn to ass end
I transcend any clique
Rap's Agent O, I'm the last one they picked
Now who payin' for it?
I don't cry over milk spilt
Place my fitted on tilt or keep steppin' like a champ
The prize winner, the victor
Leadin' man posin' in your girl's pictures
Get yours
I'm out here doin' the same
Kept my mind on my money, I don't need the fame
Ya dig?

[Hook: Black Milk]
I can't sleep I'm on the grind, I'm hungry (x8)

[Verse 2: Black Milk]
Lights camera
I'm so nice like polite manners
Flows nice as soon as I touch the mic handle
Uh, the gun blam, it could leave a murder scene
The Son Of Sam of hip hop, I murder everything
I'm from the city where niggas is ape but ain't shit
Niggas gorilla get your for your Bathing Ape kicks
Oh, great shit
They say I'm Hollywood
I take flicks and sign autographs on babe's tits
Uh, I can't sleep I'm on the grind I'm hungry
Take a risk, put it all on the line like laundry
Uh, you can't call me and try to harm me
I'll make you a dead man walkin' like zombies
Like Mike in Thriller
My rhyme sketches like a movie scene, I fight the villain
Back on board
Your game fell off track so I put it back on course
Yeah

[Hook]
