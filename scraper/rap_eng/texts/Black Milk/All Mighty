[Verse 1]
From the beginning we started out where the [?]
It's the of the struggling artists displaying [?] war
Trying to juggle with stardom
And create something that comes straight from the heart
Is the hardest task hoping it always lasts
And remain with all the cash
But fast liquor surrounded by fast woman
Make you make fast decisions
Bad decision
Trying to capture the feeling you felt
When it was just you feeling yourself
No interviews or album reviews good or bad
Just lyrics with pen and pad and beat that played in the back
Round back when you said you had that
Sound and your instrumentals and
Still won't let you live out the shadow of your hero
But fuck it know what you're here for
To hear them with that shit that the one and only
The only one that matters potential
All higher they say I'm all wired all fire and why is
That every bar been sharper than prison barbed wire
In front of that [?] fire
Trying to keep us in the dark
But our sparks brighter than candles with [?] lighters

[Hook]
Gone so long
Still Holding On

[Verse 2]
Magazines take cover shots
Used to hear shots
Mom said take cover
Played on tapes [?] breaks
Wasn't the best way to record loops
Wished the excitement was still the same though
Thoughts of changing the game go away slow
When you realize how the game go
Open eyes no surprise had to change for the better
Took time to cook rhymes and aim for the letters
TOP when they OD on kicks and snares
Stuck with me the fans that fuck with me
Threw that middle finger up like fuck the rest
No sleep I'm up when I'm up against the world
But only up against myself
In a lane of my own no cars in it
Write bars and beats with no flaws in it
And put my ten thousand hours in it for over ten years
Went a hundred miles per minute
Through the finish line
But I'm not finished or ending while time is ticking

[Outro]
Gone so long
I'm still
