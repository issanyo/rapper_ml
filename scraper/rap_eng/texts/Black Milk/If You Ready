[Intro]
Rock star status. Yeah. Check

[Verse One] [Black Milk]
Make it hot, make it fire
Ooow
Everybody move, light your lighters
Huh, ooow
My niggas hold tools when they ridin' it
Won't be cool if you pulled up beside us
Shots go bang bang
Huh, 5 O'clock news, it's a god damn shame
That's what grandma's sayin'
She's scared for my life, I got grandma prayin' like
Every single night she's still hopin' that I'm here, I tell her
I'm still here, plus
Cool as the wind
I'mma keep abusin' dudes when you'se in the pen
Whether usin' the pen or my drum programs
On that M.P., you niggas loosin' on both ends
My life is like a movie, you should put it on film
Put that camera on him, co-starrin' with Denzel
Huuuuuu
The flow go heavy
Yeah, assort members got more niggas with short tempers
They so Joe Pesci
They wanna get at me cause the haters wanna start
So they only feel a bite cause the Pit don't bark
And if you not down with the cause
(What?)
Shit can get ugly, get bloody, get lined up in chalk
Yeah

[Hook] [Kardinal Offishall] [x2]
Boooaw! Boooaw!
All my niggys let me hear it if you ready
Boooaw! Boooaw!
Let me hear it if you standin' hard and steady
Boooaw! Boooaw!
Lick a shot if you down for the armageddy
Boooaw! Boooaw!
All my niggy's
Boooaw! Boooaw!
Poisonous deadly shit

[Verse Two] [T3]
Feela feela fo' reala I kill 'em mo' with euphemism
Shots fired, exchanged
Comin' from my mechanism
Voice gets deranged
Doctors call it autism
Yep
Fiend to give the planet the best of the bar spitters
Yes, feel it the perfect example of Detroit niggas
So weird that L.A. is givin' love in this ?
To the t-t-t-t-top
Ain't we ain't gonna ssssstop
Just give 'em this rhythm that we g-g-g-got
It's all live nigga, don't you seem them jewels drippin'?
We ain't bullshittin', represent the dirty mitten
These cotton pickin' niggas thinkin' they can get buck
You never floss with us and plus we bust 'em just because
Who is this, this such and such, who thinkin' he can knuckle up?
I smack him up and smash his whip and pull him out his Acura
Say somethin' tough, I've been waitin' to see you just to beat you up
My hand is crampin' up I got a .45 I've been dyin' to bust

[Hook] [Kardinal Offishall] [x2]
Boooaw! Boooaw!
All my niggys let me hear it if you ready
Boooaw! Boooaw!
Let me hear it if you standin' hard and steady
Boooaw! Boooaw!
Lick a shot if you down for the armageddy
Boooaw! Boooaw!
All my niggy's
Boooaw! Boooaw!
Poisonous deadly shit
