[Hook: Mélanie Rutherford]
It's so complicated
No way to fake It
Our bond is so tight
The feeling's so high
(A bond so tight, Yeah)
No need to stress it
I can't object it
You say you've come alive
I'm down for life

[Verse 1: Black Milk]
Save my life like breath and save like paramedics before the death came
Before I hop on the next plane please let me just explain how you Been the best thing to me next to
Money and chicks with good music
Without you I might lose it
Without you I might do it
And most these dudes can't do this
It's us two with the movement, Yeah

[Hook: Mélanie Rutherford]
It's so complicated
No way to fake It
Our bond is so tight
The feeling's so high
(A bond so tight, Yeah)
No need to stress it
I can't object it
You say you've come alive
I'm down for life

[Verse 2: Black Milk]
It's my food and who knew that
You would give me a gift that most dudes just don't get at
Career that most can't get at
Good head but most don't listen
I come come from the land of the Smoky Stevie, Jackson, Marvin
Spirits still Livin'
The best Hip-Hop producer, Yup, your spirits still with us
The same act that's laid back in a Maybach
I'm just a needle in a haystack
That's Tryna rhyme and shine so bright
Can't define the rhyme, the rhyme so nice
In the lime but I need more light
It's me and you our bond's so tight

[Hook: Mélanie Rutherford]
It's so complicated
No way to fake It
Our bond is so tight
The feeling's so high
(A bond so tight, Yeah)
No need to stress it
I can't object it
You say you've come alive
I'm down for life
