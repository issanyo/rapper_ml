-How come your best never good enough?
-Messes never clean themselves, if I give everybody all of me then I'm left with what?
-We already loud enough, why we gotta turn up?
-If you ain't saying nothing then you need to keep it shut;
-Society want you dumbed down boy, you better smarting up
-All you know is trap talk, that really ain't saying much;
-Their reality's so delusional, everyday further out of touch
-That's why I can't feel em', it's like the devil's in EM;
-Yea I know we all sinning, that's why I was born again
-Heart and soul cleansed, yea I'll never don them horns again;
-Heavy drinking, fornicating, smoking on a daily basis
-These Lilith's to Adam accused my cousin of being a rapist;
-Even worst a pedophile, liar liars,may they all be condemned to that lake of fire while their children smell sulfur;
-And future offspring suffer, generational curse
-Most of our kid's dreams are in a conventional hearse;
-Most of our parents are fiends to something they've seen or heard
-My life's an open book, too bad most can't read a word;
-Was accused of being an actor but I'm more Steven Spielberg
-Doesn't matter how you degrade my work, you Siskel and Eberts;
-You mad cause I don't care enough to judge or respond
-This Kre8tive Evolution is what everybody's on;
-Same worldwide frequency, unity, you and me

-Cut off from our history, only taught us about slavery, once was kings of our huts, now we all neglect babies;
-Dribble basketballs while we riddle metaphors
-Tackle and bring down our own kind to all fours;
-Hope I'm not offside by this thought provoking scribe
-Let my words be the bond to the flows that severs ties;
-Close your eyes, open your mind and see what I see
-Time to kill all these negative stereotypes like Carl Lee;
- Free all political prisoners, foreign and domestic
-These governments are more twisted than the letter S is;
-The Birth Of A Nation, white hoods in white dresses
-Redneck white faces, black necks on white nueces;
-Fear our endowment, emasculate our manhood
-Raped mother Africa then take took all her free goods;
-Then went around the world, killing little boys and girls
-Want their diamonds and their pearls, stealing everything they could;
-Want their gold and their oil, opium, they want it all
-Power drunk like King Saul, about to fall on it's own sword:
