[Intro - Skyzoo - talking]
I write a little different
I write a little different
They say I write a little different
Write a little different (let's go)

[Verse 1 - Skyzoo]
Uh, write more than they could listen to
I jump down to dig a hole that they can listen through
I'm numb now cause all along what I'm givin you
Is more than you imagined any ballpoint pen could do
All and all minimal, I ain't roll a sleeve yet
Breath of fresh air and I ain't breathe yet
Third lap around and I ain't leave yet
If I talk different or it come across different, all it is is just a reflex
Pardon that, I expect 'em to miss a part of that
Four car lane to explain where my margin at
Four parts weighed and one part raw
And even that's over the scale, take one part off
Assumin you used to it, I ain't cut it the same
I double back, recut it and then cut it again
My hands dirty off the way that I waiter, we don't cater alike
My blog anything that I write (let's go)

[Hook - Skyzoo]
They say that I write a little different
It's easier to get it if you tighten how you listen
It's easier to get it if you tighten how you listen
But hey, I understand they don't follow how I pen it
(Go)

They say that I write a little different
It's easier to get it if you tighten how you listen
It's easier to get it if you tighten how you listen
But hey, I understand they don't follow how I pen it
(Let's go)

[Verse 2 - Skyzoo]
Every hero got his theme music
I made mine to coincide with how you see music
Content mirrors whatever you be music
Still up under the honor when I conceive music
The first caller to call it and work morning to morning
From off the start of his calling and took a lead to it
And I'm only followin to follow through
So if I'm knockin from the bottom then I'm by the roof
Growth spurt probably, all they ever got from me
Is step stools that I threw down for them to follow me
Next move, I move 'round for they apologies
Opposite of hear me now, guess I'm out of reach
I be on another note, hoverin above a quote
Still only curt with the words that I ain't touch or wrote
And they still couldn't corner me yet
So I'm back on post like they bought me they check, ya heard? (let's go)

[Hook] ("go" used instead of "let's go")

[Outro - Skyzoo - talking]
Write a little different
They say that I write a little different
Write a little different
They say that I write a little different
Penmanship motherfuckers
