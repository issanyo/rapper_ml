It's a state of emergency
It's a state of emergence see

Since "Last Warning," I showed you I'm transforming
Like the grain that pass through hour glasses shaped by sandstorm wind
Put 'em in a trance with the recording
See the hands swarming
In the crowd I ran towards em
And my wing span soaring
Like I'm Flash Gordon with an aerial view
Of the mitten next to Ontario
I bury ya crew
Detroit city, shoot for three points hit me
From the top of the key like I'm on the Shock
And you shocked that it's me
While Kwame defending his texts and descending in debt
I got the opposition copping a plea
But musically we setting the standards
You cats are biting and forgetting your manners
While every sentence cinematic stretching the canvas
Paint a picture of war like Guernica
All you gotta do is let it bang turn it up!
I spit these flows
'Til I'm six below
My job's to make the "revolution irresistible"
So listen close
Dangerous to speak the truth
That complicated the matters
I guess it's just an occupational hazard
In the trenches, I'm underground like the salt mines
Throwing the wrenches
Now they defenseless
We hit the fault lines
Awakening the senses we all blind
First I gotta make it through the entrance
By the time I hit the exit
You'll all rewind

It's a state of emergency
It's a state of emergence see
Say it with urgency
