[Verse 1: Black Milk]
Tell Sonny we waiting
Outside meet us at Don's house
Around the block, meet at Deion's house
Have him back at his crib before Mom Dukes finds out
Cause lord knows nothing gets past Ms. Jones
Like before when she smelled marijuana on our clothes
Marijuana on my coat
Told me like "Son you got to go"
Told me like "Show respect when in my home"
"Know you was raised better"
Said to her "I don't mean no disrespect ever"
Not clever, but I thought I was
Not cool or slick as I thought I was
Cutting school, Sonny was with all of us
Didn't think I was a bad influence
On her son but she probably thought different
If I asked her
Only had him skip a couple times out of class
But Sonny had mom had dad huh
But I ain't see my dad much
Didn't have no real direction
I ain't see my dad much
So, when the trouble comes
I don't mind to take the blame
They already expect me to be the one to be insane
In the jail or in the grave, gone
You the only talent out our group
Only one that got potential to get on
So we make sure Sonny making songs
Standing on stage with him like
"My nigga, we on"

[Skit: Litte Kid]
You say "Yo your bother scared of my mans nigga"
He ain't scared of nobody nigga
*Talking fades*
