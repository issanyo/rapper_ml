[Intro: Black Milk]
Yeah!...Yeah!...Yeah!
I know we got you niggas thinking like
"A yo, what's going on? Sound like some end of the world shit."
It's not a fantasy. Nope, it's really going down. Let's do it

[Hook: Black Milk]
Who making hits like these?
Call up, nigga...nigga Sean P
Call up, nigga...nigga Guilty
3-1-3 to the N-Y-C
Who making hits like these?
Call up, nigga...nigga Guilty
Call up, nigga...nigga Sean P
3-1-3 to the N-Y-C

[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
Yeah, I'm chemically imbalanced, you're no challenge
I eat hot emcees like cold salads
I'm so valid, trust the word
Find me in the ghetto, puffin' herb
Murder City madman stacking bills
Walk past the snakes and dap the real
Talk to me foul, I'll clap the steel
The type of dude you'll have to kill
We keep hunting, and if I'm breathin' (What?)
We won't stop 'til the odds get even
Revenge is a dish served cold
So I wear coats and stay in murk-mode
Break bread, the flow is worth gold
The silver lining is his skin is bronze
So I ain't have much to give to moms
But a headache ...naw I'm on it, she's straight

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Yo, you can't mess with the bomb shit
Me, Guilty & Black is aggressive content
No love letter rhymes & raps about chicks
Just a whole lot of drugging and thugging, that's it
You can call me one-dimensional
But ain't too much talking when a slug get into you
And don't ask the god stupid shit in the interview
I grab Hex' sket then i'll wet up your inner tubes
Bike-rider, Lance Armstrong nigga
Running out of air fam, can't stand long nigga
Sean Price: the worst rapper, the purse snatcher
Smack shit out of you and whoever's the church pastor
My hand in the collection plate
Don't you ever disrespect the Ape
Sean P!

[Black Milk]
We just getting started. Tell 'em!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Black Milk]
BK & double three one is trouble
These one's trouble, each one'll crumble
Whole crews that front on old crews to fumble
Guilt run a play, P run a huddle
They say whatever but they like to mumble
So watch what they say. Results: Guns, the muzzle
Blood starts to bubble
Random, Random!
Had to double our pay, so cash them out
It's 'no dough, no show' don't even go ask them
So, Bro this probably be bigger than my last one
Who ahead in the race? Passed them
Hear it, now smash them
This that headbanger, no aspirin nigga

[Hook]
