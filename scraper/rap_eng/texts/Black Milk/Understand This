[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Yo, rap professor
Acknowledge the scholar shit, no scholarship
Wordplay wizardry, giving me a conglomerate
Follow this, those who don't, fuck it they face abolishment
Suckas slurp sleepers and psychologically swallow dick
Shit, ain't the same Sean from the last album
Don't smoke weed, I'll smoke your seed when I blast barrels
Clap Harold in the ride with Cain
Bitch niggas burnt, lyrically I'm supplying the flame
Deriding the game
So raw, I throw cut on it
Track ain't cracking unless Ruck on it
Like, who the fuck want it?
Cricket noise in the background
Niggas quiet, can't do a thing when I smash down
Claiming your King, word to god I will snatch crown
Put it back on my head, I'm taking it back now
Sean Price on some new and improved shit
Life is a chessgame, I'm stragically moving
Your move, bitch

[Hook: Black Milk]
Yeah, yeah, down for whatever
Rounds in the leather
If a sound, you fucking clowns ain't found nothing better
Understand this
Understand this

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
Snotbox busters, stage show rusher
Cold steel make a hardcore cat stutter
Salesman, half off tags with boxcutters
Make it where you couldn't get a hug from your mother
Carnivore stalking, feast on my rivals
Pops from my rifle will end your survival
And honestly I feel I'm not liable
Cause they should've known Guilty Simpson isn't tribal
Yeah, I used to keep grams on me
'Cause they knew I had better nicks than Mike D'Antoni
And I'm one of a kind, your side can't clone me
Rappers can't do the shit that I can, homie (homie)
Hold me down, I'm a problem, severe one
Punch-drunk rappers get socked on the beer run
Random, never been afraid to scrap (uh huh)
I'll make your whole life fade to black

[Hook: Black Milk]
Yeah, yeah, down for whatever
Rounds in the leather
If a sound, you fucking clowns ain't found nothing better
Understand this
Understand this
