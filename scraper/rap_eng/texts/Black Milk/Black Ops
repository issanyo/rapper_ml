[Hook: Fat Ray]
Get the hardware, take it to the enemy
The hard-heads all here, man the artillery
Niggas go to war for their liberty
Black ops, arms and abilities

[Verse 1: Guilty Simpson]
I'll turn your favorite artist to a mural
Put papes on it, with his birthday
A dash, and today's date on it
I didn't know I was confusing you, shit
We gotta eat, even murder these a musical this, this
This isn't for the weak hearted
You're who the streets target
With the tattle team, so we hurt one
Put them in the hospital, get them all together
And then the whole waiting room is getting magazines
Splatter dreams
Attitude is like gimme money and a bag of green
I'm blowing smoke signals at an Indian broad
I told her I'm unemployed please give me a job
This grade A potent and grade A smoke
I'm loving it
R.A. wrote the grade A dope for hustling
And where we from and where P from
It's guaranteed cats in the hood is gon' fuck with it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Question, why you hem your jeans
Y'all niggas looking like Ben Vereen
Don't get rocked, pa, Benjamin Grimm
With a nine double m on the scene
Fuck around and make your Timberlands swim
Drown nigga
Fucking clown nigga
313 and Buck is the town, nigga
I'm Sean, King of the Apes
You prawn, king of the shrimps
Funny style, limp wristed son of a bitch
This nigga put fingers on this trigger
One or two pulls, this nigga is disfigured
I'm a good father but I really be illing
Colt .45 on my side, no Billy Dee Williams
Around blocks niggas like where the work at, behind you
Right on the corner in the jaw of a minor
Your whole crew is pussy and very vagina
Promise to bust your snotbox whenever I find you, P

[Hook]
