Wake up in the mornin' like...welcome

[Hook]:
Niggas that feel me, feel me though
It's the real my nigga, really though
Nigga in the field, my nigga, here we go
If you ain't ready for it, what you in it fo'?
Errol Flynn world wind, we reppin' the Mo'
In the back gotta keep it on the low
We bringin' it if you niggas keep bringin' the doe
Gotta go my nigga, we gotta go
Gotta go my nigga, we gotta go
Gotta go, nigga, we gotta go
Gotta go, nigga, we gotta go
Gotta go, nigga, we gotta go
Gotta go

[Verse One]:
Tell 'em all settle down
We bringin' the real, wack niggas not allowed
So Detroit like on Belle Isle
So Detroit like 7 Mile
So what up doe?
Then we tryin' to get it then get out
Gettin' much doe
Then bringin' to the hood proud like "What up yo?"
You ain't never seen shit
London boutique fit
You ain't never seen this
What you mean, I call my regime, yeah my team is
At wherever the cream's at, yeah I mean this
Shots rang to the chest, ain't breathin'
Breath just left the soul, while it's slowly leavin'
Can't leave him, out yeah I'm still here
Feelin' better than ever
While they still cheer
Why I'm still here
Welcome to a new zone
New king, now home
Welcome to a new throne

[Hook]:
Niggas that feel me, feel me though
It's the real my nigga, really though
Nigga in the field, my nigga, here we go
If you ain't ready for it, what you in it fo'?
Errol Flynn world wind, we reppin' the Mo'
In the back gotta keep it on the low
We bringin' it if you niggas keep bringin' the doe
Gotta go my nigga, we gotta go
Gotta go my nigga, we gotta go
Gotta go, nigga, we gotta go
Gotta go, nigga, we gotta go
Gotta go, nigga, we gotta go
Gotta go

[Verse Two]:
Yeah, it's the actions
Anger of a mad man
This what happens
Tears fall fast when you can't catch the laughter
Out this rap madness
Try to catch a break but it ain't comin' fast e-nough
Just the laughter
Happiness smiles when you show you better than niggas and people see how
And they recognize now
Yeah, you ain't nothin' to fuck with
With no co-sign, with no nothin'
Started from the ground up
And now up they around industry niggas that I don't like to fuck with
But I play the game, handshakes give me dap
Yeah, what up doe
I'm feelin' like fuck those lames
But, it's just business
I feel good now
I'm at a point in my life, I wish a nigga would now
So much support I'll bring the whole hood out
Makin' undeniable music nigga that's no doubt

[Hook]:
Niggas that feel me, feel me though
It's the real my nigga, really though

If you ain't ready for it, what you in it fo'?
Errol Flynn world wind, we reppin' the Mo'
In the back gotta keep it on the low
We bringin' it if you niggas keep bringin' the doe
Gotta go my nigga, we gotta go
Gotta go my nigga, we gotta go
Gotta go, nigga, we gotta go
Gotta go, nigga, we gotta go
Gotta go, nigga, we gotta go
Gotta go
