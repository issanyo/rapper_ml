[Intro: Guilty Simpson & Black Milk]
Whoa
New shit
Yo
Yeah
Go
This the one that gone get live on the club man
Matter of fact, DJ turn it louder
Uh, uh
Turn it louder

[Verse 1: Black Milk]
From the floor to the ceiling
Detroit in the muthafuckin building
Destroy everything yo we killin
D-Boy on them big boy wheels yep
Too cold to grab
Even more like a photo lab
I'm a shoot something
Niggas fold when the gun go blast
Half ass rappers we just fold in half
Throw in trash
Might go pop like the go-go dancing
Go pose for the photo lens
And I still got more but
If you wanna go flow for flow or toe to toe we can go but
New year so I'm stoppin' lames
Can't give them fame so I'm not droppin' names
Labels played the fools like they played to lose
I just played you dudes
Checkmate your move
I'm a just give them two plus two bars
Niggas like ease off em Black
Please just cool off
Real music I crush gimmicks
Give it up, naw
More like Willie Hunts with it

[Refrain: Black Milk]
Hands to the sky
Get them high
Call up for help
This shit is fire
Sound sound alarm
Sound the alarm
Sound sound alarm
Sound the alarm

Hands to the sky
Get them high
Call up for help
This shit is fire
Sound sound alarm
Sound the alarm
Sound sound alarm
Sound the alarm

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
Yeah
Too live for TV
(Get em' Guilt) Too real for radio
They hate the joint
But they'll play it though
(Why?) The fans demand the man and I'm him
Chipped up watch and fresh Timbs
Throw em up high
Gun for the spy
Tryin 'to catch wind like the spread wings on a fly
Nigga I, solemnly swear to rep thorough men
Got em' hooked like black tar heroin
Barrels in your mouth
We own the house
Here to take my cut since your holdin' out
I'm a brand new face wit a old school weapon
Hammer mothafucka', yeah 3-5-7
I gotta feed my brethren
No excuses so withholding doe is useless
Be warned if you pay me light
You betta' have something of value to make it right

[Refrain: Black Milk]
Hands to the sky
Get them high
Call up for help
This shit is fire
Sound sound alarm
Sound the alarm
Sound sound alarm
Sound the alarm

Hands to the sky
Get them high
Call up for help
This shit is fire
Sound sound alarm
Sound the alarm
Sound sound alarm
Sound the alarm
