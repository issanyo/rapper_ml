[Intro]
Is a music that is all beat
Strong beat and talk
And it sounds like this

[Hook]
Shake em off, shake em off
Play it off
Put yo life on the line
Real walk, real talk put yo life in the rhyme


[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah mean with the ax
From a scene where they put beams on your back
You either sell packs or you either sell raps
Sixteen years old spittin' sixteens in the trap
And OG's talk real
Come make half a mill wait for that rap deal
Can't wait that long nigga
Ride with it
Make their bed they gotta lie in it
Put a lot in the plot puttin' time in it
Who's that peepin in my window
Got me peekin out my window every five minutes
Trynna make six figures started off as five digits
Ain't playin' no more
What you sayin'? What you playin' it for?
Where you trynna hang out yo we hang at the store
Niggas playin' the law till they lay in the morgue
It's that dirt rap
Ghetto DMF where they ask where the work at
Eastside strip clup ghetto bitches twerk at
Don't sleep you might catch a dirt nap

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Off the books and shit
On record, off record off the hook and shit
Took this shit
I still rep it ain't nothin'
Inner city still betray Dave Ruffin
Rugged and uh, say somethin' we stay dumpin'
Any place they hear the bass we keep the place jumpin'
Yeah the city where they got the hot gun ray
Say fuck laws, 911 calls but the cops come late
But now we recording while fans waitin'
Came from bus stations recording in mom's basement
Didn't have a dime and couldn't go buy a Nathan
Now I only spend my time with dime faces


[Hook]
