[Intro] [Bishop talking]
Jeah! It's your boy! Bishop motherfuckin' Lamont. Uh, courtesy of Aftermath
Uh, and that knockin' ass lovely track you hearin'?
That's my nigga Black Milk. Transmittin' live from the D. Haha

[Verse One] [Bishop Lamont]
I got that vision like C-Span
So fly the rap flow pterodactyl, check the wing span
I'm so big I can reach around the Earth and shake my own hand
We global, you local, the game's in a choke hold
In actuality police brutality is the best way to describe the flow
It's Cali and The D we should have did this a long time ago

[Black Milk]
Counterflow, rhyme fall in place like Dominoes
Nigga end your life, jump the bridge, Geronimo
Or hang yourself and tie the rope
The game is over dog and the squad say you got to go
Yeah we count the doe and we got the finer hoes with us
And tires with the rimes in 'em
Touch down in the west coast
And tell my nigga to hit me up when he touch down in the mid

[Hook] [Black Milk]
Yeah live and direct
Ridin' with the best
We sh-shut it down, niggas live on the set
Make no mistake...

[Bishop talking]
...I ain't diss you on no record nigga
I wasn't even thinkin' about you. But now I am

[Verse Two] [Bishop Lamont]
Try to diss me on my own track
But make the beat sound wack
Please next time you wanna diss me, let me write your diss rap
You still runnin' over at Fox Hills Mall?
Mad cause daddy didn't buy you a Barbie Doll
Seek some therapy you rape victim, get some closure
Bitch, learn to love again, our relationship's over
Two tears in a bucket, fuck it
I wasn't gonna hit you
I never beat my kids in public
(Daddy no!)
Hehe, you fuckin' buffoon
I ain't got no time to babysit, now go watch cartoons
(Go to your room!)

[Black Milk]
Too soon and I still bang harder
So far ahead of y'all got y'all scared to brawl
I'm Mike Tyson of ring
Niggas scared to spar
Teams not scared at all
Huh, walk through the game and bogard like forearms on Incredible Hulk
It's nothin'
You niggas spit hard but I'm a little sicker so I cough it up
Niggas chalk it up as a loss

[Hook] [Black Milk]
Yeah live and direct
Ridin' with the best
We sh-shut it down, niggas live with the set
Make no mistake
Yeah
It's so great
Yeah
When the bass hit, niggas go ape

[Verse Three] [Bishop Lamont]
Yeah, head to head like Siamese twins
We the new Bill & Ted in the booth again
When I extend the pen and explain what's within
Real niggas start illin', fake niggas start squealin'
The rap game is sick and this here's the penicillin

[Black Milk]
No mistake like I shared the livest
Y'all might as well 9 to 5 it
We ride the fliest whips
Flier than your highest pilot
Chipped up, it's a name brand
Tie a nigga up, spit hot dismans or fire with it
Easy
Why you wreck your brain tryin' to spit it?
The one that came with other shit
My moms and pops be the one to blame
Get at me nigga

It's your man's Black and Bishop let's go

[Hook] [Black Milk]
Yeah live and direct
Ridin' with the best
We sh-shut it down, niggas live with the set
Make no mistake
Yeah
It's so great
Yeah
When the bass hit, niggas go ape
