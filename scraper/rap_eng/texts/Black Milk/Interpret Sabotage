[Verse: 1 - Black Milk]
Yeah
And the story goes
Never how the story's told
Young niggas with a goal
Tryna' find a path down that glory road
Suffer from a sabotage
Choose where you rather fall
Red pill, blue pill
Digital and analogue
Gotta ahead and both inside my catalogue
And represent ones that never had it all
From the most high, to the most low
From being poor to going out to ball
From money and all, to poppin' champagne
With bitches and balls
They get in the car, they get out the car
They get in the loft, then get out they broad
And wake up the next morning like:
(inhales, and exhales)
Felt like it was all a dream
Turning to a victim of this fantasy
So everything ain't always what it seems
Getting drunk of the life the industry brings
And not trying to sober up
Niggas getting drunk of the thought of blowin' up
What the fuck?
Never had it growin' up when I was old enough to get it on
Bruh, trying to bring a feeling that and
Trying to bring a feeling back and feeling the nostalgia
You stuck in the times
We're caught in the future
And you thought you knew what it would all come down to
'Till you look up and you look at this world that surrounds you
That surrounds you

[Hook: Mel]
I know
That I been
On this road forever
And I
Still know
That things are gone get better
Take it all on
(Take it on, take it on)
Takin' our hope
(Take it on, take it on)
Take it all (on)

[Verse 2: Black Milk]
And the story shows
What we in it for
Tryna' make some history before the casket close
'Fore them credits roll
The pressures of havin' love
For the same, game
Pressures of getting older
Tryna main-tain
In the rap-shit
And I complain
Like most of these cats that
Came in, love with a certain era of music
And never though it would have came
With a curse, Never though it would have
Changed for the worse
But you see it's all objective
So now I walk into the next area with a hunger
Bigger than the one I left with
Makin' sure I'm givin' y'all the next shit

[Hook: Mel]
I know
That I been
On this road forever
And I
Still know
That things are gone get better
Take it all on
(Take it on, take it on)
Takin' our hope
(Take it on, take it on)
Take it all (on)
