[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayo, what's this? Feel good
Yeah, yeah, like how that feel right there
I gotta let some shit off my chest
Ready? Aight

[Verse 1]
Live, in my own flesh
In my own breath, on my home steps
In the Mo' where my home rests
And I hope what I hold gets
In the car for the doe for a pimp and a pimp's job is to get mo' doe
Like the 17 year old's on the steps in the ghetto
Where they won't let you get bored and the moral of the story is death
And the moral of the story got everybody worried and stressed
To the point where my niggas wear vests
Up under they white T with a strap
Up under the car seat with a Tec
So I made this for my niggas that made it onto the next
Level, level, level
Celebrating in the club with the Moet
Bottles to the good life, no more hood life
So if you cashed out, mash out let me see you just...
(Bounce)

[Hook]:
To the top of the world we goin' and we goin' in
Hoods to the borough, we here, let me see you just
(Bounce)
In the mornin', in the evenin'
Do it for the fam that be in the streets and
Let me see you just
(Bounce)

[Verse 2]
And the hits ain't change
Best artist not on your radio play
Still gettin' blazed, gettin' head from a centerfold
While Radiohead is played on my radio
And it's so sad
Artist's soft as a pillow, front tough as a Brillo pad
I got fans that feel the same way
Like 'Ditto Black
Gave up, can't depend on rap."
But it ain't just us where the pain struck
Even old school artist's feel like the game's fucked
That's when I clock in as an option when
You need a breath of fresh oxygen
And whoa
I feel it ain't no balance
Class of my own so I feel that there ain't no challenge
When I see that there ain't no talent in most niggas
Not tryin' to boast, just showin' you how most niggas feel
Rap deals, stack mills
Tell me where the rap game went over the past year
Underground fans said "nowhere"
Ask record execs they're tryin' to find what's next to blow
Oh
Got doe from the fans
It's just business, yeah I understand
Tryin' to find a new dance like the Running Man
But when it's all out
I'd rather see 'em all
(Bounce)

[Hook]:
To the top of the world we goin' and we goin' in
Hoods to the borough, we here, let me see you just
(Bounce)
In the mornin', in the evenin'
Do it for the fam that be in the streets and
Let me see you just
(Bounce)
