[Verse 1]
All I hear is silly nonsense, blahzay-blah
Niggas say they the king, why'd they lie?
Give 'em three the hard way, like menage a trois
You wanna get at ya boy? I say try
On the blocks I ride slow and on the high way, fly
Keep the flow top secret, cause guys may spy
Don't this feel good like chilling on a Friday high?
Whether the A, LA, NY, Detroit
If you mad nigga, que ce sera, sera
Just don't ask for my opinions, my reply stay dry
Everybody's got there ears out when I play my
New shit, I'm through with, I'm on some other shit
Fresh off the block where they fire ye' by
Where my brother would play with our lies
Now it's hello blue, and bye grey sky
We on some jiggy shit, na-nah, na-nah, neh-nah

[Verse 2]
You say you on my level? Well, tell me how so
You haven't the slightest how deep the style go
While you mean muggin me with your eyebrow low
And your lip curled, you really need to smile yo
Is it cause, if you know I get my chance I'll blow
Get dough, flip it, then pile mo'
To my step dad, here's a hundred thou I owe
Cause my real dad never saw his child grow
Used to be off them reg's, but it's now 'dro
Come see me perform and watch a crowd show
Present from top to bottom, in every aisle, row
Oh, you don't know my style? Well, your babydoll know
Shh, keep the down-low, I know it's foul bro
That's what you get for hating on a versatile flow
Let me put you up on something I learned a while ago
You give a nigga a inch, he take a mile, oh!

[Verse 3]
You ain't know that I was this tight tell me what the dealings
You think I'm talking to you, so you catch nothing but feelings
I ain't signing to a major 'less they trynna cut the millions
My nigga Kat told me, "El, hold ya nuts and kill 'em"
For sure, dude, I'mma give them nuts a drilling
Have 'em bow, nah, fuck that, if they front their melon
You heard me right, did I s-s-stutter? Still I'm
Giving you food for thought, this is bread and butter skill and
Life looks a little different when she ride around, it's thrilling
I play my cards right, no matter how they cut or dealing
A wise man said, listen to your gut, it's illing
So I don't fuck with niggas sitting on their butt and chilling
That's double for these broads dog, damn these sluts is illing
All I wanted was a nut, what? I'm just being real
And I came a long way from being in the gutter, stealing
Now I'm as dope as the shit that your blunt concealing
