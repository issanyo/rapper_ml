[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
I'm on the grind, f'real, that's the way I live
Ohhh, I gotta make it, something's gotta give
I'm on the grind, f'real, that's the way I live
Ohhh-whoooa, I gotta make it, something's gotta give

[Buckshot - Verse 1ne]
I wake up in the morning and I plan my day
The +Blueprint+ to the Movement, you stand in my way
Got heavy artillery, my hands and my K
Prepare to spray, then I look in the mirror and pray
Like, "PLEASE, God Almighty, please politely remove me
From the blind, deaf and the dumb" but life is a doozy!
Life is a movie, and you can call this a drama
Every scene show the team gettin caught up in a problem
Solve it, with a revolver, not too wise but
You can't tell a nigga nothin when you don't know pride
Everyday fly, everyday high, medicate why?
Shit, I feel fine and I'm dead in my prime
+Bread+ on my mind, that's the only reason I +Wonder+
Would a slice make me feel nice and feed all my hunger?
At least if I'm under, I can hit the top
Cause at the top, when you hit bottom, shit just stop
But I...

[KRS-One - Verse 2wo]
Keep it movin, keep it movin, get yo' hustle on
Whatever you're doin, pursue it from dusk 'til dawn
No handouts, we plan ROUTES
Anywhere we go, we stand out!
Huh, I'm like a hip-hop junkie
I'mma stay hungry, we abouts to get MONEY!
Man it's funny, cats get money and turn to Silly Putty
Soft and lovely, that ain't for me!
You can listen to my tummy
It's constantly growlin and howlin, you got somethin for me?!
Uh, you can't ignore me, I got somethin on me
I be hustlin, how you think I got to 40?!
Huh, keep hustlin', even when it hurts
Cause when you lose your job, you find your work
It's in you, it's called "Survival Skills"
That entrepreneurial spirit, we gots to build UP!!!

[Mary J. Blige]
I'm on the grind, on the grind, on the grind
Everyday, all the time, all the time
You can't hold me down, can't take my crown
No way, no, no waaay (never ever, never ever)
I'm on the grind, on the grind, on the grind
Everyday, all the time, all the time
You can't hold me down, can't take me down
I'm in this thing to stay-AAAAAA-AAAAY

[Hook]

[Mary J. Blige - Outro]
Keep it movin, keep it movin, get yo' hustle on
Lord help me...
Mmmmm, I'm on the grind, yeah yeah yeah
MMM, I'm on the grind, everyday all the time
Can't hold me, ohhh-whoooa-oh
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give
I'm on my grind all the time
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give
That's the way, that's the way I live
That's the way, that's the way I live
