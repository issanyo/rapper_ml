[Verse 1: Buckshot]
In my neighborhood there's a bullet
For every black man with a trigger if he pull it but
Could he take another option instead of stopping yep -
Next time keep it moving up the block on Duckdown
On the penal code the C in fold
Why smart motherfuckers take the scenic road
Better known as the other route
Hate the way the cops is hopping out on my niggas
It's like a scene from slaughterhouse
Word of mouth does more damage than gunpowder
Niggas' feelings get hurt? Now its a problem
I got them on the phone talking to backbar
Lord saying what's going on in my backyard
Facts are every black man ain't a rap star
Track star, trap star know we get that far

[Hook: Buckshot]
What you gonna do?
Keep on running, thieves keep coming out of the blue
When it comes to this, they going to get one shot, one hit
What you gonna do?

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
I don't care if you bump this while your fucking your whip
Or if you stuck to the script like plantain chips
Just remember soldier that when the government flips
It's going down harder than the last bullet in the Glock clip
Visions of the future toxic in my cranium
Like the byproducts of enriching uranium
Gentrification byproduct like the palladium
So this is the message that I relate to them
Before they do me like Amadou, I'ma do what I gotta do
You should follow through before they bottle you out of the blue
They treat niggas and spicks like tigers and lions
Cute little babies but when they grow put them behind iron
Let them join the military, fight for the country hard
Throw them some college money, get them a green card
Get a black Pinocchio President to lead
But controlled by an old white Gepetto on Wall Street
Guerrilla war through the jungles of concrete
Microphone like the Kalakov in my arms reach
Fuck the commercial world I'd rather spit raw
We carry the underground like a rickshaw
Hard work like raising children on food stamps
Trained to fuck you up like a terrorist bootcamp
I'm here to celebrate the rebirth of an age
And start to BDP motherfuckers right off stage

[Hook: Buckshot]
What you gonna do?
Keep on running, thieves keep coming out of the blue
When it comes to this, they going to get one shot, one hit
What you gonna do?

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
KRS Buckshot Brooklyn lovedot
Brap to the realness we dusting them bloodclots
Bronx man come true like pop pop
.22, .45, Glock, man we stock that
Before I put your mop back I'm pushing a cop back
Cause they violent and I'm trying to stop that
People act like it's insanity to fight back
Yeah I know Mr. Sean Hannity won't like that
But they ain't goin to like this either
They hate it when slaves become writers and readers
And Hold Heaters and don't need they femurs
We culture keepers Hip Hop's true leaders
I'm chilling in New Orleans under the I-10
With the last victims of Katrina
You gotta see the corruption
Families dying and we still on the TV buggin?
Rise up niggas get your guns up niggas
Feed your families get your funds up niggas
Rise up niggas get your guns up niggas
Feed your families get your sons, listen
It's an honor to be rockin with Duckdown
As you can see its a good thing you stuck round
Fuck clowns we the original Bucktown
We generals with connections to uptown
We gotta tell the crowd calm down
'Cause we rock in cities and farm towns
I'm on now, you know true revolutionaries are beyond guns
We throwing bombs now
