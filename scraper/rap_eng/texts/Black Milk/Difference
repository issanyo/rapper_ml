In the abbey of disguise, try to look into your eyes
But you turn away from me 'cause I'm so ordinary
Who am I to miss the point of my self-deceptioned lies
Self despair, how can I dare to dream on ?

If it's true that it makes no difference, under any circumstance
I'm wrong 'cause I'm still tryin' to interfere with what I've got
Does it makes no difference ? far beyond my common sense
How come that I'm so determined if it makes no
Difference

See my microcosm turn, against me once again
Smash the frame, can't stay the same in this confrontational ride
Who am I to miss the point of my self-deceptioned lies
Self despair, how can I dare to dream on ?

If it's true that it makes no difference, under any circumstance
I'm wrong 'cause I'm still tryin' to interfere with what I've got
Does it makes no difference ? far beyond my common sense
How come that I'm so determined if it makes no
Difference

If only I knew what is comin' my way
I could consider a change right away

If it's true that it's no difference, under any circumstance
And when I'm wrong, I'm wrong
If it's true that it makes no difference far beyond my common sense
When I'm wrong, I'm wrong

If it's true that it makes no difference, under any circumstance
I'm wrong 'cause I'm still tryin' to interfere with what I've got
Does it makes no difference ? far beyond my common sense
How come that I'm so determined if it makes no
So determined if it makes no
So determined if it makes no
Difference
