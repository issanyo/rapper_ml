[Guilty Simpson]
I remember when it all started
A young cat, tryna get her trust back
Cause me and my momma, we hit a rough patch
Searching my room like "Where the drugs at?"
She didn't find em'
But found a heater in my coat lining
This is way before rhyming
When I had a dead fear for all the old timers
Earning stripes on the streets without a co-signer
She askin' "Why?"
I couldn't say
It seems I was breaking her heart every other day
I needed another way
Witnessing my peers bubble y√© making double pay
Tucking the clock cleaner for block schemers
Because if you're rocking high sneakers, they might rob ya
Every day inner city problems
I used to wish my parents chose a condom
Life was a gift I never asked for
Me and reality had a crash course
We used to jump and slap the backboard
Before the studio life and rap tours
I counted scars way before I counted bars
Grew up quick, dealing with a screwed up chick
Who, what, when, why, where and how?
Hittin' licks like crime pays for now
Skinny bird chest youngin and living foul
Winging it on talent, still fly
Sore attitude I jumped and got high
Enjoying the view knowing something is important to do
But all I was was a fan then
I didn't have that understanding
I wasn't a man then; not even close
Then I recited a rhyme I wrote
Grim life found hope
Stupid me noticed opportunity to keep me far from broke
So I tried rhyming in my homeboys ride
Pontiac 6000 rolling up freestyling
Years later, admiring the dough we piling
What a come up
Getting my ones up
I used to hit the studio with a gun tucked
You never know when life imitates art
I'm better than a role-player when the game starts
I'm a team captain
Making dreams happen
Jotting words at lunch, go home and read napkins
Now what I wrote feeds me
