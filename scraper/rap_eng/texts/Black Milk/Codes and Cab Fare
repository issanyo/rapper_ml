[Verse 1: Black Milk]
King without a care, frownin' while the crown lay on they head
Crew recruitin' Huey Newton, chair sittin' hand holding spear
You was on a star chase, I was in a dark place
Lookin' for that glair
Lookin' for that light ahead
Days got dimmer starin' down that dark tunnel
Hopin' that you see a glimmer when them walls start crumblin'
Calls stop comin' in
People start mumblin'
Stomach start rumblin'
Need to hear applause and the fans call once again
Cab driver make a right, right up at the light
Destination: life
But stay here for a moment
I shouldn't be that long just keep the meter goin'
Keep the meter rollin' while I go in for a few
Left a song for the little one, tell him Dad cares
Wish I could've stayed longer, gotta pay this cab fare
But um, you hopin' better days'll come
Face to face with reality, no VH1
I sit back some, Watchin' my niggas that spark live
That's waitin' for sunraise to penetrate dark clouds

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
So I'm standin between vanity and foolish pride
On 7 Mile and Telegraph where the two collide
If I'm a man amongst kings and gods, who am I
For leavin' so many crucified or coup d'etated
I'm from the D where everything is very do or die
My will to survive is what's separating you and I
My memoirs is revolutionary suicide
Now, who the realist nigga alive? Well you decide
This rusty .45 is never under-utilized
What goes down like a logo on a Puma Clyde? Homicide
Probably on these loudmouth bumbaclots
Thinking it's cool to walk around not supervised
But fuck supervision, cuz you and you can get it
Lately I've been having premonitions of superstition
But if I stepped into the confessional, who would listen?
I need to change my ways, show me the new religion
