[Verse 1: Black Milk]
Hold up
How you go from bein' on to havin' no riches?
Hoes all in your phone to havin' no bitches
Used to be highroller, now look how you sittin'
Thinkin' that your life is over, out here tryin' to make a living
Told my conscience "Shut the fuck up!", tryin' to get it together
Put my hands on my face, can't look myself in the mirror
I swore to God, I said I'd never go back bein' broke
Feelin' like I'm back at square one, fuck a nigga bein' po'
Guess he didn't answer your prayers or help your affairs
Now that no one cares, what's the point of bein' here?
Yeah yeah,  you had it all, hit a broad all night
Now shit is comin' full circle, didn't play your cards right

[Hook: Black Milk]
Trip
A'yo, a'yo, hey, uh, right there
Lay low, a'yo, uh, right there
There they go
A'yo, lay low, right there
A'yo, hey, a'yo, right there
Lay low, a'yo, hey, right there
Right right

[Verse 2: Black Milk]
Now you askin' "Was it worth it?", since your fame did surface
Now you see your purpose, didn't turn out picture-perfect
Thousand-dollar purchase, guap all in your pockets
Used to be on top but now they sayin' you ain't got it
So a'ight then, watch me get it even if they goin' to knock it
Dollar out of fifteen cents, I turn my shit into a profit
Put myself in a hole, money, it got me stressin'
Frontin' to force a smile while tryin' to battle depression
Nigga, you lost your grip up, nigga, you 'bout to slip up
Grab that bottle of liquor, pour cup, pour cup, then sip up
Hopin' the story ends, hope a new one begins
Leavin' from where I been, wake up out the sleep I'm in
Huh

[Hook]

[Outro: Black Milk]
For my niggas, and my bitches
On they hustle, tryin' to get it
When you think you know big dough, then what is it for?
Yeah they talkin' mash, woah, what I'm in it for?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They on that, we on that
Right now
