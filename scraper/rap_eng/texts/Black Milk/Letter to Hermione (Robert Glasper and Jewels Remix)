[Intro: Bilal]
What can we do? Do-do
What can we do? Do-do

[Hook: Bilal]
I'm not sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you
I'm not sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you
Do-do

[Verse: Black Milk]
On a whim, goin out on a limb
Thinkin 'bout what me and you had coulda been
Lights, nights, left ya heartbroken
And it wasn't something I couldn't even mend..
Can't even pretend, that I don't feel some kind of way
Now that you're with him, damn
Now I lost a friend, and I had no interest in these other
Wo-men that's, on the other end
Talkin on they cell, askin me to meet up but I tell
Them I'm in that studio by 8 so
No going on dates, I'd rather chill
Lookin at your number, I should call you
Yeah I will... No, I won't (Damn)
Too much pride, so I don't
Not tryna look desperate, look at who I'm left with
I'm losing myself quick! Grab a hold
Clearly you wanna talk, I see you grabbed that phone when it rang
Used to do our thing when it rain
Or will I ever see your face a-gain?
(What can we do? Do-do)

[Hook]

[Outro: Bilal]
What can we do? Do-do
What can we do? Do-do
I'm not sure
What can we do?
