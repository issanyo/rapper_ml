[Intro: Colin Munroe]
Don't bet on me I'm a long shot
I'm a long shot

[Verse One: Colin Munroe]
Maybe it's the fault of way I
Was raised on my bed in my room til
I reached ninth grade all by myself
With days to dream away, yeah

It was there that I met keys and a drum set
In the basement, played them hard til I swear
And due to this day

When I was ten they said, "Son go and take piano lessons."
When I was twelve, "I said I'd take them no more."
They said, "Son you fail at life if you fail piano lessons."
I said, "So be it." and walked out the door

[Hook:]
So don't bet on me I'm a long shot
I might be a million to one
So don't bet on me I'm a long shot
But in a million I might be the one
The one

[Verse Two: Colin Munroe]
I guess it was then that I said they were wrong
I don't need these skills to help me write a song
I'm fine on my own
So just stand by, watch me fail or watch me fly
Either way I'm gone
Some day you'll sing along

When I was ten they said, "Son go and take piano lessons."
When I was twelve, "I said I'd take them no more."
They said, "Son you fail at life if you fail piano lessons."
I said, "So be it and walked out the door."

[Verse Three: Joell Ortiz]
Yup, and that's exactly what she was
Stroked the keys ever so gently with her fingers what she does
Finesse is the perfect word to describe her manafescense
She was well after perfection at every piano lesson
And C's sounded like B's, B's sounded like A's
Carpal Tunnel told her to leave, but she wanted to stay
Her friends said that was weak but she wanted to play
This is what she wants to be, so every other day
Turned into every night so those mistakes I once heard
Sort faded away like those corny friends of hers
I know cause I watched from outside the window
As she sat in front of that grand piano
Her teacher stood up and then he clapped
So proud of his pupil that wouldn't give into the haters
And now shawty's playlist consists of Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart, Beethoven - yeah my baby havin fun
But of course I had to scoop her out
Out of a million she's the one

[Hook]

Don't bet on me, I'm a long shot
