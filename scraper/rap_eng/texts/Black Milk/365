[Black Milk]

Yes lost in the stress, fought and was taught by the best
Now that you know, so not one too test,, i am not like the rest
Never had an out-of-breath flow, next flow fly to the next show
And your ex might get exposed & and the girls can't keep their legs closed
As she put her lips close to the ear lobes saying words in my ear like
[?] com'on lets head on the bedroom; Goddamn
Yea gift & a curse and i don't mean everything that you see is perfect
Everything that the game bring gave us answers and chance
Stay clear of the fucking circus as the earth spin
Trying to find a purpose in this lifetime
Last year no wasn't in my right mind
09 oh that's a year in my lifeline
The whole time i wondered could i expose mine?
Or show the whole world another part of both sides
I'm like BAM my nigga Baatin died
Shit I'm like dam
My mans the one that helped me in the game back then
Wish i could rewind time just to go back then
Classic song and classic flow
& fuck this rap shit he listen to classic gold
One classic [?]
It seems one minute your hear the next minute your friends gone
Parade rained one like we stayed in the stone
Get a call with a voice crying on my phone
Something wrong when hexed, everything slowed down
Besides my truck on the road I'm in now m doing 100 miles per hour, I'm gone
No not hexed, much later seen a little more progress, but I'm still stressed couldn't move
Locked in the gloom trying to spit my way out this hot spitters room
But he let us know keep going, so until i get better i keep flowing
With every endeavor i speak on keeps me ahead like a leap forward
With any and every each song keep GOING!
Yea so i came back asap, a rap for niggas until my aunt died
Now my brains back brain lapsed same trap
Same year different scenario same tears from the same crap
& and i don't want this to interfere;
I'm one of a kind but the the only one that's here
Only one left but with the peers
Niggas arrive for him but hes the only one who steers
The steal wheel until his career is finally here;
Album of the year
