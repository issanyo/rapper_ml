Verse 1:
My mindset readjusted, rhyme vet didn't need a budget
Gettin' to be stubborn, type of niggas givin' me production
Had me feeling like I didn't need a subject
Didn't need the substance, just a bit jaded
Evaded risk taking now I'm thinkin' nothing of it
I been this patient, givin' to the public
My interpretation of the music I grew up
My determination got my money movin' upwards
Not enough for me to make it but at least it's something
Speaking through the speaker, tryna keep from dumb shit
Reekin' from the reefer 'cause my peoples keep a blunt lit
Preconceived notions, most them weak assumptions
That's the reason that I been feenin' to ether something
Why diss a few when I can teach and reach a dozen
I bet you skipped to 2 just to see if the beat was bumpin'
It's Low Budget or nothing

Hook:
Say goodbye to the guy that you're used to/two
Fingers in the sky get 'em high this is crucial
And you can slide to the side if you're used to
The same bullshit and the lies and the usual
Say goodbye to the guy that you're used to/two
Fingers in the sky get 'em high this is crucial
And you can slide to the side if you're used to
The same bullshit and the lies and the usual

Verse 2:
I'm walking by faith like Big on his wedding day
On my second jay while a Otis Redding record play
Check the resume', I ain't one of you draft picks
A playground legend that's stressin' being a has been
In a industry where you only good as your last hit
And I never had hits so it didn't surprise me
Same niggas that was behind me never mind me
Didn't ride, switchin' sides quicker than an eye blink, I
Could've ignored them, low and behold a cosign more important
Recorded a song with Big Sean and Folarin
Now all of a sudden I'm flooded with them niggas callin'
They figured they could find me
When that call get declined, figured that I'm grimey
Middle fingers to them niggas kindly, that's your beef
Astros fitted on, you know what they call me
Two N's and two R's, you niggas should applaud me

Hook:
Say goodbye to the guy that you're used to/two
Fingers in the sky get 'em high this is crucial
And you can slide to the side if you're used to
The same bullshit and the lies and the usual
Say goodbye to the guy that you're used to/two
Fingers in the sky get 'em high this is crucial
And you can slide to the side if you're used to
The same bullshit and the lies and the usual

Look brother it's real, low budget for real
Nights sleepin' on futons eatin' on lukewarm nuggets for meals
You make it rain 'cause you flooded with bills, I'm making change
Lookin' for a fair shot, niggas cut me a deal
My mailbox still flooded with bills, if they complain
'Bout me taking so long making those songs
They can hold on, I'm just tryna give 'em something that's real
'Cause the pressure is on
Steady strive for perfection, they expecting the norm
Switched the style for a second, took a lesson from Born
Was gettin' loud for a second I was messin' with chron
But never fucked with no pills
You can say whatever you want, never front on my skill
One in a mill versus run of the mill, let's speak on it
All it took was a blunt and some bill to get my brothers to build
They say they wanted that real, my team on it

Say goodbye to the guy that you're used to/two
Fingers in the sky get 'em this is crucial
And you can slide to the side if you're used to
The same bullshit and the lies and the usual
Say goodbye to the guy that you're used to/two
Fingers in the sky get 'em this is crucial
And you can slide to the side if you're used to
The same bullshit and the lies and the usual
