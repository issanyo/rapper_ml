[Verse 1: Wiki]
Me and Droog, you can't see us
You can't read us, you believe us?
You might as well believe in Jesus
Jesus, we too ugly, fuck us
Think you want us
Till you meet 'em, then you dump us
Then you leave 'em, what's the reason?
We just mixed up, it's a sit-and-see every season

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
I don't know what she sees in me
Never was cute, or had a reason to be
My beauty is enhanced by money like Russell Simmons
I'm a gremlin, only handsome to ugly women
Very fat chick, geriatric
And then severely handicapped, that's a hat-trick
On the ave with the rats and tryna catch vics
Still smoking, need a patch, pass it to Patrick

[Verse 3: Wiki]
Laugh at it, still kinda mad at it
You a bastard, a new addict
I'm clean-lunged, but be dumb about everything else
From the sea to the sun
And that's the homies from Coney
So you ain't even reaching the beaches, till it's December
Yo we freezin', winter we be grilling
Summer we be cheesin', spread far and we in between 'em

[Verse 4: Your Old Droog]
Can't see 'em, son came in strong
Now these restaurants inscribe my name in tongs (I'm eatin')
Had next for too long, went from WIC checks
To getting me and Wik' checks for this song
Royalties, mechanical ones for my mechanics
It's all semantics, you losers getting on with some antics
I'm just busting my gun, son
And got a smoking addiction that Chantix can't fix

[Hook: Wiki and Your Old Droog]
