[Intro]
Yeah, uh

[Chorus]
You could say I'm putting on, put my heart in every song I guess
Niggas tryna be the best, wouldn't go for nothing less
You could say I'm in the zone I guess
Till my very last breath, watchin' every last step till the casket close I guess
What it is? Just another product of the bottom, let 'em live
Hustle yeah we got it let me show 'em how it is, ah

You could say I'm putting on, put my heart in every song I guess
Niggas tryna be the best, wouldn't go for nothing less
You could say I'm in the zone I guess
Till my very last breath, watchin' every last step till the casket close I guess
What it is? Just another product of the bottom, let 'em live
Hustle yeah we got it let me show 'em how it is, ah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I tell them bad days good bye, adi√≥s
The kid with the 90 fro and a snotty nose
All of my homies got high cause of being low
Wasn't any [?] designer clothes, never
Now we fast forward, things seem a little better
Had time to reflect, little time to reconnect
Wise man told me "make time for the money"
Time's money so I only make time for a check
So my niggas reach for the Moon
Silver Lining so I bop to an iller tune
Used to sit inside the living room of the crib
No chandelier, high ceiling nor a silver spoon, wasn't born with it
Now they book tickets so we going for a visit just to walk around stage over forty-five minutes
Hear a plague for us, curtain call for us, calling all [?] now they can't ignore
Used to write rhymes, no chorus, while mobbing in the tours
Steady schoolin' niggas but college wasn't for us
But I knew my dreams was always getting bigger
And like the movie screen I always seen the bigger picture
Even when you live around niggas that's dark as night and killers that lose their cool like defrost on ice
Pulling out two's on fools that turn into mice and uh, let me get it right

[Chorus]
You could say I'm putting on, put my heart in every song I guess
Niggas tryna' be the best, wouldn't go for nothing less
You could say I'm in the zone I guess
Till my very last breath, watchin' every last step till the casket close I guess
What it is? Just another product of the bottom, let 'em live
Hustle yeah we got it let me show 'em how it is, ah

[Verse 2]
Yeah, line for line, only truth in my legs bruh
You never find lies living in my literature
Giving you the feelin' that's focused in fact
No room for [?]
No room to act, I'm giving you back dosis
Memories of bare room walls with rap posters
Blacker than the burn on the folders, or blaze
Blacker than Isaac Hayes on stages Black Moses
Not just Token Black only black for you to flow rap over soul slap
This the ending of an age, but beginning of a page to a new chapter
Here for the long run like the long song of the rapper's time shorter than an interlude after
End of the world rap, new rapture
Can't make moves with you then we move past you
Gasoline with two matches

[Chorus]
You could say I'm putting on, put my heart in every song I guess
Niggas tryna be the best, wouldn't go for nothing less
You could say I'm in the zone I guess
Till my very last breath, watchin' every last step till the casket close I guess
What it is? Just another product of the bottom, let 'em live
Hustle yeah we got it let me show 'em how it is, ah

You could say I'm putting on, put my heart in every song I guess
Niggas tryna be the best, wouldn't go for nothing less
You could say I'm in the zone I guess
Till my very last breath, watchin' every last step till the casket close I guess
What it is? Just another product of the bottom, let 'em live
Hustle yeah we got it let me show 'em how it is, ah
