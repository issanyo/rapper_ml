(Verse 1)

I was about to say that
I don't amount to they're expectations
All around me is cement walls
And all
I really, think about is waking up in
My own bed for a change
I'm stuck in this bad place full of fallen angels...
Soooooo, next time
I'ma think real hard 'fore I do shit
I'ma think "Is it smart, or stupid?"
And if it's stupid, I ain't gon DO it
When I get my freedom, I ain't gonna lose it, no -
Cuz when I went to court
I treated it like a sport
Thinkin' "Yeah, they gotta PROVE it..."
No. No. No...
My first week here, I thought I was gonna lose it, whoa -
They like: "Clothing off, against the wall
Cup/tuck your balls, bend over and cough (AGAIN)
Cough (AGAIN) - Okay, now fuck off"
What a cost for breaking a bit of the law off for myself...
Eyyo, these ain't bunks, they're shelves;
And we're defective products they can't sell
Like "oh, well"

(Chorus)
Man, this here's jail...jail
I miss my daughter, my mom, my female
It's jail...with no bail...
I know I ain't got long, but yo, still...
It's jail...it's real...
22 hours a day in my cell
It's jail...and it's HELL
But ain't nobody to blame but myself

(Bridge/Verse 2)
Yo
Death threats and daily assaults
Radio station TV
Gen-pop and Closed Program
Ad-Seg, the Hole and P.C

If you're P.C., you's a rat
If you're P.C., you's a snitch
If you're P.C., you're either puss-y
Or you're diddlin' kids
I was Gen-pop, Unit 1/Unit 3, middle teir -
Only had two cellies
Both named Gabriel - (ain't that weird?)
Why the fuck am I in here
Dining with crime pioneers?
I am in line, not tryna hear
The violence in my ears
Walking the yard in a square
Thinkin bout washing my hair
But wanting no parts of them showers
Rather smell odd than go there
There was one guard that was fair
"Fez" we could call him
But there was also a lot of 'em there
That wasn't so fair
Cuz this here is

(Chorus)
Man, this here's jail...jail
Strangers going through your mail
It's jail...with no bail...
Lookin mad unhealthy and pale
It's jail...it's real...
22 hours a day in my cell
It's jail...and it's HELL....

(Verse 3)
...but ain't nobody to blame but that judge with
A big ol' grudge against me
Mad cuz her water jug is empty
Looking at me like a thug with a
Brain full of drugs
Out there tryna jack a ten-speed
Yeah, I broke into a warehouse...
And it was unlawful entry...
But she acting like it was her house...
And she caught me in her pantry
Hence, I got jailtime for my first offence
Great view of the barbed-wire fence
In a fish tank it's a bit rank
From the stench of about 55 gents
I'm dead-last
In the line for Med Pass
Go ahead, cut ahead and get a head-mash
At eleven, go to bed and get a lead nap
Sheet noose - neck snap
C.O.'s like "Get back! Get back!"
Breath stinkin like shit, need a Tic Tac
Canteen is the currency
You wanna burn some weed with meeee?
Gimme a Kit Kat
Can't wait til my bid gets over
Sittin' in here while my kid gets older
Rockin, reelin, looking life over
Talkin/feelin/lookin like Yoda
Reading like a book-a-night, sober
Never sleep for more than 20 minutes
Kinda kave to keep one eye open
Just in case there's any funny business
What is this?
I'm Zoboomafoo in a human zoo
Whatever wrongs you have done to me
I will...

(Chorus 3)
...do to you, in jail...jail
Where the soup is cold, the bread stale
It's jail...with no bail
I know I ain't got long, but yo, still...
It's jail...it's real...
22 hours a day in my cell...
It's jail...and it's HELL
But ain't nobody to blame except...

Who???
