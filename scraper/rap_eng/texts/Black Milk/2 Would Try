[Verse 1]
Yeah, you and I
Seemed like we both had a thing only two would try
Where the love lie
Now we on some do or die
(Know what I'm saying)
Yeah, who am I to deserve where your curves in
After all those niggas you was curving
Kicked to the curb, shit wasn't working
Cut 'em off, block calls, closed curtains
Yeah behind closed curtains
Very little flirting
Lot of no pants, no shirt and
Follow your wave to the edge of the earth and
Back already seen where the worst at
Something real, I could tell you was worth that
Needed a drink and I fell for your thirst trap
Good times when we were trapped
Them bad times wish I could go back and reverse that
Find where the hurt at
Searching, no stress from before
With any ex's sending X's and O's
A cold world but as long as we know before we step in the cold

[Hook]
Maybe this is something two could try
Maybe feels like something for you and I
To go
And the feeling's strong
Feeling it's right even if it's wrong

[Verse 2]
Temptation
Waiting for the perfect, impatient
So you settled for something but now it's hatred
Had to face it
Can't erase it, relationship
That relation shit, hoping for the best
Now you're trying to make another change
Now going down the same road
So we changed and drove in another lane
Head above the clouds, been on another plane
What about that love that we found
Young from a club, from a car to a couch
To the covers and the springs that'd bounce
How it worked out even when her friends had doubts
And your friends had doubts
Now the same friends wanna have what we have now, listen
Never causing for you to hurt
You the moon, you the stars, you the universe
And if somebody gotta fall, I'ma do it first
And if this cause was a crime I would do the dirt

Yeah

[Hook]
Maybe this is something that two could try
Maybe feels like something for you and I
To go
And the feeling's strong
Feeling it's right even if it's wrong
