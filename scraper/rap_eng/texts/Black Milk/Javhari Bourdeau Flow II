[Part 1]
Back to the music, that's the game plan
Look inside my thoughts, yeah you see a changed man
From rags to riches
Sorta like a bad commitment
They said I had too much drive, I need a Countach
I took a lot of losses, but I'm winning like a montage
Rap it on this beat that my idol gave me to persevere
Shoutout Black Milk
Tryna switch the whole access when my verse is a pit
Surprise niggas, you clowns done fucked up now
Chopping heads off and throwing all the corpses in ditches
Gave 'em the vision, took me for granted
They let me, I'm drifting away from what I used to be
I feel like I'm already dead inside
The kid I used to be is long gone from here
I can't let 'em down with my own career

[Part 2]
(One, two, three, huh)
They out here killing blacks, they out here killing blacks
[?] ain't there on the fucking [?]
Pistol to his head, he never had a chance
Still nothing there than a pool of blood
What is that mean for America
Young black man getting killed again
Old hood burning to the ground though
I wonder if we ever make it out of this
Niggas hating on me, niggas hating on me
Wonder if they really know anything
Faith is a consequence of fear though
I don't have the fear but a hand though
Told myself we going out with a bang
Told myself I'm going out with a bang
Dream so real, so fucking real
