[Hook: Black Milk and Sample]
Try to find what you can get
But all they dish you up is shit
(Stop talking shit)
Look around, we're folding Earth
Try to find out what it's worth
What it’s worth, worth
What it’s, what it’s worth

[Verse 1: Black Milk]
Honestly, gotta ask myself
Time and time what I’m working for
Is it worth it, though?
Look at fam realize what I’m working towards
Keep they pockets filled with stacks
Gotta keep food up in they fridge
Keep my moms up out of that trap
Keep my bro up out of that pen
Never had a land in hand, always had to play my part
Play it smart
Artist about his craft
But sometimes survival is bigger than art
Yo, this life is bigger than me, feel weighed down by a hundred boulders
Got family on my hands, crown on my head, city on top of my shoulders
Fuck what these niggas say, fuck what these niggas think
It ain’t worth the time
When you got fans with they hands in the air
Making sure you don't gotta work a regular job on a regular
You got niggas tryna live they dream
But you got niggas that live the reality, not tryna live above they means
This what, this kinda life I dream
Two shots to the head, two shots till we dead
Just what this kind of life might bring
That’s what this kinda night might mean
You clock in or be glocked in, OGs here, no stopping
As long as breath’s in my lungs waving white flags ain’t never the option

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Black Milk]
I see I’m talking and debating about my rating
If I only had one fan rating me high I could never feel underrated
So I hear too many questions about
Why you not working, when the latest out
Never was one to go to another one just to feel validated ’bout
Shit I’m doing, all around the world
Tryina give ‘em what they asking for
Yeah, I’m good from the borough all the way to Euro
Hood pass with a passport
Hit a toenail, go back to the Mo
But it sound like we’re raised around criminals just to hear shots outside of the door
Give a fuck less about shots and subliminals
So so so so
Let it breathe, let it doze
Me and my niggas had dreams, cashing checks with seven Os
PA, Westside, hop in the truck like let’s ride
Mom’s looking at the time, hoping that her oldest son make it back inside
And I did that, live by a code, live for tomorrow
Walk down streets where empty hollows stray, sidewalks where broken bottles lay
I did that, went from boom-bap in the day, go rap round the neck
Double track and the deck, lay it back on cassette
Yeah, yeah, they lived that
