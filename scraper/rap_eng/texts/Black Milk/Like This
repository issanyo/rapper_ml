Push me over the edge, you gon' get a rock slide
Allow me to cut up, you gon' need peroxide
Drop heat on the street, get fried while blazing
By now my style is eyebrow-raising
Long awaited, so many songs is dated
You looked at me as if I'm wrongly stated, huh?
You mad peeved cause I make my riches rain
Plus I'm on your bitch's brain like it's stitches in a bad weave
Yo, I tell a wack nigga go (Go)
You think the flow blow, wait until the solo
Carry a four-four, hate the po-po
My bro is low pro, chopping more bricks than a dojo
The dog is out the trap fence, you're perhaps tense
Cause you ain't rap, you just yapped since my absence
So hi haters I'm back off hiatus
With my latest, mega-fly so why rate this?
I, your worst case scenario in stereo
Tailor make your suit so you can wear it for your burial
What I said was over your head so call it aerial
I stay sitting on top, position where the cherry go
What I spit inside the booth's bananas
I won't up and disappear, go poof and vanish
But on the real, I'm for the legacy and culture
You beg to be the joker, then you're egging me to yoke ya
You pull a girl but I get 'em in plural, I'm thorough
And from behind I make 'em curl like they hurled to earl
The way you bust in this rap world is sterile
And when I take you out you still gon' be twirled to swirl
