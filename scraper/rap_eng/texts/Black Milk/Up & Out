[Hook:]
My niggas know, they know what up
Shout out to [?], he know what's up
You want that money? I need a hun
You better get up, get out, and get some
You lookin' 'round like it ain't nunin', shit
Tryna stunt, yo we tryna run shit
Minim wadge my nigga, you talkin' dumb shit
I need the crib, need the truck, I'm feedin' fo' kids

[Verse:]
You've seen hell before? my niggas already live it
If there's a hell below, then we already in it
Tell ya white friends though come and pay us a visit
Our neighborhoods don't look like they're don't be scared
When you see teddy bears and like 4s everywhere
You see streets watching everywhere you be
You see cops hop out on high school dropout
Hear 'em shout out "freeze! Get on the ground!"
But, but we made it out
Now we stay where the money's at, you  jinx'd that
[?] slayin' that lay on they backs
And do whatever we sayin', we stayin' below

[Hook:](2x)
