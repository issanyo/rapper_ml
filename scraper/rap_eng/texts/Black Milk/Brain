[Hook - Black Milk]
Wake up, the new shake up
It's to make up, the crew break up
The wait is over
Thug out, wait up
Who said get over?
No doubt, wake up
[2x]

[Verse 1 - Black Milk]
True minds are mine, 2 minds combined
When/where in time from the red sin skyline
It's match-up, it's madness with magic
2 of the most finest putting classics on the canvas
But, it's no use, no paints, no inks
The vocals turn into visions on display once he speaks
But, take a seat, the story begins here
Family defined, always surrounded by mad peers
The hell ?, instead of holding that 9-5
Will blow trees with OGs they idolize
Moms trying to keep her son close by
Pops worked all day, couldn't keep a close eye
So I had something that wasn't in each home
Raised white, but still I knew the street code
Ran with some honor-roll kids who ran with hella crooks
That keep a couple guns in their locker instead of books
Hoop dreams, jump shots with hella hooks
All got shot down by bullets and lives took
Cries, mom's tears fell on the casket
Summer's off to college, but never made it to campus
He's from a block where they consider it ? alarm
Friends gone, get drawn and tatted on their arm
Don't be alarmed, we all singing the same song
A million souls, we all singing the same song

[Hook - Black Milk]
Wake up, the new shake up
Is to make up, crews break up
The wait is over, no doubt, wait up
Who's taking over? No doubt, wait up
