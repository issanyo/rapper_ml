HOOK (2x)
Puffin on a loosie, the world got me stressed
From these fake rappers making checks
Take another pull, feel it in your chest
Louie Gonz, Evan Black is a threat

VERSE 1 (Louie Gonz)
We gave em Da Joint, gave em Return, gave em Repeat
Fatal with words tables have turned up on the beat
Paving the street, we all hustling tryna make ends meet
I let the pen bleed, people gone envy
The best rookie out since Jordan came from NC
Jump on the wagon I'm a G like a Benz jeep
All these rappers sound ass to me
Claimin your the best please with no classic?! Sheesh
Forget a vest when I'm aiming for the headshot
Here's my last dance with devil cause I'm red hot
So let the track sizzle, when you rap
Gotta kill em with facts and that's something I never lack kiddo
Gotta get cash so I can whip the black Enzo
Put the windows down flick ashes of the indo
Pour me some cognac, only the Henn bro
Illustrate a masterpiece with one penstroke

HOOK (2x)

VERSE 2 (Evan Black)
Check it out man this world's got me stressed out
Second guessing if I'm taking the best route
I look around man it's like they're handing checks out
To wack rappers who don't even deserve a guest shout
I'm tryna push that LFA Lexus
Black diamond baguettes man, no question
Unless your name's Gonz, consider your suggestions irrelevant
I stay making them investments
I'm sipping the SoCo slow while I'm swerving
Perfect timed words, disturb minds suburban
To dope boys on the block steady grind serving
I service dimes, leave em with they spine curling
(Puffin on a loosie) In a soft top coupe
Switching lanes zig zags of that Blue Dream
Evan Black motherfucker, I'm that new heat
When I write it's like I set fire to the loose leaf

HOOK (2x)
