[Black Milk]
The story begins with me and her just friends of friendship
It, took a spin now we're friends with benefits
It, can get old then again I'm feelin' it
On her
Sober or drunk she bendin' it, over
Talkin' shit, sayin' that she in it for the long run (I don't believe it nigga)
She tryin' to get a hit like a home run (she already know)
Tryin' to hit a lick like her own tongue
(And why's that?)
Cause she's seen the whip with the chrome ones
Sayin' she doesn't care about stardom
But wanna be the first to walk on the red carpet
Walkin'
When they hear 'em announce
Her name, talkin' 'bout her dress she can't even pronounce
Nope, this ain't gon' work, you outta there
Tried to play a nigga, now you gotta bounce like bobblehead
Uh, it's me, it's cold as AC
Another song for the gold diggers like 'Ye and Jamie
