[Intro]
Money, moolah
Young niggas with money
Show them what's up, let's show them what's up
Count it if you can
Count it if you can
Count it if you fucking can!
Count it if you, can you count it?
There's too much to count

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay (x2)

[Hook: Black Milk]
And I can't lie
You niggas ride to die
You balling or you barely getting by
All we really wanted, wanted was a piece of the pie
All we wanted was a piece of the pie
Nah I can't lie
See them dollar signs in my eye
Pray to God and hope I don't die
All we really wanted, wanted was a piece of the pie
All we wanted was a piece of the pie
I can't lie
You niggas ride to die
You balling or you barely getting by
All we really wanted, wanted was a piece of the pie
All we wanted was a piece of the pie

[Verse 1: Black Milk]
Yeah since a young age
Maybe since the fifth grade
Niggas always been about they hustle
See my nigga Randy on the bus and
Selling penny candies during luncheon
Quarter waters made a couple bucks then
Standing by the fence
Lemonheads, one for 50 cents
Sold it for a little cheaper than he flipped
Adidas three stripes was the kicks
That he wanted
Recess outside, where the kids usually called him
They wanted cheaper
Then the store bought 'em
He already knew something
That the teachers never taught him
How to (how to)
How to get it
Yeah he got them new sneaks
Plus copped a new fitted

[Hook: Black Milk]
I can't lie
You niggas ride to die
You balling or you barely getting by
All we really wanted, wanted was a piece of the pie
All we wanted was a piece of the pie
Nah I can't lie
See them dollar signs in my eye
Pray to God and hope I don't die
All we really wanted, wanted was a piece of the pie
All we wanted was a piece of the pie

[Verse 2: Black Milk]
Yeah, yeah
Sitting on the couch, turned the channel to the box
Cousin in the kitchen whip, whipping up a pot
Every 25 minutes outside I hear a knock
At the door, somebody asking him for another cop (cop)
Cop another rock (rock)
After that go whip another pot
Homie sitting on the porch, they on watch
Curiosity killed the cat
Was curious about the stacks
(Say yo, yo, yo how you do that)
Little nigga didn't I tell you stay up in a room
Go play with your other cousin, yeah yo mama coming soon
You liking what you see, huh?
Tired of mama, wanna buy your own things, huh?
Let me show you something, how to get the green, ah
Guess you old enough, you turning 14 now
Let's go and get it now

[Bridge: Black Milk]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay (x2)

[Hook: Black Milk]
And I can't lie
You niggas ride to die
You balling or you barely getting by
All we really wanted, wanted was a piece of the pie
All we wanted was a piece of the pie
Nah I can't lie
See them dollar signs in my eye
Pray to God and hope I don't die
All we really wanted, wanted was a piece of the pie
All we wanted was a piece of the pie

[Verse 3: Pete Rock]
Coming from the apple, gotta stay fly
Luxury cars, 745s
Bars is finito, everything live
Rolling up Obama, got to stay fried
Live in the moment, word to the wise
Get to the money, maintain your pride
Always stay humble, then get to the prize
I'm like Martin in life trying to get the pie yeah
The chocolate boy wonder
Nobody does it better
Need at least 15 in to get up on my level
I'm still here, still make beats that's special
My name Pete Rock, I'mma stay real forever

[Outro: Black Milk]
(Forever ever? Forever ever? Forever ever?)
Piece of the pie
Want, wanted was a piece of the pie
