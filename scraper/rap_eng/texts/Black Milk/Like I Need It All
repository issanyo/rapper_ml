[Intro]
Show 'em who is better, iller with the letter
Realest shit I ever, wrote
Hold up, try that again

[Verse 1]
Forty eight hours with no sleep
On the high but still keeping it low key
There's no need to go sleep
Most rappers already comatose
Let 'em OD, half-dead overdose
Go sleep, I stay woke for the most part I recognize
Even when the music's hittin' and the checks is written
Nigga like me still not satisfied
I'm at a time where I analyze and enterprise
Puttin' words in your speakers like intercoms
For the ones that identify, feel minimized
Outlaw feelin' outcast, Aquemini
Inner eye talking, in my last song
You niggas know this life don't last long
Everyday going out your way
Feeling like you got one shot left like last calls
Being from the city lakes, I can show you what it really takes
I used be him, putting short money in a piggy bank
We need the BM gettin' DMs, sent from a pretty face
Anyway and any case, the right now with a lifestyle
What your life's like now is what they askin'
Answers, what I wrote down in my last one
Answers, things 'bout to pass in my past, look

[Chorus]
I couldn't imagine the day gettin' paid off this melody
Now we on stage it's amazing so what is you tellin' me
Look, everybody runnin' for the spot, on top, don't fall
I don't need much, not much (naw), but I hustle like I need it all

[Verse 2]
Yeah, close to the end, focused holdin' a pen
Rather write it down instead of holdin' it in
No guarantees, so you're hopin' to win
Everybody see it different when you look through they lens
Friends see you as the man, puttin' up grands
All you see is hands up, hookin' your fam up
Girls see you band up, keepin' her glammed up
See, your haters wanna see where you land up
Enemies only see the day when you jammed up
So they stay low where you stand up
Mom see you in a halo, cops see you in handcuffs
But, couldn't forfeit 'til we seen a fortress
Drivin' in a Ford, lookin' at the Forbes list
Hood torture, praying for good fortune
Waiting for the clear but still hearing distortion like

[Chorus]
I couldn't imagine the day gettin' paid off this melody
Now we on stage it's amazing so what is you tellin' me
Look, everybody runnin' for the spot, on top, don't fall
I don't need much, not much (naw), but I hustle like I need it all
