[Melanie Rutherford]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What's really good though?

[Verse 1]
I ain't tryna be all salty and bitter
And take looks at her facebook wall and being all stalkin' her twitter
Was involved then we split up
But stayed fuck buddies for cutty believe she know who to call and to hit up
And it's on when we get up
Frontin' like ain't no feelings at all it's a setup
She all for it, I'm playing along saying "you better not fall for it Kenneth"
We been goin' back and forth for a minute
We straddling the fence, convinced
She never had it so intense but then
It never matters in the end, so when-
Ever she call I'ma keep hittin' ignore and start
Cuttin' her off, keep your distance
Good lord she persistent
She lured me to give in, attraction entrapment
Swore she the victim, man that broad need attention
And it's hard not to give it 'cause she stacked like a Braxton
Fine from the front, from the back she immaculate

[Chorus - Melanie Rutherford]
You and I need to define what we gon' be
Is it really you and me, yeah
You and I need to define what we gon' be
Is it you and me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Bad habits harder to break
Her attitude make it harder to stay
She wear her heart on her sleeve
That's the reason that its harder to leave
I'm the only one that's hard to believe but she don't owe me nothing
'Cause we only fuckin' that's what started the beef
Homie/lover play your part keep it neat, don't get messy
I just leave, dippin' the minute this chick stress me
What she expect when she causing me grief
Same scene, hittin' pause and repeat
The trees tonic and gin making platonic friends harder to be
My first pick, now she part of team
But on the bench, keep her hooked like Hakeem Olajuwon and Kareem
Need a queen with thighs thick as Mary Blige in that scene
From "Real Love" fuck the lies and the schemes so what's it gon' be
You want me, jealously intervene
The definition, lettin' Melanie sing and bring melody

[Chorus]
