[Chorus: Mick Jenkins]
You can catch me
On the wave no jet ski
Ice cold no Gretzky
I don't got time to figure out how I feel, for real
I don't got a mind to figure out the fake and the real, at all
I don't got dollars to deepen my pockets
Still got dimes, they nipping at the back of my heels
'Cause I look good (Look good)
I dress good (Look good, dress good)
Smoke good (Smoke good)
I stress a lot (Stress a lot)

[Bridge: Mick Jenkins]
Who do I run to?
The papers in frontal the pain that is subdue
They can't see me undo
They can't see me undone, I'm too lit right now
I'm big on the internet, pretend I ain't into that (Let me hear that)

[Verse 1: Mikahl Anthony]
Love provides the fruits that don't live too far from the tree
A peace of mind for her, the other half I can't be
Why should I give a fuck about feelings? (Feelings)
My heart's getting cold (Iceberg, ice cold)
A piece of me to you is getting
Harder

[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
It's been in my experience that whenever you show yourself
For real, for real, you know
Motherfuckers like to take advantage, standing there naked you panic
When vantage points don't get expanded
They offer you anecdotes based on the man that you were
More than the man that you plan to be
I go right back to the cannabis
It's harder to change the intangibles
But I know I didn't get this way randomly
Handing me cards that were played in advance
So while I poke her face, she stare grinning handsomely
Six hands ahead of me, had to be
Clean up my school, and janitor habits he gladly see
But there's just some things that I never speak
There's just some things that

[Chorus: Mick Jenkins]
You can catch me (But you can't catch me that's the thing)
On the wave no jet ski
Ice cold no Gretzky
I don't got time to figure out how I feel, for real
I don't got a mind to figure out the fake and the real, at all
I don't got dollars to deepen my pockets
Still got dimes, they nipping at the back of my heels
Cause I look good (Look good)
I dress good (Look good, dress good)
Smoke good (Smoke good)
I stress a lot (Stress a lot)

[Outro]
Who do I run to?
The papers in frontal the pain that is subdue
They can't see me undo
They can't see me undone
I'm too lit right now
I'm big on the internet
I'm big on the internet
