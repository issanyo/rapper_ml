[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, I know you want it better
Yeah, yeah, I know you want forever
Yeah, yeah, I know you want it better
Yeah, yeah, hold up, tell me what's been running in that mind
I hope I was, tell you something you done only think in minds
Yeah you does

[Verse 1]
Look, sometimes yeah I did you wrong
Sometimes yeah I was living wrong
Never wanted you to feel alone
Never wanted you to say the feeling's gone
Too gone, too much time in the zone
Too much time in the studio
Even right now when I put you in this song
You chose to respect when I'm in the zone
Tryna' get the whip and a bigger home
But you don't really care 'bout that, 'bout that
Wanna be where I'm (I'm), I wanna be where I'm at
Can't promise this will be the ever bump heads
I leave the room a hot head, you storm to the room upstairs but
We make up just the way you like
Make up when you spend the night
In the dark don't need a light
I see the light when I see the sight
You right there what I need in life
This just a surface, no one's perfect
Hope one day I get it right

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, I know you want it better
Yeah, yeah, I know you want forever
Yeah, yeah, I know you want it better
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Look, tell me where yo' feelings at
Tears of laughter, morning after
Tell me if we still a match
Tell you that "you still attached"
Now I gotta make a move, now I gotta make her choose
Never wanna make a fool, of myself, take us through
Moments I took you for granted, granted I was on some other shit
With another chick I landed
We was both on other planets but you walked me back to Earth that day (like)
Part me up, part to be up, when you love our hearts to meet up
Part to beat us, part to see us, art dominion stay martin gene, got that

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, I know you want it better
Yeah, yeah, I know you want forever
Yeah, yeah, I know you want it better
Yeah
