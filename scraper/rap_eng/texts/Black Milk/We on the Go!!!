[Chorus:]
Shit like this
Give me such a good feeling
Right here such a good feeling
Reminisce back when didn’t have a dealing
Now we back here trying to make a million
Go go we gone if you wanna holla (hey yo hey yo)
We back we on a chase for them dollars
We on the go
We killing em and it feels so good (hey yo hey yo)
As filler we hope the point is understood

[Verse 1:]
It’s payday we getting paid players know we raise it up
All about your grind now
Look at my clique we linking up
Loved it when we broke it up
Back of the club post it up
Thought it was all over game over for the both of us
Nah we just oped it up
Why cuz it’s more to us
Than what you see in the screen from the cameras
Responsibility changes to challenge us
Standing on the front line waiting just to tackle it
Backtrack a bit but I flip like a gymnast
Turn my life around it’s the life of the realist
The price of the gifted
Despite all the attention
I wouldn’t give it up that’s the price of admission

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Pierce for the green
The killer loved to hit now jack with a spade
The troops automatic to goof
Geranium with a shot
Geronimo with a suit
Pinching a four with a camera before got
Stamina parachute on my waist
Got erupting your seat
40 miles in the street
Break it down in the 20
We hit the block and it’s hot
Rolling down it be sunny
80 miles and we hot
Photographing a photo with camouflage in the spot
Another words we live in the hard nothing less
With your foot to the pedal going hard to the metal
65 in a 70 automatic 100
Camouflage in a photo but got a picture you are
Motivating expansion on the way to the top
Keep it moving onto jail on the way to the top
Keep it moving baby

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Keep the drama in conversation no time for waiting
No man let’s go man need concentration
I’m chosen I’m Conan combination
Don’t approach a spokesman for aggravation
Y’all don’t wanna face him
You know my kid courageous
On your playlist the A list we rep the stages
We are the ultimate and all n*gga
You need to embrace this

[Chorus:]
Give me such a good feeling
Right here such a good feeling
Reminisce back when didn’t have a dealing
Now we back here trying to make a million
Go hey yo hey yo
We on the go
We are on the go
Hey yo hey yo
We on the go
