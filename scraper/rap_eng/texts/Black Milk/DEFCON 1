(Verse 1: Johnny Napalm)
This ya death wish, check this, nigga who you trying to step with?
I check chins, a veteran to just a freshman
Embedded with excellence in the flesh
The indirect addresses you sended never affected
Repeatedly seize your pre-releases and ether
Every single thing you proceeded to peep and leech from
To reach us, your team gets eaten in the arena
Better re-up, my metaphor is a megastorm
You menopause MC’s better off with a lexicon
Of a mental home, we been up on other echelons
Get wetted on, get gone and stepping off quick
That wack shit’s backwards, never been less involved with
Finish written precision and spit it, y’all niggas history
Written sentences filled with synonyms of a guillotine
Kid please, my sixteens flip keys, it’s dopeness
Your split clean, this split screen is coached with

(Verse 2: Limited Infinity)
Acidosis, weight elapse, explode of gas
Industry holds in grass, law inverses gold for cash
I expose aftermath, calculate Egyptian circumstance
You serpent rants infer turbulence
Seen your service, you breathe in purses
When I fiend with purpose, wigs, um see, undercurrents
Need shutters merged inside your verbs
Your actions ain't heard, 41 bullets in your worth
World serene like shit advert, just been occurred
Matured adjusting fence in to ghetto birds
Dispensed, no defense, hence your kleptic burns, this where credits learned
8 steps 'til fed tax returns, relax your earns
Suck breath and finance your term, word expanse as nocturnal
To 70's Bronx tales is flexed fertile
Texts leave y'all who bitch kept nonverbal
Digest universal coming from what's internal

(Verse 3: Johnny Napalm)
I say, y’all nigga’s verses iffy
How them wack shit tactics gonna work against me?
You can get it first, and be the first of many
Send bucks over the dollars like Dirk Nowitzki
That First Amendment stressed when I murder the speech
Leave tops through the roof like convertible seats
Ends is tight, on the corner’s where you burst, and release
But that’s a stretch from the jump like a vertical reach
How you supposed to measure up to the God flow?
You napping on the kid, get them cuffs and a blindfold
Y’all been confessing up since a zygote
Like a million bucks, we could find you next to the 5-0’s
Y’all got me exasperated
Add the 8, get divided like a math equation
Won’t miss shots, that’s vaccinations
Pass when I got them on you like Jack LaLanne, kid

(Verse 4: Limited Infinity)
Rip in skins exploits the vital nerve
Gotcha open, purrs see Nile squirm the urge
Buck 50, that's the Trojan word
Molds flows in firms, load us from la fern you learn
Enclose wack, smack growth, light in the attic
Overhead, throne in hair it's composed parakeets
Weave a wear cherish hits, the broker lips spits
From chaps and clips, to raps with dead presidents
Embezzled sensei, techniques pencil on breaks
They contacts, copy page season, parsley, lyonnaise
Serves times crime fitness, oral rhymes and gram crackers
Oculus gather this perceives it chatter slanderous
Cams plague canister in cloud as minutes stir
In vows written in loss like sufficient Cobras
Summers missing book add focus, cash courses
Upgrade your lexile, DEFCON fiend morses
