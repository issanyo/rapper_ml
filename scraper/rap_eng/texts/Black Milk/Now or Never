[Hook: Black Milk]
Yeah, yeah
Nah ain't nothing better
I put that on whatever
Youngin' keep that head up
Time to get it now or never, we gone

(Yeah, yeah, this real bad)

[Verse 1: Black Milk]
Yeah, yeah
Grime like no other
Shine like no other
You front on 'bout some monies
Then probably get confronted
By some niggas that don't care they probably ride on your mother
Ride, have you scared to come outside you on warning
Watch your back, front, left, right, eyes every corner
Keep your eyes open wide like your life depending on it
What I pen down on this paper is what we thought was normal
Jot a few words to get started
Clear my voice then go record it
This that midnight on that corner rap
Hand close to the pharaoh
On your block Grim Reaper standing in the shadows, waiting (waiting)
Thinking that your life is for the taking (take it, take it)
If them shots go off you might not make it (made it, made it)
To see another day down in that city
Even though he hate it, he still out here living gritty (g-gritty)
He standing at the age of 20
Thinking if them bullets hit me everybody coming with me

(Yeah, just a thought)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Black Milk]
Feeling like a lunatic
Kneeling at the crucifix
Patiently waiting to hear something back
Something from them skies above
They told me when I was young he would come
Come take all these sins away
Come take all my sins today
Yeah that's what them sinners say
So I wait, 'til I hear something back
But in the mean time, in between time
Gotta hustle up a stack
God don't look just turn your back
Gotta get my hands dirty if I want this 100 racks
Keep it one hunned when niggas is cuttin
From nothing to something when niggas wouldn't
Think you will make it and probably shouldn't
But look who made it and look who looking
From the nosebleeds, we on flo' seats
Looking low-key with a gold piece
Getting gold means getting no sleep
'Til you on stage holding trophies

[Hook]
