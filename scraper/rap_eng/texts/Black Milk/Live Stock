[Intro: REMI]
So freaky, freaky, freaky, freak, freaky
So freaky, freaky, freaky, freak, freaky, yeah

[Verse 1: REMI]
Yeah, I'm nothin' but a cheque
Piece of skyrocket in stuck that's got interest
Even for my coffin, a profit, what you expect?
'Cause pockets you finesse like Questlove playin' sets, stand by
We know the ledge
Juice what you came to collect, I'll pay by sweat
Suits what you came here to get, I get respect
Soundin' like old head that's up against old bread
'Cause I am now, and I need my meds to calm me back down
But the [?] there, they got me fucked up
Wrestlin' in my head, ready to smack down
I do know how to act 'round these creeps in the background
Messin' with the kids, tryna burn 'em like bunsen
Fuckin' with their owners
And they run until development stunted
Why the label heads stuntin', smellin' so pungent?
The devil, he talk shit, speakin' legalese in these closets
To deepen the clauses, but my team sportsmen
We don't drop the ball
Know the price of the portion for endorsement

[Chorus: Raiza Biza & REMI]
You're mine, what I been lookin' for
You're mine, what I need, give me what I want
You're mine, what I been lookin' for (Yeah, yeah, mine)
You're mine, what I need, give me what I want

[Verse 2: Raiza Biza]
Yeah, runnin' circles, chasin' figures like a buccaneer
Unaware, tryna pull an okey-doke like puppeteers
Vultures see what people wanna hear like there's a dollar there
Tell you the exposure line and treat you like a volunteer
I'm on my P's and Q's, rap like I ain't eat no food
Swept like I ain't either cool, back for everything we took
Huh, suits lookin' like I play the fool
Independent state of mind, that's the only way I move
Pull up to the middle, six deep and we play it cool
Hear the proposition now, see if it's a win or lose
Hmm, now that shit was on the other foot
Hmm, let me know when that is understood
I never noticed 'cause this shit was right in front of me
They want the juice, they need the cultural currency
But we been settlin' for less than our askin' price
Now we know our worth and that
So you can go and show for that

[Chorus: Raiza Biza & REMI]
You're mine, what I been lookin' for
You're mine, what I need, give me what I want
You're mine, what I been lookin' for
You're mine, what I need, give me what I want
