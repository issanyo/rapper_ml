[Verse One]:
Aye, I keep it G
Sundown, sun up
I'm from the D where we say "doe" after "whatup?"
Say the wrong shit you can get yourself cut up
So listen when your momma say "shut up"
Hell yeah, the whole nigga the city gon' nut up
Cause I'm the baby son
And son finna come up
By the time you hear this I'll be finally 19
I know that's kinda younger than I probably might seem
I just seen things that mature me quick mentally
Never lost a battle so I'm feelin' like it's meant to be
Who is you?
Nigga who is you?
Cause this is me
Breakin' buds up
Then I light 'em up call it Kushmas Tree
Rap is not a job or a hobby it's a gift to me
And I'mma take this time to thank the Lord for what He given me
Cause
He gave me style
He gave me grace
A nice smile
And a baby face
I love my momma, she love me, she call me "baby cakes"
I love my niggas, keep it real, they can't say he fake
I want it now but somehow they tryin' to make me wait
They say I would've been on if it was '88
In year 2010 tell me what it take to win
It's all about who you know and I ain't into makin' friends
Most people kiss ass, but some of us can't
I'm real
Might ass well give a brother a chance
What's up

It's the ambassador bridge

[Verse Two]:
Maybe cause I'm from the D they wanna keep me down
But I'm gonna do it cause the hood wanna see me clown
I'mma pass turkey's out like Nino
Toys for the kids from they hometown hero
We on
The whole city finna reap the benefits
Of the ambassador killin' shit
I'm talkin' 'bout deez nuts, tell 'em get a grip
Yeah, I'm off the wall and baby this is it
I might moonwalk, you better Beat It, I'm Bad
I'm the Smooth Criminal you hear my smooth talk
Nigga what did you thought?
I ain't puttin' in no shit until you show me some shit that you bought
You ain't finna hit me over the head
Talkin' is cool but I prefer to show you instead
As long as you take a seat somewhere close to the front
Then get a good look at the one who don't give a fuck
About any nay sayers
Say it to my face and I promise I'm ready to hit you with plenty hay makers
Who gon' rep the city like you heard I do?
Across the world I'm givin' people a bird's eye view
Of the life of a kid from a city by the bridge
With the name Ambassador on it
I swear I'mma spit till they hate me or they love me
And when my chance come, I'm not passin' up on it
What's up man?

It's the ambassador bridge
So don't look at it the same when you pass it again
