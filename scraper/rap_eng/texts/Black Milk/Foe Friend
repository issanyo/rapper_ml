[Chorus]
I hope you become everything you wanted to be
I hope you seeing anything you wanted to see
Yeah, do anything for some paper
It’s what they say, guess it’s human nature, It’s like
I hope you become everything you wanted to be
I hope you seeing anything you wanted to see
Yeah, do anything for some paper
It’s what they say, guess it’s human nature, It’s like

[Verse 1]
Birds of a feather, since age eleven
Ran around neighborhoods, always seen together
Two best friends grew up, out of innocence
To entering the spots where they had plots to shoot up
Figured out their roles and how to roll out their hussle
One becomes the Boss the other becomes the Muscle
Found a territory to claim, to play the game
But when the money came the cut wasn’t the same
For both, as time’s passing
Eventually, the envy and greed happens
So what happens? Homie that was the Muscle
Thought he could do it better
Brother’s keeper? Nah, friendship already severed
Down to do whatever to get the crown
Boss had a feeling but was like
“Nah, my man’s holding me down”
Until he found himself at a red light, blinded by headlights
Best friend takes other friend’s life

[Chorus]
I hope you become everything you wanted to be
I hope you seeing anything you wanted to see
Yeah, do anything for some paper
It’s what they say, guess it’s human nature, It’s like
I hope you become everything you wanted to be
I hope you seeing anything you wanted to see
Yeah, do anything for some paper
It’s what they say, guess it’s human nature, It’s like

[Verse 2]
Two homegirls, since twelfth grade remained cool
Made sure they was accepted into the same school
Grew up fast, every dude tryna holla
Every dude in class, knew both wouldn’t bother if
Your dollars didn’t add up to a lot of ‘em
Gold chains the aim, if you had the lot of 'em
Probably caught the eyes of both
Until it turned into only one girl catching eyes from most (Why?)
One friend started living a little more lavish
The other friend started feeling a little more savage
Wish she had the same to the point she start flirtin’
With her friend’s man, snuck in like a serpent
Hook, line, and sinker, set a trap now wait
Man being a man, watch him fall for the bait
The former came knockin', dressed in all black
Dude dipped, now she tryna get her best friend back

[Chorus]
I hope you become everything you wanted to be
I hope you seeing anything you wanted to see
Yeah, do anything for some paper
It’s what they say, guess it’s human nature, It’s like
I hope you become everything you wanted to be
I hope you seeing anything you wanted to see
Yeah, do anything for some paper
It’s what they say, guess it’s human nature
