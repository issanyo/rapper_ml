I jot a black thought for the deaf to jam to
Batter the beat to butcher up a verse in this damn booth
I need speed, methamphetamine for a damn boost
Scribbling shit you other niggas not, that's bantu
Currently pissed off, motherfucker I'm passed tense
Sipping black milk, bumping to a Black Lip Bastard
Black and blue
Back in this bitch with a black stanza
Blacking out, bashing the back of the page, I'm black cancer
Spitting that rough and gritty
Alan puffing up the sticky
Tucking spliffs we ain't amongst you bruh, nobody's fucking with me
I got my lungs in a seat
Bumping the beats and scruffing with keys
Spit like I got a fucking disease
Luckily me and the homies got some stuff in the crease
So you better duck when you see Tut pull up the truck with AP
Cuffing the heat and we bucking with ease
Fuck an MC
We hunting for beef
Lines can't even take punches from me
I'm stuffing this leaf



Flow over like a tidal wave getting Mick Jenkins jealous
The way my flow inducing fear inside these-

[Outro]
What did y'all niggas think y'all was getting another verse or something? Like..bruh, I'm working on two projects..fuck outta here
