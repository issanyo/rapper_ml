[Verse 1: Raiza Biza]
Yeah, it took a while to get my head around what karma is
I saw a glimpse of the future and it was ominous
These pigs pull up and pop bullets at cartilage
And empty stares as eyes lose their consciousness
These politicians use the topic but it's obvious
They just hope our voices all remain anonymous
Oh, you know what time it is
Feels like the awakening, they have forsaken
I've got nothing to say to them
I lost too much family, there's no replacing them
Back in '93 and '94, yo, it was crazy then
I was just a baby then, I didn't understand the significance
Protected like a halo by my innocence, I guess I'm lucky in a sense
If I was older, I would have been forced to shoulder
The choice of bein' a rebel, maybe even a soldier
My father told me war is like the venom in a cobra
I replied, "I'd rather have a weapon on my shoulder"
Fight the good fight 'til it's over

[Chorus: Raiza Biza]
They say we gon' see, if we set our people free, yeah
Tell 'em lean on me, this is what it means to me, yeah
They say we gon' see, if we set our people free, yeah
Tell 'em lean on me, this is what it means to me, yeah

[Verse 2: REMI]
Light years and sky ships away from the source
Put my source and the pain inside my daddy's court
Where the family poor and the casualties soar
Where they casually called and finesse you for all you can afford
And more, but tell me you ignore when the
View from the record store that's on my floor
It's running water, and the view from there is extortion
Dead bodies are the norm like you work at the morgue
And what's a free man, Morgan?
Independence was a lie distorted to steal resources
And they're back to the Lords and British man laws
And the Swiss Bank frauds, and yeah, swish, they scored
And that's real, so did I 'cause of where I was born
Before you white boys got the nose to retort
The same clause that taught the diaspora
The same laws that fought to keep Indigenous folk in the corner

[Chorus: Raiza Biza]
Yeah, they say we gon' see, if we set our people free, yeah
Tell 'em lean on me, this is what it means to me, yeah
They say we gon' see, if we set our people free, yeah
Tell 'em lean on me, this is what it means to me, yeah

[Verse 3: Black Milk]
Yeah, time tells, flyin' shells, on that corner dwells where lives fell
Knowin' it wasn't really your fort, how we was livin'
We was all grown to be doomed from the beginning
Some came up, some learned the hard way
Millin' in the hallway, throwin' dice against the wall
Waitin' for them lucky numbers that never come
So the thought to break the law was entertained
They fallin' for it in front of the cameras
Think I care if it's all recorded?
My nigga, that's what the ski mask for, four in the mornin'
Make the younger joint in, he ain't really want it
But that's how we get the next ones ready to fall in this trap
It's like a track, how to psycho lapse across the map
Well, not exactly how I, uh, had my plans
Now I fully understand how we lost in the end
Tried to win, just another soul lost in the wind and, uh
