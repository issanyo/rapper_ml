[Hook] [Sample]:
"Oooh
Do you think your cooler than (nobody)
Nobody, nobody, nobody now"

Give me the high hat groove. This is how it sound when the high hat move

[Verse One]:
I told her, don't be (shy)
Said she never done it but I think she gon' (try)
Wanna get the money then my nigga go (try)
Time's runnin' out better live yo' (life)
Give me the hi hat (try)
Give me the...ayo
Cadillac grills, black shit, that shit
Matter of fact my nigga I'm comin' right back with
Said I wasn't doin' soul samples this time
Till I found this so I guess I (lied)
But yo I really did (try)
Didn't matter cause I only did it one (time)
Back to the hardcore
Black sendin' wack niggas back to the drawing board
I might be the one come get us fo' (life)
Bright as the sun yeah my niggas gon' (ride)
Hot flows and nigga I got those of us on the top fo'
When niggas who got flows delivered
The macho, not so, brah I'm on
The first verse delivered so nigga I'm gone

[Verse Two]:
I told her, don't be (shy)
Said she never done it but I think she gon' (try)
Wanna get the money then my nigga go (try)
Time's runnin' out better live yo' (life)
Give me the hi hat (try)
Give me the...ayo
On top the world, tell me how it feels
On top of a mil, hundred dollar bills
I've been trying to get on top past couple years
Hip hop's done flopped for the past couple years
But that's my opinion, that's just how I'm feelin'
Don't like what I'm hearin' but that's my opinion
Stay light years ahead of these lightweight niggas
Plus my favorite group's not even coming with it
Feelin' like Three Stacks on a Rosa Parks song
Favorite artists came wack, what went wrong?
Tried to give him a chance, but it's like man
Not getting inspired by nobody damn

[Verse Three]:
I told her, don't be (shy)
Said she never done it but I think she gon' (try)
Wanna get the money then my nigga gon' (try)
Time's runnin' out better live yo' (life)
Give me the hi hat (try)
Give me the...ayo
