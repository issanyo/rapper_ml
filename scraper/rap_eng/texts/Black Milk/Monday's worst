It's never too late to get your values straight
Can you believe me, baby?
It's never too late to get your values straight (no, no)
Do you believe me?

Yeah, heater on the dresser, stomach growling
I'm thinkin' how can I make some dollars within the hours?
It's funny how them hunger pain to your rib can
Turn a decent kid into doing a bid
Over stick-ups, nothing come, so screw the consequences
I'll throw this black hoodie on, walk into this kitchen
Grab my keys and my phone, call my mans to see if he's with it
But he didn't pick up, I guess I'm on a solo mission
Times hard, my God, I can't even lie
A nine O five is not what I'm tryna do to survive
I'm thinking while on the hunt
Somebody â€˜bout to stumble out of this club drunk
Without having that chain tucked
'Bout to get that fucking chain took, nigga

Oh, it's never too late to get your values straight
Can you believe me, baby?
Oh, it's never too late to get your values straight (no, no)
Do you believe me?

Yeah, in the club, chain hanging, swinging, wow
Baby moms is sending texts and sending threats like
Where those payments?
On some deadbeat dad shit, I hate you in the worst way
Spend money on rozay, instead of your son's birthday
Mad quick, I told her "hold up, hold up, be there tomorrow"
Then went back up to the bar to get another glass and a bottle
Okay, can't let her ruin my high tonight, not alright
Plus I pulled this chick
With every sip she's looking more and more like the model type
Ayo, lets leave, I take her, reach for my keys
I'm stumbling out the door looking for my car on the street
'Til I see this black-hood warning, staring nigga tryna stick up
Shots go off, I fell victim, damn

It's too late

It's never too late to get your values straight
Can you believe me, baby?
Oh, it's never too late to get your values straight (no, no)
Do you believe me?

It's never too late to get your values straight
Can you believe me?
It's never too late to get your values straight
Can you believe me?
It's never too late to get your values straight
