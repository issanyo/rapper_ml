[Verse 1: Ruste Juxx]
Ayo, who the fuck told him he the nicest MC?
Garbage ass nigga ain't shit to me
I don't pay for pussy, I fuck for free
Gangsta, I am what you pretend to be
From my KC fitted to my Timberland tree
Known to pump bullets in a vigilante
'96 stomping with that BCC
Touring over seas with my nigga Sean P
Last name Flair first V.I.C
Sick flow, deadlier than H.I.V
Not A.I.D. as a R.I.D.O.U.T. Like a KC G
Niggas know I crime I-Z I-T
When they hear that name Juxx, R-U-S-T-E
Homicide is my speciality
We on the bullshit, BK, NYC

[Hook: Ruste Juxx]
Duck Down!
Bodies hit the ground when they hear that sound
Shots from the cannon representing Bucktown
Niggas act up then they getting struck down
Duck Down! Duck Down! Duck Down!
Bodies hit the ground when they hear that sound
Shots from the cannon representing Bucktown
Niggas act up then they getting struck down
Duck Down! Duck Down! Duck Down!

[Verse 2: Ruste Juxx]
Verse two mo sicker like you know nigga
Crime pays motherfucker I don't do low figures
Shoot ho' niggas, 'cause they talk like a bitch
I ain't gonna say shit
I'mma talk with my clip
Rom-pom-pom-pom, Rat-tat-tat-tat
Translate it for 'em Diddy, "take, that"
Snuff niggas Suge Knight height, goodnight niggas
Cornball you don't live that hood life nigga
Stripes, stars and bars
Money, bitches and cars
Nigga this ain't the wire, you watchin' too much of Oz
Blunt ready to smoke
Gun is ready to smoke
My knife ready to poke
My bitch ready to stroke
My nigga's ready to eat, 'cause y'all niggas got fat
Gotta Juxx you to come up with some figures like that
I'm the realest nigga that you've seen thus far
You can tell by the bodies that's found by the law

[Hook: Ruste Juxx]
Duck Down!
Bodies hit the ground when they hear that sound
Shots from the cannon representing Bucktown
Niggas act up then they getting struck down
Duck Down! Duck Down! Duck Down!
Bodies hit the ground when they hear that sound
Shots from the cannon representing Bucktown
Niggas act up then they getting struck down
Duck Down! Duck Down! Duck Down!

[Verse 3: Ruste Juxx]
To the ground like you ducking from a bullet
Or see it in 3D HD when I pull it
When you catch it, another hit record
Sold three mill in a split second
What bitch? check it
Juxx 'bout to wreck it
Brooklyn Zoo give it to ya raw, butt naked
My partners ready to bust
My cannon ready to bust
My clip ready bang
Nobody fucking with us
Call me the grave digger, I'll put you under the earth
From the Glock 19, I put it under your shirt
Ruste Juxx and I don't fuck around
Bang, Bang, Bang
I'd rather buck around

[Hook: Ruste Juxx]
Duck Down!
Bodies hit the ground when they hear that sound
Shots from the cannon representing Bucktown
Niggas act up then they getting struck down
Duck Down! Duck Down! Duck Down!
Bodies hit the ground when they hear that sound
Shots from the cannon representing Bucktown
Niggas act up then they getting struck down
Duck Down! Duck Down! Duck Down!
