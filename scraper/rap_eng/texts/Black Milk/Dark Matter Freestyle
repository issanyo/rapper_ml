[Verse: Bless 1]

As the rain pounds heavy I up in my truck's seat
Sinking into my thoughts till I'm stuck deep
With no plans of navigating out this mental oasis
Embrace it, foggy thoughts give me clearer vision
My elbow folds on the center console
Display alchemy; turning pencil lead into gold
A giant amongst men with potential untold
From stars to tarot cards what's above is below
My mind travels ignoring the pressures of gravity
Witness the inner galaxy where planets collapse
In fact, mental bondage is snapped
Relax, (breathe) open my eyes and I'm back
Start manipulating this brown vessel to rhyme special
These lines wrestle through flesh
Theyâ€™re designed to catch you off guard
Awaken the God particle
Words maneuver, they curve through ya with no obstacles
Warm your skin like the sun or space heaters
Since my Roots my thoughts been as black as the space ether
Glad to meet ya
Through vibrations is how I greet ya
So my presence remains when I leave ya
