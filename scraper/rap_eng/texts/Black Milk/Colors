[Intro]
Settle down class, take your seats
Pull out the manual and turn to chapter three
We about to learn the lesson on color schemes
You ready? Here we go

[Hook]
Okay, kids, today we learn the color schemes
Like purple hearts, black clouds, yellow submarines
Can't go wrong if you listen to the song when it's on
Listen to the song, sing along to the (Colors)

[Verse 1]
Damn, it's fucked up how they found Tune
He was robbed for his gold chain in front of a brown stone
But what's a fellow to do if he not earning one red cent
Or trying to make the green like mixing yellow with blue
Oh no, it's true another black on black cause it's lynch fly
That's what I heard, word get around like the pink eye
Watch out when your enemies sneak by
Wish I could pour white out on these lines before the ink dry

[Hook]
Okay, kids, since now we learning color schemes
From Red Cross, blue shields, yellow submarines
Can't go wrong if you listen to the song when it's on
Listen to the song, sing along to the (Colors)

[Verse 2]
Now there's some that's dead from fighting over breadcrumbs
Feet and head numb, it's a murder, we call it red rum
Got them boys in blue with black jacks locking the new youth
They sell purples through Blackberries with the Blue tooth
Saw this gold digger red bone I knew poising in Black Tail
Another black girl lost inside the world of Black Male
And white collar crime done on the sneak tip
Different from blue collar workers catching the pink slip

[Bridge]
Yo, red, yellow, orange, green, brown, white, black
Pink, purple, grey, blue, now let us bring it right back
Blue, grey, purple, pink, black, white, brown
Green, orange, yellow, red, now let us break it back down to the (Colors)

[Verse 3]
I think it's quite foul while I sip the Grey Goose and orange juice
And twist a white widow in a White Owl
How first you painting the town red beneath the night skies
Now you going to trail telling little white lies
It gives a mother the blues to see drama
Printed in black and white on papers that cover the news
And read some dudes in a white tee was laying in old piss
A victim of a drive-by, they even killed his goldfish

[Hook]
Okay, kids, we done learning color schemes
Using words like white horse, yellow submarine
Can't go wrong if you listen to the song when it's on
Listen to the song, sing along to the
