[Intro: Black Milk]
This is a Black Milk Presentation
Ride with us, this how we do it
T3 my nigga what up family
Elzhi my nigga what up family
Baatin my niggga what Up fam
In a lam-lam we ran so hand me my Grammy

[Verse 1: Black Milk]
No competition, none villain
Throw them hands to the air all flailing to the ceiling
Take a cup then fill it pour out a little liquor
Toast to my nigga Dilla
Still Livin' still reppin' the cause
To put the D on my back like a shirt that I bought
Turn and I walk you see it's all nothing
We money hungry all eat pocket's got big stomachs
Pockets got big money on the grind no sleep
Gotta keep the alarm clock running
Never leave you alone, my squad's not budging'
They all hide from us like camouflage colors

[Hook: Black Milk]
Time, Time for some action
We gon get it back going back son
Tin where you at
I'm Right Here son
Then show these niggas where they got their style from

[Verse 2: Baatin]
(I can't understand a word of this verse)

[Hook: Black Milk]
Time, Time for some action
We gon get it back going back son
El where you at
I'm Right Here Black
Then show these niggas where the rhymes at

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
Put up a hundred grand and think I won't demolish any son of man
I have 'em feeling like a villain when his gun is jammed
You seen death, swing the right, then you lean left
We battle, you swear you seen death in-between breaths
I travel through sound and dance on the melody
No wonder why they hailing me the king of the spelling bee
You just picking up steam
I spit heat, there's no difference than the one used for sticking up teams
There's no escaping the flow from the older jason
Rapping circles around clowns like I'm roller skating
El is a threat and hailed as a vet
Sipping Louie to 13, you just excel to moet
Hand out the window dropping shells on your set
This is murder rap
I live for n get shot off how they turn they caps
Born crazy the children of the corn raised me
In the killer fields (?) with deformed babies
Ladies I'm tearing in, think I'm marrying
Necking in my million dollar dream house with the aquarium
Man listen you a rendition of a hoe in transition, man kissing, never stand pissing

[Hook: Black Milk]
Time, Time for some action
We gon get it back going back son
3 where you at
I'm Right Here son
Then show these niggas where the flow came from

[Verse 4: T3]
The villa fam and yeah, Black's my man
See them little niggas beefing they're got rid of really fast
Think you've heard the best of the Slum? you haven't heard the last
Speaking' of Dilla, me and my niggas holdin' Dilla flags
Dilla's still one of the illest that did it in the past
Menace to niggas whenever niggas' fingers hit the pass
Can't see us, beat us or fleet us I'm running on the tracks
Flowing with it till I finish I'm dong multiple laps
Matter of fact I smack these cats, they ain't scratch
And totally amaze myself I'm spectac-
Ular I spit that raw I go third
Or tray, or anything else except for herb
Y'all did now y'all done let me and my mans merge
It's the villa high puffing the realest of experts
Planning my birth to resurrect like Jesus In church
Rushin the tempo through momento i spill it on the track son

[Hook: Black Milk]
Time, Time for some action
We gon get it back going back son
We the last ones
Don't get mad son
Give it up, it's a wrap
ONE!
