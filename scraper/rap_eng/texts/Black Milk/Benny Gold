Benny Gold , Benny Gold
Thought I told ya
Flow so sick, Might give ya Pneumonia

[Verse 1: Dapper Dave]
Benny Gold up on my head
That native Pocahontas thread
Yeah, listen the old Smiley's dead
So it's pretty safe to say you're gonna lose when you place bets
Ha! and that's good cause I'm a winner
Born rebellious a Sinner
In all sense of the word
I got through life without ever speaking a word
Now I'm speaking these verbs
That'll cut you up quick, and tough
Before i can really give a fuck
Yeah motherfucker I'm the illest kid
I stack meat on lettuce tomato and shit
Buns and the patties
Yeah I'm talking to you fatty
Rhymes so phat ill give you diabetes when you listen at me bitch

[Verse 2: Dapper Dave]
Speaking for the weak
While I'm helping the tough
And kinda like the rap game
Hookers fucked up
But we out here
We out here
Just Tryna fix it all
Trying to get the highest before I fall
I fall, I fall
More like iSummer
The way i got the flowers shivering
And the winter taking cover
I'm just a rap lover
Let's drink a little codeine
I'm just a rap lover
Lets smoke a little green
Either a stupidity or a contradictory
But that's not me
Well not anymore
I used to get fucked up like "The Tales of Sycamore"
Catch me ballin' up in Syracuse with a Cinderella Whore
3o minutes showed her the door
Stood in cold and..

Thought I told ya
Flow so sick, Might give ya Pneumonia

[Verse 3: Dapper Dave]
I go together like fire and ice
Money no Dice
Nikes no Flight
And Hunger no bite
My nighttime potions something like witches brew Alchemy! and non alcoholic gin
If you get it, you got it, and that's good
Life is a river And I'm the Fucking Loch Ness
Nerd kid rapping
More like Hawking on the beat
Never underestimate
Because the people that do probably fucking hate me
Well that's just me a 5 Panel wearing faggot in jeans
According to most
Well FUCK YOU and what you think this is
A rap verse to get a couple more views and shit?
No not me
I'm not a fucking Hype beast
Fuck those Galaxy Foam Nikes
I'm the Maxmoefoe of music
So fuck the lorax and fuck the cat in the hat
Because i riddle-ly rhymin' all the fucking time ya Bitch
