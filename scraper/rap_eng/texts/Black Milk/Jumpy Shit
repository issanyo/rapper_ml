[Verse 1: Chelsea Reject]
Ignorance is bliss, so I'm feeling great
Spectacular spectacle, so I'm feeling based
Lil B, lil' me, stranger to this industry
Hey Mr. Def Jam, he wasn't feeling me
So I got a face lift, taped on my chest some D's
So dope, so coke, you should get a smell of me
Felony, oh sorry thought you was ahead of me
This is killing ya', Melaine
Fiona, I sojourner your persona with this truth
No gimmick, straight lyrics, I be living in this booth
You're forgiven, here's a noose
Anything I spit is true
And this shit is overdue, no need for a witness here
So hangout, have fun, I'll kick the chair
Biting flows, full course meal you're writing yo
My verbs absurd, bars hard, Rikers flow
Asking how I do it, damn, wouldn't you like to know
I got the gift of Midas, everything I touch is gold
Now isn't that unusual, isn't that shit new to you
Rose out of concrete, birth of something beautiful
Cubicles, but you can't ever box me in

[Hook x2]
Work on your flows and your timing
Up in your videos shining
Rocking them conflict diamonds
Rewind what I said and let that shit sink in
Too many rappers rapping, but really they need to be fans

[Verse 2: Keemie]
Nigga hold up, my vocals need to go up
I'm focused, locomotive on this track, never slow up
In case they didn't know us, pardon the introduction
(I am reject)
Keemie
(Don't you eject)
CD, (as I preset)
Easy, this is light work
My mind moving like geysers, your rhymes look like a fire
Put out what you put out, look out for the look outs
Morning's starting now, woke out to drop my book down
Seems cool to be a fool, all they knew is how to lose
In a pool of sharks, nigga, all we really are is food
But I gotta understand, can't everybody be the man
Don't want to sell you false hope, want to keep it hundred grand
So come meet me in Japan
Cause honestly my odyssey defeats the upper hand
Fuck a lottery, my odds will be
Tighter than a sodomy, miss me y'all weep
As I'm clipping off beats
Aging era, raising terror
Live from 51st Street
Now I'm complete

[Hook x2]
