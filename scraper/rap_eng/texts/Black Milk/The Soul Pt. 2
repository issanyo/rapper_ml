[Oswin Benjamin & Radio Host]
Alright man, introduce your song to the world. Let--let everybody know what you--what you're working with
Hey man, what's going on? It is Oswin Benjamin. Shout out to Black Milk, he don't know me, I'm trying to get to know him, but he made this. So this is the "Soul pt. 2", hopefully y'all like it as much as I do

[Intro: Oswin Benjamin (Singing)]
I don't know what you want from me

[Verse 1: Oswin Benjamin (Rapping)]
Yeah, got a knack for rapping
Knapsack rapper, heathen, pastor---gifted
With no center, too much thinking on my selfish shit
Colleagues amputees, see, they fall for anything and never do stand for shit
Got a mental with the potential of seeing a heart that will stand for something
Trying to attack my heart 'till the nigga ran far to the pine box
I'm gon' tell it like it is, no Sanford and Son
Got a foot full of ones, aim for the life, and a path full of guns
With a mind full of mud, pull your mind with a verb and a word every time I'm aligned with the sun
With the mind that's divine that's deprived of the funds too surprised when the checks don't come, uh
How do I remain positive when my talent is bigger than the negative that I withdraw
Hoping I see God, thinking of a way to let my mind recharge
Trying to off me so on this balcony, I'll be Martin to y'all
More often than not, more on than I'm off, more sure than a beach, more faith than a Pope
More dope for your veins, and the name you don't say in vain
Need a shoulder to lean on, my soul feel depletion, I pledge allegiance to God to get rid of the demons
Locked inside of me the faith of legion
I need completion, I need a reason
I need to believe the region of the soil I'm gon' plant my seeds on
Read Ephesians to the kingdom, I know it's not me, but I'm still a dreamer from a long bloodline of leaders
And we believed in ourselves when no one believed us, my God
Protect your self with the Cotex, I'm a pharaoh with these hieroglyphs
Written on your minds like mine can decode that, visual without a Kodak
Niggas dying to be fly for the price for a toe-tag
Stigmata, nigga, hold that, buffer with the flow
Stay polished, this competition dorsal how they hold back, truth
This 100 proof, speaking from the soul, that ain't nothing new
They'll learn everybody that claiming they fuck with you don't fuck with you, and love just a syllable, don't trust 'em
Don't trust me, I don't know why she feels so lucky
'Cause I know me, but I keep me low key, don't judge me
The real me so ugly, if I show you will you still love me?
Will you still love me? Kiss and hug me? Fuck with me or fuck me? Will you still love me?
I don't even know no more, I don't even know no more
'Cause I'm lost, and I don't even know where to go no more
The rain never felt like this, I ain't never been myself like this
I ain't never knelt like this, I ain't never prayed like this
I ain't never smoked like this, I ain't never drank like this
I ain't never sank like this, I ain't never slept like this
I ain't been depressed like this, I ain't been stressed like this
I ain't been cursed like this, I ain't been---never been blessed like this
No funny shit, I ain't never said it with my chest like this
I'm the best man, I did it
No Eli Porter just me and my niggas, God as my witness
So fuck all these hoes, fuck all these bitches

[Outro: Oswin Benjamin]
What's good with your soul? What's good with your spirit?
What's good with your soul? What's good with your spirit? Goes to my soul then I don't get near it
Then I don't get near it
Gone to my soul then I don't get near it
What's good with your soul?
What's good with your spirit?
What's good? What's good?
Can you tell me what's good?
Can you tell me what's good?
Can you tell me what's good?
What's good with your soul?
What's good with your-good with your spirit, good with your soul?
What's good with your-good with your spirit, good with your soul?
What's good with your spirit?
But don't taint your soul
And don't get near it, no
No, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
*snap*
Word, uh
Don't think about it too much
Don't think about it too much
Don't think about it too much
Yeah, snapping, uh
Don't think about it too much

[Oswin Benjamin & Male Radio Host & Female Radio Host]
Shade 45, man
That's a hard record right there
Soulful
I like it. That shit's crazy!
Thank you, man
I'm looking at you like you a alien, or a different dude or something. Who is this guy?! I met him before, but I didn't hear this shit! Crazy, alright pause, stop the music. Can you say some of that really slow. 'Cause it--it was going so fast that--some of it, you know, I won't get it 'till probably the third listen. And I don't have time to do that right now
I need to get it now
I got you
Can you do it slow for me?
Um, I got a knack for rapping. Knapsack rapper, heathen, pastor---I'm gifted, with no center, too much thinking on my selfish shit. Colleagues amputees, see, they fall for anything and never do stand for shit. I got a mental with the potential to see with the heart and to stand for some
