[Intro]
So wake up, set your sights
For the time is right
For your role

[Verse 1]
No one can fuck with me
I feel like if the bitch could walk she will fuck me
Money over everything, under the influence
At ATM's withdrawing from promethazine fluid
I toss at night so I fall asleep sedated
Sometimes I feel like life is so over-rated
And two thing for certain, that's death and taxes
Tryna move forward doing shit ass backwards
Stand up nigga at night on his knees
Pray and sip Arnold Palmers up under palm trees
Hope to die from old age, but chance of that slim
Smoke Newport so that's going on a limb
But with my lights dim, before it be brighter
Than a stateside spotlight on a million lighters
Held by niggas wearing Puffy shiny suits
With some Daft Punk helmets and some mirrors on they boots
I'm uncouth, Eve in the garden, I fucking beg your pardon
We thirsty and starving
Hungry than a motherfucker, mouth dry as hell
Tryna make it in the city where 90% fail

[Verse 2]
Hola, it's solar, poetry polar
Got the game locked in a crowbar
Never ever sober, hot box and no cars
Watch the day pass on prescription pills Zoloft
If I don't have it, nigga I'mma go off
Razor in the coke tryna slice a nigga throat off
Nigga I'm an ogre, rap like oh god
Hitting bitches from the back camera on the tripod
In your bitch iPod, never rocked Izod
But I rock the python, choke it to your life gone
Nigga I'm amazing, no not a mason
You illuminati, nigga I'm Jason
And I stand Adjacent, dawg no replacement
Used to smoke squares roll swishers in the basement
Mama never said shit cuz she felt my pain
Feeling like crying so I wish that it rained
