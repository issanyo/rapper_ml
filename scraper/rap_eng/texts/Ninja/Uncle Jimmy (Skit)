[Max]
I just want to keep you here in my office as my little pet;

[Yo-landi]
OK

[Max]
Feed you, bathe you, comb your pretty hair
You don't have to do anything you don't want to do
You hear me Yolandi?

[Yo-landi]
Mhmm

[Max]
Yeah, don't let anyone around here fuck you around

[Yo-landi]
Kay

[Max]
You need anything, you hear me, if you need anything
Come here to my office, sit right here on my lap and
Tell Uncle Jimmy what you need
I help you the fuck up
You got that?

[Yo-landi]
Yes, Jimmy

[Max]
No, Uncle Jimmy, call me Uncle Jimmy

[Yo-landi]
Yes, Uncle Jimmy
