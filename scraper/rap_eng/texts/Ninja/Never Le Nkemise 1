[Intro]
Never le nkimise
Never le nkimise
Never le nkimise
Le ka zama mara never leloke

[Chorus: Ninja]
I'm indestructible
Gangsta number one
Play now, cry later
The harder they come, the harder they fall! Hosh!
You can't stop me
You can try but you won't survive
Why? 'Cause I'm a motherfuckin' Ninja

Zef side represent
You fucking with the best

[Verse: Ninja + (Yo-Landi)]
Ninja! Die wit kaffir
Ja julle naaiers! Skrik wakker!
(Ten$ion, Ten$ion, T-T-T-T-Ten$ion)
Looks like I'm gonna need my
Matte black Glock nine millimeter
Everyday's like bulletproof vest time
When you rolling through the motherfuckin' zef side
At night we don't stop at the robots
In da day look around 360 degrees like you busting a motherfuckin' doughnut
I'm not even trusting a road block
Our pigs bust caps in the back of your head
Bang! Now you're dead! What you gonna do huh?
Maybe go run tell Zuma (Ha ha ha ha ha ha)
He doesn't give a fuck!
That's why we keep it motherfuckin' gangsta
I'm not scared of you! But you motherfuckin' scared of me
Ja the Ninja has become the enemy

[Chorus: Ninja]
I'm indestructible
Gangsta number one
Play now, cry later
The harder they come, the harder they fall! Hosh!
You can't stop me
You can try but you won't survive
(Why?) 'Cause I'm a motherfuckin' Ninja

[Outro: Ninja]
If you don't like funerals
Don't kick sand in a Ninja's face
