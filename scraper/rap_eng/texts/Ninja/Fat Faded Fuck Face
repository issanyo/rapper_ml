[Intro - Yolandi]
DJ Motherfukin Muggs
Jou ma se poes
Fokken poes
Fokken fat fuck faded naai

[Hook - Ninja]
Fuck, I'm so faded
So motherfuckin' faded
In the morning, I'll be fresh as fuck
But your carrer still be faded
Fat faded fuck faces hate it
How'd you get so jaded?
Sorry you never made it
Your flash in the pan career faded
Your legacy's overrated, your new shit sounds dated
You no longer famous, kids don't know what your name is
Something crawled up your anus
And died, that's why your face is so fucked up
Sour taste in your mouth
Your bitch call me the greatest

[Verse 1 - Yolandi]
These fat fuck bitches always trip on me
First down for me, they flip on me
I told your boy, "Your bitch needs to chill" (Bitch need to chill)
Can't handle when shit gets real
You are a nut-case, you a two-face
You on a paranoid crusade
No one cares 'bout what you say (Sorry)
You trippin', listen to what your crew say
Your life's like a permanent E come down
Everyday's Suicide Tuesday
Me, I'm fresh like baby breath
But your salt breath needs toothpaste
I told your boy, "Your bitch needs to chill" (Bitch need to chill)
I told your boy, "Your bitch needs to chill" (Bitch need to chill)
I told your boy, "Your bitch needs to chill" (Bitch need to chill)
Fake bitch, fuck, keep it real
Fake fat fuck

[Hook - Ninja]
Fuck, I'm so faded
I don't even know what today is
In the morning, I'll be fresh as fuck
Career still be faded
Fat faded fuck faces hate it
How'd you get so jaded?
Sorry you never made it
Your flash in the pan career faded
Your legacy's overrated, your new shit sounds dated
You no longer famous, kids don't know what your name is
Something crawled up your anus
And died, that's why your face is so fucked up
Sour taste in your mouth
Your bitch call me the greatest

[Verse 2 - Yolandi]
Jou ma’s ‘n tikkop
Jou ma, ek sal haar moer
Jou ma sy praat kak
Jou ma is 'n hoer
Jou ma het gifpiel, binne-in haar hol
Jou ma, sy pomp almal binne in die jol
Jou ma, het AIDS
Jou ma het n hoes
Jou ma het proppies
Jou ma se poes

[Verse 3 - Ninja]
How'd you get so fat? How'd you get so whack?
Fuck the fuck off, once you gone whack, you can never go back
Something crawled up your anus and died
That's why your face is so fucked up
Sour taste in your mouth
Your bitch call me the greatest
Fuck, I'm so faded
Someone told you I'm famous
Bitch, don't ask me for a picture
You don't even know what my name is
Motherfuckers testing my patience
Trying to make conversation
Mouth moving but they don't say shit
Get the fuck off my spaceship
I'm on a permanent vacation, blow a kiss to my haters
[?], I'll see you later, masturbaters

[Outro - Yolandi]
