I’ve got a bunch of girlies i can hit up whenever
They’re wild and they’re sexy and they’re cute and they clever
They gimme all their love and affection, yeah, but they never
Give me fuckin' shit, 'cause I'm nice like that
I’m gonna sip my champagne with vagina, yuh

Smells like fish, tastes like chicken

[Verse 2: Ninja and Yo-Landi]
I’m a happy little chef, cooking up a storm
A happy little naked chef, I cook with nothing on
Uh, word to your mum, cooking is the bomb
Nothing like a nice warm cookie in your palm
You know how i feel about you
So ultra baba, I just wanna be around you
You know how I feel inside, too
Because I really, really, really, really like you
Roar! Hear me roar
My motherfuckin' selection is so incredible
White girl, black girl, skinny girl, fat girl, yuh
What a lot of vagina, baby, give me more
Mushy, tushy, gushy, bushy, smells like sushi
Lickity-spit, peanut butter, she know what I want
Check it baby, if you wanna be my number one
Let me know your future plans

[Verse 3: Ninja and Yo-Landi]
Ooh boy, I know you love me
I also know you’re crazy and you wanna be free
And I know you care about me and you feel for me
Plus, I know you're for real and you'd kill for me
Baby, you're so rugged and raw
And you’re sweet, but I like it that you’re fokken hardcore
God bless you, baba, you a dream come true
That’s why i really, really, really, really love you
Girls like to mic check my M.I.C
Go happy, go sucky-fucky for me
Panties hit me in the face, like, wicked
Smells like fish, tastes like chicken!

[Refrain: Ninja]
Oh? Yeah, fuck

[Outro: Yo-Landi]
Cooking is so fun, cooking is so fun
Now it's time to take a break and see what we have done
Ah, it’s ready!
Wait a minute, what we’re doing isn’t cooking at all
