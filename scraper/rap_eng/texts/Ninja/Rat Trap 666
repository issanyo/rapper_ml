Caught up in this fucking rat trap
First they front then they back stab
U keep trying to fuck me
And look you make me change to be ugly
Caught up in this rat trap
First they front then they back stab
Keep trying to fuck me
And look you make me change to be ugly

You used to be my homie
Then you switch like a fucking snitch
Back when we was homies
You told me you and me should both fuck this bitch
Then you switch clique, hook up with that naff clits
Could have hanged with my raw clique
Now when you see me shit’s spastic
Home girl told me that you got a small dick
Then his dwanky model bitch claimed I hit on her
You wish bitch u ain't all that
The only time that I’d hit on you
Is with a motherfucking baseball bat
I got no pussy posse up in my shit
Self-made motherfucker I'm rich
Coz I spit, the illest shit u ever heard in your life bitch!

Caught up in this fucking rat trap
First they front then they back stab
U keep trying to fuck me
And look you make me change to be ugly
Caught up in this rat trap
First they front then they back stab
Keep trying to fuck me
And look you make me change to be ugly


[Yolandi Visser]
You used to be my favourite
Back then I didn’t know you was a fake bitch
U couldn't try to apologize later, save it
U were hit n miss, motherfucker, face it
Yolandi is an anomaly
Told you you don’t wanna fuck with me
If you don’t like my shit unfollow me
I still believe in my dreams, yeah ya know I mean?

I’m caught up in this fucking rat trap
First they front then they back stab
U dwanky right hand bitch got no flavour
Looking at me like a fucking screensaver

[Ninja]
Uh
And you big fat left hand bitch
She bit off more than she could fucking manage
Boy, you stuck in the middle getting damaged
By a siff, soggy, whack bitch sandwich

[Chorus]
Me, I tell it like it is
Mama said “Baby, you should never tell a fib”
You used to think you the fucking shit
My friend, you got no idea who you fucking with
Me, I tell it like it is
Mama said “Baby, you should never tell a fib”
You used to think you the fucking shit
Motherfuckers got no idea who they fucking with

[Ninja]
Ninja’s pure evil
Ninja diss stupid fucking people
Ninja’s fucking famous
Back home my face is always in the papers
National embarrassment
South Africa’s worst nightmare
Omnipresent motherfucking zef god
Everywhere you look I’m right there (Boo)

[Yolandi Visser]
I started this motherfucking zef shit
Yolandi Visser always on that next shit
I’m a fucking rat not a copycat
This happy cats take my style and molest it
Versace all up over my shit
Self-made motherfucker I'm rich
Coz I spit, the illest shit u ever heard in your life bitch!

I’m caught up in this fucking rat trap
First they front then they back stab
U keep trying to fuck me
Now look you make me change to be ugly
I’m caught up in this rat trap
First they front then they back stab
U keep trying to fuck me
Now look you make me change to be ugly

[Chorus]
Me, I tell it like it is
Mama said “Baby, you should never tell a fib”
You used to think you the fucking shit
My friend, you got no idea who you fucking with
Me, I tell it like it is
Mama said “Baby, you should never tell a fib”
You used to think you the fucking shit
Motherfuckers got no idea who they fucking with

Me, I tell it like it is
Mama said “Baby, you should never tell a fib”
You used to think you the fucking shit
My friend, you got no idea who you fucking with
Me, I tell it like it is
Mama said “Baby, you should never tell a fib”
You used to think you the fucking shit
Motherfuckers got no idea who they fucking with
