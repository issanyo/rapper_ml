[Intro]
Made by God

[Pre-Chorus: Yolandi & Ninja]
Even if it's raining, and the wind is blowing
Even if we're far from home, even if it's snowing
I know that our love is pure, our love will protect us
Even if the world turns against us

[Chorus: Yolandi & Ninja]
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
As long as you're with me
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
As long as you're with me

[Break: GOD]
Yo, people of Earth
God is a DJ
And He loves you

[Pre-Chorus: Yolandi & Ninja]
Even if it's raining, and the wind is blowing
Even if we're far from home, even if it's snowing
I know that our love is forever, our love will protect us
Yes, even if the whole wide world turns against us

[Chorus: Yolandi & Ninja]
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
As long as you're with me
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
As long as you're with me

[Pre-Chorus: Yolandi & Ninja]
Even if it's raining, and the wind is blowing
Even if we're far from home, even if it's snowing
I know that our love is pure, our love will protect us
Even if the world turns against us

[Chorus: Yolandi & Ninja]
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
As long as you're with me
I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
As long as you're with me
