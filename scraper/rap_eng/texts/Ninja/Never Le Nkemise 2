South Africa, 2012
We in the future now
Just because the whole world's gone dwanky
Doesn't mean we fucking going to go out like that too
Fuck the system
We have our own system
We make our own rules
We don't answer to no one
That's right, we keep it gangsta
We keep it zef

[Yo-Landi]
We keep it pumping off its moerefokking face

[Ninja]
One time
Vuil-geboosted warrior styles
Yo, DJ Hi-Tek
Gooi rooi, homeboy

Never le nkemise
Never le nkemise
Never le nkemise
Le ka zama mara never leloke
