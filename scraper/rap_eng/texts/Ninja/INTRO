In New York I play Fortnite
Play Fortnite all night
Do you want to fight?
Yeah, you want to fight
Yeah you want to fight
In New York I play Fortnite

You can't use the N word
You're not from the hood
You can't use the N word (Nibba)
Rocket-ride my rocket
Put my fork in the socket
Rocket-ride my rocket
It's a free game, it's a free game
It's a free game, it's a free game
Why do they get paid, why do they get paid
Why do they get paid, why do they get paid
It's a free game, it's a free game
It's a free game, it's a free game
Why do they get paid, why do they get paid
Why do they get paid, why do they get paid

If you don't like Minecraft, then you are gay)
