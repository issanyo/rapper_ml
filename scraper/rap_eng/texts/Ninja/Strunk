[INTRO: YOLANDI]
Ah, love. lovey love love love love love love
Makes you feel so trippy!
Like you're stoned and drunk at the same time
Strunk! 24/7 papa baba

[VERSE 1: NINJA]
You make me feel like every day is Saturday my friend
Go to sleep, wake up it’s Saturday again
I'm a busy man, I'm goin 'round the world
Got me fucked up by this pretty little girl
You know all I really wanna do
Is get on a plane and come and visit you
Fly close to the sun jesus whats going on?

[Chorus]
Oh my god I'm so strunk
Stone drunk. Oh fuck
Help me lord I'm so strunk
Fucked up. Love drunk

[VERSE 2: YOLANDI]
I’m zoning out in my room all alone
Staring at the fucking telephone
Is this for real or are you just playing games?
Haven't heard from you in three whole days
You told me you want me to be your girl
Look into my eyes and promise me the world
Tell me is this really true romance
Or are you just trying to get in my pants?
Party tonight everybody's goin' on tellin' me we gotta go
Just close the door switch off the light leave me alone I don't wanna fucking go
Fuck your pinky promise playboy, first you steal my heart and then you go
And just leave me so desperately lonely

[Chorus]
Oh my god I'm so strunk
Stone drunk. Oh fuck
Help me lord I'm so strunk
Fucked up. Love drunk
Oh my god I'm so strunk
Stone drunk. Oh fuck
Help me lord I'm so strunk
Fucked up. Love drunk

[VERSE 3: NINJA/YOLANDI]
Love lifts you up like an eagle, baby girl
You're so cool, you're so next you're so natural you're so sex
Love fucks you up like an evil angel
You so cool, cool as ice but playboy you tell fucking lies

[Chorus]
Oh my god I'm so strunk
Stone drunk. Oh fuck
Help me lord I'm so strunk
Fucked up. Love drunk
Oh my god I'm so strunk
Stone drunk. Oh fuck
Help me lord I'm so strunk
Fucked up. Love drunk
