[Pre-Chorus: Yo-landi]
We live the life we love
We love the life we live
We live the life we love
We love the life we live
We live the life we love
We love the life we live
Don’t need no one fucking up my shit

[Chorus: Yo-landi]
Okay, bitch
Get the fuck off me
I freak you the fuck out
'Cause I choose to be free
Fuck your rules
Who are you to tell me
What I can and can’t do?
Fuck you bitch, you just wanna be me

[Verse 1: Yo-landi]
I party properly
Nobody fuck with me
Wear what the fuck I like in the streets
Rock pajamas like a G
You’re not the boss of me
Rock 'em, I got no apology
Neill says that I’m an anomaly

[Verse 2: Ninja]
I get money for free
That shit just come to me
People get lost in a trance basking in my mystic company
I spit heavenly shit
Don’t need no bitch telling me shit
If a bitch tryna fuck with me
That bitch better be fit

[Pre-Chorus: Yo-landi & Ninja]
We live the life we love
We love the life we live
Do what I want to do sweetheart, that’s my prerogative
We live the life we love
We love the life we live
Don’t need no one fucking up my shit

[Chorus: Yo-landi]
Okay, bitch
Get the fuck off me
I freak you the fuck out
'Cause I choose to be free
Fuck your rules
Who are you to tell me
What I can and can’t do?
Fuck you bitch, you just wanna be me

[Post-Chorus: Yo-landi]
Fuck your rules
Fuck, fuck your rules
Fuck your rules
Fuck, fuck your rules

[Verse 3: Yo-landi]
Our zef rights get sued, some poofies in the hood
La-di-da-di, yo we party 'til the cops go ‘whoo'
People think I’m interesting, 'cause I have fun and do my own thing
I don't smile, I snarl for the camera, golden tooth go shing

[Verse 4: Ninja]
Some people think I’m insane or they think I’m pain
This is my resting bitch face, there's nothing wrong, okay?
We third world nigga, we try our best, we don’t give a
I’m an African and I’m proud, this is how we get down

[Hook: DJ Hi-Tek]
This is how we get down, this is how we get down
This is how we get, this is how we get, this is how we get down
This is how we get down, this is how we get down
This is how we get, this is how we get, this is how we get down

[Pre-Chorus: Yo-landi & Ninja]
We live the life we love
We love the life we live
We live the life we love
We love the life we live
We live the life we love
We love the life we live
Do what I want to do sweetheart, that’s my prerogative

[Bridge: Yo-landi & Ninja]
Love is strange, love is dark
Love sucks when you've got a broken heart
Love is weird, love ain’t smart
Love can fix a broken heart, make it glow in the dark
Techno heartbeat, techno heartbeat
Tech-tech-tech-tech-techno heartbeat
Techno heartbeat, techno heartbeat
Tech-tech-tech-tech-techno heartbeat

[Verse 1: Yo-landi]
I party properly
Nobody fuck with me
Wear what the fuck I like in the streets
Rock pajamas like a G
You’re not the boss of me
Rock 'em, I got no apology
Neill says that I’m an anomaly

[Chorus: Ninja]
Okay, bitch
Get the fuck off me
I freak you the fuck out
Cause' I choose to be free
Fuck your rules
Who are you to tell me
What I can and can’t do?
Fuck you bitch, you just wanna be me
We third world nigga
Get the fuck off me
I freak you the fuck out
'Cause I choose to be free
Fuck your rules
Who are you to tell me
What I can and can’t do?
Fuck you bitch, you just wanna be me

[Outro]
Fuck your rules
Fuck, fuck your rules
Fuck your rules
Fuck, fuck your rules
Fuck your rules
Who are you to tell me
What I can and can’t do?
Fuck you bitch, you just wanna be me
