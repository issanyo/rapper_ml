If there's one thing you should know
Now before I disappear
If there's one thing you should know
Gotta say loud and clear

If there's one thing you should know
How I came so close before
'Cause I tried to keep it in
But I can't anymore

[Instrumental Break]

And before I say my words
I got something to explain
No I don't expect a thing
Or that you feel the same

If there's one thing you should know
Didn't ask to feel these things
No beginning, no between
Just an end to begin

If there's one thing you should know
'Cause it's tearing me apart
If there's one thing you should know
It was you from the start

Ooh, summer, ooh
Summer, ooh
Summer, ooh
Summer, ooh
Ooh
