[Intro: Dita von Teese]
Yeah, I know, she's so hot right now
But look out for that one
She'll fuck up your whole life with that little Gucci coochie

[Verse 1: Yolandi]
Ooh ah
She grab the mic and go 'da da da da da dan' here I come
She like to shake her bum to the drum
She a wild one, a young hooligan
Yo, she role with the fucking real ass clique
Yeah, she like that, that he took my chick
She hear cool beat and go, "Yo, that's sick"
She step in the place they go, "Yo, who she?"
She's hookin' it up, she feelin' so Gucci
All up in the place like all eyes on me
She pullin' the place like she high on E
Just leave her alone, why cause she
Just livin' her life, yo, she wild and free

[Pre-Chorus: Yolandi]
She livin' the fast lane, sippin' on champagne
Getting real paid since she livin' in L.A
[?] seem fucking bored
Boy, don't touch what you can't afford

[Chorus: Dita von Teese & (Yolandi)]
She gets everything she wants
She gets everything for free
She will fuck up your whole life
With her little Gucci coochie
(C'mon)
She gets everything she wants
She gets everything for free
She will fuck up your whole life
With her little Gucci coochie
(Oh yeah)

[Verse 2: Yolandi]
Her life is like the wildest dream come true
She do whatever she want and she rap and sing some too
She dance around the club like a psycho little cartoon
Grounding like the elevator, make no worries, smile
The neighbours is jaloers
The neighbours is jaloers, jaloers, jaloers
The neighbours is jaloers, jaloers, jaloers
They peanut butter and jealous
They hate us cause they ain't us
And we rock the mic like this

[Pre-Chorus: Yolandi]
Ya, she livin' the fast lane, sippin' on champagne
Getting real paid since she livin' in L.A
Tippin' the waiter hard, tippin' the valet
Shop the pain away, she having a bad day
She is smokin' hot now with a designer
Gucci, Gucci, yo her little panties on fire
[?] seem fucking bored
Boy, don't touch what you can't afford

[Chorus: Dita von Teese]
She gets everything she wants
She gets everything for free
She will fuck up your whole life
With her little Gucci coochie
(C'mon)
She gets everything she wants
She gets everything for free
She will fuck up your whole life
With her little Gucci coochie

[Verse 3: Ninja & (Dita von Teese)]
Yo girl, I'm tryna fuck that shit up
Gimme some of my fucking G-shit to spit on
Welcome to my life, money, fame
Everywhere I go they scream my mothafuckin' name
They say, "He so nice, he got game"
Little Gucci coochie poppin' like it's champagne
Lights, camera, action, pull a funny face like Cara D
I'm poppin' so these sassy supermodels wanna fuck with me
But some of them are just so fuckin' boring when they start to speak
Ey yo, bro fuck that shit up, rather wank myself to sleep
(I love you, Ninja) I don't care
(I fucking hate you) I don't care
I'm in a jacuzzi chillin' with these black girls in their underwear
Where we sippin' on champagne, my dear
I love it when they braid my hair
I'm so ZEF it's ridiculous
Nuh-uh, you can't sit wif us

[Chorus: Dita von Teese]
She gets everything she wants
She gets everything for free
She will fuck up your whole life
With her little Gucci coochie
(C'mon)
She gets everything she wants
She gets everything for free
She will fuck up your whole life
With her little Gucci coochie
(C'mon)
She gets everything she wants
She gets everything for free
She will fuck up your whole life
With her little Gucci coochie
(Mwah)
