[Intro: Ninja & DJ Hi-Tek]
Yo Hi-Tek, you think you can fuck with something like this?
*Beatboxing*
Yo what you mean, something like this?
Yeah that's perf, Yo-Landi do that thing

[Hook: Yo-Landi]
Hey Fatty Boom Boom
Hit me with the ching-ching
Fat pocket clinking, dollar eye twinkling
Jeez da beats so chunky, me'sa getting funky
Ohh ohhh ohh ohh

[Verse 1: Ninja & Yo-Landi]
When I'm on the mic it's like murder murder murder!
Kill kill kill!
Wat sÃª  Suid-Afrika? Suig my fokken piel
Hier kom ek weer! like a lekker smack in the face (Uh!)
Rappers are fucking boring, Ninja bashing their brains
What happened to all the cool rappers from back in the day?
Nowadays all these rappers sound exactly the same
It's like one big inbred fuck-fest (Sies!)
No, I do not want to stop, collaborate or listen
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy hold on to your ching
I'm taking over Amerika, blowing up everything
Physically fit, the Ninja very energetic
If you haven't got it by now, yo you never gonna get it
I whip my dick out and piss on all this horrible fokken rap
Got a offshore account for the dollar bills that I stack
Yo fuck rap! I'm sorry my china we not related
I cum mad fresh, like the first time I ejaculated

[Hook: Yo-Landi]
Hey Fatty Boom Boom
Hit me with the ching-ching
Fat pocket clinking, dollar eye twinkling
Jeez da beats so chunky, me'sa getting funky
Ohh ohhh ohh ohh
Hey Fatty Boom Boom
Hit me with the ching-ching
Fat pocket clinking, dollar eye twinkling
Jeez da beats so chunky, me'sa getting funky
Ohh ohhh ohh ohh

[Verse 2: Yo-Landi & Ninja]
Hi! My name is...
Yo-Landi fokken Vi$$er! Fight fight fight!
Kick you in the teeth! Hit you on da head with da mic!
There's a rumble in the jungle, I'm bubbling to the beat
I'm not looking for trouble but trouble's looking for me
My pockets are fokken swollen but nothing just come for free
I used to beg, borrow or steal just to hustle something to eat
South Africa used to be too dwankie to notice me
Suddenly you interested 'cause we blowing up overseas
Making money money money! Yes yes yes
Zefside represent! You fuckin' with the best
I'm a upper! Dwankies get popped like a sucker
Baka baka! Yippie ki-yay motherfucker!
I'm a big deal! Yo crazy money get thrown at me
Now I'm having so much fun I can't even go to sleep
Yo-Landi! What?
Where you at? Here I am!
Spitting fokken lyrics like bam bam bam!

[Hook: Yo-Landi]
Hey Fatty Boom Boom
Hit me with the ching-ching
Fat pocket clinking, dollar eye twinkling
Jeez da beats so chunky, me'sa getting funky
Ohh ohhh ohh ohh
Hey Fatty Boom Boom
Hit me with the Ching-ching
Fat pocket clinking, dollar eye twinkling
Jeez da beats so chunky, me'sa getting funky
Ohh ohhh ohh ohh

[Verse 3: Ninja & Yo-Landi]
We keep it lekker lekker lekker, zef zef zef
Spend all my fucking money till there's nothing left
I'm a fat cat, keep the change I don't need a slip
For this fat sack of dagga, yo I'm smoking a spliff
In my matte black Subaru, haters throwing a fit
Round the corner gooi n lekker spif, Tokyo Drift
My daddy told me there's a lot of fish in the sea
There's also a lot of motherfuckin' money, bitches and weed
Ja, dagga dagga dagga! Puff puff puff!
Bring the beat back Hi-Tek!
Make it rough
We drop the type of beats that make you shut the fuck up and dance
We drop the type of beats that got you fuckin' stuck in a trance
In the overseas they like to say you stuck in a trance
We drop the type of beats that make you fuckin' cum in your pants
Uh! Waarsie fokken dagga? Pass it to the left
Lekker Z, to the E, to the motherfuckin' F!

[Hook: Yo-Landi]
Hey Fatty Boom Boom
Hit me with the ching-ching
Fat pocket clinking, dollar eye twinkling
Jeez da beats so chunky, me'sa getting funky
Ohh ohhh ohh ohh
Hey Fatty Boom Boom
Hit me with the ching-ching
Fat pocket clinking, dollar eye twinkling
Jeez da beats so chunky, me'sa getting funky
Ohh ohhh ohh ohh
Hey Fatty Boom Boom
Hit me with the ching-ching
Fat pocket clinking, dollar eye twinkling
Jeez da beats so chunky, me'sa getting funky
Ohh ohhh ohh ohh
