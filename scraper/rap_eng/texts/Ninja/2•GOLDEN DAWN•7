[Intro: Ninja]
I've seen it all
Face carved out of stone, unreadable
Pretty wise and ugly on the skin
Lovely from within

[Chorus: Yo-Landi]
Baby I love you, and my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this material shit for you
If you're sad I cry for you, if I have to I'll die for you
Baby I love you, and my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this material shit for you
If you're sad I cry for you, if I have to I'll die for you

[Verse 1: Ninja]
I am the man, the myth, Ninja dominator (Salut, Ninja!)
Fuckboy come sneak this, bitch
Fuck you, I'm the danger
I do this thing called whatever the fuck I want (dare you to look)
I'll show you that I can if you tell me that I can't
The fucking thunder pound, with the underground
Crack, dope, banana whippin'
One life, two wives, 'cause I fuck it up when I slam
We don't explain, we don't complain, just stick to the fuckin' mission
Set the standard, take the lead, eliminate the competition
I seen it all
When you comin' up and all the motherfuckers wanna see you fall
I don't ever drop the ball, and I'm popping off, so fuck 'em all
I'm on a mission impossible, yo fuckin' unstoppable
Baby, let's rock and roll

[Chorus: Yo-Landi]
Baby I love you, and my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this material shit for you
If you're sad I cry for you, if I have to I'll die for you
Baby I love you, and my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this material shit for you
If you're sad I cry for you, if I have to I'll die for you

[Verse 2: Yo-Landi]
Motherfuckers feelin' my passion, others feelin' my pain
Got a lotta real fucked up shit goin' on in my brain
I walk the ledge and I'm on the edge and I'm really tryna maintain
All I wanna do is bust out and go motherfucking insane
I crush it up and I roll it up and I spark it up and I bam
Yo pump it up, I been comin' up, 'cause I fuck it up when I slam
I'm all about that sick hit, I'm all about that rush
Yo an untouchable, try me bitch, and you're gonna get touched
I seen it all
Been through hell and back, but I beat 'em all
I do this thing called whatever the fuck I want
I'll show you that I can if you tell me that I can't

[Bridge: Ninja]
I'm a zef African American
Big guns, we carry them
Our baby mommas, we marry them
Fake motherfuckers, we bury them
I'm a zef African American
Big guns, we carry them
Our baby mommas, we marry them
Fake motherfuckers, we bury them

[Chorus: Yo-Landi]
Baby I love you, and my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this material shit for you
If you're sad I cry for you, if I have to I'll die for you
Baby I love you, and my love is true
You're my everything, I will do anything for you
I would give up all this material shit for you
If you're sad I cry for you, if I have to I'll die for you
