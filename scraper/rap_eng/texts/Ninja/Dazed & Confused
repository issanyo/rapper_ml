[Intro: Yolandi & Ninja]
Jissus, this is hard shit, aye
Aye, let's go back... let's go to the Caribbean!
Ah, my Ninja!

[Chorus: Yolandi & Ninja]
I miss you, baby love, I'ma see you soon
Fuck it, I've been so busy, spinning 'round in a whirlwind
Can't you just come here? I just wanna be with you
I'm on a mission, but I'm missin' my little girlfriend
It's cool, you gotta do what you gotta do
I'm gonna be there soon, yo, baby, tell me what you want to do
Smoke a fat blunt, and snuggle up inside of you
Oh, motherfuck, there's nothing in the world that I would rather do

[Pre-Chorus: Yolandi]
Zef Gang all around the world, I'm a busy girl
Missing my baby when I'm getting home
Calling Doctor Green Thumb for some medicinal
Weed, fuck going out, I wanna be invisible
Pop a fat blunt in your mouth, there we go
Boy, you illin', chillin' like a villain, feeling all

[Hook: Yolandi]
Dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid
Dazed and confused
Dazed and confused
So dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid
Dazed and confused
Dazed and confused
So dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid

[Verse 2: Ninja]
I'm in the fucking zone, yo, I've been working hard all day
Taking it to the next, yo, I been stepping up my game
Mass murderer, Ninja, he don't play
Got no time for a fuckboy, yo, I'll put him in his grave
We bring it hard, we make it rough
Soon I'm gonna take a break and go visit my baby love
Let's take a break, let's get away
Fuck it, I think Ninja deserves a little holiday
You, me, jump on a plane
I know where we should go, yo, it's gonna be insane
Yo, ask your friends if they wanna go
Tell them I got it covered, I be making fucking dough
Shrooms, bums, fun in the sun
Chillin' like a villain deep in the Caribbean
Sippin' champagne, smoking mad weed
All day, everyday

[Chorus: Yolandi & Ninja]
I miss you, baby love, I'ma see you soon
Fuck it, I've been so busy, spinning 'round in a whirlwind
Can't you just come here? I just wanna be with you
I'm on a mission, but I'm missin' my little girlfriend
Just keep doing what you doing, baby, kill them all
Soon, I'll be illin', chillin' like a villain, feeling all

[Chorus: Yolandi]
Dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid
Dazed and confused
Dazed and confused
So dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid
Dazed and confused
Dazed and confused
So dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid

[Outro]
Oh, my God!
