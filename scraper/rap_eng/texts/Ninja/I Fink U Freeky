Sexy boys

Bad boys

[Hook: Yo-Landi]
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot

[Verse 1: Yo-Landi]
Motherfuckers get buzzed off the spice that I bring
Guess who's got the party jumping?
Glow in the dark rave, aura pumping
It's nice and different, yo fuck the system
My system pumps off its fuckin' face
Step into my world, nou's jy tuis in paradys
Yo word up to my brother Muis
Pomp op jou speakers, yo God se Jesus
Kyk wies rapping lekker to the drum
These bad boys like to smack me on the bum
My crew's blowing up like Chappies bubblegum
Popping in your face now
Yo fuck the rat race, my style is rap rave
My crew is kak fresh, so who the fuck cares
What you fuckin' think? I'm the type of chick
Who rolls with spif giftige misfits

[Hook: Yo-Landi]
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot

[Verse 2: Ninja & Yo-Landi]
Hold up!
Woah woah woah! Wait a minute-minute-minute! Jesus Christ
Yo my man, DJ Hi-Tek, shit, this motherfucking beat is nice
Back in the day them dwankies didn't wanna believe in us
Little did they know that they was in for a motherfucking big surprise
Left home locked in my zef zone
Ready for the test yo? What the fuck, I guess so
Hit the overseas, motherfuckin' heads get blown
Get everything for free like Dr. Dre Beats headphones
When I get home, I lounge on my zef throne
Make my mummy happy 'cause I get so paid
Making my money rapping over techno rave
I can take you 'round the world, let's go babe
When I step up and do my thing I put you in a trance
My zef motherfucking clique got it going on
Fuck what you think, I do what I want
I can make a million little motherfuckers jump
Jump motherfucker! Jump motherfucker jump!
Jump motherfucker! Jump motherfucker jump!
Jump motherfucker! Jump motherfucker jump!
Jump motherfucker! Jump motherfucker jump!
Increase the peace, don't wreck the party
And fuck da jol up for everybody
Ek's a laarney, jy's a gam
Want jy lam innie mang, met jou slang in a man

[Hook: Yo-Landi]
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot

[Verse 3: Yo-Landi & Ninja]
Now why you loer en kyk gelyk?
Is ek miskien van goud gemake?
You want to fight? You come tonight!
Ek moer jou sleg! Jy haardloop weg
God se Jesus, we come to party
Pomp your speakers, yo rock your body
In God we trust, you can't fuck with us
We not taking kak! I'd like to say what's up
To my sexy boys, and my fancy boys
And my play boys, and my bad boys
And my pretty boys, and my ugly boys
And my naughty boys
We gonna have a nice time kids

[Hook: Yo-Landi]
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot

[Outro: Yo-Landi]
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
I fink you freaky and I like you a lot
