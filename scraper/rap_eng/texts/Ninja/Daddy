While he spark that blunt
Now come sit here on daddy's lap
And tell daddy what you want

[Pre-Hook: Ninja]
Don't worry about a thing, fuck the world

Make everything okay
Shut the fuck up, be a good girl
And do what daddy say

Wildin' out swimming with the dolphins
Holla at the waiter

Baby girl want an orgasm
Yo baby, where's your ID?
