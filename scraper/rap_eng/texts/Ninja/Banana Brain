[Hook: Yolandi]
Banana brains, you’re the apple of my eye
Stay with me tonight
Cause I'm having the best time of my life
Banana brains, you’re the apple of my eye
Stay with me tonight
Cause I'm having the best time of my life

[Drop: Yolandi]
Made by God

[Verse 1: Ninja]
(Ninji...)
Baby girl, you so fine
So, so fine, you blow my mind
Look at you, coochie coo
Juicy, tushy, gushy, goo
Boobie one, boobie two
Bouncing like a Looney Tune
Booty boomin', cookie juice
Gushin' out your coochie, boo
You're so cute, like Pikachu
Ain't no one so sweet like you
I was sad, then you sneak into
My lonely heart like peek-a-boo
Now every time I think of you not by my side I dry my eyes
I just wanna sing lullabies to my little butterfly

[Hook: Yolandi & Ninja]
Banana brains, you’re the apple of my eye
Stay with me tonight
Cause I'm having the best time of my life
Banana brains, you’re the apple of my eye
Stay with me tonight
Cause I'm having the best time of my life
Turn up!
Banana brains, you’re the apple of my eye
Stay with me tonight
Cause I'm having the best time of my life
Banana brains, you’re the apple of my eye
Stay with me tonight
Cause I'm having the best time of my life

[Bridge: Yolandi]
Baby boy, you so cool
How can I stay mad at you?
I love you and that's the truth
You so silly, you so stupid
You the best
I never want you to stress
Everything gonna be cool
Wait and see
Just hold my hand and stay with me

[Verse 2: Ninja]
B-B-Baby girl, you been there for me
Through thick and thin with cool energy
You cared for me, yeah, defended me
Helped me defeat my e-e-enemies
Life's weird it keeps testing me
No other girl in the world  impressing me
You like Yudu, you voodoo fresh to me
You just wanna be different
Get the best of me
It was meant to be
You were sent to me
You and me got wild destiny
You’re like a little angel won’t ever pressure me
E-e-everything you do is so Zef to me
I love it that you best friends with me
Just wanna treat your heart carefully
Cause everyday I feel blessed to be
The boy chillin' with you right next to me

[Hook: Yolandi]
Banana brains, you’re the apple of my eye
Stay with me tonight
Cause I'm having the best time of my life
Banana brains, you’re the apple of my eye
Stay with me tonight
Cause I'm having the best time of my life

[Refrain]
Stay with me tonight
Stay with me tonight
Stay with me tonight
Cause I'm having the best time of my life
