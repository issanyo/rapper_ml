[Intro: Ninja & Yo-Landi Visser]
Baby's on fire!
Boom!
Boom boom!

[Verse 1: Yo-Landi Visser]
Showtime! Motherfucker, it's on
Apocalypse now, I'm dropping this bomb
You can't fuck with this song
I'll stick to this splif, I'm not klapping this bong
I'm a wild child, I don't wanna go to bed
Uh shit, sorry man, I'm stoned again
Wooh! Now everything's getting so psychedelic
When I'm doos dronk and I forget all my fokken lyrics
Like um... uh... who gives a fuck?
Don't worry 'bout it, just blow a kiss to me
I like danger, romance, and mystery
I'm a lucky ducky, get mad shit for free
I rock more bling than Mr. T
I make it look easy 'cause it is to me
My daddy says it's lekker fokken spif to see
A South African cherrie making history

[Pre-Hook: Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser]
Baby's on fire
She got me going fucking crazy, soos a mal naaier
Oh jirre! God se Jesus!
Baby's on fire
She got me going fucking crazy, soos a mal naaier
Oh jirre! God se Jesus!

[Hook: Ninja]
Baby's on fire
Baby's on fire
Baby's on fire
Baby's on fire

[Verse 2: Yo-Landi Visser]
H-H-H-H-Hi-Tek, drop that four to the floor
I get real paid, what you think I do this for?
My bodyguard help me get to the bar
Neill Blomkamp's making me a movie star
A lot of bad boys wanna piece of me
If you're lucky, boy, I'll let you sneak a peek
My zef style's motherfuckin' freaky-deak
I don't got beef 'cause I don't eat no meat
I'm on some other shit, yo, I know I speak unique
Fuck your whole shit up when I freak the beat
I love it when Kimmy talks sweet to me
C'mon, c'mon, Kimmy, Kimmy, speak to me
I take a trip down memory lane
Like, "Yo, fuck 15 seconds of fame"
I'm a young blood coming up fresh in the game
Yo-Landi Visser, motherfucker, yo remember the name

[Pre-Hook: Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser]
Baby's on fire
She got me going fucking crazy, soos a mal naaier
Oh jirre! God se Jesus!
Baby's on fire
She got me going fucking crazy, soos a mal naaier
Oh jirre! God se Jesus!

[Hook: Ninja]
Baby's on fire
Baby's on fire
Baby's on fire
Baby's on fire

[Bridge: Yo-Landi Visser & Ninja]
Aaah, freak out!
No need to get so deep
Nothing quite like a motherfuckin' techno beat
A techno beat— a techno beat
A techno— a techno— a techno beat
Just say "what's up?", don't try to get so deep
You know me, maar ek ken jou nie
Ek ken jou nie, ek ken jou nie
Ek ken jou— ek ken jou— ek ken jou nie

[Pre-Hook: Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser]
Baby's on fire
Baby's on fire
She got me going fucking crazy, soos a mal naaier
Oh jirre! God se Jesus!
Baby's on fire
She got me going fucking crazy, soos a mal naaier
Oh jirre! God se Jesus!

[Hook: Ninja]
Baby's on fire
Baby's on fire
Baby's on fire
Baby's on fire

[Outro: Ninja & Yo-Landi Visser]
Baby's on fire
Flame on, motherfuckers
