[Intro: Ninja]
O fok! Tjek die kind!
Hey! Hello baby!

[Hook: Ninja]
Hey sexy! Sexy!
Woop! Woop! Woop! Woop!

[Verse 1: Ninja]
I'm so bright my mama call me her son
Where I'm from shit's fucked so I bought me a gun
Our president talks with a fuckin' fork in his tongue
Beats banging in my head so I walk with a bump
In my own zone, my sweet reality
Got fuck-all to do with your bleak reality
In South Africa I'm the boss of the game
In da overseas shit's like fuckin' insane
I'm walking down the street, hot chicks calling my name
It's like I dropped a cap of acid and it's not going away
Since we dropped Zef Side two years ago
Still freak out every motherfucker who hears my flow
I know how to get da dough, know how to spend da dough
Rocking Alexander Wang from head to toe
Yo! Suid Afrika, fok ja!
Ninja's come to save da motherfuckin' day

[Hook: Ninja]
Girl you looking fit!
That body's legit!
Shake what your mama gave you baby!
Woop! Woop! Woop!
Hey sexy! Sexy!
Woop! Woop! Woop!
Hey sexy! Sexy!
Woop! Woop! Woop!

[Verse 2: Yo-Landi Vi$$er & Ninja]
Yo I'm a lazy arse, scruffy hair, outta bed stumbling
Grumbling, "Where's my coffee?!"
Illegal cigarette smoking, mix it up wif da best dope den
Get my head open!
Den I get da freak-mode munchies
I'm so famous that the police don't bust me
"Fok dis Yo-Landi Vi$$er! Can I get your autograph please?"
That's right it's all about me!
I like partying partying partying! Damn!
Ask my man Alexander Wang!
I hang on the zefside of the train tracks
Careful if you come 'round you'll get dat gold chain snatched
Face smashed! Brain bashed! Car jacked!
Oh shit! Brown streaks creeping up your arse crack
Lelik! When we fuck off, we drive fast
Guys ask for my number 'cause I got a nice arse

[Hook: Ninja]
Girl you lookin' fit!
That body's legit!
Shake what your mama gave you baby!
Woop! Woop! Woop!
Hey sexy! Sexy!
Woop! Woop! Woop!
Hey sexy! Sexy!
Woop! Woop! Woop!

[Verse 3: Ninja & Yo-Landi]
"Let's go do some drugs man!"
Uh... no thanks my brudda, Ninja not a...
No game-having, cocaine jamming up my nose
Brain spazzing paranoid motherfucker... nah
I got it going on girl
No longer signed to Into-Coke Records
Dropped them like a sack of bricks tied to my leg
Now I got them wings on my ankles!
Bo-baas boner blowing in da wind!
Arigato good smile! I'm glowing from within
Hip-hop's fucked! It's gone from, "Move bitch! Get out the way!"
All the way to: "When I was thirteen... I took my first drugs"
What the fuck? Jesus Christ!
Help me out, all I want is to be surprised!
C'mon fuck with me baby! Fuck with me baby!
Wat stink meer as a snoek? N fokken snoek se poes
Ons issie antwoord!
"Haha! What's die vraag?"
Kykie... laat ek jou wys maak, hies die vraag:
Ho die fok het n lelike doos soos jy
Uit jou ma se mooi poes gelgly?
You fucking with the ultimate! Try fuck with me!
God knows Ninja party properly!
Drinking all night, pissed in my pants plus my breath stinks!
I'm like a dog with no legs, you'll find me where you left me

[Hook: Ninja]
