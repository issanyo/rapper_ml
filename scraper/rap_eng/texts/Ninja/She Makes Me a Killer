Never make a pretty woman your wife
Never make a pretty woman your wife, why?
You can't trust that funny look in her eye
Never make a pretty woman your wife

How can a angel break my heart?
Life's hard! I'm just trying to play my part
But she keeps pushing me, pushing me, pushing me, pushing me
Yo yo yo yo! ok, let's go

After a lekker zef show there by tings n times
This hot chick steps to me and says, "I dig your rhymes!"
I said, "thanks", you know and played it shmoove
She said, "ninja, can't you sign your name on my boob?"
I said, "no problem, what's your name?" "sophie"
OK, okey dokey!
Waarsie fokken koki?
I wrote 'ninja was here', it looked fuckin ill
Plus I wrote my number and I drew a duk fokken piel
I said, "don't be afraid!", sophie said, "I'm not afraid"
Then sophie came down to cape town for the holiday
I took her to the waterfront, fokken lekker laaney
I got a chip roll, she ordered calamari
Yo we had a nice time plus alot of white wine
Soon it was night time, 300 buck bill
Fine, paid the bill, signed, ass on my mind
Sophie said I was a lucky catch of a guy
300 bucks is not too much to splash for a naai
Took her back my place, mummies watching soapies
Lamming in her stokies, mummy this is sophie
"oh, hi sophie!" boom! boom! boom!
Let's go back to my room, yo this shit's fuckin on
Then sophie said, "I didn't know you live with your mom!"
"this is not what I expected! sorry this is hectic!"
Just gooi me wif a blow-job! "no!" wat?
Oh I understand! let's go maybe naai in the back seat
"what the fuck do you think I am?" I think you fuckin sexy!
"just take me to my hotel!" bitch, call a taxi!
Nou sit ek soos n jagse doos sonder n ereksie!

How can a angel break my heart?
Life's hard! I'm just trying to play my part
But she keeps pushing me, pushing me, pushing me, pushing me!
Pushing and pushing and pushing! pushing and fuckin pushing!

A woman is more dangerous than a loaded pistol
They promise you heaven, give you hell!
My little baby is driving me crazy!

She makes me a killer
She makes me a killer
She makes me a killer
She makes me a killer
She makes me a killer
She makes me a killer
She makes me a killer
She makes me a killer

Never make a pretty woman your wife
Never make a pretty woman your wife
Why?
You can't trust that funny look in her eye
Never make a pretty woman your wife

If you feeling horny put your hands up
Ninja 'bout to kick a little story 'bout miranda
I was out dopping by the purple turtle hanging wif some homies
Skopped one too many dops
Damn I need to go pee!
I'm on my to take a piss and I see this Scopie
She looked just like a coloured angelina jolie
The cherry looked very happy to see me, "mister!"
"aren't you the rapper from the tv?" is ja
I couldn't help staring at those nice tits
Chilling just below them big fat blow job lips
Plus a g-string all up in that salty crack
I said, "shit! I need to piss but I'll be back!"
That night was a fuckin jol, think it was a Thursday
DJ bumped some 50, go shorty it's your birthday
Miranda asked me in when I dropped her back at her place
On the veranda ninja fucked miranda on the first date
And everything was hunky fuckin dory
Then comes the twist to this funky little story
At my next live show
Guess who's in the front row staring at me like a psycho
Miranda's big green hawk eyes
Glued to the ninja like a red beam all night
After the show ninja gets rushed by a bunch of poppies
I tell miranda, here's some money go buy yourself a doppie
So I'm there signing autographs, smoking a doobie
"can I get your autograph?" sure show me your boobies
All of a sudden miranda busts in, making a spectacle!
Grabs me by the nuts and starts breaking my testicles
Jassis! I nearly smacked her cos
Those heavy fuckin claws digging
Into my balls was very fuckin sore!
Eweskielik n hele klomp fokken koppe draai
Miranda says, "tsy! vat jy my vir n fokken naai?"

How can a angel break my heart?
Life's hard! I'm just trying to play my part
But she keeps pushing me, pushing me, pushing me, pushing me!
Pushing and pushing and pushing! pushing and fuckin pushing!

She makes me a killer
She makes me a killer
She makes me a killer
She makes me a killer
She makes me a killer

Jesus christ!
Why do chicks always have to be so fuckin complicated?
Like this one chick, lazaan, was fuckin into me!
Plus she was a virgin!
So this one time me and lazaan was smoking a zol
There by dj hi-tek's crib
When she says to me, "can't we be alone?"
So I took her to hi-tek's room
About to close the door, and drop the bomb
I said, "I got the bong", she said, "I got the herb!"
I told dj hi-tek, "do not disturb!"
Then bada-bada-bing! bada-bada-bomb!
I put the flame on the motherfuckin bong!
Like now the heat is on!
Lazaan told me she wanted me to be the one
I started slow and sexy, yo I'ma getting some
Punani-nani! punani-num-num!
Like bada-bada-bam! bada-bada-boom!
When hi-tek walks in the motherfuckin room!
Like, fuckin blind
There I was giving it to her from behind
I said, "what's the matter bro?"
"dj hi-tek you wanna have a go?"
Lazaan starts having this moerse fuckin freak out!
There I am standing like a doos with my dick out!
She's kicking me! slapping! teeth flaring! swearing!
I thought barny said: 'sharing is caring!'

How can a angel break my heart?
Life's hard! I'm just trying to play my part
But she keeps pushing me, pushing me, pushing me, pushing me!
Pushing and pushing and pushing! pushing and fuckin pushing!

A woman is more dangerous than a loaded pistol
They promise you heaven, give you hell!
My little baby is driving me crazy!

She makes me a killer
She makes me a killer
She makes me a killer
She makes me a killer
She makes me a killer
She makes me a killer
She makes me a killer
