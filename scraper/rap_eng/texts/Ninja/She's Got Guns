[Verse 1]
He checks the ground while she takes the stairs
He got the flex, but she has the flair
He got ego, but she doesn't care
Got a problem honey, go and take it over there

He turns it up, while she brings the noise
He counts a set, while she beats the boys
He takes a chance, while she flips the coin
He flexing, 'cause she didn't come to play with toys

[Pre-Chorus]
Fading, to the back while she bringing the bounce
Don't you know that (she got 'em)
Raising all the bars, make you stay in your house
Don't you know that (she got 'em)
Wasting all your time, 'cause you quit on the ouch
When you know that (she got 'em)
Tasting victory, make a crowd wanna shout
When they see that (she got 'em)

[Chorus]
Pick it up, pick it up
She got guns that make you feel like a flop
Pick it up, pick it up
Here she comes and now you be like, aaah
Work it out, work it out
She got guns that make you feel like a flop
Work it out, work it out
Making runs, you know she just don't stop

[Pre-Chorus]
Fading, to the back while she bringing the bounce
Don't you know that (she got 'em)
Raising all the bars, make you stay in your house
Don't you know that (she got 'em)
Wasting all your time, 'cause you quit on the ouch
When you know that (she got 'em)
Tasting victory, make a crowd wanna shout
When they see that (she got 'em)

[Chorus]
Pick it up, pick it up
She got guns that make you feel like a flop
Pick it up, pick it up
Here she comes and now you be like, aaah
Do it right, do it right
She got guns that make you feel like a flop
Do it right, do it right
Making runs, you know she just don't stop
