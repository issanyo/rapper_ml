[Intro: Lil Boom & Ninja]
Goddamn, my nigga, what's i-what's in that chest, my nigga
(Lil Boom, my mom loves you)
Four bandaids, my nigga?
Goddamn, nothin?
(Lil Boom is complete trash and utter garbage)

[Verse 1: Lil Boom]
Go through a chest and I find a golden scar (oh)
He won't get far cause I got the blue AR (swag)
Got the white tac so it won't do damage (okay)
Snipe at his ass cause I know he camping (okay) (okay)
Pop me 2 minis and then I pop the full (full)
He tryna flank, I'm too quick to build walls (walls)
Pull out game quick but mine's kinda quicker
He got one kill, so he think he Ninja

[Verse 2]
I'm building and panicking, life on the line (woah)
Loot's in the storm and I don't got the time (woah)
Landed at tilted and somehow survived (I did)
This meteor got me just losing my mind
And if I run squads then my boys got my (back)
Wanna fuck bunny cause she hella (thick)
Carrying around all this loot like Saint (Nick)
Meds or the shields, boy you take your pick (swag)

[Outro] [x4]

It doesn't relate to the song but shit (yeah) (yeah)
