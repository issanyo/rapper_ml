[Intro]
Made by God
Black Cats, White Cats
All my Zef Cats, look out
Big dog in the place to be!

[Chorus x6]
Pitbull terrier
I am a pitbull terrier

[Ninja]
Pussy, for bad boy
No pussy, sad boy
You’re making me crazy
Mal in the skull boy
All work and no play
Make Ninja a dull boy
I’m a animal, love me
I kill you, don’t fuck me
Your pitbull, he’s crazy
Baby don’t hate me
I’d never leave your side, fuck that
I need to freak cause I love that
Berzerk shit and I worship
You

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
Black Cats, White Cats
All my Zef Cats, look out
Big dog in the place to be! (Oh)
Big dog in the place to be! (Yo)
Big dog in the place to be!
Big dog make you scream!

[Chorus x4]
Pitbull terrier
I am a pitbull terrier

[Yo-Landi Visser]
B-b-baby, here, boy
Are you crazy? Down boy
Look at your crass face
Why you so serious??
You’re so intense
Maybe why I’m so curious
I’m a lost soul, save me
Emotional, sway me
Touch me, shake me
I’m game, play me
Love me, hate me
Kiss me, date me
Break me, make me
Yours

Fuckin with the ultimate...

[Chorus x4]
Pitbull Terrier
I am a Pitbull Terrier
Fuckin with the ultimate
