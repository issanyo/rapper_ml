[Hook 4x]
I don't need you
I don't need you
You're like see through
I don't see you

[Verse 1: Ninja]
I'm a playa
Folding paper
From the golden acre
To the overseas
Move over please
The overtaker
Hot boude shaker
The fucking answer
The fucking last year
Dit was lekker maar dis nou klaar
You got your pat on the back but you can't fuck with the Roger Ballen of rap

[Pre-Hook: Ninja]
Don't speak to me
Did somebody say something
With the bass pumping
The place jumping

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2: Ninja]
Butt
Fuck all
Exactly
Yo, you nasty (Yeah)
I'm nasty
I've got the ice cream
Cherry yogurt
Yeah you know it
Want a lick of my ice cream
Suck
I'm a lucky ducky
I think you're sucky fucky

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: Ninja]
To all our mense
That been down with us
Since day one
I fucking love you
To all the other ones
With no fucking face
I don't love you
I'm above you ([?])

[Hook 4x]

[Outro: Ninja]
