Ayo, before I start this song man
I just wanna thank y'all for being there for me...

Listen to the lyrics I'm about to spit yo...

Ever been dissed by the entire world all your life?
I have, I've taken my beatings and got right back up
Everyone be thinkin' I'm spitting these rhymes 'cause i wanna get rich, but the truth is we all just wanna express our feelings through any way possible
Yo, i ain't doing this for the money, the fame, the fortune..
I'm doing it cause i can't think of any other way to let these emotions out
And to my family, i know I let all of you down
I apologize for all the shitty mistakes I've made throughout the years

And to my homies, i let y'all down
I never shoulda moved from the best life on earth to be the twat I am today

I'm sorry for letting everyone down
Just take me to the underworld
And let me rot
Dawg my rhymes gonna be hot
All my life hearing the words "you ain't no rapper"
Yeah well to those words i lift up  a finger
Not the ring or the thumb, or the index or pinky, its the one you put up, when you don't give a f*ck

Yo I'm tired man, I just wanna end it all...
I miss my life
But as they say, nobody dies a virgan, life f*cks us all..

I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even if it meant going toe to toe with the world...

Listen I ain't here looking for trouble I'm just another guy walking through
I just wanna live a normal life like all of you
But I'm tired of the fame man, wanna end this fame
This ain't no fair game
Just let me crash on the wall of fame
Homie screw fame, life's just a unfair game
