[Verse 1]
CLS, all black Mercedes
Dippin' through the city, you know I attract them ladies
Lookin' for a good time, yeah hell of a good time
Mostly I'm 'bout my paper, you know I can rhyme
You can tell when a mack's broke, but nope
Nope I ain't tryna be broke so I match broke for dope
And I don't mean that shit in your veins
But you will lean forward if I shit in your brain
You know it, you should get your act together
You and your whole crew get smacked together
Whatever, it's a new choice option
Automatic TECs don't dance when they pop
Stop jockin', get a life
Or get an autograph, you not gettin' it right
You just gettin' 'em tight, boy
I'm so dangerous
Now I got enough money I can aim the fist
And fire, and fire
Put that word out you've become work for hire
Lookin' for your 9, pushin' an '05
Lookin' for your brain, goin' out of your mind
Yeah it's a new day, yeah it's a new time
You got a new chance, now get on the line
Fine

[Interlude]
This a Duck Down session and we what now reppin'
Buckshot, [?], P-Money, what's funny?
It's a red alert

[Verse 2]
Ring the alarm and I came to bomb it
Do the impossible like I'm Obama
All types of problems from broke to rich
Back to broke, back to rich, one hell of a switch
Damn, lookin' at the rap statistics
Sure lucky if you get one lap in this business
All I hear is what happened to his shit
I ain't answered, that is what happened to business
Everybody dropped in today
But the question I ask is who's droppin' the pay?
Better give my money... or you the type to freeload?
Free download, it's all the same shit, I know
Social network
Cause when I put my neck to work you so shall get hurt
Face the facts
You the type to face the book so you face the bat
Crack, crack, it's a whole new habitat
If it ain't Buck, what you rappin' at, boy?

[Outro]
That's a red alert
It's a red alert
It's a red alert
It's a red alert
