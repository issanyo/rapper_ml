[Intro: Buckshot]
Bundy, shut your fucking ass (Yo, man, we just recorded that!).  Yeah.  The fuck?

[Verse 1: Buckshot]
Look inside of the mind and see
Original Heads, check 1, 2, 3
Light ‘em up.  Hawaiian cess bless my mind
Now I kick the rhyme for the nickel nine, take a sip a wine
But E&J’ll make a nigga laid
Figured I stay to the blunts, save the liquor for my nigga Dee
I’ll represent the Original Head, killing
The original dead.  (Booyah!) That’s my nigga Dred
Blowing the spot (Blao!).  Fuck a philly
Five got the Dutch, Buckshot got the Colin Powell
Check my dialect from my diaphragm
You got your nine by your waistline, and
Me and my niggas don’t give a damn. We got
The Bucktown, Boot Camp attitude, kill a man
Timberland make me General
Roughneck wild, big ‘em up now, Bob Marley style
Cheech & Chong style, light-the-bong style—that’s
Light at night, puffing the L by the River Nile
I smoke so much lye, I hallucinate
Ill visions in my head, everybody must dead

[Hook: Buckshot] (x4)
Killing every nigga in sight, killing every
Nigga in sight, killing every nigga in...

[Verse 2: Buckshot]
I wake up in the morning (We puff lye)
I wake up in the evening (We puff lye)
Check the blahzayblah.  I’m feeling the vibe from the rhythm and
The soul.  I pack a twenty-sack and watch a nigga fold
Don’t you hate niggas who make records for bitches?
It’s all about the blunts—fuck them stunts.  Now
What you want is what you get like Mickey Dee
Bitch, bend over, blow me so I can feel a breeze
Giving my enemies time to recollect on
The past, when I bust that ass, bass took your check
Figured I’d get bigger when I lose my beeper
Knocked your head plus knot your dread, all while you’re dead
We be I and I be we ‘cause we be family
Buckshot, 5FT., and Evil Dee
T-to-the-R-E-V and
The M-to-the-E-E-C-H-E
All my niggas in the place to be
Can I get an amen? (Amen!) See, we be...

[Hook: Buckshot] (x4)
Killing every nigga in sight, killing every
Nigga in sight, killing every nigga in...

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
I like the night if you like the night, ma.  I like
The night (Bitch-ass niggas, take flight)
You want your gun?  I got your millimeter, I eat
A sucker duck emcee to smoke blunts by the centimeter
Right away to serve the nigga on a curb
I love my niggas, so my niggas puff herb—now
My niggas, throw your blunts in the air like this
(Like this) Original Crooks never get dissed
If we get dissed, niggas get that to the back
5, where you at? (Right here!)
Another mission to be dissing, and who do I
Be dissing? (Bitches) God, fuck the intermission
It’s about killing the nigga, the one playing
The bigger, the one playing the sucker ducks with a trigger
I feel a bump coming on in the set
(Son parlay on the wreck) Fuck that.  Time to break a neck

[Hook: Buckshot] (x4)
Killing every nigga in sight, killing every
Nigga in sight, killing every nigga in...
