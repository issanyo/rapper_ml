[Verse 1: Buckshot]
Running out of time
You’re running out of lines
Your shit is too simple, use your mind
I rewind time like DeLoreans
Just to bring you back to the spot where they brought me in
All-black trees on the side of the boots
Walk through the room and it’s like Shaka Zu
But I could do incredible
Un-legible when I write, so my head’ll do it
Pysch! I get high all night
So I strap my pen in my hand and ride on the lines like
No stop signs, no yield
Just “No, Buckshot. Yo, chill”
I build empires ‘cause you been fired
I told son, pipe down, you’ve been wired
That’s why I trust a few
And I hope I could trust in you
Yeah, you

[Hook: Dyme-A-Duzin]
No one, no one
I’d be no one without ya
Roll one, smoke one
And blow your stresses out ya
Don’t care bout who they think is cool
Or how these labels move
Cause we do it all for you
For you

[Verse 2: Buckshot]
I never was the type of guy to be selfish
Make excuses for greed or feed helpless
See where my belt is? That’s my waistline
Only time I sag is if my wallet drag -- fine
You could look down or you could look up
Either way, when you look now, you looking at Buck
But see, the “e” with the “o” connected
Little man did it all for dough, he’s so respected
When the game said, oh, forget him, he ain’t gonna last
I hauled ass til your car crashed
Dru Ha went in the stash, unlimited cash
Wrote a check for the next act, he did it and laughed
I did too (Why?) cause I remember days when the crew
Was so poor, niggas couldn’t afford to chew
Now we pull up to your door like, who?
My reply is, I’m BDI and the token is you, yeah you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
We black out, turn the lights off
Teddy Pendergrass, got the stash and your wife go
That’s my guy
Never got signed to a major -- why?
In the end, I gotta get mine from the start
And if I sign and somebody tell me nah, I’mma bark
Little finger, Buck do the same shit to bang through
And my money right
To be frank, too, I’m alright
I’m alight, be a big one
And nobody’s gonna do it like this one, two, three
All the way up to nine
And I split more Dutches than lines
I’m a crime in myself
No help that I fuck with nine
Millimeter, cause this diva’s blowing up your spine
You could feel it like Anita, you fine
I shine, you shine -- this time, I’m talking to you
Yeah, you

[Hook]
