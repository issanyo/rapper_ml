[Verse 1: Little Indian]
Well I was just driving, in my car cruising
Listening to music, looking at the girls, it's amusing
Ignition, turn off the key, I'm on a mission
Dismissing, miracle, lyrical addition
Condition, my brain is pumping hard like a piston
Competition is getting less, I'm the best so listen
You wishing, to run away from my smoke of horror
An hour, is all I need to have you in my power
A flower, one rose, no one knows how it goes
Full of holes; the stage is empty, I'm gonna plenty
Gently, put you in your place, don't try to tempt me
Just three, one little Indian smoking in a tree

[Chorus: Little Indian] (x3)
One little Indian smoking in a tree
R-I-P-P-I-N-G

[Verse 2: Little Indian]
It's the envious taking our competition like diseases
He freezes, coolie man, the one who prays on Jesus
So leave us and turn, a man is done, you better believe us
The crust, is peeling off the mic and startin' to rust
So bust, it's a must I grab the mic and check it
A record, E-man grab your second, and wreck it

[Verse 3: The Foreigner]
Yo it's the Foreigner, that's never boring ya
Slamming to keep you jamming there is no ignoring the
Accent, to wake up the flavor
Español or English, distinguish, this thing-lish I gave ya
Es el latino panameño to be exact
Soy el que vinó, I’m the one that came to get fat
Bringing funk from the Caribbeans
Taking out the payasos, the clowns, and comedians
With my nigga Indian smoking in a tree
R to the, I to the, P the P the I-N-G

[Chorus: Little Indian] (x4)
One little Indian smoking in a tree
R-I-P-P-I-N-G

[Verse 4: Little Indian]
I'm the incredible, animalistic, vocalistic
Put my hands down to the earth, hear the mystic
You missed it
Evaporation disappear like this, quick

[Verse 5: The Foreigner]
My steelo's mad rough like a brillo pad
'Nuff skills talento
Real smooth como el viento
I be the underrated who created the marinated
Funk, some hate it 'cause they wish they were related
But um, who's el niche in charge over here
Niggas disappear when we play what they hear
Yeah, astonishing, niggas be vanishing
Now we finishing even without the Spanish in
And when it's in, just like medicine it'll cure
'Cause I'm managing to keep it pure
Indian, rack it up the count of four: one, two, three, four

[Verse 6: Little Indian]
Devastation, Indians coming down, new creation in the station
You hear my jam pump throughout the nation
Ventilation, it's coming through my nose
Wrinkle your toes
Say your mind blows
Spark your brain and then watch it as it goes
Flows, to another level, burn the devil
I'm the rebel, with the shovel
God is by my side, so peep the treble
Let me take a break and then I celebrate
Escalate, smoke my weed the best 'cause I'mma graduate, great
I feel the vibe, it's live in my session, here's a lesson
Indians bucking down like Smif-n-Wessun
I'm the step-son
My blood is boiling hard, cause an erection
Intersection, I'm living large sitting in a mansion

[Chorus: Little Indian]
One little Indian smoking in a tree
R-I-P-P-I-N-G
