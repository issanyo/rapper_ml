[Intro] [Buckshot talking]
Here we go! B.D.I., Buckshot, Mick Boogie and The Genius
(Tabi) Yeah! We in the spot. What up Mick Boogie?

[Hook] [Peter Bjorn & John] [x2]
I feel it
Can you feel it?
There's something in the air

[Verse One] [Buckshot]
Whoa
B.D.I. back
New plan of attack, I'm seein' y'all slack
I got that
Fuck 'em all when I'm bustin' off
Cause y'all niggas will jump shit and ride dicks soon as Russell call
Buckshot is his own boss
I make my own game, feel my own pain, take my own loss
Yeah, y'all niggas is so lost
So far from really comin' out, you dumbin' out
And what about?
50 spliff's a day
Nowhere to go and ain't got shit to say
Huh, shorty
I'm talkin' to you
Fuck with a broke nigga, keep your heart broke too
Duke
Keep fuckin' with them birds
Watch your money fly away everyday, my word
I serve
Chicks like thirds
And seconds but my weapon will let 'em have hers
Little Buckshots, call 'em .22's
Aimin' at niggas with tight jeans and funny shoes
When I come through, everything stop
I give a fuck if I said it enough, I'm Buckshot

[Hook] [Peter Bjorn & John] [x2]
I feel it
Can you feel it?
There's something in the air

[Verse Two] [Genius/GZA]
Yo
You couldn't strike a match for God, who's stoppin' me?
Shouldn't play with fire
Not know it's properties
I'm at a billion Fahrenheit plus more
But at the surface, a thousand times greater at the core
Transform blunt to ashes and that to dust
Soon as the lighter flashes then the levels adjust
Because
Science of breath
We identify with
Then I studied the lesson
Then enhanced the fly gift
I strike a cord with the vocal
In no time
Recirculate, resonate way beyond the local
Travel with the mic in my hand
I walk with it on scene with a lean like a bike and a stand
100,000 light years
Away from the average
I came in the booth to civilize the savage
These rhymes are fabric so I stretch the elastic
Just another verse to father you bastards {echo}

[Hook] [Peter Bjorn & John] [x2]
I feel it
Can you feel it?
There's something in the air

[Verse Three] [Tabi Bonney]
Give me a call girl
Not the now now
Telephone get you dialed into my world
Profound sound boy, get it right now
Toco Lomay get hype now
Maiiiiiiiine
Flicker of the light bulb
I'm a member of the flight club
Jet setter, airplane mode
Me and your momma caught the same code
Maiiiiine
You my step-son
Let's talk about it on a talk show
There's more promo for me, young
Next time I make sure she keep the door closed
Test me, I'm goin' to your upper torso
On the tour bus, we T. Bonney star dust
Star Burst in my mouth
Awkward
This west African kid got stalkers
Get so sick and tired, kids gettin' nauseous
Uh

[Hook] [Peter Bjorn & John] [x8]
I feel it
Can you feel it?
