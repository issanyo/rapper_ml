[Intro: Rock]
The madness continues...
Nigga, the madness continues...
The madness continues...
Let the madness beginning, again

[Sean Price]
Yo, tree copping, beef and broccoli Timbs
Hacksaw Jim Duggan, I'm thugging, mugging your friends
Masked murdered, I murdered the mask, I blast burners
Pistol whip your face, finally fuck up your furniture (INSANE)
Nigga, I'm trying to tell you (INSANE)
From the G Building to Bellevue (INSANE)
Break fragments on face, will play straight jackets
With eight ratchets, the eight had, who safe? (INSANE)

[Rock]
Hold up, ladies and gentlemen, uh-huh
Niggas, bitches, new jacks, to veterans, uh-huh
Back together again, better than we ever been, let us in
Or I'm gon' crack somebody fucking head open
They say I'm (INSANE) I need medicine, therapy couldn't help the (INSANE)
Especially when my therapist himself is (INSANE)
So I remain a spazmatic, a gat addict
Who won't battle you, but I will take a bat to you!
Bitches (INSANE)

[Hook: Rock]
You want to act all sick in the brain
You all derange, who you think you playing with?
I show you (INSANE)
Crazy, straight retarded, don't make me
Angry, play it and my squad get (INSANE)
Huh? The whole world know it (INSANE)
Uh-huh, we even got your girl going (INSANE)
Insane (INSANE) Insane (INSANE)

[Rock]
Mr. Al Killa Katraz, the Rocky, the half kamikaze
You block me, it's you that's gon' die, not me
Watch me, you prolly learn something, burn something to it
Get your gorillas, goons and your guns, go murk something to it
Stupid, in the crazy house I'm the land lord
The owner, tenant, the janitor, I mop the damn floors
I will have O.D.B. slap the shit out you
Right after I clap the shit out you, I will show you

[Sean Price]
Yo, psychotic schizophrenic, hallucinigetic
Manic depresive, manage to grab the weapon and wet shit
The outcome is cata-calysmic, shatter your district
Rat-a-tat-tat, the gat'll splatter you bitches
In a, matter of minutes, it don't matter who in it
All that, matters I'm winning, what's the matter, you finished?
Ya'll niggas can't rap better than me, Veteran P
Two fools on the scene rocking them leather fatigues, P!

[Hook]

[Rock]
Listen, I'm B REAL, I commit SEN DOG
Plut slugs in MUGGS, I'm INSANE in my memBRANE, gone! (INSANE)
I don't understand what ya'll talking about
Nevermind this four-four, and this raw nigga, I peep (INSANE)
For playing with a G, when he ain't really G, you (INSANE)
If you think you just gon' play crazy with a beast (INSANE)
You be laying in the streets, it's amazing to me, it's (INSANE)
How ya'll be all saying it's me, you fucking snitch

[Sean Price]
I be the loco, smoke mad weed and tote the four-four
Black gat, the total, the mack snapping your photo
Bozos, sweat the garden, the quarter to ocho
Karate snap body somebody inside my dojo
Show Kazuki, show you the money, show me the coochie
I used to fuck groupies, but now I settle for movies
Sean Price, a fucking blackbelt in ca-razy
Don't play me, you be the next rapper that's pushing up daisies, P!

[Hook]
