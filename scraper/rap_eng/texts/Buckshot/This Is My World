[Chorus:]
This is my world
I’m gonna do what I want
Yeah imma do what I want
This is my world
Yea and i’m doing it right
Yeah and i’m getting it right
This is my world
I’m gonna do what I want
Yeah imma do what I want
This is my world
Yea and i’m doing it right
Yeah and i’m getting it right

[Verse 1:] [Buckshot]
Yeah I said all around the world
Everywhere I go
I look up
I see somebody tryna blow
Like what up buck
I could be your next platinum act
That new nigga that’ll bring duck down back
In fact
Me and my whole crew is fast as shit
I spit this because of you and yo man
Damn
All I want is a chance to advance
My advance so I can take a stand on the stand
And know my jet goin’ land
Right in my backyard
Pull off in my car
Wave my hand
So can I get the try bvi
Tell the truth I don’t see why not
So come along

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:] [Steele & Buckshot]
Wwb double c
Worldwide we recognise
As real mcs
To these streets made of matrimony
Masters of ceremony
Never lonely
Friends in high places
That forever owe me
Fuck the fad
Mean good just the same
Entertain insane
Since we enter the stage
Turn the team
Join the passport
I’m the product the transport
Live narcotics
I got it out of the jansport
That’s a metaphor
I meant it’s all mental
Add the instrument to implement
This rhyme to your temple
Inhale
Keep the game plan
Exhale
Check the wing span
Travel through town
Different communities
Then imma still have diplomatic immunity
Ahead of the class
Yo I running from truancy
I live each day like my last
Til god through with me

[Verse 3:] [Buckshot]
What’s better than gettin on huh?
The same conversation
Bout the same shit that’s dead and gone
Born
Shit I know your story by now
Buy a heart
You cost so much
I’d rather by a town
Cause I don’t got time to talk
I take the t off
Add the w and i’m off
Said everytime I open my mouth
Cash come in
True saying
But that don’t mean it’s you that i’m paying
My motivation is the ones that major in i
I mean
We still cool
Vacation in size
So you can slide any time that you want
Yeah its enough green stuff ain’t inside our blunt
So come along

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
P go off
C’mon
Yeah
Brooklyn
Yeah
New new new york
New zealand
They don’t give a fuck what they feeling…
[Adlib to end]
