Out of nowhere, I appear
To some of y’all -- to most of y’all, I’m a pioneer
So when the sky is clear, and I appear ya hear (Big Bang)

Call me baby son, or little Collider
I mix the chemicals together and mix up a cider
I’m from the Big Apple, so when it light up, it’s a (Big Bang)

When I first dropped (when), in 9-3 (what)
A few labels shot (why), they couldn’t sign me
I had to climb these steps, my rep caused a (Big Bang)

One bell to rock, one live nation
Brought in the corporations, and separation caused the (Big Bang)

Right under freeze, thus y’all feel it
Duckdown did it, E1 reveal it as the (Big Bang)

[Verse 3]
They told me keep it simple, so I keep it easy

See, what the streets be, when you see me, you see a (Big Bang)

I’m strictly Beamers, that’s something else
You seeing me ‘cause I’m something else

3 piece suit complement the car
You see the truth, I complement y’all
Yeah, I’m a star, baby pa, but so far from the (Big Bang)

You can get the braider, but don’t get it twisted
I’m the one who made it, you the one who wished it
You’re just wishing you was living it but felt the (Big Bang)
