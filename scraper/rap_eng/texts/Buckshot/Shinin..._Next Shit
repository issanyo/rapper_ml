[Tek]
Yeah yeah, duck down in the house like this
We doin' it like this
On the Bob Marley blunted tip you know what I'm sayin'
Ha original crook style like this, that ol next shit

[Tek]
Blaka! That's my alarm clock a-shot
Empty out the clip, of a hooded kids Glock
Out on a mission, for the green, wit his team
Twistin up buds, puffin on, bloods, I mean
Always red eye wit an evil schemin mind
Pullin off things wit his partners in crime
Not a care in the world, he's seen plenty stiff bodies
Runnin up in spots wit the calico and shotties
Loungin on his strip wit his Timbs and his meth
His right hands man, on his side, to the left
Never leave the joint without packin the burner
Got the street smarts, either kill or be murdered
It's, no relaxin, just taxin
Stoned Is The Way Of The Walk, when you black and
Supportin habits is gettin too hectic
Gotta kick it wit my son about some ol' Next Shit

(talking on phone)

[Steele]
Pressures be buildin in my mind sometimes in ways
That have me countin the many reasons why crime pays
I think about the hustlin games, should I maintain
Or flip and just shift to the fast lane?
We gotta mob, but it takes dough to make bread
We workin wit cement try to make bricks
Time to make a call and get on the ball
(Can't front G cuz we won't be ones to take a fall)
Heads recognize me, so they might supply me
But if they try me, that wouldn't surprise me
But I & I keep eyes open, for those who lie scopin
Me, hopin, we won't survive, whatever
We can do this for worse or for better
Me and my Partner N Crime, is going thru this together
So, knowin we can't avoid all snakes, we gon' do whatever we gotta do
To set this shit straight

[Tek]
And that's word to my bredrin Madman
Give the left hand, in response, say hello to my Timberland
Rack emcees up, and I crack emcees up
Pass the owl, so I can twist these trees up
Boot Camp Clik sink entire loose lips
Snooze while me and my crew do some Next Shit

(talking)

[Steele]
Big up original crooks from the side of the earth
Where you take all your stakes for what it's worth
We represent the hearts of the criminilistic
Flippish, prepare to draw your biscuit
Fucked up before shit, let's get wit the now
Is you down, or is you just gon lamp in the background
If so, let me know, cuz I gotta keep a steady flow
Step to my biz like so
When I show individuals skills on the battle field
Any man fi test, see we out to kill
Cuz each and every soldier holds the name of the Camp
Blue chip on his show, get trampled
Another villain is planned just banned, dead
We take the band and wrap around the head of an
Original dead boy down wit the Devil
Snooze, as me and my crews, move to the next level

[Hook: Buckshot]
