[Verse 1]
Okay, peoples, how do you do?
Better yet how you feel, let's start with you
True, cause I've been waitin' to get at you
Perhaps you, got somethin' else on your brain besides the last two
Bills for real, there's room to build
Construct a new plan get in tune with your skills
Cause
Lately I see niggas is screwed up
It's the nail in your coffin when you can't move up
Do what?
Lazy niggas done like the language
When you got nothin' to hustle why you fuckin' with them strangers?
Ain't it - kinda wild, this kinda child
Who grew up and didn't smile, still see life foul now
You feel like the world's against you
Cause you don't make dollars but you don't make sense, duke
Think about it bring your logical point of view
When you bust them things, ain't no way you're not on the news
Your futureâ€¦

[Hook]
"Must I feel there'll be no future"

[Verse 2]
Okay, now that we spoke, how do we joke?
When still nothing move but the coke
Or crack, the weed, indeed, we all need something to flock to
Or need a new tune to rock to
I got you, put your headphones in Slot 2
This is just the options you're rockin to
It ain't gonna bother you
I know the rest is redundant
Some of your LPs stands for Long Punishment
Discoverin' new ways to work your body
Plus the mind is shakin' like I'm jerking the shotty
I be, probably, the only one that's never grouchy
I show love when my peoples past by me
Yea, fam, what up wit the plan, you see
Two turntables and my mic in my hand, I mean
You can do what you want for the glory
Pop it in and say Buckshot bore me
But in the end you respect me morally
Cause I don't do raps, just facts and stories
Listen
