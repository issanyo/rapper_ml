[Verse 1]
Let’s take a trip
On a ride with beady eye, it’s arrived
I provide your whip, don’t click
Take position in yours, shotgun
If you got a gun, pass it to the guy who’s up front
‘Cause around these parts they don’t bullshit
I keep a full clip in my whip to do a ball-split
Right after I exercise, my finger on the trigger
Who’s next to die?
Anybody next to my ride know that I’m high
When you pull up at the light you see the smoke from the side
Helicopter see the smoke from the sky
Hella copper when you see the Doppler [?]
When you’re looking at that guy, General Buckshot
Classic like a bus stop, you’re just a porkchop
Needing more hip in your hop
When you’re bucking with this pure, rugged, and rough
Real life shit nigga

[Hook]
We make the world go around
Everywhere you go you hear duck down
We make the world go around
Everywhere you go you hear what now
We make the world go around
Everywhere you go you hear Bucktown
We make the world go around
Everywhere you go you get shut down

[Verse 2]
The only thing I’m loving is beats
And the only thing I’m hugging is the streets
Man, I’m in love with their [?]
Hot rides, hot pies, no hot wives
I ain’t into marrying ‘em, I’m into carrying them knives
Big Rambo, so cut up the Sambo
Image of me and my man, so we can live handsome
Man, they the ones that seem lovely and smile
They just want to see me ugly and foul
But now I’m on the rise and my team is also (that’s right)
Boot Camp Clik and [?] fo’ fours
Go major for what, we pay even more
On tour man, I could have a ball [?]
See I sign my own checks, y’all old checks
Old checked, I been had the lock by the necks
So enough respect due to this mall gorilla
The main killer with the rhyme
I keep ‘em open every time

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I wake up, open my eyes up
And in the process I guess I’ll just rise up
A check for my nigga Ruck, a check for my nigga Steel
See what’s good for the day like let’s piff
To the other side, what they smoking up
Then my man’s hot ‘cause on the block cops be rollin’ up
But I ain’t really trying to see the booking
Like just the other day my nigga said “hey,” and I was like “good look”
Brooklyn that D.T. [?], shit Bloomberg you see he invested
Tested in [?], if money is the root of all evil
The tree is now [?]
That’s real, you see that’s why I stay with the movement
Them motherfuckers stuck on stupid
No movement, I do the [?]
Independent records, we move the [?]

[Hook]
