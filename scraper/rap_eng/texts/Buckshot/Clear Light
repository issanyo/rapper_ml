[Verse 1:] [Buckshot]
These niggas be killin
For anybody watching
Saying you getting money
Them niggas broke as a dutch
Everybody spending more than they make
To be famous
You wanna make it big
Then start making payments
You want big money
You want big cars
Got you in the big looks
But not big bars
Brahs shoot broads
Come off at the van
Right before you reach mine
Right after you leave his
Gee whiz, i’m blessed
Because I keep my position like a gps
I know plenty heads are stressed
But I stress facts
Checks is grown
I dress in slacks
Why lie, crazy high
Pays [?]
Put [?] style
My style is fly
Oooh
You can call them business buffs
Hard body and hard bottles
Who is this fuck
Man what?
Yo, yo
It’s going down
Said it’s the reject
Yea, you gonna need this

[Verse 2:] [Chelsea Reject]
Took all the criticism
Don’t even know what you talkin bout
Murder premedidated
Tell the coroner bring the coffins out
Cause ain’t nobody’s career saved
Not even drake’s
Cause you can own it
But I don’t mean nobody can come and take it
And I ain’t saying names just to say shit
Remember
My people came on a slave shit
Not austrians or racists
So fuck that nigga
That’s a run I came through
I had to shoot
Both the Glock and the boothe
And I reloaded the gun
Like my vision
My word I do open
Had to go in for all the masses of people
Deal with masked emotions
So bask in the moment
Because it’ll be over before you know it
It’s the reject they rejected between the opponent
After hand thinking
I’m way too potent (way too potent)
Don’t begin to treat the [?]
The symbol of the mind
Wind and fire
Yup annihilation
Then you beat that back [?]
Why you even bother
Why you even wanna try and rush
Killin my flow
Apocalyptic, no survivors

[Verse 3:] [Buckshot]
Hah
I’m on the road to riches
Fuck you sons of bitches
Daddy warbucks
I fucks with the vicious
[?]
Dimmer week
It’s in my speech
When I peek
Through the window like a swift breeze
Enemies die then
I supply daily
I supply really
Really?
How many niggas who step up to the plate
Nigga pass first base
I’m out the gate
Wait
Barry bonds
Mary barden
Begging
Half a cookie
Rookie
One laning
Listen my mission
Make money
Make moves
Do what I gotta do for my whole crew
Some young
Some old
Some smack dead in the middle of the bullshit sold
Let’s take it to the next higher gear
Vip money
Get money on the next flight

[Outro:]
It’s going down [x3]
[Let’s get it]
