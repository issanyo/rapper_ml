[Intro: Starang Wondah}
New York , word up , check it out
Wanna let y'all know why we here tonight
And all the ladies, for real y'all throw it up
Word up, yo why we came tonight
And all the niggas, for real, word up
This is real yo, why we here tonight
It's on y'all, ayo c'mon, word up
It's on y'all, yo son yo...

[Verse 1: Starang Wondah]
Check this shit out
This year niggas put up or get out
'Fore I put the hit out, have me smack shit out
These bitch ass niggas and make em all spit out
Blood and teeth
Yo what the fuck y'all want beef?
Word up, I roll heavily in my LX470
Pull up at all the spots, make my enemies remember me
I jet from the scene, spliff in the sunset
I get out [?] and I ain't go for my gun yet
Ain't no mystery on how I came to make history
Big up on behalf of all the niggas that was missing me
Ayo they feel the wrath, we laugh on how we devour guys
Shower guys with lead show em where the power lies
Fucking with Starang, you ain't got a pot to piss in
Can't Stand The Rain, just another New Edition
Taped up in the back of my man's Expedition
Got you wishing you wasn't in this position
Now whether you live or not is up to a Henny's say
Go ahead pop shit, you gon' die anyway
Fucked up in the game, you wasn't fucking with lames
Going against Starang is like going against the grains\

[Hook: Starang Wondah (Louieville]]
Yo what's my mother fucking name?
Big Will
(Hennyville
Ayo we shoot to kill and we won't stop until)
A nigga see a mil' with a house on the hills
Livin out in the burbs with a choice of four wheels
(Yo what's my mother fucking name?
Hennyville
Big Will
Shoot to kill
(Ayo we won't stop until)
A nigga see a mil' with a house on the hills
Taking a truckload of bitches back to Brownsville

[Verse 2: Louieville]
It ain't no thang if niggas wanna bang with this
And claim the clips
Bring it on and bring the pits, bring the miss
And watch me walk off with the chip
Grabbing my dick, tell a girl, blow em a kiss
Nigga discreetly
I see you out there Sleepy
Roll you over in the street and not go beep beep
Ville still gunning
Love the look of hundreds
Critic quotes, once again they've out done it
How stunning mouth running niggas act funny
Stay a dumb dummy, we just stay counting money
Blessed be In N-Y
Blow smoke in the sky, till the day I die
Yo I'm a villest
That be my nigga Big Will
If there's a problem, doctor just prescribe some pills
Or be left lumped up, rest in the dump truck
Going against the wrong side, you done fucked up
I put it up for those who close to heart
Wrong moves, get niggas ripped apart

[Hook]

[Outro]
