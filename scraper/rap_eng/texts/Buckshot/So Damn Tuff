[Kurtis Blow "Tough" sample]
TOUGH! (7X)
So why has it got to be so damn TOUGH!

[Sean Price]
Yo, it's the left jab
That have 'em fucked up like a crystal meth lab
Nigga it's the right cross
That'll rattle your brain and drain your life force
Do a lotta things for the chain with the ice cross
Checking papi down the corner, brick and the white soft
That shit wack, gyro meat with the white sauce
I spit pyro, heat all my life, boss
I'm into large cars and hard denim
Ya'll niggas fraud and your dodge, slobbing on large women
I did a small stint in a large prison
Came home rapping, saying it was all God given
Sean is risen, came up the hard way
Mother Gaston and Blake, that's where the God stay
Sing a sad song, like Sade
I will each ya food like this fucker with Andre, P!

[Hook: Buckshot]
You ain't gotta like it, all you gotta do is get low
When the fifth blow
It don't matter if your bladder's all scattered
On the side of the road, you decided to flow
You be like, I hope these muthafuckas bulletproof
If not, I'm show 'em what these bullets do
Cuz, the mack spraying, saying nigga what?

[Ruste Juxx]
I came to the game a vet, O.G. on the set
Hella choppers on deck, why G's in check
Like a Mossberg round when I'm bringing that sound
You muthafuckas now rocking with the king of the crown
I ain't running, I'm gunning with my latin ratcheto
For bricks of that pure pedrico, ask Rico
Faggot niggas talking bout I'm hating on the south
Cuz I'm hating all that wack shit niggas be putting out
Bitch bullshit is bullshit from B.K. to V.A
Have my nigga B.A. bodyslam the D.J
Magnum's striking like the wrath of God
Heltah Skeltah, crash through the math, I'm hard
You know who you Rucking with, y'all niggas can't Rock
Got runningback bullets that ya'll vest can't block
Niggas buzzing the hood, screaming Juxx shit is rough

[Rock]
It's Mr. Monster Mad Rocko
Oscar the Grouch, hop up out the garbage can and pop toast
Reincarnate your ass with the rugers
Michael J. Fox clap ya stupid ass 'back to the future'
You ahead of your time, huh, huh? Watch how you talking
To grown folks, I don't throw fits, I throw folks
You had no idea the dirt I do, you summamabitches
I call a cab and throw you in front of it, I ain't old school
But I'm big Rock, I hit you in the head with a big Glock
And pop it, you gon' stop and drop
Niggas bad, rookie, the guns bust and boogie
You don't move, nigga fill you with heat, in the street
Doing the tweak, wheezing and freezing wishing you could scream
Wire's last episode, you the nigga Cheese
I am past eskimo, cooler than a breeze
Cold meal, they cold still, and make you stupid niggas freeze
