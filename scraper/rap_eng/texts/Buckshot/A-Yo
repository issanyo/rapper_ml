[Hook: Buckshot]
It's like, A-Yoooo
Ya'll know if it ain't about money better get far from me
Like, A-Yoooo
Ya'll know, Ya'll want to get gully cuz it's bout to get ugly
Like, A-Yoooo
My street team's official so lets go
Like, A-Yoooo
Ya'll know how we roll, if you ain't got no love
So let's go

[Verse 1: Tek]
I picked up weight, someone big enough to do it
If I should die tonight, I'd live through my music
I done fed y'all stories when line was thorough
Brooklyn! I'm just biggin' up my burrow
Where fiends live in cribs and we all them squatters
Tight clothes wearing ass niggas, we call shotta's
It's just my rendition, when chefing in the kitchen
Add in ice, to the water, for a hard, rock the [?]ing
And hit a few doo's
So I can kick a few flows
And fuck a few ho's
That's how [?] goes
But it Seems y'all done forgot us come late
Just to remind 718's the great (bitch)

[Verse 2: Steele]
Stand back nigga, the Brooks in here
Only 'cept for this time, it's off the hook this year
They don't know you can't be doing this without no spine
Bout to give you what we held back all this time
Do my shave test on it
And my AIDs test on it
Then my latex on it
Make sense don't it?
Silly ass broads with they games, I can't be stuck with
Family, My money and my vision not to be fucked with
I really don't like you, really can't stand you
Hell naw we ain't laughin' with you, we laughin' at you
When my goon squad get to gettin', we gettin' at you
Ask me how I does it, It's nothing baby it's natural

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
Guess who's back for the title like Mayweather
Buck, with a black duffle bag and a grey sweater
If they ever, think I ain't gon' get it, watch me
If your food in my face I'll leave your plate sloppy
And you got to be out of your mind
If you think I ain't gonna sideline listen in to y'all rhymes, come on
Who else on your label besides you?
Oh word? That's cool, do as I do
First of all, know your retail, what we sell, the wholesale
This one nigga frontin' like you know the game so well
Shit, I ain't got time, I'm on the scale
Everything gotta be weighed and if it's frail then it's gotta bail
I'll sell a hundred thou, you sell a mil
But a get paid of my hundred, you just blunted with your man Will
You can act like you want it if you will
And I can shut shit down
This is Duck Down we cuttin' deals
