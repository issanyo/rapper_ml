Where The Bag At?
Kenny Marcellus ft Buckshot


Kenny Marcellus verse;
Chilled with the older heads was holdin they Glocks down / my Glock in the box now / momma sayin you the man of the house now. / The money comin fast off the product I'm workin late / like fresh I was 11 grew up at a early age./ I seen muthfuckas smoke crack and stole bags of dope / half my whole pack was sold fast seen New flips and toe tags my clip?/ Had to reload that Cause niggas out here tripping my gun's retarded it's still a star I call it Scottie pippen / would've thought I had the sauce the way i had these niggas dippin / bitches call me budden the way I'm switching positions. / I just mind my business I'm Kermit sipping the Lipton - sick of fucking tea / everybody knew since I made bitter sweet / Mickity mickity Mackin / the Feds attackin and slashing to shreds sewin back up with threads I found on a hospital bed / copying styles is a trend / bow to they're knees they commend / like Jesus was here to attend / man they just really depend / on religious through books that were Tooken to badly bend / mind with deception and depth pausing like gasp in a breath / in ready to battle the lyrical asshole / I'm evil and pop in the field like a Snapple / I'm feeling like Castro

Buckshot Chorus;
Where the bag / nigga all we wanna know is where the bag at / all the bullshit u can have that / u got that nigga pass that, facts (Repeat 2x)

Buckshot verse;
When the day turn dark / ya niggas go to work - I'm a work of art bitch/ I made this whole game switch / y'all rappers got signed, I threw up signs to my click / independent - my click put a dent in / niggas thinking they spittin but they venting / that ain't urs u renting / stop paying rent an / now u outside still venting / into ur wip cause u sleep a lot / now u got a wip with a boot / don't sleep on Shot / u little fuck u my son age / I'm a give u lesson an whip u with this one page / something light on the mic cause my money so heavy I played it dark when I write all night they tell me God loosen up pass the bag let me show u how to move with Buck

Buckshot Chorus;
Where the bag / nigga all we wanna know is where the bag at / all the bullshit u can have that / u got that nigga pass that, facts (Repeat 2x)
