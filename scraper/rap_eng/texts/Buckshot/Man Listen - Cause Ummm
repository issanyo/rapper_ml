[Sample]
"I'm laying my cards on the table and if you feel that you're able
To play come play with me
Then I'll give you all ya need"

[Verse One]
Who Got The Props?
Enta Da Stage
From us on the blocks at minimum wage
To ducking them cops when they in a blaze
To burning haze with my niggas for days
It feels great, see the stage, you seeing strays
Is no longer the way
No more oatmeal for real, it's steak and eggs on my plate
Next to Spliff, next to the great
Next to that chick who said I was it for a date
Hey
I remember the sky all grey
Now it's sun in my vehicle when I ride all day
Yes, no more stress aggravating the god
Just, more or less, congratulating the god
I work hard so my squad can eat
My army is Duck Down be the label to got me to palm trees
Feeling the calm breeze, not [?]
Lace with taste of how your girl face [?] freeze

[Hook]
It's a new day
Brand new mission
If you really want to get paid
Man you should listen cause ummm
You said you was riding with them
Now when I mentioned that party you decided to come
I said
Hey!
It's a new day
If you really wanna get paid
Man you should listen cause ummm
You said you was riding with them
Now when I mentioned that party you decided to come

[Verse Two]
I used to see holes in my socks
Now all I see is the top spots
White boy Scott holding my stock
In the morning when I'm holding my cock
Kind of cocky now
Last week, pockets was weak, kind of stocky now
They can't stop me now
They wanna chop me down
Down Timberland I'm hearing is what I'm rearing I smile
Cause a frown mean I'm upside down
And I'm a king doing my thing, you can't touch my crown
Been around for a second, I'm definitely checking
For my niggas who wanna be diesel no question
Yes men
I can sit around and be guessing
For the next meal for real, you still be stressing
With the Yes Men telling me "yes man"
You the shit, do the shit
As long as I'm here, stick to the shit
Now who the kid in the black Mercedes?
Looking at the steak and potatoes, all I need is gravy
Feel like I made it when my waves is spinning
Got me looking in the mirror now-a-days and grinning
Cause I'm winning when I used to losing
My mood went from beef to showing teeth when I'm cruising
Down the way, I burn a pound a day
I used to ask for help, I turn around and say
Hey
Whatever, where ever
Niggas is crazy
You used to drive now you just Driving Miss Daisy
