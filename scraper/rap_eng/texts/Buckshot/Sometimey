What what what what (throw it up, throw it up)
N-Y-C (Come on, word up, word up) Brooklyn
William H., O-G-C (you know who, you know who)

[Starang]
Yo I'ma look up in the sky, tell my whole crew we done it
Push a GS-400, ball up some new hundreds
Word up, throw it in the air like my crew don't care
Vandeveer in here, plus it's a new year
Ah-huh, whether it's the Jordan's, or the Wally's I be sportin
Yo I'ma real nigga, so you know we never get caughtin
Ah-huh, Bitches just like me, for the shit I rock
And grimey niggas try to get me, for the shit I got
If I was them I wouldn't go there, for real it's too much (too much)
Niggas say that my crew is too tough (too tough)
Plus I smoke the black, hangin out wit William H
Town to town, bound to sell a million crates
I know everybody out there got they chance to shine
And I'ma real nigga so I'ma just waitin for mine

(chorus)
[Starang]
Sometimes I be paid
[Top Dog]
Sometimes I be broke
[Starang]
Sometimes I like to drink
[Top Dog]
Sometimes I just smoke
[Starang]
Sometimes it be this
[Top Dog]
Sometimes it be that
[Starang]
Sometimes I rock sleeves
[Top Dog]
Sometimes I rock a hat

[Top Dog]
Sometimes, duckin niggas wit fifty-one shots (pa-poy-poy)
But tonight's the night, the shit don't stop
Smoke pot
Try to front on I, I think not
I rip shops plus get prop from hip-hop
Fools stop, I don't give a fuck call the cops
I put clips in Glocks cock back and bust shots
Who's hot?
Tell my niggas to watch the block
Hold the shit down before they ass get knocked
Peace to my niggas in jail, on lock
We tight like stock and caps and ??
We got niggas hooked just like cocaine rock
Big up to the shorties that be givin me props
Don't front cause you know that the dog is top
And that sound bwoy bureill shit was hot
You could meet me at a show or getting played on the box
Make you run and get my shit before my shit go drop

(chorus)
[Henny Ville]
Sometimes I drive a truck

Sometimes I be wit Starang
[Starang]
Sometimes I be wit you
[Henny]
Sometimes I'm wit a chick
[Starang]
Sometimes I play the crew

[Henny]
Son I rock this shit from here all the way to end of Cali
Bouncin till I find myself in Maui
Hotel room cloudy
Ay yo my niggas do be rowdy
And if anything pop off I say we outy
Won five hundred blunt it into somethin
This big black U-E-S-L-T beats is huntin
Spread the motto I tell my niggas keep it comin
If it wasn't for this shit I bet we be hustlin
Can't be locked in get a job moppin
Blowin up the jack tryin to call Cochran

(chorus)
[Starang]
Sometimes we Duck Down
