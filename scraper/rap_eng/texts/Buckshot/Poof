[Verse 1]
California Dreamin'
But I’m in BK, paranoid and schemin'
I’m back and forth in the streets, all erratic, dog. I need a
Flight. Have my good bitch Labrador retrieve one
The bitch gooney and beautiful, just a bit boujee
Unruly. Basically, she Fish Mooney
Her shit juicy and the bitch loopy. She get groupies
For me. Better make it two seats. Don’t say shit to me
‘Bout bad grammar. Shootin’ the gift, Bad Santa
Green in my jeans/genes like Bruce Banner on that Gamma
A Week in LA, till we skatin' to Atlanta
Go see Hardaway in a Hawks jersey. Laugh at him
(Knicks, bitch)
Then I’m right back at y'all, back to the Boroughs
Back to the ghetto, back to the metal
Like Blacks gettin' harassed by them devil’s
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
To keep it a hundred, I miss it
Do this every couple of months with a different one of my bitches. I’m like

[Chorus:]
(Poof!)
Now you see me, now you don’t
I don’t just walk the streets. I travel the globe, Nigga
Planin' to breeze as we speak
(I’m gone!) But I’ll be back in a week
I’ll be back in a week
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I’ll be back in a week
I’m like A'ight! I’ll be back in a week
Listen!
(I'mma be right back)
I’ll be back in a week
I’m like A'ight! I’ll be back in a week
Listen!

[Verse 2:]
Southern Hospitality
My North Carolina Mama been hollering
She knows I’m tired of the loudness and foul cops following
And she gobble D. Promised to snatch the soul outta me
Shit official as a nigga in a striped shirt wit' a whistle
Shit is great like Scott minus the tissue
I got multiple magazines. I got issues
A bunch a shit I’m tryin' to get through
I might hit you
Maan! I’m of this. I’ll be back in a week
You bitch niggas support each other.  Y'all be backin' the weak
Make me wanna back out the hammer. Get to backin the weak
Give a shorty the biz till the back in her weak
Listen!
My shit bangin' and I bang heataz
Bang a bangin' diva bitch off the pitcher of Sangria
Got a Miami Chick. I switched her name to Mia
She mad I came out there did a show and I ain’t seen her. I’m like…

[Chorus:]
(Poof!)
Now you see me, now you don’t
I don’t just walk the streets. I travel the globe, Nigga
Planin' to breeze as we speak
(I’m gone!) But I’ll be back in a week
I’ll be back in a week
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I’ll be back in a week
I’m like A'ight! I’ll be back in a week
Listen!
(I'mma be right back)
I’ll be back in a week
I’m like A'ight! I’ll be back in a week
Listen!

[Bridge:]
Man listen!
These cruel streets raised me
Either you or me crazy
Be easy ‘fore your man get blammed!
Man I could use a two or three ladies
A cruise to Jamaikey
Or maybe sweet Amsterdam
Maybe go back to California
Colorado they got the legal Marijuana
Go see the homey Tommy Gunn out in Tacoma
Truthfully, I could be gone for a month
But I do have a daughter. I’ll be back in a week

I’ll be back
I promise
Shit
Hardaway came back?

I’ll be back in a week
I’m like A'ight! I’ll be back in a week
Listen!
I’ll be back in a week
I’m like A'ight! I’ll be back in a week
Listen!
