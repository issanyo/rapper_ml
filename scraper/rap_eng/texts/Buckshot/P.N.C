[Intro: Steele]
Before I go to bed, I take a L to the head
Reminisce over words that was once said
By my man, God rest his soul, I was told stand bold
When under pressure, don't fold
To my brother, my nigga Rambo, you know we love ya
I wish you was around, to see us rip through the underground
Smif-n-Wessun dedicate this to my man Sean Grady, the R
One love baby paw

[Verse 1: Tek]
Grab a hold of your heart and visualize as I kick it
A hollow point slug coming out a black biscuit
You inches from death, we round to the corner, coming quick
We meth'd out our minds and just don't give a shit
Goddamn it, gun shots we bust from the clip
Wicked bad boy, stash the burner on my hip
So fill ya oaths and get dead Mr. Buster
Cause we ain't got love for none of y'all motherfuckers
Chief the black bar, hard to do a ride-by
You're too leery to live, but you not wan' die
All these MCs wit your fancy names and gang
I know from the heart, that it not mean a thing
Big up to all the real heads, wit the knuckle game
Rest in peace to all my niggas that was murdered and slain

(talking)

[Verse 2: Steele]
All heads realize (recognize)
Smif-n-Wessun on the rise (you better recognize)
'All' mean each and every individual
Who listen to that voice in ya head when it be kicking truth
The heads that represent around the way
Showing and proving, keeping it moving till they break day
Realize what's before ya eyes
Then see if you see the same real as we
When I say Smif-n-Wessun, this is what I mean
Nothing alive or in dreams could ever come between
Original Clik, roll through the thin
And when shit got thick, we still managed to stick
Doing crimes with Decepticons, up inside of the Times
Helped we at times, to keep our minds organized
So our knees don't bend, for the enemy
Tek and me, crime partners till the end

(talking)

[Verse 3: Steele]
From the heart of where it all started
Bucktown, Boot Camp representing for all the dearly departed
Next, we coming to speak to the real MCs
Cause the weak MCs blow in the breeze
Smif-n-Wessun holds the remedy
Running wit the Boot Camp on the search for the enemy
And if he happens to be amongst we
Fuck this, we bring him to court and serve justice

[Verse 4: Tek]
See me and my Clik got a thing going on
True to the game and the love makes us strong
For everyday trials and tribulations
You try to stop us, get rocked by a nation
See my forefront of soldiers, ready to blow ya
Leave ya back broke and ya body slumped over
The war is on and the stakes is getting high
You kill a man dead if him shit where him lay
It's the code of the streets, when you out wit ya peeps
Bumping on the beat, be on point for the sweeps
Pigs, harass that ass for the drug cash
Armageddon soon come, keep the gun stashed
But in the meanwhile, sess ease the stress
Taking gun shots through the nose, to the chest
Bless the sensi, that get me eerie
And all praises due to all mighty

(talking)

[Outro: Steele]
Before I go to bed, I take a L to the head
Reminisce over words that was once said
By my man, God rest his soul, I was told stand bold
When under pressure, don't fold
To my brother, my nigga Rambo, you know we love ya
I wish you was around, to see us rip through the underground
Smif-n-Wessun dedicate this to my man Sean Grady, the R
One love baby paw
