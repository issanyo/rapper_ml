[Verse 1]
Ladies and Gentlemen, gentlemen, ladies
Like that 2000-and-now Mercedes
Dipping and dodging traffic, they like "That god's still at it"
But my life is hope-a-less, now welcome to my haunted mansion
Cause I pay my dues and I slay my crews
Back then, I strapped in, I'm (ready for a brand new day!)
Something you never seen, puffing that evergreen
High off this world, I got me feeling like another being
Feel like a martian, when I see the margin
And money now, it's funny how back then the kid was starvin'
You got to pardon, I was used to starvin'
My life was hard then, but now it's kinda cool, I got a new apartment
In the hills, from lyrical skills I possess; I suggest
One consisting of shining, one pertaining to rhyming
The other is the way this brother maintain your mind-ing
Plus my label is signing, now you try to define 'em?
How about this: "The finest"
Something for your arthritis, the block you rep is writers
So when you see the BDI, just try this

[Hook]
My dough
My gosh
My flows
My squad
You know who's in charge
Time to bang up my chest
I don't want nothing less but the best
You see how I rep, yep, yep!
(x2)

[Verse 2]
No more hurting for paper, we're berserk with the paper
Just hit the bank up and I'm (ready for a brand new day!)
No more searching for mines, no more nickels and dimes
9th make the beat bounce while I work with the lines
Yea I'm used to the gutter, and I'm used to the Butters
Shit, I get money from the mother
It's not a joke neither, it's not a hope neither
My own pleading for a god, I'm not cult seeders
I got my shit together, you got your shit together?
Well let's split this bread up and just-
Cause I'm tired of the struggle, I rely on the hustle
Quick shower so when I get out I just slide in a bubble
I'm just trying to show you BDI is the bro
You know you can go to when you (ready for a brand new day!)
Cause I'm fresh and so clean, and I'm reppin the team
Nigga, I'm a coach though when I approach the flow
Yo, I got this game down pat, you see that thing in the back?
Ready for a (brand new day!)
Yeah and I got 'em shook, man, yeah Buck is from Brooklyn
Look man, I'm like a captain off the hook, man!
Tilt your shades so your eyes can see
A vision of the last breed, nigga, I am he

[Hook]
