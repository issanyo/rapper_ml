[Nicki Minaj]
Call me Dracula cause all I do is count chips
Your money mini, I ain't talking 'bout the Mouse trick!
These girls running like I just threw the bouquet
They know I'm headed to the top like a toupee
Now all these bums is wondering where I be's at
If you ain't a Barbie, it's none of ya freaking bees wax
These little rappers I can see them in my dash cam
I know they're grouchy like Oscar up out the trash can
I'm on stage, you can sit in the crowd
I be Up in Lear jets, take a left at the cloud (Haha)
I think She need the Heimlich, she's the chokin' kind
She gets no burn, no smoking sign (Yeah!)
Metaphor heaven
So they approve Nicki like my credit score seven
Mac and cheese, six, fried chicken da guts
And I'm killing these bitches
Mike Vickin' it up, YEA!

[Buckshot]
Don't play with Buck, I'm not a video game
I'm so serious
Put so many holes in your brain
You oblivious to the fact you 0, period
Who the ass said, who the ass meant "Yall there he is!"
Look, neck full of high class diamonds
Wrist lookin' like it made a trip to Mohammed
In the Colosseum or Harlem or Canal
You cop jewels by the penny-weight
I go by the pound
Anyways, I go by the sound not by the style
So when you cut my CD you can get outta town
Go outta bounds? I'm blowin the whistle
Referee BDP yall know I'm official
Yall go, I'mma tissue
Yall dudes is shit
You'll go lights out wiped out
Can't outwit me, outsmart me or outfit me
Listen, this my year
I got the arsenal with me
This my year

[Crown Royyal]
Check, the hoodie
Check, the feet so fly I need air traffic control to direct me through the street
Cash, the cheque, I'm fresh
The death like I die is suicide and then I resurrect
Then I do it again
I stress in I got national geographics on my clothes; tune in
Ha, yeah you could try to keep up but I know you're not worth it
I keep enough of these words cos I know they be thirsty
Be swaggin on my leg man what is this? The third day?
Swagger 3000 on my fly, people it's your day
Rock star to rebel, on another level
Gotta give you the scoop with no shovel
Chandelier wrist, check
The best of Crown Royyal
I'm bumpin like bass and Treble
I check these dudes fresh, they just don't last
Guess I gotta take them to swag class, ah

[Joe Budden]
Wanna talk about bars, mine leave it be
Never needed an A&R, mine needed me
The one thing in this world I can't stomach's a fake
You tryna stop what ain't come with a brake
Some of ya'll made a mistake
Some of ya'll been deprived ain't seen the skill
Just got the truck customized, got a meaner grill
Told baby just being real leave or
Get balls in your mouth, I spoke to her like Serena Will
Top back, top cats get a beating
Saying you're the best, should stop it, it's misleading
Cause I might cock back to get even
It's not a wet dream, you just getting shot at while you sleeping
Feeling like the game can't be weaker
It's why, homie rarely do the cameos and features
I'm good with my insanity and fevers
Cause Pac looking from heaven saying "They ain't understand me neither"
Wanna play it ain't worth it
Maybe why I'm feeling like 'Ye, you prolly won an award, but you ain't deserve it
Circa 01 homeboy, he a vet
Leave em deep regrets like they Tila Tequila's neck
You past your prime, I ain't spit ether yet
You need a major, I just need an ethernet
Word on the street I made the OG's be upset
Cause I'm a student of the game, not a teacher's pet
