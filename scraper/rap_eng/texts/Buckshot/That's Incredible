It's about that time, you don't know, boy?
Nigga, it's 3:57 time, almost four
You can holler about all your beef, til ya throat goes sore
But if you don't know Heltah Skeltah, you don't know war
You don't know Alcatraz, and you don't know Sean
And you couldn't know ya days is numbered, you almost gone
So go on, getting your Joe Schmo on, moron
And get your Flo-Jo on, be gone
Niggas is fake, your teams faker, scared to rep without ya
And they spit at ya car scared, trying to jet without ya
That ain't a throwback, your jersey just old, black
Yo, that shit is tore back
You sucka niggas, ain't gon' stunt on G's
Ya'll lucky, I ain't impressed
Know I got my gun on me, murder at the mothery
Cross my heart, hoping you dying
One shot, your whole head red, you Conan O'Brien, bitch

[Hook: Rock w/ Sean Price ad-libs]
We incredible...
We done shit you never do...
We incredible...
We too many steps ahead of you...

[Sean Price]
Alotta muthafuckas get in the booth
Start talking bout shit that they shouldn't like snitching is cute
These rap niggas get on my nerve
I'm bout to slap niggas up, Rock, give me the word (get 'em!)
I'm straight wild and I like drugs
Wanna battle? 8 Mile or the Fight Club
I'm type bugged, need S.S.I
Marijuana, Hennessey, duke, I guess I'm high, listen
I will Rick James your ho and go broke in the city
Me, my wife, your bitch sniffing coke on the titty
Listen, we back in the building
Fuck rap, got a, package of crack for your children
Take it back when I was rapping in Tilden, trying to get us a deal
It's on, now, muthafucka, it's real
It's Sean, now, duke, the Ruck is still my nickname
Heltah Skeltah, bitch, ain't shit change

[Hook]

[Rock]
You niggas can never, never ever, hang, don't try now
Dog, you barely there like Mannie Fresh eyebrows
So pipe down or die now, I ain't battling
Fuck rapping, bring 'em to Sachmen, let gats embarass 'em

[Sean Price]
You can catch me on Bristol and Blake, ripping the eight
Selling blow, smoking 'dro, and the feeling is great
To all my animal lovers, you feeling this ape?
Cop the album, start feeling the tape

[Rock]
Just in case, I'm renaming both of my hands Laxative and Colonic
They ah, smack shit out any nigga who want it
My guns rock and roll but only with 'ink you bust'
You left 'stained' in a 'puddle of mud', cuz you think you tough, I'm a Monster

[Sean Price]
Yo, unleash the piece, and spank you, boy
Bong, release the Beast, I'm Hank McCoy
Used to take 'x man', and show no hoes love
Now I let the skit blam at them so called thugs

[Hook]
