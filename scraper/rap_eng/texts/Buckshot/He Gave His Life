[Intro: Bee Gees' sample]
He gave his life today
He gave his life today

[Verse 1: Tek]
It was a road block, coming to a full stop
Canine, snipers on the rooftop
Yellow tape, orange cones, blue lights
[?] border past midnight
Hospital got my old lady screaming
Red eye, wavy hair, black demon
Tell me, is this what I asked for?
It ain't like a nigga never saw blood before
But he gave his life today
Could've sworn I saw the Heavens open
The world wondering why I gave up smoking
They wondering why I gave up smoking
I seen too many premonitions
From the cradle to the grave of our existence
When one leave, one return in the flesh
When that man took his left, my son took his first breath, so

[Hook: Jahdan & Bee Gees' sample]
He gave his life today
So many youths drop out, living the gangster life, oh
He gave his life today
Trying to live the gangster's paradise
He gave his life today
Whoa, whoa, you got to think about your life seriously
He gave his life today
Freedom or life, locked up in the penitentiary

[Verse 2: Steele & Bee Gees' sample]
Yo, I wrote a song for the soldiers in the trenches
It's a long way from home, stay strong on your mission
Since you're gone, not much been different
Pop proud, mom misses, sent a letter with a picture
I ain't there with ya, but I'm there with ya
Take care, mister, we still here with ya 'cause we care, nigga
Over there similar to over here
Be prepared, nigga, God forbid, these the words I hear, nigga
He gave his life today
That'll make pop crazy, have mama screaming "Not my baby"
The good die young, that's what they saying
In the hood where I'm from, that's an understatement
Call it The Matrix, where rodents and snakes live
The world of hatred, we go on to make it
We make sure 'fore we leave this game
That Boot Camp Clik name associated with greatness

[Hook: Jahdan & Bee Gees' sample]
He gave his life today
Yo, so many youths drop out, living the gangster life, oh yeah, uh
He gave his life today
Trying to live the gangster's paradise, yeah
He gave his life today
Think about your life seriously, freedom or life, in the penitentiary
He gave his life today
Try to live the gangster's paradise

[Verse 3: Louieville Sluggah & Bee Gees' sample]
I should be grateful and thankful for what I have
'Cause some don't even have half of what I have
They say "Henny on some shit"
Won't let near niggas slide 'cause that's how my homie died
They took his kindness for a weakness
And over the weekend, they left my boy sleeping
That's why I can't play with ya
'Cause if you cross me over shit, I'ma let them things hit ya
He gave his life today
He was a good dude, good son, good father to his seed
Told 'em "Be all you wanna be"
Word up, I miss my road dog
You know, grinding, shining, shopping and club hopping
Whatever the bank was, my boy stopped it
A quick 4,5,6 and then it's in the pocket
My boy was too raw, R.I.P. Rude Dog

[Hook: Jahdan & Bee Gees' sample]
He gave his life today
Uh, so many youths drop out, living the gangster life, oh yeah
He gave his life today
Trying to live the gangster's paradise
He gave his life today
Think about your life seriously, freedom or life, in the penitentiary
He gave his life today
Try to live the gangster's paradise

[Verse 4: Buckshot & Bee Gees' sample]
Look at your boy now, he trying to come up
Think he grown 'cause he can curse and roll up
Hold up, I know that ain't a pistol shorty
You barely a teen, what you mean you rip through shorty?
And who said it was corny to be cool
Better then be a savage, or you rather be that fool?
The facts prove that that move is not smooth
I got niggas pushing flowers like that, who knew
He gave his life today
Hmm, and if he would've thought smarter
He might've been able to start a
Family, damn a D fall for the same thing
So I keep you dry in the rain
No shame will remain, there's so many things in the game
That'll mess with your brain, so maintain
'Cause, I knew a shorty your age
Thirteen, shot by a thirty-year-old gauge, and...

[Hook: Jahdan & Bee Gees' sample]
He gave his life today
Huh, so many youths drop out, living the gangster life, oh, oh
He gave his life today
Uh, trying to live the gangster's paradise, yeah
He gave his life today
Think about your life seriously, freedom or life, in the penitentiary
He gave his life today
Locked away for a century, yeah, hey yeah

[Outro: Jahdan]
So many youths drop out, living the gangster life
Trying to live the gangster's paradise
Think about your life seriously, freedom or life, in the penitentiary
Send him a lord with the red and the blue
And there be a wicked man holding down your crew
You don't know what they will or won't do
Now the gun banging at you, yeah
He gave his life today
So many youths drop out, living the gangster life
Trying to live the gangster's paradise
Think about your life seriously, freedom or life, in the penitentiary
Locked away for a century, yeah, hey yeah, oh yeah
