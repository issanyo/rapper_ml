[Intro: Buckshot talking]
Yeah, be careful what you search for. You might find it. Another one from the Justus League. Boot Camp Clik, BCC

[Verse One]
Half the real niggas get the credit they out for
So respect due to my true outlaws
It ain't about yours or mine
Though half of these niggas who rhyme
Wouldn't know how to flow in they lines
If it wasn't for B.D.I. in his prime
It's a lot of criminals with me that might've been relying on crime
Instead they busting heads on the M.I.C
Leaving the comp dead
Only them I see
Real recognize real that's the law of the land
Violate, fuck iron gates, off with ya hands
See, when ya playing with that gully role
You know the [?] talk, knowing inside, you really a jelly roll
That's how you be caught slippin

[Hook]
"We might find, what we're searching for"

[Verse Two]
Heads come up and they say "hip hop's changed"
Since you in the game, 'Shot, know what's strange?
Same niggas talk money to me
Mad shady
Get the fuck from under the tree
Relax baby
Who you know other than me?
17 had hip hop oven degrees
Led a team on the missions to the thugs and fiends
Well, love my scam you're gonna love my scheme
Cause half of these niggas is butt
Mad soft
We can run up in the office, what?
Mask off
But I choose not to move and lose my composure
I'm there in that whirlwind, yep Timb is over
Nobody can hold us
Back regardless
I'll be in the game till it's tomorrowless
Get it?
No tomorrow 'less we get a spot
If not
Just know I got the keys to ya block
Keep slippin'

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Now everybody got a label or a mixtape
Saying you getting money, but next week you back to ya shift and break
Till your back shift and break
Niggas wanna get big overnight, thinking like they lifting weights
Huh
This is far from a barbell
This mic, this mic stand is representing our hell
Y'all fail every time you try
You get a deal cause you feel from your skill you should now be signed
Huh
The bottom line is the bottom line
Do it right or by the time you'll be outta time
Cause right now, you're nice with your gift and
Watch them hours and minutes
Don't get caught slippin'
