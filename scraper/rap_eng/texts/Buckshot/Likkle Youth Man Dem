Ride wit me, so easily
To the other side of the Timberland tree
You can walk wit me, smoke freely
On the other of the Timberland tree

[Steele]
Likkle Youth Man Dem, said "What's up trooper?"
No disrespect, to Timothy, cuz I know how the youth are
You a true star, shine ya light no matter what ya move for
I got my eye on you, because you represent the future

[Louieville Sluggah]
We be yo gun busters, your gold rushers
Quick to touch and stuff ya, D.O. quicker picker upper, truth

[Starang Wondah]
My mind dwellin, there's no tellin who you see whore
Ass at night, pass to the right
Cuz the weed cause speed ball
Due time laughin, jokin, smokin
Talkin about AK blastin

[Top Dog Big Kahuna]
Don't make me madder than, I am already
Despite it might be a fight, between a loose bullet and a machete
I'm steadily raisin my voice to prove a point
Better be on point, before I decide to pull my joint
Like Spike, we might decide to act up
You relax, huh, it was the victim for the attacker

[Hook]
Likkle Youth Man Dem, Likkle, Likkle Youth Man
You can take a walk wit me and see
Likkle, Likkle, Youth Man Dem, Likkle Youth Man
To the other side of the Timberland tree

[Hook]

[Tek]
What it is? And welcome to the real world, Dig'
I'm not tryin to prophesize, I just wanna see ya live
But you insist on bein fake, you likkle rude man dem
Don gorgon, you curse your mother, wit no problem
And steal a chicken, act fly, you couldn't hold back the cry
When officer mon come give ya lash pon ya back side
Offi' take a look at eye, no meet 'em trife and bar
Because I choose jah and live as rastafari
[Louieville Sluggah]
You can, touch me, hear me, smell, see and feel me
I pray to God, that makes me real G.O.D

[Steele]
I see young bloods in the street yards
Talkin bout "Peace, God", seen God, became a piece
And nigga slang how hard, to be, but I take you through
If you got a few, do it right, somethin like the God rule
The yonder do

[Louieville Sluggah]
I see what you mean, I feel, my brother's don't listen
But how to capitalize, is how my rod is fishin
Deep sea, water, time is gettin shorter
So books and things, they get tossed upon the brawler

[Steele]
Yea, but a lesson learned is a jewel earned for the keepin
So I stay reachin and keep my ass out the precinct

[Starang Wondah]
So, whose to say, crews today
Is really what them bullshit out there, that niggas is tryin to say
Everything I hear, niggas talk about that
They be walkin the streets, and be off wit the gat
Niggas act like you know, if you don't know how to act
Then ya set ya self up for the Originoo Gunn Clap

[Top Dog Big Kahuna]
We are the wickedest Gunn from outta New York
People them talk about them Gunn out the buck
You want dead you get, just put up you fool head up
War is in the midst, and the richie wan gon dead up

[Starang Wondah]
Just the other day, my man from around the way
Used to brag to me, how he smoked a pound a day
He said "Resistance" niggas get hit up wit the instance
Struck from a far, boyakah from a distance

[Hook]

[Steele]
As I knowledge the environment, I am sent
On a mission, reminiscin bout memories missin
Wishin bout moves I should of made
Games I should of never played
Nights I should of stayed in the crib

[Tek]
It's been a while since my sun shine
So many dark clouds out tryin to smother mine
As soon as my boot touch asphalt
Plain clothes and those molds, beemin at my grill, tryin assault
Out my features, sayin I match pictures
They had in they possession, said they wanted I for question

[Steele]
No lesson soon that we know never
Where I'm goin, what I'm doin, who, showin who's proven
All I see is fools coolin on the corner snoozin
Choosin routes that leave them ass out, straight losin
Whose in the place to be faced by some irrelevant cause
Fightin wars that keep your people back off the walls
Of course you be lookin out, like feel look out at the spot
Bout be tooken out, jake stickin out, where we hangin out
So I'm just tryin to see how you makin out
What you thinkin bout, who you thinkin bout
Seein if it's me then, will it be to make a meanin
Right now, seems to be the place
