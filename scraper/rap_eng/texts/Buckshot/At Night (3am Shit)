[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Verse 1]
Trouble in paradise, y’all parasites
See me and my team y’all rather bite
Instead of tellin’ me y’all feelin’ me
I ain’t got a problem I got a poster ya see
Everybody know my grill so I gotta cook
What 9th serve up the beats I gotta fry the hooks
B got a lotta crooks, all kinda forms
Some professional doin’ all kind of wrongs
Some just ride along for the free trip
Wind up cold and high like a ski trip
I don’t really need shit just my mind write
Lookin’ through my rear-view tryna rewind time like
Damn, I shoulda done this that way
But now it’s the bat cave as long as the fat stay
In front of me like a pair of glasses
I see y’all but I don’t hear you askin’ at night
At night

[Verse 2]
It’s trouble in the hood too, you gotta good too
Days without duckin’ the [?] if you movin’ through
I know how the hood do, especially in hoodies
Dream of takin’ this cream far from me
If your mind stay bummy your change in homeless
No dime, no quarter or nickel you own shit so
Why you wanna plot and plan
When the real pot and pans is not in your hand, damn
I could show ya how to bake an enterprise
360 degrees my heat better rise
Led the wives, otherwise I could write ya a “Dear You”
I hear you if you can hear me talkin’
Through your ear, body frame
Everywhere I’m walkin’ at night
At night
