[Hook 2x: Buckshot (w/ Rock)]
Yeah, it's hot on my block (so what)
I'm up in the morning with the hustle (and we doubling up)
What you do? (Bubbling up)
Boot Camp Clik, we plot the plan (and the boss is us)

[Buckshot]
What now? Have a seat, calm down
This is where we had the meet
And the serious inside her, trapped in Cabana
Load ya llamas, cuz they coming with traumas
Plus I promised that it ain't no coming back, this ain't a game
Nigga, quit playing that running back, they ain't planning to run it back
Yeah, you know it's real out here
Ain't no brass on this field, when they kill out here

[Steele]
Well the first thing we gotta do is gather the squad
Like chessboard pieces, we each playing a part
I could move like the bishop, or manuever the pawn
Catch us slipping from a distance, three moves, you gone
Check mate, game over, all your mens defenseless
I'm plotting takeovers, and we shut down business
Shine regardless, shine relentless
We putting work out and I ain't talking physical fitness

[Hook 2x]

[Sean Price]
Aiyo, I dumbed down my dialect and doubled my dough
Ya'll muthafuckas better act like ya'll know
Sean Price a scholar, well versed in the field of rap
Valedictorian, I don't even feel the track
I feel you wack, think you need to step up your game
'Fore I knock you on the floor, pon' step on your frame
Listen, your raps are dumb, you rap for fun
I don't, rap for fun, I rap for funds, P!

[Rock]
Hold up, it goes, one, two, three and to the four
Hold on, dog, you know the four hold three more
So, yo, one, two, three more into the four-four
No safety, the way you suckas 'pose to roll, you scared?
Heat big as my feet, that'll crack your teeth
By mistake, when I back it out, if you standing in reach
Stupid, it's war in the 'Ville
So I walk with that thing, that thing, like Lauryn Ms. Hill

[Hook 2x]

[Top Dog]
Yeah I'm tempted, still thinking up plots to get rich
Still ride for the team, still ride with the fifth
Still some don't get me, still riding my dick
D-O still got love for the shit, you punk bitch
And I'm, up early in the morning, yawning
Dough keep calling, the street team warning me
So watch my back, we got, snitches in the cut, ready to attack
So I, keep that strap, and keep my
Eyes on the boys, case them boys come back
So what?

[Tek]
You better move how I move in these streets, it's hot
Know the real from the fake, and get beat, you think not?
If you get it, better keep it alot, go read
And know the hearts of these men you call peeps, now that's deep
Don't take much for a nigga to flip, change sides
Turn the heat up on a bitch, he gonna fold and hide
Perfect the grind game, get dough, stay low
Burn a strip and give it back, move somewhere and get more
My attitude is like
