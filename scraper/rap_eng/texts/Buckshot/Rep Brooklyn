[Pain In Da Ass]
The new Brooklyn, a nice place to live
But it wasn't always that way...
The neighborhood done changed
But I recall the old Brooklyn
Back then it wasn't known as the 718
It was more like the 187
But shit never changes
An at the end the only thing they remember you by
Is your ReP....
Yeah mothaf***as, its the world famous Pain In Da Ass
'bout to catch reck with my man ReP
Representing that Brooklyn borough
And he about to go old Brooklyn on you mothaf**kas
YOU READY? CAUSE HERE COMES THE PAIN...

[Verse I - ReP]
I took da day off jus ta go harder, I'm so Brooklyn/
Hit it out da park, Go Dodgers/
Brooklyn raised me, betta respect my father/
Tough love that made a n*gga go hard/
Why I don't stop, look what Brooklyn did to me/
I gotta move so struggles can't get too me/
Brooklyn state of mind just let a n*gga step too me/
Why dey call me rep cuz I bring da whole da set with me/
Tell it how it is I'm from Brooklyn/
Our demeanor is kinda like a footprint/
U could respect it or either get stepped on/
Home of trendsetters, how we got da world lookin'/
Eyes on us like da words in a book gets/
Read between da lines Brooklyn gets respect/
No rejects, game holder recess/
Tell em where u from……

[Verse II - Buckshot]
Riding thru the city with my eye's close
I suppose, you f**kin' with me I should pose
For that camera shot, f**kin' amateurs I damage yall
Couple of hammers out hope I don't have to blame my mouth
Cause I will if the fam is out, no doubt
I crack bones and smack homes with that back phone
Blow that dome till that gone, then I
Change to the body position
It's strange when that shottie missing
Yall know how to listen but...
I'ma talk till my voice crack
Bring my mothaf**kin' boys back, you know how they always act
Shorty raw but shot raw
Top baller, top gunner, top bullets in the top drawer
Now I get smooth like velour
I move like the boss, yall move like the boss lost
Flatbush, Crownheights the force
Put em together now I like the course, of course
