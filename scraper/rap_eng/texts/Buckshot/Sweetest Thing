[Intro:]
Yeah
Hanging out
Y’know what i’m sayin
This is where i’m from
This is where i’m at

[Verse 1:] [Buckshot]
Why does the hood remain the hood ma
I don’t know but I know one good thing
That might explain why this shit might’a came
The negroes who know where to go by the train
Conversation the same
Who can I blame
Man this shit ain’t my fault man
I ain't make the strain
I’m born on this ride, yeah
The cyclone of my home
So i’m going on the ride
But still I gotta ask why
Niggas can’t step up to the plate
But you can slide a bit high
House full of little homies
Little timmy with the dirty diapers
Looking like whaddup you know me

[Chorus]
It’s so hood [x3]
But it’s so good
[x4]

[Verse 2:] [T’nah apex]
It’s so good
Doing all that you love, you want
You should make sure you know you good
As a man thinketh so it is in the hood
Understood, manifest the force
Collect the forest
[?] in the room
Medidate
[?] it’s snaking
But just can’t be wasting it away
I got a soul to feed like every day
A king’s county full of queens too
A city where the apple’s just too big
And I don’t know if I should bite through
What will they get me now
Liquor store on every corner
Down misdirection, instead of selling affection
When I finally get the vexing
Perplexing they confused
Take all the shooters where I live
And give them uggs and black boots

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:] [Buckshot]
Diapers out the window
The endo blow
Popo in the lobby of the projects know
What the cause for a half a o
Would have to blow off a half a o
And stash the dough by the door (no)
Get dream, i’m living in the nightmare
I see heads fiend for that nice things, yeah
I’m a product of the people around me
Cowboys tryna be boss
The beautiful bounty
The county that i’m talking about is pure kings
Badaboom badabing not a ring
It’s so hood

[Chorus]
