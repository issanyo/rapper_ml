[Intro:]
Oh yea
P-money
Buckshot
I know you probably like damn
Fuck

[Verse 1:] [Buckshot]
Start the revolution
What the fuck is that
Some new shit?
Nah that nigga buck is back
Introducing the one who only brought the facts
The fact is you are trash
Can you get over trap
Distraction
Who laughing?
I’m dead serious
Ready for action
Fasten your seatbelt
Heat felt from the way I spit my words
Will make your cheek melt
Get help
Import profits
A lot of this based on projects
Cause you a prophet ability
You ain’t feelin me
Who cares
Cause i’m still the nigga you hear
Yeah

[Chorus:]
We in here
We rollin’
This is a warning sign
We holdin’
We hear it all the time
We told em
Don’t back down for shit
Just go in

[Verse 2:][ David dallas]
Let’s take a sec to think back
Never had another lane I wanted to spare
Fucking hunger pains
In the streets the hunger games
One’s loss is another’s gain
So I was looking around at this fuckin lane
Like I should have his spot
His wrist watch by jacob
Typical me want it now not later
But who would have thought
La clippers are now the lakers
Dudes that were hard gimmicks
Turned down to fakers
[?] is now
That ain’t the flavour
My behaviour
Do it for my damn self
Ain’t no favours
Independent duck down
Ain’t no neighbors
So go try they luck now
Ain’t no takers

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:] [Buckshot]
You had a indecision
Buckshot get at em
Nigga listen if you had a mission
What
Followed by the youth of today
Buck stops here
The truth goin’ pay
Move bitch
Get out the way
It’s ludicrous i’m true to this
All day
Vpr stars
See we all stars
We shine and say fuck you
Like gnarls bark
Time to hit the park [for what?]
For a cypher
Smoke weed and pull an all nighter
We all fighters
You ain’t feeling me
Who cares
Cause I’m still the nigga you hear
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 4:] [David Dallas]
What is cool?
Cool is an adjective you can’t learn from school
It’s natural
Got a stack or two
Imma spend it
Tryna get biz marque
She really just a friend
See me after dark
I’m in the park looking sharp
Brooklyn to the heart
My net worth is ummm…
Stop
You ain’t feelin me
Who cares
Cause i’m still the nigga you hear
Yea

[Chorus] [x2]
