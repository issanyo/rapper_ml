[Verse 1: Little Vic]
Handsome Johnny, business man, lives with his fam hardly
Always on the road, back an forth, the mans godly
When it comes to the sales, under his nails no dirt sticks
Pitching the product, tricking the honest
Thinks this Earth is his playground
For days now, out of town seminars
In debt with the bookies
Asked his girls brother to lend a large sum
Tommy, Not to be trusted, out in Vegas
Where he didn't take shit from anybody, he flushed it
But when he got the cash something in his eyes showed
The evil side glowing and no one can try holding him back
Drive slow Johnny, your on the wrong side of the tracks
The 5-0 could find you detached from your head
But instead he took the cash and fled
Back home with his wife rubbing her ass in bed
Cell ringing bout 2:30 shaky female no details
Tommys sister who he sees when he needs tail in Vegas
Grab the phone
"You fucked up man, I'm coming to getchu, know whats up, tough luck, damn"

[Hook: Little Vic]
They talking reckless on the street
They wanna know who sent you
Can't squeal when you deal with the evil that men do
Yeah, the evil that men do
Day to day we all been through
Open the door for certain heads but it depends who
I know this life can be suspenseful
Can't afford that
Its the evil that men do

[Verse 2: Little Vic]
Now Tommy's on his way up, Yo Johnny pay up
How can this white collar stray mutt think he can betray us
Now this is where the ego kicks in, he's gonna find ya
And you ain't got no soldiers with shoulder holsters beside ya
The times up, check the ceiling where your clock is
He locked his big doors and dropped his kids off at his moms crib
Grabbed his shottie in his hands and he cocked it
Mobsters don't knock, pick locks or hold families hostage
Now Tommy's the kind of guy who never been nice
Peddling white, look at his eyes, veteran sight
Had her head in the vice, talkin' screamed his name out, that haunts him
Johnnys scared and second guessin exhaustion
It's deep, but sleep would leave him under-prepared
And he's up and knows the consequence, no wonder he's scared
Its for the money
Not the root of evil but a branch of it
Ego blended in with temptation can be cancerous

[Hook: Little Vic]

[Verse 3: Little Vic]
A gardener buzzing away at his lawn woke him
Yawned, toked; it was all a dream- wrong note
But it seems that he made it through the night unharmed
The gun in palm, got a phone call, I'm coming Mom
On his way up, one life to live lost serenity
Next move get the wife and kids off to Kennedy
And what he's used to now, problems start appealing
Execution stabbed his wife on the copper kneeling
When he opened the door "Do something please Dad"
Johnny with the shotgun, froze up, fell to his knees
Bad move, only for a 100 grand and you got to see
Hell, Tommy said when you arrive save a spot for me
Well, Johnny offered the safe code and pesos
Wedding rings, watches, Tommy uttered I'll talk those
But first here's a little something to the temple
It went through, shots firin', the evil that men do
