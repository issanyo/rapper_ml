[Emcee(s): Buckshot]
[Producer(s): Da Beatminerz (Evil Dee and Mr. Walt)]
[Sample (Melody): Barry White - “Playing Your Game, Baby”]

[Intro: Buckshot]
Yeah, original crooks, original heads.  Doing it like this.  What up?

[Verse 1: Buckshot]
I woke up in the morning, hopped on a train and saw my man. He had
An L in his hand—hide it from the beast, at least
I catch a bus before I hit my block, I take a mega
Hit from it, “On the Good Ship Lollipop”
Move the hop so I can put the hip in the grip
Everybody slip so I can take a trip to the dip
Dig a deeper hole, microphone-control with soul
Look at my hot eyes and tell me, “How could you be cold?”
I’m coming to you from the underground with
Thunder sound.  Number one question: “Yo, how can I be down?”
Well, I’ll tell you: bring your lighter and roll your finger
Back up on your lighter so you see the fire singer
Move from left to right, then front to back
Herbal verbal letters give the mic contact
React whenever I keep the heads scoping
Ahh, don’t front.  You know I got cha opin

[Hook: Buckshot]
Don’t front, you know I got cha opin
It’s the original heads meeting the original crooks
(Duck Down!) Don’t front, you know I got cha opin
Check my dialect from my diaphragm, my man
(Duck Down!) Don’t front, you know I got cha opin
It’s the original heads meeting the original crooks
(Duck Down!) Don’t front, you know I got cha opin
Check the dialect from my diaphragm, my man

[Verse 2: Buckshot]
Me and my crew walk the streets at night like
“Looking for the right one, baby”
If it’s payday, I’m at your doorstep. I never
Sweat swinging the ep’ nowadays ‘cause my rep
Is known for the tricks that’ll trade like toys
In the cypher with my boys, we be getting busy
Wrecking shop.  I drop the top and make the seeds pop
From the lye that I sparked last night in the dark
I be dedicated to the Moon ‘cause it’s Black
Resurrect, come back.  Tell me about the other side
Jack.  Now we’re going back to “Who Got Da Props?”
And when I blew up the spot last year on The Box
Pressure to come back with another fat single
Not too underground to make it stop when you mingle
But bust it, pay attention to the third verse and I’ma
Take you to another level first, yeah

[Hook: Buckshot]
Don’t front, you know I got cha opin
It’s the original heads meeting the original crooks
(Duck Down!) Don’t front, you know I got cha opin
Now you’re sweating Evil Dee, number one DJ
(Duck Down!) Don’t front, you know I got cha opin
It’s the original heads meeting the original crooks
(Duck Down!) Don’t front, you know I got cha opin
Now you’re sweating Evil Dee, number one DJ

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
First of all, listen.  I’m the N you know, but when
You see me at a show, you better prepare for the flow
Right away.  I’m dimming the brighter day—it’s never
Sunny.  Still, don’t nothing move but the honey out
The pay, so I Enta the brother zone.  I come
To the front of Da Stage and let you know who’s on the phone
Leave it alone.  See, it’s a hip hop thang
Not a fake, drip-drop fame or corny-ass lame
You can fool the rest but you can’t fool me.  See
The best school me for the simple fact
It’s the G-O-D, Buck-to-the-shot
Steele to the Tek, then Ruck to the Rock
So forget the past—no more Shorty
Strictly Buckshot, I rock you one down to forty
Below.  I gots to let ‘em know that I e-
-levate at levels higher every time I felt the fire
People tried this when your jam got cold
Used to be the man.  Now your band got old
I know the plan, so I keep ‘em scoping
Don’t front, you know I got cha opin

[Hook: Buckshot]
Don’t front, you know I got cha opin
It’s the original heads meeting the original crooks
(Duck Down!) Don’t front, you know I got cha opin
Check the dialect from my diaphragm, my man
(Duck Down!) Don’t front, you know I got cha opin
It’s the original heads meeting the original crooks
(Duck Down!) Don’t front, you know I got cha opin
Check the dialect from my diaphragm, my man

[Outro: Buckshot]
Yeah, without no doubt, this is dedicated to my man: Big 5, Big Trev.  Real’s in the place to be.  We’re coming to get you out, kid.  And we’re out, no doubt.  Representativz, 5FT (What, nigga?!?)
