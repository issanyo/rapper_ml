[Intro]
I'm just wondering what the heck is in our water supply
What the heck is in our oxygen supply
That creates a rainbow effect in sprinklers?
What is oozing out of our ground
That allows this type of effect to happen?
It's not just around our sun and our moon any more
Everywhere we look, the visible spectrum, is rainbows
This cannot be natural
We as a nation have got to ask ourselves
What the hell is going on?
What is oozing out of our ground?

[Talib Kweli]
The day that I enlisted
Was the result of a prior visit with Jesus Christ felt like I was lifted
Then I got injured and the hospital was like a prison
Fell out of touch with my faith I was nihilistic
They call me Cyclops, cause I was blind in one eye
I'm out the army now I'm tryin' to decide
How to properly fit in with civilians I'm used to killin'
Got me feelin' all confused, who the hero and who the villain?
Hopped in my red Camaro, shot down the street like lead in a barrel
Decked out in my veteran apparel
I drove aimlessly for miles until I saw this
Country that'd want me to kill; I took a bullet for this muh'fucker
Thousand miles later finally made a stop
Small town restaurant, God damn the waitress hot
Ordered tater tots, got her number, later that night
We was at the bar, takin' shots 'til we fell in love
I said let's go Las Vegas and do this
Knew this was the mate for my soul
Drove all night and was awakened to cold
She wanna play the slots, nicknamed her Tater Tot
Cause of how we met, "cool I need a shower, bet"
Found a motel on the strip, I'm checkin' in
When out the blue some Mexicans came in the lobby like they 'bout to shoot
Some Asians that was runnin' down the hall with they guns brazen
Now e'rybody pullin out they shit like it's an invasion!
The Mexicans let them Asians have it; Asians had to fire back
'til they was outta bullets and the blood splattered everywhere
Deal gone bad or somebody robbin'
Either way somebody's rotten all I hear is bodies droppin'
I jump behind the front desk in the nick of time
The crook is on the floor, his blood made me slip and slide
But I'm the last man standin'
A reflex made me grab a cannon out a dyin' man's hand
Then I noticed that a car was runnin'
Sack of guns on the floor plus unmarked bills by the hundreds
Driver comin' at me gunnin'
Sirens blarin' in the distance cause the cops are comin'
I spun around and I hit the deck
Heard the bullets whiz by my ear I let off, hit him in the chest
Quicker than the bullets left the chamber
I grabbed the sack off the floor hit the door with the bangers
Lookin' for my lady at the casino, she was in the zone
I said "We gotta go" she like "Why?" and I'm like "C'MON!"
No need to gamble baby, here the lick
Put the chips down we gotta go right now, this little shit
Now we speedin' down the I-15
First time I noticed that her eyes were green
Gave her a gun and a magazine
I made her count the loot {*count the loot baby*}
But when she saw the score she pointed the gun at me
Now she about to shoot {*blam, blam blam*}
