[Hook]
You better watch what you around, It might be going down
You take that nigga in, you might be outta bounds
So when you turn around, and you hear the click
Your movie is a skit, that’s sick

[Verse 1]
What’s up my nigga? Let me holla at you
Word on the street, I heard police is throwing dollars at you
They got you wired up, that got me fired up
So listen up, I gotta see if they lying or what
Cause that’s fucked up, if it’s true
Duke, you Secret Service? You CIA?
Well, you see I ain’t nervous, and you see I don’t play
I put them cards on the table, three monte
You had the right connect, but you was bigging up the wrong state
Okay, listen
Now I’m looking at niggas, and I’m feeling real funny
It ain’t a joke, though
Why? Cause I’m peeling real money
Nigga, you bummy
Still live with your honey
Donnie Brasco fiasco -- eat, money
You still police, money

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We did a few hustles, had a few scams
That’s why I’m looking like, nah, not you, fam
You used to shoot up in the air, I called you toucan
When police was coming, you was running -- tan blue van
You was my man, damn
Now all of a sudden, I hear you stuttering
When you see the black car no brothers in
Trying to front for BDI like you don’t fuck with them
My nigga, you bugged, but I’m saying you’re bugged from them
No wonder why I seen the whip the other night on the strip
I seen the cop who said alright, shot, trip
And I’ll be there when you fall like the Albee Square Mall
But I’ll be damned if I see you canned like tourists
Nigga, I’mma do me regardless

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ain’t no rules when you doing you
Anybody could get it
Some do it for the love, some do it for digits
Some want to get to the top by any means
If it means coming for your living or seeing prison
