[Chorus:]
Mic check [x2]
You ready yet
Let’s go
Write the cheque
Right respect
Buckshot
Let’s flow

[Verse 1:]
Fighting through the verse
Like my tongue wear kicks
Crew looking at me like
“son where’s this?’
Don’t trip
You be calm
Expose the flows
The flows we are
One second
Two second
I showed the verse
For two records
Who got the props
And who set it
Buckshot shorty
Like nore a true legend
Hit squad
Hit hard
So I
Saw the format
Hit the doormat and said hi
Cool guy so far from shy
More of a superstar in an awesome sky
That cat filled with rap to save lives
Dpr vpr stay vibin
All wielders
All fielders
Buckshot up so high
That I’m scareless

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 2:]
Backpack rapper
With a mainstream flow
Tryna school heads
To the way things go
Visit the game cause we so not cold
So why do rappers exist? [?]
Common sense makes the mind intense
Niggas start to think behind that fence
The time i’ve saved, the time i’ve spent
The ill choices I made behind that bench
That’s my bed I made
I sleep in it
I don’t complain
I keep winning
Keep grinning
Keep spinning
360 degrees keep beginning
I keep beginning
I work smart
Work hard and stay stuck
Who the backpack god
Same buck
Man what?

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Yo p
Let’s get it
Cut it up like
Yeah
New york
The new city like
Nyc everywhere I go
It’s my flow
And ya’ll know
I’m like a hot potato so…
Can’t touch it uh
Can’t grab it uh [x3]
Can’t kick
I ain’t having this [?]
Buck the binc
Duck down is the place to be
