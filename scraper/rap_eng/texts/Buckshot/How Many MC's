[Verse 1]
I'm takin ya back, come follow me
On a journey to see a for real MC
The mind tricks the body, body thinks the mind is crazy
But never sleazy when I get the flow, I'm Swayze
I break, you take
Whatever type of shit the nigga Buckshot makes
The incredible, lyrical, and original
You can kill it, bull, if you wanna take a pull
Whatever I see I attack, tack
Fuck up my back black, nigga fuck that
The devil lurks and my heart irks for the Hell
Look into the eyes of a nigga who fell
I hit my head on the concrete to beat the feet
Another dead nigga in the street
Bullseye, direct hit, don't miss
But how many MC's must get dissed?

[Hook]
"How many MC's must get dissed?"

[Verse 2]
I can break it down like whatever you want
You run like this, I hit but I gets bizzd when I'm pissed
Mister Buckshot rock it not quick
Bitch, get off my dick
I open up and boot em up then shoot em up, whatever
Im clev-ever cuz I wear my leather in the winter
I enter the stage, nigga cock ya gauge
I bust em off some'in awful
And then I leave the stage
Im just a crazy maniac murder a murder type thinkin
Ya shittin, ya ass thinkin, I see ya blinkin
I wet em and forget I never should of met em
But he was talkin' shit to my man so I had to get em
Yep, you can get the fist, whatever
But How Many MC's Must Get Dissed?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got a nigga on scope through the eye of a needle
But I had the nigga pucking on my desert eagle
Pain as a nigga brain I'm goin' insane
Pound after pound and come stomp on ya brain
Pick up the route and be jetty wit the loot
Don't try to walk wit a switch bitch like you cute
You jus couldn't let me stick my dick and ride on the regular
Pen predator, et cetera...yeah right
So fuck what you heard it's about gettin' blipped
In 1993 motherfuckers get dissed
