[Hook]
We keep it going
Day and night, night and day
They all left cause Buck came, right away
Take a breath; who rep, how to play
You might be the best, but not today

[Verse 1]
I’m on fire
The number one indie provider
Set it off whenever we inside her
In place of my face, you see a rider
Underground like collider
A lotta people thought I was a fluke
Cause I had a backpack and some Timberland boots
But the trees still stand
These real fans stuck by me like a mommy saying, “He still can”
Any time you think of my son, think of a tan
Cause he will leave a mark like my name bue can
Damn -- I ain’t never seen niggas stop
But I seen Buck moving in the all-green drop
And the cops on the chase like, he’s full of Scotch
And my block know that Buckshot hustle for the guap
But I won’t do a dance like the Hustle or the Wop
I’ll take it back like classic rock
I’m Buckshot

[Verse 2]
I know why y’all always hiding the truth like a wire
Cause I got a grip on the game -- pliers
You lie around so much, you just a liar
I’m a tire, I roll out of control, low in the hole
We back, we crack like open toes
I suppose I should pose for the cam
But Buck’s so classic, my flow’s Pac-Man
Now, me and 9th is, um, at it again
Soon as I’m off the plane, I grab my pad and my pen
And I go in like doors with no locks
See my nigga Sean P Decept, no Go-Bots
I expect y’all to show props
Show no props, at a show you won’t cop
None of these
Every one of these emcees keep going like a old pair of dungarees
Ho, please -- I’m tired of pop
Lady Gaga hip-hop, her name Buckshot
