[Hook: Buckshot]
I wake up, open my eyes up
Surrounded by my haters as soon as I rise up
But then I realize what I'm here for
Then I say to myself "man, I need more"
I wake up, open my eyes up
And thank god for playing a part of my rise up
But then I realize what I'm here for
Then I say to myself "man, I need more"

[Verse 1: Buckshot]
Thinking of a way, to say what I gotta say
All lines are so limited, only a few stay
The rest leave as my sleeve fall
In the same position my hand do
How I ran through
So many pages at one time
That I can't look behind
Got my mind feeling blind
Damn, how am I confused?
What am I to do?
What am I to choose?
Where do I start?
Where do I begin?
This ain't like writing a letter back in the days, "Dear friend"
Cuz, every blot from my pen something
And if I slip one irrelevant line I'm done in

[Verse 2:]
These are the times, I find I've got a devious mind
I got a hunger and I wonder, will it lead me to crime
Deep in the grind, That's probably the reason that I
Feel like I'm falling, hell's calling, niggas do or we die
Plain and simple yo It's mathematic
I speak emphatic, slinging crack to these rap addicts
I bust my pistol like I'm Pat Garret
The break is over and I'm back at it

[Verse 3: Sean Price]
A-yo
Beat battering beast from East Africa
Heat clap at your fleet leaving your peeps mad at us
Duckbill Platypus, Ruck real, add it up
Solar power calculator, for haters an abacus
Sean Price athletic, the Bruce Jenner
The deuce deuce center
Bust crohn's and Sean gone 'till November, listen
I'll be back but for now just settle
Y'all motherfuckers ain't on Ruck's level
I want more

[Hook: Buckshot]
I wake up, open my eyes up
Surrounded by my haters as soon as I rise up
But then I realize what I'm here for
Then I say to myself "man, I need more"
I wake up, open my eyes up
And thank god for playing a part of my rise up
But then I realize what I'm here for
Then I say to myself "man, I need more"

[Verse 4: Steele]
General Steele!
This is a soldiers rendition
On the his road to perdition
Tote the chrome for you niggas
Mango gave control of the business
Flows on my children, can't joke with you niggas
Flow serious, ride with ambitions
To get richer get my nigga Ruley on out of prison
Few good men gone, chosen few still livin'
Sticking to the regiment, I go to war for what I represent
