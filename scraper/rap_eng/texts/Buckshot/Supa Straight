[Chorus]
Bought a fucking oz, so you know i’m supa straight
Lick lick and stick the paper lick and stick the paper lick and stick the paper
Bought a fucking oz, so you know i’m supa straight
Lick lick and stick the paper lick and stick the paper lick and stick the paper
Bought a fucking oz, so you know i’m supa straight
Lick lick and stick the paper lick and stick the paper lick and stick the paper
Bought a fucking oz, so you know i’m supa straight
Lick lick and stick the paper lick and stick the paper lick and stick the paper

[Verse 1]
Bought a fucking oz now you know i’m supa straight
Bullets started flying to your chest watch it penetrate
Messing up your fucking lungs heart about to fucking burst
Taking care my business still blow one with my nigga Zirk
Game don’t never change and you niggas y’all can hate this shit
My click is too thick and you still fucking with [?]
Chiefing on a blunt for a minute watch i get a buzz
[?] me out i’m coming shooting to kill cause there ain’t no love
Tired of you bitches perpetrating niggas constantly playing
Bitches get me hot best believe ima start spraying
Buckshot do not give a fuck constanly cause we chiefing chicken
Stopping at the liquor store get full then we [?] bitches
Tossing up these niggas like pancakes i keep a tone
Peace to Orange Mound but my hood call it dixie home
Suckers that be trying me bodies get left near a lake
I bought me an oz my nig now i’m supa straight

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
It’s seems that society lables me as a thug
They can’t understand why this young black man is going drugs
Since i was a shorty life was fucked so i needed a break
I’d watch my momma smoke her bud still [?] out of the ashtray
Dash out the back door The Buck is up to no good
Its 1994 guess what’s popping in my hood (in my hood)
Niggas splitting swisher sweets
Fuck, there no razor blades
Well might just use your finger nails heres an oz let’s get supa straight
Now take that damn cigar skin and fill it up with marijuana
Light ‘em up and smoke ‘em like a slippin’ trick that’s on your corner
Man this bud has got me and i know it cause i’m staring to choke
[?] than some indica im higher than a mink coat
Nobody fucks with me
Buckshot is straight doing fine
Bitches get your hands off me
You might push me off cloud 9
Hoes don’t get mad at me
I’m sorry i don’t love ya got a ounce of that shit and i’m straight as a motha’ fucka’

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now lets grab them chrome thangz and head for the suckers slang
[?]
Cause you know [?] don’t play
Im all about my hussle when i see them things step my way
Gotta get my ends gotta keep some Gs that’s how it be
If i [?] I’d be fucked up in the game G
Too thick like my blood
I don’t show no fucking love
To them [?] head ima serve them ‘til they braindead
Now back to the track, i got to sell this crack
I see them junkie robbers tryna creep up they don’t want no black
I got some fellow dope boys they got my back when i jack
So i know what i lack they surely will pack
So back up off this pimp so i can [?]
