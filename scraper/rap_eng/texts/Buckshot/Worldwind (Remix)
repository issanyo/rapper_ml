[Buckshot]
Buck Buck Buck, stay in the cut
Try to fuck wit this, you get two to ya gut
Nigga what, what? All that shit you poppin is irrelevant
You talkin for the hell of it, you need to back the fuck up
Before you get clacked the fuck up, on some '86 shit, jack the fuck up
Bring da ruckus, all these thorough niggas that's among us
Put a bullet in your lung-us, listen
I ain't gonna ask ya niggas why ya diss
Cuz when I aim I never miss, my gun'll leave you breathless
Blow out ya chest and leave you chestless, you tasteless
I can't respect ya niggas, cuz you can't face this
Nigga named Buck, in the flesh, what?
Yeah, I seen ya lookin but ya mouth stay shut
But, you get you throat cut steppin the wrong way
Fuck the foreplay, pussy, bong 'em all day

[Chorus 3X]
This is what is sounds like, when you're caught in the worldwind

[Buckshot]
You need to back the fuck up, before you get clacked the fuck up
On some '86 shit, jack the fuck up
Let me tell ya niggas my name, I'm Buckshot
I rock all spots, and I stay on the block
Wit lot's of niggas who say fuck the cops
Cuz every time we in the street
They think we sweet, like we butterscotch
So I gotta turn it up a notch
And keep the extra Glock inside the crotch
And take ya niggas back like I'm Mayor Koch
To the days of crack birth, that's when ya got smacked first
If you didn't have your G up, on you re-up
They pop niggas like you, drop niggas like you
On the real, I never really liked niggas like you
But I still, see you snakes walk pass the jakes
On the regular, in Bucktown and put you in you're place
Glock to ya face now, time to face the tune, you ain't a killer
What nigga, fake dealer, on the real-a
Ya niggas need to chill a little bit
And stop talkin shit and sit off my did-ick

[Chorus 4X]

[Hook 4X]
Duck Down nigga, what what?

[Buckshot]
Buck flow with the speed of a bobsled
Bust led to the head, plus I stay red
Every time I think about the dead
I think about what Makaveli said, lick a shot, fuck the one's who bled
In this MC shit, we agree shit got outta hand
But they ain't stop the plan, uneffective
No respect for this, but my perspective is
Niggas who walk the path of the straight and narrow
We could rule the land like Pharaohs
Plus enjoy the bone to the marrow, delicious
Eat 'em up, and fuck 'em real quick to break fast
Shatter niggas dreams like glass-a-ass
How many niggas wanna get with this shit?
Mix the booze and sip wit this, it's what it sounds like

[Chorus 7X]

[Hook 4X]

[Buckshot]
Just inhale, and exhale
Buckshot, I keep it real, I rock the spot still
I do it like, I do it like, I do it like
I do it like

[Chorus to fade]
