[Chorus:]
This is my introduction (duction)[x5]
This is my introduction (duction, duction, duction, duction)

[Verse 1:]
In the game of life
I’ve learned one thing
You can’t turn a rock
Into a bright diamond ring
A rock is a rock
A diamond is a diamond
Both solid as hell
But one not shining
Maybe it’s the timing
I’m being sarcastic
Cause truthfully most of these dudes
Are lazy bastards
Ass backwards
My last master taught me well
Father said never praise jail
Even though I raised bail
A couple of times
It was true jail niggas
Who said fuck with the rhymes
I hear you
Cause you been tryna hear me
Saying I did the same shit you did
To make [?]
No way
You telling me sonny don’t play
You invested time in crooks
But crime don’t pay
The cost
Do me a favor get lost
Find yourself on that business course
To be a boss

[Chorus]

[Echo to end]
