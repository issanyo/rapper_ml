[Verse 1: Buckshot]
It's an all out warfare, a take over
The money, the rap the hustle, it's all over
Even if your range is rover
It better be bullet proof when you're paying your toll
'Cause, I might be dressed in uniform
One shot from Buckshot, nigga you gone
And, I don't push the button for nothing
So if I start reaching you should start ducking, trust 'em
Where I come from, we plot for hours
On the block for hours, so the cops acknowledge
Every spot, every crack, every nook and cranny
But we still got that neighborhood crackhead granny
Like, "psst, child here they come"
"They gone it's cool, now give me some"
Yeah, you see the power of the dollar
Like I said it's a war, now this side you follow, nigga

[Hook: Buckshot, (Rock)]
I want mine
(I want mine)
And with this weapon here, fuck that I'mma lay 'em down
(Lay 'em down)
I want it all
(Want it all)
And fuck y'all, when you come through I'mma lay you down
(Lay you down)
I want this (what?)
Enough chips? We front yeah
(Go ahead front)
And I'mma lay you down
(Lay you down)
I want y'all, with your fake pounds, fuck around
(Huh?)
And I'mma lay you down
(Lay 'em down)

[Verse 2: Steele]
Grand prize, strategize, niggas tryna organize
Timz n Hood Check, right back in the front lines
On the grind, all the time
Rhymes without the punchline
Just a few lessons you can use when it's crunch time
Day one, knee deep, lotta work, little sleep
One root in the streets, one in the industry
Kick the door, let us in
Camouflage, Timberlands
Boot Camp assembling on the hunt for the dividends

[Verse 3: Supreme]
Yo it's the S-U-P-R
Putting niggas in ER's
I see y'all, sleep on the kid like I won't bust my heat off
Y'all don't wanna test me, I'm strictly business like Leigh y'all
You fake fucks, you ain't the type of niggas that we are
General Batista, Nigga don't even [?]
You just a toy soldier, your batteries need a recharge
Guitar smoke 'em like marijuana in my cigar
Nigga's is dumb and I ain't got the time to teach y'all
We scar niggas with rusty shanks like them bodequa's
With a bad Mamacita that stack the shit in her knee highs
Mirra, yo we still in the hood livin la vida, loca
Swing for the fence like Sam Sosa
It's ova, Eye on the prize hand on my toaster
Black for culture, keep it where I'm supposed ta
Bitch you can't come close to my clique
You know what is approach an get hit

[Hook: Buckshot, (Rock)]
I want mine
(I want mine)
And with this weapon here, fuck that I'mma lay 'em down
(Lay 'em down)
I want it all
(Want it all)
And fuck y'all, when you come through I'mma lay you down
(Lay you down)
I want this (what?)
Enough chips? We front yeah
(Go ahead front)
And I'mma lay you down
(Lay you down)
I want y'all, with your fake pounds, fuck around
(Huh?)
And I'mma lay you down
(Lay 'em down)

[Verse 4: Sean Price]
Yo, I'm spraying a round, I'm laying it down
Then dip in the whip, I ain't stayin' around
Niggas think Sean playin' around
Put my fist in your face, watch how fast the god cave in your crown
Now, you ain't king, stop claiming the crown
With your big red shoes, duke, I'm claiming you clown
Sean Price is the greatest in town
In a hood near you, big face, big eighth and a pound
P!

[Verse 5: Rock]
Listen, this robbery rap
You can almost feel the chron in your back
When I tell you throw your hands up, man up
I bring a shotty to rap, like, "fuck rap"
If it ain't me or my camp than it's probably wack
Lay the whole shit down down like Nelly first single
He don't know, somebody better tell him how we do
Metal will send you to hell in a single second
Don' tell me 'bout evil
The [?] ain't there for you, I'mma sell to your peoples

[Hook: Buckshot, (Rock)]
I want mine
(I want mine)
And with this weapon here, fuck that I'mma lay 'em down
(Lay 'em down)
I want it all
(Want it all)
And fuck y'all, when you come through I'mma lay you down
(Lay you down)
I want this (what?)
Enough chips? We front yeah
(Go ahead front)
And I'mma lay you down
(Lay you down)
I want y'all, with your fake pounds, fuck around
(Huh?)
And I'mma lay you down
(Lay 'em down)

[Verse 6: ]
We got whores out sayin' "put them weapons away"
But any old way I'm reppin' the AK
Reppin' for BK, weaken the sensei
Looking to get paid
Niggas in my way
Lookin' to get sprayed
Straight from the PJ's
Ducking from police, fucking if you creep
Trust me man don't sleep
On my and my G's, we leave you six feet
With no flowers, to sleep

[Hook: Buckshot, (Rock)]
I want mine
(I want mine)
And with this weapon here, fuck that I'mma lay 'em down
(Lay 'em down)
I want it all
(Want it all)
And fuck y'all, when you come through I'mma lay you down
(Lay you down)
I want this (what?)
Enough chips? We front yeah
(Go ahead front)
And I'mma lay you down
(Lay you down)
I want y'all, with your fake pounds, fuck around
(Huh?)
And I'mma lay you down
(Lay you down)
