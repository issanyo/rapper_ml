"Sunlight shining"
Shining y'all

[Verse One: Arafat Yates]
Buckshot and 9th Wonder
Historical hip hop, it shine on that
Blind to the fact what this rap shit brought
To you and yours
How many doors got opened?
How many kids sat in front of they stereo's hoping?
To get a shot one day
Now it's like the game just won't wait
MC's get walked on like runways
And no type of fashion involved
Remember those days when you was asking your dawg
"When the next BCC drop?"
We need props and Arafat work on that while biters eavesdrop
Please stop
Before we leave MC's hauling ass
Me and my team shine the big ball of gas
All y'all ass like Jack like back, why you fronting?
Them cowards afraid to try something
New Buckshot and 9th bring the real out
Cause I shine, you shine, The Formula spills out

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Big Chopps]
Yo, who you rhyme for?
I shine for this MC shit
Lyrics labelled as abominable spit
This is hip hop
Study a verse over cracked pavement
Try to relax but I'm past patience
Pierce hearts like bow and arrow
And I shine/Shyne behind bars Jamal Barrow
You lyrical how?
Go to war for this hip hop seminal style
Ya clones like clinical cows
Face gripping a frown
Master the fact that you cats ain't real
So I shine like the glare on the steel
No killer
100% hip hop with no filler
Dummy smack you funny cats like Ben Stiller
Me and Arafat remind you of days
Like in '93 Enter Da Stage
Pen pressing the page
For the veterans, I sharpen my blade
Wrecking these mics for minimum wage
But I shine
Fresh
Something like grapes from the vine
Ask yourself, who fucking with mine?
Not a soul

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Buckshot]
I used to see the black clouds, cover my background
From all of the bullshit, so this is how I act now
Yup, I calmed down
A whole lot
I used to be a wild little nigga a whole lot but oh not
I see my future
And yeah, it's looking real bright
I'm Sunshine Edison, I got my men and 'em so now I feel right
Like Chappelle, I see darkness spreading
So whenever you come around, that's the part when I'm jetting
No more stressing
All I see is the light in the sky
Then I
Crack the window, let it right in my ride
Then I
Lean back and put the seat on recline
The beat on rewind
The cell on decline
I-95 just to find that lah
Head back to NY
Get high with pure profit
Stop it
You don't want me to shine
I know it's hard to see me have a hell of a time
But look
Be easy and let the sunshine come in
Cause when the po po come in, they bust the 1-9 in
It's over
