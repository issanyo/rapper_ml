[Intro: Sean Price (Rock)]
Damn... you miss me? I miss you, too
I know it's been a while...
But I got plans for you...
But first thing I plan on doing..
Is fucking smacking your head off
You stupid bitch, fuck I look like
R&B singer? Huh?
It's fucking gorilla rap right here, nigga
Heltah Skeltah, you punk bitch
(There these niggas go with that rugga retarded shit again
B-C-C, excuse me while I get my N.W.A. on for a second
Yeah! Magnum Force in this muthafucka!
Black Mafia for life
Down with some real niggas for life! Ha hah
Aiyo, yo, Jamon, tell them niggas what we here for...
Well all rite ya'll, N.Y.C., Brownsville
East, New Rulers, all across the muthafucking U.S.A
They know I walk through the valley of the real, nigga
I should fear no man and no muthafucking clan
Cuz I done been through the mountain top
And I done see through the eyes of a real nigga
Hit me one time Alkatraz
Aiyo they make some of the coolest shit I done never heard!
Yeah BummyFlyJab, I must give it up
To the Boot Camp muthafucking gorillas
Some of the realest, the realest niggas you gone ever see
You understand? We fear no mob
Because you scared, man, you scared, man, you scared!
You don't understand, you making two words, you make 'em say
You scared, man, buck buck buck, keep Babylon on the run, shit
Bringing forth Heltah Skeltah!)

[Rock]
You ask for it, who want beef? Well you got it!
It's poppin', we locking and loading, and, you drop it
Pop lock and drop it, them niggas from the Grimeyville
Ain't nobody fighting fair, throw ya fucking mom down a flight of stairs
So let the D.I.R.T. doing begin
It's truly "DA BEGINNING OF DA END" for you and your mens
It's hot, we cooking "APE FOOD" up in "HELLZ KITCHEN"
Son ain't feeling your heat neither, can't you tell, we "TWINZ"
This ain't crunk, not hypthy, not snap
Not screw, not pop, not quite boom bap
It's rugga, "SMACK MUZIK", bang ya head music
Niggas with "WMD's" bang ya lead to it
Peep "THE ART OF DISRESPEKINAZATION", niggas be "SO DAMN TUFF"
But then they be snitching, "THAT'S INCREDIBLE" ain't it?
It's "INSANE", I see how niggas "RUCK N ROLL"
Don't flip hoes, that's bad luck, I split ya fucking dome
Everybody do a little bit of "D.I.R.T."
Dude just a hater, snatch you up ya little sister shirt
Give yo bitch ass lashes til ya back for my belt
Til it welt pump, "EVERYTHING IS HELTAH SKELTAH"
