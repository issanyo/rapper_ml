[Hook]
Every day
When I’m on the streets, ain’t no time to play
All I do is look up in the night, I don’t see no light
All I do is see the dark, then I let my gun spark
Listen

[Verse 1]
Everyday I wake up, I’m thinking of something different
My life is just like a visit, I’m only here for a minute
Fuck it, I gotta get it
Nothing y’all gotta give it
I’m doing a lot of business
Everybody just drop and just give me
One hundred push-ups
What’s up with Buck?
He here, you not
You scared, you shot
I dare two cops to play the hero -- uh oh
Whether or not you agree with my vision, a lot of niggas rot in the prison
Power no different
Television is telling lies, so I
Hit the street, street Bible wise
And tell the Ten Commandments
My niggas is bandits
Outlandish with hammers, no wonder why they can’t stand us
Cannabis, fatigues, raw power
Strapped for the battle, I’m walking the block with ease
Let’s go, let’s go

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I’m on fire, call me molten metal
It ain’t my folks you settle
This shit I spit go through metal, I roll with the devil
Every dollar in my pocket’s from the flows I pedal
Like handbags of Louis and Gucci come up
You a replica of the real
Almost there, so what?
I ain’t never seen ya CD
Only D I see is the D’s that sweep me
With me, a frisbee out at night
Who didn’t disappear on em? Yeah, I ain’t on em
I was in the zone
Take money money, make money money, that’s the only thing on my dome
I’m a beast if I don’t eat
Fuck beef, all I need is a rapper or one beat
I’m a boss
You Chinese niggas is duck sauce
You half a chicken
Go half on your living
Get lost

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I’m a murderer
A motherfucking killer on the loose
Y’all niggas is filla on the roof
I know, I can’t get mad at you
But I can say ‘Damn, that’s bad for you’
Broke ass, broke glass, cut it nigga severely
Fuck what you heard, y’all niggas hear me
I’m bullhorn, you niggas bullshit, come one
Got bitches waiting on my lawn
I walked at night like Spawn
(?), oh yes, half that niggas is gone
Make moves, my shit is SA-radius
Street approved in the jails like the essay’s rated
