[Verse One: Buckshot]
Boo-Ya-Kaa, check my file and my style
Never on the Isle, Buckshot was a juvenile
A little freestyle fanatic, I shot the rap addict
With an automatic, now I got static
See back in the days, I was a stone cold hood
And now I'm just a paid hood, still up to no good
With my crew from the Heights and the Island
Still flippin' niggas, and we still be buckwildin'
I never changed, never rearranged my finesse
Buck one time to your chest, through your vest
F.A.P.: Franklin Avenue Posse
You can't stop me, cause my shits never sloppy
I'm always on point, I pack, a joint and a burner
Flip a scene, coming from a Teen like Turner
Take it from another brother coming from the ghetto
Once I get my ride ain't no need for the metro
I get paid to rip, step aside I'mma blow you
Don't try to shake my hand money grip, I don't know you
I'm just a hardcore, raw, straight from the ave
Leave another question and you might get blast

[Hook 4x]
Ack like you want it
Ack like you want it
What! Bring the drama
Ack like you want it

[Verse Two: 5 Ft. Excellerator]
I bursted in a rage, catching wreck on stage
Blowing up the spot, I leave my name engraved
You frail ass niggas want a piece of the 5, but
You can’t fuck around with the nigga that’s live
Here catching wreck, with the Buckshot Shorty
Spark up that L, cause it's time to get naughty
Then he looked at me as if I was insane
I'm just a real nigga with a lot on my brain
The pressure starts to build, when I grab the steel
Giving niggas the raw deal, with the mad appeal
This time around, I flex the Tec with ease
And if you really want it, I give an extra squeeze cause I’ll
Carve out your heart, and leave it pumping in my hand
Spit on your grave, and let you know who's the man
There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
Cause, the 5 Ft. Accelerator, is at your every side
One time for your motherfucking mind...

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Buckshot]
I ran to the boom spot, and shot the dread
He finished my nickel bag of skunk weed, now he dead but
Bust lead to the head, never did like a Fed
Rule with the mad tool, fool check what I said
I'm taking you down, I'm breaking you down, I'm real
Wiz, Tek and Steele, niggas, you know the deal
I’m for real no joke, soke on the gun smoke
Provoke, your dusty style, makes me choke
Never bite, but I write, when I grab mics
Boot your pretty bitch ass boy, and take flight
With my razor, the infra-red laser, blaze ya
Like cane, I raise your little shortie's bad behavior
Niggas better know when I flow, that I'm strictly business
And I’m in there when I flaunt it
ACK LIKE YOU WANT IT

[Hook]

[Verse Four: 5 Ft. Excellerator]
From the town where niggas always get bucked down
Kicked in the door, keep my finger on the pound
Word is around, that you're looking for the 5
Surprise, real niggas always survive
Don't be amazed, I'm alive from the flames
No need to scream now you're calling out my name
You little bitch ass nigga, you tried to take my life
Now I'm taking all you own, plus I'm fucking your wife
After that I'll have my man go and hit your only daughter
And leave her body floating in some bloody bath water
Just like a snake I hiss-s-slither on the ground
Nobody hears me move or even know that I'm around
You acting like you want it, now you're gonna have to get it
As I grab you by your throat, feel the heat as I just split it

[Hook]
