To all my hardcore niggas don't forget me (don't forget me)
I know the game change and all of these niggas wanna switch me
To all my hardcore niggas don't forget me (don't forget me)
I know the game change and all of these niggas wanna switch me
"Hardcore, far more than the average"

[Rock]
To all my hardcore niggas yo I'm still the same
Won't let the game change me, I'm trying to change the game
This shit is mad lame -- hip-hop party rules no jeans, Timbs
Or hoodies or hats, sound like you mean me -- fuck ya!
You still get shot up ain't nuttin there but players
Fuck you think? Nigga steppin on your thousand dollar gators
Stupid-asses -- you shook at the site of party crashers
At the door actin, like you don't know who Bummy Jab is
They tell you Rock, tellin me, "Don't act no fool"
"You heard of scotch on the rocks?" I make the whole shit cool
But I'mma stay the same ghetto-ass, baggy pants draggin
Deep rollin heat holdin nigga til I'm triple platinum

To all my hardcore niggas don't forget me (don't forget me)

M.F.C.!!
Hey hey, that's my partner Price man
The whole industry's against him and me
Like thugs are to death penalties
But we got the remedy for all that punk shit
One clip up in the macra
Make wiffleballs out all of you popcorn rappers
Callin my crew haters, knowin damn well you hate me
But scared to stick it to me, knowin damn well I break teeth
Alcatraz, forever Rock hard, got scars for this rap shit
Got locked behind bars, fluck the actin
All my grimy-ass cannon handlers, standin in the lobbies
Stay forever rowdy, niggas _It's Your World_ like Bobby
Rob these, cats claimin they got so much cheese
When it's zero degrees and send they monkey-asses home freezin
Reppin for my housin P's and, catch me out in Shaolin
Whylin with Ghost, Deck, and Tical and them
Before I'm out the door big up my Outlaw niggas
My hardcore lovin thirsty out for war niggas

To all my hardcore niggas don't forget me (don't forget me)
I know the game change and all of these niggas wanna switch me
Never that, I'm constantly comin with clever raps
We sever that, take your head and slap em leather strap
You better pack, your gat or the outcome you outdone
I doubt them, niggas can fuck with the Ruckus without fun
Aiyyo what this about son? Aiyyo witness a nigga clout son
Trippin with these chickens and sippin on Guinness Stout son
Without them, this nigga who jumped up and asked me
"Are you fuckin my sister man?" when that bitch Butch like Cassidy
HELL NO, quick fast this man caught the elbow
Shells load, he fell froze, buck stuck like velcro
His man yelled, "Yo, ain't no need to fuckin draw gats
We all black" Put the gat down, I left his jaw tapped
I saw that, Duke ain't want no beef in the first place
Just a gerk face nigga tryin to rep his birthplace
The worst case scenario, I leave your ass shot up
Fuck up my rap product and back to crack narcotics
The moral of this story is -- there is no moral God
Just my shit is hard, and if your shit ain't like us
Youse a fraud, motherfucker

[Rock]

"Hardcore, far more than the average"
