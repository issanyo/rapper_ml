[Intro: Sean Price]
Welcome
The name of this album is Monkey Barz
And I'm your host, Sean P
What you're about to witness here my brother
Is ignorance at its finest
Peep my words

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
I'm better than mine, Sean Price, remember this time
I'm all that, jaw tapped, pa, Gregory Hines
Strapped from the war, I got a package of raw
In the ass crack of this whore in the passenger door
Y'all niggas is wack and should be slapped with the four
Shit like that be attracting the law
Can't get knocked, better yet, can't get shot
Bust a shot at the 'Bad Boy', can't be stopped
Listen to my old shit, they be like "Damn they hot
What happened to them niggas, man, they flopped" - word?
Drinking and smoking, vice versa, smoking and drinking
I'm hoping these Lincolns add up I ain't supposed to be stinking
Y'all niggas is farsighted, didn't notice the kingpin
Up close in your face, bust toast in your face

[Hook: Sean Price]
Peep my words, words, heavenly word
Words that get niggas locked up in 73rd
Peep my words, words, heavenly word, words
Words that get niggas locked up, locked up, locked up

[Verse 2: Sean Price]
Aiyyo, I'm bustin the cronz, call me Ruckus but Sean's
The name that I choose to be called when I'm in front of my moms
Get it the fuck from in front of me pa
The number one stunner gunning for y'all, listen
I got little guns that'll straight pounce ya melon
Got big guns 'bout the size of Mount St. Helen
Soon as I punch a nigga he like "Ouch, I'm tellin'"
Gotta bounce down south with Welling
What up cuz?
I'm Sean Price, watch me lead this shit
Boot Camp, no fatigues and kicks, nigga
Y'all niggas is fake, straight perpetrating a fraud
Give me the cake 'fore I insert the 8 in your broad
Scared to death niggas going face to face with the lord
Dumb out, bang your motherfucking face in the board
Fuck around and catch wreck in the spot, sket will go pop
Heckler & Koch, wrecking your knot, fled from the cops

[Hook]
