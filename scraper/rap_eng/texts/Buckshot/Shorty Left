[Intro: Buckshot]
I’m out for my dough, cause I ain’t doing what you said
I’m out for my dough, cause I ain’t doing what you said
Spread rumors like butter on the bread
I’m out for my dough, cause I ain’t doing what you said

[Verse 1: Buckshot]
This is my life; my L-I-F-E
I ain’t leave my wife, my wife left me
I was on my grind; G-R-I-N-D
She said she heard of labels but mines was indie
What that mean? That mean everything all mine
And the check’s all good, but it’s not all the time
I’m under the impression that you get it
But you still leave me hanging like a necklace, fine
I’mma do mine, I mean do me
If you need a checkup you should find an MD
Until then, my prescription is how to act right
Hold me down and not back, right
See, I was thinking about you last night
Hoping that you would see the real, no flashlight
Let me ask you like, a few questions
The first one is, ‘Why the hell do you stress?’ and the second where the checks went
This is me and you, on the grind too
You should have my son. Why? So he could shine too

[Hook: Buckshot]
Why you never satisfied? But you advertise
Walk the streets with your peeps and talk a lot of lies
Spread rumors like butter on the bread
I’m out for my dough, cause I ain’t doing what you said
I’m out for my dough, cause I ain’t doing what you said
I’m out for my dough, cause I ain’t doing what you said
Spread rumors like butter on the bread
I’m out for my dough, cause I ain’t doing what you said

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
I supported dreams and everything that you wanted
But what about my own? Ain’t got the family I wanted
I know your grind keep the lights on, a roof over us
Refrigerator’s full but I wanna drive a new Rover
And how we gon’ have a son and you ain’t never home for me?
Maybe you should think of going major cause these indie G’s
Don’t keep me pleased in the latest fashions from Fendi
I can't have my son growing up eating Wendy’s
You a good man, never cheated on me, yeah true that
And we living comfortable but I want you to be famous
Me and that money take family trips to the Caymans
Okay man, I get it though, you ain’t really so with that
So I ain’t with you no more, make a choice or I’m leaving
It’s me or the music, go major, extend your Visas
I know you’re happy, but for real, I think you’d better please us
If I ain’t happy then you won't never be happy neither
