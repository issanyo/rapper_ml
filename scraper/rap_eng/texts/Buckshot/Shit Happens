[Louieville]
Thinking bout the shit that's in my head, type
Of shit that put a nigga on the lead slip then ya' dead
I gotta take a vacay, on some uncharted island pilot on the
Mic yellin may-day, tryin ta stay away from he say she say
But, forever jealous niggas still be beefin'
Ville still hit the curb cuff leaking
Kickin' it wit pop's out back
Up in the Lincoln
Tricking on my baby mom's
Now I'm dead stinking
He smacked me in the back of the head, "boy what you thinking?"

[Starang]
Word up, in my lex there's only room for two Neeta
And Will that's me and you, smoking weed with hash
We ride pass in slow mo', up in the new GS with the
Sixteen(16) inch mobo's I had ta drop Neeta off pick up my dog
Henny, cause ho's come a dime a dozen and we got plenty
Aiiyo shit's to slow I gotta say speed up, we got dough to blow
So we can get weeded up, now we ride around in the car with
The seats heated up with the spliffs in our mouth and the henny
In the cup, yo fill it up

[Louieville]
Till the rim with brim like it was coffee slamin the door I had
To tell her to back off me

[Starang]
And some of our best friends is dike bitches with benz's, M-F-C tat's
And blue contact lense's

[Louieville]
So I had to sit back and just catch the breeze, the conjiac got me
Losing a few chest string's but there it was in between the bass trebling
Off the hook that's what you caughing

[Starang+Top Dog on cellar phones]
Yo' who the fuck is this?

[Top Dog]
I was on my way to New Lots after that the weed spot
Don't buy the dutch's cause I don't wanna get busted
By a crooked copper cause that shit aiint proper
Creep and hide the stash tell him you from jamacia
Will the cop believe me or will he do me dirty take me
To the system and say I tried to diss, but he told me calmly
Get back in ya' car B move away slowly and pretend you never
Saw, you can bet I did just that I didn't even look back I had
Twelve(12) dime's and a QP in the back I enough start a party
I even bible study wit Starang and Henny smoking on a Bob
Marly, as if you didn't no it was the ten(10) second mover
Steppin cluthches to this song take me home

[Louieville]
