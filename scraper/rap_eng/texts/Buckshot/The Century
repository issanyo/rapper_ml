(Hook – Jonathan Emile & Angela Nashed)
Melodies like memories of where we are
Memories like melodies of where we are
In the dissonance of time…

(Verse 1 - Jonathan Emile)
It's been a long time coming
Harriet Tubman, a brother stay running
Towards freedom flyer than the blackbird
How these dudes lack thought but never words?
The Century is power
My crew shows up with the 11 nines like the twin towers
I’m the 12th disciple
Never need a rifle
Swearing on the Bible
Take oath and break the cycle
Yeah I'm in the house like Barack Obama
Bowtie so fly, I know they want to bring drama
Dem too small fi we
Only a slave to my destiny I shall succeed
Intelligent black men are endangered
Polar, Grizzly, Panda I bear it all
Feeling like DuBois at Niagara Falls
Step fresh call it moonwalk like Armstrong, Houston copy this they can't not
Represent the whole future and the have-nots
I have lots, homie get your own
Times a chaperone
You are not alone

(Verse 2 - Buckshot)
You never could keep a good man down
In the hood man down
Mean the cops is around
Do you hear the sound?
Do you feel the ground or the cuffs?
It don’t matter cause soon as you turn around there’s a snuff
Enough we puff to the memories when they freed us
Went from slaves to made leaders
God lead us on the path of righteous
Cause I might just slip up and clip up like this
Extra mags, few extra bags
Who’s next to crash save the best for last
Oh yes the flags is raised for war
I just can’t take it no more I got to score
Raise up, blaze up
Got my mind made up now I’m ready for the change up
Marcus, Martin, Malcolm
We came a long way when they say how come
I tell them it’s
