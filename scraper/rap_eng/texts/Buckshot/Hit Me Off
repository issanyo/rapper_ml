And I see you flossing my way
With the grace all up in my face so I say
"What's up love? How you doing?
What you think about me and you screwin'?"
Naw but wait, let's make a date, plans for dinner
I'm down to take it slow 'cause you know that she's a winner, uhh
Got me feinin' for the cream, don't you know?
I'm movin' in slow but keep it low, low, low
[Mike]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby boo
Yo, what's up with you?
Word around camp is that you like it with two
I wanna freak it, but first I'm gonna take a peak at it
Grab it, stab it, 'cause you know I got's to have it

And the booty's on me
