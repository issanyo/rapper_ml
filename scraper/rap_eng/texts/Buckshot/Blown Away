I got so much trouble on my mind, refuse to lose
But sometimes the flesh get's weak
And I regret the decision I choose
But I'm not trying to sing the blues
Cause life goes on, remembering the verse
Nitty showed me a song
Kept me calm for a minute though
Got me mellow when Juda blaze the Cocoa
But in the back of my mind I still know
I still got a job to do, for real yo
Give thanks for the meal, it's time to peel though
Lick em off, soon be back to build yo
On the bricks side where it's real for sho
But what's really buried deep in the mind, no one knows
My peeps keep me grounded, so my head don't blow
It's a struggle but the more I smoke the more my mind flow

Losing my mind, tryin' to stay high
Everybody fuckin wit me, cuz they know I keep a pound of trees
Cuz I gotta maintain in me
But I'm losing my mind, tryin to stay high
Gotta link with my P.N.C

It's the life of my man who lived for the root of all evil
I can't knock him though, cause we was once consider peoples
We broke bread at the same chicks crib
Two ribs we just roughed up
Gums we just brushed up
I burglarized my first joint playin with stack money
Who motto was "I die for it" quote from Stack Money
Head Capo, cause shots round the Big Apple
Ain't never been no punk, my guns bust directly at you
Would of sworn he was the thoroughest, came through in the prettiest
Big boy Benz, 500-S series
Bumpin' "For the Love of Money" by the group the O'Jays
Spotted the half smoked Philly comin' out the ashtray
I didn't even know, just knew my man Mr. Brown
And I've been linkin up with dunn for 3 months now
Looked at my kiko asked him, which spot he cocked
He returned the death stare, eyes full of blood shot
Try to block it wit a chuckle, hit that shit nigga fuck you
Buck him, pull my coat, just huff on the dust too
Like it's cool to be smokin' on the oolahs
Won't hit the spliff less I see you twist up the buddhas

[Steele]
I'm losing my mind, rollin' my dime
Frame of mind, tryin' to lace my weed
That's a muthafuckin' friend I don't need

[Buckshot]
It's a shame, it's a shame, how you blamed your man
For some shit that you been through, but you don't understand
It's a price to pay, the price when you play the game
If you get up in the game, get hit up in the game
I seen niggas snitch just to come home quick
Money came home, but he got hit
In the bubble whip, with the system in it
One shot, fire two, then burst
Shit that's what happen when you thrust
You think you comin home, but you meetin chrome
You really thought you had the throne, cuz you was the bone
On the block, as the bomb rock, now you
Under a rock, so the money stop
Didn't know the rules of the game so you plan flop
Niggas seein' a vision, tryin' to make it to the top

[Steele]
Now I'm losin my mind, gotta take time
If I wanna roll that weed, cuz you know I gotta roll it in the leaf
Can't fuck with no phillies
I'm losin my mind, smokin my dime
On the lo lo from these
Cuz you know them niggas lookin for me
From some shit back from the 80's
I'm losin my mind, fuckin wit ya niggas one time...

[Unkown]
I just want all yall to keep the faith, and never lose it
Coming straight from the heart
Cause in this game, it's a struggle
But I just want you to keep strong, and move along
