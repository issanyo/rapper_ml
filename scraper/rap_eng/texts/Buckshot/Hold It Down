[Verse 1: Buckshot]
Time flies by
There's so many people trying to make it in the world, so am I
I can't lie, I be on the side like beer
Anything move and I'm there
Soon as I hear money calling I pick up a cell, cautious
Cause my little man in the cell
I can't even tell, what's the set-up, But
Sometimes I don't care I'm dead-up
As soon as I get up I'm prepared
To lockdown the town like I'm the mayor
You know, stocks and shares, not this year
Laid back in the cut, No, not this year
It's a all out brawl out, fall out the line
In my Boot Camp it's a thin line
Who the truth, who lying, who the cat, who lying
Who cock back, who firing? Who the raw, who the cook?
Who shake, who shook? Criminal mind from a crook
A page from a book, motivation from a push, look
It's hard enough being a black man or a brown man
Right now we held down man
And you can tell we in Hell now man
Let's get to Heaven because we Hellbound man
Let's hold it down man...

[Hook: Tyler Woods]
And you know we got to hold it down
I'mma put it on the line
Cause it's my life
And you know
And you know
And you know

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Listening to Donnie Hatha-Way up in his last days
Why he have to pass away so young
While his craft was being mastered
I don't want to ask a question with no answer
But I still fight for the chance to write the cure for cancer
Wipe poverty of the map with a verse and a 9th Wonder track
Am I right? Holla back or is it too ambitious
These dudes too weak or am I too damn vicious
When their hair waves like a magic wand I excite fans
The way I raise my son give you a nice tan
Make him into a man is the rival that's been planned
Bible in the bullets aside of the night stand
You still in the right hand to give justice to a lamb
Still in the wrong hand the shit hit the fan
Blaming the white man, like damn
Obstacles popping up like spam
Whoa, I rap from the view of the black and the brown man
Bar code on the soul so the music can sound scan
Bar code on the soul so the music can sound scan

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
I know time's too slow for you
You're acting like you Ready for the World like the group
Don't do something you might regret
Yeah it's cool that you jog but you like to sweat
On the corner, on your Nike sweats
I'll bet, cops come, I jet, you stay
Cause you still ain't learned but you will today
You going to see how it feels today
To wait for somebody to feed you a meal but hey
Shorty parlez, ain't no rush take your time
I'm at a whole new level with mine
To go further I'd murder the rhyme
And get busy when I'm serving you lines like, this
It's hard enough being a black man or a brown man
Right now we held down man
And you can tell we in hell now man
Let's get to heaven because we hell bound man
Let's hold it down man
