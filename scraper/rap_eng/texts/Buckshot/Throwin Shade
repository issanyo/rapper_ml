[Intro/Sample]
Fill er' up, Fill er' up
Fill er' up, Fill er' up
And I have myself a beat

[Verse 1]
7'o'clock when I'm wide awake
Thinking of the journey I decided to take
Got a call from Cheryl, she the kind with cake
But not in the oven but work them other she shake
Like shorty said everything was cool with the kid
But she had a man who foolin' in the bed
Any kind of big, any kind of whip
Pull up to the crib he be like yo who dis?
Nah
That's not the way I roll
You better off trying to play lotto
She set it off ya every day I know
Her nickname is Cleo
Got game like Rio
See ya!
With all that baggage
You a bad miss, but I can't have this
Last kid that fell for that shit
Got clapped in the back
Is over that's it it's a wrap!
I don't want to hear dis and that about
This chatter about
Miss what's that about
I seen you on a Sunday
This ain't even one day
Even on a Monday?

[Hook]
If you wanna slick
I know the kind
Thinkin you the shit
Well that's fine
Lookin' at the watch
I see the time
Shorty is crazy
She's shady

[Verse 2]
Always cell like damn
Me and my man just broke up
Come to the crib
Fam let's smoke up
Cool with you, fine with me
Brought the ol' wind of pocket and the nine with me cuz
These niggas'll flip like pancakes
Play the friend role and go man I can't take it!
Naked
She got him enticed
Man he's jealous when I come through bald and like
Go d from the mack react like fuck that
If I can't hit that he gonna skip that
Yeah?
Well hear this click-clack
In the area while buck just sit back
And the shots get thrown back and that don't match
Yeah I'm wild nigga but don't condone that
Fucking with the bird and all that luggage
It get you caught up like a bird in an oven
Yeah she bustin'
Cuz everyone know that hit
Every weekend pretend like she know shit
See those tricks?
I got a treat for that
No beats still leaking your tracks believe that

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
