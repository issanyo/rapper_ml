[Verse 1: Talib Kewli]
Once upon a time in a land far-far away, I tried to play but my heart in the way
This part a little harder to say, it's like the white girl trapped in a well
Help is coming but it's scary as hell but very well, here went the fairy tale
Now Cinderella want a fella who is not so ghetto
So she follow bread crumbs like Hansel and Gretel
Hello, that'll make her drop her underwear, dough longer than Rapunzel hair
Everyone stare when she walk in, she like what you want?
Yo, I'm not gonna front, I'll be blunt, I'll make that ass bump
I know that's what they want, me too with my hands up
She turned around like man up, I'm like here I am
But I know her from work, she pass by like he ain't that fly
You got one more chance to fall down the rabbit hole
Let me take you to Wonderland or I'm making some other plans

[Hook: Outasight]
I don't wanna spend the night
Trying to figure out how to spend my life
I don't wanna spend my time waiting for you, waiting for you
I don't wanna spend the night
Trying to figure out how to spend my life
I don't wanna spend my time waiting for you, waiting for you

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
I made you a star, your light was shining and so bright
So bright that it dwarfed the chicks like Snow White
So nice, got down with the team and now you one of us
Got me singing like Prince, you sexy motherfuck
You could be my princess bride, call you my buttercup
I love when you letting me be the man
Let me take you by the hand like Wendy in Peter Pan
If you fly by night, that's right, I'll let you make a wish
Eat you up like a favorite dish, man I pray you not the Wicked Witch
Made it through a situation where I broke my promise
But now, I'm trying to be honest love, so can you
Sometimes people evolve but that involves knowing exactly what you want
And right now, I want a compromise by giving your partner what they want
My life is an open book, you had a chapter but will it end happily ever after?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Life ain't a fairy tale
Now they say sister's bitter and the brothers is grim
Time to let the story end and let another begin
I spun straw into gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Still a hole in my soul that love won't fill in
She Sleeping Beauty cause her eyes was closed
Tried to sleep on your boy like Brian Rose
Now she wild like the coke in your nose
And I'm lying like Pinocchio, gotta know when it's time to go
Gotta know when it's, here we are, we had some good times
Had some Little Red Riding Hood times but once again
I'm the big bad wolf, don't hit me with the sad look love
Here I am, I'm still the same old me
But I don't know if we should give it one more chance
To add another chapter, life ain't always happily ever after

[Hook]
