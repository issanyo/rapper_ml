(Intro- Booby Brackins)
Let me see you twerk twerk twerk…

(Chorus- Bobby Brackins)
I see you showin out
Lookin at yo body going wild
And every time I see you twerking out
Go crazy, baby
Let me see you twerk twerk twerk
I’m gonna see you twerk twerk twerk
Let me see you twerk twerk twerk
Til the sun come up (3

(Verse 1- Bobby Brackins)
Girl don’t hurt yo body
‘Cus you movin so fast like a Maserati
Goddamn girl you can get
The way you shake yo ass girl I’m hatin'
Keep twerkin'
And move it side to side like you’re swerving
Got a couple dollars, is it worth it?
If you bust it wide open, I’mma murk it
The way you movin yo body girl i can tell you can ride it
I gotta pick a Barcadi, and be the life of the party
So put yo hands on yo mizzy, and let your back bend
I can see what you’re doing through these ray bands

(Chorus)

(Verse 2- John Hart)
I’mma get er
Shit, never met a nigga that’s realer
Say she got a boyfriend, but I’mma steal er
‘Cus with a ass like that she a killer
Show me that it’s real girl
How you clappin' that shit girl
Just keep it trill, girl
Might get a mill, girl
Nope, no happy meals, girl
Let's make a deal, girl
I be on Instagram, cuz I want you
You and your  friends can come through
I got bottles on deck with the smoke too
I’ve gotta pole at the crib, yall can get loose
My name John Hart, I go crazy
No niggas, all ladies
I got rappers, so no babies
Goddamn your ass goin' crazy

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
You’re body’s so crazy, you’re losing control
The way that you twerkin', I can’t let you go
I see you (oh oh oh)
I see you (oh oh oh)
I see you (oh oh oh)
I see you workin, now twerk it, girl

(Chorus)
