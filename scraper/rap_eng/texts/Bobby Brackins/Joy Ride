[Intro]
Let me see you!

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Jaw might drop when you see her
Mean it when I say "I love you, boo"
Might spent a little bit when I see you
So you know that the love is true
My baby gon' handle it
My baby bring another chick
You, you know
My baby gon' handle it
Ey baby, joy ride the stick

[Verse 1: Bobby Brackins]
All eyes on you, girl, tell me how you want me
Have you ever rolled a 5x5, honey?
Wanna joy ride it, put that on somethin'
What's your boyfriend got on me, baby? Nothin'
Enough of the discussion, give me head like a concussion
When it come to cars, I'mma buy about a dozen
We can switch it up, pretty baby, when you joy ride in
Top coming off when you sit in my Benz

[Pre-Chorus: Austin Mahone]
But sugar, sugur baby, she's a star (She's a star)
Joy ridin' while we in and out the car (Joy ride)

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Jaw might drop when you see her
Mean it when I say "I love you, boo"
Might spent a little bit when I see you
So you know that the love is true
My baby gon' handle it
My baby bring another chick
You, you know
My baby gon' handle it
Ey baby, joy ride the stick, ooh ah
Joy ride my body
Joy ride my body
Joy ride my body
Joy ride it, baby

[Verse 2: Bobby Brackins]
Joy ride it, speaking my language
Girl, we can mess around on a bay bridge
Joy ride it, pretty baby, like a spaceship
Ah you can joy ride it like we racin'
And you can ride fast like a Geico
You can swing that thing like a sideshow
Got them balls, baby, I'm from Oakland
You can joy ride it like you stole me

[Pre-Chorus: Austin Mahone]
But sugar, sugur baby, she's a star (She's a star)
Joy ridin' while we in and out the car (Joy ride)

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Jaw might drop when you see her
Mean it when I say "I love you, boo"
Might spent a little bit when I see you
So you know that the love is true
My baby gon' handle it
My baby bring another chick
You, you know
My baby gon' handle it
Ey baby, joy ride the stick, ooh ah
Joy ride my body
Joy ride my body
Joy ride, joy ride it, baby
