[Verse 1]
I’m finna pop like a pistol
Shoot like a missile
She don’t touch meth but my broad got crystals
I’ma get the Henn and [?] like a nigga
I’ma lick it up and latch on like a pitbull
Been riding here ‘til see the dawn
That’s why they give me dawn
I can make a star out a girl you never seen before
Baby bring the tree to roll
I'm breaded like a pita roll
Must have false started
Cause I thought they told me to go
She gon’ be home home late cause she’s fucking with me
Ride or die chick, let me ride with a piece
Next 12 months, girl I pay you out your lease
If you keep fucking me for the rest of the week

[Chorus]
They shooting
Every time I come around they lose it
I’ma have to fuck around, go stupid
Where the roof go? I removed it

[Chorus]
They shooting
Every time I come around they lose it
I’ma have to fuck around, go stupid
Where the roof go? I removed it

[Verse 2]
I’m not the type of nigga to die from old age
Live fast, die young, RIP to Cobain
Cruisin’ in the slow lane
[?] show my peaceful
Pass around the Uber
It’ll Kill Bill, so lethal
So up with my people
She naked under [?]
Born in 96 so baby girl is legal
Take the bra off
Top off the [?]
Must have false started
Cause I thought they told me to go
A lot of bitches playing, never been to the east
She might steal a key ‘cause she won’t wanna leave
Trip to Palm Springs for the rest of the week
I got places to go and people to see

[Chorus]
They shooting
Every time I come around they lose it
I’ma have to fuck around, go stupid
Where the roof go? I removed it

[Chorus]
They shooting
Every time I come around they lose it
I’ma have to fuck around, go stupid
Where the roof go? I removed it
