[Intro: Wash]
Do you want to come back to the crib with me?
Do you want to come back to the crib with me?

[Verse 1: Wash]
I fucked you once, a last bit of love
You’ll never feel so comfortable
I’m cashing out, I bought you a show
Ain’t tricking if you fucking too
Fucking with me
Do you want get on?
Baby do you want to get known?
Want to get blown
Go deep in the field
We could buy weed or pop pills
Do you like dro? Like playing with your nose?
I wanna do that with the hoes
And I got a big house
Gon eat that thing out
Baby we could dip if you’re down down down

[Chorus: Wash]
Do you want to come back to the crib with me?
Do you want to come back to the crib with me?
Do you want to come back to the crib with me?
Do you want to come back to the crib with me?

[Verse 2: Bobby Brackins]
Baby I’ma spend this money then I’ma make it back
House on the hills, baby I’ma take you back
Like two hands, baby you should make it clap
Can you make me nut when I bust like a gat
My niggas really mobbing, yeah they came with the strap
Niggas always copy, man I swear my phone’s tapped
So fucking genius, I star in my own act
Show me all the girls that’ll really come back

[Chorus: Wash]
Do you want to come back to the crib with me?
Do you want to come back to the crib with me?
Do you want to come back to the crib with me?
Do you want to come back to the crib with me?

[Verse 3: Bobby Brackins]
Let’s go back to the crib
You know that I’m fucking with you baby
Get it in a padded room
Cause you know I’m fucking you crazy
I might charge these other girls
But tonight you won’t have to pay me
Let’s go right to the crib
Girl I want you to know where I’m staying

[Chorus: Wash]
Do you want to come back to the crib with me?
Do you want to come back to the crib with me?
Do you want to come back to the crib with me?
Do you want to come back to the crib with me?
