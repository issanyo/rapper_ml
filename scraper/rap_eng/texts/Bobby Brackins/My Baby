[Chorus]
We should've listened to each other's hearts
Fall in love and never part
We can make it happen, if you 'bout that action
Now here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby
Now here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby

[Verse 1]
Still we beat, that's how I'm feelin'
Let 'em know we in the buildin'
From the floor up to the ceilin'
If you 'bout, it let's start chillin'
Doing movement, we can party
Who’s in our business? Everybody
But it’s alright, cause I’m still living
Like 2 Chainz, baby, I’m different
Come here now

[Pre-Chorus]
Lemme tell you little somethin', little somethin'
That you might wanna know 'bout me
I don’t play no game, baby, listen
Baby, if you love me then come show me

[Chorus]
We should've listened to each other's hearts
Fall in love and never part
We can make it happen, if you 'bout that action
Now here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby
Now here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby

[Verse 2]
Darling, we should take a ride
Cruise, and flirting while we drive
Nothing could come kill our vibe
Got no worries on my mind
Now we’re living, living good
Young and misunderstood
Got me trippin', you drive me crazy
You know you wanna be my baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Lemme tell you little somethin', little somethin'
That you might wanna know 'bout me
I don’t play no game, baby, listen
Baby, if you love me then come show me

[Chorus]
We should've listened to each other's hearts
Fall in love and never part
We can make it happen, if you 'bout that action
Now here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby
Now here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby

[Bridge]
Even though I'm on the grind
Think about you all the time
Now I know that you're the one
Let's have fun, have fun while we young

[Chorus]
We should've listened to each other's hearts
Fall in love and never part
We can make it happen, if you 'bout that action
Now here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby
Now here we go again, here we go again
You know you wanna be my baby
