[Verse 1: Mila J]
My baby we with the shit
My baby gon' ride or die
My baby gon' keep it lit
My baby don't care my high
He thinks he's my ex doin' hurt
But I love my new boo
Lookin' so thirsty, got nothin' to lose
My new thing can talk that shit
My new thing backs it up

[Hook]
He wants for us, you'd hold me, now you try, a lonely
You lookin' sorry now my niggas, it's all good, we all good
You lookin' sorry now my bitches, it's all good
We all good, you lookin' sorry now

[Verse 2: Bobby Brackins]
I drop a barbery, drop a head
Quick up one night and I drop yo chin
Back to yo house, you can have it real
Call up boo thing when I rob yo think
I'm a real one, baby, not one to diss
Smashed off with ten niggas in the industry
And that's just nice, make you my wife
Damn cost me how to wraps, how to spend the night
I know just then I wish we'd be just friends
I ain't mad at you, baby, but you can't win
Doesn't wow so hard, we just wanna party
Ya thirsty fame and now you lookin' shawty

[Hook]
He wants for us, you'd hold me, now you try, a lonely
You lookin' sorry now my niggas, it's all good
You lookin' sorry now my bitches, it's all good
We all good, you lookin' sorry now

[Bridge]
My ex, my ex, still love me
Like popo, he straight wanna cuff me
It's too late, I got a new boo
Progress, I feel sorry for you

[Hook]
He wants for us, you'd hold me, now you try, a lonely
You lookin' sorry now my niggas, it's all good, we all good
You lookin' sorry now my bitches, it's all good
We all good, you lookin' sorry now
