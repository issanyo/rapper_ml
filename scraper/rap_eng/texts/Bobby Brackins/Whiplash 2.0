[Intro: Bobby Brackins]
Give 'em whiplash

[Verse 1: Bobby Brackins]
What it do? I see you're fond of me, baby
I ain't been good, now that's honesty, baby
You the baddest in the room, speaking honestly, baby
You know you hot, a commodity, abby
First send the pics and some vids to me, baby
I like when you drunk send them clips to me, baby
You should start a [?] show on the 5-80
Girl you're such a big fan, I'ma make you my baby, oh
And just in case you didn't know
You give 'em whiplash, quick, fast when I'm on the road
[?] should go, woah, that's some [?]
Bring a couple girl friends and we could have some fun with 'em

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy & Bobby Brackins]
Whiplash
Ooh ya give 'em whiplash
Yeah ya give 'em whiplash (give 'em whiplash)
Ooh ya give 'em whiplash
Yeah ya give 'em whiplash (give 'em whiplash)

[Verse 2: Marc E. Bassy]
Double tappin' on the photo
Cup sip from my cup, you'll be lean like a
Got me feelin' slow mo' in the six deuce
Oh we caught up in the cut, [?] I cut that ass loose, yeah
Don't tell a soul, that's a gift to me, baby
When I'm out there on the road, send them pics to me, baby
You finessed my code to my phone, bitch you crazy
But I wonder how you did this shit, you always did amaze me
You supply [?]
Momma's on your money, wonder how far you would go
Got 'em up but acting like the [?]
Big ass, walk past, girl you already know

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy & Bobby Brackins]
Give 'em whiplash
Ooh ya give 'em whiplash
Yeah ya give 'em whiplash (give 'em whiplash)
Ooh ya give 'em whiplash
Yeah ya give 'em whiplash (give 'em whiplash)

[Verse 3: P-LO]
Oh wee, yeah this verse for you, baby
When I'm down, lay with me, got a [?] for you, baby
Them bands so soft like Nerf for me, baby
You way too bad, made it worse for me, baby
When I wake, let me fuck with it, baby
Not blind, your hands got a touch with it, baby
Trophy outside, gotta stunt with you, baby
You like girls too, on a hunt with you, baby, yeah

[Bridge: Bobby Brackins]
Give 'em whiplash
Baby like why she so bad?
Drink and she only smoke gas
Give 'em whiplash
[?] she hope you don't crash
She be turnin' heads when she pass

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy & Bobby Brackins]
Give 'em whiplash
Ooh ya give 'em whiplash
Yeah ya give 'em whiplash (give 'em whiplash)
Ooh ya give 'em whiplash
Yeah ya give 'em whiplash (give 'em whiplash)
