[Intro]

[Hook: Marc Griffin]
I knew from the start, she was ready
Baby girl's a star, she's so ready
Make her love me cause I'm hot right now
We can just leave, don't talk right now
If she say
I'm ready, I'm I'm ready baby yeah
I'm ready, I'm I'm ready baby yeah
I'm ready, I'm I'm ready baby
Baby come and get me if you're ready to go

[Verse 1: Bobby Brackins]
She's da digging me heavy
She wants to rock steady
Prolly gone beat like the trunk of a chevy
I'm raw like the red meat
At the party like confetti
Girl get on your marks, get set, get ready!
And we can get it on
We ain't gotta stay girl
We can get gone
Head to the club--while driving
I'd like to get head to the club
Bring a bed to the club
So we can make love in the club
Pop bub in the club
Never been petty
This a club banger that's radio ready
And I can rock ya world, go hard if ya let me
Don't waste no time my boothang ready

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bobby Brackins]
She ready to go, looking like she really wants the big deal, Universal
Girl I signed a big deal
We riding
Riding on big wheels
We rolling
Spinning like them windmills
If I put it on ya prepare, get ready
We can hit the telly "143" to my celly
I date hot ones
My girl's got buns
And when it comes to the trees, we keep tons
Get paper like refunds
Burn paper till the tree's done
On TV like a re-run
Cha cha cha choosing
I know you ready
Honey, who you fooling?
Nobody!

[Hook]

[Bridge: Marc Griffin and Bobby Brackins]

You turn me on sweet baby
Come come along, oh come along, sexy you drive me crazy

Sexin and rockin steady
Oooh girl you look so ready!

[Hook]
