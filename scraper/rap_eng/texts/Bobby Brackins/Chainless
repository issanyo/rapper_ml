[Verse 1]
Oh, how ya feel, when I come through
Looking so fly, prettier than your bitch?
Ain't gotta try, to catch a niggas eye
I'll take your man like aye ho, watch this!
I'm not lookin' at you tryna live it up just doin' my own thing
So hot , what you gon do?
Pop another bottle boy, fill up my drink

[Hook] (x2)
Throw it in the bag, rip the tag, what's good?
Making bitches mad cause I'm bad, what's good?
Get money out of fools, shameless, what's good?
Got nothing to lose, chainless, what's good?

[Chorus]
And if we die tonight at least we went hard
Yeah there's no better time to give all we've got
We're livin', we-we-we're livin'
We're livin'. I'm on like a mu'fucka
We're livin', we-we-we're livin'
We're livin' I'm on like a mu'fucka
I'm chainless as a mu'fucka, right now
I'll slap a skank bitch in the face right now
I'm faded as a mu'fucka right now
I'm feelin' myself gettin' paid right now

[Verse 2]
Feel me, I know, you see it
Ready, let's go, I need it , I need it

[Hook] (x2)
Throw it in the bag, rip the tag, what's good?
Making bitches mad cuz I'm bad, what's good?
Get money out of fools, shameless, what's good?
Got nothing to lose, chainless, what's good?

[Chorus]
And if we die tonight at least we went hard
Yeah there's no better time to give all we've got
We're livin', we-we-we're livin'
We're livin'. I'm on like a mu'fucka
We're livin', we-we-we're livin'
We're livin' I'm on like a mu'fucka
I'm chainless as a mu'fucka, right now
I'll slap a skank bitch in the face right now
I'm faded as a mu'fucka right now
I'm feelin' myself gettin' paid right now
