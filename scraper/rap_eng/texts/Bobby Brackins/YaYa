[Verse 1: Bobby Brackins]
Finally in the sun town baby
I been waiting for this
Kiss you in some new places baby
I go dumb when I lick
Have you wet up, I’m towning lately
You should read up on this
Heard you attracted to genius baby
You won’t mind pretty kids

[Pre-Hook: Bobby Brackins]
I just want some equity, I ain’t tripping off rims
But I still put the matte black on the winds
And everything I took, hold on should’ve bought to some tip
A stolen piece of property, yeah your girl about to whip
Off her drawers like the lightskin, throw ‘em on the drawer
Better [?] your tints ‘cause we got a massive sport
Katy Perry with this shit, I can make you roar
Don’t tell your man, just unlock the back door

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
I’m coming through for the yaya, I’m coming through

Like girl I’m coming through, I’m coming through

Better [?] your tints ‘cause we got a massive sport
Katy Perry with this shit, I can make you roar
Don’t tell your man, just unlock the back door

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
