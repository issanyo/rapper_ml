[Verse 1]
Oh, you all over me
All over me, baby, you all over me
500 degrees
500 degrees, you hot as 500 degrees
You all over me
All over me, baby, you all over me
You all over me, all over me

[Chorus]
My baby's underneath
Underneath the sheets
Underneath the sheets, underneath the sheets
Underneath the sheets, ooh woah
Now you're dripping on me
Dripping on me underneath the sheets
Now you're loving on me
Loving on me underneath the sheets
Now you're dripping on me
Dripping on me underneath the sheets
Now you're loving on me
Loving on me, underneath the sheets, woah

[Verse 2]
E mobbin' with me
Mobbin' with me, baby, he mobbin' with me
600 degrees
600 degrees, hot like 600 degrees
All over me, baby, he's all over me
All over me

[Chorus]
My baby's underneath
Underneath the sheets
Underneath the sheets, underneath the sheets
Underneath the sheets, ooh woah
Now you're dripping on me
Dripping on me underneath the sheets
Now you're loving on me
Loving on me underneath the sheets
Now you're dripping on me
Dripping on me underneath the sheets
Now you're loving on me
Loving on me, underneath the sheets, woah
