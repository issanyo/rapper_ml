[Verse 1]
Your hubby, he on my line
He want me, two nickles makes a dime
Duct tape on a forty
Feeling good, baby, what it do?
I brought another homie
What's good, baby? Get on too

[Pre-Chorus]
Make it pop, make it pop; baby, what it do?
Don't stop, don't stop; baby, want it too?
Cause I'm lust with you
So in lust with you
Make it pop, make it pop; baby, what it do?
Don't stop, don't stop; baby, want it too?
Cause I'm in lust with you
I just wanna fuck with you

[Chorus]
I know you want to too
I just wanna fuck with you
I know you want to too
I just wanna fuck with you
I know you want to too
I just wanna fuck with you
I know you want to too
I just wanna fuck with you

[Verse 2]
Hey baby, you know I ride
We all out, they all inside
Turned up and I'm loaded
Act up, make the front page news
Duck tape on a forty
Feeling good, baby, what it do?

[Pre-Chorus]
Make it pop, make it pop; baby, what it do?
Don't stop, don't stop; baby, want it too?
Cause I'm lust with you
So in lust with you
Make it pop, make it pop; baby, what it do?
Don't stop, don't stop; baby, want it too?
Cause I'm in lust with you
I just wanna fuck with you

[Chorus]
I know you want to too
I just wanna fuck with you
I know you want to too
I just wanna fuck with you
I know you want to too
I just wanna fuck with you
I know you want to too
I just wanna fuck with you

[Bridge]
I got a candy-painted coupe
We made it, baby, ooh
Came through with my pretty ladies too
To teach you a thing or two
I fuck with you
And I'm faded, ooh
When I hit you up, you gon' call me back
Cause it's mutual

[Chorus]
I know you want to too
I just wanna fuck with you
I know you want to too
I just wanna fuck with you
I know you want to too
I just wanna fuck with you
I know you want to too
I just wanna fuck with you

[Outro]
I know you want to too
I know you want to too
I know you want to too
I know you want to too
