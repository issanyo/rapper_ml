[Intro: PnB Rock & Bobby Brackins]
Hit me up and tap in tap, in
Hit me up and tap in ya
Hit me up and tap in

[Verse: PnB Rock]
With a little baby
She be going brazy
She ride me like a Mercedes
Something like the 80's
She just wanna taste me
She gon back that thang up
And then she gon face me
She say she ain't like these other bitches they so basic
She say pull the Lamb out
She just wanna race me
I say girl you crazy
This money all I'm chasing
Headed to the bank now
You should see my statements
Did another show now
You should see my payments
[?]
Vvs's on my wrist
She sippin bubbly I'ma sip fine
Hit me up and tap in when when you in my town

[Chorus: PnB Rock & Bobby Brackins]
Hit me up and tap in
Hit me up and tap in tap, in
Hit me up and tap in
Hit me up and tap in
Hit me up and tap in
Hit me up and tap in tap, in
Hit me up and tap in
Hit me up and tap in

[Verse: Bobby Brackins]
Don't forget to hear my phone now
You be the one I hold down
Rolling up that dumb loud
The money ought to slow down
Yeah I got your name saved next to your city
Whenever you in Cali
Come and fuck with me I be down in LA
She know I'm from the bay
She giving good brain
Cos she graduated state
Babe getting cake now
Automatic pay
[?] down on melrose
Shout out to the bank
[?]
Michelin stars [?]
I'm the one she wanna see now
Hit me up and tap in when you in my town

[Chorus: PnB Rock & Bobby Brackins]
Hit me up and tap in
Hit me up and tap in tap, in
Hit me up and tap in
Hit me up and tap in
Hit me up and tap in
Hit me up and tap in tap, in
Hit me up and tap in
Hit me up and tap in
