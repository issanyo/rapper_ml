(Verse 1)
Gotta give a shout out
To the stunners in the building
To the bitches i'm feeling, sexual healing
For the broads thats killing, go hard no chilling
Gotta give a shout out
To the sexy bartenders
Who fuck with winners
Pros no not beginners
I'm gripping these rockstar tities
Racks, racks, follow stacks
I'm sipping on an aloe beverage
Pulling these hoes give me leverage
Balling like the PAC 10
The name's Bobby Brackins!
I gotta give a shout out
To the mamacitas i'm peepin'
Party hard gotta sleep in
Don't catch your girlfriend creeping
Boo thing probably cheating
Shout out if you live good baby
Sh-sh-shout out if you live-live-live-live-live good

(Hook)
Shout out to these bottles
Shout out to this bomb weed
Shout out to this bad bitch that's jumping all up on me
Shout out to this money
Shout out to the homies
No shout out to the police
Fuck you to my enemies
We gon' pour up
Drinks for everyone who showed up, yeah
Then we gon' roll up
Tell everybody really, so what?
This for you (X8)
Shout out

(Verse 2)
Shout out to everybody geeked up
The hustlers that re-up
B to the D cups
Don't fizzle with 2 cups
Give head like crew cuts
Gotta give a shout out
To everyone that act like themselves
Dare to be different don't try to be nobody else
Gotta give a shout out
To sexy girls that hook up with they friends
Curious lesbians take a ride in the benz
Gotta give a shout out
To the strippers and the rebels
Boss in the hills to the drops in the ghetto
Blow money, live fast real hard
Do it big, ball out a real star
Let everybody know who you are
We pop bottles and we buy out the bar

(Hook)
Shout out to these bottles
Shout out to this bomb weed
Shout out to this bad bitch that's jumping all up on me
Shout out to this money
Shout out to the homies
No shout out to the police
Fuck you to my enemies
We gon' pour up
Drinks for everyone who showed up, yeah
Then we gon' roll up
Tell everybody really, so what?
This for you (X8)
Shout out

(Bridge)
To all the boys and girls
That request me on the radio station
Shout out, to all the DJ's
That's spinning me in heavy rotation
Shout out, to all the freaky girls
That'll do something strange for a piece of change
Ball out, like you won the lotto
And live it up like it ain't no tomorrow
Shout out

(Hook)
Shout out to these bottles
Shout out to this bomb weed
Shout out to this bad bitch that's jumping all up on me
Shout out to this money
Shout out to the homies
No shout out to the police
Fuck you to my enemies
We gon' pour up
Drinks for everyone who showed up, yeah
Then we gon' roll up
Tell everybody really, so what?
This for you (X8)
Shout out
