[Verse 1]
With no makeup on and your eyelash hanging
I would still love you
If you came home late and you kept me waiting
I would still trust you
If the richer man was looking at you
Would you stay cold as a statue?
Would my love still be good for you?

[Chorus]
Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' , mornin'?
Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' mornin'?
Would you stay here from the sunset to the sunrise?
When I open up both eyes
Be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin'

[Verse 2]
If I pass out drunk and you check my message
And see my exes
Would you still believe that it's only just us
And I'm not reckless?
Would you know if I ever laid with another lover?
We was on a break, babe and I wore a rubber
Would you forgive me?

[Chorus]
Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' , mornin'?
Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' , mornin'?
Would you stay here from the sunset to the sunrise?
When I open up both eyes
Be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin'

[Verse 3]
And last night, last night
I dreamed of a woman
Dark brown eyes
Daddy told her all she knows
She brought me to life
She set my soul in motion
And there's only one thing that I gotta know

[Chorus]
Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' , mornin'?
Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' , mornin'?
Would you stay here from the sunset to the sunrise?
When I open up both eyes
Be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin'
