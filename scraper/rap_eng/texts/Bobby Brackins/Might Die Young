[Verse 1: Bobby Brackins]
I'm going 17 every year
East Oakland boy
But my bitches think I'm cavalier
Been quick giving a fuck
Many months ago
In a room plotting but it's not hookah smoke
Have a drink and we smoking dope
Spend the same on the drugs just to be your [?]
You could meet my plug, he got summer snow
If your girl friends need summer snow
But where we 'bout to go
You won't have no worries
We all good
Baby you should see my [?]
[?]
So give me brain
Girl you know I love knowledge

[Chorus: Tinashe]
You fuck me too
I got that good type of love to make your heart go numb
You love me too
We've been going so hard, I think we might die young, oh
You fuck me too
I got that good type of love to make your heart go numb
You love me too
Let's get it poppin' right now in case we might die young

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
Miss me baby, you down for me
Tell me why you keep lyin' to me?
Bullshit that you been writin' me
Seems like you ain't really tryna meet
Three hoes betcha didn't fuckin' know
Three nights better been all alone
Every night, I remember when I, ooh
Life's short, I believe it
Can't help the way I'm feelin'
Fuck with me, I need you (need you)
Fuck with me, I need you (need you)

[Chorus: Tinashe & Olivia O'Brien]
You fuck me too
I got that good type of love to make your heart go numb
(go numb)
You love me too
We've been going so hard, I think we might die young, (die young)
Oh you fuck me too
I got that good type of love to make your heart go numb
(go numb)
You love me too
Let's get it poppin' right now in case we might die young

[Verse 3: Olivia O'Brien]
Tryna go out, make a big film
When it come to this baby I kill
Gotta make sure my glass stay filled
I ain't even sure none of this real
Out the window why the fuck you mess with me, yeah
When I'm out, everybody fuck with me, yeah
Where I'm at, you know that's the place to be, yeah
Come thru pop some, you can see it
Tequila in my wine
You know I'm feeling fine
That's how I spend my time
Never too much, I can't get enough, yeah

[Chorus: Tinashe & Olivia O'Brien]
You fuck me too
I got that good type of love to make your heart go numb
(go numb)
You love me too
We've been going so hard, I think we might die young, (die young)
Oh you fuck me too
I got that good type of love to make your heart go numb
(go numb)
You love me too
Let's get it poppin' right now in case we might die young

[Outro: Olivia O'Brien]
Die young, die young, oh
Let's get it poppin' right now in case we might die young
Let's get it poppin' right now in case we might die young
