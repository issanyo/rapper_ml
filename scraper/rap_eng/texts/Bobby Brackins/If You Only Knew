[Verse 1: Bobby Brackins]
Anything that
I bet I can supply
We been through some shit
You’re my ride or die
Glad we’re still alive
And you’re so delicious baby
I love the taste
Of getting [?] kisses baby

[Pre-Hook: Bobby Brackins]
I’ll show you some places
You might want to go too
If you didn’t know girl
Then I’m finna show you

[Hook: Mina]
If you only knew
How much I do, do love you
You know I got you baby
If you only knew
How much I do, do love you
You know I got you baby

[Verse 2: Bobby Brackins]
Blowing up my tree
Sexy getting high
I had you on the beach
On castles in the sky
Girl you know you fly
I’ll pay your tuition baby
Legs in the air
I love that position baby

[Pre-Hook: Bobby Brackins]
I’ll show you some places
You just might want to go too
If you’re in no good
Then I’m finna gonna show you

[Hook: Mina]
If you only knew
How much I do, do love you
You know I got you baby
If you only knew
How much I do, do love you
You know I got you baby

[Verse 3: Mina]
If you only knew
The things that I done for you
I’d do some shit for you
I’d even do some time
I sit and think sometimes
About how much I love you
I swear I got you baby

[Hook: Mina]
If you only knew
How much I do, do love you
You know I got you baby
If you only knew
How much I do, do love you
You know I got you baby
