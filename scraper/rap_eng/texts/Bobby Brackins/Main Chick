[Intro]
That my main chick, that my main
That my main chick, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
That my main chick, that my main bitch
Got a couple on the side that I hang with
That my main chick, that my main bitch
Got a couple on the side that I hang with
But you the one, baby, you the one
Only one that know where I'm coming from
But you the one, baby, you the one
Only one that know where I'm coming from

[Verse 1]
I was on the sidelines, I didn't wanna try
You the only one that made me want a better life
All these people, they don't know what it's been like
Tryna come up on the other side
But if I say it, then I did it
I'ma always stay committed
Let's share this cancer stick
Grinding on me like a dancer bitch
You the only text I'm answering

[Chorus]
That my main chick, that my main bitch
Got a couple on the side that I hang with
That my main chick, that my main bitch
Got a couple on the side that I hang with
But you the one, baby, you the one
Only one that know where I'm coming from
But you the one, baby, you the one
Only one that know where I'm coming from

[Verse 2]
Like woo, lover, lover
I be like Shaggy every time I get in trouble
She caught me banging on the counter, it wasn't me
Saw me banging on the sofa, it wasn't me
Even caught me on camera
But you know the answer, she was just a dancer

[Chorus]
That my main chick, that my main bitch
Got a couple on the side that I hang with
That my main chick, that my main bitch
Got a couple on the side that I hang with
But you the one, baby, you the one
Only one that know where I'm coming from
But you the one, baby, you the one
Only one that know where I'm coming from

[Bridge]
Yeah, you're my
A couple on the side
Couple on the side

[Chorus]
That my main chick, that my main bitch
Got a couple on the side that I hang with
That my main chick, that my main bitch
Got a couple on the side that I hang with
But you the one, baby, you the one
Only one that know where I'm coming from
But you the one, baby, you the one
Only one that know where I'm coming from
