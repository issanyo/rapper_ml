Spin the bottle bottle ottle
So fly, like a top model
Spin the bottle
Going for a Kiss
I hope your lips follow
Spin the bottle
Bubbly, tonight you might get lucky
Spin the bottle (baby) x2

A Kiss from a friend, makin his rounds
Spinnin and spinnin, takin you down
Call em all over, group of my friend
Gather around, get em all in

Come to have a real good time
Turn the music up
Baby dim those ligthts, hear the bass
Take your turn boy, jump up and play
Let? s get it poppin, before it? s too late
Go crazy let? s start losing control
I brought my girls os let? s take it low
Make a toast, play a game that can bring us close
