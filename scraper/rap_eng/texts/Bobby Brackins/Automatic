[Verse 1: Shoffy]
Come a little closer
I wanna enter your world
See things, how you see em girl
Moment stands still
I know we both feel
That we should embrace what's in sight

[Pre-Chorus: Shoffy]
You make me automatic
Your moves are so exotic
You know you got me
You know, you know, you know

[Chorus: Shoffy]
I've been thinking lately
So many ordinary people in this world I see
There's not a lot of fantasy
But you are, but you are
The one I'd like to get to know
And let all my emotions flow
You are

[Verse 2: Shoffy]
You got all my attention
I love moving with you
We got nothing to lose
So much to see here
When you are so near
The world shines in a different light

[Pre-Chorus: Shoffy]
You make me automatic
Your moves are so exotic
You know you got me
You know, you know, you know

[Chorus: Shoffy]
I've been thinking lately
So many ordinary people in this world I see
There's not a lot of fantasy
But you are, but you are
The one I'd like to get to know
And let all my emotions flow
You are

[Verse 3: Bobby Brackins]
Baby you should stay late
Go home a day late
Maybe move in
Never have to vacay
King size to lay on
Good tree to blaze on
Yeah I'm the one that put the whole new bay on
Keep a little bling on
Brand new ring on
Different colors like kaleidescopes
Balling like a pick and role
To the top we finna go
Vitamins and minerals
Good thing im good for ya
If you ain't notice baby girl i am a factor
We on the same page just open the next chapter
Got that good reception
We ain't having no static
Don't have to reload
My pimping is automatic
Sex game is full equipped
No need for apparatus
Let's take this show to Vegas
Hey baby we making magic
Hey ma, I'm from east Oakland
This making shit is a habit
You want it girl, you can have it
I'll see to you is the baddest

[Chorus: Shoffy]
I've been thinking lately
So many ordinary people in this world I see
There's not a lot of fantasy
But you are, but you are
The one I'd like to get to know
And let all my emotions flow
Oh You are
