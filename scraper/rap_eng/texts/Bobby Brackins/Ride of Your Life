[Intro]
Metro Boomin want some more nigga

[Verse 1]
Might change your life
I be doing shit that might change your life
Oh, yeah, no lie, no hype
I been doing shit these hoes don't like
Oh yeah, we driving fast in the slow lane
And I do them stunts like a movie
We be on jet's, a Jacuzzi
And we busting off like a uzi
Yeah, I be on the block with shawty
Going extra hard, yeah we just might OD
Need a re-up, we connect with a homie
Every time I call it; pull up on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, and I whip the whip 'til it’s blue-black
And everybody's asking “Where the roof at?”
They wanna know how I do that, oh

[Chorus]
Just drop the top, hot box the block
Gon’ have the time of your life
Just ride with me, we gon’ hit the streets
Take you on the ride of your life
I’ll take you on the ride of your life
Need you here, on the passenger side
Baby we could slide, have the ride of your life
You're on the ride of your life

[Verse 2]
Might change your life
Still doing that shit that might change your life
Oh, yeah, no gas, no hype
I been doing shit these hoes don't like
Come through and we doing damage
My name on your bitch, yeah, she tatted
Bitches got that, we been had it
Know they gon’ hate, they can’t stand it
I wonder why they all on me
LeBron could never ball on me
And I could get the money like, four ways
Back seat, we can start at the foreplay

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, and I whip the whip 'til it’s blue-black
And everybody's asking “Where the roof at?”
They wanna know how I do that, oh

[Chorus]
Just drop the top, hot box the block
Gon’ have the time of your life
Just ride with me, we gon’ hit the streets
Take you on the ride of your life
I’ll take you on the ride of your life
Need you here, on the passenger side
Baby we could slide, have the ride of your life
We’re on the ride of your life

[Bridge]
Whip it, gas it, clutch it, park it
Grab it, steer it, donuts, oh
Love it how I do it, don’t ya?
Everybody wanna roll
Ain’t no stopping on the highway
Ask me where I’m going I say, "my way"
They ain’t on my level, watch me swerve though
Hit that lane with the turbo

[Chorus]
Just drop the top, hot box the block
Gon’ have the time of your life
Just ride with me, we gon’ hit the streets
Take you on the ride of your life
I’ll take you on the ride of your life
Need you here, on the passenger side
Baby we could slide, have the ride of your life
We’re on the ride of your life

[Outro]
Might change your life
Might change your life, yeah
Might change your life
Might change your life
