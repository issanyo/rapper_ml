[Intro: Zendaya]
I wanna try something, all night
I wanna try something, all night

[Chorus: Zendaya & Chris Brown]
Don't know your name, but I guess I really don't care
I probably should wait, but I wanna let you go there
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something

[Verse 1: Zendaya]
By the way you looking tonight
Only one thing comes to my mind
When the lights come on at 2
I'll still be moving with you
Boy, you're looking at nobody
Just my body

[Chorus: Zendaya & Chris Brown]
Don't know your name, but I guess I really don't care
I probably should wait, but I wanna let you go there
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something

[Post-Chorus: Zendaya]
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, wanna try, babe
Ah-ah-ah, all night
Ah-ah-ah, all night babe

[Refrain: Chris Brown]
Oh I, oh I, oh I
Baby, oh I, oh I, oh I
Oh I, oh I, oh I
Baby, oh I, oh I, oh I, baby

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Hey what you doing tonight?
I see that look in your eyes
I feel the same, yeah, yeah
Miss your lips, girl, when we kiss (we kiss)
Why don't we handle this? (oh, oh, oh)
Girl, you know I need some affection (yeah, girl)

[Chorus: Zendaya & Chris Brown]
Don't know your name, but I guess I really don't care
I probably should wait, but I wanna let you go there
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something

[Post-Chorus: Zendaya]
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, I wanna try, babe
Ah-ah-ah, all night
Ah-ah-ah, all night, babe

[Verse 3: Zendaya]
This ain't forever, baby, just tonight
Just sit back and take my direction now

[Chorus: Zendaya & Chris Brown]
Don't know your name, but I guess I really don't care
I probably should wait, but I wanna let you go there
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something new, all night, oh (I wanna try something new new)

[Post-Chorus: Zendaya & Chris Brown]
Ah-ah-ah, hey, I wanna try, baby
Ah-ah-ah, I wanna try, baby
Ah-ah-ah, ooh, babe
Ah-ah-ah, girl, if you let me
Ah-ah-ah, I wanna try, baby
Ah-ah-ah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah-ah-ah, ooh, babe

[Outro: Zendaya]
I like that new-new, boy, I like that new
Wanna try
Give me that new-new, boy, give me that new
Wanna try
I like that new-new, boy, I like that new
Wanna try
Give me that new-new, boy, give me that new
All night
