[Intro: Marc E. Bassy]
I said I need it all for free
My love, my love, my love

[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
Hey, me and my brothers made it to the top
From the Bay, now we pullin' up on a yacht
Everything I sing about is joy
And I be climbing like the real Mccoy

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
My love, my love, my love
Never trick my love, yeah (oh yeah)
My love, my love, my love
Never trick my love, oh yeah
Isn't it lovely?
Isn't it wonderful?
Yeah my love, my love
Never trick my love, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Bobby Brackins]
Oh yeah, with my brothers, fuck my enemies
Still gettin' blunted out these double trees
If you's a motherfucker friend of me
Then your enemies gonna be my enemies
Oh yeah, plenty weed and some Hennessy
We on your girlfriends, nigga 'til infinity
Oh yeah, old milk she gon' spoil on me
The loyalty gonna be my royalty

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
My love, my love, my love
Never trick my love, yeah
My love, my love, my love
Never trick my love, oh yeah
Isn't it lovely?
Isn't it wonderful?
Yeah my love, never trick my love
Never trick my love, oh yeah

[Verse 3: Bobby Brackins]
Oh yeah, first one to teach you how to hold a Glock
Got the YSL black leather or the crocodile
Faded on any occasions, like to smoke a lot
We can go sail in lilttle yachty, we could boat a lot
Hold the Glock, be my ride or die, Nina
To my ex girl, you can't ask me if I seen her
No, 'cause she ain't around
My shit goin' up and their shit goin' down
You know I'm fuckin' with-

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
My love, my love, my love
Never trick my love, yeah
My love, my love, my love
Never trick my love, oh yeah
Isn't it lovely?
Isn't it wonderful?
Yeah my love, never trick my love
Never trick my love, oh yeah, oh yeah
