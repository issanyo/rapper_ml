[Verse 1: Bobby Brackins]
Tell the drummers keep drumming
Ba-rum-pa-tum-tum, pretty baby I’m coming
For every fuck boy that think they have something on me
They ain’t got nothing on me
This life wisdom free
‘Bout to start a riot
Baby I’m just [?]
Been that nigga taking off like a pilot
I eat that thing on a real nigga diet
Won’t tell the homies, lover we can stay private
Some freaky things baby, let’s try it
If your love had a price, pretty baby I’d buy it
Pretty baby I’d buy it

[Chorus: Bobby Brackins]
I saw you out with a fuck boy
And he safe, he safe
But you should take a risk on me
I saw you out with a fuck boy
I don’t play no games
But you should back that thing on me
Leave the fuck boy at the house
Come over ‘round two
Leave the fuck boy at the house
I’ma show you how I do
Leave the fuck boy at the house
Come over ‘round two
Leave the fuck boy at the house
I’ma show you how I do

[Verse 2: Marc E. Bassy]
Don’t let me catch you out there with that man again
I would’ve fought for you girl with my two hands
And I would kiss you everywhere, you’ll feel no pain
Yeah them fuck boys on the left ain’t about romance
I seen that boy type, and he’s so tight
And he ain’t real, he a liar
Come home every night ‘cause that pussy is fire
Yeah that pussy is fire

[Chorus: Bobby Brackins]
I saw you out with a fuck boy
And he safe, he safe
But you should take a risk on me
I saw you out with a fuck boy
I don’t play no games
But you should back that thing on me

[Bridge: Marc E. Bassy]
Leave him alone
You might go to his house baby
But with me you’re right at home
Leave him alone
I was right there every single time
That motherfucker did you wrong
I ain’t never been hugged [?], I ain’t [?]
That one ain’t the one
You girls don’t understand, how could you trust them?
That one ain’t the one

[Chorus: Bobby Brackins]
I saw you out with a fuck boy
And he safe, he safe
But you should take a risk on me
I saw you out with a fuck boy
I don’t play no games
But you should back that thing on me
