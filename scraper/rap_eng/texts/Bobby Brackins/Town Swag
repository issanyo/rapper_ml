They ain't swag swag swaggin like we nigga
Town swag swaggin like we nigga
They ain't swag swag swaggin like we nigga
Town swag swaggin like we nigga

[Verse 1]
I got chips like I push mad bricks
Parked it and established
Lifestyle so lavish
I'm on with a bad bitch
I'm livin out my dream
I'm swaggin and buy things
Like mini size visine
Catchin the red eye
I'm feelin the head high
No stoppin at red lights
Mobbin the s5 (ooh)
We mobbin the s5
Show bitch young fly flashy
Yo bitch look like cassius
Sassy and nasty classy and nasty
I don't give a fuck as long as your bitch nasty

[Hook]
They ain't swag swag swaggin like we nigga
Town swag swaggin like we nigga
They ain't swag swag swaggin like we nigga
Town swag swaggin like we nigga
