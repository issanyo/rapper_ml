[Intro: August Grant & Bobby Brackins]
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Oh, na, na, yeah
Oh, oh
Same situations in even the most peaceful person's life
May provoke the most gentle being to kill
Those situations aren't looked forward to
But if you love something that much
Might have to rethink your entire mentality


[Chorus: August Grant]
If you got something to kill for
You probably got something to live for
You might just have something to die for
If you got something to kill for
To kill for
If you got something to kill for
If you got something to
If you got something to
If you got something to kill for
To kill for
