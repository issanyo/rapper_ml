[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
I've been drinkin' on champagne, shit go to my head
I can't forget your name, (oh wait) how could I forget?
You say you got a man, I'll make him a regret
It's loud as fuck in this basement, she ask me what I said

[Pre-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
And you drunk and I'm drunk, that's what this coming to
And I don't got time right now, girl you know I wanted to
I would ask you a thousand things - where you coming from?
I know you got stories babe-

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
Save that shit for tomorrow girl
I'ma ask you tomorrow, babe
Tonight just forget 'bout it all, tomorrow I'll be there when you call
(So you can) Save that shit for tomorrow girl
I'll ask you tomorrow, baby
Yeah this time we don't get back, and I think we both know that
(I think we both know that)

[Verse 2: Marc E. Bassy]
You've been cheffin' up gourmet, make sure that I stay
I took that shit for granted, this time I swear I won't play
I know there's so much history we need to retrace
But right now we a mystery and I'm right up in your space

[Pre-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
You drunk and I'm drunk, that is what this coming to
I don't got time right now, trust me girl I wanted to
Ask you a thousand things, where you're coming from?
I know you got stories babe -

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
Save that shit for tomorrow girl
I'ma ask you tomorrow, babe
Tonight just forget 'bout it all
Tomorrow I'll be there when you call
(So you can)
Save that shit for tomorrow girl
I'll ask you tomorrow, baby
Yeah this time we don't get back, and I think we both know that
(Shalalala)

[Verse 3: Bobby Brackins]
You can testify, vent to me, baby what's on your mind?
Tell me tomorrow girl, tonight enjoy this wine
Tonight enjoy my time, aye baby I'm so into you
I eat the world, like dinner food-  I mention you in interviews
Oh bay-bee-ey-ey, you got me hooked
My sex will leave you shook
You should never judge a book by its cover
She always stoked I grew up 'round some G's
But tomorrow I will listen to your needs

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
Save that shit for tomorrow girl
I'ma ask you tomorrow, babe
Tonight just forget 'bout it all
Tomorrow I'll be there when you call
(So you can)
Save that shit for tomorrow girl
I'll ask you tomorrow, baby
Yeah this time we don't get back, and I think we both know that
(I think we both know that)

[Outro: Marc E. Bassy]
Ohhh ohh oh
Yes we could (save it)
Save it for tomorrow
All your problems, all your drama
Save it for tomorrow (save it)
