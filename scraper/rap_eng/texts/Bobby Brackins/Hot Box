Then we chillin on the west where Oakland at!?
Young niggas be wildin', and we smokin' that
Anywhere that we feel bro we holdin' that
Can't sit still bruh, yeah we rollin' that
Ooh wee, burn it on down for real
Poppin from the window to the wall to the ceiling
No homicides but I'm about to make a killing

Your girlfriend wanna visit

Roll up with the windows up

She down for whatever cause she know what's up
I'm like, "Roll another one", she said "Oh yeah, yup"
Yeah, lookin' out for the rollers
Pass it to the left, I'm looking over my shoulders
Always had a chip, guess it's more so a boulder
I'm always 2 on, you don't never see me sober
Yeah, from the bay to the universe
