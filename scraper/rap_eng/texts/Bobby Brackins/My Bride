[Verse 1]
Call my moms up, where the rings at?
Where the valuable rings at?
Best keep a lady
Hope she says yes when I ask
I’ll trade it all for my best man on call
You sexy, it’s too raw
My side bitch long gone
My sexy baby
I know I’m crazy
Been thinking lately
That you’re the lady for me

[Chorus]
We might be
Like wanna be my bride?
Wanna be my bride?
Like you wanna be my bride?
Wanna be my bride?
We winnin’ every night
We winnin’ every night
My bride gon’ get it right
My bride gon’ fuck me right

[Verse 2]
I found my bride, girl where your groom at?
The [?] is never where we do that
Good ass [?] where the food at?
I got you open like a new wrap
Lately baby, let me tell you one thing
Please do that something I like
Been looking forward to sex with you girl
Learn to [?] more lights
All I ask girl is give me credit for some of the shit that I do
You fuck with these hoes ‘til I die
I will only love you

[Chorus]
We might be
Like wanna be my bride?
Wanna be my bride?
Like you wanna be my bride?
Wanna be my bride?
We winnin’ every night
We winnin’ every night
My bride gon’ get it right
My bride gon’ fuck me right
