[Verse 1: Bobby Brackins]
All dimes in my celly from Keisha to Kelly
Best time on the belly, go dumb make the telly
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm, I'm ready
All in the fashion, getting lit with Lil Debbie
Alexander McQueen in a bitter machine
If the purchase just like me, then I might just eat it
They say I'm too conceited, I just know that I'm rare
Make the craziest stunts, bitch I go dumb every year
Gold grill, gold jewels, bitch I'm stuntin'
Shine bright in the light [?] dozen
Didn't know me then, then I bet you know me now
All these mother fuckers wanna be my homie now
Drop top whip, copin' new Rollies now
Real true clique and my niggas hold me down
I need five for a show, I need five for a verse
And if she choose up I need five out her purse
Real things!

Hook:
Too rare  don't talk to me!
Too rare, bring guap to me!
Too rare  don't talk to me!
Too rare, bring guap to me!

[Verse 2: Lil Debbie]
All main, all black
I seen you at the mall at the half off rack
Blunt full of OG and a cup full of yak
Don't need a house for less than a stack! (bitch)
Gold teeth, gold hair
You ain't from the town then don't go there
Basic ass bitches y'all going nowhere
Shining on you haters, with game so rare!
40 in my hand, pass the homie the bottle
Do my own thing, so I bet your ho follow
Mobbin' in the whip and we goin' full throttle
Lean in my cup, looking like I hit the lotto!
They call me Debbie, ho! Lil Debbie, ho!
If you a hatin' ass bitch, you a petty ho!
Hot boxin' choppas with my bruh Kool John
Fur coat with long nails that glue on!

Hook:
Too rare don't talk to me!
Too rare, bring guap to me!
Too rare don't talk to me!
Too rare, bring guap to me!

[Outro]
Mobbin' in the whip and we goin' full throttle
Full, full, full, full throttle
All in the fashion, getting lit with Lil Debbie
Debb, Debb, Lil Debbie
Shining on you haters, with game so rare!
Rare, r-r-rare
They say I'm too conceited, I just know that I'm rare
R-r, rare, R-rare
Too rare don't talk to me!
Too rare, bring guap to me!
