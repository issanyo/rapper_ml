[Verse 1]
Yea I'mma do it, I'mma do it for the bay
Banging Dannon All Day and Stay On It Gang
Mobbing up the block where all the G's hang
Hit the deep east just to pick up some dank
I met a bad bitch that was settled in the 'Rich
Mom went to Skyline friends went to O High
Hopped online and boothang researched me
Function in Berkeley, boothang was earthy
The most is what I'm doing
Everybody waiting on the Go Dav reunion
707, 925, 415, 650, 510 and 408 be pimpin'
Boppas be flippin' when we wood grain grippin'
Pimp hand strong we ain't never been trippin'
Reppin' the Golden State on the Golden Gate whippin'

[Hook]
Earthquake make that ass shake girl
Earthquake make that ass shake girl
Earthquake make that ass shake girl
Go hard like you reppin' the Golden State girl
Earthquake make that ass shake girl
Earthquake make that ass shake girl
Earthquake make that ass shake girl
Go hard like you reppin' the Golden State girl

[Verse 2]
Been getting dumb cake since I moved to LA
Feelin' like the Money Team shout out to Ray J
Just smashed an on girl but I forgot where she stays
I think I dropped that bop off in Marina Del Ray
Knock a new thang at LAX
Hollywood poppin' girls sell they sex
Yeah this the Golden State got a hipster girl in Silver Lake
In Compton like YG with shorty from the I.E
I got a runner with nothing on but her airmax
Goes to Santa Monica City but she graduated Fairfax
LA face with an Oakland young booty
Maui, wowi, met her in the valley
Stay on it the whole crew hot
California love man R.I.P. 2Pac
It's LA hoe, where the stars live
A lot of hot bitches and hella artists

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Lay low then make dough
Get pesos out in San Diego
Let's go with two girls make them lesbo
559 mackin', mobbin' out to Fresno
Pimp hand strong, never weak hoe
Partying with sororities in Chico
SB in IV
Go hard yeah partying on DP
West Coast Cali is the west coast
Got work in Sacramento and Modesto
Nor Cal to So Cal what is it
It's me in that Raiders shit with bitches when I visit
They better bang this in every city
I travel with a pen just to sign your girls titties
And everybody comes to tour California
Yeah I'm in the building chillin' with the owner

[Hook]
