[Intro]
From a solo cup
I'm still sippin' whiskey from a solo cup
From a solo cup
I'm still sippin' whiskey from a solo cup

[Verse 1: Chandler Rachelle]
Mmm, good thing we can talk it up
Handcuff, baby, we can lock it up
We should lock it up
Then throw away the key like an officer
Mmm, I wanna do our body talk
Wanna get turnt up, make your body erupt
Make your body erupt
We can get turnt up, with the party spot

[Pre-Hook: Chandler Rachelle]
But when you gonna tell me that it's all mine?
Oh, I got a pocket full of sunshine
For one time, you wanna call the one time
'Cause I'm moderate, ooh

[Hook: Chandler Rachelle]
From a solo cup
I'm still sippin' whiskey from a solo cup
'Cause I'm moderate, ooh
From a solo cup
I'm still sippin' whiskey from a solo cup
'Cause I'm moderate, ooh
From a solo cup
I'm still sippin' whiskey from a solo cup
I love it, ooh
From a solo cup
I'm still sippin' whiskey from a solo cup
'Cause I'm moderate, ooh

[Verse 2: Chandler Rachelle]
Put in overtime
Know how to get it crackin' like a coconut
Sippin' on that solo cup
Still pourin' up in that solo cup
Rock the boat back and forth
Put it on ice, no Jack and coke
No chaperone
Sippin' on that, no chaperone

[Pre-Hook: Chandler Rachelle]
But when you gonna tell me that it's all mine?
Oh, I got a pocket full of sunshine
For one time, you wanna call the one time
'Cause I'm moderate, ooh

[Hook: Chandler Rachelle]
From a solo cup
I'm still sippin' whiskey from a solo cup
'Cause I'm moderate, ooh
From a solo cup
I'm still sippin' whiskey from a solo cup
'Cause I'm moderate, ooh
From a solo cup
I'm still sippin' whiskey from a solo cup
I love it, ooh
From a solo cup
I'm still sippin' whiskey from a solo cup
'Cause I'm moderate, ooh

[Verse 3: Bobby Brackins]
In a fast car like a rider
Stayin' in Oakland but we party in Vegas
Got solo cups, got enough for the neighbors
Everybody turnt, save the bottle for later
Do you want whiskey or do you want Pinot?
All I do is mob like a young Al Pachino
If you too warm, I'll drink Pelegrino
Your boyfriend nice but I don't think he know
That I murder it
Wherever he from, I never heard of it
Shut the shit up like turbulence
Solo cups smellin' like bourbon shit

[Hook: Chandler Rachelle]
From a solo cup
I'm still sippin' whiskey from a solo cup
'Cause I'm moderate, ooh
From a solo cup
I'm still sippin' whiskey from a solo cup
'Cause I'm moderate, ooh
From a solo cup
I'm still sippin' whiskey from a solo cup
I love it, ooh
From a solo cup
I'm still sippin' whiskey from a solo cup
'Cause I'm moderate, ooh
