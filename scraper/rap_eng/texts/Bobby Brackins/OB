[Verse 1: Bobby Brackins]
Baddest OB's, I'ma need that
One that sips Hen and asks where the tree's at
Talk to your girlfriends, give 'em all feed back
Suckers fall in love, I can stay detached
Baby I'm on, love my last song
Heard you fucked Nic and Marc to that song
I'ma killa, "Hey Ma" Cam'ron
Real nigga, fuck you with my pants on

[Bridge: Bobby Brackins & Marc E. Bassy]
And its a lot of things that we can do
We can mix my buddies and your crew
Mess with your girl on the side
So I can not be surprised

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
When you're a OB
For me and my homies
Some things will never change
You know I can't complain about OB's
Fuck me and my homies
Some things will never change
You'll always be our baby

[Post-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
OB, yeah, just an OB, yeah
You're just an OB, OB, yeah
Yeah, just an OB, OB
You're just an OB
You'll always be our baby

[Verse 2: Bobby Brackins]
I've been thinking about you lately
And thinking about your homegirl lately
And I'm about to pop off no safety
I'm thinking about the dome that you gave me
And I heard its a little birdie around town
So I'll take you home, get the dome, you go down
You like us, I know now
Make us bust like 4 pound

[Bridge: Bobby Brackins & Marc E. Bassy]
And its a lot of things that we can do
We can mix my buddies and your crew
Mess with your girl on the side
So I can not be surprised

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
When you're a OB
For me and my homies
Some things will never change
You know I can't complain about OB's
Fuck me and my homies
Some things will never change
You'll always be our baby

[Post-Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
OB, yeah, just an OB, yeah
You're just an OB, OB, yeah
Yeah, just an OB, OB
You're just an OB
You'll always be our baby
