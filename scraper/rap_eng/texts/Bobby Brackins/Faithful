[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
She don’t want commitment
She up in the club
She just want a baller
To show her some love
She got you at home
Tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
Tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
Tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
And you’re tryna be faithful

[Verse 1: Bobby Brackins]
You ain’t got it like me, what you talking ‘bout
Coming home with me is what she’s talking ‘bout
Hella drank but the tree gave us cottonmouth
She gon’ walk kinda funny when she leave my house

[Bridge: Bobby Brackins]
Big ballin’, big big ballin’
Got your main chick calling
Neck full of diamonds
Probably why she calling, ohh
She the type to fall in love
But I can’t give her all my love
I just want to beat it up
Man it shows or what?

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
She don’t want commitment
She up in the club
She just want a baller
To show her some love
She got you at home
Tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
Tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
Tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
And you’re tryna be faithful

[Verse 2: Bobby Brackins]
She just wanna know what a nigga’s pockets ‘bout
Saw the crib, now she know what the pockets ‘bout
From the town with the crib like a doctor’s house
And I’m flyer than all the helicopter routes

[Bridge: Bobby Brackins]
Big ballin’, big big ballin’
Got your main chick calling
Neck full of diamonds
Probably why she calling, ohh
She the type to fall in love
But I can’t give her all my love
I just want to beat it up
Man it shows, or what?

Tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
Tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
Tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
And you’re tryna be faithful

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Peeled off in the ride
Big budget like a movie
Keep your bitch by your side
‘Cause them hoes be choosey
Show her the time of her life
You should already know it
These girls quick to lie
That’s why you can’t trust these hoes
She told me she want me
And you call her, you’re only
Plus she fucked the homie
And she ride like a pony

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
She don’t want commitment
She up in the club
She just want a baller
To show us some love
She got you at home
Tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
Tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
Tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
And you’re tryna be faithful

[Outro: Bobby Brackins (Ty Dolla $ign)]
(Oh yeah)
She has a good time when she's with me mane (Dolla $ign)
I'ma show her a really good time
I'ma show her things she never seen, do things she never done
Made another hit for the radio station
