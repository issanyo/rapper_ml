[faint sample]

[Verse 1]
Girl I feel like (?) on my gold flex
Cause I know that Imma go next
Time sweeping on my Rolex
And I think it's time to find a new x

And we don't get along but it's good sex
Yea you better hit me back, saw the read text
Go and bounce that ass like a bad chick
(?) hella cash

[Chorus]
I don't want to be reckless
But I'm tryna find my next x, yeah
Living in the land of excess
Yea I'm tryna to find my next x, yeah
Wanna wake up for breakfast
Make love to my next x, yeah
When it's done keep the necklace
You can give it to your next x, yeah

[Verse 2]
Tell my label better (?) these day
Let me drop a couple things for the street's sake
Yeah, I'm tryna start a heat wave
Don't even trip girl
I'm always 'bout to be late

But you know I got plans for you
Rooftop reservations
Got plans for two

But for now you're my baby
Soon enough you'll know that I'm crazy
When you figure out that I'm crazy
I still get you wetter than the Navy

Don't let the fuck shit phase me
She don't call me by my real name
She call me Bassy

And I like it like that
The real me
Too deep
I be hiding 'em back
Loose leaf
Lose sleep
I be writing like that
Chopping line after line
I be lying like that

[Chorus]
I don't want to be reckless
But I'm tryna find my next x, yeah
Living in the land of excess
Yea I'm tryna to find my next x, yeah
Wanna wake up for breakfast
Make love to my next x, yeah
When it's done keep the necklace
You can give it to your next x, yeah

I don't want to be reckless
But I'm tryna find my next x, yeah
Living in the land of excess
Yea I'm tryna to find my next x, yeah
Wanna wake up for breakfast
Make love to my next x, yeah
When it's done keep the necklace
You can give it to your next x, yeah
