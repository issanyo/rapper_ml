[Verse 1: YMTK]
Green world, my dream world
Volcano mountains with blueberry fountains
I float millions and millions of miles away
I feel closer to home here
Its only a matter of months before I come back down
And the fun taps out
I’m young and I’m high and I don’t want to come back
I left the calendar, compass, and map
You can leave a message right after the breeze
As I inhale april leaves

(Hook)
Every body wants some time in a January Dream
February all I know
Marching through life will not be easy
You leave me no choice but to roll up
I am the wind the wind is me
Blowing through April trees

Roll Weed Up
Roll Weed

[Verse 2: Bobby Brackins]
Stay on it gang I can’t stress it enough
Catch me in traffic I’m rolling it up
Take a nice break then I go right back to you
Since the seventh grade I’ve been going back to you
I remember Macking at the school dance
Been there you’ve always been a cool friend
Didn’t care about the money
You was there when i didn’t have the money
Purple Trees Purple Leaves Purple C’s Purple B’s Is what I’m seeing now
Stay on it gang thats what Im screaming out

Feeling like the greatest
Feeling like we made it
We headed to the top and Im feeling like they hate us
So lost in the day I don’t know what today is
It’s January Dreams rollin up with a Bay bitch
(Hook)
