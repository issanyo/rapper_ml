[Intro]

[Verse 1]

Dutch

Why even ask where the offer is going
K.O. like [?]
Niggas feel the heat like the gas when I blow it
Up shit creek but the pattern is so sick
It was never fat when I flow
Now I'm on the path of an animal
Sit on up the grass get passive as row
Nigga gotta slow the fuck down

Five days, I been up now
K.O. yo, what's up now?
Ask every hater, what's up now?
Nah, nigga, this ain't luck, nigga
Only way to go is up now
Window seat so I look down
LaunchKontrol takin' us up now
My hands up, don't shoot! [Gun shot}

[Verse 2]

We exterminate, with no voice
So no talking, killa's choice
You stay back, [?]
Tellin' them that they best work
You know what'll make shit worse?
Don't tell 'em we was here first
Don't tell 'em they was always gifted
Live 'em like they was always first

Don't let 'em do more than spit a verse
Don't let 'em do more than activism
They just let it swing fast with 'em
You ain't comin' class, boy, yo ass suspended
A bunch of motherless math mathematics
They the type to take a box and badge it
We the type to serve racks to fashion
Soon as we know we grow past it

[Hook]

Back like the plague
I have to say
I don't like to see my dogs kill
Like some strays
I don't like to see 'em in a pound
Like some strays
I gotta tweet a new pound key
Every day

[Verse 3]

So fuck a blue light
But nobody found it in they brains
How can you expect respect
When they doin' drive-bys on the rival gang
Why motherfuckas wanna start yo pace
Why people tell me that I gotta stay
I think I might need some LaunchKontrol
Fuck it Ima have to try this pace

Take us up!
