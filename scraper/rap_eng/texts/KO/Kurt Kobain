Well like it should, and well
He got locked in cold storage and well..
Well that ain't good
He start, thinking about memories
Seen ball up his fist and bang on the pipe
All the evil things I've done
Tear me apart, swallow me alive
I only hurt somebody well, when they deserve it, and I
I only hurt somebody well, when I get nervous

Only know one dance daddy
I charleston on your skull, and these
These streets is filled with matadors who done tamed the bull
Forgot about heaven homey
Because it's clear we heading southbound
If I find out where you live

Take my shotgun down to the river

There's just things I can't forget

Swear to God Tommy and I know you don't want me
I ain't gonna play by the rules

There's wolves in the woods
(?)And a garden, it's filled with fools(?)
I got a good deal worked out downtown
They sell me lies cheaper than truths
If you ever wanna come down and meet my connect
I'll be happy to introduce
And you swore that that, swore that that
You didn't have no gun
But you lied Kurt, ya your like Kurt
And you hurt everyone
And you swore that that, swore that that
You didn't have no gun
But you lied Kurt, ya your like Kurt
And you hurt everyone
