[Post-Chorus]
Time in a, in a, in a bottle
Time in a, in a, in a bottle
Time in a, in a, in a bottle

[Intro]
If I could save time in a bottle
The first thing that I'd like to do
Is to save every day 'til eternity passes away
Just to spend them with you

[Verse 1]
If I could make days last forever
If words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then
Again, I would spend them with you

[Chorus]
But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do, once you find them, hey-ee-yay
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I wanna go through time with, hey-ee-yay

[Post-Chorus]
Time in a, in a, in a bottle
Time in a, in a, in a bottle
Time in a, in a, in a bottle

[Verse 2]
If I had a box just for wishes
And dreams that had never come true
The box would be empty, except for the memory of how
They were answered by you

[Chorus]
But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do, once you find them, hey-ee-yay
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I wanna go through time with, hey-ee-yay

[Drop]
(Now) (Ooh)
I wanna go through time with, I wanna go through time
I wanna go through time with, I wanna go through time

[Bridge]
I wanna go through time with

[Drop]
(Now) (Ooh)
I wanna go through time with, I wanna go through time
I wanna go through time with, I wanna go through time

[Outro]
I wanna go through time with, I wanna go through time
I wanna go through time with
