I know it's been a while
But I'm right here
On my own two feet
As far as I can take
As the train goes passing by
Coming closer every time
I saw, as far as I can see
It’s raining and I wasn’t playing inside
Cast shadow can't be at the night
I'm leaving all my problems at the door
I haven't felt this way before
I'm coming home, home, home
I'm coming home
I know it's been a while
Since I've seen your face
But you're calling me
Calling out my name
As the trains come passing by
Now I know it's almost time
Oh I, I can finally be
It’s raining and I wasn’t playing inside
Cast shadow can't be at the night
I'm leaving all my problems at the door
I haven't felt this way before
I'm coming home, home, home
I'm coming home
But I'm coming home
