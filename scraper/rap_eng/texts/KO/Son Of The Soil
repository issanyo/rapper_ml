[Hook: K.O.]
Ng'sacel' uk'buza, cel' uk'buza
Umutu ofana nami Umcingezela kanjani
Ng'sacel' uk'buza, cel' uk'buza
Umutu ofana nami Umcingezela kanjani
Son of the soil, son of the soil
Uthi uvala la, uvle le
Vale le, vule la
Ubani umakoya, ubani umakoya
Umutu ofana nami Umcingezela kanjani

[Verse 1: K.O]
Inja ye stayela, ikleva engazibeki phansi
Rocking my own shit
Skhanda Republic is African renaissance
African renaissance
La kunenyuku lakhona lesgebengu is binne kant
Nna nka se e hemisi, angeke ngiyiphe ne chance
We need a melanin dough stain
Just for the ambiance
Skhanda God, I been the kid with the juice
Inja yakhona I been the kid with the sauce
I've been making a living
By keepin' in true in each and every hit I record
The flow is outta here, the flow is outta here
Just call me Houdini the god
I know that you saw all that shit from the gate
By the way that I been ripping these bars
H.N letter I to the C
Yeah that's what you call a head nigga in charge
Ntwana just give me a call
I'mma just ? with y'all
Thina sa thatha machance
Sathatha mamilllions
We were risking it all
I know I'm a sinner for sure
But I'm swaggalicious
On my way to a prayer meeting in Christian Dior, authi yam
Getting all that boy is pretty raw authi yam
USkhanda God yi authi yam
Mara fede ngisazophusha
Azok'tshela marhumusha, I don't just do it
I need a cheque signed
You better come correct ntwana
Nje ngetekki elishaya nge swish
'Cause I need to join the Black Billionaires Club
That new BBC boy
That's Black Economic Excellence
That new BEE boy
The son of the soil
I'm out here tryna secure, the bag
Intwana enomoya, number k'dala ngiyirhola
Fana no boy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Youngsta CPT]
I'm the black panther, forever Wakanda
The coloured chihuahua, I'm repping iKappa
I'm far from the regular Western Cape impotence
Since you're the treasurer, open the register on
Yassis I'm a hoodlum, laat my broek hang
Give you goosebumps
Six milli ways to die broer
How do y'all choose a good one
Disciplined lyricist, keep that unlimited
I can't be visited, lost in the wilderness
Stupid remedial, Y-Gen ?
Come from the dirt with the rawest material
Head in the millie meal killing the cereal
TV is wack, I'm curving the aerial
Fliping the channel, your show just got canceled
The Arabian gangsta, my car is a camel like skrr
Propvol in a old bakkie
Ninety nine problems, no money
Backstage i was so Gummy
Watching Yizo Yizo and Soul Buddiez
Simunye Groove, yeah the old One
For the Cape Malays and the Khoisan
I send you back where you came from
With a toy gun I'm the soil son
