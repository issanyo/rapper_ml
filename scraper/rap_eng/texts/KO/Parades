[Hook:K.O.]

I be feeling like every other day is my day
Keep that shit up on a hundred you got something to say
You know that evil come and go, you can’t do nothing but pray
With all my niggas on the go, We walk around like Parades
So what you say (Aye!)
You getting money?
You pushing cars?
You spending hundreds?
Oh, you a star?
So why you running from who you are?
So why you running?

[Verse: DAEtrius]

KO Mustang, riding thru Atlanta but we talking Biscayne
Only 300 on me, still chiefing with my Gang
Treat these hoes like I’m Shaq all I do is duck thangs
Keep it low-key, all these tings call me Zane
Fuck fame, I been plotting on the axis longer than a fucking crane
On my John Wayne, Kill them with the flows, Steph Curry range
Dior denim, with the giela', I’m Insane
Lose them with the sauce, but I bless em with the pain..
None of this shit on me make me made
These niggas all lame,diggin on each other like they tay
Take these shots in my J’s, catch me with the 3 and my shot Parkay
Days with my brother, Cold in the summer
Long enough to realize a young nigga a number
You know its tough in the gutter, riding on simpson tryna fit you with the glover,its room in the uppers
Life like rayford, tryna get to the Claude banks
Concentrate peace to Anne Frank…..

[Hook:K.O.]

I be feeling like every other day is my day
Keep that shit up on a hundred you got something to say
You know that evil come and go, you can’t do nothing but pray
With all my niggas on the go, We walk around like Parades
So what you say (Aye!)
You getting money?
You pushing cars?
You spending hundreds?
Oh, you a star?
So why you running from who you are?
So why you running?

[Verse 2: DAEtrius]

Puerto Rican body on her, met her in the barrio
Think her name Rosario? shoutout to Niqo!
I’m downstairs but I plan to leave the lobby yo
A turning point, like I’m Mario
Exchange fucks then Im Adios
Quick but its timeless, she yellow like jaundice
Imma let you love me for a second, you should vine this
Maneuver like a hymen cause i don't like to be idle,nigga i ain't simon
Says this is perfect timing on my priming
To be frank live fast die young shout out to lymon
We breaking bad, you better call saul, moving like the mafia these niggas tryna break my balls, Pause!
Im Yassin to the mainstream, you Justin Bieb to the money team
I part rivers in these Hudson jeans, I build bridges on my Dr.King
I want a dynasty on A&E, Ain't nobody A as me
Still fuck with Ebro, yup! I did this shit for Pete
I got something to say, feeling like I’m 3
Stacks, all my cards stacked nigga play with me

[Hook:K.O.]

I be feeling like every other day is my day
Keep that shit up on a hundred you got something to say
You know that evil come and go, you can’t do nothing but pray
With all my niggas on the go, We walk around like Parades
So what you say (Aye!)
You getting money?
You pushing cars?
You spending hundreds?
Oh, you a star?
So why you running from who you are?
So why you running?

[Rob Markman:]

"There is a stereotype that down in the south they don't care about lyrics but I came up on Brad Jordan."

[2Chainz:]

"For Real!"

[Lil Wayne:]
It's just that in the south, our reality is different
