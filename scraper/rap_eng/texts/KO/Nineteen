Yo this my life and I'm living it, Yo this work I be giving it
This life diminishin', My mindset is envisioning
The ball in my hand best believe I'mma pivot it
518 stand up, yo my team finna get the chip
Knock em out with the fist of a punchline
It's lunch time
We having emcees signed and unsigned
I shed light on these dudes, give em that sunshine
Life is a struggle no doubt but yo sometimes....

I see my dreams come true, life getting easier
Cuz after hardship comes ease, it hits like meteors
But it's a cycle, so here comes the media
Back at it again, deceiving ya, misleading ya
And it don't stop there, encyclopedias
Be written by Europeans selective amnesia
You want the truth, gotta understand the game son
It ain't a good thing that hip hop met the fame son
It was a revolution, the roots in which it came
Was pointing out injustice had to go like Kurt Cobain
Had to stop the flame, take the seed outta the grain
But the spirit still here, and we always remain
We back at it, I'm ill at it like Illmatic
19 in the game, man I rap so savage
Uh one time for Sooriya for Damascus
Two for those that spoke up now in caskets
Three for whole wide world the whole atlas
Four for the dudes on that survival tactics
We back man, this my lyrical practice
The Nubian dynasty, gon wash y'all like baptists
