[Hook: Sniper]
I'm alone in the dark writing my last letter
I'm alone in the dark writing my last letter
High as a muthafucka now I feel better
High as a muthafucka now I feel better

[Verse 1: Sniper]
Hey it's subliminal
Lyrical killer I'm Senekal
Out of my mind it's sort of bitch is a criminal
I'm so better thinking my private
I murder rappers like addictions to survive in the ghetto
Emergence from the catago my mind in the zone
Quick descriptions carry weight like they invading stones
Intoxicated by the music beat it's getting me high
Spittin' words like interventions as I'm closing my eyes
Nowadays rappers fake they ain't making no sense
Sniper Lenno throwing up the definition of sick
With no surprise no deny the kid is playing with fire
Picks emotion with these haters they be living a lie
Acknowledge when you see me they calling me the truth
Imprisoned to the booth so I spit it for the youth
A rebel without a cause I'll die for the glory
Harrow clinic images will tell the whole story

[Hook: Sniper]
I'm alone in the dark writing my last letter
I'm alone in the dark writing my last letter
High as a muthafucka now I feel better
High as a muthafucka now I feel better
Slanging to me nigga you ain't no enemy
Murder these rappers is what the beast that he telling me
I'm alone contemplating writing my last letter
A pen and a pad makes me feel better

[Verse 2: Rapper K]
I sit at home meditating to session my situation
One deep concentrating in total isolation
Thinking of my enemies my heart starts racing
Easily penetrating through all the hate and I'm facing
I wrote a long letter to myself and proceeded
To tear it up because I was too afraid to read it
My appetite calling my name, I gotta feed it
I'm giving myself therapy no counseling needed
I'm bout to go insane with blood walling in my vanes
Head pounding from a twenty ton migraine
People beating on my room door try'na check on me
Sinister recurring nightmares resurrected on me
What do you do when the world try'na test ya
When ya fulfill or when ya crack under the pressure
I don't even know who I am memory fails me
Maybe you can open my last letter and tell me

[Hook: Sniper]
I'm alone in the dark writing my last letter
I'm alone in the dark writing my last letter
High as a muthafucka now I feel better
High as a muthafucka now I feel better
Slanging to me nigga you ain't no enemy
Murder these rappers is what the beast that he telling me
I'm alone contemplating writing my last letter
A pen and a pad makes me feel better

[Verse 3: K.O.]
I'm alone in the dark writing my last letter
Cause the life that I lead I feel like getting no better
Try'na maintain and toughen out the weather
I'm good and holding back tears scared of no man
But it's hard that I feel so I'm screaming for help
But it's like my yell fall on deaf ears
This is happiness I'm chasing but if I catch it
Can I stand tall and face it, used to feel yearn
So I can't take it alone in the dark
Listening to my heart, my brain has a shorty
It keeps telling me nigga go straight for they heart
And murder these rappers they just fish in the sea
You the great white shark, so I turn the bottle up to drown that kayotic thoughts
Cause he ripping me apart
I'm struggling to maintain but he driving me insane
Leave me alone get the fuck outta my brain!

[Hook: Sniper]

[Verse 4: K-Rino]
Ha ha!
I was laying on my palled, drinking mount of a jalice
Forming a strategy a premeditated malice
Contemplating the worst and fighting with two decisions
Imprisoned by three de-hologram visions
My tongue be blow torch in em and flaming them brauns
I respond by spinning off nine demean spuns
I de-failure in faith to your knee cosmetic trims
Amputate your legs and chop off your prosthetic limbs
I'm a killer without a mask but I ain't on a TV
Look directly in that camera cause I wanted em to see me
I was uh, hold up, I just need a moment
Cause I just saw the bodies of my next ten opponents
Doctors wanna copy me and snatch talent out of me
The surgical procedure was not before properly
I'm obviously not normal half crazy I gotta be
World on my shoulders I got a planet on top of me
