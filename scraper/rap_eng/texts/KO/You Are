[intro]
Yeah. This is my dedication to you. I know we don't always live up to what we supposed to be as men, so right now this song that I wrote is my way of apologizing for all the wrong that I did. (Let me) tell you who you really are

[Verse 1]
(You Are)
The beginning and the end
My ocean, my cool wind
My rock and my best friend
The release when I ache
The icing and the cake
My mental escape
The reason behind every plan I make
(You Are)
The Earthly aid of man
The first living creature manufactured by the Creator's hand
The divine nature user
The righteous principle infuser
The key to eternal life
The god reproducer
(You Are)
The cypher, the circular
The second self of Allah
The provider, the nurturer
Deep dimensions
Beautiful visual images
My energy
The infinite extension of all lineage
(You Are)
Euphoria to my optics
The object of all topics
The mother of all prophets
The African goddess
Infinite and time-tested
Intuitive and eclectic
Love manifested

[Chorus]
I'm so glad that I have you
You have given me everything
I'm so glad that I have you
You have given me everything

[Verse 2]
(You Are)
The motivation that I need
The wisdom instilled overtime to help man succeed
The strong will, the discipline
The bearer of our pain
The loyal and forgiving
The wearer of our name
(You Are)
The one who rears the child and protects em
With intellect you inject em
You're every color in the spectrum
The Pinnacle
The best of creation, bar none
Brighter than the sun
The well of knowledge I draw from
(You Are)
Life-giving water
The one who managed to make us men in the absence of a father
The one in whom I confide my imperial pride
My perpetual miracle, my spiritual guide
(You Are)
Reprimand when I act up
And when the world tears me down, you build me back up
The feeling I love to catch
Emotionally attached
The wearer of many hats and physically unmatched

[Chorus]
I'm so glad that I have you
You have given me everything
I'm so glad that I have you
You have given me everything

[Verse 3]
(You Are)
The counselor, the queen
Everything on Earth and in space
The unfathomable dream
Ignite inner excitement with simple chitchat
Whatever I think she is, she's 20 times greater than that
(You Are)
Serious
It ain't wise to play with you
I picture everyday with you
Peace when I lay with you
Feminine narcotics
Hypnotic and sensuous
A vintage Godly image
Individual stimulus
(You Are)
The true definition of heavenly
Who accepted me in all of my error and infidelity
Strength, determination
Focus and dedication
The porthole to the Past
And the future of civilization
(You Are)
Cerebrally orgasmic
The statuesque Queen covered from head to feet in the magic
The one without whom my existence would be worthless
Like the universe being Earthless
You're my drive and my purpose

[Chorus]
I'm so glad that I have you
You have given me everything
I'm so glad that I have you
You have given me everything

(You Are)
