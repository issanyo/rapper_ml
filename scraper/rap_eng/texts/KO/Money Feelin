[Chorus:Kayko]
Where you from my nigga ? How you came to the top so fast my nigga?
Bring the cheese my nigga! What the fuck you doing in my way my nigga?

Bring the cheese my nigga! We hustle everyday we ain't playin' my nigga!

[Verse 1:Kayko]
Money feelin' sup with leanin' Eden bitches reachin' call it trampoleanin'
Fuck the demons stopping me from reachin' guiness, killed it with my penis
Condoms or not that's my business stop complaining
Fire tracks icy lyrics M.B.A.Y.A ,never stop keep on pushin'
Bitch that's how we play ,started in a ghetto little bitch
No fucking gold on my wrist, buckin' and stackin' your bitch is just dancing
She move like monopoly
Fuck up the snitches and lock up the bitches and lock up the bitches and
Light up my blunt but I ,ain't about that blood but I ride with my blood niggas
Real nigga trill nigga fuck all these fake niggas
Ohh my lord, I know that you knock on my door I just started
Already feel like a veteran , one day ill say that I been the man
Been the man been the man benjamin benjamin benjamin franklin rainin'and rainin'

[Chorus:Kayko]
Where you from my nigga? How you came to the top so fast my nigga ?
Bring the cheese my nigga! What the fuck you doing in my way my nigga?
Where you from my nigga? How you came to the top so fast my nigga ?
Bring the cheese my nigga! We hustle everyday we ain't playin' my nigga!

[Verse 2:DJ Mbaya]

[Verse 3:Kayko]
The world is a mess dollar signs on your mind ,grind hustle until you find
Time , passing by ,why you stay in line make your own design , im rolling up a dime
Light it up it shines fuck that cypher shit that kush is mine
Smell a dollar bill from a mile away ,wake up in the green every single day
Ended with a KO started with a Kay ballin so hard call me D-Wade ,wait

Pen and a sheet to play dawg

[Chorus:Kayko]
Where you from my nigga ? How you came to the top so fast my nigga?
Bring the cheese my nigga! What the fuck you doing in my way my nigga?
Where you from my nigga ? How you came to the top so fast my nigga?
Bring the cheese my nigga! We hustle everyday we ain't playin'my nigga!
