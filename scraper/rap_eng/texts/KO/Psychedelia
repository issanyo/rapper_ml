[Verse 2: KO]
My life, my life my life is like a scene out of a movie
K'hlala kushubil (aii)
Don't make me lose it
Psychedelics thoughts I think my mind is playing tricks on me
Ke hloka thuso tryna solve this mystery
Really ntwana cos recently
24 hours honies the only thing that's on my mind, I seem to be functionin' like a busy bee
Ke bona marago, ke bona marago even in my sleep
I swear the situation is gettin' deep
I'm frequently lookin' for the typa baddie to make a porno flick with me
Hope she's good with the wood iNgani une uMlomo one Mr. Min
Listerine
? when you finished
Mine is a rude boy
Life is too short (Siyenza kakhul)
Sleepin' with the devil
Noma iCondom iKhona, kodwa ingane isanda kushawa nges'kun' boy (Kwenzakalani?)

[Chorus: Yung Swiss]
Hooooo
Psy, Psy
Psychedelia
Psychedelia
Uuhh we are
Uuuhh we are

Psychedelia
Uhhh we are
Uhh we are
