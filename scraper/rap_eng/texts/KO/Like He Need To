[Verse 1]
She pull up and hop out the coupe
She know what to, know what to do
We throwin' the [?], like to choose
I jump in that pussy and shoot
Maintain like a fruit
Sippin' that, slurpin' that soup
All this sauce, better do
All this sauce on you

[Pre-Chorus]
We got the room, X-rated
Between your legs, it's rainin'
Girl, ain't this what you came for?
I do it so good, you want more

[Chorus]
So when I call, she gon' call back
Send a message to my phone, tellin' me she want that
Cause he don't know what to do with it
Baby, you know he don't fuck you like he need to
Like he need to
He don't love you like he need to
Like he need to
He don't fuck you like he need to

[Verse 2]
You call me and I'm on the way
You throw it, I'm runnin' the plate
You roll up, I'm sparkin' the J
We all out this, all out this space
And we can't come come down
Unless we call 911
And when I go downtown
You get so damn loud

[Pre-Chorus]
We got the room, X-rated
Between your legs, it's rainin'
Girl, ain't this what you came for?
I do it so good, you want more

[Chorus]
So when I call, she gon' call back
Send a message to my phone, mean that she want that
Cause he don't know what to do with it
Baby, you know he don't fuck you like he need to
Like he need to
He don't love you like he need to
Like he need to
He don't fuck you like he need to

[Verse 3]
He don't fuck you like he need to
I'mma fuck you like you need to
Anythin' that's see through
I kill the pussy, that's lethal
All this dick, I could feed you
Eat it up, we go for round two
Hit my line and I'mma slide through
Girl, you're blessed without the high shoes, yeah
Girl, why you keep wastin' time?
Yeah, yeah, I know you need peace of mind
I can give you all of that
All this pimpin' got you on your back, damn

[Chorus]
Like he need to
He don't love you like he need to
Like he need to
He don't fuck you like he need to
