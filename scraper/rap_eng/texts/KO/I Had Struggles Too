My life is not perfect im telling you i have struggles to
Just telling you the truth not trying to be a bugga boo
I'm not asking for you sympathy just want you to understand my pain
Give me time to explain its a surprise that I'm still sane
I had struggles too
I had struggles too

[Verse 1]

I was born in 97
I was born to be a legend
I had a purpose on this earth i was a kid that fell from heaven
My mother had birth to me while in a marriage
Its crazy that my step-dad is the one that put me in the baby carriage
From birth that's when my struggle began
My father was a handy man
He did the best he can
But he blew more than a ceiling fan
My father was a drug addict
His brain cells were fried
The lights couldn't have been on in the addict
But he would give his life if he had it
Father was taken to the hospital
Found out he had a stroke
I would have been more sentimental
But we had hardly spoke
He was down in Florida bout four states away
Even if we tried it was hours in the layaway
Didn't want his picture to just fade away
Felt like he said his goodbyes before he passed away

[Verse 2]
My brother was born on the millennium
May be small but his heart was titanium
He loved to play his sports
He could spend his whole day in a gymnasium
His love for the outdoors brought him to his disease
Pulmonary hemosiderosis what does that even mean
One definition is he would never be the same
Should of been me so who do you think i blame
1 in 4 million now ain't that a freaking shame
Im' there for him but we will never understand his pain
Big dreams of becoming a builder
But can never be an outfielder
Not keeping nothing from you
There's no way that i cold filter
When he first got it he was in the second grade
He was in intensive care for about 10 days
Vital scans blood draws x rays and cat scans
Patient number in the hospital was like his wristband
I cried for hours on a 10 day span
When he came home o made him feel like he was the man
Visited everyday to see my little brother
Chords hooked up to help him on his recover
Breathing  so hard i hate that he had to suffer
But he was a soldier there everyday for his comfort

[Voice Mail:Grandpa]
Yeah, Keenan? I was just calling to see how you was doing this is Grand Daddy
I'll talk to you later unless i die...

[Verse 3]
Been a while haven't seen my grandpa in 3 years
Him passing away before i got to see him again was my biggest fear
After the voice-message was one of the last times i talked to him
He asked me in the conversation to come visit him
Never once did he mention to me that he had two heart attacks
Didn't want me to worry he wanted me to stay relaxed
I asked him how he was doing he answered just fine
Unless i die he didn't want me to know it was just a lie
