[Verse 1: K.O.]

I pray five times a day to run and hide from my ways

My past is a blizzard of hard times and mistakes

Pondering in the night tryna recover from heart break

The future seemed so perilous and the present not so great

In sujud I found my soul had a heart conversation

Cupid ain't a God or an angel he's just Satan

Tryna get you chillin' with the sisters and start makin

Problems in your life that lead to serious situations

Some will tell me to shut up, some gon tell me to preach

Love can be real, but sometimes it's a leech

We think we in love but our journey ain't complete

All we are doing now is inflicting self-deceit

I pray to the Lord that I can see straight & clear

Allah make me conscious of my flaws make me fear

Love has become a word absurd lacking meaning

Shout out to the fam who be everyday deenin' (deenin')

[Verse 2: K.O.]

I thought I found heaven, realized it was Hell

Disguised as a happiness, rolling in the deep like Adele

Tryna swim out but it's too deep like a well

In it to steep, I'm asleep, I couldn't tell

Thinking it was a done deal, I thought I found the one

Fifteen years old thinking like I am twenty one

Naive with my schemes, My world felt so sweet

Then we split up, and my world felt concrete

Then days went by, and I felt obsolete

Coupla months passed and head down to my feet

Lookin' so sad, like Sudan in the streets

Lookin' so mad, like a man fasting in the heat

Mama told me never show your tears never sigh

Baba told me be a man no fear in my eyes

Lookin' dumb hard in this atmosphere of lies

Decided that I gotta make this song cry. (make this song cry)

[Verse 3: Cause]

It's all the same grains of sand,Just a different story

Used to board the peter pan, With half a mill in worries

I ran a mill in journeys, that'll have a villian worried

Any family feelin' awry, I must stand to say I'm sorry

If I could I would but, I don't live with should ofs

It made me who I am, Cuz for every time I screwed up

It changed me to a man, And everytime I look up

I'm thankful for that chance, To take another breath and

Take another step and, I miss my moms a lot but, Allah makes the best plans

Tie your boots and prepare for glory

Toast to victory as we share our stories

I'm living proof, Went from pitchn on the stoop

I hustled all my youth, man, All I knew was loot

And now at the end of the day, there's not a day I don't pray

So K.O don't listen to they lies when they say...
