[Intro: K-Rino]
Yeah, you know how I do
K-Rino in the house, S.P.C
I done did the cartoon characters and the cars
So now I'm bout to do these candy bars, you know how I flip it
Murder One in the house, that boy K.O. in here
We chilling in here with my boy Mark
Yo we gon' flip a little story like this, check me out

[Verse 1: K-Rino]
I was chilling with my homeboy Milky Way
He be on the corner 24 hours a day
I met this young hustler by the name of Twix
He was asking a gray owl, how many licks
What it take for a man to make a female cum?
He said, "Hmm let me see" and went and got him some
I stepped to him with a 20 and asked him this
Could you tell me how to find this girl named Hershey Kiss
He said the last time I seen her she was selling her butt
For 35 bucks a hit on a dopefiend cut
If you try to scoop her up, you better handle your bis'
She got a pimp named Snicker and that ass is his
So I hopped in my ride and I flew downtown
To this gun sho, to pick me up a couple of rounds
Of artillery, ain't nobody killing me first
Needed help, so I called my homeboy Starburst
Now my boy wasn't no punk, he packed a punch
Fought this hater named Nestle and his ass got crunched
It was pay day, we knew he had some bank in his hand
Checked his briefcase and inside was 100 grand
When we got to that spot Hershey Kiss was sold
Saw some freaks on the block doing the tootsie roll
They was looking at me crazy, so I got suspicious
Saw two freaks, Blow Pop and Bubblicious, uh

[Hook: K.O.]
We talking 'bout candy
Ooooh-oooh, I'm talking 'bout candy

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
Hershey came back about a hour or so
Riding in a car with my homeboy Z-Ro
I called her name, but she hopped in a long black Caddy
Left with this rich old man, a sugar daddy
Man I got's to follow 'em and learn the truth
Went to a dope house, ran by Big Baby Ruth
I saw this dude named Reeses, a mixed up brother
His daddy was chocolate, but his mama was peanut butter
Walked inside the place, Hershey saw my face
She said man K-Rino, what you do in this space?
I said I came from South Park to put you on lock
But I ain't know that you was out here going hard on the block
All of a sudden all I heard was the sound of a car
It was Snicker, M&Ms and Mr. Goodbar
He said now who is this fool with my woman tryna fade her
When you want your life took boy? Now or later?
They wouldn't let me have her, so I tried to take her
Got my ass whooped by a damn Jawbreaker
Some M&Ms ran up like they was the man
But bullets melted in they mouth from this heat in my hand
That's when my girl Hershey Kiss came out with a pump
Told them fools she set 'em up from the jump
Stacked a half a million and counted our cuts
Starburst cocked up and straight took Snicker's nuts
We raised up and got caught in the middle
Of a gang war between the Lemon Heads and the Skittles
But we made it out of that, it wasn't no thing
They was fighting 'cause somebody got beat for some candy cane
My homie Starburst, he wanted some butt
So he boned Almond Joy 'cause that night he felt like a nut
I looked at Hershey and said baby can I hit that
That's when I stuck my butterfinger in her Kit Kat
Uh

[Hook x2: K.O.]
We talking 'bout candy
Ooooh-oooh, I'm talking 'bout candy

[Outro: Murder One]
Man, we ain't talking 'bout nothing but candy (candy)
Ha-ha-ha (no), OK that's enough of that
