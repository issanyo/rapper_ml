[Verse 1: K-Rino]
I was born on the 9th month, 9th day, '70 I arrived
Down to earth just like my mama but LV gave me my South Park side
I real hustler, got game in his blood
Mama real too, through them I developed two kinds of love
One for that street life but the other for peace
But the two can’t live together, so inside I’m a beast
I’m mystified by the cash flow that I never seen
Partners coming up doing dirt while I’m broke living clean
Know what I mean? Picture being on the cut walking
What I thought was just my conscience on the cool was just the law talking
Telling me I need to live my life legitimate
I’m in the Mr Fiends with money tryna get a hit
I block him out, snatch the paper, pass the rock and shout
"Get off my corner", any shiest manoeuvres, knock him out
No more school, I’m dropping out, pockets popping out
Everything new, me and the crew, yeah I’m talking about that..

[Hook: K.O.]
Street life, hustling for a living
Street life, taking never giving
All night, tryna ease the pain I’m feeling
The world is making it hard on me
Tryna find a way to make it better
Knowing I- we’ve been doing this forever
So I’m down for whatever
The world is making it hard on me

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
I’m tryna turn a dollar into 15 G’s
Got to flip my game 360 degrees
Started asking myself questions, tripping, tryna soul search
Am I a hypocrite for putting dope money in church?
Through the bad I’m tryna do some good
This brother told me when you come up, open up a business in the hood
Never did ‘cause I let the streets make me hard
My mama threw up her hands and said, “Take me Lord”
When she found that sack in my room full of crack
She made me raise out the crib and said, “Don’t come back”
Didn’t faze me ‘cause I knew that the game pays me
Mama brought me in the world but the hood raised me
I’m just a teen tryna live good so understand
Caught in-between a mind of childhood and being a man
I’m losing touch bur never lost the love for the game
My partners feel me ‘cause they going through the same in that…

[Hook: K.O.]
Street life, hustling for a living
Street life, taking never giving
All night, tryna ease the pain I’m feeling
The world is making it hard on me
Tryna find a way to make it better
Knowing I- we’ve been doing this forever
So I’m down for whatever
The world is making it hard on me

[Verse 3: K-Rino]
Picture all them crack pipes with nobody lighting
Picture blacks at a club and nobody fighting
Picture everybody paid with no bother
Picture all babies growing up with a father
I had to stay paid so dirt was my alternative
Went to the Mosque, they told me that I need to learn to live
Positive and never disrespect my own
How the Hell we call ourselves grown and live at home
With mama starting drama talking back and throwing a fit
You better love her while she here ‘cause when she’s gone that’s it
You’re feeling like you wanna change but the chance is slim
You got two kids now you’re tryna live your life through them
Hoping they don’t make the same mistake you made and fail
It took them years to know it’s hard to raise a son in jail
Ain’t nothing new to K-Rino, man I know all about that
We need to unite and do right and raise up out that…

[Hook: K.O.]
Street life, hustling for a living
