[Verse 1: Brother Khalid]

I've been living this life
Like I'm the only chosen one
Making this music for y'all
But the story just begun
It's a heavy spit
By the HEAVY GUNNERS sh*t
I'm almost close to be heard
There's noway I'm gonna quit
Let me try and try, let me see what I'm gon' get
It's the Brother Khalid on the mic, he who never sits
I'm back with these feelings that I'm gonna make it
I'm feeling so real that I ain't gonna fake it
Rap is my protein, I make it and I shake it
Rap is my cake so I bring it and I bake it
Giving it for you so you can leave it or take it
Face it, you can't even top this
You'll die trying to make it
I might lose sometimes but trust me I'll be back
Always on the track like the power in this world is meant to be black
So power up I mean that!


[Verse 2: K'O]

Let's get it done, having fun killing the beat
Smoking some weed, feeling the heat, planting my seeds
On those stupid minds, dumb humans believe it or not
Cause I'm a highly educated nigga like it or not
I've been rapping for a while now living the game
And I'm still in the beginning and I'm feeling no shame
It's like my mind on my music, my music on my mind
Maybe I look hard but I'm so kind, work your mind
Just stand and never sit down, get your demand
And, be the base of the place, the ace and the race
Playing the game without haste
Man all of my life been like copy and paste
I got to be the soldier who's standing in the line
Not fighting for your life son, I'm fighting for mine
I got to shine and open my mind so I'll be fine
I got a strong will, as soon as you feel
And when I shoot then if I shoot to kill


[Verse 3: Brother Khalid]

Ay yo, I'm back again cracking the walls
It's like a new day fellas and I'm scratching my balls
I see some new niggas rapping and I'm takin' em all
You know I'm hating none  of y'all cause you know I have a soul (*Sou da/そう だ*)
Cause I'm the freak serving order I, walk on the road
I, spit like a cobra, take down the odds
I, K H A to the L I D, I'm frightening to y'all like an HIV
Ain't nobody wanna catch an HIV but pain is your fate when you mess with me
So get what you need and respect all the rules
I ain't playing shit niggas, I'm making a duel
Me versus me until I get what I need
I dream a lot even before I dip in a sleep
Keep mines deep, working to reap
Till the day I'll be laughing that I succeed
Laugh at the past, aging so fast
And all around the world flying on the 1st class
Nigga hang on the hope, believe never stop
And one day I shall meet y'all on the top
