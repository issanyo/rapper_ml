[Intro]
My Life

[Verse 1]
Take a look at my life, is there any thing I wanna change
Tomorrow don't have to be the same
If I didn't self medicate, get up off my ass and I'd just get it man
Ain't a lot that the doctor do for me, Sit back peel off the top of a 40
Wondering how long, they was goin' to ignore me
So I climbed up the mountain and I screamed out glory
Its life, its short, its bitter sweet
Turn up the drums so I can hear the symphony
For what I done god ain't forgiving me
Wood on the fire brings smoke

[Hook]
Take a look at my life
Its just a handful of memories
From misdemeanors to felonies
Funerals of family
Look at my life
Ain't exactly what I planned it'd be
And life, Is this really what it's all about?
My life, It ain't no mystery to figure out
My life, I got a couple rhymes I scribbled out
Guess I took a different route
Take a look at my life

[Verse 2]
You can do anything you wanna do
Take a moment of solitude
Before the streets up and swallow you
Get a little back bone and some follow through
And life, It's all about the little things
Its right than give that girl everything
Its love, then give that girl a wedding ring
Don't be scared its time to get settled in
We fight, and I'd lose my temper
I ain't see that man since last December
We was getting high man, Don't you remember
And the wood on the fire burned down to a ember
Why is life, such a painful sacrifice
Why you concerned what goes on in the after life
Cause motherfucker this is chess not checkers
Do your best move if they gonna respect ya
Got your opinion you can think whatever
Staring down the barrel of a grey Beretta
I got my grade 10 man, I ain't clever
Jesus said king sing the truth forever



[Hook]
Take a look at my life
Its just a handful of memories
From misdemeanors to felonies
Funerals of family
Look at my life
Ain't exactly what I planned it'd be
And life, Is this really what it's all about?
My life, It ain't no mystery to figure out
My life, I got a couple rhymes I scribbled out
Guess I took a different route
Take a look at my life
