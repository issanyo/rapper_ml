[Intro]
My memories, I
My memories, I

[Chorus]
My memories came back in the form of someone else
I know this feelin', yes I know this very well
Why won’t you love me now? Why won't you love me now?
Why won't you love me now? (Why won’t you love me now?)

[Verse 1]
Memories
It's gon' take some gettin' used to
Memories
Feel the pain when it hits you
Memories
Don't you ever let them fool you
Don't you ever let them fool you
'Cause I know that you know that it ain't true
I learned the hard way about trust, about us, about us
You sin and be on your high horse, we’re not so stable anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
What’s left if I give you my all?
Give you my all, give you my all
What's left if I give you my all?
Give you my all, give you my all
What’s left if I give you my all?
Give you my all, give you my all
What's left if I give you my all?
Give you my all, give you my all

[Chorus]
My memories came back in the form of someone else
I know this feelin', yes I know it very well
Why won't you love me now? Why won’t you love me now?
Why won't you love me now? Why won't you love me now?

[Bridge]
My memories, I (Ahh)
My memories, why won't you love me now? (Ahh)

[Verse 2]
Stepped over me like a sidewalk
That's your loss, your loss
You self-destruct and I watch, I watch, I watch
Memories
Don't let 'em fool you, baby
Memories
Don't you ever let them fool you
'Cause I know that you know that it ain't true
Lock it up, lock it up, I can't deal with ya
Lock it up, lock it up, take your things witcha
I finally had enough
Out to the ride you go

[Pre-Chorus]
What's left if I give you my all?
Give you my all, give you my all
What's left if I give you my all?
Give you my all, give you my all
What's left if I give you my all?
Give you my all, give you my all
What's left if I give you my all?
Give you my all, give you my all

[Chorus]
My memories came back in the form of someone else
I know this feelin', yes I know it very well
Why won't you love me now? Why won't you love me now?
Why won't you love me now? Why won't you love me now?

[Outro]
Why won't you love me now? Why won't you love me now? (Ahh)
Why won't you love me now? Why won't you love me now? (Ahh)
