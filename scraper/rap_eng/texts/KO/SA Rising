If we can't help ourselves who's gonna help us, who's gonna help us?

Oh dont be selfish

(VERSE one)
Tell me where we going, tell me where we going
I think we loosing it, we need some direction moving forward
This ain't the same rainbow nation that mandela has reknought
The citezens are really getting fed up if you noticing
You see the country depreciating at a rapid pace
Some folks are immigrating tryna get away
We need to continue praying for a better day
Hope this message can go all the way up to the head of state
Dear Mr President, with everything happening in the country hope you understand why some of your residents are panickin
Can be challenging to be patriotic emzansi sometimes when you look at the shenanigans in the cabinet
It is pretty evident how political egos have a negative element in economic development of the nation
Before exiting as the president I believe you still have power to swing the pendulum for the better

(VERSE two)
Showing my appreciation for all different colours of the rainbow nation, yeah
You know we need each other/you know we feel each other
But I wanna take this moment to speak to my brothers and sisters in the spectrum of my fellow people with color
Why are we so divided, can you tell me why are we so divided?
We could be stronger if we were more united
A lot of hate is ignited in our hearts when we see a neighbor doing well but as soon as he fails we get excited
Better get up and play your position and play your position
In 2017 you shouldn't be playing victim, instead of making excuses you should be making decisions on how to change your condition
Blaming the system won't be making a difference
Its embarrassing how we notorious for prejudice on fellow Africans when they came over here to make a living
Laziness should be your phobia but why are you simply resorting to xenophobia, mntom'nyama?

(VERSE three)
You rappers need to be more socially conscious with your voices
You flexing on every verse and every chorus
We should be playing our role as the reporters of the stories of our people
We one of the strongest forces for change
Social economic is causing **** in all the corners of the country
Children and hungry people are dying while we busy taking for granted  and misusing the power of our influence
You know your role in the constituent and everything you bring to it
