[Intro: K-Rino]
They say a woman is a H.O.E., I hear you, G
If them initials stand for Heaven on Earth, then I'll agree
They say a woman means H.O.E., that's cool with me
If them initials stand for Heaven on Earth, then I'll agree

[Verse 1: K-Rino]
Straight from God, a gift to bring calm to the storm
Soft and warm female, Heaven in human form
Black queen, her touch is like energy from the Sun
Can't imagine life without her 'cause it wouldn't be none
My respect for you seems to increase with time
Blessed to find one who gives me constant piece of mind
Stress free which lets me overcome struggle and grief
A sacred specimen creation beyond belief
Her beautiful conversations like songs from a bird
Hidden power deep enough to move mountains with a word
React as if I ain't seen black women in days
I'm overpowered and phased by sweet feminine ways
Darkness come I find you bring light to the mind
Memories of you rewind time, give sight to the blind
Keeping learning about each other it remain new and fresh
Let our souls merge together till we transcend the flesh

[Chorus: K.O.]
It's like Heaven on Earth when you're around
After all the things we been through we still down
You show love for me (love for me), even when I'm wrong
You give me so much in my life you keep me strong

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
Ready to face whatever God plans to stay together
God leading the way so we ain't scared to pray together
Whatever you're past holding baby, never mind that
Let's take the word relationship and redefine that
Never ever disrespect her, that's the ultimate rule
To curse a woman is to curse your own existence fool
It don't matter if she yell or caramel pitch black
I be feeling what you thinking just through eye contact
Able to take a man, civilized him when he was wild
And reproduce a copy of him in the form of his child
Your like the Sun in the daytime and the Moon at night
Universal life, I see you and my thoughts take flight
And if it's real we gon' step it up when trouble appears
And every second that we spend apart gon' seem like years
My life is gon' be judged by the way that I treat ya
Let’s start over boo, my name is K-Rino, it's nice to meet ya
Like Heaven

[Chorus: K.O.]
It's like Heaven on Earth when you're around
After all the things we been through we still down
You show love for me (love for me), even when I'm wrong
You give me so much in my life you keep me strong

[Verse 3: K-Rino]
Your life story got to be one developed in stages
Y'all can't write the same book if you on 2 different pages
Understand, it ain't about material stuff
If you don't stimulate her mind then the world ain't enough
She down to earth but if I’m in the wrong, quick to get brave
Knowing how to be submissive without being a slave
The consolation that I'm needing when she feeding my soul
Cast my words into the Universe and let 'em unfold
Anything I'm tryna get done, she ready to roll
The most beautiful vision two eyes could ever behold
Knowing she will be the one from the second we meet
I strive to elevate and place the Universe at her feet
Every day is mother’s day so don't ever forget it
Tryna keep it real and do better by staying committed
From body, soul to mind she divine by design
Just to keep her safe, I'm down to place my life on the line

[Chorus: K.O.]
It's like Heaven on Earth when you're around
After all the things we been through we still down
You show love for me (love for me), even when I'm wrong
You give me so much in my life you keep me strong

[Outro: K.O.]
Girl, you know you're like Heaven, Heaven, Heaven...
The things you do for me to satisfy me baby baby
