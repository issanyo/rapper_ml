[Verse 1: K.O.]
I'm quick to pick pieces of my troubled youth and stack em'
Napkins overlapping, lapping up the vocals of the cheetahs and hyenas laughing holding up, my core is spazzing out
Cold chills through my spine its like im camping out
Capping out at loud, I gotta amp the sound
Stomp the ground like the walls of my insignia are crashing down
Falling all around, I ease into a hurdle, only thing that I can count on are the people in my inner circle
And my pride, that inner drive, never live to try, never live a lie
Never live to die cause I'd be dead alive
Its either genocide, or energize, my enterprise
Surprisingly is easing on the throttle yo
Blessed is the one who's infected cause his intestines is messing with messages and lessons that he had to swallow so
Keep your thirst, and feed your first
Ambitions and visions forever living in the depths of your prison

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ray Endeavor]
Yo its ironic, I go about my days like nothings changed
But my mentality constantly shifts going against the grain
And thats something you can't obtain, you develop it
That intelligence expands until your cerebral cortex envelops it
And I be playing it off like nothing phases me
But at the end of the day I feel thats just a crazy me
A hollow shell that people can see, but never tell
On what craziness lies on the inside of this male
Can I win, will I prevail on the tribulations of life?
I don't know, but Ima give it my best shot despite-
What you have to say about me, I don't give 2 fucks if you doubt me
I'm a rebel on another level, go against me and we will settle-
Any disputes that you may have
You're just a bump in the road blocking my lucrative path
It's a rap, and I ain't talkin seran
Don't meddle with the devil fuckin up God's plan
You won't need a shovel to dig what I'm sayin

[Hook]

[Verse 3: K.O.]
Who said my destiny was set in stone?
I'll be damned if let the man set the tone
Say I can't, now my hands...ticked off like a metronome
Now whos gone tell me that this...kid can't even kick a flow?
Or tell me the way i speak, won't bring the heat even when it snows
Spittin out my soul till the reapers crow out
Zone out to my inner haven, hold up, haters hating
They dont want a piece, decapitate em
But really jokes aside, im feeling hope inside
Been feelin hope since I,saw the world with open eyes
I'm cutting up these lines, laced with the dopest rhymes
Freeze ipods when you press play, two peas in a pod or how you say cause
See me and Ray, we kind of the same, double D's on our brain, for a dime or a dame Might come off as insane or as cold as december
But by the end of today, you gon remember our names (learn it!)

[Outro]
Man I can't stop/ know I won't drop
God I gotta keep going till my hands lock and grip hold
Till the sweat trickle down my cheek
I'm knee deep in the creek where the seas meet
Scratch back till the tales turn
Then repeat like your favorite verse, till the cradles burst
Leave a trail of hurst, I'm insane or worse, im alive with no high
