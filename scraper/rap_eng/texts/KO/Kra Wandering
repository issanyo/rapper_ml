[Verse 1: Benny Okoto]
Look in the eyes
See that they gone
Smile throw them off
Trial and the error the fairer have lost
The peril a hero will fall
Look in my eyes
See what I do want
Straight face see where you've come
See where you've been
Really what's right
Where went wrong
Huey Issac Newton
Really student
Don't make sense really stupid
Saw you on the floor Captain Morg playing cupid
Way too high no dreams become lucid
Physically fit and the shape of the mind Martin Luther
This a revolution New England with the nooses
Kick game World Cup one chance and you gone lose it
Babygal just hold my drink let a young nigga think
Young nigga mack constructs of life let my young niggas sink
Getting way too deep say I'm way too deep
Tryna make it hurt
Pleasure with the pain and damn I put in work
Phillip Lahm off the turf
And we outta of this world till we off of this Earth (off of this Earth)

[Chorus]
Lost soul (lost soul)
Lost soul (lost soul)
Know anything's possible (anything's possible)
Lost soul (lost soul)
Lost soul (lost soul)
Lost soul (lost soul)
Lost soul (all my lost souls)
Out of this world (all my lost souls)
Off of this Earth (lost soul, lost soul)
Peace

[Verse 2: K.O.]
I'm not concerned with the afterlife
I'm like too young to think about what's after life
But too old to not acknowledge Christ
Ain't sleep but I was born before Christ
You might think I'm off my rocker
Soul of a rasta who blunts roll proper
Fuck how I feel odds against I keep the even keel
As long as everything
Good with my partnas
Ball like KD MVP to my mama (uh)
Comeback of the year to my papa
I'm, searching for hidden meanings and greenscreens
Just to know the unvierse is one with me
Could be off Bobby and the Whitney
But I'd much rather let the liquour get me
Let anything in the party temp me
And let the devil get me but he can't spend me
