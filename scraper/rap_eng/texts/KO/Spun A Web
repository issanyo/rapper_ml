[Intro: Ja Rule]
Love thy hater
You know they say everything we hear is an opinion, not fact
And everything we see is perspective, not truth
The fewer the facts, the stronger the opinions
And opinion is the medium between knowledge and ignorance, bitch

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
I’m hoping that Heaven got a ghetto
So when I get there I can tell you to kiss my ass whole hearted
I'm back where I started
I'm a prisoner of my own success, but hardly
Caring enough to know that I’m dead without it
No cribs, no cars, no champagne
No bright lights, no bitches, no big stage
But fuck it, I'm in a better place
And I'm talking in third person in case you couldn't relate
Diary of a monster, sometimes my mind fades
To a place not even I can explain
'Cause there's a thin line between genius and insane
Guess which one I am, I think it’s obvious that

They spun a web, for me
Like a spider, they spun a web, for me
And they spun a web, for me
Like a spider, they spun a web, for me

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
And I say that to say this, man, if life is a bitch
I’m gon' fuck her then tell her that I love her
Not beneath her or above her, but inside, no rubber
That's my interpretation of motherfucker
No lie, no truth my life is a little bit of both
Who’s who? Who knows anymore?
My choice is to get it in real moist so I can come hard
And the world is ours, better yet, bitch, mines
Shot at the moon just to be among stars
Then God alienated it and ended up on Mars
Serenity understand it, extraterrestrial, that I is
Think I do it all because, it’s obvious

[Hook: Amina]
They spun a web, for me
Like a spider, they spun a web, for me
And they spun a web, for me
Like a spider, they spun a web, for me

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Lately, I’m seeing my whole life ahead of me
And I’m feeling like this life can never be (nah)
'Cause a nigga on a whole 'nother pedigree (from ya)
I’m so far from home it feels like a million miles
And I’m long gone and ain’t no coming back
But really I never left
I’ve been silent yet at my the best
Y’all haters spread hatred like yawning
And I still find ways to make crochet hearts
Like Kanye my 808′s is a heartbreaker's
Maybe me singing to your hearts a mistake
Nah, Maybe I’m just before my time
Or maybe it’s just that obvious

[Hook: Amina]
They spun a web, for me
Like a spider, they spun a web, for me
And they spun a web, for me
Like a spider, they spun a web, for me
