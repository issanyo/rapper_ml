[Verse 1]
Baby got a little problem
With the drugs, man
And I tried to stop her, well
But she loves them
But I can’t do nothing as one man
Her nose keeps on bleeding but it’s, but it’s, but it’s nothing
And I won’t forget when, when she said

[Hook]
I lick a ring around this L so that it burns all night
And I pass round that philly so, so, so we can all get high
You see I never knew
I never had a clue that
That you were capable of love
That you were capable of love
So lick a ring around your L, so that it burns all night
And I pass round that philly so, so, so we can all get high

[Verse 2]
If baby keep on thinking, well, she gonna hurt herself
Baby keeps on drinking cause she lost all her wealth
Yeah, she love that liquor
She wanna have my kids
But this ain’t my problem
But B-Jesus says it is
And I won’t forget when, when she said

[Hook]
I lick a ring around this L so that it burns all night
And I pass round that philly so, so, so we can all get high
You see I never knew
I never had a clue that
That you were capable of love
That you were capable of love
So lick a ring around your L, so that it burns all night
And I pass round that philly so, so, so we can all get high

[Verse 3]
I’m so glad you informed me
Her strong point was never loyalty
Bitch never done shit for me
I had to leave her, and
Well now she’s just another story
When we pass around that 40
And she says she’s so sorry
Well I don’t believe her

[Hook]
I lick a ring around this L so that it burns all night
And I pass round that philly so, so, so we can all get high
You see I never knew
I never had a clue that
That you were capable of love
That you were capable of love
So lick a ring around your L, so that it burns all night
And I pass round that philly so, so, so we can all get high
