[Chorus: MC Magic (Talkbox) & K.O]
Even Though I Know That The World
Changes Every Day
Sometimes It Seems Like Things Will Never Ever Change (Never Change)
I Need To Get Away (Get Away)
People Never Change
So I'm Gunning For A Better Better Day

[Verse 1: Stomper]
As I Hustle Through The Night
We Struggle For Days
I Bow My Head & I Pray
Ask God To Show Me The Way
Life Is Precious Ese
Better Count All Your Blessings
Tried To Stay Humble Through My Troubles
And Control My Aggression
But Life Lessons Got Me Stressing
Need Some Kind Of Escape
The Kinda Of Place To Raise My Family
Cause The City Ain't Safe
Sometimes It Seems Like A Trap
And There's No Way Out
The City Of Lost Angels
Is The Devil's Playground
Life Ain't A Joke When You're Broke
They Try To Say That You're Buggin
Down On Your Luck
Can Leave You Stuck
And Homie Where Is The Love At?
Trying To Make Something Out Of Nothing
Running A Muck & I'm Hustling
Ain't Too Many You Could Trust
When The Balas 'ill Bust You
When Will I Finally Be Free?
Is There A Heaven For A G?
Or Will My Brain Forever Be
In This Deadly Disease
Insanity Is What It Seem
Ain't No Gangster Relief
Cause All My Struggles & Troubles
Got Me Away Too Deep

[Chorus: MC Magic (Talkbox) & K.O]
Even Though I Know That The World
Changes Every Day
Sometimes It Seems Like Things Will Never Ever Change (Never Change)
I Need To Get Away (Get Away)
People Never Change
So I'm Gunning For A Better Better Day

[Verse 2: Stomper]
Hard Times Ain't Nothin'
The Streets Getting Bloody
I Put My Soul In This Song
There Ain't No Taking It From Me
Land Of Milk & Honey
Motivated By Money
Stack A Little Chips
And Everybody's Acting Funny
Little Kids Pack Guns
And Grow Up Fast In These Streets
And I'm Surrounded On The Daily
By These Killers & Thieves
And Lord Knows
I Grew Up Among These Skull & Bones
Grave Stones, Ghost Stones
Got Me Lost In The Zone
I Stand Alone
Trying To Make It Back Home
Tattoos On The Dome & My Pistol With Chrome
And Even Though Things Change
Somethings Will Always Be The Same
Ain't No Shame In My Game
You Gon' Remember My Name
That's On The Real
I Got My Freedom & Health
Only Friends End Up Pretend
But I'm Weeding Em Out
I Pray To God It Never Doubts
Like My Time Is Running Out
Stack Chips In Major Amounts
Because That's What I'm About

[Chorus: MC Magic (Talkbox) & K.O]
Even Though I Know That The World
Changes Every Day
Sometimes It Seems Like Things Will Never Ever Change (Never Change)
I Need To Get Away (Get Away)
People Never Change
So I'm Gunning For A Better Better Day

[Verse 3: Stomper]
Dear Lord Can You Help Me?
Cause I'm Struggling Again
Buried Another One Of My Friends
When Will This Misery End?
Gots To Deal
So My Soul With The Cheapest Of Thrills
Got Scars Under My Skin
Don't Think They Ever Goin' Heal
That's Real
Cause I Can Feel It In Me
Ese I'm Hurt
I Did My Dirt & Now I'm Lost
Trying To Run From These Curtains
But I'm Tired & I'm Ready
Steady Praying For Hope
My Baby Momma Smoking Dope
Life In The City Of Ghost
My Homie's Locked Up In The SHU
What Can I Do?
But Count My Blessings
Trying To Distress All By Less
But These Cowards Keep Testing
Ain't Forgot About The Homies
Laying Deep In The Graves
Spending Their Days In The Cave
Every Day Is The Same
Leaving In Shame
When Will it Change?
Where I'm Going Is Heaven
Since The Beginning Life Was Like This
Man My City Was Deadly
At The End Of My Road
Trying To Cope With The Sadness
Living So Sick & So Savage
Lost In This World Of Madness

[Chorus: MC Magic (Talkbox) & K.O]
Even Though I Know That The World
Changes Every Day
Sometimes It Seems Like Things Will Never Ever Change (Never Change)
I Need To Get Away (Get Away)
People Never Change
So I'm Gunning For A Better Better Day
