[Chorus: K.O.]
Do you even miss me at all?
Watch how we shine like the moon and the stars!
Don't act like you don't miss me at all
Even though I shine like the moon and the stars!

[Verse 1: Daetrius]
Something like the Pokémon
I been searching for glow
Donatello Versace, no these no common clothes
European playing fields, no these no common goals
Went from 10 whips on the Amistad to 10 whips in a row
Blowing on Khalifa, bitch bald like Amber Rose
Coke line match her toes paint white as the Grammy show
Her ass rode equestrian ride me to comatose
Might throw her in the Kentucky Derby just for the show
Illuminate her walls
Precipitation her drawls
Thought the world was in my palms
But really it's in my balls
No roam on the Apple, but Eve is praying for fall
(No roam on the Apple, but Eve is praying for fall)

[Hook: K.O]
Do you even miss me at all?
Watch how we shine like the moon and the stars!
Don't act like you don't miss me at all
Even though I shine like the moon and the stars!

[Verse 2: Daetrius]
Looking out of Cartier lens I know that the world mine
Yellow dime with me I bought out the sunshine
I dun even want it unless it's one of a kind
I dun really do the nine 'less eleven is right behind
Dripping on the floor more game than Super Bowl
Chanel on her choke she got some expensive throat
I’m far from the player I call it just like a coach
When I'm talking in the huddle you won’t hear a word spoke
We far from some dummies we really doing our math
21, 21, all we doing is add
42 to Fairfax all of em in the bag
It been 7 days straight still caught in the jet lag…..

[Hook: K.O]
Do you even miss me at all?
Watch how we shine like the moon and the stars!
Don't act like you don't miss me at all
Even though I shine like the moon and the stars!
Do you even miss me at all?
Do you even miss me at all?
