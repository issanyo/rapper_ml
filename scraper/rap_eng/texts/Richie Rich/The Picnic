[Verse 1]
It’s time to bust one, to get the people pumped
It’s the 90's, the season of the Humpty Hump
Summer’s almost here, so ay, it’s time to do it
The man on the mic is Richie Rich, I thought you knew it
Summertime, a time to cool it with the ladies
The beaches are on, brothas strikin’ the Mercedes
Lots of ladies love me and a few that you can get with
Come along to Richie Rich’s picnic

[Chorus 1]
The Picnic, the Richie Rich picnic
Come on to Richie Rich picnic
It’s the picnic, the Richie Rich picnic
Come on, everybody let’s go to the picnic
The Richie Rich picnic
Give it up, give it up, we’re going to the picnic
The Richie Rich picnic

[Verse 2]
Now at the picnic, there’ll be lots of food
And some drink as well to get the ladies in the mood
We’re just chillin’, though, you know, no violence
We’re all in a park so who cares about silence
Loungin’, you know what I’m sayin’?
My potna Kirk, he’s at the keyboards playin’
And it’s on, we’ve got the barbecue
And the field setup for a game of horseshoe
Or some Frisbee, or catch, more maybe even football
I threw the picnic just for that reason, so would y’all
Get busy with me one time on the one
Daryl, count it off, it’s time to have some fun

[Chorus 2]
At the picnic, the Richie Rich picnic
We’re eatin’ barbecue, man, we’re gonna go
At the picnic, the Richie Rich picnic
Come on, grab a girl and just bring her
To the picnic, the Richie Rich picnic
We ain’t trippin’, just kickin’ it, man
We’re at the picnic, the Richie Rich picnic
And you know it’s like this

[Verse 3]
The picnic’s hot, it’s movin’, it’s happenin’
My guest goin’ soon, hit the mic and start rappin’
His name’s H.M., but you can call him The Hype
He gets juiced, and he’s just that type
For my picnic, to move the crowd with a stogie
Some danger to the ranger, this basket’s for Yogi
I’m firin’ it off now for a bite to eat
So, yo, H.M, give the picnic a peek

[Chorus 3 (H.M. the Hype Man)]
It’s the picnic, the Richie Rich picnic
Come on, yeah. (What’s uuuppp?)
The picnic, the Richie Rich picnic; come on, come on, come on (repeat 3x)
(Talking over chorus: It’s yo potna, the Hype Man. I’m on my way to the picnic, you know what I’m sayin’? I’m gettin’

Closer and closer. The closer I get, I hear the music. I feel the hype. I’m fixin’ to get busy, you know what I’m sayin’?)

[Verse 4 (H.M. the Hype Man)]
It’s the Hype Man, I need a girlie to get wit’
So I’mma strike straight to the picnic
And kick it tough, like my potna said
To lounge with Richie Rich and young JED
At the picnic, the girlies are movin’
I’m The Hype, and I keep on groovin’
Just a freestyle, I need a girl to get wit’
What’s uuuppp…with the Richie Rich picnic?
I’m straight loungin’, man, I’m gettin’ hype
Just on the strength, I’m just that type
I get to rappin’, I got a girl, now I’m rollin’
Just on strength, the hype keeps controllin’
The mic, and people say I get crazy
I don’t trip, I don’t let words phase me
I’m hyped, and I got my girl, I’m leavin’
Peek it out, no tricks up my sleeve and
What’s up, is a code I use
I never trip, I never blow a fuse
Because I strike, when I peek a mic
The picnic’s on and I’m so damn hype
It’s summertime, and man I’m juiced
Straight on the grass about to get loose
With the football, the Frisbee, and even a kite
The Hype Man, he’s ‘bout to do it right

At the picnic, the Richie Rich picnic
What’s uuuppp? We’re on our way to the picnic
The Richie Rich picnic, come on, come on, come on
Everybody’s at the picnic, the Richie Rich picnic
Come on, come on, come on
Everybody’s at the picnic, the Richie Rich picnic
The Hype Man, he’s kickin’ it at
The picnic, the Richie Rich picnic
And Richie Rich is kickin’ it, man
At his picnic, the Richie Rich picnic
Come on, come on, come on
It’s just a picnic, a Richie Rich picnic
Come on, come on, come on
Everybody let’s come to the picnic
The Richie Rich picnic
Peace, we up outta here
