[Chorus]
Ruff neckin' on this track like a mack with the double
Flossin' on that ass ("Now you know you in trouble")

[Verse 1]
If A is for apple and J is for jack
Then why so many brothas claim they wantin’ to roll a sack
They get they first zipper, cut it up in rocks
Sack it up in bags, then it’s off to the block
Everything is tight while the day is right and sunny
Homie gettin’ to smilin’ ‘cause he makin’ a little money
But what about when it rains and the task get to jackin’
That’s when you see that brotha game start lackin’
Err, uh, duh, I’d like to tell you where he dwells
The color of his car and the poison that he sells
It’s called crackola, he’s snitchin’ on the dry
It ain’t like he a punk but now that jail thing ain’t fly
What if they bend him over and hit it from the back?
And Mr. Officer? He finna take you to the sack
That’s the way it goes when you foolin’ with these snitches
I’m back for Ninety…and I’m wantin’ is my riches

[Chorus]
Ruff neckin' on this track like a mack with the double
Flossin' on that ass ("Now you know you in trouble")
Ruff neckin' on this track like a mack with the double
Flossin' on that ass ("Now you know you in trouble")

[Verse 2]
One, two, I’m bucklin’ my shoe
Three, four, I’m finna hit the floor
Five, six, I’m picking up the sticks
‘Cause these tricks in my mix need to miss with that bullsh…
I don’t trot but I stomp like a horse
Women give me my props, top notch, and, of course
You know I’m gettin’ faded, young and old, fat or slim
Them kids belong to him ‘cause I did her with a jim
I’m never caught dippin’, no, I’m playin’ ‘em like a sport
No monkey wrench tramp is finna run me through them courts
And prove to the judge that the double ain’t straight
‘Cause me, myself and I, punk, we fade ‘em from the gate
The last three cats that a tramp wants to meet
And if you talkin’ sh…, you got to give me four feet
Go get an education, and when you get it, let me know
And let them gold teeth and that beeper thang go
‘Cause now it’s now it’s ninety…, it’s time for Rich to bust a grape
And if you want a sack, run and buy this hype tape
Remember that voice that came in ’89 bumpin’
Throwin’ styles, it ain’t no future in your frontin’
Don’t get it twisted, I keep my thang on tight
‘Cause in the sideshow, I took you sideways to the next light
Yeah, that’s me, the R, the I, the C
The H, to the I, uh, to the E
It’s young Rich, baby, and ain’t a damn thang changed
My Cutlass bumps and, yeah, I’m still in them dice games
So what they hittin’ foe? I dig this stock
And it’s my block, so back up, mark, this is my knock
And I’mma serve ‘em wit’ love
And if push comes to shove, I’mma give this brotha two dubs
‘Cause I love to see ‘em bubble
And if you cross the double, boy, you know you in trouble

[Chorus]
Ruff neckin' on this track like a mack with the double
Flossin' on that ass ("Now you know you in trouble")
Ruff neckin' on this track like a mack with the double
Flossin' on that ass ("Now you know you in trouble")

[Verse 3]
See, I’m like Rumple-stil-big-bad-skin, with AK-47s and Mac-10s
And 11s, 12-shot 9s don’t work
‘Cause really a brotha need rounds to do some dirt
Out in this izz-O, don’t get your head rolled, young ass…
Tryna fool wit’ a bigga figga
The D-U-double B-EL, don’t mix me up with C.L
And anything I do, punk, we keepin’ it on the DL
I’m in the game strong, slangin’ the game, gettin’ a half-a-thang
Slappin’ them bones and servin’ straight stones
Flippin’ Irocs on thee tops, ‘cause that’s the way that we ride
Ain’t no G-ride, but I’m down to take thee ride
All through the Town to serve a knot
And if I got, I’ll ride my big block
‘Cause 5-0s, they be on big jock
And ain’t nothin’ like the Crown Vic gettin’ used by the slapstick
As I say ‘peace’ to Suzy Chapstick
I’m out, ready to swerve straight to 580
And ain’t no sense in stoppin’ ‘cause my L's is shady
And uh, they would love to fluke up on a brotha like the double
("Now you know you in trouble")

[Chorus]
Ruff neckin' on this track like a mack with the double
Flossin' on that ass ("Now you know you in trouble")
Ruff neckin' on this track like a mack with the double
Flossin' on that ass ("Now you know you in trouble")
Ruff neckin' on this track like a mack with the double
Flossin' on that ass ("Now you know you in trouble")

Ruff neckin’ on the track...
Flossin’ on that ass ("Baby…too loc’ed out")
