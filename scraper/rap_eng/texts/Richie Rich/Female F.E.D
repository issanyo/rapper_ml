[Verse 1]
I would hope that you are clue-in’ this, ‘cause I’m pursuin’ this
My manager’s money, keeps me doin’ this
I’m a Trojan when it comes to rhyme
I’d be a Bulova, if I were made to keep time
But I’m a rapper, so my title is an M.C
I’m from the O-A-K-L-A-N-D
Sunny California if you know what I mean
West Coast, baby boy, where the walls are clean
Uzis packed, so don’t talk smack
The crew’s 12-deep, you’re bound to get jacked
Makin’ money, yes, in the city of O
Wakin’ up every morning tryna clock that dough
So many gifts, from the grind
Ragtop Beamers to the drop 6-9
I can’t walk a block, without my gat
And the reason being: it’s just like that
Payin’ lawyers case after case
And to soothe the pain, I need the studio’s bass
Every day I read the news, dope game blues
Two brothas killed on a joyride cruise
Front-page story, way too heavy
Teenagers found dead in a 6-9 Chevy

[Verse 2]
Just the other day, I don’t why
I got at this woman in a Samurai
Her jeep was red, the top was white
We made a date, for Saturday night
Well, Saturday came and I just couldn’t wait
To take this girl on a hot date
So I took a trip, to the mall
To get a fresh brand new kit, shoes and all
Wad in my pocket, about 2 G’s
Conrad’s beepin’, jockin’ me
Too much business and too little time
It’s a quarter to 8 and my date’s at 9
Should I kick it with the money or should I wait?
With a pocket full of cash, I’d sure feel great
Rushed to the house, showered, changed my clothes
Then I got my butler, to clean the vogues
The Beamer’s cool, but it’s too legit
So on this mission, I’ll squat Biarritz
Got to her house, one minute late
She opened up the door, lookin’ great
Her hair real long and the outfit Guess
But me in the kit, I was way too fresh
I led her to the car, politely opened the door
Reserved dinner, and then we flew to the show
When the show was over, it was time to eat
But in my pants, I felt my meat
Startin’ to grow to a larger size
As I stared at her creamy thighs
She didn’t say much but she asked a lot
That’s when I thought it was a plot
Could a girl like her fall for me? Of course
But I kept thinkin’ she was part of the force
So we skipped dinner and went to her room
A brotha like me, I couldn’t wait to groom
Within ten minutes, I’d be in the cooler
Pumpin’ and pantin’ like a raw old schooler
‘Cause that’s just part of the Oakland game
Ten minutes to the cooler and I don’t know the name
She gave her name, then dropped the Guess
The big camisole sure did impress
I pumped for hours and fell asleep
And woke up straight in questioning
I was steamin’, my face dark red
Got juiced for a date with a female fed
So they questioned me, answered my pager’s calls
And this was the start of my downfall
I got 7-to-10 for tax evasion
But I got away with three because of lawyer’s persuasion
Three years went by, pockets way in the red
My first phone call was to a man named JED
He hooked me up with some studio time
‘Cause he knew I had more than a talent to rhyme
D dropped some beats, I added some lyrics
And now it’s on the market so the people can hear it

She was a female fed (x2)
