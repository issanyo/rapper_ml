[Intro: D-Loc & Richie Rich]
D-Loc: Yo, Rich, man, what’s up?
RR: I can’t call it. What’s up?
D-Loc: Peep this, man. We done been so hyped on this teenage life, we ain’t been trippin’ off the real hype
RR: Well, it’s like this, man; every time I get ready to step out into the real world, the hype be so deep, I have to just step back off, you know?
D-Loc: Well, man, I got a little somethin’ I wanna tell these people
RR: Well, it’s like this: I got your back. Spit it when you ready
D-Loc: Ay, I’m ready

[Verse 1: D-Loc]
All I wanna know is what’s really happenin’
So put it to me straight and stop kickin’ it backwards
The paper takes things out of shape and proportion
So never trust the news or a TV reporter
We all heard the story of the young black soldiers
Missing in action is what the media told us
But think for a second, it’s your brain that they’re wreckin’
Who sent us on a mission so unpleasant?
Lookin’ down on a brotherman, the other man’s scam
To keep us in a daze, and never understand what’s really goin’ on
So me and Richie Rich wrote a song and we called it the Media Hype

[Verse 2: Richie Rich]
The Media Hype is a song, we composed it
Black for black, stay strong, we’ll expose it
Reporters only say what they are paid to say
So for the truth, we have find another way to play
The game that they are playing with minds of the nation
We have to slow the flow of the false information
A black man found dead? And it’s been stated if he’s carrying a pager, well, it’s drug-related
The news only televises black destruction
Turf wars, drugs and self-corruption
See, I ain’t really with that, ‘cause that ain’t all that’s goin’ on
You know what I’m sayin’, homes?
What about the brothas who stand for somethin’? And they are ample
Pause for a moment and peep the example
George Washington Carver, a brilliant black man
Martin Luther was a brotha with a plan
Tony Brown, who’s strong and in existence
Jesse Owens, athletic, he ran the distance
Too many to mention, and yo, they can’t handle, though
Strong people such as Maya Angelou
I’m tired of the way we’re being stereotyped
So that's why I’m kickin’, the Media Hype

[Verse 3: D-Loc]
Another situation by me being a black man
They formed an organization called the Ku Klux Klan
They programmed themselves to watch us fail
But we’re the youth of today, so make way
Instead of giving us a chance or helping with us plans, no
You’d rather see me in a cage like an animal
The year is ’90, so peace and unity is what I want to see in my community
Don’t let the good things fool ya, D-Loc is here to school ya
Before my rhyme is over, you shall know, that’s the Media Hype

[Verse 4: Richie Rich]
Get it straight from the gate, I drink Ol’ 8
Brothas wanna kick it, but now it’s too late
Studio sessions have fully hyped it
I shook it right off when they stereotyped it
The media clique, you know, the evildoers
The big bad wolfs, not the yayers, but the booers
The punks with the hookup to kill at will
The ones who pump up the fake and hold back the real
It’s astonishing how the media does this
Stun you with a gun and then you say, "Who was this?"
That taxed your record, or maybe held down the publishing
To put it in short, they stopped you from bubbling up
In an industry of millions
And treated you like penny-ante punk civilians
An innocent man awaits trial
He’s on lockdown for a charge that was foul
All in an effort to get stripes
Now that’s the hype, plus the stereotype

RR: You know what I’m sayin’?
D-Loc: Brotha, I understood every word
RR: It’s like this, man; the media hype is wrong, man. You oughta read what they print in the paper about these brothas, man
D-Loc: Ay, man, I know what’s going on. Tell me this: how come when a brotha get killed, the media can’t let him rest in peace, huh?
RR: I don’t know, man. Like I said, man; it’s the media hype, we’ve been stereotyped, and that’s why we kick this, you know?
D-Loc: So I wanna send a peace out across the nation
RR: To everybody, from the 415
