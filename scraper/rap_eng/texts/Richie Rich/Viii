[Intro]
(Cough)
(Clears throat)
Woo
What it do, what it do, what it do

[Hook]
Silver surfing through tell'em miss me with the bullshit
Different swaggy, fuck a trend, we be the cool kids
Dropping Lucy, Mary lifted, straight up hypie living
All the shit they tell you not to do, my only mission
Silver surfing through tell'em miss me with the bullshit
Different swaggy, fuck a trend, we be the cool kids
Dropping Lucy, Mary lifted, straight up hypie living
All the shit they tell you not to do, my only mission

[Verse 1]
Steady sparker, Peter Parker, webbing up all this Mary Jane
Diamonds In The Sky, sugar lines enter my brain
Got Hi With A Little Help From My Friends, I wasn't alone
Yo somebody call Paul, I think I found Lennon, or it's his fucking clone
She's Leaving Home cause her mother won't let her boyfriend bone
A Day In The Life, When I'm Sixty-Four I hope I feel this nice
Real life rock band rocked out to the Beatles shit
Relax feel the music enjoy yourself only good vibes on the trip

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We live for the wildest nights and don't sleep for days
Staying heavily medicated helps relieve the pressure out my way
Dehydrated minds pillow talking over a line of ye
Condine addict, pop a xanny, sipping syrup soda
Keep my niggas limited, my hoes interested
Living in an odyssey, I think I"m Odysseus
Industry fake as fuck, they use you for some dividends
Then on to the next act when you ain't bringing in the Benjamin's

[Hook 2x with Jus Jay]

[Outro]
Yeah, I had to
Long hair and a mother fucking beard nigga
Hahaha
Yeah, don't hate
Just fuck with it
One more time, lets go
