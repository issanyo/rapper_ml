(Guy) What I don't want to see, I just wanna, I just wanna...
(Richie Rich) Check this out man, come on over here I wanna show you something

[Hook]
I used to sell crack rock
But now I'm an MC
I put the rhymes to beats
I used to slang them rocks
I used to sell crack rocks
But now I'm an MC
I put the rhymes to beats
I used to move them rocks
Check this out

[Verse 1: Richie Rich]
It went from 10 dollar power
To cash on the top
With plastic under that
I made a gain of scratch
Kilo's two a week
Through the street
Could ya picture my voice
Pushin over sick beats
I be the first nigga rappin
My shit did really happen
Drunk drivin while I'm 415'in
Sideways to the could of would of should of
And in the first
But have the first get it worst
He did'nt have a nigga, with the real pedigre
Her baby in this shit
But I'm so Ol' G
Fell threw it, True to it
How could I be new to a nigga if I'm hipin you threw it
When you blew to it
Like my nigga's say "Greed"
Could speak on but can't stay a week on it
Chop and Ounze down, and take a walk with me
I'll show you what I did before I was an MC

[Hook]
I used to sell crack rock
But now I'm an MC
I put the rhymes to beats
I used to move them rocks
I used to sell crack rocks
But now I'm an MC
I put the rhymes to beats
I used to slang them rocks

[Verse 2: Richie Rich]
{*police alarms*) Now the little things in your hair
See the man, in the south
Turn around and throw them in your mouth
Don't swallow, unless we brake and he follow
It's the last resource to keep your ass outta court
No support
Let's blow the reefer
Out here it's cheaper
To hook my nigga up with the greefer
My bad
See the ones that look like front teeth
You snatch three this nigga bout to hit you with the 50
You slip 10, but don't let that small money
Be the reason you never see tall money
It's all money
The quicker the roll
The quicker the cock
The quicker the cock
You relize the game don't stop
You loose a 100
And we ain't walked half a block
Money movin faster then the hands on your clock
Now you see what pops
On these California blocks
Before I was a rapper
I was that nigga sellin rocks

[Hook]
I used ta sell crack rock
But now I'm an MC
I put the rhymes to beats
I used to move them rocks
I used ta sell crack rocks
But now I'm an MC
I put the rhymes to beats
I used to move them rocks
I used ta sell crack rock
But now I'm an MC
I put the rhymes to beats

[Outro: Richie Rich]
I use to move them
I use to be a hustler man
You understand me
Sad shit
That a nigga had to do that
Where did ya put the scrilla
I used to sell rocks
You understand me
And then uh the rap thing kicked in
And now a mothafucka doin that
You don't quit one job till ya get anther
Belive that
I used ta sell crack rock
But now I'm an MC
I put my voice to beats
You understand me
I used ta slang crack rock
But now nigga
I put my rhymes to beats
I used ta slang them rocks
Real real dumb
Real real dumb
