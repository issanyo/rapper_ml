[Hook]
I'm just tryna get wasted
Have a couple shots here, have a couple shots there
I'm just tryna get wasted
Prefunk before the prefunk then kill a fifth at the function
I'm just tryna get wasted
Have a couple shots here, have a couple shots there
I'm just tryna get wasted
Prefunk before the prefunk then kill a fifth at the function
I'm just tryna get wasted

[Verse 1]
I'm just tryna get wasted, AMF, AMF, lets party like it's Vegas
Shotgun tall cans, 30 second keg stands, drinking til I can't stand, plus a nigga on a xan
Got this Molly bag thinking bout a dip to bring me back to life cause sipping all this liquor got me bent
David Hasselhoff, faded eating Wendy's, waking up to girls topless, wearin' only they bikinis
This the shit we live for, all the times you tell in story, bout the night PLUTOS turnt the party into an orgy
Women kissing women, coming out they clothes, experimenting intimacy, for the experience of Amber Heard
That's what the liquor do, mix in there a drug or two, and lose the judgmental self conscience other side of you
Peace of mind, free living, hyppie lifestyle, smoke some Ivory, come and kick it the new Jamall and Silas
Pat Reilly, nigga balling like the swoosh, see these Sperrys on my feet, I planning to get you wet
I'll drink to that, shot to that, chug to that, bounce that ass, bring the chorus back, where my alcoholics at?

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2]
Tore up, turnt then mud fucka, go nuts, if you ain't come to party why you show up
That sus, my niggas stay wildin til the club shut
Then we hit the after party to sniff drugs off tittus
O what, you mad, nigga shut the fuck up
Grab the fifth and chug that bitch until you start to throw up
I know macklemore said sober was fun but he never meet us
We get Mick Jagger fucked up, it make everything else betdah
That's on Molly, on Parton, on errthang, nigga getting stewy, straight giggin' like I'm Mac Dre
It don't matter if we in the Bay, in the K, Penn State, Cleveland State, we getting turnt errday
Stop babysitting, gone live it up, drink it up, get buck, girl we only live once
You can't tell me that you never got faded to the point, every single thing you did felt amazing
Running through the streets tripping on the pavement, sending drunk text to your ex saying that you hate em'
Looking for somebody to love just for the night, catch a cab, spend the night, next morning get outta sight
That's the life, when you live this shit right, game never thirsty, free throw line, Gatorade, Mike
Type of shit get cha granddad faded, sipping Jager, flipping tables, playing beer pong in his tighty whites
Why lie, bitch rollin where the OJ, couple shots of Jose and I'm back ready to go play
Redrum, I'm killin drinks like I'm OJ, I don't give a fuck if it's a 40oz or some Rose
