[Verse 1]
Get a whiff of this, Richie Rich got hit, unfortunately
But, yo, it wasn’t a ki
It was a half thang, and broke down, it was 500 grams, slick
Give or take a few zips
And it was cooked up, just like a bowl of clam chowder
‘Cause rocks roll better than powder, yo
And I was givin’ up so much love
‘Cause I was tired of the corner hustle, slangin’ dubs
I started off just rippin’
And I was taxin’ fools, keepin’ overkill zips in
I’m tryna get up on my feet
But now I’m fuckin’ off cash, puttin’ it right back in the street
I put deals on my buckets, to have somethin’ to ride
And if I had to bounce out, fuck it
‘Cause that’s just how the game goes
I’m living for the day I’m runnin’ drag to the lame hoes
Keep my beepers on silent
And a couple of gats in case fools tried to get violent
I was gettin’ my pop on
And when the summertime hit, I was in a flip drop, homes
I move shit like U-Haul
And I was fuckin’ enough, ‘cause every week I had the blue balls
I had bitches by the gang
But I never thought I’d get caught wit’ a half thang

[Chorus]
("I never got caught with a kilo")
Yo, naw, they caught me wit’ a half thang
("I never got caught with a kilo")
Yo, naw, they caught me wit’ a half thang
("I never got caught with a kilo")
Let me say it again, fool, they caught me wit’ a half thang

(Newscaster: Richie Rich was arraigned today on charges of transporting cocaine and possession of cocaine for sale)

[Verse 2]
Corner to corner and block to block
I was slangin’ that shit, gettin’ scratch like the chicken pox
And the itch is contagious
And nowadays you could find ‘em sellin’ dope in the Yellow Pages
I’ma put my sack up
‘Cause in a drought, I’d make a gat when the price goes back up
And it’s an Oakland thang
Niggas don’t gangbang, naw, but we damn sure slang
More dope than a fiend could smoke, no joke
Like Short said, even John the Pope
Couldn’t save this town from the shit it’s in
And hell yeah I got somethin’ for 10, fool
See, I was taught the rules by them niggas from the old school
I know a 6-figure bank don’t stank
All money ain’t good money, but if you lag, you lose
Then you end up payin’ more dues
Stay strapped and keep bustas out your mix
Be judged by 12, or carried by six
And don’t be afraid to shoot
‘Cause if you don’t pop him, that nigga’s finna pop you
And that’s basic Oakland game
But now it wasn’t enough, I got caught wit’ a  half thang

[Chorus]
("I never got caught with a kilo")
Yo, naw, they caught me wit’ a half thang
("I never got caught with a kilo")
Yo, unh uh, they caught me wit’ a half thang
("I never got caught with a kilo")
Ran up in my jones, man, they caught me wit’ a half thang

(Newscaster: Today, Rich was released after posting $80,000 bail.)

[Verse 3]
Game rules, and this is rule number three
You never keep a sack where you lay your head to go to sleep
And me, I vowed to quit, ‘cause I knew I had a rap career
A week later, the task hit
And it was covered on the news, and all through the papers
And them groupie ass bitches caught the vapors
When I was stuck in the justice
I wish Chuck D woulda told me you can’t trust it
Because my homies crossed the grain
They took a group I made and turned it to they own thang
I coulda went off the deep end
Grabbed the fully and a vest and put them fools to rest
But now back to the matter at hand
They got me in the system and I’m sweated by the man
He’s got my name and a PFN
And a four-way search allows him to come in
Search my house and vehicle
Sound shitty to you? Unh-uh. But to me, it do
Instead of using all the game I was given
I was slangin’ that dope just tryna make a livin’
But now thanks to them snitches in the game
Look, I got caught wit’ a half thang
