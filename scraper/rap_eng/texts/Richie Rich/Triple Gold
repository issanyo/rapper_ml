Don’t go chasing triple gold
Please stick to the hubcaps and the white walls you’re used to
I know that you’ve got action, that D, and you’re ready to roll
But I think you’re moving too fast

That’s right, it’s a dedication to my youngstas
You understand what I’m sayin’?
Young niggas out there ready to die, behind a set of rims
Whether it be Zeniths or Daytons
Triple golds on Vogues or triple golds on dubs
I know how it be
You could let that punk go
It’s big shit jumpin’ off, you understand what I’m sayin’?
That’s what be happenin’ in my city
Muthafuckas die behind them gold thangs

(“It’s 3500 for the straight laced triple gold with the Vogues…”)
