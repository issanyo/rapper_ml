[Chorus]
Smoking and drinking, wanna fade, they all kick in, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Ayo, thirsty ass niggas check this
Ain’t nothin’ like that 40 ounce to put you in the mix
Faded with a fat bomb sack from Fadingle
I’m loaded like than a muthafucka, Rich is finna mingle
Hangin’ out a brand new club full of cock on the jock
Can’t floss too tough ‘cause a nigga ain’t drunk enough
‘Cause when I’m loaded, my game gets to flowin’ like a river
And half of the shit that I deliver
Will be bogus, drag, but damn it sounds good
And bitches, they bite, ‘cause they done seen me in the neighborhood
In a Cutlass with some duals on it
Left hand danglin’ all up out the window with them jewels on it
And on the dancefloor, they callin’ me a hoe
I‘m finna bounce out and take my ass to the liquor store
That first 40 got me giving a fuck
But now 40 more’ll have a nigga way stuck
Then I can add to the drag that I peeped before I left
Like, “Baby, uh, my name is Jeff
I got a condo, a pool, and Jag with duals
I’m hooked with Thug Life, and we some muthafuckin’ fools”
Ooh, she bit, mission accomplished, I’m out
Straight to the room and we ain’t even got to talk about
The way that motel bed bounces
Getting loose off a whole 80 ounces (Oh yeah)

[Chorus]
Smoking and drinking, wanna fade, they all kick in, oh yeah
Smoking and drinking, wanna fade, they all kick in, oh yeah
Smoking and drinking, wanna fade, they all kick in, oh yeah
Smoking and drinking, wanna fade, they all kick in, oh yeah
Smoking and drinking, wanna fade, they all kick in, oh yeah
Smoking and drinking, wanna fade, they all kick in, oh yeah

Da-da-da, da-da-da…da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da, da, da-da-da

Smoking and drinking, wanna fade, they all kick in, oh yeah
Smoking and drinking, wanna fade, they all kick in, oh yeah
