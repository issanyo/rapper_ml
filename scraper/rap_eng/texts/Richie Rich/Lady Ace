Man: Ay, Loc, man, what’s up with your sister?
D-Loc: Man, what you mean "What’s up with my sister?" You better be talkin’ about that rap thang, potna
RR: The man said, "What’s up with your sister" She’s just rappin’, potna. That’s it
Man: What’s really goin’ on, though?
RR: She just rap. That’s what’s really goin’ on: straight rap. You know what I’m sayin’? She’s not for you
Man: Don’t trip
RR: She’s rappin'
D-Loc: Ay, peek this though; skip all the bull. Ay, let her come tight real quick, Rich, with this intermission thang, you know what I’m sayin'”?
RR: You think she can do it? All right. Come on, Lady Ace, let’s do this

[Lady Ace]
Yo, the Mistress of Ceremonies, comin’ through on the set and I suggest you request for the best
But if that ain’t it, you can get back and sit down
And set your mind on the most legit
Oh, I’m too much…you can’t handle me
And I’m treacherous, I’ll put you in misery
But if you wanna hear a definition, of me that says it all, A-W-E-S-O-M-E
The formula I use is called Ace-in’
It’s not wack, no, it’s straight amazin’
Comin’ to you and the price is right
I invite you tonight to set your eyes on the fight
But no, there will be none of that allowed
We got the mics, the beat, the rhyme, all we need is the crowd
To get pumped, which shouldn’t be hard to do
Just listen to the beats that I serve to you
It’s like a bit of icing gettin’ put on the cake that I bake
When you shake yo’ thang to celebrate
The moments that I bring to you so sincere, my dear
Here to cheer you on ear to ear
So devastating, I am the Ace in your face
Jammin’ hard, always, rockin’ the bass in the place
Suckaz, talkin’ all that mess
About what they have and about them being the best
Well, that’s bull and I’m the Lady Ace, so tell it
You thought you was better, but by now, it’s obvious that you’re weak, girl
You need to give it up
And if you write another rap, go ‘head and tear it up
Because, it ain’t about all that old school business
The new school’s comin’ up and I’m comin’ wit’ it
Your turn on the radio, you hear it here from me
You look on the charts, passing you is me you see
You said that you’re sick of hearing my name all around
Because you know I’m comin’ up and your name’s goin’ down
Now, I know what time it is, so you don’t seem to know
It’s obvious you’re feelin’ stupid so I think that you should go
