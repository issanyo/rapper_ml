Silent g, long hair, blaze like Marley
Niggas be thinking they boss, but they really employee
I ball on your ass in the finals, average 40, Jordan on Barkley
Don't buy they game, they lame, it's sampled, Stevie on Cosby
A touch of wonder, I'm gifted, lifted, you kids belong in car seat
You just a small town bitch tryna escape, Varsity Blues Darcy
I hate when you niggas be rapping I just drown ya voice out my head and listen to beat
I'm thinkin' I'm already going platinum if I grab every track for the cd from my nigga Via Streets
They told me the flow that I'm spitting, is like God talking to Moses, so I wrote the shit stoned
Pimps like us take over shit, PLUTOS, a bitch is a female dog they just wanna bone, they do
My niggas is here, I brought the whole crew, what you tryna get into?
Sex on the beach while it's raining, I promise some shit you ain't use to

I treat your main girl, like my coffee table, uh
We be rocking while you sleeping, please believe that we holding shit down
Clown bozos with the fam out the pound, by the gram, next thing I be snoozing on the ground
What's that sound, oh yeah, that's work, in the studio, no shoes, no shirt
Baby there's no problems, we just mobbing, maybe did it wrong but I coulda done worst
I'm just finding my stride, living my life by the day, can't give a fuck what you say
We just chopping the samples, then  rocking them beats and then knocking them boots into next week
Ain't nothing sweet in my game, you could do it too but it wouldn't be the same
We just posted in the rain, now soak it up, grab a red cup then fill that up
I'm leaning off green, no dirty sprite, see a pretty lady, aye, what that smell like
I'm just clowning out with my set, he could get you wet, I got you drowning
Surf that wave, I'm radical, gnarly, drink and smoke, I'm sober hardly
Hit your line like where's that party, get more play than iCarly

A insider, suga water
I got pornstar contenders and backside booty benders
Zumba, LA Fitness and Gold Gym members
Mrs. Parker, Mrs. Parker I need a training partner
And drive her like a Chevrolet, I need somewhere to park her
Drinking beers at 3:30 in the morning
Vamping, vaporizing, lame bitches boring
Gargoyles, spooge on hard boil
Gargamel snatching Smurf bitches on our soil

Name my bitches Carmex, they love to lip bomb me
I rock out, I'm laced in, you can't slip knot me
