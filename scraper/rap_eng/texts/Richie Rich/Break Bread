[Verse 1: Andre Nickatina]
Live fast, drive slow
I'm looking like Pac in the Benz when he was hanging out the window
Right now, I've got my Jesus piece on
And all my rings, you can see I'm about the game
Holler back, baby, like an echo
But you gotta know your colors
Get green, roll purple
My tires just did a full circle in your neighborhood
And like gumbo, the flavor's good
I roam like an alley cat, reggae Super Cat
Bumping Shabba Ranks on a full tank
My religion, baby, is big bank
Holler when you see me spending money, go amen
Snow bunnies love them a suntan
That's why I wear my hat low and my shades, man
I don't waste time or liquor
You can see it on my face, I don't chase, it's a race

[Chorus: Andre Nickatina]
Break bread
I don't know what they say where you stay
But where I stay, everybody say pay
So you'd better (break bread)
Baby it's a (go-go) when it comes to (cocoa)
Get down and do what you said (break bread)
Just like a leprechaun, looking for a jackpot
Or a hot crack spot, baby (break bread)
Baby it's a (go-go) when it comes to (cocoa)
Get down and do what you say (break bread)

[Verse 2: Andre Nickatina]
Man, this is money motivated, demonstrated it to the latest
I do it like an addict up in Vegas
And you can see me talking like a wizard through my cellular phone
I'm living life like a felony, weed and cologne, like
Pacific heights, crushed ice
I do it like a Hagler, baby, yeah, on a Sugar Ray Leonard night
Posted up just like a poster
If you're melting like butter, baby, I'ma have to toast ya
My stairway is straight Led Zeppelin
And my Air Force Ones so new and so fresh, and
Play you like a PS3
And that's Crown Royal, freak, dont try to BS me
But I never knew what she said
All up in her head with the phrase that pays, and it says:

[Chorus:  Andre Nickatina]
Break bread
I don't know what they say where you stay
But where I stay, everybody say pay
So you'd better (break bread)
Baby it's a (go-go) when it comes to (cocoa)
Get down and do what you said (break bread)
Just like a leprechaun, looking for a jackpot
Or a hot crack spot, baby (break bread)
Baby it's a (go-go) when it comes to (cocoa)
Get down and do what you say

[Verse 3: Richie Rich]
Twenty fifties, a hundred tens
Two white bitches in a Batman Benz (black Benz)
Straight mobbin', one named Robyn
Can't see her head cause the bitch probably bobbin, yo
Slurp somethin', twerk somethin'
Bitch, you gettin' money? Maybe we could work something
Been had a million
I don't need nathan but a bitch that love Vogues
And these all-gold Daytons
Hash Dre Dog, hash Nicky
You ain't getting money, you ain't fucking with Richie
Patron Silver, straight Goose
Twins with me, and they loose
Thirty rounds, town business
Don't make me break records like Guinness
Bitches wanna fuck all day and give head
But I don't fuck for free, ho
Nah, so

[Chorus:  Andre Nickatina]
Break bread
I don't know what they say where you stay
But where I stay, everybody say pay
So you'd better (break bread)
Baby it's a (go-go) when it comes to (cocoa)
Get down and do what you said (break bread)
Just like a leprechaun, looking for a jackpot
Or a hot crack spot, baby (break bread)
Baby it's a (go-go) when it comes to (cocoa)
Get down and do what you say
