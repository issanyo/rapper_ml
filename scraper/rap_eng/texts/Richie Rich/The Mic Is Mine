(As we go a little somethin’ like this)(x4)
(As we go a little somethin’ like this…hit it!)

[Verse 1]
See, the mic is mine, and I’m down to use it
And battle any pigeon that dares to abuse it
I’m a rhyme artist, so it belongs to me
I’m Richie Rich, Dubble-R, that down MC
I took a trip to New York disguised as a geek
Since they say they’re so hard I had to take a peek
I went to Queens, the Bronx, and even Brooklyn
Had the girls in a daze, and kept them all lookin’
Went to all of the parties, I left houses burnin’
From Jersey City to Bridgeport and Mount Vernon
And I just couldn’t see why they’re rated so high
Man, I’m an Oakland city gangster, a California guy
And the mic is mine
That’s right, it’s mine

[Verse 2]
Well, when I left Mount Vernon, what did I see?
A light brown beauty, she was fitted for me
So, I spoke to the girl as she stared in amazement
She said "Hi", but then she led me to the basement
But when she opened the door, oh man, gee
The walls were full of pictures, pictures of me
She said “Drop that disguise, I know who you are
You’re MC Richie Rich, the California rap star”
Her dress slid down, the body go round
The baddest old man in the town, he wouldn’t frown
And a body like hers, the woman had curves
But to mess with me, man, she had to have nerves
And now she’s mine
That’s right, mine

[Verse 3]
I moved on to Buffalo, and then Woodlawn Beach
Got on the mic, ‘cause I had a lesson to teach
To the New York suckaz who just won’t quit
Who think they’re oh so hard and so legit
I tell ya like this, children of New York
All the growlin’ and yellin’, it’s soft as pork
When it’s boiled in a pot of beans
And I prefer it over bacon like Sizzlean
I’m the California star, the best by far
I’m being given gold and dollars, and European cars
And when I see something I want, I simply say "Gimme"
And pretty soon there will be another rap in me
And it’ll be mine
That’s right, mine

[Verse 4]
So when I take things, like your gold or your freak
Don’t be upset, look, man, it’s kinda unique
You gotta peek it out this way, you met a rap star
He took your gold and your girl, and left you a car
You say you know that brotha from the Oakland town
Be a player, hang tough, hold your own and be down
‘Cause on the mic, I’m clownin’, punks I’m downin’
Don’t try to smile, your teeth are jacked, keep frownin’
The mic is mine
That’s right, mine

[Verse 5]
So I left New York en route to L.A
I said, what the hell, it’s a sunny day
I’m a microphone master and I’m in demand
I’d get a rent-a-car and head to Disneyland
Got off of my plane about 6 o’clock
The rent-a-car place was around the block
Grabbed my baggage and jogged to the door
A sign was posted that I never seen before
Printed clearly, it read like this, my friend
"We rent Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Benz’"
My eyes popped out, without a doubt
I had a briefcase full of money and too much clout
I was next in line and I could hardly wait
To get a Lamborghini, so I could devastate
So then she took my credit card and 200 in cash
Smoking a cigarette, she lightly dumped her ash
Then politely she whispered "Red, white or blue?"
I said, "Ah, nah, could this be true?
I’ll take the red one, ma’am, and I’ll also take the key
‘Cause I’m a rap star, I got places to be."
So I rushed out the door to the fresh red ‘ghini
Spotted a thick black girl in a bikini
I picked her up, and took her to the room to grind
And by the way, that Lamborghini is mine
That’s right, mine
The mic is mine
That’s right, mine
The mic is mine
I’m out
