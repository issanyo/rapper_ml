(Hey,hey,hey)
Am young and I want a Milly
Am rolling the dice and winning
Ain't scared of the rappers and I mean it
Rap in my blood I can feel it
Ain't scared of the beef I can kill it
Some niggas though I've been kidding
You pathetic boys have been playing
You hear me now and am trapping
Had a Rolex I'd be flexing
Dancing little bit am dabbing
No body can get on my way up
Am pushing am getting on my way up
Fucking bitches on my way up
Getting riches on my way up
OG's getting cold on my way up
Lil niggas fuck yah man up
