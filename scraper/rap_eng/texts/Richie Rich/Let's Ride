Something about the West coast...
Shhh... don't tell nobody

Something about the West coast
It makes me wanna ride
Shake it Westside
Throw ya hands up let's riide
To the city of the scene
Put it on the one get ya body on the dance floor
Something about the West coast
It makes me wanna ride [over last line]]
(Repeats until Verse 1)

[RR overlaps]
No disrespect it's all love and a muthafucka just feel real good
Be like what's poppin' on this side of the muthafuckin' planet
Understand me? It's still one love, smokin'
It's just a whole lot more money involved

[Verse 1]
In and out my zone
I roam like mobile phones (right)
Rag top 'Vettes Yukons & hundred chromes
Silly bitches lie in wait until the day I come home
While the phone machine kicks
"Biitch Rich ain't at home" (Ha)
Six million ways to mob choose one
I chose to dispose of those who call theyself foes
Froze like bitches, tuck they toes like hoes
These amateur niggas done turned pro
Can't ride with the hi pro glow
The boss with the sauce
Got receipts to show how much it cost
I dedicate this to the ridahs
Who like to slip sideways
Beware, double's shuttin down the highway

[Hook]
Shake it westsiide (something about the west coast) [over the line]
Throw ya hands up let's riide
To the city of the scene
Put it on the one get ya body on the dance floor
Something about the West coast
It makes me wanna ride [over last line]

[Verse 2]
How many MC's must get dissed
Before somebody say don't fuck with Rich
It's evidential, the presidential slap on the wrist
Who that new nigga from Oakland
With that brand new twist
Don't even worry 'bout it
Watch yo' neck & chest
They don't wanna get
Elliott like Mr. Ness
Known for flippin' scripts sick duets & mic' rips
But now I'm off the hook don't trip
Hookers throw yo' skirt up
Crookas' throw yo' turf up
Hustlers trust her & some of them put that work up
Cause if they ridin' they gone ride tonight
When they hit it we to the next light. Believe it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Thou commands me
To skyball hands free
Sam see I'm havin' some spam hezask me
Through yo' TV, had "5 On It" with The Luniz
[Yukmouth] I got five on it
You wanna ride with me
That's when you call yo' N-I-G
I'd rather be
Puttin' the twomp on somethin' thick
Big SSL with Nicki Scarf's within the mix
Still hittin' licks in the villo with cigarillos
Big head C-notes and them light green pillows
Tinted windows V dozen on my Benzo
The rumble and humble
Outdo' versus the indo'
That's how it be'z when I smoke for sho'
West Coast representin' all O. Believe it

[Hook] - repeat to end w/ ad libs
