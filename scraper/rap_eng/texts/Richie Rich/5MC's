(Yo, what’s up, Rich, man? The word on the street is that 5 MC's wanna get wit’ you on the showdown tip.)
(Man, is they gettin’ like that out there?)
RR: Man, if it ain’t one thang, it’s another. I’m just gonna kick it to ‘em with this element of surprise, you know what I’m sayin’?

[Verse 1: Richie Rich]
Instrumental flow, lyrical write-off
Brothas wanna peek the styles and try to bite off
The way that I rhyme, when I flow, I’m flowin’ slowly
But see the punks, they don’t know me
So they run up, most of ‘em strapped, I ain’t trippin’
I’m relaxed, I’m ‘bout to bust a cap
Baseball hat holdin’ sweat on my brow
I’m kinda nervous now ‘cause I don’t know how
Should I flow slow, fast, or maybe off-beat
On the knowledge tip, or should I kick it to the street?
Save it, I’ve got another suggestion
A freestyle from the mind’s collection
MC Number 1, he stepped up
I pressed up, so his rhyme was messed up
Spit a little rhyme about the way that I served it
Man, and the sucka deserved it
I wasn’t deep, solo, no crew
Then steps up, MC Number 2
He’s talkin’ about havin’ money for real
So I steal, and dished the man a raw deal
He couldn’t stomach it, he started coughin’ up blood
Two MC's to the mud
I try to tell these fools that Richie Rich ain’t playin’
While the music’s playin’, the tongue be slayin’
They didn’t hear me though, they kept slippin’
And MC Number 3, he better come in rippin’
I peeked his hoe card, he’s look like a biter
I ain’t sweatin’ that, ‘cause I’m a writer
And a freestyler, and man, I get wild
On a trick MC who wants to bite my style
See, there’s only one Richie Rich in the industry
And suckaz will soon learn to quit offendin’ me
Man, I ain’t takin’ it, I’m headed for one place
To get my money on in the cool rap race
See, Dubble-R, to me, he’s just a shadow
The one who appears when it’s time to battle
But Richie Rich, he’s bound to grow fa sho
So step on up, he’s MC Number 4
When the man approached, he struck for the neck
But the rhyme was weak, so the boy was checked
Like a lawn mower with a high-speed blade
I got wit’ him, first with a high-top fade
And then the chest section, ‘cause he was lackin’ a vest
He fell to the floor, that’s when he confessed
That’s four MC's, man, I’m no joke
I surprised Number 5 with a dose of the Loc

[Verse 2: D-Loc]
Wait, hold it, buddy, it ain’t over wit’ yet
Number 5, step up, the last contestant
You can’t get away with dissin’ my man, Rich
You know why? ‘Cause D-Loc is on top of it
Now I’mma flow like wind when it blows
And it ya like a hurricane, swing ya like a tornado
When the whirlpool ends, once again, Richie Rich holds the title, rated champion
The mistake you made was to play the game played by big macks
Rulers of the 24-tracks
I got news, silly: you better get wise, ‘cause you’re dealin’ with the element of surprise
