Got my mind on my money, money on my mind, while I'm blowing on this pine
200 hunnet on the dash, got a bitch in the passg, and you know she got ass
This the life that we choose, not the life that chose us, so don't blame it on luck
Fuck yo 9-5, I grind 9-5, studio 5-9, so I guess you could say that I work

[Bridge: Via Streets]
Work, Work, Work, Work, Work, All We Do is Work
Work, Work, All We, All We, All We
Work, Work, Work, Work, Work, All We Do is Work
Work, Work, All, All, All, All, All, All

[Verse 1: Rardy]
Steady stacking these Benjamin's, they say they balling that's just pretend
Filet mignon, so you could save the salt, I like to taste the flavor not that seasoning
I just ate and I'm still hungry, yo girl calling I just keep ignoring
Xerox niggas just copy style, so I changed the file and let em keep the torrent
I'm good, dollars all in the mental
On the route to get this money with my kinfolk
It's 1500 for the minimum if you want the show, stop playing
I need all my funds, I don't want the bitch unless she celibate, nuns
I'm just a crazy ass nigga, Klaus Kinski, Mel Gibson
Sipping on that purple sprite, got her loose drawls, Metamucil
Snatched a hunnet thousand views, niggas thought I rigged YouTube
When I drop this all my niggas on them blogs like, "right on, fucking right, he's back dude"
That's right I'm that dude, some niggas love to hate
Cause they bitch feel me, that's masturbate
I am the great, don't fabricate, just detonate, explode
While I'm ridin' round my side of town with a bad bitch belong in Vogue, nigga

[Verse 2: Via Streets]
I call her Mary and she like Kesha
I like em both so lets get married and call a feature
Let's do a song, Let's make a movie you can tell the story
Just play your role I call that pimpin' you can sell it for me
These hoes they bore me, catch me soaring, oh yeah I'm flying
Ok I'm lying but I'm high, on auto-pilot
My 9-5 is jugging, grinding, catch me chopping game
These fakes and lames don't understand, I'm on top of thangs
My pocket change go on Jordan's catch me copping kicks
I'm pouring up, my nigga Raw, had two pints of it, now I'm the shit
That come from hogs ass, I often haul ass, way clear like hall pass
I'm off that, your girl she's off that, and now she's on it
Catch me digging in the pussy, ho I'm reaching the gold
Like bitch can't cross the street unless she's paying a toll
Bro, I don't know, but she knows me, this bitch is nosey
But she pays me when she owes me, forreal
