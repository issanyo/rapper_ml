(Intro)
They did you wrong my nigga
You know what I mean
Miss you like a muthafucka
Shit is cold
Fuck 'em

(Chorus)
They did you wrong - you still my nigga
But love is long - you gon' be my nigga
And I'm tellin you now - boy, I miss you nigga
And I'm holdin it down - until I'm with you nigga
They did you bad - you still my nigga
But I ain't mad - we gon' get dem niggas
And I'm tellin you now - boy, I miss you nigga
And I'm holdin it down - until I'm with you nigga

(Verse 1)
We started on bikes, ended up on Harley D's
Balled thru the summer, caught a case for the half-of G's
Nuthin was between us, we knocked niggas out
Served rocks in the drought befo' the po's catch route
Then you died on me and my whole shit changed
Took a whole different outlook on niggas in this game
Cause the enemy didn't get killed, the homeboy did
And we from the same hood, and that's some weak-ass shit
What the fuck
Now I got to smoke my nigga
Get the strap, pointed all way and smoke my nigga
How we finna go to war when we killin each other
Sayin "Hi" to your mother then pull a strap on your brother
You niggas is twisted
Maybe I should point and blast
Give a fuck about your family
Just point and blast
Shoot body my nigga, now I must return the favour
*BUCK* *BUCK* - I guess it's a hood behaviour

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
It took us a year to find that boy that hit ya
Did him bad, now I know that nigga is somewhere with ya
But I ain't mad, when I die we gon' hook up then
My nigga hollered like "Ooh" and wooped his ass again
It don't stop, baby boy, you ain't missin nuthin
But some weed and some liquor, niggas out here frontin
Hella fakes, same bitches on that nuthin shit
I'm stayin true, keepin faulty niggas out of my mix
But missin you, it ain't the same when I'm in the cutty
I blow a blunt but I can't pass it to my buddy
I seen your sonny, hella big, eatin barbeque
He talkin shit, tryna rap, think he hard as you
But that lil' nigga, but lil' do that nigga know
The footsteps he have to follow when that nigga grown
I seen his momma doin good, she tryna keep it trill
Until we crossroad my nigga, I'mma keep it real
You still my nigga
You gon be nigga
Boy I miss you nigga
Until I'm with you nigga

(Chorus)
