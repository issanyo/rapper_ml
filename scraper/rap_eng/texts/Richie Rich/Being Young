[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Mr. HBO
Lets go
Look who you know spend money like he hate it
Show up to your house, fifth of Goose, tryna get you faded
Random facts out his ass, with a baggy full of grass
Talking shit about Mayweather, saying he prolly whip his ass?
Rardy, that's just who I be
You know I won't change like LeBron to the heat
Keep going for my team baby shout out to the Geeks
We be them eastside players that you dying to meet
Look, everyday I wake up, money gotta cake up
Need a new whip, new house, need a Jacob
Shooting for the stars, knock it down like a face up
Kidnap the judge, hold him hostage til' the case up
Life is such a shake up, that's why I keep my Ace up
Living on the wild side cause sticking to the basics
Ball til' I fall like a fetus in a bitch gut
Bitch you looking at the one, I'm feeling Neo in the matrix
Rim rock ya shit, Shaq on the pass from Kobe
How the fuck I'm not next, I was trained by Obi-Kenobi
Your girl is on my Slater, I let her ride me like Yoshi
Saved By The Bell, chillin' Bayside with Kelly Kapowski
You know me, same dude mostly
Grew my hair out, no longer rocking the goatee
Rocked a few shows my favorite had to be Berkley
In the bay they get it crackin' like summertime in the OC
Should I proceed with my head up like a nose bleed
Laughing at the haters who said the Northwest was so weak
Now you get a Rain City rep, better use caution
Rardy be flossin', Macklemore world tour froshmen
Shit gets official when it comes to the town
Man you was who you was fo' you got here clown
Only god ca' judge me, so I'm gone
Either love me or leave me alone, na sing my damn song

[Hook]
