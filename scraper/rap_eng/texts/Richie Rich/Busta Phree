[Verse 1]
Did a little bit of jail time, now I’m back in the house
And I’m jonesin’, and you know what I’m thinking about
Sex, and in the studio getting mine
Ain’t dropped a tape since, uh, ‘89
I was crossed up by some brothers that be jackin’
So if you bought that tape and felt that it was lackin’
Here’s that missing link, and my apologies extended
That shit jumped off but that ain’t how it was intended
But yo, peep it, I’m the creator of that old shit
You know it fa sho, that’s why my old shit hit
And now I’m to the head, I’ma let you fools see
What Double R can do solo, ‘cause I’m busta phree

[Chorus]
Busta free…in the night
Straight solo, he’s solo
He’s busta phree…in the day
Straight solo, straight solo

[Verse 2]
But now that jailhouse is full of brothas that be bustin’
But I can’t bite, I’m not that nigga to be trustin’
The drag and the drama about the things they be havin’
See them fools on the street, and I be laughin’
‘Cause they tore back—oh, where your Cadillac at?
Oh now it’s in the shop—fool, you sniffin’ hop
And getting dime thangs—trick, them screens ain’t even clean
That’s a damn shame—all that time, he was a fiend
But look, that ain’t that the half—I heard ‘em worse than that
They got brothas in jail with a hundred G’s stacked
That ain’t impossible, I’ve seen brothas that raw
But now when commissary come, this nigga don’t even draw
He jocks my sack—“Yo Rich, shoot some soup”
Hey, what’s the scoop? I thought you had a hundred G’s, troop?
Get off my dizick, support your own damn habits
Get dry draggin’, and acting like you living lavish
You’s a struggler, straight broke, that’s no joke
Using heroin, speed, crank, and probably white dope
Telling lies ‘cause you was bunkin’ with me
I couldn’t wait ‘til my release date to be busta phree

[Chorus]
Busta free…in the night
Straight solo, he’s solo
He’s busta phree…in the day
Straight solo, straight solo, yeah

[Verse 3]
Now you can bounce, rock, skate, and roll
But don’t side bust, ‘cause brotha, I trust
That you could peep the game in the script I spit
And ain’t no shame in my game, I kick that saucy shit
Now I can’t run my caper, spend a boatload of paper
Without one of these old marks catchin’ the vapors
They wantin’ to hang out and fight for me at my shows
Dog the blunts, and showstop on the hoes
I’m getting sick of this busta shit
I’m ‘bout to blast out, stab out, mash out
And try my best to get further
Before these cats in the Town make the Double catch a murder
And on the stand when I enter my plea
I’m straight guilty, one time, but now I’m busta phree
Believe that

[Chorus]
Free…free, yeah
Straight solo, he’s solo
Free…free, yeah
Straight solo, straight solo, yeah

[Outro]
Oh, the funk is on, it’s on its way (It’s on its way)
Ballin’ every night and every day (Every day, yeah)
Oh, the funk is on, it’s on its way (On its way)
Ballin’ every night and every day (And every day, yeah, hey)

Ballin’ every night and every, every day
Ballin’ every night and every day, yeah
