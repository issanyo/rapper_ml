Verse 1 *(Rame Royal)*

Whoever said love was stronger than pride
Lied
Whoever said they never did wrong to Highside
Be quiet
Feel me if you done been in some riots
An came up on somethin for nothin
Fuck havin to buy it
When there's so many ways to make it happen
It juss so happen I chose rappin to keep me from gettin crackin
Wit unorthadox plots
I gots to clock out
Every beat I got is a knocker
Never show stoppin for parties
We controlin fates
Self-employed Royal
From Golden State
Gettin high as real estate rates
An black hawk
An can't wait to peel a cap off
Intoxicants
An compliment
We out to get her out abstanince
Eatin phat at restaurants
An juss
Tryin to get up to that upper enchalaunt status
You think that
I'm sellin somethin in tree wrap
But I juss eat, drink, an think rap on the nack

*(Chorus)* x2

Verse 2 *(Rame Royal)*

Rame open for business, 25-8
A nigga tryin to motivate in this game wit high stakes
Accumulate figures
To calculate
Generate income
An then some
To win funds to appreciate
Energize my enterprize
Recognize
Minimize
Time to hibernate
Dedicate mine
To a real grind and rhyme
Excelerate while I'm climbin
Why wait?
An let snakes dictate my fate
In control pimp my whole program
Check mics like hoes in Cadilac brohams
Matter fact
Maximimum sacks
Act like they got cateracts
Now no man see's Royal for less than 4 grams
What I've seen is savage
Now my eyes love to visualize above average
Luxurious
Lavish shit
These big leaugers an myself
Said fuck fatigues
To get established with wealth
An live extravagent

Chorus x2 *(Richie Rich, Rhythm & Green)*

Rhythm & Green on deck
To check the mizzy
(Phone Check mayne!)
It's off the hook
Mornin
Noon
An nizzy
Stay busy
(Stay busy)
Make it happen Rame an Jul
(We gonna do our thang, like the thang to do)

Rhythm & Green on deck!
