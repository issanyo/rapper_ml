[ INTRO: Richie Rich ]
Hahahaha...
Parents good and gone, just left town
But what they don't know
Is the whole time they was plannin on leavin
I was plannin on stayin

[ Chorus (+ Richie Rich) ]
We came to move ya
(Finna put together one of them old schools)
Just like we told ya
(nice house parties, you know)
To the early mornin
(for all my partners and a couple of nice women)
You can't control it
(It's gon' be outta control)
We came to move ya
(I been doin this)
Just like we told ya
(Just me and my fellas)
To the early mornin
(we always hittin it proper)
You can't control it

[ VERSE 1: Richie Rich ]
Late night, my homies, we creepin and hangin
Ain't lookin for no trouble, ain't got no time for slingin
A whole bunch of women on my beeper, let's ring em
Tell em that it's on, if they got homies, bring em
Top notch, baby, only nines and dimes
If you can hook up yours, then I can hook up mine
But bring your own bottle cause the bar's finna be closed
And we chargin $5 at the do'
Look and eh - if you didn't plan on comin through here solo
Don't bring out all your homies, cause punk, that's a no-no
See, all we need is women to make this party pop
Do you know how we do it on the block?
You got to charge ballers ten but let them women in
And get em drunk all night off of that cheap gin
So when it's on it's on, but if it ain't it ain't
But when it ain't, keep yo ass out the paint
Girl, cause if I see you lookin nice I'ma push up quick
And let you know, zip your pants, cut that dance, let's go
I got this chronic, plus I got a blunt we can blow
Before I let the soul pour, we get out of control

[ Chorus (+ Richie Rich ]
We came to move ya
(To the break of dawn)
Just like we told ya
(Tic-toc, all around the clock)
To the early mornin
You can't control it
(Because it's out of control)
We came to move ya
(That's right)
Just like we told ya
(Break it down, break it down)
To the early mornin
(Uh)
You can't control it
(Because it's out of control)

[ VERSE 2: Richie Rich ]
Let's swing it to the back cause my neighbors be woofin
Don't like that out in front, cause they sho' do be lookin
The party's on the inside, that's where you wanna be
You leave with what you brought plus some top notch puss...
But if you don't, then you were slippin, money grip
You missed em on the front but you can catch em on the flip
Because they loaded, they gone, they lit and stuck
And if you comin at em right, boy, I know you comin up
See, it's a catch to that, cause see, I do this every month
If my parents is gone, boy you know it's finna jump
It's me, the D-u-double b-l, just me, Tommy and Denny
We shootin that shit good and plenty
And it was so many groupies, youngsters, stunts and blunts
They givin up the real, ain't no future in that frontin
Damn baby, now how you gon' act?
Fleshtone fits with all that back
But wait, check it, at first a fella thought you was naked
But then I doubled back and man, I had to accept it
I knew a woman like you and she was in love
With the D-u-dubb, haha, and it was outta control

[ Chorus (+ Richie Rich) ]
We came to move ya
(That's right)
Just like we told ya
(Haha)
To the early mornin
You can't control it
(Because it's out of control)
We came to move ya
(Tic-toc, around the clock)
Just like we told ya
(Once again it's on)
To the early mornin
You can't control it
(That's cause it's out of control)
We came to move ya
Just like we told ya
(24, 24)
To the early mornin
You can't control it
(Nah, that's cause it's out of control)
We came to move ya
(On and on and)
Just like we told ya
(Early mornin)
To the early mornin
(To the break of dawn)
You can't control it
(Nah, because it's out of control)

( *break* )

[ Richie Rich ]
To the break of dawn
Haha
Once again
Boy, it's out of control
Riiight
Haha
This is out of control

[ Chorus (+ Richie Rich) ]
We came to move ya
Just like we told ya
(Got to clean this up before my folks get back to the house)
To the early mornin
(But until they do arrive)
You can't control it
(We'll be out of control)
We came to move ya
(That's right)
Just like we told ya
(Haha)
To the early mornin
(To the early mornin)
You can't control it
(Ah-ah, because it's out of control)
We came to move ya
(Swing yo thing, baby)
Just like we told ya
(Do it how you wanna do it)
To the early mornin
You can't control it
(That's cause it's out of control)
We came to move ya
(Out of control)
Just like we told ya
(Way too many problems for ya sometimes)
To the early mornin
You can't control it
(That's cause it's out of control)
We came to move ya
(It's out of control)
Just like we told ya
To the early mornin
