Intro: Richie Rich, (DeWayne Wiggins)

(Take a hit of this joint, take a puff of the bulkest dove)
Puff on it!
9-6 (baby) Richie Rich, Rame Royal, hmm

Verse 1: Richie Rich

When I wake up in the morning, first I yoke out
Then I ???? pimp, so I can smoke out
Good green opening up my third eye for sure
As I contemplate on which spot I'd like to go today
Damn, should I CDB again, I feel like loccin
Fallin thru every bomb spot in Oakland
I got the good but I just can't trip
Skyball TWAMP TWAMP for a piece of crip
Danl ???? that's the place to go
And my partner on the corner got the sack for sure
'84, I'm quick to look for booty hook
And if I'm fienin I need to see beamin
Cos, aah, them young brothers smoke the same way I smoke
But now all day I'm comin up short
Uh, I hope the town still love me
For some reason and my deceasing and my zoot's ain't fluffy
I need a pillow

Chorus: DeWayne Wiggins

Lay a drop on the pillow (Yeah baby)
And just relax, relax, relax (Cos that was made for you)
Lay a drop on the pillow (yeah baby)
I'll fly free sack (fly free sack), fly free sack
(Cos that was dove for you)

Verse 2: Rame Royal

By chance it might seem strange, many nights I dream
Of trees on the range with branches of light green
Women slumbering get tossed like salad with cucumber
But can't stop me from gettin lost on the lands of broccoli
High! I shut em, close my eyes, cough, too much spirit goes
The cloud nine where I'm a lyrical wiz
Magical like Willow wit automatic flowin pillows
Get rolled in a bliz and consumed, that's how Rame Royal is
In my room at the villo, sun shines thru blue blinds
On the window, lettin me know it's time
To go back to reality
Oakland, Cali
And a sack of indo left on the bed
Next to my rizzy's head
Fulfillin wishes, I'm fillin phillies, Vegas and swishes
Wit twenty reefers, sticky weed - minty and delicious
All I need and can axe for, a twamp to crunch
Probably won't want another blunt til lunch

Chorus

Verse 3: Richie Rich

Fell thru Sophia's but didn't see her
Now I'm convinced that it's on when I fall thru this red fence
I shoulda flipped the whole thang when I had the chance
But that done broke my back like a bald bozack
On a late night, I lurk for sure and got a lot of dough
For the first cat with the platinum sacks
And, naw, it ain't a jack, you can hold my scraps
But pull a move and catch a lump to the back behind the scak
Richie Rich might walk a country mile, smilin all the way long
Wit dreams of pullin bongs, writin bomb songs
Buzzin with my cousin at the villo
Stressin off a pillow

Chorus: DeWayne Wiggins

Lay a drop on the pillow (yeah baby)
And just relax, (just) relax, relax
(I know, I know, I know the sack was one for you!)
Lay a drop on the pillow (yeah baby)
I'll fly free sack, (fly free sack), fly free sack
(I know this sack was wrong for you)

Yeah ba-by!
Oooh yeah
Here we are gettin night endeavour
Don't worry cos it's gonna get better
I roll a fat one for you, yeah
Break it down cos it ain't no startin
Put a drop on the every bodin
And I'll blow a pillow with you
