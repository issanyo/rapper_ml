(Yuk)
Dun dun dun dun dun duh

(Chorus-Rich)
The only way that I can bring it to ya is to school ya
Lesson by lesson, (so many questions)
The only way that I can bring it to ya is to school ya
Lesson by lesson, (so many questions)
The only way that I can bring it to ya is to school ya
Lesson by lesson, (so many questions)
The only way that I can bring it to ya is to school ya
Lesson by lesson, (so many questions)

(Rich)
Way hate me, or should I say hate on me
Why do brothers bump they gums and debate on me
Why when I ride by and don't stop
You feel I disrespected your block

(Knumskull)
If you had a top-notch lezbo, straight from Peanuts
Sexin, tell me would you hit it without protection, uh uh
Let's make it harder, what if she had a friend
Both down for nut huggin, off the Hen, would you spend

(Yukmouth)
Chips, what if I come off the ho with six-six
Will I get back in the mix, drop some grip, or just quit
What if O.J. verdict was different thing
Would we swing, start lootin and shootin with Rodney King

(Rich)
If it was a fifth, would you share it with ya folks
So we could ride out and get smoked
I wonder if I dropped a hundred dollars would you give it back (no)
I wonder if we cool like that (hell no)

(Chorus)

(Knumskull)
You got three cute flees, one fine, one got a job, one with patience
What would you dick for a long term relation
Money is the thing, fine ones can start hatin
I'm broke so I need one with patience

(Yukmouth)
If I was hella dirty, look like Mr. Furley
With lint up in my curly hair
Would you groupie-ass girlies stare
What if I didn't have a car to skee-skirt in
Would you still be flirtin or would it be curtains

(Rich)
If you got your teeth knocked out, would you refreak the old ones
Or rush to the dentist for some gold ones
If you had forty dollars, and a hooker wanted thirty
Could we catch you out in Vegas doin dirty

(Knumskull)
If you got one gritty and five niggas
Would you speak on the choo-choo shit to make the situation bigger
She'll do it, but now she on some new shit
You gotta go down town, enjoy the fluid

(Chorus)

(Yukmouth)
How many blunts must I take to the face to be straight, forty
If I don't got five on the eighth would you fake or, smoke it
Get loaded or hold it like a buster to get cluster
Should I be rollin with big hustlers

(Knumskull)
Would I take one and a heisteses
Wanna bubble, but you can't keep up with the priceses

(Rich)
And then I ask you, what if I sold a million plus
Should I renegotiate with that nigga Russ

(Chorus)
