Tay Dizm

(Chorus - Tay Dizm)
What other click gonna have the club on smash
Got every chick in here shaken' they ass
Buy out the whole bar in the V.I.P
Like who wanna come all drinks on me

If ya bout it make you know it, throw it up
Who got that pressure, that pressure
We walkin' out with the baddest in the club
And nothing lesser, lesser

(Verse One - Ridah Redd)
We up in V.I.P got bottles all over the table
Everybody wants a taste of this but they ain't able
So many honeys up in here I don't know who to choose
I know I want the fattest ass damn it thats the truth
I'm fresh as fuck everything I'm wearing is brand new
Take a look at how many bottles we done ran through
The DJ playing all the cuts and got everybody bouncin'
Its our year baby see all this money we counting
>From Palm Beach County to Opa-locka and Tallahassee
The thugs show me love and all the ladies they get nasty
You should of watched the news and see how bad we make it rain
Making other niggas jealous knowing they can't do the same
Ain't no shame up in my game got every right to stunt
Lil mama hang around me like she want that pipe or something
But I ain't mad at her, shit she fine its cool
I'm walking out with the baddest bitch up in this room

(Chorus - Tay Dizm)
What other click gonna have the club on smash
Got every chick in here shaken' they ass
Buy out the whole bar in the V.I.P
Like who wanna come all drinks on me

If ya bout it make you know it, throw it up
Who got that pressure, that pressure
We walkin' out with the baddest in the club
And nothing lesser, lesser

(Verse Two - Brisco)
Valet my car for me and send my bottles up
I got my dogs with me and all we do is stunt
Roll a blunt but keep it down though
Lil mama buckwild she bring it down low
A couple singles on me I take em out an thaw
I rock a lot of ice I know you see the snow
V.I.P life call me black patron
A lil Ciroc and take a bitch home
Thats Ridah Redd, thats Brisco
We lookin' out for feds
We tryin' to get the dough
Motivation money, pretty girls and homes
The Louis shoes comfy but the walk long
Strip clubs, tip drill, my pressure on me
A hater better chill, Young Money before the deal
Dumb hungry, and still keep it real

(Chorus - Tay Dizm)
What other click gonna have the club on smash
Got every chick in here shaken' they ass
Buy out the whole bar in the V.I.P
Like who wanna come all drinks on me

If ya bout it make you know it, throw it up
Who got that pressure, that pressure
We walkin' out with the baddest in the club
And nothing lesser, lesser
