When no ones lookin
When no ones there
Thats when your dirt gets done round here
When no ones lookin
When no ones there
Thats when your dirt is gettin done round here
When no ones lookin
When no ones there
Thats when your dirt gets done round here
When no ones lookin
When no ones there
Thats when your dirt is gettin done round here

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
I wake up in a world which
Used to be full of merchants
Watchin my every move
I couldn't find my purpose
I remember walkin around
Feelin the eyes on my back
Tryin to keep up the act
But it fell through
Down down the well it goes
And all this hell i know
Is now publicly owned
Oh now now this clever poem
Can be your very own
Little melody go
Sing with me
Blindfold the neighborhood
Close the window say its good
Burn the forest claim the wood
Ill do it and say you should
Break every lightbulb and battery
Cuz i dont need these purists
And pot junkies mad at me
Call it censorshipment
I call it reality
Smoke and mirrors get bent
Circus like analogy
Give them slithers ten cents
And theyll take all your salary
I keep my dirt covert
So i can sprout an apple tree and

[Verse 2: Tay Dizm]
Swarmin like bumblebees
We serve the economy
Big dogs world
And it keeps swervin right in front of me
But i got hella focus tho
Cuz im floatin with honeybees
We totin that honeycomb
We headed to overseas
They say they got it
I want it
So what they hittin for
They got it
Lets go and get it
Bring it to the door
I got that
They drop back
We fight back
You like that
See we are off the chain
We been doin this for long
Its my thing go to Jamaica
Grab my stash and bring it home
In the mall you hate me
It ain't my fault i made it
I got my money right
I got my money up
I done went and bought myself a bentley and a ? brah
Bitches in string bikinis when you see me
And not an episode is ending so you can turn the tv

[Verse 3: Bernz]
Walkin the other side
Walkin the thinnest line
Within the shadows where the killers hide
She never pictured him the crazy type
They never picked up on the signs
Until they tallied up the crime
Watch for the quiet ones
Where you decide to run
Watch for the fire
Then before you decide givin up
Stick em up stick em up
Trap is hottest as we set up shop
And now these informants are bein planted like illegal crops
Yea inside these primary colors
I find a shade of blue to smuggle
And some worse for my brothers
Im axle foley homie
Now you dont know me
Im undercover
Plannin and plottin
Under this concrete and gutters
Playin these numbers
And runnin with killers
It be free all that i can see
Takin all thats in front of me
They had it comin
Tired of hunger so we did somthin
Had to steal some money
Power, respect and their lovin
