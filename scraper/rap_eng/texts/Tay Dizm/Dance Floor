[Intro]
{*piano and instrumental for 0:24*}
Hoooo-hoooooooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh!

[T-Pain]
I got the hat, I got the shoes, I got the outfit
I go outside and pick the ride I'm gon' go out with
But right befo' I hit the streets
I gotta put on my dancin shoes in the mirror

[Interlude]
And now, rock with it rock with it
And now, step with it step with it
Who want it now, slide with it slide with it
And now, ride with it ride with it
And now, walk with it walk with it
And now, get low!!
And now, and I know where I'm 'bout to go

[Hook 2X: T-Pain]
I'll be on the dance floor - don't be janky with me
Shawty was in the corner now she's lookin for me
I'll be on the dance floor - that's what I do
In a minute I'll be in it and I'm jukin with you

[T-Pain] On the dance floor

[T-Pain]
Oh I hit the club and I'm ready for a dance off (a dance off)
Me and Dizm 'bout to blow a nigga pants off (his pants off)
So if he wanna ride with me
I'm 'bout to do the same thing that I did in the mirror

[Interlude] + [Hook]

[Tay Dizm]
Ay this is yo' boy Tay Dizm, y'knahmsayin?
Hakuna matata y'know?
Ay, I'm doin this here for the South y'knahmsayin?
With my nigga Pain

I done told y'all niggas befo' we dropped hits
Cause anything we touch it known to be the shit
Like an old school body that's gutted all out
From the grill to the paint to the dump in the back
It's a jump off, and the Dizm gon' get it off
Hit the club, get you thinkin it's a Mardi Gras
And who stepped to my crew?
Then this is what my crew gon' do my nigguh~!
