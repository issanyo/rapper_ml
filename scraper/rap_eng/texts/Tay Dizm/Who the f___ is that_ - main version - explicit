I hit the club with a mug so mean
Got them niggas like who the fuck is that?
Then I hopped up out the car so clean
Got them hoes like who the fuck is that?
Hit the door like right left, back forth
Yeah I got the money, nigga thats of course
Hit the stage with a b-boy stance
The club owner like who the fuck is that?
Pull up in somethin tinted, two hundred on the dash
Yall shit rented, hot drop cash, watch the doors lift up
This nigga then went mad, I'm what you never had
Some of this, and some of that
Tell that bitch to give me a kiss, then I smack her on the ass
Throw a stack at her and laugh
This shit to me ain't nothing
How much money do you have?
Thats not up for discussion
Ill be mashing out in something European on them buttons
I been rich since I was eleven
My grams look like sevens
My killers look like reverends
And you better count your blessings
Konvict piece around my neck
Misdemeanor on my wrist
Got a felon on my pinkie
Got you blinkin when it gliss
I got strippers on the payroll
Chargers in Diego
Yayo like its mayo
Don't play around me pesos
You should see this steelow
Neighborhood nino
Bitches call me Dolla
But these niggas call me Debo
I hit the club with a mug so mean
Got them niggas like who the fuck is that?
Then I hopped up out the car so clean
Got them hoes like who the fuck is that?
Hit the door like right left, back forth
Yeah I got the money, nigga thats of course
Hit the stage with a b-boy stance
The club owner like who the fuck is that?
Shinin like a motherfucker
BBS is blankin'
Steve Erkle bought a ton
That purple stay stinkin'
You talk to that nigga, I got swag, I got juice
See me in that Bentley Coup
Right in front of runnin shoop
You be runnin when I shoot
I be shootin when you runnin'
Con got me out the streets
Told me Dolla get that money
Now Im the club stuntin like la la la la
Laughin at these clown niggas like ha ha ha ha
Look, you fuckin with a winner
Strippin lobster for the dinner
Veteran in the game
You wasn't niggas, just beginners
And my d boy stance bout to pop a rubber band
Fuck that fightin in the club
You niggas fuckin up my plans
Im tryna get a dance, her name and her number
Take her to the teli and get some brain in the hummer
You niggas make it rain while Dolla make it thunda
Album comin soon, bitch, get ready for the summer
I hit the club with a mug so mean
Got them niggas like who the fuck is that?
Then I hopped up out the car so clean
Got them hoes like who the fuck is that?
I'm like right left, back forth
Yeah I got the money, nigga thats of course
Hit the stage with a b-boy stance
The club owner like ooo wee
Ain't nothin' for me to come through and shut the club down
Walk through the club me and mug haters down
Drop a stack at the bar, a hundred Louis thirteen
Posted up camouflage down to my feet, feet
They lookin' at me like, who is, who is he?
I straighten up yo boy, he raised in the streets
My name's Ramone and you can spell it when I step in yo room
Take VI, Chevy go zoom
I hit the club with a mug so mean
Got them niggas like who the fuck is that?
Then I hopped up out the car so clean
Got them hoes like who the fuck is that?
I'm like right left back forth
Yeah I got the money, nigga thats of course
Hit the stage with a b-boy stance
The club owner like who the fuck is that?
