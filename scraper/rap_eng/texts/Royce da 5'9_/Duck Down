[Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, haha, yeah
Yeah, I'm on ya phone, ya friends and killers
You Capone 'til I comb the village from home to California
Runnin up on ya Dozen, you cornered
You bust and be gone, I send ya mother a dozen begonias
I make ya boss WISH that he had
Somethin that's more vicious and I'm killin anything that he HAD
Past you, I ain't only lyrically killin you BAD
I'm killin you wit a passion and then I'm sealin your casket SHUT!
Too many problems followin me sayin
That I am the +King+, I am a +dream+, I helps my game
Not to offend or hurt the work you put it
My street niggas feel it, it's self-proclamied
So, who wanna creep?  What weakling wanna beef?
+Ben Franklin+ run the streets, he came in a +hundred+ DEEP!
You niggas can keep ya thirty murkers
I offer 'em all extra money man them niggas is workers
Where was them niggas when you had dreads, you liar
You Mekhi Phifer, lay on your side like a hyphen
Nigga I ain't built for who bitch, what now?
Tell 'em niggas when I see 'em it's on, they better DUCK (down)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
A truce is impossible, fuck you
It's over, you was responsible for the drunk you
You punk you, when I see you you better DUCK (down)
BUM!!  Wanted them guns to go boom, boom, boom

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, the problem's that all of you did
Somethin that you can't take back, you all know what it is
Compete on wax is what we coulda did
But you think that ya man is so hard just cause he don't rap
What is the street nigga relatin to combat
If he-a put you in the grave then maybe I'm that
Type of nigga like you, I call you a cheapskate
Cause you cheap and when it's beef in the streets you skate
Nigga you can't deny the force
35 hundred in the streets, all just so you can die on my porch
Punk!  I will bust my gun 'til the round is finished
You gon' kill who I be stickin around for a minute
PLUS, I'll be on my way; you sound like somebody
Who sound like somebody, I don't believe NUTTIN you say (say)
I will make your group feel like SHIT!
Plus he hang where I hang, nigga I will take your booth
We get (down)

[Chorus]
