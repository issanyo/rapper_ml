[Hook: Royce Da 5'9"]
But I'mma let you tell it
And you can ask me who's the illest around
But I'mma let you tell it
Yeah, I can probably tell you my opinion on that
But I'mma let you tell it
Don't ask me, "Who the illest MC?"
I'mma let you tell it

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
It ain't rocket science, I know you ain't cock no iron
I know who you run behind if them shots is flyin'
I know who the crime, the crook, the lolly gag sets
The rhymes, the book, the hookers who probably have sex
The kinds, the shook ones, the pawns the rook
And how the lines would look, if I'm hooked to a polygraph test
Call me papi, the best, the answer to the solution
To the problem in hip hop, you copy the test
I'm the cockiest catch, you a throw
You the treat at the end of my hook, you the eaten
You a ho, you seem to be 'bout losing
There seem to be parts of my style, lingerin' in your bowel movement
I took the courage and built my own company
I own somethin' that's why I purchased the silk tie
This is words to live by, watch your words
Cause words trigger the trigger herbs get killed by
Shut up it's two shooters, bet I can give you a tip
Get a new whip and set up a new jeweler
Get wet up this .2 2 will, light up your head
And exit your lip and swell up your soup coolers
All your teams involved in things
That enter in your body and end all your dreams
Enter in your shoulder, exit out your ass
Hittin' every organ like a pinball machine

But I'mma let you tell it
And you can ask me who's the illest around

I'mma let you tell it

[Verse 2: Kid Vishis]
Vishis in this bitch
With something that will melt you like Dorothy did the witch
You backtalk, nigga, and gats spark, nigga
Bust shots at your bike, make them catwalk, nigga
We ain't stingy, we will let you have it
Guns drawn on command like Inspector Gadget
Boom! They call me the Kid but I don't play
You don't know me so me and T.I. feel the same way
Blat! ASAP, fire melt into your wave cap
Push your hairline back, give you the George Jefferson
Learn your lesson, try to test and get aggressive
Smith & Wessons at your chest will make a mess and leave your vest
Whole fleet hold heat, trusty O.G
Go before he blow you lonely
Two 4's chromy, not rims, homie
Loud sound, light's out like James Toney
Maroon goons with rifles, boom boom your idol
[?] will fight you, dude will bite you
Mike Tyson trifling, fighting lives with knives
Despite a license, we're riding with 9's
The kid with no nonsense, we're riding for mines
The team for no nonsense, we ride or die
Eyes, red, I'm high, [?]
I'm fly, wise guy, why ask why we live, mister
Nice guy with wives, I'd pipe your bride
Many tried, none survived their crime
Call it drama, whole armada's the problem
All bearing revolvers, click and your clique's stalling
Yes y'all, involved in what you call arson
Spit fire contents, meat market your carcass
Trying to creep, put them where the crocodiles sleep
Guns don't cock, we just let the fully automatic heat
Boom!
