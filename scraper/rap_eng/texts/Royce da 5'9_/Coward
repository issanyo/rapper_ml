[Intro: Kid Vishis]
Aww shit
Oh
Oh
Kid Vishis
I'm the prince
Yeah

[Verse 1: Kid Vishis]
New niggas dress like women, acting like that's fresh
You young thugs got so much to address
That's a mess, ain't you gangsta with it?
How you gon' bang with Vishis when you're gangstalicious?
You're just a young fella
Don't try to stop the apocalypse with your umbrella
Shock ya shit when I fuck a clip at your ear
Then ask you, "what did the gun tell ya?"
It said, "bye"
Doctor said I would be stillborn, but I was still born
With little horns, and minions that will kill for ‘em
About millions in real form, you’re over the hill, cause your skills gone
I'm the prince, kneel before 'em
So don’t fuck with that
They say "every swing Vishis will end and break everything into your bucket hat"
‘Cause you suck at rap, up front and in fact [?]
The gat will kick, like a punter but no one will be running it back
My mic sounds nice, but why you so mean?
Mind your fucking business, or take one for the team
I am sick, MCs sleep on me, I am the pitch to your dreams

[Chorus: Kid Vishis]
He a killer to you
To me? He a motherfucking coward
Ask him why he ain’t collide with Vish, he’ll tell you
‘Cause he a motherfucking coward

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Fresh off the block nigga
Never knew a man until you fucked his ex, then he starts acting like a mark
I show up to his territory, draw an X, mark the spot
Give you a head start then you going head first off the, dogma
Time is money, I'm never off the clock
I'm awkward as a sarcophagus locked in a coffin
I'm opposite, a Cyclops with a horn
Armed like Optimus Prime in my supernatural form like, Oculus
Fiends is watching it, prostitute shares be knocking it
Ridiculous senior citizens in chairs be rocking it
Yeah, but we ain't stopping it there
You would rather have me shoot at your feet than hop in the square
For you opt to hop in that square
Circle with brothers who box, I can just dare niggas to just stop and just stare
Pam, pam, pam, that's the sound of a clown getting pounded out of the fucking Audi
And it comes down to him being a coward

[Chorus: Kid Vishis]
He a killer to you
To me? He a motherfucking coward
Ask him why he ain’t collide with Vish, he’ll tell you
‘Cause he a motherfucking coward

[Verse 3: Kid Vishis]
Yeah, any nigga he wit saying he could beat Vish
Beavis, tell them buttheads I said "eat shit"
We don't choose to cruise to fool music
I'd say lyrics ain't cool, too, if I couldn't do it
You ain't the bomb, you ain't no expert
The tec squirt and knock you out your Kanye West skirt
You not a G, I don't like aggressive raps
That's because the type of male you are is a fee
Get it? Female, going to detail
Your girl will sell like retail as I derail from the facts
You weak as hell, I whip beats with six speech through speakers
Pig squeak, your lips deep and shit's creek
He don't want a feature, how?
Cause they know the punches come like a bus driver
"You going to jail now"
He gonna be known for getting hit and fell down
But well, clown, cut up your kidney, cut up
My advice, shut the fuck up, pucker up with my gun but your fun's up
Run your funds, chump, better be one lumped sum or you'll get some lumps
Are you not entertained, I’m the syringe to your jugular vein, goodbye
