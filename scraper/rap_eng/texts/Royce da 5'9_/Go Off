[Chorus: Kid Vishis]
Yeah
What up though?
Yeah, lighters in the air, come on
We gon' do this shit like Blade was alive
Uh-huh, yeah
We gon' do this shit like Proof was alive (Detroit respect)
Uh-huh, yeah
We gon' do this shit like Dilla was alive
Uh-huh, yeah
Yeah nigga, go off

[Verse 1: Kid Vishis]
Ain't nobody vicious as me, besides Nickel
But nigga, a nigga nickel as me, my two of a kind self
Call for help, catch a damn round
You play 'round and this man down
No sound on the damn ground
Still don't give a fuck like the old Em
You ain't got soul in your music cause you sold them
I go off fate, I get to Heaven
If they don't let me in I'mma pole vault the gate
Waitin' patiently in your bushes, see you in claptois
That poised, stomp you rap boys like the frat boys
Wanna throw you suck up hoe, fuck you, fuck the flow
You such a sucka duck, you duck into a uppercut
I get such a rush, provin' y'all can't fuck with us
Your movement is losin', I think it's time to pucker up
Confusin' music with what you really doin' creates illusions
The ganders of delusions, the grandeurs of accusin' you of being
Swayed with the answers, mayday
They ain't sayin' "grace to the Lord", but guess what, they pray
And god blessin' all the dope rappers
And I'm the future of this, yeah I'm a trap rapper
Cause I bake rappers to diss so I can smack rappers, see
Sound like a trap to me
That's why I lead off hitters that be on Twitter
To see y'all spittas and then tee off on niggas
I'm a legend

[Chorus: Kid Vishis]
Yeah
(You know legends never die, you know)
Uh-huh, yeah
(Especially when they got people)
We gon' do this shit like Blade was alive
(That'll keep that legacy going)
Uh-huh, yeah
(Real Detroit shit)
We gon' do this shit like Proof was alive (Detroit respect)
(Rest in peace)
Uh-huh, yeah
We gon' do this shit like Dilla was alive (we love you)
(All the fallen soldiers)
Uh-huh, yeah
Yeah nigga, go off

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Montgomery bitch, Montgomery bitch
I knew ever since I was a youngin, I was gonna be rich
If I make you niggas uncomfortable, stumpin' through the city
Off on my lonely misery love company, come for me bitch
I got my mind right, father, mom right
I got my lemon squeezed back on my hip, I'm finally out the limelight
Everybody tryna' catch up to me, maybe one day by the time might
Until that day happens, I'm lookin' at that shit in hindsight
Which is in fact 20/20, my competition is wack
How can you race to make a run for the money when you actually come from the money?
Lyrical silver spooners, my niggas is really soldiers, y'all niggas is Ricky Schroder
I'm in the zone like Nate Robinson
My guns is on the drone, they straight poppin'
I'ma come kill you niggas with the floater
I'm in the lowest, 'bout to roll up when it's snowin'
Just to pull your car and let you know you dealin' with the coldest

[Chorus: Kid Vishis]
Yeah
(You know legends never die, you know)
Uh-huh, yeah
(Especially when they got people)
We gon' do this shit like Blade was alive
(That'll keep that legacy going)
Uh-huh, yeah
(Real Detroit shit)
We gon' do this shit like Proof was alive (Detroit respect)
(Rest in peace)
Uh-huh, yeah
We gon' do this shit like Dilla was alive (we love you)
(All the fallen soldiers)
Uh-huh, yeah
Yeah nigga, go off!
