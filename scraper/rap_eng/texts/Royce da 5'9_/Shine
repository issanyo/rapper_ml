[Intro]
Just shine your light on the world
So shine your light on the world
No matter anywhere you go, keep
Shining your light on the world
Don't let the money make you thirsty
Don't even let it be your goal
Just let it come and keep on working
And shine your light on them hoes
Cause I'm the hardest nigga out here
I'd rather die than live a life of fear
I know I got to be down here
To shine my light on them hoes
Hardest nigga out here
I'd rather starve than live a life of fear
I feel like God sent me down here
To shine my light on them hoes

[Verse 1]
Lost in the world when me and my girlfriend meet, bless you
You know they say "if you fucked her and she didn't cum
And you came, then she fucked you"
We squeeze first, nigga these ain't rebuttals
These street sweepers, we dump til he jump brooms
Like these nuptials, in the D where dreams come true
This is the the story of a man who's trying to break his doubts
Down like his cases count
Obsessive compulsive counting dough
Making sure all the numbers on the inside
And all the faces out
Lawyers on retainers like they braces out
Say my name wrong, I make you taste your mouth
Money come, money go
Get it but don't splurge it
Your boy's greed and war's needs
Got their own purpose
There's more than four speeds on that Porsche Turbo
It's sitting on four G's like my phone service
I'm out here trapping, but this here's sincere rapping
Dear assassin, you can't kill a signed and sealed classic
Gazelles and Bill Blasses, snake skin troops
Reptile enemies X'd out is what make men true
I'm blacking just like Jamaicans do
I'm running long side your coupe
Tapping guns upon your Wrathe window
Like Ox in Belly, got more Glocks and cellies
Than New Yorks got blocks and delis
Cops and boxes of pirellis, their doors' ajar
Exposing  my Maserati's guts
And that's what got you jelly
The car I'm driving got a pot belly

[Chorus]
I'm out here trapping
With this here sincere rapping
I've been shooting straight
Since two inch tape
This is for real classic
And getting money was never part of my goals
It just came along with me shining my light on them hoes
I've been out here trapping
With this here sincere rap
For fifteen years, I ain't leaving here without a classic
I get money, get money money dough
All I came to do is shine my light on them hoes

[Verse 2]
Hip-hop is my house; watch these philosophies win
Around artists I stand out like I locked my keys in
I forgot my goal at twenty-three was make a classic
Walk away like Tiger with my nine iron then take the master's
They say that you get what you ask for
Well, I asked to be left alone with my pen, pad and passport
This ain't no rags to rich brag shit
In fact, it's more close to being a rich to rags story
The fabric I'm cut from's the most genuine article mankind offers
I'm like an underground landmine talking
For Storch, Hammer & Antoine Walker
And your boy's a tampon
In every store I'm anti-corporate
Highest exalted, call me commercial? I'm highly insulted
This is Royce da 5'9", mind body and soul shit
All I have in this fucking globe is my shotty and flow
I'd rather let the coroner outline my body in chalk
Than let the fans order me 'round the clock and buy me in bulk

[Chorus]
I'm out here trapping
With this here sincere rapping
I've been shooting straight
Since two inch tape
This is for real classic
And getting money was never part of my goals
It just came along with me shining my light on them hoes
I've been out here trapping
With this here sincere rap
For fifteen years, I ain't leaving here without a classic
I get money, get money money dough
All I came to do is shine my light on them hoes

[Verse 3]
We move in silence, y'all ain't hearing us coming
I was sent by God to provide that imperial sonnage
Ya'll assembly line of rhymers really don't want it
I'll eat you for breakfast, one by one I got ya'll serial numbers
I'm about to send a tweet out to my nigga Styles
Tell him he got the juice now
Call my OG Scarface, talk some boxing with him
Perhaps these new clowns, politic perhaps
About a new him and Royce track
I'm feeling like D to the O to the C
When he got his voice back
Ha, I'm feeling like Cube in a fresh El Camino
Rolling key low g rolling through Detroit's back
Streets waving to all my people
I'm feeling more at home than Reese Taylor
This are what memories are made of
I remember each grudge, each favor
Each lie, each judge, each bailiff
Each job, cheap labor
Each neighbor, each caper
Each Mosque, each Church
Each pastor, pew, and casket
Each future bastard double dutching  through the madness, singing:

[Outro]
Just shine your light on the world
So shine your light on the world
No matter anywhere you go, kid
Shining your light on the world
Don't let the money make you thirsty
Don't even let it be your goal
Just let it come and keep on working
And shine your light on the hoes
Cause I'm the hardest nigga out here
I'd rather die than live a life of fear
I know I got to be down here
To shine my light on them hoes
Hardest nigga out here
I'd rather starve than live a life of fear
I feel like God sent me down here
To shine my light on them hoes
