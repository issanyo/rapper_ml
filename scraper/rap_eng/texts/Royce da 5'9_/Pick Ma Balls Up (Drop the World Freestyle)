I done been through the ups
Been through the downs
Sharpened the flow
Ginsu'd the sound
I was tossed in the game
Then thrown out
You know you in
When your friends want out
Fans get cocky tryna visualise my pockets
Really y'all should stop it
Quit criticising my topics
They say he rap about dick so much you could predict his lines
But the hits they listening to is all about bricks and shine
And this is fine
Wait, let me pick your mind
Everybody's a rapper now into it to get em signed
Y'all with em fakin' rap
What's the use in speaking how you truly feel
If you gon have to turn around and take it back
Joey taught me don't make your life an open book to them trust me
Cause it will fuck your shit up plus them niggas is touchy
But the race I'm running is against rappers touchier than Rihanna and Kanye in London
Ok I'm done and
I'm guilty for rappin about thuggin' and not about lovin
I'm deeper and darker
For me beef is easier to talk a-
I'm a beast when I'm deep in thought
Diss me you reachin, I ether the author
Fly as a bitch leavin the park
Before I'm demonstrating
You talking loud like Mystikal in '98
I'm here, you talk soft like Ray-J in elimination
Back off to the brothers
Hats off to the others
White fans is mad, they red like hacksaw jim-duggan
Yeah, I will stick you up
I spit barbiturates
My triggers will lift you up
They say I talk about my dick too much
I'm about it, I done went a whole verse without talking bout it
I'm a pick my dick up and I'm stick it in your bitches head
Yeah I'mma pick my nuts up and I'm a drop 'em on your fucking head
Yeah, say I can die now and rebirth muthafucker
Hop up on the spaceship and leave Earth muthafucker
I'm gone, yeah I'm gone
Uhh
Now which one of y'all is going home with a trigger
Ruin your figure-er? Haha
Now which one of y'all is going home with a trigger
Ruin your figure? Er?
Ow
