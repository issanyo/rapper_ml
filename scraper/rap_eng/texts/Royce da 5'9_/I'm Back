[Verse 1: Knonam]
These rappers wanna talk like their walk is bad
But somebody please tell 'em that their posture's bad
If I see 'em with a lot of cash
I'm gonna stop and grab another shot, put it on his tab
And by the way, I just called a cab
So tell that rapper if he really wants his wallet back
That he should probably get a pocket with a lock, 'cuz damn
These little motherfuckers knew I pickpocket cats
(It's Killa K) .com, with a shotgun cocked in hand
And shotgun to your Ma's sedan
I spit shots at 'em walking past
Now, we shot more holes in his grill than a hockey mask
Look, you better watch it man
This white boy is lit, keep on burning like a Nazi flag
Cousin, this ain't a fucking game of Yahtzee man
Black masks and I punch, pop-lock, and, yeah
Two shots to grab them young dudes
Probably never even knew that 2Pac was black
And these girls wanna stop me like "That's what Maury Povitch said."
Bitch, I am not your dad
Look, they never knew I would've caused a crash
Between a car full of cops and a mazda van
You never would've guessed I would've socked your man
Off two beers, a wrong look, and a shot of Yak
Cause I'm back
Like boss, killers, I am the boss brother
The wrong mother fucker you was tryin' to cross
Cause I'm like back like ghetto blasters in the ghetto
Lettin' to that heavy metal blast til' I'm back in the ghetto
Cause I'm back like Pac and Biggie, Nas and Fifty
Off the city blocks like it was bronx and philly
Cause I'm back like *Illmatic*, still at it
Still got it, skill better than real killas that pack *Stillmatics*

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, Royce 5'9, Knonam what up, Minneapple, what up
Show you how I do where I'm from
I'm from the city where mother fuckers wearin' big chains
Whippin' Ranges, apparently carryin' big things
Bury you I don't care who you is, you will get the same
Be prepared cause the barrel he carryin goes
Now, come inside the mind of a mobster
Modified like nine times, more powerful than Mazdas
With the kinda arms that harm, you are not responsive
You can say I'm Sadaam, bitch ain't I the bomb

[Verse 3: Knonam]
Now he ain't messin' with me, you best believe
He gonna be leakin' out of his head
It's expertise, he's gonna be restin' in peace
I'm talkin dead, cause he tested
Immediately following these three questions
(Why) You keep lookin at me, (Why) you keep starin at me, nigga
(Why) You keep grillin' at me, my pistol 'bout to go BOOM

You can flip the semi-auto
Clips and lick a shot at the kid
And still miss anything I'm pimpin' on them
Or get up out it
Cause I'm crazy enough
To hit you with a tire swing while the kids are still sitting on it
You better change your top 10
Of Minnesota rappers in the game
When I aim he's dropped
It ain't no maybe spot
It's a break that top to replace it with some 80's pop
Cause I got that eagle
And they never saw me coming until I ran like a flock of seagulls
So I'mma drop that sequel
And they can't call me underground rap cause I'm not beneath you
What's beef?
Beef is something you cook until it's done
And you add a little ketchup and eat it between a bun
Beef is when I eat you
Right before you're in the ICU with no teeth

Cause I'm back
Like boss, killers, I am the boss brother
The wrong mother fucker you was tryin' to cross
Cause I'm like back like ghetto blasters in the ghetto
Lettin' to that heavy metal blast til' I'm back in the ghetto
Cause I'm back like Pac and Biggie, Nas and Fifty
Off the city blocks like it was bronx and philly
Cause I'm back like *Illmatic*, still at it
Still got it, skill better than real killas that pack *Stillmatics*

It's like Cool J, jackets, and broke chains
The hip hop biz what crack is to cocaine
Still be the baddest in '08
Reincarnating the classic like jazz did with Coal Train
Yeah with the fabric I sew
Paint pictures of Andy Warhol on the canvas with no paint
Practicing on a Campbell's can
Until the rap became what Warhol did with Marilyn Monroe's Face
Straight classic like Illmatic
Had it before Jay could diss him when he sampled The Doors
Take over five to one the grind is done
You're so behind the gun that the hammer's your nose ring
Sneeze and the barrel explodes
Tearing a hole out your face big enough to stick your hand in the whole thing
God bless you
Catch you walking your baby nuts round the block
I'll Chuck Liddel you
Hands off I'll Frank Shamrock your shit
And toss that grappling on you I'll sock that
Whole face off your shit the cast and ?
Or stand off like Jay, Cam'ron and ?
I swear beefing with me is a reason to leave your bedside
I'll Tito Ortiz your ???
Christopher Reeves your back
I'll roll up on you, change your style to 80's chains, all that foil?

Cause I'm back
Like boss, killers, I am the boss brother
The wrong mother fucker you was tryin' to cross
Cause I'm like back like ghetto blasters in the ghetto
Lettin' to that heavy metal blast til' I'm back in the ghetto
Cause I'm back like Pac and Biggie, Nas and Fifty
Off the city blocks like it was bronx and philly
Cause I'm back like *Illmatic*, still at it
Still got it, skill better than real killas that pack *Stillmatics*

I...
Will...
Not...
Lose

[Outro: Dane Cook]

Yeah, I said it like that, I said it like that
God bless you
Which, you know, is God bless you
But it kinda sounded like
Cover your fuckin' mouth
Yeah, incognito
