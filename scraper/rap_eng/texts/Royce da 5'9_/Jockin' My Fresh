Quit jockin' my fresh

Chorus:
Easily I approach
The microphone because I ain't no joke
Tell ya momma to get off of my nuts
She need to quit
"Jockin' my fresh" - Jay-Z
Easily I could smoke
Your hypertone, nigga you ain't no loc
Tell your girlfriend to get off of my dick
She need to quit
"Jockin' my fresh" - Jay-Z

Verse One:
I'm on fire survival, admire you liar
Who higher, new tires, flew by you
Dubai ya, Brunei ya, the new sire
Each line, I think it's lightning
What you think is writin'
Is my ink ignitin'
I stole that from L
But I don't think it's bitin'
Beef is heightened on side of the stage
Speakin' of fightin'
I write like I pull my pen out the side of a grenade
Imperial, serial killers in front of a mural of Dilla, Proof, Blade
A burial crusade
Venereal, flu, A.I.D.S
I'm sick
I'm too paid
I'm rich
I will flower a chicken like a bouquet
I'm sentimental
End up with your dental
Loose cave
Bitch we ain't Friends;
I ain't Phoebe Buffay!
I'm a motherfuckin' Superstar like Lupe
Get a lot of vagina
Stylin' like I'm a designer
Whoever hotter than me
I probably find him and sign him
He Connected, I probably supply him, it's eeeeeasy

Chorus

Verse Two:
The product is like Prada
A lotta shottas'll stretch you
Until you tired of violence I'm the rider bitch y'all the liars
Y'all retired your guns just cause you signed a deal
I'm the Youth Fountain on Truth Mountain on Honest Hill
Who's countin'?
I'm tryin' to build beyond a mill
Don't call me seven nine's cause I'm tryin' to find a bill(ion)
True is, who is down to kill
Old school like a Buick Bonneville
Suicide, do a lot of pills
Who you gotta to kill
Beef is easy to me bitch
Guns, grams, get 'em, got 'em all, strict G shit
Honestly, round 'em up, found 'em slumped
Down a buck, llama tucked
Grind till you tired of us
I'm on your head like a Yarmulke

Chorus

Outro:
I'm gonna tell y'all niggas right now. Number one
Quit jockin' my motherfuckin' fresh. Number two
If you ain't feelin' me...you a fuckin' corn dog
You sleepin' on me like you a little baby
