[Hook]
United we stand, divided we ball
We fight and we brawl, inside of a bar
United we stand, divided we ball
Inside of a bar, we fight and we brawl
United we stand, divided we ball
We fight and we brawl, inside of a bar
United we stand, divided we ball
Inside of a bar, we fight and we brawl

[Verse 1]
These money niggas make more money than y'all thinking
It's funny how we make more money than y'all blinking
That's when you want to come in deep, but y'all sinking
And it ain't nothing over here sweet, so start thinking
We Motown, it's right here were the dough found
Spit the most rounds, we all ball inside a ghost town
Wall Street, we be the first to call beef
Walking up to me, it's gonna cost you all of your teeth
Made men that will do you in for a fee
Doing drive-bys inside a 6 or a B
Ask women who's the hottest and they say me
Ask niggas who's the hardest, they say me
Ask your mom who's the smartest, she says me
And as far as whose songs hitting the hardest, they play me
Im'ma show the ladies what I'm made of from NY to LA
N.W.A, LL way

[Hook]
United we stand, divided we ball
We fight and we brawl, inside of a bar
United we stand, divided we ball
Inside of a bar, we fight and we brawl
United we stand, divided we ball
We fight and we brawl, inside of a bar
United we stand, divided we ball
Inside of a bar, we fight and we brawl

[Verse 2]
How many niggas is you killing with?
How many millions and women with whips is you dealing with?
Tell me how you ball, buy out the mall
Or maybe go on tour and fly out tomorrow
Yo, where's your funds at and all that ice and shit?
Or where's your guns at and all of the knives and shit?
Seeing women with class in a street full of tricks
Leaving the shoe store with a jeep full of kicks
A yo, I'm frostbit, ice on my chest, I lost it
I walk in, stripes on my vest then talk shit
Diamonds is like shining bright lights
With more karats than average, sweating and blinding your eyesight
We make cream, legal, my chain is too sturdy
Who got game? We don't play clean, we too dirty
Black Jesus, the women in track pleaser
Keep a stack under my cap and max Visas
Showing love up in the club
Hot, showing up with thugs, stop going up for drugs
Subdue you, come on your set and get respect
Just listen to Clue, Funk Flex, and Sway & Tech
When you hear me, you can't front so don't start
I roll with lone sharks with guns and phone cards
Come through with the crushed linen
Benzes with the plushed finish, glass tint, and it's all for the women

[Hook]
United we stand, divided we ball
We fight and we brawl, inside of a bar
United we stand, divided we ball
Inside of a bar, we fight and we brawl
United we stand, divided we ball
We fight and we brawl, inside of a bar
United we stand, divided we ball
Inside of a bar, we fight and we brawl

[Verse 3]
We lighten you up, got you niggas tightening up
Knives or spikes on fight night, slicing you up
One of each, Lex rented with sex in it
Bottom line, come in peace or rest in it
These money niggas ain't playing with y'all this year
We tripling yours and y'all worked hard this year
Then we laid back then became stars this year
We're hard to meet, y'all niggas is hard to hear
We're trying to make a million, fuck all of these other rap niggas
Think they hold weight in the street cause they act bigger
That's how you turn whacked on your back on the river
Or get slapped or snatched out of your AC figure
I'm nice and you can't deny me for shit, nigga
Shot and split up, gotten rid of for six figures
Real niggas, that's why I'm in the clique
I done scratched the serial more times than you itch
Icy and flossy, yeah it's nice but it costs me
Like twice what you offered, pricey and glossy
Roll out the red carpet, they're bringing in Royce
The last man standing on Earth, the king of Detroit

[Hook]
United we stand, divided we ball
We fight and we brawl, inside of a bar
United we stand, divided we ball
Inside of a bar, we fight and we brawl
United we stand, divided we ball
We fight and we brawl, inside of a bar
United we stand, divided we ball
Inside of a bar, we fight and we brawl

[Outro]
These money niggas make more money than y'all thinking
It's funny how we make more money than y'all blinking
That's when you want to come in deep, but y'all sinking
And it ain't nothing here sweet, so start thinking
