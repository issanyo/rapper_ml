[Royce talking]
Yeah, this one is for my niggas that's locked up
I know you don't get a lot of letters from me, we don't talk on the phone
So hopefully I can do this shit for you
And it'll last longer than any letter or any phone call
I love y'all niggas man, I never forget about y'all
Yeah man just be busy, shit'll be right when y'all get out. For sho' [fades]

[Royce-1st verse]
Dear Cash, what's goin' on my nigga?
Seem like it's been so long my nigga
I ain't even get a chance to say so long my nigga
When I heard you was gone I was out pourin' my nigga
Go head' and knock your time out, I know it's borin' my nigga
Consider this a letter in the form of a song my nigga
Everything cool in the city, nigga we foolin' it's pretty
Me and my 'cous like Biggie and Diddy
Out here spendin' that dough
Tryin' to get my label to it's plateau
In fact bro
You know how that go
I'm lovin' this approach
Half of these niggas out here they waitin' on a bag
And the others just broke
It's hard not to stand out when we the only ones spendin'
Gettin' a whole bunch of attention from a whole bunch of women
You said they'd be back on my nuts, I listen to you bro
And I ain't gotta tell you I love you my nigga you know

[Hook]
"Gotta find me an angel"
Just remember the hook
Just remember the hook
Just remember the hook
My nigga
"Fly away"
Just remember the hook
If it don't even change the way that you feel
"Gotta find me an angel"
Just remember the hook
Just remember the hook
And I'ma' get yo ass through that bid my nigga
"And set me free"
Just remember the hook
Just remember the hook my nigga
"Gotta find me an"

[Verse Two]
Dear Ivan, what up cuzo?
I heard you got all diesel and shit what's crackin'
You only was supposed to do a couple of years what happened
Nigga you must be in there scrappin'
You a wild boy
Listen, my nigga get through your bid
If you don't do it for you, do it for your kids
Do it for the fact that they think that since you black
And young and got a temper that you'll probably be back
To them you just a number my nigga
You way too smart for this shit
And we ain't gettin' no younger my nigga
You know what the parole board gon' say
And when they do we comin' to get you
To go and get ya wardrobe straight
And then
We takin' you to get fucked, sucked, fucked up
Nigga you rollin' with us
Other than your brother nobody gon' cover you quite the way I do
Cause you my mothafuckin' cousin I love you
Fo' life

[Hook]
"Gotta find me an angel"
Just remember the hook
Just remember the hook
Just remember the hook
My nigga
"Fly away"
Just remember the hook
If it don't even change the way that you feel
"Gotta find me an angel"
Just remember the hook
Just remember the hook
And I'ma' get yo ass through that bid my nigga
"And set me free"
Just remember the hook
Just remember the hook my nigga
"Gotta find me an"

[Verse Three]
Dear Murray, (huh)
What's goin' on cousin?
Awe man you wild, yo my phone was buzzin'
I heard what you did
But fuck it, it hurts me just knowin'
That they caught you and talkin' about it is certainly annoyin'
So how you doin' family?
I heard you was flowin'
And all you do is work out, write verses to songs
If you ain't puttin' me on
And you really serious
When you get out
I'mma be puttin' you on, you know?
See if you wanna stunt
I could visit you wearin' a shirt that say "free you" on the front
Them niggas would be like
"This nigga had Royce 5'9 boopty-woop Blahzy-splee" you know how they talk
Niggas be braggin' about you
In fact, I was at the club the other day bitches was askin about you
Other than your mother nobody can cover you quite the way I do
Cause you my mothafuckin' cousin I love you
Fo' life

[Hook]
"Gotta find me an angel"
Just remember the hook
Just remember the hook
Just remember the hook
My nigga
"Fly away"
Just remember the hook
If it don't even change the way that you feel
"Gotta find me an angel"
Just remember the hook
Just remember the hook
And I'ma' get yo ass through that bid my nigga
"And set me free"
Just remember the hook
Just remember the hook my nigga
"Gotta find me an"

[Outro]
"I got a call the other day
And when I got there..."
