I was asked a question that whether or not people should have access under our constitution of laws to automatic weapons and I refer to report these factual situation
And in fact under our constitution of laws such access is allowed
I will state [?] though that I am a supporter of the Second Amendment and I believe strongly that law by the citizen should
Have their right to keep [?]
Now we know criminals by definition are people who don't obey laws, therefore you can pass all the laws you want they will still have access to these weapons
That means you end up with a situation in which the law by the folks and the crooks have all the guns...
