Royce Da 5'9

Nickel, Yall know what it do, riding, thing on my side, Im about that life right, Doug what up


Chorus

Cause they don't know i got that thing on my side
Ride to the death go all the way like
To my last Breath Dog way to fly
Anywhere i step Im Made to survive
Never have regrets they don't know about that, about that, about that , no oh oh oh
They don't know about that , about that, about that, no oh no


Royce Da 5'9

I'm on my detroit state of mind
Made to survive, built to destroy, blaze with da 9
Waving goodbye
Guess Im just a reckless detroiter, I grease bullets with all my canadian g's who will pull it
I call em my edmonton oilers, Im about that, Like that life that you ran
Like your last day your last breath could land right inside your ashtray
Patron & big blunts cause yeh homie you only live once
Yall niggas sleeping you narcoleptic
The difference between us you bough a car im a car collector
I put the law on all of my offenders
I put the I in i will you end you
I'm flying wondering which one is flyer, the chick I'm riding with
Or the tires on the new carbon fibre fender
I got a gauge, who busting its nothing
I drag the whole united states threw customs
Pinnacle touch it, criminal fuck it


Chorus

Cause they don't know i got that thing on my side
Ride to the death go all the way like
To my last Breath Dog way to fly
Anywhere i step Im Made to survive
Never have regrets they don't know about that, about that, about that , no oh oh oh
They don't know about that , about that, about that, no o


2nd verse Doug Crawford

How quick my life seemed 2 change direction
I learned hard times only breed perfection
When in ur town Ur braud pleads  affection
If that's a problem U might  need police protection
See half of what u need is connection
Have drive take advice head correction
Never have regrets B happy with  my  reflection  wanna find me
Ib in the rhythm & blues section 8
Next to the dudes that never lose
Everything Strategize only make clever moves
Might as well quit if I can't improve
Its the life that I chose arms now full of tattoos 12
I no longer live with regrets
Getting high in my sweats I don't care who it's upsets
Life in fastlane all I see is silhouettes
Where im at mans as Good as it gets


Chorus

Cause they don't know i got that thing on my side
Ride to the death go all the way like
To my last Breath Dog way to fly
Anywhere i step Im Made to survive
Never have regrets they don't know about that, about that, about that , no oh oh oh
They don't know about that , about that, about that, no o
