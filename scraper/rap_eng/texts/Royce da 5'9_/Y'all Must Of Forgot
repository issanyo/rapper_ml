*Freestyle over Scarface's 'Forgot About Me'. Produced by Cool & Dre

[Intro] [Royce talking]:
"I know they missing you"
Nickle. One of my niggas said to me one time. He said...he said to me, he said...

[Verse One]:
"Niggas ain't checkin' for you, you gotta reinvent."
Bitch, I pull out the dick and I put the 'P' in 'pimp'
And y'all must of forgot, Nickle be tec holdin'
My bitch Super Bad, yours looks like Seth Rogan

[Hook]:
East coast you sleepin'
Wake up
West coast you sleepin'
Wake up
Nickle 9 is here nigga
Wake up
(Y'all must of forgot)

Like Roy Jones said, gon' 'head
The hoe with me got her own bread with long legs
I got a squady like Gotti, I am Capone bred
Ridin' in a spaceship with a clip full of Coneheads
Nigga please they tryin' to cook me a manish raw
It's like tryin' to give a centipede a manicure
Word
You know that you ain't even in my classa
Herb
Cremate you and sprinkle you in my pasta
I'm fed off my publishin'
I call my bitch a Klingon cause she cling on my nuts and her head on some other shit
Face it you can't say shit
I bring a problem to you, turn you into Kim Kardashian, you can't shake it
Somebody tell these little boys I'm manic with the bars
Invitin' me to dance and end up Dancing With The Stars
Don't diss me cause I'm the reason why you livin'
This ain't Mysonne and Ness nigga, this is Tyson and Robin Givens

[Hook]:
Left coast you sleepin'
Wake up
East coast you sleepin'
Wake up
Southside you sleepin'
Wake up
(Y'all must of forgot)

[Verse Two]:
Like the before Roy, not after Tarver
Give you a pass, it ain't your time like Travis Barker
I still got my guard up so you ain't safe yet
I still make it your time like Flava Flav's neck
I bury a nigga pen right where the slain's flow be
With one hit, one buzzer beater like Shane Mosley
I'm from the murder capitol packed with them plain clothes
Insane O.G.'s with a name for slain soldiers
You can't lift him up
You can't stick him up
He in his own lane, he move like McCain's shoulders
The game over
Fuck chest, I bang heads
You either finna be duck lucky or brain dead
I'm twice as intelligent
I'm like Norman Bates takin' advice from one of my dead relatives
Like I can smell drama
My dead grandma
Told me to Knock You Out like she LL Mama

[Chorus]:
Worldstar you sleepin'
Wake up
Internet you sleepin'
Wake up
Everybody that ain't fuckin' with me
(Y'all must of forgot)

[Verse Three]:
Look at me, you see no flaws
You history, I'm like Debo's drawers, I'm on a shit streak
You can't ruin it, we're streakin'!
The flows like Frank naked in the street, ain't nobody else doin' it
I'm the shit fool
I take dudes to I'm The Shit School
Teach 'em, you can either sleep on me or get cool
I'm crack, in fact, I got a trapper flow
I got harder for those packs than Shaq will go
The average rapper's a nerd, they throw the peace sign
The roll up with they Geek Squad to the Apple Sto'
Y'all forgot he an Eminem product
He spot a snake in the grass that's cause there's venom inside him
And y'all hoes
Y'all should sell my CD at the pharmacy
And yours should be in the isle with feminine products
Gentlemen nada
We sick
I sucker punch a nigga, leave his hat suspended in the air like E6

[Chorus]:
West coast you sleepin'
Wake up
Major labels you sleepin'
Wake up
DJ's
(Y'all must of forgot)

[Verse Four]:
Fuck it, fo' verses, mo' verses
The single six oh
The ?
My trigger finger start itchin' I'm scratchin' yo' surface
The flow perfect, I don't pose for no person
I break your camera like I'm Kanye West
I'm hard to swallow
Y'all get model's I get they throat workin'
Cut off his toes like Chicago bloggers
If he, act like a little baby, I'mma let the fo' burp him
When I walk in the booth, you can hear tires squeal
Then you hear sirens near the engineer's in riot gear
The FEDS prepare to raid him, come through and barricade him
I threaten good and I execute for who there to trade him
I am Premier's assailant, flossy, I'm frost bit
I'm surrounded by mo' ice than Sarah Palin
I photo bomb Biden even though Obama bitin'
I'm a nigga with power, dig it, like I'm Osiris
Hahaha

[Chorus]:
Sleepin'
Wake up!
(Y'all must of forgot)

[Outro] [Royce talking]:
Verse five...psych
