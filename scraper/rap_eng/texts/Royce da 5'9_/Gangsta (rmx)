[Intro: Royce Da 5'9" (w/ Akon)]
(Gangster, gangster, gangster)
(Gangster, gangster, gangster)

Now you fools know that goon come out after dark
(Gangster, gangster, gangster)
The moon comes up, you know where we are
(Gangster, gangster, gangster)

[Bridge: Royce Da 5'9" (w/ Akon)]
Don't make me get started, I don't make peace
I'm a (gangster), I'm a (gangster), I'll make your [?]
Don't make me, you don't want to hear do, re, mi
From a (gangster), from a (gangster), from a (gangster)
Nigga don't hate me, I got the AK, I'll spray ya
Now your bitch text us like H-Town players
Bring it to your nugget like AI, I dare ya
But Im'ma let Akon flare ya

[Hook: Akon (w/ Royce Da 5'9")]
Nigga don't make me have to step in the club with my dogs
And show all you motherfuckers how we ball
Nigga don't make me show you how I can violate the law
Get your woman, go up in her raw dog
Now the ho love me, waiting to show me
(Look, bitch you just a fuck) and that how she gon' be
But niggas wanna handcuff of l.o.v.e
Steady claiming they're a pimp but will let her go free
Man that ain't gangster, they're just fronting like they're hard
But I'm knowing that they're pussy from the start
Man that ain't gangster, still in the projects
But I spent a hundred thousand on a car
I rather have a crib in Miami with a boat
Put all my niggas on so we don't go broke
Yeah show them the ropes, sticking together, niggas try to cope
Anyone step in the way will get (*gunshots*)

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, I'm 'bout to toe tag this
Leave your face looking like Justin Timberlake when he thought he owed taxes
Airball like Ray Charles with no glasses
I'm playing everything, instinct like Bo Jackson
I make niggas bow to the game before Madden
But no passing, just flows and fours flashing
Oh, I'm so, I'm so old-fashioned
Knife up close, I poke and throat slashing
I don't slang dope, I smoke and pump passion
I don't piss, I point dick and dump ashes
I married the game, I estimated I should get out
Tonight is guaranteed, yesterday was not
I live by the way of Carlito, I'm tied to the streets
But one cut can separate the knot
I start off big, but my voice escalate to Pac
Christmas spirit, light up trees and decorate the block
That Halloween light up the green lant, bring back, we

(Gangster, gangster, gangster)
The moon comes up, you know where we are
(Gangster, gangster, gangster)

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9" (w/ Akon)]
We out here, your bitch went from nowhere to now here
(Gangster, gangster, gangster)
Put it together, bullets together, who can compare to, I'm a
(Gangster, gangster, gangster)
My sound is flyer than a lot of producers, higher than Lollapalooza
(Gangster, gangster, gangster)
Jimi Hendrix done already OD so the semi ends this
(Gangster, gangster, gangster)
The king senses the dirt coming and he wrenches that off
(Gangster, gangster, gangster)
[?] when the semi-automatic gets jacked off
Like a (gangster, gangster), like a (gangster)
