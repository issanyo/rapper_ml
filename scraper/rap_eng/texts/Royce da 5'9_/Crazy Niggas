[Royce da 5'9 Speaking]
It's Nickel
I'm a thoroughbred D nigga or whatever right?
I fuck with these C.O.B niggas
I stamped them just like they stamped me
And if I say it's a stamp, it's a stamp
Cause I fuck with niggas that'll cut your fuckin' kids up
And put 'em somewhere

[Hook: Demetrius Capone]
Murder, murder murder
I'm the craziest nigga you ever heard of
Know what? Hold up
I'm a loony bin escapee
Rappers don't like me
Soon they gonna hate me

[Verse 1: Julius Luciano]
I sexually assault tracks man, the news reports state
The rape rate raised at an unusual rate
I'm sick, I'ma skeet in tube of Colgate
Make my bitche use it, tell her excuse the foreign taste
I wanna get felatt'd by every whore this track
Waitin' for Jordin Sparks to lose some more weight
My head's twisted I can't screw it on straight
I stick the knife in your head give you the unicorn face
Then I'm hackin' your faggot family tree
Put an axe to every branch and leave
My javelin's stabbin' your aunt and niece
Breakin' your ??? , wearin' a ski mask and a ski
I jab a spleen with a Japanese katana
And as you scream, you bleed on the television
I'mma sell this shit as a plasma screen
Maniac indeed, I went to the Garden of Eden
And talked Eve into shakin' her tambourines
She asked me was my dick bigger than Adam's, please
Pulled out my snake and two apples, something she hasn't seen
But fuck a bitch, all I need is a bathroom sink
A stack of KING magazines and some Vaseline

[Hook: Demetrius]
Murder, murder murder
I'm the craziest nigga you ever heard of
Know what? Hold up
My shit talk is automatic
And y'all faggots can't shit talk
Cause you toss salad

[Verse 2: Kenny Siegel]
I take the track and rape it
As long as the beat hard as ejaculation
I love bustin' like I'm addicted to masturbation
I'm sick of bitches callin' me manic
I plan to date psychiatric patients
Who get my assassinatin' fascination
And my decapitatin' bastards cravin'
I'll bang your daughter, have her callin' me daddy
Like I'm your damn replacement
My head is achin' and it's racin'
I hear a voice, and I can't escape it
They say I'm as manic as a fan of Satan
I'll sip on liquor til my liver shrivels, til my steerin' swivels
Til my walkin' ability becomes near a cripple's
Til I walk and topple over from the beer and ripple
Then point my pistol at whoever from I hear a giggle
I just might start spazzin' for no reason, clappin' straps
Sending bastards back to their home screamin'
Y'all think I give a fuck who I scratch? You hoes chiefin'
I'm nasty as guzzling a glass of your own semen
I'm on some fuck all humans, listen I'm monstrous
So I shoot blimey, like I'm missing a conscience
Like, fuck a direction my strap isn't a compass
If I hit innocent bystanders, mission accomplished

[Hook: Demetrius]
Murder, murder murder
I'm the craziest nigga you ever heard of
Know what? Hold up
See I'm tryna get dissed
If you a famous rapper
Then your mama is a bitch

[Verse 3: Demetrius]
Aye, who let the psycho possess a mic?
When I possess a f'n mic, yo I'm Reverend right?
I'd rather resurrect Michael instead of Christ
When I see the cops, like a Bible I tell 'em lies
Aye, I'm a bit out of the norm
Watchin' the scramble channel with animal porn
I chew through my mother's stomach
That's how a cannibal's born
We are backwards like Korn, wow
What if for fun, the gun clicker
Rewind time and find your mom as a young stripper
Let her unzip the zipper, get her liquored up
Dick her, cum in her, that's how I son niggas
After she have you I trash you
Reminiscing a young Brenda, just for fun
There's none sicker
I'll make a nun lick another nun's clito-ris
Slit your wrist prick, before you fuck with her
Killer, my game is quite sick
I got enough game to change a athiest racist white dyke
That just hates a light dick, like I'm
Anally rapin' her, I just came on some tight shit

[Hook: Demetrius]
Murder, murder murder
I'm the craziest nigga you ever heard of
Know what? Hold up
I'm a loony bin escapee
Rappers don't like me
Soon they gonna hate me

Murder, murder murder
I'm the craziest nigga you ever heard of
Know what? Hold up
See I'm tryna get dissed
If you a famous rapper
Then your mama is a bitch

[Royce speaking again]
Well if you're a famous rapper... your mama is a bitch
Haha, if you a famous rapper your mama is a bitch
I told Crook, I said "Crook man...
You got a motherfuckin' firing squad over here"
So it's official, I'm officially on my Slaughterhouse
Horseshoe G.A.N.G, motherfuckin' COB, Treacherous records tip
MIC Records is in the motherfuckin' building
Nickel nigga! Saucy I see you... yeah haha

[Outro: Dice Dinero]
Yo, it's the Horseshoe weekly
See you next week so
C.O.B easy
