[Verse 1]
The soldiers, the henchmen, fightin' for the dough
Allow me to give it to you, right from the door
Walkin through the steps of the rise and the fall hall
Of an empire, crumble to the floor
Through the wire like eight on a string
Where they gon' sting ya when it comes to that cold
Soldiers, hoes and vultures lurkin'
Lookin' for that work and
Hopin', they could make a couple dollars
Off another mothafuckin' bloody murder
It's the problem but no ho, it's the quality of knowin'
That the part of gettin' dough is you can't be out of control
If you gets in the way of my paper, by my skyscraper
We can chunk it, long as you ain't crossed that line
You can put me on the phone with your boss, we could squash it

[Chorus]
It's the meeting of the bosses, meeting of the bosses
Why don't you tell them lil' niggas "beat it we talkin'"
Meeting of the bosses, meeting of the bosses
Tell them lil' mothafuckers "shut up we talkin'"

It's the meeting of the bosses, meeting of the bosses
Why don't you tell them lil' niggas "beat it we talkin'"
Meeting of the bosses, meeting of the bosses
Tell them lil' mothafuckers "shut up we talkin'"

[Verse 2]
Huh, over weed, over yay, over not bein' paid
When he say he gon' see you
Petty ass niggas, them pathetic ass bitches
You could let 'em grab dick, they'll never have shit
In this world, but you niggas gon' learn it
Some of these wars at the point of no returnin'
Some of these boys at the point of no concernin'
Some of these courts at the point of no adjournin'
How many cars can you run up on before
Somebody wanna war, ain't nobody wanna talk
Hit you in the die hard, niggas momma's calling
Involvin' the law hard
Cross taped up to the chest
Enemies fuckin' with them boys for protection
If it's only one boss in your squadron
Then me and him need to be the only ones talking

[Chorus]
It's the meeting of the bosses, meeting of the bosses
Why don't you tell them lil' niggas "beat it we talkin'"
Meeting of the bosses, meeting of the bosses
Tell them lil' mothafuckers "shut up we talkin'"

[Verse 3]
Huh, all you have in this world is your word
Your gat and your guts, that and your nuts
Ain't no backin' you up, ain't no after you gone
The pastor of the church nigga, that's when it's on
The path that you own nigga, that's where you goin'
Clap if you want homes 'til your ass gone
Now you finally gotta kill
But the snowball is rollin' down that hill
Accumulatin' size, by the time it arrives
At the bottom of the hill, it be count as homicides
And avalanches for the ambiance outside you
Countless mommas cryin', sisters goin' Boo Boo
Niggas killin' cause of what they true to
Who's the villain here nigga, tell me what would you do
Huh, keep it goin', talk shit, squash it
You gon' have to talk to the bosses

[Chorus]
It's the meeting of the bosses, meeting of the bosses
Why don't you tell them lil' niggas "beat it we talkin'"
Meeting of the bosses, meeting of the bosses
Tell them lil' mothafuckers "shut up we talkin'"
