[Intro: Joe Budden]
Joey, Check this, look

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
I'm the realest motherfucker that I know
Wasn't always the case, guess a nigga had to grow
I do it all for love, if I pull it ain't for show
But i know these sucka niggas will so I gotta keep it close
I'd rather pool parties in a mansion full of hoes
And they love to hit the mirror in the bathroom just to pose
The game is full of fuck niggas, hope they get exposed
If we ain't [] with apropos
He keep a long nose, he relentless, rose from the trenches
The big body benzs' never been an apprentice
Preying on my foes through the scopes and the lenses
Came a long way from selling dope, jumping fences
That's what i'm entrenched with, you'll never see a gimmick
When it's me, its authentic, I don't feel the need to mimic at all
'cause my character speaks louder than my words will
And gossip moves faster than your hearse will

[Chorus: badXchannels]
Yea I see you like the lights off
Oh you like living with that mask on
Fuck all the bullshit show me passion
Money, power, I want it all
Yea I see you like the lights off
Can't believe it took me this long
Have you forgotten where you come from
Money, power, I want it all

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Countless studio hours, overnight sessions
On the road taking showers next to 7-Elevens
Doing shows at them venues when no one showed up
Performing just for opening acts and all the promoters
Waking up, bright and early making your way to them radio stations
Standing out front with your mixtape hoping DJs would play 'em
Using all the dough you saved to cop some promo T-shirts
Remixing every hit record with a Joell Ortiz verse
The labels'll take your meetings and just hurt your feelings
"he's overweight, he's Puerto Rican, don't look so appealing"
They crushed your dreams, got you leaving out Manhattan buildings
Thinking 'bout a Brooklyn way to hustle for you to feed your children
Put the passion got you back in the booth
You could've ripped your pad in half when they was passing on you
But niggas rapping whack and everything you spat is the truth
Blood, sweat, and tears, man that ain't half of it dude, i'm past due

[Chorus: badXchannels]
Yea I see you like the lights off
Oh you like living with that mask on
Fuck all the bullshit show me passion
Money, power, I want it all
Yea I see you like the lights off
Can't believe it took me this long
Have you forgotten where you come from
Money, power, I want it all

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
Lining up the stash spot after rushing with a sea of niggas
Bound up and gagged, shot, that's how they wanna see a nigga
Money make these niggas do some crazy shit
I've seen niggas step up and they shit blew, like they navy kicks
You are who you're involved with, be careful when you date a bitch
I done seen whole empires fall from wifing up a lazy bitch
Wifing up a shady bitch, wifing up a bitch who wanna be famous
Nobody wants to see your trash on TV
Must be on your [] Brady shit, if i'm dead, the navy hit
If i'm lying, i'm flying, swear to god i've been bred this way since '86
Jumping in and out of different vehicles
We don't get exposed, we expose, I'll send you home to God, via soul
If he a killer, shoot him and he explodes
Bury him with his Macbook, in a deep hole if he a troll
Might as well act dead if you see us if we foes
It's just like Master P said: "There they go, there they go"

[Chorus: badXchannels]
Yea I see you like the lights off
Oh you like living with that mask on
Fuck all the bullshit show me passion
Money, power, I want it all
Yea I see you like the lights off
Can't believe it took me this long
Have you forgotten where you come from
Money, power, I want it all

[Verse 3: Kxng Crooked]
No more dabbling in the dope game, tryna chase major M's
How can I operate in the shadows if i'm on stage with Em
Crime, I used to love the girl
Can't keep one foot in the industry and one in the underworld
That's how fans cage you in
I'm better with them other bars, rapping is my main event
The hustle was the undercard, niggas think they run the yard
Pulling up in them Bentleys, my connects use them as bumper cars
Nigga you ain't stunting hard unless you know where them tunnels are
Slaughter taking the title back, white or black
Try to rap around me nigga my mind'll snap like a psychopath
With an iron bat and a viking ax that'll find your rat
Liar back, give her the 12 inches just like a vinyl rack
Her vagina gets spinal tapped
I don't give a fuck, i'm from Long Beach (we raised different)
Better wear a vest on your dome piece (we aim different)
Niggas out here fucking with powder, meanwhile they mane snitching
Think about it, how you gone smell a rat, when you caine sniffin
What's the purpose, I got all of my game from the niggas that built the streets but they wasn't construction workers
And that's why being a crook is natural
Me plus the big bad ass house that equals Crooks and Castles, uh

[Chorus: badXchannels]
Yea I see you like the lights off
Oh you like living with that mask on
Fuck all the bullshit show me passion
Money, power, I want it all
Yea I see you like the lights off
Can't believe it took me this long
Have you forgotten where you come from
Money, power, I want it all
