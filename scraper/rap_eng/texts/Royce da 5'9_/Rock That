Idolize-'em, not-a-lot-of-'em
Body-by-them-there's-a-bottle by the fags, she-should-try-to-follow the man
With-the-rocks, rocky-as-Colorado standin' on top
Of them, toppin' top the opposition
I-ain't-quittin'-'til-Vishis-in-my-position
I-drop-this-apocalyptic, you-gotta-be-optimistic
I'm hot, hot, hot, hot!
Let's try this shit again! (again!)
Vishis the prince, the topic of the spit this cop nowhere near it
I'm in a win-win position (yes!)
Could send killers to knock-knock, who is it?
Hard in pot, fall by the end of the visit, no henchmen
Six shots the biscuit (blow!)
Smackin' on his back like I'm burpin' a infant (boom!)
Then nigga put up your hands, show me the real you
Put money on your head and then I'mma bill you
Take it out yo' ass in hell, I'm on a ratchet trail
And you about to see the Gat derail

[Chorus: Royce da 5’9” & Kid Vishis]
I can't feel you, I want you to rock that (shit!)
Rock that shit! Rock that shit!
Rock that shit! Rock that shit!
Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro

I can't feel you, I want you to rock that (shit!)
Rock that shit! Rock that shit!
Rock that shit! Rock that shit!
Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro

[Verse 3: Kid Vishis & Royce da 5’9”]
Yeah, Vishis and Nickel equipped with pistols
Missiles'll hit your tissue sizzle show you and stay
Like Mystikal!
Clip to whoever riddle, my mental see you and scratch
You tryna' scrap to cover up, the fact you can't rap!
I can't feel you, I want you to rock that
Glock that, pop that, shock that
Down to click two's, I'mma spit true
Dominant crew, I'm the shit, fool
Put the clip to an actor, cut
You motherfuckers up when it's action, nigga what
We don't fight rappers, we write back at ya
Black Mack (blap!) Niggas back snap backwards (ooh!)
Actors, act puss, blow 'em off the atmos
Fear niggas should fear on point like a cactus
You probably need to practice, that's it, backflip!
Word blacksmith, herb active, dope

[Chorus: Royce da 5’9” & Kid Vishis]
I can't feel you, I want you to rock that (shit!)
Rock that shit! Rock that shit!
Rock that shit! Rock that shit!
