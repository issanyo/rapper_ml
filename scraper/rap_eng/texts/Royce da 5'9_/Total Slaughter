[Bridge: Royce da 5'9"]
Total slaughter, total slaughter
I won't leave a single man alive
La-di-da-di-die, la-di-da-di-die
Let's begin killing time

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Want no part to your bars hooks or similes
So make sure the trash ain't put in my memory
Songs sound like you ain't put in no energy
I'm all time great i'll be put with the Kennedy's
Veteran savvy rookies should know
Never mind beef all about pussy and dough
You can get put in the bag like I took it to go
In the crib trophy case only took it for show
It's me steppin' on comp, they all dead corpses
Now it look like i'm wearing all red forces
Don't wanna be hearing niggas scream "i'll clinch"
Y'all already know who seen 'bout this (House Gang Whuddup!)

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9]
Thuggin' you love it, dead 'em, it's nuttin' to say
Behead him and leaving his head on public display
Holy mother of god i'm fuckin' a virgin
Mary i'm using a rubber
Yeah i'm gettin' money
High's and lows I rise and pose like Heisman trophy's
Pardon me 'cuz as I impose I O.D
All my foes and peers i've know for years
I no longer hear so y'all should call me OG
My style is squeeze and he constant meets content
So a memory of Trayvon Martin
I take a man hood from him and then I feed him the Fleece Johnson
Y'all don't want it with the HOUSE GANG!

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9]
Pick 'em up let 'em lay
Where I'm from we see a fucking dead body every day
Where I'm from we see a fucking dead body every day
Where I'm from we catch a body every day
Yeah we all about that (Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter)
Pick 'em up let 'em lay
Where I'm from we see a fucking dead body every day
Where I'm from we see a fucking dead body every day
Where I'm from we catch a body every day
Yeah we all about that (Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter)

[Verse 3: KXNG Crooked]
Everybodys on everything
Promethazine and phetamines the shit you never seen like ketamine
Niggas on bikes drug peddling
Married to the life fuck a wedding ring
I'm high as billie holiday, homes
In this modern day Rome, slaughters gotta stay on
Gimme a bottle now with chicas winning the lotto
If your women ain't willing to swallow tell your daughter stay home
I just fucked me a black girl, and a white girl at the same time up in this bitch
You ain't never fuck a black girl, and a white girl, at the same time unless the bitch mix
Flagrant, poor sportsman, in the Icabod Crane thing
That's the drop Ferrari headless horseman
I'm too drunk to stop for law enforcement fuck that!

[Chorus]
[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9]
Pick 'em up let 'em lay
Where I'm from we see a fucking dead body every day
Where I'm from we see a fucking dead body every day
Where I'm from we catch a body every day
Yeah we all about that (Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter)
Pick 'em up let 'em lay
Where I'm from we see a fucking dead body every day
Where I'm from we see a fucking dead body every day
Where I'm from we catch a body every day
Yeah we all about that (Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter, Slaughter)

[Bridge: Royce da 5'9"]
Total slaughter, total slaughter
I won't leave a single man alive
La-di-da-di-die, la-di-da-di-die
Let's begin killing time
