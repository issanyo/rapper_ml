[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9" & Ameriie]
Take me away, from all the pressures of livin' today
And save me, I feel so alone
I don't wanna live, when you appear, take my soul
Just go, I wanna come home
(Take me away, from all the pressures of livin today)
(And save me, I feel so alone)
(I don't wanna live, when you appear take my soul)
(Just go, I wanna come home)

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9" & Ameriie]
(I don't wanna live) Rather actin' or clappin'
Attackin' rap, if it happens to happens, it happens, I wanna
(Take my own life) Somethin' that goes on inside of my head
Cause I'm only alive 'til I'm dead, and
(That could be today) Keep a gun with me cocked
Come with my squad, nobody knows my number but God, and homie
(When it's your turn) Even the paradise is a heaven
The dice is a seven, you eternally burn, baby
(This is how it goes) I think you need to wake up
You only here to just take space up, your maker is your breaker
(And it's so, real) Doomed!
If you been to a funeral before you felt the Grim Reaper in the room cause
(Death comes in three's) Yes, you could only guess
Which one of you next (which one it's gon', be)
(But could it be, you?) Maybe
But you don't think about it though, 'til them wakes is replaced by daisies

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9" & Ameriie]
Take me away, from all the pressures of livin' today
And save me, I feel so alone
I don't wanna live, when you appear, take my soul
Just go, I wanna come home
(Take me away, from all the pressures of livin today)
(And save me, I feel so alone)
(I don't wanna live, when you appear take my soul)
(Just go, I wanna come home)

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9" & Ameriie]
(Sometimes I wanna cry) Askin' myself why
Is it when fake niggas collide real niggas divide, but
(It should be the other way) Dawg, I feel you
Don't let 'em get to you, I love you, and you know who you are
(And until we meet again) I just hope you choose your soldiers wisely
Cause likely the truth'll come out in the end and
(And when it's that, time) We break bread, reflect back
Chill with the Lord and wait for the next batch
(Of more hungry MCs) The new breed's climbin these trees
Signin' these deeds, y'all remind me of me, hah
(Cause this is your life) The soul is sellin'
Your whole intelligent mode is exposed to the Devil
(And when you lookin' back!) You never get your look back
Flow or hook back, it's over, yo he took that, but
(But he can take me) I'm right there
Thought I was chasin' a dream, shit I was chasin' a nightmare

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9" & Ameriie]
Take me away, from all the pressures of livin' today
And save me, I feel so alone
I don't wanna live, when you appear, take my soul
Just go, I wanna come home
(Take me away, from all the pressures of livin today)
(And save me, I feel so alone)
(I don't wanna live, when you appear take my soul)
(Just go, I wanna come home)
