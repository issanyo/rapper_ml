[Verse 1: Nolan The Ninja]
I’m from the strip where niggas 'Strapped' as if their first name was
Bokeem or Fredro, quick to let the tech blow
No need for info, know I rep the mitten proudly
It’s 48227, the shit’s embedded inside me
You know where I be, play the crib until the cash talk
Smoking sticky through the asphalt, tip them hats off, shit
Witness the reign, only twenty & change
Went from being shit to motherfuckers knowing my name
Can’t stop until I’m pushing the Range, cruising '96 and
Bumping Illmatic, mapping motions with my brother, Eric
I thought I told you that the text is esoteric
Only built for the live where I reside, no façade
I’m cut from a cloth that these niggas couldn’t sport
In this bloodsport, niggas don’t play fair, I follow suit
Don’t fuck with me then it’s fuck you, I’m blunt as can be
I’ve been a nuisance since they hung me on them nooses, it’s no excuses
A year ago, I was playing PRhyme
Now I got Nickel Nine on the line, rooting for me to shine, it’s real
Cuz now the veterens see me as brethren, fuck being pressured
Cuz I’mma snap necks when I catch wreck, let ‘em know I’m next in
(Turn up your stereo, my nigga)
You’re officially tuned in to a moolie who
Verbally paints a movie by jotting lines on a looseleaf
Poetic prophet who persistent & play the position of gifted
Extra Prolific, like them niggas from Hieroglyphics
If I said it, I meant it, I’m a fucking menace, I’m here from a minute
Clocking calisthenics, calculating my quest to conquer
Until it’s 40K at concerts, ya heard

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5’9"]
I work for every buck, murking every bust, the spread’s very plush
Canary truck burier, six friends will carry ya
Listening to David Ruffin, Mary Puff, Barry Chuck, Barry plus
I inherited nothing much but motherfuck a fairy dust
Delegate with shell and flames, Mac-11 wrapped in black & yellow tape in cellophane
Selling caine, this Heckler and Koch that I got is so well endowed
You should tell the cops that it's immaculate, it would actually still look masculine
If I dropped it on Ellen's crotch in the park while I’m knocking It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot
I got no time to be telling lies to these jealous guys
While I try to vibe to Big L and Nas, Makaveli, Ready To Die watching Belly
That shit is like my daily exercise, shots fired, check vitals, check your child
Nobody check out, might wanna check your bials
Nigga, wipe off your daughter, we bite too hard to respect your growl
Shut your mouth if you’re skeptical, not me, I’m going the extra mile
I’m at the farm, extra arm, ready to wet the cows, we could bet the house
We come to split you, the difference between writer’s block and uninspired
Some of which are against ya and; some are biased
Just understand there’s a difference between a man being hot and a man who just under fire
Damnit, just come and try us, the humble pie, the young empire, them lies told
By those jumbo liars, put them iron throws at your body, will turn your hole into size of jambalaya
The undeniable, diabolical, last of a dying molecule
I’m sicker than your average, dinosaur when it’s time to roll
When that drama close, you’ll be traumatized & be kind of froze
I call that shit trama-toast, comical, fingers round his throat
If he outspoken, see if he can rhyme what he got in his notebook
Got his nose without choking, if not, adios you marrocon
You got the baddest hoe, I got the Holly home, check your hottie, homes
Me and Nolan catching bodies while we body throw
Playing catch with zombies while we standing next to giants yelling hiddy ho
