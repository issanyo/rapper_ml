[Chorus: Mike Smith]
Today’s a new day to find the old way
That we used to be when we’re alone
It’s been so hollow and full of sorrow
We cut each other right down to the bone

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9]
Drama yeah come one come all, read bout it
Some rise and then some fall
But us fall? We doubt it
We stylin, C Tops and candy cane
Being vicious riding, side by side
Looking like the gumball three thousand
Rebound, the toast one to this life
Singing Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney
The girl’s mine to the white
And when the time is nice I tangle with my own criminal mind
I’m in the vine but I’m only getting twined when Mike
Bout to take it back to back when raptor was immaculate
I’m here cause of my acumen, flying off on a tour
Now I’m in that dirty mansion looking at a bands of bitches
Get vacuuming and I ain't talking the floor
Made my next move be my best move
And may these bitches never bounce
And may they keep coming like my cheques do
Ace all the time, order me another round
As your mind keep spinning around in this smoking lounge

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Jonathan Hay]
Bring me back in the basement, right back in time
When we loop the record, let it on and let it rhyme
The days of way back, back
The days of the track, track
The days before any record contract
Going back in the days yeah right back in time
When we loop a record, let on and let it rhyme
The days of way back, back
The days of the track, track
The days before any record contract
We going back
(Back, back back (round and round)

[Verse 3: Mitch Littlez]

Before I even kicked a verse, before i even spit a rhyme
I started playing with the words that transformed into a line
Before it was a hobby man, before it turned into my grind
Before I found my destiny, before I knew it was my time
Before all these shorty’s and all these chicks get on my dick
Before the times I had no seeds in my knicks
Before I thought of a contract, before I thought of making it out
My niggas was hustling on the corner and all the D’s were shaking it out
Before iPods and all these DVD players
We had tape cassette deck, that was before CD players
Before HD quality and all these 3D layers
Before that Samsung flat screen TV player
Before I heard Woo Tang, before I heard Biggy Smalls
Before I heard nasty lines, before they tore up the city ya’ll
I fell in love with hip-hop when I was a little niggy yo
(Back, back, back (round and round))

[Chorus]

[Outro: Pink Grenade]
I still remember our first December
St. Augustine that day’s been you and me
Although it’s hazy
We seemed like crazy
My parents basement, just you and me
Time keeps on ticking
Take a second just listen
Auditory, visionary thinking they can just keep on ticking
Time keeps on ticking
Take a second just listen
Auditory, visionary thinking they can just keep ticking
