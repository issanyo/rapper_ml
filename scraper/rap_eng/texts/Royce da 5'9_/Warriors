[Papa Roach]
It feels like we are headed for a meltdown
Im sweating as the seconds start to run out
I know that there's a glitch in the system
We're breaking down the walls of this prison

We are the warriors!!!
We are the warriors!!!
We are the warriors!!!
We are the warriors!!!

[Papa Roach]
So shine your light
Push the enemy back
When your under attack
It will protect you
Kill the night
All we need is a spark
We can bury the dark, ignite
Come on and shine your light

[Papa Roach]
We fall on in this real inferno
Illuminate our lives we are eternal
Denying in ahead a collision
We sacrifice ourselves for the mission

We are the warriors!!!
We are the warriors!!!
We are the warriors!!!
We are the warriors!!!

[Papa Roach]
So shine your light
Push the enemy back
When you're under attack
It will protect you
Kill the night
All we need is a spark
We can bury the dark, ignite
Come on and shine your light

Come on and shine your light!!!

[Royce Da 5'9]
Madness coming
Surrounds me as I'm falling
Imagine if happens to all of us
It actually a felt like a gun on me
You I know I didn't last this long
Anything less then a warrior
Average!
Savage!
Better that then
Has been a mortal

We are the warriors!!!
We are the warriors!!!
We are the warriors!!!
To the right to the left so shine your light

[Papa Roach]
So shine your light
Push the enemy back
When your under attack
It will protect you
Kill the night
All we need is a spark
We can bury the dark, ignite
Come on and shine your light

We are the warriors!!!
We are the warriors!!!
We are the warriors!!!

Come on and shine your light!!!

We are the warriors!!!
We are the warriors!!!
We are the warriors!!!

Come on and shine your light!!!
