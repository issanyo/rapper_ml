[Verse 1 : Ransom]
I think you probably figured out that I’m not your average artist
Sincerity and honesty with a splash of hardness
I tend to speak to those who appear brash and heartless
I aim for their soul and proceed to blast the target
I ease pass the garbage
But never overlooking them dollars that make sense
Cause we need cash regardless
So please pass the garnish
I decorate plates my food for thought is great
My gourmet’s like foreplay
That’s all day they tryna copy the recipe, looked at me sceptically still gave you the best of me
This is my destiny they can’t take it, my plans sacred
I gave 'em a jam and the fans praised it
Beloved I love it, everything that I covered is covered
I’m rugged and tough as putting grub in the cupboard
I’m deeper than jewels buried by ancient kings discovered
Ayatollah the controller I break the strings of puppets
