[Intro]
Slaughterhouse

[Hook: The New Royales]
Sex and drugs and dirty money
On the race to rule the world
You cut your teeth on fame and diamonds
Your time is up now, three.. two.. one
We number one

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Y-yea, yeah we them Slaughterhouse rock stars, the pitch is black
We signing every titty out, we going tit for tat
Now can you picture that? And how ironic is it
That I'm riding round listening to Nickelback (I'm back)
On appeal, I'm trying to have Rod Stewart cars
And Ozzy Osbourne motor skills
I'm trying to have a rich bitch like Paris Hilton
That like to get her ass smacked like Keri Hilson
Haha, I'm the one, who you tryna be?
Nothing to hide, the jimmy covers up my Tommy Lee
The one, I stage dive to a pot of gold
I'm empty, nothing's inside me but rock 'n' roll!

[Hook: The New Royales]
Sex and drugs and dirty money
On the race to rule the world
You cut your teeth on fame and diamonds
Your time is up now, three.. two.. one
We number one

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Crooked's got a gun
I'm reckless with lead, Zeppelin instead
Let's get a keg, let's split a mescaline that mess wit'cha head
I'm sexing a lez and her best friend in bed
I love these freak women
Somethin in my denim need a kiss, call it Gene Simmons
They wanna ban me like Marilyn Manson
For all the whores in my Baltimore, Maryland mansion
I'm the one who wants to spear Britney
Give Pink some black, put it near her kidneys (here, kitty!)
I'm the one who always cause an affair
So every time your bitch burp you smell my balls in the air, yeah

[Hook: The New Royales w/ Joe Budden ad libs]

[Joe Budden] + (Joell Ortiz)
Yeah, yeah; see I'm a on-stage rock star (backstage porn star)
Khloe on her car dash, (Kourtney on the OnStar)
Zoe Kravitz stumblin out the telly in a torn bra
(They dribble on my balls in the whip, now that's a sports car)
Dawg, you gotta see him when he drive by
(Cock-eyed) Have all the ladies going gaga
Me? I'm more mellow, so I'm lookin for a La La
(You sure? I want a whore, a Gabor, a young Zsa Zsa)
(The one, a outcast, I don't need to rock)
So I could put my love below by her speakerbox
The one (Kate Perry try and kiss my wife)
And gave me dome at Katie's home, baby this the life
