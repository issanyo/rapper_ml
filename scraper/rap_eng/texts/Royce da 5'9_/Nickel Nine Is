[Hook]
Nickel Nine is.. me not them, this is.. him not they
Royce and Reef, double R, beef is close, but trouble's far
Nickel Nine is what the rhyme is, I put my time in nigga
Nickel Nine is.. me not them, this is.. him not they

[Verse 1]
He is the reason why the funds is dizzy
Money continuously spinning, round and around like a frisbee
My lungs is sticky from, the second hand smoke
From out of the guns; he shoots a lot, they busy.. come get me
He is, quick on the draw, same nine that I used
When you thought I copped it and popped it at the same time, shit
Carry tools, you gotta, the streets is overpopulated
With niggas who cheat, like Andrew Guilota
Royce and Reef, double R, when the gutterest beats
Meet with the troubled bars, nothin but heat
Niggas I'm in and outta this booth, like Clark Kent for the youth
Flying with the NARC-proof tent for the truth
Niggas be tripping a lot, so I keep the longest clip in the lot
Hit you while you loading the clip in the Glock like bloaw!
No life, no rep, the only games I play is Umi Says like Mos Def

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
He is over-protected, keep the coldest connections
When it goes in effect the only thing froze is the necklace
That's it, keep the gat by me, I'm not rowdy
So none of you's can see me like Jack Ponti
None of you niggas bad as me
I got a Mobb and we Deep like Hav' and P, so get a job
My shoes is 9 and a half sizes too big
For every thug nigga listening and nodding his head
You better know that he is, a motherfuckin' throwback
Rap shit nowadays is so wack, I wish I could go back
Shit is undone, so I spent money like
It's more from where it came, even more where dick come from
The time it took to write this, I could be selling twice this
And wipe shit, like my vemonmous drive is priceless
My goons they'll put you away
And if it's heat, then it's no beef, homie I'll cook you today

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got niggas like "That's Eminem's man, ain't it?"
Like that's my name, like I changed it when my man became famous
By the way, you ain't beefin with Slim, you beefin with us
So stay out the magazines, keep it shh hush, okay?
This mothafuckin' rapper is hilarious, dog
Never to big for that box, cause the area's small
And you'll fit, six feet deep is where you'll sit
Bring it true, I'll turn sixteen deep into a trip to the sky

[Interlude]
Yeah, you don't wanna hover, ya mommy wouldn't like it
What up Proof? My nigga

[Hook]

[Outro]
Wall Street, my nigga X-Gov, Tre Little
