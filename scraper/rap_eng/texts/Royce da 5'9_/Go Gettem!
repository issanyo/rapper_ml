Verse One:
I pack llamas
Come at me I react Osama
You wack flow bomber
You asshole, ask your momma
Best known in the past for drama
I got Pac's persona
Topped with the mind of Barack Obama
That's me
Viva me at my leisure
I be any ?
? on my Visa
Me and my skeezer
My heat on the seat of vehicle, next to me rollin'
My neck frozen like it's supposed to be in my freezer
Rims and tires
It's Tims and higher
And nigga we don't rent we buy 'em
And that's prolly why y'all scary
Y'all dudes is punks cause y'all shoes on y'all coups and dunks
Is all cheaper than Mulberry's
On the contrary
I'm back and I'm not stoppin'
Model on the back while I'm cat walkin' a crotch rocket
We flier
Cease fire
We gonna keep ridin' till we need tires
You prolly should keep quiet
You niggas think that just because it's dope it's phony
Since I'm God sent that you really supposed to stone me
Cause I rhyme sick, that I won't put cheese up
And put out hits, on niggas faster than Interscope and Sony

Chorus:
If they throw you in the cage what you do?
Think about it
Then what?
Man up
And then what?
Get up out
And then what?
Go Gettem'! [x3]
Welcome to the Bar Exam
If he diss you in a rhyme what you do?
Let him do it
And then what?
Let him drop
And then what?
Let him flop
And then what?
Go Gettem'! [x3]
If he diss you in a rhyme what you do?

Let him do it

And then what?

Let him drop

And then what?

Let him flop

And then what?

Go Gettem'! [x3]
