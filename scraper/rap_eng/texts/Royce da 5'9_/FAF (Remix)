[Intro: Audio Stepchild]
Man I want the rest of you cowboys to know something
There is a new sheriff in town

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Give me two months, I’ll be famous as f*ck
I said that two months ago while I was smoking blunts
Now I’m getting a massage, half Brazilian broad
Ass so fat, I feel like it’s a Minaj
Hazel colored eyes, damn this chick fine
She’s feeling on me
I’m feeling the birthday cake rhyme
With my system in my cup, missionary f*ck
Backshots, hand Glocks, man I switch it up
Like the flow-go, I did it dolo, flew solo
Birdman not from no tho
No flow though, self made, self paid
ESP records, established in these streets
Through hard work, ya’ll respect it

[Chorus: Pink Grenade}
Put em up, put em up, put em up
Put it up, put it up, put it up
What’s up
Okay, bitch shut up
Eight weeks till I’m  famous, sixty days till my name
Eight weeks till I f*ck the world, sixty days till I bang
Famous as f*ck
I’m already rich as f*ck
And when I’m famous as f*ck I’m gonna rule the world

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
In Jesus name standing outside in freezing rain
Standing out in that heat out here till the seasons changed
I know what I’m supposed to do
Therefore so there is no excuse
‘been so true so I’m overdue for this ocean view
My deal is about the ability, lyrics and soul
Making money legitimately is the goal
Bout to be airing out we’ll see how it goes
Who will carry hip hop on his shoulders, it’s me I suppose
It’s me I suppose
I like to do what my time has perfect the flow
Respect we struggle before
We would just do an extra show for extra dough
No one can protect you though
No one up like that you know
You want it like quite the opposite
It’s me I suppose
But for now I’m off that vile talk you know how I do
Thank god for sidewalks cause everything ain’t meant to be street
Ain’t meant to be deep, so gotta have that balance
Even though I thrive I’ve had to have that challenge
I’m living that fortune, you can have that camera

[Verse 3: Pink Grenade]
I breathe
If I speak honestly I won’t use it more than need
I breathe
If I speak honestly I won’t use it more than need
I breathe
I’m already rich as f*ck
And when I’m famous as f*ck I’m gonna rule the world
Famous as f*ck
If I speak honestly I won’t use it more than need
I breathe
Famous as f*ck
