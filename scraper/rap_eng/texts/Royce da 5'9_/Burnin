[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Let's be honest, my dominant pursuit
To ball is phenomenal like Ndamukong Suh
I only fear tears from my son
Glass is half full, mindframe: rain is tears from the sun
Now sit back, picture pitch black
Get your 6-pack, your bitch spazzing get your dick back
You planting seeds like a lion gardener
I got money on you, but I ain't on your side
I ain't your silent partner
I give 'em the finger
Cause niggas used to cut the off switch off when I called
I done been through the ringer
Yeah, my bitch asks ''is you gon' fight
Everybody that got something bad to say about you?'' Yeah
They shouldn't run their mouth
I ain't the leader of the Slaughter
If I was we would be called Drunkenhouse
About this infinite shit, mention the clique
This clip will quickly get your attention
Nickle and Vish

[Verse 2: Kid Vishis]
Marksmen with the pencil, my pen is like a pistol
I wish you would
I sick you intending bodily harm if you trying to get your issue
I'll make your center fold, 7-6-2 full magazine
Rifle his eye, call the shit insight, get sniped
Full clip, let it rip, kiss his ass good night
Good bye cause you'll perish first
We'll put you underneath the ground
So far you won't be found 'til the meek inherit the Earth
He ain't hardcore when I grab the .44
I make 'em flip, call the shit street parkour get it?
The mag'll spit and take all the air out you quick
Which will remind you of opening up a bag of chips
Youngin the truth when it come to the *spit*
Loaded pistol flowing my guns drew
Since you a fucking fruit
You can't even chew a banana without chipping a tooth
Step in the booth and I'll chew you

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
It's so prophetic, that selfish shit it be so patethic
Cause when your whole crew ball it's all copastetic
Now tell me what could be only realer if Oprah said it?
''I'm rich, bitch, from talking on shows'' - yo, forget it
The flow kinetic, move crowds when I spit a bar
My drive's impact is more than when you it a car
Son keeps shining cause he is a star
Kick dust like the Greek mythology's minotaur
I'm in a rental car trying to avoid the struggle life
With enough shit in the trunk to do double life
I hustle right, gotta zip up the duffle tight
Like bitches fronting with Jordan I'd rather cuff a mic
But this industry is simply complex
Fuck empty concepts, I'm thinking strictly ''I'm next''
Meatcleavers and bloody aprons is Slaughterhouse
Wack rappers get a pass, next time I'mma call you out, bitch
