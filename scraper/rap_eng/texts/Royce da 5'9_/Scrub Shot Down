[Verse 1]
I will murder you, I don't want to
But I will punish you, if I have to
I don't fuck with you
Cause your vibe is wrong, and it fucks with me
I don't play games
So you never know, never never know
You won't touch a bow till I'm touchin you
If I lose control I'll start shooting you
'Till you like no no no no no
I will murder you, I don't want to
But you'll start to lose, can't escape you
Nigga we can go, we can keep it low
So everybody else don't have to know

[Chorus]
Another scrub shot down
A scrub shot down
Another scrub shot down
A scrub shot down
Another scrub shot down
A scrub shot down
Another scrub shot down
A scrub shot down
You lose, I'll do you

[Verse 2]
Take a drink (ahh)
I can't drain myself and still keep it cool
So I keep in mind do it on my own
Show up at your home, in the danger zone
How many times must I tell you before I finally got you
You fool, I'll do you
I just murdered you, cause I wanted to
Cause you had to go, that's just how I move
I won't waste no time, I will take your life
Nigga take this nine, here's the finish line

[Chorus]
Another scrub shot down
A scrub shot down
Another scrub shot down
A scrub shot down
Another scrub shot down
A scrub shot down
Another scrub shot down
A scrub shot down
You lose, I'll do you
You threw

[Outro: Royce Da 5'9" & Kid Vishis]
Yo' family gonna be like, boo hoo
I get my brother to shoot you in the face
Get yo' punk ass brother bitch, I get my daddy, at least I got one motherfucker
I ain't yo' bitch, I ain't nobodies bitch
You ain't feelin' me? Screw you
Boo hoo
Faggot, didn't I tell - didn't I tell you I was - shit
Nigga thought the song was gonna be over
Nigga probably get back in and just play the fight and shit
Man, which one of you niggas killed Santa Claus?
He wasn't the real Santa Claus, he just looked like him, man
