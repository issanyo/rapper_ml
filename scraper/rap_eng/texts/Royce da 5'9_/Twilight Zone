[Chorus]
What is competition
I guess I never know
These niggas sound like clones
I'm in the twilight zone
I'll murder every MC on your list
You can count on me to do it
Until I'm there and I'm the only one
I'm in the twilight zone to some
I'm in the twilight zone

[Verse 1]
And I'm your host for this evening, Rod Serling
I was supposed to defeat these odds early
I hope you don't think that my focus shifted with my sober shit
I'm still the coldest with the flow, I still be holding loaded clips
I just be wearing clothes that fit, financially I'm comfortable
But to the young and broke I appear old and rich
My advice is hang around me, then you might be learning some
Only problem is you niggas clowns and when I'm 'round you I stick out like Sherman Klump
Hitchhike and wearing Pee Wee Herman thumb
I'm just a bird who gets the worm and when it comes to flipping words
I'm sicker with the terms than a determined Trump
I'm here for earning till the sermon's done
Get out my ear with shit that's not my biz, chump
You will get off 'cause we don't offer tea
You will get turned to Kermit lunch
And you ain't worth the money my attorney wants

[Chorus]
What is competition
I guess I never know
These niggas sound like clones
I'm in the twilight zone
I'll murder every MC on your list
You can count on me to do it
Until I'm there and I'm the only one
I'm in the twilight zone to some
I'm in the twilight zone

[Verse 2]
Load up the choppers to go at the genre
Look out the window like brother Malcolm
But no one was out there, this how
We ride on our enemy, but naw, I ain't shot you
I just looked you in your eyes, with the nine in your mouth
Cause niggas been murdered over hip hop, B.I.G., 'Pac
You a artist them niggas died for you so now you ain't got too
Uh, for yo' hoe shit, these boys bled
They opened doors for you to hide behind decoys, feds
Hip hop, they got they own police behind these stories, yeah
You might be killed because you wearing blue and he wore red
I'd prolly be dead if I never elevated my skill
I invaded they projects in the elevator with steel
Cause they just imitations, shit, this how the truth sound
When them credits roll, your label gon' tell me you got the juice now

[Chorus]
What is competition
I guess I never know
These niggas sound like clones
I'm in the twilight zone
I'll murder every MC on your list
You can count on me to do it
Until I'm there and I'm the only one
I'm in the twilight zone to some
I'm in the twilight zone

[Verse 3]
I'm truly mesmerized by all your desperate lies and uzi threats
Your wifey sleeping on me? Cool, I seen that she needs a beauty rest
I give my man that look, that's it, he gon' see to it that you be dead
You give your man that look, that's it, y'all newlywed
The crew nice, your crew got ice, my crew ISIS, my crew beheads
Them Slaughterhouse conglomerates, them jugger[?]nauts
The thug anomaly hugging on nines and be loving your mama not
When drama pop we never on the opposite side of a homicide
Never, everybody knows us, the murderous
Joe, Joell, 5'9" and Crook, hide your rhyming book
We been around a long time, that's how much time it took
And if I could move mountains why would I care how to climb it, look

[Chorus]
What is competition
I guess I never know
These niggas sound like clones
I'm in the twilight zone
I'll murder every MC on your list
You can count on me to do it
Until I'm there and I'm the only one
I'm in the twilight zone to some
I'm in the twilight zone
