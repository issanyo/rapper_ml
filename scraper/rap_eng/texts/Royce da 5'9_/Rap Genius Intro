[Jay Z]
This poetry is thought-provoking and there's thought behind it
And there's great writing in rap as well **Static**
You know you never hear **Static**
Rappers being compared for like the greatest writers of all time
You know you hear Bob Dylan it was, so was Biggie Smalls
You know some of the things that Biggie Wrote

[Sample: Notorious B.I.G. - "The What"]
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan

[Jay Z]
Rakim, I mean listen to some of the things he wrote

[Sample: Eric B. & Rakim's "Don't Sweat the Technique"]
Classical too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never irrelevant: mathematical

[Jay Z]
I mean you take those lyrics and you pull 'em away from the music
And you put 'em up on the wall somewhere
And someone had to look at 'em
They would say "this is genius!" Static
"This is genius work!"
