[Intro]
Greg, Ryan, take the damn garbage outside
808 Mafia

[Verse 1]
Summertime were the funnest times
Momma used to had to say come inside like a hunnid times
Flat booty, big titty bitches just on they grind
My nigga Moody used to say they was built like the number nine
Hah, wish I could be childish for old times
Either y'all were Tranzor Z or y'all were Voltron
Stole bikes with Ike until the time that he stole mine
Told mom, she told me, "What comes 'round goes 'round"

[Chorus]
Stop, right (Right there)
I never said that life, was fair (Fair)

[Verse 2]
Look, we had our best times when momma and papa went out
And someone like my auntie would watch us
She just smoked weed and want not to be bothered
We go and leave the house to not be by her
She was our favorite, she never would holler
She get high and give out several dollars
Every time she get the camera, she'd tell me to smile
Knowin' damn well I was never no smiler

[Chorus]
Stop, right (Right there)
I never said that life, was fair (Fair)

[Interlude]
"Hey girl, how you doing?
Yeah, Greg's in there getting dressed, how are the children?
I see you got you a new car
You know I'm just gettin' along, gettin' along
Ryan is doin' well, uh, girl I gotta go Greg is callin' me
It was good talkin' to you baby
I can't stand that bitch, ugh"

[Chorus]
I said stop, right (Right there)
I never said that life, was fair (Fair)

[Verse 3]
Look, same girl that Momma just was talkin' all fake to
Used to borrow our papers, and all of our things
She was always ungrateful, always had bad news
Always into the latest gossip
Always was tryna show our father her nudes, that shit not cool
One day we went out in town and they broke the door down
On our house and stole all of our food
Stole from us, we ain't have much more than you

[Outro]
Stop, uh
Stop right there
You know when karma catch you
Everything in your life goin' fail
You gon' be a failure
You gon' be a failure
Said you gon' be a failure
You gon' be a failure
We gotta move
