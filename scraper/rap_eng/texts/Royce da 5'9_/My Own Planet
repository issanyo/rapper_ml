[Intro: Royce da 5’9”]
Right off the rip, nobody could fuck with me
I’m out of space, mind and body, my soul and so on
Mami I’m fly is an understatement, come to greatness

[Chorus: Mr. Porter]
I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back, for doing good
I don’t need nobody else, I’m gon' do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it’s all good

[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9”]
Right off the rip, nobody is quite like me
You gon' need a NASA spacecraft to sight me
If you don’t like me, bite me
I could give a fuck, less fighting excites me
Leaning on the moon with a patron fifth
Playing my own shit, and I sound terrific
I’m not cocky, I’m beyond that
It’s time to start another hobby, I’m beyond rap
Run and tell your baby daddy and your son Ray
I’m hot, I sunbathe on the sun, bae
I’m the one on the one way
Hands and pretty long legs from the runway
My nigga Nauny is a genius
You gon' need a ladder just to climb on my penis
Got two words for the rap game, fuck y'all

[Chorus: Mr. Porter]
I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back, for doing good
I don’t need nobody else, I’m gon' do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it’s all good

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
Right off the rip, you thought it was a wrap for me
Didn’t you? Go ahead and admit it hater
Cold as ice, I’m a living refrigerator
The reason hip hop’s breathing the defibrillator
I did a bid just for drunk driving
It’ll never happen again 'cause now I’m drunk flying
I’m an innovator, when I say I’m on Venus
I don’t mean that I’m dating the tennis player
I’m on Saturn where you don’t matter
Alone, I’m past the zone where your phone scatters
Hello? Can you hear me now?
You don’t got a fucking choice
I elbowed my way into everybody’s conversations
With rhyming, timing and patience, now I’m in space, bitch
I used to have to be on some "watch what I say" shit
But now you gotta take it

[Chorus: Mr. Porter]
I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back, for doing good
I don’t need nobody else, I’m gon' do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it’s all good

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
They say a closed mouth don’t get fed
I say a closed mouth don’t give head
On the flip side, know a closed fist don’t get bread
And if you swing it then you gon’ get lead
Boy I put ‘em in a panic, got ‘em all frantic
Overlook my antics, you’ll see that I’m a throwback
Hip hop Stan Smith, but it lessen my love
'Cause the so-called rulers ain't quite measuring up
Now let me give the chicks a message
Bitter exes'll tell you that the dick is precious
Three words, get over it
And if you speak mine, mention I could trip over it
Low key like my name too big for the bill
Betty White style, get it in, still
Plus I’m on the high you can’t fit in the pill
But I try anyway, we gon’ die anyway, ya heard

[Chorus: Mr. Porter]
I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing
Then turn around and pat myself on the back, for doing good
I don’t need nobody else, I’m gon' do it by myself
Say what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it’s all good
