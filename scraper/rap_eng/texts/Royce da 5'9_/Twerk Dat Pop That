[Chorus: Trick Trick]
Get this paper (twerk dat, pop that)
Work that shaker (twerk dat, pop that)
Go ahead baby (twerk-twerk dat, pop that)
Turn around lady (twerk dat, pop that)
Everything on us now (twerk dat, pop that)
Turn down for what now (twerk-twerk dat, pop that)
Bag it up, turn around now (twerk dat, pop that)
Let me see you drop it down now (twerk-twerk, twerk dat, pop that)

[Verse 1: Trick Trick]
Who said gangstas don't do that? Cause they lying
In the back of the pussy club, it's all mine
Getting drenched by the cheese, spend 'em rain and shine
They head to another one, can't decline
What up to the DJ, straight to the back
Ten racks to the waitress, change for all that
Twenty something years old, ass so fat
Them boys in the club, D hats all black
Tops coming off, ass on the floor
Guess ten ain't enough, so I gotta get more
They'll lose their mind if I head to the door
They don't love me, they love the bread I blow
God damn, got em on they hands and they knees
Scratching after scratch like rats for the cheese
I'm a dog, I even got scratch for the fleas
Touch my money you could touch your knees

[Chorus: Trick Trick]
Get this paper (twerk dat, pop that)
Work that shaker (twerk dat, pop that)
Go ahead baby (twerk-twerk dat, pop that)
Turn around lady (twerk dat, pop that)
Everything on us now (twerk dat, pop that)
Turn down for what now (twerk-twerk dat, pop that)
Bag it up, turn around now (twerk dat, pop that)
Let me see you drop it down now (twerk-twerk, twerk dat, pop that)

[Bridge: Royce Da 5'9"]
I got a white girl (I got a white girl)
She's a dancer (It's Tricky!)
She do whatever I say, no matter what I ask her
Her action's the answer (Talk to)
Of course she know I got a black girl
Who's also a dancer
Don't talk about your life, don't wanna hear about your bottles and ice
Cause we got Marshall out the house tonight
Stay awake

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I’m in VIP with no ID with a pint of Beam
Lightin' cheeba, wylin’ the fuck out like Bieber at nineteen
Or Ice-T in the 90s
Frightening in some Nikes slut, nice D’s
There a slight breeze? Don’t like me? Well then bite me
There might be a better chance of flight 370 turning up than us, bitch (highly unlikely)
Little dyke think ‘cause I’m Libra - you're Pisces, and you’re feisty
That you're like me and you might find that we’re like minded
We ain’t nothing alike Diva, you like sleeves
I'm a wife beater you white tease
Bet you like skiing though right skeez?
The way you’re balancing yourself on the poles
Why don’t you grab this one and Do The Right Thing like Spike Lee?
And look out like you’re sightseeing and invite me in the back and bite me in the (God damn)
Shake that ass and titties Cassidy felt that
Dick so fat it could practically snap her chastity belt strap
Standing all the way back where my hotels at
She actually fell back and landed in someone else lap
And laughed cuz she thought she sat on Pharrell’s hat
(Twerk dat, pop that)

[Chorus: Trick Trick]
Get this paper (twerk dat, pop that)
Work that shaker (twerk dat, pop that)
Go ahead baby (twerk-twerk dat, pop that)
Turn around lady (twerk dat, pop that)
Everything on us now (twerk dat, pop that)
Turn down for what now (twerk-twerk dat, pop that)
Bag it up, turn around now (twerk dat, pop that)
Let me see you drop it down now (twerk-twerk, twerk dat, pop that)

[Verse 3: Trick Trick]
Fresh out of damn near everything I had
Lil homie, just grabbed the whole damn bag
I could spend all year, never blow my stacks
Getting white boy wasted, hold my mac
Back to the spot, roll some up
So blown last night I toked some up
Lookers want anything, ain't got enough
In the club without bra's ready to get fucked
They drinking, smoking, touching, rubbing
Rolling, crowd's in love with my thugging
Lick it, taste it, kiss it, suck it
Shit! Tryna see who want fucking
Drop that thong, grab that pole
Bend it over, let me see what I can do with that (OH!)
Stack so big it ain't never gonna fold
All the money I spend, you ain't never gonna close

[Chorus: Trick Trick]

Everything on us now (twerk dat, pop that)
Turn down for what now (twerk-twerk dat, pop that)
Bag it up, turn around now (twerk dat, pop that)
