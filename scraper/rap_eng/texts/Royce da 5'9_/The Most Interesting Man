[Intro: Will Lyman]
Whoo... Kid!
His charm is so contagious
Vaccines have been created for it
Years ago, he built a city out of blocks
Today, over six-hundred-thousand people live and work there
He is the only man to ever ace a Rorschach test
Every time he goes for a swim, dolphins appear
Alien abductors have asked him to probe them! [Vincent Price laughs]
If he were to give you directions, you'd never get lost!
And you'd arrive at least 5 minutes early
His legend precedes him the way lightning precedes thunder
He is... The Most Interesting Man in the World. [kids ovation]

[Interlude: Royce da 5'9"]
B-E-3, GO!

[Verse One: Royce da 5'9"]
International rapper flow
The leader of the rat pack who’s back for more
Backpack packed that’s equipped with gats and more
Artillery than what I had before
Plastic explosive flow, act a ass
Leave shit stains on the game after I pass
Whoa, gotta get it, sickness, your ho, got it, get it
All I really need is one nine, na-nine, na-NOT!
You are about to get into the mind of a psycho
Malcolm, looking out of the window with a rifle
Other hand on the bible
Cut a nigga face up, make a muhfuckin' nigga look tribal
If he got a trigger then he prolly [probably] gonna pull it
Til' he runs out, prolly won't sweat it, cuz' he got
Eeny meeny miney mo bullets!
I hit the roof, do number two, Hex Murda this one's for you
You too, Guru, wake up, this one's for you
Hold up (AHHH!) [Wilhelm scream]

[Interlude: Royce das 5'9"]
Hit a nigga with the Jay-Z hold up, "Hol'up!"
Take a drink for my niggas
You lil' fruit (Haha) [Vincent Prince laugh]
That's right, I'ma bring it from the soul, nigga
B-E-3, GO!

[Verse Two: Royce da 5'9"]
Only competition's the chronic gun
Going simmalimma tillamimma simmalimma tillamimma
It's supersonic! (uh!) It takes one to know one, a killer
Gunshot (gunshot) gunshot (gunshot)
One, next thing you know, no one's iller
Po po fill ya up, piss on your chinchilla
Fuck you and your tight pants (AHHH!) and that dance
I admit, I attack fans
Twitter beef's the shit, finna plead the fifth
Standing in front of a hung jury with one worry
Uh, and a bitch ain't that
Patron, Patron, come on, come on
Drink 'til I talk to the bottle
Royce da 5 all spent out
With the 9 at the end, follows! (Damn!)

[Outro: Royce da 5'9"]
Ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to the Bar Exam 3
Fuck you very much
We got Eli Porter on the guitar
Play it, Eli, play it! Bring it from the soul
We got Tay Zonday on the keys
Play it, Tay! Bring it from the soul
Let Eli play something on the keys
Eli, play something on the keys
[piano keys clunking] That's right
We gonna bring it from the soul, Ricky Bobby
Whoo Kid! [DJ Whoo Kid]
