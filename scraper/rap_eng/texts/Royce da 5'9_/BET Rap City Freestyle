[Intro: Big Tigger]
Yeah
Rap City
The basement
Marlo, 5'9"
My man Royce up in here
It goes down like this
Okay
Check it out now

[Verse 1: Big Tigger]
Let me run it line for line
It's Big Tigger, Basement booth, Royce Da 5'9"
Come too close, I'm closing the curtain
Tomorrow, pick the album up, Death Is Certain
Yes indeed, you know how we be
Holding it down, off the top, Basement booth on BET
I used to be out rapping on JLB
With my whole fam in the D repping the 313
Okay, this is never written down
Today, tomorrow, it's all never spitting now, hey
My man, Big Tigger for sho'
'Bout to give it to you with that uncut raw
Now Royce, 5'9" is up next to flow
And he's about to come through and close down the show

[Pre-Verse: Royce Da 5'9" & Big Tigger]
Yeah, yeah
(Tomorrow, go cop that)
Aiight
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
This tool that I use on all of your peeps
I call it my heat cause I use it when I lose my cool
It's too risky to collide
With who's sitting on the side of your new whip with a huge pistol
The huge clip, thinking out of the bottom
The size of out of a bottom's clip
Every goon you got will be hit
Reduce the size of your clique
Like poof, like I am a magician
I'm a giant to you, trick, I'm bigger than you
Feel like a pool stick in a room full of toothpicks
Don't compare none of these rap wannabe cats to me
The best fear me, the rest is dead money
Now that I'm back on the scene
It's back to your baby mommas chasing me, I'm back on TV, yeah buddy
Come get me cause we ain't scared
Catch a buck fifty the size of Freeway's beard, yeah
Ain't no need to [?] the vest protecting the K
From ripping through bricks and hitting the rest of your henchmen
Never been in the penitentiary, never get tense
When it's war, I never worry about catching a sentence
I don't care if you're strong especially since my weapon is long enough to bury you with whatever you're benching
I ain't friendly, I don't talk for nobody
Who ain't cutting a check unless you're a dentist
You can never attempt to diss me
If you do, I will censor the lead of your pencil
You punks better be distant
One punch will leave you lumped and
Dumber than Jessica Simpson
Holla

[Outro: Big Tigger]
Aiight then?
Cop the album, stop playing, aye!
