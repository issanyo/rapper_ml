[Intro]
We in here...12 o'clock in Pasadena
Thinkin' back on my past demeanor
We came from fish snacks nick knacks and a bag between us (TRUE!)
When Cash is needed, I got $15 he got $5 to me we got twenty
That's plenty, when the plan is to dodge the reaper
Shit half the time don't even know where we sleepin'
But I am my brothers keeper
And you can't borrow money off of Jesus (TRUE!)
So I laced them boot straps, got my ass up
I ain't ever goin' back
Never gone slack
Never off track
Never gone slide...
Never hide. never slip
Never cry never

[Verse 1]
Never content, never surren-der, you reminisce I remember
The niggas I'm wit I'm around they’re pushin' them keys all about like a Fender Rhodes, Ro, Rose Gold winnin' but keepin' a low pro
Really we killin' it silly degenerates grippin' the game in a choke hold
Old soul, listened to Luther when poppa was pushin' a Volvo
Laughin' all the way, to the bank, what niggas think, this ain't no joke
No hope, niggas a product of Reaganenomics they slavin' for dollars
Ain't goin' to college when niggas out here, stealin' ya shit and holdin' it hostage
Showin' a profit, here's an excuse, for kids to get loose like a made man
Nobody I know, fuckin' wit Pablo when I say dude is s Ye fan
Them cartier them wood frames my hood gang got checks to get
My testament from front to back to up & down reads excellent
You hesitant, we all in aww man dog we saw bands
Caught hands fought and lost friends come with me this God's plan
You all bad, all this get all that just fall back
These raw raps all facts keep me standing out like all caps what you call that?

[Hook: JMSN]
We ain’t all defined by the choices we make, (yeah)
So I ain’t going to waste my time thinking bout yesterday, (yeah)
Why don’t you tell me what you want from me
If you want it, know I got it, and that’s all its gon' be
Yeah that’s all its gon' be x 2
If you want it, know I got it, and that’s all its gon' be (yeah)
(Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whooooa)
Yeah that’s all its gone be x 2
(Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whooooa)
Yeah that’s all its gone be x 2

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9]
Nickle
I'm a legend in the making
Bask in the presence of the greatness
Last of the heavensent, fresh as peppermint
Never give cash to the reverend
You can never call a nigga hasbeen
Who been everywhere you niggas never been
I survived through every trend
Bleed through every mic, died through every pen
Apologized to God through every sin
I coulda just got left like Larry Flynt
If dis my death it is very grim
Coulda just got buried instead I got married
Now there's no summer I don't slow tongue her like a cherry stem
Nigga I stay current like a scary swim
Cause I stay stern
Congregation know I stay determined to provide they sermon
The Pistons had Chauncey Billups
I was looking at Andre Drummond
Now my community gated, I ain't worried about
The ones who don't announce they coming
Cause now I rebuke the haters
All i'm trying to say is how dare you stop me from doing thee Iman Sumpert to Teyana Taylor
Used to have to put patches on my high tops
Used to have to Kwame it
A nigga had negatives, but my positives just gon' have to outweigh it
Nigga i'm just happy I made it

[Hook: JMSN]
We ain’t all defined by the choices we make, (yeah)
So I ain’t going to waste my time thinking bout yesterday, (yeah)
Why don’t you tell me what you want from me
If you want it, know I got it, and that’s all its gon' be
Yeah that’s all its gon' be x 2
If you want it, know I got it, and that’s all its gon' be (yeah)
(Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whooooa)
Yeah that’s all its gone be x 2
(Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whooooa)
Yeah that’s all its gone be x 2
