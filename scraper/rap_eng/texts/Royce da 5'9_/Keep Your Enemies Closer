[Verse 1: Lucas Asher]
We got distribution, Beijing, Belize
We got distribution in the air and seas
We got drivers waiting in our vans
Blueprint’s dry we don’t show you our plans
We got bail bondsmen on payroll
We read Machiavelli, Arthur Rimbaud
And I’m moving closer to my enemies
Want to sleep and breathe the air that they breathe

[Chorus: Lucas Asher]
I’m in my enemies homes
I wear my enemies clothes
Be formless
Like air and water
Power is unknown

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Nickle
I said I started out trusting people way too quickly
Life on the edge living too dangerously
Now it ain’t no mystery
That no weapon shall prosper that’s been formed or aimed against me
I keep my grass cut, low to protect isles, from rodents and reptiles
We throw them projectiles, throw dirt on my name tearing Down my identity instead of friends
I know the whereabouts of my enemies
I’ll be keeping them close to me so eventually hopefully I can say that I found peace mentally, socially
Who gon’ still be there when all of the drinks are gone?
None of them who were there when all the drinks were flowing
You got a rider, a roller, just know a coward is colder
That Patrón was something I definitely was powerless over
So I got me a lawyer, and I got me a shrink
No other out there's like me, my kind probably extinct
But guess what?

[Chorus: Lucas Asher]
I’m in my enemies homes
I wear my enemies clothes
Be formless
Like air and water
Power is unknown
