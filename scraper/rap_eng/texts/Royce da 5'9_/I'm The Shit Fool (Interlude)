[Verse]
Mac shooter, you should not act like you Suge
I'll abuse ya, make the past your future
The gat clean niggas up fast, it's like we pack loofahs
I blow a nigga top off him if he acts ruthless
Go ahead, act stupid
The gun be talking like "Blatt! Hey, how are you doing?"
It's like Rasputia
I'm past G, gats blow like Apaches
Stretch a nigga out like the asshole of Raz B
Blu, you my boy, you my boy, Blu
I'm a fucking alcoholic nigga, I'll destroy you
I'm the shit fool, I'm a part of the I'm-The-Shit crew
I don't give a fuck if you got your momma with you
I'll split you, gun long as my homie's, talk
But when I see you, you better skate like Tony Hawk
Your dogs only bark, run up on me mark
I paint the wall with your ass, it's only art
Felonious homies is with me nigga, don't excite us
Fuck around and get stole on like Winona Ryder
Bitch, shut your motherfucking piehole
Before I put you in a paper black and white like a Mulatto
Drunker than fuck like where the bottle
Having a threesome with a pair of models
My fleet's like Aristotle
Onassis, throw rock n' roll party whole bashes
Coke sniffing and smoking hash, don't get your ass kicked
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh
My crew got more green than mashes
Cremate a nigga and bust a nut on his ashes
I'm the shit fool
May I repeat that, I come through and cease that
I come where you sleep at, I come to your doorstep
Equipped with the instrument like forceps
Ya niggas feminine like a corset
I'm too good to be all corporate, I'm a sure bet
I got more horses in the hood than a Corvette
I'm hot, when I walk, I can make the floor sweat
Young nigga, still I'm a vet like Tony Dorsett
I'm the shit fool!
