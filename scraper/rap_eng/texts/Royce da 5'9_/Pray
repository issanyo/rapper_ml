[Intro]
(Let us pray)
Dear Heavenly Father, thank You for watching over us today. I pray for the sick and [shut in] and for those who have lost loved ones. Lord, I pray for the homeless. Lord, I pray for our soldiers and their families. I pray for everyone here today...

[Verse 1]
God taketh away, and God giveth
The clock's tickin' away as the plot thickens today
Cause I'm sippin' hard liquor
We couldn't suffer the same amount of losses
Cause my supply's bigger
Don't associate me with nothin' but that dopest child star shit
That Lindsey Lo', that Todd Bridges
Hit your block with a tickin' bomb that'll
Leave the competition in hospital
I'm the product of foolish pride
I'm a speeding bullet who responds to the pull of God's trigger
Jumpin' out the barrel, like "Excuse me, Nas. Move aside, Jigga"
I'm hard as proving ground bricks
Groundbreaking each time I spit words and they hit the street
You don't like the game, you can google my dick, bitch

[Chorus]
And that goes to everybody
I pray for foes, I pray for hoes
I pray for everybody
But you can pray for them
If you gon' pray for somebody, pray for them

[Verse 2]
Don't pray for me, pray for Paris
Pray for Nigeria, pray for peace
Pray for your marriage
Pray your horse don't sway far away from your carriage
Why you put all of your eggs in one basket?
Blowin' dumb cash on Wraiths and karats
Your daughter ain't an heiress, I hope she's taken care of
More importantly, I hope this gun in your face don't end up in your mouth
I'll make you taste the terror of the kickback of this gat that could break the barrel
More court cases, hate betrayal
If I approach thee, boy, please take me serious
Cause if I say that I shall, then I shall proceed
I don't cry wolf cause I don't enjoy wasting tears any more than I enjoy wasting shells
I looked at the state of my health and asked the reverend 'bout it
I didn't just pray for myself, I prayed for everybody

[Chorus]
But you can pray for them
They need you more than me, pray for them
Pray for everybody

[Bridge]
Look around, look around, look around, look around
Pray for everybody, tell me exactly what you're seeing
I'm seeing children being murdered by police and then acquitted on all charges
It's like they're all targets, pray for them
Pray for everybody

[Verse 3]
Live from the gutter, my father's a drugger
The block is my mother, 2Pac got it on lock in my suburb
I got dope double-wrapped up in bubble wrap on top of my cupboard
Old ladies watching from shutters
Tellin' all the children keep watching out for us
Bad influences, we the gumbo that you see inside the pot
Swimming 'round in all the saddest, truest shit
Addict in the coolest whip
Riding 'round my city lookin' for the baddest newest bitch
Hammer in my stash, feeling too legit
90 on the dash, slammin' on the gas
Passenger mad, saying that the break pedal do exist
I'm saying "I'm late man, I got school to skip"
Introduce me to your chick, I turn this shit to a Skip to My Lou assist
I don't talk too much shit, I discuss shit by throwing hands
I'm a sucker for hoes in yoga pants
Tell my queen I'm in this shit, like kissing and holding hands
I keep my flings on the other end of a string with swollen glands
I'm a player, I've been to every hotel and every lobby
Every time I pray, I send up a prayer for everybody

[Chorus]
Don't pray for me, nigga
Pray for them
You gon' pray for somebody?
Pray for them

[Verse 4]
Don't pray for me, pray for respect
Pray to get something different from rich and away from your debt
Nigga, I'm straight to cassette
Y'all digital, y'all about as physical as finger under some balls, coughin' while taking a test
Too many artists get mistaken with best
Cause they on the charts, you sleepin' on me, I'll come and wake you to death
While I pray against all the violence and shootin'
ISIS got Obama sittin' down with Vladimir Putin
I saw a child online ask his father "Why did they do this?"
His father then replied to him, "We gotta fight 'em with flowers growing out the ground"
I look at violence the same way I look at slavery
It's never ending in light of abolishment
These are my finest hours, then
I pray for everybody

[Bridge]
Look around, look around, look around, look around
Pray for everybody, tell me exactly what you're seeing
I'm seeing children being murdered by police and then acquitted on all charges
It's like they're all targets, pray for them

[Outro]
(Let us pray)
Lord, please keep Your arms around us, and protect us from harm and danger. In your son Jesus' name, amen. (Amen!)
