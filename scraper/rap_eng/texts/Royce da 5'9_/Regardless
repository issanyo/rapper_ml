[Verse 1]
My arms are heavy, knees weak, palms are sweaty
Niggas wanna see me gone already
From this song on it's on, you about to be swept away
Yesterday is long gone
I took some time to redefine my style
I kept my cool, sun was behind the clouds
You lames can't put me in the same category as a rookie
Nope, my name ain't new
Rappers can't push me as high as I can
Push myself, you not inspiring
The stolen spot is open, I chose to not listen
And I don't even know what's hot or who dissin'
Or who's consistent or who's nice or not
Who's on top or whose wife is sniffin'
Or who's meltin' soon to be failin'
All I know is the way the streets felt 'bout "Boom"

[Chorus]
Regardless, nigga pump yo brakes
Ya car is movin' fast, we will lump your face
Regardless, me and Cash will come
And take yo ass away far, nigga don't play
Regardless, the M-I-C
We kickin' ass and takin' names, you can't ID
Regardless, me and Tre is comin'
Out to play wit you today, it's curtains

[Verse 2]
D-Elite! We comin' with the lighting and thunder
Under the rain, to pump it you need a jeep!
You need at least some speakers while ya glued to ya seat
From cruisin', while I creep through ya system
I'm gon' be heard as God is my word
Deliverin' the kind of murder, KOCH don't deserve
The real will cop it
Every label in the world look out for me, I will kill yo roster
I will shut this shit down
And on top of that I could fuck yo bitch now
It's hard to believe that Columbia couldn't market me
To do numbers like D12 at least!
I played myself for radio play
I never dance, but the skill itself is a second chance
I'm back with tools by me, start the beef
I'm 'bout to part these streets like "Bruce Almighty"

[Chorus]
Regardless, nigga pump yo brakes
Ya car is movin' fast, we will lump your face
Regardless, me and Cash will come
And take yo ass away far, nigga don't play
Regardless, the M-I-C
We kickin' ass and takin names, you can't ID
Regardless, me and Tre is comin'
Out to play wit you today, it's curtains
