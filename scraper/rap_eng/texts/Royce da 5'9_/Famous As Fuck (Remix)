[Sample]
...And I want the rest of you cowboys to know something, there's a new sheriff in town

[Intro]
Famous as fuck in two months, Pink Grenade will be the biggest act out, fact, two months

[Pre-Hook]
Look bitches, I’m already rich as fuck
And when I’m famous as fuck
I’m gonna rule the fuckin’ world

[Hook] (x2)
I worked hard for this, fought and fuckin’ bled for this
Carried through and broke myself in half for thi
Crashed through every door that shut, oh
Give me two months and I’ll be famous as fuck, oh

[Verse 1] (x2)
Put ‘em up, put ‘em up, put ‘em up
Put it up, put it up, put it up
What’s up? Okay, bitch shut up
Eight weeks ‘til I’m famous
Sixty days ‘til my name
Eight weeks ‘til I fuck the world
Sixty days ‘til I bang

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5’9]
(Get money) In Jesus name, standing outside the freezing rain
Standing out in that heat, out there ‘til the seasons change
I know what I’m supposed to do, so therefore there is no excuse
I’ve been so true, I’m so overdue for this ocean view (Get money)
My city’s about the ability, lyrics and soul
Making my money legitimately is the goal
‘Bout to be airing it out where it need to be aired, we’ll see how it goes
Who gon’ carry hip hop on they shoulders? It’s me I suppose
It’s me I suppose, all I can do with my time is perfect the flow
Respect the struggle before we just show up at your show for extra dough
No one can protect the dough, don’t want it like that you know
You want it like quite the opposite, you want it like x and o with me I suppose
But for now I’m off that violent talk ‘cause y’all know what I do (Get money)
Thank God for sidewalks ‘cause everything ain’t meant to be street
Every rhyme ain’t meant to be deep, gotta have that balance
Far as me, in order to thrive, I had to have that challenge
But now I’m living with the fortune and fame
But you can have that camera

[Bridge]
This is what I have to be, what I broke myself in half to be
I’m in it for the music, if with it comes fame, then let it be
I don’t plan to be anybody but me and if I can speak honestly
I want music more than the air I breathe
If I can speak honestly, I want music more than the air I breathe
And if I can speak honestly, I want music more than the air I breathe

[Pre-Hook]

[Outro]
And if I can speak honestly, I want music more than the air I breathe
Famous as fuck, muthafucka
