[Intro]
Yeah
Absolut, you're blowing up, nigga
This your nigga Royce Da 5'9"
Y'all know I've been doing this shit
Holla at me
5'9", yeah

[Verse]
I've been a criminal back before I was rapping
Back before you was getting fucked for your ASCAP
Back when Busta was wearing them big ass hats
Back when Jigga was twisting, when 50 was fat
Way back when niggas was macking sitting in lax pimp
I was packing the gorilla lifting them gats
Arm of the law, your whole army can all
Be found hard in the cold closet, the morgue office
You probably Hollywood hard, you lie
You get pulled out of the armored car you're driving
Look at your crew
I should slap your mommas for having the kind of pussies that pushed you through
Go back to the hood you good, the oki-doke section
Where that smoke that he blows effective
My flow's a lesson, truth is told
With extra truth, each song's a whole infection
He knows that each one of your soldiers testing
Didn't see the sign that reads the smoke you section
On my back, right behind the sign on my front
That reads your momma conceives the pumpkin seed
A bitch who would be getting bitten in to by nigga
Who want your seed to do anything to get to it
A hungry flow from the streets [?] back
From the future, gun shoot 'til you spun back
I'ma show y'all old niggas how I go back
Make rhymes that make time slow or go back
Come on holmes, the MC'ing
You're not even on my block, so hip-hop is about to be on my back
Nigga, come out of your throne, I'm coming for your hat
If I see a crown on you, I'm on you
From now on, is now how I hunt
