[Intro]
Eat what you kill
And that's the truth until the cemetery

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
I've got caveman tendencies, Niggas club, I club niggas
I get clumsy when I slip into a zone, I'm a blood spiller
I grew up to grub on, the grub of other niggas
My demeanor's hyena hiding in this dog eat dog world
Waiting for the day you murder prey
I'll come through in a convertible
To murder the murderers with gloves on
And treat it like it's a big feast and pick my teeth with a vertebrae
Even though I planned to be back, I don't plan to leave behind a bone
I rhyme with no apathy My mind's stuck on
Beef and bon apetit I don't have to get deep I ride alone
Survival of the fittest in this new era Contra war zone
I’m in a fitted with my blueberry Encore 4s on
I’m trying to stomp a fucking thug long
Enough to make my shoes ugly
Enough for me to walk out of there
Lookin like I got a pair of smudged orange Lugz on
Married to the streets but the love gone
Up north in a car clean
Sitting somewhere with a Harley
Looking like a art scene
How I'm cut as my gut feeling tells me you cut wrong
If you got heartstrings
I got a bow and arrow going through mine
Like the one that Chuck Norris tugs on
He feelin froggy, either he can leap or sip some tea
I'm gripping heat that's how it's gonna get handled
Even if you mugged wrong don't underestimate the range of my greatness
Blazing all night Play your cards right
Might want to bring all your aces
I got an angel on my shoulder who's telling me
What the hell are you doing
While the devil's going to fuck what he saying into Jason
Because of Jay Z, I got pistols with beans
I call them bleekays with lazers
You try to faze me Your face will be looking like Enrique Iglesias
If yesterday i borrowed from him, Tomorrow I'll repay him with patience
And my apartment might remind you of Martin
All you see is the Tommy, Bruhh man, Me, Pam, and cases
I'm trapped with my feet lounged up, Beside a feline
It sucks that y'all cats is just
Fucked beyond being a peon
It's probably because he riding in the neon
And I'm in the SL, I'm SLP, and he von dutch
My wood fragrances giving these bitches pussy favors
With the electricity of ions inspired by Elon Musk
He told me he's afraid to talk, When I said "speak what you feel"
And that's exactly how I keep it, Eat what you kill

[Hook]
Eat, What You, Kill
Eat what you kill
And that's the truth until the cemetery

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Rap with wolf spirit, All the crooks feel it
Heart of lion though, I ain’t lying ho, Violent rhino
Angry hippopotamus, Crocodile smile, swim in lakes that are bottomless
Swam cruddy waters,  jam muddy waters
Reefer and champagne, Played at the end game
End of my campaign, I'm a champion
See the belt, ho, Know I was felt ho
We the Pistons in the 8, 9, and 9-0
Bad boy, bad boy, Like Shyne Po
Its 85 and I'm the Benz in the Chicago
All that fuck shit you talking is embargoed
Where yo refrigerator [?] heavy Chevy
It's necessary that I triumph over adversaries
Then take the spoils of war and share it with my military
Eat what you kill and that's the truth until the cemetery

[Outro]
