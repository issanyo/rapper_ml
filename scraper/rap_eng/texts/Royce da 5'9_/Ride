[Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, yeah, I'mma every day walk my dogs
Like a motherfuckin gangsta; gun toaster, slash pranksta
In the 7 on Dalvins with Cash, we be mashin
To the club seein who gon' hurl who the fastest
Bitches sippin bubbly and drinkin thug passion
Niggas get them lil' pistols shoved in they asses
This hundred-and-one round drum take up half the
Trunk so punk, we gon' tear up this club faster
Detroit niggas only get along with who belong
And if you get on then we can use you
From 7 and Woodward to 7 and Telly - the West side
Where niggas with 'Cardis, weapons in Pelle's - yes ma
From 7 and Woodward to 7 and Kelly - the East side
It's murder; from Kelly and further
East where peace signs and street signs is unheard of
You can either collide with me or ride with me

In the D every day is violent, it's never silent

Bein broke got tirin - so how I'm s'posed to eat?

Crack be flippin, you will never catch me slippin
Watch out or get stuck for your jacket

A dude chopped his wife up with a hatchet (damn)
You might live to see eighteen
She got raped, he gagged her mouth, so she can't scream

Meanwhile I'm in the skyloft, stretchin the coke

Hold yo' head in this piranha tank, bitch let 'em gnaw on your face
Pussy ass niggas lie in they bars
