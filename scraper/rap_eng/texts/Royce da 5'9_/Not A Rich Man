[Hook]
I've been called down so many names
But nobody ever called me a rich man
My ex-girlfriend was a love of my dreams
And she left me for a rich man

[Bridge]
Everything seems out of my reach
Like I'm falling in quicksand
I know in my mind I'm a king
But I probably won't die a rich man

[Verse 1]
Feeling like I carry the worlds weight on my shoulder
Momma always told me these days will make me a soldier
I keep my friends close, I keep my enemies closer
The music is giving me youth, but the stress is making me older
Sometimes I want to give it all up and just take the pain away
We dust in the wind and I feel myself slowly fade away
All I ever get with this heart is breaks and these 808s
Lord give me a sign I'm just tryna make it from day to day
My sneakers worn down, no soul in em
I need the kind of money with the fold in em
Man these pockets ain't got no dough in em
Feeling worthless as a penny with a hole in it

[Hook]
I've been called down so many things
But nobody ever called me a rich man
My ex-girlfriend was a love of my dreams
And she left me for a rich man

[Bridge]
Everything seems out of my reach
It`s like I'm knee-deep in quicksand
I know in my mind I'm a king
But I probably won't die a rich man

[Verse 2]
Staring at this bottle of liquor
I drink it quicker and quicker
If I don't get the picture
I'ma be a goner
Who said money can't buy you happiness?
I'd rather be crying in a C-Class than crying on the corner
Cause my sneakers worn down, no soul in em
I need the kind of money with the fold in em
Man these pockets ain't got no dough in em
Feeling worthless as a penny with a hole in it

[Hook]
I've been called down so many things
But nobody ever called me a rich man
My ex-girlfriend was a love of my dreams
And she left me for a rich man

[Bridge]
Everything seems out of my reach
Like I`m knee-deep in quicksand
I know in my mind I'm a king
But I probably won't die a rich man

[Bridge (Royce da 5'9")]
I said I crawl that bad quicksand, than I became a rich man
(say I probably want die a rich man)
I said fuck the fame, I'm 'bout knowledge itself, health and rich, man
(say I probably won't die a rich man)
I'm a law-fearer and...

[Verse 3 (Royce da 5'9")]
All seeing I who didn't involved in a God's hearing
All hearing money involve the thoughtless car stealing
Crime dodging and walking pallbearers, with them boxes
Before I go back to drinking, I'd rather take shots through the spine
I`m here to make my careers outta reach
Here to make and here to be straight poppin of nothin
I`m literally straight poppin this outta the clip
Que-pasa? Exposing your boys, but think they pay mobsters
Those are your boys who not shoot as they got hose and shirts
Cause they are boxers
I`m planning to die rich with my head in the hands of a black chick
Ready to die and already made wedding plans with God`s bitch
You, niggas, deal with petty mans` logic, not me
I deal with hefty cans or bags filled with 70 grand of dollars

[Hook]
I've been called down so many names
But nobody ever called me a rich man
My ex-girlfriend was a love of my dreams
And she left me for a rich man

[Bridge]
Everything seems out of my reach
Like I`m knee-deep in quicksand
I know in my mind I'm a king
But I probably won't die a rich man

[Outro]
I said I probably won`t die a rich man
I probably won`t die a rich man
I probably won`t die a rich man
I probably won`t die a rich man
