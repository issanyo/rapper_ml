[Spoken Word]
The Book of Ryan
The untold tale of scandal
All my bars of madness
That are inspired by my childhood, scars and sadness
Every black man must fend for himself
Where we value physical much more than we do our mental health
And what the fuck you know about coming back from hitting rock bottom in life?
Nigga all I want is a good home, and a wife
And some children, and some food to feed 'em every night
Where's my parallel to that?
Nigga, where's my parallel to that?
Where's my parallel, to that?
