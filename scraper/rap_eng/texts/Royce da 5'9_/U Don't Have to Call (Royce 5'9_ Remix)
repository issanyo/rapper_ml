[Intro - Usher]
Yo.... after tonight
Don't leave your girl 'round me
True playa for real, ask my nigga Pharrell

[Verse 1 - Royce Da 5'9"]
Detroit Rock City ballin, Philly batters and Boston
It don't matter where we at, we travelin often
It don't matter what we pack, the gat'll be coughin'
That'll be that, either that or your faculty's softin'
Ladies stack that, ass phat when they walkin'
Gallopin like horses, Jesus, I just wanna get in between ya
Like, chilly when you thinkin of me
But really you leavin Dallas, Austin, it's happenin often
I really could read you, rather by payment to please
To spoon feed, really who needs you
The longer I get, the longer I please you
Five Nine'll creep wit the people, keepin it diesel
But who could forget you, I'm keepin it street
While I'm shootin this missle, reachin and heat seekin this freaks
Royce 5'9" is literally the head nigga that's breathin
The reason that chivalry is dead, so please

[Usher]
Situations will arise, in our lives
But you got to be smart about it
Celebrations, with the guys, I sacrificed
Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
Meanwhile I, I, I, I, I... I loved you, you were my girl
You see I, I, I, I, I... thought the world of you
But your so steady still leavin' baby

[Chorus - Usher]
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight

[Verse 2 - Usher]
Aw girl your face is, sayin' why
Tears in eyes, should've been more smart about it
Should've cherished me, listenin' to friends, now it's the end
And again no story can end without it
Damn ri..i, i, i, ight... I loved U, you were my girl
U see I, I, I, I, I... thought the world of you
But you're so steady still leavin' baby

[Chorus - Usher]
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight

[Bridge - Usher]
Gonna boogie... tonight
Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy
To stay home, waitin' for love
So tonight, I'm gonna do what a single man does
And that's party!!!

[Chorus - Usher] w/ (ad-libs)
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight

[Bridge - Usher]
I'm alri-ight-ight
Gonna boogie.. tonight
Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy
To stay home, waitin' for love
So tonight, I'm gonna do what a single man does...
And that's party!!!

[Chorus - Usher] w/ (ad-libs)
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
