[Intro: Royce Da 5'9"]
"He murdered sometimes months apart, years apart
He used different methods
He would go so far as to plan in his crime the actual deceit of law enforcement
He would murder someone
Cut their body, wrap them in layer after layer of plastic bags and material
Then deposit the body many, many miles from the murder scene."
I'm a lyrical hitman
I'm a lyrical hitman

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
This the homicide, sodomy of course
Mobb Deep, like I got Havoc and Prodigy support
Ima' be dope until they find me as a corpse
You can roll your weed up in my Toxicology Report
You can call me Kuklinsky, Iceman for short
And I got dead rapper's pens in my Icebox
After they act hard I lyrically kill 'em then I bury their notebooks in my backyard
Check it out, the lead gonna hit 'em
I'm so far from positive
Nigga I'm the opposite of Rev Run on Twitter
I'm a dead wrong, headstrong spitter
Compared to me you a faggot gettin' fed bone nigga
I'm pitch black!
You a red bone nigga, I'm a trip
You're headphone on, I'm sick
You a snitch, that like to sing the Fed's songs, nigga?
Oops, I forgot my meds, you the absent minded
When they find ya' body it's gonna be without ya' head

[Hook]
"A mind made for murder"
"Expected the man to uh die, but..."
*I'm a Lyrical Hitman* x2
"It really surprised me it would've took his head off"
"That's something I didn't expect"
*I'm a Lyrical Hitman* x2
"Richard Kuklinski"

[Verse 2: Marv Won]
This city is murder for hire
Got word to my supplier
Snuck up on 'em
Strangled 'em, he never heard the wire
These niggas claim they cold, I swear my words are fire
Me and you can get it on, I bet that you retire
I'm from the city of Gators, YDI
Cold men, he own guns, this is not A Country for Old Men
Boat Guns, sweat socks, don't run, just stop
Put the needle in his big ego, watch his head pop
You little niggas done fizzled out
Niggas claim they murderers
Ima' show them what this about
I am doing work, you can't travel here, pick a different route
Gimme twenty beats and I pick 'em off as you pick 'em out
My shit is the screen, I'm clicking this heat
I hit up your peeps, whip up ya' beef
Duck, spray 'em
I'm a stuntman by the way I lift ya' Jeep
They should throw under the jail for how I'm killin' this beat

[Outro]
"Is one of the most dangerous criminals we have ever come across in the state
He murdered by guns, he murdered by strangulation, he murdered by putting poison on victims food
He did all of this, the same time while still exhibiting a normal placid family existence."
