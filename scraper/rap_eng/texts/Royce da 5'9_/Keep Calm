[Intro: Kuniva]
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Kuniva]
You carry a strap in yo' pocket, I'll put 'em in your face
Ammo by the boxes, homie, you can catch a case
Draw the line on cowards in the words, "You'll get erased"
Public housin' the bitch niggas, put 'em in they place
When did you slang gats? My dawg, who claimed that?
The way I'm slappin' niggas up, you think that Proof came back
I'm from that murderous, run in yo' avenue, cop a choppa
Learn how to work on myself 'cause hood reppin' don't come with manuals
Blaze cats as gangsta as gangsta gets, gangsta shit
Laughin' all the way to the bank with this, shank a bitch
You don't wanna see the weaponry that I'm mainly with
Fuck you in the set that you came here with
I'm D12, Frank Nitti, females chasin' me
Fast ball with a slight curve, niggas can't hit me
Shady for life, got a problem, you pay with yo' life
If I okay it, by tonight they'd be sprayin' you

[Chorus: Kuniva]
We don't keep calm nigga, we bound to spaz
And roll up on your Nissan, better throw up a peace sign, nigga
You know it's all Shady, so we side with the fam
Together we ride, shine, even die with the fam
Get away 'fore they spray, when it's cops, bam
The price you pay for tryna bark at the man
I ain't playin' when I say that we ain't playin'
Real niggas all day from the late night to the AM

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, I am preposterous, I hit you 'til you fall unconscious
Long arms make y'alls look small
Like you tryna reach the jaw of an ostrich
I make y'all dogs play leapfrog with a rhinoceros
I nickname your broad Molly Ringwald in a moshpit
I got the syllable thing down to a science
What's a noun to a giant? Lookin' down on the nonsense
So what's a word to a wordsmith?
Only word that exists to me at the present time is the word "gift"
Though you won't remember what you saw
Nickel Copperfield, magician
The pistol with penny for your thoughts
You can't take the heat, get out the kitchen
And get ya' cabbage cooked
And put on the platter with a rabbit's foot
You got a gun, you might've found the wrong utensil
Go and get you a notebook and a Ticonderoga pencil
And write this down while you tryna body verses
That Nickel got them out-of-body verses, brrrp!

[Chorus: Kuniva]
We don't keep calm nigga, we bound to spaz
And roll up on your Nissan, better throw up a peace sign, nigga
You know it's all Shady, so we side with the fam
Together we ride, shine, even die with the fam
Get away 'fore they spray, when it's cops, bam
The price you pay for tryna bark at the man
I ain't playin' when I say that we ain't playin'
Real niggas all day from the late night to the AM

[Verse 3: Kid Vishis]
Yeah, yeah, smokin' that candy kush, she say that's daddy Bush
I'm gettin' frolic but my pockets got that fatty look
You lack that manly push, I want yo' white girl
So I'ma shoot kids up in her and get Sandy Hook-ed
The Illuminati's in the room with a shotty
That probably shoot 'til you'll die out your human body, boom
Nobody move, I've come to eat your soul
Gun in right hand, Iceman, you lay up with my finger rolled
Teach y'all, who the reaper of the beats are
We are, all you niggas is retards, I see flaws
When I say I'll give 'em headshots, no need to be paused
Cut and dry, you gonna fuckin' die when the beat's on
What would you do with a beast?
Throwin' them deuces in the streets
Would you compete?
It would be an abomination for combination
Bomb your congregation, so when you say I'm number two
And I'm fake, like Usain, this shit is mine for the takin'

[Chorus: Kuniva]
We don't keep calm nigga, we bound to spaz
And roll up on your Nissan, better throw up a peace sign, nigga
You know it's all Shady, so we side with the fam
Together we ride, shine, even die with the fam
Get away 'fore they spray, when it's cops, bam
The price you pay for tryna bark at the man
I ain't playin' when I say that we ain't playin'
Real niggas all day from the late night to the AM
