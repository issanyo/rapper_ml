[Hook]
Boy, I done warned you
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
Better listen up close nigga, don't trip
Your heat's in the car, mine's in this bitch

[Verse 1]
I pull up clean, manners of a gentleman
Trigger man, etiquette, one felony away from a predicate
That Patron's my medicine, them stones glowing
Like they owned by Edison, I am on my better than
Everybody tip, walk up in the club make
Everybody strip, everybody get...the fuck down
This a brrp, stick up
But I don't want no money, I want your...liquor
I'm a homicidal maniac, I know
Clip full of hollows, models, swallow, gobble
Smoke mad lala, stretch you out
So bad, you'll be able to kiss your own ass, bye-bye

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
What the fuck do you mean
That I can't fuck bitch? Fuck this, I've been dope, flashy
But I don't mean my money, I mean I'm nude under a trench coat
I put the wreck in reckless, the 'sult in insult
When you fuck bitches, they be like, "Uh!"
When I fuck bitches, they be like, "Ahhhh!"
I'm a fucking rapist, atheist, say yes, say no
KO, ayo, I'm a piranha, my pen is in the condom
And you are the vagina, your flow is and ah, kinda
So you can blow my anaconda
Treacherous methods, respect my grammar (?)
Oh, I made you look
Insane sixteens and crazy hooks
I will fuck up, prostitute raw for I fall
Follow me like I'm Allahu Akbar (Rock star!)

[Hook]

[Bridge: Mr. Porter]
You wanna see where the stars is at?
We over here, where the bottles at?
You want a problem, I'm all for that
Cause you won't make it to the car for that

[Interlude]
You are now dealing with the biggest criminal in the world
Welcome to Gotham City, it's a Dark Knight

[Verse 3]
What the fuck do you mean, that I ain't in shape? Go bag Nelly
I go and get me a fat bitch, we gon' slap bellies
I keep a box of rubbers, cock, I got ya covered
That's right, I talk to my cock often like, "Cock, they love ya"
Ha-ha, I walk the block with a oven but not your mother's
I'm talking 'bout the other, by the way, your mother
I'm terrific, I'm the president, I'm Obama-rific
Make up my own words, I'm the shitidic

[Hook]
