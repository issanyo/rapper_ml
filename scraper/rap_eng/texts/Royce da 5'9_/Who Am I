[Verse 1]
I could strike physically or mentally or
I exist in you, I'm with you give your senses a call
I have no sense of humor, I vent, you must
Stay the fuck out of my way, I'm too much
I'm the first to let you know if something is real
I come right before the humph or the squeal, I'm something you feel
Go ahead, try to fight with me nigga, do the best that you do
I could be hard, I could be soft, I'll even let you choose
I exist upon the impact of a flying fist
Always show up unannounced on you nigga, I'm kinda sick
What that nigga shoot that gun at me for?
You still alive, I'm a riot not numb anymore nigga now die
I command fear, so be afraid, be very afraid
If you get carried away, then I'mma see you
Nigga you better keep the heater with you, I'm waiting for you, dog
Cause there's somebody that wanna see me with you
Keep an attitude, I'm evil, spiteful
Stay mad at you mothafuckin' practical people
Trust the one you love and I'mma make you cry
You even try to fight drugs and I'mma take it's side
The only thing that stronger than me is time
And yours is limited, and I'm involved in it 'til you all finished
I despise you, that's why I surprise you
Even if your mother dies I'mma fucking remind you
I want you walking in front of a truck or a car
Cause I hangs out at these hospitals like a club or a bar
If you afraid, be, cause I'm so hard
Only one who can stop me is your God that made me
So, he is your witness, I am your sickness
I got every human being alive on my hit list
I'm still in your way, I'm still under your skin
You don't want me but you would give me away? Fuck you!
Niggas better know that I'm something they'll never know
All you'll ever know is that hurt in his name

[Chorus]
Nigga I'm pain, (I'm comin' for you)
You know that I will hurt you
You know I'll rise to hurt you, and you know I'll be back soon
Nigga I'm pain, yeah, I hope you like the name (I'm comin' for you)
No need to fight the pain, cause he will strike again

Nigga I'm pain, (I'm comin' for you)
You know that I will hurt you
You know I'll rise to hurt you, and you know I'll be back soon
Nigga I'm pain, yeah, I hope you like the name (I'm comin' for you)
No need to fight the pain, cause he will strike again
