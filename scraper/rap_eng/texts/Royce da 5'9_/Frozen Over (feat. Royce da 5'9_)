[Intro]

Sometimes… it seems like we’re stuck in our past
This endless cycle
Other times, Seems like we’re just trying to freeze the moment
Just for a little longer
Of all the things we control you know
Time isn’t one of them
We’re always in a race against time

[Verse 1]

When I started this I never thought I
Could be the person I became my
Own worst critic, when I was word smithin’
There was work in it, There was a way I
Thought that I could be something
Now it’s the way I stay alive
Used to dream bout Shady Records
Never could of reckoned being with 5’9”
This day and night, getting colder
My flow getcha’ like frostbite
People say what they want to say
But this all heart that’s no lie
Had a friend that went suicide
Dried the bottle
Proceeded to seizure
Eyes wide foaming at the mouth
I was in the room yellin’ don’t die
When the body went cold I realized
Ain’t gonna take shit for granted
What I’ve been through
Showed me times against you
Karma hits you double handed
I’m praying this works the way I planned it, taking a gambit, taking my chances
I’ll freeze the clock before the sands of time have vanished

[Chorus]

Frozen Over
This Worlds Been Frozen Over
From the Dreams that Never Change
The Memories Remain and Hold Us
And It’s Strange We’re Growing Older
When We Were Young, Remember it Was
Slower, Stop the watch until the seconds show up
Frozen Over

The World’s Been Frozen Over” (x3)
This World’s Been Frozen Over (x3)

[Verse 2]

I, shifted my focus to shine, hoping I don’t hopelessly grind
Momma told me to open my mind and everything will be alright
And I hope she’s right, I’ma just keep writin’
Made a few jokes in the past about 50 Tyson
Ended up with a kid who’s autistic, this here’s priceless
But this is life shit
They say that you can’t take, none of the money you make
With you, but will he still go up to heaven, with his vices
If so, I probably go, Bottle and All, Momma and All, Vomit and All
Standing and Dominant Tall
Feeling like Problems and Drama Resolved
Like a weight off my shoulders
Got the soul of 84 soldiers, put together before the vultures, integrated the culture
That was way before the, the Oprahs, the Costa Nostras, The clothing
The world before then has been Frozen Over
Sometimes it’s better to just, forget it and just, let it exist
And get rid of all your competitiveness
But me I’m just ghetto I guess
I’m taking that bottle to battle
I’m getting my daddy up out of that post office
Even if it kills me, if it means, to follow my shadow
….Frozen Over

[Chorus 2]


[Verse 3]

I wanted to freeze the hands of time
Fearing my chances passing by
Already 20, next thing I’ll be 30
I’m worried of being way past my prime
Have to rhyme, I put it up on my honor like a Samurai
Strategize to win the fight, It’s like we can’t put the past behind
Looking for power we’ll never be satisfied
This is the battle cry
What’s your alibi, some killing for rap, some killing for Palestine
Some things they never change
I wonder why it’s stayed the same
The worlds been Frozen Over
Never left the Ice Age

[Chorus 3]
