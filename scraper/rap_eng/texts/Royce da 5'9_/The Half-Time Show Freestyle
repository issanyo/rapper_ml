[Verse 1: Eminem]
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstanding
Any man planning to battle will get snatched out of his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standing
I'm headed for hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
"Bill Clinton, hit this and you better inhale"
Cause any emcee that chooses to go against me
Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky
Came home in a frenzy, pushing a ten-speed
Screaming at Aunt Peg
With three spokes sticking out of my pant leg
Eff a headache, give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain
And you should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowing you wack
You act up and I'm throwing you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwing you back up 'em
If they don't like the track, fuck 'em
The rap struck 'em harder than getting hit by a Mack truck
And then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper that trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'm a climb the Empire State Building
Get to the last step and still have half left

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Pompous, roll with monsters and dons for accomplices
Cock non-fiction concepts constant
Bomb threat and I ain't even on yet
On spec, I spit thunder and you ain't even seen the storm yet
Lightning in the clouds, start a fight in the crowd
Hyper and loud, get this mic in your bowels, biting my style
Attack all of y'all, react on the thought of y'all
Slaughter y'all, I'm calling y'all, in fact, I'm blackballing y'all
More official than an ordered pistol aimed toward rappers
Blame fame for it, shrapnel bits tore the tissue
Burying the [?] under the gravel
Saw off the pump handle and barrel for carrying convenience
My odyssey carries the [?], compare me to Phoenix
Solid and hard and light up a star, I got to be Venus
Huddle and bomb back, take cover and all that
And try to not die, you not rugged enough
You just shook as soon as I step foot in this rap game
I'm a bubble on contact like peroxide, I'm touching a cut
You stuck in my raps, [?]
Y'all sucking my ass, boosting my confidence a buck and a half
I know the game, I'm a train trapped inside a name
And whoever they taught me, yo, we ride the same
I shoot crews with the truth and chew lies of change
Speeding on a dragon in an attempt to collide with fame

[Verse 3: Eminem]
This 9 is lifting you six feet when I spray rounds
Hit you with six shots in mid-air and four more on the way down
As eight strays graze through a kid's hair on the playground
You lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now)
No pun intended, just hop out of this whip
And leave it unattended 'fore I whip out this gun and end it
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes in one minute
Cause I can leave your Infinit' full of those even if someone's in it
Snatch the airbag, hit the corner and park it
Corner the market, I got her tied up in a chair and gagged
Bitches get slapped and grabbed by the hair and dragged
Like cavewomen while I'm gravedigging with Marilyn Mans'

[Verse 4: Royce da 5'9"]
You get laced by the gun in case you try to run
Hatred on my face by the ton, get baked by the sun
Constructed of interplanetary rock and metal
Topping levels of combustion that's hot enough to stop the devil
Innovative thrust that a enemy
The impact'll be the generated destructive energy to flatten trees
Black boy since birth, burst and tore the womb up
To hit the earth like a asteroid and blow the moon up
Trust me, I'm the epitome, you better bust me
Anybody can say, "Eff [me]", and he gon' touch me
Smoking organic ganja inside of a stanza
Me and my man cypher with cans of volcanic lava
Man, and it's hot, I'm out of my head
From the bottom
I can leap out a bottomless pit and land at the top
Raw, that's what I came out here for
To raise an eclipse and occasional trips to the beer store
Switch up the breed of emcee and stick a chick up
Vigorous speed to reach in the sea and pick a fish up
I'm fly against all laws of gravitation
I done crushed all ya'll, now you want a collaboration
But eff that, you stepped up, so I'm a eff your rep up
And tear the rest up with every joint that I press up
So stop violence or violence'll stop you
Got crews iller than anybody on your block do
I roll with a white boy that pop 'shrooms
Listen to rock tunes and jump in a costume and rob you

[Verse 5: Eminem]
What a wonderful day, I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
"Hi, Ren√©e, I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway and drive away
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS?"
Blood dripping from it
Ripping your stomach up from the waist up
You talk a lot of ish, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Waging wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source
Demon is here, I'm steaming this year
I rip Mystikal's voice box out and scream in his ear
It's not a gimmick, trick, it's an image, I live it
Give a what? I don't know what a "what" is to give it

[Verse 6: Royce da 5'9"]
I grab your throat and squeeze it until it's swollen
Then exceed it until it explodes over your shoulders
Pick up your urn with ashes in it and piss in it
Diss intended to verge like a hearse with a witch in it
No more do I battle emcees for fun
Now it's guns and niggas should run from the [?]
It's barely vivid you witness rare exhibits of terrorism
Through Israel and the art when even they're dark and dismal
I'm a deranged breed, shoot me
I'll catch a bullet in my teeth
And spit it right back at you at the same speed
I'll injure if I'm offending you, we can go to blows
Even my interview should be a Hip-Hop Quotable
You can have the title, that's for brothers that's cocky
I'll take the belt with diamonds in it like Ted DiBiase
I'm rebelling your chains, in fact, you wack
I'm telling you the plane still spelling your name in your raps
You're soft-hearted, I'll say, "Let's take it to the streets"
You'll start pleading with me before we can get the walk started
I'm a deranged breed, so don't try to touch this
5'9", I told you I don't know the chorus

[Verse 7: Eminem]
Forget a chorus, my metaphors are so complicated
It takes six minutes to get applause
And by the time you all catch on, I'm a end your career
And walk away with the floor, so you have nothing to fall back on
I'll throw you out of ten floors
Pull a freaking headache out of my head and put it in yours
I'm indoors, waiting for this acid to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores
This trick wanted to blow me, I said, "It ought to happen"
"You swallow nut, girl?" "No, but I brought a napkin"
Getting skully while I'm autographing
Got my daughter laughing
Cause I sent her mother white water rafting
I'm not a fact, I'm a proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocking my U-Haul
Screaming, "You ain't moving here"
"Lorena Bobbitt, come here, want a souvenir?
I've been high as "L" since I was a juven-eer
Juvenile? Same difference, I need some 'caine
Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up to seven slain infants
Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'
