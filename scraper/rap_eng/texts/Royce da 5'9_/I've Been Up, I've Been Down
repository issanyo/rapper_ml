[Verse 1]
Somebody very dear to me just attempted to kill herself
And showed me we don’t fear death, we fear fear itself
Ever since '98 in hip hop my presence been felt
Couple dollars, couple models, couple of bitch niggas under my belt
Thorough nigga, I'mma hold you to it
If we hand shake my plan B is to complete plan A
Grindin been my strategy like this is my anatomy
I should get a tat on me that say why, why, why
Would you let some dollar dictate your army
I brush my shoulders up, polish off
Haters if you play me I’ll spray your potato layed up with fakers
I put them in the news in a major paper
My roller coaster of a career, hope it’s been real for you
Because it’s been weird for me, I feel like

[Hook]
They can take away the cars, they can take away the cash
But I bet you they can’t take the realness that's in me
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck, yeah
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck, yeah
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck
They can take away the cars, they can take away the cash
But I bet you they can’t take the realness that's in me

[Verse 2]
I just want mama to be happy
Is that too mothafucking much to ask?
Damn it I’m about to cry in this bitch, king of the jungle
I hate liars but I fuck with a lioness bitch
If you don’t straighten your ass out right now
I will find you and iron you bitch
Grindin been my strategy like this is my anatomy
I should get a tat on me that say why, why, why
Would you let losses make you act like a faggot?
I’m a fly and you act like a maggot
Money comes money goes, I used to wear funny clothes
Hammer pants, my mama used to wipe my runny nose
My real family all I care about is her, I’m feelin' like

[Hook]
They can take away the cars, they can take away the cash
But I bet you they can’t take the realness that's in me
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck, yeah
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck, yeah
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck
They can take away the cars, they can take away the cash
But I bet you they can’t take the realness that's in me

[Verse 3]
Then I watch my daddy hit my mama, listen to my mama
Tryna calm us, y'all don’t understand the problem that we have
Who gives a shit about dollars when you gotta go visit your father in rehab
You said Rick Ryan Marcus as long as I’m getting high your mama will be sad
And only I can fix this so I'mma turn this all around I promise
As we sat he said i’m down in life right now you know I'mma be back
And when he got back home it’s like it was heaven sent
Cause I was only 11 at the time and he's been clean and sober ever since
He gave me this advice, you at a huge advantage
Long as you know what’s rules in life and a view for the planet
Rather you the man than you the mechanic people treat money like oxygen
When they got it they take it for granted but then lose it and panic
So spoken G, I look at him like Superman
And y'all little niggas ain’t even close to me so if he can fall, so can we

[Hook]
They can take away the cars, they can take away the cash
But I bet you they can’t take the realness that's in me
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck, yeah
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck, yeah
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I don’t give a fuck
They can take away the cars, they can take away the cash
But I bet you they can’t take the realness that's in me
