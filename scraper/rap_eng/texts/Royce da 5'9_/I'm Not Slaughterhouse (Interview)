[Ms. Drama]
So did you give OJ th-the lyrics to say in that particular song?

[Saigon]
For his song? No, he wrote his own lyrics. But...I'm not...

[Ms. Drama]
Did he give you lyrics to say?

[Saigon]
No, but at the same time it's like, and we just havin' fun with it
I'm not gonna, go, try to be super scientifical, lyrical, mira-
I'm not Slaught-I'm not a part of Slaughterhouse

[Ms. Drama]
So do you co-sign Slaughterhouse too?

[Saigon]
Oh, well, most of 'em. (haha)
Strictly I even co-sign Joe Budden like (okay)...
He's just a faggot. He's a fuckin' faggot
But...he can rap, knowhatI'msayin'? The rest of like...
Joell's my NIGGA. He not gonna just start something (So how...)
He's not gonna just say, "Damn, I need attention
So let me just pick on somebody for attention."

[Ms. Drama]
And they're very close though

[Saigon]
They are close

[Ms. Drama]
But ho-how do you think they all get each other's back?

[Saigon]
I don't know. I don't know how they close
I-I couldn't be close with a nigga like that (That's all...)
Yeah, I'm a fan of Joell (Okay)
I'm a fan of Crooked I and I'm a great fan of Royce
And you know...I think they can rap
But I just don't think these motherfuckers can make records youknowwhatI'msayin'?
I don't think there's one song on there that we gonna be singin' two years from now
