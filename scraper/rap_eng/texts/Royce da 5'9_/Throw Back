[Chorus: Royce da 5’9” & (Ingrid Smalls)]
(R) You niggas can hold that (O) 'cause I am a throwback (Y)
I'm spillin' these cold raps, 'cause I am a soldier (C)
You shoulda been told that (E) 'cause I am a throwback
I'm spillin' these cold raps, you feelin' the soldier
You niggas could hold that, 'cause I am a throwback (5)
(Whoever wanna get it, then you can come and get it)
I'm spillin' these cold raps (9) you feelin' the soldier
('Cause I'mma bring it up, and give it to whoever want it)
'Cause you niggas could hold that, 'cause I am a throwback
(But if you wanna get it, then you can come and get it)
I'm spillin' these cold raps, I am a soldier, aah, we gone

[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9”]
Rap's wolf is back to attack hooks
Is back to slap snares and clap at the track's foot (yeah)
I'm too vicious for him, too vicious for you
And my kitchen is huge, we do dishes with dudes
Coldest flow of the summer, I see 'em come and they go
See 'em fumble the flow, it's more goers then comers
Put the piece to ya dome, then you at piece with the chrome
Peel your cap and eat you, and pick my teeth with ya bones
I'm from the city of Gators, haters I dealt with them dudes
If you don't like me then likely I'll make a belt with ya shoes
Put a hole in ya soul, it trickles badder than good
Flow is sold, before any nickle bag in your hood
I'm not a hip hop nigga, don't confuse me with them
Truest at the beginnin', and truer when the studio end
I'm just sellin' my game for cheddar forever
My intelligent brain is clever when spellin' my name

[Chorus: Royce da 5’9” & (Ingrid Smalls)]
(R) You niggas can hold that (O) 'cause I am a throwback (Y)

You niggas could hold that, 'cause I am a throwback (5)

('Cause I'mma bring it up, and give it to whoever want it)
'Cause you niggas could hold that, 'cause I am a throwback
(But if you wanna get it, then you can come and get it)
I'm spillin' these cold raps, I am a soldier, aah, we gone

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
I'm back to call the advantage, have you [?] bananas
Enhanced rep, rap grand theft auto mechanic
I'm 'bout to tighten my plugs, 'bout to be fightin' in clubs
Your blood might give me love, and likely highten my buzz
Your type is simply a bitch, and fightin' with me's a risk
I might empty my clip, if the hype will get me my niche
I'm out in front of ya, guns out
'Bout to knock ya fronts out, boxin' about to drop without Columbia
I spit this venom myself, my independence is felt
Finished with Slim and his help, long as he winnin' I'm good
Long as I'm known as one of the most vicious
MCs spittin' from the "D", low and behold the mitten
This is how I rose you bitches, Rock City chosen niggas
We stole this on a road to riches
I'll show you the golden picture, globe locked
Product is fizz, I'm soda pop like Hova, Pac, and Big

[Chorus: Royce da 5’9” & (Ingrid Smalls)]
(R) You niggas can hold that (O) 'cause I am a throwback (Y)

'Cause you niggas could hold that, 'cause I am a throwback

I'm spillin' these cold raps, I am a soldier, aah, we gone

[Verse 3: Royce da 5’9”]
I go beyond bootleggers, they slow me down, but hey
I'm holdin' my ground, long as the stolen sound should play
Five nine is a winner, I speak to keep the progression
My views take you to school, my piece'll teach you a lesson
Never been deep in the streets, I can't be somethin' I'm not
Test me and get to know me, I'll put you inside of a box
Chalked and signin' off and put ya hands on me now
Later they lay on ya chest, crossed inside a coffin
The .30 caliber shot, who wanna take on
Where they give you wounds, you goons couldn't put a stake on
All them ho ass niggas could do is cry with your children and pray
If I was a civilian for a day
I'd take a glance at my daddy ‒ another me
Raise my hand on the stand like Shaggy - "It wasn't me" (yeah)
I will melt you, smell the aroma of a coma
I'm comin' to get you, I will help you spell!

[Chorus: Royce da 5’9” & (Ingrid Smalls)]
(R) You niggas can hold that (O) 'cause I am a throwback (Y)

You niggas could hold that, 'cause I am a throwback (5)

I'm spillin' these cold raps (9) you feelin' the soldier
('Cause I'mma bring it up, and give it to whoever want it)
'Cause you niggas could hold that, 'cause I am a throwback
(But if you wanna get it, then you can come and get it)
I'm spillin' these cold raps, I am a soldier, aah, we gone

[Outro: Royce da 5’9”]
Yeah it's on, my name is Royce 5’9”
My nigga Ty Fyffe, we gone
