"Biatch!"
"For you! For, for you! For-for you! For you!" - "Fresh!" {*repeat 3X*}

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Nickel! Of course it's I
The four ship come as no surprise
I'm loffin' my chauffeur drive
He married to the streets, he 'bout to divorce his bride
Now throw 'em up! Like you praying to the porcelain god
Joey!

[Joe Budden]
I understand why dudes would wanna off me (why?)
It's small beef, goldfish to Jaws' teeth
Knick game, next to Spike, got the floor seats (talk to 'em)
Expired tin plate but the Porsche speeds
Home to wall-to-wall marble in the floor see, Nickel!

[Royce Da 5'9"] + (Joe Budden)
Spittin at your eulogy
All you rhyme about is shine and jewelry
You should change your name from MC to Tomfoolery
This is new to me and I will mop a nigga ass UP!
Do him like clean-up
(Or split him down the middle, we could) Do him like a pre-nup
(I mean get him for his re-up) Hoes down, G's up

[Joe Budden]
Clean cut, pour something hot on your mean mug
Star Trek guns outta this world, get beamed up
The last two that you want to see team up
Or link up, FUCK any rapper you think of
Matter fact, ain't a better combo you could dream of

[Hook: Royce Da 5'9", Joe Budden]
[R] Street niggas gettin money, this is {"For you"}
[J] Jail niggas waitin on release, this is {"For you"}
[R] Hoh! Trap stars niggas, this is {"For you"}
[J] Fruck that, bad broads I'm doin it for {"For you"}
[Both] WE, ARE {"Fresh"}

[Joe Budden]
We killin the witness and anyone who maybe saw it
So the court date (they missin the day before it)
Lately flourish coupe, or maybe Porsche it
I'm aware that they hate me for it
I stay with the special like Katie Couric
Diss me, soon as they record it they be corpses

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Flawless models lookin like my lady's porcelain
80's corset that can cause a baby abortion
Take her, to Old Navy or maybe Nordstroms
Get her pregnant, marry her or maybe divorce her
Crazy, if a nigga dandelion
I have him pushin up daisies in a fugazi orifice

[Joe Budden]
I dress half hood, half corporate
If your closet ain't the size of a master bedroom you won't get the portrait

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Bottom line I'mma sign like endorse it
Y'all niggas four different characters played out like Norbit
Of course it's the bosses, shoot it then toss it

[Hook]
