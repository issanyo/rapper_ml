[Royce da 5'9]
I don't specialize in hit-making
I do two things, that's make money, that's get paper
Make fun of you bitch ways, and blaze guns the clip stays in
I don't get hungry, I stay hungry and get cravings
Then I write down rhymes then I switch pages
Then I write more, my lord, I'm with ladies
And my boys, we are to die for, that's why we called
The Suicide Squad
And that's why you can prolly find me on the bike going
One sixty-five through a red light
All you see is a flying head light like I'm on the sideboard
And everybody know the time
About the dirt on our hands
That's because the Lord large hands follows me and my anthologies
You never heard from me, apologies
You’ll never see my soul rise, the streets already done made a man out of me
10 Wallabees, playing Ghost and Chef
Feeling like the man who wrote ‘Success’ should be the most impressed
The man the most emotional who hate the most should be the most motionless
I'll be the oath taking by who be the post of the overtaking streets
The streets where I agreed done taking over
And I swore I would never take an oath
Reading verses from the bible trying to replicate the scroll
In the kitchen whipping words trynna levitate the stove
I ain't from the World-Star era, I slap you in a circle like evolution
And it would not be televised like the revolution
And these vocals should not be melodizied or AutoTuned
Where you recording at, should be transform to an artist's tomb
Started moons many moons ago, you artist doomed
You hardest tunes came many tunes ago
Speaking of hardest, I'm the hardest doing anything that's getting done
Beams on any different gun
Meaning I ain't aiming mine and shit
I just came to find the vic and bring the target to em
While my Suicide Squadron shooting, car spewing, jargon to em'
We turn a blogger into embalming fluid
We've been running through these dollars such a long time
We tired, now we jogging through em
[Hook]
Knowledge over money
Money over power
Power over nothing
Cuz now  we overcoming
{Scratches}
We the suicide squad x2
Reaching for the sky shooting for stars
Me, us,or,  I who you gone call
But the suicide squad

[Marv Won]
Hey Brody
Tell them little niggas life just happened
I'm the fat boy in the nice fashion'
My hands sharp like its knife action
If I can't hit you then the pipe blastin'
We all the same same like we type casting
I'm from the hood I have never seen no white Aston
But over white I have seen red and blue lights flashing
I gotta lead my disciples with a Christ  passion
If I want it, imma get it and I don't like askin'
On the beat is the only time i'm extra nice
I said it right, yo' soul I will extradite
Give me a plate full of ox-tails
No peas with the extra spice
You received some incorrect advice
Slugs shower you and your unsuspecting wife like it was
Wedding rice, I chop you head and sow yo' head to
Behead you twice, Big arms is how I handle words
An angry pop can dismantles spurs, I just came back from Johannesburg where little kids
Can take over your nest with how they handle birds
And I man those nerds I am those curves
In between is the streets, like when you separate
Over bread  in between is the beef
So let's make a sandwich, scrap
Yo squad is soft and you put no
Worries in me i me like i'm Anderson Pat
You scrappin' wear, Apple care is how we handle
A mac, a swift chop is how you handle an axe
That's the same way you handle an ex
Fruit salad got the kiwi green seats and the mandarin vet
I always wanted to do a line like that
Star power bring my shine right back, diamonds from coal brought my grind right back, little nigga obey a
Thirst I brought the limelight back,  so stop
Now and run my limes right back
Killers nigga

[Hook]

Like, hot as a Cali summer
Double-entendre, I land in the best spot
I'm from the Bahamas, small fish but eat, I hung with piranhas
The shit might pop like it hung with yo' mama
All prayers pray, what's in the soul get me
Raw material the men will roll with me
The boy cold, colder than Martin homey
The side window bruh man on hiss fifth floor
They say my mind split but its all part of the schizo
I came to box rappers it's all part of the gift yo'
Yo I have lines, The Fresh Prince showing
Ooze up for pancake, Quadruple entedre
The tundra, whether they going under
I told em' I feel like i'm lumber
Niggas fell into a slumber party, ah'
Boys sleeping I come through the blind-spot ah'
The boy beacon ah',  the boy D can't rap
I came to pass the boy, as for Troy demigod in this bitch
I'm Nimrod in the trenches, best hunting in test with my chin high
The apprentice, men try and get this sick
They ask for aid, I stay above float
I am pass the parade, I pass the charades
Words they gotta guess it
Beef around the block but I heard
They got a lesson, herbs a lot of stressin
Did turn into a vegetable herbs a lot impressive
You let us in the building with curs a lot  of dressing
Yet i'm on your ranch you know the croutons coming
Salad the way I am Cesar to the chickens
I am speaking in tongue I don't need ya'll for the lickin'
All mighty [?], Ya'll pass tall i'm on my hiatus
Trap strain us, i'm in the spot now
We get em chopped down
