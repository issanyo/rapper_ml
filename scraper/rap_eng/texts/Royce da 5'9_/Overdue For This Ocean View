Overdue for This Ocean View
(From the LP 'Jazz.')

[Benny Reid Saxophone Intro]

Royce da 5'9":
In Jesus name standing outside in the freezing rain,
Standing out in that heat out here until the seasons change,
I know what I’m supposed to do,
Therefore so there is no excuse
I been so true, I’m so overdue for this ocean view
My city is about the ability, lyrics and soul.
Making money legitimately is the goal
About to be airing it out where it need to be aired, we’ll see how it goes
Who will carry hip hop on his shoulders? It’s me I suppose...
It’s me I suppose,
All I can do with my time is perfect the flow
Respect the struggle before we just show up the at the show,
For extra dough, No one can protect the door,
No one up like that you know
You want it like quite the opposite,
You want it like x and o with me I suppose
But for now I’m off that violent talk cause you know what I do.
Thank God for sidewalks cause everything ain’t meant to be street
Every rhyme ain't meant to be deep, you gotta have that balance
Far as me, in order to thrive, I’ve had to have that challenge
For now I'm living with the fortune and fame and you can have that camera.

Oh yeah
