[Intro: Royce Da 5'9"]
Bar Exam 3, tramp
Yeah! Whoooooo!

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Fuck is wrong with you? Go and inform your crew
That I can end your career in less than a song or two
I'm a tyrant, I'm like an irate Somalian pirate
You're as threatenin' as Miley Cyrus with the heine virus
Dead a verse, I got more bars than Leavenworth
The present president backwards, call me "Tnediserp"
I shoot niggas with knives, stab niggas with guns
Kiss hands and shake babies, I make the medic hurt
Fuck a producer too, them faggots is fuckboys
I should rap over the Brinks truck backin' up noise
The city's in an uproar over the hustl-or
I got it on lock like up north but much more
These rap niggas sayin' they rollin' on them wheels
But the only rollin' they doin' is rollin' on the pill
They high, speakin' of rollin', we a roll
You will see us get paper before you see us fold
Hip hop nigga, the opposite of neo-soul
The only thing sing is the pistol when I'm takin' Ne-Yo's soul
You aspire to get a chain that's glistenin'
I aspire to get a chain of businesses
I retire niggas, gettin' at me ain't what the business is
I kill the kitten if he witnesses
I make it look easy, before I self destruct
I'ma get some hoes pregnant like 50 and Lil Weezy
I don't give a fuck about shit
Got nothin' to say to y'all but "suck dick", I fuck yo' bitch
And send her back to you, pussy like she been in labor dawg
And when I'm done with her she gon' need a cable all
My dream mistress is a bitch like Nicki Minaj
And if the ass ain't real then I'm with the fa√ßade
The pistol, the pen, drinkin' with me, pick your demise
The silencers screwed on now the clips in disguise
Now who the fuck goin' harder than Nickel
I take a shit on any nigga, no regard for tissue
I go hard; so much harder than everybody
I John Doe tag the toe of every body

[Hook: Fake Rihanna]
We go hard
Oh yeah eh eh, we go hard
That I, I, I, we go hard
Oh yeeeeah-ay ay, we go hard
That I, I, I, we go hard
Oh yeeeeah-ay ay, we go hard
Go hard, so hard
So hard, so hard, whoa-oh (Let it breathe)

[Post-Hook: Fake Rihanna]
The best nigga in the game, yeah, you know this
The game never be the same, yeah, you know this

[Verse 2: Kid Vishis]
(Kid Vishis!) Ignite violence, make him swallow shells
That'll clog his windpipe, make the doctor do the Heimlich
Fightin' for the loot like a riot; this is Pay-Per-View
Rap niggas don't get it unless they buyin' this
Blame it on the drugs like Steve-O, you still a Jackass
I spit dope, my fans got a crack habit
If you can beat me on beats congrats
The sore loser when I snatch him out the booth then I beat his ass
What you call rappin', I call trash
Every punch you call strong, I call jabs, so listen
I'm sicker than a stripper, if you tip her, give her fifties and twenties
Hit the lights she realize it's counterfeit money
My niggas get large cash
Push the rock good as Bobby Hurley 'fore the car crash
I get star cash, tour cash, more cash
Don't wanna pay me, I'mma take it out of your ass
Do what you want fam, I say fam cause I fry a man
Feelin' angry man, I'll flight 'em in
Honestly godly, what fool wanna battle me?
I use the Earth as a cue and shoot pool with the galaxy
Few could challenge me, who do catastrophe
Three cash, guns point the guard, I'm Steve Nash
You a rap group, I'll slap through
The only time you see a gun is when mine is pointin' at you
Skip the church and the reverend I'mma put 'em on a 747
And the destination's Heaven
For example, break into my notebook
And find more shit than the cops friskin' Rambo
Make 'em fade to black, fit 'em for a blindfold
Told you I'm a Dibo pitbull, die slow
I'll really hit your crib with the semi
Break a nigga baby back and ribs, I call my bullets Chili's
