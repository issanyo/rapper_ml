(Verse-Foster)
A matter of time 'fore you rappers get shook down
A ladder to climb higher than you should look down
A pattern of crime, might inspire the hood now
Let 'em look around, I'm showing 'em how it could sound
It's just a throwback to my younger days
Back to open mics, when I was still underage
Still hear the hunger pains, misfits, runaways
Way too gutter to give a fuck what the numbers say
Right about now, I'ma need a reaction
Or at least of gallon of gasoline and a matchstick
Burn it all down, industry full of catfish
Flash in the pan, has-beens, I'm the blacklist
What happens when you ain't ass kissin' the wackness
And I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
'til then, it ain't over 'til I put it to bed...
And this is live as it gets

(Chorus)
Lost in a world between my days and nights
I'll take you there but will you take my side?
I know they watching, can't escape their eye
You playing by the rules
I say you fools are wastin' time

(Verse-Royce Da 5'9")
Uh, the sawed-off 'bout to lift y'all all
'bout to disregard law, just to piss y'all off
I could diss y'all all, I'm the shit so don't get smoked
Around this bitch, I could piss Pall Mall
Call me Nick, not short for Santa Claus
If I wanna shine, I could get Paul Wall
But never do I back down, not a chance
I will smack down like my hand on a ass on a private
Dance...I got a problem with the whole Earth
I'm short from rock bottom with no growth spurts
Stomach burnin', no ulcer
No earnin', court is adjourned, no sir
Suits and ties, dodging lies and logic
I've been tried, me and vibes is vibin'
You couldn't dream my dreams, you couldn't daydream my theme
Feel my pain 'cause...

(Chorus)
Lost in a world between my days and nights
I'll take you there but will you take my side?
I know they watching, can't escape their eye
You playing by the rules
I say you fools are wastin' time
