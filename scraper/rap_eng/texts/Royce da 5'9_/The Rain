[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9'']
I'm a product of when a nigga momma gives up
Crying, laying in the trash with the lid shut
Ain't got no family, my mind is tender
My daddy's invisible, my moms is Brenda
If I survive I'ma grow into what society considers trash
The rope is to us that mean' I'm hangin' myself by livin'
The noose is gettin' murdered, that or going to prison
My mind's controlled 'fore I learn mind control
What you call livin' life, I call dyin' slow, I'm genetically predisposed
The reaper the only thing that can ease my soul, freezin' cold
Feelin' like I was givin' life and if I take it, at least I chose
I probably be in Heaven when the pain stops
'Till then all I'm hearin' is wind and raindrops

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Precipitation got my mind trippin'
Got me visualizin' suicide, take away from how I'm livin'
They say I'm God's children
Just know the odds that I dodge everyday don't oblige with him
[?], uh, the city is drug, makin' me a livin' though
Playin' tug of war with life, momma [?]
Holdin' on a onion, hustlin' out a bungalow
Eyes designed to keep in mind that there's a end road
Ambition in us in a N-O, livin' conditions criminal
Intuition he gon' see a mortician, uh, sicker than a kinfolk
Stiffin' their position, probably be in Hell when the pain pop
Till then all I'm hearin' is wind and raindrops

[Verse 3: Swifty McVay]
My life remains raw, containin' pain, tryna hang on
Everyday it be rainin' chainsaws, tryna maintain a relationship with God, while Satan is gasolin' in my drawers, I gotta stay strong
I'm wastin' paper, ladies in labor
You tryna take away my forty eight acres and strip me naked
My life's sacred, you never see me fakin' until I make it
I'm hopin' that God open that gate before I break it
Promises after promises
You'd think my momma done raise me to have no common sense
I keep swimmin' in obamanation
Drinks with hatred, bottle after bottle of mixed vodka
Click-clackin' a forty fifth
I know I'm gifted, but I won't use it for shit, by my own interests
As soon as I get rid of that selfish, bold instinct, I [?]
I be holdin' the [?] umbrella hidin' from raindrops
