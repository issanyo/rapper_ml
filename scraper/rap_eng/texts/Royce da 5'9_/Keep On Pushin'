"Keep on pushin'" [x8]

[Verse One]
Coke rises, so high with no pride
Wow, we all coppin', that's Blow time
0-5 was so live, but oh my
God, we lost Cochran
That's mo' time
At no time from 0-5 and back
Was I happy we lost tears
Cause we lost B.I.G
And we lost Pac
And we not supposed to be rap beefin' but we all did
Yeah, why do all have to be such a disaster?
For the city, us and D-Twizzy hustlin' backwards
I'd like
To ask Eminem when the time's right
Why did you shut down The Source before I got me my five mics?
At least I got the Quotable
I was just on the road with Proof
At least I got some shows to do
What you supposed to do is
Snatch up who's close to you and
Someone who know what they doin'
Pack up that car with that heat gone and keep on

[Hook]
"Pushin'"
Doin' what you was doin' before
"Keep on pushin'"
If you know what you doin' it for
"Keep on pushin'"
If you at peace or you in a war
"Keep on pushin'"
Just make it through and the world is yours
"Keep on pushin'
Just make it through and the world is yours
"Keep on pushin'"

Just make it through and the world is yours
"Keep on pushin'"
Doin' what you was doin' before
"Keep on pushin'"
If you know why you doin' it
"Keep on pushin'"

[Bridge]
It's just me and "Statik"
With the blue pigs in the rear
View mirror with the two cigs in the ear
Like, Who cares? This is a new year
Nigga we got somethin' to do here

[Verse Two]
0-6
We gonna be comin' with mo' shit
The most wicked
We got something to prove here
The coke fix is
Back like crack
The 80's is at ya
The only ink that's sicker is maybe the tattoo
When them players is at you/achu
Blowin' they triggers
You gone
The only thing stiffer is maybe a statue
C'mon
He deliver like that stork
He bring light to your porch
He bring night and he ain't lightin' your torch
His king sight just seems like Yao Ming's height
He sees over
He don't need to lean over
He don't need to move you to see on
He only will do it when he tell you to keep on...

[Hook]

[Bridge]
It's just me and (who?) Whoo Kid

With the blue pigs in the rear

View mirror with the two cigs in the ear

Like, Who cares? This a new year
Nigga we got somethin' to do here
