[Verse One] [Royce Da 5'9"]:
Nickel
I ain't body nobody
Besides if I did, I'd prolly lie
And say I didn't cause I'm free now
But inside I'm a concrete guy
So do that make me a liar?
Douse my soul then throw it in the fire
Without me you know you'd be admired
Now put my away for my sins cause the Lord knows
Instead of away in the pen cause the boy told
Ever since 5 years old it was music
That put me in touch with my freedom
Therefore it's proven, 24 years later, music
Put me in them blues, shouldn't been abusin'
What's been good to me through this
This is for them losers wishin' I would chicken out and lose it
Miserable, alone niggas wishin' I was home with 'em, hate
I'mma go 'head and shake 'em
I stay low
In the grey fo'
Doe Range Ro' with the cocaine flow
I ghostwrite yo
I wrote Dre 4
I roll like I'm old like I know K. Blow
I spit shit fly
You nitwits try
To see me, you be leavin' with Slick Rick's eye
That's the closest you comin' to bein' Ricky D
You can smell the smoke of the gun now give me fifty feet
