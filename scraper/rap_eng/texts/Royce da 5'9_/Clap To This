[Hook]
Clap to this
Getting amped in the front and the back to this, oh where you at
Rock with me, clap to this
Getting amped in the front and the back to this, oh where it at
Rock with me, clap to this
Getting amped in the front and the back to this, oh where that at
Rock with me, clap to this
Getting amped in the front and the back

[Verse 1]
With all spirit, I set it off so you all hear it
If I'm ain't up there with the best of them, I must fall near it
What nigga, I can rock you without a [?]
5'9" spits *hah-too* hot shit
Take it back to the basement, house parties
Niggas pissy and wasted, hustling with straight faces
Ayo toots, nice rump, smoking skunk, got a tight blunt
With a hunch, I'm drinking spiked punch
DJ's cop and cover the labels
Forever mad at the same drunk nigga bumping the table
Choking in Molson Ice, who's most nice with flows tight
Who knows until we open the mic, right
Two cats blast off on each other
Like KRS and Shan back in the day before the last call
If a square there, I'ma inhale one
If your mans fall out drunk, then pick him up, pick him up
Put him in his car, drive him to his house, take him out
Put him on the porch, ring the bell and run *ding dong*
Go back and get that chick you was scoping and get her open
Blow smoke up or whip lies to get her hopes up
Tell her that she been on your mind ever since you woke up
If she digging the line, she trying to get her to post up
Don't play it slow, do your thing, try to get every girl in here
The most that they can say to you is no

[Hook]
Rock with me, clap to this
Getting amped in the front and the back to this, oh where you at
Rock with me, clap to this
Getting amped in the front and the back to this, oh where it at
Rock with me, clap to this
Getting amped in the front and the back to this, oh where that at
Rock with me, clap to this
Getting amped in the front and the back

[Verse 2]
Where you at, huh? Ladies, where you at, huh?
In the back?
The spiritual lift with gift on some miracle shit
I like it, that's why I bang it, ain't nothing niggas can do to change it
It's funny, they wanted Juicy
I'm 20 with money, I think that's something they ain't used to
Did a song where it end at them, that's why they call it a hit
It comes along with the impact
I'm nicer than most, and I ain't from the east or the west
But if I do a show and they give me love, them I'm hyping the coast
Detroit what, that's where I spill heat from
And wherever you at, that's where you feel me from
I got it on lock, the rap game is like a pistol
'Cause you can get in a jam when you should've shot it on [?]
Do I make you hyped, clap to this
I better live it and dial 3-1-3 and seven digits
I make songs for women, songs for ballers
Songs for niggas in impalas toting revolvers
Songs for stuck up girls, gangbangers who rob and touch up curls
Before they get drunk and hurl
Songs for every borough, songs for rich misses who touch up pearls
And these fucked up girls
Songs for you, songs for him
Songs for niggas who hate boots, and songs for niggas who love timbs
