[Verse 1]
Yeah, I got money on my mind, that's why I'm twice on my grind
I'm nice cause I rhyme like it's my life's on that line
The second that I'm provoked, I snap into a point
That ain't controllable, then it's either war, or another quotable
Don't let me get a hold of you dudes, I'll murder you on camera
Get Kelly's lawyer and get a mole removed
I probably shouldn't have said that, fuck y'all, on the record
Off the record, if I'm on the record I'ma off the record
I need a push when I'm tired of rhyming, go 'head
Diss me, 'cause me and George Bush got a lot in common
We both got no sense, we love to go to war
And we stay looking for weapons of mass destruction
This industry is Hilary Clinton literally, listen
You ain't got no choice now, roll with a nigga
If you twisted enough to picture a devil mixed with a angel
That's sick, drunk inside a Range Rov, that's this
Wish I could stick every rapper in this bitch in a building
Let 'em cypher while I fly a plane through that bitch
Cause I hate y'all, I'm tri-polar with the 8 ball
If I want you on my album, I pull out the K and make y'all
In case y'all wanna share my light, I'm gonna tell it like it is
Fuck it, it's my Jeremiah Wright
I'm a motherfucking problem, I don't care if y'all don't like
Times three nigga, I'm me nigga

[Interlude]
I'm me, nigga

[Verse 2]
Big dick, bitch, big balls
We the kind that supply the rock like Chris Paul
The same kind that aim 9s, insane conscience
And then we get rid of the rock like Dwayne Johnson
Ladykiller, the fly version of Orenthal
You ain't got no DUIs then you probably a cornball
Wittiest, if you call a laptop a labtop
You sound like a scientist, but you probably a idiot
Your stories ain't holding up, y'all niggas lying
Got me thinking y'all either too young or y'all ain't old enough
Niggas saying, "When Royce gonna stop beefing with rappers?"
Bitch, when hell freeze over and Wayne sober up
By the way, fuck all DJs! I'm just kidding
I just threw that in there to get y'all attention
No intention of ever dying, nigga, life too sweet
Two words for who don't like me, "fight" and "me"
I take care of my family, they say
"Do the kid rock like Pam Lee?" The answer is yes
And I invest, it takes money to make money
So I make green off Green like Stan Lee
Smart shit, I ain't got beef with no Joe Budden
Y'all gon' get one of these niggas killed trying to start shit
Niggas hire muscle 'cause living is a privilege
The only rapper I admire for his strength is Xzibit

[Verse 3]
I killed it, right away
Soon as you cross, go 'head, you got the right-a-way
Give a nigga iron like vitamin, play
I will ride up in broad day and night a nigga day
Drunk! I'm a recovering outpatient
You at the top, you shot, your spot is now taken
Psychotic is the ploy, how the fuck you rapping and you gay
And you've been spotted with a boy like a Dalmatian?
If I switch up, I'd probably be instantly selling
Got a clip full of pellets known as MC repellent
While you talkin  bout your money and how I can't have none of it
I'll hit a nigga low, just for the Zab fun of it
I will never lose, never lost, I'mma prove it
Except for my virginity, but I was trying to lose it
I be on some Tom Cruise shit standing on the couch
In the club, laughing bout my dime new chick
She the shit, but if you ask her she useless, I'm in the pocket
'Cause got a rocket down under like Houston
So I'm gonna keep being me and you should keep being you
If being you offends me, indeed, it's gonna be me and you
But understand that if it's that, it's either gonna be me or you
So pump your brakes before I do you like a got a key to you
Shut your power off, I'm a G-A-N-G
S-T-ARR, yes, we are, bitch, I'm *gunshot*
