Yeah, the street's gotta code
Cause being loud is old
Silent is gold, smile and unload
No police gotta know
Cause when ya problem is told
Ya problem isn't getting told, that's a no
I'ma tell a couple stories about the notorious route
That niggas take when they thirst, hear me out
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

[1st story - Soulja Slim]
Here's a little story, I got to tell about
A couple dudes who didn't know so well
They didn't get a chance to blow but they could flow so well
This is the perfect time for you haters to go, oh well
Let's take it down to the Nolia where them boys is warriors
They notorious for ordering more then just hits, so
Take heed, I seen dude in the V and the D
He musta been moving with B.G
Before "Slow Motion" I heard dude was so focused
On the street credibility, he's a "Soldier"
Would he rather have beef or exposure
I don't know, I never met him
I just know that I ain't trying to forget him
As soon as he went home, the place he got the most love
Niggas popped up and shot him in cold blood
At the worst time and they crept up behind him
And uh, just rewinded em

[2nd story -  Blade Icewood]
Story Two
I said boyyyyy, would you boss up and get this money
For my niggas who ain't here
Bring the treeeees, and blow a huge cloud in the air
For niggas who move without fear
Gotta pour more than a beer, nigga pour out a fifth
Fuck it we rich nigga, pour out some Cris
A young nigga got shot up once, put in a wheelchair
Still liked to light up blunts like "look, I'm still here"
It's so true
He came out of the hospital with way more money, way more jewels
Roll through, any hood that you want in the City of Detroit
They playing one of his tunes
He prolly shoulda been with a goon
He stopped at a car wash
I guess the dude he was with ain't know what to do
They crept up on the side of 'em and
Put the nine to 'em and, just rewinded em

[3rd story = Big L]
Story Three
We bout to take the NYC
They know about him in the NYC
But they don't know him in the D
As far as emceeing, this nigga was crazy
Muthafuckas used to say he was better than Jay-Z
The first time time I heard him was '95 "Ebonics"
I played it and all my niggas was high tryin to rewind it
Them niggas was like, "Daaaammnn"
This nigga said that a snot box was a nose
Without stopping the flow and I was like, "maannnnn"
I swear to God that this nigga's a problem
I think he better than Nas (damn)
He's so ahead of his time, you play his music in 0-6
This nigga sound regular now
I heard that he was thugging, had a brother who was thugging
He was sitting on a stoop and he didn't see it comin
They crept up in front of em and
Put the gun to em and, just rewinded em
