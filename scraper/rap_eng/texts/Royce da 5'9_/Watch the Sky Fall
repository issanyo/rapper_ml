[Chorus: Koncept]
The problems that you face, not always easily determined
Need to read it for yourself before the reading of your sermon
Watch the sky fall!
Fucking traffic route's delayed
It's an eyesore
Go and catch it; choose your lane

The problems that you face, not always easily determined
Need to read it for yourself before the reading of your sermon
Watch the sky fall!
Fucking traffic route's delayed
It's an eyesore
Go and catch it; choose your lane

[Verse 1: Koncept]
See, they been hassling you
Them blue suits had you shackled and bruised
I'm happy like used
New shoes tracking my moves
And after I choose my wrath
Every rapper will lose
I last laugh cause fast I'm scrapping 'em, too
You hurt, murder yourself
Your words burning for help
If seen in first person, be the first person to tell
Why isn't merch selling?
Cause self is selling itself
Sometime, my first verse will be the first verse that you felt
As Earth's burning in Hell
The same place that your son was born in
11:13, the train leaves, I been running for it
Mother had the daughter leave the son-in-law
Love is torn
Can't sew a button on
I'm depressing when there's someone gone
Hanging from a cliff and the rope is stone cold
With no coat and so broke, stuck in this chokehold
And soap don't wash your hands when most of your soul's sold
The low blow's me and your girl up in your own home

[Chorus: Koncept]
The problems that you face, not always easily determined
Need to read it for yourself before the reading of your sermon
Watch the sky fall!
Fucking traffic route's delayed
It's an eyesore
Go and catch it; choose your lane

The problems that you face, not always easily determined
Need to read it for yourself before the reading of your sermon
Watch the sky fall!
Fucking traffic route's delayed
It's an eyesore
Go and catch it; choose your lane

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9]
Dealing with industry drama
The soul of my dead enemies sending me karma
While I'm trying to get around life's obstacles
I hop over my party; I rock and roll
Like Jimi Hendrix is sitting, writing my dreams
Playing the guitar in the key of life to my theme
Confetti and streamers
Follow me as I pedal my Beamer
Life is a party; I'm selling my soul
When I'm losing, I'm losing
When I'm winning, I'm losing
Too many that are burning in Hell have been in my shoes and
Choosing success over life to enfuse 'em
Struggling's a intrusion, the confusion
I bend rules and
The law's looking like a horseshoe
Wife divorce you
Now the high life support you
I didn't know what I was serving to myself
Myself turned out to be the biggest hurdle in itself

[Chorus: Koncept]
The problems that you face, not always easily determined
Need to read it for yourself before the reading of your sermon
Watch the sky fall!
Fucking traffic route's delayed
It's an eyesore
Go and catch it; choose your lane

The problems that you face, not always easily determined
Need to read it for yourself before the reading of your sermon
Watch the sky fall!
Fucking traffic route's delayed
It's an eyesore
Go and catch it; choose your lane
