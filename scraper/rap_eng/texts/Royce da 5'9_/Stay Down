[Intro: various samples]
(Green Lantern!)
I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League
Clap, clap, clap your hands, everybody
Clap your hands, everybody
Just clap, clap, clap your hands, everybody
Clap your hands, everybody
Clap, clap, clap your hands, everybody

[Verse 1]
I'm at war with the cops, sitting in the trap at 17
Drinking 7Up, I'm gon' mature with the spot
Young, black, apologetic, unpolished
Bet there'll never be another one solid
As I am, cuz I am down to put this iron down and go
One on one with anyone who wanna go
Nighty like pajama soldier life
Hut one, show you right, that don't mean snap the ball
That mean it's a gat involved, went from packing basketballs
To packing all the pockets in my jacket full with packs of raw
Laughing with the bitches looking at and laughing at the law
Capping with my niggas with the mama jokes
Oh lawdy, yo' mama rode over a dollar and made four quarters
Get money

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9" & The Notorious B.I.G. (sample)]
I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
I'm probably knocking at your door, y'all should let us in (do it!)
Mama telling me it's for my own good
Angel on my shoulder saying don't do it, Devil said ("do it")
Out all night, I'm out all night
Temptation, I think I'm gon' (do it)
Out all night, I'm out all night
Temptation, I think I'm gon' (do it)

[Verse 2]
Streets calling out my name like attendance at the school
That kid, yeah, he bad, I could finish that for you
The Mac-10 and back to Cube, the crack in the baggy, ooh
That's a group riding past the pastor with the baggy suit
Muslims on the corner with the bag of fruit
Big booty bitches pushing strollers with the attitude
We know why you got an attitude so we not asking you
We just wanna hit it without hearing what the daddy do
Every fly car that ride by is motivation
Every broken home is separated by coalition
Yesterday we played tackle in aisle, formation out today
I'm in the crack house and as I formulate
Get money

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9" & The Notorious B.I.G. (sample)]
I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
I'm probably knocking at your door, y'all should let us in (do it!)
Mama telling me it's for my own good
Angel on my shoulder saying don't do it, Devil said ("do it")
Out all night, I'm out all night
Temptation, I think I'm gon' (do it)
Out all night, I'm out all night
Temptation, I think I'm gon' (do it)

[Interlude]
Royce 5'9"
Turning it out
Justice League
Turning it out
Crack crack then I, turning it out
We turning out
Alright, alright

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9" & The Notorious B.I.G. (sample)]
I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
I'm probably knocking at your door, y'all should let us in (do it!)
Mama telling me it's for my own good
Angel on my shoulder saying don't do it, Devil said ("do it")
Out all night, I'm out all night
Temptation, I think I'm gon' (do it)
Out all night, I'm out all night
Temptation, I think I'm gon' (do it)
