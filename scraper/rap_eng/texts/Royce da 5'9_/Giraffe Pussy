[Intro: Ras Kass]
Ah. Lions and Lakers. I am Ras Kass representing C-Arson California with my nigga Bishop Lamont. And representing the D, Apollo Brown and Nickel. Royce Da 5'9"!

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
I could swim the English Channel with all these arms I got
Fully automatic karma tryna disarm my plot
I’m honorin’ invites to fight, just wait there
I’m givin’ out beats like the Dre pair
I’m comin’ with straps like a straight jacket
Nah I ain’t puttin’ nothin’ on Worldstar
I’m creepin’ on yah, keep it under your hat like Sway hair
Nickel, Razzy and Crook’ll spark
The thought that’ll triple author the book of sharks
I told my Phantom driver
I said “Phantom driver, take me to the Opera
Waited ’til we got there, then I shot him
Just so we could look the part
My bitch just sit in my bed and wait for me
Even though all the threads’ snazzy, she never wear ‘em
Your bitch a chickenhead, mines is inconspicuous
Even on Twitter, I crack her head if she don't use an egg avi
I've been possessed since the Nature Of The Threat drop
Jordan shoe of recordin', you a whore to your label, your label a sweatshop

[Hook: Xzibit]
I feel so inspired, never kneel to a false messiah
Gettin' higher than giraffe pussy
Push me, I'm no liar, flatten you niggas like 4 flat tires
Gettin' higher than giraffe pussy
Gettin' higher than giraffe pussy
Gettin' higher than giraffe pussy
Gettin' higher than giraffe pussy

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
I'm higher than your ascendin' messiah
On the original Easter, supernatural creature
I'm tryna Worldstar every mothafuckin' feature
Kick you while you're down in the face, Sharkeisha
Niggas is lame, playin' a knockout game
I hope all your mothers get the same, real talk
This is hip hop on bath salts
I be in the streets like lanes, litter and asphalt
Why am I such an asshole? Probably my dad's fault
It's an Austin thing, nigga
Little rock, big cop
Time is money; the guap is tick-tock
Landed a 'copter in the jungles, me and Rick Rock
Hopped out and showed the Bloods respect
'Cause I love the West, plus I got love for Hex Murda
That means I love the D, what up though?
My Cal d'in bitch gun tote, nickel plated snub nose
So run home
I be seein' rappers out standin' in the front row
Secondhand blunt smoke
For my niggas in the pen playin' tunk though
Bring 'em 85 off that 36 months though

[Hook: Xzibit]
I feel so inspired, never kneel to a false messiah
Gettin' higher than giraffe pussy
Push me, I'm no liar, flatten you niggas like 4 flat tires
Gettin' higher than giraffe pussy
Gettin' higher than giraffe pussy
Gettin' higher than giraffe pussy
Gettin' higher than giraffe pussy

[Verse 3: Bishop Lamont]
I can show you how real style gets spit
Lava, underwater
Volcanic my standard, I incinerate your blah blah
You too green, new to this thing
You soft niggas sweet like guava
I like my bitches kinky, swallow nut like German lager
Speakin' of German, I go off like V2's
My word play is D-Day if I choose
I'm unenthused with you phony dudes and your crews
You Ali G in Borat
Talk shit, I'm on your front porch like a doormat
What you say?
I'm SoCal, Carson City my locale
I've been at this since niggas used to go see Cal
Yeah, you ride my dick, too many on it like a slave ship
My penmanship's a scorpion's tail tip, poison
Deadly, I put lead in yah, more guts the merrier
I'm Gonna Git You Sucka [?] like Hayes but never slippin'
Slip the clip in, it's a wrap, get mummified
Play Egyptian, Mumm-Ra, cartoon, your description
Make you poof like Harry who? I'm no magician
Listen, phony formats, don't fuck with none of that

[Hook: Xzibit]
I feel so inspired, never kneel to a false messiah
Gettin' higher than giraffe pussy
Push me, I'm no liar, flatten you niggas like 4 flat tires
Gettin' higher than giraffe pussy
Gettin' higher than giraffe pussy
Gettin' higher than giraffe pussy
Gettin' higher than giraffe pussy
