[Intro: Claret Jai]
The poor stays poor, the rich get richer
It’s just so disproportionate

[Chorus: Claret Jai]
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I go through
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it
Every rule, I'm breakin' it

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Terrible, but not rip-able, invincible, I hung invisible
Fuckin' mistletoe all over the world, I stuck my ass up under it
Now pucker up them lips and kiss it, hoes
Here we go, Bad and Evil so you know how this'll go
The competition's miserable, we stomp them bitches this is no
Joke, goin' overboard like someone threw us off the boat, choke
Cough from all the smoke, I'm tryna stay on fire
So you know if I hate fucking water sprinklers
I don't love the hose
Someone let the cat out the bag, now it's time to stuff its face
Back in that bitch, smother that little
Motherfucker 'til it suffocates (Who?)
You had long enough of a wait, why are they
Tryin' to be so secretive? Bad and Evil is reunited, hey!
Came back to annihilate, the game's in dire straights as I await
Word on Satan as I drop, fall to my knees before this
Ouija board and I pray, now I lay me down to sleep
I do this shit in my sleep, I’m sleepin' now, imagine if I awake?
I'm champ, bitch, I'll never taste the canvas
Could never be no damn wuss or pussy
Never mushy, so you can't squish
Nowhere near a tush, in fact if I jump out a bush
In a sneak attack's, the only way I'll say I am-Bush
Outlandish, these words are weapons that I brandish
Stand-offish to hoes, keep your hands off this
Can't top it, so what the fuck would I sugarcoat it for?
Law? Fuck protocol, I'd holla at this ho
But now my throat is sore

[Chorus: Claret Jai]
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I go through
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it
Every rule, I'm breakin' it (Royce!)

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
Baby, I'm lawless
You couldn't burn me if you threw acid on me
I'm at ya, homie, I'm at your home ready to spray you
While you nappin', homie, have everything on and around
Your mattress lookin' like the word in front of a matrimony
You high, thug? Yeah, go 'head, jump, no matter how high you get
You gon' come up short like Spud Webb
My DUIs get waived like sayin' bye
Still ridin' with no L's like James Todd, can't change, I
I thank God for my safe thinkin', last time I was safe thinkin'
Me and my niggas was doin' a bank job
I stay violent, y'all go the peace route
You got a mouth like Kanye
I'll knock your whole bottom row of teeth out
No disrespect to Mr. West, shit, I'm just nice with mine
And this just rap, I'm just like Ricky Hatton, I just like the line
These weak rappers want to set us up, they never tough
They ask me for a hook, I tell 'em, left or right? Head or gut?
What y'all messin' with is a nigga that'll leave you FUBAR
Fucked up beyond all recognition
Y'all are rock stars, I'm the opposite, I could just
Throw a rock and hit a star for the fuck of it
Partner, you're not hard, I body your hot bars
Beef is left you pray, right like Allahu Akbar
Let's go, when I leave y'all shot, you ain't gon' be on your Metro
In a bad area that call dropped

[Chorus: Claret Jai]
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I go through
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it
Every rule, I'm breakin' it
