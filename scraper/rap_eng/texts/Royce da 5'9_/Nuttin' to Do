[Intro: Royce Da 5'9" + Eminem]
What?
Uh
The Bad!
Yeah
The Evil!
The Bad, the Evil!
Put 'em together...

[Hook: Royce Da 5'9" + Eminem]
If it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
I'm just fucking with you, 'cause I got nothing to do

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I came in the diner with skateboarders and placed orders
Ate hors d'Å“uvres and hit the waiter with plate warmers
Let you inhale the Glock smell while I'm ripping your wallet off
And slipping a Molotov in your Cocktail
Burning your contracts punch your A&R in the face
Smash his glasses and turn 'em to contacts
I'm on some Suge shit, if it's missing I took it
Nurse, look at this straitjacket; it's crooked
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (FedEx)
So how do you describe someone with a decapitated head
When the rest of his body's still alive running?

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Coming with five gunmen, waiting to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500, hide from it
For every hundred emcees rhyming about birds
Only about two thirds really said it without words
Yo, you ain't a thug, I can make you bitch up
Pick the fifth up, cock, spit, you would swear it's raining slugs
I'm the hottest shit in the industry
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me, defending me
You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The Bad and Evil mad rap, I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this shit'll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up, you get hit, ten down and ten up
I take it if you run your mouth, then you wanna get sent up
Heat it up, you be leaking blood and spitting phlegm up
Now we rivals, 'cause of a small name or title
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and Bible

[Hook: Royce Da 5'9" and Eminem]
Yo, if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
And, if it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
I'm just fucking with you, 'cause I got nothing to do

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Forget a chorus, my metaphors are so complicated
It takes six minutes to get applause
And by the time you all catch on, I'mma end your career
And walk away with the whole floor so you have nothing to fall back on
I'll throw you off of ten floors
Pull a fucking headache outta my head, and put it in yours (Take this)
I'm indoors, waiting for this acid to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores
This bitch wanted to blow me, I said it oughta happen
You swallow cum bitch? "No, but I brought a napkin"
Getting skully while I'm autographing
Got my daughter laughing 'cause I sent her mother whitewater rafting
I'm not a fact, I'm a proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocked up my U-haul screaming "You ain't moving here"
Lorena Bobbitt, c'mere, want a souvenir?
I've been high as fuck, since I was a juvi-neer
Juvenile? Same difference, I need some 'caine
'Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up to seven slain infants
Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same 'cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'

[Verse 4: Royce Da 5'9"]
Walking in swamp water with an M-16
Out for the blood, shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places
Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, ice in my veins, blowing your hand off
Dancing with the Devil leading, I won't die, I'm never leaving
I pledge allegiance to forever breathing
Street niggas with nuts, what? My meat's bigger
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a deathwish, thinking I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace
For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through 'em, put the heat to 'em
Be careful you might get what you ask for

[Hook: Royce Da 5'9" and Eminem]
Yo, if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
And if it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
I'm just fucking with you, 'cause I got nothing to do
