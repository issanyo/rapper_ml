[Intro: Royce da 5'9"]
What (What) [?] Strick, Royce da 5'9"
Rock-A-Block all day
Yo, yo
True that!

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Veteran that'll never retire
Devilish, judge the red in my eye
Judge the nine instead of my size
Ahead of my time, the second coming of a legend that rhymes
That'll shine whenever I die
We never lie, you'll never get by
U just got love, I used to roll wit big shot thugs to hip hop clubs
To act up, the fifth got hugged and blasted
Pits got dugged and filled back up wit stiffs wrapped up in plastic
Give me a heater, you givin' me a reason to shoot
You givin' me the key to your coupe
Midwest, not the middle, Strick clutchin' the five
Wavin' the Tec out the window, clip touchin' the tire
Shit is over

[Chorus: Strick]
Shit is over, shit is over
The shit is over, the shit is over
Cuz' ain't nobody fuckin' wit us
Ain't nobody fuckin' with us
Shit is over, shit is over
Shit is over, shit is over
Cuz' ain't nobody fuckin' with us
Ain't nobody fuckin' with us

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
What, what
You're not in a least, above gettin' shot in the street
I show up at cyphers and they scatter like I'm the police
Now we got a bunch of drug-connected thugs on records
Stripped butt-naked runnin' when they blood is tested
All ya'll niggas stink, real niggas know what a bitch smell like
Tell you how we tell lies, tell what he wear his hair like
You can't amaze the amazing, change your ways
We plant bodies, throw stones wit the names engraved
The games you play, make me point this thang your way
My niggas rob for consistency, a chain a day
I'm about as humble as I can pretend to be
A real nigga's best friend, a bitch nigga's worst enemy
It don't hurt, it offends me
The chrome bursts in a frenzy
It's gon' work till it's empty
Just makin' sure that my gun shoots faster than yours
And I'm chasin' you, and my bullets is chasin' yours

[Chorus: Strick]
Shit is over, shit is over
The shit is over, the shit is over
Cuz' ain't nobody fuckin' wit us
Ain't nobody fuckin' with us
Shit is over, shit is over
Shit is over, shit is over
Cuz' ain't nobody fuckin' with us
Ain't nobody fuckin' with us

[Outro: Royce da 5'9"]
Yeah, Big Strick, Royce the 5'9''
