[Intro: Royce da 5’9”]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Royce da 5’9”]
Gangsta
The way he carries himself
Made man more concerned with wealth than he is his health
Gangsta
He pumps like 24/7 just to get to heaven and pump some mo'
Gangsta
Heavyweight paper
Heart of a lion that beats longer than every pacemaker
Yeah, we ridin', we gon' die foolin'
Laws and rules don't apply to me!
Gangsta

[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9”]
I'mma put this straight
I'm not gon' threaten you with hooks if you look this way
I'm not gon' write no songs so please don't think
That since sometimes I'm quiet that I bite my tongue
'Cause I will slice you punks with knives that come with teeth
So leave with life as long as come in peace
I'm the protocol of all the street rules
Soldiers, ballers please, I know all
I'm goin' all out - for everything I believe in
Niggas bleed behind things that I know about (yeah)
Gangsta
Hear me roar
Feel me nigga; naw fuck that, feel me more
And whoever sayin' fuck me can suck it, we can bang
I done came a long way from "U Can't Touch Me" (nigga)

My swagger's crazy
We can forget your momma ever had a baby
Reachers; I don't care who the fuck you is
Keep yo' hands to yourself, I will cut yo' limbs off
Sixty shots'll quickly hit you
Pop Dixie Chicks of rap, piss me off! (yeah)
Yeah, I'm strictly Pesci - you hear me: a made man
I would rather you fear me than to have you respect me (yeah)
The TEC's good
Jamming's always out the question, call me Suge' of the Midwest wood (yeah)
The part of the poem that's deep
He will blast you after he's had a glass of Bacardi Limon (yeah)
Let's get it on, I'm strictly the classic rap
You know it's on, soon as you rip off the plastic (yeah)

He knows his gun and his knife
Gangsta
More than he knows his son and his wife
Gangsta
Always huntin' niggas, never hunted
Gangsta
You can bet eleven-hundred - he is

[Verse 3: Cutty Mack]
(Yeah) As ignorant as it gets
Cutthroat - the calmest person niggas, push me shits (yeah)
Bawlin' over, the quickest to snap
I'll break you then shake your soul, deliver you back
To the hood that raised you, bruise and mace ya
Lose your face through picture glass, break and waste ya
I'm the essence of the use of violence
Move in silence, hunt you, then I'll close your eyelids (close)
I'm goin' all out - my enemies on they knees
Harder I squeeze, bullets'll leave your brains out (back up!)
Gangsta
Watch me move
I'll speak the language of heat, plus I'm good with the tools (yeah)
So whoever wanna hit me, come quickly
Nothing to lose, I'm no bitch nigga, please come get me - killa
