[Verse]
Im'ma give it to you straight this time, lace this bomb
Bring it to your face 'til the jakes respond
Guard your shit, and I don't care how hard y'all hit
I got cats with bats you wouldn't play hardball with
I splatter intestines quick before you can blast
So handle your weapon or get splattered in a matter of seconds
And we ain't worried about threats cause God got us
We're popping Crys, y'all sipping moet byproducts
I ain't scared to die, let's die, it's gon' be either
If we both die, then your casket is gonna be cheaper
Yo you ain't a don, you don't even know what beef is
What you're competing with, or hit and make concrete give
Yo I came out making it birth, making it worse
Making a verse, sacred and shaking the earth
Niggas got plenty opinions about Royce but they ain't got a voice
I'm doper than them so they ain't got a choice
Niggas be swearing battle battle, not understanding themselves
They babble babble, that's why they stay on the shelves
Playing yourself, promising threats to test y'all
Doing this rap shit until UPS calls
I see why you must hate me, I'm sharp enough to cut gravy
It's just crazy, niggas is such babies
Real as they coming dancing, killing for fun
Advancing, the heel of my thumb feeling my gun
Cock, squeeze, make every nigga freeze in here
Stop breathing, it better be some cheese in here
If there's any MC's in here, I'm hope you read me clear
You're seeing teeth, beef with the C's in here
Yo you ain't fly, I got shit that you can't buy
Yo you can't lie, you drink St. Ides and fake high
Take pie and try to flip it, you don't know nothing about that shit
If I was you, I wouldn't risk it

[Hook]
I ain't never gon' stop hitting you hard
Rap star you know spitting triple the bars
Put your Glocks in the air and squeeze
If you got shots to share (we dare you, we dare you)
I ain't never gon' stop hitting your heart
Rap star you know spitting triple the bars
Put your Glocks in the air and squeeze
If you got shots to share (we dare you, go ahead and pull it)
I ain't never gon' stop hitting your heart
Rap star you know spitting triple the bars
Put your Glocks in the air and squeeze
If you got shots to share
