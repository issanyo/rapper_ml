[Intro: Sample]
"It is obscene, it is obscene, it is obscene."
"In 1992 the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that it was more important to ban speech that is dehumanizing to women than to protect free speech."
"Now we see the direct and indirect effects. We see the rise in murder, in abuse, in battles, teen prostitution, and teen suicide. We hear the wailing mothers, the grieving sisters, the tormented brothers and fathers, and children planning their own funeral with pink dresses and pink caskets."
"If the filth that is portrayed in these gangsta rap videos and art is not obscene then I submit that nothing is obscene."

[Verse 1]
We started off as targets
We had the Congress mad at the whole genre
Tryna get rid of us
Now it's like we not even trying to be good
It's like we just sitting ducks in the eyes of evil
I open windows with hopes that the wind blows you ten mo' blessings
Set my Timbo's next to my dresser with the  Nintendo, and yes
The extendo's on the AK 47 and it's wrapped in the dresses of En-Vogue
It's time, it's time to move something
I guess we missed our window to try to prove something
Spot a whack producer from across the room
Walk up to him, smack his hookah across the moon
Break a platinum plaque over a rapper back
Go and toss that bitch into a dark lagoon
Go into the heart of the art form with a harpoon
They ain't skilled enough to stand the field with us
You gon' have to retire me
It's only like four or five of you rappers who can actually inspire me
I be out here telling the truth
I should sign my autograph with a polygraph
I move in silence tryna get to you 'fore you could brace yourself
Cause I'm tryna put yo' ass in a body cast
Y'all niggas lollygag, not me
This evening I'm with the biggest spenders having the most prestigious dinner
You eating Church's Chicken with suspicious fictitious sinners
I'm a living legend, you a fidget spinner
I'm getting cheddar, they tryna catch up to my past M's
And I'm getting better quicker, tryna catch up and pass Em'
I be blacking out, you could ask them
Everything I spit be sick, gag phlegm
Everything I wear be tailor-made to fit, Giraffe trim
Huh, it seem like everybody out here right now wanna be 'Pac
While I'm zoning, stirring the pot
I'm 'bout to go so motherfucking Lamont Coleman
This 'bout to be disturbing to watch
While I'm out here swerving the drop
Your favorite rapper 'bout to get cleaned up, served in a box
Like laundry detergent, pushing 'round these birds with a mop
Tryna stay in a genius, creative state of mind
Tryna stay sharper than straight sharks in a 'gator pond
Grate her down, all for the greater good and the greater grind
While they denying now, all these heathens be crying 'bout
Taking care of two, three dudes but these people be lying
We keeping it G, we keeping the iron out
They feed negativity, we eating vagina while
Keeping it Zion, we turning the streets of Detroit to a D zoo
Eating while we feed people to lions
The dude that I brought with me psycho and schizo
He think that he Luke, he like to lift you and make you skywalk
You don't wanna play with none of his make-believe truth
They'll make the iron speak too
He'll do the R2D2 to your heart
Until it's parts of a easel
Threw a piece of your heart in a jar for the people
To dissect at Juilliard
I'm the best at who we are, that's fucking food for thought
Nobody else been thinking like me thus far though
Subpar cerebrals

[Interlude: Sample]
"For 400 years, profit came before principle."
"We marched for our rights to Selma, I was there with Dr. King."
"—music that glorifies and promotes violence with guns, knives, or drugs—"
"—and that includes all this gangsta rap—"
"—that's it—"
"—we march again and we're gonna keep on marching and demonstrating till it..."

[Verse 2]
I make your mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
While I'm flipping pies like Patti LaBelle, Sara Lee
Eating all the bark with Gargamel off of the cherry tree
King of the dark art, all is pale compared to me
Let the hail from the evil word flip hath fury
While hip-hop stay colorful fruity like RiFF RaFF jewelry
I enter into a different intuitiveness on instruments
I just whiplash new beats
You just the next wave to catch a crazy catchphrase
I'm just a neck brace to the next crazy contestant who should step to me, neck pain
Tell paparazzi I'm charging sales tax to media
In order to picture these digits, press will have to capture Loch Ness
On the back of a hellcat or capture a meteor
Me, I left from the frying pan like the Devil's last ingredient
While Jesus wept I made boss music flunkies relate to
Better each time I came through like I held back the previous
Look, I'm the real thing
These niggas just here to provide dangerous detail
If any of y'all MCM's is any flyer than me there
These niggas listen to sign language, probably speak braille
Me, I'm just about to stick my dick in the dirt
Either that or a model, these Ether raps are the Bible
I'm gon' relapse for a bottle or be in the absence of Godot
Relax for a throttle
One of the last living rap forefathers who wouldn't ask for a dollar
My style lethal ferocious
Streaming out your club when your single drop
Like a single drop of blood off the beak of a vulture
Uh, I broke my key off in the car door
Just as I was on my way to score a quarter key off Artmore
I'm an angel at squalor
My threshold for pain goes farther than a marine who's been ordered to war
So at 3:45, which, by the way, is a quarter to four
Somebody ask me for change for a dollar
While I spray your ass with four different fours
More layers than 44 sorting couture
Vocabulary lords sicker than Herbie's recording thesaurus
The Virgin Mary took a morning-after pill the morning before fornicating the Lord
They gave birth to me 44 days later drinking a 40 at the corner store
Therefore, this is more than just my dormitory
This is the safe place I come to look Benjamin in the face
So when you gon' end up getting ate like four and four
Icicles is made of blood-boiling water alluring gore
I'm here to combine all three Bar Exams for a fourth
While I shoot the shit as deep as foul goes though, so it's four to four
While driving a Ford wondering why guys look at me foreign for
