[Intro: Royce Da 5'9"]
That old real shit
Yo its on now
Its finally time
Niggas is ready for the lead
OK
Wall St
Royce 59
The Wise Guy
Ex Gov
VO Drive 59
Its on y'all niggas is done

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Pompous
Roll with Monsters
And down for accomplices
Nonfiction concepts constant
Bomb threat and I ain't even on yet
On spec I spit thunder and you ain't even seen the storm yet
Lightning in the clouds start a fight in the crowd
Hyper and loud get this mic in devoured spittin my style
Attack all of y'all react on the thought of y'all
Slaughter y'all im calling y'all in fact im black ballin' y'all
More vicious than an auto-pistol aimed towards rap explain fame for a shrapnel piss torque tissue
Burying the lenient under the gravel salt
The pump handle and barrel for carrying convenience
My odyssey carries the most compare me to Phoenix
Silent heart and light up a star I gotta Venus
Puddle and bomb back
Take cover and all that
And try to not die you not rugged enough
You just shook as soon I step foot in this rap shit
Im a bubble of contact like peroxide touching the cut
Stuck in my raps
Stupid Dominus
Niggas sucking my ass boosting my confidence a buck and a half
I know the game im a train trapped inside a name
And the niggas who taught me yo we ride the same
I shoot crews with the truth and chew lies of change
Speeding on a dragon in an attempt to collide with fame

[Verse 2: Ex-Gov]
Im mad so imagine my staff covered in mags and a mask
I give any nigga a half-page raft
Poisonous gas
Cutting your air off in a flash
You want to be dirty MCs and get above dat
If you ain't never heard of Ex Government ask what
Who tough you ain't bad enough to battle with us
You be crushed in the Earth dust
My verse just cuts and cause motha fuckas to spit up shit in the guts
You might wave to cats
I make a nigga bite back since you are world of rap stabber shooter
Perhaps black you smack with tracks that hurt
Act bazurk and get attacked by God Experts

[Hook]
Y'all niggas slow down its getting hot in here
Its because the real niggas getting hot and shit
We ain't playin
The death of heat will blow you away
We spit
Pray to God they ain't coming your way
We all aim thats why y'all all gotta be hit
In the knees
Snatch a knee
We Arch Nemesis
In the desert

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
What
Its too hot in the desert
I gotta be the dopest
Im hotter than Lava E Molten
Niggas that sleep gotta be violently woken
And who ever wants to get shitted on
Let do a song
I slip in the zone and rip anything with instruments on
Gonna go throw and bake what ever is out
I can do a song with bone and still have to take letters out
Grown man keep the chrome on hand
Won't stand for no shit quick to take matters into my own hands
You stop violence or violence will stop you
Got crews iller than anybody on your block do
I roll with a white boy that pop truths
Listening to rock tunes to jump in a costume and rob you
The heavy metal assassin that ignites in a full metal jacket
With sliders over the action
Heads is plammy
Facing no lyricism
With creative criticism like Headziz Pammy
If I do an album for you than you gonna die naked
You gonna be in my debt cuz you don't buy records
If your not in the dune then you need not enter
Im eating innocent crews just to feed my temper
So fuck mics
I say sick shit gets crushed on
Get a life or get the one you got tempered

[Hook]
Y'all niggas slow down its getting hot in here
Its because the real niggas getting hot and shit
We ain't playin
The death of heat will blow you away
We spit
Pray to God they ain't coming your way
We all aim thats why y'all all gotta be hit
In the knees
Snatch a knee
We Arch Nemesis
In the desert
