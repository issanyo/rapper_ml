[Verse 1]
I smoke good like a Rastaman
All around me, I'm on point like a octogon
I'm the optimum, I'mma be eating
Until my belly stick out as far as the Octo-mom's
I'm an abomination
I'm an anomaly in conversation, I'm honoring confrontation
With a dime doing dominatrix on her
Disrespect me â€“ I'll wet you like condensation, water
I'm a mixture between Chris Brown
And Chris Jericho, where's your daughter?
I'm more than y'all can handle
At the Grammy's I'll send an Indian girl to the podium
To say "No, thank you"
Like Marlon Brando for Oscars, "the Godfather"
Our father, you should praise me
I got some syphilis nunchucks wearing a AIDS gi
That mean I'm sick when I kick shit
Come to my concert get some sars on the tip of your ticket
I'm super cold
I don't spit, I shit, on your whole team
These niggas think I'm from Cleveland
It's something the way I be, dropping the Browns off at the Superbowl
Game time, nigga let's hit the sto'
And if I gave a fuck, this is where the hook would go

[Verse 2]
This is Street Hop, no rules
The rest of y'all niggas watered down like O'douls
I'm willing to do what you won't do, I'm old school
I'm a mac, I punch rappers cause I'm Pro-Tools
I hit your Pause button, I cease frontin
You don't start nothing, it still might be something
You don't want nothing? You might have something
If I go over your head, it's cause your ass ducking
Fuck the underground, I rhyme
For them fly mothafuckas that's up, that ain't tryna dumb it down
Fuck radio, fuck video
I live by the Bust' Scenario, what the dealio?
You could stop listening, right now
I'm pussy eating with bitches, I put the dyke down
Cause I'm a diamond, I'm llama rhyming, you Ramadan-in'
Simon says that in my prime I'm here
Everywhere I go it's a crime there
While you on-looking at me in the lawn chair
Cocaine, propane
I'm a living degenerate of the dope game
Relate to it, though you thought you probably couldn't
Put a face to the opposite of how the fake do it
I'm hip hop's savior, the old faithful
Sick shit, stop you off that liquid like brake fluid, this is Street Hop
