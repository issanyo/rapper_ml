[Verse 1]
We serve teardrops, prolific flow from Jamaica
Wake up, we getting that bread like a baker
Take ya life like it's nothing, boys swing
I will blood clot everything from your block
To your offspring, you not hardcore
Wouldn't crack an egg, why the fuck you acting hard boiled?
Boom bye bye is the tune I abide by
I'm aligned with goons, it's wireless like wi-fi
Why try? I'm on the cusp of greatness
You bum-ba-cluts fly, I'm on a fuckin' spaceship
Enough in the bracelet to make the blind squint
I'm Eazy, Cube, Yella, Dre, Ren times ten, I'm a (Bad Boy)

[Verse 2]
Put you in a slumber, come on bruh
You a bum, you under my umbrella, I put you in the dumpster
Whatever, I ain't the Fella who you want Roc with
I will batty boy kill ya, fuck all that dumb shit
Put you up under concrete, I'm cut like a gauntlet
Beat ya like a blum blum drum stick
Mumble something I come through dumping
AK-47 pumping, blow like a trumpet
The foolishness of niggas bullshit
Who you trying to push bitch? Booyakah, full clip, don dada
You no test me Shabba Rank impostor
You no want drama I'm prepared for 'Nam, I'm a (Bad Boy)

[Verse 3]
You're in a headlock, tie your family up like a dread lock
Gong niggas like Junior Marley when the lead drop
Eat 'em like a meal while the fed watch
You married the street I just fucked it out of wedlock
Before I rip on ya, rasta should warn ya
They don't all love ya, push needles into the eyeballs
Of a little doll of ya, blind ya, align ya
Red rum with murder for hire, serve your supplier
Pill poppin' and coke snortin'
We kill for fun 'til we come for your fortune
Bad boys, bad boys, what you gonna do?
When them killas come for you, I'm a (Bad Boy)
