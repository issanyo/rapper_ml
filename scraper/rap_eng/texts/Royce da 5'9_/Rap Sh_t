[Verse 1: Liquid Assassin]
I was born [?] to go to war with a pen
Imported from orbit my origins [?]
Tryin' to [?] every orifice distorting my oral [?]
Control me with foreign trends and [?]
These bars like something out of a brawl fight
For your death we gonna breathe on the mic and evolve life
[?] in every song that I write
No stars and stripes 'cause my only salute is to Sean Price
I do my thing in this music
The way I movin' like [?]
There's nothing to it for dudes just embrace the movement
Get brutally executed refusing music I paid my dues with
Fucking spazz on these haters
Something I had was patience
Alienated like I came from a damn spaceship
Basically landed on this planet and plantation to fix what you damaged because you rappers just can't save it

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
This ain't a pop song, this here is the basics
I'm taking these fools back to when dudes was breaking
But don't get it confused, what was in the movie Breakin'
Them niggas was confused and that movie looking [?]
Fuck you gon' dance for?
I could just [?] leave him layin' on the dancefloor
This is where I came from, stone walls [?]
Same place I got the [?] from
Bangin' Daddy Kane, DMC just to name some
Thinkin' bout Slick Rick when I get my chains done
All around the world it's the same song
[?]
Digital bootlegging no matter what you sayin'
They don't get get it no matter 'cause you payin'
I've been quiet I had to tie up some loose ends
The world wide web is my new friend
Yeah
