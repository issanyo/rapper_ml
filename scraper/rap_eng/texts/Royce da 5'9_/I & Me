[Intro: Woman talking]
Royce is goin to fuckin kill you

[Royce da 5’9” imitating 2Pac]
Ha, true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Yeah, up in the studio gettin blowed
Truest shit I ever spoke

[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9”]
How can I go from rockin with Dre to fallin out
With Shady to poppin' my Glock on the block to droppin on Koch!
Mistakes that I've made, I've learned to regret
Impatiently we blazin them AK's, to earn the respect
I done been in the trenches for years, in this rap shit
Where my name is mention is fear, compared to that shit
I done paid my dues, I done learned more from my mistakes
Then I done learned in any grade in my school
I could have made you today, I could raise ya brow
On a label that's foul or on a Major with radio play
I can guide myself, through the game myself
Give you the chills, kill hip hop and save myself
I learned to behave myself, people choose sides when
They figure you die, I learned they take away my wealth
All these niggas that used to page me, everyday that I dealt
But they all gone, y'all wrong, I page myself, because

[Hook: Royce da 5’9”]
I do this music for me, I take time and put pride in it
This music is me, it's no ruinin' me
I'm the truest MC, as hot as you need me to be, as cool as can be
If you was true as me, then this for you, but I do it for I
I do this music for me, I take time and put pride in it
This music is me, it's no ruinin me
I'm the truest MC, as hot as you need me to be, as cool as can be
If you was true as me, then this for you, but I do it for me

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
Every breath that I breathe, every second I have
To be in the lab, with young man, makin' a track at least
In the basement, rappin in peace, patiently waiting
To blow up and grow up, back and away from this rappin beef shit
All of that should cease, cause I feel like quittin
Back to the factory, rap for ME, when I feel like spittin
Go out and kill a clown a day, don't call me Royce no more
It's Ryan, I just threw Detroit's crown away!
It's only so many times, I could let my temper get tested
I can't handle it, I'll eventually get arrested
I'm on the verge of doin some things, that won't help - shit!
Take myself away from my family, is so selfish
I can't help shit, lately I been ignorin rules
You takin care of too many people, to go and lose
(I) do my music and speak truly, without the influence of movies
Or these fools in the streets that wanna do me, nigga

[Hook: Royce da 5’9”]
I do this music for me, I take time and put pride in it
This music is me, it's no ruinin' me
I'm the truest MC, as hot as you need me to be, as cool as can be
If you was true as me, then this for you, but I do it for I
I do this music for me, I take time and put pride in it
This music is me, it's no ruinin me
I'm the truest MC, as hot as you need me to be, as cool as can be
If you was true as me, then this for you, but I do it for me

[Royce da 5’9” imitating 2Pac]
True motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Yeah, up in the studio gettin blowed
Truest shit I ever spoke
Yeah, hopin you true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Yeah, up in the studio gettin blowed
Truest shit I ever spoke
