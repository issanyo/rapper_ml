It's all hectic, you can't trust a mother
[?] business

[Verse 2: Young Product]
They like my bitch on some bullshit, tryna fuck up the love
No I can't pull a OJ, hands can't fit in a glove
Why my family disowned me like they left me for dead?
It got me spinnin' in circles, I got my hands on my head
What the fuck goin' on? If they right were they wrong?
They got your boy feeling weak still I gotta be strong
Gotta keep vision clear and learn to play my position
[?] think what you don't know, that's the bitchin' tuition
I'm screaming 'fuck the world,' it's not a game
And they got me going crazy but still I'm sane
[?] runnin', got me thinkin' 'bout jumpin'
I mean like right over a bridge, don't give a fuck about nothin'
So tired of the bullshit, the critics, the fakes

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
I keep that gun in my gear, who tryna front on me where?
You actin' crazy this year, act like there's gum in yo hair
[?] sick thoughts, eat a dick bitch, get lost
The light bulbs ceiling at my crib but piss off Chris Bosh
Uh, yeah I'm 'bout to go crazy
At the Gucci store, you 'bout to go to Old Navy
On that funny shit, lying on your gun and dick
I keep it one-hundred, y'all keep it twenty-six
Nickel's the name, grippin' the pistol became
My way of life when I came outside of my mommas insane asylum vagina
I paid dues, the game gave me back my change in diamonds
It's ironic I came inside of your dame inside of the Cayman Islands
I'm one of the greats fool, the only thing
That me and Michael Jordan don't got in common is I don't fake moves
Y'all niggas get zero action, the temperature of my chamber's zero
Everywhere we go we shine: Tito Jackson

[Hook: Young Product]
Yeah, I'm 'bout to go crazy
Yeah, I'm 'bout to go crazy
Yeah, I'm 'bout to go crazy
Yeah, I'm 'bout to go crazy
