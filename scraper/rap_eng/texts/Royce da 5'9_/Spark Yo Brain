[Verse 1]
Spark yo brain
Shot will fly and y'all will feel the pain
Spark yo brain
A baby boy will never be the same
Spark yo brain
I will use this torch or resort to fisticuffs
Spark yo brain
After that I'mma put my dick in your bitch's butt
Spark yo brain
I will come to the studio and shoot you bitches up
Spark yo brain
Fuck all the confoolary niggas my tools are liften up

Tiger Ty just dissed me, mem mem mem
I ain't mean to offend you, mem mem mem
But you ain't want it with me,  mem mem me mem mem
I leave you blacker then rusherly, mem, mem, mem
Let me rap

If you a thug you and you connected
I’ll run up on you with the tech and pull the plug
My recipe is drug I was made out cane, hundred million dollar brain
Down to ride for the team, homicide everyday
I've been showing no remorse, or recourse
I’m 'bout to fuck an ugly whore in Shreveport
You can bring any opponent, I will kidnap his wife
Mail a ring finger to him with the ring still on it
I should flow this to the toilet, you're the type of nigga
To keep the sticker on your foot lock to show you just bought it
Fake nigga, I'm from the AK state
With the Great Lakes, the home of the late, great, Dilla
Keep that rhythm just like us ticking
Picture [?] written like a bomber
Put money on your momma, I'm a Shady nigga
I put money on the gardener and the babysitter
And if Im'ma bait a nigga, Im'ma reel him and I'll sink him
I'm ill with this motherfucking ink pen
If you ain't noticed, I'm the motherfucking coldest
You don't want to go and get heroic, I fig this four is tofigure four it

Spark yo brain
Cause you don't want to end up on the BE3, you bitch
Spark yo brain
Them groupies know that when it come to me, it's easy dick

I put money on your head, mem, mem, mem, mem
I put money on your head, mem, mem, mem, mem
I put money on your head, mem, mem, mem, mem
Mem, mem, mem, mem mem, mem, mem, mem
I put money on your head, mem, mem, mem, mem
I put money on your head, mem, mem, mem, mem
I put money on your head, mem, mem, mem, mem
Mem, mem, mem, mem mem, mem, mem, mem

Mem, mem, mem, mem
