[Verse 1: Twigg Martin]
I came in the game want'n more paper than Puff
Now I realize Puff paper ain't enough
Now I realize Hov paper ain't enough
So my foot up on the pedal tryin' meddle with these bucks
'til the death of me, 'til ain't nothin' left of me
Gettin' money, fuckin' hoes nigga that's the recipe
Dream filthy pedigree
Niggas can't step with me, apparently
Canons like the armory allegedly
You better have line when you see me about that power shit
Ain't no IOU, fuck that vowel shit
Brought my dogs hungry send 'em to devour shit
Send em for your lunch, for your dinner, or ??? shit
You ain't 'bout this life, where's your manuscript?
I'm the front of the bike, boy I just handle it
I ain't one of them tykes, boy I'm a big dog
I run in your bitch like a project vestibule after me stretchin' you
Unless she ask me what's next to do
I'm Jesus Christ descended bitch, I'm just blessin' you
I ain't runnin' with bitches or fraud niggas
Better yet, I ain't runnin' at all, nigga
The bigger you are, harder you fall, nigga
And I don't think you gonna live to recall, nigga
The sound track to my life to y'all niggas
Truthfully I'm just livin' to ball, nigga
Look here, statutory on the track, no rufee
Hashtag, motherfucking I so you me
Eyes on the prize, let the success grew me
Pardon me, the success might get to me
If you don't like it, fuck you, bitch sue me
I reside in the top don't need a roomie
Shit, I don't need no curtains on it
Bitches call me king twin while I'm squirtin' on it
Doc martin in the flesh, get the surgeon on it
Punch in and punch out, I'm just workin' on it
Oh you niggas is memories took the shotgun
You niggas broke with a pen ??? vodka
Boy I got the juice, I'm the motherfuckin' truth
My startin' line 3.5 this five dimes equivalent high times
Burnin' down with neon lights
A prime time still tryin' to fuck Dion White before 5 9
Hey yo 5 9

[Spoken: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yup! Who you talkin' about? Pilar?

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
I came into this game not needin' too much paper
Just a mic and a dream then I ignited the scene
Never wore a backpack much but when I did
I had steel in it big as the deal I had
If y'all openin' act niggas act hard at our raps
Shit, perhaps you can get the gat all access
We flippin' yao pack like Pacquiao backwards
And we gon' tax y'all like Pacquiao taxes
I got a million dollar pissy ass mattress in the backyard
Behind a mansion next to a black car
That I bought with a black card
That's charge, we 'bout to bring back bars
Look on that logo on that Rolls Royce, that's ours
I been a spaz, I spend a bad bitch for the dinner tab in the rain and send cab, it's a shame
Who bullets ain't got names?
I'm shootin' 762s big enough to fit the first, middle and the last
Who wanna talk gun talk?
My guns talk loud as a perm, out of turn as Trinidad James
I handle business, banana clip animalistic
I put my hands around your mama throat and twist it
Until I hear it pop like I'm opening up a grocery store can of biscuits
Then send your chick a random dick pic
You like a semi to spit and you missed me
You Abe Lincoln on a penny, you in a cent and you history

Talk is cheap
