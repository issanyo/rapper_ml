[Intro: Woman & Royce Da 5'9"]
I know you see me calling him
Yo what's up, you reached 3-1-3-7-8-9-0-5-0-9
Be nice bitch, be nice
I ain't around, leave a message
Hey baby I know you're busy, I just want to see how you were and see what you're doing, I know you're in the studio. I'm about to go out with my girls, but if you need me to do anything, call me. Okay? I love you, muah, muah, muah

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Me and my baby started out like two peas in a pod
Me and my baby, nothing can come between she and I
That's my lil misses, little fly, little chick, thick little thighs
Everything I'm into, she alright with it
And she on tip, she on mine
I'mma slide right in, get in her mind cause she's a keeper
Any time she's with me, nah, she ain't gotta lift a finger
She ain't gotta spend a dime, she around me all the time
Cause she's so cool, even my friends don't mind
That's my lil misses, always so calm, always so kind

[Hook 1: K-Young]
Lil misses on my mind, misses on my mind
I look forward to her call, I enjoy when you talking
Lil misses on my mind

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
She never waste my time when she on my line
She stay on my mind
Oh my God when she blow me
She blow me good, it blow my mind
I'm on tour right now, now she texting me saying
I was out doing ecstasy, molly and coke with four of my girls
And I think I gotta throw up and go and lie down
I look at my phone like wow
I think about all the Patron I downed
Maybe that's your business, no judgement here
Baby that's your lifestyle
She said, "I'm so glad you not mad"
I said "No my doll, but I gotta get to stage right now
But please be careful hanging with the all night crowd."

[Hook 2: K-Young]
My lil misses on my mind, misses on my mind
Hanging out, poppin' pills, now she sniffin', now she's real
Caught me trippin' on my line

[Interlude: Woman & Royce Da 5'9"]
You reached 3-1-3-7-8-9-0-5-0-9
Ugh
I ain't around, leave a message
Baby, call me, I'm high haha

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
I came back from tour, she done got skinny with acne
She got her hair dyed blond and it's up in a bun
Her ass is flat and it's gone
I asked what the fuck was happening
She reached up and tried to slap me
(No, ahhh!)
I slipped and she missed it
And then ran in the bathroom and slammed the door
I was like, hell you alright?
All I heard through the screaming
Was something about me following chicks on Snapchat
And her having pics of me and her in the sack last
And she 'bout to go sell it to a site
She even told me she already sent an email to my wife
Damn, my lil misses blackmailing me and shit
I guess she fell for the hype

[Hook 3: K-Young]
My lil misses on my mind, misses on my mind
You completely switched into another bitch
So now I got a psycho mistress on my line

[Verse 4: Royce Da 5'9"]
For some reason i believed the bitch
Best thing I could do is
Tell my wife before my wifey see the shit
Maybe I can loosen her up
By taking her on a vacation or skiing trip
Maybe I can lean in for a kiss and plead the fifth
Damn, shit was all good just a week ago
Until we hit a fever  pitch
Now I gotta go on my phone and delete the bitch
Then I get a text saying "I'm pregnant and I'm keeping it
I'mma get my child support
And I plan on paying my lease with it
You ain't never gotta worry about hearing from me again"

[Interlude 2: Woman & Royce Da 5'9"]
Aye what up this is Royce I'm away from my phone for at least two weeks, I'm on a family trip with my wife and kids. Please leave a message
You didn't tell me about no family trip. Fuck that bitch, fuck your family, Ryan I need you to call me

[Outro]
It was all good, just a week ago, yeah
I understood and I played my role
It was all good, just a week ago, yeah
I understood and now I am alone, yeah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Call me
What would Lincoln's bitch ass do at a time like this?
Shit, I'mma answer my damn phone
