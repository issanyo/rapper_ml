[Intro]
Welcome to the future
You rockin' with Royce da 5'9"
The year is 3000, yeah
We gonna get hype, hot hot rock rock

[Chorus]
There he is with another hit
Hot hot
All the kids in the gutter get
Rock rock
Cause I spit nothing other than
Hot hot
And if you want that other shit
Stop stop
There he is with another hit
Hot hot
All the kids in the gutter get
Rock rock
Cause I spit nothing other than
Hot hot
And if you want that other shit
Stop stop

[Verse 1]
Yo I'm hot hot
Spittin' in mics like jock box
On top, like as precise as a stop watch
Cypher of lights, bright lights, nice tights
Eye sights on tight writes like five mics
Next source, next door to Hector
Lex sport, next tour it effects more
You small time
You're money is all mine
Easy money
Half of these cats is all blind
Get split, rip hits with Rick Swift
Sixth sense, don't forget what you're chick spent
Control mine, gold mine
Never sold mine its show time
Broke his nose with a clothes line
Next club check stub from ex gov
Flex love on a track that's a test of
On a max sale just so the snare snap well
(What does this mean?)
Who cares? As long as the track sell

[Chorus]
There he is with another hit
Hot hot
All the kids in the gutter get
Rock rock
Cause I spit nothing other than
Hot hot
And if you want that other shit
Stop stop
There he is with another hit
Hot hot
All the kids in the gutter get
Rock rock
Cause I spit nothing other than
Hot hot
And if you want that other shit
Stop

[Verse 2]
Stop it
Lock it with another rhyme topic
Big crew that I flock with
Resting in gothic
Buildings
180 degree ceilings
Stealing, push ya grill in
Secret compartment to conceal in
Feelin'
Get in where you fit in
Half freestyle, half written
Heads spinning
Rhymes submitted in two minutes
I said women
Is you with me?
Nah black, I said women
Floss rollies, goldies
Leaving ya lof holy
Lost totally
To get it across goalie
Big boys, big toys
Big poys, big boys
Oops.. I meant big noise
Half rap, half act
Rap act say I rap wack
Black mac for a half bag
Too crude
Took your crew jewels with two roo
Too rude, wearing the legendary blue shoes
Third, one-third, one slur
Sun splurred off of the top to cop one fur
Black male in the form of a crack sale
(What are you talkin' about?)
Who cares? As long as the track sells

[Chorus]
There he is with another hit
Hot hot
All the kids in the gutter get
Rock rock
Cause I spit nothing other than
Hot hot
And if you want that other shit
Stop stop
There he is with another hit
Hot hot
All the kids in the gutter get
Rock rock
Cause I spit nothing other than
Hot hot
And if you want that other shit
Stop

[Verse 3]
Wrong move, wrong dude, song's cued
Long uze, counter-attack for Kung Fu
Lace beats, escape heat, face me
Put up your dukes, I shoot
I play cheat
Foreplay in your doorway
It's my forte, four legs
Doing it the mature way
Savvy leaving tragedies in the alley
Casualties, then mashin' out in the navvy
Black Lugz, gats plug, take back thugs
Snatch Bugz
Act thug then get a back rub
Show you, blow you through your snow roof
Reach under your seat for heat b, there's no use
Seven seal, I'm set with eleven mil
I expect the real or expect a check that I haven't filled
Fearing faces whenever I appear in places
One ear and out the other then you hearin' naythin'
Sore losers get mad at the four cruisers
Traders hate that I made it before Judas
Rap hell to a brotha who rap well
(What you doin' man?)
Who cares?  As long as the track sell

[Chorus]
There he is with another hit
Hot hot
All the kids in the gutter get
Rock rock
Cause I spit nothing other than
Hot hot
And if you want that other shit
Stop stop
There he is with another hit
Hot hot
All the kids in the gutter get
Rock rock
Cause I spit nothing other than
Hot hot
And if you want that other shit
Stop
There he is with another hit
Hot hot
All the kids in the gutter get
Rock rock
Cause I spit nothing other than
Hot hot
And if you want that other shit
Stop stop
There he is with another hit
Hot hot
All the kids in the gutter get
Rock rock
Cause I spit nothing other than
Hot hot
And if you want that other shit
Stop stop
