[Chorus]
Hold on, all you gotta do is hold on
There is no failure in God

[Verse 1: Ty Farris]
Vibrations from my adolescences
No second guess I was grabbing weapons
Aiming at these niggas tryna snatch my blessings
Never been a punk I had to pass the message
Long as I'm around my competition trapped in second
The devil trying to get to me
Malicious moments marinating in my memory
When I'm gone hopefully the world will remember me
This pen help dodge the penalty of the penitentiary
This corny industry ah have you enemies
Death sentence if you dissing me
Distance myself from niggas
Yeah i be the rebel
I'm in a zone like I'm playing ball at the collegiate level
River dancing with demons dodging em them on the daily
Its crazy maybe it made me a maniac, in a Raiders hat
You relate to that?
A nigga with an attitude lost half his screws
Half the time my dad in a halfway house, so the streets raised me
But now im focus and hopefully nothing goes wrong
Hold my head high, ya boy Ty tryna hold on

[Chorus]
Hold on, all you gotta do is hold on
There is no failure in God

[Verse 2: Ty Farris]
This lifestyle is hereditary, yeah its extra scary
The sidewalk stay looking like niggas just stepped on cherries
Holy matrimony under the mattress is a magazine
The source is filled with a hot 16 that ah snatch ya dreams
Hope it don't come to that
My offense is a defense
Yall ride the radio waves till ya sea sick
See the situations will never change
If its embedded in ya brain
That the only way to get fame
Is become a slave to this game
It's a shame
Meanwhile my fans trying to find a vein
They fiending for the flow and fortunately I provide the kane
My life ain't perfect its no reason for me to hide the pain
Won't sell my soul or compromise my morals just to sign my name
Came from nothing, the gutter that's what i rep until the death of me
Proof changed my life the night he message me
Told me be a father to my daughter
I was holding her at the time
Rest in peace my nigga i love, i'm still focus on my grind

[Chorus]
Hold on, all you gotta do is hold on
There is no failure in God

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9]
Uh, Grandmomma gone man I'm alone
Pay cash for the house, climb on the roof stand on my own
Hand on my phone in a phantom on chrome
I'm flabbergasted by who I'm actually speaking with
Seems like just last week I was just trapped in a deep abyss
Ratchet squeezing pleading the fifth
Now i kick it with divas
Leave ya chick with me its go be a
Masterpiece theathe
I'm go be Master P
She go be looking cash to me
Even though its actually cheaper to keep her
Just as quick as the season switch
I went from squeezing the beeper to squeezing clips
We ill rash
My legion is sick
Pledging thee allegiance to liters and fifths
Enemies become chicken fingers they meet us and dip
We the best in this business
Yall ah just be statistic
Calling yourselves tryna beat us at this
No luck
Used to worry bout getting tongue from a bitch
Now I just be making bitches give my Adidas a kiss
Sho nuff

[Chorus]
Hold on, all you gotta do is hold on
There is no failure in God
Hold on, all you gotta do is hold on
There is no failure in God
