"Say it again"

[Verse 1] [Wale]
Uh huh
Slumdog far apart any sub par
The underdog of the underground has come far
Who's gonna come for it?
The crown that is
They gun for it
But wouldn't blow if George Jung wrote it
I cough on the chorus, sneeze on that loose leaf napkin
Nigga my loogies eat tracks up
That why my fan base adds up
HBC bitches need a nigga like FAFSA's
Like I took a tablet of melatonin
See, while y'all niggas on the microphone I'm nappin'
Nigga, I'm the baddest and I ain't even trappin'
I master vandalism and my Louie V's sprouse shit
How the fuck a deal matter
I still keep it indie, y'all worried the Dow slim
Cry me a river, I'll white water raft it
Y'all roll up pounds well I roll up mountains
I rode from Largo to south side to Austin
With a bad snow bunny probably still on allowance

[Hook: Wale]
"Say it again"
I ain't hear you clear
Stuntin' in my rarest pair
Nigga I ain't never scared
"Say it again"
Call me whatever Joe
I be gettin' money
Motherfucker I ain't never broke
"Say it again"
I ain't hear you clear
Stuntin' in my rarest pair
Nigga I ain't never scared
"Say it again"
Call me whatever Joe
Wale & Royce
Motherfucker this is forever dope

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm like castration
Take your balls from ya
Pause
I'm calculatin'
Like numbers
We lookin' for something like navigation
Lyrically force niggas to spit it like masturbation
Physically molly whoppin'
Triggers is probably poppin'
All of my bitches mind's are Free like Olly Oxen
Suck my lolly pop then
I put the condom on it
Look at the beaver up and down like I'm Wally watchin'
Haha, I'm on the grind, niggas know the time
You spit it like phew
I spit it like a loaded nine, POP
Biggie...PAC
C'mon, who's nicer than Nickel?
I'm fried from this ripple
And you a big dummy like Lamont Sanford
Your life is a product of trash
I'm fuckin' dykes with a lot of pizzazz
My hoes got moxie
My Slaughter's hittin' our goals as though we like hockey
My nigga Wale
