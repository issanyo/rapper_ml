[Skit]
And now for a brief intermission, feel free to:
Smoke some weed
Do some coke
Drink some Henny
Go to the strip club
You can tip a bitch
Um, get your money from your whores
You can read a book
You can, um, drink a beer

People in the hood don't drink beers anymore. They haven't drank beer since the 70s. And get a haircut? But getting a haircut is not very gangster. Not during an intermission, you don't get a fucking haircut. You do coke, or drink a beer, or smoke weed, or fuck a bitch. You don't fucking get a haircut. And haircut takes 4 hours. Choke a bitch? Okay, yeah, but choke a bitch is kinda 2005
