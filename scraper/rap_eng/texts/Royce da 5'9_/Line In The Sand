[Intro]
My nigga King Los just tweeted out he the best
Cyhi know he the best?
My nigga Ab-Soul say he the best
And even though I think these guys are three of the freshest, ever
I look at opinions like I look at lickin' an asshole, I respectfully disagree with that

[Refrain]
Bar Exam, where is the competition?
Bar Exam, where is the competition?
Bar Exam, where is the competition?
(There is no competition)

[Verse 1]
I like guns more, you the type to knife
I'm more the candy paint type, you more the Mike and Ike
I'm from the 'Mo, I'm more the type to drive the Ghost tonight like I'm the Poltergeist
Embracin' crime like I'm supposed to die
The face of crime, like I'm the closing eye's poster guy
I'm more the type to hold the door, I'm nice
Call me "so polite", dawg you Molson Ice
Prototype of pulverizing mics, avoid life's
Rollercoaster ride through polarizing alcoholic lows and highs
I'm more the type to go incite the riot
Throw hollows and watch them go in your body as though they got invited
Not of this Earth trying to be godly of death cause I was Gotti at birth
Might as well write a lot of these verses while I'm inside of a hearse
Take your broad, show her more than just a front door and call that shit Lurch
Prolly gonna be the first artist to add a body to his body of work
My discography just like a map to rapper body bags
Now process that, I might just drop a track where Jim Hoffa at

[Intro Refrain]

[Verse 2]
We can agree to disagree, we can leave it at that, or we can bet
Even if smack ain't got the fee correct
Any supposedly ill rapper can get it for free
Feared, revered rappers, Lupe Fiasco, tweet or text
Hand on the Desert Eagle squeezing the reapers neck
We can go for broke til things get repossessed
We can flow for keeps, go til either one of us slumped over the speaker dead
You takin a decease in that,  I'm hoping to be the next
Greatest of all time, while these hard lines shake up the web
You facin' an ethernet
And no this ain't no Kendrick Control move
This just a flow that never gets old, Malinda Williams in Soul Food
How could you Violate somebody who got Chris Lighty wisdom, who never bluff
Them twin rifles is coming out looking like Blue Ivy siblings, better trust
Everything on your mind that be on your lap like private dancers trappin
I'll put three in your cap, it's not a good time to try and chance the rapper
Nah, I'm old school, still trying to dance with Patra
Hoes finding Vanity from The Last Dragon tryin' to romance the master
You need to hire a yes man to talk you off your competitve edge
My foot on the ledge tripping on all these woulda been, coulda been, shoulda been terrace(?)
Nobody round this bitch is better than me
You the competition? Only props I'll give is you bout good as dead
I don't do memes and bickering, I see you out swing for the fences
I don't like coonin' unless you Mary Blige singing for chicken
Y'all hopeless, every time y'all spit it I just envision lies
The gods focus, I ball doper than Lamar Odom already wishin' a nigga would
Like Charles Oakley, in the Wizard of Oz
My niggas got they rags and sticks in the sky, like they hitchin' a ride
Uh, I'm sitting here counting this grip cuz I be standing for change
This bigger than any kind of redemption this is Andy Dufresne
The flyest nigga livin' reside inside the land of the fame
Birthday instead of cake, I keep a pie lit like I'm landin' a plane
Bar Exam 4, this is the "There is No Competition Edition", my nigga
Bar Exam 4, this is the "There is No Competition Edition", my nigga
Bar Exam 4, this is the "Where is the Competition Edition", my nigga
Bar Exam 4, this is the "Where in the Fuck is the Competition", nigga
