[Intro]
I paint a smile on my face
But my mind’s in a different place

[Hook]
They only see the light, but look behind the camera
And then you’ll find an answer on the other side
Look closer, you will find a message for the dreamer
The grass ain’t always greener on the other side

[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9”]
I don’t give a fuck about no rapper, anyone will cap’ya
Everyone is capable of murder if they have to
Anyone can sell drugs, anyone can do time
You trivial niggas, all you do is confuse crime
Rappers are held is such a high regard, why we fall?
It’s ‘cause we forget the fans are the reason why we’re stars
The fans also are not perfect, keep in mind
Not to treat me like a science project and not a person
I lend my respect to the game ‘cause it teach you wisdom
Your friends expect you to change, so they treat you different
Through all my fame in my life I have grown
If my wife decide that she gone, I might wanna die alone
I'mma be honest ‘cause every rapper alive
Including I, puts a persona up
But I promise what you seein’ has truly been me
But I ain’t 5’9” all the time, sometimes I’m just Ryan - a human being

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
I can’t believe she hopped in homie whip
My boo got blinded by the chromy lip
And all that dough he get that he would blow and trick
On open toes to rock with all the clothes she pick
Dim lit restaurants with the Kobe dish
Then neck the Moe' he sip
Man, you ain’t even like champagne, you little phony bitch
You on homie dick
Look at you walking in them heels like they Sauconys bitch
God this is crap, I mean holy shit
I took you in when you got knocked up
Argue with your moms about why I'mma fuck your pops up
Grave yard shift, liftin’ a box up, ain’t wanna risk being locked up
I just wanted to be a good pops, but
You took my son like he was only yours
We used to go to war on the phone, you had no remorse
You're cold, your heart shivering
You was on an arm of a artist but that's just women when...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Lately I’m somber, my relationship with karma
Got me peeling at my skin wishing I was made of armor
Shady, I’m honored, thanks for taking in this monster
Deeper than this stab wound given by my baby momma
Trying to figure if I fear love
Or if the devil got him in some type of bear hug that I’m not aware of
Just cope do what works for you
I’m prettier inside, trying to be reversible
I mean moms never changed, never hurt her view
So when she go, so do I, make that hearse for two
I feel my heart and I'm reminded it's cold
They say our bodies gonna perish and our spirits will be assigned new trolls
So if you was climbing with Joe, when it’s my time to go
Fuck a funeral, get out there and find my soul
Cause alone I’d break
I need y’all to help prove that I’m not just God’s lone mistake

[Hook]
