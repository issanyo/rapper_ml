[Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, Pro Logic
It's your man Nickel by the way
My motherfuckin' brother Joell Ortiz, Omar LinX
The real Hip Hop, let's go

Verse 1 [Omar LinX]
They don't believe it
They beef and they say I'm so conceited
No introduction needed I eat through the fuckin' speaker
The voice of reason it teach me between right and wrong
Kill 'em all, send 'em home, I just can't get along
You out your mind, you must be outta your head
You couldn't stand in my place if I invited you in
Fuck it don't even stand close
Know that I'm the last hope
Love me when I'm gone, shit
I'll be on my Van Gogh

They can't handle the boy, homie admit it
I raise Hell for a living but goddamn it I did it, yeah
That's how I build my way up from the cuttin' floor
With nothing but the hustle and hunger of wantin' somethin' more

With no schoolin' just the varsity to look cool and
Matching kicks, backpack with the jet through it (?)
Just let it be, don't gotta try so hard
I'm a beast I can show you where the wild things are, like

[Chorus - Omar LinX]
They don't believe we're in charge
But you can say I said it (say I said it)
And ya'll can save the applause cus I don't want the credit
If they don't like it, it's fine they all gon' pay it in time
So I'm just letting you know, until I see you in Hell

They don't believe we're in charge
But you can say I said it (say I said it)
And ya'll can save the applause cus I don't want the credit
If they don't like it, it's fine they all gon' pay it in time
So I'm just letting you know, until I see you in Hell

Verse 2 [Royce Da 5'9"]
You little scoundrels ain't brash
You better be out
You better bounce before you write a check your ass can't cash

Me? I let it do what it do
You? You would just sue
I would turn your whole crew to a human canoe
I'm on that enemy diet
I be eating your homies till I rise like the center of balogna when you fry it
Lungs full of oxygen when he's tired
In the future I could pop 'em and then he's prior (?)

Even though I wouldn't put it past you
I'm letting you know it's going down like toilet water in the public bathroom
Guns, guns, 3 niggas better than me in this game
And their names are none, none, and none

My man Moss gave the handoff
We can bet the usual dollar we better like Motora (??) and Randolph
But we ain't tradin' places
When I say I'm takin' any charge you got in tradin' cases
I mean with AK's'es

[Chorus - Omar LinX]
They don't believe we're in charge
But you can say I said it (say I said it)
And ya'll can save the applause cus I don't want the credit
If they don't like it, it's fine they all gon' pay it in time
So I'm just letting you know, until I see you in Hell

They don't believe we're in charge
But you can say I said it  (say I said it)
And ya'll can save the applause cus I don't want the credit
If they don't like it, it's fine they all gon' pay it in time
So I'm just letting you know, until I see you in Hell

Joell Ortiz
Verse 3 [Joell Ortiz]
Oh word? You the realest gangsta?
You's a killa ain't ya
You a tequila wankster

Need that fluid in you to say that you shoot a pistol
Two hand touch the only time that you threw a missile
If I toot a whistle baby your crew is gristle
Shoot up like a fat kid when his food's official

I see ya talking, but I don't see ya walkin
I got congested sunglasses I can see ya coughing
I used to keep a heater often and squeeze a portion
If you ran you had Red Sox like the team in Boston
But I don't glorify it, I hide it - you forcify it
From here on y'all can't eat, y'all on a water diet
That's from the force of trying, taste that lead in it
If it was beef it would seem like you dipped your head in it
I'm from where tomorrow ain't definite
Over peanuts you get found in a trunk, little elephant

[Chorus - Omar LinX]
They don't believe we're in charge
But you can say I said it (say I said it)
And ya'll can save the applause cus I don't want the credit
If they don't like it, it's fine they all gon' pay it in time
So I'm just letting you know, until I see you in Hell

They don't believe we're in charge
But you can say I said it  (say I said it)
And ya'll can save the applause cus I don't want the credit
If they don't like it, it's fine they all gon' pay it in time
So I'm just letting you know, until I see you in Hell
