[Verse 1]
Uh, they say the clock's tickin'
Mines is under my bed, yeah, that's where I keep it
I'm just layin' next to some edible vagina
I'm tryin' to show this bitch that I get better over time
I hope you know a gentleman issue dependin' on his mood
He'll throw a few scraps to his ratchet fam
Then get in a suit, hat and go clap at you
While you at your dinner, oh, that's classic, man
I'm givin' passes in exchange for weight
And by "passes", I mean gastric, fam
By "pass", I mean I'll pass cause these niggas groupies, tran
They givin' roofies to fans
I'd rather invite over Karrueche Tran
Answer the door wit' some Lil' Boosie playin'
We ain't really hearin' you niggas sittin' on dubs
I got my ear to your car window
I still don't understand what do you be sayin'
Could you please move that lil' piece of shit out the way
So I could take the piss?
By the way, what are y'all competin' for?
If I could just be honest, my wifey fuckin' gorgeous
And if I ain't fuckin' Rihanna, then what the fuck I'm cheatin' for?
If this movie I'm living's for your viewin' pleasure
Then I can't really be no whore
Cause they don't make 'em like me no more

[Chorus]
They don't make 'em like me no more
Yeah, that's opportunity knockin'
I'm standin' where it might be your door
To say to you that they don't make 'em like me no more

[Verse 2]
May God bless anyone against this conquest
Y'all hire muscle like I'm pressed
Like I ain't out here walkin' 'round like I'm a one-man arm press
I'm just in the zone
I said, "Less talk", not "Let's talk", let's just get it on
Who the best out right now? Just get 'em on the phone
Tell him I don't want much
I just want to tell him that I plan to come and kill him
I'm a probably talk to him soft like Liam Neeson
Like I'm bein' decent
I'm PRhyme, I'm Slaughterhouse, I'm BME
I'm sort of like 'Pac in the vest, I got no fear in me
Cause I done been to hell and back so many times
That I think I'd seen the smile on the face of the reaper
So don't waste your time prayin' to your creator
Too late, he can't make ya like me, bruh

[Chorus]
Nah, they don't make 'em like this no more
That's opportunity knockin'
I'm standin' there like this your door
To say to them that they don't make 'em like this no more

[Verse 3]
This ain't the standard ops you niggas done ran across
I'll send my little man across the street
He'll stop squeezin' 'til somethin' pops into your head
Like a random thought, I don't care for drama
I'd rather terrorize you, chase you 'round your city
Like you Sarah Connor and I'm the Terminator
I'm wearin' Ferragamo the same time that the devil's wearin' Prada
Why would you and I compare albums?
I got your life in the palm of my hands
Layin' it down is all I'm thinkin' 'bout
And newsflash, niggas is frauds, it's all an act
When he tough wit' the talk
He don't go out in traffic, he know I'll slap him
He know I'll snatch him out of that box he lives in he calls Abby
You know I'll stuff him back in that box
That I put niggas in called casket
It ain't nothin' to squash, don't call my line wit' that wack shit
You want to get to the bottom of that? Call catfish
Now let me get back to what I was doin'
This hundred-round drum turns around time in mixed months
Same Valentine's day massacre, March Madness
Wrapped in a big blunt, let's smoke the niggas who really live it
Who know what beef really is and don't speak if it really isn't
Got niggas doin' life in the prison on the iPhone and the corrlinks
And I live in the no-fly zone
And more digits is all that I got my eyes on
I see you clowns through the eyes of the Lord
I'm lookin' down knowin' I'll be around for your rise and your fall
You rhyme, what's more mind-blowin' than a 9 to your jaw?
Even a weak flow could be nice
I'm takin' penitentiary chances
We roll the dice like the Migos in Vice
You want these hoes and likes
Me? I'm the one there'll be no one like
