[Verse One: Nottz]
Come on blast that (blast that)
Yeah blast that (blast that)
Turn it up until your eardrums bust out
Act up and I'ma show you what it be 'bout
Niggas got plans of dancing, better re-route
Headbanger shit, we orangutans bitch
We don't swing from no trees but we got the banana clip
The people overseas, yeah they fuck with the boy
Say the boy brings 'bout joy
He's so special
Short bus special
Where my safety helmet at
Class A guitar, hear that banging in the back
(Damn he going crazy)
See that boy neck snap?
Back to the white meat, and doc can't fix that
Needless to say I'm certified with the boom bap
Bump this in your stereo, pour it in your cereal
Early in the morning and you mad cause you know black
You motherfucker ain't used to real rap

[Hook: Nottz]
All my motherfuckers in the hood
Blast that shit
Po po they turn it down but you
Blast that shit
Real niggas know what it [?]
Blast that shit
[?]
Blast that shit
[?]
Blast that shit
[?]
Blast that shit
[?]
Blast that shit
Oh it's real hip hop you got to...
Blast that
Blast that

[Verse Two: Black Milk]
Yo and this is what y'all been waiting for
Black the antidote to catapult niggas out
Into a distance, animal cannibal, is this
Hannibal eat and I never been a fan of yo'
Shit when I got my nigga Nottz here
On the one, on the drum, kick, snare
Blown now I'm on in the business
Pistols, home of the Pistons
Out to Virginia
Back to the D where I was born and raised
Back to the beats on the stage
Wack niggas, R.I.P., piss on your grave
No love, was born to hate
Know you can't believe
How we keep doing it
Produce like a beast
Boy, Rick Rubin shit
Watch how I maneuver shit
Spit Black spit that shit like manure gets
I be on the move
Slow down, slow down, let me catch the groove
Extra, extra, let me execute
X these niggas, show 'em the exit out
Make they baby mamas they ex's
If I ain't the best that means that I'm next bitch
Flows, affected
To the point where these niggas feel disrespected
Leave 'em on respirators, disconnected
Uh, disconnection
No contest, quit

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Royce Da 5'9"]
Come on
{gun shot}
Nigga where your cash at?
I don't battle rap rap, I shoot niggas eyes out
I just cataract cats, roger that
Nottz where the bottle at?
(Nigga I don't drink)
Okay then, I'ma honor that
Drink for you till I need you to think for me like an Almanac
Far as y'all Internet, in a nut, while you on the Internet
Bragging 'bout your intellect, I be fucking bad bitches
Dragging out they inner slut
In effect huh
Take a niggas past like an interception
{crowd cheering}
D-Boys in here chilling
We tote things that'll destroy buildings
We approach shit like, if you owe
We repo shit, we atrocious, we could throw fist
But we oppose this
When we mad [?] tag toe tip animals bitch

[Hook]
