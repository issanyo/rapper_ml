How can Hip Hop possibly expose me when I’m so real niggas can’t hold me?
Nickel’s so ill miss me with the Loud talk I’m trying to be a player, you Chris Rock talking to Kobe
But I don’t play sports, I play a little game called "Make your face look like the front of Kanye’s Porsche"
I’m getting better by the second you can feel it, can’t ya?
And I’m still a gangsta, y'all niggas can play brothers 'till I kill 'em you feeling the little Willis, ain't ya?
What kind of artist a killer, that wouldn’t kill a paintbrush?
Oh, really, you sold dope just for it turn you the color purple you niggas is so silly
Nigga please listen to me, you tripping if you think I’ll ever diss my nigga Ortiz
This is Shady 'till the death of this feeling like the best in this
Paul Rosenberg on the messages Bad Meets Evil now it’s definite
I’m the opposite of pessimist that’s my absolute optimistic testament
Quick question, who you know touch it, Slaughterhouse outlaws call us no justice
I just work hard I don’t even know what this is going on call it Bar Exam 4 fuck it
Soon as the deal done boy you know it’s a Slaughter
You don’t know us for starters we exploding thinking you can swim with piranhas
You remind me of Obama, you don’t know much about oil and water
Loaded Glock in the Bugatti gun rap big dick bitch looking like I Photoshopped it on my body
Nigga there’s gotta be, nobody hot as me
You ain’t seen a sicker male only way to see a sicker cell nigga you would have to go inside of Prodigy
Diss? No, the sick flow, the overhand right’s like Klitschko... NICKEL!
