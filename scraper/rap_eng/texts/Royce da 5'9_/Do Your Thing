[Intro] [Guilty Simpson speaking]
Yeah, this ain't no overnight shit right here homie
Been doin' this shit for years man. Been doin' my motherfuckin' thing
I ain't gonna stop neither. Gotta get it for real
Revolution know what time it is. Watch me do my thing

[Verse One] [Guilty Simpson]
Yo
I'm from the inner city
Where you gotta hustle to eat
And your peers wanna kill you if you fuck with police
Young boys bustin' the heat
Tuck you to sleep
I twist one, fuck with a freak and fuck with a beat
I came a long way
Gun play, shoot outs
Tore the whole block out, moved into a new house
Moms stressed out and my broad got an attitude
So I wrote a rap or two about what's on the avenue
I admit the style was shoot 'em up
But your crew got wild each time I cued it up
And the broads got loose when I spit the game
But I heard around town that clowns bit the name
So I added Simpson to make it authentic
A true hip hop sound, laced with raw lyrics
Decades ahead of my time
Battle with rhymes or battle with nines
I can straddle the line

"Doin' my thing"
"Hustle hard for cash"
"On the mic"
"In the streets"
"Right back to the beats"

C'mon and do your thing
I had to do my thing
Do your thing
I'mma still do my thing
Do your thing
Watch me do my thing
You had to do your thing
Yeah, watch me do my thing
I know
Do it, do it
Stop and think back, to the time you started

[Verse Two] [Royce Da 5'9"]
Rhymin' in the lunch room
Tappin' on the table top
Trapper Keeper full of rhymes, smackin' on a tatter tot
Growin' and knowin' I'm the best, mid-west
Left east coast, hot as fire from the Tec we tote
We spoke, weed smoke, we came and we flame
We sick, we spit, we shit, but we broke
We cope, we focused on seein' the D blow
We know, good things come to those that keep hope
Battle after battle with the futureless Future niggas
I do to them what two gorillas do to food for livin'
It's survivor when the mic alive
People listenin'
And when you battle with looney tune keep your distance
Get in my face, get wasted, take six
Like a director on the sixth take with a fake script
Get rid of beef like steak tips
Get curled like a weight lift
Or Jheri your curl like a K clip
But no, my guns never shootin' over he say, she say
I'm the product of kept-the-peace way
Whatever we spray, we kill
Never loose it
We'd rather start a Revolution like the DJ

I had to do my thing

Do your thing
Watch me do my thing
You had to do your thing
Yeah, watch me do my thing
I know
Do it, do it
Stop and think back, to the time you started
