[Intro: Royce da 5'9"]
Yeah…
I feel like a… new motherfucker, man
Alright, let’s get the dust off
Let’s get back to work
Stretch
Nickel

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Yeah – I said victory, defeat – parallel feelings
Getting rich, friends trip, farewell bid ‘em
You go against me you won’t fare well
I’ll leave your ass bleeding in the stairwell
Turn you to the “the” between the “where Hell”
Is he, like the cologne that I spray on him?
Emerald, my stones so clean they looking sterile
I’m so major, that when I pass, treat these last flows like the last scroll
Auction off these last known pages
Stuck in my own ways, making asshole wages
Username is Passcode Vegas
It’s Nickel, nigga, you can keep your little two cents
No longer the Patron enthusiast, on to a new blueprint
I feel like zoning, find the headphones and spew it for my own amusement
Until it’s tool time, I ain’t use it for home improvement
And I don’t have to know magic, bruh
I’m waving this ratchet like abracadabra
That’s a cadaverer, and only God to witness our resemblance
My guys relentless, riding like Mogwais inside the Gremlin
Designer rifles out the window, you ain’t seen this heat
Banana clips see-through, looking like ballerina feet
Got your entire age-range on my dick
It’s nothing to put your little stage name on my list
I took a little break to make some plans in my life
I never thought I’d see the day that I’d put hands on my wife, but
That’s another story, perhaps another chapter
In the book written autobiographic by a warrior
Another story of a good guy whose eyelids are drunken shut
Getting fucked up so much, you don’t know what the fuck is up
Watching World Star, clutching a cup
Right after giving a side chick a bus driver uppercut
But that’s another story
I’m just getting the dust off
Slaughterhouse
Goodbye…
