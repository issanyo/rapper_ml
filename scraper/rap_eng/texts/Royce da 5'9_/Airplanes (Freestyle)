[Verse]
Since '99 I've been dope in this, focusin, unfocusin'
Sure as the sun floats and sure as the sun smokin'
I was the gun totingest, my cuz told me
Don't get demoted, keep it close to your digits
You know you get it, you let yaself get too close to 'em chickens
I said, "I disagree," then I let Superhead lick on me
Strokin' the kitten of Kat Stacks, 'bout to turn around
And write a book about both of them bitches
Next stop, to the top, I done went from A to X,Y
Almost at Z, chillin' at a rest stop
My new bitch, call her my PS3, you?
Your bitch pussy, call it my Xbox
Me, I'm the rhyme ruler, me and Denaun together
Deadly as Nas in his prime, you 'bout deadly as a benign tumor
Since '92, been a highly touted retarded truth
Prolly 'bout to Eli Porter-potty somebody booth
Never sellin my soul, I'm sellin' my skills
I'm on Rap's Radar now, Elliott Wilson
Painter of the underground canvas, even though
I can't freelance no more, the underground's famished
Before I settle for less then average, I'll swallow a watermelon
Follow it with a Double-Down sandwich
I swear that God told me
Slaughterhouse would be the second time around for me
All eyes on me, I know I'm not the greatest, I go hard
Your boombox is now invaded, Bogart, ha!
Look at me today, 8 years ago
I was popular for being hated, Solar!
Nickel Nine's the ruler, God combined with Buddha
Gifted oblongata, prized medulla
Each line's like a computer bomb designed by MacGyver
That only can be detonated by a MacGruber
I'm thinking if I ain't binge-drinkin' then I ain't livin'
Somebody told me I'm prolly dyin', but I ain't listen
By the time it could harm me I'll prolly die by a trigger
So I'm only goin' cold turkey, right after Thanksgivin'
I paint pictures between blank scriptures
Now just how contradictory is it that I pray?
The name's Royce and I be poppin' so much pussy
Dwight Howard look at me sideways
And while the bitches try to grab all on my dick
I can't even get my own nigga to rap on my shit
You form a clique, it should be sacred, I shouldn't say shit
Cause the Truth Hurts, like the bitch that Dre ditched
Nobody loves my niggas like me
Sober or wasted, for you there's no replacement
I swear that God told me
Slaughterhouse would be the second time around for me
All eyes on me!
