[Intro: Lincoln &  Porsche]
Hello
Hey Lincoln
Hey Porsche what's up
Hey baby what's up
Nah nothing much, what's up with you?
Nah nothing, got this broke ass nigga outside
Oh y'all about to go out? Hang?
I ain't going out for long
Probably cause he don't be blowing no good
Naw baby he ain't like you, he don't be blowing no good
Haha well shit I got hotpockets in the oven, what you need?
I wanna see you later
Well my son do got a basketball game later on, but that lil nigga ain't even starting so
You so crazy
Yeah I'm...I can save that gas, I'll be through there

[Verse 1]
I been waiting in this bitch driveway for an hour my nigga, hell no
There's only one way I can fix this problem my nigga, that's sell dope
I ain't come in this bitch to politic or rub elbows
Even my own bitch know I'm mentally unavailable, I'm busy, I sell dope
I'm focused, I'm focused, I'm focused on three things
That's go and buy three chains, that's fuck your bitch at my earliest convenience and sell dope
When I'm with her she creeping on you, when I hit it I hit it with my phone on speaker phone
While she's moaning I'm still tryna, tryna sell dope
My teacher asked me what I wanna do when I grow up, I told her "Bitch, sell dope"
She told me go to the principal's office, I went to go sell dope
I don't care about y'all, what y'all wear, where y'all been
All I know is I'm fresh as fuck from head to toe
If you don't like it you can get the fuck out my car
Go over there somewhere and ride Pierre Cardin (You rude)
And when you see that bum make sure you tell him I said that I sell dope
For all the times I was dead broke
Speaking of dead, when I die, I swear I'mma try, I'mma still try to sell dope, sell dope

[Hook 1]
There's no other life out here I know
So I guess I should...
Sell dope
This is the only life for me
So I...
Sell dope
The nights are long and cold
Long and cold
But out here on these streets you'd swear I had pure gold
Pure gold
In my hands I hold your hope
Nigga cause I...
Sell dope

[Verse 2]
This bitch told me I can't get them digits my nigga, my nigga, aw hell no
It's only one way I'mma fix this my nigga, that's sell dope
A fan asked me for a picture, I squatted down for a jail pose
Then I dashed before the flash could finish, I forgot I had to go sell dope
What news you got, if it ain't about selling dope, I can't take it
The doctor gave me five months to live, I told her "Nigga, I can't make it"
Tell whoever set my expiring date I had a prior engagement to sell dope
That's why I'm in every discussion, I could sell a whale a bucket
Of well water, I could sell Harriot Tubman a mothafuckin' railroad
I'm the flower with the thorn rising out the concrete, y'all just born on Melrose
I stay strapped, I stay strapped like velcro
When I meet new people I introduce myself as "I sell dope"
I just had a job interview, they asked if I ever been to jail before
I said "Yes" then I got up and left, like fuck this shit I'mma sell dope
Cause right now I'm dead broke
Speaking of dead, when I die, I swear I'mma try, I'mma still try to sell dope, I'mma try to sell dope

[Hook 2]
There's no other life out here I know
So I should...
Sell dope
This is the only life I know
The nights are long and cold
Long and cold
But out here on these streets you'd swear I had pure gold
Pure gold
In my hands I hold your hope
Nigga cause I...
Sell dope

[Outro]
America, America, God shed His grace on thee
America, America, when will we all be free?
(I say it every day of my life God bless America)
