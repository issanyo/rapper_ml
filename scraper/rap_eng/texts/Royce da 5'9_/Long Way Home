[Hook: J.W. Miller]
I took the long way home
To the middle of nowhere
I couldn’t find Rome
Even though all roads are going there
I couldn’t find the edge
Even if I wanted to jump off it
(Yeaaaaaaaaaah!)

[Verse 1: Jay Daniels]
I see my destination, I know I got death awaitin'
But when i'm a step away from it, tell it to just be patient
All of a sudden me and Royce in similar places, crazy
The future ain’t bright for me, for him it’s now Shady
And I’m backwards, everyone sees I’m acting
Like I don’t feel the pain, but they see me with a reaction
Man, I don’t know who i'm talking to like a private call
Cause fake fans are all around me when my homies fall
Ask me how it feels to be unemployed and broke at 20
Tryna pursue a music career and spending every single penny
On clothes and accessories, when I got beats and session fee's
And my feet are just testing me as i'm walking a long way, please
Spare me some knowledge, spare me something man
Cause I’m tryna understand as a younger man
I’m scared of life, how do I deal with it?
I guess I take a mic, and just reveal with it

[Hook: J.W. Miller]
I took the long way home
To the middle of nowhere
I couldn’t find Rome
Even though all roads are going there
I couldn’t find the edge
Even if I wanted to jump off it
(Yeaaaaaaaaaah!)

[Guitar Break: J.W. Miller]

[Verse 2: Jay Daniels]
You would think that I’m living life backwards
Cause I’m dying to be alive
Half of ya'll been trying to escape the fame
When i'm waiting to arrive in it
And the fans will ride with it, the hatred I survive with it
I need the crowd to stand up before I dive in it!
Affected by the brain, directed by the heart
I work for mine cause I never been connected from the start
I seem to always over think the wrong situation
And people always think I’m making the wrong stipulation
Wake me up from paranoia, I been waiting like a foyer
Tryna fill a void in the game, and avoid every lawyer
Cause I ain’t clearing samples, all I’m clearing is the facts
There's nothing else that matters on a Charlie Hilton track

[Hook: J.W. Miller]
I took the long way home
To the middle of nowhere
I couldn’t find Rome
Even though all roads are going there
I couldn’t find the edge
Even if I wanted to jump off it
(Yeaaaaaaaaaah!)

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah
No matter how many of my homies say that I’m hot
The moment that I stop, they gone which means my ambiance is not
And this shit's obvious i'm, kind of like a lobbyist I
Find it ironic that I, come from poverty and
Eating emcee's is my hobby so why would you try me?
My, conduct is violent, now, line up in silence (Shhhhhh)
I’m taking the long way to death, I’m waitin'
As a matter of fact, wait, shit, death ain’t my destination
Be patient, the only home I know is on the go
A rolling stone, wipe your feet where I lay my hat
Which means, survival is my only means of livin'
Money is simply what’s taken away and what is given
If you take me away, then you’re forgiven
You just a killer, I'll go and meet up with Proof and Dilla
Me and my little homie JD
Until you kill us it's "Fuck you, pay me"

[Hook: J.W. Miller]
