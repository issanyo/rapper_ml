Verse 1:
I feel like I can lift the world and put the planet on my shoulders
But I seen those artists fall
And let the weight just hold them down, but
I can't stop now, I'm in it too deep
I put too much time and money for abilities to peak, see
I've seen my capabilities, overcome the probabilities
That society instilled in me, but still I see
Other artists fall, that were just as good as me cause
Even with that mind of making it, it gets harder to breathe
But when I catch that glimpse of fresh air
It is right there, that I see my dreams ascend, yeah
Then I put that mic in my hand, it's very clear
This is my time dude
Flow's a perfect ten so we gonna Nickle and dime you
My rhymes grew, my minds screwed, that rent's due
But I'll die trying rather than have these dreams not come true
This is a struggle, how much more can I try?
I don't wanna work this 9 to 5, I'd rather work with 5'9"

Hook:
Love or career, no limits, no fear cause
You can make it, you can make it
See success in the mirror, it's closer than it appears, know that
You can make it, you can make it
On that path you steer, straight and narrow, don't veer cause
You can make it, you can make it
In my voice you can hear, all my pain and my tears, know that
You can make it, you can make it. (yeah, Nickle. Yeah.)

Verse 2:
All my life, I lived a life of beats, rhymes and street shit
Had my ups and downs, hustling around but in these times, I
Throw up the peace sign, who I eat with, its feast time
Now rewind, I used to listen to Esham in a Nissan
Now I'm ridin' round' the D in Porsche's
And I don't need media sources, to enforce that we important
Just for the moment, don't let it get to your head, don't
Allow your mind to be weak and you gotta be headstrong
I made it here, embodying all of my latest fears
Drunk as at the party, still my cadence clear
My equilibrium on the same zone my swag on
Car riding good, she in a good mood, her ride gone
Just like my bitch
Just my mistress, she likes my bitch but can't have her
Before I snitch, I think I'd rather; drop dead
Before I drop a dime like Hank Gathers, that's devastation
I take my life myself, to help my self-preservation

Hook:
Love or career, no limits, no fear cause
You can make it, you can make it
See success in the mirror, it's closer than it appears, know that
You can make it, you can make it
On that path you steer, straight and narrow, don't veer cause
You can make it, you can make it
In my voice you can hear, all my pain and my tears, know that
You can make it, you can make it
