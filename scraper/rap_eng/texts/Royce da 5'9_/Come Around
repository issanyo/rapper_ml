[Hook:]
I used to, singing, baby
Oh, around why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
(You-You good if you know me)
Around
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Sing about a melody, aww
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
(You good if you know me)
Around
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Anything you want to sing about
Just sing it on out, now, sing it on out
Let the world know what life's all about


[Verse 1 - Termanology]
Come on, (Statik Selektah), 'ology baby
What, uh

Jeffrey Dahmer, Ready Freddy, Nirvana
All day, now kicks white like baby powder
You a coward, give you a lead shower
It's ours, me and Stat' the Twin Towers
I Gave You Power, this is that Nas shit
My weed sour and I pushed powder
Now I write, DX, Double X
More checks, swallow X, cold Becks
Slow steps, cop shit like Pro Keds
Dame Dash of rap, I push cold vets
So let's get it in for my twins
All my friends in the Benz with their friends runnin triz
Jacuzzi, movie, the bonita'll move me
My lucy lovin and loogie'll prove to me she a groupie bitch
Stupid chips in the whip, makin movie clips
Robbin banks with +five nines+, killin the music bus'

[Hook:]

[Verse 2 - Royce Da 5'9"]
Woo! Alright, I'm here, hahaha

Nickel is, Statik is, Term' is, how could you possibly top me?
Them poppers is choppy, lookin like my whole block is a rocky
Me and hip-hop go together like swastika and Nazi
Together like 2Pac and "who shot me?"
Together like the new President Barack and the hot seat (haha)
I'm ever so evidently colder than y'all
Even after y'all niggas go to the morgue
I got a flow like there's no tomorrow
That you couldn't hold or borrow or bite it
Easy said, harder to write it
I got the brain of a miser, heart of a lion
Got the spit game of a geyser, the art of Orion
Y'all niggas losin weight daily like the real Carson
Excuse the psychology like Dr. Phil fartin (haha)
Lyrical sword that I'm still sharpenin
AK-47, I'm still sparkin
