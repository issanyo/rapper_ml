[Intro: Royce da 5'9"]
This is a little something to ride to
Kick back and just catch a vibe to
I'd pop me a pill, I'd drink me another drink, if I was you

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
I got the flyest arsenal
Clip filled to capacity, you can call me the fire marshal
I'm ape and shit, I'm on my gorilla thing-thing
Me and Preem, you can call us the guillotine team
We chop off heads, pop off lead
If it pops off, we spending that rockstar bread
We doing numbers like the box office
Nigga you ain't tryna box, then stop talking
I got niggas from Watts to Boston
From New York to the Chi to Austin
So even if my eyes is off ya, other eyes is on ya
That belongs to them killers that's gon' ride up on ya, boom!
It's gasoline in my tongue
Patron in my kidneys, weed in my lungs
Trigger on my index finger, handle in my palm
Ears ringing, my animal alarm
My mind is on Hannibal Lec, demand the respect
I'm taking your life 'less you hand me a check

[Hook: Phonte]
I've been around, seen some things, sexed a lot of girls
I did my time but in my mind, I'm still thinking it's my world

[Bridge: Royce da 5'9"]
I got my finger on the pulse of this music shit
I'm the truest, shit
Now tell me who this sick
And you can swallow everythin that's comin through this dick

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Reigning king of the boom-bap
Bomb strapped to my chest askin "Where ya goons at?"
I'm old school like a StarTac
On a voyage like Star Trek, me unemployed is far fetched
I'm hot, I got the corduroy flow
You can picture but can't shake it, the Polaroid show
I book niggas for shows and put niggas in comas
So I hope that you niggas is roamers
Cause my niggas is riders like Winona
But we just tryna have a good time like Willona
I'm a zoner, all I do is zone out, like a stoner
As far away as Estonia
I'm a sucker for a good sucking, so tell ya bitch
That's it's best if she invest in what it's good luck in
Mami, would you rather fly over niggas heads?
Or keep your ass in the hood ducking?

[Hook: Phonte]
I've been around, seen some things, sexed a lot of girls
I did my time but in my mind, I'm still thinking it's my world

[Bridge: Royce da 5'9"]
I got my finger on the pulse of this music shit
I'm the truest, shit
Now tell me who this sick
And you can swallow everythin that's comin through this dick

[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9"]
Pardon my French, talk English
Steal your job, the discount is the five fingers
That's why Preem is the head-nod king
My drive's on my toes, I got my Bedrock swing
Street Hop is the culture, I rock with the vultures
To make bread with the opposite toaster
I'm Py-reckless, I'm kitchen, the quips sickening
And my neckless is glistening, it's expensive
So don't mention your ice whenever you mention my rhymes
(Why?) Cause my pencil is priceless
So what you running for? Nigga I'm coming for you
If I'm the hyphen, then you the underscore
True, and I'm lawless packing
I ain't no designer but I got a flawless jacket, whoa!
After "Boom," this afternoon
It's night-night when me and Preem come back for more

[Hook: Phonte]
I've been around, seen some things, sexed a lot of girls
I did my time but in my mind, I'm still thinking it's my world

[Bridge: Royce da 5'9"]
I got my finger on the pulse of this music shit
I'm the truest, shit
Now tell me who this sick
And you can swallow everythin that's comin through this dick

[Outro]
This is a little something to ride to
Kick back and just catch a vibe to
I'd pop me a pill, I'd drink me another drink, if I was you
