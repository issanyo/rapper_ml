[Intro]
Yeah, what's up girl? This my love song
Maybe you should or maybe you just shouldn't
Cause baby I wanna take you so far away, ay
I'm just playin, I don't really wanna take your ass nowhere
Let's do the real song, come on

[Hook]
Maybe you should or maybe you just shouldn't
Cause baby this gun'll take you so far away, ay
(He'll walk right up and murder you)
Maybe you should or maybe you shouldn't
Cause me and my goons'll take you so far away, ay

[Verse 1]
It's definitely a burner
It's on cause that beef be the recipe to murder
Whoever's in my session's an accessory to murder
My words put niggas to bed, my records be the Serta
Ay, the raw grind is comin up like wall climbers
Big shit poppin, them pricks is small timers
And y'all musta forgot like Juelz Santana perform
At Hip Hop Honors with the Alzheimer's
I hear you woofin, come on, come to the dog diner
We all eat dogs, we raw, we bark buyers
You can't walk by us and talk fly or we'll hogtie ya
Nickel done fucked around and caught fire
I carry the torch and split a nigga up-up
Somebody gon' die, die like a scary divorce
Of course my goons is astoundin
Nigga I use the Auto-Tune because I'm clownin

[Hook]
Maybe you should or maybe you just shouldn't
Cause baby this gun'll take you so far away, ay
(He'll walk right up and murder you)
Maybe you should or maybe you shouldn't
Cause me and my goons'll take you so far away, ay

[Verse 2]
Nigga you don't want a problem
I'm photogenic, my image belong on a dollar, authentic
My tennis shoes should have "I'm killin you" written on the side of
The willingness to go in, like whatever's inside of a diver
Get in his ass like a sodomizer
Fix him by any means like the plot of MacGyver
Nickel runnin for shit, you need to vote for him
They unloadin his flow off of the boat for him
Pardon me Miss Sniffle Nose, the coke charm
I spit shit crazy, with the toast arms
My kicks is crazy, like Zohan
I'm the nucleus of this like a proton
Gat supplier, red nose
Carving your staff or shire, rap for hire
Niggas is corny by nature, on top of that
Niggas arms is shorter than my nigga Vinny from Naughty by Nature

[Hook]
Maybe you should or maybe you just shouldn't
Cause baby this gun'll take you so far away, ay
(He'll walk right up and murder you)
Maybe you should or maybe you shouldn't
Cause me and my goons'll take you so far away, ay
