[Intro]:
Yeah, I got one problem, that's alcohol, a nigga or a bitch ain't one

[Verse]:
Yeah I'm done talkin, I converse with guns sparkin'
Chop ya whole crew up and put y'all in one coffin
Pull up in somethin awesome
Valet should pay to park it
A motherless God made me when he created arson
Keep bustin' until they all gone
I'm triple w dot murder, log on
A lot of mouth on these rap niggas a lot of doubt me
A bunch of lame ass niggas, soundin like Roger Troutman
You need to look at my track record I'm spazz happy
I heard a well known fag just took a jab at me
Yeah you already know what I do to fools
So when I see you I ain't gon' be in the Muzik Mood
Get you stomped good
Take ya ho and turn her to a overnight celebrity like that nigga that punched Suge
Don't gotta thank the player
You welcome to Detroit
The city that you can't compare with the gangsta mayor
You wet you ain't the sprayer
Fuck what ya TV say
Them ain't no real D niggas snitchin on DEA
The topic of your discussion is my release date
Bottle after bottle I drink till I can't see straight
Niggas quit askin me questions about Ca$his
As long as he's still signed with my nigga Shady, he's straight
I ain't got no problem wit him, but I will promise this
Next nigga throwing my name around I'mma kill him
I got a lot to spend, spent so much time putting cheese on my enemies
I forgot to watch my friends
Thought I was already covered until I found out
My nigga Tre Little was loyal as R. Kelly's brother
They say you talk about rappers whatever you do
I like to talk about pussy like Devin The Dude
Getting this shit is fun
Me you don't expect to run
Ain't gotta respect me, just don't disrespect my gun
I came in and dude fled from the boxing match
He ran like a huge head in a stocking cap
You little niggas keep cool
Cause I eat dudes
When I see you shrimp niggas all I do is seafood/see food
Lord, fuck a boss I'mma God
Parked outside a muthafucka's house ain't a homicide
Them niggas you got in your car say they down to ride
His tongue cool, but evidently his Llama tired
BOP
Y'all can doubt me
This long legged clip walking out be the only thing POP about me
Who could stop me?
I hit him like I'm Luca Brasi
So many bitches on my dick nigga Luke would jock me
Who the sickest shit to spit?
Is it me or is it triggers?
Cause you ain't comparing me to any nigga
Any Wayne, any Jigga we can bang
Any figure we can bet
I will slang any nigga you can check
Who the best?
Now until any volunteer DJ wanna give me play
Meantime you can sweat
I come to your set
Nigga I don't give a fuck
You Raisin Bran ass niggas sound shriveled up
The price you gotta pay, doin what them dollars say
Happy Bar Exam 2 bitch, it's a holiday
The price you gotta pay, doin what them dollars say
Happy Bar Exam 2 bitch, it's a holiday
