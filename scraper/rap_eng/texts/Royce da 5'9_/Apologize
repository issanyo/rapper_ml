(Hook)
Anything I've ever done in the past to hurt you
I apologize to you
I apologize
Anything I've ever done in the past to hurt you
I apologize to you
I apologize
{Repeat}

(Verse 1)

She cooks and Cleans
Irons my clothes like a Queen is supposed to
She hates when I drink
My miserable company don't know her
Won't bring us closer
This is an incredible woman I'm speaking on, now
Its not about looks or comparing her to Beyonce Knowles
Her roles more of a Rosa Parks
She knows her part, she's so smart
By the way she's fucking gorgeous she glows in the dark
I doubt if she lies
I will bet the farm she's been 100% faithful I cry when she cries
It's Ill, something that took a year to get
Extended to 6 years to the date
And end from a 10 minute mistake
That's not the way, she's got a good advantage
That's 50% of me gone, that's not a good balance
Second to my mother, a commodity
She's special, damn near close to her quality
Follow me
