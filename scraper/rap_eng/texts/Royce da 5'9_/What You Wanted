[Verse 1: Max Wonders]
I know I won't be young forever
I know I won't find Cinderella
Sitting in a party, fall in love, and then we get together
With her heels in her hand and her heart in the other
Break that right in half then I write her letters
About what could've been the coldest winter, get a sweater
Don't tell me that 'cause you know I know you don't know no better
I smell the red, don't be cheese-chasing
I know I've been speedracing until I hit a fly

[Hook: Max Wonders]
Ain't this what you wanted all along?
Don't you hold yourself back, hold yourself back, no
Ain't this what you wanted all along?
Don't you hold yourself back, hold yourself back, no

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
I've been a fighter like my whole life
Niagara Falls and Jesus Christ is what I write my flow like
Born leader, see me going left, I might just go right
I come here to affect the masses, nigga, mic or no mic
Whatever passion I would've picked
Would've spazzed and been good at it
Homie used to show up to school for classes just full of chicks
I'm flashy, I'm stuck in my ways
If you ever actually catch me not balling I'm probably adjusting my J's
Rockstar gripping this hot car with his thot stalling
The dudes I used to be cutting up with was not boring
Surrounded by thugs and corruption at the top parties
Bottles and drugs, models and toilets surround the world
Respected as an artist at the top regardless
Cause every spitter know every shit I put out be flawless
I'm tryna keep getting flyer and buy my house in orbit
Surprise my mother with another and another before this song could come out
Quick shit, I'm 'bout to spoil it

[Hook: Max Wonders]
Ain't this what you wanted all along?
Don't you hold yourself back, hold yourself back, no
Ain't this what you wanted all along?
Don't you hold yourself back, hold yourself back, no

[Verse 3: Max Wonders]
Hollywood done got my face frozen
With shades on like I hate moments
My great-great told me not to duck and fade 'cause if I'm good at what I do then I can't avoid it
Like TMZ polaroid-ing when I pull up at the hotel
I'm R. Kellz and Cassidy with it
And I'm just wrapping up the package, I'm passing the image
And if it's blasphemy they speak then we casting the villains
Outside the village, we cross bearing, new wave sinners
So pray for me I pray for you, and hope He bless us all
But I thought this is what you wanted, don't you stress it, dawg
You still young, got time, let me cut you off
Before you [?] sinners piss me off, I can't take a loss
'Cause Royce was working 9-5 'till he turn to 5'9"
Got that Rolls, now we Rolls Royce pulling off
I guess I'm tryna say that I don't have no time to wait, no time to waste
So you can't tell me when I am taking off

[Hook: Max Wonders]
Ain't this what you wanted all along?
Don't you hold yourself back, hold yourself back, no
Ain't this what you wanted all along?
Don't you hold yourself back, hold yourself back, no
(Ain't this what you wanted all along?
Don't you hold yourself back, hold yourself back, no)

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Ride with me, oh baby, won't you ride
Baby, won't you ride with me, oh baby, won't you ride
Baby, won't you slide with me, oh baby, won't you slide
Got that 911 parked out front, don't front, girl, come outside
Ride with me, oh baby, won't you ride
Oh baby, won't you ride with me, oh baby, won't you ride
Oh baby, won't you slide with me, oh baby, won't you slide
Got that 911 parked out front, don't front, girl, come outside
