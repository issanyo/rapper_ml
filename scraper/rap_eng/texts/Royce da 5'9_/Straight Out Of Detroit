[Verse 1: Kid Vishis]
Straight out of Detroit, a crazy motherfucker named Vishis
Aiming for the richest though I come from the trenches
Son of a killer, get lead poison from the thriller
Bullets missed you, it’s cool
Cause it’ll still hit you nigga
I’m back, a black lone ranger, divine force
On my high horse, riding round looking for danger
Detroit mangler, I see Royce famous so I’m hungry
But keep the fame, I just want the money
Like 3 men in one, get your gun right now
If I verse the power to put your lights out
When I strike-out, lash-out, your ass out
How you going to war with royalty? What your cash bout?
I came here to stomp you, till you bleed
I walked in wearing Jordans, red bottoms when I leave
Catch you in the club, and see it dumping
While your fist pumping
You cash your jewels bitch, run it
You hard when you rhyme boy
But your crew remind me of bitches in men’s clothes
Y’all a bunch of tom boys
Put your swag in a bag zip it up
Prolly trash, if you can spit
It still ain’t sick as us
Nigga trust I’m head hunting your pumpkin
But lead dumping and spread down to your legs
From aims nothing
Big bank take little bank
You'll lose Morris Day stash
Couple extra grand in the shoes

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
You about to witness the natural maturation of Ryan
Taking it back to fat laces and iron
I am on an actual fact basis, spacing out on the track
Weight supplying
Be came a long way from niggas wanting me blown away
To after I’m gone wanting my bones donated to science
Predicting my own unpredictable fate
The same as the Mayans
I’m when you define great
Then continue to translate it to crime, uh
The ill pedigree, tell your ho chill
She gotta kneel before the "d" and then I let her see
And before I let her be
I drop her in the A, let her spree
She shopping till she fell asleep
As soon as the emblem on the Benz
Hit the hood tell her peace
Like Meta World, never let a girl
Like ?, better you instead of me
Now tell the feds the can alphabetically swallow a set of these
And that’s right, Vishis your boy protégé
Riding in the infamous Bentley and Porsche motorcade
Every chick you know is a ho, my boat stow away
Every goon I roll with's a throw away four-four away
Y’all trying to  teach, I’m tryna just win fuck pointers
I got enough ends to cut corners
Just join us, as I ride for status, my status on grind
Niggas who mind don’t matter
Who matter don’t mind
