[Royce da 5'9"]
Yeah, yeah, yeah; I'm a beast (1)
I'ma be leavin y'all sleep all in them trauma sheets (2)
The pall bearer the one, the two carrying you (3)
To who burying you on the count of three (4)
I'm the llama to squeeze (5)
I can promise my knowledge degrees has started a lot of beefing (6)
The gall of you to call to who all of you to pause (7)
The fall of your momma's cheeks (8)
Yeah, then drama cease, I'ma try to teach (9)
You could be deep and, wind up kinda deep, yeah (10)
No amount of sleep can, mold you into what you tryna be (11)
Can only make a soldier outta me (12)
I'm the eightball - sitting out of the way (13)
Of you finishing the product is able to face all (14)
I'ma just stay raw - instead of doin' songs for women (15)
I'll let y'all do 'em and all come and take y'alls (16)
This is before the rhyme, it's the truth (17)
After I put the "out of order" sign on the booth (18)
You can't stop me, I'm sticking Koch - you wishing (19)
Sony would just drop me like 50, yeah (20)
You sloppy, I will reign (21)
I will change and, transform into 'Pac like Lil Zane (22)
This is lyrical nation this is Rap City (23)
While you fiends get out-rapped by Tigga in Da Basement (24)
This tool I use on all of your peeps (25)
I call it my heat, cause I use it when I lose my cool (26)
It's too risky (27)
Took a line when who's sitting on the side of the new whip with a huge pistol (28)
The huge clip hanging outta the bottle (29)
The size of a bottomless pit (30)
Every goon, you gotta be hit, reduce the size of your clique (31)
Like POOF, like I am a magician (32)
I am a giant to you, trick (33)
I'm sicker than you, I feel like a pool stick in a room full of toothpicks (34)
Don't compare none of these rap wannabe (35)
Cats to me, the best fear me, the rest is scared money (36)
Now that I'm back on the scene (37)
It's back to your baby mamas chasing me, I'm back on TV (38)
Yeah buddy - come get me cause we ain't scared (39)
Catch a buck-fifty the size of Freeway's beard, yeah (40 nigga)
Ain't nobody vest preventing the 'K (41)
From ripping through bricks and hitting the rest of your henchmen (42)
Never been in the penitentiary, never get tense (43)
When there's war, never worry about catching a sentence (44)
I don't care if you strong especially since (45)
My weapon is long enough to bury you with whatever you benching (46)
I ain't friendly - I don't talk (47)
For nobody who ain't cutting a check unless you a dentist (48)
You can never attempt to, diss me (49)
If you do, I will censor the lead of that pencil (50)
You punks better be distant (51)
One punch'll leave you lumped and, dumber than Jessica Simpson (52)

Whooo, hahaha, yeah (yeah)
It's not often you hear an MC like this nigga (the M.I.C.!)
Take a picture of it, write it down
Do whatever you want I don't give a FUCK!
Yeah (haha) this what happens when
