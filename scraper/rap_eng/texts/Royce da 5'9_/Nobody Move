[Chorus: ???]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Everybody at war, nobody did dirt
Everybody before, nobody on shirt
I said nobody move, nobody get burned

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
After brushing my waves, quick to give you a fade
The hospitable, get down rap niggas that's lyrical
Content compliment the glow, blow, bomb another continent
I'll be down to go, say no mo'
Hoes watch me, foes clock me, but bros copy
That's fo' sho' throw jalopies up in broccoli
We smoke all Indians here, sway shit, sway roof
Caramel don coupe, call Snoop, call Luke
You need more bitches to smash
Bottle popping villains at last
Get your wine up, shine up
Come with a lineup to sign up
The guns on us designed up
What do you fear? Make it clear, yo
Alpaca rugs, drop your ashes
Boo, fix your lashes
My sister pulled up in the Aston to see something smashing Wanna smack something Rolex, she blasting
3 million dollars on the table with some African bitch
Yo, corporate kingpin that decorate
Now check the label like the Juice Crew
Fruit Punch gear on with ki on
Niggas, three on me
Two for you, one for me, I'm straight
I got the bitch with the Wraith
Dice game strippers, the wallabee king dippers
Buckle up the rap game like Parasuco zippers
The whip is, the long fo'-fifth is
The smoke spliff is, see the difference?
Can kill you whenever lay in Memphis

[Chorus: ???]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Everybody at war, nobody did dirt
Everybody before, nobody on the shirt
I said nobody move, nobody get burned
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Everybody at war, nobody did dirt
Everybody before, nobody shirt
I said nobody move, nobody get burned

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
I had lunchroom rap wars
Beef at school that I had to come to strapped for
I had a young crew, I had a one-two punch
I had to learn young that you could never undo guns
So I scrapped more
If you was acting bad you had to scrap with me, you lost
You was actually trash if you the cat that used to have a back
I hope you get it back Dukes of Hazzard fast
In this office penning all my most illest thoughts just sitting in the darkness
Everybody 'round me now is independent bosses
Get the wrong sentiment across from sent a milli karches
To kill a man, pretty woman coffins, kill his kilograms
Spilling coffee on his children's carpet talking with his friends
All convictions in, all committed sins is part of our religion
Are considered all-forgiving fam, we are repented
When the heat is on we don't fall under ceiling fans, no
We would rather fall where the ceiling stands
We would rather be where the buildings tall and it's children playing
With people who would rather feed to the dogs a quarter key of raw
Call that brick Capri or a or a kilogram

[Chorus: ???]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Everybody at war, nobody did dirt
Everybody before, nobody on shirt
I said nobody move, nobody get burned
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Everybody at war, nobody did dirt
Everybody before, nobody [?]
I said nobody move, nobody get burned

[Outro: ???]
I said, nobody move, nobody get hurt
