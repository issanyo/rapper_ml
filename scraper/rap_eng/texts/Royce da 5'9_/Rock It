[Intro: DJ Premier scratches]
You know I come around and rock it
I said Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
PRhyme, word up
You know I come around and rock it
They saying Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
You know I come around and rock it
Word up

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
I write for Sean Price and Dilla, my mic is Thriller
My ratchet blows, it's trappin' souls like Bryson Tiller
They sprayed the crib, left lead in the awnings
And that's the very thing that gets me out the bed in the mornin'
I got the bread in the corner, got my career in the sauna
I got no fear of dishonor, I bled and lived through trauma
First, the Fat Boys break up, then Bow Wow retires
And now y'all disrespectin' the King
I come through there with the street sweeper for niggas
Claimin' they doin' dirt and get to just disinfectin' the scene
I'm what you call the epitomizer of gettin' dark
I will spit a geyser
That'll give these guys on the charts the vitiligo of bars
I'm feelin' like the Don on the permanent throne
Weed like the Qu'ran, burn it, you can get stoned
It's smellin' like a megaphone in the coupe
Go into the extra zone in the booth, flow in the tool
The headphones, the microphone, and the new poems approve
I'm the best to ever put breaths on the measure
Metronome in the loop
All I can do is turn your sister to my all-night masseuse
Zonin' to Gu', this is my moment of truth

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
Can I rock it? Yes, you can
Now, can I rock it? Yes, you can
If she pretty, I'ma come around your city, I'm gon' hunt it down
Hit it, I'ma hit it, I'm gon' come around and rock it
Can I rock it? Yes, you can
Now, can I rock it? Yes, you can
Anytime I come around your city, I'm gon' burn it down
Venue after venue, I'm gon' come around and rock it

[Interlude: DJ Premier scratches]
You know I come around and rock it
You know I come around and rock it
You know I come around and rock it
Word up
You know I come around and rock it
You know I come around and rock it
You know I come around and rock it
Word up

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Now, first the Dipset split up, then Azealia Banks leave Twitter
And now you niggas hatin' on Nickel
I just been the same standup nigga
Since the day I came in this game
And I just come in here to stay til' I'm crippled
I'm a combination of Kane, G-Rap, Reggie Noble, and James
Who still has Ashanti and Kelly Rowland in dreams
They tried to blackball me, but couldn't, I was too fuckin' good
They tried to run me out of my city, I was too fuckin' hood
So, all I'm tryin' to say (say) to artists tryin' to kill me is
"Hey! Even Patron had to stand in line and wait"
This is God's work handcrafted by karma
I'ma always be here laughin' and clownin', last til' I promise
And last but not least, I'ma finally retire my dad
From out that post office, and that's on my mama
I live my life for my girls and my boys
And I took my soul back from the devil
Now the world can enjoy it

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
Can I rock it? Yes, you can
Now, can I rock it? Yes, you can
If she pretty, I'ma come around your city, I'm gon' hunt it down
Hit it, I'ma hit it, I'm gon' come around and rock it
Can I rock it? Yes, you can
Now, can I rock it? Yes, you can
Anytime I come around your city, I'm gon' burn it down
Venue after venue, I'm gon' come around and rock it

[Outro: DJ Premier scratches]
You know I come around and rock it
You know I come around and rock it
You know I come around and rock it

You know I come around and rock it
You know I come around and rock it
You know I come around and rock it
