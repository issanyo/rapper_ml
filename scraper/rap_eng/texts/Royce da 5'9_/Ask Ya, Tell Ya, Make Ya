[Chorus: Polzin]
Ask ya, tell ya, make ya (x3)
Don’t play with me boy, I’ll break ya
Ask ya, tell ya, make ya (x3)
Don’t play with me boy, I’ll break ya

[Verse 1: Trofee]
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley, I don’t even have a car
So Imma ask you really nice, give me the keys and I won’t break your arm
I’ll make ya, say you got a girl well Imma take her
Get nasty in the back seat, think I’m playing Imma break her
No faking, I’m all truth when I’m spitting it in the booth
Ripping your bitch ego into two, like deuces, spliff hanging out the coupe
Want proof bitch? I’ll send you straight to D12, rest in peace homey
I just gotta rep myself when these motherfuckers call me phony
Blow me, yeah all these cock suckers mind as well be dead
‘Cause all their cock sucking, blockbuster girlfriends in my bed
I’m not stopping, no octagons facing me with red
And yes I asked you, told you, made you listen to the words I said

[Verse 2: Chris Millz]
Ask ya, tell ya, make ya (x3)
Don’t play with me boy, I’ll break ya
Ask ya, tell ya, make ya (x3)
Don’t play with me boy, I’ll break ya
Ask ya tell ya make ya, once before I shake ya
Once before I break ya, I run it like the mayor
Ask ya, tell ya, make ya, That's how I make a hater
Respect me spot, my flow's sharper then a razor
Ask 'em, tell 'em, make 'em, You tell 'em bunch of fake stuff
Seeing through you windows like a curtain when it's raised up
Play tough, say what, they raise, bangers
Hammers hit you like a nail, you lucky if you wake up

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Young Slapz]
Its Young Slapz (uh) yeah, the boy flyer than a lear jet
Skigh high the clique but we ain't really there yet
Naw, man we ain't made it the top
But wen we do we ain't gone get like some balls and get dropped

Get flopped get paused (get paused) or get stopped
God fueled me with this crack im trying to open up shop
Niggas asking if i got bars, bitch plenty
Im in the stu ripping while im sipping on some simply

Lemonade, oh mane, im trying to get paid
Come on the track sicker than some lung cancer mixed wit aids
Ask me tell me make me what
Hip-hop playing hard to get and im trying get cuffed fool

[Verse 4: Don Juan]
Not only am I the best nigga in the whole motherfucking world
I'm the best when it comes to sticking ya chicken's kitten pearl
I got world rocker I call it the big dicker
I call you the cock blocker; She calls you to get liquor
Hooving all ya reggies and you'll be lucky to just lick her
I be blowing kush in that bitch face and then I go get face
And leave her face covered in white shit "Scarface"
She sucking the whole entourage "Vinny Chase"

Ask her tell her make her I blow an O of jamaica
You got an O in ya bank and you owe a teller to make up
I tell that tell her ma' if you do ya make up, I might take you up on ya offer
Until then I'm ass fucking your daughter


[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Royce Da 5’9]
Now lets talk about my pistol clip
If the gun is playing music then the pistol clip’s the instrument
The soldier holdin’ on to the fo-fo’s composing
The drummer’s brrrr, 7 6 2’s exploding
I am not indirect, I am so motherfuckin’ blunt
Pistol clip, pistol dick, bitch
I'm saying, you like
"Oh my God, get that gun out of my face"
It's not in your face, it's in my hand
