[Verse 1: Julius]
This is how it's gon go, nigga, I don't know no nigga
If you ain't my family, I'm not kicking it with you, this ain't a dojo, nigga
I be posted like a pose for a photo, nigga, hold on, nigga
Don't approach us, you know I got guns, you only die once, YODO, nigga
Let me tell you what's poppin' on my block
Niggas ain't coppin' no Maybachs
Niggas trynna bring the '80s back, niggas rocking them high-tops
Niggas [?] watch for the white cops
Watch for Crockett and Tubbs
If you ain't got nobody on your side looking out for you, you feel like the eye of a Cyclops
COB, we got it locked in Cali, our nickname is Pelican Bay
We've been together forever and a day
But you, view our crew as new
Like when the New Orleans Pelicans play
Maybe it's better that way
My homies, know what home is, my dawgs never gon' stray

[Hook: Julius]
Family Over Everything, nigga
This is the cold, try to be cool when it's hot
Take cover, shit, it's cold, I don't trust no nigga
Not a soul, but my pistol know if you Friend Or Foe
I don't trust y'all niggas, so fuck y'all niggas
See this lead, see them white sheets, gun's drawin' picture
The Grim Reaper lurking death as a cameo in every scene
So it's Family Over Everything, I don't trust y'all niggas

[Verse 2: Demetrius]
This is how it's gon' go Cuz
I give a fuck if you Blood or Cuz, or a blood cousin
I show no love, to a snake nigga, you a fake homo thug
We can chunk 'em, we can go to the cut and throw those up
So what, my grandparents died, they prolly in hell, shit, oh well, I still hold a grudge
Fuck all my aunties and uncles, I hope you get shot
If someone would slump you, I come from the block
With nothing as comfortable as running from cops
But no one would come through, not even my pops
I promise to God, pops you can die
But still I'm like "Fuck you", I'mma let God
Go ahead and judge you, just because you my father don't mean I'll hug you, or trust you, or love you
That's real shit sadly, being blood-related don't make you family
I love that nigga Jay Cee G dot and my nigga, Iceman, more than I love my granny
My older brothers were both my daddy
My own mother taught me how to be manly
I'm sad inside but when I grab this 9, I'm Trigga Happy

[Hook: Julius]
Family Over Everything, nigga
This is the cold, try to be cool when it's hot
Take cover, shit, it's cold, I don't trust no nigga
Not a soul, but my pistol know if you Friend Or Foe
I don't trust y'all niggas, so fuck y'all niggas
See this lead, see them white sheets, gun's drawin' picture
The Grim Reaper lurking death as a cameo in every scene
So it's Family Over Everything, I don't trust y'all niggas

[Verse 3: Kenny]
It's gon' go this way, nigga, we gon' get paid, nigga
If you not my family, I ain't trynna hang, man, this ain't a kid game, nigga
Other than Tech N9ne, the Shoes don't fuck with strange niggas
Forget lame niggas, I'm a grown man, forget gang members
Or they click bang, click click bang, nigga
Every player on your team needs to pick a role and execute teamwork like a pick and roll
If you don't know your members' dreams, you should get to know
You can't win on the same team shooting for different goals
Some got the intention to mislead you,  some got the intention to do evil
Fuck it, I rather not mingle with you people
I keep a tight circle like women who do Kegels
No trick SOBs in this set homie, and it's FOE with this

[Hook: Julius]
Family Over Everything, nigga
This is the cold, try to be cool when it's hot
Take cover, shit, it's cold, I don't trust no nigga
Not a soul, but my pistol know if you Friend Or Foe
I don't trust y'all niggas, so fuck y'all niggas
See this lead, see them white sheets, gun's drawin' picture
The Grim Reaper lurking death as a cameo in every scene
So it's Family Over Everything, I don't trust y'all niggas

[Verse 4: Dice]
I grip my chopper, me and the clique top shottas
I don't really care about how you feel, told y'all I be Chillin' With My Noccas
I be creepin', I be peepin' the hip hop cops and the snitch trynna watch us
If you look unfamiliar my gun will kill you in 3 seconds, tick tock pop ya
Fuck a 4, hustlas know niggas gotta stick to the fucking code
Yo these streets is fucking cold, I trust the Shoes, but I don't trust a soul, no
We back again, our backs against the wall
You ain't strong enough to back us down, this Shaq against Gasol
I'mma rapper with the gall, this ain't what I wanna say straight up
Wanna run up on the Shoes? Better lace up
Y'all bitches, fix ya lace front
Fake punks wanna get up in our mix, but In None We Trust
Don't fuck around and fuck with us
If yo team ain't fuckin' down, they fuckin' up
The fuck is up?

[Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9"]
How you think it's gon' go, guy?
They say real recognize real, I don't recognize yo vibe
I think we both know why
Just let hope float by when you see me like a old folk, nigga
It ain't my fault you broke, nigga
But if you talk shit about me, it might cost you, I might cut you off, or I might cut you, you might talk through yo throat, nigga
I'm the next OG, the last one left when the crew gone
My nigga, that's ok just as long as they carvin' FOE on my tombstone
That's an acronym, though I'm a foe to y'all, I live by certain protocol
If it don't kill me, it don't hurt me, I'll serve anybody cold turkey with no withdrawal
I used to wanna go pro, nigga
Now I got the option to even go solo or let Crooked I, or Joell or Joe go at the video shoot with a GoPro, nigga
Then I got sober, like "Fuck fortune and fame"
Family Over Everything, Slaughterhouse, Horseshoe Gang
