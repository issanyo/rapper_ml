Lord have mercy, my goal is only ever been to become a better lyricist
Not to become a veteran, not to become a legend
Just to get better with, time
I used to cut niggas, now all I sever is, ties
I'm not a mogul, I'm more like Moses my flow is apart
From anybody you see, your flow is a farce
The Lord is holding the chalice of blood over my empty vessel
That's under my chest so the whole world can notice a poet at heart
And I reach over to this side, pop a collar for Proof
And I squat down and shoot a shot in the air for Big L
And anybody else who was shot down on a stoop
You lame if all you know is swagger and your flow is average
I'm cut from the same cloth as the cloak that go with daggers
Biggest boss, there ain't no room for me in heaven
I ordered my own morgue with no drawers and no cadavers
About paper without the tree talk, but I embark though
Down the road clairvoyant spitting out my soul until I hear air horns
Until my DJ plays me a Don DeMarco
Shady handed me the baton to run, I took it and slowed down
I took some time to ponder like what am I doin'
Besides undoing what I've done
Or have I become this, another nigga to drop like John's Q son
Or if I become this wild dude who die with nobody's surprise
Like one of Saddam's two sons
Heavy is the head with no crown
Just a mind that can move two tons, times two
They signed you, not me
You got a deal, I got an AK still
So I'd rather Dilla drum like Ma Dukes son
Speaking of moms, my mama told me you one of a kind
Be careful who you're kind to son
They hot for now, but I'm Tucson
Name hold weight, alias built for lasting
The sound of Elliot Wilson laughing is at me
And haunting my rapper conscience
Fear of a fan listening and skipping and going back to nonsense
There goes the genre, it's over
Paul Rosenberg is no longer focused on you
Crooked I been out-thinking me and he still drinking
Marshall telling me don't worry, but he been sober longer
My wrist watch tells a chilling story of frozen karma
It feels like people from my past came together to pray I don't do good
Having a seance in the woods
