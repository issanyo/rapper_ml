[Intro]
*You're now listening to AraabMUZIK*
Random bars, that's what we gonna call this
This is like a thank you
Thank you

[Verse]
Now Ryan's wit is electric like appliances
Now let the flying fist wreck ya, I insist
I'm here to tap some draws, tap some jaws, ballin' that's for yall
I'm here to palm the fuckin' globe like a basketball
They told me I was gold I ain't react at all
I'm stayin' hungry like Em while these ho's act in awe
Fuck money, but tell the government give me some since they print it
I'm a schizophrenic, mental clinic, pencil pennin'
Pimp lieutenant livin' to fight in which if you flinch you in it
Quit your pretendin' you here to be saved I'm simply sent to be sinnin'
Your minds on quitter your vibes on bitter
Check my file my resume is verified on Twitter
Your jeans got a pussy under it
I'll hang up a sign that says your place with a arrow pointin' down and put you under it
You rapping all lies niggas
Misery love company ass groupie ass basketball wive niggas
I been a vet reppin' since Eminem's test record
Which was better then any of our enemies best efforts
An it was just us then, we been the best bet then
We been on top of our green like vinaigrette dressing
You should re-group from the fire
If your killers resemble Keisha from New Jack City or Snoop from The Wire
The only beefin' I'm doing with pussy is screwing
Your crew is in ruins we eat'n an all you doing is chewing
The only swallowing being done is by your girl
You couldn't digest that you probably try an earl
I gotta right hand, it's Debo cold
Run into it playing and end up with Steve-O's nose
I will leave you where you riffing at
Yelling take that, while I click an clack two guns that I nicknamed "This and That"
I play the tune of violence for hours with the same gun that Nas used till I gave you power rewind an listen back
My shit's a mansion, your shit's a shack now check your handguns
We can go tit for tat it's a fact like correct answers
The damn drum'll leave you in the can with your Samsung
Can put a foot in your mouth, without a damn tongue
You plus one on the list at the club with your boy don't give you the right to challenge a pro, you And-1
Nigga I don't got no story
All I know is I'm quick to pop an put that boy in a hole, turn his body to a suppository
While yall hard I'm rolling alone
I get your broad pregnant then I pay to abort it with a card over the phone
If people could endure Royce more, I'm so in the zone
Speak with your indoor voice, boy; lower your tone
So now the sky's the limit
My shades cover eyes that are windows to his soul that's private, ho, mind your business
You're contracts on the table looking like a tarnished napkin
My contracts on the table looking like the Donald's taxes
Yeah, y'all niggas acting real light-skinned
Stick a knife in your right hand
Tell you sit your five dollar ass down 'fore I make change, ask yo' ass what you say nigga? Aight then
Now that I'm(a) pen perks executive I'll call you a *censored*
Draw the line and let you insert the expletive, Nickel!
