Porter, you a real nigga, man

[Verse 1]
It all started with a Starter coat
The starter pistol got us out the momma jokes
The house party finally started, now it's time to go
Get some pussy sponsored by the barber and a bar of soap
I'm stealing cars, it wasn't logical
But on the bright side, they taught us how to drive 'em doe
We used to tilt them bitches with screw drivers
So I'm kinda used to being at the bottom of your columns, ho
But the Billboard list was kinda comical
How the fuck was it designed and chronicled
I can see it now for sho'
Bunch of blas√©s from a buncha artists with a timeless flow
Gettin' trampled over on a 20 year old blogger flow
If 'Pac ain't on your list then you ain't fuckin' logical
I'm talkin' up the shit, not no fuckin' 5 or 4
What you gon' tell me when I tell you 'Pac introduced me to the fuckin' UNLV Starter coat
It all started with a Starter coat
Wonderin' why Brenda threw that baby in the garbage fo'
On my way to cop my navy blue Starter coat
It all started with a Starter coat
The starter pistol kept niggas out here from startin' smoke
Without it I'd be dead or be an artichoke
The 9 iron armor in the heart of gold (it's that fo')
Nobody witchu nigga that's the Art of War (let's go to war)
But do not forget you fuckin' start it doe (that's my mama)
(Woah, what kinda coat is that?) Starter coat

[Bridge]
I grew up with three brothers
As soon as I was born my lungs collapsed
And I had to be hooked up to a ventilator

[Verse 2]
Now a nigga shining doe
Growing up I gave a lotta niggas shiners doe
I gave a lot of people my respect
Daddy taught me that one growing up
He threw me through a shower door
I used to wonder why my uncle looking startled fo'
Crawlin' around all on the ground like his heart is broke
I found out he got a crack problem and he thought he dropped a couple particles
Well I'm a fucking alcoholic so
Who am I to judge, I'm just honorable
I be temporarily in love when I'm inside a ho
I'm a pure artist I don't need to see the charts to know the art is under our control
Highs, lows, problems, pain, drama that's what's optimal
I guess I'm just the best at thanking God and feeling awesome doe
Cause I survived the era of the Starter coat
It all started with the Starter coat
I lost my virginity aboard the fucking Boblo boat
I ain't graduate on time
I ain't go to college so
A couple friends of mine did
Other friends of mine dead
I'm fuckin reminded
Just because I made the most money
That don't mean I went the farthest doe
I hope my college friends reminded
You got degrees that don't mean you the smartest doe
Mo' money, mo' problems
I lost plenty mo' marbles on my marble floor
Then I left in my Starter coat
What they taught us that was all a joke
You may not got a lotta dollars at least you got a post
I'm arguing with Satan screaming "I don't barter souls!"
Please don't take my memories of me and my Starter coat

[Outro]
What kind of coat is that? Starter coat
What kind of coat is that? Starter coat
What kind of coat is that? Starter coat
What kind of coat is that? Starter coat
