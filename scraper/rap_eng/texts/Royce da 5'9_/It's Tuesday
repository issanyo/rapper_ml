Detroit D tattooed on they hand, that's how we do, niggas'll die for this shit. Time to play, check it out

[Verse 1]
Ayo, sit back, smoke, the joke is over, you woke
This is pure provoked "Murder", it's over "She Wrote"
I don't know how niggas manage to sleep
Wake up! The clock radio done panicked the streets
Say somethin! I been waiting now hand me these beats
I'm simply a branch of the Slim Shady family tree
That'll snap, D12 first in line of the wrath, I came last
Bout to put my size nine and a half, in the game's ass
Once I hit the booth I swooped on niggas like "Whoosh"
Two-bit niggas, coupes, and figures we rule
I been vicious, just listen from one track to the next
I was gangsta when rap was nothin but the hats with the X
I sat and watched album for album, niggas flop
Niggas went from pro-black to Italian, I was hot
I worked my fucking ass off, hopin to blast off
Now I'mma let y'all see me, like when Ghost took his mask off
Give you more run for ya ones, packin a full clip
Rapper niggas come witcha guns, don't bullshit
I'mma only give you wild shit, rap with a mild pitch
Only clever with that occasional style switch
Y'all niggas play around on the mic, that's why I'm 'bout to lay it down
Savor they way that you sounding tonight
Because, I listen to y'all niggas records on Fool's Day
Now crack open and bump my shit, it's Tuesday!

[Outro]
It's Royce 5'9"
This nigga know he too cool
But don't ya know ya too smooth
I really love how ya do
It ain't no other like you
(You better wake up, he's coming)
