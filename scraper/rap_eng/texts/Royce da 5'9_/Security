[Intro (Sampled)]
Security, yeah, yeah
Security

[Chorus]
Let me tell y’all a story about somebody I feel was a gangsta
And that’s the very same reason he ain’t here with me no more

[Verse 1]
He marched around the corner like a soldier
But not to get no on-the-mic exposure
To question me, I guess he checking me, I’m feeling like
I’m looking at my own self in the face as deaths destiny awaits
Us both wearing vests’
Us both stressed from the same pressures
Us both fucking train-wreck reckless
Guns whip out, he had a .9, I had a .40
I remember a point in time where he had mine, I had his shorty
And I could cry telling this story
If you can visualize a downtown crowded street, somebody was eating
And saw P pull out his piece and decided to reach

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(Security) Police rolled up
On us like "Police freeze!!"
(Security) Cuffed us up
Like nothing
(Security, yeah, yeah)
Asked us what we got guns for, we told ‘em it’s for
(Security)
"Proof, this one’s for you" "I love you, Doody"

[Chorus]
Let me tell y’all a story about somebody I feel was a gangsta
And that’s the very same reason he ain’t here with me no more

[Verse 2]
He marched up out his house like a soldier
Decided to titty-bar it
A lot of alcohol consumption and drug use
While out with the city’s hardest, niggas
Throwing money up with black face, flicking photos
The only thing he was missing was my nigga Dolo
He decided to leave them and go to an after-hour
After the 4-hour, he act crazier than Scarface after snorting powder
He get into it with this dude, point his piece at him
They say he shot him, problem is, I don’t believe that
And on the real I, only know shots flew
And when the smoke cleared they say he got killed by (Security)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Security) Shot my nigga like that
That
(Security) Probably should watch his back
(Security, yeah, yeah) It’s fucked up, right?
(Security)
"Proof, this one’s for you" "I love you, Doody"

[Chorus]
Let me tell y’all a story about somebody I feel was a gangsta
And that’s the very same reason he ain’t here with me no more

[Verse 3]
I know y’all seen Beef III
And it probably made you think that I ain’t like Shady
The truth is, I was at Proof's funeral crying like a baby
I was sitting in the back row
With Vishis, wishing I can go up to Marshall
Denaun, Swifty, Obie, Bizarre, Paul or Von
And say something positive, after all the negative shit
That we been through, thinking we’d talk one day
If it was meant to reservations ’bout walking up there
And getting in the way, it’s probably better off to just pray
Thinking my niggas a Don, it was my first time
At an over 1000 people funeral with (Security)

[Pre-Chorus 3]
(Security, yeah, yeah)
R.I.P
(Security)
We love you, P
(Security, yeah, yeah)
R.I.P
(Security)
"Proof, this one’s for you" "I love you, Doody"

[Chorus]
Let me tell y’all a story about somebody I feel was a gangsta
And that’s the very same reason he ain’t here with me no more
