[Intro: DJ Premier scratching]
Hip-hop
Hip-hop
Struggle-, struggle-, struggle to survive

[Verse: Royce da 5'9"]
I had nightmares of Joe Budden arguin' with Lil' Yachty
Division between artists, party until we sorry that we partin'
That young man the same age my son is
He just on fire right now, same way that my gun is
They this a profession, do amateurs get rejected?
When Shady made his hit record, could Canibus accept it?
Nah, time just repeatin' itself, '97 just was reckless
Now it's just bigger checks and now it's niggas with dresses
Those who got problems with flows, they can pull up on us
I told Preme we gotta give those "What In The Fuck" moments
This hip-hop, all of the purists be too opinionated
You like it, you dick-ridin', not a fan of it, then you hatin'
You gettin' interviewed by Vlad
You either tellin' a story that's incriminatin'
Or Lord Jamar, (what?) discriminatin'
But white privilege do exist, I agree though
Labels used to tell you what's popular, now it's VEVO
All they argue 'bout now is who is the hottest Migo
Pac and Biggie wasn't just artists, they were our heroes
As far as years, I've been out here movin' for 10-plus
'Cause I'm about the youth movin', not about "Them against us"

[Chorus: Royce da 5'9"]
Instead of wantin' to change everything about me
How come you can't just be the change that you want to see?
You can question whatever you want but never my hustle
Or my everyday struggle, my everyday struggle
Everybody that's complainin' about it not an OG
If you ain't droppin' jewels or givin' knowledge to me
How can I even respect you? Better yet, how can I trust you?
That's my everyday struggle, my everyday struggle

[Interlude: DJ Premier scratching]
Hip-hop
Hip-hop

[Post-Chorus: Royce da 5'9"]
Bitches and alcohol, that's my everyday struggle
Gettin' rid of packs of raw, that's my everyday struggle

[Verse 2: Chavis Chandler]
Fresh out the fryin' pan, right into the hands of rebellion
Both my parents in jail and I got grams I could sell ya
When I was in boardin' school, I was bored as hell
But I learned that the key of life for me
Was to unlock the door to Hell
My skateboard trail leads to dishonest livin'
Designer shit I'm just tryna get it, just tryna fit in, uhh
I'm just tryna get it, just tryna fit in
