[Chorus]
That fo'-fo' goes
Anywhere with me I solo stroll
That power
You know when I solo stroll
You know that fo'-fo' goes
That power

[Verse 1]
Nothing come to sleep as the dreams and regret
Come to a swing of something less than a queen with a catch
Guns and funds and cleaners hoping my cocaina will stretch
I'm blood to the Mexican bilingual who go by "The Gringo"
Who will [?] out the whole scene if you owe and he come to collect
I'm what you call a triple threat
I'm the one writing a rhyme, I'm the one riding
I'm the one rising, I'm the one writing the check
The one with enough respect to make niggas untie ya
Who's living up under the gun
Who will punch your teeth in the street for bumping yo' gums
When I'm finished all they can say is I even the odds
So many lows, some of my highs were even goodbyes
Got so much dough I don't pull out, I just leave it inside
My hat be leaned to the side like Adebisi from Oz
If perhaps there were beef between you and I
You niggas would actually have to sleep in disguise
Fucking with power

[Chorus]
That fo'-fo' goes
Anywhere with me I solo stroll
That power
You know when I solo stroll
You know that fo'-fo' goes
That power

[Verse 2]
Pardon me for being too cool for this foolish industry
The cruel, demented things that I've seen through imagery
Due to the ghoulish chemistry that the Devil has with the smell of cash
I'm a hustler, I hop in the ocean and sell a whale a splash
I'm so hot I can inhale the hash
I can blow the grass until I'm actually impaling hell with ash
Unhappy people focus on all the shit that's missing
Happy people just focus on what the hell they have
Uh, Max Julien coats and ran beepers
Zangief in my hand just as the man reaches
The transcending of grand legions
I (w)rap till I ran Venus or land in arenas, Saran linguist
White hood on the Phantom looking like it's a Klan meeting
And all that hating'll age a nigga like that Japan region
My fam told me my flow remind 'em of 'Pac or BIG
I told 'em "I'm just sick, you can't just go to the doc for this"
Why you out here gossipping? Labels tryna sign me
Despite the fact that I'm strapped like I'm in a zombie apocalypse
Uh, nigga, they can score how they wanna score
I don't always be on the charts but I stay on the boards
I don't do beef, I just make you wear the shit out of this two-piece
Whenever I see yo' ass like Paloma Ford
I don't care if they find you at the game and you on the floor
You gon' get this fucking E. Honda, not on your own Accord
Uh, now let's put this all in perspective here
Me, I'm on the legend tier
You, you on the second tier, you definitely scared
You move like you borrowed the first letter from the word "faggot"
You put effort to put the "F" in "fear"
My pen is potentially grimace the penitentiary
I'm the splitting image of Dempsey
Y'all niggas Ren & Stimpy
Everything about you new niggas is Mickey D's
Y'all niggas tempt me, but even y'all dudes grimace Mickey

[Chorus]
That fo'-fo' goes
Anywhere with me I solo stroll
That power
You know when I solo stroll
You know that fo'-fo' goes
That power
