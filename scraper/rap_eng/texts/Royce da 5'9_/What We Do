[Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, still you lame, high as it be
If I'm ya highness in ya streets, I can honestly compete
Wit any nigga, feel the pain, my odyssey just creeps
Peep a nigga silver chain, no diamonds in the peice
I been chillin on dog for years... now you hard?
I got scars bigger in ya individual career
Who the fuck is Denaun, he don't even write rhymes
Actin like he rap harder then who - the Kon Artis is you
Now you get spoken up on how the heats on you
Nigga you must be smokin and jokin
Slim got 50, and now it's time for change
Shady records lookin like a broke down dollar, you gotta be ashamed
And you can't even stop it
Em got 50 Cent, the rest of you niggas change in his pocket
Don't you niggas see he let you come and get twisted
And you dissin me, but you niggas is unfinished business
SMUCK you niggas tryna be
On every other niggas nuts, in the industry you findin me
From Busta Rhymes to Jay-Z to Nas to ME!
Didn't see me, yet them niggas won't you to rhyme wit peeks
Niggas is HIDIN in the streets, lyin on me
It's funny, cause they paint a picture like I be in TONS of beef
Be out every night fightin, provin shit
Jealous ass niggas, I ain't gotta prove shit!
That means you could die from the felt response
Fear my next move like, Eminem huggin on Elton John
Except Y'ALL playin career Russian Roulette
There will never be another D-12 album nigga, what you bet
Who ain't eatin, I'mma star, nigga, on my 4th deal
I'm so full, I'm feelin fatter then Bizarre
MINUS the shower cap, and them dirty-ass Nike's
Minus the stutter, minus the ugly-ass wife
Y'all don't know what it takes to win, nigga
I'll spar up wit ya boss, we made each other show up late to the gym
So I said it - you niggas is whack
That nigga ask me my opinion, is it true, don't fall for that
Nigga step unto the turf, everybody think y'all WHACK
What you gon' write a diss record to the earth?
You niggas is Shady statistics, the whole world know
Who the broke-ass crew, wit the radio hits is
Warren's niggas is takin ya pictures, you just dummy's
You less money then Slim spends on Hailie for Christmas
I know Slim see the mistakes that he made
Treatin y'all like Dre treated Hittman, and Lady of Rage
Even them niggas is smarter then y'all niggas, the cloth
That I whip my fuckin gun down, is harder then y'all
Ya hustle is over, the rhyme bout is through
I got ya coach on the sideline, touchin his shoulder
TIMEOUT - it's over, it's over
