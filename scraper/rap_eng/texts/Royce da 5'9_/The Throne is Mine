* hidden bonus track; written by Royce for Dr. Dre

[Verse 1]
I can't cater to y'all cause I'm greater than y'all
Baby, I'm like an alien invadin to y'all
Crews, I done proved to all of you's I'm thorough now
(What?) I used to want an island (what?) I want the world now
Dre runnin for king, street politician
Beats one of the things I peeped y'all to listen
Peep how I did it, I took the rap game
Fans came and I established the campaign
Damn shame how all you haters can mud sling
Debatin with the press on the slate that I rubbed clean
Most of y'all wanna be loc, that bugs me
Claimin you thugged out and don't know what a thug means
I'mma shine so long as the sun should burn (what?)
I was meant for the throne from the sperm to the urn (what?)
I don't care what y'all gotta say behind us
Just remember me, Dr. Dre your highness - sing

[Hook (2x)]
It's my kingdom, the throne is mine
I'm back to reclaim what I own this time
Let it be known, engrave it in stone this time
I'm here to rule alone this time - what?

[Verse 2]
Yo, emperor dressed in a robe, iced down
Emeralds and rubies up in the ice crown
It's like a dream full of upcomin events
My wife is a queen, my son is a prince
Tryna breathe life in the heart of this dead market
Walkin on top of y'all, on top of the red carpet
Paid dues, give the world somethin to bump
Make rules with my shoes curled up in the front
Any bad feelings for me toward you sounds fatal
Discussin your death with knights of the Round Table
Passed y'all kids, did what y'all did
Switch the Masion into a castle and drawbridge
A servant for any purpose, Scottish ones
If she see me dressin myself, she probably run
All you hoes callin want us to rap more
Act-ors can fall under the trapdoor
I don't care what y'all gotta say behind us
Just remember me, Dr. Dre your highness - sing

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Y'all niggas wanna see me fail, don't y'all?
Naw it's aight, tell the truth - y'all wanna see me fail, don't y'all?
I keep heat, yo that's just me bein me
And why you wanna see me and peeps, it beats me
I thought I represented better than ever before
It must be cause I used the tec instead of the sword
I'm the type of cat that'll slice a cat
But, you can only do so much in the knife attack
I'm badder than savages and the rest of the vultures
Mad rappers is like court jesters and jokers
I'm the king now and while the rest of you's loc'n
At "The Chronic" tour with tapes beggin to open
Remember this - all you niggas in jeans and hoodies
Either run with me and the team or runnin to me
I don't care what y'all gotta say behind us
Just remember me, Dr. Dre your highness - sing

[Hook]

[Outro]
It's my kingdom, the throne is mine
Back to reclaim what I own this time
Y'all know - I'mma engrave it in stone this time
I'm here to rule alone this time - what?
It's my kingdom, the throne is mine
Back to reclaim what I own this time
I told y'all - I'mma engrave it in stone this time
I'm here to rule alone this time - what, what, what?

Doc Dre, 5'9", run it in 9-9
Y'all thought it was over wit?
Back again, yo
We got y'all surrounded, "The Chronic 2000"
Y'all niggas is done, done..
