[Chorus (Extended): Kobe]
Man, these streets keep on callin' me
Will I ever make it outta here? I
Don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Man, these streets [?] all of me
Will I ever make it outta here?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Check
Man, there's somethin' 'bout that rush that you get when you cut up a brick
When you riding by the narcs right after bustin' a lick
When put that V in park and shorty suckin' ya dick
And you do that shit so much that sometimes you fuckin' forget
It's the way they respect you, the way that they fear you
No one second guess you, when you talking they hear you
There's somethin' 'bout that rubber band 'bout to pop
And dimes try and hold ya fuckin' hand walking out the spot
Everyday's a pay day, you never try and make way
Feelin' like JJ, dynamite in ya hay day
May kick it like Pelé on the stair 'round a way day
Or wake up and say hey, spontaneous vaycay
They mad like [?], you try and find Advil
It's that type morning, you spent last night ballin'
God spoke to me, I know that rap's my calling
But even with these Dre's loud I hear that fast life calling

[Chorus: Kobe]
Man, these streets keep on callin' me
Will I ever make it outta here? I
Don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Dawg
The streets used to have my number back when I had the 15 inch screen
Middle console of the Hummer
Back when I thought it'd be my last summer
Starin' at the burner nozzle wider than a plunger
Where on sight they would expunge ya
Had I stayed I wouldn't of lasted long
Taught me everything that my high school didn't have classes on
Older niggas passed it on
There's a gap in our generations, these younger dudes are saints
We used to ask who was snitchin' but nowadays who ain't?
Had to keep the 4 pound, every block had his own pound
If a showdown where to go down, they'd turn this shit to a ghost town
Lost so many niggas, we could be goin' fast
Honestly, I don't think I'm morning past, I wasn't mourning who had passed
[?] after that life expectancy we don't expect to see
There's a bunch of niggas breathing right now that's dead to me
I'm one of the few that made it out the hood successfully
I lose all my celebrity, all my Ruger’s left with me

[Chorus: Kobe]
Man, these streets keep on callin' me
Will I ever make it outta here? I
Don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9"]
Yeah, Slaughterhouse, nigga
Uh, every now and then you gotta demonstrate
Bust a nigga head for old times sake, look at what those signs say
Welcome to the D, the city that sittin' inside the mitten
You know the crime state where Jimmy Hoffa's body locked away in a safe
[?] time in place where not even time safe
I wear a hoodie to war, they talkin' about me now, "I wonder would he mature"
Supposed to be lookin' for me now, claimin' I'm hiding from you now
Until you find me with my foot in your door
The street said I made a sex tape, no the fuck I didn't
If I did then MTV woulda nominated me for a Woody Award
That's off the topic tho
Niggas walked in my house and went shoppin' in my closet, dog, I'm not the store
With everything I do niggas still shit on me
See Boogie Brown told me, "Get over it, niggas just ain't like you"
So I'ma take her advice and move on from you niggas
Try to move on me, I'ma take your life

[Chorus: Kobe]
Man, these streets keep on callin' me
Will I ever make it outta here? I
Don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
