I'm from a grimy city from a bunch of miles away
With no regard for the laws, I'm from a sovereign state
From a murderous block, swirvin' in a convertible drop
Making sure you heard my proverbial plots
I'm tryna take over the world like Pinky the Brain
My dream mistress is a bitch like Pinky with brains
Or Roxy Reynolds, I'd stick dick into her
She suck cock for a living, tongue kiss with Murs
But I don't feel anger
So like the frame of the nickel plated chrome 4-5
I'mma still bang her
Original renegade niggas still afraid
More niggas follow than Ashton Kutcher's twitter page
Chowder time, ya'll write, I sprinkle powder lines
If Kelly beat his case, my lawyer gon' swallow mine
So put your nines on the crap table
You life gambling I'm Patr√≥n sippin', signed to Black Label
Champagne wishes become realities
Bad bitches fly minus the travel needs
My dick is the biggest thing on my anatomy
I diss niggas for nothing like why you mad at me?
Nickel is definitely still reckless
The last nigga got killed and made me feel threatened
Who really cares what a rapper talkin'?
The only feeling that ain't familiar is after losses
I shoot Edo G in the head and go back to Boston
With a trunk full of white, we call it Asher Rothin'
Feel honored if I talk about your ass often
You should wanna sleep in the bed I was jacking off in
It's a reason these muthafuckas is backin' off him
He Floyd Mayweather, Paul Williams, and Chad Dawson
All rolled up in one his money trash talkin'
Amongst bosses chillin' out in the cash office
Nigga, you testin' the one, nickel second to none
I'm hotter than Texas at three, I'm affecting the sun
I don't just sound raw
I'll disconnect your shit have you walking around with Bobby Brown jaw
And then Whitney say crack is wack
And it offended me like, Fluzey why you dissin my music?
And you can ask Proof, we come from Chopper City
Minus the wack suit, and the beef with Ness
Forever in hell and the smell of that sweet success
That calico talkin', sayin, "We the best!"
I'm a fair teaser
This bitch said, "Who the fuck died and made you God?"
I said "Jesus."
I'm in the zone I feel like a star
And nigga you know what to do if you feel like a fraud
Go on jump in that traffic, you playin' Frogger
I ain't no blogger, I'm Mister Rearrange Your Aura
Niggas thinking all I got is internet soldiers
'09 is the fear year, respect's over
The OG's taught me how to do it one way
So I ain't down for no games unless its gun play
Niggas'll murder judges, over murder grudges
I don't put money on heads I just refer to cousins
I drop dope records that's hot like a furnace
The needle on that record player is hypodermic
Receive food from a intravenous tube
Kill your ass in private between me and you
I'm sick enough to go up in your house
Sickening rhymes, I spit 'em and throw up in my mouth
You fuckin' round with the Slaughter House conglomerate
Like catching your parents fucking, I'll leave you traumatized
A beef live till the drama dies
My daughter could get struck by lightning if I ain't down for homicide
You don't believe in me you a atheist thug
My bitch pussy delicious as the Flavor of Love
Fuck what they say
I'll tattoo your face, Danger but it ain't for the love of Ray-J
I got her card hard, I call my penis "Dicky"
Before I let you bullshit me, I let Serena kick me
And she got thunder thighs
I could just be so heartless and give you the business but I ain't from the Chi
A product of the Borris where Barry Gordy records
I'm talking A.1 Yola, that's totally pure
I flow bodies of water, dead fishermen haunt me
I got the temper of a trigger, the dick of a donkey
I'm a Soulja Boy, yeah I'm the last breathing
No need to turn on my swag, come on, I'm swag sleeping
Ya'll niggas flows is old ya'll sound like last weekend
I'm Marty Delorean partying with a bad reaper
