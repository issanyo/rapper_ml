[Intro: Royce da 5'9]
From as far back as I can remember
Me and my man vicious
We was always taught to shoot for the stars
The game is ours!
Now y'all see it...

[Hook]
Can't nobody stop me (Uh-Uh)
No way to stop me (Uh-Uh)
Can't nobody stop me (Uh-Uh)
Ain't no way to stop me (Uh-Uh)
[x2]

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9]
As long as the checks stay ill
And the records stay real
I will definitely never see how 2nd place feels
I'm a striver
I learned from my father
To burn like lava
I am a survivor
The problem is that
Even as a kid
I would lean to the beat of
Air to the chair of the kings
And I vow to myself that
I wouldn't help
I will rise to the top but empower myself
Can't nobody stop my wealth
My dreams are ?? without my help
For sure it's better than chains on
Or pure competitive nature, waitin'
For the day, we make plans
To compete, win or lose shake hands
These are the views of the dudes
Of tomorrow who will win
Cause they shoot for the stars
And REFUSE to LOSE

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kid Vishis]
As long as the checks stay ill
And the records stay real
Imma definitely never see how 2nd place feels
Got the mind of a rhymer
Conquer your roster
Squad full of monsters as hungry as a hostage
Yeah, I will never fear cause I need to succeed
You can tell in my stare that I care
If I lose I'm a winner
So I move from the vision
Never fool with the ??
Rather learn from my missions (COME ON!)
Can't stop my mission
Two vicious for you
Who step into the trenches
Raw talent never back down
Bring the challenge, imma leave standin'
Laughin' at y'all faces
Cause y'all mad
But dirty looks, will never shake this man
Forced through my head for the cake for the bread 'til I'm fed
Go hard at 'em all
And REFUSE to LOSE

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9" AND Kid Vicious mixing lines]
As long as the checks stay ill [Royce]
And the records stay real [Kid]
I will definitely never see [Royce] how 2nd place feels [Kid]
To lead [Royce] the team [Kid]
Fatigue [Royce] Breathe [Kid]
We'll lead you to song (COME ON!)
For sure it's better than chains on [Royce]
Or pure competitive nature [Royce]
You can lose your shoes [Kid]
In the cruise to bruise [Royce]
Go hard at 'em all and refuse to lose [Kid]

[Hook]
