[Intro]
Be quiet, I know what you thinking, who the hell is that?
You in the club minding ya own business and out of nowhere you here this
How you supposed to act, Neptunes, Royce 5'9", it's my year baby

[Verse 1]
Twelfth grade rode around, started out small
My father told me, before you walk, you gotta crawl
We was all outlaws wit our fists balled
We couldn't even count bars, we was just raw
MCer's battlin' at the club, for the plug
Rappin' for the other rappers, strictly for the love
That was cool 'til my life turned, and got tough
I got a girl, got serious, got her knocked up
Uh oh, reality check, hold up
I gotta figure out a way, to get this dough up
I don't want my son to hate me, when he grow up
So I gotta blow up, and leave it to' up (Five-Nine, baby)
I listened to my pops, whenever it got hard
He said look if you gon' be a star, be a star
I got hot, got a deal took rap
Took the whole city wi me, and never looked back, baby

[Hook]
We can do it now, nigga I'm off parole

[Verse 2]
It's all simple, make a million off the intro
Y'all don't want it, cause you still say ya fin' to
I'm finna blow, like this shit is so mental
That's your life, your problem, and your pencil
Cut the jokes, everybody wanna be rich
You a fool if you don't, you see this
Look at this chain, this bracelet, you hear me
I don't won't respect, I want you to fear me
Now look at me, this shit is getting real now
I want your money, I'mma spit what you can feel now
I tell the truth, so I guess I keep it real now
You thought I was ill befo', now I'm ill now
Come on wit it, I can afford to kill now
Look at my son, ask him how he feel now
It's real now, daddy's got a pill now
Wave bye-bye we out of the hood, what the deal now

[Hook]

[Bridge: Tre' Little]
Detroit came up, you know we hot
30 years where it became a big lot
600s on chrome, you don't stop
Detroit we just hot
Young niggas stay fly at all times
Hoes 21 and under with gangsta rides
Keep our guns by our sides at all times
Detroit we just fly

[Verse 3]
You would love for me and you to switch places won't ya
You love hatin' don't cha, hate just to hate, don't ya
In the clubs yelling loud, like you wanna fight
But I just whisper, you ain't trying to die tonight
I'm the king, yo I'm like the son of Jesus
We got guns, and we'll use 'em, so please believe it
Last had to try me, yeah I looked passed him
But notice he's nowhere around, for you to ask him
Long as I gotta crew, and two in the safe baby
You could scream 'til you BLUE in the face baby
We getting ours, we don't care who in the way baby
Lock and key, ain't nothin' you could save baby
We don't want the bitches dog, we just want the honeys
And we don't want the game neither, we just want the money
It makes sense don't it, the blocks with me
Welcome to the new world, Detroit Rock City
