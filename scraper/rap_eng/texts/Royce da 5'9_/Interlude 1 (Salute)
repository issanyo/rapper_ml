[DJ Premier]
PRhyme. The "P" stands for Premier. The "R" stands for Royce da 5'9". The "H", "Y", "M", "E"—you know the rest. Hip-hop shit. I wanna thank Adrian Younge for setting this whole movement off on the first album. Just in case y'all are late to the party, PRhyme is a concept where we take one artist's sound and then we flip it into the Preemo style. You nah mean? Therefore, now you got it, you get it—let's move forward with AntMan Wonder. PRhyme 2
