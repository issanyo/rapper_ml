Shoot wit us..

[Hook: Royce da 5'9"](x2)
You gon' need a lot more guns to shoot wit us
A lot more jewels to floss wit us
It's gon' take a lot more power to fuck wit us
And a lot more niggas to buck wit us

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm the King of Detroit, I'm the King of the Kings
The King of the ring, cause y'all niggas be swingin the sting
I'm doin my thing, you only worth TWO of my rings
It's you and my team, at war for tryin to ruin my reign
Imagine a thought of that
It's Motown, it's where this black music shit started at
All I did was brought it back
Get it right, I'm over your block and I must succeed
I don't know how much you need, but it's more than you got
These niggas rippin and robbin with the fifth in the closet
Cause y'all niggas ignorant logic got you slippin and dodgin
We bring to a violent halt whatever beef we have
I hate losing, so you'll probably never see me mad
Just here to rewind it back to where time had begun
It's the size of the gun, the trigger and the nigga behind it
I'm the King of the throne, I stood up to sing you a song
To get the platinum plaques back to the city, bring it home

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
You welcome to floss and receive a consecutive loss
All I need's a second to talk to get my message across
Out-of-towners come to Detroit with all they mens
And that's a gamble, you know the house always wins
I'm the savior of rap, y'all wanna be like the third verse missed
Street this, thug that - rhymin my life in first-person
You could never rise, no matter how high it seems
I'm the man with a eye, in the land of the blind of Kings
Trust this, no one could touch this - the difference is
The average nigga brings it to jail, that's why I bring it to justice
My shit be well-thought out, y'all niggas just writin a rhyme
That's why most of the time you bitin a rhyme
I'm simple and plain, quick to speak a nigga in vain
Cause niggas done changed, it's very few niggas with brain
Speak from your heart, and I aim for your chest, I'm done wit it
Y'all rap niggas want your respect? Then come get it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yo, yo, yo.. we must, represent for us
Cause where we from, we eat, sleep and shit Detroit and that's us
Y'all slide by, side by the real niggas
Ain't nothin but stand by to get killed niggas - what!
Tryna make the most of this time, we ain't inside forever
This is life, nobody makes it out alive - NEVER
I'm the King of the throne, I stood up to sing you a song
To get the platinum plaques back to Detroit, bring it home

[Hook](x2)
