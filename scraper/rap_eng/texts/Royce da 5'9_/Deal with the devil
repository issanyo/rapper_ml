//Verse 1:
I think i actually hit a new low, a deal with the devil? No, why did i do it? Im possesed now, fuck it, maybe it will be o.k, ok Lucifer ill play your game, you burn with a flame, tempting people with fame, but its all the same, itt will only last for a short while, until you take the souls, im close to my goals, and nothing will stand in my way
Ill run this shit through May
Im a mixture of whitey ford and mighty thor, i everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Ill run a cord through you, motherfucker!
You can never be my nemesis, you against me is you being a enemy with benfits, i dont even consider myself too deep, when im rolling with 30 homies, cause im so used to being in a syndicate
Boots on with my strap on me
You don’t know how Yeezy the season finna get
Bad and Evil, catch a body, catch your body that’s a membership
Put you on my hit list then turn around and kill up all the snitches
Then turn around and go to church, repent
Then ask the reverend, “Can I get a witness?”
Ha, I got an I.O.U on my Bible’s view
Even God knows what I’m liable to do
When I’m high bro, I represent the same significance
In hip-hop as Pac and Biggie
Driving side car door, 'cept I'm alive though
Best believe I got no problem fucking your bitch, raw
And that mean I got no condom
Panamera Porsche, factory real white
That’s me in real life
And I’ll probably be ménaging more than the back of Meek Mill bike, I’m Hollywood
//Chorus:
A deal with the devil, you are crazy man, meeting up with satan, asking him for a deal. Man thats just stupis. But well i guess im stupid, cause i made a motherfucking deal with the devil!

//Verse 2:
I'm the rawest, uh, rest of y'all just one of a
I’m becoming what I used to make fun of, a
Smug son of a bitch, fuck it though
Going for the fucking jugular
Leave them in a puddle of blood I’m a
Killer, but I'm a cut above the others
Bloody glove in a prison yard, Jodi Arias
I’m coming for you, fuck if the world doesn’t approve
Here I come as a custodian I'm dressed, to smuggle ya
Ass out wrapped up in a comforter come snuggle up with
Another fucking nut, we’ll make a tub of truffle butter
I’ma take this chubby, shove it up that nice round little bubble butt
Make it double-stuffed
Pull it out one hole, put it in the other one
Make a peanut butter cup, bust (yeah)
We can fuck on a golf cart
Tell me how you want it, soft, hard, or fucking rough
Like a dog bark, stop at a Walmart
Get a couple of 50 watt bulbs with a hot tub
Fill up them buns with a hot dog
To be frank these other motherfuckers ain’t even in the ball park
Then she pulled out the condiment drawer
She must heard this is where the condoms get stored
Sign above the door to the sauna says
“Welcome to Sodom and Gomorrah”
Told her I got something for her
Sharp and it’s pointed
And it’s head’s on swole, hold it like a samurai
She said, “Woah, look at that bulge, must have a huge ego”
I said, “Is it me you’re aiming that compliment toward?”
She said, “Yes my ninja, please get to stabbing this shit”
I commenced to dropping them drawers
Threw my black belt and gauntlets all onto the floor
Zipped down my fly, whipped out my confident sword
