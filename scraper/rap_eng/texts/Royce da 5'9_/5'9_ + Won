"It's simple mathematics"

"It's a number game, but shit don't add up somehow"

[Verse One] [Royce Da 5'9"]:
Shout out my nigga Pace
Knot up a niggas face
I play him with a 45 hit 'em with the bass/base
The caliber is a bitch like a judge in court when it spits at you
Perhaps it'll hit you with a case
Sealin' your fate cause you still a fake
Feelin' brave, you've been led astray
Meditate, homies still will pray
On your leather, nigga levitate
Talkin' 'bout you in a good space
Till the metal put you in a better place
Bitch, you only been in two beefs like a set of steak
I'm a heavyweight, I ain't never fake
Dedicated my whole career to beef and bitches instead of cake
But I still got it
30 still wildin' on you
Heard I'm still prolly servin' niggas ill product
Real solid niggas will still kill 'bout him
Fuck how you feel 'bout him

[Scratch Hook]:
"Next to step up"
"Pacewon"
"Rock the spot"
"It's simple mathematics"
"Grab the mic"
"2-4-7 and"
"Keep it hype"
"Next to step up"
"Pacewon"
"All day in my ear"
"Whatever you do"
"When you see us next time punk step to the rear"

[Verse Two] [Pacewon]:
Shout out my nigga Royce
If you try to diss him
I'll flip and rip your lips off and kiss my ass with 'em
Throw you in a ditch and have you missin', I'm the future
Fightin' me is like tryin' to outsmart a computer
I knew that any sooner you would shoot her with a brave heart
I have you scareder than a kid at night in a graveyard
If cats talk smack, I crack they dome
And then chain 'em to a wall like in Black Snake Moan
Like Muhammad Ali, just do my dance
I don't even need chrome, I use my hands
Actin' like Mike in a fight, I start bitin' it
I'll frickin' punch your girl in the face I'm like Ike and 'em
Frickin' raise my voice to the top and start riotin'
Stress you till your body, it looks like you're dyin' in
Beat me in a battle?
The chances are narrow
I get love like Cupid shot me in the ass with an arrow
Won!
