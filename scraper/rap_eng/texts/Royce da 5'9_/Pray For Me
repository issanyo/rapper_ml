[Intro]
This is what it all comes down to, crunch time
Rap - The final frontier

(Pray for me)
Walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I shall fear no man but god
This is my mic
(Pray for me)
My mic is my weapon
When I spit words into my mic, my words are weapons
I'm not a man, I'm a machine
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I seek and find the most blistering cold flows from history
Bitten from over centuries ago
You've arisen the old beats, the liquid mystique
Written robe, village cheap
Illest lyric-beat mixture, relief picture
Lead statistics show souls encrypted with soldier's scriptures in cryptic codes
I am, back from the dead
To show you the words flip-flop from the source
With a hip-hop quotable [???]
I show you my worth, all the way 'round when I play up
I'll see you niggas on your way down, when I'm on my way up
It's only one way to survive, and I chose to do it
Six million ways to die and I chose the music
Shut it down myself, I should've backed when
Should've, could've, 'till I was out, then they pulled me back in
You can never count me out, clear the sorrow
The artist is here today, here tomorrow, long as everybody

[Hook]
(Pray for me)
My past haunts the present and future
I don't even know if I know what I'm doing
I made some mistakes and lost
Only favor I take are never call, even if we never talk nigga
(Pray for me)
My past haunts the present and future
I don't even know if I know what I'm doing
But I know the mistakes, I made 'em
Take this, like it's the last phone call for a favor
Get at me later
