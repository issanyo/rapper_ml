[Intro - Sample from "Sparrow" by Marvin Gaye]:
I used to, singing, baby
Oh, around why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
"You-You good if you know me" - 50 Cent
Around
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Sing about a melody, aww
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
"You good if you know me"
Around
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Anything you want to sing about
Just sing it on out, now, sing it on out
Let the world know what life's all about

[Verse One] [Talib Kweli]:
I stay ill till I stop breathin'
When I attack, my eyes go black like a shark feedin'
If I get too excited rappers start bleedin'
So I sit still and listen to my heart beatin'
I can either be part angel or part demon
Snatch the food off your plate, start eatin'
For us it's cheatin' but of course we make the odds even
We show up and the boushe niggas start leavin'
Yeah, I do it the smartest
I'm the truest to hardest
Nigga ya stupid to start it
I'm a student of Marvin
I learned my lesson, earned my blessin'
Invest in a weapon so Statik select ? blunts to burn in the session
The oldest profession is pimpin' and prostitution which
Leads to consensual sexual revolution
Heatin' them hot things till they singin' in falsetto
Now they undoin' they buttons and pullin' strings like Geppetto
That's why they never let go
Somethin' special

[Verse Two] [Termanology]:
Jeffrey Dalhmer, Ready Freddy, Nirvana
All day, my kicks white like baby powder
You a coward, give you a lead shower
It's ours, me and Stat' the Twin Towers
+I Gave You Power+, this is that Nas shit
My weed sour and I pushed powder
Now I write, DX, Double X
More checks, swallow X, cold Becks
Slow steps, cop shit like Pro Keds
Dame Dash of rap, I push cold vets/Corvettes
So let's get it in for my twins
All my friends in the Benz with their friends runnin' triz
Jacuzzi, movie, the booty twirlin' will move me
My lucy lovin' and loogie'll prove to me she a groupie bitch
Stupid chips in the whip, makin movie clips
Robbin banks with 5'9", killin the music biz

[Royce Da 5'9"]:
Woo! Alright, I'm here, hahaha

[Break]:
Sing about a melody, aww
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Around
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Sing about a melody, aww

[Verse Two] [Royce Da 5'9"]:
Nickel is, Statik is, Term' is, how could you possibly top me?
Them poppers is choppy, lookin like my whole block is a rocky
Me and hip-hop go together like swastika and Nazi
Together like 2Pac and Who Shot Me?
Together like the new President Barack and the hot seat (ha ha)
I'm ever so evidently colder than y'all
Even after y'all niggas go to the morgue
I got a flow like there's no tomorrow
That you couldn't hold or borrow or bite it
Easy said, harder to write it
I got the brain of a miser, heart of a lion
Got the spit game of a geyser, the art of Orion
Y'all niggas losin' weight daily like the real Carson
Excuse the psychology like Dr. Phil fartin' (ha ha)
Lyrical sword that I'm still sharpenin'
AK-47, I'm still sparkin'

[Chorus]:
Sing it on out now
Sing it on out
Let the world know what it's all about
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
"You-You good if you know me" - 50 Cent
Around
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Sing about a melody, aww
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
"You good if you know me"
Around
Around, why don't you?
Around, why don't you?
Anything you want to sing about
Just sing it on out, now, sing it on out
Let the world know what life's all about
