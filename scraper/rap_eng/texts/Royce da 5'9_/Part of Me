[Intro]
You took a part of me with you

[Chorus]
Last night we had a one night stand
But when I woke up in the morning I missed you
You see, all I'm saying is "Can I see you again?"
'Cause when you left you took a part of me with you

[Verse]
It's like it's an urban legend, his mistake
Her confession, how 'bout it for a first impression
How 'bout it, with the Birkin looking perfectly measured
Looking certain as ever like she got her purpose together, whatever
Him? He was like a typical thug
Hat and glasses, he had to bag the baddest bitch at the club
He had a way with his words, a certain – how should I put it?
"Je ne sais quoi" is how the French bitches would mention him
Never known for loving 'em all, having 'em driving his cars
Having 'em in the mall on his budget balling
Him tryna call her is the part of the issue
He said that when she left she took a part of him with her
He ain't a stranger to the one night stand
If you loving 'em, you's a sucker, that's the one night saying
But why give him the wrong number and fuck him later on girls
That's all I'm saying, let me tell you how they met
He approached her with the usual swagger
"How you doing? Blahzay-blee-blah-blah-blah" - the usual blabber
Now that the ice is broken it's time to get linked
He asked her if he could buy her a drink, she nodded to him and said
"I don't really drink but thank you for the offer
Let me buy you one and we can finish talking
How 'bout some Patron, and have him fill the cup up
And when you finish up we can get into something"
He like it's easy as pie, you see it in his eyes
He tryna turn her out tonight and leave her where she lies
Tell his friend he hung her out to dry
Another bitch taps him on the shoulder and he turns around surprised
She said, "How you doing? I think I know you from somewhere
Yes, I do, don't you drive that Mercedes out there
You was driving by me one day I was walking
You pulled over to me and we started talking"
While they talking shorty one grabbed something out her Birkin
Tossed it in his drink and watched it sink to the surface
Shorty number two kept talking like she was tryna stall him
Long enough for that thing to dissolve in
One gives the signal, two says "Who's this?"
He's like, "Sorry, I'm rude" then introduces
One to two – they start hitting it off
Just like he wants 'em to, it's wonderful
He thinking, she's a skeezer, she's just easy
They both probably bi, so this should lead to a threesome
They both probably high 'cause neither one of 'em drinking
They both keep giggling so you know what he thinking
He swallows his Patron shot, sets the cup on top
The bar like we gon' fucking party, don't stop
One cues two then, says, "Where your ride at?"
He says, "Hey, I let valet decide that"
They laugh, they leave, he says, "Mami, drive that
I'm tired or I'm high, I just wanna lie back"
They get to the hotel, they get on the elevator
He ain't feeling so well like "Fuck it, I'll get better later"
They get in the room and start taking off they clothes
Dude stepping out his shoes while he checking out the hoes
He's sick so he sits, one says "Lay down"
Two says, "I'll take off his clothes, okay now?"
He loses consciousness, he dreams of number two riding him
Sliding up and down with no condom
Number one sucking on his dick using both hands
Both hoes dressed like nurses, I guess they role playing
He comes to as the room circles and comes to a stop
He's not certain or not is he still dreaming
He feels numb so he looks down and sees
That he's laying in a tub, full of ice from his knees
To his waist, in a bathroom with grief on his face
He feeling like he too weak to move so he waits
He feels around and notices a piece of paper sticking to the tub
From his bitches and it's written in his blood (What the fuck is this?)
He panics, he screams, "Oh God, what's happening?"
More reading, less praying, no time for rationing
The letter reads, "Never ask for shit
'Cause you can get more than you ask for, we have your dick"
The letter reads, "Never ask for shit
'Cause you can get more than you ask for, we have your dick"

[Chorus]
Last night we had a one night stand
But when I woke up in the morning I missed you
You see, all I'm saying is "Can I see you again?"
'Cause when you left you took a part of me with you
