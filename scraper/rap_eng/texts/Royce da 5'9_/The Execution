[Intro: Royce Da 5'9" & Kid Vishis]
Yo, Nemisis
What's up baby? Bar for bar
The prince, yeah
You know we goin' in right?
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Kid Vishis]
The prince really, sold it out this fourth letter on my head
Or tattered on my hand, the D is in me
You can pretend B but contend with any
For good times I burn my minds like the momma opinion, ah
And I put on for my city Detroit
Me, Royce on tequila you can keep your whiskey
Our pockets never empty cause we rock shows consistently
I'm the shit fool now you will get a whiff from me
I am a rhyming fine tune machine therefore
I'm steps ahead of your thoughts as a human being
I remember when niggas used to hate on the king
Now they admit its his time and he doing his thing
Yeah, lost Proof, lost Blade, so every D mc that's beefin is all slaves
We all remember days in life when the pain came the type of way
That made you pray at night, ah (Detroit)

[Interlude: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, and we gotta shout out all the motherfuckers
Who instrumental in Detroit hip hop
D-Twizzy, my nigga Obie, my nigga Elzhi
Motherfuckin' Black Milk, Guilty Simpson, Marv Won, let's do this

[Verse 2: Kid Vishis]
Say the wrong shit to the right nigga
The right hit you or the bullets coming straight down the pipe just like a picture
Rock City, change the name to Glock city
Pop pop that's the reason why if you not with me
You out scrapping a pound, clapping you a down
Cramping them bullets is bloodsuckers they bout that
They Count Drac' the soundtrack to the now
You clown wack and I'm back with a round hat
My crown bow down or get attacked, strap like velcro, hell no
Fireballs hit you, there's no way to go to hell slow
The things I'm saying they name me Damien and you the Damon Wayons
The game funny for fame shit, your main dame is shameless
She'a take it through the mouth, pussy hole or anus
Thinking she gonna get famous, haha
That's dangerous, jelousy is for weak motherfuckers, is the D motherfuckers

[Bridge: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, that just happen, hahahaha
And that's the victory laugh, hahahaha
Winning! I'm on my Charlie Sheen shit right now nigga
Getting a whole bunch of money, I'm killing you bitch niggas with kindness, goodbye
And go somewhere were its fuckin', sniffle, haha
Fucking lame

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, you talking to Ryan, let me tell you how awesome I am
I slap a faggot with bad acne with a waffle iron
You can catch me dissing who and never get caught replying
It ain't a toss up I just chalk you and toss the iron
I merge together walking and flying
All from buying more Gucci than a waffle cone tatted under an artist I am
I am not dissing, I just got bitches that are the top pickins
The reason why these celebrity niggas get caught with their pants down
Crotch picking, that's not hot niggas!
Since "Writer's Block" drop hip hop's in silent style
Cause without a doubt, I'm the hardest nigga this rhyming out
And I'm crime about when its drama the nine is out
You gonna see more running and stretchin than what goes on inside a common's house
Haha, I got bars nigga, and I don't fuck with you
Signing out sincerely, the fucking Gucc, haha

[Outro: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, that just happened, that just literally happened
Shout out my nigga Trick-Trick the OG, my nigga Shady, my nigga Wine
This is the Bar4Bar Mixtape by the way, Kid Vishis
I'm just representing money
I mean literally, literally, representing money, haha
God damn man, I do this victory laugh so much man
Ha, Shady Records nigga! Gracie pride nigga
I feel bulletproof today, today
Prolly cause I spit with the illest killers in the business
As a matter of fact I'm getting in the booth with the GOAT in the morning
Who the fuck ya niggas rapping with though?
Whats up with ya'l movement though?, haha
This the 2.0 boys year niggas, 2.0 boys nigga
Ah this shit is black history
Iâ€™m out of here, Im'm tired of this shit
