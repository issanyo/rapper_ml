[Kenny Seigel]
Let's get this lyrical murdering under way
Put these niggas way under, no delay andale
Make these niggas lay under
Dirt, the undertaker's taking over
No wonder they getting ate by the eighth wonder
What you saying sorry like apologies
My poisonous bars got toxicologists
Analyzing my anthologies
Can't harm me, why pop at me
It's like﻿ I got hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy
Why box with me, harder to hit than a lottery
Why bother me, kill cats like curiosity
We enter the place and niggas shake like they naked strippers
They hate these niggas because we make figures like a pottery
Y'all upset me like a nun who's bad
I'm deadly with my one-two jab
I can punch through, gun proof glass
Kill shit when I wreck, Conrad Murry
I'm responsible for this mics death

[Julius Luciano]
Allow me to put this in perspective, check it
That was Bar Exam One, allow me to quote from the second
Nigga there gotta know, nobody as hot as me
Got a dragon's heart, boy I'm so Sean Connery
The four-five pop'll give your whole squad lobotomy
My snub nose in the air and the chrome shotty gotta be conceited
Bring life to rhymes I'm creating
Bust hard on a track before it stop ovulating
You say you sick come see me, the rhyme doctor's waiting
My occupation is to off my patients
It's not augmentations when I put something in your chest
And yep, tools fucking you up like a botched operation
I let them slugs go free, my Glocks not enslaving
My bullets nigga, pull the trigga from my tool and thin ya
Niggas hear my Glocks proclamation, bullet emancipation
Every hot shot's a statement

[Andrew "Dice" Deniro]
Shoe-gang, they loot for they loot
Quick gunners you ain't got a shot when they shoot
To the grave I'm a walk around with the trey deuce
Die with my arms out like I'm trying to be Jesus
I'm gigantic and quite manic and accurate when ever I blam it
That's the reason these niggas panic
Get it right, I'm disgusting around mics
Like Yahtzee this game is nothing without Dice
No matter how many thoughts I leak on cheap(?) tapes
I can never fully drain my massive think tank
Play me the best, I bet I'll eat what he can't
Even he'll have to mark my pictures my speech paint
We mobsters, rocking rocks and goat
Nine tick toking, watches, cocking rides and fighting(?)
Popping optics, squashing squash with problem
Y'all can't stop these cobsters, that's preposterous

[Demetrius Capone]
I'm a spot light villain
Diamond heist I'm shine stealing
I must be Christ-like cause your wife she like kneeling
If looks could kill I got you in my sniper sight
I'm ice thrilling like my ice grills in
Erase you like ancient Mayans
Escape from an insane asylum
I'll make any atheist and satanist praise a tyrant
I'm scraping the sky be height a giant that's named Goliath
When I stomp the continent brakes creating islands
In honor of Obama's inauguration I'm enslaving Republicans
I stuff em in concentration
Camps I'm Osama and I'm a racist
I hate the human race so I'm wasting the population
I'm an ape and I'm crazy as dominatrix and Dahmer raping his momma to spawn an abomination
Wait, give me the﻿ safe's combination
I'm Tyra Banks brother Bobby
I rob banks with the face of Ronald Reagan

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Y'all bitches should call Nickel the Don Bishop
The poet, a mixture of Don Go and some John Grisham
The flow will have you rewinding four-five times
That landmine rhyme written with porcupine lines
Step up here with the horseshoe
COB gang we them folks who will
Bend your gun barrel to a horseshoe
Only fuck with monsters, we the true monsters
I pop up on you like you said Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I can't even see the both
I can fit in Stevie's shoe
I'm sick, I've got that Desert Eagle flu
I'm rich, little nigga we don't need the set, Teflon
The doctor tried to take blood the needle bent, ask mom
Fifty percent of you niggas is punk bitches
I fuck with real niggas
Real niggas that want weight but don't want fitness
Vision a horseshoe is all I could see, shit
Me and Crooked I done let the dogs off their leashes

[Outro: Royce Da 5'9"]
Just let it ride
Just let that shit set in
Let it resonate in your brain, fruit
