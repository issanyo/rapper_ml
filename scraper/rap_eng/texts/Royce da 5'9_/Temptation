[Sample]

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Yeah, I need it, I want it, forgive me my heavenly father
The demon inside us is seemingly only get stronger
A scene in Nevada with Yeezus and thousands of dollars
Things we encounter, put penis inside a vagina
Gynecology, I am not the normality
Nor manometer, rhymin' with namaste's not an option
I'm getting posh and impatient I'm sick of waiting
I'd rather [?] with Satan while overtaking temptation
Frustrated when people say that they made it
Go posting photos [?] their paychecks
Straight flexin', I'm rippin' right through the latex
Fetish for flesh, can't blame me hating safe sex
Just couldn't do it, the cutest [?]
My living room is a nudisty colony I recruited
I do it for [?]
Don't go and screw up your youth, I'm sayin'

[Hook: Royce da 5'9"]
We doin'
Na-na, it's goin'
You don't like me then oh
My family doin' so
We just doing our jobs you know we do it so
Na-na-na-na, we do it
Got your bitch sayin'

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Na-na-na-na, shoot 'em
Nickle and N-N-Nottz come and stop what you doing
And we ain't feeling your boys, I'm lyrically Jigga with poise
And Nottz is J Dilla on 'roids, pow
Nigga, we doing so well
You take the bitch shoppin', I take her to a hotel
I float like a butterfly, sting like a sting ray
Everyday of my life's a holiday, Green Day
It's killing season with pens, knocking down summers
It depends, either the Benz or the brown Hummer
Alligators and snake skins the [?]
My closet look like it's owned by the crocodile hunter
From the D, the north [?] and Europe niggas
They tried sleeping on us so we appeared in their sleep
I ironed out my shit, gave them niggas a crease
So let the spirituals speak, I'm a lyrical beast

[Hook: Royce da 5'9"]
We doin'
Na-na, it's goin'
You don't like me then oh
My family doin' so
We just doing our jobs you know we do it so
Na-na-na-na, we do it
Got your bitch sayin'
