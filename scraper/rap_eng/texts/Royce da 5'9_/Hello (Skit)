[Hook: Melanie Rutherford]
Hey, get 'em up
Hey, get 'em up
Hey, get 'em up
Hey
See, who the hell is this?
Calling me in the morning
Who the hell is this?
Calling me in the morning
Who the hell is this?
Who the hell is this?
Who the hell is this?
BITCH!

[Verse: Melanie Rutherford]
You do not know me, but I know you
I've been at your home, sexing your man
He is not happy when he's at home
I am his one thing, just so you know
Girl let me tell you, I am old-school
You played your part and you knew the rules
You classified as one thing or two
I am his wife so don't be confused
Girl let me tell you just so you know
You are the streets and I am his home
Don't confuse lust with something so pure
If you call again I'll be at your door
Don't make me act up, up out the rage
See I am a lady so have a nice day
So who the hell is this calling me in the morning
Who the hell is this calling me in the morning

[Hook: Melanie Rutherford]
Hey, get 'em up
Hey, get 'em up
Hey, get 'em up
Hey
See, who the hell is this?
Calling me in the morning
Who the hell is this?
Calling me in the morning
Who the hell is this?
Who the hell is this?
Who the hell is this?
BITCH!
