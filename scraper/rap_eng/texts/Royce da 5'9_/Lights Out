[Intro]
Daddy, turn the lights out
Now you can’t see me

[Hook]
Spinning, spinning, round and round
Drop the needle, soak in the sound
Prepare to listen, don’t you dare turn it down
Do me a favor, turn around, and cut the lights out
Oh cut the lights out
Oh cut the lights out
Like a fairytale, cut the lights out

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9]
Yeah, drama can come one, come all
We ‘bout it, some rise and some fall
But, us fall? We doubt it out
We stylin’, G tops and candy paint
Me and vicious riding side by side, we lookin’ like the gumball 3000
And we boundin’ toast wine to this life
Singing Michael Jackson, Paul Mccartney the girl is mine to the white
And when the time or when it’s nice, I tangle with my own criminal mind
I’m in the bind but, I’m only intertwined with the mic
‘Bout to take it back to when rapping was immaculate
I’m here ‘cause of my acument, flying off on the tour
Now I’m in that dirty mansion looking at my bags
A bunch of bitches in here vacuuming and I ain’t talking about the floor
May my next move be my best move and may these bitches never bounce
And may they keep coming like my checks do
And may father time order me another round
As your mind keeps spinning around in this smoking lounge

[Hook]

[Bridge 1] (x2)
We’re going back in the basement like back in time
When we looped the record, let it run
And write a rhyme, like the days of way back
The days before trap, the days before any record contract
We’re going back

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]
Today is a new day, to find the old way
Of how we used to be when we’re alone
It’s been so hollow and full of sorrow
We’ve cut each other right to the bone
You remember, our first December
Stayed August in that basement, you and me
Although it’s hazy, we’re still that crazy
My pool of youth is that basement, you and me

[Hook]

[Outro] (x4)
Time keep on slippin’
Take a second, just listen, nigga
Auditory and visionary
Take a hit and just keep on tickin’
