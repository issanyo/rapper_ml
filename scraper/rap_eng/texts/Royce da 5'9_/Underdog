[Interlude: Chuck D]
I'm Chuck D, giving hip-hop's state of mind back
Lazarus, we played him last week
We're going to play this
Out here in Detroit
Royce Da 5'9" also recorded with Lazarus as well
Been one of the most powerful interviews I've heard
What we played last week with Lazarus

[Intro: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah yeah
Royce Da 5'9"
I'm upin here with my man, Lazarus
Yo Amir
Next time you knock somebody's fucking head off, I want you to think about these verses
IV, what up, my nigga?

[Hook: Lazarus (& Royce Da 5'9")]
People see I'm from the D and say that I ain't nothing
But I turned around, flip the script and made something
I'm me, now let's run it back on them
They tried to take me for a slave, now I own them
(People see I'm from the D and say that I ain't nothing
But I turned around, flip the script and made something
Of me, now let's run it back on them
They tried to take me for a slave, now I own them)

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Back-to-back platinum plaques, switched my car from white to black
After Charleston switched it back to black
My rapping style is acrobat, mixed with a private plane
Fly even while I'm plain, come to bars, I don't talk
I sound off thunder thoughts, I will give you all a running start
Anytime, three sixty-five days, try me
Or y'all may want to keep throw [?] or somersault
Look dog, I'm not not underdog, I pop to put your dog up under tar
A headstone, some grass up under stars for rapping at the one
Smiling at you while you're howling at the moon, and how so long
I'm laughing at the sun, laughing at the fact I'm fucking like
A rabbit having fun, and you ain't having none
And ask us now the rabbit got the gun, and I don't need no explanation
I try to keep my past behind me, fuck my recent destination
You dissing me for my attention, you won't be getting it undivided
Cause I will come divide you to five hundred degrees and separate you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lazarus]
Check it out, now picture me the underdog
Unknown whose hunger claws, jugulars ruptured, crush his jaws
Feeling the blood in my surgeon galls, pause
I came from nothing and caused an eruption
Put my hands in these racks and gloves, then I became Gennady Golovkin
Without an assumption, I'm like a hybrid, it's preposterous
As Rakim, and the Indominus, Rex our perplexion
Raise the spirit as our possession from the village of Sargodha
Here comes the twist of a rollercoaster, chase me but you can't catch me
When I'm repping like Furiosa, furious as a Sosa
Apocalypses, a narcissist, my arms and wrists are twisting
Write my bars like I got Parkinsons, against the odds [?]
Better myself, I'm profiting
[?] and rose up on there chessboard and they got the king dropping all competitors
On any verse, I'm rep for my city, my home is a symbol for overachievers
And those who believe us that we are the leaders, the congressmen and senators
I slay who slaves his masters, I'm the prey who preys on predators

[Hook]

[Outro: Royce Da 5'9"]
They try to take me as a slave, now I own them
