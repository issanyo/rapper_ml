[Hook: Just Blaze & KXNG Crooked]
You gon' get a lotta' people mad, you speakin' lotta' truth
You gon' get a lotta' people mad, you speakin' lotta' truth (Why you mad?)
You gon' get a lotta' people mad, you speakin' lotta' truth (Why you mad?)
You gon' get a lotta' people mad, you speakin' lotta' truth
Oh you mad 'cause I'm stylin' on you

[Verse 1: KXNG CROOKED]
I gave you niggas the truth, huh? Huh?
And what'd you do with it?
You ignored it and bought a bunch of fairy tales, huh? (uh, uh)
You niggas losing it
I coulda' did it for the mainstream (uh, uh)
Nah, I wasn't cool with it
Truthfully, I never thought I'd rap like Common Sense
But I woke up my people, been rapping like Common since
The hood is moving different than you envisioned
Consumerism's the new religion
There's fewer Christians and fewer Bishops reading them Jewish scriptures
A slew of bitches with shoe addictions and niggas who truly risking it all for the coupe if the roof is missing
On a foolish mission
What if I told you I knew the system wanted the future spending their youth in prison
Who would listen?
No time to listen to dudes who spittin', while music's missing
Just booze and women, your jewels are drippin
But you was trippin', because your jewels have nothing to do with wisdom
You stupid, ludicrous, nigga
You's a victim (Amen)
We lost souls, put that on the bible
Sell us some Jordan's
We'll be ignoring distorting on what's important
Even though there's been a war on the poor
Before they was recording, Jordan scoring titles
Me and your survival was more than vital
They say my people are like Jelly Beans
Wait!
Because nobody like the black ones
Unless it's our culture, then they like everything
Wait!
I tell the truth, I get attacked, huh?

[Hook: Just Blaze & KXNG Crooked]
You gon' get a lotta' people mad, you speakin' lotta' truth
You gon' get a lotta' people mad, you speakin' lotta' truth (Why you mad?)
You gon' get a lotta' people mad, you speakin' lotta' truth (Why you mad?)
You gon' get a lotta' people mad, you speakin' lotta' truth
Oh you mad 'cause I'm stylin' on you

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]

Tell the truth nigga who the best in this industry
If it ain't Crooked Kendrick and Cole bitch then it's me
You only acting tough 'cause you sniffing coke and sippin' Hennessy
I click triggers re-lentlessly
I kill rich niggas instantly
While I'm here I'm fucking all your little bitches
All I said to that little thot was hello back
Marshall called me the best out, I called him the kettle black
I'm like Nas I'm about the check
My cars is parked in an underground garage like Das FX
I'm about the deposits like I'm in debt 'cept I'm not in debt
I move in silence and I don't move
Inside it unless I'm protected like contracepts
I'm a Contra-vet
Thought you got me my sign was wet
God just wept
I'm the flyest yet
I'm disguised as Ness
Your brides is bare but your skies in nest
I left my deposit slip on the Gaza
Strip while I was checking my connect
Yes
I confess
I don't rap for checks
I rap to kill rappers and for my respect
I shall let this nine go pyrotech'
Lies gon' catch up and guys get lied to rest
I confess, shit don't go right, then I go left
We not friends, do not flinch like Tourette's
I'm on yo' head
Like berets
I'ma show up where you did your show last
That's gon' be yo' ass
I don't get you there I come to yo' ave
I don't get you there I come to yo' lab
Show up frontin' like I'm drunk with the MO-AB
I'm a seasoned Slaughter House general ya'll the beginners bro
If I'm starving you know I target your dinner bowl
I'm a part of an augmented envision in God's image
Part of a team that brings all the women
When I'm stepping wherever they got to check the weather
When I'm summoning summer brings autumn winters
I'm too up to understand what under means
Anytime I'm coming it's humbling to all contenders
Male or female we can bet your budget
I got asked in a interview where did I think I would
Be if I wasn't in this bitch being the best who does it
That's easy I be somewhere else being the best who does it
