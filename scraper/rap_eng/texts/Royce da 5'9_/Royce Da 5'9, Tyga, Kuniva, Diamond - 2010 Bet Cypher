Intro (Royce Da 5'9)

My name is Royce Da 5'9
I wanna introduce to y'all my lil' homie Tyga
My homie Kuniva and my girl Diamond
It's going down!

Verse 1 - Tyga

[Verse Two] [Royce Da 5'9"]:
The day I stop droppin' the hotness
Will be the day I'm driving in a Datsun with 50 Tyson and Antoine Dodson
My Wikipedia
First rapper to make media take out for takin' out someone from the media
I'm somethin' they wanna censor
Somethin' that comes from inward
Makes me wanna call Dr. Laura, Mel Gibson and Doggy The Bounty Hunter a bunch of N words
I gotta admit it I'm kinda corrupt
He's a machine till I wire him up
I make his whole damn team Transform like Shia Labouf
Rappers can be talkin' about who's hotter
Tryin' to get Montana Fishburne fame I make him Cube's father
Watch me I'm comin'
I got a baby Cannon on me that's bigger than the one that Mariah got in her stomach
After me there will be no more
The black Phantom got the all black Fantasia Barrino doors

Verse 3 - Diamond
Fresh off maternity leave with no stitches
Nine months off to birth you broke bitches
Whip game sick my flow is so viscous
Pit off the leash my bite is so viscous
Y'all fictitious name just irrelevant
Iâ€™m the real deal y'all just surrogates
And they wonder why I'm so arrogant
Cause I'm a mouse in the room full of elephants
32 flavors, pussy so tasteful
Pussy so good make a nigga be faithful
Y'all should just thank me, all y'all mimic me
I raised you bitches, all y'all Mini-Me's
Marc Jacobs, Mac makeup
I cut checks while these chicks get checks cut
Gonorrhea flow, so the shit can burn
Show my ass off- Montana Fishbourne
