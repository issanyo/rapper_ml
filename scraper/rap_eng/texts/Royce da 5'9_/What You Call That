[Verse One] [Royce Da 5'9"]:
Same aim through the chest
Same game ludicrous
They ain't sayin' who the best, they ain't playin' Budapest
Who the Kane? Who the next?
I'm scared of that, this is compared to that
Lyrical, Vicious the heir to that
I'm like a camera catchin' you talkin'
Like Miramax, talkin' shit after you park you goin' be aware of that
I'm feelin' like Cassidy, spark ya, beware of that
Yeah, I'm raps Ashley Parker, been There And Back
Now he's nasty, if she's with me then she's classy
She's as bad as can be but I keep her knees ashy
Nigga, I'll make that clique sit up, she make my dick spit up
You make my day, you keep her wrist lit up
You a Louie bag buyer
I'm the 'Push The New Jag Until We Crash Until The Tags Expire'
So recognize fire
Recognize the best rapper alive until who we have retire
