[Intro skit plays for first 42 seconds]

[Hook: K-Young]
I got a thing for your girlfriend
She got a face of a goddess, ooh-wee, you already know
Don't, d-d-don't blame me
Don't, d-d-don't blame me
Excuse me miss, I'm just passing
Hope you don't mind me asking
Are you lookin for some action?
Cause I wouldn't mind waxing that ass

[Verse 1: K-Young]
And it ain't easy, understanding
That your shorty may love ya but I'm surely gon' fuck her
Tonight, I know that it's risky but I'm a bit tipsy
And I can do what she wants, she fiend the life of a baller
Shit, she want it all, I'ma give it to her all
Give it to her all, give it to her all
All that, I'mma give her my balls
I told ya, I'mma get in them drawers
I just love the way she use her body-ody
To be the spotlight of the party
You ain't got what it takes to keep her away from me

[Verse 2: Royce]
I got a thing for your girlfriend
She freakier than a mothafucka, ain't she?
Now I don't love no hoes, but I love yo's
She make that cock blow, swa-la-llows
Everywhere I look and, everywhere I go
Your bitch wanna get with me, I can't tell her no
Confront me about it and see the hammers
You better off ambushing us with the "Cheater" cameras
Your bitch bad with her thick ass
Up and down, sucking me so fast she can get whiplash
Laugh, I'm the original
I send her back to your bird-ass pigeon-toed
Shovel that pussy, dig a bigger hole
I'm loving that pussy, I call it the centerfold
I'm digging Keri Hilson
I'm looking at Mariah Carey pictures, ay Nick!

[Verse 3: Royce]
I'm all about my paper
Pathetic cash, I'm calling out your better half
Bet it, I'm shooting premium gas, leaded
Bet I could wax that ass without ass betting
Now let the realness set in, really
Bitch I'm illy, hotter than the Denaun milly
You probably happy tonight, but after I strike
You gon' need to fit your bitch with a tracking device
A Ho-Jack, your ho vulnerable like no strap
You on a Mountain rocking a Brokeback
Haha, you faggoty acting
While me and your bitch is engaging in tragedy passion
Pass me your ex
I'm tryna hit Kim Kardashian now, and then Cassie is next
Diddy you wrong, I feel bad for Ryan Leslie, I woulda at least said
