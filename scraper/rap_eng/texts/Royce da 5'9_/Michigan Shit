[Hook: Jon Connor]
My city, my hood, my clique, my town [4x]
Real niggas say some'n, real niggas say some
All the fake motherfuckers be quiet [3x]
(I do this shit for who?)
My city, my hood, my clique, my town

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Look, fuck niggas be quiet
Where the real niggas at? Gon' point 'em out
Fly City if a nigga talk shit, shit else to talk about, word
You prolly wanna reconsider ya image when you in city limits
I figure a nigga wanna continue livin' or on
Pretendin' like you killin' when you in the city of niggas that really did it
This that shit, niggas wish they could bottle it up
Now my motto is "Ain't no motherfucker following us!"
Give me a medal, nobody hot as me give me a shovel
So I can dig my way to hell so I can battle the devil
Who on my level, ho? Guess we'll never know
Cause I be murderin' everybody you put up on a pedestal
Better but get better with every flow
Michigan niggas nobody comin' with better flow, niggas know

[Hook: Jon Connor]

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Yeah I'm special, y'all motherfuckers basic
Y'all walk around wearing Asics
Me, I walk around in my two's and my three's
On my Jay shit (Both J's)
Listenin' to '99 Problems' with 99 problems
And each one of 'em a fake bitch
See, that's how a nigga get when a nigga go
From being real broke to getting fake rich
Okay, you get no breaks, in the city of Detroit
Unless you breaking out this
If it wasn't for my Instagram I feel like
I'd be wakin' up everyday wasting outfits
So feel me cause I'm felt as fuck
And I ain't never with the clown shit
If I ever looked down on the next man it was just for a second
When I helped him up so the next could get down, bitch

[Refrain]

[Outro]
From the 810, to the 313
And the 810, yeah nigga that's all I know
Yeah nigga that's all I know
Yeah nigga that's all I know
Michigan shit, nigga
Jon Connor, Royce 5'9"
Don't nobody do it like us nigga
