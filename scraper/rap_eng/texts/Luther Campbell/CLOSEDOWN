VERSE #1  (KULZEE)

I take first step out of my door, All that’s on my mind is making dough
But I never do business door to door, I just pick my phone and make the dhow
I see this n***z come and go,  Cause this game wasn’t meant for you
Am back with the classic meant for you,  No one can reach this level you all
Cause the language I speak you never spoke, The things I see you will never spot
The places I have been you will never go...Cause this p** ass n***s never grow
Am taking it all...Now I’m greedy, Want it all..Now I’m selfish, Kill them all...
Now am filthy, Follow this regime if you feel me...


Chorus	(KULZEE)
Now, put your hands up, Let me see you wind hard....
Back it up, Just bounce with the track      x2





VERSE #2                   (KULZEE)


Just bounce with the track shawtry shake it some more
Whenever you want some imma give you some more
I show you respect like saying shikamoo
I see them girls getting wild on the floor... Imma make tight ass go loose on the floor,  Bounce them asses like no pants
Make real G’s blow their pounds, Watch out you all... Hear this sound
Sound like am taking over now, All mic’s is murder now, Get in its thunder now
Closedown it’s darker now, Look!
Shwarty shake it hard like she’s on moon, Doing dirty things like she’s a goon
Or like Arabian she has mariuan,  She feels so high like high in marijuana....



Chorus
Now, put your hands up, Let me see you wind hard...
Back it up, Just bounce with the track      x2


Bridge;  (KULZEE)

Closedown....  put your hands up...Let me see you wind hard...  x4




VERSE #3  (KULZEE)
The beat never stops and I will never stop flowing, Just like a river on the hill flowing
Get all these birds flying on me, Feeling so good like their my babies
Lights gone off we need some candles, Lets party hard go home without scandals
Can’t do high shoes???, Get sandals...,  You want some roast food???...Go nandos
Back to the bizz..., Bungers all time, Back to the streets... Holla anytime
To all my chicks... Wigle anyhow...You know what it is Kulzee in the house
I smash this place like nobody else...You want to say some come say it to my face
You want to know what I earn Break to my safe, But you better be keen before you end in the cage...



Chorus               (KULZEE)
Now, put your hands up, Let me see you wind hard...
Back it up, Just bounce with the track      x3
