[Verse 1:]
Stop
Let's take this real slow
Let me break it down
So that you can know

I'll do things
You never imagined me to do
I'll lick you all over
As the sweat
Pours down on you

Girl I want
To lick you up and down
Come on and let me do
What I can do

Come on
And tell me what you need
Cause I just want to
Taste the sweetness
From your body
Let me

[Hook]
Come on and let me lick you up
Come on and let me lick you down
Come on let me lick you around

Up and down
You will feel my fire
Let me lick

Come on and let me lick you up
Come on and let me lick you down

It'll be right

Come on

[Verse 2:]
Every little touch that I make
Will be so nice, girl
{You know what I'm gonna do}
Lady, lady, lady, lady

First
I'll start from your toes
And then I'll make my way to your thighs
I'll make you so wet
That you will never let me go

How about we get to know my boy Shazam
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I'm feelin G.I

Dino will make you feel the things
That will make you
Feel so right

Up and down
Come on and let me do

And tell me what you need, girl
'Cause I just want to
Taste the sweetness
From your body

Come on and let me lick you up
(Come on and talk to me)
Come on and let me lick you down

Let me know what you want
And I'll just do it

Come on and let me lick you up
