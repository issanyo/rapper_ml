[Intro: James + Luke]
What's that?
It's the metronome. It's like, making sure I'm on beat

[Verse 1: Luke]
Met this girl in the club last night
My, my, she was a hell of a fine
Guess you could say she was my devine
Rolled up to the beach in my Kobra 69
My girl blazing in the sunshine
She was handing out too many signs
I knew I had no choice but to make her mine
Flew her back to my place in South Caroline
Funny thing was, her name was Little Miss Caroline
We flew on my main boy's private airline
2 days later I woke alone
All I had left were my washed away footsteps in the sand
She left me a letter:
Said she hoped to see me some day
So I filled it up with grass
And I burned it
For Rage
