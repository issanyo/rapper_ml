(Fresh Kid Ice)
Listen party people let me tell you this;
Something I know you can't resist;
We came here tonight to let you know;
That we are crew gonna steal the show;

Cause the time is now for you to see;
How our crew came to be;
So get on the floor take a chance;
This time you get to dance

(Mixx scratches)

The rap new year's our claim to fame;
So everyone in hip-hop will know our name;
With Mixx on the tables, the kid on the mic;
Gonna to give everybody what they like;

He's known in California as a sensation;
With a style of mixing, he's taking the nation;
Every time you see him it's a treat;
Cause one thing he never does is lose a beat;

(Mixx scratches)

He cuts so quick like the Jam master;
He scratch so quick even Egypt ain't faster
Than the "Treach DJ Mr. Mixx";
With a quick hand-speed and a bag of tricks;

He's a one-of-a-kind guaranteed to play;
All the new jams that's out today;
With the Kid on the mic you can't be stopped;
C'mon Mr. Mixx it's time you...

"Rock" [Mixx scratches]

We got two MCs who are down by law;
We got so many rhymes you never heard before;
We don't like to brag or even boast;
But, people like our rhymes from coast to coast;

Like Luke Skywalker, I got the force;
Wherever I rhyme, I am the boss;
'Cause I'm one MC who do it all;
Anytime I battle, I will not fall;

I'm 5-foot six got a mellow voice;
To show you why we the people's choice;
We're the 2 Live Crew saying goodbye;
C'mon Mr. Mixx end it with style!

(Mixx Scratches)

Treach!
