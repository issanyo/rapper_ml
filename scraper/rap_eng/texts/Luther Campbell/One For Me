There was a lonely lonely place that I used to know
It used to lie way down deep in my soul
Until I met this fly guy we caught each others eye
By then I knew that everything was all right

Talkin 'til dawn everynight I knew that it was love
Can't help the feelin that we're feelin it keep growing strong
Spend every minute holdin hands, I got the perfect man
Brought so much joy back into my life

Since the day that I first saw him
Can't stop thinkin of him
Right then I knew that he was the one for me
Maybe we can do that somethin somethin
Can't stop thinkin of him
Right when I knew that he was the one for me

Girl let me tell you 'bout his style, with his gorgeous smile
Oooh...Skin so chocolate, I wanna lick it...drives me crazy
I can't see no other lady...but me
Huggin and kissin on my baby
Oh how I love it when he share his fantasy
No doubt his momma raised him like he's 'sposed to be
I'm feelin him, he's feelin me
And that's the way we got to have it

Since the day that I first saw him
Can't stop thinkin of him
Right then I knew that he was the one for me
Maybe we can do that somethin somethin
Can't stop thinkin of him
Right when I knew that he was the one for me

He shows me he loves me like no other
Without his love don't know what to do
And his touch is a little bit of heaven
I know we fit together 'cause...

We side to side like two turn tables...Right?
Jumped in the mix and hooked ya up like cable...Right?
How we do that put food on the table
Nivea's hot... plus we on the same damn lable...Right?
You like my favorite sandwich with no mayo...Ma
I like yo thuggish ways and that's forreal...Ma
And after ballin I'm callin you on the cell...you busy?
Then hook up the steak and potatoe

Since the day that I first saw him
Can't stop thinkin of him
Right then I knew that he was the one for me
Maybe we can do that somethin somethin
Can't stop thinkin of him
Right when I knew that he was the one for me
