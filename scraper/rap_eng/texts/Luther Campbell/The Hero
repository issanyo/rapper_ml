The Hero is the one who responds to the call to adventure


[Interviewer] With you there is a get on your knees and go to work. I mean, those are a sort of instructions that make it seem like you're [?] during sex


[Luke] No, no, no


[Reporter] They're really crude, crass


[Reporter] Grade? marks follow the music industry for Spin magazine


[Attorney] This represents nothing more than three men trying to exploit the sexual conduct to make a buck. That’s all it is


[Interviewer] Uh, but I think would it be
Uh, but I think would it be inaccurate for you to say that you’re a businessman first?


[Luke] Oh, yeah, definitely, I mean, you know, just like you say

[?] OK, Kevin. Let’s stop it there


[Luke] I’m gonna take this home with me and I’m gonna play this to my dog
