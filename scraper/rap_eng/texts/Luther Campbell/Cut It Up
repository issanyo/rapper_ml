Hey! Everybody you got to see…
How a DJ should really be;
Cause when you're at a party and you're ready to jam;
All other DJs need a helping hand;

I know how you feel;
It's like you wanna die;
Get with it;
Give ours a try;

He's always on a pedestal above the rest;
No, shame to his game cause he gives his best;
So when he's at a party the music never stops;
Cause Mr. Mixx is here to cut it up…

I must give credit where credit is due;
And, at the same time, make known to you;
Because when you see is when you will believe;
That there is not another DJ with cuts like these;

And, I'm not making false accusations when I'm saying…
He rocks the house every show he's playing;
And, with the addition of a rapping technician, somewhat quite like myself;
Enhancing all the cuts he makes, and keep his mixes in perfect health;

So, for those who never seen and for those who have;
And, for those who don't like him, well, it's just too bad;
And, for those who try to diss him because of his position;
They talk smack behind his back because they want to be down with him

He's Mr. Mixx better known as Dave;
Sent many-a-DJ to an early grave;
When it was a battle or just a fight;
In the bright of day or dark of night;

Cause he's always ready, willing, and able;
To rock sucker DJs on three turn tables;
But, don't forget, the drum machine;
Which enhances our sound, make us sound so clean!

One, two, three, hit me

Take a second for the record and a minute for the sense;
Cause the Treach DJ's name is sure to be mentioned;
When you're talking about the DJs that are out today;
In your conversation, you will say;
He possesses the gift to be so swift;
Naturally great and talented;

He knows what he must do to rock you;
And, I'm not lying when I'm rapping cause I'm rapping the truth;
He's my good friend and partner in business;
So won't you cut it up def, homeboy…yeah something like this…

[Mixx scratches]

Say what…Yeah…
One, two, three, four, hit it (x4)
