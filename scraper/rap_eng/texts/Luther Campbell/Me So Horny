Said, "Yo, this Marquis, baby! Are you down with it?"
I arrived at her house, knocked on the door
Not having no idea of what the night had in store
I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warning
I have an appetite for sex, 'cause me so horny
Ohh me so horny
Ohh,Ohh me so horny
Ohh me so horny
Ohh,Ohh me so horny
Girls always ask me why I fuck so much
I say "What's wrong, baby doll, with a quick nut?"
You can say I'm desperate, even call me perverted
But you say I'm a dog when I leave you fucked and deserted
I know he'll be disgusted when he sees your pussy busted
Won't your mama be so mad if she knew I got that ass?
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warning
My appetite is sex, 'cause me so horny
Ohh me so horny
Ohh,Ohh me so horny
Ohh me so horny
Ohh,Ohh me so horny
Ohh me so horny
Ohh,Ohh me so horny
Ohh me so horny
Ohh,Ohh me so horny
You said it yourself, you like it like I do
Put your lips on my dick, and suck my asshole too
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warning
My appetite is sex, 'cause me so horny
Ohh me so horny
Ohh,Ohh me so horny
Ohh me so horny
Ohh,Ohh me so horny
Ohh me so horny
Ohh,Ohh me so horny
Me So Horny
