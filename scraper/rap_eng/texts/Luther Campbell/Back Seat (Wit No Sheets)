[Intro: Stick]
G.I., Shazam, Hey yo my boy Dino
Oh yeah ha-ha I'm Stick baby, and I got yo back yeah
H-Town beatin' down yo door for the 9-4
And this one is definitely  for the ladies
Check It

[Verse 1: Dino]
While I got you ridin' in my 6-4 with your body layed to the door
While your legs catchin' sun from the window
Girl you know I'm bout ready to go
N'I see you lookin' at cha tick-tock
While I ride straight by the bus stop
Every girl wanna be in your spot
Well damn it's a good day

[Hook 1: Dino]
[Shazam and G.I.] Then I go to park
Then I stop put the breaks on (Shhh) Hush, don't talk
[Dino] Baby, and come a little closer to me
[Shazam/G.I.] While we slip in the back seat
[Dino] Oh baby cause I know and you know
I want your body in the back seat, wit no sheets

[Chorus:]
Do your body in the back seat
[Shazam/G.I.] Why?
[Dino] Hell, cause it's sexy, so sexy
Baby don't you know it's sexy

(Repeat)

[Verse 2: Dino]
I'm gonna ride let the fellas see what I've got
All the fellas ridin' my jock cause I've got the dopest girl on the block
She is so fine, she is so dope
Got body like fame got Bob Hope
All I wanna do is just ride
Slip in the back seat, wit no sheets

[Hook 2:]
[Shazam/G.I.] And I go to the park
Turn the radio up loud
[Dino] While I knock them boots out
[Shazam/G.I.] Kickin' in some H-Town
[Dino] Now you know what's goin' down
I want you in the back seat wit no sheets, baby

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
In the back to the North Side
In the back to the East Side
In the back to the West Side
And I can't forget about the South Side

[Chorus till Fade/Dino]
