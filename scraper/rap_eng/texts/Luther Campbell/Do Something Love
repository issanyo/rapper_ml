Everybody's war cry everybody's pride
Anybody's soapbox anybody's lives
Everybody's problem everybody's gun

Nobody's daughter nobody's son
Anybody's country anybody's blood
Anybody's body anybody's gun

You do something hurt
You do something pain
Why don't you do something love for a change

Why don't you do something love [x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love [x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love [x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love [x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love [x3] for a change

Give me a sign that I'm not on my own

Everybody hides everybody cries
Anybody wanna look me in the eyes
Somebody's conflict somebody's cause
Nobody asked for everybody's loss

Somebody listening somebody care
Somebody do something somewhere
Anyone listening anyone care
Somebody do something somewhere

Why don't you do something love [x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love [x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love [x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love [x3] for a change

It's only love gotta give it away
Why don't you do something love for a change

Why don't you do something love [x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love [x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love [x3] for a change

Why don't you do something love [x3] for a change

Give me a sign that I'm not on my own
