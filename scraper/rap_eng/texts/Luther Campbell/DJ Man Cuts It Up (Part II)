[Intro]
Yo DJ Man, are you ready? (I'm ready!)
Are you ready? (I'm ready!)
Are you ready? (I'm ready, i'm ready, let's go!)
Party people in the place (Yo)
I'm here to say (That)
My DJ (Yeah)
Goin' all the way

[Verse 1]
Well, he's no quiet storm, and he's not no joke
When he's on the turntables he goes bezerk
He's comin' through, so get out the way
I'm not talkin' about me, it's my DJ
Using his hand, takin' command
Like I said before, he's DJ Man
The tough DJ that's comin' through
Homeboys in the back, tell me what'cha gonna do

[Verse 2]
He can't be beat, he's on a tour undefeated
When you hear him cut, it's just best that you retreat
Sittin' on the throne, in a class of his own
The jazzy females don't leave him alone
I'm not grabbin' on my man, but you know he's (Fresh)
And when he's on the turntable, he let's the crowd go
When he's on the cross-fader, his hands move swift
They movin' so fast, they can't be played with
You know he's tough, he's DJ Man
He has the two turntables, it's where he stands
You sucker DJ's will fear him, when you'll hear him
You know he's devastating, and you can't get near him
The best man reppin' on the wheels of steel
Slicing it up, 'cause he knows the deal
The M-A-N, I won't say it again
For all you sucker MC's, who want to be my friend
DJ Man is on the mix, you can't forget me
'Cause i'm the MC dominator MC Shy D

[Verse 3]
I see you paid your money, to hear us play
So we gonna get down, with no delay
'Cause in first place, that's where we'll be
DJ Man, and myself, Shy D
We are the two on the top, we can't be stopped
And if you ever try to battle, you'll be dropped
We don't play games, you know we come correctin'
And all the crews out there, give us most respect
DJ Man is tough, he don't say much
Comin' comin' through, we'll be caught in a clutch
'Cause super party rocker, DJ upsetter
When he's on the cut, he's gotta get better
Cool on out, picture what I say
My DJ, is goin' all the way
'Cause he's a tough DJ, that's on the top
And when he's on the turntable, he can't be stopped
So Man, it's time to settle the score
Show them what you're back there for

[Outro]
Now all of y'all, you must confess
That my DJ, he is the best
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hah!
Yo DJ Man, cut it up DJ!
What's my homeboy's name?
Kool Collie in the house
'Cause 2 Live Crew is coolin' out
J-E-C, rock, fillin' the house
Auntie Anne, rock the house
To my mellow Luke-Luke, rock the house
Yo, DJ Man Homeboy, i'm breakin' out
