[Jadakiss]
Yeah
Yeah, fuck I'm talkin' 'bout right here?
Niggas ain't ready
Knowhatimsayin?
My nigga P
Kiss, c'mon

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
Livin the life, steady keepin it tight
Never take a funny nigga's advice
Pimpin the game, never trippin on fame
When I'm done you'll respect my name
The vision is real, time will reveal
As I pack the steel
Treasure I found, with the platinum sound
That no other can put down

[Jadakiss]
I take a lot of advice, my lifestyle's product and dice
And guns that'll target your pipe
It's sorta like approachin the don, wrong word, wrong vibe
4-5'll leave most of you harmed
Move coke through the ocean, paid off the coast guard
Sailed out to Cuba, made sure shit's potent
Violence with caution..
And ain't too many niggas you know that got pilots transportin
Egg nog whip, four door Ferrari
2 M-16s's, I beg y'all flip
I'm the hardest nigga you know, check it out
Turned 40 ki's to 80 when I get in the door
So I flash like cameras, blast like hammers
I worry about y'all lil' niggas just like your grandmas
Get shit jumpin like the playoffs
Every twenty minutes a day give or take I knock a K off
Been in the hood for real long
Catch me anywhere and I got a half a mill' on
Jada, kiss you now, you die now - why later?
Double R and Violator

[Chorus]

[Prodigy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
P and Kiss y'all don't wanna miss this
That's two ghetto-ass niggas on the same shit
We the two best you ever gon' hear in your life
Appreciate this shit; Infamous Records and Double R
Nigga Cadillac trucks and bikes
Mac 10's go off, P that young boss
Blue bottles'll pop champagne and dutches
Hundreds of that Branson, honies what's happenin
Yeah, come thug it with us, we rugged and rough
Out the box brand new shit for you to get crunk
Heavyweight bars and hooks for you to turn up
This is that gangsta shit the world'll bump
This is that major shit, we burnin up
Keep your ear to the street and you gon' listen to us
Pull up my V is crushed, I blew up the spot
Wit the twenties that keep spinnin after I stop
When my bunny step out the car e'rybody watch
When the Lambo' doors lift up, faces drop
Somebody daughter fin' ta get fucked tonight
Cause we fillin up the cars and the trucks tonight, what

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
C'mon, yeah
Uhh, uhh, yeah, yo
Niggas is lame and they ain't firin back
And I don't understand how these young boys be admirin rats
But don't worry 'bout Kiss, bein a snitch
Only time I drop a dime when I'm leavin a bitch
Am I allowed to hit 'em?  These thugs that's actin
Like slugs is awards and they proud to get 'em
Nigga how dare chumps; put the pumps to the back of they neck
And pop 'em just like air bumps

[Prodigy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
OK let's bang nigga, the fuck you thought?
P wet behnd the hammer, you get blammed up
Guns'll shut your mouth, and fuck you up
My dunns'll raid your crib and rape your slut
We them real live N.Y. niggas
We don't play, dead real boy, stay in your place
'Fore I put skirt on you; a wood box with some dirt on you
You gotta be kiddin my shottie be spittin
You hittin light poles tryin to get away from me
The Continental T'll wrap around a tree
Fuckin wit P, yeah that brand new exclusive shit
A polka dot whip, with blood burgandy fits

[Chorus]

Violator.. Violator nigga, what?
