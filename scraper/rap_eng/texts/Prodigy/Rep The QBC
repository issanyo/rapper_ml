41st side

[Hook: Prodigy] X2
Prodigy, Rapper Noyd, H-A-V-O-C
Rep The QBC, eyes on my enemies, exclusive
'96 introducin', (Yea y'all)
The Infamous Mobb, word to God

[Verse One: Havoc]
To all them niggas, reppin' they hood, it's all good
It's all good, 'til you step out of line
Went in the dome, out of sight, you out mind
Some like chrome, bag a bitch like phone time
You phoned them, I regulate, who am I?
Havoc and Prodigy, will go back, like go blind
'96 combined, put on all the people, we all shine
Every mother of the clique created

[Verse Two: Prodigy]
Yo, meet the heavy metal king hold big shit, with spare clips
You see the clips when the mac spit your top got split
Layin' dead with open eyes, close his eyelids
Turn off his lights switch to darkness, it's deeper then the abyss
Its street life, blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
You'se the wild child, kid cold turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power leave my mark on this planet
The Phantom of Crime Rap, niggas is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth like Guinness
POW niggas is found, MIA
We move like the Special Forces, Green Beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in eighty-nine, the same way
The God P walk with a limp, see, but simply
To simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me you must be bent G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to be empty
The reason why it full for so long, cause I don't waste shit
You properly hit, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it
Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs, claimin' that they gon' rob the Mobb
When they see us, I tell you what black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take these missiles
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryin' to make CREAM and that's that
Whatever it takes however it gots to go down
Four mics on stage a motha'fuckin' four pound
Speakers leakin' out sound and niggas leakin' on the ground
I could truly care less the God gon' get his
Regardless blow for blow let's find out who hit hardest
This rap artist used to be a - stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point, never diss
Regard shit or forget the essence, from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the birds
Live up to my word
If I got beef, niggas comin' in herds
We flush through your clique, get purged

[Verse Three: God Father Pt. III]
Yo, see niggas lookin' at me
With evil eye, crooked eye
Dunn I know why
They despise, see we rise, kill a wise guy
My enterprise Cartel, we instill
Black steel on a hill
With Mobb scale, my whole fleet keep it real
The raw deal, to bail, destroy, conquer
Rarely wonder, like the sky, like thunder
Keep fightin', strike land like lightning
Increase power, solar, mind controller
The title holder, upsight when I'm sober
I stay bent, cherry eye, chocolate scent
Intelligent, vetern and cheddarin'
Mostly all time auditin', it's on again
Stick you with my devil horn again
Born again, wild hooligan
Pollutin' in a city near you
Comin' through, The Infamous Mobb nigga
Whatchu gon' do?
