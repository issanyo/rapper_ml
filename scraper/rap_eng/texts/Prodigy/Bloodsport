[Intro]
Turn them heaadphones up, yeah
To my man Nigga-No, yo, Killa Bee, no doubt

[Verse 1: Havoc]
I kick that progress and to that dumb nigga God bless
I know you can't sleep or rest behind that bullshit
Now you rock a vest, scared to death while you walking
Fuck the talkin, we straight up, New Yorkin
We blowin niggas, heart attack stroking niggas
Provoking niggas, shittin all over niggas
You rollin thick, but yo the Mobb rollin thicker
Get that liquor, turn your back ice pick ya
But fuck that, stickin with the gat is quicker
Scared to come around my corner, you ass nigga
Do it your way all day, fake shit
What you gonna do outta town, play bitch?
And run like a faggot switch take the whole shit
And show the world don't sweat it baby girl
I gotta hem and pull the gat like a stem
You all fucked up like a offbeat blend
I send messages that you couldn't read clear
Try to play the front but you got stuck in the rear
Take it as a letter but I'm not sincere

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Yo, this ain't rap, it's bloodsport
Your life cut short,  you fell short
The pressure's on high, full court
My team form killer instincts and fire arms
Dangerous thug minds and brainstorm wars
A life of a wild rebel, who run wild
Click (Blaow-blaow) Nigga lay down, queer stay down
P a disappear in hydro cloud
While you running at the mouth a hundred miles, I'm out
Mobb Deep style from the depths of Hempstead, get ninja'd
I creep quiet, keep the live nigga inching, listen
Who are you to throw your fist in? Hit like a bitch
Run like a faggot and take the whole shit
That's it, I had to pass here with the shit
It's time for showtime, let's see how deep things get
You want to talk tough and get all delinquent
You find yourself all bloodied up and shameded
Me and my man pioneered this violent nigga rap shit
Bust a gat, give me no fear of that, I'm laughing
What's up there? Let's take you there and touch something
I'm a maniac, brainiac, fanatic for that
Capable of combat, P counterattack
In some hot wheels, sending shots out from the back
It was a foul way to go, Kicko
You know the ropes so (Bloodsport, mothafucka)

[Hook: Havoc]
Ayo, the rottweiler, chewin chihuahua ass niggas
Pull em on your collar and let the lights dimming
And you'll be swimmin in a puddle of reality juice
Fatality too, this rap shit is the bitch you shouldn't married into
To the set of prenuptial, got paid and too comfortable
It's all good, read em on the humble
And while you shinin in the spotlight
I got this dot right, the aimed right a stoplight
The trife life, ain't no part two's
When it's over it's over you hit, now send your soldier lease through
