Ayo times is hard
But we get thru em
And even tho its crime involved
We had to do em
By any means
Malcolm x marks the spot
I went from riding bikes to riding through in a drop
The road to success for me
Was real gritty
Wasn't no stress for me
Dont feel pity
Life is a bitch and she sure ain't pretty
But ima do me anyway nigga
Cause im from New York City

I break bread
Ribs
100 dollar bills
A young prodigy when it come to Drug Deals
In New York i get blood money
Dirty Cash
Brought my matte black jeep
I Use to skip out on cabs
Went from giving no dough
To given limos
To get to shows
Either way I'm Driven
The Shit Shows
Spit flows
Like boat sick hoes
Yacht master Rolex watch above my moe
Drinking champagne out da bottle
Young Crisco
Poppin
Hop in
Lets politic ditto
Same niggas sayin time to get this money
Been the same niggas saying that for years
Still hungry
New Discussion
New York Artist wanna be Southern
The city lost
So outta towners find themselves frontin
There was Biggie, Jay Z now Troy Ave's after
Kendrick Lamar jus a weirdo rapper
