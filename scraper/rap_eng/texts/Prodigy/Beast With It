[Intro]
I came into this game, game, game
I came into this game, game, game
I came into this game, game, game
I came into this game, game, game...

[Verse 1]
I came into this game, a shortie, young and ambitious
Feel like they turned me into a monster or beast with it
Now, all I hunger for is more money, more bitches
More people listenin' to my shit, pay attention

[Instrumental Break]
Feel like they turn to a monster or...
Feel like they turn to a monster or beast with it

[Verse 2]
Pay attention
This time is ours, we made this for all y'all
I make my own rules. I don't follow, I shot call
We do this for the underprivileged and the outsiders
Put your hands up, we're gon' take you higher

[Instrumental Break]
Feel like they turn to a monster or beast with it
Feel like they turn to a monster or beast with it
