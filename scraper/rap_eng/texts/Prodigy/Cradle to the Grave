[Skit]

[Produced by Havoc]

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Forever wild from the cradle to the grave, kid watch your back
One time's comin' always (Yeah), they lock me up for 12 days
I can't comprehend, now I'm a free man on the streets again
Chasin St.Ide's down with some Seagrams Gin
Life is like a dice game and I'm in to win

[Verse 2: Havoc]
On the scene from the 41st side of Queens
We get the cream, laid up, love-love redeem
Cause I mean what I mean, I'm out to claim king
Doin' my thing, throughout states my name'll ring

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
To all my peoples locked down comin' back to life
In the world once again though ya' bid was trife
While you was gone, we was goin' to war
And even more, saw my man layin' dead on the floor
Kid I swore that our crew will live forever, I guess I was wrong
No, until we meet again hold ya' head and stay strong (Yeah)
Yo, got my mind on a place to hide from police (Where?)
Sweatin' dogs as I'm runnin' cross 12th Street
Just as I approached the block, I spotted Jake on the creep down by Vick's weed spot (So what?)
Made a U-ey up the hill plus a change of plans
I had to hurry back so I could warn my man

[Verse 4: Havoc]
It had me stressin' little somethin'
Had my heart rapidly pumping
Niggas started cutting behind the bushes ducking
My ears rung, I plunged a clip into the guns
Got grazed in the arm, one slug hit my son
He was bleedin' from the head, I couldn't believe it
We was defeated, if it was a case I couldn't beat it
Felt like cryin', (The temperature's risin')
I saw my man helpless, damn near on the verge of dyin'
So to P I passed the iron

[Verse 5: Prodigy]
Kid you ain't lyin', I went to stash the murder weapon
Plus I'm relyin' on a door to be open
Goin' in the building, it's a trap
Police buckin' at me, they try to twist my dome back
Jetted up the staircase to the third floor
Reached behind the sink, throw the heater on the floor
Locked the door, police grabbed me up and tried to break my jaw
Said, "where's the gun we saw? (I don't know)
We know you was there at the homicide scene(I don't know nothin')
And if it wasn't you, it was somebody from ya' team"

[Hook]
From the cradle to the grave
(From the cradle to the grave)
(Straight from the motherfuckin' cradle to the grave)

[Verse 6: Havoc]
Yo, it's the real drama kills
Nobody move, stand still
Body you, drop that ass off in a land-field
Son bless me with the iron I got beef with some niggas from the other side over some weak shit
Load up the heaters, greet 'em with the hollow tips
Flip 'em like the Gotti clip, my crew shift the body shit
The cradle to the grave is where I'll end up
Fuck gettin' sent up North son, I'm bent up
Doin' my dirt on a low, fuckin' with the Mobb is like a trial
No doubt you gonna' blow
You never know
He didn't even have to go
There unprepared now he's six below
Y'know I'm chillin', I gots no time for catchin' feelings
Get that money I wants, some brothers wanna' act funny
But it's all good, I still die for the hood
For my peoples, yeah knock on wood

[Verse 7: Prodigy]
Triple L, rollin' dice while I put you on
To the drama what I gotta' say is short not long
This nigga that I'm beginning to dislike he got me fed
If he doesn't discontinue his bullshit he might be dead
You know him well and probably go way back
But I don't care if he's your man doin' shit like that
I hope the word gets back to him, cause I'll screw him
He shitted on my man and we got plans to do him
Lets get it over with quick, I'm tired of waiting
Ainâ€™t no fear over here, dear, we just debating on when and how
Later or right now?
Spoke to Killa yesterday
He said to chill for a while
But it's hard acting like everything is alright
Get the chills when I see that nigga in my sight
A dead man walking, not only that he's still talkin'
About how and what he did very often
You don't know how much I fiend to put his ass in a coffin
One day my man and the next he's not
Didn't know him long anyway, so fuck it
It's funny how things change (Word up!)

[Hook]

[Outro: Prodigy]
Word up man!
Y'knowhatumsayin,we gonna die!
It's for real,kid,no games bein played
