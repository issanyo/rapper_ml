[Havoc talking]
Yeah we stop fuckin with theses niggas
It's real... it's real... yo

[Verse 1: Havoc]
This money done got a nigga like me in trouble
I made it niggas hated leave me dead they beloved to
Mommy before I walked up out that door I should've hugged you
Who's my real friends seems I'm livin in a bubble
For cryin like a bitch nigga get your fuckin firearm
Got me blowin hollow tips right at your Teflon
Nigga stick and move if you ain't gettin stepped on
No heat? That's like a cop without his vest on
We buggin constantly thuggin we ain't showin no lovin
Ice griller than sluggin face the repercussion
Niggas stomach is touchin it's real not for nothin
Keep fakin and frontin you know it's gonna be somethin
They say you live and you learn niggas never will learn
Burn heavily burn when streets and music merge
Niggas comin at me sideways
Nigga get your hammer and let's do this the right way for real

[Hook: Mobb Deep] + (Havoc)
