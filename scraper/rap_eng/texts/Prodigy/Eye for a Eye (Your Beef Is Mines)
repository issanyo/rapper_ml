[Hook: Prodigy]
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list
Know wha'mean, Hav, situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya, and leave your corpse
For the cops to discover, while I be pimping in the Range Rover
All jewelled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes trying to knock me and lock me
But I'll be on the low sipping Asti Spumante
Niggas try to creep on the side of my Jeep
Stuck the heat through the window rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack, it was a small thing really, yeah
But keep letting them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm out of town one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours and your team's inferior
You wanna bust caps I get all up in your area
Kidnap your children make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got cheese in my pocket hit off my main squeeze
Push back the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
Through the butter soft leather upholstery
But mostly, keep the gat closely cause niggas wanna toast me

[Verse 2: Havoc]
A-yo I gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences
Count all my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the gat, let my nine serve purpose
Sling, do my thing, organized fiend service
Trying to make a mil is stress you know the deal
So we sling krills, get your cap peeled, cause everything is real
Cause I wanna chill, laid up in a jacuzzi
Sipping bubbly with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort get caught
Dead up in New York, my brain is packed with criminal thoughts
Get your life lost never found again my friend
Mission completed, watch you drop in less than ten
On my road to the riches, hitting snitches off with mad stitches
Your last resting place'll be a ditch kid
No one can stop me, try your style's sloppy
You want to be me, you're just an imitation copy
My theme is all about making the green
Living up in luxury, pushing phat whips and living comfortably

[Hook: Prodigy]
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines

[Verse 3: Nas]
A drug dealer's dream:
Stash Cream, keys on a triple beam
Five hundred SL green, ninety-five nickle gleam
Condominium, thug dressed like the gentleman
Tailor made ostrich, Chanel for my women friend
Murdering, numbers on your head while I'm burglaring
Shank is serving 'em
What's up to all my niggas swerving in New York metropolis
The Bridge brings apocalypse
Shoot at the clouds feels like, the Holy Beast is watching us
Mad man my sanity is going like an hourglass
Gun inside my bad hand I sliced trying to bag grams
I got hoes that used to milk you, niggas who could've killed you
Is down with my ill crew of psychos
Nas Escobar moving on your weak production
Pumping corruption in the third world we just busting

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Hold up and analyze the wildcats slang cracks
They swingin Ac's, the new routines, be my eyes black's
Playing corners glancing all up in your cornea
Corner ya, seen cats snatch monies up on ya
But late night, candlelight fiend with a crack pipe
It's only right, feeling higher than an airplane right
Word yo, I want to get this money then blow
Take my time, blast a nine, if you front you go
Sip beers, the German ones, hand my guns to sons
Shaolin, and Queensbridge we robbing niggas for fun
But still, write my will out to my seeds then build
Mahalia sing a tale but the real we still kill

[Hook: Nas]
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines

[Outro: Raekwon]
Laid back, word out
Jus' bless 'em, with the bulletproof
Mobb Deep, Nas, Chef creation
For yo' nation, YEAH!
