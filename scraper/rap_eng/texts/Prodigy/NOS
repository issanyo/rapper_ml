(Intro)
CT: You're a fiend.Stop it

(*NOS can opening to begin the song*)

(Verse 1)
Fiend yes
I get rid of problems with this addiction
A terrible team of real Freinds
Who's pendulum of pens
Keep swimming
With the current while you tense in the past
Facts in science
You live a fiction
Of diction words that never come to pass
While I weigh 71 kilograms of Anti+Stan Mass rotating like propeller fast Mister laid you out with a acapella yeah
We packing tons with our tongues pressured past the point snare the neck of a hare
Hip hop running away that's a devil I won't dare wild got the Harvey dent hair
Coin flip if I'm done and sign out back to the lair
Peep the brunt psi slam THEM
Ain't a rock band but on the metal grind
Running on this track dig into this sand we so fine
Just our friction will burn you down to the gland   OWW cannot grip us with your hand
Run to Sam
Lamb named a son of God
And can't act like a man
ODD damn you loopy and fruity
Like the tucan
And a small scam no new trick like the dame the fox sham
I land and bam found the bound hound drowned for barking too loud in others land
You got tukes on in Tucson
Berating you hot on the heater stand
Can't understand what the crews on
Cold only cause parading made
Hypethermoters mercury
Froze yo

(chorus with Mister)
We've been in this you know were on top
Is your name christian your finna get crossed
Your are on a mission but you are just lost
You know we are the motherfucking bosses
Taking no losses we be balling with knowledge
And you finna get criss crossed kid

(TOW-G)
Kid,Skid fuck with it

(Mister Verse)
Sub-statuses fuh days its nothin but shade, ya numbnut butstain got blood that runs plane, comin up tuh us better be in tough shape, remember that time we got you fucken baked hahahhaa

Skoden, hope you don't hide like you snowed in, ya hopeless rodent, knowin no limits you bringing no potent, showins of mind, short of the rhymes, looking at your page and I'm bored everytime, sometimes you sound like your snortin some lines, I'd end your career but abortions a crime, uhh not really but my morals are dyin, I'm pourin the rhymes way more than a tried, but only cuz it's too easy, all your shit is just too cheesy, youre digging your hole too deeply I'm asking please believe me, when I say that I don't wanna straight murk ya, but people ain't wanna hear you mersure, (word) aight let's go again, I got showmanship

You more of rabbit ain't holding no magic, I'd mow you in half and then oh itd be tragic, rowin a paddle I ain't showing sadness, cry me a river your flow is all backwards, can't smoke on no backwoods at least not with us, ain't sorry were gifted valisnavida, funny to us that you rant and you rave, we runnin this shit yet you pant when you pace we shat in your face laugh youre last place, but you eat that shit up like it was crab cakes, youre having bad days, go back to the playground, just like your words you weigh like eight pounds, but we gotta ton of em heavy as fuck, this last one is simple you're petty as fuck

(Interlude)

(Verse 2)
NOS NOW rush top STOP
MY BRAIN SWITCHED ON
BURNING A HOLE THROUGH BAR'S OF IRON
WE'VE BEEN IN THIS FIRE ALL NIGHT LONG

Impose as I compose
This verse pick you up by the toes
Like the Mario cloud we don't care about your daily woes tallying
Put you back on track but still dillydallying
While tattling so stick with rattling boomerang Studio drag call it a facial to gag can't spit with camels born with backs full of ammo
Talking smack won't get you jack and neither will Camo begging with a bag full of leggings that's a stretch we banded like rubber but got real bands hoe
Spill on a pill Jill got burnt blunted to burt I never wanted 2 faced jail came back wretched so get kicked out for real
Like inuk baseball get lost and go fetch a real deal you're messing with the real deal peel or kneel
When you attack
We pass it forth and back
Like a hackey sack middle of smoking cess no stress we hippies leave you with the stitches ripping and you gripping
Your hair beware the nanuq stare rush em if when they panic in prayer dip out if you dare
You all legs like a chair
Running from a schooling like you had a spare
The smoke cleared you a mess like a duck dynasty beard and flat weird dreary Like beedie don't come near me leave the query you've been waiting for this beating serving the cheque for this beef unnerving you'll pay much more than you're earning plus respect surely this is burning you up like your crotch 9 months ago when you bumped a hoe then she duck CT spouted off when the city called you a no go bro woah what's with the ego we know we people but we soaring like an eagle and you ain't equal straight deceitful I'm hungry so I'll eat you fucking treat me like a tit bro milk me you ain't getting a seat tho this rap orphan getting  deported to his nonsense boring scene his claiming banging
Like palm Beach fall back on this match tress and watch spring break
I'm sipping on it with my bleach
And steady bumping Drake shit fucksakes
I thought was backwards day reporting in
Before I retorted this verbal distortion grenade with no pin
Blowing this out of proportion Canadians love me like Tim Hortons who hears you except all that call you dear and boo but all you do is
Reporting on the feed tag the crew
For abit of adoration cause shits truly frustrating Christian is  fronting/hating. Shouldn't been called a conversation with Satan but that's why I stay bragging I'm pagan
I'll kick you out the office like reagen fuck you you up with the basics like GI training
Get high and don't lose you brain I'm done it's your turn to aim blame no longer a game can't get lost only spent a few cents on this train
