[Intro skit]

[Chorus: Prodigy]
Trust, you don't want to be my enemy
You want to be a friend of me
You rather be my ally, don't want to go to war with me
Nah roll with me, nah don't get me
Upset, nah I'll pump that shotty till' it's empty
Plus you don't want to get me
To the point where we can't speak because when I let the burner represent me
Some deadly, nah it's ready bye bye, relax and rest your mind

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Major shit, this double dope
Extra exclusive, super hot yo
Be careful, this is priceless
Secret info, for the righteous
Humans on this earth, this global brilliance
Voxonic I be speaking fluent languages
Like, German and French, in Russian I'll be cussin'
Spitting my reality rap and they love it
This is insanely ill, all rich with songs
I got thousands of these, that's millions of bars
I'm a special kind of dude, my crew call me the God
Because my verses so fresh, I go on and on
I never turn off, I'm like a machine
I just keep clicking, spitting like an M16
I got these new rappers trying to make a name off me
I got an infamous career, you got temporary heat

[Chorus x1: Prodigy]

[Verse 2:]
Outstanding, outspoken
From the first bar of my song you could tell I'm not jokin'
This high class top shelf shit
Preserved for freshness, quality hits
You see what I'm saying, Could almost smell it
Nah, that's that kush, that OG we melting
To the volcano ash, and when we blow out the smoke
We look the fog, now moving on from that
I got a pocket full of scratch, because I work hard
It will take years to lock yourself in, it's hard
Now I'm written in stone, and I ain't talking about the grave
This is live from L.A, my next stop is a cage
For a little bit, I got to serve this time
Because in front of the grand jury, some crooked cops lie
When I get back, I ain't even got no words
Imma show you how I get down, show you how I rush

[Chorus x1: Prodigy]
