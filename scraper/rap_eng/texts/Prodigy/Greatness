[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Ain't no mistaken on the position we placin'
We placed with a certain ambition that got'em amped and they wishin'
That these opportunities maybe served like dishes with some persistence
We made these misses into missions with no inter-missions
The vision is met precision precisely u cannot stop that collision
I'll say it nicely like aright G my mic be my weapon of mass destruction
Or mass Construction while your ass on umption whether he's about make
To make an eruption or is he gone stop no he's gone pop and that's word to MJ
He the king of that bring it back but I ain't talking bout that line though
I'm talking bout the time I'm already let for the track na,na,na!gimme that
Lemme show you how I beat the beat now be decease I mean cease thee
Don't let me bring the heat cause you could feel it even in the sea
So stop with ya A's an B's now watch me Double the these syllables
And kill these words like Disyllable Diabolical but enough with all
The dying we gotta live it up like the Mayans Da Prodigy is just tryin'
So this is just ah minor fraction of what I got in my mind and u niggas
Need to get your timing before u step to clock less now watch us just watch us!
Hold up I got this now pick it up pick pocket flow with it an don't stop it
Don't stop it cause if ya drop it you gone remember that ya had it
So just watch me have it Da Prodigy boy Team Infamous and we have this like

[Hook]
Uuuhhh this is greatness an you know it my team show it and we glowin'
Cause we focus like like uuuhhh this is greatness so be patient
Cause our patience is gone make it now watch me take it like like
Uuuhhh this is greatness an you know it my team show it and we glowin
Cause we focus like like uuuhhh this is greatness so be patient
Cause our patience is gone make it now watch me take it like like

[Verse 2]
You have no idea I spit it then I rip it and I gotta give it more
Catch me on the go try to catch a flow while I strike a pose that's right
I'm hitting any poser if they come closer right in the nose then I gotta show
That I'm two of the best cause I'm too good for one of the best now watch me lay
The competition to rest because I'm restless or maybe that's just my big ego
Cause he know I always win but I never really blow now that's what we call dry air
And until I'm air to the throne I'mma just take my time be on my grind young
Gotta homie feeling like 99.1 I'm done

[Hook]
