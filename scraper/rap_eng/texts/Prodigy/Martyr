[Verse 1: Slim The Mobster]
Yeah
It's so hard to look at me face to face
I could taste the fear in your blood
For the love of my squad for the love of the thugga
Ball 'til I foul out
Retaliation and revenge, yeah thatâ€™s what I'm about
We could trade war stories we could go to war for it
Just bought automatics and bricks of C-4 for it
Bodies in the storage pussy niggas get extorted
.44 Desert Eagle got about five bodies on it
Makin' my get away [?]
Keep that thing on my waist nigga
Now tell how do you want it
I stay tauntin' the pigs I stay clutchin' my shit
And I'm talkin' like a pimp cause it's nothing you did, I did it
Bigger than most niggas could ever figure me
Disrespect my Crip and they take on [?] get him
Back against the wall, nigga I fight harder
I take 'em all with me I'm a martyr

[Chorus: Slim The Mobster, (Prodigy)]
I-I blew myself up
I-I'm on some Martyr shit
Now who you got a problem with
I blew myself up
I-I'm on some Martyr shit
Now who you got a problem with
I blew myself up
I-I'm on some Martyr shit
(You better kill me)
Now who you got a problem with
(I still don't die)
I blew myself up
I-I'm on some Martyr shit
(Forever)
Now who you got a problem with
(Yeah)

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
I was born for glory
My life a war story
Rebellious child, grew up among the gory
Haunting images of what niggas did
Blood splash on the tree and my Timberlands
All I know is violence, respect it or you check it
Dunn, I'm off without a thought, that's how you send a message
Roll up, Light it up, smoke 'em like a [?]
You know the time, try me, it'll be your darkest hour
Show 'em the meaning of power
Prodigy is criminal minded, brilliance, genius
Run all opposition through the fuckin' cleaners
Get washed, I'm Mobb, I'm a terror
A martyr, civilian nigga, I'm a high-ranked spitter
With the rap or the strap
I'm a whale yous a [?]
Drink away my demons  that receive the sin
Infamous allegiance the Chief of my Indians

[Chorus: Slim The Mobster]
I blew myself up
I-I'm on some Martyr shit
Now who you got a problem with
I blew myself up
I-I'm on some Martyr shit
Now who you got a problem with
I blew myself up
I-I'm on some Martyr shit
Now who you got a problem with
I blew myself up
I-I'm on some Martyr shit
Now who you got a problem with
Now who you got a problem with
