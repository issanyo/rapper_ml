[Intro]
Show some love to some legends in the game you know what I'm saying
???


[Hook]
When you up everybody wanna be down
They all wanna be down
They all wanna be down
Everybody wanna be down when you up
Down when you up
Down when you up
(x2)

[Verse 1]

I used to be that nigga, everybody love me
Girls wanna kiss and hug me, it was lovely
All the fellows wanted to be just like P
Only to hang out and party with dunn from Mobb Deep
My pockets was full and I bought everybody drinks
I'm not selfish I bought everybody things
Bottles and bags to smoke a lot of bull
We got it poppin
I got the Hotel rooms
Everybody wanted to get their hand tattoed
Same spot where I got my hand tattoed
Wanted to be down with the team
And most of these people didn't even know me
My concerts packed, my albums platinum and gold
My messages was full on my cellphone
You couldn't tell me nothing I was fronting on my throne
With my crown, ?? how it never come down

[hook repeats]


[Verse 2]

Just as soon as my money ran out, and the fame start to fizzle out
Nobody around now, they see the raincloud
First it start drizzlin they it start pourin
I turned around and found myself by myself soakin wet like a street dog
??? what happened to the people I looked out for, they played me
Girls used to stalk me now they just ignore me, they want the new popular
