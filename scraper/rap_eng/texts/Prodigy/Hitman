[Verse 1]
I get paid to do what I do and say what I say
Assassinate you quick it's easy for me
To dead you, I'm special
Like the 38 with black electrical tape, my handle
Banana clip P 'cause I spit rap and fire you hear claps and screams
From out the crowd I kill em on stage
In front all these people and fuck the police
I'm fresh out the cage my heart full of rage
My head full of waves I could body more lames
Moment of silence this violence
They rockin all black then mourning 'cause I just
Murder for sport its fun to me
I do this for a living you a victim G
I turn where you stand to a homicide scene
I'm a hitman this is how I eat

[Hook]
Killer, radio killer, contract killer, studio killer
Nigga 'cause I make hits call me hitman bitch
I get paid for murder, number one with a bullet
All that bullshit is that dead, you best keep it moving
Nigga 'cause I make hits call me hit man bitch
I get paid for murder

[Verse 2]
Art of war call me Basquiat
Call me Warhol paint to town red when I spit it
Hit man for hire, for the right price I'll light up your life with this fire
I don't go pop my shit bang
I hit you with this 16 you get slayed
The professional, I clean up the mess that the clean up man left I'm telling you
May God help you, you in my scope
When killing this bitch body in this flows
You get finish like the checkerboard flag
I do it to you niggas
Don't play with me man
Get yourself ruined, we're not the same pedigree
Nothing like me and I'meverything
You wish you was, I wish you luck
I wish you would, I hit you up
Now die now

[Hook]

{Verse 3]
It don't stop till the casket drop
Get your shit pushed back by the shit-push-backer
Platinum and gold plaquer
You don't make hits you drop bricks
You just a battle rapper
A wannabe celebrity, you think you so hot but you're not like me
Separate the elite from the weak
Yous a certified scrub I'm a certified beast

And after all the smoke is done
We'll see who makes hits and who got hit up
Your woman in my line of fire
I'ma body her body, now I mean I get paid for murder

[Hook]
