[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
It's how we tell 'em man
I be like, listen...

[Verse 1]
I'm not interested in all that
No thank you, I pass
Please skip me for the next person
I do appreciate that
So kind of you to offer
But no, really, I'm cool
I try to stay away from the things
That everybody else do
I've got my own thing happenin'
It's workin' out great for me
I'm healthy, I'm happy
I'm successful, and good money, uh
I hope that works out for you
Don't let my good heart fool you, I'll spaz out on you
I'm growin' up, this is dope
You should see this, get a seat
Yeah front row of the P show
Where you can all watch me
If y'all niggas only knew
How dumb y'all niggas look
How stupid y'all niggas sound
It's embarrassing, no good
How could you be so foolish?
This P, nigga, it's P
Yeah that says a lot about you
For you to ever doubt me
You a bird, you comical
But I keep that to myself
Try not to be disrespectful
But you pushin' me to get ill

[Hook]
If you knew better, you would do better
Get it together or lose forever
Your things don't impress me
Give a fuck about that whatever
You're not sayin' nothin' new, nigga
I said that already
Niggas plagiarizin' my rap
As if they trend settin', please

[Verse 2]
I had to learn to keep my opinions under my hat
These rappers are trash, but ain't nothin' we can do about that
Just let their garbage ass live, God loves them too
Ain't that what they say? The Lord protect babies and fools
But when a fool try to play me
Wet him up, then I'm Shwayze
Can't ever be this outstanding
Bitch, my song is amazing
Your shit sound like every other song that's playin' on the station
And your outfit looks silly
And your jewelry is all basic
Slumdog Millionaire watch
Yeah with all that fake shit
Only thing you can pull is a stripper or a waitress
With that credit card fraud bullshit
Try to talk down on me
Your favorite rapper a fraud
But I'ma just sip this tea
With a little E&J spike

[Hook]
Get it together or lose forever
Your things don't impress me
Give a fuck about that whatever
You're not sayin' nothin' new, nigga
I said that already
Niggas plagiarizin' my rap
As if they trend settin'
If you knew better, you would do better
Get it together or lose forever
Your things don't impress me
Give a fuck about that whatever
You're not sayin' nothin' new, nigga
I said that already
Niggas plagiarizin' my rap
As if they trend settin', please
