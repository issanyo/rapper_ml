[Tray Deee]
Infamous Mobb Deep

[Verse 1 - Prodigy]
Out the muthafuckin' depths of New York, it's P
You couldn't get close enough to even touch the kid
If you did, you wouldn't get far enough to bag
I put my guns to work on your bitch ass
Hold up, niggas fuckin' up the game
Put my name in statements, cooperating with these and talkin'
Fuck it, I'll still buck em and gamble with my freedom
These niggas gonna learn to respect the P-Dub
I don't take no shit off of nobody
No nigga, no bitch, lets get rich and party
Let's not test my gangsta, that's how you get bodied
That's how hearts get took, pride get damaged
Lives is shedded, fuckin' wit these east side niggas
We teach y'all niggas 'bout this murder shit
We got Trey Deee, Goldie Loc, Hav and P
Kokane and my nigga Snoop D-O double G

[Verse 2: Tray Deee]
Big hitters, wig splitters, give niggas the blues
Fools loud mouth we all about spittin' them tools
From the coast of the locs were the Gs was born
And we raise up B.G.s to keep it goin'
In the alleys, not the valleys, killa Cali the zone
Long Beach bringin' heat takin' off when it's on
Killa daventry bringin heat takin off when its on
Fuck pretty, come gritty when we bring the noise
Big boys play for keeps when we bring the toys
Wet T-shirts, we search to put in work, cuz
Come back for ya homies as you gettin ya dirt dug
Congregating, operating Gs and hustlers
You other muthafuckers can't conceive our structure
The DPGC, the M-O-B-B strictly eastside and we ride on GP
Bandanas, hoodies, timbos and chucks
Stay mashing on busters not giving a fuck

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Eastsidaz and Mobb Deep
We connected
From the West to the East
Connected
Oh what you got beef?
Connected
Run up on ya while you sleep
Stay connected
My nephews play for keeps
We connected
From the West to the East
Connected
Blast your ass in the streets
We connected
Eastsidaz and Mobb Deep
Stay connected
For life

[Kokane] Yeah (repeat 30X)

[Verse 3: Havoc]
Connect with my dogs be that serious shit
Serious things when MOB and 'sidaz bang
Ice and chains, be best that you hide those thangs
And pressure to that ass we apply those thangs
Told you fucks before, when it rains it pours
Its a cold cold world nigga its Doggy Dogg
Better walk or crawl(for real), cause on the real homeboy
Fuck around and you'll be up in the morgue
Moms praising the lord, rev painting the picture
Of a wise young man who didn't get the picture
We keep it gangsta nigga don't get it twisted nigga
Cross me nigga, you'll wind up a missing nigga
QB and we truly rep for ours
Wars and scars, bitches in a gang of whips
When it came to this game though we changed the shit
And fuck who you with, it's what you up in the club but yo

[Verse 4: Goldie Loc]
Uzis, AKs, Glock 40s and Tech 9s
Tryna take mines, you'll be a dead motherfucker
Come up short, with your life on support
Burning rubber down the street in a black super spoke
Fo' pokes to the neck, five sticks to the dome
Gun powder on my clothes when I smacked him in his nose
Real talk, show you how to walk the walk
All black all times when I scheme and stalk
It's something about being a cold blooded killer
I'm bananas my nigga, like a black ass gorilla
I'm G'd up, smoking all the motherfucking weed up
Drinking on a full cup nigga

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, defintely connected
How you love that?
Uh, like I said you can't spell the West with out the ES
East side up Eastsidaz
From QB to the LB
You see what I see and G how I G
Feel me?
Eastsidaz, duces and trayz the old fashioned way
Alchemist
Uh, yeah-yay
