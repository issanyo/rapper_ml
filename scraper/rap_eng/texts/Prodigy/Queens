[Intro]
I never had a problem where I be
Never had to hit em where I sleep
Old timers told me never shit where I eat
Yeah heard that, nigga out here on the street

[Verse 1: Boogz Boogetz]
Check, ugh
Top down in the coupe, I let her feel the breeze
Ballin' hard while these niggas is in little league
Sending rappers out to see a bunch of little me's
Meanwhile in Queens they shooting out like it's Middle East
Bad bitches you know they ready to go for me
Down for whatever, they never say no to me
New Hefner, I'm surrounded by snow bunnies
Like a runny nose, shit all I do is just blow money
Tipsy off the tequila, letting off with the heater
Skirting off in the beamer, my niggas is all for the meter
This is the high life respect like I'm Christ
Said I'm so ill, shit I could probably die twice
Life's a gamble, I'm just rolling my dice
Got my younging's under the wing, like fried rice
I stay trippy I like the lime
Getting licked in this infamous life of mine

[Hook]
This infamous life of mine, while I roll Queens I've seen some things make me wonder why
This infamous life of mine, in the life of crime, with the streets get crazy get your paper, don't stop your grind
This infamous life of mine

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Nocturnal vampire like I'm uptown
Queens in the building getting money shut it down
Thwag told me get em, nigga so I shot em
1 for the team, take it, no problem
Boogz told me to come to the lab we got more
Music set their ass down like a clothes store
That shit ain't bleak, nigga you ain't about that
Put that lighter in the air, where that loud pack
Where that liquor that you talking about, in your rack
Where that [?] j's in your instagram
Sorry if I come across like I'm bitter but I hate a dumb nigga, acting like he that nigga (cut it out)
Born infamous, bitches jumping like they bunnies
Tell that nigga Hef he owe Hefa some money
New York, New York nigga come and check us out
Times Square to the p's, know what I'm about

[Hook]
This infamous life of mine, while I roll Queens I've seen some things make me wonder why
This infamous life of mine, in the life of crime, with the streets get crazy get your paper, don't stop your grind
This infamous life of mine
