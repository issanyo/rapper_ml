(The Sword Beach)
(Mobb Deep)

[Chorus: Dirty J]
Put me in the ground, man
Vacation Forever
Having too much fun
I ain't coming back, never
Gin to the sky
Put the knife to the leather
Put me in the ground, man
Vacation forever
I'm in the ground, man
Vacation Forever
Having too much fun
I ain't coming back, never
Gin to the sky
Put the knife to the leather
Put me in the ground, man
Vacation Forever

[Verse 1: Dirty J]
1, 2 shots to the motherfuckin' Bumble Clock
Wanna get some go then you gotta fuckin' blow some snot
Wish we got
Do some pot
Leave me in an empty lot
Bound to get you wishing to stop
You better die
Wish me not
Gods change
People don't
Look we fuckin' did the row
Look we fuckin' did our home
Look we fuckin' did our own
3 Men come and one will be the fuckin' first to go
Beat me up but can we please just get the anal probe
Tell by my entrails
All my like a spin sail
I'm a walking skeleton
I float along like chemtrails
You're the hammer
I'm the nail
Fuck a vegan
And their kale
I'm a beast
I need some meat
Feed it to the garbage pale
Kids flipping lids
Giving shits
Doing hits
If you see the reaper, ask him if I'm on that list of his
Sick and tired of fuckin' sneaking around with all of his mistresses
See me talkin' to his bitch call it minding your own business

[Chorus: Dirty J]
In the ground, man
Vacation Forever
Having too much fun
I ain't coming back, never
Gin to the sky
Put the knife to the leather
Put me in the ground, man
Vacation forever
I'm in the ground, man
Vacation Forever
Having too much fun
I ain't coming back, never
Gin to the sky
Put the knife to the leather
Put me in the ground, man
Vacation Forever

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Ya, I put it in the ground
That's a vacation forever
For that shit that you pulled
You ain't coming back, never
I be in the Caribbean
Shorts with my tims on
Smoking on a branch
Listening to my songs
New York City dawn
I rap for the project
Each and able but queens wild arrests
Daddy push me outta the nest
Like fly or you hit the dirt
I wasn't here before ta
My crown didn't fit
But look how I drew into it
While the ops followed the bins
I've been with you
Well that hot boy shit
Already been through it
But my gun still works
Yeah, that still went through it
Vise drip
Seared lips
You're talking to me crickedly
This fire in my eyes
You're nervous to look at me
The cops better not
Cause I ain't doing 25
With the elbow
I exit through the gift shop

[Chorus: Dirty J]
In the ground, man
Vacation Forever
Having too much fun
I ain't coming back, never
Gin to the sky
Put the knife to the leather
Put me in the ground, man
Vacation forever
I'm in the ground, man
Vacation Forever
Having too much fun
I ain't coming back, never
Gin to the sky
Put the knife to the leather
Put me in the ground, man
Vacation Forever

Verse 3: Know-Madik]
Know-Madik
Just left the ER and I'm already ill again
Coming straight out of coffin Exhausted and diligent
Easy, smiling while I deal with it Always resilient
True, far from an idiot fools calling me brilliant
Reeling in fans real ecstatic they're digging it
Revealing plans ready to evaporate ignorance
I put two cents over green greed isn't my predicament
But it doesn't mean I won't scream and act belligerent
Gentleman running through each bone and ligament
Mixed kids skin reminiscent of cinnamon
No I'm no Sit and Spin citizen
All men are sinners didn't claim to be innocent
Dangerous so imminent, Plot so intricate
High off life it's my obvious stimulant
No mathematics can find my equivalent
What can I say? vacation is infinite
Death-cheating, cheesing
Lead the life that I believe in
Close my eyes and I be leaving
Middle finger to my demons
On the mic yo I'm the meanest
If not must have missed the meeting
This is Heaven on Earth feeling like I'm dead and dreaming

[Chorus: Dirty J]
In the ground, man
Vacation Forever
Having too much fun
I ain't coming back, never
Gin to the sky
Put the knife to the leather
Put me in the ground, man
Vacation forever
I'm in the ground, man
Vacation Forever
Having too much fun
I ain't coming back, never
Gin to the sky
Put the knife to the leather
Put me in the ground, man
Vacation Forever

Verse 4: Dirty J]
Can't enjoy
Caviar
If you haven't eaten dirt first
Only eating diamonds and you don't know what the worst's worth
Child to a man and from birth to the church, Hearse
Give all I can from the last to the first verse
Hundreds of news, I play through hundreds of booze
For me to fuckin' stop and take a hundred of you's
We've got hundreds of fools
Darling, don't cry it's cool
Robbing graves and clearing tombs like I was running the jewels
Raids like peg on the souls and some faded
Go to hell for the hell of it
Tell the devil I made it
He said "the world is your oyster"
I said "I cracked it and ate it"
He said "come back anytime let's do some lunch I'll be waiting"
Migratable, aidable warm food on the table
Put this shit out worldwide to and without a label
Through a battle a waddle
Take a knot and a narrow
Going out with the belt like I was Eddie Guerrero

[Chorus: Dirty J]
In the ground, man
Vacation Forever
Having too much fun
I ain't coming back, never
Gin to the sky
Put the knife to the leather
Put me in the ground, man
Vacation forever
I'm in the ground, man
Vacation Forever
Having too much fun
I ain't coming back, never
Gin to the sky
Put the knife to the leather
Put me in the ground, man
Vacation Forever
