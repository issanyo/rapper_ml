Blood in my Gatorade, I was raised different
I said blood in my Gatorade, I was raised different
I said blood in my Gatorade, I was raised different
I said blood in my Gatorade, I was raised different
I was raised, I was raised different
I said blood in my Gatorade, I was raised different
I was raised, I was raised different

[Metta World Peace]
I was raising that south, too, way the sharks do
When we came up in the hood only shit that came around
I’m like a shoe sting, most never seen that
Get up my way, I see a brain frozen in that ground
Came up, was raised up, buy the dogs, they was 5% Haitian
You a reporter, they hate us, I love every block that I came from
Mom and dad came from, they told me stay tough
Always move forward, never back up
Stay hustling, blood in my water cup
Blood in my Gatorade, yeah, drink it up
We adapt to survive, clap at it, call it eye for an eye
This is a very strange life, people wanna know why I act like that

[Prodigy]
This blood is in my Gatorade, blood sport
When I play is not a game, I’m not afraid
If niggas feel some kind of way
Pockets broke, I can’t pay, the new paint, they in the crowd
I’m playing in the game, you pay to get it now
It’s blood coming out the speakers, beef is fun, nose bleeders
Can’t afford the good seats, why you mad at me for?
…like a reefer, gets you turned like a jump season
Take a number, wait in line, for my head
I don’t taste sappy drama, I just booby trap clowns
I just walk a straight line, cross my path, it’s man down
We born to score it, y’all niggas is boring
You never made a hot zone, never did a touring
Ten pack stadium, we selling amnesia
Cool pack and titty bar, nobody care to see your corny ass song
You ain’t hard like Lamar, you ain’t bad, you ain’t here
You ain’t a warrior like me

[Hunna]
I was raised to go in, there’s blood in my Gatorade
Killing all these dreams and all I do is bring heat in
Spitting that crazy fire, just causing that competition
Rule for nothing, that make you green like a villain
Me, I’m no different, still hustling hard
Doing missions, catch me in the booth like I’m cooking in the kitchen
…in the mind, never tripping, slipping ‘cause all I do is keep winning

[Rain Bisou]
Another oath for my concrete jungle
It wasn’t always just cops cutting, jump throat
Southern California wasn’t nice to me
But it taught me right and that was life to me
‘Cause I was raised different
Said I’ll never make it but I never listen
‘Cause I was raised different
Said I’ll never make it but I never listen
