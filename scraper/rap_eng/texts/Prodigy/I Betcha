[Intro: Prodigy + (The Alchemist)]
Hit that shit, man
(QB…Kokizzle)
This is an exclusive
Spit that shit, my nigga

[Kokane]
Now there one’s thing that you can’t deny
Everything you say is a lie, yeah
Braggin’ ‘bout what you ain’t got really makes me mad
But you can’t give what you never had, alright
Well, bless this game, you could fool a few
I know the truth but it’s up to you

[Chorus: Kokane]
You can’t hide, and I betcha
Ooh, betcha
You can’t hide, and I betcha
Ooh, and I betcha

[Prodigy]
Dawg, you fuckin’ with some serious gangsta shit
Talkin’ like you walkin’ how you talkin’, you’s a bitch
I’m a full-fledged Mobb nigga, so what’s next?
Guns go off, muh’fuckas hit decks
The niggas I hit just bleed to death
‘Cause I ain’t got time to worry ‘bout revenge
And I ain’t worried ‘bout a nigga getback
I’ma sit back and live my life and handle that
Like the young soldier I be, El Capitano P
The Black Gestapo, get at niggas something awful
Buckwheat niggas, fuck these niggas
I peel off in a triple-Black Medina
With they honeys on my passenger side
Gettin’ at they ear, get ‘em drunk and high
Get shorty to switch sides
Now I got your ID, you smell me? Tell me…

[Chorus: Kokane]
You can’t hide, and I betcha
Ooh, betcha
You can’t hide, and I betcha
Ooh, and I betcha
