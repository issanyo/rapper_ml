[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Pay attention to them demons praying for your
Downfall
When it rains it pours but I maneuver like a computer through the rainfall
I seen it all, glass dick addicts, get high as attics
Ds dressed as fiends, wolves in sheep clothes tactics
It's graphic, like your favorite horror movie
KKK is back from the past except they cops on duty
Pretty girls who deserve the world can't see they beauty
Ass shots, cause her man said he likes a big booty
Listen baby girl, better know your worth
You deserve to be spoiled not treated like soil, dirt
Even though you're a flower, a rose with potential
Haters gon be judgemental, don't let it mess up your mental
When he spit from his dental, make sure you look in his iris
Trust is a must and distrust is a virus
Don't give him any part of your heart cause baby that's priceless
Pay attention, be smart don't let your heart perceive blindness

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Mindless zombies with mentalities of fiends I served in lobbies
No different from Barbies everybody's a copy
Pay attention, you moving too sloppy
Pillowtalking to these birds that be squaking and you ended like Bonnie
And Clyde, I glide, on this musical ride of where the beat  takes Me
God built me a wall of china you vaginas couldn't break me
Save me, from my environment
I hope this weed gives me enlightenment
When I take a hit hope I write another hit
I slipped into a subconscious abyss , damn, that's some deep shit
A coma of higher thinking
And I just keep sinking
Into my thoughts
And realizing I wasn't ready for this world and what was I taught
In school to get me through my tribulations
Corrupt intentions and manipulations
Of a black man; drugz, Money, bitches and clothes
I'm under attaxk man, I'm a thug, it ain't funny, fuck these snitches and hoes

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Pay attention to women with evil intention
Don't judge of first impressions ain't no girl pretty enough for me to get an infection
Because of an erection I let make a decision
Satans a liar tryna make me turn my back on religion
Dear god, keep me safe from the snakes that try to bite
And inject the venom of hate in blood to block my sight
From the road of goals and down the road
Where hoes are potholes and homies will do you dirty for pots of gold
Mugz be cold when your heart is stone it won't break
Believe I know loving these hoes , your soul they might take
