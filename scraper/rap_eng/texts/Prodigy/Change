[Verse 1]
There are two kinds of people in this world
Those who make things happen and those who just watch and copy off of us
I get my rush makin brush styles
They simulate me but imitation is the highest form of flattery
So gas me kid wit your blandishment
It only makes me realize how much you really on my dick
Suckin all the flavor off of my love like you's a bitch
Save something for my chick but go ahead get yo licks
I've been doing this since Makavelli made hits
Biggie Smalls said, "and Mobb Deep started dun language"
40 inch chains and Hennessy
Shootin videos in them projects in Queens

[Hook]
Nothing stays the same, hip-hop goes through eras my man
The only thing constant is change
Now ask yourself, are you a follower or a leader?
Leaders create and followers just follow the leaders

[Verse 2]
We used to rock certified suits and Timbaland boots
Avirex leather jackets with the bandana hoop
Snatch the chain off yo neck, the definition of swag
Who else but Brooklyn and Queens where all my thugs at?
Out in California also
Those where the days when pussy niggas couldn't rap
They was too afraid to get up on the stage and rock for the hood
Cause the hood was the only crowd there was
Some niggas are stuck in that time zone
They can't adapt or get none of this neo dough
Hope you saved up while you was high and had your run
Cause the clock ran out and your 15 is done

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I see a bunch of nonsense in the game right now
It's a whole gang of garbage and copycat styles
Step yo game up, step yo brain up, go get a dame
She deserved to live that life of the rich and famous
Not the life of the dummy lame fucks
That ass deserve expensive seats and dressed up in the finest threads, that designer shit
Diamonds are strictly for women, yea that's the new trend
Stop acting like a bitch and take the crystals off
And get that glass off yo wrists and stop makin rap songs
You's a certified thrown ball, straight ass

[Hook]
