[Prodigy]
Aiyo, peace to our way of life, hats off to all the trife
Let's toast the fully autos and foot long knives
Especially for stacks of green backs
My outfit'll perform, some blow off steam raps
Now let me take y'all niggas, back to my basics of this
You're anxious to flip, fag, catch a face lift
My shank do remarkable things for fakeness
My whole mob got the same patience
Throw on your track Asics, and make moves like a spaceship
We pack places, Infamous bangs your nation
You're light at the weight station, that weak shit need replacin'
Put this in heavy rotation
Overdose music, it's theraputic to the user
Drive a while, under the influence of this
Careful cause you might just crash your shit
Total your whip, and still pull my tape out your deck
Me and Montana connect, like thirty thousand dollar links
Unprofitable, unstopable, top of you

[Cormega]
My drug clientele was bringin' me money well
Smokin' buddha l's, and weed so good, they leave a funny smell
Niggas scopin' me, hopin' police is close to me
Mega regulatin', the way shit supposed to be
Gold chain chokin' me, cocaine provokin' me
To live my destiny, jacuzzi waters soakin' me
Floatin in a smokin Durango, doin' my thing yo
My mack milli', sweeter than a mango
Son, you know the drilly, the drama is a part of me
Did time for cocaine, knives, and armed robbery
My rhyme rig graffiti, is a live nigga prophecy
Mega poetic, rhymes are like dimes, but no credit
I'll leave your mind paralyzed, dunn, but don't wet it
Scarface persona, I acquired a taste for drama
And I embrace this, spray shit, you banned from the projects
You're love here... yo, I'ma see you
Nigga you transparent, see through rhymes, fully automated
You semi-crime related, Cormega and Mobb Deep rhyme amazin'
Thug shit you can't fuck with, what

[Havoc]
Fuck your bullshit rep, nigga you ass bet
Talkin' all that shit, don't even got cash yet
Our flaws, try to get away, no gats tossed
Got drama with my click, I'mma take it to the source
QBC representive, I'm just tryin to live
If I can't get to you, I'mma take it to your kids
Spray your crib, fuck it, son, somethin' gotta give
If I can't live, then ain't nothin' gonna live
That's dead ass, 'bout to put this whole shit in the smash
You real, hit that ass up with foam wheels
On dope side, you gonna squeal, like them other rappers
You know we kick the truth, you wanna clap us
I got this, strictly out the mouth, nothin' but hot shit
Pop shit, couldn't fuck with this, when we drop shit
You helpless, put your whole shit outta service
We don't smoke shit, thank God for this
Yo, if it wasn't, for niggas like us, you'd just be asked us
Hustlin' for patty cake cats, come on now, you know I know
When it come to gats, I'm a ho, never bite my tongue
Let them playa haters know, how we comin'
Straight comin' through while you runnin'
Get done in, had that ass shakin' like a bitch when she cummin'
One in a mil', slipped that ass like a mickey
It's 50-50, fuckin' with this nigga, just come and get me
