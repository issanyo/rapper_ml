[Intro]
Welcome, yeah

[Verse 1]
I was born in a concrete garden
Minus the synthetics do your research
My genetics one hundred percent organic
The earth and the sun provide me with all that I need
Can't dig up my grass roots they too deep I don't budge
The mainstream comes to me
See a flower don't know it's power it just is
It's just nature for me to flourish and grow big
The Most High made me perfect, my flaws are a thing of beauty
Character, and uniqueness
I love my self if I don't then who will?
I wanna be just like the man in the mirror (huh?)
Cause we can't ask for more
He look good, rap good, he got it going on
Like the Egyptian God the young pharaoh
Build pyramids with money stacks, now yo

[Chorus]
I don't compete, I just create
I spit my peace, I don't debate
It's no argument, no contest
You know what it is and heard what I said
I don't compete, I just create
I spit my peace, I don't debate
It's no argument, no contest
You know what it is and heard what I said

[Verse 2]
I'm the black rose that grew through the crack in the sidewalk
A miracle baby, look at me
I made it through the broken glass, and the dope needles too
And them lil' baggies with the coke residue
You touch me your hands gon' bleed from the Dons
A defense mechanism that was given by God
I'm not out to hurt nobody
It's not in my nature to do such things
I just live my, life until my little time is played
And return to the essence from which I came
Until then, get familiar you would wanna be on my side
Ahead of time or catch a bang wagon ride
Cause, when the shit turn violent
The Infamous mafia shut down the whole environment (get 'em)
Yeah, Infamous Mobb Deep
Go 'head force me to show your dumb ass your shit stink, pussy

[Chorus]
I don't compete, I just create
I spit my peace, I don't debate
It's no argument, no contest
You know what it is and heard what I said
I don't compete, I just create
I spit my peace, I don't debate
It's no argument, no contest
You know what it is and heard what I said
