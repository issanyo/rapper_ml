[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
You got that body body
Right now I’m going at you
Later I’m tryna splack you
Keep your heels on, keep them heels on
Take them clothes off but keep your heels on
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Girl, I wanna make you cry
I wanna make you scream
I wanna make you sweat
Make you wet when you dream
Pick you up at lunch so we could do the backseat
Can’t concentrate at work, you thinkin’ ‘bout P
Killin’ it, tip drillin’ it, I’m spillin’ it
All over the place, that milk, got her feelin’ it
Your man never made your body shake like that
Bet he don’t know his girl make her face like that
Offa long dick, hock spit in her ass crack
While I long dickeded it, yeah, from the back, uh
Honey’s sophisticated, mommy raised her like a lady
Bet every woman got a freak inside ‘em going crazy
Only way to pop it off, you hit ‘em with the proper talk
They put they guard down and give a nigga what we want
Roll a blunt, pour a drink, nigga, get the buzz going
Keep ‘em talking, don’t let ‘em think for a moment
Turn the music up, lights down, we gon’ fuck right now
Start sucking they tits, and push they head right down
Sloppy face diva catch a breather ‘cause her jaw hurt
Then you lay ‘em back with their legs on your shoulders
And dig deep, get up in they stomach how they want it
It ain’t no fallin’ short, naw nigga, keep it comin’, ay

[Hook]
Say say baby baby, you got that body body
You got that face that make me wanna kick it like karate
Right now I’m going at you
Later I’m tryna splack you
And while we pop it off, you can keep your heels on
Keep your heels on, keep your heels on
Take them clothes off but keep the heels on
Keep your heels on, keep them heels on

(Alchemist: Ayo P, tell ‘em how we like the fatties)

[Verse 2]
Poking out the waist in Jimmy Choo’s
Charles David boots, bumps with the pumps
We like the girls with the ass you could lean on
Fatty you could sleep on, her shit is like a pillow
Nice feet, toes curl when you hit her
Dig her nails in my back, talkin’ ‘bout I’m tryna kill her
Grab the sheets like she being raped, but she want it nigga
Let’s have phone sex, yeah, I talk dirty
So when you see me in the flesh we can skip the flirtin’
And get right to squirtin’, make our own pornography
And let the tape leak on the street, that’s real nasty
Fuckin’ like jungle bunnies, show you ‘bout that black sweat
That boy Prince, P got that king dick
Representing Queens, she was raised in Brooklyn
I got her crossing over that bridge, she lookin’ lookin’
For one more taste, we get it bungie jumping
I got the bungie cords, Magnums, extra large

[Hook]
Say say baby baby, you got that body body
You got that face that make me wanna kick it like karate
Right now I’m going at you
Later I’m tryna splack you
And while we pop it off, you can keep your heels on
Keep your heels on, keep your heels on
Take them clothes off but keep the heels on
Keep your heels on, keep them heels on
I wanna see you naked with them high heels on

Some of the tenants claim to have heard noises coming from this room
Like someone on a rampage
