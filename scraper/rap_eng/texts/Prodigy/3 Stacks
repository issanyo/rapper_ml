Yeah yeah yeah
Old school Pt.2 feel it
The realest, who be the realest?
That's how we do it, man!
We run through it, nigga

I'm the number one insane rapper mix CD stabba'
Your album was doo-doo, I threw it out the passenger
The number one crapta, the 8, the 12, the 16, 22's and 23's
Sometimes I could blow a little steam
I got alot on my chest but I keep it quiet, so I don't blow the steam
Get 'em everytime, my millitary bars, will leave a permanent mark on ya brain
The comeback kid, to see you get your ass whooped!
Mad witnesses, these niggas mad shook!
I don't have a clue, why he chose to speak on my name, when you know I'm gon' shoot
You know I'm gon' crack yo' face, when you see me in the place I'm a dangerous person
Behind the rope, poppin' off with the girl
You got the ratchet in the car
I got the ratchet on my person!

3 Stacks, 3 Stacks, 3 Stacks
And a pocket full of hats!

It don't stop, it don't stop, it don't stop
When it's on it go pop!

Yo, it been a long time since I sold a dime on a dime
This shit too hot whoa!
Its poppin' uptown when I used to see Flaco
Now back to the block hollerin' 'I got those'
I got those in every state, like the same amount of snitches that you got in your face
I'mma make my cracks bigger and take over the whole hood
Shit changed, dunn the ladies say that I'm no good
I smoke wood, to get high till we pass out
Cash over bitches, that's how we ride out
I''a G, rep QBC, with a fully on my back, kid. Who want beef?
Loose teeth over bullshit, you want that?
I'mma crazy motherfucker' beat you down with a bat
It's 'Big Twin' if you don't know, you betta' recognize!
I'm not the one to fuck with, I'm down to catch a homicide, YEAH!

Ferrari Testarossa, I start the motor
Go from New York to South Dakota
When I was a kid I drank beer, not Soda!
Never hit the girls if they panties had the odor
You put my songs for sale and I'm a good earner
And I shot ya man, so I could test my burner
My 223's spit, flyin' down the VanWyck
When I'm in Queens, I make sure I see my man Twin
When I'm in Brooklyn, I holla at G
Love to see the girls ass-naked in the Tee
Take her to the crib, turn on the flat-screen
My couch is Gucci, sit ya ass next to me
