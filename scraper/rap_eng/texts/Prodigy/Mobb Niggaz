"We be the Infamous" - Prodigy (repeated throughout intro)

[Intro: Prodigy]
You know, ever since I could remember I wanted to be a gangsta
Them real gangstas that is, them Mobb niggas
Them killers that moved in silence, them round table niggas
But when I think back, them gangstas around my way
There was this one nigga that went by the name of...

[Godfather Pt. III]
The God motherfuckers get scarred with no bars
Hold animal niggas that go to war with a vengeance
All you gotta do is mention the click, and that's that
Reconstruct your whole thought, with bloodsport force
All y'all off course niggas get shook back in place
I pop heavy, we Rock Steady, shots to your face
From a place where I was thought always hold mine, so I'mma hold this
We the Infamous, continous hits
Of nothin but that raw street, ghetto shit
Pah, we kill dogs to the death, lay niggas to rest
Drink Henny cold best, fuck bein the best
I peel through chest, 'till I see your flesh
Eat your heart, and spit it out, I could give a fuck less
Get stuck up in some shit, that you know you gon' regret
Motherfucker!

"We be the Infamous" - Prodigy (repeats throughout interlude)

[Interlude: Prodigy]
This some crazy shit
Yeah that's right, you know
We talkin that real criminal shit
YouknowwhatI'msayin?
Niggas like that is hard to come by
They don't make niggas like that everyday man
And now that I'm thinkin, I can remember this other nigga
Aiyyo, this is a gangsta, this is a real gangsta nigga right here

[Prodigy]
Bandana P, Banana Clip P
E'rybody move back, it's 'bout to get ugly
They try and shit on me like I ain't a made nigga
I ain't gotta send soldiers, I hit niggas
Bang your head off, big respect like the name Xerox
Run bitch, I'm airin out your blid-ock
Niggas get shot fuckin with me, of course
You a rap nigga, I'm a crime boss
I'm a full bread, full-fledged Mobb nigga
I Pledge alliegance to my Infamous flag, niggas get tagged
And bagged, for comin at my familia
This ain't the Roc nigga, we ain't them faggot ass niggas
It's just that gangsta shit, from the world's most dangerous click
That walk any pavement, I do what the fuck I feel
Say what the fuck I want
These niggas be bitin' they tongue

"We be the Infamous" - Prodigy (repeat to fade)

[Outro: Prodigy]
Yeah, ok, uh-huh, ok

Uh-huh, Banana Clip P, H-a-v-o-c Havoc
Ty Nitty, one time, Ty Nitty
It's that Mobb shit, Ron Gotti
You know? Bars N Hooks Bars N Hooks
Littles, Cormega, it don't get more gangsta than that, boy
Rapper Noyd, y'all niggas ain't ready
B12, you heard? KnowI'msayin dunn?
I could teach you about this shit right here, man
KnowI'msayin? We got history, man
We go back, man, this ain't no game, nigga
Oh hell no, I'm sayin, this shit just throw together, man
We put out the world, hell no, we blood, sweat and tears
This shit's the real
