(Young P)
Ayo daddy show these mothafucka's how we do it

P, P, P, P
P, P, P, P
Who holding down NYC huh?
P, P, P, P
Yeah, listen

[Prodigy]
It don't matter who popping for the moment
P is forever, it don't matter what's the new hot shit
My shit better, courtesy of myself, thanks to me
I've work hard to come with these
Sixteen's is much more than a rap, this is pure facts
You see what's really good when you catch him by himself
Dolly, I leave a fool holy like Jesus Christ
It's a miracle he still living
And you could say a whole life time of prayer
But you never in this lifetime player be the mayor of the murder murder
Killer killer, bloody rap songs out the slums in the squala
Made a few dollars, now they say I'm too rich
I give some to you, now a nigga cool
Ha, I ain't got two cents for you bums
Now watch as I burn rubber in the six-huns
CL made my gun ring a bell
Where the shots came from they never can tell
They just here to fire and everybody bails
One nigga on the ground dying in hell
Fo'real!

(Chorus) Prodigy and kids
A B C D E F G
H I J K L M O
P P P P P P P
And numero uno P
There's no other
Kids tell 'em who I be
A B C D E F G
H I J K L M O
P P P P P P P
The one and only
H.N.I.C. who holding NYC huh?

[Prodigy]
Listen, R.I.P season begins
Dead bodies popping up, niggas getting hit
Others getting beat the fuck out and bashed out
MOP style, they get mashed out
I razor blade you up and cut you bad
You gon' need plastic where your face's at
Boy I'll bullet riddle you up and chop you into parts
Then scatter you all over the East Coast, kiko
You're playing with your life
You play with me you're like a baby running with a knife
You're upset your wife got my CD in the changer
And you rap too and she don't bump your bangers
Your shit wack and then on top
Your life style don't match the shit you pop
This is gon' be simple cause you're easy
Like 1 2 3, I do it niggas greasy as...

(Chorus) Prodigy and kids
