[Verse 1]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-hah, I'm laughing with my mobb
While you remained confused by me, the Prodigy
You put your verse I put my verse in
We see who really burnin and spittin flames for certain, you check
My 16 pon fire, the rap Spike Lee
Lot of multi-million dollar rapper dont like we
But they can't do shit cause I'm too consistent
Plus my street power not to be test, no
I put down the mac-11 make me pick it back up
I put down the 2-pound make me double back son
And get my 50-cal, oh you hear me now
See its never no peace till that piece come out
You put Prodigy up with the best I show and prove
I'm not the punchline rapper my style more smooth
No gimmicks no artificial flavor keep it 100 percent with me
You miss me

[Hook]
They say P fell off, his high-horse landed on my two feet planted on solid ground
Mobb Deep fell off, the bottom and we landed on top how we turn the world upside down
P fell off, his bullshit back on his good shit
Yeah that's what I'm talkin about
Mobb Deep fell off, the bottom and we landed on top how we turn the world upside down

[Verse 2]
The top of the dome and spit better poems than that crack that took you eight hours wrote
I'm a natural
I got you, this is what I do
I'm not a battle rapper I create albums
Underrated like Don Cheadle it's don P though
Classical like Sinatra and Hendrix we're endless
Black mafia hits that Mobb Deep shit
Gets deeper than rap music I told you
Them niggas bleed just like us you heard it here first
Rappers, they bite my lyrics and they run with my words
I just take it as a compliment it gives me confidence
It just confirms that I'm the P in this shit
More so than Kanye
My favorite rapper, you got T.I, Jeezy, Weezy, Santana
50, Jay-z and even maybe throw in a little Jada and Style wow

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The most infamous in New York state
I shape and mold rappers like a waffle
I spot you, and help you carry that weight
I give you couple bars on consignment
You owe me you know me
Your grandpappy these rappers my grandsons
Which make me the worlds youngest granddaddy
I sit up on my throne call me king songs
My reign at the top very long, infinite admit it
Got these haters indeed now
Know they was happy I did years in the P now
Thought I would fold up
No such luck for you bum fucks
That's the sound of my dump truck full up
Of my reserve notes for all you turn coats
Left me for dead
I'ma kill you with success
While I resurrect live on stage I'm on tour
While you beef about sound scan and who sell more

[Hook]
