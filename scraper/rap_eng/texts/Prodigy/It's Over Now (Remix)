What is this?
Numbers in your pocket
I remember when you
Used to throw those things away
Why do you wanna keep in touch now?
Who gave you a reason?
To act so shady

Baby you know
You can call me anytime
Anything you needed I would give it to you
Ooh, that's how much I care for you
You wanna act now
Never call me back now
Turning off your cell phone
Girl you know that ain't cool
Yes I don't understand baby

(Prodigy)
Let's do it, come on
Listen, what ever happen to us
The love, the lust
We don't even kiss no more
It's nuttin like before
Now it's more pain than joy
It's makin me sick
Who'd evea think we be goin through this
Sunny dayz, everybody loves dem
But can we get through this lil bit of rainin
Damn, we stay arguin
So I guess this is it, it's so foul
How we can't work this out, it's over now

Chorus:
Baby it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk
Girl we don't even kiss
I never would've thought
We'd be breaking up like this
But it's over now
It's over now

You think that I don't know what's going on
Cause you're always home alone
And I'm always out of town
You need to stop trying to play me
Cause you can't even fade me
I know you're messing around baby

Baby you know
You can call me anytime
Anything you needed I would give it to you
That's how much I care for you baby
You wanna act now
Never call me back now
Turning off your cell phone
Girl you know that ain't cool
Oh I don't understand baby

Repeat Chorus (X2)

Baby it's a shame
A shame that we go through
The things that we go through
When you're in love with me
And I'm in love with you
I think that we should talk about our problems
Instead of running away
Oh baby it's a shame
We couldn't work it out
Forgot what love was all about
And the feelings we had from the start
My heart will always be with you, oh
Girl it's over

Repeat Chorus till end
