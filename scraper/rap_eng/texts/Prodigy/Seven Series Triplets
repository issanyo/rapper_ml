[Intro]

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Uh-huh, yeah, yo
Cash in a brief case, trying to play it smart
Love is a privilege and you better play your part
Don't wanna leave it to the lawyers breath
Snap my fingers, you'll be laying on the foyer steps
Wishing you were a boy again
Late night stand on the roof, smoke a newp
Reminiscing when I had the broken tooth, we were loose
Three different colors on the goose with the boots
Maryland College basketball suits
I drive the 525 made in '95
Shawn Kemps on the pedal, I'm a kamikaze
Right arm hang out the window while I steer left
Near death, slam into a deer's chest
Lights out for a second, but I'm back
Hopped up like a karate master
Still I blast the shottie faster on you bastards, make you backspin
Come out the closet you've been trapped in, that's it
Queens

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Yeah, nigga you know I put the work in
Head shots real precise like a surgeon
I see your heart beating through your shirt, nervous
Nigga shaking in his J's, his legs gave in
Wow, and I ain't even pull the gun off my waist yet
This nigga done got so scared he took a shit
Then I swerved in some low key wheels
And go about my business like it never happened, chill
For reals, pop a couple pills
Cup a drink, come to think about it I feels
Like turning up the rap, ignorant, loud
Like this weed that I smoke, make a thick, yellow cloud
Perpetual payday, my money don't vacay
I'm out seeing the world, my life is so crazy
You could only imagine
But you could never fathom my intelligence, I get at em

[Interlude: Raekwon]
Oh shit, it's real like that, right y'all?
Word up man, pledge allegiance man

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
I Patrick Ewing niggas, long shotties I be 'suing niggas
You gon' pay, face the camera ruin niggas
And my money, I'm collecting and I'm stepping
Might slap the shit out your man and take his weapon
Hungry and angry and I'm savagery, but still
More your majesty, wipe out the cool t-shirt, vacuum it
And I'm gon' keep you rich, so chill
Or you can live with them faggots and stay away from real deal abbots
Death is our game plan, new playing bullets
Come in spray cans, write graffiti all on your vest
Lester, cousin Eve sleeve all greasy
He the best of it, put it right there, you get a check
Slang prostitution, it's prohibition
When we move shit, this is what some niggas suggest
I suggest war, and clout the fake niggas
They could move out, take no chance, you never know, ya'll

[Outro: Raekwon]
For real man, cause we ain't playing no games no more, no more homies
You sit around this, you sit around the best
With gold forks and all that, word up
Y'all niggas that come shine, come through come through come shine, come
You know what it is man, it's automatic
