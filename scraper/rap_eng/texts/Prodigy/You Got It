[Intro]
Yo, yo, Al, hold up, son
Go into the file, son
The Chemistry Files, son, you know’mean?
The secret, top secret files
Pull out some exclusives, son

Let me drop this gangsta shit on ‘em right quick, man

[Verse 1]
Yo, freestyle, New York style for DJ’s and listeners
Y’all got somethin’ to turn up now
This one you gotta bring back and request back
For my people in the Tri-State part of the map
This represents you but the other parts feel the same too
So we gotta spread love to the youth
We pop bub for them, pop Henny for the crew
Shoot a lead slab in you for speaking out the roof
Of your head, that was a bright idea
But when your light bulb got popped, how that feel?
These niggas is freakin’ twerps
They could never match my wit and match my work
Not to mention the paper or the jewels I work with
But that don’t count, we had those when we was kids
Shorty pose with they tits and they puss’ for the film
Few fat bitches upset ‘cause I ain’t wanna drill ‘em
Listen, this is what life sound like
On the streets where I’m from, this what death sound like
We strictly the theme song or the anthem, dunn
You can’t do what we do, this is sacred to us

[Hook]
Bitch ass niggas keep poppin’ shit (What up?)
They give me the screwface and flash weapons
But all that change when I start squeezin’
They like, “A’ight, stop, chill, please, you got it”
The bad girls come dressed to impress
Niggas like me ‘cause they want the best
I start on the dancefloor then get ‘em in the bed
They like, “Don’t stop, nigga, that’s it, you got it”

[Verse 2]
Freestyle, hood style for little block radios, where that work movin’ out
It’s motivational music, ‘cause it motivates you to go harder, get your money to it
This is the street pharmacy industry
You push drugs through the roof, then this represents you
But those that don’t, they feel the same too
So we gotta spread love to the other parts too
We pop bub for them, crack beers for the crew
Crack a nigga skull open with my gun handle
Niggas be veggie meat fuckin’ with me
His family’ll have to pull the plug on him while he sleep
Shouldn’t have been trying to pull a fast one on me
While I was busy trying to pull shorty pussy out her jeans
Niggas wanna be infamous
You can’t do what we do, this is sacred to us

[Hook]
Bitch ass niggas keep poppin’ shit
They give me the screwface and flash weapons
But all that change when I start squeezin’
They like, “A’ight, stop, chill, please, you got it”
The bad girls come dressed to impress
Niggas like me ‘cause they want the best
I start on the dancefloor then get ‘em in the bed
They like, “You make me feel so good”

[Verse 3]
P style is dope now
It took me a minute to get hot but now they know now
Ever since they’ve been biting off me
Now the world see I’m who they wanna be
It’s still love for them long as it’s room for me
Long as I’m rich, they can bite ‘til they teeth bleed
Move back, nigga, this is danger for you
But that bitch you with, she can hang with the crew
She could come right over here and bang with the truth
Yeah, you better keep her in a headlock ‘cause I’m proof
That all girls cheat
You could buy her clothing and diamond rings, she just gon’ rock that with me
While we smoke the weed, then rock to the beat
She wonder why you can’t be more like P
So you try to be infamous but can’t do what we do, this is sacred to us

[Hook]
Bitch ass niggas keep poppin’ shit (What up?)
They give me the screwface and flash weapons
But all that change when I start squeezin’
They like, “A’ight, stop, chill, please, you got it”
The bad girls come dressed to impress
Niggas like me ‘cause they want the best
I start on the dancefloor then get ‘em in the bed
They like, “You make me feel so good”
