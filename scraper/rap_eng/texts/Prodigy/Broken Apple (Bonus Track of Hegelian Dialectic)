[Verse 1]
Money is worthless real power is people
Real strength is in the street where everybody's equal
I'd rather have a hundred thousand strong supporters of the movement
Down for the cause
This life is amazing your life is dull
If you think a big bank make you successful
Just look at all the colors the ecosystem
The plants and the wildlife is built with intelligence
Just listen fuck just look at yourself
You can't fathom your own operating system

[Hook]
Fuck a macbook I take a real book anyday
And fuck your automation give me a human being
I mean fuck just look at ourselves
We the masses of the Earth and nature is real wealth in abundance
Give thanks to all
The fact that you breathing you should be in awe

[Verse 2]
We the bricks at bottom of the governments pyramids
A ponzi scheme, we being con'd my friend
Thats all adorable your so naive
Its just a metaphor you really looking for some puppet strings
Base cadets can't assimilate fact from theory
Common core education direct from satan
You see the inmates in prison just the ones that got caught
Just imagine all the other shit freely going on
I just shake my head I need thc
My computer just crashed and deleted everything I just did

[Hook]
