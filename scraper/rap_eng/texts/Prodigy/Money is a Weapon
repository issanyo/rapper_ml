Yo, Al hold up son, go into the files son
The chemistry file son, you know what I mean? The secret, top secret files, pull out some exclusives son...

This.. is... an exclusive...
V.I.P and all that gangsta shit man...
Run out and go get a whole boxload of them shits, so you can pass it out to everybody in the hood son, you know what I mean? They're gonna thank later
Infamous soldiers, G-Unit motherfucking Guerillas, you heard?

[Verse 1: Prodigy]

Ever since 50 Cent signed Mobb Deep
The dollars started pouring and the niggas wanna creep
First thing I did, was buy a bomb proof truck
Because mad that my comrades was murdered in they trucks
Parked up, smoking blunts, they didn't see it coming
Imma' live for all of my niggas that bit the bullet
Wish they could see me now, with hundreds of thou's
In a safebox, a few of them would try to take me out
Possibly, because paper makes everything change
Especially the mills, popping these pills
Just to calm me down, I'm anxious for the sounds
Of gunfire rounds, I cut a nigga down
Like the rainforests, you be alone in the woods
You a lost sheep, I'm a whole pack of wolves
Straight jaro meat, dunn dunn, you dinn dinn
And I don't go to sleep when that nigga write his shit

[Hook]

Money makes hearts turn cold, friends turn foes
When jewelry get froze, women turn hoes
Some people turn snitch, and state evidence
Damn this money is a son of a bitch
Don't you know it makes the good die young
Money buy guns, because paranoia comes
Along with those bucks
You better watch your back, your side and your front
Because money is a weapon, it'll fuck you up

[Verse 2: Prodigy]

I remember way before G-Unit, Aftermath, Shady
The hatred was brewing, because of my crazy
Jewelry and cars, nigga try and play me
Make me pop the hood, and pop go his Yankee
But lately, ever since all this new cash
It's a new level of hate, give me new reasons to grab
Triggers on these niggas
Jealous because I got the same car that you saw
At the magazine store
Look like you got the jewels from the back of The Source
This shit from the district, nigga I floss
Avianne watch and David bling
Got me fucking up heads, because my diamonds is pink
Little honey wants to spread her legs and get fucked
By a rich gangsta rapper, that's what's up
But you gotta stay on point, because bitches like her
Just reel a nigga in, and set a nigga up


[Hook]

Money makes hearts turn cold, friends turn foes
When jewelry get froze, women turn hoes
Some people turn snitch, and state evidence
Damn this money is a son of a bitch
Don't you know it makes the good die young
Money buy guns, because paranoia comes
Along with those bucks
You better watch your back, your side and your front
Because money is a weapon, it'll fuck you up
