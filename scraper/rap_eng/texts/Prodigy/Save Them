[Intro: Louis Farrakhan sample]
A traitor is not your brother
He hadn't learned that yet
And unfortunately, brothers and sisters
Some of these kinds of people, we will have to execute
There are people among us that we will absolutely chop their heads completely from their bodies for their betrayal of black people

[Verse 1: AZ]
This is real vomit, a monumental nigga, iconic
East coast fly shit, pay homage
As promised I display all the finest few reminders
I'm feared, don't confuse my kindness, speak ebonics
Used to get bricks on consignment before rap was all that
Black power refinement this economics
Acknowledge through the eyes of my peers exotic wears
Watch glare like a mouth of veneers, my vibe's rare
Dapper since the day of my birth
My first verse was like water for a nigga that thirst, we got it worse
Trapped on these streets in the same zone
Niggas getting bodied 'cause the beefing just came home
Shots at policemen every week and it change tones
Chicks on the shit, it's the mix, I remain strong
The drama, honor what defines my persona
I'm from a genre of drug money getters and ganja

[Interlude: Louis Farrakhan sample]
When we come to that position in time, that we have to execute you, and we will carry out the sentence of death on you just like drinking water and hang your head on a pole in the black community

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
What up gangsta? Keep it popular, it's like opera
Chilling in the one lanes, gazelle with my lockman on
Drug money bishop, used to cuddle blow in the swishes
Auto man, cocked out of suspicion
Always in the best of the best features, all I need is cameras
Surrounding us quick, go up the nina's
Murdered up flashing, 213, me and my team
Alexander McQueen, "Chef, you turned on me"
Blowing more cream, wiping the enzo off in Queens
My ghost is botanical, check the genes
All the pea coats, peacock Kangols, yo the wave game Nemo
Foul styling young Al Pacinos
Huh the money get bigger, nigga, don't make a nigga pull out
Sign you all, box you up little nigga
Meet me at the veteran's lounge
I got lamb on this wild, I'm meeting my luck, my paper growling

[Interlude: Louis Farrakhan sample]
You won't sell us out, you'll be buying your funeral
The future of our people is not to be compromised
It would be better that you were dropped in the bottom of the sea with a millstone around your neck than to betray the legitimate aspirations of our people

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Yeah, high-profile life, my verse is a gift from the Most High
You should thank God for my rhymes
I don't condone bullshit bars
The fuck is you talking about? You just wanna be around stars
Knock a nigga out, make a nigga see stars
I knock off your head, you still wanna act hard
My gun smoke like ganja
Get you higher than life, yee, that bull give you wings
Bet ey'thang on P, he's the showboat
Blast away a thing in the way of the lords
Lord to your death, don't cross me
I'll let you live if you don't press charges on me
And know rats must die
Keep them far away from punk shit, we can't buy
Don't ever attach me with them
I own my catalog, nigga, you getting pimped

[Outro: Louis Farrakhan sample]
See these position hungry ports
All you need is a promise that you gon' be a big nigga
And you'll sell out your people on a promise that the enemy will never fulfill
Keep on your feet
This is a day of separation
