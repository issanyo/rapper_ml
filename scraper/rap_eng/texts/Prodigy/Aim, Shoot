[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Yayo got the whopper, it spit longer than Papoose
Longer than Pap-longer-longer than Pap
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Yayo got the whopper, it spit longer than Papoose
Longer than Pap-longer-longer than Pap
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot

Verse 1: Papoose
Straight out the Big Apple, it’s Papoose and the Mobb
The apple was nothin' without me like Steve Jobs
At the dice game, keep a mag on me
Why would I let another man ask? Bet me
I’m the best like Khaled, I bang if I should
A nigga gotta pay me if he throw a Ace in my Hood
So the drug dealers wet work, beat all the pushers
When you was still in yo' moms crib, eatin' your boogers
I live the fast life, that’s why I stay in a hurry
Papoose be killin' the mic like Doctor Murray
King of New York, cop the caliber
My raps off the wall like a 2011 calendar
Why everybody out of character?
They all mad at me, I got 'em pissed like a catheter
Champion, I’m not ya challenger
Stop amateurs like the sandman, Banks how we handle 'em?

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Yayo got the whopper, it spit longer than Papoose
Longer than Pap-longer-longer than Pap
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Yayo got the whopper, it spit longer than Papoose
Longer than Pap-longer-longer than Pap
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Hey, yo
I'ma carry the problem fixer, I wanna argue wit'cha
One-man armed militia, nigga, you a target misser
The wrath of God'll hit ya with a horror picture
Call this rap takeout, you know Mobb deliver
Too hard for the hardest nigga, they fold like cardboard
Handle that now, nigga, ain’t no encores
Can a little heavy, so it leave the arm sore
Y'all want war, gave you what you starve for
All my shooters byproducts of the worst recession
Aim for the dome and laugh when they purchase vestses
'Cause that shit right there is irrelevant
When niggas walk around here with shit to kill a elephant
So your next move better be your best move
Like a chess move or get yo' chest moved
'Cause when we come through you better have ya guns too
Cause all we do is *aim shoot* all we do is *aim shoot*

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Yayo got the whopper, it spit longer than Papoose
Longer than Pap-longer-longer than Pap
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Yayo got the whopper, it spit longer than Papoose
Longer than Pap-longer-longer than Pap
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Back from hell, sorry I left you without no hard shit to step to
The drought is done, it’s rain season
You can’t stop my storm, you can’t slow up my flow up nah (uh uh)
It’s gonna pour cats and dogs
Thunder and lightnin' bolts, knock the lights off
When I black out make you miss me like, nigga, where you been at? Word
'Bout tired of the soft shit, it gets borin'
They look like punks and act like a woman
You need danger, a little aggression
You need excitement, I put a little pressure just to balance things out, we’re not the same
Some niggas is live, some niggas is lame
Some is real or some is fake
You draw the line in the sand, which side you claim?

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Yayo got the whopper, it spit longer than Papoose
Longer than Pap-longer-longer than Pap
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Papoose, aim, shoot
Yayo got the whopper, it spit longer than Papoose
Longer than Pap-longer-longer than Pap
