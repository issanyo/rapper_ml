[Chorus: Your Old Droog]
I can't wait until it's hoodie weather
Have me three cars and a crib when it's hoodie weather
Make heat in the summer and hold it down (why's that?)
So we can come out during hoodie weather
Thermal and hoodie weather
I remember when all I wanted was to own a nice Pelle Pelle leather
Going to buy H.N.I.C. at Sam Goody weather
Hoodie weather, couldn't be better

[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
Flow on my conehead
Screw investors I spend my own bread
Curve all they calls then lie and say my phone dead
Shoddy like Elmer Fudd, don't get thrown lead
I smell blood when that zone red
Already talking Super Bowl it's only week uno
But let's have a Mobb halftime show instead of that weak Bruno
Got bars like Mars dot the I's cross the t's roll the R's
Like Spanish reporters when they sign off
Saying their names, it's all part of the game
Lames make unsubstantiated claims
And when we called them on it they played games
Me I use the mind's intuition back on a fact-finding mission
My initiative is to live real far away from y'all
So don't ask why I don't wanna play ball
Stalemate, congressional gridlock
For those droogs, thinking we close like Joe C. and Kid Rock (yeah right)
We ain't that tight, friends never sat right with me
They shifty, and greazy
Dirty motherfuckers probably don't even wipe after ya'll shit
You that kid who used to play barefoot in the McDonald's ball pit (disgusting)
And they call me the ghetto germaphobe
Been nice since Myanmar was Burma on the globe
I'm forever residing in Remulak with that phlegm you lack
Always remember this fact


[Chorus: Your Old Droog]
I can't wait until it's hoodie weather
Have me three cars and a crib when it's hoodie weather
Make heat in the summer and hold it down (why's that)
So we can come out during hoodie weather
Thermal and hoodie weather
I remember when all I wanted was to own a nice Pelle Pelle leather
Going to buy H.N.I.C. at Sam Goody weather
Hoodie weather, couldn't be better


[Verse 2: Prodigy]
September October, November December
I dismember the 9 and put it back together
January, February, March April May
Now my stash so good I pray for a rainy day
You don't want that, quiet storm silencer guns
All you see is lightning flash the only sound was (ahh)
Don't you know you have to respect me?
Or wheelchair seat they act properly
Sometimes a man forgets you have to get violent
I tried to give niggas a chance but they don't want that
Ay, dios mio my pistol get it free throw
Cause these niggas is foul that's old beef though
Rotten apple raps straight from out the sour patch
The haters gonna hate my droog, where them bottles at?
So we can pop corks at they head
And pour some on the floor cause these niggas dead


[Chorus: Your Old Droog]
I can't wait until it's hoodie weather
Have me three cars and a crib when it's hoodie weather
Make heat in the summer and hold it down (why's that?)
So we can come out during hoodie weather
Thermal and hoodie weather
I remember when all I wanted was to own a nice Pelle Pelle leather
Going to buy H.N.I.C. at Sam Goody weather
Hoodie weather, couldn't be better
