[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Yo, big boy bars, little boy stopped
Infamous is my bread, go against this
When you get caught slippin' you gon’ cry like a bitch
And I'mma wipe my knife, on your cheap outfit
You gon' need that bandana for your dome
I punish anybody tryin’ to run up on me yo
You niggas is old, mentally you washed up
Too much time in jail, too much time it took
To get it together and put some work out Gs
Lazy motherfuckers, you don't deserve to eat
The future of my labour, I work like a slave hand
It come to survival, I'm savage like a cave man
I ain't gotta cheat you to beat you, I got this
I been had, ask about me, you late, you been askin'
Who the kid been spittin' like banana clips
And got the whole Hip-Hop head attention

[Hook: Prodigy]
My money gettin' up, my swag gettin' up
My people look nice, my money gets up
And nigga I gets down
Murder it goes down
My money gettin’ up, my swag gettin’ up
My people look nice, my money gets up
And nigga I gets down
Infamous it goes down, yeah

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Big big bank over here you just small fries
Reality rap while you tellin' more lies
The fuck is goin’ on in these days in time
These niggas is trippin', I'm sick with crazy rhymes
I'm ultra nice, I’m 16-ed up
I get loot bruh, my money is Supra
Magazine, word to Damien [?]
Champagne with my tux on, James Bond
Stay calm while I remain ruthless
Stupid nigga got his body all shottied up
He didn't think them bullets could just mindfuck
Like some jack-rabbits I got jack-hammers
These niggas tellin', had me in the slammers
