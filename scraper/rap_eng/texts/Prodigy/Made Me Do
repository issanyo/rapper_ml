[Verse 1: $ha Hef]
Come from a troubled life
At 13 I used to juggle dice
15 I learned to bubble rice
Should be doin' double life
Bark and bite, ain't the muzzle tight?
Game of life, man I saw the puzzle twice
Man I learned to the love the white
Lust the money, I don't want the hype
You want the stripes but can't front the price
Man I need another heist
Hoodie on, wake up and throw my fully on
Rap game, revenge of the nerds so I get my bully on
It's ciao time
Still got some niggas stuck on that [?]
We fuckin' up the streets, I just do this shit all my damn time
[?] and strapped up like the armed forces
I ain't beef with no niggas except the law enforcement
Hunnid grand, I'm the bad seed that made the apple rotten
Black [?] mob with them niggas that got the apple poppin'
None of y'all higher than me, I might just die about it
Only real supply is me, ain't gotta lie about it

[Chorus: $ha Hef]
Look at what y'all made me do
Look at what y'all made me do
Like to play me, who?
Bitch I'm from the baby suit
Nigga, shit I got the rabies too
At what y'all made me do
Look at what y'all made me do
Look at what y'all made me do
Like, play me who?
What y'all made me do

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Least I tried with you, now I'm done with you
Ain't no talk now nigga, only talkin' pistols
And my razor got a motor mouth on it
I blade your face, now you smile like the joker
When it rains, niggas get wet
Make a pussy call fishtail
Make a pussy truck flip over, he tried to bail
Tried to left me for dead like I'm no longer relevent
Fuck type of nigga is you? You on some strong shit
Put the drugs down boy cus your brain mushed
When keepin' it real goes wrong, and brain [?]
On some legal shit, I was on tour
On some illegal shit, I got some very long arms
You a puppet, your big homie got his hand up your ass
Nigga yo' mouth speak, that's not you
Cut out fams
Now you caught up in my bullshit, and I'm on it
There ain't no gettin' out this shit, once you start it
See?

[Chorus: $ha Hef]
Look at what y'all made me do
Look at what y'all made me do
Like to play me, who?
Bitch I'm from the baby suit
Nigga, shit I got the rabies too
At what y'all made me do
Look at what y'all made me do
Look at what y'all made me do
Like, play me who?
Look at what y'all made me do
