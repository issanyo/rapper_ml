[Verse 1]
Memories play back like film
I flash back we was little niggas living most real
1989's when we first met
We first clicked over convo gettin twisted
In dun gram earth crib cutting outta school
Watching cable it seemed like the over day
Through the eyes of a stranger we was kids
But in our own minds we was grown mens
Outside on the block we would play the bench
And y'all play the rock every chance y'all got
As I sat back and just watched
Hey, what can I say?
The same back then as I am today
I can recall me, Jamil and Jamal
In the room drinking straight vodka with they moms
When I walk home with the big nefertiti charm
Back with the light blue camoflauge suit god
Me and Hav' doing it hard trying to get on
We sample songs on the box with record and pause
Killer B didn't even get his first firearm
And I was still holding one shot derringers

Hook

Who would think anyone of us would cease to exist
Left with just thoughts of the past to reminiese
Sometimes I see a chick walking past with ya kids
Or find an old flicka of some 1-2-fifth
All the shit that we been through it boils to this?
Dun, I wish we could start it all over again

[Verse 2]
'95 we on top touring the states
A lotta times we even took the click overseas
Came along way from the hallway
Sitting in the staircase with bacardi
Bring the honeycomb speaker outside to bang
While we would share drinks with the other that came
Triple L stayed taking they cash in dice games
Killa Black grew to keep an ice grill, dun was not playin'
Yammy, the most infamous told me one day
'Put the bogies down 'fore I pound you out P'
But it was all love, we was each others duns
We held each other down, borrowed each other guns
Its hard to believe that niggas so strong
Could die so easily forever be gone
I could still feel the wet of your palm against mine
Cause we did our hand shake all the time
Why it have to be your time to go and not mines?
Spilled tears contemplating to my delf cryin'
All the laughs we shared and fights we had
All the nights we would get nice, damn
Plates of food we split in half
I dedicate the rest of my life to all my niggas that passed
