[Intro] x3
Whatever? Party's over tell the rest of the crew
Yo P, it's on you, what you wanna do?

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Every day of my life since 11-2-74
On the street makin non-stop CREAM galore
Packin heat, stickin up weed stores and more
Collectin interest off of extortions to settle my score
It gets deeper when things get real
I'm down to stick a NatWest Bank for my meal
And I'm from Hempstead, it's close to the shacks of Park Side
While I'll be outside slingin, you always hide
And don't come around to the crossroads of life
We're to the death, you and me, this beef for eternity
I'm goin out to the fullest extent
So far into my troubles it's hard for me to get back
To my everyday self and composure
Catch you when you open then I bring you to a closure
Put ice on a razor and freeze ya in ya shoulder
I went for ya grill but you dent from my boulder
I know this kid who says he knows ya because of that
Now I know where ya lay ya hat at and that's that
Say no more, I put it on you while you was yawning
Murder without warning the very next morning

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Once we step thru the door, party over, that's the endin
You and your crew'll leave out, a bunch of dead men
Bump me and I'll bump you back
You ain't tough black, niggas like you just get their life jacked
But I'mma cool nigga til you push me to the limit
But try ta play me and ya ass I get up all in it
Don't try to cop pleas now son, it's dead and done
(I gave you fair warning) So run and get your guns
It's on, time to show em how I perform
My attitude will transform, leave you dead plus wrong
Gettin the flow within, representin for Queens
Shit is real, why you hopin that it's all a dream
But you can't wake up, wettin a chest you bless
Chokin off your own blood, don't blame me you brought your own death

[Chorus]
Aiyo Noyd, it's on you, what you wanna do?
Whatever? Party's over, tell the rest of the crew
Yo Big Noyd it's on you, what you wanna do?
Whatever? Party's over, tell the rest of the crew
Yo Big Noyd it's on you, what you wanna do?
Whatever? Party's over, tell the rest of the crew
Yo Big Noyd it's on you, what you wanna do?
Whatever? Party's over, tell the rest of the crew

[Verse 3: Big Noyd]
My beeper kept beepin, the other numbers started leakin
'Who is this on my mind?' I was thinkin
Then I realised it was my dun playin 911
Once I seen the numbers I ran for the fuckin guns
My dun in trouble, I be there on the double
I jumped up in the bubble, yo kid where are you?
(1-14 between Manhattan and Morningside Avenue)
This happened just right out the blue
Aiyo dun, fuck that bitch, tell her get off your dick
(But she's cryin and she says she has feelins and shit)
Yo it's a set-up, them niggas got me fed up
Ty stay in the buildin, if they move fuckin buck em
Get up off the scene, you know what I mean?
And hold yourself down with the mother fuckin sixteen
Glock and get off they block
Then I hung up the cellular, ready to rock
And it's on

[Verse 4: Prodigy]
You get deaded in the streets, kid set it
You gots no credit, fool you get wetted
Up with the semi-auto Mac double numbered
'Did he shoot eleven or twelve?' is what he wondered
Nigga I got one more shot, you must be drinkin
Put the heater to his head, watch him start blinkin
'Am I goin to heaven or hell?' is what he's thinkin
Switch to a bitch as his life start sinkin
Down to a level of no return
Call it the heat cos when the slugs hit it definitely burns
Now chill and think about your life for real
Every member of my crew is livin life for real
Got your self fucked into somethin that you couldn't finish
Up against the fulliest squad and get diminished
I'm from Q-U-E another E-N-S
So why you small tough talk? I'm not impressed
If I seen you in the Bridge, I'd make you undress
Give up the money, the polo especially the Guess
