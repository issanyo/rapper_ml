[Part 1: Havoc]
My dick is your bitch's drug of choice
My rap status, sound of my voice
My wordplay the reason you dig me
Like archeology, the big bone [?]
She caught up in my splendor, my spotlight
Little Bambi, a deer in my headlights
Stuck off the realness, fuck off my real dick
Before you get grounded, punishment, children
Not ready for the grownup repercussions
My reaction to your actions [?]
Look at his face now, the fear
Is that a little girl I hear?
What happened to the tyrant, the tough shit?
Now you wanna stop the violence, punk
Shit fallin' out his ass, he did it on himself
Tried to shit on me, but now he shitted on himself

[Samples/Cuts (gleichzeitig Hook):]
"Stuck off the realness - you heard of us"
"Mobb Deep und Nazizi"
"Attitude is all fucked up"
"I was born a real nigga, you was made corny"
"Stuck off the realness - you heard of us"
"Mobb Deep und Nazizi"
"Attitude is all fucked up"
"I don't give a fuck about your people"

[Part 2: Fard]
Ich hab' die Medizin für dich und deinen Partydrogentrip
Alle Weiber sind verliebt, denn die Armanihose sitzt
Du hältst lieber deine Fresse, wenn die Star-Ikone spricht
Sieh: Aus Löwen werden Mäuse, wenn die Gaspistole klickt
Ein Meter neunzig, gut gebaut und große Hände
Plus 'nen Schwanz, der so dick ist, wie Caspers Oberschenkel
Chancen gegen uns habt ihr sowieso keine
Chicks fall'n reihenweise um, so wie Dominosteine
Mobb Deep und Nazizi, Cohibas und Martini
Nie wieder Dosenravioli oder -tortellini
Verdien' wie Pablo Escobar, fick' señoritas
Unbezahlbar schön, wie Leonardos Mona Lisa
Du machst auf Straßengee, der gerne Straße spielt
Doch weil man von Monopoly keine Narben sieht
Muss ich lachen, jedes Mal, wenn du von Geldhandel sprichst
Denn vor kaltem Stahl schützt dich der Pelzmantel nicht

[Samples/Cuts (gleichzeitig Hook):]
"Stuck off the realness - you heard of us"
"Mobb Deep und Nazizi"
"Attitude is all fucked up"
"I was born a real nigga, you was made corny"
"Stuck off the realness - you heard of us"
"Mobb Deep und Nazizi"
"Attitude is all fucked up"
"I don't give a fuck about your people"

[Part 3: Prodigy]
I'm on some other shit, niggas wanna hate on me
I was born a real nigga, you was made corny
Speak my name in the same breath, might as well [?]
As lungs start spitting you be missing in the mid in action
Who the fuck did it? AJ vio, clap to your people
I don't give a fuck about your people
Cause when it's on, it's on, ain't no turning it off
You the type of nigga, that position the courts
I'm dry like a bitch, when a life get lost
And wonder why your motherfucking shit get torched
Mobb for life, M-O-B-B, can't [?] wanting to beat me
Twenty years strong and we still going
And you motherfuckers still folding

Bitch ass nigga, yeah, M-O-B-B
Nam saying? Mobb Deep shit, F. Nazizi
Now we do this shit, man
Infamous life, infamous for life
We not playing games with you niggas
Fuck y'all bitches, I fuck all ya bitches and shit on ya niggas
