(Intro)
My mind and soul
Have felt like this
Since love between us
No more exist

(Verse 1)
This my song to the most high, who created all life on earth
Like the birds that fly, the sweet air we breathe
All plants and trees, the sun, and every planet in the galaxy
Yo, they feeding us bullshit with all these books
We didn't ask to be here we got took
Enslaved, and killed, we was raped and hung
We was lied to, and forced to build America
Robbed of our technology, and knowledge of self
The Black man, is the original man of this earth
We can live under the sun, it give us strength
The White man gets sun burn, and cancer of the skin
I got a lot of white friends, I'm not a racist
I acknowledge the most high, I'm not an atheist
I just tell see through the bullshit, and speak my mind
They terrified of my words, so they censor my rhymes
Good lord, I'm crying out to you
Have mercy on the slave masters souls that did us dirty
They don't give a fuck about they own poor white trash
Just imagine how they feel about my black ass
Fuck Christopher Columbus, the Indians was here first
And fuck the Vatican, the pyramids is older
Shot off the nose and lips of our statues
Mad it was black faces, staring 'Back at you'
We even built pyramids on Mars, they won't tell us about that
Cause then we'd realize who we are
When I wrote 'Pearly Gates', they said I hated God
So I wrote this song the creator, the all

(Hook)
My world is empty without you baby (without you)
My world is empty without you baby (without you)
My world is empty without you baby (without you)
My world is empty without you baby (without you)

(Verse 2)
This my song for the Almighty, the first and the last
Your bloodline is alive and healthy
These people don't scare us
They call us niggers so much, we wear it
It's like a reminder don't forget it
It's no forgiving, the evils that got the whole world possessed
Under the spell, of the mighty green dollar bill
Got us running 'round shooting people up, beating people up
Sticking people up, selling people drugs
Genocide, suicide, homicide, murder
These are the things that we see being brought up
In cartoons, movies, and history books
We go outside, and it's the real Gunsmoke
Lil' niggas in the hood got car bomb burners, fifty-two shot banana clips
Lil' devil kids getting locked up for life, and do it on purpose
We fearless, and numb to the pain and the hurting... Lord!

(Hook)
My world is empty without you baby (without you)
My world is empty without you baby (without you)
My world is empty without you baby (without you)
My world is empty without you baby (without you)
