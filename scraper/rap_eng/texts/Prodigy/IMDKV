IMDKV Queens Massacre
The Infamous Mobb Deep King Vulture rapper
What niggas wan' do when you see me off camera
Nigga strip who? I'll beat you till you lavender
You banned from the functions and concerts, cancel son
Void that, you can't cash that, stop frontin'
You ain't never see me in the streets while we was beefing
Talkin' 'bout I white flagged you and said it's all peace
When you know damn well it's apocalypse season
Get your back radiated next time you try to flee
From this punishment you got comin', don't resist
You only gonna make it worse, stand the fuck still bitch
You screamin', see motherfucker, you screamin'
Now I'mma have to stop that
Hand me the nail hammer and the baseball bat
I'mma buss his mouth open he trying to attract
The attention of them people
IMDKV, I'm evil
Straight black evil
When it call for it kidnap the pussy for torture
I'm all for it
What you thought I was Angel Cake?
You niggas is hella soft you just baby food beef
I'm dog food dope, keep your lady on a leash
When I'm outside walkin' through the world like I own this bitch
With my hoodie on, black king cobra shit
Queens nigga get the money and I stay fresh
Pockets full of dough, tippin' hundreds to the waitress
Smokin' like exotic car tailpipes
Hopin' one of y'all niggas would get right
Go on pop your gun and cut to the chase
Pussy nigga step up front, I'm cuttin' up his face
On some brutal crime shit, get your eyeball sliced
Ugh, disgusting shit, I will fuck up your life
IMDKV Queens Massacre
The Infamous Mobb Deep King Vulture rapper, what
Nigga wan' do when you see me off camera
Nigga strip who? I'll beat you till you lavender
You banned from the functions and concerts, cancel son
And rain on your parade you silly ass nigga
Jerk it motherfucker this is not a prank nigga
I'm a felon, parolee
I still smoke rollies
You ain't gotta find Jesus, I'll leave you Holy
They ain't gotta find God, I'll baptize your homies
Then crack another Patron and toast memories
I'm top of New York, bad man, nothing nice
Bitch king me, top me off like a dirty Sprite
Yo too much of my life'll get you fucked up
Way more than that LQ and blunt, dun
They rated me triple X, I'm too vulgar
I start finger-fuckin' that Mac, it's all over
