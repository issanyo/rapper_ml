Super now smoke few bottles on the sleety
Parkers on racks 'cause I raps like Christmas
Holy shit get light, get light
It's hot outside I got the keys to the bike
Gone full bottle, tonight we're going in like it ain't no tomorrow
Take drugs, make love now war I'm a gangsta hippie don't start nothing

Keys tot he crib, while I'll be poppin it all
Like belly the kid, yeah hoe whip bang it out
To the death, fuck it north
Everything from the couch to the bed
Can't stop, won't stop till they superman though
Give me superman fly
And slash oh to the hood, I'm a creature
I grew up in the woods

No time for fake ones
Come and smoke a little bit with this real ones
Live a little risky don't be a shuck one
I'm not stingy the shots on me
Oh, I'll make it hot, make it hot
I'll make it hot, make it hot
I'll make it hot, make it hot
I'll make it hot, make it hot

Yeah my pockets on loud, I'm in the string volume
My closet on swag, my balls at the top few
Best nigga spittin, pee how you livin
Couldn't be better you could say stakes giving
You're my cold bottom drop
The hood gonna cop, the streets going crazy for that new more I
Set up in the box that's where I got stronger and
Came back home, took the ice off the watch
Automor Rolex couple hew blotch
Nothing fancy just enough for the potch
When your bitch is the baddest bitch how could you not
Feel like we're gonna parry on in the spot
Get off of my flag, hoe you let dancing
Is you what you do, don't worry about the handsome
Shoot em with the rubin kill em with the baby face
And be the humble that it squeeze slugs when you're late face
Hoes wanna grip, foes wanna trip
Then ever move on me cause they know how I get
Got real street power and it ain't about..
Met the top of the fool chain now here on the block
And you just a little snack, my hunger insatiable
Easy as 1 2 3 you niggas base the cool as millions of bros
But I just take one of them, these billions of dollars
I need the one of them

No time for fake ones
Come and smoke a little bit with this real ones
Live a little risky don't be a shuck one
I'm not stingy the shots on me...
Oh, I'll make it hot, make it hot
I'll make it hot, make it hot
I'll make it hot, make it hot
I'll make it hot, make it hot
