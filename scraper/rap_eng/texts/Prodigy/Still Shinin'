[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Fresh out the motherfuckin' pack
Yo, to all my niggas uncivilized to civilized
We cook the shake move the weight across the tri-state
Them jux niggas bring the shook up out the crook type
Special deliver sending shots through your Ac' Vigor
My Infamous Mobb get on they job
The truth gets revealed like we W Fard
Some sheisty New York niggas, thirsty for cheddar
You shining, you get your jewels taken with your Hill sweater
Keeping these rap fans like crack fiends
Until we re-up, and put more Infamous up on the rap scene
Mix the coke rhymes with beats just like baking soda
Albums is G-Packs selling across foreign waters
My Mobb picks is like dime bricks
Satisfaction, guaranteed real shit
Rapper Noyd, we meet you at the top kid
And once we all on top ain't no stopping it
I'm headstrong, at peace with myself like Islam
You stupid, a hundred niggas form around me
Like force field, pull out and use the gun like shield
The crew is worldwide, to think we started from the hill
Beware, of quiet niggas laying in the cut (For what?)
Patiently watching waiting for a come up
Get your spot took, we rob land like white man
Plans to overthrow your whole shit while shaking your hand

[Hook]
Up the ladder of success with Tecs, we build and destroy
Still shining, still climbing
Up the ladder of success with Tecs, we build and destroy
Still shining, still climbing

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Nine-six to the motherfucking year two G
The Mobb got it locked with the master keys
Word life combination to the safe it's on
Get that loot motherfucker, spread love when you on
The 41st got the heat for them niggas that thirst
Yes divine nine shine put that ass in line
Regulate, I'm only here just to take what's mine
My shit combine, dangerous minds done bust the outline
A half a man generating grands
Kid, you know how I go, only fuck with fam
That's why you're looking from the outside in
Wondering how we bubbling, hustling, breaking days in
Grimy motherfuckers, getting info from your baby's mother
Got her pillow talking while that ass is sleepwalking
So all that bullshit you did, I know where you live
You better be on point when you walk in the rest
Your broke ass probably don't got a vest
So I suggest change your location is best
'Cause I'm coming through army fatigue dressed
Blessed with hollow tips yes, to burn through your dirty ass Guess
(Yes, still shining, still climbing)

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
A-yo, your timing was way the fuck off, what is you trying?
This faggot ass cat should get clapped for even trying
He tried to confront me but only faced iron
Put holes through your shirt like Jamaican clothes
Fuck the myths, but science in numbers is how I live
If we ain't getting mathematics something got to give
Broke all your fucking life with no will to live
There's no way to live, resort to Plan B
Start to sticking, strong arm robbery and ice picking
It's sneak vicking, it's cold outside
I think it's past time for me to grab the clapper and take mines
You follow what I'm saying, it's like leading the blind
Trying to voice a clear picture of this life of crime
You slow learners'll understand in due time
Up the ladder of success with Tecs, we trying to eat
And put that fly shit on my back
And bless my feet with some new and improved, spectate or make a move
Hesitate or regulate it's on you

[Hook]
Up the ladder of success with Tecs, we build and destroy
Still climbing, still shining
Up the ladder of success with Tecs, we build and destroy
Still shining, still climbing
Up the ladder of success with Tecs, we build and destroy
Still shining, still climbing
Up the ladder of success with Tecs, we build and destroy
What?

9-6 motherfucker...
The Infamous...
