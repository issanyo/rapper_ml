[Intro: 2Pac]
You gotta snatch some cowards and let them motherfuckers know you're gonna take them out, any time you feel like it!

[Verse 1]
I need a gangsta bitch
Give me a gangsta bitch
I wanna gangsta do it with my gangsta bitch
Give me a gangsta bitch

She G'd up, tell that bitch to call me
She like it rough I fuck that bitch the long way
All night, now I'm on her my all day
She mines now, for ever and for always
Lame niggas, they belong with them lame hoes
Punk bitches, they belong with them punk dudes
Get yourself a bird, I got me a lioness
Pretty thug love, on that Clyde & Bonnie shit

[Hook]
Pretty thug, my bitch a pretty thug
Pretty thug, my bitch a pretty thug
Pretty thug, bitch I'm a pretty thug
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 2]
Flyboy, me a rudeboy
Me a gunman, me a shoot boy
For mi rude gyal
Me a do a thousand years in the dungeon
I don't fuck around when it come to her
And she don't play when it come to me
Our love from the stars above
We infamous, this destiny
Bet it never be another two like
Me and baby the Clarence and Alabama type
If we die, we be in love on the other side
I be the bitch, she be the nigga in another life
God put us together, only God can stop us
We cut our palms, hold hands, now we blood partners
Sacrificial love, bitch I give my heart to you
Love me to pieces, I give every part to you
Handsome, gangster, look my face you got a dime
Gorgeous thug, just look her face and pretty eyes
Our little baby boy or girl gon' be trouble
And when we gone, they gon know their parents was some...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You can never bag my bitch homie
I know that she loyal to me
She know that you not that nigga you claim to be, c'mon stop it whoadie
I get the baddest women, you only pulling skanks
I spit that real life to 'em, you niggas spitting game
Say what I mean, mean what I say
If I tell that bitch to come on
That bitch best move without haste
Yeah she gangbang, she crazy
My gangstress, my lady
Ask what set she claiming
She gon' say that gang P

[Bridge]
Gangsta bitch, give me a gangsta bitch
I wanna gangsta do it with my gangsta bitch
Give me a gangsta bitch

Gangsta bitch, I got a gangsta bitch
Smoking gangsta ouuwie, with my gangsta bitch
I got a gangsta bitch

[Hook]
