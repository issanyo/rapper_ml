[Verse 1]
Everything not Illuminati, everything not a evil plot, nah
Everything not the black boul√©, sometime people just get shot
Caught up in a random act of violence
Murder over dumb shit
Everything is not connected
Some things are, but you buggin'
You takin' it too far
Stop starin' up at space
Pay attention to life on Earth
You worried about the wrong things
Let's talk legislation, all these laws changing, foreign bankers
Let's talk Proposition 37, let's practice the First Amendment
She say she love when I speak my truth
She search for me her whole life
I tell her, "Go 'head, keep searchin'
'Cause you ain't never gon' find
Another with my balance, my vibration, I resonate"
My pull is magnetic, I'm attractive
But I give more than I hold

[Hook]
Get some 350s, nine millis, extendo 47s
They want us to all disarm, but we ain't givin' up our weapons (Fuck no)
It's the USA, mafuckin' USA, the US of A
We're black and beautiful, black is powerful
And we all here to stay
Right here in the United States
Mafuckin' USA, the US of A
Look, we are all beautiful, all powerful
All one human race

[Verse 2]
Big up to sistren and brethren around the globe
To sleeping giants have awoken
Life to us is like Play-Doh
We just shape the shit how we want it
Come graduate from that old school
This is higher learning, we past that
Take a leap of faith and just let go
We waitin' for you in the aftermath
Behind The Wizard's curtain
This ain't Kansas for certain
We live in living color
Backstage at the Truman Show
Everything not three dimensions
There's so much more to be seen
Open up your third eye or you gon' miss everything
Then in the middle of all this
I got people with larceny in they heart for me
I must hold down the fortress
Stay alive and stay out the penitentiary
Better wisely choose your battles
Try not to think so small
It's a big psychedelic picture
Better turn your hatred to love, maybe not though
