[Verse 1]
Bright gangsta, I'm a cool brotha
Smart mothafucka, and I still shoot guns
For the life of me, can't figure these people out
I try to love them, but they pull the hatred out
From inside of me, the lion was tryin' to sleep
Yeah you fucked up now, you just woke up the beast
Now it's skull and bones all over the turf
I take the show on the road, that's all over the earth
It's P, not Diddy and the Family
I dry mop niggas up, it won't even be
One drop of blood, no trace for the forensics
I clean up nice when I take a devil head
And Lord knows, I'm a godsend, I'm anti
Satan and you antichrist, it's all in the eyes, chico
They the windows to the soul
And I can see fake people with my eyes closed
I done told you

[Hook]
But y'all niggas still got the nerve
To try to hustle a hustler, it don't work
Cold blooded nigga, city of cold hearts
It's no fear out here, we not scared of y'all
But y'all niggas still got the nerve
To try to hustle a hustler, it don't work
Cold blooded nigga, city of cold hearts
It's no fear out here, we not scared of y'all

[Verse 2]
Arabian sword cut the head off of snakes
You 10 thousand years old, you need to have a seat
And let the young Gs rise up and take power
We tryin' heal the world, you tryin' devour
The earth and its resources, killin' babies
Poison in the water and synthetic seeds
We a new breed of kids, we on some shit
We don't believe your books, we got our own connection
With the universal life force, they pass laws
But the law of the land is not maritime law
I'm talkin' etymology, see what I'm tryna say
We not really free, we just are new slaves
Yeah, we still slaves, we still slaves
They took the chain off our wrists and put it on our brains
I'll take this gun off my hip and put it to your brains
You try to stop me from bein' great, it won't happen

[Hook]
But y'all niggas still got the nerve
To try to hustle a hustler, it don't work
Cold blooded nigga, city of cold hearts
It's no fear out here, we not scared of y'all
But y'all niggas still got the nerve
To try to hustle a hustler, it don't work
Cold blooded nigga, city of cold hearts
It's no fear out here, we not scared of y'all
