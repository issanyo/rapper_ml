[Intro: Raekwon]
Yeah, this your brother Raekwon right here
Rozay special, what up?
Fourth floor, no doubt, corridor
It's filled with all kinda whores
(Maybach Music)

[Hook: Rick Ross]
So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted to V-12 Benzes
The rush of audio meth it comes instant
Every breath I take I'm paid interest
So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted, canary yellow diamonds
Chinese AK's that shoot silent
Most gangstas choose to die violent

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Diamond'd up Eagle G, diesel weed slingin' needles
Heroin drawn from my cerebral
Paint artist, lace you with scars, and tarnish everythin' on you
Take you out your jewels, now undress
New York savages, hunt scavenges
Son, get his address, mac and a Jag, the nigga asked for this
Play low, my killas, they say go
Catch him in snake mode, bite him, then jump in a gray boat
Dope verse fresh in the blow store, comin' out heat first
So when we meet, it's a deep thirst
Winners take winners, we invest
Keep it on the up and up, just like Khaled, we the best, nigga

[Hook: Rick Ross]
So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted to V-12 Benzes
The rush of audio meth it comes instant
Every breath I take I'm paid interest
So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted, canary yellow diamonds
Chinese AK's that shoot silent
Most gangstas choose to die violent

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
The Maybach parallel, seats caramel
Fly as airmail, Killa Beez parasail
The luger black, the brick white
The boy brown, good night
Coupe red, streets dark
Scare snakes out the grass when the tree spark
Backwoods, no white boys
Movin' white? Better look out for them white boys
Got a white Beamer,got a white six
White man's world, can suck a big black dick
Got a nigga down the street down to murder somethin'
Couldn't have nothin', shit now he work or somethin'

[Hook: Rick Ross]
So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted to V-12 Benzes
The rush of audio meth it comes instant
Every breath I take I'm paid interest
So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted, canary yellow diamonds
Chinese AK's that shoot silent
Most gangstas choose to die violent
So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted to V-12 Benzes
The rush of audio meth it comes instant
Every breath I take I'm paid interest
So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted, canary yellow diamonds
Chinese AK's that shoot silent
Most gangstas choose to die violent

[Outro: Rick Ross]
I'm addicted to the euphoria
I'm addicted to the euphoria
I'm addicted to the euphoria
I'm addicted to the euphoria
