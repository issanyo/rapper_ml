"And if you start some shit your ass had better run.."

[Verse 1: Havoc]

Shit is real on the muthafucking hill, God
Times is hard, visons blurred kid, I can't see far
Thinking will I be the next nigga deceased
Over some bullshit beef I pack heat
Son it's '94 and I ain't going out like that
Never roll a dollo cuz my crew got my back
And it's a fact, niggas don't know how to act
Till I cop back, react, leave 'em laying on they back
Sometime I try to maintain and chill
Stop my brain from thinking, restrain from grabbing my steal
I'm stressed out, trying to live right on the wrong route
Thinking of ways to get loot in large amounts
So I chill on the block, nigga respect mines
A giver wit the mac and the motherfucking tech nines
So pack steel if you come through, front if you want to
Before you do, so let me warn you

"Cuz you're in: The Bridge, the, the Bridge!"

[Verse 2: Havoc/Big Noyd]

Fallin' in and out, kid, I can't sleep
My body's in the bed and my mind's in the streets
At all times, with more crimes
At it, packing automatics, bringing straight up havoc
So tell your crew, a nigga do what he gotta do, lyrically hostile
With missions impossible/I'm stepping to your business
You punk ass perpetrator, sending the stitches to all y'all motherfucking violators
So recognize and realize, I'm not the nigga lie
You better ask somebody, I'm out to do or die
Either I'ma make it or die trying, and I ain't lying
You know I pack the motherfucking iron
So all y'all non-believes sleeping with your enemies
You offending me, you don't want any part of me
I'm on the fliggedy, the flow, I'm out the bo'
I'm on my way, grab my leather pelle, my 9 I pack everyday
That's how I'm living, I'm Illin' just like a villain
I got no time for chilling, cuz I'm massive, I'm killing
The Jakes and the snakes, whoever's in my motherfucking way
I don't play, I pack that heat everyday
So kiss her in your level, don't disrespect the rebel
You don't want any trouble, cuz I burn just like the devil
My mind is full of crime, my brain reacts when that foul shit
That made me pack the heat, stroll the streets, rollin Mobb Deep
Shouts to all my niggedies, fuck all my enemies, especially when
Niggas roll mistakenly
A nigga almost bagged me, he had me, nigga tried to grabbed me
I pulled out my banger and blew his ass badly, I'm nasty
With crazy mentality, starting a catastrophe, livin life tragedy
You know you gettin jumped punk
It ain't no one on ones, when it's time to dump
Tell em, dun, I smoke his ass like a blunt
Reach for my spine, pull out my nine, cock it one time
Made him lay down, don't move around cuz your ass is mines
Gave a crook look, I got him shook, he on the floor flinchin
Now he's bitchin, got him snitchin, listen
I pistol whipped him, Now check this
The nigga got me vexed, cuz I capped his ass
And jumped back in my Lexus

[Verse 3: Prodigy]

Welcome to the nine square, nine four
Niggas better step to the door like they ready for more
You want action we bring it, it couldn't be simpler
You could get crippled or hurt tryna fight back
I'd advice you all to just stay home
Cause if you beef you'd be running for the payphone
Hoping that cops come to save your ass
I caught you looking making sure it's save to pass
Through the buildings, quick like the wind blow
Not knowing we was watching from the staircase windows
In case you was thinking bout tryna leave
I suggest that you calm down and breath
Because I hate to break it to you but you ain't going no place
What made your outta-town-ass come in the first place
Nigga you ain't in no place to showcase them jewels you got
Next thing the nigga heard was gunshots
Two to his dome so his last thought is hot
So long as i don't know him, he can rot
As jakes look over the hill, their eyes sees nothing but nighttime
Due murders at an unseen right time
My sales run through underground pipelines and process
Loot with progress, and remain floor proof
You better keep your heat in hands reach
Cause I ain't tryna hear no words, or speeches
Get into your skin like leeches
I'm learning this thing that my streetlife teaches
You came as a whole but you leaving in incomplete pieces
And didn't expect to meet Jesus in your adolescence
Sending you back to the essence
So you can feel at home and safe in God's presence
