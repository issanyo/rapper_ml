(Aight, cool, *inhales* take a seat dunn)
(Uh, huh, word up uh huh uh huh)
(Step aside uh huh uh huh, fuckin' bitches uh huh uh huh)

[Hook: Havoc]
There that go, feel my gat blow (Repeat 4X)

[Verse 1]
[Prodigy]
Rocket takes form, songs bring down the forum
Sedate niggas and relate towards em
Tech's/text marvel, Infamous cuttin' sole parcel
Ship a box to your local ragaposatory
Mind twirler, my discourse'll throw a nigga further
Off balance, expose your true colors
You ain't thugged out, I damn near fell out
Hearin' y'all niggas run at the mouth

[Havoc]
Yo, runnin' at the mouth, no-no
Put it back in replay, slow-mo, rollin' for dolo
Crash shit like a 9-8 brand new whip
Flash shit like ice from Diamond District
Cock biscuits, live and dangerous, the risk shit
Son, ya heard, are you listening? Then stop bitchin'
'Cause we gun paid; put me down, get made
Get bent as hell; talk shit, get laid

[Hook: Havoc]
There that go, feel my gat blow (Repeat 4X)

[Verse 2]
[Prodigy]
There that go
Two ways: Either with your dick or with the fifth
I spit flames at him quicker than I forgive
Put your life on it, Mobb niggas holdin' shit
Down for the cause, respect the IMD, or take a L
Respect my QB rep and not yours, yo
Move them niggas aside and take force, dunn
You can't hold us, security can't control us
Comin' out the venue tore up, what

[Havoc]
Bone your chick, push whips, invest shit
If I wreck shit, cop the next shit then make a right on red
Handle business, do shit, confuse the feds
Never lose my head, push your wig instead
Rapper Noyd on my side so that's extra bread
Fuck it, I'm shiesty, yo, there's kids to be fed
Little dunn-dunn's got me goin' hard for the lump sum
Bite the hand that feed you and I let you know how we do

[Hook: Havoc]
There that go, feel my gat blow (Repeat until end)
