[Verse 1: Nicole]
Ugh, who you talkin' to
I wanna know
Is that chick with you
Do you love her
Besta tell the truth
Or you'll end up in a ICU
Boy, I got thing for you
And I'd do anything for you
But I need to know a thing or two
Am I the only one you callin' boo

[Chorus]
Don't lie to me baby
I would love to be your lady
But you be actin' crazy
And I wouldn't do it if you payed me
I would love to make it alright
And I would love to fuck all night
But damn it's not alright
Damn it's not alright

[Verse 2: Nicole]
Ugh, who you rollin' with
Do I meet all the benefits
Is these the only lips that you kiss
Am I the only one you fuckin' with
Boy, I got a thing for you
And I've been holdin' it down for you
And I be pissin' around for you
Am I the only one you callin' boo

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Am I
The only one that you callin' boo
Cuz I know I will always satisfy you
And nigga don't try to run no games
Cuz I'm so hot I'll take you down in flames..

[Prodigy]
Is this for real
Wow Nicole Wray
Pleasure to meet you

Damn yeah
I'm a fan of yours to
But damn
I gotta be honest
I'm tryna geta at you
And I don't run games
I'm runnin' witchu
You runnin' with P
Would that be possible
Now that's a dream team
You rockin' R&B
I got the streets
And it's mad cuz I'm Mobb Deep
What's goin' take to convince you
What a nigga gotta do to get with you
It couldn't be more for real
Listen girl
I couldn't be more sincere
You make a nigga wet dream
Girl c'mon
I ain't the type that'll hound you
But I'ma dog
And I'ma flirt just to sharpen the saw
Smooth, you see yourself rockin' with a nigga like that
Here's my cell, your two way crib
Holla back..
