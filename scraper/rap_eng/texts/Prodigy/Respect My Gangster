[Intro: The Alchemist + (Prodigy)]
Gangster…gangsta…respect my gangster
Yeah, respect my gangsta
Yeah yeah yeah, respect my gangster
(We duffin’, we bustin’, you know that it’s on)
Gangster (Either or, we gon’ lock horns)
Respect my gangster
(We bustin’, we duffin’, you know that it’s on)

[Verse 1: The Alchemist]
Yeah, respect my gangster, ‘cause I ain’t nothin’ to play with
Yo, I walks that righteous path so I’m protected from danger
And I ain’t runnin’, I stay with
My clique when the shit gets thick (Why?) ‘cause I’m a team player
And I ain’t frontin’, I’m laying it up
Down to the tape so quick you think I was the Speed Racer
As a percussion, I’m lacing ‘em with the…
Yeah, yo, you can expect that flavor
Layers, the different ways to do the regular (That’s right)
‘Cause that’s how I gets my paper
And I ain’t stuntin’, I’m making it
Look so simple but it’s so complex, it gets deeper
Y’all gotta follow the footsteps
Watch, learn, and study the manuscripts
Drop, earn, and work with the fans you get

[Hook: The Alchemist + (Prodigy)]
Respect my gangster…gangster
Respect my gangster…gangster
Yeah yeah yeah, respect my gangster
(We duffin’, we bustin’, you know that it’s on)
Gangster (Either or, we gon’ lock horns)
Respect my gangster
(We bustin’, we duffin’, you know that it’s on)

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Yeah, yo, yo, nigga, hold mines
Is you stupid? We’re a goldmine
You front on us, you get shot three or four times
On different occasions, I keep giving it to you
And save the death shot for last, it’s beautiful
How I handle it, I’m not a menace
They ain’t got a word for how I bring it
A little psychotic but that’s an understatement
A little narcotics’ll put me in a place where
I can get my mind off all of y’all fake shit
Just look at how we raised you, and still raising you
Y’all niggas are duh-dun-duh-dunts, you hear me on the news
It ain’t ‘cause loose shot (nah), ain’t ‘cause I’m stabbed
Word, they screamin’ my name? I musta got bagged
And I ain’t tryin’ to say I can’t get it
‘Cause I’m a nigga in the midst of this shit where everybody could get wrapped
Niggas wanna see if my shit is easy to grab
Reaching on me is like reaching for God, so say your prayers

[Hook: The Alchemist + (Prodigy)]
Respect my gangster…gangster
Respect my gangster…gangster
Yeah yeah yeah, respect my gangster
(We duffin’, we bustin’, you know that it’s on)
Gangster (Either or, we gon’ lock horns)
Respect my gangster
(We bustin’, we duffin’, you know that it’s on)
