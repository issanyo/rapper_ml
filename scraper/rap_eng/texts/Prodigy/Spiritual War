[Hook]
I see you got your spin, careful with that shit
Quiet on the set, police on our neck
Your head, light that up, let me get that Ace
Unholy water, my cup
In this mental, physical, spiritual war
Yeah it's a spiritual war
It's an actual, factual, supernatural war

[Verse 1]
Listen, I've got a diamond heart, 24 karat blood
My body is my temple, bitch, I am the plug
Whole universe is my outlet, I and I, we are one
Respect the flower of life, or get your petal plucked like
She love me or she love me not?
You love me or you love what I got?
It's okay if you're scared, turn your fear into power
We got serpents in the garden, some of those apples are sour
GMO

[Hook]
Careful with that shit
Quiet on the set, police on our neck
Your head, light that up, let me get that Ace
Unholy water, my cup, a little Henny
In this mental, physical, spiritual war
Yeah it's a spiritual war
It's an actual, factual, supernatural war

[Verse 2]
I've got a diamond heart, 24 karat blood
My body is my temple, bitch, I am the plug
Whole universe is my power source, I stay on, I stay lit
At 1.21 gigawatts, I brainstorm, start rainin'
Start rainin', startin' rainin'
At 1.21 gigawatts, I brainstorm and start rainin'
On you warriors, we not scared
We stand in front your tanks like Tiananmen Square

[Hook]
I see you got your spin, careful with that shit
Quiet on the set, police on our neck
Your head, light that up, let me get that Ace
Unholy water, my cup
In this mental, physical, spiritual war
Yeah it's a spiritual war
It's an actual, factual, supernatural war
I see you got your spin, careful with that shit
Quiet on the set, police on our neck
Your head, light that up, let me get that Ace
Unholy water, my cup
In this mental, physical, spiritual war
Yeah it's a spiritual war
It's an actual, factual, supernatural war
