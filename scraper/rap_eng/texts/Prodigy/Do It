[Verse 1: Prodigy]
P
Pack up
All you out your league
I be the Head Nigga In Charge
Y'all be the niggas under me
This is my house
What the fuck you think
You get spanked comin up in my shit
I run this
My shit pop like them white boys on MTV
Your shit sound weak when its played after me
There is no competition
I'm the number 1 album of 2000
Cause your shits suck
Me and Hav be the best niggas to ever do it
What you think its just music
We live this shit
We from the soil the dirt the grain the pain
It still hurts
You can never satisfy my thirst
Y'all niggas had best disperse
I charge niggas with intent
You ain't gangstas
Go ahead jump and get plucked nigga
My guns buck and we love to fuck niggas up

[Hook: Prodigy]
If yall niggas want to get at P
Do it
You got problems you want it with me
Come one
If you gangstas, gangbangers, thugs what
Do it do it come on do it
If the ladies want to holla at P
Do it
Gettin hot you want to slide with me
Come on
For my mamis honeys big body bunnies
Come on come on do it

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
And the shit that kill me
Is radio be acting like they can't feel me
Said we too filthy
We uncensored
Not to mention all the drama and tension
When we step in
Your event get shut down when we dumb out
We got good hearts though we ain't start the bout
We just brawled em out and hauled em out
Promoters get scared and put on the lights for the house
Dun we just tryin to have fun
Boo at the ladies and possibly get in the jump
You crazy
You get blown open son
You tried to stop that flow on a big showboat and got cut the most
While your dogs afloat
Me and mines keep partyin and sparkin dope
Its simple
P is not to be fucked with
Put your thugs up put your guns up and shit

[Hook: Prodigy]
If yall niggas want to get at P
Do it
You got problems you want it with me
Come one
If you gangstas, gangbangers, thugs what
Do it do it come on do it
If the ladies want to holla at P
Do it
Gettin hot you want to slide with me
Come on
For my mamis honeys big body bunnies
Come on come on do it
