[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I get you up, stick you up, cut you up
Gut you up, hit you up, touch you up
Bust you up, fuck you up
La dada di, yeah do
A million rip riders all draped in blue
Now follow my lead, all ya'll fall on your knees
Hands up to the sky with your head down low
Hoping and wishing I'm missin' with the chrome fo fo
Praying for my enemies cause them not know
Oh nooo,  here comes the bad guy
I spit the truth like your rabbi
Ain't no witnesses the way that I been flippin' this
Now what's infinite is I'm magnificent
And I mob deep everywhere that I been
Shouts out to my homies in the motherfuckin' pen
Yeah, still off the juice and gin
Twenty years later cousin and I'm at it again

[Hook: Prodigy]
Off top, guns pop, infamous Mobb Deep
We get down baby, we get down
Off top, panties drop, honies want to roll with me
It's going down baby, it's going down
X2

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Yeah, I hear a lot of noise in the background
So who I got to attack now
I'm more wilder than this rap crowd
Talking out your ass, leave you assed out
I'm mob all day nigga
Front on my niggas, I let it spray nigga
Hammer on my waist know that way bigger
Hit you anoerexic like I'm way thicker
Stay in your lane son
That wasn't you from day one
Out wildin' the drug money we cake from
Out wildin' profilin' it ain't nothin'
Long story short niggas know what it is
And what it ain't, put the hammer to your ribs
And there ain't nothin' bout us glitzy
'Til the wheels fall of or the feds come and get me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
New York nigga, hoodie rap, never say weak shit
On my worst day I get off, nigga I eat this
Best niggas in rap that Mobb Deep shit
Spit a vicious verse, you bite you be teethless
I live a vicious life, trife and real devious
I leave you outside buck naked like a hedonist
I insist, make a move flinch
Please nigga I am dying to use this
New toy I bought fresh out the plaster
Revenge fucker like I'm fresh out the bandage
Back from the dead, thought it was a wrap huh?
May lead caps hit your head like a Mac truck
I am too good
They labeled me a legend and I'm right where I should
I'm right where I'm supposed to, lampin' holding my dick
My feet up talking on the phone with my bitch
Another hundred thou', do the mathematics
Another man down, killing these rappers
Do the mathematics
Another man down, killing these rappers

[Hook]
