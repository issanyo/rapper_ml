Then it goes a little something like this

Award show life, get dressed
Red carpet, cameras, get fresh
It's best you always look your best
'Cause us weekly and team z don't slip nah
Award show life, yeah we
Cameras, seats and arm candy
All access, badges, backstage passes
Big dark sunglasses, to match it

My life is like a video, eryday's a movie
The press tryna kill me, please don't shoot me
Coming out the spot with my mistress love
Holding hands and kisses and hugs
Front row, next to Bieber, Kanye and Carmen
In the spotlight life, Biggy told me you on touring
We was doing shows tryna reach our goals
He said P, don't forget how you got where you going
I was just a little nigga back then, I didn't care
If I didn't have a tux, afford a black tie fair
'Cause it wasn't my type of party, type of crowd
I'd rather be with a â€¦shootouts go down
A young ball mentality, ball down
When you grow up in the hood
You live the hood lifestyle
Now I own, network with big millionaires
And you prolly seen my picture in Vanity Faire

Award show life, get dressed
Red carpet, cameras, get fresh
It's best you always look your best
'Cause us weekly and team z don't slip nah
Award show life, yeah we
Cameras, seats and arm candy
All access, badges, backstage passes
Big dark sunglasses, to match it

I'm a publicity whore, fiend to be seen
I die for more air time on the screen
Nah, 15 minutes ain't enough for me
I need the endless run, don't try to kill my dream
I got a rock star house wife, she like nice things
Tavern on the green, breakfast at Tifanny's
Strictly Rolex and Cartier on her wrist
She high maintenance, it's my fault she like this
Spoil my bitch, award show lifestyle
We on our way to another show right now
My son growing up he thinks he Chris Brown
My lil daughter need that college money no doubt
I must bust my ass continue to shine
I cannot stop no, on the road I'ma die
Just like, give me my props
So I'ma take mine and climb over you, city top

Award show life, get dressed
Red carpet, cameras, get fresh
It's best you always look your best
'Cause us weekly and team z don't slip nah
Award show life, yeah we
Cameras, seats and arm candy
All access, badges, backstage passes
Big dark sunglasses, to match it
