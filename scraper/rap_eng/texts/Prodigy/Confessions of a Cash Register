[Verse 1: Prodigy]
All I got for these niggas is expletives and slugs
All I got for these bitches is big dick and drugs
Alcohol and guns
Don't be scared now you got it thug
Smart enough to chill the fuck out
Until it's time to dump
Release so much rage in such a short space
I'll put your face in your cornflakes, mobb style
You gave them Goma power
Your honey want it, nigga, hold it down
Hood nigga she love my style
I knocked the cat out
Nigga I'll pull a Lufthansa
Nigga is that your bitch I took that back to the casa
I'm always pulling the heist I can't help that
Bitches wanna
You know what that ride be like with just one night
I blow up mine and get low
There's to much dough out here to be broke
So I hit the curb
And bend a few corners bumping this shit here
Turnt all the way up
Niggas getting robbed tonight, let's be clear
Come up off of them things
A nigga gone die tonight, I leave you here
You give me your valuables
No funny moves, I swear

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Uhhh
Man walked in with a smile on his face and a
Loaded 45 in his hand
Told the clerk "Don’t move, I didn't come here to shoot
But I will, so you must understand" Bang!
Shots in the air, No time to waste
Been doin' drugs all day, now his mind erased
Fuck the register, he better find the safe
Get the money, hit his homies up and congregate
I need bread, my kid need to be fed
This is the recession, going through depression
I ain't done sinning cause I ain't done winning
Gotta be fucked up to make it to the top, where the money at?
I could be next to me, Death in Venice
Work at CBS and one day you’ll manage
Rejects, emotionally damaged
You kids need a shrink, let me call Rick Moranis
Want to get a crib in Atlantis
Knocked the bitch out cold, she Rick Rambis
Tell Dorothy we ain't in Kansas, Livin in this world
But we don't understand it, No!
Bullshit, you can't sell that
All these kids will get held back
A cup filled and my L fat
Thinking we just want Dave Chappelle back, well, until that
I’m coming through the function with some subjects for discussion
Yep, thats Alchemist in production
Little bit of Larry Fish yeah it's nothing
God versus man, lion versus lamb
Competition ain't shit
Ima treat you all like my bitch
Start by sucking this dick!
BIOTCH!!!
