[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Statik, uh
NYC the borough, Queens super lean
Cut the fat, lame niggas get the fuck away from me
I'm a five borough, keep it thorough, gutter MC
White ball, puerto rock, black all fuck with me
Get your brain right, you versus me, we're not the same type
Money over dumb shit, champagne, give me a light
Shoot the shit, smoke a spliff with your bwoy
I don't play that game you be playing with them boys
I'm a grown-ass man, hit the mag at your liver
Then smoke a couple bags for the fact you got hit up
Ride around bumping Kendrick Lamar, the homies
Looking for a great time, never mind ya'll police-ass niggas

[Hook x2]
I keep my circle tight like a pinky ring
Niggas want my life cause I get major bank
The 3-5 get 'em, sic 'em Fido, bark bark
No sunshine I put 'em where it's dark

[Verse 2]
Lights out bitches, my Guiness Stout niggas
Rain on your Budweiser bullshit, my crew get
Hard like rock wilders, you know my style by now
Your bitch know she respect my dick
Young alien told me "P, get these niggas then"
Statik threw the beat on, I keep keeping on
Call me crazy as long as you call me like bab say
Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Harlem, matinee
Early, niggas dozing on Long Isl' niggas
Staten Isl' niggas force us to pull triggas
I ain't even really on it like that, until you try me
Never sleep on a nigga, quiet the irony
I bang on you so loud I put you with the crickets
I put you up under the dirt, who is you kidding?
This is violence in its purest form, catch a body rap
Baby I will body that, pussy cat
Scream at your friendly neighborhood bandana P, mami
I give you extended play, he short you, but not me
I take you to another realm you ain't never been
This that private stock that dope like the heroin

[Hook x2]
