Uh-huh, yeah, here comes another one

(Most def.. most definitely)

[Prodigy]
Aiyyo Hav' man (yeah) kick that shit my nigga

[Havoc]

[Hook 2X: Havoc]
Wanna be thugs, there's sugar in they tank
Wanna be thugs, no cash in the bank
Wanna be thugs, up North get raped
Wanna be thugs, flashin jewels get ganked

[Havoc]
Yo I seen all types be the victim of a kite
Be like, them silly fishes be the first one to bite yo
They see the cheese but they don't see the trap
Not a real live cat, but a real live rat
You got, broken guns, the first to run
First to leave, first to abandon your team
Yo you wonder who I'm talkin about?
I'm standin right next to you ass, the one that you got in doubt
First to shout, to get you into some bullshit
Now you're all drownin, cause loose lips sink ships
Do you like Hav'?  He be like, hell no
It works, cause you know, that the fuckin truth hurts
I just, let niggas bring 'em down in the day they cool
After six they throw on the nightgown
Loud sounds, expected after sundown
Man down, half crowns get shotdown and right now

[Prodigy]
Yo.. aiyyo we leave niggas with dry blood on they face
Put slugs where your bones at, break you off a taste
Shots of tequila, plenty Henny, we drinkin heavy
Smokin dust, Dunn I brought mez(?) tabs with me
And to my mamis on ecstasy
C'mon, we can bungee in the V.I.P
We turn bitches out, take turns in that bitch mouth
Carve niggas up, show niggas what it's all about
It's us, the best of Queens, handguns to minks
Top fashion, we flash and bang
Niggas think they Flash Gordon, we snatch the link
Cause we mafioso and you the average dick
Kid, we send messages through bottles
Crash your face with the Mo, have glass all in your nostrils
And run through y'all niggas like the shits
Kick niggas with the boots, dukes we get biz, youse a
