Oh you'se dead mothafucka

[Prodigy]
Just look into my eyes, you see there's no bullshit
And I'ma professional, drama bring a .9 slinger
Just look at my face; do I look like I'm playing with you?
Listen to my verse; Do it sound like I'm a scared fool? NO!
I don't give a fuck when I rap
You see me in the street it's the same way I act
It's not movie dawg, it's a reality show
So that'll be real good when that cali-coat blow

(Chorus) Prodigy
Welcome to the life of V.I.P
On DVD 'cause shit too violent for MTV
There's niggas being killed; bitches being fucked
There's drugs being sold; our money getting up

[Big Twinz]
If you look into my mind; all you see is hate dunn
The blood's everywhere, but most of 'em is fake one's
I load up the .9, trying to get payload
I take everything from you shoes to your Kangol
You gotta give it up or get your arm chopped off
Niggas know my name - Big Twinz pop off
The fiends know wassup, I'm the one to cop off
I'm not soft, Infamous fire like hot-sauce

[Prodigy]
Get a load of real shit, the hemi go bang
The swami go rang, in the shoot & range
So I could perfect my aim
Stick you like a dope needle how a nigga aim
Sharp-shooter, top shotta, top fire rapper
Voted most likely to knock back up...
I pick the ratch[et] up and cap you up
Night or day it don't matter
The skateboarder, surfboarder, snowboarder
Understand P you see 'cause he's sorta...
The best stuff on Earth
And if you come up with your bitch to put the cuff on first
'Cause I'ma animal pimp, I get up on a female
And tell her things she likes, she give me that tail
And I call heads, but I was all wrong dawg, a sex is the best
