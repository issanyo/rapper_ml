(These lyrics are far from perfect. I couldn't find them anywhere on the web, so I decided to write what I heard. Any suggestions are welcome)

Yeah, just found out though…
I’ll be right back, darling

[Verse 1 - Prodigy]

What’s up, gorgeous, beautiful
My sweet sister?
I spotted you, Out of thousands
From out the crowd
You were glowing in the dark
Your lights spark the most bright
Can we conversate? Rapper tastes
That’d be alright - Cool
My name is P and listen
I ain’t tryin’ a G
But you’re the most sexy
And plus, you always kill me
I saw you stressin
While I was going on the stage – rapping
But you got it twisted
Cause you’re the star of this show
Hey, let’s get away
Bounce to another place
Where we can have space to share drinks
What’s up ma what you think?
Let’s make it happen
Is it you about it?
Should I forget about it?
Should I forget about it, and end it now before I get shot down
See, Reply with those bedroom eyes, that I was the god
She was waiting for, for a very long time
I told I was bouncing in the morning at nine
Let’s take advantage of the moment, while we still have time
Spring colors got you looking like a piece of candy
Let me unwrap that and taste that
Just give me what you can’t get back

[Verse 2 - Prodigy]

Hey, sunshine, we both had a wonderful time
But you ain’t gotta stress, I see you when I’m back on the side
My friend’s got your girlfriends number
We keep in touch, love
Hey, don’t you hate it when girl loves?
She’s wanna be - more hugs and kisses?
I ain’t with it
I like a chick. When she only wants to did it
She get it
Then I say …
…
We like ‘em thick
We only love ‘em when they comin out they outfit, (?)
And love ‘em most when they swallow…
P that type that have a lady-cop take off a gun-belt
Work magic with a female
It’s only real, I’ll be fail
It’s hard not to
Cold hearted down’s got to
Melt down and show me proper
Cause when I speak it’s like pimp
When he built a stable
And when I boom boom I tranq them I turn them straight thun and leave them ... like how the earth's supposed to do P play the sun and how you heat it when I make moves
Cause I never sleep with it
I’m not your hubby
Fuck around
Close my eyes and wake up – with no money
Baby mothers keep throwing numbers at me
Told me to page her
I told them I call
…
She used to say “infamous”
Was her man’s favorite CD
Her daughter’s dad driving everywhere – bumping on me
Every third day on week
I knock his lady down to sleep
Climax it, sneaking out the room listening
It ain’t my fault
Take your pain out on your man
I’m only being myself
