What up, thunn?
Hold it down, son
Yeah, check it

[Verse one]
Yo
Anthem of the big barrels, handlers of huge flamethrowers
The most foul, throw in your towel
P-double, I'll blow a hole in your coupe bubble
Raised like a soldier, camouflage post-up
You shook when we slam or throw our guns in the air
Stop the party like Trafalgar Square
It's homicide music, when P put his words to it
Street journalist, block war inquisitor
Writer, for New York, novelist at gun talk
Chronicles of a young blood taught
To walk with his head up high
Eyes wide, wise guy, made man with Mob ties
Bolt-lock 9s, put one in a hole with no clip
Pocket full of bullets wilding, 16 handling shit
Through the dip, slip quick
I heard sirens coming from afar and slid
From the circumference, left a red splash then I dashed
Back in my lab, heart pounding from running fast
Put my half-assed gun back down in the stash
Twin got a four-pound for sale I need that
'Cause this no-clip shit could lead to my ass
Refuse to fall on my ass from any men's wrath, dollar's math
And thunn call me back real fast, yo
I ain't got no cash but I gotta smash
This no-frilled nigga came past, riding on pegs
Broke, nearly put one in his ribs
I barely got away with my head
Let me hold a fever on his strength
Probably catch him on the bench
Thunn said: “Use your head; this is it"
Back outside, put my hoodie strings down tight
Scene of the Crime, do or die
Seen Bobby, he cop me some coconut wine
Look across the street, I seen a dude walk by
He reaching, the chrome of his gun caught my eye
Push Bobby to the ground, move to the side
He pulled out, I pulled out at the same time
It felt like the end of Colors when we stopped and stared
I threw a pop first, the shot burst, we both was scared
He let his fear overpower his mind to think clear
That type of shit end your career, now lookie here
Squinted my lids, aimed for his face and missed
But I placed a few good in his back and wrist
He ran damned near crawling, I hit the house without stalling
Sweat pouring, trying to catch my breath falling
Check my body, to see if I caught one, or more some
Bum niggas wanna front for what? They lost one
Felt down the side of my forearm was wet
Aww shit, take the pain and bleed
Emergency'll call the D's
Grab the Codeine and swallow half the bottle
Get treatment out in Long Island, tomorrow

Dedicated to K.B. and Yambo, the Scarface Twin
To all my niggas that won’t think twice to sacrifice your precious life
Word up! My nighttime niggas, during the sun’s hour, keep your head up
Nigga, what? Word up!
My true-to-life thunns
Yeah…
