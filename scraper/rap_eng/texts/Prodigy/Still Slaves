Yeah, yeah
Uh huh
It's just another war story from a thirsty young hustler

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Yo, you could spend your whole lifetime hating on P
You can't stop my flow just watch how I eat
All the bacon, all the bread, all the cheese
Observe as I drop me another one of these
While you running your lips, I'm gunning the transmission
In some shit that's real expensive
While you're telling the world you point of view
The facts still remain, it's time for my crew
Yeah time for the dunn shine
Just look at how blind the over the truth
To set for your mind
Yeah the truth hurt don't it
Your origin is diseased, my origin is Godly
The Gods must be crazy, for leaving me to deal with this mess
All this pain and stress, fuck it they're paying me
These crackers, calling me on kinds of niggas for years
They wiped the Indians out, they're crying crocodile tears
Because...

[Hook]
We still slaves, we still slaves
I'm a slave for the dough, I'm a slave for the pay
They took the chain off our neck and put it on our brain
They took the chain off our wrists and put it on our brain
We still slaves, nigga we still slaves
I'm a slave for the dough, I'm a slave for the pay
They took the chain off our feet and put it on our brain
They took the chain off our wrists, put it on our brain

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
They've spent over a thousand years hating on P
But they couldn't stop me, I manifest destiny
Of the young black youth, and blacked out coupe
Niggas on their grind to buy a little food
We the kings of the Earth, God is a black woman
That nigga on that cross, I don't know him
But I know this, the size of our nose and our lips
Our ass, the titties, the dicks, our pretty black skin
Proves we superior
Really hate to brag but look what you did to us
That's why I'm iced out, the lifestyle
Of a million dollar menace, until they put my lights out
Nigga I put the kite out, fuck a war in Iraq
There's a war right here for soul power
And you don't even see it all in front of your face
Until them bodies tally, now you want to pray
We say, don't let Armageddon hit
We gotta get rich first, then you can blow this bitch
But when you really think on this shit
I'd rather have my soul than have all these riches...

[Hook]
We still slaves, we still slaves
I'm a slave for the dough, I'm a slave for the pay
They took the chain off our waist and put it on our brain
They took the chain off our neck and put it on our brain
We still slaves, nigga we still slaves
I'm a slave for that dough, I'm a slave for that pay
They took the chain off our feet and put it on our brain
They took the chain off our wrists and put it on our brains
