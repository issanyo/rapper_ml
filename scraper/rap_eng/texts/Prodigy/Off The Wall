[Verse 1: Boldy James]
Ain't nuthin promised to a nigga but the [clinic?]
And I came back, so I hit the [wit?] and took a drink
For my hitters in the bing and my critters in the grave
Higher than a motherfucker reminiscing in the days
On the times in the gutter, when my man went cluttered
I remember it like yesterday, that was the days
Now we live in a age, it's legal to own a gage
And killers is underaged, so you can't put your vest away
Cause ten years today, we was on haze
When my nigga got grazed from a stray when it ricochet
Went to his rib-cage and it struck a vein
As he bled out, the blood ran down the drain
As I ran out the house, see my nigga lay
Middle of the street, letter T, number seven [jays?]
Saw the look in his face, my face expression changed
He in a better place, so in his name i'ma

[Hook]
(Smoke) Gettin money
(Drink) Stay on the block
(Live) We punch [man?] on the time clock
(Smoke) [...?] on a scale
(Drink) Stayin outta jail
(Live) We livin' off the wall
No promise for tomorrow

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Yo look
I don't get along with these niggas, maybe something wrong with me
I trust none of these niggas, they all out to get me
I calculate my moves, before I step foot
Why would I trust you? I don't know you that good
But I never live like a scary nigga
I step to my demons, I don't hop for them niggas
When you get to know me, you learn I'm a wild boy
Ever since I was a kid, I knew my voice
Would be heard worldwide if I told my story
Cause everybody love a good underdog story
I was the runt nobody wanted
Little sick skinny puppy who the world disregarded
I wasn't supposed to live this long
But god showed a little favor it is a [...?] for the lord
And blessed me with the gift of pain
And that pain made me who I am today
That's why I smoke, drink, live, think very deeply
My philosophy today is
Fuck the world and don't ask me for shit
And anything you get you gotta work hard for it

[Hook]
