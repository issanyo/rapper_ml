[Produced by Havoc]

[Intro: Havoc]
No doubt!
Yo, yo, y'know how we did on The Infamous album, right?
Aight, we gonna do it again son

[Verse 1: Havoc]
Yo, laid up in the cut, watch these rap niggas fuck you up
Dig in shorty guts, get the bitch to set you up
It's the most trifle, 41st Side disciples
Take kindness for a weakness so I won't be so kind to
Niggas comin' through, I gave you birth kid, I'm sonnin' you
The Infamous got PC for days
We runnin' thru townships, fuckin' shit
Kid, we down shit
Hustle mad bricks, Queensbridge no doubt, rep the clique
9-6 droppin' wild on some Benz's
Some next shit, crash bar, ash the GOD
I remember when loadin' up the gats, beef settlin'
Ghetto peddling the Sonder, shorty dead again
Songs about 'We all around the NC'
Cop the E series, jealous ones envy
Hate to see me but got the nerve to wanna be me
I bleach blind em, you can't see like Ste-vie
I'm on TV, Vidbox and all that
Still in the Bridge, now what's fuckin' with that?

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
To all my Mobb crimey, money-hungry and grimy
Mobb sheisty, Godfather III and Gotti
Rapper Noyd, Ty Maxx and Ty Nitty
Scarface and Gambino, New York City
It's P live and direct, stab ya neck
Ice-pick bloodied up ya whole entire shit
Live shit 1-9-9-6, ask your bitch
My crew run wild, snatch chains and bracelets
Your time's wasted for figuring P
There's two sides of me
Snake niggas obviously, you get lumped somethin' horribly and then we calmly guzzle Spumantely and Dom PÃ©rignonly
Move the crowds over, cruise the fuck out
After GOD drinks had to shoot our fuckin way out
Spark flyin' niggas dyin', bitches cryin' and shout
Mobb niggas to the exit, we out

[Verse 3: Ty Nitty & (Gambino)]
(Ty) 9-6 load up the clips, the Infamous apocalypse
QBC on the L-I-E an sippin' Hennessey
And Remy, V-S-O-P, Ty Nitty jiggy
Eyes forever chinky, up in the Mariott
Tonnes o' hydro, black tuxedo, lay low
The 5-0-migos, the gigolo, what nigga?

[Verse 4: Twin Gambino]
My technique, official white meat
Internal bleeding he felt, heat then cold feet
QBC committee, Ty Nitty hit the safe
The Phillipino's have mad ice and gold plates
We escape, ain't no turnin' back to Stat
Pushin back-to-back acs, gettin' cheddar
Drug smugglin' tri-state, catchin' faith
We don't hesitate, we regulate and evaluate, cut the cake!

[Hook]
My crew worthy, blood sweat and tears
And thirty years for years, extort niggas and drink beers
Tired of livin' life this way, crime pay
But for how long till you reach a downfall
Thug niggas surround Y'all, 4-pound Y'all
Animal instinct, these niggas gettin' clapped on instinct
I'm tired of livin' life this way, crime pay
But for how long till you reach a downfall

My crew worthy, blood sweat and tears
And thirty years for years, extort niggas and drink beers
Tired of livin' life this way, crime pay
But for how long till you reach a downfall
Thug niggas surround Y'all, 4-pound Y'all
Animal instinct, these niggas gettin' clapped on instinct
I'm tired of livin' life this way, crime pay
But for how long till you reach a downfall

(Nigga) Motherfucker!
Word up!
