[Intro: Havoc]
You know what I'm sayin'?
I wanna say what's up to my man
Louie you know he's still here
Drop this one for you, you know
And for those who don't know
The 41st Side

[Verse 1: Havoc]
I keep it real, pack steel like my man YG
When a fool try to play me wet 'em up then I'm Swayze
You must be crazy, kid
Ran, I never did
Forever wildin' that's how we live up in the Bridge
You just sit scared
Cock back the Gat then hit a nigga like a bid
25, nah, kid you gettin' life
Forever burnin' in hell, niggas is trife
It's the, semi-auto, you can bring it on, yo
I'm pullin' out strippin' niggas just like a porno flick
I'm sick the Mobb rolls thick
Cross paths with my clique and get vic
I'm on some bullshit that's how I was raised, G
Each level is a stage
Have you slidin' down blades in pools of alcohol
Walk before you crawl
I'm in this to win this, you gonna take a fall
The Infamous Queensbridge, kid, we on the scene, kid
Creepin' on those who caught sleepin'
Don't ever do that I run with two macs
And plus my crew backs my every move
I choose givin' crews the blues
I'm open off the Dainy
Obey me or get sprayed with the sweeper
Cause I'm my brothers keeper
The Grim Reaper holdin' with nothin' but big batters
And big heaters
Blow you three times leave a mark like Adidas
Jig you, I know how to fix you
Pretty boy niggas frontin' hard is the issue
Word to my unborn you get scolded
Old and molded when I get bent you get folded
Every rhyme is the truth that I must get 'cross
Put you right on your back, take it to the source
No doubt I'm stuck and I can't get out
Of this lifestyle, the 41st side get bent, run wild
The 41st side, two
You know how we do, violate, motherfucker
I'ma see you, with the Linden
It's the start of your endin'
Settin' it again and again

[Interlude]
Yeah kid, its Big Time boy, 12th street representin' it
Big shout out to my man, Tear Gas, think, Lake whole crew kid
You knowhatI'msayin' couso? Richie Fraud known to leave ya scarred, give a big shoot out to my man Heavy L
Big Palms representing from the Goodfellas

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Yo, it's the P. E. double push a Lex bubble in the winter
You can't come along only the hoes can enter
Told her to meet me at six on the hill at the center
Took her to the west way and bent her right over
Stay intoxicated, never sober
Faced it, violate and get lace'd
Why you wasting slugs? You ain't buckin' nothing
You better off buckin' yourself: you need to stop fronting
I used to drive an Ac and kept a Mac in the engine
Littles painted it black with crack sale intentions
To blow up the whole projects the Infamous
Our sons will grow up to be murderers and terrorists
It's the nigga in me, accompanied by the cognac
You can ask around, don't fuck with the Mobb
I could've told you that, where you been at
You must have cut class
If it ain't me, another member of my crew will kick your ass (what what, what)
We do damage to limbs
In '91, stomping you out with black Timbs
Prodigy and the H.A.V.O.C. from the Q.B.C
Putting cowards where they're supposed to be
If I don't know your face then don't come close to me
I got too much beef for that
Drama in the 3rd degree
And to the kids you don't wanna be me
I'm up in the mix of action, where niggas wanna kill me
But it's the start of they ending, my man's lendin' me his Linden Forty-two shots depending
On whether or not the clip is full to the top
We busting caps non-stop, blazing
In all the shows and even at the hoes
(Nah, nah chill son)
What?

[Outro]
And it's the start of your ending
(word up yo, it's the start of niggas ending, youknowhatI'msayin?)
And it's the start of your motherfuckin' ending
(All y'all weak-ass crews that got drama with mines, you know what I'm sayin', It's the start of your ending, word up)
And it's the motherfuckin' start of the ending
(we know the fuck you is, you know what will happen)
(Recognize and realize)
41st side get bent, run wild
41st side get bent, run wild
The 41st side get bent, run wild
Word up you know what I'm sayin'?
