[Intro:]
Don't let 'em ever tell you dreams dont come true, Don't ever let them shoot down your dreams. No Dream big! Come here man, look me in my eyes now tell me who will stop me...

[Verse 1:]
Listen I can burn like the sun
Or be cool as the moon
Or depend how I feel at the time
And my mood could just flip like breezy
Or be easy like neyo was nothing Like a
Dub but something like a kilo if I want it I pursue it I don't Let up Till I have it like presto you can call me Mr. Magic
When I focus
My attention on the things I desire, those things get
Acquired no I
Never get tired I run the longest run and
I don't fatigue
What more
Then what
I need no this is not greed this is lust for the
Stuff that
I See I vision got this picture in my head that leaves with
Everything Listen
If it doesn't exist I bring it to existence difference between me and You is this you see obstacles
I see optical illusions I can not be Slowed down stoped or fooled with

[Hook:]
Anything that can be done
I can do it better
Anything is possible
I can do whatever
I chose life is what you make it
I chose my own path
Life is what you make of it

[Verse 2:]
Listen I believe I can fly on that G-650
Yeah I know I was born to live affluently
All this expensive shit is just grown folk toys
When your swamped with your money and
You get to enjoy it but the best part
About my life is all the people
Who tell me how much they love me
Yeah I love you too
Mobb Deep is for life P is forever
The infinite infamous man is like we never
Fall short, fall off fall Back theirs never been a
Team in the history Of rap with this Guinness Book of intelligent hard shiet only thing This game missing is more of
This mobb shieet your strippers dance on
Poles of them strip songs but In the car on the way home she puts on
That HNIC
Back to the real world
Back to reality

[Hook:]
