[Intro: Prodigy, Kool G Rap]
This the killa's shit, dun
No doubt, the undisputed

[Chorus: Prodigy, Kool G Rap]
For street niggas living with they lives on the line
For young guns coming up during these times
For police that find drugs let niggas slide
For niggas out slinging like 4 in the night
For your mans not snitching when the pressure is tight
For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night
This be the realest shit you heard in your life

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Yo, when the gats reveal you cats get peeled
And that's the deal
Fuck a bitch-ass that switch fast niggas that lack the real
When the slugs burst
G Rap be aiming at your mug first
Niggas is blood thirst, we'll see who get plugged worst
We dug earth, the place we put the nickel-plate is to your facial
Bullets ain't racial, kid, they only hate you
My nine'll seem like it's a time machine, B.C. date you
Jacking you more than Ripper
My fifth's an organ shifter, the human organism lifter
You'll be hearing organs if ya leaving orphans, if ya
Let these fours hit ya where the Lord split ya
I forbid ya..to bump heads with those that dump lead
Accurate shots in back of your knot
Leave you one dead, G Rap, Havoc and Prodigy
Let's put these bitch niggas
Where bodies be dun, yo if it gotta be, it gotta be

[Chorus: Prodigy, Kool G Rap]
For street niggas living with they lives on the line
For young guns coming up during these times
For police that find drugs let niggas slide
For niggas out slinging like 4 in the night
For your mans not snitching when the pressure is tight
For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night
This be the realest shit you heard in your life

[Verse 2: Havoc]
When the gat spit some niggas get blown off the atlas
It happens unsolved mystery re-enactments
Get practiced what you lack is you think like the average
Jake stoop down and leaving crime scenes entangled
Nothing but cannons get conspicuous
Like a man a little branded with the serial scratched
Bad apple out of the batch, dun they made me like that
If I could push back the clock probably leave it like that
Draw blood for my nigga G.O.D, Ty Nitty and Twin
And Twin is not here plus my kin
Killa B forever with me, quick to settle with me
Into QB to show love throughout the years with me
You got guns we got guns the serious ones
Leaving foul powder stuck in your lungs
We come from where niggas look out for they dun-duns
Love, never disrespect, hit niggas with re-direct

[Chorus: Prodigy, Kool G Rap]
For street niggas living with they lives on the line
For young guns coming up during these times
For police that find drugs let niggas slide
For niggas out slinging like 4 in the night
For your mans not snitching when the pressure is tight
For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night
This be the realest shit you heard in your life

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Never prejudge, it be the humble that squeeze slugs
It be the ones standing still that'll peel guns
Spill blood for my dunns thugging for me
Man you don't wanna get involved fucking with P
I spent more nights illing, less nights chilling
The more shots they hold the better they feel it
What be the deal is some killers like to hide behind specs
Others got blatant disrespecting and the rest
Or so young that you wouldn't even expect
To be bursting off guns like a Vietnam vet
On the steps, sitting in the staircase bent
Thinking on ways to take another man's head
Go to war with niggas that's against what I rep
I settle things with a heavy metal fifth
Change clips, switch clothes after I spit
Place niggas back in they space, fuck is on your mind kid

[Chorus: Prodigy, Kool G Rap]
For street niggas living with they lives on the line
For young guns coming up during these times
For police that find drugs let niggas slide
For niggas out slinging like 4 in the night
For your mans not snitching when the pressure is tight
For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night
This be the realest shit you heard in your life
