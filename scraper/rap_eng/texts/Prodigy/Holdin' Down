Niggas...shit right here niggas
Yall niggas back the fuck up
Straight up, big P right here
Head fucker in charge and shit
All these niggas man
New shit kid
J.S...this is how we do it
Yo...yo...

We so crazy
We shoot niggas right then and there if they try to play me
My whole attitude's like fuck everybody
I been through too much shit, y'all just hardly thug
My niggas got gnarly guns, that'll burst
And make it real hard to run
Cap'n P, you just a suspect soldier
My chain swing, yall niggas still rock chokers
We chest naked tattooed up
Wit two plastic cups
One got gin the other got punch
Yellow G-shock to match with my air force ones
Damn, my niggas got so much G, that's how we fuck
Damn, y'all niggas CD is so weak
I frisbee that shit, out the caddy truck
Nigga, we put out Mobb hits
It's the head nigga in charge, you lousy kid, what
(done)

Most people don't know
How far the soul go
Wit the real shit the ill shit
It's the P, nigga, with JS nigga
One love holdin down, hip-hop
Most people don't know
How far the soul go
Wit the real shit the ill shit
It's the P, nigga
We the realest niggas hold down, hip-hop

[Perry]
Yo...ya heard that shit?
Yo...I'ma let 'em know right here yo
These got me blasted
High on some melodic strung out raw mix that got 'em shafted
I saw 'em, throwin' some side ass shit
Like they wouldn't ride the dick if I gave it to 'em (bullshit)
Right here, right now, I'mma squash it
I'm about the sickest individual in the game who lost it
Out come platinum, I crossed it
Niggas had a road block on me givin till they saw the profit
Me, regular T boots and some camys
Livin' the life you couldn't even see in movies
It's just routine, every day scene status mad cream
Holdin' hip hop with the rest of my fam, see
I'm about a century deep and y'all minute muthafuckaz just pretending to be
Y'all keep it gently, I'mma proceed
To keep it rugged like it's supposed to be
Suckaz see me

Most people don't know
How far the soul go
Wit the real shit the ill shit
It's the P wit a 9 milli spitta
JS holdin down, hip-hop
Most people don't know
How far the soul go
Wit the real shit the ill shit
It's the P wit a YG trigga
JS holdin down, hip-hop

And the year is...
