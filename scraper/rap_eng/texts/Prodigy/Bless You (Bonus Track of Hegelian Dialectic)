[Intro]
Peace, what up dog?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
You know what it is man
Same shit ain't nothing changed
Out here getting it
Doing what I was supposed to be doing
Mind on my business, you know what I'm saying?
Gettin my money what up with you everything that good? Aight
Is that right?
Y'all niggas better go handle that then
Do what you gotta do man
Handle your things boy

[Verse 1]
May the good Lord bless you
With anything you hope or wish for bless you
May you live a long life
Make long money sleep good at night (I do)
I wish you nothing but the best
May you love real deep may you laugh real big (haa)
I pray your enemies fail
And you ain't never gotta spend time in jail (fuck that shit)
May you travel safe
And meet good people along the way
I hope you know you one of a kind
And you ain't gotta be like them you're just fine (you're alright)
I wanna see you become wealthy (uh huh)
And more important than that, stay healthy (stay healthy nigga)
God speed, and pray you never have to lock horns with P
(Oh hell no)

[Hook]
Peace be with me
The dark and the light angels protect me (yeah, that's right)
Life is about balance
You tryin to be cool but sometimes it gets violent (nigga)
Peace be with me
The dark and the light angels protect me
Life is about balance
I'd rather be cool, but out here it get violent

[Verse 2]
Out the shadows
Let the moonlight shine on me (who that?)
Keepers of the night, keepers of the Holy
Rapping words the spirit of the strong in me
I use the force, careful with that shit baby
I feel you I'm still learning my own strength
Sorry if wasn't perfect when you thought I should've been
I'm just a work in progress (yeah I know)
I encourage my self to be better and master the art, its
Long time coming seem like the other day
I'm just being myself, they callin me a late bloomer (what?)
And I don't know if that's a compliment or insult
And I don't give a fuck really keep talking
Got two pair of watch like the Polo kid
My time is so precious why would I waste it?
On a silly bitch like you and miss my chance
To realize my greatness and become who I am (beat it)

[Hook]
Peace be with me
The dark and the light angels protect me
Life is about balance
You tryin to be cool but sometimes it gets violent (peace)
Peace be with me
The dark and the light angels protect me
Life is about balance
I'd rather be cool, but out here it gets violent

[Outro]
As I take my gun off before I pray
I don't have problem with meeting God half way
Yeah, we believe in a higher force
May God be with you through this war
Shit real out here man, crazy out here man, peace

[Female voice]
You have just been exposed to a range of propaganda devices
Used by the West to control, manipulate, neutralize and anesthetize entire populations
It's own and that of other nations
