[Intro]
Yeah, uh, yeah give me that
Let me get that
I take all of that
Yeah, that's mines
And she's mines
And these mines
Uh, uh, yeah

[Chorus]
Alcohol, pills, smoke, we gettin' fucked up
Heaven is a dream, Hell is amongst us
Next level sex, fuck her pretty brains out
The lifestyle of a thug, we gettin' paid, loud
Alcohol, pills, smoke, we gettin' fucked up
Heaven is a dream, Hell is amongst us
Next level sex, fuck her pretty brains out
The lifestyle of a thug, we gettin' paid, loud

[Verse 1]
It's strange volume, my money is blastin'
My pockets turned up to the max, I'm flashin'
All types of fly shit in your face
These niggas can't stand it but murder be the case
Facts, you a flamingo, I'm a black vulture
Nigga, you puppy doo-doo, I'll King Kong shit on you
You can't rap, man, who the fuck signed you?
Like where they do that at? Like where the fuck did they find you?
I'll fine you, a couple pints of blood you paid me
Lucky you ain't lose your life, nigga, you should be thankin' me
For that piss bag I gave you is a gift
You're very fuckin' welcome, you ungrateful little bitch
I take a little swigger and take a little hit
MDMA and 'yak, that's that Henny remix
See, me bein' broke like you is forbidden
I get higher than star dust and look down on you, niggas

[Chorus]
Alcohol, pills, smoke, we gettin' fucked up
Heaven is a dream, Hell is amongst us
Next level sex, fuck her pretty brains out
The lifestyle of a thug, we gettin' paid, loud
Alcohol, pills, smoke, we gettin' fucked up
Heaven is a dream, Hell is amongst us
Next level sex, fuck her pretty brains out
The lifestyle of a thug, we gettin' paid, loud

[Verse 2]
If I could have anything, what would it be?
I take it all, scrap, I want everything
If I could have one thing, what would I choose?
I take the good life, you know that cash rules
Everything around me and two Glock 9's
Any motherfucker whisperin' about mines
I'll spank your behind with these copper-top cop killers
Niggas better run like the cops tryna get 'em
Live wire, I'm lit, finna to explode
Nigga violate my space, you better already know
I got cash motherfucker
I'm sittin' on a lot of stash, motherfucker
You dumb as a rock
I'm on the top, look me up, I'm so damn high
Should have wings on my back, I believe I can fly

[Interlude]
Yo, pass that son
Fuck that, let's get higher than this

[Chorus]
Alcohol, pills, smoke, we gettin' fucked up
Heaven is a dream, Hell is amongst us
Next level sex, fuck her pretty brains out
The lifestyle of a thug, we gettin' paid, loud
Alcohol, pills, smoke, we gettin' fucked up
Heaven is a dream, Hell is amongst us
Next level sex, fuck her pretty brains out
The lifestyle of a thug, we gettin' paid, loud
