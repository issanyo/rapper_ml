[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah Davis Absolute, Shook Ones challenge
Let's get into it, 100 bars for you guys
So 100 bars comes out to about 4 minutes but we gon' tear this track up
I got my fiancée Tanya on the camera doin' a great job so let's get into it
I'mma put the lyrics below, try to follow on if you can
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Found out there ain't such a thing as halfway crooks
Ski mask on the repass leave the madman shook
I spotted the problem with binoculars the false philanthropic
Cropped in a mirror image of the juggernaut industry inoculate
The foolish philosopher dipped fingertips into the pot of profit
Pinching the dollar like a blunt no regard for consequence
While they peel on the driver side, tinted windows down
Trying to kill what I proclaim is mine, I’m ten toes down
Looking to create value only to find their imagination
A golden calf committed to their supreme validation
They surround it, hands down, they found it
Praise it and crown it, man down
And we say that out loud that God’s allows it
What’s the root of all evil, I found it
A dead face with a subtle grin, placed above the blood of men
Even the demons covet what we’re covered in
The blood of the Son of Him, soon to come down once again, I see them running
A millennium meddled memories and a faded evergreen past
A millennial spitting melodies exceptional craft
Infinite figure eights define figurative math
Rags to riches, section 8 to product opulence and Prada bags
Illusion spotted from the top of the hour glass
Yet these sands of time could never wash these hands of mine
Obsession with greed, the seed spread like the gust of a dandelion
A lie is undefined when damned men decide
The rocks cry, blood rise likened to the Omaha tide
Plucked wings could fly high as G5 instead we comply
With the all seeing eye, been deceived so we deny
That we bleed the same, the beauty disguised to be vile
Depending on the elixir that you sipping from the vial
I see the angel pouring out the goblet, the end is now
So surrender or be taken, fall asleep or be awakened
Dormant or shaken, the whore reigns but the world is for the Lord’s taking
I was mislead, no I mean I’ve been missed with lead
The enemy spitting darts from his pistol, clip hit my leg
I bled into the mud, hit the ground I’m good as dead
A shook one left in the mega city to the Judge
Dred filled my head, reminded of the God that saves me
How the Earth quakes when placed face to face with the Creator
See great men tremble, see Kanye West
Fall to the feet of King, we all surrender in death
The unjust seem beautiful wickedness hidden inside
Never discuss proof, corrupting the youth create truth that’s vilified
Those are the same some share a square root, X marks the signs of the times
Point blank you get the same total
When the deceit is multiplied
But it seems they want to ride, in the beamer of the lies
Kick they feet up and recline
And find the rest in peace, fall asleep live to die
Sequence of a dreamer never to achieve feats of the idolized
With a wallet full of everything proclaimed to be knowledge
Contrived on the basis that this money is power
Spent, thrown, rolled up and filled with powder
The absolute, the golden hand, beneath it nations cower
Uh - but the camel can pass through the eye of a needle
In the same breath I can disprove that the paper is evil
What that gold coin ever do for you?
Who did it rob, who did it kill, who did it shoot
When did obsession harbored in adolescence
Made that coin come for you, I await your confession
Like Adam eating the fruit
Hiding hoping to dodge a lecture
Ironic how he was passing the buck, sideways passive aggressive, same moment tragedy struck
I see the fall of man you see the hand you were dealt and I see the glove fitted from His love
Believe me when I say it that I’ve been like you
Day to day it’s still the same I often sin like you
Laugh, cry, love my family my friends like you
In many ways I might even live like you
But the difference is you see things how you think they look
I see them through the eyes of God, now tell me who’s shook
With a goal to cling to the Vine knowing that I am just a leaf
No - Cling to DIVINE - observe sprouts of the fig tree
Six feet laying in the coffin of the mincemeat
Waiting, the chase for the piece of the pie was tempting
Eternity waits for those who pull away the guise, and yet we
Repeat the same thing fighting the same thing we against, we
Losing our mind it’s time to realign with what the King speak
Losing our minds it’s time to realign with what the King speak
Shook ones
Shook ones
Scared to death scared to look
I’m shook
There ain't no thing as halfway crooks
Scared to death scared to look
I’m shook
There ain't no things as halfway crooks

[Outro]

Check it out, share it, let somebody know
God is good, God is real, and He wants you back in His life
Accept His offering
He sent His Son to die for you
That's no lie
Amen
