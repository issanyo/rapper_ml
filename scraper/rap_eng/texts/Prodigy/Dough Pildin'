[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Listen, don’t talk to me about songs cuz i embarrass you
24-carat gold plaques in my living room
Same karat the watch, know the fucking time
I wrap circles around niggas, on my grind
I draw circles around these roaches with the chalk
Get your body outlined in the Streets of New York
By the King from Queens and he via Long Island
Hempstead two to your head, you stop wildin’
Look at me now, I’m growned up
I turned out to be a Legend in my own time
They say, General Bars. He stalks through the night
You can hear him in the ghetto, where it’s dark cuz the light’s all
Shot out, shout out to niggas, put the pot out
When they see the boys coming from Deep, it’s getting hot out
We hit the hideout couple hours and we back
Too much money out here to be anything less than paid

[Chorus: Prodigy]
You know me, I keep the dough pildin’
Nice and neat, low key, I’m lounging
We turned up in the Street you get found in
Same spot you was tryna wild out in

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Big Hammer to waist, that's how I gotta move
If it ain’t the three-fifty, it’s a knife or a tool
For niggas thinking they smooth, what I’m supposed to do?
I attack motherfuckers who stunt, it’s not cool
Kids, don’t try this at home, it’s nothin’ to play with
Enjoy your young life, don’t fuck with them gauges
Cuz these shits blow off tops, destroy families
See, niggas get shot ayday, B, it’s mandy
Don’t fuck with plated numbers, ever play me
Get your money, my pockets is real cakey
My life is real crazy
But I wouldn’t trade it, na, you couldn’t make me
Get this paper up, it’s the only way
We gon’ eat food, have a place to stay
You tell me “How the fuck is you gon’ make it?!”
If you starve, then you’re cold and your ass is butt-naked
You see

[Chorus: Prodigy]
You know me, I keep the dough pildin’
Nice and neat, low key, I’m lounging
We turned up in the Street you get found in
Same spot you was tryna wild out in
