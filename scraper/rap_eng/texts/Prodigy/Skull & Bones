[Verse 1:]
I am not what you thought, I am all seeing
I am the top of New York
This is Empire State boss shit
I endorse violence in the worst form
Bring it on, I implore
I am more than your worst nightmare
I am the Devil
On my level you could never be jeez
I am God, I am perplexin
Mind boggling hard, I am P, Infamous Mobb Deep
And who are yall? Who are you? Nobody
What are we? Everything
Every rapper in the hip hop game wish to be
R.I.P. , grand wizard of the sixteens
That bust like elephant guns
And blow up magazines
I shine, Illuminate, yeah my aura is awesome
Illuminati is us, we are the origin
Of all enlightenment
These pirates stole our shit
So now you know
Skulls and bones

[Hook:]
Scalpel, scalp you
Skin the pussy alive
All they find is you
Skull & Bones (Repeat 4x)
Red box cutter
I will box cut ya
Do you like... all they find is your
Skull & Bones (Repeat 4x)

[Verse 2:]
I am not what you assume
I am a fucking terror
When you ever make a move
I am angel dust smoke
Please light up my fuse
These niggas is pussy, word to mommy I would do
Niggas filthy, I am really the things that I rap
You just a custee, trust me
You won't want that
I am Ron Artest, Jermaine O'Neal
Fuck a fan up bloody, all they gon' do is tell
I be all knowing, you niggas structures ain't built
You's a gang of glass joes, I will shatter and kill
R.I.P. , grand wizard of the sixteens
That spit like 40 sevens and 50 cal's
I bang, I shine, illuminate
Yeah my aura is awesome
Illuminati is us, we are the origin
Of all enlightenment
These pirates stole our shit
So now you know
Skulls and bones

[Hook:]
