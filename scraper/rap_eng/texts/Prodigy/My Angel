Oh, baby I'm talking to you
U-u-uh, yeah
I would buy anything you sell, follow you to hell
You got me actin' over in myself
Don't drop me, cause I'm in the palm of your hand
My boys laughed at me, I don't even care
How may it sound
I'm just being real, well
I'ma speak from the heart
I'ma be sincere
You seem to be the type I could love for life
I'm tryna found out for myself
See if I'm right baby
You're killin em close
You'd be dressing your ass off
Hair and your nails looking fresh from salon
You ain't got to be on TV or magazines
From my POV (point of view), you're a star to me
Can I, may I get your autograph
Or perhaps you could put your number under your name
And give the young man a chance to prove you
Worth a young woman such as yourself
If I'm deserved it?

Oh, girl
Aren't you the baby I can't get enough of?
You my angel, yeah
Thug angel!
Oh girl, oh
I can't get enough of you
Come here baby (I need you), yeah
Thug angel!

There goes my baby, my lady, my heart beat
She the blur circulating
Do my thing, she the torch in my brain
It go lavish trap for so long to obtain
'Cause yo dope, she mine
If I want her kit, got to treat her everyday as if
We just met, and she treat me the same
Smile on her face when I walk
Inside the room, nothing else matters
Everyday silouhettes, the only living colors
Is me and my bitch
Come here, give me kiss and your real hug too
They jealous, they tell us to get a room
But everyways I'm loveless, and I swear
We could make love right here
Get my soft candy, I unwrap you
And then pop it in, the flavour everlasting

Oh, girl
Aren't you the baby I can't get enough of?
You my angel, yeah
Thug angel!
Oh girl, oh
Come here
I can't get enough of you
Come here baby (I need you), yeah
Thug angel!

My baby like a simple bass, to give her happiness
She not into all of that, she ain't into all of this
I think we found the rest
And growing all together is in our future
Love chow, waw, orgy, gorgeous
Flawless
She's all that I'm wanting when I'm boring
To my thugs, when we hang out in the clubs
Cause I turned down all thet upper brothers
But, to her I'm the best thing
Since sex is been here
She cry when I'm in it, 'cause
It feels so good, like ball beauty
I doubt that you ever found another like mine
And I'll never ours
So if we split, then we both had a loss
Your my soft candy , I unwrap you
And then pop it in, the flavour long lasting

Oh, girl
Aren't you the baby I can't get enough of?
You my angel, yeah
Thug angel!
Oh girl, oh
Come here
I can't get enough of you
Come here baby (I need you), yeah
Thug angel!
