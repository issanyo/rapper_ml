[Chorus:]
Baby I love you
Why you did me so wrong
Why why why why
She couldn't nothing gone me
Baby just let me explain
I'ma give that bitch
I'ma smack that chick
I don't play that chick

[Verse 1: Esther]
You used to love me, you used to touch me
Take me out every night
Love kissing meall night all night
I don't deserve all this speed
I'm so tired of crying
You're just a player you're just a liar
A cheater, you're a cheater ohh
I give you my eyes, I give you my soul
I give everything to you
Oh cheating

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
The clutch the heart
Better rush my cold blood
Probably do my benz you can see it in my face
That I'm not the burb unless you were
Only God no would occur
Baby I'm not here getting paid is not a game
I'm not afraid, I meditateon bodies
Getting all this fast dope
Dead nigga come try me
And end it feel it with this cash flow
I got this strage in me they playin games with me
I spit up on their hoodies lead their brains drippie
This that hood love, that good love
Real shit I spill blood
Phone flash in tears is the way I grew up
Baby you got an evil angel for a soul mate
May we couldn't leave each other
And we lose all our strength
Pray god that we never fall apart
Cause our love baby it was written in the stars
Let's take that little flacture light
That go to Mars
Or we could chill on the block
Drinking play bars

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
You speak the shit though
I ain't got that time for nobimbos
I got one bitch in my life and
She all that I live for
Get my blood, get my flash, get my soul
Do you real quick, I don't drink behind your back
I ain't with that D shit
I gotta beat it lucky and snuggy on planet earth
I got the hottest bitch alive that's swerve
To everything sacred you priceless my precious
I just needed to know before I gave you access
That everything is a 100 percent
I was just playing with that girl
You the one that I'm bad
All night the shape over
Pissy drunk over you
Nice flipping on me feeling like a hangover
I ain't got to lie to you
Got nothign to hide
You the only one I ever felt this way in my life
Now now we too good for this bullshit
And we too fly to be crying
Cry pretty eyes death we defy


[Chorus]
