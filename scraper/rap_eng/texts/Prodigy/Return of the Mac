[Hook] {2Pac sample}

{"And all my niggas in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nothin' separatin' us from a MAC-10"} - 2Pac

I got eleven MAC-11's, thirty-eight .38's
Nine 9's, ten MAC-10's, this shit don't end

{"And all my niggas in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nothin' separatin' us from a MAC-10"}

I got eleven MAC-11's, thirty-eight .38's
Nine 9's, ten MAC-10's, this shit never ends

[Verse 1 - Prodigy]
I'm on my New York shit
Mobb Deep nigga, Queens, New York shit
Orange boxcutter, that New York shit
Guzzle the whole bottle, that's a New York sip
My baby mom's from Brooklyn, my New York bitch
Got that coke on Broadway, that New York flip
Hoes down South love my New York accent
And cheat on they man, from some New York dick
Niggas get mad, I pop in the clip
And pop for they symbol on they New York fit
With a rusty gun, but the shit still spit
Rubber bands on the handle: The New York grip

[Verse 2 - Prodigy]
Get on my New York shit
And show these mo'fuckers what New York is
Twelve homicides in a New York minute
Take a trip up top, for a New York visit
N.Y.P.D. - New York Pricks an' Dicks
Heard ya workin' with the D's, you a New York snitch
I'm tryin'a make a hundred mil', that's New York rich
Back an' forth to Philly with these New York bricks
Niggas get jealous over New York quick
Ay ho, wanna know, who the New York kid?
With the New York plates, on the bulletproof truck
Better chill or get killed by a New Yorker

{"Ain't nothin'...}

Let these niggas have it, son

{"Ain't nothin' separatin' us from a MAC-10"}

Alchemist, man
You know what it is, man
