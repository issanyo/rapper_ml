[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Out of touch niggas wanna shit my name
They lost touch with reality long before 2013
Look at me, i'm flyer than a bitch
And your hoe know, she respects my motherfucking dick
Young Alien told me: ''style on em P''
Then he passed me the chee, Alchemist threw on the beat
Let me tell you niggas something dope
Something you can bring it back like the cypher smoke
Gangsta hippie, i'm really on some cool shit
But you try to press me, I don't bullshit
It's gonna be bad, it's not gonna be fair
The fuck you take me for, some type of square?
Look I'm well aware that we are not the same
Polar oposites, I'm active, you a lame
I'm bout it, you ain't, nah, you ain't ready to ride, and hunt human beings
You're not a gambling man, you wouldn't risk your freedom


[Hook: Prodigy]
Say my name three times in the dark
I'll pop up in your bedroom, pop in on your broad
Say my name hoe, don't try to hold it in
R.I.P., he colder than the cold wind


[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Cut him like the Hulk
He bleeding like Jack Frost
My heart been a ice box since I could walk
All I know is pain, don't get me started bro
You know i'm dead serious you niggas living jokes
I get ghost, long before I hit folks
So I'll be out in Sweden, while you be here wheezing
Blood bubbleing from your nose, hard to breathe with
Bullets in your lungs and statements in your mouth
I be doing niggas favors, exposing rats
And goddamn, this the motherfucking thanks I get?
Sensitive thugs, y'all all need slugs
Lodged in your spinal columns, Roll you like drugs, And persian rugs
I won't even take your money or that rollie on your cuff
I stick to the script, and incinerate rubbish
Militant, I don't tolerate a lot of dumb shit


[Hook]
