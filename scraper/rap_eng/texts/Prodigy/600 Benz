I like that, I like that

Man I'm big time
Yeah it's big P
Dollar after dolar, M
Money growing like a tree
Better yet a forest
P got the retardest
Maniac rapper from New York
With the hardest
Endless, 16 bars or 12 bars
I rap about my life not about yours
You might though, you wish....

Check me out dun...

[Hook]
I just wanna CL 600 Benz
20 inch rims, looking real fresh
The Ferrari got manual on automatic switch but (See them 20's spinning)
CL 600 Benz
20 inch rims
Lookin' real fresh
Turbo Porsche with the 6 speed shift but (See them 20's spinning)

I stop at the light
Everybody stares
Hand on my gun
You don't see it but it's there
Think it's all a game
Think it's a mirage
Get that ass lit
Like fire on the logs
I got endless drama
Young boy you a flee
I step on ya head
When I step out the V

[Hook]

CL 600 Mercedes Benz
20 inch rims
Stuntin' on my lady friends
Shorty kick it back
And enjoy the trip
We goin' on a ride
Fly in the whips
Chrome dubs
With the jet black lips
Lil' kids see it and call it the 'spaceship'
David on my neck, Gaibel gave my this
But (See them 20's spinning)

[Hook]
