Too young! (4X)

[Verse One - Rap]
As time passes, I flow with the swiftness G
Showin you all that are with this
Continous flavor, you all wanna savor
And those without no clout will have to pay for this
DOPENESS, you ask who wrote this
(?? ??) and I do quote this
Rappers evaporate, flakes we eliminate
Create the great then I wait as I meditate
For those, who can't keep up with the dope rhyme
Huh, I waste no time
(??) they will come to return the life of some
So for now, I guess we're just too young

[Verse Two - Singing]
Go to school to listen to the teachers all day
To learn about the history of the U. S. of A
I'd like to make a difference, starting today
But I'm not eighteen - Uncle Sam says, "No way!"
All them rules are dying in the, worst way
We're getting (??) (??) working late
I wanna save the planet, before it's too late
But the E.P.A. won't listen to what I have to say
Grown folks are talking, but never wanna listen
My head is spinning as I try to get attention
They tell me don't worry, there's just nothing that I'm missing
When will they ever - as for my appearance, I'm too young
.. to make my own decisions, too young
.. to choose my own religion, I'm too young
.. to have my own opinion, too young
I'm too young

[Verse Three - Singing]
My daddy goes to work, almost ev-ery-day
He has to nine-to-five it so there's food on the plate
The boss is cutting corners and it shows on his face
And that's why, he'll reply - "You're too young son, go out and play"
The city's filled with people with no, place to stay
Kids are pushing drugs to find a, better way
Babies having babies, and throwing them away
All because their parents, couldn't give them the time of day
Grown folks are talking, but never wanna listen
My head is spinning as I try to get attention
They tell me don't worry, there's just nothing that I'm missing
When will they ever - as for my appearance, I'm too young
.. to make my own decisions, too young
.. to choose my own religion, I'm too young
.. to have my own opinion, too young
I'm too young

[Verse Four - Rap]
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Yo, I'm too young, to even try to get my point across
So why should I try, when I just feel
Their eyes of deception, no need for correction
Just cause I'm underage there's no election
Chillll, I'm not with that program
My reading level's not "Sam I Am"
I am a pro, and my brain is objective
So here my son, take some notes corrective
Adults only, is what they told me
So for some, huh, I guess I'm just too young
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

[Verse Five - Singing]
All them rules are dying in the, worst way
We're getting (??) (??) working late
I wanna save the planet, before it's too late
But the E.P.A. won't listen to what I have to say
Grown folks are talking, but never wanna listen
My head is spinning as I try to get attention
They tell me don't worry, there's just nothing that I'm missing
When will they ever - as for my appearance, I'm too young
.. to make my own decisions, too young
.. to choose my own religion, I'm too young
.. to have my own opinion, too young
I'm too young
