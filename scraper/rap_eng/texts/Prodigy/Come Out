[Movie Bites from "Belly (1998) ", Louie Rankin as Lennox speaks:]
(COME ONE!) You wanna bumbablot me?
You don't know me...
I'm the original Jamaican dandatta!
Who want test me? Come here, you maggots!
You wanna romp with bumbaclot me?!
Come on, come on!
I murder people for fun!
You wanna ramp with bumbaclot me?!

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
Y'all niggas wanna rump with me not me
I'm not a rude boy I'm a Haitian gangsta
Y'all niggas wanna rump with me not me
I roll with 80 shooters and they all is gangsta
Jealous ones envy money cause greed
44 colt put ya dick on ya sleeve
While 50 lift weights, tony lift toast
Pull it out rappers turn into Cinnamon toast
Cowards, spin on my rope, chillin' on boats
Put the "d" in the blender start blending the dope
Yo I'm raw like that coke in a liquid form
In the club with my starp till the liquors gone
Yo that friendly extortion turns into blood money
I could buy my own army with that Pablo es money
Glock auto matie yo, bitch gotta fatty yo
For 14 bricks Pablo killed Fabio
Cop 5 acres, the pool and the patio
My flow is speradical, whites think it's radical
I spit 16 like a sawed of calico
It's T-O-N-Y my flow is phenomenal

[Hook: Tony Yayo]
You can run but you can't hide nigggggaaa
Come out, come out, wherever you are
Pop shit with my pistol bigggerr
Come out, come out, wherever you are
You could run outta town put tints on your car
Come out, come out, wherever you are
Have a vest on your chest I murder you par
Come out, come out, wherever you are
Come out, come out, wherever you are
Come out, come out, wherever you are

[Verse 2: Nyce Da Future]
I see y'all in ya cars show me what the signs bout
After you do that I shoot you with the 9 spout
Pull the 9 out, pull your spines out
Holes in your car it could be hard to climb out
Me and Yayo spin through, the city with them guns
These ar 15's playin' Frisbee with ya lungs
Me and p nigga, gettin' busy with them guns
Me and 50 get it for 5 for 50 in the slums
So nigga act up these shotties attached to our legs
The infared beam attached to your head
We act like mones, homie we attach the bread
These cowards work for the government attached to the feds
So come out, come out, wherever you are
Or the guns, the guns, coming outta that car
Once the bullets outta the chamber, straight up danger
Nigga bodies all nice like the new york rangers

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
I know alot of niggas is jealous, alot of niggas is greedy
And lotayou niggas concentratin' on me so much
I can feel ya vibrations
Man I'm all the way in England with a tingling sensation
In my thoughts somethings telling me to set it off
Just in case you try to front later on
I said, somethings telling me to come shoot ya
Just in case that you front in the future
So I nipped that in the bud, get back in the truck
With the 3 inch glass, shoot that if you want
Don't turn up the music that's Tony Cocaine
And PCP yea that G-Unit gang
Got a young gun named Nyce that's ready to pop
And when the shit gets thick you need 40 Glock
I told niggas don't paly with me but you don't listen
Till wap squeeze the wap and you get chunks tooken of your arms
And your skull when them things pull
The cops gon get low them shots coming through
In your arms and your skull, when them things pull
The cops gon get low them shots coming through

[Hook]
