Yeah
It go; 1, 2, 3, to the 4
That nigga P double got that shit fo'sho
5, 6, 7, to the 8
You niggas make me laugh straight to the bank
You niggas got problems with me?
Can't wait till we're in the same room in the same place
You just dropped the brick get outta my face
Your album sound like shit, fucking disgrace
To the whole black race, rap race
Stop wasting budgets; buy your self a place
My song will embarrass you, you're in the wrong game
I'll make you look stupid, sound real lame
Compare to this sixteen bars of pain
When I write I get tight, I'll be ready to bang
Cause in real life out in the world it get worst
I'll brace car, buy guns, and bang for your shirt

(Chorus) Prodigy
There's gon' be some shit when I see you
Goodfella nigga but I'm 'fenna get evil
Up, put 'em when his pants was down
Look, now I got 'em running on camera now
There's gon' be some shit at this party
Everybody leaving except for one body
Got his self killed over that Bacardi
We handle the shit then its back to the party

[Prodigy]
Ayo, dunn take the blunt while I fuck this nigga up
Keep burning our flag and he fronting like he tough
Niggas comin home from jail like they 'sposed to have me
Under some type of pressure, go fuck your mother
You really wanna step to me?
Get online and go around the block, who next to get live?
On P-TV, better not have step
Cause everybody watching they all gon' witness
My power and strength, they see it's not a toy
You're trying to pet a Lion, I'mma enjoy me an arm for dinner
May God forbid I, get a whole of the rest of you I'll be a sinner
And thou shall not kill, unless they trying to kill me
And then shall finger pop the Uzi
Now the bitch's all wet, bitch ass nigga, I'll make 'em fall back
When I hit 'em in his titties, catch 'em in the city
Doing real dirty cause his face real pretty
Niggas bleed more when they're drunk off the Henney
You fucked up my shirt, mad DNA

(Chorus) Prodigy
