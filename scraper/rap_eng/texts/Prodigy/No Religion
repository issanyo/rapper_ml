Yeah that's right!

[Verse 1]
My raps scare the fuck outta people, but I'm just misunderstood
But if you were to listen real good
Then you wouldn't mistake me for being crazy
You would learn to love and appreciate me
Now! hear me clearly
The reason I am how the I am, they don't scare me
I'm not under the spell, I'm not trapped in the cycle
They can't pull the wool
Over my eyes, I see the truth
For all of our lives, we've been lied to
And I know, it's hard to accept
So we drink away the pain and party to death
Have so much sex, smoke so much weed
We just wanna have fun, we don't wanna think
We just wanna make dollars, we don't wanna make sense
We don't wanna pay attention, we just wanna pay the rent

[Hook]
Young niggas that blast for me, no religion
Young niggas that blast for me, no religion
Young niggas that blast for me, no religion
Young niggas that blast for me, no religion

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna hear about your spiritual eiphannies G's
I'm not a role model, I just care about what make me
More money and celebrity power
More sex, drugs and fame, a star for my fame
On that L.A. sidewalk, that's how you want me to be ain't it?
'Cause when I do good you hate it
Bit when I'm evil and reckless you love it
Fanatics, y'all a bunch a sick motherfuckers
You need to grow up and open your minds
I put truth in the song, but you want lies
I put real in rap music, but you want fake
By the time you understand me it'll be too late
You're so caught up in fantasy land, you're so under the spell
I wish you luck, I wish you well
Real men drink water
We stay with our women, and raise our daughters
And our little men too
And teach them the things they won't teach 'em in school
Like ancient Black history and how to survive in these modern times
It's no games being played, no kiddin' no bullshittin' and
It's no games being played, no kiddin' no bullshittin' and
No religion

[Hook]
Young niggas that blast for me, no religion
Young niggas that blast for me, no religion
Young niggas that blast for me, no religion
Young niggas that blast for me, no religion
Ooh rev ain't right
Young niggas that blast for me, no religion
Young niggas that blast for me, no religion
