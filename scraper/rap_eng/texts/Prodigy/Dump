[Intro]
Yeah, come on man (Dump dump dump)
You know this shit is ours man, this is our field man (Dump dump dump)
Y'all niggas need to just leave this shit to us (Dump dump dump)
Corny-ass niggas (Dump dump dump)

[Verse 1: Havoc]
Ayo, that's that hard shit
That hit a nigga up in his car shit, this war bitch
Somehow I feel we need more of the thing
Instinct to get that paper, know it's all in my vein
You rookies need to be toilet trained
You faggots shitting everywhere that you eating, that's why the coroner came
You never know, when the tec'll blow
Wet you and catch you off guard, niggas know that I crept slow
And never fold bitch, hollows we let 'em go
And hope them little jugs you sold cover your medical
Y'all don't wanna bump heads with us
Dump lead head to head with us (Nah)
And ain't no leg-in homie, neck and up
It come to beef, you know we cheffing it up (All day baby)
And ain't nobody do it better than us
Dry snitch and we wetting you up (Dump dump dump)

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Many men try to set me up to watch me die
Tie me up and put me in the trunk then wave bye-bye (Dump dump dump)
Everyone who know me know that I'm Mobb Deep and I
Keep it true and ain't afraid to shoot so duck when I (Dump dump dump)
Ain't gon' catch me slipping up
Ain't gon' catch me give it up (Dump dump dump)
Ain't gon' hear me creeping up
Roll down the window I'm about to (Dump dump dump)

[Prodigy]
Nigga I'll smack that smirk right off your face
You listen to jerk music, this is Mobb Deep
You ain't never seen or heard no shit like this
Until you purchase our CD, it's very worth it
Don't confuse our album with that mixtape shit
Those our scratch, basically our throwaway shit
And nobody wrap the street like the Infamous clique
Slash Jive, now we got millions to work with
And we Violators too, so you know we overdoing it
What's stopping the crew, only death can ruin it (Bring it)
Homey been there and done that, and still they wanna come back
And shoot us down (Blaow blaow blaow)
Our advice, you want somethin done right
Then you better come and do it yourself
We give shooters this shits, make OG's get they gun off the shelf
And blow the dust off they old snub-nose three pound (Dump dump dump)

[Hook]

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
Shoot 'em up now bang-bang
Don't fuck around with the wrong mayne
In every fucking city, it's the same thang
Don't be saying nothing stupid to a grown mayne
Shoot 'em up now bang-bang
It really ain't the same, now the game changed
Got me gripping on my weapon just to main-tain
Fill you full of holes and get my name changed

[Hook]
