[Intro]
You know how we can purchase a couple of TEC-9, semi-automatics, extended magazines?

Hold on, who? TEC-9's? The fuck for?

It's a family problem

[Hook: Conway]
Give them niggas the drum
Roll down the Benz window let off twenty-one
Young and dropping bodies like it's fun
Fifty on his head, his own shooters get it done

[Verse 1: Conway]
Pyrex pot, got the yola resi'
Shoot a fifteen with the sweeper hold it steady
James Patterson with the pen, I'm writing thrillers
I write it for killers, they treat my words like Bible scriptures
Had the youngin fire the blicka
Tryna peel the cap for that contract he never seen that type of scrilla
I ain't like these weirdo rappers, I'm a psycho nigga
Grimy like Tyson in the ninetie nigga, you Bryson Tiller
Homie that's on dogs i never liked you niggas
Hit you with some shit outta this automatic rifle nigga
Praise me, I'm like christ to niggas
Them large niggas was blind i dropped the shit and gave sight to niggas
Load the M-16 rocking Supreme
Nowadays they don't make diss songs, they making memes
Till i find them and run down on and 'em and let it ring
Bitch there ain't a rapper alive fucking with the machine

[Hook: Conway]
Give them niggas the drum
Roll down the Benz window let off twenty-one
Young and dropping bodies like it's fun
Fifty on his head, his own shooters"ll get it done

Roll down the Benz window let off twenty-one
Fifty on his head, his own shooters get it done

[Verse 2: Conway]
The shooter squeezing, he a heathen when he snort
M-16 reaching leave you bleeding on your porch
Look you keep running your dicksuckers that's the reason you a corpse
