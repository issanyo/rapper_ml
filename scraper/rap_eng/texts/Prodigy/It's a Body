[Hook: Prodigy]

I got a whole lot of soldier, you don't want to move on me
You just want to talk, because soon as move on me
It's a body, it's a body, it's a body, we're gone'
Catch a body, catch a body, catch a body
I got a whole lot of soldier, you could never move on me
All you do is talk, because soon as you move on me
It's a body, it's a body, it's a body, we're gone'
Catch a body, catch a body, catch a body

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Look you should know, my mott and mo
Niggas heads will roll, my gun explode
My niggas roll, Mobb Deep and yo
Get locked, the door, get extra blown
Young rolling stoners, I'm on that lean
No not that drink, I'm popping P's
I'm popping pain, get out my lane
It's not your speed, it's not your thang
It's only for the criminals, who put you up in critical
I feel sorry for your mama, your family will be missing you
You mental, I will turn your physical into spiritual
Knock you out and then piss on you
Worldstar that, I get you views
You want to be known, I make you famous
Beat your ass up the block butt naked
Nigga you're not nothing like you're claiming
Nigga you pop up on me, get wasted
Please, try that with me get basted
Bloody urine, you're marinating
Your lame ass life you have forsaken
Say hello to Satan

[Hook: Prodigy]

I got a whole lot of soldier, you don't want to move on me
You just want to talk, because soon as move on me
It's a body, it's a body, it's a body, we're gone'
Catch a body, catch a body, catch a body
I got a whole lot of soldier, you could never move on me
All you do is talk, because soon as you move on me
It's a body, it's a body, it's a body, we're gone'
Catch a body, catch a body, catch a body

[Verse 2: Boogz Boogetz]
Yappy with the talk, that's what niggas be good at
One I pop the trunk, leave a hater right where he stood at
Codeine up in my cup, all they do is catch stunts
Fuck on any bitch that I want, that whole Cali up in my blunt
And my pockets cheesy like Calzones
Money stretch like a mile long, bitch I'm getting my style on
We got bricks, brown stone
Hater I stay away from around those
Only fuck with them down hoes
Peep my views and my down lows
If you ain't talking money, dial tone
Infamous until I rest, let a woman let it click
Said I move too fast, I be in another chick
And I blow up in a O let me hit another zip
Post up on the block and I kill another shrimp
Looking out for the cops let me hit another lick
You be fronting, you be stunting in another nigga whip
Haters say goodbye, bet that eight will fly
You niggas sweet, potato pie

[Hook: Prodigy]

I got a whole lot of soldier, you don't want to move on me
You just want to talk, because soon as move on me
It's a body, it's a body, it's a body, we're gone'
Catch a body, catch a body, catch a body
I got a whole lot of soldier, you could never move on me
All you do is talk, because soon as you move on me
It's a body, it's a body, it's a body, we're gone'
Catch a body, catch a body, catch a body
