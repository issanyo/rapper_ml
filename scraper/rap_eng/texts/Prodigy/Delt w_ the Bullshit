[Prodigy]
Dunn it's real like that

[Havoc]
Uh huh yeah
Uh huh yeah(uh huh)
Yeah, ha(solo on that ass ? dealt with the bullshit)
Check me out dunn(yeah)
Check me out now(out yo)

Yo
Feel me on the road, feel me at the shows
Feel me for what I stand for
And I'mma do it til the death til I can't no more
Fuck a ho, it's all about dough
Still, fuck her and still don't love em
That's word to mother
Un-cover the truth, enjoy my youth
It's die or lose
I wonder what if I was sittin in the pen
On the strength that I had to hurt something
Cuz my stomach hurtin
I'm a cool nigga, but don't let me start buggin
Love my moms, love my little sis, plus my little dunn
Niggas gotta eat, fuck settling for crumbs
Hell no, me a bum on the streets looking dumb
Til hell freezes over yo y'all niggas better run

[Hook](Repeated 2x)
(Havoc)
Cuz I done dealt with the bullshit
Lived through the bullshit
So put a clamp on them loose lips
My niggas do kill shit (pow pow, pow pow pow)

[Prodigy]
Guns redundant
My dunns move in abundance
We loose cannons, my rugar will pop somethin
What's all the frontin
Being cavilier will get you nothing
Or maybe touched though
Keep pressing me and we be thumpin like The Lords vs. The Hawks
When little boy got a foot long stuck in his back
And punctured his lungs
It's very brutal, how the N.I.C. will do you
Yo get KO'ed and pissed on for being rude
Yeah, respect the colors and the flag i wave
Respect the I.M.D. embroidery
My shit is classic and authentic
Blowin dick
Y'all niggas grafting my whole presence
Get your own shit
My voltage, be higher than the wire pole get
King vulture, more flyer than your average rap pigeon
Now, twist up your cheebas
I get deeper in debt
My rap page make niggas throw they reefer at us
Love me, bless me, like you supposed to do
Just don't test me niggas I be toasted up
What(echoes)

[Havoc]
Cuz I done dealt with the bullshit and lived through the bullshit

[Hook #2]
Cuz I done dealt with the bullshit
Lived through the bullshit(no doubt no doubt, yeah yeah yeah)
So put a clamp on them loose lips
My niggas do kill shit(pow pow, pow pow pow)

[Prodigy]
My style, identical to guns that burst
I'm like a fourth when I go off, or even worse
It's like an ill box cutter fight where no one backs down
My shit burn, make em far from a clown

[Havoc]
Ay yo, likewise
See a nigga that I can't trust is a nigga I despise
Then I, reply with a cold shoulder
You ain't a gat holder, you just a crossover switchover

Chorus #2

[Hook #3]
Cuz I done dealt with the bullshit
Lived through the bullshit(uh huh, yeah)
So put a clamp on them loose lips
My niggas do kill shit(pow pow, pow pow pow)
