[Hook]
Something more, something more than faith
Something more, something more than fairytales
The story of a little star, looking for a place to shine his light
At first he'd gone astray, but now he found his way
And so he shines the brightest in the sky

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
I designed an oasis, wide open spaces
Butt naked bitches having sexual relations
Major operation, let me take conversations
Sensitive intel, pay attention to detail
Yeah, design the flat, not your vital signs
AC, DC, alkaline, whichever type of battery you got in your back
Gon' be removed when the clips get slapped
You and your bitch get slapped, damn, it's good to be back

[Hook]
Something more, something more than faith
Something more, something more than fairytales
The story of a little star, looking for a place to shine his light
At first he'd gone astray, but now he found his way
And so he shines the brightest in the sky

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
My hip hop is outstanding, outlasting
All of these dwarf stars, they fizz a lot fast week
Burn like the sun and you suck like a black hole
Suck in my style and get over my flagpole
These colors don't run, we attract to
Drama like madness, you wanna get your head flew
Incredible bars, I show 'em how to rhyme
I'm not the average, no in fact I'm
Super rap killer, extremely great spitter
Make a dope, hit a door, solve the queen's riddler
Sinister, ill enough to bang with the sickest
So get up and get down with the sickness
This is something more than just songs
I wish upon the stars, pray to God that I come with
Better lines than them, to crush their dreams
And attempts at my sport when I do this thing

[Hook]
Something more than faith
The story of a little star, looking for a place to shine his light
At first he'd gone astray, but now he found his way
And so he shines the brightest in the sky

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
What you know about death, money and sacrifice?
What you know about people scheming to take your life?
I'm tryna tell you, what know about these Cali G's?
That mister penitentiary invested movement on a bigger better day
What you know about the harder man?
We paint the art of war to decorate the promised land
You understand, it's in my nature not to walk away
Cause I'm a beast, my beats'll open up your chest and face
Call the police, it's not the same and I don't give a fuck
I speak the truth and now my catalogues are living trust
Now give it up and get it, take it at gun point
We cut-throat niggas in what point
You gonna realize we came for

[Hook]
Something more than fairytales
Is a story of a little star, looking for a place to shine his light
