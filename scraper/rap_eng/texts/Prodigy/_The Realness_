[Intro: George S. Patton]
I don’t want to get any messages saying that
“We are holding out position.”
We’re not holding anything!
Let the Hun do that
We are advancing constantly!

[Hook: Prodigy]
Yo on some real shit
They wish they could live like this
They all stuck off the realness
They pray they could be this good
Bend down on some real shit
They wish they could live like this
They all stuck off the realness
They pray they could be this good good good

[Verse 1: Realm Reality]
On the FDR city lights paying any cost
Chain heavy bezzy floss
Necessary for every sport
In a passenger coup she tatted with hoops
And she fine enough to act in a movie modeling shoots
It's the consequence for writing in booths inviting the truth
I define my life inside of my borough blinded by proof
That I was meant to do what the fuck I want excuse my french
Your crew attempts are futile they poodles that only take the bench
We ain't convinced you hood enough you talkin' crazy
Actin' like you deep with connects but he just next to Haiti (AD lib: He's just dominican)
A brooklyn boy cruising slowly in manhattan
Deep in thought seeing the bigger court so it can happen
Mind over matter rap they just cataracts
I splatter cats I'm guilty like they handed me a random axe
Fuck it let the record play let's burn a leaf
I'm headed to the strip club to forget my grief

[Hook: Prodigy]

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Once again it's that live infamous nigga with endless shine
Untouchable don perignon that fly
NYC badboy notorious really
The HNIC of rap boy I gets busy
I'm alejandro sosa of the sixteen bars
The way I manufacture these drugs that you call songs
So much dope I done wrote
My feelings is numb
No I ain't feelin' none of that shit you spittin' is dumb
Retard as nigga tryin' rock with the uber
Hip hop god expert rapper I chew ya
This is realm reality where everything's real things
Niggas is very different they nothing like my team it's
No time for fake ones
Come and smoke a little bit with these real ones
Live a little dangerous don't be a shook one
You can't live your whole so weak now G up

[Hook: Prodigy]

[Verse 3: Realm Reality]
On the BQE easily doing eight three
Nice off the henny approaching the exit that I need
She got my jeans loose I'm guessing too much grey goose
Her thoughts on my lap while I'm avoiding all the scenic routes
Brooklyn best believe that I'm repping you to the fullest
You taught me how to handle my situations with bullets
But I ain't never owned a gun I'm shooting for the stars I see
Never loosing sight of my inner city mentality
Too fly for gravity fuck you if you ain't family
If winning meant a condo we high above on that balcony
Addicted to gutter music I love to do it
Blame it on my need to succeed inside of the streets of bushwick
Seat back ride slow in your hood rap
Finished eating chinese food you feeling good relaxed
A big ol' fatty twitted to roll thru
Another summer night in the city I thought I told you

[Hook: Prodigy]
