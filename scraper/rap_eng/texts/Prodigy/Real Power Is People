(Sample)
"They are a secret network of international pirates
Who identify with no nation, no national flag
And no established religion
Their flag is the skull and cross bones
And their God, G.O.D. spells Gold, Oil, and Drugs."
(Prodigy talking)
One, two, aiight
Yeah, that's right, uh-huh
Uh, uh

[Prodigy]
Live from the belly, they got me behind the fence
I run shit from the inside of the fucking President
Of the Infamous Gang - get whiff from my stank
I got that iky-iky cotton picky shit that have you dazed
I'm a quadruple O.G., a O so call me
The reincarnation of the Pharaoh with an Olde E
The barrel full of hot lead; shoot a pot head
Talking that shit about Hip-Hop dead
Nah it's alive behind the gate; permanent smiley face
Any nigga stunting on the God; nah you outta place
I beat a lot of cases had to take an L
I see you in a hot sec', yep hold it down

(Chorus)
Money's worthless, real power is people
Real strength is in the streets where everybody's equal
Fuck jewelry, fuck rims; let's spend on our protection
Get armor, get cameras, get wit' it lil nigga this man's shit
Real power is people
Real strength is in the streets where everybody's equal

[Prodigy]
This is live from behind the wall
Sitting, starring at the wall
I'm fit to pop out this bitch like a newborn
I'm fit to cut out all the smoking and the drinking
The wine and the spirits is evil where you take it baby
So I'm telling the truth, you live it then you see it
You breathe it then you be it
I'll tell you a lil secret
It's a secret government that worship an owl
They practice witchcraft to harness their power
Pedophile rape lil kids for energy
The Satanic rituals; W.T.C. (R.I.P.)
They let the Pentagon on fire
That's lightening the pentagram on fire
All these bodies for what?
So you could scare everybody into one world huh?
All my grime's is on deck
So if you ain't come for war then run

(Chorus)

*Crowd protesting and gunfire*
