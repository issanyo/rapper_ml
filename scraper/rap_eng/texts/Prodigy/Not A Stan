(Verse 1)
When I'm pissed off I listen to Mobb Deep
My pain goes away, my tension is released
Cause P understands me and Havoc knows best
They tellin my whole life with that shit they said
When my lady start beefin I turn em up louder to drown out the sound of her voice
Oh you hear the sounds of the infamous Empire State Boys
I vicariously live thru they story
You, say I'm a Stan but I beg to differ
I'm just a real nigga, recognize real when I
See it or hear it, it's very distinctive
You can't make this shit up, you can't fake it
So instead of killin somebody I just sing along
Make me wanna go catch a body but then I get calm
Cause Prodigy said to make love not war
So even though the music is murder I stay on
My peaceful shit, just leave me alone I feel like a teenager in my room, danger zone
Just give me a little space and let me cool off with my favorite collection of songs

(Verse 2)
When life gets hard I listen to the Mobb
So even if I'm broke I still got songs
To fix my emotions and get my mind right
So if things go left I'mma be alright
Even on my deathbed
The last thing I wanna hear before I sign out Is that Queen shit, I've got 99 problems but my music ain't one
Look I can't find a job and my bitch cheatin son
I can't afford a whip so I ride the train
With my headphones on, in another world man
Havoc said I could shit on the world
Once I start 4 wheelin I'mma find another girl
That's why I pay attention to the lyrics cause everything they say is all realist
When niggas argue about the best rap groups I'll be damn near, ready to fight for my dudes
Fuck top 5, my niggas top 3 Mobb Deep last longer than tomorrow, you'll see
Everybody else just a bunch of wannabes
They wanna be like Hav and be like P

(Verse 3)
Whenever I feel like I just wanna quit I vibe with the most infamous there is
Cause these other dudes soft, I can't relate
Mobb Deep is my proverbial therapy
They the voice of the ghetto
These other rappers only speak for the corporate world
That's why they can't get no, Space in my mp3
It's no room for the garbage they tryna sell me
Dom Perignon, P bars, get me hype and remind me that I could do whatever in life
Different people find motivation in different things
When I was locked up it was HNIC he
Gave me the strength to make it out alive
So when P got locked up you know I had to strive
Just to show my respect to the man that raised me
With music thats one of a kind and trailblazing
He wrote me back, I almost passed out
See I knew he was down to earth, I never had doubts
Your punch lines and metaphors is cool
But when it come to just being dope Mobb Deep rule
