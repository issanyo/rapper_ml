Yeah, let them know chip, hey
I'm just saying lil shawty, what it do?
Hey, what's happening?
Once you get that map to a nigga ma
And bring that back to a nigga ma
Oh yeah you scared of a nigga, huh?
But what you running from a nigga for?
Get right, roll the dice
If you knew how I do it, you would roll it nice
So what you scared of mama, I'm getting bread lil mama
Hey all I wanna do is get a handout
What's happening? Hey lil shawty, what's happening
Get your mind right, hey what's happening?
When I was doing my sets up in the yard
All that was on my mind was my broad
My star, you the bassest bitch
Just the thought of us together got me extra bit
I went extra hard, so I can sex you long
So it's not just good, it's extra raw
Baby feel on my chest, I made that for you
And you can squeeze off my back and scratch up my tattoos
I'ma show you how love is supposed to feel
Is supposed to be fun, we're supposed to chill
I'ma be your fairytale story book dream
Leave all the lights on, this needs to be seen
So we can remember this forever
Like gucci embedded in your brain I'm better
Than any of these boys you was toying with
While I was gone so long on that up north trip
Hey, what's happening?
Once you get that map to a nigga ma
And bring that back to a nigga ma
Oh yeah you scared of a nigga, huh?
But what you running from a nigga for?
Get right, roll the dice
If you knew how I do it, you would roll it nice
So what you scared of mama
I'm getting bread lil mama
Hey all I wanna do is get a handout
What's happening? Hey lil shawty, what's happening
Get your mind right, hey what's happening?
When I was in the can I was getting my back strong
On the while thinking of you when I get back home
Drinking pine apple juice all night
So I can taste sweet in your mouth is alright
I'm taking you to new heights and new dimensions
Sunsets, sunrise, we still ripping
The hotel same beach and apart
We scream jesus, how could it still be so hard
We take breaks for cold drinks and dinner in bed
And after we finish, you know what desert is
The real flavor of love
Damn is so good, I ain't tryna share none
This is real gangsta love
Matching attitude, yeah, his and hers
Beat it up so right, the feline will go numb
It's big novocain needle of mine, it's like waaaa
Hey, what's happening?
Once you get that map to a nigga ma
And bring that back to a nigga ma
Oh yeah you scared of a nigga, huh?
But what you running from a nigga for?
Get right, roll the dice
If you knew how I do it, you would roll it nice
So what you scared of mama
I'm getting bread lil mama
Hey all I wanna do is get a handout
What's happening?
