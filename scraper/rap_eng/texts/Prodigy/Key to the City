(You better check yourself, sucka!)

[Hook x2: Nina Sky & Alchemist]
In the streets we heavy, on the block we very
New York, New Yorkin'
Got the keys to the city, oh, oh, uh huh, uh huh, oh
Oh, oh, uh huh, uh huh, oh

[Verse 1: Alchemist]
Yeah, let me tell you how I feel...
Yo, I keep it real hood, I'm making them
My deal's good, I'm eating so you know that my meal's good
They ask me how I'm living, I just tell them I'm still good
Still going hard, point guard, because I handle the bill good
Push pedal to metal, still handle the wheel good
I drop shit, yeah you know that I spill good
My name good, slick talking, my game good
Architect of rap, I'm shaping the frame wood
Caked up, try to make a move and get shaked up
Put down to the ground and get scraped up
I wake up, throw my sneakers on and then lace up
Go hit the chop shop and get shaped up
I'm in it to win it, there's no limit so I'm raising the stakes up
My dice game is so outrageous, because I go all out
Like when I'm rocking sold out stages
Now my rap book is flooded, got to throw out pages

[Hook x2: Nina Sky & Prodigy]
In the streets we heavy, on the block we very
New York, New Yorkin'
Got the keys to the city, oh, oh, uh huh, uh huh, oh
Oh, oh, uh huh, uh huh, oh

(You better check yourself, sucka!)

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
They want me to, get on my grizzly
And rap like I'm sixteen, they say P got lazy
Lately, he gets busy
You heard the Mac is back, the H.N.I Shizzy
Same niggas with me, since the beginning
You see Havoc and Twin, Gotti and God
Noyd and Ty Nitty, we define the city
Of New York, you're too soft
My shit so hardcore it knock you off course
I, I get money, you see me in the video
I, I get paid, I, I'm so made
It's, money over bum bitches, youse' a civilian
I'm an infamous soldier, in a G-Unit fitted
It's, Dutch Schultz and, Bumpy Johnson
The hoodlum nigga, squeeze my trigger at your noggin'
I ain't for the nonsense, it's gonna be a body on the ground
Keep fuck around...
Keep testing the water, you gone' surely drown
Alchemist will hold you down
You got that cocaine, but it's doper than dope
You're in the wrong lane
Your little umbrella won't protect you from the reign (rain)

[Hook x2: Nina Sky & Prodigy & Alchemist]
In the streets we heavy, on the block we very
New York, New Yorkin'
Got the keys to the city, oh, oh, uh huh, uh huh, oh
Oh, oh, uh huh, uh huh, oh
