[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
DMT, peyote, I know you feel me
P's song is a natural tryptamine
My rhymes is so vivid, you start to see things
Way different, America's fake
I was fast asleep, but now I'm wide awake
I was under the spell of Kingu and reserved notes
Religion and fashion, I used to be flashy
'Til I had a total recall, forgot what I've already knew
It took me 33 years for me to see the truth
Ever so clear I was too young
I couldn't articulate myself the right way son
But now let me break it down, pass it all around
This is not a theory, lift the spirits, see his spirit
They wanna put me in a strait jacket in a padded room
And tell the world there's 12 monkeys so they can be confused

[Hook]
Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Secret Society trying to keep their eye on me
But I'ma stay incogni' in places they can't find me
Make my moves strategically
Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Secret Society trying to keep their eye on me
But I'ma stay incogni' in places they can't find me
Make my moves strategically

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
They say life is like chess
But fuck that I'm tired of playing games with you kids
Ain't no time for playing, check the rhymes I'm sayin'
I write it for the streets for the hood inspiration
Inspire every party to map where it's poverty
I started with a Mobb but now I got an army
With soldiers and troopers
The TV and the radio scared to death of us
So we hit the YouTube up
Now I got millions of views
Now watch how many rappers follow what P do
Now I'm too hoody to conform to the program
I'm too much of a rebel for me to try to fit in
Nigga! It don't matter on the color of your skin
Right now you either positive or you negative
I got friends in high places, multiple races
And coaches on my side, all you got is paper

[Hook]
Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Secret Society trying to keep their eye on me
But I'ma stay incogni' in places they can't find me
Make my moves strategically
Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Secret Society trying to keep their eye on me
But I'ma stay incogni' in places they can't find me
Make my moves strategically
