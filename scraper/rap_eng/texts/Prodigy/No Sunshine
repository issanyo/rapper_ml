[Intro]
Man, I remember growing up
Well, you know, living my last 5 dollars
I see nobody there

[Hook: French Montana]
Now I hope you fuck niggas get better
Stop my team no never
We gon' be here
Countin' all this cash, my niggas all in here
You ain't gotta ask
We been ballin' all year, oohhh
Cause ain't no sunshine when your cheese gone
When your cheese gone, ooohh

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Money be the root of evil
Hanging on the block with dirty eagle
Around fiends with dirty needles
The lawyers fee so they never keep you
A broken dreams what them niggas feed you

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
Watch the game from the tour, thats 4 seats
Act like they never knew you but they all speak
Rain wrist, watch and chain thats a 4 piece
Seen murders so bad they needed 4 sheets

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Satisfaction when I made his head spin
A 57 spun and made him do the backspin
My pipe smoke more than the crackheads
Biv him up to God he then high as permanent

[Verse 4: French Montana]
Ain't no sunshine when the money gone
Me and my wrist shinin', about 20 homes
Had 40 homies, about 20 gone
Niggas buying cars taking out 20 loans

[Verse 5: Chinx Drugz]
Hung around some millionaires and made a couple large
Figured Id stay around longer and make a couple Ms
Drunk, hissy niggas hold me while I stumble off
Niggas hating so hard, I need 20 tips

[Verse 6:Prodigy]
Yeah, bird niggas just food for my desert eagle
Eat till it's all gone, there's no running to the people
Nightmares, cold sweats, I'm trippin'
My worst fear is being broke like you, its forbidden

[Verse 7: French Montana]
Its forbidden I be in cold sittin'
Pole spendin' with the hustle, made a pole lift
A reason why your ho missin'
In the crib with no clothes cuz the niggas crib for poes listed
40 long nose, Scott Pippen
Start fishin' Water blue seats
Top missing
Count money, breaking down
Work the same motion
Shark in the tank, small fish in the ocean

[Verse 8: Chinx Drugz]
Collect calls from the pens, talkin' through receivers
Now a nigga done blew up like hiroshima
Wide body, blowin' Cali, rollin' through Medina
'bout 100 racks soaking in the jewellery cleaner
Try your hardest not to snitch
But you been subpoenaed
3 quarter chinchilla for the winter season
Collect calls from the pens, talking through the glass
Cos I ran up in your crib, talking through a mask

[Verse 9: Prodigy]
Ferrari dirt bikes on the turn pipe
Dirty New York niggas, get that dough like
The fuck else is there to do?
Fuck a dumb bitch, I'm gettin dumb rich
Making power moves
Keep my piss clean, so I never get kept
With parole, piss means to much to miss
Out here in the fast
You must be shittin' me
I'm way to champagne

[Hook: French Montana]
I hope you fuck niggas get better
Stop my team no never
You niggas gon' be here
Countin' all this cash, my niggas all in here
You ain't gotta ask
Niggas been ballin' all year
Ain't no sunshine when your cheese gone
When your cheese gone, ooohh
Uh-oh

[Outro]
Ay, you know who you real niggas is
When you're down to your last 5 dollars and you get that
4 dollar nickel bag and a dutch
It's some nasty shit
On the flip side of the coin
You know what what a real nigga is
When he get some real money
And that's how you show me how you really flip
Ya know what I mean?
Back at the end of the day
Lot of these niggas wasn't ballin before they started rappin
And a lot of niggas started rappin after they was ballin
Coke boys baby
From the back blocks for real
