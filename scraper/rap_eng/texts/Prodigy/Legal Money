[Intro: Shaquille O'Neal and Prodigy]
Prodigy
Yo, what up son?
It's your homey, make that legal money
No doubt, let's get this soon so we can sleep on the million dollar rooms, baby
Show 'em how to do it
Y'know what I'm sayin'? Legalize, kid
From Orlando to Queensboro, the Infamous Mobb
Get on your job kid
Word up, check it out son

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Superman emblem, met with the Mobb in Metropolis
We call assembly, at round table mappin' out the strategy
My faculty is Warren Allen
Know for four poundedly hittin' up rappers 'til they can't be
Highly explosive, this dangerous rap exclusive
Leave 'em hung, and Shaq frontin' (shh) is a nusiance
Thirty two, and somethin' for you and you, and him too
Superman'll hold the pill, rhyme Vanderbilt
Leavin' niggas in standstill, rapper be Queens real
We hydro, from Orlando to Queensboro
Sit back, watchin' ESPN on the eighty inch
The game's on, my thug's on too, me and Nate Dogg
The guard jet ski, Shaq ripped the river apart
You ain't been doin' this, so don't start

[Hook: Lord Tariq]
Hey yo, I'm tryin' to get this money, there's nothin' like legal money
Stackin' the cake makes rainy days sunny
One lump sum, blue chips and checks so I can play
My way, all day, everyday
I'm tryin' to get this money, there's nothin' like legal money
Stackin' the cake makes rainy days sunny
One lump sum, blue chips and checks so I can play
My way, all day, everyday

[Verse 2: Shaquille O'Neal]
Lyrical proufoundest like Mobb Deep, mission on Earth
Bust 'em speakers in jeeps, phrase of day
Don't y'all sleep on Shaq
I reconstruct abstract facts and visuals
Clocks speakers at Foot Locker for residuals
I'm beyond understanding, mystical
Of the world is super critical, physical, very lyrical
My style is tongue-slashing as well as brain-smashing
Like in your (shhh) kid, without asking
Critics be jelly, they absent minded of course
First MC ever to have shoes and mics in The Source
But of course, I ride that white horse, I'm unbelievable like Biggie
I represent Newark, New Jersey, no diggy
Puttin' this down for my fam in the future
Into my center, pull out size deuce deuce boots, then I'll boot ya
Age twenty four, y'all gon' see me in history books
Omega sci-fi represent, throw up them hooks

[Hook: Lord Tariq]
Hey yo, I'm tryin' to get this money, there's nothin' like legal money
Stackin' the cake makes rainy days sunny
One lump sum, blue chips and checks so I can play
My way, all day, everyday
I'm tryin' to get this money, there's nothin' like legal money
Stackin' the cake makes rainy days sunny
One lump sum, blue chips and checks so I can play
My way, all day, everyday

[Verse 3: Havoc]
The unbelievable mystic, top notch so cock the pist'
Forty first side be lifted, drama we with it, teflon
Recommended, fully automatic, approved
Get that vest ready, shook ones, throw on your running shoes
We runnin' crews, danger, without the warning
Night without the morning, dawn to dusk, you'll get that mug rushed
Cream is a must, so in myself I trust
Trust nobody else and make moves with delf
Legalize is wise guys, Queensbridge enterprise
Take this money rock, to all my shorties, keep it tight
No doubt, we gon' start, me and my Infamous clique
Nine six to the year Two-G, handle your business
Get dough, sip the Alize everyday, all day
Pop the bubbley, you ain't got nothin' for me
We shinin', still shinin', combinin'
Working, diamond mindin', kid you still searchin'
Jealous and gellin', care less, records is sellin'
Platinum plates, laid back, life is great and good to us
Pay checks, give me that head rush
That early mornin' thoughts is that I need more C
Son, it's on, yo what he say, I'd be right back
It's like that, and Diesel Shaq got my back

[Hook: Lord Tariq]
Hey yo, I'm tryin' to get this money, there's nothin' like legal money
Stackin' the cake makes rainy days sunny
One lump sum, blue chips and checks so I can play
My way, all day, everyday
I'm tryin' to get this money, there's nothin' like legal money
Stackin' the cake makes rainy days sunny
One lump sum, blue chips and checks so I can play
My way, all day, everyday

[Outro: Havoc]
Yeah, Mobb Deep, big Shaq on ya back
Get ready for attack 'cause it's like that
Ha
