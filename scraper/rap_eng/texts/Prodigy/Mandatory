[Verse 1: Conway]
Yeah, look
They hate you when you winnin'
I been knew I was great from the beginnin'
That's why real niggas relate to shit I written
Look, my dog caught a gun case and went to prison
Caught a new one on parole, got a detainer, so he sittin'
He said, "Con, them niggas hate you, so they ain't gon' see your vision
I'm good behind this wall, dog, just make sure that you kill 'em"
I feel him (I feel you my nigga)
30 shot clips, I fill 'em to the top
Hit 'em up with the Glocks, or I MAC-10 'em
Balmain denim
I hustle for 4 days in 'em
Let the 4 blaze, and 4 strays hit 'em
One van, 4 goons, plus 4 K's in 'em
They snorted a 8-ball, more raw 'caine in 'em
I told 'em don't even come back if y'all ain't kill 'em
I'm the illest, every bar is pure snake venom
All my pots got resi' from the raw flake in 'em
Taa, and them folk scrapes in 'em, ha
Whip up, whip up
Keep runnin' your dick suckers
I'ma pick the fifth up
Blick up your body, leavin' wounds you can't stitch up
It's us, GxFR, grip the 500 Smith up
Shit hit a building and chip the bricks up, what
Bustin' and fuck my wrist up
He snitch, fuck him, cut the nigga tongue out his mouth
And sew his lips up
Look, you can't fuck with the shit that I wrote
Didn't like and ripped up
Me and Daringer whipped another brick up

[Chorus: Cormega samples]
"The-the-the-the, the-the-the-the drama is a part of me"
"Son, son, you know the drilly"
"It's mandatory"
"The-the-the-the, the-the-the-the drama is a part of me"
"Son, son, you know the drilly"
"It's mandatory"

[Verse 2: Conway]
Look, look
Fifth tucked in my drawers
Dog, you ain't a killer, you ain't never blick nothin' before
And if you blick somethin', you never hit nothin' before
I will carve you up nice, put a big cut in your jaw
My homie 24, but he been fuckin' with raw
When he was 20, he had 20 bricks stuffed in the wall
I'm the God, I can have your bitch fuckin' us all
Bagged the bitch in Versace, got my dick sucked in the store
Fiends sayin' my white hit hard like Jack Dempsey
Killa Tone spray your trap 'til the MAC empty
Look, I ain't one of them rap niggas that act friendly
I will clap any one of y'all, keep my gun involved
Pack the black semi
Wig shot him, little pieces of his brain
Stained up my blue and black Pennys
Honest, I get the rocket launcher from Mohammed, kaif halak
Straight pop it at you 'til you ain't conscious (Machine, nigga)

[Chorus: Cormega samples]
"The-the-the-the, the-the-the-the drama is a part of me"
"Son, son, you know the drilly"
"It's mandatory"
"The-the-the-the, the-the-the-the drama is a part of me"
"Son, son, you know the drilly"
"It's mandatory"

[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9"]
I'm the hardest nigga out
It'll even be hard for God to figure out, I'm a Godly figure out
In the streets like a Harley
Nigga, I stand tall, and I hardly see a taller nigga out, at all
Here it is in laymen's
You don't wanna act hard fam, I follow him on 'Gram
Lure him to the backyard jam
For war with him, report him to spam, right after I spray him
As far as the booth
Man I just go in there (?) with bows and arrows on
In rare form 'til I'm either blowin' some headphones
Or seein a (?) airborne
Fuckin' with Conway and Gunn up in Buffalo, with my Buffalo Cartiers on
Probably ridin' with my fire red bone
I'm on fire, her ears be burnin' when she ain't with me
So now she'll probably live long
She like to party, pop molly and lollygag
I drop bodies and party crash with Glock shotties
You know I gotta, hit him for the gold that sit in the safe
100,000 gunsmoke rounds got him like, "oh, we get it, you vape"
That's what the gorillas did, I'm everything you feel you ain't
Assassinate characters like Twitter did to Azealia Banks
Fly niggas deviant, wild niggas obedience
Me and my compadres in a (?) lookin' for head like Sade
But nah, I ain't no R&B nigga
It's either my way or (hehe), y'all hoes Beat It then
I ain't got no game and these bitches just understand my story
Nickel 9 and Conway the animal, boy, it's mandatory

[Chorus: Cormega samples]
"The-the-the-the, the-the-the-the drama is a part of me"
"Son, son, you know the drilly"
"It's mandatory"
"The-the-the-the, the-the-the-the drama is a part of me"
"Son, son, you know the drilly"
"It's mandatory"
