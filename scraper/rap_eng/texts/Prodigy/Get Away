[Verse 1: Havoc]
Sometimes I feel I got to (get away)
For these streets like a fein for crack
But pullin me back

My heart is your hood my dogs niggas I rock with (get away)
Before you get clapped put the tongues to two loose have everybody on the corner goin (ooh ooh)
Holdin they mouth shocked as fuck I just had to air that boy out (get away)
And now theres blood on my tims snitches callin' 1-800 crime stoppers
When they see me they like (ooh ooh)

And not only that; police will die to catch a fucking collar (get away)
And I'm out of here ain't no telling when I be back

‘Cause I'm not playin I'm bangin hammers on niggas

When we come through pushing new trucks
Bitches be pushing and shoving to look at us
They go (ooh ooh) yeah take a good look bitch

Then (get away) ‘cause somebody bout to die
And it's going to be a stampede when them shots fly

Uh huh, yeah you out of here, nigga!

[Verse 3: Havoc & Prodigy]
It's either me or you
Believe me dog, know a nigga like you ain't got shit to lose
But you walking that thin line

And put it past me
That ass be bleeding somewhere like a hemophiliac exactly
(Shut the fuck up)
Before it's to late, go at your gut
You ain't a gangster and yes you could get touched

‘Cause these niggas always laying on their back

[Hook: Havoc]

If he tryin' blown it go
Wit no remorse kid its the cold hearted
Queens nigga grimy retarted you know
