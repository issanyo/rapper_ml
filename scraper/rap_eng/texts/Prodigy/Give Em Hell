[Intro]
They took permanent vacations in Hell, if you know what I mean
Wow, I must have been away too long, because my feelings are dead
I feel no remorse…

[Prodigy]
Global state of mind, I’m seeing far beyond my nose
Ten years from now, I’ll still be around, spitting my flows
Ten years from now, you’ll be a memory that no one knows
I don’t feel sorry for you niggas, my feelings are cold
People dying – life goes on, it’s…
Nothing you can do about it, just be strong, yeah
Dead-weight niggas try to pull you down with ‘em
They like psychic vampires, suck the life out you
Mentally, I’m focused, think like a Marine
Oorah, I ride or die for shit that I believe, like…
Nobody could stop me
I’m the illest rapper probably on the earth, niggas copy
Every line that I draw, these rappers is frauds
My artwork expensive, they cannot afford
RSVP, Circa 2012
How dare a nigga to try and stop me, give him Hell

[Hook]
Oh, word? They put a hit out on me?
Give ‘em Hell
They wanna threaten my wellbeing?
Give ‘em Hell
And tell Satan throw some heat rocks up
For the world’s most hottest rapper spitting flames like a volcano
Yeah, they wanna turn on me?
Give ‘em Hell
They wanna stretch me out in the street?
Give ‘em Hell
And tell Satan throw some heat rocks up
For the world’s most hottest rapper spitting flames like a volcano

[Verse 2]
Aye yo, aye yo, they know, they know
I’ll blow a nigga away like tornados
Niggas with me, they move whenever I say so
Watch out for the D’s, unmarked cars and plainclothes
Niggas must be crazy, they gone off that yayo
Maybe smoking stones, I don’t know, I’ll be okay, though
I’m God’s solider, devil’s apostle, it’s harvest time
You reap what you sew when you cross the line
It’s beyond repair – I am so beyond fear
That shit is childish, do what you must, niggas beware
I am – slippery when wet off that ‘maldehyde
Smoke a Dutch full of dust, pull a homo
Niggas wouldn’t side with you if they knew what I know
I can see you bullshit niggas with my eyes closed
I’ve got a deadly rap
So these jokers wanna ruin my time, I’ll handle that

[Hook]
