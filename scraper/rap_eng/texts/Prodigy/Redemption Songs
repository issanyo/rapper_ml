Hello
From the top of the world, wishing you were here
So you could see things from my P.O.V
It's a long way down, but I never look back
Though it's over now, know it's life or death
Life being: to reach my goals, death being to die
I wish poverty on no man and struggle on no woman
Gone are the days of old, we've crossed the threshold into a new era
Of prosperity & peace
Is there heaven and hell? You will find out getting in my way
But for those who agree, please celebrate with us, as we proceed to succeed

I take non- believers and change they whole view
They spend a little time, they singing a new tune
I get it forever, P foreverly fresh
Name a rapper more sinister than Perignon is
I pop pain, AK's, and currency bands
My skid mark's on fire I peel off so fast
This is deeper than rap, Infamous is a brand- a lifestyle, not a movement
Our bullets go 'blam'
Look I'm a seasoned vet marinaded in the trash on corners of the slum- dirty New York
I am with the cleanest swag, and the meanest V
If your want the Feds want then I'm what the Feds need

These are new age rules, new age moves
Only thing I can't fuck with is these new age dudes
But it's the world and the people that I'm subject to
I get this digital money and stay inside of my groove
Making new age rules, new age moves
Only thing I can't fuck with these new age dudes
But it's the world and the people that I'm subject to
I get this digital money and stay inside of my groove

As a kid they used to call me 'little big time'
That was then, and this now
Now they call me 'King Rhyme'
Globally I stand, Infamous to eternity
I infinitely do this shit
I cut that fucking tat off your head if you ever cross me

Niggas screaming mutiny?
I toss niggas off to the sharks
H.N.I.C. 3- Redemption songs
This is how God intended it
Red Carpet shit, Black ties and new black dresses
Don't let the camera flash blind you
R.S.V.P. all grown up now
There is no excuse
Nothing can stop the power of God
This is God's plan
This is the way God intended it
