[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Can't nobody fuck around with VP
Or else you're gonna find yourself D-E-A-D
Y'all ain't got your eye on the prize, you can't see
Cause I ain't really livin' my life for Plan B
Anybody brave enough to come against me
Gonna find your body in the bottom of the Dead Sea
How dare you ever in your life walk past me
Without acknowledging this man as G-O-D
I always been here, always been deranged focus
The heat is always in my hand like chain smokers
Hard work, dedication and sustained dopeness
Bust a motherfucker's head 'til his brain opens
Stay cookin' in the kitchen like we are sofrito
I was always smoking wakata with papi people
I ain't never doing anything that's not illegal
Read the Torah lord, black mask, black evil

[Hook: Vinnie Paz and Mobb Deep]
This is duel to the death, this is murder, death, kill
Stay real, because the sun can't chill
M-O-B-B, ain't nobody playin' 'round
Vinnie P-P, fuck around, lay around
This is duel to the death, this is murder, death, kill
Stay real, because the sun can't chill
M-O-B-B, ain't nobody playin' 'round
Vinnie P-P, fuck around, lay around

[Verse 2: Havoc]
I'll have you laid out, Posturepedic
Before the day's out, somebody gon' be layin' bleedin'
Keep fuckin' with me, bring me to the darker side
Where the wolves play and nothing but your karma lie
Get it back tenfold, yeah, I do you dirty
I'm in my dirty thirties, that means I'm past the worry
I got it mapped out, every plan hashed out
Perfectly executed, squeeze 'til I'm fresh out
I got goonies, all they do is stick their neck out
For a nigga, cause his loyalty is nothing less
And when it's on, you know they got them toolies on deck
What you looking at, boy? You ain't a boss yet
Infamous, yeah, we celebrate life
Pour liquor for the dead, kill niggas on sight
When they get beside themselves, we run up right upon 'em
Leave 'em where they stand and pour some fuckin' liquor on 'em

[Hook: Vinnie Paz and Mobb Deep]
This is duel to the death, this is murder, death, kill
Stay real, because the sun can't chill
M-O-B-B, ain't nobody playin' 'round
Vinnie P-P, fuck around, lay around
This is duel to the death, this is murder, death, kill
Stay real, because the sun can't chill
M-O-B-B, ain't nobody playin' 'round
Vinnie P-P, fuck around, lay around

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Let me start from the beginning at the top of the list
First off, nobody can do it like this
No matter how hard you try, hard you go
No matter how hard your beats, ill your flow
Can't fuck with P, yeah, this we know
I'm not a rapper, I'm a master of ceremonial
Gatherings at venues is jam-packed
Fuck rap, I'm in it for cream and that's that
Tryna stop my dough? I run you off the map
Tryna stop my life? I'll blow you out your hat
The most thuggish, the most ruggish
The most AKAs you heard of is
Bandanna, banana clip, RIP
I can't help it, my career don't cease
My name don't wear out, I go on forever
That other shit a passing fad, it won't ever
