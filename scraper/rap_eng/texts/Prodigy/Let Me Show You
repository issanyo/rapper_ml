[Featuring: Vaughn Anthony]
Look at us, we murda dem, yeah
Even if we on the project benches
I make you feel like it's nowhere better you can be
It ain't all about material possessions
But you can't front, it gives us access to a lot more
Thangs
In New York for breakfast
And by dinner we be eating ...overseas
If you a little jetlag let's just
Play the hotel suit, room service on me
My baby we London, Italy, south of France
New York, L.A., it's how we dance
Front row, camera seats and red carpets
Black top is and little black dresses
When it's pouring rain, we completely dry
And when it's hot, we cool in the fan
The finest bottles of wine and champagne
Your highness, your chariot awaits
I can feel your heart beat rising
When I'm near you, or I'm chasing, girl
Hearts all over the world tonight
Could it be for the love that I have for you
I can feel your heart beat baby
In excited, cause you know I'm a rider
And you like it I feel more than my own life
Baby trust in me and let me show you girl
Candier service, vip treatment
The artist entrance and exist We make our presence
Felt Then disappear into the blackness
Of the twilight in the phantom
Crobic flight, the audi space, sitting on a crescent
Moon Swinging our legs, then we walk right up to the
Sun Holding hands we rule the world
Man you girlfriend
Non stop pleasure endless ends
If you feel like you dreaming I'll pinch your skin
To remind you how real this is and blessed we are
They can only imagine the life we live
While we can't even remember the things we did
We had so much fun
It all seemed like a blur
Babe, this whatever you desire
I be your pilot, I can take you higher
I can feel your heart beat rising
When I'm near you, or I'm chasing, girl
Hearts all over the world tonight
Could it be for the love that I have for you
I can feel your heart beat baby
In excited, cause you know I'm a rider
And you like it
I feel more than my own life
Baby trust in me and let me show you girl
Soon you start to shook that you need a pace maker
Anywhere you wanna go, baby I'll take ya
From Ohio to Jamaica, number one traffic
You could be my girl and I can be your husband
But I gotta put a ring on it
Heart real good I can hear the beat on it
And your track ain't hot until I sing on it, V A
Popular demand, back in the sedan
Taunting on a gram, holding on your hand
I'm the man That's how you make me feel baby
This is real love Make me wanna kill
Thugs staring at your ass
Lil honey dip, you the only woman that
Got my heart making beats like my name
Rose petal trails and bubble baths
Meet you at the climax then
We chill and we laugh about
Who came first, we got the neighbors calling cops
Pop more bottles, lighting jays up
Getting more higher than the stars
Over love, all this dough that we got
It will never change us
Paparatz, snapping shots, of the 2 hottest
Me and my copilot love, she my new chronic
Get me higher than drugs, and when we're touching
It make sparks, you're my light
Though that dawn of dark
I can feel your heart beat rising
When I'm near you, or I'm chasing, girl
Hearts all over the world tonight
Could it be for the love that I have for you
I can feel your heart beat baby
In excited, cause you know I'm a rider
And you like it
I feel more than my own life
Baby trust in me and let me show you girl
