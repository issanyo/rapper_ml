[Verse 1]
Motherfucker, I'm ill, for really though
Look at all these things I got
Check out the stuff I bought
All these clothes I buy
I get big air
Yeah, I be smoking d-d-d-d

For really though

[Verse 2]
I laugh good, I'm dying
I'm falling out, I'm crying
You so pissed, I got a gold neck
With gold hands, I'm shining
Stop fronting, you lying
Go away, we not buying

I'm a- I'm a lion in the jungle
And I wanna go roar

[Verse 3]
Living life like kings
Shooting star, that's me
The paper boy, Pill Clinton
Percocet and Roxys
I'm sky high
On cloud 9
Feeling irie
You good, son? I'm righteous
My palms itching, keep getting it
Nothing you can tell us, we're living it
And we keep living it
Seat back, kicking it

I'm a- I'm a lion in the j
I'm a- I'm a lion in the j
I'm a- I'm a lion in the jungle
And I wanna go roar
