If I start rambling, don't mind me
I might get off track, but who doesn't it?
I love rap music, but I hate the fake light...
Usually calls the lord Weedy
So, I choose not to take part in it
On that extra seat, and just I do what I do
I'ma write this writters
Sometimes I'm overthink
It's not ... it's how remind myself
My clean activity flows best
Nigga, I'm not concerned you tryna make hits
It's all bullshit, if you ask me
When you bend over just to go Platinum
No, thank you
As I'd be as clearly
That I'm comfortable with myself
And that's all that matters
I made the point in my life with
I'm cool with exterming perks
I just roll my shit
And I can show you how to live to the f-ckers
But you got to follow me like Twitter
This is not the casino... it won't be sweet
Helo hard boulevard, not easy streets
Without Rhyme or Reason
I do what I love, I don't follow low sequence
(x4)

It feels so good to have my own staff
This over rappers they try it
They might like it
Spend so much time copying tunes
They don't even know what it's like to be
Themselves
Or is it that they don't like they sell
Maybe you defend who do you .. doing
What ? None
Or maybe they would love you more
Two actually tried, they never resured
I know, we act like potential and ?
Reality is not so gorgeous
The ugly truth, that you ain't got the heart to face it
You would lie, sex, money, fool, music
I score points like a ... win trophy
Yes, that nigga... balled out, but
I'm really just having fun with you
Don't hate, you should be concerned with ours
Cause my life's awsome
I'm all buried in stash food
I might take a little time off
I'm out at tropics
Sending emails, drinks, laughing
Getting tanned
Without Rhyme or Reason
I do what I love, I don't follow low sequence
