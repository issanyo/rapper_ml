Yo it seems like yesterday when we first met
I was only six but you was much older
We got more tight during the latter part of my life
We spent nights sittin’ in the crib gettin’ right
You hold me down when times is most foul
I held you underneath a tight belt
There were nights i needed you most
And you held back
Stuck up for me, maybe i was going too fast
I had to stop, figure why you wouldn’t perform
Took it slow, put you back in effect to get it on
My confidant, my right hand, my left hand
You brought the tears outta every man
The way you feel in my palms
Puts me under your charm
Affect a nigga to the point of losing his calm
I know you outside and in
I could take you apart
Put you back together again
Whilst your bodyparts all over your skin
Way beyond love cause we was close friends

Don’t, don’t, don’t hurt me again

As times flew by, the both of us grew in size
’89 you were sixteen we used to take flicks posing
Respect you more by the moment
Then i knew it wasn’t lust i was feeling
We’ve been through so much
Sometimes i have to talk to my dunn
He told me chill the fuck out
It’s just a G-U-N love

Don’t hurt me again
Don’t don’t hurt me again
(its the G-U-N love)
Don’t don’t hurt me again
(told me chill the fuck out it’s just the G-U-N love)

Awww shit, my mom busted in caught me feelin you
Remember that shit, she caught us layin in the bedroom
But those were the good old days with no trouble
Now in nineteenninetytwo, things start to crumble
Couldn’t separate us for shit, cause we was corrupt
That shit don’t mix, now here come the handcuffs
They took us both in, locked up
Then we had to part, shit i got out
But kept you for past charges
Cause i found out the last nigga you dealt with
Was wilding, out with CPT
They thought it was me
I reminisce days i used tot take you out for no reason
And just to be with you hun
Young, dumb and full of cum
I used to flash it was mine
But now i’m no better
I used to be real foul and let Noyd hit her
How about the train when you went down my pantslegs
Indecent exposure, a jakes woulda seen it
You was hot and ready to pop at any given moment
Woulda took a mans life for me if i chose it
You kept your silence and that’s what i liked the most
Until it was time for you to step up you kept it shut
I can’t help but to think back on how it was
That type of shit remind me of my G-U-N love is bugged

Don’t, don’t hurt me again

Gun jones, in case you ain’t know: well here it go
I’m speaking of my deep passion for pistols
At first, it was like a teenage love
Now it’s much more real when i’m handling ‘em
I keep a few now in case i gotta turn one loose
I’m doing shows for ? now, holding myself down nigga
It’s cause of ya mouth, it’s why you fell **blaow**
He lost all of the strength in his legs then fell down
See, thug ain’t a look it’s a way of life
And see the guns, that’s how the benevolent survive
I protect what’s positive and it’s kept me alive
Remember, we rule with an iron rod
That be the nines and the multiple guns that negative make
We took those, and beat the devil at his own game
So why you grillin’ me, wrinkling up your face posing?
Walking with a extra bop because you holding
Pulling your pantslegs up like you about to jump
I know how you feel cuzzo, you really not a punk
But don’t let your emotions take over your thought
Don’t get yourself murdered over G-U-N love
You heard? are you listening?
Wisen up ‘fore you wind up bleedin’and missin’
Its real…

Don’t don’t hurt me again
(dunn love)
Don’t, don’t hurt me again
(it’s G-U-N love)
(chill the fuck out its just G-U-N love for real)
