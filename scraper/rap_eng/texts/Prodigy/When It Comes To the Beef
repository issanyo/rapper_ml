[Intro: Prodigy]
Yeah, so what we gon’ do here is break this thing down, you know?
Simplify this shit for these stupid ass niggas out here
‘Cause you know niggas is stupid, son
So we gon’ do this shit like this, son
(Alchemist) Ayo…

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
You would wanna respect my team, it’s no dream
Guns with the blue beam, we tear apart things
Body parts get ripped, clothing get torn
When you see my niggas battle, fuck down, it’s on
Right now in the presence of thugs, my flesh and my bone
Will be the proof we still living this, homes
Don’t make me have to show my grizzly, for getting busy
Like Cousin Craig caught them bodies at Wendy’s
No liquor could amp me up with drugs and such (You know)
I’m naturally born for this, dunn
Rap with killers, about murders that took place
Laugh with bananas niggas about homicides and things
Watch out now, pardon my chain
I know my shit bulky, but it’s just part of my game
Jewelry like the Juice Crew in the ‘80s, mad weight
My niggas is untouchable, you can’t eat

[Hook: I-20]
Real niggas feel niggas when it comes to the beef
It be the Mobb and y’all niggas know who running the streets
We give a fuck, do what you must to survive
‘Cause the beast is hungry and these streets’ll eat you alive
Real niggas feel niggas when it comes to the beef
It be the Mobb and y’all niggas know who running the streets
We give a fuck, do what you must to survive
‘Cause the beast is hungry and these streets’ll eat you alive

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Yo, it’s that real shit, shit to make ‘em feel shit, true
Most of my niggas is guerrillas, they career criminals
The foulest individuals that you would ever cross paths with
Think of it as a blessing if you only get that ass kicked
I got a vision, most of y’all niggas too short-sighted to see it
Start a riot then leave it
Like Sealy Posturepedic, I lay ‘em down with that four-fever
Fuck your favorite diva, have her going ‘round and ‘round
I know you love the way it’s going down
Mobb is back up in this bitch, muthafucka, what now?
The H-A-V-the O-the C
That’s word to me, y’all niggas is pussy
In need of a tampon, niggas’ll be bleeding heavy
Know that thing’ll tear his ass to confetti
Put him to beddy, know my gangsta overflows the levee
Call in the National Guard way my flow so deadly, nigga
(Shit is deadly, son) Yeah, you heard me, nigga
Havoc’s too much, skills is unearthly, nigga

[Hook: I-20]
Real niggas feel niggas when it comes to the beef
It be the Mobb and y’all niggas know who running the streets
We give a fuck, do what you must to survive
‘Cause the beast is hungry and these streets’ll eat you alive
Real niggas feel niggas when it comes to the beef
It be the Mobb and y’all niggas know who running the streets
We give a fuck, do what you must to survive
‘Cause the beast is hungry and these streets’ll eat you alive

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
As I take big pulls from the back of the spliff
Looking at everything around me, I itch
For a nigga to step from under they rock with dumb shit
Niggas see us, dunn, they better humble up quick
They wanna cut at me, they better hit something
Bullets hitting my Jeep just ain’t gon’ be enough, man
You niggas is babies compared to my thug
Y’all niggas talk too much, they snitching on us

[Interlude: I-20]
Yeah, First Infantry, Mobb Deep
Mr. I-20, Disturbing Tha muthafuckin’ Peace
IM3, my nigga Alchemist
For all you studio gangstas talking real thorough on wax

[Hook: I-20]
Real niggas feel niggas when it comes to the beef
It be the Mobb and y’all niggas know who running the streets
We give a fuck, do what you must to survive
‘Cause the beast is hungry and these streets’ll eat you alive
Real niggas feel niggas when it comes to the beef
It be the Mobb and y’all niggas know who running the streets
We give a fuck, do what you must to survive
‘Cause the beast is hungry and these streets’ll eat you alive
