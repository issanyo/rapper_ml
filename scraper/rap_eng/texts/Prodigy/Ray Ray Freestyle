[Verse 1: Ray Ray]
Im not perfect but this life is worth it
Im on to new ways, im crowd surfing
I look back and I ask why
When you was 13 did you take a flight to NY?
And when they say no, then I ask and why?
And after while.. there's no reply, no reply, no reply
I want them to look back and see what I bought
What I brought,they making soft money its softy lost
Making hard money, Its hard to gain
Im steady thinking hard but my thoughts come out soft
And yes I was tempted
I was tempted for the game, temptation
Im study chill, but my heart's steady racing..
