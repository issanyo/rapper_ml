[Verse 2]
Once upon a time in the drought off a golly street
Trakin down a dudeplex a hundred guns a hundred deals
Hit me on the phone sayin he tryna get a four way
Ask if I can cook it up say he met me half way
I was kinda rushen em just thinkin I'mma bustem up
I'mma charge em 30 20 grams gonna be short as fuck
Ridin down a back street lookin in my rear view
Notice someone followin me once I pass him
So I smashed on that gas doin that dash in that hot persute
Janky ass renta cop mothafuckin mona duke
I threw my phone into a car pole I don't know what to say
House wired neighbors snichen I don't know where to stay

[Hook]
I always feel like somebody's watch in me
(watchin me)
They keep on hatin but it don't bother me
(bother me)
Keep it movin movin this is what we do with the money we persuin they mad cause they losin they losin
I always feel like somedody's watchin me
(watchin me)
