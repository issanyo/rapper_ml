[Verse 1]
You want an ounce?
Nigga, meet me at the back gate
Pull up, cut ya car off
Never sipped lean in the first place
'Cause I ain't never wanna nod off
I was cooking cocaine getting hard off
A .25 and a sawed-off
8 dimes for the 80
Hope and foreign, the baby
Put a pound, hot nigga
Head to start off

[Chorus]
(Back gate!)
Pumping like a motherfucker (back gate!)
Jumping like a motherfucker (back gate!)
Get money like a motherfucker (back gate!)
We robbin' like a motherfucker (back gate!)
Pull up at your own risk (back gate!)
Knowing we were with the shit (back gate!)
Tryna down a lot of bricks (back gate!)
Lot of niggas got hit (back gate!)

[Bridge]
Ay, I'm talkin' 'bout
That back gate made a nigga
I seen that same back gate break niggas
You wanna fish a nigga, I advise you stay on top

[Verse 2]
Lost nigga in through the back gate (back gate!)
Trap came fucked up the crime rate (back gate!)
Old head fucked up my mind state
Watch him killing me cold blood in the broad day
If I ain't know God I would've lost faith
Niggas couldn't eat while they lost weight
Niggas ain't going on no diet
Niggas kill a nigga by they pride
Niggas gon' slide
Niggas gon' do 25 in a cell for' a nigga switch sides
You can see it in my eyes
That's pain, lost niggas to the game, and ain't the same
Did it for the check, I ain't do it for the fame
Only time you shot a pistol is at the motherfucking range
You a pussy if you gotta close your eyes for' you aim

[Chorus]
(Back gate!)
Pumping like a motherfucker (back gate!)
Jumping like a motherfucker (back gate!)
Get money like a motherfucker (back gate!)
We robbin' like a motherfucker (back gate!)
Pull up at your own risk (back gate!)
Knowing we were with the shit (back gate!)
Tryna down a lot of bricks (back gate!)
Lot of niggas got hit (back gate!)

[Verse 3]
Told the plug meet me at the bottom (back gate!)
Showed me two bricks and I shot him (back gate!)
First time I ever did a robbery (back gate!)
Ever since then they been hard for me
I'ma cut throat nigga's arteries (back gate!)
I shouldn't be trusted properly
Reach Chris turned me to a savage
Used to couldn't flip on a pissy ass mattress (back gate!)
I know a lot of killers is activing
Know a lot of rappers that's active
Used to get my work from the plug I was paying on the backhand
That was back then when I was trapping
First time I ever shot a pistol I was 13
Glock hold 17, black with the red beam
First time I ever shot a nigga, rival hood shoot-out shit
Feeling like a wet dream, fell in love with the streets
Got a couple choppers, fell in love with the beef (back gate!)
Got a couple bricks and we all gon' leave (back gate!)
Back gate jumping like the coddle (back gate!)
Ain't no other hood trapping harder (back gate!)
Saved a hunnit thou when I was 16
I was moving bricks by the 16
That millimeter hold 16
Turned the back gate to a crime scene

[Chorus]
(Back gate!)
Pumping like a motherfucker (back gate!)
Jumping like a motherfucker (back gate!)
Get money like a motherfucker (back gate!)
We robbin' like a motherfucker (back gate!)
Pull up at your own risk (back gate!)
Knowing we were with the shit (back gate!)
Tryna down a lot of bricks (back gate!)
Lot of niggas got hit (back gate!)
