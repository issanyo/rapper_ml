[Intro: MoneyBagg Yo]
Ayy true story fool
I ain't got no reason to lie
Ayy I really did that
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
Hottest nigga in the city, no features
Bought the Aston plain janes
Ain’t like that, had to add some features
When them young niggas hungry they’ll eat you, they creatures
Went and iced out me a few pieces off shows and features
Shawty ass fat, long hair, she got features
Had to cut 'em off, had to stop fucking with 'em, they were leeches

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
Hottest nigga where I’m from
Zach Randolph can vouch for me
Couple labels, they done called for me
Then Gotti done called for me (CMG)
Then I turned up at birthday bash
All my fans was going crazy for me
Plenty guns, face on the news
Then I thought shit was going bad for me
They were ballin’, I was in the bleachers watching
Came up on my own, how you gonna knock me?
Now I’m hot, on the stove, bricks I'm poppin'
Meanwhile, yeah your favorite rapper floppin'
Diamonds dancing, Chris Breezy
Lay up, yeah your bitch was easy
She say I fuck better on them tabs
Popped one, and left that pussy leaking
Fucked her like I was still squeaking
White emoji what she tweeted
My lil nigga 'nem be tweaking
You can get hit just for reaching
Cashed out on both of my vehicles, no leasing
I fuck with MoneyBagg Yo for a reason (why?)
He be preaching (amen)

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
Hottest nigga in the game, no features
Bought the Lamb plain jane, 500K, no features
Hit the bitch from the back, 'til she start shaking, seizures
Sucked the dick all night till I fall asleep, she got features

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Nigga used to sell reefer
Then I started selling ether
If that ass real there’s no features
Yeah that bitch bad, but I’ll never eat her
She respectin' how I treat her
Gangsters respect how I greet em
'Cause when I’m in they city, wanna hold me down
Just give me instructions, I don’t need 'em
Always mobbin' with my people
Young niggas ready to ride for me
Don’t be talking tough in public
Then run and go hide from me
Kilo Cuban all gold, no features
Bitch going through your phone, police her
First time I got head (seventh grade, who?) Naiesha
First time you got caught, homeboy snitch, ain’t teach him
Hottest nigga in the city, richest nigga in the hood
Realest nigga in the game
You paying for feature, you paying for the name


[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo & Yo Gotti]
Hottest nigga in the city, no features
Bought the Aston plain janes
Ain’t like that, had to add some features
When them young niggas hungry they’ll eat you, they creatures
Went and iced out me a few pieces off shows and features
Shawty ass fat, long hair, she got features
Had to cut 'em off, had to stop fucking with 'em, they were leeches
Hottest nigga in the game, no features
Bought the Lamb plain jane, 500K, no features
Hit the bitch from the back, 'til she start shaking, seizures
Sucked the dick all night till I fall asleep, she got features
