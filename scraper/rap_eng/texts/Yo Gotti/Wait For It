[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Yeah
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
Wanna come but can't wait for it
Head shot can't run from it
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
Pussy come can't wait for it
Pussy good, I'll pay for it
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it (wait)
Wanna come can't wait for it
Head shot can't run from it
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it (Wait)
Wanna come can't wait for it
Pussy good, I'll pay for it

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Got the pussy first night, heard she told you you had to wait for it
Got the pussy on the stretcher, heard she told you you had to pay for it
Big ole mansion need the grass cut, neighbors volunteered to pay for it
Just a rich ass trap nigga parked the wraith in the front yard
I be fucking with the bad bitches, good credit she could pay for it
I ain't fucking with the lay-away-hoes type of bitch she gotta wait for it
Shorty trying get my number, told the hoe she gotta wait for it
Trying fuck on a real nigga, told the bitch she gotta wait for it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Blac Youngsta

All my bitches feisty, All my niggas shiesty's
All i do is shoot dices, I might take a nigga life's
I remember i was broke as fuck sleeping on the floor with the mice's
Gotta go and see these preacher cause i ain't living righteous
Know these niggas wanna crate me, cause they really don't like me
I ain't 2PAC but im on death row, i ain't Suge Knight but im real cut throat
Everybody lay down on the dam floor, and you better not move or you going get hurt
I'll see your grand mama at the front door, BET awards rich nigga front row!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gotti}
Rollie on without the time set, on my young nigga mind set..
She ain't fuckin i dont mind that, but if she ain't fucking i ain't buying it
New whip indoor, outdoor Shout out to Jay my mentor
Might sign bricks at the ??... me and the plug so tight he moved next door
When you plugged in with the cartel you ain't never gotta wait for it
I just ran up another $5 mil i ain't even got space for it
Therefore, hate more. i ain't trippin, i ask for it. too turnt, white aventador, say you gettin money, im waitin for it
