[Chorus:]
Cause she looking for a come up
All she really want is my millions
Man she looking for a come up
You don't think I know but I know
Yea she looking for a come up
She looking for a come up
She looking for a come up
She looking for a come up

[Verse 1:]
She a star she work at Starlets
She get money cause she bartending
Give these hoes they trophies these hoes winning
Get more money than niggas they riding Bentleys
Looking for a come up and done it
Memorial Weekend in Vegas she made a 100
Magic City Mondays or DOA
Catch me down at Follie's when Im in the A
She stay in North Beach around the plug
She work at KOD the Office too
And this her art of hustle so you can't knock her hustle

[Chorus:]
Cause she looking for a come up
All she really want is my millions
Man she looking for a come up
You don't think I know but I know
Yea she looking for a come up

[Verse 2:]
She a stripper, exotic dancer
Get that money she got her bands up
She go to college a 4 year plan bruh
She raise her son without a man bruh
She on the come up she independent
You niggas losing these bitches winning
You niggas boring she riding foreign
She stacking money for her first born
Fuck a broke nigga it's downgrade for real
Real niggas will motivate you for real
She just looking for a come up
So that money she gon run up

[Chorus:]
Cause she looking for a come up
All she really want is my millions
Man she looking for a come up
You don't think i know but i know
Yea she looking for a come up
She looking for a come up
She looking for a come up
She looking for a come up
