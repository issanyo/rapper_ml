[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Come get you what you want maybe front you one
If you're cool front you two let you do what you do
Ain't no drugs without a plug that's like a plate without the grub
Like a hood without the fuzz like a nose without the snub
Nothin' snappin' nothin' poppin' no connect then ain't no profit
Damn dawg I whipped it hard, can't go back and soften it
It's a drought, nothing 'round, not a pound looking awful
Not a brick, Not a nick, clack click it's time for office
Now my fool just threw me four, got some good news for my folk
Took that trip, hit that road, dirty far from 54
I'm a hustler, the definition of a thug nigga
Drug life, and this my definition of a plug nigga

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
My definition of a plug is a Mexican
Put the work in the gas tank and ship it in
There's different kinds of plugs because I'm a plug myself
10 brick minimum, I was really dealing 'em
Plug gold chains gold watches I'm a dope boy
I get that sack a pass it off to old boy
Definition of a bitch is a rat nigga
So they would never ever ever do that nigga
House smelling like yayo taste that residue
Got a million out the streets, who'd ever knew?
Talking UPS, the way it travel mint
I'm talking FedEx to keep it 'round me

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
Fuck a definition pussy nigga I got pigeons
But the kitchen lookin' like a scaled a thousand fishes
Junkies itchin' bitchin', ain't seen a decent rock in months
Now they back to rollin' reefer, picture crackheads crackin' blunts
This the dope game baby got the whole thing with me
Dope dollars no blood stains came with it
Time's money, whip an eighth is eight minutes
The white team winning won the game in eight innings
They know I throw narcotics so they knock on my door harder
Got a starter kit now to start another Carter
I'm a hustler, the definition of a thug nigga
Drug life, and this my definition of a plug nigga

What's your definition fool?
