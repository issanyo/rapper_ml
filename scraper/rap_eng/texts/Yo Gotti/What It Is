[Hook x2: Bohagon & Yo Gotti]
You motherfuckers knows the score
Plenty hoes, plenty dro
And you already know what it is!
Bitch drop it to the floor
Bend it over, touch your toes
And you already know what it is!

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Red chrome do the phones
With the Lamborghini doors
I'mma sell a niggas hoes on the real
I made 45 large after sellin' too hard
Put 25 thousand in my grill
You can catch me in the club
Showin' 'em real gangsta love
Try'na get a bitch full of them pills
I'm talking naked ladies, smiley faces
Triple stack, blue dolphins shoot the bitch straight to my crib
What it do? Who I is?
Yo gotti, Hagon (I am trill)
So intelligent, shawty says she celibate
[?] on the bed, that's the real evidence
Yeah she a freak with it
Shawty so unique with it
Skeet it in her mouth
And she talkin' 'bout you keepin' it
Head game foreal, left a nigga with the chill
Fix her nails, pay her bill
Bo, why don't you these hoes what it is!

[Verse 2: Bohagon]
Haha, you know who it is!
I'm a fool, I've accepted this
Diamond in my necklaces
Jacqueline High
24" when I roll by
Hagon leave the haters on the side line heckling
My pimpin is immaculate
Hard like Calculus, and after this'
Over you gonna see what the fuck I mean
See me in your Beamer, see me on the big screen
I sell a bitch a big drink cause that means bread
She super bad plus I know that she's in
I'm done dictating songs, cause that means bad
Try'na get that pop belly, cause that means it
If you attending to coward shit, that means scared
I'm a hustla first and foremost, and that means it
IT'S BOHAGON AND YO GOTTI!
