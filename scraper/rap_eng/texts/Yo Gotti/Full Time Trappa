Hail to the witness, jail is a business, bail is a business (Work)
Death is a business, stress is a business, thats how the business (Work)
And I need a hundred k, I need it andele, I need the phantom to push on a summer day
Baltimore city where niggas is unafraid I need to get it and never be under paid
Don't want me have it then we need to run a fade need god to answer the shit that my momma pray

No sleping on a giant cause im woke now
