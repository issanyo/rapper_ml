[Hook: Canei Finch]
Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, but how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
In a nigga, yeah, no love in a nigga
If I could paint a picture, I'd show a image
Of a dog ass nigga, yeah, a raw ass nigga
Popping pain killers, riding for the cause
Four dogs with them pistols, na-na-natural born killers
He sold crack to his mother, turned his back on his brothers
Killed his partner for the plug, he think everything a hustle
Co-cold mu'fucka, holmes numb
Black heart, no feelings, just a gun, fo'real
He was raised in the trenches
Not to mention all the hoes that had dissed him
So holmes think the whole world against him
Played ball, coach benched him, grandpa, Klan lynched him
He was raised in Mississippi but he moved up to Memphis
Kinda hard to adapt
So holmes turned to a strap
Didn't succeed, tried rap, couldn't fight, got slapped
Shot dice, do crap, did time, back out, damn

[Hook: Canei Finch]
And from the ground, we build it to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
It’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga
Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, no love, no love
How you gon' survive now? No love, no love
Yo Gotti, lemme paint a picture for these niggas, hey, huh
Here’s a voice for the voiceless
My words like multiple choice to the choiceless
Emerge like a searchlight in the darkness for this young black carcass
My niggas either join the Armed Forces or they corpses now
In God we trust, but it’s bucks that we worship now
Boy, that root of evil gon’ forever rule the people
See I seen just what that fast money gon’ come and do to people
Hit a lick, it was a hit, he said, “Let's go and do the sequel”
But his, nigga wasn’t ‘bout it, nigga wasn’t ‘bout it now
Feeling guilty, what would momma think about me?
Told 'em, "Think about it, nigga, won't you think about it now?"
But he was money hungry, plus he trigger happy
So they hopped up in the Caddy, burners packed just like a stadium
Thirty minutes later, blood is leaking at the ATM
Momma in denial, like her baby boy on trial
For a murder that he ain’t commit, tears soak the handkerchief

[Hook: Canei Finch]
And from the ground, we build it to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
It’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga
Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Fo'real, fo'real
Lights off, no candles, roaches all around the kitchen
Nigga hungry, mom embarrassed so she don't want us to mention it
Grandma wanna help but momma ego kicking in
She a hustler, she don’t need no help raising her kids
Bills came, got evicted, stayed strong
Square business, she ain’t never shown weakness, real shit
That created the hunger, and that make the monsters
Got the game from our momma, that’s some ill shit
Thirteen on the block, he was a lookout
In the kitchen, on the stove like it’s a cookout
Young nigga doctored the game, could put a book out
Right when he thought it was over he got took out
Brains leaking, nigga sneaked him, he ain't even seen it coming
He a hitta, he wasn't focus so he died over nothing
No revenge, with his friends shooting dice
Bet again, win or lose, take it all, took out by his own men

[Hook: Canei Finch]
And from the ground, we build it to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
It’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga
Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Outro: J. Cole]
They say the good die young, that’s the truth
My nigga floating up in Heaven now, and that’s the proof
I ain’t make it to the funeral, but homie rest in peace
If this world get too cold, I hope one day you rescue me
Nigga, maybe we can fly someday
Oh, we can fly someday
Yeah, up in the sky someday
Do real niggas get to Heaven? That’s that shit I ask the reverend
They say the good die young, that’s the truth
My nigga floating up in Heaven now, and that’s the proof
I ain’t make it to the funeral, but homie rest in peace
If this world get too cold, I hope one day you rescue me
Nigga, maybe we can fly someday
Oh, we can fly someday
Yeah, up in the sky someday
Do real niggas get to Heaven? That’s that shit I ask the reverend
