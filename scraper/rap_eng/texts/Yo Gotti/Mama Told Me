Mama told me , yeah she told me
These fuck niggas ain't your homie
Watch how niggas change up , they change up
That's why I keep one in the chamber
Cause im gone take one with me
Yeah im gone take one with me

[Verse 1 - Yo Gotti]
Shout out to my mama , cause she didn't raise no ho
She said boy if you gone be thug , you gone be thuggin fasho
You ain't gone snitch on nobody , you ain't gone fall out about hoes
And if them niggas your partner , you gone stick with your woes
Mama scrubbed me and warned me
Said once you get your money best son get your army
And you gone keep one with you ( what you talking about mum ? )
Boy im talking about that pistol ( oh , that's that gangsta shit )
I was thugginin in public , half a quarter im rocking
Tryna get to a a brick , so I tryna stack up my profit
Call the plug , cause im copping
Old school chevy , im dropping
We straight mafia mobbing
Play with the hood and im trapping

[Hook]
Mama told me , yeah she told me
These fuck niggas ain't your homie
Watch how niggas change up , they change up
That's why I keep one in the chamber
Cause im gone take one with me
Yeah im gone take one with me

[Verse 2 - Zed Zilla]
Ima stay the same Zilla , they old me
Even though I saw these lame niggas that owe me
And ima always do what mama told me
She told me trust no bitches mind , & watch my homies
Slowly , but surely
Nigga I grind it up , & cop that rollie
And these niggas with they bitch ways , they showed me
I seen a BG , get gunned down by his OG
Bitch niggas treating thot bitches like they trophies
Nigga ima tell you like my mama told me
Nigga wear a rubber , yeah
She told me fuck these bitches don't you love them , & these niggas undercover

[Hook]
Mama told me , yeah she told me
These fuck niggas ain't your homie
Watch how niggas change up , they change up
That's why I keep one in the chamber
Cause im gone take one with me
Yeah im gone take one with me
