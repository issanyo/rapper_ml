[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Everyday you see me  boy I'm fresh as hell
Brand new purple J's don't work itselfs
Don't wear cologne I smell like cream
I’m from the US but my swag from overseas
I'm killin' bitches on my instagram
She like my pics and she dressy who I am
I like her pics, I like her too
They say she a model bitch I wouldn't never knew
I be fucking bad hoes
I’m turnt up far as swag goes
At the top it's just us nigga
I'm paranoid I don’t really trust niggas

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
If you ask me if I've seen anything I won't tell nobody
And I got a couple secrets that I can't tell nobody
Besides my mama fuck these bitches cause I don't love nobody
On my hip is where I keep it cause I don't trust nobody
Thou shall fear no evil, and never trust nobody
But I will ride for your people you can never trust nobody
Watch out for them niggas who keep a close eye on them bitches
I don't know why I'm feeling like this, but I can't trust nobody
I can’t trust nobody

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Trust is hard to get nigga, squad the mall with my hitters
Ridin around with all my niggas, y'all already know I ain't no killer
I rock 'Sace with the Margielas, half a mill in little pillows
Damn show feel good to be gettin' money with my niggas
Who ever ride with the team, they ain't without the beam
Keep the J's 'fore they hit the streets, hundred bands in my jeans
Never talk what I've seen, bitches don’t mean shit to me
These niggas don’t mean shit to me, all this money might get to me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snootie Wild]
Trust nothing but god, oh lord
Who fake in my squad, oh lord
Hit it by the cross from my mob, oh lord
I'm gone catch a body
Bitch, I'm gone catch a body
Porsche push retarded, hit the club it's sparkin'
CMG the takeover, CMG the party
Goons all on the dancefloor don't become a target
Chickens in the minivan show you where I parked it

[Hook]
