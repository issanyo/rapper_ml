[Intro]

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
They smiling in your face
All the time, they wanna take your place
Fake ass executives, trying to take care of my relatives
‘cause I’m out here on my grind and they won’t playing ball with me
Then I ... out that sack, then they start calling for me
Hello
These meeting is gonna set up your family for the rest of your life
Mister Gotti, we’re looking forward to doing everything with you in the future
Bitch I'm in these streets and I’m locked in
Critics saying I’m boxed in
Fuck all commercial, I'd rather flock ...,
I'll never change, I got blocks then
Hip hop, you need a flip flop, best albums, night grams
Whoever hot, you wanna do a song with
What's not something wrong with
Where the real niggas, where real gangstas
Who staying for something, I hear... for something
Told you that won’t find me strong, niggas must thought I was playing or something

They smiling in your face
They smiling in your face
They smiling in your face
They smiling in your face
