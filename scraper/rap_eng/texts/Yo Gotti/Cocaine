[Chorus]
Cocaine
Forget it by the quarter
Bring it by the pound, straight through the border
Cocaine
Bring it 'cross the water
When it touch down, serve it on the corner

They taste it, they taste it they coming right back
Coming right back, yeah they coming right back
You taste it, you taste it, you coming right back
Coming right back yeah you coming right back fo' da
Cocaine

[Verse 1: Twista]
This for them white girl movers
Big dreams of making a million offa users
Car and the money the same color of mucus
Go get it his self they call 'em ghetto Frank Lucas
Cocaine
He got it by the boulder
Got it by the bird and he got it by the quarter
Cocaine
So he keep one in the holster
Colombian connects, so they call him Lil' Sosa
Gotta try ta' catch the six o' clock morning rush
I bet them niggas down the street ain't serving more than us
They look like 20's but I'm charging the customer 10
They give-aways just to lure a few customers in
Cocaine
That’s why its Bentley Coupe time
Damn, them niggas tipping, look at the soup line
All day they be serving them 50 packs
Came to the table and count about 50 stacks
'Cos I know somebody who can come right over the border
That be the reason why they get it right back
And so they got...

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Twista]
This lil' nigga think he Pablo
The whole thing in the panel of the car door
Cocaine
And even though we from Chicago
Some kinda way he can get that overseas cargo
And if you stop the connection he got, then he has others
Twins from Miami, I call 'em the Diaz brothers
Got a killer squad, in the mob he the boss
How you want it? 'cos he got the hard and the soft
Cocaine
They call him Shawty Blanco
Junior El Chapo, in that Murcielago
Cocaine
That right connection to them poppy seeds
'Cos he know someone that'll go wherever poppy be
Cocaine
And no the knot don’t stop
'Cos these niggas is go get it from the doc to the block
And these tips gon' be open
And these hypes gon be floating
I don’t put too much on it, so it can stay potent
I got that...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
[?]
Y-O-G-O-TTI, fuck nigga play wit me get shot
Pow-pow-pow from a coupe to a drop BEEP
(cocaine) big guap, nigga 18 bands will get 1008 grams of that block
Fresh up out the pot, I call it water whipped
Hit it with the soda make that dope do a karate flip
Five turn to ten, now that’s a Maserati flip
240 months, now that’s a whole lotta years
M6 Camaro, now that’s a whole lotta gears
Hit him wit the choppa make his family shed alotta tears
I'm a North Memphis nigga, we weighed everything
Send them boys in Chi-town they like to gang bang
[?] know the flo' do too
Nigga, imagine what I been through
Shawty shot at niggas who, went to war wit me & my crew
Gotti them niggas ain't pimp like you, they ain't real like you, they ain't trill like you
They ain't selling no bricks, they ain't shot no pistol, niggas ain't on a song wit Twista
Hey...
I'm Yo Gotti!

[Chorus]
