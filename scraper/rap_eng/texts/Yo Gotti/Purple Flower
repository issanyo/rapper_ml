[Verse: 1 Yo Gotti]
First of the month, the trap be jumping like a Gotti show
Strapped up shawty goons on deck everywhere that Gotti go
Long hair, super fine, she must be a Gotti ho
Two mil' for the deal, yeah, that's that new Bugatti flow
House look like a mini mall, driveway like a dealership
Niggas from Afghanistan they got them banana clips
Yellow gold Rolley watch yelling that Ferrari drop
Pulled up with my shirt off up in 48 the parking lot
V-neck and my true's on, sipping on that Don P
Walking like on Mardi Gras, yeah, I ride 100 deep
Hundred deep, hundred bands, had to fuck a hundred freaks
Understood you know be fucking and sucking to get in the club with me
Let me see you represent your hood, twist your fingers up
Pistols in the club and we gonna bang, we don't give a fuck
Bottles of champagne, doing my thing, time to celebrate
Haters looking mad across the room, fuck it, let 'em hate

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Purple flowers, fuck boy, you a coward
My shades five bands, my shoes 'bout a thousand, my t-shirt 600
I'm standing on the couches
Purple flowers, fuck, boy, you a coward
My shade's five bands, my earrings fifty thousand, my t-shirt 600
I'm standing on the couches, purple flowers
I'm sipping on purple flowers, I said you be purple flowers
And I fucked that bitch for an hour

[Verse:2 Yo Gotti]
Ima Rob Gotti when I see him, suicide attempt,
Balling on the niggas, pull so doping, bitch, I'm sure to kill
Pull up in that 'rarri 360, bitch, I'm dominique
Bullets doing the fucking windmill when that Yoppa speak
All I do is ball, nigga, all I do is turn it up
Let you niggas wife these hoes all I do is burn it up
I set appointment in the back of the lab
Then I got on the phone, my niggas took over my mind
Money took over my future, bitch, I'll pull up in that thing for life
I'm back in the future and I got the niggas there to shoot you
Smoking purple that super, we're rocking, suck it, medusa
Us, real niggas is the rock, play with me and I'll do you

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Purple flowers, fuck boy, you a coward
My shades five bands, my shoes 'bout a thousand, my t-shirt 600
I'm standing on the couches
Purple flowers, fuck, boy, you a coward
My shade's five bands, my earrings fifty thousand, my t-shirt 600
I'm standing on the couches, purple flowers
I'm sipping on purple flowers, I said you be purple flowers
And I fucked that bitch for an hour

[Outro]
Purple flowers, purp, purp, purple flowers
Purp, purp, purple flowers
Purp, purp, purp, purple flowers
Purple flowers, purp, purp, purple flowers
Sipping on purple flowers
And I'm blowing on purple flowers
