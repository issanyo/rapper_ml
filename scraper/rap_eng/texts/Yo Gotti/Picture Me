Picture me rolling, top drop to the sunset
Mind on the billion, some shit I ain't done yet
No more thinkin bout me, 'cause I've already done that
Life of a dope boy,where my sac and my gun at
Look in the mirror, see my reflection salute back
Homie had a strap, the niggas shot, he ain't shoot back
Off with his head, homie, no, we don't play that
And never keep that work in the house where you're lay at
Finessin my recipe, winning my destiny
Missing my home boys and they get the best of me
Feel like I'm walking with angels, get money with strangers
The life of a screen name, it's got a bangle
In love with her down, but she's still a hoe
I'm still a nigga, so you know how it goes
Try not to look at her friends, try not to play her in public
But it is what it is if she leaves then fuck it

It's 2012, a long way from 1999
A young nigga from Ridgecrest with a Glock 9
I remember one time, more than one time
At the school in 2009, in the lunch line
I was hustling and grinding like a motherfucker grown man
Sixteen years old, paying the bills, I'm a grown man
Now I'm hustling while my brother doing jail time
Wrote him a letter, tryna give a nigga fed time
But the strong survive, ain't no bitch in my blood line
On the hood they want, and nigga I'm on the gun line
This life ain't about choices, and niggas got vices
But I'm slanging this work like a nigga got license
Put these hoes on the roll, 'cause the bitches be trifling
Cut the lights in the club, yeah, the nigga be icey
Niggas talking in codes, I'm just listening for prices
I keep one in the head cuz these niggas be shiesty
And that's real
