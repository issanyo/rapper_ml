[Intro: Yo Gotti]
Chea! Ayo
Ay, you know what it is, shawty

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Maybe, maybe it's the money, baby, maybe not
Maybe I fell in love with ya on the spot, never lie
I keep it G, I told you that there off the top
Maybe you never met a street nigga thuggin' on the block
And I ain't fuckin' with no thot shawty
Powerball, this your shot shawty
And if they hatin' let them talk, shawty
And I been drinking too much, and it got me thinking too much
You in my head what the fuck

[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
I say boy you done did it, love how you kiss it
Ooh you can get it, I never felt like that before
Ooh, you the realest, yeah, I admit it
All in my feelings

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Had to pause, nigga wait a minute
Almost tapped out when you started swimmin'
A little cocky, I can deal with that
Cause you put it down and I need parts of that
Just text your phone nigga Where you at?
Give me rounds, I need all of that
Ain't even gotta knock, left the door unlocked
So is you tryna take it down or nah? Or nah?

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Maybe it's the liquor, maybe it's the song
Don't know what it is, but you turn me on
Maybe it's the bar, maybe it's the car
Don't know what it is, maybe I'm in love

[Verse 3: Teyana Taylor]
In the club twisted, ooh, reminiscing
Boy, I can vision round two
It's me and you and I'm winning, it's no competition
Boy, you about to, uhh

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Had to pause, nigga wait a minute
Almost tapped out when you started swimmin'
A little cocky, I can deal with that
Cause you put it down and I need parts of that
Just text your phone nigga Where you at?
Give me rounds, I need all of that
Ain't even gotta knock, left the door unlocked
So is you tryna take it down or nah? Or nah?

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Maybe it's the liquor, maybe it's the song
Don't know what it is, but you turn me on
Maybe it's the bar, maybe it's the car
Don't know what it is, maybe I'm in love

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
Who she seeing? Who she fucking on the low?
She kissing him, she kissing her, she one of those
Fuck is you? You TMZ, you Sandra Rose
That's little sis, I'm big bro, so let's go
Maybe it's the way I speak it
Know the spot, and how to reach it
When I meet your man, shake his hand
That's I'll keep our little secret
Wooo, no pillow talk, no kiss and tell
They countin' coins, my pockets deeper than a wishing well
She like ballers, she like Birkin buyers
She got a wild side, she like dope boys with a certain fire
That's me nigga, so that's me nigga
No if, ands, no maybes, so that's oui nigga

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Maybe it's the liquor, maybe it's the song
Don't know what it is, but you turn me on
Maybe it's the bar, maybe it's the car
Don't know what it is, maybe I'm in love

[Outro: Teyana Taylor]
Ooh ohh ooh
Maybe Iâ€™m in love
Ooh ooh ooh, damn
Had to pause nigga wait a minute
