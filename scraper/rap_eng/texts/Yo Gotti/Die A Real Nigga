Put me in a coffin
Moma ask my plug if dey some real killas

[Verse 2]
Im posted in da hood
I spose to be on promo
Label called and i ain't answer
I got bricks for the low low
The parot popular logo
Crime scene gun smoke
Drive by the homocide
Nigga what you down to die for
Deez niggas can't be trusted
Bitches ain't loyal
Side bitch ain't getten shit
My main bitch spoiled
I ain't turnin on my niggas
We ain't fightin over hoes
Ain't no bitches in my business
Got killaz on da road
Smokin in da villa
Double wrap da tape
36 oz
All i got is weight
Fell in love wit guns
Choppa wit da drum
Burie me a nigga
If dat day ever come

[Hook] x2
Imma die a real nigga
Imma die a real nigga
Imma die a real nigga
Imma die a real nigga
I ain't soft on deez hoes
I ain't cross on my folk
If da feds come and scoop me
My mouth stayin closed

So Imma die a real nigga
My mouth stayin closed
