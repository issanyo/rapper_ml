[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I need a motherfucking translator my plug is a Mexican
We talk so many numbers we put numbers into sentences
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen five
Price too high I won't buy
You can get a G off every key if you gon take the right
I'm from Dope City North Memphis nigga look it up
381 away with pots and pans and we just cooking up
And lame niggas try to imitate the swag but
The dope boy shit ain't got a price or a tag
You can't pay to be a gangster, them goons in your bushes
All the money in the world man I bet you're still a pussy
The whips bilingual, them bitches foreign
Lifeline to the streets I just keep it going

[Hook: Gucci mane]
The tats on my face tell my niggas who we be
The tats on my back show my bitches I'm a G
Translation one plus two equals three
More keys for you and more pounds for me
Translation calculation
Translation calculation
Abbreviation more money for me more money we see
Translation calculation
Translation calculation
Abbreviation more money for me more money we see, Gucci!

[Verse 2: Cartel MGM]
1008 grams of coca
Touched the dope first, it came straight from the border
Just 2 weeks to send the money back over
Gotta keep a strap gotta keep a big pistola
My team full of young bald headed Mexicans
Move a lot of dope then we do the shit again
Bricks too hot so I'm fucking with the meth
Everybody know Cartel about a check
If you ain't talking money then I don't speak your language
18 wheeler from Arizona full of cabbage
When it touch down my money gonna double up
Think about plying you get kidnapped and tied up

[Hook: Gucci mane]
The tats on my face tell my niggas who we be
The tats on my back show my bitches I'm a G
Translation one plus two equals three
More keys for you and more pounds for me
Translation calculation

Abbreviation more money for me more money we see

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I shit like Mr Toilet bitch I need a pooper scooper
I'm jumping out the jag like a fucking paratrooper
Quarter pound of kiss my ass half a bag of swag
So take an overdose of me and throw him in the trash
Young Cartel that's my migo, Yo Gotti that's my Vato
We pull up in them Lambos, a car show on east flatshoals
Birds came in tonight, them dirty birds call me [??]
On a burner like Ike turner
I love that good ol marijuana
That yay helped me paved the way
And I still got my plug translating abbreviate
BS on that bull shit, that Brick Squad Monopoly
All these bitches jocking me, cocaine that's my prodigy

[Hook: Gucci mane]
The tats on my face tell my niggas who we be
