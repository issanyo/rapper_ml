(Intro)
Hit! Whatcha know about a young rich nigga gettin’ money? Everybody come get hit
Whatcha know about a young rich nigga spend 17 hunnid on the set
I got new phone clip back then, I ain’t heard about shit
Fuck nigga, now I’m livin’

I’m just riddin’ through this seat, bumpin’ glizzy, poppin’ pills Countin’ money and thinkin’ bout the business, yeah
I luv my city, yeah, but when I think of Memphis Man
I think about my pussy ass niggas, yeah, my enemies
When I think about my past, down to my last
In the gettin’ shootin’ dice, fuck around and a bag
Jump on i-40 with a 40 in a brown bag
And a black Mac, hit it to the hood, bump it trap or die
If I die from trappin’, if I make it rappin’
If I don’t, if I call my Mexicans, get what I want
If I die my family good forever
Ya niggas gon’ be bitches fo’ eva

They say the rich die young where I’m from
The good die young where I’m from
They say the youngins turn guns where I’m from
Runnin’ around drums where I’m from
Done picture me this way
I see the hate on their face
And na na na na na
Gon’ grind fo’ betta days, to try to make it through the day
And na na na na na
Nigga, I made my own way
I came a long long way
I came a long long way
They say the rich die young where I’m from
The good die young where I’m from
The good die young where I’m from

I know a lotta people didn’t believe me, they wanna see me dead
I know they prayin’ I’mma die for it cuz they wanna see me lose
Nigga, the shit that happened ova night I really really went through
You don’t understand what I had to do, what I went through
What I had to lose
I done came a long way, nigga
I don’t know no way nigga
Nobody helped me, I done made my own way nigga
A hater been real, violence been sealed
Foreign whip to get in, I done cracked the windshield
Now a G can fix it, damn, picture me this way
All they eva did was hate
All they eva have was fake
