Verse 1: Yo Gotti
Picture me preforming in an orpheum
Or poor, living in the orphanage, damn
What my future hold? only God knows
That's why I'm staying prayed up, and ten toes
Down on these clowns mean-mug frowns turn em up side down
Let smoke out the pound of the kush
Presidential like bush, whoops I mean to Barack
Its a coupe but it dont drop
Hard top killa

For I let another nigga disrespect my niggas, my hood, my family, I kill 'em
Fuck em, I don't feel em, when the beat drops nigga, gets realer

Any niggas can get it, any niggas can die
Any nigga can front like they real, any nigga can lie
Any nigga can make some money, only ganstas' survive
And everybody can't be a gangsta but any nigga can try, killa
