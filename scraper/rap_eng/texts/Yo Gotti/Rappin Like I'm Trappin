I got drama on the beat and he be going crazy
Tell it in the streets, I see them G are navy
I hid a grip that's big, 'cause they don't want replace me
Been it for the show, I'm selling out lately

I'm rapping like I'm trapping, rapping like I'm trapping
Rapping, rapping like I'm trapping, I'm rapping like I'm trapping
Yeah, I've been going hard, know I can make it happen
Asking what I'm doing, I tell 'em I'm rapping like I'm trapping
I'm rapping like I'm trapping, rapping like I'm trapping
I'm rapping like I'm trapping, rapping like I'm trapping
Yeah, I've been going hard, know I can make it happen
Asking what I'm doing, I tell 'em I'm rapping like I'm trapping

Today gonna be a good one, one my niggas bug one
Younger in the hood, I want a break, so I took one
Begging on a cook one, promise I won't shoot one
Bitch, I've got a million, now I'm trying to get jump one
Had to build a team, know that is a good one
Looking for some more real niggas, but I ain't seen none
Rap your ass off, I'm a get my hands off
Let you play with me, I'm a blow your ears off
Lot of nigga rear me, think I'm any grand
Talking money, money, money, but you'll never see 'em shine
Pearls up in your town, rolling with your damn
Niggas say I'm hot, but bitch I think I'll clack

I'm rapping like I'm trapping, rapping like I'm trapping
Rapping, rapping like I'm trapping, I'm rapping like I'm trapping
Yeah, I've been going hard, know I can make it happen
Asking what I'm doing, I tell 'em I'm rapping like I'm trapping

These verses to it, I'm going hard, I say 'MW is still a car
You gotta look good for it, sure she ain't got no heart
The nigga's eggs, it's about feeling them, pussy, they feeling them
Niggas bad, bitches on 'em, baby on like souvenir

My studio is my track spot, bring it down, might trap hot
Early in the street roll, my note pad is my stash bar
I'm rapping like I'm shopping, my heels are just soppy
My boot is in my kitchen, my engineer is shuffling
I spit some, it's like whip, and I've got pirate's vision
Bad bitch, know I'm a bad bitch, I'm in the town, I had shit
My foundation established, probe niggas, I pass them
Real talking, I see mad chips, real talk, I see mad chips
Two hundred bands, five hundred more
I'm like the circus, I fuck the clowns
Baby, I'm a surf around, fuck around, marathon around the town

Investigation tapping niggas rating 'till it fucks a sneach
You the type that never says, shit was for your served bricks
I'm busy like the tap fro, stacking paper every day
This Friday like my afro, I got that bitch operate
A nigga stay down, if it could, that's what the block would say
In the club like highway, Patron over this club and pay
Stacking like I'm banging, bitch they hear me saying
The real niggas acting different when you gain the shit they're changing
I'm in the kitchen, rapping, in the loose, snapping
Whatever happens, happens, I'm just trapping like I'm rapping

I'm rapping like I'm trapping, rapping like I'm trapping
Rapping, rapping like I'm trapping, I'm rapping like I'm trapping
Yeah, I've been going hard, know I can make it happen
Asking what I'm doing, I tell 'em I'm rapping like I'm trapping
I'm rapping like I'm trapping, rapping like I'm trapping
I'm rapping like I'm trapping, rapping like I'm trapping
Yeah, I've been going hard, know I can make it happen
Asking what I'm doing, I tell 'em I'm rapping like I'm trapping
