[Intro]
Hey, Yamine.
Has anyone out there ever had that one person around you that won’t SHUT UP!
I want you to play this out loud, and tell them this is what I got to say

[Hook]
I tell all my haters “Shut it up”
Close it down “Zip It up”
Shut it up, shut it up,shut it up (shut it up, shut it up)
Zip it up, zip it up, zip it up (zip it up, zip it up)
Close it up, close it up, close it up (close it up, close it up)

Shut it up, shut it up, shut it up (shut it up, shut it up)
Zip it up, zip it up, zip it up (zip it up, zip it up)
Close it up, close it up, close it up (close it up, close it up)

[Verse 1]
One day I made a single (single) then I ate some Pringles (yummm)
12 left in the can (what) now I’m really Triggered (ooops)
Then I asked who did it (did it), they say it was that nigga (what)
Stop lying lil boy, before I shoot with this pistol (BAM!)
He said do it then (idiot) and dump him in the ben (bucket)
Then I said no, I’ll just hop up in my Benz (where it at though?)
Naw I’m just playing (playing) because I am your friend (buddies)
That was a warning right there, but next time I won’t play pretend (bars)
These haters always talking about my Four-fo (Blllllaaaaaaaawwwww)
And that is a no-no (whip it off)
If you have a problem with me then go call the po-po (OP)
I’m not trash, just shut yo mouth before you hit the floor (floor)

[Verse 2]
Isaac Got the friends and he never ever lends (lends)
Hop up in that Benz
Uncle William got them Tens (Jordans)
Stop talking about the cans
And about the bandz
I’m too broke and there’s no way I’ll play pretend (fake)
I’m raking and raking
And staking to staking
I’m not even stopping
Cuz I’m slacking and slacking
You better Shut yo mouth
Cuz I have an Auto-Matic
I’m talking about GTA V
Overwatch is for faggots (whaaaaaaat)
I-I-I-I-I gggot them figures with me all the time
Taylor Gang and Hustle Gang it ride or die
Let me in and I’ll make my raps worth yo time
Don’t cry Wiz or T.I. because they can’t shut up for mine
M-Mind yo own business
And stay in yo lane
The next time you rap about me
I’ll end your career just like T-Pain (Bye bye)
