[Intro: Children Singing]
Lala la la lala la la la
Lala la la lala la la la
Lala la la lala la la la
Lala la la lala la la la

[Chorus: Children & Yo Gotti]
I been 'round the world
Reppin' where I'm from (where I'm from)
Right back to my hood
Right back to the slums
Right back to my hood
Right back to my, where I'm from
Right back to the Crest
I been 'round the world
Reppin' where I'm from (where I'm from)
Right back to my trap
Right back to my slums

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I just left Dubai
I just left Hawai'i
I just left, I just left NY
Headed to M-I-A, hey
I just left the bank
Headed to LA
I just left all my dogs a plate
Put 'em on a plane
Passport, I just left UK
Hustlin' out the States
I got weight
Yah they call it freight
Hood call it yay, yay
I can prolly say that I ain't never took the stand
My lil, Asian bitch she do my feet she from Japan (ayy)

[Chorus: Yo Gotti & Children]
I been 'round the world
Reppin' where I'm from (where I'm from)
Right back to my hood
Right back to the slums
Right back to my hood
Right back to my gun
Right back to the Crest
Right back to my bunk

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Where you from Gotti (Gotti)
Why your hoes exotic (why)
Why your car foreign (skrt skrt)
What your jewelry doin' [?]
What your fashion be
Bitch why you askin' me (huh)
'Cause you a drug dealer
Why you look like fashion week
This outfit a half a brick and they come from Milan
I can't rock no skinnies, it won't hold my gun
I got a Chinese bitch a Chinese Uzi
Say her favorite rapper Lil Uzi
Told her I'ma put her on to Lil Boosie
Introduce her to the gangsta music

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
I been 'round the world representin' this drug life
2Pac, Outlawz, yah this Thug Life

[Chorus: Yo Gotti & Children]
I been 'round the world
Reppin' where I'm from (where I'm from)
Right back to my hood
Right back to the slums
Right back to my hood
Right back to my gun
Right back to the Crest
Right back to my bunk

[Outro: Yo Gotti & Children]
Lala la la lala la la la
Lala la la lala la la la
Lala la la lala la la la
Lala la la lala la la la
I been 'round the world
Reppin' where I'm from (where I'm from)
Right back to my hood
Right back to the slums
Right back to my hood
Right back to my gun
Right back to the Crest
Right back to my bunk
