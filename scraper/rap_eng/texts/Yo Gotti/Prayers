[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Real niggas don't argue
Rich niggas don't bargain
Choppers answer to the problems
Choppers answer to the problems
Haters gone and the plug came
I guess god answered my prayers
Stayed down 'til the money came
I guess god answered my prayers

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
Got my shirt off with my chains on
I'm street as hell, can't you tell?
Sent your money off, go and came back
And god answered your prayers
We in [?], me and CEO
On a private jet, 'bout to take off
I ain't really with the back and forth talk
50 in the Glock, Zach Randolph
Got up off my ass
Had to make sacrifices just to see my people rich
Lil nigga got some killers with me
I'm G'd up, I'm on my own dick
Nigga rich, that's a cold kit
She fucked your dog, that's a cold bitch
In the game like EA
Diamonds lemonade, no Minute Maid
Don't want to hear that you fuck with me now
Cause you ain't fuck with me when I was fucked up
Fucked around and ran my bucks up
Yeah my baby mama 'nem lucked up
God bless 'em nigga, amen
I got white neighbors where I stay man
I can see the money clear now
Spent a couple thou on some Ray Bans

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Real niggas don't argue
Rich niggas don't bargain
Choppers answer to the problems
Choppers answer to the problems
Haters gone and the plug came
I guess god answered my prayers
Stayed down 'til the money came
I guess god answered my prayers
Beefin' with me and you still living
God answered your prayers
You my baby mama and I'm a rich nigga
Guess god answered your prayers
You fucked up and hit a lick nigga
God answered your prayers
You in this rap shit and you a street nigga
God answered your prayers

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Stayed down 'til I came up
Watched a fuck nigga change up
We all thuggin', can't blame us
Don't need pussy niggas, they shame us
Guess [?] got all gangster
Once a nigga got famous
Don't get the shit twisted
20 million later, still gon' shoot that banger
Poppin' pills, going to sleep
Waking up, tryna deal with my anger
Fallin' out with my homeboys
Feel more comfortable 'round strangers
Pull the Lamb up to the clipboard
Got the jet waiting in the hanger
With a whole bunch of hood niggas with me
Ready to kill, how could you blame 'em?
Playin' with me and you still breathing
Well god answered your prayers
Know the game got layers
Fuck your bitch, that's a layup
Never catch a nigga later
Nigga better get his weight up
Play with me ain't safe bruh
Get your grandmammy's shit sprayed up

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Real niggas don't argue
Rich niggas don't bargain
Choppers answer to the problems
Choppers answer to the problems
Haters gone and the plug came
I guess god answered my prayers
Stayed down 'til the money came
I guess god answered my prayers
Beefin' with me and you still living
God answered your prayers
You my baby mama and I'm a rich nigga
Guess god answered your prayers
You fucked up and hit a lick nigga
God answered your prayers
You in this rap shit and you a street nigga
God answered your prayers
