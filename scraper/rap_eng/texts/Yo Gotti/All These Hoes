[Verse 1]
Don't fuck with a nigga like you
Cuz a nigga like you
Keep on fake shoes, you look like fool for a nigga like who?
Nigga like me

Niggas don't act like niggas like me
Niggas don't move like niggas like me
Bitches be like "that nigga ain't street"
That nigga ain't real, that nigga ain't right
That nigga don't bang, he ain't part of that life
That nigga ain't rich, that nigga been lyin'
That nigga ain't fly, that nigga ain't live

See, the difference is I'm a different nigga
You same lame around different killas
You came with her, I left with her
I'm up in her, you textin' her
You paid for it, I pass on it
Speed up, I gas on it
Drunk drive, I crash on it
Fly out, I passport it
All these hoes
Fuck with a nigga like me
Cuz a nigga like me, just really might be
The last real nigga they see
See!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

You can rich, bricks are a payday bitch
And I swear ain't shit gonna change, nigga
I be in the hood where the gangstas be
You a pussy nigga, you supposed to bleed
Type of niggas say we beefin' but you pressin' charges
Type of nigga gotta plug but [?]
I can see you in the club talkin' loud arguments
I'm the type don't say a word, I just start sparkin'
Bang! Bang! Bang, bang!
Hit all the targets
I'm forever thuggin' and my niggas [?]
Real niggas, this the lifestyle
I should get her digits, get her iced out

[Hook]
