Woo-Ah !

[Hook]
It’s a concrete jungle, filled with lions, tigers & bears
Animal instinct, they kill you if they smell fear
It’s a concrete jungle, ain’t none but lions around here
Rats and snakes nigga, they’ll get your ass 100 years
It’s a concrete jungle

[Verse 1 : Eldorado Red]
Red bottoms with the cheetah print
Chopper have your ass runnin' like a cheetah bitch
Whole lot of racks in my joint
They told the feds Red do numbs
Hop a ball & all them 20 summers
I don’t make no plays, I got runners
You ever play & I’ma kill your mama
Ain’t none but lions in my circle straight hunters
Mob me, we have minute hummers
Turnt up with that pack I do numbers
Blood thirsty bitches like the runners
She green eye, all she sees is money

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Yo Gotti]
Brand new Lamborghini, vented doors
You lookin' like prayin' on the pelatour
Yeah I’m turnt up to the max nigga
Still yellin' "Free Boosie" he won’t match nigga
I’m sellin' white, I’m sellin' trash nigga
Real king of memphis better ask nigga
Why they pussy wish to play with me
Real nigga take that to the grave with me
On my big war hate rat niggas
With my deal when it fall up pat nigga
I eat up the land, concrete jungle
Animal instinct you can feel the hunger !

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Eldorado Red]
My bitch look like a fox mane
You see that pussy blunt, it will make you faint
I pull up in that candy paint
Shit so wet, you gon' wanna drank
I’m sittin' on ford Giato, screamin' "Whoa Kemosabe"
You know ballin' is my hobby
In the jungle, everybody caught a body
Ain’t none but hitters in my circle nigga
And you know we keep the 30’s nigga
He went wild what you circle nigga
Police ass nigga!

[Hook]
