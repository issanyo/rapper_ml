Chorus(x2)

Back in 95
Got a pick da side
With them big guys
They seen it in my eyes
They had a lot of pies
Money to the vibe
I knew no betta but whateva i was down to ride
And neva asked about tha shit dat they owe me
Just did wat they showed me
Or did what they told me
The littlest nigga with tha biggest fuckin
Balls i was down for tha motha fuckin cause
Now i must say today im a rich cred veteran
Shot alot of niggas cuz i sold a lot of medicine
Did a lot of shit that you may think irrelavent
I masked on them rappers cuz they play with my intelligence
They had white when the price was cheapa
They hate the mel row
And now my brothers keepa
Alot of niggas may not think the same
Cuz they lame
They just rap they wasn't in tha game get it
