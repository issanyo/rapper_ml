[Chorus:]
Pure cocaine, pure cocaine x3
All i ever served out in these streets is pure cocaine

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Remember me cocaina you like my best friend
When I was down and fucked up you got my ass in
Far as I remember my nigga my life been full of pain
I posted up in the snow I stood out in the rain
I laid that white on the table i watch em catch a drain
I knew right then right there that I would never live the same
I'm like a bird myself nigga wrap me up and move me
I got a stamp in the middle the whole hood approve me
But you can't break me down (down) you gotta sell me whole (whole)
Its a drought on real niggas you already know
I'm that ether nigga that fish scale
You that oil base homie you don't cook well
I'm Yo Gotti the king and i got that young cash
New money in a mufuckin dufflebag
Old hundreds in a sour creme ruffles bag
Dope money bitch i keep a couple hundred stashed

Chorus x2

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Cocaina heavily cooking dope excessively
Heavy risk activity my god given ability
Hid the bricks in the 6 wait 'til they get low to ???
Shawty snort a lotta powder let her snort it off the bricks
Gucci mane the dope boy point me where the jays at
Heres a 50 slab watch my'74 to payday
Shawty want some hardball baby want some powder
I'm so high I see stone mountain
Gucci got the birds I ain't talking bout the Falcons
Gucci slanging birds also known as a dragon
Hundred pounds of mid-grade stash that in my magnum
Roll it to the country then them country boys I tax them
Gucci mane bastard cook that dope faster
Make that dope stretch like a 80 inch plasma
Coke stank dope stank smoking on my airplane
80 in the air mane bricks over here mane

Chorus x2

[Verse 3: Young Cash]
Yeah, I never thought I would be riding dirty on I-10 just re-up and flip again
Rent a car from enterprise license proof of insurance
Speed limit 65 so I'm going 62
Both hands on the steering wheel driving like a old lady do
Crackers pull me over they ain't got shit gotta let me dip
Purple haze is all I smoke but she couldn't make it on this trip
Usually keep a pistol too one in the chamber clip full
Not today on I-10 its nothing but me and Redbull
Collared shirt brown slacks looking like a business man
Bible on the passenger side yeah I'm a christian man
Yeah I pray to god let me get these bricks back lord
Please don't let these crackers try to search this lil ol' Honda accord
Shit I'm wide awake, I ain't sleepy so I ain't gon swerve
Told you I like to trap it when it rain I call em Thunderbirds
Im the only one touch the work so I know its uncut
Cause I don't move nothing but, nothing but, nothing but
