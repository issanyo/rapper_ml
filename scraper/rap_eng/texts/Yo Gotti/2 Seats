[Verse One]
Yeah, six figure, one top, two seats, four wheels
I might be gone off them pills
My whip's Gucci, got a whole lot of funds
My goon's Gucci, got a whole lot of guns
Top back, switching lanes, bet that bitch gon' give me brain
If she ain't, I ain't tripping, bitch, get out in the turning lane
White on white Lexus, that's my fish scale movement
When I was in the hood, I was cocaine moving
S550 like a Maybach's moving
I was an American Gangster before the movie
Yo Gotti, one nigga, two heaters
Purple by the litre, in my two seater

[Hook]
Two seats, it's two seats, one girl, and one me, yeah
She say she like it cause it got two seats, huh
New paint, new feet, and it's one me, two seats, it's two seats
Gucci Mane, Yo Gotti what it do, ye
Hoes love it when a nigga's got a two seats, two seats, it's two seats

My Lowenhart's is tearing up the asphalt, pulled up in a Jaguar
'08 Porsche Carerra, Testarossa, Murciélago, '08 this McLaren
Ferrari Spider, apple cider, call that bitch the fast one
Off white vet with the off white diamond, pulled up to the light, and stop
The rims be spinning backwards, two door Viper with rally stripes
Now she stops in traffic, A coupé on standing rims in '08
Boy, you need your ass kicked, the Viper come's with two seats
I call that bitch the cat truck, police tried to whip me over
So I drove it faster, six racks worth of hundreds on me
I don't keep a gas card, prototype twos-eat Camaro, East Atlanta NASCAR

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Guns on deck, fifty round my neck, one hundred's in the car
I die for my respect, car jack who, gone rob who, gone slap who
Bitch, I'll kill you, oh oh, them boys a fool, doing donut's in the Lam
Me, Yo Gotti, ask yo hottie, damn the doors gone, whip her body
Two seats, and not two heaters, we don't want to hurt nobody
Private party, act retarded, two seat '08 Maserati
