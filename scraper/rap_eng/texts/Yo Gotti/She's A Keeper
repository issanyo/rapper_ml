She's a keeper
[Hook: August Alsina]
She's a keeper, he don't know what to do
She's a keeper, I wanna be with, I wanna be with
She's a keeper, he don't know what to do with you
She's a keeper, he don't know what to do
Baby, you too bad and ya got all that ass
We both know that, I wanna be with
Cause she's a keeper babe, you the trillest for sure
Down to ride when I'm ready to go
And you look good, I thought you should know
You ain't like them other hoes

[Verse 1: Snootie Wild]
Come straight from the ghetto, ass all on the strip pole
Cashed out with a bankroll, now she focused on college
And I know that she polished, daddy used to swang yayo
Now he locked down on death row, independent, she's got it
And I know I'mma get her, and she know that I want her
Five star in my city, need that in my corner
Five packs for the fifty, posted up on the corner
Used to watching her daily, walks to school from my corner
Nigga driving her crazy, he just spurned on her
Real estate that pussy, let him know I'm the owner
Thoroughbred and I know soul, all about her gold robe
Dude must be loco, that's why I won't let go

[Hook: August Alsina]
She's a keeper, he don't know what to do
She's a keeper, I wanna be with, I wanna be with
She's a keeper, he don't know what to do with you
She's a keeper, he don't know what to do
Baby, you too bad and ya got all that ass
We both know that, I wanna be with
Cause she's a keeper babe, you the trillest for sure
Down to ride when I'm ready to go
And you look good, I thought you should know
You ain't like them other hoes

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
He don't know what to do with you
If he did, he wouldn't have put you through
All the things that he put you through
Now a street nigga won't fuck wit you
You allergic to these lame niggas
Might break ya out like allergies
I'll turn ya dream into your reality
Killin hoes, you a casualty
And you the one, I ain't gotta tell ya that though
Confidence high, yeah ya already know
I send a jet to your city just to bring ya to the show
Turn your house into a mall, turn your closet to a store
Know ya like that, not the gifts but the time
That I spend with ya, I'm tryna feel something real with ya
Hope this shit here never ever end with ya
I could be ya man and friend with ya

[Verse 3: Snootie Wild]
You my main chick, that shit mandatory
Ain't no other bitches in your category
Plus you a down bitch, that's another story
And you a real rider when it's necessary, so you a keeper

[Hook: August Alsina]
She's a keeper, he don't know what to do
She's a keeper, I wanna be with, I wanna be with
She's a keeper, he don't know what to do with you
She's a keeper, he don't know what to do
Baby, you too bad and ya got all that ass
We both know that, I wanna be with
Cause she's a keeper
She's a keeper
He don't know what to do
She's a keeper
I wanna be with (I wanna be with)
She's a keeper
He don't know what to do
She's a keeper
He don't know what to do
