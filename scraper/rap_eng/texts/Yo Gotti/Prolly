Okay, I never go nowhere without my heat, you prolly love that
I still go and get in the street, you prolly love that
With a couple bad bitches in the suite, you prolly love that
Wearin' nothin' but red bottoms on their feet, you prolly love that

Okay I'm fresh to death, I'm a fly guy killin' more shit than the drive by
Real shit, I'm laid back my brother Piff's a live wire
In the streets, flippin' pound, my set jumpin', I'm a high flier
I sold dope, my flow dope, I'm hot enough to start a wild fire
Another song in my archive. I'm about to blow like a bald tire
Ballin' out with my brother, then we get titty money and dog pile
30 30's and carbines I'm suited up like I'm on trial
I got a fully auto assault rifle that about the size of a small child
We can never be talked down, you go underground and we follow
We grind hard and we ball hard, other words, we don't call fouls
Got a bad bitch that's an immigrant. She try to act all innocent, But she turn into my little porn star behind closed doors, and window tint

Okay, I never go nowhere without my heat, you prolly love that
I still go and get in the street, you prolly love that
With a couple bad bitches in the suite, you prolly love that
Wearin' nothin' but red bottoms on their feet, you prolly love that
This is the life, lord
I got dirty money comin' out my pours
Fame, tour, I think one of these bitches could be yours

I'm 'bout about it like no limit, a cold heart with a hole in it
I'm seein' this zone like a strip club, got a bed room with a pole in it
More money, even more women I'm a trap nigga, I'm poor pimpin'
I didn't touch the water, just dove in it ain't no business like show business
Deep in it, let's go swimmin. Bitch undress let's go skinnin'
No name needed, no game needed, she throw that ass back and roll with it
She throw it at me, I go get it
I'm so hot you need stove mittens
I burn her up but I'm a cold nigga, let everyone in my force hit her
Sad is she prolly belong to you. I'm about to kill her pussy hope you only sue
When I'm finished with her, it's a funeral
I'm a pussy crook and I'm on the loose
If you lookin' for me, I'm on the roof
I'm sky high, all for the loot
My 9 ring, gotta listen close. If the money calls, I'm following through
NOTCH

Okay, I never go nowhere without my heat, you prolly love that
