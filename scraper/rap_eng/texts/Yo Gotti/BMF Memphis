[Hook]
I think I'm G-Train
Craig Petties
Ronnie Woods
Street legends
I do it for my city (2x)

[Verse 1]
I think I'm Yo Gotti
King of Memphis
I'm the youngest muthafucka who done ever did it
7 digits
I'm still strapped
Go against the king and get ya ass kidnapped
Lotta guns
I'm paranoid
I think I'm Tookie Williams
I think I'm Willie Loyd
North Memphis
I swear I'm king
But them young niggas around me like to gang bang
Red flag
Blue flag
White car
No flag
White House
No politician
All white affair
No Curtis Givens

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They think they Yo Gotti
Mini Me's
Tell me why so many niggas wanna mimic me
Go to war?
Are you retarded?!
Just for that, I'm bout to go and cop a white Ferrari
I stunt too hard
Ok, I'm sorry
You play too much
Nintendo Wii, Atari
My mind made
No local hoes
2010, I'm fucking global hoes
Hawaiian bitches, Korean hoes
Nigga I just bought a condo out in Tokyo
My money long
My team strong
My temper short
Your life gone

[Hook]
