[Bridge:]
It's been a long time comin'
A lot of dope runnin'
Hustlin' tryna dodge these cases
(This ya boy Yo Gotti!)
Niggas been tellin'
The streets been beggin'
So I had to go back to the basics (INE)

[Verse 1:]
This the intro to my life
The entry to my world
Ridgecrest apartments movin' that white girl
Posted up on the corner
Movin that marijuana
Glock 40 on my hip
Hollin' out you don't want it
My Glock stay cocked
Rocks in a match box
Hand gun wit no lock
Imma go getta
A nigga ran in yo spot
Confiscated yo block
And he didn't get shot
You'za hoe nigga
And I remember you, do you remember me?
Eighth grade leavin' school
Rockin' up a quarter key (dats wats up)
Ten tops on dat Z
I was passin ya
Fishscales swerving wit yo bitch on the passenger side
Shawty lets ride
Rims still spinnin' so shawty lets glide
She askin' me why, I don't get high
Cause bitch I make 50 off of 3.5 (n dats wats up)

[Chorus:]
You see me nigga, say whats up
Wanna be me nigga, that's whats up
Count ya dollar, pop ya collar then you holla that's whats up
See me shawty, say wats up
Wanna fuck me shawty?
That's whats up, that's whats up, that's whats up, tha that's whats up, that's whats up
