Say, I'm a rappin motherfucker, fuck that
I'm a trappin motherfucker, I make it happen, motherfucker
I went and got, put my niggas on
If you say you ain't eatin, to each it's own
I don't owe you shit, what you do for me?
You ain't sell that work, you ain't shoot for me
Heard niggas talkin down when I ain't around
But when I pull up it's the other way around
Real nigga this, real nigga that
Real niggas treat niggas with respect and you a pussy, nigga

So keep looking, nigga, keep your word to yourself before they have to book a nigga
Man I shook a nigga, took a nigga birds
'Cause I take offense to nigga's words
Watch your mouth, homie
One nigga hating on my grind
I'm from the city but they don't want me to shine
I don't get it, niggas trying to hold me down
Like they don't want me to climb, to the top
But they're plan declined

I'm in war with my enemies, watching niggas who close to me
My young niggas ride or die and this how it's 'pose to be
The hate at a all-time high, I'm keeping that toast with me
It's shoot first ask question later, 'cause that's how it 'pose to be

And every day I wake up, I'm face the haters
Knowing it don't 'pose to be this way
Even my own home boys, they're playing games, lord
And this strap gone put 'em in they place
If I kill a nigga will they repent my sins?
Hustling day and night, I try to get a new benz
Is you an enemy or friend?

What I'm supposed to do, back against the wall
Strap on my dog, real me, blind if I don't fall
They say when the smoke clear, a lot of niggas they ain gon be around
But my young niggas, they'll hold me down
Thug life, outlaw, feeling like I'm pac
Put that strap on his ass, have 'em in a state of shock
Ambulance came, now they takin his ass to the doc
And when the white boys come, nigga, I ain't trying to talk
It's CMG for life, exercise your muscle, you gotta tighten your hustle
Get your money, my nigga, don't get caught in the shuffle
I play the cards I was dealt, I bet it all and double
And I never lost money to suckers, how real is dat

Every day I wake up, I'm faced the haters
Knowing it don't 'posed to be this way
Even my own home boys, they playing games, lord
And this strap, gone put 'em in they place
If I kill a nigga will they repent my sins?
Hustling day and night, I'm tryna get a new benz
Is you an enemy or friend?

I'm in war with my enemies, watching niggas that's close to me
My young niggas ride or die and that's how it's 'posed to be
The hate at a all time high, I'm keeping that toast with me
It's shoot first, ask question later
'cause that's how its 'posed to be
