[Hook: Kodak Black]
So much cheese no not government
We just hit a lick for 10 bands
But now I need 100 grand
Got cookies like the gingerbread man
All these 100’s pop my rubberband
Shut up, your irrelevant ass
Make it rain call me thunderman
Dammit where the weatherman at?

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Trap money, Neiman Marcus
250 in my pocket, I can buy a 'rari
I'm young, black and rich, I know I'm a target
If I put my hands up, they gon' shoot regardless
I just bought my sister that new Benz
This money turn your enemies to friends
Lil bitch tryna chop me for the pussy
So I would never fuck that hoe again
Audemaur, nig,  been a star, just bought another car
I been sellin' bricks, so white sour diesel out the jar
Cocaine had a nigga far, all my dogs know who they are
All my plugs gon' bring they pack, all my hoes gon' play they part
I'm the weather man, whatever man
Make it rain, make it snow, tell a hoe
I'ma change her
Like fuck her then tell her she gotta go
They like "Gotti, where the forecast at?"
I predict a lot of snow coming in, with a little Kodak

[Hook: Kodak Black]
So much cheese no not government
We just hit a lick for 10 bands
But now I need 100 grand
Got cookies like the gingerbread man
All these 100’s pop my rubberband
Shut up, your irrelevant ass
Make it rain call me thunderman
Dammit where the weatherman at?

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
You run up, I'm gon' bust your damn ass
That Kodak, he got so much damn swag
You always outchea lettin' your pants sag
Lil boy, you need to go to damn class
I just bought my mom a Louis handbag
I just run a target for 10 bands
Lil niggas gettin' all the damn cash
So that why all you niggas gettin' mad
Not government, a nigga gettin' cheese
I was in the trap since elementary
20 pack, can call me Ed Reed
Might take another trip to Larry
Filthy bitch, look at your damn feet
He come behind me on the banshee
Did I tell you what I hit for 10 G?
Me and Jackboy like Ed and Eddy

[Hook: Kodak Black]
So much cheese no not government
We just hit a lick for 10 bands
But now I need 100 grand
Got cookies like the gingerbread man
All these 100’s pop my rubberband
Shut up, your irrelevant ass
Make it rain call me thunderman
Dammit where the weatherman at?
