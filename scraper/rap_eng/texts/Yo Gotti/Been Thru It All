[Intro: Yo Gotti]
Yeah...
Somebody pray for me
I done been through it all
Somebody pray for me
Hey I'm speaking pain homie
I done been through it all

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Robbed niggas, got robbed
Shot at, shot back
Couple niggas got wet
I done been through it all

Flat broke, down bad on my luck
In the trap
Hustling backwards like I'm stuck
I done been through it all

Caught a case, got a bond
Couldn’t make it
Sick and tired of going to jail
But can’t shake it
I done been through it all
I done been through it all
I done been through it all

[Verse I: Yo Gotti]
Lost my dog and my freedom this year
Stretched out
I can’t even think clear
I done been through it all

Bills coming, money funny, I’m a youngin'
Have you ever seen your momma shed a tear?
I done been through it all

Fuck the time, I can do it
It don't phase me
But my partner turnin' straight
Drive me crazy
Damn, I been through it all

Baby momma broke bad, came back, broke bad
I'm like man, this ho crazy
I done been through it all

Went to school, shoes dirty
Got a job, tried working
Man shit ain't been perfect
Been through it all

Loaf of bread
Kool-aid refrigerated
And a cabinet full of noodles
So I ate it
I done been through it all

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Robbed niggas, got robbed
Shot at, shot back
Couple niggas got wet
I done been through it all

Flat broke, down bad on my luck
In the trap
Hustling backwards like I'm stuck
I done been through it all

Caught a case, got a bond
Couldn’t make it
Sick and tired of going to jail
But can’t shake it
I done been through it all
I done been through it all
I done been through it all

[Verse II: Yo Gotti]
Guns blazing at the club, bow-bow
Seen blood, so I fled from the scene
I done been through it all

Detectives calling, asking questions
Wanna talk, I don’t know nothing
I’mma stand up for the team
I done been through it all

I’m the man, twenty bands
Went and bought my first block
And that shit was sheetrock
Hey I done been through it all

Sleep light, let off shots at the cops
Cause they kicked in the door and didn't knock
I done been through it all

Gun fights, fist fights, club nights
Soon as I see the other side it's on sight
I done been through it all

First shooting, earned stripes
Damn near got life
But I thought it was exciting
I done been through it all

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Robbed niggas, got robbed
Shot at, shot back
Couple niggas got wet
I done been through it all

Flat broke, down bad on my luck
In the trap
Hustling backwards like I'm stuck
I done been through it all

Caught a case, got a bond
Couldn’t make it
Sick and tired of going to jail
But can’t shake it
I done been through it all
I done been through it all
I done been through it all

[Verse III: Yo Gotti]
Down on my knees, I'm just praying
Going back and forth with God
I’m just saying
I done been through it all

Rap cool, fuck school
Kids wearing uniform
Man I hit that bitch in troops
I been through it all

Grandma died, momma cryin'
Had to hold my hurt inside
Ma I had to be there for you
Hey, I been through it all

Got signed, unsigned, got signed
Waste of time
What a fuck they gonna do?
I done been through it all

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Robbed niggas, got robbed
Shot at, shot back
Couple niggas got wet
I done been through it all

Flat broke, down bad on my luck
In the trap
Hustling backwards like I'm stuck
I done been through it all

Caught a case, got a bond
Couldn’t make it
Sick and tired of going to jail
But can’t shake it
I done been through it all
I done been through it all
I done been through it all
