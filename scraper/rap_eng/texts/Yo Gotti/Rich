[Verse 1: K. Michelle]
Woke up, oh yeah!
Getting money, oh yeah!
So what, why you care?
Thats life, and life isn't fair
Why the government wanna try me?
Already know they don't like me
Go back in, I need the whole feet
I dont care if you dont like me

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause Im Rich
Dont care if you dont like me
Cause Im Rich
Dont care if you dont like me

[Chorus]
I got rich people problems
Only way to solve 'em
Keep on gettin' rich
Richer and Richer
I need every single dollar
I got rich people problems
Only way to solve 'em
Keep on gettin' rich
Richer and Richer
I need every single dollar

[Verse 2: K. Michelle]
Tough cookie, oh yeah!
Good nookie, oh yeah!
On my first date, take me straight to the bank
Why yo baby momma wanna fight me?
Already know she dont like me
Say Im getting money, yeah I might be
I dont care if you dont like me, Cause I'm...

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause Im Rich
Dont care if you dont like me
Cause Im Rich
Dont care if you dont like me

[Chorus]
I got rich people problems
Only way to solve 'em
Keep on gettin' rich
Richer and Richer
I need every single dollar
I got rich people problems
Only way to solve 'em
Keep on gettin' rich
Richer and Richer
I need every single dollar

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Im running, Im running up like the bank teller
Dont speak 'bout no numbers I let the bank tell 'em
Alexander McQueen, a pair of Magalis (Saucey)
An Aventador in white, Look like a marshmellow (Saucey)
Drive way stupid, look like a car dealer
High school, six figures, got 'em sick hospital
Broke niggas always calling hoes gold diggers
She hold money and you dont, dont blame the hoe nigga
We be rocking rollies we just got to show niggas
Why you out here stuntin' and you still owe niggas?
And K. Michelle thats my dog from the city
But on the low, Im still tryna hit it, Ayune!

[Verse 4: Trina]
I keep a couple racks tucked off in the bag
Label me a villian when it comes to the swag
Louie v luggage, got the towels and rags
And my garage like a zoo, Im taming horses and jags
Uh! Now wipe me off, Now wipe down
Cause I know you hatin bitches dont like me
Im the one all the gossip stay talking bout
Baddest Bitch, biggest whip in the parking lot
And I ain't never going broke
Cause imma chase that money
You might see me in the hood for the corprate honey
Counting coperate money
Dinner gowns and tuxedos
Eating sheppard bed meals, cashing big burritos
Big dinero, rich money dont sleep
I got to have it every day of the week
Rich Bitch Problems, I dont wanna solve 'em
Ten yachts by each other, Yeah Bitch I own all of 'em
Cause Im rich

[Pre-Chorus]
Dont care if you dont like me
Cause Im Rich
Dont care if you dont like me

[Chorus]
I got rich people problems
Only way to solve 'em
Keep on gettin' rich
Richer and Richer
I need every single dollar
I got rich people problems
Only way to solve 'em
Keep on gettin' rich
Richer and Richer
I need every single dollar
Cause Im Rich
