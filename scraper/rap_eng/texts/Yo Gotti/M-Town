[Intro: Yo Gotti]
Ay Nigga..
When You Talkin' Memphis You Talkin' Me..
Nigga I Am Memphis
Who The Only Motherfucker With A Half A Million Dollars Worth Of Cars & Everything White Biotch ?
I'm Cocaine Crazy!

[Verse: Yo Gotti]
To My City North Memphis Where They Get Get It Gutta
& I Learned How To Sell Cocaine From My Big Brother
While Tryna Tell My Sister To Carry Her Ass To School
Gotta Do The Right Thing Cuz Your Brother Breakin The Rules
What An Inspiration
What A Role Model
Man I'm Tryna Follow Footsteps Of My Father
& He A OG Nigga Straight Outta Hyde Park
It Took Me So Many Years To Get Along With Hyde Park
I Left That V Shit Alone & Took Upon A Job
I Put The North On The Map
Each & Every Part
Each & Every Hood
Every Single Gangsta
All The Dope Boys
& Every Gang Banger
Would You Believe Me If I Told You I Was A Millionaire?
My Lamborghini Paid For
& The Truth Is I Don't Fuckin' Care
I Don't Respect Money
Respect Real Niggas
Want For Money Only Get You Killed Nigga
Can't Buy Love
Can't Hide Hate
100% Percent Fact
Most Niggas Fake
Most Bitches Lie
But Some Bitches Don't
Most Niggas Change
But My Niggas Won't
Nigga Welcome To Memphis
I'm In The Kitchen
Sunday Night It's Goin Down
Fall in at Visions
Pop Me Some Bottles
Find Me Some Bitches
Just Gimme A Room
Handle My Business
Goin To River (River)
Look At The Bridge (Bridge)
Blunt To The Head
Think Bout The Shit That I Did
Walk In The Bank
Everyone Helps
Walkin' Outta The Bank
& I'm Feelin' Myself
Cut On The TV
& I'm Seein' Myself
Real Talk Dawg I Really Like Bein Myself
BET , MTV I'm Seein' Myself
Real Talk Dawg I Really Like Bein Myself (Gotti!)
Really Like Bein Myself (Gotti!)
(Outro)
If I Was You I Would Wanna Be Me Too
