[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
My lil niggas, them always on go, they never on pause
I know some niggas committed some murders, ain't none of them solved
Niggas be talking, be acting like bitches, I call 'em RuPaul
I got some bitches I fuck time to time, don't love em at all
Having my feelings involved, that's something I can't do
Get the pussy no cap, that's something I can't do
Leave the house without the strap, that's something I can't do
Nah, I just can't do it

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
I just can't be broke
You gotta have type of hustle 'bout yourself, fuck my P.O
I'm sippin' plenty lean and smokin' propane, that's that good smoke
(That's that good gas, nigga, what you is?)
Just a hood nigga with money
I'm in a foreign whip riding dirty, it got bogus tags on it
College bitch with me can't suck dick, really all she do is gag on it
Fucked around and got a ratchet bitch pregnant, I hit her raw man
Fresh out the bando, eighty thou, it can't fit in these Balmains
(Can't fit in my jeans)
C-Bo told me stack it up and go hard on these niggas and hating hoes
When you in the streets you can't leave that strap, that's a part of your wardrobe
And I rock expensive attire
After she fuck she fired
These hoes be slicker than niggas
Can't love 'em, these bitches be liars
I be around murderers (What they do?)
They shooting like Manu (Ginobli)
Just keep your mouth close homie, snitching?
That's something you can't do (don't break the code)

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
My lil niggas, them always on go, they never on pause
I know some niggas committed some murders, ain't none of them solved
Niggas be talking, be acting like bitches, I call 'em RuPaul
I got some bitches I fuck time to time, don't love em at all
Having my feelings involved, that's something I can't do
Get the pussy no cap, that's something I can't do
Leave the house without the strap, that's something I can't do
Nah, I just can't do it

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
MoneyBagg, MoneyBagg
Hold up, let me set the record straight
I am the king, ain't got to hate
Every nigga 'round me done ate
[?] killin' niggas, yellow tape
That other nigga is just a mini-me
I watched his interviews, don't like his energy
Only D'usse, not the Hennessy
Ooh, pulled up in a half a million dollar car like fuck these niggas
When you twenty million dollars up, you don't be studying niggas
I'm the plug, recruiter
A city of shooters
RIP to Young Trulla (J-Money)
Every mob in my city mobbin'
Every nigga in my city robbin'
I make fast cash from glad bags
In the kitchen duffle bag, gang gang
Young nigga from the city, got heart, Draco bangin'
Them my lil niggas and them
And they'll go hittin' them, hittin' them
Them the three letters (CMG)
CMG, they under my leadership
And this shit 2 Federal, for real

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
My lil niggas, them always on go, they never on pause
I know some niggas committed some murders, ain't none of them solved
Niggas be talking, be acting like bitches, I call 'em RuPaul
I got some bitches I fuck time to time, don't love em at all
Having my feelings involved, that's something I can't do
Get the pussy no cap, that's something I can't do
Leave the house without the strap, that's something I can't do
Nah, I just can't do it
