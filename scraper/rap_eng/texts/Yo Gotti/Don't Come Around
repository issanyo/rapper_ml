[Chorus: Kendall Morgan]
Don’t come around again
I believe it, I believe it
Don’t come around again
I believe it, I believe it

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
When a nigga talk dope, they don't never speak about the truth
They don't never speak about you
When a nigga talk real, you don't even know how it feel
How you gon' tell me what it is
When a nigga say Gotti, all they know is Leer and Maserati
All they know is turnin' up the party
All they know is young nigga with a whole bunch of rollies
All they know is young nigga gon' catch a body
When a nigga say north, nigga talkin' bout jumpin off the porch
With a bag full of 50 St. Croix
Nigga talkin' bout trying to fight a gun charge
Trying to fight a brick charge, lawyer ain't show up in court
When a nigga say trial, nigga talkin' bout gambling with his life
That’s how a nigga really earn his stripes
When them niggas say he don't fuck with me like I fuck with him
He ain’t finna do something right
That nigga finna snitch, man I knew that nigga was a bitch
Man I knew that nigga wasn't shit
He ain’t got no heart, man I knew that nigga was risk
Should've killed him when he we went on that lick
When them niggas say bang, nigga they be talking bout my squad
Nigga they be talkin bout my cars
When they say white, nigga they be talkin bout bricks
I'll buy that shit off of black card, talk to em

[Chorus: Kendall Morgan]
Don’t come around again
I believe it, I believe it
Don’t come around again
I believe it, I believe it

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
When them niggas say bitch, we don’t really mean no harm
She ain’t gotta be so offensed
When a nigga say ho, ain’t say you know what you is
Shawty you ain’t got to be so defensive
Niggas say you bad, that’s a compliment, not literally
Half naked pictures, but you lookin' for a gentleman
Instagram your whole life after the pull of trying to get your followers up
Sold your soul to the internet
Damn, damn right it's a cold world
Losing sleep by my little girl
Damn Mariah hope you don't be like Maliah
Damn sure hope you don't be like oh girl
True when a nigga say he like you
Niggas sayin' what he gon' do?
Tell a nigga he a lie
Tell him that a real bad bitch get his own so that money can’t buy
When a nigga say he ballin, ask him where his title and his deeds at
Not where his clothes and his keys at
Ask him is he renting, tell him that your daddy was a real baller
He was blowin' money by the seasons
Let him know you good, left a couple mil in the will for you
Big burner rays right that’ll kill for you
Mama broke bad, left a nigga down bad
I ain’t trippin, don’t show I’m still here for you

[Chorus: Kendall Morgan]
Don’t come around again
I believe it, I believe it
Don’t come around again
I believe it, I believe it
