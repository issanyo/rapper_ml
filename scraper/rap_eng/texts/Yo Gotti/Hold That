[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
What's up with her?
She know she ain't right
Jeans don't fit her
She got that kind of body that I like
Somebody's with her
But I don't see no man in sight
I'm tryin' to get her
And I only need her for one night

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
So can I borrow that?
Ay girl can I borrow that? (Oh-ooh-whoa)
Can I borrow that?
Won't you let a nigga hold that?
Can I hold that? Can I hold that?
Ay girl can I hold that? (Oh-ooh-whoa)
Won't you let a nigga hold that?

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
Let's go missin'
I'm gon' need you by my side
I love the way you twerk it
I can see you on my pole tonight
No one around us
So ain't nobody gonna be listenin'
No sleep 'til morning
I have you in a cab by 9AM

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
So can I borrow that?
Ay girl can I borrow that? (Oh-ooh-whoa)
Can I borrow that?
Won't you let a nigga hold that?
Can I hold that? Can I hold that?
Ay girl can I hold that? (Oh-ooh-whoa)
Won't you let a nigga hold that?

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Exercise, put yo hand where yo toes at (get low)
Hit it in the kitchen where the stove at (by the oven)
Here's a hundred grand, shawty you can hold that
Ass phat, face aight you think you all that (Oh)
See a bag got C's on it (Chanel)
Set a trap for a rat put cheese on it (what that have?)
White crib, white house, couple keys on it (work)
Shawty so thick, look [not need dun it?] (Gotti!)
I-I'm a real street nigga (I am)
Say Sean, she a real meat eater
I had her and her friend in a two-seater ("skurt")
Lynch mob, no body, she a head keeper (work)

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
So can I borrow that?
Ay girl can I borrow that? (Oh-ooh-whoa)
Can I borrow that?
Won't you let a nigga hold that?
Can I hold that? Can I hold that?
Ay girl can I hold that? (Oh-ooh-whoa)
Won't you let a nigga hold that?

[Outro: Sean Kingston]
Baby girl can I hold that
Girl, can I hold, Can I
Baby girl can I hold that
Girl, can I hold, Can I
Baby girl can I hold that
Girl, can I hold, Can I
Baby girl can I hold that
Girl, can I hold, Can I
