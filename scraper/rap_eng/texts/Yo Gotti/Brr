[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
You wanna visit Gucci world, girl, here's a brochure
What a  cold watch, make your wife say burrr
Golf balls in my ear like burrr burrr burrr
Got a 'rari with an engine in the rear, look and hear
Shining harder than your partner red amulets, match the carpets
You my son, I'm your father, this here trust all on the author
So what's popping? Orville Redenbacher. I'm so OJ, ok
I'm so Waka Flocka, fuck it, I might smoke in front the DA
I'm so Gotti, I might buck it, two tear drops so I feel like fuckin'
You a crystal in a bucket, got a 6K show in Kentucky
Run up on a kid and he won't be lucky, might be alright and he'll be unlucky
.38 revolver in the club, try Brick Squad and this shit get ugly
[gucci!]

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Soulja Boy off in this ho, I'm gon' roll up all this dro
Gucci on the passenger, the Ferrari's painted, whoa
Boy you already know the yellow diamond Breitling boy
Fifty stacks plus hundred stacks, a hundred wrecks I hit destroy
I aim for the fucking pain, bitch you know my name
Swang swang in that Gucci Mane, man you know I let my chain
Hang, don't go do my thang, Soulja Boy gon' blang
Blang blang blang, and I let it burrr all off of your e'rrr
Dissap'rrr, bitch you hate on me, man you fake on me
And it's like a masterpiece the way my artists tat on me
Tatted on my chest, tatted on my neck man you know it's like
I think I'm DJ Khaled, cause we the fucking best!

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
White bracelet so ignorant the yellow one the matching kit
Cold hearted nigga and I run around with lunatics
They be on some shootin' shit. I be on some neutral shit
Since I got some soldiers I'm on some might as well use 'em shit
(Burrr) Left his body cold, you know how the story goes
Nigga disrespect the king, left him full of bullet holes
(Burrr) Shorty cold with it, work the pole with it
Magic City money, touch her toes with it
(Burrr) Rubber bands now
(Burrr) Money floatin' up
(Burrr) Money floatin' down
(Burrr) Bitches baggin' up
(Burrr) Half a million ones
(Ones) That's a lotta paper
(Burrr) Couple hundred guns
(Guns) Ready for the haters
