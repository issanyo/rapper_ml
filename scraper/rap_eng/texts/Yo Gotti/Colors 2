[Intro: Yo Gotti]
World black and white and I'm color blind!
All I see is green, and them dollar
Signs

Black on black hoodie with the black mask
White on white whips and the rims match
World black and white and I'm colorblind!
All I see is green, and them dollar signs

Tried to wire a nigga up? Dumbass
I switch 150 channels like Comcast
Whole world black and white: television

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

World black and white, and I'm color blind
All I see is green and them dollar signs

I'm Yo Gotti

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Black on black hoodie with the black mask
White on white whips and them rims match
World black and white and I'm color blind
All I see is green, and them dollar signs
Black on black hoodie with the black mask
White on white whips and them rims match
World black and white and I'm color blind
All I see is green, and them dollar signs

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Try to wire a nigga up, dumbass
I switched 150 channels, like Comcast
Whole world black and white, television
Pink Panther-ass niggas, I can tell they snitchin
No cartoons, I was selling tweedy birds
Niggas ain't from the streets, he got alotta nerve
I just pulled up on my buddy, he had a plant of purple
Smokin Whoopi Goldberg, we call it the color purple
In a CL 600, all white
Talkin Bob Barker bricks, cause the price is right
Mister Dale Earnhardt move the work fast
Whole buncha white squares in em black bags
I just wanna see some green and some rubberbands
Into makin money flyin, watchin strippers dance
Shawty said she light skin, and I should call her red
Told her it's a black and white world and I just want some head

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Black on black hoodie with the black mask
White on white whips and them rims match
World black and white and I'm color blind
All I see is green, and them dollar signs
Black on black hoodie with the black mask
White on white whips and them rims match
World black and white and I'm color blind
All I see is green, and them dollar signs

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci Mane, call me Stevie Wonder
I don't see these haters, I just see the numbers
I just see the money, I just see the commas
Drop the top on my vette, I just see the summa
Bunch old jacked white guys in my pocket, racks
I stash the re up then fuck up the profit
I might cash out, I might spazz out
You throwin rocks, but you livin in a glass house
Put my Gucci shades on, I got night vision
Shiftin gears in my rarri like it's ??
And everyday I'm on go, you on straight pause
I don't see you niggas, it's like I'm Ray Charles
Yeah I'm color blind, I like yellow bones
I like my coke white, I like my kush strong
So nigga tune in, my life a mob movie
Say it's a cold drought, then nigga call gucci!

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Black on black hoodie with the black mask

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
All I see is dead people
Soo woop, all I see is red people
Red dots, chop chop, I see dead people
Shoot him through his snap back, make his head see through
Body count, body count
Add anotha nigga to my body count
AR15 hold alotta rounds
Sniper kit, so that bitch don't make nada sound
FN-57 with them blue tips
20 shot clip, that should move shit
White car, that's my cool whip
Still movin 8 balls, without a pool stick
Santana bitch, I don't see no colors
But I see you hatin ass mafuckas
I got some lil niggas that'll do ya dirty
Free of charge too, they just wanna put some work in
