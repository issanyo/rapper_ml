[Verse: Yo Gotti & Cardi B]
I say I just wanna get money bitch
Oh yeah, we better get it tonight
You say too smart need to stay home
Brr, ya
Ya I'm home and I'm poppin' pussy

[Verse: Cardi B]
Say where I'm at, K.O.D
Where I'm at? I'm at LIV
What I'm doin'? poppin' pussy
Out the grave, who I'm with
What you mean? I'm where all the cash at
All this shmoney made a bitch have a flashback

I ride that dick like a Porsche
Gucci Bag, Prada Shorts
And I play with his balls, I should try out for sports
I thought you was the wife, guess y'all got a divorce
(?) All that cashing, why y'all hating, guess that feels less resort

I can't stand when a nigga say they knew me, that's a knew me now
Still a Ramen Noodles Type of bitch, but I'm boujee now
Hair wrapped, duvy style
Back it up, Juvenile
Drop it low, doo doo brown
I'm in his mouth, root canal
Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-OFF!


[Verse: Yo Gotti]
She only VIP 'cause she fuck the promoter (got damn)
Niggas sippin' Ace Of Spade-like it's soda (got damn)
