[Hook]
I know a lot, but there's some things I dont know
Don't know no bitch that I can't hit, don't know no chick that say no
Don't know no chips that I can't get, don't know no whip I can't own
Shit, I know a lot, but there's some things I dont know
Don't know no ugly bitches
Don't know no broke niggas
Don't know no snitch niggas
Don't know no bitch niggas
There's some things I don't know

[Verse One: Kevin Gates]
Don't know nobody leaning harder, Phantom bought while out in Florida
Condo out in Georgia, my little daughter died in this water
Don't know nobody who ain't retarded
Know there's a name, don't know what to call it
Activist flowing like a faucet, 40's my precaution
Don't know who can't afford to take a trip when they get bored
Keep they chick in Michael Kors, wake up in designer stores
Infinity trucks be pulling up, Louis luggage on the floor
Ain't being searched by TSA, private jets we finna board

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Yo Gotti]
Don't know no car that I ain't got
Don't know no crib I can't buy
Killing case
Don't know no war I won't fight
Don't know no work I won't sell
I know niggas facing L's but my niggas won't tell
Don't know no bitch that I can't fuck
Don't know no ho I did save
I ain't never been no trick [but that's how I was raised?]
I know broke niggas and they hate all the time
I like ratchet bitches but that bitch gotta be fine

REST COMING SOON!

[Verse Three: K Camp]
I don't like no bitch niggas
I can't stand no hoes, nigga
I know a lot but it's some things I don't know
Don't know no chick I can't bust for my whole team she gon' go
Don't know no snakes, can't fuck with them
I keep my grass oh so low
Shit, I know a lot but it's some things I don't know
Don't know no broke niggas
Don't know no snitch niggas
But I know your bitch nigga
I'm just tryna get rich nigga
And that's all that I know
