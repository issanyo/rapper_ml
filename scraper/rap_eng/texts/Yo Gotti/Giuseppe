You couldn't walk in my Giuseppe shoes
Walk in my Giuseppe shoes
Bitch you couldn't walk in my Giuseppe shoes
Walk in my Giuseppe shoes
I'm wearin' designer clothes
Takin' designer drugs
Hoes show me love
When I'm inside the club, okay

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
KTZ jogging suit
Man that boy cockin' loot
I paid for the pussy man
But it ain't somethin' that I often do, yeah
Treat her like a prostitute
Purse with the matchin' boots
I hit her in the driveway
Like it's a mansion in the fuckin' coupe, yeah
All we do is go get it
I'm allergic to broke niggas (achoo, achoo)
And even if I'm playin' ball
The cheapest thing I got on 450
Rappers try to befriend a nigga
On skinny ass ties, wearin' skinny ass tie
My outfit from the Grammys might kill you nigga
Chef cook crab legs with the Dom PÃ©rignon nigga
I'm a fuckin' don nigga, put a fuckin' target on him
Giuseppes Zanottis on your motherfuckin' lawn nigga
Steppin' on your sofa, roll it on my arm homie
Ass so big, she need a fuckin' alarm on it

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
You couldn't walk in my Giuseppe shoes
Walk in my Giuseppe shoes
Bitch you couldn't walk in my Giuseppe shoes
Walk in my Giuseppe shoes
I'm wearin' designer clothes
Takin' designer drugs
Hoes show me love
When I'm inside the club, okay

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Club toxic with the zero print
Gold on the tip, pay your fuckin' rent
She only rock heels, she a bad bitch
30 bands in the shoebox from the last brick
Money don't talk, it just look good
Put me in a suit and tie, still I look hood
Designer hoes, Atlanta hoes
Couple bougie bitches from the west coast
In my white on white Giuseppes
Nigga I'm fresh to death, can't help it
Memphis my hood, I reppin'
Love ratchet bitches, I love it, can't help it
Black and yellow Lambo, Oreo space coupe
Jump out with them 'seppes on lookin' like space boots
Cartier Rollie watch, nigga lookin' antique
Just counted out another million, that's a cool week

You couldn't walk in my Giuseppe shoes
Walk in my Giuseppe shoes
Bitch you couldn't walk in my Giuseppe shoes

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
I see that grill on the two door lookin' barracuda
You know that barrel on the Desert Eagle lookin' like a tuba
Five or six Rollies, flexin' like I'm Lex Luger
Chop the rocks with the razor and my hand Freddie Kruger
I'm a fool with the hanger but my fork game viscous
Lil man bitch, keep the extras, Merry Christmas
I'm a Balenciaga wearin', Clive Christian ass nigga
You keep my name in your mouth, always bitchin' ass nigga
Swear the roof on the motherfucker looking like astrology
Is that a half a million dollar car? Shit it gotta be
These niggas is your enemies, that's just my philosophy
And all these swagger jackin' niggas owe you an apology
Icy white, two bricks on my feet nigga
Avion be on makin' money while I sleep nigga
Cop the mid, cop the low, just to style on 'em
My Air Forces, nigga, you couldn't walk a mile in 'em

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
