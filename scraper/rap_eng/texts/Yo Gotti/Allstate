Man I'm tired of all these fake ass niggas
Riding 'round talking all this shit ass niggas
All up in the grass, old snake ass niggas
Keep something to say, old hating ass niggas
We be getting money and they hate that nigga
Beefing?  Better have Allstate my nigga
They be chasing pussy while we caked up nigga
Mad at the world cuz they ain't us nigga

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Real niggas straight up pay the price for it
Fuck niggas they would trade your life for it
Cool with the Bloods and I'm cool with these Crips
And these Gs and I'm fucking with these Vice Lords
If you a real nigga holla: I KNOW
If you a fuck nigga, I don't think so
Youngins in the hood got them Draco
I be with the paper bitch I'm Kinkos
Real nigga that life goes be a real nigga like me
Bitch this is how I'm living this shit ain't for TV
Pop a Xan then pop another Perc
Bitch wanna be saved go to church
Nigga wanna get paid get some work
Nigga wanna snatch a chain get murked
Old project nigga boy I been grimy
I don't fuck with these niggas cuz they some timey

Man I'm tired of all these fake ass niggas
Riding 'round talking all this shit ass niggas
All up in the grass, old snake ass niggas
Keep something to say, old hating ass niggas
We be getting money and they hate that nigga
Beefing?  Better have Allstate my nigga
They be chasing pussy while we caked up nigga
Mad at the world cuz they ain't us nigga

You a real nigga on the Internet
Real street niggas we ain't into that
Real street niggas we ain't looking back
Take a nigga's bitch like give me that
You be on your cycle you a bitch ass nigga
Frontin for these hoes you a trick ass nigga
Heard they took your chain you a lick ass nigga
Playing both sides you a switch ass nigga
You ain't taking care your kids, but taking care of these hoes
Where your OGs?  Where your morals and your codes?

And how the fuck you living with yourself nigga
Got to thank the man that I'am, blessed nigga And everyday I wake up brush my teeth and grab my scrap to start my day man I think about my problems
And every time I go and meet the plug and get the sack and give him his money i think about robbing

Niggas taking selfies with another nigga baby momma fucking on another nigga (Dang) we be riding around with the gutta nigga
Pretty Boys Do't Wanna See Them Ugly Niggas
Label say am anti-social (why) cause i don't really fuck with the social (network)
Cause i don't have time for the emojis
Cause bitch am in the hood with the yola

Man I'm tired of all these fake ass niggas
Riding 'round talking all this shit ass niggas
All up in the grass, old snake ass niggas Keep something to say, old hating ass niggas
We be getting money and they hate that nigga

They be chasing pussy while we caked up nigga
Mad at the world cuz they ain't us nigga
