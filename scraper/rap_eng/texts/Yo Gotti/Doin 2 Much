[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
I got a thang for bitches
I don't really hang with bitches
But if you see me with 'em
Nine times out of ten I'm banging them bitches
All we do is fuck, but she say we don't do it enough
Calling my phone, going ham
Damn Pam, you be doin' too much
All on my Instagram tryna spazz out, you be doin' too much
Wanna screenshot while we FaceTime, you be doin' too much
Got me on speakerphone 'round your friends
Ho you really doin' too much
All at my shows, pulling on my clothes
Ho you really doin' too much

[Verse 1: MoneyBagg Yo]
Bitch thought she had a blessing
Ho lied like she pregnant
To tell the truth she was messy
Screenshotting our messages
I ain't gon' lie, I hit her a couple times
I really was thirsty though
She was just one of them bitches you hit four in the morning
Like come to the door
Crust in her eyes while she drive, she coming straight to me
She put that rachet pussy head on a nigga
I'm going straight to sleep
I tried to tell her fold it, she unfolded
I can't have fucking with you on my name
We started off cool and then the shit changed
I guess the good dick done fucked up her brain
Hold up, hold up, lil bitch you tripping out
Got a bitch at the house, you not my spouse
Without a doubt, I stopped fucking with you
Had to cut you off, like scissors will do
Ain't gon' lie, your lil action was clutch
But you just was doin' too much
Puttin' your friends on what we got going on
Bitch keep that on the hush

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo & Yo Gotti]
I got a thang for bitches
I don't really hang with bitches
But if you see me with 'em
Nine times out of ten I'm banging them bitches
All we do is fuck, but she say we don't do it enough
Calling my phone, going ham
Damn Pam, you be doin' too much
All on my Instagram tryna spazz out, you be doin' too much
(Ho you be doin' too much)
Wanna screenshot while we FaceTime, you be doin' too much
(Ho you be doin' too much)
Got me on speakerphone 'round your friends
Ho you really doin' too much
(Ho you be doin' too much)
All at my shows, pulling on my clothes
Ho you really doin' too much

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I fell in love with Keyshia (what else?)
I had a thang for Tamika (my lil buddy)
That ho was asking too much (too much)
She made it hard to keep her (she made it hard)
I had a menage for cheaper (two girls)
Had a garage of reefer (a lab)
When you get money and everybody begging
That shit have you dodging people (dodge)
I use to be robbing people (robbin')
These bitches be charging people (what?)
I had a lil bitch at the mall, so bad
I went to her job to meet her (Foot Locker)
I still be lying to bitches (lyin')
These niggas be crying to bitches (niggas be cryin' to bitches)
These niggas be doin' too much (doin' too much)
These bitches be trying these niggas (where do you find these niggas?)
These niggas be stressing, these hoes be messy
But I don't be giving a fuck (I don't be givin' a fuck)
I don;t wanna talk to you, don't wanna kick it
Just give a you band to fuck
She caught me slipping, she took a picture of me (damn)
Then sent that shit to her friends (group text)
He fell asleep in that pussy again
He fell asleep in that pussy again

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo & Yo Gotti]
I got a thang for bitches (a thang)
I don't really hang with bitches (don't really hang)
But if you see me with 'em
Nine times out of ten I'm banging them bitches
(I bang them bitches)
All we do is fuck (fuck), but she say we don't do it enough
Calling my phone, going ham
Damn Pam, you be doin' too much
(Ho you be doin' too much)
All on my Instagram tryna spazz out, you be doin' too much
(Ho you be doin' too much)
Wanna screenshot while we FaceTime, you be doin' too much
(Ho you be doin' too much)
Got me on speakerphone 'round your friends
Ho you really doin' too much
(Ho you be doin' too much)
All at my shows, pulling on my clothes
Ho you really doin' too much

[Outro: Yo Gotti]
Ho you be doin' too much
Be doin' too much
Ho you be doin' too much
