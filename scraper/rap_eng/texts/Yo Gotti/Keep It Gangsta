[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I'm a gangsta nigga, I got a gansta grill
A nigga signed with stunna got like a half of mill
Alot hating they don't wanna see a gangsta chill
But fuck it I'm a tell em how a gangsta feel
I see the industry fake, cause ain't no gangstas in it
But every motherfucker wanna play that gangsta image
Niggas rap about bricks then they get all excited
I rap bout dope cause I sold & pray I don't get indicted
And I ain't throwing no signs, claiming no colors or shit
But got that p-90 Ruger & it can get ugly in this bitch
My city watching my rearview, I'm speaking in codes
Cause I'm a gangsta & I stay in gangsta mode
Look I'm a gangsta

[Verse 2: Webbie]
Feast your eyes on a g, you suprised yeah it's me
Keep my eyes in the mirror, 45 on my seat
Ride by on them feet, I can ride on any street

All my niggas k-ed up, ready for what for what ever come
Yeah a nigga getting money stunting ain't no thing to me
Dem hoes saw my phantom coming thougt I was Jermaine Dupri
Just hollered at my nigga b, I told it's time to roll
He told me nigga I kno, I told him nigga let's go
Gangsta music 2 let's give the streets that on there
And I bet a million real niggas go get this bitch off the shelf
And bet lil niggas will love to, stop me & my lil thug to
Trill fenta lock it, bitch watch it me & my lil thug to
Everybody show us love, so us we just show them love to
You fuck with a busta, we bust him up, you get drugged to

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
I spit this shit from the bottom of my stomach
So try some I knock the bottom out ya stomach
It ain't nothing, momma like ooh my baby boy thugging
In love with guns & he can't stop clubbing
Never could tell him nothing
Fuck real g's, with big nuts who flip keys on highways
Player made niggas, man who flip hoes off myspace
Luxury in driveways let your roof back nigga
That half of pill ain't doing the job, then throw ya two back nigga
My time to shine niggas playing, but I'm bout my business
Last to drop, but off the top, the whole world know I'm the sickest
Red monkey's to dickies, nigga got every color
From yo stae to 28, niggas got many hustles
My brothers the trill fam, love me because I'm loyal
Dude keep his shit strapped, because my watch will get me kidnapped, from my block to yo trap
Niggas heads get bust, feds get dust
My trill niggas out here ready to bust
It's gangsta

[Hook: Lil Boosie]
Tanktop, big rocks, big Glocks
