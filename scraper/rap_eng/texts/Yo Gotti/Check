[Intro]
I got a check, check, check, check
Bitch I got a check, check, check
Bitch I got a check, check, check

[Hook]
I buy anything I want cause I got a check
Fuck any bitch I want cause I got a check
I only ride foreign cause I got a check
You know I’m fully armed, you ain’t gotta check
And everytime you se me I be on deck
Looking like money, smelling like a check
Brand new swag, got me on flex
Whole lot of cash, I’m a walking check

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Uhh,I got my check up,Ugh I need a check up
Watch on me so cold, chain on me so froze
Check, I got them hoes, check, designer clothes
I got them bows, plus I got them o’s
Going hard, nigga I do too
I got shooters nigga, what bout you
Valet park nigga there’s my coupe
Popping bottles nigga, there’s my crew
That pussy good, ass fat, head right, nigga that’s my boo
A real nigga, you ain’t one, hate on me, that’s what you do
Oo I’m in my zone, ooo, my money long
Sipping on that Ciroc, inhaling all of the strong
On my young nigga shit, rollie with the bezel
I’m on my rich nigga shit, Rolls Royce are better

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I put on for my city, go strong when I kick it
Got a bad girl’s club, a gang of bad bitches
Black diamond, ap, oil spill, bp, white diamond muerla
No diamond,pure blow, ace of spades, no cards
Don P that glow in the dark
I got soft, I go hard, stop the beat my favorite part
The California my favorite car
The last line was my favorite bar
I hit the club, my jays on, they ain't out yet
And stood on the box
Selling dope my first job, getting money, they worst thought
I’m in this bitch with my home boys
Big jewelry, no bodyguard
I pull up, like who this, thugged out, I do this
Checking on my dollar sign, get money on my to do list, hey!

Whole lot of cash, I’m a walking check
Check, check, bitch I’m on deck
Flexing, flexing, looking like a check

You know I’m fully armed, you ain’t gotta check
