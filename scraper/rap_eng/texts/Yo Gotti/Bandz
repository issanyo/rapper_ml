[Verse 1: Blac Youngsta]
I don't need a belt them bands they hold my pants up
I been broke all my life now I got my bands up
I just bought a new Ferrari and i chopped the doors off
I just drunk a pint of lean just so I can dose off
I got bad bitch out Toronto and she looking real thicke
She say her boyfriend don't like me i say he a real bitch
I got a foreign bih, foreign bih, she just wanna strip
I got a foreign clip, foreign clip, Glock up on my hip
Now a nigga ran up on me homie I took him out by myself
Ill do anything for you baby you know I love you to death
Every time I fall in Louie they say "sir you need a belt"
I'm like "hell naw lil bitch I got them bands I don't need no help"

[Hook: LunchMoney Lewis]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Damn, down to die about this Gucci belt
Thirteen with a draco man he fuck around and shoot his self
When I met Youngsta he said "big homie I'm with you to the death"
I told him "its CMG we go to war we never ask for help"
Bands on deck like a high school
Blood on my chain like a piru
Vet motor and a Chevrolet nigga want a wraith no i can't lose
Whole squad blessed like ha choo
[?]
I'm a street fighter like Ryu
Walk to the bank like "hi you"
We get money its not a question, are you niggas dumb?
Big ol crib in Beverly Hills but I know where I'm from
Eight figure nigga and drug dealer I went number one
Street nigga slash superstar slash keep my gun

[Hook: LunchMoney Lewis]
I don't need a belt these bands they hold my pants up
Hold my pants up
I don't need a belt these bands they hold my pants up
Hold my pants up
I don't need a belt these bands they hold my pants up
Hold my pants up

Hold my pants up

[Verse 3: Blac Youngsta]
Pants up
Pants up
Young and black
And handsome
Ima burn
Her top up
Free my dawgs
That's locked up
When I take off in that Lamb you know it kick rocks up
Go to war with me you know you need your Glock tucked
Soon as you get rich you know them haters pop up
You know haters respect haters you know they gone flock up
That nigga ran up on me homie I took him out by myself
Ill do anything for you baby you know I love you to death
Every time I fall in Gucci they like "sir you need a belt"
I'm like "hell naw lil bitch I got them bands I don't need no help

[Hook: LunchMoney Lewis]
I don't need a belt these bands they hold my pants up
Hold my pants up

[Outro: Blac Youngsta]
