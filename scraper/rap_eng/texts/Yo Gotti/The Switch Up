Rap god, rap god, rap god, I ain’t need a rapper to cosign me
Brand new drop top no miles, inside dark like closed eyes
And I might pull up at your hoe house
Small town nigga but I’m worldwide
Man I blew the check like I’m verified
You know them niggas ride in their spare time
Boy I been the shit since ’05, no I been the shit this whole time
I got the juice, like I threw Pac off the roof
My shooters hop out in suits, no way in hell he could not be this cool
No I’m no novice, I’m out on the move
She wanna hang like a knot in a noose
I fool a genius when I play the fool
Future so bright you forgot who was who
Straight to the money my pockets on jew

Put the bitch on block we don’t do that
Could’ve put her on the spot we don’t do that

I ain’t got no feeling wanna leave bitch gone
I ain't got no opinions, no rights, no wrongs
Say I am what I am bitch and I ain’t gone change
Eighty on the watch, two fifty on the chain
We drink champagne, just to swallow with the pain
Ain’t gone change shit cause I owe it to the game
Shootout in the ‘rari reup in the range
Fuck her in the wraith just to put her on game
Let her see the stars just to put it on her brain

[Verse 3: Nick Grant]
Young nigga never need a handout
Still they wanna give a nigga dap now
Tell my old girl I’m the man now
Yeah I had everything planned out
When I had nothing niggas ran out
Now they hit the phone for the whereabouts
No I ain’t saying I’m a street nigga, but I was home alone in the trap house
Yeah nigga, mama was a shooter, yeah you know my daddy was a hustler
Fucked around made a real dope nigga, got trouble when I’m going through customs
Yeah I took my niggas through a few doors
But when you in the crib take your shoes off
Riding through the city with my new broad
And she love the Bay like Too $hort
Dance on the money like Mike
Niggas sell they soul for some likes
Feel like Ai with the cross, no I ain’t relying on the right
Yeah I’m in the bank for the heist, broke niggas keep your advice
Yeah I’m a standout nigga, like Frank Luc at the fight, yikes
