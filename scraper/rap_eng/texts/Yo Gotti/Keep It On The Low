And bring it to the do'
And bring it to the do'
But keep it and keep it
But keep it and keep it
But keep it on the low
And bring it to the do'
Butkeep it on the low
Don't let nobody know
You bought the shit from Yo
You gotta play it off
You know I rap now
Don't get it twisted though
I'm still strapped man
I still vote for my people I got insurance
Don't miss the blowout sale it's on clearance
And bring it to the do'
But keep it on the low
Don't let nobody know
You bought the shit from Yo

[Verse]
I'm from the North Pole, they call me Young Santa
I'm movin' bricks from Memphis clean to Atlanta
And everythang in between
Them niggas down in Cashville payin' 900 for a pound of green
When the sun rise I got a lot of fiends
I'm sellin' 20 rocks the same size as lima beans (two for one)
You want to purchase one get the second half off
But this ain't dealers nigga I'ma blow your ass off
If I ain't in my Benz you see me in a rental
I'm bout to rap with a 9 piece chicken dinner
You know they goin' fast better get with me nigga
45 for the home team rest of you 250 nigga
A thousand grams of white that'll bring me 20 stacks
If it ain't comin' in a wrapper I'ma ship it back
Cause niggas steppin' on the shit and recompressin' it
But I don't plan on payin' them anyway so I ain't stressin' it

[Hook]
And bring it to the do'
But keep it on the low
Don't let nobody know
You bought that shit from Yo
You gotta play it off
You know I rap now
Don't get it twisted though
I'm still strapped man
I still vote for my people I got insurance
Don't miss the blowout sale it's on clearance
And bring it to the do'
But keep it on the low
Don't let nobody know
You bought that shit from Yo

[Verse]
You work a small shift I'm pullin' all nighters
You got no hustle but Gotti got the titles
New school hard top old school  drop top
Flipflop got the yellow and the white rock
Lit up like a chandelier diamonds shinin' everywhere
And not to mention I'm a cash money millionaire
While you fantasize and dreamin' bout a hundred stacks
I'm coast to coast and across the border tryna get a sack
My main bitch she a soldier and she ride with me
The people scooped her tried to turn her to an eye witness
But I ain't worried about it cause she ain't seen shit
My lawyer say I'm good but I don't trust him they don't mean shit
They say you kill a nigga that shit be on your conscience
They say I'm young and having money so I'm money laundering
Bullshit nigga, I got that show paper
That ten here, ten there, that fo sho paper

[Hook]
And bring it to the do'
But keep it on the low
Don't let nobody know
You bought the shit from Yo
You gotta play it off
You know I rap now
Don't get it twisted though
I'm still strapped man
I still vote for my people I got insurance
Don't miss the blowout sale it's on clearance
And bring it to the do'
But keep it on the low
Don't let nobody know
You bought the shit from Yo

[Verse]
When the law's in front I play it off
Catch a charge I pay it off
Trunk full of white see blue lights I'm goin' out like set it off
Hundred years nigga fuck that shit
Thousands knots you bet that shit
Cop a plea, tell on my niggas? real niggas don't accept that shit
With 0 tolerance sweep we be landlords
For 16.5 a pop they bring it to the door
Like I'ma tell em no shit what the fuck for
I know some niggas out south payin' 20 for it
I'm tryna profit 8 all night all day
Once a week five ten go and cop that new Benz
Yayo got my ass in, bullshit got your ass out
Whoever said crime don't pay don't know what they talkin' bout
In the hood my credit good
Old school with plenty wood
Stop and go's, 24's, got it all from slangin' O's
Yea, got it all from slangin' O's, 24's,  stop and go's

[Hook]
And bring it to the do'

You bought the shit from Yo
