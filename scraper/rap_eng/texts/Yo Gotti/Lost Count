Turn Up Yea (A fool With it) Im Lody
These niggas ain't Dj Iceberg
Dj Grady
Im like bumdadunn
Foolish Mixtape

(Chorus)
I lost Count, I lost count
I lost Count, I lost count
Too Many twenties, they on the ground
Too many Hundreds Laying around
(2x)

(Lil Lody)
Fresh off the road, back on the grind
Lody 2x its time to shine
So I went and bought a new whip
And I bought me a new Nine
That Lambo yea that bitch mine
They say different They ass Lien
They mad cause I dont fuck with them
They tried but then they got declined
I swear I lost my damn mind
And then that bitch so hard to find
I lost count of my money too
My niggas say thats a bad sign
I told them that its all good
That means Im making too much
I hustle like its two of me
So the broke niggas gotta catch up

(Chorus 2x)

(Yo Gotti)

Million dollar ago I lost count
Need a brinks Truck
Right behind that Lambo all white
With the doors up
Showed that Bitch a half a million cash
And she froze up
Now her friends tryna fuck a nigga
Bitch done chose up
I been on Tour in Mexico
30 day run
Ryder got them bricks with scorpio stamps
Come and get you one
House look like a luxury car lot
Nigga, pick you one
You ain't got your bread up, Fuck it I'll rent you one
Ten Mil, get you one
Glock 19 with extension up
Hustle hard every time from the game
Real dope boy got my pension up
Hustler of the year I ain't got no deal
Me and my Family ain't skip no meals
My plug 100 he dont go on strike
Now damn my sack nigga I be like

(chorus 2x)
