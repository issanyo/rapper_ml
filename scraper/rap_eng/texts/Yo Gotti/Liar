[Chorus]
Youse a muhfuckin' liar
Bitch that purse ain't yours
Them ass shots, them ain't real curves
Youse a muhfuckin' liar
You don't suck dick, you don't swallow
You done took a couple pics, now you a model
Youse a muhfuckin' liar
You actin' an ass with your taxes
But when April roll around you back relaxin'
Youse a muhfuckin' liar
You got head a head full of Yaki
And got the nerve to be in the club actin'

[Verse 1]
You only fuck with nigga money
But you a muhfuckin booster
Her money ain't even what you used to
Petty ass hoes, freak ass, red ass hoes
I'm tired of you pathetic ass hoes
Heard the word ratchet?
Where your kids, where your job
Where you live, what you do, where your car?
Bitch you got it bad, but wanna blame your baby daddy
Know he gave it to you when he had it
Bitch I heard you on, fire
I don't wanna fuck you anyway
Health department might come get you any day
Bitch you need pray, cause you let anybody hit it
Fuck these hoes, man they anybody bitches

[Chorus]
Youse a muhfuckin' liar
Bitch that purse ain't yours
Them ass shots, them ain't real curves
Youse a muhfuckin' liar
You don't suck dick, you don't swallow
You done took a couple pics, now you a model
Youse a muhfuckin' liar
You actin' an ass with your taxes
But when April roll around you back relaxin'
Youse a muhfuckin' liar
You got head a head full of Yaki
And got the nerve to be in the club actin'

[Verse 2]
I just met this little bad bitch
And she say she don't fuck with niggas
But my nigga he an already hit her
These bitches be confused
Heard you went half on some Choo's
Bitch them ain’t Jimmy Choo’s them Jimmy Who's
This bitch was kinda fake, ain't gon' lie I tried to help her
But I see why her last nigga left her
I gotta give respect, cause this bitch'll write a check
Have a nigga fresh from his feet to his neck
Bigshot ass ho, say you charging niggas
But you beggin'
Triflin ass hoes, sharing leggings
Bitch you need pray, cause you let anybody hit it
Fuck these hoes, man they anybody bitches

[Chorus]
Youse a muhfuckin' liar
Bitch that purse ain't yours
Them ass shots, them ain't real curves
Youse a muhfuckin' liar
You don't suck dick, you don't swallow
You done took a couple pics, now you a model
Youse a muhfuckin' liar
You actin' an ass with your taxes
But when April roll around you back relaxin'
Youse a muhfuckin' liar
You got head a head full of Yaki
And got the nerve to be in the club actin'
