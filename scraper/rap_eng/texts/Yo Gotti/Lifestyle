[Hook: LunchMoney Lewis & Yo Gotti]
Jesus from the ghetto, nigga, so am I
I'm like God to you niggas
I said Jesus from the ghetto, nigga, so am I
I'm like God to you niggas
That's my lifestyle
Lifestyle, nigga white
Girl, white power, white cloud , iced out
That's my lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle
That's my lifestyle
I'm like god to you niggas

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
We go bricks, all white bricks
Cocaine music man, I'm on that same shit
Just put a hunnid fifty on my same wrist
I used to whip-whip-whip-whip-whip with Tip
Fuck around got residue on my Patek
Fucked around and got pulled over, tail light out in the Vette
Ridin' dirty and if they search, I know I'm headed to the feds
Once they ask me for license and registration you know I fled (I'm outta here)
Nigga talkin' 'bout front 'em something, he outta here
For next nigga try owe me somethin' just hear me loud and clear
Don't do credit or finances, strip clubs, I don't do dances
Just throw my money up and watch it come down on the dancers
Put my money up so I can double up with Hector
If he ain't no hustler, he ain't get no money, I don't respect it
All that tough shit gon' get you killed nigga
And that ra-ra talkin' how I'm built nigga

[Hook: LunchMoney Lewis & Yo Gotti]
Jesus from the ghetto, nigga, so am I
I'm like God to you niggas
I said Jesus from the ghetto, nigga, so am I
I'm like God to you niggas
That's my lifestyle
Lifestyle, nigga white
Girl, white power, white cloud , iced out
That's my lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle
That's my lifestyle
I'm like god to you niggas

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Dough boy of the century, I'm God to the hood
I just parked a half a million dollar car in the hood
I sell crack to my community, tryna get on
Sometimes I think about that shit like was I wrong?
God bless the trap and hallelujah to the kitchen
Bless the chef that came before me and fuck the ones who owe me
This my gift from God and it my talent
Now I'm talkin' dope on Jimmy Fallon
Man I live the life these niggas kill for
Trill nigga on the billboard
I just robbed the AM more
I just killed the Louis store
I'm like God to these niggas
So gangster, I get money, still gon' ra on thes niggas
Fuck it, ski mask, ski mask, ski mask
The kitchen like a slope, I'm bakin' up a ski batch
Gave the wrong nigga money, I'ma make these streets mad
I'm a walkin' blessing, I get everybody bags nigga

[Hook: LunchMoney Lewis & Yo Gotti]
Jesus from the ghetto, nigga, so am I
