[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
Pull up to the trap
Peekin' out the peephole
Give you two shots
Like I'm shootin' free throws
Cubans on my neck
That's a lot of kilos
Pack touch down
So now I'm on reload
Pull up to the trap (pull up)
Peekin' out the peephole (who that?)
Give you two shots (bow bow)
Like I'm shootin' free throws (ha)
Cubans on my neck (Cubans)
That's a lot of kilos (kilos)
Pack touch down (it's here)
So now I'm on reload (reload)

[Verse 1: MoneyBagg Yo]
(Federal, federal, fed, ugh, ugh, ugh
2 Fed, federal, federal, federal)
Pull up in my trap car
Hit the traphouse dishin' that dope out
Hop out with that stick out
Please don't trip out, I might flip out
I know a Cuban, he don't speak Englo
I need a translator (I need some better talk)
Give me whatever I need on consignment
Told me to pay him later (throw that shine young nigga)
I heard the car pull up outside
I looked out the blindfold (who that? Who that?)
That my stupid ass baby mama
Think I'm in here with side hoes (stupid bitch)
Bitch I'm in here with nine bows (right now)
Tryna get the whole nine sold (right now)
You make a scene, causing commotion
Trying to give me some time ho? (What you 12 or something?)
Walk in your trap and take over your trap, I'm like Bankroll (Fresh)
Come and take your shit, repo (give me that)
Make you tuck your shit, Debo, hey, hey
I'm so ahead of them, check out my schedule
Gotti and MoneyBagg, ooh that's 2Federal
Fuck what they talking 'bout, I'm running up revenue
Go do the same, that's what you better do

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
Pull up to the trap
Peekin' out the peephole
Give you two shots
Like I'm shootin' free throws
Cubans on my neck
That's a lot of kilos
Pack touch down
So now I'm on reload
Pull up to the trap (pull up)
Peekin' out the peephole (who that?)
Give you two shots (bow bow)
Like I'm shootin' free throws (ha)
Cubans on my neck (Cubans)
That's a lot of kilos (kilos)
Pack touch down (it's here)
So now I'm on reload (reload)

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
MoneyBagg and Gotti (2Federal)
It's like we got the cheat codes
We talk nothin' but gangster shit and get money with chicos
CMG the label
And we distribute kilos
And we'll spend your budget (on what?)
On foreign whips with two doors (ugh)
I'm 2Federal, a nigga talkin' shit, etcetera, etcetera
You a little hater, it fit your character, character
I'll fuck around and embarrass you
Hold up, listen
Tell a nigga I made twenty million would you believe me?
Young nigga told me he made a hundred thousand listening to that me and Jeezy, I believe him
I was trap or dyin', get rich or die trapping (what else?)
'Fore I made Cocaine Muzik Five (what else?)
Ran off on the plug with seventy-five (what else?)
I was robbing niggas, runnin' with the guys
(Young nigga grindin', trying to get a nine)
But the price up
Everybody telling me to drop that CM9, the streets dry

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
Pull up to the trap (pull up)
Peekin' out the peephole (who that?)
Give you two shots (bow bow)
Like I'm shootin' free throws (ha)
Cubans on my neck (Cubans)
That's a lot of kilos (kilos)
Pack touch down (it's here)
So now I'm on reload (reload)
Pull up to the trap (pull up)
Peekin' out the peephole (who that?)
Give you two shots (bow bow)
Like I'm shootin' free throws (ha)
Cubans on my neck (Cubans)
That's a lot of kilos (kilos)
Pack touch down (it's here)
So now I'm on reload (reload)
