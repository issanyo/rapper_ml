[Intro]
It's 24 hours
It's 12:am
Apex a boss
(M-m-murda)
Apex a boss

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
I was young and in heaven
24hrs down at Magic
Niggas try to count me out
I don't know what that's about
20 days, 40 reckless
20 boss stuck quick
Girlfriend wanna pic
Record label talkin' slick
I'm at Follies day shift
Rappin' niggas be lyin'
I'm up in the booth flyin'
Eatin' wings n' propane
20, I've been the boss
20, I've been ran it up
20, it's my time to shine
20, I'm takin' what's mine

[Hook: 24hrs]
I was takin' opportunities
I was workin' like it's two of me
Labels ain't know what to do with me
All along they was losin' me
All along they was losin' me
This 20 revenge, this 20 revenge

[Verse 2: 24hrs]
This 20 revenge, you act like my friends
That shit was pretend
Seen real niggas fold
Never sold my soul
24 finna glow
AMG smokin' dope
24 finna glow
AMG smokin' dope
I made my lil young nigga rich
20 a boss and won't switch
I'm all bout the profit
Y3 in my closet
These bitches ain't shit
In love with a goddess
I roll by the pound
I swear I'm a smoker
Got 20 on me and 20 on my diamond choker
20 a boss and 20 ain't trippin'
Come to my city and see how I'm livin'

[Hook: 24hrs]
I was takin' opportunities
I was workin' like it's two of me
Labels ain't know what to do with me
All along they was losin' me
All along they was losin' me
This 20 revenge, all along they was losin' me

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Big business nigga, me and 20
I'm the king of doin' it independent
I was sellin' bricks when they was under 20
Plug was comin' through and dumpin' plenty
I be hustlin' like it's two of me
They don't know what to do with me
Cut the check and keep them bitches comin'
Labels know it's CMG with me
Niggas ain't want to deal with me
LA Reid, he kept it real with me
He take a boss and make another boss
And he done made a lot of M's with me
I always kept a private plug
Fuck a bitch I keep it private cuz
This that CMG mixed with Private Club

[Hook: 24hrs]
I was takin' opportunities
I was workin' like it's two of me
Labels ain't know what to do with me
All along they was losin' me
All along they was losin' me
This 20 revenge, all along they was losin' me
