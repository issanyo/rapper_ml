Yo Gotti:
I Am
Aye this that street classic nigga
Streets talk
Reason to doubt a nigga
Reason to doubt a nigga
Reason to out a nigga
Reason to clap a nigga
Living in poverty no reason to doubt a nigga

Grew up listening to Jay
College drop out like Ye'
Brother jailing up state
Yeah he serving a eight
Momma worrying and stressing
Meanwhile I'm helping
Adding onto the problem
Thinking I'm sorry
Momma I don't wanna see you hurting no more
Got a plan momma, you ain't gotta work no more

Family struggling, niggas is hustling
No reason for reasoning
They blaming the government

Tryna stack cheese thicker than the government
Two twin bricks and I call em the doublemint
Immigration laws, I don't follow that
I got Mexican friends and the streets loving it
I got plug and I ain't talking where the gangs at
Columbian shit, nigga I can go direct
Cause they a blanco nigga, the head haunch o nigga
Hundred bands on your head, show you that ain't your nigga
Put a ring, or it ain't your bitch
Put in work on that mission or it ain't ya lick
Put ya title on the line, or it ain't ya whip
You got keys to the crib but what about ownership
Huh, boss shit I'm on the next level
Rolli watch no stones, sky dweller
AP rose gold that's a buck 80
All I want was a key of coke and a new Mercedes
I was born in the 80's, get money in the 90's
I'm a real hustler aiming
Baking soda pot, watch it rise and rock
Take it to the block, seven hundred a pop

Shoutout to my Dominicans
Ridgecrest Afghanistan, we militant

DJ Drama:
I am, The greatest
I am, king
I am the streets
I am quality street music
I am November 19th
Yo Gotti
I am
Lets exercise of you niggas
