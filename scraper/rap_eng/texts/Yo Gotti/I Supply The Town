[Hook: Eldorado Red]
When I come around, I supply your town
None but bricks and pounds, yeah, I supply your town
I supply your town
I supply your town
I supply your town, yeah, I supply your town
When I come around, None but bricks and pounds
I supply your town, When I come around, yeah
I supply your town
I supply your town
I supply your town, yeah, I supply your town
When I come around

[Verse 1: Eldorado Red]
Tractor trailer, eighteen wheela
I'm El Jefe, Meet the deala!
Bricks and pounds, When I come around
No city too big, I flood the town
BGM crime boss, What you know about it
Hundred bricks in the car, Im finna snow about it
I got smack, I got crack, I got what you need
Stupid Cali plug, all type of Kush weed
Fuck with the mob, guarantee you gonna eat
Feds rushin' in, guaranteed I won't speak
Death before dishonor, that's my code of honor
Threw my middle finger up, and said fuck y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Yo Gotti]
Eldorado the lieutenant
CMG the mob we get money and we winnin'
Ridge-crest the hood my nigga got them birds
Into it with these suckas, so you know we hit the burner
Mouth full of green, my nigga call me turnips
In the kitchen beatin' the pot, like I'm ike and tina turner
Im Yo Gotti the plug, and when I'm in your city
Just know before the show, I downed a couple of chickens
I made a couple tickets, I call a lot of shots
I made a lot of plays, I've seen a lot of blocks
Knife on the Kay, Extended on them Glocks
Thirty eight revolvers, and the bitch got six shots

[Hook]
