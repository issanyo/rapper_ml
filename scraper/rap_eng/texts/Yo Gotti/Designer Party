Verse 1
Alexander threw a party in my closet
And invited Balenciaga
Margiela had a party in my closet
And they just had a funeral for Versace (damn)
Givenchy had a party in my closet
And he brought a pair of Yeezy's
So much white it likes a snowman in my closet, and i ain't talkin' Jeezy
Don't trust a bank so I got money in my closet
[?] we don't do deposits
$450 in the attic
Fuck it i might go buy me a 'Rarri'
And a brand new automatic
Boy i got that loud on the low low
Dress up like a [?] rockin' polo
No True
