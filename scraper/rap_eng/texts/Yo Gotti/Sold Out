I'm Yo Gotti!

[Chorus]
Pulled up at the show
Half a brick of blow
12 pack of goose, quarter pound of dro
This b*tch is sold out (4x)

We do it for the goons
Sellin' out the club
Fish scale tour
Ain't what you thought it was
This b*tch is sold out (4x)

[Verse 1]
This Yo Gotti
Mic check 1, 2

I love you guys (white girls)
I love you too (Yo Gotti)

We got this motherf*cker jumpin off the hinges
Ni*gas throwing gang signs, b*tches in a frenzy

Lined up outside they said this motherf*cker sold out
Word on the count they said that motherf*cker showed out

He ain't had the platinum on, but girl he broke the gold out
DJ played that gangsta sh*t, the waitress brought the rolls out

Dope boy fresh, yeah they brought some 24's out
Them hatas stayed at home, but I bet I brought their ho*s out

HAHAHA yeah I said I brought their ho*s out
Before I leave their city man, I'm burning up their ho*s mouths

[Chorus]
Pulled up at the show
Half a brick of blow
12 pack of goose, quarter pound of dro
This b*tch is sold out (4x)

We do it for the goons
Sellin' out the club
Fish scale tour
Ain't what you thought it was
This b*tch is sold out (4x)

[Verse 2]
50 dollar hat, hundred on the chain
Thousand dollar jeans, I come to do my thing

50 on the wanch, twanky on the ring
Bass hitting hard, club off the chain

Fire marshall tripping, they want to shut us down

Laws raid the club, they try to shake us down

Helicopter high, we ain't coming down
You ain't smokin these, this sh*t from out of town

Goons on stage, security in the crowd
B*tches pull my shirt, plus they want my towels

They say you cool as hell, and you ain't hollywood
I say I'm real as hell, because I come from the hood

[Chorus]
Pulled up at the show
Half a brick of blow
12 pack of goose, quarter pound of dro
This b*tch is sold out (4x)

We do it for the goons
Sellin' out the club
Fish scale tour
Ain't what you thought it was
This b*tch is sold out (4x)

[Verse 3]
Wanna book a show, tell me when and where
A half a brick - could be a dro, I'll meet you there

Hotel exclusive, ni*gas be playing games
With all that monkey sh*t, I'm knocking out your brains

I'm a hood ni*ga, dog I know the game
Ni*ga want my watch, ni*ga want my chain

Catch me in your city, walkin through the mall
And I ain't in your city, if I ain't strapped dog

I'm a bad b*tch, I picked through them all
But I ain't f*cking nothing, if I ain't strapped dog

Ni*ga started fighting, f*cked up the night
Yeah it's been a ball, but I gotta catch a flight

[Chorus]
Pulled up at the show
Half a brick of blow
12 pack of goose, quarter pound of dro
This b*tch is sold out (x4)

We do it for the goons
Sellin' out the club
Fish scale tour
Ain't what you thought it was
This b*tch is sold out (x4)
