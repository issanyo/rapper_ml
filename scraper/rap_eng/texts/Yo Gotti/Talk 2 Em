[Intro: Yo Gotti]
A nigga a motherfucking brand
Like What a nigga stand on
Nigga gone die on that shit because
Niggas turn up for that shit
These Niggas in the streets don't understand
What a Nigga talkin about
This shit more than music nigga
This shit a lifestyle
You got Niggas in the fed Niggas in the graveyard behind this shit


[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
L.A. Reid put the building on me
I Am surprised a nigga fucked up the streets
They tryin to say that I'm the underdog
But really they talking money I'm not under y'all
I dropped the record with cole
And they like woah he can rap
They put my shit on a blog Site like gotti Just snapped
And I'm like fuck wrong with these Niggas I been in the trap
And I been rapping the same since I first got on the map
I guess these industry Niggas don't pay attention to content
Because I come from the Hood they think I'm talking that nonsense
Bitch I was struggling my life sacrifice for my family
Selling dope pulling plays everyday gambling
Fuck a Grammy Fuck any award I want money boy
?door brand new rolls Royce no tonka toy
Rollie watches for the whole team
They like trophies
Realest shit you ever seen
Do you know this nigga
Bought my Nigga a stingray and my Nigga an Ashton
Them the same Niggas that was with me bringing them bricks I carried
I motivate Niggas I don't talk down on Niggas
I put on all my Niggas holding down all my niggas
My brothers is my Niggas cause we like brothers
We family ride or die for each other



[Verse 2: Wave Chapelle]
I swear that I'd die for this shit ride for this shit
All you Niggas do is lying and shit
I'm king of the jungle I'm lion and shit
You ain't riding the wave then you riding then you lie in a Ditch
I'm sizzling hot like I'm frying some fish
Came from the gutter put on for my click
6 months in the making that shit kinda quick
I rather stand out I ain't trying to fit
Wait and I ain't trying to diss
It's cmg everybody who we better than
Young Ricky but I spit it like a veteran
Working late night like David Letterman
Yea homie witness the takeover
Better get to work cause your breaks over
Too real and you Niggas Just fake soldiers
I'm not high but I rap like I ain't sober
Like I lost my mind I swear to God it's like I lost my mind
They let me loose so it's about that time
You know it's a rap you ever cross that line
I run up my bands through the brackets
Stack so much paper it look like a package
Can't touch my green boy that shit like a cactus
If you don't listen my hitters attack ya
Ride around town with a piece that's attractive
The Park i come from man that shit is Jurassic
Watch em fall down homie ashes to ashes
My money stretch like that shit is elastic
Uh gotti taught you Niggas how to act Right
I'm gone teach you Niggas how to rap Right
All over the world homie I am like a satellite
Niggas wanna feature like What is that price
I spit some shit so cold they like is that ice
They sleeping on me What that nap like
Compare to the greats What I rap like
Jay Z Nas Nigga I'm that nice
Uh and I'm on the frontline
I'm feeling like a warrior Right now
Gotti told me this was more than rap
He told me it was more like a lifestyle
That's it I gotta get it I guess we'll converse after
Cmg welcome to the first chapter
