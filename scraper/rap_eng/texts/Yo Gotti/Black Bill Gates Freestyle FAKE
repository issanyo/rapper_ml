40 dollar jeans, thousand dollar shades
Walk up in the club like a KKK parade
DJ scream my name, bitches turn they head
Light sign on my section, i holla can i get some head
I dont need no jewelry, and i dont need no goons
Wherever i might stand, im the realist nigga in the room
Never cop a plea , and dont throw in the towel
Gangsta, and you know it, fuck it take them hoes to trial
(Nigga we dont cop no pleas pussy, nigga our money right, lawyers paid. p12 nigga, CM5 bitch)
I got money on my mind, bitches in my bed
Problems in my household, niggas in the feds
Yeah them my dogs, so i collect they calls
Record label bullshittin, put my shit on pause
Cause i won't make no single commercial shit i rap for yall
So fuck the industry, and my enemies kill them all
Bullet in the chamber, bitch yo life in danger
Mama never told you dont be conversating with strangers
I owe God a favor, He send me a angel
Niggas tried to kill me, He made sure i had a banger
Now i got to thank ya, proud to be a gangsta
Past the Beale Street, nigga fuck being famous
*Laugh*
Nigga i want the muthafucking money nigga
No attention pussy, gangsta shit nigga, CM5
It goes light, camera, action, Franklins, Grants, Jacksons
Money in my mattress, im tryna fuck a actress
My life like a movie, but i dont do no acting
I just keep it gangsta with my North Memphis accent
What it do pimp, whats up man, whats happenin bruh, nothin mane
How ya people be, gud mane, you knw errthng errthng
I just bought a white meat, it look like a polar bear
Baby mama touch ha toes, smack ha a$$, pull ha hair
4g out on wheels, i just call ha stop and stare
Daddies on da benz, and it remind me of a rocking chair
I got bitches errwhere, california, delaware
Haters in my peripheral and i can smell it in da air
Cool but ain't no cylinder, truth but yea im feelin her
99 point 9 percent, she fuckin dem, she get in der
