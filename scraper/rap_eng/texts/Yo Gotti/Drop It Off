[Intro-Yo Gotti]
This some gangster shit
Nigga before all the lights, cameras and action nigga
It was pitch black dark, niggas with ski masks
Niggas with choppers, don't take one to the bottom of their shoes
Niggas who good, you know what time it is

[Chorus-Yo Gotti]
Got to get my ass in, got to get my ass in
Got to get my, got to get my, got to get my hands in
Drop it off, drop it off, drop it off, drop it off
Drop it off, drop it off, drop it off, drop it off
Got to get my, got to get my, got to get my ass in
Got to get my ass in, got to get my ass in
Drop it off, drop it off, drop it off, drop it off
Drop it off, drop it off, drop it off, drop it off

[Verse 1-Yo Gotti]
Face down, nigga
Play if you want to homie
Strap in your face, bitch
Niggas know they don't want it
No it ain't no secret
Niggas coming to get it
Don't be looking surprised
You know a nigga will get it
Niggas roll in their grave
No Memphis walk-ins like Brown
Niggas show us their work
And we laying that ass down
Hundred G's are better
Niggas going to get hurt
Ten stacks in the morgue
Of niggas that get murked
Hiding in the bushes with choppers and all black
Fuck you in the house and that's where they stash it
Damn, my home murked so I know it's in here
And if I'm wrong bitch, I'll make you wish it was here
Whoop his ass, Cut his head, do him bad with the pistols
Pull the trigger baby Mrs. gonna phone people
Niggas get money, working with the set
Know they business, when I hit the door they holla words back

[Chorus-Yo Gotti]
Got to get my ass in, got to get my ass in
Got to get my, got to get my, got to get my ass in
Drop it off, drop it off, drop it off, drop it off
Drop it off, drop it off, drop it off, drop it off
Got to get my ass in, got to get my ass in
Got to get my, got to get my, got to get my ass in
Drop it off, drop it off, drop it off, drop it off
Drop it off, drop it off, drop it off, drop it off

[Verse 2- La Chat]
I'm maxed out, got to get my ass in
Got to come up on a couple of stacks before the weekend
Load up my 45 ready to go on a mission
Trying to see which one of these suckers I can catch slippin'
Is it you, with the 22's, perfect for my deuce deuce
Drop it off, bitch before I put your life on snooze snooze
Tie your ass up to the bumper of my dark truck
Playing with the gas, it's your ass on my hand bruh
Take me to your stash in the basement of your mommy's house
Need to move fast before I blast, pistol in your mouth
Fucking with these bitches, and you know these hoes talk
Laughing, bragging about some shit that they feign that they saw
Overheard your conversation and they act like I ain't listen much
Scope your ass out, caught you slipping while you pissing
No waiting on the pay day, flying on the get away
Get the units there and throw my hat away

[Chorus-Yo Gotti]
Got to get my ass in, got to get my ass in
Got to get my, got to get my, got to get my ass in
Drop it off, drop it off, drop it off, drop it off
Drop it off, drop it off, drop it off, drop it off
Got to get my ass in, got to get my ass in
Got to get my, got to get my, got to get my ass in
Drop it off, drop it off, drop it off, drop it off
Drop it off, drop it off, drop it off, drop it off

[Verse 3-Allstar]
Ride through the east side
Cash through my stumpy grounds
When street lights come on
Weak niggas don't come around
'Cause you niggas be robbing me
You don't want no problems
When it's going down, I'm the only one who can stop them
I call the shots, I'm a dawg, I don't play at all
Knows where you're from, who the boss
I'ma break them all
Situations get drastic about that paper dawg
Get a call, "I got your baby momma nigga pay the cost"
I keep a full clip that'll wake you up
Hoe, I could get your main bitch to come and set you up
Niggas say they ain't going, I'm like ok
I bet he changes tune with a 40 in his face
Catch a nigga slipping I'm going to take him off his feet
And I don't mean no harm, but my people got to eat
That's how it is, yea that's how it's got to be
Shit, it's better you than me, drop it off nigga

[Chorus-Yo Gotti]
Got to get my ass in, got to get my ass in
Got to get my, got to get my, got to get my ass in
Drop it off, drop it off, drop it off, drop it off
Drop it off, drop it off, drop it off, drop it off
Got to get my ass in, got to get my ass in
Got to get my, got to get my, got to get my ass in
Drop it off, drop it off, drop it off, drop it off
Drop it off, drop it off, drop it off, drop it off

[Outro-Yo Gotti]
So that's how it's going to be, huh?!
You want us to keep putting in work like it's nothing?!
Well then so be it
I told y'all niggas yesterday, I'ma tell you to stop
