[Hook: Plane Jaymes]
Oh you got that water wet (drip)
Thang drippin' like a faucet
She say, "Are you thirsty?" (drip)
And I want that water, I want that water
Oh she got that water wet (drip)
Thang drippin' like a faucet
She say, "Are you thirsty?" (drip)
And I want that water, I want that wet water

[Verse 1: Plane Jaymes]
Your ho love when I'm on the mic
She just hopped right on my dick, like her first day on a bike
Freak for life, for the longest I've been tryna bust her pipes
Call it thirsty if you want, quench my thirst, no Sprite
She remind me of, a supersoaker gun
Pump after pump, yup, here that trigger finger come
That pussy slide down my tongue, she turn that fire hydrant on
This girl on fire, she smokin', I pull my hose out and go in
Damn what's her Zodiac? She must be a water sign
Shit I'm lookin' forward to that night when the stars align
Cause I got a big dipper and shawty a big dripper
Thirsty, thirsty, yep, I need a sip of her

[Hook: Plane Jaymes]
Oh you got that water wet (drip)
Thang drippin' like a faucet
She say, "Are you thirsty?" (drip)
And I want that water, I want that water
Oh she got that water wet (drip)
Thang drippin' like a faucet
She say, "Are you thirsty?" (drip)
And I want that water, I want that wet water

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Drip, faucet, water park
Hips, ass, extra large
Shawty slip and slide, word to Trick and Trina
Hurricane shawty, pussy on Katrina
I'm drownin' in sin
Shawty, so deep in her wet, you'll need a float to go in
All of my bitches a hunnit
Just like the 'moji, so you know I'm gon' win
Strap up before I go in
Strap up before I go out, I'm strapped up with towels
When she pull it down, cause she like a water gun
She shoot it out
In that pussy like a doctor visit
All this ass, I gots to hit it
This my bitch, nigga, how I'm trickin'?
All that cash, I got to spend it
When you're thirsty, it's huntin' time
And that ain't no punchline
Let me hit it at lunchtime
Round 3 and it's crunchtime

[Hook: Plane Jaymes]
Oh you got that water wet (drip)
Thang drippin' like a faucet
She say, "Are you thirsty?" (drip)
And I want that water, I want that water
Oh she got that water wet (drip)
Thang drippin' like a faucet
She say, "Are you thirsty?" (drip)
And I want that water, I want that wet water
