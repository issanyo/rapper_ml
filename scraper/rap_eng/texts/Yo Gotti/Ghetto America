Dear Ghetto America
A letter from the hood I'm from
From every nigga in the trap, every nigga in the slums
Dear Ghetto America
Someone tell the president
My hood like Afghanistan, armed and we pay the rent
Dear Ghetto America
Tell Iraq I got that oil, got that purple, got that yellow
Nigga what you're paying for?
Dear Ghetto America
Invested in my private stock
Cocaine music group, CMG, all white block
Dear Ghetto America
Work but I don't bust no clock
Work but I don't bust no clock
Work but I don bust no clock
Dear Ghetto America
You want me to drop dead
But instead me & Gotti came through in that drop head
Dear Ghetto America
Want me downtown doing time but instead I'm with the industry doing mine
Dear Ghetto America
Lock me up for residue, won't get jobs cause felons well that's
Every nigga in my crew

Dear Ghetto America, land of the thugs
Land of the thugs, land of the drugs
Dear Ghetto America, in God we trust and power
Knocking down two tal thick bitches twin towers
Dear Ghetto America
Dear Ghetto America
I pledge allegiance, nigga
Dear Ghetto America, right hand to God
Dear Ghetto America Other hand to the strap

Ya feel me?

I pledge allegiance to the plug that turned my life
Around
Streets been hot as shit for politics, yeah its going
Down
Today I payed my taxes so I'm feeling like I took a loss
Government want half on that ass yeah, it break â€˜em off
Dear Ghetto America, trying to make the Forbes' list
Label me to democrat, I wanna be republican
I feel like Obama so much pressure on a nigga now
You accidentally shot your home boy, so you're a killer
Now?
Fuck niggas be killing me, two shots to my enemy
Always be your damn self, never be a wanna-be
Coming through traffic back to back like a motorcade
But eythang white instead of black in the motorade
Feeling presidential in a phantom, bitch, I'm JFK

Ronald Reagan campaign, shipping in alota yay

Im Mr Bill Clinton getting head in the Oval room
Dear Ghetto America Yo Gotti for office soon

Dear Ghetto America, land of the thugs
Land of the thugs, land of the drugs
Dear Ghetto America in God we trust and power
Knocking down two tall thick bitches twin towers
Dear Ghetto America
Dear Ghetto America
