[Intro: Yo Gotti]
OG
I’m OG
See the problem, these niggas weren’t raised right
I can’t blame you, I gotta blame your OG
Know what I’m sayin?
Your OG a fuck nigga, what I expect you to be?
I’m OG
You know what I mean?

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
My OG once told me money go hand in hand
My OG once told me bitches go man to man
My OG once told me you gotta feed your fam
My OG once told me you never cross your man
My OG once told me money go hand in hand
My OG once told me bitches go man to man
My OG once told me you gotta feed your fam
My OG once told me you never cross your man

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
My OG told me stay the same
You better not ever change on me
Still the same nigga to this day
And right now got plenty change on me
He told me some people might change on you
But you can’t let that affect you though
Get your money, take care your folks
Turn the bread to some loaves
And if they hating on you, young nigga turn up on ‘em
Make ‘em hate you some more
Make them niggas wanna kill you
(What you gon’ do?) go fuck on they ho
Go buy a whip and another watch
Another chain and another Glock
They don’t want beef, they rappin'
Really wanna be me, why they cappin’?
Don’t rush shit, put your time in it
Hustle hard, put your grind in it
He told me stay loyal to the same niggas
That been fuckin’ with you

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
My OG once told me money go hand in hand
My OG once told me bitches go man to man
My OG once told me you gotta feed your fam
My OG once told me you never cross your man
My OG once told me money go hand in hand
My OG once told me bitches go man to man
My OG once told me you gotta feed your fam
My OG once told me you never cross your man

[Post-Hook: Yo Gotti]
I’m OG (OG), I’m OG (OG)
I’m OG (100), so OG (emoji)
I’m OG (OG), I’m OG (OG)
OG (hundred), emoji

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Told me keep my face clean
Gotta keep my Wraith clean
Gotta keep my safe mean
Hundred racks at eighteen
Shot a nigga at sixteen
Fucked a bitch at thirteen
Fucked ‘round, got that lil ho pregnant
Nigga that was the worst thing
OG told me man up
So I ran them bands up
Told me them niggas gon’ start hating
And they can’t stand us
OG never led me wrong
Shit was gone for too long
OG told me stay strong
You a man, you on your own
[?] apartments
Shady [?] drive, that’ll always be my home
And that’ll always be my throne
Even after all this shit gone

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
My OG once told me money go hand in hand
My OG once told me bitches go man to man
My OG once told me you gotta feed your fam
My OG once told me you never cross your man
My OG once told me money go hand in hand
My OG once told me bitches go man to man
My OG once told me you gotta feed your fam
My OG once told me you never cross your man
