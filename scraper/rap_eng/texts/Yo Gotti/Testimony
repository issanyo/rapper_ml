If I should die before I wake
I pray the streets my work to take
Divide throughout the unfortunate, give my jewelry the most respected
Give my cars to the runners and my guns to the gunners
You know what I'm saying

[Hook:]
Cocaine thoughts
Fishscale visions
Pray the lord forgive a nigga the streets is my religion
Amen amen
Can I hear a hood nigga scream amen
This my testimony my testimony, [x2]

[Verse 1:]
Swear I'm a different type of nigga I'm on that different shit
Err day I wake up I want a different bitch
I don't want the whip plane I want a kit on it
Talking rims so big they can't fit on it
I just bought a different watch and another chain
Fuck around and call my bitch another name
Got a confession to make you all look the same
And I'm so full of that liquor I outta be ashame
They say the rap game changed alot of niggas stressing
But between me and you nigga that's a blessing
Fake niggas come up a real nigga suffer
And record labels fucking niggas that's why I don't trust him
This my testimony I made a true decision
Hope the lord forgive a nigga the streets is my religion
Now can I get a amen
Or can u bless a nigga with a thousand 8 grams

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Remember been in my hood
Playing with that white
Shirt off wide open serve it on sight
100 I shoot 100 I hit 500 I eight nigga
That's my life, y-o g-o-t-t-I don't shit around me but my money get high
If the straps in the room in it ain't a real goon then you can assume that it ain't my guy
15 16 17 5 anything else way to high
Gucci louie that's all I buy
Dope boy pure way to fly
Way to high need to come down
Need to quit playing finna gun yo ass down
You don't know me and I don't know you
You ain't from my hood so don't come around
I'mma tell you like a nigga told
Lil buddy right there might be in o.g.,
With that being said, with that being told
That's the first nigga to front me a whole key
36 O's for the 24 grand
Put it in my hand cause he know I wasn't playing
I was 5 foot 5 with the heart of a lion and the fire in my eyes to kill me a man
Lil ol nigga with a big ol pistol and my pride the only thing I had in this world
Nigga a have to shoot me dead in the face for he run from the hood like a lil ass girl
Strap that pistol some big ass nigga
Talking bout he ain't gone pay me for mine
Every since then I ain't have them problems and the pussy ass niggas started paying on time
This my testimony, my testimony [x2]

[Verse 3:]
I had work inside that kitchen same spot where grandma dishes at
2 doors down that hall to the right were I took them bitches at
Shoe box full of money same spot I kept that chopper at
Open up that closet chop chop chop ain't no stopping that
Cocaine crazy yes I am
Somebody need to pray for me
Lord bless his soul
All that dope I sold I know they got a place for me
Indictment time I'm laying low
Dope boy shit kran flo
Terrence j say it, gone sell a million records that's wat I'm praying fo
You know how this game go
See-saw shit up and down, 9
01 nigga that's my town
And ain't no nigga finna take my crown
North north I ain't project pat

Ion know them guys and they don't know me
So ain't no beef that's that on that

You know what that mean whole lot of white just to go with that green
This that counting that money and a fold machine
When I was 16 I had a 100 grand and this my testimony can I get amen
