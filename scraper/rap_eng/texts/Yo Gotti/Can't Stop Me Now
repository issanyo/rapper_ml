I feel like you can't stop me now, drop me now
Women wanna watch me now, jock me now
I feel like you can't stop me now, they love my voice
Of course, full-force, I done made it now

[Yo Gotti]
I feel like you can't stop me now
I'm tighter now
More of a writer now
Than a rapper now
Got me payin' taxes now
Can't relax now
Got big corporations, sending me faxes now
More than just Yo now
CEO now
You see them diamonds and them ??? in my rope now
I'm on a roll now
Got me doing shows now
And when my album drops, it's certified gold now
Woah now
My pockets on swoll now
Hold now
Uncles Sam askin' how many units I sold now
Thinkin' bout makin' clothes now
Movies and videos now
Puttin it down for big dope boys, make all the noise now
Money come legit now, I put it in the bank now
Withdraw, ATM, from my account now
Check never bounce now
Plat by the once now
So many karats, that it's hard for me to count now

[Hook]

[Yo Gotti]
You ought to see the way I be ballin' now
You ought to see the way the girls be callin' now
Sweatin' me now, talkin' bout get married now
I'm laughin' now, she gettin' about her karats now
It's so funny that it hurt now
She think I'm Captain Kirk now
She ain't spending mine, unless she puttin' in work now
Got me cashin' checks now
Bout time for me to flex now
Bezzled-out Rolex now
Bout to buy a lake now
I refuse to quit now
Cause Gotti is the shit now
Never thought I'd drop a tape and come up wit a hit now
Take it how you wanna now
Don't smoke no marijauna now
That was in my younger days, like youngsters on the corner now
Platted out my grill now
Bout to sign a deal now
Moved into a crib now
Retired from the hill now
Tired of doing dirt now
My niggas on that yirk now
Feel like I owe the Lord, so I'm goin' to church now

[Hook]

[Yo Gotti]
Niggas got they hand out
Like I owe them somethin' now
Constantly askin me for VIP's to my shows now
See me in the street now
Break they neck to speak now
Made a few examples so I barely get beef now
My shit in the stoes (stores) now
Rollin' wit the pros now
Cause my shit is sellin' like the Ralph Lauren clothes now
Clicked up wit Dirt now, people do my track now
Never ever ever will you say my shit is wack now

[Don Dirty]
When you see us banged out in the stretch Lex wit the brains out
Done sold two million or mo' we gettin' change now
Don Dirty left the game on hold, it ain't the same now
Police walkin round in plain clothes, and constantly layin 'round
Police filling phonies with friends,but try to spot me
Set a nigga up for 10 O's and still couldn't stop me
But they watch me
Run in my house just like a hobby
I'm a smooth mastermind in the game
They still can't stop me

[Hook]
