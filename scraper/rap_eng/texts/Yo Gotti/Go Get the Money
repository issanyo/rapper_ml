Ayy, I'm talkin' everything Versace
This shit like Versace dream, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
(Ayy, bruh, bring me one of them things that they put of they head and shit)
These four got Versace soul (I want the gown and all that shit)
Muthafuckin' tea cup, silverware (I'm rockin' them Js though)
I feel rich in this muthafucka', ayy

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I just got back from Dubai ('bai), I'm on these Xans so high (high)

Fuck JFK airport, lost my nigga's grip over Customs (Customs)
Say he had the one in Georgia (what?), he was sippin' on that oil (ayy)
I been out in Abu Dhabi, this shit got me spoiled (spoiled)
They be dressed up head to toe, all they bitches loyal (ayy)

This a Zay track and I talk nothin' but yay on it
This that good music, fuck around and put 'Ye on it
This a Roc track, I fuck around and put Jay on it
Dope boy, I rock designer with my Js on
I'm always rockin' Loubs so I'm always on the red carpet
I don't watch the news, all this gossip none of my dogs started
Get money for a hobby (hobby), my living room a lobby (damn)
And all my niggas shooters, so honestly I don't know who shot him (ugh)
You snitchin' and you rottin', I see these little rappers teamin' up

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Maybach Music
Go get the money machine, Zay, go get the money machine, Zay

[Verse 2: T.I.]
How much you think they would pay for your life?
In the trap with the weed and the yay and the dice
Do it big for my niggas doin’ bids in the struggle
Free Kaep, Meek, middle finger to them suckas
We don't hear them motherfuckas, we get rid of motherfuckas
I’m a big dog, bark, you a little motherfucka
Okay get your bitch get dicked down right
After she get ate like knife in her (uh-huh)
Have her screamin’ THUG LIFE in her
Her face look better with my pipe in it
On Percocets and Vicodin, good weed and mushrooms
You see the drink is all in the kitchen
And the white girls in and out the dressing room
I finna fuck that shit, is you in or not?
There’s a bag full of money, we’ll be in and out
From what I heard you asked me if I wanna get shot
Shoot somebody else do a bid or not

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
AMG the fo, carbon fiber, niggas peelin’ out
Push button, roof is changin’ colors, fuck the ceilin’ now
Cookin’ powder in a crockpot ‘til it’s spillin’ out
Million dollar marchin’ dope boys, bring my children out
Feel ‘em out, you the plug, spit ‘em out, you the hub
Send ‘em out, Palm Island, rent a house, fly her in
Rent her mouth, center stage, spendin’ now, send her back
Sweat it out, with a bag, breaded out, yeah!
I would rather sell dope forever niggas (ever niggas)
Take my chances instead of rappin' with you peasant niggas (peasant niggas)
Underwater bring it back like it’s a treasure nigga (treasure nigga)
King Push and Zaytoven, it’s whatever niggas, yuugh!

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Go get the money machine, Zay, go get the money machine, Zay
Go get the money machine, Zay, plug in the money machine, Zay
Plug in the money money machine, yay, I need the money machine, yay
We need the money machine, yay, go get the money machine, huh
Go get the money machine, huh, go get the money machine, huh
Plug in the money machine, huh, I need the money machine, Zay
We need the money money machine, zay, we need the money machine, Zay
We need the money machine, Zay, go get the money machine, Zay
