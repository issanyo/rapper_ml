[Verse 3: Yazz]
Now she gon' do a dance for me
She gon' make that booty clap like some hands for me
Told her, "I don't wait in line, girl, these foreign shoes"
Walk up in the club, wavy, let 'em all choose
Just messed up some commas, just messed up some Euros
I'm talking you and me, shawty, that's plural
You can not name a young realer, I'm uno
Getting wasted tonight like no tomorrow
I'm up in the VIP, run the whole section
All these haters talk, but it don't effect me
I ain't lifting weights but you know I'm flexin'
So you gon' get a dance cause tonight I'm checkin'

[Chorus 2: Serayah + Yazz]
Pull up to the club with the doors up
We don't wait in line, you know who we are
Popping all the bottles, yes, all night

I'mma do this dance on you all night
She gon' do a dance on me all night
I'mma do this dance on you all night
She gon' do a dance on me all night
She gon' do a dance on me all night
All night she gon' do a dance for me
All night, all night

Bounce that ass let me see you move, do it
Bounce that ass let me see you move (Oh, baby)

[Chorus 2: Serayah + Yazz]
Pull up to the club with the doors up

Popping all the bottles, yes, all night

She gon' do a dance on me all night
She gon' do a dance on me all night

All night she gon' do a dance for me
All night, all night
