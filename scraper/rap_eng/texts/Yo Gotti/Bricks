[Intro: Wale]
From a brick to a stone, does a fiend have a soul?
Does a kid need a goal if powder's made of gold?

[Bridge: Wale]
Getting blowed
Thinkin I'm so glad that I can rap cause I can't move no dope
But I do know, a few niggas that did and a few niggas that still
And a few niggas that's through, are the few niggas that's dead..

[Verse 1: Wale]
So fuck a 9 to 5, they clockin and tryna to survive
Cop a brick and supply cause nobody offering jobs
Bricks build buildings, build houses, build neighborhoods
But a brick done turned a nigga to a baller or a dated shirt
Understated to say it hurts, I was optimistic
Till I seen my youngin' whippin' made me wish that I was flippin'
Fuck this college when niggas out it's just dollar pitchin'
Cause after 4 or 5 you don't got nothing but college tickets
Bricks

[Hook: Lyfe Jennings & Wale]
But them niggas tryna hold my head and work this out
Counting numbers up in my head tryna build this house
Mama told me if I make my bed then I gotta lay down
But I never seem to keep these words all up out my mouth
Bricks, it's all them niggas talkin bout
Bricks, it's all them niggas talkin bout
Bricks, it's all them niggas thinkin bout
Little niggas on the scene, ain't gotta dream it now

[Bridge: Wale]
Studio getting blowed
Thinkin I'm so glad that I can rap cause I can't move no dope
But I do know, a few niggas that did and a few niggas that still
And a few niggas that's through, are the few niggas that's dead..

[Verse 2: Wale]
Look, little niggas'll shoot you, they got nothing to say
Cause local celebrities only bout a brick away
Niggas used to whip em he getting those from whippin yay
And you got no paper, you been so patient, come get some weight
Sneaker boxes, you can see your progress
And you weekend shopping, show people your people poppin
I can see the problem, you nigga don't lack no conscience
Can't shoot, can't dribble, can't rap, young nigga don’t got no options
From a brick, to a stone, turned a fiend, from a homie
When the powder, turn to power, and the power turn to dough
Turning head with yo whip, is it worth what you did?
If a brick is a brick through a brick you can build
From a brick to a stone, make a fiend for a homie
Turn a cheek on a foe, turn a reef to a home
Turn the powder, into power, and the power turn to hoes
If a brick is a brick, through a brick you can grow

[Interlude]
Bricks (ohh, ohh ohh ohh)
Bricks, (ohh, ohh ohh ohh)
Bricks, (ohh, ohh ohh ohh)
Bricks (ohh, ohh ohh ohh)
It's only one way out

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Nine years old, Feds looking for my moms
10 or 11, held my first gun
First time I heard bricks, I was thinking construction
Until my 'migo plug from Mexicó gave me my introduction
Now 16, getting them bricks for the 16
Was unwrapping bricks but now I'm rappin' bricks for 16
I was 17 ridin' in that Lexus on 20's
18 and 19 payin' nothing over 20
And a thousand 8 grams divided by 4 is 2-52
If you know what that mean you noticed it now and if you don't, learn how to divide nigga
I'm talkin' bricks, no jump shots
I’m talking work, no punch clock!
I'm Yo Gotti! I Am! Chea

[Hook: Lyfe Jennings & Wale]
But them niggas tryna hold my head and work this out
Counting numbers up in my head tryna build this house
Mama told me if I make my bed then I gotta lay down
But I never seem to keep these words all up out my mouth
Bricks, it's all them niggas talkin bout
Bricks, it's all them niggas talkin bout
Bricks, it's all them niggas thinkin bout
Little niggas on the scene, ain't gotta dream it now

[Outro]
From a brick to a stone from the stone to the shone
If it shone in the hood, then you know that you good
From the powder to the crack from the crack to the slums
Dealers in the back to the clappers in the front
