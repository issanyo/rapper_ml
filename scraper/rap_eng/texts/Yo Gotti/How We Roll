[Intro: Sam Sneak]
It's how we roll

[Chorus: Sam Sneak]
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Young niggas is in control
Real niggas will never fold
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Young niggas is in control
Real niggas will never fold

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah! We in control nigga!
Everytime I pull up, bitches they be like what up
Pull up I put the top down, pull off I put the hood up
Everything that I got now I got it because I stood up
Ya'll suckas was not round and made the way I was brought up
Cause I was always taught to just never fold
I bought another Rolls
I started from selling O's, now my bank account seven O's
And there's two commas on it
Riding, two llamas on it
This purp like my pancakes, I put Aunt Jemima on it
And I'm getting higher nigga, riding with Gotti nigga
Two Phantoms, an Aston Martin, boy that's a Bugatti nigga
In back of the Fisker, and I ain't mention the Rarri' nigga
Bitches like 'Bari nigga, oh
Boats and hoes, money, cars, and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Soon as we hit the party it's choices on all these hoes
We fucking all of they bitches, you niggas is getting old

[Chorus: Sam Sneak]
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Young niggas is in control
Real niggas will never fold
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Young niggas is in control
Real niggas will never fold

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I'm standing on the couch like fuck life
Pussy nigga playing games he can die tonight
And we just pulled up in a million dollar worth of cars
Million problems, thousand guns, just a couple dogs
Just a couple real niggas I can ride for
Black man's black 40 cal, black Tahoe
Black driver, white Rolls Royce, real nigga, I'm the ho's choice
Conversations with Meek about shit we did in the streets
How we fucked with our dogs, how we planning to eat
Bricked the rapper on the beat, hundred k in a week
Its CMG, MMG, everybody else enemy
Fuck boats and hoes, Cuban links in gold
The game done got cold, I know real niggas who told
Since that the role that they chose (fuck em!)
Send them hittas up to their door (murder)

[Chorus: Sam Sneak]
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Young niggas is in control
Real niggas will never fold
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Young niggas is in control
Real niggas will never fold

[Verse 3: Betrayl]
I ain't dead but I'm the president
Money green, dutch for the medicine
Bogota going through the Mexicans
Switch it up, up to the nose it's heroin
An epidemic, Fall River walking dead again
The city on fire, we let it burn
Smoke got the BM-Dubb moving like a hovercraft
Off the highway and she trafficking Marilyn Monroe
Front door she passing it (let me get that)
Cause most times the corners are a gold mine
Out the hood now we shooting for the coast line
Boats and hoes, below deck with them bricks nigga
Cause you can keep that other shit with ya

[Outro: Betrayl]
Ace Diamond
We back nigga
Fucking with that other shit
It's New B
