Yo know a lot of niggas dream about a lot of shit
Know what I'm sayin
Most of dat shit be out of reach
Like niggas be dreamin about bitches and having wet dreams an shit
Nigga I be hearing money machines in my dreams nigga
I dream about millions kno what im talkin bout
I dream about freedom(Yo gizzle)
I used to have nighmares
Wakin up in the kitchen shakin up
Baking soda over my hands
Could you imagine
Pitch black dark room
Cold hearted full goon
Down on his knees just prayin
And shit I was a teenage
No mutant no ninjin turtle
400 yd dash
Bitch im jumpin hurdles
Call me mister 800
That's a O of the purple
I'm just tryin to get money break bread wit my circle
I sleep wit my eyes open(so high)
But I ain't smoking
See errythang (but I ain't locin)
I'm focused like a small car foreign
Niggas think that i'm noid
I got a chance and I'd be damn if I blow it(yeah)
See a old head told me back in 89
A sleeper gets nothin but a dream
But den came a wise man told me in 1997
You only gone be good as ya team
Number one rule everybody must have loyalty
Team need a team shit to strive of royalties
