[Intro: Yo Gotti & Gucci Mane]
Chea! (Yeah)
Ay, you know I'm lookin' for a five-star bitch, talkin' bout
(Burr! Burr!) I'm talkin' homegirl
Be lookin' like she just stepped outta magazine (Gucci!)
If your credit score high, feet and nails stay fly
Keep your juice box wet, and your head somethin' fine
This time, it's gonna be somethin' serious (yeah!)
I want a five-star bitch, I need a five-star bitch
I need a five-star bitch, I want a five-star bitch

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gotti, here go twelve bars, Gucci Mane got nine cars
We don't call 'em dimes no more, '09 we call 'em five stars
I'm a five-star nigga, this a five-star clique
That's a 645, this that new M6
Pay her bills, get her hair fixed, might even pay her rent
And the way she give it to me, best money I ever spent
Hey, I can't even lie, I'm so super high
Do not need her, will not keep her unless she is fly
Gucci Mane's a thug, B; your man is a scrub, see
She loves me now, she loves you not, yeah all my bitches love me
And if you in Atlanta, look up Gucci girl and beep me
And we can find a five-star hotel, you can meet me

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
That's a five-star bitch, that's a five-star bitch
Now that's a five-star bitch, now that's a five-star bitch
If your credit score high, feet and nails stay fly
Keep your juice-box wet and your head somethin' fine
Then you a five-star bitch, ay you a five-star bitch
Ay you a five-star bitch, ay you a five-star bitch
I want a five-star chick, I need a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick, I want a five-star chick

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
It's your boy Yo Gotti, I do grade A shit
I'm the realest nigga walkin', and this the remix
And still I'm out here lookin' for a five-star chick
When I catch her, I'mma bless her with a five-star kid
She a natural born hustla, she ain't chasin' no suckas
On a mission for a real nigga, she ain't never fucked a busta
So your cars and your jewelry that she really don't excite
And all them hatin'-ass hoes in the club want to fight
She was born in the A, went to school in D.C
Got a job in Dallas, Texas then moved to Tennessee
If you ain't a five-star, need to go ahead and face it
Fake Gucci, fake Louis, shorty that'll make you basic
That ain't a five-star bitch, that ain't a five-star bitch
That ain't a five-star bitch, girl ain't a five-star bitch

[Verse 3: Trina]
(Trina!) See I'm a five-star bitch cause I ain't that other bitch
She been strugglin' for hers, from the womb, I been rich
I ain't gotta talk about the money and the shoe game
All you gotta do is Google Trina, see the proof, mane
Cause ain't none of these hoes doing shows in a recession
They cards get declined, now they suffering a depression
While I'm spending meals, signin' all kinda deals
I'm a five-star bitch eatin' five-star meals
My whole lifestyle like "Coming to America"
All my Louis luggage, you see my bag how I carry her
Walkin' through the airport like I'm in a parade
On my hologram, loggin' on to E-Trade

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
That's a five-star bitch, that's a five-star bitch
Now that's a five-star bitch, now that's a five-star bitch
If your credit score high, feet and nails stay fly
Keep your juice-box wet and your head somethin' fine
Then you a five-star bitch, ay you a five-star bitch
Ay you a five-star bitch, ay you a five-star bitch
I want a five-star chick, I need a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick, I want a five-star chick

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
I just had a epiphany, I need to go to Tiffany's
Fendi on my slippers and my cookies always slippery
I don't need help, I pay the bills on time
So I be yellin' "Fuck 'em" with a dildo sign
Five, little mama, you a three-star
I ain't sleepin' when I say I'm in my dream car
Oh, did I stutter? Harajuku hyphen
Barbie, I'm hot, I think it's time to put the rice in
I was in the chair, I was gluin' my weave in
When you hit the stage, they was booin' and leavin'
Young Money, red flag, no more auditions
Ask Lil' Wayne who the five-star bitch is!

[Outro: Yo Gotti]
That's a five-star bitch, that's a five-star bitch
Now that's a five-star bitch, now that's a five-star bitch
