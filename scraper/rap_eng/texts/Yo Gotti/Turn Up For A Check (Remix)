I'ma tell you, I got some shit to tell you...

Let me tell you what a nigga told me
Expect nothing don't nobody owe me
Grindin for the check I hustle like Ginobli
So if you talking money you gon' have to show me
I'ma turn up for a check
I'ma pull up in that Vette
Make these bitches break they necks
Y'all gon' gimme my respect
I'ma turn up for a check
I'ma pull up in that Vette
Make these bitches break they necks
Y'all gon' gimme my respect

Ya'll gon' give it to me I'ma take it
Keep the main bitch naked
Early morning just finish fucking
Im waking up to that bacon
I've been here no mistaking
Talking money situations
Building shit from the ground up
And now I made my mark, quotations
My enemy I'ma taste a dream
Gotta put a hater on chill
Since seventeen they been tryna scheme
Boy I Am Legend like Will
Hustle hard but made the team
But instead they testing my skills
May I know I'm too cold
I give these bitches the chills
Everybody wanna know the scoop on me
But you know I stay low-key
If I ain't somewhere chasing that check
I'm somewhere getting good head from a freak
Got these niggas upset cause i kick
It one hundred, I'm a fool on the beat
I ain't really worried bout Next cause
A nigga got Now... Hold on let me preach

Let me tell you what a nigga told me
Expect nothing don't nobody owe me
Grindin for the check I hustle like Ginobli
So if you talking money you gon' have to show me
I'ma turn up for a check
I'ma pull up in that Vette
Make these bitches break they necks
Y'all gon' gimme my respect
I'ma turn up for a check
I'ma pull up in that Vette
Make these bitches break they necks
Y'all gon' gimme my respect

I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
Fucked up the last nigga who owed me
I'ma turn up bout a check
I'ma put off for my set
Couple karats on my neck
Prolly ain't paying for my respect
I doubt they gave a shit they in the streets feel me
I'm fucked up bout my hater
Boy they wanna kill me
Now pull up in they Vette
Know that there 20-14
Now set off for Viato
Vanilla ice cream
Rich surfin in the kitchen
I should join the swim team
So close to 10 mill tryna get to 15
BCMG the Mob all my niggas got hard
It's a motherfuckin massacre if I ever get robbed
Let me tell 'em

Let me tell you what a nigga told me
Expect nothing don't nobody owe me
Grindin for the check I hustle like Ginobli
So if you talking money you gon' have to show me
