[Chorus: Yo Gotti]

I know you ain't hating on yo dog were they do that at niggas going insane about a braud were they do that at
Snitching ass working for the laws were they do that at... aye were they do that at

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I'm sitting up o's of that purple shit nigga playing money games
Charged a nigga a couple hundreds he told me charge it to the game
Oka it's all good bet I get his ass next time around ordered up the whole pound let my youngins lay him down
North memphis number 1 rule bitch nobody slide playing with me money just like playing with a nigga pride
And if you ever ever ever ever hurt a nigga feelings it's gone be a bloody bloody murder cold hearted killing
You ain't got no witness then they ain't got no damn case million dollar bond bitch that really like a hundred days
That real hood shit nothing but facts when I'm talking certified street approval and I'm the realiest nigga walking

Niggas pistol playing showing straps where they do that at
How you ain't got no work but in the trap where they do that at
Aye where they do that at [x4]

Niggas going insane about a braud were they do that at
Snitching ass working for the laws were they do that at

Niggas going insane about a braud were they do that at
Snitching ass working for the laws were they do that at
