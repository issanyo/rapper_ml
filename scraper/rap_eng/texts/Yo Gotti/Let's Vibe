Shawty ride or die here for sober or high
She kno jus wat to do to help a gangsta get by
Shawty know a I like head...she ain't trippin at all
She go down on a nigga and she a swallow it all
Me and her done it all, catch us both at the mall
She can get wat she wanna and it ain't trickin at all
Shawty fukk wit her nigga her nigga fukk wit her bakk
She put her life on the line cuz she a ride wit this sack
Wen i went bakk to the hood hustlin movin them birds
She was takin up nurses studying gettin wats hers
I ain't chase her or sweat her try my best to protect her
Wen you fukk wit a gangsta baby you bet imma bless ya
And thats real

If you wanna come ride then (lets ride)
If you wanna come smoke then (lets smoke)
If you wanna come drink then (lets drink)
If you wanna come vibe then (lets vibe) Come vibe *baby*
I been thinkin bout fuckin you
I been thinkin bout kissin you
And touchin and lovin you (thats all i wanna do baby)

Wen we out on the road granted doin ma shows
She be callin my phone like dont be fuckin them hoes
She at home wit my child i be flirtin in the crowd
I need help i can't control myself these hoes be wild
As I think to myself another nigga in my bed
So i start thinkin it off that shit a fukk up yo head
My confedearal Jesus i work so hard for the bread
Wonder if she a keep it real if i eva go to the feds
She gon write me and visit me like i think that she should
Or she gon disrespect me fukk another nigga out the hood
I ain't chase her or sweat her try my best to protect her
I dont kno about love i jus kno jus kno wat imma get ya

If you wanna come ride then (lets ride)
If you wanna come smoke then (lets smoke)
If you wanna come drink then (lets drink)
If you wanna come vibe then (lets vibe) Come vibe *baby*
I been thinkin bout fuckin you
I been thinkin bout kissin you
And touchin and lovin you (thats all i wanna do baby)

When yo momma was trippin talkin bout kickin you out
You had nowhere to go i let you move in my house
You can jump in my benz, go stunt out on ya friends
I took you all around the world and I a do it again
You respected my grind cuz you knew I had dat work
And I respected ya mind because you still went to work
See it wasn't bout the money shawty kept it *one hundred*
She stayed in tune wit her family because they knew I was hustlin

If you wanna come ride then (lets ride)
If you wanna come smoke then (lets smoke)
If you wanna come drink then (lets drink)
If you wanna come vibe then (lets vibe) Come vibe baby
I been thinkin bout fuckin you
I been thinkin bout kissin you
And touchin and lovin you (thats all i wanna do baby)
