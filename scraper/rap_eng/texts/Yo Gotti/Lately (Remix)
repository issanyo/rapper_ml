[Intro: MoneyBagg Yo]
Lately, lately
Ugh, yeah, ugh
Federal flow

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
Just had a fallout with my nigga so it's been fuck him lately
Tryna make everybody happy, shit gonna run me crazy
I'm still prepared for the worst, keep a strap on me daily
It's just me against the world, how a nigga been feeling lately
Lately, I ain't been lettin' nothin' faze me
Lately, I been countin' money on the daily
Lately, I been fuckin' bitches that ain't basic
Lately, I been servin' patients, ducking cases

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
As soon as I walk in, don't do the talkin'
I'm knowin' she gon' be ready
I'm livin' the thug life
Scarf tatted around my head like 2Pac Makiavelli
My pockets on fat, I'm playin' with them racks
So I'm feelin' extra heavy
I'm surrounded in ice, plus I got the stick on me
You can call me Wayne Gretzky
Lately, lately, I been drippin' that sauce like gravy
Quarter mil on me, two eighty
Ain't a thing on me fugazi, yeah
Lately, lately, ain't gon' lie, man shit been crazy
Broke the news to my bitch, I just had another baby yeah

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
Just had a fallout with my nigga so it's been fuck him lately
Tryna make everybody happy, shit gonna run me crazy
I'm still prepared for the worst, keep a strap on me daily
It's just me against the world, how a nigga been feeling lately
Lately, I ain't been lettin' nothin' faze me
Lately, I been countin' money on the daily
Lately, I been fuckin' bitches that ain't basic
Lately, I been servin' patients, ducking cases

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Look, lately I have had the strangest feelings, word to Jodeci
Lately I been lowkey but my jewelry make you notice me
Lately I'm a movie everybody wanna go to see
Lately I go foreign, everything I got from overseas
Stop runnin' 'round sayin' that you used to date me
Like Janet say, what have you done for me lately?
Show them niggas love then they turn around and hate me
But can't break me, 'cause they ain't make me
I give them niggas what they ask for
They ain't even gotta say please
Got gorillas that'll wash you
I be where them bathing apes be
Got a bad bitch, she shapely
Fuck me like she tryna rape me
My wrist cold like Minnesota, she comin' through with that AP
Run it up

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
Just had a fallout with my nigga so it's been fuck him lately
Tryna make everybody happy, shit gonna run me crazy
I'm still prepared for the worst, keep a strap on me daily
It's just me against the world, how a nigga been feeling lately
Lately, I ain't been lettin' nothin' faze me
Lately, I been countin' money on the daily
Lately, I been fuckin' bitches that ain't basic
Lately, I been servin' patients, ducking cases

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Lately I been gettin' to the money on these niggas
I been so one hundred on these niggas
I ain't gotta try to do it, I done did it on these niggas
Yeah, ugh, shitted on these niggas
Case dismissed, acquitted on these niggas
Yeah, truck, Bentley on these niggas
Yeah, go hard, I'm from Memphis
I ain't never put faith in these hoes, had feelings on these niggas
Homeboy with the shit so it's been fuck him lately
Homegirl super thick, fuck around have my baby
Watch queen of the south, wishing that was my lady
CMG the new Cash Money, I guess I'm Baby
Lately, I been feelin' super antisocial
Been paranoid, don't you speak to me if I don't know you
Baby, ain't paying for no pussy, I don't owe you
Extort me, that will never happen, I done told you
I ain't fuckin' with you right now

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
Just had a fallout with my nigga so it's been fuck him lately
Tryna make everybody happy, shit gonna run me crazy
I'm still prepared for the worst, keep a strap on me daily
It's just me against the world, how a nigga been feeling lately
Lately, I ain't been lettin' nothin' faze me
Lately, I been countin' money on the daily
Lately, I been fuckin' bitches that ain't basic
Lately, I been servin' patients, ducking cases, lately
