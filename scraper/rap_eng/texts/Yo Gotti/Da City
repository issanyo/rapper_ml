[Hook: Yo Gotti]
I come from a city where niggas will hate you for anything
I come from a city where niggas will kill you ‘bout anything
I come from a city where niggas be tellin’ ‘bout anything
I come from a city, your enemies they be your niggas man
I come from a city where bitches will fuck you for anything
Niggas be talkin’ ‘bout plugs but really the middle man
I come from the kitchen, put on for my city, I did it man
These chances I’m taking ain’t worth it but I gotta get it man

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
My love to the hood
Thanks for making me savage
Thanks to my mama and daddy for raising me like a lil gangster
And giving me that banger when I was too young to have it
Yeah, I was too young to have it
Five bricks, I was too young to manage
Thank god mom was so dumb and gambling
Feds came, watching my pops and them vanish
I want to say thank you but I hate you
I talk to the dope like why they make you?
Mama told me they gon’ come and take you
But don’t let them people ever break you
And no thank you, I’m famous
No thank you, I’m good
No thank you, know your intentions
I’m with my same crew and we see straight through you
I’m with my same bitch, I been with her since high school
They say when you get big watch your city turn they back on you
They so fake, drop a hit and watch how quick they get back on you
Shit crazy for real

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
I come from a city where niggas will hate you for anything
I come from a city where niggas will kill you ‘bout anything
I come from a city where niggas be tellin’ ‘bout anything
I come from a city, your enemies they be your niggas man
I come from a city where bitches will fuck you for anything
Niggas be talkin’ ‘bout plugs but really the middle man
I come from the kitchen, put on for my city, I did it man
These chances I’m taking ain’t worth it but I gotta get it man

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
Niggas’ll see a nigga who done robbed and shot at ‘em, and won’t do shit
But don’t let ‘em hear you fucking these hoes though
He gon’ kill you ‘bout that bitch
Ayy where I come from they don’t like to see you winning
Shining on top of your bid
They say you didn’t do it but really you did
This shit so crazy, they respect the snitches
Yeah, streets ain’t got no love for a nigga
I been told you that
If you in my city, where you at
You gotta have you a strap
Cause they robbing over nothing
Killing ‘cause they struggling
I swear it’s a real jungle
A lot of tears from mamas
When it’s gon’ stop, sometimes I just wonder
You’ll see him one day, then he dead the next night
Bitches mean enough to fight and beef on social sites
From the trenches where a nigga come from
Came up, never gave up
Lost love, got so many
Guess I’m just a product of my city

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
I come from a city where niggas will hate you for anything
I come from a city where niggas will kill you ‘bout anything
I come from a city where niggas be tellin’ ‘bout anything
I come from a city, your enemies they be your niggas man

These chances I’m taking ain’t worth it but I gotta get it man
