Got the trap house jumpin' like Kobe
Cashed out, hundred K on a Rollie
You ain't one of me, nigga, don't talk to me, nigga
I'm a real ass nigga, you phony
In the kitchen whippin' up them babies
Make the Pyrex trap go crazy
Young nigga got money, young nigga got work
Young nigga got crack like the 80s
I'm winnin', I'm winnin', I'm dunkin', I'm dunkin'
I'm Jordan, you're not even Kobe
In the kitchen with a Pyrex pot
Where the whippin' in the pot too hot
Drinkin' lean, out the bottle
In the Aston Martin foreign with a model
Twenty racks on me, got tats on me
In the bed with six hoes like two times three

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Trap house jumping like Jordan

Row so hot I won’t buy, break 33 like Bird
Fell out with my Js, I’m a true champ like Wade
I’m a true champ like LeBron
I don’t got war without a gun
Got molly, got kush, I got pills, I got keys
And I feel like I’m running the town
My tide go up and down
My wrist go round and round
I fuck with plugs, no sockets
I look for them drugs, narcotics
The money ain’t right, them grams ain’t either
So nigga you just need to stop it
