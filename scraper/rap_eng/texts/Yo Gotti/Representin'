Man I be putting on for my niggas off in them streets
All my people up in that jailhouse, waiting up on that bail out
Dope boys tryna get up off of them keys
Man it don’t get no better than this

And we on, and we on, if we ain’t, we bout to be on
I’m flexing bitch and I’m representing my city
And we on, and we on, if we ain’t, we bout to be on

850, that’s where I came from
Got all my niggas with me, bitch niggas it ain’t none
Were you think I’m getting my name from, somewhere you can’t come
Got kids off in that chain gang, bang bang, bum bum
That’s right, RIP to all of my street soldiers
Imma hold it down for you, Imma take these streets over, alright
I don’t know what I would do without this shit
Posted up on that corner, chuck that L up and I’m out this bitch
Like all the way to Miami, ridin’ to Lauderdale
Got that Florida State of mind, I might as well
Push that pedal down in that Chevrolet, hold it down for my whole state
Real niggas salute this shit, fuck niggas gonna hate me when I’m

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I'ma pull up in a Phantom, doors in reverse
Hundred on the chain, couple hundred for the joints
Whole squad getting money, young nigga in a Porsche
Being real a way of life but blowing money, that’s a sport
Young nigga go and trap, we show up in court
Fuck the judge, lawyer pay, nigga we here for support
I’m from North Memphis, Watkins and Brown, same court
And I be in that kitchen with a pot and a fork
All my niggas my niggas, I don’t fuck around with no pussies
Get money, we break bread, I ain’t falling out bout pussy
Go hard for the neighborhood, and I put on for my city
Been to 50 states and 100 hoods and I’m still the king of Memphis

[Verse 3 – Snootie Wild]
[?] what’s up, fuck you think my thumbs up
Nigga try to runs up, he better have his guns up
Four years in that jail cell, four years and it was hell
Only thing I wish I can do, bring em all here
But I can’t save everybody, everybody want saving
Whole thing and I’m saving, here’s my kids, safe day
Hey, hey, what they want me to do
Hey, cause I don’t have a clue
Memphis Tenn what made me, Memphis drove me crazy
First 48, got my niggas taken
First deal on the plate, fuck it, Imma take it
You know the streets raised me, thought I wasn’t gone make it, hey
