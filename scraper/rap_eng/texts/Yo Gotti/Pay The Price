[Verse 1:]
Yeah
Bills due on the kitchen table
Mama walked past em cause she ain't able
Watching mama's family sister tryna watch cartoons muthafucka came through and clipped the cable
Get a job that's the usual
Mama had a job that ain't do enough
Mama hired me I'm sacking groceries up
90 days later I was posting up
Quarter pound of weed 250 strong
Staying out late bringing profit home
It's me and Big G tryna stack it up
Shit ain't been the same since my nigga gone
I looked up to niggas like Hookshot
Niggas like Lil Pat and Woo Woo
I was on the block as a young boy
Watching them hustle it was like school

[Chorus:]
I hustled with the greats, ate with the vultures and the snakes
My days turned to nights my nights turned to days
Streets got me paid
And I know Ima pay the price for it
I know it
One day Ima pay the price for it
I know it
I know it
I know it

[Verse 2:]
First time I seen 10 bands
First time I seen 100 grand
First time I seen 1 mill
I knew shit was about to get real
Homeboys start acting different
Shit changed I ain't even tripping
Same nigga used to ride for em one time I was on the front line for em
I was a hitta for a dopeboy
Play crazy yeah you know boy
Im in the hood with the doors up
Nigga I ain't never froze up
Bad bitches chose up
They like me or the lifestyle
Nigga I don't really give a fuck
But Ima burn the head in a meanwhile

[Chorus:]
I hustled with the greats, ate with the vultures and the snakes
My days turned to nights my nights turned to days
Streets got me paid
And I know Ima pay the price for it
I know it
One day Ima pay the price for it
I know it
I know it
I know it

[Verse 3:]
Shit different you ain't even notice it
All the hustlers I ain't even quote it
New Wraith I ain't even rode it
Nick got a strap he ain't even load it
Shit real growing up in the projects
Tryna stay real in the process
Seen a pump knock out a nigga intestines
Young boy standing there tryna digest it
Where all the real niggas at that's my question
Never got indicted that's my blessing
When I put it on the Gram that's the motivate you
Inspiration nigga that's not flexing
New Lambs, new Raris
Little homie fighting charges
Make bond get em lawyers
Green dot so they can call you

[Chorus:]
I hustled with the greats, ate with the vultures and the snakes
My days turned to nights my nights turned to days
Streets got me paid
And I know Ima pay the price for it
I know it
One day Ima pay the price for it
I know it
I know it
I know it
