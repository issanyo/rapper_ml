[Intro]
I've been standing in the kitchen over there
Stove just wanna whip it
Mixing yellow with the soda
Cook the whole thing got half a brick over

[Chorus]
I'm on that cocaine 6
They not give him no
With them cocaine hits
I'm on my dope boy shit
I'm on that cocaine shit
White bit, white out for
For white bitch
I think I'm on that cocaine shit
Cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine
Cocaine is all they wanna hear
Cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine
Cocaine that what they know me for

[Verse 1]
Ok, first thing first
Pussy jump me in
I'm fresh up off the row
Made Manichee that weekend
Violate our management
Fresh up out a meeting
Chris Lighty told me stick to the streets
He got that business
I'm like who you getting?
Trying to make these millions
To the maserati I cop that for Easter weekend
Got to fill ourselves
But I can't find a ceiling
These little bone niggas mostly rim your bitches in here chilling
He's going up and down
Her neck looks like a yo-yo
She said she wants him in too
I told her that's a no-no
Be my baby mama
Need her, you my main hoe
Pussy ass rappers we ain't cool
And you know so
Plus I need a halo
Pisses me the H-off
Streets is my religion
I be bringing to my four-four
Gotti where you been?
Hanging at the bank, bitch
All around the globe
Ripping that cocaine shit

[Chorus]
I'm on that cocaine 6
They not give him no
With them cocaine hits
I'm on my dope boy shit
I'm on that cocaine shit
White bit, white out for
For white bitch
I think I'm on that cocaine shit
Cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine
Cocaine is all they wanna hear
Cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine
Cocaine that what they know me for

[Verse 2]
Eyes froze
These niggas tell you they business
Niggas talk like they gangsters
But most of these niggas bitches
Your favorite rapper
Probably ain't got no riches
Probably still on the jewel
And most of the cars rented
Mainly this industry shit
Made for T.V
Watered down commercial line
Niggas don't want to see me
Besides, this shit
Faker than wrestling
God is selling out to a label
You couldn't imagine
Fuck them with their fancies
Their labels and their advancements
'Cause I got plugs on plugs that send me
Bricks on bricks in advancements
Now fuck them all, bam
Trying to get my ass in
I'm the gangster of the year
And that's how I been
Ever since I entered
Seen me in a rental
One thing right about it nigga
There's some bricks inside the fender
Prep the cans
You step in the middle
Smell like gasoline
Fish gill, white glitter

[Chorus]
I'm on that cocaine 6
They not give him no
With them cocaine hits
I'm on my dope boy shit
I'm on that cocaine shit
White bit, white out for
For white bitch
I think I'm on that cocaine shit
Cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine
Cocaine is all they wanna hear
Cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine
Cocaine that what they know me for
