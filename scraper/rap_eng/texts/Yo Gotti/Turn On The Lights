Turn on the lights, I’m looking for her
Girl of my dreams, I’m just looking for her
I’m looking for, running ‘round the streets, I’m looking for her
They say she is stripper, she don’t suppose to be your be your girl
But if I really like her dog, ‘ who cares what she was?
I think it don’t matter, she the girl of my dreams
She a bad bitch and I just want her on my team
Cut on the lights, I’m looking for her
Met her in the club & I’m looking for her
Cut off the lights

If you wanna live the rich, you got to see the picture
You can’t get dollars forever, girl, you got to fuck a real nigga
Hope you see the shit that I see in my eyes when I see ‘em
Hope you think the shit that I think in my mind and be in em

Turn on the lights, I’m looking for her
I heard that pussy good and they tricking for
I heard she got a plan, she’s just dancin on the side
And when she get her money right she puttin it to the side

Turn on the lights, I’m looking for her, I’m looking for her
I’m looking for her, turn on the lights
I’m looking for her, I’m looking for her

Say I love my baby momma, she dont never give me drama
In my phone I found her number, I will fuck her number one
Say I’m sorry for this shit I put you through
But I’m a street nigga, what the fuck I’m suppose to do?
And when I bought that Dolce I went and bought you one too
So you can kill them bitches every time you pull up to
Turn on the lights, that club packed, that bitch is bad
And I see some red way in the back, back

She say she a fan, and if she fuck me, she a groupie
I say no you’re not, girl, that shit sound stupid
Turn on the lights, I’m looking for her
A million miles away, I send a ticket for her
Sex on the beach, Miami full
The way she make that noise I’ve got a Grammy for her
Say she a down bitch, a hold me down bitch
Super fly chick, a ride or die bitch
And I just wanna say I’m happy that you are my bitch
I’ll never be ashamed, so you can quit that shy shit

And turn on the lights, I’m looking for her
I heard that pussy good and they’re tipping for it
I heard she got a plan, she’s a dancer on the side
And when she get her money right she puttin it to the side
Turn on the lights, I’m looking for her, I’m looking for her
I’m looking for her
Turn on the lights, I’m looking for her, I’m looking for her
I’m looking for her
