[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
In my section
You see sparklers in my section, you see models in my section
You see goons, nigga try us make the news
That’s how we move, that’s how we move
Don’t go in the club without them tools
Can’t rock that set without them jewels
Don’t chase them hoes, we let ‘em choose

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
In my section
You see sparklers in my section, you see models in my section
You see goons, nigga try us make the news
That’s how we move, that’s how we move
Don’t go in the club without them tools
Can’t rock that set without them jewels
Don’t chase them hoes, we let ‘em choose

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I grew up in Section 8, but now I’m rich, they wanna hate
Gave you a shot, you dropped the ball
It ain’t my fault, I helped you ate
Bottle service in my section, model girls back in my suite
Blocks of white and pounds of loud off in my kitchen, we gon’ eat
I got pistols in my section case these niggas think we sweet
We got big old bags of money, we can throw this shit for weeks
Ain’t no pussies in my section ‘less them bitches bringing bottles
Spark these pistols in my section case these niggas got some problems

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
In my section
You see sparklers in my section, you see models in my section
You see goons, nigga try us make the news
That’s how we move, that’s how we move
Don’t go in the club without them tools
Can’t rock that set without them jewels
Don’t chase them hoes, we let ‘em choose

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
In my section
You see sparklers in my section, you see models in my section
You see goons, nigga try us make the news
That’s how we move, that’s how we move
Don’t go in the club without them tools
Can’t rock that set without them jewels
Don’t chase them hoes, we let ‘em choose

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
In my section we be turnt
Ain’t no tellin’ who you might see with me
Real niggas, model bitches
Haters on the other side and they feelin’ me
Millionaires in my section
Pocket full of faces, chains on slavery
From the slums to poppin’ ace of spades bottles
Like Drake, nigga we made it
Niggas slept on me like pillows
Now I pull up in that Benzo
Fishbowl, no tint on my windows
Diamonds clear, they look like windows
MIA or we at lear
Turnt up every day how we live
What’s on my left wrist cost a crib
I had this foreign whip ‘fore the deal
Living this lifestyle give me the chills
I was just chasing my dream, Meek Mill
I got them goons in my section with sticks
Them bitches they wanna be ‘round ‘cause we rich
We goin’ up like a Bic, we lit
I’m fresh as fuck, someone take me a pic
I could take home any ho in this building
But I’d rather fuck a rachet bitch

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
In my section
You see sparklers in my section, you see models in my section
You see goons, nigga try us make the news
That’s how we move, that’s how we move
Don’t go in the club without them tools
Can’t rock that set without them jewels
Don’t chase them hoes, we let ‘em choose

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
In my section
You see sparklers in my section, you see models in my section
You see goons, nigga try us make the news
That’s how we move, that’s how we move
Don’t go in the club without them tools
Can’t rock that set without them jewels
Don’t chase them hoes, we let ‘em choose
