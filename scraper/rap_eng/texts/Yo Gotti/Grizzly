I pull up in my cutlass hat cocked handling business
Fresh up out of court and I'm right back on my grizzly
I be on my grizzly, I be on my grizzly
Ball like the playoffs Aston Martin take off, take off, take off
Yeah bitch, take off
Got some goons, I got some goons that what I call a face off
Nigga face off, swish, nigga face off
Hit him in his ass
But I was trying to take his face off

50 packs of kushin nigga balling like I'm Zeebo
Rich crest apartments I'm the neighborhood hero
More white than mayo now can you say swish?
I'm the king of Memphis and I'll be balling like a bitch
On my dope shit, coke shit, niggas know me
I'm the blueprint, the street shit, niggas owe me
Offense, water boy, you ain't play no D
Wide open shot and you ain't take it, you in the D league
Draft pick nba shit, Davis Stering
Contract and the chopper bet these pussys gonna learn
You try to run go catch the people
Shot his ass with a buzzer beater
Nigga hit the trunk so many times
Nigga knocked the tweeters up out his speakers

I pull up in my cutlass hat cocked handling business
Fresh up out of court and I'm right back on my grizzly
I be on my grizzly, I be on my grizzly
Ball like the playoffs Aston Martin take off, take off, take off
Yeah bitch, take off
Got some goons, I got some goons that what I call a face off
Nigga face off, swish, nigga face off
Hit him in his ass
But I was trying to take his face off

Got on my old school penny's
See they know I'm winning, few real niggas like me but it really ain't many, true
I'm from North Memphis, (I am) chillin' on the courtside
Grew up down on Watkiss, went to school in North Side
Bitch I'm out here getting it may God be my witness
Any nigga put his hands on me then there gon be a killing
Heart got no feelings, top got no ceilings
Cruising past Bill top dropped where the bitches
Peabody Presidential sweet 220
Tonight I'm hitting the pure and I'm a make it rain 20's
I'm on young nigga shit, I swear I sold it all
I had bricks the color of Battier and white as Marc Gasol

I pull up in my cutlass hat cocked handling business
Fresh out of court and I'm right back on my grizzly
I be on my grizzly, I be on my grizzly
Ball like the playoffs Aston Martin take off, take off, take off
Yeah bitch, take off
Got some goons, I got some goons that what I call a face off
Nigga face off, swish, nigga face off
Hit him in his ass
But I was trying to take his face off
Swish swish, swish swish
Handling business, right back on my grizzly
Swish swish, swish swish
Handling my business, right back on my grizzly
Hey, on my grizzly, right back on my grizzly
On my grizzly, right back on my grizzly
Kill 'em, my grizzly, kill 'em, my grizzly
Handling business, right back on my grizzly

I pull up in my cutlass hat cocked handling business
Fresh up out of court and I'm right back on my grizzly
I be on my grizzly, I be on my grizzly
Ball like the playoffs Aston Martin take off, take off, take off
Yeah bitch, take off

Hit him in his ass
