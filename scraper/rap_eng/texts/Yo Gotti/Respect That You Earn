[Intro: Wale]
I call her thirst trap shorty, oh, haha

[Intro 2: Yo Gotti]
Ay you know
They say its a man's job to respect a woman
But me personally
I feel like a woman 'posed to give a man something to respect
Now it ain't wrong for thinking that is it
So I ain't wrong for thinking this

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Want me to buy you a bag but is you worth it
Now I ain't perfect
And I just followed you on Instagram
Are you really into women and you get around, no I ain't judging
I'm just asking if that's fair to say
But either way it's my opinion, you know, give or take
I told this model chick
Little girls look up to you and the things you do
Every nigga you work with, you're screwin'
So you know when she grow up, you know what she gon' do
She like, you don't know me, you don't pay my bills
You don't know my struggle
I'm like, that shit real but it is what it is but I know you lying
I know what's real, I know your worth
I know that purse, ten bands shawty, you can't pay your bills
You one of them?

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Girl, I'm gonna give you the respect that you earn from me
That you earn from me, that you earn
What you make me do
That's what I'm gonna do, for you
Girl, I'm gonna give you the respect that you earn from me
That you earn from me, that you earn
What you make me do
That's what I'm gonna do - give you the respect you earn

[Verse 2: Wale]
I kiss on your neck, what you wanna get out of this?
Would you feel disrespected if I said you fat as shit?
If I called you my bitch when I'm with my partners
See it as a badge of honor
Or just be like no Wale, don't call me out on my momma's given
Namesake but she whispers mine when I'm in her thighs
And I leave her in her feelings 'cuz I never leave her dry
Some ill advice, lying to her is ill advised
She know these Jones from a Jone but I still give her time
I try to follow her, everybody want her
Ain't worry about nothing, she gon' work that body
And I unfollow though my eyes
Still on her knowing I'm still caught up
I call her thirst trap shorty

[Hook]

[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
She lives for the night life
And that's all right
But she wants to be treated like somebody wife
But you can't be table-hopping in the club
Trying to drink free
Then come back to my table
Trying to stand next to me
Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Hook x2]
