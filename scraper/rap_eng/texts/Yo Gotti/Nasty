Nasty, Nasty
Nasty, that nasty
Nasty, Nasty
Nasty, you're so nasty
Million dollar trap, but the spot so nasty
White so clean but the pot still nasty
Nasty, Nasty
Nasty, that nasty
Nasty, Nasty
Nasty, you're so nasty
A hundred on the coup, so the whip look nasty
Fifty on the watch, so my wrist look nasty

[Verse 1 - Gorilla Zoe]

Now if I drop it off, it gon' be all clean
Same color as your daughter prom limousine
Remember Master P? Yellin' triple b, (UGH)
Now True Religion jeans with the double seems
I'm on a scene, we trappin' fire
I finna wake the fiends, I drive that type of car (?)
(?), I heard he help you out
EW bitch you finna die
Anberlin and CSI
R.I.P. dearly departed, sorry my two three retarded
Pop the clip, and pulled it farted, shit it
Never missed a target, and man I never missed a meal
I'm eatin', never ever starvin'
I'm trapping at the Starvin' Marvin
Now I'm black card chargin'

Nasty, Nasty
Nasty, that nasty
Nasty, Nasty
Nasty, you're so nasty
Million dollar trap, but the spot so nasty
White so clean but the pot still nasty
Nasty, Nasty
Nasty, that nasty
Nasty, Nasty
Nasty, you're so nasty
A hundred on the coup, so the whip look nasty
Fifty on the watch, so my wrist look nasty

[Verse 2 - Yo Gotti]

I just got a set, and a brand new scale
(?), now I'm back out of jail
I been on the run, but I been havin' fun
Just took my permit, but I still got a gun
Hundred round drum, hundred grand chain
Five dolla bitch, million dollar brains
All I rock is white, I be so unique
Photo Aston Martin, they call it the repeat
And me, I'm from the streets, I never repeat the shit I heard
Never describe the shit I saw, never complained about no loss
I'm a boss, throw a cross, and it's off with your head
You tryin' to make a hit and I'm tryin' to dodge the Feds

Nasty, Nasty
Nasty, that nasty
Nasty, Nasty
Nasty, you're so nasty
Million dollar trap, but the spot so nasty
White so clean but the pot still nasty
Nasty, Nasty
Nasty, that nasty
Nasty, Nasty
Nasty, you're so nasty
A hundred on the coup, so the whip look nasty
Fifty on the watch, so my wrist look nasty
