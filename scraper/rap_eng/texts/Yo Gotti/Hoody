[Verse 1: Allstar]
For my niggas that's a normal day
Toting Glocks like it's normal but they normally throw away
On the real nigga I'm known to blow an O of dro a day
Automatic haters yea the hoes know I'm safe
Any bitch any caper i feel like i can pull it
Get rich in the hood if the nigga had a deal on pussy
Call me pullover, I'm so fucking hoody
My eyes low I know, I'm so full of goodies
CEO we at the block, all the pussys shookin'
Load the k's load the Glock find the rookies take they cookies
Like Ricky Ross to the limit how I push it
My money right I floss all day I bubba kush it
I ain't blood I ain't g I ain't crip like [?]
Before a nigga kill me, bet his life get tooken
The number you got, call me for the dope or to book me
Fuck my enemy i kill him fuck who looking

[Chorus: Allstar]
Call me pullover I'm so fucking hoody
My eyes low I know, I'm so full of goodies
Call me pullover, I'm so fucking hoody
My eyes low i know, I'm so full of goodies
I'm so fucking hoody, I'm so fucking hoody
Fuck my enemies I kill em fuck who looking
I'm so fucking hoody, I'm so fucking hoody
Fuck my enemies, i kill em fuck who looking

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Everyday I step out the house I'm hoping it's a drought
That means there's money to be made you know what I"m talking about
Cocaine prices right, niggas start taking shit
Last year I sold a nigga 5 bricks of baby mix
Heard the word on the town niggas talking bout killing me
Down bad fucked up i know you niggas feeling me
Riding with that Glock .40 looking in my rearview
Riding down Adams then i make that right on Headveiw
Riding through the south because North Memphis stupid hot
Say the feds out, man I call them bitches super cops
IND the label, but it's like a game tho
Serve me out your house
Man I'm coming through that same door
All black straps out you know what I came for
Straight face plate, if you wanna then your brains go
211 turned to 187 bout this foolishness
Yo Gotti North Memphis we be on that bullshit

[Chorus: Allstar]


[Verse 3: Allstar]
Yesterday it was all black blame it on the Genesis
Really I was lurking, plotting on a nigga I'm finna get
People came to scoop some niggas, some of them finna snitch
Streets finna dry up and we going to reap the benefits
Cheap cheap prices shorty shipped outta memphis quick
I flood cashville where it ain't never been 10 a brick
They hollering 10 a key but they ain't really seen it
I'm hollering 10 a half, and yeah I really mean it
I'm riding rentals stay high and keep switching numbers
You asked me why Because I'm focused, it was a busy summer
The next time you see me, it might be on the news
But I ain't never scared, don't get that shit confused
Rap pays the bills but I'm strapped and I will
Say fuck my deal what it is with the steel
So go on throw your life away and blame it on the pills
But I got niggas around me that do this shit for the thrill
For real

[Chorus]
