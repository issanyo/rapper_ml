[Intro: MoneyBagg Yo]
Ayy real talk like
She be killin' me, tryna talk like me and shit
Use the words I use and shit, you crazy girl
You a reflection of me though, I ain't trippin'

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
I count the money, you count it too
'Cause you a reflection of me shawty
I don't fuck with them niggas, you don't fuck with them
You a reflection of me shawty
When it's time to ride you loading up
'Cause you a reflection of me shawty
I'm takin' chances, you takin' chances
You a reflection of me shawty
When I look in the mirror, what do I see?
A reflection of me
When I'm in my ride and I look to the side
A reflection of me
You're a reflection of me, you're a reflection of me
You're a reflection of me shawty

[Verse 1: MoneyBagg Yo]
It took a while for me to understand you the one for me
You know how that shit goes
Now they using us for example when they post relationship goals
I be sacking the dope, you do it too
When I blew the money you blew it too
I be tripping when you try to talk like me
Swear you run this shit, like a boss like me
You be talking and kicking shit with my partners
Me and you both rock Balenciagas
We  head of the game like we the Carters
When we talking 'bout money we count a lot of it
When she hear about niggas in the streets hating
She be like fuck them niggas bae
I never trusted them niggas bae
I'll load up and bust at them niggas bae
I swear she so gangster, she G, a reflection of me
Shawty something to keep
She like riding luxury, peep all the fuckery
Shawty a female version of me

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
I count the money, you count it too
'Cause you a reflection of me shawty
I don't fuck with them niggas, you don't fuck with them
You a reflection of me shawty
When it's time to ride you loading up
'Cause you a reflection of me shawty
I'm takin' chances, you takin' chances
You a reflection of me shawty
When I look in the mirror, what do I see?
A reflection of me
When I'm in my ride and I look to the side
A reflection of me
You're a reflection of me, you're a reflection of me
You're a reflection of me shawty

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
My lil young bitch, she a hundred
She just help me count a hundred
All her friends writing checks, fraud, doing scams
She just being honest
Three sisters,  she the youngest
She ain't never broke a promise (not once)
Last nigga left her, lucky me
Yeah he gotta be the dumbest
You're a reflection of me
If a nigga say hi you don't speak
You don't argue about niggas and bitches (at all)
Just talk about how we going to eat (we is)
The Bentley truck droppin', it's sweet
I want red, I think she want pink
Her lil friends on the low tryna fuck on me
She ain't tripping 'cause she know what's up with me
Ain't no sneaky shit, we got them levels
And we fuck these hoes together
And you're a reflection of me
So we gotta ball together

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
I count the money, you count it too
'Cause you a reflection of me shawty
I don't fuck with them niggas, you don't fuck with them
You a reflection of me shawty
When it's time to ride you loading up
'Cause you a reflection of me shawty
I'm takin' chances, you takin' chances
You a reflection of me shawty
When I look in the mirror, what do I see?
A reflection of me
When I'm in my ride and I look to the side
A reflection of me
You're a reflection of me, you're a reflection of me
You're a reflection of me shawty
