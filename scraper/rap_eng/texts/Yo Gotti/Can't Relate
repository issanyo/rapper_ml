[Intro: Yo Gotti]
Yo

Fihhhh!

Hey!

[Pre-Chorus: Diggy Simmons]
Say, girl, whatcha say?

Private jet, that’s state to state
Scrub nigga I just can't relate (can't do it)
I just can't relate (can't do it)
I just can't relate (can't do it)
Baby, I can get you anything that you want but ya man just can't relate (can't do it)
Say, girl, whatcha say?
I been getting the money, eh
Private jet, that’s state to state
Scrub nigga I just can't relate (can't do it)
I just can't relate (can't do it)
I just can't relate (can't do it)
Baby, I can get you anything that you want but ya man just can't relate (can't do it)

[Chorus: Diggy Simmons]
He can't relate

Baby, I can get you anything that you want but ya man just can't relate
He can't relate

Baby, I can get you anything that you want but ya man just can't relate

[Verse 1: Diggy Simmons]
I ain't nothing but a real one
You already know what it is
Baby, I been gettin' to the money so a nigga what
Put you on the spot with a view, baby, you know we can live
And every time I drop it's a two, baby, you know we be fly up in it

[Bridge: Diggy Simmons]
Cause you so far from regular
Expensive, exquisite even
You deserve vacations every weekend
You deserve time in a Rolex incognito
You so far from regular
Beauty without a reason
Now you need a beast, I'ma go hard for ya
All up in the sheets, I'ma go hard for ya

[Pre-Chorus: Diggy Simmons]
Say, girl, whatcha say?
I been getting the money, eh
Private jet, that’s state to state
Scrub nigga I just can't relate (can't do it)
I just can't relate (can't do it)
I just can't relate (can't do it)
Baby, I can get you anything that you want but ya man just can't relate (can't do it)

[Chorus: Diggy Simmons]
He can't relate
He just can't relate
Baby, I can get you anything that you want but ya man just can't relate
He can't relate
He just can't relate
Baby, I can get you anything that you want but ya man just can't relate

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I don't run to the money
The money be running to me
The lil' nigga you with
That nigga mean nothing to me
But you, you really mean something to me
I can put you on [?], you something to see
But me, I'd rather take you to the hood
So you get honest at me (I am)
You got it, the money don't mean shit
I met you in my dreams shit
See a nigga on some him shit
And I'm on some team shit
Big wings shit, with-a-long-white-dress-if-you-do-the-right-thing shit
You a million dollar bitch, that's a hundred dollar nigga
Shawty ain't never seen shit

[Pre-Chorus: Diggy Simmons]
Say, girl, whatcha say?
I been getting the money, eh
Private jet, that’s state to state
Scrub nigga I just can't relate (can't do it)
I just can't relate (can't do it)
I just can't relate (can't do it)
Baby, I can get you anything that you want but ya man just can't relate (can't do it)

[Chorus: Diggy Simmons]
He can't relate
He just can't relate
Baby, I can get you anything that you want but ya man just can't relate
He can't relate
He just can't relate
Baby, I can get you anything that you want but ya man just can't relate

[Verse 2: Diggy Simmons]
Yeah, let them chat 'bout
Now let them get the money in the trap house
Living everything I rap 'bout
You want an Alexander Wang or a Gat blouse, pick
I ain't sharin', baby, ask out
Can't mention my
Go check your mailbox I sent you some things
But feel there's a need to explain, bang
You ain't never gotta sit in coach
In the winter I come find you when you ever need a coat
Ever see my kick it with them other niggas, no
And them other niggas know
I can't relate to them regular ass
Don't even pump regular gas
They can't relate
He can't relate
He can't relate

[Pre-Chorus: Diggy Simmons]
Say, girl, whatcha say?
I been getting the money, eh
Private jet, that’s state to state
Scrub nigga I just can't relate (can't do it)
I just can't relate (can't do it)
I just can't relate (can't do it)
Baby, I can get you anything that you want but ya man just can't relate (can't do it)

[Chorus: Diggy Simmons]
He can't relate
He just can't relate
Baby, I can get you anything that you want but ya man just can't relate
He can't relate
He just can't relate
Baby, I can get you anything that you want but ya man just can't relate
