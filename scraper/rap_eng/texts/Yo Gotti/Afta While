[Hook: Moneybagg Yo]
After while I’ma pull up in that Bentley
With like three bad bitches in it
After while I’ma go cop me a semi
Say fuck everybody, give these niggas the business
After while I’ma stunt on everybody
Said I wouldn’t do it but nigga I did it
After while I’m talking all this Federal shit
They gon’ fuck ‘round and give me a sentence
After while (after while)
After while (after while)
After while (after while)
After while (after while what?)
After while I’ma go fuck on your bitch
After while you gon’ get hit in your shit
After while I’ma go ice out my wrist
After while you love so hard you get rich
After while

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
You keep it real with some motherfuckers then after while
You realize they don’t hold loyalty, like my jewelry they watered down
I know some young bulls who’ll do whatever to whoever, go mode, Snootie Wild
I just might spaz and catch me a murder like OJ did, beat the shit at trial
After while I’ma pull up in that big B, for who can’t comprehend, Bentley truck
After while I’ma pull up on my jeweler, tell ‘em bust the Rollie down like a bale of kush
When I pop me a perc
After while I jump in her, make her squirt, yeah
I come up from the dirt
Now I’m in Dallas balling like Dirk, yeah
Running ‘round spreading rumors, telling lies
After while you get hit in your mouth
Ten thou, all hundreds, small waist up, down in my Louis V pouch
After while they gon’ have to pay me least fifty K to come stand on they couch
Finding a way out, changing my routes
‘Cause I’m straight up out the dope house

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Plug came, dropped the pack off, it’s been awhile
They say you a real nigga, but your niggas foul
Last time I seen a brick on grandma’s floor, it’s been a minute
Last time I fucked your bitch, pussy so good I fell asleep up in it
Check the banker how I know I’m with it
Breaking news, they say he know I did it
Shots fired, left you niggas in it
Channel Five, ten people in it
And I just bought me an FN
And I just bought me a new Benz
And I just bought me a crib in Calabasas
I can’t wait to move in
I’m tryna meet a Kardashian (Khloe)
I already know the Kardashians (know it)
I’m tryna get out of trapping
I’m tryna get into fashion
Clap for my haters ‘cause they made me proud
Tell ‘em suckers that they not allowed
Bugatti on ‘em out the wild
