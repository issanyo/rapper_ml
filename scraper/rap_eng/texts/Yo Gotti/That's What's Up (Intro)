[Verse 1]
This tha intro to my life, in-trip to my world
Ridgecrest Apartments, movin' dat white gurl
Posted up on tha corna, movin' dat marijuana
Glock .40 on my hip, holl'in out "Chu ain't wann' it!"
My Glock stay cocked, rocks in a match box
Head garlind' on lock - I'mma go getta!
A nigga raided ya spot, conviscated cha block
And he didn't git shot - you'se a ho' nigga!
And I rememba you, do you rememba me?
8th grade leavin' school, rockin' up a quarter ki (Dat's wussup!)
T-tops on dat 'Z', I was passin' ya
Fish tail swervin' witcha bitch on tha passenger, side
Shawty, let's ride (Whuddup!), rims still spinnin' so shawty let's glide (Whuddup!)
She askin' me why, I don't git, high
Cause bitch, I make 50 off a 3,5
And dat's wussup!

[Hook]
See me nigga, say "Wussup!"
Wanna be me nigga - dat's wussup (Yeh!)
'Bout ya dolla, pop ya colla then you holla - dat's wussup (Yo Gott-Ayye!!)
See me shawty, say "Wussup!"
Wanna fuck me shawty, dat's wussup (Yeh!)
Dat's wussup, dat's wussup, d-dat's wussup, dat's wussup (INE!)
