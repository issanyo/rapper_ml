[Yo Gotti]
I just signed Moneybagg on a yacht
He said fuck an album budget he want blocks
He said fuck them haters we gon make em hot
This 250 nigga, go buy you a drop
Walk thru for 50, nigga went and bought me a watch
Since you hating on me, come get you a job
Heard you telling on your homies boy you rotten
See me four deep with my homies, boy I'm plotting

Facts

[Moneybagg Yo]

Hood nigga, all this fame don't excite me

Facts

[Yo Gotti]
I don't care where a nigga from, what he claim (facts)
If the nigga a real nigga we could get some money

Know this rap shit changed my life, I know I'm blessed for that
Just spent 500 on a drop head, I ain't stressing that
I know Blac Youngsta worth a million I ain't question that
Don't disrespect me and try to squash it, no reversing that

Facts

Come sign with me and get a pack
Or play with me your shit gon' splat

[Moneybagg Yo]
Trap house jumping off the meter like my shows and features
Before they started sending threats, I always kept a heater
Bring some pills in the back and plenty bowls of reefer
Them other niggas was bustin' heads, I always kept em cheaper
I remember selling bombs, then I blew up like a bomb, profits off the bomb
Put it in my charm, couple karats on my arms
Real nigga just putting words together, I'm not no rapper
And them niggas just putting words together they not factors

Facts

[Yo Gotti]
And I go federal, federal, federal
I'm on perks, xans, et cetera
Honey, came home with me, she was a miracle
Fucked the lil bitch, to date might
Niggas gon talk, but I don't be hearing them
Niggas gon bluff, but I don't be fearing them

Facts

Off the yacht, the shit be clearing them
The bullets, the shit be piercing them
Nigga want war they best insuring them
