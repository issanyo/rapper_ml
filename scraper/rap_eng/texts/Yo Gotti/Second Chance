[Hook]
Baby mama left a nigga got another man
Didn't work out, tried to come back and get a second chance
Second chance. second chance
Yeah I love that ass to death but ain't no second chance
If I fucked off wit ya friend would I get a second chance?
Guess I fucked to many hoes, I need a second chance
Second chance. second chance
She may love your ass to death but ain't no second chance

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
See bitches think they slick but then they act like niggas
Gone fuck off and then come back and act all sentimental
(BITCH!)
Pack your bags get out my house you know the biz
And you bet not have no nigga round my fuckin kid
See loyalty's a must & trust is all we have
And ima street nigga so you know the math
Dont put me in no shit cause you know what I will do.
And if a nigga know my business I may have to kill you
Street code, freak hoes
Fuck a bitch, anything goes
I guess I fucked too many hoes, its karma maybe
Finally got the one I like & she gone drive me crazy

[Verse 2]
It goes once upon a time
I was on my grind
Yeah I fucked a couple hoes
Yeah she caught a nigga lyin
Then I went out on the road, then she wanted to pay me back
So she fucked another nigga, when I get back ima kill her
(DAMN!)
Gave that ho the world, she had my lil girl
Got a nigga hot, put me on the spot
Guess thats what I get, nigga knocked my bitch
One thing bout it though we never workin out shit bitch
I dont need no counselor
Im the type to cancel her
Used to buy her cars & Louis bags and shit to pamper her
I guess I fucked too many hoes, its karma maybe
Finally got the one I like and she gone drive me crazy!
