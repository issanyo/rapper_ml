[Verse 1]
I heard them killer's looking for me
They just trying to next me
Makes been that popo been through my trap
They trying to arrest me bitch lying like she pregnant
She's just trying to stress me and
The preacher man want me to come to church so he could bless me
And im thuggin, my confession
I ain't lying come and test me
Your baby mama text me
She wanna come sex me
Made her fuck another bitch
Turned her to a lesbi
Heard you on some hatin shit
And you ain't never met me
I got bitches trying to stress me
Bitches trying to sex me
Shout out to my plug
He tryna connect me
Police tryna arrest me, won't let them bitches catch me
Had to kill one of them niggas
Cause he tried to finesse me
She laughed like I fucked her cause she just wanna let me
I'm the man motherfucker and what you wanna bet me?
Kush man motherfucker, used to smoking Reggie well say damn
Motherfucker, fa fa fa fa fa fa test me

I'm fresh my stylist dress me
She praying for a blessing
I fucked her then I kicked her out
She wanted to caress me
Low pros them Pirelli's
Kush smoke got me smelling
I done fuck you bitch
Cause she was too happy when she met me

I got it on my own started on my own
Got my money up and built my team strong
Bitches wanna fuck and they won't leave me 'lone
Got it on my own started on my own
Got it on my own started on my own
Got it on my own started on my own
I got it on my own started on my own
Got my money up and build my team strong

Police tryna indict me, tryna send them dogs to bite me
No my bitch ain't no faithful
And no ain't nobody gonna rite me
Well I ain't got no friends
And naw that ain't my wifey
Ain't signing none of you niggas
Cause you don't see the shit that I see
Imma say whatever I want
If you don't like it nigga then do something
My young niggas ain't got no life
They geeking to shoot something
My shoes cost 600
My T-shirt cost 2 something
I got it on my own
Now get off your ass and do something
Now everybody wanna kidding me
Everybody wanna be friending with me
Ain't hold me down when I was in the pen
I ain't never rode on my enemies
That young nigga from DC
They linked that with Tennessee
When I die fuck that Hennessey
You niggas better remember me
I'm gone

Got it on my own started on my own
And working with them... p's and keys started from them zones
You smoking on that Reggie and my weed be strong
Pussy yo team ain't bout shit and nigga my team we on
I got it on my own started on my own
Got my money up and built my team strong
Bitches wanna fuck and they won't leave me 'lone
Got it on my own started on my own
Got it on my own started on my own
Got it on my own started on my own
I got it on my own started on my own
Got my money up and built my team strong
