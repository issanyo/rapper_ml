[Intro: Trouble]
Man, it's too much of this shit

[Chorus: Trouble]
Plenty, plenty, plenty
I got too much of this shit
Plenty, plenty, plenty
Plenty, plenty, plenty
I got too much of this shit
Plenty, plenty, plenty
Plenty, plenty, plenty

[Verse 1: Trouble]
Paper, I got plenty
Bitches I got plenty
Toll on the thot, her body science, I'ma get it
Stay in and out of my business
Don't move until I don't finish
Meaning, I'm tryna skeet-skeet-skeet all up in it
Ride out for my pimping, I slide up in my Balenci's
Yeah, all I want is to get fucked out, too many sixes
Today, I'll be rockin' more than real bitches
My speed got no limits, take a look around, you see plenty
I got plenty
Cars, whores, doors, white girls come into my shows
Body rolls till they see me
See me? Then you see plenty
No future now, we're winning, we're winning
But no more dirty Sprite for me
I pour the lean out cause I'm good with the Henny

[Chorus: Trouble]
Plenty, plenty, plenty
I got too much of this shit
Plenty, plenty, plenty
Plenty, plenty, plenty
I got too much of this shit
Plenty, plenty, plenty
Plenty, plenty, plenty

[Refrain: Yo Gotti]
Plenty girl, plenty real nigga ride with me
Plenty paper, plenty haters, go get high with me
Plenty street niggas, they see eye to eye with me
Plenty young niggas, busted time with me
Plenty gold, plenty real niggers ride with me
Plenty paper, plenty haters, go get high with me
Plenty street niggas, they see eye to eye with me
Plenty young niggas, busted time with me

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Plenty niggas act like bitches, they should chain six
Plenty pussy ass niggas should just stop flexin'
House full of white, girl full of me
Count a hundred dollar bill, nigga get it how you live
Plenty bad bitches, couple ratchet hoes
Plenty face shots, that means the casket closed
Plenty spots, plenty whips, I took plenty troops
He came with me, that nigga make plenty flips

[Chorus: Trouble]
Plenty, plenty, plenty
I got too much of this shit
Plenty, plenty, plenty
Plenty, plenty, plenty
I got too much of this shit
Plenty, plenty, plenty
Plenty, plenty, plenty

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Now I'm not friendly, and I got plenty
Back and forth on this layup, I'm on I-20
You see my bankrolling, it's back bus George skinnin'
I bought a Rolls Royce, I cashed out and I don't trust it
I play football and I go to sleep stuntin'
Never too much, never too much money (It's Gucci!)
Kicking in with trouble and the comma's keep coming
Problem like the problem like the drama, keep coming
I ball every day, to me is Super Bowl Sunday
I took a fifty with me, King of Diamonds brunch
I can't get enough of Gucci, she's a Gucci man son
Tell Plazy, I wonder when they got plenty of money (It's Gucci!)

[Chorus: Trouble]
Plenty, plenty, plenty
I got too much of this shit
Plenty, plenty, plenty
Plenty, plenty, plenty
I got too much of this shit
Plenty, plenty, plenty
Plenty, plenty, plenty
