[Chorus]
Big wheels on my Phantom, got it sittin' crooked
3 birds for a show, nigga gon' book it
I’m LeBron James, you a fuckin' rookie
Ya broad want a ticket I’ma go and book it
Book it, book it, I’ma go and book it
Big dollars in my pocket, got me sittin' crooked
Crooked, crooked, I'ma go and book it
Big dollars in my pocket got me sittin' crooked

[Verse 1]
100 racks in my pocket, I can’t even walk
50 hitters with me nigga, I set it off
Poppin' bottles, blowing money, I’m just having fun
Me and my niggas fresh to death, upper echelon
I got buckles on my shoes and they gold bitch
Open my doors in reverse, this that Rolls bitch
CMG Bentley coupe, that’s a cold kit
See the bird, double R, that’s some cold shit
All I rock is white, still on my old shit
All my niggas solid, all my hoes thick
DJ drop that Gotti, this that dope boy shit
Smelling like a bag, I’m looking like a brick

[Chorus]
Big wheels on my Phantom, got it sittin' crooked
3 birds for a show, nigga gon' book it
I’m LeBron James, you a fuckin' rookie
Ya broad want a ticket I’ma go and book it
Book it, book it, I’ma go and book it
Big dollars in my pocket, got me sittin' crooked
Crooked, crooked, I'ma go and book it
Big dollars in my pocket got me sittin' crooked

[Verse 2]
They say I signed to Tip, I said "When I do that?"
Me and Tip'll conversate bout where them choppas at
I be where them goonies and them robbers at
So when you see that Phantom dog don't follow that
Ridin' in a rental, gettin' that pack off
Fish scale yay I call it bath salts
Trap doing good, I can’t complain
It's been a damn good month, I moved like 20 things
Then went and bought that new Jeep, that SRT
Yo ho suck dick on sight, ASAP
Just got a yellow AP and that bitch nasty
When I popped out my second week I coulda bought a Aston

[Chorus]
Big wheels on my Phantom, got it sittin' crooked
3 birds for a show, nigga gon' book it
I’m LeBron James, you a fuckin' rookie
Ya broad want a ticket I’ma go and book it
Book it, book it, I’ma go and book it
Big dollars in my pocket, got me sittin' crooked
Crooked, crooked, I'ma go and book it
Big dollars in my pocket got me sittin' crooked
