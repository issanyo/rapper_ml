[Chorus:]
Whole bunch of money on my mind Im a bank teller
Pharmaceuticals in the trap nigga I'm a dope seller
Margiela thousand dollars for the tennis shoes
Make the money, blow the money, blow the money, make the money

[Verse 1:]
I just blew a sack in Saks
Closet looking like it's Neimans
Smoking on that woo sipping Act got me feeling like a demon
Got me feeling like a monster plus Im bumping Monster by my nigga Future
Met a bitch so real told her I'm marry her I can tell the future
Yea bitch Im a prophet
Wake up everyday and profit
Wake up everyday with new haters knowing niggas can't stop it
You a hater boy I want to thank you
Motivate me to get this paper
Motivate me to fuck your bitches thank me later
Million dollars and I threw it
Half a million on a coupe
2 million dollar budget I said fuck it swinging out the stu
I been trapping out the booth
Coke prices through the roof
Yea the prices prices hella high high cause it's desert storm DJ Clue

[Chorus:]
Whole bunch of money on my mind Im a bank teller
Pharmaceuticals in the trap nigga I'm a dope seller
Margiela thousand dollars for the tennis shoes
Make the money, blow the money, blow the money, make the money

[Verse 2:]
In the hood giving loans
Investment property buying homes
Invest in pack that strong
Fuck a CP I trust no man
Uncle Sam I be taxing niggas then withdraw it like a ATM
Hood rich off of trap music but Im popping pills bumping EDM
I just been moving the bank then put a [?] in the vault
Had to withdrew bout a bag money been all in my thoughts
Tell the security we good
Boy we come straight out the hood
We don't trust niggas with badges only fuck bitches with asses
Nigga late on a payment make him pay interest
Nigga late on the payment take em to the trenches
I can count the money backwards
Yeah I rap but I'm not a rapper
Life a movie but I'm not acting ain't no cut scenes straight action

[Chorus:]
Whole bunch of money on my mind Im a bank teller
Pharmaceuticals in the trap nigga I'm a dope seller
Margiela thousand dollars for the tennis shoes
Make the money, blow the money, blow the money, make the money
