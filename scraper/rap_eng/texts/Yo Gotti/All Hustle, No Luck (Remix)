[Bridge: Lantana]
All I ever wanted, was some money get some money
All I ever wanted, was some money get some money
Turn a dollar to 20, 20 to a fifty, fifty to a band
Hold up, wait, I'm going in

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
All white phantom like it come off the boat

A duck a fake bird, mean it mix with that cut
You quacking ass niggas, need to shut the fuck up

These boys wanna take me off my feet, but that's the thang
They know that I'm packing that I ain't scared to cock it back and bang
I'm riding round on them fo's and vogues and they clack and swang
Yeah you sittin' on 22's but they factory mane
You're trying to be like me, you see but the fact remain
For me it's easy to offer protection bro its a natural thing
Pulled out, show it up, suicide doored up
Smoked out and they pour it up, if I came down then it slow it up
Like oh man, hold up, PA get throwed up
That's Lantana they can't stand us, it's all hustle no luck

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
(4 in the morning I ain't seen my bed)
All I ever wanted was the money and the cars
Bag full of dope and a pretty ass broad
Never did I think about the time or the charge
I was busy worrying bout buying out the bar
I was busy flying out linking up with Czar
When you all got money, it's hard pointing out the star
When them dollars fall, them hoes start to follow
We just seat back and gloat cause we got 'em
He want war, it's on sight when I spot 'em
Can't do haters, head shots when I dot 'em
Yeah, it's all hustle, no luck
Get this money and we ain't giving no fucks

[Hook: Lantana]
Uh, All hustle no luck, Uh, All hustle no luck
Uh, All hustle no luck
Is that, is that all hustle, no luck, I bet I get me rich dawg
