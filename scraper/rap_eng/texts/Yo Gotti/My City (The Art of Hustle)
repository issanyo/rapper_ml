[Intro: Yo Gotti]
The teacher asked me what I wanted to be
I stood in front of the whole class and I told her I wanted to be a gangsta

[Hook: K. Michelle (Yo Gotti)]
Every day somebody’s killed in these streets
Whether innocent or guilty (It’s my city nigga)
And you don’t have to travel to another world
Cause there’s a war zone in my city (It’s a war zone out here)
Oh Memphis, oh Tennessee
No other place will be home for me (Ever)
All the people, all the struggle
In a world full of fakes, my city make me a real hustler
(True hustler)

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
First Three Six break up, and every day I wake up
A nigga got a problem with me
I got a hundred clips, a hundred guns, a hood full of killers
And I dare something could happen to me
See my city at a different state, its no honor
We used to have to make it through the year now it's the summer
And everybody mob somthin’, everybody rob somethin’
Everybody scrap and everybody shot somethin’
Young niggas like ISIS
Killin’ like they got a license
Life used to be priceless now it’s worthless
Niggas gone on missions ain’t even worth it
Homie chill (chill)
Lil homie chill (chill)
Lil homie don’t respect the big homies no more
Drakos and choppers, no more handguns no more
Four deep, four hundred shots, everybody under 16
I remember I was getting’ bricks for the 16
The city changed nigga

[Hook: K. Michelle]
Every day somebody’s killed in these streets
Whether innocent or guilty
And you don’t have to travel to another world
Cause there’s a war zone in my city
Oh Memphis, oh Tennessee
No other place will be home for me
All the people, all the struggle
In a world full of fakes my city make me a real hustler

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
You know it’s rules and regulations when you king of the city
And niggas comin’ for the throne, some niggas don’t make it home
Ain’t talkin’ that rap shit, I’m speaking about real beef
Where big homies can get wet and niggas can’t get sleep
Put a 10 on a nigga, fuck that put a 50
Make his friend do the nigga, this Memphis, Ten, nigga
Home of the poverty, home of the robberies
I be goin’ through some real shit like nigga don’t you bother me
It’s goin’ down in the DM
Nah nigga it’s goin’ down when I see him
Biggest record of my career, I’m becomin’ a star
And I’m shootin’ an AR out the car
Just look at your favorite rapper
Just be patient, he gon’ fuck up, he a Memphis nigga
Maybe I will, maybe I won’t, thuggin’ in a nigga
Money don’t change that, fame can’t change that
I’ve done shit to niggas in the streets I can’t take back
So every second of my life I got a gun and I hate that
But this Memphis, if you get caught without you gon’ regret that
So fuck it

[Hook: K. Michelle]
Every day somebody’s killed in these streets
Whether innocent or guilty
And you don’t have to travel to a foreign land
Cause there’s a war zone in my city
Oh Memphis, oh Tennessee
No other place will be home for me
All the people, all the struggle
In a world full of fakes my city make me a real hustler
