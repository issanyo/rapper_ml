[Intro: Smokepurpp]
Huh, Lil Purpp
Lil Purpp bless yo' trap
Huh, already know what I'm saying
Oh my god, Ronny

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
In the club with the heat, bitch
Niggas know I'm in the street, bitch
Thirty niggas and we deep, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch

[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
Snuck in the club with the ratchet
I got twin Glocks, same daddy
Let a pussy nigga have it
I'm Houdini with the magic
Ten toes deep
Pussy nigga wanna fight me
Backwood looking like a tree
Cookies on me so I reek
Ride around pimping hoes, nigga
All my hoes got pretty toes, nigga
Ruger on me, blow a nose, nigga
Lil Purpp'll take a soul, nigga
Bitch, I'm me
Lil Wayne '03
Michael Jordan '93
Poppin' outchea like a creep

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
In the club with the heat, bitch
Niggas know I'm in the street, bitch
Thirty niggas and we deep, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch

[Verse 2: Smokepurpp]
Came in with yo' hoe
Came in with a pole
Selling cocaine on the road
Serving cocaine through the road
Ronny J on the beat, bitch
I'm still balling like the Heat, bitch
Put a nigga in a seat, bitch
Make a mute nigga speak, bitch
I came in with two hoes
Bitch, I snuck the pole
Bitch, I'm in the club
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
In the club with the heat, bitch
Niggas know I'm in the street, bitch
Thirty niggas and we deep, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Vegetarian to the beef, bitch
Yo Gotti, I do street shit
Yo Gotti, I do elite shit
Versace flops in my suite, bitch
Balenciaga on my feet, wooh!
Blue Ferrari, drop the top, ooh!
Red Ferrari, drop the top, ooh!
I be still on the block, hooh!
Got the lean and the purple, bitch
I got straps like I'm Urkel, bitch
Throw that ass in a circle, bitch
Mixed a Xan with a Percocet
Herm√®s belt with the Gucci set
Fiji diamonds, yeah, they VVS
Pharmaceutical, I'm CVS
I don't know these niggas, bitch

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
In the club with the heat, bitch
Niggas know I'm in the street, bitch
Thirty niggas and we deep, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
(Sosa, baby)

[Verse 4: Chief Keef]
I'm such a player with a bow tie
Foe nem with me for the long ride
Yo bitch pull up on me like roadside
And make it very scary like Poltergeist
48 what I'm gon' smoke tonight
They like "Chief Sosa, could you lower the price?"
Gamble with your life, nigga, roll the dice
All this bread, had to get a slice
Bitch, I'm greedy, I started off humble
Nigga, you can get yo' ass dropped like a sunroof
Feds tryna solve a young nigga like a puzzle
Cause it can go pop and it won't be a bubble
Change my identity, I wouldn't be in trouble
Got the blickies on us, then it wouldn't be a tussle
Big bread on me and it's ready to crumble
Shorties hop out dressed up like plumbers

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
In the club with the heat, bitch
Niggas know I'm in the street, bitch
Thirty niggas and we deep, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
I don't know you, you know me, bitch
