[Verse 1: Payroll Giovanni]
Woke up and I felt like balling
Ain't even got up out the bed and money calling
Got washed up, threw on some new shit
Left my old jewels at the crib, got on my new kit
Did this shit, should I cop some rims on these hoes?
Or should I ice my whole watch?
Fuck it, I’mma do both!
Shining on these bitches for the days I couldn't
Gotta look good cause I know they looking
Flying through my hood, just scoop my cheese
For my young wild niggas that be hustling P's
I’mma get money fanatic, drug money in the mattress
Chopper in the closet, work in the attic
Grew up with bosses, learned from my losses
We really do this, we don’t just talk it
Niggas want fronts, old bitches want me back
We the Detroit Big Tymers, how you love that?
(Bitch)

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
Woke up and I felt like balling
Ain’t got up out the bed, money calling
Took 27 bands and they’re all in
36 wholes, meet me at the mall then
Woke up and I felt like balling
Ain't got up out the bed and bitches calling
Forgis on the Monte cause they like that
Doughboyz Cashout, yeah they like that

[Verse 2: HBK, Doughboy Quis, Doughboy Dre]
Ten bands calling, I ain’t even brush my teeth yet
Drown in the water, nigga fuck getting my feet wet
Killers on my side, and they ain't never went to recess
Up all night, counting money, I ain’t sleep yet
Way before this rap shit, nigga I was on
Kush bows in the basement got it smellin strong
Had to switch my phone, feds trying to tap my shit
Cavalli this, Gucci that, I'm on some stunting shit
I’m in my coupe looking cool, ho, see me and true
Before snow gave us a chance at 40 bands worth of jewels
You will end up on the news if you fuck with my gang
Your best friend will kill you, what your thought on your brains?
I'm swerving lane to lane in my whip on Rouches?
You call that girl your wife, I just call her a groupie
I stay rocking Gucci, either that or Gisueppe
Talking loud on my cell, trying to show off my prezzy, bitch!

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
Woke up and I felt like balling
Ain’t got up out the bed, money calling
Took 27 bands and they’re all in
36 wholes, meet me at the mall then
Woke up and I felt like balling
Ain't got up out the bed and bitches calling
Forgis on the Monte cause they like that
Doughboyz Cashout, yeah they like that

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
First thing I gotta say, nigga free meech
Next thing I gotta say, I got ‘em 23
Doughboyz Cashout, who me?
Rolls Royce catch them out, wifely
On set, all day nigga got them wifey
She’s a ho nigga, why you’re trying to wife a freak
It’s so cold in the D, no weather
Young nigga thugging, plus they got beretta's
Home of the hustlers, you know they getting cheddar
Your price high, but my price better
Make it rain on the bitch, shawty where your umbrella?
Dope boy shit, nigga I ain’t never tell a soul
Nigga dippin in the pack, fucking what they nose
Nigga fucking off the set, trickin to the hoes
Talk a lot of gangsta shit, but be the first to fold
Yo Gotti a real nigga, everybody knows!

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
Woke up and I felt like balling
