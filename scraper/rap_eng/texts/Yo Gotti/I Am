[Verse 1]
Young nigga in the hood watching out for hustlers
All these niggas with me I love em like my brothers
I am the struggle
I am the hustle
I am the city
I'm the pot in the kitchen
I used to save pennies, now I stay next door to Penny
Hardaway nigga got my meals the harder way
Sellin' crack music, now I run some smarter ways
Exit the game and got rich that's a fade-away Ha
What a millionaire look like

Turn a nine to a half
Turn a brick to a jag
Nigga you do the math if you can add right
Mixtape doing shows for the forty
All I need is one mic and a Glock 40
Tour bus full of killers
Whenever I'm in the building
Then build the cake to the ceiling
Can't describe the feeling

[Verse 2:]
I am the legend fortunately
I am success fortunately
Imagine life in the Crest
Young nigga with techs
Head shots in the day
Throwing our lives away

I come from that land home
Ounce of yay will kill a nigga
And I was the man. Ho
Shots fired
Bullets fired
Coming out that van door
Family crying
Seen that shit so many times
Heart cold
