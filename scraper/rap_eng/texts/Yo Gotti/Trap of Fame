[Intro]
Niggas talking big money
Niggas talking little money
I've seen it all man
They thought this shit a never come
Ups Downs Ups Downs Ups
This might be the last one
Dope Boy forever
Forever

[Hook]
Put me in the trap of fame (I'm the trap of fame, in the trap of fame)
Yeah they'd say the trap will change (Say the trap will change, say the trap will change)
[?]
Only to the cocaina
And now I'll put it all in my name
Cause I never ever gave a blackout to the game
This the trap of fame
Trap of fame
Trap of fame
They'd say the trap will change
Trap will change
Trap will change
This the trap of fame
Trap of fame
Trap of fame
And trapping will never be the same
Never be the same
Never be the same

[Verse 1]
I'm the type of millionaire
I'm the type of real nigga
If you could have a bed full of fifties
Right there, my ill figure
Ran off, ran off on the plug
Damn right, I'm an ill nigga
I ain't never had a problem shooting that pistol
Ever since I was a lil' nigga
This the trap of fame
Sold a lil' dope but the trap was lame
Word is your word and your name your name
Fuck up your brain and black out of the game
Got a little money but you sold your soul
Now its came down [?]
Bring it with the hood every time I scope
Hundred semi full of bricks and a thousand boats
That the trap of fame
That the Heisman trophy
I'm still from the game
Touchdown with the [?]
Field goal, field goal, fuck that, I'm going for the extra point
[?] my job, Employee of the Month
MVP, nigga what I want

[Hook]
Put me in the trap of fame (I'm the trap of fame, in the trap of fame)
Yeah they'd say the trap will change (Say the trap will change, say the trap will change)
[?]
Only to the cocaina
And now I'll put it all in my name
Cause I never ever gave a blackout to the game
This the trap of fame
Trap of fame
Trap of fame
They'd say the trap will change
Trap will change
Trap will change
This the trap of fame
Trap of fame
Trap of fame
And trapping will never be the same
Never be the same
Never be the same

[Verse 2]
I use to sell an O for the six fifty work
In a two door white Sedan dirt
Black top convertible
Play with me, I'll murder you
How you the plug in the town nigga?
Nobody ever heard of you
Type of nigga to pull up in [?]
And never heard another word from you
Kidnap his ass (Ransom, Ransom)
Clean face but I'm a jack boy
Sell him two bricks for the forty flat
[?] to his house, get it right back
Will you tell me what happened to him?
I fuck with you, get it right back
Cut throat city, I'm from North Mem and we let em work it out cause he was boys with me pussy
This the trap of fame
I really love the game and everything come with it
I'll be a number one draft pick
If you compare the streets to an athlete
Ball ball ball hard, boy I got money like I'm an athlete
And they gonna have a party in advance with the best of the hustles on the day they retire me

[Hook]
Put me in the trap of fame (I'm the trap of fame, in the trap of fame)
Yeah they'd say the trap will change (Say the trap will change, say the trap will change)
[?]
Only to the cocaina
And now I'll put it all in my name
Cause I never ever gave a blackout to the game
This the trap of fame
Trap of fame
Trap of fame
They'd say the trap will change
Trap will change
Trap will change
This the trap of fame
Trap of fame
Trap of fame
And trapping will never be the same
Never be the same
Never be the same

[Outro]

Tenth, eleventh grade [?]
