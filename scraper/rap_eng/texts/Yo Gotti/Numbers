[Chorus: Belly]
I pull up in four-door Bugattis
Four-wheel Ducatis
Got at least two hoes beside me (ten)
Threesomes like a hobby
Addies made me zero in
Two point nine, these five tsunamis
Seven boppers in the lobby
We the new Illuminati
All my bitches keep six
In case twelve tryna find me
Do the math, do the math
45's like the army

[Verse 1: Belly]
I'm a pipe her like Rowdy
Free Max, free Bobby
Get Whoopty on the phone
He'll know what to do with the body (death)
Set Persiles on a little couch, till I put my mama in a real house
Pills all in my little pocket, and they got me geeking like a meal house
Too many fake waves
It's a real drought
I feel like eight days, with the AK earnin' real clout
Fuck your two cents
You wouldn't even give me two cents when my pennies scuff
Earned it all it was never luck
Millionaire with the semi tucked
Now you wanna pull a Hemi up
Just so you can come and drink the Henny up
Fake shit, it was never love
And really fuck it if it ever was

[Chorus: Belly]
I pull up in four-door Bugattis
Four-wheel Ducatis
Got at least two hoes beside me (ten)
Threesomes like a hobby
Addies made me zero in
Two point nine, these five tsunamis
Seven boppers in the lobby
We the new Illuminati
All my bitches keep six
In case twelve tryna find me
Do the math, do the math
45's like the army

[Post Chorus]
Doing numbers, doing numbers (add it up)
Doing numbers, doing numbers (add it up)
Doing numbers, doing numbers (add it up)
Doing numbers, doing numbers (add it up)

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I just counted five million dollars cash
All 5s, 10s, and 20s
Got to know that that's the dope money
Got to know I got the code, homie
Drink, bring a chopper hit him up, aye
Plank, play dead sit him up, aye
Bricks on bricks, yeah we Billy Love (Billy Love)
Bitches act thirsty so we fill em' up
Ion like the rap game (ion love the rap game)
Ain't none these niggas real as us (ain't none these niggas, none these niggas)
Going back to the trap game (going back to the trap)
Selling bricks out the Bentley truck (cocaine Bentley truck)
Then I'ma hit 'em up
I used to be a stick 'em up
Black hoodie with the ski mask
When you see me nigga get em' up (you know what it is)
I'm a dope boy cause I sold dope, boy
You ain't no plug cause you owe one boy
You ain't cool with no Mexican, you don't know one boy
If you say you got M's then show one boy
Just bought the Patek, the one with no ice
Just knocked that bitch, the one with no lights
And I used to get government assistance, food stamps, no lights

[Outro: Belly]
Doing numbers, doing numbers (add it up)
Doing numbers, doing numbers (add it up)
Doing numbers, doing numbers (add it up)
Doing numbers, doing numbers (add it up)
