[Intro]
Pssht, Run it

[Verse 1: Jallal]
Say word around town Im just shutting them up
They were acting all tough, they ain't give me no love
On my IG they lurk
Man look at Jallal
I made XXL so Im never gon fall
I ain’t even ever close to done yet
They say I fell of I ain't ever left
Niggas try and act like its a contest
No competition when you are the best

[Chorus]
Never done this for play
I put that on me
Pray God keep me strong in belief
Been moving im caught up in it deep man this was always meant to be

Never done this for play
I put that on me
Pray God keep me strong in belief
Been moving im caught up in it deep man this was always meant to be

[Verse 2: Jallal]
They want that old money, I smell like gold money
Who make the day sunny, thats the lord sonny
Why they acting so funny, some people kill for money
They just for show honey, trust me they so nutty
When they come around they just run they mouth
I don't even know what they talking bout
All around town they just stunt and bluff
They stay hating on the up n up

[Chorus]
Never done this for play
I put that on me
Pray God keep me strong in belief
Been moving im caught up in it deep man this was always meant to be

Never done this for play
I put that on me
Pray God keep me strong in belief
Been moving im caught up in it deep man this was always meant to be

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
When I was young they labeled your boy damn fool
22’s enough for my Benz truck and my old school
You get the picture the money it ain't the issue six figures before the rap game now I'm a little richer homie
Nigga get it how you live
Broke niggas don't chill
Still a real nigga and Im the real shit
Real recognize real
I represent the boy J dis nigga a real one yeah!

[Chorus]
Never done this for play
I put that on me
Pray God keep me strong in belief
Been moving im caught up in it deep man this was always meant to be

Never done this for play
I put that on me
Pray God keep me strong in belief
Been moving im caught up in it deep man this was always meant to be
