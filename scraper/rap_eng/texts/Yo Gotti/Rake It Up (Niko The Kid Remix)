[Intro: Yo Gotti]
Aw, this the strip club anthem, nigga, what's up?
Them AMG 63's

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
I tell all my hoes, "Rake it up
Break it down, bag it up"
Fuck it up, fuck it up (fuck it up, fuck it up)
Back it up, back it up (back it up, back it up)
Rake it up, rake it up (rake it up, rake it up)
Back it up, back it up (back it up, back it up)
I tell all my hoes (what?) "Rake it up
Break it down, bag it up" (bag it up, bag it up)
Fuck it up, fuck it up (fuck it up)
Fuck it up, fuck it up (fuck it up)
Fuck it up, fuck it up (fuck it up)
Rake it up, rake it up (rake it up)

[Breakdown: Yo Gotti]
Fuck it up, fuck it up (fuck it up)
Rake it up, rake it up (rake it up)
Fuck it up, fuck it up (fuck it up)
Rake it up, rake it up (rake it up)
Fuck it up, fuck it up (fuck it up)
Rake it up, rake it up (rake it up)
Fuck it up, fuck it up (fuck it up)
Rake it up, rake it up (rake it up)

[Drop: Niko The Kid]

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
I tell all my hoes, "Rake it up
Break it down, bag it up"
Fuck it up, fuck it up (fuck it up, fuck it up)
Back it up, back it up (back it up, back it up)
Rake it up, rake it up (rake it up, rake it up)
Back it up, back it up (back it up, back it up)

[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo! Brought out the pink Lamborghini just to race with Chyna
Brought the Wraith to China just to race in China
Lil' bad Trini bitch but she mixed with China
Real thick vagina, smuggle bricks to China (woo)
I tell all my niggas (yo), cut the check (cut the check)
Buss it down, turn your goofy down (down) pound
I'ma do splits on it, yes, splits on it (splits)
I'm a bad bitch, I'ma throw fits on it (fits)
I'ma bust it open! I'ma go stupid and be a ditz on it (ditz)
I don't date honey (no), cookie on tsunami (oh)
All my niggas wife me once they get that good punani (oh)
I think he need a Bonnie, I might just let him find me
Never trust a big butt and a smile, word to Ronnie
Re-rep Queens like Supreme, ask Webb and Nitti
A-ask Bimmy and Joe, nigga run me my dough
Wr-wrist game is freezin' like it wait in the cold
Nickname is Nicki, but my name ain't Nicole, name ain't Nicole (grrr)

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
I tell all my hoes, "Rake it up
Break it down, bag it up"
Fuck it up, fuck it up (fuck it up, fuck it up)
Back it up, back it up (back it up, back it up)
Rake it up, rake it up (rake it up, rake it up)
Back it up, back it up (back it up, back it up)

[Drop: Niko The Kid]

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
I tell all my hoes, "Rake it up
Break it down, bag it up"
Fuck it up, fuck it up (fuck it up, fuck it up)
Back it up, back it up (back it up, back it up)
Rake it up, rake it up (rake it up, rake it up)
Back it up, back it up (back it up, back it up)
I tell all my hoes (what?) "Rake it up
Break it down, bag it up" (bag it up, bag it up)
Fuck it up, fuck it up (fuck it up)
Fuck it up, fuck it up (fuck it up)
Fuck it up, fuck it up (fuck it up)
Rake it up, rake it up (rake it up)
