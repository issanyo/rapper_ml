[Hook]
The door to the trap open 24 hours, 24 hours, 24 hours
The money so dirty, gotta put it in the shower, put it in the shower, put it in the shower
With the trap house doors open 24 hours, 24 hours, 24 hours
Money so dirty, gotta put it in the shower, put it in the shower, put it in the shower

[Verse 1]
This that old flow when we were wrapping bricks
This that Gotti, Mr. Fuck a Nigga Bitch
This that old me when I was hitting licks
Young street nigga, still with the shits
We thuggin', we ain't fucking with the law nigga
We got pictures of Big Meech on the wall nigga
Cause we gon' play the trap niggas
And we gon' rob the rap niggas
[?]
From coming to your house and he still owe me
Choppers on his ass, choppers on his ass
Pull up on him, kill him, put it in the bag

[Hook]
The door to the trap open 24 hours, 24 hours, 24 hours
The money so dirty, gotta put it in the shower, put it in the shower, put it in the shower
With the trap house doors open 24 hours, 24 hours, 24 hours
Money so dirty, gotta put it in the shower, put it in the shower, put it in the shower

[Verse 2]
We got little head hundreds, call 'em midgets
Brick from my advance when I slide to the kitchen
And them choppers, they my motherfucking managers
Don't play me like no motherfucking amateur
Show money nigga you gon' get it
Tell my goons, make sure they hit it
And when they pick her down, [?]
You can't get no piece and ain't no discussing it
If the laws at the door, we crushin' it
If the robbers at the door, we bussin' it
There's my Bentleys and [?] drive through
[?]

[Hook]
The door to the trap open 24 hours, 24 hours, 24 hours
The money so dirty, gotta put it in the shower, put it in the shower, put it in the shower
With the trap house doors open 24 hours, 24 hours, 24 hours
Money so dirty, gotta put it in the shower, put it in the shower, put it in the shower
