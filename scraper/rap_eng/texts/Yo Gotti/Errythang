I've seen the money come, seen the money go
It ain't tricking if you got it that's one thing fo' sho'
Set the standards high, sit the Chevy low
One thing for certain you can't lose no ho from chasin dough
That's on errrythang, that's on errrythang
Seen the paper come and go just like the weather change
That's on errrythang, that's on errrythang
Gotta whatch these bitches cause they out here playin head games

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
I got a pocket full, of that green shit
Getting head by some bitch who made the dean's list
Hair graded, talking Tony the Tiger
Ridin in that white Mercedes, I call it Delilah
24's, pigeon toes
Plus the coupe came with a bitch that's from the Poconos
I watch my money come, never see it go
Hit the club and watch me blow it like a saxophone
That's on errrythang, I'm talkin errrythang
Told my jeweler I got 50 for my pinky ring
Straight cash, hoppin that Spyder thaing
Never was no local joker, don't say I ain't told you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I say my family good family good, my niggas too
I just bought my bitch a Benz and I call it boo
I'm chasing money, you niggas chasing hoes
We call em plays, we call em pick and roll
Mean the Chevy sit up high, the Lambo sitting low
I'm doin ... till it lose control
I'm ridin swervin, I'm ridin serve
My paper comfort then I guess these niggas money nerd
That's an errythang, you a real nigga
Bitch I'm talking by myself, cause I don't feel niggas
I feel realer, that's on errythang
I'm here in the club tonight and bitch I'm rocking erry chain

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]

Went to the dealership, 100 thou' in cash
Brand new say I'm fifty, drop that on the dash
Better get you one, read that of the tab
That's on errythang boy got that McGuyver swag
Stunting on em, Evel Knievel
Swag so illegal, house as this big as cathedral
That's some other shit, probably with my other bitch
Hopping out that mother ship, my pistol got that rubber grip
Real nigga, sir call the G's
Better watch these niggas cause they snitching just to get a plead
That's real talk, money my order
That's on errythang don't say I ain't told you
