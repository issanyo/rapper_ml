Shoot at you reload it and then I shoot again
Diamonds reel these bitches in

I don't do abortions so I told the hoe to swallow
She said Don't call her a stripper
So I told her she a model (you a model)
Playin' all the models bust down rollie
Flexin' on the gram knowin' that you owe me
Shawty said she love me so I told her show me
Dry as Dallas Texas go and get my codeine
And if you get pulled over tell them you don't know me
Bring a couple friends we can have an orgy
Got it
