[Intro: Lil Durk]
Approach me right, nigga
Gang, L

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Pour the drank
I'm just sippin' good while they rollin stank
Diamond chain, bitches get so thirsty for these Cuban links
Real nigga, don't gotta prove it period, fuck what you think
Real killers, yo ass will be dead before you even blink
Gang
Walkin' like I got money, I'mma do the money walk
Walkin' like I got money, I'mma do the money walk
Walkin' like I got money, I'mma do the money walk
Real nigga with a lot of bands, let the money talk

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Pulled up to the trap, dropped me a load off
Bitch geek when they see me ride with these doors off
Wanna fuck with my chain taking her clothes off
Pour a seven-with-seven, bitch I gotta doze off
Rollie cost me thirty thous, make my jeweler proud
Glock drum, move the crowd, opp pack smoking too loud
New Mike's three-fifty, new yeezy boosts two thous
I used to want one bitch, broski I got two now
Strippers want these singles bitch, come dance for it
Looking at my watch, bitch I paid bands for it
And she want the Molly quick, Aiki got a gram for her
Trap nigga with a lot of cash, and I'm paid for

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Pour the drank
I'm just sippin' good while they rollin stank
Diamond chain, bitches get so thirsty for these Cuban links
Real nigga, don't gotta prove it period, fuck what you think
Real killers, yo ass will be dead before you even blink
Gang
Walkin' like I got money, I'mma do the money walk
Walkin' like I got money, I'mma do the money walk
Walkin' like I got money, I'mma do the money walk
Real nigga with a lot of bands, let the money talk

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Four Cuban links, that's a quarter mil', thats the Money Walk
Little nigga tweeting on twitter, tell em let the Money talk
I let the shooter bang it out, all that flexing ain't about
Big money, big gun, big boss shit nigga, my bank account
Millionaire status, billionaire focus
Got a plug in the yay', I got bricks in a Focus
I got plug like the socket, real plugs you can't stop it nigga
Whenever we talk about money, mention me I'm the topic
I been state-to-state, real estate, then I hit Priv√©
I just ordered steak, in the ace, tryna' digest the hate
I been in UK, getting the pounds, tryna hol it down
Represent the town, tryna ride my wave, you bound to drown

[Hook: Lil Durk]
Pour the drank
I'm just sippin' good while they rollin stank
Diamond chain, bitches get so thirsty for these Cuban links
Real nigga, don't gotta prove it period, fuck what you think
Real killers, yo ass will be dead before you even blink
Gang
Walkin' like I got money, I'mma do the money walk
Walkin' like I got money, I'mma do the money walk
Walkin' like I got money, I'mma do the money walk
Real nigga with a lot of bands, let the money talk
