Make that money pile, bitch, make that money pile, ho x 4
I’ve been all across the globe seen a lot of hoes
And you say you different show me, show me somethin I ain’t never seen before
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it girl
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it girl

[Verse: Waka Flocka Flame]
All the hard and fallies trippin, tweeking off lollies
Sippin' lean with polly, rollin' up Bob Marley
Exotic dancers around me, pussy so wet it might drown me
Lame niggas wanna down me, real niggas don’t ground me
South side Clay county, swear to God they made me
Real nigga 80's baby, diamond school like the AC
She gonna fuck no maybe, make a bad bitch go crazy
Lately everywhere I went I'm throwin money
Flexing, never seen a Versace, all I know is ball shawty
Drop that ass baby, let me see you bust it
If I spend a lot of cash, would you let a nigga touch it
Her ass fat and she know it, these 30 bands I’ma throw it

Make that money pile, bitch, make that money pile, ho x 4

And you say you different show me, show me somethin I ain’t never seen before
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it girl
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it girl
Been all across the globe seen a lot of hoes
And you say you different show me, show me somethin I ain’t never seen before
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it girl
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it girl

[Verse: Yo Gotti]
It’s a drought and these streets and I gotta hella plug
It’s a half of brick mill moment and I’m in the club
Ride my rim so big and I’m in the what the fuck
I keep throwin the money and they keep piling up up
Going hard and boa, hundred band nigga we don’t play
Camouflage no paparazzi, all night nigga like a fuckin na
She a bad bitch chick she can stay cocky, I’m a real nigga I’ma stay poppin
Magic city run this ,nigga I gotta flow nigga gun sloppin
So many warns they sleepin up, you got it bad we gonna pick you up
Bands nigga bandz a make, bandz a make that bitch fuck
My bag look my sack right never knew a nigga acting right
Her home alone she’ll play bone, no panthoe for ass right

[Verse: Gucci Mane]
I’ve been all around the country and the ho go mother Sunday
I’m in anish boy they fronted told the wild this beg for money
She loves this but this she does it
I’m honestly so decided, pretty as Pocahontas
I met her and then we humped,feel so flawless
Can’t call my monsters I roll with monsters
Don’t guide no tosses
I swear she eat you like Jefrey Douglas, like Jessy Jackson
I had the struggle, life is a hustle I had to juggle
Like Jessy Juggle I have the muscle and use a line
You have a caffin respect the game I had the bossom
I’ma have the paper you have the trouble
You need a favor, you need some paper I’ll make you rain
I leave it pour
