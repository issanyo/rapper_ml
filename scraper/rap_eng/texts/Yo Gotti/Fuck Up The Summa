[Chorus: Bump J]
I'm about to pull them whips out and fuck up the summer
Finna fuck up the summer
Your niggas some bitches
Your bitch is a gunner
Finna pull out them big ol' sticks with clips
That look like a comma
All your niggas some bitches
Your bitch is a gunner
Finna fuck up the summer
Finna run up them numbers
You told the folks everything you know
And we don't know nothin', no
We stackin' them hundreds on hundreds
My niggas get to that money
Finna fuck up the summer
Finna fuck up the summertime

[Verse 1: Bump J]
I'm addicted to stuntin'
Extended clip and that's thumpin'
I do not want your woman
That bitch ain't know nothin'
She all on my bumper, I run her and gun her
Then I'ma let Money hit her
When we done with her, come and get her
If you gettin' to that money I'll lay your ass down
If I can't get no money with you
I ain't even finna play with her
Fuck a Chevy, I'm a Wraith nigga
Fuck your buzz, mine way bigger
How it feel to kick it with a made nigga?
With a paid nigga? We so up
Sittin' high in the nosebleeds
Audemars for an OG, fuck a Rollie

[Chorus: Bump J]
I'm about to pull them whips out and fuck up the summer
Finna fuck up the summer
Your niggas some bitches
Your bitch is a gunner
Finna pull out them big ol' sticks with clips
That look like a comma
All your niggas some bitches
Your bitch is a gunner
Finna fuck up the summer
Finna run up them numbers
You told the folks everything you know
And we don't know nothin', no
We stackin' them hundreds on hundreds
My niggas get to that money
Finna fuck up the summer
Finna fuck up the summertime

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I'm from North Memphis
This shit like Chiraq
These youngins got Dracos and scarves on their heads
Like we in Iraq
Intercept your sack
Ain't no gettin' it back
Ain't no talkin' 'bout what we gon' do on no song
We just go brrrrat
Bump J, welcome back
Like you never left (welcome home)
And I'ma play right with my nigga forever
Play hoes to the left
CMG to the death
Got that .30 like Steph
Got them hoes like Hef
The hate bad for your health, yeah!

[Chorus: Bump J]
I'm about to pull them whips out and fuck up the summer
Finna fuck up the summer
Your niggas some bitches
Your bitch is a gunner
Finna pull out them big ol' sticks with clips
That look like a comma
All your niggas some bitches
Your bitch is a gunner
Finna fuck up the summer
Finna run up them numbers
You told the folks everything you know
And we don't know nothin', no
We stackin' them hundreds on hundreds
My niggas get to that money
Finna fuck up the summer
Finna fuck up the summertime

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Push
Here to fuck up the summertime
Let 'em know that the summer's mine
Let 'em know that the dog food got 'em lined up
It can hold a nine
When I say it can hold a nine
Then you know that means overtime
So you know that my young niggas got them big things
Shoot a hundred times
I told you a hundred times
Said this shit in a hundred rhymes
I'm the only dopeboy that's quotable past the borderline
Fuckin' way past the borderline
Nigga we can have a order-thon
Not talkin' Lambos or Ferraris, nigga, when I order mine

[Chorus: Bump J]
I'm about to pull them whips out and fuck up the summer
Finna fuck up the summer
Your niggas some bitches
Your bitch is a gunner
Finna pull out them big ol' sticks with clips
That look like a comma
All your niggas some bitches
Your bitch is a gunner
Finna fuck up the summer
Finna run up them numbers
You told the folks everything you know
And we don't know nothin', no
We stackin' them hundreds on hundreds
My niggas get to that money
Finna fuck up the summer
Finna fuck up the summertime
