[Intro: Sam Scarfo & Yo Gotti]
Yay slinger, yay slinger
"You got to go"
Off a half a O
Yay slinger, yay slinger
You know what it do, nigga
This the streets, my nigga, yeah
And she used to tell, "If you sell that shit, you got to go"
Yay slinger

[Hook: Sam Scarfo]
Sorry mama, all I am's a yay slinger
Yay slinger, yay slinger
And she used to tell, "If you sell that shit, you got to go"
Then I stacked a hunnid bands off a half a O
Yay slinger, yay slinger
Yay slinger, y-y-y-yay slinger
And she used to tell, "If you sell that shit, you got to go"
Then I stacked a hunnid bands off a half a O

[Verse 1: Sam Scarfo]
Since a youngin, all I wanted was a black Mercedes
Just turnt a half a mama to like thirty babies
Whip it good, till that thing crème brûlée
Keep a couple choppers loaded by the soufflé
Bitch flip, I'ma make the fucking bank stop
Got the kitchen hot as Hell, in my tank top
Shit still coming back, I'm like, "Fuck me" (Pause)
Knocking Bun B, all up in my Chuck T's

[Hook: Sam Scarfo]
Sorry mama, all I am's a yay slinger
Yay slinger, yay slinger
And she used to tell, "If you sell that shit, you got to go"
Then I stacked a hunnid bands off a half a O
Yay slinger, yay slinger
Yay slinger, y-y-y-yay slinger
And she used to tell, "If you sell that shit, you got to go"
Then I stacked a hunnid bands off a half a O

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I sell yay and it ain't no secret, Holmes
Used to keep that work inside my mama home
I don't like mobile phones, that's how niggas go [?]
And you can't owe me, homie, that's how niggas end up dead
I fuck with them birds, let 'em fly when they come
Can't keep 'em around 'cause we sell 'em so young
Swear I'd never look back if I get me a sack
Once I got me a sack, bitch, I never looked back
Million dollars off rap, how ironic is that?
In the booth with the block, guess I'm pushing that crack
CMG, them the letters, want a hunnid or better
Keep the strap on me, homie, niggas know it's whatever
Pushers know where he going, plug talking in snow
Plenty money in the streets, and if you want it, it's yours
I-I-I am Yo Gotti, I-I-I am the streets
Drug slinging, my nigga, and I'm playing for keeps

[Hook: Sam Scarfo]
Sorry mama, all I am's a yay slinger
Yay slinger, yay slinger
And she used to tell, "If you sell that shit, you got to go"
Then I stacked a hunnid bands off a half a O
Yay slinger, yay slinger
Yay slinger, y-y-y-yay slinger
And she used to tell, "If you sell that shit, you got to go"
Then I stacked a hunnid bands off a half a O

[Verse 3: Sam Scarfo]
Came up on a brick, I just bought a Rover
And couldn't give a bitch right now a colder shoulder
I'm on my money, I'm on my money
I don't think you understand how I'm on my money
You know Sammy, raw white is alright
Look at them powder burns, you been sniffing all night
My nigga Memphis out, fresh up off that murder wing
And you know the trap is up, booming like a Burger King
Best work is a Bentley, you sniffing Buick
Got them big, plump birds, call 'em Martha Stewart
And I'm here with the bitch, eye to eye with it
So when the price climb, you know a nigga climb with it

[Hook: Sam Scarfo]
Sorry mama, all I am's a yay slinger
Yay slinger, yay slinger
And she used to tell, "If you sell that shit, you got to go"
Then I stacked a hunnid bands off a half a O
Yay slinger, yay slinger
Yay slinger, y-y-y-yay slinger
And she used to tell, "If you sell that shit, you got to go"
Then I stacked a hunnid bands off a half a O
