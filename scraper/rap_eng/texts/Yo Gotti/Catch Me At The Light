[Intro]
It's Sha-motherf-nell, yeah, Yo Gotti

[Chorus:]
Catch me at the light, when you see me rolling
You ain't got a fast car, might as well keep going
Catch me at the right, and you better be riding right
With the suicide doors on the side
Catch me at the light, the light
I see you creeping up
If you want some conversation, speed it up
Catch me at the light
Catch me at the light
Buckle up, let me take you on a ride

[Verse 1: Shanell]
Pull up, top back, I'm back
Drop top's got me feeling so alive, oh yeah
In my new thing paint all black
Whips came got the haters hit the ties, oh yeah
I got 200 on the dash, looking like I'm flying in a space ship
I'm fin to play with
Cause if I'm talking to a man
He be right like me, me

[Refrain: Shanell]
If you're a maserati, hold up
Bentley, yeah hold in
Looking like a benz or a beamer where you going
Jaguar, elise, show me you can keep up with me
I'm ready to go

[Chorus:]
Catch me at the light, when you see me rolling
You ain't got a fast car, might as well keep going
Catch me at the right, and you better be riding right
With the suicide doors on the side
Catch me at the light, the light
I see you creeping up
If you want some conversation, speed it up
Catch me at the light
Catch me at the light
Buckle up, let me take you on a ride

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Yeah, yo
I may pull up in that Lambo, doors like Diani
Yeah me speak English but shawty this a foreign
Real shit, shawty this could be your rent
Need some excitement in your life and you looking boring
Let me hit you in the back of that Range Panoramic view
Murcie lane, at the light, it's just me and you
I got Raris with them horses, different color Porsches
If you got a need for speed, shawty know that we got choices
Shawty know that we got options, so if you into shopping
Buying bags is not a issue, having budgets not an option
You got that wide body like a steering
Got a nigga feelling sprung shawty like a Visa
All gas, no brakes, shawty that's a speed race
V-V12, vroom vroom, I can make your knees shake
I just need that green light (green light) yellow light
Slow it down shawty, I can do it right, I am

[Chorus:]
Catch me at the light, when you see me rolling
You ain't got a fast car, might as well keep going
Catch me at the right, and you better be riding right
With the suicide doors on the side
Catch me at the light, the light
I see you creeping up
If you want some conversation, speed it up
Catch me at the light
Catch me at the light
Buckle up, let me take you on a ride
