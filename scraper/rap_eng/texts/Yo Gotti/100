(Hook)
When I open my eyes, all I see is money
Lookin in the mirror, I see a nigga that wants 100's
Everything around me, everything I'm tied to
Real nigga follow me, I will not misguide you
I'm so 100

I'm so 100, I everything I tried too
Traphouse doin an 100 like a muthafuckin drive-thru
I'm so 100
Cause I don't know no other way
I ain't wit that fake shit
This the way that I'm gon stay

(Zed Zilla)
When I open my eyes all I see is money
So much hating from yo side but I been seen it coming
Don't ask me if I'm ridin
You gon know I'm so 100 when them bullets get the flyin
And them bitches get to runnnin
Get to duckin get to hidin
My chopper doin 100
So much smoke inside from outside
It look 100
Ay, look, I hold 100, leave a hole the size of a comet
Heard yo baby's mama's head, more than her bunny
I did this shit for me
Me and all mines
Niggas respect me
Cause they seen the grind
Kept it 100, each and every time
So I wasn't, I backed up off of one when I seen the signs

(Yo Gotti)
Dear real niggas let me introduce myself
I'm Yo Gotti, North Memphis, bitch, that's all I rep,
I been all round the world, I seen so many hoods
Broke bread with real niggas, make sure my people good
Put memphis on my back, drop cocaine on these tracks
Put extras on my sack, and keep my bitches on they back
Strapped ridin' solo, college shirt Polo
Fuck a bitch without a rubber nigga thats a no no
You niggas part-time realest shit, today you 100 but tomorrow you on ya period
I don't fuck with niggas period, I'm serious, fearless
Faggot ass niggas, you's too curious

(Hook)

(Sylver Karats)
I'm am so 100
Hoes be hatin on the d-low
But my Louis bag's worth three 0's
And it pause hoes like a remote
Catch me ballin wit my people's
100 bottles, V.I.P. ho
Y'all be fuckin just for liqour
Only two shots, you's a free-throw
I think these bitches swag is on missin me
I'm known for burnin paper, with Wiz Khalif
You ain't never seen this, miss
10-A-Key, Jimmy Choo, Remy, weed
Shinin like a Christmas Tree
I am A-1 yola, body bottle Coca-Cola
Human brick without the soda
Out your range, I'm in a rover
With the seats low, and the beat on
In my house shoes like I'm Dee-bo
If you really, really need snow
I can help you find Nemo

(Hook)
