Mama told me, she told me
Mama told me, she told me
These fuck niggas ain't your homies
Watch how niggas change up, they change up
That's why I keep one in the chamber
Cuz I’m gonna take one with me
Nigga say he gonna kill me, bruh
Yeah, I'm gonna take one with me
Shoutout to my mama cuz she didn't raise no hoe
She said "boy if you gonna be thuggin', you gonna be thuggin'for sure"
You ain't gonna snitch on nobody, you ain’t gonna fall out by hoes
And if them niggas your partners, you gonna stick with your woes
Mama told me, and warned me
Said once you get your money son let’s get a army
And you gonna keep it with you
Boy I’m talking ‘bout that pistol
I will tugging and plugging, play for the court that I’m rocking
Probably get to a brick stone
Try to stack up the profit
Call the plug on and copy
On school heavy and I drop it
Bitch stay on your mother play with the hood and I’m chopping
Mama told me, she told me
The fuck niggas such a homies
I try that nigga change it, they change it
Why I keep here in the chamber
Cuz I’m gonna take one with me
Yes I’m gonna take one with me
You see no kid around
Cuz I’m gonna take one with me
Mama stay on …on me, even thou I’m study lane niggas on me
And I’mma, I’mma do what mama told me
She told do not trust no bitch, so watch my homies
Slowly but surely, nigga I dig it up and cut the rollie
And the niggas with the bitch away, they show me
I seen a beat jiggy duggin
Down by his orgies, bitches nigga truly got
Ain’t just like the trophies
Nigga I’ma tell you like my mama told me
Niga be a rapper, she told me fuck the bitches
Don’t you love ‘em and do niggas undercover
Mama told me, she told me
The fuck niggas ain’t your homie
I try niggas change it , they change it
They why are here in the chamber?
So ain’t gonna take no women
Yeah ain’t gonna take no women
