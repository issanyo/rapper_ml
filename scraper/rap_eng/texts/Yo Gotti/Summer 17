[Intro: Rick Ross]
(Maybach Music)
You scared to die, nigga?
Open your eyes wide and I pray you are (huh)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm out on bond so I gotta beat it (huh)
All the dope boys say they wanna be me (boss)
I got a lick, boy, I got a lick (I got a lick)
2017 trust me, boy, this one is it
I used to smoke the weed until my fingers burn (huh)
Pool of bitches fuckin' me, I got 'em takin' turns (woo)
My nigga bought the stick but you wanna fade (fick)
Made runnin' in the bank a residential thing (huh)
All my niggas mad they like, "Fuck the world" (fuck it)
Back to standin’ on the Ave. with a couple birds
If you a killer, well I’m tryna see (huh)
'Cause callin' the police the only thing free (woo)
I had to park that purple Lamborghini​ (yummm)
And pull that Chevy back out on the cement (huh)
I'm from the city where they kill for nothin' (nothin')
And all Renzel do is push a button (woop)

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
I want my niggas rich by summer seventeen (let's get it)
I want my niggas rich by summer seventeen
I want my niggas rich by summer seventeen
(All my niggas! I'm talking all my niggas!)
I want my niggas rich by summer seventeen (Maybach Music)

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I had a quarter mil' when I was seventeen
Quarterback and quarter keys, plus I own the team (yeah)
Rather you than me, rather me than you (me, you)
Riding in that coupe, hanging out shooting (skrrt, skrrt)
Glass panoramic top, I don't got no roof (pew)
Your bitch wishing on a star, I can see the moon
I can count to a million with my eyes closed
And shoot a pussy with that chopper while I'm blindfolded (brrr)
Draco, Draco, Draco (Draco) fitted cap a halo (brrrr)
Activis and Faygo, no pussies on my payroll
It's 'bout to be a cold summer, hot winter (summer, winter)
This mid-March, I might make it rain 'til September

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
I want my niggas rich by summer seventeen (summertime)
I want my niggas rich by summer seventeen (all of mine)
I want my niggas rich by summer seventeen (summertime)
I want my niggas rich by summer seventeen (huh)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I'm out on bond so I gotta beat it (Lord)
Half a million to my lawyer 'cause he undefeated
Shots fired; you short of breathin'
Barefoot 'cause them kids took your Adidas (woo)
I'm keepin' fried fish up in my mama pan (mama)
How much y'all detectives call yo' boy the son of Sam (mama)
Sa ka fet shake up the block, that's with a hundred grand (Sa ka fet)
Put that voodoo on you niggas so that gun'll jam (woo)
You know them niggas killers how they name ring (boss)
You know them niggas winners how they chain swing (ah)
All the bitches sellin' pussy charge the same thing (okay)
Richest nigga in the hood, we call him Rain Man

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
I want my niggas rich by summer seventeen (summertime)
I want my niggas rich by summer seventeen (All my niggas, let's go!)
I want my niggas rich by summer seventeen
I want my niggas rich by summer seventeen

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Lord! I'm talking all my niggas!
All my niggas!
Every one of 'em, nigga
Summer seventeen
Summer seventeen, nigga!
