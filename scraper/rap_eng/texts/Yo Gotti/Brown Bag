[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
Baking soda on the counter
J's at the door
I got bails in the attic
Money in the floor
Brown bag, back and forth like a grocery store
Plastic bags, in and out and that shit filled with dope
Baking soda on the counter
J's at the door
I got bails in the attic
Money in the floor
Brown bag, back and forth like a grocery store
Plastic bags, back and forth and that shit filled with dope

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Yo
Ain't no credit when you shop with me
You want some credit, leave your car with me
I tell my bitch she gon' go far with me
But she may have to take a charge for me
Baking soda in the 'fridgerator
I got money, that shit come with haters
What you want, what you need
I got pounds, I got keys
I got Goyard, that's a bag
Go hard for the bag
I got no heart, I'm heartless
For the bag, I'm retarded
Birkin bag with the crocodile
Yeah my bitch been around
I gave my bitch a real bag
I got faith she gon' hold it down

[Chorus]
Baking soda on the counter
J's at the door
I got bails in the attic
Money in the floor
Brown bag, back and forth like a grocery store
Plastic bags, in and out and that shit filled with dope
Baking soda on the counter
J's at the door
I got bails in the attic
Money in the floor
Brown bag, back and forth like a grocery store
Plastic bags, back and forth and that shit filled with dope

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Yo
Why the trap smell like onions
What's that loud odor
I've been sackin' brown bags like I work at Kroger
Not concerned with no payment nigga, what the total
I jumped out my Bentley coupe into a Toyota
Seatbelt, rental car trafficking
Blood on my diamonds, bitch I'm African
Quit puttin' your bag on that 'gram, boy that real life
You'll have them feds and them robbers at you, real life
I put my money in the ground and molded
Put my trust in a nigga and he folded
Can't believe that nigga took the stand and told
Fuck your bitch in the trap the dick she rode

[Chorus]
Baking soda on the counter
J's at the door
I got bails in the attic
Money in the floor
Brown bag, back and forth like a grocery store
Plastic bags, in and out and that shit filled with dope
Baking soda on the counter
J's at the door
I got bails in the attic
Money in the floor
Brown bag, back and forth like a grocery store
Plastic bags, back and forth and that shit filled with dope

Yo
