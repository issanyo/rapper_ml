[Intro]
Broke niggas don't deserve it (skrrt)
Broke niggas don't deserve it (Hitmaka)
Broke niggas don't deserve it

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Go take it off right now
One on one, nice style (Yeah)
I don't know what the hell you waiting for (Wait)
I know you got them niggas paying for it (Yup)
These broke niggas don't deserve pussy (No)
These broke niggas don't deserve pussy (No)
These broke niggas don't deserve pussy (No!)
These broke niggas don't deserve pussy

[Verse 1: Blac Chyna]
Fuck you thought?
Think you bout to hop up out the whip, then hop up in here this pussy
Talk that talk, but when it's time to pop a band, you hop up here and you shook
Nothing better than them dollars, man, I fuck up more than your retirement
Sip Mimosas with Madonna, man
Fuck her face just like I'm Taliban
It's too dark in here, don't make me pull the TEC out
If your name ain't Benjamin, then what we talkin' bout?
You tryna fuck or nah?
Cause I got the hoes and all
Under the act they fall, and they don't do broke at all
Uh, yeah, to these broke niggas, don't deserve pussy
Got they pockets empty, but they all lookin'
Get a hundred bands every time they book me (Goddamn)
Take him to the mall, just to show it off
Big bag, take lil bag
If you wanna pay, then you gotta pay to ball

[Jeremih & Yo Gotti]
Go take it off right now (Take it off, take it off)
One on one, nice style (Let's get it!)
I don't know what the hell you waiting for (What you waiting for?)
I know you got them niggas paying for it (Let's go)
These broke niggas don't deserve pussy (Never)
These broke niggas don't deserve pussy (Nah)
These broke niggas don't deserve pussy (No!)
These broke niggas don't deserve pussy

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Ay, you the type of nigga, act like a hoe
So you the type of nigga, that don't deserve hoes
I got street nigga goals, wanna send all my niggas millions
When I fall in club VIP, I wanna fuck every hoe in the building
Taz's Angels on my list first
20 mil my net worth
Quarter mil my neck worth
Ten bands, my bitch purse
Birkin bag, Balenciaga's, brand new Givenchy, we swaggin'
Fell in love with the coco, baking soda, and the baggies
Broke niggas don't deserve pussy, and these pussy niggas don't deserve money
Pussy niggas want a tummy tuck, so I hit 'em up
Yeah that Glock, plastic surgery
I'm in the kitchen doin' surgery (Whippin)
I'm in your bitch knowin' you heard of me (Woo)
Send your hoe a emoji kiss, early
Like what a bag (Mula)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Go take it off right now
One on one, nice style
I don't know what the hell you waiting for
I know you got them niggas paying for it
These broke niggas don't deserve pussy
These broke niggas don't deserve pussy
These broke niggas don't deserve pussy
These broke niggas don't deserve pussy
