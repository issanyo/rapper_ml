Greedy Money
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry

[Verse 1]
I can't fuck with you no more, ho, and I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
You a disloyal ass bitch, ho, you sorry (you sorry)
You prolly ain't pregnant, ho, you flodgin' (you sorry)
That prolly ain't my baby, I need Maury (I'm sorry)
A ho gon' be a ho, they ain't a hunnid (they ain't a hunnid)
And when a nigga broke, them hoes act funny (they act funny)
My money hungry bitches, they can smell it (they can smell it)
Loyalty, them hoes can't even spell it (I'm sorry)
Ayy, you can give that ho the world, that don't mean shit (they sorry)
'Cause you can rent a ho, but you can't buy a bitch (I'm sorry)
I give it to you raw (I'm sorry), straight up and down (straight up and down)
If she complainin' and accusin', prolly fuckin' around (I'm sorry)

[Chorus]
A nigga gon' be a nigga, I'm just sorry (I'm sorry)
And a ho gon' be a ho regardless (regardless)
If you think she fuckin' off, she prolly (she prolly)
Think your nigga ain't real, then sorry (sorry)
I'm sorry (I'm sorry), bitch, I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
I'm sorry (I'm sorry), ho, I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
A ho gon' be a ho regardless (regardless)
A nigga gon' be a nigga, ho, I'm sorry (I'm sorry)

[Verse 2]
I like different type of bitches, I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
I could never be committed and I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
How often you gon' see me? Hardly (I'm sorry)
'Cause I don't want a girl, I want a party (I'm sorry)
I ain't talkin' on the phone, bitch, I'm straight textin' (textin')
I ain't goin' to the movies, ho, we straight sexin' (sexin')
Oh you ain't fuckin' first night? Ho stay flexin' (flexin')
A nigga call and she ain't answer, ho stay reckless (she sorry)
I got trust issues, that's some real shit (I'm sorry)
Give me head and kiss your nigga, you a ill bitch (ugh)
Go home like nothin' happened, that's some cold shit (ho, you cold)
And ask your nigga who he fuckin', that's some ho shit (them hoes)

[Chorus]
A nigga gon' be a nigga, I'm just sorry (I'm sorry)
And a ho gon' be a ho regardless (regardless)
If you think she fuckin' off, she prolly (she prolly)
Think your nigga ain't real, then sorry (sorry)
I'm sorry (I'm sorry), bitch, I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
I'm sorry (I'm sorry), ho, I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
A ho gon' be a ho regardless (regardless)
A nigga gon' be a nigga, ho, I'm sorry (I'm sorry)

[Bridge]
Sorry (I'm sorry)
Sorry (I'm sorry)
Sorry (I'm sorry)
