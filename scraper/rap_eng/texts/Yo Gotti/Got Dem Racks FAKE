[Verse 1]
I rock Gucci, Louie, Prada, niggas know I shop at Saks
Yellow-bone, super fine, you know I'm hitting it from the back
If you see me in the club, niggas know I got them straps
Security tried to search a nigga, but we come in through the back
See them sparklers in the air, you know the bottles on the way
C.M.G. taking over, man that's all the D.J. play
White on, white on, in the club my white on, shorty got something tight on
And if that's your bitch, then you may have to fight holmes
Gripping on her ass, niggas say I'm disrespectful
I pulled up, in that Lam', niggas say I disrespect them
If I want it, then I'm running fast, know they gotta catch me
Niggas shot at me and missed, whoa, know the lord blessed him
I sell dope, I fuck hoes, then make songs bout this shit
I rob niggas for their work, and don't feel wrong about that shit
You a pussy ass nigga, you don't belong with no bricks
I pop pills, I feel good, I mix Patron with the shit

[Hook]
In the club, going hard, niggas know I got them racks
In the kitchen, whipping hard, niggas know I got that sack
In this bitch, going hard, niggas know I got them racks
In the kitchen, whipping hard, niggas know I got that sack

[Verse 2]
Niggas standing on the couch and throwing signs in the club
V.I.P. bitch, I don't wait in line at the lub
It's a photo shoot, fans taking pictures in this bitch
I'm a nice guy, buying bitches liquor in this bitch
Got my fam' with me, brought my nigga Scrilla in this bitch
I don't give a fuck, I'm back on my Ridgecrest shit
Yelling thug life, niggas on that 2Pac shit
Minnesota Twins, bitch I'm on my two Glock shit
You niggas screwed up, put you on your news box shit
By the fam', by the river, finna' see many bricks
Uh, she nasty, she just had a semen dish
Suck the skin of a dick, you should've seen this bitch
They say I'm nasty, I think imma' clean this bitch
Shorty suck it so good, might try to clean this bitch, sike
She not the type, to be a wife
She get a pass, just for the night

[Hook]
