Dope boy nigga, like I'm from Detroit
Young ratchet nigga from North Memphis, the street port

Kingpin shit, nigga, cocaine cowboys

[Bridge]
I'mma cocaine cowboy (I am)
I'mma cocaine cowboy
I import, export
I'mma cocaine cowboy

[Verse 1]
Moved to Miami to get close to tha plug.(I did)
Everybody know Yo Gotti sell drugs
Brand new Phantom, ain't sold no records
He a dopeboy that's why the streets respect us
Fuck a rap nigga they ain't touched no bricks(fuck em)
Rapping bout this work and they ain't done shit(pussy)
Clown ass niggas should get ran off tha block
Yeen neva drawed down and hit a nig' witcha Glock
Yeen neva got a block an broke that bitch out tha wrapper
So quit sayin' you a dope boy, you just a rapper
Niggas playin' with this game, like it's a muhfuckin joke
This my muhfuckin' code, i give tha streets niggas hope

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Let me clear up tha rumors, let me talk to the streets
All that publicity shit homes, that ain't no beef
Niggas killing in Memphis, head shots off the muscle
If u fucked bout the bitch, yo fault, u should neva cuffed 'er
One thing I learned from my brother, real killers don't talk
Gotta know how to move and I think like a boss
I spit the shit that I live, this the shit I was taught
This the shit I'mma die about, foreign cars doin drive-by's
Imma real nigga and I'm gone stead
Miss me with that fuck shit cause I 'on't play it
Young niggas with me, terrorists, code red
They tryna trick me off the streets so I can go fed

[Hook]
