I Just called ta the city..

Plus I got the feeling some pussy ass rappers gonna try to play me
And the record label might not try to pay me
But fuck it, I'm a spazz out, spazz out
I think I'm a spazz out, spazz out!

[Verse 2:]
I just talked to my homie, said he ain't assed out
He got a chopper, and I know he's about to spazz out

A brand new beamer, a brand new phone and nigga cashed out
And if I have to shoot a nigga, I'm just gon bail out
Kick up my feet, watch bet and kush my self out

[Verse 4:]
Hold on, stop the beat, cut me up
Make sure niggas hear me clear
This is my acceptance speech!
I'm the gangsta of the year
Thanks the soda, thank the kitchen
Thanks the friends that show me love
Thanks the trap before I leave the stage, I must salute the plug
Thank the streets, thank every nigga that ever doubted me...
Thanks to beef kept me on my toes like I 'oughta be
Look at me balling now, right here I'm supposed to be
Feds won't trap a nigga, hit me with conspiracy
Fuck it, do your job then
Broke, I'm a rob then
I need organized crime, we're a mob, then!
Bring the streets back like some hard then
This shit is real life, so I'm a put my heart in!
Gangsta of the year
Realest nigga of all time
Streets cast ya votes
