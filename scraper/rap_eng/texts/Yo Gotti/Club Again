[Intro: Damar Jackson]
How the fuck you let another nigga see you naked?
How the fuck you let another nigga see you naked?
How the fuck you let another nigga see you naked?
How the fuck you let another nigga see you naked?

[Chorus: Damar Jackson]
Now I'm back up in the club again, yeah
Now I'm back on these drugs again, yeah
I told myself I'd never cuff again, yeah
I can't be the one suffering

[Verse 1: Damar Jackson]
I just broke up with my girlfriend
And she just broke up with her boyfriend
She said she pretty much done with men
'Til we took a shot and started talkin', aw
Now she wide open, I'm in go mode
Came with my niggas, never solo
So when it's time to leave, girl come with me
What's your number girl, what's your IG? aw yeah

[Chorus: Damar Jackson]
Now I'm back up in the club again, yeah
Now I'm back on these drugs again, yeah
I told myself I'd never cuff again, yeah
I can't be the one suffering

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I can't see myself selling drugs again (yeah)
I can't see myself falling in love again (yeah)
My lil homie ran off on the plug again (plug again, my lil homie)
Magic City, I'm fucking up the club again (woo, again)
I just want to win and she just want to do some' different but I'm still the same nigga
You don't like it, get a lame nigga
I don't trust these bitches anyway
She like tell the truth, I ain't got shit to say (quiet)
Street nigga, yeah it been that way (yup)
I need a real bitch and it gon' stay that way
These bitches ain't loyal (loyal)
Always want a nigga spoil
I've been tryin' best to avoid you (avoid you)
Hit the end button, I ignored you ('nored you)
You on my phone again (again)
You in my home again ('gain)
Won't leave me alone again ('gain)
God don't like ugly but you know I'm known to sin
So I did you wrong (I am), again

[Chorus: Damar Jackson]
Now I'm back up in the club again, yeah
Now I'm back on these drugs again, yeah
I told myself I'd never cuff again, yeah
I can't be the one suffering

[Verse 3: Damar Jackson]
Aw yeah, now my ex wanna fuck again, yeah
Blocked the bitch then I blocked her friend, yeah
Niggas in the clubs sponsoring
I ain't even given compliments, nah, nah
You on the side like some condiments
But I still squeeze that ass with confidence
If you really want it, meet me in the lobby
Good sex, girl you know I got it
Please forgive me, I'm 'bout to catch a body, lord

[Chorus: Damar Jackson]
Now I'm back up in the club again, yeah
Now I'm back on these drugs again, yeah
I told myself I'd never cuff again, yeah
I can't be the one suffering
