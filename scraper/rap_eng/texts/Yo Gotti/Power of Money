[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I heard it's over for trap niggas, word to these rap niggas
Word to the internet, I've never been into that
I know niggas doing life sentences, some of 'em innocent (for real)
But they'll never tell on they man, where them niggas at?
Who came through in that drop heavy before the deal? Me
Who bought himself out of his contract for half a mil? Me
Who kept the streets alive? Me, who put his niggas on? Me
Who rode with you right or wrong? Me, and repped the streets in every song
I know Young when Meech was free, talk to Meek before DC
I dodged a life sentence, niggas so can't shit discourage me
Get me a big ol bag of money if you trying to encourage me
They say it cost to be the boss well you say I paid the fee, nigga

[Hook: INK  & Yo Gotti]
I want the money nigga, yeah yeah (I do)
I want the power nigga, yeah yeah (- Do)
Hustle every hour nigga, yeah yeah (I am)

I want the money nigga, yeah yeah

Hustle every hour nigga, yeah yeah (I do)
Do you see 'em doing it like this nigga no no?

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Walk in the studio and enter the booth, talk to the microphone (mic check)
Tell 'em about your life and about the shit you be standin' on (I am)
How you put your niggas up (I did), how you fucked a thousand bitches (true)
But you never leaving home (I can't do it)
Bitches is bitches and family is family, for real
Rappin' was cool but dope what was payin' the bills
Friends they hate, they frenemies, they're not your enemies
They really do like you, they hate, just envious energy
You know the power of money, the power of fame
Bitches fuck on a nigga (for real), knowin' he lame
Damn to say it ain't personal for the shoes and the purses
It's like we said in the verse, the money ain't worth it, I can't do it

[Hook: INK  & Yo Gotti]
I want the money nigga, yeah yeah (I can do it)
I want the power nigga, yeah yeah (Fo' real)

Do you see 'em doing it like this nigga, no no?
I want the money nigga, yeah yeah (I do)
I want the power nigga, yeah yeah (I do)
Hustle every hour nigga, yeah yeah (I am)
Do you see 'em doing it like this nigga no no?
