It's World War Three, nigga, fucking with me, nigga, my niggers' with it
With it, I&E, nigga, World War Three, nigga, fucking with me, nigga
My niggers' with it, with it, WB, bitch

[Verse 1]
It's World War Three, nigga, fucking wit Gotti, boy
I'm about to separate your soul from your body, boy, I've got that chopper boy
Coming through your block, boy and you can't stop us, boy
Better call the coppers', boy, my niggers' with it, with it, money, we get it
Get it, I see my target, regardless I hit it, hit it, bullets ain't got no name
Gotti ain't playing games, Gotti don't buss in the crowd, I see my mane in aim
Situations don't matter, put your head on a platter, catch the cut
Then, bitch, I shed, born, and rattle, got on your head, feel you ready
Got on yo best, you say you're beefing with Gotti, you living, then you blessed

[Bridge] x2
Fuck an institution, bitch, this a revolution, I ain't gon' chill
Until I get an execution

[Hook]
It's World War Three, nigga, fucking with me, nigga, my niggers' with it
With it, I&E, nigga, World War Three, nigga, fucking with me, nigga
My niggers' with it, with it, WB, bitch

[Verse 2]
So you say you want to break the law, what about when I break your jaw
What about when I come through your hood, sideways in a Regal
Me and my people, stunting wit a sawed off, I say you want to think
Before you do that, you don't really want to see me run through that
I'm screaming out Gotti, before I got him so why you screaming 'Who's that'
You say you want to wild out but you don't want to foul out
What the fuck you thinking about, see you fucking with a block burner
When shit gets hot, it melts, ain't no telling how it turn out
I'm bringing fame to the streets in a proper way, represent I&E
Each and every day, Yo Gotti, motherfucker, what the fuck you say
My grill ain't real, my shit don't shine in your face
How many niggers' had six figures besides Jigga, before the rap game came
Me and my niggers', representin' down south with - up in our mouth
Shit, bricks and chips is what I'm all about, say it again, rewind the shit
Play it again, record again because you're fucking wit a nigga, bring war again

[Hook]
It's World War Three, nigga, fucking with me, nigga, my niggers' with it
With it, I&E, nigga, World War Three, nigga, fucking with me, nigga
My niggers' with it, with it, WB, bitch

[Verse 3]
I scream attention, if you're an I&E solider, pay attention
Because it's some serious shit I'm about to mention, go and get that nigga
So I can lynch him, don't ever join my team and try to exit
That's like having a Lexus and won't flex it
I know you like the ice up in my bracelet
You had the advantage, now you can't do nothing but panic like a hoe
Wanting it rough but you're too romantic, I'm the number one writer
Who say that their tighter, that's just like bringing a fight up
Out of a fighter, trick, I'm ready for it, never annoyed, so energetic
And with that slick shit you pull, you make me feel disrespected
It's World War Three, nigga, fucking with Gotti, boy, I ain't no studio gangster
I bring the drama boy

[Hook]
It's World War Three, nigga, fucking with me, nigga, my niggers' with it
With it, I&E, nigga, World War Three, nigga, fucking with me, nigga
My niggers' with it, with it, WB, bitch
