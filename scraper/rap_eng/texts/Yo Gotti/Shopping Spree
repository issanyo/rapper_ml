[Chorus]
Left ring 10 hundred cash
Neck piece 30 grand
Whip cost 300 grand
God damn I'm on a shopping spree
Bracelet 20 bags
Rims cost me 5 grand
House cost 500 cash
God damn I'm on a shopping spree

[Soulja Boy]
Lying in a whip that don't release until 2010
50 thousand dollars spent just to make my rims spin
Half a million dollars spent on the house I live in
Even more spent on the seat I sit my ass in
Soulja boy tell em a.k.a the assassin
Prises cuts in my watch like I threw sum glass in
Damn exclusive shit sent from china
If you looking for me I'm probably in yo girls vagina
I'm looking in the mirror tell me who's finer
Bought a Lamborghini didn't need to cosigner
Hey what I spit is just minor
Every cut served soulja boys headliner
Damn now tell me you don't feel this
Hey you can't say I'm just one hit
Hey are you bitch niggas serious
I'm quick on track like fast and the furious

[Chorus]
I'm on a shopping spree [Repeat: x6]

[Gucci Mane]
Chevy to a Chevy Chevy to a Lamborghini
You can't be me or see me unless you see me on t.v
Shine and greezy I wonder Stevie Wonder can see me
Necklace a jungle of greed just check my selectional pieces
I got a stupid collection you see
Chain worth a millie you sill wille a millie and 20
Uh man I pass out 50s an 20s
I pass out 50s an 20s I pass out 100s and 50s
We make more money than chemist, doctors, the lawyers, the dentist
Chemist the doctors the lawyers ye money together couldn't getcha
2 door Gurraro 160
Drop top 120
House worth a million and three dual trust 63 G's
Old schools a hundred a piece
That cost me 75 gs, 65 actually but my rims coast me ten of them things
Gucci yo gotti the king
Soulja done did it again
This team be 82gs that be worth 82 keys

[Chorus]
[Yo Gotti]
Money ain't the option
Lets give you a option
You go to your stash partner an I'll come out my pockets
2 hundred hundreds
That like 20 grad
Just enough for me to buy my briden a new band
I'm like soulja boy tell me
They think that I'm playing
Come down her to Tennessee and see that I'm the man
Ain't talking bout no rapping
I'm talking bout that trapping
I'm talking bout that brick ill ram it straight up pistol package?
Ring piece 2000 grand
Neck piece 4000 grand
Fina cop Chevy but instead I went and coped a lamb
Whoa took yo bitch on a shopping spree
Gucci then Prada an I think they hoe in love with
Ain't got security I keep lots of thugs wit me
We call them goons cause I rock lots of jewelery
Cocaine everything
Who the fuck ain't feeling me
Gun powder on the market
Realest nigga in the streets

[Chorus]
I'm on a shopping spree [Repeat: x6]
