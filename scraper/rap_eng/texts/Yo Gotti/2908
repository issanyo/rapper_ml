[Intro]
Yeah
I gotta take 'em back to the 'Crest man
That's where all this shit started at, you namsayin
Stop sign shit, nahmean
Hallway shit
Dice games, nigga lose it all

[Chorus]
2908 apartment 4, I remember
We were trappin' in and out the door, I remember
Miss Shirley's house breakin' down them things, I remember
I used to serve my partner momma, she's a crack fiend
Damn I remember
I remember

I ain't know no better my nigga, I apologize for that
Damn

[Verse 1]
I wanna apologize homie
I ain't realize homie
I had that hustler instinct
Everything we monetize, homie
Your little brother like my brother
It left him traumatized, homie
And you my nigga
You were down to do a homicide for me
It's that hood shit
We was on Woodcliff with them choppas
OCU and undercover narcos tryin' to stop us
Signed my first deal, focus did some good
Still, I put 100,000 worth of guns in the hood, I remember

They couldn't tell us shit nigga
We were ready to go to war with whoever
That's when we came up with Ridgecrest Afghanistans

[Chorus]
2908 apartment 4, I remember
We were trappin' in and out the door, I remember
Miss Shirley's house breakin' down them things, I remember
I used to serve my partner momma, she's a crack fiend
Damn I remember

[Verse 2]
Fiends lined up at the dope house
Used to have money, now you broke now
I used to write my raps in a dope house
Used to laugh at me, ain't a joke now

[Hook]
Dope, Dope house
I remember, I remember
Dope, Dope house
I remember, I remember
Dope house
Yeah I remember them days, I remember
Yeah I remember them days, I remember

[Verse 3]
I caught my first charge on Shady Vista
Same street I shot my first pistol
Big G, damn I miss you nigga
Lil' Tweety, damn we miss you nigga
Look at me, we never envisioned this
If I crossed you on the way I never intended it
If I rob you I did it purposely
Still thinkin' 'bout niggas murkin' me
Dirty money we washed that shit in the laundromat
We were trappin' on the [?] bought a hundred MACs
You shot at us, you know we shot back
I'm from Ridgecrest, they say I don't know how to act
I apologize
Not for my actions, I was trappin'
I was tryin' to feed my family before I was rappin'
My first charge attempted murder and kidnapping
Now he sorry ask the victim what had happened

[Chorus]
2908 apartment 4, I remember
We were trappin' in and out the dope, I remember
Miss Shirley's house breakin' down them things, I remember
I used to serve my partner momma, she's a crack fiend
Damn I remember

[Hook]
Dope house
I remember, I remember
Dope, Dope house
I remember, I remember
Dope house
Yeah I remember them days, I remember
Yeah I remember them days, I remember

[Verse 4]
I got keys to the city
Wanna know a secret
I had keys in the city before the keys to the city
So how the fuck the landlord think he gon' ban me
Fell out with real hittas from the hood, niggas couldn't ban me
'Cause my only plan b is death before I be a pussy
And throw this shit away before I let a nigga push me
Extort who? I wish you niggas knew
I ain't even fuckin' with you if you need to check to shoot
Ha, and take a chain from who?
Thirty million dollar, niggas just got something to prove
And if they mob they mob and that's what it was
But I watched these young niggas grow up, that's why it's love

[Chorus]
2908 apartment 4, I remember
We were trappin' in and out the door, I remember
Miss Shirley's house breakin' down them things, I remember
I used to serve my partner momma, she's a crack fiend
Damn I remember
