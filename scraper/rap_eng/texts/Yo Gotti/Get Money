Bad bitch, and she do it for nothing
Shake her ass, then she count up the 1s
Bossed up aditude, that's how she come
Let you know she workin with funds
She fuck a lot, but she ain’t lookin for love
She in the streets, wanna fuck with a thug
Keep her motivated, show her love
Grab her hair when I give her a hug
She keep them brok hoes hatin on her, see her turn up, she don't give a fuck
They know she a hustler, and if she get fucked up, she staying down till she run it up
No conversation, she talk bout what she chose
I get some paper, she get some paper
She be ?
Pop a perk before she go to work
Feelin nervous, then it make her twirk
At the club on a Friday to Sunday, you might catch a ? at chearch
All she know is get cash

She from the good part of Memphis
I was probably somewhere in the trentches
I was probably somewhere tryna get it
Til this year I ain't know she existed
When I met her she was like I keep it real
I know it come with the life you live
I got a bitch, she be making trips
Say she loyal long as I keep it real
Turn dollars to red bottom heals
Off of twirkin she bought her a Berkin bag
Turned me down the first night, she didn’t let me smash
I was like, cool, and respected that
That don't make you no wife
She like, what you or not, I'm like, ait
II'm on ? taking flights
Shauty bossed up like me, she my type
Put her hands on her knees, and go run up that cheese
Her nose in the air, and them diamonds on freeze

A boss in her conrner, all she really need
