[Intro: Future]
Aye, FreeBand Gang
CMG
You can have whatever you want
You hear me, Aye (Turn Up!)
Turn down for what?

[Hook: Future]
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Fish scale, I’ll buy you what you want
Thousand bales, buy you what you want
A hundred squares, I’ll buy you what you want
Send it through the air, and buy you what you want

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I got plug money, gotta ship it back in Mexico
Slot money make you shoot yourself like plexico
Blood money, you fuck ‘round, be the next to go
Oil money, I got tanks of gas like Texaco
Drug money, bitch, I’m running out of head spot
Shoe money, I had a hundred in a Nike box
Ho money, I took my bitch to ball in harbor
Watch money, what’s a forty for a starter
In Mexico they’re growing weed in the back yard
In Mexico get a pound, a couple one hundred, dawg
Exotic money, now I be riding in exotic cars
Switch my flow up just like future, now I got exotic bars

[Hook: Future]
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Fish scale, I’ll buy you what you want
Thousand bales, buy you what you want
A hundred squares, I’ll buy you what you want
Send it through the air, and buy you what you want

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I got brick money, nine hundred for an ounce of yay
Streets dry, so nine hundred what they got to pay
Got a fifty in, got another fifty on the way
In magic city let the city know it’s time to play
White whip, stainless steel, bitch, 300K
I ain’t gotta rap, trap jumping I can stop today
Columbia, Columbians, I got ‘em on the way
Lawyer paid more money if I get popped today
In Mexico my girl plugged when I was 16
In Mexico I was getting ‘em for the 16
That’s a lot of money, now I’m riding in exotic cars
Switched my flow up, changed my future, now I got exotic cars

[Hook: Future]
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Fish scale, I’ll buy you what you want
Thousand bales, buy you what you want
A hundred square, I’ll buy you what you want
Send it through the air, and buy you what you want
