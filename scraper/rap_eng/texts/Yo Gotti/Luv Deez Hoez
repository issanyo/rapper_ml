[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Okay, my bitch is a winner
Met the bitch in December
Real name was Keisha
Nickname was Criminal
Got a red bitch named July
Head fine, fireworks
Pussy special, head amazing
Looking for her, high alert
I'm a street nigga, one hunnid
And I love all of my bitches
I'mma get money, go hard
And ball all out with my bitches
I love thick hoes, light hoes
Black bitches, white hoes
Mixed bitches, ratchet hoes
Bougie bitches can't fuck with those
I like true freaks, chi hoes
I get money but don't buy hoes
That ass fat, gap wide
She can't stand straight she look pigeon toed
I fucked Tonya sister, Meeka cousin
Her best friend and her roommate
With y'all BFF y'all can tag team
And we call that shit a double date

[Refrain Yo Gotti]
When that ass is fat and the head on point
I love deez hoes
When the bitch wake up go to work make dough
I love deez hoes
When the bitch hit the club bring a friend home with her
I love deez hoes, I love deez hoes
She fell in love with a gangsta, she a gangsta hoe

[Hook: Yo Gotti & 2 Chainz]
Oh, I love deez hoes

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I love bad bitches is the problem
She gon' suck my dick until tomorrow
Spondivits eating calamari
I pay all the bills baby momma ain't worried
I'll fuck you bitch in a movie
Hardcore all on her booty
Rolex all on the old wrist
Her skirt going up on a Tuesday
Bitch just started in a chevy
Tryna do it big till I'm wealthy
Got a bookbag full of money
In the dealership take a selfie
All I used to whip was a Mazda
I used to have to pray for a thousand
Just bought a four floor house
Just to use the bitch for a closet
Love all them hoes then I move on
See my old neighborhood when the news on
Leave the club and head straight to the fucking crib
Till I fuck her on the futon

[Hook: Yo Gotti & 2 Chainz]
Oh, I love deez hoes
Love deez hoes
I love deez hoes
Oh, I love deez hoes
Love deez hoes
I love deez hoes

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
I fell in love, first sight
Virgin pussy, super tight
She kinda insecure so she hold me tight
Attitude and one I kinda like
She be talking shit, like to fight
Last nigga ain't treat her right
So the last nigga ain't in her life
She listen to me so I give advice
I said, "you look good, that don't make you bad"
What's your greatest goal?
Who you fucked in the past?
What your future is?
What your plans are?
And most important now what you stand for?
A real nigga what you need to be planning for
Get money what you need a man for?
These lame ass niggas understand bruh
That ain't yo bitch if you paying her
A real nigga what you need to be planning for
Get money what you need a man for?
These lame ass niggas understand bruh
That ain't yo bitch if you paying her

[Hook: Yo Gotti & 2 Chainz]
Oh, I love deez hoes

I love deez hoes
Oh, I love deez hoes
Love deez hoes
I love deez hoes
