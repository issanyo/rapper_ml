Dis fa my niggas who felt like (giving up)
I feel ya pain nigga, I felt da same nigga
See a nigga like me come straight from hard times nigga ain't shit changed
Was fucked up
Workin with a 8ball
Mama stressed out nigga back against the walk
Rent time up can't be late again
Mama hidin out tryin dodge the repo man
Food stamps out
Light man outside
Phone cut off and air unit just died(Damn)
Mane it hard tryin fight dis
Down on my knees askin GOD why it's like dis
Fuck dat Gotti ain't havin dat
A nigga fronted me a brick told myself

Fuck 'em I'll kill 'em if he want beef
Ion give a fuck my family folks must eat

Niggas rob niggas kill niggas serve dey own muthers
But not me kuz iI was family raised
Got dat family loyalty I got my family paid
Memba back in da days you wore ya family J's
Auntie dun ya braids and uncle cut ya fade
Kool-aid and soul-food is all dats made fa ya
Wanted to give up but ya family folks prayed fa ya
