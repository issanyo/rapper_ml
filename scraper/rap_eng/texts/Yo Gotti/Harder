[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Ok the beat go hard but I go harder
I can die a drug dealer, but im smarter
Pair of forgiato rims I could of bought a charger
But dem bitches make the lambo look a little more harder
King of my city north memphis we’re like Harlem
Blood gang crips too we gon' eat regardless
See me on the news ,yeah I beat dem charges
All them young dudes were runnin,duckin, had em dodging
Blood shed, my niggas in the fed
My nigga Gucci die I can't let nuthing slide
Ridgecrest where I resign Ridgecrest what I provide
Young nigga with them choppas ‘cause I know they gonna ride
Fuck if I die today I went to church I pay my tax
I leave my son a couple million dollars so I did alright
Harder, ain’t no nigga in this streets that built like me sold bricks like me
Mexico, took trips like me
Texaco ain't nothing but gas
Thou shoot, thou shall not pass
I break bread so no fuck me nigga i’m a real nigga and I was built to last

[Hook]
Hard hard i’m hard hard hard i’m hard
Hard hard i’m hard
In the kitchen I whip it harder
Top drop riding harder
Hard hard i’m hard hard hard i’m hard
In the kitchen I Whip it harder
Real nigga I live harder
Hard hard i’m hard

[Verse 2: Yo gotti]
The streets go hard but I go harder
I know what Diddy meant mo money mo fucking problems
I know young money like im dwayne carter
Remember my life a real nigga if I die tomorrow
I’m harder met a bitch in the mazda
Put the bitch in the range rover
Cause she suck dick till tomorrow
Every 24 hours, 24 brick of powder
24s on my Panamere,50k on the chandelier
House look like a castle,  bitch white like alaska
Got instrumentals, sold all white, on my mercedes shit nasa
Pulled off in that 'rari took off like im nasa
Nigga playing dem games with me she’ll fuck you if you answer
She smarter better get she harder better yet you pussy
Then why them bitches charge ya'

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Strip moneys strip moneys got on my wall
I’m going so hard I know I got more than dough
Got the beamer the bentley triple-black Mercedes-benz
Got me 5 mill in cash time to get it again
From reebok to Ciroc came a long way from the blocks
Baby girl all wet cause shit i've driven it rocks
Licking shots that you pussies my stock fresh shot through the roof
As I shoot for the stars im shooting buying a coup
I know I won't live forever but stocking up like I will
I know you niggas ain’t real but I fuck you like u is
48 laws 36 hoes 57 nets all black tip-toeing
26 inch rims chrome mac 11 doing right so hard but I pray I get to heaven

[Hook:]
