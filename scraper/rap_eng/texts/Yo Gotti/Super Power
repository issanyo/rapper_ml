[Hook]
Hoppin' out the Porsche, horsepower
I got it off the boat, plug power
Baking soda, fork and water, cookin' power
I'm a trap hero, superpowers
I got gun money, gun power
I got bond money, super power
I got get-your-home money, stupid power
When you a real nigga, you got super powers

[Verse 1]
I don't play no games, I can finish these cowards
Mortal Kombat, I got finish him powers
Fuckin' with the plug, I got feed you powers
I'm a real nigga, I can read you cowards
When you can see a lame, you got see through powers
When you're 1000 you don't need no vouchers
I be in the club like fuck these couches
Got them pistols in the club, we don't need no bouncers
Bottles on the way, nigga, power up
The bad hoes with us, nigga, we powered up
Them foreigns outside, nigga, we mounted up
That pussy nigga panicked on me, he hit the button

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Bag, super, swag, stupid
Whip, roofless, foreigns, coupeish
The hood, I do this, good, we super
Head, super, my bitch, exclusive
I rock Balenciagas, boy that's super swag
Supercharge a Rover, it go super fast
I mix Xannys with the D'usse, that's a super glass
Off that California Kush, yeah that's that super gas
Got her turnt up on the Gram, oh she super gassed
But I don't want the number, shawty, I'ma pass
It's paper in these streets and I'm the superglue
When all your partners real you got a super crew

[Hook (partial)]
Hoppin' out the Porsche, horsepower
I got it off the boat, plug power
Baking soda, fork and water, cookin' power
I'm a trap hero, superpowers

[Bridge] x2
Pussy, power
Bottles, power
Plug, power
Haters, sour
