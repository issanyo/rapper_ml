[Verse 1: B.o.B]
She was already on deck 'fore I ever met her
Young Bob in the buildin', lookin' like Hugh Hefner on these heifers
Man I swear somebody better tell her
I don’t care what’s on your mind, I just want your cerebellum
Yeah, but my team stay down through the stormy weather
Back when we was hustlin' and nobody would help us
Now we poppin' bottles man, now we top shelfers
We just knew that we would make it man, nobody could tell us nothin' better
Nothin' a fortune teller couldn’t tell us
As a young'n I never really cared for Christmas carols
Now when you see my apparel, I got several different levels
Look at my wrist, bitch, it’s levels to these bezels
This whip is mine but I drive it like I stole it
Flyin' down the interstate, lightin' up a stougin'
Hustle Gang on that mob shit, bring me my canollis
Beatin' up the bars, call me Oscar De La Hoya

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
I had one, two, three too many, I’m fucked up, four chicks with me
I’m loud, took about five shots, six bottles I just copped
Twisted, turnt up, 24/7, that's more bad bitches I’m gettin'
They know I hit 'em and quit 'em and go past what they came here for
Baby, can I see you make yo ass drop?
I’ma let the Rose bottles pop
I’ma sip this 'Roc, baby don’t stop
'Cause yo body on fire, you too hot

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
I can’t feel my face
I’m so numb, I’m so wasted
So dumb, I’m shit faceded
Just in case I don’t make it

[Hook: August Alsina]
Take my drink, nigga I’m buzzin'
Take my trees, nigga I’m gone
Take my keys, nigga it’s nothin'
One of these chicks is takin' me home
Take my drink, nigga I’m buzzin'
Take my trees, nigga I’m gone
Take my keys, nigga it’s nothin'
One of these chicks is takin' me home

[Verse 3: August Alsina]
That little red bone said she’s takin' me home, fine ass friend said she comin' along
Love in the morn', so I’m fuckin' 'em strong, I’ma beat 'em to sleep then I’m gone in the mornin'
Hold up, I tell a bitch roll up, before I gotta roll out, all I do is turn up
Turn down for what, need another drink, baby, go and pour up, money hungover
So you know I gotta throw up the 'fetti so that they know that I’m ready
To get 'em poppin' and droppin', the party never be stoppin'
'Cause I be keepin' 'em rockin' and all these bitches be choosin'
'Cause now they see that I’m winnin' like I’m allergic to losin' and I

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
I can’t feel my face
I’m so numb, I’m so wasted
So dumb, I’m shit faceded
Just in case I don’t make it

[Hook: August Alsina]
Take my drink, nigga I’m buzzin'
Take my trees, nigga I’m gone
Take my keys, nigga it’s nothin'
One of these chicks is takin' me home
Take my drink, nigga I’m buzzin'
Take my trees, nigga I’m gone
Take my keys, nigga it’s nothin'
One of these chicks is takin' me home

[Verse 4: Yo Gotti]
Get high off the money, nigga, yeah I made it
Just count a mil', nigga, now I’m faded
Number one stunna boy, I feel like Baby
Shout out to the hood 'cause that’s who raised me
Hunnid bands in my pocket boy, that’s that kush
And shawty wanna fuck, she gave me that look
Hustler of the year, know every rule in the book
Pull up in the 'Rari, boy, that's all it took
That’s a white out, it’s a night out
Puttin' money on the bar there just to bring the light out
I just wanna see your fireworks
Fifty bottles, that’s slight work, I’m in the club, turn up

[Hook: August Alsina]
Take my drink, nigga I’m buzzin'
Take my trees, nigga I’m gone
Take my keys, nigga it’s nothin'
One of these chicks is takin' me home
Take my drink, nigga I’m buzzin'
Take my trees, nigga I’m gone
Take my keys, nigga it’s nothin'
One of these chicks is takin' me home

[Outro: August Alsina]
