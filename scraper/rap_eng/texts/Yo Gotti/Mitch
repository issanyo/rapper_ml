[Intro]
Man when I was a broke nigga I used to be like. When I get my money on, I'ma spend it on this, I'ma spend it on that. I always knew I was gonna get some money so I looked at it like practice. Like I was just getting ready for the bag, you know what I'm saying? Pratice you feel me

[Hook]
I'm money making Mitch, I need a money making bitch
I spent 200 on the kit, 1500 on the kicks
I'm money making Mitch, I need a money making bitch
I spent 200 on the kit, 1500 on the kicks
Look I just hit a lick, spend 250 on the whip
Another 50 on a trip just to fuck your bitch nigga
Just got a check, that bitch got 2, 3, commas
Look like an out of town number
I'm going hard for 2, 3, summers
I'm money making Mitch, I need a money making bitch
I spent 200 on the kit, 1500 on the kicks

[Verse 1]
Margiela king nigga, Balenciaga don nigga
I'm on my Blac Youngsta bitch when I'm young nigga
I'm money making Mitch, Ace Boogie with the bricks
I'm Calvin with the hits, I'll come and take a nigga shit
Signed Blac Youngsta on a jet then I took him to the 'jects
Then I gave the nigga a Lambo just to show him he was next
I'm charging 80 for the 100 pack, 70 if you run it back
60 if you triple that, if I say nickel that's a 50 pack
I can talk dope all day, I can count money all day
You can fuck hoes all day, I'ma count it while y'all play

[Verse 2]
I'm money making Mitch, I need a money making bitch
Need her ass hella thick, need her hair always fixed
Like my bitch's hips hella wide
Tell 'em fuck a dime we don't do the gym
Tell my niggas just keep it quiet, no back and forth gon' go and see him
Niggas in the fed, niggas dead before I be a pussy before I go and join 'em
Niggas acting tough on the internet, somebody better go inform them

[Verse 3]
That I'm money making mitch, I got a whole lotta sticks
And I'm really with the shit, yeah I'm really with the shit
I'm with the shit, with the shit
I just copped the Wraith out the dealership
I just the stones in the Rolex
I fucked on your sister, your ho next
I look like the money, that's no flex
I made a million off snow flakes
I don't slow down in no time
I be on gas with no brakes
I be on gas with no brakes
I be on cash and no hate
I be on masks with AKs
And I'ma pull up if you don't pay

[Verse 4]
Cause I'm money making Mitch, I want 30 for a brick
I want 100 for a show and I ain't got nothing for a bitch
I ain't riding no more purses, I ain't do no more verses
I ain't fucking with these niggas, have way more crosses than the churches
The doctors are the plugs and the trappers are the nurses
Is everybody popping pain killers? Is everybody hurting?
Perc, Zan, Perc, Zan, Perc, Zan, does everybody got anxiety?
Trap house got variety, fuck wrong with society?
I'm money making Mitch, I need a money making bitch
I got a 30 in my clip and I'ma hit you off the rip
