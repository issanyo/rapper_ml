[Chorus]
I gotta quit fucking with you

Damn, homie, all the shit that we done been through
I gotta quit fucking with you
Gun jam, say the motherfucker wouldn't shoot (alright)
I gotta quit fucking with you
You, I gotta quit fucking with you
You, I gotta quit fucking with you
You were my main bitch and I loved you, too
Biggest ho in the city, gotta quit fucking with you
I gotta quit fucking with you

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you a story about this bitch I had
Used to buy this bitch all types of bags
Lil bad bitch, kept me on my swag shit
Went to school to be a stylist, bitch kinda act a lil childish
My main bitch, I think I like this ho
What the fuck was wrong with me? Thinking I can wife this ho
Lets put it like this, she on the money team
Every rapper, every trapper, any athlete
I gotta quit fucking with you
Every nigga in the city be fucking with you
Lil lying bitch, always on that crying shit
Fine bitch, cute face, you a think she so innocent
Yeah, she's innocent, she into me, we intimate
We be fucking instantly, got head game consistency
Consistency, she fucked my head up mentally
Got head in that new Bentley, I thought this bitch was into me

[Chorus]
I gotta quit fucking with you
I gotta quit fucking with you
Damn, homie, all the shit that we done been through
I gotta quit fucking with you
Gun jam, say the motherfucker wouldn't shoot (alright)
I gotta quit fucking with you
You, I gotta quit fucking with you
You, I gotta quit fucking with you
You were my main bitch and I loved you, too
Biggest ho in the city, gotta quit fucking with you

[Verse 2]
My home boy, ride or die
Brick coppa, pistol poppa, we stay in the sky
Sunday night, fell in the club
Know them pistols on deck, so you know what it was
Enemy in this bitch, we laughing on chill
You know once he leave the club we posted to kill
Gun jam, homie for real
Took his strap straight out the whip and unloaded the clip
Itâ€™s war time, you know what it do
Fuck you ain't know, I gotta quit fucking with you
Homeboy in the fed, a hundred twenty months (ten)
He be down by three, get out a couple months

[Chorus]
I gotta quit fucking with you
I can read between the lines, I know what it do
He telling something, and I'm telling 'em too
Let the streets know, they gotta quit fucking with you
I gotta quit fucking with you
I gotta quit fucking with you
Damn, homie, all the shit that we done been through
I gotta quit fucking with you
Gun jam, say the motherfucker wouldn't shoot (alright)
I gotta quit fucking with you
You, I gotta quit fucking with you
You, I gotta quit fucking with you
You were my main bitch and I loved you, too
Biggest ho in the city, gotta quit fucking with you
I gotta quit fucking with you
I gotta quit fucking with you
