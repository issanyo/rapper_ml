This is a motherfucking stickup right now
Bang bang pow pow!

Lay it down, lay it down
Pussy nigga lay it down, lay it down

Bang bang pow pow!

My nigga Boo from Milwaukee, this girl drove him crazy
Made him run in the bank, he should've join the navy
A high speed chase, that nigga barely made it
He was full of that, boy, so he was hella faded
It be niggas like Boo who be the real soldiers
Good niggas at heart, the gang fuck 'em over
And I ain't spoke with my nigga Boo in a minute
So if you listening, Boo, you still a lieutenant, 'we win it
Yeah, lay it down, lay it down
My first robbery 100 pounds on the ground
Don't make a move, don't make a sound
And I don't want it late, I want it now, pussy

Lay it down, lay it down
Get low, lay it down, lay it down
This is a motherfucking stickup right now
Bang bang pow pow!

Lay it down, lay it down
Pussy nigga lay it down, lay it down
This is a motherfucking stickup going down
Bang bang pow pow!

We the shit, nigga
November 10th, 2003, 10 PM, four niggas with masks and they looking for me
My gal ducked, but I wasn't
The dope flew in, they started busting
Damn, phone dropped, then my heart, too
And I could hear 'em scream as they argued
Bitch, where that money? Where your nigga at?
Wish I could tell I'm on my way, running lights and all
I kill these niggas, man, I swear to Lord
Nigga took a hand of brick but missed a hundred large
'remember that any nigga play with me gonna get it bad, pussy
Lay it down, lay it down
Remember what goes around comes around, yeah
Respect the game cause I'm in it
I don't want revenge later, I want it now

Lay it down, lay it down
Get low, lay it down, lay it down
This is a motherfucking stickup right now
Bang bang pow pow!

Lay it down, lay it down
Pussy nigga lay it down, lay it down
This is a motherfucking stickup going down
Bang bang pow pow!
