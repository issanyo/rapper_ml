[Intro: Young Jeezy]
Mike Will on the beat you know I'm killin' this shit
Just left the 'sace store you know I'm killin' this fit
Yeah we get the broke knob bro, ain't tryna to get fixed
It's the remix killer, yeah I'll kill ya remix
Whassup!

[Hook: B.o.B]
I'm in my zone I'm feeling it
Stop blowing my buzz quit killing it
So buy another round; they tried to shut us down
About an hour ago, but we still in this bitch
We still in this, we still in this bitch
We still in this, we still in this bitch
Turn this shit up loud, and buy another round
They tried to shut us down about an hour ago, but we still in this bitch

[Young Jeezy]
I can do this shit all night cause I can stay up
That Rollie pull your bitch on sight, that's a lay up
I blew about a 40 last night, that's a Jacob
Had her face on my Givenchy jeans, left her makeup
Nigga I been running this for bout 8 straight summers
I got mine off the stove like the chef at Benihana's
Nigga this is my year, fuck whoever don't like it
See that 2014 outside? Yeah that's my shit
I took a trip out of town, brought a hundred things on
I seen Jeezy in the club, he had a hundred chains on
Just left the 'sace store, you know I'm killin this hit
It's the remix killer, yeah I'll kill ya remix
Whassup!

[B.o.B]
They said, "Bobby slow the flow down, you're burning all the dro down"
I tear the fucking club from the ceiling to the floor down
And I ain't talking dancing when I tell them it's a hoedown
And now she getting low down, that ass getting tore down
Cause we still in this bitch
There's a glass in my hand, I ain't spilling this shit
I hop out the fucking coupe like it really ain't shit
Man come to think about it, niggas really ain't shit
I go tough, I go stupid
And I get brawlin' baby, I beat that coochie
Now go and throw them legs up, let's make a movie
She asked me can she get it from the back? Absolutely bitch, absolutely

[Hook]

[Young Dro]
Ok I'm still in this bitch, I'm killin this bitch, lame ass ho, ain't feeling that chick
Man I'm like a big turd on the ground, and y'all are like flies come get on this shit
I'm emptying gauges, hit 'em in faces, blow a nigga body in different places
Man a nigga Young Dro still in this bitch, it's been a long time, that nigga courageous
I'm raw, period, pussy nigga fearing it, calm down Dro, ain't goddamn hearing it
Nigga got caught well then I'm goddamn clearin' it up, nigga what's up? Feeling it?
Layin' in the bed, getting head by Hilary, check my strap, check my artillery
Me and B.o.B. and GDOD, rollin' up the wrong way feelin it
Testatosa; burnin' these fuck niggas just like Sosa
And I'll fuck your bitch on the sofa, in this bitch, please close the door sir
I'm a lion boy I go rahh-rahh
Desert Eagle clip up in this bitch and that thing go pow pow

[Hook]

[Yo Gotti]
I'm Yo Gotti but I think I'm B.o.B., got bricks on bricks on C.O.D
That check's on deck, them cars on deck, that cocaine on delivery
I'm in my kitchen I'm cooking it
Bitch want a plane ticket, I'm booking it
CMG that muscle gang, TIP that Hustle Gang
Brand dick all in what's her name, never gonna mention no buster name
Got wordplay like that Rosa gang, make one phone call that get a bus of caine
That Forbes list, shoulda been on it, niggas talk beef but really don't want it
I doubt it if you batted, I pull up and jump up out it
Burn faith no mad dome, check your wise cracking
Left the tech to see exactly, lick the shells, try to count it
Last seen in an Audi, turn a million for a bounty
