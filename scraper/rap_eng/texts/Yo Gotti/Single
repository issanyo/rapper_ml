[Hook: Yo Gotti & Stuey Rock]
Say I need a single, so here ya go
Nigga say he need a single I told em 24
She ask me am I single, I told her damn right
Yeah she got a man but she single for the night
Single, single, single, single, single uh uh oh oh oh oh
She single for the night
Single, single, single, single, single uh uh oh oh oh oh
I'm single for the night

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Trap talk, homie say he wanna single
Hood nigga, hit my bong and a can of pringles
I get paid to hit the club I don't come to mingle
How you let a nigga kill you on ya own single?
Hit a single button and my whole top gone
Hit my plug up and put my whole block on
40 Glock on 32 shots strong, 70 bands 100 carats, one watch on
I'm single. 10 carats on my finger, looking for a thick bad bitch like Trina
She committed but still let me hit it, if it's bout a single dollar then you know that I'm with it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Sell em by the single but I buy em by the pairs
Talkin squares all white like some Nike Airs
Single horse on the car, couple hundred grand
Single pots, single stove, single wedding bands
Yeah I'm married to the game what you know about it
Young, fly, rich nigga ask ya ho about it
4 singles in a split, pair of red bottoms
Yeah we rock'em like they Jordans, whole squad got'em
Single, dope boy announcement, standin on the couches, middle finger to the bouncers
I am, like Queen Latifa. I'm out here living single, ask about me in the hood I got more stripes than the Bengals
