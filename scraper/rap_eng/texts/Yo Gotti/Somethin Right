[Hook: Big KRIT]
I heard them haters talking, them hoes fucking
The bank love me, I must be doing somethin’ right
I heard the law was watchin’, they can’t stop it
They won’t catch me, I must be doing somethin’ right
Somethin’ right, somethin’ right, somethin’ right
I must be doing somethin’ right
Somethin’ right, somethin’ right
This shit here ain’t over night
I must be doing somethin’ right

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
My nigga said “get money” so I did it
Gotta blot that alpaca partner, that shit expensive
Bitch I’m pimpin’ on a daily basis, gotta love it
Haters talk that shit, but duck and hide, I’m out in public
Fuck these haters and these hoes, nigga, that’s how I feel
Ain’t no restin’ with my goals, nigga, that shit for real
Bitch I’m fresher than grandmama’s biscuits, out the oven
MC Hammer, too legit to quit, they can’t touch me

[Hook: Big KRIT]
I heard them haters talking, them hoes fucking
The bank love me, I must be doing somethin’ right
I heard the law was watchin’, they can’t stop it
They won’t catch me, I must be doing somethin’ right
Somethin’ right, somethin’ right, somethin’ right
I must be doing somethin’ right
Somethin’ right, somethin’ right
This shit here ain’t over night
I must be doing somethin’ right

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
This that old Gotti flow, ‘04, ten years ago
They were talking platinum plaques on records, I was talking blow
KRIT, what it is? What I live nigga, pistol packin’
Robbin’ everyday to pay the bills, shit real in the field
I tell it how it is, five for a hundred grand it up on a mil
Young nigga ill, going for the kill
Five million on a crib, just shut down LIV
I’mma keep these niggas talkin’

[Hook: Big KRIT]
I heard them haters talking, them hoes fucking
The bank love me, I must be doing somethin’ right
I heard the law was watchin’, they can’t stop it
They won’t catch me, I must be doing somethin’ right
Somethin’ right, somethin’ right, somethin’ right
I must be doing somethin’ right
Somethin’ right, somethin’ right
This shit here ain’t over night
I must be doing somethin’ right

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
Ballin’ out in my city, drop the top and I pop the doors
Tailor made my nigga, gotta catch a flight just to shop for clothes
This ain’t a game my nigga, although I’m winning on another level
Couldn’t dig it with a bulldozer, remote control
Or 30 hoes, 30 pimps, 30 shovels like damn
Bottle service like “man, who the artist?”
Valet car parading these kind of blades you can barely park ‘em
Now straighten up, straighten up, straighten up, straighten up
These niggas shells, so I'll give em' hell
The very minute I’m waking up ‘cause

I must be doing somethin’ right
Somethin’ right, somethin’ right
