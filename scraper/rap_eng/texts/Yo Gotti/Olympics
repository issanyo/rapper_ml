[Hook: Yo Gotti]
I deserve a gold medal, Olympics
The way I do my thing in the kitchen
Just broke a world record, Guinness
Went to culinary arts but you don’t hear me
Got the work ridin’ ‘round in a hemi
Got the purp ridin’ ‘round in a hemi
Got the stick ridin’ ‘round in a hemi
Got your bitch ridin’ ‘round in a hemi

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I just pulled up at Privé in that Hellcat
Just shitted on these niggas, do you smell that?
When you violate parole, where the cell at?
Lil homie just pissed thirty, yeah you feel that
A hood nigga with millions, they be fearing that
You hating is a disease, ain’t no curing that
When it’s war no explanations, I ain’t hearing that
I make all my niggas bonds, I’m insuring that
I been up for four days, forty rounds with four Ks
Some my niggas on cocaine, some my niggas on codeine
I just bought a Stingray for my lil young bitch
She took a pistol charge for me on some dumb shit

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
I deserve a gold medal, Olympics
The way I do my thing in the kitchen
Just broke a world record, Guinness
Went to culinary arts but you don’t hear me
Got the work ridin’ ‘round in a hemi
Got the purp ridin’ ‘round in a hemi
Got the stick ridin’ ‘round in a hemi
Got your bitch ridin’ ‘round in a hemi

[Verse 2: MoneyBagg Yo]
Two Cuban links and a Rollie, that’s my double trophies
Made the work disappear, call that hocus pocus
The streets keep on calling me, tryna keep my focus
Got bread on me, got lead on me, won’t catch me loafing
I drunk a four of some Hi-Tech
You might catch me dozing
I’m kicking shit in the projects
You might catch me posted
Riding ‘round with the stick in the Audi
Couple gangster niggas with me, they ‘bout it
Trifling bitch eat the dick like candy
I’m a dog, I’m a savage, Randy
I deserve a million dollars, I’ve been trill, no EMT
I’m the shit, now I get followed, paparazzi, TMZ
Ho your nigga sound like Stevie, man that boy ain’t seeing me
I do my thing in the streets, off of beats I’m selling P’s

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
I deserve a gold medal, Olympics
The way I do my thing in the kitchen
Just broke a world record, Guinness
Went to culinary arts but you don’t hear me
Got the work ridin’ ‘round in a hemi
Got the purp ridin’ ‘round in a hemi
Got the stick ridin’ ‘round in a hemi
Got your bitch ridin’ ‘round in a hemi

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Riding shotgun in that Rari with Youngsta
Still got thirties on the Chevy ‘cause I’m country
I’m addicted to the jewelry, ask the jeweler
I’m a rich dope boy, don’t know nobody cooler
My lil young bitch don’t know shit but I’ma school her
Told her take them Jordans off and put these Loubs on
This a Chanel bag, you deserve that
You got Chanel swag, you got Michelle swag
I feel like Obama, push a button and get Osama
Watch when I drop this CM9 I’ma kill the summer
Fucking up the streets always
I was getting it out the hallway
Selling fifty packs in [?]
Had to stack it up the small way

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
I deserve a gold medal, Olympics
The way I do my thing in the kitchen
Just broke a world record, Guinness
Went to culinary arts but you don’t hear me
Got the work ridin’ ‘round in a hemi
Got the purp ridin’ ‘round in a hemi
Got the stick ridin’ ‘round in a hemi
Got your bitch ridin’ ‘round in a hemi
