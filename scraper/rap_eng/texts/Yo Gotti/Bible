Church, hand on my gun hand on my Bible
Fingers on the trigger like vagina
The Bible open right there on the dresser
I just pray that all my enemies are watching me from heaven
I'm peeking round the corner before I turn that muthafucka
I played them corners like I'm Richard Sherman muthafucka
I play in my position on these niggas 1st and 10
Treating that prescription like a scripture amen (amen)
Now we in the kitchen with the chickens and the hens yeah!
Lord please forgive us but we sinning for the rent
I just popped 2 pills I feel them bitches kickin' in

I just rolled a blunt up in a page from the Bible
And all my niggas psycho and all my bitches spiteful
