[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I'm up working singing " In the Kitchen"
I got money, you wanna count it?
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Have you ever had a bounty?
If a nigga play with you right now today, is you really gone down em?
Or you gone talk about it, tweet about it?
Or you gone bump into him see about it?
Oh no, Oh no, you know not to ask me about it
Real gangstas don't talk homes, thats why i never speak about it
Strap, naw Ill never leave without it
Big Choppa, Ill never be without it
C M, Ill never eat without it
Never disrespect the king, you know you gotta see me about it (Lil Nigga)
