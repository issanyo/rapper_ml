[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Takin' care of the hood, you a general
I be talkin' real shit in general
Got a lot of keys like the janitor
Cleanin' out them keys got me an Aventador
Playin' with the keys like a piano
Shout out to my thick bitch in Atlanta
She a boss bitch, yeah she a boss bitch
I be downing pounds like I'm on Crossfit
Medusa heads, they're Versace
I'm rich from sellin' dope so I cannot be illuminati
My nigga 18 and he just caught him a body
First I made his bond then I bought him a Maserati
Congrats

Tat my name cross her hand and salute me
Got them mollys and them xans, that's a two piece
I got my main bitch ridin' like a Goonie
I got that duffle bag on me and it's Louie
I'm bout to do the whole dash out here grindin', grindin'
I got three mil all in jewelry, go ask Avianne
Ain't no brag in bossin', I caught the wave on 'em
You don't want no problems, we gon' lay on you
Step in the kitchen, it's woo
Strap with that carbon, it's woo
Sippin' that lean like Goose, I'm full of them drugs
I get dirty-dirty money, it's covered in blood
If you can't fuck no pop star you a scrub
Freebandz

They know chop-chop-chop-chop, they know this shit real
Takin' care of your kids - you a general
Fuck nigga, I don't do subliminals
Fuck nigga, I don't do no interviews
Bout no beef, bout no issues
