[Intro: K-Rino]
Yeah yeah yeah, cause I'm bout to be just like him
I'm bout to get in the Rap Game
I'ma have me a car, I'ma have them rims, have them rings he got, them diamonds, women around him just like he got
I'm about to do the same thing he do blow up overnight
Blow up overnight? Boy, hey man the game don't work like that for real
There's a lot to this game that you don't understand. I've been in this game a long time
Let me educate you

[Break:K-Rino]
You ain't ready, you ain't ready
You ain't ready, you ain't ready
You ain't ready, you ain't ready
It's real out here

[Verse 1: K-Rino]
This game ain't what you think it is dude, it's so deep
You ready to grind all day and night and get no sleep?
Push from the ground up to make your city proud
Rock the stage with only 10 or 12 people in the crowd
Stay true and do things that other artists wouldn't even do
Deal with family members and friends who don't believe you
Practice with all your might to make your lyrics tight
Work on one verse a whole night just to get it right
All the ups and the downs, the frustration and the stressing
Bad promo investments, long studio sessions
You ready for them tough shows and hating crowd tripping?
What about when the mic goes out or your CD starts skipping?
Jealous and lazy rappers in your clique mad because you hot
Holding the group back because they ain't got the drive you got
How you gon' to feel when it goes to happiness to not fun
Tryna hustle CDs and nobody will buy one

[Hook: K-Rino]
You think you ready for this grind boy? (You ain't ready)
Ready to put all that time boy? (Hell naw!)
You think the game is all pretty and sweet
It ain't nothing like that fake sh' you see on TV
You think you ready for the game fool? (He ain't ready)
The disappointments and pain fool? (Hell naw!)
You think the game is all pretty and sweet
It ain't nothing like that fake sh' you see on TV

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
What's gon' happen when you dropped the best song you ever made?
And the DJ tell you, you got to pay him to get it played
When you getting a few shows and you still ain't ahead
And 30 club promoters tryna cheat you out your bread
Are you mentally prepared for what you plan on pursuing?
Are you strong enough to handle if the crowd starts booing?
This ain't a joke, sooner than later you'll realize
You're putting yourself out there for the world to criticize
Can you handle the pressure that comes with being an artist?
Reading internet comments about how your album is garbage
You ready to hit the road for two months to push a record?
Signing a contract before you let your lawyer check it?
Cats bootlegging your CD's at the hood corner stores
Somebody with no talent getting rich off yours
Are you ready for that deal that's going to get you some juice
And not even owning the songs that you wrote and produced

[Hook: K-Rino]
You think you ready for this grind boy? (You ain't ready)
Ready to put all that time boy? (Hell naw!)
You think the game is all pretty and sweet
It ain't nothing like that fake sh' you see on TV
You think you ready for the game fool? (He ain't ready)
The disappointments and pain fool? (Hell naw!)
You think the game is all pretty and sweet
It ain't nothing like that fake sh' you see on TV

[Verse 3: K-Rino]
Are you ready for that quick fame that comes up on you?
Fans who love you one year, but next year turn on you
All them blood sucking friends tryna use and leech ya
People hitting you up wanting free shows and features
When the hood tell you you capping and you no longer down
Can you not cheat on your woman when there's groupies around?
When your label tells you you're too hard, you're too strong
Are you ready to sell your soul to make so some satanic songs?
What you gon' do when you're tired and fans approach you
Are you ready to take pictures and sign thousands of posters
Take you a seat, this game was born in the streets
It ain't soft and sweet, can you handle drama and beef?
What's gon' happen when there's no more cars and no more blinging?
When the girls stop screaming and the phone stops ringing
You ready for this lifestyle or just blowing smoke
Selling a million records and still being broke

[Hook: K-Rino]
You think you ready for this grind boy? (You ain't ready)
Ready to put all that time boy? (Hell naw!)
You think the game is all pretty and sweet
It ain't nothing like that fake sh' you see on TV
You think you ready for the game fool? (He ain't ready)
The disappointments and pain fool? (Hell naw!)
You think the game is all pretty and sweet
It ain't nothing like that fake sh' you see on TV
