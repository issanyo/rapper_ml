The party is going wild, tonight's the night
(Come On x2)
This party is on fire, put up your lights
(Let's go x2)
The party is going wild, tonight's the night
(Come On x2)
This party is on fire, put up your lights
(Let's go x2)

[Verse 1: Da Boss]
They call you the "Bling" put yo' jewels looked spoiled
Your Platinum Chains look like aluminum foil
Hats too small, 'cause yo' heads too big
Got hair under your arms, like a real big wig
Stop! Quit, Bling Retire, yo' breath so bad that yo' face needs a shower, Marathon Wash, 2 or 3 hours, The roof of your mouth
Yo' mouth is on FIRE!


It's about to go down
(come on x2)
Its about to go down
(come on x2)
Put your hands in the air, it's about to go down!


[Verse 2: Bling]
They call you the "Da Boss" but you have no wealth
No employees, you should fire yourself
Your pants so tight, that you can barely move
You'r a bum, that says "I'll rap or food!"
You'r an Actor dude, with an attitude
I'm the streets theme song
You're an interlude
Gonna put you on a plate
Watch you get chewed
They should call you a ghost
The way you get booed!

The party's gone wild
Tonight's the night (Come on, come on)
This club is on fire
Put up your lights (Let's go, let's go)
[x2]

Anything you can do
I can do better
Bring it when you want to
I'm ready whenever

Show me what you got, got
I'll show you what I got, got
Will you rise or fall?
The winner takes all!

Lights up, lights up [x4]
C'mon, c'mon
Lights up, lights up
C'mon, c'mon
Lights up, lights up
C'mon, c'mon
Lights up, lights up
C'mon, c'mon

[Verse 3: Truth]
I know I'm ready and able
But still a kid bussin' all of these tables
I can show I got what it takes
But I already used my fifteen minute break
I'm, working for minimum wage
When I should be up on the stage
Feel like I'm in the cage, I need to turn the page
'Cause the other guy's a fake, I could leave the crowd amazed

The party's gone wild
Tonight's the night (C'mon, c'mon)
This club is on fire
Put up your lights (Let's go, let's go)
[x2]

[Verse 4: Da Boss]
I'm Bling like my watch
So let's get it tockin'
Your clothes full of holes
Like your granny's ripped stockings
Your style is old
Not a good look
Watch the boss get burnt
Like the food she cooks

Bling, I think you need a shower
I hear you scream
But your odor's much louder

[Verse 5: Bling]
No, that's the sound of victory
Now do your day job
And get my car for me

The party's gone wild
Tonight's the night (C'mon, c'mon)
This club is on fire
Put up your lights (Let's go, let's go)
