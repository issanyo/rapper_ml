[Intro]
Nixies Vicci on the beat
Ya ugh
It was all a dream , ya

[Verse 1: Nixies Vicci]
Vicci, swerve
I done came a long way
So I be doing it my way
To everybody that came my way
Flexing a nigga is a regular thing
But they hating shit and am faded
You drowned and I made it
Your time to watch n my time to shine
But the 3,4 times I punched it
Devil with smoke but never the most high
Got the pedal to the metal when am inside
And I hate it that I get it underrated
Overrated cause I did it in a minute, and am in it and i mean it
Who you pray to? when your eyes close
And that mind blown
And your sins got you feeling all awful
Put your trust in the Lord and a lot will come
Am out of my mind
Spitting these rhymes
Or maybe am just, trynna make Dabreezy believe me
I swear am putting a grip on my life
From the core but I shine brighter than xenon lights
Can't get on my level you niggas scared of heights
Make a nigga don't say shit
Got my haters thinking am a racist
Am too fly, couldn't touch this
If you thinking am a star, then watch me
Talking 'bout me am outta this station
Swag that a nigga couldn't mention
When you trynna get it right
But you end up in a fight
And mama was right, when she said
"never drink, liquor
You gotta think, bigger
So you better climb the top
And you know you wouldn't drop
Ambition, ambition, ambition i mean"
These rhymes in my backpack
Bringing that dope back
Consider the fact that
We back on track
I tied myself to a big ass dream
And a team, that's bringing me progress, true
[Hook: Bob]
They doubted us
Never believed in us
We started from the bottom
Now we heading to the top
From below to above, now we heading to the top
Top, top, top
See i came a long way hommie to be where am is
Can't tell me nothing hommie I deserve this shit
See I work hard, I grind hard, I pray hard and I stay up
They trynna bring me down, but ainâ€™t backing down

[Bridge: Bob & (Rimz-Matic P)]
(ya)
I say I ain't backing down
(tell em)
Nigga I ain't backing down, oh no
(ya Rimz-Matic)
I ain't backing down, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Rimz-Matic P]
They trynna, kill my vibe
Trynna steal my drive
I feel my pride
As I play my role, what I visualize
They can never stop
Can never be stopped
Can never put off, my candles of hope
I treat this game like a drug addict, forever dope
Can never change but I switch quick, optimus prime
Venomous rhyme, ambitious
Haters you can't stitch us
We ain't Lilo
Am getting that green like Cee-lo
Came from the bottom
I had the nerves, now am giving 'em waves
Shine as a photon, hold on
From 9-6 when Pac died
Sometimes I feel I was born for this
This hype is giving me a bad vibe
Causing harm, am a swine in this
Treat this rap like shitty girls
Shoot 'em up, am Oscar
Over and over, rotation like Gucci
In my mind I prosper
Cut a rapper, feeling like Tunechi
Rep my clique when I crip, got love for DR3AM TEAM urh P!
Am on the track like Usain Bolt
Giving ya heat, hell say hot
Am spitting and ripping
Am moving and roving, the top is mine
Can't stop this grind
I over-do it
Been thru a lot, came a long way
When am on play, put my soul to it
My talk fluent
My rev for the brave
When the righteous curve
And your life is death
Ignite this rage "i made it"
A goal getter, my flow better
Got more haters, am faded
Get it?
