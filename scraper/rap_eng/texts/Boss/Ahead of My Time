(DaredevyL Verse)
I took some losses
Ran it back up and I shook em off me
Nigga done crossed me
It’s a dirty game better be cautious
I been on some boss shit
You niggas just talkin doin that often
I’m blowin that hawk shit
And it got me coughing it got me nauseous
I’m swerving in every lane
Took the top off the bitch still give me hella brain
I been the same nigga through all of this
And bitch I ain’t gone ever change
I might just marry the money
Go call Avionne go get me a wedding ring
Yo bitch keep her head in my lap
I guess you can say she ahead of things
But fuck all these slutty hoes
They just here for fun I’m in here on a money run
They hit me up for the walkthrough
And I got it poppin like a hundred guns
The donk sit 24 inches high paint wet like a honey bun
And if I don’t get it right Pedro will fuck nigga that’s a 1-and-1

(Chorus)
I’m breaking down big buds of the gas roll it up with the savages
You ain’t gotta cuff her you ain’t gotta cuff her you ain’t gotta I done had the bitch
I’m sippin’ Hennessy tonight put the double cups up no Actavis
Sauce drippin like a faucet I was born with it nigga you can’t practice this

I’m ahead of my time ahead of my time bitch I’m ahead of my time
I’m ahead of my time ahead of my time bitch I’m ahead of my time
I’m ahead of my time ahead of my time bitch I’m ahead of my time
I’m ahead of my time head of my time bitch I’m ahead of my time

(Pedro Verse)
I went in autopilot
I rolled me a joint now the Tesla talkin to me
I muted everybody
I couldn’t understand em’ man they always sounding stupid
I had a choice to make
Go out and get it or run with these broke niggas
And I ain’t no broke nigga
You blow it on hoes I’m stacking this dough nigga
I seen the bottom nigga
I was a scavenger I was possum nigga
Now I’m colossal nigga
The King of the jungle I’m talkin Mufasa nigga
I need a doctor nigga
Flow getting sicker this ain’t rap I’m coughing nigga
I might just off a nigga
Aye I want the W ain’t no more losses nigga
But fuck all the hatin hoes and the bums
The skinny nigga used to scrape crumbs
Mo money mo problems
What did you expect man they hated God’s son
We want it all and gettin to this paper to us it never been an option
And if I don’t get it right DevyL will fuck nigga that’s a 1-and-1

(Chorus)
I’m breaking down big buds of the gas roll it up with the savages
You ain’t gotta cuff her you ain’t gotta cuff her you ain’t gotta I done had the bitch
I’m sippin’ Hennessy tonight put the double cups up no Actavis
Sauce drippin like a faucet I was born with it nigga you can’t practice this

I’m ahead of my time ahead of my time bitch I’m ahead of my time
I’m ahead of my time ahead of my time bitch I’m ahead of my time
I’m ahead of my time ahead of my time bitch I’m ahead of my time
I’m ahead of my time head of my time bitch I’m ahead of my time

(Boss Verse)
Niggas tried to count me out
Wanna see me down bad
But I stayed ten toes down
Grinding for everything I have
Niggas ain’t have me shit
But want the credit like they ahead of my grind
My nigga unwind
Always been told I was head of my time
Ahead of my time ahead of my time
These niggas been watching my grind
But they can’t do it like it do it
And they can’t move like I move
I’m the Boss baby
I’ll have you drunk off game
But I ain’t even said shit
Good game for you lames
See Pedro made you pay attention
And DevyL gave you good vibes
31 days I be counting
24 hours I’m high
I keep my lil 38 with me
In case a nigga wanna try it
And if it ain’t bout gettin’ money
Please don’t hit my line

(Chorus)
I’m breaking down big buds of the gas roll it up with the savages
You ain’t gotta cuff her you ain’t gotta cuff her you ain’t gotta I done had the bitch
I’m sippin’ Hennessy tonight put the double cups up no Actavis
Sauce drippin like a faucet I was born with it nigga you can’t practice this

I’m ahead of my time ahead of my time bitch I’m ahead of my time
I’m ahead of my time ahead of my time bitch I’m ahead of my time
I’m ahead of my time ahead of my time bitch I’m ahead of my time
I’m ahead of my time head of my time bitch I’m ahead of my time
