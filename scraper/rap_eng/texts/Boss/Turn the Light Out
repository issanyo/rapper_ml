[Intro: K-Rino]
Aiyo we do this for real
Ain't no grand standing
We ain't tryna showboat
Cats who showboat leave the spot with no throat
Boss on the beat, come on

[Verse 1: K-Rino]
Sickest to ever do it, no ifs, buts or maybes
Came before my time like a premature baby
Passing your sight level by mashing the right pedal
They thought I had a grill but it was chewed up mic metal
I'm thresher than rain water, you ain't ready for a dose of this
Catalog longer than a fat dude's grocery list
Still I'm never changing up, your career's flaming up
Like a winter coat in mid-July, you need to hang it up
Once my enemy starts pretending he hard
I get madder than Kanye when he don't win an award
When my throat starts clearing watch them killer lyrics start appearing
Dirty labels tryna sign me like I'm hard at hearing
The known rebel, for ordinary I won't settle
I'm so clever I can't even reach my own level
Original bars, I'm sick like I'm out of meds
I heard you paying for your lines like a powder head

[Chorus: K-Rino]
Turn the lights out on 'em, turn the lights out on 'em
Anybody think they rough on the mic, I want 'em
If he ever raise up and try to fight back with me
I'ma make sure they see you getting mic slapped quickly

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
