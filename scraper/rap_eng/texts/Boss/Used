[Intro]
So I be on tha high-tension wire
So, I be a little bit high right now
E.M.S

[Verse 1]
Oh no, so I lay back and relax
Lookin' right in your face
Oh no, I said, I lay back and relax
Smokin' ma marijuana, (na-ah)
Baby you snobbin' and formin'
'Cause you got boobies and titties
You keep catwalkin' and talkin' like you are priceless
'Em Niggas used that
You are a used shit
I need no used shit
I need'a new bitch

[Bridge]
You are a used shit (I need'a new shit)
I need no used shit (I need'a new shit)
I need'a new shit (I need'a new shit)
I mean a good bitch
You are a used shit (I need'a new shit)
I need no used shit (I need'a new shit)
I need'a new shit (I need'a new shit)
I mean a good bitch

[Verse 2]
Fresh out the oven, She told me, “E, Stop
You're disrespectin' me, Nigga, for what?
I gotta tell you, Nigga, that's enough or I'ma pick​ a knife and put it in your heart
You never know what it's like growin' up as a little kid havin' no Dad and no Mom
You've disrespected me, Nigga, for what?
I gotta tell you, Nigga, fuck it, that's enough
You never know what it's like havin' no food and no shelter, Nigga you been there before?
You never no what it's like havin' nothin' to certify you for a job
Nigga, why you justifyin' all actions that I took so I may succeed
You've disrespected me, Nigga, for what?
I gotta tell you, Nigga, fuck it, that's enough
Worry me not till you clean up your anus
Real money comes when I hop on this penis
You've disrespected me, Nigga, for what?
I gotta tell you, Nigga, fuck it, that's enough
This gonna be the last time that I tell you
Next time I'd be forced to silence you
Where are your manners? Heard that you lost it
Better ask your bitch to help you go find it”

[Verse 3]
Couldn't ignore that, I told her, “V, stop
You gettin' angry, baby, for what?
I gotta tell you, baby, that enough or I'ma beat the fuckin' Devil out your soul
There are so many ways to make that money rather than fuckin' niggas, baby you know
You gettin' angry, baby, for what?
I gotta tell you, baby, fuck it, that enough
The truth is bitter, better get used to it
I'm a preacher I ain't paint no picture
If Gabriel stabs you today and Beelzebub calls me I'ma tell him, “Hey, never you stitch her
Fact; 'No nobody wants to marry you 'Cause all 'em Niggas know you've been overused'
You gettin' angry, baby, for what?
I gotta tell you, baby, fuck it, that enough
Ain't got ma time 'Cause I ain't got those pennies
You'll have ma time when I'm finally famous
You gettin' angry, baby, for what?
I gotta tell you, baby, fuck it, that enough
This gonna be the last time that I tell you
Next time it ain't gon be me and you
Where's your virginity? Heard that you lost it
That I really know you can never find it”

[Outro]
'Em Niggas used that
You are a used shit
I need'a new shit
