Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
End up like a dog that's been beat too much
Till you spend half your life just to cover it up, now

Born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A., now

Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hands
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man

Born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A

Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man says, "Son, if it was up to me..."
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said, "Son, don't you understand, now?"

Oh yea
Oh no
No, no,no

I had a brother at Khe Sahn
Fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms, now

Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
Ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run, ain't got nowhere to go

Born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A., now
Born in the U.S.A
I'm a long gone daddy in the U.S.A., now

Born in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A
Born in the U.S.A
I'm a cool rocking daddy in the U.S.A., now

Oh no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Oh no, no
Oh no, no
Wooh
