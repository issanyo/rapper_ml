[Bo$$]
Who am I to flip a wicked Bitch?
Business is Business
But now the revelation has revealed
How the Bo$$ Bitch is trying to get rich!
And doing a good job
And rippin' up the pavement with 'nuff shit
Aww shit!!
I think I jumped into a maze
And now I'm being surrounded by dead niggas in a daze
Some kind of way I have become a slave
Yes sir Masta
No sir Masta
I work fasta, even if it means my brain being tampered with
Fuck it!
At least I got rid of the pamper
Lata on I mix up with some G's
Kickin' it on the corner curb
Talkin' about expanding to Pittsburgh
I'm out here on the cut smokin' bud with Macaroni
Instead of us servin' niggas this fucka's tryin' to bone me
But I ain't trying to hear this Bitch made elf
I ain't in the mood
Cause I don't fuck around with the help bastard!
If it wasn't for the dope that we got stashed in the casket
I'd have your ass hit
Then watch the fool die trickin!
While I be countin' crispy ass dollars
Like Louisana fried chicken
And takin a sip of his favorite drink
At the grave as I stare through the shade
Your shit still stinks!
I wasn't tryin' to see an explanation
Cause as far as I'm concerned the only way to progress
Is through elimination!

Hook:
Got's to go yeah
Got to go
The Bo$$ no loss
What ever the cost
Elimination
Got's to go yeah
Got to go

[Bo$$]
Time is running out I'm still self employed
They talking this Pitt shit but I'm tryin to get back to DETROIT!
Fuck it if I need to do these niggas I'm a do 'em too
And step the fuck off as if I never knew them fools
See ya!
Now the shit is going my way
I'm hittin' the highway
No mo' drive by's
In my drive way
This is what's happening
I'm finally at my destination
I ain't one of 'dem bitches tryin'
I gotta get crackin' fuck a curling iron
I'll get that shit did lata
Meanwhile I'm on some ol'
Bucka a sucka quick shit fo paper and
I'm disectin' at the same time progressin'
Eliminating like a lunatic shootin quick
Call it what you want but I'll be brief
I don't trust a motha fucka
Unless a motha fucka is me g!
Getting' sweated is just an inspiration
So I don't regret it when you get your BC date
Cause it's all about elimination
(got to go yeah, got to go)
Fuck up and I'll have yo ass hitch hikin'
From Idaho Yo!
Bo$$ is knockin' out silly shit
Let me hit this philly spliff
Now it's time to really trip
I gettin the feelin' that these niggas
Is into my shit
Plus the muchies got me wanting a burger
But first the murder
Knockin' em off was a cinch but I'm stuck
And ain't no way that I'm a rest my head on
Another bench Fuck!
I'm sick of this shit
Let me slip into this alley
And try to fly as high as I can get
With 200 blunts and 100 spliffs
(tryin to make it to Detroit, Detroit)
Now every member of my click is in his grave
I'm truly the BO$$ bitch now
Nobody's slave!
How do I plea?
Listen! I'll neva give an explanation
Cause as far as I'm concerned
The only way to progress is through
Elimination!

Hook:

Gots to go yeah got to go
The BO$$ no loss
At whateva the cost
Elimination
