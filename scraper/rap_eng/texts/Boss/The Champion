[Intro: K-Rino]
Yeah
This goes out to all the lyrical champions
All around the world I salute you
Cause not many people can do what we do
Ha!
Come on

[Verse 1: K-Rino]
Let me describe my demeanour
I'm the gladiator who teamed up with the lion and then slaughtered every person in the arena
The far distant planet born, half human and panther spawn
The neck of your most respected champion I'm trampling on
Jagged spikes on my shoes; backs: I'm dancing on
Before my enemy was ever born I wrote an answer song
And it was relevant to the presidents; I explain
When I feel disdain I instantly grow a lion's mane
This guy's insane but I'm too savage to try and tame
What the poison wouldn't fry his veins well let's try his brain
Lyrical superman who swings pens with a ruthless hand
And if I connect right your whole crew would land in the Yucatan
Once my talent is sharpened
I'll be able to contort and morph into a talking land-walking dolphin
A feat that you won't witness too often
Shatter your thoughts without caution like a loose bull in a porcelain auction

[Chorus]
I'm the champion of words with steel in my nerves
In unmatched degrees of concentration I'm submerged
The metaphorical mastery, the nouns and the verbs
Light years ahead of the curve, the best you've never heard
I'm the champion of words, the mind power surge
In unmatched degrees of concentration I'm submerged
The metaphorical mastery, the nouns and the verbs
Light years ahead of the curve, the best you've never heard

[Verse 2]
No need to wonder where my squad be cause I'm so hard G
That when I need help I pick up a phone and call me
And while my clone soars to the Earth from Zone 4
I wait inside the home until I show up at my own door
See I don't need to use a weapon fool
I'll drink rocket unleaded fuel, aim jet propelled and shoot myself at you
My first thought was to forfeit ya
No solvin' the crime til they find your body parts in the trunk of an Ultima
I only snap on war tracks I rapidly leap buildings with 90 floors flat
Skyscrapers look like door mats
Books I explore for more facts
My mic contains spikes and claws that bore through your back and tore cracks in your thorax
Then burn right through your sternum
Like twenty five hundred degree Fahrenheit strikes of ignited thermite
Mental methods were intercepted wiped out every living dentist in 20 seconds
Killin' efforts of them checkin your dental records

[Chorus]
I'm the champion of words with steel in my nerves
In unmatched degrees of concentration I'm submerged
The metaphorical mastery, the nouns and the verbs
Light years ahead of the curve, the best you've never heard
I'm the champion of words, the mind power surge
In unmatched degrees of concentration I'm submerged
The metaphorical mastery, the nouns and the verbs
Light years ahead of the curve, the best you never heard

[Verse 3]
State of emergency disaster no survival routes
Inside a pouch in my pocket is where I hide your house
Scar you up and bleed you in a non-violent bout
My passes cracked your skull open, his brain just started sliding out
At noon time I write a harpoon rhyme
Got arrested on Neptune for tryna transport galactic moonshine
Wars I win them, my mouth releases slimy venom
I throw water balloons that got tsunamis in 'em
I start shellacking you and leave holes in the back of you
My words enhance vision like an Acuvue contact will do
Then what occurs is the most insulting vocal slur
If you decide to go postal, I'll go postal-er
We got a lot of spirit realms which would your ghost prefer
Smoke them up until his flesh smell like roasted fur
I show up after 2 am and invade your space
And kick your door so hard it will knock over your neighbours place

[Chorus]
I'm the champion of words with steel in my nerves
In unmatched degrees of concentration I'm submerged
The metaphorical mastery, the nouns and the verbs
Light years ahead of the curve, the best you've never heard
I'm the champion of words, the mind power surge
In unmatched degrees of concentration I'm submerged
The metaphorical mastery, the nouns and the verbs
Light years ahead of the curve, the best you've never heard
