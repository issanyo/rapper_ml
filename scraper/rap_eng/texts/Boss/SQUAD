Aye,Aye
It's StubbyBabi
You ready
Well let's go!
I'm in here with the Squad
Me and my set
Yeah we go hard
Our individuality's goin' take us real far
We are who we are
You can't stop us
NOO SURRR(sir)!!
We go harder than the base that's in that million dollar car!
Yeah we running pass these losers
Flying round like winners
When they goin' catch-up?
They ain't never goin' get us!
(HOLD -UP)
When it's goin' be your turn?
When we decide to finish
That ain't no time soon
I'm in here with my Squadets
Talking 'bout your Goons

HOOK

SQUADDDDDDD!
