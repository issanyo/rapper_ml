[Chorus: Ka]
Turn my gaze towards my soul
See some demons, some dragon, some trolls
Draw my trusty rusty sword
Slay some demon, some dragon, some trolls

[VERSE 1: Ka]
Life force me to look inna di dark
Where the dawg a bark
This a no walk inna di park
On the verge of distraught
Almost fall apart
For this the doctors them
No have no chart
Even though me feel the fear when me start
Me go on and me slice me enemy them apart
Step out, yeah, walk pon me path
But when me turn around me see
It all up inna me thoughts

[Chorus: Ka]
Turn my gaze towards my soul
See some demons, some dragon, some trolls
Draw my trusty rusty sword
Slay some demon, some dragon, some trolls

[VERSE 2: Ka]
It is like the bottom of the barrel
Like we inna the Ghetto where every day them empty barrel
Me no feel like the Happy song from Pharell
If you carry a heavy soul don't tell people that you feel well
Sometime it dark like
Light out inna the park like
Me no care how people inna the neighborhood a talk like
From you walk through hell you better keep up the walk like
Rub hard enough you a go see a spark light
