[Intro]
So anyway man, like I was sayin’ man um
Gettin’ ready to go to Hawaii, man
How I be gettin’ over there?
Ah you know, I prolly, I prolly drive the Phantom over to, over to Hawaii, man
Hop in the Phantom and drive over to Hawaii, man
Um, I gotta meet this old girl out here, man
I had this situation with the judge in court, man, my baby mama
She pay me 12,000 a month in child support, ya know
I’m cool with the judge, man, so he looked out for me
Oh yeah yeah oh yeah I saw the game last night, man
That boy LeBron gave a shoutout, his post-game interview, man
Ya know, they go back, man, they go back to Cleveland days, man

[Verse 1]
Boys be lying with laser like timing
Lying ‘bout what they driving and contracts they signing
The videos they made and the women that they laid
And she wasn’t a real model, that’s a stripper that you paid
Do your thing, you ain’t gotta explain it, it’s no need
Talkin’ ‘bout they running keys and they ain’t never sold weed
Said ya did some jail time but your tongue need ripping out
‘Cause you so scary you wouldn’t even send a traffic ticket out
You said you owned the club, now I’ma get ya
You that dude that’s in the back taking them $2 pictures
Of the ladies and the dudes doing jailhouse poses
Selling nasty ass buddha and the plastic ass roses
Said he had a studio, half a million it costed
He got a $100 mic inside his grandmama’s closet
Said he was the headman at a major corporate office
But I saw him getting baskets out the parking lot at Target, man!

[Chorus]
Boys be lyin’
But I ain’t tryna hear that noise this time
Boys be lyin’
But I ain’t tryna hear that noise this time

[Verse 2]
I done heard him tell every single lie that’s in the book
Said he got hands, but every fight he have he getting whooped
Getting stomped out, folded once that impact hit him
Said he goin’ to get some goons and brought his mama back with him
Can’t believe what I saw once I went to his crib
Said them pants was his girlfriend’s, knowing that they his
Lied to your own child, why you gotta be fronting though?
Told him you was on the way to get him, that was five months ago
You tripping bro, plus you a fraud in every way
You say you traveling the world but yet we see you every day
Wearing all that fake jewelry, acting like you was clean
I wasn’t even wearing a chain and my neck turned green
He took a picture at a mansion, that’s just like stealing
Put it online and typed in, "At the house just chilling"
Lied about your record sales but your game is sloppy
How you go platinum when you only made fifteen copies? I tell ya

[Chorus]
Boys be lyin’
But I ain’t tryna hear that noise this time
Boys be lyin’
But I ain’t tryna hear that noise this time

[Verse 3]
Will they tell the truth? I doubt that, they need to get their mouth checked
Said you bought my new project and it ain’t even out yet
What’s your favorite track? (Number 16, that’s my song now)
You a damn lie fool, it ain’t but 15 songs on there
Money money all day, yeah right, he just lied
That brand new ride you saw him in, that was just a test drive
Told me he was ‘bout to go on tour in the morning
I went to a open mic the next night, he was up in there performing
Said he was a player, all the top women he got ‘em
Then he bought some girl he just met a pair of red bottoms
And now it’s time to get you straight like hair with a perm on
Acting like he talkin’ business but that phone ain’t even turned on
It never takes a lot to get the game popping
Let ‘em tell it, they know every celebrity, name-dropping
Five star restaurants, boy you can’t pay that
‘Cause Popeye's is the most expensive place you ever ate at, c’mon

[Chorus]
Boys be lyin’
But I ain’t tryna hear that noise this time
Boys be lyin’
But I ain’t tryna hear that noise this time
