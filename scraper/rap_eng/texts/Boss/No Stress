[Intro: K-Rino]
Y'all don't know me, haha
You bout to get to know me real good, come on
Ain't nothing wrong man, everything is good
When you see me, drop all the drama
Watch how you do this

[Verse 1: K-Rino]
See, I know that life can be scandalous
I'm a wizard not a genie, but I'll grant a wish
Everybody needs a place that they can go rest
So right now you can call me Mr. No Stress
No storms, every sky that you see is sunny
Your baby mama called and asked if you needed money
Your car started, you ain't even have to flip your hood
Bill collector left a message said, "Don't trip, you good"
I got the power to reverse what you going through
Got your bread back from everybody who was owing you
Arguments, you ain't entertaining no thoughts of that
Your son and daughter ain't doing no talking back
Every trial now thrown in a separate pile
Every discrepancy you ever had reconciled
Do what you do, if the world wanna be mad let it
Every piece of drama, I'ma clean it up like bad credit

[Chorus x2: K-Rino]
When you know you gave your best
And people still wanna protest
When they surround you with more mess
Just call Mr. No Stress

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
Mr. No Stress, baby you ain't heard of me
I got you covered on them warrants, you can drive worry free
Money problems on your mind, tell you what I'm sent to do
You already got the job, no need for an interview
Nothing but love from every person who close to you
Baby daddy doing everything he supposed to do
The service I provide has nothing to do with ends
It's free of charge, take my card, pass it to your friends
Been a minute since you heard the word hate once
By the way your rent is paid up to eight months
Mind refresh, you ready for a bigger test
You forgot about the dope, liquor and cigarettes
People gossiping, no need to go back at 'em
You heard them women talk about you, you just laughed at 'em
You thinking it's a fantasy, but it can be real
Mr. No Stress, hit me if you need a refill

[Chorus x2: K-Rino]
When you know you gave your best
And people still wanna protest
When they surround you with more mess
Just call Mr. No Stress

[Verse 3: K-Rino]
I didn't come to put you down, I came to show you how
You can lift some of the stress off of your shoulders now
You control your own life, you don't need a horoscope
Reading what another fraud wrote, living on borrowed hope
Instead of solid faith, can't handle the sharp curves
You can't believe in that garbage bored in God's words
Don't be deceived by the fragrance of a fly aroma
The result of every condition's controlled by it's owner
Don't pop a vein, see nobody plays a perfect game
Strong minded people see the Sun during a hurricane
Sometimes others sell you dreams when they see your pain
Watch 'em 'cause the light at the tunnel's end could be a train
Remain sane, make the real effort to be the change
We don't even know the level of power that we contain
Keep in mind, mental stress can break a body down
You can never drown in evil waters 'long as God's around

[Chorus x2: K-Rino]
When you know you gave your best
And people still wanna protest
When they surround you with more mess
Just call Mr. No Stress

[Outro: K-Rino]
See, whatever you believe yourself to be
That's what you are man, you can't let problems at home
Problems at school, problems at work, haters on the block
You can't let these people dictate your mood and your reality, man
It's not who you are that holds you back
It's who you think you're not, call Mr. No Stress
