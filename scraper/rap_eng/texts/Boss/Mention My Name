[Hook: x2]
We make music for the love we ain't in for the fame
Cross the line and get'cha face broke it's simple and plain
Twenty years and I ain't changed my intentions the same
So you can't talk about the game unless you mention my name

[Verse 1:]
Yeah, it's certain people in this world you can't talk too
Some don't understand until they get they chest walked through
A pot-holes in they backs once the mack pops
I can't be destroyed I'm like a airplane's black box
Question is who's willing to be a sacrifice?
So rappers won't have to pay the price in the afterlife
Evacuate the premises; we ain't goin ask ya twice
Walk into a room cracking heads, no more acting nice
I stand hard and let em swang came too far to bend it
Plus I never needed? viagrace? at a soldered spin is
I'm rock-solid, brand new day the same ma-genders
I'm mobbed with F.O.I., street hustlers and gangbangers
The bridge is burn, the relationships beyond the groovement
Devils in power try'na execute the conscience movement
But if they try, get'cha heat and bring the thunder down
Since day one the realest music been the underground

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You can't write me out a history, go read your lesson
My essence is too deeply imbedded in the past and the present
They want to keep this real music off the station good
Less bars, fake radio, cats from coming in the hood (kill em)
My regine was established to torture your team
I'm leading corpses inside of this corporate machine
Commercial, radio ain't try'na resurrected the dead
So kill em all and bring the program direct it's head
See that's the only way a snake can ever be handled
No more meat, no more going through the proper channels
Keep stunning, it'll be your time to take some lead
I wish the DJ would ask me to break some bread
I got a circle of hot-heads that'll break ya legs
Y'all are kinda of casty pets communicate with feds
You don't control by destiny I got mine in my hand
Shoutout to Dre, I wish ya homie I'm try'na get banned

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Gravity's stunt on me better hope he last
Five lasers I blast with no ski-mask
Enter the suffering the end won't be fast
Murder your future and put'cha present in the past
Hoping he calm will K-Rino side trippin
It's bottom it'll get it poppin like grease and fried chicken
Undetectable bombs up in your ride diggin
The unmistakable sound of a soul five kickin
Don't be around and see em becoming you like Witted
Unless you gonna be a follower, follow the right leader
Ya still the grand dragon, show ya hand bragging
Ninety percent of rappers who riding on band-wagons
Wetting objects a man getting in your prophets
Quick the foil up when they threaten in ya pockets
Acting like you got no remorse for life
How you goin exit get pumped by corporate types?
You a fraud, living a lie and a facade
I'm under the control of no man regard
What's wrong when ya put'cha opportunities on
You really gone, anybody try'na do it alone
Not a problems that you can so honorable to stand
And the people at the shows you can't count on ya hand
Done with no love when a solid hitted fan
Spoken to spoke out right follow hit a fan
You was arrogant man, never been courted
With no respect of those who came before you
We can see it an evil side is disagreeable
Now people use your shirt to write in yo vehicles
Agree the main rights so ya mind will be tight
Stop try'na be like fools who try'na be like
Everybody who looking for a creative handout
Try'na stand in it's time to stand out

[Hook x2]
