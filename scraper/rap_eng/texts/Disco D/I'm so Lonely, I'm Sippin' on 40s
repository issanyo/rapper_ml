[Intro]
To what y'all been waitin' for, mean
Real talk
Look

[Hook]
…so lonely
I’m sippin’ on 40s
Cause I have nobody
Fuck all these hoes

[Verse 1]
Fell in love at the the age of 17
Loved her and she loved me
I thought that love would last
Bitch, our love didn’t last
Been faithful for 'bout a year
She cheated on me
Then I shed tears
She called back saying she’s so sorry
Fuck you, right now I’m lonely

[Hook]
Lonely
I’m sippin’ on 40s
Cause I have nobody
Fuck all these hoes
Lonely, so lonely
I’m sippin’ on 40s
Cause I have nobody
Fuck all these hoes

[Verse 2]
Aye, sitting in my room, all lonely
Actin’ like you don’t know me
I see you, then I wave hi
She looks at me, and then she say bye
Why you gotta be like that?
Callin’ me, sayin’ you want me back
I know somethin’ about you
You’re the type to fuck the whole crew
Go ahead and just do you
I'ma live my life, fuck you
That’s why I can’t trust these hoes
I’m happy all alone now

[Hook]
So lonely
Sippin’ on 40s
Cause I have nobody
Fuck all these hoes
So lonely
Sippin’ on 40s
Cause I have nobody
Fuck all these hoes

[Verse 3]
Aye, hoes gon' be hoes
And niggas gon' be niggas
That’s why I don’t trust nobody
All alone to sip the liquor
The girl that I was with always act suspicious
But I knew this whole time that she fuckin' with these niggas
Why do people cheat?
It don’t even make sense
Bitches want their pussy wet
And niggas wanna stick it in
They do some shady shit
Like cheatin’ on a friend
And the whole fuckin’ around with her nigga in the bed
Say lil' homie
Just chug another 40
Just chill with your niggas cause I know you feelin’ lonely
Go to the store and get a couple oggies
At the end of the night, I bet you won’t be feelin’ lonely
My rhymes are so dope
Everybody call me dopey
I’m a nigga from the hood
But the whole world knows me
Most people faithful, most people cheat
That’s why I run deep, when I sleep, when I eat
Run deep when I sleep, run deep when I creep
You had to do me wrong, so don’t ever fuck with me
You won’t do it again, that’s somethin’ I won’t believe
Once a cheater, always a cheater, so you gon' cheat
I’m like, “Fuck you!”
Got a fuck you attitude
Give a fuck about your problems
Fuck, what you gonna do?
You left me cold-hearted, so this is what Imma do
Sticking up the middle finger cause you’re fuckin’ with the crew
Now you’re tryin’ to prowl, tryin’ to play with my mind
I loved you a lot, but that was once upon a time
You tryna kill yourself?
Go ahead and just die
Cause I love being dead
Now I’m saying goodbye
Bitch

[Hook]
So Lonely
Sippin’ on 40s
Cause I have nobody
Fuck all these hoes
So Lonely
Sippin’ on 40s
Cause I have nobody
Fuck all these hoe

[Outro]
Aye, this to all our ex's, not just to mine, this to everybody ex's, man
Fuck all that unloyalness, man, real talk
We just want something real, man, scrub in this, scrub in this...
That's all I got, man
