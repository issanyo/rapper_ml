[Intro:]
Have you ever seen someone
That you thought was so sexy
And even though you had a man
He was still turnin' you on

[Verse 1:]
Move the feeling right
And I see you standing here
Not an ordinary night

Feeling lust is in the air
(Hey)
Way your body looks
It's turnin me on

The way you lick
Your lips slow
Makes me want you even more

[Chorus:]
Whoooooah oh oh oh oh
You're turnin' me on
Whoooooah oh oh oh oh
You're turnin' me on

[?] so attractive
Could this be wrong
To feel this way
And come on so strong

Won't take my time
'Cause you might be gone
Don't know your name
But you're turnin me on

Whoooooah oh oh oh oh
You're turnin' me on
Whoooooah oh oh oh oh
You're turnin' me on

[Verse 2:]
All alone tonight
And I left my man at home
I can't get you out my sight

I know this feeling is so wrong
(Hey)
I wanna approach you
Let you know how I feel
Wanna do more to
Try to seal this deal

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
End of the night
Can I wait for you outside
We can end this evening right

We can kick it on the side
I need to experience
What you can do
We'll have a private party
For just me and you

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
First time I ever been so
Attracted to a stranger
Don't know if this is wrong but

Dont mind if in a danger
You caught my eye
Minute that I saw you
Knowing that [?]

Wanna get to know you
Can I get your name
Making me say
(You're turnin' me on)

Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey

Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey

[Repeat Chorus:]
