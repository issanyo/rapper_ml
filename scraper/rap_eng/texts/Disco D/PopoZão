[Bridge:]
Toy yoyo thang on me, baby
Toy yoyo thang on me
Toy yoyo thang on me, baby
Toy yoyo thang on me

That genius I do shout, I'm just singing Popozão
That genius I do shout, I'm just singing Popozão

In Portuguese it means “bring your ass”
On the floor, and move it real fast
I want to see a kitty with a little bit of titty –
Want to know, where I go, when I’m in the city?

Girl, don’t you worry about all the dough
Because a cat is coming straight out of the "NO"
Ready to rock those shows on the Wario
Bring that Brazil booty on the floor

Up, down, all around:
Work that shit with this funky sound
Gonna see where I’m going, oh?
I've just send that Popozão

Po, Po, Po, Po, Popozão, Popozão
Po, Po, Po, Po, Popozão, Popozão
Po, Po, Po, Po, Popozão, Popozão

That genius I do shout, I'm just singing Popozão
That genius I do shot, I'm just singing Popozão

Po, Po, Po, Po, Popozão, Popozão
Po, Po, Po, Po, Popozão, Popozão
Po, Po, Po, Po, Popozão, Popozão

[Bridge]
Toy yoyo thang on me, baby
Toy yoyo thang on me
Toy yoyo thang on me, baby
Toy yoyo thang on me

[repeat Chorus & bridge fading in each other]

I wanna see some Popozão!!

[Chorus:]
Po, Po, Po, Po, Popozão, Popozão
Po, Po, Po, Po, Popozão, Popozão
Po, Po, Po, Po, Popozão, Popozão
Po, Po, Po, Po, Popozão, Popozão

[Bridge 2×]
Toy yoyo thang on me, baby
Toy yoyo thang on me
Toy yoyo thang on me, baby
Toy yoyo thang on me
Toy yoyo thang on me, baby
Toy yoyo thang on me
Toy yoyo thang on me, baby
Toy yoyo thang on me
