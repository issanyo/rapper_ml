[Intro]
(One, two
One, one, two
One, one, one, two
One, one, two
One, one, two
One, two, three
One, two, three, owww)

[Hook: Goapele]
You can go to the jungle
Go to the city
Visit Soweto
Live in the Bay or
Somewhere in between
But you'll never be unseen
Go to the jungle
Go to the city
Visit Soweto
Live in the Bay or
Somewhere in between
'Cause you'll never be unseen

[Verse 1: Pep Love]
Unhh
Now this is how it is
We try to handle biz
And make moves in this land where the power lives
Where they devour kids
And acts of cowardice rule from a tool of violence and a shrouded bliss
I try to release my malice
And develop my inner peace in a place so callous
Maybe I'll go to Angola or other Gold Coasts
And blow smoke with the old folks 'cause they know most

[Verse 2: Tajai]
Capture the cultured pearls, jewels, and gems
It's a treasure hunt to stimulate your medulla stem
The furthest reaches are within your clutches
Concrete covered countries to the most birded regions
Virgin territories, those exposed to man made woes
They know them Hieros
Electrified with lectures, collect respect and ride on
Before you even know this I'm gone (no)

[Verse 3: Cas]
Go to Saigon, Singapore, Sicily
They consider me epitome in Italy (that's right)
Hit Libya, India, Morocco
Or go to Oakland and hit the eight deuce block dough
Chicago, Liberia, Nigeria
'Frisco's cold like Siberia
The list goes on
Portugal to Spain
Maine, San Juan, Guam, or San Luis Obispo

[Hook: Goapele]
You can go to the jungle
Go to the city
Visit Soweto
Live in the Bay or
Somewhere in between
But you'll never be unseen
Go to the jungle
Go to the city
Visit Soweto
Live in the Bay or
Somewhere in between
'Cause you'll never be unseen

[Verse 4: Del]
I don't know dog
Maybe it's just me
But I feel I'm clutching
To hold nothing
I mean bluffing
I got the poker face
I don't really know my place
And I never chose this way
So I go astray
Throw aways blow away
Every hope I hold today
We were sold as slaves
The sky is cold and grey
My niggas showed the way
So fan and listen now with this
I see my golden age

[Verse 5: A-Plus]
Unhh
Time zone travellin'
Boundary crossin'
Now we talkin'
Worldwide, now we cost em'
Fo' sho' partner I'm a globetrotter
Downing shots of gold slaga'
Smokin' like a 'O' roster
I've flown lots of places in a Continental
Every spot we've been to
We monumental
We rock the venue like we dropped a missile
But it ain't an attack
That's why the people keep on bringing us back, feel that
(One, two, three)

[Verse 6: Opio]
I didn't tap a belly
Still I'm lovin' Makaveli
Trying to reach the pinnacle
And we will, so be ready
Said we jetty
I've never stolen energy
Combined with visionary minds so we itchin' to blow
Like a Dirty Harry trigger finger
With a needle quicker than my Pilipino homies on the two turntables
See the truth enables sight through your damaged cornea
We got the formula from Oakland California
(One, two, three)

[Hook: Goapele]
Go to the jungle
Go to the city
Visit Soweto
Live in the Bay or
Somewhere in between
'Cause you'll never be unseen

Go to the jungle
Go to the city
Visit Soweto
Live in the Bay or
Somewhere in between
'Cause you'll never be unseen
