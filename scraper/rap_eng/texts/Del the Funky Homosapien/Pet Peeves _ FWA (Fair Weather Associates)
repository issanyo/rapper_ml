We all know FWA's, how they lay
Cause they figure if you're bumpin the pays
In the long run, and it's all fun in their eyes
They must be on one how, they prepare lies
Get up close make you think, you the host of the ceremonies
Why you ain't peepin like a doggy mark his territory
They're never there for me when I need a little boost
Because of who you are, they can get a little juice
Then they like to seemingly leans up on your shoulders
Otherwise he's steppin on toes gettin over
Flappin his molars talkin 'bout he owe you
And every time he smoke, he don't show you no love
And be the first fool with his lips on the blunt
If he persists to front I'mma commenced to dump
Be careful when you make a little something that's yours
Cause a lot of these predators want yours to be theirs
Or at least own a share just by bein there
I be on some hermit skit, and fools think I'm square now
There's an interesting way to look at it
I look at them as bein fake, the way they took advantage
Speaking on the crooks of the planet, who claim they got game
Yeah you the game and they the hunter; just one more
