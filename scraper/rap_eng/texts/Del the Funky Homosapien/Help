[Intro: Female [?]]
Del and Amp Live
Welcome you into the light
The light, the light

[Verse 1: Del]
I strike the empire back, give the enemy action
The force ain't with you, is against you, we hit 'em with blasters
But my hand solo, fly like Millennium Falcon, breach the death star, They defences is really what's crackin', really what's crackin'
I make it happen tonight, whoop an ass
Then the want to shake hands after the fight
Rappers act to good for rap because they ain't actually nice
Believe in they own hype, act like they practically nine
Too simplistic
You see we futuristic, we introduce the system
Got the computer trippin', confuse the niggas
They don't know what to do, bring 'em down to earth
Ain't no one looking up to you, ain't nothing new

[Chorus]
Help
It was too long, it was all wrong, now you beyond
It was too long, it was all wrong, now you beyond
Now you beyond
Help

[Verse 2]
And time will tell why they design to fail
Tryin' to spy and snoop, keep an eye on yo self
They blind as hell thinking they blazin' trail
Smelling like burning trash, so they should fry in hell
They get the foot in the door, I'ma slam it shut
Tryna break they ankle, thank you, don't try to cut
You stay in line, you wait in line
Take a number, be patient, don't blame the line
Don't blame the game, ain't nothin' wrong with the game
Acting like you anybody, somebody wantin' the game
Squeeze the circle in the square, you don't belong in the game
To keep it funky, really you be what's wrong with the game

[Chorus]
Help
It was too long, it was all wrong, now you beyond
It was too long, it was all wrong, now you beyond
Now you beyond
Help
