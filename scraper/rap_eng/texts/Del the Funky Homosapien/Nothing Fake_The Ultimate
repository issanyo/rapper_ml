C'mon... {*echoes*}
C'mon now

[Del the Funky Homosapien]
Don't believe what they tellin you
About me and Plee ya see that we illustrious
Flames you can't douse or doubt
You know we came to turn this motherfucker out
See - everythang fo' what it really is, still feelin big
At our expense, as scarred against our excellence
Excalibur with which I done blurred a thousand words
Whittle 'em down to about a third
They got - nerve, loudmouths, they birdbrains, they ain't knowin
Plee and Tajai, tch, rhymin since the third grade
Back then niggas called it a nerd game
Now they sit on the curb tryin to learn game, earn fame
But we from the O, that's why, we let 'em know
The thangs to be up out, plus we want the flow
For the people here, equal share
Yeah they treat us fair, cause we speak with care
About all y'all

[Hook: Del]
I know you and you know me
And somebody told me that we O.G.'s
So if you feel that then shake and bake
Cause my nigga A Plus ain't nothin fake
I know you and you know me
And, somebody told me that we O.G.'s
So if you feel that shake and bake
Cause my boy A Plee ain't nuttin fake

{*record scratches off needle*}
"Awwwwwwwwww shit." "Wasn't my fault y'knahmsayin?"
"I hear you~!"

This one feel good Plee
Let's do it

Hieroglyphics mayne, we the ultimate
Gettin dough don't quit, and if we in it we on it
It's on from the beginnin, my niggas is winnin
In the zone and we inchin in for dollars quarters and pennies
We got plenty, and we fin' ta be
"2005 'Til Infinity" my live niggas feelin me
We drop toxic hot shit
And make hip-hop, skip to the rhythm for profit
Bitches on the dick, they love Hieroglyphics
White girls, latinas, asians and black chicks
Act a fool, break a rule, get your paper dude
I'm on point cause if I make a mistake I lose
Truth spitter, you shoulda knew
When I blew through the roof with a blueprint of new
And improvin abusin the rules, we hit 'em and get 'em confused
By my many tentacles when accused of contradictin myself
Get off of my dick and excel in your own right
Then quicken your step to the next lev-el
We XXL and do it big as the planet now let's get this mail
Yeah

"Strange isn't the word for it"
