[Verse 1: Def3]
Almost everywhere I go I see somebody I know
And I ain't even tryna brag it's just the way it is though
Not saying it's all bad, in fact, it's kinda dope
Knowing people got your back is what allows you to grow
I travel 'round the globe, rhythm I romanticize
And get around so my fanbase amplifies
Sometimes I can't deny how small this world really is
Like running into a homie overseas on some biz'
And I don't believe in coincidence, man
Everything happens for a reason as a part of a plan
And you can choose your own adventure, turn the chapter [?]
It's those make or break moments that we'll never understand
It's how you play that hand that you were given regardless
Process and catharsis controlling your subconscious
It's nonsense to ever play the game as a pawn
Cause this planet's only as big as the circle you've drawn

[Chorus: Black Thought (scratched by The Gaff)]
Somebody told me that this planet was small
Somebody told me that this planet was small
Somebody told me that this planet was small
Somebody told me that this planet was small

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Well, well, fancy meeting you here
Good, 'cause you finna be impressed when you hear
Flow, words, signify the truth here
They say it ain't closed case 'cause the proof is
Small world, [?]
Poppa got the blues ain't much room when you first
Warn NASA 'cause I'm kicking up dirt
Blast off, then I hit the astroturf
Rap is cursed but I got the cure
I'm sick, need to be quarantined, doctor's words
Big mouths, what the fuck they talking for
When I'm going all out like I ain't got no more
If you need help then my team can coach ya
Come next door neighbor, we can bring ya closer
To those off base, it may seem insulting
'Cause when you full of bull, it results in more shit
Funk pimping, I bring it to you
Close range 'cause that's just the thing to do
Get at me

[Chorus: Black Thought (scratched by The Gaff)]
Somebody told me that this planet was small
Somebody told me that this planet was small
Somebody told me that this planet was small
Somebody told me that this planet was small

[Verse 3: Moka Only]
Yeah, it's Moka O, Kareem Serene, check it out, uh
Somebody told me that in order to be holy
Gotta think like [?] no need to play the goalie
Just keep yourself open to the world in which you're rolling
And it's a small ball [?]
My yes, yes y'all keeps you all involved
Good morning Berlin, thanks for making the call
And peace to Def3-zie and my man Sir Deezie
We been weaving a tapestry and made it look easy
But nobody saw the years of sweat, tears and greasy
Promoters and cold shoulders, another fire smolders
Another mic broken, another trip to [?]
Now that I'm older, gotta watch that composure
And word travels fast when you sipping on your [?]
Of Minnesota with my mind stuck in [?]
Back to Pensylvania to pencil in the days
For credentials in Romania, my people been my saviors, yeah

[Chorus: Black Thought (scratched by The Gaff)]
Somebody told me that this planet was small
Somebody told me that this planet was small
Somebody told me that this planet was small
Somebody told me that this planet was small
