[Intro]
Yeah, I'm just gonna apply a little bit of pressure, you know. Cause you know, you know, you buster, you know. I'mma slap the shit out of you. Yo, this is for that, this is for the, this is for the motherfuckers that needs that real shit. You know what I'm saying? That real, real shit. Ain't got it in a while. And I'm putting some pressure on you. Just to let you know

[Verse 1]
So glossy, ain't no wrinkles
Make chucks maneuver quick, but they think slow
Sir Dzl, customers putting down
When I knock the structure over with the ruckus
Funks the order of the show, my pleasure
Apply pressure, collect dollars for the effort
I kick the stuff that matters with no slack
Hitting punks with twice the steel [?] format
I'm bad, but terrific
That's why I keep shitting on my funk exhibition
Please brothers with quality entertainment
Straight from the nuggets, you gon' love the innovation
It's a doozy, fools can't do me
They get mad and moody, but stop that tom foolery
Fuck the bullshit, the rugged hit the highway
Doing 150, they can't find the trace

[Hook] x3
Smooth and sequential, the mental fitness
More bars, no pause, roll hard
Smooth and sequential, the mental fitness
Striking colors, hold mics with wonder

[Verse 2]
Good condition, it couldn't be different
I utilize my wisdom to flip the system
Yo, I'm cautious, my taste is a cut above
Cool in demand, stay busy, I love the buzz
Fools with the hokey pokey rhymes in their songs
I ain't hating, but my matrix be a step beyond
Dips quiet like avoiding the scene
While stars hit the news flash doing stupid things
Stay in tune with these, see what the future brings
Blast and zap and sting all underlings
And tow these flows, oh I'm gonna OD
Overkill road and skill, they can't coach me
Kick the slick talking, walk with a pitchfork
Suckers left hanging low plus they get scorched
You dig or you don't, I can't help you
Better do the knowledge and know yourself too

[Hook]
