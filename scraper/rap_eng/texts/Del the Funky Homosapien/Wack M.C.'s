[Intro]
You WACK M.C.'s!
This a dedication to you WACK M.C.'s
This is a dedication to you WACK M.C.'s
And you're history...huh...
You WACK M.C.'s!
This a dedication to you WACK M.C.'s
This is a dedication to you WACK M.C.'s
And you're history

[Verse 1]
What a jerk! You need to find rhymes that'll work
You need to desert the rhymin' field
You're a nerd, your rhymin' yields and stops
My rhymin' shield deflects your puny rhymes
They're 'spect so do decline - any challenge
Forfeit because your shit's - unbearable, terrible
Sounds like you're sharing flows with Treach
Let's come to grips youse a drip
Arrogant son of a bitch, none of us is rich
This is my stitch in time, enrichin' minds
And twistin' backs witcha simplistic raps
I let a little bit of my lyrics leak and lather
At my mouth like a mad dog
And seek and gather your neck and bite
I just dissect the mic
And correct the tykes so don't be sassy
You won't be lasting, chastising that's why things
Swing in my favor - watch your behavior!

[Hook]
I cannot stand a WACK M.C
So step back if you please
And don't test me, you're history
I cannot stand a WACK M.C
So step back if you please
And don't test me, you're history
[Wack emcees - your time is up!
How many punks must I kill (kill)
Wack emcees - your time is up!
How many punks must I kill (kill)
Wack emcees - your time is up!
How many punks must I kill (kill)
Wack emcees - your time is up!
How many punks must I kill (kill)]

[Verse 2]
I cannot stand a WACK M.C
So step back if you please
And don't test me, you're history
I cannot stand a WACK M.C
So step back if you please
And don't test me, you're history
You're jealous, overzealous, Del is spectacular
In fact, you are wack and far beyond dope, be goneâ€”NOPE!
You gets no respect, I pose a threat
'Cause you're wack and weak, in fact you tried to freak
"Groove Me", it was used before
You need to choose a more appealing sample
I seal and stamp fools like mail, you're quite stale
You might fail and I know you're paranoid
Beware, avoid Funky Homosapien
Monkeys I will make of men
Take 'em into custody your style is rus-ty!
Plus we, hate R&B, 'cause that shit is sorry
That shit's for saps, just admit your raps
Don't cut the mustard, don't get flustered
'Cause ya, skill is null and void
And your skull is void, empty
Senseless, defenseless, I rinse this
Plague away with typhoons and you die soon
Why swoon when you hear a ballad, is what I tell a broad
'Cause L a fraud, he ain't hella hard
I used to look up, now I wanna cook up
Your brain like bass and maintain ya space
'CAUSE I DON'T CARE!

[Hook]
I cannot stand a WACK M.C
So step back if you please
And don't test me, you're history
I cannot stand a WACK M.C
So stand back if you please
And don't test me, you're history
[Wack emcees - your time is up!
How many punks must I kill (kill)
Wack emcees - your time is up!
How many punks must I kill (kill)
Wack emcees - your time is up!
How many punks must I kill (kill)
Wack emcees - your time is up!
How many punks must I kill (kill)]
