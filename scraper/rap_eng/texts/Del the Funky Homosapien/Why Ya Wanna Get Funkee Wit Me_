A new day was dawning
Yes one more morning
Just stretching and yawning
Picked up my belongings
And call my crew
See what we all can do
Let's go to the mall
The one with the waterfall
And take your father's car
Although it ain't that far
They got a whole bazaar
Of fly girls up the par
Yeah sounds like a plan
I need a new Walkman
We pass the popcorn stand
And see what we can land
In the land no less
I spot a cutie with Guess
And I had on sweats
She looked unimpressed
I said "Damn you fine"
But nothing 'bout her behind
I said "Do you have the time, to sit back and chitchat?"
She said "No
You look like a hobo
And with that camouflage shit looking like G I Joe"
I said "I'm not that broke
And I can buy you a Coke"
She said "This must be a joke"
I swear it hurt till she soaked, and shook me off
Like a moth
I said "What's the deal with the clothing as long as it's cloth?"

[Hook]
Why you wanna get funky wit me?
Slow ya roll a little
Damn you crazy
Girl, why you wanna get funky wit me?
Slow ya roll a little
Damn you crazy
Girl, why you wanna get funky wit me?
Slow ya roll a little
Damn you crazy

Ok she too stuck up
I didn't catch so what?
My partners busting their gut
Getting me straight stuck, on anger
Let her go
Why sweat her so?
Oh fuck you guys
Let's fuck with some fries
At Quick Stop
Where the chicks pop, up
Let's pop at them
Nigga like a magnum
Next destination
Stop at the gas station
My heart started racing
Saw this cutie who way thin
I stalk like Jason
With no authorization
I looked her in her face and asked her how her day went
And her digits
She said "what is this?
It's none of your business"
I'm shorter than a midget
I fidget
Shit, she asked "why are you nervous?"
I said "your curves just amaze, they glaze my eyes over"
I told ya
She said "Are you sober?"
Venomous like a cobra
"Don't you know that I'm older, than you
And your crew
You do what little boys do
You couldn't deal with this"
Then she sealed it with a kiss, yeah
I felt dissed, and my crew is steady laughing
And when I turn around they act like nothing had happened

Ahhhhhhh hahahahaha
Burn Del, Burn Del
That fool got clowned again man
Shot shot down
Oh here he come, Ok we out Del

Why you wanna get funky wit me?
Slow ya roll a little
Damn you crazy
Girl, Why you wanna get funky wit me?
Slow ya roll a little
Damn you crazy

Girl
Why you wanna get funky wit me?

Hieroglyphics y'all ya don't stop

We got ghost, go fries got us some girls too
The ones with the curl doo
That smell like shampoo
What's up precious?
I likes ya necklace
We doing a show tonight ya might wanna check us
She said "You're Del!" I said "I know
The one on vinyl"
And then she hit a high note
"Y'all is Hiero
And where's Pep Lover?"
I said he on the other side of town
But her partner had a frown
2 out a 3's cool, it ain't bad
She must not know how to add
She tripping and things
Each finger got rings
We 'bout to bounce like springs
But she like "Where my chicken wings?
Cutie like can you sign
This one time?
So you can be on my mind
To remind?"
I said fine
Tripping partner like "Who he?
He ain't no one"
I know him from Logan
Was now her slogan
They was jocking
She was cock blocking
They said they got the tape that keep a whole block rockin'
She said "So
Niggas with egos
What you coming out ya face for?"
I'm a let you know ho!
