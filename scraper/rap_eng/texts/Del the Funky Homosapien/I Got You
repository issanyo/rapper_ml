In my own words said you slightly drunken vertigo / Single source
Transportation to your ego / Skribble it till you skitzo or whatever /
I pop a tissue soft, keep ahead of the weather / Magic mountain
Got my head right / Step light, pop pure not a pesticide in sight /
Certified organic like I’m melanin right / You panic in a scurry /
Drop dead from the scurvy / Now I’m looking at somebody with
Grief / With omega threes and sixes,nines can’t divide we / Del do
It for the folks and such / Crappy rappers choking in the smoke
He emote / Left them with star dust, star struck face / Embrace
My feminine energy pace and clutch this / Cause I got you tight
As what, you got me?

Chorus

Del - Yo, I got you tight as what, you got me?
Mecca - Yes, I got you tight as what, you got me?
Del - Yo, I got you tight as what, you got me?
Mecca - Yes, I got you tight as what, you got me?
Del - Yo, I got you tight as what, you got me?
Mecca - Yes, I got you tight as what, you got me?
Del - Yo, I got you tight as what, you got me?
Mecca - Yes, I got you tight as what, you got me?

Del - Ho!! If you really want to get it, you know we gotta do it
Together, yes we gotta do it together
If you really want to get it, you know we gotta get it together, yes
We gotta get it together, Yes we...

Del

With my own words send you further backwards/ Tractor beams
Catcha backhand the pastor / That’s blasphemous well who the
Hell asked you / Mecca’s whole directive is to hand down the
Chapter / I’m flying off the rafters / Silencers and magnums /No
Not handguns markers for taggin / Barnstorming your coordinates
Like dragons / Fuck who your fam is / They famish from famine / I
Love to see that / I’m off the meat rack / I kick my feet back and
Listen to the beat slap / Mecca got your teeth wrapped around her
Kneecap / Trying to beat that / Rocks beat scissors, scissors
Beats paper, paper beat rock / We got you in the box, like a fiend
In detox / Rebelling against the empire like the Ewoks

Mecca

I got them under the lights to drop heat / That night she quietly
Stole the great ease and the crowd was pleased / Still reeling
From the shock we brought / Preserve love for the art / Poured
Love from the heart / Eyes stole in the shocked crowd

Del

You know our plot ties in with the rockslide / Stopping Apartheid /
Freedom will reign in the brain with unity / Funk will flow through
The veins / Then bring the change and arrange this passing for
Forever raising the bar / Praising Allah first / Hit you with a raw
Verse doing yard work / Seeing how it all works / The time has
Come for the rising sun / Don’t look any further / Cause I’m the
One, be to the 2 / I got you tight as what / You got me?

Chorus

Mecca - Yes, I got you tight as what, you got me?
Del - Yo, I got you tight as what, you got me?
Mecca - Yes, I got you tight as what, you got me?
Del - You know I got you tight as what, you got me?
Mecca - Yes, I got you tight as what, you got me?
Del - Yo, I got you tight as what, you got me?
Mecca - Yes, I got you tight as what, you got me?
Del - Yo, I got you tight as what
