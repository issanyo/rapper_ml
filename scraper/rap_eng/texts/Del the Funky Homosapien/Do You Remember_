[Refrain: Jamie Cullum]
Do you remember? Do you remember?
A time when love meant laughter
Well I am weighed down, I am so weighed down
By all these sins, I dream forever after

[Refrain: Del]
(Do you remember?) As a child how your wild imagination
Led you to great discoveries and places
(Do you remember?) Innocence in your heart
Before prejudice could spark a cold flame in the dark
(Do you remember?) How you pushed and kept pushing
Til you broke through when nobody was looking
(Do you remember?) Not to get into nostalgia
But some of those things had value

[Verse 1: Del]
How did it happen? An independent corporation
With no control could maintain it
With rebellious force, developed a course of action
We advertise, inviting all to court, the massive
A queen's faithful hand, maidens born to wealthy parents
A life of luxury, but full of scorn, yeah, they be jealous
We were omnivores, gathered food with our tongues
Peaceful, unprepared against the guns
Ever since we was young they slayed our real master
Now I'm told, blast the rifles to peel back domes
Heavy weapon power sources for confrontation
Against hot situations, safe world's invaded

[Refrain: Jamie]

[Refrain: Del]

[Verse 2: Del]
Deltron, a respected hero
Before retirement to the underground, below zero
Ceiling zero, location like limbo
With battle torn bimbos and all sorts of electric weirdos
But electrical currents run through my bars
Produces electric shock if you try to escape the bond
High voltage prods are used to control the eyes
Renew a process, erase memories of all
Like guidance and calmness suggested a new society
Unrelated to criminal acts of the high and mighty
Oppressors who contest our every motion
Controlling our emotions through hyperactive convulsions

[Refrain: Jamie x2]

[Refrain: Del]

[Verse 3: Del]
Wind the clocks back to a simpler times
Where you could talk and speak your mind
Without assault or attack or combat
All resources available in large quantities
Before the deceit and greed and privatization
Of everything that society placed inside it
Spaces as a service to the patrons
Now you pay for it and your credit better be good
Or if there's an emergency, never see a foot
Extended in your direction to help forget it
Shred any evidence of wrong doing to make pledges
Among secret societies with freaky fetishes
Lie about what's really inside, they never let us in

[Refrain: Jamie x2]
