Check it out
It's a revolution in your head I'm boosting
Like I read the future
My execution
Used as a stimulant to get you into it
Show you my sentiments
Mental leasing the flicks
Don't hate, felicitate
Whenever you get the break
It's always a risk you take
Doing a different take
Big mistake rappers make
The cake they want it now
So they copy who's the hottest now they sounding funny style
I know you're hungry pal, me too
I need food
But I don't redo what he do
I'm lethal
Like jimson root
Go ahead, attempt to shoot
Invincible
It's flawless like a dentist's tooth
Oblivious to all this ignorance
They need to get a grip
Don't be an idiot
In a high state, I transmigrate
To a fly take
Make you wanna get your life straight
I'mma introduce the places that I ventured to
I get cha proof of a hip-hop institute
It's the truth
I'm just being hospitable
Sittin' bull
The chief I seek the hidden jewels
Some just complain about the status of rap
They say it's average in fact
They wish the eighties was back
I say everything's everything
Nothing stays the same
And yet, it is the same, just given a different name
Money's all that matter to you? You sniffing 'caine
You need to uplift your brain, forget the fame
You say you get power, if you get money
How you get those if you just a dummy?

Just stay on your toes man
In this world that's just how it goes man
In Oakland, gotta get with the program
With flows I wanna control the whole land
You just gotta stay on your toes man
In this world that's just how it goes man
In Oakland, gotta get with the program
With flows I wanna control the whole land
And keep growin'

Nowadays I hear the same crap
Complain "rap is trendy" not to give anybody with a name dap
When did that start?
It sound childish
You went to college but I think you need some extra mileage
Underground cats disrespect who they don't listen to
If you looked at my CD rack you'd probably diss me to
That's so weak
Don't speak when a niggarole creep
Or I'm finna go deep
I heard a MC in a cipher straight lying
Damn near crying, talking 'bout "real Hip-Hop's dying"
That's some dumb shit!
That's what I was thinking (Uh-huh)
But I didn't say nothing to him cause I knew that I been drinking
He must be blind as hell
Hip-Hop is alive and well
He ain't got the mind to tell
I rhyme with Del
Drink Guiness combined with Ale
Never been inclined to fail, applyin' the skill
I be tryin' to build with the close-minded
But they so blinded I get upset and they get clothes-lined
Don't hate on nobody
Stay on your toes
Even if he got platinum or gold on him
Stay on your toes
Underground to Commercial cat
Stay on your toes
I know them or I ain't heard of that
Stay on your toes
From backpacks and licorice sticks
To black macs with ammunition and clips
Man I can get with this shit
Yeah, it's all the same
Some of y'all call it game
Say it's either for the props or the fame and all the change
Use what you call your brain
The whole aim
Home on the range
Just stay out my lane
