[Verse 1: Del]
Straight from the gate, I’m gassin’
Dribblin’, not from glasses
Hackin’, I’m not gon’ pass
Foul, get an elbow to match it
Settle the racket, sit at the bottom and lay
Just like the ship in a bottle, that’s the model they face
Never satisfied but that ain’t my problem at all
Next time you scream in my ear I’ma holla at y’all
Funk Pippen, best thing is to follow the law
Or swallow your jawbone and charge it to God
(YEP) They done got me mad
That’s fine, they gon’ find a home in each bar I have
Fuck they demands, tell the hostages
That’s too much to give up, I don’t want ‘em then
I’m calmer then, that’s the stormy weather
That’s when I rain on you poor little ornery beggars
Fisticuffs just ain’t the move
They too feeble, get a gun for safety use

[Verse 2: Del]
They off a little
It’s like trading a yacht for a box of Skittles
It’s not no riddle, I don’t joke around
Why, when it’s so many jokers to go around?
Choose one, new sons, who’s dumb
Actions get ‘em slapped so tough they IQ grew some
Funk Pippen the legendary
Fuck treasure, X marks the spot where heads is buried
The cemetery but without a body
Detached just like a bat defiled by Ozzy
I don’t know why I put up with fools
They feel they indestructible but self-combustible
In other words, they the enemy within
Get incinerated whenever they finna be a bitch
They got something to say, then let it be known
They got a bone to pick, I prefer breaking bones
I know some kung-fu
Tiger style, crane style, they gon’ get pummeled
Down, down, left, left punch
That shit’s fire all around, send ‘em jettison
Floatin’ away—now where they go?
Laser scope be sure to spot Waldo
I bomb hoe ass niggas and leave ‘em scorchin’
Grand prize, nothing, fuckin’ with the Wheel of Fortune
