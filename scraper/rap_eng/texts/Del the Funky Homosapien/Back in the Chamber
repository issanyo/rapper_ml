D, he back in the chamber / Packing the tainted, Black entertainment back with a vengeance / Slapping you midgets acting suspicious / The macking is vicious / vernacular spectacular rapping all the time / It’s relaxing on the mind / Peace is the word but I’ll beast on a bird trying to feast and splurge/ Put them feet to the curb as soon as you get out my bathroom / And I’m calling a cab too / D ain’t that dude / Close your mouth hoes is out / In the cold without no clothes, no house, no holding me back / I told you when I get to blow she a wrap, excuse my language / But they play a game which leaves folks open to any tricks she hoping to get to work / Anything better than to hit the turf / Sucking dicks for work had a straw and skirt she bezerk

Del ad-lib

Chorus

You really naughty and you think you awfully foxy
All the stunts that you pull is rather shocking
Go ahead and cock me back in the chamber
You see me weave through the drama and the danger
You do things that momma is ashamed of
Name one nigga who gonna save you? Ain’t none

You really naughty and you think you awfully foxy
All the stunts that you pull is rather shocking
Go ahead and cock me back in the chamber
You see me weave through the drama and the danger

Whoo, Diesel back in the chamber cross a bitch off a dame hopeful for a bank roll / Ain’t no nigga civilized enough to rise above the count that slick / Mount a bitch, clowned a bitch, looking astounded while they surround the bitch / Oopsy I’m out the loopsy that’s just how it is / I don’t crowd the wig with tales about how you jerks turn out them dears / I’m about my peers and pixels / Trick hoes always try to stir my mix though / Nah uh, not off herbs and Cisco brought the shit back but big tho / Now dig ho, keep your lid shut about my nabisco / Or you going to get a clip thrown into your hip bone / I got them photographs of you hoeing ass / Getting fucked slow and fast / Blowing hash / Yeah, that hoe was fast but I’m Flash Gordon snorting, I’m sharper than a porn tip

What you laughing for bitch, i don’t see nothing funny, sucka
