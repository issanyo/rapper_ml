Full of cobras, yolla, dosia stands
Soldiers roll as hoes come to hold your hand
What they told ya is bogus, motive scams
Payola for motorolas and coco plants
Ask the bitch why you attracted to a older man
If you play you better know your hand
They be po-po fans, loco in the cabeza
Possessive, no questions
Hoe sexes for yo necklace
Self esteem low, pimps get the green dough
Extreme show of gratitude for slapping you
I’ma rapper with actual facts for you
Look at that, that’s what crack will do, zappin fools
Make the most attractive boo turn transient
Lost in the ambience pantiless, scantily dressed
She like give me a kiss, for pimps
With a pantry of flesh for your cash but it can’t be a check

Chorus

Niggas be so damn slow man, I told them man
No one’s gonna hold your hand
I don’t know why niggas be so damn slow man
I told them man
No one’s gonna hold your hand
I don’t why niggas be so damn slow man, I told them man
No one’s gonna hold yo hand
I don’t know why niggas be so damn slow man

I ain’t mesmerized by a pleasure promise with lies
It won’t twist my brain if a bitch complain
I’ma analyze wisely the situations
See if shit you saying is warranted
If so, I’ll more than give my all to correct any flaws
But if you in denial, bye hoe
I can’t hold your hand, you’re too old for that
I don’t know them cats, should I order straps?
She’ll be blowing sacks
But you owe’m scratch and it's extra weed
And niggas trying to threaten me
Why they sweating me?
I even let them eat, now they wanna catch me sleep
Fat chance, now my hands is holding
Ammo loaded slamming voltage to shock
Einstein's when the fine line is crossed
A blind mind with thoughts too real to concoct
That’s them, action make something happen

Chorus (repeats multiple times then fades out)
