[Verse 1: Tame One]
When I get amped off plants, it's mad graphic to the masses
Slapping chicks on they asses, mixin' illy with hashes
Dumping the pills, Scarface in the [?] twice
[?] and sip gin to feel nice
Blasted off of triple-dip, acid and cough syrup
Nod out, waking up every four minutes
[?] mixed until I earl
Think it was school how I mixed boy with the girl
I be looking at the world through slits
Fucked up, not giving two shits
Smelling like burning embalming fluid
Leaked up, geeked up, drunk off painkillers
Getting raw shivers, like cocaine sniffers
Can't sleep, grinding my teeth
Smoke anything I can [?]
Running out in the street
My [?] system got doctors like damn
Giving me piss tests to measure grams
But be above average, I'm a savage
Bananas with my [?] pamphlets
With a Jesus piece, bling, bling
I start [?] niggas
Them boujee  snot-nose bitches
I rap with candid cameras they still can't catch us
Break off eight of the ten commandments
Until then I'm having cigarettes bragging about
What happened with this bitch just last week

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Ya I be if I was knee deep in the harry dugout
I pulled the plug out, she was bugged out
Wanted a nigga to thug her out
That's all she respected
I told her bitch get outta pocket and the shit getting corrected
She bring me a line for breakfast
Yeah, sniffed a bit and lifted off
On the strip to get some more fundings for my run-ins
I bring underlings
Goons who ain't groomed to be in tune with the status quo
Matter of fact, I'll have you know
They bread the battered skulls
Take your block, they wake with plots, mapped by the [?]
Smoking a roach and sippin' some tequila
The patron, in zone, I really feel it, wheeling and dealing
Come and get your order like Mickey D's, by the trees
No pennies, got [?] plus bennies and plenty
Fuck five-O they can't get me
I'm sitting pretty in a bucket
With two chickens who trick and suck dick
Corruption on the corner, can't trust it like [?]
Hoes got [?], it's dark and creepy
I inhale trees deeply to keep me calmer
Bomb on niggas coming short on my product
All up in the mix, ten to six, getting rich
Plus the benefits up outta the bitch
Counting my grip, staying low
And avoiding anybody noticing the mode I'm in
Rock' and rollin', holding it down. patrollin' my rounds
And drinking patron 'til I drown in [?] spilling
