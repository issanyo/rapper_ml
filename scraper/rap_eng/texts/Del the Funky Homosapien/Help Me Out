Back, Del impetuous
Tempestuous
Bust flows impervious
Under fire like asbestos
All MCs grip my testicles
Let them go
No, I spread your flow like metal pull
Utensils such as scalpels
Over your Adam's Apple
To make you alto
Doggin' MCs and feed 'em Alpo
Your plan backfires to my satires
Got your flow sittin' on flat tires
My roguish rhymes rip through your lip when you bite
Like a lightnin' bolt, for a volt of molten mic
Hazardous to the average
Volt and death strike
To your neck right
On target
Bull's eye
Then deflected off your neck with such velocity
It's sets the hip hop hostage free
In the terminal burnin' all MC's brains
Accelerated agents got you walkin' on canes
I'll be brief like Hanes
Mundane MCs get caned to retain my title
The vital organ donor
To cut through the bologna
My escapades let you wave through the masquerade
Rain with disaster man out in your play book
Cause they took
The funk merged with hate
And then regurgitate
This concludes part of what causes murder rates to bubble
Meanwhile I take the shuttle to this girls crib so we can cuddle
And listen to my subtle rebuttals to butthole

Hook:
Words and phrases I prefer to play with
What occurs when I made it
Is never outdated
Help me out (x2)

Verse 2:
I stifle your mic hold your grips slips don't bet all your chips
Thrown away all your tips for thinkin'
That's dangerous
Leave that to the big boys
Sicker than Sig Freud
Peep, you wanna live forever but take too many chances
You with many can get a piece of Eastside Oakland folks
When provokin' spoken dialects of broken English
That distinguish us from y'all
We cause shots at all spots on the globe
And disrobe your mode of mediocrity like Socrates
My Egyptian inscription's shiftin'
Brain cells with sick afflictions
Suckas must be simpin'
Hop like Lipton
You'll get the microphone when I'm though if then
I formed a rapport with my siblings
The sort of thing that keep the crew tight
Even in it's new life
You think you're able to label the Hiero sound?
You still haven't found a comparable variable
I aim my flows they close in like smart bombs
Bury ya, restricted areas
Me and my playmates, we talented hip-hop paladins
Paddling the charlatans
Knowing what we are to them
Makes us try hard to win
We attend the track promptly
Rappers wanna chomp me
They empty
I'm mega morph with mega force don't fort deceit the beat
It's a treat
A peak at the war on the weak

Hook

Verse 3:
Del carelessly cavorting
Over more things than tracks
Your skulls perhaps
Spinal taps, vinyl lapse over each other you'll discover
Soon enough how tough it is to scruff them bids
At auctions I'm lost in madness
Lackadaisical but coming back to fade you all
I don't make music for the teeny boppers
The coppers and proper bourgeois
Y'all can lose me
Or find me but keep in mind we
Underground when you get offended
As you often do when you newcomers
Check the rap scene for a few summers
Then when it change you shift lanes
But first you mergin'
First you was a virgin splurgin' money on P.E
Then with N.W.A
But too much trouble to play
Mom on your ass turn that trash down
Your little brother getting' bright ideas in the background
He use to war Hush Puppies
Now he and his homies is dust junkies sellin' crack cross country
Use to be a momma's boy
Now you a grown man with no plan
All alone in the land of the free and the home of the brave
Free to be your own mental slave
Del has to have a word with you
Because you deserve to do what you want to
But mistakes come back to haunt you

Hook (x2)
