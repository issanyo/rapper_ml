Yo, stacking chips / Cracking whips / Back in this, sonofabitch /
Punish you if / You coming to get some of chips / I summons a
Blitz / Running the streets / Tongue in cheek / Pummeling beats /
Tunneling freaks / Feel me black / I really rap / Conceal the trap /
I deal the pack / Going gone / Growing long / Loaded arm
Throwing bombs / I found the answers / Designed the chapters /
I’m someone who knows I run the show

Chorus (repeat 2x)

Working it, exerting it, you’re it now fully immersed in it
Working it, murking it, make sure you get what you want from it

I state the claim / I break the chains / But show no shame /
Cause I know the game /fools know I’m sane / But got a loaded
Brain / So I leave a solders stain / When I flow some game / I
Totally mame / Throw on a rotary exchange / Exposing the
Change / I know when to feign / Motive is anger, I’m holding those
Same words / Unload’em on paper /Niggas float into vapor /
Promoting the caper you soak in the lake / Hatred, I take it back
To basics / Lace my kicks I always knew I would make it stick / I
Let it ease up off an immediate I can see the cliff / I make beats
That rip / Plus Freak the shit out a geeky bitch/ let them eat the
Strip / I’m completely here /now I want ya’ll to groove and move your
Feet to this

Chorus (repeat 2x)

Working it, exerting it, you’re it now fully immersed in it
Working it, murking it, make sure you get what you work from it

This is how I take it / Dish it out then take it / This is about no
Paper / It’s about my patience / I don’t twiddle my thumbs / I
Know how to make it jump off / I don’t promote tough talk / I do
What I do / I win and you lose / Trying to put it in your two / I don’t
Listen to fools / Misconstrue the truth and all logic / You think your all
That but, I think not / Yo, I lay further back to puff starters and
Parkas and troop jackets / Niggas will shoot at’cha, I’m a real
Dude / So I feel you / Show you a ill view / Always build new
Structures to touch you / I pump substance / Always up to
Something, but no frontin’

Chorus

Working it, exerting it, you’re it now fully immersed in it
Working it, murking it, make sure you get what you work from it
(Repeat 3x)

Working it, exerting it, you’re it, now fully immersed in it
Fully immersed in it, I said your fully immersed in it, fully
Immersed in it
