[Verse 1: Psalm One]
I got my carbonated water, syrup, vodka
Shoes tied up, corset on proper
I’m going at the town like I just got outta hell
Or I just got outta jail and I just made bail
Streets on siz, hustlas on the slab
Walkers walking often, the cutty on yo tab
What I need that for, I got extra biz
Don't need too many posers or them hep-ster kids
I ain't discriminating, my taste already there
Gotta fetish for the lettuce, a front row chair
Nuggy nugs in the O2, oh you gotta friend
Tell him bring another bag or he ain't getting in
See I ain't coming out less it's funner than a mug
I run tings well, I got some mothers on my drugs
And some nuns on my doctrine, doctors on my table
A spread at my pad and some hot ones in my stable

[Refrain x2]
I ain't coming out without a guaranteed time
I ain't getting down without a guaranteed grind
I'm a hermit with a permit, I party when it's right
Cause I live inside a party and it's hard to top mine

[Verse 2: Del tha Funky Homosapien]
They call me a hermit, tell the truth I heard worse words spit
Out the mouths of babes with mentally challenged ways
The countdown is days and they don't know it yet
Slo-mo effect, go into debt
Showboating cash flow, rowboat with regret
To the island of Never Never Land, I gotta better plan
Instead of going out to clubs and spending
My personal maintenance be my priority agenda
See I work at home, I had to earn it though
Getting jerked to and fro, I had enough though
Every time you leave the tilt, everything cost
I sat down for a moment and seen the loss
Plus my gig also keep me from the crib
For so long I damn near forget where I live
I need me-time so I can think up new plots
Trying to have me a catalog of music large as 2Pac
Next time I come outside I'm gonna get it
Come back with a hundred stacks, dead Presidents
Mission accomplished, later for that nonsense
Free from negativity, I leave undaunted
B.I., Z.I., C.I. need my own destiny
Perplexing me since I was knee high
Maybe I got the game all twisted, ya’ll may be right
Wasting half your life partying until the wee night
Yeah
