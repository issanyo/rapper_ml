[Verse 1]
Diesel back to rap to y’all
Unloading a lot off my chest
No sense in holding on to it, you know
Keep it rolling
While some walk around like gimmie you owe me
Not kidding
I mean totally lost in self denial, full of bologna
So mean, always mad and loathing
Everything surrounding just soaking everybody energy up like protein
Gossiping lots of them don’t even know me
Posing fraudulating whole scenes for the viewing pleasure of those with no things to occupy themselves and keep them growing but y’all know me
I see no need to stifle yo thing especially if we homies
But if that’s the way its going be so be it
No grievance I don’t feel my soul needed

Chorus
Just situations that we go through
But you can’t let emotions control you
Foes will go and try to throw you
Cause they know it’s a way to control you
They say I’m cold, but I told you
I got goals I focus on the whole view

[Verse 2]
D-E-L ya’ll know I’m telling ya’ll it’s no beef
I be on the solo creep
Flows keep shit on the slunder but I’ma go deep, so deep below behold the whole sea
So seek, visualize and peep coral reef
That goes for those who feel they so elite
So weak about how shit’s supposed to be
Y’all dopes to me
Sit back insulting me
But you don’t get more votes than me
I outshine you don’t generate as many volts as me
Still I can cut the lights I’m low key
But that don’t stop the hoes, they nosey
You know the hoes be thinking they pussy gold, please
I told her please you chose me
To get close to me, to get dough from me
I ain’t buying it
Now you feel low and weak
Went from daddy to ignoring me
Went from ignoring me to ordering me
Uhm went from that to trying to throw with me
Now you gotta go, you can hold the streets
And your momma said no, she know more than me
So you can't go home and sleep
And D ain’t giving up dough to freak
And you know that

Chorus

Just situations that we go through
But you can’t let emotions control you
Foes will go and try to throw you
Cause they know it’s a way to control you
They sleep, they weep, below you
You can tell they emotions show through
They say I’m cold, but I told you
I got goals, I focus on the whole view (repeat 3x)
