[Intro: "Animaniacs" Sample]
"I don't know what makes that
That's why I need to you leave!
I'm very busy trying to discover a new science!"

[Verse 1: Opio]
Yeahhh, beats like this you just can't peep
It's a natural, international, not that same ol' shit
Get split in half, figuratively speakin' take a bloodbath
When I run past MC's, drop the mic like the Sunsplash
Is in Jamaica, the heart-breaka lyrics
Like a stake through your left pectoral your shit is horrible
I'm clean, like brand new Mo-Mo's on a Porsche
And your shit is sittin' on rims, let me begin
To elaborate, rings on his hands like each finger was Saturn
And the latest fashions but the same patterns
Kept flashin' up in his rap, concerned with glamorous
Tales of fatalities like he was Tarantino
The analogy is that we know that Quentin write fiction
Fantasies, woven intricately, while I'm predictin'
Every motion, them slight changes in your tone of voice
Is a toast to your parasitic choice of speak
Leakin' cold blood out the arteries if you bit
'Cause we done said it, you can't configurate
Like the great Hieroglyphics resistance we incinerate
Lit it up, now I'm finna cut
Peep the demonstration of uniqueness

[Hook: Del + Opio]
It could be fatal, wait 'til Del come back out
And act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait 'til O come back out
And act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Hurrah, here come Del to dispel the blahs
Cause and effect, pause for respect
Collection, diction friction, depictin' violence
Volatile with my profile like Molotov's
MC's must be on auto-pilot, waddle silent
Like some platypuses; Del is down with data pushers
With top secret floppy disk and battle armor and Mecha
Plus all the rhymes that I'm bangin' are double-decker, to check ya

[Verse 3: Opio]
Electri-fyin', defyin' laws of gravity (what?)
Avidly rapidly firin' lyrics, I'm shatterin'
The abdominal cavity, then I'm travellin' out the spinal
Finalizin' your paralysis on the microphone (what?)
The catalyst is the capital L-I-N-D-S-E-Y
MC's try to test but they mind gets blown

[Hook: Del + Opio]
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait 'til Del come back out
And act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait 'til O come back out
And act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts

[Verse 4: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Ain't no MC hurtin' me, matter of fact you work for me
Havoc-stricken palladiums made me numb
To anything you speak to desecrate the great Hieroglyphics
And with it goes the flows that chop egos to segments
Behind the decimal points, I point backwards
When you lack words, you toil but boil, I coil clowns
All around repellin', sellin' statues of wack groups
Statues for Hieroglyphic travellers
Any lackluster MC's, I mallet ya, right on your cranium crack
It bust your teeth through your limbs and then tip you over
If you know of Del, well then
I ill constantly with consonants, followed by nouns
And make mounds of manuscripts to whip challengers
That ain't too talented, so before I reach my destintation
Let's waste some MC's for fun (yeah)
I understand the fans needs so I feed 'em smörgåsbord
So they can gorge, and MC's can gouge they eyes out
From the teargas emitted from my tongue, leavin' fans sprung
And for the crews who high-strung, eat dung (ewww)
They just gnats and ticks, buggin' me (bzzzzzzz)
Huggin' me nuts in a cuddly clutch
My hieroglyphic theory is validated by facts
Dilated the tracks, so they wide and fat
Violated the wax, but colonized the wise words
With more enzymes ten times nutritional
Unintentional, my flows just go there, yeah

[Hook: Opio + Del]
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait 'til O come back out
And act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait 'til Del come back out
And act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait 'til Souls come back out
And act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait 'til … come back out
And act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts

[Outro: Opio + Del]
It could be fatal
Wait 'til Cas come back out
Time to scam all you MC's
Yeahhh, yeah, it could be fatal
Wait 'til Pep and Jay-Biz come back out, hahaha
You know what I'm sayin'? Just wait
