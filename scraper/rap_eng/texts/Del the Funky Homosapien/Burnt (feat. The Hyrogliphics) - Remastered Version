Del:

Mista, twista, get ya
Every single time
And I rhyme like I know
So I flow
With tha gifted tongue
An encryptic brung
New phrases into the mazes
Play this
Two times a day with a dayo
Day, eh eh yo and the daylight come
I plum forgot what a wack rhyme was
Because I buzz like a bee
In the ears of my peers
So they know and I know
We all know dayo-
Day light come and me wanna go home-
Cool
No tool
No Smith and Wesson
Just an opposite
So I can pop a bit
Of shit on the mic when I get on the mic
"p-p-p-p-ping!"
I ricochet a bit on the mic
And I like it-
Just like the Gulf or World War II
D-E-L will C-R-U and sage anyone who
Makes advances when I'm incognito gweedo
Is the answer when I prance up on ya skull like a frito
Finito
But I ain't finished
Till I let the flip side ride
Till the rhythm is diminished

Casual:

I would if I could
But I ain't cause I cain't
Time for me to lay down the law
Who's raw?
You saw the blues from the shoes of the writer
Stronger than a cisco
In ya like a cider
Watery-
Try to win the lottery before you try to slaughter me
Because I'm not the G
To be stepped to
Kept you
On ya tons
As my rep grew
I let through
Negative foes
So you better get flows to counteract what we've done
Proceed one good
Cause I'm armed like a sleeve son
Plead dumb and step back
As I rep
Shop collect
Respect drops
In debt the next prop
-artist
The hardest is the one who don't pass out
If Tyson's last name were Aphone I'd knock his ass out
The bigger the better
The better the bigger is
Whenever you figure this
N*gga is gettin' his
Be real and don't kill with flaws the ill cause
Is answer to the gods
And that's when you lost
Keep on losing
Amusing many tactics
I came to earn more green than Saint Patrick
And I make backs if you get caught frontin'
Never bought a Newport but I puff a blunt'n

Tajai:

I needs no sugar crisp
To get swift
So what with two syllables exemplifies the gift
Tajai
I sense those that try to feel my ladders
Bladders release upon your porch if you don't cease
I respond with minimal distraction
When I see one
Fatter than re-run
So what's happennin'?
It's not where you from
It's just how you come
Correct
Respect the rough neck
Is not gettin' bucked
And tucked into their beds like nighty nighty
Theft of the membrane
None left cause I'm a righty
Fight these-
You'll catch vollies for your follies
And mistakes
I stick fakes wit shanks
So no thanks
Wack shit
Your attemps to rap are innaffectual
Like gettin' butt styles
Like the heart of homosexual
Not for sex
When you rap the intersection
Of damage
Sandwiched knuckles
And what your luck pulls
Bad ones
Catch one or two
Rather a view
A slew for soft ass phonies
Bust your cronies
Try me
You'll catch my Vans in your hinee
That's if my backgrip slips
Though I doubt it
Pout if you want to
Convert me to filey
But I seize more than them candies
Nothing gets by me
So play the tracks
And you'll go out like "later max"
Next to Tajai cause I kicks the greater stacks

Opio

Ske-beep-boom
Bob your head to this
Mischievous
Soul socidle
Idle chatter never slips
Off the lips
Of this writer
Might not be a greater innovater of the rhyme scheme
My style is the visine
To get your eyes opening
This raggedy andy gets dandy like a lion in the meadow
While the teapots blow off steam like a kettle
You hip to the hop
I kick
I trip the life fantastic
Gettin' into the grooves that'll bend the phonographics
The vandal with the vocals
Making the locals go insane
The regal rhymer speeks substinance for the brain
Get frisky with the phrases as you praise this life divinity
The one of liberated soul
Controls for infinity
Got styles by the square mile
Cat's got a frightened child
Hieroglyphics will uplift the rhythms for the meanwhile
Articulate my lingo as I mingle in my medium of speech
And peace to pop prophets as I piner and teach
A smidgen of religion to the fraudulent
Listen
Pay attention
I'm the master of this convention
Kick the wickity wiley stylee
While you sutterin' just like smilee
Skippin shingles of your shattered dreams
Too bad it seems you try me
The wise and wordy wizard
Pays a visit
To your subconscience
Quest to run the land
Distinguish all the nonsense
Optimistic, stylistic, mystic myth
I'm swift like Mercury
Mercy me
I surely shoot the gift

A-Plus

People call me soup just because I'm livin' fat
People call me nasty: it's because I eat the cat
And I swing a bat to level heads
Leaving devils dead
Never said never
Cause of clever heads
Better dreadlocks
On the top of my crop
Never flaky
If this was a field then Bo Jackson couldn't shake me
Bake me
Betty Crocker's oven isn't hot enough
If you wanna spread the skins
Then I got alot of stuff
Not a bluff
Not a tough guy
Thinkin twice
Why step?
Here's a fly rep
I kept my step ladder
I had a fatter spliff I was hittin' on
Now it's just a smidgen like a pidgeon I be shittin' on
Sittin on a futon...
Slippin' lots of boots on
I'm the type of brotha that ya have to get ya troops on
Oops I'm sorry cause I didn't mean to dis you
I could hook a hoe and make her blow like I was tissue
Mary had a little lamb
Adam got a lot of dough
Need help with your garden?
Scholar got a lotta hoes
Yo-I didn't mean hoes
Yo I meant women
If she got the pool, I got the trunks
Let's go swimming
Dip dip dive
Cause I'm live
Liver then
Five or ten
Of the men
On my jock
You don't stop
Here a pimp
There a pimp
Everywhere a pimp pimp
This A-plus grades the quiz-
So there it is
