(“Here we go”)

[Verse 1: Del]
Think for a second, a chance is available
As I appear on your window pane, I scale the wall
Funk Pippen, I pimp the beat, I’m hard on hoes
Every syllable, I meant it, it’s not arguable
Pardon moi, it’s just of wit and wordplay
Throwing you a pitch of a curveball
Slide right in over first base
Flows don’t fret, you pose no threat
Say cheese, it’s your birthday
Y’all going out in the worst way
We gon’ do you the reverse way
Suit and tie affair with business proposal
We now pronounce you D.O.A. or should we go slow?
Don’t try to curve me now, I reached first base
Kiss of death but no kissing on the first date?
Annihilation, paid vacation, yeah, you gotta go
They asked the boss if they still got a job—not no more
The doctor’s out, he’s not at home
Once you hear the beep, you can leave your message
We’ll get back to you as soon the rest of the ransom money’s accepted

[Chorus: Del]
Get some of this, get, get some of (WOO)
Get some of this, get, get some of this
Funk Pippen, Amp Live, get some of this
Get some of this, get some of this

[Verse 2: Del]
No refunds, the return policy states this
No insurance, they know the rules, so don’t break ‘em
Mr. Bojangles, we gon’ make you boogie
With a high price to pay, don’t lose your footing
Oh goody, bullshitting, we ain’t having, dawg
Soon we recognize they waving the white flag like a matador
Once we rectify our wave, they face red but we ain’t mad at y’all
What matters most once you confronted by mastodon?
Pass it on, I want everyone to get it clear
Amp Live, soon we gonna dead the weak that niggas hear
Funk Pippen, Sir DZL, you could call me Sir
If you don’t know me, in other words, you must defer
How many times do we have to tell ‘em this?
When they divide, their attention, multiply it by six
What we get for our time don’t equate to the risk
For just a fraction of the problem, they get some of this

[Chorus: Del]
Get some of this, get, get some of (WOO)
Get some of this, get, get some of this
Funk Pippen, Amp Live, get some of this
Get some of dis, get some of this

[Verse 3: Del]
These big dummies ain’t left—they still here?
Since they don’t need no aid, I’ll make it real clear
Rhinos run through the jungle like lethal shots
Full blast, put big bois in their Speakerboxxx
Overnight success is not the same as delivery
If they got it overnight, it would bewilder me
For plagiarism, fix they grill, think dentistry
If they got an overbite, it’s gonna kill their teeth
Better kill the beef, that’s the slaughterhouse
All that mouth runnin’, pump ya brakes, stall it out
I ain’t meeting no demands, we ain’t negotiatin’
They finna see the power switch when they throw my patience
They know they ancient, played out and below my standards
In denial, illusions of grandeur; I’m too tired to pursue their banter
They get broke down, reduced to granules, make sure the transmission’s cool
If you think I’m dissing you by this description, then this is…
