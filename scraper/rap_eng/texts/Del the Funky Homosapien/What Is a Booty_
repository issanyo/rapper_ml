What is a booty and how will I know if I’m shaking it?
What is the funk and how will I know if I’m faking it?
Cause it don’t tick it don’t mean it don’t tock
The hands don’t stop when the cuckoo leave the clock
There’s nothing harder to stop than that who’s time has come to pass
Del the Funky Homosapien says
On behalf of my behind I feel it is my duty to my booty
That I come in ahead of the class when it comes to butts

Old mother hubbard went to the cupboard to give the poor dog a bone
But when she bent over, Rover drove her, the dog had a bone of his own
He did the loose booty

Del the Funky Homosapien, yeah he’s nasty, he's nasty

[Verse: Del]
I've returned from the meadow with a fellow named X
Two turntables and a spark upon his set
Wet behind the ears from the tears of my peers
Rap is outta control that's what we fear
So we collapse any actual threats
With the new batch of catchy little quirks
And it works like a charm as I bomb and alarm any listeners
Coming through crisper on your transistors
So we can eliminate the frauds
Filled with pride as the audience applauds
Might sound odd to the average Joe Shmoe
The new school passed ya ass like Flo Jo, dodo
Me and CM-PX both construct
Like Kid Creole and the Coconuts
As we drop the bomb with a blast
And now all the natives ask...

What is a booty and how do I know if I'm shaking it?
What is the funk and how will I know if I’m faking it?
Booty do your duty
Somebody say a tail is nothing but a long booty

Funk’em just to see the look on they face
Funk’em, just to see the look on they face
Motherfunk’em, just to see the look on they face
Funk’em, just to see the look on they face
Motherfunk’em, just to see the look on they face
Funk’em, just to see the look on they face
Motherfunk’em, just to see the look on they face
Funk’em, just to see the look on they face
Motherfunk’em, just to see the look on they face
Funk’em, just to see the look on they face
Motherfunk’em, just to see the look on they face
Funk’em, just to see the look on they face

Old mother hubbard went to the cupboard to give the poor dog a bone
But when she bent over, Rover drove her, the dog had a bone of his own
He did the loose booty

[Outro:]
There’s nothing harder to stop than that whose time has come to pass

[Ice Cube:] Ayo, Del
[Del:] What?
[Ice:] The fuck is a funky homosapien?
[Del:] It’s a human being fool, a funky human being
[Ice:] Aight
