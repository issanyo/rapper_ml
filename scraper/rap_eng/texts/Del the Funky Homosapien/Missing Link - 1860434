Hey, I gotta start it
MC's be carted off, ya soft
Dinosaur Jr. will flood that's gotta warn ya what in blazes
Hey this is phat, weigh this, I'll portray this photographs
So the last laugh is mine you're behind
For the mind and for the soul, that's how I roll
Now I hold the mic with my life depended on it
I'm doin' ya bond it, my non gets warts it
And I'm apart from whackness, I'm separated
Did you like how I spiked the ball, despite ya all?
You could come bite a small portion
There's more in the vault
Halt, have a malt
I alta your brain patterns, yet it's my fault
I sustain phatter blends of words heard, stampede
Damn he the speech with to teach
Just me, no simile, never flow simply
'Cause it was meant to be, the truth, the truth
And nothing but the truth, I tell it to the youth
Propelling with the proof in the puddin'
Wouldn't you like to know? Oh, no you didn't
My flows never quittin' and that's the truth
The motherfuckin' truth, my man
I'm on the scrimmage, waitin' for your fucking imitations
And I'm not discriminating myself when I'm making my wealth
Pure facts, it's hard for me to endure whack MC's
I lay my tracks with ease, I'm tellin' you that Del is truth
Appelin' through your arteries, you scar your knees
Bowing, praising, now when I phase in like Kitty Pride, city wide
Confer to kick the rumor, him admit he lies
The truth will set you free when I upset MC's, execute MCs
I do my best to mute MCs
All it takes is intelligence
I'm great with embellishments
They need a savior, so Del is sent
Yeah, the truth, the truth, the nothing but the truth
I tell it to the youth, propelling with the proof in the puddin'
Wouldn't you like to know? Oh, no you didn't
My flow is never quittin' and that's the truth
The motherfuckin' truth, my man, the truth, the motherfuckin' truth
I'll punch you in your tooth, ass drop the roof, bitch
You know my attributes, so don't act cute, it's moot
A closed casket, the most massive fluff
Just me, no simile, never flow simply
'Cause it was meant to be, never concluded
Sever your crew with micro laser surgery
I get Adam split up like atoms like the Molecule Man
Now all of you stand like a congregation on the basement
Titric hip-hop, not carin', sharin'
Tearin' Jones here in clones, wearin' bones, skeletons
Your plasma is like gelatin
And tell a friend who's developin'
'Cause Del's intelligent
Yeah, my lyrical technique, will make ya body freak
My lyrical technique, will make ya body tweak
My lyrical technique, will make ya body seek
The meaning, double teaming, on your motherfuckin' brain
Yeah, see that hoe, too, yeah, bitch fuck it, slammin'
