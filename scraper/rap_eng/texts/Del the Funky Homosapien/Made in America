[Verse 1]
Made in America, where ya
Placed on the totem pole
I got soul
Cause I'm a black man
Never sellin' crack and
Track the police
The facts I release
Go straight through your ear to the mind
Listen, just cause this man is white I won't dis him
I'll enlist him
Work with the system
It's a big country
Ain't nobody's flunky

Be cool, don't lose control
Cause a fool will scold someone else before himself
There ain't no need to be hurt
Proceed to be alert
The seed is in the dirt
When you ain't got nowhere else to look you're gonna find 'em there
And the time you shared
Time together
Maybe climb together
But if it don't work out
Still don't doubt or pout
It's out in the open
Hopin' that it ain't scarin' ya
This is made in America

[Hook]
Made in America
Made where? Made in America
Made where? Made in America
Where dat at? Made in America

[Verse 2]
I'mma have it made in America
Paid in America
Bring about a raid in your area
Who's controllin' who?
You controllon' you
Don't let noone tell you what to do
You your own person
I be thirstin' for more information to deal with the nation
Be forewarned
The more informed you are will help you swarm the farther regions
So please begin
Ask your elders
I'm sure they'll tell ya

Where ya came from
If ya brain's numb
From wonderin'
Where did ya come from then
Ask your moms to drop the bomb
Just remember black is black
No matter the shade
Just be glad that she gave birth to you
It might hurt ya to
But you gotta wonderful life
So take it light, yo
Racial tensions
Makes ya fist tense
It's a cinch when
You don't get alarmed
I'm strong and mighty
Just politely preparin' ya
If ya made in America
Cause then they always fearin'
Ya need a strong foundation
When ya placin' stationed in America

[Hook x2]

Yeah, we got the funk
We got the funk
We got the funk
We got the funk
