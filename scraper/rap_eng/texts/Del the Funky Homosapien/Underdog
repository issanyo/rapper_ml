Underdog (x4)

[Verse 2: Homeboy Sandman]

This one nation under god got me playing underdog
Got my people up in arms, but I ain't sweating barely sweating in my underarms
I ain't even trying to even odds
They call us monkeys everybody's talking bout being fly
Guess we a bunch of flying monkeys this ain't even Oz
And why we fighting this ain't even ours
Far as I can see it's all a farce at least that's what it's been so far
They wanna see the legends fall, but we the legend of the fall
Underdogs by nature for seeing straight through the alleged nature of it all
It's gonna take some patients though is all
And a little more time to build my reputation but all in all it's a ball
Especially because all of ya'll is involved
Peace

Underdog (x4)

[Verse 3: The Audible Doctor]

I stay underdog like paws
Get ready for the onslaught of nonsense that's thus far been far beyond sub par raw
Ooh baby how I like it when mics hit my jaw
Chip tooth for the cause you grip noose for the applause
You just trying to hang but get tangled till you lost
The speech from between these teeth clean like floss
Steady in search of the green like you teeing off but
You offset, I wipe the booth with my ball sweat
He a sick puppy somebody call a vet
Man he gotta be bluffing somebody call his threat
I'mma keep on flowing until we all wet
Bet they looking at the stars till the sun rise
Doc'll mollywop the track until the song dies
Belly flop into the verse from off the high dive
Underestimate the underdog until it's our time
