[Verse 1: Tame One]
I'm finding it funny how dudes got their whole bounce from me
But the only ones they getting from rapping is brown money
Many a penny still ain't enough dollars to holler
So try harder, you can't profit off it? Then why bother?
Imma be ballin' probably calling your main squeezy
To come and see me, completely enthralled by Tame weezy
As easy as I could tap her
I wonder how many other rappers done had her
And got a blow job after, not that it matters
Better than B.I., from North New Jersey C-I-T-Y
I just handle my b.i., work and murk
And you see why dudes is acting like Tame two's
And crews is on it, I do a performance
Next day YouTube is showing it
You get a pat on your back with a [?]
While my purple bud got me
Blowing golden rings for turtle doves
I never heard of you scrubs
I drop the top on you convertible thugs
My buzz in the Bricks doubles every time I get into trouble
You hardly [?] coming up shorter than Barney Rubble

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
From my observation I'm agitated
The way that niggas say that they stunting
But the only weight they pushing
Is their waist and their stomach
Souped off juice like Bishop and wishing for riches
It's so suspicious, without ambition it's superstition
Your bitch fishin', tricking on niggas with more riches
The hoe's senseless, and have no interest to D-Z-L
NFL, niggas for life, citizens who spy (got you)
Your bitch licking for ice, pitiful life
But I maneuver and swerve in Oakland, Cali
Between eight [?] and the burbs
Where they knew I was fluent with words
Stupid thorough without effort, sparking trends
Your friends bite it, I get in the cypher
Within minutes they rapping like him (stop it)
You get the thizz face, big mistake
As I demonstrate my flow is to dynamic for you to imitate
You simians just simulate, you [?] hard
But them hollows will penetrate
That's why I'm reclusive, in the Bay producing
You never knew it, Chyeah

[Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien & Tame One]
I bet you think you special but f-you nephew, you not
In these rough streets, I got enough beats to get you shot
It's nothin', It's nothin'

I bet you think you special but f-you nephew, you not
In these rough streets, I got enough beats to get you got
It's nothin', It's nothin'

[Verse 3: Tame One]
I get you sent for nigga, with them hardcore props
[?] to me wrapped up in a cardboard box
Face all duct taped, head wrapped in a plastic sac
To be left on display where other DJs and rappers at
Decided early on before Marshall was blonde
That I would get on and murk any rapper I set it on
Bet it on black, I could chip you up like Bacharach
Bricks to Cackalack, it's like a hatchback verses a Cadillac
Dudes you get booed saying grace over food
You're no threat, throw your set, you Solo, I'm Boba Fett

[Verse 4: Del the Funky Homosapien]
I'm Lando in my own Millennium Falcon
A Lambo, chillin' in places you can't go
Better music, bigger bars like I'm a citizen of Oz
But in reality I'm imprisoning yall
I'm the Wizard giving the Tin Man a heart
A Scarecrow brain, the lions of courage
Now they provided for my private service
Interlopers get murdered or they fry in the furnace
Or I do 'em like Indiana Jones then I'm diving in serpents
[?] inverted like a detective to find your Centaur

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Hey motherfucker you ain't shit
Ancient history, now listen to this
Ridiculous meticulous spit, dig in the grit
For the black and tan, from here to Pakistan
We packing jams, ask your man, he a avid fan
Got my boots on, too strong, too black like nightfall
Niggas bite so much they think I write for 'em
Assassinate the fake, I put a price on 'em
Roll the dice on 'em, generating random numbers
Leave 'em entranced and wonder why there in a sunder
Wanting to be under a wing, but yall buggin'
Sheer effort forced the course we spearheaded


[Verse 6: Tame One]
I'm clear headed, with weird edits
Giving suckas a reason to fear records, in mere seconds
I vibe like [?] sessions, keep checkin'
For this lyrical hip hop street weapon
Exception to the rule from out the Boom Skwad
With more hot niggas then summer school
The Jersey jigsaw, jack and jiz on your jump-off
Just in case little mama move, I fornicate on her face
Nasty nigga, competition, ain't none
Completely sewer, graffiti doer, Tame One
Been around enough raw shit to get frostbit off it
[?], numbing your tongue, even Ray Charles saw it

[Hook]
