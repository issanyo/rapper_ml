[Verse 1]
Okay, first off, don't expect no deep shit
The world got enough tribulations, we tryna beat it
We with the honors, but that's on the daily
Grind right now, flows composed to entertain the mind
Even so I'm still not an imbecile
Anything I say is meant to lift you to the pinnacle
At the same instance smack suckers down
Verbally, honestly I don't know why they fuck around
Delta time, previous business
Suckers being tempted to crawl off into it
They better chill cause I roll with a tight troop
Forget their rap hits, obviously hot poop
Yo, I'm flipping the steering, grand exposure in real time
As I juxtapose hoses, stupid dough, more so, they can't repeat it
In the telephone booth with broke boots, you sleeping

[Interlude]
*Snoring noises*
Wake your ass up, wake your ass up. Wake your punk ass up

[Hook]
Delta time, smell my rhyme
Diesel do it easily, they sell them shine

[Verse 2]
I could do sixteens or I could do monologues
Similar to Rudy Ray Moore spitting rhymes galore
Rappers ain't that sharp, test their IQ
Stats say they quick to catch a case for trying to bite fools
Plagiarism, say it isn't
They created those flows, but something looks forced
[?] while Diesel belittle 'em
Hardcore, I see the gap between the illusion doors
The tune serious, it spark your curiosity
You ain't a boss if you ain't got employees so stop it please
You mocking me, you oath, you ain't never been flame, boy
On my rugged hardcore like my star flow
Too edgy, too heavy, booth Betty
Fuck the jibber, danger action, dude ready
Power yearning, doors down, they forced out
America's slang that's funkified from its source pound

[Outro]
Just get it from the source, stop fucking with these imitators. I mean, really. It's a look. Terrible. Terrible look. Oh my God. Why squander, you roach? I got you
