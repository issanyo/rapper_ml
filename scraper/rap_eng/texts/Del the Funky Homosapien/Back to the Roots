[Verse 1]
Diamonds are forever, but my rhyming is forever
Reaching my efforts as I'm climbing Mount Everest
Got perfect timing like the president, present and past
And it can't be measured in cash
Try testing me and you get pressed like pheasants under glass
You don't even measure in my weight class
Run up in your shit with the president's mask on
Just like dead presidents, that settles it
Where's the medicine? There's no prescription
For this sickness, you feel the affliction
Musical addiction have you coming back
Just like a haunted spirit on the lyrics
Beyond the limits, past the speed of light
Thought processing, don't even need a mic
I just let it go, Summer set in soul
Summer sets fall, I said it ain't no punk

[Hook] x2
You gotta be better, stronger, faster, swifter
If you wanna live to see the scripture
Of your own vision, it's in your grasp
All you gotta do is learn to adapt

[Verse 2]
I was rolling down the strip, with dip in my chassis
Her lips was nasty, she doing what you can't see
In the backseat of the taxi, I paid my fare
Yes she waited there, in the Bay Area where we hating squares
Like boxes of Cheerios, comparing X's and O's
I perfected the soul movement, glow-inducing
Leaving room for improvement
Believe in yours and you can do it, using the best of your abilities
Lacking capabilities, stretched to capacity
That will be the day when illegal fakes see me scrape
Like a car door, all aboard to Mars and orbit
Around the Earth in the vortex
Don't take the subject out the context
Don't teach the public this nonsense, we should be beyond this

[Hook]
