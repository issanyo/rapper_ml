[Hook]
You gotta get a better view outside
'Cause your third eye blind inside
Do the knowledge, fools get demolished
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this

*scratching* "Homosapien"
Won't you tell 'em what's next on the list...

[Verse One]
Del, You don't need much proof
When I'm in the soundproof booth, I get loose
Your Excellency, better than the rest of emcees, I'm destined to be
My capacitors collapse your fader, when I come lackadaisical
That's the way to go
Smash the radio
Pass the gravy too well I behave a fool
High level virtual humanoid, leave your whole crew destroyed
When I switch to manual
Cause I don't stick to manuals
I'm packed with panic filled, manic skills
That weave the tapestry you can't capture me
On video, DVD, or camera
I mangle mice in a maniacal manner
Feed back, fry ya scanners
They wave white banners, like dandruff
Handcuffed to tracks like a prisoner
Non-visionary commentary, then it isn't us

[Hook]
You gotta get a better view outside
'Cause your third eye blind inside
Do the knowledge, fools get demolished
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this

*scratching* "Homosapien"
Won't you tell 'em what's next on the list...

[Verse Two]
Compelling, unpredictable, how I spit my flow
Get the dough
But rich or poor, I enrich my soul
I can't forget my bro's, that's unforgivable
Live or roll, you can play
'Cause when you get stripped to your bare essence
To finally know your fate
Stop wastin' time and try to share lessons
They're guessin', puzzled, muzzled
By society undeniably subtle
Technology to make a space shuttle
Technology to make the earth rubble
Get a whiff, it smell like trouble
But Del likes trouble and I don't need a double
Meet it head on, that's all there, dead on
There's a time for dancing and mind expansion
Tryin' to balance, your mind is challenged
To get past lies and violence
Lies and silence, wiped out
Like a surfboard, I don't know what hurts more
Knowin', not knowin', I can't control it
But I control my destiny
In my heart I hold it
I can't let the world get the best of me

[Hook]
You gotta get a better view outside
'Cause your third eye blind inside
Do the knowledge, fools get demolished
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this

*scratching* "Homosapien"
Won't you tell 'em what's next on the list...

[Verse Three]
Devastating mic control, levitating mics and flows
Infrared lyrics snipe ya dome
And I write it like a poem
Notorious like Capone
A title I have the right to own
Celebrate elevation
And try to make sense outta these statements
I'm information inflated
While the emcees debate to rate this
Critics don't buy the records
Fans do and I respect that
Del, my signature style is assembled and wild
He can do what he like it's two of me
Both sides of the brain
Watch emcees flow right down the drain
My special moves will rescue you from mediocrity and popular offerings
Operating at a high speed
You don't know yet just try me

[Hook]
You gotta get a better view outside
'Cause your third eye blind inside
Do the knowledge, fools get demolished
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this
Birds eye view catch all this
Stay tuned for what's next on the list
