[Verse 1: Del]
Dropping from the rooftop, searching for foes
Looking through the neighborhood using my nose
Picking up the scents like a bloodhound
Follow the footprints, ears to the ground
By now they know I’m coming so they steadily ducking me
Little do they know, they about to have company
Chase ‘em all the way to the Honeycomb Hideout
They guessin’, they wonderin’, but now they gon’ find out
Knock, knock—who’s at my door now?
I said, “Nobody”, then I kicked the door down
They start scatter, surprise on their face
They try to escape out to the fire escape
They tried to climb down to the fourth floor
My posse shoot ‘em down, now they skydiving

[Chorus: Simmi]
They trip, oh well, well, you can run free (running free)
They trip, oh well, well, you can run free (running free)
Without a care in the world, just runnin’ free
Runnin’ free

[Verse 2: Del]
They was talkin’, soon as I caught wind
I was off in a few seconds, time to clock in
I could see ‘em walkin’
With binoculars, from the window stalkin’
I spied ‘em stepping lively
When they get the itch, they gon’ spread out like poison ivy
They in a restaurant, pouring wine, dining
They don’t know they next meal served in an IV
It ain’t time to crash the party yet
I’ma wait to see how much evidence that I could get
I track ‘em down to the wharf with a large boat
Right now, I could box ‘em in with the cargo
I could see they not keen
I’ma let ‘em think they scot free, see where the plot leads
Not me, never would
In their mind, there’s no possibility of getting caught with the goods
They hopped in the Volvo, burning rubber
I catch a cab and tell him “Follow them, brother”
I think they see us, they trying to lose us
They bust a few corners just to confuse us
Planted some tracers to change the rules up
I followed their activities on my computer
So much better than GPS
I meet ‘em at their address then blow ‘em into fragments

[Chorus: Simmi]
They trip, oh well, well, you can run free (running free)
They trip, oh well, well, you can run free (running free)
Without a care in the world, just runnin’ free
Runnin’ free
Free…

[Verse 3: Del]
Picture a world where you could run free
Picture a world where you could run free
Without a care in the world except getting caught
Without a care in the world except getting caught
Better keep it on the low
Don’t answer that door, I never seen their face before
Better shut your mouth
Don’t let the word out, they might catch us at the house…
