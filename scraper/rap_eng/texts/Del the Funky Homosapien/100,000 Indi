[Verse 1: Casual]
When shit going bad my daughter's looking at me like
"Where you going dad?"
Do some old-school shit
Grab my pool stick and hop in the cab
Money magnets, mover; jagged
They're coming with a hundred styles
Without getting redundant
Abundant blessed success in excess

[Verse 2: Phesto]
Get the drift
I'm nickel slick with articulate
Discourse in any predicament
So hit the dick
Under the relentless
Hammer of logic
Inanimate objects move
Under my telekinetic groove in the vocal booth
So we interrogated rappers 'til they wrote the truth
On record; we introduce a new spectrum
A rhyme texture for dissection
Mic testing
Only slight pressure we might issue
So you know the prototype from these soda pop
Radio ad king cobra types on the mic
Behold when I unfold this soul on ice

[Chorus] X 2
We 'bout a hundred thou' indie
Niggas ain't knowing about
These chips we be spending
We doing it up
And it's only the beginning
That's right

[Verse 3: Abstract Rude]
Don't fret the bud
Spark pops to the wee hours
When doves cry to the cops
These cowards have no shame
You got the game all wrong
And if you get in trouble
Who the one you call on?
Your folks
When so broke with no hope
It's those close
Know what I wrote's dope fo sho
Quotes and antidote franchise
On the damn team
Started to get the ring
On the first ring no mercy

[Verse 4: Opio]
It's only the beginning
Niggas ain't knowing about
The chips we be spending

Your style is bulimic nigga
Anorexic I bust like a tec
Spit wreck-less
Leave you headless
This hard like erect dick
You soft and squeamish
Feminine
Like a seamstress
Serena or Venus
I got the U.S. open
Like I'm Agassi
Fuck Brooke Shields
I'm in the black tail magazine (that's right)
Pass the weed and the cherry flavor paper
So I can attack then
Be prepared to meet my maker

[Chorus] X 2
We 'bout a hundred thou' indie
Niggas ain't knowing about
These chips we be spending
We doing it up
And it's only the beginning
That's right

[Verse 5: Del]
Yeah, my start is your end
Like yin yang, Diablo
D I believe
I entertain with infinite game
Intentions bent to frame
Cultured ultra luminous
He was just tuna fish
Blacking out like a lunar eclipse
When I'm chewing my bitch out
For ruining shit (damn it)
You should just get
The fuck out of dodge
Or learn how to guard
Now that the people know
How you cowards are (we see you)
The power's far beyond yours
I'm your fissure that's provocative with proper shit
Shorty get shut down
Charlatans all get hung, see the strange fruit?
It ain't cute, how they framed you
Knowing it ain't true
But Del proclaims proof
Youthful outlook
Don't let my mouth put me in positions not
Possible to climb out of
But on the flip tip
Plugs in all holes trying to sink my ship

[Chorus] X 2
We 'bout a hundred thou' indie
Niggas ain't knowing about
These chips we be spending
We doing it up
And it's only the beginning
That's right
