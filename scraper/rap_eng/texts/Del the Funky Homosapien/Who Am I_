[Intro: Del]
KP, yo
You know
Who am I?

[Del]
Who am I?
That's for me to know and you to find out
Who am I?
That's for me to know and you to find out
Yo, touch the cusp of the funk, your fingertips do the walking
You seen in all my offerings, it's lingering when I'm talking
KP, no nonsense, I clean my house
Every room free of doubt
Outsiders keep out
Speak about yourself when you diss the nature
Of the game situation, something strange, it is in danger
I'm in my chamber that's fully designed for me
By me, why feed into the high society
Lifestyle, liken a lot to logic in limbo
I'm attuned to attitudes
Attack, they make amends for it
Processor, don't test it, no effort, I go get it
Roll wretched, dome checkers, sole reflection, on the record
Soul got no direction, it be a free for all
Seasons gone by, they still trying to please them all?
Huh, freezer thaw out just like neanderthals
No higher calling, they may as well dissolve
Breathing [???] my standard
Leap into action like creeping panthers, we the champions
