[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
I know they fascinated by the fiction
The way words weave around and warp the will of wisdom
Water down the walkway, wash away the hopscotch chalk marks
Jumping through the portal with a fly and never got far, not smart
Cross they heart and hope to die, a dark park
With suspicious characters: witches and werewolves
Cover up, wear two layers when they stare at you
Can't be too careful 'cause it's there within the air you use
There were two options and they chose to cross
Train of thought, head-on collision, now they ghost float off
It's the mystical list of fools who hover over
Waiting for a chance to host a body like a public promo
Look around, try to find, but it's way behind your sight
Time grind down 'cause it's finite, sliding on ice
And you figured age was infinity but the fine prints you didn't read

[Chorus]
Sad, so sad
Sad, so sad
It's gonna be
It's gonna be
It's gonna be late
Sad, so sad
Sad, so sad
It's gonna be
It's gonna be
It's gonna be late
It's gonna be too late
It's gonna be too late
Late

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
The wizard wanders through the castle, 'bout to slap you
From stopping Mickey from his chores, crack your Adam's apple
You kick the bucket then the bucket kicks you back for it
The broom and the pail whale on Mickey, time to crack the whip
See what happens when you leave Mickey unattended
Practice magic he don't understand, plus it ain't his business
A cacophony of calamities, that's unintended
Waving wands, he don't wanna punch anyone or kick it
Shoot and brick it, 'cause you be the future victim
Crystal ball isn't workin' out it need a Nutrisystem
I'm used to villains lettin' loose and boosting physics
Twisting images, shopliftin' when the noose is fitted
Truth suspended, wool over the eyes but your view is frigid
Frostbitten by the evidence of cooler systems
Used to symptoms like a kind of witchdoctor
Shrunk their heads to a footnote, you can blame the author

[Chorus]
It's gonna be sad, so sad
Sad, so sad
It's gonna be
It's gonna be
It's gonna be late
Sad, so sad
Sad, so sad
It's gonna be
It's gonna be
It's gonna be late
It's gonna be too late
It's gonna be too late
Sad, so sad
Sad, so sad
It's gonna be
It's gonna be
It's gonna be late
Sad, so sad
Sad, so sad
It's gonna be
It's gonna be
It's gonna be late
It's gonna be too late
It's gonna be too late
Late
