[Verse 1: Del The Funky Homosapien]
Yo, jumped out the starship  hitting Illuminati
Hi-fivin' Zentradi, karate chopping martians
Sparks in the brain chamber, way braver
Came with more anger and danger than gangbangers
Megabeast in the space house
Some will never see the energy resonating, they steady hating
Lost on a foreign installation, spinning wayward on an asteroid
Aim at it, laugh and destroy, master noise
Feel the flame, kill the game, resilient frame of mind
Never contain the nano-tech disease, get sneezed out
Degrees outlined and defined what it be about, I see it now
Electro-convulsive therapy got 'em aware of the clarity
Being compromised in the air they breathe
Fear is weak, better to bully they way around
With chemtrails, phase one, ready to chow down

[Hook: Del The Funky Homosapien]
Stranger in their own skin, danger from they own kin, something controlling them
Covert undercover, emotional rollercoaster, make 'em hurt one another
Stranger than fiction, anger predicts the probability of friction
Where does it lead to, the information vehicle, what does it feed to you?

[Verse 2: Natti]
Yeah, well, we riding on beams of light, quite blinding
Shining like diamonds worn by Orion
Holodeck dining, glitches that sneak swine in
Blazing at a speed that threatens to fold time in
Crop signing, fresh to death, start signing
Grab cigarillos, we leaving in t-minus
Gold diggers, grab picks, start mining
Expertise needed, proceed to start climbing
Or give 'em two shoulders, born from cold climates
Hitting hyper drive in the whip that you're hype to drive
Space invaders clicked up with one side
With 2-bit movements we leave 'em stranded on stupid
Smoking Earth and regrouping, reach the moon then we moon them
This journey is strange as the range that I reach when I'm shroominâ€™
