Drop some new shit on 'em them
Let's drop some new shit on 'em

[Opio]

Drop it on 'em Cas

[Casual]

Some brand new new shit
Going

[Del]

Yeah, this D-E-L in the house
And Hieroglyphics crew
Down wit' Matt Kelley, A-Plus, Domino
Man, we about to kick this little shit right here on my down time on the album
Check it out

MC's is too promiscious so if you fuss
I'mma be the next to bust and take you on the Exodus
Wreckless, check us, ain't nobody next to us
Step to us and get reduced to a speck of dust
Fuck the Heaven-less detectives with they secret societies
We speak wit' variety
So stand back
Before you caught in my sand traps
And lariat, you better bury it
Go along with your merriment
Hiero getting every cent
And we earned it and burned it
In your brains like brands
And now, everyone demands
Del and his entourage and you can all get squashed
We mosh it up, we mega and vicious, magnificent
Fuck the whimsical minstrel
We sent to kill competitors and regulate
And make you hesitate, you better wait
Time to set it straight
You never take a foe for granted
'Cause what you ain't peeping
Is equal to what we call "sleeping"
Slumbering and fucking cumbersome
Keep the tabs on the tongues
And let the bomb numb your lungs
Yeah
Cranialologist
The mainey novelist
The tactical graphical
With lyrics for capital
After you, high speed chase to erase
All existing life forms and drive 'em to freebase
