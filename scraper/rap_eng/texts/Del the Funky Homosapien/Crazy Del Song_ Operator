(Scratching, random dialogue)

I seek souls like mines
So my mind finds inner peace
And then a beast
Could never devour
My powers arrive
From survivors of this holocaust
Please be hopeful
Never thinkin' all is lost
In my sector
Specter
Slidin'
Collidin' with my lifestyle
So I fight while they threaten me
Sweatin' me -
Well I'm quite mild
The world makes me gnarly
But an introvert not hardly
I deal with it
I feel a bit
Under the weather
I need to pull my pieces back together
Fallin' apart, stallin' a heart of sincerity
Since there will be another stoplight
And its not right
So I might go insane of this brain
Of mine
Maintain a line that has been tame
Before the tempest
I'm looking to my better interests
I never tried to post or tried to impress
Anyone
So why do I got to suffer
Every single day it seems the way of the world is rougher
And then you wonder why I love to hallucinate
Because I never ever thought I would get used to hate
So I imbedded my time within my mind
And rhymin'
Was the only way I kept from bein' confined
To quarters
Sure there's good times and bad
But the bad time's are overwhelming
And how the hell things
Get out of hand I ask you
You have to give an answer;
Eating at my brain like it was cancer
Worryin'
Hurryin'
My thought processes
I got offices
Imbedded in my skull
A million secretaries actin' scary
When they type 200 words per minute
It just occurred to me I'm in it
Cause I'm the boss
The head honcho
At least to this mutiny
The whole idea is cute to me
So I entertain it
And let my brain get
Deeper and deeper
Until it vibrates like a beeper
And I can't maintain it
So what's the verdict?
It's D.E.L. the visionary and I come with the absurd shit

[Break with freaky "call the operator" sample]

If I had not one friend I would be gooooone
Way in outer space singin' one sooooong:
'Zippety doo dah, zippety day
My oh my what a wonderful day
When my mind's dusted'
Thrusted
Out beyond the stars, I'm the satellite
Transmittin, fit in situations that'll rattle tikes -
Scare 'em
Dare 'em to go farther
So then I go father
Burnin' my brain out with mental lava
Scalding
All things
Rearrange so I never socialize
When you feel my eyes
The dilated pupils
I violated scruples
Cause I told myself I'd never do it again
But now I grin
Laugh on the inside
Men tried to strap me
In a straight jacket
When I laugh and I'm happy
For two hours straight
These powers hate me
And they make me wanna cower
But lately I've been feeling like a tower
Tall and sturdy
Wordy, though I never say a word
Cause when I say a word
Before it's like they never heard
Nothing ever changes except within my cerebellum
So I'll never tell 'em
Never tell 'em
Never tell 'em
I'll tell it to my soul over and over
Even though I'm locked within a room with padded walls
I'm never sober
Inspections
Injections
Keep me confined
To my inner thoughts
And this is how I lost my mind

[Break with maniacal laughter]
