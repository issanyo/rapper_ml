[Verse 1: Del]
So far so good
Jumped out the wood panel like an X-Man
See if anyone could handle the best tan
Thieves I'm attempt degree silver belt
With iller modulating robotics watch 'em marching
With arms ready, A.I. smart and ready
Navigating through the darkness embedding
Heavy artillery is left for me, air assault
Flows hit the snare across the ass
And pause the ads as far as fads
That's them other fools
That utter rules and regulations but never face 'em
They damn self and felt as though they flow may dominate
The fold when I rhyme a phrase feeling some kind of way
Sitting scratching they head trying to figure out what I was saying
It's like they brain dead
Free your mind and the ass must follow
I'ma leap in time they caught in a pothole

[Hook: Del]
Lost in the land of immediate rap hits
Here today and gone tomorrow
Cash, clothes, cars and money (x7)

[Verse 2]
I need to find a way out of this crazy land
Feels like a Lost in Space episode
With Diesel forced to play an extra role
Special guest star maybe, it could boost up ratings
We pop out of suspended animation
Mr. Smith colored us we ain't gonna make it
Busters just play they lame game of Simon Says
Cash out quick at the end
But I think quicker than him
I leave his ass trapped on a doom ship
With no BMI or Ascap
Furious creatures stare like they barely was teething
They never heard nobody flow like how I was speaking
Yeah from a foreign universe
Guess I always was true the first self
Fuck everyone else
Up on the bandwagon like a rescue ship
The guidance system failed doing that test tube shit
Soon as I rap explosives go off
