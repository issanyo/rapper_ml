[Verse 1: Del the Ghost Rapper]
I know you like that, you want to try that
It's like a flashback, so shake your ass crack
I got the balls to rock the salsa
Funk the blues-a, any groove to
Make your move, â€˜cause taking you to
Another landscape is my mandate
I'm highly animated even though I'm decomposin'
So if your feet is frozen, I'ma die to see you ropin'

[Pre-hook: Del]
And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now while the MC rhyming and the DJ cutting
I want y'all to just get down
And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now while the MC rhyming and the DJ cutting
I want y'all to just get down

[Hook: Del & (Scratches)]
Tap your toes and clap your hands
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, trace the globe and shake your pants
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, shake and bake, do whatever it takes
(How many people ready to rock the house?)

[Verse 2: Del]
Gravitational pull'll have you making a fool
Out of yourself on the dance floor
Doing back spins, running man and more
Party down with vigor and candor
Coming to the jam or look like a landlubber
And do the aqua boogie, win lots of goodies maybe
Pop a Gucci wallet, turntables is talking to me
It's awfully groovy, seeing all the treasure and the booty

[Pre-hook: Del]
And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now while the MC rhyming and the DJ cutting
I want y'all to just get down
And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now while the MC rhyming and the DJ cutting
I want y'all to just get down

[Hook: Del & (Scratches)]
Tap your toes and clap your hands
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, trace the globe and shake your pants
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, shake and bake, do whatever it takes
(How many people ready to rock the house?)

[Verse 3: Del]
I want to get down lower than Atlantis
Going toe to toe with an enchantress
Get funkier than Funkadelic wearing Pampers
While you eggheads is on the wall preparing answers
Sharing transcripts, while we over here
Dipping and dancing, rhythm romancing
Wallflowers, giving no action, no
All hours we chillin' and maxin'
So relaxin', opposites attractin'
I'ma toss my hat in, floss when the track spin
Like I'm on a crack bend, jigglin' and wigglin'
Freaking booties, speaking to the cuties so belligerent
No religion, just bump the feed on
You'll feel reborn, negativity we just dead it like decoy
Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on
The pulse when it responds

[Hook: Del & (Scratches)]
Tap your toes and clap your hands
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, trace the globe and shake your pants
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, shake and bake, do whatever it takes
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
