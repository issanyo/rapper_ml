[Verse 1: Tame One]
I've had more than half the game asking
What happened to Tame [?] yelling
I blew the spot like Mount St. Helen
The spray paint fella
Selling more units than Moon Zappa
Came a long way from bathroom rapper
Went from high school high to [?] as a freshman
Didn't [?] yet, got kicked outta Arts
And went to Vailsburg with Wyclef
He was doing music theory
I rocked the basement in the lunch rooms
Slaved the tenth grade on mushrooms
I wrote raps in grandma's front room
I wanted the wealth, she thought I was nuts
Mumbling to myself
Making up bombs, my moms used to work [?]
Introduced us, gave me the name, started a crew
And then he produced us [?] with DJ [?] and Tamer
We changed the name just to change the flavor
To act out in strange behavior
The backstory of my rap story is this
It's mandatory, I'm tellin' it
Put a beat under it, and then I'm sellin' it (that's right)

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Uh, Yeah, Your knight in funky armor
Sir DZL early I predate the genre
Honors and accolades, that's the way the shit went
Growing up in Oakland spitting for the whole district
Gifted student but didn't do shit but ill out
Stealin' comics and for real to be honest
Anything else I wanted
Atari 2600 cartridges I hunted down
Nintendo games when that came in
But before that I ignored class
Snored in the back in the dumbhead section
Writing more raps, jaws get tapped
Lunch money gets snatched
My 6th grade teacher believed I wasn't stupid
Got through my thick skull with computers
But dig it, I was tutored at the college of arts and crafts
As a young lad, I was sketchin' in pads
Perfectin' the craft, I thought that was the way to go
That was in the early 80's though
Hip hop was young, so was I
But already I could feel time slippin' by
I was into poetry, cuz I was on a solo [?]
My comprehension skills was noticeably
Turning over the game, so the school administration
Threw me in [?] classes, I used to hate that shit
I was a latchkey kid, I walked home from school
Moms and Pops had to go and get food
Scraped them for what they was makin'
Not the happiest home but still I had my rapping and poems
I didn't even get high 'til the 90's
Didn't feel the need to, my life was simple, just a preview
Before I even touched the EQ
Before motherfuckers started calling me DZL (Chyeaah)

[Verse 3: Tame One]
I went from hard to deal with
To hard to get, to hard to get defined
Now to labels I'm too hard to listen to
Making me too hard to sign
I find most of you folks on
Too much coke to be dope, but I smell you though
That's why I sniff so much before these shows (Shhh)
Enemies know, I reinforce the stereotype
Here we go like I live off of [?]

[Verse 4: Del the Funky Homosapien]
The fear in your mind, you need to go bury your mic
Nefarious hype ain't gon' get you nowhere but sniped
Broad daylight rhymes launch in aerial flight
Bullseye, uh, pull the [?] from over your eyes
This is [?] for the foes demise
Nobody told you why cuz it's a cold world
Antarctica in the heart of the [?]
Cuz I gotta get paid no matter what happens
Even though those who words stand firm like solid ground
Is who I like hangin' around, banging the sound
Changing the language of the arrangement and sound
Breaking it down, I see [?] in the crowd, holdin' it down
Hiero and whoever clique known to get down
We can get down, notice the style
Tame One is the one who wrote it but now
I can take it and [?] it up a little bit you know with
Drop like that
