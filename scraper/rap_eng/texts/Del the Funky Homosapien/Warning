[Hook]
I tried to give him a warning
I think he too caught up
On shit that don't matter

[Verse 1]
Yo I used to run around with Kevin
I said used to cause Kevin would leave me headsick
Dude just had a loser mentality
So he would always do stuff to try to challenge me
Back in eight grade I brushed it off
But he still doing this shit, what the fuck is wrong?
I can't trust him at all, he hit below the belt
Plus he overindulgent cause he don't know himself
He told me go to hell and got overzealous
Once I started making records, I could tell that he was jealous

[Hook]
I tried to give him a warning
I think he too caught up
On shit that don't matter

[Verse 2]
He used to put himself on front street
Out in public playing around like he punking me
Knowing damn well that ain't how you talk to fools
That's when I caught the clues, he must be all confused
He the type that be, uhh... lying to kick it
With no place to go, he always tryna to visit
He got the mind of a midget, tryna act profound
I had to pull him to the side, tell him "slow down"
In case you didn't know pal, that ain't attractive
Realize before someone actually slap ya

[Hook]
I tried to give him a warning
I think he too caught up
On shit that don't matter

[Verse 3]
Homeboy act like he always had a plan
Soon as we hit the club, there go the avalanche
He ask a chick, uh, if he could have a dance
If she says no, he says "fuck it" and grabs her hands
He the type to, uhh... buy Gucci sneakers
Living with mom, but not cause he choose to be there
He be scared, don't even leave the house
But when he's with me, he got the nerve to speak with his mouth
About KP and say what he need to do
I say "you need to be cool, 'fore someone ether you"

[Hook]
I tried to give him a warning
I think he too caught up
On shit that don't matter

[Verse 4]
Yeah well, this is the end of the saga
Cause when your pretend partner wanna holla, don't bother
He just wanna be down with the beat movement
That mean he so pro? But no, cause he's stupid
I've had close calls with us both against the wall
With the police just checking our balls
I'm not the one to say that he's a lost cause
But he be acting like a rockstar and he ain't a star
I tried to give him a look and tell him obey
Before you catch a fade, but he didn't listen, no way
Guess where he going today? He 'bout to go away
To the big house, dig what I was spitting about?

[Outro]
Yeah, bye fool, you buster
I'm out
