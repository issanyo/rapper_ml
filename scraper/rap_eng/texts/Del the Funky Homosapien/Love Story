[Intro]
Yo yo yo, check this out man
1 for you, 2 for me
3 for you, 15 for me
20 for you... now check it out

[Verse 1]
Yo
I just won 10 grand in the Galactic
Rhyme Federation championship, so I'm laughin' a bit
I feel like returnin' to Earth and burnin' some herb
I'm sick of lookin' at the inside of space stations
Time for Deltron to take a vacation
My expertise in aviation got us to our destination (where?)
The East Bay
My living quarters is completely froze solid
I thaw it out with a heat ray
Now I'm chillin' in a sauna, pulsating jet streams
Peeping out in virtual reality my wet dreams
Perusing my 21st century classic comics, the fun is astronomic
(ha ha ha) I figured since I'm here I'll renew my galactic passport
So I'm not persecuted by no galactic assholes
Schemers on the ave (yeah)
With their holographic hat-tricks
Using magnetism to pick-pocket citizens
Tourists walk around with memory apprehension glasses
They attempt to capture
The past tense
Virtual junkies, burnt out and lost
War veterans still trapped in the Holocaust

Yes I know all the answers
Living in my true love's arms

[Verse 2]
I'm sittin' on the porch readin' Cosmopolitan
Peepin' all these dumb hoes with enhanced collagen
I'm calling in sick today - big mistake
This resulted in a final pay check and pink slip to take
Replaced by my successor cause I missed my place
Knowin' that the Rhyme Federation will miss my face
(fuck y'all)
Referred to as a big disgrace
Now I'm free-lance with more risks to take
Now a rhymin' merc, finding certified androids
Hit a convention, signin' autographs for fan-boys
They admire my enhanced stanzas
And how I dodge man-hunts and security cameras
Avoided apprehension in subatomic dimensions
And even more impressive 'cause of what we live in
A self contained environment, I suggest I'm just a minor threat
I see a thing of beauty fly as heck, standing by her desk
Paid her my respects, I was too scared to try to step
So I deployed one of my androids with dialect
Synthesized with my voice perfectly replicated
Asked for her name, and was she married?
"No, we're separated"

*Booty*
Baby... baby you're looking real fine...
Your behind, you got 3 booty cheeks...
That's kind of unique for... for on this planet
What say me and you hit the hot spot over at your house?
I got a few sandwiches that need to be eaten
Yo it's cool though, you got one eye ? trippin' though
Listen you, me and you, we goin' places; we gon' far, go all the way to Mars
Venus... we'll go to Venus if you want to
Venus, Paris?

Yes, I know all the answers
Living in my true love's arms (2x)
