[Verse 1]
Funk Pippen, that’s my game
And more Funk Pippen, whatever I say go
They know—if not, they gon’ find out
Pipe down, on my treat, they get the buyout
It’s my house, it ain’t built with sticks and rocks
The big bad wolf tickets won’t blow the bricks apart
Interception, I’m gone, ‘bout 50 yards
No field goal, go home and kick some rocks
They get distraught trying to switch the mark
I know where I put the shit down, my shit’s the bomb
Let’s go, death hole, stretch your, limbs out
Like Plastic Man, and launch they ass like elastic bands
That’s a slingshot; everything I bring hot
One touch will melt their ass just like a Ring Pop
Only the chosen few get into the mode I use
They be overused, therefore, they’re just disposable
Ice cup with the roof on top of your house
That’s a trash can, last stand, they knock a man out
Surrogate parent, it’s apparent I’m sonnin’ ‘em now
Check the calendar, Father’s Day, you honor me now

[Chorus: Del]
Don’t get lost in the glow, the glamour, the glitz
You just work here, you don’t know who the manager is
Don’t get lost in the glow, the glamour, the glitz
Better steer clear, all you gon’ do is crash in the whip
Don’t get lost in the glow, the glamour, the glitz
You’ll get nowhere if you don’t quit that crap that you kick
If God appear and bestow some miraculous twist
Then you could cheer and you hold up your rappin’ to this

[Verse 2: Del]
Nowhere man, all you was was a troll of The Beatles
Think you hold the world on your shoulders, you know that you’re feeble
Very funny, dummy, think you cold but no one believe you
Come visit to the North Pole, you know it’ll freeze you (AH-CHOO)
That’s sub-zero; tried too hard to be a weirdo, that ain’t really you
No sense of style, I sense your style is false
Something fishy, I could pick up the scent for miles
Infantile, what I expect from a simple child
And you can see how we different now
This is how it’s done, I don’t give a fuck what they mouth run
It’s not about how they front, it’s about the outcome
How dumb can they all remain?
Left back, they can’t walk the stage
What they call a game, I play hard and score the most
They give theirself extra points for lower goals
I don’t know, what’s the point, they showboat
Perpetratin’ like they rich—you know you broke
And you know it’s true, I can see the hoe in you
Pimped by the bandwagon, do what they told you to

[Chorus: Del]
Don’t get lost in the glow, the glamour, the glitz
You just work here, you don’t know who the manager is
Don’t get lost in the glow, the glamour, the glitz
Better steer clear, all you gon’ do is crash in the whip

[Verse 3: Del]
Sit back, grandstanding, you don’t know you old news
And you thinking you so cool—no, fool
I’m going hard, no regard
‘Cause fools be thinking they bigger they are—Napoleon Bonaparte
They going far out their comfort zone
They get blown apart, hemoglobin and bone shards
Stormy weather, better go get an umbrella
Or get hit by some fella’s guts sailing
Beat chunks cover the street up
Gotta wait for trash day for the clean-up
That’s what happens when Funk Pipp come home
And why they call him Funk Pippen? I manipulate the tones
I make the flows the walk the track; yeah, I’m all of that
Invest a dollar in yourself and get five dollars back
Holla back…DZL

[Chorus: Del]
Don’t get lost in the glow, the glamour, the glitz
You just work here, you don’t know who the manager is
Don’t get lost in the glow, the glamour, the glitz
Better steer clear, all you gon’ do is crash in the whip
Don’t get lost in the glow, the glamour, the glitz
You’ll get nowhere if you don’t quit that crap that you kick
If God appear and bestow some miraculous twist
Then you could cheer and you hold up your rappin’ to this…

[Outro]
You may think you have profound revelations
Only to discover later that they are none too profound
(Ooh yeah)
