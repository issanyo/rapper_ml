["Sad But True" Verse 1]
Hey, I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there
Hey, I'm your life
I'm the one who cares
They, they betray
I'm your only true friend now
They, they betray
I'm forever there

["Sad But True" Chorus]
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true
I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true

["Clint Eastwood" Hook]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

["Sad But True" Verse 2]
You, you're my mask
You're my cover, my shelter
You, you're my mask
You're the one who's blamed
Do, do my work
Do my dirty work, scapegoat
Do, do my deeds
For you're the one who's shamed

["Sad But True" Chorus]
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true
I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true
