[Pre-Chorus: Aaron Miller]
Catching the come down
Can you come and save me?
I can't seem to hold out
Feel my heart caving
If I turn around
If I lost my way
You know where to find me

[Chorus: Aaron Miller]
I got you in my veins
Tonight
You're killing off my pain
It's alright for now
But it's not enough
Could never get off your love

[Verse 1: Billie Black]
You keep me warm enough
I feel you in my blood
You're in the corners of my mind
And I'll be closing up
Are we closing up?

[Interlude: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Man I mean being with you is like so dope
No, I mean like really dope

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
I got the hookup without one prescription
Can't wait to cop this drug addiction
Show me some love like another victim
Soon as it's ejected it rush the system
We grow closer or grow ulcers
Overdosage, beat it's own coaster
Like machinery I need the voltage
Lots of players on the field, we need coaches
I propose you seem revolted
My attraction, your repulsion
Once I find the needle in the haystack
Then I'm lookin' for where the clear vein at
Strap the arm, thump it too
Inject and pump it through
Put me in a methadone clinic
That's what happens when I got you in my...

[Chorus: Aaron Miller]
I got you in my veins
Tonight
You're killing off my pain
It's alright for now
But it's not enough
Could never get off your love

[Bridge: Aaron Miller]
You know it's not enough, enough
You know it's not enough, enough

[Pre-Chorus: Aaron Miller]
Catching the come down
Can you come and save me?
I can't seem to hold out
Feel my heart caving
If I turn around
If I lost my way
You know where to find me

[Chorus: Aaron Miller]
I got you in my veins
Tonight
You're killing off my pain
It's alright for now
But it's not enough
Could never get off your love

[Outro: Aaron Miller]
It's not enough
It's not enough
It's not, it's not enough
It's not enough
It's not, it's not enough
