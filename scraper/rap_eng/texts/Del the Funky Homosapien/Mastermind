[Intro]
Woah
Hey, let me man- ask my man over here
Hey man, let me ask you a question, see if you know what's up

[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Who fuses the music with no illusions
Producing the blue prints clueless?
Automator - defy the laws of nature
Electronic monolith throw a jam upon the disc
The futuristic looper with the quickness
Hyper-producin' hydrogen fusion liquids keep your distance

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
First we coerce your brain patterns
Collaborate with time-consumin' re-programmin'
I apply the flow cannon, the combo so slamming
Atomically reconstruct the whole canvas
His logic impress, a hypnotic effect
Ya latent patent you could call it a gift
Man he all in the mix nuclear physicist
Genetically tailored every bit of this stimulus

[Verse 3: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Psionically bionically forget how you feel
Especially formulated the rest of you fornicated
It takes more to make this
He juggles variables
Unparalleled propulsion to carry the load
Neural surgeon the purest virgin conducting currents
Musical Merlin he shines like sterling
Watch Automator draw a laser of a higher intensity
And instantly miss a beat create a symphony

[Verse 4: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Hey I know now, I know now repeat
Automator's on the planet Earth
And he's gonna stop the war of the worlds
Deltron Zero is here as well to clique together for real
(that's pretty good man)
He told y'all evil do'ers he is
Truly gifted in the matters of rhythm
(yeah I'll give him that)
Yeah you got to give him dap
With his infinite wisdom you know you got to get with him
