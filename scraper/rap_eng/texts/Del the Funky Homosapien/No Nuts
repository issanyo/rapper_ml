[Del]
Del meister, 'bout to heist ya, hijack ya, coming back
Listen to this, peep it

The transfixer, reprimand your bland fixtures
Replenishing with my menacing sentencing
Up inside this, oblige with guidance
From the funk expanding, verb tridents
I glance upon the multitudes of weak and seek
To organize concentration camps so they can get lobotomized
Fucked so bad, you feel sodomized, time for words to be colonized
To keep regards tall in size, erecting the best things in life
My flows composed for foes ta (breathe)
My enemies cheese in my face and embrace my palm
I'm hella stern but my face is calm
Keeping the hip-hop scene vibrant, I come alive with good tide
It's fine and MC's silent, milestones in Hiero history
Lead you wishin' we was never released, at least
Even if our demo tapes add to the myth of Hiero's gifts
Those that don't agree is just pleading the Fifth
Proceeding to inscript the code that makes your brain overload and implode
Too much imagination got you facing defeat
Quit rhyming 'cause you wasting a beat
It's Del with my diabolical follow-ups
And log the augmented tales to keep your mind tinted
With interest, and that was just an entrance

[Hook: Del]
Save it, put it in your pocket for later
It's all greater, I'mma do you a small favor
Deliver what we call beta, for y'all and your neighbors
With Del on the mic, and Rob on the fader
Wait up, hold up, Hiero got it sewed up
You know what? Del is coming through with the cold cuts
Competition shouldn't have even shown up with No Nuts
We robust, Del is coming through with the cold cuts

[Verse 2: Pep Love]
The cold cuts
Make the whole planet panic and when it blows up
I hit 'em again and again, trust no one
The Hieroglyphic mics have been, desecrated by the likes of them
And I don't know about that diplomatic shit
I rather let it just crank when niggas be on the dick like a nympho
I murder 'em, like hurdling obstacles
It cause holocaust, all I got is word and balls
I'm hot pepper that you don't wanna taste to see
So just watch me lace the beat, gracefully
And ain't a nigga got a thang to say
My broken language slay niggas that came this way, aimlessly
My automatic spray, wreak havoc and may-hem
If you got something to say, come to the Bay
And get it off your chest, then put it to rest
Another competitor bested; better to just shut the hell up
Develop your skill and get enveloped still
With my nigga Del up to bat, turn yellow belly and lilly livered
We delivered the Russian Roulette
You never know, it might get you wet
I'll make a issue out of that bitch who tried to diss (WHO)
Thee invincible Hieroglyphics crew
I'll grab that ass by that braid and shock you like Raiden
Wash your mouth out with dick and keep skating pass
The irrelevant punk that pump, fiction
But no, he don't want no friction
I got a mic addiction, that I don't wanna kick
Mine's are original rhymes, that are three-dimensional
Inching up to the pinnacle and cranking my engine up
And then I'm out with the middle finger up
And a perpetual "S" on my chest
Just to let you know we still the best

[Hook: Pep Love]
Save it, put it in your pocket for later
It's all greater, I'mma do you a small favor
Deliver what we call beta, for y'all and your neighbors
With Pep on the mic and Jay on the fader
Wait up, hold up, Hiero got it sewed up
You know what? Pep is coming through with the cold cuts
Competition shouldn't have even shown up with No Nuts
We robust, Pep is coming through with the cold cuts
