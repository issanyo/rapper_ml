This is real hip hop not no phoney phranchise
Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide
This is D E L not no phoney phranchise
Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide
This is Hieroglyphics not no phoney phranchise
Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide

Rag Del, impetuous, tempestuous
My power's activated, have to make it, funky

Del deep, scuba diver wet suit who survived to get loose
Brewin' in the test tubes to the rescue, extradition process
To get you all stressed, step onto my office
That's what you call fresh, it's more like some soft breasts

If I stopped cess, I probably would cough less
Test it, just to see if ya'll rested
I'm blessin' the beat just like if I was the best man
Yo, you miss it in ya' public school district

Get a book and do the physics, yo' I got a cool image
Like Hendrix, my kindred, y'all fuck up to my index
Bench press rappers doing sets with my Syntax
Ain't nothin' new motherfucker, man I been black

Impact, remember Malcom X wore a pimp hat
You paper chasin' when you make it then you spit that
That your whole life shoulda never even been rap
Wannabe gangster fool around and get your friend capped

Talkin' hella shit my brother trying to buy a ten sack
Man, just call me amphibious
Submerging so deep yanking curtains on these idiots
Walking 'round oblivious more than annoying

Everywhere I turn a black life is destroyed
And times is getting tough gotta sign for unemployment
Walkin' round the town all 'noid and bent
Out of posture from sixteen blunts, a pint of vodka

Intoxicated some of y'all call it faded
With my headphones slammin' playin Iron Maiden
Sleepin' in the lobby of the Days Inn

Never outdated
When my power's activated, have to make it, funky
I'm barn storming, alluring, curing your ailments with lyrical talismans
Here it is, for the scrutiny of every record reviewer
Your tool to reduce your little rhymes are non existent

Meticulous methods I use to modify, the style you all should try
Posh poetics, cost effective, neck and neck with sun beams
Transcends the fabric of time, yah, it's one thing
Named Hiero, habitual funk, fiends and freakerz

Techniques from the major leaguers leaves you meager
Style malfunctional ,I'm punchin' in early
Right on schedule gold medalist rebellious
(Who?)

Del is, got you cornered like a cougar
Comin' up with new words like you must be a lummox
Wanna infiltrate my crew when you know you'll go nuts
Lactose intolerant your bowels'll blow up

Catostrophic so deep can't locate with metal detectors
Listen more then once you'll need several inspections
I'm sicker than a beef recall, reiterate the fact with flows that free fall
Reintroduction the classic material, that last with imperial

Props and Pop Will Eat Itself
Hotter than coals tread and your feet'll melt
Like plastic i castrate contenders
With a crew that got more power than the Westcoast Avengers
Sit and let your ears swim in the splendor

This is real hip hop not no phoney phranchise
Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide
This is D E L not no phoney phranchise
Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide
This is Hieroglyphics not no phoney phranchise
Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide

Mouth watering musical madness
More bomb than Bombay in glad bags
Get mesmerized, spellbound Del found profound
Hip hop essentials mandatory for the mental

I used to be dazed and confused
Now I'm amazed and amused at life and its clever ruse
I have compassion while other brothers askin' for trouble
Brain damage got 'em befuddle

Yo, while I'm on stage pumpin' fear
Your over there in the corner drinking non alcoholic beer
Dominating, commentating moving on to great things
Embracing the lunacy, lacing the community

With one, two, and three for all clueless emcees
They need guidance, tutorials from the Overlord of skill
Magnifying music with my magnificent mind
That blinds with such shine it's embarrassing

Hop in the caravan with Hiero and hit the road to take care of fans
You know what, I'm claimin' dozens, it's Sudden Impact Crib Death
It's big threat major counter-act like tazers
Trailblazers, we clown the name sayers

I crave flavorings with custom tailorings
I can communicate with aliens, it's a daily routine
It's never failing you fiends to get cream
By the continuity the rhymes move in unity
Perfectly with the tunes, I hope it hits you soon

When my power's activated, have to make it funny
