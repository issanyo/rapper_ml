[Verse 1: Del]
I light the firecracker, wire-tapper
Tryna crack the, pieces of information, he should asked us
Game chopper, insane logic, brain brolic
Trained pilot, I aim at plain targets
Keep rollin’, stay glowing
So cold, it would behoove fools to chill or be frozen
No wins for those kids
Gon’ get burnt out burning the fuse at both ends
Trend-starter, get larger
It’s do or die, see what I do to fools who pretend they martyrs
Who are you? Don’t argue
Like you so familiar with the anatomy you claim, no part 2
Forecastin’ more fashion, sportcastin’
Playin’ ‘em for a spell, no more racket
So hot, robots gon’ pop
Deactivate their program, that’s a remote stop
(“Skill is needed—are you interested? Keep the frequency clear”)

[Chorus: Goapele]
What they’ll never see, and who they’ll never be
You are so far beyond
What they’ll never see, and who they’ll never be
You are so far beyond

[Verse 2: Del]
Got shit designed for the ear
Just to make you recline like a chair
Man of the board, over affairs
You see it come and go like it was invited there
Keep it to yourself, though, that ain’t for tell
Or you’re undone and your prophecy fail
Come to the conclusion it probably failed
When foes brew a plot like ale
For the dough, they’ll go against the grain
No matter how you slice it, that’s a crummy way to play
They got it coming to ‘em like age
When they turn up and they on another page
They phased out, last year they got played out
Frequency too weak, transition, they way out
Going nowhere, their transmission gave out
Gassed up but can’t accelerate now
Who cares? It’s time to celebrate now
By breaking down how they fear of a breakdown
Trying to be swift, pump your brakes now
Word travels fast soon as it break out
Foes we take out once we give the order to go
We drive through and then they get what they paid for
Unstable situation—who’s supporting them, though?
I don’t know

[Chorus: Goapele]
What they’ll never see, and who they’ll never be
You are so far beyond
What they’ll never see, and who they’ll never be
You are so far beyond

[Verse 3: Zyme]
Damn, I had them sad eyes when my dad died
Why are the pure guys always the bad guys?
I ain’t from here, I just passed by
Why you always cattin’ on your last life?
Little do they know, I ain’t little no more
I ain’t saying I’m the biggest, I’m just bigger than most
You flashy with your bread, cinnamon toast
All these rappers are actors in cinema shows
Oakland showed me how the third eye open
Slow motion, sipping magic potion
Lonesome, home alone, Macaulay Culkin
Broken, I think apocalypse approaching
In the danger room but my name ain’t Logan
Hot enough to light a fire in the ocean (so hot)
Watch the walls all close in
It’s game over for you now, insert one more token

[Chorus: Goapele]
What they’ll never see, and who they’ll never be
You are so far beyond
What they’ll never see, and who they’ll never be
You are so far beyond
