Hip hop, an asylum
Run by inmates, who be wilin'
So I'm comin' with a heavier dose
This medication is safe for you slowpokes
Don't choke, just swallow it, follow it
With this funk flow poured from the bottle, kid
Some of y'all don't mind if you die in the spotlight
Long as you shine you be crossing the line
And you out of your mind
They very own personal Dr. Frankenstien
And the monster is right in front of your face
You can't figure it out, you figure it's me
Cuz I stay way ahead of you dweebs
My regiment be the strictest rituals
Habitual funk for competition, it's critical
Get exposed in the expose
Soon as you step on stage, get fragged with grenades
Average a day of raps per capita
Slappin ya, you just a passenger that be tagging along
You averagin' on some other shit you think is nice
Well think twice
Life is too short to be a shorty
Is the story of the glorious trail
The metamorphosis of Del
Livin' large, the niggas in charge of the game
Like a caretaker, a shareholder with a rare aura
Everybody think they hip connected
Through the world-wide web with microchips
Cellphones radiate the mic I spit into
Sending feedback so please just leave that
Thing where you came from
I'm-a leave your brain numb
You ain't gonna need it after feeling the invasion
Ceiling's gonna cave in
Vibrations bounce and drill into the pavement
I'm thrilling you with entertainment

Yo, I never gave anybody hell
I just told them what's up
And they thought that was hell
D-E-L and I'm back from hell
Trapped in hell where I learned to master self
Have you in a spell
With the magical raps that I tell
Caught in a rapture relax with yourself
Funk'll fill you with a passion that'll push you past it
And leave them tricky bastards in hell
H-E-double hockey sticks
I know I'm hot so hop off my dick
Talkin' shit at a mile a minute
You can tell a lieutenant to fuck the speed limit
You know when it's on once you smell that fire and brimstone
I'm at the endzone

I find most of this bullshit pushed as entertainment
Very educational as soon as they make a home and try to take control
I just pick up a book and read
Cuz I can't believe
None of the crap they put on TV
Satellite vision
Hell if I listen to a motherfucker who whole mission
Is to get into my brain
Sit and find blame with anything I got goin'
They plot is more important
All I gotta say is 'so what?'
Reality TV is so far from that
Motherfuckers be washed up and try to come back
-----wax indicated madness
Imitation of the fatness that is now public access
At this moment in time
You are frozen in time
I am holding you with rhyme flow
Patterns that average adults say is thought provoking
He talks like he's brought up from Oakland
And hold notions back
Till I find the quotient
I feel like a Vulcan amongst trollkins
No comprehende
If they got the sense from they sensei
They sensei he been gay
And that's what me and my friends say

H-E-double hockey sticks
I know I'm hot so hop off my dick
Talkin' shit at a mile a minute
You can tell a lieutenant to fuck the speed limit
You know when it's on once you smell that fire and brimstone
I'm at the endzone

Ladies and gentlemen
I present to you the finest
Your Highness
Sir Diesel
Your knight in funky armor
I'ma put you in the mood to funk
Funk'll have you feeling the groove
Yeah the groove is on me
On the house
I'm buying at the bar
Try me out
You know them other dudes is butt
Straight ass crack
Now you asking for your money back
This one's on me, on the house
Let me see something
Show me what it's all about

Hey, I never gave anybody hell
I just told them what's up
And they thought that was hell
D-E-L and I'm back from hell
Trapped in hell where I learned to master self

Sweat pouring on my shirt
The air conditioners don't work
