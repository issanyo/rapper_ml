OK There's always some bitch-ass with they fuckin' mouth hangin' open...
Then some other fool with em', they don't fuckin' know no better...
They finna be like "Hold up, he was there right a minute ago"

OK, Just to let you dickwipes know what's shit life for real, sit tight
I pick mics up with levitation, beggars achin' to reach, they'll never make it...
Dzl, rappers make for an incredible banquet
Eatin' 'em all, deeply involved, teachin' us all, the populace problem
Of less creative minds, too many of y'all dumb...

Bars run laps, my cup runneth over
Your bitch wanted more, I fucked her on the sofa
I be on a cold one, wintery disposition
It a'int hip to be in the position
To give new juice, some big dude
OK take up boxing cuz you can't flow anyway...
Niggas be pantyweights up against the heavyweights
Look these niggas dead in they face, tell 'em they betta' pray

Afterburnaz, thrustin', blastin' off!
HaHaHa!! You can eat my dust...
Fuck you, you, you, and you too
Goofy ass niggas, give a fuck what you do...

Afterburnaz, blast off, mics away!
See your ass in hyperspace!
Parsecs ahead, you can't target
Lyrical marksman, nigga kill the argument

Globally known for skill
Y'all roadkill, hold it still
Let me aim, fair game
Y'all cheatin' though
Leavin' your meat exposed
For a deep blow, pieces explode...

Get fragged, get bagged, get captured
Bitch at car, but I captured your flag...
Miraculous raps, too swift for you to adapt
More uproar and racket than a gun clap...
Pin-up the co-ordinates with a thumbtack...
We comin' to tap that ass, stun gun packed....
Arrivin' on the planet surface
With Leonard Nimoy and Captain Kirk with
Sir Dzl, First People, that's the heritage...
My flow you cherish it, foes beware of it...
Not bein' arrogant, my flow been tested
Blasted with a hundred rounds, no impression!

Afterburnaz, thrustin', blastin' off!
HaHaHa!! You can eat my dust...
Fuck you, you, you, and you too
Goofy ass niggas, give a fuck what you do...

Afterburnaz, blast off, mics away!
See your ass in hyperspace!
Parsecs ahead, you can't target
Lyrical marksman, nigga kill the argument

OK, when my minds made
Fade all charades, they too late, tardy
In the dean's office, for obscene flossin'
Been seen flossin' with no scrilla...
Perpetratin squirrel for chinchilla
Fool! I been hotter, squabbin' like Bin Laden!
Send comments to bomb your conglomerate...
Y'all too monotonous, my brain be measurin'
The exact prescription of dope to leave you noddin'...
Hobgoblin, I be mobbin' with rocket launchers...
Lookin' for niggas cuz y'all be talkin' hella shit!
I ride through on two elephants!

Speakers, left and right sides envelopin'!
Your surroundings, I'm down to start clownin'!
Anybody houndin', doggin' my sound and delivery
I'll have you know... you can't get with me

Specifically with words, but you a'int hearin' me...
I'll have you know! You can't get with me!
Specifically with words, but you a'int hearin' me...

Go get a hearin' aide!

Afterburnaz, thrusters blastin' off!
HaHaHa!! You can eat my dust...
Fuck you, you, you, and you too
Goofy ass niggas, give a fuck what you do...

Afterburnaz, blast off, mics away!
See your ass in hyperspace!
Parsecs ahead, you can't target
Lyrical marksman, nigga kill the argument
