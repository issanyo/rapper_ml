[Verse 1]
Del, my main brain function is gang busting
I aim dunking scrumptious gumption despite you assumptions
I like lumping up dumb cuts with abundance
Rhyme reservoirs that glitter like a gun bust (bloaw)
Obnoxious to coppers and fake Hip-Hoppers
They bite my steez and try to doctor my cross-words
For the highest offer I plot the Oxford
Poetical posture that gotcha, like the shocker
Nocturnal burning herbals, playing Turbo Graphics
Federal reserve your cabbage, you don't deserve to have it
Curb your habit, a fictional farce and fairy tales
I know you very well, and rise to the top like Ariel
Periscope's up when I loc' up
Landmine logistics, the digits ain't listed
I flood cupboards with natural disorder
Cause when I hit the doja, I switch over
I sent cobras amongst your rosebuds
No buzz, not even from 500 pounds of Folgers
Go get you a pass, you sniffing the ass
Pay attention in class, cause if you do that
You might...

[Refrain]
Get it in focus, didn't you know this
This mission is hopeless, pitiful poets didn't get no wins
My signature slogans splitting ya open
Hittin' the dosha, told you that you'd better listen closer
...Focus your mind

[Verse 2]
My rhyme quality quantum armed when gone to lunch
And you can come along with us
My syllables savvy; Gravity's entrapped in
Cabins with brain seizures, so pack your aspirin
Burn baby burn your chapped and blackened
Like charcoal but our soul subtracts the saccharin
And cheesy packaging, we be trafficking
The contraband on a plantation after we break in

Nothing can awaken, shaken your mind
With blatant basement bombshells that keep strafing
Have faith in Me and Paul
The weed I freeze the remedial and eat 'em like a Peter Paul
Beat em all fair and square, prepare for static
I'm char-is-matic, from hair to fabric
Avid aviator when I'm facing Vader, with divine sacks
I leave your mind and your spine tapped
Face the music, embrace the true sense
Of pain, when I stomp your brain and leave shoe prints
If you hot, then I'm the coolant
I rule with ironclad mandibles, they trap you in a pencil

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
When I'm upon the track, it's a common fact, I'm bombing that
Smash it like a pomegranate, better call in management
Tandem mist of cannabis, random sniffs get you rambling
The ambulance will handle that, examine facts
Ferociously, you spoke to me like you close to me
Like you folks with me, who you 'sposed to be?
Next thing I know you'll try to dose my weed
Toast to me, cause I broke the speed barrier
Repairing it is arrogance on your part
Sure start the core operation, it's hard to face him
Cause bars away from an incarceration
I ain't into operations that ain't making me
Cake up cheese, give or take a G
Feel the nature's breeze on my naked knees but for leisure
Do not disturb, I'll kick you keister
Unleash the beast wars, take three-fourths
When I leap forth, I resort to G Force
You better creep soft, watch where your feet walk
Or profile meets chalk by the see-saws
Retard, coincidentally, simply raw
Fill out this entry form
So we can get beyond the nifty song you dissed me on
Now you the new contestant on my truth confessions
Teach the youth a lesson they're not used to getting
I got a team of writers like the king of fighters
That never seem to 'tire
That's the reason why you gotta....

[Refrain]
