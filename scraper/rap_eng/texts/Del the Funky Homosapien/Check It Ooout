Artist: Del the Funky Homosapien
Album: No Need for Alarm
Song: Check It Ooout

Yeah (4x)
Now check this shit out (4x)
Now this first shit, is about me...

[Verse 1]
When it's time for me to recline
I listen to rhymes and beats in the waves of the spine
To the brain
Relievin' pain & anguish
The stangest arrays make me sway and make my day brighta
The hip hop invita
Write arrive a little soona
Check the soles on my Pumas
My attitude is miserable
Cause in my mind I'm sayin' here's a fool I don't like
I won't strike his ass in the face
I'm blastin' the bass in my headphones
A fool don't have to get his head flown
Why waste time with rhymes?
I get straight to the point
Like I HATE when funk's in the joint
When hip hop is playin'
Threatenin' to spray men
Don't threaten me
Or you won't be able to see
When I gouge ya eyes out
I despise doubt
On your part
Like I won't stab you in your heart
My flow is drastic
Serious, sarcastic
My motto is
"Fuuck with me & get your ass kicked."
And that's the key to understandin' me
And if they cool then the foot is what you'll be brandin', B
Yeah...

[Bridge]
Check it ooout (check it ooout)
Check it ooout (check it ooout)
This shit is fat (check it ooout)
You know you like it (check it ooout)
Now peep this shit (check it ooout)
Yo, peep this shit (check it ooout)
Yo, this is for the homies (check it ooout)
This is your shit, your shit so you can be cognitive(check it ooout)
If you can rap
Yeah...

[Verse 2]
I love to peep a rhyme
First of all I'm seein' if my man can keep the time
If he go off beat, and it's on purpose
He gotta come back on beat
Or the effort is worthless
I like ot hear a cool flow
But if it's identical to another, he a fool for it
Ya gotta build
Upon skills
And all that copy that most popular rapper shit can get killed
I like a nigga who is quick-witted
Cause it make me feel like I do, when I come from where my dick split it
And I admit it, it's a joy
When I hear a nigga avoid the wack and make 'em paranoid
I loves niggas who talk shit
Cause that's my department
I got somethin' for anyone who starts shit
Cause I'm relentless
With a sentence
A jail sentence, after I beat you senseless
I like niggas when they add rhymes, mad rhymes
Then I laugh at niggas who fell off but had rhymes
Just some descriptions of what I like to listen to
With my Bruce Banner scanner point of view...

[Bridge]
Peep! Yo peep that shit that nigga talkin' about Bruce Banner (check it ooout)
Fuckin', Incredible Hulk shit (check it ooout)
Peep that shit (check it ooout)
Yo check it out (check it ooout)
Check that shit out (check it ooout)
Yo check it out (check it ooout)
Yo, peep this last shit (check it ooout)
Everybody about to know this shit (check it ooout)
You know what I'm saying, Rolling Stone

[Verse 3]
Now I'm about to clown a bitch
She made my eyebrows twitch
Cause she's rich
Yeah, real funny
She makes some money
For puttin' other niggas down
You nuthin' but a clown
You can't write
And you're not bright
You fail to notice the dopeness
Cause you have no insight
You need to quit
You ain't shit
You need to get a lesson, in hip hop detection
And you're next in my list to jack
It's a fact not fiction
Bitch, stop ya bitchin'
You write articles
I'mma rip apart ya skull
Cause ya dull
Not entertainin'
I'mma put ya brain in orbit
Cause I'm morbid
Thinkin' a new ways to kill ya
And yo
I feel ya
Ya too critical
And ain't got a bit a pull
Just admit it fool
Before we get rid of you
A rolling stone gathers no moss
And now who will pay the cost
And afterwards get lost
Hit the dirt, before you get hurt
I eat stupid bitches like you and a rhyme for dessert
I bet you never get no dick
You make me so sick
So my pistol is loaded...

[Outro]
Hey you check what this ho did?
Yeah I checked that bitch, I checked that bitch
Y'all niggas ain't got to trip, you know what I'm saying, fuck this shit (check it ooout)
Check it out (check it ooout)
Check it out (check it ooout)
Yo, check that shit out (check it ooout)
Rewind that shit and check that shit out (check it ooout)
Check all them three verses out (check it ooout)
Check it out (check it ooout)
Check it out (check it ooout)

(scratching) This is D-E-L
