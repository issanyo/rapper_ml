[Verse 1]
Check my comprehensive catalog of crafts
I'm daft
I battle all like I don't have it all
Avant-garde
Battlestar Galactica
Got rhymes per capita
I'm shining through the aperture
But I'm not gonna bust no caps for ya (nah)
That's another genre
I'm the black bomber
Track charmer
Sack burner
Distract burdens
If it ain't that urgent
Nerve prints
Word sentinel invisible infidel interstellar
Hella clever
Endeavors immeasurable
With only heaven to go incredible
Melodramatic wit tales from the tablet
You fail cause you average
Regardless of your sales and your status
You extra baggage
I bamboozle like I'm mobbin' in a Landcruiser
Down MacArthur
Artistic archer
Autistic misfit
You'll get the sickness
When I spit the wickedness
And split cha wig like Kid Icarus
Leave you headless like Ichabod
I infuriated, tick you off
Stick to Pop
Hip-Hop's too difficult
To me, it's a cult
Lyrics lacerated, slit cha throat
Beat cha brain down like Piscopo when sniffin' coke
I don't know, Diff'rent Strokes
So respect me 'fore I whip out ol' Betsy
Surgically remove you from my testes
Purposely improve you just to see who the best be
But sold up sexy
Take a poll and know the prestige
What?
Large lefty (Yeah)
I automate
Animate
My soul sanitation like I gotta canvas painting
Manifestions

[Hook]

Eh, who's ever hearin' this
Deltron-Z be a lyricist
Frontin' on your fake false appearances
"Press Rewind" (Sadat X sample)
Drive you delirious
Dead serious
The eeriest mic mysterious
Eh peep, who's ever hearin' this
Deltron-Z be a lyricist
Frontin' on your fake false appearances
"Press Rewind" (Sadat X sample)
Drive you delirious
Dead serious
The eeriest mic mysterious

[Verse 2]
Go ahead, try symbiosis
But most rap artist don't have any focus
Think they flippin' chips
Try penny brokers
Kipsco or pennyloafers
Get my album I'll show you how it's done
Del-atrocious
Hella atrocious wit vocals
My throat holds verbal choke holds
Poke holes in ya scrolls
My goals are not rifles
I flow scrimmage like the Micronauts
You might go pop and I might grow crops
Go get the gestapo
You riskin' a pot full of gold
Pull a zodiac sign to halftime
Reenact rhymes from a past life over flashlights
Man, you don't know the half
Dash right to the phonograph
Blow your balderdash
Coordinates confirm
Subordinates will learn
My ordinance is stern so supportin' my firm
Is the only way in this lonely age where you going crazed
Your style is sold and paid for cause I made more
Water emcees like on bay shore
Bullets graze doors (Where)
In Oakland where they lay law
Del is going AWOL with napalm
Eight bombs taped to my arms like the town crier
Now miser
Strider
Spit exciter
Ripping plywood
Forget beef cakin' lyrical cheapskates
Try Del and win the sweepstakes
What I make is so hot, it's seethin'
Off the deep end
Stop your breathin'
Caught cha sleeping
Now you're peaking like you've eaten
A hundred microdots wreck your equinox
Delete every piece of props
Leave your perforated
Curb your hatred
Deserve your matrix in the Word Olympics
Completely furnished wit burners like Ted Turner
I broadcast the classics
Fabu-lass, fa-tastic

[Hook]

Peep, who ever hearin' this
Deltron-Z be a lyricist
Frontin' on your fake false appearances
"Press Rewind" (Sadat X sample)
Drive you delirious
Dead serious
The eeriest mic mysterious
Hey, who ever hearin' this
Deltron-Z be a lyricist
Frontin' on your fake false appearances
"Press Rewind" (Sadat X sample)
Drive you delirious
Dead serious
The eeriest mic mysterious

[Del]
And the survey says
Go pratice or something man
You know
Peace
"Press Rewind" (Sadat X Sample)
Ah-hah
