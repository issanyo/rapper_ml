Intro:
Dr. Bombay, Dr. Bombay
Yo, we got a patient in the front
That's ahhh... suffering from an oversized gluttius maximus
And she wanna know can you solve it...

Verse One:
Mistadobalina is a jack-ass, much like a donkey
And I'ma pin the tail on the funky
Has anybody seen Del? Head swelled
Cause I get paid well, kickin much tail
Drink me a forty as I ride my rhinoceros
You don't like it? Well you gots to kiss
Where the sun don't shine, something like my behind
I lose a fan but I'ma be fine
Dr. Feelgood, didn't think I still could
Make it funky real good
Take it then I looped it
Make you say -- GLORYHALLASTUPID!!
The Motorbooty make you shake your rump
To the brand new D-Funk
Take a chunk cause I'm much like a hunk
To the dark skinned girls with funk in they trunk
Coming from around the way
It's Del better known as Dr. Bombay

Chorus:
Dr. Bombay
He don't stop and he don't play
Everytime I try to catch him he's always running away
(sing it, sing it, sing it)
Dr. Bombay
Could you find time and could you stay
Cause the funk is guaranteed to make my day
(It's, so, funky!!)

Verse Two:
Large as a black woman's gluttius maximus
And the question everybody's asking us
"Where'd you get your funk from"
A brother named George and some 151's
So Let's Take It To the Stage you suckers
I jam, and Mistadobalina eats smut
Back in the house with the crew Hieroglyphic
Now you know everything is terrific
Funk in the 1990's that's ironic
So grab you a sack of that chronic
Down with Da Lench Mob straight from the ghetto
But I'm under the sun in the meadow
Me and Miss Amazon sittin on my lap
Butt so big when she walk it clap
Doin the hoochie coochie in the forest
Y'all know who I am so girls sing the chorus

Chorus:
Dr. Bombay
He don't stop and he don't play
Everytime I try to catch him he's always running away
(Has anybody seen that...)
Dr. Bombay
Could you find time and could you stay
Cause the funk is guaranteed to make my day
(sing it, sing it, sing it)
Dr. Bombay
He don't stop and he don't play
Everytime I try to catch him he's always running away
(Dr. Bombay)

Verse Three:
Watch your watch, cause if your spouse calls
Del's gonna damn sure make a house call (hello?)
You peeped out my drawers on your fence
I'm a dog, so you might see paw prints (woof)
(Whattup Doc?) Wait, it ain't cool to jock
Cause you're real far from a ballerina
So ohhh ohhh, Mistadobalina
Freeze, and get up off your knees
Everything that Dr. Bombay say
Is guaranteed to make your day
So OOPS upside your head
I like Club Med hangin out with the dreads
And girl if you ain't got a germ
I won't hesitate to pull out my Funky Worm
But if you ain't down with Del funk
Cancel your appointment and please get the hell on (see-ya!!)
Cause I won't have fraudulent foes
Under my nose, if you won't eighty-six the clothes
Get out the way, so I can save the day
Cause I'm Dr. Bombay

Chorus:
Dr. Bombay
He don't stop and he don't play
Everytime I try to catch him he's always running away
(Peace to the Boogiemen)
Dr. Bombay
Could you find time and could you stay
Cause the funk is guaranteed to make my day
(I hate having to wait)
Dr. Bombay
He don't stop and he don't play
Everytime I try to catch him he's always running away
(D-E-L and Hieroglyphics, hahahahaha)
Dr. Bombay
Could you find time and could you stay
Cause the funk is guaranteed to make my day
Dr. Bombay
He don't stop and he don't play
Everytime I try to catch him he's always running away
Dr. Bombay
Could you find time and could you stay
Cause the funk is guaranteed to make my day
(Ice Cube and DJ Pooh)
Dr. Bombay
He don't stop and he don't play
Everytime I try to catch him he's always running away
Dr. Bombay
