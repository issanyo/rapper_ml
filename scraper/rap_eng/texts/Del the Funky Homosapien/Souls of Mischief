[Phesto]
Kaboom! The Jedi’s back to seismic
Shock ya, I’m the doctor
With the donor organ I amputated from your body, shotty
I got equipped with slingshots to fling rocks and clean clocks
I’m leaving emcees in comas, traumatized
In conniptions when I flips my scionic powers
It’s been hours, since you cowards
Got devoured, when I showered these
Catastrophic flows, I’m overwhelming foes
‘Cause Phesto’s rhetoric’s the sedative bestowed
Upon ya, misdemeaning the schemes when I shift your blisters
(Busta Rhymes: “Always misbehaving and mischievous”)

[A-Plus]
Yo, now I gotta kill a nigga quicker than AIDS virus
Will a hoe try the flyest? ‘Cause I just
Know that fools will never know the half and then I laugh
‘Cause I never sweat none of them niggas from Telegraph
And I never ever front, but I pull a clever stunt
And I do it better so I bet it’s what you want
Give me the props and while you’re at it, get off the penises
Of the Keener kids, you seen I did
Destruction, what’s in store, skins for me
‘Cause I am the man and you can only pretend to be
A-P-L, you know the rest is history
X is finsta be flexin’ instantly
Since it be my turn, I burn like VD
Venereal Disease and I bury all emcees
Souls of Mischief, my bros hoes can get with
I suppose that a foe knows who is gifted

[Opio]
I’m sly, swift like a stiff spring breeze
Swing schemes of a nature that is mischievous
My soul is into this, render this
Mic property, properly
Or I’ll pop ya, G, see I got to be
Incarcerated, hated by the boys in blue, poison you
Pose a threat, if you wanna step then I can voice a few
Verses, curses never catch me ‘cause I’m crafty
Nasty like your bitch getting rich on the ave, see
I’m a vandal and I think the vast majority that bore of me
I’m well-endowed, shroud the head with a beanie
Now I’m feeling camouflaged, my bat is lodged in your ribcage, meany
Miney mo, find me, Joe could cross me on the PM
Creepin’, crack the cranium when I see him
‘Cause Opio gets even Stevens, tis the season
For swinging bats and taxin’, breaking backs and
Smacking all the suckers ‘cause I’m thieving

(A-Plus: Ayo, who’s it on?)

[Tajai]
Tajai ‘cause I’m flyer than invites
And when mics are gripped, dips flip
The bat will then hit with the stiff one
Gets funds for freakin’ words and herds of huns
Now chumps, um, fight ‘cause I hit more skins than sunlight
So one plight is equal to the flight
Heads, bob or crack as Louisviller flies opponents
And frauds get jelly or come crummy like the donuts
Chewy, many have said when I envelop folks
I can come flyer than sex on Hubble telescopes
Hella folks are heathen, there’s no reason for existence
Persistence to drive then you die; why bother
I shoos off foes like Japanese restaurants
The best ain’t gots to practice, I bat kids and adults
Ask folks why, because I’m leavin’
Ayo fuck this shit, man, I’m out…
