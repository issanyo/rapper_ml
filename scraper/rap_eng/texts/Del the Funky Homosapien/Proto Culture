[Chorus]
Let me tell you about the Proto Culture
If you don't know the culture, here's the whole structure
We've had enough of the lackluster-trust us
We get the kind of games you can't rent at Blockbuster
KU: Game related, raise it bit by bit
Yo D, link up the cable we'll go hit for hit
Phantasma plasma particle beam means I have ya
On the run-the rendered effects hot like magnas

[Del]
I play games by Capcom with a power glove strapped on
On any platform, I don't spend my dough on Phat Farm
Video games, I got many to play
Before my life expires; fufill my desires

[KU]
Mastering your hardest boss
Shattering all stars across
Ain't hard to cross the finish line
Floatin' on Daytona
Wex, Gex or Klonoa, we get 'em all at cost
RPG, Platform we transform like Macross

[Del]
Rival schools, Batsu
Purchase you ought to
It came with one free CD, it's like I bought two
I hope they make part II for Dreamcast
Cause games I've seen in mags, you won't believe they have!

[KU]
Getting callouses turning over asteroids
Graviton bombs destroyed
Getting moms annoyed
Now I'm hacking Nightmare Creatures
Features splatter 'cross the screen
Get more clean each year

[Del]
I remember my homie Ed Coats had the most
A Colecovision-every week I'd visit
Playing Donkey Kong Jr., Venture, Roc'n Rope
Games I thought was dope
While my moms was watching soaps

[KU]
I'm on the next level
I got a double barrel shotgun in the Doom world
Waiting on the next devil
Armor's low-check the arsenal
Rupture the main conductor playin Disruptor

[Del]
I remember Ninja Gaiden
Finish it finally
With Ramone wouldn't answer the phone
This was before getting blown
I own the first Nintendo Power
With the maps of Zelda Help me conquer in an hour

[Chorus]
Let me tell you about the Proto Culture
If you don't know the culture, here's the whole structure
We've had enough of the lackluster-trust us
We get the kind of games you can't rent at Blockbuster
(2X)

[Del]
Hey KU you know my SEGA collection is massive
Got all the past hits and classics
Herzog Zwei now Panzer Zwei
Originality that made me a fan today

[KU]
It's Pandemonium-it's like Toys R Us
Flippin the next Saturn game brings out the boys in us
It's poisonous
Taking out the boys in blue in Grand Theft Auto
Snatch a Rolls Royce to use

[Del]
Yeah, I'll admit it Playstation improved
Come visit Feudal Japan with me and Tenchu
Bushido Blade 2 with sword play so accurate
Mega Man Legends but I had to buy a map for it

[KU]
I'll fence Hyo to get a Neo-Geo
For Samurai 64 in full rendered splendor
Rival counter and enter my swords in his innards
My joint was playing Leonardo wuppin' on Splinter

[Del]
I gotta get Xenogears-that's the type of game that relieves my fears
Get it from overseas to here
I gotta get Psychic Force
Authentic arcade that I can endorse
They got me liking imports

[KU]
I'll need to be at the next E3
What's the next CD I need to see
Me and D signing checks
Let's float overseas, mingle with game companies
Giving tips to Capcom and Sega-can't front on these

[Del]
To anyone who knew me better
Know I chose Saturn first Cause it's 2-D heaven
Bernie Stolar dropped the ball with the RAM cartridge
X-men Vs. Streetfighter could've expanded the market

[KU]
Marvel Vs. Capcom-beyond fathom
Tell the truth, Playstation ain't ready to have 'em
Come on I'll bring the onslaught
Alpha and Omega
Khaos Unique brought to you by SEGA

[Chorus]
Let me tell you about the Proto culture
If you don't know the culture, here's the whole structure
We've had enough of the lackluster-trust us
We get the kind of games you can't rent at Blockbuster
