[Verse 1: Del]
Mista, twista, getcha
Every single time and I rhyme like I know so I flow
With the gifted tongue and the cryptic brung
New phrases into the mazes
Play this
Two times a day with the day-o
Day-ay-ayo and the daylight come
I plum forgot what a wack rhyme was
Because I buzz like a bee in the ears of my peers
So they know, and I know, we all know, day-o
Daylight come and me wanna go home
Cool
No tool, no Smith and Wesson
Just an opposite so I can pop a bit of
Shit on the mic when I get on the mic
"B-b-b-bam!" I ricochet a bit on the mic
And I like it, just like the girl on Ahonetwo
D-E-L will C-R-U-S-H anyone who
Makes advances when I'm incognito
Veto is the answer when I prance upon your skull like a Frito
Finito, but I ain't finished
'Til I let the flipside ride 'til the rhythm is diminished

[Verse 2: Casual]
I would if I could but I ain't 'cause I cain't
Time for me to lay down the law. Who's raw?
You saw the views from the shoes of the writer
Stronger than a Cisco and you're like a cider: watery
Try to win the lottery before you try to slaughter me
Because I'm not the G
To be stepped to, kept you on your toes
As my rep grew, I leapt through negative foes
So you better get flows to counteract what we’ve done
Received one good 'cause I’m armed like a sleeve, son
Plead dumb and step back as I wreck shop
Collect respect, props and deck the next prop artist
The hardest is the one who don’t pass out
If Tyson’s last name was Rophone, I’d knock his ass out
The bigger the better, the better the bigger is
Whenever you figure this nigga is gettin’ his
Be real and don’t kill with flaws the ill cause
Just answer to the boss
And that’s when ya lost
Keep on losing, I'm using many tactics
I yearn to earn more green than Saint Patrick
And I make backs if you get caught frontin'
Never bought a Newport but I puff a blunt'n

[Verse 3: Tajai]
I needs no sugar crisp to get swift
So what with two syllables exemplifies the gift? Tajai
I sense those who try to scale my ladder
Bladders release upon your porch if you don’t cease
I respond with beats and will distraction
When I see one fatter than Rerun, so What’s Happening?
It’s not where you’re from, it’s just how you come
Correct, respect the roughneck ‘cause ‘nuff get
Bucked and tucked into their beds like “nighty, nighty"
Deft of the membrane, none left ‘cause I am a righty
Fight these, you’ll catch volleys for your follies and mistakes
I stick fakes with shanks, so no thanks
Wack shit, your attempts to rap are ineffectual
I get in butt styles like a hard-up homosexual
Not for sex when you’re at the intersection of damage
Sandwich knuckles are what your luck pulls
Bad ones, catch one or two, rather a few
A slew for soft ass phonies plus your cronies
Try me, you’ll catch my Vans in your hiney
That’s if my back grip slips though I doubt it
Pout if you want to, covertly to find me
But I See’s more than them Candies, nothing gets by me
So play the tracks, and you’ll go out like Betamax
Next to Tajai 'cause I kicks the greater tracks

[Verse 4: Opio]
Sce-beep-boop
Bob your head to this, mischievous, soul societal
Idle chatter never slips off the lips of this writer
Might not be the greater innovator of the rhyme scheme
My style is the Visine to get your eyes opening
This Raggedy Andy gets dandy like a lion in the meadow
While the teapots blow off steam like a kettle
You're hip-to-the-hop I kick; I trip the light fantastic
Gettin' into the groove better than a phonographic
The vandal with the vocals making the locals go insane
The regal rhymer speaks sustenance for the brain
Get frisky with the phrases as you praise us like divinity
The one of liberated soul controls for infinity
Got style by the square mile, cats got a vibe child
Hieroglyphics will uplift the rhythms for the meanwhile
Articulate my lingo as I mingle in my medium of speech
And peace to prop prophets as I ponder and teach
A smidgen of religion to the fraudulent
Listen, pay attention, I’m the master of this convention
Kick the wicked-and-wiley-styley while you’re stuttering just like Smiley
Skipping shingles of your shattered dreams, too bad it seems you tried me
The wise and wordy wizard pays a visit to your subconscious
Crush your wonderland, extinguish all the nonsense
Optimistic, stylistic, mystic myth, I’m swift
Like Mercury, mercy me, I'll surely shoot the gift

[Verse 5: A-Plus]
People call me souped just because I'm living fat
People call me nasty: it's because I eat the cat
And I swing a bat to level heads, leaving devils dead
Never said never ‘cause a clever head's better
Dreads locked on the top of my crop, never flaky
If this was a field then Bo Jackson couldn’t shake me
Bake me, Betty Crocker’s oven isn’t hot enough
If you wanna spread the skins then I got a lotta stuff
Not a bluff, got a tough guy thinkin’ twice
Why step? ‘Cause a fly rep, I kepts, my step ladder
I had a fatter spliff I was hittin’ on
Now it’s just a smidgen, like a pigeon, I’ll be shittin' on
Sittin' on a futon, slippin' my Timb boots on
I’m the type of brotha that ya have to get ya troops on
Oops, I'm sorry 'cause I didn't mean to dis you
I could hook a ho and make her blow like I was tissue
Mary had a little lamb, Adam got a lotta dough
Need help with your garden? Skyline got a lotta hoes
Yo, I didn't mean hoes, yo, I meant women
If she got the pool, I got the trunks; let's go swimming
Dip, dip, dive 'cause I'm live
Liver than five or ten of the men on my jock, you don't stop
Here a pimp, there a pimp, everywhere a pimp pimp
This A-Plus grades the quiz, so there it is
