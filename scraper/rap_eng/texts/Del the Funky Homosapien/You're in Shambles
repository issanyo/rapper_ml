1st to bat, steppin' up to the plate is...

[Verse 1: Del The Funky Homosapien]
I'm the monster comin in closer, I'll roast ya'
Not never worried 'bout competition
Listen, I can twist men into pretzels, my jet skills can outrun
'Cause it's fun, I'm not done
One or even two could even try, It's not a even try
I'll leave 'em cleavin', why did you do it?
I'mma school kids and tease 'em and please 'em
For the treason, that's the reason I'mma squeeze 'em
Make 'em tell and make 'em dwell, they're not dead
I got lead, but I won't use it, I'll refuse it 'cause they're losin'
I'll be merciful, I won't hurt the skull, with the hollow tip
I'll make sure they follow tips, that I tell 'em
I won't spell 'em, out, they'll shout, in horror
'Cause they saw a metamorphis, I'mma force kids out the galaxy
So, now ask me, don't try to go around because I know the sound
They're not stealthy, I'm dope, the opposers
I make sure you chose the straight and narrow
Prepare though, and be careful

[Hook x3]

You had your chance..."

[Verse 2: Del The Funky Homosapien]
Now, peep this, they forgot and now they gonna rot
They didn't know that they could sell a lot (a lot)
Of trash 'cause it doesn't smash or last, they got cash, but now
How are you gonna survive because you strive to gamble?
You're in shambles and I'm glad I could add flavor
I'm the savior, misbehavior can catch hell, none can match Del
Unless they stress, fresh, I'm nonetheless and take a guess
The one that make 'em go run back and tell they crew
That Del is true, he tell a new way to say whatever's clever
I'm gonna sever necks of those who don't respect the rap legacy
Because I egg MC's on the late night
They got away writin' clever raps
'Cause with that bullshit it sounds like they never rapped
In they life, I got a knife that is lyrical
And Del is causin' fear and still has potential (potential)
They didn't learn, now the money's gonna burn
I yearn to make rap better, let's stick together!

[Hook x3]
