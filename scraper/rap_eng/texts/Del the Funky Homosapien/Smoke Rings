[Intro]
You're right, I am a rotten bastard
I admit it
But I'll tell you something
Even though I've got a lot of hate inside
I've got some friends who ain't got hate inside
They're filled with nothing but love
Their only crime is growing their hair long
Smoking a little grass and gettin' high
Lookin' to the stars at night

[Verse 1: Dirty J]
This is ridiculous, I have a sickness
The grass is always greener, I said fuck it, burn the picket fence
Pestilence, eyes rolled back, pure masculine
Moody little bitches I'm force-feeding you some estrogen
Always keep you wet, see, mermaid pussy
Ever seen the movie Kids, no legs, don't push me
I am making sculptures, you are using plaster
Screaming while your dreaming MCs need a dream catcher
You're not in my mind, you can't get the concept
You're not on my level, you might need a dubstep
Walking to the death, not walking with a cleft - lip
Sharp as an arrow tip, I'm just so sick of it
The smell is your upper lip
And I'm jacking off a sparrow while I'm crashing a pirate ship
Slow as molasses, quick as a whip
This beat's a filthy toilet, and I'm the fucking shit

[Chorus: Dirty J + (Duddy B) + Both]
Rollin' up some grass, call it weed, huh
(Landing on your feet, call it speed, huh)
Nothing but love, gettin' high up as the stars as night

[Verse 2: Duddy B]
My feet rock steady, my heart beats heavy
My well ran dry, had no luck at the levee
I'm lyrically a genius, like Fergie and Jesus
It's like a lightning bolt hit the tip of my penis
The opposite of cleanest, parallel with passed out
One sip away from runnin' round with my pants down
Apparently I'm underground, sound-breaking barriers
Everybody take cover, danger area
I got a feeling this beat's been to Hell and back
You can see the hole stickin' straight through my Raider cap
Smoke rings billow out the window of my Cadillac
This beat is the weed, and I'm the fucking cataract

[Chorus: Dirty J + (Duddy B) + Both]
Rollin' up some grass, call it weed, huh
(Landing on your feet, call it speed, huh)
Nothing but love, gettin' high up as the stars as night
Nothing but love, gettin' high up as the stars as night

[Verse 3: Del tha Funky Homosapien]
[These are?] like rap-rock, my mascot is Sasquatch
Rap for the have-nots, thieves get a padlock
[That all a black ball?], if not call Matlock
I'ma slap box with your ass while I snap shots
Dunces that think outside the box and outfox proud cops
As soon as the style drops, I'll leave your towel mopped
I'm wild high, more arms than an octopus
More buttons than I could push, to ignite ya tush
I manufacture the type of goods
That keep the Africans bootlegging the new President
New resident in the White House
Like a night owl, with the lights out, provide the right route
Parasites pounce and nibble on whatever they can fiddle with
Which ain't much, cause they illiterate
Hit ya like a dirty syringe from a personal friend
Thirty shurikens, inserting inside your skin

[Chorus: Dirty J + (Duddy B) + Both]
Rollin' up some grass, call it weed, huh
(Landing on your feet, call it speed, huh)
Nothing but love, gettin' high up as the stars as night
Nothing but love, gettin' high up as the stars as night
