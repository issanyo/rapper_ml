[Intro: Del]
Yo
This is Deltron
The name of this joint is
"The Melding of Minds"
Dig it

[Verse 1]
Deltron Osiris, I'm ruling the underworld
All mentally dead, arrise and confer
Now y'all gonna have to leave the room
Cause I'm caustic, ya might get your ego bruised
This ain't a sequel, it's season two
Won't be broadcasted on the evening news
Y'all won't believe the view, it's subdued
People with no way to go, nothin' to do
I encompass the moon
With lunar power afloat it's so fluid
When and ever, cause I win in effort, forever
That's bigger and better, beyond measure
Undergo my process of understanding
Assimilating, absorbing knowledge as the hand swings
Clockwise eyes that I engage for the purpose of
Acquiring skill, while the situation worsens

[Refrain: Zach de la Rocha & Del]
[Z:] No casual contact, so fuck the format
Crowd get rushed when I crush this beat flat
[D:] Consider this a melding of the minds
A secret message transmission to all kind
[Z:] And the scene gets raw when they see this
Apocalyptic pyre eclipse
[D:] Hear with the third eye receptor
Make the effort, cause we taking drastic measures

[Verse 2]
Cleverly disguised as rap format
But actually a weapon against psychic attack
And to be aware of cognitive
Preference, so learning stress
Is lessened to not even the question
Got any suggestions? Let's hear it now
Before I take this rocket launcher to this building, and clear it out
Yeah we're in town, no need to fear
Unless you're greedy and completely in a weird
Place where you can't understand, that one man can't possibly
Have everything the eye can see
What happened is the future generations
Meaning right now, gotta pay reparations
And we taking extra helpings cause we felt it
Skullcaps get melted with radiation belts
In the atmosphere, use the stimuli to give 'em my
Personal fuck you, duck, before I buck you

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
With needles and threads, trying to sew him back
After his neck explodes, fade to black
Deltron Osiris, he made it back
To the underground Matrix, a maze for the haters
A place where danger's seldom brought in
If so, we got fire power fuck the talkin'
Chalk it, mutants and random zombies
Looking for crack nuggets, that's disgusting
Poonanny pushers talkin' about "Find me in the bushes"
I'll find you, with a fine for looking
In my direction, my eye detects it
Like a private eye detective with lie deception
My kind of method for extracting info?
Clappin' if they happen to keep they lips closed. Unload-
Barrels like oil spills, avoid real people who live on the upper crust
It wasn't us

[Refrain 2]
[Z:] No casual contact, so fuck the format
Crowd get rushed when I crush this beat flat
[D:] Consider this a melding of the minds
A secret message transmission to all kind
[Z:] And the scene gets raw when they see this
Apocalyptic pyre eclipse
[D:] How can money be spent
In a land where money holds no value? Count your cents

[Verse 4]
The government fakes aid to invade they enemies
Take they energy and enslave they families
Now the planet reverted to cave man mentality
May trade your child for somethin' to eat
And a six pack "Yo bro, where'd ya get that?
Yo I'll trade ya for this troll
You can work 'em till he get old
And then sell him in the food farm
Where they harvest the elderly for hamburger"
And that's murder! Ah we gonna stop that
Soon as we got that, red alert
It was time to hit the dirt
Mission first, cause the war ain't over
More on a covert level like COBRA
Against GI Joe, who be my foe in this case
Cause the government was lyin' in the first place
That's the worst tastin' soup I ever had
Heated over the burning trash, in a can
