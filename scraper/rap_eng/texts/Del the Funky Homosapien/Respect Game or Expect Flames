[Verse 1: Casual]
Respect game or expect flames
I connect with the select, what he meant, I collect chains
Manila folder, the realest soldier, the illest spiller
Still a killer, realer than villains in it for scrilla
The way your boy spits you'd think he had Tourettes
Came all the way from Oakland and y'all hoping I'm wet
Soaking, they know it's not as dope as it get
Don't get broken by the opening act, now check it out y'all
Casual, J. Rawls, we make shit to escape the fake
The matrix, then spread love like Take 6
No need to try to motivate for fake chicks
I play flav girl, you get the eight six
We call lampin, J. Rawls, Casual
Smash Rockwellington the west coast champion
Now check it out

[Hook]
Respect game or expect flames
Respect game or expect flames
Respect game or expect flames
Respect game or expect flames
Respect game or expect flames
Respect game or expect flames

[Verse 2: Casual]
Hatin' - it's not a part of me dawg
Bomba-rass blood clot like your arteries clogged
You started me, you ought to be regarding me
Your artistry's god when rocking crowds is a part of the job
I get harder than the vice squad, dirtier than hoarders
Placin' a drug order at the border
Court order stoner thought of as more of an oracle
Collect, respect, then erect mic memorials
A type tutorials, too hype for your mic warriors
Machete sharp music, make confetti out your albums
To floor ya, boy call your lawyer
Before the lord just destroy ya
Soul music, hip-hop or rock, jazz, funk
This is classical Casual, punk

[Verse 3: Del tha Funkee Homosapien]
Me and Cas used to have science class together
And you could tell when we come combine raps together
Nigga this the best chapter of the book
Where we mastered every nook and cranny of the rap anatomy
Black reality, black mentality
Any technicality we just handle it, casually
Mouths to feed so we pound the streets, like a pachyderm
Make sure that our raps is heard
Hieroglyphics yeah that's the first, time you heard the grandmaster's verse
But now a miraculous turn of events in the present tense
Got us here to prove that hip-hop grew in spite of fools
That would like to choose dollar signs over rhymes that timeless
You can't take it with you, don't deny it
I do this shit for Richard Pryor or Red Fox and Rudy Ray Moore
You say it raw, true to the core
Respect game or expect flames when the set bang
