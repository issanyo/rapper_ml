[Verse 1: Busdriver]
You collapse the internet in five seconds flat
With megapixels of your image and in our digestive tract
Wanted for 9 consecutive acts
Of cyber crime, man bide your time
You be considered by every white executive a catch
We used to watch Spongebob and eat Dove bars
Now you get tug jobs from drug czars
We'd put smug broads in punk bars
Now you're with young stars and the Nickelodeon red carpet
They would never pick a Blowdian, I am dead starfish
There's a rocket launcher in your camera bag
Your lower lunar scrolls digitized banner ads
Your manager is a Catholic dad
Telling me like listening to my music's like tripping on acid tabs
Well fuck  him, fuck you, fuck this logic session
Interns who transfer your Quicktime files via armored car
Think your drums sound like midgets trapped in an armoire
Lol, hardy har, #farquhar

[Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien]
1.1 million people got access
I got access, Bus got access
22% of the Earth surf regularly
Bus surf regularly, I surf regularly
1.1 million people got access
I got access, Bus got access

(You look like, you look like a pixelated motherfuckin' Natalie Portman, real talk, Yeah)

[Verse 2: Busdriver]
I smell a burning money and lady tears
On press junkets and death hunches
Anger my aging peers
Yeah, this crowd ain't used to rhyming
I'm tryna eat while y'all still food fighting
I'm a polarized goober into fusion dining
While y'all riding motorized scooters with aluminum siding
[?] blue lighting as you roll into K-Mart
Social network wizards monetize my brain fart
The dream seekers have deboned the golden calfs
Fuck her in the beat drum of yogo class
Hanging 90's rappers off the overpass
'Fore I'm smoking grass while romanticizing balderdash
[?] onyx from a saddled dromedary
Tell children you'll deify their bag and pull some strawberries
Told them "we get money"
By the fistful, with a wifi signal on the back of a drum key
My entourage was like some version of Kid Cudi
To ensure that I look like that I'm still in my mid 20's
Fuck your input, put it in your Jansport
My passport a coloring book
Suck the [pig huff] off my
[?] GP, what the fuck is a CD?
Send an 18 year old to your online store
I made a jet stream, internet meme
Should have the manager's wet dream
But then again, ain't got no all-time high score
