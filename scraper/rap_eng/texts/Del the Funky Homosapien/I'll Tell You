It must’ve took you many moons to become so ignorant that it
Isn’t any use / You should really think before you speak / Cause
Every time you open your mouth nigga, I peep / You gotta
Platinum chain, you got a platinum brain / Not one single fact
Remains / Don’t speak upon my acts and ways / When your dumb
Ass can’t hack half the pace / Huh you a public speaker / Can’t
Say shit to you without it leaking / A meeting of the minds /You
Like to sling mud till the enemy is blind / Huh, you got the worse
Cavities spreading peoples business like you eat dirt sandwiches
/ Your life if sure scandalous / You love gossip lots of it and you
Can’t resist

Chorus

Please don’t get it misconstrued, if you missing a clue then, I’ll
Tell you
Fools quit trying to twist the news, you wanna get the truth then
I’ll tell you
You wanna know how you can do it with style, when you putting it
Down, I’ll tell you
Del will do that and mo’ but if you not sure homeboy, let me tell
You

You know you phony / Talking about me when you know the story
/ Conversation ancient territory / You at a loss of words whenever
Thoughts is heard / It isn’t true seeing something you thought you
Heard / You need to concentrate just to drop a turd / Tell the other
Half of your body / To wipe the other ass cheek after you potty /
You masking probably / I probably did this and that you never
Saw me / Try mastering your ABC’s and you can graduate
Kindergarten while you’re in your teens / Ha, ha, ha, now you
Wilding in the streets / Lying about niggas so now you in a beef /
We allowin’ you to eat / So chill cause you can’t eat without your
Teeth

Chorus

Please don’t get it misconstrued, if you missing a clue then, I’ll
Tell you
Fools quit trying to twist the news, you wanna get the truth then
I’ll tell you
You wanna know how you can do it with style when you puttin it
Down, I’ll tell you
Del will do that and mo’ but if you not sure homeboy, let me tell
You

In my book your worth a listen / But then again it’s a work of
Fiction / You be in hibernation cause you never catch one word
That I be saying / But nah, you can speak for yourself / And 80
Others that you seeking to tell / Everything about can’t wait to
Bring it out, cause it’ll sting your mouth / But have a mind of your
Own / Don’t give away pieces to others / Or you gonna to find
Yourself in shit that’s deeper than cover / The station you
Listening on is misinformed / You think you getting warm on a
Distant farm / The shit that you spit is wrong, its fabrication / You
Have a fascination for inaccurate data / You don’t need a head
Just a hand in the rotator / Yeah, that’s a fact, its a fact that it’s
Made up

Chorus

Please don’t get it misconstrued, if you missing a clue then, I’ll
Tell you
Fools quit trying to twist the news, you wanna get the truth then
I’ll tell you
You wanna know how you can do it with style, when you puttin it
Down, I’ll tell you
Del will do that and mo’ but if you not sure homeboy, let me tell
You
