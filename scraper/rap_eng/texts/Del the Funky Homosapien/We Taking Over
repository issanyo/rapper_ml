[Verse 1: Tame One]
Rappers act like they don't know
I know I don't act like no rapper
At least none of the ones y'all jockin', going after
My era is Ghetto Bastard, Time 4 Sum Aksion
Gang Starr, Tribe Called Quest, [?] BackSpin
Main Source, Nas, King T, Alkaholiks, The Boot Camp
Big Daddy Kane, Christopher Wallace, [?] B.I.G
Leaders of The New School, EPMD
But these days, with so called DJs that can't cut shit
Might as well be Hammer Can't Touch This
I remember the Wu debut, last of the truth
Today's youth just be sounding ass in the booth
Speaking of ass in the booth
What happened to chicks that repped
Like Digga, Yo-Yo, MC Lyte, Antoinette
It ain't like competition is missing
There's more people spitting than ever
It's just that nobody is kicking it clever
I'm proud to have heard Organized Konfusion and AZ
But lately, this whole past decade ain't amaze me

[Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien & Tame One]
We got something to tell and expose
From Tame and Del and it dwell in the soul
The music we do will never grow old
But the fads'l play out
If you strictly for the cash then stay out
Cuz you're wasting your time and mine
You got to live it up, but now the jig is up
We got this, now give it up
You can put it down now
The game is over and party people rest assured
Cuz we takin' it over

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Yeah, comin' with the assist, DZL he's so hip
Imma tell you mugs about what was the [?] trip
But, don't laugh nigga cuz half the shit you
Think is so Human Torch is [?] porn
Knowledge born with Just-Ice and Lakim Shabazz
Oh then you add Chill Rob G
Probably toss a bit of Kool G Rap in
To really give where it was at then
But you don't hear me though
We didn't even call this shit lyrical
Didn't have a name for it yet
Oh before I forget, MC Lyte was so tight
Kings of Pressure, Latifah, Biz Markie, it gets better
Ultramagnetic, that's what really set it
On the west coast, Ice T he's a legend
King T, DJ Pooh, listening to Run-DMC was the thing to do
If any of that ring true then
Imma bring you to the world of Too Short
That was in the tradition of Dolemite and Blowfly
It was multi-cultural, technicolor scene
When people used to say it was a fad
But it was more than it seemed

[Hook]
