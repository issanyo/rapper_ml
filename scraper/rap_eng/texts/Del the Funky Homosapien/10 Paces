[Verse 1: Del]
Ok you elitist bastards
You think you just going to eat everybody food
And scrape off the neck bone filer
Oh I got to pay for oxygen now
Well well what have we here, dimentia
The devil's alive don't let him enter
Diesel with new beats solo
Drenched in color I hover over bozos
Take No-Doze you need to be aware of this
Wordsmith terrorist, terror rip
Errors get corrected
Swear to god if fools don't start checking theyself
I'ma jump on some next shit
Fireworks tie a jerk to the railroad tracks
Just like Penelope pitstop
Forget me being caught by the anthill mob
Feel the throb of the rhythm portayal
Frequency lay low, you people see Day-Glo
Color when I toss the flow
Not a closed book
These are rhymes you would want to know
Boundaries I love to clown the weak
Minds of ignoramuses when they be playing with my patience
When you know that the doc ain't got no patients
I'ma schedule a personal arrangement
Believe that partner
Think first you can't beat that mantra

[Hook: Del]
Take 10 paces turn around and aim
You take 5 and then you throw some shit in the game
Take 10 paces and aim
I take 2 and I'ma try to topple your brain

[Verse 2]
Your trophies need polish
They always seem to be tarnished
Nostalgia be your counterpoint for argument
Pardon my french you niggas stink
Think how you think but I'm tell you what I think
I'm a genius that's why ya'll ain't peaked yet
The beat is disturbing your readout read deep shit
Executive process musically clearly discussing versatile ingenuity
Examine everybody, weigh the possibilities
I'm dope and great fuck your image it's not real to me
The underwhelming scope be the concept
Plus you lie all the time even when you honest
However my lyrics have graduated
The notion of your place in the environment is exaggerated
Speak sure fallacies while I master world analogies
And break you down to an appleseed

[Hook]
