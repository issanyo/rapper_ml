Think, think, think
You think about it

Think, think, think
You think about it

Watch this ??? radiation from the flamin' hot sun
Known as Hieroglyphics
The light intensity is blazing
Collapse into an angel dust fit
From the dope I spit
Cocaine to your brain
You sick chasin' a dragon
Hollow-tips disintegrate
When I infiltrate your temples with these rap magnetics
Depleting the iron in your hemoglobin
Freeze burnin' a slack apathetic
Who fiendin' for the spotlight
While you plot on me
I write these older soliloquies
You can't see
Your corneas are straight sizzling
Riddling your shell with holes from the shit I bring
Catch you with the black adder poison just for mentioning Hiero fool
You got it twisted like King James
Perversion Persian Gulf syndrome got your mind spinning
Head flown from the eclectic
Fuck up your electrics
No audio, no visual
Your city goes up in flames
No remorse for the slain victims
The same curriculum goes for the next mission
This is the North Star microphone type violence
Pilot wings gunnin' MC's like a F-18 jet fighter
The Spiderman swinging through your neighbourhood
Takin' out your Kingpin
Get inside you like I'm Sabrewolf
I got the killer instincts
I don't blink
Before you get heat seek with the onslaught

Think, think, think
You think about it

Think, think, think
You think about it

Think, think, think
You think about it

Think, think, think
You think about it

If you control a man's thoughts
You don't have to worry about his actions
So think about that
Rather think about it in traction
For a fraction of the cost you could be bossed
But you suffer from inflation cause your mind is straight lost
Why you worrying about us
What's occurring right now is
We makin' power moves and you don't even know how
You fret and fume and claim Hiero is doomed
But your hating won't alter
We still won't falter
We plotting our own maps
We clocking our own snaps
If you think you so smart
Tell me why you ain't known that

Think, think, think
You think about it

(That was stupid, peep)

You think we're weak so
Our fans think we're the dopest
So there's something else for your people mind to focus on
Who wrote this song
The mighty Hiero
You thought we was dead, pfffttt
Alive on arrival
Biofeedback, we'll fry your weave back to the follicles
And shrink your brain to the size of a molecule
Follow you, never, you dumb
I'm like the thinker
Constant elevation, that's why I like to tinker
With rhymes and concepts
So I can stay one step beyond
Learnin' about the planet we on
I'm not sayin' I'm the smartest
But there's a lot of targets
To take my mind to
Cause that's part of being an artist

Think, think, think
You think about it

Think, think, think
You think about it

The magnetic flux inducted when I touch the mic is acupuncture
Fluctuated in the lotus poles through your solar plexus
I bust a rap through a cardiac arrest
The reflex of charges convulse your carcass
Like a heart attack
Then charge you wack emcees for life support
While the mics record
You're a gun done plunging in total blackness
My retrospect is photographic
I got constellations in (Flabacastal?)
To flabbergast you Siamese emcees
The tumultuous maelstrom is bone crushing
On all who approach Hieroglyphics
Too relentless to break your style down to cubic inches
Sterilized like dentures
Paralyzed inventive
Like Jan Matchslinger
I'm not a gat slinger Goldfinger
Niggas is polygamous like bigots
Working for genocide
Everybody knows we rose to preeminence
Sharp witted like diamond tipped rhombuses
Every direction on your compass stabilized
No transfusing the intoxication we profusely drop so fatally
Huh, I think you are spurring a blind horse
We're set to rule the universe with mind force

Think, think, think
You think about it

Think, think, think
You think about it

Think, think, think
You think about it

Think, think, think
You think about it
