Run, run, run

[Verse: Del]
Run fast, can't be quick like the gun blast
Run that back, get some of that no

If it don't add up, [?]

Faucet running, it'll flood in fact
Backed up so need plungers under that
Run through the gossip
Try to run game til they run out of options
Like
Run the globe, [?]
Runny nose, blood on the hands
I can tell now it's about to go down
[?]
When I [?] you could see it for miles
Some don't like the site, they say this foul
Like an alien invasion that swoop through town
[?] weakness in the theater now
So they waiting, that's a limitation
Mental stimulation generated by constant hating
Stocked up, that's constipation
[?] situation
What develops ain't anticipated
