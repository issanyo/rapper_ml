[Hook]

Everything you try to say
Really don't make no sense to me (You don't know nothing!)
The way that you act and misbehave
Really don't make no sense to me (And you think you ?)
The way you front and perpetrate
Really don't make no sense to me (And why you stay frontin')
You act like a bitch and instigate
And it don't make no sense to me (You don't want nothing!)

[Verse 1]

I just don't understand it
I sit and try to figure it out
Why you got such a belligerent mouth
You like a pigeon that sit in the house
Waiting for a monthly check
Talking about she want respect
You can't get none, when you playing the victim
Self-crucifixion
My vision will play out as it was intended
I give a fuck about, who offended!
You should be goody-goody
It could be worse than that
When you launch your personal attacks
Take your sambo off when you greet me
You ten feet beneath me
Thinking you gonna impeach me
Then wave the white flag
The treaty will never get signed
Your twisted mind ain't really as sick as mine
My X-factor
Stress hackers trying to get passed it
Blast it!
Confounded by my terrorist announcements
Drown 'em in a lake of tears
Take their fears and humanize them
Brutalize them, do the right thing
Quit acting like you the mic king
Or get hit by the verbal Viking
Hurling lightning
Serving ice cream
To fiends is pure excitement


[Hook]

[Verse 2]

I'm the courageous cadet
Penetrating your set
With the ways of a vet
Reign of the tech-nique
It's bleak for pipsqueaks
From here to Mozambique
They know that's deep
With flows that freak syllables
Like a silly ho, with no game
Take over your whole brain
No pain, no gain
So you gonna suffer fucking with the cadence crusher
You hate to love it, but you love to hate it
Wanna see me underrated forever
It's better if I get no cheddar, for you!
But it's bad for me
You download my whole discography and never bought a CD
Feeling froggishly, your jaw get beat
With a battle ram
With the speed and the force of an avalanche
What Del do, surely overwhelm you
When I'm at the helm the realm is Bellevue
You're like Scooby Doo in World War II
The mystery is solved
To get to see it all
Awesome!
How I stir the cauldron
To keep you playing possum in your microcosm
