Xzibit intro:
Yes yes. Ahh ahh. Bring it live
Yo it's the X to the Z from the Likwit Squad

Hook:
"One MC" "After" (x3)
"On the mic"- Souls Of Mischief

[Xzibit]
All that get money, take money, sound funny
So I stick to my own, I can feel it in my bones
These clones and clowns ain't really down
Play the background
Westbound, huntin' down pussy like a bloodhound
Plus I feel that no style is darker than mine
You can stick that in the places where the sun don't shine
All you one hit wonders only in it for the spotlight
Spend half-a-million dollars still don't sound tight
Bring truth to the light
I write rhymes for the under
Blunt smokin', bottle crackin', all day slumber
Who wouldn't give a fuck if the world fell down
As long as I can twist a fat one and pass it around
Mr. X to the Z from the Likwit Crew
LA to LVN with my man EQ
Coming live and direct for your neck like this
Come home and smoke a spliff in the Benz with Swift
I stay fucked up

[Hook]

[Del]
Lyrically ingenious my flows are intravenous
Kids are squeamish, when they attempt the reflex
I'm the Apex, shows get rocked
Afterwards, rolls the pot, hold your Glock
Your whole goal is props, you'll never get 'em
My rhythm just fluctuates
You can't O.D. no matter how much you take
I rush your plates, crackin' lenses
They're clean like Benzene, cool like Menthol
My shit's the end all
Major league, gauge your speed, slow your roll
You lie and like Pinocchio your nose will grow
Let's go, underground compress coal
Bust these jewels, these diamonds out
While still some of these niggas don't know what we rhymin' bout
Mind in doubt
Traversing the Earth like zombies
And rocks your dirty laundry
Presented to the world as comedy
Del rip it honestly, that's why the girls are found of me
And don't be squandering your little flow
You ain't got many, your plot's thinning
Reconstitution
You seek contribution from Del for usage
Over these acoustics I take time out for Yusef Hawkins
Representing truth in your Walkman
Locking competition out of studios
Every day I live is like a musical
Create my own score more funkier than Shaft
On my musical path

Hook

[Casual]
They like "Ooh, don't say that." when it's laid on a DAT
Competition, where they at? I diss 'em
Steady at the rhythm
Like a pilot, I keep you silent
Through the turbulence words will get violent
Mega doses exposes his fraudulent composures
All you get is roses on your grave, you misbehave
It's the brave, courageous, lyrically contagious
Spiritually engaged with the psychedelic waves of
An Egyptian, we rips then
Cover the mic like the sun we eclipsin'
'Cause no light shine next to a flow like mine
Casual might ignite the mic for pastime
With one style older than a sundial
My elaborate connection of words is fun how
I display, dismay this way gettin' bizzay
Crack a show off the top while I'm hittin' a J
My immaculate style attackin' with nouns and verbs
For the wack it gets foul
Got a Full Metal Jacket of rhymes compressed
To manifest under pressure
Cas' style a lyrical treasure, nevertheless I get fresher
It's involatile my biological make up composed of flesh and flows
Will dispose of all
When they appear in my crystal ball
I know you wish I fall
Yes y'all
