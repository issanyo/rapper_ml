[Intro/Verse1: Tame One]
(Keep it up)
I know some peeps that's locked up, that'd get your street shot up
So you need to be looking out in case some heat pops up
In the cell, living well, with their feet propped up
Writing letters by the box cause their freaks knocked up
Calling me collect to send fresh tapes up
Taking flicks in front of bricks with their bench weight up
Talking 'bout they coming home to stick the whole block up
Thugging out, acting like they wanna dig Pac up
Kind of mad cause they heard that my group broke up
And if there's beef they gotta go and shoot some folks up
I tell 'em no, but you know how it go-- they're souped up
Ready to spray a nigga from his Tim boots up
Most of 'em had to get bumped when I was getting ?ed up
Now that I'm chilling, more than half of 'em still ?ed up
I try to tell 'em to chill, it ain't safe to act up
I don't want to see my cats locked back up
Heads up, it's going down-- raise up
If you see me around, it's time to blaze up

[Pre-Chorus]
Big up to all my people that's still in the cut
And if you doing your thing, you keep it up
Keep it up
Keep it up

[Chorus: Tame One and Del the Funky Homosapien]
Heads up, it's going down-- raise up
And If you see me around it's time to blaze up
Big up to all my peeps that's in the cut
And if you doing your thing, keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up

[Verse 2:Del the Funky Homosapien]
(Keep it up, yeah keep it up)
Yo, life is complex, but also not so deep
We also know that talk is cheap-- I hear a whole heap
Young niggas haul heat, now, to back it, though
Crack his skull, and let the chopper shred your clavicle
Cops are swarming on any niggas acting like they're not conformists
They're cats that I know, and I tried to warn 'em
Cats warned me when I was young and ornery
On the corner with a sheet of tabs and the streets was bad
Imma do to help brothers if they need a hand
But some motherfuckers really ain't seeing that
Scarface got they mind like hard base
Mike-Tyson-punch-out fists, knockin fronts out quick
I'm like, jay walkin? know how many months I'll get?
Being homeless is illegal, people tell him, "Don't you come round here"
Niggas that be with me everyday
Already got full reign of all my shit
But then they rob my crib
All I know is when you're low, like you're straight stuck
In quicksand, fix that and try to stay up, dude

[Chorus]

[Verse 3a: Tame One]
I know some chicks in the bricks to keep their weaves up
Dimed out, telling brothers they need to ease up
The ones gettin busy, I keep their knees up
And the ones that wanna front, I smoke their trees up
Be in their crib, wilding, drinking their beer up
Taking 'em out boosting, getting my gear up
I can't take 'em out cause they like to act up
Run game on Tame, they might get smacked up

[Verse 3b: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Hoes wanna play house and shack up
Like, that's what's up-- lay on the mattress and fuck
Master of seduction want to capture bucks
Snatch 'em up like a vacuum suck clumps of dust
She can stick around for some laughs and yuks
But after that I gotta smash and raise her ass up
The last duck playing around, gave her a checkup
Told her you won't get much if you don't keep your head up

[Chorus]

[Outro]
