As long as you don't put too much on it

[Verse 1]
[Del]
Tonight we got the mic on cruise
With more luck than horseshoes

[Opio]
While we fuse together like Bruticus
We move with ten ton thrusters

[Phesto]
The cosmopolitan cosmonaut up in your knot again like aneurysms
Expand with wisdom

[Pep Love]
Musical mannerisms are parallel to cannibalism
And animal instinct that's in sync

[Phesto]
Distinct, leaving suckas extinct when we combine
The gravity nullifying physics of mind

[Del]
Inebriating, leave you gaping open
Nothing's safe in Oakland
It's potent and murder is the slogan but

[Opio]
We showing the erosion of the stereotypical
Itching to pull the trigger on niggas
This is all original

[Pep Love]
And brand new, fidgeting with tracks that are rigid and
Pigeonholing rappers while collecting dividends at the door

[Opio]
Ya' know [ECHOES]

[Del]
And that's how it go [Del]

[Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien]
(Who? Who? Who? Who?)
Who the entertainers stompin' through like cross-trainers?
Can't be no plainer
(YOU!)
The remainders couldn't never be that one
Pack 'em in by millions, attendance is platinum

(Who? Who? Who? Who?)
Who the innovators who stimulate like vibrators
With rhymes so major
(YOU!)
Ya' need us to rock a show, hit the pager
Niggas catch vapors when our lyrics hit the paper

[Verse 2]
[Del]
Once again in your dimension, tension personified
Del and Hieroglyphics pollenize
We don't apologize for getting places packed back-to-back
Our rank cranks just about any function
While your memory file is blank
No hankey-pankey jankey stuff going
Down over here, no forms of rats or rodents

[Opio]
My styles fluctuate like the Dow Jones average
While they stay savage
My cassette change shape and transform like ravage or rumble
Make the Earth crumble and separate
Fallin' to the underground
Get into your head like a metal plate
While you sit and wait for these niggas on TV, they hella fake
Hieroglyphics, they can never escape us
The eagle eye, Mach 1 breed, mic crusaders

[Pep Love]
Yes indeed, intuition is the tool in which I use
When enriching you with original stylistics
And the Hieroglyphic ritual is too habitually blow it up
With ballistic attacks
Let me just deal with the facts
Niggas keep it real in they raps but you're not realistic
Perfection and our poetical competitive edge
Is just a reflection of how we feel shit

[Del]
This history's impressionist, microphone specialist
Catchin' bids for putting MCs hearts in my fridge

[Phesto Dee]
The grand inquisitor, exquisite to the osteo
My prodigal product a diabolical melodics
Aquatic is nautical
Motion, Hiero, kenetic flotation, so fuck ya phony radio rotation
My colossal might on the mic is optimum
Hip-hop from the Sequoia Heights populous
Gamma rays like Bruce Banner
Phase your scanner
With mind over matter, I slap the curls out you girl scouts...ya know

[Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien]
(Who? Who? Who? Who?)
Who the entertainers stompin' through like cross-trainers?
Can't be no plainer
(YOU!)
The remainders couldn't never be that one
Pack 'em in by millions, attendance is platinum

(Who? Who? Who? Who?)
Who the innovators who stimulate like vibrators
With rhymes so major
(YOU!)
Ya' need us to rock a show, hit the pager
Niggas catch vapors when our lyrics hit the paper

(Who? Who? Who? Who?)
Are these originators rippin' cuts like sabers
In the hands of Darth Vader
(YOU!)
The remainders couldn't never be that one
Pack em in by millions, attendance is platinum

(Who? Who? Who? Who?)
Who the innovators who stimulate like vibrators
With rhymes so major
(YOU!)
Ya' need us to rock a show, hit the pager
Niggas catch vapors when our lyrics hit the paper

Yeah, Ahh!
