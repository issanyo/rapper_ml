[Intro: Soopa Feen, Spoken]
Haha, yeah
It's Soopa Feen back in the house, baby
Yeah, bitch
Yeah
Yeah, Soopa Feen in the house
Gimme some crack, fool
I ain't no bitch(?) I'm Soopa Feen
I'm the greatest superhero in the universe
Listen to me, fool
Listen to me, I'm Soopa Feen
Chillin
Chillin up in this bitch
Leaping over tall buildings in a single bound
Hey, how much you want for that?
Trade you these shoes (x2)
I'll trade you these shoes
Bitch I'll steal that shit from you
Nigga, I'm Soopa Feen

[Verse 1: Del]
Soopa Feen he used to gleam and glow
Before he became a fiend for blow
Unredeemable
I seen him go insane
Straight from cocaine graduated to no brain
He went from Polo’s to no name
Pawned everything even his gold chain
Now his skin is dingy
He be singeing his lips on a glass tube and pass on food
His ass all glued to the seat of his pants
Got cuts and hella pus on his feet and hands
Completely entranced, Give this nigga a face wipe
Before he meet his contact, Commissioner Base Pipe for new assignments
Cause he said it don’t taste right
He used to cop that hop
So his face might look familiar to some
And now your boy’s plumb dumb
Running around the slums
Sticking out his tongue at young females
He sees trails, he thinks they’re aliens
He starts bellin’ in the precinct, his feet stink
They throw him in the clink
Cause he 5150

[Interlude 1: Soopa Feen, Spoken]
Shit, It's a place to sleep
Beggars can't be picky, you motherfucker
I don't give a fuck if it is in jail
I'll be on the concrete floor
The greatest in the universe
Where my faulty folks at?
Faultor, baby
Come on, Faultor my faulty shiesty folks, come on
You know I need my crack
You get your amphetamines smoked up
We out

[Verse 2: Del]
He got his Garfield and Odie beach towel for a cape
And safety pin he use to clean the screen
(Feen: I was a fiend before I became a teen)
Now he’s a vigilante on Delancey
Then ran to Chancellor looking for his counselor
(His trusty sidekick Faultor) for an ounce or a sack at least
(Feen: (?) the streets and then it's back to sleep)
Well actually he got the master keys
More practices in the crack cave where they got a factory
Soopa Feen is skinny can slide through small areas for quick getaways
While Faultor pull the Derringer
That’s his ace
Shiesty as fuck
His specialty is gafflin' niggas, extorting their bucks
His best power, the invisible gank
If in your wallet there isn’t no bank
He contacts Soopa Feen with telepathy
Saying (Feen: You need crack man? I need some amphetamines)
He’s faster than a speed trip
Stronger than a nigga on ‘ron
He think he a superhero
Pshh, He just gone

[Interlude 2: Soopa Feen, Spoken]
Bitch I ain't gone, yo mama gone
I'm Soopa Feen
I got all my fact-tilities
All my utilities, bitch
I ain't home when I wear this cape cause I be flying
Sky high, sky high motherfucker

[Verse 3: Del]
He can’t really fly but he uses a harness
To leap tall buildings in his undergarments
His teeth are tarnished
He was banished from Berkely
Now he’s up in North Oakland looking really perky
Never think he’s jerky
But he really is
He plays with the neighborhood kids with fizz
Coming out the side of his mouth
Sometimes he hides in the house devisin' new routes
So he could be up out if he see po-po
If they stalkin' while he jaywalkin' looking very awkward
He don’t stay far from the corner where they slang 'caine
He got the mega migraine sort of like his spider sense
That he can’t fight against
Me I’d rather light a spliff
That’s as high as I can get
But Soopa Feen is super human
He got the crystal lungs from the planet base with cream
Will get you sprung
And niggas wanna beat your ass for all the shit you done
But you fight crime in your own special way
When you in the holding tank and other fiends won’t let you get your way
You never catch a case cause you're slick
Pipe beams projecting, but you’re never caught with shit

[Outro: Soopa Feen, Spoken]
You know why I'm never caught with shit?
Cause I'm Soopa Feen, bitch
I get out real quick, fool
Just like a trapdoor
I don't need your commentary
Quit talking to me you (?) and show me some respect
Nigga, I'm god(?) the third
Hey, I really need something though
I got a PlayStation
A PlayStation nigga
You wanna buy it? 50 bones
PlayStation, nigga
Play-stee
That's yo language, nigga
Play-stee, right?
Motherfucker, buy my shit
I'm Soopa Feen (x2)
You can't hold me back, boy
You can't hold me back
The greatest ever(?)
I'll fault yo ass
You gotta do this man
Young Soopa feen
Really old though, but I'm young, younger, too
I be doin it back in your days
Back, back before you was doin your shit
Motherfucker, don't try to tell me nothing
Del, Delarific, whatever the fuck yo name is
Funky human being
I don't give a fuck about your human being
I'll be peeing on your human being
Nigga, get the fuck out my face
I'm Soopa Feen
Quit talking about me
