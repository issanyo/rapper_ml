Verse 1 (Hopie):
Wait a second, I'm secondary to none
One, every eardrum, you feel it in your tear ducts
Wack rappers set this fire up they set it in Seagram's
Grass bustas get these brass knuckle raps in they knees, son
I'm like some butter pecan, my rhymes smooth, lines tight
You can follow behind what I find too tight
Right on the pinnacle, serial heavy hitter disseminating lyrics
Greeting haters, disintegrate em
I got the weaponry, I'm seasoned to perfection
Reason when you're stressin', flexin' in the wrong direction
Droppin' hot gems in Seratos and Alpine
El Dorado autos, I'm ready for the limelight bottles
Your best chance in your absence
You're so so feelin' Hopie in your torso and more so
Rough like a flask of absinthe down a sore throat
Chokin' while Hopie metaphors coat the air slow

Chorus (Knickerboc):
Three head monster got the fire to burn
Spit the poison, lift the urn[?]
Standin' before me then a'bring it here
And make it very clear

Verse 2 (Del):
Deezle, watch me close the gap
I write a flow to the hole and bolter cap
Where Hopie at?
Comparin' a soul to stats
Till you're balderdash
Bone the craft, the hopeless a**
It'll blow your back
And leave a hole where your shoulders at
Told ya that I'm Mr. Freeze
Colder than a polar cap
Or powerful like a polar bear
Don't compare, au contraire
What you thought was hot was opposite
You not the lick
You talk so fake when you proclamate
You just a break, I'm a monolith, drip
You need an optometrist
'cause you can't see no parts of this
I'm too swift son, you pump my brakes
For you dumbbells
Tryna front on Del, I leave your tongue swelled
Wrapped in gauze like a sarcophagus
Don't even talk to us, you get stomped to dust
You a droid, I see your alloy sparklin'
Triple stage darkness, 'noyed like Lloyd Marcus
Oakland, Deezle dog, I'm not playin'
Hope's my people, fraud, she brought Tasers

Chorus (Knickerboc):
Three head monster got the fire to burn
Spit the poison, lift the urn[?]
Standin' before me then a'bring it here
And make it very clear

Verse 3 (Hopie):
If there was ever a question in my [?]
Say it if it sound right before it's clown time
I think I found a sound bite
Every time I'm asked if I write my own rhymes, stupid a**
And I laugh like, whose shoulders do you think I'm steppin' on?
Hopie spittin' weaponry tested in Armageddon on
Hard I'm on the second verse stallin' until my guns burst
Diamond bullets hit em lungs first and ball hurdle
Ladies, heavy stilettos and amarettos sweeten mics
Sellers, rockin' Zanes by your side if your game's nice
Every rapper notice and focus 'cause Hopie's potent like
Mad [?] maneuverin' raps like bridge [?] (sucka)
It's not a feud it's just a miscommunication
I'm out to reach a hater's outer space affiliation so
If you wasn't impressed with the status quo
Slangin' raw gems to break your fronts, son
Just so you know

Chorus (Knickerboc):
Three head monster got the fire to burn
Spit the poison, lift the urn[?]
Standin' before me then a'bring it here
And make it very clear
