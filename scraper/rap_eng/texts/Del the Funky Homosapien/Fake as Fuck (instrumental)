If you're brown nosin' in the industy (you fake as fuck)
Wanna pretend that you're a friend to me (you fake as fuck)
Funny style record companies (you fake as fuck)
Weak ass MC wannabe's (you fake as fuck)

You know I gotta handle my sponsatility
Along with pillaging of the crusade of the rhythm seas
A million reas
Like ziplock
I seal and freeze
Better than stealin' keys
Or killin' sprees
You ain't worth a hill of beans ratio
To the text I toggle and tilt
Best taste is bottlin' milk
The model of filth
Who's the nastiest?
Who would ever ask me this?
You better aqueous
Before you take half a step
Eager like a bachelorette
With a lack of respect
Like a youth packin a tech
The whole attraction is death
Plethoras electra to bisto
Come to my creep show
To logic is lethal
I repo ya flow
Recucitate
Reanimate
So now it's a candidate
Most likely to laminate
In other words who wanna get served?
I'll hand a plate with a heaping helping
You'll be belchin'
No one's tellin'
While you chokin' you're eye's are open
Acupunture a private pokin'
And I ain't jokin'
Why this evenin' I feel like cryin free men
Rhyme and reason mixed with violent feelin's
Anything that I could squeeze in to make you descend
At a rate that's sure to agitate
Like you bought a bag of shake
My mind's a data place
Plus a batter's box
That'll regulate your whiney boos like I'm Donahue
I'm Omney calmly bombing your Brownstone
Till the cow's home
Well endowed poems
Crash through the embassy
Disrupt the assembly
Dislocate your whole fake industry
Horrendously

Okay, let's start
Child birth the rhyme and leave stretch marks
Etch art with text darts
The cardiac arrest arch
The next stop is where I shop at the fresh mart
Sale of ale and all the bomb you want
There's no counterpart
Take my rhyme around the park
And piss on you like a hound to bark
Down to spark blee's and all
Unbelievable
I see through walls
With evil galls
I feed 'em balls
Agent of derangement
Entertainment tainted
Wit insane
It's flagrant
Foul fragile famous cadence
You'll never make it to day break
Save face
You just a grey space
I lay waste
Rated with frangrance rancid
I can't miss it
Enhanced mits allow me to advance quick
With antics you tamper with your trustees
I bust these as rapidly as slush freeze
You must need parental guidance
Your mental's out of alignment
My mind set is the finest
The pen let you jack off too often
While you sleepin' she contaminate your sperm and offspring
I offset any threat to my nature
Face you with eight flares and a saber
Pave ya till I hit paved dirt
While you blaze dirt
I flame the greenest bomb
Fool, I better never see your palm
You peeping tom
I'ma need the force of my whole crew to keep me calm
I sneak a bomb to your mesa
Disgraced ya
Waste ya
Leave a stain the size of Asia
Imperial premier poet
My perch could never be usurped
For mere syllable serfs
Take it for gospel like you hear in in church
