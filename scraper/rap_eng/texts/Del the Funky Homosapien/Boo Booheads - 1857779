Oh man. Bitches, man, bitches! Sick & tired a this shit
You know what I'm sayin'? Want my money, talkin' shit, don't know
How to act, phuckin' tired, man. FPhuck'm I gonna do, man? Have to put
A foot up your ass? Phuckin' tired of it, man. Phuckin' buy you this
Buy you that, Phuck that shit! Kurious ain't havin' it. Know what I'm
Sayin'?
Boo boo head, boo boo head, boo boo head
I want you dead
I want you bled & bleeding
Needing medical assistance, resistance
Ya kiss meant nuthin'
You was bluffin'
Stuffin' my brain with insane thoughts & notions
Most intelligent people freak you
Because they'll know
You'll give ya all
Give up your drawls
Flap ya jaws & lyin'
& have me cryin'
I'll admit it
Someone before musta shitted down your neck
Boo boo head
But can you be dead?
With fled
Instead of the murda
I'll just tell everybody what I heard of
Word up
All a this over boo boo heads
All a this, all a this...
Back in elementary school
You made me drool
I was cool
& rules were never broken
A token
Of our friendship
All my friends flippin' somersaults
The fault was not yours
Of course, they didn't know, yo
Grils was yucky
Clear 'round & get slapped like a puck-y
But you never said 'Phuck me'
That wasn't in the pictua
I couldn't hit ya with ya hair & braids
And the games we played
Were fun
Till one day a friend said
'Boo boo heads turn red, in the face
When you place
Ya hands on her ass
In class, and give a spank
A banka full of fun
At recess, and be fresh.'
OK, I'll try it
And die if she does
But she did
And turned around and socked me like Rocky
I feel like a heel for real
But now I'm older
And told ya to keel over
Cause now it's different
No innocence
And women sprints the way
You sway to the forces of evil
And we will bust that ass fast and quickly
I dig G's
Disrespectin' rep
Now it's when they shit's come bobbin' brothers
Try and rob another
And I'll rub ya the wrong way
Let the song play
Ooh, I wanna smack you
Mack you & attack you
Even if you black you get no slack
Sue
Call a lawyer
Boy, ya never knew
Ya crew is on a mission
Every weekend
Freakin' & kissin'
With other van ya man
Lets turn the sands in the hourglass
And your power lasts less & guess
& take a gander
I slander ya name & spread propaganda
And I demand ya ta stop
Hop on a train before pain'll
Be ya middle name
In the game of love & happiness
Yes, I caressed ya flesh
But if you test
Ya caught out there without a vest
Mess around and you can rest
I found a new boo boo
Baby, maybe I can crave the
One that saves thee
Reputation, ya'll lets face it
Ya basin'
Smokin', leavin' niggas broken
& open
But I scope in to ya brain
Gain & remain & clues ya use for protection
Now who's next in...
