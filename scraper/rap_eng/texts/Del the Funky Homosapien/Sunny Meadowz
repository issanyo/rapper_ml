[Intro]
Yeah, I'm gonna take it light
Yeah, D-E-L in the house
Funky, funky, funky, funky lyrics
Check this out

[Verse 1]
I contemplate a rhythm with a hunch
Swing and give a punch and put a fraud out to lunch
And scrunch up your rap book pages
Eat 'em like it's licorice, snatch your gold chains
Steal your gold fronts and return 'em to the caves of the motherland
And ride a rhinoceros back to the other land
So I can show a foe who is the prototype
And then go toe to toe and if the rhythm is hype
I take it on my journeys to the mystic place
So I can dis the facial value of your ballyhoo
See, my style is rather passive but I can get aggressive
Brothers get done when they try to be impressive
Cause I do not impress easily, D-E-L is eager to be
The founder of the fragrance and watch the vagrants
Scatter like rats in the sewer as we do 'em like two secret agents

[Verse 2]
In the region of the forest where the march hare dwells
I sit and write scriptures by the old wishing well
Collect all my notes and sail a boat back to Berkeley
Tribes feel my vibe cause my style is rather earthly
Some say it's whack but I ain't trying to hear it
As long as what I do contains my soul and my spirit
It's cool, I use this as a rule of thumb
I take a dip into the pool of radiance until the fool was done
Slidin' on the floor like a fat ignoramus
Ya sold 8 million but ya still don't entertain us
Cause you're fraudulent, I have no time for a jester
Go take your place beside Uncle Fester
Cause you are an uncle too, you are an Uncle Tom
And D-E-L and Hieroglyphics gonna drop the bomb

[Hook]
Yeah...under the sun, under the sun, under the sun
We gonna take it light
Yeah...under the sun, under the sun, under the sun
We gonna take it light
Yeah...under the sun, under the sun, under the sun
Yeah

[Verse 3]
D-E-L, the 18 year old dwella of the meadow
It sure in the hell beats living in the ghetto
Things are peaceful and everything's settle
With a good night's snooze on a bed of rose petals
I wake up in the morning feeling happy and refreshed
Before I make my journeys I must eat and get dressed
A pair of blue jeans and a shirt with greenish hues
Greener than the grass that was caught between my shoes
When I trample through the forest with my brother CM-PX
The kinky haired nubian there with a human
My hair gets notty without the proper grooming
The whole metamorphosis resembles flowers blooming
In the shadows, deep within the trenches of the sea
Free as Leah, a head of hair like a tree
Cause I'm a love child, follow me now children
Cause I'm a love child, I love to see the children smile at my antics
Foes get frantic and nervous and panic
Even as I venture past the planet called Earth
Born from the womb of the nebula
Deeper in the meadow where my actions are irregula'
I bug out and tell my maid to take the rug out
And dust it, and proceed to throw the thugs out of the pasture
As I recline on a hippo
Write the funky speech and watch my profits seem to triple and quadruple
Teaching all the pupils proper scruples in the meadow

[Hook]
Yeah...under the sun, under the sun, under the sun
We gonna take it light
Yeah...under the sun, under the sun, under the sun
We gonna take it light
Yeah...under the sun, under the sun, under the sun
We gonna take it light
Yeah...under the sun, under the sun, under the sun
Yeah

[Outro]
How ya doin'?
How ya livin'?, in the meadow, in the meadow
How ya livin'?
How ya feelin'?
How ya doin'?
Hey...ah yeah
