[Ossie Davis]
You should be somewhere where
The listening devices are tuned up very high

[Verse 1: Tame One]
Hieroglyphics, Parallel Thought, Boom Skwad specifics
Yeah, Fuck what you commit to memory
I could wing it and bring it doper
I'm supposed to, I'm off the hook, banger, hanger, and holster
With the sick shit
I'll show you the ropes like Slick Rick when I spit shit
Let the boss set it up in the dojo, cross legged
On some different shit, meditating with incense lit
Self-medicating 'til Tame One's dumb numb
Up in this bitch, off syzrup, pancakes and prescripts
A self-admitted statistic, ghetto from the get-go
That got shit to get ya
The Lil Wayne of the game, I'll kill ya
Y'all seem soft, I'll sawed-off shotgun your head clean off
Sharp as the teeth of a shark, [?], speaking in barks
My most recent decent remarks [?]
You just a afterthought
I'm right here right now, I'm the thing to do
But then again, on a scale from 1 to 10, you's a 2
Who's the next to contest? rhyme fresh [?]
Evidently, not willing to be building like me
Tame One's a kidder, more than likely
Look like Spike Lee (hahahahaha)

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
[?] drip from the lyrical elixir I mix up like a blender
Serve it over ice for legal tender
Word bender, droppin' turds and shittin'
On a personal vendetta, verses fill your vile up with venom
Ten car pile up when I hit 'em
Demolition derby style, eating rappers Kirby style for dinner
Pin 'em to the map, figure four, ligaments torn
Niggas be boring and their shit will sit in the store
Look at my rhyme on a scroll, see it as literature
I ain't bitter or sore about situations, it's nathan
My mind be on another wave length
From the pavement to the basement
To your tape deck, now your iPod is the encasement
That contains the things, gimme some of your bank
For a fair exchange I say thanks with appreciation
You get to peep how I freak the phrases
For the people's amazement
Me and Tame is a rare breed
Bringing styles out the treasury but weary of these
Who are like a preview, but we see you
You gonna have to leap through some flamin' hoops
Before you claim our juice
Then if you make it through, Imma bank on you
So hard it'll make your face droop, wait fool
Take two we gon' have to make you peep game
Nothin' too deep that need to be explained
Just slap you hard enough to make your brain switch lanes
Look out (errrrrrrrrr)
