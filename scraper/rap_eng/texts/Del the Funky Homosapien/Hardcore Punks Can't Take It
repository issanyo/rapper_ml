Yeah man, half these motherfuckas, man, is wack, man
Half these, as a matter of fact, like, like, like
3/4 of y'all motherfuckas is wack, that's real
Ain't saying shit, I don't even give a fuck, man
Shit's hardcore, man, punks can't take it

Y'all, I keep it hardcore and punks can't take it
I got that shit passed down to me by foul situations
Dealin', give a fuck how you clowns be feelin'
I can't sleep sound without thousands peelin'

Like potatoes
How my day goes
Straight to work, innovate flows, renovate tones
Penetrate domes when they ain't knowin'

Illiteracy, all time high
It's bigger than me, I just wade through the hate juice
It ain't cool but shit that's what'll make you
Come through with a breakthrough

The adversity, work it with the need to express
Dump off the excess and zone inside my headset
And give way game like midway engraved in the caverns
Where the funk is imagined and conjured

Creating a monster
It won't be long till the drama spill
I got a stronger will
Go beyond the field because I wanna

Honor, shield my personal armor
From my mentality that you piranhas long to conquer
But this time we gonna have some fish fry
Twist time so it benefit mine

Yeah, in the nick of time
Nickel slick rhymes
Shift sides to the flip side
Soak a motherfucka, let 'em drip dry

Can't take it
I can't even believe this shit, you motherfuckas
You know how it feels
Some, some, some

Sometimes I feel the place is disgraceful
And no reason in particular
Pictures of the past life I was stuck in
Inducted in the ruckus, a lot of destructive motherfuckas

Some was G's for real and some was busters
Some were corrupted and couldn't be trusted
I wasn't above it, I wasn't a thug but a knuckle-head buggin'
And fuckin' shit up for nothin'

Hip Hop appeared like a storybook fantasy
A lot of fools capped on me
When I rapped for free in front of the whole faculty
After recess, jealous dummies wanted to scrap with me

I caught a few blows, I fucked some fools up
Now they comin' to school with they tools tucked
You know they pride, can never leave it at a few cuts
And bruises signifying that they was losers

I'm like, please tell me who was the winner then?
Chasin' me with knives with they bigger friends
And family members and none of them fools was badly injured
I remember

I laid low 'til could stray from home
I had to stay in the safe zone
Told myself, I'm gonna make it with these great flows
I make, those bozo's chose they fate, I used to know

Those who would hold the weight
I never turned up my nose
But always wanted to know they were straight
Closed casket, no joke, so is the wake
And half of them know they fake, tryna show some strength

It use to feel like there's no escape
I was broke, no dates, all the hoes would fake
All the bro's on the block tell me that the flow was dope
So there's hope, just hold that rope and don't let go

'Cause some of them lost they grip
Habitual liars always tryna start some shit
Hell, don't be a target, be smart and swift
Mind my business but remember you was a part of this

I never forgot and put it in the bars I spit
So all you crabs in the bucket, get off my dick
'Fore your ass get served in a match of words
Hardcore just like your ass deserve

Your ass deserve

Can you take it?
Can you take it?
