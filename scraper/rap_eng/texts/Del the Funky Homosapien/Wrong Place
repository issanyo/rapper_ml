[Verse 1]
I writes rhymes for rehearsal
But first, chill, I gotta little story to tell ya
How I almost caught a... bad one
Add one to the list of 2,001 stupid things to do
I had crew when they stepped at a party
Hardly even known I own a Smith & Wesson but it's restin' at home
In a shoe box, they see crews jock
So they wanna step and take the rep I got
I said, "Wait a second", check inside my coat for a shank
They must be imaginin' that I'm money in the bank
They'll get spanked
'Cause I'm not the nigga
I got bigger brothers waiting in the bushes to mush kids
I talk when I wanna talk, never silence
Violence erupts when I clown ya, catch a beat down ya
'Cause I never back away from niggas
Even if you gotta pistol, I dare ya pull the trigger
But that's suicide, either you must die or I must so why bust me
'Cause I'm guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time
Comin' at ya in the wrong state of mind
I'm, out in a hurry, a pow and a flurry
Of bullets come speedin' by, I needn't die
I gotta make tracks and take back my words
I eat 'em 'cause everybody knows I didn't beat 'em...

[Hook]
Being in the wrong place at the wrong time
(At the wrong time)
Being in the wrong place at the wrong time
Being in the wrong place at the wrong time
Being in the wrong place at the wrong time

[Verse 2]
When I'm out on the town, I don't frown
At people cause they tend to get offended
And then the heat will
Be on my ass I got class
Never out of line, 'cause
I'm standing here without a nine
Pistols I wish will not blast me
Task be, circlin' corners lookin' for Warners
You know, the Brothers, me and you
We didn't do shit but we get hassled because we crew
And we rollin'
This is my car, it isn't stolen
I hope you catch a slug, straight in your colon
When ya walkin' the beat
I bet ya gotta sheet hangin' up in ya closet
Fuck this law shit
But there's two laws to follow, you know
There is the laws of the city and the laws of the ghetto
I go to clubs with a smile on my face
Just in case niggas look and wanna whyle in the place
'Cause of jealousy, well, it's me, only me
Niggas walkin' in poppin' shit, that's who the phonies be
Peep it one night and you'll see it it's quite clear
Since we all know now that's why we're
Never in the wrong place at the wrong time!

[Hook]
(At the wrong time)
Being in the wrong place at the wrong time
Being in the wrong place at the wrong time
Being in the wrong place at the wrong time

[Verse 3]
Damn, I hate cops!
I need to bust they chops
Always gettin' props for the niggas they pop
Peep, I smoke weed get weeded
'Cause I need it to calm my nerves before a pig get bleeded
I got busted for less than a gram of hash
They wanna cram my ass in the slammer
Punk po-po
Bringin' back hash from Amsterdam is a no-no
I didn't know they would catch me
Punk mutt fetch me
Stretched me out at Customs, gotta bust 'em
I can't call it
They found it in my wallet
Now Customs got me and I just can't stall it
I wish they would leave me alone
Dog lookin' at me like 'feed me a bone'
He might bite me, very likely
They had to strike me with a fine or time
I said “Fine!”
Mines was 500 bones
For a gram of hash, my mind was blown
Come back to Michigan, so we can bitch again
Federal offense, now I better go and convince the judge...
