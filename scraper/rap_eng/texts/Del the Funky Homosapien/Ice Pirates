[Intro: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Del, Sunspot
The ice pirates
The ice pirates
Ice pirates, ice pirates

[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Yo check it out
Kamikaze, cut a clear path
With a mere grass, it's like tear gas
Flames will see your ass
Pass the beer glass
The frosty mug, plus off these drugs
Get colossal love from hostile thugs
Drop one lug crack your dome piece
I hone speech, sharper than sabres
Rhyme raiders, learn your time tables
Intertwine cables and transmit
The transcripts I brandish
Eat y'all I'm famished
Expand with cannabis
Pull a tooth and a tusk
Sunspot will let the cannon bust and crush frontal
Too comfortable when I'm amongst the flow
That will stunt your growth
Puncture skulls with harpoons
Who are you? Cartoons
Animated pantomime
In the sands of time I plant landmines
When I highjack, you climax, so why ask?
Don't reply back, I'm human Imac
You get side tracked, your rap will bellyflop
While we get hella props, propel like hellacopt's
It's Teren and Corey, carrying 40's
No time for sore feet
Luckier than four-leaf
Hit points, capacity, toggle tenacity
Your brainwaves travel at half the speed after weed
Fax machine freeze, cleave ya, photocopy ya
Phony ass philosophers all the sudden at a loss for words
Remodel your Sleepy Hollow
Leave you completely boggled
Make you hobble on one leg through potholes
You not close, getting colder
I'm shitting bolders
I spit like Yoda
Bitch I told ya, we hold up the planet
Leave you tore up and damaged
Fold up and sandwich your manuscripts with magical amulets
Can you get down to business?
Handle any challenges?

[Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien]
It's all coming back to me
How we used to rap for free
Fools wasn't platinum bound
We rocked the happening sounds
It's all coming back to me
How we used to rap for free
Fools wasn't platinum bound
We rocked the happening sounds

[Verse 2: Sunspot Jonz]
Like minions on the white and blacks
We attack, ransack, wack, out of place, smoked out MC's
Macked out wannabe's
They all play freeze tag in degrees of pseudo identities
It's all anomalies at war with masculinity
They can never touch, the legendary
Legend varies from state to state, tape to tape
Tape to grade, live shows with live flow
Turning to negative, suicidal, never right though
Perpetrating survival, in a tidal wave
Your vital signs kill the rival [?]
Claiming you're Ovaltine
Well man, your talent is mine
Like Frasier/Ali dreams stand
As a nick you with my spurs
Shwing, get cut like Ramen from the [?]
While me and Del stand as microphone kings
Sunspot stings like the Police
And these word that I sing [?]
You're stage show
Yo you don't want no mo, no dough, no show, no flow
And you lied, oh, no coal, rapper [?]
Lead to liquidation, occupation, gravitation, to the nose
I suppose back in the day it was about free shows
But today everybody knows that (bows)
Hiero, Living Legends, fly flows, as high as high goes
We flow as we go, we go as we go
Ice pirates

[Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien]
It's all coming back to me
How we used to rap for free
Fools wasn't platinum bound
We rocked the happening sounds
It's all coming back to me
How we used to rap for free
Fools wasn't platinum bound
We rocked the happening sounds
It's all coming back to me
How we used to rap for free

[Outro: Del the Funky Homosapien, (Sunspot Jonz)]
Yeah, just keep it up, keep going strong
Keep your mind on the right path and you can do it man
You can do it
Yeah, yeah
(Living without getting paid, I know)
(Oh no, oh no)
