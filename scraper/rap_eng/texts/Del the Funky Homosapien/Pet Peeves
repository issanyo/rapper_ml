You better, watch how close they get

We all know FWA's, how they lay
Cause they figure if you're bumpin the pays
In the long run, and it's all fun in their eyes
They must be on one how, they prepare lies
Get up close make you think, you the host of the ceremonies
Why you ain't peepin like a doggy mark his territory
They're never there for me when I need a little boost
Because of who you are, they can get a little juice
Then they like to seemingly leans up on your shoulders
Otherwise he's steppin on toes gettin over
Flappin his molars talkin 'bout he owe you
And every time he smoke, he don't show you no love
And be the first fool with his lips on the blunt
If he persists to front I'ma commenced to dump
Be careful when you make a little something that's yours
Cause a lot of these predators want yours to be theirs
Or at least own a share just by bein there
I be on some hermit skit, and fools think I'm square now
There's an interesting way to look at it
I look at them as bein fake, the way they took advantage
Speaking on the crooks of the planet, who claim they got game
Yeah you the game and they the hunter; just one more

Hey whassup man, this is D-E-L once again
I'm here to tell you a little story about this motherfucker
Who keep runnin his big ass mouth
You don't know me, motherfucker
Shut your ass up, 'fore I slap the lips off your motherfuckin face
Man, you got a big ass mouth!
You know what?

[Del]
Fools is hella talkative, saying how I walk and live
Always trying to start the kid, wishin that we all can give
A small interview, just a subterfuge
Wanna hook up with you so they can say 'whatchu do'
Get your own life, live your own legacy
Why you wanna spread my rees, talking 'bout my girls pregnancy
Professor, I guess you never learned your lesson
When you saw me out drinkin at the bar
You said I was sexin this other ho
Chuck D, what a brother know
About my beeswax, runnin off with your feedback
Who I smoked weed with? Who I smoked crack with? (false)
How I sexed every girl you know without no prophylactic
Fool, I'll be in the house and that's it
On the rap tip or studyin, unlike you
You quite new, no game
I understand you a youngster, wanna be hustler
Undercover buster
Can't believe I trusted ya - but that goes to show
How fools fold getting jelly off the dough, yo!

[Del's imitation]
"Del's rich Del's bitch got zero, cause Del's a hero
Del's a weirdo because he do heroin"

[Del]
Ain't got no idea where Teren's been
I should take it to pugilism so
I can fuse your vision with some realness
Instead of these fake phony stories you be glorifyin
Don't you know that many more are dyin?
From the fatal disease, called runnin them choppers
In front of females, or on front of the coppers
You only do this shit cause you be wanting your propers
Somebody's gonna get steamed and run up and pop ya
You exercise your choppers really, choo choo choo
You exercise your choppers off some brand new news
Your molars bite, your canines tear, whether it's false or true
You exercise your choppers like some gossipin fool
You know what?
You get your little notices from bumpin your gums
When you should be concentratin on lumpin your sums
Got to show your little ass when company comes
Cause We From The Crew That You Wanna Be From
You get your little notices from bumpin your gums
When you should be concentratin on lumpin your sums
Got to show your little ass when company comes
Cause We From The Crew That You Wanna Be From!
BIOTCH!

[Chorus]
Followers, dick swallowers
No power over themselves, blindness
Don't take it as a diss, take it as an act of kindness
We wanna be in front while you fools is behind us
Are you gonna live your whole life with blindness on your eyelids?
Pretty boys fakin like they grinders

[Del]
First off, you a buster so mind us
On the street with your crack thinkin your a timer
Co-signin, findin it ain't workin
Fiends is perkin, I seen you on Perkins
Fools chirpin around the blocks with Glocks
And you, really ain't ready for the plot they got
It's unbelievable the way the leave your skull on the pavement
Snatch up your scrilla as soon as you made it
You could be layin dead, instead you play dead
So they would quit whoopin your ass; you get, put in the past
Tryin to keep up with the Jones' like the mass
N.C. baby, means you got no class

[Poser speaks]
"Aw what nigga? Man, I be on the flat lands all the time, nigga
I-I ain't even trippin!"
[DEL]
"Man you from the hills though man, what you doin"
[Poser]
"Aww nigga you don't know nigga. Nigga, I'm following niggas."
[DEL]
"You trippin' man."
[Poser]
"Man I be grindin' and chillin'
Nigga, I was rolling dice the other day nigga."
[DEL]
"You need to take your ass to school."
[Poser]
"Aww"

[Chorus]
Followers, dick swallowers
No power over themselves, blindness
Don't take it as a diss, take it as an act of kindness
We wanna be in front while you fools is behind us
Are you gonna live your whole life with blindness on your eyelids?
Pretty boys fakin like they grinders
("Dude, that ain't me, dude")

[Del]
You bite somebody's style, it's invitin like a child
You cling to it; I hear it, hmmm
It's got a ring to it - if that's your thing do it
At least you claim you ain't down with that hiphop shoobeedoobee
Which is fine cause my click say you booty
You a white kid, your mom said I'm a mooley
Now you talking 'bout pass the doobie and the toolie
Got your raps and your gat pointed at yours truly
Talking 'bout you gonna school me, who me?
Here's a little jewel like a ruby
Since you talkin like you knew me
Playing a role that's straight out a movie
Acting unruly, and your neighbors call SOO-WEEE
To the pigs then they fling you in the brig
Leave gang bangin to the real gat holders
Or real black soldiers who you don't know of
Who don't show love with all you sun and your thun
Cause they know where you from
You from Oakland, you rich and you ain't from the slums
Your pops is a politician
So why bein a criminal is your three wishes
Used up, do what comes naturally
Quit playing a role that don't even have to be
You slippin

[Poser 2]
"Dude, I ain't slippin, man I'm from the town too
Man I'm from the Oakland hills dude
That's East Oakland, blood. You don't even know, man."
[DEL]
"Man, you trippin man."
[Poser 2]
"I ain't trippin dude
Why you trying to step to me like, you know, you somethin man?"
[DEL]
"Yap, yap, yap, yap."
[Poser 2]
"What up? Whatever dude, whatever."
[DEL]
"All in my ear with that yappin, man. You trippin."
[Poser 2]
"I'll keep at it to! Wassup?"
[DEL]
"What!? [laughing] You gonna get hard?
What you talkin about fool?"
[Poser 2]
"Hey, you never know."

[Chorus 2]
Followers, dick swallowers
No power over themselves, blindness
Don't take it as a diss, take it as an act of kindness
We wanna be in front while you fools is behind us
Are you gonna live your whole life with blindness on your eyelids?
