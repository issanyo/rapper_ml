[Chorus]
This is real hip hop, not no phoney phranchise
Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide
This is D E L, not no phoney phranchise
Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide
This is Hieroglyphics, not no phoney phranchise
Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide

[Verse 1]
Rag Del, impetuous, tempestuous
My power's activated, have to make it, funky
Del deep, scuba diver wet suit who survived to get loose
Brewin' in the test tubes
To the rescue, extradition process
To get you all stressed, step onto my office
That's what you call fresh, it's more like some soft breasts
If I stopped cess, I probably would cough less
Test it, just to see if ya'll rested
I'm blessin' the beat just like if I was the best man
Yo, you miss it in ya' public school district
Get a book and do the physics, yo' I got a cool image
Like Hendrix, my kindred, y'all fuck up to my index
Bench press rappers doing sets with my Syntax
Ain't nothin' new motherfucker, man I been black
Impact, remember Malcolm X wore a pimp hat
You paper chasin' when you make it then you spit that
That your whole life shoulda never even been rap
Wannabe gangster fool around and get your friend capped
Talkin' hella shit my brother trying to buy a ten sack
Man, just call me amphibious
Submerging so deep yanking curtains on these idiots
Walking 'round oblivious more than annoying
Everywhere I turn a black life is destroyed
And times getting tough gotta sign for unemployment
Walkin' round the town all 'noid and bent
Out of posture from sixteen blunts, a pint of vodka
Intoxicated some of y'all call it faded
With my headphones slammin' playin Iron Maiden
Sleepin' in the lobby in the Days Inn

[Chorus]
It's just that real hip hop, not no phoney phranchise
Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide
This is D E L, not no phoney phranchise
Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide
This is Hieroglyphics, not no phoney phranchise
Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide

[Verse 2]
Never outdated
When my power's activated, have to make it, funky
I'm barnstorming, alluring, curing your ailments with lyrical talismans
Here it is, for the scrutiny of every record reviewer
Your tool to reduce your little rhymes are nonexistent
Meticulous methods I use to modify, the style you all should try
Posh poetics, cost effective, neck and neck with sun beams
Transcends the fabric of time, yeah, it's one thing
Named Hiero, habitual funk, fiends and freakers
Techniques from the major leaguers leaves you meager
Style malfunctional, I'm punchin' in early
Right on schedule gold medalist rebellious (Who?)
Del is, got you cornered like a cougar
Comin' up with new words like you must be a lummox
Wanna infiltrate my crew when you know you'll go nuts
Lactose intolerant your bowels'll blow up
Catastrophic so deep can't locate with metal detectors
Listen more than once, you'll need several inspections
I'm sicker than a beef recall
Reiterate the fact with flows that free-fall
Reintroduction the classic material, that last with imperial
Props and Pop Will Eat Itself
Hotter than coals, tread and your feet'll melt
Like plastic I castrate contenders
With a crew that got more power than the West Coast Avengers
Sit and let your ears swim in the splendor

[Chorus]
It's just that real hip hop, not no phoney phranchise
Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide
This is D E L, not no phoney phranchise
Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide
This is Hieroglyphics, not no phoney phranchise
Winnin' by a landslide and you know you can't hide
