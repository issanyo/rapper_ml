I think it’s time to get the zap board
The rap lord has disembarked to restore the missing parts
For all ya’ll, stiffer than starch
You know the pictorial symbol
Portable nimble brain waves got my grimy chains jiggling
I’m burning at Higher Learning like Singleton
Single out simpletons with stylings such as Intercon
It’s the bomb let’s get it on
Mr. Bombay to you
Slay a crew You never paid your dues
You’re testimony phony bologna
And boney with only a wooden leg to stand on
Like a pregnant panda in the wilderness and I’m the wildebeest
And I see you still a thief with my style in the grill of your teeth
Diligently apealing with speech with militant beats
In and of leaks to let my feet miss the freeze
Mysterious blistering like the gold on Mr T Handicap your voyeurism destroy your vision
Massive with gashes no defended forms step in the swarm of bees leave with hives
Rhymes conceive with knives of flesh
While you're wild as exile
My text styles spookier than x-files
You fruity like a pedophile
After the battle cries thats when I metabolize
While you fantasize I antagonize like replacement killers ease your filler
Ridiculous, meticulous
Fry you like a chicken breast
Fuck your smith n wesson
Pull you out of the oven get the dressing
With possession
Question all directions
While you still a suck petulance
Stuck dwelling in the past

[Hook](x2)

Pull over, get out of the car (You’re under arrest)
Slowly put your hands behind your head legs crossed(You’re under arrest)

I do it till I feel fine
Real rhyme, still time
Stop frame, drop change
Rock brain, stock exchange
Mock my name
There’s not a lot to gain from that
When I’m up to bat its like you trying to duck a gat
You commonplace
I shift time and space
Leave your mind erased like the year 2000 and data replaces the faces
Cause there is no oasis
I wield your locations
A military pack of black tornadoes
I Fernando Slam you on an anvil
Scrape you with a breakthrough
Lacerate your plastic face acquired though plastic surgery
I leave your flow burgundy and crimson limbs and arteries
Down in the chart MC’s
As I’m sipping margaritas its a part of the feature from the particle preacher
Universal ubiquity when you sit with me and chat
You will get to see a fat flow that fried your brain cells like formaldehyde or alkaline
Check the words now combined
Leave you with powder burns
Deltron Z has now returned
My dogmatic songs average rap artists
I’m an author who augments my solstice to the tip with my groove essentials
I’m coming in a hydrofoil spreading hydroponics
While you chasing the dragon
Like you're facing a magnet
My brain is digital playing with analog controllers
Force movement in increments with instruments

[Hook](2x)
