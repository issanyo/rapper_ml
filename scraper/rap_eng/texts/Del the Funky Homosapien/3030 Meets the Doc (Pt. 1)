[Intro: Dr. Octagon + Del The Funky Homosapien]
Welcome to my laboratory, Deltron
I am pleased to meet your acquaintance—I know you're unmatched within your field—
Octa-god
—You're much more informed than Trapper John, M.D, your scientific discoveries are legend—could you enlighten me?

[Verse 1: Dr Octagon]
I'm rap-ital, capital, just a moving, rapping animal
Punch straight like Zorro
How you want it—oral?
Watch me like porno, coming through the tube, innovative with my pubic hair braided
Tip-top shape, I'll make ER's doctors put on brakes
Friday the 13th, they bring my underwear from Crystal Lake
They want a Frito-Lay
But [?]
My rhythm is sharp like a switchblade
Who' bitch made creamy, yellow, athletic, like the Oakland A's
Lord, I own the rings
Nine inches with ginseng, I'm not wasting time pretending
I'm doing steak right now, I'm serving you onion rings
Swing up, upscale watch me lift those barbells
Watch the pro throw four thousand pounds of fanmail
Step up if you' using fishscale, mini-goldfish
I'm a big whale—flip up!

[Chorus: Dr. Octagon + Del The Funky Homosapien]
Octagon, Deltron
(Welcome those well on their way to being martyrs)
Time to see the doctor
Octagon, Deltron
(DEFCON 5—defense level rise, your eyes focus harder)
Octagon, Deltron
(Welcome those well on their way to being martyrs)
Time to see the doctor
Octagon, Deltron
(DEFCON 5—defense level rise, your eyes focus harder)

[Verse 2: Del The Funky Homosapien]
Okay—I remove the robot to reprogram the plot against the onslaught
One wrong walk will leave you roadblocked
Homing from the dock, refers to how the flight
Get' path-locked by the magical mockery when you cockblock
I am you not, gotcha', talk to the hand
Backslapping yo' ass, crackin' yo' mask
I'll be happy to add my perverted inversion of language
With words during my display of pop-subversion
Undermine the system, distance myself from galaxies
Hell-bent on tragically typically mimicking fallacies
I was bespent, misrepresenting they' self
Down to the cell, microscopes couldn't have found the realm
Drown yourself, attempting to bad-mouth
You mad-foul, act like I knock smooth trash out
Don't act stupid 'cause I can prove that now
Act now while supplies last, as I black out

[Chorus: Dr. Octagon + Del The Funky Homosapien]
Octagon, Deltron
(Welcome those well on their way to being martyrs)
Time to see the doctor
Octagon, Deltron
(DEFCON 5—defense level rise, your eyes focus harder)
Octagon, Deltron
(Welcome those well on their way to being martyrs)
Time to see the doctor
Octagon, Deltron
(DEFCON 5—defense level rise, your eyes focus harder)

[Verse 3: Dr. Octagon + Del The Funky Homosapien]
American disaster, fix the wall with plaster
Digitally I'm mastered, you can come in backwards
At work or playground, you see me at the synagogue
No time for blogs—Kennedy, call Leon!
Eradicate the spectrum, erecting the monument
Movin' the conglomerate, mood very ominous
Tomahawk hits—to the frontal lobe—who want it, though?
Fronting won't help you feel comfortable, humble yourself
You don't know Del, location on the under-stow
The dumbest of foes be excluded from comin' close
All the rest want to test, but I'm raw as flesh wounds
The doctor can address you—perhaps you could be rescued

[Chorus: Dr. Octagon + Del The Funky Homosapien]
Octagon, Deltron
(Welcome those well on their way to being martyrs)
Time to see the doctor
Octagon, Deltron
(DEFCON 5—defense level rise, your eyes focus harder)
Octagon, Deltron
(Welcome those well on their way to being martyrs)
Time to see the doctor
Octagon, Deltron
(DEFCON 5—defense level rise, your eyes focus harder)
