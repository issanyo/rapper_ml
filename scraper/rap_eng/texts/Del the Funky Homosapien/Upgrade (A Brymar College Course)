So upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

Comin' from the outer regions of the universe
Deltron Zero and Automator
Check it

[Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Hey time for you to upgrade, fuck save, time to load
All my rhymes the soul, and find your own
Salivate over what I collaborate,with high tech wizardry
And breathe new life into the industry
Save to the hard drive, for the archives
Three thousand thirty, with a global apartheid
Sensitivity ain't the energy, brain chemically contorted
With no coordinates, to your ordinance

[Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Yo, your recovery's slow
My dual input, plus my modem, the tools in foot
Long songs instrumental digital projector professor
I'll school you on the art and how it's texture mapped
Get your act together, my style is mega
Educate the heads of eight lonely beggars
Only shred of evidence is the virtual file
Stored within the cerebellum hit you Berkowitz style

[Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

[Verse 3: Del the Funky Homosapien]
My defense capabilities, with ape agility
Take possibilities to the point of sense and shatter it
Commence the babbling, I'm meditatin' on a homosapien
With no education I'm 3D acceleration
My programmin' language, is the strangest
To come to grips, with mechanized mischief
Kicks it off with circular projectiles, X-Files
Heralded, as the most important dwarf the corporates

[Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

[Verse 4: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Hey, I reduce the game, when I boost my brain
What you used to sayin', I loosen the frame
With shock announcements, t-minus and countin'
Effects control and bouncin', star studded and flooded
Like fountains, a new machine
Real artists are few between, you better lube your screen
My renders are splendor, three-sixty
Reflecting quickly, increase your disk speed
So you can

[Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

[Verse 5: Del the Funky Homosapien]
My production model is the stuff to boggle minds
You got a log-on time of exactly thirty-six nanoseconds
Amb-i-dex-tri-ous with ambience
Watch the cannons twist while I lockout my hardware
Word warfare logistically locate and process
With psychotropics to optimize my profits
Envelop you with development kits that help me
To embellish the elements dynamic and too intelligent

[Hook: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter

[Verse 6: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Lookie here
As soon as I release the chip, you cease to rip
Synopsis, you want to top this? Reach to it
Digital retouch, reconstruct a whole conglomerate
With our armaments we use with tolerance
Such as a G-Bomb, cyborg with 3 arms
Translate the ancient language with a brain dish
Micro machines polystrene conducting electrons
Deltron strengthen with molecular bonds

[Outro]
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter
Upgrade your grey matter, cause one day it may matter
Uuhaaaa...uh
