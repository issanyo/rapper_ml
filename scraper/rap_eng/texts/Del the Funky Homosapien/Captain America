Album: Hiero Oldies Vol. 1
Song: Captain America

The Falcon: "I don't know who that cat is, or why he's got a hate on for
Cap'; But I sure aim to
Find out!"

Villain: "So bird man! You sneak up from behind; Precisely the sort of
Tactics I should have
Expected from you."

The Falcon: "Save the conversation, for I am not behind you now, clay
Face!"

Villain: "Out of my way fool! This is good enough for you! And for
You..."

Del

Flexin' the futuristic style
That will devistate minds
As I find more elaborate metaphors
So meditate
Think for a second as I becken
Abstract thoughts brought to the surface
Watch as I burst this
Rhyme flow
I design slow moving tempos so the simple minded foes find my flows
Moving at the speed of light
I need a tight
Sample so I can dismantle your cranium
Play me dumb if you want imbecile
I can pick your brain
Like a grain of sand
In an hour glass when its filled
To capacity Cassidy
Hop-a-long to the song that is strong
I'm the massive bee
With a twelve foot stinger and I wring you're little wet towel
Cause I'm getting foul when I'm meddled with
I settle this
Violence I silence
MC's who continue
When you know you will fail
Slow snail as I salt ya
Then watch ya shrivel up and sizzle cause I'm hard like Gilbralta
You're butter-soft so you can park it out ya little chauffeur
Cause I go for the esaphogus when I choke ya
Broke ya skeletin ya fail again
And I'm the victa
You can pick the time and the place
So you can get a taste of medecin for your medulla cause I school a
Ferris Beulla cuttin class cause your style is butt 'n' ass;
I pass one to A+
And I say hush child
Cause your plush style
Is unstable as a slush pile
You ain't down with the program
You snow man
Me the Homosapien is funky like your toe jam
So damn enlightenin I'm frightenin allota men
Open up your shutters let the sunshine in

Simple Simon rhymin' on the airwaves
So scare slays to the rhythm
So I give 'em more than a fair trade
Verbal blades
Slice humans
To ribbons cause they're fibbin' so you'll be assumin'
That I'm the dopest
I focus on the vibes that I conjure
Clean up the stains in your brain when I launder
Now feast upon
The thoughts like a mental plum
Maybe you might learn something before I'm done
Spit out the pits and hit the flows in the nose
Del lets your sub-conscious be exposed
Where it like a bullet proof vest upon your chest
Even the best hollow tip bullet couldn't make an impression
Cause this lesson
Is invulnerable
Never dwell on the hellish aspects
Have fun until you perish
Cherish your lifetime
This is why I write rhymes
To illuminate the ones with the tight minds
Sign on the dotted line
Spottin fine shelter
Step to me wrong and I'mma belt ya
Eye for an Eye
But you're eye shouldn't cry over spilled milk
Feel guilt when you know you're wrong
Never sing the song like you know it better than anyone else's
Cause that's selfish
Learn to admit mistakes
Just sit and takes a load off your back
Don't this acoustic bass on this track
Pack a wallop
All up in your face cause I'm the bold kid
Check out the illogical styles that I molded
Silly-putty syllables
That still will pull uplifting
The masses the higher plateaus of hip-hop listening

Villain: "My red, white and blue foe- I have no desire to kill you, not
Now, not when I can make
You suffer all the more by slaying the one you call the Falcon."

Captain America: "No way to reach him in time."

Villain: "So watch, my friend. Watch and greive. Eh? My weapon's charge
. . Exhausted??!"
