[Verse 1: Tajai]
It's the linchpin
Lynchin'
Antsy inchin' bit by bit chompin' at the bit
My shots hit
Accurate for profit
Passionate for profit
Cashin' in, that's the shit
Lyrical laxative
Runnin' off afta'
Never relaxing, unlatched
Different than the last one
So let's see..
Chocolate dipped nuts, I'm Nestl√© milk
World Wrestling Federation built
Y'all are complacent still?
Display some skill!
My word placement first place
If not I verse basic
My complex...is complex
Balance in check
No comment with comparable talents as yet
There's always a first
Yet, there's always a verse
And always it hurts, so they always disperse
Tails tucked..
Who, why, when, where, what?
And how...sorry but not with that style!
I'm fond of fondling these tactless tactile
Cats until they tapped out
Put that down...cause I put that down
Yeah I do that there
Why you act scared?
Talkin' 'bout 'who that there'...I'll knock 'em out!
If you ain't ship shape keep your shit shut
'fore I shift shape, leave this shit shut
Closed up...sucka get your flows up!
You hold down...what's the hold up, huh?

[Hook] [Del]
Uh, somethin' ya do when you're fire resistant
An ion intrinsic instantaneous lenses (?)
Diablo, domino effect wobble, stumble
Tryin' to follow?
Ask Pallo, dumbo!
Need a model?
Taj will assault silicone
Reverberate with realer tone
Fill in holes 'til it hurt deep in your bones
I mean really drill it home to your inner zone

[Verse 2: Pep Love]
We put in the work to make your body jerk
We won't shirk the duty
Of makin' you shake your gluteus maximus
Yeah, that's what's up!
The music is movin', you need to be catchin' up
Classical massacres occurs in a flash, a blur
Smashin' our hammer
Then when we clash with words
Adrenaline rush shatter you fragile gentlemen
When I hit 'em up with agile style
Venom and change the game like two ways did pagers
And 2Pac did before the plagarists came
Sword swing
Around, we not horsing
I'ma do mine, you do your thing
Hieroglyphics is monolithic
Chronicle and I careen in on a collision course to contradiction
God is listenin'
We collage, analyze with the touch of a brush
To paint this picture
I'm heart felt with the texture of velvet
My art propellin' the wax start meltin'
We makin' the matrix break to this
And motivatin' to shake complacentness
Mixed of many maneuvers
We get blitzed and the groove is deep as it get
To reap benefits
From Oakland to Brooklyn
The language spoken broken and crooked
You know how we do it!
