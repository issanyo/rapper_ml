{Ladies and gentlemen, rap fans of all ages
Tonight we have a literal state of pandemonium
As Sir DzL, aka Joe Higashi, makes his way to the ring
As you can see
You can almost taste the electricity in the air, ladies and gentlemen}

{The challenger had better live up to the trash
He was talking at the press conference two nights ago
Or it looks like he'll be leaving the ring fingerless
After Higashi's signature scissor kick
Oh, this is gonna be a good one, rap fans}

I'm back with the tiger kick
Joe Higashi, all team activist of spit swivel grip
Crippling blows within editions of flows
It's a gala of gargantuan proportions

The greatest show in stereo
The weary ol' drag you been hearin' is dead
We playin' funk at the burial grounds and it's a merry ol' sound
And a jolly good time when we body fools with rhymes

Smell the burnin' flesh when the words of death
Bring eternal rest or internal stress
Beef or chicken, either way the meat is sickened
Bacteria, we here in your kitchen

Fools hearin' but they clearly don't listen
Until they sittin' in a twister on they way to Oz
And that's when I'mma holla at y'all
'Cause you gon' need the wizard's expertise
If you expect to leave

Sir Di, the midnight savior spittin' my flavor
Gettin' my paper, neighbor
To catch a tiger, you have to try a little harder
I already commandeered you cargo
Sir D-Z, the blue meanie, few see me
A new species like ET

I'm too pretty
I can't let you hit me
I'm the greatest of all time

Sir DzL, King Of Fighters
Bring on your bigmouths, bring on your writers
They gon' be workin' overtime catchin' arthritis
Bring whoever do ya hooks, bring your choirs

Bring on your phony thugs, they all liars
Makes no difference to Di, I'm on fire
Funky with it, go ahead, touch me
I'm beggin' you, come try to rush me

You weak kid, soon as the beat kick
You already in deep shit, may as well eat it
Put your money where your mouth is
In other words, you are what you eat so bon app√©tit

So long to competition, they can't conquer
Or defeat or compete, I stomp out they teeth
All 32, metaphorically with words I use
Physical? I ain't finna get into that right now

Keepin' on the right route, promote restraint
Power in the pictures you paint
Go ahead, wear your stunnas at night
All the better you don't see me comin' with the right

Then it's the flash of light
From the Polaroid captured right
In your brain, then it's beddie bye
Thought you could chump me like I'm just any guy

Off the street and got comfy
Underestimated, now you on the other extreme
And got me under investigation
To see why Di ain't nothin' to play with

Nathan, no leads
Only thing he gon' see is me punchin' bags
Beats danglin' like cuts and slabs
Joggin' in place doin' rhythm repetitions
That'll have you jaw fall out your face

You got a mouth that's out a shape, you loud and fake
Stick around and wait for me to drown you in poundin' bass
A boomin' system causin' you to listen
Like you in prison

Now you lay down by my feet
Pray the Lord you get up in a week

Sir DzL, King Of Fighters
Bring on your bigmouths, bring on your writers
They gon' be workin' overtime catchin' arthritis
Bring whoever do ya hooks, bring your choirs

Bring on your phony thugs, they all liars
Makes no difference to Di, I'm on fire
Funky with it, go ahead, touch me
I'm beggin' you, come try to rush me

Each fool tryin' to reach through
Is gon' need new fingers when the guillotine sweep through
Tissue and bone with a scissor kick to the dome
Lifted you as if you were floatin', fight officially over

And if it ain't, you gon' wish it was over
As I issue a cobra clutch shuttin' your motor
Skills down like a computer crash, takin' you to the task
Rhymes ricochetin' all through your ass

The movement is black
Already told you it's been proven with fact
How I do it like a student of rap
Musically adapt to any nuisance or trap

Produced by crackpots
Thinkin' that they have a shot
If they can just put DzL on freeze
But cease

I'm Joe Higashi with flow karate
Wrestling gators is a old hobby
Now I battle cobras and eat poison ivy
Shit, jalapenos on the open highway

Which hit like a meteor eatin' your established mind state
How can I lose? My standards are too high
For fools to view, punchin' my kneecaps
With the weak raps that you so proud of not writin' down

I don't care who like it
Obviously style is not a part of the criteria or they not hearin' it
It's disposable and holds no real substance
So as soon as you step in the ring, it's self destruction

Sir DzL, the championship belt you wanted
I'm meltin', fuck it
Bottoms up, it's just a puddle in a bucket
A pot of slush
Yeah

Fuck the material shit
He can't beat me
He ain't got the spirit for this
Plus he ugly and his mouth too big

But this gon' be nationwide
Publicly publicized
You betta hope I knock you out
So you ain't gotta go through the hostile rounds

My tiger kick'll make your eyeballs flip
My hurricane uppercut'll send you to Oz
And while you there, you can ask the wizard
If he can give you a job

They call me Joe Higashi
You can catch my flow on Hitachi
Wide screen, you gon' see how I lean with it
And roll with it

Ol' nigga, they gon' be mad
Oh, it's over that quick? I bought 4 tickets
So I'm gonna give you the whoopin'
You been sayin' I couldn't

Soon as they strike the bell
You gon' lose all sight and smell
You already deaf 'cause your music sucks
So only thing left is your sense of touch

No, sucker, you lost your sense of taste long ago
And I can tell at that ugly ass getup you wore to the show
I'm too pretty, I can't let you hit me
I'm the greatest of all time
