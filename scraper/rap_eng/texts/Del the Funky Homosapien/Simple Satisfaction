I'mma keep it alive, the funk
With this 'lil special device, the funk
It works for me, what's that, the funk
Lemme flip the switch and get it started, the funk

Try to go against the funk, you're finished
You gone substitute, you're finished
DZL, funk from the beginning to the 9th inning
And my team is winning, homeboy, you're finished

Sir D, dirty wordsmith, poetry perfect
So serious with the lip service
Somebody get him a mop
Properly sop up this mess left by the previous guests

Yes, that's an order from the lord of the funk continuum
Any fool disagree, send me 'em, I'll attend to 'em
Quick, fast, leave his ass, pickin' through the trash
Lightning bolt voltage, extra watts

Add pressure to your box, tell it to stop
But Del is a rock, unmovable juggernaut
Astronaut but on the asphalt with my rap vault
Now open to the public for observation
Admiration of how we used to play it

Daze and amaze with flow
Any engagement is like a wedding reception
Hope you get a reception

Don't miss out on this fresh cut, jeah
Tried to told you
I visualize with mind of Minolta, definin' the culture

Move with it, groove with it, body and soul connect
We 'bout to perfect the action
For simple satisfaction
That come from sayin' that we did it

You ain't with it then don't, I don't care
You just miss the boat
Hitler? Nope, DZL, leader of the funk people
And I'mma see you 'cause funk or die

That was the promise so
Deep but wear my heartbeat on my sleeve
Let it vibrate the signal leads
To the thing you need to cling to, to believe

I'mma tell you that it's real, I had to feel
Not in the sense of sensual touch
But you can tell the difference when you gettin' the rush
Not drugs, not to fuck of your buzz
But this came before the additives

Nigga, I'm bad and big, come test it
Words leave you heard, no further suggestions
Swerve to a session in less than half an hour
I got a pad with paragraphs of power, now you're devoured

You ain't allowed to talk 'cause you foul and false
Mouthin' off like a child of God
But you get beat down with freestyles
'Cause you're cheap style
Don't even need to be out, believe me it's wild

Uncontrollable, foldin' you like a bank roll
Jeah, takin' control, I'm back with Zac
Crackin' your wig back with that counter-attack
For that counterfeit bought over the counter shit
I got thousands of scripts from down in the pit

Deep underground where the system crank
Causin' earthquakes, you heard it reverberate
I'm sure that you can relate
If you're funky there's no further debate

Move with it, groove with it
On ya mark and get set, go
'Del the funky homosapien' once again
Sometimes from the end to the beginning

If you can smell the fragrance, tell them dunces
Don't say shit, you must be out your mind
Crazy like a bag of sprayed weed
They way out your league, better leave it to the big boys

Jeah, deep in the land of funk, funk or die
That was the promise so
Deep in the land of funk
