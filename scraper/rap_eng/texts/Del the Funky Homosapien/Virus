[Intro: Sample & Del the Funky Homosapien]
"Global controls will have to be imposed
And a world governing body, will be created to enforce them
Crises, precipitate change..."
*Evil laughter*
Secretly... plotting your demise

[Hook 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
I wanna devise a virus
To bring dire straits to your environment
Crush your corporations with a mild touch
Trash your whole computer system and revert you to papyrus
I want to make a super virus
Strong enough to cause blackouts in every single metropolis
Cause they don't wanna unify us
So fuck—it total anarchy and can't nobody stop us

[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
You see late in the evening
Fucked up on my computer and my mind starts roaming
I create like a heathen
The first cycles of this virus I can send through a modem
Infiltration hits your station
No Microsoft or enhanced DOS will impede
Society thinks they're safe when
Bingo! Hard drive crashes from the rending
A lot of hackers tried viruses before
Vaporize your text like so much white out
I want it where a file replication is a chore
Lights out shut down entire White House
I don't want just a bug that could be corrected
I'm erecting immaculate design
Break the nation down, section by section
Even to the greatest minds it's impossible to find

[Hook 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
I wanna devise a virus
To bring dire straits to your environment
Crush your corporations with a mild touch
Trash your whole computer system and revert you to papyrus
I wanna devise a virus
To bring dire straits to your environment
Crush your corporations with a mild touch
Trash your whole computer system and revert you to papyrus

[Interlude 1: Samples & Del the Funky Homosapien]
"We have already planned"
"The plan is programmed into every one of my thousand robots"
"We will not hesitate; we will destroy the"—"Homosapien!"
"Please, stay where you are..."
Psst, ay, I'm makin' some shit in my basement
Bout to do it to 'em, don't tell 'em though
Alright I love you, peace

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
I want to develop a super virus
Better by far than that old Y2K
This is 3030 the time of global unification
Break right through they
Terminals, burn 'em all, slaves to silicon
Corrupt politicians with leaders and their keywords
F.B.I. and spies stealin' bombs
De-cipitate they plans in their face and catch the fever
Everybody loot the stores get your canned goods
Even space stations are having a hard time
Peacekeepers seek to take our manhood
Which results in the form of global apartheid
Ghettos are trash dumps with gas pumps
Exploding and burnt out since before the great union
The last punks walk around like masked monks
Ready to manipulate the database or break through 'em
Human rights come in a hundredth place
Mass production has always been number one
New Earth has become a repugnant place
So it's time to spread the fear to thunder some

[Interlude 2: Samples]
"Too long have we tried
To extend our glorious empire out to the stars..."
"Only to be driven back"

[Hook 3: Del the Funky Homosapien]
I wanna devise a virus
To bring dire straits to your environment
Crush your corporations with a mild touch
Trash your whole computer system and revert you to papyrus
I wanna devise a virus
To bring dire straits to your environment
Crush your corporations with a mild touch
Trash your whole computer system and revert you to papyrus
