[Skit]
Look out the window
Look at all that bullshit going on down there in the street
What's all that shit floating out in the water?
I'm gonna get- we gotta get out of here
We gotta go to some island
Grab your shopping cart, grab your cane
Let's get the heck out of here
We gotta move closer to the equator
When are they gonna start showing those Mr. T re-runs?
I used to love that guy
Remember how you used to watch
Mr. T... wrestling?
Y'know, Coca-Cola doesn't taste the same as it used to
Remember when a bowl of soup was a nickel?
All that bass is gonna break my ears
