[Verse 1: Psalm One]
Baby what makes you so different than the others
I've been an original since birth, ask my mother
There are so many individuals in this shit
But too many people who don't really share the vision
Isn't it ironic that it's raining on your wedding day
Does it really mean that you should call it your beheading day
Now is that really fair, now tell me is it true
That when you please everyone, you really pleasing you
I see that you confused, what she trying to birth
I'm about my paper caper, I'm putting in work
I am bout my biz bro, I don't have time for stalling
The only type of Stalin I knew, I studied in college
Majored in the sciences but minored in rhetoric
I can break you down and spit it hotter than Devilish
I don't care about the way you do this, you were clowning
I know all about your little movement, bowel

[Refrain]
I don't give a fuck about it
I just want my cut up out it
You can't get around it
I just spent a couple thousand on my Ginsu knives
And I'm taking out my portion, with my Ginsu knives
And then I spread endorphins

[Verse 2: Del tha Funky Homosapien]
Yo these are the list of dudes for sure
Came through the door, using so
Chopping door, stop the flow
You throw up all on your clothes
Switch that shit with H20
Making dough, you can't take the toll
These are unbreakable ain't no more after me and
Apathy, and that's the only thing you grasping, see
Has to be and that's because you trying to take a crap on me
Serve this, whirling, dervish record this
Full force sitting, paring like a swordfish
Pop out your organs, swashbuckling touching ya
Like the muss with tear, corruption, fear
Weird Science, clear and vibrant
I'm sharper than a blade in the hands of Blue Beard the Pirate

[Verse 3: Psalm One]
Who I got to punish now
Funny acting, funny style
Major send-off, they will send you to they Auntie house
When you wanted them, when you wanted him
Why you wanna go there baby you can have a song
And we can have it all, beauty with some good brain
Intelligent, multicultural with a hood swing
You can go with that one though
She had a fat butt but guess what
She bulimic, it's gone catch up, man up
I'm a lady with a goal
Freezer so cold, you can bake em in the snow
No I ain't that hussy you can fuck and then quit
If you fuck me you will definitely never wanna split
So I got my Ginsu, all about my slices
Going to an after-party, all about my vices
All about my whole grain, flowers and my rices
Nice with my devices

[Refrain]
