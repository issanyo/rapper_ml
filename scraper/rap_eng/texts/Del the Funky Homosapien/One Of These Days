Big D's
I've got something to say, man
Uh

The patterns are particular
I sniff 'em out indubitably
Usually very accident against the background
And I don't back down, fools must be crapped out
And they go boss up, huh
Awesome space cadets get a plane or jet over the sunset
Once that vanishes, panic sets in
The vampire anthem is banished to the land of never
Massive measures got 'em trapped in terror where ever I view
Grown adults acting like the terrible twos
I carefully peruse the options
Option one: Start boppin', rockin', sockin', nockin'
Option two: Talkin', but talkin' usually be the least effective
'Cuz people don't respect it unless it's backed up with actions
So action packed vernacular attack your ears
Mass defax the queers
These bastards acting [?]
Slap they lips if they act like they ain't finna catch this trip
If not they catch a brick like "whazzat?"
Huh, yeah homie
Catch up 'cuz time's limited
We ain't got forever, you jerks
While they jerk off, we go to work
We first not last
We bust full blast through the green screen and see things as they actually are
Catch you a bar from the rap bazaar

[Chorus] x2
One of these day you're gonna wake up
One of these day you're gonna wake up
One of these day you're gonna wake up
One of these day you're gonna wake up
One of these day you're gonna wake up
One of these day you're gonna wake up
One of these day you're gonna wake up
One of these day you're gonna wake up
You're gonna think before you say shit
You're gonna think before you say shit
You're gonna think before you say shit
You're gonna think before you say shit
You're gonna think before you say shit
You're gonna think before you say shit
You're gonna think before you say shit
You're gonna think before you say shit

I know fools be on a spaceship
I know fools beyond the basics
They think they are not earthlings
They don't think that's the first thing
They don't drink but they thirsty
Cling close, facehuggers
Aliens, take cover
[?] bustin', flame 'ill fuck 'em
[?] ailments
Got them stuck in their tail end
Don't try to ride on the railing
Teeth end up in the pavement
Leave that to professionals
Baby steps [?]
Say we fresh exceptional
Some that say we left the field

Specialists project the field
Insects smash up against the bitch
Instant anatomy perception shift
Focused compression will crush the ribs
Suffocate pillow to the face they stiff
I'mma crack the safe [?]
Coppers investigate the crib
Wasted effort we in the wind (Shoo!)
