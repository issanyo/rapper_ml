Spark plug baby, Got hearts of fire
Dire Straits acquire the taste for time bombs
King diesel I'm like the pipe bomb
Blowing off your right arm, twice as strong
Right or wrong, I'm getting down
Lower than hell, higher then decibels
Like a sonic boom on que
The night belongs to who
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do

Hey are you ready to go
We're gonna run it till the sun light shows

In the mix with party favors
All the flavors, I'm like a caterer
Macadamia, Poppin ouy maenads
Mouth Piece piece aiming, they can't explain it
It's like I'm an alien, maybe I'm famous
Its all entertainment I'm sayin
That's what's up, I'ma wake you game up
Till the sun come up, straight from the gut

Ooh now, oh-whoa well I hope so
Uh oh cause we're ready to go
Ooh now, devastating, planet shaking
Lights out, here's the show
And all I wanna know

Hey are you ready to go
We gonna run it till the sun light show
And if you're ready to roll
It's do or die mother fuckers so come
On come on lets go

In the arcade with a fifth in my hand
Playing missile command, kicking you ass
High score can't even play no more
I turned it over, Surrounded by chain smokers
This greenery I rolled up is far from
Four leaf clovers, I told ya
We known as hard core composers
Riding bulldozers and roller coasters

Ooh now, oh-whoa well I hope so
Uh co cause we're ready to go
Ohh now, generating, penetrating
Lost all self control
And all I wanna know

Hey are you ready to go
We gonna run it till the sun light shows
And if you're ready to roll
It's do or die mother fuckers so come
On, come on lets go

Hey are you feeling alright
We gonna run it until the sun shine glows
And if you're ready to roll
It's do or die mother fuckers come onna
Come on lets go
