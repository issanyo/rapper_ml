Intro]
Hip hop

[Verse 1: Pumpkinhead]
Blast on the beat with my fitted and my hoodie on
This is soul food for your soul—ask Goodie Mob
A true MC, you can bet a million
I get it in on a track to put me and my city on
Spectacular wordplay
I place words in uppercase form and break laws
Break jaws, break arms, break y'all
Like you was hip hop fan thrown on the stage by Akon
This is NYC, stay as fresh you can be
Like a new pair of dunks off NIKEiD
Like my steez, like Ali
Float like butterfly, sting like bees
Got the little guns try to be like me
Music's in my heart
And pumps through the veins that’s right beneath my sleeves
Murder a track for 300 like Chi-Ali
I stay diggin' in the crates like D.I.T.C

[Chorus: Pumpkinhead]
I got my head to the back, I black on a track
Got the game in a trap and you can't have it back
I'm a hip hop head, hip hop head
Hip hop head, hip hop ain't dead
Give me a beat and some time, I put it all on the line
I told you the last album that I just wanna rhyme
I'm a hip hop head, hip hop head
Hip hop head, hip hop ain't dead

[Verse 2: Del tha Funkee Homosapien]
This shit make me feel like I came out the rain forest
From feeling drained with my brain in orbit
Bouncing back to explain the important
Parts of the art of flow and beats, for those that be
Counting it out, doubting the mountain.  It's amounts
Of influence we have when we do it
This music, whether you think it is or not
It's a different kind of shit we brought
Gifted stop—the kind to get through mental shock
When your homeboard is in a war zone
Not the gated community, the cruelty
That'll make you wanna kick reality fluidly
Make you wanna create graceful dances
Amazing advancements with technology
DJ's receiving accolades from all who see
Still it remains raw—it's all from the street

[Chorus: Pumpkinhead]
I got my head to the back, I black on a track
Got the game in a trap and you can't have it back
I'm a hip hop head, hip hop head
Hip hop head, hip hop ain't dead
Give me a beat and some time, I put it all on the line
I told you the last album that I just wanna rhyme
I'm a hip hop head, hip hop head
Hip hop head, hip hop ain't dead
