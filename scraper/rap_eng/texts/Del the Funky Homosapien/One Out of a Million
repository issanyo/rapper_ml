I deal with the real situations
I'm building, I'm Dzl
I drill it in your grill
Till you feel it
Appealing
To the realists in society
It feel like it's one out of a million
But if one of y'all feel it
I'm chillin'

Dzl. Do it
That's what it is
Nothing big
Get back
Whatever you give
I'm better with this
Young wiz
How my tongue spit
But I let the bums live
Let 'em scrounge
Rebound
Whatever fall down
When I ain't around
Out painting the town
Making the rounds
Haters your loud
Mouth will get you straight beat down
Making the street to where brothers can't even eat now;
That's a cheap foul
My secret vow
Is to beat the style
Into the hard heads who aren't impressed

Who you know come hard as this?
But hard to hit
You relegated to the bargain bin
What parts of this
Game you don't seem to get?
Don't even sweat
We could go through the alphabet
Z through A
Till it's deeply engraved
And maybe you could even get paid
But you don't hear me though

[Put pressure on 'em
Just like a zit
Dumbo.]

I deal with the real situations
I'm building, I'm Dzl
I drill it in your grill
Till you feel it
Appealing
To the realists in society
It feel like it's one out of a million
But if one of y'all feel it
I'm chillin'

Just like an Ice Cube
Got game from Ice Cube
But really he's a nice dude
Thanks to sir Jinx
Cuz he the one who had the right tools
To light the fuse
When I took the mike and went kaBOOM!

Duck down
Structures crumble to the ground
When I touch down
Ain't much cluckers could say now
Rap is my playground
Straight from the bay
My sound represents every color from beige to brown
It's weighted down
So it's hard to snatch
You carbon copy cats is barred from rap
Guard your hat
'cause there she blows
When my nefarious flows
Go where music rarely goes

Stereo
Balance both sides of the fence
Pretty much on as live as it gets
When I'm in the midst
Dzl
You don't deserve
Nothing less than my
Potent words
Read it on paper so you
Know for sure
No BS you see I got it sewn like a seamstress

You typical fool
This is old news
You already know
You got that when you rolled through
Shut up!
Learn how to learn before you start trying to take terms, sucka!
You diamond head sucker, you

I deal with the real situations
I'm building, I'm Dzl
I drill it in your grill
Till you feel it
Appealing
To the realists in society
It feel like it's one out of a million
But if one of y'all feel it
I'm chillin'

Swerving through the bay with the top down
Keep the urban view
It take a bit of courage to avoid the holes
Employ your goals
'cause lost souls talk monkey wrenches
When you're comfy sitting
Humpty Dumpty didn't
So he cracked up;
Couldn't quite get it
Back together he was backed up
Couldn't get on top of his business
That was piled up
And the miserable
The ones who did it the dude
Just smile like "Isn't he cute?"
Watch your step
'cause they showed out to cross your rep
That's game
And it won't cost you zip
Straight from the lip of me, Dzl
That's D-Z-L

The big deal
I'm behind door number three
And you nonpracticing
Platinum chain ()
Lying to broads for coochie credit
Bozos
You don't want it with me
Mister D-E-L
One plus one is two
I don't care what you do
Forget the philosophical topics foo
Think it's a game
So foos popping at you
That's the thing they ain't taught you in school
But I ain't where you from
"But what, what state you from?"
State of consciousness
You from the state of nonsense I gather
Laugh and tease buzzard
Then you get home and count how much money you got
All together turkey, total
You need a hearing aid
