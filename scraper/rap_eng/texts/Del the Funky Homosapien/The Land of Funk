We off to the land of funk
Where you can damn near do anything you want
But take it easy, don't splurge the funk
You got the urge to funk, you gotta make it last

It's a stone gas, I'm the sworn protector of the nectar
I got the juice to get you in the sector
Right on, right here
Come on, let's go while we in the clear

I triumph over chumps and turkeys
And obvious squares who work hard to try to jerk me
First see self then others, be translucent
D did it, maybe they can't do it

Wastin' some good funk, gimme that shit
I'm taxin' you, bitch, at 75%
Next time, keep it like you want it
Instead of just wipin' your ass with it
And then you feel haunted when it's gone

In a song, I define the whole parameter, draw the diameter
Cross the county line, now you're found behind funk frontiers
You punk Negros don't want none here
Au contrair, one snare get my flow beyond air

Land, sea, water and fire to the ether world or deeper still
With a peek through the veil
Frolic with the knowledge that the slumpasaurus exists
Just twist your knob to funk and get a whiff
Smell that, inhale that, it's in the foliage
I'm showin' you the way 'cause lots of fools don't be knowin' this, jeah

{Okay, now you gotta get ready for this part
(What part?)
This one part here, now it start takin' you into this, like ill twist, dig it?
(Okay, okay, I dig)
Okay we gone, keep movin' through right here
(It's, it's creepy)

{Quit whinin', we almost there, Foo
(This is weird, I feel strange)
You're supposed to dig it, just a bar maybe left
Okay, okay, jump, here it is, let's go

Who are you? We don't know who you are
Who told you 'bout our scene? You better start talkin' fast
Don't make no sudden moves, we aimin' our funk at you
I know you must be spies for the barbarians from outside
We're going to funk with you, too late, sucker

We off to the land of funk
Where you can damn near do anything you want
But take it easy, don't splurge the funk
You got the urge to funk, you gotta make it last

It's a stone gas, I'm the sworn protector of the nectar
I got the juice to get you in the sector
Right on, right here
Come on, let's go while we in the clear

What a predicament, you gone and slipped up
In a simple mix up but get stuck in the funk
And we gotta funk you up one time
And you gonna tell us what the funk be on your mind

Outside jive jesters always question the healing properties of funk
But wanna still walk with a chunk
You must be dumb to think you gettin' away scot-free
I got the lock and key

I preserve the funk for future generations
Let 'em know it's the nucleus of new sensations
Best to know where you come from
'Cause you may have to go back, Kojack
But now you didn't know that
I know you need a hearing aid

Here, take a face full of funk and you can clearly taste
The difference in a taste test with the fake mess
Perpetrating musical skill
Got people so confused due to overkill
I'm a little older still, I got a secret
Funk keep me beneath the feces

Underground, on some deep shit
Stress free on the case and then I beat it
Without the sequined glove, peep the love
In each base throb, I take my job

Serious but it's fun to funk
I only came to give you what you want
Even if you don't know that you want it yet
You already peeped game, you just ain't applied it
A-plus my guidance counselor, not my sidekick

Provided a new form of funk that'll pry open your eyelids
Compound 7, now try this special ingredient
But don't be greedy, bitch
Or we gon' funk you up and that's immediate

All rise, fall in line
Everybody chime in on time

Funk is continuous, funkin' is a function
I will honor the the funk
The funk is fragile, handle the funk with care
It's dynamite, it's outta sight
We interplanetary funkin'
Light years away from squares and turkeys

Funk is a form of communication
Funk is power self generated
Funk'll keep the lights on
P, G and E ain't got nothin' on D
P, G and E ain't got nothin' on D

Okay, we funkin', willin' and able
To funk in the world wide funk federation
The W.W.F.F
The W.W.F.F
