[Hook: Susan Jacks]
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do...

[Intro: Del the Funky Homosapien]
3030, way past the millennium, check it out

[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Yo, Deltron thunderforce, ain't no other source
Of sunlight, two ton mic, leave you tongue-tied
Runnin' amok with technology with no apology
Shout it out to my colony with 3rd eye physiology
Millennium past apocalypse is all I spit
Make you swallow it, your weak style, I'll abolish it
With nuclear rockets stay glued to your optics with sci-fi
Unsettlin' man and metal blends
Underground chillin' with the mole man and his whole fam
Inhibit bacteria growth, material growth
Impenetrable, incontestable indigestible
Intelligence, never let a computer tell me shit
It's rapping innovation, penetrating
Artificial life forms, who bite songs
I'ma buy a Vex, lye is next, then I flip the bio-techs
Right into the wireless, your 3rd eye is hit with
Psoriasis, the mightiest, Deltron Zero
Traverse and purged, the travesties, that tempts your ear holes
The area of distribution, lifts the clueless
My flow is like, liquid oxygen, rip it often with
Specific impulse, increase the thrust, grease the cuts
Unleash a cluster of thoughts, I muster
I talk to touch ya', and rupture commercial communications
Convert solar-energy, into imagery
In the minds eye, blind side the contagious
With radioactive isotopes, to decay them
Atomic mass, they small as fragments
I magnetize the avid lies, my radiation shields
Reflect, rejects Decepticons
Who take the truth, and stretch it long, while I bless the song
Next level incredible, metal melding
Flexibility and my engine is never failing

[Hook: Susan Jacks]
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do...

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
All your rhyme histories combined couldn't violate
The prime Optimus operative, use my hydrometer
To see how warm you are, watch me form a star
Hydrogen turned to helium when I shine
Riding 'em revealing 'em leading 'em to the vacuum
Interact with tunes in my digital citadel
Critical pivotal with the mental shit on you
Spit infinity hidden energies too dope
For our planet, star spanning slamming hymns
With mechanical limbs, scanning your lens
With cosmic rays, you'll all get played, your brain's inferior
I hit the lateral and posterior
My science is eerier, ionic bonding
For your moronic pondering, meet the Armorines
My micro machines might throw your team into
Paralysis, they not talented, just a malady
Worry 'bout a salary, creative casualty
Couldn't defrag my power density intensity
Nonequivalence, nine hundred Newtons
Crush you like croutons, you plus you, son
Hiero's like dipoles inside a silo
Turbulence tenfold, never simple
Defies accepted methods development
Most unique, paralyze central nervous when you close to me
Interstellar void fills with color, appears to bubble
And split into four like amoeba
Inhabitin' planets with grandiose boasts
They coast like silver surfer, feel the purpose
High velocity verbal atrocities
Fire resistance, better hire assistance
My pistons glisten ultra high performance
Inside your private quarters where I fry your components

[Hook: Susan Jacks]
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do...
