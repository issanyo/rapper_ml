[Del:] Excuse me ma'am, Domino's, your pizza's here
[Lady:] Pizza? Did I order pizza?
[Del:] 30 minutes or less
[Lady:] Oh well, maybe...
[Del:] Okay, okay
[Lady:] Uh
[Del:] It's a nice house you have
[Lady:] Oh yeah, I decorated it, do you like the velvet paintings?
[Del:] Yeah, well I'll just wait here by the TV
[Lady:] Okay, I'll get my money

*Del grunts heavily out of exhaustion, and ends it with saying "alley-oop"*

[Lady:] Woah! Hold on buster!
[Del:] *Laughs*
[Lady:] What are you doing?
[Del:] I'm sorry ma'am
