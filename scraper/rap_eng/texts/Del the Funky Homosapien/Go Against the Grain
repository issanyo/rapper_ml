My time is short, my thoughts are lazer
Precise and accurate master any phase of
Modern technology, concerning audio fidelity

Finally settling you meddling foes who ain't never in vogue
You just better let go before I get in your dome
And just set up a home to rest
DZL, he only promote the best

Lockin' up to blow the set
Sky high, nice try, nigga
I roll with vets who never stray away
From the flavor, taste some

Oopsie, I threw in some razor blades, ace of spades
I lay naysayers to waste
Prey for grace but act like you want it first
'Cause see me, I'm not at all concerned

Really though you need a hearing aid
'Cause you don't hear me though
Slap you in your earlobe
With funk till you fear it though

My time, priceless, my rhyme, niceness
I got something for you and I think you gone like it
Funk in the fashion, something to blast
In your vast envelope of space and keep a hold of the faith

Build strength to hold the weight
You go against the grain, you get told to your face

Like, eh, dude, I ain't here to grade you
But you way due for a learnin'
Once I drip some funk in your ear
You gone feel that burnin' in your sternum

That's how you know, you ain't fast, you slow
Gimme that, you can't have it no more
You just a victim of circumstance, so fuckin' what?
Everybody got the same story, it's classical
That's the whole balance of the challenge of gettin' there

First you gotta get by the status quo
Assholes with nothin' to do but fuckin' with you
My time is spent on comin' up
With a new way to touch on the truth

Trust in the Lord who dominate over
More than your millions afford
All aboard, you comin' whether you wanna or not
And it's gonna get hot, I saved you a spot

Funk in the first degree on me, have a big helpin'
If you repel it then you start meltin'
'Cause you all jealous
Greedy fuckin' car dealers

A big hoax, no, I don't feel you folks
But I smell you just the same
Nothing's changed, you play games
But your stench I can pick up a mile away

I'm stylin' on fakes who imitate to get a plate
But as you can see you ain't finer
Get a taste of nothin' but the funk, so say your grace
As I invade your space and gauge your weight

I'm real heavy, feel every, nerve ending, bending
Antennas up and catchin' what you sendin'
Focus my attention on gettin' it and keepin' it
Defeat the stress with some funk to digest

Conductin' dialect, just like a symphony
Pimp epiphany when hoes try to trick on me
Ce la vie, they gone be all they can be
Banshees that keep me on my toes, dancing

And I'm light on my feet, Bigfoot, quick and nimble
Your head is thick, you simple
You know who I'm talkin' to, all of you
Ain't nothing wrong, just stay cool

This only phase two of everybody
Play the fool, your move, fool
And hurry up, I ain't got all day
And you gotta move now, you playin' the game

You stay in the game, Jack
Bitch out now and you get sent back
And you miss a turn, now you get to sit and burn
Now you really hot

My time, priceless, my rhyme, niceness
I got something for you and I think you gone like it
Funk in the fashion, something to blast
In your vast envelope of space and keep a hold of the faith

Build strength to hold the weight
You go against the grain, you get told to your face

My time, priceless, my rhyme, niceness
I got something for you and I think you gone like it
Funk in the fashion, something to blast
In your vast envelope of space, keep a hold of the faith

Build strength to hold the weight
You go against the grain, you get told to your face
Told to your face

And I'm light on my feet, Bigfoot
