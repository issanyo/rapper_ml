[Verse 1: Mr. Lif & Del the Funky Homosapien]
Rhyme flurry, just enough to form snow flurry
Storm wording, the verse got clouds swirling
Ground surging my army of troops
You look minute, while yall drop bombs we drop loops
With the verbalized combat, uppercut, devastate em
Yo Del, I can't resuscitate em
But remember we still have mouth to mouth
Some lost their brain, fetch and get it now
Connected through time, we're here to master matter
Pigs use their party to try to capture data
Cataclysmic, wisdom is wizardry with lyrics
Defeat the fictional, it's minimal
A figment of imagination
We see their status through the eyes of a raven
I'm the master blaster, my membership the switch
They're rudely dismissed by my crew of terrorists
There are just two options for rockin', y'all stop talking
2 is Lif hop out of coffin', coughing
We flee the scene with leafy green
My hands will go intangible, we can't be seen
My mummy man plan span Egypt, I'm part Egret
With no regrets skies are my secrets
It's an eclipse we kept in crypts
For when we become Charybdis to sink ships

[Chorus: Lif]
You're hearing this and now you feel the sound
Love the sound, spread it, make it world renown
You're hearing this and now you feel the sound
Love the sound, spread it, make it world renown

[Verse 2: Lif, Del & both]
I think risk is just part of the deal
Whenever I spark the real particles build
Field Goal, fuck my age, I don't feel old
I don't feel they flow --- They don't have the will to grow
I just chill and roll with the fist-a-cuffs
Lifting up the bar that they're all taking pictures of
Define and specialize in rhymes that are spit
Gauck at it like a shiny whip you're dying to get
Private estate flows of mine hard to debate
Go far as to blame but charge it to the game
Your card denied, pardon as we part the sky
The great beyond, cruise it like the autobahn
Ichiban, the shit that Del and Lif be on
You flipped it wrong? It's tragic, you could just be bombed
Pass the coordinates, teleport
Slaughter shit, physically orbited, damage exorbitant!
We morphing men into pygmies, we crush cities
Then rebuild em through eyes of the children
Welcome to this plane named imagination
Where everything you see is for the first time (Fascination)
True amazement, the new engagement, surreal is the realest
We're peeling your flesh back to feel this
We're designed with an iron mind, you see the raw
Then leave in awe, part men, part meteor

[Chorus: Lif]
You're hearing this and now you feel the sound
Love the sound, spread it, make it world renown
You're hearing this and now you feel the sound
Love the sound, spread it, make it world renown
