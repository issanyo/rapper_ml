[Announcer]
Welcome back, welcome back…
I don’t know if you’ve noticed
But we have some special guests here tonight with us
Get on up, you know who are
Yeah, once again, live…

[Verse 1: Del]
Let’s play a game called Simon Says
Let’s see if you can find some bread
Since niggas act like they found the steps
Find out I’m five steps ahead
They got ditched, left in a trench
The foot soldiers missed some steps
Looks like they gotta retrace their tracks
Or face what’s in my missile rack
Zoom, boom, erase their past
This the future, we laid our path
We thought about it, we made our plan
They can’t catch that with a radar scan
Played y’all cast, no addition
They missed the show, no admission
They be actin’, they won’t admit it
A fallen star in the solar system

[Chorus: Del]
I wanna know what’s really going on
What’s behind that wall? I know that I’m not off
They paint a pretty picture but I see the writing on the wall
As soon as they miss a shot, they see ‘em on the ball

[Verse 2: Del]
My word is law, I know they heard that part before
I broke it down to pieces, it’s a puzzle to them all
They think they right on, they couldn’t be more wrong
Well, put this shit together, I can’t do it for you all
They think too small, figure that they’re big shots
If they got the combination, why they gotta pick the lock?
They laughin’ in my face thinking they gon’ crack the safe
But I planned this from the gate, I just watch ‘em take the bait
It’s easy to catch a rat—just put some cheese on the trap
Shipwrecked, they want a raft—about to take a piranha bath
They outta pocket, I respond and act—that don’t teach ‘em, karma can
They sold out for a bargain and, now they wonder why they heart the man

[Chorus: Del]
I wanna know what’s really going on
What’s behind that wall? I know that I’m not off
They paint a pretty picture but I see the writing on the wall
As soon as they miss a shot, they see ‘em on the ball

[Verse 3: Eligh]
Your intellect so microscopic
We kindly request you stay off topic
Me and my friend won’t conform for profit
Been that way since Wheaties and lozenge
Oh, won’t you hand me one while I mop this
Mannequin masquerade, that’s my nautilus
Trying to ascertain as talk shit
Walking Dead coming off so obnoxious
High off the Xanax and they think they rockin’
Put ‘em in a panic, it be stripped of nonsense
But I did not come to kill your cons
I came to uplift, enrich, and launch this
Terrible terrific ceremony of mosh pits
Sucked into the middle of your moniker mantra
Middle finger dangling a double entendre
We fuckin’ it up and you fuck it up with the drama

[Verse 4: Del]
Don’t try to blame me
It’s been sighted, you can’t see
Wrong page, basically
In plain English—they can’t read
Situations, they can’t escape it
And now they on a hate spree
Poppin’ shit like I can’t peep
But sooner or later, they gotta face me
If they got a bone to pick, it’s best
To do that shit in the flesh
Simple—in theory, yes
In practice—
Petro, they gotta let go of ego they hide behind
They would rather try to lie, enslave mentally, the highest crime

[Chorus: Del]
I wanna know what’s really going on
What’s behind that wall? I know that I’m not off
They paint a pretty picture but I see the writing on the wall
As soon as they miss a shot, they see ‘em on the ball

[Scratched Outro]
On the ball…
