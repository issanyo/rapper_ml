Stop playing I'm tired of the pattycake
I'm sitting back like "damn he fake"
Many faces which one today
But when you need me everything is great
BAH! I can see through the silly things
Is it me or is he acting kinda strange
I let him think he know peep 'n' he laughing on cell phone like it's so secret
As far as I see its no reason it ain't my fault he going off the deep end
(*whistles*) long drop
Wheel of fortune, land on me the wrong stop
Your gonna have to buy a few vowels
But dont under estimate boy, ya too proud and that's problem in the first place
Walkin around like you the shit
You can't work that way
But I guess your finsised working
The way you treat other people I guess you finished first then
And everybody else gotta catch up until the day ya humble neva guess huh?
Yeh you was sitting for along time
Now your in the posistion where you want mine
Sure you was riding on da high horse
Till the props dry up then ya gotta sign off
The show has now been cancelled acting like an asshole
And now ya dreams are shattered,but its all about what seemed to have mattered
And ya easily flattered and now your trapped in a hole
Not one (?) truth hit ya skull
Your delusional and cofused about paying dues to who shoes you can choose to style
Now instead of coming off ya pedistal you think it's a conspiracy and everything's ahead of you
Now you walk around grumpy and low
But I'mma tell you something dont fuck with me though
You think you special now I helped you out
With a welcome smile now you talking bout del is foul behind my back
Starting to crusade you need some true game,cause nigga you playin

Stop playing Im tired of the pattycake
Im sitting back like "damn he fake"
Many faces which one today
But when you need me everything is great...
