[MF DOOM]

Let this serve as a warning to all y'all out there who is in charge of these little people
Kill the young ones
It's not the same like when we was growing up
Used to get a whooping and then everything would be good, you'd get back in line
These are divine beings here to usher in the new era, a new age
So if it gonna work
You need to reason with these beings
Talk to them, let them know what's going on
They are unique, angelic beings
So at your own risk if you wanna hit them with sticks
Like they baby goats, kids, call 'em kids
And rile them up and corral them
It ain't gonna work

[Del the Funky Homosapean]

Stop running through the fucking house
[Sample "Stop running through the mother fucking house"]
Stop running through the fucking house

Yo
Lava rock disc jock
Talk million dollar crack rock
Opposition - not
Whole block watch my swat
Gimme got thoughts that jock
Well sought after, rise like astronauts
Tell negros they ain't half as hot
Tell the Beatles the negros is where they took half they plot
Young Diesel, I'm master, watch
How black people flip and bounce anything and smash on y'all
Buttermilk biscuits. This test is clear
Y'all already know DOOM one of the best there is
I confess, I did
The best made me speak crazy
Out the side of my neck about the BET lady
The Caribbean chick before they started playing "gimme the hits"
Any symbiant been in the abyss. Indigestion
Disintegrate real quick. Real spit
Illuminati knew we wylin' with stupid violence
So most of these fools choose silence
While we move mountains and chew diamonds
Like groove pirates on our new island, just commandeered
It's not wrong, it's weird. Sing along and cheer
This your song of the year
Survivor series underground million language
Combined with mercury. Viable first degree
Maniacal verb velocity tossed hands free
Dangling about your city
Batman's memory - photographic, but chilling
Haunt you with visual density
Illustrated word weaponry
Step to me...
Like Big Daddy
