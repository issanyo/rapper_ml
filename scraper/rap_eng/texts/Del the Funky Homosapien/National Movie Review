We interrupt this broadcast to bring you this special message
How's it goin eh?
Today's movie on the Universal National Network is a classic
Starring the two comedic geniuses of North American cinema from the 20th Century
Bob and Doug McKenzie
Entitled "Strange Brew," it chronicles the heroic adventures
Of two latter day renaissance men
Or, to use the correct 20th Century terminology - HOSERS
We give it, three thumbs up
