[Intro: Sweetie Irie]
Wh-whoa
Dis the one you call Sweetie Irie
Alongside a man called Ed Case
With the Gorillaz
The refix in the seat
Na na na all right
Na na na oh
It's a bigger road ting
Cha

[Chorus: Gorillaz]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
