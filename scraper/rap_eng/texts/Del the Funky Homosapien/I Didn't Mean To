[Verse 1]
Alright, I might
Have had a little glare when I stared at ya ho
But I didn't know she was like that
She stared right back
My niggas warnin me that she was comin on to me
I react like a mack do, I act cool
Just to test her, 'cause I'm no jester
I suggest her and her friend be outtie
Because I don't want to make my pal get rowdy
And doubt me, our friendship
But when lips touch, I go crazy in the clutch
Sorta like a schitzo I forgets my bros and pals over gals
I didn't mean to, but when you fiend you do
Strange things for the boot denim no matter who's in em
Grab a flooze then I'm in traffic
Don't laugh it might be your girl that I'm talkin about
I didn't mean to

[Chorus 4X]
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught (I didn't mean to)

[Verse 2]
Another incident when I went way beyond
What I shoulda done
John shoulda stopped before them drawers dropped
But I didn't, ain't no quittin
Really didn't care whose girl I was hittin
I admit skins ain't a reason to lose friends
But then again I didn't know, sorry
Accept apologies and live on
Are we gonna hold grudges? Well, oh fudge
It's a new year and I do fear ya actions
Ya actin shy
I mean ya need to be smackin that ho
Instead of tryin to front on me, ya know
That's exactly how I'm gonna be, ya know
I run my game on any G ya know
'Cause we the most entertainin'
I meant to blame women
For makin me do what the obscene do
When you call I screen you
Sorry, I didn't mean to

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Why do hoes be schemin', dreamin', actin' like demons?
My semen don't give a fuck because they beat skins
Too many girls front cute when they want loot
They tell lies, the swell guys
Can peep it, and that's weak shit
That's why I run game on every freak I get
Born in Oakland, grew up bumpin' Too $hort
I know the rules on a flooze, so who's short
I once had a dunce ho, who smoked blunts, yo
She tried to get me so I looked at the front door
And now she's not with me, so forget it
But every once in a while I'll hit it
And it happened to be your girl
I didn't mean to, intervene through
Your relationship, and I hate dumb dips
But I really can't trip when they ride my tip
I didn't mean to

[Chorus]
