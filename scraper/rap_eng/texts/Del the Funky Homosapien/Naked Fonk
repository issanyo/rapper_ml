What’s happening playboys and playgirls
This D-E-L- I’m here with Opio
He hit me off with this joint and I think I’m going to call it
Naked Fonk

[Chorus]
Naked fonk, shake your rump, make you jump
Naked fonk, stanky fonk, wake me up to that naked fonk
Shake your rump to that stanky stuff, that naked fonk
Come on, take me up on it baby

[Verse One]
Ughhhh, Op laid a turd and it’s good
It’s back girl wash your hands
Before this funk get tossed to fans
Now you gots to dance
You big ol’ gangsta you
Even gangstas boogie
Looky here
Yeah up under the rug
The shit y’all tried to hide, you mugs finin’ to get it now
D-E-L y’all I’m living foul
Running off at the mouth
I talk about niggas who play a game and they hoes the same
Tricks and dicks quickies, pick me please
Saying anything a bitch believe
Dream merchants no reimbursements
Life goes on
So I write those songs that I’ll flow on
Roll one to grow on
So on and so on cold and so wrong
Just don’t be long
D the respond of a predawn
Weak niggas feed on
Once I hit this bump betcha get chumped
Trying to shortchange me, insane D
Bitch blame me
I’m the scapegoat
I’m the plane, the boat, smuggling straight coke
Ooh yeah of this

[Chorus]
Naked fonk, shake your rump, make you jump
Naked fonk, stanky fonnk, wake me up with that naked fonk
Shake your rump to that stanky stuff, that naked fonk
Come on take me up on it baby

[Verse Two]
Naked fonk we gonna make you feel like you on the pole
Now find your soul
Now mine your gold
Now I’m the troll you gotta pay the toll
Once you cross that bridge lost that lid trying to off my clique
Now get off my dick
Now back to the people, I’m attracted to equal all sorts of evil
Cause D will make evil take a sleep pill
Dive into my creepshow it’s illegal
Drug paraphernalia, ice pirates, coochie tyrants, pimpin’ at its finest
Hoes in denial, shows for survival
I only spit what I know
But fools think I’m lying tho
I’m inside at home trying to leave these hoes alone
She said I’m so and so blowing on a dosia cone
She thinks I’m large
Shit that’s mine, she thinks is ours
While I’m asleep, she sleep with johns in my garage
It’s not a thang, I never bought a ring
You know positive thangs is not all I sang
I’ma, I’ma, give to you raw like O.D.B
I’ma, I’ma, hit you in the jaw like O.P.D with this, this, this

[Chorus]
Naked fonk, shake your rump, make you jump
Naked fonk stanky fonnk, wake me up to that naked fonk
Shake your rump to that stanky stuff, that naked fonk
Come on, take me up on it baby

[Outro]
Del ad-libs...
