[Verse 1: Del]
Frankly I don't understand why you hate me
If I'm that bad don't think about me
Only time I think about haters
Is when it's time to get that paper
And express myself
My sports is tuned more than nation wide
You watch hot, is that why so much hate is inside
Because you weak and you can't help it
And want to blame others 'cause you so damn selfish
I'll make you evacuate for months like LSD
Rip Van Winkle you come back guessing
Word force alphabetical rampage
Type raw cuts the scars issue a band-aid
Here prices run pretty high so don't try it
Anything in here you touch you break you buy it
I see a mouth spread sounds that carry far
You clam up you hide out but I feel something very odd

[Hook]
You wrecking the upside
Smoking the vibe
And sliding it on the downside
(x4)

[Verse 2]
Huh, some victory
You ain't living in luxury
You keep trying to fuck with me
The situation cuts deep
For you, for me I couldn't give a shit
On my radar your ass not even a blip on it
So you tippy toe, expend hella force
Hella work just a little roast beef with the blow torch
I never see you in the street but I know you around
'Cause you do little bitch shit when I'm out of town
Feel dread can't live with the raw terror
You search for sleep, you can't 'cause your head hurt
Ow and that's fitting to stay pounding
'Cause you fucking up the game with your charades and prowling
You don't want nobody too engaged in violence
So if I was you I would just keep my mouth shut
Stop meddling, quit being a sourpuss
That's why I don't fuck with you in the first place you coward

[Hook]
