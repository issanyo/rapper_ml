[Intro: Del]
Get it, got it, ya get what ya pay for
Get it, got it, ya get what ya pay for

[Verse 1: Del]
Betcha boogies get broke before the bank get dispersed
When I get pissed because they ain’t shit
From blows, my gang land, they jumped in
For acting presumptuous, ha, well, guess what then?
I’m dumb swift, Charles Xavier need no
Help to read what’s in their skull without cerebral
Complete flow, done deal, I finish each foe
With wordplay as suggested by Ebro
Meet yo’ master now, this ain’t practice, pal
This ain’t a test, it’s actually happening now
Rapidly blacking out and then that’s that
They can’t stop the train coming, I’m Amtrak
Can’t be cool? Then shame on you
Just for that, I’ma rap about everything you do
If you angry, cool; I ain’t gotta hang with you
Someone shoulda taught you better, shoulda stayed in school
Well, graduate; you tried swing, that’s when you grabbed the bait
We gravitate toward the floor, now we grapplin’
You in a headlock, I’m checking you like you bet’ not
Like your step-pops, struggle until your neck pop

[Chorus: Del]
Get it, got it, ya get what ya pay for
Get it, got it, ya get what ya pay for
Hope you happy now, ‘cause I’m satisfied
Glad to be of service, hope you sit yo' ass down

[Verse 2: Del]
Sir DZL spotted all over the measles of all people
Uh-huh, that’s right, we beat you
To the punch, bowl—spiking it, no
Lacing it, yes—now we take the extra steps
Pestilence gets sprayed, self-explanatory
With the proper tools, death is mandatory
I’m a big deal, they just think they is
As they pour some punch, let ‘em just drink the shit
30 minutes later, can’t remember anything they did
That’s typical of how they act but that’s the way it went
Sir DZL, I’m the rust on the razor’s edge
I’m the judge on the bench listening to their defense
Punch keys when I’m bored, I put the data in
Play to win, call ‘em “trap jaw” when I cave they chin
Punishment when they mouth is loose
Whoopin’ niggas like child abuse
Sit down, you fools, they bamboozled
By they own façade, lost in bamboo sticks
Keep your mouth closed, your breath stink
A few mints won’t do the trick, I passed dude some chew sticks
DZL, I weave the rhymes for your amusement
Rollercoaster ride for the suckas, I make ‘em lose it
Url all over they self, spillin’ they juices
Told ‘em, “better watch you talk, you clumsy doofus”
Think they could get with me, they gotta prove it
Trapped behind the 8 ball, I break ‘em with the pool stick
Think that the rules don’t stick when it come to them
Too attached to they own customs and they stuck again

[Chorus: Del]
Get it, got it, ya get what ya pay for
Get it, got it, ya get what ya pay for
Hope you happy now, ‘cause I’m satisfied
Glad to be of service, hope you sit ya ass down

[Verse 3: Del]
Go ahead, try to stage dive, we gon’ let you
No safety net, I bet they don’t catch you
I get juiced and bank the positive fee
Hefty for fuckin’ with D, one punch and they flee
No pillow talk, it’s the brillo caught
In the rat’s teeth, worse than plaque could be
What’s crackin’, chief? Just lower the tone
Ticket you for the noise pollution, you know that you wrong
That’s something I shouldn’t have to say
Every situation don’t call for an act of rage
Told ‘em, “Oh, you loc’in up, I’ll slap your face
Acting brave, need to just act like you have some brains”
One smack, two smack, unravel their braids
Three smacks, discover time travel, retrace their ways
Fuck back in the day, the future is now
Forget about it, let it go, I’m just coolin’ on out…

[Outro]
Oh man, oh man
Funk Pippen, why do you say all that? Why you do that to ‘em?
Man, that’s real…
