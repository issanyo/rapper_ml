[Verse 1: Ladybug Mecca]
One moment at a time, I'm holding on to life
But still I aim high roll it down the pipeline
Cruisin the cosmos, God spoke, check my mind
Light speed breakin all the laws subpeona me
When out my comfort zone santos tickle ear phones
Flows native droppin missiles on your thought-wave
Repetition repetition, it's hindering the mission
Make way, I campaign to hit 'em and then
I give 'em frosty face for the salty stank
While laughing and clapping in the purple rain
Satisfaction gained, smackin' on sugar canes
Belotto straight swinging by my ankle range
Hear the audible gleam, it's the laudible team
Beatintel giving clean cuts you need some
Sixty frames defeat 'em, santos complete them
Chaser sun bather banking cheddar for my forever

[Chorus: Ladybug Mecca]
I'm rising yes, I'm climbing space
Align the stars and I fight with bars
I'm icin hard, yea that's the case
The facts remain, I wax the lane
But I'm glad you came, relax your frame
I'm rising yes, I'm climbing space
Align the stars and I fight with bars
I'm icin hard, yes that's the case

[Verse 2: Ladybug Mecca]
Floaty I direct the flows
Transmit emotional
Ultramag when I speed past
Truth is in the root stash
But no it's not enough
Replenish the surplus, it's time to conduct
From stratosphere to gats out here
Pass you like a draft of air
Been here before, yeah we been here before
Eyeing, fighting, dying years before
Believe the beats is raw
Feed you like a meal, sweet inhale
For fam who feel

[Chorus: Ladybug Mecca]
