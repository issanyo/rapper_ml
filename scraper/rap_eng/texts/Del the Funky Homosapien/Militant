[Verse 1]
Okay, deliberately rhyme great
I never dumb down, you won't get it or job right
Either or form covers all the bases
Flows terrorist, forming words I'm saying
Leaving the future, rocket firmly
They shouldn't understand the bird in on the journey
And it ain't no crooked caper
The previous antidote is good to the vapor
Mr.Bentley, put my foot on a hater
Riding on their neck bone
Pressure on their stepping stone
My trying? I'm fly like airliners
Tuned in, peeped all you hilarious items
Turn on the Ritz, background living from the glitz
Fools fade, they can't play, they on the fritz
What I spit is the tits, they ain't the shit
Anarchy, I don't care, burn down the bitch

[Hook]
What I gotta do to get this shit cracking?
The militant mind state

[Verse 2]
Okay, my antic speech gigantic, titantic
No abracadabra, real action
Street savvy, sweet like cavi
What don't give you make you stronger, but it's magne
School of chrome, the rules are known better
Know your limits, can't be froze or [?]
Rhyme words [?] many with sun tans
Target display dynamics, they learned to run fast
Brothers will know what son of the sleeve won't leave
Apple sauce make your brain catapult, white chalk
It ain't nonsense, greater be the consequence
Haters be anonymous falling into a bottomless pit
Got a problem with it? I'll shut your enterprise
[?] inside until the bench inside
Come wandering out, quantum targeting found
Your sound's harmless, everything you honor
Nod your head to the king, let the Moet glow
Rep your wack ass style deep in the death zone
Yeah, rep your wack ass style deep in the death zone

[Hook]
