[Verse 1]
Nah, it ain't gone, Dzl, player, vote him for major
No kin to haters, grow big in layers
Grow big with labor, throw lasers
Rotators, De La Soul, say it
Don't ask for favors, they doing what they gave ya
They'll do you a favor, if they like your style
If you're worth your while, and do it all with a smile
Oh, you wanna be foul? You wanna step on toes?
You wanna go down the, treacherous road?
You hoping that it gets exposed?
Well, sorry to tell you, it always do, fool
But life continues just without you
Sorry fool, do it how you want it done to you
Though we all make mistakes, I do too
So keep that in consideration, it's true

[Hook]
And that's heavy
My beats is heavy
My raps is heavy
Dropping facts real heavy
As long as you let me
Dzl, I'm heavy
Sometimes you heavy
Somethings too heavy

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing I can do about that, they got a problem
Ain't mine though, go figure it out and holler
Dzl, my mind represents the, dollar sign, like Richie Rich
My ID has flicked the switch, mixed the clique
You can't predict, I make the stick super slick like a pimp
Psychologist, rhymeologist right in his prime, I'm Parliament-Funkadelic braintelic
Started from the cellar but I ain't one of those relics
I'm among the stellar that's literal, critical thought brought me this far
I faced two bricks and tar, sadistic bars
May twist your lid off, escort a team that makes you feel like you're
Lord supreme, I support your dream
War screen, but your words gotta mean something
I see they whole team fronting on the scene stunting
Doing tricks which do me, it don't mean nothing
Cause I keep it simple, I don't need nothing
But food and shelter, music that melt your
Heart exterior. Get to what it really was
Feel me just a tad, you're brother's bad, meaning good
Sometimes I be in the hood
Let em know success you can see in the hood
And it ain't about money it's about if you did what you could

[Hook]
