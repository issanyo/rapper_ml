[Verse 1: Tajai]
Yo, I find it fun to smash emcees into fine bits
I’m goin' to get my just desserts for all the kids I must’ve hurt
I trust that courtesy when dealing with folks is too much for the asking
Cool: I got the skill crafted tools
Massive fools at my work bench and
I'm wrenchin' mics from they grasp 'n'
That's how it has been
The drill's this: I kill swift
I feels I better slay or, hey
My tape measures greater
So now I'm askin' dips if they saw me and they was available
Would they want me to nail 'em all?
Be through, screw, drive her crazy; nut and bolt, lively
Put on your high beams

[Verse 2: Phesto]
I proliferate a quicker fate to niggas, vigorous
Figure I kick stunts; I punch twice that nigga that's dissin' at me
Attach 'em to bats, latchin', and matchin' my cataclysm
I give'em a schism, I stroke to croak her, I broke her
Chokin' up on my syntax, as I bend backs by im-impacts
Then I give a concussion in your nuts when I'm bustin'
Heads, dead with my lead graff
I cloth thee, I swing off-beat, off the
Cerebellum, swellin' membranes
Ten brains couldn't parallel this
I'm carouseling kids while they wallow and swallow hollow tips
You follow and slippin' -I'm rippin' mics nice twice like dicin' kids in fractions
Yo, figure, I tax men

[Interlude/Hook: Pep Love]
Steppin' to Casual (That's when ya lost)
What about Domino? (That's when ya lost)
But if you step to Snupe (That's when ya lost)
Steppin' to A-Plus (That's when ya lost)
If you play the Tajai (That's when ya lost)
Man, steppin' to Opio (That's when ya lost)
Steppin' to Phesto (That's when ya lost)
Fuck with Toure' (That's when ya lost)

[Verse 3: A-Plus]
Yo, I'm willin' to bet, you're willin' to sweat
But illing'll get you - bruised, I kill and I step to crews
And abuse two's and three's, who's the G's that hoes know? (Me)
Me and Hiero, I know, I'm fly, bro
So why flow if you're not invigorating?
I know where you live; there at your crib, I got niggas waitin'
I figure raping is crime, see
I take my time B, and now your G is my G
Now I'm gonna show you how the West Coast smacks kids
Yo, I'm rhyming swell, so to hell with a wack diss
Generalizing, dissing before you've ever seen this
So you can get the middle (What middle?)
The penis

[Verse 4: Opio]
Never the match the miraculous tactics
I smack tricks, the wax is at your wack bitch
I crack bricks over dicks
Who can't come, I leave'm broke and dumb
Def, and plus I'm causin' cardiac arrest, you need some rest
Check, as I'm chiselin' riddles in your memory
Remember me? I hacked your body to pieces disassembling your flows
You bros started trembling from shock and trauma
I'm gonna, end lives when I bomb a
Babbling dyslexic, I make 'em exit
This lifetime, I wake up words, I excite rhymes
I'm enthusin' when I'm bruisin'
Hoes take off their shoes when I abuse men
You're losin'

[Outro/Hook: Pep Love]
If you slept on Del (That's when ya lost)
Steppin' to Pep love (That's when ya lost)
Fuckin' around with J-Biz (That's when ya lost)
Step to Mike G (That's when ya lost)
Smoke on that crack rock (That's when ya lost)
The Souls of Mischief (That's when ya lost)
When you don't know where you're goin' (That's when ya lost)
When you don't win! (That's when ya lost)
Fuckin' around with Hieroglyphics (That's when ya lost)
If you fuck with The Shamen (That's when ya lost)
That's how you lose, proper (That's when ya lost)
