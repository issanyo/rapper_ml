[Intro: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Transmutation, brand new statements
I'll have you gapin' open
Check it out y'all

[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Now let's seeâ€”Deltron Z
Art avenger, let's start the adventure
Hit ya with nerve gas, absurd blasts
Crashin space craft, I'm bio-enhanced
Hiero advanced series, monstrous evolution
Headed, tooth and nail, scoop the trail
Super-sleuth, a new race
Mad creator, savage nature
World Wide Web, the ebb and flow
Light years from watchful eyes while my thoughts provide
Objectives to ostracize the pompous prophecies
Underground societies are hard to lead
Asteroid surfing, castor-oil burping
The darkest side of humanity animated
The grand awakening, plan to take it in
I demand your patronage, mobilize my battletanks
With clusters small, NTR's to empty Mars
Many MC's cruise low earth orbit
Easier for me to use my search warrant
Drift by a star, absorb it, and store it
Leave Taurus porous, my galaxy's gorgeous
Quantum jump, I'm right at your doorstep

[Hook 1: Samples]
"Positive contact"
("Wait a- wait a minute!")
"Positive contact"
("I know perfectly well what it is you're talking about")
"Positive contact"
("Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute")
"Positive contact"
("Even if the record skips, I still rip")

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
Now I catch more wreck with fast ignition
My last decision, pulse amplification
Terror with napalm, I want y'all to stay calm
Alien annihilation, I stay armed to the grill piece and kill beef
20 percent matter, 30 percent is energy
Assimilating to become a living being
Evaporative radiation fades your station
I get high as aviation

[Hook 2: Samples]
"Positive contact"
("Wait a- wait a minute!")
"Positive contact"
("Reactors on!")
"Positive contact"
("Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute")
"Positive contact"
("Even if the record skips, I still rip")

[Verse 3: Del the Funky Homosapien]
I rise like helium, you're falling rapidly
Trapped in apathy, while I track your speed
I'm what you call a legend, dominance with armageddon
Gives me a warm reception
Verbal war with weapons, installation
Blowin the star dust, distance twelve parsecs
Enthuse your phalanx with my literary talents
Just a bit of balance, rip the silence
In space, all-star systems are our victims
Atomics, synonymous with ominous
Implications of information, or information, and entertainment
Cyber-tech dialect, you gotta earn my respect
I'm like Gamera to amateurs, hit em with a cannonball
And in all this confusion
The fusion of music and mind precipitates translucent illusions
Search the ruins with Automator
Hit the walls with a carbonator
Hit-or-missiles, just regenerate
The sonic soldiers allow us to demonstrate
Emergency dispatch, skyscrapers ripped back
From the impact, their flow is mismatched
My style's protected by heat shields and ceramics
Don't panic, I landed on planet Mercury
Gave it atmosphere, set up my headquarters
I'll never get captured here
Rap your tear clap your ear with Soulsonic Mantronik phonics
Turn your brain to an omelette
I'll hold a comet in bondage, with my dominance
Take a space shuttle to escape trouble
Bounce through the Milky Way
Not many MC's feel this way

[Hook 3: Samples]
"Positive contact"
("Wait a- wait a minute!")
"Positive contact"
("Yeah, yeah, what is it now?")
"Positive contact"
("Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute")
"Positive contact"
("Even if the record skips, I still rip")
