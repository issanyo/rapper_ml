[Intro: Del]
Ok this one I'm gonna give a shout out to Yauch
You know, MCA, Mike D, Ad Rock
The Beastie Boys, know what I'm saying
Man ya'll super duper cool man
Hope ya'll doing cool man
Ya'll a big influence on me know what I'm saying
There I said it, some white boys influenced me
Now motherfucker I said it, shit
But anyway, moving along with the proceedings
I got something for everybody
For you and yours and for you too
'Cause I know that you don't think that I forgot about
Your motherfucking ass
We gon' get back to you in a minute
For all my people though let's just bounce to this

[Verse 1: Del]
Who want it?
It's diesel, I'm staring at the stooge who responded
Bruised consciousness is all he gon' get
I'm too monstrous, rap power enough for two continents
Swing with the author with the authorization to
Get farther than the witch doctor
'Cause this doctor be totally free for operations
Because he ain't got no patience
Say something bitch so I can slap half ya face backwards
You know practice makes perfect for certain so
Why don't more practice something pertinent
You are what you eat
And so far I can see
A lot of suckers eat junk food
Whatever's available off the dollar menu

[Hook: Del]
Grand royal
We got the plan that you can't foil
We 'bout to make the whole planet coil
Spring into action, be what you imagine
Yeah boy, grand royal
We got the plan that you can't foil
We 'bout to make the whole planet coil
Spring into action, be what you imagine
Yeah boy, grand royal
We got the plan that you can't foil
We 'bout to make the whole planet coil
Spring into action

[Verse 2]
It's fantastic, I love this game
Just the bland tactics be having me spasm
See the fans' reaction, they tearing they tickets up
They want a refund, they can't stand it
I'm the executor, whatever bitch test that is extra stupid
The next intruder getting electrocuted
Five hundred thousand volts like they ass just dived
In the moat with a portable heater
Then get back at you for ignoring her speeches
About the order of proceedings
She said she swore that she was leaving
So leave then, I see you still here
Baby you move like a slug
Actually moving just can't perceive it
Give me a reason, you know I'm beasting
I got something for that ass, season's greetings
