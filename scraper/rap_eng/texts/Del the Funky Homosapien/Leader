[Verse 1]
Expose this fool, supposedly a dictator of the free world of rap
He about to get tazered, probably hustling about peddling his struggle rap
Hoping that I'm a buddy and I don't twist his cap
If you act like a bitch then you a bitch in fact
Sir Dzl, I ain't tripping, you know it's a wrap
[?] beat down the web master
Acting like he cosigning this dead bastard
I want answers, boy, you better have some
That's what I told him with my clutches as I slapped him
"I don't know what you talking about", he flabbergasted
Certain ways about him, man, I just know I had to bash him
You like sitting back collecting off of other's work
He said, "nah, you got it wrong, I'm all for in the service"
Yeah, you service yourself like masturbation
So all the vicious acts of nature shall remain nameless

[Hook]
Take me to your leader, I wanna see him x8
This the part when we wild out x3

[Verse 2]
Now with little control he held hostage
Wondering how high he'd be accosted
With the rampage, damn, ain't no answers yet?
You better get to yapping, yeah, his as was pet
Before he was acting like the gang God
A swine who gank, that's his day job
You take trust and freak it 'til none remains
You've been handling the shorties wrapped up in this game
Pretty soon he had an entourage
They running around with hopes, but doing his job
He kicking back thinking that he Russell Simmons
Taking money off the top, yeah, I peeped them skimmin'
Wrecking the upside, but let them see
I'mma let this stretch as far as his greed
Pulled a hater move, that was blatant
Thinking I won't do shit, but now his ass is taped up

[Interlude]
Okay, Mr.Smartass, we gon' see what's so goddamn funny, okay? "Please.. I don't know". Man, you making me wanna smoke your ass, nigga. I think you need some more of this. Oh shit, yeah yeah, fuck, man, wake his punk ass up. Shit, I guess I shouldn't have did that. Oh well. [?] with his punk ass laid up. Man, fuck you. You bitch

[Hook]
