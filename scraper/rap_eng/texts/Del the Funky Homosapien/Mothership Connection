[Starchild]
Well, all right, Starchild
Citizens of the universe, recording angels
We have returned to claim the pyramids
Partying on the mothership
I am the mothership connection

Gettin' down in 3D, light year groovin'
All right, hear any noise
Like nobody but me and the boys
Gettin' down, hit it fellas

If you hear any noise
It's just me and the boys
Hit me, you gotta hit the band
All right, all right, Starchild here

[Del]
Well, okay, y'all been blessed
With the finesse of one of the truest and the best
Zac Hendrix is the name, coincidental as shit
It kinda figures with funky presidential, then Del
That is I, the funky human looming on the scene
What you got there sewing in the pot?
Well, we got the p-funk gumbo
Something for the new and old funk and soul

[Starchild]
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
And come on up to the mothership

[Del]
Get on board and make sure you got your funk on brother
You fake the funk, I see your nose there throbbing

[Starchild]
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
And come on up to the mothership

[Del]
I know you wanna perform a single line
One at a time
You will get to see the glory
But the process is the best part of the story
Quit rushing, shit
Zac Hendrix is your selector tonight, your humbo homes
Sir Dzl, knight in funky armor
No need for alarm, we ain't here to harm ya
Just want to let y'all know that funk is what it's all about, aight

[Starchild]
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
And come on up to the mothership
Loose booty, doin' the bump
Hustle on over here

If you hear any noise
It's just me and the boys
Hit me, you gotta hit the band
Ain't nothing but a party, y'all

Face it even your memory banks
Have forgotten this funk
Mothership connection
Home of the p-funk, the bomb

If you hear any noise
It's just me and the boys
Hit me, you gotta hit the band
Doin' it in 3D
Let me put on my sunglasses here
So I can see what I'm doing

When you hear seats rumble
You will hear your conscience grumble
Hit me, you gotta hit the band
You have overcome for I am here

Swing low, time to move on
Light years in time, ahead of our time
Free your mind and come fly
With me, it's hip on the mothership groovin'

Swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down, sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
