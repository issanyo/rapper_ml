[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien aka SIR DZL]
Renovate religiously, imitations ig me
Simply signify on the pygmies
Die hard to the kidneys
Rip through rhythms like Ripley's
Believe it or not, when I weave through the block
Deceitful or not I'ma leave you distraught
Toddlers fake, bottled drank
Mind boggling walls of debate
Pause and break laws and take the proper spot
Our laws debate, carve and scrape
Border patrol the boarderwalk borders the yo
Ward the flow reflect and the ricochet
Hit the core and explode
No one will know, inside job, go with the flow
Spin my bars invite stars ten times large
Solar system can't quiet spark
The revolution has me moving like
A band of Nazis following the hitler
Just swallowing the liquor of the situation
Sicker than the spillited rap agenda
Pen a verse in a hearse windows burst
Cuz shit won't surf
All the way long await
Wanna stay big deal pigs squeal
Furthermore busters eat kids meals
Del Diablo
Model of most bravado
Hollow tip modules
Might hit your car door
Bonafide, know to ride
Out like a large boat
Cross the seven seas more drugs like refugees
Insects especially, bugs hide infesting me
Sended much invested but I invested in weaponry
Step to me east toe
Repeat to the beat slow
The mantra
Serve you the entree if you want some

[Verse 2: Ladybug Mecca aka Santos Vierira]
In the midst of this life pulse
Slowly hear my light leak
It’s brick cold b & blinding yeah frigid peep
Neta de Santos raizes em Campos
Sórdida
Nada for this gata
Gatisima turn they destruction into pasta
And ingest and spit the eloquentest
Bars ain't[?]
I'm hard to measure, emotional algebra
Making obscure articulate
Leave you like unfinished kiss
Seeking again and again
You been and she a fighter
Set fires till the ending
A passion you can't fathom again
And left straggling, crooked walking
A flash of vertigo

[Verse 3: Kool A.D.]
1990 something Kool intergalactic
Backpack Richmond - slash - El Cerrito
See me steelo bro
Lampin' like its the Hamptons tho
Swing the John McEnroe
A man a plan a canal panama
That's a palindrome
I don't fuckin' know man
I'm rapping
Yo, yo, it's a talent show
Still you gon' remember like the Alamo
Alameda calico man yo
I'm magnetizing, magnificent mindset
Telepathic moving through hella traffic
Style's so circular
Thought it was a circle boy
I serve to swerve purses
And hearts from hers towards hearseless avenues
Observe how these words have attitudes that speak platitudes
That bang on your chest like a Jesus piece
And breathe peace and gratitude, but still churchless
But shit I might still run up in a Church's Chicken
With a biscuit like, "give me all your chicken and biscuits!"
Shit I might cop a 3D printer and go print up a biscuit
Then rob the chief of police of the city of Richmond
And chief up in the station touching titties and swigging
Up on firebird (thunderbird) listening to Chief Keef
While watching muted youtubes of the lyre bird
Who's your A&R?
You outta fire yours
My A&R is Amaze 88
Lauren Hell and [?]
And whoever is on KMEL
Plus the weather plus the salmon and crackers
That I was eating and hibiscus ice teas that I was sipping
Plus the laughter of children
Echoing around the corner of the last evening
What... the... fuck?
Plus the feeling of freedom I have from wheelin' and dealin'
To buy the food that I'm eating
Even though a lot of people are not eating
And I'm seeing that and it sucks and I'm not feeling that
But what can one man do?
I don't know probably a lot
Y'know, it's probably a lot of shit, really, yo
My name is Kool A.D
And I say a lot of shit
You don't even really fucking need to listen to all of it
But some of it is nice, and this joint?
This joint's hella nice
Like fish on yellow rice
I kick like cenobites
My bitcoins hella byte
My shit, boy, hecka tight
My wrist, boy, hella ice
Jokes but still wreck a mic
Smoke until my head is right
Hustle till the lettuce ripe
Cut a couple tracks until I get it right
Chuckle when I run it back and it sounds like I ain't said it right
But that's whatever man
Kool Mike Jack, Peter Pan up in Neverland, (pause)
Man I'll just never be Nas man
But I'll never fall off like Adebisi's cap
And I ain't even seen Oz
I just listen to Clipse
You ain't never heard my mix
Just listen to clips
So you can't tell me shit
Better cop all my shit on the Internet
And listen to them
Before you try dissin' 'em
Kool straight glistening
Are you listening?
Man, hey, it's crazy man how I straight piss on them
We be to rap what key be to lock
And y'all be to Ja Rule what he be to Pac
And I said that line last week in another track
But Ladybug's right here so you know I had to bring that sucker back
Oh snap I feel like the rap Mark Zucker-black
Y'all fucky 'Bergs can't fuck with that
And even if you could, you wouldn't
Cuz you pussy
