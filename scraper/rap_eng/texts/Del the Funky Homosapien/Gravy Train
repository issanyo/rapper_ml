[Verse 1: Del]
If that’s all they got to offer, no need
‘Cause their homegrown weed got ‘em so high, call it nosebleed
Haters wanna shave the points like a goatee
Then they could join the winning circle with no team
Keep on crossing the line, don’t know what “no” means
But don’t own a thing, they gonna end up broke dope fiends
They should listen more and speak less
It only show they stupid, that’s a sign of weakness
Deep threats from shallow minds
That’s why they repeat it and I told ‘em a thousand times
They wake up just looking for beef
You know, free-range cattle, they hoof in the street
Couldn’t peep, they mind close
I don’t see what they gon’ find with their eyes closed
Better not ask me nothin’ like I know
I keep the pest outside just like a slide though
I go, they stay still
Moved into Disneyland ‘cause they ain’t real
Fools tell all damn day like it’s a big deal
Can’t run with me ‘cause the rule is you can’t squeal

[Chorus: Del]
They on the gravy train
They actin’ like they put in work and they be playin’
They want a free ride like the rest of these bums
But be duckin’ when they see the conductor come
(They think they got the winning ticket)
They on the gravy train
They actin’ like they put in work and they be playin’
They want a free ride like the rest of these bums
But be duckin’ when they see the conductor come
(They think they got the winning ticket)

[Verse 2: Del]
I don’t be going nowhere, I stay embarrassed
By dummies who repeat everything just like a caged parrot
Who the cap fit? Let ‘em wear it
They gon’ catch wind when I open up and start airin’
As for rappers, no comparison, I’m twice as hot
Niggas rappin’ today must be high off of micro dots
No merit, too little to notice like a micro knot
They ain’t even liked a lot despite all the hype they got
That’s the price of pop, and they gon’ pay it, too
Funny it took getting fooled to know they a fool
Niggas wanna rise and dunk and run game on you
I told ‘em, “Game over, I ain’t tryna play with you”
Now, make a move, I’m just tryna see
If they act an ass, then left behind they’ll be
That’s it, no room for advancement
They topple backwards after they get backhanded

[Chorus: Del]
They on the gravy train
They actin’ like they put in work and they be playin’
They want a free ride like the rest of these bums
But be duckin’ when they see the conductor come
(They think they got the winning ticket)
They on the gravy train
They actin’ like they put in work and they be playin’
They want a free ride like the rest of these bums
But be duckin’ when they see the conductor come
(They think they got the winning…)
