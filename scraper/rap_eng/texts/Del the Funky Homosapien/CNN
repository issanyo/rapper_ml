[Del tha Funkee Homosapien]
Nowadays the power plays make you wanna about face
Enough to give you the sour face once you hear what the crowd say
See I be around the way where you can hear the sounds of today
Some of that sound is bound to escape through the urban city whirlwind
Call me the epitome of wordsmith, every bit as enduring
As your commercial favorites, save you from the surface chambers
I'm giving birth to bangers, underground, they surface later
Furthermore, I'm squirting flamers when I hear the words from haters
Yeah, that's words of fury when I'm on my tour of duty
I stay calm, you're unruly, Quiet Storm, you're too moody
Pirates on the open waves, fire on the hopeless knaves
Time moves on, I grow with age, biting down with cobra fangs
Eyes wide open, I know the game, divide my focus, I know my lane
Trying to ride over my flow to reign, asphixiate you like a choke chain

[Sample]
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free

[Ladybug Mecca]
I'm in the core with the surreal, no ordinary feel
Dreams pass into action and mingle with Sir DZL
Illuminate, don't fizzle, then find me in the zone
Stand alone in my duality, we taste life twice
I see it as I am, as I like
Feeling light and vaporous
Wordplay with A.D. and us
Kool as fuck
And Coolie High
In the shire
Replenish me
I'm the source to core, you return for more
Guidance
Through this delicate play
Headfirst in too deep
It's the shallow lane we avoid like creeps

[Kool A.D.]
My raps run laps around tracks like Usain Bolt
Michael Phelps with insane gold, I trained for it
Easy listening pissing confetti from your car's stereo faceplate
There he go, vacate
Away, way on some other necks
Fresh, the brother flex
Vagabonding in the Western world, yo
I think I'm Phil Lynott, or was it Phil Lie-not? Sure, why not?
I think I'm Jim Fitzpatrick in a Che Guevara t-shirt
I'm so Anne Frank, I hit that attic with a bad bitch
And hide out for about two weeks
Just to meditate on the two cheeks
Dawg, I Federlined that [brooney?]
Wait, oops oops, I mean Britney
Man, I'm off a deuce-deuce of that O.E
Now she calling me like "boo, see"
Ha-ha, hee-hee, ha-ha, ooh-whee
You're [?] tooth and no speak
Kool bring the news like it's Newsweek
Y'all not... me, y'all
Too weak
I'm like CNN, go ask Chuck D and them
Get the R. Kelly tape, see how we pee on them
All the new moves, please know that we on them, heh
You see my friends? Sip beers, burn trees
Kick weird words, B
This here, surely
Could lift ears to worlds we could miss if
We did not listen properly

[laughing] Oh, but seriously

[Sample: Q-Tip, "Oh My God"]
I don't know, man
I don't know, man
I don't know, man
I don't know, man
I don't know
