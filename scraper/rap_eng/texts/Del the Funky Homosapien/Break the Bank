[Verse 1:]

Yeah, after the money ?
Sidestep your funny talk
The bum-rush ain't ever gonna stop
Watch your ass belly-flop
Dummies trying to tell me what I should do
When they barely cop
Enough for their basic needs
Trying to hate on me
Pump your brakes before I make you bleed
My ?commentation? gets different denominations
For the breadbasket
The shit's classic, on some jet black shit
Passing you the wildcard
Anything's possible when I drop a flow
Your whole style fraud
I apply hard pressure
To make you foolish dudes fess up
?West? up, foes down
With your old sound
Broke with nowhere to go now
Rodeo clowns trying to evade the bull
After acting like they taking it by the horns
You can't ride the ?
You get launched
Once you hit the ground, get stomped
Into human juice you stupid dufus
Having you running like mucous
Pursuit is, swift and challenging
Throw off your balancing
Vertigo
Hurt your flow
Crown the king!

[Hook] x2.5

Things can't stay the same
They got to change
Get that in your brain
Contestants, you're low rank
Despite what you think
I'm about to break the bank

[Verse 2:]

I'm coming for the money bag
Punishing your ugly ass
Not giving a damn where the fuck we at
Call the authorities
You all disorderlies
All will be handled accordingly
And who ain't supporting me
Fine! They small time
Complaining about nickels and dimes
? in the ass?
Ridiculous to ask
Why you asinine
The absolute last in line
?Nonessential? moron that's monumental
All you got is what your momma get you
But I'm out to break the bank
Ain't gonna be nothing left
When I take the tank
Out for a Sunday cruise
Crush your crews
Flows'll ? in ?
Busted through
Then puss will ooze
Whoever you entrusted to
Get a couple, too
Just to prove
Don't interrupt the dude
The feud that ensues
Will leave you subdued, abused
Roll then you lose
Come up with a blank
With nothing to thank
You better tuck in your ?chain?

[Hook] x3
