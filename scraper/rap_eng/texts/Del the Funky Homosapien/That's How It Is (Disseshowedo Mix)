Yo!
Get the fuck off my dick and let me rip this shit!

I write raps
And when niggas bite, I clap
'Cos their shit sounds better now
You done let me down
I thought it would be dope, but instead
Your shit's dead
You gets fed
To the alligators lurking in the moat
Peep what I wrote
You bit so hard, I though your shit was a quote
But still I'm taxing, axing the competition
And any wack men, I stomp & dis 'em
Easily
And you can feel the pressure, plus
When I bust MCs'll be
Trampling eachother trying to exit
When I flex it
The way I wreck shit is not unexpected
Niggas just lose when I choose
The best crews of MCs
And turn 'em into refugees
I slaughter a lotta MCs that are the
?Styles I compiles?, and cut 'em up like ?vows?
Think to yourself I write the shit
So you can bite the shit
And I'll know, despite you get props
(To da beat!)
Niggas get dropped

Sample: That's how it was and that's how it is!

Enough with this wackness
Enough is my ?check?
Enough with these motherfuckers biting DAS EFX
I come real when I show skill
(Hey, yo, Saafir!) You macked on that ho ill
And that's for real, my flow still
Is everlasting, niggas forever blasting
Shots when cash gets hot
You're not fresh, so you hating when I be just
Ripping microphones without stating the obvious
Now how much harder can it get?
Niggas try to flow, but they soundin' like me
A year ago
Shit, old, kaput, I got loot
To the hoes I'm cute, and so I always got boots
It's me, so be free to feel the ?Ivy swing?
More niggas got my back than Rodney King
I feel tight, knowing that the shit I write
Will be exposed to foes, and everyone will feel fright
And you'll run and tell your man, "Yo, peep this twist
It's real, try to practise." But the mack is
Way ahead of ya, instead of ya wack sound
I'm kickin' shit to make MCs back down
Got rhymes that kills, fills many empty heads
Niggas can be dead, I got 'em in line, like ?Stimpy?
Red light, slow that shit down, bring it to a halt
You're wack and it's all your fault
