[Intro: Ice Cube]
"Ayy what's up man?"
What's happenin'
"Ayy, is that nigga Del yo' cousin?"
Yeah man he my cousin man, you know. I been tryna have him do like some gangsta shit, you know?
"Yeah.."
He ain't with it man..
He be-
I guess he's like that handkerchief hat-wearing ("hah, yeah hah") muthafucker..
Yo man, don't pay no attention to him man, he's kinda weird you know, but alright..

"Oh yeah"

[Del the Funky Homosapien]
Del made a pact to be well natural
Back from the wishing well to sell actual
Funk from the fungus grown in the trench
It's getting kinda heavy so I gotta pinch an inch
And it's a sinch
To let my hair grow like a plant
Eliminate the fat gold chains and the diaper pants
Trade 'em for a pair of Girbauds
Never make friends with the fraudulent foes
Yes I suppose that I'm fat from the supper
Skinny from the many that try to eat plenty
Now I got to flip on a copper like a penny
Vise uh versa
Quench your thirst with
A swig of grapefruit juice straight from the thermos
Hock your jewels, and you can drop your tools
And make a move that can turn us in the right direction
Show your affection, as I correct men
Who try to pull the wool over third eye
Comin' fly with Mr. Greenjeans
It's a bird eye view of the Meadow
As I greet the many people that I meet with a "Hello"
"How do you do, my compadre?" "What up Kwame?"
Back to the Meadow so I can show I'm a
Smooth black brother that is gifted
And if you try to lift this, yes I got a witness
Nicknamed the Emperor
This wasn't meant for ya'
Ya little crumbsnatcher!

[Outro: Ice Cube and Del the Funky Homosapien]

[Ice Cube]
See what I mean man?
Damn!

[Del the Funky Homosapien]
I wish my brother George was here..
Heeh..
