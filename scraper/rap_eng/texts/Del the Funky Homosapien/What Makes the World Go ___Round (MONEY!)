I'm hip, blue chip makes glasses connect
Filled with champagne, toast to the bread we get
The bigger the building, the bigger the foundation
Peep how Wall Street is pimping our nation
I feel bossy, watch my dough rise
Kick folks in the street, glad I ain't those guys
The bigger the building, the bigger the foundation
Peep how Wall Street is pimping our nation
When one wins, someone loses
That's the chances
It's competition, relieve finances
So far but we reached our consensus
If not, we'll meddle with consequences
Traffic and bills, freeway of exchange
One-way ticket, y'all lose, we gain
USA, wave the flag like gang colors
Bang on, but you'll be glad I came, brother

CHORUS:
My money ain't funny and it keep coming
I welcome the money and the cash
My money ain't funny and it keep coming
I welcome the money and the cash
At the welcome mat swollen fat
In stupid stacks, the cash
My money ain't funny and it keep coming
I welcome the money and the cash


Wall Street is rigged like a 14-wheeler
No one gets the plot and we're not revealing
We got to live like emperors
We ain't going down
We stay in the 1%, you under it
It's like they sent the hellhounds
On an ice cream cone
How the global meltdown
Financially, they ain't catching me
They can't capture a phantom they haven't seen
Fuss with your folks all day for crumbs
You work, we play
Hooray for us
We're the master puppeteers with the leverage
Sneak up behind and get a wedgie in
With technology people are obsolete
Fossil fuels is all you are to me
Hugs go out to the world, I love you, fam
Backslide your cash, I call that sleight of hand

CHORUS

Call us super rich, we're hero to y'all
We hedge bets, scalp
You give your half off
Trust us, of course we'll give y'all a job
One day you too can live high on the hog
Wrong, you get
Left in the hole starving
Hit the margin, so what?
That's your problem
Hoard that bread just like the nasty hooker
Heels crack the concrete
She walkin' crooked
Lookit, all the assholes you see as stars
All gonna be broke -- yep, the world is ours
Put a twist on it too, like a Hefty bag
In the end, it's fittin', what's left is trash
Whistleblowers hiss like cobras
If we sense resistance, it's over
Bull market, bear market
Wild kingdom?  Yes, you the target

CHORUS
