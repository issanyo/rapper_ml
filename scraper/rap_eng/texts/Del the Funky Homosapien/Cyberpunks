"It is the year 2387
Man has relieved an overcrowded Earth
By the establishment of planetary colonies
In other star systems of the milky way galaxy
The most successful of these colonies
Is on Maris, a planet so Earthlike, that many call it Earth 2"

(CHORUS)(2x)
Cyberpunks, MegaDel, ultra violences when I adjust
Future phenomenon, you need to try it once

MegaDel Cyberpunk technology such as cyberbots
Check the rhymes I concocked, private stock
While you jock I set a ultra security
For MC intelligents who wanna murder me
It's like the third degree
The way I question my sanity
I work on cybernetics as a form of vanity
To protect my circuitry I stay under the canopy
I send the special ships to finish my fantasy
To become a bionic commando, monitor scandals
Solar panels reflect, energy enters me
MC's energy in the 21st century
Soling temper release, fusable alloys like musical cowboys
Super bomb raps, capable of alien contact
With rhyme pacts, create galactic soundtracks
Profound facts to word classify invoke for several decades
By the C.I.A. or now pedal death codes on the internet
The center's flesh, I smoke a pinner of bless and can't remember next
Transmission control, you better listen to your soul
When your carbon base creatures connects with technology
Brand new species, devoid of ecology
Totally electronic they monitor and follow me

(CHORUS)

Escape the cold flu, still down with kung fu
Back then they hung you, but now they fun chew
I touch the escape key, a blue light envelopes me
Covers me with energy and sucks me in the screen
I met Tron, he said don't let out about the cyber universe
Because you the first human to discover us
Neon lasers with colorful photons
I felt like voltron my hands turned to silver
Probably woulda killed ya, I just lost my sanity
My brain was enhanced with super intelligence
Shoot the elements, we stowed with a charged beam
Victory was our theme, packed more silicon than sardines
Transformed into a plane like star screens
Cyberpunk, rockin' the mic with auto targeting
5th element, the strength of six elephants
It was miraculous the way they pashed me in
Equipped with electric grenades
Testin' my phaser, I melted some glaciers, wow this great stuff
Powered with voltage, a technofile armed with explosives
Missiles, a crystalizer
To freeze MC's and then shatter them with super bases
Around relentless pound against the ground
Like an asteroid, a metal bohemive
More than you can dream of, a morval team of
Both sides of the brain
Transmuted to my physical form to ride the train
My eyes had a neon green glow, I seen foes
Instruments self destruction, made for huntin'

(CHORUS)

Controllin' cyberspace like a girl's private place
With a chassity belt, I has to be felt
Futuristic crucifixing super diction
With computer victims, terminated through the symptoms
To virus', sophisticated and bizaare
Enthrawling, I even serve smart drinks at the bar
Bonzai, mechanical tenticles hard times
For small fry who tried to hog the mic
You saw the light, took all the stripes
Stop the spying theives
That I percieve when my optics turn lime green
In this industrial environment, there's certain requirements
The mental training that helps you see the Leviathon
I'm pilotin' a giant mecha in my private sector
My invisible forcefields of course yields
The inner sanctum, better do the interface
Master programmers create aircrafts that look like dinner plates
The Zentraedi mobbed me
I did concert on their planet for 5 G's
Space the last frontier
Another make you pass on beer, we hellucinagetics with speed

(CHORUS)
