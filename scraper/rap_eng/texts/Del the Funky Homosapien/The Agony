[Verse 1]
My planet, my homeworld
Deltron Zero, plunder any and all - you're first
Time has come to simply start
Living again, we have come to damn far
Existing only for benefits of other's like worker bees
Until our birth is seized like Hercules
I burst and squeeze laser cannons
With a team of freelance mercenaries we standing
On our personal starship, with entertainment modules
Immerses you inside a world that's all gold
Artificial, our ship is hard to hit too
Transport vessels we strip down to the nickel
Undercover agents with valuable information
About our winning aces against embassies and enemies
Shards of flying shrapnel  destroys any objects closer than detonation
Leave em vegetation

[Hook] (x2)
Baby if you knew the agony
If you could see...
(rock these new flows, rock these new flows)

[Verse 2]
Now you're witnessing the quick thinking
And dexterity of a sick genius
Deltron Zero, you a bit squeamish
Cause I'm rumored to brandish turbolasers in a fit of fiendish
Military demonstration destroyed in the blast, any trace of information
Related to my grand schemes garnishing support from other agents
Who can't take it no more, going apeshit
My titanium funk reborn could be created
By gaining absolute power over my creations
From presentation to demonstration to penetration
To your psyche where you can take the reigns and
Form your own conclusion I restore your freedom
Before the industry made it a commodity you needed to buy back
Just a consumable that's regulated through legislation
They make you jump through the Matrix

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3]
Superior technology wielded by the oddity
The loose cannon, the lyrical major prodigy, Deltron probably
Who else could melt a docking bay officer to fine fermented ale?
The primary source of support for starfighters
Sending counter attacks to black out return fire
My favourite, the heavy ion cannon
Blue-white energy will fry y'all planet
But not before I infiltrate your information network
Spy operations, relocate the wealth first
The projected holograms, were a scam that we recognized from the jump
Giving the illusion of some
Form of camaraderie, esprit de corps
But they needed more, they had to flee or be torched
Society disguised and these dream loops
Became very difficult to see through, but we knew

[Hook] (x2)
