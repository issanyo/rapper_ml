[Intro]
Apologies for the tirade that I went on on the last song. That ain't for everybody, that shit's for like the few motherfuckers, you know what I'm saying? Like, you know, you know. You got your little [?] that are hard to exterminate. But that's okay, I got some raid over here, I got black flag over now. Punk ass bitch. So you just bring your ass along, I got something for your ass. But now, right now, we gon' have some fun with some ill shit. Cause I'm that ill dude, Diesel. For my peoples. Let's go. Yeah

[Verse 1]
Sir Diesel, night to the folk table
Bump haters who on payroll
Know they gone, stay rope
Dance to that, tailgating and get shook hard
Put my soul inside, you know it's good heart
Fuck the phantoms, they can't swim
Funk apples from outer space, we slamming
Down your neck bone, rep for the throne, that's mine
Only a personal goal that bursts through your soul
Whole anatomy, move to the calamity
Agi tragedy persist upon the faculty of backwards beats
Trying to chase the trail wagon
Chase their trail wagon, circular
Worst of all tried to bag on me while I bask the beat
Flow hard, smooth transition like a sports car
Relax, ghetto barbarian is in
Pepe Le Pew can't do what I did

[Hook]
So robust, flows I disgust
No one told us, I know this shit scrub

[Verse 2]
Delta time catch swollen sideburns, been order
I don't feel mad fooled, disclosure
Diesel, hold your tongue or face apathy
Cast iron faculty, bag down debauchery and depravity
Our cake flows, they wave at me
Prove they got ADD, they ain't fading me
Fuck nostalgia, we doing it right now
Convos fly around, lights out, quiet sound
Yup, quiet sounds, freak the oxymorons
In the proximity, then I toss the chorus on
You boring, pa, let me freak the foundation
Twist it with some futuristic flavor, leave the ground shaking
Oh yo, don't try to fandangle
I eat 'em up like a bagel, hold the mayo
Don't say no, take this shit like a man
Hyper activity mode, remote control the gym

[Hook]

[Outro]
