Here we go again y’all against all obstructions / Fuck them / Im
D-E-L, a man against some munchkins / Ever since toughskins
And underoos I had to choose / Said I was never gonna lose on a
Count of niggas who stumbled through / She didn’t think they’d
Stick / Friends of me and freaks who eat a dick / Usually, I read
Them quick but always seem to keep it in / Always something
Problematic / Always got involved in static / Calling me names or
Try to game me / And when I change me but make me angry /
Same things niggas do to marks / I figured they could use a talk /
I’ma good listener when crew departs / When show times over
And its through the heart / At that point no need to ask / No more
Talking I’ma beat that ass / But if I’m at fault, I need to ask them
Thangs before I spaz

Chorus

Im putting my foot down, my temperature is burning hot (
Repeat 4x)
Ok, I’m putting my f.o.o.t.d.o.w.n down, my temperature is
Burning hot
I’m putting my foot down, my temperature is burning hot (repeat
2x)

It’s big, it’s small, it really ain’t nothing at all / But it gather like an
Avalanche / So I’ma stop it now while I have the chance / For the
Funk will surely flow / It’s only me, my theory go / Bitches must be
Pretty slow / Thinking what they say I’ll go for / No sir I’m extra
Cool I’ma let go on do what they do / Fuck you fool say what’cha
Want to / I can see that’s what you love to do / Just don’t touch
Me cause I ain’t touching you / And I know you weak as hell /
Cause I treat you well and that’s the reason why you speak to
Del / Like a fan of D-E-L you need to go and read a book / Or
Take a hint your free to look / But no you want to be a crook in my
Neck / That’s causing pain / Sometimes I think you all insane /
Cut me off all in my lane / But you can’t cut what’s in my brain /
Think I’m playing but I ain’t / You think you staying but you can’t /
Don’t be quaint, I’m in the paint / I’ma bust that shot to make you
Faint

Chorus

I’m putting my foot down, my temperature is burning hot (repeat
2x)
I’m putting my f.o.o.t.d.o.w.n down my temperature is burning hot
I’m putting my foot down, my temperature is burning hot(repeat
2x)

Here we go again y’all against all / Who get all pissed off at
D-E-L like they situation is his fault / Bitch all you want / My
Niggas is up in the front they smoking blunts / And you get the
Hunch they ain’t gotta be told more than once / Bridge over
Troubled water / We finna to bubble harder / Sayonara, I don’t
Harbour bad feelings / Cause I know karma is like a boomerang /
So fuck finding who’s to blame / Now maybe you should change
/Girl, I ain’t playing your stupid games / So I shook you / Why I
Don’t use your name / I know all the spots you used to hang / But
I don’t really boost or bang, I used to / That was a youthful thang
/ Now I just come out my nigga bag to spit on fags, when they
Shit on blast / Man I’m too damn old to play around / I’ll let a
Motherfucka just lay on the ground

Chorus

I’m putting my foot down, my temperature is burning hot(repeat
4x)
Ok I’m putting my f.o.o.t.d.o.w.n down my temperature is burning
Hot
I’m putting my foot down, my temperature is burning hot(repeat
2x)
