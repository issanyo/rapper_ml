Yeah, I smell kinda good, I mean
[Incomprehensible]
You know I gotta take a whiff
Know I gotta take a whiff

I'm so tight, I'm so tight
I'm so tight, I'm so tight
I'm smellin' myself

I'm so tight, I'm so tight
I'm so tight
I'm smellin' myself

I'm so tight, I'm so tight
I'm so tight
I'm smellin' myself

I'm so tight, I'm so tight
I'm so tight
I'm

I'm checkin' under my underarms
Lemme take a good whiff, lemme see if I stank
I don't need deodorant
In the mode, I spit, I'm the global event

Told them this but they don't know when to quit
So I blow 'em to bits, smell
It's the African funk, fresh from the motherland
Better than the other brands on the other hand

You be the judge, tell me how you feel about it
I got a buzz, it is what it is and it do what it does

Because
I'm so tight, I'm so tight
I'm so tight, I'm so tight
I'm smellin' myself

I'm so tight, I'm so tight
I'm so tight
I'm smellin' myself

I'm so tight, I'm so tight
I'm so tight
I'm smellin' myself

I'm so tight, I'm so tight
I'm so tight
I'm

The funky homosapien is a new species
He is the shit, at least he's the feces
Completely in tune, you can't eat me, yeah

The funky homosapien is a new species
He is the shit, at least he's the feces
Completely in tune, you can't eat me, yeah

I know I stank, I'm better than you
Oh, no, you ain't, I'mma show you, you ain't
No, you ain't, shut up

D, please tell me the reason why
You know I can't even lie, I gotta habit, I need my fix
Please assist me in this mix up, please, please
Okay, slow down, start from the beginning

Well, Del, I know you been peeping game and how it unfold
You understand how this dumb old record industry
Pimp artists for platinum
They don't want gold, so continue

Well, we the listeners feel
That this shit is really outta bounds
How that sound? They think we sheep
And put out the weakest mothersuckers with a beat

I smell, I peep, okay, I'm findin' for the crack
You need to bring it back
It's good as done, stick your nose in this
No, Holmes, go ahead, get a bigger whiff
Damn, that's ridiculous

What kind is that? I call it primal rap
Take the funk then apply it to tracks
Not like these hip hop versions of Spinal Tap
They caricatures, beware of the curse, what curse?

Man you know the spell that they put you under
You won't be able to smell, it's sorta like sportin' a halo in hell
Feelin' out of place and your halo melt
You can cop some of this while they on sale

Directly from me, not Rapidshare links
Funk is everywhere but this is a rare thing
Okay, that's what's up, I'm 'bout to tell fools

Nobody do it like Del do
What's that?
Nobody do it like Del do
Nobody do it like Del do
I need a hearing aid

Nobody do it like Del do
I need a hearing aid
Nobody do it like Del do
I need a hearing aid

Nobody do it like Del do
I need a hearing aid
Nobody do it like Del do
I need a hearing aid

Nobody do it like Del do
What you say?
What you say?

I'm so tight, I'm so tight
I'm so tight, I'm so tight
I'm smellin' myself

I'm so tight, I'm so tight
I'm so tight
You're smellin' yourself

I get down so far that I'm musty and funky
And that's good luck that'll come my way
So don't trip while I take a whiff and get
High off my own supply

Oops, I went against rule number one
But if I'm the dope in question I know
When to measure out the accurate dosage of flows
To kick so none of these posers get their chosen pick

I walk around with a odor and scent
Let the funk ferment, so burn the incense
But it doesn't matter if you can't stand it
Funk spread all over the planet expanding

Make the globe move 'cause you know you gotta hustle
Life is too funky to fake it, hustle
Gotta put twice the effort just to make it, hustle
People want the real, no imitation

And most you cats is mediocre
Your raps be insulting the culture
And where do we go from here?

Follow your nose because the nose always knows
Follow your nose because the nose always knows
Follow your nose because the nose always knows
