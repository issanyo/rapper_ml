[Hook]
I drop them beans in my lean
Beans in my lean, beans in my lean
And don’t forget the green
I’m off them beans and lean
Beans and lean, beans and lean
I’m rolling up codeine
I drop them beans in my lean
Beans in my lean, beans in  my lean
And don’t forget that green
I’m off them beans and lean
Beans and lean, beans and lean
I’m rolling up codeine

[Verse 1]
Okay, them Benz gon’ make me show out
That lean gon’ make her go down
You know I bring that dough out every time I go out
You do what you know how, I do what I want now
Started up with deuces, I’m pourin’ up a fo’ now
Niggas wanna act up ‘cause I got my sack up
Three-five in my backwoods, I can smoke it backwards
Lookin’ for me after, I’m high up like a raptor
Pop so many m&m’s, just call me Marshall Mathers
I don’t fuck with rappers man, ‘cause all these niggas actors
Get the money, that’s the only way to get back at ‘em
Fuck with niggas talkin’ ‘bout if it ain’t ‘bout the cheddar
Drop a bean up in my lean, ain’t nothing really matter

[Hook]
I drop them beans in my lean
Beans in my lean, beans in my lean
And don’t forget the green
I’m off them beans and lean
Beans and lean, beans and lean
I’m rolling up codeine
I drop them beans in my lean
Beans in my lean, beans in  my lean
And don’t forget that green
I’m off them beans and lean
Beans and lean, beans and lean
I’m rolling up codeine

[Verse 2]
Okay, I can’t forget the green, all I smoke is loud now
Can’t forget the team, smoking out the pound  now
Weed so strong it can break a whole crowd down
Feelin' like the king and I’m looking for my crown now
Dancin’ like a stripper, she prayin’ I’m  gon’ tip her
I’m smokin’ Jack The Ripper AKA the killer
Rollin’ on a hitter AKA a flipper
Codeine in my livers so she hopin’ I’mma slip up
Hopin’ she can trick me to the room ‘cause it’s a stick up
If she hit this lick then she can pay her scholarship up
All she gotta do is open up and eat this dick up
Sip that lean and take a downer, pop a bean and get up

[Hook]
I drop them beans in my lean
Beans in my lean, beans in my lean
And don’t forget the green
I’m off them beans and lean
Beans and lean, beans and lean
I’m rolling up codeine
I drop them beans in my lean
Beans in my lean, beans in  my lean
And don’t forget that green
I’m off them beans and lean
Beans and lean, beans and lean
I’m rolling up codeine
