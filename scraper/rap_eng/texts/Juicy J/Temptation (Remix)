[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin', turn this into somethin'
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin', turn this into somethin'
And we ain't tripping on the summer 'cause the stars out
Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin', turn this into somethin'
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin', turn this into somethin'
And we ain't tripping on the summer 'cause the stars out
Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin'

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
See Young Krizzle, what you know about me?
Money come and it go but it's all I see
Land in the cut with a bitch that suck
So much she need pads on her knees
Cadillac, rims on wild with the boat to match
Tell a motherfucker what you know 'bout that
Old school whip with the grain and dash, popping tags
Back again, one more time
Got to have it down the stairs
But she hike it up, I get the pussy like she throwing passes
Jerry Rice on that hoe
Turn it down and spike it up though
Beat the monkey up till it's sore
Soon as I hit the do' she got low
'Cause she know

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin', turn this into somethin'
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin', turn this into somethin'
And we ain't tripping on the summer 'cause the stars out
Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin', turn this into somethin'
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin', turn this into somethin'
And we ain't tripping on the summer 'cause the stars out
Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin'

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I'm forever balling, nigga, all about my pockets
I got too much money in my hands, I need a lot of wallets
My conversation money and I'm never talkin' cheap
What you made in a year, I blew in a week
Louie V on my clothes, Bugatti for my folks
Fast life, codeine fiend, everything slow
If I was you, nigga I'd prob'bly hate me too
I'm shopping for a new crib while you making due
Racking up these paper cuts from stacking all this paper up
Money don't bend, ends won't end, Juicy J don't give a fuck
I stay high as hell, homie it's the only way
Rolls Royce all white, call that bitch Labor Day

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin', turn this into somethin'
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin', turn this into somethin'
And we ain't tripping on the summer 'cause the stars out
Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin', turn this into somethin'
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin', turn this into somethin'
And we ain't tripping on the summer 'cause the stars out
Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin'

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Big ass rims, bad ass bitches
Baby pour some liquor, dawg roll up a Swisher
I think she feeling me, mayne, hypnotized by my pimping
When I talk bitches listen, d-d-diamonds be glistenin'
So many colors in my chain, man it looks like a prism
Bring a freak out any girl, turn a nun to a Christian
I spit this izm, now she tricking
On the strip, getting money

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin', turn this into somethin'
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin', turn this into somethin'
And we ain't tripping on the summer 'cause the stars out
Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin', turn this into somethin'
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin', turn this into somethin'
And we ain't tripping on the summer 'cause the stars out
Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out
Yeah, I'm tryna turn this into somethin'
