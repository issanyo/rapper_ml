Smith and Wesson, Smith and Wesson
You don't wanna fuck with, fuck with me
You don't wanna fuck with, fuck with me

Smith and Wesson, Smith and Wesson
You don't wanna fuck with, fuck with me
You don't wanna fuck with, fuck with me

[Verse 1]
I see some wild ass young niggas on that bacon
Broke like a motherfucker ain't fakin'
Glock in his hand and he there for robbin'
Any motherfucker in the hood is starvin'
Niggas riding clean and he wanna do that
No way they get it but a gun and a mask
Baby Mama trippin', nigga broke bills due
Don't test a young nigga cause he will kill you

[Hook]
Smith and Wesson, Smith and Wesson
You don't wanna fuck with, fuck with me
You don't wanna fuck with, fuck with me

Smith and Wesson, Smith and Wesson
You don't wanna fuck with, fuck with me
You don't wanna fuck with, fuck with me

[Verse 2]
Many young niggas be acting brand new
Don't know what to do but they feel they have to
Join any gang, get a couple of tattoo's
Try to get some rank and they just may blast you
Poppin' at a nigga and you hit the wrong fool
Bullet to the head, kill at the high school
Get your life together, young nigga it's 2:10
'Fore somebody kick the fucking doors in

[Hook]
Smith and Wesson, Smith and Wesson
You don't wanna fuck with, fuck with me
You don't wanna fuck with, fuck with me

Smith and Wesson, Smith and Wesson
You don't wanna fuck with, fuck with me
You don't wanna fuck with, fuck with me
