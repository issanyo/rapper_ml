I can't trust you hoes, busy gettin money
Thats why I been on the low, can't get nothin from me
I swear I can't trust you hoes, busy gettin money
I swear I been on the low, can't get nothin from me

Juicy J, verse 1
I'm Juicy fucking J, ain't no way, I got time to lay
With no bitches, money to be counted every fucking day
Bitch get out my face with that Rah Rah, your breath fucking stank
Iâ€™m loud as fuck cause that shit you talking don't be adding up
Hoe, you suck my dick to my drawers, I had to throw em away
Yeah hoe
You see me balling on niggas and you thinking you should get paid
Hell no
I built my business from the ground up, you been a thotty for twelve months
I made a million in thirty days, I make a living fucking commas up
I can't trust these hoes, and I can't trust these women
You already know, it's money over bitches
Get the bag bag bag, bitch I brag brag brag
Gucci tag, Louis swag, diamond chain, diamond rings, bitch you mad mad mad

YKOM, verse 2
It's like I can't trust you hoes, that straight up and down like a button up
Don't hit my line about linking up, I'm bout the money, ain't no thinking up
Cause she wanna act like a weasel, come through and speed through, that shit be see through
She pulling them stunts like Knievel, and most of these bitches be evil
Cause she get the perfect disguise and look at my face and lie "like I need you"
And that bitch a fucking disgrace, I need me a case and hella that weed too
And thats just the shit that I come up with, and she be out here on that bummy shit
She fucking with these other sucka niggas, ain't no telling who she really cuffing with
I can't trust these hoes, and I can't trust these niggas
Cause they might link up on me, and they might pull that trigger
I say it's been on my mind, but that bitch getting thicker
But I have to stay on my grind, cause chasing these dimes is losing time
