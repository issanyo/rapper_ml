[Intro]
Too cold!
Juicy J
We trippy mane!
Slam, wham-bam

[Hook: Tha Joker]
Feel like I scored thirty from the V.I.P
I'm balling, pass your hoe to me
Where the bottles at? I take three
Who got the blunts? I need two for me
Triple double, triple double
I'm going in for the win, triple double
Triple double, triple double
When I'm balling out the gym - triple double

[Verse 1: Tha Joker]
I'm balling like I just won a fucking ring
I turn the V.I.P. in to TNT
I'm in my zone like it's five of me
White liquor, brown liquor, that's a robbery
These niggas think they stunting, they're pretenders
We in the club blowing on timber
Her head in my lap I call it mental
I'm about to pass her to my team member
I hit the club going for the W
I leave the club headed to the W
Riding with some hoes, down to do a porn
They talking about me right now [?]

[Hook: Tha Joker]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
We trippy mane!
Niggas starving out here, their stomachs touch their backs
And they trap, but I ain't never seen you bitches with a sack
Worry about me, Juicy J? I got them racks on top of racks on top of racks
And I make your girl friend be my next ex
I'm blowing money while you waiting on your next check
Louis down with the yellow diamonds on my neck
Catch me in a different whip and they paid for
Make money, fuck it all, that's what it's made for
Balling in the game, I ball like a pupil
Got a triple double, trying to get a quadrouple
Juicy J got old money, I call it throwback
Got some skirt from your bitch, I call up my skirt-cab, hoe

[Hook: Tha Joker]

[Verse 3: Tha Joker]
[?] that's the [?]
Disappearing tops that's a fadeaway
Don't think a nigga green because he playa mayne
I shoot from long range like Ray-Ray
Hope you like to eat meat and hit the carnival
My team with the so the waitress is a water..[?]
Ain't no [?] but she eyeing me
She trying to jump balls, need a referee
Bitch is too cold, too old
So everytime I fuck I need two hoes
Can't [?] my office because it's [?]
I'm opposite of my hoes all american

[Hook: Tha Joker]
