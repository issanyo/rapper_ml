[Intro]
I was in the club last night mane, the hoes all on me
Man that bitch ass was so big my nigga
You know what I'm sayin'
She was throwing that ass with me, tappin' that ass back mane
Shit was crazy, I'm going back tonight

[Hook]
Tap back, tap back
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet
Tap back, tap back
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet
Tap back, tap back
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet
Tap back. tap back
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet

[Verse 1]
Every time I come out, woman crowd around me
I get so much pussy, my dick need accountant
College girls, ratchet bitches
Freak hoes, model thots
I been throwing bands, and they never land
If fucking is the plan, are you ready then
Sloppy drunk, sober it up
They both fucking me, I ain't making love

[Bridge]
Can you rate that ass, and tap back
Legs up and down then you tap back
Can you throw that ass, let me catch it
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet
Tap back, tap back
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet

[Hook]
Tap back, tap back
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet
Tap back, tap back
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet
Tap back, tap back
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet
Tap back. tap back
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet

[Verse 2]
They like the way I tap it then I bounce
I can tap yours any time I want
You know I got a girl that let me fuck any girl I want
Hot sex in the Phantom, turn your ass into a ghost
Suck me off, I stroke pussy like guitars
I got 3 chicks with me, and they all tipsy
30 minutes later they kissin', 30 minutes more that they going in
You know I'ma freak, Juicy make it rain
Sippin' California, dead Presidents, somebody call a coroner

[Bridge]
Can you rate that ass, and tap back (TAP BACK!)
Legs up and down then you tap back (TAP BACK!)
Can you throw that ass, let me catch it (LET'S GO!)
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet
Tap back, tap back
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet

[Hook]
Tap back, tap back
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet
Tap back, tap back
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet
Tap back, tap back
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet
Tap back. tap back

[Outro]
Every time she dance nasty
Make me wanna spend all my money on her mane
That's my bitch
I love when you ratchet, I love when you ratchet

[Sample]
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times

(TAP BACK!)
