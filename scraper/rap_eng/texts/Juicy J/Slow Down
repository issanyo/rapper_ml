We had no
(diamond in the back)
There was no

But we was
(diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)
(diamond in the back)
We had no
(sunroof top)
But we was
(diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)
It ain't no
(diamond in the back)
It ain't no
(sunroof top)
But we be
(diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)
(diamond in the back)
There was no

But we was

Diamond in the, diamond in the, diamond in the...

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I know it' preliminary
But I see me and my visionaries
On our military taking it over...
Even if it's temporary
We can lift and carry the windy right upon our shoulders
Oh Yes the coppers they watch us, they tap us, they trace us, they lock us
But we free so what's that supposed to mean?
Bingo, no higher, them tires, that bentley on 20's is spiffy, it's done by 310 altering
I wanna get one just like it and customize it and ride it
CTA take me where I need to go
I bet its going to kill em to see me wheelin' the villain through c-h-i-c-a-g-o
And Ima pimp her right past the United Center
Western California, Kedzie when I'm traveling
This for my niggas, my homies, my partners, my players that's posted up on Madison

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
One time, two times
For my niggas thats locked up on 26 and California currently up under incarceration
I try to tell em be cool, dont be no fool
Think of your good behavior, don't get in no altercation
That way we can chill and get ill in a brand new set of wheels as soon as you post bond
And thats for Muelers, two for each of us
That's like a watch a wrist so that we can tell time on both arms
Thank God for this gift I got that I have
We went from Aldi's bags and boxes up to Dominics
Pockets full of brown dollar bills
I got skills but some Jordans could sure build up my confidence
So I can strut, stop, pivot lean, side to side
And gracefully transmit it from hood to hood, block to block, ride to ride!

There is no

But we be

Even without no
(diamond in the back)
Or no

We be
(diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)
If you ain't got no
(diamond in the back)
Or no
(sunroof top)
You can be

Diamond in the, diamond in the, diamond in the...
Gangsta!
West Side!
