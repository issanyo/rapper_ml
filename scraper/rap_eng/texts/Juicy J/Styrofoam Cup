[Hook: Billy Wes]
I got my Styrofoam cup
Full of purple stuff
And a huge bag of beans
And a whole lot of weed

I got my Styrofoam cup (Yeah no more stressing)
Full of purple stuff (But we gon' make it)
And a huge bag of beans (No more stressing)
And a whole lot of weed (Gon' make it)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
These niggas stressin' early
Tryna feed their family
Selling dope and gambling
Robbing, snatching purses
When ain't no food coming off my plate
All the motherfucking bills is late
So I stay high almost everyday
Tryna make a little [?]
I can stand my own too If I gotta get my gun
If I gotta get my mask, If I gotta get them funds
I will do it, rob you
Is that you? Take that tool
Even though we was, was cool
Yeah my nigga [?]

[Hook: Billy Wes]
I got my Styrofoam cup
Full of purple stuff
And a huge bag of beans
And a whole lot of weed

I got my Styrofoam cup (Yeah no more stressing)
Full of purple stuff (But we gon' make it)
And a huge bag of beans (No more stressing)
And a whole lot of weed (Gon' make it)

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
We gon' make it, niggas out here struggling
Trying to work jobs that'll pay no money
But it's all good, hustlers keep a game plan
On the corner with the crack in they hand
Gotta feed all of your kids, I see the pressure my nigg
Child support ain't no joke, I see you spending again
Buying up all the kush, drinking up all the vodka
So many bills I do, make you wanna holler

I got my Styrofoam cup
Full of purple stuff

I got my Styrofoam cup (Yeah no more stressing)
Full of purple stuff (But we gon' make it)
And a huge bag of beans (No more stressing)
And a whole lot of weed (Gon' make it)

[Verse 3: Mac Pooh]
Ain't had enough, [?] 32 ounce
Pour a 4 in that bitch, this my new spouse
Pop 3 rolls [?]
Hydro got my back when I'm moving slow
No more stress, big boy walk
I'ma make it, I see you niggas gon' flop
Wassup Juicy J, we gon' make it wait
V-Slash, Project Pat, celebrate

[Hook: Billy Wes]
I got my Styrofoam cup

And a whole lot of weed (Gon' make it)
