[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, tell me that some more

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I ain't gotta fuck yo girl I got my own girl
I ain't gotta smoke your weed, I got my own drugs
I ain't gotta drink your drink, I got my own drugs
I ain't gotta pop your pills, I got my own drugs

[Bridge: 2 Chainz]
I walk in the party with my own drugs
Got my girl on the molly with her home girl
I really ain't stressin, I ain't even stressin
I really ain't stressin, I ain't even stressin
I ain't gotta fuck your bitch, I got my own girl
I ain't gotta smoke you weed, I got my own drugs
I really ain't stressin, I ain't even stressin
I really ain't stressin, I ain't even stressin

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Why you stressin me God keep em blessing me
I know how to make money, baby this the recipe
Your pussy get rest to peace, especially murder scene
Hit it from the back, she like hercules, hercules (tell em)
Started from a pot, then I took over the spot
Then I took over the plot, then I took over hip hop
Then I started geekin, then I started tweekin
Then I started reachin, then I stop speakin
Finished Monday, started on the weekend
Gas in my car, I got gas in my car
You can smell it when I'm passin your car
It's the last of the raw, all you need is a straw
And when I ain't feelin good, all I need is a mall
Show-n-off ugh
Your pockets on doughnuts, (yeah)
Got my posse out in broad day
Been up all night, it's been a long day
I'm trying to get higher fuckin up my phonshway

[Hook]
I ain't gotta fuck yo girl I got my own girl

I ain't gotta pop your pills, I got my own drugs

[Bridge]
I walk in the party with my own drugs
Got my girl on the molly with her home girl

I ain't gotta smoke you weed, I got my own drugs
I really ain't stressin, I ain't even stressin
I really ain't stressin, I ain't even stressin

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Styrofoam cups got flying spirt
Double cup full of Ms. Buttersworth
Brown skin bitch in a tennis skirt
With some rolling papers, full of purp
Couple of bad hoes in a penthouse suite
Ya'll broke niggas ain't in my league
I swear this game been good to me
I'm a veteran in this game, why would I leave?
Real niggas, that's all I see, Pimp C, RIP
I'm up all night like fuck some sleep
Push start button like fuck the key
Your boys too broke can't fuck with me
My hoes to fine can't fuck for free
Ya'll niggas out here savin hoes
I'm a start callin ya niggas justice league

[Verse 3: Cap1]
I'm on codeine, I'm a a dope fiend
Got molly world for that party girl
Exctasy, she want the best of me
Turn her out she a naughty girl
Your bitch choose my girl like
I ain't gotta speak my wife getter
Lickin on my like an optimo
Get a boy a Sprite and now pour bitch
450 for a zip of strong, cold name, gas money
Magic city, cuttin up, bitch shakin their ass for me
Fuck the bitch in my back seat
If she hit the window, she a crash dummy
I'm a dope boy to get fast money
And we stand our man the most ass for me I'm gone

[Hook]
