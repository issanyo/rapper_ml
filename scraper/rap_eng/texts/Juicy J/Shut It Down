VERSE 1 (D’AFRCAN)
Yea, mobbin in my section with my posse
Weed and liquor flowing through my body
We the livest niggas at the party
WE THE LIVEST NIGGAS AT THE PARTY!
Still I’m scoping man I see them haters plotting
You should take a nap I know that hating is exhausting
RIP the club we put that bitch inside a coffin
Walk in turn the muthafucking spot into a mosh pit
Me and my niggas

HOOK
We don’t have to say much
You already know when we show up

FUCK THIS SHIT UP!
Shut this bitch down

VERSE 2 (JUICY J)
VIP is where you find me at
Higher than the seas on my private jet
4 door lambo, I’m buying that
I’m mad cause them bitches ain’t designed it yet
I’m smoking on loud, tell 'em bitches be quiet
If a nigga keep hating, he gon' make me start a riot
Could have bought a house but I spent it on a ride
And if I get any higher, I’ma really start flying
Tell me what you know about that Taylor Gang shit
We be poppin champagne just to pour it on a bitch

HOOK
We don’t have to say much
You already know when we show up
We gon fuck this shit up
FUCK THIS SHIT UP!
Shut this bitch down
SHUT THIS BITCH DOWN!
Me and my niggas!
