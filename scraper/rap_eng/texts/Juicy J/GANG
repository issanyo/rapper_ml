(Hook: Yamine)
I keep a low no profile
Low no profile
Low,to low low
A low no profile
My gang, my gang, welcome to my gang (ho)

(Verse 1: Yamine)
You know what I do when I end up in debt
See a blue flag hangin' out I'd shoot you in the chest
You wanna talk streets then I'll put you in check
From EAST ATL so I'll have my niggas do the rest
You wanna be dawg
I'd have yo blood all up on the wall
You wanna have flaws
Fuck you whole gang, I'll end you all
I run a check
Go call a hit
I put music in my Dash bag
Everyday is a gun play
So go on Instagram ad hashtag that
Yellow rabbits (yeah hoe)
Red bandits (yeah hoe)
I'm so fly I'm still talkin' (yeah hoe)
I've been, doin' this for years
Since 6 I am doing this ain't no trash nigga!

(Hook: Yamine)
I keep a low no profile
Low no profile
Low,to low low
A low no profile
My gang, my gang, welcome to my gang (ho)

(Verse 2:Yamine)
If you in a gang then you show yo gang thang
Have yo flag hangin' out in 24 flame
I'd beat a nigga ass way back in da 6th grade
Yo boy Juicy J make my lyrics go insane
If you wanna be in
Then you have to dump a nigga in a den
If you are my friend then you
Make person lose his biz
You don't know half of the stuff that be going in my mind
1st one is to make cash and don't go blind
I stopped using auto-tune cuz that's not my thang
Everybody coming to me saying nigga you are "FAKE"
Now I'm mad and I'm going to grab a cane
Now you all scared cuz you see my gang

(Hook: Yamine)
I keep a low no profile
Low no profile
Low,to low low
A low no profile
My gang, my gang, welcome to my gang (ho)

(Outro: Juicy J)
Shut the fuck up!!!!!!
