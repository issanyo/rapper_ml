[Verse 1: Pouya]
I’m back in a cycle
Feel like a psycho
Feel like I’m Michael
Yuh
Don’t look at my bread
Don’t look at my whip
Take a look at my fico yuh
I’m pacing and thinking of robbin' of a bank
With da homies I hang with
These hoes wanna make it da bank or
Da banquet
Come hang with da gang get shady
Drunk drive in a mercedes
45 on da hip daily
Screamin out fuck you pay me
I ain’t patient
I gotta OCD
Feel like I’m not controling me
Still them hoes gon fall for me
Pussy that they offer me is often not to luxury
But lemme see what dat lick read
Triple digits in the 6 speed
Think I fall in love when that bitch hit me
I might fuck around and buss her down
And buy a bentley for that
Bitch while you was fuckin with dem lames
I made my baby momma rich yuh
Baby play with my dick not my emotions
Shed so many tears I think that I can fill an ocean
We was coasting now we roller coasting
Look inside my eyes and feel the pain that you put on me
I just pray to peep that you don’t leave me lonely
Thousand bitches but they can’t do nothing for me
You my one and only
I know you need some company
So come on over
Do you love me
Do you love exposure

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Down the fuck you tryna cop my nigga look
Your drip this ain't no robbery
But my bitch is stuck up
She bad as fuck, well like whats in my cup
She [?] I'm lovin' the way she suck
Ay, she call me J, I call her bae
We ain't the [?]
