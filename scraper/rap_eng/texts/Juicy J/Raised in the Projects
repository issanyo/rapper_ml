I was raised in the projects, projects
I was raised in the projects, projects - 6x
I was raised in the

[Verse 1]
Tryin' to floss in the projects, mayne get ya jacked off
Run up on ya with the Mossberg, face smacked off
You could be the nigga on the curb, get ya crack off
Fingers on the trigger full of herb, never slack off
Same gorilla tactics over here, pocket swollen
Pretty white guts, rims big as a Samoan
Jolly Rancher colors on the whips. We be rolling
North Memphis, Dirty South, you know that I'm holding
The hood on the weight of, my nigga you stay up
Locked down now the town gettin my pay up
It's Project Pat, the haters say, "Oh no"
Hypnotize stacking money by the boat load

[Verse 2]
We still cock 'em up, rock 'em down, come up love, ride the town
Flexing out, looking good, still the same in the hood
Full of dope, full of crosses, ain't no love, ain't no losses
Niggers greed, want it all, Cut the throat, of the bosses
Got them diamonds in the teeth, in the watch, in the Range
Diamond out, neckalace, diamond out, Fendi frame
You stay sweating the police cars on bricks
Giving fake names mayne dodging all warrants
In the projects dope bodies'll get hauled off
You got twelve years old out here shooting sawed off
These big booty chickens got suckers turning necks
Project Pat, Dirty South, welcome to the projects
