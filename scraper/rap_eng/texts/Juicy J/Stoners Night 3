She rollin' weed
She rollin' weed
She rollin' weed
She rollin' weed
She rollin’ weed and she don’t even smoke

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Lookin' at my Rollie, it's about that time
Ridin' with my white girl, lettin' her snort some lines
Might have to take a picture, boy, this bitch so fine
College girl become a stripper right before your eyes
Rollin' up and skatin' in my old school Jag
Lookin' like James Bond, fried like Cheech and Chong
Bitch slide out that thong and let me tap that ass
Filled the hot tub with money, now let's take a bath
Slippers and designer robes, come here lil' bitch, it's time to roll
Gettin' high and gettin' paid is the only thing my mind on
Pinky full of diamonds, bitch these ain't no rhinestones
Stack my money to the ceiling, you gon' have to climb on

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
She rollin' weed
She rollin' weed
She rollin' weed
She rollin' weed
She rollin’ weed and she don’t even smoke

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Used to fuck with Swishers, now it's paper planes
Have lil' mama wetter than a hurricane
You not blowin' killer then stay in your lane
You niggas off track, I'm on the money train
Counter, I doze off so I can't complain
Bitch I'm just your plumber, I am not your main
I smell like I grew a pound inside my car
Ballin' out, inside my car I got a bar
Nothin' but smoke, smell the loud on my clothes
Dammit, I'm stoned
Nothin' but dope, bought a few pounds to blow
And it's that strong
I'm in my zone, can't leave them ratchets alone
You know what I'm on
Ain't goin' home, got a dog ass bitch on my bone
So...

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
She rollin' weed
She rollin' weed
She rollin' weed
She rollin' weed
She rollin’ weed and she don’t even smoke
