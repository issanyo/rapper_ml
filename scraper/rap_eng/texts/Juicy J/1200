[Hook: Belly]
I know you probly think you're ballin' in the club
I'm ballin' every day, bitch I'm ballin' all my drugs
I spend a hundred stacks just to catch a fuckin' buzz
I'm ballin' every day, bitch I'm ballin' all my drugs
I'm ballin' all my drugs, we came in here 10 stacks strong
5000, 4000, 3000, go!
I'm talkin' 500 (gone)
400 (gone)
300 (gone)
Man, I feel that loud
I'm talkin' 500 (gone)
400 (gone)
300 (gone)
1200 in a row, hey

[Verse 1: Belly]
Getting money with them city boys
Fat fucker hitting hoes like a pretty boy
I swear these bitches got me losing weight
I might have to change my name like I'm tittie boy
Touchdown, I'm in the zone
I'm so retarded, I've been gone
I go in, you been home
It goes down, syndrome
Please excuse my demeanor
You know I lean by the liter
You know I'm all about numbers
3 hoes, 2 seater
Bitch is crashing on my couch, that's extended stacks
Molly all on the tongue, she's got expensive taste
2 stacks on the weed, she drive a Chevrolet
I pull on her hair just to see if her extensions stay
Ignoramus, bitch I'm famous
Let's see how far you can make it
Never thought you'd get this faded
This shit here is different, ain't it?
Hundred stacks, worth the mess for the damn pain
What the fuck's a couple racks worth of champagne

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Niggas ain't in my tax bracket
Any number, I make it happen
Big money on big money
Lemonade and gin and tonic
Bad bitches, I've been on that
That's my car, I'm sittin' on it
I can't get out, I put the can on it
I can't get out, I put the can on it
Cuz when a nigga get rich, bitches tryna hit tricks
Angelina on Brad Pitt, vixens tryna make a flick
Yea, I smoke a lot of weed
I ain't never seen a seed
Juicy J the money mane and I come from Ten a K
All my niggas sellin' dope
All my niggas blowin' trees
Every day full 20
I don't show no favoritism
Ain't no limit to the business
Wanna go and get it
And if it ain't smokin' it ain't no far in it
