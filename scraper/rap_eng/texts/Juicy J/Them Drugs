[Pre-Chorus]
(Yeah) I just want to smoke and get high till I touch the sky
Never trust a big butt and a smile, I just can't deny
No, I never been afraid to die, I can't even lie
Got 220 on the dash, I can't even drive

[Chorus]
Where is the drugs? I need a buzz (I Need It)
Where is the drugs? I need the plug (I Need it)
Where is the drugs? I need a flood (I Need It)
Where is the drugs? I need the muddy

[Verse 1]
Wake up, smack some ass, with some head roll me up a zip
Count me up some cash, I get bread, make that money flip
Pop another bean, eat a shroom, then you take a trip
I make sure I'm high as I can be then I take a sip
Nah, you just can't see right through my window 'cause that's confidential
Nah, this ain't no rental, this shit permanent, it's presidential
I come from the wild, I'm from the jungle, you know what I've been through
I just want to smoke and get high that shit plain and simple

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want to smoke and get high till I touch the sky
Never trust a big butt and a smile, I just can't deny
No, I never been afraid to die, I can't even lie
Got 220 on the dash, I can't even drive

[Chorus]
Where is the drugs? I need a buzz (I Need It)
Where is the drugs? I need the plug (I Need It)
Where is the drugs? I need a flood (I Need It)
Where is the drugs? I need the muddy

[Bridge]
I need a trippy sack, I need another pack
I need another joint, I need some dirty pills
I need a cheap thrill, some ratchet ass heel
I need a crib with no ceilin' please
I need a slut with no feelin' please
Who can I fuck for some energy?
And bitch who suck dick for a PHD

[Verse 2]
Roll me some weed bitch, I'm presidential
Red flowers, true essential, oval office, grindin' bud
I keep America high as fuck
I'm in the woods when I smoke the blunt
Moon rocks, invadin' my lungs, I'm the King like King LeBron
Blowin' gas like Chevron

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want to smoke and get high till I touch the sky
Never trust a big butt and a smile, I just can't deny
No, I never been afraid to die, I can't even lie
Got 220 on the dash, I can't even drive

[Chorus]
Where is the drugs? I need a buzz (I need it)
Where is the drugs? I need the plug (Yea)
Where is the drugs? I need a flood (I Need it)
Where is the drugs? I need the mud

[Outro: Jay-Z Interview]
The most beautiful things are not these objects. The most beautiful things are inside. The most beautiful things are the friendships I have. I have really like golden friendships, but you know most people don't have. You can have all the watches and paintings in the world, you don't have a friend. Friends, like I have, the friendships I've acquired and the compassion, the person I've become, like that's what this chapter is...
