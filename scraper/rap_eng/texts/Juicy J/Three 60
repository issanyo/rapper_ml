[Verse 1: Currensy]
My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
Got them bitches wana fuck
Got them haters tryna fuck with me
Yeah, they so persistent with their ignorance
Consistent with this shit I get a little bit more meticulous
Descriptive when I spit that shit, nigga, we really live it
This jet is not fictitious
Ask your bitch ‘cause she’s been in it
Impressed, way high, I’m dressed
And this ain’t shit, B, I’m just chillin’
I’m never stressed, never let ‘em see me sweat
Askin’ who designed my sweats
Examine me like I’m an exhibit
If I grew it, how’d I do it?
How much was it, where’d I get it?
It’s sickening but I’m not trippin’, love, I know how to fix ‘em
Broke niggas keep whinin’ so I cop more diamonds

[Bridge: Currensy]
All my cars got leather and wood
All my hoes is nines and dimes
All my clothes they smell like good
All my days I’m gon’ be high
All my nights I’m lookin’ for the best time I can find
Sleepin’ when it’s all over even though a life’ll never die
All my cars got leather and wood
All my hoes is nines and dimes
All my clothes they smell like good
All my days I’m gon’ be high
All my nights I’m lookin’ for the best time I can find
Sleep when it’s all over even though a life’ll never die

[Hook]
My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Juicy J pimp shit hard on a bitch
Took the drawers off a bitch
Backstage at the show, go two or three hoes
Let ‘em slob on my dick
Take a look at my wrist
You can tell I’m paid
Rich nigga shit, I bet your bitch’ll give me head on stage
Maybach outside – still get head while I drive
Nigga so high, if I fall off, I’m still gon’ land in the sky
Got lean in my cup, a room full of sluts, they all gon’ fuck
A girl named Holly, gone off that Molly
She gon’ wake up with a mouth full of nuts
Curren$y Hot Spitta and Juicy J
Double-cup full of that UGK
Bitch I shine like a UV ray
And I get head like a new toupee
Scared money don’t make no money
I’ll make your hoe open my door for me
I copped a phantom, all black
I’m in the back with a snow bunny
Ferrari faster than the Roadrunner
I bought that bitch with my show money
Damn right, nigga, I pay cash
Yeah, hoe, I don’t owe nothin’
I’m feelin’ like Superman
I’m smokin’ on Kryptonite
I’m livin’ that trippy life
Damn right, nigga, we don’t miss a night
