[Intro]
One minute nigga
I'm everywhere
I like to do this shit man, I can't help it

[Hook]
One minute niggas is real, next minute niggas is fake
One minute niggas is lovin' you, next minute niggas is hatin'
One minute nigga I'm tippin', next minute nigga I'm fuckin'
One minute nigga I'm trappin', next minute nigga I'm hustlin'
One minute I'm in a Chevy, next minute I'm in a foreign
One minute I'm the hood, next minute nigga I'm tourin'
One minute I'm blowing loud, next minute I'm pouring drank
One minute I'm on the stage, next minute I'm at the bank

[Verse 1]
One minute she want a molly, next minute she want a cup
One minute she want to party, next minute she want to fuck
I'm tired of helpin' all these niggas so they gotta figure it out
One minute I might be diggin' her, next minute kicking her out
One minute you be the man, next minute you be a fan
One minute you on the stage, next minute you in the stands
One minute you counting bags, next minute you in a Jag
One minute you got a plan, next minute you in the can
Yeah, one minute you fuckin' groupies, next minute you look like Pookie
You cannot trust all these niggas cause most of these niggas is fluky
One minute you have 'em out, next minute they run in your house
One minute you wylin' out, next minute you in a drought

[Hook]
One minute niggas is real, next minute niggas is fake
One minute niggas is lovin' you, next minute niggas is hatin'
One minute nigga I'm tippin', next minute nigga I'm fuckin'
One minute nigga I'm trappin', next minute nigga I'm hustlin'
One minute I'm in a Chevy, next minute I'm in a foreign
One minute I'm the hood, next minute nigga I'm tourin'
One minute I'm blowing loud, next minute I'm pouring drank
One minute I'm on the stage, next minute I'm at the bank

[Verse 2]
One minute they say you the best, next minute you need a vest
One minute niggas gon' hate, my nigga that's only a test
One minute they say you got it, next minute they say you average
When you stop gettin' that money them niggas don't care shit about ya
One minute you gotta get it, next minute you gotta stop
One minute they on the block, next minute they callin' the cops
One minute I get 'em in, next minute I get 'em gone
One minute niggas your friends, next minute they up in the chrome
One minute you getting money, next minute niggas is bummy
One minute niggas is thinkin', next minute niggas is dummies
One minute niggas is jackin', next minute niggas is lackin'
Remember to never be slackin' my nigga, whenever it's crackin'

[Hook]
One minute niggas is real, next minute niggas is fake
One minute niggas is lovin' you, next minute niggas is hatin'
One minute nigga I'm tippin', next minute nigga I'm fuckin'
One minute nigga I'm trappin', next minute nigga I'm hustlin'
One minute I'm in a Chevy, next minute I'm in a foreign
One minute I'm the hood, next minute nigga I'm tourin'
One minute I'm blowing loud, next minute I'm pouring drank
One minute I'm on the stage, next minute I'm at the bank
