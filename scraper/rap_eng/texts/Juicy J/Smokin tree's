Bet you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though

Cut those cameras on cause my camos on
And my niggas backin' me riding around town
With a big old bag of weed
Taylor Gang, we ain't in your faculty
Me and Snoop Dogg, we created a masterpiece
Smoke all day and I'm makin' this cash, and we
Bout it bout it like Master P
Go hard, stack ya cheese, roll a joint, pass the trees
TGOD, he's the OG, real G shit what it has to be
My real nigga gon' pop tags for me
Fake niggas gon' get bags for me
Say you just wanna shake hands with me?
Same fuck niggas used to laugh at me
Now I'm riding around town in the car that you can't even pronounce
And you can't go fast as me
Smoking marijuana, and she know that I'm a player
So she wanna come up here and spend this cash on me
That pimp shit come naturally
That fuck shit is whack to me
My kush grown organically
My ballin' is actually

Bet you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though fo' sho'

You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on

Let me turn you on and turn you out
To make you feel like you really wanna feel
For real, sho will, nigga I got that kill
You know what I got Captain Crunch, soda pop
Light green kush cut from a bush
Mix it together, get it together
Hypo grow with the hydro flow
Smoking on some shit called I don't know
This is the shit that was caught
From my niggas on the block with a .44 Glock, oh no!
Cuttin it up, button it up
Homie don't speak at all
You might escape, you might be most likely like shark bait
I might hate, nigga you smoking that lightweight
Wrong class, featherweight, levitate
Set it straight, let me break it down for you
Clip it, zip it, let it fly
If it's good, it's gonna get you high
Drop it, stop it, that ain't the one
We don't even smoke that shit for fun!

Bet you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though fo' sho'

You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on

Yea nigga, I'm rolling up that high-grade
Chillin' on the porch, smoking like it's Friday
Every day of the week to Juicy J's a high day
Niggas think I'm Chinese cause my eyes straight
I threw up a six into a twenty ounce
Smoked a half ounce of kush, felt like twenty ounces
Fucked around and popped a molly now I'm high as fuck
Every Jacob seeing, Juicy screamin' out 'let's fuck!'
I dun popped a pill and hit the lean behind it
Where my mind? Somebody help me find it
Got a black and white bitch, they my mixed bitch
They keep my double cup full, OG in my Swisher

Bet you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though fo' sho'

You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain't smokin' what we smokin' on
