[Intro: DJ Paul]
Yeah... This a dance song for all my thugs in the club
That don't dance... Just be in the back arms folded..
Cap pulled down, Just on the cut scopin everythang
Know what I'm sayin? Three 6 Mafia, Kanye West, Project Pat, WHAT!

[Hook: DJ Paul]
I'm in the club posted up, got my arms folded
Blunt in my mouth and these haters I'm scopin'
I'm just twistin' my body from side 2 side
Twistin' my body from side 2 side
I'm in the club posted up, got my arms folded
Fitted pulled down and these haters I'm scopin'
I'm just twistin' my body from side 2 side
Twistin' my body from side 2 side

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
See ho I don't dance
In the city where I'm from I wear the pants
These bitches think they cool
I got the dick so I make the rules
I got a big ol' cock
I love a bitch with a big ol' bra
She love suckin' up cum
I think I'ma give her some

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I'm from the south side of Chi, man the hood show me love
Flippin' at the Grammys with the Michael Jackson gloves
Outfit so crazy, prolly thought I was on drugs
Kool Moe Dee glasses, man I don't give a fuck
I'm on them rims by Mali, I'm cocky as Ali
I told you mothafuckas I'd make history 'fore I leave
A&Rs used to twist their head from side to side
Now I get on TV, do whatever I decide

[Hook: DJ Paul]
I'm in the club posted up, got my arms folded
Blunt in my mouth and these haters I'm scopin'
I'm just twistin' my body from side 2 side
Twistin' my body from side 2 side
I'm in the club posted up, got my arms folded
Fitted pulled down and these haters I'm scopin'
I'm just twistin' my body from side 2 side
Twistin' my body from side 2 side

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Twistin' my body, movin to the music
Cool lil body, don't you confuse it
We can get too's it
Hands, I rules it
Lil cuz got a thang on him, he'll use it
That's cocked to the right and to the left though
Killas on blow, insane like a kepto
Maniac, Project Pat posted wit my kinfolk
Ridin' with the hood Norf-Norf to the world though

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
I thought you knew I was the mane
The D-boy off the chain
Gon' walk up to a girl tell a bitch I'm Rick James
With the diamonds in my ring
And gold point fangs
And you know I'm hood rich, means I got a little change
With my thugs from the North cause I know they got my back
Lookin' for some chickens that can work it on the track
I'm just tryna get a mil', I ain't tryna be a mack
Posted up in the club with a pocket full of crack

[Hook: DJ Paul]
I'm in the club posted up, got my arms folded
Blunt in my mouth and these haters I'm scopin'
I'm just twistin' my body from side 2 side
Twistin' my body from side 2 side
I'm in the club posted up, got my arms folded
Fitted pulled down and these haters I'm scopin'
I'm just twistin' my body from side 2 side
Twistin' my body from side 2 side
