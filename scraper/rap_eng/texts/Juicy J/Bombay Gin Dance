[Verse]
You must got Nikes on your lip the way you run your mouth
My nigga Juicy J is livin' what you rap about
I like it in the trunk of my Maybach Benz
Make you disappear faster than you clap your hand
All these niggas mad, all these hoes moist
Now I'm getting my dick sucked in my Rolls Royce
Take a full ride, I'm on my high horse
Dead man Phantom, suicide doors
Rich nigga' shit, I don't deal with rappers
I made my first million when you were still in Pampers
Ride through my whole hood like "what's up?"
In my Juicy J voice: SHUT THE FUCK UP!!

[Hook]
These niggas' just be talkin'
Don't know what they talkin' bout
I think they just like talkin' just because they got a mouth
I'mma put some' in their mouth that's gon' cut that talking out
Put them guns in they mouth like "what that shit you talkin bout'?"
