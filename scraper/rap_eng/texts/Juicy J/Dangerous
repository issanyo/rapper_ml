[Intro: Juicy J & Charles Manson]
Man these streets are dangerous, mane. Better go get your gun license while you can. Got niggas killin' niggas, cops killin' niggas, neighbors killin' niggas, domestic violence, that shit crazy
"Remorse for what? You people have done everything in the world to me, doesn't that give me equal right? I can do anything I want to you people, at anytime I want to because that's what you've done to me. If you spit in my face and smack me in the mouth and throw me in solitary confinement for nothing, what do you think's gonna happen when I get outta here?"

[Chorus]
The streets are dangerous, I could dead any day
That’s why I’m ridin’ with my dogs, smokin’ plenty hay
The streets are dangerous, I could dead any day
That’s why I’m ridin’ with my dogs, smokin’ plenty hay
The streets are dangerous, I could dead any day
That’s why I’m ridin’ with my dogs, smokin’ plenty hay
The shit contagious, doin’ dope and it’s killin’ me
Even though I hit the snow, is you feelin’ me?

[Verse 1]
Nigga don't know what this life like
Shit get real on the outside
Real niggas don't talk loud, bitch niggas talk loud
Goons will turn your lights out
Cops on the corner cuffin niggas up
Nigga gets touched when they slip up
You ain’t really ‘bout that life, nigga switch up
Get your momma out the hood, nigga shit rough
Niggas can’t trust these streets, especially when they ballin’
Nigga in the hood like gods (gods), killers in the hood like zombies
High as hell, fried up, walkin' dead, shooters on the loose
Can’t tell who is who, eat a nigga’s face like food

[Chorus]
The streets are dangerous, I could dead any day
That’s why I’m ridin’ with my dogs, smokin’ plenty hay
The streets are dangerous, I could dead any day
That’s why I’m ridin’ with my dogs, smokin’ plenty hay
The streets are dangerous, I could dead any day
That’s why I’m ridin’ with my dogs, smokin’ plenty hay
The shit contagious, doin’ dope and it’s killin’ me
Even though I hit the snow, is you feelin’ me?

[Verse 2]
Damn, niggas really act like that, I know a nigga who had a plan
His sister, baby daddy posted up who got the yams
Plottin’, never thought it all the way through, anybody can be sloppy
If they do, everybody lose, they ain’t tryna run off on Poppi
Two little nigga with an extension, finally done caught them a victim
No Thanksgiving, won’t see Christmas, bodies done came up missin’
Baby daddy goin’ back to jail, sister ‘bout to call the cops
Shot his baby momma in the head, baby sittin’ there watchin’

[Chorus]
The streets are dangerous, I could dead any day
That’s why I’m ridin’ with my dogs, smokin’ plenty hay
The streets are dangerous, I could dead any day
That’s why I’m ridin’ with my dogs, smokin’ plenty hay
The streets are dangerous, I could dead any day
That’s why I’m ridin’ with my dogs, smokin’ plenty hay
The shit contagious, doin’ dope and it’s killin’ me
Even though I hit the snow, is you feelin’ me?
