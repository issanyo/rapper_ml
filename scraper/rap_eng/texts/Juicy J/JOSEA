When I sing my brother
Living on the boulevard of broken dreams

Downtown, downtown, oh yeah

Here comes the sinister girl
Selling her body for so damn cheap

Downtown, downtown, oh yeah
Downtown, downtown, oh yeah

But when I see a bad mama comming down the street
I know there ain't no playing around, on the boulevard

Downtown, downtown, oh yeah
Downtown, downtown, oh yeah

Situation is ugly, staying on the front street upto the jumpstreet
Finaly get by on this boulevard

Downtown, downtown, oh yeah
Downtown, downtown, oh yeah

People running 9 to 5, you know we've all worked hard
Tryna get by on this boulevard

Downtown, downtown, oh yeah
Downtown, downtown, oh yeah

Everybody's getting burned, tryna make his week
You know there ain't no place around like the boulevard

Downtown, downtown, oh yeah
Downtown, downtown, oh yeah

Clubpipes and cops flashing the night lights, gun fights
Both fights under the city lights

Downtown, downtown, oh yeah
Downtown, downtown, oh yeah

I see a mannequin in a cadillac, running like maniac
On the fast raft to ...

Downtown, downtown, oh yeah
Downtown, downtown, oh yeah

But when I see a bad mama going down the street
You know they're ain't no playing around on the boulevard

Downtown, downtown, oh yeah
Downtown, downtown, oh yeah
