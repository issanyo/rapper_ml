[Intro]
After five, the day ends and the night begins
After five, when one starts to [?]
After five, the cities come alive, after five

[Chorus]
Get higher baby, this that fire baby
Smoke like I'm in Haiti, in the back of my Mercedes
Get higher baby, get higher baby
Get higher baby, get higher baby
Get higher baby, this that fire baby
Smoke like I'm in Haiti, in the back of my Mercedes
Get higher baby, get higher baby
Get higher baby, this that fire baby

[Verse 1]
I'm a dog like Snoop, don't stop smoke it all like Snoop
That's all I do, if one don't cut it, I'll roll me two
I might pour me a deuce, double cup, double cross, Jesus
Big Xans, big purp, nothin' new, I'm high, no lie, that's true
That ain't no dope, baby hit this, this that tree, no Chrismas
This that kill, no witness, where did I get it from? Nigga, mind your business
Smoke all night, no limit, gas so strong, can't finish
You think you smokin' that Cali weed but this here somethin' different

[Chorus]
Get higher baby, this that fire baby
Smoke like I'm in Haiti, in the back of my Mercedes
Get higher baby, get higher baby
Get higher baby, get higher baby
Get higher baby, this that fire baby
Smoke like I'm in Haiti, in the back of my Mercedes
Get higher baby, get higher baby
Get higher baby, this that fire baby

[Verse 2]
Smokin' out pourin' up drink all in my cup
One more pill two more drinks and oh you wanna fuck
If I wasn't rappin' i'd still be rich as fuck
I'd still be smokin' out my brains, I'd still be lit as fuck
No Wraith but you lookin' at a star tho
LA, I ball like Lonzo, make a call tell 'em drop it off pronto
Roll a whole zip in a fronto, QP every week what I run through
Smokin' dope like the kind like your uncle
Shit will put you on your ass like a 1-2
Blue cheese, what I spend when I thumb through
I be on the moon on the regular
Smoke hit like a shroom, no regular
I'm so high, no service on my cellular
I ain't got to pick 'em up they mailin' 'em
Man I got so much you'd think I'm sellin' it
I just tell 'em I'm just inhalin' it
Smoke with me, get higher than you've ever been
Stoned angel like it's heaven sent

[Chorus]
Get higher baby, this that fire baby
Smoke like I'm in Haiti, in the back of my Mercedes
Get higher baby, get higher baby
Get higher baby, get higher baby
Get higher baby, this that fire baby
Smoke like I'm in Haiti, in the back of my Mercedes
Get higher baby, get higher baby
Get higher baby, this that fire baby

[Outro: 2Pac]
After five....
"Ask somebody, ask 'em, ask somebotay. This how it is. I'm the type of muthafucka that gotta have my own. I got to hustle for my own, and any man out there got to feel me. It ain't about milkin' off the next man, that's a muthafuckin' hoe. I'm a muthafuckin' pimp. I'm finna come up on my own. I'ma get my own sack. I don't wanna be nobody's worker all my life. I want my own muthafuckin' kilo. You understand me? So that's what I did. Chaka a hustler, and I'm a hustler. So everybody understand it. Ain't no one man gon' stand in one spot forever. That's a sucka! I'm a hustler, I'ma come up."
