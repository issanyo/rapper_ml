[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
There's always a bottle in the truck
Haha
Yea, man
T.G.O.D
Mafia

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
I'm always high, I'm always drunk getting too fucked up
That's why we gotta roll one up  That's why we gotta roll one up
Getting too damn stoned
I roll too much weed to smoke on my own
That's why we gotta roll one up That's why we gotta roll one up
That's why we gotta roll one up That's why we gotta roll one up
I'm always high, I'm always drunk getting too fucked up
That's why we gotta roll one up That's why we gotta roll one up
That's why we gotta roll one up That's why we gotta roll one up
Getting too damn stoned
I roll too much weed to smoke on my own
That's why we gotta roll one up That's why we gotta roll one up
That's why we gotta roll one up That's why we gotta roll one up

[Verse: Juicy J & Wiz Khalifa]
I ain't got no job, smoke weed out the jar
Most niggas gotta rob cause the
President don't fuck with us
That's why we gotta roll one up
Smoking weed with your broad
In her panties, in her bra tryna get a nigga hard
I just hit third base like a baseball game
Your bitch ridin' now she ain't yours mane
I ain't got no plans, you can bring your friends they can all join in
I got girls rollin up what they came here for
Smoke so much till I can't no more
I ain't worried about 12, I can make me a sale
Ain't gotta send it through the mail
Cause it's legal now so the plants gon' grow
OG Kush got me movin' slow
Let me hit that bong
We don't smoke that mid, only smoke that strong
If it ain't that dope, don't roll it up
And you already know what's in my cup
Finna roll a paperplane
Smoke green suicide, yeah I got my own strain
And if it ain't Green Sui', then you know it's KK
Don't fuck up my high, don't fuck up my day
I just put new rims on a oldschool car
Smoke so much that I'm in the stars
Just smoked out the new Mulsanne
I smoke more than you move them thangs
And my eyes so low, man I'm in my zone
Too damn high, man don't hit my phone
Cause you already know what I'm on
Bout to break me down a pound and roll me up a zone, nigga

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
I'm always high, I'm always drunk getting too fucked up
That's why we gotta roll one up That's why we gotta roll one up
That's why we gotta roll one up That's why we gotta roll one up
Getting too damn stoned
I roll too much weed to smoke on my own
That's why we gotta roll one up That's why we gotta roll one up
That's why we gotta roll one up That's why we gotta roll one up
I'm always high, I'm always drunk getting too fucked up
That's why we gotta roll one up That's why we gotta roll one up
That's why we gotta roll one up That's why we gotta roll one up
