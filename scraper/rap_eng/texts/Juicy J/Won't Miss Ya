[Intro]

Yeah...Still high
Still like fuck you niggas (Pussy!)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I don't play with guns but we call them toys
Totin' big straps that make a lot of noise
Talking big money, niggas better know it
Gun never on safety, I'm paranoid
I don't pull it out unless I'm 'bout to shoot
I got military guns, I got goons too
Tryna' find me, where your black suit
You think you gon' catch me slippin', you a damn fool
My bitches strapped, they keep it in they purse
Tryna' ride up on me now you ridin' a hearse
That trippy shit, I'm on another planet (mars)
Niggas hating on me I'm bullet proof, a phantom
Ridin' in a black car, ridin' with a black bag
Black gloves, black hoodie, ridin' with a black mask
I know niggas scared, so don't try to flex
A couple of bullets hit his body tore up his chest

[Hook:]
A hundred rounds, I won't miss ya ass
Put your ass on a shirt saying they miss your ass
Your family miss you, your girl miss you
The niggas miss you, Juicy J I won't miss ya
I won't miss ya (x3) Juicy J I won't miss ya (repeat)

[Instrumental]
