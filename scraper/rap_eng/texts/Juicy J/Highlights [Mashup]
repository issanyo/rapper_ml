[Hook: Ellie Goulding]
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Me, Juicy J, got too many ...
Me, Juicy J, got too many flows
Clique ballin' out, like the '98 Lakers
Pull up in a million dollar car and violate it
Fly to Cancun on Sunday, land in France on Monday
Faded at the fashion show, tryna grab a ... off the runway
I ain't even pack no clothes, nothin' but rubbers in my suitcase
Laid her on the mic, menage with my model and her roommate
And if I tip a .., we ..., it ain't no discussion
It cost to be the boss, my ..., you way out of your budget
Who you playin' with lil homie? Your life won't cost me nothin'
Juicy J so presidential, don't make me press that button

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I get a brick, you know I get it for the low
Her .. so fat, I told her drop it down low
I do a verse, you know my prices ain't low
Lil momma know I like my kisses down low

[Outro: Ellie Goulding]
