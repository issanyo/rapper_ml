[Intro]
Ayo $crim, Ruby, this shit is suicide crazy
What's in your fanny pack? What's in your fanny pack? What's in your fanny pack?
What's in your fanny pack? What's in your fanny pack? What's in your fanny pack?

[Chorus]
Hunnid bands in a fanny pack, hunnid grams in a fanny pack
And a fan in a fanny pack, weed, pills, lean jammed in a fanny pack, nigga
You look like a bitch in your fanny pack, I got a stick in my fanny pack
Turn my fanny pack to a xanny pack, now she don't know where her panties at

[Verse]
Bag reekin' out the fanny pack (fanny pack), no NFL I got a sack (got a sack)
Damn she look good from the back (from the back)
She said I look like I sell crack (hell nah)
I tell nah, I don't sell hard
She like, whatcha do then? Crack cards?
I'm like, hell nah I don't do fraud
I don't sell dope but I do trap hard
Everything I sell dope though
Keep 'em comin' back like the coke do
Fanny pack match with the coat hoe
Your drip ain't no where close to, where it 'posed to

[Chorus]
Hunnid bands in a fanny pack, hunnid grams in a fanny pack
And a fan in a fanny pack, weed, pills, lean jammed in a fanny pack, nigga
You look like a bitch in your fanny pack, I got a stick in my fanny pack
Turn my fanny pack to a xanny pack, now she don't know where her panties at

[Outro]
What's in your fanny pack? What's in your fanny pack? What's in your fanny pack?
What's in your fanny pack? What's in your fanny pack? What's in your fanny pack?
What's in your fanny pack? What's in your fanny pack? What's in your fanny pack?
What's in your fanny pack? What's in your fanny pack? What's in your fanny pack?
