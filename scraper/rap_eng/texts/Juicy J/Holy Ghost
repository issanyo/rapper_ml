(Chorus)
Who you know more blessed than me ( repeat)
Who you know more blessed than me, Jesus
12 blocks got me sweatin' like a preacher
I got that Holy Ghost ( repeat)
These chicks going fast
They acting like they ain't got the Holy Ghost (repeat)
(Hook)
Me David Hayes got the Holy Ghost like these lays
Playing the lottery like the NBA plays
Got me like the oceans sting rays
I need so more advice she got freaking jays
God is the creator but people just don't believe me
Actin like they love me but they can't even touch me
Y'all wasn't even there when I won the spelling bee
Got me mad Imma crack you like Dwight Freeny
Or sting you like a bee while I'm Muhammad Ali (yeah bro!)
(Chorus)

( HookX2)
Came from homeless now I'm rich
Like Larry Porter be saying what's yo freaking Kik
Never ever mind when the girls be like a drunk fish
I'm blessed with Lebrons
She blessed with James Bond
Every time I go to church they act like nothing's wrong(yeah bro!)
I got 4 hours
No power
Not enough before I get sour
Jestiny Vickhel Stevenson is a girl with a huge tower
No one blessed with this
While future says look at the flick of the wrist
(Chorus)
