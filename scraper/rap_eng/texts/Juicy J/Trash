[Intro]
Bitch
Why should I give a fuck?
Why should I give a fuck?

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning, took a look at my paper, I'm proud of myself
Look how far I've done made it, look how much you done fell: facts
Look at my account, you can call my accountant yourself, wealth
Forgot to pay the mortgage, million dollars sittin' on the shelf, well
I did this for Memphis, don't mean you can do it as well, hell
I've been through the struggle, I seen every level, no nigga can touch me
My juice is Egyptian, the pharaoh don't like bein' bothered, and touched by the bitches who ugly
My dick got an ego, your pussy better fit a fuckin' kilo
Spent, 20 racks in the shower, my soap worth more than your album
37 hundred dollar dinner, let the waiter write his own tip, nigga I'm livin'
Your wife on the Instagram lookin' for me, your ring on her finger
She twerkin', she suckin', she fuckin' for help
Don't look at me like you would look any nigga, look at yourself

[Pre-Hook]
Bitch rollin' up on camera, get lit
50 thousand ounces with the best weed, get lit
Niggas in the club actin' like they know me, they ain't it
When I plug in this whole shit, get lit

[Hook]
Why should I give a fuck?
Why should I give a fuck? You niggas trash
Why should I give a fuck?
Why should I give a fuck? Bitch, I'm the man
Why should I give a fuck?
Why should I give a fuck? You niggas trash
Why should I give a fuck?
Why should I give a fuck? Bitch, I'm the man

[Verse 2]
Shawty mention any rapper she dated, bitch I'll call them niggas, run a train on you
Nigga we made it, bitch you related to ratchet, your pussy eat Now & Laters
I be on these flights, and I'm tired of waitin', I just make this shit look easy
I do it in my sleep, I do it for the streets, I'm huntin', I'm sheddin'
Plenty of blood, the sweat and the tears, paid dues, no receipts
Paid the cost to be the boss, just know Juicy ain't cheap
Fuck you, pay me, more money, more problems
Nigga tried to sue me for 'bout a hundred K, told the nigga, "Whatever!"
I calculated what I got in my account, nigga I dare yah
Took my niggas to dinner, the money never divorce
Sometimes they gotta go, if they ain't lightin' the torch
My girl wanna settle down, I work too hard for this shit
I don't give a fuck about feelings, I'm rich

[Pre-Hook]
Bitch rollin' up on camera, get lit
50 thousand ounces with the best weed, get lit
Niggas in the club actin' like they know me, they ain't it
When I plug in this whole shit, get lit

[Hook]
Why should I give a fuck?
Why should I give a fuck? You niggas trash
Why should I give a fuck?
Why should I give a fuck? Bitch I'm the man
Why should I give a fuck?
Why should I give a fuck? You niggas trash
Why should I give a fuck?
Why should I give a fuck? Bitch I'm the man
