[Chorus x 8]
Gimme sum, Gimme sum
Head in here you selfish pig
(La Chat)
I'm creepin up through the cut
I got the mask upon my face
I hope no one's in sight
A robbery is about to take place
La Chat, I'm out here scopin
Lookin for victims with that cheese
Whatever to make that paper, drop it off so I can hit
A bitch that's on a come up, thinkin of a ways to make a stang
A nigga that's riding twenties, bumpin out the frame
Move, that's my mane, I take the mask off my face
I'm finna pass this fool, I know he's gonna try to holler
Cause that's just what niggas do
Then bam I got him, get in the car we goin to the tel
We get into the room he stuntin, counting all his money, yea he bail
This nigga don't know what's goin down, I'm finna go and get him
He need to drop it off with no hesitation, or I'm gonna kill him
Lay down on the bed we bump-n-grind, with nothin but sex in mind
I turn him over, get on top and surprise him with my nine
I ain't ask no questions, didn't say shit
Pull the trigger straight in the head, got away with his cheese
A smooth get away, he's naked dead in bed, yea

[Chorus x 8]
(Frayser Boy)
Now when I'm comin through
I'm kickin doors off the hinges
Please believe it, best to leave it so won't be no incidents
If you wanna like a sauna nigga I'm bringin that heat
Don't you jump us, sawed pump will sweep your ass off your feet
Lay on the fuckin ground, and don't you make a sound
Or you gonna suffer till your muthafuckin body found
Nigga this shit is real, you oughta know the deal
Don't play with me cocksucka, with this pump up in your grill
So give me cooperation, and meet all my demands
With no hesitation, put that money up in my hand
Don't be flossin, bullets tossin when I see your diamond shinin
Catch your ass up in the cut, didn't know that I was behind it
I'm makin examples up out of you niggas
Who thinkin a nigga is playin wit ya
I'm buckin you suckas, I'm bringin da ruckus
I am a muthafuckin damager, don't make no swift moves
Cause you gonna lose, I give nigga blues with hard head
So don't you fuck up, and get your ass stuck
And be somewhere up in a ditch, found dead ya bitch

[Chorus x 8]
