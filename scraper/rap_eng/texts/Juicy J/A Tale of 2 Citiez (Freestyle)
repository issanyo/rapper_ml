[Verse 1: Juicy J]
You been watching this nigga
Waiting on him to slip
You spot him at the light my nigga
In a Bentley while you creepin’ in that black Crown Vic
Pull up to the curb my nigga
Even out here balling and his family broke as shit
You think he give a fuck my nigga
Looking dead at a nigga down a barrel of your gun
Now look into his eyes my nigga
Will he die, will he live, will he beg like a bitch?
Or will he testify my nigga?
This is nigga hold it, Who gone catch it first
Somebody about to die my nigga
Niggas catchin’ grip on that gap
Make him wear chains on his neck
His face with diamonds, ice in his mouth
Fuck that nigga smile
Cause he knows that if you don’t let the choppers fly
He knows somebody gonna kill him on the other side
He knows somebody waitin’ all up in his momma house
He knows somebody
Fuck this baby momma now
It’s time for the come up
Nigga this it
Glock 19 15 in the clip
It’s up to you and God my nigga

[Hook: J. Cole & Juicy J]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
(What's the value of a thing?)
Guess not, last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Another day, another dollar
You spending on the car my nigga
Living fast, fuck the law
You ain’t worried about the cops my nigga
Your last hope you a father
You told to get a job my nigga
You just bought a new burden
The last one was hot my nigga
Everybody showing love in the streets
You a hood celebrity
Everybody knows that you’re the plug
You the nigga that they wanna be
But there’s somebody waiting on you my nigga
Don’t sleep
A black bag with a black man in a black crowd
Creepin’ on you
But you don’t give a fuck when you’re out in the streets
Dollars in the chain
Nigga you’re the hood grip
Hit the corner store for some lick
You close your eyes when you about to die
One of these niggas sound like you

[Outro]
