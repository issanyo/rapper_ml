[Hook - 2x]
I never meant, to break your heart
But you know how life go, shit happen
But you know, I still got your back
And I just, wanna tell you that

[Lil' Flip]
Many nights you waited up, but I never called back
And everytime I had a show, I would tell you to fall back
I know you think I got chicks, in every state
I know my lifestyle fast, but I'ma pump my breaks
At the beginning, everything was cool
I use to leave the studio, and pick you up from school
You was there, when I had to eat Ramon noodles
If you ain't careful, stress is what the game'll do ya
I got the world, on my shoulders
That's why I lace my girl, with a Clover
I know you worried, cause I stay in the streets ma
But don't worry, cause I roll thirty deep ma I'm good

[Lil' Flip]
At first it was restaurants, then the movies
Now you typing crazy messages, in my two-way
But it's time though, I meet a million hoes
But they ain't like you, cause they ain't got pretty toes
You know thugs, never let they feelings show
But anytime you wanna talk, just let me know
Cause I got your back, we a perfect match
It's me and you against the world, who's stopping that

[Lil' Flip]
I like to see you, with no make-up on
I like to see you with a Jacob on, now do your thang girl
If you wanna get to know me, just holla girl
Have you ever rode, in a drop top Impala girl
I could turn a good girl, into a bad girl
I got you rocking black ice, no more black pearls
I can't lie, I want your body in the worst way
I fly to Cali in the morning, I'll be back Thursday
