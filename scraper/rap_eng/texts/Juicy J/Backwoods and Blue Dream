[Chorus: Henry A-Z]
I need my backwoods and blue dream
Rippin' up my blue jeans
Always thinking' money
'cuz I only know like two things
Every time I'm sober is the only time my mood swings
Rappers up on Instagram
Just tryna flex they new chains
I been on the search for you
But damn, I know you move quick
They gon' talk about it
But I promise they won't do shit

Need my backwoods and blue dream
Rippin' up my blue jeans
Always thinking' money
'cuz I only know like two things
Every time I'm sober is the only time my mood swings
Rappers up on Instagram
Just tryna flex they new chains
I been on the search for you
But damn, I know you move quick
They gon' talk about it
But I promise they won't do shit

[Verse I: Henry A-Z]
I been so hot, they been askin' where the real you
Passin' me a dutch motha' fucka' I can't feel you
That's the shit I don't like
That's a bitch I won't wife
Backwoods and Blue Dream
I only smoke the strong type
I been feeling like I'm Wiz Khalifa in the flesh
When I wake up in the mornin' with that reefer on my breath
Buy myself a pound and I'm rollin' up a backwood
Pass it to my girl and she like
"You feeling that good?"

[Chorus: Henry A-Z]
I need my backwoods and blue dream
Rippin' up my blue jeans
Always thinking' money
'cuz I only know like two things
Every time I'm sober is the only time my mood swings

[Verse II: Juicy J]
Who got them trees (trees)
I'm talking' killer weed (weed)
I smoke a whole reef (reef)
I made it look like Christmas Eve (Eve)
I roll them loud colors (colors)
She look like Coogi sweaters (sweaters)
I got a nasty bitch (bitch)
She let me do whatever (ever)
I smoke weed by the crop (crop)
Backwoods and Blue Dream (dream)
I took my homies over seas and put 'em on new things
That's the team
Fuck you mean
You think I'm smokin' paper
Shit ain't always as it seems
