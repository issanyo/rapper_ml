[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
My name is the Scarecrow
Busters they approach, they really don't know me too well
I put in the 50 round magazine watchin' them spin as I empty the shells
Bodies are smackin the mud, bustas are constantly donating blood
I pull the sawed off out my coat pump it twice and watch each tear 'em up n' run
Oh no we do not mind my part in genocide
Oh no we do not mind committing homicide
Although the way you live is how you must die
The Scarecrow will try his best to take your life cause I know you will try to take mine
I do onto others before they do onto me
And my fingers refuse to release when I'm squeezin' the trigger on nina milli
Cause suckers be trying to take all the things you been working so hard for
But I can't hit the floor, I would rather go out in the smoke
And so I'll do what I'll have to do
I don't want to kill you yet I will fool
Before Lord Infamous take a fall I'll spray all of y'all
Aww mane, they got my back against the wall

[Hook]
Ohh that's how it is in the ghetto
(I got my back against the wall wall.. wall)
All the player haters and jealousy in the ghetto
Childrens crying, homies dying
(I got my back against the wall wall.. wall)
It's how it is in the ghetto

[Hook x4]
Pop pop pop
...another trick sucka dropped

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
A quarter after twelve, I'm still cruising down them back streets
On my job a dead body already lies on the passenger seat
Just did one for the money now I'll do two for the show and
When I drop the third body I'm gettin' ready to hit the road
I'm spendin' bloody money in the streets, cause that's all that I got From ones I've laid in the past and the new heads I just cracked
But all had to go sour when some fools tried to rush
The tables turning before my eyes, now it's me they trying to touch
I put the pedal to the mizzetal, strap my fo fifty five my seventy two
I looked up in the rear view - they still comin', them fools must got one too
Comin' up on the side, it's on, I feel they can't be real
The dead body I was transporting fell on my lap, I'm liftin' it up, they getting my steel
They started lettin 'em off, I tried to ram 'em the telephone post on the sidewalk
I got intentions to (?), I laughed as them fools take a fall
Not even no my roster for the day but my back was against da wall

[Hook]
Ohh that's how it is in the ghetto
(I got my back against the wall wall.. wall)
When a gun is to your head there's nothing left to be said in the ghetto
You better watch your back cause you might get car jacked
(I got my back against the wall wall.. wall)
That's how it is in the ghetto

[Hook x4]
Pop pop pop
...another trick sucka dropped

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
I'm that fool you don't know, I'm that one you can't see
That'll be scopin' with that gat infrared behind the trees
You gon drop to your knees, you gon' yell "Brother please!"
All the police on your force gon' be scared to witness me
When you see me in the traffic psychopathic killer addict
Kidnappin' MPD's, choppin' heads off with the hatchet
Throwin 'em in a rotty ditch while the night is filled with mist
Mystic styles 'bout the killers from the six double six

[Verse 4: Kingpin Skinny Pimp & Lil Gin]
In the alley's not a bum, just a gang creepin' low
Fourty four is the tool, pluggin hoes in the 'fro
Break the law on a slaw cop cause I'm down to blast
Paul and Infamous scrapped with the nine in they lap, plus the stash
Crunchy black at the hideout, smokin' quarter pounds
(smothered by the weed bomb)
First contestants fallin' down, flag covered up over the casket
Bitch we leavin' a dead cop surrender, no cousin, no friend, no son
Sooner or later, no matter your crews gon' drop

[Hook]
Ohh that's how it is in the ghetto
(I got my back against the wall wall.. wall)
Mothers crying cause their babies are dying in the ghetto
One time - some are straight, some from the tek
Ohh in the ghetto yeah

[Outro: Juicy J]
Yeah best believe it, Three 6 Mafia in the house for the nine five
With the all new GimiSum Family, bring it to your door fool
Till it just don't pay no mo'
We out
