Verse:
Hiya peeps, Fiya B
Running it like I'm made of gingerbread
Cringing yet? consider it
The revenge of the blerd
Discount Donald Glover on the verse
Flyer than a century bird; yes sir
No need to ask who shot first
I deserted the eagle's clip
To clip the wings of your remedial hits
And watch it plummet down; I'll never dumb it down
I'll flood the underground
Applying the pressure to become a geyser
There's a hole in the crust here, dear Liza
I'm a goofball who's too raw
Like the opposite of them blue balls
I buss it, baby...well, do songs
That makes Flex want to drop a few bombs
No cold war with this arms race
And the new clear when my arms wave
Repping M-Dub when my arms raise
But so low key, I disarm fakes
Yet the real ones know
If I wanted to be popping, I got options
Like I got a roll of bubble wrap, but the trouble packed
With the industry makes bundle wack; facts
No op-ed; got cred where I need it
Props get dropped here where the heat is
Hot head god blessed like I'm sneezing
Had a fever dream called The Monsterpiece
Now I make them in my sleep
So when I hit the booth, you never hit the snooze
Get the new GEMs May 18th
