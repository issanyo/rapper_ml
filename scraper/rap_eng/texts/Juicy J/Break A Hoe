[Verse 1: Koopsta Knicca]
Comin' straight outta North Memphis
I'm stickin' them teflons in yo phonky ass
Scandalous is that Koopsta Knicca
Makin' them stangs in a ski mask
Bustas they try me
They (?) I'm like dyin'
I'm bombin' (?) with them bullet lead
Creepin' on bitches, I'm stangin' a trick
With the infrared to yo face my nig
I fuck you up, you better to duck
I'm coocoo for them mega buck
Pockets are bigger, the Koopsta the Knicca
Just makin' a bitch make me rich
I make them stangs, I split them brains
My Filas up yo ass mane
Got you bitches like runnin'
Now that's North Memphis all on yo phonky ass
Fiendin' to make my pockets fat
... bitches who sellin' that crack
No (?) for yo (?)
The Koopsta stangin' (?) car jack
And I ain't rollin', Juice involved
I'm doggin' all you phonky hoes
If I can't hit this up my dick
Cause a bitch can't do shit but make me rich
For you niggas with some anna
I got a nine that you can't handle
(What's up fool?) *pop pop*
That's my fuckin' answer bitch
Fuck (?) trick and talk they ass off
(?) tickets to yo creds ...

[Verse 2: Koopsta Knicca]
Nigga should finna be droppin' the green
I be down with the Koopsta ain't comin' clean
I'm makin' them stangs, I'm splittin' they brains
So I'm droppin' these bitches off somethin' mane
Bitches be testin' my pimpin'
As if I really was a babbage nigga
Comin' straight outta that North for real-la
The Koopsta Knicca's a cap peeler
Though I'm not like Dracula
But bitch this time it's a psycho man
The bloody Glock mister
Blood stuck in the chest
Bitch the Koopsta the Knicca's a scandalous
Winter, spring, summer, fall oh fella
I'm creepin' in all types of weather
Knockin' these bitches like down in a ditch
Break a bitch quick, I love this shit
I break my fuckin' black back
Slangin' crack up on that dope track
My bitch tried to keep my shit
Trick so I dropped off something like that
Stupid b-izz-itch with that sh-izz-it
L-izz-ead caliber, nigga dizzy
Murder-murder, redruM, body numb in a ditch trick
With a bunch of bitches wrapped up in some plastic
They got blasted
I took yo shit and sorry bitch, you gets no fuckin' casket
Nothin' but some bullet lead stuck in your motherfuckin' head
Triple 6 engraved in red got you busta bitches scared
