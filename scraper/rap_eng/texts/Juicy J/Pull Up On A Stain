[Intro]
[Sample]

[Hook: 2x]
Pull up on a stain pull up on a stain, aye
Pull up on a stain pull up on a stain, aye
Running tryna hide then we campout, plain sight in your driveway stand out
Running tryna hide when we campout, run up on me and you run up on nem now

[Sample: Juicy J (2x)]
I can't understand why these broads be trippin
Can't stand the heat? Get outta the kitchen
Ballin in my Lex' dropped low to the ground
Just a young playa tryin'a put my bid in

[Verse 1]
Aye, I got hounds on my trail
Toughen up or get kick down eyes on the back how your boy get round
Pull up on a stain, underwear got that brown
Ruffle up your hair sit down everyone you boys my sons im proud
Got a lil clout got a lil clout, pumping up your head get loud
See how many stay when the ish go south quit running your mouth
Jump in the crowd me im just cooling all by myself mean that I prove I could
Do it no help hell in a cell, all of em years that I couldn't make bail, aye

[Hook: 2x]
Pull up on a stain pull up on a stain, aye
Pull up on a stain pull up on a stain, aye
Running tryna hide then we campout, plain sight in your driveway stand out
Running tryna hide when we campout, run up on me and you run up on nem now
