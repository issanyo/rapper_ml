(Intro)

Can't stop this money flow broke ass nigga never
Hating ass nigga

(Verse 1: Juicy J)
I got them shooters on deck, AKs with banana clips
We ain't bout that talking you get smoked like cancer sticks
My nigga only move a real niggas and goons
They don't know how to talk, they only know how to shoot
Dropped a coupla' bands, and get your top peel off
While I'm somewhere with some rich white folks playing golf
My Benz got a hole in the top like a dolphin
I'm on this codeine cause this weed got me coughin'
From Memphis Tennessee, where it ain't Ten-A-Key
Find a nigga dead in his house, he just a memory (You gone)
Niggas starving in these streets, coming for your stash
A gun plus a mask, you do the math
Still stepping on them blocks like hopscotch
Goons on deck shooting like they own a shot clock
Real nigga always counting like a stop watch
Pull them out the toaster, that turn you to a pop tart (Bitch)
Hundred bandz on a watch, bitch its my time (Bitch)
We was totin' pistols for school before Columbine (Always)
Juicy J, North Memphis Vet (You know it)
I went in and buy a Corvette and put it on my neck (You know it)
Money talk, you broke niggas is deaf (You know it)
Bitch I'm blowing on loud, and so is my check (You see it)
Fully automatics, no auto tune
I don't make no diss songs I'm leaving rappers with bullet wounds

(Hook)
Boss nigga, I be calling shots (Always)
You shaking ass niggas, be calling cops (They calling)
If I got any problems, I call them shooters (They coming)
My bitch got plenty racks, I call them hooters (They coming) (2X)

(Outro)

Real shit real spit
Get your money up nigga
Yeah
Mafia
