[Chorus] (x2)
Lil bad bitch say she wanna come through
I'm chilling at the spot you could come through
Say her friend wanna come, tell her she can come too
I'm gon' cum, you gon' cum, tell her she gon' cum too

[Verse 1]
I used to be that nigga that would take ya hoe
If she ain't sucking dick then she gon' have to go
Now I'm on some new shit I'm so fucking cold
Now I have 'em eat each other at the door
Spending all this money like this shit ain't nothing
Pull up full of drugs like I'm David Ruffin
Sprinter full of hoes they just wanna party
I told you once before these hoes for everybody
The loud burning with my niggas, them extendos with us
Came to party but we keep them triggers
Pour Patron on a thirsty hoe
You done seen a lot of shit but you ain't never been fucked on a boat

[Chorus] (x2)
Lil bad bitch say she wanna come through
I'm chilling at the spot you could come through
Say her friend wanna come, tell her she can come too
I'm gon' cum, you gon' cum, tell her she gon' cum too

[Verse 2]
I seen her with her ass all out
She said she left her man at the house
She said she going live on Facebook
She say she do her thang with a grapefruit
She trynna get with any nigga with some dough
She wanna bring a friend to enjoy the show
Well imma tell them bitches meet me at the room
Cuz I got something else for the both of you
And you gon' have to share that pussy with the crew
You talking all this shit its time to show and prove
We throwing all these hundreds on that fat ass booty
You throw that pussy at me imma alley-oop it

[Chorus] (x2)
Lil bad bitch say she wanna come through
I'm chilling at the spot you could come through
Say her friend wanna come, tell her she can come too
I'm gon' cum, you gon' cum, tell her she gon' cum too
