[Hook: Project Pat]
I'm fucking with my homies, I'm fucking with my A1's
Who got it out the mud with a thug, since day one
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my niggas who stay with me in it
No matter how hard that it was they represented*
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Patta!
I only fuck with those who only fuck with me
No love for you hoes who like to fuck for free
I was coppin' oz 800 to a g
Now I'm poppin' shows every week I'm stackin' cheese
Project on the roll like a motherfucking trucker
I'm always on the go I'm a motherfucking hustler
Never forget my lil homies in them project house
Shout out to all my lil dawgs in them FED walls
Project Patta ghetto like a bagel
Addicted to the cheddar like  junkie to the yayo
All my niggas eatin', every place I'm stackin'
Me and my homies tossed your gal
She was a fake ho
Pat I'm on the bread like last year
Nigga know the bizness
Project in this motherfucker stacking them chips, bitch
Imma ride in foreign rides and wear plenty gold
And we gon' stack plenty money and fuck plenty hoes

[Hook: Project Pat]
I'm fucking with my homies, I'm fucking with my A1's
Who got it out the mud with a thug, since day one
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my niggas who stay with me in it
No matter how hard that it was they represented
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one

[Verse 2: Juicy J](Juicy J speaking)
(You ever had niggas that was with you since the beginning
Its the same niggas who started catching feelings
When the money got real, success was knocking on your door like a police on a maintenance man tryna get in)
Shit so hard when you gotta cut a nigga off
Your friend, your ace
Ten years now, can't look at your face
Fuck what I say
You ain't the nigga I knew since the dope days, shit
Since the cold days
You just like the rest of the so called A1 niggas who turned stake soft
It's me against the world everyday mo' money  mo' hoes fuck famous
Bad bitches entertainment
Life full of changes
I'm feeling brainless
Stacking money in my bedroom
I can finally go to sleep
Feeling rich as fuck I'm never givin' up, don't fuck with me
My true A1 never turn his back
Never stole from and turned to crack
Took his dope and he turned to rack
Put Memphis on the map
Bought the game and than he sold it back
I look in the mirror he looking right back
The feeling is real, if I die on this track
If I die on this track

[Hook: Project Pat]
I'm fucking with my homies, I'm fucking with my A1's
Who got it out the mud with a thug, since day one
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my niggas who stay with me in it
No matter how hard that it was they represented
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
I'm fucking with my A1's who been there since day one
