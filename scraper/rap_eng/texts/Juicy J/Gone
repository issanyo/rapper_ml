[Intro: Juicy J]
Let's go, yeah ya'll already know what it is
Money, drugs, and bitches
All day erry day
Mhmm listen to this shit you might learn something

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
OG in my zag, hell naw we ain't smoking no Reggie
'Bout to be a dad, but got way too many kids already
Niggas stealing swag, niggas stealing ad libs
All about my cash, so I'm always talking cash shit
This gin already poured, this joint already rolled
I just got off the plane, now I'm back to getting blow
I'm not tryna play you, not tryna pay
I sell tons of swag and give rhymes away
I got cars to buy, I got flights to make
Smoke a hundred twenty five times a day
Rolling weed and counting green
On the top no in between
We the only real niggas left
Rest in peace my youngin' Tef

[Hook: Wiz and Juicy]
And we gone smoke until it's gone
Buy the bar until it's gone
And spend it all until it's gone

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Unnn, These niggas stealin swag, where they do that at?
That ain't KK in your bag, where they grew that at?
Less than 500k, where they move that at?
Not in Taylor Gang makin cake, we doin that
Think I'm doing that. New car, ain't no roof in that
Niggas boofin bad, they know ain't no truth in that
Got my weight up, now my hate up, but I'm cool with that.
Hate you when you rich, but love you when you doin bad
Now that I got cake, they say "Hey, whatchu do with that?"
Count them Louis bags, Chanel, just so my chick could brag
Dropped a 100k, just so my clique could rag
Paid in full bitch, Taylor Gang, we livin that

[Hook: Wiz and Juicy]
That's why we smoke until it's gone
And buy the bar until it's gone
And spend it all until it's gone

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
That loud all I smoke, might fuck around do blow
Stripper bitches on coke, pour gin down their throat
The more money I throw, the harder they gonna go
I can't never go broke, trust me man, I know
Still off them pills, trippy niggas for real
Neck full of them diamonds, my Sprite stay on chill
Rich til I'm killed, always spendin my mills
Before you was born, bitch I had a record deal
Smoke a whole pound of weed, like its just an eighth
Smokin all day homie, I dont need a break
Swear my lungs done seen better days
And the watch I got on cost an Escalade
I'm rollin up again, watch how high I get
And I dont need rehab, I'm not trynna quit

[Hook: Wiz and Juicy]
That's why we smoke until it's gone
And buy the bar until it's gone
And spend it all until it's gone
