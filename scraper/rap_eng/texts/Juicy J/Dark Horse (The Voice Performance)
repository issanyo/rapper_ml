[Verse 1]
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
Here you are
You better choose carefully
I-I-I'm capable of anything, of anything
And everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
Don't make me your enemy
Your enemy, your enemy

[Chorus]
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 2]
Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth
If you choose to walk away
Don't walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
It's in the palm of your hand now baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure
Before you give it up to me
It up to me
It all to me

[Chorus]
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back
