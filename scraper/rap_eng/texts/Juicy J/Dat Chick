[Verse 1: Baby E.]
Bubble booty Judy, come and pop it for your daddy
Twerk on all fours, ride smooth like a caddy
Whisper in your ear, I'ma tell you do the best
Turn you into a fiend, I'ma be a bad habit
Sex game lavish, beat it like Travis
Fucking worried 'bout bein' late like traffic
Roll a dutch [?] spark it up, pass it
Flick the ashes, put the pussy in the casket

[Hook: Baby E.]
Damn, that ass so fat
She must be from the bottom of the map
Like damn, lil mama so thick
She the best one out the whole damn click
Who the fuck is that chick
Who the fuck is that chick
She beautiful, who the fuck, who the, who the fuck is that chick
Who the fuck is that chick
Who the fuck is that chick
She beautiful, who the fuck, who the, who the fuck is that chick

[Verse 2: Baby E.]
Get you out the club, I'ma take you to the telly
Shoot it on your stomach, you can feel it in your belly
I be eating good baby, you can be my deli
Got me motivated, now we rolling like Cali
Down south women they my favorite, they the best
Cali girls love me when I'm chilling in the west
Eastcoast chicks got a bad attitude
But the party in my pocket puts 'em in a better mood

[Hook: Baby E.]
Damn, that ass so fat
She must be from the bottom of the map
Like damn, lil mama so thick
She the best one out the whole damn click
Who the fuck is that chick
Who the fuck is that chick
She beautiful, who the fuck, who the, who the fuck is that chick
Who the fuck is that chick
Who the fuck is that chick
She beautiful, who the fuck, who the, who the fuck is that chick

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Got a diva in my ear, she know I'm ready
Switchin’ lanes getting Becky at the intersection
That’s your wifey, I'm her lover
Put nothing else above her, but motherfuckin’ covers
All these diamonds in my watch, I'm killing time
Strip club, threw a dollar bill a million times
20 years time, I hit a million dimes
If you can read my mind, it's the same all the time

[Hook: Baby E.]
Damn, that ass so fat
She must be from the bottom of the map
Like damn, lil mama so thick
She the best one out the whole damn click
Who the fuck is that chick
Who the fuck is that chick
She beautiful, who the fuck, who the, who the fuck is that chick
Who the fuck is that chick
Who the fuck is that chick
She beautiful, who the fuck, who the, who the fuck is that chick

[Verse 4: Project Pat]
Waist like a [?]
[?] ass like a horse
Promethazine pussy make you wanna dose
Go to sleep in it, I'ma creep with it
Skeet nuttin' in her ass crack, I'm a freak with it
Fat ass, [?] violin
Keep my dick on the tounge, that a keep it silent
You can [?] she a dime piece
In the vid twerking ass like Miley Cyrus

[Hook: Baby E.]
Damn, that ass so fat
She must be from the bottom of the map
Like damn, lil mama so thick
She the best one out the whole damn click
Who the fuck is that chick
Who the fuck is that chick
She beautiful, who the fuck, who the, who the fuck is that chick
Who the fuck is that chick
Who the fuck is that chick
She beautiful, who the fuck, who the, who the fuck is that chick
