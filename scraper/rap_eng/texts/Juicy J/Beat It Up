[Verse 1: T. Mills]
I'm startin’ with some purple keep my eyes low
I mix it with sativa in a cyclone
Get the fuck back, cause I’m blown
I don't buy sex, cause I buy in bulk
Wait who’s that she's looking right
The kind of girl you stay fucking for a couple of nights
She got a couple grams, I got enough joints
She wants to light up in bed, I beat it up like

[Bridge]
I hold it down like a George Foreman
Overhead in the bed you know I’m performing!
Damn, million, yeah I push it to the maximum!
Like a credit card charged to the maximum!
Tulips, No flowers, two lips, two hours
And I hit that bitch with magic, I got super power
Bitches call me Travis, and groupies call me T
I just got off the phone with juicy, we got hoes in Tennessee

[Hook]
I’ll beat it up like
This beat is up like
I'll beat it up like
Give it to you girl every time
And those other guys ain't got nothing like mine
Hit it from the front to the back
And baby I ain't done, till I make you say yeah!

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
All I got is strippers and porn stars
They at me like a brand new foreign car
Let’s smoke a lot of dope
I stay in pimp mode
I got a hotel with three hoes bending over!
You know it!
With a whole lot of liquor and a party pack
They bought skittles all day, bring all the bitches back!
Don’t bring your girl around me if you don't wanna lose her
I got naked pictures of her, I might show it to you
She freak, when I’m hanging with the trippy geek nigga
So high, they drink syrup by the pitcher
Juicy J big and his bank account way bigger
Got pussy flowing like a river

[Hook: (x2)]
I’ll beat it up like
This beat is up like
I’ll beat it up like
Give it to you girl every time
And those other guys ain't got nothing like mine
Hit it from the front to the back
And baby I ain't done, till I make you say yeah!
