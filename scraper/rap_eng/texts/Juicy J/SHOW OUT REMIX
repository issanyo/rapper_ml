(RiFF RaFF VERSE)

CAPTIVATE MY STYLE CAPTIVATE MY HEART
BUT I DONE SWUNG THE LAC LIKE A WORK OF ART
THE MONA LISA RIGHT BESIDE ME WHILE THE BLUNTS BURN
I DONE WENT TO SLEEP IN FIJI WOKE UP SUN BURNT
THE LUNGS TURN AND MY BREATH CAUSE A SOLAR WIND
MY LAWN CHAIR IS VERSACE WITH THE COKE GRIN
THE GOLD GRIN THE COLD LEMON WITH THE NICE TAN
A TAN TEN BABY OIL LEFT A ASS PRINT
MY HANDPRINT PREDICATES AND A PRONOUN
AH SHIT LOOK WHO IT IS THE WHITE CHRIS BROWN
THE NIGHT OWL CROCODILE FLAVORED SUN DIAL
HOT SAUCE DIAMOND CHAIN LOOKS LIKE AN ANT PILE
