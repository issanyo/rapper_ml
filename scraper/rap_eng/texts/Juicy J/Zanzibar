[Verse 1: Belly]
Off them xannie bars, like we took a trip to Zanzibar
You should probably take your own shit, you can't handle ours
Why you phone snitchin, fuck you playing with the camera for
All my dogs rocking camouflage, on them handle bars
Hand to God, all this fuck shit I just can't applaud
We ain't standing for, paralyze them like it's manditory
Never sleep, turn the days to weeks, turn the weeks to months
I been gone, I ain't coming back, I can't even front
Damn, ain't this what the fucking people want (Ain't it?)
Ain't this what the fucking people want (Ain't it?)
I get no sleep in like at least a month
Hit it twice, and tell that bitch to leave at once

[Hook: Belly]
Off them xannie bars, like we took a trip to Zanzibar
Like we took a trip, like we took a trip to Zanzibar
Off them xannie bars, like we took a trip to Zanzibar
Like we took a trip, like we took a trip to Zanzibar

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Me xannie and molly, we ain't never breaking up
I say I need to leave them, then we end up making up
Did the after party out in New Orleans the other night
It was me, Crazy Mike, and a pair of Asian dykes
I was so fucking lit, I gave that bitch my number twice
Let the lean calm her down, she was way too fucking hype
On them xans, we was goin HAM, almost got us banned
3am, and we blowing strains, out of Pepsi cans
Took them on the bus, my nigga Belly in this bitch
Mixing bars with the keyshia, it's a party in this bitch
Got a bunch of college thots, look like barbies in this bitch
Catching babies in the face, call Maury in this bitch

[Hook: Belly]
Off them xannie bars, like we took a trip to Zanzibar
Like we took a trip, like we took a trip to Zanzibar
Off them xannie bars, like we took a trip to Zanzibar
Like we took a trip, like we took a trip to Zanzibar

[Bridge: Juicy J]
Bag full of xans, zip full of broccoli
Whole pint of lean, my kind of party
Bag full of xans, zip full of broccoli
Whole pint of lean, my kind of party
Bag full of xans, zip full of broccoli
Whole pint of lean, my kind of party
Bag full of xans, zip full of broccoli
Whole pint of lean, my kind of party

[Hook: Belly]
Off them xannie bars, like we took a trip to Zanzibar
Like we took a trip, like we took a trip to Zanzibar
Off them xannie bars, like we took a trip to Zanzibar
Like we took a trip, like we took a trip to Zanzibar

[Outro: Juicy J]
I remember when I went to Toronto, I met up with the XO niggas, man them niggas was mad. When I shook them niggas hand, them niggas gave me so many fucking pills my nigga. I had xans, I had adderall, I had motherfucking Molly in my motherfucking hand. Man had so many motherfucking drugs man. I popped half of that shit, wash that shit down with some motherfucking Bombay. We went to the motherfucking venue and turnt the fuck up, I was so turnt up, I was jumping all over the motherfucking place man. Met a groupie ass bitch. Toronto got some fine ass ho's man, no real shit man, and them motherfucking bitches would do anything my nigga, suck dick all night. So I met up with this bitch, she was finer than a motherfucker man, I need to find that bitch's number man. She might be different now
