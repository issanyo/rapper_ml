Nigga my pockets on lotto
I smoke a lot of Gelato
Nigga my pockets on lotto
I smoke a lot of Gelato
Nigga my trap house a condo
I used to live in a bando
Now I look like I just hit the lotto
I smoke a lot of Gelato

[Verse 1]
We trappin' out feelings
We hop out on bitches and Bentleys and Benzes we trappin' out
They say I'm worth like a couple of milli
That's way too low, that's a false amount
When you get up in them millions
They gettin' them feelings you might have to cross 'em out
Nowaday it ain't nothin' to talk about
Live the rest of your life in a coffin now
I used to trap on the block
That way I got me a condo
VVS cost me a lot
And my bitch is too much to handle
Niggas be in the street but they dodge us like pot holes
Talkin' like they be ridin' on some new Forgiato's
Got a mexican plug, when he ship it he wrap it up just like some taco
Told him show me some love
Extra cheese on my shit, I don't want no cilantro
My sauce is always drippin', I'm talkin' like nachos
Nigga my pockets on lotto, I'm smokin' Gelato

[Hook]
Nigga my pockets on lotto
I smoke a lot of Gelato
Nigga my pockets on lotto
I smoke a lot of Gelato
Nigga my trap house a condo
I used to live in a bando
Now I look like I just hit the lotto
I smoke a lot of Gelato

[Verse 2]
Gelato in my cone, what you smokin' on?
Nigga that ain't strong, leave that shit alone
If it ain't Gelato, just don't call my phone
Smoke one to the dome, now I'm in the zone
Take off like I'm gone like I ain't comin' home
We cannot go, Emano Emano my pockets on lotto
I level up homie
Come getcha heat, prolly gon' slide in a taho
I feel like Tony Montana
Bitch I be snappin' like cameras
You just be actin' for cameras
That's why I keep me a Canon
My pockets on auto, these bitches on lotto
I'm smokin' Gelato, I do this a lot
These bitches gon' follow the money
They know how we comin'
They see who we got in the lot
Never been worried 'bout nothin'
I know niggas bluffin' but I know that niggas gon' plot
Bitch I been livin' like Pablo, been livin' like Chapo
Before they locked 'em in a box
