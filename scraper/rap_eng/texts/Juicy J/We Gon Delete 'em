[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I put out serial killer hits, David Berkowitz
D.C. sniper, no politics
Just hollow tips
Comin' from my whole direction
I ain't the mailman, but I will send a message
Gansta shit is on a whole 'nother level shit
Wipe out your whole family, Charles Manson bitch
Milk carton missing, they put out an Amber alert
I've been the realest nigga in it since child birth
So call the police 'cause you niggas know me
I got killas from my hood and they hungry
And they paid in full, 75 racks
This year I'm laying the smackdown, Project Pat

[Hook] (x2)
I came up from the streets nigga with the street niggas
My team winning we dont accept defeat nigga
We treat haters like drums we gon beat'em
They say the wrong words we gon delete'em

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
Yeah, I'm in the booth with Juice J up in this bitch
No escaping the whip I'll get you stomped in a trap
Double cup, pink stuff, stink stuff, think tough?
If you want to bitch, pardon the strape
Pointing mine at any target I'm at
Talking like he shouldn't breathe any longer than that
Walk in Militia with me and carbon and gat
Niggas so milk til I carton the cat
Wiser now with an Einstien, four five nines
They got me with a hypnotized mind
Sippin mine purple as wine thinking my dime grind all the time
Its the time look at the time run
Rhyme looking at lines cooking to find mine
Ground drips and the shine crooked as crime
I'm on 1 2 3, eh fuck it I'll run 5
They gave me the ball straight then caused it to line drive
You haters is all late, I'm reppin the 3 6
Bronx all day, YMCMB bitch
NYC to the Tennesse bitch, you a fuck nigga blame it on the Hennesey bitch
M-Gang, ask 'bout the niggas he with, Hash, Coke, Pop Dolla$ is with me bitch
I be on the street you be on that street shit
Young Money Cash Money til I'm in a deep ditch

[Hook] (x2)
