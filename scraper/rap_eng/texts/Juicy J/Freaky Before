[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Calling up, wanna know exactly what's going on
Work all night, fall through the trap in the early morn'
She don't waste any time she getting what she want
Don't hesitate, baby relax your mind hit this KK and elevate
Kicking it with some real niggas nothing like them clones
Should be soaking up all this swag instead they going through your phone
Girl, Instagram ain't got that many likes
First she ain't smoke when I approached her now she rolling them right
And holding 'em tight, going all night, you know I'm the type
I lower the lights, and

[Chorus] (x3)
She get freaky before the bed
She getting freaky before the bed
She getting freaky before the bed

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Boo you nasty throw your legs up, I'm in my zone
Take off your dress take off your bra I'm tryna make you moan
Make yo ankles touch, my thumb in yo' pussy
Caressing your butt and tell you, how much I wanna fuck
But I like watching you, freak me before I hit that ass
Oh you, wanna share me tonight, then call your friend from Georgia Tech
Cuz I enjoy her neck, and I enjoy your breasts
And y'all can fuck me first and eat each other next
I'm so blessed, I'll enjoy the show
Weed smoke, camera open on my iPhone

[Chorus] (x3)
She get freaky before the bed
She getting freaky before the bed
She getting freaky before the bed

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Project Pat-uh, touch them toes-ayes, my lil bros-ayes(?)
Them tats, on that soft pretty skin, and a wet, pussy
I must say, make me wanna murder seen that kitty with it
Promethazine sucking titties, on her mouth I show no pity
Head fire, got them toes curled up like nappy hair
Polo is my underwear she open them legs whats up in thur
I'm going in and out and in and out
I'm trying to keep my (?)
She freaky as she need to be, showing that she fuck with me
She always sucking me

[Chorus] (x3)
She get freaky before the bed
She getting freaky before the bed
She getting freaky before the bed
