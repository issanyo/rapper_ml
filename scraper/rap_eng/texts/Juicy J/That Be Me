[Intro: Lud Foe]
Ayy
Gang, gang
YSN street nigga, Out West money bitch
Straight gang shit, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: Lud Foe]
I was down to my last, nigga I was down bad
Had two dollars in my pocket, spent it on a black mask
Bitch I hang around with robbers, don't be the victim
I couldn't work a job 'cause I'm in the system
I got my revolver, tryna catch you slippin'
I didn't even call her, I kept it pimpin'
Henny in my pimp cup, that's what I'm sippin'
You can get your shit split, nigga if you're trippin'
I got grams on the table, razor blades cut the dope
We was baggin' up the grams, twelve kicked down the door
I jumped out the window, ran through the gateway
Tried to jump the fence, tore my shirt on the black gate

[Chorus: Lud Foe]
Who that nigga with the bankroll? that be me
Who put dick up in these skank hoes? that be me
Who that nigga with that four-four? that be me
Who the police say they looking for? that be me
Who that nigga with the bankroll? that be me
Who put dick up in these skank hoes? that be me
Who that nigga with that four-four? that be me
Who the police say they looking for? that be me

[Verse 2: Lud Foe]
Someone dropped the dime on me, cruisin' with my nine on me
Don't believe the bullshit you hear, niggas lying on me
Candy coated paint wet, drippin' off my Cadillac
I hit shorty from the rear end, tried to break her back
I been trappin' all weekend, gettin' them dividends
Puttin' my motherfuckin' gun to use, broke the firing pin
Better not short a motherfuckin' dime when you're paying me
I ain't got the time for a bitch to be playing me
I be with the gangsters, I hang with the vicelords
Bloods and the crips with me, slidin' like skateboard
I was down and bad, plug fronted me, I paid for it
This bitch hit so fast, she's a dime, so I paid for it

[Chorus: Lud Foe]
Who that nigga with the bankroll? that be me
Who put dick up in these skank hoes? that be me
Who that nigga with that four-four? that be me
Who the police say they looking for? that be me
Who that nigga with the bankroll? that be me
Who put dick up in these skank hoes? that be me
Who that nigga with that four-four? that be me
Who the police say they looking for? that be me

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Who went from nothing to it all nigga? that be me
Same nigga from the start nigga, that be me
Same hood, same squad nigga, same street
To make it out that shit was hard nigga, ain't no peace
We was starvin' in the hood, it wasn't never nothin' to eat
Corner store, fifty cent bag of chips and something sweet
Grab a Swisher or a dutch, break down the roaches, roll 'em up
It's like nine in the morning on the block, we cold as fuck
Hunger pains amongst other things, gotta love the game
Feed the gang, smoke some weed and sip some shit to ease the pain
Money never made me but I can make a dollar
Ever since I can remember I've been poppin' my collar

[Chorus: Lud Foe]
Who that nigga with the bankroll? that be me
Who put dick up in these skank hoes? that be me
Who that nigga with that four-four? that be me
Who the police say they looking for? that be me
Who that nigga with the bankroll? that be me
Who put dick up in these skank hoes? that be me
Who that nigga with that four-four? that be me
Who the police say they looking for? that be me
