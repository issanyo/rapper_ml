[Hook]
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga
They be talking tough but they be scared nigga
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga
You ain't 'bout that action but that's what you saying nigga
Quarter mill and it's stacked up in the safe
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga
Blowing gas while I'm swerving in my Wraith
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga

[Verse 1]
Niggas talking sideways, don't respect the code
They looking for a handout or they coming at your throat
Thirsty hoes and these broke niggas kill me
New bitch, new whip and now they get all in their feelings
Yeah nigga know you gotta watch your homies
If they ain't happy that you eating, they ain't your homies
You niggas came up from the mud, I thought that was your nigga
He out here posting all this hating ass shit all over twitter
I done put my young niggas on 'em
They slap his ass with the pistol and put that boy in a coma
And I put that on my momma
You niggas don't want this drama
You think I'm playing little nigga, it's that way over dishonerw

[Hook]
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga
They be talking tough but they be scared nigga
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga
You ain't 'bout that action but that's what you saying nigga
Quarter mill and it's stacked up in the safe
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga
Blowing gas while I'm swerving in my Wraith
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga

[Verse 2]
Already know, most you niggas hoes, telling on the low
Won't be long 'fore you get exposed, I'll cut your throat
Shit is real, love'll get you killed, gotta keep the steel
Peep yo niggas, you can feed your niggas, they be plotting still
You a bitch, always in the mix, always talking shit
One slip, get your ass hit, catch a whole clip
Loud mouth, ain't no hiding out, they inside your house
Man down, you can't talk it out, ain't shit to talk about
Nigga, fuck you think you kidding
If I [?] your whole family come up missing
Nigga we get in your grill, ain't no dumping in no crowd
I know them something you wish, you just thinkin' out loud

[Hook]
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga
They be talking tough but they be scared nigga
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga
You ain't 'bout that action but that's what you saying nigga
Quarter mill and it's stacked up in the safe
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga
Blowing gas while I'm swerving in my Wraith
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga
