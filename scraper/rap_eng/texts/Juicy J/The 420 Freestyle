[Intro]
Smoking energy
Smoking on some energy

[Hook]
I got frenemies
Got a lot of frenemies
Got so many people tryna drain me off this energy
Tryna take a wave from a nigga
Playing with the money, pray for these niggas](6496832)

[Verse 1]
Drop a bitch at the mall, tell her buy what she want
I got a condo, I only spent a night in it once
Rappers talking sideways in their interviews
They just tryna stay on flow like a inner tube
I might drop a mixtape cuz I'm in the mood
Probably get my dick sucked, for the interlude
What you mad at a nigga for, I don't get it
Your running out of time lil homie, the clock ticking
I think I want a r&b girl tonight
A mimosa and some pussy that's a early flight
Red light special and your chick get served
Sign on the door say do not disturb

[Hook 2]
I got frenemies
Got a lot of frenemies
Got a lot people tryna drain me off this energy
Tryna take a wave from a nigga
Playing with the bread, pray for a nigga, nigga

[Verse 3]
Nigga you don’t want no problems with me
I put money on your head that’s a hobby to me
I pull up and fill the hotel lobby with freaks
Your girl sneaking out the crib just to party with me
Last night I met a thottie with a college degree
So I let her give me brain, said she smarter than me
What you mad at a nigga for, I don't get it
I could trade in my Ferrari for a hundred Honda Civic's
And get one of them bitches to, all of my bitches then
Put that shit on Twitter for ya, just to say I did it, hollup
Champagne for my guest
DJ Khalid on the speakerphone, tell em we the best

[Hook 2 x2]

[Outro until the end]
Smoking energy
Smoking on some energy
