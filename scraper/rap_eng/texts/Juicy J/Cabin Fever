[Intro]
Yeah
Yeaah
Tahaha
You niggas know its the gang or kill yourself, right?
Yeaah
Yup

[Verse 1]
Red hat black chucks black 501's on
That's your baby momma but her numbers in my iPhone
Yea I got a girl but I swear I need a newer bitch
Let her out the house and I'll be leaving here with your bitch
I'm flyin' in a different city every night
Got everything I ever wanted so this can't be life
Breaking down the weed I'm 'bout to make a plane
A hundred niggas with me all reppin' Taylor Gang

[Break]
Yeaaahahhhh bitch
Okaaayyyy
Yeaah
Yup

[Verse 2]
Lot of niggas fake but me I give these hoes faith
Feed her alcohol and leave that bitch with no taste
Out of this world need my own space
Back seat and I'm a ride until the chrome break
Big heat will turn your body to a cold case
She don't even make it rain she just throw me face
Got some niggas quick to bang like they Major Payne
Told Lil' mom I rep the gang she just say the same
Yeaaaaahhhhh bitch

[Chorus]
If you see em point em out
If you see em point em out
There's a bad bitch in here
And you see her point her out
There's a bad bitch in here
And you see her point her out

[Verse 3]
Yeeeaaahh yupp
You show up to concerts looking like a fan
I pull up in car service looking like the man
Hella reefer smoke a lot of pictures being taken
My bitch from Atlanta my weed is Jamaican
I don't talk much too many niggas hatin
Buy the boutique that's my type of conversation
I dropped a little change on these hater frames
Took her car keys and let her play Dwayne
Yeaaah...bitch

[Chorus]
If you see em point em out
If you see em point em out
There's a bad bitch in here
And you see her point her out
There's a bad bitch in here
And you see her point her out
