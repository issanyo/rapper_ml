[Intro: Juicy J + Wiz Khalifa]
Mistercap
You ready again bro?
Yeah!
TGOD Mafia
Straight out of Pittsburgh, mane
Can't smoke weed to it
Don't doubt this nigga
I don't wanna listen to it
He the truth, nigga

[Hook: Travis Scott]
At my bake sale yeah
We can't wait to bake, hell yeah
Laughin' off this drank, hell yeah
Lovin', havin' sex, hell yeah
All day, hell yeah
We've been countin' cake, hell yeah
Puffin' on this dank, hell yeah
We can't wait to bake, hell yeah

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
I've been on the phone, hell yeah
Gettin' calls from home, hell yeah
So I started up a bake sale, yeah
They know I got all the cake, hell yeah

[Verse 1: MvdS]
Smokin' on that Khaled, bitch, my weed the best
Kush and OJ, swear to God that's the key to success
Give this hoe a puff, then I need it back
Twisted of the 'Jac, man, I can see my neck
I can't feel my face, my torso, any of my limbs
Floating 'round the room, bitch, I'm high as Tiny Tim
You ain't at my waist level, boy, you barely reach my shin
Charlie Puth you in your place, guess we won't see you again
I'm on Mary Jane and Molly, that's a double date
We're going on a trip, it'll last a couple days
This all medicinal, sir, there's no need to confiscate
Pull up in a real big car, you'd think I'd need to compensate

[Hook: Travis Scott & MvdS]
At my bake sale yeah
We can't wait to bake, hell yeah
Laughin' off this drank, hell yeah
Lord for heaven's sakes, hell yeah
All day, hell yeah
We've been countin' cake, hell yeah
Puffin' on this dank, hell yeah
We can't wait to bake, hell yeah

[Verse 2: MvdS]
Baby, gimme nookie, I'll put extra in your cookie
Even bring it at your door, if you pass along your room key
I'm no rookie, I'm professional
Guaranteed exceptional
How it's post to be: Mvd posin' on a pedestal
I roll my blunts just how I like 'em, lookin' like a crack whore
If the girl still not impressed, what you think them racks for?
Knocking on that pussy, she say 'you come through the backdoor'
Bending over all night, man, you would think her back sore
Light one for my problems, another for solutions
You can jump up on this dick, but don't you dare jump to conclusions
Man, I'm always livin' green, I still partake in air pollution
We be sellin' cookies, got an order up from Lucious
At my! At my!

[Hook: Travis Scott]
At my bake sale yeah
We can't wait to bake, hell yeah
Laughin' off this drank, hell yeah
Lovin', havin' sex, hell yeah
All day, hell yeah
We've been countin' cake, hell yeah
Puffin' on this dank, hell yeah
We can't wait to bake, hell yeah


[Outro: Wiz Khalifa + Travis Scott]
Roll, roll one up
Got a J, make a plane, now we goin' up
All day, every day, we ain't roll enough
Get a pound, break it down, get them cones though
It's goin' down, goin' down
I'ma roll one up
Get a J, make a plane, now we goin' up
All day, every day, we ain't smoke enough
I'm on the K, K, stoned as fuck
At my bake sale yeah
