[Intro]
Quickly, I reach for my chicken then I roll it up
Quickly, I reach for my chicken then I roll it up
Quickly, I reach for my chicken then I roll it up
Quickly, I reach for my chicken then I roll it up

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
I felt the need for the weed
The Smo-ko-king
They say the trees
Just for me
The B, The L, The U-N-T
The B, the, the, the U
The, the, the D
Oowee
Give me shotgun
Oh please, oh please
No chicken feet
But chicken weed
Pick out the seeds
The heat is hittin' me
Many degrees, we gotta have it
Don’t want to cabbage
We hate that babbage
Life savage
We we we wanna, the Marijuana
Or we gonners
Yo man I’m gonna, go round the corner
Get right onna ah ah ah sack
I need contact I need it bad
So I can mask
Just just like that
Go crank your ‘Lac
We need to go, man
You move to slow
Take care of dat
Who got the hay, who got the hay?
Where do the stay?
Across the street
I’m goin’ crazy lookn' for the ink
I’ll take a quarter
Fill it to the border of that mac
Where Da Bud at

[Hook: Lord Infamous]
Where is the bud
Where is the bud
Where is the bud
Where is the bud
Where is the bud
Where is the bud
Where is the bud
Where is the bud
Where is the bud
We looking for the bud
Where is the bud
We looking for the bud
Where is the bud
We looking for the bud

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
They call me Lord Infamous
But you can call me Scarecrow
I need me some red hair
Chicken or some Indo
And I need a couple of quarts of something, so I can get full
We smoke off the ink
We get blowed off the ink
We get fucked up
We takin' them hard pulls
You’ll get a wiff when you sniff up in the air
We smoke bud anywhere
Yeah bitch we don’t care
Cause when we get the urge to fire up some Chronic, mane
A nigga must campaign
Clouds up in the brain
Oh, that cheefa got me hype
Oh me so hype dog
Blowin' so much bud
Fool cheefin' contacts off the fall
This shit is burnin' too quick
Fuck these little junts
Let’s strool to the store, get some cigars
Roll some Philly blunts
Damn fool ain’t shit in the sack
But some fuckin' shake
I need some more pure and I just can’t fuckin' wait, Black
Let’s go, Where da bud at
Let’s go, where da bud at
Let’s go, where da bud at, mane?

[Hook: Lord Infamous]
Where is the bud
Where is the bud
Where is the bud
Where is the bud
Where is the bud
Where is the bud
Where is the bud
Where is the bud
Where is the bud
We looking for the bud
