[Intro: Kent Jamz]
Shake that, drop it, drop it
Shake that, drop it, drop it
Shake that ass

[Verse 1: Kent Jamz]
I'm in KOD off shrooms, half a bottle of Henny
My bitch never been to Miami, she throwing my money to me
Pockets on Cee-lo, [?] her booty
She said I ain't gotta throw a dollar, my girl make her gooey
Bitch, lick your macbook screen when you see me on it
I'm in LSD off KOD, no wait
Bitch, lick your macbook screen when you see me on it
I'm in KOD off LSD, all these bitches love me

[Hook: Kent Jamz]
I'ma make a bitch pay me for a lap dance
Shake that ass, shake that ass
I'ma make a bitch pay me for a lap dance
Pop that pussy, pop that pussy
I'ma make a bitch pay me for a lap dance
Shake that ass, shake that ass
I'ma make a bitch pay me for a lap dance
Pop that pussy, pop that pussy

[Verse 2: Joon]
Now make that ass pop, like my cock, on this zip-per
She was searching for some real love, real buzz, [?]
I was on her mind like a Kangol, [?] nigga my way into a tangle
With her and a stranger and that pussy is a lion, I'm the tamer
I pull my dick out on a ho
Now can you see me, can you see me
I'll have her screaming, "It's alive!"
Franken-weenie, franken-weenie
No, I don't got no money
But at least I know one bitch up in this club that wanna fuck me
So I owe you, baby bust it open like a bag of chips
Sag a bitch, tell me can you handle it?
If I'm getting too frisky, tell me
Don't be snitching to your managers
You could see I'm on drugs so don't try to take advantage of my kindness
Cause I'll switch up on your ass like the green Avenger
Do it just like that, do it just like that
I need a [?]
Make me cum all in my pants, clean me up then take me home
Do it just like that, do it just like that
I need a [?]
Make me cum all in my pants, clean me up then take me home

[Verse 3: Sleazy]
Even at rock bottom, the 'Doz can get it poppin'
So proper we on our job, lame bitches we just crop 'em out
Or sleepless nights, 'til I get up out my daddy house
These suckers salty, I spit the game that fuck they spouse
Roll up the dodi, and watch the days breeze by
Plotting on my future, gangsta leaning in a clean ride
She give me that oral for moral support I grip them thighs
She bumping Plies, that ain't my vibe I'm about to get stoned and slide
She catching feelings now, to me that ain't no surprise
Just keep it on the low and just stay loyal like you Semper Fi
She catching feelings now, to me that ain't no surprise
Just keep it on the low and just stay loyal like you Semper Fi

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
Bitches don't play stupid, if you smell kush it's Juicy
Hundred clips, that's a movie, that's a tec and a uzi
Pull up in a Bentley coupe, missin' roof and you knew it
I pull up in that 'rari still no roof and it's foolish
I'm in Gucci not Nikes, but I still look like a check
'til I pulled up in this Lambo, you look cool in your 'vette
It's Juicy J the OG, I'm rolling rolling sticky
And all I got is [?] and model bitches with me
Dancing for tuition, get money is a mission
I'm smokin' and I'm sippin'
They thirsty, Robin Givens
I can't save a ho, no preacher like Ma$e
Screamin' fuck you pay me, with dick off in her face

[Hook]
