[Intro: Juicy J]
(Mafia, mafia... mafia, mafia...)
Once again, you do wrong, wrong will follow
That's real shit, real spit nigga, you know the business

[Hook: Juicy J]
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
What ya sayin nigga? What ya sayin nigga?
What ya sayin nigga? Naw, what ya sayin nigga?
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Yea, I tell you one time, don't play with my bread
Nigga, you do, they gon' find yo ass dead
Body in trunk, hands tied to yo legs
Tape on yo mouth, a hole in yo head
Fronted some dope, now the nigga in debt
How you gon' pay that? Nigga don't sweat
Goons on deck - you know what's next
Send 'em to yo house, now it's time to collect
Now you in a box, nigga - cause and effect
Hollow points and buckshots, all in yo neck
Told ya 'bout playin' with a nigga like that
Now yo fam gon' visit you, payin' they respects
Tell ya one time, don't play with my money
Sold all my dope, now you run around stuntin'
All in the mall, spendin' money on ya woman
Nigga must think he don't owe me nothin'
Nigga must think I forgot about mine
He pressed 'ignore' when I called his line
I'mma play it cool like everythin' fine
Catch him comin' home, lay him down with the 9

[Hook: Juicy J]
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
What ya sayin nigga? What ya sayin nigga?
What ya sayin nigga? Naw, what ya sayin nigga?
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Yo, bang bang, shoot 'em up
Memphis niggas don't give a fuck
Run up on ya in broad day
Pull them guns out, shoot ya up
Loose ya life over light green
Kill a nigga over soft white
You ain't from here, don't come here
And if you do, better walk light
Out here is a nightmare
Homicides, not Freddy Krueger
Niggas ain't got shit to lose
Shoot it out like a Western movie
The trigger ain't got no heart
The nigga behind it ain't got no love
These niggas ain't wearin' no mask
And these niggas ain't wearin' no gloves
These niggas don't fight no mo', fuck takin' the high road
Lil' homie 'bout 16, bust a gun with his eyes closed
Fuck with all that gangsta talk, know you ain't bout that life
Pull that heater on yo ass, bet you come up off that ice

[Hook: Juicy J]
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
What ya sayin nigga? What ya sayin nigga?
What ya sayin nigga? Naw, what ya sayin nigga?
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love
The trigger ain't got no heart, the nigga behind it ain't got no love

[Bridge]
(North Memphis, North Memphis
North Memphis, North Memphis...)

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Fifty shots clear this bitch out like a tornado
Two choppas who identical - call 'em Kane and Abel
Very fatal, dippin' in stash like a soup ladle
Rolled up on him, shot him in his head - busted tomato
You niggas get high on this shit, like to hold ya' nuts
Shotgun blast to ya stomach, bitch, hold ya guts
You say you gang affiliated, extra clips tough
And when the bullets get to poppin', they don't give no fucks
Money rules everything, and we got the cash
Pay yo homies one bag to blow up yo ass
Kidnap ya from ya residence, no mask no lie
F.B.I. found ya body in Project dumpster, BFI
