[Intro: Lord Infamous]
I turned against God and everything that I cared for most
Police arrived, candle light, butcher knives, bloody bedposts
I turned against God and everything that I cared for most
Police arrived, candle light, butcher knives, bloody bedposts

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Ratchet house party with the lights off
I can smell her pussy all night, dawg
All the hoes fuckin' in here, all the hoes fuckin' they friends
You better keep the lights off
Bitches in the kitchen gettin' fucked up (fucked up!)
Kissing on each other, bitch I wanna fuck (wanna fuck!)
She sucking on a bottle of Ciroc, don't stop
Got my dick standin' tall like a mailbox
She poppin', she smokin', she suckin' a dick
She owe me from Instagram, liking her pics
She DM my nigga, we taggin' that bitch
Her friend was a nine and we tussled that bitch
I'm wit my niggas, we want all the bitches (all the bitches!)
Fuck every nigga who ain't in it with us (fuck 'em!)
All the hoes comin' home with us
We gon' send them back full of nut (fill that bitch up!)

[Chorus: Juicy J]
That's the bitch from the gram
That's the bitch from the gram (that's her)
That's the bitch from the gram (know you know her)
That's the bitch from the gram (prolly fucked her)
That's the bitch from the gram (yeah)
That's the bitch from the gram (it's that bitch)
You know that she fuckin', she bustin it open, god damn
That's the bitch from the gram
That's the bitch from the gram (she freaky mane)
That's the bitch from the gram (be careful)
That's the bitch from the gram
That's the bitch from the gram
That's the bitch from the gram (I told you mane)
That's the bitch from the gram
You know that she fuckin', she bustin it open, god damn

[Outro: Juicy J]
That's the bitch from the gram
That's the bitch from the gram
That's the bitch from the gram
That's the bitch from the gram
That's the bitch from the gram
That's the bitch from the gram
That's the bitch from the gram
You know that she fuckin', she bustin it open, god damn
That's the bitch from the gram
