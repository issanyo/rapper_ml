[Verse 1]
Kick them bitches out my business
Trick Lil Koop has something for 'em
A motherfucking, a nigga knock with the warrant
I'm knowin' I gotta touch 'em, knowin' I gotta buck 'em dead
Lil bumpin' bitches creds got me runnin' from the fucking feds
Kickin' with the clizzick, trick all years still been on them slabs
They said that Koop ain't comin' clean, mane I be damned
Buck 'em down
Yo clown just gain some inches 'fore you get sprayed
Scandalous is the killa pimpin' Koopsta Knicca
Clickin' with the motherfuckin' twelve gauge
I made 'em face the grave and laid that shit like down my nig
I hit 'em real quick and counted up my dividends
The devil's in me, got me sinnin', nigga why you grinnin'?
There's no forgiveness, tell me should I let you keep a livin'?
Grab me a four, kicked in them doors like the night before
Mane hit them floors or be a ugly lookin' in the morgue
Body sore, broken skull, hoe I take yo life
Six thousand six six six - Celsius of a judgement night

[Verse 2]
I got a knock on my door man, who is it bitch?
Is it my niggas from the motherfuckin' Triple Six?
Get out my head, I'm scared, lil soon you might be dead
Don't make me put you in dread inside a homestead
Tonight's the night to make a pimp-tight fright night
We cut them bodies in chunks, done by a butcher knife
I buck 'em dead on a double cause I don't need no trouble
Mane, what the fucks a muscle to a damn bodies hustle?
My Glock goes pop and pop and make them niggas drop
Come take a ride to my motherfuckin' stash spot

[Interlude: DJ Paul]
Ahh yeah the Koopsta Knicca in this motherfucker
For all you raggedy ass hoes
For all you motherfuckin' only dick ass niggas
We motherfuckin' Prophet Posse
For all you motherfuckin' bitches
That's on our motherfuckin' shit
Y'all know what time it is
Triple 6, Triple 6, Triple 6 niggas!
