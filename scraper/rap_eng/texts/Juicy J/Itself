[Hook: Juicy J]
If that pussy good it's gon' sell itself
If that dope A1 then it's gon' sell itself
If that bankroll all 100's, it speak for itself
Do it by myself, I don't need no help
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, pussy, dope and bankrolls
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, you know how this game go
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, pussy, dope and bankrolls
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, you know how this game go

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Bitch been sellin' pussy, lookin' for them rookies
Man your bitch is took in if I catch Her lookin'
She just wanna come with me and smoke on this Cookie
I think all these bitches gay and all these niggas crooked
On my way to Cali smokin' on some Cali
Mo' money, mo' problems when I'm in the valley
I swear I love the dough, I swear I love to count it
I can tell you everything you need to know about it
What's beef to a nigga ridin' with a chopper?
Money on my mind, ain't thinkin' 'bout a robber
Run up on this Bentley you gon' need a doctor
I just have my lil' homie hop out, pop it and drop you

[Hook: Juicy J]
If that pussy good it's gon' sell itself
If that dope A1 then it's gon' sell itself
If that bankroll all 100's, it speak for itself
Do it by myself, I don't need no help
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, pussy, dope and bankrolls
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, you know how this game go
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, pussy, dope and bankrolls
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, you know how this game go

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
If I wasn't a boss don't know what I'd be
Was 19 years old in the club with no ID
I just need to flex, then she comin' home with me
All-A-All about the money, that's the only thing
Married to the game, I don't need no wedding ring
She wanna fuck a rapper, that's her biggest dream
Might get out on you, but she ain't foolin' me
In a week I might just take down two or three
Takin' trips to Vegas, I'm a major player
Smokin' kush in papers, I don't fuck with fakers
Put that pussy on a platter, she's a waitress
It ain't 'bout the money, I'm like see you later

[Hook: Juicy J]
If that pussy good it's gon' sell itself
If that dope A1 then it's gon' sell itself
If that bankroll all 100's, it speak for itself
Do it by myself, I don't need no help
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, pussy, dope and bankrolls
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, you know how this game go
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, pussy, dope and bankrolls
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, you know how this game go

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
You know how this game go, ain't no life after death
Man, somebody gotta die
Swear to God, I'm fresh to death
Bitches got you hypnotized, see it in your damn eyes
Niggas out here kickin' doors lookin' for the grand prize
See, I'm just lookin' for the baddest bitch to fuck tonight
She wanna give it up to me cause you ain't fuck her right
Shawty actin' like her fingers all she want is pipe
This my last day in town, she wanna fuck all night
But I'ma fuck and kick her out, then call another one
Yea, I'm a nasty boy so I need to double up
The world is filled with hoes, nigga, get you one
If player-hatin' was a sport you would be number one

[Hook: Juicy J]
If that pussy good it's gon' sell itself
If that dope A1 then it's gon' sell itself
If that bankroll all 100's, it speak for itself
Do it by myself, I don't need no help
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, pussy, dope and bankrolls
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, you know how this game go
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, pussy, dope and bankrolls
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, you know how this game go

[Outro: Juicy J]
You know how this game go, nigga
The pussy, the dope, the bankrolls
It's all these niggas wanna do, man, and celebrate
I don't see shit wrong with it
You're supposed to celebrate, man
It's what life is all about man, enjoy, lookin' ass nigga
