[Intro: DJ Paul]
Yo we finna drop the second side of this dope shit BITCH

[Repeating sample]
This world is...

[Verse 1: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
The definition of a playa:
A nigga that play hoes to make the ends meet
You gotta know the game
How it's played, it's all about thinkin' deep
Some gonna cross you out, some gonna smoke you out
But you can talk yo ass off
My Glock will break 'em somethin' off proper
I kick it at (?) where the playas at
Bumpin' pimpin' smokin' sacks
With Dre and RayRay in the mask
We love the city, niggas sweat up on our bitches, see
(?) hit them baby then we (?) with them dead G's
Rollin' clean, so now them robbers tryin' to follow us
Fuck number one, my number 9 will make 'em bite the dust
Pull to the curb, let them hoes hit the backseat
Ballin' 80 miles, one came up short, I pushed her in the street
Bitch I need my money, no matter
Whatever the chances, gotta snap
You get me fucked up with that shit
Talkin' 'bout yourself broke I gotta beat you hoe
... till you g-izz-et p-izz-aid you dirty bitch
Take me to a commercial
I'll be back and say what happen next

[Hook/Samples]

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks

[DJ Paul] 3x
Everything is business, ain't shit personal

[Verse 2: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
I was sittin' at the kitchen table, choppin' up my yayo
For all of a sudden I heard three shots pop through my window
I crawled to my bedroom then I reached up under my mattress
I grip my Glock
Then ran up out the door, started the cappin'
The only thing I seen was the duos from the Chevy
Three hoes in my wall got me spooked, but I ain't scary
I call up Homicide, on the other end was Michael too
I got from static, it's time to jump in my mechanic suit
When I popped the clip in to the Smith & W-e-ss-o-n
Hoe I shoot yo fuckin' granddaddy off the porch
We caught 'em slippin' he was hangin' on the backstreets
Fuck the trunk, we put his ass in the backseat
Glock in his face bitch don't look at me he tried to explain
I started to laugh and then I smacked him with my pistol mane
Diligent and (?) beat him down I started not to shoot the ho
But Goldy said smoke him, it ain't shit personal

[Hook/Samples]

[DJ Paul] 4x
Everything is business, ain't shit personal

[Verse 3: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Why I can't sleep, I'm still tired but my eyes open
Early in the morning under the sky but I'm still scopin'
Suckers I'mma rob, then jump into my costume
Jack a nigga for a key of yam, then commence to boom
Deals got my bitches on they heels, lookin' out for the cloud
Smokin' out the weed and these hoes win the fuckin' trap
My Glock is cocked to pop and drop
These niggas down to stang me
I release the clip, you slip, I chip and slip, you can't (?) a G
5-0 (?) fuck them bitches, mane we stayin' strapped
Woodlawn, (?) street smokin' city, bottles of brown
Down sound of the 12 when them coppers rollin' through
The thicker the killers the rougher the niggas
We comin' straight outta the North crew
Meanin' that slippin' with the pimpin' will get yo ass sprayed
Mike got the Tec, you least expect it cuz he got a fade
Off a lane in backyard niggas down with smokin' hoes
Everything is business bitch, ain't shit personal
