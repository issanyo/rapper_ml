[Chorus]
That's one of them things, that's one of them things
I pull up on you in one of them things, that's one of them things
My bitch hopped out, that's one of them things, that's one of them things
I hit my plug for one of them things, for one of them things
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
That's one of them things, that's one of them things
I pull up on you in one of them things, that's one of them things
My bitch hopped out, that's one of them things, that's one of them things
I hit my plug for one of them things, for one of them things
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 1]
I give her thing then I pull out
Bitch, I'm the man, I bring the whole hood out
My niggas all in the kitchen, whippin' up them things, havin' them a cookout
Lil' niggas on the lookout
She ain't suckin' thing, tell that hoe to get out
Three 6 for the whole thing, if you're playing games I bring stick out
My section full of them things, every bitch with me lookin' like a brick house
Look at that ass sit out
You can see the motherfucker 'fore she get out
Run them numbers up, get them things out
That's the only thing I care 'bout
And you know I keep that thing on me
Run up on me, get your ass aired out

[Chorus]
Things, that's one of them things
I pull up on you in one of them things, that's one of them things
My bitch hopped out, that's one of them things, that's one of them things
I hit my plug for one of them things, for one of them things
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
That's one of them things, that's one of them things
I pull up on you in one of them things, that's one of them things
My bitch hopped out, that's one of them things, that's one of them things
I hit my plug for one of them things, for one of them things
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 2]
I say a quarter brick, half a brick, it ain't [?]
Fuck that, I need that whole thing of shit
Better watch your language when you on the phone talkin' [?] shit
You will see who a bitch
My lil' nigga want a name
And I give him that thing
And that bitch go bang, and that bitch go bang
45 for the chain
That .40 go bang, catch one of them things
Gettin' head in the Range
You can't relate, that's out of your range
The Mafia
You with your gang, nigga, fuck yo' gang
They catch them things, we keep them things

[Chorus]
That's one of them things, that's one of them things
I pull up on you in one of them things, that's one of them things
My bitch hopped out, that's one of them things, that's one of them things
I hit my plug for one of them things, for one of them things
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
That's one of them things, that's one of them things
I pull up on you in one of them things, that's one of them things
My bitch hopped out, that's one of them things, that's one of them things
I hit my plug for one of them things, for one of them things
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
