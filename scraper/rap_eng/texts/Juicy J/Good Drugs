[Chorus: Young Dolph]
Why I sag like this, 'cause I don't give a damn
Why I talk this trap shit, 'cause I don't give a damn
Ayy, I just weighed a joint that weighed six grams
If she ain't a freak then I don't give a damn
Bad bitches, good drugs
Bad bitches, good drugs
Bad bitches, good drugs
Bad bitches, good drugs, good drugs

[Verse 1: Berner]
Sideshows and lil baby let the tires burn
I ain't got time for her 'less she tryna earn
Hella packs on the floor, grab the purple gloves
Got a taste of out of state money, fell in love
Fuck a safe, we dig holes somewhere in the hills
She a star plus baby girl can run in heels
Fuck the radio, they play me 'hind them prison walls
Throw me all of 'em, I bet you I can move 'em all
Atlanta Georgia for the summer, tell them trucks to leave
Extend stay on Claremont, I stayed there for a week
The W on Buckhead, that's where the smoking fee
I get eight grand a P when I'm overseas

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
Why I sag like this, 'cause I don't give a damn
Why I talk this trap shit, 'cause I don't give a damn
Ayy, I just weighed a joint that weighed six grams
If she ain't a freak then I don't give a damn
Bad bitches, good drugs
Bad bitches, good drugs
Bad bitches, good drugs
Bad bitches, good drugs, good drugs

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Taxing these niggas like Uncle Sam (fuck you pay me)
I don't fuck with the pigs but I'm goin' ham
I smoke nothin' but the killer, I call it ambulance
I got an old school faster than your fuckin' Lam' (we gone)
Niggas hate, I don't give a damn
12 come, get up out the jam
Bitch you know who the fuck I am
Fuck a ho, kick her out like Pam
My hood Afghanistan
Good dope like Pakistan
Wrap the work up, pack it in
Pull the whip up, back it in
Good dope, bad bitches
I let my workers bag the work in my Benz, bag bitches, yeah
You say no to them drugs, I can't
They don't tell me no at the bank
Gold teeth and Cuban Links
Bitch chose me 'fore she blinked

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
Why I sag like this, 'cause I don't give a damn
Why I talk this trap shit, 'cause I don't give a damn
Ayy, I just weighed a joint that weighed six grams
If she ain't a freak then I don't give a damn
Bad bitches, good drugs
Bad bitches, good drugs
Bad bitches, good drugs
Bad bitches, good drugs, good drugs
