Mafia, Mafia, Mafia, Mafia, Mafia

[Hook x2: Don Trip]
A nigga say he got a problem (Mafia)
Well, let me show you how we solve a problem (I bet you won't)
Introduce your head to a bottle (I bet you won't)
Introduce your head to a bottle (I bet you won't)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I'm crazy like Mike Tyson on cocaina
Don't fuck with me
Never joined a gang, but I done banged if you fuck with me
You see me in the baller section of the club, can't stop my blessings
Bottles in my hands, but in my pants I got that Smith & Wesson
A 30 goon beat down, I guess you ain't that street now
Don't get mad cause I'm paid, and your bitch caught me her rebound
Came up like suflé, still roll like sushi
In your bitch mouth and she gon' do what I say
I-I-I-I don't sing in autotune but sip tea and bring pain
Smoke weed, do shows, after party, get brain
Do what I do and don't give a fuck what you niggas think
Put a gun to your face (BANG)
MAFIA

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
Okay, when we in the club
Sorry I don’t dance
I just stand in the cut, and try'na grab me a tramp
I say I'm cool as a ice cube 'til shit hit the fan
Leaving a part in your head wasn't a part of my plan
Left my strap in the car, ain't no bringing it in
You lose your mind in the club and I leave your brains in your hand
I get bottles for free, and I keep one in my hand
Swing that bitch like a bat, and if it crack - grand slam
Beat 'em 'til they can't stand
If it's me you can't stand, we can let the banger talk in the lot
BLAM BLAM
Now the parking lot jammed, everybody try'na scram
Try'na make it out alive, you the only one that can’t
Nahh!
