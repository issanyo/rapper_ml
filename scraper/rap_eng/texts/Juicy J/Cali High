I'm in love with them Cali drugs, light that Cali bud
I got some weed strips, you should try you some
Pop a pill bruh, nah forreal tho
I'm just tryna get you high, I'm just tryna get you high

What you know about bein' Cali high? [x3]
Said I'm just tryna get you high, I'm just tryna get you high

I'm so high, that it got a nigga nervous
I'm so drunk that it got a nigga swervin'
Sweatin' so hard that a nigga barely breathin'
All in the slow lane, but a nigga speedin'
Inhalin' so much cali kush, try my best to try and stay woke
Windows fogged up, cadillac full of smoke
I got a DUI, so I know I can't get pulled over
No more bullshit, man I should have got a chauffeur
A nigga just high, ride late night
5 in the morning, out in cold daylight
My bitch finna trip, but I don't give a fuck
I'mma hit her with this dick.. and shut her ass up

What you know about that medical, purp with them red hairs in the--
Medicine jar with some chunks of purple weed stuffed in them
Break it down in my hands and it gets real crumbly
Sell it back in Memphis then my pockets real jumbily
Permanently inhalin kush smoke, blow it out my nose
Didnâ€™t feel like rose look, bullshit pop them more
Throwin dough at the stripper ho, show her good love
Weed smoking goin on cus we blow in the club
Pink lady maybe or blue dolphins, got them strippers at the room, and we is tossin'
Blunt in my mouth, while hers full of balls in
Pull it out her mouth rub her own strokin' balls in
