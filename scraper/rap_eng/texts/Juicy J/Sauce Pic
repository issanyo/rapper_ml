[Verse 1]
Hop out sauce pic with Wiz
Old school with big trees in it
Police pull me over, smell like a dispensary in it
Alcohol all on my breath, on my way up to Maestro
Weed on me, that shit too loud, they don't know where the stash at tho
I don't need no DUI, that belly [?] gon' keep you fry
They let me go, they know who in it
Even they can't see inside
[?]
On one, bitch I get high
Grab noodles, that shit so fire
They [?], my shit stay fire
No boo in Malibu
Still spendin' bread from 02
One oak on tuesday
A hunnid bands when I come through
[?], shit tight as hell

[Hook]
Back then hoes didn't want me

Back then hoes didn't want me
Now I'm hot, hoes all on me
(They don't know nothin' else)
Back then hoes didn't want me
Now I'm hot, hoes all on me
(They don't know nothin' else)
Back then hoes didn't want me
(Won't know nothin' else)
Now I'm hot, hoes all on me
(Won't know nothin' else)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
They got me mad today
They got me fucked top
Don't make me spazz today
Stash the eight
Loading up all of my guns
It took me half the day
I pass the K
Took my right hand man and he blast the way
We masterface
There's no way the DA gonna have a case
I laugh and say
Goodnight to the bad guy and then
We smash away
Say something, nigga smash the brakes
Pull out my tec and spray
Castaway
On this lonely island countin' up all this cake
Y'all niggas ain't been gettin' no money in a long time
I guess y'all have to wait but

[Outro]
Back then hoes didn't want me
Now I'm hot, hoes all on me
(They don't know nothin' else)
Back then hoes didn't want me
Now I'm hot, hoes all on me
(They don't know nothin' else)
Back then hoes didn't want me
Now I'm hot, hoes all on me
(They don't know nothin' else)
Back then hoes didn't want me
(Won't know nothin' else)
Now I'm hot, hoes all on me
(Won't know nothin' else)
