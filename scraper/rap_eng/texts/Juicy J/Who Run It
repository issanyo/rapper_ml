(Intro)
Yeah
You already know what this is man
It's your boy MKing
It's that Run It Remix
Let's get it
Aye

(Verse)
Who that is from Manassas, from the 703
Who that is outside, outfit on fleek
Who that is getting clout up in OHS
Yeah I'm MKing, you don't know me, but I might be next
I got hard on my beats, boy my beats so cold
Yeah I'm only 16, but I kinda feel old
I said pay for this beat, you know I can't go broke
Almost everyone today thinking life is a joke
I was born as a King, y'all can't hold me down
They don't wanna see me win, they wanna see me drown
I was born from Manassas, a really small town
I'm just speaking for myself, Ima go and speak loud
I'm just focused on myself, cuz I stay motivated
Haters all around the world, thinking I'm the most hated
I said music is my life, it's my drug, deddication
I be spitting on the mic, this is something y'all been waiting
Music changes the whole, I can't stop, I ain't letting go
I be going ham with my lyrics and this flow
People acting like they fake, I just tell em I don't know
Shoutout Ritzy, Dma, Brandon Carter, Soulo
If y'all ain't know me, now y'all know me
People acting like my homie
They be acting so phony
Cuz I'm MKing, one and only (2x)

(Outro)
Yeah man
Shoutout G Herbo
Shoutout Soulo
Shoutout Teo
Shoutout everybody who's a fan of me
Appreciate all the love
Yeah
