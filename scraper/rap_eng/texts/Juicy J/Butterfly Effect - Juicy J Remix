[Intro: Juicy J & Baka]
Hey Mike
Yeah, what up? Turn the microphone up just a little bit
This one of my favourite songs right here, had to remix this
Murda on the beat so it's not nice (uh-huh)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Juicy J]
For this life, I cannot change (yeah hoe!)
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main
M&M's, sweet like candy cane
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang (pop it, pop it)
For this life, I cannot change (yeah hoe!)
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main
M&M's, sweet like candy cane (Mafia!)
Drop the top (Mafia), pop it, let it bang

[Verse: Juicy J]
I said it can't fuck with the legacy, not at all
Niggas say they finna re-up I done spent that in the mall
Even though I'ma stand up got niggas wanna see me fall
Like I had them niggas come collect a nigga
All I gotta do is make a call
I know some bitches that be getting to it
And they trap harder than y'all
Makin' summertime in the wintertime
'Cause I know I'm hotter than 'em all
Put a hit out like the mob, feed niggas to my dawgs
Y'all fucking' with the pigs? Nigga we just ball hard
I can't even look at you now cos you so fake I'm appalled
Y'all making them statements so them cases gettin' solved
Gotta stay the fuck away from y'all, y'all gettin' too involved
I know some niggas throwing rakes up
I know some niggas reppin' finball
I know some niggas puttin' cake up
I know some niggas that'd spend it all
I know some niggas that done changed up
Some stay the same through it all
When Pat was locked up, I wrote a letter to him
Told him "we gone get it all"
I ain't had nobody playin' it nice it was just me and Paul (Mafia!)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Juicy J]
For this life, I cannot change (yeah hoe!)
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main
M&M's, sweet like candy cane
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang (pop it, pop it)
For this life, I cannot change (yeah hoe!)
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main (yeah, yeah)
M&M's, sweet like candy cane
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang (yeah)
