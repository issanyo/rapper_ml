Chorus x4
I had it figured it was someone close
Cause the nigga that's close
Are the motherfuckers that know the most

(Gangsta Boo)
It's like this
I'm tellin' my niggas about this broke ass bitch
That wanna jump into some shit
That ho done snitched on my click
We livin' swell
Pockets bail matches on her own legs
I'm livin' like the fuckin' queen
With my money I made
I got to let my nigga know before the news hit the block
That this bitch done told the Feds he was pushing them rocks
So what to do, what to do to this bitch ass snitch
She played up on my fuckin' nigga
He wasn't giving them dick
I grab my keys, get to the car
Balling to a pay phone
To call up Paul at home to get a couple of them tones
Let me see, where would she be
Hmm, is it really hard to tell
She knows the Mafia well
She knows that we gonna send her straight to hell
But I'll call down, be low key
Like I really don't know
I stay at home, stop my shipment so I won't go for broke
Someone had wanted to see us fall
But we staying on the top
We beat the playas that be balling cause the party don't stop
