[Intro]
Ayy I don't give a fuck what nobody says, this my beat
I run it haha, it's Dax, real bars, yeah, no bullshit, you ready?

[Verse]
Nigga on top I can't stop now
Now when I ride, got the top down
Best in the game with a hot sound
Niggas compare me to Pac now
Ride on my wave and you might drown
Swerve in the lane like a cop now
Bitches be wantin' the pipe now
I gotta tell 'em to pipe down
Rapping like me is not likely
God on my side, watch him hype me
You niggas trash, a crisis
Don't want no beef, you scared, so type me
See me in person, won't fight me
Came in the game like some lighting
You niggas rapping 'bout shit
Tricking these kids, man it is frighting
Violent, never be heightening
Look around, all of the violence
Crime in America pilin'
Niggas be going to jail, they can't pay the bail, you niggas be lying
Had to come here and enlighten
Had to come give you the facts, trapping is wack
You might get a stack
Your daughter at home, your mama still crying
Blacks in America dying
Trump in office, he wildin'
Droppin these bars for fun, we going to war
But look at the timing, buying
They put me in chains, confined me
I'm rapping the real but can't get a deal
These niggas is not replying
Why the system be falsifying?
They say that I might be crazy
They say that my shit too real
The reason that they cannot play me
Industry cannot detain me
A cross of Pac and Baby
I've been to hell and back, that's why they say they cannot save me
Ain't poppin' no pills, I stay in the field
These niggas is fakes, they mad that I'm real
I see that you broke, don't know how that feel
You gave up your life by signin' a deal
Might shout out to Kaep for taking a kneel
Might shout out to Jag for rappin the real
My bars is guns, they can't conceal
These niggas dumb
Not a rapper, I be in my own division
Save the world by 2020, nigga I be on a mission
I just started and I'm right exactly where I had envisioned
Niggas blind, that's why I rap, to clear their motherfucking vision
Fucking on the game
Fucking on you bitches who've been fucking for the fame
I've be getting rich and dodging niggas who ain't changed
Tried to tell my shooters, had to read [?] out the chain
With a bitty lil name, lil nigga you ain't gang
You not, circle small, like a dot
Keep it tight 'cause people like to come and try and make you fall
I've seen it all, it's fine
They'll try and stop your shine
They snakes, still smile up in your face but talk that shit behind, behind

[Outro]
I seen it all baby, watch out for these snakes in the grass
They sayin' just enough to your face to keep you happy
That way in case you do make it, they can say they been there
Ayy DJ cut the beat, cut the beat
Hip hop is not dead and never left
It's just a book collectin' dust I found on the shelf
I don't care if you wanna read it or anybody else
'Cause I'll turn myself to Jesus and resurrect it myself
