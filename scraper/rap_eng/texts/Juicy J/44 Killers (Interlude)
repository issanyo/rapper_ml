[Hook: DJ Paul and Juicy J]
I'm bout to blow them boys ass off
Whatcha niggas wanna do?
I'm bout to blow them boys ass off
Talkin all that fuckin shit
I'm bout to blow them boys ass off
Coward ass bitches
I'm bout to blow them boys ass off
Whatcha niggas wanna do?
I'm bout to blow them boys ass off
Talkin all that fucking shit
I'm bout to blow them boys ass off
Fighting niggas over a bitch
I'm bout to blow them boys ass off
Fuck you motherfuckin hoes
I'm bout to blow them boys ass off

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
To you haters I'm the predator
Set em up, wet em up
When I'm in the hood, I'm like a drug-dealer regular
Chrome poppin', bird shoppin', droppin',  don't ya step to tha
Triple six, guns click, bitch we the murderers

[Verse 2: Crunchy Black]
Triple six is the clique, why y'all niggas keep hatin me
Y'all gone make a nigga posse up and come and getcha bitch
Grab that nigga by his throat, if he hollas, let em go
I ain't gon' let that nigga go, I'mma hit it at em wit da fourty-four

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
I'mma sic' em, heat em, leave em bleedin
Fill em fulla millimeter
Bitch ass nigga, torture treat em
Creature feature, coke and weed
Soze to L-O-R-D, sippin' ounces of that lean-ah
Ask me if I worship Satan, I'mma send yo ass ta see him

[Verse 4: DJ Paul]
Now tell me how you boys talk wit all that shit in yo mouth
And how the hell you down ta key that open doors for tha Mid-South?
I put half of you haters on, make half of you haters groan
Left half of you haters alone
And watched you die all on your own and feel for ya

[Hook: DJ Paul and Juicy J]
