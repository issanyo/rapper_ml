[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Hood nigga for life, these bitches admire
I don't do no talking bruh', this is how I'm replying
Shoot niggas, phone tapping niggas bout his wife
That's gon' have you somewhere in a ditch, bodies tied
I mob like Carlo Gambino, make movies like Tarantino
Flying in a Phantom with a Philippino, counting C notes
Thirty bands in my pocket, double cup in hand
Ice all over me, I'm like an avalanche
I ride with a machine gun, hundred round drum
Cause these jack boys hungry, they ain't ate none
Nigga cross me, need to think for a second
Make sure youâ€™re strapped and your mama got your dental records

[Hook: Juicy J]
They asking for the beef, imma' gon' be their waiter
I'm speaking dollar signs, you might need a translator
Fruity bubble gum kush, that's a nigga flavor
I'm chasing money now shorty, I'll catch ya later
They asking for the beef, imma' gon' be their waiter
I'm speaking dollar signs, you might need a translator
Fruity bubble gum kush, that's a nigga flavor
I'm chasing money down shorty, I'll catch ya later

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Hungry for that drama, hundred drum, I'm gonna feed them
Hit them up on ? let the block and junkies tweet it
Gun shots when I greet them, Calico, there they go
Bet they fold, to Allah, Sammy So', imma', imma'
Hood nigga for life, too bitches to pipe
Couple pounds of smoke, on that remy white
Don't play with your life, don't play with your ho
Don't play with your kids, nigga don't play with your noes
They trying to lean me over, catch me in that drop
Must be on that yoda, thirty racks or what
Coke team, codeine, two pots, on that stove
Watch them lean, whip it slow, cocaine mafia

[Hook]
