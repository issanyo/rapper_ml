( Intro )

You are now listening to Italianno records
Yeah, It is... Head honcho baby



( Hook )


Who run it
Who run it
I run it
Who run it
I run it
Who run it
I runt it
Who run it


( Verse 1 )


I am who I say I am
I'm a industry booth
Studio session killer
When I step on the mic
Ladies say I'm iller
I gotta 50 flavors
Choose one, vanilla
Rap game ain't safe
Ever since I walked in
Nigga, I run this
My flow ice cold
Like that nigga Jadakiss
Ask your baby mama
She dig the way I flow
Oh, I'm mixed with Biggie and Pac
Plus I don't rap
Nigga I spit crack
Like the homie Craig Mack
I don't knick flavor in your ear
I bang a mack 10 in your ear     ( Paaa )
My pen game is insane
Yeah, call me Shakespeare
I'm willing to be killing
All these mumble rappers
I gotta the game in my hand
In case you didn't know
Yeah, I'm the man
And I ain't saying
I'm the man cause I gotta a D    ( Deee)
Check my music profile
Nigga I been hot, like cooking oil
I'm a old school, new school
What's that classic
In this rap game
I'm more like a goat
You more like a cow
Ask your hoe, I don't do drugs
But I gotta cocaina  flow
I'm well-known nigga
I be taking flights
While you stuck in the hood
I gotta you nigga looking like
Man, I wish I could
I'm a big baller
Call me if you need a scholar
I take care of my niggas
Like I take care of my daughter
I talk a nigga bring my money
And he better bring it
Cause I'm not a talker
I'm more like a shooter
