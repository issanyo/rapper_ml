[Intro]
I'ma tell you broke niggas something
Listen

[Verse 1]
Make money, no vacation
Pay cash, don't make payments
Getting high like I'm eighteen
But I've been rich since the late eighties
Backstage, naked ladies
Popping pills and swallowing babies
Bad bitches ain't come to play
She gon' give me head before I go on stage
New car, a couple, a hundred, ain't nothin' I call it play money
Bugatti, Ferrari, the Benz, the Bentley, Juicy stay stuntin'
Street niggas, we packing them tools
Play with it, make action news
Put some money on your head, you worth a stack or two
Real nigga I'm 100, I sip lean and I chase money
Niggas out here saving hoes, niggas need to be saving money
Made mine, can't take it from me
Hit the club, I take your woman
Take her home, get some head
Wake up breakfast in bed
Yeah nigga that's grits and eggs
Rich bitch don't forget the bread
Up and down that interstate
I move weight, that's Jenny Craig
I'ma fuck me a model, I'ma fuck me a model
You only get to live one time, so I'ma fuck me a model

[Hook]
I make money all day then I ball with the profits
Niggas hating on me, I tell em hating niggas stop it
Go fuck with a bitch, get that becky then I'm gone
Catch me on that loud pack, blowing on this strong

I make money all day then I ball with the profits
Niggas hating on me, I tell em hating niggas stop it
Go fuck with a bitch, get that becky then I'm gone
Catch me on that loud pack, blowing on this strong

[Interlude]
Straight out of north Memphis nigga
20 years in
Still rich and ain’t gon stop getting rich
Told you niggas I ain’t gon' never gonna stop getting money
Let’s get it

[Verse 2]
Bitch you ain’t no killer and real niggas don’t talk
Start shit in this club, It’s going down in the parking lot
Niggas get killed everyday, we ain't shedding no tears
Niggas can’t keep they mouth closed, judge give you them years
Yo homie fucking yo bitch and she ain't sucking your cock
Them niggas ain't holding you down and you call them niggas yo dogs
They really out here hating, so stay strapped up like a tank
They got guns they got in movies except they not shootin' blanks
Pass straight in broad daylight, they don’t care who looking
Young niggas got something to prove, nigga think he pussy
Playing round in my hood and they'll smoke you like a Swisher
We don’t play 'bout money and we don’t play with them pistols

[Hook]
I make money all day then I ball with the profits
Niggas hating on me, I tell em hating niggas stop it
Go fuck with a bitch, get that becky then I'm gone
Catch me on that loud pack, blowing on this strong

I make money all day then I ball with the profits
Niggas hating on me, I tell em hating niggas stop it
Go fuck with a bitch, get that becky then I'm gone
Catch me on that loud pack, blowing on this strong
