[Intro]
Uh huh your boy Juicy J
Yo I had to make this song with a Beautiful One
Cause it seems like all the time the beautiful one's be the most thirsty

[Hook] x4
This is for the THOT's
Thirsty ass ho's on me
(T-H-O-T)

[Verse 1]
Take a look at her back account, shorty ain't got a dime
She only get out of bed, so she can twerk on Vine
Time to go get some money, baby, don't care if you popular
She think she's a model, cause she's got 3,000 followers
But that don't pay your bills, that won't feed your kids
In the club every night, you think that's where she lives
Leave the kids with her momma while she go 'round the corner
She gon' bust it wide open, then come home without a token
Got her legs wide open, got your nose wide open
Tryna confront like she somthin', homeboy you must be jokin'
She not worth it, she been up and down the block
Lil shorty ain't no wifey, now that's what you call a thot

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She a freak so you know she got some freak friends
Need a babysitter every single weekend
I know you know the type, so caught up in the hype
Want a man that got his own, meanwhile they sharing tights
They at all the after parties, fuckin' all the ball players
Girl, them pussy walls dead you gon' need a pallbearer
But them niggas be thirsty, they be gassin' you up
All them real niggas lookin' at you laughin' it up
I hope you wrappin' it up, give that pussy a break
All them niggas you fuckin', you never been on a date
Baby you know who you are, it's written all over your face
Go look in the mirror, point your finger and say

[Hook]

[Outro]
The beautiful ones
I'mma toast up right now
I got some champagne
I'mma toast it up for all the beautiful ones
Cause those the really thirsty ones
So my nigga, make sure you wrap it up
And don't give these freaks all your money
Cause they gon' take it and spend it with another nigga
Let's go!
