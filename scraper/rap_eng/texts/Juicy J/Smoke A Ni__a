Yo, too damn high

[Chorus: x2]
This OG Kush, what I'm smokin' nigga
Put the fire to a hater, and smoke a nigga
I pull them whips out, and I'm smokin' nigga
You think you hot as me, hold on, you must be smokin' nigga

Cali weed in a dutch, purple lean in my cup
Smokin' while I'm drivin', nigga we be fucked up
Hit the weed then pass out, homie you an amateur
This bitch is bad as fuck so I'mma grab that camera bruh
Peelin' bank rolls , Condo full of bad bitches
Lot of pills, lot of weed, and a lot of liquor
Sprinkle hash on a blunt bitch Im rich and double cup
Ain't no time bein' wasted time to roll another up
Trippy niggas getting high, man that's what we all do
She know I'm with them Taylors, wanna fuck the whole crew
Smokin' out the phantom Rolls, tryna stay low key
If what's in the air then you know its me

[Chorus]
This OG Kush, what I'm smokin' nigga
Put the fire to a hater, and smoke a nigga
I pull them whips out, and I'm smokin' nigga
You think you hot as me, hold on, you must be smokin' nigga

Smokin' on this potent, feelin' like I'm floatin'
Lookin' like I'm Chinese cause my eyes are barely open
Weed in my king size and right beside me got that potion
Rollin' up that ganja all my diamonds like the ocean
All looked like I cloned em, all look like they glowin'
All look like they snowin', I should build a snowman
Pulled out my garage to show my car cause I'm a showman
Can't get in my closet cause I got all of this clothin'
Smokin' out Ill show you how to roll one up and blow it down
I'm on the stage you in the crowd I'm in the air you on the ground
You on that uh, I'm on that loud
I'm on that island Veuve Clicquot money pilin'

[Chorus]
This OG Kush, what I'm smokin' nigga
Put the fire to a hater, and smoke a nigga
I pull them whips out, and I'm smokin' nigga
You think you hot as me, hold on, you must be smokin' nigga

I got a bad bitch on a hash pipe, and that ass right
I don't know Lil shawty name, I just call her last night
Ballin' hard coppin' foreign cars like they half price
Blowin' loud, Juicy J be higher than the gas price
Mary Jane, bitch I get so high call me Eddy Kane
Freaky bitch, and she drippin' wet, its a hurricane
Dope boy, I got it on my own, I come from sellin' stones [?]
Old school, nigga get naked like a hairy bone [?]
Codeine all in my cup, I got your queen all on my nuts
I spray she drink it up, that's right she freaky as fuck
Trippy nigga fresh to death, like the after life
Juicy J I feel outta space, cause I'm gettin' higher than a satellite

[Chorus]
This OG Kush, what I'm smokin' nigga
Put the fire to a hater, and smoke a nigga
I pull them whips out, and I'm smokin' nigga
You think you hot as me, hold on, you must be smokin' nigga
