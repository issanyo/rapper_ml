[Intro]
Juicy J, Belly, Tory Lanez
It's for the chicks, mane

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & (Juicy J)]
Did I forget to mention?
The way that you twistin' and movin' your body got me so on and then some
I'd probably do it, I know that you probably movin' on and on and on and on
On and on and on
You're probably moving on and on and on and on
DJ playing your song (Yeah hoe!)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Nigga, I'm on one, I'm on that
She on me, she want that
We communicate on a higher level, them pussy lips talk back
Fucking on a Xan, we don't need a bed
Make a mess when you give me head
Slob on my knob like a chicken head
Talk dirty to it, she like what I said
One more shot for the bitches (for the bitches)
Two more shots for the hoes (for the hoes)
Beat it up like Evander, 'till you knocked out cold
I'm in her mouth like a toothbrush
Hit it from the back 'till I touch her soul (you know it)
You're just tryna get it and I'm tryna block 'cause I know you tryna reach your goal
That pussy ain't really worth bragging 'bout
But the pretty little bitch got a nasty mouth
On the Snap, on the sink, and her ass is out
I bet these niggas be cashing out (ching)
Pull up in the drop, bet I touch that spot
Shawty wanna ball, better touch that rock
Let her touch that paper, never touch that work
If you ain't gon' shoot don't touch that Glock

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & (Juicy J)]
Did I forget to mention?
The way that you twistin' and movin' your body got me so on and then some
I'd probably do it, I know that you probably movin' on and on and on and on
On and on and on
You're probably moving on and on and on and on
DJ playing your song (Yeah hoe!)

[Verse 2: Belly]
I was high as Tony
I remember all these bitches clowned me
Now they linin' up around the block to come around me
Only time you held me down is when you tried to drown me (yeah)
I'm a fucking savage, should've left me where they found me
Ayy now, I just say the word, she on the way down
He gon' probably find out any day now
Boy, adjust to come-ups, you gon' stay down (oh no)
Told her chill, 'cause I need a couple pills
Just to get in my zone
Talking Audemars with the automobile (shit)
Just to see the time go, whoa
Stop it baby, let's not be crazy
That's Versace, that's not Versacee (whoa)
Took the shot but now I got fellaci
Oh, that's top in the drop, Mercedes, yeah

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & (Juicy J)]
Did I forget to mention?
The way that you twistin' and movin' your body got me on and then some
I'd probably do it, I know that you probably movin' on and on and on and on
On and on and on
You're probably moving on and on and on and on
DJ playing your song (Yeah hoe!)
