[Intro]
Mane I'm geeked up, play that shit
Man I'm geeked up, man I'm geeked up
Man I'm geeked up, man I'm geeked up

Man I'm geeked up, man I'm geeked up

[Hook]
Ecstasy pills, Xanax pills and some Percocet
Ambien, Oxycontin pills, let's do all that
Ecstasy pills, Xanax pills and some Percocet
Ambien Oxycontin pills, let's do all that
Let's get high, let's get high, let's get high, let's get high
Let's get high, let's get high, let's get high, let's get high
Let's get high, let's get high, let's get high, let's get high

[Verse 1]
I got a bag of pills, nigga I'm in a battlefield
I'm at the club makin' a killin' like this can't be real
I'm takin' shots of Goose while these hoes gettin' loose
You know these girls love to get high in the DJ booth
I met a Asian chick, man she had these braids and shit
She had been rolling by the hour and she want some dick
We didn't make it to the booth we in the bathroom
She started sucking on my dick, I was like wooh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Left out the bathroom cause I got to kill my beers
I told the girl before I left "You can keep the jizz"
I'm at the DJ booth so I popped a Xanny pill
I washed it down with Jäger, nigga, yeah I'm keeping it real
I'm trying to get a fill, plus this club a little weird
Ain't nobody got no grill but they snortin' our dollar bills
All kinds of girls off in the club, I don't discriminate
I'm just a nigga that get high and put dick in your face

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Oh it ain't over, no sir
The club is closing, now I'm try'na rush up to the bar
I need 5 Jäger shots and another bar
Didn't wanna serve me cause I'm stumbling all over the place
The bartender kept saying "Man, you look shit faced"
I said shit face, nigga, I got a shit race
I put my fist off in yo' mouth and that's how shit taste
He called security then the bouncers threw me up out the bitch
But that's ok I called a cab and then I hit the strip club

[Hook]

[Outro]
Man I'm geeked up, man I'm geeked up
Man I'm geeked up...
