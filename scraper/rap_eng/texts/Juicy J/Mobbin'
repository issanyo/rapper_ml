[Intro+Hook]
I've been mobbin' with this chopper
Looking for this nigga that owe me money
I've been mobbin' with this chopper
Looking for this nigga that owe me money
When I find him, I'm gonna burn him
This nigga better have my motherfucking money
I've been mobbin' with this chopper
Looking for this nigga that owe me money
When I find him, I'm gonna burn him
This nigga better have my motherfucking money

[Verse 1:Juicy J]
I see this nigga belonged to my money
Nigga ain't answered my calls or nothing
Someone's gonna have to mob down on this nigga
Taking 50k let him meet these triggers
I see this nigga belonged to my money
Nigga ain't answered my calls or nothing
Someone's gonna have to mob down on this nigga
Taking 50k let him meet these triggers
For dodging my calls, I'ma burn his ass
For taking so long, I'ma burn his ass
He ain't got my money, I'ma kill his ass
So I don't ever have to deal with his ass
A nigga is gonna learn or a nigga gonna die
Tell me something nigga come up with a lie
Cuz I ain't gonna let this shit here ride
I need my money and I need it right now
Bitch burn you niggas, and I'm like fuck it
I'ma just finna fly down and start bussin
Pill talk nigga, that's the end of the discussion
Pay a nigga back if you owe him something

[Hook x2]
I've been mobbin' with this chopper
Looking for this nigga that owe me money
When I find him, I'm gonna burn him
This nigga better have my motherfucking money

[Verse 2:Reno]
Baby now call the cellphone he ain't tryna answer that
No he don't want these problems, nah I [?]
I ain't ever be no food this nigga tryna play me
Is this guy crazy or is he fucking dumb?
If he ain't got it all, he better get me some
I mean give me some, I'm jumping out real quick
Before I mask up and get up on this gangsta shit
