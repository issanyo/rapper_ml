[Hook/Sample]
Drinkin' on tha Alizé, high as a motherfucker

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
I need a fuckin' drink so I can hit the fuckin' town
I need some Alizé because I'm tired of that fuckin' Crown
Because that hard shit make me do rude shit
That's why I drink the Alizé because it's the smooth shit
I buy myself a fifth because I like to drink a whole lot
I buy the bitch a half a pint cause it gets so real hot
Because these niggas in the BHZ can't (?)
Drink the Alize with a half a ounce of Buddha bling

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
My nigga Paul just be drinkin' on the Alizé
Ridin' in my short dog, campaign it all day
Stoppin' over bitches house just because we got cloud
Let me take my dick out, insert it in her mouth
Cause it nothin' new to watch ya chew off my beast
You make my flesh crawl with the hotness of a fuckin' tea
A pimp tight nigga with them thangs for you bustas
I told you Juicy J one loc motherfucker

[Hook/Sample]
Drinkin' on tha Alizé
Drinkin' on tha Alizé
Drinkin' on tha Alizé, high as a motherfucker

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
Well at the summer time and I'm thinkin' about
Them freaky, freaky bitches that are locked up in a (?) house
(?) nigga like me gotta keep the hookup
On some real (?) dick suckers
For nights like the last motherfucker
Scarecrow, Nigga Nine, Juicy J and Homicide
Frosty big berry lemonade with liquor (?) ride
And my nigga Lil Buck gotta drive my colours
With the Chucky on the trunk because I'm drunk

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
Drinkin' on tha Alizé makes me reminisce
The time I had to dick on a little red bitch
Not knowin' all the time that the hoe was a traitor
The way that she look will probably make a nigga rape her
But fuck that bullshit cause I can game for a trick
Drop off the stupid hoe and pick up another bitch
Ridin' through Evergreen where all the playas stay
With a little E&J mixed with a Alizé

[Hook/Sample]
Drinkin' on tha Alizé
Drinkin' on tha Alizé
Drinkin' on tha Alizé, high as a motherfucker
