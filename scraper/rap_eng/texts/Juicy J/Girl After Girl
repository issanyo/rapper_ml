[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Me her her and her, grab her by her hair
Naked girls in here, girls touchin on girls
Your lil precious daughter, got her high as hell
Make her pop a pill, still let her hit the blunt till
She feels like I feel, will not just cost a lil
Back round like a hill, these hoes are for real
Me her and her friends, they look like they twins
She so fuckin fine that I touched her up again
Told her next time she can bring her other friend
Then I lost her number never seen again
The best brain in the world, do her thing with a girl
But don't call her yo girl, yo listen I a'int with yo girl
