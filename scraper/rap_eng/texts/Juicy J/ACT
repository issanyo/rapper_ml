[Hook]
Don't you know I got beans in my lean
I go green, I sip all Act
I don't want no red if it ain't Act, then don't call back
What you know about Act? What you know about Act?
What you know about Act? I know all about that

Pour me up a 4 and some more, I need all that
You ain't never drank like this before, nigga fall back
What you know about Act? What you know about Act?
What you know about Act? I know all about that

[Verse 1]
Oh you say you got that work, oh you got some syrup
Oh you say you got some bird, that'll you murked
Oh you say it's for a stack, I'ma call you back
Cause that shit-a get you wacked, if that shit ain't Act
Load the drug up then I told my niggas get the fuck up
Nigga hit me up like he the plug, got me fucked up
Say that shit real but if it's fake, he getting fucked up
If that shit real my nigga then we done loved her
If that shit real, we charging them niggas 6 a deuce
I'm pouring up a 4 and I need 'em so don't forget the juice
Undercut the competition, charge them niggas 62
Sell a hunnid pints of that shit then go get you 62's

[Hook]
Don't you know I got beans in my lean

[Verse 2]
I pull up on this nigga, he was nervous
Nigga so scary, I'm suprised that nigga served us
I'ma come and get it, that's that front door service
But I'm picky to myself that I should murk 'em
My nigga like hold him, give him a chance
He made us come all the way for his bands
Plus I'm tweaking and geeking off all these xans
Here he come right now, he walking to the van
He like always Juicy J and he a fan
I sipped it it real slow as I shook his hand
I'm like fuck all that groupie shit, you the man

[Hook]
Don't you know I got beans in my lean

What you know about Act? I know all about that

Pour me up a 4 and some more, I need all that
You ain't never drank like this before, nigga fall back
What you know about Act? What you know about Act?
