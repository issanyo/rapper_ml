[Intro]
Nigga play with me, get his ass busted
Blowin’ cash and I’ve got cash I ain’t touched yet
I’m tryna fuck every bitch I ain’t fuck yet
Haven’t met a motherfucker I can trust yet

[Verse 1]
You out here stuntin, lyin’ and…
Before you know it, they’ll be IDing your body
Layin’ dead in the morgue, we don’t play that shit
Catch your car at the mall, we gon’ spray that shit
And them niggas that’s with ya can’t do nothin’ but miss ya
AK47, boy, that shit shoots missiles
Got my whole hood with me – king of the city
I drink like a redneck, and smoke like a hippy
Put a price on your head, maybe your brother will kill ya
For that money, it could be any one of your niggas
And he throwin’ more bullets than the Super Bowl
Nigga, if you don’t shoot to kill, what’re you shootin’ for?
You niggas shakin’ – you niggas scared
We takin’ head shots, you shoot the legs
Bitch-ass nigga, you ain’t ’bout that life
You may come from the streets, but you ain’t got no stripes
Keep on payin’ these hoes – one gon’ set you up
Lay you down, and not even Life Alert can help you up
Niggas killin’ every day, over a couple of bandz
So what you think they gon’ do for a hundred grand?

[Hook]
Nigga play with me, get his ass busted
Blowin’ cash and I’ve got cash I ain’t touched yet
I’m tryna fuck every bitch I ain’t fuck yet
Haven’t met a motherfucker I can trust yet
Nigga play with me, get his ass busted
Blowin’ cash and I’ve got cash I ain’t touched yet
I’m tryna fuck every bitch I ain’t fuck yet
Haven’t met a motherfucker I can trust yet

[Verse 2]
You bitches out here lyin’ like you movin’ juices
A nigga fronted your ass a bomb, now you’ve got excuses
Now you tryna hide, dodgin’ our phone calls
A nigga’ll catch up with your ass, knock your dome off
Put a hole in your head, what’d you expect?
Playin’ with a nigga money, that’s disrespect
Fuck around and get your baby mama tied up
A nigga’ll pull up on you sprayin’ like a fire truck
Set your mama house on fire, nail the door shut
Ain’t nobody gettin’ out, it’s over, bruh
And over what? Niggas ain’t takin’ shit
These niggas really ’bout that life, you out here fakin’ it

[Hook]
