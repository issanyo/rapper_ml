[Intro]
Yeah, nigga (sips)
That Bombay and Lemonade, mane
Got a nigga fucked up over here, mane, you know what I'm saying?
In the studio, puttin' in this work, nigga
Let's get It
(YK)

[Hook]
I'm the only one up
Like I just popped me a Molly and dropped me a flat in my cup (cup)
I'm the only one up
Like I just hit me a lick (lick), off by myself with the stick (stick), you don't even exist
I'm the only one up
Ride by myself with the stick (stick), you don't even exist
I'm the only one up
Like I just popped me a Molly and dropped me a flat in my cup
I'm the only one up
Like I just hit me a lick (lick), by myself with the stick (stick)
I'm the only one up
Ride by myself with the stick (stick), you don't even exist
I'm the only one up
Ride by myself with the stick (stick), you don't even exist
I'm the only one up

[Verse: 1]
I'm the only one up (up), I got your rent in my cup (my cup)
Mercedes car note on my feet (feet), probably won't wear these but once (once)
Your savings account on my neck (my neck), I’m ballin’ out nothin’ but net (net)
Point the AK at they chest (chest), for niggas that show some respect (respect)
Niggas be hatin’, niggas be petty, I’m living like the connect (uhh)
You tryna get it, you want that bag, learn how to jig and finesse (uhh)
You tryna whip, you tryna flip it, nigga, learn how to invest (uhh)
You said you with it, but can’t put a ticket, my nigga I’m not as impressed (uhh)
Got a lil’ thot on the mollies, I think her name Molly, she came in a dress (uhh)
Throw hundreds all over lil’ shawty, the time of her life, she won’t ever regret (uhh)
Puttin' in work and workin' these bitches without even breaking a sweat (uhh)
I swear sometime I be feelin' like Nike 'cause I’m pullin' off with a check (uhh)

[Hook]
I’m the only one up
Like I just popped me a Molly and dropped me a flat in my cup
I’m the only one up
Like I just hit me a lick, off by myself with the stick, you don’t even exist
I’m the only one up
Ride by myself with the stick, you don’t even exist
I’m the only one up
Like I just popped me a Molly and dropped me a flat in my cup
I’m the only one up
Like I just hit me a lick, by myself with the stick
I’m the only one up
Ride by myself with the stick, you don’t even exist
I’m the only one up
Ride by myself with the stick, you don’t even exist
I’m the only one up

[Verse: 2]
I’m the only one up, guess I should tell you what’s up
I taught them niggas ‘bout fuckin’ shit up
I spent 10 bands in the store it ain’t nothin’
I’m too busy counting, pourin’ shit up
Hella wasted, fuckin' more shit up
I’m on fire, I be blowin' shit up
Got the gangbangers throwin' shit up
Aye, all of these bottles I can’t even drink it all, I’ll pour it all on a slut
All of this OG, I can’t even it smoke it all, nigga, you came for the puff
All of these racks on me, I tried to blow it all, took me bout more than a month
I'm still on, I started way back in the day and I'm probably the only one up

[Fading outro]
