[Hook: Lil Glock, Project Pat, & ?]
Bitches thinkin' "who was it?", bitch, it was Triple Six
Ridin' in your neighborhood, bitch, with the Glock cocked
Bitches thinkin' "who was it?", bitch, it was Triple Six
Shootin' motherfuckers at point blank range
Bitches thinkin' "who was it?", bitch, it was Triple Six
Ridin' in your neighborhood, bitch, with the Glock cocked
Bitches thinkin' "who was it?", bitch, it was Triple Six
Shootin' motherfuckers at point blank range

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Deadly measures are the consequence, I pray for apocalypse
I quickly drop you bitch, feel the flame of the arsonist
Bullets knocking niggas down, as if they were heat seekin'
Scalping me more damn fools than a lunatic Mohican
Slaughtering motherfuckers, don't give a damn if people are watching
Passin' niggas droppin' out a black van like a SWAT team
I'm stalking, watch me, a weaponry master
Walkin' over dead bodies layin' in the pasture
Step into the dark roads, hoe, but you didn't know
These bloody, scary grounds were haunted by the Scarecrow
Maze of the horrifying terror to the maximum
Keeper of the devil's will, Lord Infamous axe murderer
(?) ya guts, come with us the real astonishment
The place where corpses hang like motherfuckin' ornaments
Busta ass niggas, you knows I fold 'em
Motherfuckers eyes, I will permanently close them

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I'm comin' through the crowd with this motherfuckin' nine tone
Camouflage in the dark, with a pair of Locs on
Lettin' these niggas know that I'm fed up with this straight shit
You wanna be something you're not so I'm lettin' you know you get yo wig split
The Juice Mane is in this motherfucker, ready to tear shit up
Easily execute niggas, make these bitches bite the dust
Grown up in the hood, a nigga always stayed low-key
Yo I did a vacation, people always ask "Who is he?"
Tip-toe real quiet, leave a hoe to wanna try me
I always had crazy thoughts, the demons walk behind me
Pushin' me to the edge, sayin' it's cool to fill a bitch up with lead
Write a list of niggas I don't like and leave 'em all dead
Life is too short, I'd rather be tucked in a straitjacket
Visions in my mind, lock me up because I can't hack it
When it hit the fan in my mind a nigga can't forget it
If somebody ask I'm gonna say "Triple Six did it"

[Verse 3: Kingpin Skinny Pimp & Juicy J]
(?), loadin' a 5.0, the Skinny Pimp on a creep
Slowly, smokin' these bitches never low-key
Project life that I live, pimpin' (?) with a gun
Shoot that fool, make a move while I (?) harpoon
Nervous, yo head full of veins, you can't be hard
Robbery squad on my knob, bitches pullin' hoe cards
These bitches pullin' hoe cards, these niggas think they too hard
I wanna pull my gat and blow these suckers head apart
Cause niggas be claimin' Triple Six to try to get they name out
And try to diss on tape because they know they pockets assed out
So how you gon' diss when you know you ain't shit
Tryna bring yoself out, ridin' other folk dick
You nigga, you bitch, I'm gonna c-click
On any lemon lame to underestimate the Triple Six
You wanna throw them thangs
You get dumped in the garbage ditch
We watchin' every move you make, nigga this is real black
Triple Six Mafia tellin' you hoes to watch yo back
