[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
Word around town, I'm the man, nigga
Break that bitch down to the grams, nigga
16 Os in a pound, nigga
Quarterback draw, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Next day air, no ground, nigga

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
Took a loss, had a nigga on Slim Fast
Now I'm movin' weight like gym class
Broke it down, every bag like Sinbad
How I get this bread? Mind your business
Sell it on site and I go half price
Don't got my bread? On your head, no lice
Wrap it up good, no smell, that's right
Cut the box open, no Jordan, that's flight
She look good, so I'm stackin' numbers
Next morning, another trackin' number
Lookin' for a bad bitch I can bust down
Trickin' off field goal, I need a touchdown

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
Word around town, I'm the man, nigga
Break that bitch down to the grams, nigga
16 Os in a pound, nigga
Quarterback draw, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Next day air, no ground, nigga

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Word around town, I'm the man, nigga
Want it all, break it down to the grams, nigga
Ballin', cool 500 grand, nigga
You ain't talkin' money, I don't understand, nigga
Uptown, nigga, bust down, nigga
Face down, nigga, James Brown, nigga
Ass up with your legs shakin'
Time for work, know I gotta fill the van, bake
It ain't how you get it, it's what you do with it
Flip 21, 42 with it
Two hands up, touchdown, nigga
100 grams, lift you with the ground, nigga

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
Word around town, I'm the man, nigga
Break that bitch down to the grams, nigga
16 Os in a pound, nigga
Quarterback draw, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Next day air, no ground, nigga

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Juicy J, no days off, full time hustlin'
Shawty I'm the plug, I don't gotta touch nothin'
Send 'em your way, I just gotta press a button
If the price ain't right, nigga, I ain't budgin'
Niggas starvin' in the streets, their ribs touchin'
You lookin' like food and we got the munchies
Quarterback legendary, John Elway
Ridin' with the Bulldog .38, no shell case
G-5, take off of the coast
A nigga been had more mils than Quaker Oats
Taylor Gang, flyin' first class on a paper plane
With a foreign chick but I still can't pronounce her name
Stuff a hundred grand in a Honda Civic
We'll get it from the ground and the sky is the limit
Gettin'  face in the car from another nigga's broad
Smokin' football fields, rollin' up a hundred yards, touchdown

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
Word around town, I'm the man, nigga
Break that bitch down to the grams, nigga
16 Os in a pound, nigga
Quarterback draw, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Next day air, no ground, nigga
