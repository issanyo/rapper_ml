[Intro]
Hey you wanna get high man?
I got a joint here man, been saving this for a special occasion

[Hook]
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back

[Verse 1]
THC in my DNA, Hennessey in my cup
Shell net MDMA you know what's in my blunt (What?)
Blue Dream that's what, stuffed 3.5 em' up
Money long like train smoke, my pockets like my blunts
Niggas all in my bankroll, ain't got time for no fronts
If shawty got a ass like a stripper so a nigga might tip her mane I ain't gon' front
Swear her ass so fake, ain't gotta turn around, I can see it from the front
You done seen her ass on TV nigga
I done seen that ass in 3D nigga
And there's still niggas tryna be me nigga
I been blowing gas like VP nigga
Ran out of gas on the E-Way, took a Xannie bar and some Hennessey
Talking to a bitch, catch your bitch on the other line
Probably tryna have another 3 way
She wanna do this shit again, that's a replay
Fuck her, tell her bring it back to the DJ
Go DJ

[Hook]
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back

[Verse 2]
See you can't smoke this weed and you can't sip what's in my cup
Cause you ain't dope as me my nigga ain't no keeping up
I'm about to smoke as much as I can stuff a Dutch
I'm about to sip as much as I can double cup
Extensions I double up, ain't long, look like double Dutch
The moment you flooding out
Is the moment that you fucked up
I dropped the bean my lean and im up ??
You drop that lady that stuff
I got some bitches that play with their nose and they ready to party and planning to fuck
I'm tryna play with that pussy, I spit on that pussy
She making a friendly get up
I spend a day with the pussy, I pop me a molly
You ain't got no problems getting up
You gotta pay for that pussy, I lay with that pussy
And barely take her out for lunch
You tryna stay with that pussy, I play with that pussy
And never call her back for months

[Hook]
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back
Once the drugs take control, ain't no holding back
Once the drugs in your soul, ain't no coming back
