[Lil E sample] 7x
Ridin' in the Chevy, yes he also smoke the ink mane

[Verse 1: Lil Noid]
We ridin’ in the Chevy with them bones and them vogue thangs
Headin' down on Beale just to kill for them damn lames
Talkin' shit because they know I’m (?) off that holy dope
Jealous ass niggas make mad and bump this cannot cope
Scopin' out these bitches with the game of a real mack
Ready to take a young hoe to the crib so I can break her back
Head to the liquor store and now I'm drinkin' E&J
(?) is on my side, he called Fly up and now we smokin' hay
Kick it like some playas but we out we hit the hotel room
Bitches in bikinis actin' freaky off that (?)
Fucked 'em dropped 'em off, they said (?) that fuckin’ Chevy thang
Clean as hell mane, but playas keep the shit the fuckin’ same
P-Funk in my lap, I grab a pack and snort a line or two
Fuck what folk be sayin' mane, this is what I like to do
(?) is in this bitch, we out it fire. rollin’ heavy
Campaignin' like a motherfucker, riding in the Chevy

[Lil E sample] 7x
Ridin' in the Chevy, yes he also smoke the ink mane

[Verse 2: Playa Fly]
Ballin' down Orleans and we smokin’ on a blunt mane
Psycho P just scooped me up, now we ridin' Chevy thang
Windows tinted - don't look in it, plus we got the bumpin' back
Snoop he got that B-U-D, so we blaze a forty sack
Laid back Chevy lackin' bitches on my horn mane
Rollin' by the river side, holler at slang Pain
Gangsta V hit them dogs on the motherfuckin' hoe
Why you bring that fuckin' weed? Thought you bring that fuckin blow
For you bustas ridin' Chevy: keep them fuckin' doors locked
(?) knockin' off them socks for them motherfuckin' knots
Lil Diddy in this hoe, yeah he ridin' in da Chevy too
Purple thang, gold hammers, yeah you clean as hell fool
Now I'm out it fire, Noid is at my fuckin' side mane
Let that beat just ride for my niggas in them Chevy thangs

[Outro: Juicy J]
Yeah y'all know what time it is, Juicy J Volume 9
Sayin' what's up to Lil Fly, Poncho in the belts
Lil Laneson at the hide-away, Lil Noid drivin' the green chevy
Paul in that purple thang, Derrick in the blue chevy
It's on fool
Ah yeah can't forget about my nigga Pain
Ridin' in da chevy, smokin' the ink mane
Yeah y'all ride this in hell
