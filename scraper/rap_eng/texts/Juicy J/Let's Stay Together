[Intro: sample]
Everybody's breaking-breaking up
Let's stay together-gether-gether
Let's stay together-gether-gether-gether
Everybody's breaking-breaking up
Let's stay together-gether-gether
Let's stay together-gether-gether-gether

[Ludacris]
Yeah, tell y'all a lil' story right quick, right
Luda!

First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody done called it quits
Shit I thought Bobby and Whitney'd stay together forever
If they made it that long; I guess the drugs weren't that strong
And now it's Russell and Kimora, even Jordan and Juanita
And to top it off, Brad left Jen for Angelina?
What the hell is goin on in this world, this just can't be!
If Will and Jada can do it then why can't we?
Hillary's still with Bill Clinton, how do they do it?
He got his dick sucked and the whole damn WORLD knew it
Now Paul McCartney's losin half of his life
All because he got divorced from his wife
Somebody said it's cheaper to keep her, but not in K-Fed's case
Cause Britney even had to pay for K-Fed's case
Nick and Jessica, Trina and Wayne
And if you broke up wit'cha girl I know ya feelin the pain, because

[Hook: sample] + (Ludacris)
Everybody's breaking-breaking up
Let's stay together-gether-gether
(United we stand, divided we fall)
Let's stay together-gether-gether-gether
(United we stand, divided we fall, c'mon!)
Everybody's breaking-breaking up
Let's stay together-gether-gether
(United we stand, divided we fall)
Let's stay together-gether-gether-gether
(United we stand, divided we fall)

[Ludacris]
First it was Shaq and Kobe, then Iverson and Philly
T.O. and McNabb, even Game and 50
I guess sometimes you gotta let the past be the past
But I'd give a hundred thou' to see Jay with Dame Dash
B.G. with Lil Wayne, Juvenile and Turk
Mannie Fresh with Baby, how can we make it work?
Krunchie with Three-6, Diamond with Crime Mob
Lauren Hill with the Fugees, Remy with Terror Squad
Lil' Kim back with Cease, and Snoop with mo' Dre
Dre with mo' Big Boi, CD's with mo' play
What's Tribes with no Quest? Salt with no Pepa
Even the Eagles broke up and got the fuck back together!
Sellin millions of copies, and gettin that cash
And Raz B said Chris Stokes was gettin that ass
I don't even understand it, what the hell went wrong?
Maybe folks'll wise up and take heed to this song, because

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
I can't take it, no!

At first Wu-Tang broke up, now O.D.B. is gone
Then I'm hearin Cam'Ron don't talk to Jim Jones?
Who'da saw that shit comin? Certainly not me
Or the Dogg Pound break up, or Goodie Mo-B
Then Shawnna almost jumped ship from D.T.P
If Chingy left and came back then damnit, why can't she?
We gotta think it's all for one, and one for all
HIP-HOP! United we stand, divided we fall
So why is
