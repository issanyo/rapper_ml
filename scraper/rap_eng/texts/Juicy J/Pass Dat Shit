[Hook: Lord Infamous (DJ Paul)]
While you sitting there babysitting, conversating with the weed?
(Pass that shit, nigga pass that shit)
Man you fucking the rotation up, just pass the shit to me
(Pass that shit nigga, pass that shit)

[Verse 1: Frayser Boy]
It's puff puff, pass, the rules, they still the same
You need to pass the weed dog, you holdin' up the train
Done held the blunt so long, It's getting kinda small
The next blunt that get's rolled, bruh you won't hit it at all
Ain't put a dime on shit, nothin' but lips and finger-tips
Dog contribute to the session mane or you gon' have to dip
And go get in ya whip and lead y'all somewhere else
Shoulda smashed behind yo partner, bruh he already left

[Verse 2: Crunchy Blac]
Yeah, I smoke weed, that good-good dope
But I hate when niggas be, babysitting that dope
Yeah, I drink yo purple and rolled up Sweets
Take me two puffs then I pass that weed
But remember we on purple so we fall to fucking sleep
So I yelled at my nigga, pass me that green
Don't make me put my foot in yo ass knee-deep
Just do what the song say, nigga pass that weed

[Hook: Lord Infamous (DJ Paul)]
While you sitting there babysitting, conversating with the weed?
(Pass that shit, nigga pass that shit)
Man you fucking the rotation up, just pass the shit to me
(Pass that shit nigga, pass that shit)
Why you rest having the blunt when I put half up on them trees?
(Pass that shit nigga, pass that shit)
I see you one of them niggas that be tryna smoke for free
(Pass that shit nigga, pass that shit)

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
I can smell it in the air but where the hell's it coming from?
Need it badly, can I hit your blunt? Or simply take a gun?
Simply buy me up the hash and crumble purple-kushy, yum
Bubble-gum or onion, fuck all that man, I want me some
Put the torchy on the dope, just let me sit and have a smoke
Automatic gat, I grab it, just might have it, It's the choke
Know that you don't know me or don't owe me, don't be mean to me
Let a brother come on over and hit some of yo greenery

[Verse 4: Lil Wyte]
I'm gettin' tired of smokin' out with traitors
Non-chiefers and conservators
Constantly holdin' on to the weed while I'm tryna get my vapours
Fuck some papers, cigarillos what I like to roll and choke
Babysittin' motherfucka, keep on tokin' and get yo fingers broke
Pass that shit, I know it's the last hit
Lil Wyte gon' be blasted
Til' I'm hittin' my casket
You a grown man, wrong thang
Tryna hog the dope mane?
You wanna fuck with me without passin'
Just stick to cocaine, bitch!

[Verse 5: DJ Paul]
I'm chillin' with my nigga "Get High"
C-H-R-I, S, cause he always keep the best
And we in the woods
And we wish a motherfucka would
Come through, fuckin' off cause we on that good
Up all night, this cain's an upper, weed is a downer
Wit' them guns beside us, we starin' at them cameras
Steady smokin', watchin' porn on the flat-screen
With some bunnys from the platinum in my main ching

[Verse 6: Juicy J]
I'm on that weed and that Red-Bull and alcohol
That get you hype or slow you down, it's like a speed ball
But I can't stand when a nigga wanna roll it
Then (cough) and hold it
Hurry up and pass it before you get your ass kicked
I got a ounce of weed but you ain't reachin' in my plastic
It's sticky more than Taffy
It's finer than miss Halley, Berry
Call it blue-berry
I need some commisaries
