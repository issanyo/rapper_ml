[Hook]
Triple Six, Trip-Triple Six
Trip-Triple Six
Triple Six, Trip-Triple Six
Trip-Triple Six
Now I'm high, really high
Mane I'm about to shout
'Bout to run up in your house
Put that gun up in your mouth

Triple Six, Trip-Triple Six
Trip-Triple Six
Now I'm high, really high
Mane I'm about to shout
'Bout to run up in your house
Put that gun up in your mouth
Triple Six, Trip-Triple Six
Trip-Triple Six

[Verse 1]
I'm 'bout to bring back the old Three Six
Just like the 90's and the old three tricks
Mask and the Glock and the blow on deck
Nigga talking shit, better live by yo rep
Anybody know about the 1990's
All we did is shoot guns, start fighting
Smoke a lot of dope, snort a lot of coke
Nigga talking shit then his ass get choked
Lock a motherfucker in the trunk my nigga
[?] nigga body to the Mississippi river
Where is the bud, where is the bud
Where is the drugs, where all the drugs
I done put it in a blunt, I done smoked it up
Nigga from the streets getting so fucked up
But everybody talking about the old Triple Six
They still miss that old Triple Six
Nigga on the block go ham on a bitch
Nigga riding dirty in a ham on a bitch
Drugs in their car and a trunk on the seat
Drugs in their car and a trunk on the seat

[Hook]
Triple Six, Trip-Triple Six
Trip-Triple Six
Triple Six, Trip-Triple Six
Trip-Triple Six
Now I'm high, really high
Mane I'm about to shout
'Bout to run up in your house
Put that gun up in your mouth

Triple Six, Trip-Triple Six
Trip-Triple Six
Now I'm high, really high
Mane I'm about to shout
'Bout to run up in your house
Put that gun up in your mouth
Triple Six, Trip-Triple Six
Trip-Triple Six
