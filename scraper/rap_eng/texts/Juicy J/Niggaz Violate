[Hook]
They comin' through yo shit
This is serious
Niggas must be thinkin' Juicy J ain't that nigga rich
I will pay a nigga 20 racks to kick your kitchen in
Anybody wanna see you dead
You know they pitchin' in
Niggas violate I let them goons deal wit ya
I got the magazines and you can get your issue
You can get a head shot and I ain't talking pictures
Have ya six feet deep and your family gonna miss you
[Repeat]

[Verse 1]

They comin' through yo shit
This is serious
Niggas must be thinking Juicy J ain't that nigga rich
I will pay a nigga 20 racks to kick your kitchen in
Anybody wanna see you dead
You they know they pitchin in
Wanna know the goons in yo house I keep a solid 10
One of my guys on my killa team can be yo best friend
You missed a kid
Nigga I dont give a shit
Long as they catch yo ass
Smokin wit myself bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

They comin' down yo block
Lettin' dem chop a shot
Niggas should know ain't none good bout the world cross
Niggas shoulda known act a fool we'll blow your ass off
Niggas shoulda known I got some goon to kidnap like Saw
Walk up in yo room they got that tool to cut yo head off
You don't even wanna know the gun that cut two dreads off
Want it to yo face they gonna take the loaf of bread off
Don't you try to run or pull yo gun it's gon' get real sloppy
