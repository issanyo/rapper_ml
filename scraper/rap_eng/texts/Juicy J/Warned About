[Hook: Marka]
This is what they warned me about
Told me never duck down, so i ain gettin no lower
This is what she warned me about
Mama always told me keep my friends close but my enemies closer
This is what they warned me about i know
Gotta watch my back everywhere i go
This what warned me about
This is what they warned me about

[Verse 1: Yamine]
I've been warned about everything
I never ever listen now look at me
Using SoundTrap and Youtube for my beats
This ain't no real studio
I'm using my PC
This a broke figures life
Can't afford a studio
Can't afford that price
I hope my listeners are listening to this right
StoneTree Studios is right down the block
NBAYoungBoy ain't never rapped a part
Juicy J ain't never rapped a part
I took a couple hooks and acapella
So my raps can be abroad
I'm putting up the mic
And I'm never coming back
I'm focused on my future
Which didn't involve rap
No more beats, my friends stabbed me in my back
You talking about I'm corny
But your bars are wack
Do that!
Do that yeah do that

[Hook: Marka]
This is what they warned me about
Told me never duck down, so i ain gettin no lower
This is what she warned me about
Mama always told me keep my friends close but my enemies closer
This is what they warned me about i know
Gotta watch my back everywhere i go
This what warned me about
This is what they warned me about

[Verse 2: Yamine]
I'm tired of the lies
They never go away
One of these days people gonna catch me in my blaze
I mean my homie Darion he hoopin
And scoring every day
But when I come on the court I change the whole game
My momma told me to stop
Or I'm gon' get popped
I used to go to the studios to listen to my POPs
I never listen to the warnings
No w I'm freaking sinning
I'm losing every freaking day
And my haters is winning
Quit lying bout the hoes
Quit lying bout the shows
Quit lying bout the weed
You haven't smoked since you was born
I'm sorry for what I did
I can't have this no more
This is coming from my heart
Naw nigga my soul

[Hook: Marka]
This is what they warned me about

This what warned me about
