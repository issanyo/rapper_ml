In the back smoking drugs
Drugs in the da club, drugs in the club
Drugs in the da club, and you know we smoking loud, (kush)
Drugs in the da club, drugs in the club
Drugs in the da club, me and all my dawgs
Drugs in the da club, drugs in the club
Drugs in the da club
In the back smoking drugs
Drugs in the da club, and you know we smoking loud, kush
Drugs in the da club

We in this bitch like

I be fucking with the club
But if I can’t smoke, then I ain’t fucking with the club
Somebody better tell em they ain’t fucking with a scrub
When you see a real nigga, show a real nigga love
See all I do is hustle, got money in my duffle
How the fuck did I get Gucci symbols on my buckle?
They legalize weed and there won’t ever be a scuffle
If errybody smokin weed, won’t nobody tussle
So me I’m steady smoking, sippin like I’m smokin
I don’t give a fuck that’s why I’m smokin in the open
I got lil' mama scopin, and I think that bitch a whine
I don’t pull the line in my 20 years old wine
Bitches steady on, haters lookin' at me
All this balling I be doing, I should win an ESPY
Lil mama think I’m sexy, she says she wanna sex me
But she ain’t never met me
Well tell her she can catch me

VIP is where you find me at,
Higher than the seas on my private jet
4 door lambo, I’m buying that
I’m mad cause them bitches ain’t designed it yet
I’m smoking on loud, tell 'em bitches be quiet
If a nigga keep hating, he gon' make me start a riot
Could have bought a house but I spent it on a ride
And if I get any higher, I’ma really start flying
Tell me what you know about that Taylor Gang shit
We be poppin champagne just to pour it on a bitch
Leave the club with a girl I ain’t never gon' forget
She slop on my knob, but she don’t spit
Getting trippy as I wanna with my niggas out in Dallas
Look at juicy j, he ballin like the Mavericks
Me and all my niggas and a bunch of automatics
If a nigga run upon me, I’ma let the nigga have it
