Doping and whipping, a groupie ho on my dick
These hoes ain’t in love with me, they in love with my chips
No seat belt is strapped, but I gotta strap in my lap
Got rats comin for my cheese they gonna run across my trap
Money on your head but you ain’t gonna need a cap
Put your ass to sleep, take a permanent nap
I got plenty of tools, but I don’t play with them
I go to sleep with all my bitches, yeah I lay with them
Homie I’m always strapped, like a green beret
In my cup I got that lean, that’s that drink

Been up in here for four / five days, call me hood Hermit
Can't show no bread like Lenny on good times, had to burn him
