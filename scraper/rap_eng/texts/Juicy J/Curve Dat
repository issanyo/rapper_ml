Better curve that (Bitch)
Better not tell a bitch your biz
Better not show her where you live
Better curve that (Bitch)
Better not give that bitch no kids, better not give that bitch a break
Better curve that (Bitch)
Nigga you know she ain't shit, nigga you know she ain't shit
Better curve that (Bitch)
Nigga you know she ain't shit, nigga you know she ain't shit
Better curve that (Bitch)

[Verse 1]
Seen her at the club with her ass all out and her titties pushed up, god damn
Met her at the bar then you took her to your crib and y'all both crashed out on them Xans
Homie it's gon' to take a miracle for that bitch to be wifey material
Nah homie that ain't what it is
You wanna get that bitch a baby, you can't be for real
You cannot be serious, can't be thinking clearly
I've been tryna get you game, don't look like you hear me
Boy that pussy just done took over your mind
Now I guess this is what they mean when they say that love is blind

[Verse 2]
Look what you got into, this is what y'all got into
Caught you fucking off now she busting out your windows
This was suicidal like a Lincoln Continental
She cut up all your time now you gotta drive a rental
This what you want, nigga really you on child support court spending millions on them children
I tried to warn your ass, you weren't listening
If you was, you wouldn't be in this predicament
Baby mama drama, I'm not dealing with that shit
I'm not tryna make no babies, I'm just tryna get more rich
That's her baby daddy, he on child support
Now he working 40 hours just for juvenile
