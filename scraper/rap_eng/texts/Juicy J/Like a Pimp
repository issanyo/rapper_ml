[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Now I ain't Don Juan with the magic wa-wand
But I can break a bitch for the cheese and funds
I don't have to use a gun or even make the ho cum
If a nigga go to jail then a bitch make bond
While you shaking that ass in the shake ja-joint
I be sitting in the back, rolling big blun-blunts
Let me know when you off to collect my mon'
If a nigga can't get it then a nigga will haul
Cause playas like me don't see nothin' funny
Bitch better have my motherfucking money
Black eyes and bruisin up a face I done done it
To let her know these bonified pimps who run it
She make a G a night but she told me 200
But that's what I get fucking with a snow bunny
I told her like this, ain't the nigga you be calling
Police found a body that very next morning

[Hook: Juicy J]
Gator Boots and the suits is the clothes, like a pimp
Keep the money not folded in a roll, like a pimp
When I see you bitch you better have my dough, like a pimp
Reach back like a pimp and slap the ho

Gator Boots and the suits is the clothes, like a pimp
Keep the money not folded in a roll, like a pimp
When I see you bitch you better have my dough, like a pimp
Reach back like a pimp and slap the ho

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
They wanna wear my shoes, they wanna wear my clothes
They wanna ride round through the hood with 20 hoes
Sitting back in the back like a nigga suppose
With a chauffer driving, letting his pimpin' be choose
I can walk the walk and I can talk the talk
Bring yo girl to my room mane that's all you saw
Young nigga in the cut named Juicy J
Nigga skin black as dark like Ebay
All these freaks cross the world they don't want to holla
If you ain't got 20's, if you ain't got dollars
Bitch fuck that shit, we still gon' pimp
We go ride through the streets, we go hit the dense
We gon' smoke on them blunts, we gon' sip a fifth
We gon' stand on the corner with a pistol grip
If you want to holla at us, we ain't out for the squeeze
All we want is yo purse cause we out for the cheese

[Hook: Juicy J]
Gator Boots and the suits is the clothes, like a pimp
Keep the money not folded in a roll, like a pimp
When I see you bitch you better have my dough, like a pimp
Reach back like a pimp and slap the ho

Gator Boots and the suits is the clothes, like a pimp
Keep the money not folded in a roll, like a pimp
When I see you bitch you better have my dough, like a pimp
Reach back like a pimp and slap the ho

[Verse 3: La Chat]
1 little, 2 little niggas that's paying me
3 little, 4 little niggas eating pussy
I'ma keep it real, ain't no need of being in my grill
I'ma make you work, pimpin' dudes just to get a meal
Pimping don't play pay, what you fucking weigh
Yeah I got the knowledge and the skills on getting paid
Nigga wanna fuck but for what you ain't gave enough
Better hit the strip, slang dick cause a nigga bust
La Chat smokin on a sack like a real mack
Sitting back, countin' all my ends checking all traps
Claiming you won't go, that's a damn lie
You get got, I have you hypnotized
I don't even care, we can share in this game ho
Tossing these niggas for the dough is the way it go
Having niggas sick about the way that I did man
You should of told them I'm a real mutherfuckin pimp
