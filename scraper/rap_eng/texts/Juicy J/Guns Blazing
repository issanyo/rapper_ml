[Intro: Juicy J]
Higher than the seas on my private jet
Four door lambo, I'm buying that
I'm mad cause them bitches ain't designed it yet
I'm mad cause them bitches ain't designed it yet

[Verse 1: Demon The Devil]
Twenty four gold karat smartwatch
I got bitches at the crib with some big tots
Muthafucka I will hit you with the big Glock, if you keep on talking that little shit to the fat ops
I'm smoking purple lean, with my vros, high as a mother ship
Trying to have a good time, ignoring all of the bullshit
Playing games, spitting game, that's all we ever do
We're meant to kill shit, turnt up the party, Demon Gang that's the fuckin' crew
Speed up the limit, I'm finna fuck up your languages, going super saiyan all over the mic
Bring the lube home baby, your pussy is so tight
We finna fuck it up
Having sex all night
Acting all white knight
With a cup of purpp and a dab of Sprite
We gone be alright
Stop stressin' your mental
We gone be instrumental
As soon as we climax
We gone be so

[Bridge: Juicy J]
Higher than the seas on my private jet
Four door lambo, I'm buying that
I'm mad cause them bitches ain't designed it yet
I'm mad cause them bitches ain't designed it yet

[Verse 2: Demon The Devil]
I'm cruisin' down the hood in my gold '64
With my main bitch beside me and she ain't no hoe
All I want to do is smoke that grass, listening to Hov, but I swear these niggas acting tough, the streets, it ain't a joke
Niggas get hit with the MAC, in the back, inside of your Cadillac
BLAT-BLAT-BLAT
Stay strapped, or you gonna get clapped by some real ass niggas that finna go straight headshot
No kneecaps
Steal yo cheap hat
And cop me some rehab
Nah, I'm not mad, I stay GLAD
Don't test me fag, take a step back

[Outro: Demon The Devil]
Yeah, I'm that mean
Shoot up the function, let's make it fancy
Keep the guns blazing, we gone make it to a galaxy
I'll meet you in Hell, that's where you'll find me
