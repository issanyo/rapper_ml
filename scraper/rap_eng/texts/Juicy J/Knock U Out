[Intro: Juicy J]
Man I’m fucked up like a motherfucker mane

[Hook: Big KRIT]
This shit here will knock you out, knock you out
This shit here will knock you out, knock you out
This shit here will knock you out, knock you out
Slow it down, pass it round, fuck a dub, blow a pound

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Smoking on that medical, that mean the weed is clinical
Better yet it’s critical, weed shops, I buy the store
I’m so off the ground, half way through a pound
Ricky Bobby baby I would never slow down
When you hit the bong, yeen gon' hear a sound
What I’m sippin, got me tripping, limpin in the building
Blue dream my bag right, load it up with that get right
When I’m on that purp sack, juicy j be so light
Zig Zag paper, king size, bad bitch, green eyes
Roll me up and get me high, she’s snorting blow to keep her energized
Twistin' and sippin', got me fucking up misses
In a hotel 3 hoes lickin' and kissin'

[Hook: Big KRIT]
This shit here will knock you out, knock you out
This shit here will knock you out, knock you out
This shit here will knock you out, knock you out
Slow it down, pass it round, fuck a dub, blow a pound
This shit here will knock you out, knock you out
This shit here will knock you out, knock you out
This shit here will knock you out, knock you out
What’s the deal, pop a pill, drink some syrup, how you feel?

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
This that shit that got these rappers high
Juicy J be faded, you can see it in his eyes
New trippy cartridge, middle finger to the sky
I’m probably gonna smoke a million pounds before I die
Weed man just dipped, tell him bring it back
I just smoked a zip and I need another pack
Box of blunts for breakfast, edibles for snacks
The weed gonna stop but I ain’t got another rack
More money, more trees, all out, no seeds
Kush wax, no bees, smoking loud, overseas
Zip lock, full of dank, that’s what a nigga need
Face looking like Chinese, your baby mama she eyeing me
