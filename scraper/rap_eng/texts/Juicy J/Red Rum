Red Rum! (x4)

[Project Pat]
A .44 bullet shell took my niggas life
Triggers pulled by some young niggas on that white
He used to fuck with them boys on the weed tip
They found my nigga dead, face down in a ditch
I saw that shit on the news just the other day
I ain't for singing no blues, I'mma make 'em pay
I know them bitches, they be hanging at the Shake Junt
I catch 'em slipping, coming out and commence to pump
Been led, leave 'em dead on the fucking scene
Throw them out in a steamer, make the getaway clean
I made a block then I switched to the other ride
I'm still in shock cause I just did a homicide
I executed me some punks that deserved it
They had a warrant for they death, so I served it
I gave them tricks a little dose of they medicine
I bet them hoes, man'll never try that shit again

(red Rum!)
Most of y'all wanna see some blood spilling anyway
(red Rum!)
Bodies fall, niggas dying young on this everyday
(red Rum!)
Laid to rest, must've been your time for you to clock out
(red Rum!)
Had a vest, but you should've had your fucking Glock out

[Project Pat]
In the streets, niggas die, they got fried, cause they tried
Tested game of the man who's committing homicides
Suicide, would be better for you fools
But I'll be damned if I don't
Help you out like the "duck, forty" and, see I can
And I'm willing to proceed with a killing
Stick a gauge up your anus, do a crime, make it heinous
Aim this anger to my chamber, let a slug through that talk
Cause I'm on a bloody stalk, putting suckers in the chalk
Walk the walk, get your game, guns click, it's whatever, nigga
I ain't barrin' shit, so you know whatever's clever, nigga
Trigger-happy, nappy-headed, set it; I shall peel some
Motherfuckers cap when I roll with the shotgun
Project pop one of you niggas trying to steal my shit
Fuck with me and mine and I swear it's a murder, bitch
Yeah, I see you niggas mean-mugging on them porches
Unload that thang, watch 'em scatter like roaches
