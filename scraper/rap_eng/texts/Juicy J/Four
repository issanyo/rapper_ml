[Spoken intro]

[Verse 1]
Said that she insecure, I just threw insurance
She hit the mainstage, now she feels important
My money foreign, all I hear's important
Plastic bag full of cash, watch Juicy pour it
We love the king of diamonds, and she still countin'
We smoking dope, she on the mountain
I've been rollin' hard, [?] water fountain
I just be lodging, booty club spender
I was fucking strippers, oh, we drop spinners
Juicy gettin' bored, Juicy got whores
Valet pay attention, here's some shit you can't afford
Four hoes, we fucking, don't knock on my door

[Hook]
Juicy gettin' bored, Juicy got whores
Juicy gettin' bored, Juicy got whores
Ju-Ju-Juicy gettin' bored, Juicy got whores
Juicy gettin' bored, Juicy got whores

[Verse 2]
Tryna play good girl, used to be a bad bitch
She work too hard, you can hear it in her accent
Said her name, Erica, but the club call her Passion
Titties look new, cute face, and her ass massive
That way that her body shake, it's gon' be a lot to handle
Baby foreign like the Lambo, worldwide
Not a place she ain't seen, love molly and hate beans
Suck dick and make green, we fuck some and sip lean
Trippy's stripper chick, I can change your whole life
Money, drugs and Sprite, and I gave that bitch pipe
For one night, you can play the wife
I bend that thing over, do whatever that I like

[Hook]
Juicy gettin' bored, Juicy got whores
Juicy gettin' bored, Juicy got whores
Ju-Ju-Juicy gettin' bored, Juicy got whores
Juicy gettin' bored, Juicy got whores
Let's get it!
