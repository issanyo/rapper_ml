[Intro: Common]
I realize, I am the hopeful black woman who was denied her right to vote
I am the caring white supporter killed on the front lines of freedom
I am the unarmed black kid who maybe needed a hand, but instead was given a bullet
I am the two fallen police officers murdered in the line of duty
We look to the future and we want to create a better world
Now is the time to change the world

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
God bless America, home of the brave
We ain't picking cotton no more but we're still slaves
They talk about peace, but how that's gon' be
When police leaving young niggas dead in the street
When niggas start shooting back, how they gon' act
And they wonder why a nigga stay strapped
They wonder why we trap, for real, real niggas don't rat
Black man, born with a target on his back
Standing with his hands up, screaming "Don't shoot!"
Biggest gang in America, the boys in blue
Now we gon' ride, now we gon' loot
Cause that black man could have been me or you

[Hook]
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Fuck the police, like Cube & Eazy-E
A nigga pay taxes and still ain't free
We just trying to get rich and ball out
Looks like the pigs trying to take us all out
We don't get justice, we just get handcuffed
They don't want to see a nigga get his bands up
Crooked judge just handing out sentences
Cause we're guilty until proven innocent
Standing with our hands up, screaming "Don't shoot!"
Biggest gang in America, the boys in blue
Damn right we gon' ride and we gon' loot
Cause that dead black man could have been close to you
