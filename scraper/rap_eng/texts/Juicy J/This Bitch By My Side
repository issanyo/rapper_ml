[Verse 1: Juicy J]

I got a main bitch (Mhm), I got a new ho (Mhm)
Love my AK, and I bought a 44 (You know it!)
She so seductive way she takes them clothes off (That bitch!)
Nigga get wrong then that bitch is going off
It's her birthday so I bought that bitch a bean (My ho!)
She my inspiration (I know!), so I let her sing (My ho!)
Had a let her go cause she wasn't working right (This mine!)
Had to pull my side bitch cause she was working right
Why you mad at me? She the one taking yo life (Uh-huh!)
Taking your money, taking your jewelry
Puttin' these niggas on ice (Alright!)
She fine (she fine!), she mine (she mine!)
Ask what size she wear (Uh-huh!), she'a tell ya' nine

[Hook: Juicy J x2]
This bitch on my side, all she like to do is licks
This bitch on my side, she a take a nigga bricks
This bitch on my side, on my side err night
Anybody get wrong she gon get they ass right

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
If I pull her off my hip, then you know I'm bout to squeeze
If you see me with my girl then you know you better leave (Bro!)
Just bought the extender, you can't find a better weave
Better watch what you say cause that drama you don't need
Dress her ass up, and I watch make that ass clap [clap 8x]
All the actin' that you doin', that shit over bruh
It's a wrap [wrap 8x]
I got goons I don't call em' (Hell naw!), if I got a problem (Hell naw!)
My old lady solve em spot a hater then off em
Take your money like offer (Ho!), all this money I'm profit (Ho!)
See a snitch then off em (Ho!) put that nigga in a coffin (Ho!)
