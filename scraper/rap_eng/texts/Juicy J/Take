[Hook: Juicy J]
You say your taking what, you must go take whats coming with it
For you thinking about taking something, you must go take whats coming with it
Nigga you ain't taking shit, unless you take whats coming with it
Tryna rob me for my money, got the nuts to come and get it

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Caught you sleeping with the 12 gauge
Whats it with the guy heard you paid
Heard shit nigga robbing dope boys
When another tryna cover up yo face
Niggas thinking that they can violate
Niggas say they real, but they really ain't
Now the gun pointed at you bruh
Now you wanna run, but you really can't
Nigga that's what you should have thought about
Before robbing niggas going buck wild
Tryna get my guy for half a bird
Round of a goons then you send em out
Then you get high for 2 weeks
Your boy tell me where me all yo niggas be
No you ain't forgot, you from Memphis Ten
Where the color throw shit, move daily
I shot the boy in his back, put the gauge to his head
Told the boys nothing personal, I just came to break bread
20 racks and you dead
You should have packed up and fled
But you chose to meet Mr.Goon, young nigga masked up [?]

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
You just put a move, but you don't understand
I find out where you lay yo head, I'ma get you man
You just put a move, but you don't understand
I find out where you lay yo head, I'ma get you man
Now I ain't saying nigga like me can't get caught
Pulling up, I come from inside of yo house, [?]
Late night through the glass with a fightster
Ducking from the windshield glass, I'm your nightmare
You reap what you sow, nigga you can call me karma
You stepped away with 2 cases, stepped into some drama
Blood with drugs, in this drama [?] night
Get yo head blown off in front of kids and wife
You know my motto, my nigga and it don't change
You [?]
