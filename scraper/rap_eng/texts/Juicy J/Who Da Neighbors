[Intro]
We trippy mane!
Who? Who? Who? Who?

[Hook x2]
My mansion sittin' on 40 acres
Who the neighbors? Who?!
Kobe Bryant from the Lakers
Now that's paper, who?!
Kobe Bryant from the Lakers
Now that's paper, who?!
Kobe Bryant from the Lakers
Now that's paper, woah!

[Verse 1]
Big cribs lot of cars and enormenous prices
Ain't gon' tell you what I spend but my plug might
Get money, get pussy, smoking weed forever, yessirr!!
Rub that money in my palms cause it grease better, yessirr!!
Whole real estate came with a lot of zeros
How you do that mayne?
Sold to a lot of people, over 30 million sold, that's a lot of people
Now I got a big crib that fit a lot of people

[Verse 2]
Straight from the projects, now I ride Maserati, mhm!
The life of a mob nigga, I think I'm John Gotti, mhm!
Bank statement proof I buy what I chose
I take 40 racks and I throw it out and I’m cool
Got all these thirsty bitches think I’m going pay ‘em
This dick you can but money you gets nay
No need for wristband, the owner know who I am
10 bottles of Rosé, 2 models on both hands
