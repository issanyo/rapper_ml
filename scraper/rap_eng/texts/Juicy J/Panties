[Hook: Jeremih]
Got a lil bitch that like it rough
Got a lil bitch that like it pro
She love to tare it off
She love to tare it off
Know I'm tryna fuck right with you, babe
Know I'm tryna fuck right with you, babe
Show me it's your stage
Show me it's your stage
Got a check, we could pour 'em up
Only if you lose your panties
Then she storm up
Only if you lose your panties
Had to throw a lil' something on her wrist
Diamonds made her lose her panties
She know what time it is
It's time to lose them panties

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
It's time to lose them panties, hope they ain't no grannies
It's time to celebrate 'cause I just came back from the Grammy's
Hope I don't forget tonight, I'm mixin' Act with Xannies
Throw a couple hundred in and there go them panties wow
And she got it from her momma, I wanna meet the family
The way she climbin' on that pole, then she bust it on the floor
Make me wanna throw some more, this bitch runnin' through the door
Wanna treat her like a track meet in the backseat of my Roll's
Got enough hundreds on me to buy all of these hoes
She say she new to this shit but she twerk like a pro
Your bitch was plottin' on me when I came through the door
Make her bust that pussy up until this bitch close

[Hook: Jeremih]
Got a lil bitch that like it rough
Got a lil bitch that like it pro
She love to tare it off
She love to tare it off
Know I'm tryna fuck right with you, babe
Know I'm tryna fuck right with you, babe
Show me it's your stage
Show me it's your stage
Got a check, we could pour 'em up
Only if you lose your panties
Then she storm up
Only if you lose your panties
Had to throw a lil' something on her wrist
Diamonds made her lose her panties
She know what time it is
It's time to lose them panties

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Now this bitch closed, she puttin' back on her clothes
Hop up on the Roll's, she puttin' coke up her nose
Ain't (?) for this hoe, anything finna go
Pull up to the crib, she ask me what I gross
Takin' off her clothes before she get to the door
I'm fuckin' her on the bar, mixin' Henny with the Rose
As soon as I'm done with her I'mm pass her to my bro
I tell him be careful with her, you don't wanna overdose
You bitches callin' you hoes, tell your bitches to quit it
All my niggas official, that ain't even an issue
Her ass fat is delicious, nigga how could I missed it?
But as soon as I'm finished with you, tell your nigga come get you
Get your panties off the floor, nigga come and get your hoe
You can come and say your bitch gon' be waitin' by the door
Wow oh wow wow oh wow
What you need you? a cab? (or your ass a little change?)
Still playing these bitches (and the game ain't changed)
