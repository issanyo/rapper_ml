[Hook]
We used to ride around in steamers man
Now we pull up back to back in Beamers man
We used to live up in the trap house
Now I got a mansion I can trap out
We used to live up in the trap house
Now I got a mansion I can trap out
I can trap out
Now I got a mansion I can trap out

[Verse 1]
Yeah I push beats, yeah I push keys
I need at least 50 G's every time I touch a beat
Still use my face in the street
Still got that base in the street
I know you like the way the beat rock
That's the heat rock, no sheetrock
Ballin' out in my gymnasium
They out of bounds, I don't play with them
Acting brand new, I ain't saving them
The ones I used to dream about, I have my way with them
I'ma let 'em in the club, I'ma pay for them
Heard they wasn't doin' good, I'ma pray for them

[Hook]

We used to live up in the trap house
Now I got a mansion I can trap out
I can trap out
Now I got a mansion I can trap out

[Verse 2]
Beamed up, fresh, clean cut
Pour the lean up, mix the beans up
Beam up, roll the dream up
She thought she saw Jesus but she saw us
Boss up, boss up, boss up
Floss up, floss up, floss up
Sauce up, sauce up, sauce up
Cough up, cough up, cough up
That's when you know you got it
All these hoes exotic, all these hoes exotic
And they fully loaded, like an automatic
What if I never got it?
Remember if it ain't 'bout dough I probably done forgot it
Don't forget
