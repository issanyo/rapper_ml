[Intro]
Man when these niggas get under pressure, they will snitch on you I don't give a fuck if you've been knowing these niggas all your life. Y'all grew up--- that shit don't mean shit. Niggas ain't real mane

[Chorus]
These niggas screaming all that real shit, but under pressure niggas fold
You niggas some hoes (mhm)
You niggas screaming all that killa shit but under pressure niggas fold (mm)
You niggas some hoes (they some hoes)
You the type to tell some
Tell some (they snitchin')
You the type to tell some
Tell some (they tellin')
You the type to tell some
Tell some (they snitchin')
You the type to tell some
Tell some (they tellin')

[Verse 1]
Oh we know you told you done sold your soul
Working with the devil for that pot of gold
Say you on parole, got em for the low
I should have my little nigga come through and kick ya door
You the type to tell, cause you scared as hell
That I used to have a choppa on me and a scale
See I got a couple partners waitin' on they bail
That'll knock the meat up out your taco with these shells
See we ain't on that hoe shit, tell em' we don't know shit
Yo name all up in that paperwork you couldn't hold it
See these niggas just like lawn chairs they just keep on foldin'
Keep talking how them niggas hit you up and keep on rollin'

[Chorus]
These niggas screaming all that real shit, but under pressure niggas fold
You niggas some hoes (man they some hoes)
You niggas screaming all that killa shit but under pressure niggas fold (mm)
You niggas some hoes (they some hoes)
You the type to tell some
Tell some (they snitchin')
You the type to tell some
Tell some (they tellin')
You the type to tell some
Tell some (they snitchin')
You the type to tell some
Tell some (they tellin')

[Verse 2]
Word round' town you doin' a whole lot of talkin'
Nigga you ain't heard? You gon' wake up in a coffin
Word round' town you doin' a whole lot of snitchin'
Nigga you ain't heard? You gon' wake up in one of them ditches
Leave em' missin' in the river we call that sendin' em' fishin'
Got a couple dirty bitches in my kitchen doing dishes
Make a couple hunnit thou, leave a lil' bit for my misses
Tell that bitch don't do no talkin' you just sit back and just listen'
I can show you how to get that bag and show you how to flip it
Pay attention to the game, they would die for the way we livin'
You can't even have a nigga round' on a mission
Niggas snitchin' on they own, got to stay up out of prison
Damn!

[Chorus]
These niggas screaming all that real shit, but under pressure niggas fold
You niggas some hoes (mhm)
You niggas screaming all that killa shit but under pressure niggas fold (mm)
You niggas some hoes (they some hoes)
You the type to tell some
Tell some (they snitchin')
You the type to tell some
Tell some (they tellin')
You the type to tell some
Tell some (they snitchin')
You the type to tell some
Tell some (they tellin')

(Outro: Juicy J and DJ Blak)
I'm tellin' you mane, you gotta watch these niggas mane. I'm tellin' you bruh, they ain't who they say they is... Or who they claim to be. You gotta trust yourself man, you wanna do anything, get something done, just do it yourself. Fuck a nigga. They talkin' too much
It's so simple, stop snitching, stop lyin', stop being a bitch out there man. All you gotta do is stay in your lane. DJ Blak, Juicy J. Rules of the game are simple baby. Fix your face my nigga, if you don't know what I'm talkin' bout
