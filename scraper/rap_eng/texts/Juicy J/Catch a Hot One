You can catch a hot
You can catch a hot one
You can catch a hot
You can catch a hot one
You can catch a hot

Strapped bitch
Yea I'm strapped bitch with the AK

[Verse 1]
I never told on a nigga, did the crime did the time
Never folded on my niggas, did a line, shot the nine
I dont need a charge partner from my hand sold the crack
Lookin for a pound of good see my mans in the back
Of the projects, Cypress Garden where the biss at
You get caught slippin put some bullets up in your back
North memphis nigga nigga know how we flex it out
My dogs in the bay so afraid to keep them pockets out
Im about dead presidents talk's irrelevant
Get your head blowed off thats how we gon settle it
Did time on fourth floor stood on niggas
Three K's under the bed man Im good on triggas

You can catch a hot
You can catch a hot one

Strapped bitch
Yea I'm strapped bitch with the AK

[Verse 2]
Some of these suckas think im slippin but I really ain't
I always keep the ratchet on me to keep off the hands
The haters or the suckas you can call them what you wanna
I just got off of paper so im back on marijuana
I wanna be the boss the only way to do is to take it
I find you stealing from me playa I can't let you make it
You niggas see I came up when I was outta jail
The man up above showed me love it never failed
A drought on street music now it's time to get rich
You niggas out here with that ?? end up in a ditch
The K will spray like a water hose on a snitch
Bullets flying niggas dying like the wicked witch

[Hook]
You can catch a hot
You can catch a hot one
You can catch a hot

You can catch a hot
You can catch a hot one
Strapped bitch
Yea I'm strapped bitch with the AK

[Verse 3]
Never back down dont accept defeat nigga
If they knock you down jump right back on your feet nigga
When they talk beef stay strapped with that heat nigga
To hell with rapping we can settle this in the street nigga
Cause I dont sleep nigga Ima say you will do it
You got a hard head and Ima put some steel to it
I squeeze the trigga blood splatter on the windshield
Broad daylight it'll happen on this battlefield
Ima tell ya how I feel cause lames seek for it
A nigga will kill dont make me reach for it
Cause if I reach for it nigga ima use it
You suckas talk murda punk Ima do it

[Hook]
You can catch a hot
You can catch a hot one
You can catch a hot
You can catch a hot one
You can catch a hot
You can catch a hot one
Strapped bitch
Yea I'm strapped bitch with the AK
