[Verse 1: Koopsta Knicca]
I got a plan in command on your ass, bitch
This little short young niggas in them caskets
You bein' front black nigga rolled up layed up on your ass, ho
Peter-rolled by Koopsta, Crunchy, Juice, Paul, Boo and Scarecrow
Oh there's a whole lotta demons in my world today
Which means you run into a nigga like Koop, a nutcase
Here I can tell by tha day it's gonna be a long night
When I take a swipe for yo life, my big black butcher knife
Now while I'm kickin' niggas fiendin' just to kill 'em, though
Before I go and chief them Swishaz with them Navajos
Upon tha mighty Mississippi, bow can I fuckin' kick it?
You better answer quick before I hit you for them riches

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Punk ass niggas wanna really try to jump up but they know they gonna catch a couple of my sub-machine gun fire to they jaws
I kick shit flyin' through tha air, you wanna dare to test me, I am the Infamous nightmare, I wanna break some laws
I practice secret forms of voodoo culture
Dead flesh sculpture for my pet vultures
Sleepin' in tha death defying beyond human measurements
Into my private temple in tha middle of Mount Everest
Smokin' pine as I sky dive off of mountains
In my mind blood squirtin' high out of fountains
Countin' corpses in my black fortress
In tha hallway painting satanic portraits

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
See it was me, Lil' Buck, and my nigga Lil' Knife
And some thug ass fool I never seen in my life
We roll in Bobby's 'Lac with tha gold bones and vogues
Full grain, cloth top, sturdy pullin' them hoes
The nigga that I didn't know said he had some on a weed
And stoppin' by tha crib so he can get up on some cheese
I've smelled shit in the game as soon as he opened his mouth
We dropped him off, da fool went behind tha fuckin' house
I didn't think shit about it but some minutes had to pass
Made me really not trust his busta ass
I looked around and somethin' just made my eye switch
Twenty mo niggas dressed just like a bitch
Not takin' no chances I'm knowin' it's a stick up
But when we tried to bail we got blocked by a pickup
Dropped tha fools tryin to test my pimpin' to see what I'm all about
But speakin' too soon, I got blasted when I stepped up out da Cadillac
Vision blur I'm seein' 9-9
I was up on my back seein' a 6-6 up on a street sign
Lil' Buck slammed right into them durves
Made a U and scooped me as I cross straight to tha curb
My nigga Lil' Knife let tha Tech start rippin' me
From tha last hoes who still stood on they feet
Now we gettin' tha fuck up out of the hood
That was all wrong but takin some lifes made it right
It was a long night

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
It was a long night when I was locked down in 201
Back against tha wall smokin a square cuz it ain't no fun
Watchin' niggas fight over phone calls, gettin' buck
Knowin' when they get they life sentence man they ass stuck
Niggas always nervous cuz they servin bustas with a swords
Pullin' tha real killaz, GD's, Crips and Vice Lords
Lower level ain't a joke, a nigga got his neck broke
Thrown to tha ground like a bitch pickin' up tha soap
But I wasn't goin' cause a nigga like me kept a shank
If a fool stepped to me his face'll be in tha paint
Waitin' for a guard talkin' smart, it'll be a fight
In 201 locked down it was a long ass night

[Verse 5: Lord Infamous]
We call up the Devil's nights
I walked down tha hallway where tha walls are lined with candle lights
Sacrificin' doom when you enter tha Triple 6 gun room
Soon I will choose tha weapon I find most appropriate
For reasons I take tha Smith & Wesson and a Mac 10
Paul walked in he grabbed a street sweeper, Grim Reaper and a Glock 19
Crunchy Black he took tha goddamn M-16
Buck called up Koopsta, told him to get tha shovel ready for burial of the bodies
Lets put them on Unsolved Mysteries
Ease please creep up in tha trees with tha night scope
Inhaling on a blunt of Cambodian red dope
Them niggas died in a blast we stuck they gas in
Motha fuckin' Triple 6 assassins
