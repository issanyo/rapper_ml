[Intro: Juicy J]
Ne-Yo, tell me 'bout it man, let's go

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
You know the type, a different star every night
Been fetching the groupie, she fall in love with the lights
Lavish things like diamonds and furs, she make you pay the price
Get it while you can, pimping is just an advice

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
Shawty get up on, yeah, shawty get up on this from
Ending relationships, shawty searching the flash
'Til the stars end up coming to get ya
She bad enough to make you write a number on the back of your girlfriend's picture

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
She got a walk like she stalking prey
Them killer curves and that pretty face
And she gon' make you do what you say
Look at them legs, swinging them hips as she come your way
You better run, run for your life
Oh you better run, run for your life

[Verse 3: Ne-Yo]
Shawty getting thrill
Shawty getting thrill from making a nigga bank, yeah
Set 'em up, turn 'em out, knock 'em down, it's just that simple
Shawty make love like a drug, oh shawty go straight to the temple

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
She got a walk like she stalking prey
Them killer curves and that pretty face
And she gon' make you do what you say
Look at them legs, swinging them hips as she come your way
You better run, run for your life
Oh you better run, run for your life

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
My nigga, run for your life, can't turn no hoe to a wife
She just a gold digging bitch, do anything for some ice
For some bags or some heels she fuck whomever she gotta
She looks so good in a dress but you know what they say, the devil wears Prada
[?]
Take everything you own then she be right up out the door
Then it's on to the next, nigga dumber than you
Look mama, play with your mind, dunno why you be playing a fool
My nigga, run for your life, can't turn no hoe to a wife
My nigga, run for your life, can't turn no hoe to a wife

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
You better run, run for your life
Oh you better run, run for your life
