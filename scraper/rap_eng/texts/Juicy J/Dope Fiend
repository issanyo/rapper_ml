[Intro: Juicy J & DJ Squeeky]
Trippy vibes mane
Ain't nothin' wrong with smokin' a little weed mane
This bud keep me fiending mane just like a junkie
Ain't nothin' wrong with that shit mane
Listen to that music nigga
This bud keep me fiending mane just like a junkie
That's some trippy vibes right there bro
This bud keep me fiending mane just like a junkie
Man (808 Mafia)
This bud keep me fiending mane just like a junkie
This about gettin' high man

[Chorus]
I got bars of the xannies
I got jars like candy
I keep a pack like I'm Manny
And I know shit so don't stand me
Plug, thug
Blocks, floods
Dope, bud
Coke, mud
I got bars of the xannies
I got jars like candy
I keep a pack like I'm Manny
And I know shit so don't stand me
Plug, thug
Blocks, floods
Dope, bud
Coke, mud

[Verse]
I got bars like Rikers Island
Where I'm from, them niggas wilin'
I got bread, that dough be pilin'
I get high, I need a pilot
Know the plug like an extension
I know shit that I can't mention
I make money like an invention
And I'm free like O.J. Simpson
You need that shit, I got plenty
My trap be boomin' like penny
I need it all, every penny
My [?] fat, never skinny
Been knew that I had it in me
I took the heart away, penny
Couple codeine, that shit finna hit me
Lean, lean, promethazine
Pineapple
Crush, a Cream Soda
Don't shake it up
I'm stuck, I can't get up
Dope fiend, dreams in my cup
Ambulance, so g roll up
Lookin' for me, I'm high, look up (808 Mafia)
No such thing as too much

[Chorus]
I got bars of the xannies
I got jars like candy
I keep a pack like I'm Manny
And I know shit so don't stand me
Plug, thug
Blocks, floods
Dope, bud
Coke, mud
I got bars of the xannies
I got jars like candy
I keep a pack like I'm Manny
And I know shit so don't stand me
Plug, thug
Blocks, floods
Dope, bud
Coke, mud

[Outro: DJ Squeeky]
Bud keep me fiending mane just like a junkie
This bud keep me fiending mane just like a junkie
This bud keep me fiending mane just like a junkie
This bud keep me fiending mane (808 Mafia) just like a junkie
This bud keep me fiending mane just like a junkie
This bud keep me fiending mane just like a junkie
This bud keep me fiending mane just like a junkie
