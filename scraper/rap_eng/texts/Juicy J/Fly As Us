[Intro: Juicy J]
Play me some pimpin' mayne
[As I look back on the days that's gone by
I can't help but to think what would I have done
Different than I did at that time]
(Bei Maejor)
(See baby all I'm asking is for
Just a little bit of assistance, you know?)

[Hook: Bei Maejor]
Showing up, ain't nobody fly as us
(Who else you know look like this, pull up like this baby, with your fly self)
We pouring up, ain't nobody high as us
(See what I'm trying to get you to understand is very simple baby, we the best)
Up to the stars and the skies with you baby
Hanging with stars, girl look where you are
We just gotta keep on
Pouring up, ain't nobody high as us
(What I'm trying to get you to understand is very simple, we the best baby)

[Verse 1: Berner]
Weed lit, she's camera shy
Them crazy lips, crazy eyes
I'm fitted up, I'm extra fly
She copped the Porsche and let me drive
I'm on one, new chrome, that candy paint with that roof gone
This weed I got is just too strong
She like it raw with her boots on
I'm making moves on this boost phone
Twenty bottles, I'mma spray the crowd
She hanging around with that empty glass
Doing anything just to taste the loud
I'm smoked out, bottles up
Eighty thou', who ball like us
I want some money and she wanna fuck
I told her keep the watch, I want the truck
Choose me, that's 20 plus, lots of cash
Plenty drugs, diamonds rings, Persian rugs
Got a ice cold heart, girl, it's in my blood
I'm a O.G. cat from around the way
Countin' big money, my kind of thing
I got white girls, Asian girls, and Latin girls givin' cashin' me
Out

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Fuck niggas hate it but I get love from the ladies
They just sitting and waiting on cashing out, I'm on the ladies
I can't talk about weed, cause a nigga stay high
I can talk about them bands, I really live that life
Scared money, don't get money
If it ain't about money, that shit just funny
Block hot for us right, model for my wife
Ain't trickin' if you got it, you can have what you like
I got bands like the House of Blues, Loui V. my favorite shoes
All my bitches, they come in two's
Watch what you say or do
Soul gone like David Ruffin
Hustle game like Warren Buffet
Codeine with the jolly ranchers
You broke niggas drinking Robitussin
