(Hook, Lil' Flip)
Three, two, one, go!

And you don't want drama with the Clover G clique, yeah!
Three, two, one, go!
I'ma let'chu know, these rap niggas hoes
Look you don't wanna fake
Cause I'll break yo shiiit
And you don't want drama with the Three-6 clique, bitch!

(Verse 1, DJ Paul)
See nigga, this dope is cut-less
Flippin iron n' weight out my black Cutlass (Cutlass)
Shiny paint, with the quarter-top rag (Rag)
Got it for cheap, but we can't brag (Can't brag)
Haters playin, but they better have a plan-B
I got a Glock everytime that they see me
And I'ma bust til' my clips out of business
And that won't be til' I down all that witnessed
See I'ma do you bitches clean, by the book
With no murder weapons or talkers, then I'm good
See I ain't no trouble maker, just love to smoke wood
But'chu Three-6 wanna-be's got me mis-understood, bitch!

(Hook)

(Verse 2, Juicy J)[Left! repeats on beat throughout verse]
Yes sir
When you make a little cheese, then these niggas start to hate
For just rappin, or a jackin, or a dealer pushin weight
Don't get mad at the Juice, cause I hustle til' it's late
And you somewhere passed out, wit'cha face off in a plate
Heard you never get no pussy, so you hold 'em down and rape
Ridin 'round in rental-cars, like you head of the state
Tryin'a cut niggas deals, in the trunk he got the ba-kin soda
Thought I told ya, he'll get'cha cause he fake
Since I rap, don't be thinkin I can't leave yo body stinkin
Yes, we do a lot of drugs and a whole lot of drinkin
In this business, yeah it's gangsta
But this hatin, I'm gon' finish
Hit'chu in yo fuckin mouth, send you back to the dentist (Nigga!)

(Hook)
