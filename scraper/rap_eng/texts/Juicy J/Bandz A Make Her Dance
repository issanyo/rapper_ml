Strippers
Mike-Will-Made-It

Bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance
Bandz a make her dance

[Hook]
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I’m just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin’, and they ain’t using hands

[Hook]
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I’m just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin’, and they ain’t using hands

[Verse 1]
Short hair like Nia Long, loose ones she don’t need a loan
Start twerking when she hear her song, stripper pole her income
We get trippy and then some, so nasty when she rollin’
She put that ass up in my hands, I remote control it
She give me dome when the roof gone, at the KOD she leave with me
She got friends, bring three, I got drugs, I got drinks
Bend it over, Juicy J gon' poke it like wet paint
You say no to ratchet pussy; Juicy J can't
Racks er'where, they showin' racks, I'm throwing racks
In the VIP, rubber on I’m stretching that
Rich niggas tippin, broke niggas lookin
And it ain't a strip club if they ain't showin pussy

[Hook]
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I’m just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin’, and they ain’t using hands

[Hook]
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I’m just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin’, and they ain’t using hands



[Verse 2]
Down in Atlanta, 'bout to hit up Magic
Throw some money in the air all the bad bitches gon' grab it
Straight off the floor she gon' need a couple of bags
Like a broke ATM I'ma spill in all this cash
Them niggas in the club don’t be spending shit
20 stacks in one night, I be on trippy shit
My cribs paid off, but I’m still paying rent
A couple of condos paid, she lovin’ every cent
She make that ass clap, dancin' like she on a dick
Bring it back I threw a stack, that's one lucky bitch
Up and down she’s going she’s sliding on that pole
Making money, stacking them honey, shawty go

[Hook]
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I’m just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin’, and they ain’t using hands

[Hook]
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I’m just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin’, and they ain’t using hands
