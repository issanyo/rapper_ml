She in Love with the doe, nigga
I ain't got no Love for no hoe, nigga
She in love with the gold, nigga
I ain't got no Love for no gold digger
Hundred bottles in the club, all gold nigga
I be with the Thugs, stone cold killers
Say you know The Plug, I'm like so nigga?
Still got them drugs in the flow nigga

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I got bottles of that drank, I got money in the bank
I can put some niggas on you like piranhas in the tank
All these thirsty bitches out here like piranhas in the tank
All these bitches out here hoeing off regardless what you think
Go the hardest in the paint, I ball hard and you can't
Fuck that bitch like no tomorrow, she gon' swallow like a drank
She gon' chase it with the bars and the molly on the sink
I'm a star, I'ma shine like the diamonds in my lane
Chillin' with my feet up, gotta keep my heat up
Callin' me to meet her, she must want a pussy beat up
I know how to treat her, swish a Swisher Sweet up
Smoke Her like fajitas, hit her and then delete her (delete her)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Bitch, you're a bitch
Ricky P said you was talking that shit
How you're a hoe and you ain't rich?
Need to open your mouth up and eat a dick
Niggas paying for pussy fucking up the game
Say they're players but they're squares, you're so fucking lame
Stop saying you're a pimp when you're tricking nigga
You ain't a pimp, you're just simp
Took her out the street, you put new shoes on her feet
She gon' fuck another rapper, she gon' fuck an athlete
You could turn her into a wife, but she still gon' be a freak
It's young Khalifa man, I just practice what I preach
Bitch, I ain't paying Her!

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Okay, this for all my niggas, got a dope case
Don't play, police tap your phone looking for Jose
Okay, they even got some pics of all the Ros√©
No way, you never would've thought it would be your day!
Okay, what about that hoe? I thINk She thirstay
No way, never trust these hoes, this ain't the old days
No way, I don't give no fuck about what no hoe say
No way, she ain't good for nothin' but some foreplay
Ahh ahh, should've never let her see the foe-way
Tell that bitch what she wanna hear, that's the old way
Shouldn't have let her see the crib, she won't go away
Fuck that bitch and replace her, that's a throwaway
