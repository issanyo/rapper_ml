[Intro]
It make's no sense, it doesn't fit
If it doesn't fit, you must acquit

[Chorus]
Johnny Cochran (Johnny Cochran)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny Cochran)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)

[Bridge]
I don't talk to 12, call my lawyer, Johnny Cochran
Don't read me no charges, call my lawyer, Johnny Cochran
We gon' take this shit to trial, call my lawyer, Johnny Cochran
He gon' beat the case, beat it up like Johnny Cochran

[Verse 1]
I don't talk to 12, I don't sit in cells
I don't do no time, I just post my bail
I might knock a cop out, but I won't take a cop out
I can beat a murder bitch, don't make me pull my Glock out
'Cause what them hoes do is try to de-rose you
If you got the M's, watch who you get close to
If you don't let 'em in, they try to expose you
Right hand on the bible, I'm tellin' the whole truth
Call my lawyer

[Chorus]
Johnny Cochran (Johnny Cochran)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny Cochran)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)

[Bridge]
I don't talk to 12, call my lawyer, Johnny Cochran
Don't read me no charges, call my lawyer, Johnny Cochran
We gon' take this shit to trial, call my lawyer, Johnny Cochran
He gon' beat the case, beat it up like Johnny Cochran

{Verse 2]
Niggas gon' snitch on the plug
I don't say shit to the judge
Hell naw, I don't know shit
I don't know who the nigga was
I don't know where the nigga live
I don't know none of his kids
I don't know what a nigga drive
I don't know where a nigga hide
Niggas ain't loyal these days
Most of 'em got bitch nigga ways
I don't trust none of these niggas
Niggas can't take shit to the grave
Niggas don't use they head
Call your phone from the feds
Tryna get you indicted
Talkin' 'bout what another nigga did
I don't be answering my phone
These niggas shit be tapped
I don't know what niggas on
Talkin' 'bout who got clout
Niggas tellin' on theyselves
Showing everybody they strap
Til' they run in your crib, hands behind your back
Call the lawyer

[Chorus]
Johnny Cochran (Johnny Cochran)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny Cochran)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny)

[Bridge]
I don't talk to 12, call my lawyer, Johnny Cochran
Don't read me no charges, call my lawyer, Johnny Cochran
We gon' take this shit to trial, call my lawyer, Johnny Cochran
He gon' beat the case, beat it up like Johnny Cochran

[Outro]
Johnny
Johnny Cochran (Johnny Cochran)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny Cochran)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny Cochran)
Johnny Cochran (Johnny Cochran)
I don't talk to 12, call my lawyer, Johnny Cochran
Don't read me no charges, call my lawyer, Johnny Cochran
