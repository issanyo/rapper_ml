[Intro: Wale]
Shawty I ain't trying to be to [?] the option is yours
I just heard stories about that glorious inventory, wondered to see what you had in store
I could be a freak if I need to be, I'm saying I could please your needs
So them appointments with them toys and things they need to cease cause they can't even compete with me
If I ain't precise and you ain't suffice and I make time if I got to
But before you get more outta me, I need to get inside you

[Hook: Billy Wes]
Wake up in my room, sit upon the mat
You ain't gotta talk, I can hit it from the back
I can hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Hit it from the back, I can hit it from the back
Wake up in my room, sit upon the mat
You ain't gotta talk, I can hit it from the back
I can hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Hit it from the back, I can hit it from the back

[Verse 1: Wale]
Hey, what it do love? Wassup, babe? Hold time, I ain't ready about the foreplay
I'm a just shoot like Marc Scorsay
See, understand my fort
See, home makes you up, let me smell your make up up
'Fore I break you off, can I taste your love and let you up
You wild as fuck before you go, let me make you come
I make that around like a faucet, and I'm patient, I don't force it
And I ain't playing for your cushion, cause while I been on that bullshit
Got a tattoo with your ex man but I will make you say it's your shit
That's my shit, put a parle on her private, and I got this
Shawty go ahead and slide them, she ride it till she's tired
I inspire loss of pain, she's got that awesome shit, I pork em bitch until I pull her [?] in

[Hook: Billy Wes]
Wake up in my room, sit upon the mat
You ain't gotta talk, I can hit it from the back
I can hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Hit it from the back, I can hit it from the back
Wake up in my room, sit upon the mat
You ain't gotta talk, I can hit it from the back
I can hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Hit it from the back, I can hit it from the back

[Verse 2: Diamond]
I'm his 32 don't try to holler, where them dollars at
Catch me popping bottles in the corner what about is it?
He wanna lick the kitty cat, got him playing [?]
Gotta get that paper, if you wanna get with it
I'm coming from a city dead, really like the [?]
He gonna have a heart attack, life's with it he follow that
'Cause I got the hardest rap, plus I spit the coldest blood
I be there on my tipsy toes, [?]
[?] We fly as fuck, BBS is in the chain
If you hear me, know my name
You fuckin' with a veg
Cock is some shrink, he ain't trying to holler unless this dollar about a check hoe

[Hook: Billy Wes]
Wake up in my room, sit upon the mat
You ain't gotta talk, I can hit it from the back
I can hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Hit it from the back, I can hit it from the back
Wake up in my room, sit upon the mat
You ain't gotta talk, I can hit it from the back
I can hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Hit it from the back, I can hit it from the back


[Verse 3: Juicy J]
I love a chick that smoke that kush, that's down to get real high
And wanna ride in my car, she's suckin' my dick bone dry
Long as she fuckable, I don't care if she [?]
Long as she pay half a week, weed, [?] and wine
I like the way she dance, bounce that ass, break that back
Let me take my 2 fingers and play 'round with that pussycat
I know it's dripping wet, stupid wet, let's do it, let's take some patrol shots
If you can, jump on in, and ride my dick like I've never had it done before
Do it like a stripper, anything you want I'm by the store
Call off the show on floor
You know I'm stupid rich but you can't be mine
And that nigga bitch too

[Hook: Billy Wes]
Wake up in my room, sit upon the mat
You ain't gotta talk, I can hit it from the back
I can hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Hit it from the back, I can hit it from the back
Wake up in my room, sit upon the mat
You ain't gotta talk, I can hit it from the back
I can hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Hit it from the back, I can hit it from the back
