[Verse 1]
Rich nigga and I keep gunnas on my side
Niggas talk, hoes talk, but money don't lie
If you ain't heard, ain't another nigga triller
More Ace of Spades than a blackjack dealer
All in the club with Hollywood's finest
I'm bout to take Katy Perry to King of Diamonds
Ballin', ballin', pretty bitches jocking
If I sign her titties, she going to put it up for auction
Everywhere I go, they roll out the red carpet
I been sipping lean out of solid gold faucets
Respect the game, young nigga
Hating me ain't gonna make you no change, young nigga
Three bourgeoisie bitches and my Phantom outside
I leave it in park, cause they just want a ride
They just want to ride Juicy J like Six Flags
Then I kick them out so fast, they get whip lash
[The Come Up]

[Verse 2]
Brought my homeboys out the hood with me
Now a nigga sell dope records to make drug money
Shout out to the niggas that got love for me
Asian girl fainted as soon as she got a hug from me
Tokyo, that's a long way from North Memphis
Making too much money to be in yall's business
Making moves, chase the money till we all get it
And my pockets so deep, you can fall in them
Started from the bottom, my nigga
Six people, two bedroom apartment, my nigga
Now we pay cash for it all, fuck a lease
Still trying to get in touch with my homie Big Triece
Back-to-back Bentleys, foreign car fleet
NBA playoffs, we ball all week
I don't even hate the niggas hating on me
When their albums come out, I still buy their CDs
And that's real
