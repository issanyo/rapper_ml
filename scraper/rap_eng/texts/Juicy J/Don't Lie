[Hook]
If I call you my nigga, don't you ever fuckin' lie to me
Ain't no second guessin', they can never get as fly as me
I don't care how much you smokin', you can't get as high as me
It don't matter where I'm goin', I'm gon' bring a pipe with me
'Cause talk is cheap, I am a sight to see
I let her ride the D, she plannin' her life with me
I practice what I preach, and thou shalt not be weak
You can lie them niggas and finesse 'em hoes
But don't you ever fuckin' lie to me

[Verse 1]
Can't trust these niggas, can't trust these hoes
That's the way the game go, better watch your main hoe
Niggas only stick around just to get the bankroll
Bitches wanna hold you down when the money can't fold (Hold on)
I know you lyin', you can't even look in my eye
And that's why all of these niggas be dyin'
You do the math, break down the science
And then you will know why I stay with this iron
If I call you my nigga, you know you my nigga
I call you at 3 in the mornin', it's time to go get 'em
Tell me the truth, what would you do? Is you really willin'?
If they did me dirty, would you go and get 'em?
Is you in your feelings?, cause I'm really livin'
Fuck your opinion, I just want truth
No lyin' I won't tell the truth, if I shoot

[Hook]
If I call you my nigga, don't you ever fuckin' lie to me
Ain't no second guessin', they can never get as fly as me
I don't care how much you smokin', you can't get as high as me
It don't matter where I'm goin', I'm gon' bring a pipe with me
Cause talk is cheap, I am a sight to see
I let her ride the D, she plannin' her life with me
I practice what I preach, and thou shall not be weak
You can lie them niggas and finesse 'em hoes
But don't you ever fuckin' lie to me
