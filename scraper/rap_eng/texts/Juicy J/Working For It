[Intro: Juicy J]
You know mane, some niggas is scared of a chic that got her own bag. They feel intimidated and shit. You know what I'm saying?

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Buy your own bags, you working for it
Steady poppin' tags, you working for it
Niggas out here lookin' bad 'cause you working for it
You working for it, shawty, you working for it
You working for it, you working for it
Niggas out here throwin' cash 'cause you working for it
Got your kids up out the trap 'cause you working for it
You working for it, shawty, you working for it

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
These days women be out here working more harder than some niggas be
Spendin' cash, buyin' bags, poppin' tags (Woo!), ain't relyin' on no niggas needs
She like real figures, he want that good life
Shopping sprees, private flights, shined up like a diamond heist
She want Giuseppe's, a Tiffany necklace
Room fifty floors up when she wake up for breakfast
She don't need no niggas, she be mobbin'
Learned how to get to the money back in college
She working harder than these hoes, she hella active
She buyin' bitches in the game, pole practice
Break it off, take it off, shawty's ass, crazy soft
Booty shots or not, niggas pay 'em off
She loves to suck it off, hands off
She a let you shoot at her, like a standoff
She a freak, she know magic, deepthroat the whole package (Woo!)
She fucked that nigga two months ago, he can't leave her alone
She bought a house and a condo, but she ain't never home

[Interlude: Juicy J]
Yeah, that bitch a boss
I see you
Yeah, get your bag

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Buy your own bags, you working for it
Steady poppin' tags, you working for it
Niggas out here lookin' bad 'cause you working for it
You working for it, shawty, you working for it
You working for it, you working for it
Niggas out here throwin' cash 'cause you working for it
Got your kids up out the trap 'cause you working for it
You working for it, shawty, you working for it

[Bridge: Juicy J]
I know a boss bitch with a lot of commas
Straight to the cash, she ain't got no time for drama
I know a boss bitch with a lot of commas
Straight to the cash, she ain't got no time for drama
I know a boss bitch with a lot of commas
Straight to the cash, she ain't got no time for drama
I know a boss bitch with a lot of commas
Straight to the cash, she ain't got no time for drama

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Buy your own bags, you working for it
Steady poppin' tags, you working for it
Niggas out here lookin' bad 'cause you working for it
You working for it, shawty, you working for it
You working for it, you working for it
Niggas out here throwin' cash 'cause you working for it
Got your kids up out the trap 'cause you working for it
You working for it, shawty, you working for it

[Outro: Juicy J]
Ay man, I fuck with a chick that's doin' her own thing, gettin' her own bag, ain't worried 'bout no nigga, you know what I'm sayin'?
It's a new time man, it's a new day. You niggas can't have everything no more, man. These bitches got weed and shit too, my nigga. I'm just tellin' you
