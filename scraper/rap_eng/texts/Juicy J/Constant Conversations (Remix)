[Intro]
Uh huh
Let's never leave
Ooo ohooo ooo, never
I said never ever leave
Let's never, no

[Verse 1 - Juicy J]
The only reason that I'm fly
You stress me out I stay super high
You rolling up, I'm never home
I know it's tough, she done had enough
Ghost love story like Patrick Swayze
Back of the Ghost like Miss Daisy
One night we goin' ride to Vegas
Let's get married and make a baby
I'm in love and she ain't trippin'
She leave me alone when a ninja sippin'
Between the legs they wet and drippin'
For Juicy J to go skinny dippin'
Make up sex everytime we break up
She be fussin', I be baked up
Love the way he go up and down
In the sheets when a ninja wake up
She sprung keep it motivate
Even though I stay vegigate
Drunk texting all through the night
Frustated so inotoxicated
She don't understand I'm out tryna' gettin' this paper
Dirty ratchets chasing me, but I ain't tryna' be Flava
Never on bean
She's in the cream
Get to shakin'
Just like a fiend
Get ya naked
Get ya faded
Then I'm busting
Up in your jeans
Hard body classes like John West
And her pussy hit hard like Ron Artest

[Verse 2]
Well you're wrapped up in a blanket
And you're staring at the floor
The conversation's moderated
By the noisy streets below
I never wanna hurt you baby
I'm just a mess with the name and the prize
And now I'm drunker then before babe
Told me drinking doesn't make me nice

[Hook]
You never know where some people will go
Yes some people been hurting me
You can tell by the look, by the slightest crook
In the neck or a blink of an eye
Well then they'll say what they say
And they'll do what they do
But it doesn't mean a goddamn thing
You can listen if you want, you can listen if you don't
Get a talk, yell and even sing
Everybody now
Oo ooh ooo
The come sing into the window, sing into the trees
Yea they sing into the bright spring leaves
Everybody now
Ooo ooh ooo
Yeah they love you and they need you
But someday you're gonna need to find some other kind of place to go

[Intro]

[Hook 2]
Oo ooh ooo
The come sing into the window, sing into the trees
Yea they sing into the bright spring leaves
Everybody now
Ooo ooh ooo (Sing it loud) (Sing it)
Yeah they love you and they need you
But someday you're gonna need to find some other kind of place to go
Don't you know?
Oo ooh ooo
