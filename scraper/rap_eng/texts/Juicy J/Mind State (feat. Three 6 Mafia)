[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
I tried to warn 'em now they gonna feel the vengeance of Da Devil's Daughter
Horror all because they (?) up from (?) so quick in sorrow
There is no tomorrow, armageddon is gettin' closer, and
Smoking on some green, thinking of a plan to rob a man
Scarecrow my nigga, do you think that I can do this shit?
Do you think I can get away so smooth after I hit this bitch?
It can be done so all for one and one for fucking all
Who got them 9s? Who got them Tecs? Fuck alla y'all!

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Psychedelical spirits they spiral inside a kaleidoscope
What would happen if I traveled back in time and replaced the Ten Commandments with something I wrote?
The world warfare ended some thousands of years ago, by the rapper Lord Infamous "Scarecrow"
Happiness is not even a option my friend, it is something that you'll never know
Believe superstitions, swarm bees and zombies
Sea monsters and sorcery, witches, genies, three wishes
Give the Scarecrow permission, keys to the door way
Further the regions of your mind
I explain the unexplainable myths and times

[Hook: Lord Infamous & (DJ Paul)] 4x
Triple 6 is my mindstate (killa, killa)
Pre-occupied with devil shit (murderer, murderer)
Trying to survive through this crime rate

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
Sittin' on a porch, firin' a torch to the light green
Weed then proceed to my mission as I plot a scheme
Meanwhile the sun set, trees blowing spookiness
Twist the doorknob to my viper, inside was the mask and Tech
So I scooped Koop and Boo, load up the Tech two with me man
Keys to the ceilin' is what they got for me to come over and stang
Kick some doors, put some hoes on some mother fucking floors
Give me da motherfuckin' chingching, hoe before you go in smoke

[Verse 4: Koopsta Knicca]
Picture this, picture that - where your little kids at?
At the back of the alley, blast 'em with them Glocks and Tecs
Sad to see they killed the nigga was innocent, though he was guilty they figured
Not knowing that he was a mafia member, a mafia member found tossed in the river
Loosened his skull, dent in his mug
Blood scattered all over the place, no escape
For someone that saw all they face
None of them got them a murder case
Laying in disguise, get the lies out they minds
As they fly high, wide in the skies
Open they eyes, then they realize

[Hook: Lord Infamous & (DJ Paul)] 4x
Triple 6 is my mindstate (killa, killa)
Pre-occupied with devil shit (murderer, murderer)
Trying to survive through this crime rate

[Verse 5: Juicy J]
Is it Friday the 13th, are you niggas scared?
As I cock my gun back, put a bullet through your head
I spit them dreads
Whatever, whatever, you better beware
The evilest scare
Leaves nothing but shells and gun smoke in the air
I got them Glocks
So if you run you'll hear them pop
And then you'll drop
I'll come up on ya and never stop
Till I reach that point
To wipe you out, you hoes and haters
Smoke you like joints
You should have prayed to God to save ya

[Verse 6: Crunchy Black]
It was on a Sunday night, a nigga hit Paul back
He said he had a job for us to do to meet him at the Hardys at the mall and democrat
My girl beeped me, she told me Paul was on his fucking way
Hit me on his cellular phone, he's balling down parkway
Paul rolled up in a Viper mane
I jumped on the passenger seat and that's when he like started to explain
How we gonna touch these hoes, shake them hoes, put 'em in a viper trunk
Roll 'em to our stash spot and then we cut they body up
