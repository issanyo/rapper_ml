[Intro]

[Verse]
Niggas run up, I pull the mask up
Back up, boys fuck around you need back up
Ridin' around town with his shotgun
I'm looking like the sheriff
I got the pistol tucked, I see the cops up in the mirror
You know I'm riding high cause I can't deal with life
Gotta sober up my thoughts, yeah Jesus walks
I feel like I'm him, I feel like I'm Scarface
I feel like I'm God, and I ain't even in a safe place
I'm still in the hood and I'm still with the good
Trapped my own self, I backed my own self
I don't need a mob cause you know I do the job
I did the shit before, I do this shit again
I still got demons in my motherfuckin' back
And I thank God that I never sold crack
I rob a killer, negative is negative
You selling all rock, I'm gonna take everything you get
Family numbers, dope fiend, coke fiend, it ain't hard
Smoke screen, seen my father *blank* fiend
I ain't never met the same blood as him
And I just do the same drugs, and I got the same heart
And we share the same love
See myself and I don't really know him
So I really don't even know myself
Can I be searching for a deeper life
It feel like a dream
Now I can finish what I started
You can see what you ordered
This is for real
A bitch is lyin' tryna say I was the daddy
I came back 0 bitch, you never had me
Lying ass groupies tryna take you down for child support
Fucked so many dudes that she didn't know who to call
Bitch don't call me, talk not cheap
And my time not free
Bitch don't call me, and talk not cheap
And my time is not free

[Outro]
