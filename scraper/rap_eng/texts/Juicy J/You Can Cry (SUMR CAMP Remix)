[Chorus: James Arthur]
Oh, you can cry on my shoulder
Everything's alright
All the pain is finally over
You can close your eyes
Oh, you can cry on my shoulder
Everything's alright
All the pain is finally over
You can close your eyes

[Post-Chorus]
Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes

[Verse 1]
(Woo) I was up late night ballin' (woo)
Almost made you wanna throw the towel in (hey)
Almost made you wanna trade the style in (uh-oh)
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands (uh-oh)
100 stacks, run it back, Hester
Double up, one more time, no pressure (no pressure)
I believe in you, so you next up
I put diamonds in your cross, God bless ya
You put the work in (woo), you deserve that
Hard work pays off, I know you heard of that (heard of that)
Slow it down, lemme show you how to work that (oh)
That coupe you was dreamin' 'bout, you can swerve that (it's yours)
You just gotta take a chance, take control of that
You just gotta chase the dream, get a hold of that (uh-huh)
Then you put in overtime, nothing over that
Then you do it one more time, gotta run it back

[Chorus: James Arthur]
Oh, you can cry on my shoulder
Everything's alright
All the pain is finally over
You can close your eyes
Oh, you can cry on my shoulder
Everything's alright
All the pain is finally over
You can close your eyes

[Post-Chorus]
Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes

[Verse 2]
(Woo) I was up late night ballin' (woo)
Almost made you wanna throw the towel in (hey)
Almost made you wanna trade the style in (uh-oh)
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands (uh-oh)
100 stacks, run it back, Hester
Double up, one more time, no pressure (no pressure)
I believe in you, so you next up
I put diamonds in your cross, God bless ya
I don’t wanna wait (hey)
I don’t need a break (hey)
You just bring the gift (hey)
I’ma bring the cake (uh-huh)
Go for two rounds
Light a spliff (uh-huh)
You laying next to a star, make a wish (a wish)
I got somethin’ you can ride if you need a lift (yessir)
Whenever you with me, the problems don’t exist
Anywhere you wanna go, scratch it off your list
Then you do it one more time

[Outro]
I was up late night ballin' (woo)
I was up late night ballin' (woo)
I was up late night ballin' (woo)
I was up late night ballin' (woo)
