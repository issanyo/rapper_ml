[Hook: Juicy J]
I'ma get paid either way this shit go
Nigga, you know how we get down (you know)
Watch what you say, gotta keep it on the low
Nigga, you know how we get down (you know)
I ain't seen shit, I don't know what happened
Nigga, you know how we get down (you know)
I'm hood rich, I don't know how to act
Nigga, you know how we get down (you know)
You know how we get down (you know)
We ain't had shit, we the shit now (you know)
You know how we get down (you know)
Better keep your eye on your bitch now (you know)
Get it out the mud with the niggas that you love
Nigga, you know how we get down (you know)
When I come through the hood, I be showin' niggas love
Nigga, you know how we get down (you know)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
You know what the fuck it is nigga
When I walk through everybody want a picture (snap)
Hoes got their phones out, niggas snappin' photos (photos)
Feds smartin' up, niggas gotta the bring drones out (drones out)
If it ain't about the money what we talkin' 'bout? (talkin' 'bout)
Niggas hate to see me get it, point 'em out (point 'em out)
Laughin' to the bank in a black Bentley
Save the deposit box two-hundred-and-fifty
People always ask how I do I stay winnin'
'Cause I stick to the plan, bosses do real business
Private jet to the island, countin' money in silence
Please no fuck niggas around me (please!)
Niggas with my spot, thotties on my cock
Pull up in a drop, middle finger to the cops
If I'm innocent or not, wifey in a whip, baby on a way
Spent a million dollars on my kid, what the fuck can a hater say?

[Hook: Juicy J]
I'ma get paid either way this shit go
Nigga, you know how we get down (you know)
Watch what you say, gotta keep it on the low
Nigga, you know how we get down (you know)
I ain't seen shit, I don't know what happened
Nigga, you know how we get down (you know)
I'm hood rich, I don't know how to act
Nigga, you know how we get down (you know)
You know how we get down (you know)

Nigga, you know how we get down (you know)

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Nigga cut the bullshit (bullshit)
I've been here grindin' like a motherfuckin' toolkit
Puttin' in the work, I never quit
Ballin' like Lebron in my Nikes, bitch I need another championship
Niggas bet against me, what are the odds? (odds)
Walk up in the church and get features from God (hey)
Jesus piece with the diamonds (diamonds)
I'm so blessed to be alive, you see me shinin' (you see me shinin')
If you ain't callin' about the money, I'ma let it ring
Y'all niggas on a scene, just to make a scene
I know how you gettin' down, you ain't did a ting
I'm the proof you ain't gotta lot to live a dream or to get to heaven
And I still don't leave the house without a weapon
And I still won't trust a nigga for a second (hell-naw)
You know how I get down, I've been tearin' da club up since '97
