[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Got money, retarded
Don't want her if it don't clap when she walking
Not too pretty in the face, but she super thiiiiick
I'm just thinking with my dick
My shit dumb
I'm just thinking with my dick
My shit dumb
I'm just thinking with my dick

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Skip the line, on my mind
VIP going mad
Bandz a make her dance
With a bag full of zans
Got my Vans in advance
Acting bad on them tabs
Pants cost a grand
Put that ass in my hands
Duffel bag full of cash
She a model? I'mma get her
Seen 'em now
She stop, popped, and squat by the zipper
Thinking out loud
My dick probably trynna kill her
Helpin' somebody
The bitch wiped off the liqour
Going live
Long hair, shawty ride like Geronimo
Sayin' I got the gas
I ain't talkin' 'bout Conoco
Knock the whole click down
I'm talking like dominoes
One hit wonder
When we finish, adios

I'm just thinking with my dick

I'm just thinking with my dick

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Me and this bitch ain't gon' make it to the suite
I'mma put her on her knees right here VIP
I'm a dog ass nigga, I'm not fucking with no fleas
If I saw that bitch again, I probably won't even speak
And why you taking care of that bitch?
Wait 'til you find out that we sharing that bitch
Head trippy with your girl and her girlfriend
Bet you never even knew she was a lesbian
Man that girl swallow nut like an elephant
Stupid nigga, probably thought yo bitch was celibate
Like a dentist with a drill, I be digging in they mouth
First they swallow all my children then I kick them bitches out
