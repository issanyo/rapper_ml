[Hook]
Stay your ass in your yard if you ain't with this street shit
You vegetarians don't want this beef shit, nah!
So keep my name out your mouth
These hundred round drums 'a make a frame out your house

[Verse 1]
I got 99 problems so I pack a hundred rounds
If you don't know me by know, then you nowhere to be found
Prolly face down in the ditch
Head quarters for a bitch
One two minute from your limbs
So I had to shut that shit, fuck that shit!
No remorse, fuck the law, fuck the court
They won't find you, they won't miss you
They won't recognize your corpse
And if a nigga mention my name on first 48
He gon' wish the police would have burned this tape

[Hook x2]
Stay your ass in your yard if you ain't with this street shit
You vegetarians don't want this beef shit, nah!
So keep my name out your mouth
These hundred round drums 'a make a frame out your house

[Verse 2]
All my guys paid off
It ain't no lay off, no day off
These niggas damn fools, they bring mayhem and chaos
You furr for your life, you should pack up and take off
But you ain't gon' see us coming with them big guns
Bitches gossip and niggas gossip like bitches
Wanna find out what I got, what I'm spending
My money long, some rappers be pretending
If you ain't build for this street shit - don't get in

[Hook x2]
Stay your ass in your yard if you ain't with this street shit
You vegetarians don't want this beef shit, nah!
So keep my name out your mouth
These hundred round drums 'a make a frame out your house
