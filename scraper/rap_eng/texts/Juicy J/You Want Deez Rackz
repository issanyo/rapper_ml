[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I'm like a nigga gettin' cream on a triple beam
So much money in my face, I'm livin' a dream
Whips outside
Bitches wanna ride
Cause they know them trap niggas got them drug ties
They wanna get high for free and a shopping spree
Bitch roll me up some weed 'fore you hit yo knees
Want money in yo purse?
You gone have to work
Get your ass on the floor
Mix in with the dirt

[Hook x2: Juicy J]
You want deez rackz ho?
Pick that shit up off the floo'
You want deez rackz ho?
Pick that shit up off the floo' (x3)
You want deez rackz ho?
Pick that shit up off the floo'

[Verse 2: Juicy J]

My neck is froze
Jewellery be 20 below
I'm waken baken
Money still risin' like dough
These bitches jockin' they think I'm in the NBA
I got money like them niggas but I'm Juicy J
Chrome rims on anything that's foreign
Bad bitches from overseas flown in
A big mansion all my weed stanky
So many titles under my belt Yankees
If you money hungry bitch I'mma feed ya
You actin' brand new
I'mma teach ya
The trippy niggas don't really give a damn
I throw money in yo face bitch BANDS!

[Hook]
