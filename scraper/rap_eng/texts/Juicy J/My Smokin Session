[Intro: Frayser Boy & Boogie Mane]
Aye, Crunchy told ya he had "3 Different Kinds of Weed" in a bowl

Do the damn thang, get the lighter, fire it up bitch
Do the damn thang, get the lighter, fire it up (Fire it up)
This is a smokin session

[Verse 1: Frayser Boy]
I got a smokin habit
Got it? Then let me have it
That 'Dro would make me happy
Sticky like Laffy-Taffy
Fiendin cause I'm an addict
Never caught blazin babbage
Hurry and let me grab it
Extend your arm and pass it
I'm rollin through the hood, my windows half-cracked
The firest shit up in the town, gots ta have that
Inhale, exhale, inhale, and blow it out
Give me that 'Dro, plus a mic, I'm showin out
So nigga what'cha mean?
My favorite color green
I keep a blurry scene
From shit'cha never seen
This fuckin 'Dro I'm chokin, it got me mad-straight
I'm feelin like I'm on that movie called "Half Baked"
I'm smokin half weight, my eyes real heavy
I'm flyin home to my broad cause I feel ready
Been smokin all night, ain't gotta ask that question
I'm feelin alright, this is my smokin session

[Hook: Frayser Boy & Boogie Mane]

[Verse 2: Boogie Mane]
Smoke on a daily basis
Don't even ask me why
My head be full of Marijuana, evidence in eyes
Drift off to other places, you wouldn't think I be
Pass me the weed so I can roll me up another B
I know you got it nigga, don't make me ask again
Cause you don't wanna "say hello to my little friend"
Known to cause confrontations, like every now and then
Boy fuck the conversation, put that Hydro in the wind
His ass start to uhh choke and, smoke fillin up his lungs
So when I hit and showed him, showed him what his ass won
Reach down into yo pockets, and give me all yo weed
And clown stop all the flaugin, cause this shit ain't what'cha need
Some niggas try ta copy, and doin what they see
But then they do it sloppy, fuckin up this lovely weed
Call me the Boogie Mane, and I'ma keep ya guessin
What fuckin zone I'm in when I be in my smokin session

[Hook: Frayser Boy & Boogie Mane]
