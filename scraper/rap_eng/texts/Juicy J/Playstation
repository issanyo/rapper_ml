[Intro]
Yeah mayne, yeah mayne
These motherfuckin suckers up in here playin these motherfuckin games man
Ain't nuttin but a ho-ass nigga man and you know it
Put your finger on his motherfuckin fo'head and push that sucker head back man
And tell that nigga man, tell that nigga

[Bridge]
You a (ho) nigga
(ho) nigga, (ho) nigga (ho)
You a (ho) nigga (ho)
Nigga (ho) nigga (ho)

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Play wit'cha Playstation (x4)
Don't play with me boy (no sir) (x4)

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Niggas think that I need 'em, I'm the one that feed 'em
I'm the one that lead 'em, I'm the one that freed 'em
Nothin can subtract from me I make a hundred thousand daily
Niggas thinkin that they hurtin me, I'm the one that's payin me
This ain't one man to grow on, real niggas keep this in mind
Never cash yo' pearls from off these snakes, and these fuckin swines
Show less than necessary, keep these fakers off in the dark
Half off these niggas ain't happy for ya, over half wanna see you robbed
Try to get yo' hook up, course you have to get your connect
They ain't heard of the word love, they ain't heard of the word respect
Never let 'em know what'chu got, don't work with friends, use enemies
Bitch you wanna be me? ho don't play me

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
You actin like you hard, and you say what you done robbed
You say you from the hood, and you claiming all the parts
I heard you sold a little dope but then I heard you didn't
I know you on the dog food, cause that's why you was itching
They say you just a lil' bitch, a look can be deceiving
They say you carry a big gun, but I don't believe that either
And every girl you talk you make as if you knocked it up
Is you 16 on down, nigga what the fuck?
I know you gotta make some ends, lie and shit to impress your friends
Say you own a big boy Benz, did 20 years in pen
Flauging like you own own, flauging cause you known known
Don't you know I'm grown grown, and I crack yo' dome dome

[Bridge] + [Hook]
