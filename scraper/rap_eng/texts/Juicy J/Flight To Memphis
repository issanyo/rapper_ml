[Intro]
You are now listening to a Bobby Johnson Beat

[Chorus: Smooky MarGielaa & Juicy J]
Take a flight to Memphis, we came from the trenches
Ballin' on the game, y'all be sittin' on the benches
50 for my necklace, boy, they didn't expect this
Ice on my wrist, try to take it, we go reckless (Yeah, ho)
Take a flight to Memphis, we came from the trenches
Ballin' on the game, y'all be sittin' on the benches
50 for my necklace, boy, they didn't expect this
Ice on my wrist, try to take it, we go reckless

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Okay, took a flight to Memphis, need to mind your business
Whippin' foreign, Lambo tinted, you are not squad
Yeah, the ice too bright, I'm too high off the whippets
Got your bitch's attention, bye-bye, heard she mine
You say that's your shorty, then why she all over me?
She like smokin', takin' money with the team (Oh, yeah, she do)
By herself, you can't blame this shit on me (Uh-uh)
All this jealousy, that's why I keep a .40 on me

[Chorus: Smooky MarGielaa & Juicy J]
Take a flight to Memphis, we came from the trenches
Ballin' on the game, y'all be sittin' on the benches
50 for my necklace, boy, they didn't expect this
Ice on my wrist, try to take it, we go reckless (Yeah, ho)
Take a flight to Memphis, we came from the trenches
Ballin' on the game, y'all be sittin' on the benches
50 for my necklace, boy, they didn't expect this
Ice on my wrist, try to take it, we go reckless

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
North, North
All my niggas rich, bitch, known to keep a big stick
I can't give a bitch shit, I be on my pimp shit (You know it)
She know I don't give a shit, but I'm on her wishlist
Your Rollie ain't worth shit, if it goes tick-tick (You can't)
I'm from North Memphis, you can get your wig split
If a nigga talk shit, put him on a hit-list (Yah)
I be poppin' big shit, smokin' on that Christmas
My whip costs me six bricks, gotta keep my wrist lit (Yah)
Yeah, she wanna fuck me 'cause she saw what I'm whippin'
(North Memphis, North Memphis)
Took that ho and hit her, buddy thought she was missin'
(North Memphis, North Memphis)
Bitch gon' miss she loves me but I wasn't even listenin' (Damn)
(North Memphis, North Memphis)
Says she want to take a trip I drop that hoe off in Memphis
(North Memphis, North Memphis)
North, North

[Chorus: Smooky MarGielaa & Juicy J]
Take a flight to Memphis, we came from the trenches
Ballin' on the game, y'all be sittin' on the benches
50 for my necklace, boy, they didn't expect this
Ice on my wrist, try to take it, we go reckless (Yeah, ho)
Take a flight to Memphis, we came from the trenches
Ballin' on the game, y'all be sittin' on the benches
50 for my necklace, boy, they didn't expect this
Ice on my wrist, try to take it, we go reckless

[Verse 3: Smooky MarGielaa]
Ice on my wrist, try to take it, we go reckless
I got Flacko with me in the 'Rari, we stay flexin'
And they want me walk through, boy, you better have that check in
[?], Vlone what I'm dressed in
Ayy, scoop your shorty, take her home, she what I need
She say, "Smooky in the gang shit with the team"
Foreign cars, watch me skrrt off in a Beam'
[?] Margiela fiends, boy, you know I stay fiendin'

[Chorus: Smooky MarGielaa & Juicy J]
(Yeah, ho)
Take a flight to Memphis, we came from the trenches
Ballin' on the game, y'all be sittin' on the benches
50 for my necklace, boy, they didn't expect this
Ice on my wrist, try to take it, we go reckless (Yeah, ho)
Take a flight to Memphis, we came from the trenches
Ballin' on the game, y'all be sittin' on the benches
50 for my necklace, boy, they didn't expect this
Ice on my wrist, try to take it, we go reckless

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
Put the gangsta on me, make me feel I'm in Memphis
Way she gangsta walkin', make me feel I'm in Memphis
When I think about it, girl, I feel I'm in Memphis
And the pussy good money and it still up in business (Uh)
Put the gangsta on me, make me feel I'm in Memphis
Way she gangsta walkin', make me feel I'm in Memphis
But, when I'm in that pussy, girl, I'm scared I'ma miss it
Ever since then you...
