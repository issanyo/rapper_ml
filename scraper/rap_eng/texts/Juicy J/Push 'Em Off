Hook x4
Push 'em off, push 'em off in here

Chorus x10
Push 'em off, tear it up
Push 'em off in here

(Lord Infamous)
You better back up off this
We got custom made coffins
I got a bird restin' on my desk
Up in my office
I gotta make it babe
Miss rate me
Make you niggas hate me
Im goin' flossin' through these last days
My life is crazy
You call the army, the marines
You better call the navy
It's Keyzer Soze from the thugs
And we world dominating
Because the nigga take his slaves
Up in the home of the brave
We gonna push the panic button
Don't nobody behave
So get rough, get rugged, get wild, get naughty
We the thugs out of hell
And he sent us to party
Lord Infamous plus the Three 6 are prophet in my blood
That is what's
Keepin' me so buck
Tearin' at the clubs
Kickin' tables, knockin' over chairs, sets in the air
Shake ya derriere, shake 'em everywhere
Off on the scrilla grind
So I gotta lose my mind
Tear Da Club Up Thugs
Ghetto love till the end of time

Chorus x10

On my way now to Rodmans house
Never happy, keep on rappin'

Chorus x10

(Juicy "J")
I'm about to elbow a nigga, elbow a nigga
Cock the gun and pull back the trigger, pull back the trigger
Meetiing in the parking lot
I always wear mouth a lot
We can go toe to toe
To the floor, on the spot
Hope this spot is well standed
Left and right is how I panic
With a chrome anna canon
Peepin' game and now were standin'
Only land game I hated
Jealous cause we clockin' paper
Plus I used to hack
And now I'm ridin' fool, I'll see you later
Now I see you muggin' in my face
When I'm ridin' up
Say you saw the late nite video and tear da club up
Hopin' and wishin'
That the mafia is finished
Ho yeah know
We was in it to win it
And to you dirty freaks, paperchasin'
Now you on that jock
We don't want the blunts
That you lacin', that be gettin' you high
But I got a knife in my pocket
Would I roll it on
Let the steam
About to cut ya
Get a hustle
Get ya own, fool

Chorus x10

Tear it up x8
