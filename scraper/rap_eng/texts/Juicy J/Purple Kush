[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I'm so high eyes red as fire
Smoke so much weed dancing in the sky
Shots of patron downing with a beer
Bitches in my ear but i can't hear
Cause I'm in a zone I ain't going home
I'm sending drunkin' texts out on my phone
Its my birthday its a party
Yea a nigga drunk yea I'm shit faced
And I'm popping pills i don't give a damn
Where a nigga is I'm going ham
See you at the bar see you in the park
See you sucking my dick in the back of my car

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2: Gorilla Zoe]
I got purple in my cup purple in my blunt
Pull up to the trap like shawty what you want
Bricks in the fender the moneys in the trunk
Bust the baggies open..there's nothing up in my funk
The whole hood know me the whole hood love me
The haters want above me
Bitches wanna fuck me get money like Nike
Boy just do it my money so dumb
My swag go stupid i don't drink crisp
I drink purple fruity bitch these are diamonds
These are not cootys I'm leaning right now
This purple shit the truth and I'm high right now
I'm smoking in the booth..

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Strawberry cigarillos full of the purple roll up that blunto
Light up that purple mind in a circle cuz we on our third blunt
Buff weed smokers get up on our third hut
Walking in the club throw smell a bunny on my clothes
Inhale the kush blunt blow the smoke out my nose
Niggas know the loud let me emphasize
A nigga sell loud I'm in the crowd tryna advertise
Hennessy fif to my lips now im straight mane
Fresh off of purple so I'm rolling like a freight train
Gucci shoes Gucci bandanna suckas hate mane
40 stacks at the mall like I'm flipping cakes mane
