(Intro)
Friday night ended a sixteen-month long investigation into a complex drug and money laundering case. Federal agents say Memphis is a hub for major drug activity. Cooperating together, federal, state, and local agents are working hard to stop the flow of drugs pouring into our community

In a multi-agency effort dubbed Operation Jetta, which landed 12 people in jail facing federal charges for their involvement in a comprehensive drug and money laundering conspiracy

(Chorus)
Imma hustle till I die (x4)
Imma hustle (x8)
Imma hustle till I die (x4)
Imma hustle (x8)

(Verse 1: Juicy J)
Cause niggas be plottin’ on me, fakin’ like they my homie
Realest nigga in the game, from the hood I ain’t phony
Choppas on the front seat, choppas on the back seat
Goons in the back seat, blowin’ blunts of purple weed
Liquor on my breath, so I gotta relieve the stress
Cause these feds on my ass, and these jackers wanna test
Man I flood up the streets, show some love on some bricks
Couple of quarters of that mid weed, you can have it
We goin re-up, re-up, I gotta get this weed up
Nigga I got the best shit, so now I take my fees up
Patrón in my system, I’m high off that tequila
Celebrate all day, cause I just made a million

(Chorus)
Imma hustle till I die (x4)
Imma hustle (x8)
Imma hustle till I die (x4)
Imma hustle (x8)
(Juicy J)
(Yes sir, V-Slash! Lets go)

(Verse 2: V Slash)
They ask me what’s my point of hustling
I tell a nigga like this here
I’m single, no kids, I ain’t struggling
Plus I came from a dead end
Where you had to do something
Sell weed, rob some blow or get up off the hit
Find you something better to do
Cause if you ain’t getting no money
I can’t see myself hanging ‘round you
I’m a hustler, I transport those manufactured goods
Do a 100 on the road, just to make it to the hood
I don’t sleep, I don’t stop
Plus my heat stay cocked
I shoot, I pop
Until yo stupid ass drop
I can’t cop, I’m like fuck it
I don’t need bum weed
Just keep some on my book
Till I get up outta there

(Juicy J)
Cause imma hustle till I die
