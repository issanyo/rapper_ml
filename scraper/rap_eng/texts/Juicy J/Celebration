Charger on them 26's and I'm blazing (x3)
We on vacation celebrating 'cos we made it
Charger on them 26's and I'm blazing (x3)
We on vacation celebrating 'cos we made it

[Verse 1]
Summertime living, me and my bitch 'bout to head down to Miami just to go swimming
We gon' drink so much liqueur we gon' be sweating Henny
I'mma pop a 'E' pill while she dipping skinny
I'd normally wear a rubber but fuck Jimmy
I'm tryna have a good time 'cos there ain't many niggas that party like me, get high like me, spend money like me, that's not likely
Reservation's at a 5-Star spot, sippin' bubbly on a 5-Star yacht
And when the sun goes down we hitting the town
A 2Pac lifestyle, yeah, I get around

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Day two, slowing down on my sipping
I'm 'bout to get on my boat with some deap-see fishing
Kick back, relax, smoking, reminiscing, on how a nigga came so far in this business
I'm watching white girls play volleyball, I wanna play, can I join y'all
And my girl ain't tripping, she likes girls too
We can take this game to the room 202
Me on her, her on you, do what it do
I got the perfect camera view, I love to shoot
We on vacation so 'Fuck it' I'm feeling brand new
Live life, and that's the truth

[Hook]
