[Verse 1]
Ooh my God they caught this nigga loafin'
Hit him for his chain then see what else he toting
Tell that fuck nigga I need all the money I loaned him
And if he talkin shit then fuck it smoke him
To his mamma when you see your son on the news
This is business bitch don't get it confused
He owed me two racks so they found him in two's
Fives tens twenties fifties bitch pay your dues
I don't give a fuck money is money
Yeah I'm geeked up but ain't shit funny
Cause niggas don't fuck with you like you fuck with them
They want the money and the fame minus hustling

[Hook]
I still mob through my city like I'm fucking King Kong
What the fuck is y'all on what the fuck is y'all on
Like I don't ride with them burners go bur rum ba bum bum
What the fuck is y'all on what the fuck is y'all on
Juicy got the streets talking cause a nigga still on
Still riding clean still getting high still blown
What the fuck is y'all on what the fuck is y'all on
Like I don't ride with them burners go bur rum ba bum bum

[Verse 2]
I'mma pull them bazookas out and start cleaning house
Kidnapped and missing that's how we do it in the Dirty South
And when I come through you pussy niggas gone respect it
And stop crying over these bitches being eyeball reckless
Cause niggas want to fight over hoes and kill themselves
Before they do that they trying to kill somebody else
These niggas stupid as fuck that's why I keep my shit on me
Cause all these jackers think they gone rob me ain't gone get a piece
But I'm just laughing at them I'll grab my mask and get them
I'm from the old school I'll go buy the realist system
If it's illegal don't tell no nigga your business
Cause you'll be in your house and them jackers will be in it

[Hook]
I still mob through my city like I'm fucking King Kong
What the fuck is y'all on what the fuck is y'all on
Like I don't ride with them burners go bur rum ba bum bum
What the fuck is y'all on what the fuck is y'all on
Juicy got the streets talking cause a nigga still on
Still riding clean still getting high still blown
What the fuck is y'all on what the fuck is y'all on
Like I don't ride with them burners go bur rum ba bum bum
