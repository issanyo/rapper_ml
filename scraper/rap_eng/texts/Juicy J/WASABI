(Bounce x 2)

All the bitches, Just pull your motha' fuckin' shirt down
I just wanna' see some titties, Ya know what I'm sayin
Yeah
Left Brain, on the beat
Shout out to my nigga Juicy cuh'

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
We been buzzin', been buzzin' uhh. (yeah)
Niggas claim they OG (Wolf Gang!)
We still young and still humble uhh
Don't make me go back to the old me (brrooop)
I hold heat, breed cold feet, niggas deceased
I figured that treat, trickin' like a religion (bitch!)
Livin' without a wisdom, eternal forbidden in prison unforgiven (These mu'fuckas say, that I ain't livin!)
I'm ridin' on the motha' fuckin' pavement
Bout' to get sued, I ain't worried about a buck a payment
I'm layin' flow like concrete, writing on a cement
I ain't in high school no more, nigga stuck in pre-tenth
Fuck English, check my french Yo HÃ¡blame gato
Boxin' with my vato, bendin' rims in LA pot holes
Hollywood, livin' jolly good, I got a Ed Hardy wood
Chip free as a bitch that harded college, she get it started
I'ma' turn her out, this college broads in office
I treat her like my assistant, hit her from long distance
Bitch any track, Higashi Miyagi spazz on
If you copped the shit then why you wear it with the tag on?
You niggas surf, I swag on, like I'm the last song
Bitch I hit the hash bong, smoke till it's cash gone
I got the talent, niggas wish to write this
My eyes pink like conjunctivitis, I spit gingivitis
Bitches self invite themselves, in to my crib, cause' I'm the upper shelf
Tell my counselor that I need some help, as long as I'm rockin' my championship belt

[Verse2: Juicy J]
Ferrari California, Smokin' California
Pipes of that activist will put you in a coma
I'm countin' on my riches, I'm on a trippy mission
Get high, get cash, fuck them ratchet bitches
I'm tossin' all the groupies, I feed them bitches roofies
I'm so turned up with my niggas and my eses'
Pocket full of money nigga, I'ma' bet it all
All these hoes beggin' for it I'm gon' let them all
Take em' on a trip, let em' see the life
Never caught a feelin' but I fuck her like my wife
Smokin' on a beach, feet all in the sand
Hit a couple of booty clubs, throw a couple grand
Roll the fuck my peep hole, pockets full of C notes
On my way to Vegas, fuck up the casino
Sippin' on some sizzurp, hold the fuck my shizzirt
You niggas goin' broke but you see Juicy J is getting richer

[Verse3: Hodgy Beats]
In here with some model bitches, nigga take a picture
I pimp her like a swisher, I face the one hitter
I drink the drank I'm drunken, now I'm tryna' function
I put my shades on like fuck ya' assumptions
I'm smokin' on the baseline, cause I don't play gods
AK, knives on bay watch, I can make your day stop
I bring the whole band and the floats like we parade lives
I pulled the plug and tossed the shit, then the grenade pops
Like Tom stebato, saphire and henny and the yegar nigga
I'm on the baseline, cause' I'm a team player nigga
Listen to the baseline, and it'll see you later nigga
In ya' nightmares, you better fuckin' bring your prayers with ya'
Kill a bitch on any track, rewind it let it throw it back
It's cold as jack frost on this bitch, blizzard flow
All you hoes you get lost in this bitch
You better watch your words, and the way you floss in this...(Bitch)
