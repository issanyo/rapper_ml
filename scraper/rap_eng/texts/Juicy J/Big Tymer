[Intro]
808 Mafia

[Chorus]
I'm walkin' in lookin' like a million dollars
Big timer, bitch, holler
Looking like a motherfuckin' big timer
Looking like a motherfuckin' big timer
I look like, yeah
Money bitch
I look like
Money bitch
Bitch, I look like money

[Verse 1]
I step on the jet, Cuban link chain on my neck
I smell like cash, I look like a cheque
I land in your city, they seein' all the women
I pull out all them bands, they all comin' with me
Kush give me energy, nobody real as me
So many diamonds, you stand too close, then you finna freeze
Hustlin' ain't dead homie, you niggas terrified
So dope in this game, I slang a verse like I'm sellin' pies
Ten in the mornin', I wake up countin' money
Then go to the club and we turn up on a Monday
What can I say, I make more dough than a funnel cake
Pull my chain out in the club and make it look like a sunny day

[Chorus]
I'm walkin' in lookin' like a million dollars
Big timer, bitch, holler
Looking like a motherfuckin' big timer
Looking like a motherfuckin' big timer
I look like, (You know it) yeah
Money bitch
I look like
Money bitch
Bitch, I look like money

[Verse 2]
You talkin' shit, you got nothin' on me
Twenty thousand dollar ring finger
I'm flickin' these hoes
Assume the position
With a nigga flickin', countin' this dough
These is double digits, nigga
I wanna triple double
Nigga highlights on my level, nigga
Chewed up, whipped up
Our brand new main chick
Her skin white leopard, nigga
(Heyyyyyyyyyyy!)
I feel like money, bitch
I can go buy brand new jet if I wanted it, runnin' bitch
Then go buy a crib in the hills, worth ten mil
Turn to a farm, grow some weed, Holyfield
Bitch, I tried to tell 'em
I'm all about my bankin'
Franklin, Jackson, Grant
Stacks on stacks, they say you are what you eat
Shit, I don't come cheap
Bitch, I'm hood rich, I got M's in my teeth
