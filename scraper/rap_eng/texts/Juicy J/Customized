(Bridge: Yamine)
Jordans all white
All high priced
I’m going to freaking pay
Till it’s all right
Tell Tim I’m damn nice
I don’t care I’ll go and fight
These shoes are everything
I got them customized

(Verse 1: Yamine)
One day I went online
And saw this nice price
They was all clean
So sparkly and all white
I colored them all red
With a golden Jordan sign
I didn’t care because to me it was all right
I spent 200$
To me it was like 200 hundred llamas
Shoes are so expensive
I’m getting rid of them commas
Now I’m freaking broke
And have to help my mama
I don’t want the drama, but if I got to I pop them collars
I gotta get likes all up
Like Kyrie Irving I’m a freaking clutch
Getting in and out of situations
People don’t give a fuck
I dress nice so I have to tuck
Button up my shirt and win a couple bucks

(Verse 2: Juicy J)
Juicy J dat Taylor Gang
Yamine know, that he runs the game
I be killing verses
Like I drive a train
Fuck you think I am
In Memphis I am the mane
Everything I have is customized
Lamborghini, Supercar
You name the price
Juicy be killing them knights
Retro 4’s is nice
Put a mirror to it and shine it in the light
I don’t give a damn if your bitch freaking bite
Watch deep throat this dick all night
