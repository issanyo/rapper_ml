Reporter:
Federal authorities say it works like this
The drugs are moved in bulk across the Mexican border
To hub cities like Atlanta where its broken down in warehouses, shipped to other cities, and broken down again, where it’s sold on the streets
The cash goes back to the hub cities where its packaged and shipped back to the Cartel leaders in Mexico

[Hook: Juicy J]
Cocaine is a hell of a drug
Mexico keep a hell of a plug
Pack up the truck put the drugs on a forklift
I'mma show you bitch niggas how we do this
You got the fish scale, I got the cash
Let's swap it out, let's do it fast
You got the fish scale, I got the cash
Let's swap it out, let's do it fast

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I was riding with a connecter guy on my way to Georgia bruh
Meet up with this nigga for some keys out of Florida
Im riding with this fool I ain't known this nigga about 2 months
He talking on his cell speaking in Spanish I'm like aww fuck
(Spanish)
What that nigga say?
(Spanish)
Man I ain't playing
(Spanish)
Here we go again
(Spanish)
I'mma do him in
I pulled a 44 from my draws then I started blasting
I hit him in the neck he started shaking he was gacking
I shot him in the head, then I took his body to a ditch
I respect the dead but I disrespect the set up snitch

(Hook)

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I’m still riding down to Georgia man, I hustle for the money
This nigga tried to set me up, they have to give me something
I done murked my connect, tell you whats next
Somebody gonna get smoked like cigarettes
Cuz I'm never slipping kept my old rusted tech
Underneath the seat for a cold bloody mess
Just before I knew I saw an undercover 'vette
Lights flashing crazy im like holy shit

Officer: Get your ass out the car, and get your ass on the ground
Juicy J: I know somebody saw me dump the body I can’t go down
Officer: I said Get your ass out the car, and get your ass on the ground
Juicy J: I'm surrounded by five more cars it’s the end now

Officer: We belive the suspect has just shot himself in the head
Black male, blood all over the windows can't really see inside
Send an ambulance to 46 and I-20, male is in a white rental truck
Probably one of them drug runners again
