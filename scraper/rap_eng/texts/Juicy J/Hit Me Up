(Intro)
Yeah Bro, Yeah Bro, Yeah Bro

(Hook)
All these niggas got so much to say
Well call me when they start talkin' money
All these bitches got so much to say
Well call me when they start talkin' money
I say call me when they start talkin' money
Go on hit me up
I say call me when they start talkin' money
Gon hit me up
All these people got so much to say
Well call me when they start talkin' money
Gon hit me up

(Verse 1)
Nigga fund start runnin' low you know how they do
They never wanna blame they self they blame it all on you
I handle my business, I can't handle yours too
They can't talk me out my fuckin' money now they wanna sue
Nigga get off yo ass you can't walk in my shoes
Back when I was in the mud nigga where the fuck was you?
Mane this game so fake, first they love you then they hate you
Rappers diss you on the tape but in the street they scared to face you
You can't trust these record labels, ain't no friends in this shit
Niggas with you 'til they do a interview then they switch
Now they got so much to say, they on twitter throwin' shade
I don't pay that shit no mind, I'm too busy getting paid

(Hook)
All these niggas got so much to say
Well call me when they start talkin' money
All these bitches got so much to say
Well call me when they start talkin' money
I say call me when they start talkin' money
Go on hit me up
I say call me when they start talkin' money
Gon' hit me up
All these people got so much to say
Well call me when they start talkin' money
Gon' hit me up
