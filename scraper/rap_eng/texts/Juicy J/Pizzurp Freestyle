(Verse)
I was twisting up some pizzurp
She showing me that hip work
Bad bitches make this dick work
Hope she don’t leave my dick hurt
Yo mama, I’m yo daddy
I’m that trick that’s in the alley
And I still miss John Hill
We used to clown like John Salley
That woulda been the first Nigga that
I woulda took wit me to the valley
Still in power wit Kyrie
They’ll never separate the family
RJ it’s our way, Asia told us bring it home and what is Dime without the 9
Boo Kiara swapping phones
Keisha off the leash yea
Ain’t Tanisha put me on
Wild yes I’m still a child yea
Uncle E know I’m blown
Rina hard like Tina
Bring my Uncle Lonnie home
Peedie I know you see me
I’m rocking in San Anton
Brittany look like missy
Yes I miss being home
Mel bring em all hell
Tell them thirsty hoes chome
CJ give em replays
And stay hard like the chrome
Maria to Shenia Telaysia and Taniya
Pray for big cuz
Cuz I’m out here getting higher
Searching for the red lighter
Since what it do zompire
Still working with the choir
Water I’m not a fighter
Easy beats came with the free bass (yea)
Like Richard Pryor
If I waste more time on bullshit
I’m richer prior
If I don’t elaborate the whole thing
I’m still a liar
And I’m burning that forest that green
I’m still on fire
Wondering who the fuck sent me
The empire

(Verse 2)
Been trill working wheels
I’m a sympathetic pimp
And you know
I stay higher than a Goodyear blimp
Shoulda known what it was
When they first saw my limp
Drop the hammer like the judge
Now she cooking me shrimp
I would smash in the back seat
At night with the tint
Get dress and leave fresher
Than a ice flavored mint
Tell them hoes I’m far from done
And no this ain’t no stint
Might just move back home
Bring water near flint
Don’t know how we can spend time
If it’s already spent
Something bulging in my pocket and you know that ain’t lint
Still dipping on these hoes
And you know I got chips
And I would put that on crip
But you know Riv not a crip
And Yeah yea that’s right cuz
And I’ll put it on blood
Cause I would put it on blood
But you know Riv not a blood
You know Riv in a higher place
I’m like up here above
And yeah I seen me a mansion
But I ain’t see no thugs
And yea we want expansions
2 v’s connect up
I don’t even know why I even stopped
Tell them hoes to bless up
I be doing push ups smoking kush
That’s kush ups
Everytime she get my dick hard
We call it pull ups
And I gotta stop gassing hoes
Cause I forgot to fill up
Don’t be looking at my eyes
To see if I’m sleep
I’m still up
They want me to do it legal
No need for a dealer
Just bring it and break it down
They know who was iller
