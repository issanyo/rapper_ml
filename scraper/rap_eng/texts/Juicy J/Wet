The money make her wet, make her wet, make her wet
I like my pussy wet, I like it wet, I like it wet
Run a pussy nigga, I leave you wet, I leave you wet
New paint job and they gotta be wet

The money make her wet, make her wet, make her wet
I like my pussy wet, I like it wet, I like it wet
Run a pussy nigga, I leave you wet, I leave you wet
Any whip I'm in, paint job gotta be wet

[Verse 1]
Shawty got that wet, wet, my bankroll got 'em upset
I pull up in that new thing, you can look but you can't touch that
Shawty leaking like a faucet, I ain't even brush yet
You just spent your check on this lil bitch and you ain't fuck yet
Damn , this paint on this chevy is drippin
To park it I don't even whip it
Most of you niggas is tripping cause most of you niggas don't listen
Walk in the club and the bitches be on me cause all of 'em know I be tipping
Pull off in a Bentley, when you see me later, I probably be in something different
Pull up on 'em, disappear, can't even see 'em in the rear
It just so damn loud when it roar, nigga can't even hear
Shawty all in my ear, she wanna do it right here
Shawty mouth so wet that it made me shed a tear

[Hook]
The money make her wet, make her wet, make her wet
I like my pussy wet, I like it wet, I like it wet
Run a pussy nigga, I leave you wet, I leave you wet
New paint job and they gotta be wet

The money make her wet, make her wet, make her wet
I like my pussy wet, I like it wet, I like it wet
Run a pussy nigga, I leave you wet, I leave you wet
Any whip I'm in, paint job gotta be wet

[Verse 2]
That 223 gon' leave you wet nigga, that's why you should pay your debts nigga
How you gon' come up with 7 figures, got a better chance of seeing heaven nigga
My Bentley coupe, it look like ocean water
I dropped the top, it look like open water, bitch
I hit the shop and spent another quarter
My pay so wet, look like a Mexican crossing the border
My bitch wet, whip wet and my 'fif too
You can't walk in my shoes, it won't fit you
Nigga I don't fuck with 12, 6 times 2
Unless you talking 12 gauge, I won't miss you

[Hook]
The money make her wet, make her wet, make her wet
I like my pussy wet, I like it wet, I like it wet
Run a pussy nigga, I leave you wet, I leave you wet
New paint job and they gotta be wet

The money make her wet, make her wet, make her wet
I like my pussy wet, I like it wet, I like it wet
Run a pussy nigga, I leave you wet, I leave you wet
Any whip I'm in, paint job gotta be wet
