[Intro]
My nigga it's been a grind, you know what I'm sayin'? This shit didn't just happen over night, you know what I'm sayin' my nigga? This all was a hustle, a plan. Real shit
Yeah, so
Learn from the best man
Bitch

[Chorus]
I do numbers, bitch
I do numbers, hoe
I be thumbin', bitch
That's how I'm comin', hoe
Check them numbers, bitch
Fifty thou on my wrist
'Cause I do numbers, hoe
Another fifty rounds in the clip
I do numbers, bitch
I do numbers, hoe
I be thumbin', bitch
That's how I'm comin', hoe
So check them numbers, bitch
Fifty thou on my bitch
'Cause I do numbers, hoe
350 thou on a whip

[Verse 1]
I been doin' them numbers
Cashin' out every summer
Nine to eight, I was feelin' like Cash Money, got me a Hummer (Weezy)
Backseat with yo' woman
I got bread, no wonder
You call like "Where ya at?"
She like "Hold on, I'm comin'"
How you bomin', bitch?
That's that blood talk
How you comin', bitch?
That's how my cubs talk
You want drama on my mama, ain't no love lost
I got hunters and they comin', you got blood loss, bitch!

[Chorus]
I do numbers, bitch
I do numbers, hoe
I be thumbin', bitch
That's how I'm comin', hoe
Check them numbers, bitch
Fifty thou on my wrist
'Cause I do numbers, hoe
Another fifty rounds in the clip
I do numbers, bitch
I do numbers, hoe
I be thumbin', bitch
That's how I'm comin', hoe
So check them numbers, bitch
Fifty thou on my bitch
'Cause I do numbers, hoe
350 thou on a whip

[Verse 2]
I drop 28 on a scale, that's a onion, bro
Made a quarter in the winter, double my summer, hoe
Is you fuckin', bitch?
You know you want this dick
I hit the club, 50 and dubs on my stuntin' shit
When the smoke lit, I was platinum, check my numbers bitch
Let me see yo' tongue ring, give me yo' number bitch
Who run? We run
You ain't on nothing, hoe
I was sippin' on some sizzurp, runnin' up the score

[Chorus]
I do numbers, bitch
I do numbers, hoe
I be thumbin', bitch
That's how I'm comin', hoe
Check them numbers, bitch
Fifty thou on my wrist
'Cause I do numbers, hoe
Another fifty rounds in the clip
I do numbers, bitch
I do numbers, hoe
I be thumbin', bitch
That's how I'm comin', hoe
So check them numbers, bitch
Fifty thou on my bitch
'Cause I do numbers, hoe
350 thou on a whip

[Outro]
Man, I has some serious, serious prostitutes. I mean, top of the line, you know. It wasn't none of this hundred dollar stuff. I mean, we really had girls bringin' in five, ten thousand dollars a night and stuff. People thought I was so big like a drug dealer. That's how fast I was gettin' money
