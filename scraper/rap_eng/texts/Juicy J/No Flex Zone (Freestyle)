[Hook: Swae Lee]
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
Won a gold medal
And a gold bezel
I treat it so special
Now your ho jealous
Freak Hoes got several
They tens or better
I’m a trendsetter
I’m a go-getter

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Rolex on
Lambo gone
I'm flyer than a asteroid weed on steroids that's that strong
I ball out bitch come catch me
Thirsty ass bitch don't sweat me
I just wanna fuck yo face, fuck yo name Ima call you Becky
My watch, my rings
You know what I drank
That sprite, put it on ice
Got freezer burn on my chain
Popstar she tryna hide in my range
She don't wanna be in no pictures
We ain't trying to be in no TMZ
She just trying to gobble this dick up
Call her phone she can't pickup
I shoot it in her face it's a stickup
I walked in through a couple bandz til my jeweler tell em don't hit em like my bitch up
Bitch I'm getting to the bread like a pigeon
Plus I got loud pack all in my system
Trippy stick bitch I don't smoke no swishers
And I'm on that ass like bumper stickers
Pick up with the pussy killer
She scream so loud you would think I killed her
Soon as I'm done I'd have to dismiss her
30 minutes later here comes her sister
Pimp shit nigga I'm rich they know
I smoke they blow
Juicy J I'm bout to go and buy a tour bus just for all of my hoes
