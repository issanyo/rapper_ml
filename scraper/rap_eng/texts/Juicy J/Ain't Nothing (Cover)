[Intro: Yamine]
Yeah, uh huh
Nigga, I got the black card, finna swipe this shit

[Verse 1: Yamine]
This that higher level stunting, make it rain a lot of hundreds
Gave that chick 30k to go get rid of her stomach
I'm a triple OG nigga 12 years and running
All my niggas down to ride like crash test dummies
And Y don't stand in line, I ain't never never had to wait
I'm the realest in this game, I ain't never had to fake
Forgiatos on the classic like that bitch got on some skates
Having dinner with Obama smelling like a pound of hay
I might blow a pound a day, smoking KK like a hippie
In the 60's with this chick, tryna give my dick a hickey
Had to get it out the mud, no wonder why I'm filthy rich
And I'm running through this money
Like it don't mean nothing to me, I might

[Hook: Yamine]
Buy the highest bottle like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll buy 20 bottles worth of clothes like it ain't nothing
Drop a hundred thou' like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll go and buy a brand new car like it ain't nothing
Buy a new crib like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll go and buy a ton of bad bitches like it ain't nothing
Pull a hundred hoes, man it ain't nothing
When you getting money, stacks chips ain't nothing

[Verse 2: Yamine]
Pull up in the lowrider two hoes behind us
Police say that they can smell it but I make sure they don't find it
Hit the corner, slide the ash, Young Yamine bout his cash
'Bout to build another whip and I ain't even got to brag
Three women got that bitch leanin'
Young Yamine got the women screamin'
Done deal, done deal
When I pull up, It's a done deal
Lift the trunk, still rolling up
And I got one in the front, two in the back
Do what I want, don't need to relax
King of my city, I'm living to show 'em
I cannot be even, three wheelin' in traffic
This '61 I'm building 'bout to be a classic
I'm repping Taylor Gang â€“ they asking; paper or plastic?

[Hook: Yamine]
Buy the highest bottle like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll buy 20 bottles worth of clothes like it ain't nothing
Drop a hundred thou' like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll go and buy a brand new car like it ain't nothing
Buy a new crib like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll go and buy a cougar bad bitch like it ain't nothing
Pull a hundred hoes, mane it ain't nothing
When you getting money, smashin', she don't say nothing

[Verse 3: Yamine]
(Yeah , Ey Mike-Will, I got [??] , check this out)
Getting paid like ghost do
In the street, in the club too
Designer everything, Ric Flair
I can buy the rap game, brick fair
Buy the bar, smoke that caviar, I'm in the finest car
Push to start, I glow in the dark, I run up the charts
Redbone, vanilla, freaky broad, she gon' keep me hard
Black car, better play it smart, nigga we in charge
Get paid, young nigga get paid
And I run the game like a fucking arcade
If we talking money then I got a raise
Drink so strong, they think I got it laced

[Hook: Yamine]
Buy the highest bottle like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll buy 20 bottles worth of clothes like it ain't nothing
Drop a hundred thou' like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll go and buy a brand new car like it ain't nothing
Buy a new crib like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll go and buy a cougar bad bitch like it ain't nothing
Pull a hundred hoes, mane it ain't nothing
When you getting money, smashin', she don't say nothing

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah
