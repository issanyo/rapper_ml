[Intro]
Ayy, mmm
Woop woop

[Hook]
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out
Look at shawty wavin' at me with her titties out
Look at all the ass she got sittin' out
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out
Errtime I slide through I bring the city out
Errtime I slide through I bring the biddy out

[Verse 1]
This that Maybach music, I need Ross on it
S650, I'mma floss on it
Don't wet it up, throw the sauce on it
For the inside I double what it cost on it
I don't need a sun roof I got stars in it
Mine paid for nigga, y'alls rented
I could prolly fit a couple more broads in it
Nobody see you through the window cause they all tinted
Pull them curtains black, she pop another Percocet
Count up another check right before she gave me neck
I let the seats back, baby where the weed at?
I'm try'na free my mind, you know I need that

[Hook]
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out
Look at shawty wavin' at me with her titties out
Look at all the ass she got sittin' out
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out
Errtime I slide through I bring the city out
Errtime I slide through I bring the biddy out

[Verse 2]
It's paid for, no leases nigga
My bankroll obese nigga
V12, I skates on police nigga
Yeah cause they be hatin' on a OG nigga
Wet paint goin' OC
So they can see theyself hatin' on me
A couple of wet bitches waitin' on me
And they can see theyself layin' on me
When I pull up in that thang it make them nervous
Got a driver, you can get that front door service
I can't let you drive that thang, girl just gon' be nervous
Hit the gass on they ass and get to swervin'
And we go 0 to 100 on the way to the money
I don't do this shit for nothin'
Cash money I be stuntin'
Got Chanel on my seat
Got Chanel on my feet
V12 in the hood
I leave 12 in the street

[Hook]
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out
Look at shawty wavin' at me with her titties out
Look at all the ass she got sittin' out
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out
I wonder when they gon bring the 650 out
Errtime I slide through I bring the city out
Errtime I slide through I bring the biddy out

[Outro]
It ain't too many niggas built like me
Where I can look a girl in the face and say
"Do you want to suck my dick?
Do you want to have sex with me?
Yes or no"
And if the bitch say no, "aight bye good luck"
I'm not tryna get to know you
What we exchanging numbers for?
I'm not keeping in contact
I don't even be on my phone
I play Pokemon GO more than I text these hoes, you know what I'm saying
