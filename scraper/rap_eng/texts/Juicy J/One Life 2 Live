[Intro]

[Verse 1 : Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
I got one life to live
You see, I'm stayin' up off the streets
Weed, Heineken drinkin', that Louie 13
It keeps a major league
Playa on that hustle type
Big baller with so much clout
Keys in my lap, police in the rearview
Put 'em on a high speed, then bail out
I'm not afraid cause I got heart
Runnin' through the woods to the graveyard
Helicopters on my trail, I slipped and fell
Plus it's gettin' dark
Now what do ya know ?
I heard two barrels cocking on my shoulder
They found the dope I was laying on
When they turned me over
I'm mad as fuck cause the cuffs tight on my hands
I'm takin' an ass whoopin', dreamin' for the ambulance
I'm in the squad car, depressed cause I'm caught with dirt
They finna hide my ass, I wonder is it worth it
I called on God, but his phone must be off the hook
I feel a evil spirit tellin' me to go out like a crook
And kick the window out the pecker-wood he gone shoot to kill
I'm out of patience, I got one life to live

[Verse 2 : DJ Paul]
Stayin' on my fuckin' shoes
Livin' by them Three Six rules
Keepin' all Atlanta down
Bustas what you tryin' to prove ?
Smokin' green by the P's
Fuck what you sayin' punk
Prophet Posse get my back
Cristale is gettin' me drunk
Thangs still the same
Ain't gon' change
Like you Foster's beez
Niggas down one day and not the next
Nothin' but hoes to me
Playa brought you in this game
A playa take you out this thang
Stayin' real wit' you homies mane
It'll always bring a thang

[Verse 3 : Juicy J]
I only got one life to live but now I gotta get it straight
Tryna make a living in my city so don't playa hate
If you got a question how a Memphis nigga money flow
Shootin' craps, selling dope, kicking in niggas door
Ballin' down the strip with a trunk full of hot shit
Talkin' on the burner phone, bumpin' hutch, sweatin' the bitch
That's how we do it in the M-town
Niggas frown
Im all about my hustle
If you got no cheese don't come around

[Verse 4 : Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Yeah, and like that 2Pac I feel death around the corner sometimes
I'm placed in perfect
Im spooked as fuck if I ain't packing my nine
I'm in that strip with my niggas I just made bond
When I was locked up I got hooked up on a lumpsum of game
From a Cuban, how to get my ass in
Help me feed my children
That drought got me selling that dope again
I'm boomin'
I'm tryna think of some legit to wash my money off
I'm gonna miss these streets, my back against the wall
Damn it feels good to be a Kingpin
I got a hook up from my cuz, nigga what, blow it up
No cut
A playa hater trippin' wit' that bull shit
The bird on my triple beam always weight thirty-six
My word is bond, man to man, face to face
I'm on my way to incarceration with Fed time
To squash my case
I fronted of my homies hoping that they can see that I was real
Years, it's some motherfucker with one life to live
