[Verse 1: Yamine & (Isaac The Rapper)]
What these niggas on,, hand me my chrome
Goin back to snatching niggas out they Cadillac and send them home
(Smoke em' like a bong, then its back to counting money when I'm stoned)
Or I send a hit through the phone and my dudes will come get you and they'll never leave you alone
(My niggas official like refs with a whistle, I just make one call back to top off your dome)
Off with your head, bitch I'm a king I got shooters with 2's protecting my throne
(One shot then you gone, you should've known. I'm a real nigga I cannot be cloned)
I'm filthy rich still don't let a penny go
(I be up all night like I'm Arsenio)
Freaky bitches take the dick in any whole
(Now they famous cause they in my video)
Who you foolin' I don't buy
(I don't judge I just go off vibes)
When I touch the sky then hop in this ride
(Yamine Gang nigga we don't die)
This world is mine I delete you guys
(We all tryna eat we don't need your kind)
And get that cash but family first
(Be prepared to grind nigga put in work)
Fuck nigga what would you do for this ice
(You think its really worth losing your life)
How bad you want stripes, my young niggas killers
(If I give the word then they smashing you niggas)
Bunch of youngins' coming from a broken home
(Slanging rock n roll but ain't no rolling stone)
Streets welcome niggas in with open arms
(If I catch the charge I'm a post a bond)
You god damn right I'm a certified boss I can cut the check or I can cut your throat
(Put you on the table tag on your toe smoking weed till' I overdose)
You don't want beef you ain't thinking clear. I'm too busy tryna make a fucking village
(Dripping more cheese then a chicken Philly, Pittsburgh niggas really bout they business)
I got niggas with me don't got any feelings
(They just really wit it, they just into killing)
Hard as hell on the internet but nigga in the streets you like Richard Simmons
(My money long and my passport got more stamps then a nigga mail)
It ain't a problem if I catch a body then I'm heading over seas I'll never see a sail nigga!
MAFIA
(GANG!)
