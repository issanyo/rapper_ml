[Intro]
All lives matter
My prayers go out to all the families and all the victims
This shit need to stop mane, real shit mane

[Hook]
Nigga got a hundred pills, tryna pay the bills
Get a hundred years, where the justice at?
White boy, same charge, shed a couple tears
Never see a cell, where the justice at?
Catch you with that bomb, you not going home
You ain't got no bond, where the justice at?
And cops will gun you down, cause you tryna run
Swear they saw a gun, where the justice at?

[Verse 1]
We just tryna get some money, can you blame a nigga?
Tryna make it out the mud, they wanna hang a nigga
They wanna take our freedom and put chains on us
We ain't all equal, they runnin game on us
Crooked politicians and private prisons
Give a nigga life sentence cause it's all business
He just tryna put some food on the table
And take care of his babies and his pregnant old lady
Laws pulled him over cause he ran a stop sign
He ain't even strapped, he'll probably still get shot down
Tried to call his lawyer cause he thought he had rights
Cops shot a nigga dead cause he fear for his life

[Hook]
Nigga got a hundred pills, tryna pay the bills
Get a hundred years, where the justice at?
White boy, same job, shed a couple tears
Never see a cell, where the justice at?
Catch you with that bomb, you not going home
You ain't got no bond, where the justice at?
And cops will gun you down, cause you tryna run
Swear they saw a gun, where the justice at?

[Verse 2]
You ain't safe at home, you ain't safe at work
If you black, you ain't even safe at church
You ain't got a case even on tape
Watch 'em kill a man on Instagram and still get away
We ain't got no peace, we ain't got no peace of mind
Everyday we leave the house, we're out here fighting for our lives
Born black with a target on your back
Where they shoot you over nothing then still wonder why you strapped
Came home from the feds, and he right back in the trap
Who the fuck gon' hire you? My nigga it's a wrap
You a felon and you lucky if they even shake your hand
Mane you crazy if you think they giving us a second chance

[Hook]
Nigga got a hundred pills, tryna pay the bills
Get a hundred years, where the justice at?
White boy, same job, shed a couple tears
Never see a cell, where the justice at?
Catch you with that bomb, you not going home
You ain't got no bond, where the justice at?
And cops will gun you down, cause you tryna run
Swear they saw a gun, where the justice at?

[Outro]
Mane, where the justice at?
Where the justice at?
Where the justice at?
You know everything ain't really about race man
It's motherfuckers out here just doin what the fuck they wanna do
And thats fucked up
Where the justice at?
