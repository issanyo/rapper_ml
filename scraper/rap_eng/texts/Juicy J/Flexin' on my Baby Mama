[Intro/Outro]
I said I take care of my kids but I'm flexin' on my baby mama
I'm like, "Damn, I shoulda wore a condom!"
Boom, boom, boom

[Verse 1]
My shoes sold out in one day
Pull out the blueprint, bumpin' dat Gunplay
In a Maybach, pockets stay fat
So fly, I could parallel park on a fucking runway
Going down a one way the wrong way, shoot barrel long range
Swag like pro ball, gave her a ring, phone call
Money talk, pole vault, walked in, drove off
So comfortable at the dealership, I don't take my robe off
I wake up and I get to it, breakfast time I might sea food it
Lunch time I might lamb chop it
And you do is talk shit like you was eatin' booty
Southside in my bloodstream, smokin' on that propane
I could tell ya ass one thing, I like gettin' head wearing both chains
All white with no stains, I been trappin' fore the Grammy nods
I been countin' money so long I'mma need a damn hand massage
So many cars, I can barely park
So many cars, I need another damn garage
I'm famous with my fam around, damn I wish I had my dad around
Gave a nigga a Lamborghini, so that's a motherfuckin' lamb-me-down

[Chorus]
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
I'm just flexin' on my baby mama
(I'm just flexin')
I'm just flexin' on my baby mama
(I'm just flexin')
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
I'm just flexin' on my baby mama
(I'm just flexin')
I'm just flexin' on my baby mama
(I'm just flexin')

[Verse 2]
Aye, European style my dresscode, gunshots in the club echo
Walk around with a .36 with six shots in my .38 Special
Black car, black Timbs, Bank of America back then
She tryna tell me her life story and all I want is a lap dance
Good times, smokin' J's, rockin' J's, I'm the rap Ernie Barnes
If I paint a canvas it'd be melee, firearms
Viacom, maric√≥n, if she bad I invite her home
Buying chains like I'm buyin' homes
Rims taller than Kevin Hart, Ride Along
Them rhinestones, you ain't shinin', nigga
I ain't hidin' so you ain't gotta find me, nigga
All my clothes are designer, nigga
And my back seat recliner nigga
Came in rockin' all gold and I'm fuckin' all yall hoes
Smokin' on that Lee Haney, sippin' on that hard-boiled
This that get back - click clack, get back
Smokin' on Raw paper, this ain't zig zags
Snakeskin wallpaper, rose gold chandelier
I'm lookin' for a baby eater, can I get a volunteer?

[Chorus]
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
I'm just flexin' on my baby mama
(I'm just flexin')
I'm just flexin' on my baby mama
(I'm just flexin')
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
I'm just flexin' on my baby mama
(I'm just flexin')
I'm just flexin' on my baby mama
(I'm just flexin')

[Outro/Intro]
I said I take care of my kids but I'm flexin' on my baby mama
I'm like "Damn, I shoulda wore a condom!"
Boom, boom, boom
