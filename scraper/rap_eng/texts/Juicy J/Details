[Hook]
I got details in Columbia
All my goons kill, they hunnas bruh
If you ain't down to ride, what you comin' for
If you tryna take mine, you ain't dead enough
I got details in Columbia
All my goons kill, they hunnas bruh
If you ain't down to ride, what you comin' for
If you tryna take mine, you ain't dead enough

[Verse 1]
Niggas tryna take mine, you blind?, you dead?, you niggas ain't hear what I said
I said nigga tryna take mine, I'll cut your hands off, can't finger your bitch, can't beat your dick, can't talk to the feds but a nigga like this, you crazy
I wish you knew about me, my life nigga
UFC, Juicy ain't about that life nigga
CEO, with the choppers in my desk
Niggas want a war, I got a office full of techs
A closet full of bombs, my office like the streets
Juicy J get so hot, pounds never touch my feet
I talk behind my back, to hear the realest nigga breathin'
Its always to the money where ever I put my key in

If you ain't down to ride, what you comin' for
If you tryna take mine, you ain't dead enough

[Verse 2]
Everybody wanna be a millionaire
Till they find out I been running with the killionaires
It's contracts to get shit done
Bomb attached to get a hit done
Your life on a compact disc, I'ma load this shit up, yea nigga I blow this much
Where your momma live, who your sister fuck, where your baby momma get paid to dick suck
Scared ass nigga with the hiccups
I'm in your rear view mirror, chillin' bruh
Starin' at your phone, knowin' its your life if you pick up
Goons at your breakfast table, I dare you to wake up
The trigger ain't got no heart, behind it ain't got no love
And I don't give a fuck, what your life we thought it was
It was just like week, when you was thought you was Noriega
I remember, any nigga can get touched, Noriega
