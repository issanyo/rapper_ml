(Lord Infamous)
You got thugs on ya spot
Fresh out the box
The crowd so live
They comin' in flocks

(All)
Cuz, it's big business, it big business bitch
It's big business, it big business bitch (X2)

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
As I cut, guts poor
Blood washes from the shore
To the sand, as a thousand veins
Slither through my hand
Can I withstand a man
From the underland of pain
As his brains, hit the grains
And I bury the remains, with my fangs
Piercing through a bitches jugular
Infamous bang with psychotic serial killers
The triple six murderers
Not leaving enough to put in a tea cup
When I'm ready to cook, and I rip up the hook
Cause these niggas be took bout that Infamous crook
And the Mafia villains would fuck up a rookie
Drop him to his knees with a N-I-N-E
Slug, gets dug
And bloody up your mug
Because me really love to make a stang
Mr. high capper don't make me touch ya mane
I got the scope, but not the kind that kills bad breath
I got the kind that likes to fuck up ya good health
Everybody in this bitch lets rip some shit up
Tear da club up thugs
On ya spot, put 'em up

(Repeat chorus 2x)

(D. J. Paul)

I kill, kill, kill
I murder, murder, murder
Hater's in my face
Watch a nigga hurta
40, 40, cal
I pull out my back pocket
I grab you by your neck
I pull it out a socket
Range, Range, Range
Rover, Rover, Rover
Blow this fuckin' task
Police pull me over
But I blast on these hoes
Cause I'm too fuckin dangerous
Prophet the Posse
I doubt you hoes could hang wit us
Killin all you nigga's is a easy task
You fools that last
I bullet proof a mazz on dat ass, I dash
To yo muthafuckin crib
Soon as I find out where you live
Flashlights see yo face
Mario a murder case
Roamin through the muthafuckin Black Haven area
Prophet is my Posse, I doubt you see something scarer
Plenty talk shit, but they ain't nothing but
Characters
$100,000 cars now how you gon laugh at us

(Repeat chorus 2x)

(Juicy J)

First I wanna grab a nigga by his neck
Drag him to my fuckin set
Take a nigga blow, and his cheese, and dem cigarettes
Put the gun up to his nose
Tie him up from head to toe
Strap his body in a bag
Throw him in a fire
Call my nigga's Dee and Blue
Project Pat, ya'll know what to do
Creep through dem streets
Wit dem thangs, blast on any fools
Tear da club up thugs, in this muthafucker runnin'
Shit
If you want to playa hate the click
Then your done with
Know'n we ain't going bitch
Makin' fakers dig a ditch
Scare familys in the night
Make'm pull the panic switch
Comin like Titanic trick
Holycaust wit a grip
Crazyndalazdaz I'm bout to have a fuckin fit
Hold me back don't let me go
I'm high as hell and on the road
Nigga I break off in ya house
And boot yo baby wit a pole
Lunatic superstitious, on the corner like I'm pimpin
If I see ya on the block, I'm fuckin
Fuckin wit the quickness

(Lord Infamous)
You got the thugs on ya spot
