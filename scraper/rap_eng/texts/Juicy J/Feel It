Say, I'm at the bar, gonna have a barre
Sippin Ketel One, stumblin to the car
But I don't wanna leave cause it's too crunk
And these girls got a lotta junk in the trunk
Red bones (red bones), black bones (black bones)
White chocolates (chocolates), big tones (big tones)
Breakin them backs, it's on
I'm a gigolo and it's gone
A freak of the week, tryna get a piece
She better know how the boom stay wit the beat
All on the floor, I gotta get this
Shakin that ass and I'm all in her ear sayin
I'm in the club, gettin wasted
Drink so much, I cain't even taste it
Girls on the floor, I gotta get this
Shakin that ass and I'm all in her ear sayin

And bring it back just for the hood sake
Still spendin gwap for the women, they fly
Reppin the bottom, ain't got it, no lie
Travel the world in the G4 alot

Rock to the beat like my {?} catch a vibe
Give me that heat 'tll we all feel the fire
