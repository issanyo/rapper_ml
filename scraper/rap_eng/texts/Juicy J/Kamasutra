[Intro: Cardi B]
No bitch got a mouth like me
No bitch got a pussy like me
The fuck!
Bitches can't suck dick like me
Rap and spit on the dick at the same time
Fuck outta here

[Chorus: Juicy J & Cardi B]
Boy, you better fuck me all night
Boy, you better fuck me all night
Boy, you better fuck me all night
All night, all night
Boy, you better fuck me all night
Boy, you better fuck me all night
Boy, you better fuck me all night
All night, all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
All night, all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
All night, all night

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Suck my balls, lick my nuts, pop this Xan, hit this dust
I know how to fuck, I ain't never gon' bust
In these hoes, I ain't never gon' trust
Pour Champagne on all these sluts
Head so good, gotta keep in touch
Throw that wood, 'til I drive the bitch nuts, I put it in her guts
She keep beggin' me to hit it raw, I outline that pussy in chalk
Hold my dick, a deadly weapon, damn right I break the law
Right before she threw it back, I threw dick up in her jaw
She can have a nigga hooked, but I'ma fuck and cut her off
I know your bitch want that gangsta dick
She take the shit, my paper thick
I take a bitch, never save a bitch
Wraith a bitch, never rape a bitch
She lick the top, lick the sides, take a trip, take a ride
She say she can take a dick then she hit me with this line

[Chorus: Juicy J & Cardi B]
Boy, you better fuck me all night
Boy, you better fuck me all night
Boy, you better fuck me all night
All night, all night
Boy, you better fuck me all night
Boy, you better fuck me all night
Boy, you better fuck me all night
All night, all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
All night, all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
All night, all night

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
You don't know nann hoe (ah-ha)
That been to places I been (I been)
That blew the bag that I spent (I spent)
Had a nigga fuck me and my best friend (ah-ha)
Jump on top then I do a little spin (spin)
Look back at it then I give a little grin (grin)
Give a nigga superhead like Karrine
Pussy so deep, you gon' drown or gon' swim (splash, splash!)
I see you swimpin', ready to ooh, want to put the tip in?
You got me doin' the moves that I used to do
Back in the days when I was strippin' (woo)
Baby, I'm hot, I'm fresh out the kitchen
Won't you come put your key in my ignition? (ah)
You got a bitch, but we different
I keep on ridin', you blew out her engine (skrr! skrr!)
You know I'm the trillest, you know I'm the best boy (best boy)
Caution sign, on slippery, when wet boy (splash, spash)
Come on baby, I'm exactly what them boys like
No playin' games daddy, suck and fuck you all night

[Chorus: Juicy J & Cardi B]
Boy, you better fuck me all night
Boy, you better fuck me all night
Boy, you better fuck me all night
All night, all night
Boy, you better fuck me all night
Boy, you better fuck me all night
Boy, you better fuck me all night
All night, all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
All night, all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
Girl, you better fuck me all night
All night, all night
