I been working, working, working, working hard
Every, every, every, every day, day, day
I been working, working, working, working hard
Every, every, every, every day, day, day, day
Working, working, working, working hard, working hard
Every, every, every, every day, day, day, day
Working, working, working, working hard, working hard
Every, every, every, every day, day, day, day

[Verse 1]
I been working, working, working, working harder than a bitch
Got my homies with me balling, you can call that an assist
Watch me kick some dope shit
Like its all in a wrist
I might trip yo girlfriend, bet she fall on the dick
I got goonies, I got shooters on standby
Watch how quick I pull up like a landmine
I just broke up off my lil shawty, 90k like it ain't shit
Told her bring me back a pound of kush, and she can keep the rest
I got roaches in my ashtray, I'm bugging
Make yo bottom bitch wipe my kicks, if I scuff em
There's big money talking, nigga quiet down and listen
My bad I keep forgetting, you too broke to pay attention

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Running out of room, gotta count it on the floor
Need a money counter cuz my thumbs getting sore
Thumbing through the check, frostbite on my neck
Girl all in my lap, I'm trying not to wreck
2 hunnid on the gadgets this a car or a jet
Shit I'm on some fucking fire, you stand too close you break a sweat
Double cup up in my Aston Martin Prado
Out in LAX, just leaning like a cholo
And I got the iron on me, bitch I'm never solo
Watch how quick I throw a bullet at yo ass, Tony Romo
Rich nigga talking you need to quiet down and listen
God damn I keep forgetting, you too broke to pay attention
