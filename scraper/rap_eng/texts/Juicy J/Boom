[Intro: Robert De Niro]
No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And if you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead

[Hook: Juicy J]
*Boom* *Boom*
I will shoot the whole room, nigga
*Boom* *Boom*
I will shoot the whole room
Got them choppers on deck
Got them goons on deck
Nigga what you wanna do
Nigga what you wanna do
(x2)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Yessir
We gone walked to your house
With these guns out, ready to pop
So called beef, to the hood niggas ready to squash
We're the only goons sellin' dope and we murkin' the block
And niggas steppin' with the shit if your violate drop
If we rip the beam or the chop on machine
AK-47 make you fuck niggas bleed
Throw your gang signs nigga
We don't give a fuck nigga
We gone light ya up nigga
Your head will get cut nigga
Why you talkin' shit nigga
Knowing you was fake nigga
You be with the hate nigga
Starving for a plate nigga
Guess you wanna taste nigga
Off this bullet led nigga
Shoot your mouth up in the hood
You gone be one dead nigga

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: V-Slash]
V-Slash real gangster up in this mothafucka nigga!
Which of yall niggas want to die today?
Don't fuck around, get your issue bitch
Cause I from the slums, I don't give a fuck
I grew up shooting them pistols, bitch
I'm out the gate
I'm ignorant
I kill yo ass, plead innocent
Without witness on this scene
You know what that shit mean?
Without no witness there's no case
Your ass just got it graced
And the damn the fool like me
Just beat the murder case
This shit real with me
Ain't no ho in my blood
A nigga violate me
I'mma show his ass what's up
From the North, and how we get down
And nobody sayin' shit
And if the people come around
Nobody sayin' shit
We sticking with the street code
Ain't nobody feel a snitch
Cause if somebody do
You know what time it is
Nigga
