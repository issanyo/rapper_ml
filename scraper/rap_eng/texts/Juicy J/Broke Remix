[Hook: God]
Dope, coke
You'll make a nigga go broke [x3]
You remind me of dope, coke
You'll make a nigga go broke [x3]
You remind me of dope

[Verse 1: God]
You remind me of dope, coke
One minute you'll be here
The next minute you'll be gone
Have a nigga faded by the end of the song
Get a nigga knocked off and put a nigga on
You remind me of nine straight shots to the dome
38 long getting it gone
Feels so right but you know the shit's wrong
You be in the trap never talking on the phone
You remind me of a nigga getting chrome fourth fifth
I be [?] when you bout to hit a lick
Keep that shit 100 like the drum on the stick
And you keep the shit cheap
You remind me of a brick
When it comes to waiting no struggle just lift
42 deep then blame it on my wrist
You can cook it up I know the way you whip pies
And we just came along with nicks and dimes

[Hook: God]
Dope, coke
You'll make a nigga go broke [x3]
You remind me of dope, coke
You'll make a nigga go broke [x3]
You remind me of dope

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
You remind me of dope, coke
You're tryna fuck a nigga on blow
Hallucinating, getting swollen in your throat
So lost, where I fuck is my soul
Bitch this I gotta know
You the type to make a nigga leave his main thang
Become the plug, set up shop, do the same thang
Go see my jeweler
Drop 200 hundred on a damn chain
Nice watch, four rings
9 yards from a touchdown
Copping 50 choppers with banana rounds
I gotta watch niggas
It's a full-time job not to drop niggas
When everybody got they eyes on the drop, nigga
You remind me of dope, blow
A hole with an ass niggas hooked on
I was pimping that bitch till the bricks sold
Stacking money on the books
Bring my niggas home

[Verse 3: God]
You make me rich and she make you go broke
Play with that dough and I kick in yo door
No you can not get this hoe for the low
Run me that money you know what you are
She looks so good you gonna pay whatever
Been in the hood getting paid forever
She look like Palin I called her so
She call me Maison I'm in margielas
So you know what's on me
There's nothing to smoke you like that
Call a [?] hoes in the alley
[?] the cookies and cheese
I have my bitches fuck you, rob you, leave
You remind me of dope, coke, blow, snow
White cup, ice, purp
Fuck, smoke, fuck, smoke
He don't want to let the bitch go
You remind me of dope
