(Verse 1)
New shoes, all white
Nice girl that’s right
Perfect couple in the light
All this cash in the night
In the place, dancin’
Throwin’ these bandz glancing’
The only thing to do is get money prancin’

(Hook)
Cuz I’m Back in the city
Back, back in the city
Going on tour throwing racks in the city
Cuz I’m back in the city
Back, back in the city
Come from far away where the women are plenty

(Verse 2)
Gold grillz
Sharp hitta
The only thing I do is go get her
Nice rims, nice car
All black, ride around with the tens on
Man I paid something for these J’s
It was worth the money so I can get laid
All this cash isn’t going far away
All I’m doing is tippin’ models all day
Come from a place from towns I say
And Yamine is out for a break
I needed to get away God sake
Out of town right now so I take
Now I get me someplace to go and shake

(Hook)
Cuz I’m Back in the city
Back, back in the city
Going on tour throwing racks in the city
Cuz I’m back in the city
Back, back in the city
Come from far away where the women are plenty (repeat)

(Verse 3)
Ain’t worried bout family
I’m just doing what I’m doin’
I take my time with my money
I’m just out here choosin’
The only girls I talk to is the ones that are provin’ Here’s a cricket for a ticket
I need to get in so I give it
All you need to do is mark my name off
So I can live it
Help some strippers
Pour some bottles
Now it’s all about the models
Watch me drink up and let these bitches go to the bottom

(Hook)
Cuz I’m Back in the city
Back, back in the city
Going on tour throwing racks in the city
Cuz I’m back in the city
Back, back in the city
Come from far away where the women are plenty (repeat)

Going back in the city cuz I’m back

(Hook)
Cuz I’m Back in the city
Back, back in the city
Going on tour throwing racks in the city
Cuz I’m back in the city
Back, back in the city
Come from far away where the women are plenty (repeat)
