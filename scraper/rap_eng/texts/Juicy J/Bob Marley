[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Yessir
D & DMG
We Tripping man (Yeah ooh ooh)

DIV is where you find me at
Higher than the seats on my private jet
Four door Lambo I’m buying that
I’m mad cuz them bitches ain’t designed it yet
I’m smoking on loud tell them bitches be quiet
If a nigga keep hating, he gonna make me start a riot
Could’ve bought a house but I spent it on a ride
And if I get any higher I’m a really start flying
Tell me what you know about that Taylor Gang shit
We be popping champagne just to pour it on our bitches
Leave the club with a girl I ain’t never gonna forget
She slob on my knob but she don’t spit
Get trippy as I roll out with my niggas out in Dallas
Look at Juicy J, he balling like the Mavericks
Me and all my niggas, and a bunch of automatics
If a nigga roll up on me, I’m a let a nigga have it

[Hook: Bob Marley]
Come on and stir it up, I would say little darling
Let’s stir it up, come on baby (we tripping man)
Come on and stir it up, yeah little darling
Stir it up, woah


[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Jet Life, Jet Life
Turbo charged bars, slide cars on tracks falling off gang stars
In these rap wars, ain’t nothing band aids won’t cover
Touring with seven deep coverage, live bands two buses
My own cash no budget, no major label fundings Jets baby
We went from crawling to walking to running you can’t say nothing
You undergag order, hopping out of Audis hurting y’all with kicks
I’m the Transporter, think about it never mind, you ain’t gotta
I’m already on some whole other, word to your motherfucking self
Nobody else gonna do it for you, nobody else every night
Then someone will offer you help but they ain’t doing nothing
Till they really see you trying to do something, I ain’t bluffing
Kush puffing, on you jive turkeys, stuffing stocking with these gifts…

[Hook: Bob Marley]
Come on and stir it up, I would say little darling
Let’s stir it up, come on baby
Come on and stir it up, uh yeah little darling
Stir it up, woah


[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Taylor, uh
Top floor, 454 fully restored, nice wheels red bottoms galore
Being honest they don’t make ‘em like you anymore
We the hottest in my, keep me the calmest
We’ll be dancing with the stars and throwing peace signs at the comets
We’ll be posing for the cameras when they bring us on the carpet
Eating breakfast in the morning while we reading all the comments, like
Ooh girl, oh man y’all see her
Got me like I’m a spend my whole life with you
And make the perfect wife out you, and now them other…

[Hook: Bob Marley]
Come on and stir it up, I would say little darling
Let’s stir it up, come on baby
Come on and stir it up, yeah little darling
Stir it up, woah, ohh ohh
We Trippy Man
