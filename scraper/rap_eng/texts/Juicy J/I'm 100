I'm ballin' in the game, why you haters on the bench?
I'm tryin' to get that Bill Gates money, ain't talkin' 'bout offense
I got plenty D but I don't mean defense
Nigga disrespect? Leave his body with a stitch
I'm ballin' in the game, why you haters on the bench?
I'm tryin' to get that Bill Gates money, ain't talkin' 'bout offense
I got plenty D but I don't mean defense
Nigga disrespect? Leave his body with a stitch
These haters try to knock me but I ain't a dog
Green and white, homie I keep that 9 on me Rondo
Old player with the heat, call me Alonso
Shake a nigga dope and give a fuck if he was John Doe
Got that dirty money spreadin' around like germs
Been blowin' this money from a long turn
I'm burnin' these bitches head like a bad purr
And I've known they put their mouth a whole lot of fern
Ball in on these haters, where my toothpaste?
And when I hit the club, I'm doin' it Bombay
'Bout to run the whole game but I'm no running back
Beat a nigga so bad got him running back
I'm ballin' in the game, why you haters on the bench?
I'm tryin' to get that Bill Gates money, ain't talkin' 'bout offense
I got plenty D but I don't mean defense
Nigga disrespect? Leave his body with a stitch
I'm ballin' in the game, why you haters on the bench?
I'm tryin' to get that Bill Gates money, ain't talkin' 'bout offense
I got plenty D but I don't mean defense
Nigga disrespect? Leave his body with a stitch
Head in the sky, got the booth full of clouds
Shorty come do something to make a nigga proud
Wrote a Laker in my cup, that pessa in my rap
Get around the bitch here, you know it's a rap
They swallowed my kids that's why I don't have any
If I could make 'em from the mouth I'd have plenty
Got that million dollar swag, why you haters mad?
You niggas garbage, now where's the glad bag?
I'm live on TV, you haters watchin' me
She ain't a babysitter but your bitch watchin' me
I'm a charge 'er so bad she gon call off loud
Make her ass tap out, throw in the towel
I'm ballin' in the game, why you haters on the bench?
I'm tryin' to get that Bill Gates money, ain't talkin' 'bout offense
I got plenty D but I don't mean defense
Nigga disrespect? Leave his body with a stitch
I'm ballin' in the game, why you haters on the bench?
I'm tryin' to get that Bill Gates money, ain't talkin' 'bout offense
I got plenty D but I don't mean defense
Nigga disrespect? Leave his body with a stitch
