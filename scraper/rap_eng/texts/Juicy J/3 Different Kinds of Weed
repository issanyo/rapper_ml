(DJ Paul, talking)
Yeah
Crunchy nigga doin' it now mang
You know I'm sayin?
Puttin' these albums and shit out
Mang, ya know I'm sayin?
Now ya got, 3 different kinds of weeds
Know I'm sayin? Mixed in a bowl
Thats like some of that super Bin-Laden type shit (Super!)
Mixin' that shit up, so fuck what'cha bought
Some of this shit mang (Fuck what'cha bought)
Lotta niggas out here be bullshittin'
Talkin' bout they gon' bring you a good bag
To the studio or somethin', by the house
But I don't ever see these niggas
Fuck y'all, fuck what'cha bought man
Wassup man?

(Hook, singing)
Three different kind of weeds
Mixed in a bowl (Mixed in a bowl)
And when I roll one up
I go outta control (I go outta control)
Niggaaa
Three different kind of weeds
Mixed in a bowl (Mixed in a bowl)
And when I roll one up
I go outta control (I go outta control)
Niggaaa

(Verse 1, Crunchy Black)
I'm a motherfuckin' fiend for that Mary Jane
And if ya got that, then ya got me mayn
I promise my smokin' is outta the frame
And I ain't gon' even try to play ya mayn
Can ya let me get some weed, see my check ain't came
And a nigga like me, I ain't playin' games
I need that Mary Jane, I need that Mary Jane
Like a junkie need crack runnin' through his veins
See niggas takin' pills, I mean they poppin' 'em mayn
But can y'all niggas cold, name some names
We holler'd Perkaset, we hollar'd X mayn
I popped a full bar, now I'm outta the frame
See if you got sess, then you got game
Now all you need now, is a freaky lil' dame
To get on her knees, and bless ya thang
It's hard here nigga, don't make me smoke ya mayn

(Hook, singing)
I got three different kind of weeds
Mixed in a bowl (Mixed in a bowl)
And when I roll one up
I go outta control (I go outta control)
Niggaaa
Three different kind of weeds
Mixed in a bowl (Mixed in a bowl)
And when I roll one up
I go outta control (I go outta control)
Niggaaa

(Verse 2, Crunchy Black)
I used to fuck wit' this nigga, I ain't hatin'
A cool white-boy, he did the best that he can
He sold x-pills, bout a hundred man
And played around wit' bout a hundred-grand
He bought me a Q-P of 'Dro, understand?
And I smoked, smoked, smoked like a smoke and a bandit
Y'all don't know how much god damn it
I smoked so much, that the smoke couldn't stand me
I'm just a young nigga, tryina get high
And I'ma gon' smoke til' the day that I die
So roll up the weed, and ignite the fire
And let's get high, nigga let's get high!
I know y'all know we Hypnotize
We have y'all hollerin' out "I-Yi-Yi"
Like the Ying Yang Twin's "Me, Myself, and I"
If ya got three different kind of weed, give it a try!

(Hook, singing)
I got three different kind of weeds
Mixed in a bowl (Mixed in a bowl)
And when I roll one up
I go outta control (I go outta control)
Niggaaa
Three different kind of weeds
Mixed in a bowl (Mixed in a bowl)
And when I roll one up
I go outta control (I go outta control)
Niggaaa
