(Chorus: Carmike)
Carmike, Comin' at yo azz, Comin' at yo azz
(Repeats multiple times)

(Verse 1: Carmike)
I floats like a butterfly, I stings like a bee, I'm as rough and rugged as a motherfucking tree, One, Two, Three and don't forget four, Niggas that I flex, Have them wrestled to the fucking floor, One pop, Two pop, Sweat starts to pop
Then I drop, Skinny Pimp kicked in door and he starts to wreck shop, Was that psychic shit that 2-1-1 must've hit
He picked me up for another, Wipe the flames from my lips
He goes,"Are you alright, My nig, My nigga, My man?"
"I am what I am and that's all that I ammmmmmmm."
But it left rings around, There's no light who can sound, Whoa whoa whoa, There goes Mr's Claudine,  She likes me in that pimp riding that ain't for fucking shorties, These bitches constantly choosing, But the bitches constantly using
Cause someone can get this nina, Slipping the bitch I saw in my dreams, And I am a roughneck, Through the veins in my neck you check, I want you!

(Chorus: Carmike)

(Verse 2: Carmike)
I drop off smooth spleens on your portrayal of your defense
I really don't like Christmas, Cause I'm the damn Grinch
And for me, It's easy to break you off something
Something like what, My foot broke off in your damn butt
Get touched, Digging nuts, My rhymes kick like mantras
That gangsta, I'm the realsta and the pimpsta, The deuce
Oh, Not the four oh, I can rap hoe, John Wayne on your ass
But you're dealing with the mack, Jack, So roll up another indo sack, But another pint of Yak, So welcome to the underground in the cells where I dwell, Better be down with this motherfucking pimp sound, Lame bitch, I'm versatile
What? You don't believe me, Watch as I rock this crowd
When I come with this wicked shit in town (It's the...) It's Carmike Carmike, Damn that nigga never quits
But I came trick, Cause I ain't lame bitch!

(Chorus: Carmike)
