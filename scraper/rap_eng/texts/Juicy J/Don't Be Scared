[Hook (8x)]
Don't be scared, put the rubber on the head

[Verse 1]
Jo Blow was a little freak that I used to know
My nigga just met her, right in front of a China store
Took her around the corner to his crib, aww yeah
Thirty minutes later, he's dicking the bitch
I wonder if my roadie used the jimmy
'Cause the nigga she fucked, many was plenty
When I had ask him, he had said they did not
Now he's in the Med with the bad case of drip drop

Don't be scared, put the rubber on the head

[Verse 2]
Don't be scared, Evergreen, Magnolia County
Don't be scared, Smokey City, Klondike
Don't be scared, Watkins and Brown, Midtown
Don't be scared, Clayton Homes and Dixie Homes
Don't be scared, Hurts Village, New Chicago
Don't be scared, Hyde Park, Springdale
Don't be scared, cats stay at Orange Mound
Don't be scared, Tulane, Westwood
Bitches are ashamed these days
You'd have to play the bitch before you get yourself played
I never in my life had ever fucked a rat goat
Even wore a jimmy hat when she gave me deep throat
You will choke on my ding-a-ling when it's in your mouth
Bitch, cheat on me and I'll beat your fucking brains out
'Cause if I don't, you'll have me scared
To fuck you with straight dick or rubber on the head

[Hook (8x)]
Don't be scared, put the rubber on the head
