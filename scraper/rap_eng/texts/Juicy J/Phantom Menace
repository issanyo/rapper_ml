[Verse 1: ODDY NUFF DA $NOW LEOPARD]
Back against the wall (fuck!)
With my back against the wall
Still hanging in the hall, never change, I'm the same (nope)
Please don't fucking call me, no (no!)
The person you're tryna reach is unavailable, ayy (aye!)
Remember the days? When me and $lick had to drive to LA?
Sleepin' on the floor at Krez and Fat Nick's house
A hoodie doubles as a pillow
And you're blessed to get a couch (yah, yah, ayy)
Ask for no amount, 'till it's time to really count
Whatever the fuck you say you hate is what the fuck I'm really 'bout
Really doin' drugs, unlike you, do it for the clout (nah)
Really got a problem, like I'm usually blacking out (yuh)
All my friends are headcases, and this kid's gonna pout
Bring me back to the pizza kitchen, I'll clock in and out
Washin' dishes, customers bitching, the manager trippin'
Still, I'm out (out)
Fuck the rap industry, I'm down for the motherfucking count
All you fuckin' clowns, I could really do without (ayy)
I'll be back, I really, really, really doubt

[Verse 2: LIL CUT THROAT]
Southside maniac with the nine loaded (what?)
Northside Shawty, AKA I'm loaded (okay)
Made a couple milli', world touring
Fucking it up—but fuck a couple milli'
Burn it up, like I'm the Joker in Gotham City
Before them days, we used to hit up Orange Mound (hold up)
TA, Ghost, Smurf, brought the skunk out (throw them hands, like—)
Ridin' four deep
Smoked out, loced out
Smoked out, loced out (what—?)
Now I'm surrounded by folks I never met
Seems like the bigger you get, equals nothing but death
But nonetheless, still got them dead presidents
Innocent residents, stray bullets, deaths begin
Funerals for the cold-blooded, makeup skin (pop-pop-pop)
So I call Ruby, he said he got the blade (okay)
I'm like, "Okay, I got the jacket loaded, and the AK"
And the AK, AK...

[Outro: ODDY NUFF DA $NOW LEOPARD & LIL CUT THROAT]
Fuck you!
All of y'all are fake, all of y'all are fake, all of y'all are fake
When I die, bury me in all grey
All of y'all are fake, all of y'all are fake, all of y'all are fake
$uicide, 'till the motherfucking grave
All of y'all are fake, all of y'all are fake, all of y'all are fake
When I die, bury me in all grey
All of y'all are fake, all of y'all are fake, all of y'all are fake
It's $uicide, 'till the motherfucking grave
