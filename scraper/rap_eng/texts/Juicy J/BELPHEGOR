I watch, i watch, i watch, i watch
I watch the bubble from the blood surface from his brain
I watch the bubble from the blood surface from his brain
I watch the bubble from the blood surface from his brain

[Verse 1]
The motherfuckin south is in the house foe the nine-fo
Memphis niggas, nigga and we killas who gon run the floor
One of you hoes step
One of you hoes gonna die bitch
Ain't no thang
Simple and plain bang
In your eye bitch
Tricky type ass niggas
Always wanna flex they nuts
But they gonna get fucked
With this nine
Stuck up they butt
Unload this whole damn clip up in your ass ho
Naw, its to late to squash the shit
I'm gonna blast ho
Fuck the five O
And the motherfuckin jumpin grass
Searching a real nigga in his draws
Like they ass a fag
Get yo god damn hands off of a real one
Just before I make you feel the bullets from my steel, some
Big ass cop think I'm playin
But I'm from tha hood
North Memphis ho
Yeah rank it bitch Hollywood (yeah)
Ready and prepared
That's the execution with my tone
Whatcha gonna do when my nine chrome's at your dome

[Verse 1]
Bi-bi-bi-bibitch you know this score is murder
When I'm crossing through your fucking hood
Bullies with them pulleys, making em'
The set is still up to no good
Bring the pump
Leaving the body inside of the trunk
Your body get slumped
Mangle the body and leave it in chunks
Slow to the flow, roll up the skunk
Comin' out the Westside, jumping out the whip
With a full clip then I let it bust
With a deadly touch
Get em buck as fuck
Don't get stuck by the devil's son
Cursed and burned by the flames
This ain't an arrange
I'm bringing the pain
Looked in the brain
I don't give a fuck
Hanging myself then cutting the vein
It's a stick-up
My chopper do the hiccup
Pull up with the cuete five pints in the pick-up
Long Haired Dragon with
The Silver Back Gorilla
Keystone the Prince
Down south of North Califa
Ain't shit changed walking round
With my teaser
Homies keep they thang cholo tryna get they visa
Swiper no swiping
Mastercard or them Visas
Time to get slammed
Fuckboy it's the season
