[Hook: Juicy J]
Yo mami an yo pops man they 'bout to find yo body
The snitcher and the cops man they 'bout to find yo body
The ambulance and morgue man they 'bout to find yo body
Laid out on the floor man they 'bout to find yo body

[Crunchy Black]
One, two, here I come foo
Three, four, kickin' in the door
Five, six, rob a nigga quick
Seven, eight, get away straight

[Lord Infamous]
Throats cut, gun shot wounds, broke bones
Plagues, diseases, war clones and ozones
Playa depleting, global heating, west nile
Everynight on the news another murder trial

[Juicy J]
He grew up as a robbin' motha fucka, he didn't give a shit
Give my black ski mask and gun and a do' to kick
Down watchin' frown put the tone underneath your chin
You know Project Pat is there your nigga down to make some fizz

[DJ Paul]
From the uterus to the funerals
I'ma keep my crown
Bitch I ain't from England
But my money still come in pounds
Lost a couple of members for the better
Still we hold it down, meet up on the
Bees on the ground from a .40 round put 'em down
