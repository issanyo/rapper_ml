[Hook x2]
Nigga, I ain't scrapping, I'm strapped with the strap
Fuck around and I'mma turn your trap into a death trap
Put some money on your head like a cap
Kill your ass on the track, and we gon' call that a wrap

[Verse 1]
Them jacker's want my watch; them jacker's want my rings
My ice for your life, damn right we can't exchange
I'm crazy like a motherfucker, Saddam'a Hussein
I'm running over pussy niggas, stay out of my lane!
Got a AK47 pointed at your brain
There's a tombstone somewhere waiting for your name
Most my family gang members, but you won't even know it
Until they catch you out in public with the choppers showing!

[Hook x2]
Nigga, I ain't scrapping, I'm strapped with the strap
Fuck around and I'mma turn your trap into a death trap
Put some money on your head like a cap
Kill your ass on the track, and we gon' call that a wrap

[Verse 2]
Leggo!
Sitting in my manesion; making phone calls
On niggas that done crossed me; kill 'em all!
For twenty bands they do anything
Fifty bands up the murder rate
Unsolved mysteries, they couldn't solve this
Four dead bodies in the forest
Niggas shoulda ran like Forrest
Niggas shoulda finished what they started

[Hook x2]
Nigga, I ain't scrapping, I'm strapped with the strap
Fuck around and I'mma turn your trap into a death trap
Put some money on your head like a cap
Kill your ass on the track, and we gon' call that a wrap
