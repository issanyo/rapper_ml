(Chorus) x2
No I'm not that nigga that be hugged up with you, but
I'm tha one walkin away
With your mouth on my nuts

(Juicy J)
Let's take a trip to east high
And talk about a bitch
Who claims she's a model
But I think her hobbie's suckin dick
Always talkin bout what she can and gonna do
But I prefer the freaky bitch to lay me down and chew
If a nigga see you in a hallway they all say
Put the ho on the house out the way
Juicy J is the type a nigga that your hoes don't wanna dis
White Haven target bitch
Take a sip of my piss
And to that other stupid bitch that go to Ferly
With the natural curly
Who wasn't givin a nigga nothin burly
Come to my crib and maybe yet you can come to the hideout
And let a nigga fuck ya inside
(I gotta) Come in my shorts
Dog with gold fangs hittin' the strip
Searching for a girl who works at Captain D's
Talkin shit who said I did nothin for her mayn
You's a fuckin slut
I'm not that nigga that be wit cha all hugged up
Bitch

(Chorus)

(Juicy J)
Freaky freak material hoes
Think they called gold diggers
Always on a niggas nuts
Always try to juice a nigga
(Buy me this, Buy me that)
Bitch I can't buy you jack
But I got fees
For a room and some jimmy hats
If you wanna play around and tease
I don't want the cat
Dropped her off
Called up another fuckin hood rat
This is the girl my nigga said had a deadly bite
Likes to get drunk as a skunk and comes out at night
Creepin through Cherokee
Real slow low key
Standin in the driveway
Now its time for a nigga like me
To get the bitch to do me up
Chew me up
Real sweet
Slob on the knob
If you niggas know the master piece
Once again
On the hoe stroll
Tryin to lay pole
To a stupid dike lookin bitch
23 years old
Working at Sam's Town Casino
Maybe Lady Luck
But I'm not that nigga that be with you all huged up

(Chorus) Till Fade
