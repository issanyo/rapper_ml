My hoes they do drugs
My hoes they do drugs
Can't trust shawty
Can't trust shawty
Cause my hoes they do drugs

[Verse 1: King L]
Who am I? I'm King Louie from the Chi
Molly, ecstasy and Mary, yeah my bitches they stay high
I don't know if they write stories, but my bitches stay bi
Give me head till I'm sleeping, compliment me when I'm fly
(Is you high?) Yeah I'm high, smoking heavy till I die
With a bad bitch beside, she addicted to my life
She ain't my wife, she just one night
I just fuck her, let you love her
Smash and pass her to my brother
There will never be another
F-F-F-Fucking up these streets, getting fucked up me and two freaks
Told them birds to give me beak and the drugs; they do not cheep
Bitches playing with their nose, got them taking off their clothes
Got a thick lil' bitch from Houston, all she do is pour up fo's
Bump that lil' bitch on the low, she was rocking off her deuce
She said she want some Fiji water, or maybe some orange juice
I supply my girls with drugs, Pile em in this H2
I thought I was fucking one, but baby she brought two, three?

[Hook]
Bad, bad little bitch

On the West Side of L.A
Fuckin' niggas all night
Poppin' pills everyday

Pop a bean, pourin' lean

She trippy off that money, she dancin' like she be fuckin'
She looking like she be want it, she see the way a nigga be stuntin'
She movin' fast for them 20s, she choosin' up for them 50s
All my niggas throwing bills, I'm tryna see more than titties
I don't know her name but I want her brain
Bitch so bad should've seen her whole frame
I just spun out in a new Range, in her mouth, I just came
Got them bitches pussies poppin' pills, we gone pop some more
These hoes on that molly and I'mma fuck them both
Pop that pussy open, pop that pussy open
Pour champagne on that ho, I'mma leave that bitch soaking

Skinny tires, angel wings on that hood

Got them bitches on that juice
Poppin' mollies and they loose
I put that on my Jesus (WOO!)
Black gold and it's flooded
G.O.O.D. Music King Tutted
My jeweler told yo jeweler that them niggas don't cut it!
Them niggas be hating, them hoes they be waiting
We turnt up like bright light, shit, every night is like Vegas
Eyes low, leaning back, sippin' on that Desiac
Introduce you to the lifestyle, it's long paper where we be at
