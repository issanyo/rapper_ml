[Intro]
A wise man once said
Money talks real loud, bullshit whispers
High as fuck right now
So if you ain't talking 'bout money stop talking nigga

[Hook: Juicy J]
I got money and I'm still getting money
You broke ass niggas ain't getting money
Some of you niggas just getting money
I keep money, bitch I been getting money
I got money and I'm still getting money
You broke ass niggas ain't getting money
Some of you niggas just getting money
I keep money, bitch I been getting money

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
A million dollar nigga, Juicy got them millions nigga
I always hear the haters but I don't see them niggas
I'm trynna hit a chick, friend, twin, and a ten
When it comes to bitches, Juicy Wilt Chamberlain
I'm getting money balling but never play a sport
I'm so hot, in the winter I can wear shorts
Yeah this Gucci duffle bag got a lot of G's
And got something for you rats, chasing for my cheese
I'm trippy mane, mane where that trippy stick?
Shorty won't get that time unless she a trippy chick
Thumbs catching cramps counting so much damn cash
I'm counting the money slow, but it's coming fast

[Hook: Juicy J]
I got money and I'm still getting money
You broke ass niggas ain't getting money
Some of you niggas just getting money
I keep money, bitch I been getting money
I got money and I'm still getting money
You broke ass niggas ain't getting money
Some of you niggas just getting money
I keep money, bitch I been getting money

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Cash on top of that cash
Riding 'round with that mask
AK-47 and a motherfucking trash bag
I'm 'bout to go to work, one rule, cash first
All I keep is hundreds and the ones go to church
I'm In these streets, I'm bout to go verse
Only time I'm off is when I'm blowing purp
If you ain't bout your earnings then you playing bert
I got eighty-million reasons why my plan works
And it was so worth it
Cause I got bad bitches walking 'round me tan perfect
I get dollars by the pound can't you see it mane?
All that hating that you do a Louis lens can't see it mane

[Hook: Juicy J]
I got money and I'm still getting money
You broke ass niggas ain't getting money
Some of you niggas just getting money
I keep money, bitch I been getting money
I got money and I'm still getting money
You broke ass niggas ain't getting money
Some of you niggas just getting money
I keep money, bitch I been getting money
