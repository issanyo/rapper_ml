What's going down?
Yeah! (Yeah)

(Verse 1:)
I ain't the one to cuss but fuck ya
Way before you went and copped that truck (I still loved you)
When your ass got laid off boy (I was there for ya)
I should've listened to my ladies, when they told me
"Girl, he ain't nothing but a:."
You ain't nothing but, a busta
Still I find it so hard to believe (That I touched ya)
I should've spent more time doing me (But I loved ya)
Tell me was it worth sleepin' round with them girls
What you supposed to be? Exactly! You's a b (Biatch)
You're actin', portrayin' to be somethin' you wanted to be ya whole life, but please
Be easy, cause it's plain to see
That them Eva's and them Vida's that can't add up to me boy

(Bridge:)
So, let me set the scene boy
Pan right, take a look at me boy
Damn right, hope you like what you see boy
Don't let the door hit you on yo ass when you leave boy

(Hook:)
Tell me...
Who's gonna ri-i-i-ide?
Who's gonna ri-i-i-ide?
Who's gonna ri-i-i-ide?
Now that i'm gone
Tell me who's gonna ri-i-i-ide?
Who's gonna ri-i-i-ide?
Who's gonna ri-i-i-ide?
Now that i'm gone

(Verse 2:)
All you Triflin', skeezas, you know who you are
On the road to riches couple them superstars
Every hotel you visit, come out lookin' scarred
Look theres goes another hoe, seen her in a video
Pages in a magazine, she swear she look as bad as me (No, no)
And til this day still can't believe (No, no)
But I guess that's where you wanna be, go ahead that's alright with me

(Bridge:)
So, let me set the scene boy
Pan right, take a look at me boy
Damn right, hope you like what you see boy
Don't let the door hit you on yo ass when you leave boy

(Hook:)
Tell me...
Who's gonna ri-i-i-ide?
Who's gonna ri-i-i-ide?
Who's gonna ri-i-i-ide?
Now that i'm gone
Tell me who's gonna ri-i-i-ide?
Who's gonna ri-i-i-ide?
Who's gonna ri-i-i-ide?
Now that i'm gone

(Juicy J:)
Juciy J i'm tryna sweat these women
I'm layin' down this pimpin'
If you don't want her playa give her up I'm takin'
I ain't with no fakin', these games I don't be playin'
I got 12 inches long as ding dong, I'm layin'

(DJ Paul:)
DJ Paul, this the truth, 110 approval
I ride for you girl just be there to pour my Ramen Noodles
That's all I ask Christina, I never been that greedy
I come from the slums of the M, it don't take much to please me

(Hook:)

Who's gonna ri-i-i-ide?
Who's gonna ri-i-i-ide?
