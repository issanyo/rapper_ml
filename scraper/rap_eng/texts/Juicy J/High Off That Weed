(I'm high off that weed...)

1 - When you're smokin' on some 8
Fool, it ain't no joke
Take a shot of Rene Martin
Then pass the dope
We gon' ball 'til we fall
Get drunk and choke
Breathe up on that green
Meet me back at the store

Repeat 1

[Gangsta Boo]
I'm watchin' this track like a tornado
When I'm full of that green
It gotta be some head banger
Do you know what I mean?
I'm on the scene, feelin' slow
I just smoked and ODed
It's all good, I'm havin' fun
With my niggas and me
The Z3 accompanied by a driver named Boo
I'm high, I smoked a lot
I'm gonna blaze 'til I'm through
Can you hang with us baby?
We get high off several, things that make you say
"Damn, I'm scared to get on their level"
We be clubbin', always knock the heavy spots when we late
We heavy drinkin' on some Mo'
We party-hardy all day
So what you say, you in on it?
Then pass it around
Lights, camera, action
Candid Camera now
Just a joke to provoke you to get high
To each, it's on, a partier 'til I die
Nineteen ninety fuckin' nine
Oops, the party is over
Overflow, battin' at 2 ? black Range Rovers, yeah

(I'm high off that weed...)

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[Gangsta Boo]
I'm hittin' the park, eyes fucked
Just-a keepin' it real
So if you feel the way I feel
Then ya ass know the deal
I get some chronic, killa fragrance
So my ride'll smell good
All you niggas in the hood know that shit do some good
Good enough to knock the odor out some weed that's on fire
? taped around my waste
I fly the friendly skies
To get 'bout it 'round my venus
Cuz I got shit to do
So do enough to get me through
The world ? Gangsta Boo
I got the mask to my fuckin' face
I'm fiendin'' to increase my high
??? red as hell, these bitches better recognize
Gangsta Boo, the scandalous bitch that do not take no shit
Smoked-a, loc'ed-a
Playas all around, but known as Triple 6
Million blunts up in my mind
Yeah my niggas cap at times
Smoked up all the blunts
And now I'm high, I'm on cloud 9
Dumb trick up into my clique
You'll get your fuckin' body bust
Bitches bodies chopped up
Mixed with guts and shit, off in my trunk

(I'm high off that weed...)
