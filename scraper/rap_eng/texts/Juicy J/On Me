[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Thick thigh, pretty face, this bitch raw
What I gotta do for her get her to the car?
In a rush, too excited, dick still soft
Whole clique flippin' cocaine when it's soft
And I ain't even trippin' on a bitch on who she choose to love
Talk all on the ear in while I'm seducin' her
Face car, Oxycontin race car
Need a boss bitch that's in college with a bank card
Player type nigga out the way but like the coach
She get outta line it ain't no need to be provoked
Gravitation won't explain, ain't no need to get her choked, come here!
All I gotta do is say is I'm gone, she gon' run in

[Bridge: Kevin Gates]
Thick thighs, pretty face
This bitch raw, need a boss bitch, bitch
Thick, thick thighs, pretty face
This bitch raw, need a boss bitch, bitch
Thick, thick thighs, pretty face
This bitch raw, need a boss bitch, bitch
Thick, thick thighs, pretty face
This bitch raw, need a boss bitch, bitch
Thick, thick thighs, pretty face

[Hook: Problem]
I'ma ride for the V, I'm sly for the V
I'ma keep right for the V
Can you put it on me?
Put that pussy on me, right now, now (oh)
Right now, now
Put that pussy on me, right now, now (ohhh)
Right now, now

[Verse 2: K Check]
Hey girl with the big booty, let's get a hotel we can get stupid
Nothin' drop a stack, let a bitch choose me
99 problems with the Rick Rubin
But my dick ain't one, swear the shit A1
Young nigga 'bout business and I don't play dumb
But I do play hoes like an Xbox One
Have sex the first night, dip when I'm done
I don't get tired, eat the pussy like I just fried it
Hold my breath when I'm down, breathe through my eye lid
She a freak want to ride me, nut inside me
I'm like baby wait a minute, that's gonna be a problem
I just put the pussy on the pedestal
Make me have a drool, have me breakin' every rule
You the type of bitch that make my toes curl
Let's double up, send a message to your home girl

[Hook: Problem]
I'ma ride for the V, I'm sly for the V
I'ma keep right for the V
Can you put it on me?
Put that pussy on me, right now, now (oh)
Right now, now
Put that pussy on me, right now, now (ohhh)
Right now, now

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Put it on me like Cologne
I'ma buy a chick a bag
For that ass that's alone
Get up in it and then I'm gone
Eyes weak, I've been blowing strong
Whip full of girls gettin' lit like a check engine
Baby not to mention, that I'm smokin' presidential like Nixon
Tryin' to get cut like Nicole Simpson
Pussy drippin' wet like I just rinsed it
She ain't talking 'bout no top then the bitch senseless
Hard out here and we still pimpin'
Walking in the room , now lil mama limpin'
Juicy J the one and only, you niggas phony
Pussy tighter than some handcuffs, put it on me

[Hook: Problem & Juicy J]
I'ma ride for the V, I'm sly for the V
Put it on me
I'ma keep right for the V
Can you put it on me?
Pussy tighter than some handcuffs, put it on me
Put that pussy on me, right now, now (oh)
Right now, now
Put it on me right now, now (ohhh)
Right now, now
Pussy tighter than some handcuffs, put it on me
