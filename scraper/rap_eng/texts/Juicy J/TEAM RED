(Chorus)
I'm on team red
You on team blue
I'd shoot yo whole team including you
Fuck you nigga there isn't nobody to sue (repeat)

(Verse 1)
If we on opposite teams then we shouldn't be friends
AK-47 is yo best man
Don't have time to go to your wedding
No wife, just a funeral for yo body
Yo team is like halo and Call Of Duty
We black-ops
While ya'll niggas out here getting booty
Don't talk that talk unless you getting moody
Until then just walk that walk until you loose bluet
White girls dress-in' like mayonnaise
Trippy thicke with her ass out
Shortie put a wax on wax
To make sure her pussy maxed out
I don't want to relax or chill out
Because I'm not going to make this bread
On the black out

(Chorus)
I'm on team red
You on team blue
I'd shoot yo whole team including you
Fuck you nigga there isn't nobody to sue (repeat)

(Verse 2)
What you mean we done
What you mean you front
What you mean you fuck a bitch and go all straight dumb
I don't need a thumb
Straight dissing out your mum
I remember I was making yo face looking like a bumb
You ain't jealous yet
Niko rellish yet
I was in the car with the Draco
Pointin' dead right at your chest
Freestyling is my best
I go on Sunday rest
I never ever stop because I need my vest
I'm an undercover blood in discuised
As a fucking zip
Most people say I don't lie I just need a tip
Maybe it's the next one because I am tired of this

(Chorus)
I'm on team red
You on team blue
I'd shoot yo whole team including you
Fuck you nigga there isn't nobody to sue (repeat)
