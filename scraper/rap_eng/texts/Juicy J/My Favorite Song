[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Gone, gone, gone
I'm ballin too my nigga

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
When this song come on, I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to
When this song come on, I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Highly faded, but I'm highly paid so I just live my life
That shit you niggas tryna do, I guarantee I did it twice
They say life's a gamble, hit my joint and roll the dice
When you living this high, you can't be afraid of heights
Book my flight to Vegas, Will, 20 thou- to stay the night
Another 10 on champagne, my money long, I pay the price
Tired of niggas saying they in my gang cause dog, we ain't alike
I'm throwing money, when I walk up in this bitch, they know it's money
Money in my arms, other table full of money
Pocket full of joints I rolled, dropping ashes on my clothes
Balling super hard, smoking 'til I overdose
Hardly ever sober, bitch we party 'til it's over

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
When this song come on, I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to
When this song come on, I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Niggas always hating on me, talking 'bout I'm balling too
Get your money up and quit your hating's what you oughta do
I been going hard since I was young when I was in my teens
I knew when I got older I'd be on, so now I do my thing
Spending money, popping hella bottles, making niggas mad
Going places, rolling Js, I live the life you wish you had
Throwing out dollars bills, putting shit on my tab
Got a joint full of that OG, got a clique full of them OGs

[Verse 3: Juicy J (and Wiz Khalifa)]
Trippy nigga hit the club, you know I be fucked up
Chasing after model chicks, tryna get my fucks up
Niggas handcuffing hoes, but them niggas know what's up
Y'all came to the club together, but that ho gon' leave with us
Break out the blue dream, e'rybody rolling up
Where the lean? Where the cups? Ho, it's time to po' it up
Tell the owner we ain't leavin', we gon' buy the whole club
(Now my dollars to the ceiling, and my card ain't got no limit)

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
When this song come on, I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to
When this song come on, I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to

[Interview: Wiz Khalifa]
We be in the clubs with all those motherfuckers
And we spend more money than all of them niggas
Them niggas who be thinkin' they hard
And they think they're motherfuckin' this and that
Yeah, 30 racks bitch. On champagne motherfucker
Keep them sparklers coming, what you doin?
And them niggas be over there and they be quiet
That's why Juicy's with us nigga
Cause we spend 30 racks in the club
