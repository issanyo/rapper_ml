She see the racks, you know I got that pack
She see the racks, you know I got that sack
And she know I keep the strong on me

[Verse 2]
Let that kush get my mind right, I been blowin' dope all night
Countin' all these hundreds, nigga I been countin' since all night
Just stuffed me two more cones, broke down two more zones
Pretty bitch, I wanna take her home and fuck her to my favorite song
Got foreign bitches smoking Cali weed
Up in Barneys probably where I be
I just copped me two fifths that probably cost me ten a piece
Cashed out on somethin' new
Blew some on somethin' blue
I just flew out to Miami just to fuck a bitch at the fountain blue
And I'm still workin', and she still twerkin'
Beat it up last night, that pussy is still hurtin'
And i'm still reeking, yeah I'm still tweaking
Nigga ran up on me, and he's still leaking

[Hook]
I got kush and money on me, kush and money on me
You smell that kush and money on me? that kush and money on me?
I got kush and money on me, kush and money on me
You smell that kush and money on me? that kush and money on me?
I got kush and money on me, kush and money on me
You smell that kush and money on me? that kush and money on me?
I got kush and money on me, kush and money on me
You smell that kush and money on me? that kush and money on me?
