[Verse 1: blackbear]
Yeah, yeah
Juicy sweatsuits
Doing lines in the restroom
All your drugs to impress who?
Twenty-something trust issues, girl
Insecure about who you are
You're selfish and you know it
I'm here tonight and I'm gone tomorrow
Move too fast and you took it too far

[Verse 2: blackbear]
I wanna go
Wherever you ain't gon' be
Don't make me post
Them pics you ain't want no one to see
Yeah, hell yeah
Tell me why my exes besties now
Acting like it stress me out
Mad that I won't text them now
Y'all just look depressin' now

[Pre-Chorus: blackbear]
I was down for you
At one point in my life
Down for you
Once upon a time
You held me down
Now you just holding me back

[Chorus: blackbear]
Tell me why my exes besties now
Thinking pics gon' stress me out
Mad that I won't sex 'em now
Y'all just look depressin' in those sweatsuits
Doing lines in the restroom
All y'all dressed like, "Who dressed you?"
Forever 21, God bless you
Girl, we use to pop them bottles of that champagne
Now you in the closet of the club doing cheap cocaine
Thank God that's over

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Hey, hey
I know you wanna run back to me but it's too late (too late)
Ain't no room left for you in the Wraith (mm-mm)
You had to go left so I got you replaced (placed)
Nah, met your best friend, guess she got good taste (good taste)
She wanna find out what Juicy J taste like (taste like)
Eyes red like the Rolls-Royce brake lights (brake lights)
I got my shades on even in the late night (late night)
'Cause if I lift my wrist I might blind myself
I got a hand full of ice but this kind don't melt
You think you can do better, you just lyin' to yourself
Can't name one nigga that can never keep up
My last chick wasn't dope enough, I had to re-up

[Pre-Chorus: blackbear]
I was down for you
At one point in my life
Down for you
Once upon a time
You held me down
Now you just holding me back

[Chorus: blackbear]
Tell me why my exes besties now
Thinking pics gon' stress me out
Mad that I won't sex 'em now
Y'all just look depressin' in those sweatsuits
Doing lines in the restroom
All y'all dressed like, "Who dressed you?"
Forever 21, God bless you
Girl, we use to pop them bottles of that champagne
Now you in the closet of the club doing cheap cocaine
Thank God that's over
