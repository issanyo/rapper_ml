[Hook]
I'm from the dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty
I keep a Styrofoam of muddy, muddy, muddy, muddy
A couple foreign hoes that's slutty, slutty, slutty, slutty
I call my jeweler, told 'em flood it, flood it, flood it, flood it, flood it
I'm from the dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty
I keep a Styrofoam of muddy, muddy, muddy, muddy
A couple foreign hoes that's slutty, slutty, slutty, slutty
I call my jeweler, told 'em flood it, flood it, flood it, flood it, flood it

[Verse 1]
I'm from the dirty, I came up from nothing
I'm from when niggas hop out and pop your ass for nothing
250 on the dash, I do that shit for nothing
I put 100 on your head, I bet your niggas touch 'em
50 on these yellow diamonds, got my fingers buzzin'
50 up in king of diamonds, got these bitches bussin'
All these bitches say they love me, I can't never trust 'em
You know I can't go nowhere without the fucking Russian
I ain't with no back and forth, I see that nigga, rush 'em
Hit that nigga andalay
Do that shit a smarter way, pop up where your momma stay
If they want a war then tell 'em pussy niggas bombs away
I come from when you talk that shit, nigga you gon' be gone today

[Hook]
I'm from the dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty
I keep a Styrofoam of muddy, muddy, muddy, muddy
A couple foreign hoes that's slutty, slutty, slutty, slutty
I call my jeweler, told 'em flood it, flood it, flood it, flood it, flood it
I'm from the dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty
I keep a Styrofoam of muddy, muddy, muddy, muddy
A couple foreign hoes that's slutty, slutty, slutty, slutty
I call my jeweler, told 'em flood it, flood it, flood it, flood it, flood it

[Verse 2]
I got some shooters on the squad
I got some killers on the team
I drop a hitter in my bottle, you don't wanna hit my lean
Nigga everything exotic, no doubt bitches on the scene
Dropped the car note on these glasses and a portion on these jeans
Got your bitch so hot, she swear for god she just seen Jesus
She give me nothing but head nigga just call me Beavis
I call me jeweller, they get my chain up out the freezer
I got some niggas that'll come and blow you to pieces
Nigga I'm itching to do it, just give me a reason
Nigga I been got my stripes in the hood like Adidas
I do this for all the struggling under achievers
Made it to the top now the non believers believe us

[Hook]
I'm from the dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty
I keep a Styrofoam of muddy, muddy, muddy, muddy
A couple foreign hoes that's slutty, slutty, slutty, slutty
I call my jeweler, told 'em flood it, flood it, flood it, flood it, flood it
I'm from the dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty
I keep a Styrofoam of muddy, muddy, muddy, muddy
A couple foreign hoes that's slutty, slutty, slutty, slutty
I call my jeweler, told 'em flood it, flood it, flood it, flood it, flood it
