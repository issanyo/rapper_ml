[Verse 1: Yamine]
I’m running and hiding
I have no time for violence (Yeah)

And the bands

And never go coughin (nope)
I’m in debt
But don’t take loses
I don’t care cuz my j’s in a coffin (Yeah)

Once people go shopping
We all end up broke
And n***** still jocking
You got the new J’s
But you keep mopping (oh)

And nothing is left (Yeah)

So let’s go back on this hook before I’m in debt (debt)

(Bridge: Yamine)
N***** know what happens when you bleed  (when you bleed)
