[Intro]
I said I was gone quit, but I just relapsed
I said I was gone quit, but I just relapsed
I said I was gone quit, but I just relapsed
I said I was gone quit, but I just relapsed

[Chorus]
Ever since I put the game in the choke hold
Niggas informants, they runnin' their mouths
'Cause they runnin', they talk to the po-po
I'm unapproachable, they get emotional that's why I keep me a .44
Next time I need me a boatload, I'm never a no-show
When it comes to this money, you niggas is so slow
Jealousy lives till you sellin' me out, now agents is takin' my photos
I'm back on the map and solo, you backstabbin' niggas a no-go
I know some niggas that mo' hoe then some of these bitches
I know some hoes with no souls, them bitches is killas

[Verse 1]
I come from the block, I been on the road, I'm constantly sellin' out shows
Anything goes, when you on the street, nobody don't speak to the code, I know
Niggas gon' talk, just like they hoes, that pressure be makin' them fold
My money longer, my nigga stronger, I'm really doin' the most fo' so
If niggas ain't solid, then niggas ain't valid, I really don't care nothin' about 'em
My diamonds is wet like a fountain, they rocky, I'm climbin' the charts like a mountain
This paper I'm countin', comin' in constantly proud of, niggas quit bitchin' about it
Niggas be hoes, all in they feelings about it, ain't never gon' do shit about it

[Chorus]
Ever since I put the game in the choke hold
Niggas informants, they runnin' their mouths
'Cause they runnin', they talk to the po-po
I'm unapproachable, they get emotional, that's why I keep me a .44
Next time I need me a boatload, I'm never a no-show
When it comes to this money, you niggas is so slow
Jealousy lives till you sellin' me out, now agents is takin' my photos
I'm back on the map and solo, you backstabbin' niggas a no-go
I know some niggas that mo' hoe then some of these bitches
I know some hoes with no souls, them bitches is killas

[Verse 2]
Nigga I'm certified, when I drop records I murder guys
My flow impeccable, I treat the beat like a edible, I got more bars then the federal
Penitentiary, I'm so dope they wanna sentence me
I know they envy me, ridin' in the back of the Tesla, smokin' on gas in this bitch but it run off of energy
I got the game in a choke hold, I got that shit for the lo-lo
Playin' I'm bangin' that .44, we never fuck with the po-po
In my hood that's just a no-no, hold on
Money keep callin' my phone
Man I'm so booked, I'll fuck around, need me a clone
Nigga we on, pull up and fuck shit up, pick up a bag and nigga we go fuck the
Industry, nigga I'm in the street nigga, this shit is sweet nigga, I'm twenty deep nigga
I ain't talkin' 'bout niggas I'm talkin' bout M's, drop the top let her hair blow in the wind
I sin, pray to God, do it again, nigga I'm only human
My bitch a ten times ten so I'ma need you and all of your friends, bitch

[Chorus]
Ever since I put the game in the choke hold
Niggas informants, they runnin' their mouths
'Cause they runnin', they talk to the po-po
I'm unapproachable, they get emotional, that's why I keep me a .44
Next time I need me a boatload, I'm never a no-show
When it comes to this money, you niggas is so-so
Jealousy lives till you sellin' me out, now agents is takin' my photos
I'm back on the map and solo, you backstabbin' niggas a no-go
I know some niggas that mo' hoe then some of these bitches
I know some hoes with no souls, them bitches is killas'
