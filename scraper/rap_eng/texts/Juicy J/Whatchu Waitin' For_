After a few shots, she can go all night
I hit the right spot, she's all mine
There's only one way you can know for sure
What are you waiting for?
Whatchu waiting for?

Why don't we go back and escape the world?
I see those eyes and I know you wanna leave this place so bad
Yeah, I feel it
You feel it

So whatchu waiting for?
Baby, I'm the one who could show you what it's like if you try to come
Take you to a place you've never been before
What are you waiting for?
Whatchu waiting for?

Put your drink in the air
Shake them tits like you don't care
Lots of booty you should share
Nigga like me get tired of starin'

Play it like me, I been tryin' to get it
Stripclub in a club, when I made my sittin'
Though I'm not a lotta cash, they don't never quittin'
Threesome, foursome, I'ma gonna get it

What it is, little mamma, whatchu pullin' stops now?
Yeah, let me crank it up, gonna pull the drops out
Get your picture taken by the paparazzi
Drop it in the pants, you can sing to my Mazarati

Leavin' the party, pull a Bacardi
Tryin' to get to places and light it light
Quit cheatin' yourself, you know you want the night
You know you want the light, you want me in your life
You want me in your bed, you want me in your head
Pullin' your leg...

So whatchu waiting for?
Baby, I'm the one who could show you what it's like if you try to come
Take you to a place you've never been before
What are you waiting for?
Whatchu waiting for?

Yeah, I feel it

So whatchu waiting for?
Baby, I'm the one who could show you what it's like if you try to come
