See I learned I can't change bitches
I can only change how I deal wit' 'em (Woo)

Can't speak my mind and keep it real wit' 'em (Yeah)
And I can't talk that big shit with a little nigga
That's some shit you wouldn't understand
I watch nigga's fuck up my whole operation (Why?)
'Cause they want to be the ones who make the plans (Little bitch)
If you're jealous of me why we friends? (Why?)
Why you cappin' like you was my mans?
Why you frontin' like your happy for me?
But you can't wait 'til it ends (Can't wait)

[Verse 3: Killumantii]
Are all the hatin' niggas in the world
I think you hate me the most (Yeah)
I heard you blocked me from your nigga's page
So he can't see nothin' I post (Uh huh)
Funny how the most love I get
Come from niggas I ain't never met
'Cause the niggas that see my in real life
Be the main ones upset
But we got the same 24 hours baby
I just use mine a little smarter
And we all take home the same bag
You's just mad 'cause mine's a little larger
And my whole plan is to shit on niggas
I apologize in advance (In advance)
So you gon' have to come a little stronger baby
'Cause I been a nigga with a plan

[Chorus]

On that hatin' ass shit
He's a (Jealous ass bitch)
She's a (Jealous ass bitch)
You's a (Jealous ass bitch)
