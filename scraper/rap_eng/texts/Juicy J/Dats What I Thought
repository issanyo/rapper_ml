[Intro: Lord Infamous]
I see them fuckin' press, oh no they better lay
It happens everyday don't make me grab the gauge
Dangerously I play, I blast out yo rib cage
And put ya body in the back of that grey Chevrolet

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Niggas be talking that shit
But they ain't really 'bout it when I see 'em
Yeah, dat's what I thought
She told me she ain't coming out the pussy
But fuck me anyway
Yeah, dat's what I thought
Niggas say he gon' run up with the pack
But brought it right back
Yeah, dat's what I thought
Niggas say them diamonds VVS' but they rhinestones
Yeah, dat's what I thought
Dat's what I thought
Dat's what I thought
Dat's what I thought
Dat's what I thought
Dat's what I thought
Dat's what I thought
Dat's what I thought
Dat's what I thought
Nigga playing games with the bread 'til I come at his head
Yeah, dat's what I thought
Niggas saying I look like a lick 'til I pull out them sticks
Yeah, dat's what I thought

{Verse 1: Juicy J]
Say you on static, you got it, you ain't really 'bout it my nigga
And dat's what I thought
You gon' quit talkin' or either be off with your head instead
Yeah, dat's what I thought
I know some niggas been trappin' for half of they life and they rich And they never got caught
I know some bitches is fucking 'bout every rapper in the city
I never go wrong
I know some bitches that's popping they pussy
Run up a check and they bring it right to me
Bitch, I'm a manager
I know how to handle you
I make a vet outta rookie
You tryna get paid or naw
Dat's what I thought
Hit the stage and take it off
Hop in a Uber, I hop in this Bentley
And sip on this henny
Yeah, dat's what I thought

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Niggas be talking that shit
But they ain't really 'bout it when I see 'em

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Bitch, I'm a boss (bitch, I'm a boss!)
I'm drippin' in sauce (just follow the drip!)
I call it like Moss
She looking too hard
Yeah, dat's what I thought
That what you rented? (that lil shit?)
This what I bought (this big boy shit!)
Show me the pink slip, nigga (where it at?)
Yeah, dat's what I thought (that ain't yo shit!)
Nigga be tough (talkin' that shit!)
When they on the net (talkin' that shit!)
When you see 'em in person (cough!)
They be like "I ain't on that"
Dat's what I thought
That bitch is fine, my truck got a line
That's why I can fuck up a check
These niggas lying, they ain't doing fine
Most of these niggas in debt
Start with the cap, you ain't in the trap
Show me the pack
Yeah, dat's what I thought
You niggas fool, this ain't what you do
Show me the tool
Yeah, dat's what I thought
You talking 'bout bricks like you with the shit
I bet you don't even know how much it cost
You niggas lost, knock that shit off
Soak up the sauce, this shit can't be bought

[Outro: Juicy J & Lord Infamous]
Niggas be talking they shit
But they ain't really 'bout it when I see 'em
Yeah, dat's what I thought
I see them fuckin' press, oh no they better lay
It happens everyday don't make me grab the gauge
Dangerously I play, I blast out yo rib cage
And put ya body in the back of that grey Chevrolet
