[Hook: Juicy J]
(I don't wanna do it to 'em)
Play with the money, play with the money, play with the money
Now-now-now I got to get you
(But I got to do it to 'em)
Play with the money, play with the money, play with the money
Now-now-now I got to get you
(I don't wanna do it to 'em)
Play with the money, play with the money, play with the money
Now-now-now I got to get you
(But I got to do it to 'em)
Play with the money, play with the money, play with the money
Now-now-now I got to get you
(I don't wanna do it to 'em)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
That's my nigga, that's my dog
Ran off with my money, now I got to do my dog
That shit broke my heart, we done been through it all
Why a nigga got to play foul, all I want to do is ball
I can't call up my goons, handle this shit myself
And I'm on a whole lot of drugs, I'm just trying to ease this stress
This nigga like my brother, how he gon' cross that line
How a nigga gon' play me, got to be out his mind
Knowing where we come from, can't just let that shit go
Used to be my charge partner, back in the day when we kicked doors
Throwing crosses, now I gotta off him, but damn, that's my nigga
Now I got to do my nigga, why it have to be my nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
You can't be playing with the paper, homie
You gon' have me duct taping your baby mama
Kidnapping kids, cutting fingers off
Don't make me hunt you down, cause I'm a gun you down when I see you, dog
Juicy J ain't no joke, no conversation, just gun smoke
And we don't care what time it is, show's over, drum roll
Ain't nowhere you can hide, fool, hide your ass when I find you
Catch your ass at that Mickey D's, murk your ass in that drive-thru
You know what I'm 'bout, nigga, chopper under my couch pillow
Them young niggas you sending out all got to go down with you
The options now, I got to pop 'em, but damn, that's my nigga
Now I gotta do my nigga, why it got to be my nigga

[Hook]

[Post-Verse: Elle Varner]
Yeah

One way or another, I'm gonna find you
I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you
One way or another, I'm gonna find you
I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you
One way, yes
I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you
One way, hey
Hey, I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you
One way or another
I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you
One way or another, I'm gonna find you
I'm gonna get you, get you, get you
