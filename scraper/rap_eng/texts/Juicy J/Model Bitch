[Intro: Dr King Flow]
Yeah I don't know about you, but I love me a sexy ass bitch
Fat ass, and some good ass pussy

[Hook: Juicy J]
I want skinny model bitch, that can pole dance on my dick
That can make me nut real quick, that's the business man
She ain't got to have no big tits, but that pussy better have that grip
Not a whole lot of miles on it, no that's the business man
(x2)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I know girls that will fuck me and my friends, if you got a little money she'll give in
If you got a little cocaine she'll blow wind
When I take my dick out, rub it on her chin
My nigga had told me the bitch is bi, I said I didn't even know now watch
Two girls in the hot tub with me now, Mr. Threesome, thought you knew I was that guy
Like huge Hef', stacks on deck, private jets higher than that
Weed I'm smokin', x I'm rollin', Vodka drinkin' I was next
Bring a girl, bring your sister, bring your mama I'm going to let
Let them suck me, let them fuck me, let them jack me, that's on that

[Hook: Juicy J]

[Verse 2: Big Luck]
Yeah, a lot of green's nothing like some new pussy, some tight pussy
Some wet pussy, that good pussy, yeah I love that pussy (Love that pussy)
Ain't no rookie how I beat it up (beat it up), After we fuck she's about to eat it up (eat it up)
I mean, [?] fuck her like a slut (like a slut), go grab your friend we about to switch it up (switch it up)
Grab some bottles, about to tip em' up (tip em' up). you've got big titties but I love your butt (love your butt)
