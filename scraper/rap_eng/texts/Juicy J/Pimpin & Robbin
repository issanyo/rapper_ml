[Hook] 4x
Ain't no money comin' quicker than that hoe money
Pimpin' and robbin' and droppin' these suckas like ducks, bitch

[Verse 1: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Pimp them sluts, break them hoes
Ride clean, smoke your dope
Dipped in gold on them Vogues
Ever since that I'm chargin hoes
Bonin, conin, playas only catch this game that I spit
Playa hatin' niggas we smoke
My pretty boy smile don't joke
We scope, my 44 under the crush
Don't you bite the dust
Fuckin with us niggas, Leave your name on your block...up bitch
But I don't get into that gangsta shit
I relax like a pimp and mack
Hit them trizacks jumpin (income means fiends coming)
The skinny nigga in the house, breakin bitches down
When I drive in the Bonneville, smokin on a match
We chokin, talkin, loc'in, talk crazy to my bitch
I'm walkin with a limp, with my cane
Spittin that game, makin' stangs
Give Me Some! "Mane, I'm fucked up playa"
That's why you ridin clean
Frontin' niggas kills me, fakin' like they heavy
If you ain't makin' stangs, sell me all your jewelry
I'm outtie, my shortie is clean with them hammer thangs
My nigga Rickie, dipped in gold, sho' nuff rollin that weed

[Hook] 4x
Ain't no money comin' quicker than that hoe money
Pimpin' and robbin' and droppin' these suckas like ducks, bitch

[Verse 2: 211]
Give me somethin bitch, I'm talkin about dollar signs
Look here ho, I don't wanna fuck, but buck bitty buck??
A shootin gangsta, light that ass up...
Let's play a game called pimpin' and robbin, mobbin'
Pimpin ain't never stoppin
Leanin to the curb, slam goes my car door
Nothin behind my head but a bumpin system
And a few of my hoes
Drop me off some cheese
Hit em with somethin to keep em pretty
Groupie, droopie, drawed ass bitches, don't act siddity
Find you a trick and break him down
And keep him no. 1 chewer
If my ends don't meet, bitch you get your ass beat
Swisher Sweets, spliff, get a whiff of that Indo blast
Rims gleamin' on the pavement, catchin eyes when I pass
Downin' some Hennessy
A friend of me is some money though
Romance with no finance is a nuisance, fuck that honey ho
Droppin bombs, packin tones for playas to killaz and macks
Skull peelaz, rollin, ho pullin...muthafucka, can you buy that?
