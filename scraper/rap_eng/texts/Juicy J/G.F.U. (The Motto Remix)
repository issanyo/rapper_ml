[Wiz Khalifa Verse]
24, from the hood and I made 11 million this year so im throwin up paper
Got a bunch of niggas with me that done made it from the bottom, gettin' money, all throwin' up Taylor
You can roll em out, puff em, I don't save it, I stuff em I don't gotta chase money im good
Ill bake the whole onion and replace it like its nothing ya im talkin straight cookies no oven
And im smokin' in public, rich folks still love it
He talkin', he bluffin', that's my chick, she stuntin'
And my team is the wildest, try and get high enough to see Mr. Wallace
Thumbs green like the mile is, this for my youngins gettin steamed up in college
If you seen all my closets so much style its like my stylist had a stylist
And my crib like a palace Wizzle go hard like a callus

[Wiz Khalifa]
All we smoke is papers, blowin' hella flavors
Smokin till its gone, that's how we do it cause were taylor'd
[Juicy J]
Get high (get high), get fucked up (get fucked up)
Get high (get high), get fucked up (get fucked up)
Get high (get high), get fucked up (get fucked up)
Get high (get high), get fucked up (get fucked up)

[Juicy J Verse]
Cop a pound, come a pound, roll a pound, blow it down
Call a ho, its goin down, Juicy J from stoner town
Originality where Mary Jane control the sound
Blue Dream and Lean for all of those who knew the time
Hash, kef oils in the gas mask we be doin numbers like its math class
Match one, nigga don't you know im match back
Colors on the herb make the bud look abstract
Smoke good, cause I deserve it, sour diesel got me swerving
Im swerving, right up on the curbing
Big bong rips, got my chest hurting
Purp naps, in the Marriott sweet
I wanna taste the weed but the swisher too sweet
So make sure you know its only taylors if we meet
If you get trippy mane you can even choke a bean
Blood came through and just dropped off a load
And I ain't sellin shit everything gettin smoked
Smoke when I get up, smoke myself to sleep
Taylor Gang bitch 10 pounds every week

[Hook]

[Berner Verse]
Bern ima rep for my city, im on two blue pills and got the room smelling pissy
Ask, I tell her don't kiss me don't come up for air, lost your bitch to the game, fuck it life isn't fair
Im too chill, 2 mil re caught with my rap money
Two or three pads bad bitches roll the planes for me
Two strains that my new nickname, cherry pound cookie all you see is a big flame
Stunt, grown man with a coat on, trippy in a room full of girls with no clothes on
But ya I love how i'm living, I just left the night club im in bed with 3 women
Too high, too fly, big belly cause I eat good
Blew 30 grand on drinks, I better sleep good
Bag full of shit you probably seen in my twitpics
Hoodrich the only thing a stripper get is good dick
Ya im so slow motion in an s class floating hard to keep my eyes open
A king pin I keep weed by the elbow
Skin all itchy tonight, im sippin yellow
