You dealing with some thugs
Who like to hit it from the back (back)

Who like cheese up front (front)
Get down on your knees up front

[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
Nigga please

But sex don't come until we come to our knees
Gimme' yo' cheese
Before I get my niggas and weed
Flatten you out

Me and my girls cost too much for you nigga
Extra nigga in the Jag

Hell No!
I'm the bitch wit the chronic that's getting high
Makin' money, looking funny
When I fuck on you guys
Damn right! I'm the bitch of da night
No matter what
Thugged out in some Sean John jeans
A big butt
What you see when I'm walking on by
I see you looking
Whether male or female
You in I see you lookin'

When I'm packin' yo' nigga

You serve me wit' cha' face nigga

Oops I spilled the beans baby

[Verse 2: D.J. Paul]
I seen em' coming out the club
Drop the posse
Walk me down
Barely able to stand up
Barely able to fall down
Hanging in the bathroom
With my dogs
It's all about two balls
Now I need a warm cup
For a dick and two balls
It's Paul
In a Jag
But ain't bout' to brag
I'm trying to grab a little hot something, skattely wag
Some bout it
Some down it
Stray ghetto ass ho!
Some ready for war!
Cause hittin it boy
Will make your ass go!
All motherfucking night don't play
Drop yo' jawphones, it's on, cause this dick on my leg
Y'all niggas want a real dicksucker
Come Down South
Make you say
"Damn, girl you still eat with that mouth"!
Then she turned over, caught dripping like a faucet
I called my dog Too Sway cause this ho about to toss it
I'm fucking wit chu, cause you fucked wit me!
And caught this christian in a bad little somethin to my whole weed
(Whole Weed)!

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
First, my nigga call the freak
Tell her she got dick to eat
Balls and all standing tall
Don't forget the jack "a" me
Tell her five dope we keep
Opt a move as just a sweep
Heard she liked it from da back
In the back from toronsy
Paul said she wants to blow
With bad (bitch) week we cut off her
I don't wanna hit the jump
Grab my 8.0 we'll get her drunk
"My nigg, what chu' waiting on"?
"Hey let me use that other phone"
Fuck that, she got skit to hit
Im'a call that ho while she at home
"Hello"
"What's the bidness bitch?"
"Who is this?"
"Mister Dick"
"I'm bout' to come and scoop you up"!
"For what?"
"For what to fuck, the click
My dog said you got the clams
Silicon wit the ass
Don't even need a bag
To hide your face
To sit you down!
Rumors say you turn em' out
In da car, or on da couch!
Never hear em' yellin' ouch!
Dick and balls up in yo' mouth!
Grab my 8.0, (and in a hit)
Maybe you can bring you friend"
"Do you niggas got that blow"
"YA" !
