[Hook - Billy Wes]
Dollar signs in my eyes, all I see is money
Dollar signs in my eyes, all I see is money
Dollar signs in my eyes, all I see is money
Dollar signs in my eyes, all I see is money
Rubber bands, rubber bands, rubber bands, rubber bands
All I see is money
Rubber bands, rubber bands, rubber bands, rubber bands
All I see is money
Rubber bands, rubber bands, rubber bands, rubber bands
All I see is money
Rubber bands, rubber bands, rubber bands, rubber bands
All I see is money

[Verse 1 - Rick Ross]
Step out the car, rubber bands in my pocket
Rose gold Rolex, look like it's plugged in a socket
All the bad bitches lookin', all the fuck niggas jock it
People investigatin', I let the streets keep on talkin'
Got a brick in the trunk, you know I gotta get mine
Momma always said "it'll come in good time"
So I took what she said, flipped a bitch a few times
Went and got a Suburban and a new Benz to ride
Then I loaded the sticks, I just wanna survive
If quarters goin' for six, you can get 'em for five
The streets got a demand, therefore I gotta supply
If you want it for cheap, homie I got a surprise
I need them

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Juicy J]
If you got money in your pocket, stretch them bands out
In Magic City, strippers call me Mr. Hand Out
I drink a lot of Rose, I helped the brand out
I'll drop a Phantom but don't make me bring that Lamb out
All these rappers on my dick cause my diamonds glisteling
Man I get so much money, why you niggas penny-pinch
A nigga like me don't give a fuck about a price
I got a P. Diddy swag and a Hugh Heffner life
Bitch!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - DJ Paul]
You can hate me, naw but I won't stop now
I been stayin' fly way before the "Stay Fly"
And I been runnin' them dollars like I'm Mayweather the boxer
And I been winnin' like Khaled way before I won my Oscar
Been pimpin' in mansions, buy all God's blessings
I'm stackin' numbers, taxin' you stackin' numbers, textin'
A lot of people questionin' my career choices I made
But I wouldn't trade today cause everyday I get paid

[Hook]
