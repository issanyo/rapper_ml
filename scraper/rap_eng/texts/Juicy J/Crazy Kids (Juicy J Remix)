[Chorus: Ke$ha]
Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big and shine like stars
And we don't give a fuck 'cause that's just who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
Them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
We are the, we are the crazy people

[Verse 1: Ke$ha]
I see ya in the club showing Ke$ha love
Ain't trippin' on them bitches that be hatin'
Catch a dub, chuck a deuces
Y'all hatin's useless
It's such a nuisance
Y'all chickens keep your two cents
And keep your dollars, keep your loot
I'm fresher than that Gucci
Them boys, they want my coochie
I say "Nope, I'm no hoochie"
Your homegirl hatin'
I say "Who she?"
Ke$ha don't give two fucks
I came to start the ruckus
And ya wanna party with us
Cause we crazy motherfuckas

[Chorus: Ke$ha]
Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big and shine like stars
And we don't give a fuck 'cause that's just who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
Them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
We are the, we are the crazy people

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Uh-huh!
Let's get crazy, let's live it up
I get plenty bitches, can't get enough
Wake up on 'em, damn, there's breakfast on bed
Just orange juice, no bacon and eggs
My system is loud, my weed is louder
In the club, make it rain, no scattered showers
A little bit of that, a whole lot of this
Ta-ta-ta-ta-take your pick
I got bands, I got bands, bring a chick, bring your friend
Like they bopping for apples, how they do it with no hands
Baby girl, lose your man, let's disappear
Juicy J so fly, I come with landing gear
Get me later, where she fuck free
Cause she wanna meet, they mu-must be driven
In Miami on the beach with the college girls
'Bout to take these freaks to Molly world

[Chorus: Ke$ha]
Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big and shine like stars
And we don't give a fuck 'cause that's just who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
Them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
We are the, we are the crazy people

[Bridge: Ke$ha]
This is all we've got and then it's gone
You call us the crazy ones
But we gon' keep on dancing 'til the dawn
'Cause you know the party never ends
And tomorrow we gonna do it again
We the ones that play hard, we live hard
We love hard, we light up the dark

[Chorus: Ke$ha]
Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big and shine like stars
And we don't give a fuck 'cause that's just who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
Them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
We are the, we are the crazy people
