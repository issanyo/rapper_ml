[Intro]
I'm going to Miami this weekend bruh
I'ma hit up all the motherfuckin' strip clubs and leave a green carpet
Everywhere I go

[Hook]
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet
Got these bitches tip-toeing on a green carpet
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet
Got these bitches tip-toeing on a green carpet
Walking on a green, green carpet
'bout to leave the strip club and leave a green carpet
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet
Leave these hoes tip-toeing on a green carpet
Walking on a green

[Verse 1]
First I start my night out with plenty shots
Then I tell the owner send me plenty thots
Naw bitch, I ain't throwin' none' 'til them panties drop
Don't need no ice for my drink, my chain got plenty rocks
They say that money talk, my pockets got a lot to say
If you let your money talk I bet you ain't got nothing to say
You can see me tipping from a mile away
Depend on how I'm feeling, you just might retire today
I know I just met you, but I just might bless you
I can tell you tryna get it and I just might let you
All these niggas at you, got you feeling special
I'm just getting started and I got you

[Hook]
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet
Got these bitches tip-toeing on a green carpet
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet
Got these bitches tip-toeing on a green carpet
Walking on a green, green carpet
'bout to leave the strip club and leave a green carpet
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet
Leave these hoes tip-toeing on a green carpet
Walking on a green

[Verse 2]
Got her walking on the green
So she on' do me and my team
She holding on so tight to the pipe she remind me of a fiend
I been throwing money all damn night, this remind me of a dream
Soon as I walk in Magic City, bet you they gon' treat me like a king
Cause I'm dripping nothing but sauce
I pay the cost to be the boss
One thing I can't tell you is how to take a loss
One thing I can show these niggas is how to floss
Baby girl won't even play with it, she gon' go and take it off
Pimp game, I don't have none
He handcuff, he arrest y'all
Fuck with me, like a vacay I promise you I won't stress y'all
He call you, don't answer, what he want, don't matter
I'm 'bout to, look at you, I gotcha

[Hook]
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet
Got these bitches tip-toeing on a green carpet
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet
Got these bitches tip-toeing on a green carpet
Walking on a green, green carpet
'bout to leave the strip club and leave a green carpet
Walking on a green, walking on a green carpet
Leave these hoes tip-toeing on a green carpet
Walking on a green
