[Intro]
Yeah, Lex, man, we killin' these muh'fuckin' fools, mane
You know what I'm sayin'?
These niggas be crazy about these bitches, mane

[Hook]
Ballin' on your bitch in the club, buckets
Buckets, buckets (buckets, buckets, buckets)
I got all my chains while you niggas tuckin'
Tuckin', tuckin' (tuckin', tuckin', tuckin')
You hatin' what I'm doing but your bitch love it
She love it (love it), she love it (love it), she love it (love it)
That's why I'm balling on your bitch in the club, buckets
Buckets, buckets, buckets (buckets, buckets, buckets)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, nigga (uh, huh)
Ballin' on your bitch like a fade away
First, I got to bang it like an 808
Here comes Superman tryin' to save the day
She see all this ice on me, she's tryin' to skate away
You save all your money for a rainy day
I'm the weatherman everyday a rainy day, nigga
And it's a light chance of snow, too
Fuck you looking at? I can snatch your hoe, too
I'm ballin' in the club, I feel like Jimmy Buckets
Bucket after bucket, your bitch wanna suck it
Fill it up with nothin' but that Bombay, fuck it
Hey, let her pop a bottle now I gotta bust it

[Hook]
Ballin' on your bitch in the club, buckets
Buckets, buckets (buckets, buckets, buckets)
I got all my chains while you niggas tuckin'
Tuckin', tuckin' (tuckin', tuckin', tuckin')
You hatin' what I'm doing but your bitch love it
She love it (love it), she love it (love it), she love it (love it)
That's why I'm balling on your bitch in the club, buckets
Buckets, buckets, buckets (buckets, buckets, buckets)

[Verse 2]
First, I wash that Lamb off then I hit the cash vault
Then I hit the local strip club and drop a bag off
Then I get some Blue Dream, ballin' up the gym
Make it rain 'til it flood, now the strippers gotta swim
This gon' be a long night, we gon' go up all night
Both my pockets stuffed, ain't no such thing as the wrong price
She wanna go home with me, told lil' mama, "Hold tight"
She not all that fine, she look better in a strobe light
Running outta dough (dough), send me up some more (mo')
Spent a night in Magic for the third night in a row (row)
She my favorite hoe (hoe), I might take her home (home)
Paralyze that pussy when I'm gone off that Patrone
Yeah Hoe!

[Hook]
Ballin' on your bitch in the club, buckets
Buckets, buckets (buckets, buckets, buckets)
I got all my chains while you niggas tuckin'
Tuckin', tuckin' (tuckin', tuckin', tuckin')
You hatin' what I'm doing but your bitch love it
She love it (love it), she love it (love it), she love it (love it)
That's why I'm balling on your bitch in the club, buckets
Buckets, buckets, buckets (buckets, buckets, buckets)
