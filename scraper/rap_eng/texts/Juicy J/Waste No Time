[Intro]
Get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up bitch, get up
Get up, get up, get up bitch, get up
Get up, get up, get up bitch, get up

[Hook]
Bitch, I got a lot on my mind
So I'm just tryna have a good time
Roll sum'n smoke sum'n one time
And I ain't tryna waste no time
Ay, I'm just tryna have a good time
And I ain't tryna waste no time
I ain't tryna wait in no line
Cause I ain't tryna waste no time

[Verse 1]
Yeah nigga
I brought all this money out the crib to fuck it up
I can't even lie, all the bitches wanna fuck with us
I just bought like thirty bottles, but there's not enough
Nigga thinkin he can ball with me, I gotta call his bluff
I get it bustin soon as I step foot off in the party
Ain't no talkin we bout action we gon get it started
Pay attention, I'mma show you how to really party
Cause ain't no question, I'm the realest nigga here regardless
I pull up, hop out, and I tell the valet keep it close
That's a half a mil I'm whippin I ain't mean to boast
Maison Margielas, Versace, yeah I do the most
She asked my why I go so hard, I told her she should know that...

[Hook]
Bitch, I got a lot on my mind
So I'm just tryna have a good time
Roll sum'n smoke sum'n one time
And I ain't tryna waste no time
Ay, I'm just tryna have a good time
And I ain't tryna waste no time
I ain't tryna wait in no line (no line)
Cause I ain't tryna waste no time, no time

[Verse 2]
Ain't got not time to waste, cause I ain't tryna wait
I'm feelin good so I might smoke me like a pound a day
You catch me up in the party, it's goin down today
I'm usually drinkin Bombay, but I'm drinkin brown today
I got my Rollie on, I got the ring to match
Smokin Illuminati, you never seen this pack
I get so high, I feel like I'm never coming back
If you looking for me, I be where it's bustin at
I'm with my nigga G-O, you know he keep some freak hoes
I swear to god this shit to easy, it feel like a free-throw
I'm with my nigga Wiz, you know we handle biz
Ain't fuckin with you fraud niggas cause you counterfeit

[Hook]
Bitch, I got a lot on my mind
So I'm just tryna have a good time
Roll sum'n smoke sum'n one time
And I ain't tryna waste no time (hell naw)
Ay, I'm just tryna have a good time (hey, hey)
And I ain't tryna waste no time
I ain't tryna wait in no line (ay, ay)
Cause I ain't tryna waste no time, no time (ay, ay)

[Outro]
We gon' go to every club in Sri Lanka
We gon' lit them motherfuckers up!
You hear me right, nigga? UP!
That's all we thinkin, goin by the word "up"
It's time to celebrate
