[Hook: Keyshia Cole]
Why does it matter now
Who can do you better
Feet up on your couch
Yeah bitch I'm Rick James
Yeah bitch I'm Rick James
Yeah bitch I'm Rick James
Slap a bitch like Rick James
I'm Rick James

[Verse 1: Keyshia Cole]
I gave you all my love
Who's the one whose hurting now
But you can't keep your double standards
Is funny how the tables turned around
Oooh Bring em out out out out
Oooh Right now now now now
Oooh Bring em out out out out
Oooh Right now now now now

[Hook (2X)]

[Verse 2: Keyshia Cole]
I can see the picture shattered
We can't pick the pieces of the ground
Till the point that nothing matters
And it's way too late to talk it out
Oooh Bring em now now now now
Oooh right now now now now
Oooh Bring em now now now now
Oooh right now now now now

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Dog shorty out
And you gon' pay for it later
Baby girl more cutthroat than a razor
She know what she want
And she know how to get it
Shorty know the game
Nah, nigga, you can't play her
She bad, lookin' like a bag of money
Make her own bread
Fat ass and flat stomach
She know she ain't ever gotta ask for nothin'
These chicks hatin' cause they ain't half the woman
Shawty came home and starting runnin' his mouth
He took his earrings off and got ratchet
Homeboy know lil' mama don't play he just grab the shit and starting packin'
Broke her heart homie, Now yo life in a change
She cold blooded like she got ice in his veins
Got me chillin' in your house
Throwin' diamonds on your spouse
Wipe my feet on your couch
Bitch I'm rick james

[Hook (2x)]
