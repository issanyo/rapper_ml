[Al Pacino as "Tony Montana: Intro"]
Do you know what a hassa is?
That's a pig that don't fly straight

[Juicy J: Intro through Hook]
They got us fucked up

[Juicy J: Hook]
Niggas talkin' shit they got us fucked up
Nigga where I'm from nobody puff the stuff
We bust a nigga head till the white meat
And we don't give a fuck nigga
Call the police (x2)

[Juicy J: Verse 1]
You been a bitch my nigga
Why the fuck you talkin' shit
I got one off in the chamber
And got six in the clip
I don't think you niggas you want it so quit playin' wit
Ya self
I'm a real street nigga bitch I live by my rep
I ain't never been a pussy
Just ask the hood about me
I bet them niggas tell ya
Bitch I been about it
Neva am I slippin'
I keep tha heater wit' me
Jackas tryin' rob me
You must not have plan on livin'
When you see the black mask holdin' on the smithin'
Weston if you want a lesson
Don't be testin pimpin'
Real goons from the North
Theyll have you missin'
Body stuffed in tha dump
Chopped up like some chillins

[Juicy J: Verse 2]
It's word on the town
That Juicy J is back around
In the hood
Posted up
Makin' all these rounds
Niggas call me Godfather cause I put it down
Throw some bread wit' my guys help them off the ground
And niggas still be hatin' but I get it now
They just some broke ass niggas that ain't got no house
They just some niggas that been hatin' that ain't got no
Car
They just some niggas that be sleepin' somewhere in a
Park
