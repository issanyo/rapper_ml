[Verse 1: Juicy J]
All my guys we on the town
Drinking Hennessy, passing blunts around
On my way to the strip club, all niggas live in the strip club
OG kush we ain't smoking no brown
Got 20 racks I'ma throw it in the crowd
On my way to the strip club, all niggas live in the strip club
Nothin' but a gangster party
We gon' go retarded

Pass out on the carpet
And I'm looking for a sexy chick
Suck dick nigga work that dick
So fine better work that pole
Even know how to roll a blunt quick

[Hook]
