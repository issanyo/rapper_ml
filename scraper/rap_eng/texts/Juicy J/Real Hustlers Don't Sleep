[Intro: Juicy J]
Get your motherfucking paper up
And quit hating on other niggas, man
Man, y'all niggas is crazy out here, man
While you niggas be out here with that bullshit!?
You already know where I'm gonna be at â€“
The motherfucking bank

[Hook: Juicy J]
Real hustlers don't sleep, we take a nap
Cigarillo full of hairy shit, balled up like naps
Got my eyes on you snakes, like craps
On a paper chase, and you haters get lapped
Real hustlers don't sleep, we take a nap
Cigarillo full of hairy shit, balled up like naps
Got my eyes on you snakes, like craps
On a paper chase, and you haters get lapped

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Hood nigga, but a good dude
Good nigga, but a hood dude
Shit, you don't know what I been through
So you don't know what I could do
They hating on me, they talk down
They talk threats, that's good news
Margiela, RAF Simons
Them Rick Owens is good shoes
Getting paid, I'm in a good mood
Old school, slabs in it
Grill, 24 karats in it
Courtesy of my black dentist
Trill bitch ad-libbing
That's what I call eloquent
I'm getting brain, she sucking dick
That's what I call intelligence
Tell a fella, tell a gent
Tell a friend, and tell a friend
All I fuck is lesbians
Fuck her 'til she celibate
White bitches love Taylor Swift
Tell that bitch I'm hella swift
Hustling everyday
With my twin and Juicy J

[Hook]
Real hustlers don't sleep, we take a nap
Cigarillo full of hairy shit, balled up like naps
Got my eyes on you snakes, like craps
On a paper chase, and you haters get lapped
Real hustlers don't sleep, we take a nap
Cigarillo full of hairy shit, balled up like naps
Got my eyes on you snakes, like craps
On a paper chase, and you haters get lapped

[Verse 2: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Hi guys, what's up, bitch
My name is Purrp
I'm fucking your bitch, and
I made her squirt
I'm going to be rich, as
I put in work
She's all on my dick, as
I made her squirt
Mind will get hurt
My lyrics merk
Niggas with triggas
And find them in dirt
Man, I like to flirt
I'm all in her skirt
I smash it, and pass it
And watch that bitch twerk
One day, one day
You know I'm going to become a
God of the fucking country
Do what you want to, see gunplay

[Hook]
Real hustlers don't sleep, we take a nap
Cigarillo full of hairy shit, balled up like naps
Got my eyes on you snakes, like craps
On a paper chase, and you haters get lapped
Real hustlers don't sleep, we take a nap
Cigarillo full of hairy shit, balled up like naps
Got my eyes on you snakes, like craps
On a paper chase, and you haters get lapped

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
You not getting money, man, you already tired
I'm finna buy a private jet, bitch I'm getting flyer
Juicy J the boss, ain't no way I'm getting fired
I'm on too much shit to name, ain't no way I'm getting higher
I been chasing money since a young nigga from Memphis
I see dead presidents, I think I got 6 senses
Yeah, we on the money train, you just rock the benches
On the purple and the yellow; call it Barney and the Simpsons
Out in Taiwan, smoking Cheech and Chong
Roll it in a cigarillo, chief it in a bong
Ask me what I'm doing, getting high and counting money
And I'm counting all day 'cause the money keep coming

[Hook]
Real hustlers don't sleep, we take a nap
Cigarillo full of hairy shit, balled up like naps
Got my eyes on you snakes, like craps
On a paper chase, and you haters get lapped
Real hustlers don't sleep, we take a nap
Cigarillo full of hairy shit, balled up like naps
Got my eyes on you snakes, like craps
On a paper chase, and you haters get lapped
