[Verse 1]
My niggas [Skinny, Gin and] Scarecrow's always gettin' they fuckin' duck sicked
When I get to fuckin' my hoes I'm dumpin' them tr-izz-icks like down in a ditch
Paul, he get them groupie hoochies runnin' to that purple thang
[Lil Fly slangin'] dope and 'caine, stay about that hustle mane
Crunchy Black keep sweatin' that dope track, got them junky bitches comin' back
Bet he got that gat, let that shit ka-rat-a-tat with that blood all on my cross cause a nigga bit the dust
Seasonally I pop the slug, bitch the Koopsta Knicca don't give a fuck
I read the Revelation, think about my situation
Waitin' on a low wage job but in my heart I have no patience
Call up my nigga friend to hit 'em with a (?) ten
I had to touch 'em, had to stick 'em for them dividends
And barred the niggas up out my hood and send a fuckin' shot
Who called the folks?
Who called the feds?
Who called the fucking cops?
Oh well, I won't be sittin' up in a jail cell
To make my pockets swell I make you bitches burn in hell

[Verse 2]
Nigga should finna be droppin' the green, I be down and the Koopsta ain't comin' clean
I'm makin' them stangs, I'm splittin' they brains, I'm droppin' these bitches off somethin' mane
Bitches be testin' my pimpin' as if I really was a babbage nigga
Comin' straight outta that North for real-la, the Koopsta Knicca's a cap peeler
Though I'm not like Dracula but bitch this time it's a psycho man
A bloody Glock mister, blood stuck in the chest, bitch the Koopsta the Knicca's a scandalous
Winter, spring, summer, fall, oh fella I'm creepin' in all types of weather
Knockin' these tricks in like down in a ditch, break a bitch quick, I love this shit
I break my fuckin' black back slangin' crack up on that dope track
A bitch tried to creep my shit, trick so I dropped off something like that
That bizness with that sh-izz-it l-izz-ead caliber, nigga d-izz-ick
Murder-murder, redruM, body numb in a ditch, trick
With a bunch of bitches wrapped up in some plastic, they got blasted
I took yo shit and sorry bitch, you gets no fuckin' casket
Nothin' but some bullet lead stuck in your motherfuckin' head
Triple 6 engraved in red got you busta bitches scared
