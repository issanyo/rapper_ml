[Intro]
Hey mane, have you ever had that one chick that huh..
You know, you would do anything for
Cause you feel like she the one
DatPiffPremiere.com World
Let's get it

[Chorus]
Only for you I will go get the new foreign
Only for you I will go buy a Patek
Only for you I will put you in Gucci and Louis
And ice at your wrist and your neck
Only for you I could say I'm committed
Only for you I could show some respect
Only for you I can ignore them bitches
And not even thinking about hitting 'em back

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, fuck with a real nigga, fuck that nigga
Don't pick up, fuck that nigga
Hey, fuck with a real nigga, fuck that nigga
Don't cry, fuck that nigga
He ain't like me, fuck that nigga
You don't even really love that nigga
You don't really trust that nigga
You don't even wanna fuck that nigga

[Verse]
I've done got tired of creepin' on the low
What you wanna do, got a let a nigga know
I can get you everything out the store
I can take you where you wanna go
Whip game on his and hers, Hermes blue shoes and furs
Too much bread in her purse, she spoiled, I make it worse
Yeah, she's like a bad influence, she fuck up the bag, we ruined
She act like she know the plug (uh), she act like she know what she doin'
Hey, I don't care none 'bout all these other lil bitches and what they be doin'
None of these niggas like me but I know I got all these niggas influenced

[Chorus]
Only for you I will go get the new foreign
Only for you I will go buy a Patek
Only for you I will put you in Gucci and Louis
And ice at your wrist and your neck
Only for you I could say I'm committed
Only for you I could show some respect
Only for you I can ignore them bitches
And not even thinking about hitting 'em back

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, fuck with a real nigga, fuck that nigga
Don't pick up, fuck that nigga
Hey, fuck with a real nigga, fuck that nigga
Don't cry, fuck that nigga
He ain't like me, fuck that nigga
You don't even really love that nigga
You don't really trust that nigga
You don't even wanna fuck that nigga

[Verse 2]
Run that check up, pull your dress up, he ain't like me, tell him back up
She go crazy when I flex up, you done fucked up, now I'm next up
She got ass on her for days, now it's time to step up her breast cup
Got her legs up in the air just like a mothafuckin' Tesla
I got codeine, I got ganja, I look like I got a sponsor
She direct me like a compass, In her throat just like tonsils
Bought some ice to cool you out, put you up then pull you out
You in the club, I'm in the streets, by the end of the night you on my couch

[Chorus]
Only for you I will go get the new foreign
Only for you I will go buy a Patek
Only for you I will put you in Gucci and Louis
And ice at your wrist and your neck
Only for you I could say I'm committed
Only for you I could show some respect
Only for you I can ignore them bitches
And not even thinking about hitting 'em back

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, fuck with a real nigga, fuck that nigga
Don't pick up, fuck that nigga
Hey, fuck with a real nigga, fuck that nigga
Don't cry, fuck that nigga
He ain't like me, fuck that nigga
You don't even really love that nigga
You don't really trust that nigga
You don't even wanna fuck that nigga
