[Hook x2]
I promise I ain't sparin niggas, no, not at all
Give a fuck about who ridin' with ya they can get it dawg
We can shoot or we can fight, nigga we can do it all
But I promise I ain't sparin niggas, no, not at all

[Verse 1]
You niggas ain't hard, pussy niggas what you are
You wanna hate on me, than you wanna hate my car
You see me ridin through the streets with some stupid bitches
Erry week a new whip, I be stupid flippin
I'm smoking good homie, you niggas so phoney
I got a chopper for your ass, like that nigga Tony
Montana, plenty guns, plenty bandanas
Plenty goons, plenty gangs, plenty bandanas

[Hook]
I promise I ain't sparin niggas, no, not at all
Give a fuck about who ridin' with ya they can get it dawg
We can shoot or we can fight, nigga we can do it all

[Verse 2]
I see them niggas mugging me, when I'm in the VIP
They can smell my weed smoke and they know is Cali
I done made so much money, bitches know who I be
I done done so many drugs, I might need an I.V
Any car that you name Juicy J he got keys
Any ho that you claim, in her throat real deep
Step in my circle man triggers gone squeeze
They won't recognize your face, they gone need yo ID

[Hook]
I promise I ain't sparin niggas, no, not at all
Give a fuck about who ridin' with ya they can get it dawg
We can shoot or we can fight, nigga we can do it all
