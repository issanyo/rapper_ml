[Hook]
(damn)
Bow down to your king, God level
God level, Kill several
Nigga bow down, this god level
We god level I'm god level (yeah hoe)

[Pre-Verse]
Call Zeus and Poseidon
Imma get her wet no trident
Strike the game like lightning
God level so frightening (aye)

[Verse 1]
All of my niggas are ride or dies
Try fucking with 'em thats suicide
Life is a game you should choose a side
You ain't qualify you dont side with mine
Fly or die imma rep threes
So you could find me up in the breeze
Celsius with my cold heart
Nigga never switching we gon get degrees
I get cash you in check nigga
Swipe the paper get left nigga
Moral code, Im all-right nigga
Need tic tacs in my breath nigga
Halitosis with the flame
Nigga know the name, I dont fuck with lame
I dont get the brain know my edge straight
But she still down when I give the say

[Hook]
Bow down to your king, god level
God level, kill several
Nigga bow down, this god level
We god level, I'm god level

[Pre-Verse]
Call Zeus and Poseidon
Imma get her wet no trident
Strike the game like lightning
God level so frightening

[Verse 2]
(aye, aye, aye, aye)
Type of pressure make Cole diamond
Fuck a plaque im still shining
Dumb niggas need to be reminded
God Level imma fucking titan
Call Percy Jackson if you want that action
Smith and Wesson they gon get to blasting
Break the mold had to box with Cassius
Back to the bank we be fucking laughing
Bounce with it like a fucking rabbit
Kill the beat shit is super tragic
Bruce Wayne with that fucking back bend
Shield a nigga when I get to Cappin
Call Poseidon for that titanic
Deep depression had the kid manic
Popping adderral im invici-ball
Imma fucking god Imma slay you all

[Hook]
Bow down to your king, god level
God level, kill several
Nigga bow down, this god level
We god level, I'm god level

[Outro]
This that god feeling (woo)
Mirage feeling (woo)
Money in the ceiling
Praise the lord
Up from your seats
And feel that force
This that god feeling (woo)
Mirage feeling (woo)
Money in the ceiling
Praise the lord
Up from your seats
And feel that force
