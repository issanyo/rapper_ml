[Intro]
Nigga, that chick you fucking with, she's no good
I'm just keeping it real my nigga, and shes just fucked every nigga with money
Football players, basketball players, rappers, if a nigga got bread man, hes gonna get that pussy man
As long as he got that sack and them drugs to get a bitch, she gonna go
Don't fuck with her, bruh

[Hook]
You knew she was a bitch when you met the bitch
So why you wanna sweat and wanna threat the bitch?
When you see another nigga gettin' at the bitch
Ain't that about a bitch? A bitch gon' be a bitch

[Verse 1]
How you love that dirty bitch when you know her past?
How you kiss her when you know she let your homie smash?
And everybody know her as the neighborhood hoe
You don't wanna face the facts, you won't let her go
You turn that ratchet bitch into your baby mama
Boy, that pussy got you blind like Stevie Wonder
That's fucked up, might may even be your baby
Turn a hoe into a house wife, you niggas crazy
Stupid nigga, now you wanna put a ring on her
We come to your town, do a show and run a train on her
She love that shit, that freaky bitch
Handcuffin' ass nigga, wanna keep that bitch
Don't save that hoe, she don't wanna be saved
I'm about to scoop your bitch up and put it in her face
Sorry homie, but that everybody bitch
If I take her on my bus, I bet everybody hit

[Hook]
You knew she was a bitch when you met the bitch
So why you wanna sweat and wanna threat the bitch?
When you see another nigga gettin' at the bitch
Ain't that about a bitch? A bitch gon' be a bitch
You knew she was a bitch when you met the bitch
So why you wanna sweat and wanna threat the bitch?
When you see another nigga gettin' at the bitch
Ain't that about a bitch? A bitch gon' be a bitch

[Verse 2]
They thot diggin' in the club tryna find a victim
Man, these nigga out they mind fallin' for these bitches
They fuckin' any nigga with a little money
And you wanna take her home and make her your women
It be the main niggas claim they pimpin'
Pay that dirty bitch bills, nigga you must be kiddin'
The bitch ain't got no job, the bitch got 3, 4 kids
Can't get mad at the hoe, she get it how she live
She suck me good while you goin' to work
Old sneaky ass bitch keep rubbers in her purse
Get that bitch in VIP and she gon' fuck for free
You buy that bitch a drink she might not ever leave
Get her to the room, now she on her knees
She just my kind of freak, she swallow faithfully
Sorry homie, but that's everybody hoe
And the sad part about it is you already know

[Hook]
You knew she was a bitch when you met the bitch
So why you wanna sweat and wanna threat the bitch?
When you see another nigga gettin' at the bitch
Ain't that about a bitch? A bitch gon' be a bitch
You knew she was a bitch when you met the bitch
So why you wanna sweat and wanna threat thE bitch?
When you see another nigga gettin' at the bitch
Ain't that about a bitch? A bitch gon' be a bitch
