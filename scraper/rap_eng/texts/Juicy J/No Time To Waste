[Chorus: Cory Jones]
Baby, we don't all night, ain't no time to waste
You said that you want it now, come and get it
(Get it girl)
Baby, it's on now, you gotta hit it
Don't talk about it, be about it, show me something
Don't talk about it, be about it, show me something
Don't talk about it, be about it, baby, come on

[Verse 1: GVND]
I said baby come on over, we ain't got time to be wasting
I can show you how I live, and take you to all of these places
Where you see me on vacation, London's where I'm stationed
I can't even lie, your touch is what I'm craving
And I, need it, yeah you know I need it
Whenever I'm away, baby girl you got me fiending
You know that I'ma be there, ASAP
Just so I can have you lying down next to me
Now you're undressing me, you ain't even waste a second
You say you wanna make the most of me up in your presence
Cos time is of the essence, and you already know that
So you walking round the house, nothing on but my throwback
And then she throw that, cos she ain't even need that
We be up all night, like I'm an insomniac
She see that, so she up all night too
And now I know for sure, girl, all I want is you

[Chorus: Cory Jones]
Baby, we don't all night, ain't no time to waste
You said that you want it now, come and get it
(Get it girl)
Baby, it's on now, you gotta hit it
Don't talk about it, be about it, show me something
Don't talk about it, be about it, show me something
Don't talk about it, be about it, baby, come on

[Verse 2]
You said you're ready, really now you're ready
I be up in all of your dreams call me Freddy
You know I get it wetter than a couple broke levees
And once we go and finish baby girl you breathing heavy
Now inhale, we can start on over, ain't got no time to waste
So baby come on closer
Cos we supposed to, be together til the end
All I need in this life, is me and my girlfriend
It's alright, as long you are by my side
Everyone knows you a dime like the number after nine
Everyone knows that you're fine, and I can see them looking
But I can't even blame em, really though who wouldn't?
That body and them eyes, they really got me trippin'
So when we get into it, best believe I'll go the distance
You my genie in a bottle now give me my three wishes
Number one, how about you be my missus?
Number two, how bout we get to kissing?
And number three, I'ma let you finish
Now listen, really listen to this song
And let the hook tell you how we got it going on

[Chorus: Cory Jones]
Baby, we don't all night, ain't no time to waste
You said that you want it now, come and get it
(Get it girl)
Baby, it's on now, you gotta hit it
Don't talk about it, be about it, show me something
Don't talk about it, be about it, show me something
Don't talk about it, be about it, baby, come on
