Said we can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
Said we can't go no mo

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
I know you like it on the bed
You know I like it when it bounce
And when I'm pulling your hair
I be pulling tracks out
Love fiend, I know what it's about
Baby I know what you want and I'mma work it out
Oh yeah

[Pre-Hook]
Spontaneous, love-making like we're famous
Earth shaking, and we're faded
I got a whole new plan for you baby
Sex-rated

[Hook: Jeremih]
Let's stay and turn off the phone
It's just you and me girl
Don't tell nobody that you're home
That's how it's supposed to be girl
Ride me like you're coming home
You ain't never gotta leave girl
Let's go until we can't go no mo

[Refrain]
Said we can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
(I be up on your body babe, you all up on my body there)
Said we can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
(And I want you to feel the love as much as you feel the pain)
Said we can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
(I be up on your body babe, you all up on my body there)
Said we can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
(And I want you to feel the love...)

[Bridge: Jeremih]
No concept of time, I'm too focused
Too many places baby we can do it, let a nigga know if you're open
Take a little hit of that potion and we can be here all night
And I got you drinking like an ocean, that's how I know I'm doing it right
Damn right

[Pre-Hook]
Spontaneous, love-making like we're famous
Earth shaking, and we're faded
I got a whole new plan for you baby
Sex-rated

[Hook: Jeremih]
Let's stay and turn off the phone
It's just you and me girl
Don't tell nobody that you're home
That's how it's supposed to be girl
Ride me like you're coming home
You ain't never gotta leave girl
Let's go until we can't go no mo

[Refrain]
Said we can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
(I be up on your body babe, you all up on my body there)
Said we can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
(And I want you to feel the love as much as you feel the pain)
Said we can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
(I be up on your body babe, you all up on my body there)
Said we can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
(And I want you to feel the love...)

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Baby you know I can do you like nobody else
I be swimming in it like Michael Phelps
Come with me and see bigger things
The kind of things you only see in dreams
We can get faded like denim jeans
And let your body talk in the limousine
Yo, I beat it up like a punching bag
Give me one night, I bet you be running back
On one when I'm drunk and high
I can fuck you all night you gon' need a nap
Bring it back in, first show me your secrets
You gon' slip out of your Secrets
And we can fuck like we're animals
Shawty they gon' have to call PETA
I just beat it, beat it break you off and leave you speechless
'Til you can't feel your legs turn you into a paraplegic
Baby a shot of penicillin ain't as dope as me
Shawty we can hit the strip club overseas
Yeah, my chick she super freak, she super wet, it's super leak
Dripping like she supposed to be

[Refrain]
Said we can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
(I be up on your body babe, you all up on my body there)
Said we can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
(And I want you to feel the love as much as you feel the pain)
Said we can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
(I be up on your body babe, you all up on my body there)
Said we can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
Can't go no mo
(And I want you to feel the love...)
