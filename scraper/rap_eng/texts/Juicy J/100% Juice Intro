[Intro: Juicy J (Wiz Khalifa)]
Play me some of that Abel pimpin' mane
(Take another dab, blow the smoke out like its hookah)
100% Juice, I made this mixtape, cause
I want my niggas to have somethin' to
(Take another dab, blow the smoke out like its hookah)
To get 'em some motivation
To get high to, ya know what I'm sayin'?
Its too much, stupid ass shit happenin' right now mane, Its time to
(Take another dab, blow the smoke out like its hookah)
Just turn up mane, don't worry 'bout that shit mane
Let somebody else deal with that shit, ya know what I'm sayin'
We gon' do our thang, ya know what I'm sayin'
(Take another dab, blow the smoke out like its hookah)
Trippy niggas mane, don't stress yourself mane
You know, life is short, enjoy that shit mane while we here
Let's go my nigga, let's get it
SHUT THE FUCK UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
