[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
We finally got a warm day, it's late in January, see
I hopped out of my drop top once again we rollin chevy
Pearl paint, quarter green top, and them gold Ds
Dirty bitches choosin I can't go, I just say hoes please
Ballin clean past I'm holdin tight to my woodgrain
System bumpin greatest hits, weed smoke invade my brain
Time to get it sprayed, niggas steal every color I get
Everytime I make one up some fool tr-iz-y to come with it
Smokin on a dime, more than a quarter, whats that - a 35?
Higher than a mile above the moon on that black haven side
Sturdy inhalin on some Satan, Lord knows I canâ€™t live without it
Everytime a flame penetrates some bud I wanna shout about it
But these niggas kill me when that's all they wanna do
Pockets fucked up, but they still wanna get fucked up, you's a damn fool
So I be like watchin you fools go down more every single day
While I ride clean, drop top and mean, chevrolet, busta

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Scopin' these niggas out on the next block cause I know that they hoe asses pushin' them pounds
They blew my whole sale, fuckin' up my mail, so I gotta close 'em down
They got niggas standing 'round with much artillery, but Scarecrow not scared
Fuckin' up my damn business, I called up the Triple 6, we catch them tricks unprepared
A partner of mine said they (?) so we (?) rackin' a plenty of stacks
I brought all my niggas, we polished the triggers, I figured its time for the jack
Paul took the sack, Skinny took the back, Koop took the room on the front
My nigga Mal took out the window with the Mossberg pump
I started droppin' niggas runnin' out into the parking lot
Skinny started popping tricks at the back dawg, he grabbed 'bout a pound of crop
My nigga Koop blasted them niggas we missed from on the roof
Paul running with the Tech and a vest, he blast them bitches and grabbed the loot
Dead bodies were scattered all over the cut, we drove off in the smoke
Now we got plenty money bitch and we gonna serve plenty of dope
There's no survivors, just the blood scattered all over the place
We built our smoked out, loced out in the fuckin' Chevrolet

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Is it the Marijuana that got my mind clickin'?
Could it be Erk and Jerk that got me straight trippin'?
Dippin' through the breeze, you so clean, Paul you so mean
A nigga drunk as hell, liqour flowin' through my bloodstream
Flaggin' down hoes on the road, roll to the cut
Honeycomb hideout
Where them niggas be smoked out on them blunts
Malachi, you so high, let me hit that grapefruit gin
Jumped back in that pearl thang, doin' about 110
Grin on my face, cause I know I'm 'bout to make it rich
Triple 6 Mafia '95, yeah we runnin' shit
Niggas know the score, I'm ten toes on these funky hoes
Everytime you see the Chevy ridin' it be full of smoke

[Outro: DJ Paul & Sample]
Aw yeah nigga ridin in the chevy for the 95
