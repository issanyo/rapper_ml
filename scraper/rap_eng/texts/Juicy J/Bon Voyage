[Verse 1: Vali]
Boy looking at you
Got me thinking of a rendezvous
Be my captain draw the map and don't think about a thing
You know we gotta make it happen
Babe you lookin at me
Got me thinking of a little fantasy
Baby you know
Nothing better than an open road
Nothing better than a love like you

[Pre-Hook]
You can just quit it and come along with it
Boy don't toy with my love just come and get it- you dig it
I'm thinking we should leave here in a minute- I mean it
So pack up your bags, and come along with it.

[Hook]
Come away with me
Run away with me
Say bon voyage come play with me
Car or plane sailboat or submarine,
Car or plane sailboat or submarine.
(2x)

[Verse 2: Vali]
Boo all I want is you
Let's take a trip where it is just us two
Baby you know
Nothing better than an open road
Nothing better than a love like yours

[Pre-Hook]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Lookin at your cell pictures puts me in the mood
I'm with the mile high club I think I'm Howard Hughs
Take a flight to St. Tropez just the two of us
Put some carrots on your finger blow your stomach up
I'll give you everything crib car fuck a prenup
I drop them rags on that ass bro she a keeper
And after sex I'm sipping gin while she rolling doobies
We on a yacht from Hollyhood finna make a movie
I want you to dance tonight in the red light
I'mma dress you down like an eskimo all ice
Jet life me and Vali in the G6
With shades on price tags we don't see shit.

[Bridge]
Ohhh lala come away with me
I got the Louis bags packed shorty tell me where we traveling at
Ohhh lala run away with me
Come away with me, come and stay with me
Ohhh lala come away with me
I got the Louis bags packed shorty tell me where we traveling at
Ohhh lala run away with me
Come away with me

[Hook]
