[Intro: Juicy J]
Highly Intoxicated mane
Know what I'm sayin'
Shouts out to my nigga, Big Triece
We mixing that D'Usse with that Ciroc mane
We doin' some new shit
Some next level shit mane
We get fucked up

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I mix D'Usse with Ciroc ('roc!)
That's that diddy bop (bop!)
That's that diddy bop (bop!)
That's that diddy bop (you know it!)
I mix D'Usse with Ciroc (Ciroc!)
That's that diddy bop (bop!)
That's that diddy bop (bop!)
That's that diddy bop (get drunk!)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I mix D'Usse with Ciroc
And I smoke a lot (smoke a lot nigga!)
I got cameras in the spot (they in my spot!)
It ain't no twenties in my knots (mo' faces!)
When I drink, I pour a lot (I can't taste it!)
Got them foreigns in the spot (the driveway!)
I got foreigns in the lot (two hunnit thousand!)

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I got lean up in my pot (qualitest!)
I mix that shit up in the pot (skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt!)
VVS for all my rocks (shinin' on you bitches!)
I got love for all my thots (I still love you bitches!)
I thank god I'm at the top (still lonely though!)
I just might pull up in a drop (vroom!)
I might just pull off on a cop (ok!)
Bitch, don't touch me, I'm too hot

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I mix D'Usse with Ciroc ('roc!)

[Verse 3: SmokePurpp]
Put a deuce inside my wock
Sipping on some drop (huh!)
Bitch, it's Lil Purp
I'm off the percs, I pop a lot (I pop a lot!)
And this lambo, fast (skrt!)
Bitch, I speed a lot (skrt!)
Cop pull up behind me
Hit the gas, 'cause I can't stop (huh!)
I'm in Neiman Marcus (uh!)
Blowin' bags, I'm with a thot
Keep a chopper on me
And you know I geek a lot (geek, geek, huh!)
You on bitch shit (huh!)
I'm on rich shit (huh!)
I just dropped like thirty bands and that's your wishlist (huh, woo!)
Fiends inside my spot (fiends!)
Count a lot of guap (guap!)
Bitch, I diddy bop (bop!)
Every city bop (bop!)
Kick that door and I don't knock (and I don't!)
Plus my bitch is hot (hot!)
They off molly, they off rock

That's that diddy bop (bop!)
