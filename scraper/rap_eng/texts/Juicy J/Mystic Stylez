[Intro: DJ Paul]
Ah yea We finna get ready
To bump that "Smoked out, loced out" part two
Mystic Stylez,  Three 6 mafia in da hoe
We finna do that dat sheeeeeit...

[Hook: Lord Infamous]
Mafia, Mafia, Mafia, Mafia
Mafia, Mafia, Mafia, Mafia
Mafia, Mafia, Mafia, Mafia
Mafia, Mafia, Mafia, Mafia

[Verse 1: Playa Fly]
Bustaz get so dazed and amazed as Lil Fly enchants
Memories of "Smoked out, Loced out" bumped out as them demons dance
Playaz lookin' wild, stole our style, devil's in me so
Fly can get so violent, bustas silent when I'm on that blow
Enhance my skills to make me treal, treal enough to kill at will
Will I kill you? Fly will peel you off da map, that's also real
Don't you mothasuckas often wonder what to call this shit?
Uhmm, call it Mystic Stylez cause Fly's style so mystic bitch

[Verse 2: MC Mack]
The pimpin' Mack is kickin' it with the click that's known as Triple 6
Don't bar no lemon busta niggas we dont love 'em
In a trunk is where I stuff 'em
Suckas run they liquor I deliver nigga hollow thangs
Ain't got no feelings when im killin' clockers best to duck for cover
I come with a chrome yawk and makin' hoes pay the cost
Infared to ya head full of lead yawkin' lames
You can betcha bottom dollar that I'm spittin' game
Niggas underestimate my pimpin' but Mack ain't trippin'
Sprayin', layin' skanky bitches to the canvas and bustas can I man

[Bridge: Lord Infamous]
Mystic Styles of the ancient mutilations
Torture chambers filled with corpses in my basement
Feel the wrath of the fuckin' devilition
Three 6 Mafia: creation of Satan

[Verse 3: Gangsta Boo]
My styles are slick, yo body bitch that I will chop in pieces
No fuckin' clue to da 5-0 click, no fuckin' witnesses an...
They only saw da mask of Jason that I had on my face
The scandalous bitch is so-so slick that why I got away safe
I blaze a blunt up in da air just to relax and get high
Da moon is full and all I see is 6-6-6 in da sky
The Three 6 Mafia, Da Devil's Daughter bitch is so wild
Whateva you bitches are doin' you cannot compare to our mystic style

[Verse 4: La Chat]
I'm creepin' up on these hoes with the muthafuckin' shotgun
My nigga wit tha 9's showin' these bitches they can't get none
Woopin' and dumpin' and stompin' and doggin' these bitches wit animosity
Pimpin' and breakin' and cakin' these niggas cause these hoes can't fuck wit me
La Chat got tha gat, creepin' up from tha back
Chrome tone now it's on, never love a nigga john
Cause I'm a crazy bitch, cuttin' off niggas dicks
Man ho takin' these niggas gotta keep it rich
Bitches be runnin' they mouth about this female they don't know about
Suckas be talkin' that shit, I'm puttin' these funky niggas on da house

[Verse 5: Crunchy Black]
Mystic Styles in my head as I smoke on a blunt
Yo Crunchy Black da demons child has a mean ass stun
I had to buck you off, runnin' yo mouth with that weak ass shit
You need to keep it closed trick before you get yo wig split
The candle light, the demon night is what it have to be
Another problem for tha folks on Unsolved Mysteries
Ya thought I was dead naw instead I just faked on yo ass
And now I'm back wit that mask and I'm ready to blast

[Verse 6: Koopsta Knicca]
Now tell me something has emerged
Legions of demons
Koopsta Knicca finna
Rip 'em in plenty trick
For a date with my smith & wesson
Bitch you living
Now you cowards waitin' to bite our fuckin' style
Rip his legs
Cut him down
Bitch with mass up in his town
Niggas bout to break ya somethin' off up in that house of torture
Steppin' up to that Koopsta bitch
Da wicked witch of horror
Horror, da chambers, the daemons that came up
To feed on your soul fool be livin' ya anger
Now ya life's in danger

[Verse 7: Lord Infamous]
Evil...
Notice the murderous vocalist Infamous rippin' up all of your hoe shit
Approachin Da Scarecrow'll butchure and tearin' up niggas with double the lyrical dopeness
They go the lyrical legacy, let the Lord Infamous light up da melody
Every nigga that try to compare with the Triple 6 Mafia walkin' to therapy
When you walk throught the wilderness be very quiet, Lord Infamous might be out stalkin'
I suggest you watch out for the booby traps mane cause the Scarecrow is out there only for huntin'
Special thanks to my brother Bill Dunigan, Rest in Peace, he taught me 'bout these mean streets
And so therefore nigga you don't wanna come deal with the mafia, we'll drop you deep down beneath
The killa imperial black miracle from the bloody pacific
Scarecrow will flow to the end of infinity with the style that's mystic

[Verse 8: Juicy J]
Deep when we creep, take yo' last breath
Roll up yo' tombstone, smoke a blunt of death
Beware - the Juice'll leave you funky hoes in terror
And scared of the Mystic Styles of them Three 6 devils
Whoever step up to this click then ya doomed
Cruel with my harpoon straight through yo heart fool
Soon I'll have you in a trance, swearin' hearin' evil chants
Two knives stuck down in my pants, bustas do not stand a chance

[Verse 9: DJ Paul]
See Im'ma cold hearted killa like murderer Al Kapone
Strong as thousand mile winds and quick to break ya bones
A Glock 19, 95 I cause ya early death
Ya walkin' Triple 6 streets so foo watch ya step
We all about makin' that cheese we gotta stay straight mane
Robbin' and workin' these hoes, fool it ain't no thang
I even got virgins servin' for me in some otha nations
Pimpin' so hard that I got locked up for some tax evasion
Killers and thieves is all I ever had the pleasure to meet
A rusty ass Tec 9 will make ya hit ya knee
I'm tryin to keep from blastin' off my muthafuckin' balls
By da one in da chamber of da Glock I got in my draws
I got my cap to the side, watchin' my fuckin' back
My dogs across the street in the grass when I'm sweatin the track
Satan worshipper or thug would be my profile, read my file
I been a mean child for a while within a Mystic Style

[Outro: DJ Paul, Juicy J, Playa Fly, (Gangsta Boo), (LaChat), (Koopsta Knicca), Lord Infamous]
