[Intro]
Yea
Hay
Who Run It?

[Verse]
They On My Dick, For What?
I Ain’t Never Get Bread With Them
I Ain’t Never Shoot A Fair With Them
I Ain’t Never Been A Fan Of Them
Runnin’ Yo Mouth Like Mary, Huh?
We In Yo City We Scared Of What?
Ride Down Yo Block and Tear It Up
Prada Shoe With The Berry Tongue
We Gone Do It Cuz It Ain’t Been Done
Climb To The Top Then Make It Run
OG Did A Lot On Franklin, Huh?
Where You Think A Nigga Get It From?
I Had To Get That Bitch Naked
She Ride My Dick But Can’t Take It
Hatin’ Ass Nigga Won’t Make It
My Life Is Real I Can’t Fake It
Buy Me A Coupe Then I Swerve It (Skrrt)
I Know Them Niggas Can’t Take It
Hit The Strip Club In Suburban
Tell That Lil Bitch To Come Shake It (Wait)
I’m Smackin That Ass
The Money It Bust Out The Bag Now
I Do The Dash
I Brought A Safe For The Cash Now (Wait)
I’m In The Streets
Shakin’ And Dodgin’ The Dee’s
Niggas Be Mad
Who Workin Harder Than Me?
I’m In My Bag
I Cannot Get Any Sleep
She On The Gram
She Tryna Gimme A Peak
My Door It Swang Open
Walk Out That Bitch With That Thang Pokin’
Nigga I Ain’t Jokin’
You Will Get Shot For A Strange Motion
I Am Ahead Of You
Free All Niggas Out Federal
I Make A Move Then A Better Move
I Play Ya Block Like A General
(Hol' Up)
Let Me Switch My Flow Up
Young Nigga From The Mud Had To Get My Dough Up
It Was Poppin’ On My Block and I Ain’t Never Fold Up
We Was Out There With Them Gangstas and Them Baby Souljas
You Was Never With It, You Put On A Show
FN With Extendo Lay You On The Flo
She Gone Suck My Dick, I’m Gone Count My Dough
Album On The Way, Bitch I’m Cookin’ Dope (Flave)
