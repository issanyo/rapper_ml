[Cory Gunz:]
Fuck with my click, no yall just not
Go for my shit, I'm gonna bust shots
I've been leaned down, I'll be highed up
She give me mouth, watch we ride up
I'm so drift out, I can't see shit
But my white cup and my cheese grip
Flow so doped out, I don't fuck round
CMB bitch or just wipe down
Hot top red dunks, camo cargos
I hit that trunk and more arsenal
Stack my bread right, mind your own shit
Pause, get off mine and ride your own dick
Spray at [?]
Bitch I'm so fucked up say I don't stress shit
Stroke through my block get shot to death quick
Get box, get stretch ribs [?] and left ittt

[Hook- Juicy J:]
Fuck the laws, fuck a hater, I'm a gun toter
Keep that Nina on my side yeah I gotta tot her
Fuck a nigga ass up, leave his body totaled
Make his ass pay the price, give him a total x2

[Juicy J:]
I put a ticket on your head just for looking at me wrong
When that thing go off it get quiet like a song
My AK barrel long, I don't know what I be on
But if a nigga out of pocket then I gotta get em wrong
Man down, lay em down, hit the fence, tell'em don't make a sound
My Alibi is that I'm out of town with a foreign bitch getting cap and gown
High as fuck like Bobby Brown and I'm smoking gas by the half of pound
In the strip club in VIP, watching ass go up and down
These niggas lying, sofa niggas dying
I ain't trying to raise the murder rate but these niggas trying me
What it be, got a Glock under my seat
If you're trying to get attention hollow tips you gotta meet

[Hook- Juicy J:]
Fuck the laws, fuck a hater, I'm a gun toter
