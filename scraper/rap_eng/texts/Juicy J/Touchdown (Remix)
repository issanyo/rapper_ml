[Intro: O.T. Genasis]
Word around town, I'm the man
Break that bitch down to the grams
Sixteen O's in a pound
Quarterback drop, touchdown, nigga

[Verse 1: O.T. Genasis]
Touchdown, this the remix
108, three bricks
Gotta move sixteen cause the shit sells
Still flip a couple water bottles, but the shit smell
Turned up, but I don't like niggas
He a mark, Air Nike, nigga
Niggas trippin' and I'm bustin' on site, nigga
Window down, arm out, hitch hike, nigga
Not a stoner, but I do move statue
Hoes in my cashew, they like, is that you?
Glock poppin', I ain't fuckin' with the lames
Sellin' Sherman and I got the best corner in the game, what's up?

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
Word around town, I'm the man, nigga
Break that bitch down to the grams, nigga
Sixteen O's in a pound nigga
Quarterback drop, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Next day air, no ground, nigga

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Got the niggas on the strip, you know they pitch raw
You ain't knowin' who you with, even my bitch ball
Niggas hate the way I handle when they bitch call
Couple ounces for me, sit up in they bitch brah
Major distribution, what we dealin' with is facts
Step up in the building bitch, we turn up to the max
Chop a hater down like we cut him with an axe
Watch him pop 'em in they crown if niggas think they all of that
Spend a little money, (jewelry sicker on 'em)
Put your bottles up (spill your liquor on 'em)
It's the conglomerate, shit shutdown
Taking over everything, touchdown!

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
Word around town, I'm the man, nigga
Break that bitch down to the grams, nigga
Sixteen O's in a pound nigga
Quarterback drop, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Next day air, no ground, nigga

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Word around town, I'm the man nigga
Want it all, bring it down to the grams nigga
Bout it, Coupe 500 grand nigga
You ain't talkin' money, I don't understand nigga
Uptown nigga, bust down nigga
Face down nigga, James Brown nigga
Ass up with your legs shake
Talkin' work know I gotta for the fan base
It ain't how you get it, it's what you do with it
Flip 21, 42 with it
Two hands up, towndown nigga
Hundred grams, lift you with the ground nigga

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
Word around town, I'm the man, nigga
Break that bitch down to the grams, nigga
Sixteen O's in a pound nigga
Quarterback drop, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Next day air, no ground, nigga

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
Juicy J, no days off, full time hustlin'
Shawty I'm the plug I ain't gotta touch nothin'
Send 'em your way, I just gotta press a button
If the price ain't right, nigga I ain't budgin'
Niggas stompin' industries, they rims touchin'
You lookin' like food and we got the munchies
Quarterback legendary, John Elway
Rhyme with the bulldog 38, no shell case
G-5 take off for the coast
A nigga been have more peels than Quaker Oats
Taylor Gang flyin' first class on a paper plane
With a foreign chick broad, still can't pronounce her name
Stuff a 100 grand in a Honda Civic
When you get it from the ground then the sky is the limit
Gettin' face in the car from another nigga broad
Smokin' football fields, rollin' up a 100 yards
Touchdown

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
Word around town, I'm the man, nigga
Break that bitch down to the grams, nigga
Sixteen O's in a pound nigga
Quarterback drop, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown, nigga
Next day air, no ground, nigga

[Outro]
Throw that shit like Peyton
Throw that shit like Peyton
Throw that shit like Peyton
Hurry up, I got these other niggas waiting
