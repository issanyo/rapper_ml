[Intro-Skooly]
Yeah, I'm trippin' on em
They trippin' on me
I'm trippin' on em

[Verse 1-Skooly]
Oh
Its dead people in my basement
Get out of line, meet the people in my basement
I'm from where they dyin', and you won't find a way to make it
I'm involved with the Haitians, my neighbor's a racist
600 [?] benz, watch em hop out
600 dolls, fine friends, watch em cock out
They say I be puttin in too much work and I won't clock out
In the classroom knocked out, making bitches drop out

[Bridge-Skooly]
Yeah, I'm trippin' on em
They trippin' on me
I'm sippin' on em
Them bitches licking on me

[Hook-Skooly]
Louis shoe strings got me trippin' on em
And if them niggas trippin' we gone lift up on em
And if them bitches fine get to clippin on em
My styrofoam dirty, I'm sippin' on it
And it ain't hard to tell that we flexing on em
And shit get hard as hell when the techs up on em
Even when I'm by myself don't trip up on em
That four-fifth is on em

[Verse 2-Skooly]
Boy you gotta, put your eyes on your mouth and nigga watch what you say
This shit I'm sipping got me tripping, leaned until the next day
(Let's go, yeah)
And it take a lot to get this fly, a lotta weed to get this high
Raise my hand and touch the sky (I'm flexin, grrrrr)
No muscles, I'm a rapper, slash hustler
Like the hair on your head my nigga I'm so above ya (We on top)
These niggas underpaid and still overrated
While us, we overpaid, and still underrated
They hate it

[Hook-Skooly]
Louis shoe strings got me trippin' on em
And if them niggas trippin' we gone lift up on em
And if them bitches fine get to clippin on em
My styrofoam dirty, I'm sippin' on it
And it ain't hard to tell that we flexing on em
And shit get hard as hell when the techs up on em
Even when I'm by myself don't trip up on em
That four-fifth is on em

[Verse 3-Juicy J]
I got big knots, these niggas tripping
Ciga' and a double cup, I'm smoking and I'm sipping
Money out the ass, you get money out the ass (They shaking)
Bitch I'm still spending money from the past (oooh)
Balling like I'm Nash, on they ass like a rash
And I'm staying with the heat, you can call me Flash
Give me a cigar, bitch you smoking trash
Bitches throwing ass, cutting up like a gash
Clean cup (mhmm) but its really dirty (mhmm)
Dope boy change (ching ching). It cost a birdy
They watching me, my life went Louis
It runs in my family, guy, call me Stewie

[Hook-Skooly]
Louis shoe strings got me trippin' on em
And if them niggas trippin' we gone lift up on em
And if them bitches fine get to clippin on em
My styrofoam dirty, I'm sippin' on it
And it ain't hard to tell that we flexing on em
And shit get hard as hell when the techs up on em
Even when I'm by myself don't trip up on em
That four-fifth is on em, we trippin' on em
