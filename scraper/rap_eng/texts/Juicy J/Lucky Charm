[Hook: Juicy J]
She my good luck, she must be my lucky charm
When she not around, got me blowin' her up, like she a bomb
I wrap her in my arms
And we touch tongues
Lil momma real bad, but she don't mean no harm
She my lucky charm
She my lucky charm
I keep her by my side, cause she my lucky charm
She my lucky charm
She my lucky charm
She ride when it's time to ride, she my lucky charm

[Verse 1: Juciy J]
I think I finally got me one, this time around
I'm really feeling her, she might make me settle down
I had to make a move, I ain't talking furniture
She too bad, I'mma have to punish her
She short and red remind me of a dynamite
If looks could kill somebody gone die tonight
She like to get tipsy plus she like to smoke too
Been looking for this type of chick I can't believe that it's true
She got her own money, so she don't need mine
But I share it with her cause what's hers is mine
She don't do no arguin'
She don't do no fussin'
I think I'm bout to pop the question

[Hook: Juicy J]
She my good luck, she must be my lucky charm
When she not around, got me blowin' her up, like she a bomb
I wrap her in my arms
And we touch tongues
Lil momma real bad, but she don't mean no harm
She my lucky charm
She my lucky charm
I keep her by my side, cause she my lucky charm
She my lucky charm
She my lucky charm
She ride when it's time to ride, she my lucky charm
