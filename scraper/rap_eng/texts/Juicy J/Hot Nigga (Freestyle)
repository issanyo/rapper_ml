[Verse]
Juicy J a monster Talyor Gang sponsor
Took your girlfriend about to fuck her in her tonsils
Yellow momma wetter than a lake in her jeans
And she be wide awake and I still sell that bitch her dream
No Hollywood divorce you can't hit me for half
No prenup just a nut I just want to smash
Baby I just wanna hit it and get rid of your ass
I'm not giving it to my feelings I'm too busy getting cash
Double cup of lean-monade thats that Justin Bieber
And these shoes that I got on they cost more than a KIA
Every time I sign in cursive thats to add another zero
Fuck niggas know I keep that metal on me like Magneto
I hear this money talking my money machine stunna
All these rocks up on my watch I think my jeweler do construction
That bullshit you selling my nigga we ain't buying
We don't do that chatta bitch we strictly lifting that iron
Banana clip, longer than a video on vine
All these fucking guns like we saving Private Ryan
Your nigga pulled up on bikes
Little nigga about to earn his stripes
It might cost him his freedom but it gon' cost you your life
It's cold out here thats right niggas don't fight
Niggas gone off that weed niggas gone off that white
They like fuck it nothing to lose they just bust it on sight
I'm just looking out for you my nigga watch that shit you write
Watch that shit you write
I'm just looking out for you my nigga watch that shit you write
Watch that shit you write
I'm just looking out for you my nigga watch that shit you write
