[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Now I'm gon' tell you bout this pimpin'
What I'm ridin' down the strip in
Bentley rolls on these hoes
Couple a months a nigga be flippin
And you always see me glistenin
Window down bumpin system
Some of these cowards out here hatin
Keep on hatin cause I ain't finished
Just a nigga from the hood
Tryin to keep it to the good
Where them gangs run the street
And they push them Cadillac woods
And them fellas on parole
Wan to keep they pockets swole
But we gotta trust in GOD
He the one to save our soul
From these crooked ass cops
That be rollin down our block mane
Tryin to flip dis change
But they fuckin up my stock mane
Baby need sum shoes
And my broad needs a weave
But I can't work no job
So I'm out hurr smokin weed
And I gotta keep on hustlin
Cause a nigga gotta eat
You can find me at the candy lady
Slangin packs of P
Minimum wage $5.50
And they wonderin why we deal
Why niggas always stressin
Drinkin liquor
Poppin pill
