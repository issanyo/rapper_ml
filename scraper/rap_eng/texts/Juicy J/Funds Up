Stop chasin' that hoe, let her go

[Hook: Juicy J]
Stop chasin' that hoe, let her go, get your funds up
Stop chasin' a glow, get some doe
Get your funds up (get your funds up)
Can't do no show for the low
Get your funds up (get your funds up)
Hell-naw, can't go, is you slow?
Get your funds up (get your funds up)
Stop chasin' that hoe, let her go, get your funds up
Stop chasin' a glow, get some doe
Get your funds up (get your funds up)
Can't do no show for the low
Get your funds up (get your funds up)
Hell-naw, can't go, is you slow?
Get your funds up (get your funds up)

[Verse 1]
You gotta do better, get your shit together, you out here wastin' your time
Stop stunnin', that hoe, she don't care but nothin' but doe, what the fuck is you blind?
Only reason that you on her mind, she hittin' your line it's 'cause you signed
That bitch ain't holdin' you down, she breakin' you down, just pay attention to the sign
You gotta get to it, hard times, get through it
Get a check, just do it, bullshit, see through it
You better pray 'bout it, you better not play 'bout it
Fuck anybody who got somethin' say 'bout it
Stack you some money and stun on these lil niggas
Don't fall in love with none of these lil bitches
Just be that nigga, don't worry 'bout no misses
Stick to the mission and focus on your riches

[Hook]
Stop chasin' that hoe, let her go, get your funds up
Stop chasin' a glow, get some doe
Get your funds up (get your funds up)
Can't do no show for the low
Get your funds up (get your funds up)
Hell-naw, can't go, is you slow?
Get your funds up (get your funds up)
Stop chasin' that hoe, let her go, get your funds up
Stop chasin' a glow, get some doe
Get your funds up (get your funds up)
Can't do no show for the low
Get your funds up (get your funds up)
Hell-naw, can't go, is you slow?
Get your funds up (get your funds up)
Turn up

[Verse 2]
Niggas be signing them deals, they'll be fucked up
No money in they account, tryna come up
These bitches ratchet, they Instagram hoes
You can prolly hit that bitch for the low
You better stop chasin' pussy and get you some money
'Cause that's what's gon' keep bitches comin', I'm not a dummy
Even when I don't feel like it, nobody else count it for me
Bitches gon' come with the money, but money don't come with the bitches
Niggas gon' act like your homie, yeah that shit gon' come with the riches
You better hit you a lick, tryna flip it, I'm on a mission
Every day I need to make me a ticket, I'm not religious
But it's Monday out here and I'm a witness
All you gotta do is get up and get it

[Outro]
Get that bag nigga
Stop wastin' your time mane
This pussies goin' be here
Feed your family nigga
Stop chasin' that hoe
