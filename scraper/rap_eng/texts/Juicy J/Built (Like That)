[Intro: Juicy J]
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, ridin' spinners, they don't stop
Niggas ain't built like that

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Fall through SoHo House, you don't know none' 'bout that
Bought my mama a house, show my love like that
Black card don't max out, Rich Homie Quan, I flex
Bond my niggas out, you niggas ain't built like that
Blessin' gon' come right back, you niggas ain't real like that
In the big body sittin' in the back, you niggas just hear about that
Spend the  money, get it right back, yeah, I be in the field like that
Run off, don't come back, you might get killed like that

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I got stripes, like Off-White, got that Saint Laurent
LV shades, on my face, you can't see my eyes
I'm at Diddy's house, drinkin' straight Ciroc
Neiman Marcus, run through bargains, fuck my money up
Met this bitch, her ass is perfect, stored her name as Buns
Hit her once and eject her just like they did LeBron
Don't look like she from Colombia, I don't wanna fuck
I just stay down with that shit and now my numbers up
I know for a fact, niggas ain't built like that
Invest in myself, I can make a mil like that
I can see you chasin' that clout, should've took a whole 'nother route
She sleep with it in her mouth, something you don't know none' 'bout

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Fall through SoHo House, you don't know none' 'bout that
Bought my mama a house, show my love like that
Black card don't max out, Rich Homie Quan, I flex
Bond my niggas out, you niggas ain't built like that
Blessin' gon' come right back, you niggas ain't real like that
In the big body sittin' in the back, you niggas just hear about that
Spend the  money, get it right back, yeah, I be in the field like that
Run off, don't come back, you might get killed like that

[Verse 2: YKOM]
Yo, fall through SoHo House
Yeah I pull up like that
The big body and it's matte black
You niggas can't get like that
I guess I be killing another league
Think he better, he smokin' a different weed
I'm the king and there can't be no in-between
Keep on talking, that money gon' intervene
Pull up with a new bitch, the new coupe came with the stick
I got the whole squad gettin' hit, and we in LV gettin' lit
I learned not to fuck with them better hoes
Leave the dealer and go cop another Rolls
More face on me, and you know it's real
They gon' hate on the boss, 'cause niggas is soft like that
And I'll break you off like that
Keep on asking the cost when business involved, and niggas get paused like that
Put it in they face, just to see these bitches chase
I've been running up a pace, flowers in the vase
Never nice with the case, and these niggas in the way
But they'll be okay

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Fall through SoHo House, you don't know none' 'bout that
Bought my mama a house, show my love like that
Black card don't max out, Rich Homie Quan, I flex
Bond my niggas out, you niggas ain't built like that
Blessin' gon' come right back, you niggas ain't real like that
In the big body sittin' in the back, you niggas just hear about that
Spend the  money, get it right back, yeah, I be in the field like that
Run off, don't come back, you might get killed like that

[Outro: Juicy J]
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they rollin'
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they rollin'
