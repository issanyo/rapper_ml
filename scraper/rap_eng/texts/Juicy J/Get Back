[Intro: Slim Jxmmi]
Yeah
Need that... ooo, ayy
Ayy, ayy
Uh, uh, uh, uh, whoa

[Pre-Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
Big blunts make you lean back (Fat Joe)
House in the hills, I need that (need that)
I don't need your love, you can keep that (keep that)
Just touched down, where the weed at?
Nigga this here, that get back
Stopped poppin' Xans and I relapsed
Dip dip with your hoe, I'ma be back
Dip dip with your hoe, I'ma be back

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
Nigga this here, that get back
How you still broke? I don't get that
Remember them hoes ain't want that?
Now they prayin' that a nigga come hit that
Now they prayin' that a nigga come hit that
Nigga this here, that get back
Nigga this here, that get back

[Verse 1: Slim Jxmmi]
Just touched down where my bros at
Better yet, where the hoes at?
Word on the street, Ima chick mag
Bald head bitch, Amber Rose swag
I don't ask the price when I pop tags
Leanin' got jet lag
I can't go out sad
All the niggas 'round me got they own bag
Got a bitch in every city
These hoes ain't nothin' when you winnin' (nothin')
I can do the Gucci, I can do the Fendi
I can do the 'Rari, I can do the Bentley
If a hater wanna stunt, I'm with it (let's get it)
If a hater wanna stunt, I'm with it (let's get it)
Popped a bar before I came, I'm trippin'
Y'all cuffin' these hoes, I'm different

[Pre-Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
Big blunts make you lean back (Fat Joe)
House in the hills, I need that (need that)
I don't need your love, you can keep that (keep that)
Just touched down, where the weed at?
Nigga this here, that get back
Stopped poppin' Xans and I relapsed
Dip dip with your hoe, I'ma be back
Dip dip with your hoe, I'ma be back

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
Nigga this here, that get back
How you still broke? I don't get that
Remember them hoes ain't want that?
Now they prayin' that a nigga come hit that
Now they prayin' that a nigga come hit that
Nigga this here, that get back
Nigga this here, that get back

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I'm so dope, she relapse
I hang up, she call me back
I don't want your love, you can keep that
Bitch got me twisted, Keith Sweat
Gimme that check, I need that
Gimme that neck, I need that
If it ain't about that, you can lean back
Heard what I said, I mean that
This that get back
I'm in the back of the Mulsanne kick back
Big blunts, full of that
Green suicide, bitch hit that
Came up, from the bottom
Now a nigga on top with big racks
Louis this, Gucci that
When you a rich nigga, you can mismatch
Most these niggas that flex be broke, I don't understand, I don't get that
All on the 'Gram, showin' niggas what you toting 'til a nigga come through and blow your shit back
One shot to the dome, brains on the ground where your feed at
{Gunshot}
I'm tryna get paid, fuck that beef, you can keep that

[Pre-Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
Big blunts make you lean back (Fat Joe)
House in the hills, I need that (need that)
I don't need your love, you can keep that (keep that)
Just touched down, where the weed at?
Nigga this here, that get back
Stop poppin' Xans and I relapsed
Dip dip with your hoe, I'ma be back
Dip dip with your hoe, I'ma be back

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
Nigga this here, that get back
How you still broke? I don't get that
Remember them hoes ain't want that?
Now they prayin' that a nigga come hit that
Now they prayin' that a nigga come hit that
Nigga this here, that get back
Nigga this here, that get back

[Verse 3: T-Shyne]
Lil' ass nigga better get back (get back)
If you ain't broke nigga, bet that (back that)
Yeah, I trap, I'm with that (with that)
'Bout to move a pound through the lift app (Skrrrrt)
Think about it all when I sit back
The drank got me gone when I sip that
If I'm with a bitch, bet I hit that
If she fuck me good, might tip that
I got your bitch on my phone, she told she can't leave me 'lone
Give me head while I finish a song
Pussy dead, I just beat it for fun
I just spent your whole rent on my lungs
Gettin' money, let's count up the funds
You so broke, you got counterfeit ones
You don't gotta lie to me son
The Rollie Presidential, like Sinbad
I just got off the PJ, I'm jet lagged
I'm pushin' a foreign car (Skrrrt)
It's me and some pornstars, I got 'em all on bars
What else could I want for?

[Pre-Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
Big blunts make you lean back (Fat Joe)
House in the hills, I need that (need that)
I don't need your love, you can keep that (keep that)
Just touched down, where the weed at?
Nigga this here, that get back
Stop poppin' Xans and I relapsed
Dip dip with your hoe, I'ma be back
Dip dip with your hoe, I'ma be back

[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]
Nigga this here, that get back
How you still broke? I don't get that
Remember them hoes ain't want that?
Now they prayin' that a nigga come hit that
Now they prayin' that a nigga come hit that
Nigga this here, that get back
Nigga this here, that get back
