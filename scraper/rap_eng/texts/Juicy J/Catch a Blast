[Hook]
Step into this mass
And you gon' catch a blast
Step into this mass
And you gon' catch a blast
Step into this mass
And you gon' catch a blast
Step into this mass
And you gon' catch a blast

[Verse 1: T-Rock]
We keep contact with coffin concealers
Heavy narcotic dealers
Who confiscated spirits
Leaving carcasses as memorabilia
That's when I clutch your remainders of cash
After receiving the papers of passion
Insanity
Guess that's my simple out-thinking it
Caught no remorse that I felt in the past
Leaving conceited niggas
Face Guard
Entrapped a man and the case was
Delivering eternal residences
In lyrical graveyards
Niggas play hard
I'm equipped with a safeguard
And admit that the danger
Not a regret
A resistant in dominating legion
That's thought to deliver those souls
Which tried to presented you
Triple pain
For your resistful blaims
Now you a shriveled blade
Stuck in the dungeons of the abyssful flames
Lyrical clips so aim
Producing blood-red tonics
Exorcising demonic
My click is thicker than Islamics
With poetry, possess game
I educate sickness, I meditate victory
And how my fame will escalate swiftly
If correct moves were made with valid timing
Every individual with traits of poverty
Would believe thats my dollars climbing

[Hook]
Step into this mass
And you gon' catch a blast
Step into this mass
And you gon' catch a blast
Step into this mass
And you gon' catch a blast
Step into this mass
And you gon' catch a blast

[Verse 2: M-Child]
Mackin' Child is who I be
Never be facing this rector
Controlling the inside our minds
Reaching my point in my destiny
Where it is said
If I went through my bloodlines
So come with me I come with you
Are you coming into my place
Ain't no time for fucking around
I'm bound to stomp a hole in your face
Playa-hater
Some dummies went into my kitchen
And rolled up a blunt
I catch him
Now come take a puff of this shit
You could really blaze it like the sun
My nigga pizz-off
He did not believe I could be part of the
Six's
When I caught the green leprechaun
You better believe that was 1 of my wishes
If you niggas don't know you ain't heard
I'm more than that nigga that is ready for
Combat
I'd watch my step if I were you
When I'm coming there's no time to react
Better have your whole masterplan set
And I bet it won't work
Cause I already figured you
Loading up the shit
Slip a mask on my face
Nine in my pocket to do what I came to do
We ridin' the streets
With your punk-ass in the backseat
The system is booming so niggas
Cannot hear your ass get put to sleep
When you niggas be thinking
That I am your friend
And you think you can bite our style
Chop goes your body half into the mist
When you fuckin' with Murderer Child...
