[Intro: DatPiff Tag]
DatPiff.com, world premiere

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Kick back, get my dick sucked by a thick slut
Kick back, rollin' this weed up, gettin' lit as fuck
Kick back, watchin' this money stack, made a hunnit' racks
Kick back, you just knick knack, I'm big stacks
Kick back, I'm in Fifth Saks, I mean Saks Fifth
Kick back, get me this and that, give me less lip
Kick back, I don't work for free, I got what you need
Kick back, she won't come for you, I bet she come for me

[Verse 1]
Kick back, gettin' head on the first date
Gotta make the right moves on the first play
I know what she wanna do in the first place
I be puttin' in work, she the workplace
I be smokin' OG, sippin' OJ
Free Big Meech when they free OJ
Got a bankroll bigger than your whole face
So fresh probably lookin' like a dope case
Use to buy the whole wall, buy the whole place
I don't care if you don't like it, you got no taste
You can get it for the low, can't get it for the free, nigga ain't know how, ain't no way
You the type of nigga that would fuck a bitch life up, make a bitch wanna relocate
I'm the type that would change a bitch life on the first date, kick back, feet up, first place

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Kick back, get my dick sucked by a thick slut
Kick back, rollin' this weed up, gettin' lit as fuck
Kick back, watchin' this money stack, made a hunnit' racks
Kick back, you just knick knack, I'm big stacks
Kick back, I'm in Fifth Saks, I mean Saks Fifth
Kick back, get me this and that, give me less lip
Kick back, I don't work for free, I got what you need
Kick back, she won't come for you, I bet she come for me
