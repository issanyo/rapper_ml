[Intro]
Hot as hell

[Chorus]
I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell), I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell)
I'm hot as hell on these streets, I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell)
I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell), I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell)
I'm hot as hell on these beats, I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell)
I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell), I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell)
My youngin' cashing off a brick, she hot as hell (she hot as hell)
He put extensions on the stick, he hot as hell (he hot as hell)
I put extensions on my bitch, she hot as hell (she hot as hell)
I'm hot as hell

[Verse 1]
Roll up and get stoned (yeah)
Check out my new stones (yeah)
I'm hot, my wrist cold (yeah)
Don't blink, your bitch gone (yeah)
You been gone for a minute, yeah, bitch I'm still on (yeah)
Still clappin' them ratchets (yeah), still totin'' big chrome
New this, new that
Run it up off back
You're runnin' off with the pack
We runnin' up with the MAC *gunshot*
Real niggas don't fall off, real niggas fall back
Don't fall through my hood, fuck around and get jacked
Counting up by the racks, settin' traps for the rats
She told me "Wait for the pussy," I ain't never called back
I ain't tryin' to catch feelings, I ain't into all that
I'm just tryin' to catch a nigga slippin', tell him "Give me all that"

[Chorus]
I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell), I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell)
I'm hot as hell on these streets, I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell)
I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell), I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell)
I'm hot as hell on these beats, I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell)
I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell), I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell)
My youngin' cashing off a brick, she hot as hell (she hot as hell)
He put extensions on the stick, he hot as hell (he hot as hell)
I put extensions on my bitch, she hot as hell (she hot as hell)
I'm hot as hell

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I'm hot like fish grease
Stack my bread like six feast
I came up with three 6
Put my niggas on like Big Meech
I wake up and get to it
For that check I just do it
I'm on top, get used to it
You're not hot, your bitch knew it
I fucked all these hoes
Made a couple mill' off these shows
I'm a wild boy like Steve-O
Pop one, might pop three mo'
Hit a couple free coats
Nigga, that's free throw
I go Marshawn, nigga, that's beast mode
Pipe down, boy, I know you ain't 'bout it
Hunnid' thousand, boy, I know you can't count it
Hunnid' rounds, like fuck your vest
Defining rich, nigga fuck your fresh
Throwing G's for the alligator, you be goin' broke tryna match my fresh
Last year you was a man, homie, why the fuck you goin' out like that?

[Chorus]
I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell), I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell)
I'm hot as hell on these streets, I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell)
I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell), I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell)
I'm hot as hell on these beats, I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell)
I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell), I'm hot as hell (I'm hot as hell)
My youngin' cashing off a brick, she hot as hell (she hot as hell)
He put extensions on the stick, he hot as hell (he hot as hell)
I put extensions on my bitch, she hot as hell (she hot as hell)
I'm hot as hell

[Outro]
Mafia, mafia, mafia, mafia, mafia
I'm hot as hell
Mafia, mafia, mafia, mafia, mafia
