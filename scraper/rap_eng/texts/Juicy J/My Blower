[Intro: Future & Juicy J]
Esco, Hold up, I got you mane
It's gettin technical, it's gettin technical, I can tell you that
Ayy

[Hook: Future]
Forty dollars for 3 grams, told my weed man, roll up
Bitch better know who I am (who doe?) told my lean man, po' up (po')
Already worked out a deal (yeah) ain't tryna go no lower (no)
Lil' homie need to calm down, chill (uh huh), good thing I had my blower (slick, slick)
I'm always chasin' these mills, cause I used to sleep on the floor (mhmm)
I know you see me in all this gear, still I wanna have more
Been fuckin this hoe for years, she ain't tell me this pussy was yours

She ain't tell me this pussy was yours

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
(Ayy) I just popped my hood (hood) and I can't find my motor (motor)
I walked in the bank (bank) like bitch never mind my odor (my odor)
That's grade A loud I'm blowin (mhmm) I just put my wrist out, it's snowin (snowin)
Its a baby AR I'm totin' (totin'), nigga try me right now, I'mma show him
Been getting paid since the percolator, you ain't real you a impersonator (nigga)
I got money so damn old that it ain't even in circulate (yeah)
Hook your ass to a respirator, I was only tryna help you haters
Send my goons to assassinate you, my joint so long I use wrapping paper
Lit, I'm a stoner, met your girl at the club I'mma bone her
You can have that hoe right back, I don't want that bitch, she a loaner
Used to be hanging on the corner, now a nigga live on the Billboard
I got more money than I can spend, and a team full of niggas thatâ€™ll kill for it

Lil' nigga need to go chill, good thing I had my blower

[Verse 2: Future]
Sixteen zips in the seal, twenty-five hundred tomorrow
Pushin up in a new whip, got wings all on my doors
Fuckin off in Chanel, I done bought the Hermes store up
Rollin' up straight out the zip (smoke) OG all in my bud (kush)
Made my hoe switch ships, bitch you know I'm the plug
Actavis, Actavis, Actavis, bitch gotta keep two cups
Mix it up till it turn pink, now about the time we po' up (po' up)
I done been up for a week, now I feel like I'm about to throw up
Fuck around hit my cup (cup) you ain't gon' do nothin but nod (pint)
Ran up on a whole lotta millions (millions) Super done beat those odds (odds)
Hang around a lot of retards, gotta keep the hammer on guard
I'm gonna make it hard for you eat, cause most of you niggas y'all frauds
