[Intro]
Get your money, get your money
Get your money, get your money
Get your money, get your money
Get your money, get your money

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Say you need some extra cash to pay for college with
And it just so happens I got a lot of it
Spin around the pole while you're doing splits
By the end of the night might earn you a scholarship
You a college chick, you a college chick
Keep twerking baby, might earn you a scholarship
You a college chick, you a college chick
Keep twerking baby, might earn you a scholarship
100 dollars, 100 dollars, 100 dollars, trick
100 dollars, 100 dollars, 100 dollars, trick
You a college chick, you a college chick
By the end of the night might earn you a scholarship

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Clap that ass, just like the clapper
All these bands now these bitches wanna fuck with rappers
I got my Ghost outside, I call it Casper
Ain't no nigga fly as Juicy J, ask NASA
Show me some, I might owe you some
Them bands waitin' and I know you want 'em
I'm tryna pay your student loans
Fuck your boyfriend, I don't want your number
Let me get that becky while I'm rollin' up
Send my watch back to my jeweler, it ain't cold enough
Just a bunch of bad college chicks in the W with no clothes on
Trippy cup in my hand in the bathtub with my robe on
Tell all your girlfriends that I'm breakin' bread and down to fuck
One night, fuck a wife, trippy niggas never cuff

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Say you need some extra cash to pay for college with
And it just so happens I got a lot of it
Spin around the pole while you're doing splits
By the end of the night might earn you a scholarship
You a college chick, you a college chick
Keep twerking baby, might earn you a scholarship
You a college chick, you a college chick
Keep twerking baby, might earn you a scholarship
100 dollars, 100 dollars, 100 dollars, trick
100 dollars, 100 dollars, 100 dollars, trick
You a college chick, you a college chick
By the end of the night might earn you a scholarship

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Well fuck her master, she got her bachelor
So she only fucking rappers, she tired of Kappas
And she only shake for backups, so shake it faster
It gets better every chapter, spit that Project Patta
(She call me master!)
Money, money, money while she grindin' on the pole
Dollar for a show but don't nobody gotta know
(Get it, get it off the floor)
She shakin' it like she strippin'
She only representin' for her bitches out in Memphis
Hol' up, hol' up wait a minute, I just came to my senses
I'm trippin' if I'm trickin' if I'm paying your tuition
Cause you know a couple principles or pals in your division
Pay attention, how I'm livin', bet you hate it like detention
Motherfucker...

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Say you need some extra cash to pay for college with
And it just so happens I got a lot of it
Spin around the pole while you're doing splits
By the end of the night might earn you a scholarship
You a college chick, you a college chick
Keep twerking baby, might earn you a scholarship
You a college chick, you a college chick
Keep twerking baby, might earn you a scholarship
100 dollars, 100 dollars, 100 dollars, trick
100 dollars, 100 dollars, 100 dollars, trick
You a college chick, you a college chick
By the end of the night might earn you a scholarship

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
You know what it is shawty, rubber band game
DJ say they out of 1's, they don't mean a damn thang
Throwing 5's 10's 20's, catch a 50 if you lucky
Might just get this whole nut, if you ride me like a huffy
Baby I'm so excited, how about we do it in private
Come get hooked on the juice, I'm so doge you should try it
Let me pay for your class, let me cover your books
Honey this stack in my pocket is probably thinking its a book
This a millionaire dollar team, you should come and join
You can get a pimp house at the trunk fuck a don
You know top notch Gs get the most, not the lesser
Come and fuck with Juicy J, get more than your professor

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Say you need some extra cash to pay for college with
And it just so happens I got a lot of it
Spin around the pole while you're doing splits
By the end of the night might earn you a scholarship
You a college chick, you a college chick
Keep twerking baby, might earn you a scholarship
You a college chick, you a college chick
Keep twerking baby, might earn you a scholarship
100 dollars, 100 dollars, 100 dollars, trick
100 dollars, 100 dollars, 100 dollars, trick
You a college chick, you a college chick
By the end of the night might earn you a scholarship
