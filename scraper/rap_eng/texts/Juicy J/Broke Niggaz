[Chorus: Juicy J]
No more broke niggas, no more broke niggas
Never again I can't fuck with no more broke niggas
No more broke bitches, no more broke bitches
Never again I can't fuck with no more broke bitches
I just broke niggas, I just broke niggas
Nigga tried to run up on me, I just broke niggas
I just broke bitches, I just broke bitches
I can never let them play me, I just broke bitches

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Now open your mouth and just suck on this
Bitch, even a nympho can't fuck with this, yeah
So much ice I might need me another wrist, yeah
Even your bitch fell in love with this, nigga
On my dick, I might need me another job
In the street, you should know you should keep a chop
Put in work so I know I should keep a clock, yeah
I can't trust them I know that they fuck with cops
I can't trust them, I know that they fuck with ops
I can't trust them, I know that they sneak and plot, yeah
Who the fuck taught you, little niggas, how to rob?
If you broke you should go and get you a job
So you end up missin', that's the mafia
Yeah if I catch you creepin', you should pray to God
Got them hungry killers waitin' in the yard
They gon' leave you up stankin' up in your garage

[Chorus: Juicy J]
No more broke niggas, no more broke niggas
Never again I can't fuck with no more broke niggas
No more broke bitches, no more broke bitches
Never again I can't fuck with no more broke bitches
I just broke niggas, I just broke niggas
Nigga tried to run up on me, I just broke niggas
I just broke bitches, I just broke bitches
I can never let them play me, I just broke bitches

[Pre-Verse: Juicy J]
Mafia! Mafia! Mafia!
Mafia! Mafia! Mafia!
Y-K-O-M

[Verse 2: YKOM]
Yo' I'm 'bout to go make me a movie
Five-k a verse since I linked up with Juicy
Rockstar like I hang out with Uzi
A mill on the kid and I came here to prove it
Tay Keith producer, you know that he slappin'
I go Sammy Sosa then I back to back it
Ain't gotta ask boy, you know how I'm packin'
Don't let me get in my zone, [?] I've been goin' rocky
Name one poppin', never could cop it
Swervin' in the lane, bitch I'm Ricky Bobby
[?], hit him in his body
Iâ€™ve been coast, screamin' fuck the hoes
Memphis in the game, I should strike a pose
Mofaces chain, damn that boy cold
Put me in the game, twenty-k a show, no more broke

[Chorus: Juicy J]
No more broke niggas, no more broke niggas
Never again I can't fuck with no more broke niggas
No more broke bitches, no more broke bitches
Never again I can't fuck with no more broke bitches
I just broke niggas, I just broke niggas
Nigga tried to run up on me, I just broke niggas
I just broke bitches, I just broke bitches
I can never let them play me, I just broke bitches

[Outro: Juicy J]
Mafia! Mafia! Mafia!
Mafia! Mafia! Mafia!
