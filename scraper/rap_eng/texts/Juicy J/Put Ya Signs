[Hook:] x2
Put ya sign in his face, gang sign in his face
Put ya sign in his face, gang sign in his face
Make them niggas fight, what make them hoes fight
Make them niggas fight, what make them hoes fight

[Gangsta Boo]
If you bitches ain't scared put a bitch right to the floor
Tell her she belong below under shoes where roaches go
Ho I'm ready if you ready tell me what you wanna do
To the lovely Gangsta Boo, buck as fuck I thought you knew
Put my sign up in ya face
Leave ya stape without a trace
You ain't buck cause bitch I saw ya stankin' ass yesterday
Tuck ya chain ho ya weave cause I'm comin' in the crowd boy
With niggas and I'm out slammin' bitches to the ground

[Lord Infamous]
I see ya from the stage ya angry face is fighting in the corner
Full of marijuana niggas in the middle in a trauma
While they throwin' 'bo's they snatchin' hoes that stuck in a coma
Any thick lil' fine bitch come on through a nigga all up on her
Some trick done got mad and ran to the wagon and grabbed a 12 gauge pump
Probably full of that numby numb that coke and rum and gettin' dumb
Cars are barrelin' through the nigga shootin' runnin' to the Rover
Niggas catchin' the heat from slugs
Negroes gettin' trampled over

[Hook x 2]

[Juicy J]
Now I got you bitches hot
Platinum out and on the spot
Mad because they take your cell
So they stop at slangin' rocks
Bring yo ass to North Memphis
Killas hang and niggas pimpin'
Playas on them cards flippin'
Choppin dope up in the kitchen
And I always keep it real
Way before a record deal
So my nigga don't hate on me cause Juicy J be gettin his bills
Clean that mug from off ya face unless you want a casket case
Nigga fuck what ya end, who ya clean, and fuck ya friend

[DJ Paul]
Nigga you claimin set, throwin', showin' signs
You ain't no one look inside your face is plain as day
Another ho is showin'
Bitch I'm down with the same game you claim but I will fuck you up
Ho it ain't the same off in them flames I don't give a fuck
Put some in your liver you so trill in the studio
Nigga all but the liver watch you run like bitch was stealers that I let you
Know
Packing automatics full of that static that you stressin' for
Actin' like you want some but it seems you scared to go

[Hook]

[Koopsta Knicca]
Hey don't call me for sweet songs
Ain't no ?
Ain't no funky smilin' faces
Ain't no grins up on this man
It's the ? that keeps me cool
Social security breaking news
Shit could fight up all night with mo henny wait that's how I (breath)
Do you feel it? Is it rare?
Smack that bitch up with that chair
When you see me over there
Raise your hands up in the air
Cause bitch this ain't no Rosewood
Nigga take another round
Slipped up, chopped up, fucked, lights out

[Crunchy Black]
Claim where I claim, hang where I hang
Burn where I burn, nigga ain't no thing
Do what I do, hanging with my crew
(What, what, what, what) nigga I thought you knew
Ain't no hood, throwin' our sets
Me fuckin' more nigga no disrespect
Get out our way, gun will spray
Easy come nigga any day

[Hook until fade]
