[Hook - Juicy J]
You got guns, that don't make you a killa nigga
I know you a pussy bro, I know you won't kill a nigga
Convicted felons, yeah I hang with the killas nigga
And we ain't stopping: they gotta kill us nigga

[Verse 1 - Juicy J]
I got goons like the President
That will blow up your residence
I don't give a god damn, bitch
I'mma pull a chopper real quick
Thatâ€™s not a standing ovation: that's gun claps
From a fully-automatic Mack 11 strap
You want to go to war? A suicide mission
You better off killing yourself before you come up missing

[Hook - Juicy J]
You got guns, that don't make you a killa nigga
I know you a pussy bro, I know you won't kill a nigga
Convicted felons, yeah I hang with the killas nigga
And we ain't stopping: they gotta kill us nigga

[Verse 2 - Juicy J]
You a rookie I'm a seasoned vet: nigga I be stuntin
Wake up early all I see is checks: nigga I get money
My goons out to get it witchya, play with my paper
Pray to God you get rescued: no one can save you
In the club with our thumbs up, north!
If you not representing what you come for, boy
We rolling 50 deep in the VIP
Congratulations: now you finally get to meet a G
Now your girl looking at me like a piece of meat
I can see it in her eye: she wanna leave with me
Up to my suite. Now you're standing with your mug on
Well look my nigga: don't get mad, go on, get some money

[Hook - Juicy J]
You got guns, that don't make you a killa nigga
I know you a pussy bro, I know you won't kill a nigga
Convicted felons, yeah I hang with the killas nigga
And we ain't stopping: they gotta kill us nigga
