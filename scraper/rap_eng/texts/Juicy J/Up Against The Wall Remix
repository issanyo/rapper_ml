(Intro)
Yo Mike D you crazy for this remix fool
Yea, J Round, whats happenin man?
Look

(Verse)
Shorty fine fine, brown eyes skin caramel
Long hair, dont care, ass fat as hell
Shorty bad ass fuck, ass fat ass fuck
Superfine, tatted up, and she draggin hours uh
She a freak in the sheets but on the street she casual
And she start to hold round, made her back it back
She got my back against the wall like I cant trust nobody
Back it up, back it up, back it up beep beep
Can I get you to follow me after the club? Tweet me

(Pre-Hook)
Damn you lookin good, man shortys so fly
If I pull you on the dance floor
Baby dont be actin shy
Girl I love the way you move
And Im feelin the way you grindin
I will pull you little closer
And grab your waist from behind
She backin me up slowly
Putting it on me like she know me
You say youd be the baddest
Babbay come over and show me

(Hook)
She got me up against the wall
She got me up against the wall
She got me up against the wall
She got me up against the wall
Oh yea, up against the wall
She got me up against the wall
She got me up against the wall

(Verse)
Yea, there she go slidin on a pole, they call a Porsche
Got ass like a horse and she bring it back like the source
She said she wanna fuck in my new Benz
I told er thats okay if she brought 2 friends
I like me some races like I do my liquor
Henny plus a Bombay and some Dissativa
Twitter got me trending cuz niggas see me spendin
Her body like Serena, try to hit it like tennis
They fuckin in the club like tabu
And I just put er on the lean cuz Im high too
Back to the crib then boom pussy on deck
Tell shorty to make that ass bounce like a bad chick

(Pre-Hook)
Damn you lookin good, man shortys so fly
If I pull you on the dance floor
Baby dont be actin shy
Girl I love the way you move
And Im feelin the way you grindin
I will pull you little closer
And grab your waist from behind
She backin me up slowly
Putting it on me like she know me
You say youd be the baddest
Babbay come over and show me

(Hook)
She got me up against the wall
She got me up against the wall
She got me up against the wall
She got me up against the wall
Oh yea, up against the wall
She got me up against the wall
She got me up against the wall
She got me up against the

(Interlude x2)
Then we go hard, then we wont stop
You be on Patron I be on Saroc
Let me work the middle baby show me what you got
Let me, let me work the middle baby, show me what you got

(Outro)
