[Verse 1]
Man we deep off in recession and i'm still out here stuntin'
Diamonds out down to the toe, I got bling off in my buttons
I got hoes that be fuckin', I got powder with no cuttin
I got methamphetamine that keeps the trap bouncin' and yappin'
I got houses by the lake, it's great, they call me Mr. shake and bake
A brand new whip on 28's, with burgundy seats and candy paint
A duffle bag that'll make you faint thats full of cash and purple drank, a barney blunt a purple stank to try to keep away the hate away
I'm poppin' bottles, popping collars, showin' out pullin' models
Let these hoes enjoy themselves, they snortin' the powder out the dollar
Thats the way it's going down when a player on the town, always keeping hoes around, drinkin, smokin by the pound

Real D boys, real, real D boys
Real D boys, real, real D boys, man we, man we out here gettin' it
Real D boys, real, real D boys
Real D boys, real, real D boys, man we, man we out here gettin' it

[Verse 2]
If there is any gwop to get, you'll see my black ass gettin' it
I got house and plenty cars, I got dough like Russel Simmons
I got game like Scottie Pippen, I got greed like Robin Givens
I got anything on 6's and a whole lot of them chickens
The feds are trying to track the dope from Tennessee to Mexico
You know how far this shit can go when profit coming from the blow
The law ain't got no shit on me, we set up like a pharmacy
[?]
The FBI can try and try and get these niggas to testify, to lock us up and shock us up but gangsta niggas multiply
We in the hood we know whats good, if it's illegal we know we should
If you had the chance to make a mill of coke nigga I know you would

[Hook]
Real D boys, real, real D boys
Real D boys, real, real D boys, man we, man we out here gettin' it
Real D boys, real, real D boys
Real D boys, real, real D boys, man we, man we out here gettin' it
Real D boys, real, real D boys
Real D boys, real, real D boys, man we, man we out here gettin' it
