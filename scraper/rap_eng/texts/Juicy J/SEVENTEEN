[Intro]
Can you believe that I you were talking to me
Could you believe that nobody was coming with me
Can you believe that I you were talking to me
Could you believe that nobody was coming with me
Can you believe that I you were talking to me
Could you believe that nobody was coming with me
Can you believe that I you were talking to me
Could you believe that nobody was coming with me
(Ready? Beam Me Up Scotty)

[Verse 1]
They praying on my downfall but they won't make it past fall
Change up like the seasons best believe ill make it past fall
Niggas getting curved I treat the game like its a fast ball
You need more than just ten toes to motherfucking stand tall
Yeah (yeah), labels on my line want me to call back (ring, ring)
But I got too many problems just to solve that
Been tryna hit my idol up he won't respond
But instead I got some groupies catching master balls
Im getting tired of the sneak diss
Tryna run a fade imma catch you when im sleeveless
Working on my flow and a nigga been breathe-less
Cooking with the dope ill let you know when the steam hits
(yuugh, aye)
Im Kim Jong with the missiles (brrat)
Better get protection i'm not Trump cuz I won't miss you
(fuck donald trump)
When all my haters die ill be motherfucking blissful
Nigga been ill somebody grab a fucking tissue (im sick)

[Hook]
Summer, fall, winter time
Cut the motherfucking check
Imma get whats fucking mine
Cut the motherfucking check
Haters put em in a line
Cut they motherfucking neck
When a nigga gets signed
Cut my motherfucking check

[Post-Hook]
Back and Im so much better
Closing down your shit
Like im inclement weather

[Beat Switch]

[Interlude]
Play this record as frequently as possible

[Bridge]
(Ready? beam me up Scotty)
Aye, never thought I'd make it
Noone take it aye
Judging my creations
You ain't make it aye
We gon run the fade
Say it to my face aye
Seventeen aye
And I'm growing past the hate

[Verse 2]
I've been bussing moves, making hits since 2015, aye
Now a nigga older and Im used to that routine, aye
Working out these bars and I ain't need no creatine
And I ain't gotta be asleep to see im living out my dreams (yeah, hoe)
If Freddy Krueger got that Ruger who's a realer shooter
All these niggas acting up like this movie got some bloopers
Control this situation, get deleted like computers
Swear this fire like a drug, hit your head just like a tumor
A nigga seventeen, few more months Im an adult
I dont know my outcome, what will be my end results
I would join illuminati but I do not fuck with cults
Swear that shit is not a myth better watch for who you trust
There would be a lot more babies if our parents gave a fuck
I mean they did well enough in terms of money and of love
But in terms of living life well I guess we fucking stuck
All these problems fucking up and still they never gave a fuck
Im mature

[Outro]
I'm mature
I'm mature
I'm mature
I'm ma-I'm mature
