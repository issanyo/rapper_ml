[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I was balling through the hood and got jacked for them birds
Put a Glock to a nigga head, bitch, what's the word?
Have you seen a young nigga on them twinkies riding clean?
White Impala with the white guts, mean on the scene
If I see that motherfucker, I'ma buck him 'til he stiff
Showing out to these project hoes, drinking on the fifth
He gon' sniff when he see me coming, aiming for the head
If you real, we can break bread, fuck it, now he dead
All them old school niggas said that boy take a trip
One week, riding Chevy thang, next thing, he flipped
Now he serving in surburban with them TVs in the 'rest
And I bet that I'm gonna hang him, hang him by his neck
Told my dogs, when they start snitching, hit me on the phone
I'm the man with the master plan, I survived the score
And I never got to [?] the fool, guess he got away
That's the chance that a nigga took, pushing keys and [?]

[Hook: Juicy J]
We got the dope
We gots the cheese
We got the folks that bring the shit overseas
We keep the coke and that hydro weed
From the bottom to the top, nigga shopping with me

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Them feds, they got a buzz, I hate when niggas who be working drugs
And now I conversate with hand over my mouth, thug
I'm down with a nation, my nation's getting dirty
Fuck with my nation Haitian, you must be getting hurty
I'm riding Crownline boat, nasty Mississippi
River, I deliver, Nextel burn hit me
Pull up with [?] with a life vest, I'm ready to go on out
Keeping my eye for coast guards, I'm throwing this purp on out
This shit is scary ferry, too many snitching bitches
They put my nigga up, they found out in his kitchen
I can't be getting hid, I roll out, have them talkers
Them folks be getting slid, heard something, made them stalkers
And now I'm on a bimb because I heard of him
These squawking-hawking bitches, stay turn to getting grim
These boys that make us, we be riding Navi trucks
Lexus trucks, Mercedes trucks, boasting back in Caddy trucks, playa

[Hook: Juicy J]
We got the dope
We gots the cheese
We got the folks that bring the shit overseas
We keep the coke and that hydro weed
From the bottom to the top, nigga shopping with me
We keep the coke and that hydro weed
From the bottom to the top, nigga shopping with me
