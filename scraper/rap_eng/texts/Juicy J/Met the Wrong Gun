[Juicy J]
[Intro]

See I ain't worried about nobody out here mane
You know what I'm sayin
Send my young niggas to get you
(GET EM!)

[Verse 1]
I send some young niggas to wait in front of you momma's house
Waiting with them berners, waitin on you to come out
When them drums hit ya bruh, you gon be burnt out
Dead on arrival, throw over the towels
I don't give a damn nigga take this shit to trial
Got a gang of young niggas in the jail house, wildin
Got the jury paid off and the federal judge
You fucking with a boss, I got all the plugs

[Chorus}

His girl lookin for him
His mami lookin for him
His kids lookin for him
His papi lookin for him
Tell his folks that he's gone and he ain't comin back home
Next time they see his body they gon need a tombstone
He done fucked around and got into it with the wrong one
Them other niggas missed his ass this time he met the wrong gun
Tell his folks that he's gone and he ain't comin back home
Next time they see his body they gon need a tombstone (Real Talk)

[Verse 2]

These niggas pussy, (Mhm) they need they guys (They scared
They won't step outside, knowin somebody gon ride (They scared)
Down on they ass guns blast 80 rounds (You scared)
If you owe me money I suggest you pay me now
I'm a street nigga hope you niggas know bruh
Last nigga try to cross me out is in a coma
I know you scared, I bet you sleep with your security, and you ain't even know that your security is fearin me
