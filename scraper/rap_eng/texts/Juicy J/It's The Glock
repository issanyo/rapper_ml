[Hook/Sample]
It's the Glock that'll get yo ass popped nigga
It's the Glock that'll get yo ass popped

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
(It's the Glock) that I will use to 187 a fool
Tryin' to be hard like he got something to prove
(It's the Glock) that got 45 written on the side
That I be aimin' to commit a homicide
(It's the Glock) that I be pointin' to pop
A washed up busta on my (?)
(It's the Glock) that's in the hands of the 6-double-6
Mafia niggas who be shootin' on you little bitch
Murder on the menu, for you and yo friends fool
Talking (?) when the Triple 6 got over a hundred guns
Never underestimate the ones that you might think is weak
I be the trigger man that kill yo ass down next week
By run up on ya, lettin' loose of the milli rounds
You know you (?) a *boom boom* sound
That's just a noise that the G-L-O-C-K make
That's why I never bother about a nigga that's fucking fake

[Hook/Sample]
It's the Glock that'll get yo ass popped nigga
It's the Glock that'll get yo ass popped

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Niggas can't not see that the Juice Mane is very sick
Don't think I won't walk up and go kill a bitch
How the fuck you thinkin', never underestimate a nigga
Cause that he might look smaller, you a little bigger
I'm not (?) before I put a punk bitch in check
Cock back the hammer of my tone and shoot for his neck
Raised in the heart of Wisconsin and the Evergreens
Stay strapped all the time with the Glock Seventeen
Back niggas wonder where the Juice Mane got it from
When I pull it out, nigga you better break and run
So it's that black thing that puts a busta in his dreams
Pop pop with the Glock, bodies drop, bodies drop
