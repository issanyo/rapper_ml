[Intro: DJ Paul]
Yeah, Hypnotize Minds!
Three 6 Mafia
Ya, you niggas wanna motherfuckin play nigga
Don't go by the Terrance playing no motherfucking TV show or movie nigga
Lookin to test me sucka?
I'll show you niggas where motherfuckin tears come from nigga
From the motherfuckin haze of these niggas guns right here boy!
It's goin down!

[Hook x2: D.J. Paul]
I told 'em (x5)
I showed 'em (x5)
I hate to be fussy, I said I hate to be fussy
I said I hate to be fussy, I swear I hate to be

[Verse 1: D.J. Paul]
Come one come all, to the Hypnotize gun show
Young ho, gun let go, I've been gung-ho
Run yo' click clean out of that shit
Did they forget, or did they not know who they was fuckin with?
D Paul, Three 6, king of this Memphis shit
Any nigga think otherwise they need to stop it
Prayin' when the red tape'll introduce a faker to they maker
Call me The Undertaker for haters causin' vapors
And you can catch a hot one, I got plenty of 'em
They called bullets and they burn just like a oven
And we can do it however, it ain't no use to play
Fire on a nigga like they used to say, ya

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Coward niggas ride 20 niggas deep
With a piece, underneath the seat, make 'em think they street
I don't need nobody else, whip you by myself
One on one, leave the guns at home, keep 'em on the shelf
But you can't, cause you need a crew, extra fist or two
Only one might really shoot, but that is not you
And you show out, try to buck, make 'em think you tough
Been to jail about a couple times, I guess that puffed you up
If you real nigga what the deal, Take some weed or pills
Maybe thinkin' get your confidence up, tell 'em how you feel
You a joke, and a fuck nigga, can't stand yo' grind
But you walk around, fake-ass frown, but I know you're a clown
Bitch!

[Hook]
