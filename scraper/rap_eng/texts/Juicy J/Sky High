Ain't go, ain't go, ain't go
Ain't go even lie my nig I'm higher than I ever been
Ain't go even lie my nig I'm higher than I ever been
Ain't go even lie my nig I'm higher than I ever been

Ain't go even lie my nig I'm higher than I ever been
Ain't go even lie my nig I'm higher than I ever been
Shawty I stay fresher than your baby daddy ever been

4 bricks and my styrofoam that's the shit that I've be on
Roll me up, roll me up
Naked ladies I'm rolling, bruh
I'm Cobain high I don't plan on coming down
You're working on a zip I just finished a quarter pound
Jucy J, my dog DJ Rock Steady
Bring that shit back, man!
Play that shit one more time nigga
One more time, nigga, one more time, nigga!

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
4 bricks and my styrofoam that's the shit that I've be on
Roll me up, roll me up
Naked ladies I'm rolling, bruh
I'm Cobain high I don't plan on coming down
You're working on a zip I just finished a quarter pound
You know it!
Glaze like Clyde invite a stripper over
Get her high then I hit it from behind!
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, ain't trying to fuck
What a hell you bitches try to call me for?
Fuck these hoes!
Tripping slipping, never tripping
I get dro lit
Popping po, pothrow money on all these hoes!
When you're trippy, like I'm trippy
That's just how I go
Bad chick doing dough, flying in a row!

[Hook: Young Dolph]

[Verse 2: Young Dolph ]
They say they're smoking good while I'm smoking better
Strong weed and codeine bitch get on my level
Yeah I fuck with juicy yep I'm trippy
I called my bitch the wrong name and she say I'm tripping!
I stay fresher than your baby daddy that I've ever been
She says she guess that's why I get the pussy wetter then
You're damn right, I smoke a blunt with her and thirty minutes later I'm in a king size laying pipe
And yeah I'm a dog but I don't give a damn!
You want the boyfriend, you got the wrong nigga, man!
Dolce hat and Gabbana kicks fresher than yo baby daddy on that Dolph Gabbana shit
