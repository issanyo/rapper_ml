[Hook: Lola Monroe]
Roll the weed up
Throw them g's up
Who my niggas g'd up
Mackaveli, Mackaveli, Mackaveli
So niggas gotta see us
Mackaveli, Mackaveli, Mackaveli

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
My niggas is killers they will run up in your spot
Word on the town is you been movin' them blocks
But we know the truth, you just a nigga that fly
Like to show out in public and lie to these broads
We makin' money nigga we don't lie to kick it
Got a room full of money bed full of bitches
And they all geeked up all love kissing
And if you call her on your phone she gon' tell you she busy
Out here, hatin' on a nigga wanna start beef
Man you're out here, on these streets like it's all sweet
They gon' get your ass, slip and they gon' call me
And I'm gon' tell em go ahead and put his ass to sleep

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lola Monroe]
Queen Roe for the record better go and get better
Soldier [?] like the letter
Cus mine leave clips in your head like barretas
Bitch so cold everybody's got a sweater
Prayin' hail mary all these eyes on me
But still I rise like resurrections demise on key
Thug life, thug life let me get this mug right
Fuck type your life when niggas cut white, raw
I don't dump no work she don't want that work I mean it bitch I ball
[?] and checks I'm banking bitch I call the shots
The clock you block, you shop and shop
My og taught me how to Al Capone a bitch for fun
So his boss said mafia my bitches pulled one

[Hook]
