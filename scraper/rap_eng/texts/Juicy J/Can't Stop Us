[Verse 1]

Keep hustlin' bruh, mhm
Never give up (you know it)
Keep gettin' paper...
It's hard times, niggas be loosin' they mind
Out here merking other niggas because they lost they shine
My old man told me "these the last days"
Errbody tryna get money at a fast pace
At any rate, my enemy ain't necessary
I'mma take--errthing that a nigga work hard for
I'm getting money while you niggas acting hardcore
Being famous, what these young niggas strive for
They real, showin stress while these niggas smoking Marlboro's
A lot of homies costin' homies triple trillion niggas
Fuck nigga, call off, and we sprayin' niggas
Never be no gun play, a youngin' with a throw-away
Hit a nigga with a five-k, leave you in your driveway
My pockets felt like Biggie, but I'm still chasing
I can barely see you haters, all I want is paper
Real money, that's all I can think of making (BITCH!)
Real trippy nigga, this a money nation (TRIPPY!)
Old money, spending Three-Six checks
And I'm still goin' hard like I ain't paid yet
Bought a couple cars (uh)
Got a couple of cribs (cribs)
Fucked a bunch of movie stars, this the life I live (life I live!)
These rappers falling off, going bankrupt (YUP)
But me, I got a million ways to stack my change up! (You know it!)
Don't a day go by, a nigga don't eat
A Memphis legend countin' money.. T-G-O-D!

[Hook x2]

They can't stop a real hustler from getting guap
They gon' down the block, we open up another spot (WE OPEN)
They can't stop a real D-boy from shinin'
They lock a nigga up, we jump out grindin'
They can't stop a real pimp from pimpin' hoes, cus
Pimpin' goes on in all area codes (IKE TURNER)
They Can't Stop Us! [x4]
