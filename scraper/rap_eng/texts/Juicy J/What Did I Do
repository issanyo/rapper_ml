[Intro: Juicy J]
Play me some of that suicide pimpin', man
This a $crim beat
Damn what i do
Ain't shit crazy mane
Nigga out here hustling
And still always some bullshit
That's why i don't fuck with a lot of niggas
DJ $crim with that 808

[Chorus]
What I do? Why you mad?
All I did was check a bag
Let that money work for me
And put some more up in the stash
What I do? Why you mad?
I told you secure the bag
You lost it all, go get it back
'Cause them streets won't give it back
I'm makin' moves, that's what I do
Ay, you ain't mad, is you?
I'm the shit, my bitch is bad
Ay, you ain't mad, is you?
Just spent a grip on that new whip
Ay, you ain't mad, is you?
I went from nothin' to somethin'
Ay, you ain't mad, is you?

[Post Hook]
What did i do to make your life so sad?
I never played around, i never acted bad

{Verse 1]
I'm gettin' better with this fame
Tell me what I did to make these niggas act so lame
All I did was give 'em all the sauce and all the game
The players always change, but the bosses stay the same
When you at the top you like the only one to blame
Naw we ain't no slaves, but my niggas got whips and chains
Got the big body, but still I stay in my lane
Tell me what I did to make niggas say that I changed

[Chorus]
What I do? Why you mad?
All I did was check a bag
Let that money work for me
And put some more up in the stash
What I do? Why you mad?
I told you secure the bag
You lost it all, go get it back
'Cause them streets won't give it back
I'm makin' moves, that's what I do
Ay, you ain't mad, is you?
I'm the shit, my bitch is bad
Ay, you ain't mad, is you?
Just spent a grip on that new whip
Ay, you ain't mad, is you?
I went from nothin' to somethin'
Ay, you ain't mad, is you?

[Post Hook]
What did i do to make your life so sad?
I never played around, i never acted bad

[Verse 2]
You ain't no different from these other niggas
That's what she said before she seen the way I'm livin'
Now she know the difference
That pussy mine
Ay, you ain't mad, is you?
Now you her last nigga
'Cause you ain't last nigga
Got niggas callin' me the goat
Ay, you ain't mad, is you?
I got mad issues
I don't trust none, I let this mag hit you
I been official since before the whistle
It's like you hate to see me winnin'
But you never seen me go against you

[Chorus]
What I do? Why you mad?
All I did was check a bag
Let that money work for me
And put some more up in the stash
What I do? Why you mad?
I told you secure the bag
You lost it all, go get it back
'Cause them streets won't give it back
I'm makin' moves, that's what I do
Ay, you ain't mad, is you?
I'm the shit, my bitch is bad
Ay, you ain't mad, is you?
Just spent a grip on that new whip
Ay, you ain't mad, is you?
I went from nothin' to somethin'
Ay, you ain't mad, is you?

[Post Hook]
What did i do to make your life so sad?
I never played around, i never acted bad
