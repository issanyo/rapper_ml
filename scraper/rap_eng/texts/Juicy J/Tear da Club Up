[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
This for all the playa haters who be talkin' that shit
The Three 6 show no love, we quick to murder a trick
You could be a friend or foe, kinda down or not
I'm rollin' with tha fool Crunchy and we got them Glocks
Backed up by da 4-5 and a .38
You wanna take this click to war? Fool it'll be a mistake
Chris bring the mossberg with the slugs and shit
We got some graves for ya body already dug and shit
Infamous grab the cali with a 100 rounds
Koopsta load da tech and blow them bastards down
Juice wit the two 9's like the nigga name Shae
On the move we shoot 'em up so slow they feel the pain
I thought you knew that I'm from Memphis where the shit is so thick
When at the club we get so buck we try to tear up sum shit
Gangsta Boo da gangsta bitch wit the .357
Our main goal in life is an opposite heaven
Triple 6 bitch!

[Hook: Three 6 Mafia]
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Deadly
We should begin to come closer to killa dimensions
Niggas getting lynchin's from the Triple 6 anti-christians
May I mention the slizzugs that I blaze, Scarecrow's unmerciful
Bullets are bombin' da enemy nigga, see death is unreversable
Hardness is your fantasy, death is not fiction on you bitches
Fuck around and find yo wannabe gangsta ass with the mortician
Executioner style, buck in yo head while ya beg on yo knees
Plenty of bustas been put in the morgue and they chilly down in the cold freezers
Teflon penetratin' and the penalty is deadly punishment
Then me and my Triple 6 we go and blow an ounce of blue hair trick
I could give a fuck less, bitch I'm glad that you dead and gone
Three 6 Mafia sign our names on niggas fuckin' tombstones
Memphis is the fuckin' city where Lord Infamous loves to bail
And just like I said before, bitch, come with me to hell
Everybody in this house, you niggas know what's up
Lemme see can all you muthafuckas tear this club up

[Hook: Three 6 Mafia]
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
All these playa hatas in the club got us fucked up
Yes I'm the nigga with them two 9's ready to blast
When I pull 'em out you muthafuckas better haul ass
Paul thowin' chairs in tha air, Koopsta locin' up
Fly takin' cash from yo ass - Mr. Stick Em Up
Fuck da damn sucurity, fuck a muthafuckin cop
If they kick me out da club I'll buck 'em in tha parkin' lot
Grab the club owner, put the rich bitch in the trunk
Take 'em out and take his money then I spit on da punk
Now I'm crunk, breakin' bottles up against da fuckin' wall
Shootin' tones at them fools till them jealous bustas fall
For these niggas testin' pimpin': we gon' bury all you hoes
Slicin' bitches right in half, stompin 'em straight through tha floor
Niggas talkin plenty shit but they ain't buck enough
We gon' get some dynamite and blow this muthafucka up

[Hook: Three 6 Mafia]
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up

Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
