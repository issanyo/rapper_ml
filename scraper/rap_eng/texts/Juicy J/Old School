[Intro]
Yo, TM
Play me some pimpin' mane
Anybody got an old school out there mane
Rev that shit up

[Hook]
Ok I'm old school riding
Tinted like I'm hiding
Four fifty four in a trunk when I'm sliding
12's in the trunk, beat the streets like they violent
8's on the feet, you probably couldn't even drive 'em
Ok I'm old school riding
Tinted like I'm hiding
Four fifty four in a trunk when I'm sliding
12's in the trunk, beat the streets like they violent
8's on the feet, you probably couldn't even drive 'em

[Verse 1]
Ok I did it all in one day
Pulled up on that one way
Still a hood nigga, pullin' bitches off the runway
Had to take these niggas straight to church like a Sunday
Please don't run up on me cause my youngin's 'bout that gun play
And niggas get murdered in my city for them old schools
Nigga pull you right up out your shit like they 'posed to
So don't let 'em catch your ass lacking like I told you
Niggas treat your ass like a chair, they'll fold you
Pinky ring hanging out the window, looking like a lick
Step up out the whip all white, looking like a brick
Wood grain gripping, that's the K, I'm riding with the stick
Diamonds in my mouth, that's a karat every time I spit

[Hook]
Ok I'm old school riding
Tinted like I'm hiding
Four fifty four in a trunk when I'm sliding
12's in the trunk, beat the streets like they violent
8's on the feet, you probably couldn't even drive 'em
Ok I'm old school riding
Tinted like I'm hiding
Four fifty four in a trunk when I'm sliding
12's in the trunk, beat the streets like they violent
8's on the feet, you probably couldn't even drive 'em

[Verse 2]
Ok it's 3 in the morning, naw I ain't yawning
Hopped up in the old school, I just jumped out the foreign
A zip what I'm rolling and an eight what I'm pouring
Wanna fuck me in my car, she say her nigga boring
8's on the feet, I just call that shit the high life
Wanna see me do that shit again, that's a highlight
Don't ask me why I smoke this Mary J cause this is my life
Weed so many different colors call it tie-die
Smoking on the good stuff, fillin' up my lungs
Sippin' on that dirty dirty 'til a nigga numb
Know some niggas that'll come and get ya for the fun
I'm ridin' dirty, fuck a thirty, bitch I got a drum

[Hook]
Ok I'm old school riding
Tinted like I'm hiding
Four fifty four in a trunk when I'm sliding
12's in the trunk, beat the streets like they violent
8's on the feet, you probably couldn't even drive 'em
Ok I'm old school riding
Tinted like I'm hiding
Four fifty four in a trunk when I'm sliding
12's in the trunk, beat the streets like they violent
8's on the feet, you probably couldn't even drive 'em

[Outro]
That beat harder than a motherfucker TM
