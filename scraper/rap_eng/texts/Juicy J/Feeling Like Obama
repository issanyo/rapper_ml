She try'na fuck me through the text
Told her I don't want the sex
Told her bring me back the check

Where I'm from it's all about the dollar sign but you gotta keep a vest

Ain't got no bible but I still got all my blessings though
I'm from the dirty dirty but I'm still a fresh ass dough
She like "why you always workin'?", I can't help it hoe
She like "where your plug from?" I'm like Mexico
When I'm in the A I'm smokin' on that Texico
She like "who that?" that's G-O, he the next to blow
You can't hang with the gang, bitch it's time to go
I can have which one I want like eenie meenie miney moe
Niggas in their feelings and I put that on my momma nigga
And they talkin' millions but can barely touch a comma nigga
You ain't gettin' pussy, you a virgin, no Madonna nigga
You ain't paid your rent, mane I put that in my llama nigga
And I put that on my momma nigga
I put that on my momma nigga

[Hook]
