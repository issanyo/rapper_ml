[Wiz Khalifa: Hook]
Left my old bitch at home, got a new one (6x)

[Juicy J: Verse 1]
My bitch asked me do I love her
I tell her "Yeah"
But the truth is I only love the head
Always on her knees, never using her legs
I don't trust her neither, she just want Juicy bread
Got a new bitch, shit I got 2 or 3
What they do for free, everything they do for me
They eat each other's pussy, I just like to see
Fuck a bourgie ass bitch, all I like is freaks
Got that liquor in me, now I'm a born star
I pull the whip over and fuck her in my foreign car
I'm so fuckin' high I need some new lungs
Left my old bitch at home, got a new one

[Hook]

[Juicy J: Verse 2]
I got a new bitch, I met her in Cali
I gave her my number, she gave me her panties
Lil mama can blow, so I gave her a Grammy
I don't even know her name, I think it was Tammy
I just met a Cuban bitch out in Miami
Shaped like a Coke bottle, hot as a cannon
She could be an actress, she might be a model
It don't matter to me, long as that ho swallow
I'm her's for tonight, I'm leaving tomorrow
It's back off in my mansion, it's somebody's daughter
She dancin' like she fuckin' her mama who taught her
Then I kick her out cause I got enough stalkers

[Hook]
