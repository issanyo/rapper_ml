[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Late last night, I was in the bed, eyes red
Thinking about Project Pat and what that fucking jury said
Guilty what they gave him then they put him in handcuffs
Motherfuck them laws, I'ma make you put yo hands up
Don't cross the line, yellow tape the police brand up
Outside the court, North Memphis and we clanned up
I can be a leader, bring the heater like I'm Farrakhan
I can be a terrorist to the government like a Taliban
Long as ya black and you rich they put they targets on
Watching niggas every move, tappin' niggas cell phones
Don't fall for the okie doke, call and I'll bring the dope
And we can smoke weed till the break of dawn
Trapped in this hood where there ain't no motherfucking bond
And to that officer, I know your stompin' ground here
But If you ain't from my hood, get yo ass from round here

[Verse 2: Crunchy Blac]
First I'm gonna catch the bitch
Then I'm gonna beat the bitch
Then I'm gonna bury bitch
Shouldn't of been talkin' shit
Knew who you was fucking with
Fucking with the fucking best
She who you fucking been
Now I'm aiming at yo chest
This goes out to all of y'all
All of y'all be talking shit
Slip the clip up in the gun
Then commence to bust a nig
Bust a nig, at ya dawg
Watchin' you niggas fall
Screamin' out like a bitch
Mane that's just some petty shit
Petty shit

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
I'm into blood baths, I don't fight or punch ya
I'ma hit yo ass with the fucking rocket launcher
Can you stand the pain, Insane Bounty Hunta
Stomp long, see ya punk, till ya unconscious
Throw you in the dumpster, Lord catch and conquer
Lord don't pistol play, jump up, if ya want to
This is the under, buried by yo momma
Not only do I murder mane I also embalm ya

[Juicy J]
Picture this, you a juror and you on the stand
And you 'bout to judge the life of a black man
Young brother from the hood made it rappin' and
With a knot in his pocket weighing least a grand
Here's the story, he got caught with some fire arms
By a crooked ass cop with his siren on
He was known as a felon made it bigger than state
The whole case turned fed made him lose his faith
Picture this, now the judge, he got hatred for crooks
Because ten years ago, he was appointed by bush
Republican white man, and he don't give a fuck
If the guns wasn't his, that was found in his truck
Prosecutors, shady lawyers, mane who can you trust
All this palm greasy shit, mane it's bigger than us
Make you wanna be like fuck it, hit the trunk of the car
Deliberation, it was time for the jury to start
