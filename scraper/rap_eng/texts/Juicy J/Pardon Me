[Intro: Juicy J]
The hustle continues
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga
Yeah nigga, yeah

[Hook]
Pardon me, pardon me
Hardest in your hood, you ain't shit to me
Pardon me, pardon me
I don't give a fuck who you supposed to be, nigga
Pardon me, pardon me
Nggas run they mouth, end up 20 feet
Pardon me, pardon me
You talking about that fuck nigga, put his ass to sleep

[Verse 1]
Sold the dope, told the nigga not to hold the dope
Get the cash hit the drop, bring it back watch your ass
Niggas plottin’ caught you snitchin’, left you lickin same niggas
Watch your braggin’  same niggas
You count your hundreds cause you fucked up now you dead & lonely
Broke, you fucked up now you dead & lonely
7 in the morning, streets is yawnin'
My niggas is back on the corners
My niggas is back with them choppas that show where they jam when they clip is reloaded they blam
North nigga from the mud up to no good
Sold million records but I keep that .38 snub tuck
Ready for war, fuck nigga talking shit, lets go to war
I ain't into poppin' shit fuck nigga, this is the north
Mafia mothafuckin' 36 straight hitters out for this door
My shottas unload, we even the score
Its real as it get, don't get exposed, don't get exposed

[Hook]
Pardon me, pardon me
Hardest in your hood, you ain't shit to me
Pardon me, pardon me
I don't give a fuck who you supposed to be, nigga
Pardon me, pardon me
Nggas run they mouth, end up 20 feet
Pardon me, pardon me
You talking about that fuck nigga, put his ass to sleep

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Against all odds, back to the wall
I'm coming for my cut like a act to the law
Gimme what you owe me, don't do me no favours
I got now, so fuck you later
The gutter done turned us all into gladiators
Try me and get stomped, like an [?]
Get money, everything else don't mean nothing
Price on yo head, niggas get rich, you see them comin'
Them goons on the way, if I push a button
Act a fool if ya wanna, we pull up right beside ya
Semi auto at ya driver, you don't wan't this drama
We just want the money, you don't fuck with niggas like us

[Hook]
Pardon me, pardon me
Hardest in your hood, you ain't shit to me
Pardon me, pardon me
I don't give a fuck who you supposed to be, nigga
Pardon me, pardon me
Nggas run they mouth, end up 20 feet
Pardon me, pardon me
You talking about that fuck nigga, put his ass to sleep

[Verse 3: G.O.D.]
Pardon me, shit ain't hard to me
I done have to beef with niggas thas across the street
Pardon me, shit ain't hard to see
You won't find another nigga that's as hard as me
Pardon me, just might park to see
Multiplying all my hunnids, I'm a double G
Nigga I be on the bullshit, number twenty-three
Let me demonstrate a murder to the first degree
Catch you posted on the corner, open for the three
Think fast, chest press, that assist for me
Let Nina sing to em like the symphony
Rock a bye lullaby, put his ass to sleep

[Hook]
Pardon me, pardon me
Hardest in your hood, you ain't shit to me
Pardon me, pardon me
I don't give a fuck who you supposed to be, nigga
Pardon me, pardon me
Nggas run they mouth, end up 20 feet
Pardon me, pardon me
You talking about that fuck nigga, put his ass to sleep
