[Verse 1]

It's a matter of time for he drop that dime
(Lets hear him out mane)
I ain't buyin, I know where he live I am spyin'
I gonna kill the nigga tryna to fuck over mine
Nigga wit the po'-po'
Yo life is ova
Snitch on me I'mma hit ya wit the 44
Have young niggas runnin' in out ya back door
(Dey got him through the weed smoke)
And I told that nigga so
He didn't follow my rules
Broke niggas do need tools
I'm gone fix this problem
Point the gun and shoot
Nigga is you wit it cause you sound kind of spooky
And I'll burn yo ass if you try to cross me too

[Hook]

Call the police with yo rattin' ass
I knew you workin' for dem folks wit yo rattin' ass
You gon' meet a young nigga wit a black mask
He might chase you down the block
He might take yo cash
But he came take yo life and he gon' do it fast
You gon' meet a young nigga wit a black mask

[Verse 2]

Watch these niggas on cell phones
Record your conversation
To give yo shit to the feds bra
They need somebody to tell on
They tryin' to get them time cuts
But I'll be like your time's up
Catch that nigga and tie him up
Bury that nigga in Pine Bluff
Arkansas, Nigga this a war like shock and awe
I don't give a fuck don't stop at all
Line dem rats up to the wall
Like Al Capone did, kill them all
Some niggas think they so street
Weak ass niggas can't fool me
When they face them 20 years
They become a mouthpiece

[Hook]
