[Hook:]
Still gettin' money, still ridin' fly
Still poppin' bottles, still gettin' high
I say I'm still gettin' money, still ridin' fly
Still poppin' bottles, still gettin' high
That's cause I know, I know, I know you watchin'
I know, I know, I know you watchin'
I know, I know, I know you watchin'
I know, I know, I know you watchin'

[Verse 1:]
Silly bitch, stop tellin' 'em lies, ho stop spreading 'em rumors
Juicy J, self made skinny nigga, pockets on Yokozuna
She wanna ride like Yokohomas
She fine like Pocahontas
I just might slide off in her without no Jimmy, I'm just being honest
Still counting up trigonomics, still got heat, you doubt us
Fuck around gets you a coozy ass casket playin' 'round with my commas
America KKK most wanted, need to free all my homies
X-ray vision in this crooked ass business, I can see most y'all niggas phony
I'm with somebody else wife, I told my driver bring the car around
Beat the pussy like Iron Mike, bang, bang, bang, bang, lights out
Blowin' on presidentials, 'bout to pull up at my white house
You at home, tryna hit her phone, she got my wife beater on as a nightgown

[Hook:]
Still gettin' money, still ridin' fly
Still poppin' bottles, still gettin' high
I say I'm still gettin' money, still ridin' fly
Still poppin' bottles, still gettin' high
That's cause I know, I know, I know you watchin'
I know, I know, I know you watchin'
I know, I know, I know you watchin'
I know, I know, I know you watchin'

[Verse 2:]
She full of that cheap vodka, bitch hairy like Chewbacca
She got the nerve to be bouche too? man, all these hoes do is gossip
Who you fuck for the red bottoms? I heard about you, you a head doctor
You just lookin' for a quick come up? I can feel it in the air like Phil Collins
I'm in a old school Dodge Charger, flyer than a Red Robbin
I got goons and I got goblins, I ball hard like Dennis Rodman
Niggas hatin' on me, what's the problem?
Is you mad cuz I'm running shit and y'all jogging
Is you mad, cuz I shake and bake Ricky Bobby
I'm a muthafuckin giant like Tiki Barber
Comin' from a cut like a blind barber
When I drive by, my car look like a flyin' saucer
Still don't want your lady? She lucky if she even get a dime off me
It's crazy what my last 5G cost me
Sip lean in the mornin', never tried coffee
Fuck her once, kick her out, bitch, start walkin'
Gettin' paid in the bed like it's my office, that's cuz I'm

[Hook:]
Still gettin' money, still ridin' fly
Still poppin' bottles, still gettin' high
I say I'm still gettin' money, still ridin' fly
Still poppin' bottles, still gettin' high
That's cause I know, I know, I know you watchin'
I know, I know, I know you watchin'
I know, I know, I know you watchin'
I know, I know, I know you watchin'

[Outro:]
Hopped up in my car (swag!) then I drop my roof
Wet like wonton soup. That's just how I do (swag!)
Then I park my car, then I fuck your bitch
Eat that wonton soup, wet like wonton soup
We Trippy Mane!
