[Hook]
We be deep in da hood, standin' the cuts
Come through with the shit and we gon shoot your shit up
We be deep in da hood, standin' the cuts
Come through with the shit and we gon shoot your shit up

And our choppers go blocka blocka blocka blocka blocka
And our choppers go blocka blocka blocka blocka blocka
And our choppers go blocka blocka blocka blocka blocka
And our choppers go blocka blocka blocka blocka blocka

[Verse 1]
Nigga fuck your hood, nigga fuck your set
I'm that killer with the rusted tec
I'm nigga realer that will break your neck
I'm that nigga that you don't fuck with
I always knew you niggas weren't real
I always knew you niggas would tell
I always knew you niggas would fail
I hope you niggas know I'm still getting this mail
And ridin' on 6's, fuckin' with bitches
Hustle all day, man get my issue
By sellin dope never workin at Krystal
Walk up  in the bank and pull out a pistol
Nigga I'll rob you, gimme that cheese
Give me that car nigga  give me them keys
A sawed off pump nigga you can get these
With his beloved color eagle YT
Don't violate and the guns get bigger
I'm from the north straight real street nigga
Haters gon hate, y'all niggas ain't killas
So why you wanna put yourself in front of my trigger
Thats suicide bruh all coke dup
Standin on the block nigga all post up
You'd better hide, the whole street lit up
I'm takin out the trash nigga dump dump dump

[Hook]
We be deep in da hood, standin' the cuts
Come through with the shit and we gon shoot your shit up
We be deep in da hood, standin' the cuts
Come through with the shit and we gon shoot your shit up

And our choppers go blocka blocka blocka blocka blocka
And our choppers go blocka blocka blocka blocka blocka
And our choppers go blocka blocka blocka blocka blocka
And our choppers go blocka blocka blocka blocka blocka
