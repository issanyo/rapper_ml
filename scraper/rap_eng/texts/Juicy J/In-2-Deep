Yeah, you better watch the situation you gettin' involved in (Yeah)
You might get involved with the wrong people
Get into a situation you might can't get yourself out of (In too deep)
Dig a hole you can't climb out
You know what I'm saying
Get in it too deep

[Hook: Three 6 Mafia] 2x
I'm in it too deep to get on out
They always told me death was the only way out
I'm sitting up all night, I can never rest my head
How will my family take it if I ended up dead?

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
There was a man who approached me every night
When I was resting fast asleep
He traveled deep into my mind
And he promised me power beyond my wildest dreams
He said he could take me away from the suffering
Begging and our poverty
So I had to agree, there's one catch:
I must worship him throughout the centuries
But I really didn't know any better
I'm tired of the pain and Koop taught me running
He gave me the things he promised to me
But I cannot leave I will suffer forever
I'm tired of this wrong
But all his powers are much too strong
Oh so bad I want to move on
But if I do my soul is gone
Liars, fornicators, all you murderers, adulterers, and thieves
What you don't know
Is that you're walking in the same shoes with me

[Verse 2: Koopsta Knicca]
Nothin' but a novelty, that's all I see
Is he close to me
He said is she Victoria Secret
Hells of the air with the smells of a prayer
Bled right here with a stale bud
Doggystyled in a chair
Turned him on his stomach
And she's moaning from the motion
If you ready for the sticky green
Koop finna come a little bit closer
Rolled him over just before a sound went pop
Then I reached for my heart
Oh my god Koopsta just been robbed
I hope you feel me
I'm laying naked lookin' at the ceiling
In bloody red
Just same old same for the Koopstas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gangsta Boo]
I'm in it too deep to escape this kind of drama
That costs us playa hatas and fakers
That equals problems
Today in this day in time
You can't read nobody's mind
These smiles turn to frowns
When they see a playa on the rise
On top of the world
Just a lookin' down and laughing at'cha
I never be bothered like 2pac
I ain't mad at'cha
So baby beware
This game of life is like do or die
It's hell on this earth
The only thing that's missin' is the fire
Come on baby tell me
Is it something that your eyes can't see
Or are you just blind to the fact that you in it too deep

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
Yeah I know what ya mean
I had to stand on my ground
To give them the scene
Just me and my brotha down in the struggle
Then I serve 'em to the fiends
And after dark, deep in the park, them doped up fiends
Would start to light their pipe all through the night
I use to wonder will God
Please help the poor come up on their feet
Cause there was nothing to eat
Didn't want to jack or rob
A brotha had to maintain the streets
Up in the projects wasn't no flodgin'
Cause I was trying to get out who can you trust
I had to be tough, I never ran my mouth
Me and the crew would constantly hit the brew
A natural high
How can you make it in this world but to try

[Verse 5: DJ Paul]
1991 was the year, 901 was the area code
Three eight double one six
Was the zip code of all the roads we rode
Now let my story be told
A young boy dropping out of school house
But not to learn off in the 10th grade
Try to come up at last like a total outcast
Off all them songs I done made
Boom my undergound tapes up and down the hall
To DJ Paul wasn't no damn thing
But to my dogs Tony and Shysta
Asked me to join a gang "that ain't me manne"
But hanging around them fools
I had to get down and join the click see
Cause I made so many enemies
From clicks up in my city
Now if I told ya what gang it was
Then to you I would seem more than down
But if I told ya what gang I'm in
I can only do a show off in my own town
But it's all to the good
Much love to the thugs an my good
And in my set much respect
I wit'cha for life that cha can bet
We lights one up tonight

[Hook]
