[Hook]
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire
I got that super fire, I got that super fire
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire
I got that super fire, I got that super fire
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire
I got that super fire, I got that super fire
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire
I got that super fire, I got that super fire

[Verse 1]
Rolling through my old hood, old school Chevrolet
Saw Big Trice and his momma had to get a plate
Running to my old hoe from back in the day
Made a nigga reminisce, now I miss that phase
Put a Chevy to the classic, why they tailgate
See my nigga from the hood, I throw 'em some paper
What a great day in Memphis, proud to be a G
Beale Stree, Wet Willy's, me and Heavy C
Getting ready for the show later on, got a suite at the Medicine, bad bitch come through
Got a shortclub rain, I'ma make it rain, strippers go nuts when they see Juice
I'ma throw [?] had to regroup
I be everywhere I never see you
Every girl stripper named candy, god damn it, tell 'em I got a sweet tooth

[Hook]
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire
I got that super fire, I got that super fire
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire
I got that super fire, I got that super fire
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire
I got that super fire, I got that super fire
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire
I got that super fire, I got that super fire

[Verse 2]
Came a long way from public housing to a house on the mountains
Now I got a chef, chaffeaur and an accountant, I'm fly as a falcon
Back then we used to ride spinners, I bought the [?] every winter
Never ride classics, paint just splashing, never even got tint on the windows
A zip and a double cup, don't mind me, I'm bout to juice up
Pour out some drank for Lord Infamous
Pour a lil more for Koopsta
Feasting on all this cake, who would known I'd ball one day
All day long, get stoned and faded, this check cleared every time my phone vibrate
Let's get it
Stop by Andre to play 2K I picked the
Grizzlies, then hit the strip club and play with ass and
Titties, I swear today was a good day
Smoking on the Juicy J
My own strain is on the way now let's get trippy

[Hook]
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire
I got that super fire, I got that super fire
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire
I got that super fire, I got that super fire
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire
I got that super fire, I got that super fire
Drippy lean, pouring high, burning green, super fire
I got that super fire, I got that super fire
