[Hook – Juicy J][x8]
Blowing strong, chiefing Cheech and Chong
Bitch I stuffed the bong

[Verse 1 – Curtis Williams]
Strong all in my new pack
Same niggas, got new cash
I sip slow but I live fast
Haters mad, my mom glad
Make that, I spend that
Buy shit, you just rent that
Talking like some money, if you listen you might make that
Chase that
We ain’t used to having, had to chase that
Straight facts
This ain’t make believe boy this is straight facts
Way back
Now my money old and we go way back
Laid back
Now I twist my dutchs and I lay back
A million dollars for conversations
Till then I’m still being patient and waiting
Know we been the greatest
They hate it but still debating
Even they know we up next
My brother Rel said chill
They don’t be knowning your stress
But now it’s [?] all my new shit
Two-9, that’s my crew bitch
My old chick your new chick
Been working hard, I need a new crib
Big blunt on my two lips
We facing these, don’t pass these, got a few licks

[Hook][x8]

[Verse 2 – Project Pat]
Project Patta, purple smoker, pussy poker
Foreign whip, got your girl’s eyes like I'm coca
Loud smoker, distributor, loud broker
Cali weed stay in my lungs, loud smoker
My color man, is green, green, green green green
Money train, all we hear is ching, ching ching ching
Blowing on that Samsung, inhaling that Hercules
Pounds of that Northern Cali, man we murking these
I been blowing on green since I was a fetus
Talking city slick but I’m country just like Cleatous
You want that Cheech and Chong
You need to come and see us
Cause while you sitting round, we sitting next to Jesus
(Halleluyer) [x2]
