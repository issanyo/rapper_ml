[Hook x2: Stuey Rock]
I'm just tryna fuck so what's up, what's up?
I'm just tryna fuck so what's up, what's up?
I'm just tryna fuck so what's up, what's up?
I'm just, I'm just tryna fuck
I'm just, I'm just tryna fuck

[Verse 1: Stuey Rock]
I'm just tryna fuck so what's up?
Don't be no nosy bitch tryna worry what's in my cup
A triple shot of Crown raw, got hoes up in the back
Bunch of fresh ass niggas that don't know how to act
Is that Gucci? Nah, bitch I don't wear that
Armani, Lenox Mall shopping, where you niggas work at?
Just our usual discount, hit that [?]
Yeah, I fucked your friend a long time ago but it don't count
They be like "Stuey Rock
Man, he just singing and singing"
That's that shit that got my name rangin' and bangin'
Fiending, music got you leanin'
And if you stay the night bitch, you gon' be cleanin', cleanin'

[Hook x2: Stuey Rock]
I'm just tryna fuck so what's up, what's up?
I'm just tryna fuck so what's up, what's up?
I'm just tryna fuck so what's up, what's up?
I'm just, I'm just tryna fuck
I'm just, I'm just tryna fuck

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
We trippy mane!
Don't remember her name, I call her "Bubble Butt"
Lil mama must be from the circus how she juggle nuts
I tell her ride the dick, make sure she buckle up
No time for lovey-dovey, bitch I don't cuddle up (I told ya!)
I don't know where I'm at, don't even know where I been
'Soon as I sober up we, we gon' do it again
Freaky white girl, and a few of her friends
Mercedes bubble gum gettin' chewed on again
I'm fucked up, she fucked up
I'm still living single, even with them double cups
I'm sloppy drunk and private plane high
Two bitches sucking me to sleep at the same time

[Hook x2: Stuey Rock]
I'm just tryna fuck so what's up, what's up?
I'm just tryna fuck so what's up, what's up?
I'm just tryna fuck so what's up, what's up?
I'm just, I'm just tryna fuck
I'm just, I'm just tryna fuck

[Verse 3: Slim Dunkin]
[?] bang on her forhead
Picture told 'em bootleg
Shawty go both way, his or her [?]
Mama got that pro-head
Promethazine slow-head
I fucked her, he fucked her, she fucked her
That, that's fosho-head
I'm just tryna fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
It is what it is or it ain't hoe!
Go home without you? I don't think so
What the fuck you think I'm 'bout that drank for?
If she follow she'll swallow me
Listerine gargle me
Fucked your bitch in your bed, no for apologies
Pocket full of cash, you can just call me [?]
Dirty Boys and Dirt Gang
Snatch it then we passin' numbers
Fuck her with the lights on, know I kept the ice on
BBB, got her wrestle with a python

[Hook x2: Stuey Rock]
I'm just tryna fuck so what's up, what's up?
I'm just tryna fuck so what's up, what's up?
I'm just tryna fuck so what's up, what's up?
I'm just, I'm just tryna fuck
I'm just, I'm just tryna fuck

[Outro x2: Stuey Rock]
I'm just tryna fuck
I'm just tryna fuck
