[Verse: Pouya]
I’m back in a cycle
Feel like a psycho
Feel like I’m Michael, yuh
Don’t look at my bread, don’t look at my whip
Take a look at my fico, yuh
I’m pacin’ and thinkin’ of robbin’ a bank with the homies I hang with
These hoes wanna make it the bank or the banquet

Come hang with the gang get shady
Drunk drove in a Mercedes
.45 on the hip daily
Screamin’ out fuck you pay me
I ain’t patient, I got OCD
Feel like I’m not controlling me
Still them hoes hoes gon’ fall for me
Pussy that they offer me is often not to luxury

But let me see what that lick read
Triple digits in my six speed
Think I fell in love when that bitch hit me
I might fuck around and buss her down and buy a Bentley
For that bitch while you was fuckin’ with them lames I made my baby momma rich

Baby play with my dick not my emotions
Shed so many tears that I could fill an ocean
We was coastin’, now we roller coastin’
Look inside my eyes and feel the pain that you put on me
I just pray to Peep that you don’t leave me lonely
Thousand bitches but they can’t do nothing for me
You my one and only
I know you need some company so come on over
Do you love me, do you love exposure

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Down the fuck you tryna cop my nigga look
Your drip this ain't no robbery
But my bitch is stuck up
She bad as fuck, well like whats in my cup
She [?] im lovin' the way she suck
Ay, she call me J, i call her bae
We ain't the [?]
