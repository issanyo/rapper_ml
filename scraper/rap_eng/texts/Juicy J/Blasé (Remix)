[Intro: Diddy]
Yo, let me get some blue dot in this bitch
Yo, turn off all the muthafuckin lights
It's about to happen
I feel so high right now

[Hook: Future, Ty Dolla $ign & Diddy]
Ordered up a hundred rosés, leave the Benz like blasé, blasé
I’m just, whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
I’m just, blasé, blasé
Ayo, this is the remix, you see me, bitch?
I’m just, blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé, yeah, yeah
Ayo, ayo, don't talk if you can't live that nigga
Ayo, but talk that shit

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign (Diddy)]
Blasé, blasé, blasé, Bombay, Bombay, Bombay
Watch me do my gin face (Ciroc), we been making plenty
Fuck what a nigga say, when he broke anyway
We some young renegades, still taking all fades
Long dreads with the braids, sawed off 12 gauge
Feel like Baby Face Nelson, did a song with Babyface
Bitch I’m reppin' Taylors, bitch I’m reppin' Taylors
All my niggas neighbors, we do no favors
TC got the Backwood, I just roll the papers
I’m just getting paper, I just keep it player
I don’t do no cuffing, I will never save her
I don’t fuck with bacon
Fuck George Bush and Ronald Reagan
I don’t fuck with Donald Trump, he don’t like us
I don’t fuck with snitches, mic’d up
We be in Atlanta and we piped up
You ain’t never seen niggas like us (say what?)
Nigga hitting them licks, fucking your bitch, still with the shit
I’m young and I’m rich, young and I’m rich
I got hoes nigga, I got hoes
In different area codes
I think I’m Nate Dogg

[Hook: Future, Ty Dolla $ign, & Diddy]
Ordered up a hundred rosés, leave the Benz like blasé, blasé
This, is, the remix
I’m just, whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
(Ayo, yeah) I’m just, blasé, blasé
I’m just, blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
(Still getting these ills, still getting these ills)
(Whatever you need we got it, still getting these ills)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé, yeah, yeah
(Yeah nigga, yeah nigga, let's go)

[Interlude: Juicy J (under hook)]
Yessir! Whip, whip, whip, whip
Still making millions, mayne, hey, hey, hey
Still getting these Ms, still getting these Ms
(We ain't going nowhere, bruh)
(Whatever you need, we got it) Still getting these Ms
Yeah, nigga, yeah, nigga, yeah, nigga, yeah, nigga
(Let's get it!)

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Got your chick in my Ferrari, all I hear is blasé, blasé
'Bout to kick her ass out if she ain't down with the menaging
I got icicles all on my belt (yeah)
Being real ain't never felt better (yeah)
I just called my assistant and asked for an update
Money all over my schedule
Blowing kush all into the ozon
With a first class seat with a robe on (mhm)
With a bad little bitch from the projects (yessir)
With a purse full of hydrocodone (always)
I do live on Sundays, I do worse 'fore I go on Mondays (let's go)
I'm a muthafuckin' boss, I got mo' sauce than Pace Picante
Niggas muggin in the club cause they starving
I order a hundred wings then send them niggas a bottle
Tell them, they need a job? Then give me a call tomorrow
Now stop staring at me dawg, you 'bout to upset my shottas
Blaow!

[Hook: Future, Ty Dolla $ign, & Diddy]
Ordered up a hundred rosés, leave the Benz like blasé, blasé
Now if you gon' come in the club, nigga, come in the club
I’m just, whipping Maserati, I'm just (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
If you gon'—If you gon' spend it
Blasé, blasé, I’m just (spend it all, man)
Blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé, I'm just (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Whipping Maserati (skurr, skurr, skurr, skurr)
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, talk to 'em, man

[Interlude: Jeezy (under hook)]
Oh, this the remix right here?
Yeah, I might need, uh, gold bottles
You know how we do, nigga
Ty, what's happening, nigga? YG, what it do?

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
Got that AP, cost a Masi', got my eyes all on Taraji
If I see her, I’ma get her, wouldn’t be right if I weren’t cocky
Kept me spazzing up in Neiman, popping grown nigga tags
Yeah these bitches love a nigga, I got that grown nigga swag
Yeah, big balling in Miami, we screaming, woah, kemosabe
Say I pull up, steal the shine, you fuckin' right, bitch, it's a robbery
Lay it down, lay it down, yeah, you hoes lay it down
Fuck who I want, it's my prerogative, I just went Bobby Brown
Okay, went triple on the styrofoam, champagne off in my cup
Look here, bitch, if you so smart, how 'bout some brains off in my truck?
If they say I’m in the building then you know that bitch is lit
Hey Free TC and free Nito, fuck the blasé, I’m with the shits
Wassup?

[Hook: Future & Ty Dolla $ign (Jeezy/Diddy)]
Ordered up a hundred rosés, need a Benz like blasé, blasé
I’m just, whipping Maserati
(Niggas ain't talking 'bout shit man)
I’m just, blasé, blasé
(Niggas talking to me softly)
(Niggas just talk cause they got lips)
I’m just, blasé, blasé, blasé, blasé
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like blasé, blasé
Ohh, blasé, blasé, blasé, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign (Diddy)]
Alcohol and chronic, yeah, that's all we want

Alcohol and chronic, yeah, that's all we want
(Ay, Ty what was that shit that you had)
Alcohol and chronic, yeah, that's all we want
(What was that sticky stuff that you put on it though?)
Alcohol and chronic, yeah, that's all we want
