[Intro: Juicy J & Baby E.]
Play me some pimpin' man
Uh, uh huh
This one here is for my players
This one here is for my ladies

[Verse 1: Baby E.]
Yeah, french kissin', takin' off expensive lingerie
She be in that kinky [?]
Maybe I should listen what my partner say
She dangerous but I ain't ever been afraid
She puttin' on a show with the big post
Her body super thick and her hair long
If loving is a crime, then I am dead wrong
She get 25 to life if looks was dead wrong
Wake up looking red if all the red poppin'
Got no makeup on but still look like a stylist
One big room, full of bad bitches
'Til you walk up in that bitch, make 'em all look ridiculous to me

[Chorus: Baby E.]
You the baddest bitch in the world, you the baddest bitch in the world
To me
You the baddest bitch in the world, you the baddest bitch in the world
You the baddest bitch in the world, you the baddest bitch in the world
To me
You the baddest bitch in the world, you the baddest bitch in the world

[Verse 2: Baby E.]
She got her own money, she don't need mine
All she really wants is my free time
And I don't have a lot so when I see her
I skip the wine and dinin', start with dessert
She like it rough, she like it nasty
She like it when I'm driving fastly
She's a rockstar, she's a bonafide gangster
And once I met her mother, I knew where it all came from
Pictures of herself with that booty poking out
And the mirror looking sexy sayin', "Papi, come and get me"
When she back that thing up on me, I get lost inside the moment
She's the reason I go hard when I wake up every morning

[Chorus: Baby E.]
You the baddest bitch in the world, you the baddest bitch in the world
To me
You the baddest bitch in the world, you the baddest bitch in the world
You the baddest bitch in the world, you the baddest bitch in the world
To me
You the baddest bitch in the world, you the baddest bitch in the world

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
You love that ho
I gotta get her home, I gotta get her home
Grabbin' thousand dollar weed when she give me dome
Let's dip our chips in Linux, I got plenty bitches
Took that bitch from Wendy's, now all she see is fifty
In the VIP with these shades
I'm touching Hov like I'm Ray
She say she wanna battle, well look just how I play
Durant in the fourth, valet park the Porsche
Face like a diva, ass like a horse
She throwin' that pussy, now I'm in a trance
I beat up that pussy like I'm in a band
Shakin' that ass like an earthquake
I bet she gon' fuck on the first date
Stripper gon' get her funds up, bad bitch on the come up
Throwin' them bands on her, she need help picking these ones up

[Chorus: Baby E.]
You the baddest bitch in the world, you the baddest bitch in the world
To me
You the baddest bitch in the world, you the baddest bitch in the world
You the baddest bitch in the world, you the baddest bitch in the world
To me
You the baddest bitch in the world, you the baddest bitch in the world
