[Intro: 16x]
Mafia

[Hook: Juicy J]
I'm shootin shit up like a dope fiend
Put a hole in your head like a dolphin
I'm putting holes in one, no golfing
Leave his ass dead, where the coffin
I'm shootin shit up like a dope fiend
Put a hole in your head like a dolphin
I'm putting holes in one, no golfing
Leave his ass dead, where the coffin

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Niggas out here ain't real, these niggas ain't tote no straps
These niggas ain't got no work, they just sound good in they raps
They watchin' too many movies, claim he movin' them thangs
Took that nigga in the jail cell; he givin' up names
Rappin' about he in the trap, actin' like he got the sack
Livin' at his momma's house scraping up a nickle bag
Baby ain't got no diapers, his baby ain't got no food
This nigga ain't got no car but he stand in line for shoes
Now he think he bulletproof out here robbin' real niggas
Everybody ain't goin' homie, real niggas gonna deal with ya
Nigga out here lookin' for me - he disappear for about a month
He popped up bout a week ago layin' dead, his momma trunk

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Tehahahaha... uhh
I got so much ice it's like I'm playin' hockey
Smoke so much green nigga, somebody stop me
We in the penthouse, you smell it from the lobby
This ballin's all i know my nigga its not a hobby
Ridin' in my ride reppin Mafia
Never had a chopper Juicy bought me one
Seen niggas with money went and got me some
Nigga see my swag now they copy 'em ...Ooooooo
Nigga I'm ballin smokin' half pound a day, smoke the other in the mornin' ...Ooooooo
Nigga I'm paid got a lot of goons, nigga I'm straight, we reppin' our gang

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Uh-huh; shootin' on site nigga try me if you wanna
Click click bang bang - nigga you a goner
Bullet don't hit ya, it'll put you in a coma
Loud mouth niggas, now you a doner
Whole pint of purp and a lot of marijuana
Chrome'd out 38 hot like the summer
Walk up on you whiskey maskin' punk
And fire them shots just like I'm Donald Trump
Big ass pistol got me walkin' and I'm limpin'
Fuck you and fuck your clique, anybody can get it
Don't do all that talkin', nigga let's shoot to the finish
They won't find your body and I won't leave a witness
{*slowed down*} I'm shootin shit up like a dope fiend {*echoes*}
