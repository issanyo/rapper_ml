[Verse 1: Juicy J]
We done got so high, I can't feel the floor
We can't smoke no mo', we can't pour no mo'
We smoke so much dope, I could be a coach
I be high at church, don't pass me that roach
I get in my feelings every time I pour
Please don't pour no mo', just knocked off a fo'
Purp green, blood red either way it go
Blue Dream, Green Suicide is what I smoke (what I smoke)
Tryna smoke with me you might go broke (you might go broke)
They taxin' you, we get it for the low (for the low)
Smoking half a pound don't do no coke (do no coke)
Pop another xan and then I flow, yeah (yeah)

[Chorus: Juicy J]
We can't smoke no mo', we can't smoke no mo'
We can't smoke no mo' (yeah), we can't smoke no mo'
Please don't pour no mo', please don't pour no mo'
Please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't pour no mo' (yeah)
We can't smoke no mo', We can't smoke no mo'
We can't smoke no mo' (yeah) We can't smoke no mo'
Please don't pour no mo', Please don't pour no mo'
Please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't pour no mo' (yeah)

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
It's Friday, you ain't got no job, you ain't got shit to do
I'ma get you high today, look at my point of view
I must confess to Mary Jane, I'm so in love with you
Can't smoke another blunt, even if I wanted too
You can't overdose on weed and I'm the livin' proof
To understand you gotta know what I be goin' through
You think you know but tell the truth, if you only knew
I light one up right before bed and in the mornin' too
We can't smoke no mo' 'cause we done overdid it (overdid it)
I remember back when we smokin' on that midget (nineties)
We was pourin' up that drink and then I had a vision (yup)
We can run that check up talkin' 'bout the way we livin'

[Chorus: Juicy J]
We can't smoke no mo', we can't smoke no mo'
We can't smoke no mo' (yeah), we can't smoke no mo'
Please don't pour no mo', please don't pour no mo'
Please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't pour no mo (yeah)
We can't smoke no mo', we can't smoke no mo
We can't smoke no mo' (yeah), we can't smoke no mo
Please don't pour no mo', please don't pour no mo
Please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't pour no mo' (yeah)

[Outro: Juicy J]
