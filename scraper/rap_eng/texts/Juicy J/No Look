[Intro]
Ay man, I'ma tell you some real shit
Niggas love ratchet pussy
I'm tellin' you man
Niggas don't be wantin' no good shit man
They like to chase these hoes, spend they money and shit

[Chorus]
Pass that bitch no look
I got Southside cup
I can't heed no looks
Bankroll look like books, bankroll look like books
(books, books, books, books, books)
Pass that bitch no look (no look)
Pass that bitch no look (no look)
Pass that bitch no look
I got Southside cup
I can't heed no looks
Bankroll look like books
Pass that bitch no look
(no look, no look, no look, no look, no look)
Bankroll look like books
Bankroll look like books

[Verse 1]
Me and Pat started in the trap
Showed my niggas how to rap
We was in the studio e'rryday gettin' to it, e'rrbody had them a strap
E'rrbody had them a zip
I was gettin' top in the whip
Butt naked hoes everywhere do a line of that shit now them hoes wanna strip
Used to keep 50 in the clip
Now I get 50 just to sit up in the VIP
Bitch I don't want no lip
'less you finna put it on the tip
I can't find this paper in a book
I get chose by hoes, one look
I get chose, I ain't even been around
That's what we call no look

[Chorus]
Pass that bitch no look
I got Southside cup
I can't heed no looks
Bankroll look like books, bankroll look like books
(books, books, books, books, books)
Pass that bitch no look (no look)
Pass that bitch no look (no look)
Pass that bitch no look
I got Southside cup
I can't heed no looks
Bankroll look like books
Pass that bitch no look
(no look, no look, no look, no look, no look)
Bankroll look like books
Bankroll look like books

[Verse 2]
Bankroll lookin' like a Bible
I be lookin' like a nigga idol everyday
Can't ride my wave like a tidal
Flooded out the Rolly, put the diamonds in the face
No look call me CP
Bitch on me like a glove no GP, (whoa)
She gon' show me love off the [?] (smash)
Played that ho like a motherfuckin' CD
Niggas wanna be me
Then they find out this pimpin' ain't easy
Shoes on 4G's, no 4LTE I'm blessed not holy
I can't trust these bitch ass niggas that be workin' with the police
Shorty come get these nuts in your mouth, then you ride like a pony

[Chorus]
Pass that bitch no look
I got Southside cup
I can't heed no looks
Bankroll look like books, bankroll look like books
(books, books, books, books, books)
Pass that bitch no look (no look)
Pass that bitch no look (no look)
Pass that bitch no look
I got Southside cup
I can't heed no looks
Bankroll look like books
Pass that bitch no look
(no look, no look, no look, no look, no look)
Bankroll look like books
Bankroll look like books
