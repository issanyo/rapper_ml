[Intro]
1 AM, stoner's night
Still blessed to have you here with me
Real shit, so I'm still kicking it

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I do it better than most of these guys
Getting money is the joke to these guys
When you get my type of money, you don't notice them guys
Stay focused on the money or be broke when you die
Niggas know not to be stepping on my situation
You know the top is where I'm head it
I throw money like confetti
Hate the struggle, hate the grind at my nigga basement
Used to hate it on the nigga, cause your fake ass never made it
Real talk, I can’t quit
Hustle till I die, bitch I’m still getting higher than an elevator
Bye bitch, I'm everywhere the cash is
You ain't got no assets
You're a liability to loyalty, now back that
Try to get you niggas game, you had to make a check
But you won't survive if you treat me like your last connect

[Hook: Juicy J]
Luxury flows, I've got luxury flows
Thirty in my grip, that's a luxury roll
Luxury flows, I've got luxury hoes
Luxury flows, I've got luxury clothes
Gucci's on my ass, nine hunned for them hoe
Luxury flows, this the luxury flow
Luxury flows, I've got luxury hoes
Luxury flows, this the luxury flow

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Imma roll me up a J and I'ma face it
Always been real, never had to fake it
If I call her up and meet her she gon take it
All up in her crib, I don't care bout who she datin
And I'm on a ton of weed like I'm Jamaican
White people stare when I walk up to the plane
I got Gs, I got dough
I've got keys to the Rolls
I got KK by the O

[Hook: Juicy J]
Luxury flows, I've got luxury flows
Thirty it in my grip, that's a luxury roll
Luxury flows, I've got luxury hoes
Luxury flows, I've got luxury clothes
Gucci's on my ass, nine hunned for them hoe
Luxury flows, this the luxury flow
Luxury flows, I've got luxury hoes
Luxury flows, this the luxury flow

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Gucci's on my ass 900 for them hoes
Luxury flow this that luxury flow
Luxury flow, I've got luxury hoes
Luxury flows, this the luxury flow
If you don't wake up with that "get money" feeling
You a lazy ass broke bitch nigga with no vision
I be spitting dope to niggas OD on prescription
Bought the Bentley off the lot in some damn slippers
I got neighbors on my ass cause i'm smoking to much gas
My accountant keeping tabs
20 bags full of cash
Spent 250 on the watch to make most of my time
It ain't no second for bitches who don't fuck to survive
Came up from the mud to a solid gold tub
Had to struggle, had to grind, had to dedicate my time nigga

[Hook: Juicy J]
Luxury flows, I've got luxury flows
Thirty it in my grip, that's a luxury roll
Luxury flows, I've got luxury hoes
Luxury flows, I've got luxury clothes
Gucci's on my ass, nine hunned for them hoe
Luxury flows, this the luxury flow
Luxury flows, I've got luxury hoes
Luxury flows, this the luxury flow

[Verse 4 Juicy J]
They hatin' on me they don’t want to let me be great
I been in the driveway thirty minutes straight
Interrupted by some bullshit, I just want this cake
Took a jet to New York and back for some cheesecake
When you got this type of money ain’t no demonstration
If you selling real estate or you in the kitchen
My heads high and my nose in the sky
With a Peruvian bitch on her knees right now (bitch!)
You gon' drink this sauce if you drip nut on this rug you ain’t built to fuck a boss!

[Hook: Juicy J]
Luxury flows, I've got luxury flows
Thirty it in my grip, that's a luxury roll
Luxury flows, I've got luxury hoes
Luxury flows, I've got luxury clothes
Gucci's on my ass, nine hunned for them hoe
Luxury flows, this the luxury flow
Luxury flows, I've got luxury hoes
Luxury flows, this the luxury flow

[Outro: Juicy J]
I do it better than most of these guys
Getting money is a joke to these guys
When you getting my type of money you don't notice them guys
Stay focused on the money or be broke or you die
