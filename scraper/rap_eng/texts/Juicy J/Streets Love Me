[Intro: Juicy J]
Purpp what's good mane?

[Hook: SmokePurpp]
Momma told me, boy stay out the streets don't be your pops
Came in with the mag just like a pussy let it pop
Momma told me, boy stay out the streets cause you get popped
Told my mom I'm sorry, I'm the one who sendin' shots
I can't leave the streets, cause the streets love me
I can't leave the streets, cause the streets love me
I can't leave the streets, cause the streets love me
I can't leave the streets, cause the streets love me

[Verse 1: SmokePurpp]
I can't leave the streets, bitch I love the beef
I like robbin' cars, I'm a fuckin' thief
Diamonds on my teeth
Milly rockin' through the streets
Drink a pint a day, run, run through four like every week
Lil Purpp, Lil Purrp, Lil Purrp pop five xans it's cool
Lil Purpp, Lil Purrp, Lil Purrp diamonds wet like pool
Came in with the work, pussy niggas talkin' he can get murked
Niggas sayin' that they lookin for me I'ma put his ass on a shirt

[Hook: SmokePurpp & Juicy J]
Momma told me, boy stay out the streets don't be your pops
Came in with the mag just like a pussy let it pop
Momma told me, boy stay out the streets cause you get popped
Told my momma I'm sorry, I'm the one who sendin' shots
I can't leave the streets, cause the streets love me
I can't leave the streets, cause the streets love me
I can't leave the streets, cause the streets love me
I can't leave the streets, cause the streets love me (Yeah hoe!)

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Momma told me I should go to school and get a job
But instead I went and got some work, now I'm in charge
Spendin' money, livin' large, half a mill' in my garage
Bitches want a menage, my ex wanna sabotage (fuck that hoe)
Sippin' clean but the cup muddy, it's blood up in my pop
That mop stick in that drop bit', you gon' fuck around and get popped
I'm the one that call plays, I'm the one that sendin' shots
I'm the one that set the streets on fire, you ain't never been hot, no (you cold)
I can't leave the streets cause I feed the streets
My niggas need to eat where the cake, we need a piece
I'm hot, I'm off the shit no pancakes, I got syrup nigga
Them Benjamin's in the back of the Brinks like it's a hearse nigga

[Hook: SmokePurpp]
Momma told me, boy stay out the streets don't be your pops
Came in with the mag just like a pussy let it pop
Momma told me, boy stay out the streets cause you get popped
Told my momma I'm sorry, I'm the one who sendin' shots
I can't leave the streets, cause the streets love me
I can't leave the streets, cause the streets love me
I can't leave the streets, cause the streets love me
I can't leave the streets, cause the streets love me
