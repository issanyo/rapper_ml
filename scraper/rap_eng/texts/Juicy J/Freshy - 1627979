High price my cloth, overprice my hoes
New hoes, no fisc
Make account, lot of chips
Get brain your bitch
She loves lot of cash
Going broke ain’t an option
If I want it I'mma have it
Hundred K, that’s nothing
Everybody talking money
Talking chips, that’s done
Start the car, push button
Get trippy, pop pills
White girls, snow cold
I do it for the cash, for the drugs, not a ho
Nigga safe when I swear past
Get a bad bitch with a burkon bag
With a drug habbit, just roll the hash
In the strip club throwing cash
In here trapped out, money machine go beep
In here racked out, counting bands off in my sleep
