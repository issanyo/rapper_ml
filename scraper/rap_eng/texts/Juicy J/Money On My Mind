[Chorus: Juicy J]
I just need another bitch (hey, hey)
I just need y'all niggas off my fucking dick
I just need to get money (get money)
I just need to get money (run tune, my lord)
I just need another whip, 'nother crib ('nother crib)
I just need another mill' ('nother mill', 'nother mill')
Money on my mind (I've got money on my mind)
Money on my mind (yeah)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Juicy J, yo
Money on my mind, my paper look like a Smurf
Bought myself a new Rollie and bought my bitch a new vert
She keep my weed in her purse, I keep my hand up her skirt
Mo' money, mo' problems, it's a gift and a curse
You know that top where I'm stayin'
I'm 'bout to cop me a planet
A whole pound of moon rocks, I'm high as a tube sock
My cash in a shoe box, just bought me a new spot
My lil' chick don't cook or clean, all she wanna do is shop (yeah, ho)

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I just need another bitch
I just need y'all niggas off my fucking dick
I just need to get money
I just need to get money

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Cash all money, count it all day
Don't even think of takin' no breaks
Got guns long as pool sticks
Nigga, don't even think of playin' with the K
Don't even think of playin' with a G
That blower leave you laying in the street
Get your head a thousand miles away
I'm with my chick laying on the beach
A hater can't stand too close
Gotta keep your distance
Nigga, pay attention
When the money talk, listen
All my shit paid for, homie
Count it up everyday
Rich nigga, I don't lease shit
That's too much like a layaway (yeah, ho)

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I just need another bitch
I just need y'all niggas off my fucking dick
I just need to get money
I just need to get money (bitch)
I just need another whip, 'nother crib
I just need another mill'
Money on my mind
Money on my mind (yeah, ho)

[Interlude]
I just wanna get money
I got money on my mind (I just wanna get money)
[?]
Turn it up one time

[Bridge: Juicy J]
Money on my mind
Goddamn it, I can shake it
Money on my mind
Mon-, money on my mind
Money on my mind
Goddamn it, I can shake it
Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Money on my mind
Goddamn it, I can shake it
Money on my mind
Mon-, money on my mind
Money on my mind
Goddamn it, I can shake it
Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Money on my mind
Goddamn it, I can shake it
Money on my mind
Mon-, money on my mind
Money on my mind
Goddamn it, I can shake it
Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind

[Outro: Juicy J]
Juicy J, yo (get money)
