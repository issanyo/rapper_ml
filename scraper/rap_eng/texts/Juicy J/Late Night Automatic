She's my
My late night automatic
Automatic
One call automatic
Now she's coming automatic

We in the club
We on patron
We in the VIP doin wrong
Like michael phelps it was me on the bong
Call in my state
This is me on the phone
I want to get with her
And sip a little liquor
I try to come down from all these spinners
Yeah she's the one, she can make the booty wiggle
She from pittsburg and her body as a winner

I love me a girl that can deal with this here
That can walk
That can ride
That can drive, that can steer
That can dance
That can dip
That can move through your hair
Brake it down to the floor
Take a shot
Drink a beer

There's a weight on my car
Just to get them jars
On the roof
On the roof
On the beer
On the wall
Like that's mess mane
Just a chain, I'm a dog
Like that's mess mane
I'm a fiend, want it all

She's my
My late night automatic
Automatic
One call automatic
Now she's coming automatic (2x)

Ain't nothin fresh about the studio
Darker than a fish
Who should I, who should I, who should I hit
Up on the tell her, tell her what time it is
And see who down and gon' roll by the crib
Ain't nothin better than a late night tip
Or a day time tip
Or a anytime tip
Best part about it, she ain't even got a tip
She ain't gotta hand out
She ain't on that trip
But she down for it all
She ain't never scared
Ten feet from ya, boy like concierge
Anytime I'm in me, she gonna be there
No if's, no and's, no but's, let's jam
Just like that, she down like that
Got my back like that, from the back like that
She stank like that, super fine like that
Breasts and hips and thighs like that

She's my
My late night automatic
Automatic
One call automatic
Now she's coming automatic (2x)

She stays home
And there's nothin at all
She waits until i hear the baby
And then it's on
And she's not ashamed
To be the for the child
She's my, my late night
Call her my late night

She's my
My late night automatic
Automatic
One call automatic
Now she's coming automatic (2x)
