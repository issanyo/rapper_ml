[Hook: Lil Twist]
(U-F-O, U-F-O)
When I pull up on the block they like what the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that? What the fuck is that?
(U-F-O, U-F-O)
I leave them crop circles, they like what the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that? What the fuck is that?

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
Break it to the floor
Push the button, go
Smoked up all them swishers
Peel out to the store
Run up all the kush, cop another O
Bumping Juicy J, saying "yeah ho"
Yeah ho, my rings is shiny ho
48 inches, can get no higher ho
Lay yo head in my lap, while I hear the clown ho
Teleport to the posse, can't get no flyer ho
I'm in that

(U-F-O, U-F-O)
When I pull up on the block they like what the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that? What the fuck is that?
(U-F-O, U-F-O)
I leave them crop circles, they like what the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that? What the fuck is that?

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Pull up on you and your Mrs
All black with the windows tinted
Damn right, it's big pimping
This whip don't come out 'till 2012
Snatch yo bitch, don't spend a penny
Tomorrow I give her back
Tonight she my little groupie hoe, I'm in her mouth like blaat
Yo baby momma too basic, she in my hotel wasted
Bitch I'm higher than a UFO and my car look like a space ship
So much money, it don't make sense
In a strip club, I pay rent
Freaky bitch, I'm Juicy J
Shoot my kids in your mouth make you babysit 'em
Me and my homie Lil Twist
We go back to back on yo bitch
Taylor Gang and Young Money, this a night she'll never forget
We turning up and we never turning down
It's some shoes you can't afford and a car you can't pronounce
