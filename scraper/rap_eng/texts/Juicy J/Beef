What's beef?
Beef is when them niggas on the corner watching me
Beef is when them bad bitches talking in the streets
Beef is when a nigga owe you money and he lying, he gon' pay you next week
What's beef?
Beef is when that nigga come up short
And claim some niggas robbed his ass for it, haha
What's beef?
Beef is when your baby call the feds
Cause you didn't buy that bitch no Birkin bag
Nigga what's beef?

[Verse 1]
Hahahaha, check out this bizarre
Brand new style used by me the Juicy J
I could make a million dollars in a day
Money over bitches every way
You can't trust none of these hoes
You can't fuck none of these hoes
You can't reply to their twitter, these bitches out of control
I put my gun on my money and what I made
Niggas plotting on me to make a play
Let us pray
Dear father, dear father
I don't know what I'ma do to these niggas that's watching on me
Forgive me lord, forgive me lord
For anybody that I body and put in a mole

What's beef?
Beef is when 150 niggas on the street
Waiting for your ass to come home
What's beef?
Beef is when you tryna fuck your connect
Now they want your head for a check nigga
Tell me what's beef?
Beef is when them niggas on the corner watching me
Beef is when them bad bitches talking in the streets
Beef is when a nigga owe you money and he lying, he gon' pay you next week
What's beef?
Beef is when that nigga come up short
And claim some niggas robbed his ass for it, haha
What's beef?
Beef is when your baby call the feds
Cause you didn't buy that bitch no Birkin bag
Nigga what's beef?

[Verse 2]
Rolling with some killers, rolling with some hitters
Rolling with some niggas, you the one they 'bout to blast
I done smoked with the rest of 'em
Shot at the best of 'em
Fucked rich bitches up north, I'm finessing 'em
It's all about the money for sure nigga [?]
I ain't work this hard for no motherfucking loss
I walk up in this bitch, smelling like a [?]
You ain't got no heart to fuck with anybody more
The last nigga I let hold something stole something
I gave my homie 10 stacks, told 'em go and get 'em
He ran up in your house, he under the couch
And when you got comfortable, he put his gun in your mouth

[Hook]
What's beef?
Beef is when the streets is never sleep
And niggas catch a fucking energy, close range
What's beef?
Beef is when you die before you need to
Nigga cause the game ain't really need you
