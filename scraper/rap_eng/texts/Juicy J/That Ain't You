[Intro]
Niggas play them games
Now they can't come back outside
Runnin' off, jumpin' niggas gate
Then run and hide (get him!)
You can't get no work
Nigga how you gon' survive? (you know it!)
Bringing drama to your mama house
You need to die

[Chorus]
Nigga we know that ain't you
Nigga that ain't what you do
We already know that you food
We already know you ain't true
Runnin' off with niggas work
That type of shit get you murk
You gon' end up in a church
You gon' end up on a shirt
Nigga we know that ain't you
Nigga that ain't what you do
We already know that you food (you food!)
We already know you ain't true (you ain't true!)
Runnin' off with these lil hoes
That shit it get you exposed (fuck these bitches!)
You gon' end up with no dough
You will end up in a hole

[Verse 1]
You welcome to hustle and serve
That's if you keepin' your word
If you run off with them packs
You gon' get what you deserve
Say you can handle them bricks
Say you be flipping them birds
If you don't come back with the shit
Them niggas is ready to purge (purge!)
Just want to give up some game
For niggas that's acting like they in a gang (gang!)
You gotta crawl, before you walk
Learn how to get you some change (change!)
You should be grateful you able to eat
Don't worry 'bout making a name (don't worry!)
Steady yourself and stay in your lane
Or you just might end up a stain
That ain't no â€˜scuse to the plug
You wan't the money or drugs
You the one ask for the flood
In this game it ain't no love
Niggas gon' get it in blood
Nigga get that understood
I got that shit out the mud
I represent for the hood
Look at me now, bitch I'm good
I'm doing shit they said I never could (bitch!)

[Chorus]
Nigga we know that ain't you
Nigga that ain't what you do
We already know that you food
We already know you ain't true (you ain't true!)
Runnin' off with niggas work
That type of shit get you murk
You gon' end up in a church
You gon' end up on a shirt (on a shirt!)
Nigga we know that ain't you
Nigga that ain't what you do
We already know that you food
We already know you ain't true
Runnin' off with these lil hoes
That shit it get you exposed
You gon' end up with no dough
You will end up in a hole (verse 2!)

[Verse 2]
I think these niggas be living to die
Like that's what they bang for
You said you never had no other option
Then you should go make you a chain bro
You scared? Then get out the game bro
'Cause niggas might blow out your brains bro
Nobody remember your name bro
Just a victim of sayin' you gang bro
Nobody gon' tell you the truth, I am the proof
There's other shit you can do
Bitches like niggas with money
That's all that matter, it don't matter what you do
You could be fresh or be bummy
If you got a sack, I bet that bitch coming through
Most of these niggas is food, ain't nothing new
Under the sun and that's true
Fuck IG, get a bag, most of these hoes is strag (strag nigga!)
They sellin' that shit for the low
You think them hoes is bad? (they ain't bad nigga!)
You thinking 'bout wifing a hoe
That niggas not already had? (haha!)
You put that bitch in a glow
You shoulda put that in the trash (bitch!)
Nigga we know that ain't you
