[Intro: Project Pat]
Pat'aaaahh!
Mayne you niggas know what it is
Nigga you didn't hear the motherfuckin' choppa?
You niggas don't gonna do nothin' but curl up like a motherfuckin' beetle bug, kna'msayen?
Like a roly poly nigga. Yee ain't do shit, get your monkey ass out the way. Get your ass murked!

[Hook]
When you hear that choppa
You gon' lay it down, you gon' lay it down
You gon' lay it down
When you hear that choppa
Get yo head down, get yo head down
Get yo head down

When you hear that choppa
You gon' lay it down, you gon' lay it down
You gon' lay it down
When you hear that choppa
Get yo head down, get yo head down
Get yo head down

[Verse 1]
My lil homie keep a choppa on 'em
17, he already got some bodies on 'em
He ran off on his plug, hit the lotto on 'em
You can't tell a nigga shit, you can't stop the homie
Now he out here like he can't be touched
He the youngest nigga out here buying bottles in the club
Throwing money on the strippers
If he fight, he pull them pistols
On a hand full of drugs with a whole gang of niggas
Living so fast, don't get in his way
He ain't even 18, got 2 babies on the way
They say lil homie got the juice, that's the word around town
Caught him coming out the barber shop, the plug hunt him down

[Hook]
When you hear that choppa
You gon' lay it down, you gon' lay it down
You gon' lay it down
When you hear that choppa
Get yo head down, get yo head down
Get yo head down

When you hear that choppa
You gon' lay it down, you gon' lay it down
You gon' lay it down
When you hear that choppa
Get yo head down, get yo head down
Get yo head down

[Verse 2]
You ain't got nothing for me
You don't get nothing for free
Choppa just like the police
Imagine what I do with beef
Catch
Pick him right out of my teeth
My niggas is eating with me
They off the leash, you dealing with beasts
You say it's a struggle to you, really it's nothing to me
Bitches be fucking for free
Falling in love with the d
Falling in love with the fact all for nothing and nothing is fucking with me
Bullets gon' grind you, don't never say nothing and be right back out on the street
Came here from nothing to something, if you don't want nothing, your nothing to me
Plus I got nothing but love for the millions, the niggas who hating on me
Hop in my whip and pull off on niggas, my bitches is waiting on me
I got them choppas for niggas who thinking that they wanna take some from me

[Hook]
When you hear that choppa
You gon' lay it down, you gon' lay it down
You gon' lay it down
When you hear that choppa
Get yo head down, get yo head down
Get yo head down

When you hear that choppa
You gon' lay it down, you gon' lay it down
You gon' lay it down
When you hear that choppa
Get yo head down, get yo head down
Get yo head down
