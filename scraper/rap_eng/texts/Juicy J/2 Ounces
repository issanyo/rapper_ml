[Hook: YKOM]
Two ounces in, I need a cup of liquor
Stop at V live, throw a house load at a stripper
Sitting in the coup, I can't lie I'm feeling faded
I know I'm the greatest, most these rappers overrated
Two ounces in, I need a cup of liquor
Stop at V live, throw a house load at a stripper
Sitting in the coup, I can't lie I'm feeling faded
I know I'm the greatest, most these rappers overrated
Two ounces in, I need a cup of liquor
Stop at V live, throw a house load at a stripper
Sitting in the coup, I can't lie I'm feeling faded
I know I'm the greatest, most these rappers overrated

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Cup of that Dussé, cup of circoc, a cup of that drank
Yeah a cup of that too
Pull up looking like money a v-line
Probably in the coup, prolly hopping out the roof
Nigga I'm a OG smoking on OG
Fucked your OG and her crew
I'm just the greatest
You just the latest
They overrated, yeah that's true
Pouring up all night, we faded
But nigga watch this, all white
She wanna dance on me all night
I hit that one time never call back
[?]
You can't hang, you get booted
Nigga, I do this
You came up, on a nuttin' but foo' shit (foo' foo')
Poppin' that ace, that's rosé (rosé)
Tell Don pass that Péri-ay (pass it)
I puff, smoke city all day (all day)
Getting money, getting to it all day
Northside, northside, northside
Feeling like a fiend in the hallway
I was in the field since a lil nigga
Now I'm the boss, I can plays

[Hook: YKOM]
Two ounces in, I need a cup of liquor

Sitting in the coup, I can't lie I'm feeling faded
I know I'm the greatest, most these rappers overrated
Two ounces in, I need a cup of liquor
Stop it at V live, throw a half load at a stripper
Sitting in the coup, I can't lie I'm feeling faded
I know I'm the greatest, most these rappers overrated
Two ounces in, I need a cup of liquor
Stop it at V live, throw a house load at a stripper
Sitting in the coup, I can't lie I'm feeling faded
I know I'm the greatest, most these rappers overrated

[Verse 2: YKOM]
I'm bout' to make this a monument
And everything I done is [?] and shit
I'm still balling with the scholarships
And I never needed acknowledgement
I start a movie, you just got a flick
Young king want me politic
See I'm about to show them what product is
Still ballin', that's what I done says
I'm with the motion, never losing focus
If he diss me then I wouldn't notice
I'm just tryna let them know that I be on it no emotion and try to kill all the opponents
Yeah, yeah that's what he says
Regardless, it's off with you head
I'm OBG but I'm fed
I'm leaving them all with the red
I had to come through with like I'm Dapper Dan
On the green and yellow like a packer fan
If I leave the beach, I gotta pack the sand
Lot a junk behind me like a moving fan
I don't think I understand
Came in this bitch like the greatest
You know I been pushing the ladies

[Hook: YKOM]
Two ounces in, I need a cup of liquor
