[Intro]
Yeah, mafia
Real shit, real spit
Yeah, mafia

[Chorus]
The real gon' outlast the fake
The money gon' outlast the hate
Got niggas in the system, tryna dodge the State
I'm out here in the jungle, tryna dodge the snakes
I can see 'em from a mile away
I'm just a nigga from around the way
Like a fat kid, I need all the cake
I'm out here in the jungle, tryna dodge the snakes

[Verse 1]
I'm that nigga doe, and they know
Ridin' with the straps since they say they blow (you know it)
If niggas wanna diss, then I know they broke
Niggas actin' like they street until they get exposed
Niggas givin' statements, snitching on they bros
All these niggas hate, 'cause they can't get they own
They throw dirt all on my name, then they say, "Put me on"
They won't realize I'm the realest 'til the day I'm gone
I hope you know, nigga

[Chorus]
The real gon' outlast the fake
The money gon' outlast the hate
Got niggas in the system, tryna dodge the State
I'm out here in the jungle, tryna dodge the snakes
I can see 'em from a mile away
I'm just a nigga from around the way
Like a fat kid, I need all the cake
I'm out here in the jungle, tryna dodge the snakes

[Verse 2]
Niggas couldn't come to Memphis 'til they got a pass, nigga
I will take the check, but I really want the cash, nigga
A pound worth of greens, zoo sitting in the stash, nigga
We ain't pulling over for the blue, we do the dash, nigga
All that fake shit niggas on, come to pass
All the real shit I do, the reason why I laugh
Don't be playing games with the brain, I'm on your ass
Put the chrome to your dome, nigga have a blast
