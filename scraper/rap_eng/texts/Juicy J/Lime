Benji, Benji, Benji

[Chorus]
Pull up on that bitch, on my neck so shine
When I'm on the road, baby, hit my line
If I can bang you with these seats so lime (seats so lime)
Pull up on that bitch, on my neck so shine
When I'm on the road, baby, hit my line
If I can bang you with these seats so lime (seats so lime)

[Verse 1]
Seats are lime, beats are cool, then I drop the roof
And you, you know what I wanna do
Smoke this green before my school, school, school, school, school
Teachers always tryna call mama when she working too
Now we swimming in these jewels (damn)
Swimming in these jewels, ?
Never pulled up on that day, like who new?
Three in the corner ?

[Pre-Chorus]
Damn, girl, I still think of you
Does he, does he fuck you like I do?
Damn, girl, I still think of you
(With all the shit that we've been through)

[Chorus]
Pull up on that bitch, on my neck so shine
When I'm on the road, baby, hit my line
If I can bang you with these seats so lime (seats so lime)
Pull up on that bitch, on my neck so shine
When I'm on the road, baby, hit my line
If I can bang you with these seats so lime (seats so lime)

[Verse 2]
Sunday night, it's a vibe, it was quarter to the 5
Call me up and she was down, so I put that shit in drive
Scuba dive, I was deep with these Louis' on my feet
Then her man, he called her up
I said 'damn, your bitch with me'
So he skrrt up in his car, finna find out where we be
You won't find us, little boy
We got money, don't you see?
Put your glasses on (damn)
She finesse you ?
Trippin, sippin on, put your glasses on

[Pre-Chorus]
Damn, girl, I still think of you
Does he, does he fuck you like I do?
Damn, girl, I still think of you
(With all the shit that we've been through)

[Chorus]
Pull up on that bitch, on my neck so shine
When I'm on the road, baby, hit my line
If I can bang you with these seats so lime (seats so lime)
Pull up on that bitch, on my neck so shine
When I'm on the road, baby, hit my line
If I can bang you with these seats so lime (seats so lime)

[Outro]
Put your glasses on (damn)
Trippin, sippin on (ooh)
Put your glasses on (damn)
Trippin, sippin on (ooh)
