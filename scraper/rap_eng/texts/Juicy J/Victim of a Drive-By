[Intro]
Here comes the pain!

[Hook]
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
(pop pop 'till you drop, bre-break, bre-bre-break)
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
(pop pop 'till you drop, body full of bullet holes)
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
(pop pop 'till you drop, bre-break, bre-bre-break)
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
(pop pop 'till you drop, body full of bullet holes)

[Verse 1: Lil Glock]
Hangin' out the window holdin' tight to my murder weapon
Hit the lights, creep up slow, bullet lead catch ya lil ass slippin'
Glock poppin' bustas droppin' niggas duckin' from this shit
Mask on my face no description of who made this hit
Bitches thinkin' "who was it?", bitch it was triple six
Devil thoughts, evil thoughts, trizzick bitches I just clizzick
Plenty of blood, no suspects, only victims laying dead
Shells laying in their body's, it's the fucking bullet lead
Now niggas in the morgue and I could give a fuck less
Keep my business quiet as kept, mothers in that black dress
Headed back to my fuckin' hood, project born, ridge grove
Hustla' raised gangsta' raised business up in dirty coast
Now sorry you're the one got me reachin' for my hip
No friends in the game in the spot victim of my clip
Fuck all you bustas' step and you're gonna die
Comin' at yo' ass victim of a fuckin' drive by

[Hook]
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
(pop pop 'till you drop, bre-break, bre-bre-break)
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
(pop pop 'till you drop, body full of bullet holes)
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
(pop pop 'till you drop, bre-break, bre-bre-break)
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
(pop pop 'till you drop, body full of bullet holes)

[Verse 2: SOG]
Straight from the North bitch, ridge grove is my stomping ground
You niggas don't make a move, you bitches don't make a sound
Sawed-off gangsta' and nigga Glock back in for the 94'
Tellin' all you punk bustas man, bring that shit to the door
I'm able, unfadable no nigga' can fuck with this
You talk all that bullshit to yo' mouth goes my fuckin' fist
I'm jackin' 5000 bitch so go home and get yo' gat
You better take cover ho cause this shit is on like that
Squeezin' my fuckin' trigger blastin' to take yo' life
Your niggas done got all down so you have to pay the price
Jumped in the fuckin' ride loced up like from head to toe
I pulled out a sack of ink rolled up as we start to blow
My gat is tight in my hand it's too late to break and run
My bullets ejected bitch got shot down by teflons
On a spree, killin' see, welcome to the evil side
It's too late to run bitch, victim of a drive by

[Hook]
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
(pop pop 'till you drop, bre-break, bre-bre-break)
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
(pop pop 'till you drop, body full of bullet holes)
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
(pop pop 'till you drop, bre-break, bre-bre-break)
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
(pop pop 'till you drop, body full of bullet holes)
