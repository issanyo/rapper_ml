[Intro: Jay IDK]
I put the juice in the vodka then I mix it all up (up up up up)
I don't give a fuck who's gonna drive after the club (club club club club)

[Verse 1: Jay IDK]
It's Friday ho
I need a shot
Just failed my English class
So English class is getting dropped
It's a
Frat party so you know these hoes about to pop
And you know these hoes be holy hoes
When we up in the spot
I am a paper chasing nigga
Paper chasing nigga
But I don't do papers chasin’ figures
Papers chasin’ figures
Fuck school
For now at least
Cause right now I just wanna get so high, that I slur my speech
Get freaked by a little freak
Then I take her home to the dorm room
While her roommate sleep
That's college life for that ass
Pour a little jungle juice in that glass
I ain't come to go to damn class
Bitch
I came to school to have a blast
Shit
I smoke the weed and then I pass it
The opposite of my classes
If you don't see that I don't give a shit
Then your ass may need a pair of glasses

[Pre-Hook: Jay IDK]
I'm inside of a cloud from all the silent loud
We put our drinks to these sky
And then we file it down
And when we finish the drink
We drive on to a canal
Of more liquor cause I ain't trying to remember

[Chorus: Jay IDK]
I put the juice in the vodka then I mix it all up
I don't give a fuck who's gonna drive after the club
Forget all your problems
Tomorrow ain't promised
Get fucked up's what I want
So fuck it I'm on one
I'm a Party Animal
Party Animal
(Whoof)
Party Animal
Party Animal
(Whoof Whoof)
Party Animal
Party Animal
(Whoof)
Party Animal
Party Animal
(Whoof Whoof)

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Juicy been a boss
Any bitch I toss
Smokin weed and sippin lean in public fuck the law
Riding in a Lamborghini
Creamy white like fettuccine
With a bitch rollin’ greenie
And on my head like a beanie
I keep a hustle work my muscle
I will never struggle
If one job ain't enough, my nigga, I will work a double
Let's have some fun, put a Molly on her tongue
Got a girl
Plus a girl
It's ‘bout to be a threesome
Throwing money with my people
Smoking weed like its legal
You niggas be out here smoke regular, all I blow is diesel
20 years I'm still standin’
Still wiling out like Nick Cannon
20 hoes nigga in my mansion
Old money like Richard Branson

[Pre-hook: Jay IDK]
I'm inside of a cloud from all the silent loud
We put our drinks to the sky
And then we file it down
And when we finish the drink
We drive on to a canal
Of more liquor cause it make me fuck her quicker

[Chorus]
