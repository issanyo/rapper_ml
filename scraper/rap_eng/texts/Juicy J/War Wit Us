[Hook - repeat 4x]
Do ya'll niggas want a war wit us
Do ya'll niggas want to get your head bust
I see them yorks in the sky raise em high raise em high
I see them tones in the sky raise em high raise em high

[Juicy J]
Yeah every time I flip the script
Niggas always talkin' shit
Mad because the cards I flip
Maybe he be struckin' wit
I think he used to slang them rocks
Set up shop on this here block
Orange Blossom apartment three
Niggas ain't even know me
Young and buck just full of beer
Drinking out my nigga Clair
Death is like we never fear
Even if we know it's near
Stealing cars and rollin dice
Trying to dodge the Memphis vice
I'm telling all you young niggas
In this game there ain't no life
Mom told me to stay in school
All I did was break the rules
Pop was preaching the word of God
I was busy actin' a fool
Mad with a fuckin' mug
Loadin' up my .38 slug
Head spinnin' from the killing
And through my blood ain't nothin' but drugs

[Crunchy Blac]
Do ya'll niggas want a war wit us
Do ya'll niggas want a war wit us
In gats we trust
In heads we bust
See niggas like us
Uh uh we can't be trust
We come to your crib
I mean we come to your house
We knock on your door
We put the gun in your mouth
We throw our sets
No disrespect
All we want is money nigga
Can you niggas get met
No game I play
Wit none of you hoes
Like the one in the chamber
Puttin' bodies in holes

Hook
