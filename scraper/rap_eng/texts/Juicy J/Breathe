[Hook: Juicy J]
They don't wanna see us up, they just wanna lock us all down
And we tell em let us go, but they just wanna see us on our legs
We just tryna get some money
Let us breathe, let us breathe, let us breathe
We just tryna feed our family
Let us breathe, let us breathe, let us breathe

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
They gunning niggas down on the street
People scared to call the police so they copping up some heat
We ain't scared of going to jail, we ain't hiding from police
They don't give a fuck about us, dropping bodies on TV
Black man on arm, shot down in black Jordan 1's
They got this shit on tape, they go to trial they won
We can't catch a break, I pray to god with my chopp
Just to keep some faith, I pray the angels is watching
I feel like we the target and who the hell is safe
When the neighborhood watch poking out taking shots
Niggas caught with the work, they get 40 years
Cops killing left and right, they get no years

[Hook: Juicy J]
They don't wanna see us up, they just wanna lock us all down
And we tell em let us go, but they just wanna see us on our legs
We just tryna get some money
Let us breathe, let us breathe, let us breathe
We just tryna feed our family
Let us breathe, let us breathe, let us breathe

[Verse 2: GOD]
Uh, I just been trying to get paid
I'm trying to find different ways
We ain't been able to breathe since back in the days when we was all slaves
I used to answer the [?]
Now [?]
I'm bout to take them to church, get hit with the verse
You gonna think I'm a pastor
Revelation or the revolution
They can't hold us with a prosecution
I'm a rolling nigga in my institution
I'ma school em all on a new solution
If they haters then let em hate
Cause they gonna hate on us anyways
They wanna lock us in the petition
When they let us out we gonna penetrate
Pay attention let me demonstrate
Police hop out, gun in my face
Hands up, I ain't got it on me, I have it on me any other day
But I had a bag of loud on me, some shit I had from the other day
I took off and tried to run, he shot me in my back tryna get away

[Hook: Juicy J]
They don't wanna see us up, they just wanna lock us all down
And we tell em let us go, but they just wanna see us on our legs
We just tryna get some money
Let us breathe, let us breathe, let us breathe
We just tryna feed our family
Let us breathe, let us breathe, let us breathe

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
I got a lot of people I ride for
People I die for
Real niggas never change
After all the pain in the game
I done lost so many niggas I forgot who I cry for
Damn shame change
Memphis ain't change
Everywhere in the world, the hood is the same
Racist police, niggas killin' niggas
Drug wars, makin' millions
Hustle to survive, we don't know no difference
Imagine being us, out here no one to trust
Every time I hear the news, another nigga in the dust
Prosecute his work, to keep us all in that bus
All in them trains til somebody turn state witness
And fuck up the game
