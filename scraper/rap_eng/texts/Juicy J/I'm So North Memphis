[Intro]
North Memphis, North Memphis
North Memphis, North Memphis

[Chorus]
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I still hit the corner store
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I still fuck my old hoes
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I rob your ass in broad day
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I got the AK in the Wraith
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I still hit the corner store
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I still fuck my old hoes
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I rob your ass in broad day
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I got the AK in the Wraith

[Verse 1]
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I still ride with the strap
Point that bitch in your direction, watch how fast your run a lap
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I promise I ain't had no sleep
I been grinding overtime to make sure all my niggas eat
I'm so North Memphis nigga, I still talk on burner phones
I know I'ma star but I still have them goons outside your home
I'm so North Memphis, you can tell even though I'm rich
Gangster nigga, I eat fried chicken on my private jet
I'm from North Memphis, where they steal
Where they kill, where a nigga gotta get it how they live
Where they don't rap but they got deals
Where they find you in a ditch if you squeal
Get time then .45 peel
Where the niggas in the streets and the hoes gonna pose
And they all just tryna pay bills

[Chorus]
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I still hit the corner store
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I still fuck my old hoes
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I rob your ass in broad day
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I got the AK in the Wraith
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I still hit the corner store
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I still fuck my old hoes
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I rob your ass in broad day
I'm so North Memphis bitch, I got the AK in the Wraith

[Verse 2]
I'm so North Memphis bitch, excuse me if I'm not on time
Boy, my Rollie flooded try to the check the time most went blind
I'm so North Memphis, straight from Hollywood to London
I'm still hood even with money, get my cars, wash my junkies
I'm from North Memphis, I'm bout to roll through the hood in Tesla
Got so much money, I even got extra
Weed, pills, drank that's tri-factor
I'm from the hustle, you know where to find me
I'm fresh to death but a nigga still grimey
So fucking ghetto sorry but not sorry
Still shooting dice in a hotel lobby, bitch
