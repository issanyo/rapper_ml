[Intro:DJ Paul, Juicy J]
[DJ Paul]
Ahh yeah, this the last song

[Juicy J]
Last motherfucking one

[DJ Paul]
Time to light em up


Chorus x4
This weed is got me high
So high, so high
This bud is got me high
So high, so high

(DJ Paul)
Mesmorized by the motherfuckin' drugs
Ya'll niggas don't get high
Like the dirty Three 6 Mafia
We smokers there to chain
Give a shotgun
Of cocaine to the brain
Gotta get high
Gotta get high
To a motherfucka die
These bitches don't hear me
But I can't keeps snorting all my drugs
With you cheap ass thugs
You hoes don't feel me

(Crunchy Blac)
Watcha got down in your trunk

(Juicy J)
Nothin' but leaves and bags of weed
Somethin' to keep you off your feet
Make you crawl around on knees
If you a slanga
Then grab a pound
If you a smoker
Fool don't get wild
Are you fucked up
So what
What's up
Sip on some beer and black and mild

(Crunchy Blac)
I'm so high
All I smell like is smoke
Yeah that motherfuckin' green
Yeah that god damn dope
You be hopin'
When you see me
I'm gon' roll up some
But i ain't gon' roll up nothing

(Gangsta Boo)
I'm smokin' on some blunts
Bigger than some of you rappers royalty checks
Never been mistaken
I'm the lady that be like
Quick to get up in your shit
Freaky when I'm high
That's the plan
Now understand my nig
Fuckin' on your man
Cause his ass wanna get with this

(Lord Infamous)
Art of the Scarecrow
The substance I've obtained,it's got me strange and feeling crazy
I'm smokin' on this doja
Got me stumblin' feelin' lazy
I'm staring at some shit
That got me dazin'
Amazing
Got plenty mo drugs left
And yeah you know
I'm stay blazing

(Koopsta Knicca)
Stayin' numb
Shit faced
Chee-cheef hit them killas
The swishers
Nigga wit that deep pulls
So deep that I cannot remember
And if you really wanna ride with thee, thee
Three 6 Mafia
It's no lie you'll get high

Chorus x4
