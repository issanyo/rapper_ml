It's my goal my goal in this fucking bitch
Now nigga gone die if he already tried shit
Try shit die bitch die bitch
In a ditch is where your motherfucking body's at
You and that fucking bitch for plotting shit
Yall done plot up on the wrong motherfucking click
We claiming 6-6-6 in this motherfucking bitch
And now yall got us loading up some shit
Kicking in some doors pushing on some floors
And now you got us looking for your ass boy
Its hard for me to be a MC in this game
Its hard for me to understand I fuck with pain
Its hard for me to picture how it was
In my eyes I picture nothing but blood
And blood my love on the pavement
Oh lord I think they might mistake it

[Koopsta Knicca]
It's a murder man serve hurt a man
Do him in quick drop his corpse in a can
Broken hand Satanic techniques creep
Sweep him off his feet commence to boxing that bitch
So say you wanna rumble with the rough Koopsta
Slugs bust sluts for the Mafia
Duck from my clutch fore your blood kicks quick
Pimp shit never miss if me shoot that bitch
Mentally insane there's no ho up in my brain
You may say that I'm deranged when I blow out your brains
Mane I ain't playing don't test this bitch
Shit I walk between the spaces of the morning and the darkeness
Ripped up chopped down the yellow sick road
Cause a ho choked bust nose kill a ho
So hear the little drummer beat
Switch here to lose it
Preachers in the news satanic cartoons fool
