There's a thin line between love and hate
I'm standing in a no man's land and I'm afraid
To try and reach the other side
How could you give back what you took and tried to hide?I should have never trusted you, left you by yourself
I watched for far too long
You made me think, you were in touch
And, oh, the pain I felt when I knew you'd moved onI never realized
You were running in circles
I let you lead when I knew damn well you were blind
I trusted you
