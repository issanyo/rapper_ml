And you see I ain't stoppin, and this the shit that a stunna do
And you see me with money, and this the shit that a stunna do

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Bitches on my dick mane, bouncin' on that shit
Like a pogo stick mang, cause I'm filthy rich
Jewelry game insane, diamonds glistenin'
And you know I make it rain, I'm known for drizzelin'
I smoke the best weed, then the ecstasy begin
With some orange juice, black chicks, & mexicans

Nut all on their backs slap that cape on
