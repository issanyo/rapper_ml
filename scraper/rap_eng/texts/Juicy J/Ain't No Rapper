[Intro: Juicy J]
Yo, you know, on some real shit, ummm.... you know niggas I fuck with man, you know what I'm sayin'? They don't rap man, you know what I'm sayin'? They don't do none of that shit man, you know what I'm sayin'? Them niggas ain't even be at my shows and shit you know what I'm sayin'? Them niggas be busy as hell man. That's street life nigga, real shit

[Hook: Juicy J]
My homeboys ain't no rappers, they ain't singin' songs
Put me in your rhymes, they gone show up at your home
Cause my homeboys ain't no rappers
I said my homeboys ain't no rappers
My homebodys ain't no rappers
They not doin' shows
They not in no videos
They too busy movin' dope
Cause my homeboys ain't no rappers
I said my homeboys ain't no rappers

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
My little partner he's so with it, he don't take no pictures
Ain't no photos just that .44, he go everywhere with it
Now this is real life, he knee deep in that white
Out here takin' care they family, they ainâ€™t doin' it for likes
Gotta meet in person to discuss this feature price
He get 25 years if they catch him on the mic
Nigga ain't no Source awards, ain't no MTV jams
Just a nigga in the trap with that sack, flippin' yams
Pockets XXL and extended magazines
Ain't no magazine cover, they just dodgin' undercovers
Go 'head, put me in your rhymes, let's see how that turn out
My little nigga hear that record then come see what you about

[Hook: Juicy J]
My homeboys ain't no rappers, they ain't singin' songs
Put me in your rhymes, they gone show up at your home
Cause my homeboys ain't no rappers
I said my homeboys ain't no rappers
My homebodys ain't no rappers
They not doin' shows
They not in no videos
They too busy movin' dope
Cause my homeboys ain't no rappers
I said my homeboys ain't no rappers


[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
I always wasn't a rapper, I was born a stacker
Coulda been a trapper, helped me get richer
Shouldn't have been a clapper, RIP my niggas
Double cups and handles, I don't fuck with liquor
Real street nigga, I don't diss niggas
Fuck the internet, we gon' get niggas
Niggas want the fame, I ain't into that
Switch up on his homies when he get a check

[Juicy J]
I'm just gettin' paid, I don't sneak diss
I just keep it G on some street shit
Teachers told me I ain't gon' be shit
I got rich and it ain't no secret
I'm the wrong nigga to hold beef with
Send 'em goons out to delete shit
They don't give a fuck, they just hit you up
Fuck this rap shit, ain't no back and forth

[Lil Herb]
Losin' your respect, I'ma keep mines
Fuck a peace sign, I throw up my set
Out the city now cause my city dry
But on the east side we leave niggas wet
Ninas, .40s, Tecs
Pull up on your block, leave your body stretched
Anybody next
You that nigga? I'm that nigga, been that nigga
You'se a copy cat, no one honours that

[Juicy J]
We get straight to it, we don't talk it out
Pull up to your house, catch you walkin' out
Let that gun go at your front door
It's a gun show and you got front row
Tried to warn you though
You ain't listen though
Now you bleedin' out on your kitchen floor
Get you murk'd off for that shit you wrote
Now that's what I call a killer flow

[Lil Herb]
Rappers wearin' wires, where the water at?
Niggas snitchin', he said where your honor at?
Young boy, I be where your momma at
Load the llamas up, where the drama at?
Bitches wanna fuck me now I'm popular
Niggas hatin' on me for a lot of stuff
So every time I move you know I got the tool
30 shots to her, stand on top of ya

[Juicy J]
You ain't livin' them punch lines
You fantasizin', you day dreamin'
You make believe, don't play with me
Cause I pull up on you 'bout 80 deep
Memphis Tennessee, we ain't bluffin' bitch
Stripper bitch might set ya up
We might book you for a concert
Make you come to town just to wet you up

[Outro: Juicy J]
My homeboys ain't no rappers
They too busy movin' dope
Movin' dope, busy movin' dope
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
They too busy movin' dope
Movin' dope
They too busy movin' dope
They too busy movin' dope
