[Intro]
I just called up to the label. I was tellin' them, ya know. If they wanna pay me... to bring out my album... I gotta get that shit now

[Chorus]
I need that check in advance
I need that check in advance (I need it)
I need that check in advance
I needa count up my bands, yeah
I need that check in advance, yeah
I need that check in advance, yeah
I need that check in my hand, yeah
I needa count up my bands, yeah

[Verse 1]
I need that check in advance, they lurkin' go check on the land
Don't give a fuck what you say to my face what you niggas gone say on the stands?
Rubber bands stretchin' grams, so hard I can cut you a Xan
Keepin' my brothers, I eat with my brothers on me, what the fuck is a friend?
I'm on a beach so you know I'm not playin'
Shooters gone hop out the [?] the van
Bro 'nem gon' hop out with Tommy and Nina, then they gon' hop out with Gina and Pam
I know we bluffin' but I don't say nothin'
I not with the talkin' it's cheaper than stands
Work off prepaid, been up 3 days, and I bought 3 K's, don't fuck with the clan, nigga
Suzy ready, what you payin' (payin')? Run it up, I never ran
And four eyes in the cut with the heaters on them so expect to dropped if you get out of hand, my man

[Chorus]
I need that check in advance
I need that check in advance (I need it)
I need that check in advance
I needa count up my bands, yeah
I need that check in advance, yeah
I need that check in advance, yeah
I need that check in my hand, yeah
I needa count up my bands, yeah

[Verse 2]
I got the look, I'm the man, I had to cook up a plan
I keep a zip on me, I keep a grip on me, it's hard to pull up my pants
I like the to jet to back out when I land
What would you do for your bro in a jam?
What would you do for your homie, your fam?
What would you do for a brick or a band? (Not a damn thing)
Caught her with my first gun (gun)
Shots fired, code red
Rosses with choppas we poppin' imposters
Turn coppers to pasta then go pop a Xan
Fuckin' up a nigga's plan, we comin', you don't even got a chance
This shit monopoly, you on my property, how you gone pay for your life with them bands?

[Outro]
Yeah. So, just got off the phone with Rifkind. He said he gone pay the money. Appreciate that shit Columbi
