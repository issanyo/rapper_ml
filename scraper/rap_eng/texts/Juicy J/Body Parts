[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Juicy J I keep them shooters
They gun you down cause I say so

Now what the fuck you niggas scared for?
They about that action
They don't do no rapping
Ain't got shit to lose
They grab them choppers and start clapping
Pull up at your moma house, everybody is a victim
Nigga we don't leave no witness, we be gone on a mission
Gone, now you gon' miss
Them choppers on us, no pistols
Couple hundred rounds gunned you down
Shit sound like some missiles
Man, these niggas ain't straight
Niggas ain't getting no cake
Niggas ain't flipping no weight
Niggas just getting in the way
Boy these streets ain't safe, try me, make my day
Point them guns your way and now you ain't got no face
OG in the game and them niggas that focus on somebody that playin' with yall so gucci
My nigga I stunt, I will snatch up your dollars
When I'm in the club I got 100 bottles
You hating ass niggas you ain't got no spine
They run up on my watch, so I can't waste no time
Not only a threat, I'm also the best
You gon' have to learn to accept it like death

[Verse 2: Koopsta Knicca]
Which one of you fuck niggas wanna test me
Real goons, real me, they gone call the police
Siren sounds, get this bitch up out this hoe
I had to show his cover, snatchin' nuts up out they throat
North Memphis beat down, caught 'em on the rebound
Deftones, Funky Town, cry now, gun sound
Dead mane broke parts, more to get pulled apart
Koopsta too hard, my god, body parts

[Verse 3: Skinny Pimp]
Chrome 40 mag, when you got 'em stuck
Ran through the hood, then you ran for the door
Got a whole lot of bands but it's not for sale
Real street niggas don't hide here
Ducking and dodging the cops and shit
No it ain't shit to
But it bounce right back at big Mafia 6ix
They can't keep Skinny Pimp in this bitch
With DJ Paul, Gangsta Boo, Scarecrow, Crunch' and Koop
We breaking the law, damn they down my door, it's a fact y'all
We turning it up, put to hood [?]
All of us gots a plug
Niggas ain't got no money, why you trying to fuck with us?

[Verse 4: Lil Wyte]
And I got that thang changed, I hope you ready for what has begun
Dumped all these body parts in my trunk, and I did that there just for fun
Paul told me a long time ago "This day would come"
And it's finally here
I got blonde hair, both eyes are blue, my german blood is that pure
Now I'm all the way gone ho when you need this shit
Get blessed like you done sneezed and shit
I'm starting a new religion and The Scarecrow
Will be my beacon bitch
Mafia for life with me, my third eye will always see a 6
I'm fully involved will all of this, it's Lil Wyte till I'm deceased bitch

[Verse 5: Crunchy Black]
I'm all about my business, I'm all about my bread
Shoot these motherfuckers dead in the head
I'mma make sure all you motherfuckers dead
Catch a nigga slipping, hit him for the bread
Duct-duct tape them, that's what I said
Check from over there, look up under the bed
All a nigga came for was motherfucking bread
Mafia 6ix in this motherfucking bitch

[Verse 6: La Chat]
La Chat bitch, I'm wrecking shit
Bitch talking, texting and shit
Now these hoes be talking shit
But ya hoes respect this bitch
Memphis, Tenn not gang land, right hand's my gun hand
Fucked up, we getting fucked up, that bull shit, fuck you say?
Bodies we be slaying, fuck you we dump them in your trunk
No remorse for all these haters, run them down like Forest Gump
Westwood is my hood, and I rep it all day
Automatics, desert eagles is the tools, wanna play?

[Verse 7: Project Pat]
Pat'aahh
Chopper on the floor, work on the stove
Loud to my lips, smoke out my nose
All these bands, I be jugging on my hustle, on my grind
You get fucked up little pussy with my fingers on this nine
Cut the grass like a lawnmower, like a rake
Fought you niggas like Django, quick as a snake
Anything for the money, wrappin' dummies, you been had
With the pistols upside your head I'm like death checkin' bad
Project like them Rolex's and them Breitling's
Duffel bag full of motherfucking dead white men
Thought you bitch pussy was on lock down like the pen
But I smashed on her ass like [?]

[Verse 8: Locodunit]
Ready for 09's, ain't got a role model
You fuck with my high, you're not going to roll right
Breaking two gold bottles, hang with the real
Chill with the real robbers, killers and pill poppers
We cuffing that shit and them niggas who steal choppers
Fuck how you feel about us, Real lane
Scale-A-Ton tatted cross my arm, drum in my palms
Kush weed in my index and my thumb, exhale from my lungs
Load the Tommy Gun, split the tongues, kill them one by one
And dump all they body parts into my trunk

[Verse 9: Point Blank]
Didn't give a fuck about yesterday, don't give a fuck today
And tomorrow
I'm probably going to feel the same fucking way
They love you me I hit it, hate me when I miss it
So much yack in my system you can smell it when I'm pissing
I smoke like a broke down engine
I love my money like I love my women
Let me show you how to whip it
Let me show you how to pack it
Let me show you how to sell it
Let me show you how to stack it
Pillow talking with these rats might get you excited
But don't let the pillow talk get you green lighted
Now I'm in the mix with the Mafia 6ix, but I breathe H-Town
I'mma die coalition (South Park coalition)
Told you once, told you a million motherfucking times
I'm like a shredder, don't get caught up in my fucking grind
Miss me with that shit, it's the wrong night
Body parts, hope it's them bitch niggas I don't like

[Verse 10: J-Green, aka JGRXXN]
M - Monkey ass niggas eat banana clips
A - And water niggas 'bout to make me click
F - Fucking with the 6ix, catch a hollow tip
I - I never go, never holla click
A - Ana for you niggas to the grizzle
And niggas think they superman, so you can get ya issue
6ix - million ways to put them in the trunk
JGRXXN on the scene, put the body parts in dump

[Verse 11: Kokoe & DJ Paul]
I’m the hardest Mexican, out of west L.A
Talk that shit your body end up in the fucking bay
All I listen to is Eazy and N.W.A
Now I'm riding with the Mafia, homie known to spray
Numb killers, drug dealers, cap-pealers
And hoes that never catch feelings
Cut the check, I cut your neck, put you in a body bag
Because your boy never ever ever have respect for a snitch
Nah bitch (Don't want it)
Nah bitch (Don't want it)
Nah, nah, nah, nah (Don't want it)
Scale-A-Ton advocates, Scale-A-Ton advocates, you don't want nothing bitch

[Verse 12: Lord Infamous]
It's the murder chainsaw massacre
Kalashnikov attacking ya
I'm leaking them like Dracula
The bullets get on smacking ya
The ammo enter front then it coming out the back of ya
I got a butcher blade
It's getting frantic when I'm stabbing ya
Dagger detachin'-ous, sledgehammer smash ya up
Put on the gas and light a match, watch your ass combust
I am Lord Infamous, I do not take prisoners
Mission to injure ya, decrease your temperature
Serial killer, wicked voodoo minister
Scorpion, sometimes I'm Dr. Kevorkian
Shoot you in the porch and leave your kids, need an orphanage
Ghetto went corporate, Illuminati ornament

[Verse 13: Gangsta Boo]
All these fake ass hoes in my face, mane we ain't cool
Got back with the 6ix, now I'm killin' bitches, Boo sewed up
Unexpected got them bitches shaking
Leave you like you shot your own self in the basement
Grew up in Memphis, so I'm kinda crazy
I don't give a fuck about what they saying
Hashtag that shit, put them in the river
Muddy Mississippi we some cold stone killers

[Verse 14: DJ Paul]
Yeah, the Champ is here
I'm 'bout to come out swinging
Why the fuck these niggas fuck with me, what was they thinkin'?
What the fuck they on? What the hell you niggas been drinking?
I'm too deep in the game my dudes slay these niggas delinquints
[?] you out of sequence
I put you in on a secret, I make you stop breathing
I leave your ass stinking without me even fucking blinking
I'm harder than hard, don't fuck with the god
I come from a part where niggas don't starve, where niggas they in
Don't give a fuck about friends, them niggas hittin'
I leave them leaking, and that there is a fuckin' bad end
My gun don't give a fuck about illegal when I pull the trigger
It don't care if you even a fucking nigga
This pussy shit is unacceptable, don't test my testicles
I'm pointing red decimals, and leaving you niggas vegetables
With Ben Frank's & Jackson is the only way I got two faces
Hydra-shok bullets strong enough to take out two faces
Niggas got my name on their tongue like they shoe laces
I lace you niggas with revolver bullets and leave no traces
Leave them up with the slug, mouth full of silverware
Put the price on your head, now my goons are millionaire
Quickness like intensive care, put you niggas in prison care
I don't give a fuck about care, so I never care
I’m a millionaire so the traphouse a brick..
Nah I'm lying, I still sell a brick
A gun from the M, so I still sell a bitch
Ride around in a Rolls with my nose in that shit, trick
With hella guns, big guns, you really want some?
I' ain't Santa, I'm Satan, my guns go rappa-pam-pam
And I bomb on these bitches Vietnam these niggas know
Where the fuck I'm coming from, try to play dumb ya done, bitch!!

[Outro: DJ Paul]
Fuck you motherfuckers
I'm out of here
I'm going to the bar
