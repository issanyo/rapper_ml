[Intro: Koopsta Knicca & Three 6 Mafia]
Bitch the Koopsta massive when I murder
With the muthafuckin' plastic nine
Bitch the Koopsta massive when I murder
With the muthafuckin' plastic nine
Ma-Ma-Ma-Mafia

[Verse 1]
This ain't a mixtape, bitch, this a rich tape
Nah, it ain't my birthday, but I got big cake
Give a bitch a shot, she don't wanna miss a big break
Big bank, big frank, rollie with the big face
Run up too fast, that'll be a mistake
Glock 17 make a nigga get his shit straight
Chrome to the dome, put the dick in ya' bitch face
Rolls Royce truck, we just call it the big wraith

[Interlude: (Koopsta Knicca), Juicy J & Three 6 Mafia]
(Bitch the Koopsta massive when I murder
With the muthafuckin' plastic nine)
Hold on hoe, hold on
Bring that shit back
(Bitch the Koopsta massive when I murder
With the muthafuckin' plastic nine)
Hold on hoe, hold on hoe
Hold on
Ma-Ma-Ma-Mafia
Bitch

[Verse 2]
Three six Bentley on that flow shit
Yo' new shit sound like my old shit
Ya'll niggas just like rocks in the ocean
Get the hoes twisted, now they wide open
Told ya, I ain't got time for the bull
My name hold weight, in the street, I got pull
Murdered that pussy, I'm killing ya'll boys
$uicideboy$ be killing ya'll noise
When it rains it pours, good dope coming out my pores
Walk in, buy the whole store
'Member I was poor, oh well, not no more
Get paid, fuck these whores
Used to have to sell that rock
Now, we be rockin' these shows, we all on tours
Ball like I handle that rock
Come to the crib, hit the bitch on woodgrain floors

[Bridge: (Juicy J), Koopsta Knicca & Three 6 Mafia]
(Yeah hoe)
Bitch the Koopsta massive when I murder
(Yeah hoe)
With the muthafuckin' plastic nine
(Yeah hoe)
Bitch the Koopsta massive when I murder
(Yeah hoe)
With the muthafuckin' plastic nine
Ma-Ma-Ma-Mafia

[Outro: Juicy J]

(Yeah hoe, yeah hoe)

(Yeah hoe, yeah hoe)
Make you wanna leave your man
(Yeah hoe, yeah hoe, yeah)
