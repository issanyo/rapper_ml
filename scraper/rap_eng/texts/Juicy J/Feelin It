(Intro)
Yamine new album man

(Bridge)
Yes I struggle
Heck yeah I struggle
I’m feeling this groove
So I hustle
I got a job
And yeah that’s work though
I can get it and quite it on the buckle

(Hook)
I’m feelin it
I’m feelin it
I’m feelin it
(gone fill it up)
I’m feelin it
I’m feelin it
I’m feelin it
(yeah give it up)

(Verse 1)
These niggas thought I was done
Well nope I just won
I’m the realest nigga, don’t have a trigger
So I spun
Yes I go and run
Nope I go like none
I’m living in a holy house
My mom’s like a nun
(yeah)
Teaming with Pippen
Jordans are sixes
All fresh and clean
While these haters tripping
I thought you was tipping
Instead she tricking
Hoeing to hoeing
From dooring to dooring
Doing this so much
That her sex becomes boring
(yeah)
I got the green and no I’m not flexing
You can search up my stats
Nigga stop texting


(Bridge)
Yes I struggle
Heck yeah I struggle
I’m feeling this groove
So I hustle
I got a job
And yeah that’s work though
I can get it and quite it on the buckle

(Hook)
I’m feelin it
I’m feelin it
I’m feelin it
(gone fill it up)
I’m feelin it
I’m feelin it
I’m feelin it
(yeah give it up)
