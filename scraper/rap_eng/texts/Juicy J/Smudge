Verse 1: Juicy J
Commas after commas, if it's money, I'm comin'
I've got bands, Mr Drummond
Fuck the hoes that you lovin'
Rock designer's, that's nothin'
Private jet, man that's stuntin'
You never did this shit, so my niggas start frontin' (start frontin')
Last lady, yeah she ain't even legal (no)
I let her drive the Benz, cos she match my ego (ego)
? ? ?
I'm ballin' like Roland
Catchin' wind with the top down, I feel like I'm ballin' (ballin' ballin')
Money don't bend, zeroes don't end
All this money that I'm stackin' in
I was settin' trend
Still on that real shit, you rap niggas ain't gon' kill shit
Hundred bands, up in the club, don't give a shit cos I'm still rich

Chorus: Mila J
I remember when we started textin'
I was playin' it cool, you was flexin'
I know I wasn't the only one you messed with
But it was good, I was on to the next one
I remember when you started checking
Checking up, boy you must've learned your lesson
Tryna tell me how I always was a blessin'
Blessin', stated the obvious
Bitch you guessed it, oh

Verse 2: Drxga
Bitch you's a blessin'
You the one that I mess with
You the one that I got
Any man try to fuck with you, we come with head shots
Or a tummy tuck, in a armored truck
Knock on his door, then we shoot him up
He gon' slump, then I fuck his bitch
Then we dip out by the side door
Never speak of it again, yuh

Chorus: Mila J
I remember when we started textin'
I was playin' it cool, you was flexin'
I know I wasn't the only one you messed with
But it was good, I was on to the next one
I remember when you started checking
Checking up, boy you must've learned your lesson
Tryna tell me how I always was a blessin'
Blessin', stated the obvious
Bitch you guessed it, oh
