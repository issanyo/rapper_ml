Yeah, me and my homie this is our year
And it's going down like a fire drill
Came a long way, now we part here
And we still running shit, call it diarrhea
Coming up together like them good fellas
Heart through the loop
Holding down, keep it real to these streets
Back to the roof
Anywhere, anytime I got your back like a spine
My homies never left behind
My whole team get to shine
No [?] ?? that's why we're blowing up
That's why we rolling up
Drinking till we throw up
The way we get this cheddar, there ain't nobody better
Write our names in the sky cause we gonna LIVE FOREVER
Live forever, man!

[LIZ:]
We're gonna live forever (Live forever)
We're gonna live forever (Live forever)
We're gonna live for
We're gonna live for
We're gonna live for
We're gonna live for
We're gonna live for
We're gonna live for

Life of the party, Patron and Bacardi
Get faded, get sloppy, and all in a chick's body
Came up with the people that's real, ticket to the meal
Now like it, we all together, that's just how it is
I'm throwed like a strike out, shine brighter than a lighthouse
Bigger than the White House, go against my team, get wiped out
Got them choppers like troopers, don't make these bitches hear
My lil' homie left up here, he's smoking like a scene

[LIZ:]
We're gonna live forever (Live forever)
We're gonna live forever (Live forever)
We're gonna live for
We're gonna live for
We're gonna live for
We're gonna live for
We're gonna live for
We're gonna live for
