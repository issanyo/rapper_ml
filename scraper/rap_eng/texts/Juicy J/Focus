[Intro]
You know man the problem with niggas these days is niggas always worried about what another motherfucker gettin'
You know what I'm sayin'? What another nigga is drivin' and shit
Nigga you gotta stay focused nigga, get your own shit nigga

[First Chorus]
I feel like I popped a Adderall
I feel like I popped a Adderall
I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin' too much (I'm thinkin' too much man)
I'm drinkin', I'm drinkin', I'm drinkin', I'm drinkin' too much (You know it!)
300, 300, I'm on 300 percent (Three hunnid)
300, 300, you want it 300 percent (Three hunnid)
300, (Three hunnid) 300, I'm on 300 percent (Three hunnid!)
300, (Yessir! Whoop!) you wit' it, (Whoop!) I'm wit' it 300 percent (Whoop!)

[Verse 1]
I'm focused
I'm focused 'cause I gotta get it all
Focused 'cause I gotta get it off
And I gotta pay for this fuckin' loss
I gotta pay for this Bentley
These hatin' ass niggas they just wanna knock me off
Yeah, they wanna knock me off
And your bitch she wanna come suck me off
These niggas ain't gettin' no money
So I got no reason to fuck with ya'll
These bitches ain't bringin' no money
In so I have no reason to fuck at all
You gotta stay focused when you have money
Gotta stay focused, they want them hunnids
Shit you let go when you have that money
You get no love when you get no money
You got no money then you got no power
You got no power, you got no respect
Got no respect then you gon' need that Tec
Gon' need a Tec, then you gon' need a vest
You need a vest, you just a fuckin' nigga
And just move right up off of the set
Bitch you already know I got them racks
Come to your city get that pussy wet
Hop on the jet, feel like I'm blessed

[Chorus]
I feel like I popped a Adderall
I feel like I popped a Adderall
I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin' too much
I'm drinkin', I'm drinkin', I'm drinkin', I'm drinkin' too much
300, 300, I'm on 300 percent
300, 300, you want it 300 percent
300, 300, I'm on 300 percent
300, you wit' it, I'm wit' it 300 percent

[Verse 2]
This ho got her ass out
I might pull some cash out
I might hit my stash house
And I might bring them racks out
I don't want your liquor nigga, 'cause I got that drink
I don't wanna smoke with you because I keep that dank
I don't want your money, I got racks up in the bank
I don't want your bitch, my bitch look like Rihanna in the face
I ain't tryna catch no case
I'm just tryna pop a case
I'm just tryna have a ball, do it all in your face (Let's go!)
I done hit the dealership and I done emptied out my safe
I done spent your advance on a motherfuckin' Wraith
I be smokin', just don't lose your focus
Pulled up in a Benz, then I pulled off in a Lotus
I'm floatin', I'm focused

[Chorus]
I feel like I popped a Adderall
I feel like I popped a Adderall
I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin' too much
I'm drinkin', I'm drinkin', I'm drinkin', I'm drinkin' too much
300, 300, I'm on 300 percent
300, 300, you want it 300 percent
300, 300, I'm on 300 percent
300, you wit' it, I'm wit' it 300 percent

[Verse 3]
(Take another dab, blow the smoke out like it's hookah)
(Take another dab, blow the smoke out like it's hookah)
I feel a need for the weed, let's roll the trees
'til we can't breath, my Lamborghini got OCD
That ho so clean, that bitch with me, perfect physique
From overseas she spend a G like every week, jizz on her weave
I spend like 3 that's everyday, just on my weed
Smoke out my suite, me and my team
T-G-O-D that's all I need
We come in peace, we thick as thieves
And keep some heat, clip on that piece long as a sleeve
Always stoned, money so long the other day I hit the bank and gave them a loan
I got a pint of Texas tea, some Cali trees that might agree
And if you think we not at this money, then you higher than me
(Take another dab, blow the smoke out like it's hookah)
(Take another dab, blow the smoke out like it's hookah)
(Take another dab, blow the smoke out like it's hookah)
(Take another dab, blow the smoke out like it's hookah)
