[Intro: Juicy J]
Twerk twerk twerk twerk twerk that ass
Twerk twerk twerk twerk twerk twerk that ass
Twerk twerk twerk twerk twerk twerk that ass
Move that ass left and right gon' work that ass

[Hook: Trey Songz & Juicy J]
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
Ones, fives, tens, twenties
Work your way up to them big face hundreds, just bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Make that ass roll, make that, make that ass roll
Drop it to the floor, make it roll like a twenty four
Go and make a broke nigga spend it
Go and show 'em why them hoes be winnin'
These couple racks an accomplishment
Rollin' up, talkin' shit, smack you on your ass, that’s a compliment
Put a flag on it, that’s a continent
Young Khalifa ballin', well that's common sense
Counterfeit niggas claim they out here but they out of it
Now I get, get it and my whip sick wit it
I get million dollar pussy 'cause my dick six digits
Bitches wanna fuck me, she should be a fan first
Tryna show off for the cameras
Bitch, your ass ain't better than Ambers'
She keep talkin' 'bout she wanna do me and her, I said damn

[Hook: Trey Songz & Juicy J]
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
Ones, fives, tens, twenties
Work your way up to them big face hundreds, just bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
High yellow chick got me hypnotized, got me in a trance
Now I’m poppin’ bands, Avrah Kadabra I’m in her pants
Twenty minutes later now I’m in her friend and we in my Benz
Playin’ hokey pokey 'cause if she drop out another bitch hop in
All I know is that fetty, you broke nigga you petty
Juicy J, I hustle hard, and I'm slicker than K-Y Jelly
Hold up, I’m just tryna find me a Nicki Minaj
Come here pretty chick give my dick a message
Freaky chick, I’m 'bout to hit in the car
She threw it back before I even pulled in the garage
Hit the dealership, they tried to play me, niggas must be trippin’
Threw a couple hundred bands on the floor
Now you actin' like a stripper tryna make his commission
It’s all mine and I spend it
Don’t worry about it I got plenty
I got your baby mamma in my new Bugatti
She threw it back like my engine

[Hook: Trey Songz & Juicy J]
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
Ones, fives, tens, twenties
Work your way up to them big face hundreds, just bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
You say no to ratchet pussy, Trigga Trey can’t
Plus I told them bitches do what Juicy J say
You ain’t spendin’ money, then you niggas in the way
And the way she bounce, might just turn her to a dinner plate
Broke niggas back off up, weak bitches don’t talk to her
I ain’t never seen an ass that soft a brother like, fabric softener
But hold up, hold up, I ain’t tryna control her
Know what, money talk, and I told that bitch, hey fuck you think that pole for?
Do pussy tricks, yo pussy spit, piercin' all in her pussy lips
Money maker her cum, we see how wet that pussy get
See how wet the pussy get
When you bounce it, when you bounce it

[Hook: Trey Songz & Juicy J]
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
Ones, fives, tens, twenties
Work your way up to them big face hundreds, just bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand

[Outro: Juicy J]
