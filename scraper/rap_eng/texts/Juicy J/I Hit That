I hit that, I hit that
I can’t even lie, I drilled that pussy
I can’t even lie, I ditched that pussy
Take this $500 and let me get that pussy

I hit that, I hit that
I can’t even lie, I drilled that pussy
I can’t even lie, I ditched that pussy
Take this $500 and let me get that pussy

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
You gonna take this $500 and let me get that thing
I can’t even lie I can’t resist that frame
The way she ride a dick is a goddamn shame
And the way she suck a dick I can’t forget that brain
It’s a real good day, make six good plays
Kept her at the mansion like six whole days
I’m not no kid and I sure don’t play
But my money’s standing taller than a high top fade
I’m looking oh so Dapper Dan in these brand new Js
Multimillionaire with all these goddamn waves?
Tried to charge me 500, baby that’s chump change
And your boyfriend is a lame, I’m a goddamn train

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
If I had a quarter for all the whores I hit
I’d be like Bill Gates, top of the Fortune list
I heard your girlfriend cheated on you, that’s unfortunate
And she prayed the soul, the baby, y’all aborted it
I hit like five dimes but I ain’t keepin’ score with it
And that was yesterday, I’m ballin’ like a Patriot
I give her dirt, you say you’re drinking ‘cause I paid for it
But I’m so rich, bitch, that it ain’t really cost me shit
They let the boss in this bitch, I’m spillin’ sauce ’n' shit
I’m Mr. Forbes list bitch, I got a costly dick
Your baby momma in the booth suckin’ sausages
I’m gettin’ my dick sucked in my office sippin’ coffee, bitch ('sgucci!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
She got a lot, she gettin’ paid
Bust it open, watch her work the stage
Slidin’ down the pole like she’s finna for the fire
You smoke her out, I get the bitch higher
Hotties clappin’ that ass for cash
Bitch nigga I’m throwin’ bags
Poppin’ bottles, throwin’ dollars
Gin down the throat, make that bitch swallow
Make her twerk while I’m puffin' purp'
She gon’ make your pockets hurt
Dance so freaky, I like it raw
But Juciy J ain’t Dirt McGirt
This look like the Player’s Club
Plus they all be showing love
VIP with the ratchet bitches
Shakin’ ass, off the drugs (mollies!)
They love me in the club
‘cause they know I’m tippin’
She might leave with a coupe
That’s just how I’m feelin’
Real street nigga
I’mma let her hit my weed
Take her to my hotel
And put her on her knees

[Hook]
