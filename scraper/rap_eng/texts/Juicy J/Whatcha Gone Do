Yee ain't 'bout gun play
Maybe if you cut the acting you prolly could be one someday
Street so cold you barely can trust your bro
You are ain't no better than to trust these hoes
You think that your people got 'em, watch 'em close
Shit so bad can't dab a nigga up no more
Anytime, any place, any day, anyway I still get paid
Sellin' dimes, sellin' weight
It don't matter, get out here and get your cake
Wanna ball, better know get some dope niggas gon' try'na block
Turn up on 'em, get your money
Keep stuntin', them niggas gon' try'na swap

[Verse 2]
We got paper errwhere, ridin' in the rave, high as shit
Headed to the booty club, lookin' for a fly chick
50k in both my hands
I just want a private dance
She like "whatchu got to spend?"
I'm like "bitch that all depends"
Watch how hard I make it rain
Leave that pussy soakin' wet
My big faces all blue like Ben Franklin' been holdin' his breath
She know what I came to see
Suck me right, I pay them bills
Know that pussy [?]
Wake up kick her out my hotel
You gotta get home, you can't stay
Juicy J cut her like OJ
She thought it was love, no way
Nah I ain't that nigga
Go back to that nigga that miss ya
She thought it was more than a one night stand
It's clear this bitch got issue
