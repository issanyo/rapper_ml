[Intro]
Your boys and Juicy J
Woozy gang

[Verse 1]
Don't let me get in my zone
Got a moonrock in my cone
Got a bad chick in my i8
& her ass off of (?)
I just rang through but
Half a mil to remodel my home
That I only slept in twice
Smoked out parties every other night
I am not at the club
I brought the club to me
And you not on the guest-list
If you ain't got no double D's

[Hook]
Moonrock in my cone (Repeat)

[Verse 2]
Sleepin on your chick
She saw my car and she blacked out
She woke up and saw a real nigga, for the first time
And passed back out
Fucking with a vet
I got these hoes in check
I break some rubberbands, they get they panties wet
Just copped a pound, and let her break it down in a lab
Then roll up some more cones
And blow more smoke than a power plant

[Hook]
