Got the glow!
We got the glow!
The clothes are neat
The women are beautiful
Got the glow!
We got the glow!
The stride is long
We got somewhere to go
Got the glow!
We got the glow!
We take weekends
Up in the Poconos
Got the glow!
We got the glow!
The pocket's full
The wad is set to blow
No need to vote
Business leans our way
No need to drive the block
We got valets
The work is lucrative
It's done with ease
No point in wishin' when
Weather always clears
Got the glow!
We got the glow!
We don't pay tax
We pay to get loopholes
Got the glow!
We got the glow!
Future's good
When there's nothin' else left to know
Got the glow!
We got the glow!
Skin is bronzed
The wrist is bathed in gold
Got the glow!
We got the glow!
If you serve us
The tippin' is mighty low
The steak is rare
Tablecloths are real
Breathe the clean air
Accounts are overseas
The crowd's all part
As we come through
The hangers-on
All come around to mooch
Come around to mooch
Our friendships end in a petty clash
We make new friends and they won't last
Let's celebrate this life of leisure
Who really cares if it lasts either
Got the glow!
We got the glow!
The clothes are neat
The women are beautiful
Got the glow!
We got the Glow!
The stride is long
Cause we got somewhere to go
