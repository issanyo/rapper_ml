Half of me is apathy
The other half is after me
Half of me’s a tragedy
It’s sad that I ain’t passed it
Everything you heard is fallacy
Florida born in accord with only one Lord
That’s sort of my anatomy
Half me’s analogy
A slave and a master
Half of me is brave
The other half’s half amazing
I was raised in the lower middle-class
Passing through
Always passing never passing out in school
Half of me’s academy
The student and the faculty
Half of that’s a travesty
I’m just being adamant

Homie that’s inaccurate
Never be inanimate
Girl snap out of it
You know I practice abstinence
Stop me if I’m babbling on
I have a habit of song
I like the sound of guitars
I like to look at the stars
I think a lot about the world
As if it was ours
I like to ball
Quarterbacking the squad
From the backyard
Yay tall
Friday night dreaming
Grew up around some hustlers
Maybe I was scheming
Cheesin'
Posing with my lenses
I smile real wide
Though I reside in my mental
Senseless
Um, I’m mean
Penniless
Penny loafer shoes
Used to act like I was semi-rich
Raised by the tele set
Product of a TV dream
But never selling it
Looking for the truth
But it’s hard when no one’s telling it

It’s picture perfect
But some of you ain’t getting it
Simple, single
Mind's on a pencil and paper
When all they talk about is dollar symbols
It’s like they’re all stenciled
I flow really gentle
I guess that makes a gentleman
That’s my fundamental
I’m far from an immigrant
Now I’m in my element
All about my Prophet
That’s my only testament
I strive for the truth I could feel it in my chest
So I rise and salute to the one that knows best
No rest
I’m just trying to be the best yet
