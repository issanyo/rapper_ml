[Verse 1]
A-T-L-A-N-T-A, you know I know you notice
Bout the work my magic, motherfuckin hocus-pocus
I hope you get the picture, motherfucker stay in focus
Until the quiet comes, I ride them drums like Flying Lotus
You dealin with the dopest, I rode up and I wrote this
I wrote this and I hope this, will help a fella notice
That this is not for play, this shit go hard as Georgia clay
My momma still hopping a MARTA to this motherfucking day
I'm from the 'A', I'm a product of that Big Boi and Dre
I've been Outkazzy from the day they dropped that shit on La Face
There ain't no shit on my face, I don't brown nose anybody
Fuck you to you and your label, down to the staff in the lobby
It-it don't sound like no hobby, flow as hot as Mohave
I been as hot as wasabai, hold on I won't Kemosabe
Without a big up from poppy, I'm tryin' to stay in my zone
Talking about 'cop me a chain', I'd rather cop me a home
Make it known

[Hook]
And poppa never drove no (Poppa never drove no)
Big fancy car (Diamond in the back, sunroof top)
And momma never want no
Big Diamond like a star
And I ain't never had no (I ain't never had no misconceptions)
Misconceptions about who we are (About who we was)
Naw, naw, naw, naw (I'm gonna do me, and these niggas)

All I ever wanted was to not be the same
Came up the hard way, just for the game
One for the money, ain't too much for fame
Now they looking at me saying 'Brother, you changed'
Saying 'Brother, you changed'

Settle down now, settle down, settle down

[Verse 2]
It's Sugar shawty, where the weed, y'all know that I spark a lot
Chrome box Chevy, I just want to play the parking lot
Used to be on Addy across the street from the Camelot
Now I'm in a National, sugar, if you a fan or not
I don't give a damn or not, I gotta get this bread
See them biting my style, Luis Alberto Suarez
Stuff I spit out my head, even sweeter than Pez
And if you down in St. Pauls, you probably sweeter than Fez
What I said, what I pledged, when I came, to the door
Got it tatted on my neck, and got my back, then you know
Wanted more, from the gate, I been smokin', you relate
Y'all let me do nothing, nigga, let me be great
Demonstrate, demonstrate, coming down interstates
Gold rims, white walls, looking like dinner plates
Who you trying to emulate? Nigga's trying to innovate
This is southwest, sugar, I'm the shit in any state
Goodness sake

[Hook]
