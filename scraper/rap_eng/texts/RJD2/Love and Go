[Verse 1]
This one's got amnesia
This one's got a broken wheel
But you should see it go
Don't get close to the sickness
I am my own witness
You should take your love and go

[Chorus]
Every other Christmas
I am begging your forgiveness
Sorry Mama from the bottom of my soul
And if I ever reach you
I'll be sure to give the credit
Where it goes
Where it goes

[Verse 2]
Don't worry about my friend
He's not so schitzophrenic
Seems like he is good to go
Don't need to hide my jackals
Since you've never read those books, no
I'm a yellow fever
Something's in the ether
Seems you will believe and go
Don't say I never said it
Right there in the vibrant note, no

[Chorus]
Every other Christmas
I am begging your forgiveness
Sorry Mama from the bottom of my soul
And if I ever reach you
I'll be sure to give the credit
Where it goes
Where it goes

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Every other Christmas
I am begging your forgiveness
Sorry Mama from the bottom of my soul
And if I ever reach you
I'll be sure to give the credit
Where it goes
Where it goes
