When the [?]
Are just another part of you
It's time to put down your TV

When the bedsores
Don't even bother you
Open the shades a peek

Whoa, lazy man
You broke the laws of the gods
Whoa-oh, lazy man
You broke the laws of the gods

If you lay awake at night
And you shit where you sleep
Don't get a job, go get a few
Don't come home for a week

We would see it that [?]

Whoa, lazy man
You broke the laws of the gods
Whoa-oh, lazy man
You broke the laws of the gods

Whoa, lazy man
You broke the laws of the gods
Whoa-oh, lazy man
You broke the laws of the gods

History, science, philosophy
These channels all deserve a platinum trophy
Or an Emmy

Whoa, trust that I love TV too
Whoa, trust that I love TV too
