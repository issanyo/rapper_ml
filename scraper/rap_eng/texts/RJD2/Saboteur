[Verse 1]
She struck by the fire and there's no retreat
Too tangled in your wires, this is my defeat
I am waiting for forgiveness for the past
A little empathy is that too much to ask

[Chorus]
For a lifetime I've tried
All they said was be your best
(be your best)
But when their blueprint goes right all they say it's your mess

I am waiting for forgiveness for the past
A little empathy is that too much to ask

[Verse 2]
I laid across my bed with open eyes
And searched to find out why
I find the way to the darkness when it seems so bright

[Chorus]
For a lifetime I've tried all they said was be your best
But when their blueprint goes right all they say its your mess
(its your mess)

[Verse 3]
Give it time
One day you'll look into my eyes
Just when you think that everything is alright
I will find a way to break our hearts
Break our hearts
I will find a way to break our hearts
Our hearts
Maybe this is just the process love me
Guillotine of fire what will it be then
Is it now or never
Is it too late to see more
