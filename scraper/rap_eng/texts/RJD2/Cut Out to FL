[Intro]
(Is there something wrong?)
Uh, I was just sort of, you know, thinking about tomorrow
The lawyer said I'll probably get off, you know, probation or something like that
But he might be just saying that, afraid I'll jump bail and take off
(What are you gonna do?)
I was thinking about cutting out to Florida tonight

[Interlude]
I said I'm thinking about getting lost down there
You know, it's real warm down there
If I moved down there, I could get a blanket and sleep
Out on the beaches at night
(Where will i find you? What if i want you?)
Yeah, but, um, I'm used to being independent
I couldn't be put in a cage or anything
And besides, you'll never wait
(Yes, I will)
You say that now, but you don't really mean that
(I will, I promise I will)
