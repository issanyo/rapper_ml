[Verse 1: The Catalyst]
Good morning
They say I'm over the hill, but get real
Cause I ain't even 24 yet
It's a new day, bringing the heat to your doorstep
Get your alarm set
The way a nigga shine it can burn skin
I'm only growing brighter as the world spin
Up in the morning while you snoring in bed
I'm making moves on the come-up while you yawning instead
So late that when it dawned on you
I'm a bigger star than you
Somehow, I'll still probably be over your head
Cause it's my time
No, I mean, it's my time
And right now can't nothing else eclipse my shine
It's too colorful
As hard as artists try to recreate what I do
Can't duplicate, So I'm sonning you

[Hook]
I know you sleeping if you don't feel me
Gotta be sleeping if you don't feel me
East coast to worldwide
All sleeping if they don't feel me
I know you sleeping if you don't feel me

[Verse 2: Illogic]
I was shining, riding high for what it's worth
The words in my mouth were like sunlight to warm the earth
The world witnessed my rise so it was hard to hide
The brilliance that I projected from those piercing eyes
The horizon is my stage it's like I'm standing on the ocean
Now I'm floating free, my presence alone makes history daily
Everyone's a critic but it was easy to see
Without a doubt that the worlds revolve around me
At my peak, my zenith, every dream I had came true
Thus far, I mean, how many people become stars
This cycle is changing me I'm no longer the same
Just ninety-three million miles ahead of the game

[Hook]

[Verse 3: NP]
You see
It was all good just a week ago
So I need to know how can one cease to glow
I once reached a globe
[?]
Now they think son weak so they treat me cold
Feels like I have no choice
So I sink below
And fade to black
Like peace, I'm ghost
I laid my tracks
And brought heat to folks
But state the facts
You see, from the east I rose
Then I broke from my leash
So this beast could roll
My buzz would increase
Cause my streak was long
But the love I once received
Don't seem as strong
It's like they had enough of me
I can't believe it's gone

[Outro]
I couldn't believe it, just like that
Everything was gone, it was all over
He's gone, he's gone
Everything was gone
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone
Everything was gone
He's gone, he's gone
Everything was gone
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone
Everything was gone
