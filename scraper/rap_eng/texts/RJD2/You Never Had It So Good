I wanna give you the full regalia
No stone unturned to please this woman
So can you keep the buzzing to yourself?
'Cause when it starts Mr. Nice Guy's done

[Chorus]
Now I don't mind your mother's talk
Maybe I should
I really need your men to stop
You never had it so good

Now she can get plump off a beer and meatloaf
One lost a tooth, but kept a nice grin
Bought two pairs of shoes just for one weekend

[Chorus]
Now I don't mind your mother's talk
Maybe I should
I really need your men to stop
You never had it so good

We grew up quick
We get drunk quick
We got smart shoes quick
So lets slow down
We can ill afford to live alone

We grew up quick
We get drunk quick
We got smart shoes quick
So lets slow down
We can ill afford to live alone

[Chorus]
Now I don't mind your mother's talk
Maybe I should
I really need your men to stop
You never had it so good
