[Verse One: Jakki]
Jakki The Motamouth, the definition of raw
Go ahead and eat me, my worms will devour your jaw
You want the real shit?
Hold out your palms
Let me place my ass on 'em
I donate to the cause
I bet a whore wouldn't fuck with your easy metaphors
Set a course
To simple simile planet, you banished
I'm sick of hearing weak comparisons
I'll smack you dense
You fuck with me, I'll make your wack ass practice abstinence
You in the house? I'll go up in your crib and crash your turf
And show you I'll eat up your self esteem in mama's afterbirth
You gotta pile of tricks?
I got a pile of shit
I toss it at you like, "Here, go play with this while I rip."
I'll go to Heaven and bargain with God
For control of diplomas
Then stroll to Hell with a flying pig to freeze it over
You hard as fuck ain't you?
You walk your talk pal?
Snatch off your knee caps motherfucker...walk now
When I enter a room with a handful of goons
Swinging they rap like a bag of buffoons I bash 'em with brooms
Which one of y'all silly niggas think you can rock the mic?
I'll hit you with a box of 50,000 Copywrites
Throw your hardest punches at me, I'm still awake
The easiest way to sleep me is playing your tape
I'll crack your melon
Yo, might this child be outta place?
Kid I'm happiness repellent, wipe the smile right off your face
Lay a finger on Jakki, watch how I diss you
I'll possess your whole family and make your mama rip you
I'll follow you to your lovers house
Kick in the front door
Let one of my bitches beat your ass while I fuck yours
You praise the day the pain stops
(Jakki it's not working)
I'll rain on your parade with raindrops the size of Mercury
So bring the baddest nigga in your clique to open me
I'll throw a verse at him that'll have your whole wack crew quoting me

[Copywrite]
Christ Himself said I'm nice as hell
You 1/12th the fraction of my faction
I'm twice the scale
Your eyes will melt once I propel out wit
The hardest joint on your album would be our sell out shit
I distribute a poison, it's mixture of venom and vinyl
'MC' for you is a tentative title
Drop whatever primitive idol you worship
Learn to pray, tell you a virgin gave birth to a [?]
I'm [?] and turn the dictionary
Into the obituaries
My niche is to spit the odds beyond peons
And rock on the break of social security
The break of dawn is too premature for me
I bounce [?] towards Earth
Your head'll burst
And my mouth's motor runs at 12,000 mhz
You've got nowhere near what it takes to injury me
You not fit to change anyone who's name even begins with 'C'
So keep it down
We won't stoop to how you cretins sound
Me and the Motamouth will talk shit until our teeth are brown
Then freeze time and watch you age
It hurts for you to admit my birth marks the dawn of a new age

[Hook: Jakki (Copywrite)]
I got a proposal that'll cause disposal to sappy wide spread
If a rapper ain't a ten
(Then put a nine to his head)
Pull the trigger if he wack
(That'll cause a lot of strife)
Most rappers now-a-days couldn't be tight if they rapped for they life

[Verse Two: Copywrite]
You mention me?
You better jump a fence for me
After one verse, listeners acquire a chemical dependency
The rawest clique in history to rip a mic
Device so nice I walk the strip, looked up and caught a glimpse of Christ
Every pimp with ice I ever battled lost
They came fast to get they brain smashed to applesauce
If I don't get you, Motamouth will blow ya out
Two pedophiles with vulgar mouths, controlling bouts
You cats are gone once the track is on
When I catch wreck for the fifth time, you'll just be catching on
You ain't shit
I'll battle you and whoever my crew ain't with
This two brain clique's aerial bound, tearing it down
In silly ciphers, turn merry-go-rounds into burial grounds
Stay out the session when I'm lacing joints
Any suggestion to battle is out the question
Like an exclamation point

[Jakki]
Every time you attempt to throw a line, I will restrict 'em
You words are like your whole fucking advance cause I predict 'em
Is Jakki The Motamouth always that nice?
(You damn skippy)
A hundred minds throw punchlines at the same time, you still can't hit me
Crossing my path will have you repenting
Even one missed punch from me will have you eternally flinching
Even if you the craziest nigga you'll see pain
I'll simply keep pounding in senses until you plead 'sane'
Your tired approach you can consider history
You, your crew, even your mom and daddy ain't shit to me
I'll smack all MC's with one swing, I'm that raw
Lyrics always catch you cause they coming from a trapped jaw
Bring your technical diction
I'll improvise
Lace my words with acid and burn your brain till you simplify
It's so clear that I have no fear
Break into your crib, rob you
Show up the next day to battle in your gear
From A to Z
You can run down every word in the dictionary
And still not have enough to hang with me
Obey the laws? I'm much too stuck up
I'll rock the mic in a courthouse and tell the judge to shut the fuck up

[Hook: Copywrite (Jakki)]
