I know for certain, everything ain't right
I know for certain, everything ain't right
I know for certain, everything ain't right
Everyone
I know for certain, everything ain't right

[Verse One]
There was these two hoods hooded, footed in soldiers with tempers hot
Quick to simmer pots stewing beef
No true relief is to the team to a T, descriptions fit the profile
Niggas quick to throw down, forget a pro brown, state of mind is stakes inclined
They gotta get theirs too
A fall through the crevice in this preface to apocalypse
Forever on the ave when the bags full of consequence
Place your currency down and drown your misery
Master mundane, niggas in unchained, off of it
No alternates, so often it gets dirty in the trenches
Just occupational hazard, massive hustle, big doe is on the brain stem
Trying to step into the A.M
Just trying to cop product, no more potluck
Mouths open might as well eat good as each stood
Eager in the path to feel we laugh a lot
This meant to happen and let it, be in a blaze
Guns clapping like they Cassidy and Sundance
That's 'nuff plans
Till when the news came it wasn't news to nobody
Two bodies found slumped in front of an S-Class
Stripped to the marrow
Chicks in apparel
Ice went missing
Well listen real close
But listen real close

[Hook] {x2}
"I know for certain"
These are reason people die fo'
"Everything ain't right"
Cause life is survival
"I know for certain"
Certain things you try to keep my eye on
"Everything ain't right"
I could cry, but I won't

[Verse Two]
Daylight broke, they spoke subtle
Cuddle as one mass
Or two separate souls searching for love three dimensional
Orbiting like a binary star, haunted corners they move
Just losing sight of the baggage they always carry cause they packing light
Past relations managed like that dot com promotion
No more broken hope and rope a dope knock downs
Not this time
Our love was like a T.K.O
He whisper kissed her on her eyelids and bounced out
For another day at the J.O
No glamours, a custodial worker, none the less it pays so it's
Part of the plan, piling 'em out the lower end
Focused in on greener grass
Notions of a fam and a picket fence
Summer days innocent, just fishing with his son
They'll call him Dante, that's a while away
At least that's what he's thinking
Ironically, missus wondering why her cycle ain't came
But maintain composure to the store to gather proof
Before she goes jumping to conclusions she wanna be absolute
Later on that evening, money leaving out from work
With thoughts of a meal, a warm shower, and long hours with his ol' girl
But walking to the train he heard the guns pop
The stray bullet was someone else's name, it came for him
As he lay his last image it flashed by
Died before knowing he brought a baby boy into the world
