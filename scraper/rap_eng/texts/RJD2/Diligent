I'm a non-educated man staying faded when I can
Playing hooky slaying rookies staying crazy where I am
Though it may not seem that way checking back on my track won't blow you away
I lack certain things read up on my page
My laziness is crazy shit every day
They didn't know what to say or what to play to see me behave
Honestly their hate of my state caused me to lash out -

Get my parents to cash out

Making me a bad child
With no remedy for calamity
Needy, yelling feed me at 18
With no where to breathe easily
I guess it can be seen dropped on my head at age 3
No need to ask me, I'm dead when I read the answer key
Fans can see me dancing and prancing through life's mystery
Fighting history too easily
Letting kids become me and some be telling me to
STOP - which is probably for the best
I'm not grounded as solidly as any of the rest
They say it's all a test but I won't pass it
So I'll sit and zest while the green outlasts it
Heave it from my chest like a lyrical exorcist
Check my spirit crest and engage the SIKATRIKS
I'm sick-of-tricks, and this is your last kiss
From the spirit of death, know your excuse yet? Who said to write cheques if you're too dead to cash shit?

CHORUS

SET IT UP
TRY YOUR BEST
YOU'LL NEVER MAKE ME MAKE ME DILIGENT (X4)

KEEP IT UP AND
GRAB A FRIEND
JUST TRY TO MAKE ME DILIGENT (X4)

Intelligence is preference so I never make sense
On the fence between offense and defense
Can't defend against my pretense
So don't pretend like my will is weakened
My skill is freedom, and it has begun
To see some thing's that sing across my kingdom
It seems obscene that no one see's my fiendom
So now I write raps, record track, and release them
Scratch that, whack-ass, fake raps they feed you
No class and content makes their shit see through
Check the real facts then set back the channel
Or let the fat cats roll while you simply stand still
Oh now the pills will start to effect
And my consciousness reverts to defects
No longer dissect any of life's interests
And my weakness creeps out a death wish
Scream in need of material excess
Just please don't accept what you must reject
Anyways
I forgot to explain
The whole first verse
And what I was saying
Basically I spent my whole life playing
Dreaming incoherent I don't wanna be famous
But all these people try to tell me it's painless
That they all made it by trying out the same shit
Many years passed before it was clear
That everything I've done has been out of fear
What a strange world I now perceive
Craving fangs now draining trees
With no way to properly thank and please
With no police to protect and serve
I could corrupt herds with every word
But I must resist this tempting verse
Sikatriks lives for the earth
So I'll always give my fighting burst
Though by now I'm starting to strain
Drained my brain now I don't know my own name
But I'm on the third page
Carting up the bird cage
Heart can't keep up with these absurd ways
Dark in the park of suburban play
So few things that I haven't faced
No way that I'll ever be on top of the game
"I'm just too indifferent" that's what they all say
Referring to pass exams and monotone court dates
Never give back to the graves that relax

More than a game, please set the tax and
Admit the addicts into another pack (pact)
Some call it rehab some take to relax
No short to relapse go run some laps
Look at this big gap that we created
All these famous first class birthing babies

While I simply try just to hold the essence
No point in guessing based on your perspective
Just call me dumb, I'll straight reflect it
May have failed the class but pass all the life lessons
