When I'm alone in my home, sometimes I cover my face
The walk around in circles at a slow pace
It's my attempt to erase
The feeling that I'm standing in place
At my 9-to-5 I teach computers to be clever
So they can replace you and do the job better
Never say never
Corporate America is out to save cheddar
Computer programming ain't about creation
It ain't about videogames or playstations
It ain't about making new jobs or innovation
It's about automation
And permanent vacations
Just the other day
My boss fires some cat that worked a thousand miles away
There wasn't nothing I could say
It was sad to see but I was glad it wasn't me
50 years of experience dependable
One merger, one meeting, expendable
I know it seems unbelievable
They used to kiss your ass, but now they don't need you

You ever thought about when you'll be out of here?
Nice job, nice car, still: out of here!
Middle management downsize, then out of here
Some shit that I ain't tryin to hear

Fuck the job... for real!

The best time in my career was at the start
I was working extra hours, pouring out my little heart
Now is hard for me to care
When I know I'm just a resource in somebody's chart
Staring at a corporate ladder I can't climb
Contributing to milestones and bullshit baselines
Ten hours a day wasting time
Trying to cut fat from my company's waistline
I want y'all to listen
They spend 50K just to say 50 Million
They hire me to cut labor in divisions
Less for you, less for your children

You ever thought about when you'll be out of here?

I've seen a lot of people come and go
Seen a lot of people sit around complaining about doe
I've seen people get hired and then get a new car, bragging
And when it got tight, I've seen them brown bagging
I've seen people hire for jobs I wouldn't touch
While being denied for jobs I really want
I've seen cats being promoted and demoted like chunks
Loose confidence, then resign the next month
I've seen people close to tears because they got bad reviews
Walking to your cube and start interrogating you
20 questions arguing and bitching
Mad about the money you make in your position
I've seen women with kids stay in one spot
I've seen women without kids rise to the top
Seen them comming and buddy up with the managers
Then seen the same women move up the ladder
I've seen women stand still when they work twice as hard
While men work half as hard and get twice as far
