You had such a pleasant evening
And I was happy to oblige
If we both feel great about things
Why's it not the time?

In my early years
I was terrified
Now I'm a grown man
I see it would be so nice

[Chorus]
Just when, just when?
I don't mean to push the issue
There's no young'uns without you
Just when, just when?
I need a little one to pass the name on
Before I'm dead and gone

Now we both like sunsets and scented candles
And this'll only hurt a long time from now
All the housework I can handle
You can just try motherhood out
We could be a family
Love some family planning

[Chorus]
Just when, just when?
I don't mean to push the issue
There's no young'uns without you
Just when, just when?
I need a little one to pass the name on
Before I'm dead and gone

In my early years
I was terrified
Now I'm a grown man
I see it would be so nice

Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Just when, just when?
I don't mean to push the issue
There's no young'uns without you
Just when, just when?
I need a little one to pass the name on
Before I'm dead and gone
