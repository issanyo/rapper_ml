[Intro]
To be honest, man
I just wanna rhyme for a bit
Body this beat while we here
Prologue

[Verse 1]
Just woke up from the American Dream
Dazed and confused on what intelligence means
The only emcee who plays truth and dare with a page
Every phrase bringing light to his terrible ways
The POC with a d-o-t on his head
They want him dead, though he only communicates common sense
Stop the press, the man’s woke
No
I take a faux foe and leave ‘em lacking oxygen
Please don’t try to tackle me, my style’s unique
You ain’t seen the type of variety that I can bring
Yeah, I’m of a different class, got the gift of gab
Drifting back to when graffiti began to be plastered, and these masters were spitting phat
Quit the bad rap, you rapscallion, I wrap maggots in rings
The beat’s slappin, I be slappin’ up these candidates for nonsense
The kid’s a monster
Leave ‘em all just smack dab in the middle for karma to get ‘em
This is merely a warm-up, be ready for that one tape
Man’s beasting, the fans feasting at the buffet
Have to do what I have to do
Drop something fierce on ya like I’m Lakitu
Rhymes that you shall adore, words so Salvador
Tunes for the new listeners and the connoisseurs
I’m a force to be reckoned with, to foes who can’t step to me
Go is what I recommend before you’re dead
Giving ‘em that elixir, I be rocking your dome
Remain concocting the philosopher’s stone
Jon in the zone, he be popping as he plot the unknown
So versatile, now I’mma be swapping the tone
Check it

[Verse 2]
Outlier, not an outcast
Spout fire, make the crowd gasp
About time that the lout raps
Ain’t a secret what the doubt cast
Yo, did my hour pass?
Associating with the brown sands in the hourglass (c’est la vie)
Will I outlast feeling downcast?
Should I throw shade at what the cloud casts?
Lambasting the sheep
Do I hold over them what they can’t even reach?
They dance to the beat
Should I let ‘em slide, putting hands to their knees?
Is it time to get pensive or let the pen sever?
Men quiver at the sight of the killer when he’s writing
M. Bison, yes I am a mammoth
Tell me how my leftovers killing all these rappers
John Nash to an amateur or an academic
This is lyrical calisthenics, madder than the Hatter, yeah
Paramedics at the premises, what a bloody scene
It’s destiny when I act a vision out, not the company
Hate the cats making crap, the game’s an actual litter box
Y’all don’t think outside the box, making hits for box
I’m an east side boy, no Lil’ Jon
Got the whole crowd going up and down, 6 o’clock
I ain’t the rest of them when I’m the best of them
My intentions are nebulous, emphasis on the messages
In my element, and it’s only track two
Don’t ink on my body of work, this ain’t tattoos
Apothecary to the gaggle
And you’re lookin’ like a fraggle tryna grapple with young Rambo
Everyday, I hit ‘em with the nice lines
Check the tapes, you’re sitting at the sidelines
Tryna make change, shouldn’t pay you no mind
‘Cause that’d be the biggest payment you’d get in your life
Yada yada yada, thought you learned from mistakes
The beef ain’t rare, but you’ll be burned at the stake
Oh, god forgive me, I’m back on it
Dag gone it, I gotta be admonished
I’m transforming into that lad, aren’t I?
You can’t visualize the gamut
How my leftovers be killing all these rappers?
Grateful like Khaled to be standing here today
I may seem fearless, but I’m insecure, no Issa Rae
Hey, never take it all for granted if you wanna stay planted
I’m just being candid
Yeah
