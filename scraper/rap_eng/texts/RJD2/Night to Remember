[Intro: Blueprint]
E'rybody shakin they ass, in this shit
Dancin, uh-huh, this what I'm talkin 'bout
So many women (shake it)
So little time, I love 'em all though (hah)
Can't front (yeah)
Love single (uh-huh)
Lookin fine

[Blueprint]
I met this chick up in the scribble, B-girls turn me on
The vibe of the song was bangin in my ear
I can barely hear but my vision's very clear
C'mere, she came, responded with Elaine as her name
White dame with a nice frame
(Damn) I'm feelin a light pain
She said she made the drive from LaGrange
Just to see my show cause I had a lot of fame
I said, "Word, that's good to hear
Don't tell me your man left you alone in here
And if he did that's kinda foul
Knowin guys like me are always on the prowl"
She cracked a smile then grabbed my butt
And said, "What makes you think that's not what I really want?"
(Oooh) Girl I got the keys to the van
Plus a hour to spare if you ain't playin
Forget hip-hop, forget about your man
If you're cool with this then grab my hand
Forget this rap shit girl
If you're cool with this then grab my hand

[Hook: Blueprint]
Let's make this a night to remember
We only live once, no need to front
You're feelin me? (True) I'm feelin you too
So I don't need to say what we need to do
Let's make this a night to remember
We only live once, no need to front
You're feelin me? (True) I'm feelin you too
So I don't need to say what we need to do (uh-uh)
I don't need to say what we need to do (uh-uh)
I don't need to say what we need to do (uh-uh)
Just me and you.. just me and you

[Blueprint]
Uh, word
There's a spot called Rhino's where everybody goes
Have a couple of drinks, forget about your woes
It's not really a spot to meet skirts
Cause almost everybody there works where I work
But one night it was kind of different
I spotted this hot chick, at the end of the bar lookin THICK
Black girl, shinin like a black pearl
I'm thinkin - she checkin me out but I really can't tell
And right before I get up the nerve to speak
She walks up and asks me to join HER for drinks
I told her that I don't really drink a lot
She laughed, and ordered up four rounds of shots
One shot, two shot, three shot, four
One more shot and I'll be earlin on the floor
I knew I would be hurtin the next day
But I will get bent if it gets me laid
Twenty minutes later she's on some shit
Sayin she's an exhibitionist with a set of fierce tits
I told her that's what I like to hear
But if it's really true she should pull 'em out right there
She was down for hers, I ain't playin
She pulled out her D-cups and put 'em in my hands
I knew it was time to get it poppin
So what she said next wasn't all that shockin

[Hook]

[Outro: Blueprint]
Yo, this is the part of the song where
You gotta grab the girl next to you
Say "Yo, what's up shorty?
You tryin to dance or what? I damn sure am"
I ain't even rap no more
We gon' let this beat ride for a minute so you can go for yours
Like this {*RJD2 starts scratching in background*}
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
Yeah, shake it, shake it up
Go for yours, don't be shy
This what I'm talkin 'bout
Blueprint, Soul Position, RJD2 on the tracks
Not what you thought, right?
It's me though, uh-huh, yeah
Keep dancin, song ain't over yet
We just gon' let it ride, do your thing
Uh-huh uh-huh... YEAH!
