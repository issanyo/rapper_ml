[Verse 1]
I don't believe in sin
And neither do you (neither do you)
I can't begin to see
The thin line between what I do and you do
Fool once had thought that he
Never need you (never need you)
Fall in the water
But you'll go up faster than we could have ever knew

[Chorus]
Caught between what I know (what I know)
What I still not understand (understand)
Little man has got my heart (my heart)
In his dirty little hands (little hands)
Caught between what I know (what I know)
What I still not understand (understand)
Little man has got my heart (my heart)
In his dirty little hands (little hands)

[Verse 2]
You came like a boat from the sky
And entered my heart (and entered my heart)
You wiped out the memory
Of who I was before you were born
Focused on old man stars
You didn't know (you didn't know)
Cleaned out the cobwebs
Turned off the lights and left the place looking whole

[Chorus]
Caught between what I know (what I know)
What I still not understand (understand)
Little man has got my heart (my heart)
In his dirty little hands (little hands)
Caught between what I know (what I know)
What I still not understand (understand)
Little man has got my heart (my heart)
In his dirty little hands (little hands)
