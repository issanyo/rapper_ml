[O,o,o]Okay. This is the first record I've made under my own name
The first one I've made under my own control entirely without anyone else telling me what to do in certain places
Some of the stuff I like very much. Some of the stuff I quite like. and I don't hate any of it, so I've settled for this... music
I can't decide which piece to start with, so I won't start with any of [the piece, i've already started.]
I hope you like what you hear [hear,hear,hear,hear,hear...]
