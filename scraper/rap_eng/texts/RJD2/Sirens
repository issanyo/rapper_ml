(So beautiful, but so deadly
I don't know what's compelling me
Drawn by the cry of the sirens melody)


Their using sorcery to torture me
It's like their dousing me in oil then  they torch my feet
Open flame where soul roasting slowly
But now its burning to hot to control the heat

...Despite the metaphor
I'm feelin' colder than the holdin's where they store the beef
Their Cry Is ill advised for the weak
Its beginning now to mental toll on me

They're beauty is just so elite
I'm sure they know I'm so intrigued
Their in the soul biting industry
And all got quotas to report on quarterly

I admit a bit of hyperbole
Got to quit with the spittin' bitter poetry
Then maybe they'll notice that's there's more to me
Then these dudes trying to court them cordially

Please don't take this for misogyny
You'd amazed by the range that your charm can reach
Only peevish cause it works on me
But I would never blame you for a thing


Wishing I was real for a minute (but)
Distant in defense of my spirit (got)
Tough skin but they know how to pierce it (I)
Don't know what love is but I fear it

(Now) scared of these temptresses testing me
They'll most definitely sure get the best of me
It's all a game where they break me to pieces;
I call for ref but there ain't no penalty

Fair call but I'm still scared mentally
Maybe salty cause I'm never on the winning team
On the side lines dwelling on the failing streak
I'm just not cut for these major leagues

It's my Sanity I fail to keep
Mind aches as I'm questioning everything
Buggin' out man I probably need therapy
Feeling more dead than ever let me rest in peace

Cause I'm my own worst enemy
And it's all in my head but it gets to me
.But I don't want them to change a thing
So let me here the voice of that siren sing
