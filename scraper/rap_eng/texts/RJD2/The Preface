[Intro]
Ooooh, low day
I'm drinking lukewarm tea, bitch
Check it

[Verse 1]
She's got
One eye shut while she's fast asleep
The other eye's wide open
And hoping it sees me, sweet pea
She's lost in between her dreams
And Venetian blinds' shadows from those headlight beams
It's a theme
I'll waft in out on my own
Headphones send the rhythm through my temple of bones
My son get the phone
Pause it with the message from home
But I don't face it, I'll replace it
With this beverage I hold

[Verse 2]
And it's cold
But I ain't getting warmer
This alcohol makes me
Feel like a transformer
Like I could turn into a plane
And jet across the border
But I won't
Cause she's counting
On me to support her
And I'm counting on
Three dollars and two quarters
And I'm-a make it stretch
Cause I'm  a dollar store warrior
Noise here
They know my peaceful surroundings
I'm drowning
And all I can hear is my heart pounding
Scrounging my pockets
For change and for dust
There is only a guitar pick
And some cigarette butts
I'm bust
Stand up and shake off the rust
Cause it hurts when I see you
Look at me with disgust
I say 'baby'
'Can't you see I'm doing this for us?'
But how much longer can I truly
Ask her to trust
Readjust
It's time for me to make a move
And follow in the footsteps
Of my heroes' hoof proof

[Verse 3]
(You can do anything that you want)
Now it's five in the morning
And the sun's  coming up
It's a brand new day
And I'm excited as fuck
Get up, get up all of y'all
Please stand up
Watch me rip off my shirt
And tip over the trunk
With my two bare hands
I'm gonna switch up this luck
It's my time to shine
And I'm tearing shit up
Cause I'm that type of cat
Who could never get stuck
I am not gonna sit around
Cause I'm not a sitting duck
Plan of action
Slip on the boots for more traction
Demand satisfaction
From those cats that I'm passing
I'm asking one time
And one time only
Do you like what I do?
Cause if not, you can blow me
Well show me
Why I shouldn't follow my dreams
You'll read about me
In Rolling Stone magazines
There's one thing missing
From all of y'all souls
Turn off the Hip Hop
And crank up Rock and Roll

[Verse 4]
And I'm left shaking
From all of my decision making
Pretty soon the rest of this town
Will  all start waking
Usual grind
They'll be raking and ageing
Out from nine to five
That I remain  evading
Cause if I'm not shaking
Leave me vacant and spacing
And it gets heavy
My lungs start aching
My heart is racing
From these demons I'm chasing
And I know
That there's no time left to be wasting
So I'm about to pack
My life up in a bag
And tie it to a stick
With a ripped red rag
Catch a spaceship
Head on  a cosmic path
With a one way ticket
Cause I'm not coming back
What I leave behind
Will be messages for you
You can steal 'em if you want, or buy 'em from iTunes
I zoom
To a planet
Far far away
And that's
The day
They'll say

(He was right!)
(Everything he said was, was right!)
(My god)
(We should have listened to him!)
(He was right)
(All along)
