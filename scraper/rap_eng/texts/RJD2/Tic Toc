[Hook]
Sometimes I envy my best friend for being dead
Feeling sorry for myself, wishing that it was me instead
Sometimes I wanna cry, sometimes I wanna die
Almost everyone I love is in the sky, can't help to wonder why
Same game but I'm gonna reset it
And every ex who ever dumped me is gonna regret it
So you say I've got a fucked up aura
You just remain innocent, I fucked up for ya

[Verse 1]
Forrest Gump, I'm in it for the long run
Feels like time's suspended while the song runs
The Earth's freezing, so quiet I can hear a bird sneezing
But I'm freezing out here, but I'm tryin'a make it a different season out here
What's your reason out here?
I wrote a few new campfire chants
Guaranteed to make a few vampires dance
Damn right anti-stab
Meet at the camp side as I burn my advance
On the curb by the branch till it burns right to ash
Booked to the future but learned by my past
Tell the world I am mad and we're not on speaking terms
Maybe in a week I learn, lately I've been needing a burg
Going crazy I'mma need some church

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now I lay myself down to sleep
At thirty-thousand feet, the Earth's down beneath
What I'm looking around to see
I parachute miles above the clouds
I'm coming down smarting up before I dumb it down
Centrum, depends on the ground, how far it gets, how hard I hit
Tic toc and you don't stop or we can go up at a friend that I quit now won't cop
Tic tic or you don't quit
Today I owe my dealer and a friend made a bet with a whole lot
Quit tryin'a figure out what changes people
I say famous egos go to nameless zeros
In a race against time and I don't even know what I'm running for
I'm just doing it cause I'm fucking bored
No reason to lie, give me one of yours
Try cover up my lies, no cover tour

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Here's where Copy goes beserk, hold your perks
Now only being sober works, oh for sure
Next week you'll be phoning jerks
Check out what the price goes for perps
Maybe but uhh, what if I'm wrong, what if you're right
Pat yourself on the back and get my butt up to fight
I won't shut up in life I know too well what struggle is like
Go change you, I got angels
My dad is a left, my mother's a right
Dad's left cause he left and my mother was right
She told me "never quit" you'll discover the light
Remember the end of the tunnel with the sun in my sight
I see clearly when I'm deep in thought she hears me
And she talks back to me, it's no weird theory
I'm just waiting to meet up with her with no clock
To the to the tic tic you don't stop

[Hook]
