[Hook]
Out here something's wrong in my halo
I hear monsters under my bed
Keep a pistol next to my pillow
Oh those monsters better beware
You make your bed you go lay in it
You make your bed you lay in it
You make your bed you go lay in it
You make your bed you lay in it

[Verse 1]
Uh uh, flashbacks of my past raps
Before we got ass [?]
Where we used to stash gats
From po' where the trash at
A chase for the fat stacks
On pace to make mad racks
Not that I'm a bad guy
I just found what I'm good at
Hood rats things with my friends
Give again
Smoking blunts during lunch
Skipping class on a hunt for a means to make ends
Papa never drove a Benz
Played the lotto every night
Can't remember if he'd win
Guess he didn't
I ain't trippin'
I ain't wishin' on a star
I was different than my niggas in the kitchen whippin' hard
Pimpin' broads breaking hoes
Treat your nose
Ice cold
Nice clothes
Light gold
Sell a dream
Buy a soul
Coppin' blow
Many skank
Life [?]
Might think that I can't feel remorse for the choice and the voices in my head
Sounds like monsters under beds
Let my past come to haunt me if it want me
I ain't scared

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Uh, unholy night
Walkin' jeepers creepers and grim reapers
Skeletons in my closet
Demons come out to meet you
No [?] no horror features and don't do no scary flicks
Sometimes I feel like my mind be playing tricks
Cause at night I can't sleep
I toss and I turn
Candlesticks on my wall
Pictures of bodies being burned
To fill up them urns
You get what you earn
You live and you learn
Until it's your turn
When you got no place to run and there ain't nowhere to hide
You got to face all your demons
You might look death in the eye
Either you pack up your pussy or you get up off your hide
You got to do what you must when it's a must you survive
But in turn we live life on the edge
Where it's said if you make it past 25 you know how to play it
You can say it if you think them Hail Marys might help
But I recommend a couple extra shells on the shelf
Me myself

[Hook to fade]

GO!
