I took a bite, forbidden fruit wasn't even ripe
Now I'm just graffiti sprayed on the wall of life
People walking by, paying no attention
To the written splitting image of a non living poltergeist
Vandalism, disrespected, and defaced
Unaccepted so they try to get me replaced
Life's grip tries to get a hold of me
I made my mark, now they're painting over me
I'm getting older, moldy and forgotten
While no one on the block stares or cares to even notice me
People smile it up while me? I'm getting frowned upon
Looking up while these people looking down upon
Me, I try to live this nightmare as I chase my dreams
I catch em, but trying to keep em is a face unseen
And I'm in a crowd, people pass me now
This life's building is about to come crashing down
And as we're all about to fall in any second
Every body rushes towards the one and only exit
Now everybody's tipping like an over flowing cup
But sometimes, the only way to go is up
Nobody uses elevators cuz they're fearing that they'll drop
But I'm running towards the closest one to push the arrow at the top

Chorus:
Everybody's pulling me and holding down my confidence
Ya'll going down? Well I'm tryna do the opposite
This double negative ain't coming out positive
If life is falling, I'ma come out on top of it
