Didn't you tell me it was all about you
To love respect you is all I gotta do
Disconnect you is somethin that I never thought
How can we learn, from a lesson that was never taught
Man I had so many plans for us
I was hopin that you could save the last dance for us
I never ever leave you in the sandy dust
But trust me, baby I'm the man to trust
I won't call you up, I won't act a fool
Or bring drama to your party, baby that ain't cool
Everyone knows if you snooze you lose
I'm just tryin to figure out if you heard the news
Livin your life is at an all-time high
Don't know why but I think I want that
It ain't cracked up to what it's 'posed to be
And I can love you to death but I'll never come back

[Hook]
I can love you to death but I'll never come back
I'll never come back, I'll never come back
I can love you to death but I'll never come back
To see how love was, and how it does us
I can love you to death but I'll never come back
Never come back, I'mma never come back
I'mma love you to death but I'll never come back

[Aceyalone]
What do I gotta do to let you know
It's harder and harder for me to just let go
I'd rather be lonely than just live low
Pullin somebody's strings, I don't think so
What do I look like, caught up in some feud
Ho if you wanna build I got brain food
Know I'll do anything to get you in the mood
But sellin myself sho't, I ain't that dude
Wonder what it'd cost to buy your dreams
Open you up so you could try new things
They call me the candy man, but you ice cream
Speadin my love girl, you're under my wings
One of these days I'mma just go home
And follow that flow to the end of the track
World ain't free as it's supposed to be
And I can love you to death but I'll never come back

[Hook]

[Aceyalone]
Ain't it funny all the games they play
Give you the green light, and take it all away
Show me a good sign, I'll show you a star
Show me who you love, I'll show you who you are
How many thin lines do we gotta cross
To find our way back or take it as a loss
All that glitter and gloss won't even cost
So how you gonna tell me how to do it when you're not the boss
Who is the real you you don't even claim
The person inside me, that ain't near been the same
Farmer will come, but she won't say her name
Comin to rescue us fears from the pain
One of these things that I got in my head
You made yo' bed, so lay where it's at
I wish I had more than all of me to give
And I can love you to death but I'll never come back

[Final Hook]
I can love you to death but I'll never come back
I'll never come back, I said I'll never come back
I can love you to death but I'll never come back
To see how love was, and how it does us
I can love you to death but I'll never come back
I'll never come back, I said I'll never come back~!
... To see how love was, and how it does us
