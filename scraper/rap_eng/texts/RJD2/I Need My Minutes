Yeah... who's this callin my cell?
Talkin in a high pitch like Pharrell
Damn I shoulda known it had to be my girl
She told me that she had a quick story to tell
So the next thing I know, she got me stuck on the phone
With a story that really didn't make sense
Talkin long, goin on and on
What, two hours wasted?
Girl you know you trippin
You know I got your back when you need me to listen
But it took too long for your story to finish
And you got me usin up all of my "anytime" minutes
... What's wrong wit'chu?
Don't you know I got a couple songs to do?
Every bill I got is overdue
Now I'm runnin up my phone bill because of you
Yeah, it's sad but true
Raise your hand if the same thing has happened to you
People wanna call you up out of the blue
Killin all your minutes just to holler at you

[Hook]
I need my minutes, I need my minutes
Back up off my minutes bitch, raise up off my minutes
I need my minutes, I need my minutes
Back up off my minutes bitch, raise up off my minutes

[Interlude]
Hello? (Yeah man, this is uh, Sam man)
Yeah what's up? (Just, y'know, seeing what you up to, just)
Yeah just chillin man, uh what's up wit'chu?
(Oh nothin man, I ain't doin shit, I just)
Oh nothin? (Yeah, naw I ain't doin nothin)
Yeah umm (Just wanna holla at you though)
So what's goin on, what you hit me up for?
(Man, I don't know, I'm just bored)
You know it's 3 o'clock? (Oh, y'know)
It's day man, this shit's expensive, right?
(Oh you wanna holla at me man?)
I'll holla at you later (alright)

[Blueprint]
I understand that you wanna talk to me
But Verizon Wireless is doggin me
Don't you know that weekend and nights are free?
So if it ain't one of those don't holler at me
That's just reality man
So there's really no need to be mad at me man
You runnin your mouth like we family man
You need to enroll in a family plan
Cause time is money, literally
And last I checked man you live on my street
Still callin my cell to kick it with me?
You can walk two blocks and we can kick it for free
'Fore I go let me break it down
If I don't pick it up then I'm not in the town
I'm probably in the studio layin around
It just cost too much to waste time wit'chu clowns

[Hook]

[Outro: Blueprint]
WHAT? Back up!
Talk too much, callin me night and day!
WHAT? BACK UP! Tryin to save my minutes!
Y'all know what it is, I'm mad
Verizon got me mad, had to switch to T-Mobile
You big mouth people, callin me, all hours of the day
Wanna talk about NOTHIN, blah blah!
Only got a thousand minutes a month
Y'all wanna call me at, 5 PM, talk for three hours
Call me at 9, weekends are free
Cell phone too hot, make me wanna yell, choke somebody out
Run up my, phone! WHAT?
I need my minutes! {*echoes*}
