LOVE

I see your face shrouded in a laugh
Cloaked in love that I had
But didn't get back
Romanticizing my past
Because things look better through this view
8mm me, 8mm you
So playful, but was it really like this?
I fight this urge to be a lifeless blur
Living with what I have now - that's emptiness
You on the magazine cover but I'm not envious
Because I inspired you to follow your dreams
Then you realized your dreams didn't have any room for me
So I'm doomed to sleep alone on the bed we bought together
But at least I'll remember us forever, in my

TIME

Starting over, I'm back like i never been
Hate everything i made, so how could i be arrogant?
I'm getting older, trying to set shit straight
Spitting harder because i got more candles on the cake
Looking back, seems further than it might be
It's unlikely but it feels like life be the icing
That was too sweet didn't get eaten
Bottom of the trash - it gave cockroaches something to believe in
But I'd never kill time, I've made love to it gently
So imagine my surprise when i found that it left me
Gone forever, with no note
Just some footage to watch while i sit here and soak in these

LIFE

And I'm from the acting capital where they acting for capital
So don't act like you ain't acting because we're all actors after all
We just more honest about it so the camera screams louder
And as the years pass and they seeming like hours
Pixels engrave our loved ones make us prouder
Because soon all our graves will be covered in flowers
And like cows that graze lazily before being devoured
We stay slaves rather than paying the price for power
Ideas over ideals, art feeds us, but it got us owing them bills
Our leaders speak words coated in thrills, cheap ones
Longing for conformist love, cheap puns, and

FATE

I was caught in the traps set for me
Poor souls writing scrolls that say rest in peace
Dead to me, dead to them
End goal is detrimental, let go of the echoes
Let them envelope my other self's every step
While the real me is swimming in this emptiness
And if i ever felt worthy of praise it was a mistake
I lay awake in the bed i made, so stay fake
Stay carbon copy charred and ugly
Par the course failed the course? call it costly
Love and robbery, take what i want, I'm stoic
Stab a coward in the back
To be heroic in my
