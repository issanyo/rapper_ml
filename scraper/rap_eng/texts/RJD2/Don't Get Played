[Hook]
Maybe it's reason
Maybe it's season
For falling in love
Maybe I'm dreamin'
But I still believe in
In falling in love
Now I've been doing some drinkin'
And doing some thinkin'
Of all the above
And maybe this time might be that time I don't get played (No, no, no, no...)
And maybe this time might be that time I don't get played (No, no, no, no...)

[Verse 1]
You scared, so you scared, shorty
Uh, Take off your cool, it's a bare as you dare party
You know the rules, when you love and you care about somebody
Only a fool wants a life you can't share with nobody
Uh, nigga take a bar and think about it
Uh, hit the bar and have a drink about it
Cause I've been here before
I opened up that door
And ain't no turnin' back
When people get attached
Emotions get involved
Like rollercoasters, y'all
It's all smiles and giggles
Until that first fall
And if we break up and don't make up
Who gets the dog?
Am I moving too fast?
Hope I ain't losing yo' ass
If I do than just ask, we slow it down, down
Just ask, we slow it down

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I once had a lover
She dunce-capped a brother
Put me on time-out to ride out
With some other fucker
Well motherfuck her
I ain't gon' cry about it
Although I did when it happened
I ain't gon' lie about it
I know that pains' a part of life
You ain't alive without it
And what don't kill you make you stronger
I ain't gon' die about it
Shit, get high about it
Get out and go for yours
Remember God closes windows to open doors
And them open sores
They heal with time
Nowadays, tattoo removal scars ain't hard to find
To say that you forgive someone might the hardest line
To steal a heart, and breaking apart may be the hardest crime
It happened before, but never again, I'mma war with mine
At God with mine
