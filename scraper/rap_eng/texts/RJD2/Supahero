[Aceyalone]
Uhhh, uh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
C'mere baby let me talk to you
Uh, RJ let me tell you somethin
Better yet let me ask you somethin
What is it that you want?
Cause I know you say a lot of different things in a lot of different ways
But I ain't got no S on my chest and I ain't Superman
I'm not. I'm just me, check it out

[Chorus: Aceyalone]
Baby I'm your star, but you lookin for a superhero
And Superman don't fly no more cause he ain't one with the people
Baby I'm your star, but you lookin for a superhero - and he ain't there
He ain't nowhere to be found cause he should be fightin evil

[Aceyalone]
I want to love you, cause that's my duty
It's not your booty, it's not your beauty
You're not just a cutie you make me whole
It's not the movies where they fake the role
I try to take control, for the sake of soul
But the only thing I get to do is scrape the bowl
When God made me he said break the mold
And put foot to the concrete to shake the road
I don't have powers like a Caped Crusader
But I do got powers like an Ace Invader
Back in the days he had so much flavor
He was so major to get you out of danger
Now you can't find him and he's just a stranger
And if you did he'd probably give you the finger
You hit channel zero on your channel changer
And your hero with a lifesaver threw you an anchor

[Chorus]
[Aceyalone]
Yeah baby love, and maybe love
A joke or a fairytale, one of the above
I really don't know what you thinkin of
I can't make a web from underneath my glove
I can't see through walls but I can see through you
You dress up the doll but that's all you do
You fell for him, he didn't fall for you
I'm just me, that's all I got to offer you
I don't save the day, I just pave the way
In the city of Gotham another day's a day
I know it pays to play, but I ain't playin
I ain't layin my coat down, know what I'm sayin?
You want lots of muscles and lots of green
But my hustle and bustle is my only thing
It ain't at all bad as my last song seems
You need a star in your life and not in your dreams

[Chorus x2]
[Aceyalone]
Breakdown
Yeah you know I could do it but
Right now my cape is in the cleaners
But as soon as I get it out I'ma get at you
Yeah
Cause I can be everything you want, anything you need
Yeah baby, anything you need
I'm it, I'm the shit
Yeah, pure, unadulterated, beyond a shadow of a doubt, perfection
That's me
But you lookin for a superhero
Ain't one with the people
I'm perfectly flawed
