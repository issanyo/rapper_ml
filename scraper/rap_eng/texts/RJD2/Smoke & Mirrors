[Hook]
Who knows what tomorrow will bring?
Maybe sunshine and maybe rain
But as for me, I'll wait and see
Maybe it'll bring my love to me, who knows

[Hook]
Who knows what tomorrow will bring?
Maybe sunshine and maybe rain
But as for me, I'll wait and see
Maybe it'll bring my love to me, who knows

[Bridge]
Sometimes I feel rainy days
Just to let you know everything's gonna be
Alright, alright
