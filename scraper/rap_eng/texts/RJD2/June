RJD2 drop that shit so I can drop my thoughts
Driftin away, and depress all within listening range
Nah but for real I got so much shit on my mind
From fake motherfuckers to my future I'm trying to get in line
And doing hip hop in this life in time ain't all nice and fine
At times I feel like my whole life's a rhyme
Full of punchlines and jokes
Fuck ups and punches
It's like I just can't get shit right the first time or something
When no one knows your name, your vinyl's still in stores
Once you get a little light they're arguing over who feels it more
We got sixteen year old net heads buying garbage
Wanting to keep you from their personal private artists
We don't do shit for the clubs
As far as 45s go
RJ's the archaeologist diggin em up
And I'm the saint sent
To vinyl with cassettes to bash
In this for life until my final mic check is cashed

Yo
I can't fully become my mother's guiding light
Till my dad returns to tell me what the other side is like
I keep the things you taught trapped in mind
I know you cared even though you weren't here half the time
But who am I to blame
I'd probably do the same in your shoes
I never held that against you
Complained or assumed
You never went through what I'm living
Hell who am I kidding?
Depression is practically
Part of family tradition
So I keep the time we shared close
It sucks to lose
It also sucks we had to share the month of june
I would've shared eternal time before I left
Each month I celebrate my birth
I'm reminded of your death
