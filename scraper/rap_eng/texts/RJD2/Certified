I dont believe youre ready for this
Are you ready for this?
We'd like to capture your minds right now
Take you a little bit higher
With a little black rock

Rock it, rock
Rock it, rock
Rock is so
Yo

Rock is so neo for my people. This cerebral law, bleed and fought
Brought on by my alter ego, I halt like the desert eagle
We talk the crust feeble minded motherfuckers
Uncover they gliss cause it's not on your wrist
Givin' you somethin' to twist up
Lift up and breath in, I let it resonate
Elevate you like smoke that broke through heaven's gate
Some estimate that I can take it wherever it leaves me
This ain't easy but I'm steady gettin' my elbows greasy
Puttin' my back in it
Accent it with facts in it. This a reality
Radically left wing and my next, breedin' with sex
Gs and inanimate objects, with prospects and movements
Supreme, you said yourself. Who else would I represent?
While time leavin' evidence, I'm conceivin' the head of it
Receivement try to see me at eye to eye level
With 6 shots pumpin' plots, fierce to pierce metal
Your armor no match for me. Understandably so

Yo
Who wanna test the levels of their versify?
Spinnin' the earth and search beneath it where the purpose lies
Ready to dance under the pale moonlight
You'll soon find what you're dealing with significantly certified
Who wanna test Mr. "Three-I-Versify"?
Your whole notions in this thing have been commercialized
Ready to dance under the pale moonlight
You'll soon find

I verbalize surface ties and merchandise theory
Clearly open their threshold to expose my expos√©
Obey your thirst, a simple page of verse, refreshingly dope
Indelibly soaked up on rush confusion
My enterprise identifies the city skies and urban manifestos
Rose up through the chaos to shake plots and pose
Visions enclosed in a globe spinnin', I'm seein'
Be out in my satellite capturin' sight that your eyes couldn't fathom
Fillin' up the still cane and spreadin' over your terrain
Changin' complexions, intersection, that you holdin' down
It goes around like bad karma with mass trauma, the 1200
Yo, who want it? Cause I'm much obliged to give it
With centrifugal forces, sources beyond your physics
My mic chemistry, convincingly providin' what's efficiently fly
Straight to your chest, comin' off o' my mouth
You know your armor no match for me. Understandably so

Yo
Who wanna test the levels of their versify?
Spinnin' the earth and search beneath it where the purpose lies
Ready to dance under the pale moonlight
You'll soon find what you're dealin' with significantly certified
Who wanna test Mr. "Three-I-Versify"?
Your whole notions in this thing have been commercialized
Ready to dance under the pale moonlight
You'll soon find
Yo, certified
