Let's take a little time, we can head up north
Walk the tracks again
Step aside for the trains, and put some coins down
Get to talkin'
It's the same old place, the thoughts all change
With the scenery
We can clear our heads, or converse instead
On the times changing

Walk with me
Eh-eh! Eh-eh!

Walk with me
Eh-eh! Eh-eh!

Let's take a little time, we can head out east
And drive the little roads
Flea market weekend, watchin' people
See how the hagglin' goes
Might pay a princely sum, if it's alright
And it's on my dime
Or we can chat away, in the parking lot
Either one is fine

Walk with me
Eh-eh! Eh-eh!

Walk with me
Eh-eh! Eh-eh!

Hoo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo

Walk with me, and we can speak of things
And all those things, that people just don't see

Walk with me, and we can see those things
That came to pass, were never meant to be

Walk with me
Eh-eh! Eh-eh!

Walk with me
Eh-eh!
