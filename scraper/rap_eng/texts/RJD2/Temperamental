[Verse]
I made my bed and tried to sleep
And still my eyes are opened wide
Inside my head can't find my peace
And all this hurt I just can't hide

Maybe I'm a victim of my own defenses
And maybe I don't care about the consequences

[Hook]
I'm on fire, baby
But so temperamental
I burn it all down
Burn it all down

[Verse 2]
This violent heart inside of me
It twists and turns and takes me low
I played my part so silently
And now I find I lost control
Cause I should've known
That telling you the truth would be forbidden
And I was a fool to ever think
That all would be forgiven
And if I could have a better day
Well, I'd just inhale, I'm living
But oh, no, it's not enough for you
So you can run and paint this town
With the color of your lies
And I'll keep sharpening myself
Bleed you slow until you die
Oh, why do we lie to ourselves
Saying it's all in the name of love
When my indifference knows no bounds
And I have had enough

Maybe I'm a victim of my own defenses
And maybe I don't care about the consequences

[Hook]

Maybe I'm a victim of my own defenses
And maybe I don't care about the consequences

I'm on fire, baby
But so temperamental
I burn it all down
I burn it all down
I burn it all down, yeah
I burn it all down
I burn it all down
Burn it all down
