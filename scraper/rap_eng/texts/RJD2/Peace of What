(Peace)
You don't want it
You can want it, naw
(Peace)
You don't mean it
You can't mean it, naw
(Peace)
We can't have it
(Peace)
But the world willed the shots
And the tears come like clockwork
(Peace)
We built a world where the pain
And the fears run like water
(Peace)

Does freedom comfort you at night
While you read the news by candlelight
Rounds and rounds, will load another
In the land of duck and cover, oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

(Peace)
We don't believe you
Can't believe you, no
(Peace)
You can't mean that
You don't mean that, no
(Peace)
You can't want that
You don't want that
And the tears come like clockwork
(Peace)
And the fears run like water
(Peace)
The more fortunate are watching on
(Peace)
While the mourners are marching on
(Peace)

The sea of graves are monument
To full and total armament
Ease the fears of your good mother
Teach the young to duck and cover
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
