[Intro: Copywrite]
Hailing from the city of Columbus in the mental state of the Megahertz Crew
This is Copywrite MC 78 degrees with my man Camu Tao
DJ Faze on the wheels

[Verse One: Copywrite]
We don't need gimmicks
Wack ones still ride the dilz till they exceed the speed limits
When it's time to rhyme, MCs feed the mimic
But by the time they repeat what I flipped
I'll be on some old next thesis
Keep the change I release
We're getting brains speaking through wide range
Frequency mics, freaking the strange
Keeping the leakin' weak MC eagerly wait--
--ting patiently
Before they spoke, their forte broke
Plain I don't make, donate my brain to science if I ever do
This residue's examined by every crew
From Syracuse to Sacramento
You heard me
I make the King of the players wear a New Jersey
And start from scratch
Since my verse strikes herbs
The first mic clutched by me is an artifact
Clutchin' my rap is hard to do
I call your crew weak
Cause it takes seven days for them to stay on beat
And when they finally get on their rhyme will be
Simultaneously spit on/struck by the two-man queue, man
Head on truck: you're stuck
Who can withstand this man's skill
Luck is what you battled with
And got dumped in a landfill
Stand still, there drops the anvil
Each round proves you have no props or mad skill

[Instrumental break, background chatter]

[Verse Two: Camu Tao]
Handle the jewels with care when you're ridin'
My aggressiveness is on another plane
Like the [godwin/god wind?] off
Stayed off and [caught? then cough and/tin coffin?]
And that's a form of writer's block
Biters jock
The rhyme stages
My phrases are like mazes
Lock the mind, capture
Snap your reality like the rapture
Oh God! You've [cleareded??] the obscure organ
Nurse! Give me the needle
Deliver the feeble elixir
[Quick'll the stick'lls???] body rejects the unwanted; some wanted
I'm doing life for [my mind, all in the rhyme??]
Baby, I got hostages
Period. Like an out-of-body experience
When I enter the [host is hostile/my style??] when I'm rockin' it
The Mar-velle
That escapes the style like cakes from Carvel
And those rhymes you're kickin' ain't even phat to me
In fact, [we'll be the phantasm for the vic to flip??]
[To flay like they pull they fat??]
[To re-ah-act so shortly-ly eyes, I drop the vibe??]
Another brother's mic has stopped the frequency
See?
With the mic device I slice another brother's [vic-a-ry??]
Contort the most masculine MC's masculinity
[So why the tay more fix of anger??]
And it's so strange [??]
As I begin to bend your materials
Shock your stimuli, strain, strip your memory bane
Inflicted the anti-inferior MC exterior
Word to Jehovah
With a [stiff's mismatch??]
This rapper dispatch flows that catch cat's tongues
[Tons and eternals??]
Eternally MC amazing
[The seven of rhyme and they target??]
Occasion [??] Say when
Then I engage in activation

[Instrumental break; background chatter]
