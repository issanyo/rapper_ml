[Intro]
Niece: Hey uncle, whatchu doin'?
Blueprint: Aw, just, uh, writin', just writin' down my thoughts
Little song I'm trying to finish up
N: Yeah? What's it about?
B: Well, it's kind of about, you know, girls and they grow up
And how they be feelin' pressure to do stuff
And... boys, and... just advice I have to give you some day
N: Can I hear it?

[Verse One]
I know it might seem like the cool thing to do
But having sex with him ain't the best thing for you
You worry too much about what they think of you
Girl don't define you by what they think is cool
You wanna be with him cause he is the hottest thing in school
He got the newest gear, and he got the cleanest shoes
But take my advice girl: Don't be a fool
Before you get involved with him you gotta have rules
Rule number 1
Make him call you first
Then ask him if he goes to church
Not the church alone makes you better than anyone
But if he is only out for sex he'll definitely run
Rule number 2 might seem kinda wrong
But tell him you got older brothers even if you don't
Tell him they're thug'd out and always around
Let him know your last man got a beat down
And when he asks you, "Will they do that to me?"
You say, "Only if you raise your hand and never hit me."
Rule number 3: Even if you don't practice it
Tell him you are a virgin and you're all about abstinence
You ain't having sex cause your parents ain't having it
Your moms is real strict and your dad will have a fit
And if you say that and he stays on the line
Keep him around for a while
He might be worth your time

[Niece & Blueprint talking]
N: That's really good uncle
B: Thank you, thank you.. You know I..
Tryin' make you sure you know what you need to know cause..
It's gon' come the time that you gon' need that advice..
I mean, you're only 8 right now but.. Tryin' to look out
N: Did you write some more?
B: Yeah.. I gotta, i gotta a second verse I can let you check out
You know, along the same lines
N: I wanna hear it
B: Okay

I know it might seem like the cool thing to do
But having a baby now ain't the best thing for you
You worry too much about what they think of you
Girl don't define you by what they think is cool
You are a teenager
But want a bundle of joy
Somebody you can teach and hold, a girl or a boy
But you got a life in your hands
That ain't a toy
How you gonna pay the bills when your not even employed?
I know you think I'm hating just to call you out
But you don't need a kid
You need a paper route
Have you even thought about what "being mom" is all about?
Mom got a real job, mom don't go out
Mom gotta drop the kid off at day care
And when the kids is sick, mom gotta stay there
I know it probably seems like it really ain't fair
But she gotta work twice as hard cause pops ain't there
Now you can go to sleep if you're feeling tired
But soon you won't get to sleep if the baby's cryin'
You gotta fix a warm bottle plus change the diapers
Forget about the single moms you used to admire
Your childhood is gone and you can barely remember that
The innocence you had, nobody can bring it back
Now your whole life is dirty diapers and Similac
I hope you reconsider when you hear the facts
