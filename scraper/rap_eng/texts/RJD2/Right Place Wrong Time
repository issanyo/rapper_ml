[Refrain]
Right Place Wrong Time, Inside Outside
Young woman with an old mind
Right Place Wrong Time, just can't understand
Innocent man with big plans
Right Place Wrong Time, Inside Outside
Young woman with an old mind
Right Place Wrong Time, just can't understand
Innocent man with big plans

[Verse 1]
I remember when you held my heart like a child
Rested in the comfort of your smile
Life was an instant, love was an infant
But now everything is distant
You lived ten minutes away from me
But every telephone call feels like long distance
You say that you're being straight with me
But every question that I ask you is met with resistance
It's hard for me to mind my business
It's even harder for me to not be suspicious
Why you try'na hide where you been
Telling me you been out kicking it with your friends
But I can tell something ain't right
I stayed up and waited for your ass all night
You walked in the door before daylight
Make up messed up, smelling like fahrenheit
I don't know how I put up with it this long
But don't worry, I'm gone
And when you wondering where I went
Don't worry, I'm gone
