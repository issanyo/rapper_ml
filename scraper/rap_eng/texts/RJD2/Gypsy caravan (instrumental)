Paroles de la chanson Gypsy Caravan(Instrumental) :
Downtown on a thirteen train
A free ride hangin' off the frame
These people been waiting years and years
They been up drinkin' beers and beers
I came along for the sights to see
They came down for the victory
A molotov cocktail ready to jam
We came in like a gypsy caravan!

Run for the hills hide your gold
They got sticks that'll break your bones
Tippin' cars like dominoes
No stoppin' when they're in the throes
Lootin' places in the old city
It's like the moment's on LSD
God came down to kick the can
And all he saw was a gypsy caravan!

No regard for tomorrow's comeback
Leavin' nothin' in town intact
World champs for a long time comin'
Too bad somebody's gonna get done in
People swear they believe in this place
Always threaten to leave but then stay
Can't treat it like their own homeland
They run through like a gypsy caravan
