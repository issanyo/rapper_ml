Hook:
(Where I’m at?) I’m there when the alley calls (Steadily calling me)
I’m right here, come on/ (Hoo)
Where I’m at? (I’m there when the alley calls)
Steadily calling me (I’m right here come on)
Human highlight film (AHHOOH)
I’m there when the alley calls/ (2x)

[RiGoletto Rockwell Verse 1]:
Middle of the cipher you find me there/
Bars riddle w flair/
Other bars sparkle, right til you hit em with air/..
Too many rappers today/
Most of the time most, don’t have shit to say/..
My motto never give abrazo to the fake ones/
Keep my eyes open, waiting for the moment/
& just that quick the moment passed/
Mr. flatulence I’m laughing at you since there’s no reason for you to be gassed/
I’m, standing on the corner to avoid the abysm/..
Spitting on those championing atheism/
Ya knowledge means shit/
You’ll never get anywhere trick/
Smart but a known fool…
I’m from the old school/

Hook:
(Where I’m at?) I’m there when the alley calls (Steadily calling me)

[RiGoletto Rockwell Verse 2:]
Welcome to the abbatoir/
I offer ménage after the alcohol/
If that ain’t enough I got division provisions/
Here comes fame for anybody that’ll listen/
Body parts were written/
Crocodiles risen for anybody, who wants to leapfrog the system/
They told me to catch up/
I’m on the heels of Achilles/
Nobody wants to feel me/
Save for the fact when my rhymes enact filthy/
Thought, it’s the old adage/
Too bad many of you could never manage/
I’m not the next Rakim, I’m better than him/
Anybody that you name, I’m better than them/

Hook:
(Where I’m at?) I’m there when the alley calls (Steadily calling me)
I’m right here, come on/ (Hoo)

[RiGoletto Rockwell Verse 3:]
My bars are better than yours don’t believe me I’m in the dictionary right next to R.A.W./
No millennium can kill me either/
I won’t resign/
I’m picking bars that equate to liters/
Pissing on wars & a dead leader/..
Horny kid in class, wanting the head teacher/
No Columbine for mine broke w a left Nina/
Trench coat pro/
Couldn’t trace the speed I broke through the Velcro/
Yea, yea ya’ll know/…
