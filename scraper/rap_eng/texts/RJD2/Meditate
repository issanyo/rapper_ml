Meditate like a type of medication
Patience is latent elation
Makeshift, delayed in sedation
One way we all stay awakened

Meditate like a type of medication
Time's wasted chasing the franklins
Live stations played to a nation
Distilled but still need filtration

Meditate it could be your medication
Timeless is violence in ages
Priceless; the lives those endangered
Strangers; the mind state today is

Meditate it could be your medication
Migration silenced and flagrant
Someday we’ll find a safe haven
Danger your maker says time is up

Your time is up
Don’t try to run young gun
Your time is up
Now the one last thing to ask is

If I stumble
Begin to tumble
Hear my humble
Plea to y’all
Dear world
Please, don’t break my fall

No, not at all
They don’t hear my call
Promise me you won’t
Don’t break my fall

And if I stumble
Only if I’m humble
Knee deep, and under
Don’t break my fall

In the name of the One
The most gracious of them
The who speaks no tongue
Seeks none and sees all
Raise us all
Kin, kids, women, and men
So that our feet may reach to you
And may we ascend
Into the highest levels in heaven

Free us from the evil in this world and into the next
Extinguish these burning desires
And leave us blessed
Free us from the fire of this hell on earth
Multiplied by images of fine life
Forgive me for my worst

Please don’t mind my blind sight at times
And take my faith for all it is
Aid me in all my ways
On both my great and mundane days
Forgive my wrongs dealings
Any type of wrong feelings
Take them all away

I think of you every time
I swear I think of you every time I...
Meditate

Meditate like a type of medication
Patience is latent elation
Makeshift, delayed in sedation
One way we all stay awakened

Meditate it could be your medication
Mindless, a high; no relation
Silence in life, less sensation
Danger, your maker says time is up

Your time is up
Don’t try to run young gun
Your time is up
Now the one last thing to ask is

If I stumble
Begin to tumble
Hear my humble
Plea to y’all
Dear world
Please, don’t break my fall

No, not at all
They don’t hear my call
Promise me you won’t
Don’t break my fall

And if I stumble
Only if I’m humble
Knee deep and under
Don’t break my fall
