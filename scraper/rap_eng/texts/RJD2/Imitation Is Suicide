[Verse 1]
You asked for it
You asked for it
Never could hold your tongue
You ain't innocent

Grab a little moment
Now you got it all
Standing on the top
Of a world that’s about to fall

When that self-made crown
Defaced and fought
Calling out blames
Yeah, you know your name

[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Imitation's suicide
Hey, check yourself please
'Cause imitation’s suicide
Yeah, you know you are

[Verse 2]
So you're on your ride
Yeah, you're flying high
Firing on those sides
You think, "take so he doesn't die"

You can't report it
You were a stone
Your love was taken
Now, you're alone

It's so hard solo
S-O-L-O (but could that make you)
Solo
S-O-L-O-W

[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Imitation's suicide
Hey, check yourself please
’Cause imitation’s suicide
Yeah, you know you are
Yeah

[Bridge]
Never ceases to amaze me
Never ceases to amaze me
Never ceases to amaze me
Never ceases to amaze me

Never ceases to amaze me
Never ceases to amaze me
Never ceases to amaze me
Never ceases to amaze me

[Outro]
Imitation's suicide
And while you’re sleeping
I'm making songs for flight
