[Intro]
Look at you now, in the air, off the ground
Don't look down, eyes ahead, up in the clouds
Look at you now, in the air, off the ground
Don't look down, eyes ahead, up in the clouds
Up in the clouds...

[Verse: Blueprint]
The bright lights and the sun's glare
Feel like he hadn't seen it in a whole year
Looked to his right and saw a wheelchair
But he had no idea what it was doing there
Sluggish and drugged from god knows what
With machines and colostomy bags up to his gut
Body so stiff he want to stand
But he realized that he couldn't feel his legs
Looked to his right and saw his mom's there
She smiled back, shed a tear
Reached out, then held his hand
He saw her do it but he couldn't feel a thing
Physically numb, but he felt fear
Funny how this one time tough guy was now scared
The doctor calmly made him aware
That he'd been in a coma for a whole year
Car accident on New Year's
He was designated driver for a few friends
Who needed a ride after a few beers
But he hadn't had a drink in a few years
They was almost home when he got clipped
Spun out of control then the car flipped
Now all he could do was sob with his mom
Said the other kid with him came home fine
Been about three years since that event
Been picking up the pieces ever since
Nobody expects him to walk again
Ride a bike, stand, or play ball again
But he about to show them what's up
Went from a wheelchair to a walker in nine months
To a walker to learning how to stand up
And today he takes his first steps

First steps

First steps

[Hook]
Look at you now, in the air, off the ground
Don't look down, eyes ahead, up in the clouds
Look at you now, in the air, off the ground
Don't look down, eyes ahead, up in the clouds
Up in the clouds...
