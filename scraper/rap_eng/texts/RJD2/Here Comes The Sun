Don't be surprised when I rise
No, No
Don’t be surprised when I rise
No, No

Don’t be surprised
When you look up in the sky
And see me shine

You won't believe your eyes
You’ll see the light
The skies will be so bright
Tomorrow when I rise

Don’t be surprised
Don’t be surprised

Can’t wait
Tomorrow when I rise

Don’t close your eyes
Don’t close your eyes

I can’t wait to save the day
And kill the night

So, don’t be surprised when it's time
Yuh, don’t let the dark outshine the light

Don’t you deny
When you look up in the sky
And see me shine

You won't believe your eyes
The skies will be so bright
When I rise

I see your world keeps spinning round
I hope you never have to bow to a crown
Never follow the crowd
They tip toeing outta bounds
So loud, tell ‘em, “bring the horns out”
They plead for forgiveness
While on their last breath
They leave you in an instant
Lay em down to rest
Some never cared to seek paradise
Cause it was too far and distant
Never heard the truth
Some refused to even listen
I hope you heard there’s a curse
Out there on the earth
If I recall it walks
Along with all the worthless
It’s something they've been praying to purchase
Following the profit
Drawing the merchant
I’ve seen it distribute itself from person to person
It was hidden in the script
Of many pertinent verses
I set upon the east side
Lighting up the west coast
This little light of mine
Spread it out let it show
Hope it always keeps a shine
Let them all know
That no one can do it better when I rise

They’ll all be singing
Here comes the sun

To brighten up your days
Here comes the sun

And the skies will be so bright
When I rise
