Everything you are to me
Makes me think that you could be
The end to all my

Everything you touch turns right
Underneath your very eyes

Everybody's life rolls by
Like a melancholy song
Can you see me differently?
I believe that you see me

Everything you are to me
Makes me think that you could be
The end to all my

Everything you touch turns right
Underneath your very eyes
