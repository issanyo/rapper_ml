It's nice to hear you say "hello."
And how are things with you, I love you
But very soon it's time to go
An office job to do, I'm up here writing songs for you

It's nice hear your voice again
I've waited all day long, even wrote a song for you
It's strange the way you make me feel, with just a word or two
I'd like to do the same for you

[Chorus]
Strange how a phonecall can change your day, take you away
Away from the feeling of being alone, pass the telephone

It's nice to hear you say "hello."
And how are things with you, I love you
But very soon it's time to go
An office job to do, I'm up here writing songs for you

It's nice hear your voice again
I've waited all day long, even wrote a song for you
It's strange the way you make me feel with just a word or two
I'd like to do the same for you

[Chorus]
