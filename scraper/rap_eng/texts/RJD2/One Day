I know I said it
Many times before
I've always said that some day I'd leave
And never come back no more

Maybe one day
I have the strength to leave
I know you told all your friends
What a fool, he'll always be

But as soon as I try
Something takes a hold of me inside
Yes, it does
Oh baby!

(Gamble)

I'm not trying to threaten you baby
That's not something I would do
But maybe the thought of losing me
Should show you I'm your fool

Maybe one day
I have the strength to leave
I know you told all your friends
What a fool, he'll always be

But as soon as I try
Something takes a hold of me inside
Yes, it does
Oh baby!

(Gamble)

I've been a fool!
