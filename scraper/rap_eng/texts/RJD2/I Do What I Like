[Hook]
I do what I like
I do what I love
I do what I like
Get drunk all day, get high all night
Chase girls around and everything's all right cause
I do what I like
I do what I love
I do what I like
Get drunk all day, get high all night
You stressing yourself out, be more like Dice

[Verse One]
I'm just a piece of shit
A slimeball
A jerkoff
Teachers used to say, "Boy, wipe that smirk off
Learn your lesson writing raps and you'll be worse off."
But then
Never was the type of guy
To get along with the star of the team
And I can say "Rappers...cha out ya mind"
If ya think that yo' as raw as me
Because
I'm 'bout as raw as they come
And they don't come much rawer than this
And I'm the boy, I never give a chickenhead shit
Cause I'm a hustler
A mack daddy, straight fucking pimp
Then
Just a sucker for love
You know, deep down inside just a sucker for love
[?] the world's most incredible thug
But the reality, I'm trembling in front of a judge
But then...

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Real slimy
Well, maybe just a little two timey
I cheated on all of my girlfriends
And at the end of the day, I ain't got a good reason besides...
I do what I like
Don't pull your hair out, do it like Dice
Man, fuck Nike
Fuck Mike
[?]
I roll one up
See a bad bitch man, stroll on up
Ha ma
I'd really like to date ya
Knowing down inside I'd like to rape ya
Because
I'm really perverted
In South Africa you know kids get murdered
And if
That's my game, that's what I spit to the dame
They like the idea of dealing with a guy with a brain
But then
I'm sorta insane
But don't [?] that's just how I do my thang
Ayo all gather round
You all gather round
Everybody rides free on the train uptown
Cause

[Hook]
I do what I like
I do what I love
I do what I like
Get drunk all day, get high all night
Chase girls around and everything's all right cause
I do what I like
I do what I love
I do what I like
Get drunk all day, get high all night
And if you're stressing yourself out be more like Dice
