[Verse 1: Cool Calm Pete]
Run this circle around circumstance
Circumvent the globe
Hit the road jack
Not white or black
Lost in the grey matter as a matter of fact
You in that area? but there's no time to react

Ya still against the grain trying to maintain
All the other cliches that come with this rap game
Now its a trap, holla if the storm sorta take you back
Golden age of rap, watch out below

Look at him go, Derwin
And microphone Merlin
Modern day renaissance, man, watch the whirlwind
Back spinning all, out of control
Lo and behold, these old feelings just steady your soul
Some knowledge is see through, scooping out the clear view
Dangling of the rear view, ain't nobody can read you
Even mom dukes says just live a little
But simple things in life are embedded in the riddle

[Hook]
What can you do, you can't turn back the clock?
That's why you keep on moving and you don't, stop (x4)

[Verse 2: Jaymanila]
Some say, dollars is freedom-- of the money is a hard break
Love conquers all except divorce, loss and heartache
Children are cruel
Chilling is cool
Finish the school
The minute you want solid ground, it flips and you pity this fool
To the people of the inner city keep breaking the rules
Only to change the system thats given ya'll the limited tools
You humans are impressive ain't no magical bills
The government shouts "theirs no money!", sitting on capital hill
So i punched a drunken of their cases, like goodness is a merit
If you'll born evil I was guard of the torrent standing
On the caroline staring at her pretty head
Don't mind me miss I'm just fishing for a common thread
Life there is a laughable and chase them to the cosmos
Marks with all beats
Don't beat
Rocks the bongos
This goes, all to claim they figured it out
For when this record jigga jiggaz that triggers the doubt

[Hook]
What can you do, you can't turn back the clock?
That's why you keep on moving and you don't, stop (x3)
What can you do, when you can't turn back the clock?

[Verse 3: cool calm Pete]
And yo, these new York citizens walk at erratic speeds
The mic booms denizen bringin' you what you need'
That is some no name wasteland in the confounds of brooklyn'
Babblin' townsfolk got jokes for ya humans
All are ready, rock confetti, winner of the life now
I sound redundant maybe i outta pipe down
Buzz killed thru repetition at random
So abruptly im focused
I lost sight of my tantrum

Come on baby, ain't nothing so cut n' dry
Mid 90's still -doing that butterfly-
Can the petty pride you're all city wide
Calm beat, the l train city guide
Your dope beats are like lyrical bail money
Out the brain cell block, now I'm outta parole
But slow your roll cuz you got no place to go
So tell a friend that the world is round

365 another year dies down (x3)

[Verse 4: Jaymanila]
Yo, in the sport of kings
Better than them diamond rings
Who brought more shit then this mother effin rhymin' brings
I see them damn man doin music
"how we use it?'
Like congrats shit was fresh, but you like sike you abuse it!
Choose to let it lie hunt for north just to dedit
Disperse to all castles to all fools like i can't wed it
Doctors orders, you can't quarantine him to his quarters
Cause he's always going be doing what he aut not orda
Plus the sense is gone, we trust only trust more than ya'll
Worship my 50 dollar bills on all suites of fail and gone
If you need i'll be at the school and i'll be under the wall
Contemplating on my name, what the hell went wrong?
Im in a state of zen, they actions make me xenophobic
When was the last time you shot a man or is that question still loaded?
Im the, father of angsta rap, absentee
Just call me uneasy e, you feeling nervous, and there i'll be
Please dont mess my words up we jux and dis in franchise
Weary servant suckers with the option for or five
To the peace stick receiver, complete pacifist to the face, peace
A none believer in his procedures
Dont be fooled by what proceeded ya
Needless to notify, ya'll teammates of mine on this club called human kind
