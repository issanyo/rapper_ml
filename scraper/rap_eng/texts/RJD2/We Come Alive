I know your face
Know you're always up the road
It never comes
No-one to hear you anyway
You know my face
Think i stay up north of here
We never need
Why would we talk if there's no need
Comatose nine to five
But then we come alive
Split off and catch a ride
Three strangers side by side

[Chorus]
You
Just living life
There's only rock and roll
Besides
They'll stoop so low just to get so high

Diamonds flashing all in my eyes x2

Faces lit up from this grow?
In sync with most of the throne?
We never speak of its pain
Not for you, me, or anyone
We all escape somehow
The mundane an' day to day
Simple dance- it's on
That's just you to give me a moment today
Comatose nine to five
Just to feel death comin' right
From uptown train arrives
Three strangers side by side

[Chorus]

Diamonds flashing all in my eyes x2

Finally once the smoke has cleared
So blind
We'll have to shine a light
Heaven 's close to here
I can feel it in my bones
Been searching for so long
To find it right
In between my ears

Ohhhh...

[guitar solo]

[Chorus]

Diamonds flashing all in my eyes x5
