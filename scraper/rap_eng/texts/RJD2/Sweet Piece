Paroles de la chanson Sweet Piece :
It's too easy
It's just too easy
You made it easy
Just too damn easy
Just believe it
No resistance
No longer needed
Sorry you missed us
Please understand it
We just can't have it in the family

Sweet piece
I knew her cousin
She'd been over and over and over and over

Sweet piece
Who knew she wasn't

She'd been over and over and over and over

Little princess
With memories gone bad
You should ask her
About the dates she's had
Mr. Legend, Dr. Civic, and Mr. Lexus

Don't think I'm bothered
But you ???
I'm not your father
Forgot it's not me
So call up Maurice
Let 'm know you've got a story to te
