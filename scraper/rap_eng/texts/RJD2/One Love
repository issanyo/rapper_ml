[Blueprint takling]
Yes, Soul Position
This is Blueprint, live from, the O-State
On the tracks we got, RJD2, of the Megahertz
Yo, I'd like to call this one love
Let's see some hands wavin', from side to side, you know?
Peace signs in the air on this one
It's all about love, not hate y'all
Let me know if you wit' me
Wave 'em side to side, two fingers up, to the sky you know?

[Blueprint]
It goes stop, look, listen to your heart
Stop look listen to the children
The answer's been with us from the start
The look in their eyes let's me know god's willin'
I'm a simple man, I don't have all the answers
But I know it starts in the hearts of men
And I don't think it's too much to ask for
If you can't do it for you, do it for them
So you don't wanna' be a role model
But like it or not, you're still makin' music for them
You just might be the one they follow
So think about bein' a little more truthful to them
I promised that I'd never be ashamed of my rhymes
And I'd leave behind something that's useful to them
Years ago I made up my mind
And said, I'd never make life more confusing to them
What about you, you think it's to late?
There's no better time than right now for you to begin
But first you gotta' let go of the hate
Put your guns down
You wanna' fight?
Then do it with pens
Hold you head up and stand tall
Even when you lose in the end
What matters most is you gave your all
So you can never in you life look stupid to them
The experiance you gained should be admired
Not just whether you lose or win
Cause even gold must go through fire
Only to become brand new in the end
I realize I can't change the world
No matter how much I try
But hopefully I can start with you
One line at a time
One rhyme at a time

[Hook]
Yo, all my people in the strugle (wit' me)
One love
Time is so limited
One life
I'm out doin' it all (y'all)
One chance
Tryin' to see the world but I'm just
One man
(x4)
