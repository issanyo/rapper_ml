[Intro]
Alright now
Be my one two
Uh and it go

[Hook]
All rough and rugged when you dressing for mass
And my attitude is fuck it cause motherfuckers love it
Fuck It!
Cause motherfuckers love it x2
I got a - chip on my shoulder the size of a golden nuggets in Vegas
And fuck being famous
I came to get the buzz
I came to get the buzz
I came to get the buzz

Hold on, here it go x8

[Verse 1]
Never had a lot and still we made it work man
Now we on the road like dollar cabs and church vans
Write about experiences from the first-hand
To judge a book by appearance might be the worst plan
My mama raised me well therefore I'm a blessed man
My mama told me give them hell
Don't be a yes man
Yes ma'am - that I do
I got 'em shook like big-foots and Rougarous
I get them outie like goodbyes and tootaloos
I'm from Atlanta like chick-fil-a's and hootie-hoos
Hell, I was brought up on booty shake and soul food
And I was taught to let bass quake in old schools
My grandma got a rib shack on Auburn Ave
If you ever in Atlanta you should grip a slab
I spent my summers doing dishes and my uncle asked:
"You working hard or you working smart" then he would laugh
Cause he knew that lunch brunch was busting my ass
Said it's more important do it right than do it fast
Take six months to build a Rolls Royce
Thirteen hours to build a Toyota
Do the math
I did the dishes already, but y'all can get a glass
And toast to the moment and hope this time will last
But there's a threat that - that there'll be set backs
I'm trying to make it in America, respect that
That I too sing America Langston Hughes that
I'm from the South where the bible belts and blues at
Out in Atlantic City where the house of blues at
If life is a gamble this where you lose at
Hold on to these words nigga don't lose that
You feel that fire in your gut - you got to use that
Don't just be sitting on your butt - you got to move that
They said I'm the one, I got to prove that
(And it go)

[Hook]
All rough and rugged when you dressing for mass
And my attitude is fuck it cause motherfuckers love it
Fuck It!
Cause motherfuckers love it x2
I got a - chip on my shoulder the size of a golden nuggets in Vegas
And fuck being famous
I came to get the buzz
I came to get the buzz
I came to get the buzz

Hold on, here it go x8

[Verse 2]
Who's the greatest
Ain't no greatest
Ain't no gods here
Ain't no Poseidon or Zeus or Hades - we all clear
Roll with the titans be enlightened
We ain't fighting fair
When in Rome, do as the Romans do (ah yeah)
If this go over your head, you ain't on my level right
And if I go to deep you got your shovel right
I write with a passion it's like my call to action
At an open mic, I'm like Jesse Jackson
Spit like Brother Malcolm ballot or the bullet speech
Tough as Martin Luther King that have a dream
And address it from the Lincoln Memorial
The revolution won't be televised because the ratings would be horrible
Hmm - I'm like Gil Scott Heron wearing the latest fashion
At a stage in my life where trendy ain't in fashion
It so happens that classics never get old
Trends fade but classes never get told
Hit the road Jack
Twenty years or so they mosey back
Just like Kwame's polka dots
You notice that
But I want to be remembered just like every December
When you hear them same Christmas carols
Uh, Valentine Saint Cupid arrows
Hit you in the heart and you start to reminisce like uh
C.L. Smooth on Pete Rock shit
This that 54-11 Reebok shit for the ladies
Suede Pumas on my feet made it feel like the 80's
Back when [four and a baby]
Hit the project lobby
And the bridge - the b-b-bridge bumpin' them oddies
I was only a pup
I did not give a fuck
I never knew I would touch
Somebody saw when I clutched a microphone
Thanks for holding on
Had this chip on my shoulder I'd been holding so long
Like the Farnese sculpture of Atlas so when in Rome (I tell 'em)

[Outro]
Hold on, here it go x8
