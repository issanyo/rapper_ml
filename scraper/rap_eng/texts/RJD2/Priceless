Try that again (yeah yeah yeah)
Turn my headphone joints up, yeah yeah
It's them dudes, Soul Position
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, what

I got a '92 MPV, my radiator leaks
But at least it's mine
You got a brand new Range Rover but it's rented
So you gotta have it back Monday morning at 9
Prol'ly never catch me tryna floss or shine
If you see me out then I'm on the grind
Get from point A to B, enjoy the ride
I'm drivin this cause it's all I could afford to buy
Is that supposed to be platinum?
C'mon dawg, don't play with me, that can't be real
I know what you told me you paid for
But what they gave you, is really stainless steel
I guess this means I'm a playa hater
Cause I think it's the fakest chain I've ever seen
As long as you know (yeah) that if you keep wearin that
Around your neck, it'll prol'ly turn green

[Hook]
Jesus piece with the chain (too much)
Pimped out ride on them thangs (too much)
Feelin good about who you really are (priceless)
Knowin you can be yourself and be a star (priceless)
Security to watch yo' back (too much)
All them guns that you pack (too much)
Feelin good about who you really are (that's priceless)
Knowin you can be yourself and be a star (that's priceless)

Girls, don't try to run and hide
Don't think for a second I forgot about y'all
Why y'all always talkin 'bout "Let me get YOUR number"
Knowin damn well that you ain't about to call?
When I couldn't get your number girl I knew what was up
But you still tried to play me out and act all slick
That's why I didn't even bother writin down my number
On that piece of paper, I just wrote down BITCH!
Slow your roll bro, you ain't a mack
You just over-confident cause you had a couple beers
Knowin you've been livin with the same fat girl
Since high school, for the last eight years
Oh, she let you go out now?
Last I heard she had you on lockdown
And if it ain't true, why she keep tellin me
That you ain't home every time that I call your house?
You know you gotta get permission two weeks before
The actual date you wanna go out the door
And if you get outta pocket and don't let her know
She'll just look you in the face and say ("Hell no!")

[Hook]
Lyin to your girl and gettin busted (too much)
Sayin you was really mackin when you wasn't (too much)
Feelin good about who you really are (priceless)
Knowin you can be yourself and be a star (priceless)
Gettin dudes to buy you all them drinks (too much)
Actin too stuck up to speak (too much)
Feelin good about who you really are (that's priceless)
Knowin you can be yourself and be a star (that's priceless)
