You are gone
I'm so all alone
Here's what's left of my happy home
"She'll be back"
That's what i said
As i stare at the ceiling
'Cause i need you baby
Oh, how i miss you baby
'Cause i need you baby
Oh, how i miss you baby. [baby,baby,baby,baby,baby] {fade out}
'Cause i need you baby
Oh, how i miss you baby
'Cause i need you baby
Oh, how i miss you baby
You are gone
I'm so all alone
Here's what's left of my happy home
"She'll be back"
That's what i said
As i stare at the ceiling
'Cause i need you baby
Oh, how i miss you baby
'Cause i need you baby
Oh, how i miss you baby. [baby,baby,baby,baby,baby] {fade out}
