420
420
420 (Hey!)
4...
Every day, every day
It's 420

[Verse 1]
Uh, I got 'er open smokin' loud packs
She think that all men are dog, but I had to howl at ya'
Anyway..
So anyway
I broke the hash down and
She broke her past down and
We sip the brown, don't fight the feeling, this ain't the last round
I twist the bone and lit that chome and I love that sound
When blue flames of butane, slightly change to or-range
And that thang starts to cherry at the tip
Ooh shit!
Get yo' hit
This remind me back in school, when I used to cop a nick
Rock the 'fro, eyes low in all of my yearbook pics
And now I know that you don't do this on a regular tip
But put that joint on your lips, this ain't no regular day
The calendar say 4/20, that's reason to celebrate
How you feel? Feelin' good, Feelin' great
How you feel? Feelin' good, yes it do
Let it move through your soul, let the herbs take control
Of your mind and your body, while we kick it like karate
GET HIYAH!

[Verse 2]
I feel like 4/20 should have a mascot
Don't think the Easter Bunny deserves that whole April slot
Cause rabbits don't lay no eggs, therefore that's all a crock
Just put that fable to bed, get ready to roll some pot
And touch the sky if you can, ladies get high with yo' man
Fella's get down with yo' chick, and if she can't roll no spliff
Teach that bitch
Show her how it's done, just for fun, roll another one up
Mmm! This shit right here, last year won in the Cannabis Cup
Yup
I think this US Sativa, that's that Ghost Train I believe
It got me stuck, then it struck
The clock struck 4:20, that's reason to celebrate
How you feel? Feelin' good, Feelin' great
How you feel? Feelin' good, yes it do
Let it move through your soul, let the herbs take control
Of your mind and your body, while we kick it like karate
GET HIYAH!
