One big voice
Slowly emerge
No escape
To the woes I word
Peace and calm
No more exist
For bedlam
Has it come to this?
Sometimes you need to know its your time to rock
Sometimes you need to know its your time to run
Sometimes you need to know its your time to rock
Sometimes you need to know its your time to run
For Bedlam
Has it come to this?
