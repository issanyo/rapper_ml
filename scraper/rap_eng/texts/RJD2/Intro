[Blueprint talking]
You know what it is
You know who this is, but I'mma say my name anyway
They call me Blueprint
You know my steez
Printmatic
On the tracks we got, RJD2
You know, holdin' it down
This is Soul Position
Probly knew that already though
Yo, now last year, a lot of people been comin' up to me like

"Homie, workin' on that," was my reply
Took my time with it though
Ain't about to put no garbage out
Feel me?
