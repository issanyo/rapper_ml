Just inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale
Just inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale,...exhale
Just inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale
Just inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale,...exhale

My rhymin' get invited in your body like a vitamin
I supply the suppliment
You just discovered it
Hold me close and overdose on my poetic potion
Love me when you rub me in your skin like lotion
Then I'll begin to stimulate your inovative action
You used to be subdued
But now you choose to rhyme with passion
Sign for this delivery that I left on your portch
Sign for this delivery no matter what the cost
Let my thought direct you when you start feelin' lost
Tune into my frequency and never turn me off
Listen to my interview straight from the source
Order from my menu and get the main course
Come on into work early
Let me be your boss
Let me be the theme music
You won't take a loss

Just inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale
Just inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale,...exhale
Just inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale
Just inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale,...exhale

You don't need a needle just to put me in your arm
Let me fill your blood stream until you're feelin' warm
Let me do the fightin' for you 'til the pain's gone
Store me in a safe place deep inside your home
I'm willin' to take trips into the dark and unknown
Corners of your subconcious where the climate's cold
Use me to the fullest, it'll never get old
Forget about oppinions and the things you've been told
Use me as a courtesy for things bought and sold
Let me be an example of how to break the mold
Use me as an innocent, you need to break the hold
Use me 'til I'm gone, use me 'til I'm gone

Just inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale
Just inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, exhale
Just inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale
Just inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, exhale

Let me be the scapegoat for all your innner ???
Let me be the one you blame for all your inconsitancies
Let me be the one to solve all of life's mysteries
My quotes the annictote for all of life's missery
Study all my hard shit and learn a thing critically
Forget about the bullshit you learned back in history
Visit every continent without movin' physically
Exercise mentally, get in shape spiritually
Exercise mentally, get in shape spiritually
Give in to me and take deep breaths of my imagery
Exhale, all the hate you had for your enemy
Exhale, all the hate you had for your enemy

Just inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale
Just inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, exhale
Just inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale
Just inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, exhale
