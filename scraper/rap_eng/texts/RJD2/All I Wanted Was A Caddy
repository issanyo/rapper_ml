[Verse 1]
Born a "Carlos", but my partners call me slim
Ladies call me sugar
I call my music him
My roots is where it stem like tree branches on [?]
I'm sure you've [?] up here before because we follow them  trends
We follow them stars ain't the wisest of men (okay)
Pray the baby Jesus help decide in the end
Feel like I been here before here we go again
Put so much thought in the rhyme that I didn't pick up the pen
I been picking up the pieces where it all fell apart
Even though it couldn't bring all of these folk on the art
So how am I supposed to carry everyone on my art
And I'm the one who has to carry all of that on my heart
And now the Caddy won't start
Had to get to stoop
Hop on my bike or the bus
I got to bust me a move
That when I ran into my partner on some whoopity whoop
He said, "Where the Caddy at? I know how ya'll niggas do."

[Hook] x3
All I wanted was a Cadillac

[Verse 2]
See what had happened was
Granddaddy had a Caddy
My granny had a Caddy
My uncle had a Caddy
And all them bitches had fatties
I used to have a Chevy that was dopeboy staus
That's how I got addicted to these dopeboy habits
I used to be on [?] watching players that had
A diamond in the back with a sun roof top
And a tint limousine only the engine would stop
Even the pastor pushed the Caddy with the candy on top
So when I bought my first 'Lac', I was the man on the block
Nobody couldn't tell me nothing Shawty, hand on my cock
It's a measure of success around these neighborhood spots
But if you threw some Ds on it and the trunk got knock
All the B's would come a bustin' hoping they sit shot
And the leather's so soft like the ass on the [?]
Back seat 'bout as big as elementary cots
I been dreaming about this since like elementary, ah

[Hook]
All I wanted was a Cadillac
All I wanted was a Cadillac
All I wanted was a Cadillac

[Bridge]
Some dreams are big and some small
Some dreams will drive and some stall
Where you going when the going gets hard
Headed down heartbreak boulevard (Lac, lac, lac, lac)
Here's what we chase in them stars
'Til the day spaceships replace cars
And I park a Caddy on Mars x2
(All I wanted was a Cadillac)

[Verse 3]
I told my partner I would love to reminisce some more but I got to scoot
Got people waiting on me homie like I owe 'em some loot
Hopefully we meet again but you know life is a hoot
And I don't plan on living here forever
Ain't that the truth
Okay I gave 'em the deuce
Then I got back on the roof
Of why I wake up every morning like a blue collar dude
Should have a blue collar suit
Attach a patch with a name
Should have some steel-toed boots but that ain't part of the game
These blue suede shoes ain't made for walking in rain
These mic check 1 ,2s are all that I claim - on my income tax
So if it don't boom bap and make you get up out your seat and give your partner some dap
Or give your drive a little push when you've been stuck in a rut
Sometimes we'll all get down and need a little kick in the butt
Like when the motor won't turn over cause you burnt out the clutch
And now you gotta catch the bus cause you been chasin' a buck
(All I wanted was a Cadillac) (Lac, lac, lac, lac...)

[Hook]
All I wanted was a Cadillac
All I wanted was a Cadillac
(Comin' up down south in the 'A')
All I wanted was a Cadillac

[Bridge/Outro]
Some dreams are big and some small
Some dreams will drive and some stall
Where you going when the going gets hard
Headed down heartbreak boulevard (Lac, lac, lac, lac)
Here's what we chase in them stars
'Til the day spaceships replace cars
And I park a Caddy on Mars x2
(All I wanted was a Cadillac)
