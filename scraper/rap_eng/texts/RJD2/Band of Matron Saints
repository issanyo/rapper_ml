Sisters of the son, who want to know the ne'er
Bring love to all, who still press on
Hold to see, just one more wrong
One more time
One more time
They state their penalties, and hide the awful truth
Where they peer and in much to prove
To build tributes to a better you
Depend on matron saints, and come to here for me
With no-oh breeze, to bear more strife
Bring in air, two holes maybe
He holds his women dear, not your man of stone
Purest soul n'sullied names
Build the things that we can home
