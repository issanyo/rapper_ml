Reality we must face
'Cause day by day time goes to waste
We've got to teach the children what they should know
We've got to teach the children how they should grow

'Cause the want to learn the truth
Teach them right now

Reality we must face, oh Lord
'Cause day by day time goes to waste
We've got to clothe the naked
'Cause they are poor

We've got to care for the whole
We can do no more, oh Lord
Cause the have learned the truth
By the rules
