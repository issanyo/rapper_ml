[Intro]
Hands up, hands up, hands up

[Chorus 1]
Yo get your hands in the air
You came to party tonight
We gon' get down hell yeah
You'll have the time of your life
If you're doin' it right
If you're doin' it right
If you're doin' it right
If you're doin' it right

[Verse 1]
Ay girl you're bad as luck
Ay girl I'm mad as fuck
That we ain't never fucked
I mean, like what the fuck
(W- w- was that too abrasive for you? Uh, uh, l- lemme get that again, I got you babe, I got you babe)

Well god damn you hot as hell
I mean, I might as well
See what that might entail
I got some slight detail from your homegirl
(You know I knew your girlfriend back in the day and you know she was telling me you was looking for somebody, and uh)

So I'm Slim, but call me Sugar
She think and caught me looking
Don't trip you too good looking
Don't slip you could be looking at the future Mrs. Sugar
If she play her cards right
(and I'd get in that thing now, I tell you)

But yeah, but yeah, I came to kick it you know
Phife Dawg and Tip and Ali
Shaheed, Jarobi, my flow be
The golden ticket so you enjoy the show
And I'll be back to visit
But now I got to spit like a spigot
Get back to business

[Chorus 2]
Yo get your hands in the air
You came to party tonight
We gon' get down hell yeah
You'll have the time of your life
If you're doin' it right
If you're doin' it right
If you're doin' it right
If you're doin' it right

You got your makeup on
Girl don't hurt nobody
'Til the break of dawn
Know you came here to party
If you're doin' it right
If you're doin' it right
If you're doin' it right
If you're doin' it right

[Verse 2]
Alright, I get the stage crackin'
Shit, I get major backing
I do it for the people, Asian, white, black, and Latin
Whether you catch the bus, or you be cadillacking
And niggas looking for beef like cattle jacking
We got that, roger that
I'm a star at it, Roger Staubach
Drop back, hail Mary
2Pacalypse in my Chevrolet Bel Air, and
It's in the can, sugar man
Leonard, Shane, and Ray Robinson, well god damn
Like Cassius Clay, what'd he say?
"Shook up the world I'm a bad, bad man"
For any Sonny Liston, I hope Sonny's listening
I'm knocking niggas out, we don't do them split decisions
Nor do we split the pie with people who don't recognize
That this is something special right before your eyes
I advise...

[Chorus 3]
Yo get your hands in the air
You came to party tonight
We gon' get down hell yeah
You'll have the time of your life
If you're doin' it right
If you're doin' it right
If you're doin' it right
If you're doin' it right

You got your makeup on
Girl don't hurt nobody
'Til the break of dawn
Know you came here to party
If you're doin' it right
If you're doin' it right
If you're doin' it right
If you're doin' it right

Shout out to the brothers chilling
Ainâ€™t in they feelings
Hoes keep choosing
If you keep losing
If ain't doin' it right (hands up)
If ain't doin' it right (hands up)
If ain't doin' it right (hands up)
If ain't doin' it right (hands up)

[Outro]
Hands up, hands up, hands up
Hands up, hands up, hands up
