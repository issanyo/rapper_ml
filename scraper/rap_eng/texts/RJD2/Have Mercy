My goodness
I've been waiting for a train all morning
Lord Almighty
I got a downtown job to get to
Oh please
Got no car to bring me

God damn it
Now who's the strike really getting back at

Lord have mercy
Have mercy have mercy
On these poor fools
Lord have mercy
Have mercy have mercy
'cause I'm one too

Lord have mercy
Have mercy have mercy
On these poor fools
Lord have mercy
Have mercy have mercy
'cause I'm one too

My goodness
I've been waiting for a cheque all morning
Lord Almighty
Got healthcare bills to get to
Oh please
I'm praying you to do
But I guess it's getting back at you
God damn it

Lord have mercy
Have mercy have mercy
On these poor fools
Lord have mercy
Have mercy have mercy
'cause I'm one too
