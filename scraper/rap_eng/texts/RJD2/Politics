[Verse 1]
My head's close to exploding
I keep praying for a sound to save me here
Greed is louder than giving
I can’t understand how to cope with the feel

Of all the good that is dying
From all the takers and fools
All I know is "I'm trying"
But all that's stopping me, all that’s stopping me
Is you

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep taking away, taking away
It's you
Holding me back, holding me back
It's you, it's you

[Chorus]
Everybody knows your ways
Everybody hopes you waste away
Everybody knows your days are numbered
You fall on your politics

[Verse 2]
Now my life runs on a treadmill
I see the future, will I ever make it there?
Feel the breeze like a windmill
When people pass me, all I do is sit and stare

It's like it's tangled in front of me
I'm jumping like a bear
I try to grab it but it dodges me
And I'm never laying on the ground to submit
It’s you

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep taking away, taking away
It’s you
Holding me back, holding me back
It's you, it’s you

[Chorus]
Everybody knows your ways
Everybody hopes you waste away
Everybody knows your days are numbered

Everybody knows your ways
Everybody hopes you waste away
Everybody knows your days are numbered
You fall on your politics

[Bridge]
Now I could give into it
Could kill it today
But then who would it serve?
That would be crazy

Gotta take it on
Devil by his horns
Never give it away
No

Now I could give into it
Could kill it today
But then who would it serve?
That would be crazy

Gotta take it on
Devil by his horns
Never give it away
Never give it away

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody knows your ways
Everybody hopes you waste away
Everybody knows your days are numbered

Everybody knows your ways
Everybody hopes you waste away
Everybody knows your days are numbered
You fall on your politics
