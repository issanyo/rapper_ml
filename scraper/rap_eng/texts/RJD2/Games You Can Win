You greenhorns might cruise your way
From the basement at mom's
To a little face time someday
With the man and the clowns, but

Will it last long
Long
But will it last long
Long

Path of ambition's a field of gray
But then it won't clear
And the decisions that make grown men cry
Are waiting right here

In the wings to appear
Appear
In the wings to appear
Appear

Keep your mouth shut 'til you get 'em in
And only play the games you can win
Play your hand close
Like you had a glass chin
Now let's begin

Keep your mouth shut 'til you get 'em in
And only play the games you can win
Play your hand close
Like you had a glass chin
Now let's begin

Nobody gets to know the one right way
'Til they do the wrong ones
You can only foresee your own quaint
Little fears and problems

In the hopes to become
Become
In the hopes to become
Become

And with his own handicap at hand
He's a reckoning force
He'll eat alive all the young he sees
Who aspire to be

The proud and the sure
The sure
The proud and the sure
The sure

Keep your mouth shut 'til you get 'em in
And only play the games you can win
Play your hand close
Like you had a glass chin
Now let's begin

Keep your mouth shut 'til you get 'em in
And only play the games you can win
Play your hand close
Like you had a glass chin
Now let's begin

Keep your mouth shut 'til you get 'em in
And only play the games you can win
Play your hand close
Like you had a glass chin
Now let's begin

Keep your mouth shut 'til you get 'em in
Only play the games you can win

Let's begin

Let's begin

Let's begin

Let's begin

Let's begin

Let's begin
