To all you kind!
And to all of you sad!
To all of you ladies
And you call yourself playing

Ain't nobody knows the game you wanna play
Believe me when I say

Let's keep some good!

To all you kind!
And to all of you sad!
To all of you ladies
And you caught yourself playing
And especially to all of your living! Living! Living!
And you call yourselves pimping

To all you kind!
And to all of you sad
And especially to all of your living! Living! Living!
And you call yourselves pimping

(Play that beat)
(Hard day)
