[Repeat: x2]
Girl I know you won't come back
I've got to get a hold of this
But if it won't work out
What will I do?

If I could have my way you would
Be just a memory to fade
Until that no one here would ever find

Girl I know you won't come back
I've got to get a hold of this
But if it won't work out
What will I do?

Could've loved you
What will I do?
