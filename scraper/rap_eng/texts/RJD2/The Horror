Time, time, time, time
Trying to understand the world
Time, time, time, time
Trying to understand the monster

Time, time, time, time
Trying to understand the world
Time, time, time, time
Trying to understand the world

I will amuse myself with terror and murder
From what grave did I come?
Of what evil mixture was I compounded?
I have time, all the time I need to put an end to you
You've come to find me, to destroy the monster
I am real
No one...no one is safe

Time, time, time, time
Trying to understand the world
Time, time, time, time
Trying to understand the world
Time, time, time, time
Trying to understand the world
Time, time, time, time
Trying to understand the world
