When your head is spinning and you're feeling overwhelmed
And your ears are ringing 'cause your heart is beating so damn loud
And your mind is numbing and your heart is pumping out
Oh it feels like you're running but your feet won't touch the groundCalm down, calm down
Now all my defences are down
Calm down, calm down, calm downWhen it feels like you're tripping but you're not sure what about
You just might be slipping, ice queen is melting down
And the blood is pumping and your head is spinning round
And your heart is thumping and your tongue is hanging outCalm down, calm down
Now all my defences are down
Calm down, calm downWhen you're feeling overwhelmed, again
Calm down, calm down, calm downWhen your head is spinning and you're feeling overwhelmed
And your ears are ringing 'cause your heart is beating so damn loudCalm down, calm down
Now all my defences are down
Calm down, calm downNow you're feeling overwhelmed, again
Calm down, calm down, calm downCome back, come back, come back
Come back, come back again
Come back, come back, come back
Come back, come back again
