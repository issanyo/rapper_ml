Study this as you study your first born
My first song was pain personified in song
The longest sequence is looped for days long
Where bass kicks are fierce and snares are
Known to drop a lot quicker than a child's tears
And drown out the drama that I didn't want to share
The load I wouldn't wish upon my enemies to bear
The times I used to tell myself you didn't want to hear
Until the reason in my rhyme become clear
Now what I write makes the load a lot lighter
The story of my life epitomizes imperfection
As a musical where every scene seems to lack direction
And I stand center stage stunned by what's happening
Blinded by the lights, cameras, action
Although I never asked for this lead role
It seems that God decided it a long time ago
I was chosen for this
Given the gift to gain and maintain the crowd's cheers
I break bread over beats with like-minded peers
And share the story of my last trip into the atmosphere
On the ninth cloud, I sat Indian style
Arms outstretched and Hell in God's breath
I saw the stairway to heaven
And counted one-hundred and forty-four thousand steps
I wanted to climb but it wasn't my turn yet
So I returned to earth just before the sun set
And I could stare, waiting for this golden opportunity to share

Now I share this with you
I'll share this with you
With all of you
I'll share this with you
I'll share this with
Each and every
One of you

Now in my younger days that quickly passed
I fell asleep in history class
Not enchanted by past misery
I'd rather chase down the present with a glass of Hennessy
And tilted my flower-like childhood wilted when my innocence was secluded
Plus the water we gave to it stayed polluted like the veins of cocaine users
My blood stream's still a little murky from flash-backs of murder scenes
Medical emergencies that fell upon deaf ears
Over 8 million stories in a city that nobody wants to hear
But as bad as it appears, I am happy that I'm here

To share this with you
To share this with you
To share this with
All of you
To share this with you
Share this with you
Share this with
Each and every one of you

Heh, and share I will
I'll share the nights where fist fights left somebody's body lying still
The ice grills, the cold Ohio night's chill
I'll even share the blood spill
The memory of all my loved ones killed
The unpaid bills
The pain of a terminally ill
My ill will towards my rivals
My approach towards hip-hop survival
The circumstance that made some suicidal
The same circumstance that made others homicidal
The signs of the vital
The ways of the trial
The dope fiends that walk around my block in denial
The short life cycles
The minds that lie idle
My people that got out of court on a missed trial
My hunger to become more grounded in the Bible
Is smiled on behalf of my last day's arrival
