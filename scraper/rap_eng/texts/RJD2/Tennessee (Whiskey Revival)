[Verse 1]
See all the kin folk on my mama's side from Nashville
They used to tell me about the good old time fellow named uh
Tennessee Jack
Now this story dates back over 7 scores and two World Wars
I'm talking prohibition and all the fixings of the Red, White, and Blue
Boy it takes a great man to walk in that shoe
They said go back in time when moonshine ain't care about consolation or consequences of the man
Register the [?] and conversating Uncle Sam [?]
Jack had a plan
Jack ran away from home and was eventually orphaned taken in by a loving preacher [??]
Seemed like he took kindly to the spirits and to the [?]
At least that's how I hear
Old number 7 can be my reverend any day
[?] always take Jack to the party when I take Jill up the hill
Before we both get our thrill gotta crack open the seal
Even the women say that's a gentleman's drink
And when I say gentleman thank Frank
Three rocks of ice, two fingers, and a splash of water
Just like Sinatra did it
But I did it my way
They 'gon say I did it my way
I did it my way

[Hook - reprise]
