[Verse 1]
Live from the horizon, standing on a prayer
Nothing’s ever surprising so I don’t really care
Manipulating the moon, tired in my palm
A mind is so easy to lose in between songs
Their spirit’s flat and them ni**as is watered down
Don’t know where I’m at, not really used to this side of town
The stars calling frantic, I skydive for home
Bar-calming panic, the likewise alone
Simply sensationalize, glamorize, margin to fail
Enemies patronize, I sterilize, guarding ’til bail
Walking the high wire, light a fire under the teapot
All desire left after throwing back those three shots
Toe-tag ‘em for the cynicism sideshow
Gotta gag ‘em quick but I prefer that we ride slow
All in together now, egos in orbit
You’re feeling better now that your faith is in the mortgage

[Chorus]
Fly paper cinema dealin’ divinity
Mischievous massacre completed with secular symmetry
He never thought he’d be defeated
The blinded imagery never made him stand for a moment
He stay conceited infinitely

Fly paper cinema dealin’ divinity
Mischievous massacre completed with secular symmetry
He never thought he’d be defeated
The blinded imagery never made him stand for a moment
He stay conceited infinitely

[Verse 2]
They try to chain us to the monkey mechanism system
Then go my lobes before I ever stretch your ear to listen
I’ve been alive since before the masterpiece was finished
Letting supply drive before a single word was written
Now they typecast the outcast and bypass the circuitry
Please stash the [?], the triads is circling
Nomads are so mad there’s no path to follow
Eyes are so sad, there’s no laughs to borrow
I test my lungs’ limits, trudging through a pack a day
Wanna trust to get in my friends more than my ashtray
There’s only so much that a hardened heart can take
They don’t expect the quiet ones to make some ripples in the lake
I’ve been here before now, I’m tryna catch that feeling of euphoria that lives between the floorboards and the ceiling
Every time I think of home, they wanna throw me a distraction
Plant my flag in my passion, place faith in waves crashing

[Chorus]
Fly paper cinema dealin’ divinity
Mischievous massacre completed with secular symmetry
He never thought he’d be defeated
The blinded imagery never made him stand for a moment
He stay conceited infinitely

Fly paper cinema dealin’ divinity
Mischievous massacre completed with secular symmetry
He never thought he’d be defeated
The blinded imagery never made him stand for a moment
He stay conceited infinitely

Fly paper cinema dealin’ divinity
Mischievous massacre completed with secular symmetry
He never thought he’d be defeated
The blinded imagery never made him stand for a moment
He stay conceited infinitely
