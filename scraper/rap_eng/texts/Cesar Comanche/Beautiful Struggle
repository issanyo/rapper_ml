[Verse 1: Bekah]

I've got so many things on my mind
Sometimes I don't know where to start
I'm finding it hard to make the time
To make shit happen and get on my grind
So now it's all up to you
You need to make the first move
From here on it's only getting better
Big change, big moves, it's all coming together

[Hook: Bekah]

This is my beautiful struggle
I know what I gotta do
This is my beautiful struggle
I'm doing this just for you yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Cee]

Yo, nowadays I gotta hustle
Coz working 18 hour days on the daily is not enough dude
I got big dreams, that damn it, I'mma live up to
And I believe in me, coz homie you gotta trust you (yes sir)
I'm feeling guilty when I'm sitting doing nothing
So I'm keeping busy, grinding, with no time for the TV and man
I'm working 40 plus hours a week
In a job that ain't take me where I'm needing to be
So I, stay in the lab, making advance
Saving my cash and still getting baked with the lads
And I'm taking the chance, ain't tryina be living miserable
Big Cee, the dude, most driven of individuals
Yeah, it's so difficult to keep my cool dog
Focusing on the plan even when shit get too hard
What, I still fuck with it, struggle's all a part of it
And this is my life, my passion and man I'm lovin' it coz

[Hook: Bekah]

This is my beautiful struggle
I know what I gotta do
This is my beautiful struggle
I'm doing this just for you yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Cesar Comanche]

And it's far from finished, when you in this business
Illest ways, you gotta fight for whatever you got
Finished days can turn to night if you're ready or not
There ain't no option to falter or stop
Any second your bubble could pop
You develop a jail record or nobody considers you hot
Tiny tots inherit the right method
But the rest of us gotta make it work or we destined to rot
God bless, put you to the test, lest that you know
Could be the rationale to lest that we grow
Certain cat took his time to be his best as a pro
Gotta polish your flow, and the bills you pay depends on the show
To forgone what you planned to say
When the time for sleep's only goes away
For a strength, you walk a pail to pray
Great you holding on, could begin to flay
So I can't be long, coz the struggle, great beauty is here to stay

[Hook: Bekah]

This is my beautiful struggle
I know what I gotta do
This is my beautiful struggle
I'm doing this just for you yeah yeah
