[Verse 1: Cesar Comanche]
Woke up from a dream today.  Paid a price to sleep
Hope it won’t come true.  Man, I do pray
Started in a carway.  Ill outcome
This one scene in my head where she won’t stay
There ain’t shit I could do.  Vision true knew
That I shouldn’t hate before bed.  Yo, I’m through
Music from a didgeridoo, constant sound
In background.  All bugged out, singing blues
A mysterious man, real tall, had
No face, world in the center of his ill space
Then a book titled “Disgrace” dropped down
And the man vanished without a trace

[Hook: Cesar Comanche]
“This gift that I gave you, if mistreated
Will enslave you.”  That’s what it said
First line in black and white.  Dream on to smile
Last time I ate at night, ran through my mind
“This gift that I gave you, if mistreated
Will enslave you.”  Man, that’s deep
Feel weak, no waking up—I’m real stuck
Wish I had not fell asleep

[Verse 2: Cesar Comanche]
I ran on and you know it wasn’t long
‘Til I saw the state of the world that I was in
Expressed through sight and sound if you’re itching
To scratch and even occasional backspin
Relax if you comprehend ‘cause, with reading
Material, it’s just speaking to me, a special friend
This text is written in lyrical, yo, with nothing
Satirical.  Literal, perplex on how it ends
People were creating trends from thin air
Cornucopia styles, natural Ric Flair
Cats wanted something rare.  Then the hunger
Stopped, changed dreams into a nightmare

[Hook: Cesar Comanche]
“This gift that I gave you, if mistreated
Will enslave you.”  That’s what it said
First line in black and white.  Dream on to smile
Last time I ate at night, ran through my mind
“This gift that I gave you, if mistreated
Will enslave you.”  Man, that’s deep
Feel weak, no waking up—I’m real stuck
Wish I had not fell asleep

[Verse 3: Cesar Comanche]
Why’d the dream merchant give me the raw deals?
‘Cause serene landscape changed to dark kills
Expression is a thing of the past.  In the cash
We’re molded.  Lay in a crease, we’re folded
[Didn’t like appearance golded?].  Y’all showing
Disrespect.  Now you know what to expect
Eyes went from brown to green, sad with some
Grit to clean.  Proud man made to fiend
Straight up [?], Clone Wars
In past.  Now we’re in The Empire’s grasp
Got us chained up and caged and we’re mining
Gold and platinum, no clue that we’re slaves
A few have the heart that’s brave, made the high
And lay low with no place to go
Plans of being a pro and get your message
Heard, broadcast of blessed words
Seems absurd ‘cause the children look like
The walking dead.  Now the time came that I dread
The faceless man appeared, said, “You’re doomed
To die if you don’t understand what you have read”

[Hook: Cesar Comanche]
“This gift that I gave you, if mistreated

Will enslave you.”  Man, that’s deep
Feel weak, no waking up—I’m real stuck
