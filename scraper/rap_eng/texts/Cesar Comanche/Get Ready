[Verse One: Cesar Comanche]
You know I would be back only the fit survive
[?] for your boy without a nine to five
For this shit you can derive
Better beats, better words, better songs and I'm along for the ride
Some of my dearest compadres
Kinda like my sisters and brothers from different madres
Seeing the illest nights and the long days will tell you that
Comanche's worth [?] pays off
A lot of rap crews get laid off
Because
Lyrics are not enough
Beats ain't up to stuff
So Squirrel and the Aces made but also tough to reach
Messed up, your get graded curve
But still putting shit out so that shows a lot of nerve
[?] sounds so sweet
And the rap cats display, translate the heat
Don't sleep
You'll miss why they're preferred

[Interlude: Cesar talking]
Yeah, this is album number three. Squirrel and the Aces. So you know it's time. Yeah. It's a party y'all. C'mon

[Hook 1: Cesar] {x4}
Let's groove
Let's groove with it

[Verse Two: Median]
Hok a loogie on this here, hit 'em with the thick spit
Pitch down the middle, you get it just how we givin' it
With all the trimmings and them fringe benefits
Stay bustin' them door down, we let ourselves in here
Back in this biznitch, we so felt in here
Hot off the presses, this is fresh no iddich
So serious, no kiddin'
Squirrel came through with them Ace dudes
Embrace the crew
J-League
Thought you wasn't gon' see me?
On the low with J-Lizzy, I'm the O.D.B
Reporting for duty
I'm so unruly
Median, but really at times I'm so Moody
Lacing them 9th joints with flows so gooey
The blessing of my essence leave resin on your present
Kept in contact, get the method
But dig it
One whiff of this spliff here, you swear it's the Method

[Hook 2: Cesar]
Squirrel and the Aces come to your town it's like
All of the faces gather around at night
We bring the Jews and the Gentiles
Defendants at mistrials
And [?] there ain't no need to fight

[Hook 1]
