[Hook]
You played it safe, I raised the bar
Amazing grace, I praise the Lord
Versace store, the world is yours
Monate so, monate so
Paparazzi wanna fuck with a happy home
The shwashwi in the cut with a camera phone
Everytime we in the club it’s a family show
Take the trophy home, we the champions
Champions
Champions
Champions
Champions

[Post-Hook]
Always knew you’d be on top again
Supa Mega he on top again

[Verse 1]
Couple dalis in the cut for the ambience
But you wildin', ’bout to call you a maxi home
It’s a classic night, Friday action night
Paid the price for everything that we sacrificed
For the bragging rights
I deserve this life
It’s a perfect time to keep my circle tight
Fuck the flashing lights, fuck the plastic life
What’s the verdict when I pull up at the traffic light?
Who got the juice? Who got the juice?
Somebody make me an offer I can’t refuse
This summer we on some other “Let’s act a fool”
Do numbers like Khuli Chana with Absolut
What it look like?
Everytime we pull up it’s a good time
All in good time like good wine
Record labels acting like Suge Knight
Keep it North side
Don’t ever treat me like a popeye
I got my niggas on standby
You gon’ say hello to the bad guys

[Hook]
You played it safe, I raised the bar
Amazing grace, I praise the Lord
Versace store, the world is yours
Monate so, monate so
Paparazzi wanna fuck with a happy home
The shwashwi in the cut with a camera phone
Everytime we in the club it’s a family show
Take the trophy home, we the champions
Champions
Champions
Champions
Champions

[Post-Hook]
Always knew you’d be on top again
Supa Mega he on top again

[Verse 2]
These niggas pulling out weapons
Tryna take shots at Mega
Tell me what you know about pressure
You too busy worried ’bout blessers
Smoking that Shoprite Checkers
My impact is something you can’t measure
Who went plat without a vernac record?
Let’s talk facts and give me some damn credit
I got a few things in the cabinet
Five gold rings like a champion
And I ain’t gon change I’m a savage
Sipping rosé with the family
What it look like?
Everytime we pull up it’s a good time
Killing my vibe that’s suicide
If I get that shoe size, kiss it goodbye
No need to worry 'bout the news guy
Cause every story got two sides
We pop culture, paid the full price
For chilling poolside under blue skies

[Hook]
You played it safe, I raised the bar
Amazing grace, I praise the Lord
Versace store, the world is yours
Monate so, monate so
Paparazzi wanna fuck with a happy home
The shwashwi in the cut with a camera phone
Everytime we in the club it’s a family show
Take the trophy home, we the champions
Champions
Champions

Always knew you’d be on top again
Supa Mega he on top again

[Verse 3]
Closer to my dreams, Goapele in my genes
My nigga please, the flow a 100 degrees
You see the beams? I’m like a money machine
My legal team can’t stomach my Twitter feed
Aye, and ever since “Victory Lap”
It never felt this good to be bad
The powers that be are so mad
You ain’t sick of me yet
But lowkey they be giving me dap, that’s how the game goes
Purple rain, all I see is rainbows
I remember days when I was fucking with lame hoes
I never changed, my budget up, my chain gold
Let’s celebrate, I’m pulling up with the same bros
How the saying goes? Huh?
I paid the cost to be the boss, the main oke
I’m in the Source, you in the dark, it’s painful
Nobody got it like I got it where I came from
Cuban cigars up in your videos
Thatha ama chance, thatha ama millions
Who got the buzz? Who got the spillion?
Dala what you must, the real niggas know

[Hook]
You played it safe, I raised the bar
Amazing grace, I praise the Lord

Monate so, monate so
Paparazzi wanna fuck with a happy home
The shwashwi in the cut with a camera phone
Everytime we in the club it’s a family show
Take the trophy home, we the champions
Champions
