[Chorus: Anatii]
Time won't bring us closure
Some things are way too complicated
I'm giving you love
What you gon do for me baby
I can't function when we fight
These ups and downs are blessings in disguises
That's why I treat you like my only hope
Tell me would we survive the rodeo

[Verse 1: Anatii]
I take the league, I play for keeps
Tell me your secrets, I earned your respect
She on the defense but that's just a reflex
Let's hit the reset, pick up the pieces
I paid for that, break the bank
Don't say it's too late for that
I pray you gon stay for that
My wave is not safe to catch
Just for the record
Never under pressure
Hope they learned their lesson
We pull up, they suffer depression

[Chorus : Anatii]
Time won't bring us closure
Some things are way too complicated
I'm giving you love
What you gon do for me baby
I can't function when we fight
These ups and downs are blessings in disguises
That's why I treat you like my only hope
Tell me would we survive the rodeo

[Verse 2: AKA]
I'm way to caught up in emotion
You need to let go of the pain
You know I'll never break your heart
That's why I'm begging you to stay
Make your choice coz I can't be your boyfriend for life
There's too many voices who's gon poison your mind
I can see tomorrow when I look in your eyes
Girl why can't we just swallow our pride
Ooh special, ooh pressure
Washa we come correct
Can't knock the hustle watch out for this
Your body perfection, nobody can measure
Zaka we come collect
Roll up the Ganya, take off the edge

[Chorus: Anatii]
Time won't bring us closure
Some things are way too complicated
I'm giving you love
What you gon do for me baby
I can't function when we fight
These ups and downs are blessings in disguises
That's why I treat you like my only hope
Tell me would we survive the rodeo
