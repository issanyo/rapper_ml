[Chorus]
How you gon' be my fiancé
Living like Rihanna?
Thinking you Beyonce
Holidays with the small plane
I bought you Balenciaga
All I wanted was the small things, Kanye
808 Heartbreak
When I left my baby mama
I thought you would be my soulmate
You was a bomb babe
Now I'm talking to this bum bae

[Verse 1]
You won’t believe
All these fucken nights I go freeze
My mona lisa
She all up in the streets
Michael Angelo all up in the suites
That’s bitter sweet
Aha
Ahh
Ahhaaaa
What’s the reason that you lost faith
Sleeping at your mom’s place
Now I got some extra garage space
Dark days praying for the last grace
Wherever you are
I wonder if you doing well
Remember in London when I took you to see Miguel?
Remember when I kicked you out the hotel?
50 minutes later I was blowing up on your cell?
We was crazy since the pool on some TMZ shit
Even made the fucking news on the Mozambique trip
Long braids long breaks, India Arie shit
Front page, front page, we was still a secret

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream like déjà vu
I always remember you
Whether things are good or bad
I got the memories
Hennessy
Straight up no dash
All these things I can’t hold back
King and queen

[Chorus]
How you gon' be my fiancé
Living like Rihanna?
Thinking you Beyonce
Holidays with the small plane
I bought you Balenciaga
All I wanted was the small things, Kanye
808 Heartbreak
When I left my baby mama
I thought you would be my soulmate
You was a bomb babe
Now I'm talking to this bum bae

[Verse 2]
Always thought this shit would last forever
Now we need a miracle to make it through December
Only thing that I could do is go and get my bread up
I just can’t compete with all your BMs and your airbrush
I could tell you super quick with the real
Waited two years just to see you with your weave off
Tell me what that say about your character
You was fucking me when I was busy paying damages
Baby mama stressed out
We was in Los Angeles posting for the cameras
Acting like some savages, savages
Everywhere we went we was the main event
I know this song gon' break the internet

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream like déjà vu
I always remember you
Whether things are good or bad
I got the memories
Hennessy
Straight up no dash
All these things I can’t hold back
King and queen

[Chorus]
How you gon' be my fiancé
Living like Rihanna?
Thinking you Beyonce
Holidays with the small plane
I bought you Balenciaga
All I wanted was the small things, Kanye
808 Heartbreak
When I left my baby mama
I thought you would be my soulmate
You was a bomb babe
Now I'm talking to this bum bae
