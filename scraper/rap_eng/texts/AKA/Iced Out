[Intro: Da LES]
Yeah
Imagine just fitting on the watch
USD
Nothin no EFT
No cap

[Verse 1: Da LES]
Imagine just fitting on the watch
And the blackberry looking pretty on my socks
She thought i was Diddy on the yacht
Tryna ask Diddy when I'm not oohh
You fooling who that big bag
But the ass so big needs a kic scan
I be sitting watching barman and mixing
Fuck all these lame bitches cause they all cap yeah
Riding top down cause I'm living bro
Fuck em at the city cause I'm in the [?]
Ain't got time for no interviews
I'm rolling with my hittas all they do is shoot

[Hook : Da LES]
Balenciaga on my feet
You know I'm getting mine
Cause you know my drip is colder than the winter time
Cause you know my drip is colder than the winter time
Cause you know my drip is colder than the winter time
Iced out no leak
Go tell the time
Cause you know my drip is colder than the winter time
Cause you know my drip is colder than the winter time
Cause you know my drip is colder than the winter time

[Verse 2 : AKA]
I be laughing to the bank with my day one bro's
Pull up outside with some inside joke's
Stay real close it can get real cold
Even rolex game pow pow 5 0
I said damn niggas wanna mistake me for my paper
Damn had to play games like saga
Don't play games with brother nature
Don't buy face or say my name if you really ain't gangster
Yeah

[Hook : Da LES]
Balenciaga on my feet
You know I'm getting mine
Cause you know my drip is colder than the winter time
Cause you know my drip is colder than the winter time
Cause you know my drip is colder than the winter time
Iced out no leak
Go tell the time
Cause you know my drip is colder than the winter time
Cause you know my drip is colder than the winter time
Cause you know my drip is colder than the winter time

[Verse 3: Emtee]
Ey
I don't need negative vibes
I'm still gonna shine with or without the ice
Everything I wear is over the price
Got the chains on it can get colder tonight ey
We cooling off
We oozing with sauce
Nigga this my city ain't getting lost
Yall ain't know that they call me the boss
Tell your man to pass me the tos
I pull up 50 G's
Riding around set it deep
I do this with the squeeze
I pull up double G on me
Ain't really bout that
Ain't really bout that nah
Ain't really bout that
Ain't really bout that no
Ain't really bout that
I doubt that yeah
