[Chorus: AKA]
I really know how it feel, yeah
Be stressed out, chest out
Stomach in, chest out
Head down, grinding
Paying my dues in silence
All of my dudes is violent
Sirens, sirens
Get down, get down
Koketsa, dintsang
All of these youth is wildin'
So all of this juice inspiring
Never gon' lose my timing
Pressure produced these diamonds
Young man, young man
You can have the coupe that I'm in
All you gotta do is lalela, lalela, lalela, lalela
Amen, amen, amen

[Post-Chorus: AKA]
I really know how it feels, yeah
Stressed out, stressed out
Stomach in, chest out

[Verse 1: AKA]
If I was a president like Thabo
I would pull out all kids from Eldos
And I'll put them on the couch with Thato
That's my bros, bros, something like Bakos
10 years been the king of the castle
Break 'em all a little cheese like nachos
Big dreams, colossal
Migraines, Panado

[Verse 2: L-Tido]
Did it for my dudes in Alex
Never gon' lose my balance
No beef, salad
OG status
Low key, savage
High key, damage
Mzansi Magic
Trompies classic

[Verse 3: AKA]
Madness
Every time A nigga Come Back on Road
Actually take a little piece of my soul
That's the reason why I can't be on my own
Go

[Verse 4: L-Tido]
Cameras flashing
I just want to be in my zone
Niggas wanna talk about clothes
Fashion, hoes

[Refrain: AKA]
Hai! Lots of niggas outta line
Why? Why?

[Chorus: AKA]
I really know how it feel, yeah
Be stressed out, chest out
Stomach in, chest out
Head down, grinding
Paying my dues in silence
All of my dudes is violent
Sirens, sirens
Get down, get down
Koketsa, dintsang
All of these youth is wildin'
So all of this juice inspiring
Never gon' lose my timing
Pressure produced these diamonds
Young man, young man
You can have the coupe that I'm in
All you gotta do is lalela, lalela, lalela, lalela
Amen, amen, amen

[Post-Chorus: AKA]
I really know how it feels, yeah
Stressed out, stressed out
Stomach in, chest out

[Verse 5: AKA]
If I was a president like Nelson
I'll walk around saying, "y'all welcome"
Supa Mega long time no album
How you handle that beef? Well done
When you see me in the street
Bow down to my chi
Got the world at my feet, wagwan?
I just wanna vibe with the young ones
I don't wanna die in a Quantam
I'm a real one like Zam-buk
Yah, fucked up, blind
I hope your mama keep up with the times
I hope your father re-up on the side
I know these ballers got evil desires
They gon' pull up like a thief in the night
They gon' go home to their kids and their wife
Self-made
Mandela piece on the gold chain
I started this from a young age
I'm running shit in own lane
20 kisses on a Sunday
40 kisses on a Monday
I tell the dollies "as'hambe"
I tell them "one day is one day"

[Refrain: AKA]
Hai! lots of niggas outta line
Why? Why?

[Chorus: AKA]
I really know how it feel, yeah
Be stressed out, chest out
Stomach in, chest out
Head down, grinding
Paying my dues in silence
All of my dudes is violent
Sirens, sirens
Get down, get down
Koketsa, dintsang
All of these youth is wildin'
So all of this juice inspiring
Never gon' lose my timing
Pressure produced these diamonds
Young man, young man
You can have the coupe that I'm in
All you gotta do is lalela, lalela, lalela, lalela
Amen, amen, amen

[Post-Chorus: AKA]
I really know how it feels, yeah
Stressed out, stressed out
Stomach in, chest out

[Verse 6: L-Tido]
We was leaders of the new school
Charged up no batteries
That was way before YouTube
But I'm front page of the magazines
I was trying to feed my family
Wishing on the stars in the galaxy
Bigger picture in the gallery
Now I'm bossed up paying salaries
Feel boom with the melody
Got a big boy personality
Real toys that's motorsport
All that sweet talk give me cavities
Started home with the charity
Giving students loans to academies
I did the shit for the culture
Go ahead and get your diploma

[Verse 7: AKA]
Real ones, they can feel me and my persona
(Shuu! Shuu!)
Keep it clean with the energy
Niggas going green banomona
Been a pro since I been a kid, wozobona
Every city got me busy living in the moment
Keep the composure

[Chorus: AKA]
I really know how it feel, yeah
Be stressed out, chest out
Stomach in, chest out
Head down, grinding
Paying my dues in silence
All of my dudes is violent
Sirens, sirens
Get down, get down
Koketsa, dintsang
All of these youth is wildin'
So all of this juice inspiring
Never gon' lose my timing
Pressure produced these diamonds
Young man, young man
You can have the coupe that I'm in
All you gotta do is lalela, lalela, lalela, lalela

[Post-Chorus: AKA]
I really know
