[Hook: AKA]
I’ve been searching for someone to call my queen
They say girls like you are few and far between
Diamond ring, girl dem call me lion king
Special needs, you gon' live your wildest dreams

[Bridge: Patoranking]
Dirty dirty love, me wanna come give you mami
Dirty dirty love, me wanna come give you mami

You’re special fi mi, You’re special fi mi

[Verse 1: AKA]
Keep it one hundred
What’s the reason, I've been thinking
Someone in my bed
Pick up the pieces, we all make choices we regret
Got this voices in my head
Washa, we come correct
Can't knock the hustle, watch out for this
Hold up, lemme change your mind
I don't wanna waste no time
You should be beside me every single time we pull up at the party
Everybody gotta wait in line
Yeah
