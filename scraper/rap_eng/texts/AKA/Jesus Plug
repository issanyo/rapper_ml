[Chorus: AKA]
Ngiyaz' thandazela
We live forever
We at the top, we came to stun, no room for error
I wanna thank you for the music
I see the signs, I testify, this shit’s a movie
I say "Young man don't be too hard on yourself"
"Can't let them put no man above yourself"
For the youth dem
God help those who help themselves
Who do the most?
Now propose and make a toast
To the Holy Ghost

[Post-Chorus: AKA]
I never lack peace inside my heart yeah
I tell her let bygones be bygones
I kill em with kindness one by one
Please come one by one
Jesus is my plug

[Verse 1: AKA]
Jesus of Nazareth
Take me the moon like NASA did
Whole crew laughing to the bank again
Order another round like a pastor again
I'm a champion, give thanks to Him
That's why I'm making these gangsta hymns
Everybody ain't gon' have the gift
I might need a 16 from pastor Chris
This a big tune
No weapon formed should prosper against you
Mi casa es su casa if I dig you
But the washer is an option on the menu
Jah bless
No wahala, no stress
Holy Father, Amen (Amen)
Mega don dada, two cents

[Chorus: AKA]
Ngiyaz' thandazela
We live forever
We at the top, we came to stun, no room for error
I wanna thank you for the music
I see the signs, I testify, this shit’s a movie
I say "Young man don't be too hard on yourself"
"Can't let them put no man above yourself"
For the youth dem
God help those who help themselves
Who do the most?
Now propose and make a toast
To the Holy Ghost

[Verse 2: Anatii]
This like the rapture
Everyday niggas get captured
Jah bless to the rastas
Got the plug like adapter
If you ain't fam can't trust ya
Pray for my clan, never suffer
I bring the vice to the gospel
From the book of rhymes like Busta
If you want blessings be one
Fuck your two cents get a refund
My chakras align like Deepak
You get washed for the right reason
I broke the rules, I made the news, I paid my dues
Less announcements, more moves
Blood diamonds, I drop jewels

[Refrain: AKA]
My Lord gon' give me strength
We sing Nkosi sekelela
Never gon' slow down
God carry me whole now
My Lord gon' give me strength
We sing Nkosi sekelela
Never gon' slow down
God carry me whole now

[Chorus: AKA]
Ngiyaz' thandazela
We live forever
We at the top, we came to stun, no room for error
I wanna thank you for the music
I see the signs, I testify, this shit’s a movie
I say "Young man don't be too hard on yourself"
"Can't let them put no man above yourself"
For the youth dem
God help those who help themselves
Who do the most?
Now propose and make a toast
To the Holy Ghost

[Post-Chorus: AKA]
I never lack peace inside my heart yeah
I tell her let bygones be bygones
I kill em with kindness one by one
Please come one by one
Jesus is my plug
