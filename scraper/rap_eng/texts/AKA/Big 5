Intro

Ahh like a breath of fresh air
Its AKA up in here, Clu!
IV league baby
You know who it is
I didn't have to tell you
Mara hey, just making sure
Coming around with us


Verse 1 [AKA]
Oh Yeah!!
I'm from the jungle baby
It's the 011 in my blood that makes me
I grab my nuts with a swagger of a young Jay Z
"I live by two phrases, Fuck you. Pay Me"
My pops saying "fuck, you lazy"
So I gotta get up off this couch and get up out the house
And do a couple thousands and make a couple rounds and
Till the whole IV league is lounging, township
With lean but I spit that model C shit
(....) don't you see them?
My boy said we can get a KG from the weed man
We can sell it to students stressing before the prelims
Hold up!
I can't be no drug dealer
I'm a dreamer but fuck working for peanuts
And my team got my back like cili-postherpetic
Money on my mind and I mean it

Chorus: AKA and Clu
Ay we chasing the big 5
Just to be living the good life
Paper getting stacked up
Young black and handsome
Dreams in my head so my jeans looking heffed up
Ay we chasing the big 5
Just to be living the good life
Tryna plan a great escape
Tired of living day to day
Bounce on my walk tell you all about the paper chase

Verse 2 [Clu]

I can't start to express my love for it
Express how much I adore it
But mama raised me with no cash didn't know we were poor
Till the store manager said we couldn't afford it
So let's just walk it out cause that's what I do
Lets seat 44 now that's how I commute
You ever seat next to bumba etexing?
While the windows shut closed plus ngpandle guya shisa?
I never did try rock them Cubans sa khone
Always stood back and left inkunzi za khona
I put down laybye on some sneakers for (..)
He in a Benz i'm still repping Corollas
For that big 5 i'm gone be a game ranger
Make my way to the top and not owe you a damn favor
The soundtrack to my swagger's back
Cause we tired of s'hleli nqenge
Infact its always on my mind

Chorus: AKA and Clu
Ay we chasing the big 5
Just to be living the good life
Paper getting stacked up
Young black and handsome
Dreams in my head so my jeans looking heffed up
Ay we chasing the big 5
Just to be living the good life
Tryna plan a great escape
Tired of living day to day
Bounce on my walk tell you all about the paper chase


Verse 3 [AKA and Clu]
AKA:
Because my last name Forbes
I'm bout my business kid
Take a stand tall and make it on the riches list
Tryna stack simba chips so my kicks stay crisp
Ball so hard forgot aout when Christmas was
So roll in your Corolla or drive slow in you Polo
I love God, but God Damn I love the dough though
I grab a piece of Jesus but I grab my Jesus piece quick
Swing my chain from side to side and make these bitches Sea sick

Clu:
Ain't no limit to what money can do for ya
Paying rent, Kids getting privately schooled for ya
Royalty cheques
Income a month with two lawyers
Make sure your enemy uz' umoya
But, But who knows
What happens to those
Who die with lots of money while making it, lose souls
Giorgio Armani, Versace and Fools gold
Got me chasing wealth that will last till tombstones


Bridge: Clu
This music takes me back to the ghetto
So I hold it down for homies stuck in the meadow
From Cape to Soweto
If hustling ain't easy then let go
Tryna gas you up like you were working at Sasol
Pouring the petrol
Driving Iveco
Tryna Pull you over like they working for Metro
You making ends meet uhlalu phanda macents joe

Uncredited Outro: X2
Let me tell you wah i learn  (???)
You might have a lotta dreams but.. (???)
Them are rock ya boat see if you can stay afloat
Its a world of greed in the city of gold
