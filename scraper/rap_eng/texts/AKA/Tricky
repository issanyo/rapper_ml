[Hook: AKA}
I'm 'bout to roll up some sticky
I'm 'bout to throw on some Dickies
Mammy say she need a quicky
So I tell her wag 'n bietjie
Shit is very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very tricky
Steve Kekana to the bull shit
Do the honours if the shoe fits
Secure the bag, eh, eh
We never run out of cash
You speaking fana kalo
I'm with bafana ba North
Everytime we in the building feel like there's a million niggas tryna greet me
Balling with all of my bros
We did it all on our own

[Verse 1: Yanga]
Put me in charge of the cannabis
My shit is louder than anybody's
Choke on the power leave y'all niggas sour
Kwangen' uNtshakaza kwaphel' ipati
Pati, pati, pati, pati
Feel like it's Abu dhabi, dhabi, dhabi
Buz' abangani bami, if uz'tshela ngami then ibhadi, bhadi, bhadi
I see the Golf 4 from the roof
Lucky my Jordan 4 is shatterproof
Bitches on all floors on the fourth floor getting more souls than a future
That's what they fall for, that's the truth
Hlalisa four-four in a coupe
Even the north pole of a tjo-tjo I got more dough in the boot
Bitches be shinning and getting by
Shine like a diamond in Africa
Killing north side I'm an animal
Live like a rider fuck everybody
Power shower like every hour sending out a shout out to the streets
Yanga, Yanga, Yanga Chief
Getting gouda in a beat

[Verse 2: Gemini Major]
Shit so easy need a challenger
Your days are numbered like a calender
Wag 'n bietjie never halla back
Top of the game like a running back
I'm the freshest out the cool kids
Shout out niggas from the pool pit
Balaclava and a two key*
I'll be dropping like a poopy
Oh, ah fresh out the bed
[?] for your fears
Smoking jay in the benz
Dodging traffic to walk in
Ya, godfather soldier
Dreadlock rasta
Fresh out of Africa
They know my shit in Jamaica
Smoking with haitians
Rasta man wayase now
I am a baker
Holla nigga get your cake up
And I been dope since my water broke
And I'mma do it till I'm 44
Graduated working 9 to 5 'bout to make a million nigga work it out
