[Verse 1: AKA]
Started from bottom, was rolling around in that Toyota bakkie
The summer is ours, I’m hungry for power, Gaddafi Gaddafi
You turn on the tube and all that you see is Versace Versace
You go to my school, they can't tell you shit about Chris Hani Chris Hani
This ain’t the land of the free, no propaganda machine
Handle my flag on the screen, then light a candle for ‘Dibs
Then light a candle for ‘Dibs, okay
Smoking the jets, smoke, smoking the jets
Smoking them like cigarettes
Taking it straight to the head
Drinking Select
This is the sweetest revenge

[Hook: Yanga and (AKA)]
Nkosi sikelela, thina, thina namagenge
Godly, Godly, Run Jozi
(I'm holding the crown, my soldiers surround so throw in the towel
We come through the kitchen with owner's permission, no photo's allowed)

[Verse 2: K.O]
My flow is so harzadous
Mfanakithi, can’t nobody handle this
I annihilated all my competition so there’s no further challenges
Look, going against the authority ntwana is totally blasphemous
In a city where having no morality is totally fabulous
What’s going on with these amateurs over the internet posting some messages
Next thing you know your career is over, ntwana, over some characters
It’s the juxtaposition of choosing stupidity over intelligence
Ntombazana ushishiliza ngendunu phansi and you're hoping for happiness
Emhlabeni mel’uz’bheke, it’s crucial
Ubothemb’itshe than uthembe umuntu
They laugh in your face while they planning to shoot you
Bafuna njukuculel’amagugu
Ng’zobamba ngo-left, ngik’bambe ngo-right, mina kleva I’ll hurt you
We outchea living that Eskom life, yeah we in that power circle
See all I ever wanted was a peace of mind to speak my mind the streets are mine
Yeah I ain't even reached my prime, ng’sazokwenza dizzy blind
Ngisazokwenza busy blind
Aw mina ngiy’ntsimb’edl’ezinye, redefined
Just read between the lines and when the sparks fly hope you can see the grind
See the grind, yeah

[Hook]
Nkosi sikelela, thina, thina namagenge
Godly, Godly, Run Jozi
Nkosi sikelela, thina, thina namagenge
Godly, Godly, Run Jozi

[Bridge: K.O]
K’dala sibatshela ukuthi k’phethe thina la
Kodwa kungena ngapha kuphuma ngapha
Kungena ngapha kuphuma ngapha, kwenzenjani?
K’dala sibatshela ukuthi k’phethe thina la
Kodwa kungena ngapha kuphuma ngapha
Kungena ngapha kuphuma ngapha, kwenzenjani?

[Verse 3: AKA]
I’m something like Haile Selassie
Beautiful women and Jah seed
God-speed to my competition
Fuck whatever your palm reads
I’m on a mission like foreign militia
They're politician and hot seat
Fuck with the gods, top of the charts, name a level I can’t reach
Better check credentials, Petr Cech protect your temple
Do you want progress or you want Rolex?
Better make mine presidential, influential
More gold bottles, no role-models
This whole motto is fucked up, and we all follow
No Gupta-gate, no magistrate
Just mamis shaped like coke bottles
Bank notes falling, no foreign, no problem
Madiba faces in briefcases like Zim dollars
Say Our father

[Hook]
Nkosi sikelela, thina, thina namagenge
Godly, Godly, Run Jozi
Nkosi sikelela, thina, thina namagenge
Godly, Godly, Run Jozi
Run Jozi

[Bridge: K.O]
K’dala sibatshela ukuthi k’phethe thina la
K’dala sibatshela ukuthi k’phethe thina la
Run Jozi
K’dala sibatshela ukuthi k’phethe thina la
