[Hook: AKA]
I know, I know we just saved the day
Superhero I'm gon' need a speedo and a cape
X-ray vision through your evil ways
Tell your people don't forget to pray

[Chorus: Anatii]
Don't forget to pray, ewe
Do you know that God is on the way?
Ewe, ewe
Don't forget to pray, yea yeah
Do you know that God is on the way?
Ewe

[Verse 1]
Swag drip on you trap kids
Who do wack shit for a summer smash
Classics for you bastards
I got mad hits in the Tupperware
Gold rings like I'm Shabba Ranks
Ideas for your fucking brands
White tears in the duffel bag
I'ma die here in the motherland
Don't forget to check the blind spot
Mirror, mirror I'ma icon
Smoking til I'm on the high horse
Don't forget to get the eye drops
Please be careful what you wish for
Rock and Roll, Sex Pistols
Don't you niggas see the zip code?
Bryanston, oh no
What you know about L.E.S Mampe senior?
What you know about Gijima?
What you know about Sim Dope?
Anatii got the info
Blaq Smith got the indoor
Now you liking my photo
Catch me jumping out the Benzo
All white, OMO
Clean merch got the t-shirts
It say "Dreamwork" check the logo
Teamwork makes the dream work
That's K-Ci, Jojo
Bumped into my teacher he was riding around in a Polo
Fast forward to 2017, now I'm riding around in a four door

[Hook: AKA]
I know, I know we just saved the day
Superhero I'm gon' need a speedo and a cape
X-ray vision through your evil ways
Tell your people don't forget to pray

[Chorus: Anatii]
Don't forget to pray, ewe
Do you know that God is on the way?
Ewe, ewe
Don't forget to pray, yea yeah
Do you know that God is on the way?
Ewe

[Verse 2: Anatii]
Huh, ah yeah
Tyhini kwedin'
Abantwana ba no lwimi
Imali ingena noba nini
Gqibe sizthenge zombini
Sorry andikuva uthini
Kukhw' i-Tiger ku le-Jean
Gucci pair though no Supreme
Helped a nigga self esteem
Shit, nigga had to come clean
Super heroes I had to intervene
Diamonds on that Billie Jean
Zikhanya ngathi kuse mini
In the booth like Clark Kent
In the coupe like Bruce Wayne
Face lift that's a new thing
Finna do it for the youth then
If these niggas acting two faced
Bathetha ikaka ngathi it’s Brooklax
We ain't fucking with your new tracks
But you already knew that
Vuka, suzula
Vile, suphupha
Nd'mile, gugqa
Vula, hey! Funxa
Don't know the name? Google
I been all types of vodoo (sangoma)
Holy matrimony crucial (siyabonga)
I know they hating kubuhlungu
UChubby usingle like uLuther
Benzo tint darker than Kunta
Loud pack inalevumba
Jacket like ndixelé igusha

I know, I know we just saved the day
Superhero I'm gon' need a speedo and a cape
X-ray vision through your evil ways

[Chorus: Anatii]
Don't forget to pray, ewe
Do you know that God is on the way?
Ewe, ewe
Don't forget to pray, yea yeah
Do you know that God is on the way?
