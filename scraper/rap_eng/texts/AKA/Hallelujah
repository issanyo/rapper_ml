[Intro: Du Boiz]
You ready?
Okay, I'm going in
Mmmmm-mm

[Hook: Du Boiz]
Hallelujah, I'm tryna get the moolah
Hallelujah, I'm tryna get the moolah
Hallelujah, I'm tryna get the moolah
Hallelujah, I'm tryna get the moolah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Du Boiz]
I pull up in the hood and looking hella good
I got my neighbors on the windows
Hurt 'em to the foot, I'm always in the mood
I beat it up like a hero
Yield a game of pulling dildos
Smashing, grabbing all the widows
They put me in the box, I'm rapping with the gods
Angihambi ngedwa, ngihamba nedlozi
Huddle, huddle, huddle, huddle up, too busy talking to the governor
Handi kongo shimaliwa, let's take it to another caliber
I did a joint with uTyga, Tyga
Pro Kid told me pusha phanda
Mr Hotstix told me own another
I'm surprising niggas like I'm undercover
Hit the pussy like it ain't a thing
Always needed that one win
My granny told me that she's proud of me
I say fuck all you haters, I got a dream
Le ntwana encani with a passion
I'm so fueled up like I'm Sasol
The only up and comer with unumber, number
Shoot the game up, now we airborne

[Hook: Du Boiz]
Hallelujah, I'm tryna get the moolah
Hallelujah, I'm tryna get the moolah
Hallelujah, I'm tryna get the moolah
Hallelujah, I'm tryna get the moolah
Yeah

[Verse 2: AKA]
I'm so high, I need a parachute
I'm so fly, I need a cabin crew
You got issues with my attitude
Grab a tissue and a camera too
Take a picture, take a picture
Take another for your sister
Tell the youngins what you stand for
They gon' take it to the dance-floor
I say fuck the haters, I ran out of patience
Outta pages in my passport
I'm too wavy for the platform
Every time my name is in the tabloid
Every summer there's another up and comer
Who consider me an OG
All I ever wanted as a youngin' was to be the one who lift the trophy
Sit back like Terror Squad, FNB niggas credit fraud
All this money I could write a chart
I can't even find a date to shop
I can even buy a decent watch
I'm still beefing with my body clock
Supa Mega got the answers
Keeping it coming with the anthems
Competition get the white flag
January get a nice tan
Ray Charles to a price tag
40 racks on the backpack
Never Snapchat, never hashtag
In the Gucci store with my pants sag
Mabala Noise got the right plan
Supa Mega got the lifespan

[Hook: Du Boiz]
Hallelujah, I'm tryna get the moolah
Hallelujah, I'm tryna get the moolah
Hallelujah, I'm tryna get the moolah
Hallelujah, I'm tryna get the moolah
Yeah
