[Pre-Chorus: Anatii]
Mama used to tell me, take your feet off the couch
Now they treat me like I'm the man of the house
Do you got the plug, do you believe in yourself?
Pray I don't get up if you kick me when I'm down

[Chorus: AKA]
Now if I told my story, it's gon' take a while
Power and the glory, me and my paper now
I come through the kitchen, that's that DoggyStyle
Say I'm too ambitious, how you like me now?

[Verse 1: Anatii]
My shit never sinking, I think out the box
I promise with the pinky, smash it out the park
My mind like Da Vinci, it's a work of art
A promise never empty, I take that shit to heart
Stopped aiming for the charts, I'm spraying with the Uzi
Beiber, Las Vegas with the shots, pour up another cup
How we raising in the club, this life is complicated
But we made it to the top
I swear, y'all too caught up in the lifestyle
Got the AP with the ice now, can't negotiate the price down
Mama told me get a nice job, four seasons on the night gown
Bank account will raise your eyebrows
Mama said don't do drugs, but the loud will knock your lights out

[Pre-Chorus: Anatii]
Mama used to tell me, take your feet off the couch
Now they treat me like I'm the man of the house
Do you got the plug, do you believe in yourself?
Pray I don't get up if you kick me when I'm down

[Chorus: AKA]
Now if I told my story, it's gon' take a while
Power and the glory, me and my paper now
I come through the kitchen, that's that DoggyStyle
Say I'm too ambitious, how you like me now?

[Verse 2: AKA]
Everyday I had to sacrifice, on my way to get to paradise
Need a safe for my accolades I ran out of space like a satellite
I remember that Toyota Bakkie, uncle helped me get the engine running
Put me on with some petrol money, get a Sean Jean sweater for me
I ain't  checking for the next dude, I'm too focused on the chess moves
Jewish lawyer in a french suit, send my daughter to the best school
I don't do it like the rest do, Super Mega to the rescue
Middle finger to the photo credit, y'all too busy looking photogenic
Whatchu know bout Yanga, spend a whole summer in the dungeon?
Busy cooking number one sound, real makoya no Zambuk
Suck a dick if you don't recognize, all my records stand the test of time
Overseas, I get to cheddar cheese, been a Major Key, like Gemini
Got my eye on the prize, sick and tired of business trying to survive
Ubuntu say we should try to become
But it's 100K for the flyer design
Follow the sign, swallow your pride
God will provide
This shit is all in your mind

[Pre-Chorus: Anatii]
Mama used to tell me, take your feet off the couch
Now they treat me like I'm the man of the house
Do you got the plug, do you believe in yourself?
Pray I don't get up if you kick me when I'm down

[Chorus: AKA]
Now if I told my story, it's gon' take a while
Power and the glory, me and my paper now
I come through the kitchen, that's that DoggyStyle
Say I'm too ambitious, how you like me now?
