[Intro: Anatii]
Mmm
Mmm
Mmm
Ah

[Chorus: Anatii]
We just low-key, can't announce it (can't announce)
With the angels in the mountains
Holy water in the fountains (on the mountains)
All the blessings now we counting

[Post-Chorus: AKA & Anatii]
Where my niggas?
It's another episode
All my niggas who coming with us on the trip
Altitude 'bout to change in a minute
You need to live
You need to live

[Refrain: Anatii]
This is the slow down
It's 'bout to go down, yea
It's 'bout to go down
Nobody out there know the low down, yea
Sip of the slow down, yea
It's 'bout to go down, yea
It's 'bout to go down
Nobody out there know the low down, yea

[Verse 1: Anatii]
On the couch, Oprah
Sipping that soda
Diamonds are Pneumonia
Giving you a cold crush
Call up my chauffeur
We living la vida loca
Dipping in a Rover
Seats are color of Mshoza
I can't be caught up in emotions
My shawty texting me emojis
You know I'm gone off the potion
You know I gotta stay focused
I thought I told you no photos
We can't do this in the open
Baby now don't get your hopes up
There's plenty fish in the ocean

[Bridge]
Holy, holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy matrimony
Only God remote control me
Fire match, a cup of coli
Two klipa in the cabi-hold
Sexy chubby nigga that's the old me
Grinding, grinding on the stripper pole
Man I treat your girl like a jockey

[Chorus]
We've been low-key, can't announce it (can't announce)
With the angels in the mountains
Holy water in the fountains (on the mountains)
All the blessings now we counting

[Post-Chorus: AKA & Anatii]
Where my niggas?
It's another episode
All my niggas who coming with us on the trip
Altitude 'bout to change in a minute
You need to live
You need to live

[Refrain: Anatii]
This is the slow down
It's 'bout to go down, yea
It's 'bout to go down
Nobody out there know the low down, yea
Sip of the slow down, yea
It's 'bout to go down, yea
It's 'bout to go down
Nobody out there know the low down, yea

[Verse 2 : AKA]
Thank the heavens I count all my blessings in the skies
I got a peace of mind
Every time it's number seven when I roll the dice
I got the eagle eye
Everybody know what's up
Every kasi show us love
Toast to shawty
It's Diwali when we in the club
It's a problem when the water is thicker than the blood
SupaMega, super unlock
First impression, you get one shot
Legendary yet you hit the Henny
Shit gon' leave the telly, word to sponsor
Famous the number one drug
Sipping champagne like papsuck
Solid gold chain, they can throw shade
But I do it, do it for the culture
Aye
I ain't fucking with your energy
Enemies and the bitches looking
'Cause we cooking, cooking with the paraffin
All you niggas is some jelly beans
Elevated to Mandela suite
We in the house
I treat the couch like club promoter shop at Ellerines

[Chorus: Anatii]
We just low-key, can't announce it (can't announce)
With the angels in the mountains
Holy water in the fountains (on the mountains)
All the blessings now we counting

[Post-Chorus: AKA & Anatii]
Where my niggas?
It's another episode
All my niggas who coming with us on the trip
Altitude 'bout to change in a minute
You need to live
You need to live

[Refrain: Anatii]
This is the slow down
It's 'bout to go down, yea
It's 'bout to go down
Nobody out there know the low down, yea
Sip of the slow down, yea
It's 'bout to go down, yea
It's 'bout to go down
Nobody out there know the low down, yea

[Outro: Anatii & AKA]
(Can't announce) yeah
(We were unannounced) nobody
(announce)
Slow down
Going down
(Can't announce)
On the trip
(We were unannounced)
Eh, change in the
Slow down
It's another episode all my niggas
