[Verse: Tumi]

If you tilt your head and squint your eyes, it might come to you, this light shines through you, Levels...
The unsettling age of Biker-Leathers and Jays, Mabhebheza's afraid, tell her we like Mandela at 80, no Dompas, he unlocked the gate
Or we small time cage cause we don't pass standard 8, Levels...
We don't pray the devils, we praise ourselves out of shelters, Humble-Pie don't satisfy our taste, Levels...
We grew from taxi route to short left in a jumbo jet, that's 1st class to a high self, Levels...
Chase waterfalls and stream songs, connect Brenda, Steve Jobs and King Forbes, Levels...
