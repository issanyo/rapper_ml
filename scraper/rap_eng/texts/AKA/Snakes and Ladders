Chorus [AKA]
Riding with my gangster on
Seat level and it really don't matter
On my way to make her fall
Last two was tryna get famous
I just wanna play my part
This game of snakes and ladders
Only gonna make us strong
Gonna make us strong

Verse 1: [AKA]
Somebody tell me what we doing in this Goddamn club
Party all night drink too much
Looking in the wrong place if you trying to find true love
Living life in a polystyrene cup
Plastic! Everything I touch is a drug
And every girl I fuck got a grudge
Everybody watch what I does
Warm handshake between my old ace ain't what it was
Girl, understand me now
All of a sudden everybody family now
All of a sudden everybody: "Hand me out"
I could never let you motherfuckas drag me down
Strike a pose for the Kodak moment
Take another shot keep the good times rolling
Pussy like the ocean, he is moses
The good die young guess I'm one step closer

Chorus [AKA]
Riding with my gangster on
Seat level and it really don't matter
On my way to make her fall
Last two was tryna get famous
I just wanna play my part
This game of snakes and ladders
Only gonna make us strong
Gonna make us strong


Verse 2 [AKA]
Me and the money got a fatal attraction
They put it in my hands still evaded my taxes
Paper clips and rubber bands, pardon my fashion
My pockets on sag, I be pulling my pants up, but never mind
Everybody rap these days
Trapped in a maze full of rap cliches
Summertime, in the limelight we bake
On the way to get any bottle he say
But wait
Where the fuck was you when I was uncomfortable but didn't have a spare buck for change
All black tux better handcuff your bae
Throw your hands up paper bags up we paid!
Hey!! don't stop till 6 in the morning
Take a tape and confetti keep falling
Black parade, say a prayer for your daughters
Fuck maintain bro I gotta keep... (laughs)


Chorus [AKA]
Riding with my gangster on
Seat level and it really don't matter
On my way to make her fall
Last two was tryna get famous
I just wanna play my part
This game of snakes and ladders
Only gonna make us strong
Gonna make us strong

Verse 3 [AKA]

Seems like everybody got a hidden agenda
Screen time make it hard to figure who friends are
Peace sign baby I'll be gone till November
Petite size, in between thighs I end up
Street lights!
Baller types pulling they Rolls up
Girls in the bathroom powdered they nose up
The old ones thinking "Not one of them showed love
Before we had dough got a wife at home"
But the gold dust, keep calling them backwards
Bankers, athletes, balling for practice
Back seat, got a bitch, better than last week
New freak shit is all part of the routine
Modimo! girls keep swelling my ego
Blockbuster nights and my life is lead role
The fame change nothing about you, the fame change people around you

Chorus [AKA]
Riding with my gangster on
Seat level and it really don't matter
On my way to make her fall
Last two was tryna get famous
I just wanna play my part
This game of snakes and ladders
Only gonna make us strong
Gonna make us strong
