[Verse 1: Khuli Chana]
Look, I ain’t got half of Bouga's buzz, but everybody’s watching
I ain't said a word why is everybody nodding
O sheba kae you ain’t never seen me coming
Number hae so e cale, already everybody bubbling
I’m a pro, throw a fit if it don't make a profit
50 g’s is a show, hey nigga bout to top it
Now hao na nyuku, why you digging in your pockets
Hao na luto, leave that part out you ain't gonna pop it
Stop it, c top it, bona I got this
Remind me, first I got to cash this deposit, lefatshe
Ours for taking, hao sa le jentle then you’ll be a star in the making, lezwente
Pilo e thata, number one C.H.I.E.F Rocka
Khuli Chana, P.H, We ain't stopping
We got a new one, busting and we ain’t knocking

[Hook]
We gone' do it
Hape le hape (x7)

[Verse 2: AKA]
Every time I’m spitting, they say this shit is God given
Nobody been official as me in a hard minute
There’s plenty of other fish in the sea
But I can get Christopher Reeves out of his seat, when I’m finished
I once heard that Motswako was the family tree
Now we raking the leaves plus raising our seeds
Trust it, P.H, Raw X on the beat

[Verse 3: Zeus]
We gon do it over and over, again and again
I keep coming
In, coming to win I keep
Running again, breaking out
Setwana sa teng, monate wa teng
State that I’m in
I see the roster it states that I’m in
Like Bele,  first pick Gordon Igesund
Turn up my Mic man, the whole crowd is listening
I’m glistering, and they wish that I would
Roll Like A Michelin
New heights from Maf-town
The dope that I’m giving in

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Reason]
Reason the mass on that Konka Konka
With cats that have been cool
Since Thoia Thoing was
I was 19 since when
6 bop was blowing up
And since then I grew a few thousands
While blowing some
I mean my album is doing
Jus alright, I just need a toss
I Just Need A Tall Stack Of Dough Like Maftown Height
Alright, hustling for pleasure I’m
Like fuck those guys, number
One is kinda better when it pops off
Twice, like

[Verse 5: Towdee]
The vibe is nice and easy
Wa bona le wena
And I am just peaceful
Go bona wena, but the
South, west and east in
Another rand, you now
Rocking with the ‘‘T’’ of the
Double tswaknificent
Quick the club silican
Lose source of Maf-town
Thickening in ocdivicance
Split out le re ke teng
Split out all dividends
Miller pushing up the heights, so

We got to do it again
You my friend

[Hook]
