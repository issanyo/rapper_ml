[Chorus: Tweezy]
I do this for my day ones
They with me struggling back in the day ones
Ever since a nigga came up
From amajita to all of the bae ones
Ama day one
All of my niggas is all my day ones

My day ones (heh ehe) x 4

[Verse 1: Kwesta]
I’m talking ‘bout jitas who never knew shit about shit until I brought it to K1
Not them bitches who brought it to Kong screaming this here a hit man
That dinner is bacon
Ungakhiphi nendaba zai izolo
Sek’fike mina madoda
Uthini heh mchana?
Uzogoba se ifikile imillie yaGod
I praise God
I gave up Buttabing but I made up for it
Now I got you bae up on it
I just laid up on the thing
Now I’m just thinkin what she gave up
Hola mpinch
I really think if I really think I’d make shit realler than you'd ever think
Bring your game uzo dealer nama ZimZim
Angimbizi mina but I swear I can make your bae come
Hey Gazi
We’re made now
When you’re too raw you’re too much for them
When you got ballz you’re too nutz for them
When you black out on every track out they wanna lash out
I klu klux on ‘em
I say fuck all em
Got this ngiyaba siza
Cup on em
I got my chucks on
Ngipheth’ ikasi lonke
Bayazi bonke it ain’t much

[Chorus: Tweezy]
I do this for my day ones
They with me struggling back in the day ones
Ever since a nigga came up
From amajita to all of the bae ones
Ama day one
All of my niggas is all my day ones

My day ones (heh ehe) x 4

[Verse 2: Aka]
This shit is for my day ones in the trap
Before the dab and the fake love
We were standing in the same dust
Now you got to think twice when we’re in the same club
Do you you ever read the papers?
Do you think the money changed us?
Do you blame us?
Roof back for my day ones
Running with the wolf pack but I ain’t Aewon
Now I’m in a different lane
Running this game
Skwatta campaign
Niggas got pistols aimed
Tryna take shots
Fuck what the system say
I’ma keep toppin’ these charts
And they said this rap shit was just a phase
Now the bitches call me bae God
Blind to the bullshit Ray Charles
Day One
Bridges burn and tables turn and that’s justice
We just caught between different worlds
And these girls are not to be trusted
Heart beating like dubstep
It’s like MD and my cup wet
You mix Hennessy with enemies
That jealousy I don’t fux with

[Chorus: Tweezy]
I do this for my day ones
They with me struggling back in the day ones
Ever since a nigga came up
From amajita to all of the bae ones
Ama day one
All of my niggas is all my day ones

My day ones (heh ehe) x 4
