Supa Mega, how you handle all the pressure?
Paper chasing, they forever changing like the weather
Niggas touch down then they whole voice switch up
So I ain't about to start calling tomato sauce "ketchup"
Please refresh us, swag dripping, you need a napkin
My bad, I mean a serviette, part of my accent
Check the flag, we on the map, Google the address
Even the tat is Michael Jackson with the black skin
Wake up, wake up, get a piece of the action
I'm in a different race, this the victory lap
54 African states and throwing no Shade- 45
Tell me today, do Sway got the answers?

What's the reason people hate when you elevate?
Season after season, pocket full of Mandela face
Jesus piece on me just in case niggas demonstrate
Every time I take a bite to eat, it's expensive taste
Think about my, my, my daughter back home
She taking her baby steps and I'm always on road
See your daddy is an all star, Moses Malone
Got me striking poses like I'm on cover of Vogue
I suppose I just wanna be a legend in the worst way
Never really wanted to be famous in the first place
You're my pride, you're my little Miss Perfect
I just hope I make it back in time for your birthday

It's a long way down when you winning
Need a break from the handshakes and the gimmicks
Not much left to be said in my lyrics
Now they got me sitting in the same damn chair as Xzibit
Pardon me, I just couldn't resist
I'm the man of the moment, my flow is as good as it gets
Awe ma se kind represent us let's turn up
Kiss my ring Jah bless the Third World bars

Oh well, maybe I should just go off of the dome
After I freestyle I call my mom on the phone
I just pulled up in a yellow cab but never that, back home it's X6 M, black mags
I be reppin' that black flag like ISIS...

(Change of beat)

Supa Mega got a lot of prescence
Told myself I was a legend since an adolescent
Learned my lesson, get a message wasn't tired, aggressive for sure
Now every new nigga need a blessing from the rap god
I developed back probs, that's what happens when you have to carry niggas that long
Pussy nigga wish I woud diss you to give you a platform
You need to politick less and rap more
Please remember I come from the era of the clap song
Now every second record is a trap song
Shit is cold but the throne keep my ass warm
When I drop, game over like the black ball
No subliminal jabs...
If I see you I guarantee you they gon' witness a criminal act
I think I reached my potential too fast
I hope his peeps got the casualty's funeral plan
I take a sip off that styrofoam
I smoke as in a flight mode
I'm in a different time zone
Daddy cool, 22 Michellin tyres on
Bang! I bang, I bang, I'm a savage
I'm the one who put the city on the atlas
Yeah-yeah, Supa Mega I'm established
Oh yeah, 'bout to send the Uber to your address
