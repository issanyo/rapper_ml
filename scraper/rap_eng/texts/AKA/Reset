[Pre-Chorus: AKA]
You don’t wanna wanna see me flex no
I’m gon' drown my sorrows in that demi sec, Jazzy Jeff
Drinking out of the bottle like we Romeo and Juliet
If I lose it all tomorrow will you still be here?

[Chours: JR]
Why you blowing up my iPhone?
Why ung'buza ukuthi ngibuya nini? Wena mind yours!
Tell how you want your Milo?
You used to be my side & now you chilling in the wife zone

[Verse 1: AKA]
Tell me would you still be there if I was a weed head with Unathi dreads? Yeah
Tell me would you still be there if I never pulled up in white BM'?
Reebok and a icy wrist make a nigga say 'tsek to a Nike cheque
Blaq Smith on the private jet he gon' take a snap shot of the BBS
If I was a throw back like drop top?
Would you put me in a box like Papsak?
If I ain't had it lock like rastas?
If I shapa chiskop like Busta?
Nkalakatha, MDZ
Everywhere like MTN?
Wafa-Wafa er' weekend
She gon' pull up in a maxi cab

[Pre-Chorus: AKA]
You don’t wanna wanna see me flex no
I’m gon' drown my sorrows in that demi sec, Jazzy Jeff
Drinking out of the bottle like we Romeo and Juliet
If I lose it all tomorrow will you still be here?

[Chorus: JR]
Why you blowing up my iPhone?
Why ung'buza ukuthi ngibuya nini? Wena mind yours!
Tell how you want your Milo?
You used to be my side & now you chilling in the wife zone

[Verse 2: AKA]
Tell me would you still be here if a rich nigga sent you a spicy text?
Tell me would you still be here if I never pulled up with a icy neck and shot of Courvoisier?
If I had dicey cred' would you slice me bread?
Or would I be slightly dead if a billionaire was in your DMs?
Look at what egoli did
Go ahead girl talk your shit
Overseas with hommies that gon' treat Veuve Rich like Yogi Sip
I'm tryna give you my everything
Is you in the trap or you in the house or you wanna flex like Tellaman?
Tell me what you want let's get it then

[Pre-Chorus: AKA]
You don’t wanna wanna see me flex no
I’m gon' drown my sorrows in that demi sec, Jazzy Jeff
Drinking out of the bottle like we Romeo and Juliet
If I lose it all tomorrow will you still be here?

[Chorus: JR]
Why you blowing up my iPhone?
Why ung'buza ukuthi ngibuya nini? Wena mind yours!
Tell how you want your Milo?
You used to be my side & now you chilling in the wife zone

[Verse 3: Okmalumkoolkat]
You remember when we shaying combos
You remember chilling in the jondol
You be playing games like Nintendo
Kodwa mtwan' omuntu ngiyak'thanda
Nowadays you do it for the likes
Iciniso liyababa, where the ice?
I'm about my money, ngiyasebenza
All over my business in a handle
I could put you up in a mansion
Sidle i-lifestyle, sidle i-Sandton
Yaz' abanye abantu banomona
K'dala sihlanganisa now we're on
Told you I could take you to the top
You would never ever smell a four star
Put you on the spovas not a All Star
I'mma take you out, sidle i-Lobster
Cava that combo his and hers
Spura samaluda she the best
Cava car keys, cav' the purse
She love the palm trees and the sand
We go 50/50 on the Benz
We go 140 on the dash
We been tryna get it living fast
Amalobolo is in the plans

[Pre-Chorus: AKA]
You don’t wanna wanna see me flex no
I’m gon' drown my sorrows in that demi sec, Jazzy Jeff
Drinking out of the bottle like we Romeo and Juliet
If I lose it all tomorrow will you still be here?

[Chorus: JR]
Why you blowing up my iPhone?
Why ung'buza ukuthi ngibuya nini? Wena mind yours!
Tell how you want your Milo?
You used to be my side & now you chilling in the wife zone
