[Verse 1: Wizkid]
Don't fuck around, I got my pistol on me
So much money, I got money on it
I let my mama hold a hundred thousand
I let my sister hold two hundred thou
Krapa, fasa, baba let's
Private jets in my Jays
Ka phona uber ya I'm late
Ya bana manje se ba late

[Refrain: Wizkid] (x2)
Rasta, roll up the weed one time
Give me that cheese one time
I wanna feel cool one time
Give me that tree one time
Fuck that bitch one time

[Verse 2: Wizkid]
I pray, love come my way
She knows she loves my way
My love for money got me working on a Saturday
My love for money got me grinding on a Sunday
I know you love my way
I pray, love comes my way
My love for money got me working on a Saturday
My love for money got me grinding on a Sunday

[Hook: Emtee]
If she tripping leave that bitch alone
That's why you never catch a nigga sober
Hotboxin' til the spliff is over
I'm never scared, got no pistol on me
Krapa, fasa, baba let's start rolling up the jets (x2)

[Verse 3: Emtee]
No matter what I know they see us
I see they hating that's cause we up
Stop talking like a G, yo
This is no remix, this the re-up
Azishe one time, s'phile one time
Akufiwe one time, siz'wise one time
Sin'bise one time, nani n'fike one time
Roll up one time, then we smoke some one time
I'm on the scene clever ungazong' tshela
I got Wiz, I got Supa Mega
Do it if you think you better
Ngizokushaya nge s'cima if you think you clever

[Hook: Emtee]
If she tripping leave that bitch alone
That's why you never catch a nigga sober
Hotboxin' til the spliff is over
I'm never scared, got no pistol on me
Krapa, fasa, baba let's start rolling up the jets (x2)

[Verse 4: AKA]
I'm catching flights while niggas catch emotions
These flashing lights will make you lose your focus
That's that reason I'm so antisocial
Season after season, cheese at my disposal
A week in Mozambique to catch my breath
Smoke a lot of dank, brush up on my Portuguese
Yeah the crown heavy on my head
It's a lot of pressure
Clouds of the Mary Jane help me get perspective
Higher grade, dumb it down
Blowing pounds, ganja clouds
Way way out in London town, nearly missed my baby ultrasound
We been through this shit before
Niggas talking greasy on the TV, that's that cooking oil
Trouble's what you looking for
When the fam' come through, all we ever do is flex
Tryna make handsome loot, shoutout my Sandton crew
Emtee we in this sitch'
Feel like it's time to roll another jet
Yeah, yeah watch me suffer from success

[Hook: Emtee]
If she tripping leave that bitch alone
That's why you never catch a nigga sober
Hotboxin' til the spliff is over
I'm never scared, got no pistol on me
Krapa, fasa, baba let's start rolling up the jets (x2)

[Verse 5: Emtee]
There they go talking like they know
Me and you is not the same bro
I'm getting in cause I prayed yo
They dancing, but who is to blame though? (Me)
I be on the phone talking 'bout some deals phela
I'm working hard so don't you hate on me, I been fed up
Uthatha ma chance and you think you gonna win? Never!
Mawuphethe mali uyaphaula kanti yin' clever?
Woah, out here with them OG's baby
Your boyfriend acting like he know me baby

[Hook: Emtee]
If she tripping leave that bitch alone
That's why you never catch a nigga sober
Hotboxin' til the spliff is over
I'm never scared, got no pistol on me
Krapa, fasa, baba let's start rolling up the jets (x2)
