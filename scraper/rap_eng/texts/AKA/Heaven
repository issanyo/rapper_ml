[Verse 1: AKA]
How the fuck we go so hard
Working all god damn day get no reward
Better get on your marks, get set go
This don’t take no days off
I put my plan in motion, your swag is broken
These songs I’m making got this nation under mass hypnosis
We don’t fuck with you assholes gassed up like Castrol
More stamps in my passport that’s bad news like tabloids
Came up on that Death Row, West Coast, Bad Boy
I was ducking my landlord looking out for my standpoint
I’m Sami Sosa, they catch emotions
Mamis lack composure when the camera flash is open
Paper planes get me lifted they say Red Bull give you wings
I can sit you in business, a power trip you should tip

[Hook: AKA & Da L.E.S]
I’m fresh to death in this motherfucker
My ass is crazy, I’m in a 7
Now can you parallel in this motherfucker?
Im high as heaven I bust it open seven eleven
(Go girl I bust that pussy open) Im high as heaven
(No doubt smoke good shit) Im high as heaven
(Lets smoke some tress) Im high as heaven

[Verse 2: Da L.E.S]
It’s funny how shit change with a little foreign exchange
Bitches doing shit strange, for a little shit change
And niggas wanna act like, they ain’t finna act right
When I order my shit though, bring mine with a flashlight
Got a milli in my pocket and it feel so good
With just a little profit man the whole city shook
But I don’t give a fuck cause I’ma get back to it
And my kick-game nigga nigga sick like ugh
Don’t give a fuck when I’m skating these streets, and bitches all over this motherfucking beat, that foreign ah, legs spread – Jordan sign

[Verse 3: Maggz]
Ok I can’t lie, I’m smoked up namageng’ ami and we roll the tenth time
We choked up on that good stuff and we flowing damn high
On beats we owning the streets and that’s no fucking damn lie/ I know Soweto testify.
Alright, call us up cause we’re kings on,for this balling shit we got rings on
New whip two chicks with her friends in the mix and you know these bitches gon’ cling on
Star-trekking,I’m Jason Statham on that bar action
A few shots and she’s expendable
Got her in the car laughing like Athi kimi: “Maggazini, awung’thathe s’hambe s’ye kini”
Ngam’ tshela straight: “I’m too high to drive and I’m way over my limit”
Wathi kimi: “no biggie
Let’s do backseats and get kinky” ngathi
“K my love you’re too cool as fuck” as I’m burning down my sticky
