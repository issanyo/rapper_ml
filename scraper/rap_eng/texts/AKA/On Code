[Verse 1 – M.I Abaga]
I just a milli in the bank
And my accountant told me thanks
So I told him when he’s filling in the blanks
Put my name as G cause i swear i be feeling really grand
Listen, this is how you know that i’m the man
I’m a stand up guy even when i’m sitting down
Nigga, ten years i’ve been in demand
What you’re worth in pounds, boy i’ll double that

[Verse 2 – AKA]
I just took a six hour flight from the south
I’m a long way from the house
Whole time you was sitting on your mama couch
Money on my mind got me thinking out loud
Teacher teacher take a picture look at me now
Riding with the Monalisa we the talk of the town
Feeling like Sean ’cause I’m finally famous
Looking at my passport I'ma need pages
VIP tables looking like Star Wars
That's word to the choc boys, fuck boys
Talk shit till they get lockjaw
Say my name, say my name like it tastes like hot sauce
Everything is on code
When I get in my zone
Boss up, yeah the music is a weapon
Third World Boss Super Mega

[Chorus]
You know we in the club on code (we just flexing)
You know we handle business on code (yeah we ballin)
You know we making money on code (huhn)
And shorty trying to get it on code (tell her send ***)
You know we in the club on code (we just flexing)
You know we handle business on code (we making money)
You know we making money on code (huhn)
And shorty trying to get it on code (tell her send ***)
