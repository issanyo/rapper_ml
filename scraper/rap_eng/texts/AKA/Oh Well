[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
I feel like myself (nobody else)
I kiss I might tell (I might, I might)
You mad wait, oh well
Ya, ya oh well
Ya, ya oh well
Ya, ya oh well

[Verse 1: Sy Ari Da Kid]
When I see the money do the running man (running man)
They say welcome home I'm in the motherland (I'm home now)
Who do you love? Who do you love? (Who you love)
Know what it is, not what it was
Momma say I'm out of my mind, oh well
I saw Black Panther five times, oh well
Heartbreak basement
Drive me crazy
What have you done for me lately?

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
I feel like myself (nobody else)
I kiss I might tell (I might, I might)
You mad wait, oh well
Ya, ya oh well
Ya, ya oh well
Ya, ya oh well

[Verse 2: Makwa Beats]
I got Movite, phuz' amandla
Ntwana bong' uya spana
K'dala ngikhona, phusha phanda
Indlala yona ngiyayisaba
Nami ng'funa ibhande le Gucci
Haters talk but never do shit
Kicking bitches out the group crib
I'm in African and I'm a cool kid
Manje seng'ngazana no Sliqe
Ne cup lam' liqgwele u-muthi
I'm just a guy who grew up too quick
K'dala ngisebenzisa i-Frooty

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
I feel like myself (nobody else)
I kiss I might tell (I might, I might)
You mad wait, oh well
Ya, ya oh well
Ya, ya oh well
Ya, ya oh well

[Verse 3: AKA]
Ya'll dig like Shabba man
Shake the lala land
You could find me with the other niggas
That's a summer jam (HOT)
U-Maaka, you ain't got beats from Makwa
I do the money dance
Get the cheese from the government like Arthur
Say my name, say my name
Make sure it taste like achaar
Benylin, Fanta Grape
I take a shot with the youngsters
Private plane that's ganja
Robben Island paper that's Tata
Why you smoking that kaka?
Why you ain't reach out to AKA?
Lemonade, Lemonade
Watermelon, Profit
Go Dj, go Dj
Sync out the record to rockets
New hoes from Sumo
Looking for Johnson & Johnson
Hand in the jar, cookie monster
Now you long face Rich Forester

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
I feel like myself (nobody else)
I kiss I might tell (I might, I might)
You mad wait, oh well
Ya, ya oh well
Ya, ya oh well
Ya, ya oh well
