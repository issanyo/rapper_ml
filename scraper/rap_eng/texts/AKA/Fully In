[Verse 1]
Pardon me for the drama
I put niggas through trauma
Couldn’t penetrate the armour
Now they drinking sugar water
Death or dishonour
Head shots to this on
I can’t stop when own a sweatshop
Sauna
Blood clot
Lawyers
Everybody gotta have a dream
I will probably get some diamond teeth
If I ever meet Ben Baller
TKZee family
Set up pipe with the foil
Halloween (trick or treat)
That's guaranteed Shibobo
We ain’t suppose to be on magazines
None of this shit is normal
Started jacking up for overseas
Pretty queen baby oil
Niggas gon be niggas, Bitches won’t be loyal
Contracts seven figures
Time piece like water!
Sexy ngiya-understand-a
I’m in the section
I’m flexing
You pay attention I pay my taxes
Bando, you hold the candle
Monna relaxa
My stature too international
You flying Mango
Your baggage goes to Cabanas
I'm at the Palace
Jacuzzi
She finna use me
Orange juice me
Groupee
Bad and Boujee
Lil Uzi confuse me
Take off my Gucci, take off my jewellery
And School me
I put this on my mama
Pussy niggas all up in ma face like balaclava
What’s a Rand to a Dollar?
Is you gon' dala watch you holla?

[Pre-Chorus]
Big boys, don’t cry
Try to walk in my shoe size, it’s too tight
Numbers don’t lie
Lightning, ganja, more fire

[Chorus]
Fully in, fully in
Fully in, fully in
Fully in, in the gym
Fully in, fully in
Bulletproof in a Benz
Philipp Plein, hundred M's
Out the roof, shoot to kill, Bheki Cele
I'm fucking bad
Body bags, body bags
Money bags, money bags
Fully in, fully in
Fully in, in the gym
Bulletproof in a Benz
Philipp Plein, hundred M's
Out the roof,shoot to kill, Bheki Cele, Bheki Cele

[Verse 2]
Say my name or write it down
Sunday morning [?]
How many commas in my account?
I walk in the Louis and buy it out
I told my mama I will buy a house
I guess I’m the father figure now
You Mickey Mouse, in the clouds
Who's K now? Who's Jigga now?
'Cause Reebok paid the big amount
They be lined up when the shit is out
Wassup with your boy? What's that shit about?
Monday to Monday, T-shirts are selling out
My niggas online, but you out of data huh?
This ain't no regular cut, I'm rocking Virgil Abloh
Niggas finna get the [?], pull up on Marylin Monroe
Niggas asking where your hands at, Phillip Ndou
My closet full of couture, your closet full of manure
In the club tryna make peace, Crystal for my enemies
2018 that's a lame beat
When you focus all of your energy on the basics
Salaries, payslips
You ain't shit without family
They gon' hold you down like gravity
Spaceship, eagle eye
Doors up like butterfly
Patience, all my dogs stunt, 101 Dalmatians
Black and white, keep an open mind
Harry Oppenheimer, that's paper
They've been doing it from wayza
With the born free masons
I Stellenbosch with the laces
Eyes closed shooting free throws like the Lakers

[Refrain]
Swish, swish, swish, 2 points
Swish, swish, swish, 3 points, oh boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Big boys, don’t cry
Try to walk in my shoe size, it’s too tight
Numbers don’t lie
Lightning, ganja, more fire

[Chorus]
Fully in, fully in
Fully in, fully in
Fully in, in the gym
Fully in, fully in
Bulletproof in a Benz
Philipp Plein, hundred M's
Out the roof, shoot to kill, Bheki Cele
I'm fucking bad
Body bags, body bags
Money bags, money bags
Fully in, fully in
Fully in, in the gym
Bulletproof in a Benz
Philipp Plein, hundred M's
Out the roof, shoot to kill, Bheki Cele, Bheki Cele
