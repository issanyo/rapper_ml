[Verse 1: Guilty]

In this world you open doors you'll be locked till forever
You can't get away if you ever displeasure the oppressor
Stuck in my own creations, find my wings like Daedalus
Data-less traitorous ruler above the maze and thats
The one the people didn't choose And its amazing that
The gods can go wrong and get away Praising rats
That they assigned, cover his mind with a shining metal hat
I guess the one who always makes it is the maniac
My homie knows god, we tie ties with the highest
So bright eyesight blinded fly like icarus 
High rise of the waves and the lies on this island
I been fighting with the lines laid down by the tyrant
Started a riot, stopped hiding, breaking the silence
Now im conformed with in these walls stuck with nothing but science
Nothing but darkness and the fear of getting erased by the giant
Feeling like im deceived, like wine-dining a siren
Got the world on my shoulders, like Atlas the titan
The ruler ruling these streets has at last decided
The gap within the divided society has just widened
How did i wind up here, future ain't clear but regardless

[Verse 2: Guilty]

Im lost in this riddles tryna reach my catharsis
Down here in this darkness you can't tell what the time is
But im grateful for every second, the chances I haven’t taken
Make mistakes when stakes too high and you’ll forever be forsaken
Taking the time to master all these sacred creations
Pay so much attention to detail, I lengthened my sentence
If the machine is working don’t mess with the engine
The sedatives are taken just to synthesize a deception
I might be wrong but according to my calculations
If we work in accord we’ll pass these trials and tribulations
Oversee the pain and make use of our potential
Sensing the scent of defeat hear the sound from the running feet
Putting feathers together because I reckon we’ll fly
Don’t go too close to the ground but don’t keep your mind In the sky
The higher you’ll get I guess the longer you’ll fall and
Don’t ever get drawn in to the feeling of being all in

[Verse 3:AKA]

Stare down at the floor
As we’re moving through the pattern ways
Confused look through time
And remember where the caverns shake
Perpetuating images of clandestine paperweights
No one could know about this creation – make no mistake
You will come to see when truth decays
He crumbled down
And fell from heat –craftsmanship could ‘a save the day
He strays far from ground
All he could see was fruits in decay
Pushed out walls of the sound
He’s confused in array
My mind’s adrift in exodus, the fate of life – relinquishes
What once we loved in decadence
Was killed and writ in penmanship
You now know life – it’s featherless
Don’t mention shit, his excellence
He twists and turns benevolence
His schizophrenic sentiment
Greed and fear took precedence
A tune sung by the resident
A cry of death in development
Leaves scars of an emphasis
That what came from my hands - had turned, to a curse bestowed on me - through his relentless urge
A deal with the devil is deal done wrong
Convoluted thoughts, smoked up my mind to napalm
When you shake hands you don’t know what you did
Till you wake up stranded on Icaria with a pair wings
Told to fly a god, my sky’s a mirage
