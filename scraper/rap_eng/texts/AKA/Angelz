[Chorus: Anatii]
Don’t you know the devil started out as an angel?
Talking loud, busy walking around with a halo
You can't pull up to the Pearly Gates with the Range Rover
Last Supper make a reservation for a table

[Post-Chorus: AKA]
Ego!
That’s the root of all evil
Either I could ball or I could hire more people
They said you gon’ fall
Is it my fault not every man is born equal?
(That’s perfect)
Yah

[Verse 2: AKA]
Man, fuck a lazy promoter
We should be checking for culture vultures with shady personas
We should be saying “Ya’ll the reason they paying me a bonus”
Instead of saying “Can y’all go ahead and take me a photo”
What’s the game plan?
I’m a made man
If you ain’t fam?
Don’t go reaching for the bottle with your lame ass
It’s a train smash
But I don’t wanna act like I’m from the Cape flats (nah)
So bounce ASAP
You ain’t telling lies you be telling double stories
Dollar signs got my whole design dripping saucy
It’s been a long time since I bought a kick at Sportscene
Sunday morning it’s a vibe, Wilson B. Nkosi
(Let’s go)
6-by-9, for the brand new (ishu)
Slide it by for the hommie (yah)
It’s a vibe, for the chart
Five fire flame emoji

[Chorus: Anatii]
Don’t you know the devil started out as an angel?
Talking loud, busy walking around with a halo
You can't pull up to the Pearly Gates with the Range Rover
Last supper make a reservation for a table

[Post-Chorus: AKA]
Ego!
That’s the root of all evil
Either I could ball or I could hire more people
They said you gon’ fall
Is it my fault not every man is born equal?
(That’s perfect)
Yah

[Bridge: Anatii]
Masambe, masambe, masambe siye eMonti (Monti)
Masambe siye eMonti! (Monti)
Masambe siye eMonti! (Monti)
Ubambe, bambe, bambe ntoni? (ntoni?)
Ubambe ntoni? (ntoni?)
Upush' ubhaka, ubhak' weskolo

[Verse 2: Anatii]
Heyi mani uthini na lo?
When I pull in that Porsche?
Damn, saddle up my nigga
Let's settle the score
Aye, bring out the horse (aye)
I got a voice (hey)
It opened doors (hey)
Pass me the aux
Only nigga flowing fana ka lo
Still at mama crib and still doing chores
Got the Midas touch man I got the gold
Guarding on me just to seek of the fall
Yeah, ba no mona
It’s not my fault
Touch of a wall
They run for rewards
They fuck with the fame thing
Why, why we maintain
Down with the gang, gang
Down with the gang, gang
(They wildin')
But the phone don’t ring
But the phone don’t ring
(They dialling)
But the phone don’t ring
But the phone don’t ring
A nigga be banked up
A nigga be ganged up
I hope you prayed up
Don’t come with the same stuff
Why they tell on me? Why they tell on me?
Why they tell on me? Why they tell on me?

[Chorus: Anatii]
Don’t you know the devil started out as an angel
Talking loud, busy walking around with a halo
You can't pull up to the Pearly Gates with the Range Rover
Last supper make a reservation for a table

[Post-Chorus: AKA]
Hallelujah! Say something
In the kitchen cooking with the apron
Bread winner, bring home the bagels
It's bad women on my taste buds

[Outro: Anatii]
Masambe, masambe, masambe siye eMonti (Monti)
Masambe siye eMonti! (Monti)
Masambe siye eMonti! (Monti)
Ubambe, bambe, bambe ntoni? (ntoni?)
Ubambe ntoni? (ntoni?)
Upush' ubhaka, ubhak' weskolo
