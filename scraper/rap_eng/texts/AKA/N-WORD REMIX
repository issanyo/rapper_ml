And its don jazzy again

[Verse 1: Ice Prince]
Jazzy, I’m feeling great I’m feeling nice G
I’m shooting at the stars my trigger Spike Lee
I step inside the room your chick is like geez
She knows her underground ain’t
Nothing to them ice’s G
Jesus these niggas ain’t in my category
I’m topping the lead and couple of gig is
Giving them niggas amnesias
I upping the beat one hundred degrees
I’m giving the niggas the seizure
I kill every verse and i kill every rapper
That happens to be in the future

[Verse 2: Ice Prince]
I’m heading to the top they say its
Illuminati
I’m hanging in your city in a new
Buggatti

The main street

Drop a bomb like I’m Saddam, you ronald
Raegan Bo ye
Think out the box we’re unstoppable
For you to jab you need to know that its
Possible
I’m at the airport, in my air force
Fuck the world put her legs by the head
Board

Broccoli
Hard to get ahead in this dollar based
Economy
In the flag we pledge third world
Psychology
Now follow me while I follow dreams
