[Verse 1]
Thought if I ignored it
It would fade away
Thought that it would be sorted
If I didn't stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Thought if I numbed it all
I wouldn't have to face it
But guess what...
The more you hide
The more it breaks you

[Chorus]
But it just got harder to move
When the walls came in
There was no excuse
I was so far from the truth
You knew me better
Than I knew you

[Chorus 2]
And I fell apart
Fell apart
Fell apart right there
And you saw my heart
Saw my heart
You saw my heart bare

[Verse 2]
Told myself it wouldn't hurt
If I just stayed hollow
