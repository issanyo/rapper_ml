[Hook: AKA]
I know, I know we just saved the day
Superhero I'm gon' need a speedo and a cape
X-ray vision through your evil ways
Tell your people don't forget to pray

[Chorus: Anatii]
Don't forget to pray, ewe
Do you know that God is on the way?
Ewe, ewe
Don't forget to pray, yea yeah
Do you know that God is on the way?
Ewe

[Verse 1: Da Roking Guy]
Drg the boss
Young nigga withe the floss
Gotta win at all cost
Ice cold like frost
Puffing kush with the mask
Lean in my cup please don't ask
Young nigga hot like a flask
Young nigga hot like a flask
Sjava pulled up in a vura
My bodies pulled up with the cooler
I am straight like a ruler
Still hitting em licks for the moola
Family turned they back on me
Then I knew shit was real
Didn't know how to feel
Almost made me pop a seal
Don't forget the Ncika, ewe
Do you know the GOATs are on the way
(Lean, lean, lean, lean)
Don't forget the Doom, ewe
Do you know the GOATs are on the way
Ewe, ewe
Okay check
Young nigga trapping too hard
Played the girl like a card
Did my shit then I got it
Got in that bitch yeah
Hitting them licks
Getting them sticks
(sticks, sticks, Sticks)
Getting them bricks
Young nigga from the east
(Drg)

Do you know that God is on the way?
Ewe, ewe
Don't forget to pray, yea yeah
