[Intro: AKA]
Broadcast live from RawX, ya bitch (Where you dey?)
Ya bitch! (Okay okay)

[Hook: AKA]
Pull up at the party and I'm sitting sideways
Dreams so big bout to get a migraine
Niggas all in my face; Twitter, MySpace
Party like a cowboy, yipikayay!
I took another shot
Let my pupils dilate, let the speakers vibrate
Rappers on the shelf, reached your sell by date
Take a double L for yourself Cool J
Niggas saying my name, riding my wave
Let the money sky scrape, never mind hate
Let the speakers vibrate

[Verse2: Reason]
Running my lane, get the fuck out my way
GaaAHD body got the party singing my praise
In a bad place since I lost the wifey
Now I'm tryna find a Kim K like I'm Kanye
Had a good woman now I need a bad bae
On that good good you should quit the bad hate
Money on my mind in my memory bank
You should see my cheeky eyes underneath the Ray Bans
Aye, motherfucker I'm great
That's why you take shots and never send them my way Madabeesh!
Fuck am I sayin'?
Judging by this verse I would do the same thing

[Verse 3: Khuli Chana]
Yipikayay, yipiyaya yay
Kim K B-A-C-K, fuck out my way
Been a dead case, still lakha at what did I say
Modumo ke tshela thupa, mokalangwane
Ke sa tswetswe van toeka, feel like a new Khulani
Motherfuckers ain't shit change, Khuli o monate
Grew up a balabala, I do it my way
Holla phalafala in my new driveway
Following in a gusheshe with personalised pace
Pusha, phanda personified, majita might hate
The throne is mine I'm way ahead of the game
Leave em with a "I just ate a humble pie" face

[Outro: Reason]
Everybody in this place say:
PH make the speakers vibrate (vibrate) He make the speakers vibrate
Khuli Chana make the speakers vibrate (vibrate) He make the speakers vibrate
Kiernan Forbes make the speakers vibrate (vibrate) He make the speakers vibrate
GaaAHD body make the speakers vibrate (vibrate) He make the speakers vibrate(vibrate)
(pull up!) Kuyafiwa

Ayo, ayo! (x12)

I took another shot
Let my pupils dilate, let the speakers vibrate
