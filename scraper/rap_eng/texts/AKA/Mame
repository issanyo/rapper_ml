JR (Chorus)

Hey Mame, Mame, Mame
Gulula cause we do this every day
Hey Mame, Mame, Mame
I don't believe in they promises
I just talk my shit and Sing sing my heart away
Every time we link up Chardonnay
??? Bring your drinks up!!
Celebrate my people
Just look how far we've come
Siyamkhumbula Jacob Zuma Thabo Mbeki
FW De Klerk?? NO WAY!
Hey Mame, Mame, Mame
Hey Mame, Mame, Mame
Hey Mame, Mame, Mame
Hey Mame, Mame, Mame

Verse 1 (AKA)
Shoot first no question
Set fire to the necklace
Rubber band!
I'm a terrorist? I'm the president!!
Sika le khekhe if I bless her
Cut it up like Codesa!!
They gone feel like it's 2010
Vuvuzela, Success!!
That shit taste nothing like Fresca
Everybody under pressure
I'm in the mix like Dudezane
Spicy Korobela!
Magic
In the pot tryna Rise like tastic
Focus on the goal like I'm Joel Stransky
Bout to hit the road like???
Sexy
Barbalicious on a Wednesday!
All freeze on the rampage
World reach for the campaign
It's bout to be a revolution
Dooms day
Fuck what you read in the newspaper
You should????

JR (Chorus)

Hey Mame, Mame, Mame

Verse 2 (AKA)
I feel like we on the edge
Do you want freedom or do you want a Bimmer?
Even Madiba pulled up in a Benz
None of you leaders resonate with the kids
Julius people taking revenge
Stashing your cheese up instead of the fridge

I ain't talking adidas I'm talking balance
I'm talking mkhindo we Sizwe, I'm talking defense
Linda Buthelezi, Mercedes Benz
They got the brands we got the power
I pull up with racks duffle bag msawawa

That's what the young ones really care bout
Popping watermelon living hand to mouth
We be on the level stand on a couch
Cause ain't no body took the time to sit us down
We talking out!
BOUNCE, BOUNCE BITCH BOUNCE, BOUNCE!!

So what if Ubaba bought a big house!
10 years on an island for your big mouth or Suffer in silence
This is our time
Pull an i8 and X6 out
What now?
Lunch time gravy
Fuck you!!
Pay me!!

JR (Chorus)

Hey Mame, Mame, Mame
Gulula cause we do this every day
Hey Mame, Mame, Mame
I don't believe in they promises
I just talk my shit and Sing sing my heart away

Siyamkhumbula Jacob Zuma Thabo Mbeki
FW De Klerk?? NO WAY!
Hey Mame, Mame, Mame
