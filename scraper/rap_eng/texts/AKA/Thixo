[Pre-Hook: AKA]
I be sipping all night
Your bitch in my section, you gon' see the starlight
Why you under pressure?
Too over protective, she gon' love me long time
Don't you see the necklace?
It's a different texture
Now I'm gon' need protection, for all the private dances

[Hook: Yanga]
Thixo
Ngicela ung'size ungang'thathi ngisas' eskhaleni
Hayi kum'nandi uk'jaiva
Siyalwa siya provida

[Verse 1: L-Tido]
I been sipping all night, kicks is all white
Wrist is all bright and my fucking drinks is all nice
And your chick is in my section acting friendly
She ain't an option but she could fit my plan B
No question man, my name is where the truth is
Walked through the fire bitch and still come out the coolest
All y'all niggas minute maid, she asking where the juice is?
I'm in a convertible, she asking where the roof is?
I made it from nothing to something, no excuses
Hustle hard, pulled a couple of strings like acoustics
Started a label now my hand on another pie
Yeah we taking shit up to another night
It's motherfuck them all, I don't see a hater
Ran the city so much, I could be a mayor
Yeah I'm making dough, I don't need a baker
Pockets got notes, like Anita Baker

Tell me who got the minerals, huh?
Me and my brother been at the top for a minute now
The shit I'm smoking is pretty loud
But don't say my car topless, no, no, the titties' out
North God got the answers
Put your hand up
That you shoot with, count your loot with
If you in the way, you gon' have to move bitch
I don't buy face, I ain't gotta prove shit
'Cause I got a better plug, smoking my indo
Top floor, The Pepper Club
The special cloth talk, passports, et cetera
I'm on a world tour, long haul, America
I'm finna count bread and paint the town red like a Ferrari
Unlimited options every time we go shopping
Joshua outdoor, niggas be smoking John shit
Roll up the Selassie not the Bongani Fassie
People say a lot shit about me, about me
Every season, what's the reason they can do without me?
Damn, even your man need a selfie
Handsome and wealthy
Bank balance healthy

Come roll with me baby girl, I got you for life
Matter fact, mmm, mmm, I got you tonight
This fame shit can make you fell out of your mind
The sex became easy to get, love harder to find
Since I lost the girl I love, I been a savage
No commitments chicks can't even get a beverage
How you acting all conceited when you average
You need to pick a struggle, you don't meet my standards
My circle small, had to tighten up a few ends
In 0'17 hate's become the new trend
They tryna kill me ntwana, hoping that my juice end
But only way I could be murked? Is in that new Benz
Ngeke balunge, 16V ke le para
Gomora on my back, RIP that nigga Flabba
Yeah I'm living everyday like it's my last
No regrets, man I've lived it up to the max
