[Intro: K.O]
The only thing important to me is pushing the game forward
The boy getting that pussy for free, the blessers can pay for it

[Verse 1: K.O]
Way back, way back in the day boy
Man all that I wanted was to be famous for a living
For me to get away eLokishini, go and make it in the city
I played Monopoly, played with action figures
Now the game is our monopoly, we play with actual figures
You can lose a lot of paper chasing women, just know
But all that pussy soon as you get your paper is a given
See a bad bitch gets dick, a young Uber X trip
Some Mango Air tickets and that’s it
The reason for my loot love
Ntwana, the chicks scream when I pull up
Whenever they see me in my new truck
Looking like I had it shipped in from the future
The Cashtime president been getting that Gupta
And I’m never going broke, no more
I’m a Jack of all trades, I’m a virtuoso
You don’t know it
I knew they would give me all my respect in due time
Had to put these bars in their faces and let them do time (K-Eezo)

[Hook: K.O]
Oh, oh
Okay, kay
Players on my team, everybody on their A-game
I’m a young 16V in his heyday
Vele vele been that nigga since way way
Bang out (x5)
Jump out the uber at the crib and pull the bands out
I’m the man, okay kay
Kick off the J’s and pull the Vans out
Okay, kay

[Verse 2: Nasty C]
Love and money, I place them apart
I started hitting stages, I broke a leg and a heart
Y’all need a real motherfucker and I’m great for the part
Cause I bumped into hip hop when she had her legs apart
Would you look at what they made you think
Who could make me flinch?
Walking through the jungle and stepped into some amazing shit
My presence alone is just a high
(Ha, made you blink)
I was tryna sail the ship and fucked around and saved the ship
My brother told me:
“Work for anything but that engagement ring”
Trust me you gon’ hate that shit
And now I’m living life in a ring
It’s either make a hit or take a hit
I fucked around a raised a generation of these anuses
Now ain’t that a bitch?
They should’ve told you stay off Twitter
Cause lately it’s just been looking like I paid off Slikour
If you expecting me to fall, hold your breath, cross fingers
Bitch, your favourite rapper’s either dead or a witness
And if I said it, I meant it

[Hook: K.O]
Oh, oh
Okay, kay
Players on my team, everybody on their A-game
I’m a young 16V in his heyday
Vele vele been that nigga since way way
Bang out (x5)
Jump out the uber at the crib and pull the bands out
I’m the man, okay kay
Kick off the J’s and pull the Vans out
Okay, kay

[Verse 3: AKA]
Supa Mega got a lot of presence
Told myself I was a legend since an adolescent
Learned my lesson, yeah the message is a tad aggresive
Now every new nigga need a blessing from the rap god
I developed back problems
That’s what happens when you have to carry niggas that long
Pussy nigga wish I would diss you to give you a platform
You need to politic less and rap more
Please remember I come from the era of ‘The Clap Song’
Now every second record is a trap song
Shit is cold but the throne keep my ass warm
When I drop, game over like a blackball
No subliminal jabs
If I see you I guarantee you they gon’ witness a criminal act
I think I reached my potential too fast
I hope this beat got a Kaizer Chiefs funeral plan
Man, I take a sip of that styrofoam
I smoke a zip on that flight mode
I’m in a different time zone
Daddy cool, 22, Michelin tyres on
Bang out (x3), I’m a savage
I’m the one who put the city on the atlas
Supa Mega, I’m established
Bout to send a uber to your address
