I pick up the phone when the money is callin’, HELLO!
I twist up the buda and pray in da mornin’, HELLO!
I pick up the phone when your honey is callin’, HELLO!
I hustle, I hustle, success is my callin’, HELLO!
HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!
HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!
HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!
HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!
HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!

[Verse 1: Laylizzy]
The world is callin’ for Laylizzy
Everybody want him like a Yeezy
The summer callin’ for a Jeep
I might just cop it for my Niggas
Invest my vision on a microphone I might go broke
But fuck it! Pledge allegiance
Got Monalisas on a Limo, rappers go bald when they hear me like KIMO!
Tjovitjo! I’m old school with it
Niggas steady trippin’ like, shit, how the fuck he did it
Qual é a cena, qual é a cena
Quando a malta ta no club é tipo OLA! Qualé a Drena
I heard some niggas think I’m cheesy
I got that Cheese I guess I’m cheesy
I got the steeze, Ellputo got the beats
The whole world is gon’ wanna hop on the reeemix

I pick up the phone when the money is callin’, HELLO!
I twist up the buda and pray in da mornin’, HELLO!
I pick up the phone when your honey is callin’, HELLO!
I hustle, I hustle, success is my callin’, HELLO!
HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!
HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!
HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!
HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!
HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!

[Verse 2:  AKA]
I done paid my dues
Swagg is well adjusted
I don’t make the rules, babe
I jus push the buttons
Customs well accustomed
I’ve seen too many Noni Gasa’s
Bitch, I’ve been around the world
Still, Mi Casa es su casa
She get lonely at the top
All my squad is tried to trust it
Don’t take much to cut you off
My old dog jus kicked the bucket
Now we posted in the north
I don’t listen to the gossip
I got trophies on the wall
And designer in the closet

[Hook]
I pick up the phone when the money is callin’, HELLO!
I twist up the buda and pray in da mornin’, HELLO!
I pick up the phone when your honey is callin’, HELLO!
I hustle, I hustle, success is my callin’, HELLO!
HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!
HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!
HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!
HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!
HELLO! HELLO! HELLO!

[Bridge]
The money is callin’
Pick up the phone
Pick up the phone
The money is callin’
Pick up the phone
The money is callin’
Pick up the phone
HELLO!
