[Intro: AKA]
I swear to God
That's how we made this
Yeah

[Verse 1: AKA]
I'm in a league of my own
I'm in the zone
I got the portion
My niggas is fucking these hoes
But you can't fuck with their focus
Ain't it funny how the people that hurt you the most is standing the closest
Lately I've been going through some changes, I ain't ready to process
I'm the coolest in the city
I got you standing near me
They tryna dab me up to show me love
I don't feel it
We was doing missions
We was pulling bitches in the civic
Fuck were you when I was breaking through
Barely made enough to make a living
Come take a seat in my living room
Come take a peek at a better view
If you taking aim, you better shoot
I got more trophies than tennis shoes
You experts
With your guess work
Talk a whole lotta number 2
You got a thirst for forbidden fruit
Family first that's the golden rule

[Hook: Ma-E & AKA]
If I didn't make it in this rap
Beng zoba yini
Cash all these cheques
Bozo nqoma yini
My swag wasn't fresh
Bozo bona yini
Roll with me (x2)

[Chorus: AKA & Ma-E]
Don't lie 2 me (don't lie 2 me)
Bozo nthanda yini (bozo nthanda nini)
Don't lie 2 me (don't lie 2 me)
Bozo nthanda yini

[Verse 2: Ma-E]

Remember when I couldn't pay the bill
Eish bang'hlatswisa dikotlolo

Hay' kabi, is the password to my WIFI
She turned around gave me a high5
You really living that high life
She's loving the lifestyle
I think she my type
She only gets high, maka nam
Athi kumnandi maka nam'
Sibaland' izolo nges'lahla

[Bridge: AKA]
Way too many bitches acting suspect
Way too many niggas at the club I hold a grudge with
Me and my click we on some thick as night shit
Bust your lip when they get sick of twitter thug shit

[Bridge: Ma-E]
When you ain't talking money, as'mamel'
Ma'ngena mali, abak'fatel'
Kwamel' uvuk' emacandeni
Get out of the shell (x2)
They want you to fail
Get out of the jail (x2)

[Chorus: AKA & Ma-E]
Don't lie 2 me (don't lie 2 me)
Bozo nthanda yini (bozo nthanda nini)
Don't lie 2 me (don't lie 2 me)
Bozo nthanda yini
