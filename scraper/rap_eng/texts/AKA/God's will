[Verse one: AKA]
Lord give me solid gold
Give me endless knowledge and wisdom
Friend or foe? How do we go?
Who knows the difference?
Madiba notes, designer clothes, we on a mission
I’m on the road to riches
You on patrol for bitches
So control your ho, we step in the building
I turned it from a broken home into a family business
Coca Cola Dome went toe-to-toe with Grammy winners
Now there ain’t no brand proposal that don’t have me in it
We winnin’, survival of the fittest
I pray the bible guide me to the finish
Stack the paper higher by the minute
When it comes to desire, they say the sky is the limit
When it comes to lines of design, messiah image
Big dreams, tunnel vision is pristine
Analyse the paradigm shift to six feet
Now realise life is a chip so dig deep
This is God’s will ’till I’m buried in six feet

[Chorus: KO]
Life as a leader (a leader)
Some people wanna bury you
But if you a believer (believer)
Baba, your faith will carry you
Yehlis’umoya, ‘hlis’umoya, ‘hlis’umoya
Bade this is God’s will, nothing you can do about it
Yehlis’umoya, ‘hlis’umoya, ‘hlis’umoya
Budde this is God’s doing, and you can’t do nothing about it

[Verse two: KO]
Why you mad at me? It’s my time to blow
I’d like to know why i-life i-so
It’s my destiny, they try fight it though
My type of flow on the mic like a pro
You can’t fill my shoes o-size my babo
Nothing you can do on this mic that I ain’t done already
‘zob’omunye wale zi’naai that I wanna bury’
Never met a chick in my life that I wanna marry
From rags to riches that’s my itinerary
Cash-flow so perfect – heavy current
See I even got your ho surfing
I’m busy googling myself, you know soul-searching
If money talks, Nelson Mandela is my spokesperson
As we fight for survival and as we fight for the title
I am never scared I look straight into the eyes of a rival
On the mic I’m a psycho and I write what I like so
I’m here dropping verses like I’m reciting the bible
I am better than ever before true hard work
I draw my weapon and leave them in all true art work
You can’t stop my shine, I’m the naked truth
In my birthday suit by God’s design
I get my hustle on mfanakithi that’s right
And if you talking more money, baba let’s ride
And I told you before I’m part of the best five
Bath’u-K.O is’khothane sale-rap, right

[Chorus]
