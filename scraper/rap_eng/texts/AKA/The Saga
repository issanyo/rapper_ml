[Intro: Anatii]
These niggas ain’t down to earth they better come back down
Heard they be taking shots need more rounds
Down with the Rands and Nairas tryna lose pounds
Yeah I’ll be in the gym, working out

[Chorus: Anatii]
Gettin’ turned up on a Sunday
'Cause I’m gettin’ more money on Monday, haa
I take these girls out on Tuesday
And I buy 'em champagne like it’s Kool-Aid, huh
Barbiliscious on Wednesday
Paper cuts so I think I need a band-aid
I’m with my niggas Thursday I’m in the bando
Friday, car wash I’m in the Benzo

[Verse 1: Anatii]
Lost a lot of weight just to fit in Balmain
Now I got a new car, new chain
Bought a new grill with the diamonds and they bling
Shout out to Saint Laurent, he’s a saint
Jay 'bout to leave the Porsche he 'bout to bring the plane
Yeah I’ma bring the bars, bring the pain
Lom’ntwan untlwaela blind she lift her bra and her thang
Now I’m 'bout to see my girl and her friends
Sexy Chubby, Supa Mega so you best get out the way
Boys in trucks, huh - G63
I took this girl out on a school day
And I drop her ass off at UJ

[Chorus: Anatii]
Gettin’ turned up on a Sunday
'cause I’m gettin’ more money on Monday, haa
I take these girls out on Tuesday
And I buy 'em champagne like it’s Kool-Aid, huh
Barbiliscious on Wednesday
Paper cuts so I think I need a band-aid
I’m with my niggas Thursday I’m in the bando
Friday, car wash I’m in the Benzo

[Verse 2: AKA]
Always had the dream that I would be the Supa Mega
On my second album but they treat me like a legend
Listen to my old shit, that’s my only pressure
City where the gold is that’s the Holy Mecca
You can get the money, you can never buy taste
Take a sip of my name split the side grave
Niggas talking beef shit wanna braai vleis
Why you smoking cheap shit, this is high grade
I think this mami got potential
I think this molly got me bustin’ out the friend zone
Drop in the champagne like a Mentos
We in the lobby but your body is a temple

[Chorus: Anatii]
Gettin’ turned up on a Sunday
'cause I’m gettin’ more money on Monday, haa
I take these girls out on Tuesday
And I buy 'em champagne like it’s Kool-Aid, huh
Barbiliscious on Wednesday
Paper cuts so I think I need a band-aid
I’m with my niggas Thursday I’m in the bando
Friday, car wash I’m in the Benzo

[Verse 3: Anatii]
Ang'buy iskelem' man I buy things
It's not my fault that these rappers bayizing
The Thundercat back brought the lightning
But now these niggas mad cause these hoes selling pipe dreams
I’m treating habits like a spaza
You prolly thought I got this money from my father
R.I.P to Tata
Shall we continue with the saga
Thousand dollar jeans and balaclavas

[Verse 4: AKA]
You know this shit is a classic
This ain’t no Billabong - no regular fabric
This is a Megathon now build me a statue
My nigga I been a god don’t let this shit gas you
Sim Dope pull up in a coupe with the Porsche sign
Pop these bottles off the roof at the All White
Drop these models in the pool, one me there’s a lot of you
Time to show you how they do it in the North Side

[Chorus: Anatii]
Gettin’ turned up on a Sunday
'Cause I’m gettin’ more money on Monday, haa
I take these girls out on Tuesday
And I buy 'em champagne like it’s Kool-Aid, huh
Barbiliscious on Wednesday
Paper cuts so I think I need a band-aid
I’m with my niggas Thursday I’m in the bando
Friday, car wash I’m in the Benzo

[Outro: Anatii]
These niggas ain’t down to earth they better come back down
Heard they be taking shots need more rounds
Down with the Rands and Nairas, tryna lose pounds
Yeah I’ll be in the gym, working out
