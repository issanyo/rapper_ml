[Chorus: AKA]
We got trophies, gold medal
As we proceed to GOAT level
Revenge so sweet
Now my whole team count their blessings
Pope level

[Post-Chorus: AKA]
It's all in your mind
Just keep your eye on the prize

[Refrain: Anatii]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa

[Bridge: AKA]
I'm just living my life
Only the strong will survive

[Verse 1: AKA]
I used to want the title as a freshman
Now all of my biggest idols are my best friends
Every instrumental got a death wish
Took my niggas out the ghetto like the Fresh Prince
Being doing the best since a fresh prince
Now I'm making solid investments
Beam Group don't fall, I hope fees do
I'm rocking Jordans
I pull up in a foreign when I pick my daughter up from pre-school
Y'all beginners already got me feeling I'm a father figure
I got some relatives who treat me like a lotto ticket
A lot of niggas can't handle the way I handle business
They getting touched like pianos but my standards will live in
Season after season I done won awards
Lately I've been feeling an underdog

[Chorus: AKA]
We got trophies, gold medal
As we proceed to GOAT level
Revenge so sweet
Now my whole team count their blessings
Pope level

[Post-Chorus: AKA]
It's all in your mind
Just keep your eye on the prize

[Refrain: Anatii]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa

[Bridge: AKA]
I'm just living my life
Only the strong will survive

[Verse 2: AKA]
Tell me what it takes to be the big boss
Put the pieces all together like a jigsaw
I'm on a different level I don't think small
I remember when my mama had the Clicks card
DStv decoder getting switched off
Can't even get my SuperSport Blitz on
When I left baby mama she took the shit hard
Might as well turn the drama into a hit song
Composure, composure that ain't a diss song
As we continue the saga and move the shit forward
Figure way out the box with this one
Lonely when you been at the top for this long

[Chorus: AKA]
We got trophies, gold medal
As we proceed to GOAT level
Revenge so sweet
Now my whole team count their blessings
Pope level

[Post-Chorus: AKA]
It's all in your mind
Just keep your eye on the prize

[Interlude: Anatii]
It's about time you listen Boom Shaka
It's about time you listen Boom Shaka
Shaka Boom, Shaka Boom, Shaka Boom, Shaka
Shaka Boom, Shaka Boom, Shaka Boom, Shaka
Shaka Boom, Shaka Boom, Boom, Boom
Boom, Boom, Boom
Shaka Boom, Shaka Boom, Shaka Boom, Shaka
Shaka Boom, Shaka Boom, Shaka Boom, Shaka
Shaka Boom, Shaka Boom, Boom, Boom
Boom, Boom, Boom

[Outro: AKA]
I'm just living my life
Only the strong will survive
