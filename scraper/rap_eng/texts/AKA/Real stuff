[Hook: AKA]
I been in the dungeon cooking up the real stuff
Stacking 50’s and 100’s, they gon’ think I deal drugs
Two cups with the ammo, check my new collabo
North god got the whole squad dressed in camo’
Shoutout to the fam-o, that’s that real love
Bitches name dropping and the topic’s still us
Focus on the profit, now my pocket Big Nuz
Started from the bottom, they gon’ have to kill us
Kill us, cause we some real ones
Some real ones
Yeah, ah we some real ones
Some real ones

[Verse 1: AKA]
I’m that nigga sippin’ liquor blowing swisher in your face
When my fingers get the itching, I ain’t talking Twitter names
See you lames don’t get the picture, til I put you in a frame
I say “Mirror mirror, tell me who the realest in the game”
Tell the fuckin’ truth, you ain’t really what you say
You ain’t really got the juice, you ain’t got the Minute Maid
I’m the baddest on the planet, check the carats in my chain
But the fam is all that matters, fuck the cameras and the fame
I show you flames, accolades
My dude is Shaq, I’m number 8, we puffing mase
Your fans gon’ need their money back, the fact remains
They put me up there with the greats, I’m higher grade

[Verse 2: Da LES]
Fresh out of my safe, finger-rolling that guap
In 2008 I was jumping out of that drop
A lot of things done changed but I’m still calling the shots
Put it up in your face, that’s that Pineapple Ciroc
My whole squad going up right now
Popping bottles on a Sunday, fuck a club right now
Got your dream girl in your dream house
She clean up while I clean out
Chose fame over what nigga?
Survival over you fuck niggas

[Verse 3: Maggz]
Everyday I wake up
Gotta break up all this weed
Clouds are Jesus over me
Everyday I weight up all these odds upon a G
Gradually found my dream but lost my sleep
What it mean?
Angazi kuthi ku [?]
All I know is this life thing izok’ khiph’ inkane
Gotta focus when the right thing is veza mngane
Do shit, talk less about it
Move kings, be chess about it
That’s checkmate mfana ‘am
That’s a band-aid mfana ‘am
And that’s a different plateau, a different landscape mfana’ am’
Presidential but with no campaign mfana ‘am
While they’re whining, put your time in
And be the champagne mfana’ am
