[Bridge]

March to the war drum, resistance lunatic
Another world war savior with a stash` vodka and lubricants Infamous rifle bandit it- I think I used since birth
Land mines blown into human bodies through the fumes of work
Another roof remnant ready to crumble to the humid
Earth I've got enough heat in my glare to smoke the pews in church
Freeze-frame at the 10th step - left wondering who drew it first

[Chorus]
Blessed be the day I am embraced with my destiny
Drowned deep inside in inebriation and inequity
Drifting mentally to a place that the Gods have sent for me. Frantically moving through thoughts, engulfed in catastrophe [x2]

[Verse 1]

Ending up a hot mess, I’m left: to be continued
At the next venue, dilute structures before the courts get you Love is hurting who hurt, so for what it’s worth
I’ll show you what it’s like when love gets absurd
Nothing matters, Form isotopes of creation
Many made men end in trials that are set for their damnation, Get lost in it - it’s a ‘dumb-found-dead’ prophecy
Or In my words: it’s the resourcefulness of poverty
Locked my body mentally i’m at the pinnacle of gates
My mind’s converged - ready to erase
Whatever there is to deface
The walls are up, you can now enter to my maze
The physical depiction of a mind ablaze
Where you will find how a twisted mind confides the horrors that reside inside my phantom’s guise -
You can’t realize what it’s like to find
Something so evil you can’t recognize or creep at night
And I don’t need a knife to terrorize your whole belief in life

[Chorus]

Blessed be the day I am embraced with my destiny
Drowned deep inside in inebriation and inequity
Drifting mentally to a place that the Gods have sent for me. Frantically moving through thoughts, engulfed in catastrophe
[x2]

[Verse 2]
Maintain my order, walk through and turn the corners
Where every way looks different and concurrently distorted
A pathway left to discover is one that’s unsupported
My vengeance of repentance has brought -truth to conform with
My way of punishment - malnourishment at my command, Saw Megara, left her bald and punished those who took stand, Against their pride and sold their soul as second-hands
. The dark line is set in stone, i don’t need a helping hand
