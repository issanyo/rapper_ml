Hey!
One time for the Gold Diggers
One time for the blessers
One time for the old niggas spending bank roll when you need a lil extra
Spare a thought for my broke niggas
They be feeling that pressure  (Starlights)

Shit is kinda lit right now

Can she sing it with me?
"Na na na na na"
Oooooh can she sing it with me?
"Na na na na na"
Too busy running the streets?
"Na na na na na"
Oooooh she be leaving with me!
"Na na na na na"
