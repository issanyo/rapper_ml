[Chorus]
Lions in the jungle
Going in for the kill
Number five with the mambo
Then we sex and we chill
Niggas in the club better keep their distance
Oh it's finna go down for real
This is for my gintsas with their fist up
You gon' touch my blood for real
You gon' touch my blood for real
You gon' touch my blood for real
You gon' touch my blood for real
You gon' touch my blood for real

[Verse 1]
They told me to relax, I massage my own ego
Started me a band then clapped guitar hero
Brasa van die Kaap we're not from Mondeor
People from the south they bump (me) not Migos
I swim in the tank with sharks and not nemos
Evil people who act like Don Cheadle
I can smell a rat that Axe a strong deo'
How we get the banks and land from white people?
Zeros
Pre '94 I was laanie
Post '94, kwenzakalani?
Grand folks voted for the party
Even threw us in the garbage, Mmusi Maimane
Say that we're the next Zimbabwe
All I see is Zimbali from my suite in Dubane

[Chorus]
Lions in the jungle
Going in for the kill
Number five with the mambo
Then we sex and we chill
Niggas in the club better keep their distance
Oh it's finna go down for real
This is for my gintsas with their fist up
You gon' touch my blood for real
You gon' touch my blood for real
You gon' touch my blood for real
You gon' touch my blood for real
You gon' touch my blood for real

[Verse 2]
Young Forbes get the cheese
White boys finna freeze
Tracksuit in the boardroom
Hundred bands in the keys
Ever since I blew up, I feel like I'm 2Pac, they gon' give me group love like I'm Drew Hill
Sleeping in the bed with my current mami game and I'm thinking 'bout who I'm gon' text
Blue tick
Is you gon' get the new [?]
Ooh shame, who finna washa you lames?
I be gone in a minute, touch down with the bus down, the sky is the limit
From the start to the finish keep God in mind
And my dogs go to heaven

[Chorus]
Lions in the jungle
Going in for the kill
Number five with the mambo
Then we sex and we chill
Niggas in the club better keep their distance
Oh it's finna go down for real
This is for my gintsas with their fist up
You gon' touch my blood for real
You gon' touch my blood for real
You gon' touch my blood for real
You gon' touch my blood for real
You gon' touch my blood for real

[Verse 3]
Way before I got my Rands up
Teachers would tell me to pull my pants up
Parents evening was a disaster
Show me love, show me love
Been blowing up like Samsung
If I had the brush cut something like Samson
I was in the classroom dreaming up anthems
Now they see the tattoos then they get asthma
Tell me I'm handsome, tell me I'm cool
Tell me everybody else been old news
Tell me what's happening, what happened to the passion?
What happened to the soul food?
Everybody living with their nose down, caught up in their mobile
Tryna act brand new (shuu)
I guess a man gotta do what he gotta do

[Chorus]
Lions in the jungle
Going in for the kill
Number five with the mambo
Then we sex and we chill
Niggas in the club better keep their distance
Oh it's finna go down for real
This is for my gintsas with their fist up
You gon' touch my blood for real
You gon' touch my blood for real
You gon' touch my blood for real
You gon' touch my blood for real
You gon' touch my blood for real
