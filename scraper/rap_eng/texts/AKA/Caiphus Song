[Chorus]
Running outta things I could prove myself
Way too busy winning I'ma lose myself
Everyday they gon' hate on us
Mama said she gon' pray for us
'Cause I can't do it on my own
You're that girlie, special somebody I know
You beside me turn this house into a home
Give me one good reason why ungenza so
Yoh yoh yoh yoh

[Verse 1]
Caught up in the matrix
Looking for love in the wrong places
Cava the front page on a Sunday
When they discover our location
Cava the combination
All I need is a little patience
Takes guts to break up, the key to make up is foundation
Talking 'bout real life
When you do the right thing and it still don't feel right
Set the bar real high
You the broken heart, put your guard up, zero chill time
Why you gotta be's like this
Every single time I be overseas like this
Broken promises when I leave my crib
But you ain't got a problem spending the cheese I get
How many break-ups we gon' have
You even made me a plate
When I pull up at your place to bring your shit back
Even my ex call me a big fan
Give me a time frame I got big plans
But I don't buy face I buy sick bags
Jetlag and smoke zig zags
Fuck you the right way then play this back

[Chorus]
Running outta things I could prove myself
Way too busy winning I'ma lose myself
Everyday they gon' hate on us
Mama said she gon' pray for us
'Cause I can't do it on my own
You're that girlie, special somebody I know
You beside me turn this house into a home
Give me one good reason why ungenza so
Yoh yoh yoh yoh

[Verse 2]
I'm busy praying for a miracle
You was even in my video
See I wanted you for a long time
Couple years later now you're all mine
Star sign
Don't give me the cold shoulder like frost-bite
Keep it North side
X6 got four pipes
Golf 6 thatâ€™s small fries
They need an angle for their website
But we just living our best life
Gold chains is tangled on my chest like
We show up at the venue if the cheque right
Way too independent for your own good
Maybe that's the reason we started this season off on the wrong foot
Have to be strong, even your mom would
Recommend reading the Lord's book
I need 100 percent this is the last push
I just wanna jog your memory
In case you forgot I fought you and me
Paid the cost to follow our hearts' energies
Now all of a sudden my chick wanna leave
All of our fans is gon' grieve
All of our haters is gon' preach

[Chorus]
Running outta things I could prove myself
Way too busy winning I'ma lose myself
Everyday they gon' hate on us
Mama said she gon' pray for us
'Cause I can't do it on my own
You're that girlie, special somebody I know
You beside me turn this house into a home
Give me one good reason why ungenza so
Yoh yoh yoh yoh

[Verse 3]
Blue lights in the building
We ain't no ordinary civilians
You never sided Nyovest even if you North-West like Kanye's 'lil one
Way too busy counting up millions
Never gave a fuck about the opinions
God bless you the queen of my kingdom
Undress let me see the Brazillian
Let me teach you to love a real man
You want a boss or an Afro-Beat nigga with a six pack
Pardon me I had to express that
I know baby mama is where the stress at
Tryna be the best dad I respect that
One step forward and two steps back
I could never imagine being a step dad
They say you gotta stay woke
Supa Mega is in the same boat
This is my fault love is blind fold
In a different timezone how do I know
That she won't try unlock iPhone
You know she's on fire, Dubai flight mode
Tour guides with pythons we icons
Life's hard when mega stars collide dawg

[Chorus]
Running outta things I could prove myself
Way too busy winning I'ma lose myself
Everyday they gon' hate on us
Mama said she gon' pray for us
'Cause I can't do it on my own
You're that girlie, special somebody I know
You beside me turn this house into a home
Give me one good reason why ungenza so
Yoh yoh yoh yoh
