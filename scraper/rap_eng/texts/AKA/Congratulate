[Verse 1]
Starts out with a pipe dream
White T and an ice cream
All day on the MySpace
MJ, trying to buy face
I had to pay dues, had to make moves on faith
Even got booed off stage, trying to put food on plate
Dropped a couple jewels on tape, now we got views on Base
So much, love
Trust fund and Kas'lam
Bad chick in my address and she showing up with that plus one
Through depths and peaks, wolves dressed as sheep
Better protect the key while I pen this acceptance speech

[Bridge]
Do you see what it took? Is it clearer?
Who you see when you look in the mirror?
All the dreams and fantasies that come together
I'll be shining like a diamond that’s forever

[Hook]
Now congratulate me (x8)

[Verse 2]
Now this the moment I’ve been waiting for my whole life
Didn’t believe it ’til I seen with my own eyes
Imma need a black tux and a bow tie
Double cup, white chucks and a strobe light
Niggas have bad luck when they roll dice
The numbers add up and they don’t lie
Showtime, my bread butter on both sides
Took it to the champagne from the Morvite, now everybody come on
Aw’bula boot (aw’ bula boot)
JC le Roux (aw’bona)
That’s all I think about, sitting up in my room (sitting up in my room)
Aw’kuze kuse (aw’kuze kuse)
Aw gin and juice (Aw’ gin and juice)
It’s all coming back to me like Déjà vu

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Think back to my old days
All I wanted was a gold chain
So stuck in my old ways
Now we all household names
What you know about sacrifice, flashing lights, rights of passage for bragging rights
Bad romances, packs of pampers
And this ain’t time to be camera shy
My one homie got a gun in the cupboard
My other homie got a bun in the oven
Baby mama getting big in the stomach
Pop champagne or the Four Cousins
I think it’s time to be a man now
I feel like moving to my gran’s house
Everybody lined up for a handout
Really I just wanna make my old man proud

[Bridge]
