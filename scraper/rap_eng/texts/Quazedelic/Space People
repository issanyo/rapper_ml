[Verse One Brother J]

Yo
G freak-a deak-a
Street sweeper
Close encounter mother ship scroll keeper
My rhymes are featured as a path to the seekers
Who won't eat for the cake
And funk sprinkled on the teachings
Outreaching
Never leeching on the repetition conditions
My street knowledge mission is original
Completely
From pyramids to the mosque to the tipi
My bloodline is deep seed
And deep rooted
I stay black booted
Pimp strutting across the globe
For intelligent recruitment
Recycle a new movement
I'm like a cosmic pilgrim
With caravans of lyrical children
Straight true in living we building
My book of rhyme pages
Is blueprint for arc of the ages
Rattling the cages beyond these beats
It's the voice of the chosen
Earthbound an ET
Who are we?

[Chorus]

Space People
Moving underground to the e-n-d
Space People
Trying to find our way back to the galaxy
Space People
With all the tribulation to the end of time
Space People
Just funk all as one and free your mind

[Verse Two: Brother J]

We take it city to city
Back yard to yard
It's the zone transmission
Tone of the Gods
Spaceman in leather like General Zod
Ain't no super fools out here trying to funk with the God
But it's bigger than me
Upon this m-i-c
The arch enemy of war
Is the harmony in me
Define my flowetry (oh yes)
I guarantee you see a different type of method to my hip hop steez
Who are we?
(Space People)
Born to funk
Born to keep it loose and not [?] the trunk
I spent many life spans as a lord of funk
I used to teach all the pharaohs how to humpty-hump
Big up to Booga Monk
I keep them hands clapping
Step into my temple and let's really see what's happening
Filling in the gaps with this rapping bill
Coming live and direct from the cypher I build
G-o-d's

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Quazedelic]

[Q's verse is wack, so I'll stop here.]
