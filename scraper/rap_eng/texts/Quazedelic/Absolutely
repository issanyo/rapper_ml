Me and Nate Dogg were so funky fresh
We fell off into a club to try to pop it to Daz
A lil' Moet to go with the way I'm dressed
A seven-piece outfit with a mink vest
Couple of ladies skating waiting on some info
Them white boys in the back got the indo
With a hookup, a hundredd dollars for a half ounce
I got to hit it, get it and bounce
So right back to the place that I started from
Get back hell yeah I'm hardly done
Write that on your motherfucking izzass
So hold up your glass and let's make a lil' tizoast
We brag and boast, zig-zag and smoke and keep a big bag of dope
We hold down the VIP wherever we sit
Nigga don't get mad if your ho with me

[Nate Dogg]
I'm not absolutely positive or absolutely sure
I'm not out to talk bad about your baby
I'm just tyring to be completely sure
You wanna hang with us, gotta hang with us
Take ya ass to the floor
You try'n to claim a bitch, sound rediculous
Hope the ho is not yours

[Snoop Dogg]
Dancing and wining and dining a bitch
We humping bumping and grinding the shit
Nothing else to do now but to leave the club
So we can rub-a-dub-dub in my nigga Nate hot tub
Then we can grub on some barbeque
That my Uncle Rio hooked up, so call your crew
10, 11, 12, or 13, all of them bitches they belong to her team
It's so supreme you love my scheme
The way I got baby bringing Daddy all the cream
Yep, and that's the first step
And once you get that, nigga ya got that?
Pump that shit and fill up my cup and mack that bitch with the big ol' butt
Don't play with it - sway with it
And if it's cool with you, shit you know I'm okay with it

[Hook - Nate Dogg]
Right back, baby girl I know you like that
You try to hide it but you get
Right back, come on over for a nightcap
Yes even though I'm with the right trap
Tell your man that you'll be right back
Even though we only just met
Make sure you don't forget the Jim' pack

I'm not absolutely positive or absolutely sure
I'm not out to talk bad about your baby
I'm just tyring to be completely sure
You wanna hang with us, gotta hang with us
Take ya ass to the floor
I'm trying to game a bit, sound rediculous
Hope the ho is not yours

Whats happening to the thugs that be back in the club
And of course lil' mama who be backing it up
We be the ones back in the Cut' smoking
Cognac in the cup, we be stroking
After the club, same routine, roll two 13s
Since her front clean yahknowimean?
Tight jeans, ice bling, no ring, no thang
Show off, show her Nate can sing
Show her how my team do our thi-dang
And how we keep Latrell Sprewells sprinning
I'm all hood so the Chucks stay on
It's all good we can do it 'til the break of dawn
