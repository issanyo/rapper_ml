[Chorus]
Long way (long way)
We done came a long way nigga (long way)
Came a long way (long way)
We done came a long way nigga (long way)
Did it for my mama and my family them (swear to God)
Stayed true, never changed, now we finally here
Caught up reminiscin' in my head space
As I'm lookin' 'round the room I'm thinkin' God's great
We done came a long way (long way)
We done came a long way nigga (long way)
Bucket after bucket, I looked up to Cash Money
Told 'em I'll be rich them, niggas thought that shit was funny man
We done came a long way (long way)
We done came a long way nigga (long way)
We done came a long way (long way)
Got this shit the strong way nigga

[Verse 1]
When my nigga Fo died it's like I died too
I swear sometimes it's like I need you just to pull through
We make mistakes we can't erase but that's how life go
It's just the type of shit I'm thinkin' when the lights low
I had to cut some people off for me to elevate
Remind myself like everyday that I'm a heavyweight
I'm independent, there's a difference, get your facts straight
World tourin' off a motherfuckin' mixtape, God's great

[Chorus]
Long way (long way)
We done came a long way nigga (long way)
Came a long way (long way)
We done came a long way nigga (long way)
Did it for my mama and my family them
Stayed true, never changed now we finally here
Caught up reminiscing in my head space
As I'm looking round the room I'm thinking God's great
We done came a long way (long way)
We done came a long way nigga (long way)
Bucket after bucket I looked up to Cash Money
Told 'em I'll be rich them, niggas thought that shit was funny man
We done came a long way (long way)
We done came a long way nigga (long way)
We done came a long way (long way)
Got this shit the strong way nigga

[Verse 2]
I been gassin' up the tank, it ain't no lettin' up
I 'member rockin' Bugle Boy, but now I'm buttoned up
Them sucker niggas, they would laugh when I was comin' up
And now your girl would sell her soul to stand in front of us
Boy, I got the juice, I got the glow, I'm screamin' hallelujah
Fashion week in NYC, I feel like Rick The Ruler
My Rollie bezel fallin' off, I damn near shot the jeweler
I went and bought a bigger house for all these crazy rumors, facts though
And all my niggas proud of me (proud)
You feeling like I'm feeling, nigga smile for me (nation)
I felt like it was yesterday when I was prayin' for this real shit to resonate (nigga)

[Chorus]
Long way (long way)
We done came a long way nigga (long way)
Came a long way (long way)
We done came a long way nigga (long way)
Did it for my mama and my family them
Stayed true, never changed now we finally here
Caught up reminiscing in my head spaces
As I'm looking round the room I'm thinking God's great
We done came a long way (long way)
We done came a long way nigga (long way)
Bucket after bucket, I looked up to Cash Money
Told 'em I'll be rich them, niggas thought that shit was funny man
We done came a long way (long way)
We done came a long way nigga (long way)
We done came a long way (long way)
Got this shit the strong way nigga
