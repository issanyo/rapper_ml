[Chorus: Ace Hood]
Bottom of the map
Came outta' here
You ain't realer than
Fuck outta' here
Going way, way...
Way outta' here
Said I wouldn't pull through it
Fuck outta' here

[Bridge: Ace Hood]
I know some people caught cases
I know some people on papers
I know some people won't name 'em
That owe me a couple more favors
You can make it, I did
You can take shit, I did
You can fake it, they did
All they hatin' they did

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Came out like a braveheart
Meet at the graveyard
Cannot compete with the face card
You are not safe for the safeguard
We in the [?]
Showtime at Apollo
Having shit like it's a convo'
Hit a round with the gonzo
Still stickin' to the task
Never trippin' on the past
I ain't trippin' on a damn thing 'less a nigga playin' wit' my bag
What you doin', I done done it
People screamin' one-hundred
I know the turf 'cause I'm from it
The fake be hurtin' my stomach
Motivation my brother
Hit the gym and do wonders
Drop a tape and do numbers
Hit the bank for new hunda's
Shit cool, but be humble
If that's ya lady, don't fumble
Praise God, I been covered
I made it outta' that jungle

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
Bottom of the map
Came outta' here
You ain't realer than
Fuck outta' here
Going way, way...
Way outta' here
Said I wouldn't pull through it
Fuck outta' here

[Bridge: Ace Hood]
I know some people caught cases
I know some people on papers
I know some people won't name 'em
That owe me a couple more favors
You can make it, I did
You can take shit, I did
You can fake it, they did
All they hatin' they did

[Verse 2: O.Z.]
Uhh
Meet at the boat docks, I get your folks shot
I prayed oh I pray, got my momma out a dope spot
Best friends turned rival, had to fight for this title
Hollow-tips in my rifle, my ol' girl was my idol
I hope you cautious young solider, you know it's sharks in that water
My cousin taught me how to break it back and then we chop it down with that soda
I run laps around niggas
Carousel on these hoes
I take my problems with pride, and I thank the Lord when they go
And sizzle

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
Bottom of the map
Came outta' here
You ain't realer than
Fuck outta' here
Going way, way...
Way outta' here
Said I wouldn't pull through it
Fuck outta' here

[Bridge: Ace Hood]
I know some people caught cases
I know some people on papers
I know some people won't name 'em
That owe me a couple more favors
You can make it, I did
You can take shit, I did
You can fake it, they did
All they hatin' they did
