[Intro]
Devil, get off me
Blessed up
Count up
Nation
Woo

[Hook]
Rollie with the new face
Pocket full of blue faces
Over-fillin' my safe
Over-workin' my faith
I just got to give thanks
I just got to give thanks
We just havin' our way
I just gotta give thanks
Everythin' champagne
VVS's my change
Way too blessed to complain
Way too blessed to complain
Give thanks, give thanks

[Verse 1]
I'm in the end zone, fuck it's a field go
I know the real zoe's, you know the weirdos
I'm on some fly shit, I like a fly bitch
Used to see cockroaches when I hit the light switch
Young nigga came up, how could they blame us?
Know when the money arrived, we never decided to change up
Unless it's the whip game or maybe the wrist game
I'm with the big thing, we all on risk game
Rollin' cookies in the papers, ballin' like I'm in the Majors
Chosen one, I got the favor, did it all without a label
Money callin', got the money callin' like an alcoholic, I'm an addict
My niggas with me automatic, I was never goin' static
Blame the money and the status, turned a nigga to a savage
Turned a nigga to a beast, competition get deceased
Blessings on me, nigga, sheesh, young nigga better preach
Balmains on the feet, grindin' seven days a week

[Bridge]
Bless, bless, bless
Hallelujah, thank God, Amen

[Hook]
Rollie with the new face
Pocket full of blue faces
Over-fillin' my safe
Over-workin' my faith
I just got to give thanks
I just got to give thanks
We just havin' our way
I just gotta give thanks
Everythin' champagne
VVS's my change
Way too blessed to complain
Way too blessed to complain
Give thanks, give thanks

[Verse 2]
I'm in the Benzo (skrr, skrr), I smell like a check though
This what they mad for? Look how the neck glow
I'm with the lit gang, you with them lame lames
Four, three, two, one, call it a ball game
Countin' blessings, since an adolescent, I've been really destined for the greatest
I just give 'em motivation, I be speakin' revelation
Nigga started in the basement, I handle bars like a waitress
People tell me I'm the chosen, gotta keep it focused, runnin' outta patience
HN on the logo, real ones, no pretendo
No games, no Nintendo, don't you open up the window
God damn, I'm fresh, God damn, she sexy
You for certain that she yours? I bet tomorrow she text me

[Hook]
Rollie with the new face
Pocket full of blue faces
Over-fillin' my safe
Over-workin' my faith
I just got to give thanks
I just got to give thanks
We just havin' our way
I just gotta give thanks
Everythin' champagne
VVS's my change
Way too blessed to complain
Way too blessed to complain
Give thanks, give thanks

[Outro]
Devil, get off me
Devil, get off me
