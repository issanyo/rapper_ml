[Intro: DJ Khaled & Chris Brown]
Money long, the night is young
Another one
The world is ours (Ah)
DJ Khaled (Yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, DJ Khalded & Lil Wayne]
I know a lot of niggas in here probably hate me right now
But I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
That ain't gon' change a thing, no (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Still gon' do my thing
I'm still, yeah, yeah, still gon' go and get mine (Get mine)
Still gon' keep on winnin' (Keep winnin'), still gon' keep it 100 every time
You know I'm still, I'm still even when them niggas throw shots
I'm still, I'm still, still gon' end up on top
I'm still
Pussy ass niggas stop hatin'

[Verse 1: Wale]
Ralph, uh
Niggas be women like hoes be women
Look at me close, there's no sympathy
Those with envy be throwin' subliminal quotes
I'd rather them warrin' with me, uh
They phony I hate them (Word)
Like Tony Montana, except, no Manolo
She left me for another cuelo (Word)
These dudes is snakes, these women is vultures
Who am I to trust? Who gon' ride for me?
Who gon' light somebody's body up?
When I be like, "Yup," they squeeze
Comfortably (Oh) and that new custom piece
My Tisci t-shirt a couple of G's (Oh)
I talked to a bunch of G's just like a Frozen Tundra speech
And the Lambo' feel
When a real nigga doin' 110 tryna skrrt in it
Yeah, and the world so ill
When the boy get funny over money or a girl on ya
Uh, let it marinate, uh, Wal', let me curate
Uh, let them niggas hate
But never ever let a women tell a nigga, "Wait"'
Uh, sway

[Chorus: Chris Brown, DJ Khalded & Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I know a lot of niggas in here probably hate me right now
But I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
That ain't gon' change a thing (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Still gon' do my thing
I'm still, yeah, yeah, still gon' go and get mine (Get mine)
Still gon' keep on winnin' (Keep winnin'), yeah, still gon' keep it 100 every time
You know I'm still, I'm still even when them niggas throw shots
I'm still, I'm still, still gon' end up on top
I'm still
Pussy ass niggas stop hatin'

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa, Wale & Chris Brown]
(Woo)
Most of these niggas ain't raw
Most of these niggas ain't poppin' (Niggas ain't poppin')
Most of these niggas ain't ballin'
Most of these niggas, they starvin'
Talkin' about cars and, what the fuck?
They don't even got 'em
So high, don't see no problems
Bitch, I'm on them trees like Tarzan (Trees like Tarzan)
Aw man (Aw man), I want all my cheese like Robin (Robin)
Shrimp or calamari, I'm a young nigga with options (Young nigga with options)
Mm, and you close but y'all ain't close enough
In the VIP, call me the poster child for postin' up
Top floor suite we goin' up
D.A.F. I'm dope as fuck
Woo, hundred bottles comin'
That mean a hundred bottles gettin' opened up
Rolex face all frozen
Expect y'all to hate, y'all ain't supposed to love it
She backin' up, like a Tonka truck (Like a Tonka truck)
(Ah) Hahaha

[Chorus: Chris Brown, DJ Khalded & Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I know a lot of niggas in here probably hate me right now (Yeah, yeah)
But I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
That ain't gon' change a thing, no, yeah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Still gon' do my thing
I'm still, yeah, yeah, still gon' go and get mine (Get mine, yeah)
Still gon' keep on winnin' (Keep winnin'), yeah, still gon' keep it 100 every time
You know I'm still, yeah, I'm still even when them niggas throw shots (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still, I'm still, still gon' end up on top
I'm still
Pussy ass niggas stop hatin'

[Verse 3: DJ Khaled, Ace Hood & Chris Brown]
Fuck boy, I kept it real
Came up, wake up, feeling blessed
Pockets full, no stress
At the shop, we the best
Cuttin' checks, eatin' good
Lovin' life, projects all night (Ace Hood)
(I'm still) I'm still gon' shine bright in that limelight

[Verse 4: Ace Hood]
Woo, okay now it's no more Mr. Nice Guy (Nah)
And you niggas couldn't see me in the daytime (Woo)
Girl, you got a better chance gettin' a day job (Haha)
Your career wouldn't blow away the napalm (Boom)
Ha, silly motherfucker (Motherfucker)
I'm the type to win the game on the buzzer (On the buzzer)
I'm the type to make a whole lot of money
Buy a whole new crib 'cause I'm bored as a mother
And it's still fuck a hater
Still gon' ball like I'm Kobe from the Lakers (Ah)
Still we the best, and it's still hood nation
And I'm still gon' smoke even if I'm on papers

[Chorus: Chris Brown, DJ Khalded & Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I know a lot of niggas in here probably hate me right now (Yeah, yeah)
But I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
That ain't gon' change a thing, no, yeah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Still gon' do my thing
I'm still, yeah, yeah, still gon' go and get mine (Get mine, yeah)
Still gon' keep on winnin' (Keep winnin'), yeah, still gon' keep it 100 every time
You know I'm still, I'm still even when them niggas throw shots
I'm still, I'm still, still gon' end up on top (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still
Pussy ass niggas stop hatin'
