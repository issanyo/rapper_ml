Ever since I can remember I been balling like a bitch
Private plane champagne bitches gettin switched
Ever since that money came they been on the D
Them fine supermodels always end up on my lease

[Verse 1]
What is he in for fuck what that pussy cost
I blow up 20 thousand Niemans just to piss them off
Bitch I'm here to set it off I'm here to set it off
You used to be the man homey now you falling off
You niggas buy the bar I buy the club out
My condo on the beach call it my club house LMAO what the fuck they hating for
Stay in some sneakers that don't drop until "the month's out?"
Every time I ride I keep my nine I'm talking Romo
Niggas runnin they mouth I get to snapping like a photo
You fall in love with all these bitches that's a no-no
You pillow talking with these hoes, you's a homo
Stick to the G code I remain in beast mode
See me throwin money like I'm working on free throw
If I'm spending money, she officially my freak ho
And I keep them thangs they go wherever that we go
