[Interlude]
Loyalty ain't just when it's convenient
Like loyalty ain't when it's convenient
That's why I said what I said
People scream "loyalty loyalty" but if he ain't give that bag, he ain't create that opportunity
Would you still be loyal to him?
You probably wouldn't, you know what I mean?
But it's convenient for you at that time to be, to do so
So you gon play your part, play the position
I'm just looking to connect with motherfuckers that creative
And I just wanna build some shit, not only for themselves but wanna build together, like build this thing that's incredible
'Cause it all starts from here
You know, I look at Dre and all the people who in the creditable have done it before in the past
Like it started from ideas and somebody believed
A few people believe and say "I will do this"
