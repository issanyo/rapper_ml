[Chorus]
Young nigga shinin'
They ain't gon' like this
I'mma your highness
I'm a king, I'm a giant (king)
Blessed up, righteous (blessed up)
Boosted the prices
They ain't gon' like this
They ain't gon' like this
I'm Ego Trippin'
[?] your friend don't like this
They ain't gon' like it
Beast in the gym, nigga' him like Tyson
Everyone frightened
VVS bitin', I'ont need the lightin'
They ain't gon' like this
Just got word 'bout a check, like Nike

[Verse 1]
Nigga too hyphy
Touch my chain, shit's really unlikely
Night, night, nighty
Just in case you awake with an IV
Never been pussy
Have me outside of your bushes
Plottin' while your girlfriend cookin'
Just cause you sayin' I wouldn't
The other niggas sayin' I couldn't
Ridin' in the foreign, I push it
Smokin' on some Girlscout Cookies
Vet muthafucka', no rookie
Bands in my pant, like kush
Came in the game, I shook it
I prophesied, the prophet's rising, open minded, said she loved my humble vibin'
Smile

[Chorus]
Young nigga shinin'
They ain't gon' like this
I'mma your highness
I'm a king, I'm a giant
Blessed up, righteous
Boosted the prices
They ain't gon' like this
They ain't gon' like this
I'm Ego Trippin'
[?] your friend don't like this
They ain't gon' like it
Beast in the gym, nigga him like Tyson
Everyone frightened
VVS bitin', I'ont need the lightin'
They ain't gon' like this
Just got word 'bout a check, like Nike

[Verse 2]
Live yo' life
Take that chance, betta' roll that dice
You can't live twice
Once I drop, I'mma boost that price
They ain't gon' like
Real nigga, I sleep good at night
Ya'll all hype
Nigga got problems, all on site
Don't nobody panic
I'm playing real low, in the cut like a bandage
Your chick keep starin'
You must can't manage, but you ain't keep dancing
Bling, blinged out
They could never stop us now
I prophesied, the prophet's rising, open minded, said she loved my humble vibin'
Smile

[Chorus]
Young nigga shinin'
They ain't gon' like this
I'mma your highness
I'm a king, I'm a giant
Blessed up, righteous
Boosted the prices
They ain't gon' like this
They ain't gon' like this
I'm Ego Trippin'
[?] your friend don't like this
They ain't gon' like it
Beast in the gym, nigga him like Tyson
Everyone frightened
VVS bitin', I'ont need the lightin'
They ain't gon' like this
Just got word 'bout a check, like Nike
