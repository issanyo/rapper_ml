(Ca$h Out) what’s crapping nigga?
I might get in trouble for this one
Brand new Ca$h Out Ace Hood
Dj Bobby Black!
I came through the gate! I came
To give’em hell And they know well that I’m
Wealthy
And I’m healthy
I said out E nigga
Take out my sneakers nigga
Them yeys nigga I mean them…nigga
I spit some Gs nigga don’t sneeze
Nigga
When the shooter’s standing round
Get body vented
No body found
(CHORUS)
Uh oh, they at my door
(They at my door!)
I don’t wanna go, I just flash the
Phone
And I ain’t talking bout no rap shit
Real life shit I’m talkin bout that trap shit
You ain’t never seen word jamming
Out that boat
When you a D boy they touch they
Toes
Yeah, oh oh they at my door See I be on lean they be on purp
Won’t move the killer’s alert
Niggers is sweet talking desert
No 9 to 5 they gotta work
All of my bitches keep pistols in
Purses Do what I say if I tell her to twerk
Marry the cash for better or worse
Funds are in and out on the first
Feds are knocking answer the door
Trap be booming then I beat them
Folks Too many choppers in all of this
Dough
Shooters inside and 2 on the post
Watching for feds you already
Know
Flush that quick no people approach
May get cold but never do tall
Never we snitches fuck the law
What’s heading nigga?
What’s cracking for?
As long as my money right That clip will never be you
Still in that new thing my bitch
From back and root
Couple mill rich you could smell the
Fumes Oh, oh they at my door
They at my door!
I don’t work out I just flash the
Phone
And I ain’t talking bout no rap shit
Real life shit I’m talkin bout that trap shit
You ain’t never seen word jamming
Out that boat
When you a D boy they touch they
Toes
Yeah, oh oh they at my door
