[Intro : 2Pac Talking]
I'm not saying I'm Jesus, but I'm saying we go through that type of things every day
We don't part the Red Sea, but we walk through the 'hood without without  getting shot ,you know what I mean ?
We don't turn water to wine, but we turn motherfucking dope dope fiends and dope heads into profitable productive citizens

[Verse 1:]
I hate to say it but most of my niggas in prison or jail
They told me it's tough to believe in a God when you living in hell
The guns gets loaded and bodies get dropped in this shit everyday
Your mama's a christian her only position's continue to pray
Crack babies all in the hood and junkies all over the jets
When niggas would sell on their uncle it's just to come up on a check
My young nigga called me told me he tryna move out the ghetto
Cause he might walk out the door and the police can shot him whenever
I'm raised in a city if there is a problem you don't call the cops
Nigga this shit is so real in the field that we play with the Glocks
Our father which art in heaven
Hollows will be in the clip, I pray that you send me a blessing
My message to young'ns is pick up a book and let's put down the heat
Murders on top of the murders, another one covered in sheets
Another memorial, candles and teddy bears all in the streets
Another lil nigga who face on a shirt as he resting in peace
Just cause you throwing your life away that do not mean that you gangsta
I don't consider that real when they go flashing the banger
Niggas who really 'bout violence they only move in silence
Niggas react on emotions just shows me the lack of knowledge
Just being honest
Restricting our minds from seeing the world we holding it hostage
Go and get some money and put your momma up into a crib nigga
Never hated on whoever made it that's real nigga
Pray for my mind and pray for my soul and cover my body
Lord, they think I'm part of the illuminati
Only because of this fucking Bugatii
These niggas with me will shot up your party
So many blessings but still I be stressing
I just want so head from this bitch that I'm texting
Is it too much that I ask for?
Guess that's why my career slow
My niggas don't want to see me grow
Fuck it you ain't got to understand
Get it popping just like a frying pan
Sick of weight I need a diet plan
Seven figures on my new advance
Lord knows screaming fuck them all
They pop up missing I am not involved
The devil hit me but I missed the call
Ain't no humble I'm just warning y'all
Tell them niggas ain't no love lost
Building mines just like a real boss
Hood Nation til my expiration
Follow me to my destination


[Outro: 2Pac Talking]
I'm not saying I'm Jesus, but I'm saying we go through that type of things every day
We don't part the Red Sea, but we walk through the 'hood without  without getting shot you know what I mean?
We don't turn water to wine, but we turn motherfucking dope dope fiends and dope heads into profitable citizens
