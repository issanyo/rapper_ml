[Verse 1]
Way to focused, bitch I'm chosen
Heart so cold, bitches frozen
Count that guapo, they killed my kiddos
Stay away from weirdos, 'gotta tint my windows
'Gotta find my grooving again, gotta get back moving again
'gotta add that half it again, step on they neck for the win
'Gotta add that ace to the end, I'ma rep that shit to the end
I'ma skert, skert, skert in the Benz, them birds chirp, chirpin' again
I'ma keep shit jig with the woadies, I'ma keep good kush in the stogie
In the rap game young like Kobe
Knowing none of y'all niggas can hold me
Knowing none of y'all niggas can hold me
Knowing none of y'all niggas don't know me
Knowing most of y'all niggas so phony
Long as none of y'all niggas don't owe me
Yea, yea

[Verse 2]
Living in glory
I got no worries
Pulling up wherever it's at, I'm like Steph Curry
Been a long-long journey
I never been perfect
You 'gotta be worthy
A nigga done flourished
Put your mind on the mula still doing my thing hallelujah
Ain't never gonna trip on the rumors
Had to give myself a lil' little tune-up
Ain't fucking with the lames i'm allergic
I'ma shine so bright on purpose
What's a king to a god to a serpent
Trying to be a way-way better version
Of me
Beast
Focused on living my dreams
Celebrate it with the team
Want it so bad I could scream
Many people hope I'm folding
Bad bitches on my notice
Rap niggas still be trolling
Watching everything I'm posting
