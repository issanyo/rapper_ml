I can do the pretty girl rock, rock
Rock to the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Now, what's your name?
My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly oh my, it's a little bit scary
Boys wanna marry, looking at my deri
Aye, you can stare, but if you touch it, then I'ma bury
Pretty as a picture sweeter than a swisher
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that is with ya
I can talk about it 'cause I know that I'm pretty
If you know it too, then ladies sing it with me
My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly oh my, it's a little bit scary
Boys wanna marry, looking at my deri
Aye, you can stare, but if you touch it, then I'ma bury
Pretty as a picture sweeter than a swisher
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that is with ya
I can talk about it 'cause I know that I'm pretty
If you know it too, then ladies sing it with me
All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a 10
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
My walk, my talk, the way I dress
It's not my fault, so please don't trip
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Aye, now do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock
All my ladies do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, now where you at?
If you're looking for me, you can catch me
Cameras flashing, daddy's turned his head as soon as I passed him
Girls think I'm conceited 'cause I know I'm attractive
Don't worry about what I think, why don't you ask him?
Get yourself together, don't hate
(Don't do it)
Jealous is the ugliest trait
(Oh, don't do it)
I can talk about it 'cause I know that I'm pretty
If you know it too, then ladies sing it with me
All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a 10
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
My walk, my talk, the way I dress

Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Doing the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock

All my ladies do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Get along with your pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Steal the show your pretty girl rock, rock
