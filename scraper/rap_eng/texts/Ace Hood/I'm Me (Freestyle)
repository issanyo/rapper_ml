[Verse 1]
Ay, say hello to mister cutthroat, bodies on the damn floor
All about that cash floor like my money in bank rolls
These haters think, they know I’m the shit like my asshole
And I’m from the city where fucking snitches don’t last long
And I’m in your city, I keep it real, I get mad stone
Yes that be Broward County, I love it, it’s still home
If they don’t like it I say fuck em till they walls gone
Come to my city, got to meet up with your man homie
Fall out of there, pumping [?] would be my damn zone
This be that knew Ace, you get service like a cell phone
They got that coke as bright as white, it’s like a snow cone
And I’m me, give my all behind this microphone
I give my blood, sweat, and tears before my casket close
Until then, Imma give them what they asking for
Hop out of that newer shit, Louis kicks waving, make em fix
See me with that swag, and I blow a case at your lady, T
Fuck the politics, I am all the shit that I say I am
Yes I know I am blessed, I am Bonnie’s angel, I’m heaven sent
That’s word to mother, mama never see your baby quit
Ain’t no matter how many blocks or haters a youngin get
So F em all, I’m taking over, let me in this bitch
This rubber bang, it go grenades when I be in the mix
I got my hand over that door, and now they shitting bricks
I’m climbing to the top, and everyone’s like who is this
Tell em who’s the shit, Ace Hood homie
And I want back, I sound like Dilla for a couple M’s
And I am next to be the best up off this southern limb
I’m from the city where there ain’t no-
And I want back, I sound like Dilla for a couple M’s
And I am next to be the best up off this southern limb
I’m from the city where there ain’t no mister millionaires
That’s why the day I got my deal I cried 100 tears
Cause once I got it, promised mama that we out of here
My swag changed, and I lit up like the city fair
I started doing interviews and photoshoots to death
Them niggas seen it, it ain’t Holly, but this shit ain’t fair
Why he ain’t choose me, how come he chose him
Well play this song back and listen to this shit again [x3]
Make sure you comprehend, make sure you understand
I am the fucking man
