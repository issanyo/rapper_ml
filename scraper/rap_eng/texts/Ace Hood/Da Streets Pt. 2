[Verse 1:]
Ok only God above the only man can judge
Flip a brick to a benz i will reveal who to plug
Over money i know some young ones that turn on their blood
Them niggers just bigger bitches who is the number one
I never going to turn on my niggers ‘out that shit on my sister
Keep that hole in the ride and I’m talking my little pistol
Out on these streets selling coke most of my friends
Turn to foes some of these niggers are bitches
Most of these women be holes but
I just stay on my grizzle fuck we getting money niggers
Most of these pussies be talking i really know them for killers
Don't even go there dont even dont even go there
Most of my niggers commit felonies about a week ago
Boy don't make me go there
I holla at that fucker pussy and all that shit you stand for
These people be hating that i made it what you mad for
I’m doin me my lui jeans is full of cash flow
And only real nigga shit is what i stand on
Am out of my mind I’m doing 200 on the dash board
My whip is a rari and i better keep a passport
My chopper gold and i ain’t trying to dash James hold
And 20 G’s that shit just buried me with chains on pussy

[Chorus:]
Hey i know about myself so nigga dont go there
So my nigga dont go there
And a hundred niggers is waiting all over there
Its ready to go there
That shit that they talking
Tell that nigga to fuck that shit that they talking
Fuck that shit that they talking
Yeah fuck that shit that they talking

[Verse 2:]
Fuck that shit that they talking all these niggers talkng
And my shooters be retarded
Leave all you niggers be departed
Got to get you some angels
So you can be guarded lets believe I’ll be finished
If you pussy boys be started cause I’m on some shit
Cause I’m some shit
I don't really think you niggers want to come and try this
Fuck nigga i wish pop this clip then pop your shit
Yea nigga i go there and i take it quick
Nigga you better watch you be saying
Shooting everything nigga dont even be aiming
Think I’m playing niggers what you been saying
And bullet brings the pain like it's raining
Nigga it’s pain i need a spot
How you niggers be walking around with a case
So niggers don't go there
You going to need some help all my niggers all over there
My niggers all over there i ain't by my self

[Chorus]
