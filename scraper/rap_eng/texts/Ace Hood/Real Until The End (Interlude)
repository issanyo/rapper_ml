[Intro]
Ay
Ain't my first impression ay
In God we trust

[Verse]
Rolling on woods
Smokin' on good
Fuck nigga free
I'm feeling real good
I'm playin' in a Benzo
Tints on the window
Don't like the bando
I'm low like the ammo
I'm usually the life of the party
I'm sippin' on brown with a barbie
Nigga kush get louder than Cardi
You would think I was king to the mollies
All about that bag
Gotta feed my kids
Gotta build that bridge
Gotta fill my fridge
Gotta feel my glow
Everything must go
When they gettin' too gassed
I'ma switch my MO
Never make full stops at a red light
Last thing that they seen was a bright light
I'm in love with the club and the night life
Sports centre, checkin in on the highlights
Young nigga gon' ball
Antonio Brown
A rappin' hood nation
I'm holding that down
I'm living my life to the full
Living my life to the full
All that hating
I'ma use it all as the fuel
I'ma use it all as the fuel
Show up in the vert
Gotta go and touch that turf
Gotta go and make my worth
First to the first
Queen keep a thing in her purse
Ain't have to say it in the verse
Way a nigga work
I don't need xanax to perk
Ain't tryna cope with a curse
Real to the end of the earth
Real to the end of the earth, ay
Real to the end of the earth
Real to the end of the earth, ay
