Struggle in my past, painted my expressions
Running on my last, avoid the deep depressions
Beefing with the bottom, I'm so afraid of fallin
And all these fucking problems turning me into an alcoholic
Where did I go wrong, I swear this can't be life
17 and pregnant, that just can't be right
In love with a man who fucking your friend depends on what you like
(This Bitter Earth)
Uh, this world is crazy, even my babies, gotta receive the sight
Just ask the lord to give me the strength so they believe what's right
And not some smooth nigga who trying to get her home tonight
Invest in a gun and hope that the thug who come just ain't the type
It's a cold world, keep your sweater close
Made it big but seems like family the ones who hate the most
That's a damn shame, how dare you doubt your blood
Don't know my real father, how come he dropped my love
Why when Iâ€™m all alone, there's no one to hug
He left me all alone, how could you leave your cub
But fuck it I'm a man, with or without your ass
They ask about my pain, some things I wish that I had
Just thank the man above, my mom's consider my dad
She working spending her last, whatever we wanted we had
The struggle created a man, no longer your job demands
No thoughts of contraband, I've failed and let's re-planned
I've been through hell and back, but still I'm here to stand
Mama need a house, so fuck it I bought some land
Dyin' to be the greatest, but greater comes with patience
Got my business right, and plus my mama good
What more heart is just to say I made it out the hood
You fucking right, Bitter World
Cried a hundred tears when I see my baby girls
When I see my baby girls

Damn!

Blood, sweat, and tears, this my testimony
Just know the world is yours! Ain't that right, Tony?
Gas prices high, niggas dying young
Bad role models, that's what that came from
That's what that came from

(This Bitter World) My God
(Well, well) My God (Well, This Bitter Earth)

Dear World, dear World, I need you undivided
And know some choices that we made were highly undecided
We keep it in mind, we givin em signs, the time just disregard it
(This bitter world)
Some live in the blind afraid of the light
But pain just can't be departed
The things that I seen, I wish it was dreams, it seems I'm sleeping hardly
Lost a lot of homies, endured a lot of pain
Pray for better nights, slowly they became
I hear my phone ring, fuck who callin me
I just hope that it's success who trying to bother peace
Fuck this bitter world, with no apologies
Babies having babies, what could your father be
Sick of being tired, and tired of being broke
Mama worked too hard, I pray no signs of stroke
Microphone and words, clearly show me hope
Without it I'm alone, clearly you should know

(Well, well)
Amen
(Well, This Bitter Earth)
