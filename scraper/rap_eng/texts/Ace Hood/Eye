[Intro]
Nation
Yeah
Three a.m. in the evening
Zone
Yeah
(Ooh)

[Chorus]
(Uh)
Nah, I ain't perfect
Young nigga know it ain't even worth it
Niggas ain't trippin', young niggas out here workin' (yeah)
It's hell in the streets, young niggas out here purging
Never be somebody else burden
Want it, then you gotta go and earn it, "you learning?"
Oh no, this cannot be life, oh no, this cannot be life
Don't you get caught in the hype, that's when they turn off your lights
You ain't believe in the vision, so, therefore I'm charging you twice
They didn't believe in redemption until...
Eye

[Verse 1]
Hopped up right outta' the ride
Fly as a kite
I'm on a natural high
How 'bout the vision and life
Young nigga thrive
I let the Tesla glide
Pretty bitch passion decide
Life is a vibe
Fuck 'em, whoever despise
Some people poorly designed
Outta they mind
Ace is just one of a kind
Patient, I waited in line
I am divine
God got me though
Hard-body flow
Masterpiece in my dreams
Michaelangelo
Young Piccasso
Arigato

[Bridge]
This some shit you probly' never seen before
Ain't this that, "oh my goodness", hallelujah glow
You never seen this in your lifetime, lifetime

[Chorus]
(Uh)
Nah, I ain't perfect
Young nigga know it ain't even worth it
Niggas ain't trippin', young niggas out here workin' (yeah)
It's hell in the streets, young niggas out here purging
Never be somebody else burden
Want it, then you gotta go and earn it, "you learning?"
Oh no, this cannot be life, oh no, this cannot be life
Don't you get caught in the hype, that's when they turn off your lights
You ain't believe in the vision, so, therefore I'm charging you twice
They didn't believe in redemption until...
Eye

[Verse 2]
Showed them the will and the way
Niggas obey
Predators lay on the prey
Money asleep in the safe
Keep up the faith
Never let off of the breaks
"Fuck would I ever portray?"
I am the great
Overprotecting my space
Basic, you cannot relate (hey)
Gotta absorb, you can't force it
Spendin' my time on important
Lovin the thrill of new Porches (okay)
Never regrettin' my choices (nah)
I'm just applying pressure
Feel like its now or never
Feel like I got in my way, it was patient
Do not let my humbleness fool you, ever
This is that gifted, them lifted levels
This is prolific, I put together
This how it look when you never settle
Know I'mma die for these gold medals
My flow equivalent to niggas sittin' inside of that sauna with all leather
We worked our way out that bad weather
Ain't no complainin', just made it better
Zone

[Chorus]
(Uh)
Nah, I ain't perfect
Young nigga know it ain't even worth it
Niggas ain't trippin', young niggas out here workin' (yeah)
It's hell in the streets, young niggas out here purging
Never be somebody else burden
Want it, then you gotta go and earn it, "you learning?"
Oh no, this cannot be life, oh no, this cannot be life
Don't you get caught in the hype, that's when they turn off your lights
You ain't believe in the vision, so, therefore I'm charging you twice
They didn't believe in redemption until...
