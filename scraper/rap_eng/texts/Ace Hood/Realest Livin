[Intro: Birdman]
Realest Livin'

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
OK now hood off in this mother fucker
Got the niggas all rolling hollering
Beast back in this mother fucker
And im into this bitch
Don't make me click off in this motherfucker
Better ask them bitches, I’ll be swimming on they distance lover
Wanna have my baby? trick you crazy
I keeps a rubber
Never ever play me for no sucker
And I ain't stutter
I ain't into that bull i sip Muscatto and im lay back
That brand new Maserati inside of a suede black
And the chick im with hella thick just know that I filet that
I swear that pussy good, she good, she looky, love the nookie
I’m just a nigga who addicted to this money flow
Ain’t nobody on his level run and tell him fo
That’s real shit, I swear my swagger keep an attitude
Pistol on me homie, he won’t show no gratitude!
Don’t want no problems, let this bust off in your blatter too
Standing ovation for the realest nigga in the room

[Bridge]
From the day that I was born, up out the womb
Pledge allegiance to keep you real and pay my dues
Honor the mother and the father, death 'fore honor
I hear my brothers keeper and that's before the mighty dollar
Standing ovation!

[Hook]
For the realest nigga living
Standing ovation!
For the realest nigga living
Standing ovation!
For the realest nigga living
Standing ovation!
For the realest nigga living
Standing ovation!

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who the realest?
They say that God don't fear nobody I'm his spitting image
Look in my eyes and see the beast
My kind is rare invented
Choppa on the seat will have you call on your religion
Father God come and bless me, I'm a sinner mane
You know these niggas talking tough, gone need a dinner plan
Don't make me send those niggas off into that mini van
I ain’t no killer, put a thousand on your brother head
Real shit, you're looking at the realest living tho
Only niggas speaking real, I never sugarcoat
Way to many nigga banging and they’re selling dough
I don’t know what it’s about it, I just get my hustle on
Too legit the quit, I really got my heater chrome
Call that style my BFF and I don’t leave it home
And that's word to my momma, don't want no drama
Loyal to the bone, and that’s before I see the commas

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Smoking like Harry Potter
My flow keep getting hotter
She dances to my single
Bet she just want a dollar
Uh, but I got her, I know she a dog
She know that I’m balling, she know who’s the boss
Got the 2 door, the 4 door, i even get the trucks
Getting loo like ma ludo mammy, I got the bucks
Call it killers, they're lurking I see 'em in the gust
Remember as soon as I point a finger, you’re getting touched
Play with fire, I could get you sent to hell
Angel of death, I could hear her on the cell
Speed dial, double MG
God Forgives And I Don't, you niggas will see

[Bridge + Hook]
