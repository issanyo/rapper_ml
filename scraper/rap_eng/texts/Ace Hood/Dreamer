(Ace Hood Talking)
I like this right here, courtesy of (The Renegades) What up! Spark up!

(Chorus)
Now I've been through so much shit in my life dog and I can't take it
And I can see my goals right in front of my eyes, dog and I'm gonna make it
And you can bet your bottom dollar, that I won't quit, no, no, no, not me
And I'ma keep pushing, hustling, and remain on my grind, yeah

(First Verse)
Triple black whip em in the city day dreaming
Sipping while I’m trippin’ duckin’ behind the tinted leanin’
Ridin’ in the 2012, hell they ain't seen it
Rolly on an arm, louboutin, thanks Neiman
Throwing deuces to my niggas when I ride by
Pistol on me, see my haters through my side eye
I just drive by, all my bitches top notch
Reminiscing how I'm living, boy does time fly
In a state of mind on Interstate 9-5
In conversation with guys who stay in suit and ties
7 figures, I'd figured that I would beat the odds
Sorry, that's your lady fucking other nigga broads
Never mind me; I'm just a black man
Let them tell it I won't make it unless I'm light skinned
Say my past is jealous of all my future plans
Cause I'm 7 figures up, they say I never can
I'm involved with them conversations
So when they talking phantoms I just might elaborate it
Dream chasing, fuck haters, mama crib gated
Cool lady, crusadin' up in 2 ladies
Had 2 babies looking like they damn daddy
Still at it, the swag is so illmatic, its so illmatic
I'm day dreaming the instrumental is real magic

(Chorus)
Now I've been through so much shit in my life dog and I can't take it
And I can see my goals right in front of my eyes, dog and I'm gonna make it
And you can bet your bottom dollar, that I won't quit, no, no, no, not me
And I'ma keep pushing, hustling, and remain on my grind, yeah

(Second Verse)
Back at it, feenin’ like crack addicts
Doing your main lady, I'm sorry, it's bad habits
She in love with the life, I deliver the pipe
I'm addicted to money; I usually say it twice, yeah
Lord blessed me in the major way, negotiation with money
My only major pain
Now my lady's problems ain't that damn bad
Went from time to find a dollar to them brown bags
Now its Louie 50 pattern every hand bag
Ask my lady, she gonna do whatever I desire
Grip that ass like a brand new pair work pliers
Getting hotter now my show priced twice higher
Jeep wagon Asanti’s on 26” tires
Riding with a Asian bitch who love street fighters, yeah
23 I've been through hell and back
Still I promise mama, I’ma bring that money back

(Chorus)
Now I've been through so much shit in my life dog and I can't take it
And I can see my goals right in front of my eyes, dog and I'm gonna make it
And you can bet your bottom dollar, that I won't quit, no, no, no, not me
And I'ma keep pushing, hustling, and remain on my grind, yeah
