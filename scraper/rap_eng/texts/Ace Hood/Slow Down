[Verse 1: Kevin Cossom]
Now you wanna tell me slow it down
When I tell you bring them hoes around
Wanna kill it but you can’t stop, slow down the time

[Ace Hood]
Asking me to slow down
When my feelings all caught up now
It’s been months and I ain’t seen you
Heard to the 'vine, gonna rock a rebound

[Kevin Cossom]
Now she begging me, she begging me
She ready to do everything
Are you missing me? Well, you’d better be
Let’s slow, slow it down

[Ace Hood]
Remember that time we was out in Puerto Rico?
Told me that you love me, you can never be a sequel
Wish I could’ve paused our love like TiVo
My homie KC, told me that’s the way to be though

[Kevin Cossom]
She says that I’m stupid, heck I’m stupid
I ain’t gotta ask, she just do it
Said she the best, I say prove it
We gon' slow down the time

[Ace Hood]
Ain’t nothing like me you can bet your bottom dollar
Think I should've called, well I never do bother
Heard you in school, you a fan, you scholar
Heard them doing better now the trip gone wild

[Kevin Cossom]
Celebrity, celebrity
Shining star so heavily
But damn, I got other things on my mind
You wanna slow down the time

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]
Now you wanna tell me slow it down
When I tell you bring them hoes around
Wanna kill it but you can’t stop
Only call you after 1 o’clock
Your bad money got sorta fine
I like it but it's kinda border line
Tryna put them thoughts in my mind
You wanna slow down the time

[Ace Hood]
Slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down (slow down the time)
Slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down (slow down the time)
Slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Okay, I’m cool with a bitch named Sandra Lee
Friends with her twin and they both the beast
Head give me and they Vietnamese
And they love fucking me, they got the similar dream
Money steady calling, so I fuck ‘em and leave
Waste my time and I’m chuckin’ the D
So they beggin’ me to just

[Kevin Cossom]
Slow down
You read my mind
Girl, do that same thing every time
Jack when you’re around
But I don’t know if I, I don’t know if I
Could slow it down, slow it down

[Verse 3]
My nigga ACDC
He has six girls for us that’s three a piece, three a piece
What they hittin’ for?
He said that we may just wanna be down with the crew
I said I’ll be on my way
He said they already on juice
I'm already on that kush
Already on that 80 proof
I buff in my coup
I press a button and lose the roof
But that’s broad top
Burn the bread, call it pop tart
When I’m in the mall, the nigga shop a cart
Got a U-hog in the parking lot

[Hook]
