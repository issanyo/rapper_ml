[Hook: Kent Jones]
I get it 365, 12 months, 24/7
Gotta get it, I need it steady Fight me
No one give it out like you
They don’t love us, they just loving how we live, how we live, how we live
They don’t love us, they just loving how we live, how we live, how we live
See, they don’t love us, they just loving how we live, how we live
How we live, how we live, how we live
How we live, how we live, how we live
How we living, how we living
They don’t love us, they just loving how we live

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
You was never round, had to hold it down
We the youngest, we was thuggin’, you was never found
What’s that feelin’? I’m the realest
All ’em nights I had to struggle tryna find some dinner
They don’t really love me, they not really for me
When I die is you gon’ show up to the ceremony?
I just bought a Bentley just to [?]
Bet you Christian Louboutin’ll make her switch religion
I’m not stupid, baby, but the mansion is
Me and Benji are related like we relatives
I’m a [?], brought the millions in
Go and get it, I’m the shit, I don’t need no laxatives

[Hook]
I get it 365, 12 months, 24/7

They don’t love us, they just loving how we live, how we live, how we live

How we live, how we live, how we live
How we live, how we live, how we live

[Verse 2: Vado]
Uh, they say in due time, but my watch broke
It‘s a cold world, but we got coats
We grindin’ to make it, we shinin’, they hatin'
We ball 'til we fall, every dime is a flagrant
I’m signed to the pavement, I’m crossin’ em over
I’m backin ’em down, standing tall like a soldier
These players can’t hold us, it’s the winners’ race
Eating with Kent and Ace at a table, no dinner plates
We the best, get it straight! What’s the problem, baby?
Raised outta Harlem, baby, was driving my momma crazy
They ain’t tryna give it, so I gotta go get it, harder than ever to live it

[Hook]
I get it 365, 12 months, 24/7
Gotta get it, I need it steady Fight me
No one give it out like you

They don’t love us, they just loving how we live, how we live, how we live
See, they don’t love us, they just loving how we live, how we live
How we live, how we live, how we live
How we live, how we live, how we live
How we living, how we living
They don’t love us, they just loving how we live

[Bridge: Kent Jones]
Have faith in many but put your trust in nobody
Yeah! I said, have faith in many but put your trust in nobody
Have faith in many but put your faith in nobody
I done been around, halfway round the globe, probably
Still ain’t met nobody that see it picture perfect
We all buy lies, depends on the purchase
You can’t walk a mile in my shoes cause I’m steady runnin’
Like water can’t break, unless it’s by a pregnant woman
So I had to earn life, road to the riches
Wouldn’t change it for the turnpike

[Hook]
I get it 365, 12 months, 24/7
Gotta get it, I need it steady Fight me
No one give it out like you
They don’t love us, they just loving how we live, how we live, how we live
They don’t love us, they just loving how we live, how we live, how we live
See, they don’t love us, they just loving how we live, how we live
How we live, how we live, how we live
How we live, how we live, how we live
How we living, how we living
They don’t love us, they just loving how we live

[Outro]
How we live, how we live, how we live
How we live, how we live, how we live
How we living, how we living
They don’t love us, they just loving how we live
How we live
