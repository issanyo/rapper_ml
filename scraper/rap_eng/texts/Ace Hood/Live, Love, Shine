[Chorus]
I feel good, I got life
I got love so I'm aight
Keep your faith, it's okay
You'll be fine, you'll be straight
Get back up ay, right back up ay
Can't give up ay, can't give up ay
I feel good, I got life
I got love so I'm aight

[Verse 1]
I'm gon' rough
I got stripes
I am him
It's no hype
Raise that bar
Raise that price
Find your way
Through your life
Do your best, ay
To invest, ay
To collect, ay
To protect, ay
Everything that you built
What it took to get here?
How you think it get chills
Break it down and rebuild
I'm three blessed
Way too blessed
But in these booth
I'm possessed
Don't you worry
Don't you stress
I see my ex
I wish her best
I'm on that yacht
I'm on my block
I'm in that draw
I'm out that draw
Do lil yoga
I like that hot
Please don't stop
In my spot

[Chorus]
I feel good, I got life
I got love so I'm aight
Keep your faith, it's okay
You'll be fine, you'll be straight
Get back up ay, right back up ay
Can't give up ay, can't give up ay
I feel good, I got life
I got love so I'm aight, woo

[Verse 2]
I woke up today and I feel great, I talking super blessed
I just got to say I curved the faith, worked through my euro steps
I say thank you Jesus, Lamborghini, fuck yo Christmas list
I can really call it, once you baling ain't no sportsmanship
Never get way too low, I never get way too high
Looking inside my fears that really made me rise
Please don't kill my vibe, please don't kill my vibe
Everything cool with a nigga like me until you cross that line
Man, they can't move when the streets like us
It's a must, you pay that fine
Niggling dimes that's what I started with
Back when Tha Carter hit
Wake up the zone
One of the element
Black is the elegance
I wanna shine, go where you never been
Do what you never did
Do it again
I know the feeling of win
I want it never to end
I'm on ten
I'm on hen
Running broads
Making plays
Again
No excuses
Work the juices

[Chorus]
I feel good, I got life
I got love so I'm aight
Keep your faith, it's okay
You'll be fine, you'll be straight
Get back up ay, right back up ay
Can't give up ay, can't give up ay
I feel good, I got life
I got love so I'm aight, woo
