(Hook) Ace Hood & Lil Wayne
I made my way from the bottom
And I'm grinding
I wake up every morning looking for commas, by my dollars
I'm going all out and that's on my mamma
Cause we outchea
We outchea
Ain't no sleeping cause we outchea
We outchea
We outchea
Grinding all Damn night cause we outchea
(Verse 1: Craker Boyyy)
All these people hating on me
I wake up in the sky
Look it's martians cause they be out there yeah
We outchea really boy you come for me???
I wanna see your face, man bump for me
Baby girl dance
Baby girl Lance
These boys hating on me cause they wanna rant
Rancid odor
Shoot your pants
All these people in their house they wanna dance
See me see me in they house
See me see me in they blouse
Just kidding I don't wear woman's clothing
I wanna see them, go hard
Peace out to my homies all the way in boulevard

Grinding all Damn night cause we outchea
