Starvation

[Verse One]
Uhh
Feeling like I done been crucified
Haven't been the same since my daughter died
Paranormal flourished in my state of mind
Kind of hard for me to orchestrate a fuckin' rhyme
Last night I took some painkillers
And I became friends with a death dealer
Couple minutes later I was stupid numb
Slowly blinking thinking where I got this pistol from
Damn, I was fucked up
Still wondering why my daddy had abandoned us
Lost my dog when he decided to put them hammers up
Left the dope game so crackers couldn't jam him up
Hidden pain off in my cold heart
These niggas playing foul like a false start
Have my youngest pull your card like it's Hallmark
Choppers stoppin' niggas like a crossguard

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Oh Lord I'm a mad man
Screamin' Starvation to the motherland
Never money over brothers man
And I don't think they understand
Hear the pain as my soul pour
It's like the Lions when the Pack roared
Come meet the last of a dying breed
Guarantee that its some shit you never seen
Black man no college degree
Still I made a way for my mama to eat
Million dollars made and I did it in peace
But still I am a threat to the fuckin police
I forever be a field nigga
As long as God with me I'm gon' deal with 'em
Paranoia that only Lord knows
I think I'm seeing people in the Phantom Ghost

[Hook]
