[Verse]
I put the Porsche in them inches, that be the photo addition
I keep a bitch in the kitchen, the ass sitting ridiculous
This the Mission, chains all vintage
Came to buy the club boy fuck who in attendance
Doc just called man told me find a clinic
Swag so sick aids when I go to spitting
Man I'm different, yeah nigga different
Ride 28's on the Chevy fuck 26's
Every summer ball while you watching on the benches
Got a sewed up rap game, need the stitches
Top off the Jeep man that motherfucker senseless
Hottest in the streets please tell em' bare with this
Chris Paul on this bullshit no Pippen
Crossover crossover fade away instant
When he done you gon' rock them ankles like Christmas
Might alley-oop guess who? Blake Griffin
Man y'all tripping, money is the mission
All-Star week ball player and some bitches
Or I mean women, Lord knows I'm sinning
She can't believe the watch, I told her watch Ripley's
All-Star weekend
Woman everywhere decisions
I tell em ball on a hater
Penthouse marble floors two elevators
I'm gone
