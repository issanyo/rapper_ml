[Intro]
Yeah
(Everything Foreign Nigga)
Passion
Whole lotta passion
(Woo!)

[Chorus]
Passion
If I don't do nothing else, but you gon' love me for my passion
If I don't do nothing else, bitch I'm gon' go secure the bag then
I put my heart and my soul and this I told you this a fact'n
Fuck on my bitch, fuck on my bitch
Like when we kiss I feel the...

[Verse 1]
Passion, love, pain
I give it all to the game
Everyone in it to gain
Blessed up, blessed up, that's us, yes I praise
Live-by, die-by, ride-a la-la blazin'
Fuck it, I'm outta' the cage
Youngin', a heart of the brave
Switchin', I'm flippin' the page
Ain't no more minimum wage
I gotta get it, eat it baby
Been on some, fuck a nigga lately
Runnin' on no sleep, 'cause I'm too deep in my dreams, he's crazy
I want it all dawg, I'm a ball-hog, Kobe-ing, all ya'll hate me
I heard the smalltalk from the fuckboys, wanna [?]
[?] for this
Gave my life for this
I'm too confident, I'm too great with this
We talkin'...

[Chorus]
Passion
If I don't do nothing else, but you gon' love me for my passion
If I don't do nothing else, bitch I'm gon' go secure the bag then
I put my heart and my soul and this I told you this a fact'n
Fuck on my bitch, fuck on my bitch
Like when we kiss I feel the...

[Verse 2]
Passion
Silencing all the madness
Cr-crafting, whipping up nothing but magic
Practice, niggas been talkin' 'bout practice
Money all under the mattress, plaques are still in the plastic
Livin' with niggas, imagine
P-pull up with one of the baddest
I never ever been average
Don't be so fuckin' dramatic
I want them more, More Life
They want your soul for a price
I done made plenty of sacrifices
I want to walk in the lighter crisis
When the Lord's gotta' roll the dice
Niggas tryin' be the prototype
I just wanna get to know you better
That's the thought I'm thinking when I'm in the mirror
Niggas slippin' like it's been a drip
Legendary niggas runnin' still
When I'm dead, when I'm gone
Pray my name still livin' on
Now feel me

[Chorus]
Passion
If I don't do nothing else, but you gon' love me for my passion
If I don't do nothing else, bitch I'm gon' go secure the bag then
I put my heart and my soul and this I told you this a fact'n
Fuck on my bitch, fuck on my bitch
Like when we kiss I feel the... (passion)

[Outro]
Fuck on my bitch, fuck on my bitch
Like when we kiss I feel the passion (hey)
Fuck on my bitch, fuck on my bitch
Like when we kiss I feel the passion
Fuck on my bitch, fuck on my bitch
Like when we kiss I feel the passion
I gave my heart to this game
I gave my heart to this game
