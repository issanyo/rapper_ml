[Verse 1]
Young black nigga in America succesful
I am what you call good looking imperfection
Living in this thing called life it'll test you
Ain't too many people you can call that'll rescue
This is another story 'bout a black man
Nigga please you about to get a back end
Tried to tell them I was comin' from a back then
I tried to tell them most these niggas they are stagnate
I need that motivation 'round me all the time
I need that inspiration working in the mind
Look out for vultures they be lurking on you shine
I like my [?] on the rocks I had a lime
I'm in Atlanta politicking with my [?]
I told them we gon' whip 'em up another dose
I'm doing this for all my niggas on the go-go
Take care of your people they the ones you need the most-ost
[?] anybody feel like perfect timing
I need atleast a seven figures if I sign it
You know I'm chocolate I look lovely in my diamonds
I'm kinda freaky mixed the [?] with some bondage

[Hook]
I'm on my way I feel like Rocky Balboa
You niggas keep on playing chess I'm playing poker
Too many hits I start to feel like Sammy Sosa
I heard they talkin' 'bout a boy and now I'm global
I heard they tryna' rep the game but we don't know them
And we don't know them, they open [?]
Well I'm the chosen, yeah I'm the chosen
I'm the chosen, I'm the chosen

[Verse 2]
Okay now this another story 'bout a black man
Nigga please your CD go in the trash can
I'm overseas a quarter M on a back end
I can't believe the shit they type in they caption
I'm on a mission with a vision it's alive
It's on my momma we gon' rock up every dime
Left me for dead they never thought I would survive
I double back we powered up oh they suprised
I feel like fuck all these niggas none of them fuckin with me
I'm talkin' Kobe, Lebrom mix in a 2 and a 3
I turned a thought to a dream into a tangible thing
Monetizing my gifts until the transition agreed
And they gon' hate that, oh well, peep the details
Nigga ballin' like a Sprewell, you just a [?]
Catching plays like Odell that's probably [?]
Told you niggas from the get go I'm giving them hell

[Hook]
I'm on my way I feel like Rocky Balboa
You niggas keep on playing chess I'm playing poker
Too many hits I start to feel like Sammy Sosa
I heard they talkin' 'bout a boy and now I'm global
I heard they tryna' rep the game but we don't know them
And we don't know them, they open [?]
Well I'm the chosen, yeah I'm the chosen
I'm the chosen, I'm the chosen
