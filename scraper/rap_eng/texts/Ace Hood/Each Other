[Hook: Ace Hood]
We ain't had no pot to piss in
We had struggles everyday
Mama said hit your knees and pray
Can't go back gotta find a way
We had nothing, we had each other
I had my sisters, I had my brothers
I had my dogs, I had my folks, I had my mama
We ain't had nothing, we had each other
Free, free, free

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Never forget all the tough times
Never forget all the fun times
Used to link up at the stop sign
Typical day in the sunshine
We used to play in the dead end
Me and the homies was flocking
I used to dream of the NFL
I used to look up to Emmitt Smith
I used to pray for the latest J's
But know I was happy with any gift
Stayed round the corner from Angelina
She was that shorty with pretty lips
I was the young and hard head
See the police and we all ran
I member mama was stressed out
Passed through bills in the trash can
I seen them tears dropping on the pretty face
I could never forget it
Started praying in the ends
I'm just prayin' and I'm wishing
I just wanna get a bag, tell my mama she ain't working for a living
Plenty people got to witness
Reemerging of the vision
We used to dream about it
Now the reality real
I got some scars for life
I know I never could heal
Stories I never will tell
We gon' forever prevail
All of the money in the world
Ain't worth the bond that we share

[Hook: Ace Hood]
We ain't had no pot to piss in
We had struggles everyday
Mama said hit your knees and pray
Can't go back gotta find a way
We had nothing, we had each other
I had my sisters, I had my brothers
I had my dogs, I had my folks, I had my mama
We ain't had nothing, we had each other
Free, free, free

[Verse 2: Scotty ATL]
I ain't even got more time
Never met more outside
All of my grandparents died
Fore I could even meet recipes
All my cousins in Arkansas
Write a book bout what I done saw
Shadow arise in the city
Gotta run round with a stick
Me and my brother stayed home
My mama working two jobs
Get it, where I got my hustle
Pushing away, got muscles
Wanna bank like Russel, like mineclaw, like luse
Family ainâ€™t just blood, loyalty is rare, who the closest to you
Stupid soft from a pot
I want family over us
I gotta shout out my mama
She held a young nigga down
Birthday was the worst day
Now I love seeing you smile
We always been all we got
Can't wait to buy you the drop

[Hook: Ace Hood]
We ain't had no pot to piss in

We ain't had nothing, we had each other
Free, free, free
