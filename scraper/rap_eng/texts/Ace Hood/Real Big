[Verse 1]
Niggas ain’t shit, hoes ain’t either
We just tryna fuck it while you steady tryna keep her
Spot that ass like a cheetah, Kray you know I see you
Speak into my mic and you’ll be added as a feature
So you say your name’s Tamica, black and Puerta Rica
It’s really nice to meet you, ass fatter than Serena
I should serve you West Sepina, deliver you the penis
It’s mister do it bigger than them niggas with a Visa
Call her beamer ballerina, it’s tipping through the city
Got hundreds and them 50s ever pocket of them Vickeys
Bout my bread like I’m Jiffy, V S O P Remy
Bitch I do it bigger than an 18 wheeler semi
That’s that Broward County in me
Hottest nigga simply
All these diamonds on me it done got a nigga trembling
Bitch I do it real big, diamonds real big
I show you how to do it, pay me close attention

[Hook]
Ok my plane just landed
Still on that fly shit
Every dollar made, got to save for that high stitch
Ask me what I’m on and I tell em get rich
Nothing for them bitches they get only this dick
Now how we do it (real big)
Now how we do it (real big)
How we roll (real big)
Bitch I do it real big

[Verse 2]
Ok now big is how I got to do
Riding on them double deuce
Pistol on my lap, you run up on me get your inner view
Bitches they so gullible, you see what the seven do
I just lost the top like earning beads at a festival
Back up in it, what it do
I am so ahead of you
Oh I mean ahead of y’all, fly nigga protocol
Flying in that double R, cooling with that other broad
Kick her to the curb I hear she going through her peri-yard
Man I can’t stand it, flyest on my campus
See a nigga swag all in like the Hamptons
Talk about the money and how I can go expand it
Understand it, million dollar standards
No tool box, but rolling with the hammer
Straight bars, ain’t talking bout the slammer
Nigga sleep, poke your ass, I’m your pajamas
I’m a star, bitch go and get your camera

[Hook]
