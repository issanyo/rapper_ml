I got some real niggas in this bitch
Real niggas big on ride it is
Now who you do it fo’?

[Hook]
I do it for the streets, the people, the haters, we need ‘em
The ones who done been doubtin’ and turned them folks in believers
For the struggle, the hustle, my momma, I love you
I taught me how to get it, I got this shit from the muscle
From the block, the gutter, the bottom, we thuggin’
I beat this shit for y’all and I guarantee that they love it
Who you do it fo’?
Now who you do it fo’?

[Verse 1]
If I die tonight just lace me in Versace gear
I pay for all them pussies, and they hating spirit
Hope my casket run me eighty to a hundred thou
Nothing less than lavish how I'm goin' down
Realest nigga and it ain’t up for debation
I do it for them hustlers all over the nation
Look in my eyes, see what I see
I am my brother's keeper, eat what I eat
Word to my momma, bitch I’m tryna die a legend
Pray to god my second home is gon reside in heaven
Pushing that Phantom like it’s a coup
No top on my lady, drop off the roof
Young and I’m thuggin’, blessed in abundance
Whatcha know ‘bout getting money and runnin' the summer
Did it and done it. Bring it, you want it
I got an answer for your question

[Hook]
I do it for the streets, the people, the haters, we need ‘em
The ones who done been doubtin’ and turned them folks in believers
For the struggle, the hustle, my momma, I love you
I taught me how to get it, I got this shit from the muscle
From the block, the gutter, the bottom, we thuggin’
I beat this shit for y’all and I guarantee that they love it
Who you do it fo’?
Now who you do it fo’?

[Verse 2]
I do it for the niggas in the peniten
Who barely see the sun, that’s cuz they doin’ bids
I pray for all you felons away from your kids
Cried through many nights cuz I lost one half of a twin
That’s why I’m livin’ life cuz I might die tomorrow
This watch is disrespectful, I might catch a charge
Pull up on my ex I’m like wudup bitch?
This shit I’m drivin’ cost a quarter fuck a dumb shit
Back on the block, strapped with the Glock
No tint on the Phantom, see what you not
23, only majored in getting money
Do it for the ones who made a way from nothin’
Shout out them dope boys
Shout out you go getters
One for them broke homies, two for the rich niggas
I was a man when my daddy wasn’t
I got an answer for your question

[Hook]
I do it for the streets, the people, the haters, we need ‘em
The ones who done been doubtin’ and turned them folks in believers
For the struggle, the hustle, my momma, I love you
I taught me how to get it, I got this shit from the muscle
From the block, the gutter, the bottom, we thuggin’
I beat this shit for y’all and I guarantee that they love it
Who you do it fo’?
Now who you do it fo’?
Now who you do it fo’?
