[Intro]
3 AM in the morning
Bulletproof

[Chorus]
See the man can't flourish 'cause the hate encouraged
Talking slick 'cause the peace keep purging
G spot tapping though the cash keep coming
Member I was living on my last 3 hundred

[Verse 1]
Member I was trippin', had to eat golden junk
Looking in the mirror like can't keep running
Can't keep running, must come first
Realest nigga living, how I feel these days
Watch a nigga move, how the field get played
Mumble on a track and nigga still get praised?
Funny how I'm sure to never ride ya'll wave
Seven to chevy, doin' fishtails
Waves all choppy like a windmill
I know niggas ballin and they in jail
Harder than you niggas in the free world
Ease here flows for the retail
I'ma make it tough for you to sleep well
Clips come attached like a email
Day you ever played me like a female
Nothing in common with these niggas
There's a big difference in the detail
Your best friend gave the feds intel
L-O-L, L-O-L, L-O-L
Okay, the vision's alive as I reflect on the time
I had a heavy disguise on myself (talk to em)
I'm in this bitch with the 9
I gotta pray all the time
That I won't ever decide to need help (talk to em)
You gotta manage the card that you're dealt
It's hard to really explain what I felt
I lost my nigga before all this money and fame
But I keep placing the blame on myself
Conversations at the crib we go all day
Rich nigga still eat Chiptole
Haters still waiting on the okay
Praying everyday I get my life straight

[Chorus]
See the man can't flourish 'cause the hate encouraged
Talking slick 'cause the peace keep purging
G spot tapping though the cash keep coming
Member I was living on my last 3 hundred

[Verse 2]
Break it all down just build it back up
Step into the booth, it's like I'm going to the trunk
Hard that motherfucker till eyes get slung
I be out the country before the cops dem come
Bullet proof loving on the westside
Nigga raybang on the left side (left side)
Money is the motive, put the game in a choker
Want the spot so a lot put my name on the poster
Funny I got hotter once the flow got colder
Whole world sitting on my got damn shoulders
Had to boss up and take the pay that I hope for
Elevate the mind and the soul of the culture
Watch out
Hear a couple niggas tryna black ball
Way too many niggas on the sack though
Boy, you know you fuckin' with a outlaw
I mean by any means necessary
I ain't stopping till they see a nigga missionary
On top they gon' learn that I'm visionary
I seen the vision, beginning of preliminary
Nigga ready for whenever it's crunch time
Don't give a fuck how niggas feel, I skip the lunch line
I'm way hungrier than niggas on the front line
Lebron James on the finals, boy, I won't mind
I won't mind

[Chorus]
See the man can't flourish 'cause the hate encouraged
Talking slick 'cause the peace keep purging
G spot tapping though the cash keep coming
Member I was living on my last 3 hundred

[Outro]
Member I was trippin', had to eat golden junk
Looking in the mirror like can't keep running
Must come first
