Beast
(Renegade, renegade, renegade)

[Verse]
Uh, I wake up every mornin', thank God, then I gotta get to it
I never had a role model, money was the only influence
While they was talkin' 'bout it in the city, I was really out doin' it
Hundred bands I was 19 and the man, I knew it, okay
That's around the time I shine, had these niggas all hatin'
Same time I was grindin,' same time I was patient
You was standin' with your hand out waitin', yeah yeah
I'ma keep it real, how it feel? I don't give 2 fucks
Count another bag on the road, I could never get enough
They wanna hang when I'm on, where they were when the shit got tough?
And what a nigga think about me? I don't give 2 fucks
You don't pay my bills, you don't feed my kids, your opinion don't matter
My pockets still gettin' fatter
God damn and the last time I looked in the mirror, I was starin' at a real one
And fuck makin' friends, where the ends at? 'Cause all my dogs need a million
I don't give a fuck about poppin' no bottles in the club
I'm focused on the money, I ain't never goin' back the way I was
A lot of people asked why I drive it here then it get missin'
Sorry to my fans, I'll be way more consistent
Haters get the middle finger, Lord be the witness, listen
Got a crib out west in the spot out in Cali, waiting for me when I touch down
Fired my old jeweler, went and got a new jeweler, made him already do the bust-down
I thinks it's funny how they wanna be down, all of a sudden young nigga gettin' up now
Yeah, king of the city, nigga, king of the state, turn beast when the sun down
I'm just really havin' fun now
Funny how that slick talk minimize when ya boy 'round
I just landed in the UK, in a suite with a pretty little freak sippin' D’Ussé
Murda, murda in the booth, ayy
I'm a killer on the beat, increasin' the crime rate
I need a mill, not an entrée
I need a Jay, no Beyoncé
Smokin' like a choo train
Showin' niggas how to do things
Boys bitin' on the flow, I changed up like a mood ring
Young nigga with a new flame
Don't compare me to no mane
Top of the food chain, uh
