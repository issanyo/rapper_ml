[Ace Hood]

[Hook]
Okay I stepped off in this mothafucka
Bankroll on me! (On me!)
Feelin' myself, got a couple chains on me (Woo!)
See I Think I'm the shit, you should think the same
Swaggin' with a ?, bet those bitches know my name
Cuz I walk it like I talk
Depends how I said it? Them other niggas stompin'!
I'm out here gettin' fed
Cuz I walk it like I talk it, walk it like I talk it
Not long before I cop it, now it's off the market

[Verse 1]
More money; more problems
Just bring me my dollas!
See I'm 'bout my feddy, paper chasin' scholar
Those diamonds on my wrist, more ? my collar
Swag is on that *long ugly sound*, talkin' that Chewbaka!
I pull up in that (?), hoppin' out with them models
Handlin' with the mobbers, they might have some type of choppas
I'll tell you how to ?, watch what you be sayin'!
Walk it like I talk, I'm focused on the bands
I pull up to any club, you already know (Know!)
There goes Mr. Hood, just don't check him at the door
Got that (?), oh I think I'm fly
"Bitch you know I is," that's exactly my reply

[Hook]
K.R. stepped off in this motherfucker
Bankroll on me! (On me!)
Feelin' myself, got a couple chains on me (Woo!)
See I think I'm the shit (The shit!), and you should think the same
I'm swaggin' with them all, bet those bitches know my name!
Cuz I walk it like I talk
Depends how I say it, them other niggas startin'!
I'm out here gettin' fed
Cuz I walk it like I talk it, walk it like I talk it
Wanna bet I cop it; no longer on the market

[Verse 2]
I'm too raw for you bitches
Livin' what you wishin'
?
?
You should see me when I'm ?
Sippin' on my lil' potion
Had them bitches buggin', yeah I'm talkin' roaches
Cuz I walk it like I talk
Cop it if I like, wanna bet I get her whether super straight or dyke
That pussy's like some nitrus
Bet I'm gettin' mad, swaggin' off in the Jag; the top peelin' back!
Just to make em mad! Another paper tag
I'm so down for the talkin', ?
What you sayin'?
Okay we ain't talkin' 'bout paper!
You can kindly kiss my ass
