[Verse]
My money late there’s no explanation, no conversation
Just confrontation, they never safe, it's no combination
That chopper handle your accommodations
On beast mode and my new flow is like C-4
And that’s abomination, I’m dedicated
I’m levitated this shit I’m smokin’ they medicated
Shoot pussy niggas, you’ll never try me, your mom and them would be devastated
Run around with them young niggas, them thirty pistols ain’t registrated
They rob niggas and love beef, they sneakin’ out when they mom sleep
They switchin’ whips and they bustin’ licks and they love to ride to that Chief Keef
I'm back up on to my bullshit fresh up off of that pulpit
Say a prayer for the naysayers, y’ll better know who y’ll fuckin’ with
Get in line for that summer time, cause this summer’s mine
Just better recognize, bad bitches on big yachts
And they do whatever, thats for the Vine
These hoes be gassin’ niggas, now all of a sudden they talkin’ crazy
Niggas thuggin’ on internet, until we on they corner like Champ Bailey
Instagram, and don’t give a damn, when that plucker blamming they can’t save them
All I heard was “Oh Lord Jesus” they still bleeding that boy baby
Illest you know it, I’m switching the flow
They see the glow when I walk through the door
Money the motive, I’m grippin’ the loaders, I’m holding the focus you know it for sure
I body whatever, beast nigga, Rappers on my plate now that's a feast nigga (that's a feast nigga)
Rappers on my plate now that's a feast nigga (now, that's a feast nigga)
Rappers on my plate now that's a feast nigga (beast nigga)
Ain't no games, my new shit is on the way
See y'all niggas better tighten up
Cause we weeks out, a few days away
