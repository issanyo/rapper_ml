[Verse 1]
You know I'm gon' hop up on this beat and catch a body bag
Body bag zip it up and toe tag
Chopper knock a nigga out his mustache
Shit too easy I ain't even in my duff bag
Started out of Broward this lil thing of ours
Blowing on that sour pistol on the counter
That sucker shit for cowards money and the power
Ooouuu I love that shuffle sound with money counters
Ooouuu I got her wet just like the water fountain
Ouh I been the best before I thought about it
It's still fuck'em ain't apologizing
Still fuck em ain't apologizing
It's faith in me alive that's how I beat the odds
My physical physique is on some Greek [?]
People will mistreat you had to cut the ties
We are nothing equal quit with these facades
Mean that I don't see you when you switching sides
Loyalty ain't shit if it's incentivized
Reason why my circle done got minimized
Who behind them tints, you can't identify
Couples zoe's with me they uncivilized
Chain lighting up like it was Christmas time
Hol' up, Lamborghini doors up
Jesus pieces froze up, keep the demons far from me
Bitches I'm gon' call some, they just think I'm awesome
Balmain denims with the Yeezy's how I sauced 'em
Imma give her pipe like the whip til' she exhausted
Now she runnin' like a faucet, Ooouuu
Ooouuu
Yo mane whatup, Broward
