[Hook]
Once you find it do not let that feeling go
Look into her mind besides her physical
See what you can find inside that envelope
We just gotta love ourselves a lil bit more
Do not make that thread if you not with the smoke
Do not sign a line if you don't pray before
Money ain't gon' keep no realer woman broke
We just got to love ourselves a lil bit more

[Verse]
I'm creating life and I feel great about it
Know I found my wife, it's no mistake about it
Speaking in existence, one must visualise it
Fear inside of me, I try to venomise it
Life I give thanks, make my way down to the bank
I don't give a flying fuck 'bout what you think or got to say
Paid the grip, to trip the rolley, I don't have no time to wait
I do everything for love but all the friendly shit I hate (Sak Pase)
