[Intro]
God, family, my fans, and the money is the only thing that count, nigga
You dig?

[Chorus]
Get a deposit
Then I divide it
We never had it
So I provide it
I never stress
Nigga, you blessed
But that don't mean I won't do things that I'll regret

[Verse 1]
For all of my niggas who kept it 100, I feel I'm in debt
For all of my people who back in my city, I got a connect
I'm a survivor
Little more wiser
Lining my chakras, 3rd eye monster
I'm on a new level, it's a loose rebel
To the Dom P from a wine cellar
Got an upgrade on the time-teller
Got some Vans on, not the Margiella's
Need a pallbearer, kill a nigga with a 16
Flow came with a Windchiller, need a chinchilla, nigga, too cold
Truth told in the rap game, I am Von Miller, nigga, beastmode
Fuck a nigga with them fake feelings, like they been with us
Ya'll weirdos
Bitch, I know I been the greatest
You ain't gotta state it, I'ma let the work show
Told Meek Milly backstage, I'ma charge in through the front door
Facts nigga

--

We gon' get that bag
Hefty sack, nigga

[Chorus]
Get a deposit
Then I divide it
We never had it
So I provide it
I never stress
Nigga, you blessed
But that don't mean I won't do things that I'll regret

[Bridge]
I can't forget about them times when I was broke
I can't forget about my dawgs and all my folks
I kept my trust and kept my faith when they lost hope
I kept me focus, no emotions, ain't gon' show

[Verse 2]
Look at me now, I'm full grown
'Nother shoulder with a chip on
Wack rappers in the kill zone
Predatory, get you prayed on
Niggas layin' on your momma' home while I'm flying in another time zone
We ain't talkin' money, get the dial tone
I've been meditating, got the mind strong
And I can't forget about my woes and my lil' bro
I had some friend who switched up sides and they got ghost
And I had hoes, was on my line, was doing the most
I've been though hell, but you can't tell the way I glow

[Chorus]
Get a deposit
Then I divide it
We never had it
So I provide it
I never stress
Nigga, you blessed
But that don't mean I won't do things that I'll regret

[Bridge]
I can't forget about them times when I was broke
I can't forget about my dawgs and all my folks
I kept my trust and kept my faith when they lost hope
I kept my focus, no emotions, ain't gon' show

[Outro]
Agh!
3 Bless
God, family, my fans, and the money, it's the only thing that count
Dig that!
