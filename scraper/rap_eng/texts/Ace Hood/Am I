[Dizzy]
Am I the fucking shit
Am I just what you need
Am I the inspiration
Am I just here to please
Yeah I am (x8)
Am I the best you know
Am I holding it down
Ain't I solely the only holder of this crown
Yeah I am (x8)

Am I stuck in a rut, no, I am never gutter ball
Flows is prepared until golden like a butter ball
As for being like me, Never find another yall
I am legend, A league that you ain't in at all
Taking this up to new heights I swear
I don’t care if they stare, I kinda like that there
I’m a young debonair pushing a whip visually impaired
Due to all that purple shit we’ve been putting in the air
Am I
Doin it so G, While keeping it low key
I’m so environmental, Saving paper and growing trees
You hear me doing TI saying you don’t know me
Try approaching me for shit bitch
You can blow me
Am I
Too fucking smart
Or just
Somewhat retarded
Either way, Dizzy always gonna finish what he started
That’s why I’m sticking with this, Hate my ambition if you wish
Put your love into what you do, How could you not get rich?

They like oh my god its Dizzy, Got Go Gettas who with me
And ho’s they in abundance, And so we getting busy
Got Grizz up on the tables, Got G up in the booth
Ace Hood pulling up outside new coupe
Got Jay he in my section along with a selection
I ain't talking bout rubbers when I say I got protection
I am, up in the building
I am, the one you feeling
I am, so titillating your girl says I’m fulfilling
Am I, crossing the line
Am I, the one who made it
Am I, sounding so fine
Ain't you, the one who faded
Ain't you, the mother fucker who said I wouldn’t make it
And yet I demonstrated how cities get dominated
Ain't I, the one and only
Ain't I, numero uno
Didn’t I make a come-up while moving weight like a sumo
Ain't you, the one who curious
Ain't you, checking on Dizzy
And I’m, just letting know you’re gonna wanna ride with me

[Ace Hood]
I am my brother’s keeper you people sleeping on me though
Hopping out of that beamer, with blood up under my sneakers
Those are red bottoms don’t do the Prada they’re sick a gonorrhea
Real you know the deal my safe is holding a mil
Still repping the field I hang like Emmett Till
Fuck alotta these hoes, my girl is with me still
I am
You niggas not
Fresh off the block took my advance went and bought a drop
Cuz I’m the shit and you can smell it from a mile away
Bow down mañana paper pounds Benjamin Franks
Gotta get this money, fuck them bitches that just by the way
I’m probably somewhere in your city nigga getting paid
Cuz I am that nigga
I am that boy, Am I fucking your girl
I had no choice, Her head game sick
That pussy so moist, I hit them then I leave
Tell them to send an invoice, yep Hood
