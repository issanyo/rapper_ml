[Hook]
From the south to the west to the east to the north
It go off, it go off

[Verse 1: Reek Da Villian]
Blowin Cubanas in Honda Sonatas with Madonnas
As she do the honors to shine and polish my anaconda
I'm at the Ramada like Tony Montana with my llama
Countin' Angelatas, sippin' pina colada cavadas
These giuliani illuminati, my super shotty
These dudes'll try me with Deuteronomy, my Ruger body
And my True Armani's, I'm prolly with a new crew of mami's
'Bout to make a punani tsunami in a blue Bugatti
Flow's phenomenal, money on amadu
Diablo chronicles, rap from Elvis Presley's abdominal
Niggas is comical, tryna pair up with the shit I'ma do
Gravity rappin' fall on deaf ears, I'm astronomical
Like a jungle, sometimes that makes me wonder
How I keep from goin' under, survivin' all of these summers
And runnin' from gunners, hoppin' out Hummers with Stevie Wonders
That don't even look at who they be shootin' when they be dumpin'

[Hook]
From the south to the west to the east to the north
It go off, it go off

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I slay a nigga with no conscience, I'm so Compton
I know your confidence, you're incompetent, that's a compliment
Any continent, I can construct atomic condiments
I'm not a Communist, rather govern my own accomplishments
Livin' in turmoil boils my temper
Tempurpedic'll burn if you sleep on me, nigga
Jimmy crack corn and Kendrick can crack the horns
Of a dragon and toss 'em inside of a bush full of thorns
Taggin' along, get you thrown on side of your lawn
Throw a molotov, I toss, catch it like a baton, boss
Acquire many choirs for your funeral
Be quiet before I stand over you like a urinal
Mark a bullet wherever your latest rapper tattoo'll go
Your crew'll know I split you 'til you was two adults
Siamese, I sneeze and bless tracks
You a bitch on menopause, I ain't gotta pause that
Bitch

[Hook]
From the south to the west to the east to the north
It go off, it go off

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Okay now boom shakalaka, Mr. Know-I-Got-A-Lotta
Talkin' dollars, Gucci, Louis, Prada, hundred 'round the collar
Hop up out of that new foreign auto, with the latest model
Tell the waiter bring the bottles, I be stuntin' so they follow
This a treat, and I'm finna feast, why they send the beat?
Come and see, Hannibal the beast, murder, third degree
I assassinated, flow abominated, know they highly hated
Look how it's orchestrated, hottest nigga underrated
They stealin' flows, got these rappers so intimidated
New flow, new dough, boy you outdated
I'm just gettin' started, they ain't seen nothin' yet
Wait 'til my new drops at the projects
See my sneaks, they ain't comin' into stock yet
Got the whole hood hooked, no Pyrex
Stay tuned, rose gold on the Rolex
I'm the best, nigga, period - Kotex

[Hook]
From the south to the west to the east to the north
It go off, it go off

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Midwest, where you at?
Dirty South, where you at?
And anywhere you from
It's where you at, right now
It's that time again
It's that time again
