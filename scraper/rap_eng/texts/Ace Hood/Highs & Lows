[Intro]
My lows, getting high to disguise my lows!
Mr Hood!
My lows, getting high to disguise my lows!
I remember that!
Alright!

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Moment of silence for the ceremony
And for whomever wishing bad on me
Bet you’re wishing was here, ah ha homie
And to the women who diss me, kiss the kicks on me!
Now I’m doing you big, I Tried to warn you
While they was hating and contemplating my downfall
I was in offices making offers on phone calls
While they would rather see me under like a groundhog
I’m about to blast off, feeling like NASA
I couldn’t picture this, how much the frame costs?
Remember hard times? Momma can’t walk
I used to sit in my room to cry the pain off!
I’m aiming for the highs, made it through the lows
Left my old team, made it to the pros!
Momma, look at your son, he got this kinda’ glow
You just be ready when I come and tell you it's time to go

[Hook: Wrekonize & Bernz]
Getting high to disguise my lows!
Yeah, yeah!
Getting high cause it’s all that I know!
Yeah, yeah!
Getting high to disguise my lows!
Every night fly high and it goes!
My highs, my lows!
Getting high to disguise my lows!

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Yeah, you could say I’m comfortably numb
Pen and paper, but the paper is usually for the bud
Forget the moments when I find myself at lost of love
Chasing this money got me dancing to the devil’s drum
Drinking the devil’s rum, set up to lose but one
Except the along way I ended up where I begun
How I'mma be the type to up and run
When everything I am is deep inside these lyrics that I forge in blood
To some I’m simply scum, others a lazy bum
I’m everything you want, but nothing to you all at once
Some of you faker than a hipster with some gold fronts
Don’t say I blame you, you ain’t the only one under their thumb
Roll it up to light it up
Yeah! Closing my eyes as soon as I feel high enough!
Feel like I’m safer blowing smoke, than giving a fuck!
That’s how it goes, getting high untill it stop

[Hook]
Getting high to disguise my lows!
Yeah, yeah!
Getting high cause it’s all that I know!
Yeah, yeah!
Getting high to disguise my lows!
Every night fly high and it goes!
My highs, my lows!
Getting high to disguise my lows!

[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
Paratrooper training, parachuting out in Paris
Clouds underneath my DCs, I’m living lavish!
Sky walking like the world don’t matter
Till my chute won't open, and my domes all shattered
Ego on that G6, falling down on me quick
Was eagle on that steep cliff
Now nemo feeling sea-sick!
This game's a vain thing, so many can’t hang
I seen them hustle hard and end up hearing bang bang!
This trip gon' take a while kids
Pack your sodas! Some nights I’m strapped to go
And other feeling agoraphobic!
Roll it all up, and now I’m on my Whiz Khalifa
You bring my house down and I'll call you Queen Latifah
Find yourself a heaven and an angel you can hold
They say the world is ending, but we really never know!
I trust the ground below me, but it’s always moving slow
So in case you need me now I

[Hook]
Getting high to disguise my lows!
Getting high cause it’s all that I know!
Getting high to disguise my lows!
Every night fly high and it goes!
My highs, my lows!
Getting high to disguise my lows!
