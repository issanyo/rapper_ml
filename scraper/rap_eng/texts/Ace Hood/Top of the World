[Intro]
Ace
See, now I know who I am
'Lotta people thought I couldn't do this...but, uhm
I'm here now, I swear I made it off my block
Ma, I love ya!
I tell 'em, dollas and deals, we did it
If you think I can't do it, hahah, listen

[Hook]
Take a look at me now, I'm from the gutter but I made it
I made it to the top of the world
Nothing holding me down, I told the haters I would make it
I made it to the top of the world

[Verse 1]
Congratulations all you fakers as you see I graduated
Here's a favor for you haters, kiss my anus boy
I made it out the ghetto, I made it out the gutter
But still I keep it street and now I'm hot as every summer
They said I couldn't do it, but who were they to call?
I started rapping and ended chances of playing ball
And now they doubted, but Young is sprouting above them all
Straight out the Broward County gutter skipping menopause
No homo I keep it solo but I will never fall
Now every call that I get the money is so involved
Two stacks or better, it's easy cheddar to hit the mall
I get the money to throw up, so every day I ball

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And yes I made it, you can't mistake it, I know they hate it
They see my face in them papers next to they rapping favorites
I'm so amazing, I am no one like I'm in the Matrix
And I made it momma, don't stress your problems, I'mma get us out of
Forget the drama that people holler, just follow God up
And he will lead you right through them problems I promise momma
And I swear that to the day I perish
Tell them Khaled I will bury every necessary cat who said I wouldn't homie
Look at me now yeah, I'm laughing at you non-believers
And screaming "Gutta!" while I'm balling every fucking season
I used to pass up my CD me and Fo' Fifth in '80
I used to beg them to listen but they were not believing, go

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And as I rap I create a classic, who would imagine
That I would inherit all the traits to be the greatest homie?
The world is mine and everything, get it, let's get the money
See Tony Montana said it best, yes it's quoted truly
So add this song to your list of greatest and classic movies
And I'mma roll the credits just in a second, just get this message
Shout out to everyone who supported me past to present
And I want to thank Khaled cause without him there will be no sessions
And I want to thank fam' cause with them see they taught me this lesson
And I want to thank God cause with out Him there will be no message
And I want to thank all of my fans because they are a blessing
This for BET reference, I got my speech ready

[Hook] x2

[Outro]
Take a look at me
Don't ever let a nigga tell you you can't, my nigga
I've got a lot of diamonds on me right now, but uhm
[?]
See I'm Ace Hood
Before I was just that regular nigga
Dollars and deals, I swear I love ya, homie
Aye, D, I love ya, homie
We gon' do it my nigga
4-5, nigga!
Yeah, You can do whatever you wanna do in this world
My nigga Khaled, we the best music, I'm living proof of that there
He transformed me into the beast you know today
Believe that, Ace Hood
All my hood niggas know what it is
Gutta
