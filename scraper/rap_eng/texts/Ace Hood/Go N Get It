[Intro]
Blood sweat tears
Ace Hood
(I do it)

[Chorus]
Another day, another dollar
Every twenty foe I’m thinking money and the power
Bills due, money runnin low
Plus my cousin lost her mind and had an overdose
Way too many problems got me stressed out
What you’re doing you’ve got seven days to move out
Go n get it, go n get it, go n get it
I’m out here chasin' cream
Go n get it, go n get it, go n get it
Need it by any mean

[Verse 1]
Uh
Money the root of evil guess I’m the devil then
Bag full of dead faces like Afghanistan
Hundred K or better, custom made Beretta's
How about that paper cheddar
Hoppin' out that beamer leather
Tell em get a load of this bezel
Big face and the rocks are pebbles uphill
Don't grind and a nigga don't shine fuck you gotta get mine
Big dawg, big money on my mind
Runnin like to the sun up rise
Money it never sleeps, got bags up under my eyes
Just know I gotta get it mama very sickly plus im expect twin
That's just what heaven sent me
God fearin' nigga this I who in the flesh
Who won't let my people sore
God bless my soul to rest

[Chorus]
Another day, another dollar
Every twenty foe I’m thinking money in the power
Bills due, money runnin low
Plus my cousin lost some money addin over doughs
With so many problems got me stressed up
What you’re doing you’ve got seven days to move at
Go n get it, go n get it, go n get it
I’m out you chasin greens
Go n get it, go n get it, go n get it
Need it by any mean

[Verse 2]
Ok now ridin' round with the rocket
Nigga tryin to steal my flow tho'
Thank you for the promo
We the best will be that logo
Ok back upon my dough shit
Slidin on in them two six
Light's due, car note, baby fees plus rent
Nigga just no doubt no im out chere you
Tote my 9 without fear
Most you niggas pussy, yeah I'm talkin paps smear
Lord guide me as my day go, tryin get my mom on pay roll
And I wanna put her in the benzo
Get kind of hard when the funds low
I’m sick and tired of cryin, Tired of nickels and dimes
Look in her in her eyes but I know your sun gonna rise
Cause I'm a God fearin nigga ‘cause I am in the flesh
Who won't let my family starve god bless my soul to rest

[Chorus]
Another day, another dollar
Every twenty foe I’m thinking money in the power
Bills too, money runnin low
Just my cousin lost some money addin over doughs
With so many problems got me stressed up
What you’re doing you’ve got seven days to move at
Go n get it, go n get it, go n get it
I’m out you chasin greens
Go n get it, go n get it, go n get it
Need it by any mean
