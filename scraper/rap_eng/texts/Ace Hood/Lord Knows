[Intro: Ace Hood]

Dear lord
I understand all the problems I'm about to express to you
Are things you already know
Well here goes nothing

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Dear lord I'm on my knees and I'm begging please
Just guide me father this time I'm really in need
Feeling like I just can't go on mama cry she lost her home
Tears runnin all down the face, judge gave her ten days to be gone
My God what I'm goin do now? So stressed that the day go by
Devil on me and I don't know why, beg mama just please don't' cry
Time get a little rough I know, when I can't give it up I don't
Got twins and they're on the way, see the stars when the... I won't
Sometimes I ask myself will I be a good father
Cause I've never had mine would I give the world to my daughters
Live then you learn, reap what you sow, regardless of wealth grind like you poor

[Hook:]
Man only lord knows what the hell I don't really been through
All the nights I hadn't no food
Dear god tell me what I'm gon do
Man only lord knows all the time I was on my grind
He help what I never could find reach out what I couldn't get a dime
And only lord knows, lord knows lord knows
And only lord knows what the hell I don't really been through
All the nights my mama couldn't move
And all the pain I've put her through
And only lord knows

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
And I'm sick and tired of this pain
Hate the lames in this game only down because of my name
Why switch because of my fame
Lord knows the world where I came, Lord knows the nights that I've cried
Can't help the pain is inside, lord wiped the tears from my eyes
Have I seen the letter of eviction no place to go but you wishin
Got a bless in comin you've lived it yeah dog its all in my vision
I done been through hell and them trenches, I done seen the best of them fall
Lost a couple of my dogs miss them niggas like shit
And it still resides in my heart
Soul hated I'm scarred I'mma do it for... god damn is hard
What the fuck is rapping I really need this shit
Blood sweat and tears I really get it on

[Hook:]
Man only lord knows what the hell I don't really been through
All the nights I hadn't no food
Dear god tell me what I'm gon do
Man only lord knows all the time I was on my grind
He help what I never could find reach out what I couldn't get a dime
And only lord knows, lord knows lord knows
And only lord knows what the hell I don't really been through
All the nights my mama couldn't move
And all the pain I've put her through
And only lord knows

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
And everyday that I wake I grind no time never wait for mine
Still waiting on the day I shine my soul in every part every line
I remember when I had no food lights off bills overdue
Lord knows that I've paid my dues, won't forgive when I had that news
They say my mama sickly thank god she seen her 50's
I pray and ask forgiveness just please lord keep her with me
I was down and now remember that like yesterday middle that struggle break it this year I'm blessed to say
Man this world is so fucked up gas prices is way too high time's hard and I ain't gonna lie
Bust ass to try to get by so who the hell is you all to be judgin'
Man away from literally nothing yeah I'm talkin literally nothing

[Hook:]
Man only lord knows what the hell I don't really been through
All the nights I hadn't no food
Dear god tell me what I'm gon do
Man only lord knows all the time I was on my grind
He help what I never could find reach out what I couldn't get a dime
And only lord knows, lord knows lord knows
And only lord knows what the hell I don't really been through
All the nights my mama couldn't move
And all the pain I've put her through
And only lord knows

[Outro:]
And I thank you jesus for guidin' me, for keeping me
In your name I pray

And only lord knows
