Yo, Don't ever let no one tell you' you can't do anything man, (We Did it) Keep working at it, (And we still going) Yeah, YO!

YO (x4)

It has come to my attention that I move a little quicker, Cause everyday I wake my fan base gets bigger
Wallets getting thicker going step by step, But keep it moving now we started never gonna see me rest
No stress, stayin high off the dense ass nug, Jumping on my oppertunitys like killing a bug
No love for these wanna be thugs that just blush when you call em out for giving you shit they say what? (say what?)
I’m on the top of the world, cause no one fucks with me, and If they did I would probably just let that be
Cause what you see is what you get I guess, striving for the gold hopefully I’ll see that next yes

[Hook]

The one and the only the baddest of bad, yelling out loud like I’m hailing a cab
Making the fads, Chilling with rads, blowing out smoke and we blowin our cash
Kickin it back relaxing, stack hits and we mixing, Sometimes it sounds so clear that I swear I think I must be tripping, listen to the words I write, Going hard like all damn night, Moving far not in those sights, gone now and I’m on my flight, shit I’m still a senior but it’s all good, all good, cause when I’m done my money gone be so good so good. So hood like ace tho, putting them in they’re place tho. thinking of shit i’ll be doing tomorrow my thoughts are now starting to race yo and I stand tall and I pace up, If you wishing it on me I’ll take luck to make bucks not two fucks been giving So listen and

[Hook]

And that's a wrap like..

La La La La La La (x2) I made it to the top of the world .. I made it to the top of the world
