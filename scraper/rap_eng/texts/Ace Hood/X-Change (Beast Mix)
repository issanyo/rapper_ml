[Verse 1: Bryson Tiller]
This what happen when I think about you
I get in my feelings, yeah
I start reminiscing, yeah
Next time around, fuck, I want it to be different, yeah
Waiting on a sign, guess it's time for a different prayer
Lord, please save her for me, do this one favor for me
I had to change my player ways, got way too complicated for me
I hope she's waiting for me
Everywhere she go they playin' my song
That's why I say the things that I say
That way I know you can't ignore me
But so, so

[Hook: Bryson Tiller]
So give me all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
I can't believe I fell in love with you
Got me in my feelings yea
Shit didn't even ready start, nigga going crazy for you
I prolly raise that pistol bout you
Them rumors that you heard are not true
I'm tryna fill that void inside you
I wanna roll up and get fucked up and put licks out on that pussy
I'm so Hood and this dick good, I'll have you all in my bushes
That's promise baby
Lets switch this conversation, with that performance in the bed you need a nomination
Girl you drive me crazy
Others they betrayed me
You might have my baby
I know that's a maybe
Pull off in a MayBee
That's that new Mercedes
I was out of order girl, I needed rearrangin'
You deserve a real one
I'm solid  that's the pavement
Killing niggas, grave shit
Girl let em' hate it
You fuckin' with me
[Pause]
Cause I need you love girl
Like I need that money
How 'bout we fuck on a bed full of hundreds
I mean that
Tell em' lil niggas to that the beast back
Hop upon on that Tiller track
Listen up and play it back
They gon' have a heart attack
Bitches want that chocolate

[Hook: Bryson Tiller]
So give me all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me

[Verse 3: Bryson Tiller]
Yeah, is you at 2 Keys or Tin Roof?
Turn up with young Tiller, we just getting loose
Maybe I'm lowkey feelin' you, don't be cynical
Wonâ€™t fuck you over, wanna fuck you over and again
The truth is I ain't really here to start problems
Girl, I swear to God them hoes can't never say they got him
Know how bad you wanna tell 'em, "don't try him"
I don't wanna tell him, let's surprise him
I don't wanna get into it, why you stressin' him, I've been drivin'
Back and forth, from Louisville to Lexington, mileage
On the whip, got your ass in my grip
College make you wanna strip for them dollars
Nah girl, I got a job for you, swear to God I can do a lot for you
Saw you strollin' through the campus, I had to stop for you
I was scrollin' through the 'gram, girl, I had to follow you
Say what's up with you? You got my soul
