[Ace Hood]
As I walk through the valley of the Shadow of Death
I tell em 'I should fear no man, so where my enemy at?'
I'm movin' that phantom with cannons, see the curtains is black
I murder you niggas for certain I be in and be back
Like an energizing bunny I keep it goin' in fact
Hop on any track and demolish don't you bother with that
Cause that bitch who bothers meet them hollows, drop the towel
We be poppin' like its bottles, chop you up like a cerrado in fact
I get on any shit and rip it, peep my energy pack
Just name any nigga that want it with me riddle me that?
Riddle me this. If I don't rip it you consider me wack
I'm on top of the fucking game, so ya'll do better than that
But I think they cakin', runnin' late, they takin' bricks
Before you think or ever blink
I'll be off up in your place
Put that heater to your face and tell you 'lead me to the safe'
Don't cooperate that caution tape will cover up your place
This is all bets nigga on that muthafuckin' Ace
That is I, greedy guy, run up in and take your pies
If you niggas wonder why, look into my fuckin' eyes
Never wonder whats in mind
Give you just a bit of time
I am starving you fuck niggas outta your mind
Fuck yo problems
Fuck yo momma
Fuck yo baby momma drama
Fuck yo sister
Fuck yo daughter
When you fuckin' with the devils, we are rebels
Hear the tremble when you walk over them pebbles
Wear them guns like they a medal bitch
I heavy medal, handle-grip, word shop like it's a sander
I'm 100 and loaded like a muthafuckin' Rambo
Make you scramble from this ammo
That I put off in this hammer
Bitch it's hammer time
You asinine, no mastermind
And half the time, I'm over-time
And after mine there will be none
And if there's some they runnin' from me half the time
Yes I am a problem
I be wildin', I be smilin'
While I'm asking for your wallet
What you drivin'? Give me diamonds
Ask your lady she desire me cause I'm fly as any pilot
Quitted college just to follow me to sight see on an island
I am G-U-T-T-A, put this base up in your face
Until you feel the b-b-bass, from this k-k-k-kay
I am runnin' in your place
It is I, yes Ace Mr. H double O-D
Mister get you in your sleep
Mister see me in the streets
Bitch I'mma a mutherfuckin' beast
I never sleep, I just go eat
And if I hear of any beef, and then I wanna little piece
Just let me get a little piece
I walk your block and hit your streets like I'm a mutherfuckin' G
A matter fact I am a G
And you a P-U-S-S-Y
All you niggas said I couldn't and I told you to your eyes
Bitch I'm on some murder mind
And bitch I'm on some other grind
You can't compare me to your kind
Just listen up and wonder why
Yes I am blind to you niggas rappin' with no passion
Can't imagine ever yappin'
I be rappin', spittin' magic, let you have it
Now let me breathe and let me free you some satisfaction

Huuuhhh

Like I told you niggas before, see I be in and be back
I'm like an energizing bunny with no energy pack
Fuck lettin' you niggas go breathe you can swallow the track
Or you can swallow all them hallows that inserted the gat
And see I gave you won't fold now I'm back in your chest
It's all bets on the next nigga show me your best
And next time I come around have that cheque and the cash
Just tell them niggas Khaled they should put it all on your man
Yeah, put it all on your man
October 14th, I'm taking all bets in advance
