[Verse 1]
I shouldn't do this shit
I mean who am I fooling

Yeah ima bust me this new weed
I don't need to do it cause that would be [?]
Drinking Remmy with boo and then someone that's stupid be shooting em
I tried to talk to em that doesn't work usually
I'm just like boosie I feel like i'm crazy
Our parties our movies are storming your ladies
I don't throw shade i just shine and you shady
We party the B B bitch yeah that's the 808
Tryna ball nigga fade away
Remember my clothes is on lay-away
Now all these bitches be on me won't stay away
That's how the days go i'm living like day to day

[Hook]
This weed is expensive
These drinks is expensive this flight is expensive
But where am I going (I dunno )
Wake up in the morning and do it all over I prolly shouldn't drink again
Ace Hood
Man fuck it let's drink again
This weed is expensive
These drinks is expensive this flight is expensive
Man fuck it let's drink again

[Verse 2]
Say my weed louder than a ratchet bitch
I done drunk too much and had an accident
I'm in Dubai with a Paris chick who loves Americans but not heritage
She on both her knees but no prayer shit
So allergic to lames i need a claritine
Got ma head spinning like a ferris wheel
I done told myself to never drink again
Who am I tryna kid like a toddler
Still drink champagne with the pastor
I still hang with the killers and the robbers
I love brain but I never went to college
I woke up 2 bitches in ma king-size
I don't remember last night I was too high
And I just hope I put the condom on at flight time
This shit got a nigga thinking bout his life line
Like fuck that she wanted lil ones right
Penthouse 5 Benz for the one night
I might jump on a flight for the first fight
I know it's way too expensive for you guys
I asked the Pilot the code for the WiFi
I'm on the gram no shirt with an 8 pack
So many rocks in the watch no ASAP
It's hood nation cheers with the cognac

[Hook]
This weed is expensive
These drinks is expensive this flight is expensive
But where am I going (I dunno)
Wake up in the morning and do it all over I prolly shouldn't drink again
Ace Hood
Man fuck it let's drink again
This weed is expensive
These drinks is expensive this flight is expensive
But where are we going
Wake up in the morning and do it all over I prolly shouldn't drink again
Man fuck it let's drink again

[Verse 3]

Come meet me i'm home
I'm sorry I know you tried call me several times i'm in the zone
Girl is you ready i'm wilding
Now I got the cannon to give you i'm wilding now
Gone in her mouth give you something to smile about
I get so high give a 5 to a [?]
If I see these bitches i'm diving you get it
I'm trying to pick up the pace i'm getting sluggish
I'm fucking [?] but fuck it it's popping
Tonight in my city you love it we going wherever and never pay [?]
For real tho ironic that i'm in Atlanta
My show set like 20 that's final
I'm hitting the green room to pop me a bottle
Nigga i'm smoking this zip in this [?]
Spending cash money like thugger
My nigga that money truck that's why you shut up
My nigga my life is expensive I love it my nigga

[Hook]
