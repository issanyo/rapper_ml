[Intro: N.O.R.E.]
Stand tall
That mean we bow to no man
We asking nobody for nothing, we gonna stand tall and do it on our own
Like we always did it

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
You see I stand tall, them niggas hunchback
And they talking to the cops, we don't want that
That's our O.G., we blow that
My bullets sticking to your mouth like a thumbtack
Paint the town red, then we paint it blue
'Cause thugged out, crip and blood, man we thought you knew
It's Militainment crew, do this shit usual
And my enemies, dead 'em like your funeral
This shit nothing, my thumb green
Triple beam, infrared blood stream
Your shit is local, my shit is global
Worldwide terrorize through a mobile
I'm out the hospital and back inhaling
Getting money stupid, Sarah Palin
I'm selling white rock, Van Halen
Five-floor yacht, we sailing

[Chorus: N.O.R.E.]
I'm only 5'9" but feel 7 feet
That mean I stand tall, street cred, strong feet
I'm only 5'9" but feel 7 feet
That mean I stand tall, street cred, strong feet
I stand tall, homie I stand tall
I stand tall, homie I stand tall
I stand tall, homie I stand tall
I stand tall, homie I stand tall

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Weed trilogy, burn strategy
Got 'em stuck off that velcro flow, they attach to me
The last of me, top of the list, that green
That bankroll, that stank rolling like a tank
Fuck you think, time keep slipping
Gotta tighten up them lights and your watchband
Just watch me man, catching shadows with my wingspan
Over the land 'fore I land
The candy bars y'all spitting worth a 100 grand
Homeboy, you looking at the million dollar man
With the billion dollar plan
You in the dirt, I'm in the European sand
With a bad bitch, holding hands
We counting up fool

[Chorus: N.O.R.E.]
I'm only 5'9" but feel 7 feet
That mean I stand tall, street cred, strong feet
I'm only 5'9" but feel 7 feet
That mean I stand tall, street cred, strong feet
I stand tall, homie I stand tall
I stand tall, homie I stand tall
I stand tall, homie I stand tall
I stand tall, homie I stand tall

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Homie we stand tall, so do the 7 tre
I'm talking Chris Johnson skating on 28s
You see that candy paint, well that's a river bank
I let them hoes ride, we tryna penetrate
I stack my money tall, I'm talking 7 8s
Roll with the money gang, better check my resume
You niggas lame streeting, must be that Sesame
You just a big bird, you ain't no friend of me
I stay in black just like that nigga Russell Simmons be
I'm talking paper so these [?] I'm in the street
I roll with plenty G's since I was 17
And since we talking G's, spent 30 on a ring
And if we talking guns, I like mine with a beam
It's We The Best the mob, get with the proper team
You niggas been gay, come get some proper cream
Get with the fly niggas, I'm talking angel wings

[Chorus: N.O.R.E.]
I'm only 5'9" but feel 7 feet
That mean I stand tall, street cred, strong feet
I'm only 5'9" but feel 7 feet
That mean I stand tall, street cred, strong feet
I stand tall, homie I stand tall
I stand tall, homie I stand tall
I stand tall, homie I stand tall
I stand tall, homie I stand tall
