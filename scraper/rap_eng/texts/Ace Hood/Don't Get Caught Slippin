[INTRO]
Ace Hood
Street certified
Let me tell you one thing
Don't get caught slipping out here on these streets homeboy
Keep your eyes and ears open, you understand?
Because it might go down

[HOOK]
When the traps side up and the MAC slow down
You better hit the deck because it might go down
Don't get caught slipping, yeah it might go down
Don't get caught slipping, because it might go down
Keep an eye on your nigga, and running around town
Yeah this little boy telling so it might go down
Don't get caught slipping, yeah it might go down
Don't get caught slipping, yeah it might go down

[VERSE 1]
Young nigga seventeen, trying to get money
Niggas laugh about the dough but really ain't shit funny
Just watch who you serve with them birds little buddy
Every fiend ain't a fiend if you see them look funny
You better tell your team, you don't need that money
That shit smell funny, you ain't getting shit from me
I stacked a couple hundred fiends on these something
That white keep coming, tell the boy to keep bumping
Well watch these folks keeping enemies close
And any nigga kin to me they better not fold
He say that he a friend to me but snitching to the po'
He pointing on the court, tell the judge what he know
Price on his head, he be dead by four, so homie don't slip
Or you could be him, no speaking on the phone
Because them FEDS get tips, don't get caught slipping
Because it might be them

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2]
And I won't be slipping, the boy's on a mission
Only vision of winning and my sight is on a million
Serving that white girl to any nigga want to get it
And fresh Louis linen dawg can call that pimping
That thing on my side, homeboy I ain't slipping
Your boy's off snitching, tell them niggas ain't with it
It might go down, so watch you do a round
Niggas creep in the town leave bodies left on the ground
Don't get caught slipping
Because the chopper get down
I stay in all black with a Florida Marlin crown
So keep away the faking ain't a real nigga around
If you ever go down stay loyal to your fam'
And you don't know shit, never snitching on the mound
And homie don't slip, because it might go down
Yeah homie don't slip, it might go down
And homie don't slip, because it might go down

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
And I run my city, I own my town
Can't another man come and disrespect my grounds
You eyeing my nigga, you want something with him?
You want to come get it, you'll be dodging my missiles
Yeah boy it went down, your homie done slipped
And now he in a coffin on a first class trip
Yeah boy it went down, your homie done slipped
And now he in a coffin on a first class trip

[HOOK]
