[Intro]
8:54 am in Los Angeles, nigga
It's on
Undefeated

[Verse 1]
Don't understand, I'm through playin'
Take off that top like you Tarzan
We make it happen, we all win
Raisin' my levels, get tuned in
I'm not the type who will blend in
I'm in this bitch, nigga, wildin'
I see the view through a wide lens
I'm on a...I'm on a high-end
Father forgive me for my sins
I got the heart of a li-on
Cannot forget niggas gave in
I'm at your neck till we paid inâ€¦full

[Chorus]
Nobody panic
We had to struggle and I had my troubles, but everyone managed
Nobody panic, nobody panic
It ain't real, it's just the moment, watch it vanish

[Verse 2]
You need a co-sign
I'm on a mission, it's go-time
You got to feel the emotion
I'm 'bout to get it in no time
I'm 'bout to get it in no time
I'm on some shit that could switch any minute
It started to feel like a Voltron
I treat the flow like a goldmine
Drop a record, make the headline
Fourth quarter it was crunch time
In the field like a landmine
Give me the ball coach!
Kyrie Irving with the handles
Must flex for the cameras
Money dancin' like Hammer
Jesus walking on water
Country boy, I'm so Florida
Thinks it's time to re-order
Glowin' like I'm immortal
Young nigga livin' life, I just be doin' me
I'm on the west-side, turn up the Warren G
Only the family
We on to better things
We on some loyalty
That's over everything (huh)

[Chorus]
Nobody panic
We had to struggle and I had my troubles, but everyone managed
Nobody panic, nobody panic
It ain't real, it's just the moment, watch it vanish

[Verse 3]
They got amnesia
They need a breather
I love dome, I want arena
I want the racks
Venus, Serena
Flooded the watch
I'm on Katrina
Hard times never last
Tough people, they do
Mind-set, we won't lose
Independently moved (uh)
Figure it out
Switch up the game-plan
I don't need a dust pan, I am a made man
Ain't no complaining, just mount it up
I checked the numbers, they adding up
Fly out to Russia for pete's sake
We got a view of the World Cup
We on an ounce of that good stuff
Now we hot-boxing the tour bus
I'm undefeated, we born live
Go at the king, it be your demise
I shoot a shot and immobilize
Pray everyday that he got mine
Hate in the morning [?]
Secretly building my enterprise (argh)

[Chorus]
Nobody panic
We had to struggle and I had my troubles, but everyone managed
Nobody panic, nobody panic
It ain't real, it's just the moment, watch it vanish
Nobody panic, nobody panic
It ain't real, it's just the moment, watch it vanish
