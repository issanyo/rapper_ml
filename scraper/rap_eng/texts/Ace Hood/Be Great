Verse 1: ACE HOOD

Uh guess again they hesitanted
Just to let him in
Walk a mile in my shoes
I swear they never did
Know they never will
Finally Im center fielder
See a mill cry tears , for my old fields
Looking back I promise mama I never will
Gave me chills this humble nigga remaining still
Underrated be the best my ultamatum is in my flow
Cultivate'm, moving like a terminater ugh
So inspired the swag they so admire
Sitting court side with the Boss with empires
Used to be a dream Ima smoking the entire
Moment
R.I.P. My homies
Differnent kind of strokes
The boy Gary Colemen
Meeting different women
And I swear I gottem open
No love for them because the ice box frozen
Been to the bottom now its spring like Poland
Wattup 'tho
Renegades we weriting history
Ima inspired by the beat
Cups for victory

[Hook]
Hey hey hey hey
And I been through that pain
In my life earning my stripes
But still Im going fight this war
Cause they say that I won't
Show them I will
You with me let me hear you say
That we never gone stop aim for the top head to that sky
I just wantto be great
Be great be great be great
I just wanna be great
Be great be great be great
I just wanna be

[Verse 2]

Hella passionate adamant yes accurate
Science to the game I study like that anatomy
Used to can't battle me now I triple your salay
Back full of batteries thats definition of statergy
Day I let them win that'll be death of me
Something you will never see
Dope like amphetamine
Riding in some shit that probably dropping 2017
Martin Luther ain't the only one who had a dream
I just wanna be great MJ style
Doubted by the critics hiphop's stepchild
Little boys and girls way your head down
You can be great you just got to say it proud
On a mission my ambition got me living different
Big crib but a made man living in it
Words to my niggas they the living witness
Believe that Im great glad you living with us

[HOOK]
