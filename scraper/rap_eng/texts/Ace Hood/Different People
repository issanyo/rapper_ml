[Intro: Ace Hood]
We are different people
Born alone, I'mma die alone nigga

[Hook]
We are different people (we are) (x2)
We are different people (church)
Without races (preach)
Different aspirations (preach) (x2)
Different aspirations, without faces

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Mama was a hustler, daddy was a deadbeat
Chances of me out the hood was rarer than some red meat
Pistol on my night stand, now I lay me down to sleep
I believe in god but deep inside resides the beast in me
Nightmares of being broke never seemed to be a joke
Slidin’ with that 44 and my license been revoked
Blondie raised a real G, paid and I'm still me
Real love you real, I don’t respect the niggas in between
I’m like Achilles from the Troy movie
That do some damage like a full Uzi
I am nothing like you other dudes
Same common goals but we got different views
Snitching under pressure, that’s a never do
Click of loyal niggas with me as I’m makin’ moves
Talkin’ tough onto that killer with you in the booth
I’m prepared to die, question is: are you?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Game]
I’m prepared to die, I got the blueprint
To how to tote that 45, survive realized
I can’t be fucked with on no scale
Not the hoes, the money, the swag
Now my G-code, I'mma spray and reload, hit your toe with a tag
Niggas hood with it, yo Ace what's good with it?
He got the ace, I got the spades
Getaway car, we ready for the raid or whatever
I can’t be stopped, no hair
I’m the net son, half a million dollars up will get some
Burner on my waist them hollows yelling "come get some"
I flip you and murder around, yeah red rum
Nigga what the blood clot? Don’t get blood shot
Murder ain’t shit to me, I love taking mug shots
Love taking bitches from Paris down at Jamaica
Love sittin’ on the floor while Rihanna watching the Lakers
I’m a bad boy, ain’t seen Puff in years though
But I keep some B.I.G. off in my ear lobes, hood!

[Hook]

[Outro: Ace Hood]
Mama was a hustler, daddy was a deadbeat (x3)
Chances of me out the hood was rarer than some red meat
Pistol on my night stand, now I lay me down to sleep
Now I lay me down to sleep (x2)
Pistol on my night stand, now I lay me down to sleep
