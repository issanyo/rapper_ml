[Intro]
Everyday, Everyday, Everyday

[Hook]
Every day I gotta hustle, every day I gotta shine
I wake up every morning with money on my mind
I gotta push my verte, I gotta drop my top (Everyday)
I gotta check my trap, I gotta hit my block (Everyday)
Oooh Every-Everyday, oooh Every-Everyday
I gotta push my verte, I gotta drop my top (Everyday)
I gotta check my trap, I gotta hit my block (Everyday)

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Nothin' else matter but the money
Nothin' else matter but the money
Fuck a nigga hatin'
Nigga's used to pull up in the bucket
Now the seven tre cost a hundred
You don't wanna run it
Need a couple mil, I can front it
Everything you do, And I done it, I just keep it one hundred
Every day a nigga gettin' blunted, and I'm with a white snow bunny
Heard you got problems, Glock 40 on me for the dummies
And I got a little for your buddies
Homie don't play that, swear boy thatâ€™s word to my momma
She just told me focus on the comma's, boy that's every day
I just wanna get it ten ways, rollie and a pair of new J's
Every day I wake, I gotta thank the Lord for the day
Then I gotta go and get paid
Oh my goodness
Ain't drived the Porsche in a month, my range rover make a nigga hush
Fuck nigga want
Sorry if I'm being too blunt,I gotta show a hater how to stunt
Boy you a joke, Kevin Hart with it
Deerfield rapper worth about a couple million
Imma go get it nigga, Imma go get it nigga, Imma go get it

[Hook]
Every day I gotta hustle, every day I gotta shine
I wake up every morning with money on my mind
I gotta push my verte, I gotta drop my top (Everyday)
I gotta check my trap, I gotta hit my block (Everyday)
Oooh Every-Everyday, oooh Every-Everyday
I gotta push my verte, I gotta drop my top (Everyday)
I gotta check my trap, I gotta hit my block (Everyday)

[Verse 2]
Boy I'm getting money like a sheikh
Quarter mil, make it in a week
Crib like a mall, young nigga living like meech
A Couple bad bitches in the jeep
20 gold bottles, you don't know nothin' bout this
You don't know nothin' bout a brick, 50K large
Coulda went and bought a new Benz, but instead I just put it on the wrist
And your bitch love it, rich nigga but I'm still thuggin'
Broke nigga's stay mean muggin'
Used to have trouble with the four door Ford, now I'm tryin' make the Forbes
Ya'll ain't seen nothin'
Ain't even trippin', promise Imma die real nigga and free my homeboys in the system
Stay prayed up, every day my mind made up
Every day riding with it tucked, never caught slippin'
Case the wanna push they luck, try me if you thinkin' I'm bluffing
Woo
I love it when the beat go to ride out
I gotta yellow bone stripper at the trap house
I put the Chevy in the shop through summer time
Broward County, Deerfield born, running mine

[Hook]
Every day I gotta hustle, every day I gotta shine
I wake up every morning with money on my mind
I gotta push my verte, I gotta drop my top (Everyday)
I gotta check my trap, I gotta hit my block (Everyday)
Oooh Every-Everyday, oooh Every-Everyday
I gotta push my verte, I gotta drop my top (Everyday)
I gotta check my trap, I gotta hit my block (Everyday)
