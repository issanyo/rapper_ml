This one for the rich niggas
Get high on a bitch nigga
This one for the rich niggas, rich niggas
Get high on a bitch nigga

[Verse 1: $kinny]
Paper cuts countin' money
$kinny pockets gettin' chubby
Why your crew lookin' crumby?
Your whole lifestyle bummy
I make music for the druggies
The potheads and the gully-gullys
I don't break bread with no dummies
If you wasn't with me we ain't buddies, no
100 bands, they upset
All my niggas they in the jet
We pull up in some' foriegn
Why you pull up in some' borin'?
Stars in my roof, two seater coupe
Hit the gas, had your bitch in two
I got cash in the bag and that two-two too
Cali ass in the past with the woop, woop, woop
I get around nigga, holy father, holy ghost
Hold me close, if overdose on holy smoke
These lonely hoes be holy gross
Like moldy clothes they need to go, but I'm aight still
Fuck the cops, drop and hop a pile of steel
Pop some commas, drop some dollars
Pop Nirvana, split the Coupe DeVille, it's suicide for real nigga

[Hook: Sample + Skeme]
Rich nigga
Hear one for the rich niggas
Get high on a bitch nigga
High on a bitch nigga
This one for the rich niggas, rich niggas
Get high on a bitch nigga

[Verse 2: Skeme]
It's clear to see a nigga playin' chess, no checker moves
I hardly listen to these rappers, what they rappin' 'bout ain't never true
They waste 16 bars talking 'bout some shit they never do
Rich nigga introduce these hoes to it like they never knew
Top floor suite in Vegas, man I feel like it's a road night
The bitches runnin' with me lookin' like stars, cue the strobe lights
I'm the type of nigga might just pull up in a Masi
Type of nigga spend 100K and then forget about it
They clapping for a nigga like they really want an encore
I made a million already, what he still making songs for?
I guess I just do it for the love my nigga
Middle fingers up, 12 shots before a judge my nigga
I'm a

Rich nigga
Hear one for the rich niggas
Get high on a bitch nigga
High on a bitch nigga
This one for the rich niggas, rich niggas
Get high on a bitch nigga

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Young rich nigga got his abs on fleek, make the hoes go crazy
Black motherfucker, hundred grand in the duffel in the back of the May-B
All that hating never fazed me
Counted out and being doubted is the type of shit that made me
Money, the power, the respect
Not a stereotypical reject
Youngin as dope as the Pyrex
I got a crib big enough to fit a protest, cold text
Period, why the fuck the competition always curious?
Fuck they gassin' all these rappers, are you serious?
I played your new shit and then I started giggling
Rich nigga, made a whole lot more than six figures
I can never make my mind up at the car dealer
Rocking Saint Laurent jeans with some Margielas
Before 21, dog, I was a rich nigga
I keep the Glock on me only for you fuck niggas
I got my neighbors all thinking I'm a dope dealer
Hood Nation
If you a nigga the realest, [?] go getter
