[Hook:]
Bring the liquor and the drugs nigga
Tell money I'm in love with em
Tryina get it like 12 ways
Gotta get this money everyday
For my mama and my brother then
For my niggas know I got them
We in the building nigga know it's going down
Down, down, down, down

[Verse 1]
Saying God damn homie, I am at it again
Paranoid all this money keep a stick in the bands
Living wrong I just hope the lord washing my sins
From the city where them niggas die in front of they kids
It's cut throat and murda murda all that they know
Got some homies doing time tell em all for the coke
Got no love for the dough, infatuated with dope
That money coming too fast, that's when they hate you the most
The pretty bitches to love, so they fuckin me good
Crib 1.2, I made it out of the hood
I got my wrist on chill, talking [?] to 5
Never one with the snitch, you got correctional tides, it's real

[Hook:]
Bring the liquor and the drugs nigga
Tell money I'm in love with em
Tryina get it like 12 ways
Gotta get this money everyday
For my mama and my brother then
For my niggas know I got them
We in the building nigga know it's going down
Down, down, down, down

[Verse 2]
I say got money and power, got the fields to the cowards
Getting head in the rose, I ain't speaking of flowers
Bitch I stunt for a living, talking travis pastrana
Got a white panamera, I nicknamed her Madonna
Neck covered in gold, check full of them O's
Click full of them zouls, don't want no problem or no
I'm up in nyc, home of big
I sun past through the club, don't need to see id
Hey I'm that boy from the bottom
Got a house from [?] have a taste for the money
I want the whole enchilada
Come and fuck with the real, every bone to peel
Every whip is a foreign, European and schill

[Hook:]
Bring the liquor and the drugs nigga
Tell money I'm in love with em
Tryina get it like 12 ways
Gotta get this money everyday
For my mama and my brother then
For my niggas know I got them
We in the building nigga know it's going down
Down, down, down, down
