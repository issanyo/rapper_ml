[Hook]
My nigga fuck what you say, my niggas out for the cake
Was on the block every night, was on the block everyday
I do this shit for my fam', you do this shit for the fame
I kept it real from the jump, and that's just how I remain
Don't get me started, don't get me started
My nigga, my nigga
Don't get me started, don't get me started
My niggas gorilas, they go so hard, so dumb retarded
Cause a nigga wanna think he's sweet, then try me
Don't get me started, don't get me started

[Verse 1]
OK now, click full of niggas with tempers, click full of niggas and killers
Wanna count me out OK then, look into a niggas eyes, remember
I'm the same little nigga from the block ho, in the drop still rock with the Glock on
I'm about that cream, gwap, l'argent, don't get me started, uh oh
I come through whip in the phantom, y'all niggas really can't stand it
Them hoes really be jocking, diamonds done got you watching
Say Ace ain't getting no money, pussy I beg your pardon
You don't wanna get me started, you don't wanna see me go balling
OK, OK, what it look like
Pull that new thing out then it's good night
With a bad bitch, she's so thick
She's rolling, I know this
And the neck on froze, nigga know that
Act up, I snap like a Kodak
And these niggas, these niggas
These niggas, these niggas
These niggas, these niggas won't hold back

[Hook]
OK, them pussy niggas be hating
Focus on what I'm making
Came through in that phantom
Them pussy niggas can't take it
Spent big bread on my chain
Still long stroking your main
I'm rich nigga, like yeah nigga, they hoping I'd stayed the same
They say I changed when I got fame, bitch niggas they complain
Flat black in that two door, nigga must think he's Bruce Wayne
And they like damn Hood, what it be like
All those diamonds, you don't need lights
New bitch like everyday, swear to god you won't see her twice
That purple done got me leaning, they don't wanna get me started
Come into the hook, no phonics
Hit the dealership and go retarded, huh
Chopper in the trunk in case your mood swing
Extended clips that's standing tall, 2 Chainz

[Hook]
