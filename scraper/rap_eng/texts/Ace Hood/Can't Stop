[Intro: Akon]
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ace Hood, Konvict Music
I know they want us to stop
But we immune to losing
Hey, hey

[Hook: Akon]
Now I can't stop gettin this money now
Cause I'm out here livin this hustlas life
I be workin all day but no 9 to 5
And you know we don't play when it's time to grind
That's how it goes
You wanna get that dough
I'm makin it but I'm still hungry
But whatever it takes I gotta go get this money

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
When I first jumped in the game I was 7 years old
Kept the model, get the money, give a fuck about a ho
Servin' porcelain to people left a brick up in my coat
Always told to eat fast, never snitchin was the code
I would never postpone cause the money get gone
Never waitin by the phone gotta get it on your own
Real niggas get paid every second of the day
Hit the mall blow a quote that I can't fit in this phrase
Just know it's two commas in that Def Jam chain
Lil money wanna scam, bitch I'm outta your range
Make way, feed me, gotta get this money
Smokin nothin' but the best, yeah, the boy so blunted
And I still want money

[Hook: Akon]

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
See niggas show down, my money keeps comin'
You niggas take breaks, my team keeps runnin'
They bring me bagpacks, Louis Vuiton somethin'
Don't really know the price, just know it costs money
And when it comes to money, they know it ain't nothin'
Throw a 100 on jewels, make it back up on a Monday
Why niggas tryna floss, they ballin outta budget
Everyday on the grind, bitch my mind is on my money
Tell 'em roll up the trees and deliver me the scummy
Forget a 9 to 5, Overrated me to quit
Now a day since legit, I get it opposite legit
Me and my nigga 'Kon so addicted to the chips
He gon let you know the script

[Hook: Akon]

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
And whatever it takes, Ace Hood bout money
How much for the chain? I spend bout a 100
See you can dim the lights, but my wrist still sunny
They know I'm on the block, and my fitted in the Glock
Dickies cut with a frame, and a half up in my sock
Gotta get it anyway and keep it level from the cops
Bitch I never play the grind, first rule off top
I been in it for the dough, you niggas need props
I'm just in it for the guap, 100 million in the pot
Only know to go get it, so the printer don't stop
Grab 50 hit a lot, and go and dump it on the drop
I'm starvin like Marvin, it ain't no give and bargin'
Like target

[Hook: Akon]
