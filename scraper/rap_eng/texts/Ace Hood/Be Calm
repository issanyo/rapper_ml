[Chorus]
Spitting nothing but facts, fans screaming I'm back
Legendary I'm that, cooking up a new batch
Guess who got a new glow? Patenting a new flow
Purifying that dough, my dog with me Cujo
These niggas be lying, fairy tales in their rhymes
Something special inside, everything in do time
I just landed Multan, pick me up in that Don
Everybody be calm, everybody be calm

[Verse 1]
Jumped in at 08, destination be great
God got me I'm straight, elevating my faith
Time to set the new pace, must acquire my taste
Ain't nobody here safe, any man em get waste
Crucial point in my life, ain't using no brakes
Everything off the muscle, everyday on the hustle
Feature prices got doubled, start to feel I'm too humble
Told T to get the bag in with this rap 'ish and run circles
Trust The Process, get the concept, god flow in these verses
Fans telling me to keep going gotta stay true to my purpose
Seeing niggas through a real lens they all tough guys on the surface
We ain't buying that hype, we ain't buying our likes
Run around for that check, ain't talking about Nikes
Lately I've been up tight, way to many late nights
Building up a new life, shaking up a new dice

[Chorus]
Spitting nothing but facts, fans screaming I'm back
Legendary I'm that, cooking up a new batch
Guess who got a new glow? Patenting a new flow
Purifying that dough, my dog with me Cujo
These niggas be lying, fairy tales in their rhymes
Something special inside, everything in do time
I just landed Multan, pick me up in that Don
Everybody be calm, everybody be calm

[Verse 2]
Everybody be easy (easy), everybody so needy (needy)
Fat lady at a barbecue, boy I'm 'bout to do a nigga greasy
If we ever get to talking levels boy you working at about a preemie
I can make a nigga disappear, A couple niggas who I know a Genie
Shorty wanna hit the head now she can wrap around like a beanie
Enough with the small talk, you niggas get dog walked
I'm on the side of the outlaw, who want to wrestle a southpaw
I wouldn't of done it without y'all, all of the loving the fans gave
All of them talks in the man cave, all of that money your mans made
Damn
Finally got a hand made, hood nation I claim
Motivating my veins, still spilling my pain
Still drinking champagne, still gym and I train
Hashtag I'm shredded, hashtag more blessings
I was looking in the mirror boy I'm a real nigga with a message (Triple 7's nigga)
3 Bless

[Chorus]
Spitting nothing but facts, fans screaming I'm back
Legendary I'm that, cooking up a new batch
Guess who got a new glow? Patenting a new flow
Purifying that dough, my dog with me Cujo
These niggas be lying, fairy tales in their rhymes
Something special inside, everything in do time
I just landed Multan, pick me up in that Don
Everybody be calm, everybody be calm
