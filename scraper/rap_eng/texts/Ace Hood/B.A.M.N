[Ace Hood & Foreign Teck]
I felt you could push the culture, 'cause you aren't in a rush
You're cool with taking the long way, you're cool with taking the stairs
Cool, cool, cause either way we're gon' get there
And you're cool with the challenge, you're wit' wit' it fighting you back, 'cause everything good is gonna' fight you back. You're not just gonna go get it. So, you're one person that I believe could actually do it
By any means necessary we gon' do that shit, by any means necessary, I'mma keep growing, I'mma keep being great, keep being an amazing father, amazing friend, amazing supporter, you know, amazing musician, amazing person/human-being. And, and, and that's what I have to offer as an artist, as a person, you know what I'm sayin'?
