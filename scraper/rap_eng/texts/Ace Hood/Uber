[Chorus]
Know I had to fuck that bitch
Then I had to put her in a Uber
Call up the shootas runnin' up
Niggas pulled up in a Uber
Way too drunk last night, nigga fell asleep in a Uber
Shawty took a hit of that white, then I got head in a Uber
Uber, Uber, shit goin' down in a Uber
Uber, Uber, shit get wild in a Uber
Might leave the club with a cougar
15 minutes for an Uber
Roll up, smoke another doobie
Nigga hot-box in a Uber

[Verse 1]
??????
Tryna get frank's in the Mueller
Dum-Dum stones in the Cuban
Hatin' ass niggas in the future
Niggas ain't real it's illusion
Y'all niggas round here goonkin'
Fuck my cellphone at?
Nigga must of left it in the Uber
Pretty lil thang I touch it
Say she wanna ??????
She can tell niggas in the Bentley
Nothin' but official niggas wit' me
Came from the dirt but the whip clean
Never lose sight of the big dream
35 G's for the 16
Bless up, millionaire at 18
Boss up, Boss up
We the one's makin' the movies
You the one came wit' the losers
That Benzo Coupe ain't an Uber
Ten bad bitches in an Uber
All black 'Lac full of shoota's [skrrt]
Hope you niggas on go-mode
Your lady beggin' for a photo

[Chorus]
Know I had to fuck that bitch
Then I had to put her in a Uber [I did]
Call up the shootas runnin' up
Niggas pulled up in a Uber [skrrt]
Way too drunk last night, nigga fell asleep in a Uber
Shawty took a hit of that white, then I got head in a Uber
Uber, Uber, shit goin' down in a Uber
Uber, Uber, shit get wild in a Uber [ooh]
Might leave the club with a cougar [ooh]
15 minutes for an Uber [ooh]
Roll up, smoke another doobie [god damn]
Nigga hot-box in a Uber

[Verse 2]
Chillin' in a condo coolin'
Countin' up bandz wit' the toolie
Givin' out Xans to the groupies
Slim-thick bitch wit' a booty
She ain't wit' the shits then remove her
Call another batch in an Uber
Five-Ten minutes see a black truck tinted
Bout eight-nine bitches in an Uber
Young nigga way too saucy
These niggas way too salty
Started from the bottom of the basement [yup]
Wonder why a nigga so flossy [why]
Shawty say I'm way too handsome [yup]
Pretty lil bitch she a dancer [she is]
Tryna be a freak for the Phantom [yuh]
Said she wanna do it on camera [hah!]
Hold up, Hold up [hold up]
Young nigga really got a ??????
Way too high from the moon-rock
Got a nigga mind in the boondocks
5 in the morning, nigga too lit
Parkin' lot head at the ??????
Hold up, hold up, hold up
Man why your friend always actin' so innocent?

[Chorus]
Know I had to fuck that bitch [mhm]
Then I had to put her in a Uber [I did]
Call up the shootas runnin' up
Niggas pulled up in a Uber [skrrt]
Way too drunk last night, nigga fell asleep in a Uber
Shawty took a hit of that white, then I got head in a Uber
Uber, Uber, shit goin' down in a Uber
Uber, Uber, shit get wild in a Uber [ooh]
Might leave the club with a cougar [ooh]
15 minutes for an Uber [ooh]
Roll up, smoke another doobie [god damn]
Nigga hot-box in a Uber
