That's the way

Chorus:
I see the money come, see the money go
It ain't trickin if you got it that's one thing for sure
Stand us high it's the chewy low
One thing for certain you can't lose no offer chasing dough
That's an errythang that's an errythang
See no paper coming go just like the weather change
That's an errythang that's an errythang
Gotta watch these b*tches â€˜cause they argue playin errrythang

Chorus:
I see the money come, see the money go
It ain't trickin if you got it that's one thing for sure
