[Hook]
A dollar and a dream
Get it by any means
Started with a couple niggas loyal to a team
Hard work, it was once a dream
Won it all my nigga, I’m all about the cream
From nothing to something
Nothing to something
Broke as a joke, them niggas would think it was funny
Nothing to something
From nothing to something
How we them niggas on the boulevard who run it

[Verse 1]
From nothing to something
To frequently stuntin’
Used to diss me now them bitches be easily fuckin’
No use for the bucket, I’m whippin’ a Phantom
Still I know who get it cheap out of Little Havana
Keep it kosher niggas, know who be totin bananas
Wet your block up, give a fuck if you holdin’ umbrellas
Watch the niggas you around cuz most of em’ jealous
Pillow talkin’ with them bitches could be repercussions
No pity for weak, we playin’ for keeps
Put feet on the jeep and ride with that piece on the seat
No sleep when it’s beef here, don’t trust the ho from the streets
Niggas set you up and act like they one of your peeps
I got it from nothing, to money in bundles
Don’t give a fuck if niggas owe me a couple of hundred
I need that, I’m talkin’ asap
Got this shit off the muscle, I’m talkin’ way back
Middle finger to you niggas, bitches you hatin’ ass
Only reason I come through stuntin’ with paper tags
Yellow diamonds be shining, know how to pay back
You niggas boring, I whipped the foreign, it’s ace back

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Chasing that money still to church on the Sunday
Hustling foreigns, upgrade you swagger from bummy
Still got that pistol tucked by the waist and the tummy
Fucking these bitches, still they can’t get nothing from me
Rolling on Forgiato's in route to the paper
Let the wrist, ain’t got the window to fuck up a hater
Let’s get ‘em pissed, look at my latest bitch
You would think Beyonce riden with me in the whip
Bitch we the business, couple million
Swimmin’ in fuck what you think or you feelin’
Hustle hard, so potent with bars
Still whippin’ them cars, don’t know what’s in the garage
I’m rich ya, crib got a view and a maid
She cook what I crave, wake up to water and waves
It’s boss livin’, pimpin’, you with it or not
Whole team balling, bitches you fuckin’ or not?
Rollie on me, got more rocks than a crack-head
26’s on the jeep its sitting bow legged
I got what I needed, consistently dreamin’
Lookin’ at a hustler dog if you never seen it

[Hook]
