[Chorus: Slim Diesel]
'Bout to bust out on my watch, it's going greyhound
Lifted on the perkies on the way down
Bitch you wan' be cool you better stay down
You heard me bitch, you better stay down
I've been hot, FWEA, drip
New, watch, FWEA, drip
Bitches like that hit
Gotta, get it, how I, live

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Word around the town I just went independent
Cooking up that work I just been in the kitchen
Travel round the globe, hopping out the 4 doors
4, 5 chains swinging on the polos
They know he a problem
They know what my flow's on
They know I be whipping like I work at Coldstone
Streets done with the talking, I been in a new zone
This that don't nobody, move wrong
Don't pay me attention, they gon' pay me mine in dollars
I'm gon' reposition, take some people out of power
Thought I told you people I'm the king from outta Broward
Let a nigga play and have your family planting flowers
Ain't nobody trippin', cop the new edition
Chillin' with my kids, I got a new addiction
Best rapper alive, I had a premonition
Fuck 'em if they hating, I just do the digits

[Chorus: Slim Diesel]
'Bout to bust out on my watch, it's going greyhound
Lifted on the perkies on the way down
Bitch you wan' be cool you better stay down
You heard me bitch, you better stay down
I've been hot, FWEA, drip
New, watch, FWEA, drip
Bitches like that hit
Gotta, get it, how I, live

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Look into the mirror, ooo, there go a real nigga
Sexy motherfucker, shredded that's a deal sealer
I don't want to meet less we gon' make the deal bigger
They gon' try and put you in a box like Hilfiger
Slim drink like a fish, I swear that boy don't feel liquor
Smoking on some OG, only papers never Swishers
Got my way in this bitch
I'm done with playing this shit
I'm Super Saiyan this shit
I'm fish fileting this shit
Hold up, wait
Ready or not
I got the product to put on the block
Ready or not
I'm in position to triple the pot
FWEA, born in '88
You are not a fraction of what's in my DNA
Chilling in the projects with a shot of E&J
I'm a fly nigga, you just work at TSA
Middle fingers up, I'm sending Trump a PSA
Told her I'm too focused so her company could wait, wait

[Chorus: Slim Diesel]
'Bout to bust out on my watch, it's going greyhound
Lifted on the perkies on the way down
Bitch you wan' be cool you better stay down
You heard me bitch, you better stay down
I've been hot, FWEA, drip
New, watch, FWEA, drip
Bitches like that hit
Gotta, get it, how I, live
