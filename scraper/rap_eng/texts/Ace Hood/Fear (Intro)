[Intro]

Ain't no pity for the weak
S3
Hood Nation!

[Hook]
I'm the one you should fear nigga!
Yeah I'm the one you should fear nigga!
I'm the one you should fear nigga!
Lotta yall don’t like the fact that I'm here nigga!

[Verse 1]
I'm the realest nigga ever
Name another nigga more clever
They ain't flowing how I'm flowing
From the day that I was born
Decided to never let up
Oh
You ain't ever get the letter
Well somebody better tell em
Keep a runnin your mouth
New king of the south
You ain't know no better
Motherfucker guess not
How many wanna come test that
You ain't never been hot
You ain't ever gonna drop
Why you so stressed out huh?
Your little money running low nigga
I'm in the 4-door Ghost with the Zoe niggas
Couple mill & a cd living like I'm big meech
Probably in the streets with a 4 wheeler
5 cars in my drive way
Depends on how I'm feeling
Stash the money in a body bag
Last month I made a killing
You can keep on hating
And its still hood nation
Somebody text Jay Z & tell him rap game mine
He can go on vacation
I mean it
Join if you really can't beat it
I warned yall niggas so be it
Ain't gonna repeat it
Beast from the south
Yeah I said it
All yall niggas is pathetic
Way to petted
Better get your best man ready
I'm feeling real unapologetic oh lord
20 bottles in the VIP boy
I'm just warming up
Hurry dey ran outta 1’s
Ay call up the brinks truck
Cuz I need it
And every nigga hatin gonna see it
I had to put them diamonds in the jesus
Keep away the demons
Broke boy I'm never gonna be it
Realest nigga spitting I meant it
Well dog got jammed
And I'm hoping MJ beat it
Where’s Johnny Cochrane when you need em
O lord!

[Hook]
I'm the one you should fear nigga!
Yeah I'm the one you should fear nigga!
I'm the one you should fear nigga!
Lotta yall don’t like the fact that I'm here nigga!

[Verse 2]
And Everythang 100
Non believers get punished
We the best hood nation
Best believe we run it
And I run my city
And I run my state
I been stunting these rap niggas
Stay in a child’s place
Ain't got no time to waste
Ain't got the time a day
I just pull up to the dealer paid cash on a tag
Why contemplate
Cuz I'm Iller
Young nigga young nigga know you be killin
They all in they feelings
I'm humbled I rock up them numbers
I show you the way to the millions
Starvation 3 ain't no love for you busters
Its fuck yo opionon
Please do not ever get comfortable
Cannot ensure your position
This look in my eyes is struggle & pain bitch I'm on a mission
I do what I want & I say what I please I don’t need no permission
Its fuck em
You ain't with the team or love em
Started from the bottom of the gutter
Watch for the lames
Never know they maybe undercover
Shhh man they maybe undercover
Oh sneaky mother fuckers
Since they wanna watch lets run it
I'm do it bigger next summer
With my dog P to
He gone do the range or the coupe
Crib with a beach side view
And my nigga Jay Ri & K go to
Boy I swear to god I'm the truth
Ima beast in the booth
Lookin at the last of a few
Real niggas get to the lou
Lets get it huh?

[Hook]
I'm the one you should fear nigga!
Yeah I'm the one you should fear nigga!
I'm the one you should fear nigga!
Lotta yall don’t like the fact that I'm here nigga!

(Outro x2)
They ain't had no choice they had to let me in
My foot on all they necks won't them breath again
This greatness in the making I know that within
That hunger nigga this is where it all begin
I'm the one you should fear nigga
