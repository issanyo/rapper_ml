The Renegrades...
Well It's a young nigga, chilling, feeling like a million dollars
Spent a couple house
20 Grand, better follow if you want a holla
Talking Cash and a couple of them rose bottles
Getting money, I'm a mothafucking role model
Wonder How I Do It, Got them niggas mind boggled
8 grand get my new lady a new boob job
Only did it cause she promised me a mouth swab
When she feel this
Hoo Raw
Ahh! You looking at a nigga motivated
Give you bars but I never been Incarcerated
They say I'm higly underrated yet I'm nominated
Every conversation talking how I dominated
Every beat I'm gon guarentee I gon assassinate
Got niggas wide open, pupils dilated
My nigga Khaled...
Wow, I swear I'm swear I'm something like a bad date
We the Best, Khaled tell em what you told me... "U da future"
Now them niggas gon see...

Hook:

2 young niggas with the same dream, both with a common goal just a different time
Ball out, I'm talking major league, turn what was a dream to reality
Ah, I still hustle with my same clique
Alotta niggas dat, but you niggas ain't this...

Meek Mill:

Hustle, I'm gon muscle
I make rain a king, diamonds
Free fall on that paper, it like I'm doing a double
Cause I put in work, ya'll haters get put in dirt
Rollin with the realest niggas you ever seen
Bad bitches on me, Mr. Clean
Word, to that triple beam
In the kitchen
On the counter
Im gon murder any nigga I encounter.......
