[Intro: Plies]
A nigga stressin' badder than a bitch right now, cuz
A nigga almost got married to the liquor, boy
Nigga so fucked up out here, cuz
I'm stressin' badder than a bitch, my nigga

[Hook: Plies]
Done fucked around and got a hoe pregnant
My lawyer hollerin', "Nigga pay me"
Niggas locked up tryna spray me
I got a warrant so I'm shakin'
Seem like I'm all out of blessings
I don't know if God tryin' test me
Tried to help a nigga and he waste me
To tell you the truth, I'm stressin'
Done fucked around and got a hoe pregnant
My lawyer hollerin', "Nigga pay me"
Niggas locked up tryna spray me
I got a warrant so I'm shakin'
Seem like I'm all out of blessings
I don't know if God tryin' test me
Tried to help a nigga and he waste me
To tell you the truth, I'm stressin'

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Chea, my rent due and I'm stressin'
Landlord just called with a message
Say I gotta be out by the 7th
Man I'm sick and tired of this mess
It's like God is takin' my blessings
Bad luck is all in my presents
Fucked 'round and I got a chick pregnant
What the hell I'ma do with that baby?
How the hell I'ma tell my lady?
I'm drunk as hell in my zone
I got a fifth of Henn' and it's gone
I'm fucked up and I'm stressin'
I can't seem to ease that pressure
Fuck niggas can't make it no better
These crackers tryna take my life
Niggas mad and hate what I'm makin'
Heard the Feds is out with my face and
Now I'm scared as hell and I'm shakin
I can't go to jail, I'm on papers
Now them niggas done start with that hatin
I'm tryna help them niggas see paper
But they done fucked around and with the Fed
Now I'm stressed and pullin' my dreads
Them fuck niggas deserve to be dead

[Hook: Plies]

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Chea, I can't win for losin', I'm stressin'
I dropped a quarch of my flesh
Man I'm tired as God as my witness
Tryna smile but pain is my vision
Man I'm tired of lyin' to my folk
Fucked 'round and I'm servin' that coke
Baby mama tryna take me to court
Tryna holla 'bout child support
Fucked 'round and I got me on papers
Now I'm mad as hell, I can't take it
I drop and pray to my maker
Dear Lord, if you hear my prayer
I'm stressed and I can't go on
It's like I'm all out of blessings, Lord
I'm alone, ain't nobody to call
I got bills but the money can't solve
Mama cryin' but her tears just fall
(Nigga stressin')
Ay Big Tats, what I'm gon' do now?
These crackers wanna take my ride
They wanna take me away for life
See my body can't take no more
It's like a young nigga life so wrong
No pain, my feelings gone

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Chea, and I do it for my niggas in jail
Doin' time and they tryna make bail
I hold it down for them niggas, don't tell
Let 'em know they gon' see that appeal
Let 'em know it's the real nigga watchin'
And never mind, I grind, they stoppin'
So middle finger to them fuckin' Feds
They gave my dawg 25 in the pen
All my snitch niggas say he did it
With no lawyer, the judge don't bend
K'Supa Jock, I love ya homie
So I put that shit on my kid
And up on my unborn kids
So once you know you a nigga that's gone
Is locked up with a struggle at home
Put'cha hands up in the sky
Let 'em know that he ain't alone
The real niggas hold it down at home
And real niggas gon' hold they own
Yup yup, hold they own
