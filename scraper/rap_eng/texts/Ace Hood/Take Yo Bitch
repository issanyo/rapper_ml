(Hook)
A true playa for real
Know you heard about me
I done pop 2 mollys
And I’m going on 3
How I’m out my mind
And this bitch so geekin
Tryina tell yall niggas
Don’t let yo girl round me
I’mma take yo girl
I’mma fuck yo bitch
I’mma take yo girl
I wanna fuck that bitch
I’mma take yo girl
I’mma fuck yo bitch
I’mma beat that up
Give her all this big

(Verse)
Okay now bad lil bitch from the ATL
And she got an ass like Kay Michelle
Rule number one, no kiss n tell
Her head no joke like Dave Chapelle
I see I beat that pussy like a murder case
She gon catch this white like Colgate
Keep my hoes in line like Soul Train
Every day a nigga ball, no rogaine
I say 20 bottles I’m flexin
Diamonds and my Rolex’s
Where the bad bitches? Where the bad bitches?
I’m just checkin
Man I pop the molly, I’m sweatin
Bag the bitch now we textin
Plenty more in my section
I’m a young version Hugh Hefner
I can’t even feel my face
I don’t really need no more drink
All these hoes, they comin with me
All them niggas they can’t believe
I say I’m rollin, I’m rollin
And this dope, I’m smoking potent
I need you, you, you and her right there
Back to the crib so we all can share

(Hook)
A true playa for real
Man you heard about me
I done pop 2 mollys
And I’m going on 3
How I’m out my mind
And this bitch so geekin
Tryina tell yall niggas
Don’t let yo girl round me
I’mma take yo girl
I’mma fuck yo bitch
I’mma take yo girl
I wanna fuck that bitch
I’mma take yo girl
I’mma fuck yo bitch
I’mma beat that up
Give her all this big

(Verse)
Okay I’m killin these hoes like Ted Bundy
Love a bad bitch, I’m a head junkie
White tank top and some polo undees
Tryina serve a freak with this chocolate Sundae
Snatch your chick like a ally oop
Shots that ciroc, I don’t do the goose
Put her in the coupe, I remove the roof
Then slam-dunk that pussy like Bron do
I say hold up doc I ain’t feelin well
My Rolex sick and my pockets earl’d
Throwin' up money, I’m sick as hell
Bout 25k, that’s life in jail
Now where them bad hoes at with them ass shots
Rep for a nigga, be the mascot
KOD, I brung major cash
And they waving at me like a cab guy
Say turned up nigga don’t turn down
Please don’t bring your ho round, nah
I don’t wanna know her name
Next thing you know we went 4 rounds
I’m a wild young nigga, I admit that
Who? That bitch? I’mma get that
She’s in love with my 6 pack
And I ain’t talkin no beer pack nigga

(Hook)
A true playa for real
Man you heard about me
I done pop 2 mollys
And I’m going on 3
How I’m out my mind
And this bitch so geekin
Tryina tell yall niggas
Don’t let yo girl round me
I’mma take yo girl
I’mma fuck yo bitch
I’mma take yo girl
I wanna fuck that bitch
I’mma take yo girl
I’mma fuck yo bitch
I’mma beat that up
Give her all this big
