[Intro]
(Everything Foreign Nigga)
I don't play to lose
No I don't play to lose
No I don't play to lose

[Hook]
No I don't play to lose
No I don't pick and choose
Sometimes you win some
Sometimes you lose (sometimes you lose)
Sometimes I can't get right
Most times I do (sometimes I do)
'Cause sometimes you win some
Sometimes you lose
We just gon' get right back up (eh)
That's not quite like us (eh)
Y'all ain't built like us (eh)
Know in God I trust
The Nation

[Verse 1]
Got it I'm bout it whatever
Finally got it together
Taking some time out the schedule
Run up a check in my level
Won't let my foot off the pedal
Staying away from the devil
Stay prayed up forever
Fuck with me, never
Boy you're way to clever
Hot like sun on leather
Dropped the top nice weather
I let her smile these days
Look how far we came
I'm on my gang gang shit
Me and the gang gang lit
Pulled up the new thing with a new thing
Let the Liu-Kang kick
I got my own lane, do my own things, and I'm fresher than a bitch

[Hook]
No I don't play to lose
No I don't pick and choose
Sometimes you win some
Sometimes you lose (sometimes you lose)
Sometimes I can't get right
Most times I do (sometimes I do)
'Cause sometimes you win some
Sometimes you lose
But we just gon' get right back up (eh)
That's not quite like us (eh)
Y'all ain't built like us (eh)
Know in God I trust
The Nation

[Verse 2:]
Get it i got it i'm on it
Pray I wake in the morning
Gotta say one for the homies
Some of them still on the corner
Some are without a diploma
Hoping that money get longer
I got the world on my  shoulders
You are not build ford tough
I'm in a drop going nuts
I got the blessings going up
It's never them always us
I let her smile these days
Look at how far we've came
I do not ever know what's on the other side but I 'gotta be brave
I don't want never be a slave, I put them boogers in a chain, I 'gotta go against the grain, I 'gotta put it on my name

[Hook]
No I don't play to lose
No I don't pick and choose
Sometimes you win some
Sometimes you lose (sometimes you lose)
Sometimes I can't get right
Most times I do (sometimes I do)
'Cuz sometimes you win some
Sometimes you lose
But we just gon' get right back up (eh)
That's not quite like us, (eh)
Y'all ain't built like us, (eh)
Know in God I trust
The Nation (eh)
