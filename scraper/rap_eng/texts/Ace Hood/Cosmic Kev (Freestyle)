('Grove Street Party' beat)

Ok, now pocket full of money
Bitches think I'm bowlegged
Jumping outta that Phantom
Strapped up like a tool-shed
Play me like a sucka', leave you in a blood-bed
Big fire in my waistline, and I'll bust mine into yo' head

SK's, M16's, and AK's I'm totin'
Ridin' round with my dreads down and my young niggas ferocious
See they be on some other, sister mother brother
All my people strapped up, and they keep their's in their cupboard

Homie, I'm just tryna' party, Rosay don't do Bacardi
My bitches like it thick, that pussy wet as a tsunami
I jump into her waters and explore her like safari
I swear my money old, smellin' louder than a Sharpie

I'm a wild ass nigga, show me where that paper at
All about my dolla' signs, that should be my zodiac
Man, you niggas super wack, hit me with the track, and I murder that

Man you niggas too coffee, hate yo' raps
I be statin' hip-hop facts
Young nigga, come see hip-hop back
A-C-E, the best un-wack
And you just here to clean the mats

('We be Steady Mobbin' beat)
OK, now welcome to my drumline
Pistol by my waistline
Homie run up on me, give him 30 like it's breaktime

Tell him 'have a nice day'
I do shit the right way
If you hata's hatin', y'all are sweeter than a rice-cake

Used to ride a Hyundai
Now I'm in some new shit
I can blow a 100, check the bank like "that a'int do shit"
I be on that cool shit
Dining in that Ruth Chris
Ask me what I'm doin', still hustlin' tryna' get rich

I be goin' beast mode
Fly-fitted T on
Guess what's by the belt tho'
Call that bitch 'Just me Alone'
All black, no chrome
Chevy painted two-tone
Neck full of ice like somebody turned the lights on

Swaggin' with a redbone
I just call her 'headphones'
Love it when she sing the music right into my mic'phone

Ha, and nigga you don't want no problem
That AK-40, you can solve 'em

(unknown beat, please tell me in comments)

My nigga Kid-Go, he just bought a trey-pound
And he'll bust a nigga, I just call him greyhound
My top got an attitude, so it stay down
I hate talkin' so I gotta keep a gun 'round
Plus an extra clip, another 20 rounds
See me chisel up, you betta' know it's going down

See, I'm a problem, yeah on the beats boy
Hear you other guys like 'mmm chew toy'

Uh, well I'm a beast and on some other shh
See, y'all ain't ever seen this, it's like a mother-ship
Yeah, and everyday I'm gettin' scholarships
Best Brain, I should nickname it 'collarship'
Get it? Haha, 'collarship'

My mindframe so frickin' outta here
'Blood, Sweat, and Tears' album of the damn year
Better ask Cosmic Kev, I'm the real deal
Ha, yeah, see I'm the real deal
Better pass on this Ace at a new deal
Chea!
Uh!

(unknown beat, please tell me in comments)

Well I'm a We The best gangsta'
Knife by my ankle
Hold my label down like a mufreakin' anchor
All about the paper like a mufreakin' staple
Rocks in the watch, ain't talkin' bout cradle
Real nigga hear, while you otha' boys fable
Ride with a snitch, that can end up bein' fatal
Shoot you in ya' spine, now ya' body disabled
Gotta pay feva, disconnected like cable
Ridin' in that 7, got it painted all maple

Yeah, I'm talkin' syrup, leather outta Europe
Call my nigga Kev, tell him "Hood finna' burn 'em"
Load another beat, come and listen to the sermon
Pockets on Sherman, club with the dumb flow
I be with a bad 'ho, moving in that new ghost
And I'm ridin' two 4's, top where? Who knows
Tank top camos, Strapped like Rambo
Paint's on slime, I should name the bitch Vado

I don't, see a nigga out 'chere, cause they know I'm out 'chere. Yeah, a nigga out chere
Wanna' make a hit, well homie I can be yo' counselor
Shouts to my nigga Meek Mill, that's for real though
Came out to Philly, ate a steak before my night show, Uh!

Ha, I'm a beast on the instrumentals
Kev, sorry for my incidentals
