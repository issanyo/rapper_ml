Hey you heard about home boy
Yea, God damn
Left him with a house on why
Yea, God damn
I bet he know how we play now
Yea, God damn
Better lay down and stay down
Yea, God damn
God damn [6x]
Why they did that boy like that
God damn
Why they did that boy like that
God damn

[Verse 1 - Gunplay]
Umpire show catcher, O miss
Dirty long ratchet, on lap
Hundred fifteen in the can
Dusty, still but it bam
But it bam
You short by the gram
You can die about that
Ain't no lyin' about that
My dog, so we go bang Buku
Hello, 88 apes, ZOO CREW
Handcuffs like a noose too
Bitch I'm black ops, noob tube
Now who wanna run one in
Won one done in
Left with ten one ten
Fuck you want me to do
Feelin' unbeatable
My wolf pack snappin', lookin' unfeedable
Get buddy, but he gon' get bruised, untreatable
I'm on that shit Steven Seagal do
You know what
I'm trialed all the way
The junkie tried it, man he died on the way
All that damn meat and mine on the way
You trap but you won't trap down all the way

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Ace Hood]
Blood, sweat and tears
Mind over matter
Shittin on you niggas, got a bad bladder
Brand new panorama (zoom), my bitch from Atlanta
Sit on daddy lap, yeah she call me Santa
Dancin' in that pussy bitch I think I'm MC Hammer
Touch my paper bitch, I'm buckin' like I'm out of Tampa
Steel ladder, they say my flow tragic
But them niggas criticing like it was pro rappin'
Real nigga
Deal with him
Leave a nigga in a box like Tommy Hilfiger
Put up K (put up K)
Give me some of them bad bitches
The ones who like 'it rough and hard like them college quizzes
You feel me (You feel me)
You feel me (You feel me)
Bad old bitches throw me back just like a Frisbee
Word up (word up)
Straight stuntin'
Bitch I hit the biller take the five hundred

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Torch]
AK, AR, hollow tip accessory
Run up in your vestibule, dodge you like a decibel
Leave your ass a vegetable
Beefin', now you a side dish
I ain't a chef but I mastered how to fry fish
When digits stackin, Kiddin' turned to kidnappin'
I know the pigs tap us so we convo pig latin
Feds following me like I'm playing Simon Says
Bishop then ride a maze, nigga till the trauma dead
I'm with the drama kit
You know I drama do it right
Sheets on the spot, next stop trauma unit
Head bussa, meet her at a military
Brand like bills but he never ain't a bitch scared
Street sweepers, three divas, straight stuntin'
When money ain't lackin', of course they fuckin'
No strings, I control her, puppet master
Molar, stolen plaster, go get my money faster
