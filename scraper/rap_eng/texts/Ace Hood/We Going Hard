[Intro]
Ace Hood!
What’s crackin’ nigga?

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
Getting it in, you niggas losing
We pop bottles, we really do this
Rims on the ride, them hoes shining
It’s YMCMB, go 'head join the alliance
Niggas looking tough, but they ain't 'bout that action
And if she coming back, you know I'm smashing
I-I-I put in work, watch me hustle
You niggas is nerds I'm talking Steve Urkel
Yeah my soldiers with me, like the Navy nigga
It's mashed potatoes over here it’s all gravy nigga
Yeah a white tee, and some Nikes
It's a hundred thousand resting on my white tee!

[Hook] (2x)
Me and my niggas (Yeah!)
We going hard (Yeah!)
My money stacking, we living large (Tchea!)
Count it up (Count it up!)
How much is that? (How much is that?)
If there's a problem, we'll handle that!

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
If you niggas looking for me I'm cool in the Phantom
White on white I named that bitch Hannah Montana
Strapped with that hammer, got bars like a slammer
You sleeping on me homie you'll die in pajamas
Dope as it gets, no coke in my veins
I'm way too fly; it's a bird it's a plane!
Anybody wanna know my name, H double-O D with flames
Ain't playing around with them lames
Quarter mil' I spunt on my chain
You rappers y'all are actors, fuck once don't call her after
I'm back like chiropractors, book me twenty a chapter
Flow go so damn retarded; lower learning level
Underrated homie still I made two mil' or better...

[Hook] (2x)

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
They said you the man, but I got all the power
You got in a lot? Homie I highly doubt it
Talking too much, that's how you get in trouble
Pillow talking to these hoes, thinking that they love you
Stick to yo lines, you niggas is actors
How you broke in traffic? Must be hustling backwards
Money don't buy respect, it's rules to the game
And if you don't know, then you shouldn't be playing...

[Hook] (2x)
