Now I dun been so talked about and laughed at
Doubted by my family
Reachin for them favors but nobody giving hand backs
Came back, anthrax, spitting like a automac’
This is where it started at, way before that We The Best
I was back in Deerfield, giving momma heart attacks
Calling but no answer she jus wonder where her son was at
I was in the studio, you was moving work and blow
I was thinkin’ bigger shit, they just want some 24′s
Me I’m dreaming millionaire, I dont think they hear me though
Slidin’ with my brother them, what you think that rental fo’
Livin at my momma house, tellin me to watch my mouth
Workin with that 9 to 5, hated it without a doubt
F–k that job and left it there, met with DJ Khaled them
Couple months I’m outta here broward county pioneer
Walking with no kinda feel, passed up on them scholarships
Mr. Broward county in the flesh remember I am him
And I play the game how I’m ‘posed to got my name all on Them posters I ain't boastin I’m jus’ stating facts
And I’m taking over fuck you loners
Tell yo owner I pulled over like my Rover may have caught a flat
I am fucking back, like yo spinal cord
All you lames extinct, to many dinosaurs
Flow is super sick, I’m talkin herpey sores
Biggest shit in years, I’m talkin jersey shores
Ya, and like a cheeto I remain the same
Gotta let the world know wat my f-ckin name
Thats why I hustle like I’m ten of yall
And they dont believe me check my protocal
I’m mista, keep a bad bitch, Louis V frames
I jus’ hope you get the picture
Man a nigga starvin marvin and no time to bargain
None you niggas pose a threat, y’all ain't in my target
Swingin to the top spot you can call me Tarzan
Walking over lames, they can clearly play the carpet
Hot shit, arson, murder scene caution
They dont want it with the kid, gladly get abortion
See you niggas pocket watching, you won't get a portion
Think im really slippin tho, bullets to yo organ
Yea you niggas supa ducks yea I’m talkin oregon
Ride the beat no choruses, like I’m in some foreign shit
Kayko told me murder dat, so I went and bodied this
Ballin like I’m by the rim, I deserve a scholarship
This is where im at today, you should come and follow him
I be on my planet tho, come and see my mother ship
Fuck the game and let it go, there is no more sportsmanship
3 years with that We The Best, sorry I dont see the rest
I dont care who comin next, you won't see me break a sweat
Better than yo next effects, greater than yo thoughts can get
Its me I am in the flesh, and this as good as it can get
Man you niggas never pose a threat
