[Verse 1]
Ok now first things first, Cali my mother fucking dog
Polo briefs, I keep that pistol in my draws
Hop out that Chevy, I'm sitting Yao Ming tall
Nigga jump in my water I'll play the mother fucking Jaws
Young nigga stunting, I keep them haters so appalled
Don't mention my name if 20 grand ain't the cost
Nigga fuck it I got it, blew 50 bands just to floss
I honor thy father, spit 25 on the cross
And big ups to Weezy, and plus my nigga Ricky Ross
Imma hop on this beat and lose my mind, what you thought
You bout it, I'm wit it, gave the Chevy some switches
Dick her down and I'm missing, Don't be loving these bitches
That's a no-no like sipping on the four loco with some broke joes
Chick with me deep throat, Ace Hood, beast mode
My shot, free throw, pussy nigga, He ain't know
Leave who? she ain't slow, That nigga, bingo

[Hook]
I'm not a star
Somebody lied I leave these bitches in the all
I leave these bitches in the all
I leave these bitches in the all

[Verse 2]
Ok I hop out my ride and 4 giatos on the car
It's me and my nigga, we stunting on em by far
I pull up the club, I got a hundred in my jeans
You know I'm signed clean nigga, I'm all about the seed

[Hook]
