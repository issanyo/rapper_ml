[Intro]
You hear me now?
I hear you
Nation

[Verse 1]
Don't give a fuck 'cause in this moment I got shit on my mind
Just to test a nigga heart I put that bait on the line
Tryna level, balance out, I meditate all the time
Learned my lesson, turned my blessings into one of a kind
I'm gon' stand up face to face to anything in my way
Mama told me never let my fearless get in the way
I'm waking up like how the hell can I get better today?
I gave myself that confirmation 'boy, you already great'
I'm undefeated, I feel the genius inside me alive
Took a minute, rewired vision, I finally arrived
You can feel it in every lyric I speak in my rhymes
No competition, I'm totally different, you fully advised, I
Heavy on the grind
Working my relationships to even out the odds
Stacking up the money, put some people on the job
Heard some people sleeping so I'm turning up the nob
I am just another living version of a God
Taking care my body so it fully get to thrive
I've been traumatised, (ay)
I've been ill advised, (ay)
I can't sympathise, (ay)
Once I emphasise
I'm undefeated

[Chorus]
This shit is deeper than a rap, in fact you gotta know the meaning
Misunderstood, hope you ready when I come undefeated
I took some blows
Got back up and told them demons 'undefeated'
Every time they count me out I come back harder undefeated

[Verse 2]
I feel that holy ghost inside me, they admire my glow
I told myself to get back up when I got down on my low
I told myself that I won't let these people snatch at my soul
I told my dawg, ain't tell him shit because he already know
And I'm on my savage trip to Paris, my arrogant flow
And I got that Frankie Lucas Montana, that heroin dope
Never want you to confuse it, my music just therapeuto
Oh, I meant therapeutic
I'm in that coupe, the new 6
I'm with my queen and my kids
I need them much as my ribs
I must invest in my shield
I'm like the best in my field
They lack the patience be still
I'm activated, I am
I'm going ape in that gym
You looking sad as that jim
Don't be afraid of that shit
Let no one tamper with it
I got control of all my demons, I been king every since
I'm on a totally different frequency, it's too evident
I'm in a new element
I'm on some you ain't legit
On another level
Hungrier than ever like I'm locked into the cellar
Never question God, I know he working for the better
Got him where I want him, ain't no letting off the pedal Undefeated

[Chorus]
This shit is deeper than a rap, in fact you gotta know the meaning, yeah
Misunderstood, hope you ready when I come undefeated
I took some blows, got back up and told them demons 'undefeated'
Every time they count me out I come back harder, undefeated
