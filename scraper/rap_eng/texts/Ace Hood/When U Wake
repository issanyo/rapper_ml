[Intro]
When you wake

[Chorus]
When you wake up in the morning, get the bag
Get the bag, that gon make them mad
And when you wake up in the morning, get the bag
Get the bag, that gon make them mad
I put the jewelry out the safe, who just got the tay
Disrespectful swag, Greechie on they ass
I be countin' all my blessings, count 'em up
Countin' all my blessings, count 'em up

[Verse]
Niggas mad, heard these niggas mad (boy)
Doin' what I'm 'posed to do, not dwellin' on the past (ain't trippin')
Switchin' up my focus, I'm too focused on the bag (the money)
Father please protect me, throw them crosses on the dash (yee)
Walkin' over Neimans, tell 'em add that to the tab (they hatin')
When I heard they hatin', I just go 'head and I laugh (ha-ha)
Make a new deposit then I just go 'head and I dab (dab)
Starin' in the bucket, there's just way too many crabs
Barely takin' naps, backwood on them raps (uh)
Bluntin' and I'm plenty, takin' over rap (yee-yee)
Everything blessin', blood became flesh (I did)
I can't feel no bullshit that's throwin' my direction (hm)

[Interlude]
And that's what I'm saying
Like I ain't finna to apologizing for being great as shit like that
Nigga be worried about another nigga life and shit like that
Like what he doing in his life
A nigga need to get focused man
Want a piece of advice?

[Chorus]
When you wake up in the morning, get the bag
Get the bag, that gon make them mad
And when you wake up in the morning, get the bag
Get the bag, that gon make them mad
I put the jewelry out the safe, who just got the tay
Disrespectful swag, Greechie on they ass
I be countin' all my blessings, count 'em up
Countin' all my blessings, count 'em up

[Outro]
Oh I'm rich, what the fuck
It was God, it was luck
It was Him, it was us
I'm the shit, don't you flush
Girl you fine, don't you blush
I'm so blessed, count it up
Count me in, overcome
Every time, I'm too tough
Oh
