[Intro]
Let 'em haters keep talking

[Chorus]
Anybody seen a waitress?
Tell her bring more liquor
All my dawgs in the building, and we smokin’ on that killer
Anybody know a hater? Middle finger to the ceiling
Feelin’ like John Gotti – can’t nobody fuck with us
(turn up, turn up)
UH, We them niggas (we them niggas)
We them niggas, we them niggas
(we them niggas, we them niggas)
All the bad bitches know it (all the bad bitches know it)
We them niggas, we them niggas
(we them niggas, we them niggas)
Middle finger to the ceiling (middle finger to the ceiling)
We them niggas, we them niggas
(we them niggas, we them niggas)
We don’t really give a fuck (we don't really give a fuck)
‘Cause we them niggas, we them niggas (hannn, hann)

[Verse 1]
I’m screamin’, “Fuck them other niggas ’cause I’m down for my niggas,”
Middle finger to the ceiling, everybody keep calm
‘Cause you’ve got some real niggas in the building
And you don’t really look familiar, that’s your girl?
My bad, in my ear she’s been begging me to hit her
Oh lord! Oh lord!
Have her really catching feelings all night from the club to the villa
Know you’re chilling with the realest, I ain’t even gotta say it
Blowin’ money, I don’t really mean to litter
We them niggas, we them niggas from the bottom to the top
Y’all mad? LOL, go figure
Balmain on the feet, twenty bottles of the peach
On the way, light ‘em up, light ‘em up (light 'em up)
I don’t really give a what, I don’t really give a what
Mess around, I’mma buy the whole club (that's rich)
I’m just really showin’ love
That gon’ probably get ‘em mad, so sad
All haters need a hug (haha)
Take a hit of these drugs, gettin’ high with my dawgs
‘Til the ma’fuckin’ sun come up
Let it pass, puff puff

[Chorus]
Anybody seen a waitress?
Tell her bring more liquor
All my dawgs in the building, and we smokin’ on that killer
Anybody know a hater? Middle finger to the ceiling
Feelin’ like John Gotti – can’t nobody fuck with us
(turn up, turn up)
UH, We them niggas (we them niggas)
We them niggas, we them niggas
(we them niggas, we them niggas)
All the bad bitches know it (all the bad bitches know it)
We them niggas, we them niggas
(we them niggas, we them niggas)
Middle finger to the ceiling (middle finger to the ceiling)
We them niggas, we them niggas
(we them niggas, we them niggas)
We don’t really give a fuck (we don't really give a fuck)
‘Cause we them niggas, we them niggas (hannn, hann)

[Verse 2]
I let them haters keep talkin’ while the money pile up
I pull up in a two-seater, you see him with a badass bitch
Lil’ nigga, that’s a must
Good Lord! Good Lord!
Man, her ass so retarded it belong on a short yellow bus
And she rollin’ with them niggas, but she knew that already
Yeah, we heavy in this bitch like “what?” (like what)
Now where you from, where you from?
Don’t nobody else matter but your day one niggas from the jump (day one)
Yeah we started from the bottom with a dream and a dollar
Keep it real, shorty, I know you wanna fuck (yeah you know you wanna)
Amen! Amen!
Swear this watch that I’m wearin’ on my wrist
Man, this shit is pretty rare
Everything I do big, all I do is set trends
You can try it, don’t nobody really care
Don’t nobody really care
I could show you my committee, in my city
Boy, I’m treated like the mayor
Way the bezel gold is shining on a 100 grand Rollie
Boy, it really ain’t a choice but to stare (bling, bling)
I’m just keepin’ shit player

[Chorus]
Anybody seen a waitress?
Tell her bring more liquor
All my dawgs in the building, and we smokin’ on that killer
Anybody know a hater? Middle finger to the ceiling
Feelin’ like John Gotti – can’t nobody fuck with us
(turn up, turn up)
UH, We them niggas (we them niggas)
We them niggas, we them niggas
(we them niggas, we them niggas)
All the bad bitches know it (all the bad bitches know it)
We them niggas, we them niggas
(we them niggas, we them niggas)
Middle finger to the ceiling (middle finger to the ceiling)
We them niggas, we them niggas
(we them niggas, we them niggas)
We don’t really give a fuck (we don't really give a fuck)
‘Cause we them niggas, we them niggas (hannn, hann)

[Outro]
Let me hear you say “fuck 'em niggas” (fuck 'em niggas)
‘Cause we them niggas, we them niggas
Let me hear you say “fuck 'em niggas” (fuck 'em niggas)
‘Cause we them niggas, we them niggas
Let me hear you say “fuck 'em niggas” (fuck 'em niggas)
‘Cause we them niggas, we them niggas
Everybody know they can’t fuck with us (fuck with us)
‘Cause we them niggas, we them niggas, what?
(we them niggas what)
‘Cause we them niggas, we them niggas, what?
(we them niggas what)
‘Cause we them niggas, we them niggas, what?
(we them niggas what)
We them niggas, we them niggas
(we them niggas, we them niggas)
We don't fuck with y'all niggas
