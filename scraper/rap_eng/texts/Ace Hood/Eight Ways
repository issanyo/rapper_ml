[Skit]
See you are what you are in this world
It's either one of two things
Either you're somebody, or you're nobody

[Pre - Hook]
Politics as usual, in my new juelz
Tailor made Armani suits, yeah thats gon' fit me well
Givenchy be my cologne, them hoes will go and smell
Mr. Hood gonna give you game, on just not how to fail

[Hook]
One : Never lay your head the same place you intend to sell
Two : God forbid you go to jail you just don't ever tell
Three : Gotta watch them niggas round you cause of jealousy
Four : Friends close, but be closer with your enemies
Five : Business and pleasure never really go together
Six : Never, ever let nobody see your stash of cheddar
Seven : Loyalty over royalty, I put God first
Eight : Most important your at the table, now whats your worth ?

[Verse 1]
You not dining at my table bringing nothing to it
I done hustle for my youngings that's who I influence
Cracking lobsters, and rocking fur like a fucking mobster
Versace mansions with companions, discussing commas
You may see the foreign, never will you see me sweat
Promoters sending me deposits while they sending threats
Abu-Dhabi in Maseratti, I'm kamikaze
My spanish mami gon' bless her papi with sloppy toppy
Never love 'em, never trust 'em, Jesus made that mistake
Stack your money, feed your family go buy some real estate
Servin' junkies wasn't for me, I'm trynna educate
Bossin' up a hundred milion welcome to heavyweight

[Verse 2]
Money come and then it goes, how much for your soul
Fancy whips, designer clothes, turn your friends to foes
Know that everything that glitters, isn't solid gold
You never know the hand you dealt, but just don't ever fold
Stacking figures, so essential, younging I'm thinking bigger
Not a victim, beat the system, not just another nigga
Hating on you, preying on it, they wanna see you fail
Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, welcome to fucking hell
Play it clever, watch the devil's, pray the Lord is my Shepherd
Do your thing, and keep it sided, business don't mix with pleasure
Know some people, know some secrets, swear I will never tell 'em
Wake up grinding like you're broke, and know you'll be good forever
