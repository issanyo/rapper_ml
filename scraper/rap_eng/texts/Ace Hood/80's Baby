[Hook]
Ever since I came into the game
I been goin harder in the paint
Ever since they heard about the name
They know who gon put out with the flame
Ever since I'm in my own lane
All you niggas start to sound the same
Ever since I started with the reaI
I can never understand a lame
What is real? what is fake?
You be wise, nigga snakes
Born in May, 80 baby
On a level eighty eight

[Verse 1]
Legendary, very scary
I don't think that goofy shit is necessary
I do not want to be a part of ordinary
Blood of Jesus, saw me born, son of Mary
In here whippin' like I'm gold with culinary
And he's in it kickin' shit like Vinatieri
Oh my goodness
I get that feelin' sometimes
I don't wanna fuck with people, just this business of mine
You can't come into my space with all them negative vibes
Ain't no intoxicating my circle, we gon sever them ties
Just my policy, no apologies
All one hundred that's why real niggas follow me
Ever since I stepped into the light
I don't ever buy into the hype
Never get too low or get too high
Never let them cover up your size

[Hook]
Ever since I came into the game

Ever since I'm in my own lane
All you niggas start to sound the same
Ever since I started with the real
I can never understand a lame
What is real? what is fake?
You be wise, nigga snakes
Born in May, 80 baby

Legendary, Tyler Perry
Make a movie show to shrug in like I'm Uzi
Smoking kush, got absinthes all in my Jacuzzi
Right on my lip, I'm thinking "girl, mama juicy"
I understand how I don't pull from that fruit tree
...
I'm playing Lauryn Hill when she was with the Fugees
And when they come to doin' this I feel like two-three
Drop a classic on this niggas they come back 'round
We can hear you pussy niggas in the background
Trust the process
Just digest this higher level ways
It's been in my DNA
Undefeated, I'm the great (God)
