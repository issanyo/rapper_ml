[Intro :]
Always, Always
Always, Always
Always, Always

[Hook:]
I'm always getting cash, always keep a bag on me
I always do the dash, you can bet your last homie
Always keep a bad bitch, a lotta ass on her
I let her hold the strap, let her keep the stash on her
Thats always, always
Thats always, always
Thats always, always
Thats always, always
Im always, always, always on the grind
I always got that money on my mind
Chasing money like I'm running outta time
I always, always, always gotta shine

[Verse 1:]
I always keep a stick, got that extra clip on me
I got it on my mind, incase they wanna slide on me
Thats always (x10)
Im always with the clique, always with the shits
Always off a sip, always off a 5th, always kept it real
Yeah, always getting fresh, always gotta flex
Never want the sex, always want the neck, always want the best
Im always on the grind, tryna make another dime
While my youngins in the field, catching cases
It's always about the hustle, always off the muscle
Always dodging trouble, taking chances everyday
Thats always, always
Thats always, always
I'll always keep it trill, always bout a deal
Always give me chills, thinking how we preserve

[Verse 2:]
I'm always chasing comas, always in designer
Always got my momma, always know we gonna be good
I was always in the hood, wish a nigga would
Youngin off the porch, i was up to no good
If they try me right now, we can take it outside
All my niggas in this bitch, its going crazy
If you want me  in your club, before i walk into the club
I ain't coming in, unless a nigga pay me
No I'm always bout a dollar, always popping bottles
Always with a model, nigga I am  making moves
Always got it going, always in a foreign
Always got the hoes, they be repping for the crew
Thats always, always
Thats always, always
I'll always keep it trill, always bout a deal
Always give me chills, thinking how we preserve
