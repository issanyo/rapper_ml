[Verse 1]
Ok, I walk in the party, Mister Swag, so gnarly
With a bad Spanish mami, better ask somebody
Yeah that's my Maserati, going HAM no salami
That's yo chick? If I like it then I'm straight bogarting
In the club, where the bottles? That Ros√©, no Moscato
They see me, models follow, ass clap, ah bravo
I be wiling my nigga
See my jewels they six figures
Fuck your girl and her friend
I'm a dog I do figure
Chilling with my click and I puff that loud
She don't want to fuck then I tell that bitch bye
Heart so cold why waste my time
Twenty on that wrist cause I like that shine
Fuck you niggas who hate on mine
Credit card will not decline
Missionary, no not me, I like that pussy from behind
Bitch I'm ballin' every day it's like somebody pressed rewind
All my niggas came from nothing, mandatory that we shine
Private planein' no complainin' if I happen to recline
Same nigga that they doubted an I'm gladly gon' remind
Made a million of my hunger, that's just solely my reply
Cause we the best, shit ain't a lie

[Hook]
Had to bring the money home
I had to bring the money home
Mo'fucker we on
Had to bring the money home
Mo'fucker we on
Had to bring the money home
Kay, now catch me in your city wit a clique of niggas wit me
Couple bitches gettin' tipsy
Celebrating cause we winnin', we on (x8)
I go so hard, niggas already know
Still in the club when it closed at 4
Birthday girl gon' drop it low
Let's make a toast to never broke
Cause we on (x8)

[Verse 2]
Okay now one for the money, shawty two for the fuck of it
Pull up in on some shit that just might destroy all your confidence
Meet a bitch n' hit it quick n' never know her government
I been rockin' Hermez and that "H" don't stand for hooligan
High boy, I fly high, nigga blast off
You goof, truth, loose, goose. Prove you ain't cotton soft
We on, we on, way to keep on, bring on
All these cases of that aces bring her back to my oasis
Takin' shots after shots like I'm bustin' of that 44
Man, that Ciroc got me feeling like I overdosed
Livin' with my niggas, celebrating, rockin' hella gold
Ring, hella big you would think I won a Super Bowl
Yeah we in the building, why the fuck you think it's super swoll?
Tell the DJ "bring it back" and show 'em what we really on
All these women love me cause they know we young and money long
Mama told me "get it", so I had to bring the money home
