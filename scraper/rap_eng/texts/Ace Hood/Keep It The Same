[Hook]
Keep it the same
Energy don't change, I keep it the same (aye)
Put that on my name
Serving you my truth till I'm laid in my grave
Still I remain
Triple up my profit, you know why I came
Thirty seconds in I'ma know if he lame
Never wash your brain, is a powerful thing

[Verse]
Different from you niggas that played in this game
Level up my conscious, rewired my brain
Left without no options inspired my game
Crown fit me well, it look right with my frame
Smokin' like a chimney, just landed in Cali
Homies gon' pull up, I just text them the addy
Call me up a baddie and roll me a fatty
Salmon with the crab in kale salad
I look in the mirror, I'm jealous of me
I'm just tryna pull in 200 a week
I just want my kids to be better than me
I'm in love with sneakers, ain't takin defeat

[Hook]
Keep it the same
Energy don't change, I keep it the same (aye)
Put that on my name
Serving you my truth till I'm laid in my grave
Still I remain
Triple up my profit, you know why I came
Thirty seconds in I'ma know if he lame
Never wash your brain, is a powerful thing
