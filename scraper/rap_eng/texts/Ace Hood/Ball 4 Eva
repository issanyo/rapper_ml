[Hook]
Family that's starved together
Hustle together, got rich together
We should ball 4 eva
4 eva eva, 4 eva eva
4 eva, 4 eva eva
I pray we ball 4 eva
4 eva eva, 4 eva eva
4 eva, 4 eva eva
I pray we ball 4 eva

[Verse 1]
From the bottom to the top I came so far so I neva stop
Product of my block what a Glock in a black boy wit them locks
Ridin' in the Maybach and we way back how we're looking for far
How the fuck I'm getting this, diamonds cost a couple bricks
Peep the rollie on my wrist, I understand why niggas pissed
Got no time for niggas hatin', I just make some reservation
When they come down to my niggas ain't no sense of hesitation, no
Champagne sipping every night is moving scripted
Hop up in that coop you know that bitch si go to missin
Too much liquor, bad decisions, we're just living like fuck tomorrow
Hit the club and buy it out, like fuck the bar
See them pretty fancy cars, better know what's us
And my niggas do the same thing
I give em a job and they give minds to same way
I pray that we ball forever, we all on the same page
Look, how far we came

[Hook]
Started all broke, penny in my pocket
Tryin to live a dream, accumulate the profit
Now we're getting money, Monday through the Sunday
On another level, my niggas
I pray we ball 4 eva
4 eva eva, 4 eva eva
4 eva, 4 eva eva
I pray we ball 4 eva
4 eva eva, 4 eva eva
4 eva, 4 eva eva
I pray we ball 4 eva

[Verse 2]
I'm ballin my religion, piston my super vision
Flood in Jesus pieces, sorry I'm superstitious
We them niggas who trendin , foreign was neva rented
Choppa clip come extended, for pussy niggas intendended
All these niggas we love and then hate
Government name when I walk int he bank
Ballin bitch Lebron in the paint
Still I ride what half a tank
Most these niggas claiming they real
And when them hard nights and then feel
Meeting my dog got jammed, did bout a couple years in that cell
Now I'm riding off in that aston, kick a whip in that Porsche
India off in that BMW, your next move is that Forbes
Young niggas, young niggas, fuck boys can't run with us
Tuck toys, you dumb boy, that Glock kick like a four wheeler
Ain't two shows in one day, seat recline no PJ
Take a look in my niggas face, oh Lord how far we came
Went from struggle and from finer things
Now is platinum chains and diamond rings

[Hook]
Started all broke, penny in my pocket
Tryin to live a dream, accumulate the profit
Now we're getting money, Monday through the Sunday
On another level, my niggas
I pray we ball 4 eva
4 eva eva, 4 eva eva
4 eva, 4 eva eva
I pray we ball 4 eva
4 eva eva, 4 eva eva
4 eva, 4 eva eva
I pray we ball 4 eva

[Hook]
Money and the power, get it by any means
Real niggas do whip things
I say you're counting all this paper
Bitch we're living the dream
Real niggas do real things
I pray we ball 4 eva
4 eva eva, 4 eva eva
4 eva, 4 eva eva
4 eva eva, 4 eva eva
4 eva, 4 eva eva
I pray we ball 4 eva
