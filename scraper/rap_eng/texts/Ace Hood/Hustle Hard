(I Do It)
Hustle (10x)
Ha!

[Hook]
Same old shit, just a different day
Out here tryna get it, each and every way
Momma need a house
Baby need some shoes
Times are getting hard
Guess what I'mma do
Hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hard
Hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hard
Hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hard
Closed mouths don't get fed on this boulevard

[Verse 1]
Okay, now big bank in my pocket
Double up with my profit
See this shit then I cop it
Gimme that-that there and then drop it
Homie, hold up with my mojo
Peep the whip and that logo
24's and they low pro
I bet she fucking, I know so
Nigga ain't no doubt about it
Riding round with that rocket
Load it up and I cock it
Send bout a couple off in your noggin
Hear them 808's and they knockin'
Whole club and they rockin'
Ros√© in them buckets
All my homies up in here vibing
Nigga big shit in my household
Real niggas I die for
Creeping off in that Tahoe

I be going hard, bitch I'm going hard

You just swipe the card
I'm with a couple latin broads
I just do menage
Fuck you other guys
Pussy telling lies
Homie, free my nigga AG
Fuck you niggas pay me
Swagging in my Saleen
Two-door coupe Mercedes
I am too much for you busters
Bitches I don't trust 'em
Fuck 'em once I fuck 'em
Lust 'em never love 'em
They won't play me for no sucker, play me for no paper
Make my bitches stomp her
Alpha zeta mega, better no-one really on it
Drive it, bet I own it
Money is involved, better know I'm on it
That's wording to my mother
Gotta get it one way or another
I put that on my brother
I'm out here on the come-up
But its-
