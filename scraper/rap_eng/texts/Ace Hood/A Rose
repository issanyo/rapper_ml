[Intro]
Chase the money
Chase the money

[Chorus]
Young nigga come from the basement
Grew like a rose out the pavement
Had to take it back to the basics
Bringing in a whole 'nother cadence
Young nigga keep rocks in the denim
Still hot box in the rental
Still middle fang in the middle
Nigga say he real when I'm realer

[Verse 1]
Young nigga don't prophesize
It's no question
I will be real till the day I die
I been living on the road with the bolds and the gang
Smoke but they know that's the way I vibe
I been feeling so blessed I don't even gotta say out loud
But you can tell in the way I smile
Everything came perfect
I feel my life is worth it
I'm a rich nigga born thirty
Young nigga got paper, I ain't doin' no favours
I don't need new friends, I ain't doin' no traders
Only first day players
Free from the majors, free from the labels
I'm a freak of the nature
I'm a man 'bout mine, I'm a boss at the table
I'm a true to a fable
In a coupe with my zad and seen with a baddie
Just the way I move or fly
Nigga just the way I groove
Young boy get love and respect from the east to the west
On the strength in the way I move
Ain't tryna hear the talk or the nay say
I been really tryna zone in my cente
Tryna get good vibes on the ente
Tryna live like flown you comprende?
You comprende?

[Chorus]
Young nigga come from the basement
Grew like a rose out the pavement
Had to take it back to the basics
Bringing in a whole 'nother cadence
Young nigga keep rocks in the denim
Still hot box in the rental
Still middle fang in the middle
Nigga say he real when I'm realer

[Verse 2]
Young nigga don't prophesize
It's not question
I will be real till the day I die
Ain't never been a fan of the lies
Keep my hand on my 9 even though I believe in God
Everybody wanna flock, acting like they don't see my grind
But wanna stand next to my shine
I understand I'm the man and the goal is to get your shine
But we ain't celebratin' on my time
I'm sick and tired of the leaches
I wanna lie when they reaches
I'm on loud, in the clouds, in and out of the meetings
I'ma fold to the demons
I arrive with the vibe man
Desire to the genius
Putting God on the remix
You can talk that talk, young nigga been working
I'm in a Benz on purpose
Same energy in person
You niggas switch versions
I tried using the verses
That's the way I spill
You could never really fathom
The fact that the way I feel
A boy back doing what I feel
I had to get it on track
Till these rap Gods packing bill
The real deal in the building, for real
Gotta drop it like it's over but still
Them babies holla like we doing it well
Yeah, we doing it well

[Chorus]
Young nigga come from the basement
Grew like a rose out the pavement
Had to take it back to the basics
Bringing in a whole 'nother cadence
Young nigga keep rocks in the denim
Still hot box in the rental
Still middle flame in the middle
Nigga say he real when I'm realer
Young nigga come from the basement
Grew like a rose out the pavement
Had to take it back to the basics
Bringing in a whole 'nother cadence
Young nigga keep rocks in the denim
Still hot box in the rental
Still middle flame in the middle
Nigga say he real when I'm realer
