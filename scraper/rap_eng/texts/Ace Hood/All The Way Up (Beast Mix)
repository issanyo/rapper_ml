[Intro: Ace Hood]
Storm comin'
Go! Hood, Go!

[Hook: Fat Joe]
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up (oh, all the way up)
All the way up (all the way up)
I'm all the way up (I'm all the way up)
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Out in Abu-Dhabi, got twenty bitches off in the lobby
The only Bu I know is the Gatti, ballin' my hobby
I copped the rollie playin' with A$AP, got it Rocky
The jewels all icy, it's likely I'm playin' hockey
I give my chick the work, and I make her twerk on the cocky
I heard they tryna stop me, I'm kickin' shit like Miyagi
Ooh, kemosabe, they think I'm illuminati
I'm still in the cut with them hitta's who catchin' bodies
I know most niggas jealous, I'm coppin' Rolls' with the fella's
My situation developed, I'm on a whole 'nother level
Rockin' new Margiela's, I got this shit out the cellar
Hood Nation forever, I got the juice to propeller
So I'm on the road with the squad, goin' up with the vibes
Watch me run through the money, I'm tryna pass the baton
Tell them niggas who lookin', I'm not that hard to come find
Blow em' up for every second they were sleepin' on mine, nigga

[Hook: Fat Joe]
I'm all the way up (oh, all the way up)
All the way up (all the way up)
I'm all the way up (I'm all the way up)
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Bridge: French Montana]
Shawty whatchu' want? shawty whatchu' need? (whatchu' need?)
My niggas run the game, we ain't never leavin' (never leavin')
Countin' up this money, we ain't never sleep (never sleep)
You got V12, I got 12V (skrrt)
Got bottles, got weed, got models (models, I'm all the way up)
Shawty whatchu' want, I got whatchu' need (need)
Shawty whatchu' want, I got whatchu' need (hah?)
Shawty whatchu' want, I got whatchu' need

[Hook: Fat Joe]
I'm all the way up (all the way up)
I'm all the way up (all the way up)
I'm all the way up (all the way up)
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up (all the way up)
All the way up (all the way up)
I'm all the way up (I'm all the way up)
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up (I'm all the way up)
