Ohh, I need your love, need your love

Tryna get right for the end of the night, shots to the head just to clear my mind
Baby I'mma Sag tell me what's your sign? From the bottom to the top girl you just my kind
I need your love, need your love
(Got my mind so gone bae so what, sho' nuff, wait baby hold up)

[Ace Hood]
Her love shawty know I really need that, can't live without it I need rehab
From the pretty lipstick thinkin' how the waist sit so thick man that ass need a decal
Mayweather wit the stick get the beatdown, throw it back I'mma snatch it like a rebound
Buss that yeah shawty like a Greyhound; what up doe? Lil mama from the D-Town
Girl I need your love it's like fresh air, kick it with a +Young Prince+ like Belair
Just as long as you never do it farewell, they stare but they never get to touch there
See you bad as hell and they know it, fresh up outta the shower with that lotion
Bend it over you might cause a commotion, reminiscin' how im swimmin' in ya ocean
Gone head lil mama, cause the swag up on her with the fly red bottoms
Me & You make sense, get the other boys pissed cause they already got her
Cause I need that love, swear its somethin' like a drug
Come fuck wit a thug, from the bed to the tub

[Hook: Trey Songz] + (Ace Hood)

Tryna get right for the end of the night, shots to the head just to clear my mind
Baby I'mma Sag tell me what's your sign? From the bottom to the top girl you just my kind

[Ace Hood]
That's right shawty welcome to the good life, we can do dinner time if the mood right
On the water with the stars and the moonlight, I deserve that love you the wife type
Make sense I'm a boss and you need that, upgraded hand bags baby Belkins
Credit cards going hard up in Neimans like Cam'ron bae I really mean it
That's my sense of humor and see I'm really like tryna pursue ya but
I know ya last boyfriend was a loser and I ain't lyin' im just way more cooler
I'm a fly young man take you anywhere you wanna im the guy that can
Hopin' for that chance I can give ya my time for ya love in advance
And that's all I demand, so shawty what ya sayin'?
Money ain't a thang lil' mama you can trip to the land we ain't even gotta plan
Put ya feet in the sand then its back to the suite no sleep in the bed
Straight freak in the sheets I'mma beast with the D so deep, Damn

[Hook: Trey Songz] + (Ace Hood)
I need your love, need your love
(Seen her at the mall chillin' wit her ladies, so fine she my hey baby)

[Ace Hood]
Girl you killin' them hoes (I know it), watch you walk by (wait for it)
Yeah that ass lookin' perfect girl look at how you work it, you ain't even have to pay for it (I know it)
Slidin' in that Jeep truck with the doors off, top off, can you take yours off?
Haha, I'm so crazy, ain't that the reason why you love me baby
Girl you killin' them hoes (I know it), watch you walk by (wait for it)
You already that I keep that shit hunnid, fuckin' wit my shades on call me Stevie Wonder
Put it so deep she can feel it in her stomach, dick so good I can tell it when she runnin'
Eyes roll back I can tell it when ya cumin, tongue game mean I can tell that ya love it

[Outro: Trey Songz]
Just tryna get right for the end of the night, shots to the head just to clear my mind

I need your love, need your love
Ohh I need your love, need your love
