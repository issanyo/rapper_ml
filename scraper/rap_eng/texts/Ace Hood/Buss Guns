[Hook: Mavado]
I’m with da million dollar crew
My guns and my bitches coming through
I’m a gangsta fo life
We killers do it right
I buss my guns fo life
I buss my guns fo life
I buss my guns fo life
I buss my guns fo life

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Glock 4-5 on the waistline, you can make a move when you want to
Can’t come in my parts of the city homeboy cus a nigga don’t know you
Keep thinkin I’m playin, he thinkin I’m playin, they thinkin I’m playin
Channel 7 news said a whole lot of people been poppin up dead
Rule number one, we don’t do the police, never talk to the feds
We ain’t gully ridin in a Benz, 2 G’s with they hair full of dreads
Watch them niggas, I don’t like them niggas, I don’t trust them niggas
Got on all my jewelry, in the hood playboy, what the fuck wrong wit him?
On my mama I don’t really get sleep cus a young nigga paranoid
Extendo clips on a gun, motherfucker now the choppa on steroids
Half a million dollars’ worth of whips, young nigga I can show you how to motivate
Ever fucked a bad bitch on a bed full of hunnits? I can show you how to meditate

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Doin bout 100 on the highway, I don’t give a fuck about the po-po
I don’t sell dope but I know a chico who can get it for the lolo
Police aksin me questions, thinkin I’mma talk, that’s a nono
He a never know I got 4,5 bricks, all stashed in the 4 do
I’m feelin myself getting money every day like a young nigga pposed to
Can’t walk in my shoes, take a look in my eyes, you don’t know what I’ve been through
And free my niggas in the state peniten, every day that’s on lockdown
Never gon catch me slip cus you know I’m best friends with the tre pound
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang man you’d think Chief Keef in this motherfucker
And every homeboy around me, man you know I love that nigga like a blood brother
Deerfield Beach, down to the gully
Got love in the hood, respect my nigga, can’t take that from me
