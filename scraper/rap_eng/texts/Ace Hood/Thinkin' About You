I think this ones for the radio
Oww

When the afterparty is over
And everyone around us is leaving
Thats when I want you to come closer
Shawty your the only one that im needing
So when the afterparty is over
And for no particular reason
I want you to pull me in closer
And tell me that tonight you ain't leaving

[Verse 1]
Its 2:30 and it seems like everybody is about to leave
And I can see you reaching out for me
Without a single word I know just what your thinking oww
Im hoping you can stay a little while longer
Cause I like to see that theres chemistry between you and me
Im pretty sure we'll make that good old kind of love

[Chorus]
When the afterparty is over
And everyone around us is leaving
Thats when I want you to come closer (thats when I want you girl)
Cause you're the only one that I'm needing
So when the afterparty is over
And for no particular reason
I want you to pull me in closer (pull me in closer)
And tell me that tonight you ain't leaving
Said I been think, think, think, thinking about you all night
Said I been thinking about you all night
Said I been thinking about you all night
So tell me that tonight you ain't leaving
Said I been think, think, think, thinking about you all night
Said I been thinking about you all night
Said I been thinking about you all night
So tell me that tonight you ain't leaving
Been thinking bout you wooaahhh

[Verse 2]
Kinda ...... are taking the toll on me

So baby you already know just what im thinking, ohhh
Your the only one I wanna feel lady, you got what I need
Wooaaahh you already did your thang to me
Im pretty sure we make the good old kind of love

[Chorus]

[Ace Hood-Verse 3]
I can read a mind like a tarot gypsy
She can be my Cleo, im her pharaoh
Shawty act like she
So when the afterparty is over girl we gon play hard
You and me together in bed all night and day long
Its Ace love, we make love to the same song

[Chorus]

So baby you already know just what im thinking
