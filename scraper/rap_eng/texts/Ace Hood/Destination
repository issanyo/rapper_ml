(Intro)
Ace Hood
Masspike Miles
Wanna talk to the ladies for a second

(Verse 1: Masspike Miles)
Round of applause for the sexy miss
Body to pop 'em and you get it Tess
Subtract the clothes, add in miss the sex
Multiplying to fight it girl
Work it out 'til you break a sweat
I'm doing things that you won't regret
Take your time and relieve the stress
I got what you want girl

(Chorus: Masspike Miles)
She screamin' and
She wally ,wally
Then she bang,bang
Keep on giving it to her
Give it the same way
No need to worry baby
Trust me I'mma maintain
Until we reach our destionation
Oh she wally ,wally
Then she bang,bang
Keep on giving it to her
Give it the same way
No need to worry baby
Trust me I'mma maintain
Until we reach our destionation

(Refrain: Masspike Miles)
Come fly away with me
Sky is the limit
Baby touchdown on extasy
Oh oh oh oh
I'll protect you
No one can love you better
Put your trust in me, in me
Oh baby

(Verse: Masspike Miles)
Heaven on earth
A breathtaking experience
Your kiss got me delirious
Infatuation in it's greatest form
Let's get lost in eachother
Let me stream like no other
Let passion take it's place
As we sin into outspace

(Chorus: Masspike Miles)
She screamin' and
She wally ,wally
Then she bang,bang
Keep on giving it to her
Give it the same way
No need to worry baby
Trust me I'mma maintain
Until we reach our destionation
Oh she wally ,wally
Then she bang,bang
Keep on giving it to her
Give it the same way
No need to worry baby
Trust me I'mma maintain
Until we reach our destionation

(Refrain: Masspike Miles)
Come fly away with me
Sky is the limit
Baby touchdown on extasy
Oh oh oh oh
I'll protect you
No one can love you better
Put your trust in me, in me

(Verse: Ace Hood)
When it came to women told myself I'll never cough
'Til I met you it was like I won a millions bucks
Keep it thriller you the realest bitch I ever touched
Counting paper on the jet we only doin' lunch
This bow shit with a bad bitch
That's staking off for the main dish
She holding on to this sea shit
And dick it out for that tweak fix
I'm taking off, she goin' down
Deep in , she moanin' now
Destination no hesitation
It's my pussy no reservation
Say hell yeah , I meant that
Handbag costs 2 stacks
Damn right, my bitch bad
And that ass on her just so fat
Penthouse on floor 8,wait wait I must say
Know your body been feeding for you like
That shit home,baby

(Chorus: Masspike Miles)
She screamin' and
She wally ,wally
Then she bang,bang
Keep on giving it to her
Give it the same way
No need to worry baby
Trust me I'mma maintain
Until we reach our destionation
Oh she wally ,wally
Then she bang,bang
Keep on giving it to her
Give it the same way
No need to worry baby
Trust me I'mma maintain
Until we reach our destionation

(Refrain: Masspike Miles)
Come fly away with me
Sky is the limit
Baby touchdown on extasy
Oh oh oh oh
I'll protect you
No one can love you better
Put your trust in me, in me
Oh baby
