[Verse 1][x2]
Now any nigga wanna know who I be
I am Ace to the double O D
Keeps it gutta till I D I E
Running them blocks with the real OGs
Come see me if you need that cheap
Fuck them niggas that’s running their teeth
They pop that clip then I’m taking your sneakers
Split your brain, nigga hold that door
Won’t stop me cause I’m running the south
I’m running the streets, I’m running the block
You running your mouth, you meet my Glock
Pop pop pop pop, your body no top

[Verse 2]
So give me your cash, I’m taking your last
You want to be bad, I’m busting your ass
Leave a fuck nigga right there in the grass
Middle finger how we feel
You ain’t heard how we the best and how we run it in the field
Ok, respect the movement, or feel it in your heels
Bring that bitch to your crib like dominos, where the deal
Yeah I got me a deal, but never seen me a mil
So I’m hunting to kill, at anyone in my field
Holler get em, I got em, I let em swallow the steel
Let Khalid warm the cooler, we put them shits on the grill
Yum yum, we at the top of the hill
With that logo straight dangling, tell them strangers we here
