Good girl, gone fuckin' bad
I bet she fuck me good, she askin' "where the party at?"
She beautiful so she get away with it
And all of this in hopes of her making it
Beautiful girl, no matter who you are
Whether you superstar, whether you regular
You know I love you all, this one's for you girl
Yeah, this one's for you girl

[Verse 1 - Ace Hood]
I think I met her 'bout a year ago
College girl, she was a Florida State seminal
Had a job at the mall workin' 10-4
Hella fine, ain't lyin', y'all don't hear me though
So I'm walkin' right up to her, "Hey, my name's Ace"
She replied with a smile and said her name's Shae
Haha, very conservite if I love that
Fitted jeans, rockin' J's and a snapback
Yeah, but I can see that you a killer, girl
See you hot in that physique, you better get it, girl
And you the shit but she don't know it yet
Turnin' red, got her blushin', where ya momma at
Cause all I wanna do is thank her
I'm using "beautiful" and "gorgeous" in the same verse
I swear I'm trippin', you just got me open
And hope that we can get acquainted when I'm highly open

[Verse 2 - Ace Hood]
And I just hope this got you motivated
That's cause your body got me coltivated
Seein' your fine ass around, I just can't tolerate it
And all your friends say I'm a dog, every conversation
Mad cause you're smilin' more on a daily basis
Tell me why they hatin', everything's accomidated
I'm just searchin' for your love, but I'll be very patient
True story, had a theme before we started datin'
Said she never heard "beautiful" so many times
Silly guys approaching with all the wrong lines
That's her reason for being single a long time
And all the roses I sent you, pleasure was all mine
Yeah, women are beautiful in many ways
Confidence sustained, never let it wipe away
What's a man without a woman, I'm just here to say
Haha, yeah I'm just here to say
