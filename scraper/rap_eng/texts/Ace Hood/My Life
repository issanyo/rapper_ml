[Hook: Dane Cash]
I’ve been walking all my life
And I can’t find my way to you
I’ve been praying to the lord I’mma make you see someday, someday
Well if that don’t come home you know I’ll ride
To make it on my own
I’ve been praying to the lord I’mma make you say someday

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Cold world, killings, this crazy world that we living
Got minors thugging and dealing, like fuck authority figures
Was raised up outta Broward, and my momma didn’t raise no coward
Had a job and I worked them hours, my pride would not allow it
Young men holding all that power, I'm dope like fiends with the powder
Came up now the niggas wanna doubt ‘em
In the rows, ain’t talkin’ flowers
Everybody wanna be so sour
You mad cause the shit ain’t ours
Handouts only for them cowards
No college degree at Howard
I came up from the bottom
They so scared I’m getting hotter
We sacking them fuckin’ dollars
Just pray for me, will you mama?
I don' came a long way
Wanna know me? Just listen to what the song say

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
And I told my team that I got us
Never chasing a ho but the commas
Still ball like my nigga Udonis
Do me, never mind your comments
Go hard ain't given no favors
Be around cause a nigga done made it
Where the fuck was you when I needed?
I’m sick and tired of your hatin’
I’m sittin’ cool and I’ patient
And my fans are steady waitin’
Why the fuck I haven’t blew up?
Why the fuck I’m underrated?
I’m the realest thing going
And most of people know it
To my hood I am a god, an illustrated poet
I don’t see no competition
Unless I’m in the mirror
I’m starving in this bitch and I just saved about a million
All my life I’ve been waiting for this moment
But still I’m screaming fuck ‘em
You just shown me my opponent, hold up

[Hook]

[Outro: Dane Cash]
I’ve been walking all my life
I’ve been walking all my life
And I can’t find my way to you
I’ve been praying to the lord I'mma make you say someday, someday
