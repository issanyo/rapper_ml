(Ace Hood  Talking)
Hehehe, see I like all different types of  flavors, you know, Puerto Rican, oh them Spanish bitches be good too
What we doing tonight!?

[Hook:]
I got a few rolled up and my cup half full
I am way too lit and I’m with my woes
I got on designer, got on all this ice
Got that foreign out front and it’s parked outside
We don’t want no problems, though we bout that life
Bring them bad ones through; I’m in town for a night, YEAH!
Shining my nigga, just know that I’m here for the hoes!
I pull up the foreign:  I did it to get me some hoes!
I’m faded, unfadedable, nigga don’t ruin my zone!
You smell the money that’s on me, that’s just my cologne!
I know she with it, cause shorty in love with the dough!

[Verse 1:]
I walked in no talking, just rocks in my watches (whoo!)
All hoes I’m fucking, I can’t even acknowledge (yee!)
Get money, mo money money your college fund in my pocket! (whoo!)
Jealous, they jealous these munchies yee' ain’t got them! (oof!)
Pop a pill and get charged up, how you feel? I give no fucks!
You, you, and your homegirl can meet me in the back of my tour bus!
Young nigga go way up, fuck her good with her legs up!
Came in with yo girlfriend, but I leave with her cause she chose up! (OOH!)
Said she never fucked with a rich nigga (Sorry)
I mean a real nigga, and I know just exactly what to do with her! (YEAH!!)

[Verse 2:]
Fine, and she classy with a little bit of that ratchet!
Not compared to these lame niggas that ain’t even in my bracket!
Money don’t make you real no, niggas be stunting in the rental
Niggas get stuck in the friendzone, me and yo bitch in the Benzo!
And we fly, hop on the flight to Dubai, fuck if you like it or not
Puffin’ the lye, I am considered the guy maybe you must’ve forgot
I want the world, I need the prettiest girl, I want the one with the curves
Give her the word, you know the one you deserve
While them other niggas get curved! (oooh!)
Said she, never got fucked by a trill nigga
Sexy black, eight pack throw the hip in her!
And I know what’s gon’ happen when I’m done with ‘er! (laughs)
