[Intro: Ace Hood]
DJ Scream! (Sonny Digital)
Ace Hood!

[Hook: Ace Hood]
I woke up this morning, mine told me go and get it
First thing, gotta cry, mama told me "boy you trippin"
Gotta go feed the fam, that's my hustlaz intuition
Stay strapped everyday
Fuck you mean? Every second
That's my hustla, hustlaz intuition
That's my hustla, hustlaz intuition
That's my hustla, hustlaz intuition
Hustlaz intuition, the only way I gotta get it

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
OK now, money my priority, that chopper got authority
Wake up early morning, it be sleeping right beside of me
First thing when I wake up, I get my cake up
Hopping up in that wide body, shit feel like a spaceship
Go and get it, every penny outchea like I'm piss poor
3-6-5, round the clock, I hustle 24
Jumping up out that bucket, I'm like "fuck it" it's designer, hoe
4g's on that Aston, pack that 4-door with all kinda hoes
Big business, big shit
Long money, cruise ship
Promised mama and I gotta us rich
Millionaire, they can't tell me shit
Feed the family and my niggas I'm with
You don't feel that, you can suck my dick
Check my mojo, Polo flow
Top missing, oh Marco Po

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
I gotta a fresh bomb of that yes-yes-ya'll
Raw that you're wetting, whip hard
Let it dry and try buying ten pounds
And diamonds bout as bright as ten gods
I got a chopper, do you copy? 10-4
And I'm about to bring it to your front step door
You ain't even gotta take one step forward
Snapping all these pussies like a dumb, deaf dog
I need a pistol and a tweaker
But don't forget the beaker and the ether neither
I got dope in my dirty draws
Ducking crooked cops and dirty laws

[Hook]

[Outro: Ox of Belly]
It's the Ox
When it comes to BGS clean, Mr Bomboclat
Don't you ever bring us to your business again
The hustle live on, street murderers
Make a lot of money, lot going to pumpkin city
Wanna wan I run for them? Uh uh
Wanna wan I run for them, no nah fuck with me
