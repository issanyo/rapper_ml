[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Ayo baby, tell your friends to get with my friends
And we can be friends, this the remix

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, you don’t have to try to read my mind
Cause you know I wanna get it in
And tell me why would we just think about it?
If you want it then I got it
We can be body to body, body to body
I don’t mean to rush you girl
But we should be body to body
Body to body, body to body

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
What it do lil' mama, I was thinking we'd get more acquainted
Baby this the G-mix, we get heated leave them panties ain't it?
She say her last was super wack, his sex was overrated
Gotta give her the good I'm liking the wood and now it's over lady
I give her that pound game, then I slows it up
Nibbling on ya ear, she love that teasing stuff
See you'se a nasty girl, with yo fine ass
If it's wet enough I might just need a wine glass
Ha, I'm super freaky, no top on the 'ghini
No flaw in my diamonds, a house on my pinky
We body to body, I keep me a hottie
She kinky as hell, get it off in the lobbies

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, you don’t have to try to read my mind
Cause you know I wanna get it in
And tell me why would we just think about it?
If you want it then I got it
We can be body to body, body to body
I don’t mean to rush you girl
But we should be body to body
Body to body, body to body

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
You only live once, tonight we do it twice
Tell by your handbag that boy don't do you right
Birking baby, go merk 'em baby
Got some pocket change too, now ya working baby
Got her the Bently coupe, she call that old news
My Tamara Braxton, doing shows too
Paid well, like she supposed to
I'm a made man, I'm into old school
No jewels, which is rough for me
But she's so cool, I kiss her carefully
Emergency room, she was there for me
Right back on my feet, I swear I'd never leave

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, you don’t have to try to read my mind
Cause you know I wanna get it in
And tell me why would we just think about it?
If you want it then I got it
We can be body to body, body to body
I don’t mean to rush you girl
But we should be body to body
Body to body, body to body

[Verse 3: Wale]
If heaven had a height then you would be that tall but
Ya see all we got is tonight and I ain't tryna see that far
All we need is convenient love
And I don't mean convo when I say I wanna know how deep you are
Ha, look
Flower bomb, matter fact she on that bong
You could ask me all you want, but my name ain't oh my god
Passionate in that sack, passionate with this rap
She scratching all on my back, jaw-like fucking up my new tats
Girl work it out, spread it out like word of mouth
You know I'm tryna kill that shit, make sure that urn is out
Now we body to body, go inside and she shaking
Ain't too fond of relationships though my hobby is relation
I ain't really been tricking but Ms. body's persuasive
Keep yo mind out my business, I keep yo body in labels
And I'm stunting, once expired my movements Gordo
My Penn Stated, I ain't lying
Shout out Mr. Paterno, word up, Wale

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, you don’t have to try to read my mind
Cause you know I wanna get it in
And tell me why would we just think about it?
If you want it then I got it
We can be body to body, body to body
I don’t mean to rush you girl
But we should be body to body
Body to body, body to body
