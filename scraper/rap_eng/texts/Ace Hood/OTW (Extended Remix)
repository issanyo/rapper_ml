She's a fine ass [?] make a nigga catch a case
She the type of girl that I like
I swear her body match her face
Last time I left her stranded but she say she got faith
I got a couple moves to make so lil' shawty gotta wait
She got perfect height and perfect weight
She treat a nigga like a chopper and she empty, I'm a plug
Man, she really down for me and I know that she with the shit
'Cause she love [?] all the way legit
Nigga hating, nigga sins, some of y'all need to repent
I'm tryna make a little time
For her, she a dime
I been on my grind, I ain't need to cosign
I ain't need no help, I had to do it on my own
She didn't got me baby she gon' leave a nigga 'lone
(I love her and she text me, boy, how could you be so cold?)

Yo, it's Hoodie, right
And I got your message, missed a call, but know I'm on the way
Go ahead and pop some Chardonnay and add that lingerie
'Cause I need some sexual healing, I'm talking Marvin Gaye

Don't even trip, I just made me a flip
In that Maybach Benz, you sayin' "Ooh boy, look"
Gimme 15 minutes, I can't lie don't let it
On that straight shot Henny, baby, please don't kill me
I'm on the way to you girl, you's a star in my world
You's a G in my book, I'm a drug and you hooked
I'm in that fast lane, blowing Cali kush out the roof
Thinking to myself all this nasty I'm 'bout to do

Shawty really grind, really thug with a nigga
She know I like my steak with no blood in the middle
She got girls on my hip
Girl that's what I'm tryna say
Just left the club vibin', me and molly on the way
You been missing thug love, I can see it in your face
Last time we loved, girl, I felt the tension in your waist
And girl, it been a minute, it been a minute since I licked
If you can, you can find another me you can forget it
We be freaking on the FaceTime up in different cities
I see you, girl, that ass mine, and you gon' get it
Then from late I'm talking, aye, Actavis and ocean spray
When a nigga throwed off, I was dreaming 'bout them drawers
I drunk an eighth, but I'm still on the way
I'm on a state, doing 75 in a 45 with a .45
