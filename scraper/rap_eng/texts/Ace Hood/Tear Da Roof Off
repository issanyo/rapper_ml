[Hook]
Pour up some liquor chasin’ with the juice
I came to party; what you came to do?
I got them Rosé bottles by the bucket
Grab ya dawg and tell him ‘Fuck it, go all out or nothin’”
Tear da roof up off this muhfucka
Tear da roof up off this muhfucka
Shout out to DJ in this muhfucka
Bottles in the air, you ballin’ like a muhfuckaaaaaaa

[Verse 1]
I’m fresh to death and they know this, hoppin’ out of that bimmer
Fresh up out of that Neiman, Marcus rockin’ the meanest
Fly shit with my fly bitch, ass phatter than Trina
Pullin’ up to the club I swear my swagga on a seizure
Make yo bitch Beat Bop the sneaker, she know where to meet us
Bitch I’m not a star, don’t carry no visas
Got them faces in my Levi’s, flyer than your G5’s
Big money what I rely, you are just a peon
And I bounce around, I’m in focus
Rosé is all that we pourin’, smoking all of that doja, standin’ on all them sofas
Tear dat roof up off this muhfucka, man fuck it
Club buckin’ in this muhfucka, just say you love it , huh?

[Hook]
Pour up some liquor chasin’ with the juice
I came to party; what you came to do?

Grab ya dawg and tell him ‘Fuck it, go all out or nothin’
Tear da roof up off this muhfucka
Tear da roof up off this muhfucka
Shout out to DJ in this muhfucka
Bottles in the air, you ballin’ like a muhfuckaaaaaaa

[Verse 2]
Everybody on liquor, homies rollin’ them swishers
Everybody takin’ pictures, seen her friends but I like her sister
Got that ass round and I need it, don’t make me repeat it
Swaggin’ out of this world, confident, conceited
Drinkin’ Rosé after bottles, riiiiiiiight, and I’m with them models
Like I’m ‘thicker than a Snicker’ type, that’s what I like
Tear da roof up off this muhfucka, hey mister DJ, bring it back off in this muhfuckaaaaaaaaa
Yeah, so fuck who got a problem wit it
Got me into my zone, I can handle my own, they not in my division
Gotta pocket full of green, and a Ray Benz black with diamonds yellow, homie
See ya money too small, sorry, you cannot join this ceremony

Pour up some liquor chasin’ with the juice

Tear da roof up off this muhfucka
Tear da roof up off this muhfucka
Shout out to DJ in this muhfucka
