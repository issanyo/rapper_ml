[Chorus]
Money on the floor
Put the Henny' on cold
Put the dice on hold
Put the strippers on the pole
Caught up in the zone
Niggas smokin' on strong
Everybody in they phone, it's just me and you alone
Stuck up in the vibe, bring the elements alive
Set that petty shit aside, too much money on the line
Love it when I'm in, I get love when I'm gone
Put my life in the song
Put the city on, on
The city on, on
The city on....

[Verse 1]
Drophead, park it right in the hood
Got it outta the mud
It's been all in my blood
Locked in, steady manifesting from the most-high
They say the boy reporting live from the court-side
These niggas riding on a wave, like a boat-ride
I like my women independent, I'm a co-sign
No lie
Bad mamma-jamma with a waist all small and her face, "Oh Lawd"
With some jean shorts on
I'm about mine, recognition about time
Name another nigga equivalent, can't find
I'm a one of one
Never second to anyone
It's always us my G, it's never them

[Chorus]
Money on the floor
Put the Henny' on cold
Put the dice on hold
Put the strippers on the pole
Caught up in the zone
Niggas smokin' on strong
Everybody in they phone, it's just me and you alone
Stuck up in the vibe, bring the elements alive
Set that petty shit aside, too much money on the line
Love it when I'm in, I get love when I'm gone
Put my life in the song
Put the city on, on

[Verse 2]
Nigga livin' it up
Youngin' keep it a buck
Nothin' hotter than us, 'Nation
One vibration with demonstration
Watch how I facilitate it, my situation
I'm a dog, I'mma get involved
Stand-up nigga they deserve to applaud
Givin' back love to my old boulevard
Riding in that bucket shootin' shots at the stars
I'mma rise
Niggas switch sides, on God, you better stay there
Foot on they neck, I press, you gets no air
Ridin' in that Maybach, way back, I am relaxed
Niggas saying, "we back, we back"
Better stay there

[Chorus]
Money on the floor
Put the Henny' on cold
Put the dice on hold
Put the strippers on the pole
Caught up in the zone
Niggas smokin' on strong
Everybody in they phone, it's just me and you alone
Stuck up in the vibe, bring the elements alive
Set that petty shit aside, too much money on the line
Love it when I'm in, I get love when I'm gone
Put my life in the song
Put the city on, on
The city on, on
The city on, on

[Bridge]
Everyday I pray, find my way
Fight for your right, for your life
Everyday I pray, find my way
Fight for your right, for your life, for your future's sake

[Chorus]
Money on the floor
Put the Henny' on cold
Put the dice on hold
Put the strippers on the pole
Caught up in the zone
Niggas smokin' on strong
Everybody in they phone, it's just me and you alone
Stuck up in the vibe, bring the elements alive
Set that petty shit aside, too much money on the line
Love it when I'm in, I get love when I'm gone
Put my life in the song
Put the city on, on
