[Intro: DJ Khaled & Ace Hood]
I got every single Air Jordan in the game
We The Best, Haaaah
Air Jordan
Ace Hood, DJ Khaled

[Bridge: Ace Hood]
I say the man at nothing like a pair of new J's
Speaking of em I got on the 9 cool greys
Switching them up like every day those 3's are like my faith
Can't just cop a pair I need a couple I'm in the game

[Hook: Ace Hood]
I got them J's ho
I got the J's though
Same ones that my homie MJ wore
I got them J's though
I got them J's though
Hit up the Flight Club they know what I came for

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Stackin one through twenty-three everything that's on the shelf
Got a room full of J's people think I need some help
I got them J's though, already paid for
I want them Jordan's Mama that's just what I pray for
I remember growin' up watching Jordan on his Bull shit
Look at them 13's and them black and red
And them Space Jams and the patent leather
Shorts on with them 8's on with them tank top and summer weather
Everytime a new J drop I go run and cop cause I new better
Im sneaker freakin'
I got my own homies geekin'
Like where you get em from?
See he ain't never seen em
Them black and yellow 4's
Sold out when it hit the store
I wake up every morning, which ones puttin on?

[Bridge: Ace Hood]
I say the man at nothing like a pair of new J's
Speaking of em I got on the 9 cool greys
Switching them up like every day those 3's are like my faith
Can't just cop a pair I need a couple I'm in the game

[Hook: Ace Hood]
I got them J's ho
I got the J's though
Same ones that my homie MJ wore
I got them J's though
I got them J's though
Hit up the Flight Club they know what I came for

[Interlude: DJ Khaled]
Air Jordan, We The Best Music
Ace Hood, DJ Khaled
One time for Reggie
One time for them Cement 3's
Them Space Jams, Them Breds
I could keep going, I could go on and on
Air Jordan, We The Best, Jordan
