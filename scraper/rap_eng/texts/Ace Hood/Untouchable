[Hook: Nathaniel]
Girl, you're official
You belong with a guy like me, for sure
With no hesitation, all I need is one word
With me, you can't go wrong
We could be the untouchables
We could be the untouchables
Baby, we could be untouchable!

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Ok, white panorama, seats all suede
Bad bitch with me, imported from Malaysia
Red bottom chunky, whole shoes spiked
My girl got a girlfriend, but she ain't even dyke
Introduced her to the life, so beyond nice
40 stories later, I'm penetratin' the pipe
Bottles on cold ice, take it there? I just might
Dream's no longer dreams, the things are in your sight
Put your pass to the side, passports when we fly
Bonnie and Clyde, untouchable with the bond
Yeah, baby, I can take it there
Keep it shinin' like a chandelier
I'm talkin' sweaters, all cashmere
Can't give you the world, but shawty, it be damn near
I got your heart, so tell 'em "Stand clear!"
I got a spot by side, you can stand here

[Hook]
Girl, you're official
You belong with a guy like me, for sure
With no hesitation, all I need is one word
With me, you can't go wrong
We could be the untouchables
We could be the untouchables
Baby, we could be untouchable!

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Yeah, me and you, we untouchable
Good girl gone bad, who corrupted you?
Used to be a college girl eatin' Lunchables
Now your Phillip Lim sweats feelin' comfortable
Arch your back, let me get them from up under you
Car notes, let me get them for a month or two
Block calls, you ain't even gotta wonder who
I downsize, see it's only 'bout one or two
I'm just kiddin', hoes know I'm driven
Dirty birds flyin' out the coupe like a pigeon (yeeughk!)
See, their mission's impossible
My trick game since the 90's been phenomenal
Drop dollars on it, pop bottles on it
Gucci silks got you feelin' like a goddess, don't it?
Yeah, this lifestyle's no fairy tale
A Rolodex of ex-hoes know it very well

[Hook]
Girl, you're official
You belong with a guy like me, for sure
With no hesitation, all I need is one word
With me, you can't go wrong
We could be the untouchables
We could be the untouchables
Baby, we could be untouchable!

[Verse 3: French Montana]
You know who rock jewels, make moves with all the mommas
Back of the club, sippin' Patron is where you'll find me
Back of the Ghost, me and ma bumpin' Chardy
Countin' money fast, and shawty popped an ad
Untouchable for good, now I put it all on her throat
She from my neck of the wood
And, oh, I think I love her
I know she call me Dad, but I gotta thank her mother
I let her kiss the dice, then I play the game
We on the G5's, you on them paper planes
I need a leather Oscar
Untouchable like Kevin Costner, slumber for the Red Lobster

[Hook]
Girl, you're official
You belong with a guy like me, for sure
With no hesitation, all I need is one word
With me, you can't go wrong
We could be the untouchables
We could be the untouchables
Baby, we could be untouchable!
