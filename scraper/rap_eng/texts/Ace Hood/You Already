[Hook: Chinx Drugs]
No top when I roll nigga (you already)
Crib down payment when I throw it nigga (you already)
Had your shot, probably blow it nigga (you already)
Young rich niggas from the East side

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugs]
My young niggas down to trip nowadays
Keep 40 on the wrist nowadays
Somebody should’ve told you that if you love your bitch then you best keep that bitch out my way

[Verse 2: Vado]
Dude living in blue ribbons, lamping with 2 women
Handsome jewels dripping, phantom coupe sitting
Gold timing, ill [?], and crew shitting
Old diamonds still dancing, new edition
You already, seats be all cherry
Winter spring lean, cause some of you fall deadly
Fresh prince with Bel-Air before Geoffrey
Zoning, the We The Best headphones on heavy
I’m too hot, it’s that boom bap
Doug E Fresh at the rooftop
Don’t be fresh get your roof popped
I’m next that’s whose spot on necks and tube socks

[Hook: Chinx Drugs]
No top when I roll nigga (you already)
Crib down payment when I throw it nigga (you already)
Had your shot, probably blow it nigga (you already)
Young rich niggas from the East side

[Bridge: Vado]
By 12, I’m on one
Two just came through
Three of my main dudes
Four door Gran Coupe
Five bottles in each
Six models at least
Never sevens and eights
Just nines and dime pieces

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
You know me, I’m always representing
All this horsepower is purring like a kitten
Always authentic, the windows is all tinted
More bars than San Quentin, on boats with tan women
Flip that shit like Vado
Lift the car door, pistol in console
Jewelry is all gold, bitches is all sold
They looked at my shoes like "Mister, what are those?"
This that Trap-A-Velli shit
'Lo boots, smoking out in the telly
We was rocking RL, We The Best too
I’m allergic to broke niggas, how about chu

[Verse 4: Ace Hood]
Okay it’s mister do it bigger and better, them niggas jealous
Money is the fetish, it’s hustle in my genetics
Supercede your levels I run it in Margiela's
Haters see who run it, we made our way out the cellars
More money is more problems is more better
More choppers and more cars, the pallbearers
Fuck niggas, I’m still the illest in our era
All white coupes, Christina Aguilera
You already, 5 chains, my neck heavy
Bad bitches, they light skinned and tanned ready
Prolly in a mansion, I’m counting it, watching Belly
Now I’m the foreign I used to just want a Chevy
