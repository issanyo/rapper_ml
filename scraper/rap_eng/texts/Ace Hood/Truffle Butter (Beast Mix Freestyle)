[Verse 1]
Yeah, think-thinking out loud
I can name a couple rappers biting my style
But I  ain't even tripping, what's a Bentley to a Civic
Niggas never will admit it, give a fuck if you're offended
Man that boy spitting, see a young nigga winning
Eat you rappers up for dinner, oooh happy Thanksgiving
Oh lord, I'm a top shotta, block cotta(?), the cops got 'em
Promoters tryna to holler, just tell 'em its top dollar
I've been cool with it, I'm thru chillin', a new villain
I'm a lieutenant, you dudes finished, a young Lennox
You a Mike Tyse, you bite-bite, my flow nice
It's a bunch of niggas up in the crowd, you all hype
Why the fuck is they minding? Mind on combat
Bar after bar, what you talking nigga, Klondike?
Nothing never lesser than a mill if I sign that
Try me, Mutombo, oh no, palm that
I'm thinking out loud
I just wanna marry Angela and stay down
Yes Ms. Simmons, you'd get more than just the business
I am true to my religion, I can make your daddy proud
But I'm off that
Half a million in a month though
You owe me money, I'll be banging at your front door
For twenty dollars nigga shooting like they Rondo
Be on your corner every morning like Alonzo
Ooooh, somebody stop that boy
Every chick on Instagram wanna fuck this boy, ha
A nigga abs on fleek, and pause any nigga wanna test my cheat
Dawg I'm a beast, up in VIP, rocking Givenchy, no drawers underneath
I'm a rockstar, she like chocolate I put it in her mouth boy
She use her tongue every inch, I want it wiped off
My jewelry shining so bright you leave the lights off
Ooh, damn, bling bling nigga
Hood Nation the motherfreaking team nigga
Yeah, and I ain't really wanna cuss at all
But ain't no love from the boy, it's just lust involved
Baby mama wanna trip, now the courts involved
Heard you need a little money, now you forced to call
Damn, she don't wanna let me see mine
See all this drama don't fit, I want a refund
Telling lies, cut it out like a coupon
I keep faith, gotta pray, all in due time
But, silly you, that's a poor move
I still ball like the nigga John Wall do
I kick it with some pretty bitches like Kung Fu
It's thirty grand if you want me in your venue
See I'm a motherfucking beast, no nice guy
I get your man X'd out, I'm a cyclops
I don't Kid, no Play, fuck a high top
And still fill twenty holes, screaming fuck cops
Nigga!
Hood Nation bitch!
