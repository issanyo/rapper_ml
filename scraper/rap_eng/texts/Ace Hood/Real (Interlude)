[Intro]
Look what they done did for a real nigga
Look what they done did for a real nigga
They done gave him loyal niggas
They done gave him some real niggas
They done gave him some real bitches
Some bad bitches too, some bad bitches
Look what they done did for a real nigga
Young nigga shredded, young nigga in the gym
Young nigga got the hoes, DM poppin’ like fish grease
Look what they did for a real nigga
Young nigga livin’ this life
Young nigga got money, young nigga got cars
Young nigga got houses, young nigga got it all
Young nigga got money, power, and respect
Look what they did for a real nigga

[Hook]
Oh, look what they done did for a real nigga

Everything exquisite, every day we livin’
My goodness, look what they done did for a real nigga
Look what they done did for a real nigga
Look what they done did for a real nigga
She gon’ bus’ it open, she gon’ do it for me, yeah, yeah
Only one time for a real nigga
I’mma do this shit for the real niggas
I’mma do this shit for the drill niggas
Plenty champagne for a real nigga
A couple gold chains for a real nigga
I pull up in the foreign for the real niggas
Sold out shows for the real niggas
Flooded out Rollies for a real nigga
I wonder is it Heaven for a real nigga

[Verse]
Money never made you a real nigga
I just stay away from them hoe niggas
We are not the same, I am not to blame
Call ya daddy, you was prolly raised by a hoe nigga
Rap game got a shortage of the real niggas
When ya see me, know I’m always with the same niggas
You know that any one of them could have a thang wit ‘em
Don’t make ‘em Chief Keef nigga, bang, bang on ya
I’m in a Wraith with a couple gold chains on ‘em
Suicide doors, Kurt Cobain on ‘em
I’m so blessed, I just gotta keep it real wit ya
A hundred G’s in a week for a real nigga
I’m in some new shit that ain’t even drop yet
Just bought a crib and that bitch look like a complex
I’m in the building, niggas callin’ it a bomb threat
I put them Colorado rocks in the Rolex
I got money, fuck is you niggas lyin’ for?
Don’t you wanna fuck before I start up the convo?
Fill a little glass, illuminatin’ the condo
Hit the strip club, them bitches go get they ponchos, ooh
All this grindin’, nigga all this hustlin’ really started payin’ off
Guess it what it look like the day you get your mind right and be your own boss

[Hook]
Oh, look what they done did for a real nigga
Look what they done did for a real nigga
Everything exquisite, every day we livin’
My goodness, look what they done did for a real nigga
Look what they done did for a real nigga
Look what they done did for a real nigga
She gon’ bus’ it open, she gon’ do it for me, yeah, yeah
Only one time for a real nigga
I’mma do this shit for the real niggas
I’mma do this shit for the drill niggas
Plenty champagne for a real nigga
A couple gold chains for a real nigga
I pull up in the foreign for the real niggas
Sold out shows for the real niggas
Flooded out Rollies for a real nigga
I wonder is it Heaven for a real nigga

[Outro/Interlude]

When y’all see that mothafuckin’ Red Ranger Rover pull up
On them big 6’s, just know that’s a real nigga
And if any y’all niggas think y’all gon’ fuck with my mothafuckin’ nigga
Y’all gon’ die, tryna fuck wit a real nigga
