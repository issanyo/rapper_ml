[Interlude]
Last night when I got up—we've been recording for like thirty minutes
That's—yeah
So what I, what I wanna
What I wanna know is the last
It's a question I forgot to ask
You said like two questions so
If you could give advice to yourself
Like, a younger youth
On how to do this shit, oh
If you had a whole another chance, if you can re-live it
How would you have done it? Like what, what, what steps do, do, do
Not say regret anything but do you think you have done things differently or this was the path that you, you wouldn't have it any other way
