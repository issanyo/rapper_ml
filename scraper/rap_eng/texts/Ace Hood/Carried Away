[Intro:]
You been working your whole life, I just spent $200,000 dollars. On the mothafuckin' coupe

[Hook:]
You working minimum wage, I blew like 20 today
I took my bitch to Crustaceans, I like my steaks n' filet
I put them rocks in the rollie, ballin', I feel like Ginóbili
Order more bottles of Ace, I just might get carried away
I just might get carried away
I fuck that bitch by mistake, I just got carried away
You talk that shit to my face, you can get carried away
I gave them strippers a check, I just got carried away

[Verse 1:]
I got a crib in the Ye, condo thats out in LA
I got a bitch look Jamaican, she look Chinese in the face
She got that booty galore, she got the tiniest waist
She got that yes Lord, I call it amazing grace
That shit you make in a year, I blow it all in a day
I got that 9 on me now, bail money all in my safe
I could’ve cop me the 6, I could’ve cop me the Wraith
We on the run for the money, y'all need to pick up the pace
I feel invincible, I’m on a pill or two, I’m in the club with my whodie’s
I am nothing like the old me, please do not act like you know me
I feel like Steph in the finals, my rivals know they can never control me
I done got high as the nose bleed, oh you still hating? Man, nigga please

[Hook:]
You working minimum wage, I blew like 20 today
I took my bitch to Crustaceans, I like my steaks n' filet
I put them rocks in the rollie, ballin', I feel like Ginóbili
Order more bottles of Ace, I just might get carried away
I just might get carried away
I fuck that bitch by mistake, I just got carried away
You talk that shit to my face, you can get carried away
I gave them strippers a check, I just got carried away

[Verse 2:]
I smoke an ounce in a day, I am not feeling my face
I am rocking Maison Margielas, I mix it up with Versace
I am pronouncing it wrong, I don’t give a fuck what you on
I don’t give a fuck who you call, I got some shit for the mall
I might just wake up and ball, made my hoe gargle my balls
You need a hit nigga holler, I am the one you should call
Crib is a miniature mall, Sunday is miniature golf
Wednesday I’m probably in Yoga, helping me keep my composure
I just get carried away, I just get carried away
I should’ve took all that money and gave it to God, right in the collection plate
But instead I spent it in King Of Diamonds all that ass and titties in my face lord forgive me
Now back to this Henny, gone

[Hook:]
You working minimum wage, I blew like 20 today
I took my bitch to Crustaceans, I like my steaks n' filet
I put them rocks in the rollie, ballin', I feel like Ginóbili
Order more bottles of Ace, I just might get carried away
I just might get carried away
I fuck that bitch by mistake, I just got carried away
You talk that shit to my face, you can get carried away
I gave them strippers a check, I just got carried away

[Verse 3:]
Order more bottles of Ace, then give them bottles away
Then I go order more bottles, you see the look on they face
I think these rappers are clowns, we in the Cirque du Soleil
If she is not is not fuckin' tonight, then she just invading my space
I’m with my niggas and we celebratin' like we won a title today
I’m elevated and I’m underrated but I’m headin' straight to the bag
I just got carried away, VVS karat, the face
This what I think of you niggas who internet thuggin remindin' myself every day

[Hook:]
You working minimum wage, I blew like 20 today
I took my bitch to Crustaceans, I like my steaks n' filet
I put them rocks in the rollie, ballin', I feel like Ginóbili
Order more bottles of Ace, I just might get carried away
I just might get carried away
I fuck that bitch by mistake, I just got carried away
You talk that shit to my face, you can get carried away
I gave them strippers a check, I just got carried away
