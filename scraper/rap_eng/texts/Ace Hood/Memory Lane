[Intro: Kevin Cossom]
R.I.P. to the homies
Take the ride with me, take the ride me

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Man it was just the other day everything was all good
R'member like yesterday, when we were chilling in the hood
Dreaming the bigger things as a younger nigga should
Wanna take care of the fam, we just wishing that we could
Another day and a dolla, steady chasing the commas
Studio went for hours, I'm slapping like a piranha
Only was sanity with loyalty with the honor
Ridin' round in that bubbley, keep that eagle for drama
Man I'd put that on my life that's my motherfucking dog
Anybody want problems? That's the nigga I would call
Just know that he'd come in runnin' with that shit that I cleared them all
Youngin thuggin', he bustin' if you ever played front
Me and 4, 5 of brother feeling like we had done it all
Then one day in the studio is when I got the call
Man it was '09 when I lost my dawg
It's still 'till this day the tears continue to fall
I love ma' nigga see the pain still remains
Know you watching from heaven how far did your nigga came?
So I tatted your name to show you I never changed
Progress to aim, the born will still remain, my nigga

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]
Don't give a damn about the law
I'mma push my luck
Got a few haters so the tool on tough
We got a small circle, all we had is trust
Me and ma dawgs, and all we got is us
Poor a little liquor
Forget about the pain
A lot of niggas in the dirt
So the sky's where we aim
But now we got the money, the power and the fame
All the shit done changed
Now we riding down memory lane
It's just me and my dogs and we riding down memory lane, down memory lane
See in that all white rain, in that all white thang
It's just me and my niggas and we riding down memory lane, down memory lane
And we just riding down memory lane

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
And I just gotta keep it real when I'm telling you how I feel
Talking before the deal when I was back in the field
R'member we used to chill it's real with my nigga Dale
He attend in a school - a student at Full Sail
We visit in his crib a couple days and we bale
Hit a couple of clubs, and dealt a couple of girls, god damn my nigga
Them the motherfuckin' days, lord just tell me why you had to take my dawg
They just wanted this car, they just wanted to ball
He just wanted to leave frightened by what he saw
I was off in the room and waiting my nigga call
When it's the last time that we would even talk
I told em to be safe in the [?] my dough
A couple hours later got an unexpected call
My homie he was crying I knew that it was bad
He told me Dale gone, you're lying out your ass
I call the cell phone but nobody hit 'em back
They say that he was shot down to make it right
He died on the scene that's when I hit my knees
Begging the lord please, heavenly father please
Turn this into a dream, tell me how could it be
Probably because of me, or who he wanted to see
Man, a couple years ago is when I lost my dog
It's still till this day the tears continue to fall
I love my nigga see the pain still remain
Know you watching from heaven, how far did your nigga came
So I tatted your name to show you I never change
Put that shit on my chain, I'm born, it's like a stain ma' nigga

[Hook]

[Outro: Ace Hood]
Gone but never forgot it
R.I.P all the ones be lost
