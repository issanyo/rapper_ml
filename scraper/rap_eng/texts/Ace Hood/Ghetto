Leave my heart to the ghetto, rubber bands stuffed all in up, o yeah, o yeah
Get money (get money), that's the motto
Hustle all day then we do the shit tomorrow
I'm in the ghetto (ghetto), I'm in the ghetto (ghetto)
Gotta get it (gotta get it) that's the motto
Live for today you might never see tomorrow
I'm in the ghetto (ghetto), I'm in the ghetto (ghetto)

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
See I went straight to the pros who done it like me
Breakup the flow now they holla "he a beast"
From the city where there's killers & dealers & street beef
And them crackers on the corner every avenue and place
And my homies servin' hard cause they livin' by the day
See I do it for my family and hustled by the way
Now I'm back up on the block ya see I'm cooler than them others
Certified colored sneakers
Keep a fitted for the club, when I step out on the scene all them hoes be showin' love
They know that I'm the dude that be ringing through the block
Ace, ace, ace, ace
Yeah fool heard it right
I done been down to the bottom now I'm bound to see the top, my hood

[Hook x2: Dre]

[Hook: Dre]
You gotta love ya hood, you need to love your projects, ay get me, get me

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
I got 'em, a couple triple beams, about an ounce of bakin soda
I got that revenue that's hittin' colder than Sammy Sosa, (incomprehensible)
You see growing up I seen a lot of things I weren't supposed
So growing up I lost a lot of people that were closer
That's why I stay up on my grind and only roll with soldiers
I hit the block and serve em everything away from soda, don't fuck with out the soda
Sellin' coke with out the cola, my clientele is strictly rock you can tell it by the odor
I keep that nine with the mac hid underneath the sofa
So if you riding ? tricks I suggest a coma, them pussy niggas want me dead so I suggest and dopa

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Yeah I wake up in the ghetto trying dream a couple mill
I'm forced to get, momma shooting up and popping pills
Daddy on the porch with no remorse he sitting still
This be the city that never pity they would rather kill
I wipe my eyes and check my clientele who by yourself
I grab the pots and baking soda yeah that odor smell
This be the hood I got connections like a phone cable
So watch where you work cause a mistake can be fatal
Cause crakas searching for that person though I'm underable
Can't find no witness, fuck them snitches, that get snitches popped
Another day just talking on the block
With a million on my Glock
And a half off in my sock
