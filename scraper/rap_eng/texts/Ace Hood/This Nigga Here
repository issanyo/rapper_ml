[Hook - Schife]
Gucci this, Louis that, I'm on my designer shit
Presidential top notch, only rock the finest shit
Purple label, new Cavallis, ain't nobody fly as this
Back seat of the double R, I'm on my recliner shit
This nigga here keep a 100 on his wrist
This nigga here keep him a bad bitch
This nigga here keep a customized whip
This nigga here keep a hundred round clip
This nigga here keep it realer than a motherfucker
More ruthless than these other motherfuckers

[Verse 1 – Ace Hood]
I'm in the booth up in this motherfucker
God knows I spit the truth to all these motherfuckers
I tell them workin' don't get paid up in this motherfucker
Grab you a [?] and go get laid up in this motherfucker
I roll up, niggas bow down
Bitches show up, they wanna bow down
My money too extravagant to handle it
And I'm arrogant as fuck, me, I'm the one who handle it
Every corner that you got under new management
We get the money, burn it to the ground, y’all can have that shit
Yaoue team pussy, I'm a go and damage it
Leave a hundred shells outside your house, nigga handle it

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Ace Hood]
Round 2 up in this motherfucker
Fist full of cash, stunting in this motherfucker
Grab a bitch and tell her she comin' with all of us
Then tell her go and get her friend for my god brother
We got money and we finna shut the club down
Ace Hood? Pussy nigga ask around
You come to my city? Hottest in the town
Niggas got a problem? Meet my chopper rounds
AK47, leave ya body down
I know you heard, but we showing out in every town
I keep that Louis dripping on me when I puts it down
They holler "This nigga here, he a fuckin clown"

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – Birdman]
50 on some Gucci, 50 on the rag, 100 on some Louis, 100 in the bag
100 and the whole dashboard gold, platinum on the teeth, cherry red roll
You know the money swole, a nigga never folds, presidential sweets, Italian marble floor
20 million on some new shit, new houses, new whips, all new shit
New bitch, mandatory keep a new lick, new clips, hollow tips for the bullets
Stunting on these bitches see we do this every summer, pull out the hummers
Calli for the runners, sun do shine
Shine on the sun, make another mil, spend another hundred
