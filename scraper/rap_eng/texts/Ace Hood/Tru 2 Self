[Intro]
Beam me up Scotty
Beam me up Scotty
Beam me up Scotty
Beam me up Scotty
Beam me up Scotty..

No, I won't change
No, I won't change
I won't change

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Sometimes, I be feeling like "Fuck rap"
Cause ain't nobody interested in all this real shit
Real
But that be going through my mind on some real shit
Like why this nigga heavy underrated?
My shit got niggas steady contemplating
I'm trying to find the patience
Trying to find our answers on a daily
I think it's time we have a conversation
But I got limitations
That's probably why I'm in this situation
These rappers just a bunch of imitations
I'm getting too impatient
I'm thinking, should I'll make a reservation?
Probably only way a nigga make it
But that ain't true
Look at Cole nigga, that's your proof
Overdose on autotune, nigga that ain't you
Sell your soul, that's kinda like you said "I do"
I won't budge, I can't lie
This shit gets tough
To all my fans, I promise you can call my bluff
Don't ever want to break that trust
For real

[Hook: Ace Hood]
And I won't change
No, I won't change
No matter the fame
No matter the name
I'm true to myself
And that won't change
No that won't change

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
They like, Ace why you never mentioned in the media?
Why that nigga treat you like you needed him?
Polo in a medium
Niggas gassed up like the helium
What's that 87 to a premium?
He don't get to shine
He don't get the love that he deserve
This shit is getting on a nigga nerves
This shit is too confusing
All of these illusions
Kevin Hart, funny man, these rap dudes, amusing
For the love of music
Gold chains, cubans
Rollie on the wrist, I'm a product of abusing
That's real shit
Trying to rush the rap game, like I called blitz
Made a couple mill, I ain't satisfied yet
Shit
I'm more focused on my legacy
How I can aspire gon' require up a better me
So who am I? Be that shredded motherfucker
You should get to know him, even love him

[Hook: Ace Hood]
And I won't change
No, I won't change
No matter the fame
No matter the name
I'm true to myself
And that won't change
No that won't change

[Bridge: Ace Hood]
No matter how high or low
I would never ever sell my soul
Say no matter how high or low
I would never ever sell my soul, no

Cause we up, we up, we up, we up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Cause we up, we up, we up, we up, yeah
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
I'm a problem
I will not ever follow
I will not ever bother to change and switch up the motto
I'm true to what I believe
Them blessings will be received
Supporters will be relieved
To see what we have achieved
That's that inspiration
So no matter what the world might say
I am god fearing, working on myself everyday
But that's okay
I know we all made some mistakes
Nobody's perfect
We all got them demons to face
Bad time or good times
Man I still give thanks
Ain't no such thing as dog I can't
Ain't no such thing as dog I can't
You feel me?

To all my fans, I promise you can call my bluff
Don't ever want to break that trust
For real

[Hook: Ace Hood]
No, I won't change
No, I won't change
No matter the fame
No matter the name
I'm true to myself
And that won't change
No that won't change

I'm still true to myself
I'm still true to myself
I'm still true to myself

And that won't change
No that won't change
