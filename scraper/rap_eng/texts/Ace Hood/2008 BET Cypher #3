[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
No one on the corner has swagger like this
Cause I'm so incredible they not compatible to me
Eat 'em up like I was Hannibal, the cattle to a beast
Graduated from the hunger now it's rappers that I feast
And I'm coming for each and everyone of you that said I couldn't do
Now I'm swergity swagging on you bums doin' this interview
Call it an interlude, talking to you inner fools
Got nominated, I know they hate it, they sick of dude
But if you sick of new, I feed the lamers Theraflu
Get em man and buy a coupe and drop the roof
Adjust the cruise, show them what the swagger do
It's on the highest altitude
They can't fit my sneaker shoes, the best rapper attitude
See the younging in the zone
The beaches, see the features on my faces I can't erase because my swagger so amazing homles
Catch me at the top
I'm throwing Big J and hot metal
Balling like I'm Karl Malone
The next best is on!

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
There's only two men I fear when it comes to a battle:
God and my shadow
Everybody else get a ravelled, tangled, mangled, totally disabled
Hung from a roof watch 'em dangle
Then I make his wife feel the pain too: anal
Juelz Santana, forget those busters
The boy flows harder than Kimbo's punches
You boys betta step aside, before I get at guys
You just bugs I'm spittin' that pesticide
Your not mobsters, wait stop the fake, or get found dead with your head in that pasta plate
Money in the bank I benefit from my benefits
I'm making it while I'm spending it
You go to the Louie store, you go to the Gucci store
You go to the mall spend it all what you do that for
You could buy the rags, you could buy the bags
But there ain't no sign that say they sell swag
But you could watch me and do your best imitation
You need a little time, a little preparation
But sooner or later your gonna have to face it
I like a pent house, your a fixed up basement
As far a chicks go I get it you take it
I give 'em all Franks, they call me Nathan's

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Lyrically it don't matter, up-and-comer or a has be
I'm in your ass B who’s the next Raz-B
Wordplay king I'm not the one to Scrabble with
The rocks got more carats in it than rabbit shit
And after these ill lines, you might see why I need a deal sign
Cause everybody coming in this year is failing
Ask why and they just play Sarah Palin
I'd rather be in Maui para sailing
Cause when you in the lead you don't care who’s trailing
So get your little money you isn’t a threat
When we was making it rain you wasn’t drizzling yet
Right Meech? Death before dishonor
Their swaggers like mine cause I left it on the corner
So fly I gotta shop at the Sky mall
And this summer we getting more drops than eyeballs
Loso!

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
I told you this once Hip Hop is not dead
Change gon' come, just like Barack said
"Money, Power, Respect" like The Lox said
"You'll be the man of the house", my paps said
Heat the streets up, right quick it's all timing
Gucci everything, Sierra Leone diamonds
You could know so much yet but no nothing
If I don't know nothing else, bet I know hustling
This ain't even a rhyme, it's a controlled substance
Strictly iron swinging, no tussling
I just do business I don't do friends
Brand new M1's and 9mm's
As long as money's involved with it I'm in
You ain't gotta second guess the best, I'm him
I will rap circles around these new urkels
Everything is digital, pills are still purple
So I'm staying in my lane 'til it opens up
I'm like a sponge in the game just soaking up
Log on, I deserve a hit
I know you heard of Kiss
This is the cypher, I murdered it!
