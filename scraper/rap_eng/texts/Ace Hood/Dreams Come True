[Intro: Birdman] + (Yo Gotti)
(Yea!) Birdman, pussy
Sittin' on this muthafuckin' hill
(Rich Gang, billionaire status)
All day! One hundred

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
I believe dreams come true
I believe dreams come true
I believe dreams come true
Close my eyes woke up in that Bugatti coupe
That bitch ain't got a roof
This 1.5 on a coupé
Rich Gang, nigga dreams come true
Bad bitch, I make her dreams come true

[Interlude: Yo Gotti] + (Birdman)
Rich Gang, nigga dreams come true
Dope boy, I'm a dream come true
(Big Gang Millionaires, nigga)
I believe dreams come true

[Ace Hood]
Ace Hood, dat right
Hood Nation, OG, whattup doe?
You already know...

I believe dreams come true
Can't wait for the Rolls Royce to make the coupé (can't wait)
I'm lying on a mil, that's the truth (yea)
Spent five thousand dollars on some shoes
That's what you call stuntin'
I turn in none, ran into my freak bucket (oh word)
Then turn a pussy, ran into my cute puppet
No ventriloquist, I make it talk to me (Hi!)
I'm the richest nigga in my hood
10 chains on me, smoking Cali good
Private plane luggage never necessary
I can take you where they never could
That super fly shit is mandatory
Chasing all this money, I just can't avoid it
Jesus pieces only keeping me anointed
Getting richer, niggas highly disappointed
But umm...

[Hook] + [Interlude]

[Mack Maine]
And I done seen dreams come true
Bentley truck 'bout to drop, give me two (haha)
Presidential rollies for my whole crew
Me and Bird see the world through a bird's eye view
Man we started from the bottom now we here (yea)
GT V bottles at the table, no beer (ya heard?)
Hustlers' my career, never had fear
I'm flying on a lear high, rest in peace Aaliyah
Man I spent 3.5 Million on a crib
Young Hot Boy, had to get how I live
The main question is, why am I always smiling? I'm living
I was born with the drive, now a nigga get driven
Young Money

[Hook]

[Birdman]
And I done seen dreams come through
11 hundred catana, sock on the new shoe
Moving birds out the coupé
The sun do shine, we can knock him off for the loop (BLAAAT~!)
Stunna Island out the pound homie
Stunna Island with my rounds homie
Moving eleven, strapped with a mack
A hundred G's in a dufflebag stacked
White doves, and we serving out of Bentley
Uptown, moving round, now we filthy
Paint the whole town
Red on that brown, lay 'em all down (BLAAAT!)

[Hook] w/ Birdman ad-libs

[Outro: Birdman]
Yea!
Party never stops, nightlife poppin'
Take that shit to the mansion nigga
Stunna island where we hold it down, put it down
One hundred
