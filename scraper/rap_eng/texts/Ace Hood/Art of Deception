(Intro)
Yea, Ace Hood
Feel me?
What?
Damn
People

(Hook)
Everything that shines ain’t a diamond
Tomorrow is a gift that ain’t promised
Nobody’s perfect, we all need alignments
And things are understood more with time and
If I die would you miss me?
If I fall would you lift me?
I swear life is such a mystery
I’m livin to become a part of history

(Verse)
Look in the mirror I can see your shame
Know you’re hurt but I don’t know your name
See you smile just to cover pain
While you patiently waitin for change
Tears runnin like a faucet
Hear the whispers as they gossip
Pretty girl with a cold heart
Life is like a script, she just playin the part
Love found in the wrong place
Self-esteem at its lowest rate
Mama gone, fuck her whereabouts
Plenty sold dreams, man in and out
Ain’t seen her dad like in 7 years
So she usin drugs just to try and heal
If I fuck you would you promise to stay?
She don’t know no other way
Bad bitches in my living room
Mind thinkin I’mma get it soon
Thinkin all the ways I’mma get that
Long legs, I’mma have em pinned back
Pretty as a summer day
And cold as a winter night
I pray that every soul gets to shine bright
Lord knows when the time right

(Hook)
Everything that shines ain’t a diamond
Tomorrow is a gift that ain’t promised
Nobody’s perfect, we all need alignments
And things are understood more with time and
If I die would you miss me?
If I fall would you lift me?
I swear life is such a mystery
I’m livin to become a part of history

(Verse)
Mama told me
Hard head make a soft ass
Dollar bills make a poledance
She ain’t interested in any romance
Better come and get with the program
How was life when yo daddy gone
Only daughter, she bein let on
How the character know she dead wrong
Facin karma, it’s comin head on
She think she grown, only 17
Whole world that she never seen
Many men have travelled in-between
Said he love er then flip it like it’s a trampoline
Cold world, keep your sweater close
Doin' 40 in the Phantom Ghost
Keep the ones who you love close
No assuming but you just never know

(Hook)
Everything that shines ain’t a diamond
Tomorrow is a gift that ain’t promised
Nobody’s perfect, we all need alignments
And things are understood more with time and
If I die would you miss me?
If I fall would you lift me?
I swear life is such a mystery
I’m livin to become a part of history

I’m livin to become a part of history
