[Chorus]
They said it, they said it
And they said it
And they said I would never be shit
And they sayin' I will never beat this
And they sayin' a nigga fell way off
And they sayin' a nigga way too raw
Yeah, they sayin' it
They sayin' it
They said it
They said it
I'm a legend
I'm a blessin'
Are you still with?
No more questions
They sayin' it
Yeah, they sayin' it
They sayin' it (ooh)

[Verse 1]
Clearing my mind
I'm outta my head
Real niggas countin' on the boy now, stickin' to the basics
Screamin' he the one, he the one, like a young nigga feelin' like the Matrix
Think he got a gun, got a gun, like they boy quarterbackin' for the Patriots
Went and bought a Draco, soldier
These niggas snakes like cobras
These niggas sleep need Foldgers
Benzo coupe white coka
Been had a bounce on the beat like
Go and get the money everyday like
Then I pull off in a coupe, come get your lady, your boo
She on my D-I-C-K in that V-I-P, it ain't no secret about who got the juice
They keep on rappin' about it
Frequently keep the deposits
I'm rollin' joints with the pilot
We threw your tape in the garbage

[Chorus]
And they said I would never be shit
And they sayin' I will never beat this
And they sayin' a nigga fell way off
And they sayin' a nigga way too raw
Yeah, they sayin' it
They sayin' it
They said it
They said it
I'm a legend
I'm a blessin'
Are you still with?
No more questions
They sayin' it
Yeah, they sayin' it
They sayin' it (hey)

[Verse 2]
Thought it was over
Kept my composure
I seen this since the beginning, the funny thing is that I told ya'
Fuck all the critics
Fuck all the gimmicks
Fuck niggas feelings if they feel offended
Ain't no pretendin' when I'm in attendance
My heart is replenished, my soul has ascended
Who wanna war with the best?
You are not safe with a vest
I'm coming straight at your neck
Shoot and reload for the next
I never ever complain
I never placed up the blame
I was detained, they throwin' dirt on my name
They tried to put me to shame
All in the game
I use that doubt as the floor
I had to switch up the Rolls'
I got the cure, all of the shit I endured
Most of these rapper maneur, talkin' like ugh
These niggas fresh out a sewer, I just got back from the jeweler
I can't relate to the losers
I'mma go harder than usual

[Chorus]
And they said I would never be shit
And they sayin' I will never beat this
And they sayin' a nigga fell way off
And they sayin' a nigga way too raw
Yeah, they sayin' it
They sayin' it
They said it
They said it
I'm a legend
I'm a blessin'
Are you still with?
No more questions
They sayin' it
Yeah, they sayin' it
No
