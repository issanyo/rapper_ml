[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
See, I done came a long way, just to make it here
I’m proud of me, ain’t no apologies, I make it clear
I’m the hottest, ask them niggas ‘bout him, they could not compare
What’s hyenas to a bear? See a beast when I appear, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we’re here
David Blaine, nigga, make your wifey disappear
Pockets full of dead people up in Club LIV
Thinkin’ about my journey made me want to shed a tear
Lost so many niggas, man, I wish that they was here
And I remember them nights I couldn’t find a decent meal
Prayin’ every night that I could make it out the field
I cried a hundred tears on the day I got my deal
Oh Lord, them pussy niggas was hatin’ from the jump
‘Cause they know I run my city, Forest Gump
And my pockets sittin’ on Professor Klump
Broward County on my shoulders, homie, you ain’t gotta front
I get the shit right off the deck
Ain’t tryna make a friend, I’m just tryna get the cake
And plus my daddy left, I took the choice to make a way
And now my mama livin’ far away from Section 8
And now you haters mad, I can see it in your eyes
Cut off some old friends, they the devil in disguise
Addin’ up this money, me and my niggas won’t divide
Chillin’ at the top, coolest place I will reside
Pussy nigga, what?!
Fell off and I bounced back
Within a month I made a hundred racks
Hustle hard, what’s the word, love?
That Bugatti fucked the club up
Now it’s 25 a show, nigga
It’s ‘bout time for me to show niggas
Music biz birthed a lot of ho niggas
Still keep it humble, seein’ no nigga
Started from the bottom, boy
Started from the bottom, what?
Me and my niggas came up
Million dollars up…
Nigga ridin’ around in them half-a-million-dollar cars, nigga…

[Outro: Drake]
Started from the bottom, now we’re here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin’ here
Started from the bottom, now we’re here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we’re here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we’re here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team fuckin’ here
