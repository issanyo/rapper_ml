[Intro]
Ayy

[Hook]
Head honcho, I'm the head honcho
I make it rain, bitch, go and get ya poncho
See me flexin', tell 'em, "Welcome to the gun show"
Head honcho, I'm the head honcho
Head honcho, I'm the head honcho
I make it rain, bitch, go and get ya poncho
See me flexin', tell 'em, "Welcome to the gun show"
Head honcho, I'm the head honcho

[Bridge]
I jumped out the Porsche, I hopped in the Lamb'
I'm chasin' the bag, that's all for the fam
I stand on my feet, for what I believe
My loyalty deep, that shit that I bleed

[Verse 1]
I got no regrets, I'm here in the flesh
You wish that I fail, I wish you the best
I count up all my blessings, I count up the check
You playin' with checkers, I'm playin' with chess
You outta you league, I'm super supreme
My pistol is dirty, new whip is too clean
My hunnids are blue, won't fit in my jeans
Margiela, Margiela, don't ever compare me
That hatin' adjourned, don't bring that shit near me
No slippin' on pimpin', I want it, I get it
My savage the vicious, my queen is the thickest
They see me salute me, soon as I walk in the buildin', ayy

[Hook]
Head honcho, I'm the head honcho
I make it rain, bitch, go and get ya poncho
See me flexin', tell 'em, "Welcome to the gun show"
Head honcho, I'm the head honcho
Head honcho, I'm the head honcho
I make it rain, bitch, go and get ya poncho
See me flexin', tell 'em, "Welcome to the gun show"
Head honcho, I'm the head honcho

[Bridge]
I jumped out the Porsche, I hopped in the Lamb'
I'm chasin' the bag, that's all for the fam
I stand on my feet, for what I believe
My loyalty deep, that shit that I bleed

[Verse 2]
I'm hot as the devil, I roll with the metal
She diggin' my vibes, I roll with the shovel
Put ice in my bezel, you ain't on my level
I roll with the rebels, who kept it together?
I beast in the booth, I beast in the gym
I smoke on the ooh, I dip in a coupe
Your ex is the truth, God bless me, achoo
I'm rollin', I'm rollin', can't keep my composure

[Hook]
Head honcho, I'm the head honcho
I make it rain, bitch, go and get ya poncho
See me flexin', tell 'em, "Welcome to the gun show"
Head honcho, I'm the head honcho
Head honcho, I'm the head honcho
I make it rain, bitch, go and get ya poncho
See me flexin', tell 'em, "Welcome to the gun show"
Head honcho, I'm the head honcho
