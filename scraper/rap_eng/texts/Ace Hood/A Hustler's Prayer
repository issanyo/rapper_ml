[Intro: Ace Hood]
I rebuke the devil away from me
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Pray for me mama
Live, Starvation

[Hook x2: Ace Hood]
If I should die before I wake
I pray and ask the lord for my soul to take
Niggas dyin’ everyday so I keep that Glock on me
I’m just thankful I woke up to see another day, hey-ey-ey

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Man I’m sick and tired of this bullshit
And I lost my dawg and I felt like this the worst that it could get
Till I lost my daughter, felt like emptyin’ out that full clip
And I put it on mama, fifth o' the Hen, I’m just gonna slow sip
Cause I’m way to stressed and again I’m blessed because I’m still here
Lookin’ in that mirror I can see a man with no fear
Oh lord, oh lord this world is hell although we livin’ in it
Gotta keep my bible, why, oh why must I just keep on sinnin'?
Tryin’ to keep it real in a world so fake, now can I get a witness?
Got niggas killing over Jordan’s, gettin' life in prison
I’m tryin’ to tell you man
Watch the ones who you hang around
The enemy approaching any second now

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Woke up early in the morning, said I gotta get it
Loaded up my pistol, I just pray that all my sins forgiven
And I know I’m livin’ wrong but mama, you just pray for me
Gotta make this money so my family forever eatin'
That Jesus piece around my neck keep the devil away from me
In an old school cutlass keep that problem with me on the seat
Just hope I'm right put the man above before I go to sleep and
Ain't nothing lesser than a G, that’s how they bury me
Have mercy on ‘em
If I should die before I wake
Pour me out some liquor when you’re at the wake
And I’ll be good as long as I know daughter’s straight
Realest shit I ever wrote, this is a hustler's prayer

[Hook x2]
