[Bridge]
We born bad, you nuh haffi ask me
Run up inna the bank, "A weh the stash deh?!"
Dem gyal yah better send on the money, before me shoot off every Haskell

[Hook]
Same old shit, just a different day
Out here tryna get it, each and every way (So bad)
Momma need a house
Baby need some shoes
Times are getting hard
Guess what I'mma do
Hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hard (Everyday!)
Hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hard (Every night!)
Hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hustle hustle, hard (Hustle hard)
Closed mouths don't get fed on this boulevard
(Know say the struggle hard...)

[Verse 1]
Okay, now big bank in my pocket
And no fool can-cannot stop it, yeah
Dem better send on the dough before man haffi knock it
Dem a inch pon Creep with the food, so me buss off dem head with the rocket
When time me clap it...
A the depths of the savings me haffi go
Hot grabba me burn inna the bank, so you know skull, it is hot, enuh
The rifle one time, everybody inna the bank is flat, enuh
A security a guard fi buck up, when me look, Dinearo a shot him up
"That cash is not enough, put some more pon that, enuh!"
And turn off all the cameras
Tie up all the managers
We got a few garbage bags, tell dem boys to fill it up
Else we gon' shoot it up
Nah, I don't give a fuck
Why?
If the cops show up...
Jail is not for us
'Cause Creep pull up inna the Audi
We know say the Feds can't grab we
The one Niko have a dirty habit fi make informers vomit

[Bridge]
We-we-we-we born bad, you nuh haffi ask me
Run up inna the bank, "A weh the stash deh?!"
Dem gyal yah better send on the money, before me shoot off every Haskell
