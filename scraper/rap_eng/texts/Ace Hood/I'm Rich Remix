[Intro Red Cafe]
Shake down
I got a tatted up bitch
Pissing on her titties
Louis bag YSL
Baddest in the city
That girl ass juicy
She got me getting trippy
She get freaky for the boss
She know I ball silly

[Intro hook]
Look I'm rich, I'm racked up, I'm strapped up, I'm rich
My car fast, My bitch bad, I'm rich
I grind hard, I play hard, I'm rich
Fuck y'all I'm rich
Fuck y'all I'm rich
I'm racked up, I'm strapped up, I'm rich
My car fast, My bitch bad, I'm rich
I grind hard, I play hard, I'm rich
Fuck y'all I'm rich
Fuck y'all I'm rich

[ Red Cafe's Verse ]
And i'm faded
All the cars and wardrobe the latest
And the bottles coming non stop
Started from the bottom but a nigga still made it
Shake down mother fuck these haters
Roll up finna smoke of my papers
What it do though
I'm a fool though
Got the new Hublot car move blow
Back home from the district red light
Three chicks at a time one red light
Act crazy I got gunners
Got work and we doing numbers New York what
All my chicks swagged out
Out in Vegas i cashed out
Threw my forty five racks out
Then i poured up till i passed out

[ Hook ]
Fuck y'all I'm rich, I'm racked up, I'm strapped up, I'm rich
My car fast, My bitch bad, I'm rich
I grind hard, I play hard, I'm rich
Fuck y'all I'm rich
Fuck y'all I'm rich

[ Ace Hood's verse ]
Okay now all hail to the king nigga
Glock forty's my pain killer
I ain't stunting on pussy niggas
Go and ask your bitch if she's seen realer
I'll give her back when i'm done with her
Suck it dry she's a babysitter
I'm at Anguilla eating conchfritters
And i'm smoking killer in a fly villa
I ain't new to this bitch i'm to legit
If i'm driving dog then its the latest shit
I ball hard on my bull shit
I'm like Micheal Jordan back in ninety six
I Stevie Wonder i don't see the shit
Probably hit your girl but i plead the fifth
Got the sky dweller for the time teller
Got a rich taste like a Wine Cellar

[French Montana's verse]
Bitching nigga crib inside the Central Park
Blowing money like i'm slanging Dope and Balling mall
If that pussy whack then i probably never call tomorrow
If that pussy good then i'll probably buy the bitch the mall
Heat game floor seats fuck that call the law
Alley-opp Fast Break could have stole the ball
Blowing money fast like i'm Rafael Andrews
Kill that pussy tell that ho go and call the reff

[ Jeremih's verse ]
Fuck y'all niggas counting other niggas figures
Better know a niggas rich
I know your money too short
And i be on the west coast just throw your bitch
I heard about you suckers
Y'all be chasing after money
I be running to the Chase
Now i got so much new fan
I'm like bitch get the fuck out my mother fucking face
Soon or later i'm a check a hundred
Assure you i'm the hottest of this R&B shit
And they know it
That bitch like my money
And my weed she blowing
In giuseppes sitting counting paper where Jamaicans be going
Take a trip too shorts make it rip double that
Make it flip Bankroll
Bless me i don't even need a handkerchief

[Hook]
Fuck y'all I'm rich, I racked up, I'm strapped up, I'm rich
My car fast, My bitch bad, I'm rich
I grind hard, I play hard, I'm rich
Fuck y'all I'm rich
Fuck y'all I'm rich
I'm racked up, I'm strapped up, I'm rich
My car fast, My bitch bad, I'm rich
I grind hard, I play hard, I'm rich
Fuck y'all I'm rich
Fuck y'all I'm rich
Fuck y'all I'm rich
Fuck y'all I'm rich
