Yeah I'mma live by the code, I die by the code
Be a real nigga till my casket door close, huh?
Live by the code
Yeah I'mma ive by the code
I'mma live by the code, coulda went to school, this the life I chose

Chorus

I'mma live by the code, I die by the code
Keep it 100, never snitchin' on a soul
I'mma ride for my niggas, until my eyes close
In love with the money, I dont love these hoes
I solemnly swear
I solemnly swear
I solemnly swear
I solemnly swear
I'mma live by the code, I die by the code
I be a real nigga till my casket door close, huh?

Verse

Now twelve years old, mama in the kitchen
Told her if my brother went to jail, I'm never snitchin'
She said "boy go wash them dishes!", she must think I was trippin'
Twelve years later, boy I still hold my position
Just that G-code in me, won't let no pussies get me
I go to court, I'm drunk as fuck, I'm stressin' on that Remy
I hit the stand, I raise my hand, and all yall against me
The judge man trippin', tryna give my youngin's twenty
I'm like "No sir your honor, I don't know any gunners
Don't know when and where, and who it was, that's such a bummer
We good?"
I'mma live by the G shit
And I solemnly swear to keep a bad bitch

Chorus

I'mma live by the code, I die by the code
Keep it 100, never snitchin' on a soul
I'mma ride for my niggas, until my eyes close
In love with the money, I dont love these hoes
I solemnly swear
I solemnly swear
I solemnly swear
I solemnly swear
I'mma live by the code, I die by the code
I be a real nigga till my casket door close, huh?

Hold up
Park the Chevy hopped in the back seat or somethin'
Seats reclined, curtains closed, they ain't seen me coming
Black jack, no even money
You act bad, you gon' get your ass whacked , while I'm beating somethin'
Yous'e a lame, yous'e a lame
If you get hit, you gon' rat, with your punk ass
Steady putting on, like you on that
I got an AK and a chrome Mac, with a shoulder strap, thats gon' clap
With a soft trigger, that stall niggas, every time I hold it back
I done lost too many niggas to be slippin'
Now I dont even fall asleep around these bitches
And it ain't no secret, these niggas out here snitchin'
And them bitches are the ones who are considered the realest, damn

Chorus

I'mma live by the code, I die by the code
Keep it 100, never snitchin' on a soul
I'mma ride for my niggas, until my eyes close
In love with the money, I dont love these hoes
I solemnly swear
I solemnly swear
I solemnly swear
I solemnly swear
I'mma live by the code, I die by the code
I be a real nigga till my casket door close, huh?
