[Intro]
We here for the glow-up
(Everything foreign nigga)
Ladies and gentleman, hood nation has arrived
Bless up

[Hook]
Came with the posse
Chain looking ocky
Ice with the hockey
Playing in the mazzi
Playing with a bitch and her friend on the molly
Playing with the bands
Dope like i'm playing with the pan
Young god high in demand
Got a lot of shots in the can
Real niggas recognize real
You never been in that field
Yeen' bring nothing to the table
Yeen' gettin' none of my mills

[Verse 1]
I can't trust nobody
I don't love nobody
Nigga play around my people
Ima' have to tat that body (dou,dou,dou)
R.I.P lil' nigga
V.I.P with my niggas
Brand new pair of Margiela's
Smoking on a lot of godzilla
You should be ashamed of the boss
You should never claim you a boss
I never really minded the cost
I double backed up, from the loss
Me and OZ's gettin loaded
Headed to the hood on [?]
Pushing got the coupe wide open
Know I got the bridge wide open
Young nigga stuck to the code
Still in the cut with the Zoes
So much love when I'm home (Broward)
You already knowing what I'm on

[Hook]
Came with the posse
Chain looking ocky
Ice with the hockey
Playing in the Mazzi'
Playing with a bitch and her friend on the molly
Playing with the bands
Dope like I'm playing with the pan
Young god high in demand
Got a lot of shots in the can
Real niggas recognize real
You never been in that field
Yeen' bring nothing to the table
Yeen' gettin none of my mills

[Verse 2]
Vert' doing work on Collins
Peanut butter guts inside it
26 inch big body
I just got the fingernails polished
Hoe ass niggas can't ride with
Miss me with the lame ass logic
Pretty little bitch she a goddess
Booty on the bounce like 'draulics
Count that guap with the gang
Niggas selling out for the fame
Need a little hand sanitizer, I can't shake hands with a lame
So full of grace, keep the clean in your face
For the sake of the pesos
Man I got young bulls in the field, when the problem appears they arrive with the dracos
I been covered in the blood with the halo
I've been stepping on the scene looking fuego
I been losing more friends as the days go
Me and Queen getting lit like fable
I been doing my thing for a long long time
Hating there's a long long line
Rari nigga going world wide
You and your niggas look tired

[Hook]
Came with the posse
Chain looking ocky
Ice with the hockey
Playing in the Mazzi'
Playing with a bitch and her friend on the molly
Playing with the bands
Dope like I'm playing with the pan
Young god high in demand
Got a lot of shots in the can
Real niggas recognize real
You never been in that field
Yeen' bring nothing to the table
Yeen' gettin none of my mills
