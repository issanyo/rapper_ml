Ain't nobody do it wrong, they can't do it like me
Point your baddest bitch out, and bet let her fuck the team

Lamborghini doors up, see the now and later feet
Got the starbursts on my neck, jelly beans for the wrist
I'm a virus goin round, cause the jewels so sick
Take the smell of a nigga, bitch I know that I'm the shit
Who will start us in the game, on the summer jam list
Atlantic ATL, I'm on my New York shit
Got the single of the year, sucka niggas getting pissed
Spent a hundred for the chain, but I'm still up in the VIC
Homies say you getting money, flippin, servin them Buur

Pussy nigga where your money, bitch you lyin to the birds
Type a nigga go to court and tell the judge what he heard
He ain't hotter than me, and I'm sure you niggas heard
Got the streets on lock, they know the verses, every word
Every noun and every verb, bitch that's all a nigga serve

One question for you niggas, now tell em what it be
