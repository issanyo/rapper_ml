[Intro: Ace Hood]
Nation
Devil get off me. Devil get off me. Devil get off me Devil get off me. Devil get off me

[Hook: Ace Hood]
It took a minute the vision we finally got it together (aye)
I gotta be smarter I gotta go harder I gotta be better (aye)
I'm gettin' jealous, when I look in the mirror
I've been workin' on clearing, all the negative spirits
Devil get off me, devil get off me
We on them jet-skis, we was on South Beach
Devil get off me, devil get off me
I put them vvs in the cross I'm covered in blessings, ya

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Y'all go teaching again, niggas too eager to win
Niggas a sell they soul you give it right back they'll sell it again
Niggas don't plan for the end, everything gone in the wind
Doin' all this for the kids, doin' all this for the win
Gotta put food in the fridge, I can't lose in the end
I ain't gon thru it again, smoking on dope in the Benz
Boy back focused again. Boy back focused again
I wanna get loose in the rarai back to back to the party
So that I'm kinda gnarly dread locks rasta like I'm Marley
Call that bless on blessings, young nigga still manifested
Young nigga still progressing
Real nigga bossed up heavy, ayee

Devil get off me, devil get off me
We on them jet-skis, we was on South Beach
Devil get off me, devil get off me
I put them vvs in the cross I'm covered in blessings, ya

[Verse 2: Slim Diesel ]
I've been sick-n-tired each and every night keepin' open mind
I've been livin life, somebody pray for me, somebody pray for me
I was on the grind workin' doing over time tryna make a dime
I ain't scared to line ain't nobody wait for me ain't nobody wait for me
Most of y'all niggas be see thru ya same ones who died need you ya
Ima get it all when the rent due ya Ima go hard ain't taking no L
Back against the wall Ima do it myself
Pray to the lord when no one left... no one left... hmmmm no one left... no one left, look around the room ain't no one left aye
