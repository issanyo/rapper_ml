[Hook: Ace Hood & Rick Ross]
[A]I do it for the thugs and the motherfucking gangstas
[R]I do it for the strippers and the bitches put their hands up
[A]I do it for the haters that them never put their hands up
[R]I do it for the hustlers and this bitch throwin' their grands up
[A]Nigga, get money nigga, get money nigga, get money nigga, get money nigga

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
I'm like fresh outfit, blunts they lit
And a nigga out in bout who don't buck a shit
Yeah I gave you a classic in my debut
Cash flow for the hoes I bought (straight to)
You wanna ride you can't be actin' like Dre foo'
N.W.A. I bet you ace played you
Hollywood, Hollywood I see the big lights
And I'm with my big homie Ricky nigga yeah right

[Rick Ross]
Every minute that my heart pump blood
Fuck what you heard momma raised a fuckin' thug
Money on my mind imagine what's up in the trunk
And it get me 10 to life therefore I'm driving slow as fuck
On the road to riches feelin' like a billionaire (boss)
A got a couple mill a couple more an I'm really there
Haters talk around me fuck em like I really care
When we handle our business sorry they were never there

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Money ain't a thing I remain blinged up
Hundred on the chain bitch I think I'm King Tut
A nigga young and rich who feel like can't be touched
Forty stacks for the shades, so I can't see much
Unless you get the dollars still talkin' cash flow
Thousand dollar bill president Fidel Castro
Nigga with a attitude .50 and a mac-10
Ross cool as Ice Cube dicky and the black chef

[Ace Hood]
I'm in a heli-chopper starin' at the boat docks
Good weather good weather means more flux
Look in my eyes you can tell I'm seeing so clear
I get them bitches a prison an feeling no fear
More money means more Louis carry-on
When I touch your city you should see how hoes carry on
Bitch what's my name ace fuckin' hood ain't a damn thang change us

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Shit shit, and I'm a gettin' money ass nigga
Fast with the duffle bags with the cash in it
White squares that's equivalence of mo' dough
I hear my nigga Ricky selling on my promo
I make it rain ho better wear your poncho
To seek me on my TMO I get you mo' slow
The good life beats side of my condo
You know the name ask Jermaine on cut though

[Rick Ross]
Wooh, you talkin' funny would you fucking with the franchise
I decide how much you form the shit we let ride
I gave you niggas your first start up
Showed you how to dress made the hood be a part of
Maybe I should have kept my thought off
It's all good neither he'd hit the guard off
Now you shit nigga garbage you's a rat never build for this mob shit

[Hook]
