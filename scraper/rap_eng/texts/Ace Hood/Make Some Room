Holla!

[Hook]

Murder one, I kill the scene (Dhat)
My whip need to learn some manners cause this bitch is mean
And it's hard to choose cause them bitches love the team
Cash rules everything around me, nigga C.R.E.A.M

[Chorus]

Bitch who you looking at funny
You don't see all this money
You don't see all this diamonds
Ain't hard to tell it we run it
And I'm racked up, my racks up
I hit the mall and I rack up
On every single thing I want
Ay get yo cash up

Now make some room, I said make some room
Get out the way cause it's a lot of paper coming through
Make some room, yeah I said make some room
Get out the way cause it's a lot of paper coming through

[Verse 1: Iceberg]

Hey look, I twist up and get high
I get a grip, nut in that big truck
With that 2Pac of loud
My sticks up, niggas shot me
I ma clip up and slide
I ride around and get it
I spent 500 on my jeans
The whole 5 thousand in them nigga
Fuck whoever you with
My eyes bright and just got the grip
On the new chain for my jit
And got dogtags in that new thing
Cause I be in here with your bitch
And you hating while I'm snapping
Since you putting on a show
It's only right I go to clapping nigga
And the more you hate, the more I ball
Nigga I'm shitting on all y'all
And I know you falling off
Cause that money talks and you quiet
And I hate motherfuckers that park their wifes
When my last bitch had five

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]

Okay, I'm racked up and I rock that
Bitch see me, let me pass that
Fly as hell, that's YSL
My clientele got millionaires
Louie Vuitton, I got plenty of pairs
Flat black in that Pandamere
Getting head in that private leer
My diamonds clear in that Audemar
Bitch who you looking at funny
You don't see all this money
You don't see all this diamonds
It ain't hard to tell it we run it
God damn, give a nigga some room
Don't play cause a nigga know goons
Got sticks pussy nigga no brooms
Fuck once pussy nigga typhoon
I said I'm racked up
Swear to god if a lame nigga act up
Big fire, make a nigga wanna back up
I just hope that you really want backup
My and Iceberg stay stacking like a brinks truck
Live a life we don't really give two fucks
These hoes thirsty, come quench up
Bitch I'm 24 and I'm rich as fuck

[Chorus]

[Hook]
