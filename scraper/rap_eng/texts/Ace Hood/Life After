[Chorus]
Where was you when a nigga' needed you
Back when I was sippin' that apple juice
Way before the shit on my avenue
Back when Jordan's was like my favorite shoe
Where was you whenever I needed you
I got dreams, I promise to see 'em through
I got dollas', ain't got a point to prove
I got blessings, homie I never lose, I never lose
By golly, I gotta' glow up
I'I've been sippin', oh tryin' pour up
Get that money, then stack some more up
Told you Ace Hood will never fold up, fold up

[Verse 1]
You can't deny my love
Deny my passion
What you call fashion, I think right past it
My lifestyle lavish, my bitch ain't plastic
Stretch mark asses, is wildly attractive
I wanna know what you thought
I wanna know what it cost
For your soul, for them clothes, for that ride, and them hoes
But you know, to each his own
I'm smoking too strong
A nigga been raised on coupons
I done been lost a few times
Am I lying?
And I'm flyin'
Close-mind can't relate to my rhymes
I'm dismissing every inch of my pride
I'mma die for this, just look at my eyes
I got life and plus the fuel for my drive
I had to cut loose a few of my tires
Where the love at Teck?
And we flex
With all the struggles that we had to digest
Now they sayin' we next
Shit, we blessed
This is life after We The Best (ya)
(this is life after We The Best)

[Chorus]
Where was you when a nigga' needed you
Back when I was sippin' that apple juice
Way before the shit on my avenue
Back when Jordan's was like my favorite shoe
Where was you whenever I needed you
I got dreams, I promise to see 'em through
I got dollas, ain't got a point to prove
I got blessings, homie I never lose, I never lose
By golly, I gotta' glow up
I-I've been sippin', oh tryin' pour up
Get that money, then stack some more up
Told you Ace Hood will never fold up, fold up
