[Verse 1:]
I ain't really with the talkin'
I ain't with the flossin'
Man what's the word?
I can't call it Ace, where you been?
Bitch been ballin, smokin what you call it
Pockets lookin brolic
Diamonds on me polished
And smoking chronic
Yeah, bout it bout it boy
I've been in the dungeon
Ain't no easy does it
Like its Shaq in center
Ain't no easy buckets
This that couple million nigga fuck a budget
If you starving for it, know that sucker comin'
I've been up to something, yeah I'm up to something
In that mansion, laughing at you up and comings
Gotta a chick who pussy like the faucet running
I've been out in Europe getting foreign money
This the jump-back like I never left
Switch the flow cause they bite mine
Funny how them niggas analyze, funny how them niggas analyze
Fuck you niggas on that other side
All you pussy rappers out here tellin lies
I've been waiting patient niggas swear to god
Know the revolution will be televised

[Hook:]
And please understand that y'all niggas ain't scaring me
Let's get some motherfuckin' clarity
Diamonds in my watch, clarity

[Verse 2:]
I'm insane nigga, taking pain killers
Ain't know small talkin', got the chain bigger
Niggas claim triller but I know they not
You the type to go and testify
You the type to get your dog shot
You the type to be a mall cop
You the type to go pillow talkin' with the bitches put a nigga business out
I'm the type to goin see a body
Most y'all ain't never seen a body
Gimme gimme, semi so retarded wet the fuckin party
Who coast-guarded? I am so sorry to my loyal fans
Free shows for the live band, tell my CEO I'm goin back
Tell em' to issue me a new advance
Don't compare me to these other rappers with these same flows
And their songs whack. I am better breaded, I am Hercules
I am such a genius, and your tempurpedic
Nigga soft as ever, talking pigeon feathers
Know the storm coming, better check the weather
You will see me never, talking Stevie Wonder
They been sleeping mama, time to wake the monster
I am sick of playing, I am sick of talking
I been doing yoga just to keep me calmer
Countin hella money in my new recliner
Got my stripes in it like I'm Carson Palmer
If you hatin' on me nigga fuck your life
I Wish your mom and daddy woulda worn a condom
I'm in beast mode, I'm talking Marshawn, talkin Ronda Rousey, nigga Lebron James
In the studio, no shirt smokin loud dawg with some gold chians
Jay with me, G with me, P too, Hood Nation
Call ya bitch, whenever dog, 9 o'clock, reservation
Be patient, fans waiting
Fourth one, Starvation

[Hook:]
And please understand that y'all niggas ain't scaring me
Let's get some motherfuckin clarity
Diamonds in my watch, clarity

[Outro:]
Clarity, motherfucker
I'm talking 24 karat gold not that 18 shit
Ya Dig?
Clarity
I'm talkin' about stones so motherfuckin' then clear, clearer than blue ice nigga
Clarity
See these hoes back of that big Rolls nigga
These flows made of gold, pussy nigga
I'm taking 3D not HD, ya dig?
You gotta put your 3D glasses on for this nigga
Ayo Broward, we got this shit nigga
Let's make this shit clear
We gonna change the game with this shit nigga
S4 nigga let's get it
Hood Nation
