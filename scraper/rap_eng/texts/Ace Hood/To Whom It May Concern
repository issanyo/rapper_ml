[Intro]
Thank you for being here with me today
Appreciate you for coming
Trust The Process

[Chorus]
If I give you all of me, would I get all of you?
If I told you I'm anointed, could you see the proof?
Give my heart and soul for you when I'm inside the booth
Feel my love, feel my pain when I'm inside the booth
Would you switch or change on me if you knew the truth?
No, I ain't the same person that was introduced
Thank the Lord 'cause I don't look like what I been through
Here's a letter to you

[Verse 1]
I'm back again
Jesus on that cross, I had to rise again
Time to get my blessings, time to get my blessings
I had to live my life, I had to learn my lessons
I had to keep that smile but deep inside I'm stressing
Just tryna keep my spirits from that deep depression
It's time to tighten up
I put my pride down and pick that Bible up
Looking in the mirror tryna find myself
Queen, she know I love her till it life or death
Living on the edge plotting on the plans
Nothing without God, nothing without my fans
Sorry for my absence, hope y'all understand
No more We The Best, but Khaled still my man
Critics want the beef but I'm not feeding them
My loyalty don't stop if we don't speak again
I could cry tears right now
Don't know how I feel right now
All that meditation that I did, all that beasting in the gym
All this energy inside I got to give
Back and I'm better than y'all, ready whenever the call
They expecting me to fold, friends turn into ya' foes
Kept focus on the goals, mind, body and the soul
New me, it's a new day, that's another story untold
God, nigga

[Interlude]
At some point, we gotta talk about it

[Chorus]
If I give you all of me, would I get all of you?
If I told you I'm anointed, could you see the proof?
Give my heart and soul for you when I'm inside the booth
Feel my love, feel my pain when I'm inside the booth
Would you switch or change on me if you knew the truth?
No, I ain't the same person that was introduced
Thank the Lord 'cause I don't look like what I been through
Here's a letter to you

[Verse 2]
I'm back again
Feeling so immortal I must rise again
Put that on my mama, put that on my kids
R.I.P. Fo' Fifth, I tat that on my skin
You just be my angel till we meet again
I can hear you nod like "just keep going in"
I'm feeling the ether, I'm feeling Aretha
I keep it realer than people ain't no lies comin' out of the speakers
I gotta watch for the leechers, false prophets and the evil preachers
Come with normal features, I'm that different kind of a creature
I'm a fucking soldier, all my trials done made me stronger
Passion, I can't control it, hating, I can't condone it
Something just gotta give, don't listen, you gotta feel
Part of me had to die so one part of me gets to live
Walking out on the label I put aside all the fears
I'ma show all you niggas I do this shit here for real
On God

[Chorus]
If I give you all of me, would I get all of you?
If I told you I'm anointed, could you see the proof?
Give my heart and soul for you when I'm inside the booth
Feel my love, feel my pain when I'm inside the booth
Would you switch or change on me if you knew the truth?
No, I ain't the same person that was introduced
Thank the Lord 'cause I don't look like what I been through
