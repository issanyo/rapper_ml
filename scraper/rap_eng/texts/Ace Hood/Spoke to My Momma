[Intro]
Yeah, momma can finally smile
Pray for a better life
Just to see me through them tougher nights

[Verse 1]
Spoke to my momma just the other day
I told her "only God can make a way"
I'm hearin' tears, they runnin' down her face
Said she fed up with the struggle each and everyday
My step-pops, he be in the way
Too many bills my momma gotta pay
But know I got us, no doubt about it, on Granny's grave
They tell 'em 'bout us, my click ain't cowards, you sour made
And now they sweat me like Under Armours and Gatorade
I pray that one day you see me speak at the VMA's
And me and Khaled, we back to back in the latest things
Throw up the 'W', We the Best is the fuckin' gang
Hard work pays off, go n' get it, no days off
I know they all remember me, you recognize the name
I was that nigga bein' humble, counted out the game
Now I'm that nigga, still humble, carrying the flame
And everybody said I wouldn't take a walk of shame
Thought about you haters when I got my pinky ring
Living reality, it used to be a great dream
Hustle hard, everyday, get money, five ways
Same ol' shit, just a different day
Out here tryna get it, I'm out here gettin' paid
I'm out here gettin' paid
I'm out here gettin' paid

[Verse 2]
Young nigga, two seater
Tatted up, cruisin' in a wife beater
Bad bitch, top down
24's, see us skatin' on the whip now
I'm just livin' life, hope you do the same
Keep a bunch of real niggas so I never change
Look at me now, look at me then
Went from the Tourus, I'm thinkin' Benz
I'm makin' ends, now I'm thinkin' big
I got with Khaled, all a nigga do is win
See We the Best, nothin' less
It's war time, hope you niggas brought a vest
Got plenty women, came from that painted ceilin'
Fuck her on that Gucci linen, she'll cum in a minute
No love intended, I'm just tryna wet the willy
They freed my nigga Joc, he 'posed to do a life sentence
I'm from the bottom, came from the mud
Was given nothing, no love
Now I'm beast mode, no hugs
Back again, sho 'nuff
I'm the definition of blowin' up
Look at my niggas eyes, better know it's on us
You better know it's on us
Cause I got it sewn up
Cause I got it sewn up
