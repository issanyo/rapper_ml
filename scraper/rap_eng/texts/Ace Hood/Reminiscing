Yeah, let's rewind life for a second
Yeah

Let's take these niggas back to '98
Momma in the kitchen cookin' up her favourite cake
Daddy gone, never home, he said he outta state
Five times I only seen this nigga 'till this day
And I was blind as a youngin', but I learned better
Five kids, visitation came never
But I ain't trippin', mama did the dirty work
23, ain't got a crib that's seven figures worth
Even as a youngin' I had bigger dreams
Made another way instead of triple beams
17, all about that green cream
Work that 9 to 5, I put it in about a week
That's true story, it was overrated
Gave them crackers middle fingers, cause they underpaid me
Back on the block, not a single dollar
I told them I'm the highest nigga out of Broward
They laughed at me, they clowned me
That hatin' shit don't want that bitch around me
So I joined the label, dollars and deals
I stayed around the corner from minors who deal
Stackin' that money, switchin' them wheels
Motivated by the dough, boy, he gettin' chips
My vision changed, the struggle came
I see my momma crying, and I can feel the pain
The bills are so behind, we can't afford a thing
We can't afford a thing
Couple months I met with DJ Khaled then
Signed my deal and got a hundred thousand dollars, pimp
Called my momma cryin' like: We outta here
Hard times, kiss my ass
Flew to Louie pushed a thousand in a duffle bag
That was '07, fall back to 2012
Haters said I'll get one hit and very well
No sugar coating shit, you niggas fairytale
And free my niggas locked behind them prison cells
I'm on 'em, just a few, who send my niggas mail?
Hear a lot of talk, what would you niggas do?
I'm everywhere, you're never there, I'm like a prostitute
Brought my money, let that pistol bust your testicles
Speaking on my fam: You get the medic room
A couple top 10's, bitch I'm living good
Penthouse in Miami, only I could do it
Let them bitches suck 'till they catch the fluid
I just lost my daughter but I'm praying through it
Starvation, starvation
Different everyday, like I'm on vacation
Underrated, they say I is
And I'mma give 'em hell, know the Satan fears
Starvation, starvation
Like lookin' in the eyes of a poor baby
Poor baby, they scared now
Did it for you non-believer, in case you wonder why

Amen
Love
