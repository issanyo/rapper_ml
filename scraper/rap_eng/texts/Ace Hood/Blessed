[Intro]
You know...
I'm so grateful for everything
For every experience, for every roadblock
For every good person, for every bad person
Grateful
Trust the Process

[Chorus]
Everything 'bout a nigga' blessed
Everything 'bout a nigga' blessed
Everything ain't about a K
Everything ain't about a K
Know I got the squad on deck
And we gon' make a movie on the set
Pull up like I own that shit, yo' baby-mama's on my dick
(wait, wait, wait)

[Verse 1]
Lo-lovin' this zone that I'm in
I don't ever want this feeling to end (wait, wait, wait)
Par-parking lot pimpin' wit' ya' friends
You gon' probably get the pussy that way (wait, wait, wait)
I ain't hit the weed in a while, I'm surprised I've been feeling so great
Ridin' 'round rippin' in a Wraith, got that K. Lamar bumpin' in that bass
Blessed up, toes to the chest up
Queen, butt-naked, cookin' breakfast
I just wanna' ride her like a Lexus
Diamonds so retarded, rode the short bus (yes, lawd!)
Had to tell the jeweler to anoint us (yes, lawd!)
Stay prayed up, that's a message
Just to see tomorrow is a blessin'
Stay prayed up is the message

[Chorus]
Everything 'bout a nigga' blessed
Everything 'bout a nigga' blessed
Everything ain't about a K
Everything ain't about a K
Know I got the squad on deck
And we gon' make a movie on the set
Pull up like I own that shit, yo' baby-mama's on my dick
(wait, wait, wait)

[Verse 2]
Wake up in the morning to a new day (thank you Lord)
Gotta' thank the man up above me
I might fuck around and drop a mix-tape
I meditate and turn into a sensei
Pray everyday I get my life straight
Heart turn cold like a ice tray
Slidin' through the city like it's first base
Blessings to my homies caught a cold case
This for nigga's gettin' it on the low-low
Hustlin' so their family is straight though
I respect the game, nigga' bag up
Covered in them crosses from the bad luck
Smilin' for no reason, I got joy
Way too much finessin', too much poise
Miss my baby girl and my lil' boy
Every single time I hear their voice... (I'm like)

[Chorus]
Everything 'bout a nigga' blessed
Everything 'bout a nigga' blessed
Everything ain't about a K
Everything ain't about a K
Know I got the squad on deck
And we gon' make a movie on the set
Pull up like I own that shit, yo' baby-mama's on my dick
(wait, wait, wait)
