Ay, ever since I can remember, I’ve been ballin’ like a bitch
Private planes, champagne, bitches gettin’ switch
Ever since that money came, they been on the dick
Them fine supermodels always end up on my list

[Verse 1]
Wh-what is tenfold? Fuck when that pussy calls
I blow bout 20 bands a [?] just to piss ‘em off
Bitch I’m here to set it off, I’m here to set it off
You used to be the man homie, now you fallin’ off
You niggas buy the bar, I buy the club out
My condo on the beach, call it my clubhouse
L-M-A-O, what the fuck they hatin’ for?
Stay in some sneakers that don’t drop until the month’s over
Every time I ride, I keep my nine, I’m talkin’ Romo
Niggas runnin’ they mouth, I get to snappin’ like a photo
You fall in love with all these bitches, that’s a no no
You pillow talkin’ with these hoes, you’s a homo
Stick to the G-Code, I remain in beast mode
See me throwin’ money like I’m workin’ on my free throw
If I’m spendin’ money, she officially my freak hoe
And I keep them thangs, they go wherever that weed go

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Bitch I’m ballin’, ballin’, ballin’ like a bitch
Yeah I’m ballin’, ballin’, ballin’ like a bitch
Yeah I’m ballin’, ballin’, ballin’ like a bitch
We in this mothafucka, young niggas gettin’ rich

[Verse 2]
Okay, now hello there Americard, swagger will embarrass y’all
Catch me in Versace, it go well with my character
It’s in my genetics to be fly, y’all like amateurs
Ballin’ like a bitch, so disgustin’ how I’m pullin’ up
Ridin’ in that Phantom Ghost, yellow bone, camel toe
Jury on [?], call it Michelangelo
All black, shawty get to singin’ Barry Manilow
Fuckin’ right my money long, that’s a nigga antidote
Three cars, bigger crib, couple mil, I’m 24
Livin’ fast hemi flow, competition, send me more
Just to piss them haters off, I might go buy a fuckin’ boat
Money stock, I’m never low, cars, I imported those
Women got a lot of them, I switch ‘em like my underclothes
I just did a new deal and I got a new bitch
They stealin’ my old flows, but I’m on some new shit
Yeah, I’m on some new shit
