[Hook]
I know you ain't never met a nigga like me
And you prolly never will I put that on my OG
And I know none these other niggas seen the shit I seen
They don't hustle like I hustle get this shit by any means
And I know all them bitches with me do be hella bad
Hit the mall and blow a stash call it blowin money fast
I know they hate it,(i know) and they waiting for me to fall off that'll be never though

[Verse 1]
From the bottom to the top I came a long way
Used to sip on quarter juices now it's Rose
Now that marrow sittin whiter than some colgate
Baby momma trippin' she do shit the wrong way
Fuck it gave my lawyer 50 for the court case
What you know about making money at a fast pace
Yea I know them feds steady watching niggas
My youngns play with guns like some action figures
Bet I know how to make these money a triple flipper
Only breaking bread with the realest niggas
Wake up in the morning greet a bad bitch
Fuck her once and then im focused where the cash is
Lacing up my Guccis had to grab 10
I gotta stay safe bring the Mac 10
And I know they want me dead and gone
Paranoid I keep that pistol in my carry-on

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They told me when you getting money boy them niggas hate
Stacking paper 23 I'm thinking real estate
Ownership of what I'm driving we don't renovate
Get money my nigga stuck in real state
Call me by my government when I be at the bank
Talking figures nigga half a million Ben Franks
Heard them niggas kinda mad that's a bitch place
As long as my pistol on me I go to your bitch place
Think I really give a fuck about all you pussy niggas?
Counting paper screaming fuck all of you pussy niggas
I swear I'm balling to my last breath brand new prezie on me
Call that fucker sudden death
I tell my bitch to keep on sucking til there's nothing left
That's your girl? I just may commit a grand theft
And I know they want me dead and gone
Paranoid I keep that chopper in my carry-on
