[Bridge: Baby E]
Amen
I love all my hoes bad forever and ever
Amen
Hitting licks til I’m rich forever and ever
Amen
Got my legacy living forever and ever
Amen

[Verse 1: Cap 1]
I got some niggas with me that a send me big shouts
To the move and my bitches don’t play by them
Nigga you fuck up that check, it get ugly
We outchea, we thugging, we got to get money together
Break it down and split the profit
Then we started from the bottom
We moving that product, they want it, I got it
We did what we did just to get the out the project, 100
Shouts out for my legacy and my name nigga
My name ringing them bells Ringing them bells, hit on that thing switcha
We climbed out the mud, I got love for my brother
In the kitchen water whipping that butter
We back in the trap, got the street doing numbers
We hustle, our winters go crazy, December I’m gone

[Hook: Baby E]
I'ma have my dawgs with me forever and ever
Amen
I love all my hoes bad forever and ever
Amen
Hitting licks til I’m rich forever and ever
Amen
Got my legacy living forever and ever
Amen

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
I’ma still be a real nigga
Getting money like a motherfucker
Forever, forever
Ain't nobody ever loved us Reason why I keep guns on the tour guns
Smoke blunts for the homies in the Chain Gang
Tell my nigga Fat Boy to hold his head up
I’ma send a paycheck when he out
With a thick red bitch in a blouse
I love my niggas I don’t love these hoes cause she’s using her mouth
Yes, Lord
Amen amen
I’m type to tell my dawg get a gun up
Take a ride then I wipe away the plates

[Hook: Baby E]

[Outro: Baby E & Ace Hood]
Forever? Forever ever? Whatever
I love all my hoes
Getting money like a motherfucker
Forever and ever
Amen
Got my legacy living forever and ever
Amen
