[Ace Hood]
You see people for who and what they are, dawg
Like when you don't have much
Like, you know or you just trying to figure it out
You in the space of figuring it out
And quote, unquote, people immediately think that because this guy is successful, or this person is doing something so well, that they have it all together
I just believed in the idea and the fact that, I'mma not only pull through this, but I'mma pull through, I'mma pull through it stronger
Like we 'gon be stronger than we've ever been
And for me, the best is yet to come
You know me, whether I wear a watch or pull up in a nice car, I am, who I am, wholeheartedly
I-I think that at some point it just... it expired for me, "you know what I'm sayin'?"
And like, I'mma love dawg forever, like, 'cause you know that my nigga', what we've been able to accomplish is like... it's incredible
It's so powerful, just cause by being great fucking human beings
By being great people, making great decisions, making great music, and just being the best version of yourself that you can be
I'm healthy, I take care of myself
I'm the jewel, I'm the diamond
I'm telling you dawg, I'm a good nigga', I'm a...,you know what I mean?
Cause like, on a real level, shit, I got so much that I wanna do
'Cause everybody wanna always tell you, "but they did it this way", and I get it, that's one way of doing it, but you gotta' keep the table of possibilities open, because anything can happen, you know what I'm saying?
Like, people always ask me like, "yo, why you so shredded?", 'cause I'm like, I'm used to taking the stairs, I'm used to...I'm used to taking the stairs and building my way up, I'm used to coming from that place, and working my way up
