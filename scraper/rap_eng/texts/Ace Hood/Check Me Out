Oh, holly molly, rollin on me fuck your click, the homies
I get money, paper taller than that fool Ginobli
Just know my kardashian ain't talking Khloe
And these bitches all up on my dick, but I ain't talking moby
They say my swagger super dumb, but hey, I graduated
I got that shit, that will make your bitch, forget you penetrated

And the freaky shit you like i'll make her demonstrate it uh, Plus a nigga upon these boys illustrate it
Silly ass, niggers swag kill 'em like the chopper do
Turn 'em into milkshake serve 'em at the jumbo juice
All you niggers super sweet like candy at the carnival
Riding through my city not a judge but I'm your honor ho

See me fucking shoes? medium rare
Rear bottom, you can spot 'em like a cheetah nere
I'm a fly nigga, but you knew it though
A million dollar nigga, only twenty fours

Check me out, check me out
That new ferrari, let's test it out
Diamonds on my neck and wrist let's take a camera shot
Ok, let's crack this bitch, back up, better know my fucking name
A-C-E-H double O-D luggie and some fuckin brain
And that shit go where she think, that whip on me is major pain
Way too much of hatin you should be ashamed
Black camaro call that fucker V-Rames
Might throw it on 6's like LeBron James
Intercept your bitch, now that's the ball game!
Just keep on stealin flows I won't call names
But hey!

I know you're watching like I'm your tv
Now check me out
