[Intro: Jeremih]
I could have all the money in the world
But it wouldn’t mean nothin’, nothin’, nothin’
And I could have all the fame in the world
But it wouldn’t mean nothin’, nothin’, nothin’

[Hook One: Jeremih]
If you love somebody and nobody else matters
Say yeah (yeah, yeah) oh yeah (yeah)
If you love somebody and nobody else matters
Say yeah (yeah, yeah) oh yeah (yeah)

[Hook Two: Jeremih]
When I’m in the club (when I’m in the club), they be showin’ me lovin’ (they be showin’ me lovin’)
But it really don’t make a difference
If it ain’t my girl (if it ain’t my girl), then it don’t mean nothing (then it don’t mean nothing)
Cause without her I know something’s missing - yeah, yeah, yeah
When you know (yeah), when you know, when you know (yeah), when you know
When you know (yeah), you know you got somebody who loves you
When you know (yeah) when you know, when you know, when you know
Cause without her I know something’s missing - yeah, yeah, yeah

[Ace Hood]
That's right, haha, chea, chea, chea..
I’m addicted to money, I’m addicted to cream
I’m addicted to her, for that love I’m a fiend
Just imagine your touches, I can picture your rubbin’
But I smile when I see ya, girl I’m high of your lovin’
Live my life like a dream, every king needs a queen
Girl my life is a movie, sipping Goose in jacuzzi
Picture staring this movie, picture dripping in Luis
See us cruising on yachts, while we feasting on sushi
Used to mingle with groupies, they be begging to do me
But my mind on my misses, never mind all them women
Feel me tasting your kisses, and it’s you what I’m missing
Girl I’ll trade in this living, I just want you to listen

[Hook Two] + [Hook One]

[Interlude: Ace Hood] + (Jeremih)
Now if you love em’ and you know it and it ain’t that hard to show it
Put your hands up (yeah, yeah, yeah), put your hands up
Now if you with em’ through whatever, know that shit can’t do em’ better
Put your hands up (yeah, yeah, yeah), put your hands up, Ace

[Ace Hood]
Got the money and cars, biggest houses and yards
Had the baddest of broads, but I’ve trade in it all
Hang up my player card, present the ace of heart
You can keep the fame, the game, the name and all the fancy cars
You can have all them groupies, they be begging to do me
Put my mind on my misses, never mind all them women
Feel me tasting your kisses, and it’s you what I’m missing
Girl I’ll trade in this living, I just want you to listen

[Hook Two] + [Hook One]

[Ace Hood]
When I’m off up in the club, yes I’m missing your love
Girl I’m fiendin’ your drug, and I need that it’s a must
All these women I lust, begging me for my tough
Don’t amount up to much, but it’s nothing like one
You can have all them groupies, they be begging to do me
Put my mind on my misses, never mind all them women
Feel me tasting your kisses, and it’s you what I’m missing
Girl I’ll trade in this living, I just want you to listen
