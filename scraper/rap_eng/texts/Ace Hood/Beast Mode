[Verse 1]
Chain freon, you's a peon
I brought my corner back, yeah I'm Deon
Bad bitch on, Sanaa Lathan
Keep your faith on, just be patient
Black Yukon, distribution
I'm a genius, Jimmy Neutron
I'm a Hot Boy, y'all are lukewarm
Imma do me, fuck what they on
White G-wag, fresh sea bass
Clean G pass, livin' too fast
Money in bags, coming to get that
Fuck the chit-chat, I make an impact
Got it gift wrapped, merry christmas
Call it dispatch, this a big batch
We made a movie, they talking Meech back
Givenchy button up, I show the ten pack

[Verse 2]
Young icon, I'm a legend
Private villa, counting l'argent
Head honcho, Griselda Blanco
Foreign driver, Italiano
Fuck the rumors, get the mula
Catch a new vibe, trip to Dubai
It's for the weekend, go off the deep end
Butter pecan, she Puerto Rican ohh
Brother keep on, brother preach on
Rap phenom, I'm a Lebron, yes
Hella scary, necessary
Niggas sweet, February
I want the glory, mandatory
It's child's play, statutory
Beast mode, reload
God's son, cheat code
