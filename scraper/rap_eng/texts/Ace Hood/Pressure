[Intro]
I'm sorry
I'm a stand- up guy
Fuck y'all

[Verse 1]
See when you get the wave you can dictate
Giving niggas pressure on a mixtape
Play big bank take lil' bank
Boy been special like a 38
Slick talk never mind anyway
Ima come see you like the rent late
Get a nigga crushed on a Wednesday
Chevy do you dirty check the intake
Snapping on the beats like a photo
Looking for revenge if you don't know

[Hook]
(Tuyo, Tuyo será)
When you go the wave you can dictate
I don't give a fuck what a bitch say
(Tuyo será, Tuyo será)
Giving niggas pressure on a mixtape
Giving niggas pressure on a mixtape
(Tuyo, Tuyo será)
How are you? Juno
Been taking care of business on the low low
(Tuyo será, Tuyo será)

[Verse 2]
Praying that my dawg get his life right
I love getting head on the turnpike
Foot steady stepping on your windpipe
You can tell it's foreign by the headlights
I got a bad bitch, Puerto Rico
Compare it to the flow that's a kilo
How he get rich he a negro?
Kunta Kinte in a new whip
Cosmetic clips give your facelift
Hit G5 for the day shift
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
I been in the gym and got macho
Swerving on a hater like a pothole
You don't understand niggas [?]
I send my niggas through catch a Vato
Niggas want beef bring a milkshake
Better know you fucking with a Jefe

[Hook]
(Tuyo, Tuyo será)
When you go the wave you can dictate
I don't give a fuck what a bitch say
(Tuyo será, Tuyo será)
Giving niggas pressure on a mixtape
Giving niggas pressure on a mixtape
(Tuyo, Tuyo será)
How are you? Juno
Been taking care of business on the low low
(Tuyo será, Tuyo será)
