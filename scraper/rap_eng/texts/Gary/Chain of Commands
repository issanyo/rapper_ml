Intro:
Yea
Stay true to the chain
Now I'm icy as hell
Listen
Yea, uh uh uh uhh
Ah yea yea

Verse 1:
Look, a hold up hold up
What you talking about nigga
Just in case you ain't know
This the walk around nigga
D dot no space
Keep it tight with my hitters
Big dub enough height
Don't make me jump off this pillar
Heard you chirpping in the corner
I be paying attention
Hope you never bring it at me it'll cost for a mention
Uh
Yea
Flow colder than Gibson's
In the middle November already caught all the symptoms
And I don't think that you caught it
So let me say it much simpler
Blanco in the building
Better hide how you're feeling
No words get traded
Exchange somethings like I'm TILA
Throw some true in the Jay
They never knew I was Dilla
Beat em' down like Muhammad
All I need is a reason
And y'all ain't talking about nothing
Need to develop your thesis
All my women conceited
Your line up looking receded
She left you sitting on babies
While other niggas competing
Disrespect is mutual
And the kid too nasty
No cosign over that no tangent
Fell from the hill the east side where I landed
Woopty woop
Out the Honda's
Riding dirty
What's happening
In this match up
You lose to the life
Like it just hit five
You rolling down the five
Trying to make it through Fife
But my dogs no Fife
No bark all bite
Stash the case and the nines
They were ready to eat
Packed 'em into sixteens
Catch ya ass while you sleep
Check the chain of commands
For those words leave you cheap
No chances
Cold set in stone next to the ten commandments
Listen

Chorus x2:
Hold your own
Don't move alone
Keep it with you
Don't let it show
If they run up keep it simple
Don't be lying you'll get caught up in that action
If they ask you better let em know what's happening

Verse 2:
I stopped dreaming
The prophecies
Made it obvious
Moses in the middle
I rock the wave like it's Nautica
Tell em to swim good
Before we fry em up like tilapia
No more being easy
Too many niggas is flopping
And that shit won't slide with me though
Stay to the script Tarantino
No Corino
I only got love for my people
Outsiders ain't faithful
Trust always been lethal
Concreted the key
Hoe keep your game on lock
Uh
Weave like a needle
The moves just won't stop
Young bucks get dropped
Same team never swapped
I keep that shit on G
Units stay on top that's guaranteed
Follow up and prevail
No way it can fail
Impala whip like Chevelle
Never leaving a trail
Duracells for the scale
Stay true to the chain
Now I'm icy as hell
Gotta

Chorus x2:
Hold your own
Don't move alone
Keep it with you
Can't let it show
If they run up keep it simple
Don't be lying you'll get caught up in that action
If they ask just let em know what's happening like

Outro:
Yea
If they run up
Just let em know what's happening
Yea
Just let em know what's happening
Stay true to the chain
Now I'm icy as hell
