[Intro: Jay J]

You gotta go hard today, cuz' you might not see tomorrow.../
Bitch nigga/

[Hook: Jay J]

I might not see tomorrow/
I might not see tomorrow/
Might not see tomorrow/
So I go hard today/

I might not see tomorrow/
I might not see tomorrow/
Might not see tomorrow/
So I go hard today/
Aye/

[Verse: Jay J]

Rock star life, similar to the Beatles/
I will smile up in ya' face, but my intentions are evil/
I just might rob the bank and give it all to my people/
If I do it once bitch, then you know it's a sequel/

Give me one chance and I'm retreating to Rio/
It's a very thin line between good and illegal/
Sometimes violence is the way to keep it peaceful/
A nigga go hard like a nigga shot up pre-school/

I'm against violence but I'm not when I need to/
Snuff a nigga in his fucking mouth, we ain't equal/
Praying to myself because they say God can guide you/
I'm the last mother fucker that you should be lying to/

Chillin' like a villian, I won't hesitate to lie to you/
There's a long line of niggas jumping to their death, after you/
This the beginning of the end/
And I hope you lil pussy niggas ain't scared/

[Bridge: Jay J]

La La La, La La La La

[Hook: Jay J]

I might not see tomorrow/
I might not see tomorrow/
Might not see tomorrow/
So I go hard today/

I might not see tomorrow/
I might not see tomorrow/
Might not see tomorrow/
So I go hard today/
Aye/

[Outro: Jay J]

I might not see tomorrow/
If a nigga died tomorrow/
What would you say?/

Would you pour out some liquor for me?/
Would you pour out some liquor for me?/
Tell em' pour out some liquor for me/
Tell em' pour out the lean for me.../
