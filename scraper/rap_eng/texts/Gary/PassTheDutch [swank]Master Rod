Intro:
Said these the sounds of the sound
Whussup?
Yea,yea, yea

Verse 1:
Who's this calling my phone
At eight in the mornin'
Trying to get on
With more trees to blow
Throw my pants on
I chase a dollar and a dream
Look at me confused
Is you a scholar or a fiend?
Fuck, that white talk and that black talk
This how we all talk
Slang gets pushed out
Then come back like boomerangs
Or bad karma come to haunt you
This is doctor Frankenstein monster
Meets ganja with a style so proper
I kill rappers
These are just the Lego blocks to my life
I swear to you, I could build rappers
I take a hit
Review my competition
They facing constipation
They ain't drop shit

Chorus x2:
All I wanna do is toke with my bros
Provoke some hoes
And find out where the money stack
Broke niggas still broke
Hoes gon' keep hoeing
Bro, we only care about where the money stay

Verse 2:
We only care about where the money stay
We only care about where the money stay
We only care about where the money stay
More money
More problems coming every other day
No money
Even more problems going the other way
I see they sleep
I treat these dreams like a runaway
Chase it, till my feet give in I'm gon' forever race
Spit my sweet sixteen and celebrate it with the cake
No sugar coats
I need the frosting on vanilla plates
Can't stay the same
My only problem is to elevate
And that's the end
