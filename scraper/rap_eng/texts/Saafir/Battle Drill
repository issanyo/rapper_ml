[Intro]
I'm a king pin you can't win (3x)

[Verse 1]
Boxcar sessionist black magic is the magnet
Breakin' 'em down to micro fragments
I might go dragnet
Shoot Joe on Friday
If I miss I'll get your one day
Won't forget officer Monday
I'm good with gun play I get wreck check the boss
Don't remove your firing pin, punk, cause I get off...
Comes the safety
Freak a clip or get plugged with the four - 5th
Off my niggas hip best believe the triggers gettin' gripped
We stroll the back doors to the railroad
Is where we go when we flow
Hell knows and elbows are shot
Thrown don't blink an eye get
Ruff when I flex the Ingrim chrome don't even try it
I'm the arsonist cause I'll burn you with the slug I'm...
Funky plus I got carpet fresh in my rug
Tug a war and get dug
Six feet under
Floor plans are banned
Combat hand to hand
Cowards clocks is gettin' cleaned with detergent
If you want to freak a funky flow we can splurge it
So I'll perk like an expert I'll...
Send a flow that'll kill
But I won't break a sweat in a
Battle drill

[Verse 2]
Start ya engines
But you look exhausted like carbon...
Monoxide. I'm sly like a foxeye...
See me?
I'll jack you for your bundle G
I'll be lurking in the rear smirking when you're crumbling
The hobo junctionist...
Function is...
To freak the lyrical
Smoke a blunt to the grill
Till we reach the spiritual world
Then get wit ya girl dip her like a tea bag
Up it another notch for the flea bag
King queens be freaky fiends don't sleep, or fall off
Think the cocks the bomb but like Tom you'll get brokawf
Sheer energy so u know I be stockin' rear entities
Eatin' linto beans and I do reek
When I speak... true who's this ya girl?
Nice to freak you
Let me freak a clip slip one in the chamber
Click clak that's the sound of the gat
Right before the jack comes true I thought you knew
That's the cue oh! But you're a hero
Muscles kinda swollen but you ain't
Real you wouldn't strike if we was bowlin'
To the left march arch ya back
The impact is fat when I tag a grill
For a battle drill

[Verse 3]
The funky nomadic attic dweller never
On the cheddar cheese
Grease down the plank yankin' mentals
Clean slates are freaked treats for the tricks like
A magician doin' halftucks genies
And Arabian's chest be cavin' in
And I be in the rubbish
Rubbin' this like Aladdin
Through obstacles my saliva be
Liva than stoppin' foes in they tracks
Cuttin' the tape it's nutthin' to debate
Fate tells me this is the last grape to be cracked
Rippin' the plaque between the gums
Hums this lift ya lip a little more to the chef's recipe
For flavor they be beggin' me to stop
The torturing but forth I bring a subconscious
Which means no consciousness
On this effort
No mercy on a groove
No space to move
Check mate
It's reserved for the disinfecting
I'm projecting flavor till you choke, chalk one
Add a kill
For battle drill
