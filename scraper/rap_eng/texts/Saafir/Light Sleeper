[Intro: DJ scratching]
Ah, here we go

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I know I'm an emotionally disturbed person
People think I'm talkin' to myself when I'm rehearsin' on the rhyme
A mass productionist
A mass production matador, pan it more to the left, there you go
Minimize the synthe-sizer wiser when I wind up for the pitch
But I don't pitch a bitch
Cause sales get derailed and towed
He owed an abundance of cash
Damn, I let it go
He was my man
I tried to trust him, but I busted him
Twice, in my trash can and I'm askin'
I don't need psychology to see
The dichotomy in me
Knew something was fishy
But I'm better than wishy washy or topsy turvy
It kinda irked me that I caught him sleepin'
Cause I try to be wide awake
But he slows it down
So I can't dilate and show that I'm bigger than that
But I also have to consider the fact that opposed to him
Not being the right peeper, I'm a light sleeper

[Hook]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
But I'm a light sleeper, I'm a light sleeper
Wake up, don't sleep
But I'm a light sleeper, I'm a light sleeper
Wake up, wake up
But I'm a light sleeper, I'm a light sleeper
Wake up, wake up
I'm a light sleeper, I'm a light sleeper

[Verse 2]
So what do it mean when I reach maturity
And still see that I'm not the mayor of my mayonnaise
The master of my milieu
At least I have a swing and a few things on my mind
It's never a good nighty night
Just a rise 'n' shine
Why's the rhyme so important?
Why do I have to be so potent and blow the microphone without chokin'?
I don't
I'm arrogant and outspoken
Mouth no token I'm just a roust about
I have a house and clout but I don't come tight
But it's routine since few fiend for true hip hop
It's a trip when I drop my style
And forget it and forget where I got it from
And how I got 'em sprung, cause I'm
Stuck on myself and I depend on my luck and wealth for health matters
So I don't explode with stress
I'll serve you an elf platter
They'll tell me that my shit is fatter than the first
But I'm a light sleepin' rapper in a hearse

[Hook with variations]

[Verse 3]
I don't wear sarongs in my songs
I diss the skirts in verses
And I used to measure my demeters with clever pentameters
But I bounced like a pogo and I'm solo with the hobos
A nocturnal colonel in a journal
I put fly kids' eyelids to rest a detour
For deep sleep when I freak beats
I snap like a defective contraceptive and my sleep
Will be light, so you'll know that I'm tight

[Hook with variations]
