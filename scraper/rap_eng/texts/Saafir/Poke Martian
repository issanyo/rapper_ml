Song: Poke Martian

My septic's anti on the skeptical
Who jocks
And disavow ya actions
Who's your agent
2nd letter cause you're actin' like
A charlatan not
Let's say your freudian slips
On transmissions kicked daily
Don't let perpetual lies be the reason
Why
Treason play the seasonin'
On the pessimism in your thoughts
Meager is you game - hand, no
Trumps
As teep mentat poke martian
Caught 'cha frontin'
I peeped ya from da jump
I take it for true that plagarism
Captivates, your vision is blurred
Your head's swollen, crab
You irritate my scrotum
I recognize the pattern of your ways
Your swaze
Portrayed on the relay, some say
Another one of you is born every day
No, better yet, I'm not one to even take it that far
Yo! Where's that fuckin' bluestar...
