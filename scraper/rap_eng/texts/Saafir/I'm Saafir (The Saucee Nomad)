Album: Trigonometry
Song: I'm Saafir (The Saucee Nomad)

I'm Saafir, the Saucee Nomad (repeat 5X)
All day, all day, ery day, always
I'm Saafir, the Saucee Nomad (repeat 2X)

Out the side of the beat I slides out the gate like Snake Pliskin
With, heat fuming got more sauce than, Paul Newman
I'm the shit I'll make you bowel, movement
Runnin through em without the celery
Never embraced when thinkin cleverly is a felony
Hey hey, hey-hey hey, I got an A A-A in mixing elixirs
Remedies putting you under the laughing gas, like a dentist
If you seek I got prescriptions that work in three minutes
And some change, here's your receipt, here's your re-ce-ee-hee-pt
I keep saying that al-lee-hee, couldn't help me from these
Em-cee-ee-hees, that keep saying wack rhizymes to enzymes
I regurgitate and reverse your fallopian tube growth, rate
You so fake you belong with a strong ass-whooping
I got your ass cooking, ho ho ho like turkey beefy bacon
Is what you're feelin, just a professional opinion from the doc-torrr
You don't believe me then, let's take tests test me
Please do so so I can have ya, full Stranded at Sea like Caruso
Have you lookin over The Aftermath like Dr. Dre
Me make a mill-ion, lambingas they say

I'm Saafir, the Saucee Nomad (repeat 4X)
Ery day, all day, all day, always
I'm Saafir, the Saucee Nomad (repeat 4X)

I'm the type of ninja that'll laugh, then blast your ass
Then pass the bomb that'll fuck with my concious a little but I'll stay calm
In it, armed, I'm all about self-preservation in a fighting stance
Always ready to get down then run up in your ass like ants
But I'd rather pull plants by the root and get, smoked
With my crew makin greenery, and scenery the vision of a landscape is
With a handful of papers, get the papers
With the President faces on the front, with the eagle grabbin arrows
And the pyramid, and the owl that shrunk, huh dollar bill y'all
It's amazing how you keep paper grazing my palms and I make it stick
Like a magnet like a magnum never stagnant when I'm stickin it
Movin keep my motion, all blurred most likely, a visuallusion
I have you on the search for attachment, but not to focus
Have you won a contest as a finalist, on whose the brokest?
Flows stay saturated and drenched, I've never had to soak it
I'm the wrong breed to fuck with, I'm mixed with Grinch and locust
Hocus motherfuckin pocus, say what?

I'm Saafir, the Saucee Nomad (repeat 4X)
I'm Saafir everyday all day always

Psssssh, nigga please while you countin sheep it's Z's
I be countin cheese curin that, wack rap disease
Me and Doctor Dot Blocker on the off switch leavin
Your highbeams frost-bit, with overdose
Homo songs don't swing on the long, microphones
And if you're rich I'll send that doc-torrr to your mansion
While I'm, rock shit like avalanches
Makin your broad do dirty dances
You takin chances with them sleepin pills
Cause that's what got your conciousness
That's why I'm droppin this, don't sleep...

I'm Saafir, the Saucee Nomad (repeat 5X)
I'm Saafir, all day ery day, always
I'm Saafir, the Saucee Nomad

In here... (I'm Saafir) ...with the Porch Monkeys
(I'm Saafir) Bananas, Knuckles (I'm Saafir)
Bringin it to you (I'm Saafir)
One love to Mr. No No, for lettin me come on this track
And rip it for my poleops, that's it, hip-hop junkies and Porch Monkeys
