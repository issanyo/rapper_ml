[Verse 1]
Bored
Bored in my house, it's time for me to hit the streets
And find me a freak without a bra under (her blouse, mayne)
It's over, straight, through, finished
'Hey, you look like that nigga that played in Menace'
That's me but I'm not celebrity stricken
They be choosin'
Figuring I must be oozing with that bubbling dough
They be sayin' 'Oh, he look right plus his flow sound tight
I don't know what he be talkin' about but it makes me upset And at the same time it kinda makes me wet
The game in the rhyme tells me that he's a vet
It also tells me to get Met, girl, it pays'
But she doesn't know I'll molest her days like sunrays
Don't play me ride, bob your head to this richer
Ride to my shit, baby
Remove ya hands from ya drawers
No diggin' in designated areas
It'll make me think ya itchin' for a bitchin'
Causin' me to holler obscenities
They be dissin' me, these
Swingers, dig in they ass
Then turn around and smell they fingers
I caught one, no bullshit, no joke
That's why I had to stop hittin' indo smoke
'Cause I be flashin' on these hoes
The type of shit I see on summer days make me write
But I never bite
When I be riden'

[Verse 2]
Hoo riden' wit my folks Jay-Z is crazy
Straight soldiers in this shit
To leave his side, you couldn't pay me
We be clownin' but won't get caught slippin' and slidin' Slouchy in the afterlife talkin' like 'They got me Damn!'
I don't wanna die so I ride wit my patna' One Eye
One guy always be at me at the light
Hollerin' 'Ay, brah, I'll make ya windows tight'
Faulty is what he be on that squeegee
See, I be seeing streaks and shit
Get the fuck away from my car
I ain't got no money but I'm lying
He smiled at me then winked and flash me his diamond
I smobbed out the lot, hit the corner and peeped him on a plot
I watched a nigga get got
Then around the corner he came
Took off the wig and gave me the game
The same sentiment came from his intent
But it's irrelevant 'cause game recognize game
I'm intelligent, so save it
Up and out, burnt rubber on the pavement
The type of shit I see on summer days makes me write
But I never bite
When I be riden'
