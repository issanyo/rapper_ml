Stretching our earlobes over to the West Coast, this month takes us to the San Francisco Bay Area. Boasting one of the most booming underground hip-hop scenes in the country, the Bay Area is far too often slept on by other regions. Artists like Ice Cube's cousin, Del tha Funke Homosapien, have helped Frisco start to earn respect in New York, but what many kids don't know yet is that there's more where that came from.

     Hailing directly from Oakland, Saafir The Saucee Nomad rolls strapped with solid beats and fortified lyrics for any region he might stumble upon. Saafir strikes a fine balance in his delivery between a Too Short pimp sound and a more friendly Del appeal with that Hieroglyphic lyrical lean. Produced on an in-house 4-track by The Seven, the tracks blend East Coast jazz flavor with that thick West Coast funk.

     After an ill violin intro, Saafir sets it off with "It's A Pimp Thang," flippin' lyrics like: "Go to hell cause I don't play/ You say you're dope but on a scale you don't even weigh/ Talkin' about a motherfuckin' shotgun/ But when it comes to hearts, niggas ain't got none." The next jam "Mark" is ‘ole slow funky Biz type shit. A ‘mark’ is what they call a sucker out west. The last jam, "Prime Time After Seven," freaks some crazy jazz pianos with a sample of CL Smooth's "Ready or not prime time after seven" from "Mecca And The Soul Brother" as a hook.

     Let's hope the Saucee Nomad finds his way to record deal.
