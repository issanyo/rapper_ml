Song: Joint Custody

I'm accurate secure my spot there be no hot
Seats don't trick sweet treats even if I'm
Stiffer than a swisher easy going when I'm sleep warlike
It's when i attack untight mike masses
Don't conceal ya feel breed if you're exceeded
By who is this myself i demean so my dream
Of being a hiphop master won't shatter
Like plaster sample savior sup shallow taste
It peculiar rare, file no aroma of a coma substance
Is vicious vile wicked you can't fuck with the twisted
Winding sizeable you've stumbled into hazy ill-defined
Room ya shrumed ya self butt naked ya nothin but
Chosen prunes frozen fumes
Saafir will be here like landscape
I'll scrape ya ass off the reel
You've been edited I'm enriched fit
Full blown 11x13 it seems at first word
Seeing is no believing unless your vision is blurred
From these cutesy, cutesy new boodies on rap I'm rilin
Up a muthy gats being pushed in ya Saliva
Opening the file of a masterpiece
Is where i lease my space
I rope dope styles like cows ram them in your ass
Baby, oh! and this time i didn't forget the gravy
Pay me my respect check one hobo immovable spirit
I was brought here solely for the lyrics
I have no time for your unsubliminal earthly
I'll be lurkin on the b-side slidin in sideways
On the edge straight servin them I'm on some reap bitch
Shit shut up fall silent no perfume
I'll stay funky musty with this custody

I've mastered my adrenalin sendin souls to afterlife
Like Mussolini I'm like Houdini who can see me
I'm the same color of the sun if you have no pigment
You'll get burned charred to a crisp
Refreshing drink i think you need a sip of this
Cause you're this close to a lip of the wrist
And the thing you value the most
Life please let there be another entity
To devour proficient effective
When i think you should offer your feces
I'm going to revel and defile in the prostitution
Of the potency words swarmin teamin up
Pain will be equivalent to the unteethin of a pup
The force tell you don't prolong yaself
Ya too noticeable to the graduated continuing
It's amazing how your reproductive system works
Of art develop blossom gain grow
I see the unholy gain green in ya
Seems magnify move up i prefer ya
Raise ya cup why don't ya raise ya skirt
Well I'm pleased to see that you don't have the
Correct knees for the job off my nob by far
Sighted only in infrared ya not prepared to spar
With a heavyweight, dwelling repelling freshmens
Propelling them back to the guf look it up I'm puffy
Like my man from uptown for those weak
Don't provoke or speak or it spells an abrupt downtown
Trip, from the hips what's that smell of ass
We've past that point i have custody joint
