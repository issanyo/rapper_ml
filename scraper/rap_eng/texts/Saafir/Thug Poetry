(Intro)
Yeah nigga
Game from the mind of some real motherfuckin' thugs (thugs)
Fetty Chico up in this biAAtch (biaatch)
Bloow !! (blooow)

(Chorus) 2x
You wouldn't believe all the shit I see
(just a thug yes I'm only a thug)
That's why I spit this thug poetry
(walks like a thug talks like a thug)

Clown like a thug put it down like a thug

(Spice 1)
Release me to the belly of the beast
The jungle made of concrete
Real niggas die in they sleep
The strong prey on the weak
We gets down from dusk til dawn
Like quentin tarantino shakin' niggas up
In the neck like (Joe) Pesci in "Casino"
Fetty chico bailin' in buckets with bullet holes
Caught up in drug wars
Use current from cargos
Too much drama in my past time (past time)
I swore when I got outta jail it was my last time (last time)
Fuck One-Time (hahahaha)
Pants saggin' twisted up with the braids
Leave the house 3 in the mornin 'fore the Drug Unit raid
Get out the cemetery visit my soldiers up in the grave
Tell 'em I miss the times when we used to get paid
Though I'm thugging without ya
Nigga I ain't forgot about ya
Daily weapin' on some mobstyle shit ??
And when survival is goin' around
Called the "thug disease"
Gettin' niggas like rats trapped in murder for cheese
It's thug poetry

(chorus) 2x
I'm just a thug (thug) yes I'm only a thug (thug)
Walks like a thug (thug) talks like a thug (thug)
You wouldn't believe all the drama I see
That's why I spit the Thug poetry (spit the thug poetry)

(Saafir)
Ay, wassup
This is Saafir, mayn, check this out
I'mma tell you like this here, mayn
These Thug niggas, mayn
Look, let me lace you with like Thug Poetry
But now, I'm a rider though
So I'mma keep it mackish just lead me to it
Cause it's easy to do it but it gotta be fluent
Ohh shit this is bangin
Hangin' niggas with the microphone cord
That's my job without a rope (NO)
Without a motherfuckin' joke (don't laugh)
Nigga I'm clean as fuck without soap
Keep my poetry like 'get out ho' (get out ho)
Bustin' like a .44, Mr. motherfuckin' No-No from that Hobo
Junction is the westbound campaign
When I'm away from the camp, mayn
Rollin' solo but stay loaded with slugs
Cause ain't no love ho don't wear no diamond-studded glove
That superstar shit we'll get your ass put underground
Super-far trick (quick)
Like you fake ass niggas on some superhard shit
But never murdered
I'm a player that get braided up from the pussy
And never squirted (never)
That's game I hope you heard it
Cause I'm on a mad point nigga
Spice *WEEZY* serve it with some Thug poetry

(Chorus) 2x
I'm just a thug (thug) yes I'm only a thug (thug)
Walks like a thug (thug) talks like a thug (thug)
You wouldn't believe all the drama I see
That's why I spit the Thug poetry (spit the Thug poetry)

(Spice 1)
I smash on niggas pullin' triggers
We leave 'em stressed
Never leavin' home without the medal plate in my vest
This is westside livin' (livin')
Hangin' out with the unforgiven
Different murders under they belt but ain't nobody here trippin'
We're all felons in this motherfucker
Dodgin' 3 strikes (strikes)
Niggas smokin' on that chronic weed leaf northern lights
Reminisce of the dead (dead)
Pourin' out a little liquor (liquor)
Got me drunk and passed out
With my fingers still on the trigger (trigger)
Havin' nightmares of killers tryin' to take off my dome (dome)
Wake up shookin' at bad dreams, is my sanity gone (gone)
I'm looking for a piece of my mind there was torn
When my homie stopped breathin' and died up in my arms
Thug poetry

(Chorus)
I'm a thug yes I'm only a thug
Walks like a thug talks like a thug
I'm just a thug yes I'm only a thug
Bust like a thug cuss like a thug
Just a thug yes I'm only a thug
Smoke like a thug chokes like a thug
I'm just a thug yes I'm only a thug
Ride like a thug slide like a thug
Just a thug yes I'm only a thug
Blast like a thug smash like a thug
Just a thug yes I'm only a thug
Drink like a thug fuck like a thug
