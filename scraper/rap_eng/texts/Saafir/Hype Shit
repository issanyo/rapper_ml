Song: Hype Shit

You like classics well I'll stock that ass
Wit a 454 hypo, nitro hooked through the trunk
I'm a flowmaster monk you'll get smobbed on
I'll smoke that ass like skunk. You better
Rotate them drums locate that hum
No alignment
My rhymes remind me of ya suspension
Off to the left section off the strip
Let's strike a got a 7-deuce mali with sauce
Brandy wine gloss, releighs edelbrock manifold
Header chrome kit, aluminum tips and I'm
Assumin he'll slip and want to race me
For some scratch. I'll hook em in and pretend
My shit ain't tight. Let him bite then suck his ass
At the light - red light, smash - green light
I lit up a lotta stares, now he wanna fight
Nigga swing ya shit, I gets up outta there
Just me & him on the B & M shift kit from a rich b-
You wanna ride, unlock the shicks on tha cock
I'm smockin engine blocks overheatin oil level
Rebels cause I'm rollin in hype shit
I'm in some hype shit
I'm in some motherfucking hype shit

High speed chase down 280, I'm
Lookin at my oil gauge &
It read "you can't fade me." I'm floatin
Through traffic
Laughin 'n' shit but I wasn't trippin cause I had a gat
Wit a clip under the seat, then I heard the loud speaker
Speak, "pull your ass over on the offramp &
Don't try to vamp." Heart was on thumpa
The mark was on my bumper plus I had a zip
Of bomb on my lap, I couldn't dump the gat
Going into custody can't fuck with that, plus
I got a 396 with a trick in my trunk & I'm not
Goin out like a punk so I bounced - fuck it
The way he was in me you would think his slary poppin
But I got mallory hook up & I'm not stoppin for shit
I'm smobbin through tricks & trucks
5.0's gettin
Sucked and I'm caught up in the rear-view
Didn't see Linda Woo tryin to merge lanes
She almost hit me. (you biatch!) Took the Richmond turn off
Hit the switch on the nitro in a lean
I felt my shit was Christine
I'm out like a motha fuckin fiend, in hype shit
