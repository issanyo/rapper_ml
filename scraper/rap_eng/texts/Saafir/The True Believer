(Saafir)
I’m tryin’ to look past what I can see in front of me
The only way to be a true believer
To let go of the things that bling
And grow some wings
Get on that team of true believers
They don’t believe lies they see in the movies
And think they come back like Brandon Lee do
If you live your life evil
Then die he’ll lead you
To the gates where they take disbelievers

A slot for the righteous
Not a poodle
A pit
The knife just hit you
Split your throat
Slowly vicked you
Ain’t no rules in this
It’s lawless
So I try to perfect the faith until it’s flawless
Takes a lifetime to haul these bricks
I’m applauseless
This is not for show
For those in the know
Sins are atoned
But only with
Purification of your intention on this microphone
For the rest of his life it’s on
He know
Ain’t no goin’ back
Ain’t no flowin’ about no crack or kilos
If he’s attacked
Dump
Reload
Against the grain
There he goes
This is not a game for fame
He’s not a hero
Don’t spit flame
He spits C-4
Connected to your front door
Until you knock it
Fifty-yard kick through the goalpost
You can’t block it
It’s over you
The executive producer of the topic props is overdue
And it’s true

I’m tryin’ to look past what I can see in front of me
The only way to be a true believer
To let go of the things that bling
And grow some wings
Get on that team of true believers
They don’t believe lies they see in the movies
And think they come back like Brandon Lee do
If you live your life evil
Then die he’ll lead you
To the gates where they take disbelievers

The twenty-twenty vision
Not a beginner
The outer
The inner
The mouth of a spitter
Convicted doubts of a sinner
Without judgin’ the route is dimmer
And shrouded in glimmer
I’ll never fight for don king
Knock out his contenders
Bout is predicted
Can vouch for this menace
Will balance
No blouse or no spinach
Gowns down from the line of scrimmage
He’s relentless
Nine to five it’s a job not adventures
Crab shack crackin’
Grabbin
And pichin’
Wake your game up
These dudes is dreamin’
Gangsta leanin’
Into the fire
They priors is apparent liars
Esquires
With seventy-three thousand degrees
Under they knees
If you can feel me
Let’s kneel
Peel back the fiber of a rider
My intention is to addict ’em
And invite ’em
Ignite ’em on a mission to get it
Obtain it
Campaign it
Loud and clear
Bumper stick it
And his thumpers wit’ ’im
Please believe

I’m tryin’ to look past what I can see in front of me
The only way to be a true believer
To let go of the things that bling
And grow some wings
Get on that team of true believers
They don’t believe lies they see in the movies
And think they come back like Brandon Lee do
If you live your life evil
Then die he’ll lead you
To the gates where they take disbelievers

They doubt the route
The road not to be saved
But to pave a path
To avoid the wrath
On the last day
The race to hell
They runnin’ it
The punishment
Of the grave
Is the first wave of torment
As soon as your body’s cold
Your dormant soul grows past your collarbone
Ain’t no comin’ back with them crows
You gotta go
Home and your
Zone is known
Before you go
If you die a disbeliever
You goin’ to hell fa sho’
And the window to that is open while you in the grave
To show you your place in the flame
For what it’s worth
I’m tryin’ to keep my feet off that astroturf
It’s not a game
I believe in the last prophet that came
My uniform is torn
I’m not perfect
I’m passin’ the line to the mind
Like mine that’s dyin’ before their time
It’s curtains
You better watch the show
Whether you believe it or not
We all gon’ know
