See, it's the slickness of liquid
Keep a chick chirpin out my peripheral in all her trickness
Have no idea of the caliber of sick shit
Bed she's invitin, but she has a fear, I can sense it
Beyond your ???? breathin, lyin-ass heathen, I betcha
You could do it by yourself without me havin to wetcha
Let you in if you spin with me right
All the time so I can stay tight on the grind
That's my forte but won't flaunt it
Though you probably wouldn't never know
I'm a plumber, ho
One you haven't seen ??? scream hop like summer hope
That's heat collidin with game that's deep so I'll keep
Divin but all that really defeats the purpose of
Why I'm really hollerin at you as a straight hustler
Which is the mindstate of these witches
That be gettin other niggas blind-mind raped by other bitches
See, some ain't knownin they be workin as a team
When they be workin on a nigga with major cream
These hoes is dragnets, policin the mark-made
I be peepin liquid hoes trippin in dark shades

The Magnet make em bounce back like elastic
Plottin on my assets, I play past it
Overflowin hoes' domes like coffee cups without lids
Cause I'm liquid

[ VERSE 2: Saafir ]
I keep mines overflown, over grown
You keep me overblown like a jazz saxophone
At your home by your request and my yes yes y'all
You wanna brawl me cause you're feelin fawlty
Cause I pulled the sunglasses off my nose and told you
I don't ride around town with hoes but I can mold you
But only if you want me to, but don't gas me
You want me all over you but yet you can't grasp me
You're passin to the next pair of tits to get advice
From another trick that's older than you but born slow
Keepin the shit super twisted like a cornrow
You're not fuckin with a semi-pro where the eagle stopped
On a status quo, I can share half my area
But you have to learn to board this here aircraft carrier
I hope you're not flower like a clarinette
Especially when I'm sharper than a berinette
But knowin your gene pool you'll forget that pact
We made over uncracked ??? and a fat-ass sack
I used to think time with you would be ageless
Now you're in court tryin to garnish all my wages
Only till I situate underground and stash shit
Before I let a liquid ho liquidate all my assets

I can smell that ass a mile away
You just a smell away from crazy but you can aid me
As a monarch if you try and fade me with the wrong heart
Shit might happen without it bein said, sendin you postcars
All the way from the edge
I know it's that mental magnet in my head
That's pullin and resurrectin you from the dead
I got this sick magnetic attraction indeed
To those in dire need of some satisfaction
I'm no pretty boy poster pin-up
Don't concentrate on my looks or we'll end up
At the end of (butt naked)
