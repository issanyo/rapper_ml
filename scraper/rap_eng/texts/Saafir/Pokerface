(Nobody move) --] Smoothe da Hustler

Ugh
Yeah
Ugh
Yeah now fuck that
Check this out, man
Youknowmsayin?
All you niggas with them muthafuckin pokerface on
And don't know how to pull no real-ass cards
You step your punk ass back into the plaster, nigga
You understand me?
I'm not tryin to feel you
Straight up

Pokerface

[ VERSE 1: Saafir ]
Cash in your chips, I'm hot, I got the fever
Where the dealer?
Nobody move, it's my turn
I'm shakin the dice of life with a tight grip
I'm flippin the numbers, mayn, a hustler that be lovin pain
You better watch the dice cause they be runnin game
The name don't fit the face mask and all my whole nine
You ???? with a .45
And I bust it through your pokerface
Cause I know it's fake and simple ??? pimp
Seein through your face like ??? on a ho named Pimples
Yeah that's what you covered with
Pits all in your face, no deeper than dimples
Niggas is shallow but I'm knowin
Cause I got the nostrils that knows I'm the shit
Smell me, really do ???? a lots intoxants
You can't peep me, keep my face, you frostbitten freaky
My grill stayin in 3-d
You, you, you can't, can't, can't see, see, see me, me, me

Who got the dice so I can take your life
Cash in your chips, I'm hot, I got the fever sittin on a block of ice
Still can't peep me, keep my face, you frostbitten freaky
And I stay cocked

[ VERSE 2: Saafir ]
You cats is rappin with jokerlips
With them corny-ass stiff comedian-ass ingredients
Fly niggas get broke like (what?) kites
When you gamblin for your life with only two poker chips
Strip, click-clack, you know that shit
Niggas shakin the dice like mice runnin a rat race
Well in that case rewind a nigga twice like Christ
I'm rockin his daddy's ice (that's some cold shit)
We give a fuck about ridin a trick in a Six
Or decoratin a vagina with diamonds
Playas that need to get traded
And dropped off on a slave island in the Caymans
A granddaddy at phrasin
And a master at assemblin ass in pasture when it's grazin
I'll pull your broad like a horse
And I'm holding the reins cause I'm alway reignin, I'm always flamin
I stay high when I'm bustin, I stay cock-poppin
You cocky-ass Rocky's
And lady, I ain't the father of your baby, ho
When your pokerface look like mashed potatos and gravy though
You need to eat, huh? You look the part
But you don't walk the talk
The toes are like ten lies on your feet
When you speak no heed
You couldn't bake big pies with the recipe
If I leave you in a darkest den you likes to see the rest of me

My pokerface is so straight
I can buy the painting of Mona Lisa
With a Visa
Or you can invest in me
A real shark at the bottom of an infested sea
The style is on the run, my rap sheets is deep
But the hip-hop police ain't arrestin me
Move that vehicle, this ain't the streets you park on
Start dippin into some parkin lot pimpin, move out that marked zone
Unplug your microphone and turn on your VCR
And watch this porno star
Leave your ass like gas
Stuck and fucked and mad
Rippin the doors off the hinges
Jealous niggas wanna kill me cause I'm in they hood like a engine
I'm just idlin with a game of God fame
And broads got you doin strict crossovers like Iverson
These herbs be herbed, Chinese vitamins?
Nah, these niggas need verbs
That's so cold to keep hype niggas in furs (brrr..)
I'm gone, one, bum-ass dumb nigga
My pokerface got nerves
