Released I'm down count it's a
Lifestyle for the regular
No five. O you may catch me in some
Old British Knights
Some mark fives no cellular hobo
Brova's are ready to go
Concentrate fundamentals I extend
My defense give my man the ric some
Breathin' room fresh air see sparks
As he strikes the bounce
Is on 'cuz brova's got runnyn' pass
Game the aim is for me to rip
Shit up I like nut in ya cup I don't give
A motherfuckin' fuck
Wit style it's the bignose the pro-file is
Ta rip brova's be pullin'
Cards it's the bignose (I'm out)
