Song: No Return (Goin' Crazy)

In a slow silent walk I hear tha
Violent talk I hear them talk half
Asleep as they stalk what the man
Is in this moon I'm punctual
Like a star I've harbored
Death that stale taste embraced by
My
Breath such mysteries in kissin these
She devils tell me ya pretty by the
Lamp in your attire nutthin at stake
I must vampire her retire mint funds
I switch the essence when I found
Out my girl was not a blesson
Hatred seeps in she sleeps in my
Man draws what's wrong? I'm taking
Life long leaps my freak was late by
The hour she's in the shower with
Him grim thoughts to nightmares
Women in millions when they sleep
Will reep the broth wraped in
Mummy's cloth a blurred touching
Who feels that delight I'll have you
On emotions walkin butt naked down
Streets at night stripped of
Your stripes around ya mind a vine
Of thorns terrible beauty
Still born the spirit of pity whispered
But lyrics middi blistered into babies
These shady ladies be hatchin hades
You'll burn no return goin crazy

Unnatural vices are fathered when
Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry
Season
Pry treason out the mask upon the
Hills
Where every little creek is shot with
Silver bullets that is no problem I
Have a barrel of assorted verbs let
Me pluck-one
Fuck you much too dwindled and
Harsh
Dead on white and cloudy clear
Saafir
Oh I'm ya son I'm told oh you mean
The
One that turns copper into brass
Asses
You got a weak chassis ya blood
Owns
No bones on the cash the selling of
Ass pockets dribble chestnuts and
I'm that pimp chimpmunk soakin
Sponge
Ya funds up I still roll with game
But lane changing slowly irritates the
Fuck out of me comes my confusion my
Mind
With images voices from my
Education
Said to me he must be killed sticks
And stones break him off touch his
Ash
No more hate puddles covered with
Glass the aborted birth from a
Burning
Bowel in a distorted earth woth
Phrases I fell mazes concocting
They're
Not going to feel me I got
Cockblocking
Jumping off a bridge Reg a fool I'm
Cooler
Than pool I'm deep deeper than a
Dimple
But my smile is not so simple
Impervious insert this shit you got to
Be
High to fade me fuck it let's go crazy

Don't you stare at me don't glare
At me what do I see a wound we
Have the exhibit of pain rugs wit
Bloodstains neckties and fangs eyes
Brains I'm coverin roads like Vogues
Drink the flows I'm telegraphing
This punch the hunchback of
Oakland unloadin on the spokin
Unconventional the stench of the
Arouses the nostrils of the hostile
I'm strange in my untried game
But I'll get the same response
But arise the paralyzation has been
Lifted Ponce de Leon couldn't find
This flow a fountain that spans
Beyond the mountains of a man's
Limitation comes the unhygenic
Schizophrenic I'm shittin in it
Don't phase me could it be that I'm
Goin crazy
