[Intro}
Yeah man
Its this motherfuckin Swig of the Stew for the nigga in you
Mothafucka, can you get wit this crew?
Try to test this motherfucker turn ya fuckin bangers blue
Somebody pass me this beer, ima listen to Saafir
On this motherfuckin next time...
Who got this motherfuckin next rhyme?
Its my partner over in this motherfucker

[Verse 1]
Another massive dose I'm sendin' in
Hittin' when I step to the deck
Sidebets kick 'em in then raise up then jet
From the ivory it's time for me to see if I can
Graze the cut... just a hit
I'm shuttin' down ya pistons
You'll have to listen cause I'm...
Clippin' off the wack bracket shit that's soft so
Go back to the troft and put it back next to the Smirnoff bottle
Where u found it from it sounds
Numb has no feel
An organic synthesis did I mention this in the last verse?
No. I drive a fast hearse
They'll have to catch the flow I'm...
Snatchin' a row of burnt corpses and...
Hopin' they learnt the forces that they're up against
Is immense in this shit
With a fist to this grill is still a fraction
Of common sense
You would want Providence to play a part but it's obvious
You have no heart
I'm pro-truding a pro-tracker
The proportion of a slacker is where I store the shit so
Give me ya cup
What's ya flavor?
It's juice taste it
A swig of the stew

[Chorus]
The funky nomadic attic dweller (3x)

[Verse 2]
Now that I have a deepdish spoon
Niggas be attackin' get blackened eyes like racoons
Blew up like balloons busted
They're getting rusted, thrusted with them screw drivers
Who's the livest? Me!
And I love it when the
Slug rubs another from a rusty life they uhh
Couldn't cut it so I cut 'em with my trusty knife
Skinned alive and when deprived of one's life
One thinks twice. Three time a lady
Lionel couldn't pay me for you to fade me
Cause I be learnin' shit
Makin' tourniquets from broken English
I'm yokin' the seamstress cause
I'm sewin' up shit
You know I can rip, I rest with the Hobo's
Yo yo's stays up
No Mayonnaise on the cut
But I can bust it wit the mustard
My spice is hot
The radish adds this seasoning that creates and make
Taste buds wanna make.. dubs of a
Swig of the stew

[Chorus (x5)]

[Verse 3]
Box Car 23 is my freight train
I'm not strippin' for the cock except the diesel
The weight gain
I make pain and I take it cause I'm humble
A dirty rat, A sturdy gat is the back up for the smack up easy
For me to pack the knack up
Braggadocio rhymes I'm braggin' while I'm laggin'
Saggin' cause my jeans hafta be lean for the cuisine
So... Who dat!
Dick Dasturdly could never master me
Drew raps... constantly after me comes me, stop
Suction cupping you got nothing coming
But cum of bum...
Hon, I'm doin' it for my niggas in the
Oh ak land where I plan my escape
From traits of empty crates and
Busted grapes are not part of the gourmet
Hey just an appetizer
Filet mignon but the song is the stew
