[Verse 1: Big Krit]
M-I crooked now
I never left the crock pot bitch I'm cooking now
Old school ferris wheel rims got me looking down
Country boy making noise world lookie now
Might just throw some D's on it, I got moves to make
On time with these thoroughbreds, my money never late
Don't be bothered with these lames, you should elevate
I got bottles for the poppin' maybe we should celebrate
Money over everything, what'chu know about it?
Bed full of bad bitches, I canâ€™t roll up out it
Playa you should never doubt it
Talking live from the underground
It's forever going down

[Verse 2: Big Krit]
This that diamond in the back flow
Bitch, I got enough I wish you had mo'
Ho, they used to chuck the deuce and past go
Now, I'm the one you niggas ask foe
I'm talking dirty gutta south
Pimps with the curls and the golds in they mouth
Old school cars, doors on slam
Big country girls, ass like damn (DAMN)
I'm on it now, I been a king
Million Man March in my trunk, you hear the dream (get it shawty)
Cornbread pimpin' throwing collard greens
Poppin my collar feeling clean
Ahh

[Verse 3: David Banner]
Twist yo fingers, make a M and throw yo hands up
Twist yo fingers, make a M and throw yo hands up
If you from the south and you proud nigga gon' say it loud
If you a working class nigga or got slugs in yo mouth
From the land of the Ku Klux with no mask
And my folks shit they never had the rebel flags
Still flying bitch you lying, if you say we ain't hanging
From a tree Frederick Carter Greenwood Mississippi
Emmett Till til now, how I'mma talk about hoes?
Where Medgar Evers got killed in front his family, body froze
Raynard Johnson, Andre Jones, and my folks in these jail cells
They call it suicide, cause it's just another black male
Yea!
