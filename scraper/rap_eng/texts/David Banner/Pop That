[Chorus]
Hey, baby girl, what's your name? Who you with? Do you wanna get down with this pimpin lil chick? Pop that thang, girl; pop that, pop that, pop that thang, girl. (2x)

[Verse]
Pop that thang, gone shake it for daddy
You looking good when you up in the Caddy—we comin' down. (Uh)
Then we up in the club, high as hell, we ain't givin' a fuck—with ya screaming' out
(Oh) Name the pot for me;
Later on you can gone ride on top of me
Now, we can blow another sack, forget about the 'Lac
Keep the block and bread—daddy a stack
It's like that!

[Chorus]

[Verse]
I ain't lying, I get weak for the freak
She's so sweet the way she pop, pop, pop, them butt-cheeks
She got gold in her mouth;
Always hollerin' about the South
If the boys came through, now, she's putting up the house. (Oh, yeah!)
It's true, boo, what I'm doing to you
They way you come through the crib when the night is through
And go down, say this' what they loving us…
Now, they really wanna be you, but they don't know how…

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
She looked so good when she came to me
Said, "Boy, you better pay. I don't pop for free!"
Put it like this, you can suck my peter
Or, even go home cause I really don't need her!
I like girls that'll pop it all night for me
And, if another bitch trip, she'll fight for me
And, she ride on top like a rodeo
She be poppin' in the club 'til it's time to go

[Verse]
(Uh) Then, it's straight to the 'Lac
Screaming, "Bitch better gimme my scratch—believe that!"
If the boy started to trip then it's click-clack!
Pimp, grabbing my hand like they the Mack
(From the mighty, mighty, Mississipp, don't trip! Just come here, and pop for a pimp.)

It's all love…
Come and pop for you boy, in back of the club
When it's over, then maybe you get a hug!

Chorus:
Pop that thang girl Pop that thang for me (3x)
Yeah Yeah Pop that thang
