(Traffic on Mars)
Yeah Yeah
Yeah
An amigo stuck in traffic
Just pull on my khakis
Amigos in the kitchen
Cookin' like Benihanas
No shrimp scampi
Bully seen 'em
Now he fallin' like Bambi
'Cause his radio blastin'
What you gonna tell his family
Call me Michael Jordan Davis
I do a little ballin' on the side
Just like Cass

Couldn't even get a green card
On St. Patrick's, tragic
Now you gotta go back to trappin'
An animal marred, fuck the world
With a USC Trojan, Mark Sanchez
Walkin' in the White House
With a mariachi suit
Vicente Fernandez
RIP to the soldiers
No Reebok Classics

Smokin' in the spaceship

Smokin' in the spaceship

Smokin' in the space

Smokin' in the spaceship

As I roll up to Marvin
Tell me what's going on?
Now or be quiet
My people, they startin' to diet
My people are starvin'
They startin' to riot
It ain't black enough, I'ma dye it
Screamin' 'bout hope
I say, nope, I don't buy it
Screamin' 'bout keepin' my promise
And keepin' the hope in the streets
While I'm smokin' on Sweets
In the suites in the Hyatt

I'm high, ain't no secret
They got to leak it
Love big or small level
More like Monique it
I need me a lighter
The heat, I'ma seek it
Like missiles in drawers
Take some clothes and I peep it
As deep as a bitch
Deep as abyss
Another one dead
Gotta keep me a list
Who got the change?
Who got the change?
I'm goin' for blasting the Range in this traffic

Traffic on Mars

Smokin' in the spaceship

I won't be on top of the crop
All this bullshit that's on the ground got me
(Smokin' in the spaceship)
Ride 'round, smokin', admirin'
In my mind, let me zone out
'Cause I be (Smokin' in the spaceship)
Ah, yeah

I roll up to my hell yeah
My squadron, ride deep through regalia
Right over these crackers
Green grass and azaleas
The Devil's alive
But see, body won't fail ya
Inhale you a pound
Then pray for who sell you a pound
Went to Hell and I'll tell you who I found
Don't sell out your chrondo
Get nailed to a cross
And get nailed to the ground

It's 'bout to go down
There's more in your town than my town
A whole lotta soldiers
And just by the minute
Gon' need more lieutenants
And captains and generals
There's murder for minerals in Ghana
So I'ma blow this marijuana
In honor of all of the
Daughters and mamas
That live under Boko Haram
A dreamer, believer in magic
But stuck in this traffic

Traffic on Mars
Traffic on Mars
Smokin' in the spaceship
Traffic on Mars

Smokin' in the spaceship

Traffic on Mars

And we're smokin' in the spaceship

How is it not an issue?
That according to the Department of Justice
In a study released in 2004, black and latino males
Are three times more likely than white males
To have their cars stopped and searched for drugs
Even though white males are four and half times more likely
To actually have drugs on us on the occasion when we are stopped
Now think about that
Because that suggests that racial profiling is not just racist
We know that, that is redundant
But it's also pretty stupid-ass law enforcement
Or is it?
Because I guess it's only stupid if you think the purpose of the war of drugs
Is actually to get drugs off the street
