[VERSE]
I'm feeling something in the air
But they know where they can find us
I see a circle full of squares
They letting anybody sign up
I say subliminals ya best bet
It ain't ya destiny to say my name
So pump ya brakes before the car wrecks
And your supporters probably feel the same
Always ready cause them 'Ville niggas trained to go
And when I see a problem I'mma always take the same approach
Learn to hustle before another nigga show the ropes
And I'mma chase this paper before I see my niggas going broke
Stay 100 cause the city don't respect a joke
And "this ain't what they want"
That's some shit I'm bout to make a quote
Who the realest?
Bet these niggas wouldn't get a vote
And you ain't gotta wipe me down
I'mma let it soak
Got this bitch locked
I run shit without shoes on
Plenty niggas done took shots
So my shit list got too long
Nigga rope up
Then jump off
They sharks all through this water
They talk hard, but they heart soft
So real niggas place that order
Bitch this that authentic
That's 10 toes, so I'm all in it
We bi-winning, no Sheen thou
Took it over night like repo
Got a mind state like Nino
Skin tone like G- Money
Bad hoes still on the clock
And they legs open like 8:20, uh

[HOOK]
Cross my heart and I hope to fly
Never coming down
So niggas never come around
(repeat)
Recognize, 'fore I make it clear
Gotta a problem we can take it there
Niggas betta know that this the year
I predicated 2012
And now it's finally here

I'm feeling something in the air
Niggas finally see they time up
See I could never be compared
I'm at a height you couldn't climb up
Ain't in my city but I rep hard
I'm still living like I'm carefree
And I ain't never had a pulled card
Cause ain't a nigga ever scared me

[HOOK]
Recognize, 'fore I take it there
Gotta a problem, nigga make it clear
Niggas betta know that this the year
I predicated 2012
And now it's finally here
