[Hook x2: Jodeci sample]
Do you believe in love
And the promise that it gives?
I wanna love you for life
Cause your love is why I live

[Verse 1: David Banner]
Banner when you coming back? Tell me when I ever left?
I got two tatted on my spine you on my mind in every breath
Have I ever went on TV and not call your fucking name?
Yeah I slept with other dames, but my love for you don't change
Give a fuck what haters say, bitch go drink some Gatorade
Bitch I get that money too, never wood all in your face
But when I'm gone I'm gettin' cash, while them niggas on they ass
Fat as fuck fallin' off while I keep my foot all on the gas
Keepin' my hand all up on the grain
God on my heart, money on my brain
I got a little money but my heart didn't change
I bet a mothafucka gon respect your name
Don't smoke that much, ain't on that dust
Keep some hen all in my cup
Take my fingers twist them fucks
Say your name and throw it up

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
You always on my mind when I'm on the road
Doing shows, puttin' it down
For me and you, I remain true
And represent till' I'm underground
You do the same just as I would change
Hold your curb while the caddy swang
On them fuck niggas that ain't fuck with ya'
Cuz of your past, until I came in yo life
I ain't ashamed to call you my wife
All these other hoes been' trife
Ain't no secret I be creepin', but I dedicate my life
To your warm embrace, skin as soft as that red clay
Heart beat like a 808, in my old school when I blast the bass
Rep this here all in they face
Proudly say you in a southern state, of mind
Ain't no other worth my time
And when I set ya' out, you shine
For the world to see that you was meant for me
And I love you so
Mississippi I'm foreva with ya' through thick and thin
I just need to know, do ya'...

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: David Banner]
Why they wanna talk about us?
They ain't never really gave a fuck about love
They ain't never really gave a fuck about you
A fuck about me, the S to I-P
The J to A-C
The D to A-V-I-D, B-A double N-E-R
Rolling up 55 like a split cigar
All of my folks yellin' out "You can't make it nigga"
I did though for my kin folks
You can't crush my heart its been broke
In your river I been soaked
When I hear your name it gives hope
Don't smoke that much, ain't on that dust
Keep some hen all in my cup
Take my fingers twist them fucks
Say your name and throw it up
(Scratches) Yeah
