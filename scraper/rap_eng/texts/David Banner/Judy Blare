Oh yeah, I want to take her home, give her a loan so she can see my place
Think I wrote her number down in ink so it won't be erased
Adam and she eating, I see Eden when I see her face
Bonita Applebum, I bum her apple, I just need taste
That model body bottle shape, I cannot escape
Wonder Woman's here and gotta wait, she ain't got no cape
Got her make up on and got a date, these girls gotta hate
She said she gotta work out kinda late, took her outta state

When I got home in the sky
There's a space in between
There's a look in your eyes
That gets the best of me
So we can come to the chains and get out of the lights, girl
Show me your courage, we can fly to new hights
The look in the eye says, come set you free
The burning inside takes over me

Oh yeah, I think I feel in love and I don't play with love, I love to play
Show you right, I know you right
Got prototype, that's worth two drinks
She just thinks excuses, I can't even think of words to say
She's use to dudes in tennis shoes
Don't run to her, she runs away
That movie star, name in lights
Layman terms ainâ€™t her type
Money just can't buy her love
And still the try to name her price
She got it, she got it
It feels so good, I have to say it twice
Say it twice, girl, you hot, girl, you hot
Stay on ice

When I got home in the sky
There's a space in between
There's a look in your eyes
That gets the best of me
So we can come to the chains and get out of the lights, girl
Show me your courage, we can fly to new hights

We're being taken over by domestic terrorists
Those domestic terrorists will now allow you to collect rain water
Water is the essence of life
