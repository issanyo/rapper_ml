In this biatch
Hit that
I'm f**ked up
Shit
YEAHH
All the soldiers stand up...my lord............
My lord......
YEAH

Chorus
My lord I'm losing my soul and my mind the devil creeping cause I keep on fallin' behind
My lord I'm losing my soul and my mind the devil creeping cause I keep on fallin' behind
My lord I'm losing my soul hey, I'm losing my mind, my lord I'm losing my soul hey, I'm losing my mind

This hennesey got me on my knees screamin' God please
Let my people be free who fightin' off over seas
For a man who don't give a f**k who steals slaves
Jesus I'm tryin' to walk the path that you gave
Goin' down a new world order
Got my boys on the corner tryin' to flip a quarter
I'm in the east coast
I'm tryin' to soak in this dirty ass water
And my ex girlfriend said I got a little daughter

Chorus

I got more places where niggas wanna kill me fill me with slugs
I got some nuts they suck cause I don't give a f**k about nothing
Mane Michelle died, a nigga cried and I let it go
I gives a f**k about a hoe
Give me dough my nuda my acres
Bustin' at you fakers killin' you quakers in the name of my maker
Patty cake patty cake bakers
Man give me land
I'm tryin' to live life in Gods plan man damn

Chorus

Yea, searchin' the raggly tags for what I'm bout to ask
Lord I be feelin' all alone and I'm goin' fast
Another day in the high feelin' goody good
Still the same ole weed mane it's understood
Pop pop and gone in the wind victims of ghetto war
Busted up and over seas what are we fightin' for
Something busted in me pussy niggas trip
But I stay ready for you bitches with the extra clip
Killas that live on the side so I get aim at fame
Triple crossin' bosses they so quick to erase yo' name
Grippin' the grains is a slide that's goin' about my side
Lord I hope I know I'm doin' wrong I know you still by my side
Losin' my mind

Chorus

YEAH YEAH
Yea south side nigga ahhh
Shit what you talkin' about nigga
You know what I'm saying all the time nigga
Memphis 10, Mississippi
South side stand up you know what I'm talking bout
