[Verse 1: Don Trip]
Still spendin’ off last year
My dear, get more pussy than a pap smear
Bitch I’m balling with my club like Paul Pierce
Glock 40, fade away shot, pear
I’m still fly enough to fly a lear
Matter of fact I’m fly enough to say hi to Aaliyah
What I sell doesn’t come with a bill
Our kind of syrup doesn’t come with your meal

[Hook: David Banner & Don Trip]
Niggas think that I'm playin'
‘Til I grab the AK and start cussing and sprayin'
I do work
I’m just tryin’ to stay as fly as I can
You know dope boys don’t get retirement plans
Work
Niggas think that I'm playin'
‘Til I grab the AK and start cussing and sprayin'
I do work
I say work
I got work
I’m rich and got work

[Verse 2: David Banner]
I’m praying for forgiveness, crying, blood in my eyes
I’m tryna do better but somebody gotta die
Fuck with Don Trip with the Mickey Mouse clip
AK-47s, Mac 11s, let’s get a bitch, counterfeit
Kick doors, hoes tied up with some duck
I stopped smoking weed, fuck it, gon light it up
The movies and the money mean nothing to my manhood
Who disrespects me nigga, I leave you dying in some fuckin’ woods nigga

[Verse 3: Don Trip]
Hard work, but no steel toe
Never had an honest job or bill folds
Just a plug and a scale and some elbows
And we ain’t kicking it, we ball, no field goal
Bussin' heads over here, no deals hoe
Tell you go and fuck yourself, no dildo
Fuck your government, I probably never will vote
Nigga, Tony Montana our hero

[Hook: David Banner & Don Trip]
Niggas think that I'm playin'
‘Til I grab the AK and start cussing and sprayin'
I do work
I’m just tryin’ to stay as fly as I can
You know dope boys don’t get retirement plans
Work
Niggas think that I'm playin'
‘Til I grab the AK and start cussing and sprayin'
I do work
I say work
I got work
I’m rich and got work

[Verse 4: Don Trip]
Down South ain’t been the same since the hurricane
Niggas lost extended clips and the everything
See the judge give you time for a square cane
Thirty years for a ki is not a fair change
I’m free but believe I feel their pain
So I got this bitch covered like Vera Wang
Full time trap nigga, probably never change
Back to wrapping Christmas gifts up in cellophane

[Verse 5: David Banner]
Gas high like giraffe cock
80 tornadoes, Bin Laden got his ass popped
4 floods, oil spills, niggas keep it real
Bush and Halliburton made over 2 bill
I-O-N, sin sells, niggas out here dyin’
Women famous of off who rich nigga dick they ridin’
Ha, yeah! Y'all say reality shows
But in reality y'all bitches ain’t nothing but hoes, y'all

[Hook: David Banner & Don Trip]
Niggas think that I'm playin'
‘Til I grab the AK and start cussing and sprayin'
I do work
I’m just tryin’ to stay as fly as I can
You know dope boys don’t get retirement plans
Work
Niggas think that I'm playin'
‘Til I grab the AK and start cussing and sprayin'
I do work
I say work
I got work
I’m rich and got work

[Outro: David Banner & Don Trip]
Niggas think that I'm playin'
‘Til I grab the AK and start cussing and sprayin'
I do work
Dope boys don’t get retirement plans
Work
