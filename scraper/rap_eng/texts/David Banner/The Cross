[Intro]
Our religions tell us that we came here to suffer, that life is a valley of tears
Suffer today, have patience, and when you die, you will have your reward
Sounds beautiful, but it isn't true
Yeah

[Chorus: David Banner]
They asked me if I'm lost, I tell 'em naw
I'm trynna get Jesus off the cross, yeah
They asked me if I'm lost, I tell 'em naw
I'm trynna get Jesus off the cross, yeah

[Verse 1: David Banner]
Molecular blood shit, secular clubs rip
Spit tribal verbals, you're liable to get your dome split
Meditation walk through my mind, bitch it's a long trip
Acid, scholastic, Fantastic Four, bitch it's Jurassic
Park plastic Glocks spit, nine blast it
Bastard flow son to none, style is immaculate
Conception, my mind's mechanized to see farther than Mechanik
He-man, hey, rule, fool, phone check
Niggas in line for the school to prison pipeline
Imprison the mind, and the body'll follow
Life sucks, get bucks, bitch, and I'll bet she'll swallow
Fellatio, you and I, homeboy, no ratio
Black music, no soul is like De La Soul without Maceo
Posdnuos, what's the use? They won't listen
Is David Banner Muslim or Christian?
It doesn't matter motherfucker 'cause I'm back on a mission
Yeah

[Chorus: David Banner]
They asked me if I'm lost I tell 'em naw
I'm trynna get Jesus off the cross, yeah
They asked me if I'm lost I tell 'em naw
I'm trynna get Jesus off the cross, yeah
Now let him walk
Now let him talk, to your soul
Let him walk
Now let him talk, let him talk to your soul

[Verse 2: David Banner]
I'm just askin', murdered with a cross
They nailed Jesus to the wood, now it's time to take him off
He could walk, he could talk to your soul about slavery
The preacher got problems, he ain't trippin' on savin' me
ATMs and [?]
Go together nowadays like them Cadillacs, vogues, and rims They had the bibles, we had the land
We knew to pray, they took the land
They ran the scam on you man, God-damn

[Bridge: Malcolm X]
As I say, if we bring up religion
We'll have differences, we'll have arguments
We'll never be able to get together
But if we keep our religion at home
Keep our religion in the closet
Keep our religion between ourselves and our god
But when we come out here
We have a fight that's common to all of us
Against the enemy who is common to all of us

[Chorus: David Banner]
They asked me if I'm lost, I tell 'em naw
I'm trynna get jesus off the cross, yeah
They asked me if I'm lost, I tell 'em naw
I'm trynna get jesus off the cross, yeah
They asked me if I'm lost, I tell 'em naw
I'm trynna get jesus off the cross, yeah
They asked me if I'm lost, I tell 'em naw
I'm trynna get jesus off the cross, yeah
