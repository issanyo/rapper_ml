Aay! Houston Texas, Houston Texas
Chamillionaire, the Mixtape Messiah
I feel like niggas need to show some respect off in here mayne
Tell 'em the name, tell 'em the name, Chamillitary Mayne

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
I hear ya talking that talk (that talk), I heard you was talking bout me (bout me)
Soon as I ask who you talking to, you reply with "naw it's not me" (not me)
No bite but all of that barking, cow-mad that y'all ain't got me
They ain't keeping it real like they talking, pussy niggas is all that I see

[Chamillionaire]
You could be hungry, ugly, chubby, homeless, crippled and blind
And still be better off than niggas talking lip to a nine
I hit that track wit David Banner, talk that lip to me now
Pussy niggas like to hide, pop up on 'em, surprise
Tired of letting niggas ride, gave 'em too many times
I'm sick of trying, sick of uuh, flipping and flying
Now they got me yelling out what like a skit from Jon
Chamillitary ain't gon' ride? Y'all need to quit ya lying
Cause ya know that ya falsifying, niggas know they can't stop the giant
It just shows that'll stop the crying, move over the spot is mine
Take over it's about the time, to put all these boys in line
Couldn't walk a inch in my shoes but you know can drop and tie 'em

[Hook]

[David Banner]
If it jumps off, it jumps off, let the front of the pumps off
Something that'll knock ya fucking lump off
Think I'm 'Bama? Think I'm country? Well I am bitch
And I got bullets I can share and I ain't selfish
Dirty boy I got just what you need
Them slugs that'll fly through trees and knock off knees
Knock off ears, knock off peers
Got beats that'll knock by-see-ers, roll but get the throat cut
Catch a buck fifth, watch yo chest lift
Dope rhymes, cause the small lines take a sniff
Bitch I'm tryna make ya nose bleed
Like Russians busting the shit out of Apollo Creed, I'mma ride!

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
Yeah, better respect the Messiah, ay where the hell is ya manners man?
Knock ya offa ya hinges like you got hit wit a batter-ram
You'll be stupid for challenging, knock ya outa ya skeleton
You'll be down on the floor like a Lil Flip or a Banner fan
The hustle man, I hustle a grand like dude in Atlanta
Then what I do wit it? Flip it, kinda like that dude that he mad at
The talking stops when a rocket is sending you out the planet
You'll be just Timber in a Lake like that dude feeling Janet
That could get you shot or damaged, I bet that you cry or panic
That could get you cut, beat the hell up, then goodbye, you vanish
Put your feet on the concrete, I hope that you got 'em planted
Now stand flat, so I can BLAT! Make you loose all your balance, Koopa

[Hook]
