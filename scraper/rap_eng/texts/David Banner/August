[Intro]
What is the God Box? (I was searching)
Who is the God Box? (Everywhere)
Are you the God Box? (But there)
I don't understand... (Or here)
Can you help me?

[Verse]
(Yeah) I didn't run from the mainstream, I swam right through it
A salmon with the flow, the way I move through the fluid
Spit druid, red fluid seeping from your caesar
Selfish with the mic, a Mississippi Ebeneezer
(Yeah) Chef Curry, no pot
Klay Thompson in the third against Shaq with the Glock
(Yeah) Thirty-seven, block, block
Yeah I'm conscious but the pistol that I got still pop
(Uh) I need every Iguodala
Yeah I spit it how I live it while you gargle and you swallow
(Yeah uh) They call it follow-through
I took a jump shot but didn't break my wrist like you
Ooh, but it's the motherfucking truth
I have nothing against them but I do against you (against you)
(Yeah) 'Cause you motherfucking lying
Yeah, you spit it like a gangster while these kids here dying (dying)
And these crackers out here trying
To make melanin, I'm telling them (telling them)
Bitch it won't work
You want God? I think I seen God in a skirt (in a skirt)
(Yeah) She had deep black skin
But she was looking for herself on the out and not the in

[Outro]
Sigh, I love you (I love me too)
The God Box
I love me too
