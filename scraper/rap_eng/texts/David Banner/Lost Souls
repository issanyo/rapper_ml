[Chorus]
This is for my thug niggas, all the pimps and the drug dealers
Thieves and the muthafuckin killas (Save our souls)
The ones who ain't never had shit
That's why we get crunk in this bitch
This is for my thug niggas, all the pimps and the drug dealers
Thieves and the muthafuckin killas (Save our souls)
The ones who ain't never had shit
That's why we get crunk in this bitch

[Verse 1]
Daddy in the pen, mama out sucking dick
I ain't never had fam so I ride with my clique
Shit I'd die for my clique! Jealous hoes die too
I would have been a lawyer by the age of 22
But I won't, so I don't give a fuck about killing you
I sell crack too, I will jack, dude
I dropped out of school to buy my daughter some food
And her mama don't live around here no more
They took her life when they kicked in my door
Yelling, "bitch, where the dope!" then blaow blaow blaow!
They thought I was a beast, tell the bitch look now
I'mma smoke my weed, I'mma fuck me a ho
I'mma want your dough, I'mma kick your door
I'mma slap your ho, I'mma take your date
When I think about the Lord I got to see one day
I'm sorry... (damn)

[Chorus]
This is for my thug niggas, all the pimps and the drug dealers
Thieves and the muthafuckin killas (Save our souls)
The ones who ain't never had shit
That's why we get crunk in this bitch
This is for my thug niggas, all the pimps and the drug dealers
Thieves and the muthafuckin killas (Save our souls)
The ones who ain't never had shit
That's why we get crunk in this bitch

[Verse 2]
I'mma get me a 'Lac, I'mma ride down 10
I'mma pray to the Lord I won't die in the pen
Gotta serve for my sins, I'mma serve me a copper
Gotta watch my back for them fucking undercovers
(Fuck the cops! Fuck the PD! Fuck em, bitch!)
I'mma come to the crib, I'mma flood my block
I'mma ride downtown yelling "Fuck Trent Lott!"
They done raped grandmama, they done took our land
Now they wonder why a nigga don't give a hot damn
Damn
Damn

[Chorus]
This is for my thug niggas, all the pimps and the drug dealers
Thieves and the muthafuckin killas (Save our souls)
The ones who ain't never had shit
That's why we get crunk in this bitch
This is for my thug niggas, all the pimps and the drug dealers
Thieves and the muthafuckin killas (Save our souls)
The ones who ain't never had shit
That's why we get crunk in this bitch
