[Verse 1:]
Too much money for a spit, these bitches can't see me
I told em they just chasin, they could catch me on the TV
Got that triple 8, stays before the kids that keep a PG
All my dancers, swear to God I roll you for the Fiji
These bitches always tryna hold a bitch back
Pussy on a pedestal, now tell them hoes kiss that
Nowadays I'm feelin like fuck a hater feelings
'Cause they got me fucked up like sex on the ceiling
I'm a take now these hoes is tip tippin on my dick
I'm in Texas like I'm Trae Tha Truth, sippin on that grit
Hold a temporary visa but thick as a southern man
And if ya'll mad at that I'm just tellin I'll fuck em wild

[Hook:]
I don't gotta chase money 'cause the money's always chasin, chasin me
I don't gotta look for fame 'cause the fame is always reachin, seekin me
And I know you came down, make it look easy
I wanna know how
Guess that's why you're chasin, chasin me that long

[Verse 2:]
Cheese in my briefcase, bread in my backpack
Laugh at niggas chasin money askin where the cash at
They chasin me, hope the riches kept on a fast track
And big dog paper, pussy niggas got cash stacks
Ridin in that turbo Porsche, Panamera hatchback
Something worth 100K, nigga can you match that?
Checks OB and hit the bank and say how can we cash that?
Quarter mill I'm finna shoot, nigga he on snap backs
He lookin for the fame and I'm lookin where he had that
100 million dollar ring, hoppin in and out of Range Rovers
I ain't know, you both get away from me, you bad luck
Hyper speed, like I gotta let the money catch up

[Hook:]
I don't gotta chase money 'cause the money's always chasin, chasin me
I don't gotta look for fame 'cause the fame is always reachin, seekin me
And I know you came down, make it look easy
I wanna know how
Guess that's why you're chasin, chasin me that long

[Verse 3:]
Your Maybach white, the whole roof is transcended
My bitch talkin but you can't understand Cuban
I'm high as a fly, Audemar, fan coolin
I'm putting 30 big grills up on the 10 million
Now that's a 10 you could play
Watchin cartoons in the Jag, Jimmy Neutron
I really go bananas, this will catch yo mouth and shit
Relocate your chess, you'll never bout to suck yo bitch
Uh, I'm on my Rocky Balboa shit
Overseas with my whores, ball ball and shit
Full of chrome, I got a Jones like no one click click pow
Don't get aroused, I ain't chasin

[Hook:]
I don't gotta chase money 'cause the money's always chasin, chasin me
I don't gotta look for fame 'cause the fame is always reachin, seekin me
And I know you came down, make it look easy
I wanna know how
Guess that's why you're chasin, chasin me that long
