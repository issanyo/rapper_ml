[Intro]
Yeah, like I said it's your boy Lil B

[Verse 1]
Bitch I own swag, I'm a star like I'm in SAG
I'm so fab like I'm in Sac, I tote that Tec and I hold that Mac
Got a few scratches up on that gun
I straight spit like I ain't got no tongue
Bitch came asking me questions
"Where's my car?" Bitch which one?!
No Lil B then it ain't no fun
Everything cool 'til I bought that blunt
If you talking weed bitch I got that gun
Pour me a cup, bitch let's get drunk
I'm Karl Malone, I just dunk
I'm so high...
Oh but this weed got me high bitch
It's straight from the hood, shit
Evil Based God
Drop my top and I don't get robbed
Never say never but I never been robbed
Try to jack me go get a day job
Like Mac Dre that's not my job
But that's my bitch, ooh shit
She told me things I wouldn't even say
Went on a date and I fucked her face

[Bridge]
You know I'm more famous than you, than you
And I can do everything that you can't do, or try to

[Verse 2]
Hasta la vista, I'm looking for a se√±orita
Mexican, Brazilian, Nicaraguan, that's what I meant
Two, bring two to the ranch and pass 'em
Put 'em all down I don't pass 'em I cuff 'em
Yes bitch I said I cuff 'em
Fucked her in the ass that's where I nutted
Popped a viagra and I'm feeling like Mase
No homo bitch I'm a take that case
Real talk bruh I'm a fuck her in the face
Met a pretty bitch, here all day
Sitting on my ass making a mill all day
Call me Obama Based God, call me Obama Based God
...A-Rod!

Fucking bad bitches
Yankee, Yankee Based God
You hating on me that's not my problem
We living in a world where people talk shit
Suckas kiss ass, and they hoes suck dick
I don't gotta problem with a ho sucking dick
But she better be clean when she suck my shit
Niggas get mad cause I talk a little shit
I don't even care, ass so square
I'm a bad boy like Dilinjah
