No matter how hard it gets
You can make it
God loves you, I love you
We love you, we really do

You know and um, for me
It ain't about nobody else
It's about me, you know
And if I have to do what's right for my spirit

And do what's right for God
And do what's right for these kids
And do what's right for my people, alone
Then this is what I gotta do

But I don't believe I have to
I believe the world is ready for it
Sex, drugs and video games
