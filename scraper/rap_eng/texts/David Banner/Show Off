[Intro]
That's how I know she a freak
That's how I know she a freak

[Verse 1]
Baby I ain't looking for love
And I gotta tell you, you the baddest thing I seen in this club
And I know you probably done been with every baller
But I'm still tryna see what's up with you girl
And baby if you want us to be alone, yeah
We can go somewhere where nobody will hear you scream
You gon' be begging when I got your legs up, sorry girl I fucked your head up
But you said put it on you and that's what I'm gon' do

[Chorus]
It never really mattered to much too me
Cause tonight's the night for love
It never really mattered to much too me
I'm gonna lay you down, take you down, just call me daddy, kissing you girl
It never really mattered to much too me
Got you open, I'm in it, in it
Got you soaking making your body
Girl you wanna freak me yeah
So go 'head and show off
And you can take it off
Lemme break you off
I know you 'bout to show off

[Verse 2]
Got my car outside wanna ride let's go
And I don't drive let my chauffeur do that or we can take my boat
And I'mma put a stack on it
I could take you places all them lame niggas can't go as I’m going in and out of you
So now we driving down this back road, her hand on my thigh
She look me in the eyes and she started pulling me close
I said I wanna get freaky, she said yes just as long as I don't go
I gotta stay 'til the morning and baby it never really mattered

[Chorus]
It never really mattered to much too me
Cause tonight's the night for love
It never really mattered to much too me
I'm gonna lay you down, take you down, just call me daddy, kissing you girl
It never really mattered to much too me
Got you open, I'm in it, in it
Got you soaking making your body
Girl you wanna freak me yeah
So go 'head and show off
And you can take it off
Lemme break you off
I know you 'bout to show off

[Bridge]
This is for my ladies who got a man but they don’t let her wear what she want to the club
He be hating, nigga you better hope she don't meet me
Cause I think she look better naked and now she's in my presidential suite
Her body's on me, sick of being lonely, she make some new positions then she tries 'em on me

[Outro]
That's how I know she a freak
That's how I know she a freak
