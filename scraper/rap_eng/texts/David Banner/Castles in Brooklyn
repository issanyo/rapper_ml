[Hook: David Banner] ×2
Got a castle in Brooklyn, got a castle in Brooklyn
Got a castle, got a castle and a bitch, that too
Got a castle in Brooklyn, got a castle in Brooklyn
Got a castle in Brooklyn, that’s where I dwell

[Verse 1: David Banner]
I got a bitch chipping dumpo, met her in the Gucci store
She love to eat brunch of Felipes have Porsche, wild girl
Fasten your city ball, me? I like to hit and go
Her body looks so damn good, I bought a condo
Is Brooklyn man in the house, hell yeah I bought a house
And when this snow outside I mean the mouse
If you see me murder alone she down south
Tryin to get all the good white folks the hell out

[Bridge: David Banner]
If I am in the south I’m out west and chillin in Brooklyn
If I am in the south I’m out west and chillin in Brooklyn
It’s Brooklyn in the house, it’s Brooklyn in the house
It’s Brooklyn in the house

[Verse 2: Maino]
I got a bad bitch from Fort Green and dime out in Red Hook
A girl from the Style and a queen that’s from Flatbush
Shout out to my Brooklyn bros and addicted to that Louis Vuitton
No one how to grind hit the mall with them credit cards
Diamonds in my audemar, back the back the corner store
Bitch we let em fight before we fuck, I swear to God
Gucci, rock a Louie scarf like a bandana
So I introduce the system to my nigga Banner
Never change, I got love for my down girls
That did it all for the heights on Groundsville
Fuck em all my Brooklyn chick with a clown still
Still rolling non-stop like it’s down hill
Yeah nigga take my Brooklyn chick everywhere
Thorough bitch man, she adapting everywhere
Yeah she got a condo where the Nets play
Took me to junior’s in the business for my birthday

[Verse 3: David Banner]
I’m on the Bridge Brooklyn my nigga I’m in a Bentley
Then stop on Fulton and Saint James pour out some Remy
Then it’s to Bedstuy my Prada chick, her name is Chanel
All her clothes is Prada but, all her shoes Chanel
Listen Junior, I got cheese plus cake
Flyin’ on the interstate, always in and out of state
Jay bought the Nets and I ain't talking 'bout Leno
The crib that I bought in the borough is not a rental
