(Whos that peeping in my window
My folk dont understand so they dont take us serious)

David Banner:
Everybody wanna rap but y'all don't seem sincere
Do you realize the pain going on round here?
Think about the things that we putting in these kids ear
Is parallel to slave stories told by Ma Dear
I'm a man with a plan since fifteen on the corner
With some beats in my hand all rapped in Saran
Selling getting cash, stacks, wrapped, smacked in rubber bands
I was just like you, little n*gga skipping school
Smoking weed trying to fuck something
Then I had to move
Yeah God made me choose, the dope game, rap, or school
Cause its all fucked up
That's word to my name, Now we All Screwed UP
Bitches popping pills Now they all juiced up
Black women raise your kids
Cause we don't need a lil n*gga in the pen dodging dick
And I know it sounds six six six
Oil spills on the coast but BP STILL RICH
Man them white folk ain't going trip
Katrina, now this, they trying to break our spirits

The devil in the form of a lick
But niggas wannt rap, play sports and chop bricks x3

This is David Banner's
Mississippi country grammar
Im sick of all my n*ggas praising living in slammers
Board up your window neighbor, and save that peace shit for the pope
Cause there's a war going on, and its all about dope
The rich is getting richer and the poor is getting broke
Meanwhile niggas hating on my twenty-two spokes
On my caddy I eyed Cali cause I had to have more
Then a Pyrex visit, trying to flip a little coke
Yeah I love black folks
We gotta do more than smoke
I got a flow like Muhammad when you up against the ropes
Every verse from now on is a muthafuckin Quote
For you f*ggot ass rappers, bending over for the soap
Yelling pause grand dad, NO ____
Star bitches in the crowd like I'm Tony Romo
I got a heart like a pit
Got beats like a pimp
I'm a man amongst women, let y'all play the bitch
Got Boo on deck and too BIG K.r.i.t
Still articulating words with our southern accent
Biitch

It's the mixtape song my n*gga
