[Chorus]
It's winter time, and we still cannot find a job
We fill out applications but you treat us like we're slobs
So we rob, and we steal
We're just tryna get a meal
Cuz it's Christmas time and we're broke again, broke again

[Verse 1: David Banner]
My baby's callin', she needs some warm shoes on her feet
So give it now, or catch the fire when I'm bussin' the heat
Man I tried to get a job, now it's back to the streets
Man, gimme what I want, or I'm makin' you leak
See, I met my first victim comin' out of the club
And that motherfucker stuntin', comin' through on dubs
He the local dope slanger, I ain't givin' a fuck
He gone catch four slugs if that bitch don't duck
We gone rob that hoe, get that cash
Bust a motherfucker if he don't move fast
We gone rob that hoe, get that cash
Bust a motherfucker if he don't move fast

[Marcus]
Man, fuck that nigga, gimme mine
Get the fuck down, bitch don't make a sound, hoe
Or you won't see a next time
Take off that chain, tryna shine
Drop off that money, weed, and them crystals in this bag
Or taste the tip of this missile
Bitch, we ain't playin'!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
No candle light, on Christmas night
Just the sound of the block in a police fight
Six years old, no Christmas clothes
Daddy locked up, violating parole

[David Banner]
Fuck that shit, motherfucker, take em to war
Santa Claus don't come if you don't got dough
So I'm tryna get ya paper, 'fore I buss on ya, bitch
My daughters crying, and you looking like a lick on Christmas

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Marcus]
Smoked out, locced out
My baby crying, something bout her pain done spoke out
I felt the same
Hit the streets like I was James Evans
Come back with something [?] with that .357
Don't ask no questions
I been stressin', ain't no time to talk
Don't fuck up this bid or blue steel from this [?]
Rubber peel from the assault
As I get away like Mobb Deep
Didn't know he was clicked up, partners trailing behind me
But fuck them niggas, I'm a rider, bitch I turned around
Cock back and buss em, hmm
I know that make a thunder sound
This Smith is bound
So respect the shit I breathe and claim
And everything I get, you know my folk gone see the same
Two to the brain and I'm bout higher than Neptune
Step out the Chevy with that heat, bout to blow ya balloon
'Sho as the moon is full
Marcus take another pull of the spliff
Cock it back, I got a breast, bitch
Watch as it open it

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
What about the children?
I hear them sing the blues
Cuz they ain't got no Christmas toys, plus they need new shoes
Makes me feel so sad sometimes
Feel I'm gonna lose my mind
Hopin' we don't fall behind
The ghetto has no Christmas time
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
