First take, let's go
Uhh
[Verse 1: Twi-Lite]
I kill you softly fugee, thinking you a player
I'm a player 2 Luigi, Never tucked in boy
I don't wear no jockstrap
Pop her cherry then I pop her apple
You know Imac, pacman flinstoned vibrate flip phone
Got a spanish chick who fly high no jim jones
When it's time to buss, keep my mask on phantom
Set it out to do it, so we'll do it big magnum
Imagining a big full filled with cash money
Got some bad bitches, make your nose runny if you act funny
Find me on another level, got this bitch her name is treble
And she lives right next to bass
And they down for whatever
J's on my feet, middle finger to my haters
Got my Bob Marley jacket on, word to jamaica
Cuz my steez be phenomenal, balling like a Laker
While she's on my Harley Davidson, I'll be undertaker
Uhh they be like Twi why you go so hard at the door
Cuz it's the only exception, Paramore
Foot on the gas, hittin on corners, never letting go
You be just like Fergie, Black Eyed Peas we had to let you go

[Hook: Twi-Lite]
Face Off in this bitch
Swag Swag
Kamakazi in this bitch
Swag Swag Uhh
Swag Swag Swag
Aye yo she ready for the cut
I know she ready for the cut
Y'all niggas fucked up.. uhh
Let me tell you one time bitch

[Verse 2: Twi-Lite]
Cuz I be on that next shit, You be on that same shit
Rocking to some ASAP Rocky, on some purp shit
Spent 50 dollars on my kicks, never counterfeit
G shock now I switch to rolleys on my Will Smith
Fresh Prince
Seperate them legs like Moses and the ocean
Your gauges, playing with my Tiger Woods awesome
You know I don't ever give a fuck, I'm in my own line
Pretty Ricky swag, got your chick all on my hotline
I'm good for the girls, I be like lifetime
And don't you hate a girl when she's on the shy side?
But if she gets on my side then it's sunshine
Piper her down with a smile, viagra
Man I go hard like my grandpa
While you looking mad, I'm hitting gas gokart
Flow nasty like a goat fart, This is art
No Mozart go hard, I'm a Pornstar bitchh
I'm a Pornstar Bitchh
