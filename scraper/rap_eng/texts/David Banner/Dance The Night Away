Look at your body, your man needs help
Stop your selfish, I get next
Take my hand, I'll do the rest
Tell me what you want, girl, is it S-E-S-E-X?

Daddy don't want you hanging with a thug
I bet he's thinking we go, ha ha, ha ha
Breathe real hard, the sweat is dripping all over your body
Let me give you what you're missing

Grab your coat, grab your coat
Slap your car, slap your car
Girl, let's ride, girl, let's ride
Girl, let's ride, come on, let's ride

I feel the need to sleep ya, to sleep
Me and you should be dancing in the sheets

I can do what I want to
I can play by my own rule
Come with me let's just dance the night away
Don't worry 'bout what I do

Watch me as I move on the floor
And let's dance the night away
Whoa, the night away
Come with me and let's just dance the tonight away

I've been thinking we should get lost all of your clothes
Let's take them off except them pumps
Leave them on your feet, girl
Give it to me now, I'll make you weak, girl

Hey little woman, what you gonna do
Live in the past, move on to something new
I ain't tripping on your friends, they can come too
We ain't go much time for acting brand new

Oh no, I don't follow no rules
I do whatever I want to
Ot's my life and I can't be
Like you I can only be me some call me a rebel

You wanna be one let's go
It's your life so gonna do you
Don't let no one control what you do

Grab your coat, grab your coat
Slap your car, slap your car
Girl, let's ride, girl, let's ride
Girl, let's ride, come on, let's ride

I feel the need to sleep ya, to sleep
Me and you should be dancing in the sheets

I can do what I want to
I can play by my own rule
Come with me let's just dance the night away
Don't worry 'bout what I do

Watch me as I move on the floor
And let's dance the night away
Whoa, the night away
Come with me and let's just dance the tonight away

Oh no, I don't follow no rules
What your daddy keep telling you
What you're gonna do
I do whatever I want to
Three, four let's going to go

It's my life and I can't be
See girl, come with DB
Like you, I can only be me
Take my hand girl, you can be free

Look into my eyes girl tell me what it is
The club not yet ?
We can dance all night
Your choice, let's live

Grab you coat, grab you coat
Slap your car, slap your car
Girl, let's ride, girl let's ride
Girl let's ride girl let's ride

I feel the need to sleep ya, to sleep
Me and you, we should be dancing in the sheets

I can do what I want to
I can play by my own rule
Come with me let's just dance the night away
Don't worry 'bout what I do

Watch me as I move on the floor
And let's dance the night away
Whoa, the night away
Come with me and let's just dance the tonight away
