(Intro) [David Banner - Cadillac on 22's plays in background]
I think for the most part, our generation is filled with a bunch of fuckin' cowards
And I say that man, because we beef amongst eachother...
We kill and we shootin eachother in our own hoods, and bang eachother
We won't bang cops, ya know I'm sayin?
And one thing that these motherfuckers in America know...
They know we-they know we ain't gon' do shit (Do shit- Do shit)

(Verse 1, David Banner)
I'm grippin the nina, visions of 9/11
Visions of three sixes, no sevens
This is Bush-enomics
George is a modern day Ronald Reagan
I pray to God, in the midst of Pagans
Niggas, I'm just sayin
When do we stop playin?
When do we stop pimpin and start sprayin?
Fifty shots for every cop that popped Sean Bell, his body layin
But they acquit
Because they know that our generation won't do shit!
Nothin; nada
But every rapper is a shotta or a don dadda, or a killa
But you ain't killin nothin in this piece, unless it's another nigga
Tryin'a raise boys to supermen
And while I'm at it, FUCK Arthur J. Cooperman
It's never justice for blacks, but they send just us to Iraq...
With poor whites and Latinos
I pray to God that you hear this single...
This is Banner's MIDDLE FINGER, y'all ignant!

(Hook)
I've been waitin in the hood for so long
I've been waitin in the hood for so long
For some niggas to stand up in here
We some soldiers, and we have no fear
I've been waitin in the hood for so long
I've been waitin in the hood for so long
For some niggas to stand up in here
We some soldiers, and we have no fear

(Verse 2, David Banner)
Ms. Kathryn Johnston was murdered by police...
In Northwest Atlanta, but I don't hear it in the streets
Where the anger in the hood for this old lady dyin?
D.C. six, ain't shit but cops lyin
Ain't shit but bullets flyin
Thirty-nine slugs from undercovers, FUCK the law!
This was somebody damn grandmother...
And she died over crack sales
Crooked ass cops, or some niggas tryin'a flip yayo
You ain't have to sell it in her yard
You ain't trappin, bitch you yappin to the motherfuckin guards
And I got a damn question...
Why the city ain't pissed off?
When I know y'all heard shots, and old lady got hauled off, y'all ignant!

(Hook)
I've been waitin in the hood for so long
I've been waitin in the hood for so long
For some niggas to stand up in here
We some soldiers, and we have no fear
I've been waitin in the hood for so long
I've been waitin in the hood for so long
For some niggas to stand up in here
We some soldiers, and we have no fear

(Outro)
I wanna see a nigga riot or somethin dogg, fight for somethin!
Fight anybody but'cho motherfuckin self, nigga
We sell drugs, but we gon' sell drugs to our self
We bang, but we only bang on our self
We do every fuckin negative thing and niggas is so hard...
Niggas on radio, on cd's, on tapes, and on movies, they got guns, they got pistols
But ain't nobody shootin it at nothin but they self
FEAR is the only thing that people respect
We forget everybody but ourselves
These cops gon' have to FEAR somethin, somethin have to HAPPEN
Nigga if y'all gon' march, march to the motherfuckin cops house, my nigga
Make these motherfuckas FEAR somethin, dude
Cause they make- they got us scared!
They got niggas scared to go to strip clubs, nigga, you know
Shit, my nigga, like... somethin gotta happen
I'll say it my nigga, cause I ain't scared {*Cadillac on 22's resumes*}
I ain't scared of shit, I'm scared of God...
I'm scared of God first
And I'm scared of taking the blessing that God has given me-
And leading somebody down the wrong path {*echoes*}
