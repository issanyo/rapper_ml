[Intro: David Banner (Vocal Sample)]
Big Face Entertainment, nigga
KLC—Hahaha
Yeah, Medicine Men
Mississippi—yeah!
(My daddy says this land ain't no better than Mississippi)
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

[Chorus: David Banner]
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
Where you from? (Westside)
Where you from? (Eastside)
Mississippi ’til the day that I die
Bitch nigga
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
Where you from? (Southside)
Where you from? (Northside)
Mississippi ’til the day that I die
Yeah!

[Verse 1: David Banner]
I'm a Southside nigga from the state of the ’Sip
Where the Gs and Vice Lords give me love on the strip
There go the cops, nigga, don't swallow your rocks, rah
I got a gun, cock it back, block-block-block
KLC on the beat, pussy pop, pop
On the floor, girl, let the ass drop, drop
Cadillac, wood wheel and rag top, top
Some got Ds, others let their blades chop, chop
I give a fuck about a coward-ass nigga in my click
Got some bitches with no tits that hang around for the lick
Got some hoes at the show, who can trick, suck a dick
Pussy nigga get quick, we some trill ass pits (woof)
With some AKs that spray, bullets your way
On their knees, God please, five deuces, four trays
I'ma kick this real ticket, nigga, watch what I say
When y'all raise up out the pen, we gon' see a better day

[Chorus: David Banner]
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
Where you from? (Westside)
Where you from? (Eastside)
Mississippi ’til the day that I die
Bitch nigga
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
Where you from? (Southside)
Where you from? (Northside)
Mississippi ’til the day that I die
Yeah!

[Verse 2: David Banner]
Where you want it, my nigga?
In your head or your gut?
We done stepped up in the club, ’bout to tear this bitch up
Man, I'm back from Houston, Texas
Chopping game up with Hump
Stopped in Baton Rouge, KLC done gave me some bump
Got some ana with a nigga on the Eastside and shit
Gotta teach ’em Mr. Crump didn't raise no bitch
Or no ho, or no lame, cock back, take aim
Bitch I'm calling out your name
’Fore I'm busting out this thing
Hollow point whistle out, taking pieces of your brain
Southside, motherfucker, bitch, you think it's a game?
We done struggled too long to lift our hands off the grain
Mississippi, when I start and when I die it's the same
So I'm gripping, never slipping, tighten up on my pimping
Coupe de Ville so trill, tap that ass then I'm dipping
Coming back with [??] Sweets, now it's time for the flipping
Trailblazing bitch niggas like my last name was Pippen

[Chorus: David Banner]
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
Where you from? (Westside)
Where you from? (Eastside)
Mississippi ’til the day that I die
Bitch nigga
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
Where you from? (Southside)
Where you from? (Northside)
Mississippi ’til the day that I die
Yeah!

[Verse 3: Smoke D]
It's that nigga Smizznoke
Clamping motherfuckers' nuts
Mr. Get In Your Ass, it's speedy and lil' fast
Nigga what the fuck is up?
It's really on like light switches
Which is the reason I come to wreak havoc
Amongst you sons of bitches
I'm not concerned with who you be
Unlike these other plastic motherfuckers
I want your ho to come fucking with me
My nuts swang to the floor
Y'all motherfuckers talking like you love it
But I know you bitches hate me though
I showed you love, and in return you try to take me fast
You rotten maggot motherfucker, I'ma get your ass
You know exactly who I'm talking to
I want your brains on motherfucking plate
You dirty fucker, you
We throwing niggas hot lead parties
Guaranteed to fuck you up
And put a hole in your ho body
I gots to be the man I'm supposed to be
And as a man, I must execute your ass
When you fuck with me

[Chorus: David Banner]
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
Where you from? (Westside)
Where you from? (Eastside)
Mississippi ’til the day that I die
Bitch nigga
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
Where you from? (Southside)
Where you from? (Northside)
Mississippi ’til the day that I die
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
Where you from? (Westside)
Where you from? (Eastside)
Mississippi ’til the day that I die
Bitch nigga
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
What it do, motherfucker, what it do (what it do)
Where you from? (Southside)
Where you from? (Northside)
Mississippi ’til the day that I die
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
