My gal don't wanna be a bitch no more (No more)
I don't wanna be a nigga, sick of drinking
I just wanna get my money right
I don't wanna pop no mollies, I don't wanna kill nobody
Kids dying up in Chi-town

If you feel me, put your lighters up
Until you burn your damn thumb
Till you burn your damn thumb

Miss Obama, tell your husband that we hurtin' (We hurtin')
He promised change, but it hasn't, ma'am I'm certain
These streets are killing bills
Our kids are poppin' pills
You can't blame 'em, hot dammit in the club
They just tryna run away from pain
What if God already came
And we missed the damn boat?
Ask Katrina, black folks don't float so well (So well)
And I guess that time's gon' tell (Gon' tell)
They say I'm selfish, rap records don't sell (Don't sell)
No mo' (No mo')

These are the tales of my burning thumb
These are the tales of my burning thumb

My gal don't wanna be a bitch no more (No more)
I don't wanna be a nigga, sick of drinking
I just wanna get my money right (money right)
I don't wanna pop no mollies, I don't wanna kill nobody
Kids dying up in Chi-town (Chi-town, Chi-town)

If you feel me, put your lighters up
Until you burn your damn thumb
Till you burn your damn thumb

Trayvon, Jordan Davis, didn't make it (Didn't make it)
Lord save us, they enslave us, free labor
We didn't ask to come here
It's so hard, I'm praying on my knees that I won't just disappear
On the soul of some dead slaves
I never pledged to your damn flag (Fuck that)
This is the best sex I ever had (Ever had)
'Cause black folks got fucked over and over and over
I'm so sober and I'm clear
You know I don't wanna hear everything that you said
I ain't playing, need some burning thumbs

My gal don't wanna be a bitch no more (No more)
I don't wanna be a nigga, sick of drinking
I just wanna get my money right
I don't wanna pop no mollies, I don't wanna kill nobody
Kids dying up in Chi-town

If you feel me, put your lighters up
Until you burn your damn thumb
Till you burn your damn thumb

My gal don't wanna be a bitch no more (No more)
I don't wanna be a nigga, sick of drinking
I just wanna get my money right
I don't wanna pop no mollies, I don't wanna kill nobody
Kids dying up in Chi-town

If you feel me, put your lighters up
Until you burn your damn thumb
Until you burn your damn thumb
