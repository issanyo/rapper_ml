[Chorus: Chris Brown & David Banner]
I be going HAM, I be going crazy
I be going hard, hard enough to have a baby
They go, "Oh," and tell me I'm amazing
They go, "Oh," and tell me I'm amazing
‘Cause I be going HAM, I be going crazy
I be going hard, hard enough to have a baby
They go, "Oh," and tell me I'm amazing (ow!)
They go, "Oh," and tell me I'm amazing (What? Ow!)
Oh

[Verse 1: David Banner]
She said she headed my way, pronto
Come up to the penthouse suite, condo
She only come over to get beat, bongo
Come tonight, stay until the mornin', Alonzo
She said she tryna come, can I assist? Rondo
Headed to the bedroom? Nah, follow
She like a wack rapper, no spit, swallow
She told me I'm the best and I respond, “Yeah I know," that’s sort of like my motto
I see it in her eye, a little fear, Madam
Hop up in my push-back seat, Phantom
It only happens for a small few, no random
Now let me shoot it in your Mariah, Cannon

[Chorus: Chris Brown & David Banner]
I be going HAM, I be going crazy
I be going hard, hard enough to have a baby
They go, "Oh," and tell me I'm amazing
They go, "Oh," and tell me I'm amazing
‘Cause I be going HAM, I be going crazy
I be going hard, hard enough to have a baby
They go, "Oh," and tell me I'm amazing (ow!)
They go, "Oh," and tell me I'm amazing (What? Ow!)
Oh

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Hey lil mama, won’t ya freak some?
You and your girlfriend together, that’s a threesome
You're my sex slave, don’t want your freedom
We do it over and over, here we come
Hey lil mama, won’t ya freak some?
You and your girlfriend together, that’s a threesome
You're my sex slave, don’t want your freedom
We do it over and over, here we come (yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I be going HAM, I be going crazy
I be going hard, hard enough to have a baby (ow!)
They go, "Oh," and tell me I'm amazing (ow!)
They go, "Oh," and tell me I'm amazing (ow! Hey, hey!)
‘Cause I be going HAM, I be going crazy (what?)
I be going hard, hard enough to have a baby (ow!)
They go, "Oh," and tell me I'm amazing (ow!)
They go, "Oh," and tell me I'm amazing (What? Ow!)

[Verse 3: David Banner & Chris Brown]
Come over here, baby
Hop up in my sweet front seat, Mercedes
I know that you had a couple drinks, faded
Said she feelin' good, let me, make it
Better than it was so what you think, later?
You could meet me at my hotel suite, naked
She was like, "Nah," I'm like, "Pssh, better take it"
So used to being regular, she don't understand a man ten steps ahead of her (oh)
Yeah, I can change your decimal
I'm your lottery ticket, have you scratchin' like eczema
Ha, she seein' lights like casinos
And I'm askin', "What ya all up on me for?" 'Cause we go

[Chorus: Chris Brown  & David Banner]
Ha, I be going HAM, I be going crazy (ha!)
I be going hard, hard enough to have a baby (ow!)
They go, "Oh," and tell me I'm amazing (ow!)
They go, "Oh," and tell me I'm amazing (hey, ow!)
‘Cause I be going HAM, I be going crazy (what?)
I be going hard, hard enough to have a baby (ow!)
They go, "Oh," and tell me I'm amazing (ow!)
They go, "Oh," and tell me I'm amazing (What? Ow!)
Oh

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro: David Banner]
She only come over to get beat, bongo
