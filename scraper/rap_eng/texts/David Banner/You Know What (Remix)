[Avant]
I been looking for you for a long damn time
But you been gone away I nearly lost my mind
And now we're in the club and you're grindin on me. touchin on me. got me goin crazy
That skirt you wearin got a playa on swoll
As I glance at my watch I see the night is growin old
I start to reminse about when we were shorties, back seat of my jeep, yes I'm feelin horny
As I play my position posted up on the wall
Happy to hear the DJ say last call
Cause what that means is we about to leave and I'm about to be all up on you and you up on me

[Chorus]
Cause I want you
In the middle of the night I'm gonna rub
And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste
And if it's all said and done I'm gonna
You know what
You know what
Cause I want you
In the middle of the night I'm gonna rub you
And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste you
And if it's all said and done I'm gonna
You know what
You know what
[Avant]
It's hard to keep in touch while you're off in school
But now you're right here we can do what we do
Start in the car and end up in the livin room
Kiss around your navel while you're on the end table
Pushed the magazines down on the floor, I'm your soldier so I'm ready to go to war
And you told me you're hot and you're ready
Legs won't stop shakin, just give it to me daddy
And I like the way your body's lookin right there
Knowin we might not even make it upstairs
And what that means is just relax your mind and baby let it flow it's goin down and that's for sho

[Chorus]
Cause I want you
In the middle of the night I'm gonna rub
And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste
And if it's all said and done I'm gonna
You know what
You know what
Cause I want you
In the middle of the night I'm gonna rub you
And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste you
And if it's all said and done I'm gonna
You know what
You know what
[Lil' Wayne]
Get fresh off the g.fo
Need no intro
Weezy baby nympho
Him so.gentle with it
Still got mamis limpo
Little woody put his thang down like mutumbo
Young dude, rich, smart, humble
Got something downlow to make your walls crumble
Not rough though, slowmo, promo. we could go video. uh uh true that's right
Nasty that's all in me. how he rappin got women like he R&B
What you know about your legs in the air, with your head in the chair, with my hands in your hair
We could go there if what I'm sayin sounds fair
Don't trip I kiss every lip don't flip
Flip up the doors on the out of country whip
I could take you out of this world baby let's dip

[Chorus]
Cause I want you
In the middle of the night I'm gonna rub
And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste
And if it's all said and done I'm gonna
You know what
You know what
Cause I want you
In the middle of the night I'm gonna rub
And if you let me go down I'm gonna taste
And if it's all said and done I'm gonna
You know what
You know what
