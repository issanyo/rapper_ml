Got a bitch
Got a bitch
Ya'll know me
Mississippi ho, I'm a real O.G

Yeah! (x8)

If ya sick of being sick, and ya tired of being broke
Go get yo guns and bring yo ass to saint's row
(Saint's Row!!) Bitch!, (Saint's Row!!) Bitch!
If ya wanna do the led on the flow, Bitch

I lost it, I steal 'cause, nobody cares how I feel but Saints row! (Saint's Row!!)
Saints Row (Saints Row!!) (x2)

Ya left me in the middle of hell wit no hope
Ya put me in the trap wit straps and no dope
No food no water, kids drownin in the mist
I ask god why my people gotta live like this
I loot, I shoot, Getcha ass that's survival
Police, two bit slugs on the rival
Helicopter's come, but they leave wit nobody in em
Send em all to hell wearing gasoline denim
My dirty white T is as bold as my outfit
Aw that's the black fist
Middle finger up like antennas
Gather up the kids, they can live wit David Banner

If ya sick of being sick, and ya tired of being broke
Go get yo guns and bring yo ass to saint's row
(Saint's Row!!) Bitch!, (Saint's Row!!) Bitch!
If ya wanna do the led on the flow, Bitch

I lost it, I steal 'cause, nobody cares how I feel but Saints row! (Saint's Row!!)
Saints Row (Saints Row!!) (x2)

This Is For Gulf Boy
Long Beach Past Christriana
Watch a grown man crying, life slippin from his hands
America is fake, and ain't never gave a damn
But they'll Bust they ass to help out a foreign land
Can't live wit myself and not ride for the weak
Little kids can't eat, bodies floatin in the streets
G.B. on the TV givin a fake speech
If I die, then I'll die tryna feed Mississippi
This is 8 times worse than inner 9/11 was
Hurricane hit, 3 days, No help cuz
And I wonder where my president was..
I wonder where my president was..

If ya sick of being sick, and ya tired of being broke
Go get yo guns and bring yo ass to saint's row
(Saint's Row!!) Bitch!, (Saint's Row!!) Bitch!
If ya wanna do the led on the flow, Bitch

I lost it, I steal 'cause, nobody cares how I feel but Saints row! (Saint's Row!!)
Saints Row (Saints Row!!) (x2)

Yeah! (x8)

Saint's row!
Yeah!
Saint's row!
Yeah!
Saint's row!
Yeah!
Saint's row!

I lost it, I steal 'cause, nobody cares how I feel but Saints row! (Saint's Row!!)
Saints Row (Saints Row!!) (x2)
