Paroles de la chanson Westside :
What up Cellski (Westside, westside)
All my pimps in san diego uhhh (westside, westside)
See whats wrong with these niggas, they dont know how to respect there elders
Whats up hammer (yo) Spice one! (Ohh!)

[Refrain]
This is for my Compton niggas, Inglewood watch
The whole westcoast nigga each and every block
O-Town, Long Beach, Niggas in the bay
The homies in pomona, back to san jose
Krenshaws lost in the black 6-4
SAN BERNARDINO to Sacramento
All day, End day, Everyday
Mississippi slash californ-i-a

[Verse 1]
Im the Coldest Nigga, Walkin` Heavin`
And im tryin to choke the game till it stops breathin`
You betta betch ya im ya favorite rapper cause its only scheme in
I've been rappin since Rakim but im steel *Feenin*
The westside and the map man they show me love
So im gonna give it back with a double up
I miss quick, i miss reen, i miss snoop and dre
I miss E-Z on the cover with an AK
I miss Cube screamin out it was a good day
E-40 too short MCA
And a pimpin ass nigga named Ice T
JJ Fag, ya'll are cuttin on the techniques
A nice stroll on the beach show a nigga good
My essays, chins up rep up ya hood
Man we all from a place like mississippi
Ya from the west throw ya dubs up if ya with me
WESTSIDE!

[Refrain]
This is for my Compton niggas, inglewood watch
The whole westcoast nigga each and every block
O-Town, Long Beach, Niggas in the bay
The homies in pomona, back to san jose
Pkrenshaw lost in the black 6-4
SAN BERNARDINO to Sacramento
All day, End day, Everyday
Mississippi slash californ-i-a

[Verse 2]
King T, messin marv, them boys from the lich
C-bo and the crazy muthafucka brotha lynch
San Quin, mac 10, booya keek the sneak
A rappin 4 tay givin pimpin to these freaks
Sugar free ant banks, rest in peace mac dre dawg
The pound came down representin LA
DJ Poose, cypress hill, hirogliphics, bad azz
Dub C comin through crip walkin on yo ass
Im a southside nigga, tell em hoes lay it down
And i can't yell pac without digi underground
And my nigga cartoon put my state on my back
Look a ride for ya nigga, Choke a pimp, luv that
Death row ya, turn no battle, pad bitch, chan, long beach VIP
And a nigga named pam
Till the day that i die i'll be yellin` mississippi
Nate Dogg clarks cale westside ride with me

[Refrain]
This is for my Compton niggas, inglewood watch
The whole westcoast nigga each and every block
O-Town, Long Beach, Niggas in the bay
The homies in pomona, back to san jose
Krenshaw lost in the black 6-4
SAN BERNARDINO to Sacramento
All day, End day, Everyday
Mississippi slash californ-i-a
