[Verse 1: Black Thought]
215
I got the wordplay of Wallace, work ethic of Shakur
I was sent into to the future with a message from the Moors
I went to war, my weapon just a blessing from the lord
Rest assured that my pen is more mighty than a sword
I got plans, I'm taking my revenge like Roxanne
My man swam here from Mississippi, god damn
Y'all fall for anything, that's the shit I cannot stand
We on that CMB, basically all we got fam
Y'all know my lineage is godliness and cleanliness
Otis used to sing how we should try a little tenderness
But they ultra envious, crazy disingenuous like
Who need a enemy if that's what type of friend you is
I pull off capers and Don Draper a skyscraper
Defy nature, leave 'em stuck like fly paper
Who ever said we not at the top of the totem
Smoking Lamar Odom
You bring the bar lower, we pack 'em and bar code 'em
After it's all over I capture the far nova
Back to the Mars Rover then
Let Sankofa supply me with the Gamma
I smash the vocal booth and turn back to David Banner, nigga

[Chorus: Watch The Duck]
Who want it?
Everything that they can fuck with it
Ain't not 'ceptions, anybody anybody get it
Anybody get it
Who want it?
Everything that they can fuck with it
Ain't not 'ceptions, anybody anybody get it
Anybody get it

[Verse 2: David Banner]
FOX, CNN, and white crooked police
Y'all can all eat a dick
See I tried king's peace
Kids dying in the streets, crack sold over beats
See, religion is a leash, it's all slavery to me
Niggas to gods, gods to niggas, niggas I'm grown
Demons on the internet, they got eyes in your home
Eyes in your cellphone, eyes in your dollar bill
See they raped my grand-mammy
Then they call it God's will
I'm a glitch in the matrix, but you choose your own pill
Kneel to the almighty
It's my second time asking what happened to Chris Lighty
Or Prince
I'm convinced that they they lie
Pffff ... then they tell us that it's drugs
Or suicide
Then they sweep that shit under the rug
Fuck a plug unless he has a key to get free
And a boat strong enough to drag a ship across the sea
See I shitted on the game, but I now I take a Master P
Aquaman with a contraband and all y'all pet
Little bitches in the sea and alla y'all will get wet
It's the reign of the Tech, y'all fuckers get the Beatnuts
Yeah, I love the craft, but tonight, bitch, I beat guts
Encore, if I clap your scalp then your feet touch
Guns with your finger and a trigger don't mean much
Nigga, who want it?

[Chorus: Watch The Duck]
Who want it?
Everything that they can fuck with it
Ain't not 'ceptions, anybody anybody get it
Anybody get it
Who want it?
Everything that they can fuck with it
Ain't not 'ceptions, anybody anybody get it
Anybody get it
