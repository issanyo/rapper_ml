[Hook: Rudy Currence]
They say I am an Urban Myth
They say black men don’t exist
Prove them wrong won’t you marry me, marry me!
And they say I’m nothing but a stat on a sheet
But here I am on my bended knees
Prove them wrong won’t you marry me, marry me!
So I’m asking every woman and girl
All over the world, if you wanna get married, you can marry me
I know you’ve been hurt, so let me be the one who puts you first
If you want to get married, you can marry me
Marry me

[Verse 1: David Banner]
I will wrap my soul around this ring girl
If I could that’s what you mean to me
Give me your hand and your heart girl
I swear it’s safe for eternity
Baby I can feel your pain
Let me heal your pain
After, leave with me you’ll never feel the same
I’ll still the plane, fly over hills and plains;
Reach in the clouds; even steal the rain
So a seed can grow, believe me you know
I’m a king, you’re a queen I’ll leave you no!
Got you covered in the best gold
I know you see the threshold
Come get carried, let’s get married

[Hook: Rudy Currence]
They say I am an Urban Myth
They say black men don’t exist
Prove them wrong won’t you marry me, marry me!
And they say I’m nothing but a stat on a sheet
But here I am on my bended knees
Prove them wrong won’t you marry me, marry me!
So I’m asking every woman and girl
All over the world, if you wanna get married, you can marry me
I know you’ve been hurt, so let me be the one who puts you first
If you want to get married, you can marry me
Marry me

[Verse 2: David Banner]
I know you been stressing
I ain’t tripping on the next man, girl
You want a ring on your left hand
I’m groomed to be the groom and the best man girl!
Baby you can take my name and I can take the place
I can lift the veil I can kiss your face
We can jump the broom, take a leap of faith
After we tie the knot we can cut the cake
Tell your pops, say it’s okay to give me your hand and gone give you away, girl!

[Outro: Rudy Currence]
They say I am an Urban Myth
They say black men don’t exist
Prove them wrong won’t you marry me, marry me!
They say I am an Urban Myth
They say black men don’t exist
Prove them wrong, baby marry me, marry me!
