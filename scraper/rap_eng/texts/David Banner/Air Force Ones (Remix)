(I said) give me two pair
('Cause) I need two pair
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
(Big boy) stompin' in my Air Force Ones

Nelly:
I like the all-white, high-top, strapped with the gum bottom
There's somethin' about 'em, they're dirty, that's why I got 'em
I leave them strapped and laced, they come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em, I damn near shot 'em

Kyjuan:
Now if you look and see lime green Forces, it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop, my niggas flip-flop
Yeah my Force Ones in tip-top now form a flip-flops

Ali:
I like the limited edition, the khaki, and army green
Patent leather, pin stripes, you should see how I do the strings
Size 12 with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depends on when and where I'm at

Murphy Lee:
Don't get me wrong, man: Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
'Cause if the shoe is on the shelf you should have some, man
You cannot sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You might not have three or four but you got one, man

Murphy Lee:
We up in Foot Locker, I'm looking like I need those
10 1/2, and if you got 'em, give me two of those
I can tell she's never seen Murphy Lee befo'
'Cause she just standin' there as if I'm shootin' free throws
I said, "Excuse me, miss, I only wanna buy shoes"
She said, "I love you, Murph, especially in the white and blue"
I said, "The white and blue? Sounds nice, make it twice"
Then I signed an autograph, "Thanks for the advice"

Ali:
Yo, I keep it real dirty, dirty, you know how I do
Purple and gold with the Lakers, the Broncos, the orange and blue
I like floppy with ankle socks, lows, mids, and high-tops
With the clear sole but it's Tims and fat laces when is cold
But when the winter go (brr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all-purpose with them lil' dots in the toe
Ain't nothin' stoppin' this dough that I'm spendin' fo sho'
On them Nike Air Force N-E behind the O

Kyjuan:
Ok, Lee, I treat my shoes like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces and the wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh with electric roof
Plus I put a kit on the sole, now I got a wider shoe (ooh)
You see that low misk with the purple coop, I'm driving them
(Kyjuan where you getting them colors, are you dyein' them?)
10 is my size in them, and no point in tyin' them
Ain't no point of trying these on, they know I'm buying them

Nelly:
Now, don't nothing get the hype on first sight like white on whites
Them 3 quarters, the lows, they all tight
The only problem, they only good for one night
'Cause once you scuff 'em, you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis, the looks on store owners' faces
This kid is outrageous, he buying 'em by the cases
'Cause once I cop 'em, I gut 'em and switch the laces
They all-purpose ya heard me kinda like my Dayton's

Kyjuan:
I wore spurs at first, now there's tape on 'em
(Damn, when those come out?) So I write the date on 'em
These Louis Vuitton Ones, you gotta wait on 'em
I had to get them early so I spent mo' cake on 'em

Murphy Lee:
Look, I'm trying to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki, two head bands
Jewelry and all (you wilin') fish bowl in the mall
(I got some 15's) security buying shoes and all

Nelly:
Listen, sometimes I get 'em free and sometimes I gotta pay
Walk in the mall, and they know what I'm 'bout say
Gimme the black, and the platinum, and leather gray
The ones in the back and the pair you got on display

Ali:
Now, in the boxes is where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should keep buyin' (keep buyin'), once or twice but never 3 times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love Pumas and shell-toes
But can't nothing compare to a fresh, cripsy white pair of that
