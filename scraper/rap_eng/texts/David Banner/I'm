[Hook:]
You look like a bitch gotcha face all bent up
I like a pimp got my gators and my pimp cup
You take orders and run errands
I take vacations with killers and four time felons
You outside on line like where the weed
I'm inside getting high V.I.P stats
You where the rats and the D's at
I'm where the B's and the C's and the real O.G's at

[Verse 1:]
Ayo the girl spits harder than most dudes
I give it to you on any given sunday like soul food
I ain't even gotta double my vocals
I do a main, ad-libs and the rest is Pro Tools
I'm in the booth wit no shoes and my chain be bangin the mic so I don't got on no jewels
I'm so hot and I done told you
You ain't no kin to me so basically I don't know you
You don't know me homie I clap you with yo heat
If this was an L.A
I'd be a mother fucking OG
Set off the sirens form thee alliance
Its a four alarm blaze and I'm on fire
I was talking to Kanye and I heard through the wire
That I'm the truth and you're a liar
I'm the queen of rap and there is none higher and all you slut bag whores should call me sire

[Hook 1X]

[Verse 2:]
I'm like fuck that this is it
All these other chicks is wack and I'm the shit
See I'm from New York so I repped the Knicks
I'mma I'mma Husslin I could get them bricks
They say my flow is crazy and I could spit and I rap as if I had a dick
Bitches is bad but I'm that bitch
Listen I'm so above the average
Now my walk is mean but my whip is sick
I can't stand a clown but I love a trick
I see a group of dudes and I take my pick
Like you you and you with the Timbs hi nice to meet you my name is Rem
I don't drive a caddy but I'm stuntin like a pimp struct
With a diddy bop looking something like a limp
I cleaned up my money now I'm filthy fucking rich (shit)

[Hook 1X]

[Verse 3:]
See I'm from where niggas stash packs in the backs of their ball sack and pump crack, yak, D, weed and that
Put more baking soda in there coke to get more back
Roc Timberlands uptowns White Tees and sports hats
We kill all rats tell lies cheat and steal
Tints pitch black even gotta em on the windsheild
Liscense suspended Vehicles rented
Warrants open cases several offenses
No phone no cable notices of eviction
Parents is addicted kids don't listen
No rules no school no food in the kitchen and the staircase and elevator smell like piss
You can only talk tough if you do tough things
If you ain't from around here you better tuck them blings
Only difference between me and you is that I got out the hood but the hood is still in me

[Hook 1X]
