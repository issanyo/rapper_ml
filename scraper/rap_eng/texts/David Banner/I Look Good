[Verse 1: ?]
Y’all know I keep big dickin’ these hoes
They tickle me so bad I think about twit pickin’ these hoes
Plus I look good, plus I told my mama
That after she left her baby so she ain’t shouts out to my comers
Behead them bad bitches, I’m used to that
When I should respect, I am, this is no booty play
I-I-I got there soft, white baby on me
That’s why they call me 50 Cent has played a Shorty
And I can’t even lie, you know I’m the truth
I mean that and she credit for because it’s cute

[Verse 2: Savvy]
I look good though, magnificent
Catch you in the mix, hopin’ we can be intimate
I’mma dib and dill, hoe smilin’ from ear to ear
Savvy been a playa, I kill the swag throw me the chair
I’m too cute, ballin’ baby we huge
We can make a movie but right now I need a preview
My rockin’ Ribatta jeans got number my self esteem
Just look in the mirror
Just look, ain’t that nigga clean?
If I want it I grab it
I bribe, I wear it
Head over heel with them horses

I leave them bitches exstatic and they see me attractive
I live my life like a pimp, you might see me with glasses

[Verse 3: David Banner]
Now I’m comin’ back from Paris
I’m shoppin’ liftin’ so lavish
My wheel sittin’ on Ferris
Uh what you girlfriend girlfriend talk about?
I fuck her ‘til she beats then I walk her out
I never had to put ‘em in the parking lot
I lay like that better park a lot
Show dudes, show you what’s coming out next year
What’s coming in the future
When I say your bitch I know I’m pointin’ in the future
Yea nigga cute, act so bitch, umm what to do?
Aks your friend, I fucked her too
That thing nigga, I don’t fuck with you
Uh, I don’t think it, bitch, I know it
My self-esteem’s on bricks, I let my ego fuckin’ tow it
I don’t talk about money, I let my wardrobe show it
If your closet tells a story then mine shits a stork nigga
