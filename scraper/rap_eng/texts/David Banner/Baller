[David] Ha hahaha! I ain't gotta say much... $hort, YEAH!
[$hort] So you wanna be a baller?
[David] David Banner~! Big Face
[$hort] You wanna get paid?

[Too $hort]
You gotta keep tryin, just don't give up
Can't get on your feet cause you just won't get up
You dream about havin nice things but you don't have a plan
How you gon' get it, from your Uncle Sam?
Your welfare check can't buy a house and a Benz
What'chu wanna be, a mouse or a man?
You need a hustle, somethin that'll make some cash
Don't step on the gas, you're goin way too fast
In your new sports car, you're dreamin again!
Snap out of it - I know you're fiendin to win
You need to start from the beginnin, get a paper and pen
What'chu like to do, what's your favorite thing?
There's gotta be somethin you can do wit'cha life
Sell things that a whole bunch of people will buy
Make a lot of profits, make bank deposits
Wanna live like this, here's a shoe, how's it fit?

[Hook: Too $hort] + (Banner)
How you gon' ball if you got no hustle
How you gon' pimp if you got no game (YEAH!)
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle
Your life ain't right cause you so damn lame (YEAH!)
Now how you gon' ball if you got no hustle
How you gon' pimp if you got no game (YEAH!)
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle
Your life ain't right cause you so damn lame (YEAH!)

[David Banner]
Niggas wanna play with they life but won't play with they kids
They'll ball for these hoes but won't invest shit
Go to church and pray to blue eyes, church is for them pew thighs
Supersized by fries, I pimp a lot of bitches
But I'd rather save yo' lives
I'm from a place where they hung black folks
Where a bird can be whipped from some raw AND dope
Now you broke cause you smoke and you don't got a job
Man get up off yo' ass and do just like Todd~!
Sell yo' shit up out the trunk
Stop hatin other niggas you can get what you want
You can get what you need without makin others bleed
I'm the master of the P-U-S-S-E
Oops I meant Y, others gotta die
Just to help sorry-ass lames get by
Now you'll let a bird die if you saw a bush
But you're pussy in the hood nigga, come get douched
Yeah nigga!

[Too $hort]
When you finally start makin some dough
You gotta work a lot harder, way more than befo'
It ain't hard to get in, but it's hard to stay
When you start pimpin it's all night all day
Non-stop, gettin it, then you start kickin it
Out with some hoes, later on you'll be stickin it
Move forward and continue to do what men do
Gettin money cause it's in you

[David Banner]
Or maybe bein a man ain't in you, you BITCH
You can sell out your own just so you can get rich
No soul, no vibe, but you sportin a cross
Man the truth is you're tired and your spirit is lost!
I've been baptized in dirt, pull your panties up nigga
Rather shoot ya in your mind instead of blowin out your liver
David Banner, Mississippi until the day that I die
You can make it in this world, stand up nigga try

[Hook]
