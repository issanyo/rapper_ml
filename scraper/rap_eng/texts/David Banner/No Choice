[Hook: J Doe]
I got no trouble to be fresh, no choice but to be fresh
I got no choice but to be fresh, no choice but to be fresh
Bitch my closet full, bitch-bitch-bitch my closet full
Bitch my closet full, bitch-bitch-bitch my closet full
I got no choice but to be fresh, no choice but to be fresh
I got no choice but to be fresh, no choice but to be fresh
Bitch my closet full, bitch-bitch-bitch my closet full
Bitch my closet full, bitch-bitch-bitch my closet full

[Verse 1: David Banner]
I feel just like Tim Tebow, blessed to be so fresh
I bought a pair of Gucci socks, your bitch she bought the rest
I had a hundred thousand on me, didn’t spend a dime
If I want it then it’s mine, your bitch put it on the credit line
Lyin’ lyin’ (Nigga I ain’t lyin’)
All this shit I’m buyin’ keeps a motherfucker flyin’
I just let it on that island, that home I’m on that pilin’
Boy I’m sittin’ on some diamonds, wipe my ass with seven thousand

[Hook]

[Verse 2: J Doe]
I wake up and I scream, thank God that I’m blessed
Open up my closet, no trouble to be fresh
Bitch my closet full, shoes on shoes on shoes
Don’t compare our wardrobes, I give ya'll boys the blues
Dollars in my pocket, want it then I cop it
I walk up to foreign car, I took my top and dropped it
On my way to Paris, that’s where I do my shoppin’
Parle vous francais, bitch my French is poppin’

[Hook]

[Verse 3: David Banner]
These nigga's be all on my money
They ain’t go no money
Bitches broke, she need money brig
She ain’t gettin' none from me

[J Doe]
I got the shit that you dream about
I drop a thousand, don’t think about it
I’m fly boy, don’t need a pilot
I fashion high, don’t need a stylist

[David Banner & J Doe]
Louie got it, Gucci got it
I’m past that shit, you still talk about it
I wreck my bentley and walk up out it
You need a cab, I need a pilot

[J-Doe]
My kicks is exclusive
But what I do to these niggas is abusive
And I’m the best when it comes to this music
And when they ask me why I do it

[Hook]
