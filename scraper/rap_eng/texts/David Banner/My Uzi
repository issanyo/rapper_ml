[Chorus: UGK samples]
My uzi weigh a ton
I bought a
My uzi weigh a ton
I bought a
Ain't got no bodyguard
I just need mighty God
Ain't got no bodyguard
I just need mighty God
My uzi weigh a ton
I bought a
My uzi weigh a ton
I bought a
Ain't got no bodyguard
I just need mighty God
Ain't got no bodyguard
I just need mighty God

[Verse 1: David Banner]
I swear on Mama Lena soul
My grand mama, that old code
That Mississippi, that dirt road
This barefoot, that bare soul
I bare the load oh
Solo, by myself
Dolo, Frodo from uh
Lord of The Rings
So I guess I have to bare it alone
My precious won’t leave me
I don’t need platinum, I don’t need gold
All I need is an Uzi and a clip to load
This one mic this Jordan flow
Trying not to wear Jordan’s Clothes
These kids are dying, Jordan knows
Nike too, Vanport
Portland, they blew it up
Black commerce, they chewed it up
Chewed it up, spit it out
That’s the kind of shit I’m trying to spit about
Lash Laws, pile of tricks
Politics is a pile of shit
I am getting real close, now I’m smelling it, I’m inhaling it
(Inhaling it, Inhaling it)

[Chorus]
My uzi
My Uzi
(You LIED)
My uzi (I’m smelling it)
My Uzi (you lied)
My uzi weigh a ton
I bought a
My uzi weigh a ton
I bought a
Ain't got no body guard
I just need mighty God
Ain't got no body guard
I just need mighty God

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Uh! My Uzi weigh a ton
Pray to God I stay protected
High alert, I see jackers on the creep in my reflection
Lord, ain’t nothing been promised lately
Police out here acting crazy
Shooting up black folks left and right
People out here die every night
Mama worried about me all the time because I’m grinding
Trying to make a move because the government don’t give a fuck about poor folk
Out here paying dues trying keep the food on my table
My family fed and my mind right
And an attitude adjuster just in case a motherfucker wanna take my limelight
I got a hundred round drum, if you’re talking about rope around here
Or that KKK shit make it where your Klan can’t come down here
Partner, fuck that
I’ve been on one since they killed Mike
And the jury hollering not guilty
Folk, I put my faith in God because that’s all I know
And this Uzi

[Chorus]
My Uzi weigh a ton I bought a
(I got a hundred round drum)
My Uzi weigh a ton I bought a
(where the Klan can’t come down here)
My Uzi, My Uzi
I’ve been on one since they killed Mike
And the jury hollering not guilty
Folk, I put my faith in God because that’s all I know
And this Uzi

[Verse 3: David Banner]
And my shoulder hold a AK that holds enough shots
To let enough cops know that I ain't going out without a fight
This city will be burned down by the night
Yeah I be Raven about Baltimore, talking about taking shit out of the store
My desert eagle, my people protector, you step in my sector you’ve got to go
BOOM BOOM BOOM
Pick him up off the floor pig, it's you or its me
This is for the black skin so what's happening?
Homie fuck what you see on TV
You’re going to see, they say this shit is about black and white
All this shit is pretty Freddie Gray
Swings and see-saws - rusty in the Sipp
Trust me, pimp, we don't never play
This is every day, I’m quite cheap
No nice cars, just nice beats
My little revolver, my problem solver
Put some red holes in them white sheets
And I might preach with this Glock 40
Respect mine with this tec-9
Gave my old lady a little 380 but it jams easy, let me check mine

[Outro]
(my Uzi weigh a ton)
Heavy as all the shit that they done done UH!
(My Uzi weigh a ton)
And I’m going to tote this shit until I'm done (my Uzi)
I’m on the run and I can't sleep
(my Uzi)
My food poison, i can't eat
(my Uzi)
I can't break, I ain't fake
(my Uzi)
My breath is something that you cannot take
(my Uzi weigh a ton)
Heavy as all the shit that they done done UH!
(My Uzi weigh a ton)
And I’m going to tote this shit until I'm done (my Uzi)
I’m on the run and I can't sleep
(my Uzi)
My food poison, i can't eat
(my Uzi)
I can't break, I ain't fake
(my Uzi)
My breath is something that you cannot take
My uzi weigh a ton
I bought a
My uzi
My uzi
My uzi
My uzi
