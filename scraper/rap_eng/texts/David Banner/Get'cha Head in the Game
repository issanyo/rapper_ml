Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Coach said to fake right and break left
Watch out for the pick and keep ya' eye on the defense
Gotta run the give and go, take the ball on the hole
But don't be afraid, just shoot the outside, j
Just keep ya' head in the game
Just keep ya' head in the game
Don't be afraid, just shoot the outside, j
Just keep ya' head in the game
You gotta get'cha head in the game
You gotta get it, gotta get it, get'cha head in the game
You gotta get'cha, get'cha head in the game
You gotta get it, gotta get it, get'cha head in the game
Come on!
Gotta get'cha head in the game
You gotta get it, gotta get it, get'cha head in the game
You gotta get'cha, get'cha head in the game
You gotta get it, gotta get it, get'cha head in the game
Let's make sure that we get the rebound
'Cause when we get it, then the crowd will go wild
A second chance, gotta grab it and go
Maybe next time we'll hit the right notes...
Wait a minute!
Not the time or place
Wait a minute!
Got my head in the game
Wait a minute!
Get'cha head in the game
Get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game!
I gotta, I gotta, get my head in the game
You gotta get it, gotta get it, get'cha head in the game
I gotta, I gotta, get my head in the game
You gotta get it, gotta get it, get'cha head in the game
I gotta, I gotta, get my head in the game
You gotta get it, gotta get it, get'cha head in the game
I gotta get my, get my head in the game
You gotta get it, gotta get it, get'cha head in the game
Why am I feeling so wrong...?
My head's in the game
But my heart's on the song
He makes me feel so right...
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
You gotta get it, get it...
