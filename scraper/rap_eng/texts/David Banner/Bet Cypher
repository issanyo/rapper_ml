My dream is to be part of team Elohim
To transcend sin, the wonts of human beings
To meditate then convo with all eye seeing
Or maybe just hear
Quiet my soul so he, she, or it can lighten my load
My soul corrodes
To mouth is a commode
Defecate some shit that y'all should hear
I'm susceptible to depression but then I think about Shakir Stewart
I need help from the Almighty
To ask why we don't discuss the trials of Chris Lighty
From Ku Klux the Klan who tied Emmett Till to a fan
The same that shot Tray, Zimmerman and
They got my stomach in knot
I'm bent over praying to God like its salat, its a lot
Ankles tied to some chains
I want to say yes but its no like Tulane
I meant N.O
Not many blacks make it to the show Jay Leno
Went broke in a Bentley now i'm rich whippin' a Pinto;
I'm stuntin' like deep dish rims on Hertz rentals
When I was broke I'd be proud to sell dope to your own folks house, nigga
I meant it how it sounds
Where were all the white rappers when they mowed Mike Brown down
No where to be found
