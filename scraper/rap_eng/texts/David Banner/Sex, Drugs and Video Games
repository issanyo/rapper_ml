[Verse 1]
Look me in my eyes girl and say I never loved you
Pass God and mother, girl, I put nothin’ above you
If my wife existed then I really thought she was you
The way your friends talk shit they might as well be fuckin’ you
I’d be lyin’ if I said there wasn’t no pussy on the side
I’m alone in L.A., I was just tryna get by
I gave you all I had, but my soul and my manhood
You got selfish, now I’m thinkin’ that you want that too
Under the spell of these witches
Don’t die broke and lonely, fuckin’ with them better bitches
They say I’m from the sin but they ain’t got no men
Regardless of my fallacies, you and I were friends
Ha, I guess your mother got her wish
That I would leave while her daughters feelin’ like shit
I won’t call no names but if it’s all the same
Your mother and your friends control my video game (damn!)
Damn, I missed callin’ your name
I guess the sex and the drugs control my video games

[Hook]
Sex, drugs, and video games
But the controller is connected to our brain
They’re playin’ with the pain
But I think I’d rather die than be on TV tryna live a fuckin’ lie
Sex, drugs, and video games
But the controller is connected to our brain
They’re playin’ with the pain
But I think I’d rather die than be on TV tryna live a fuckin’ lie

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I get high; but shit I can't escape
Rappers say they ballin’ but these niggas getting raped
How I know? Cuz, I got it all on tape, you could view it all it ain’t
Niggas publicizing hate, like it’s Common versus Drake
Yea our soul is controlled by the music that we make
When I die I wanna be known for more than just play
Let me say; that I’m a tad bit embarrassed
That white folks think it’s cool that these niggas off in Paris
But to Africa, a childs say, Banner now its on
I’m a nigga ‘til I die cuz I heard it in your song
Real hoes get down on the floor. How I know?
Cuz I bought your fuckin’ CD and that picture told me so
Then I ask little buddy could I ever change his mind?
On the dime he said "yea, if you can stop my folks from dyin’"
Huh... could I ever change his mind?
He said "yea David Banner, if you could stop my folks from dyin’"
And that’s real. Cuz young niggas get killed

[Hook]
Sex, drugs, and video games
But the controller is connected to our brain
They’re playin’ with the pain
But I think I’d rather die than be on TV tryna live a fuckin’ lie
Sex, drugs, and video games
But the controller is connected to our brain
They’re playin’ with the pain
But I think I’d rather die than be on TV tryna live a fuckin’ lie
