[Verse 1 : Sylvan LaCue]
You could be anything you wanna be
You could be anything you wanna be
You could be anything you wanna be
Just know what you wanted and take what you need
[?] and love what you see
Hate on a character not what it breeds
Some things will not be quite what it seems
Hold on to family fight for your team
I know some niggas they stuck in the system
Lord I pray for you nobody was with us
Teachers went missing their fathers went missing
Moma told lessons that we never listen
So much around us that lead us to pain
They gave us our medicine just as it came
Knocked in South Florida and set with the blame
Niggas got life tryna feed mommas ,daughters and brothers and sisters and children of theirs
I feel your struggle dawg nothing compares
My nigga Rambo got 2 to his hearth
I would die for a future that gives him a air
Thug holidays
[?] undisputed he kept us together through passion and music
For that or forever will pay my respects
He gave us a pass let's fuck up the rest
My gradmoma died I dropped out my plans
I hopped from the first flight , I knew that I could
Came back from a city of brilliant minds
But nowhere to fundle their hearths trough the woods
Niggas were mourning with chains on out necks
We saw the traps and avoided the treats
I think the time we get back to us next
I think the time we get back to us next

[Verse 2: Jeff Rambo]
See pain got me here
Let me make that shit clear
I know death is near but still I never shed a tear
In just one year I lost my sister and a couple peers
One to the struggle one to drugs, man the end is near
This love got me like fuck love give 'em fear
So now I'm laying these bars that's running though your ears
Aiming straight for the  stars and never switching gears
Is Rambo bitch, struggle first up in here

[Verse 3: Philo B]
I might've had bad attendance but I never have bad intentions, you know
And when my people needed me the most I dropped everything
Yet the guild of not being there in the first is enough to make you think
Like what's more important than a fam
Every move we make is for the greater good of our people
But how much grind is too much
How do I maintain the balance
How these situations make you think that what's at stake is always bigger than you... is for the family
