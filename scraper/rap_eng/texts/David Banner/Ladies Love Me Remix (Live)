Ready to bounce another one off your chin
Every ounce I be pouncing cause of my adrenaline
Now it's out in the open. I won't say it again
I'm a Tennessee enemy. How I flow, I don't make friends
Keeping them in check and what I say will break they necks
Because, to me, they be just specks. And they bells got rung
You think you're rapping but you're not. I eliminate the lot
I got a flow so hot, sometimes I burn my tongue
I'm a straight swag soldier. Fitted cap my armor
Wherever I roam, girls blow up my phone like they suicide bombers
Carry my hood on my shoulder like a backpack
Old-school gentleman swag like the Rat Pack
Tell me don't go there? I went and came back
Likely to mack. Want proof?
I detailed my rides cause I knew I was having your chick in my car
I want the Phantom with the moon roof so she could reach up and grab the stars
You think you unlike the rest. You are not the best cause the best I are
I'm gonna drink her beauty in like it's an open bar
I love the ladies. And they love the coupe
So many girls' names in my phone contacts, that's alphabet soup
You be making fun of me, there's no one else in front of me
Not faking it, I'm making it do what it do
You had a nightmare about a guy like me taking your girl
So I guess I'm a dream come true
I treat 'em right. They on a first class flight
When I give her the diamond I love the look in her eyes
I got the Rolex on a jet so I guess time flies
