[Intro]
David Banner on the beat, bitch
I got a, I got a, I got a, I got a sweet tooth
I got a sweet tooth, I got a sweet tooth, I got a sweet tooth
Now can I eat goo, now can I eat you? Mmm

[Verse 1]
I gotta taste for you, now what you wanna do?
Girl, you cold, let me suck out your flu
Girl, you cold, girl, you cool
You heard of Salt N' Pepa? Well girl, you food
Girl, you hot like a bowl of hot stew
And I just stood over ma stew and just blew
And when there's no more of you, in the soup
I remove ma spoon and drink your juice
If you want to do me, do what cha wanna do
If my job is to blow, you can bet she blue
Mic check 1, 2, how about 1, 2
P-L-A-Y because I don't have a clue
But when I find out, I'm a show and tell you
When I lift my top lip, I could still smell you
When I swallow ma spit, I could still taste you
Put that pussy in ma face every time I face you
It goes P-U-S-S-Y
Because it's the reason I am alive
Momma, I need it to stay alive
It's like I gotta eat it just to survive

[Hook]

And you gotta feed me

Now can I eat you? Can I eat you?

[Verse 2]
Now let me get back to her
She call me Dracula, and I'll vacuum her
Catfish, dat fish, dat cat, tuna
I'll smack it up flip it like a spatula
Lil' Chris said 'Run It' and I tackled ya
Baby, can I be the worm in ya apple butt?
Now go back in her, and if you backin' up
I'll suck the front of dat pussy from da back of ya
I'm an urban legend like a black Acura
My taste buds set on a black actress
(Actress) I told her act-shun

And I hope she make me eat ma word cause my words is
Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy
