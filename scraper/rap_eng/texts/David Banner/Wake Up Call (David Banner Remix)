[Intro: Female Vocial]
David-David-David-David-David-David
David Banner, nigga

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I didn't hear what you were sayin'
I live on raw emotion baby
I answer questions, never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to say we
Never would have made it babe

[Pre-Hook: Adam Levine]
If you needed love, well then ask for love
Could have given love, now I’m taking love
And it’s not my fault cause you both deserve
What's coming now so don’t say a word

[Hook: Adam Levine]
Wake up call Caught you in the morning
With another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
She care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall came without a warning
So I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here? I don't think so

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I find you sleeping soundly
And your lovers screaming loudly
Hear a sound and hit the ground

[Pre-Hook: Adam Levine]

[Hook: Adam Levine]

[Verse 3: David Banner]
I couldn't disrespect the crib, you brought a man where I live
Now my pistol pointed, tryin' to leave led in his ribs
What's in something that I did, what's it time I did the spin
When I think about him, I think time you crack a rib
Call a preacher at the corner, it all when wrong
David Banner, Maroon 5. This is bigger then the song, dawg
Yeah! Uh!

[Hook: Adam Levine]

[Outro: Adam Levine]
I don’t feel so bad (Wake up call)
I don’t feel so bad (Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed)
I don’t feel so bad (Don’t you care about me anymore?)
Care about me? I don’t feel so bad
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
She care about me? I don't think so
