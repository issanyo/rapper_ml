[Intro: Dave Chapelle]
Who the fuck is that?
Yeah, bitch, it's me, it's me
So humble, I'm so humble

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ay, tell me what you gon' see looking back at yo' life
Won't be worth a damn, if you ain't living it right
All we know is stripes, learned to die for respect
You make a lot of money, they admirin' that
We gettin' bags here, playa, it just is what is is
Fall, flay, do or die, kill or be killed
Remember, walking Bankhead was a terrible thought
Intensions ain't work, tryna come up now
I'm prayin' God blessed me and this life I chose
'Cause the new Benz dropped, can't be ridin' the old ones
In 12 hours, I done raised hell and shit
Middle of the crack era, tryna sell and shit
In Vegas, fightin' police, me and Jeezy and 'em
Hit the strip, Fat Burger, did my thing again
All I do is kick back, blow gas and smile
Reminiscin' 'bout when I was young and wild
You're still feeling the effects of the shit we did
Before us, drug dealers didn't get this big
Where I'm from, it ain't glamorous, quite the different outcome
You have a run, get indicted, then forget about him
So much greatness but not so many make it, wonder how come?
It's been that way since Huey Newton, Martin, Malcolm
I got a grind and a hustle, I ain't hearing it
Plus a 1 of 1 drip that my daddy had

[Chorus: T.I.]
Ay, tell me what you gon' see when you looking back at yo' life
Ay, tell me what you gon' see when you looking back at yo' life
Looking back at yo' life
Ay, tell me what you gon' see when you looking back at yo' life
Looking back at yo' life
Ay, tell me what you gon' see when you looking back at yo' life
Looking back at yo' life

[Verse 2: T.I.]
On the front line facin' off with the L.A.P.D
Only nigga ain't a gang member is me
I'm certified through and through, ain't nothin' flawed 'bout that
The nigga was talkin' shit in Houston, went and saw 'bout that
In Cincy, caught me slippin', lost my homeboy 'bout that
Some bystander died after but never quite got back
I heard they caught 'em, I'm thinkin', 'We could pay the bond, I bet'
And then wait, 'Am I a maniac for thinkin' of that?'
Listen, my freedom on the line, I'ma square up and cap
But nigga lyin', talkin' 'bout I told, he really chillin' with a rat though
We through Paperwork party, show mine on a yard
And gym park; coached ball, taught a class and all
With the only one from Georgia gettin' regular visits
Filled up a couple busses so my people could kick it
Really did that, how the fuck you live with yourself?
Knowin' the only thing you ever did, you did it for self

[Chorus: T.I.]
Ay, tell me what you gon' see when you looking back at yo' life
Ay, tell me what you gon' see when you looking back at yo' life
Looking back at yo' life
Ay, tell me what you gon' see when you looking back at yo' life
Looking back at yo' life
Ay, tell me what you gon' see when you looking back at yo' life
Looking back at yo' life

[Outro: Dave Chappelle]
Everything I say, is the truth. And that's a lie. And that's the motha fuckin' truth
