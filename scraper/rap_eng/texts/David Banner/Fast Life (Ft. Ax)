Got me living that fast life
I think a nigga need to slow it down
Stack my paper, get in and out
Niggas know what I am talking about, yeah
Oh, might take your golds
Oh, might take your shit
Leave me your dope and your girl
Might pimp on that bitch
Got a tech and I'm sprayin'
Look man, huh, I'm just sayin'
'Cuz I'm smiling and bustin'
Y'all bitches think that I'm playin'
From the home of the trill
Cadillac and wood wheel
Bodies dropping when I'm poppin' up in your grill
Give a shit how you feel
Bitch I'm cockin' to buck
We could fight or just bust off these slugs
I could give a fuck, yeah
Got me living that fast life
I think a nigga need to slow it down
Stack my paper, get in and out
Niggas know what I am talking about, yeah
High gone off that dro
Bitch nigga what you know
So sick of being po' and tired
Tired then po'
So get on the flo'
Hoe, give me your dough
Oh, catch the blow
From this uh forty-fo'
Me I be so trill
In this Coupe Deville
Tryin' to stack up a mill
Before I get killed
Boys snortin' them hills
Girls poppin' them pills
Trying to buy some love
In this world through dollar bills, yeah
Got me living that fast life
I think a nigga need to slow it down
Stack my paper, get in and out
Niggas know what I am talking about, yeah
Vibe to the beat
Bust a swisha sweet
Fill it up with dro
Nigga you know
What's about to take place in this smoked out atmosphere
Vibe to the beat
Bust a swisha sweet
Fill it up with dro

What's about to take place in this smoked out atmosphere
All my real niggas sing it loud
Smoke, smoke on
Get your swisha sweets nigga and
Smoke on, smoke on
