Try to come at these niggas that’s popular then we poppin' you don’t mess when I open you

Go hard in the paint and get in a zone
Taking the championship in the end and if I don’t win I’ll bust a shot at your dome
I’m sticking you up if your pockets is on
I put that on everything
I’m winning the championship if you give me the ball, letting my nuts hang
If it’s a J, then fuck it I’m shoot it all. You put up the records of those in the past, I’m fucking them up
