Snoop Dogg
Konvict Music, Akon and David Banner
If niggas wanna ride tonight
Best believe we bout to ride tonight yeah
Young money, cash money
I got a 9mm
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around we gon' make me reveal it ay
I got a 9mm
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around we gon' make me reveal it ay
Tool on deck, why would I lie?
Nigga you a pussy, hope ya got nine lives
I can hit a nigga with the nine, nine times
Country ass boy, country like LeAnne Rimes
Mississippi D-Banner and Lil' Weezyana
E'rybody got tools so you will need a hammer
I'm a pill poppin' animal, syrup sippin' nigga
I'm so high you couldn't reach me with a fuckin' antenna
You fuckin' with this man, you can be this man's dinner
The nine gimme brains but the AK add liver
The rapper is insane flowin' like a mad river
Make your ass quiver like you naked at winter
Holly grove honcho, hard time giver
I'm a shark in the water, you just Long John Silver
I got a girl, you wanna meet her?
Her name is 9mm
I got a 9mm
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it ay
I got a 9mm
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it ay
If I got nine slugs, nine bullets gon' fly
If I got a red beam, nine people gon' die
Nine mamas gon' cry, nine spirits in the sky
Nine preachers preachin' nine sermons, tellin' nine lies
'Cause each and every one of y'all nine niggas wasn't shit
I would have rather kept the nine rugers in the ruger clip
The index finger slipped, the nine let nine spit
I lick 'em all like eighteen tits on nine chicks
I'ma suicide risk, nine slits on each wrist
If I die nine times the next go-around's a bitch
And if I come back, I'll throw 99 shows
And shove nine inches of dick in 99 hoes
I got a 9mm
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it ay
I got a 9mm
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it ay
I'ma West coast original, black John Wayne
Nigga where we from we like to pop that thang
Bang, you better stop that man, fat mouth to Dogg
And I'ma pop-pop-bang
Pigs wanna bust me, hoes wanna suck me
Niggas wanna touch me, none of that, trust me
I'm too slick, too sly, never snitch, I let it ride
I set aside all my feelings when I'm killin' like a villain
Move quick like a cheetah, I'ma killa
I ain't here to lock up, I flash the heater
Then lock your whole block up
Dip-dop-deeter Banner turn the beat up
Illa-fo-reala my nilla dilla never caught
You niggas always actin' hard
I keep a 9mm in my waist and got two more in the car
Yeah you're all about to get it so quit it
Tryin' to conceal, you'll fuck around and make me reveal it
So killas kill it
I got a 9mm
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it ay
I got a 9mm
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it ay
