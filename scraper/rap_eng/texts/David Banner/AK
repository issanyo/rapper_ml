Got a bullet with my name on it
They're trying to blow my back out
They use my block for their target practice
Make me want to scream and shout
Forty days became forty nights
Grandma use to bow her head and pray
Sometimes I feel like Noah on that ark
With my finger on the AK, AK, AK

[Verse 1: David Banner]
I'm from the land of the K-K-K, where the AKs spray
Where your baby mama sell 30 Rock like Tina Fey eh
Where the cops blind to us dying, like Charles's first name Ray
Where the slaves were made, graves were filled
Where the trill still build, where the pills will make you feel a little better
But the pain won't go away, where my uncle used to say
"I stopped smoking crack", but then he went back relapsed
My whole family collapsed it hurts to talk about that
And when I go back my girl be like, "Baby what's the rush?"
I'm like, "Last time I checked, who gave a fuck about us?"
Mississippi 'til I die they put my body in dust
I wipe my ass with the rebel flag, ain't giving a fuck
I'ma stand for my land it's the place I'm from
Where your grandmammy was born but you're scared to come
I'ma stand for my land it's the place I'm from
Where your grandmammy was born but you're scared to come

Got a bullet with my name on it (bullet with my name on it)
Trying to blow my back out (yeah yeah)
They use my block for their target practice (it amaze me)
Make me want to scream and shout
Forty days became forty nights (forty nights forty days)
Grandma use to bow her head and pray (Lord)
Sometimes I feel like Noah on that ark
With my finger on the AK, AK, AK

[Verse 2: David Banner]
I'm from a place that ain't the average rat race, least not for the black race
American Dream some of these cats chase
Gotta fact face I mean face facts
Some of these white folks hate blacks just for trying to take back
What they hijacked way back trying to stay black
Put our fortune in the wheels like Sajak
Say black, you know where I stay at?
Marvin Gaye still blasting out my 8-Track
Got a stomach full of turkey necks and pork fat
That's a snack got a play back
In my head, infinite rewind
Children be crying, them pigs they be lying
See I see more crime than sunshine
Fuck one time, yeah I said it, "Fuck one time"
Let me say it two times because any justice we do find
Comes in due time, that's why I got me a new nine
My nig, I'm through trying cause all my crew dying
While they're eating steak and croutons and Grey Poupon
These pigs ain't fond of us
Especially when your skin got some pigment
Granny told me to find happiness but that's just a figment
If you stand like a man then they callin' you ignant
Is it naive on Christmas to call Santa a bigot
And I pray that you dig it suppose they bury me
But my child's grave I'ma dig it, I'm a slave cause they rigged it
I'ma stand like a man it's the place I'm from
Where your grandpappy was born but you're scared to come
I'ma stand like a man it's the place I'm from
Where your grandpappy was born but you're scared to come

[Hook: Raheem DeVaughn]
Got a bullet with my name on it (bullet with my name on it)
Trying to blow my back out (tryna blow my back out, blaow)
They use my block for their target practice (I don't know why)
Make me want to scream and shout
Forty days became forty nights
Grandma use to bow her head and pray
Sometimes I feel like Noah on that ark
With my finger on the AK, AK, AK (with my hand on my AK, AK, AK)
Got a bullet with my name on it (bullet with my name on it)
Trying to blow my back out (yeah tryna blow my back out)
Use my block for their target practice (kill my people for target practice)
Make me want to scream and shout (make me want to scream and shout)
Forty days became forty nights (forty days and forty nights)
Grandma use to bow her head and pray (grandma bowed her head and prayed)
Sometimes I feel like Noah on that ark (sometimes I feel like Noah)
With my finger on the AK, AK, AK (AK, AK)

[Outro: Big Rube]
I'm from a place where they hung us from peach trees and dogwoods
Now we hang on streets paved with enslaved souls still saying "It's all good"
The dirt is red and turned muddy from sweat, tears and blood
Of our great great grand parents so respect been earned for it
You best show it, cause those who don't are just mocking the very core
Of what our people stood, sat in, marched, laid down and died for
Laid down their lives for, all of us so let's discuss what we should feel pride for
When the last time you threatened the life of a white man
But look how quick we tell a brother we'll murk him right where he stand
Can't stand for the bullshit if I'm breathing a little bit
My AK with the full clip is the staff and I'm Moses
Parting the minds ocean with a prose swarm like locust
Erupt from the past mantle with a flow passed to dismantle
The damage that's been done 'fore a nigga was even born
So whether the buildings are real tall or the fields are real wide
The south's my real home so I'm speaking from real pride
As I stand cause I'm a man and this is the place I'm from
Our people suffered in this land and now ya'll scared to come
