[Intro]
I'm in the booth bruh, gimme, gimme five minutes

[Hook]
Pump your black fist, pump your black fist
Pump your black fist, pump your black fist
Pump your black fist, pump your black fist
Pump your black fist, pump your black fist

[Verse 1: David Banner]
These crackers got drones. They are flying their saucers
Keep your white jesus, don't pray to your crosses
They are burning our churches, K.R.I.T. pass me the UZI
I know how to work it; I know how to Squirt it
No Martin, No Luther, No King, No Marching No choirs don't sing
The same christian lovers that raped our GrandMothers and hung our GrandFathers from trees
They are enemies!
Blood on the leaves, blood on the streets, blood on our feet
I'm sick of walking, I'm sick of dogs getting sicced on us, I’m sick of barking
I'm sick of spitting written sentences listeners don't get
Don't get, don't get, don't get!
Because they got Chains on their brains and that is not a diss
Shout out to TIT!!!

[Hook]
Pump your black fist, pump your black fist
Pump your black fist, pump your black fist
Pump your black fist, pump your black fist
Pump your black fist, pump your black fist

[Verse 2: Tito Lopez]
I ain't African I'm Ethiopian
Put some royal seeds in her fallopian
You can hope I win (hoe) or hope I lose
Bitch long as we made it trill to HOPE again!
I hope I get into Heaven, I hope we forgiven
I hope Jesus far as I know look like "Ned the Wino" when I see Florida Evans
Them 7's outweighing them 6's
I'm staying religious, cause we stay in the trenches
And gotta play where they lynch us, done came to my senses
I bet them crackas never came through my fences
Ya burn up ya cross, and I'll burn up ya corpse
Then I turn and bang and do the same to the witness
Hang ‘em and dangle ‘em in the street looking up at his feet
So you never forget this we did this for Martin and Malcolm, even Mandela
Jimmie Lee Jackson and then Medgar Evers
For Clyde Kennard, hard labor slaving in the yard
For Huey, for Hampton, for Bobby we GODLY
For Jordan Davis we gon' play this, for Sandra Bland we gon' stand
I'm still out here stomping, for Janaya Thompson, from the Coast to Compton its LO...

[Hook]
Pump your black fist, pump your black fist
Pump your black fist, pump your black fist
Pump your black fist, pump your black fist
Pump your black fist, pump your black fist
