[Verse 1: Justina Valentine]
Two spaces up and I might just kiss him
Go and roll that dice
Queen frost 'em, cold bitch when I diss 'em
Come and melt my ice
Wait till you come and see
My sugar rain love, soo sweet
My gumdrop bombs are hard as hell
Vanilla, fudge, and caramel
I like them more, they want my treats
But my candy land is not for free

[Bridge: Justina Valentine]
They tryna get to my candy land
They tryna get to my candy land
They tryna get

[Hook: Justina Valentine]
Come and taste your mouth soo sweet
Bon appétit, they cannot compete
Sugar spread all over these streets
Mines has been three, these candy land treats
Come and taste your mouth soo sweet
Bon appétit, they cannot compete
Sugar spread all over these streets
Mines has been three, my candy land

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Ay, bon appétit to your candy
Ay, I got a sugar rush, give you some money
Ay I'm a two seater, make 'em start dancin'
Ay, in a two seater, make 'em all jealous
Ay, she the lil reason, make 'em all jealous
Ay turn the club up, keep the club rockin'
Ay, need the candy, girl it's Zoo Wap
Ay, keep the tub up, peoples ain't watchin'
I'm tyrant to your candy, babe
(Vanilla, fudge, and caramel)
To your candy, babe
I'm tyrant to your candy, babe
I hope you understand me, babe

[Bridge: Justina Valentine]
They tryna get to my candy land
They tryna get to my candy land
They tryna get

[Hook: Justina Valentine]
Come and taste your mouth soo sweet
Bon appétit, they cannot compete
Sugar spread all over these streets
Mines has been three, these candy land treats
Come and taste your mouth soo sweet
Bon appétit, they cannot compete
Sugar spread all over these streets
Mines has been three, my candy land

[Verse 3: Justina Valentine]
You wanna lick around my gumdrops, I'm already cravin'
Come taste my rainbow favor, amazing
Eat with your fingers, animal instinct
Tonight we dine, now take me and drape me
And you know I got the drops, I'mma hit 'em with the treats
Sugar on deck, so we sweeten up the streets
My baby is a hustler, always ready to flip
Gettin' to this money, like takin' candy from kids
Lickin' and lickin', come lick this candy on your face
Oh you wanna be my man?, Melt in your mouth, not your hand

[Hook: Justina Valentine]
Come and taste your mouth soo sweet
Bon appétit, they cannot compete
Sugar spread all over these streets
Mines has been three, these candy land treats
Come and taste your mouth soo sweet
Bon appétit, they cannot compete
Sugar spread all over these streets
Mines has been three, my candy land

[Outro: Justina Valentine]
You are soo sweet (my candy land)
You are soo sweet (my candy land)
