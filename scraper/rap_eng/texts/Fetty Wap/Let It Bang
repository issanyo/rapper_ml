You like hoppin' out on the Lex, ballin' out on my baby
Drop top Mercedes, what you want, my baby?
Fuck around with my baby, I go bang bang for my baby
Switch lanes with my baby, sip lean with my baby

Hit the mall with my baby, blow it all on my baby
You is just a stain to a nigga
And she gon' let it bang for a nigga
