[Intro]
Ayy, yeah, baby
Mmm, uh, uh

[Chorus]
My niggas stack their money just to spend it
'Cause when you die, you cannot take it with you
If you ain't beefin' 'bout the money, then what's the problem?
Don't worry about my niggas 'cause I got 'em, uh
My niggas stack their money just to spend it, uh
'Cause when you die you cannot take it with you
And if you ain't beefin' 'bout no money, then what's the problem? Uh
Don't worry about my niggas, ZooWap got 'em, uh

[Verse]
On everything, for 17 I'm wildin', ayy
Treat my whole squad on an island, ayy
Ziploc gang, bring a lighter, ayy
It's gon' be a house party on this island, ayy
Shit boom like M80s on this island
It's a lot of trillionaires throwin' dollars
Causin' pure hell, wildin' out on this island
I do this too swell, my pockets too swell
Come try the Hunned Gang, man they'll shoot ya
I do this for my squad, I do this for my gang
I do this for my squad, I do this for my gang
It's Zoovie from the trap and ain't a damn thing change

[Chorus]
My niggas stack their money just to spend it
'Cause when you die, you cannot take it with you
If you ain't beefin' 'bout the money, then what's the problem?
Don't worry about my niggas 'cause I got 'em, uh
My niggas stack their money just to spend it, uh
'Cause when you die you cannot take it with you
And if you ain't beefin' 'bout no money, then what's the problem? Uh
Don't worry about my niggas, ZooWap got 'em, uh
