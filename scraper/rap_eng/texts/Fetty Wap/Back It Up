[Hook: Monty]
My niggas about the cash
I'm driving something fast
Girl you got all that ass
What you gon' do with that?
Just turn 'round, back it up
That money I'm stacking up
Ain't worried bout these hoes
These bitches ain't bad as some
[x2]

[Verse 1: Monty]
Girl you got all that ass, what you gon' do with that?
I heard you tryna fuck, you know I'm cool with that
And you know you can catch me where the shootas at
Ain't worried bout these bitches bae, I'm thru with that
Think I [?]
Ridin' round gettin' colder
I'm just tryna see what you bout
Everywhere I go my Zoo's round
Ain't worried bout hoes
Blowin' all this weed smoke
And they know how we roll
Bad bitches, I keep those

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
My niggas about that cash, I'm driving something fast
200 all on my dash, watch how I hit the gas
I got red all on my seats, shit is lookin' bloody
Zoo, that my gang, fold gang lovin'
Monty up next, niggas upset
ZooGang, the squad love to flex
I said Monty up next, niggas upset
Niggas come for my broad, I'm at their neck
17 my squad, 17 my squad
Niggas know we go hard, niggas know we go hard
Try to come for my broad, I'm at your neck
I said Monty up next, niggas upset

[Hook]
