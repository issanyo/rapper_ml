[Intro: French Montana]
Sometimes I wonder, why my dogs going under

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Sometimes I wonder, ayy
How I keep on movin' on, ayy
I love the weed, blow the whole thing, ayy
You smell the loud, that's my cologne, yeah baby
Sometimes I wonder, ayy
Where these niggas goin' wrong, ayy
I'm a young ass nigga
But I could buy your bitch a home, yeah baby

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
I ball hard like a nigga hoopin' baby
Hear that engine, that's a fuckin' coupe baby, ayy
When I shoot all you hear is swoosh baby
ZooGang, Zoovie, I'm the truth baby wow

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Sometimes I wonder, ayy
How I keep on movin' on, ayy
I love the weed, blow the whole thing, ayy
You smell the loud, that's my cologne, yeah baby
Sometimes I wonder, ayy
Where these niggas goin' wrong, ayy
I'm a young ass nigga
But I could buy your bitch a home, yeah baby

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Pull up on the scene, shinnin'
Rubies on the chain cost a hunnid, them diamonds
We grindin', perfect timin'
I drive behind her, I bet they find her
Pull up with that red top BBs under, Stevie Wonder
I'm TVs under initials and no eatin' gumbo
Louis Vuitton, shawty fine
Talkin' to 'em pigs, we don't eat the swine
And sometimes I wonder
Why my dogs keep goin' under, hann
Montana!

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Sometimes I wonder, ayy
How I keep on movin' on, ayy
I love the weed, blow the whole thing, ayy
You smell the loud, that's my cologne, yeah baby
Sometimes I wonder, ayy
Where these niggas goin' wrong, ayy
I'm a young ass nigga
But I could buy your bitch a home, yeah baby
