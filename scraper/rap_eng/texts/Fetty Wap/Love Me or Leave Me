[Intro: Fetty Wap]
Yeah, baby
1738, oh
Zoovier
We can do whatever you like, now baby
Ayy, ayy
Let's do it over again, now baby
Ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: Teenear & (Fetty Wap)]
Stop that faking, laid back thinking
Tryna act real cold
Stop these whispers, we both know what
We came here to do, oh
Don't be thinking too much, babe
Tell me that you feel the same
Now it's just the two of us (woah)
If you want it, make it yours
This could be a work of art
Boy, you gotta play your part (ayy, ayy)

[Pre-Chorus: Teenear & (Fetty Wap)]
I don't wanna fall-all-all so hard
But if you wanna let you, hold my heart
Do what you wanna do
It's all up to you
So just love me or leave me now (woah)

[Chorus: Teenear & (Fetty Wap)]
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me now (ayy, ayy)
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me now (ayy, ayy)
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me now
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me now

[Verse 2: Teenear & (Fetty Wap)]
You got me so in the moment
I won't hesitate
Too much talking, show me something
Take my breath away, yeah (yeah, baby)
If you want it, make it yours
This could be a work of art
Boy, you gotta play your part (ayy, ayy)

[Pre-Chorus: Teenear & (Fetty Wap)]
I don't wanna fall-all-all so hard (so hard)
But if you wanna let you, hold my heart
Do what you wanna do
It's all up to you
So just love me or leave me now (love me or leave me)

[Chorus: Teenear & (Fetty Wap)]
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me now (ayy, ayy)
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me now (ayy, ayy)
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me now
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me now

[Bridge: Teenear]
Love me or leave me now
Love me or leave me now

[Chorus: Teenear]
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me now
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me now (leave me now)
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me now
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me now
