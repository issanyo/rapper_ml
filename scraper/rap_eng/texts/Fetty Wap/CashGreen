[Chorus: Monty]
Bitch, you know I'm all about this CashGreen
Every time she see me ridin', make her wanna get inside it
Ballin' like a muthafuckin' air fleet
Anything you see you got it, and we only make deposits
Get two of your girls, that's a tag team
Then just start the pussy poppin', I just wanna see you drop it
And she cook the work like a trap queen
She be lookin' like the hottest and she only 'bout them dollars

[Verse 1: Monty]
Red bottoms, Neiman Marcus, bend it over, she Miss Parker
Range Rove, Beamers, Porshes, they ain't know we some bosses
And I got that thing up in the car, hope you proceed with caution
Catch him when he sleepin', while he creepin', only three to off him
Got that choppa singin' money ringin', I can hear it callin'
Probably out in Phoenix, in the arena and the squad preformin'
Like my bitch conceited and she need it then you better park it
Never been defeated, got that nina, I ain't scared to spark it
Call me up to beat it, when I leave it, you gonna wanna park it
ZooGang that's who we is, when you see us
You know we some ballers
Remy by the liter, I might leave her and might never call her
Ain't fuckin' no skeeters, that's on Yeezy, whatcha got to offer?

[Chorus: Monty]
Bitch, you know I'm all about this CashGreen
Every time she see me ridin', make her wanna get inside it
Ballin' like a muthafuckin' air fleet
Anything you see you got it, and we only make deposits
Get two of your girls, that's a tag team
Then just start the pussy poppin', I just wanna see you drop it
And she cook the work like a trap queen
She be lookin' like the hottest and she only 'bout them dollars

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Zoovier, I run the Zoo and Monty Zoo the captain
Get 'em off for 32, you know we move that magic
Parked the Rari in the hood, you know I made it flashy, ayy
Most of these bitches ratchet if you ask me, ayy
Gettin' head in the Rari, now that's classic, ayy
If I ain't make that bitch nut then Monty smash it, ayy
And any bitch he ain't want then Monty pass it, ayy
Never beefed over bitches, boy that's ratchet, ayy
Swervin' Raris and the Lambos in the hood, nigga, ayy
Cheated off another, I'm with some hood nigga, ayy
Every time you see the Zoo, I'm in the hood, nigga, ayy
Run up on the Zoo, I wish you would, nigga WOW

[Chorus: Monty]
Bitch, you know I'm all about this CashGreen
Every time she see me ridin', make her wanna get inside it
Ballin' like a muthafuckin' air fleet
Anything you see you got it, and we only make deposits
Get two of your girls, that's a tag team
Then just start the pussy poppin', I just wanna see you drop it
And she cook the work like a trap queen
She be lookin' like the hottest and she only 'bout them dollars
