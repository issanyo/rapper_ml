[Intro]
There are demons all around me
Demons all around me
I keep money all around, all around, all around me

[Hook]
I got demons all around me, you can't fuck up my plan, yeah
I got demons all around me, telling me I'm the man
I keep money all around me, around me
Smoke the room up 'til it's cloudy, it's cloudy
I ain't do this for no clowns see, it was just for the fans

[Verse]
Zoovier!
Tell me, who can fuck with my flow, baby? On this beat I go crazy, oh
Pull up, pickin' up and roll, babe, this time we ain't wasted
I was tired of living in the basement, shot past niggas, it was crazy
Now everywhere that I go, baby, bitches screaming my name and
Niggas acting like lames and niggas ain't in my lane and
I'm sorry to all my fans who have been waiting
And I promise, I was never nothing like the rest, baby
Never tried I just flex, baby, and these other niggas swagging
Love it when I bring that cash in, baby, yeah
And hit her once and now she braggin', baby, yeah
And I'm the king, you better ask them, baby, yeah
And get into it, bring them bags in, baby, yeah
And seen you tryna fit that ass in, baby, yeah
And see a nigga, don't you pass him, baby, yeah
And if you want it you can have it now, baby, yeah
'cause I'm really in my bag now, baby
I'ma say what's on my mind, tell me what ain't mine, I'ma make it mine, baby
Tell me she ain't fine, shawty you a dime, I tell you all the time, baby
Tired of playing around, holding up my crown when I step outside, baby
Let's go round for round, or flow for flow, whatever you like, baby
Zoovie I'm the truth, i'ma keep it true and that's on my life, baby (yeah)
Ride and catch a flight, I'ma be alright, ain't nothing nice, baby (yeah)
Money on my jewels, money like a jew, I know how to save now
Please watch what you say, my boys won't play 'round, baby

[Outro]
They 'gon play, they 'gon play 'round, baby
