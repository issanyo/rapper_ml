You know I love a hood bitch, ponytail with a fat ass
If it smell good when I pass then I might smash
And if that bitch got her own and she don't need me
Only time she hit my phone when she tryna see me
Love a hood bitch, ponytail with a fat ass
If it smell good when I pass then I might smash
And if that bitch got her own and she don't need me
Only time she hit my phone when she tryna see me

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
I need a loyal ass bitch who don't be givin' a fuck
And if the police ran down she ain't givin' it up
I'm stuntin' with her in my coupe, never seen the roof, ay
Five thousand dollar shoes, I got none' to prove, ay
Swervin' on 'em in my set, you can see the jewels, ay
You either with us or against us, that's how niggas move, ay
PnB and Zoo Gang making niggas move, ay
Young niggas get to it, young niggas get cash
Every car I own got 200 on the dash
Every bitch that get PnB and Zoo them niggas smashed
Balmains and Margielas, we got bitches goin' crazy
I don't hang with new fellas, get the fuck out my Mercedes
Flames kill truth tellers, we been burnin' shit oblivious
Stay in my new Ferrari, too rich for niggas to blame me in
Turn up at every party, I'm all you been hearin' lately
Then we go do Bacardi and drink it without a chaser

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
You know I love a hood bitch, ponytail with a fat ass
If it smell good when I pass then I might smash
And if that bitch got her own and she don't need me
Only time she hit my phone when she tryna see me
Love a hood bitch, ponytail with a fat ass
If it smell good when I pass then I might smash
And if that bitch got her own and she don't need me
Only time she hit my phone when she tryna see me

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
I need a hood ass bitch from around the way
Ass fat, hella swag, with Kim Kardashian braids
Couple tats, couple piercings, I could picture us rolling
Take the work in her pussy and my pistol she holding
If she get her own chain she can be my main thing
And every time we take a picture she say gang gang gang
Swervin' in and out of lanes, I might let her wear my chain
We get high then we fuck, it's like we fuckin' on a plane
I need a bitch that can whip
Get the work, make it flip
Cocaine on the strip
The bitches tryna get rich
The bitches suck good dick
They can make me bust real quick
Need a bitch to count my cash
And help me run it in

And if that bitch got her own and she don't need me
