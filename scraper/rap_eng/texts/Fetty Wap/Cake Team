Check, 1738


[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
I'm like, she got cake for days
Got bands all on the plate
Baby girl, watch what you say
Put that cake in my face
I'm like she got cake though
Cake though, she got cake though
Look how it's moving, I'm swerving
Up in the corners, I'm getting to it
Bands though, I'm throwing bands though
I'm throwing mula
Touch mine, get your top popped
I'm a shooter
Beamer, with the top dropped
I'm a cruiser
Remy Boyz, that is my squad
It's a movement
Rob me? Nigga, haha
You're a loser
Your bitch got a fat ass
I'ma do her
Hulk smash, fuck her brains out
Knock the screws loose
Backwards, rolling backwards
I'm a guru
What I like, I'm Slick Rick
I'm a ruler
Rookie, on this rap shit, I can school you

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
She got cake for days
Got bands all on the plate
Baby girl, I'd love to stay
Baby girl, watch what you say
I'm like, she got cake for days
Got bands all on the plate
Baby girl, watch what you say
Put that cake in my face
I'm blowing out the candles

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Ay, twerk, twerk, twerk some bitch
Work, work, work some bitch
Let me see you get low and move something quick
Let me see you drop with it, do a little dip
And when the booty shorts on, she be looking thick
Ex nigga was lame, kept cumming quick
When I'm in, a track star, I'm gonna run this shit
I said, when I'm in, a track star, I'm gonna run this shit
Bitch, call me ZooWap, I'll be running shit
Bando, guap, all my money bitch
Stop playing, shake something, throwing money quick
Twerk with it, bounce with it, like you on the dick
If you're a big booty ho, start wobbling
If you're a big booty ho, start wobbling
RGF be the squad we be mobbing it
Remy Boyz like...

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
She got cake for days
Got bands all on the plate
Baby girl, I'd love to stay
Baby girl, watch what you say
I'm like, she got cake for days
Got bands all on the plate
Baby girl, watch what you say
Put that cake in my face
I'm blowing out the candles

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
Cake team twerk, thunder clap
Lightning bolt in the pussy, that's a thunder cat
And I ain't trying to throw no singles, where them honeys at?
And I don't want no dime bitch, where them hundreds at?

[Repeat Verse 1]
I'm like, she got cake for days
Got bands all on the plate
Baby girl, watch what you say
Put that cake in my face
I'm like she got cake though
Cake though, she got cake though
Look how it's moving, I'm swerving
Up in the corners, I'm getting to it
Bands though, I'm throwing bands though
I'm throwing mula
Touch mine, get your top popped
I'm a shooter
Beamer, with the top dropped
I'm a cruiser
Remy Boyz, that is my squad
It's a movement
Rob me? Nigga, haha
You're a loser
Your bitch got a fat ass
I'ma do her
Hulk smash, fuck her brains out
Knock the screws loose
Backwards, rolling backwards
I'm a guru
What I like, I'm Slick Rick
I'm a ruler
Rookie, on this rap shit, I can school you


[Bridge 2]
Ass so fat, got the whole club rocking
Pimp squad shit, got the whole club popping
Pressed and rolled, got the whole club walking
Shit straight drop, got the whole club popping

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
She got cake for days
Got bands all on the plate
Baby girl, I'd love to stay
Baby girl, watch what you say
I'm like, she got cake for days
Got bands all on the plate
Baby girl, watch what you say
Put that cake in my face
I'm blowing out the candles
