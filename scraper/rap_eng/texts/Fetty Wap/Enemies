{Verse 1}
Only rep the 12, Imma roll wit em
Homies hit me up, Imma go with em
Keep them 223’s, I’m a whole nigga
Keep a shovel cause, Imma hole digger
Niggas actin up, make the hole bigger
If I like your bitch, Imma go get her
Just to break his heart, let my bro hit her
Used to play my cards, now I roll with them
Niggas think they hard, Khaos go get em
Don’t miss em, turn you to a whole victim
My old system used to trap to nose flickers
Nose pickers, dope shooters, old kickers
Please don’t play with me, Imma pole gripper
I’m to famous now, let my bro get you
They can’t stand me now, and I know nigga
I know nigga, I know nigga

Actin, actin, actin funny, let the bangers spray
Most niggas I be sonin, Zoovie paved the way
You could hear how I be flowin, I got somethin to say
