[Chorus: Jussie Smollett]
This is our moment, ain't no holding us back, time to own it, yeah
Shining bright like the morning, it won't be long for the glory is coming, yeah
Come up and rise, I can feel the fire burning up inside
You know I am the one, the father and the son

[Verse 1: Jussie Smollett]
Look me in my eyes, are you watching?
Took him by surprise with no warning
It's God's doing, no one planned it
You must understand that your touch, you can hand it off
'Cause I been seeing out your window
Looking at my face like a mirror
Bridging up the clouds just to make a way
Passing through the storms from the rainy day
The sun used to be far away
But now he's right here even though it's in the distance
Saw you move the earth with your hands
Now I know it's getting hard, I'm first to assist ya
And when you're old and grey
Remember, I'll take care of ya
It is of a virtue, I do what I have to
We gotta let nature take its place

[Chorus: Jussie Smollett]
This is our moment, ain't no holding us back, time to own it, yeah
Shining bright like the morning, it won't be long for the glory is coming, yeah
Come up and rise, I can feel the fire burning up inside
You know I am the one, the father and the son
Yeah, yeah, yeah, father and the son
Yeah, yeah, yeah, father and the son

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Yeah, ayy, young, black brother from the struggle
Mama said I prayed, they can't touch ya
Only when you're heaven's high when they all love you
Lookin' in you, smellin' fine when they all hug ya
But baby, I'm a king, ayy, Mike Jordan, fist full of rings
Yeah, champion ahead of my league, yeah
Ayy, I only go to war for the green, yeah
I only show love for my team
Yeah, you know I got my kids, might show you how I live right
We was livin' wrong and now we all live right
Came where I come from, I'm just tryna live life
Try stick around, ayy, make it through my kids life
Feel like I was chosen, homie ya'll don't know none
How I went from homeless to million dollar homes, huh
First it wasn't on me and now I got the most
So they can never hate 'cause baby, I was chosen
We was livin' wrong and now we all live right
Came where I from and I'm just tryna live life
Try stick around and make through to my kids life, yeah

[Chorus: Jussie Smollett]
This is our moment, ain't no holding us back, time to own it, yeah
Shining bright like the morning, it won't be long for the glory is coming, yeah
Come up and rise, I can feel the fire burning up inside
You know I am the one, the father and the son
Yeah, yeah, yeah, father and the son
Yeah, yeah, yeah, father and the son
