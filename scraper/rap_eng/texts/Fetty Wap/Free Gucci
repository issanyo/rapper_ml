[Intro: Fetty Wap]
Ay, ay
10-1738
Ayo free my nigga Guwop

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
To wake up in the morning is a motherfucking blessing
Til they free my nigga Gucci, I ain’t motherfucking resting
I’ma pull me a ‘rari, I’ma park it right on Gresham
You gon see the king of diamonds, prince of diamonds standing next to him
Wake up in the morning is a motherfucking blessing
Til they free my nigga Gucci, I ain’t motherfucking resting
I’ma pull me a ‘rari, I’ma park it right on Gresham
You gon see the king of diamonds, prince of diamonds standing next to him

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Free my nigga Guwop, hit a doowap, roll a fucking doolie
My niggas is trap gods, Steven Spielberg with the fucking movies
Baby, call me ZooWap, call me Fetty or you could call me Zoovier
I been eating great, see that filet, my fork just go right through it
Bitch of mine named Stacy suck it great, I love the way she do it
Her ass holding weight, her shit so fat, I love the way she move it
Diamonds crystal clear, my shits on burr, my shits is looking bluish
Try step to my gang, that shit’s insane, why would you fucking do it?
Man that’s a mistake, that shit’s so dumb, why you so fucking foolish?
Diamonds crystal clear, my shits on burr, my shits is looking bluish
Try step to my gang, that shit’s insane, why would you fucking do it?
Man that’s a mistake, that shit’s so dumb, why you so fucking foolish?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Montana Bucks]
Just to wake up in the morning is a blessing
Won’t catch me slipping cause I keep that Smith & Wesson
Know what I’m sipping, bitch, I’m sipping on the seven
He’ll be missing if I find out he was flexing
Me and Jay on the eight, that’s a section
Give ‘em eight, then I skate like the Jetsons, ay
All this bread I’m investing, ay
Nigga had to get it, I was destined
Bitch I’m 17, you better not step to me
She popped that ecstasy; I whipped that recipe
She blow like referees, I move that heavy d
I call up Ebony, she hit up Stephanie
1738, see the murder rate
Tryna touch Wap, you gon be a murder case
Riding with the pistol, shit got dirty plates
We been getting money since an early age

[Hook]

[Verse 3: P-Dice]
Icicles in my time piece
Cartiers in my Guccis, I’m stunting
Look like I’m Gucci or something
Gripping on my nine piece
See a doughnut, nigga, ooh I be ducking
Nigga, ooh I be ducking
Smoking eighths of the indo, she too cute
And I’m paid so as the wind blow, she do too
Make it rain for the hell of it, purple haze, love the smell of it
Off a plane, I’m propelling it, off a plane, I’m propelling it
Way we’re stacking right, a molly got some freaks with me
Call us black and white, that mozzy look like Free Grilly
Got my pistols with my robot taking pics ho
I’m official, got my glow on, yeah my fist cold

[Hook]
