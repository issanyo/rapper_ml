[Chorus]
Something 'bout the way you break me down makes me stick around
Everyday I wake up make you smile, you should know by now
Every week we cruise around town and smoking something loud
Baby I be looking in your eyes, what is you about?
Every time they see me I'm with you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ain't nobody else I rather choose, yeah, yeah, yeah
Some will say a hunnid keep it true, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby I'ma always fuck with you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Something 'bout the way you break me down makes me stick around
Everyday I wake up make 'em smile, you should know by now
Every week we cruise around town and smoking something loud
Baby I be looking in your eyes, what is you about?

[Verse 1]
Something 'bout the way you do your thing now baby, yeah
Something 'bout the way I make you scream now baby, yeah
Make you wanna stay, know what I mean now baby?
Let a nigga play, I make it rain now baby
Better than okay, you are the King now
Gotta be a Queen, not in between now
Gotta be a star, gonna seek you far now baby
And move to the game, so you how I ball now baby
We can go and shop, I shut the mall down
We can spend a lot, I can bring it all out
Takin' off the top, when I bring the car out baby
We can keep it low, smoking out in Georgia

[Chorus]
Something 'bout the way you break me down makes me stick around
Everyday I wake up make you smile, you should know by now
Every week we cruise around town and smoking something loud
Baby I be looking in your eyes, what is you about?
Every time they see me I'm with you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ain't nobody else I rather choose, yeah, yeah, yeah
Some will say a hunnid keep it true, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby I'ma always fuck with you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Something 'bout the way you break me down makes me stick around
Everyday I wake up make 'em smile, you should know by now
Every week we cruise around town and smoking something loud
Baby I be looking in your eyes, what is you about?

[Verse 2]
This is what what you need now?
This is what what you need now?
Diamonds I make 'em freeze now
Diamonds I make 'em freeze now
??? you my keys now
??? you my keys now
You now what I mean now?
You now what I mean now?
Zoovier I keep it clean now
Zoovier I keep it clean now
Nigga my car is mean now
Nigga my car is mean now
Feeling like a machine now
Feeling like a machine now
For you I do anything now
For you I do anything now
I get money, that's all I dream 'bout
I get money, that's all I dream 'bout
But with you I'm living these dreams now
But with you I'm living these dreams now
Always keep running this weed out
Always keep running this weed out
And the tents they can't see us baby
And the tents they can't see us baby

[Chorus]
Something 'bout the way you break me down makes me stick around
Everyday I wake up make you smile, you should know by now
Every week we cruise around town and smoking something loud
Baby I be looking in your eyes, what is you about?
Every time they see me I'm with you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ain't nobody else I rather choose, yeah, yeah, yeah
Some will say a hunnid keep it true, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby I'ma always fuck with you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Something 'bout the way you break me down makes me stick around
Everyday I wake up make 'em smile, you should know by now
Every week we cruise around town and smoking something loud
Baby I be looking in your eyes, what is you about?

[Outro]
Something 'bout the way you break me down makes me stick around
Baby we can cruise around the town smoking something loud
Every time they see me I'm with you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Every time they see me I'm with you, yeah, yeah, yeah
