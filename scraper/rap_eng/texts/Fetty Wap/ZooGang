[Hook: Fetty Wap] (2x)
I said baby it's the ZooGang, we too live
Turning up with his boo thang, oh my god
We be changing bitches' mood swings on the spot
He get hit up over loose change, blaow blaow blaow

[Verse 1 Zoogangsavage]
All the bitches wanna sex us, you mad cause we next up
Bitch I'm 1738, better catch up
Tryna flex, bet the chopper hit him from the neck up
They gon' say the way them niggas did 'em, it was messed up
Your bitch on my dick cause I'm slick with a fresh cut
If you thought that I ain't have it on me, nigga guess what
All night at the dog fight put your bets up
All ice, you'll catch frostbite if your hand touch
Big bank, I got big bank, get your bands up
Ben Frank, nigga Ben Frank, that's my nigga
Then hit my nigga, one call will get you dead
It's the ZooGang, bitch we ball like the Wizards

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Money what I'm fishing for
Sip heavy lean with everything it got my vision blurred
I been around, you been a clown
I'll blow your circus up
I'm here with friends, you scared to swim
You couldn't surf with us, nah you couldn't surf with us
Bad ho, I put her first
Cause she ain't nothing like my last ho
I let it squirt and then I slide off in a fast Rove'
I let it pop, that's how I am, fuck a fifth of the Remy
That's a shot to a giant, this is ZooGang
Ain't have to say it, they already know the crew name
We after payment getting fetty while my crew came
We after payment getting fetty while my crew came
Nigga this is ZooGang, fuck you know 'bout

[Hook]
