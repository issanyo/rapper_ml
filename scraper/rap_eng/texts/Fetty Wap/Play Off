[Hook: Monty]
All that hatin, ain't gon' get you paid boy
Hater blockers, so I got my shades on
No days, never took a day off
I been ballin' like I'm in the playoffs
All that hatin, ain't gon' get you paid boy
Hater blockers, so I got my shades on
No days, never took a day off
I been ballin' like I'm in the playoffs

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
I be ballin hard, like the play?
23 for the kicks, MJ
Got a badass bitch, pretty face
Big ol' booty, with the itty bitty waist
Heard you niggas want a war, let it spray
I'm a 22nd soldier, know a nigga love to play
Two iced out Rollie's, check the face
I'm a trap boy, I be gettin' cake
Where you at boy? I will really pull up where you stay
Keep a gat boy, and they know the Zoovie love to bang
I'm an Itchy boy, 1700 what I bang
For my mob niggas, I be really Pippen everyday
On the job boy, bitch I'm Poppa Smurf, they know the name
I'm a hot boy, see me swervin' in and out of lanes
For my squad boy, Zoovie Zoo don't talk, I let it rain
I'm a hot boy and I got the island on my chain, yea

[Hook: Monty]
All that hatin, ain't gon' get you paid boy
Hater blockers, so I got my shades on
No days, never took a day off
I been ballin' like I'm in the playoffs
All that hatin, ain't gon' get you paid boy
Hater blockers, so I got my shades on
No days, never took a day off
I been ballin' like I'm in the playoffs

[Verse 2: Monty]
I be shittin' on em' fuck what they thought
Pull up to the club in the race car
I'm just gettin' to it, why you hate for
Niggas in the field, ain't talkin' baseball
.40 to his face dog
Shorty wanna 8-ball
I'm already gettin' money, I'm just tryna' make more
Yea I know you hate this
I be goin' ape shit
Louis on my bracelet
Used to work a day shift

[Bridge: Monty]
All that hatin, ain't gon' get you paid boy
Hater blockers, so I got my shades on
No days, never took a day off
I been ballin' like I'm in the playoffs

[Hook: Monty]
All that hatin, ain't gon' get you paid boy
Hater blockers, so I got my shades on
No days, never took a day off
I been ballin' like I'm in the playoffs
All that hatin, ain't gon' get you paid boy
Hater blockers, so I got my shades on
No days, never took a day off
I been ballin' like I'm in the playoffs

[Hook: Monty and Fetty Wap]
All that hatin, ain't gon' get you paid boy
Hater blockers, so I got my shades on
No days, never took a day off
I been ballin' like I'm in the playoffs
