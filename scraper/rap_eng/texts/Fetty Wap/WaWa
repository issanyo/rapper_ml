Run up on my boys, and I know we gon' run
If I give this bitch a pass, then I know she gon' come
If I give this bitch a pack, then I know she gon' run

And I throw up big P's cause the zoo is not blood
Only carry big guap cause the zoo is no scrub
I'm a pimp mofucka', the zoo is no thug
And I throw up big P's cause the zoo is not blood
Only carry big guap cause the zoo is no scrub
I'm a pimp mofucka', Piru in my blood
