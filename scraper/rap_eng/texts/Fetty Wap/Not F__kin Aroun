[Verse 1: Kaden Butler]
It is very miraculous
It is like the whole body made of wrapper and shit
But they don't think a rapper don't rap about this shit?
What the fuck you know, just hanging out bitch
Stop fucking around, I ain't playing no games
You just want to get famous, standing in the rain
Gonna get no where, damn asshole
But in seven years, gonna have a fucking show
Yeah, go and made fun
But while I'm at it you're a fucking dumb
Wasting your breath on me isn't humor
Just shut your loud ass mouth and seal her

Stop, stop fucking around
Any suggestions, I don't give a fuck
Stop fucking around, go dumb fuck and go fuck yourself

I know I don't have a girl, but it doesn't mean nothing
Y'all talk about Egdgely smoking weed and drunkin
Bet ya mom don't know ya not carvin the pumpkin
Aren't ya like one of those motherfuckers hanging with Depal
He love to bringing people down, impale him on a steeple
Look, impersonating Kaden, he is a fucking dick head
If you ever hear this shit, Imma knock you till ya fuckin dead
And then I'll tweet this shit, shit gone viral
Fuck yes then I'll be in the metal spirals
(Can I get your attention please? please? please? )
Shut your motherfucking mouth
Right now! I'm trying to listen to the teacher
Why y'all at this school? I'm trying to find out
The reason behind meditation bitch!
You know what, keep on bitchin
Meditating sucks, I'd rather go smoke some weed and lean back with some motherfucking vodka
Yo!! Oldem, go fuck yourself...haha

2017...no 18...fuckin around...pass me that blunt...cmon bruh...
"It's done"

"You've got be fucking kidding me, what the fuck is your fucking problem you fucking asshole go to hell bitch, do you know how much this shit cost you wasted your godamn money on sunflower seeds? Faggot."
