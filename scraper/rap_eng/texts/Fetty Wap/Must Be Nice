[intro: FVRTHR]
Its must be, its must be nice, its must be nice

[hook]
We ain't got no time to lose
Girl, all I ever want is you
Yeah, we ain't got no time, to lose
When I look around I'm seeing you
Oh my God she must be nice
It must be nice
All of you on top of me, showing me a knot
Girl it must be nice, it must be nice
You and me baby, it must be nice

[verse 1- Fetty wap]
