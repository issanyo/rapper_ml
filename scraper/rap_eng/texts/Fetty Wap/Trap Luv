[Intro]
Zoovier, 1738

[Hook]
I wake up in the morning, all I think is flip
Count a couple hundreds, flip a couple bricks
Time to hit the plug now, need another flip
Counting all this money, got me filthy rich
Wake up in the morning, all I think is flip
Count a couple hundreds, flip a couple bricks
Time to hit the plug now, need another flip
Counting all this money, got me filthy rich

[Bridge]
Baby that's my trap luv, ayy
Baby that's the trap luv, ayy
And all my niggas trap drugs, ayy
ZooGang we some trap lords, ayy

[Hook]
I wake up in the morning, all I think is flip, ayy
Count a couple hundreds, flip a couple bricks, ayy
Time to hit the plug now, need another flip, ayy
Counting all this money, got me feeling rich, ayy

[Verse 1]
She know Zoovie, Iâ€™m a trap god, baby
She wanna ride 'round with a trap star, baby
You know they watch me like a plasma, baby
Caught your Birkin ass, my baby
Might go cop an Aston, baby
Zoovie I'm the captain, baby
You know she trying to trill me, baby
You know she gotta feel me, baby
I might go cop me a Rarri, ayy
I'm life of the party, ayy
ZooGang turn up naughty, ayy
ZooWap, Dice and Monty

Wake up in the morning, all I think is flip
Count a couple hundreds, flip a couple bricks
Time to hit the plug now, need another flip
Counting all this money, got me filthy rich
