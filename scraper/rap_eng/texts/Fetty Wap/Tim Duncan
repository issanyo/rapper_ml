[Hook: P-Dice]
I’m finna ball just like I’m Duncan
I pass your bitch off, my niggas dunk it
I pass that burner off, they blam it down
I throw that money up, they slam it down
(2x)

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Remy Boyz
I know you niggas heard us, we make plenty noise
Them choppas leave you hurting, we got plenty toys
I said, bitch, we are the motherfucking Remy Boyz
We get plenty love, I got plenty plugs
Bitch, my trap be jumping, I buys plenty drugs
Try to take it from me, wish a nigga would
Look this forty, it go bang-bang at his fucking head
Leave that nigga dead, niggas will catch you slipping
That mean your ass was lacking, you ain’t had a pistol
Black and, black and white stripes, I am so official
Fetty, Fetty Cash shitting on them, where’s the tissue
Bad bitches on a nigga, I dont’t have an issue
All I want is money, you can have your heart
I never loved a bitch and I ain’t tryna start
You can suck my dick and then we falling off
Cause baby, all I want is drink the furnace full of drugs

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Montana Bucks]
Balling like Tim Duncan
Your bitch coming through, it’s only ten something
Balling on the court now
Like Shaq, how my niggas bring the court down
And we be throwing alley-oops
I could show your bitch what the molly do
You think you tough, we get rowdy too
I g’stroll through your strip in the Cali coupe
Riding in my car tints
Balling on these niggas like I’m Shawn Kemp
And I got shooters like Robert Horry
I hit my connect, he said he got it for me
Cause I be balling like I’m CP
Late night, I pull up at the BP
Long range shooting, that’s the deep three
Remy Boyz, nigga, we the big three

[Hook]

[Verse 3: P-Dice]
Remy Boyz and we up in here
I can tell that you fucking scared
Got your girl in her underwear
Cutting crack on that tupperware
Blowing stacks, I’m that type of guy
E pills my type of high
He real, I ain’t tryna stunt
He be hurting my [?]
I be in the playoffs, trust me I’m a true G
Hit you, then, I skate off, Kristi Yamaguchi
Expialidocious, trust me ya’ll, I’m focused
Pockets looking too right, fuck boy that you notice
I’m up boy while you sleeping, I ain’t get a wink yet
Man, I only think checks, [?] on my mind
Tell her that I only need neck, like the way that she grind
Man, I swear that ass is the best, DJ Khaled and ‘em
We be styling on rims, easy styling with friends
Fuck g’s, I’m piling them m’s, sluts we piling them in
Remy Boyz, oh, they be bumping
Balling out like we Tim Duncan, balling like Tim Duncan

[Hook]
