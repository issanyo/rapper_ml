[Verse 1: Zoey Clarke]
Time slips into the future
Ain't getting no younger, cloud 9 every day
The dance floor is awaiting
Handclap, don't hold back, hearts racing

[Chorus: Zoey Clarke]
Look at me, I'm high as a shooting star
Fast as a speeding bullet, I can't stop, I won't stop
Look at me, high as a shooting star
Fast as a speeding bullet, I can't stop, I won't stop

[Verse 2: Zoey Clarke]
Been a rider, just had the wrong driver
I was hiding, just waiting for you to find my mind
It's time my world begin to change, my eyes blur nights from days
I want this, I need this, the rush, the high, the pain

[Chorus: Zoey Clarke]
Look at me, I'm high as a shooting star
Fast as a speeding bullet, I can't stop, I won't stop
Look at me, high as a shooting star
Fast as a speeding bullet, I can't stop, I won't stop

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
Look at me lookin' at you
You my drug, I need a dosage, baby
The more we should, I think, come closer, baby
Give me your love 'til it run over, baby
Yahhhhh baby
Name a thing I wanna do, off with you, I'ma act a fool
This drug's so real, don't let it take control, baby
Name a thing I wanna do, off with you, I act a fool
This drug's so real, don't let it take control, baby
Baby we gon' take a ride in the club
Start it up, lit the ganja, we high
Swear you is my jewel baby, want you love, baby
You know my name, Zoovier from ZooGang

[Chorus: Zoey Clarke]
Look at me, I'm high as a shooting star
Fast as a speeding bullet, I can't stop, I won't stop
Look at me, high as a shooting star
Fast as a speeding bullet, I can't stop, I won't stop
