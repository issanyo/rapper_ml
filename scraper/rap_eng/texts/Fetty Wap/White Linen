[Verse 1]
You were comin’ down the escalator when I seen you
Tight fit skirt, a lil walkin’, never mean to
Lil conversation, playin cool, and kept it clean too
When I say, I got you forever, this what I mean boo
Wasn’t bout your looks, or the money, you had the crib too
I’m about your hustle and you wasn’t on the scene too
Niggas might have wanted you, but I fiend you
Had to show you what you was workin’
Yea the Zoo feel your hurt

[Bridge]
Now baby, look we at
You a boss for a fact
Yea, shorty I got you right, shorty I never gon’ wrong
Yea, and even when I was wrong, by a nigga side
Yea, kept it real with a nigga, you ain’t ever lie
Yea, shorty I got you right, shorty I never gon’ wrong
Yea, and even when I was wrong, by a nigga side
Yea, kept it real with a nigga, you ain’t ever lie
Look, shorty you got my heart, shorty you beautiful

[Hook]
Ay, white linen and grape fragrance, Ooh I wanna love you baby
Yea, ay, sweet curves and tight spaces, Ooh I wanna touch you baby
Yea, and you the one that I’m on
The only one that I want
I hope you hearin’ this song, yeah baby
I think of you when I’m gone
You know I’m bringing it home, Ooh you know I love you baby
Ay, white linen and grape fragrance, Ooh I wanna love you baby
Yea, ay, sweet curves and tight spaces, Ooh I wanna touch you baby
Yea, and you the one that I’m on
The only one that I want
I hope you hearin’ this song, yeah baby
I think of you when I’m gone
You know I’m bringing it home, Ooh you know I love you baby

[Verse 2]
Straight to it, first love with a savage
Never trust a bitch, gettin’ money, now I’m past that
Never lot of clothes, to the cash like accent
Never let a nobody stare for cold reasons
Trappin’ out the crack house, turn it for a season
Pilin’, jabbin’, J’s for a season
And you gettin’ thick girl, what you been eatin’
Cornbread, stuffing, chicken with the seasoning
I know you love the i8, wherever we go, the keys been
Had it for the most, cause it only big weekends
She was like, LOL, I said I know you very well
Chanel spray your difference, so girl I know your image smell
Take you ‘round that world and baby that’s an overseas
You sayin’ a lot of strong women what a nigga see
And you, from the crown on your head, to your little feet
I love it when they mention you, baby let em know it’s me
Yea, 1738

[Hook]
Ay, white linen and grape fragrance, Ooh I wanna love you baby
Yea, ay, sweet curves and tight spaces, Ooh I wanna touch you baby
Yea, and you the one that I’m on
The only one that I want
I hope you hearin’ this song, yeah baby
I think of you when I’m gone
You know I’m bringing it home, Ooh you know I love you baby

[Outro]
Ay, white linen and grape fragrance, Ooh I wanna love you baby
Yea, ay, sweet curves and tight spaces, Ooh I wanna touch you baby
You the one that I’m on
One that I want
Hearin’ this song, yeah baby
I think of you when I’m gone
Bringin’ it home
Ooh, I wanna love you baby
