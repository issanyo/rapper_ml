{Hook}
I stay down, so loud, it’s time to shine like a light
In the trap, I was breaking shit down, every night
Real facts, had to see my mother’s face every night
Real facts, lawyers on my brother’s case, get him right
Where I’m at, probably somewhere countin money, livin life
Smokin gas, I just need a cup of Henny with the ice
Imma keep on gettin chicken with the rice
Imma always be rich all my life
I stay down, so loud, it’s time to shine like a light
In the trap, I was breaking shit down, every night
Real facts, had to see my mother’s face every night
Real facts, lawyers on my brother’s case, get him right
Where I’m at, probably somewhere countin money, livin life
Smokin gas, I just need a cup of Henny with the ice
Imma keep on gettin chicken with the rice
Imma always be rich all my life

{Verse 1}
I am really rich, he just gettin by
Bought the bitch a whip, she just couldn’t drive
Everyday we lit, we just gettin high
Everyday we rich, they know I’m the shit
5 M’s in the tuck, Rollie for the kids
If you ain’t have my God touch, than you know lit
Niggas with you won’t bust, than you know you hit
Niggas with me, I trust, really with the shits
For the gang, walked a mile
Nigga ditched, nigga goin
If you think that they won’t for the King, than you wrong
I ain’t even gon talk bout no bling on this song
I just went 300 M’s out this thing, and I’m gone
Used to really get it on the 12
Used to really get it on the scale
Free all my bros out the cell
Free all my bros from the 12

I stay down, so loud, it’s time to shine like a light
In the trap, I was breaking shit down, every night
Real facts, had to see my mother’s face every night
Real facts, lawyers on my brother’s case, get him right
Where I’m at, probably somewhere countin money, livin life
Smokin gas, I just need a cup of Henny with the ice
Imma keep on gettin chicken with the rice
Imma always be rich all my life

{Verse 2}
I really had to get it how I earned it
Fuck niggas, I don’t want bridges, we could burn em
RGF, I’m a level up what they earnin
To preach his kid, they don’t really wanna hear my sermon
Make way for fuck niggas and duck niggas
For a rush nigga, where I’m from, we bust niggas
Only us nigga, only the family I trust nigga
In the tour, only way I’m takin a bus nigga
On the shore, only way that I’m takin a flush nigga
Take the pistol and aim it at us nigga
Don’t be nervous, be ready to clutch nigga
Block jumpin, we doublin up nigga
Shit be real though, and I ain’t every talkin clay
Bikes out, hit the city, what I call a day
I gotta make at least a hundred for your boy away
Confirmation from the bank, they make sure it straight
