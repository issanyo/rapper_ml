[Intro: Rawyals]
Ahh, ahh, ahh, king me
Ahh, ahh, ahh

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Ay, ayy
Nigga don't hit my phone cause I ain't got no service
Shitting on all these pawns, I do this shit on purpose
My queen gon' hold me down
Watch how she come through swerving
Everything that we got, I swear we put that work in
I don't owe a nigga anything, I don't owe a nigga anything
Cause baby I'm royal, cause baby I'm royal
Coming through with a bad bitch brand new and a drop top foreign
Fucking with Zoogang, Zoovier, baby cause you know I'm scoring
Baby I'm royal, I said it gotdamn it I'm royal
They know that I ball like Jordan
Zoogod, Zoovier, king I'm scoring, swoosh!

[Verse 2: Rawyals]
I don't associate with lames, no
Another level, we are not the same, no
Chess or checkers. I'm gon' end the game, oh
A pawn and queen together, never stay in your lane
Baby I, I don't do it
Out of your league, you must be stupid
Up on this pedestal looking at you acting like a groupie
Got my crown on tilt cause I know they watching, watching me
Cause I ain't no regular, regular, nah bitch I'm royalty

[Hook: Rawyals]
King me
That's what I tell them every time they choose me
King me
That's how they be cause they don't wanna lose me
King me
I'm selfish, I can't help it, I'm so spoiled
King me
R-r-r-royal, king me ahh ahh ahh

[Verse 3: Rawyals]
I. Trust I do thank the Lord for my existence
Call me cocky, no, well at least I'm consistent
Slaying hoes, can't deploy me, I'm 'bout my business
Don't need no knight in shining armor, fuck Prince Charming
Daddy I, I don't do it
Out of your league, you must be stupid
Up on this pedestal looking at you acting like a groupie
Got my crown on tilt cause I know they watching, watching me
Cause I ain't no regular, regular, nah bitch I'm royalty

[Hook]

[Bridge: Rawyals]
Cleopatra queen if she were Nefertiti
Angel, Ariel, and Paris sittin' pretty
And I don't need no King Arthur, call me Hostidty
Ain't ever been regular, regular, nah bitch I'm royalty

[Hook 2x]

[Outro: Fetty Wap & Rawyals]
I don't owe a nigga anything, I don't owe a nigga anything (King me)
Cause baby I'm royal, cause baby I'm royal (King me)
I don't owe a nigga anything, yeah ay (king me)
Cause baby I'm royal, cause baby I'm royal
