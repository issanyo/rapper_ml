[Verse 1]
Yeah
Baby girl, you're so damn fine though
Wanna know if I could hit it from behind though
I'm sipping on you like some fine wine though
When it's over, I press rewind though
Talking bands, I got it
Benjamins in my pocket
I traded in my Trues for some Robins
Then he playing Batman, Fetty's gon' rob him, Yeah
I got the Glock in my 'Rari
17 shots, no .38
Yeah, I got the Glock in my 'Rari
17 shots, no .38

[Bridge]
Yeah, she's fine
Wonder when she'll be mine
Walk past, I press rewind
See that ass one more time

[Hook]
And I got this sewed up
Remy Boyz, they know us
All fast money, no slow bucks
No one can control us
And I got this sewed up
Remy Boyz, they know us
All fast money, no slow bucks
No one can control us

[Verse 2]
She’s got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild
Very low-key on the profile
Catching feelings is a no
Let me show you how it goes
Herb’s the word, spin’s the verb
Lovers it curves, freak what you heard

[Bridge 2]
I like the way you work it (No Diggity)
I’m bout to bag it up
I like the way you work it (No Diggity)
I’m bout to bag it up
I like the way you work it (No Diggity)
Bout to bag it up
I like the way you work it

[Hook]

[Outro x3]
No diggity darling
I like the way you work it (1738)
No diggity darling
I'm bout to bag it up (1738)
