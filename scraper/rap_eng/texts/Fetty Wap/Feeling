[Chorus]
I fell in love with the cash, I fell out of my feelings
And I go and get the bags, stack it up for my children
Make a lot of people mad but that paper keep coming
Bitch we runnin', Zoovie Zoo, I'm 'bout to turn up the summer
I fell in love with the cash, I fell out of my feelings
I go and get the bags, stack it up for my children
Make a lot of people mad but that paper keep coming
Bitch we runnin', Zoovie Zoo, I'm 'bout to turn up the summer

[Verse]
Shawty get it up, I can get it on, just hit my line
Baby I'm a boss, get what you want, don't waste no time
Love the way you shake, just like the number, you be four nine
Show you why you fake, man sure you is a lame, damn
Is you tryna skate? I got the Rover parked outside
We can drive estates, just spread your wings, I can make you fly
Is you understand, I swear I want you to be mine baby
Swimming in your lake, I'ma take my time baby
Show you why you great, I don't gotta press rewind baby
Just like a star, I love the way you shine baby
Is you understand, I swear I want you to be mine baby
Show you why you great, I don't gotta press rewind baby

[Chorus]
I fell in love with the cash, I fell out of my feelings
Ayy I go and get the bags, stack it up for my children
Make a lot of people mad but that paper keep coming
Bitch we runnin', Zoovie Zoo, I'm 'bout to turn up the summer
I fell in love with the cash, I fell out of my feelings
Ayy I go and get the bags, stack it up for my children
Make a lot of people mad but that paper keep coming
Bitch we runnin', Zoovie Zoo, I'm 'bout to turn up the summer
