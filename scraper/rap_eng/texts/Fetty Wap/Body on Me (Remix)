[Intro: Chris Brown & Fetty Wap]
Oh, oh, oh
Yaaaaaaaah, baby, ayy

[Verse 1: Rita Ora]
Baby, let's cut down the lights
I just really wanna let this fire burn bright (yup)
I'm just telling you to have an open mind (yup)
Just imagine us, woo (yup)

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
You're taking me there, you're taking me there (yup)
Our lips are barely touching (yup)
So do it again, so do it again
We could be on to something

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me (yup)
Heyo, heyo, if you want it, then you got it, hold me (yup)
No more, no more wasting time, we can, we can go all night (yup)
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya, ooh
Body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya, ooh
Body on me

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Yaaaaaaaah, baby, ayy, ayy
I know you like to feel on my body (yeah, baby)
Let me take you for a ride in my 'rari (skrrt) (yup)
When I see you, you just make me do somethin'
Too pretty, goin' in a museum (yup)
Take your time, baby girl, don't rush it
You know my name, know the game and who run it (yup)
Said you want diamonds, big house and gold, baby (yeah, baby)
Anything you want, I get for you, baby (yup)
So can you tell me what's the plan, baby?
Is that your friend or your man, baby?
Yaaaaaah, baby (yup)
I wasn't scared to let you in, baby
Gave you the keys to every Benz, baby
Yaaaaaah, baby (yup)

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me (yup)
Heyo, heyo, if you want it, then you got it, hold me (yup)
No more, no more wasting time, we can, we can go all night (yup)
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya
Body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya
Body on me

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Put you up against the wall (yup)
And I'ma go to work 'til you get off
Baby, soon as you're done we'll go some more, oh, oh (yup)
Girl, just imagine us

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & Chris Brown]
You're taking me there, you're taking me there (yup)
Our lips are barely touching, oh, oh, oh (yup)
So do it again, so do it again
We could be on to something, oh

[Chorus: Rita Ora & Chris Brown]
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me (yup)
Heyo, heyo, if you want it, then you got it, hold me (yeah) (yup)
No more, no more wasting time, we can, we can go all night (we can go all night) (yup)
