[Intro]
Lil' bitch

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Yeah, run my check up, I'ma check you in this bitch
Aye, playin' chess, you playin' checkers in this bitch
Aye, keep a tool, Black & Decker in this bitch
Aye, keep a gun around, check us on a hit
Yeah, and we run the town that's just what it is
Yeah, when we come around, brazy with the whips
Yeah, aye, keep one in the head, brazy with the clips
Yeah, I got homies bangin' blood, brothers bangin' crip

[Refrain: Fetty Wap]
Yeah, aye, apartment to a house, now I got six
Aye, departments and accounts, I am not rich
Yeah, aye, chains aren't ever bought just deposit
Yeah bitch, I got your account in my closet
Yeah bitch, I spent your advance on a 'Rarri
Yeah bitch, I get 60k to host a party
Yeah, I got three credit cards in my wallet
Yeah, for my cash, for my momma and for ballin'

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Yeah, run my check up, I'ma check you in this bitch
Aye, playin' chess, you playin' checkers in this bitch
Aye, keep a tool, Black & Decker in this bitch
Aye, keep a gun around, check us on a hit
Yeah, and we run the town that's just what it is
Yeah, when we come around, brazy with the whips
Yeah, aye, keep one in the head, brazy with the clips
Yeah, I got homies bangin' blood, brothers bangin' crip

[Verse 2: Fuzz]
Fight a Zuul, I'm a fool for the clique
Fully loaded on my bitch, she gon' dump a whole clip
Chat boys lurking, they be watching niggas move
We don't go nowhere without that motherfuckin' tool
Bring a hot tech, pour that shit out [?]
Hit the dealership, I know I'm fat but I'ma coupe it
Lil' bitches wanna fall in love but, I ain't cupid
Fuckers wanna set me up, wet me up but, I ain't stupid
No, I ain't stupid, pushed a button, now we ruthless
Smacked you with the handle of the 40, now you toothless
And it's a throwaway, I shoot you then the shoot's lit
Couple niggas only famous and they all ruthless
Fuzzy Fuzz get the MAC with the muzz
I cock back and blast it at thugs and ratchet
You askin' for sluts, fuck that
We ridin' deep dishes, foreign wishes
VVS freezes in the kitchen and they want the whippin'
Wassup?

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Yeah, run my check up, I'ma check you in this bitch
Aye, playin' chess, you playin' checkers in this bitch
Aye, keep a tool, Black & Decker in this bitch
Aye, keep a gun around, check us on a hit
Yeah, and we run the town that's just what it is
Yeah, when we come around, brazy with the whips
Yeah, aye, keep one in the head, brazy with the clips
Yeah, I got homies bangin' blood, brothers bangin' crip

[Refrain: Fetty Wap]
Yeah, aye, apartment to a house, now I got six
Aye, departments and accounts, I am not rich
Yeah, aye, chains aren't ever bought just deposit
Yeah bitch, I got your account in my closet
Yeah bitch, I spent your advance on a 'Rarri
Yeah bitch, I get 60k to host a party
Yeah, I got three credit cards in my wallet
Yeah, for my cash, for my momma and for ballin'

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Yeah, run my check up, I'ma check you in this bitch
Aye, playin' chess, you playin' checkers in this bitch
Aye, keep a tool, Black & Decker in this bitch

Yeah, aye, keep one in the head, brazy with the clips
Yeah, I got homies bangin' blood, brothers bangin' crip
