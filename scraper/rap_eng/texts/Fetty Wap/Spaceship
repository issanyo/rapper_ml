[Fetty Wap]
On everything that's my spaceship
Disrespect my girl, I'ma give your ass a facelift
Do this shit for Franklins and Benjamins, they my favorite
Tell me why you here, cut the shit, girl who you playing with?
The squad of the year, RGF is here to claim it
ZooWap, I'm the man from the bando, what you saying?
I can take your ho with bands, I speak a different language
I might flex, finesse, I check your ho and who she came with, ayy

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Have you ever seen a spaceship, ay
Traveling to different places, ay
Them Benjamins, I'm talking faces, ay
Come take a ride up on my spaceship, ay
Y-young niggas, we flexing
Young nigga we up next man
Young niggas, we flexing, ay
Have you ever seen a spaceship, ay
Traveling to different places, ay

[Nikosi]
I'm taking off just like a spaceship
Success is near and I can taste it
Nothing was ever given, I had to take it
T-times got hard, I had to face it
But I promise all of my niggas we gon' make it
And if they don't open the door, then we gon' break it
Like, what the fuck is you thinking?
Won't stop 'til we laughing all the way to the bank
Counting Benjamin Franklins, foreigns, Lambos and Bentleys
Gas tank never empty, all these women tryna to tip me
Watching out for them niggas that be hating living with envy
Once you get money the people start to get friendly
Ain't got much friends but that money, yeah I got plenty
When it come to them hundreds, Nikosi be many
I do this shit for my family
Said I do this shit for my family

[Chorus]
[North Maine]
Young nigga, we up next
All I know is hustle, flex
Jersey nigga, that's what I rep
Any disrespect, then I'll foot your neck
And I put that on my mama, you don't want that drama
As a young nigga on the block, I had to learn to make commas
When you make money, fake friends hate
Backstabbers take off your plate
Grass cut, I can see y'all snakes
I'm a real nigga, most of y'all fake
Claim the streets but talk to the jakes
If you not real, then I can't relate
Chasing all these dead faces
When we talkin' y'all don't conversate
Hit me up, I don't chase
All fly, I stay space baby
From the jungle where it's wild and crazy
This stress going through a lot lately
Sitting like dear Lord please save me
Never giving up, still dream chasing
With my team in that spaceship
Flying to [?]

[Chorus]
