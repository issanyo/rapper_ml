[Chorus: Young Thug]
Do it big, do it big
Nigga, livin' for the kids (makin' money, hell yeah)

Brand new day (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Brand new day
It's a brand new day (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
It's a brand new day (Thugger!)
It's a whole 'nother year (whole 'nother year)
I lived a whole 'nother year
Let's ball a whole 'nother year
I don't wann' shoot nobody up
I don't wann' leave nobody stuck
I don't wanna wish bad luck (hell no)
But I don't mind fuckin' it up
Let's blow some bands on some bands, I got cash
I spent 200, fuck 200 on the dash
I put some white shit on her motherfuckin' jag
And it ain't gon' never make her sad in case I meet her dad
Cause you never wanna see a fine baby dad mad (I swear)
I said, I never-ever-ever wanna see my main baby dad mad (promise)
And she gon' hold me down cause she 'posed to
And she gon' stuff me down like she 'posed to
In every other town, they don't know you
And just for that, I eat her down like I 'posed to
Roller coaster, Cosa Nostra
Yea, I beat it down like I'm 'posed to
And I asked her how they used to eat
And she said she wanna dine with me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Do it big, do it big
Nigga, livin' for the kids (makin' money, hell yeah)
It's a brand new day
Everybody like my kin
We live a brand new day (yeah, yeah)
It's a brand new day (do it big for my friends)
Brand new day (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Brand new day
It's a brand new day (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Watch me ball with my dogs (ball with my niggas)
Long and fat like a hog (fat, chubby)
I just bought momma house
And I did that without a scout (I did that without a scout)
I'm screamin', "fuck the police" (fuck 12)
I leave red bottles in the street
I post a chicky bout my court
My AP silver like a quarter
I wanna fuck without a Trojan
I wanna fuck without a Magnum
I wanna fuck without abortion
I spent some bands on porcelains
I spent some money on my implant
My money stacked up like I'm Durant
Therefore, these niggas smaller than an ant
Get that bitch some wood like a fuckin' branch
Bitch, I'm walkin' green like I'm The Grinch
I run the city like I'm the man
I know you can't picture me in no trash can
No Michael but my pockets filled with Jacksons (all 20's)
Soon as I got rich, they started textin'
I spent 10 thousand on the plastic
She wearin' very fine fabric
And she bought Chanel for her last friend (yeah)

[Chorus: Young Thug + Fetty Wap]
Do it big, do it big
Nigga, livin' for the kids (makin' money, hell yeah)
It's a brand new day
Everybody like my kin
We live a brand new day (yeah, yeah)
It's a brand new day, it's a brand new day (do it big for my friends)
Brand new day (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Brand new day (1738)
It's a brand new day ( zoovier, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap)
It's a brand new day, let's live it big
I'm just tryna get this cash and get [?]
Brand new, yeah, I could take you there
If you want, girl, I can be your man
What's your plan?
Ay, I can tell when I'm up on stage, she watches me
And I know she don't want no bands, she got me
So, I keep [?] with ice, my baby lookin' so right
Shinin' brighter than lights like "yeah, babe"
Ay, I can tell when I'm up on stage, she watches me
And I know she don't want no bands, she got me
So, I keep [?] with ice, my baby lookin' so right
She shinin' brighter than lights like "yeah, babe"

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Do it big, do it big
Nigga, livin' for the kids (makin' money, hell yeah)
It's a brand new day
Everybody like my kin
We live a brand new day (yeah, yeah)
It's a brand new day (do it big for my friends)
Brand new day (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Brand new day
It's a brand new day (yeah, yeah, yeah)
