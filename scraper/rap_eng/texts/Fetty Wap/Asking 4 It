[Verse 1]
Oh why, why would, why would you wanna be
Why would you wanna be with someone like me?
Oh why, why would, why would you wanna live
Why would you wanna Li-Live so recklessly?

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know where I was, I was lost, I was nothing
The real version of me, I had never even seen
You givin' me truth and it's such an unfamiliar subject
So, could you answer me please?

[Chorus]
Are you sure you wanna love me?
Are you sure you wanna love me?
You're asking for it, you're asking for it
And I'm just saying, boy
You're asking for it, you're asking for it
Are you sure you wanna love me?
Are you sure you wanna love me?
You're asking for it, you're asking for it
And I'm just saying, boy
You're asking for it, you're asking for it
I dare ya, dare ya, dare ya
You're asking for it, you're asking for it
And I'm just saying, boy
You're asking for it, you're asking for it
I dare ya, dare ya, dare ya
You're asking for it, you're asking for it
And I'm just saying, boy
You're asking for it, you're asking for it
I dare ya, dare ya, dare ya

[Verse 2]
I, I know, I know that it's a lot
I know that it's a lot to handle me
But it, it is, but it is what it is
It's all a part of my broken history

[Pre-Chorus:]
I don't know where I was, I was lost, I was nothing
The real version of me, I had never even seen
You givin' me truth and it's such an unfamiliar subject
So, could you answer me please?

[Chorus]
Are you sure you wanna love me?
Are you sure you wanna love me?
You're asking for it, you're asking for it
And I'm just saying, boy
You're asking for it, you're asking for it
I dare ya, dare ya, dare ya
You're asking for it, you're asking for it
And I'm just saying, boy
You're asking for it, you're asking for it
I dare ya, dare ya, dare ya
You're asking for it, you're asking for it
And I'm just saying, boy
You're asking for it, you're asking for it
I dare ya, dare ya, dare ya
