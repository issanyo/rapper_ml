If I call would you ride, baby?
Need you right by my side, baby
Show 'em how to ride or die, baby
Hold me down, never lie, baby
If I call would you ride, baby?
Need you right by my side, baby
Show 'em how to ride or die, baby
Hold me down, never lie, baby

[Verse 1: Jhonni Blaze]
I don't give a damn what they say

Don't ever test me, I got your back daddy, just say what you want

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
She can't take your spot, I won't let her try
Throw you hella guap, I keep you on top
Diamonds all she rock, diamonds in my watch
He run up, he get popped, watch his body drop
I’m juggin' of the block, she juggin' on the clock
Fuckin' around with my baby, you end up beheaded
Cruisin' in my Mercedes, baby, my seats is red
All headshots my nigga if you ain't get the message
I can't wait to put my hands on you baby
Let me show you all around the Zoo baby
I'm that nigga and you know it's true baby
You need me and I need you, baby
