[Verse 1]
She in the strip club fuck minimum wage
She gettin tip love from niggas that's paid
She throw that shit back for niggas to see it
I love her kickback, I swear she the G's
I fucked her good once, been fuckin her since
She always act like she in love and shit
Baby you be really in love with dick
I'm glad i'm the one that you want for now
I know how you get down and i'm lovin your style

[Chorus]
Let me be your nigga for the night, baby
Let me put this dick in your life, baby
Let's make a movie in the truck, baby
Show me how you don't give a fuck, baby

[Verse 2]
I got my gun on me but it's tucked, baby
I got bands on me but I've been up, yeah
That's his main bitch but i've been fuckin, yeah
I love it when you do your dance, baby
Love it when it's with no hands, baby
Always calling me your man, baby
Love it when I throw these bands, baby
She gon roll with me for the night, baby
I know what you need in your life, baby
Won't you come and see if it's right, baby
Ducking from the law running lights, baby

[Chorus x2]
Let me be your nigga for the night, baby
Let me put this dick in your life, baby
Show me how you don't give a fuck, baby
Let's make a movie in the truck, baby
