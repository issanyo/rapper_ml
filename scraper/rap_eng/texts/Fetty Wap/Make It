Squad

[Verse 1]
Remy Boyz, my niggas ready and shit
Next car I pull out might be a Chevy and shit
Linguini, extra pasta, that’s spaghetti and shit
C-coming through with automatics gunning the shit
My squad a bunch of bosses, we are running the shit
R-Remy Boyz or nothing, what you saying and shit
Disrespect my squad, I’ma spray ‘em and shit
F-Fetty Wap got it, then she saying the shit
I got the shit on smash, I ain’t playing and shit
Look, I could sing or I could rap, that’s my advantage and shit
Look, watch how I show off front of them cameras and shit
Ay, I’ma act like I ain’t got no manners and shit
Cause I ain’t never had a fancy ‘rari and shit
Look, bitches coming fresh from off a island and shit
E-Every time I hear my name, I start to wylin’ and shit
Ay, rookie off the bench, now I’m starting the shit
Everything a nigga on, I start to scoring and shit
Chicago Bulls, in '96, I'm Jordan and shit
I told NittDaGritt that we gon get the millions and shit
And you a motherfucking lie if you ain’t feeling the shit, Squad!

[Hook]
I promised all my niggas we gon make it

W-Watch the look on all these niggas faces
C-Coming through in the foreign like we raciiiiing

[Verse 2]
Fetty Cash my gotdamn name
From the trap, ain’t a damn thing changed
B-Bought my mother that brand new range
Showed my son a brand new way
And for my sisters, I just bought an AK
Let it spray, let it spray, let it spraaaay
And grandpa, for you I pray
Rest in peace Grandpa Jay
Vanessa rain on me or my sister
Rest in peace, two million for my nieces
And they twins, that’s a mil a piece man
Before you take me, answer please
Answer my prayers for me
Every night before I sleep
From you I ask of thee, fulfill my every needs
Watch for my family, guide me across these streets
And when it’s said and done
I’ll give you all of me

[Hook]
