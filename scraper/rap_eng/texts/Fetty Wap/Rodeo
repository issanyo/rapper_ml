[Hook: Mr. Wonder]
Shawty all that
Twerking for a nigga when he throwing stacks
I knew she want that and I knew it when
She jumped on the rodeoeo(2x)

[Verse 1: Kazzie Stoner]
Stoner, Uhh
Horny,  let's do it
Ridin my pony
My saddle was waiting so jump on it
Ass so fat I could put my cup on it
Tell me where you going girl
I could tell you where you need to be
You kissing on another girl
Some for you and some for me
Where my ladies from the East side, hey
What about the West side, hey
She got her man west style, aye
But she going down south now ,aye, aye, aye

[Bridge: Kazzie Stoner]
She got the body and money to play
The way that she twerkin im on it for days
Late night we on one we party til the sun up then after we finish and then we part ways

(Hook)

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Ayeee
On everything my niggas know I'm wildin
Bank bros RGF the island
Hella bands falling out my robins, aye
I had to act up if you talkin bands how you acts up
Still in the trap tryna get my cracks soft
Fucking hating, got my trap queen to let the mack off
Going everyday tryna get my packs off
I'm a goon for the work, niggas know I trap hard
I'm zoowap , I fuck any bitch that I want
We too hot we be burning down the whole club
We too hot oppers rollin up the whole time
She's too fine hit her once and I press rewind (2x)..yeahh baby
