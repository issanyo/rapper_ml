And I swear I'm tryna get some time to spare
Tryna show you how much I love you

I got most of these niggas all hatin'
Roll six in my Mercedes
And all these niggas off lately
Came up from nothing that’s crazy
ZooGang I swear they saved me
Drove my momma crazy
In the trap house is where they made me
I jugg all day and finesse it
I got Versace all on my neck
Can you jugg with a nigga baby, aye
Whip it good, make it finger lickin' baby
Wish he would try to take it from me
Couple slugs in his liver baby
Never miss, so deliver baby
I’m the best at this shit and she know it
Pop a half 'cet before we go in
ZooGang and they know that we rolling

Oh, these niggas be talkin' but ain’t who they claim to be
And every time you see me, know I got that thang with me
And every time you see me, know I got ZooGang with me
She came to the club with you, but then she came with me
I love the way you look, love the way you smell
Tell me how you feel, I'm just keeping it real
I just wanna chill, you look good in them heels
Sipping 17, I might let it spill
And shawty know I don't care, we could play Truth or Dare
I might fuck up your hair, don't be acting scared
It's the Zoo year, it's the Zoo year
Monty and Zoovier, Monty and Zoovier
