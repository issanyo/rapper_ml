[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah (thank you Fizzle)
Yeah, alright

[Chorus]
Money keep flippin' all the time, all the time, ay
Bitch I'm Bruce Wayne, I keep money on my mind
Countin' up, if you up, then it's fine, then it's fine, ay
Smash on these niggas, you can't take it when you die, ay
Money keep flippin' all the time, all the time, ay
Bitch I'm Bruce Wayne, I keep money on my mind
Countin' up, if you up, then it's fine, then it's fine, ay
Splash on these niggas, you can't take it when you die, ay

[Verse]
Splash nigga, I just spent 200 on a Audi
A fast car, duckin' 12, speedin' on the highway
Gang with me, fuck opps, we gon' do this our way
Playin' with me? We gon' breeze through his driveway
Hangin with me, rollin' weed like it's Friday
Doors on my car, they go up, they go sideways
Bon Appetit, let me eat, let me eat
Let a nigga know, is it beef, is it beef?
Somethin' in the air, Batman in the streets
Jordan 14's, Batman on my feet
Bitch I'm Bruce Wayne, stock's up, come and see
I put diamonds on my neck, and my watch cost a figure, yeah

[Chorus]
Money keep flippin' all the time, all the time, ay
Bitch I'm Bruce Wayne, I keep money on my mind
Countin' up, if you up, then it's fine, then it's fine, ay
Smash on these niggas, you can't take it when you die, ay
Money keep flippin' all the time, all the time, ay
Bitch I'm Bruce Wayne, I keep money on my mind
Countin' up, if you up, then it's fine, then it's fine, ay
Smash on these niggas, you can't take it when you die, ay
