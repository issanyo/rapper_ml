Knowledge (x16)
Fuck, Nigga

Intro (Fetty Wap)
Baby, won't you come my way?
Got something I want to say
Cannot keep you out my brain
But first off I'mma start by sayin' this, ayy
All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, ayy
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, ayy
Ba-Baby, won't you come my way?
Baby, won't you come my way?

Verse 1 (K.A.A.N)
I must confess that I stay depressed
I mean I live in hell next to the closest exit
No direction, I dissect it, so selective
Crazy what you motherfuckers do for possessions
I told em; I would kill a fallacy, but never try to lie
Cause I devise a different typa plan to make the strategy
I am actually tryna die, never really gave a fuck
I guarantee that I am at the bottom in the cumbersome
Of everything that you want to be believing in a person is definitely a mistake, I can see you niggas are faking
I bet that I'm finna make a fucking miracle, the spiritual
I said that it was something that people have never seen
I intervene with my intelligence, I know that I'm irrelevant
I swear that I've been saying that sentence from the beginning
I'm begging your fucking pardon, I promise to make a masterpiece
The problem I've been having is centered in sobriety
But quietly, I've never been contempt with the vision
The premonition of my death, no sleep in the PM
The man in the mirror the only nigga could be there, to be there, to see that
I can not take this shit, constantly thinking of ways I can end it
Suspending my confidence, now I'm incompetent
Pray for forgiveness of all of my sins
And I am lonely as ever
I hope it gets better

Baby, won't you come my way? (ay knowledge)
Got something I want to say
Cannot keep you out my brain
But first off I'mma start by sayin' this, ayy (You fucking, fucking)
All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, ayy (lawd)
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, ayy
