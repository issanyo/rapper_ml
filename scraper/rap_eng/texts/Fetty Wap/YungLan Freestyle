[Intro]
1738, Zoovier, Ay
I just wanna say what’s on my mind man

[Verse 1]
We designer down, rocking Fendi
Big chargers with the hemi
We pull up on ya’ll, nigga gimme
I make them honchos hit a semi
I’m talking mula, we got plenty
I fuck her best friend if she pretty
You know it’s ZooGang niggas with me
I let off two bangs to his kidney
Should take his baby momma out to Philly
Send the kids on trip to Walt Disney
I’ve yet to see a nigga ball with me
Monty and Dice standing tall with me
I collect the bands, then, hit the mall with ‘em
Wanna act up? Then, we all get ‘em
Wanna shoot? One shot, we all hit ‘em
Two doors, no top, it’s all missing
Niggas know how I rock, I’m all in
23 on my J, I’m Jordan
Niggas know how I rock, I’m all in
23 on my J, I’m Jordan
Heard these niggas hate me because that I’m a specialist
Diamonds know they on freeze, that’s how you know I’m flexing man
Remixing the whole thing, that’s how you get your paper up
First, you wasn’t on me but, now she wanna hang with us
Rolling off the molly, now she wanna skate with us
Before you try the ZooGang, suggest you try some angel dust
Monty shoot from long range, that’s how he let the hammer bust
AR15 but ya’ll bound to understand though
Shooting big guns, it cannot fit out the window
How the fuck you judge a nigga? Don’t know what he been through
Niggas don’t know me, might’ve seen me when I bend through
22 Forgiato sitting on the fen coupe
Zoovier, you won’t catch me without Monty
Last year, I told him this year was our time, then
I did what I said, now we all shining
Jumpmans for the kicks blue and our diamonds
Robins, go away Trues and I ain't lying
Two bands, one outfit, come on try me
I ain’t even touch the advance, I been bent up
Juggin and finessing at niggas, ain't getting jammed up
Robin wings on my Robin jeans hold my bands up
22nd, I’m a hooligan, I need a phantom
Bitches love me ‘cause I’m getting rich, I ain’t handsome
Get my niggas rich, talking foreigns and mansions, Squad!
