[Intro]
Yeah
21 Savage what up man

[Verse 1]
Zoovie too clean, you don't see the stain though, ay
Aliens got me so you know my chain glows, ay
Boxing niggas out and I don't need a ring though, ay
I got my own niggas what you tryna hang for, ay
Counted Zoovie out but I still remained strong, ay
Did it for my family then I put the gang on, ay
RGF the island finna turn the flame on, ay
Tryin' to get behind me, I had to switch lanes on the man
I don't fuck with niggas this is not a gang homie, ay
If you don't like me just don't say my name homie
If you with it then just pull up and just let it rain homie
If you do you better hit cause I'ma bring the rain homie
And the white-t on RG, put your name on it
Got a bad ass bitch, had to put my name on her
What I dropped on my 'Rari, dropped it on my chains homie
I don't talk, I don't speak, I just do my thing homie
If you bark, I'm gon' geek, know I got the aim homie
Try to knock out his teeth if I ain't got the thing on me
Got a thing for the street I can never change homie
Pimp in a red uniform, respect the game homie
