[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Used to be dark, I had no lights
Made a lot of wrongs to get it right
Feel like I was struggling all my life
Now it feels good to live like this

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
I'm talking bout fast cars, lot of bitches waiting on your car
Shit ain't nothing to me, everyday I'm fucking up the mall
She don't run to me she just want some nigga with some balls
And ain't nothing free, hope you know you paying for it all
Keep on testing me, I'ma keep praying for em all
And especially, for the ones who praying I'ma fall
And my specialty, Zoovier jugging all I do is ball
Check my recipe, mama told me always keep it tall
Checking me, baby I be mobbing till I ball
I'ma itchy boy, I'ma stay on going until I fall yeah
Made a couple million and I flipped it up
Diamonds on me glisten, see em from a far yeah

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Used to be dark, I had no lights
Made a lot of wrongs to get it right
Feel like I was struggling all my life
Now it feels good to live like this

[Verse 2: Duke]
Go and cop some diamonds just to piss em off
Real trap nigga I can get it all
Hop right on that PJ that bitch lifting off
I can get it going if it's hard or soft
I turned myself to a boss, tell a broke bitch to get lost
Cash out don't worry bout the cost
Play with the watch, you get off
Hop in the rari get lost, diamonds they looking like frost
I'm in her mouth like some floss
Geeked up, I'm high as a loft
I beat it up like a drum, [?] where you from
Bad bitches singing my song, walking around in my spot in a thong
I popped a egg, all of these bitches know what we on
Used to be broke now it's filet mignon

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Used to be dark, I had no lights
Made a lot of wrongs to get it right
Feel like I was struggling all my life
Now it feels good to live like this
