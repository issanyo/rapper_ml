[Intro]
Uh-na-na-na-yah
Mmh-yeah
Eh, eh, eh

[Hook]
Baby give me chills, she the realest that I ever had
She know money ain't a thing, we can flex, she sure into that
See you on the 'Gram, likin' pics on the internet (yeah)
Just a minute of your time, you gon' swear we was havin' sex
Baby give me chills, she the realest that I ever had
She know money ain't a thing, we can flex, says you into that
See you on the 'Gram, likin' pics on the internet (yeah)
Just a minute of your time, you gon' swear we was havin' sex

[Verse 1]
I just wanna show you I'm the man
Bust the moves, I'mma keep you in the plan
Really tryin' to make you understand
I only make time for what I want, say she into that
I need you around, honeys on my phone, but I love when you dial
Sippin' on the phone, keep the money in the pouch
She said I do it wrong but that's only when I'm saucy
Put you on my arm, matching jewels, get you frozen
Like the way I move, said that Zoovie real bossy
Had to slow it down, couple niggas thought they caught me
I'm only at the [?], see them girls, that's my world

[Bridge]
I been looking at your smile (this all for you)
I've been told you runnin' wild (missin' you)
We can smoke, take a ride (this is how we do)
Never change up my style, it's just me and you
I been looking at your smile (this all for you)
I've been told you runnin' wild (missin' you)
We can smoke, take a ride (this is how we do)
Never change up my style, it's just me and you (just me and you)

[Verse 2]
They just see us rollin' in the Benz now
I got money, ain't no place we can't go
Come here, let me change your bankroll
I'mma do my thing and then go
I'mma always keep it real, it's all for you baby
I had to move baby, I had to shoot, baby
For me and you baby, yeah-ah

[Outro]
Baby give me chills, she the realest that I ever had
Kept it real for me and you, yeah-ah
Baby give me chills, she the realest that I ever had
Me and you-ou
Baby give me chills, she the realest that I ever had
Me and you-ou
Baby give me chills, she the realest that I ever had
Kept it real for me and you
