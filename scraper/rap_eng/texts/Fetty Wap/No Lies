{Intro}
Frenzy on the muthafuckin beat
It’s that Loud Pack nigga
Frenzer
What’s up my boy boy

{Verse 1}
Beep beep, Issa foreign
All we do is fuck, bitch that’s borin
Half a million in a week when I’m tourin
Fuck her straight to sleep, now she snorin
She my lil freak when I’m whorin
Hit the buzzer beater when I’m scorin
Came in with your friends, call some more up
I came here in a Benz, color Pourah
Make him drop a level, shoot his floor up
Slam dunkin in the bank, run the score up
Love my Audi with the rings, start the car up
Hennessy, a couple wings, hit the bar up
Plus I keep a couple things, let em blow
Had a thing for the bling, let it go
Got a love for money, made it grow
It’s a way better feeling when it’s owned
Cartaways, started surfin, I was gone
For my day, it was Percys and Patrón
In my space tryna see what I be on
Imma kush smoker, weed is my cologne
Monster engine in my new Mercedes
Million dollars to the one who made me
I’m a product of the hood that raised me
I don’t look at hoes who try to play me
Free Merv man this shit is crazy
Free Kwab, takin care the babies
Free my brother Slick, we’ve been talkin lately
Lil Bor goin in and I ain’t see him lately
Me and LB on 1200
On the radio got the 12 jumpin
Whoop Whoop Skrt Skrt, 12 comin
When I pop a Perc, I feel nothin
.40 hold a lot, I’m still bustin
Red super, keep us still poppin
Countin money and I’m still rockin
That’s a hundred made it fill my pocket
