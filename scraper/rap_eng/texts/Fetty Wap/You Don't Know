[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
You don't know how much I really want you
And I like your style, how you walk and move
I got plenty cars, baby, you can choose
I be stuntin' hard, ain't nothing new
Had to slow it down and take my time with you
Every time when we be comin' 'round they move
You the one that's holding up the crown, ooh
Better be the one to hold me down, ooh
I know you like to smoke about a pound, ooh
Pull up with you, they won't make a sound, ooh
They don't like the fact that you're around, ooh
I swear I love the way you break it down, ooh
Always say the shit that make me smile, ooh
Baby I'ma always stay around, ooh
And I keep a lot of guns around, ooh
Big Wap keep a lot of funds around you

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]

[Verse 2: Sean Garrett]
Did you know I like to lick that pussy from the back down
I didn't know that you were so aggressive with the neck, yeah
I can dick you down, sixty minutes, straight flex, yeah
Let yo' girl eat it while it drips, she got next shell
Prerequisite, all my bad bitches are bisexual
Don't make 'em pick, make 'em share the dick and keep it natural
I'm so DD, I like RiRi, I don't fuck with nothing regular
Then the best type that let you fuck 'em in the strip club
Take a nigga bitch like he ain't shit
It ain't my fault if she love the dick
Ten years in and its still drip, drip
First swing of the game killt
First she told the girls she ain't like me
Then she told the nigga she ain't like me
For they straight stayed all night
Now a pussy nigga wanna fight
You don't know I run with nigga that don't play that
You don't know I got one that don't say that
She told me he ain't never fucked her right
So I fucked her, sucked her, yeah, I put that dick up in her life

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
You don't know how much I really want you and I know it
You don't know how much I'm tryna get a chance to show it
You don't know how much I got on me, I'm tryna blow it
You don't know, you don't know
You don't know, you don't know
You don't know how many times I see you in my dreams
You ain't even know that you my drug and I'm a fiend
You don't even know how bad I want you, baby
Baby I could take you where you want to baby
You don't know how much I really want you and I know it
You don't know how much I'm tryna get a chance to show it
You don't know how much I got on me, I'm tryna blow it
You don't know, you don't know
You don't know, you don't know
