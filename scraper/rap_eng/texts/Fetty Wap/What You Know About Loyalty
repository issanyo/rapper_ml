[Chorus: Albee Al]
What you know about loyalty?
What you know about it?
Said what you know about loyalty?
What you know about it?
I said I ride for my niggas, die for my niggas
Slide for my niggas, homicide for my niggas
Cry for my niggas, never lie to my niggas
If we ever go to jail, do the time for my niggas
What you know about it?

[Verse 1: Albee Al]
Ten toes, I stay ten toes
Neck froze and my wrist froze
Ain't got no carats in my earlobe
Just bought some carats for my main ho
Everywhere I go you know that thing go
And they see that chain glow, it shine like a rainbow
Catch me in that Range though, ain't fuckin' with no lames ho
No we ain't the same bro, I'm kickin' like I'm Kane though, you know about it
Know I'm 'bout my business
Want them to see me flexin' so I ain't timid
Bad bitch in it, we start it, we gon' finish
Let me ask you a question, you a shooter or a witness?
What you know about it?
All about the benjis, all about the benjis
Bad bitch with me, fuck her 'til she dizzy
Ain't 'posed to mix the Percocets with the Remy
But I feel like an animal when I got a milly

[Chorus: Albee Al]
What you know about loyalty?
What you know about it?
Said what you know about loyalty?
What you know about it?
I said I ride for my niggas, die for my niggas
Slide for my niggas, homicide for my niggas
Cry for my niggas, never lie to my niggas
If we ever go to jail, do the time for my niggas
What you know about it?

[Verse 2: Albee Al]
Chain swang like orangutan
Where I'm from we all gang bang
Just left the Tally with your main thing
See us and them, we ain't the same thing
I done seen your main bitch drooling
Who the fuck you foolin'? why they lettin' you in?
And it's like I'm goin' in, know I got that tool in
Watch how you movin', yeah, what you know about it?

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
Twenty million up, what you know about it?
Quarter ticket on my wrist, what you know 'bout it?
Super sexy and she thick, what you know 'bout it?
Make it rain all day, what you know 'bout it?
Hit the twelve with the gang 'til it's sold out
Black Charger with the hemi, hittin' old house
I ain't never ever tell, never sold out
Skinny nigga, never frail, I go four rounds
Gang gang, don't want none of my P's lil nigga
With the gladiator, only run with G's lil nigga
I don't fuck with you, you ain't never squeeze no trigger
Got a lot of hoes, never tried to please a nigga
Drinkin' by the liter, I think I'ma need a liver
Like a ball player, I can never leave my pivot
I'm a zoo god, pull up with the weed and liquor
On the gang boy, money made your boy a lil richer

[Chorus: Albee Al]
What you know about loyalty?
What you know about it?
Said what you know about loyalty?
What you know about it?
I said I ride for my niggas, die for my niggas
Slide for my niggas, homicide for my niggas
Cry for my niggas, never lie to my niggas
If we ever go to jail, do the time for my niggas
What you know about it?
