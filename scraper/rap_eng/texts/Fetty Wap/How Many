[Intro: Fetty Wap]
Zoovier
How many days? how many days?
Knowin' what I know now
And the trap said I'm back

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
What's the problem, 'cause nigga you ain't built like that
Make a lot of money, spend it, get it right back
Better have my money 'fore I shoot up his party
What the fuck he runnin' for, he said he was 'bout it
What's the problem, 'cause nigga you ain't built like that
Make a lot of money, spend it, get it right back
He better have my money 'fore I shoot up his party
What the fuck he runnin' for, he said he was 'bout it

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
How many days, we was juggin' on the block
How many days, they was tryna get us shot
How many days, we was comin' up with rocks
How many days, we was duckin' from the cops
How many days when we really felt like stars
How everybody whippin', we all had cars
In this bitch trippin', we all on Mars
How all the hoes geekin', they all off bars
How many days, I was posted on the twelve
How many days did I have to post a bail
How many days that they told me I would fail
I told 'em suck a dick, I told 'em go to hell
How many days I was juggin' off a scale
I never made a million in the trap so I failed
I made a couple mil off of rap, oh well
I would've made a bil knowin' what I know now
All my shooters like my [?], they gon' light up your party nigga
Pull up right behind you in my brand new Ferrari nigga
Swervin' on the [?] my bitch on a Harley nigga
They know I'm a go-getter, I stay gettin' dollars nigga
Sweat a couple Gucci shoes, Dolce Gabbana nigga
I ain't had no friends in school, now they surround a nigga
Bitches always come in two, can't stay from 'round 'em nigga
All my niggas kneel with me, always a pride of niggas
All my niggas stay with fifty when it's a crowd of niggas
Most my niggas keep a glizzy, clear out the crowd lil quicker
Told them niggas get up with me, got up and now we richer
All my niggas in the field baby, and I'm the pitcher

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
What's the problem, 'cause nigga you ain't built like that
Make a lot of money, spend it, get it right back
Better have my money 'fore I shoot up his party
What the fuck he runnin' for, he said he was 'bout it
What's the problem, 'cause nigga you ain't built like that
Make a lot of money, spend it, get it right back
He better have my money 'fore I shoot up his party
What the fuck he runnin' for, he said he was 'bout it

[Verse 2: Snap Dogg]
How many times that I had to use the K
Niggas talkin' crazy, had to put 'em in they place
I can have them goons come and get you where you stay
Tryna run off with my bread, I'ma shoot him in his face
What's the problem nigga, you don't want no smoke
No I ain't no joke, I can touch your folks
Homie quit the tough act, you ain't layin' like that
Keep on talkin' real crazy, I'ma be in all black
Spent a few bands, it's all blues in my hands
Hit the mall, I blow some racks, bet it all, I make it back
How you niggas want smoke and you don't own a strap?
Put ten on they head, yeah I want 'em all whacked
Young nigga, I just drill shit, don't need no pill bitch
Streets behind me 'cause they know a nigga spit that real shit
I ain't gotta use the pistol, bet he catch these hands quick
Niggas always talkin' crazy, when they see me, ain't sayin' shit
