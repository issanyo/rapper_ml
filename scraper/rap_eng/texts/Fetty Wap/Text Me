[Intro: Fetty Wap]
You can text me in the
You can text me in the
You can text me in the

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
You can text me in the AM or text me in the PM
I keep a lot of girls who I hit up when I need 'em
But baby you can text me
Somethin' 'bout you really got me going
You was sexy, be crazy if you left me
You can text me in the AM or text me in the PM
I keep a lot of girls who I hit up when I need 'em
But baby you can text me
Somethin' 'bout you you really got me going
You was sexy, be crazy if you left me, yeah

[Verse 1: Monty]
You can text me in the AM or text me in the PM
Last nigga that you had, yeah, I'd hate to be him
Everyday a party, niggas feelin' like a rerun
Bottle after bottle, that's the type of shit we be on
Baby you can text me, just don't ever sweat me
Just don't say you not gon' leave and then you left me
Pull up to yo' address, baby get you ass dressed
If you got a nigga, you know I can get you passed that
Started in yo' DM
Got a lot of bitches, I'ma see 'em when I see 'em
I can take you on a shoppin' spree up in Neiman's
I might hit the road switchin' hoes like the seasons

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
You can text me in the AM or text me in the PM
I keep a lot of girls who I hit up when I need 'em
But baby you can text me
Somethin' 'bout you really got me going
You was sexy, be crazy if you left me
You can text me in the AM or text me in the PM
I keep a lot of girls who I hit up when I need 'em
But baby you can text me
Somethin' 'bout you you really got me going
You was sexy, be crazy if you left me, yeah

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
You can text me in the AM, baby
You can text me and stop playin', baby
I swear you so sexy, baby
And I like yo' body, baby
Yeah, and kick it like karate, baby
Yeah, and two of us, let's party, baby
Yeah, and top down in my 'rari, baby
Yeah, and, and I know you like me, baby
Yeah, and know I drive you crazy, too
Sorry, this is what I do
Money flow for me and you
Money on a lot of jewels
I come from on the streets, that's true
You was there for me, that's you
Got a brand new whip, that's you
Got a lot of bags, that's you
Lovin' on a bottle of Ros√©
I'ma show you how I do it
Baby, there's no point of shootin'
Money movin' with the groove
Watch this how we comin' through
Foreigns, that's a lot of coupes
Watchin' for my niggas shootin'
Money gettin' niggas [?]

[Outro: Fetty Wap]
Aye
Baby
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
