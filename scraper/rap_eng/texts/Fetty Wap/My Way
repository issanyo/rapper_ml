[Hook: Fetty Wap & Spiff M3ylor]
Baby, won't you come my way?
Got something I want to say
Cannot keep you out my brain
But first off I'm gonna start by saying this, ayy
All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, ayy
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, ayy
Ba-Baby, won't you come my way?
Baby, won't you come my way?

[Verse One: Spiff M3ylor]
We ain't the coolest ones but we find our way through it, (Aye)
I did a lot of things I hate to impress a chick
But I'm sick-of giving fucks
A Nigga's giving up
I never really even quit when it's getting tough
But I done had enough
I'm bout' to pack it up
And I'm sick (sick)
And I'm tired (snore)
And I'm sick (sick)
Sick Of liars
Pick a flyer
Get a choir
Don't be quiet now that you cross into the new light
Only want the best for my ex cuz' the way you actin it's gonna be a hell of a show tonight
I ain't fighting
For nobody no more
I done passed this rad bolt of lightning
I can no longer go any longer
Please give the fucking mic to my hype-man
I can tell you I've been dealing with no good broads for as long as I have been writing
Seeing them now don't even excite me, hey
Feeling shitty homie' can I bum that j?


[Hook]


[Verse Two: Spiff]
I give no fuck about hoes now
I'm done chasing these through the town
Thought I found- no she is just another one who only give a fuck that I got talent
Twisted balance
Like accountants
If I'm shinning something gonna go shit soon
Locked in my room
I'm thinking bout being a goon and entering holes in medullas
What if I wear to move packs would I get more racks than from rap?
Niggas who strapped either get hella' time or respect
Don't dap me you actually don't really give a shit
Fuck a Ashley, a Cathy, I have no bae
All they want is a nigga sending tears down they face
I can do that
I'll prove that
If you move that
Boo Don't bat
Them fake eyelashes
Make up your mind for I lash at your boy and remove his spine
Shoot out his lights and waste his time
Pull the plug in the hospital he won't survive
And I'm hoping you die
There's no more being kind
Just take your flow and just make that bitch mine
I can spit to that girl and just make that chick mine
Under no light unless that bitch is lime

[Hook]


[Outro: Spiff M3ylor]
Baby won't you come my way
Got something I want to spray
Put it in your boyfriend's face
Now I'm serving 5 to 8
