[Verse 1: Jose Guapo]
Fuck a worker be a boss
Young Guapo ain't taking no loss
This foreign came with exhaust, I hop out and Giuseppe walk
Guapo ain't saving no bitch, I rather go hit me a lick
I use to be broke in 06, but I haven't been broke ever since
I might send an assist on my land, I might fuck your hoe in a Benz
I’m having a rackys lil nigga, don't get your ass wetted lil nigga
Fuck around and run it up, so much money, Brink’s truck
So many bitches to fuck
All of this drank, pour up

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Ayy, thumb through the hundreds, keep going
Ayy, I get the money and blow it
Ayy, my bitch is so bad and I know it
Ayy, these niggas be tryna explore it
Ayy, 150 in cash for it
Zoovier be making it splash on ‘em
Niggas can’t do that, they know it, ayy
And I just did forty shows, ayy
The shows worth a million to blow, ayy
Fuck around and run it up, ayy
Fuck a nigga talking to?, ayy
Run up on me, see what’s up, ayy
Was really raised out the slums, ayy
I got it all on my own, ayy
I dropped a mil' on a home, ayy
Broke nigga going on, ayy
Correct a nigga if he wrong, ayy
Face to face, talking phones, ayy
I really trapped where I stayed at
And I really lived where the Js at
Disrespect, we ain't play that
My niggas will run in your home, ayy
Take everything that you own, ayy
Now we the bosses, you the runner
