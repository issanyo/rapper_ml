[Intro]
Ooo, uh
Yeah, yeah
That boy Cassius

[Chorus]
Tell her she could bring her friends too (she could bring her friends)
Baby, that's the thing that friends do (baby, that's the thing that friends)
Why you bringin' one? Go bring two (why you bringin' one? Go bring)
I ain't have a drink, I had a few (I ain't have a drink, I had)
Tell her she could bring her friends too (tell her she could bring her friends)
Baby, that's the thing that friends do (baby, that's the thing that friends)
Why you bringin' one? Go bring two (why you bringin' one? Go bring)
I ain't have a drink, I had a few (yeah, yeah)

[Verse]
You don't whippin', shippin', might swerve with my baby
When you wrap it, then look different, tight curves little baby
On the block, I used to pitch it bright early, little baby
For the money, I was trippin' but that pussy drive me crazy (yeah baby)
I'ma act up when I hit it, I'ma act out if you play me
Pull your weave out if you with it, pull your weave out if you weigh (pull your weave out if you weigh)
When we fucked and say you love me, what we don't know, look my way (what we don't know, look my way)
I'm so used to gettin' money, I be ballin' every day (I be ballin' every day)
Even let you roll my weed too (let you roll my weed)
Never hit a lick but we coo
I'm that nigga, check out these jewels (I'm that nigga, check out these)
Street sweeper, then I freeze you (Street sweeper, then I freeze)

[Chorus]
Tell her she could bring her friends too (tell her she bring could a friend)
Baby, that's the thing that friends do (baby, that's the thing that friends)
Why you bringin' one? Go bring two (why you bringin' one? Go bring)
I ain't have a drink, I had a few (I ain't have a drink, I had)
Tell her she could bring her friends too (tell her she could bring her friends)
Baby, that's the thing that friends do (baby, that's the thing that friends)
Why you bringin' one? Go bring two (why you bringin' one? Go bring)
I ain't have a drink, I had a few (yeah)
