[Hook]
You ain't got no crack, crack, pills, pills
Dope, dope, and weed
And the cash make 'em twerk
Suck, suck, spit, spit, and nut, nut
Do drugs then we murk, murder, hommy
187, call your mommy
And we got it out the kurb, kurb
The crib, the 8, go we, the 8, ball, ball

[Verse 1]
Nigga you ain't got it
She get to twerking if she spot it
Throw that bitch a new shoe then we spying
Anybody's drop, we never mind 'em
Shout out my nigga Mitch, that's how we grinding
[?] stack it up, the feds won't find me
[?] how we shining
On the ball, how we grinding
Time is money, perfect timing
Nigga watch the timing
I see you keep on lying
Your whole life, you been lying

[Hook]
You ain't got no crack, crack, pills, pills
Dope, dope, and weed
And the cash make 'em twerk
Suck, suck, spit, spit, and nut, nut
Do drugs then we murk, murder, hommy
187, call your mommy
And we got it out the kurb, kurb
The crib, the 8, go we, the 8, ball, ball

[Verse 2]
Disrespect the 3, pussy, I'm gon' find you
Got some niggas on the 8 and they grind too
And if they get the word, they gon' come and find you
I been from the 3 since [?] was selling goop
Late nights on the porch and I got the pour
Fast bitch get it up and you better blow
These niggas hating and I swear to God I know
I been from the 3 so you know my ass I show
Your bitch just got word, now it's time to hoe
And if she fuck me then you know she gotta fuck my bro
Grab your pants and your shit, bitch it's time to go
Hit the trap, late night, jugging by the stove

[Hook]
You ain't got no crack, crack, pills, pills
Dope, dope, and weed
And the cash make 'em twerk
Suck, suck, spit, spit, and nut, nut
Do drugs then we murk, murder, hommy
187, call your mommy
And we got it out the kurb, kurb
The crib, the 8, go we, the 8, ball, ball

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
You ain't got no weed, ain't got no pussy, ain't got no trap
You ain't talk no bands, ain't talk to stacks, ain't talk no racks
Got a big ass gun, if I pull it up then she go blah
If I call her cunt, that nigga pop with the mac
Ay, 20 second on the world, that's all I know
Late night in the kitchen, water whipping blow
All juggers ass, rack it 'fore I kick his door
17 shots, right before I stop this hoe
Ay, jugger finessing niggas know how hard I go
Twelfth a second, nigga know how to roll
All I know is getting bands then I get some more
Late night in the trap tryna get it all

[Hook]
You ain't got no crack, crack, pills, pills
Dope, dope, and weed
And the cash make 'em twerk
Suck, suck, spit, spit, and nut, nut
Do drugs then we murk, murder, hommy
187, call your mommy
And we got it out the kurb, kurb
The crib, the 8, go we, the 8, ball, ball
