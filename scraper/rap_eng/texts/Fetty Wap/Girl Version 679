Yeah baby
Tiffany Chantelle with a  remix with a remix
Look, i ain't gonna like you to damn fine though
But think its good so please be mine though
Its only a matter of time though
Before you want to jump in my ride though
I know it depends where you got it
Benjamins all in your pocket
But is that all that we're talking?
Cause you're the dude that i want it
You gotta bish on your arm...
But imma take her place...
Another bish on your arm...
And you don't even know her name


[hook; Tiffany]
Yeah he's fine
Wonder if he'll be mine
Walk pass I press rewind
So i can see him one more time
And i know he knows this
All them hoes they want him
Can't get enough of what he got in
[?]
Uhm, yeah baby

[Tiffany]
Your money ain't what I see
I just want you to want me
We can even keep this shit low key
Whatever you want there ain't no fee
'cause i know what you got in so,  ain't no joke
I keep it cool
As Long as you can keep it real, just know why i so ain't no fool
Cause i want you
And i know you want me too
Say it i want you
And i know you want me too
Now go play em'
All those hoes you can play them
But  yall know that i'm the one
You 'bout to see what he wants

[Hook;Tiffany]
I'm like "Yeah he's fine."
Wonder if he'll be mine
Walk pass i press rewind
So i'll see him one more time
But i know he knows this
All the hoes they want him
Can't get enough of what he got in
