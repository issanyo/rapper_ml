[Intro: Monty]
Free JK, man
We love [?]

[Verse 1: Monty]
Suck a freak, I was tryin' get the cake
Hunnid deep, we gon' pull up to ya place
Fuck a week, I be ballin' every day
Fuck the cheese, I be tryin' get the face
In the kitchen water whippin' in the [?]
Lotta' money, Lotta' hoes, Lotta' hate
Pockets swoll', lotta' shows, different states
Used ride in the trappy with no plates
I ain't have it then, but bitch I got it now
Shout out [?] make them dance, Bobby Brown
Pew, pew, pew, pew
Love that gun sound
Talkin' shit, just gon' get you gunned down
Ho its Zoovie I don't think you want no action
You ain't trappin' no, nigga you be cappin'
We was down we was tryna' make it happen
Hoes in the four door get the lappin'
You ain't on my level you ain't on my bracket
Man that nigga dead put him in the casket
I just spent 5k on a jacket
And I still like my bitch a lil' ratchet

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
I know you pussies talkin' bout me very day
Fuck a beef nigga this ain't bout a chain
If you a smoke why you ain't let it spray
If I'ma joke why you ain't come to play
Niggas talkin' big 40s every day
Call his bitch big shawty on my waist
Now this nigga goin' down, come outside
Catch me on the 12 I don't ever hide
How you a gangsta if you motherfuckin' 2
Boy stop playin' you too motherfuckin' old
Ay I bet you wish you made better decisions
You lil' bitch
I ain't say nothin' you was playin' the victim
You lil' bitch
Itchy boys I don't fall under pressure
The first million that I saw invest
Ay playin' chess but my couple was checkers
Ay on the jet tell this nigga to catch up
Fuck a [?} put the lawyers on the case
Bitch you too weak so I ain't kicked it with my gang
Ay and my bro ain't say no motherfuckin' names
Free my bros off the motherfuckin' cage
Shit be crazy feel like I ain't never change
Quad told me get this guap while you can
Niggas wanna' see Wap in the jail
Ay I'm twelve hunnid you can see it in my face
