[Chorus]
Don't know what to do with you baby
I put you in expensive Choo's baby
You could pick a car to cruise baby
Have you screaming loud, ooh baby
Don't know what to do with you baby
I put you in expensive Choo's baby
You could pick a car to cruise baby
Have you screaming loud, ooh baby

[Verse]
Show you what to do, baby you don't waste my time babe
I can take a clue, just keep it true and never lie babe
I'ma show you love when you in the club, I ain't tryna hide babe
Can we take a pic, girl you on my gram so I'm not your mind babe
Bring you to the strips, show you how it is, I'm from the town
Niggas gettin' rich, feel my nigga rick about to sound
Diamonds on your wrist and on your neck 'cause you fine as hell
Finally show your team like oh my god
You should see all the money I spent on brand new rocks
And I dropped all the girls, had to make you mine
You said give you a reason, I had to give you five
Now give me a reason I should make you mine, yeah baby

[Chorus]
Don't know what to do with you baby
I put you in expensive Choo's baby
You could pick a car to cruise baby
Have you screaming loud, ooh baby
Don't know what to do with you baby
I put you in expensive Choo's baby
You could pick a car to cruise baby
Have you screaming loud, ooh baby

[Outro]
Don't know what to do with you
Put you in expensive Choo's
