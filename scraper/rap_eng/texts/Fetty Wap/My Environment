1738
Just speakin' my mind man (Zoovie)

[Verse 1]
Either you with us or against us that's just the way it is
I'm sick of niggas talkin' all crazy like I ain't with the shits
I just bought my 10th Mercedes I love the AMGs
And I dropped 1.2 for the crib where I lay at
'Member had to sleep in the house where the J's at
Been gettin' bitches and this money, we ain't play that
You can ask any damn bitch where I stayed at
Shoutout to my hood, 1200 Harlem World, ayy
22nd block, ayy
Servin' party packs, ayy
Make the party rock, ayy
We some young gang bangers makin' a lot of guap, ayy
Never love a thot, ayy
Screamin' fuck the opps, ayy
Hit me when it drop, ayy
I be sonnin' niggas, man I shoulda been they pops, ayy
Hope this nigga know it's on sight when I see 'em
I don't want talkin', I don't wanna be friends
Swerve through the strip with this bitch on some G shit, ayy

[Hook]
And this is for my young niggas, ayy
Cause of where we from all we know is our environment
And you can't change what's understood, ayy
And if it's all good then it's all good, I'ma rep my hood, ayy
Real niggas they know what I mean, ayy
Everyday the only mission, gotta stack the green
A couple million for my children, gotta get the cream
I turned a thousand to a million, started with a dream, hey

[Verse 2]
And most these niggas say I sing too much and
I don't really show up my bling too much and
I don't really show off my cars too much and
I don't really be with the stars that much and
I don't like to kick it with such and such and
These niggas like bitches, they talk too much
They tryna be just like you, they stalk too much
And bitch you can swerve with the Zoo on the weekend
Fifth of Patron and we gone and we freakin'
Bitch super wet, make her squirt when I'm deep in
Makin' her moan and my name what she screamin'
Wap with the bands, Poppa Smurf start to tweakin'
Jump in my six so fast, tires screechin'
Everything blessed, I could ball for no reason
Hop on the jet, start to glide through the season
In it for a while but they do not believe 'em why

[Hook]
I do this is for my young niggas, ayy
Cause of where we from all we know is our environment
And you can't change what's understood, ayy
And if it's all good then it's all good, I'ma rep my hood, ayy
Real niggas they know what I mean, ayy
Everyday the only mission, gotta stack the green
A couple million for my children, gotta get the cream
I turned a thousand to a million, started with a dream, woah

[Bridge]
Ayy, this is for my young niggas
I do this for my young niggas
Gotta get the cream
Started with a dollar, turned it to a dream

[Hook]
And this is for my young niggas
Cause of where we from all we know is our environment
And you can't change what's understood
Man, cause if it's all good then it's all good
We gon' rep the hood
Man them real niggas they know what I mean
Everyday the only mission, gotta stack the green
A couple million for my children, gotta get the cream
I turned a dollar to a million, started with a dream, woah

[Outro]
RGF, welcome to the fuckin' Island man
Fetty Wap part 2 man
Or whatever we gon' call this shit man
Ayy Frenzy, RGF frontman
What the fuck they talkin' bout man?
Big diamonds man, everybody chain swangin' man, woah
