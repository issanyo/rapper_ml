Yeah baby
Oohhh
ZooVier, 1738

[Hook]
I am so stuck in my ways, baby
Ain't givin' it up, ayy
This money I get it for days, baby
I can't get enough, ayy
These niggas just mad that I’m paid, baby
I don’t give a fuck, ayy
I am so stuck in my ways, money I get it for days
Niggas just mad that I'm...
I am just stuck in my ways, baby
I ain't givin' it up, ayy
This money I get it for days, baby
I can't get enough, ayy
These niggas just mad that I’m paid, baby
I don’t give a fuck, ayy
I am so stuck in my ways, money I get it for days
Niggas just mad that I'm paid

[Verse 1]
Flippin' work, like a pissy mattress
Always front flip, never back flip
All this money that we gettin', ayy
Baptized in my kitchen, ayy
I was blessed with the chickens, ayy
If you ain't bout it, good riddance, ayy
I know I'm hurtin' suckas feelings, ayy
ZooGods we the realest, ayy
Cold world like the chillest, ayy
Scorch your eye like a skillet, ayy
I'll be there in two minutes, ayy
Call that a Bentley, you trippin', ayy
I might fuck his new bitch, ayy
Kick it round real quick, ayy
I'm layin' on the good whip, ayy
ZooVie Zoo, I'm a pimp, ayy
Red uniforms and shit, ayy
Can you afford a brick? ayy
Hundred thousands up in sales, ayy
Cause I'm eatin' very well, baby
Havin' money, can't you tell, baby?
Curse to it like a spell, baby
So many opps, so many feds, baby
Check a nigga poppin' bands, baby
Trackin' niggas through the trail, baby
Pussy niggas always tell, baby
Real niggas all in jail, baby
Come on, get back to the money, ayy
These niggas just mad that I'm up, baby
ZooVie, I don't give a fuck, baby
Niggas just mad that I'm up, baby
Said ZooVie, I don't give a fuck, baby

[Hook]
I am so stuck in my ways, baby
Ain't givin' it up, ayy
This money I get it for days, baby
I can't get enough, ayy
These niggas just mad that I’m paid, baby
I don’t give a fuck, ayy
I am so stuck in my ways, money I get it for days
Niggas just mad that I'm...
I am just stuck in my ways, baby
I ain't givin' it up, ayy
This money I get it for days, baby
I can't get enough, ayy
These niggas just mad that I’m paid, baby
I don’t give a fuck, ayy
I am so stuck in my ways, money I get it for days
Niggas just mad that I'm paid

[Outro]
Whoa

Yeah, baby, 1738
Ain't givin' it up

I am so stuck in my ways baby
Ayy, Monty, come back man
