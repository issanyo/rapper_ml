We have dreams of this day, now the streets going cray

Niggas know I don’t play, have some hoes on delay
They be head over heels, give me head in the wheels
I got bread, I got bills and your legs I could feel
In the back of the ride, from the back or the side
In the trap counting racks, throw it back if you like, baby
Uh, me and my niggas tryna make it, baby
I’m just tryna see if you can take it, baby
I’ma throw this money while you shake it, baby
And you can get it now, ain’t no waiting, baby
