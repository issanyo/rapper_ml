[Intro]
Ay, yeaaah baby
ZooZoo, Zoovier! Squad! Ay

[Verse 1]
I pull up in my beamer, hop out and start to flexing
Used to stay in the trap house, was serving fiends their breakfast
All I do is count money, my lil brother stretch it
Don’t get shit on my hands now, my shit’s too fucking special
Big ZooWap from the bando, I’m sending you a message
Everything that I land on, I swear to God I smash it
And my whole damn camp on, I heat it up and pass it
Every beat that I Wap on, I put it in a casket
Hit the gas on my spaceship, I hate waiting in traffic
Like they all at a standstill, watch ZooWap fucking pass ‘em
Khaos pull out that forty, he doing too much yapping
I am GMOB, we folk can get it cracking
How you stand on your block without your pistol, boy you lacking
Pillow talk to them bitches bout me, boy I find out faster
How you stand on your block without your pistol, boy you lacking
Pillow talk to them bitches bout me, I find out faster, ay

[Verse 2]
Bands all in my Robin jeans, niggas tryna rob me
Fuck nigga better duck ‘fore I get the tommy
Riding in the drop top with a mami
Hundred bands I’ma drop soon on my time piece
Tints all on my beamer boy, ZooWap I’m so special
Came up off of nothing, now it’s money in my dresser
Only jeans I rock got wings, five hundred just to dress up
Stupid loud in the woods, ZooWap roll it faster
Had to check my fucking six, I floor it, it go faster
ZooWap from the trap, I swear my sack is a disaster
Different color twelve, twelve skinnies in a plastic
You gon' need a fucking phantom if you tryna match it
Gritt and Dice on twenty-eight, trapping out the mansion
Old school days, Box Chevy for my grandma
All I wanna do is whip, put ZooWap on the landmark
Thru these streets I’m movin' quick like big ZooWap a landshark
Talking shit, can’t leave your block
That’s how you get your land marked
Heavy cheese, my neck gon' freeze and Gucci Mane my role model
Every time I hit the club, we pop at least ‘bout four bottles
Every time we leave the club, you see all the hoes follow
If that nigga acting crazy, he gon' get the whole hollow
ZooWap, I don’t give a fuck, got sympathy for nobody
All they gotta do is cut the check, I go get four Robins
ZooWap I’m the motherfucking best, compared to nobody
Laser tips will beam you up but baby we don’t know Scotty
ZooWap I’m the motherfucking best, compared to nobody
All they gotta do is cut the check, I go get four Robins
Laser tips will beam you up but baby we don’t know Scotty, Squad!
