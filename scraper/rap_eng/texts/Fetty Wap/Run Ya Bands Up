She just wanna suck on my dick
Cause she see a nigga rich
Man these hoes ain't shit

Thirty bands yeah they on me

So don't approach me like you know me
They be shooting like Ginobili, they be shooting niggas OD
That's why I don't need security, nigga get smoked before you get near me
All I do is smoke that dope, that shit you smoke I can't hear that shit barely
I did this all on my own, last year I was broke, ain't shit you can tell me

Balmains with the Yeezys
And my neck on frostbite

Loso Loaded never needed a pistol
I just came through in a foreign, I ain't fucking her she boring
Loso Loaded I be up in the morning, broke niggas they be yawing

She got that sloppy she top me up
I got that box and I fill it up
We make the trends and they copy us
I drop the top and I'm doing that dance, I feel like I'm living too fast
Grind the whip and it got two on the dash outside the racks in the bag
Fifteen-hundred on the pouch and the belt
I got sneakers that ain't out on the shelves
Broke bitch acting so fucking thirsty, make a youngin' turn into Michael Phelps
I just pulled up in a foreign, she like damn Loso
I just poured up a four inside a damn Faygo
Now I'm fucking up the juice, I ain't smoking on a fruit
Real niggas I recruit, Loso Loaded on the truth
