[Hook: Fetty Wap]
My niggas stack their money just to spend it
Cause when you die you cannot take it with you
If you ain't beefin' 'bout the money, then what's the problem?
Don't worry about my niggas cause I got 'em
My niggas stack their money just to spend it
Cause when you die you cannot take it with you
And if you ain't beefin' 'bout no money, then what's the problem?
Don't worry about my niggas, ZooWap got 'em

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
On everything, for 17 I'm wildin'
Treat my whole squad on an island
Ziploc gang, bring a lighter
It's gon' be a house party on this island
Shit boom like M80s on this island
It's a lot of trillionaires throwin' dollars
Causin' pure hell, wildin' out on this island
I do this too swell, my pockets too swell
Come try the 100 gang, man they'll shoot ya
I do this for my squad, I do this for my gang
I do this for my squad, I do this for my gang
It’s Zoovier from the trap and ain't a damn thing change

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
My niggas stack their money just to spend it
Cause when you die you cannot take it with you
If you ain't beefin' 'bout the money, then what's the problem?
Don't worry about my niggas cause I got 'em
My niggas stack their money just to spend it
Cause when you die you cannot take it with you
And if you ain't beefin' 'bout no money, then what's the problem?
Don't worry about my niggas, ZooWap got 'em

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Ay, when I didn’t have a penny, all I thought about was a dollar
Ay, and I ain’t worried about no nigga ‘cause they ain’t solving my problems
Ay, and if you know me and my niggas then you know damn right I got ‘em
G herbal came from the bottom, shooting and trapping and robbing
Now I got commas, catch me and my killers mobbing
Drinking Rosay out the bottles, Louis, no Prada
I get so fly like a rocket, spent 20k on my Robins
Boy, what’s the problem? I get so high that’s my problem
Deuces and fours in my Fanta ride, with them choppers
FN thirty poppers, AR-15 go grraa grraa
I can’t wait ‘til I beat my case, I’mma leave the U.S and go stay on the island
At the end of the day, know you blessed
Can attest, you sweared I be stressing not smiling
You fuck niggas bad for my health
So I stay to myself with that Wesson beside me
Dedicating this year to my family, fuck all the haters I left them behind me
I the city, know my niggas grimey, stay in the hood, just pull up you will find me
Leave ‘em all in a mess, with your traffic, we sliding
Lurking and ducking no action
Living life and I know I can’t die with this Dos on it’s one of the reasons I’m cashing
And another ‘cause I’m from the streets and young niggas like Fetty and me never had it

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
My niggas stack their money just to spend it
Cause when you die you cannot take it with you
If you ain't beefin' 'bout the money, then what's the problem?
Don't worry about my niggas cause I got 'em

Cause when you die you cannot take it with you
And if you ain't beefin' 'bout no money, then what's the problem?
Don't worry about my niggas, ZooWap got 'em

[Verse 3: Albee Al]
I’m in the gang that hold ten shooters
Pray nobody in the team Judas (please)
No we ain’t scared the whole team do this
Loading choppers and loading Rugers
Bang, bang, bang nigga, touch mine and I start wildin’
Shots fired they start dyin’
Bad dreams and my heart pounding
You pussy niggas stay fuckin around
Be bodied I’m still wild
Ask me how I feel about them
I tell you “ain’t nothing real about them”
They pussy nigga, stay around if I see a bitch
Fish Bow you see me bitch
Just came home and you see me lit
Die for every nigga you see me wit’
See I been in all kind of beef
Fucking up my mama's sleep
Easy on them it’s time to eat
I am who you tryna be
