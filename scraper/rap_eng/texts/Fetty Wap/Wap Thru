[Verse One: Fetty Wapp]
I be yelling out squad when I walk thru
Got some bitches outside toting guns too
Throwing up gang sign cause we want to
Hella bands, hella guap How I come thru
NittTheGritt said "stunt how I want to"
Engine in the back trunk in the front too
Hollow tips, bullets in ya front tooth
Drill shit, bullets in ya new coop
Feel this Fetty Wap is so cool
Young nigga leader of the new school
Robins, traded in my old trues
6's sitting on the new scoop
I'd done walked in with jays on my feet
Hold back on wedges come and roll up my weed
Remy and bali they know how it is
Bad boys and bitches they all came for me
People are watching me just like T.V
Remy Boy Wap, give them something to see
Remy Boys up watch when we hit T.V
3 of us sold us a million a piece
