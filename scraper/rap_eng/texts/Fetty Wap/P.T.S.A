[Chorus]
Don't know what I do for you baby
She just be like baby you crazy
I just be like this what you made me
Swear I'm only up for you
She just look like nigga don't play me
Tell me anything but don't save me
Baby I'ma lie to you, sorry this is what I do
Don't know what I do for you baby
She just be like baby you crazy
I just be like this what you made me
Swear I'm only up for you
Don't know what I do for you baby
She just be like baby you crazy
I just be like this what you made me
Swear I'm only up for you

[Verse 1]
I'ma seek my girl and go crazy
I'ma spend a lot I'm not lazy
Always keep a 9 on me, baby
Keep a 50 shot with me, baby
He think he can rock with me, baby
Shoot him in the block with me, baby
Pull up on this block for free, baby
Tell me who is stoppin me, baby
Fetty I'm a young OG, baby
Foreign I can be lowkey, baby
Everybody notice me, baby
Singin' like I'm Jodeci, baby
Runnin' when I see police, baby
Servin' I'ma text a fee, baby
And I'm really from the streets, baby
Still move with a 33, baby

[Chorus]
Don't know what I do for you baby
She just be like baby you crazy
I just be like this what you made me
Swear I'm only up for you
She just look like nigga don't play me
Tell me anything but don't save me
Baby I'ma lie to you, sorry this is what I do
Don't know what I do for you baby
She just be like baby you crazy
I just be like this what you made me
Swear I'm only up for you
Don't know what I do for you baby
She just be like baby you crazy
I just be like this what you made me
Swear I'm only up for you
