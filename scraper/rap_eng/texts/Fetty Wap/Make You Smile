I just wanna make you smile, baby, ayy
Take a ride, talk for a while, baby, ayy

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
I just wanna make you smile, baby
Take a ride, and talk for a while
And I promise it won't take too long
And I swear I won't treat you wrong, baby
I just wanna see you, baby

Take a ride, and talk for a while
And I promise it won't take too long
And I swear I won't treat you wrong, baby

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
I bought everything but a watch
Cause I like the time, cause it stop
And I spend my time with you, baby
Wanna spend it all with you, baby
Tryna spend it all on you, baby
Put you in that foreign coupe, baby

Zoo Gang we a foreign crew, baby
Girl you know I need you, ayy
And I'd drop to my knees too
You know this song can do anything to please you

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
I just wanna make you smile, baby
Take a ride, and talk for a while
And I promise it won't take too long
And I swear I won't treat you wrong, baby
I just wanna see you, baby
I just wanna see you, baby
I just wanna make you smile, baby
Take a ride, and talk for a while
And I promise it won't take too long
And I swear I won't treat you wrong, baby
I just wanna see you, baby

[Verse 2: Bleek Blaze]
Yeah girl you know I pull up on you anytime
Tryna stretch you out, like we 'bout to cross the finish line
Looking for that long strech, well you know I finish mine
Hustle all day, but back at home when it's dinner time
Always on my grind, got a new chick with a new whip
She take an X, now only fuck with exclusive
And I came here with checks on me, no Nike, but I do it
Don't trust hoes, that's foolish
I kill tracks go ape shit, I'm ruthless
They bite me they toothless
Pockets fat can't stop me, Bruce Bruce shit
I'm tryna get them plaques, nigga no toothpicks
All I'm tryna do is get you in the mood
Change your attitude, show you I'm the better dude
What I gotta do?

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
I just wanna make you smile, baby
Take a ride, and talk for a while
And I promise it won't take too long
And I swear I won't treat you wrong, baby
I just wanna see you, baby
I just wanna see you, baby
I just wanna make you smile, baby
Take a ride, and talk for a while
And I promise it won't take too long
And I swear I won't treat you wrong, baby
I just wanna see you, baby
I just wanna see you, baby
I just wanna see you, baby
