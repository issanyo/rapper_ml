[Hook: Monty]
Said she wanna smoke
Said she wanna drink
Ain’t tryna take it slow
While I’m touching on your frame
Said she wanna smoke
Said she wanna drink
Ain’t tryna take it slow
While I’m touching on your frame

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Touching on you baby
I just left the bank and
I got Benjamin’s wit’ me
What the fuck you think?
I’m like what the fuck’s she drinkin’?
Mix it in with your coffee
You know I don’t give a fuck
Zoo Gang all the way up
And it’s Zoovie, I’m with Monty
Bitch look like Ashanti and I roll on Ashanti
Rari switching lanes
And they know I’m hella paid man
I just dig the grave
Dumpin' niggas in the grave man
ZooWap move like cave
I got Rollies, black new face man
I swoop all the molly
We gon' pop all these for days man
Off of hella Xannies
I would go thru Xans for days man
Sleepin' that shit off man
I pop 30s, now shit open
Cause it’s ZooVier and it’s Monty

[Hook: Monty]
Said she wanna smoke
Said she wanna drink
Ain’t tryna take it slow
While I’m touching on your frame
Said she wanna smoke
Said she wanna drink
Ain’t tryna take it slow
While I’m touching on your frame

[Verse 2: Monty]
What’s my name, what’s my name?
Getting to it, she don’t play no games
Bitch I’m cooling and I’m 17
When we do it I’ma make you scream
From the back, holding on my chain
Throw it back, and give me some brain
Just relax, I know why you came
It’s dripping wet and money ain’t a thang
Ain’t got to keep it on the low
We got money in the bank
And what I’m sipping slow
She rock Alexander Wang

[Hook: Monty]
Said she wanna smoke
Said she wanna drink
Ain’t tryna take it slow
While I’m touching on your frame
Said she wanna smoke
Said she wanna drink
Ain’t tryna take it slow
While I’m touching on your frame
