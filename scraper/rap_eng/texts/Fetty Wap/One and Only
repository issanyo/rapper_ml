[Verse 1: Jhonni Blaze]
I cannot wait to see you
‘Cause everyday I think about you
I just need a moment
Of your time to tell you how I feel for you
I like the way you move
I like the things you do
I like those radiant eyes when you tell me it’s alright
I know that you’ll beat me
Just ask, bitch doesn’t need you
Back down, oh yeah, girl so wet

[Hook: Jhonni Blaze]
Don’t wanna waste another moment without you
Don’t wanna end the night without you
Take me by the hand and show me
Why I’ll always be your one and only
I love you forever
They can’t take you away even if they tried
Designer styles, there’s more to life baby
You’re my everything and that’s alright

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
If I’m the air, then you’re the clouds that help me move, yea
And girl I swear, it ain’t a thing I wouldn’t move, yea
So good, seein’ you, yea baby
I just want you, yea baby
I don’t care who cares, baby
I’m stuck on you, yea baby
You say you want to be my only one, yea
I’m sayin’ could I trust if there wasn’t no funds
With the heat, is you pullin’ out guns
If it’s real would go or not run, baby
Make everything about us, baby
No lies, everything about trust, baby
Could I trust if there wasn’t no funds
Baby with the heat, is you pullin’ out guns, yea
If it’s real would go or not run, baby
Make everything about us, baby
No lies, everything about trust, baby
Roll up, we can smoke and get stuck
Baby, make love in the back of my truck
Baby, yea everything is about us, yeahh

[Hook: Jhonni Blaze]
Don’t wanna waste another moment without you
Don’t wanna end the night without you
Take me by the hand and show me
Why I’ll always be your one and only
I love you forever
They can’t take you away even if they tried
Designer styles, there’s more to life baby
You’re my everything and that’s alright
