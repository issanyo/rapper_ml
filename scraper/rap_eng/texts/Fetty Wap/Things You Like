Trips to the mall, trips to the bank
Alexander Wang, private dinner dates

Just left Miami, LA next week
All these different cities
I can tell you like things like that

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
Rollie on your wrist girl, that's time well spent
And when you rockin' that Chanel, girl I love your scent
Memories that'll last while we spendin' this cash
You said this will be forever and nowadays that's too fast
Like 300 on the dash, G wagon all black
New keys to the pad, you got all these jealous hoes mad
And they be on that hatin' shit, you get it all because girl you my favorite
I bet your life sometimes, they think 'bout takin' it
All of this shit you get, they wish they can get

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
It kinda is on, blowin' that strong
In Miami, in the grown, yeah
Tell me what you want, and I'm on it, ayy
Private jet in the morning, ayy
Just down in the streets, yeah
Do you know what I mean, yeah
Blow hundereds of the green, yeah
I smoke pounds of the weed, yeah
Would you like to be with Zoovie, baby
Fuck your ex and his history, baby
Make it last, make history, baby
Like your style like a mystery, baby
Get you wet, make it slippery, baby
When I'm gone, you'll be missin' me, baby
Cause I miss you, babe I wanna kiss you, ayy
Texts on the road when I dip through baby
Yeah baby
