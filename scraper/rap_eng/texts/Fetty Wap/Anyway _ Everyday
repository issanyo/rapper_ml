Everyday
I get on my shit bruh, I'm at that cake
I might get my dick sucked and watch the game
Thinkin' 'bout my nigga, locked in that cage
Bitch I'm at my neck in this shit, deep in the gang
Fuck around and get wet out this bitch
Watch where ya hang
Anyway yeah this like everyday yeah
Anyway yeah this like everyday yeah
Anyway yeah this like everyday yeah
Anyway yeah this like everyday yeah

[Verse 1: Trouble]
Thuggin' out strollin' just makin' my plays and
Caught a lil bitch out the Serenade
Man that little bitch is so irritating
She callin' my phone, she so irritating
She can't stay from round, she just can't
I bring em everywhere cabanas
I like the pants no MC hammer
Man these some pretty little dancers
My family just life in the streets and the beat
I might be Hot Sauce wit the handles
Told 'em it's how do you handle the shit
Your life like a eight in a Fanta
No wonder when a nigga givin' you shit
You treat a nigga like he Santa
Project playa from Atlanta
With the shit that's on my nana

[Hook]
Everyday
I get on my shit bruh, I'm at that cake

Thinkin' 'bout my nigga, locked in that cage
Bitch I'm at my neck in this shit, deep in the gang
Fuck around and get wet out this bitch
Watch where ya hang
Anyway yeah this like everyday yeah
Anyway yeah this like everyday yeah
Anyway yeah this like everyday yeah
Anyway yeah this like everyday yeah

[Verse 2:Fetty Wap]
Niggas is bitches, I notice
I might pull up in a Lotus
I get this money, you notice
I swerve on niggas on purpose
32 magazine, baby
40 cal with the beam, baby
Black 'i' and its clean, baby
I live a young nigga dream, baby
Fetty Wap, I'm with Trouble Trouble
I need the money, need it on the double
I just dropped 200 in Vegas, ayy
These bitches, they know how I'm playin', ayy
These niggas, they know I ain't playin', ayy
My niggas'll roll where you stay at, ayy
My boys from the zoo, we don't play that, ayy
We pull out those guns and spray that, down
We want that cash, we need it now, ayy
Bitch I'm Zoovier Zoo, I hold it down, ayy
If you want that war, we want it now
Niggas kickin' in your door, don't make a sound, wow
