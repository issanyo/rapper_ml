[Intro: Tapia]
Light it up, oh light it up
Light it up, light it up, oh yeah

[Hook: Tapia]
See I don't want to fuss and fight, fuss and fight
I'm on the move, I'm on the grind, on the grind
The money always on my time, on my time
I told you baby we gon' be fine
I told you baby we gon' be fine

[Verse 1: Tapia]
Don't fuss and fight
Baby just play nice, I'ma do you right
Take a date on a hill, a little candle light
Then its back downstairs, I'm bang it twice
I don't know what the hell went wrong
But I must admit I was wrong
Baby I was tripping, baby girl I was gone
Them bitches be nothing, back when bitches were flawless

[Bridge: Tapia]
See I don't want, see I don't want
No fuss or fights, no more argues
I just adore you, just tryna spoil you
Go out of my way, my way, my way
Just to call you

[Hook]
See I don't want to fuss and fight, fuss and fight
I'm on the move, I'm on the grind, on the grind
The money always on my time, on my time
I told you baby we gon' be fine
I told you baby

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
I know what they want, stay on my grind
That's why you mad, don't play my song
You know I like you, you know I need you
Cuz' girl I want you, just let me please you
See all my green
So I say wanna move
Shawty whatcha' wanna do
It's just Fetty Wap and you
Let me please you
Flash through you
So I can show em' who
All we want is you
Yeah Baby

[Hook: Tapia]
See I don't want to fuss and fight, fuss and fight
I'm on the move, I'm on the grind, on the grind
The money always on my time, on my time
I told you baby we gon' be fine
I told you baby
