[Intro: House Party]
Party, damn!
Party

[Hook: House Party]
My squad, my squad, my squad
Go hard, go hard, go hard
Big guap in foreign cars
They know just who we are

[Verse 1: House Party]
I ain't never ask your advice in the first place (in the first place)
Fuck a 9 to 5, the whole world is my workplace
(Fuck a 9 to 5 nigga, damn)
Keep the thing on me but it's only for the worst case
(Only for the worst case)
Slow down with them drugs, they gon' kill you
Where my hearse, yeh? (That mud)
Stop drinkin' that shit, it's no good for you baby (no good)
I just bought a coupe and I'm tryna get fly with my baby
I ain't never have bitches this bad in my life
This somethin' a nigga used to (no)
Kim K type bitches gettin' hit the same night
Man, that's just what the crew do (squad)
I been double cupped all day (all day)
I been rollin' up all day (all day)
Two bitches wasn't good enough (no)
I think I'm 'bout to have a 4-way (4-way)
Can't wait for the summer time (summer)
We been grindin' hard all winter (all winter)
Got me feeling like old Lebron (6 doe)
We gon' be the champs once the Heat hit us (ooh)

[Hook: House Party]
My squad, my squad, my squad
Go hard, go hard, go hard
Big guap in foreign cars

My squad, my squad, my squad
Go hard, go hard, go hard
Big guap in foreign cars
They know just who we are
