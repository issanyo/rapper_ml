[Intro]
Harlem, Harlem, Harlem
Shawty know she bad, she bad, bad
Shawty know she bad, she bad, bad

[Hook]
Shawty know she bad, give her anything she want
When I pull up with racks, take her anywhere she want
And don't reach at your ex, I got everything he don't
And girl I love that ass and the way you walk
Shawty know she bad, she bad, bad
Shawty know she bad, she bad, bad
Shawty know she bad, give her anything she want
And girl I love that ass and the way you walk

[Verse 1]
Milk chocolate, she good
Eat her up like I should
Roll her ass in my wood
She love a nigga from the hood
I'ma lift you up, I'ma dick you down
You gone make that sound
I can tell you bout that mouth
By the way you frown
Then I put shit down
Tryna have my child but not right now
Let's get this mula
Got a problem with your ex
Call Fetty four fifths, two hits, medula
Like a nail in the wall, hang it bang bang
Baby I wanna screw ya
Like you check the shit
Lay down ya girl, just wanna do ya
Tell ya nigga calm down
Hooligans with a bunch of shooters

[Bridge]
And I know she bad
And I know she bad
And I know she bad
And I know she bad
And I know she bad
And I know she bad

[Hook]
Shawty know she bad, give her anything she want
When I pull up with racks, take her anywhere she want
And don't reach at your ex, I got everything he don't
And girl I love that ass and the way you walk
Shawty know she bad, she bad, bad
Shawty know she bad, she bad, bad
Shawty know she bad, give her anything she want
And girl I love that ass and the way you walk

[Verse 2]
My nigga run up in a bitch like that
Bitch so pretty with an ass so fat
Day time sex, night time in the trap
Throwin' up a check, I'ma flip it two stack
Gettin' money, countin' up racks
All black dress and the heels to match
Ya'll like it like that, ya'll like it like that
Look, True Religion, I'm freshman true
When on her we be flexin'
Young Fetty cash up next man
All black stones in my necklace
Diamond stones in her bracelet
Two woods cause we facing it
Started way on the third floor, ended up in the basement

[Bridge 2]
Shawty know she bad
Upper ranking class class
I just pulled out that Beemer
She just pulled out that Jag
We got them haters mad
They callin' it sad
But I don't give a fuck because I'm never lookin' back

[Hook]
Shawty know she bad, give her anything she want
When I pull up with racks, take her anywhere she want
And don't reach at your ex, I got everything he don't
And girl I love that ass and the way you walk
Shawty know she bad, she bad, bad
Shawty know she bad, she bad, bad
Shawty know she bad, give her anything she want
And girl I love that ass and the way you walk
