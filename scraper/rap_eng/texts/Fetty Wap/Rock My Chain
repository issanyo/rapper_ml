[Intro: Fetty Wap]
Zoo Zoo! 1738! M-80! RGF!

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Ayy just met her at the club, tryna rock my chain
She wanna ride in my car, don't know my name
She wanna rep my set, don't know my gang
Girl don't flip that check, ain't nothin' change
Cause we the squad of the year, baby
You see the squad over here, baby
Girl we the squad of the year, baby
See the squad over here, baby

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Zoovier's known for sayin', "Yeaaaaaah baby!"
And now my vision crystal clear, baby
I see you from a mile away, baby
ZooWap, I am here to stay, baby
Riding in my own lane, baby
Fuck what these niggas say, baby
I got bands, know I came to play, baby
One eye rearranged, baby
Flyin' in my Robin jeans
Baby know my robin wings
Zoovier's known for sayin', "Yeaaaaaah baby!"
I swear I got my niggas, yeah baby

Remy Boyz go fuckin' hard, baby
RGF they blowin' up, baby
And we ain't takin' no loss, baby
Gotta win, gotta win, gotta go
Get them bands, get them bands, get that dough
Gotta win, gotta win, gotta win
Til they breakin' us in, we break in

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Ayy just met her at the club, tryna rock my chain
She wanna ride in my car, don't know my name
She wanna rep my set, don't know my gang
Girl don't flip that check, ain't nothin' change
Cause we the squad of the year, baby
You see the squad over here, baby
Girl we the squad of the year, baby
See the squad over here, baby

[Verse 2: M-80]
I hopped in the shower
Then hopped in some pussy, then hopped in the shower
Then hopped in the 'Rari
And met up with Fetty and rolled up Rhode Island
All of my niggas tote 30s and 40s
These niggas be wildin'
Hit 'em like Spalding
Then switch in my car cause nigga we ballin'
We the squad of the year, baby
Pull up and hit your bitch from the rear, baby
All these carats and rocks in my ear, baby
Make it hard for a nigga to hear, baby
Say you wanna rock a nigga's chain, baby
But first you gotta give a nigga brain, baby
But hold up, you don't even know my name, baby
But we can change all that, it's M-80, baby
Mothafuckin' RGF
Mothafuckin' Remy Boyz
Mothafuckin' fuck Brick Squad
It's our time, we're takin' off, squaaa!
