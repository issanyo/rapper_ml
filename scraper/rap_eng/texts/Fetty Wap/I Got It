[Intro: Sophie Beem]
You want it
I got it
You want it
Baby, I got it
You want it
I got it
You want it
Baby, I got it

[Verse 1: Sophie Beem]
Babe, you better understand
The things I do they're all for you
It's only part of the plan
Come a little closer now
I'll let you in, I'll show you how
Feels like a dangerous game

[Pre-Chorus: Sophie Beem]
I say "hey yo, let's go
I know a place we'll lay low
Ain't nobody gotta notice"
I say "hey yo, let's go
I know a place we'll lay low
Ain't nobody gotta notice"

[Chorus: Sophie Beem]
Cause it's so high when you need me some more
And I'll let you want me some more
It's so fine when you need me some more
There is something going on with you and me

[Post-Chorus: Sophie Beem]
You want it
I got it
You want it
Baby, I got it
(Yes, I do)
You want it
I got it
You want it
Baby, I got it

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
I swear that you need it, so wrong that you need it
I want you to feel me how I'm feelin' you
When I see you, you let me loose
Do it all for you, spend it all on you
Cause you're my baby, drive me crazy
Get caught up lately in that new Mercedes
Drop coupe, I know you like that, baby
Highway cruise, about a buck 80
Get bands, I spend 'em on my baby
Drop coupe, I know you like that, baby
Highway cruise, about a buck 80

[Chorus: Sophie Beem]
Cause it's so high when you need me some more
And I'll let you want me some more
It's so fine when you need me some more
There is something going on with you and me

[Post-Chorus: Sophie Beem]
You want it
I got it
You want it
Baby, I got it
You want it
I got it
You want it
Baby, I got it
You want it
I got it
You want it
Baby, I got it
You want it
I got it
You want it
Baby, I got it

[Outro: Sophie Beem]
You want it
I got it
You want it
Baby, I got it
