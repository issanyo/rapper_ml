[Bridge: Fetty Wap]
Ay, and you go where I lead you, know what I mean baby
Ay, and you more than a friend, like a drug I'm a fiend baby
Ay, when I raise my eyes at you when I sleep baby
It's you and me baby, ay, ay

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
You know I love your sexy face, my queen baby
You think I don't love you, fuck you mean baby?
And let's go back and think of things baby
How this life was once a dream baby
Ay, from the old whip to a Mercedes, yeah
And from the old spot where we stay at now
Access to everything baby why you playing games?
Ain't nothing stay the same, is you staying or not? Wap

[Hook: Samantha]
Baby I ain't going nowhere
Can't nobody love me better
Can't nobody love me better, love me better, love me better
I ain't going nowhere
Can't nobody love me better
Can't nobody love me better, love me better, love me better
Yeah

[Verse 2: Samantha]
By my side is where I keep him
Despite what niggas say, I would never leave him
Butterflies when I see him
Whether we off and on, I'm still sliding in them DMs
I'm not the slide or the BM, 745 be the BM
Cruising in my ride with the tints, you can't see 'em
Love me long time from the AM to the PM

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
Ay, let me nigga who do it better
Ay, young nigga done got his bread up
Ay, stop playing I'm getting fed up
Ay, stay pretty and keep it redder
Ay, and I be tripping over you baby
Ay, and to keep it real I ain't over you baby
Ay, and no nigga coming over too baby
Ay, water diamonds, you know how I do baby

[Hook: Samantha]
Baby I ain't going nowhere
Can't nobody love me better
Can't nobody love me better, love me better, love me better
I ain't going nowhere
Can't nobody love me better
Can't nobody love me better, love me better, love me better
Yeah

[Bridge: Fetty Wap]
Ay, and you go where I lead you, know what I mean baby
Ay, and you more than a friend, like a drug I'm a fiend baby
Ay, when I raise my eyes at you when I sleep baby
It's you and me baby, ay, ay

[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
