I got used to livin like a star, like a star (like a star)
I got heated floors in my house, Persian carpets (god damn)

And my only dream was trappin', I did not believe in rappin' (god
damn)
Trap Queen checks hittin' hard, hittin' hard
Young paid nigga, I am not gon' play with ya (god damn)
On June 7th, momma made a star, made a star (made a star)
1991, now look what I’ve become now

{Outro}
I got used to livin' like a star
I got heated floors in my house, Persian carpets
Gold toilet, just like Escobar
Only dream was trappin', I don’t believe in rappin'
Trap Queen checks hittin' hard
Young paid nigga, I am not gon' play with ya
On June 7th, momma made a star (June 7th momma made a star)
1991, now look what I’ve become now
