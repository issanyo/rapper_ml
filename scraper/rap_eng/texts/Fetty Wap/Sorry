[HOOK]
She a bad bitch and she thick
We gassed up so you knowin that its litt
Spent a couple bands on a outfit
And you mad cuz I'm fuckin yo bitch
I'm sorry
I bought another whip
I'm sorry
I fucked another bitch

I copped another chain
I'm sorry
Oops I made it rain I'm sorry

[VERSE]
All she wanna do is smoke & party
Yo man oh yeah he broke he wear ed hardy
See I just sip the Hen she like Bacardi
They took 5 shots now they naughty

She say can we get a pic witchu
Is it cuz the diamonds on me look like Pikachu
Lemme show you all these racks like peek-a-boo
Lemme show you what these 100's & these 50's do

Thats why my, diamonds shining hard Oh my, Oh my God
See I be drippin sauce when I'm in the mall
They all up on the boy, all up on the boy
Im sorry, oops I'm sorry
