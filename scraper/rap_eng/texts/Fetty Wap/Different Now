[Intro]
Turn the music up a little bit
(Yeah babe)
Haha, Fetty Wap on the air

[Hook]
Oh my God it's so different now, yeah
How they used to hear me now they let me down, yeah
I remember days of wearing hammy downs, yeah
Got it out the mud, they understand me now
I swear I'm just a young nigga who keep countin' up a check
I be havin' fun with ya, I take nothing to the head
I don't have a money issue, I'm in love with savin' bank
Gotta tell you what I rep, I got it tatted on my head, yeah
Oh my God it's so different now, yeah
How they used to hear me now they let me down, yeah
I remember days of wearing hammy downs
Got it out the mud, they understand me now
I swear I'm just a young nigga who keep countin' up a check
I be havin' fun with ya, I take nothin' to the head
I don't have a money issue, I'm in love with savin' bank
Gotta tell you what I rep, I got it tatted on my head

[Verse]
Let me tell you about how the shit change
Got a couple six chains
Guccis on my six range
Rollie cost me 85
So you know my shit blang
Bought my first 'Rari at 22
That shit clean
Made my first million at 22
It's rich dreams
Made my mama quit her fuckin' job
I'm doin' big things
And she know I'm still a street nigga
Tryna get clean
Couple niggas screamin' 12 hundred
And they get cream
Free my nigga Slick P
I'm juggin' till they get me
You can hit up 4k if you need some good weed
Cause niggas really got it out the trap, ayy
And Nitt Da Gritt was known for selling crack, ayy
I'm from 12th and 22nd, that's a fact
Hey niggas tried to bring us down, I brought us back
Hey 22nd I put Harlem on the map
Hey niggas tryna bring us down, I brought us back
Hey 22nd I put Harlem on the map
Woah, yeah

[Hook]
Oh my God it's so different now, yeah
How they used to hear me now they let me down, yeah
I remember days of wearing hammy downs, yeah
Got it out the mud, they understand me now
I swear I'm just a young nigga who keep countin' up a check
I be havin' fun with ya, I take nothing to the head
I don't have a money issue, I'm in love with savin' bank
Gotta tell you what I rep, I got it tatted on my head, yeah
Oh my God it's so different now, yeah
How they used to hear me now they let me down, yeah
I remember days of wearing hammy downs
Got it out the mud, they understand me now
I swear I'm just a young nigga who keep countin' up a check
I be havin' fun with ya, I take nothing to the head
I don't have a money issue, I'm in love with savin' bank
Gotta tell you what I rep, I got it tatted on my head
Yeah
