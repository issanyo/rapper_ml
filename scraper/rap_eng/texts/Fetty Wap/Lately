[Intro: House Party]
Party, Wap, haha
RGF the island

[Hook: House Party]
Lately I been on the road
Workin' hard, I been gone
I know you're lonely at home
No time to hit your phone
But you know girl, soon as I touch
I'ma take it slow, I won't rush
Dirty thoughts in my cup
Don't think that I'm not missin' you
Don't think that I don't visit you in the depths of my mind
Don't think that I'm not here
Don't think that I don't care
Don't think that I'm just out here to let hoes get my time

[Verse 1: House Party]
Girl you know you got it sewed, sewed up
When the money made I'm comin' home, straight up
Just said "Hi" on your phone, damn
You my queen and nobody can change that but you, you
Where your piece, what's come through? come through
Don't want nobody else but you, damn
I'ma lick you twice for every second that we miss, damn
I got things to do and girl you first up on my list, damn
I don't have much time but I'ma spend it all with you, damn
Don't make me look stupid cause I hate to play the fool

[Bridge: House Party]
Cause when I find some time, when I find the time
When I find some time, when I find the time
I'ma spend it all on you, damn
I'ma spend it all on you, yeah yeah, yeah yeaaah

[Hook: House Party]
Lately I been on the road
Workin' hard, I been gone
I know you're lonely at home
No time to hit your phone
But you know girl, soon as I touch
I'ma take it slow, I won't rush
Dirty thoughts in my cup
Don't think that I'm not missin' you
Don't think that I don't visit you in the depths of my mind
Don't think that I'm not here
Don't think that I don't care
Don't think that I'm just out here to let hoes get my time

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Zoovier, damn, ayy
Don't think that I don't want you
I think that I'm just different
I'm just gettin' this cash
Give you a tour, I'm tryna tour you
Explore your body, show me the secret island
I ain't actin', I'ma eat it up til it's gone
Have you leakin', drippin', walk in my zone, ayy
First you gon' pay me them bands, ayy
Now we just stackin' them bands, ayy
I'm gon' spend this cash with you, baby
I'm gon' make it splash on you, baby
But Zoovie car ain't have no roof, baby
And you know what that Zoovie do, baby
Swear to God that its just you and me, baby
Let me show you why I make the Zoo, baby
