[Intro]
Aye, 1738! Zoovier!

[Hook]
Aye, my grandma said her grandson crazy
She said, "Please pull your pants up, baby"
Aye, I told her, "Bands make my pants sag crazy"
Aye, she said, "I don't know what bands is, baby"
That's just money, grandma, that's just money
That's just money, grandma, that's just money
Aye, I told her, "Bands make my pants sag crazy"
Aye, she said, "I don't know what bands is, baby"

[Verse]
Aye, all this money that I'm countin', yeah I'm carryin'
18,000K I spend a day, I could embarrass her
Aye his bitch for years just made it clear she wouldn't marry him
Aye I fucked her once then disappeared, that shit hilarious
Aye, I'm the Zoo, bitch, you are you, I don't do marriages
Aye, look, both of my kin's rich, I don't push carriages
Aye, and I just say the word, they send them packages
Aye, I send up the cash and then I'm wrappin' them
Aye, look, I live in the Zoo and I stay strapped with them
Aye, you hang with the goons and you get whacked with them
Aye, bitch, I live in the Zoo, stay and I'm paid with them
Aye, bitch, you stay with the goons and you get wrapped with them

[Hook]
Aye, grandma said her grandson crazy
She said, "Please pull your pants up, baby"
Aye, I told her, "Bands make my pants sag crazy"
Aye, she said, "I don't know what bands is, baby"
That's just money, grandma, that's just money
That's just money, grandma, that's just money
Aye, told her, "Bands make my pants sag crazy"
Aye, she said, "I don't know what bands is, baby"
Aye
