[Hook]
Beatin' down your block, Fetty Wap, boomin!
Meet him for my guap, had to bring the tool in
RGF the squad and we not recruitin'
Mike G, hundred zoo, only known for shootin'
Beatin' down your block, Fetty Wap, boomin!
Meet him for my guap, had to bring the tool in
RGF the squad and we not recruitin'
Mike G, hundred zoo, only known for shootin'

[Verse 1]
Zoo Gang, we is scorin' like we hoopin'
Fuckin' with my money, is you stupid?
Trickin' just like I wasn't usin' loosies
Why? Remember them days, was servin' out my hooptie
Started from the bottom, hallelujah
Don't come short with my shit, my bro will shoot yah
I collect income 6 different ways
Fetty Wap up, they say that nigga paid
Look I just stack the cheddar, man the same
Won't let the shit control me, I don't want the fame
I just want the cash but my hood love me
Finesse, gone for 20 seconds, shit can get ugly

[Hook]
Beatin' down your block, Fetty Wap, boomin!
Meet him for my guap, had to bring the tool in
RGF the squad and we not recruitin'
Mike G, hundred zoo, only known for shootin'
Beatin' down your block, Fetty Wap, boomin!
Meet him for my guap, had to bring the tool in
RGF the squad and we not recruitin'
Mike G, hundred zoo, only known for shootin'

[Verse 2]
For my niggas, know I'm mothafuckin' Wap
Big bands, see the wheels on the body
Rap full time, juugin' is my hobby
If you ain't my nigga, keep your ass from 'round me
Smell the dope scent, Zoo, we smoke cut
Back to back, jet black painted Audis
OGs from the Zoo hang 'round me
See the stones on my chain? They ain't cloudy
New Jersey niggas'll turn up at your party
That bitch you was with chugs Remy just like a hobby
New Jersey niggas'll turn up at your party
That bitch you was with chugs Remy just like a hobby

[Outro]
Boomin
Free my nigga Guwop, you know how we doo it
ZooWap and I'm comin' through and
I might just pull me out a Bentley coupe and
101738
Free my nigga Guwop
Brick Squad, Zoo Gang
RGF, SQUAD!
