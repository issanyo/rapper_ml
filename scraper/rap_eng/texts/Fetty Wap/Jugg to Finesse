Fetty:              (Hook v.)

Ay

I swear we go to war for a check
Cuz' first you gotta' jugg to finnesse

For my niggas in my hood I'ma flex
Ay yeah baby

Sky: Know that I'ma die for my respect
If not then I'll be wollowin' and upset

Heard that I be leanin' like I'm famous
And all them other haters they be lame and...

Cookin mo', checking, whipin' at the floor
Never heard of makin noise
Never came through with the toys

Token on the balfis, send em' to my office
They are wit' it they against me
Tell em' to get it off

Put that on the cross, I'm on my versi, poppin'
Birds in them 'alls
Like my name is Marceline

And thirsty for the spot-light, baby you can see me
There's my delivery and service some way...

Through the small and the pain, but we made it through the rain
