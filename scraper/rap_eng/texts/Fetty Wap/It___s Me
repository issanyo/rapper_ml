Hook:
Aye, yeah baby
Aye, aye
Shorty bad and she know that shit
She gave me a chance and it was over with
And they know exactly who she rollin’ with
Aye, left her other nigga; she was over him
Aye, and it’s me baby, it’s me baby
And I’m lookin’ in your eyes like “you are for me baby”
You got the papers on my rari and my keys baby
Said “if I got titles it don’t mean nothin’ to me baby”
Said “it’s me baby, it’s me baby”
Aye, I’m lookin’ in your eyes “like you are for me baby”
You got the papers on my rarri and the keys baby
Said “if I got titles it don’t mean nothin’ to me baby”

Verse:
Aye, I ain’t playing with you baby
In the drop going crazy, zoogang world famous
All my diamonds glissinin’, 6 feet if he mention me
Actin’ real with my pistol, shorty said she missin’ me
Fetty Wap official, aye come and take a trip with me
2 pills of ecstasy, had the pussy addressing me
I be on my smooth shit, still could get your crew whipped
I done lost to school quick, Zoovie on that goon shit
1738, whip the stoves and dirty places, still I have been tryna shape aye
Lately I’ve been living great, aye, 1738, whip the stoves and dirty places, still I have been tryna shape aye
Lately I’ve been living greate, aye, 1738
