[Verse 1]
Ay, started on 22nd, I'm from Harlem
Number one like I'm D. Rose, I be scorin'
All net with the free throw, Chris Paulin'
Old school sittin' on Champs: Mike Jordan
Remy Boyz, big Guwop goin' all out
Bad bitch, I'm fuckin' her good, I gave her all dick
All these niggas so pussy 'cause they all wet
My boys pullin' out guap 'cause we all rich
My boys pull out big knots 'cause we all flip
My boys givin' out shots 'cause they all sick
Remy Boyz, we popped up, they like, "Ah, shit"
