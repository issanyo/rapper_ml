[Chorus: Quavo]
I pour an eight in a liter (ayy)
We trendin' the web like PETA (we trendin')
I'm an OG like Adidas (OG!)
Two seater, two seater, two seater (skrrt)
I got an iPhone and beeper (brrt)
Look at your ho, she a cheater (look at her)
And you still want to keep her (ew)
I just Michael Jackson, beat her (beat it)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Don't talk about swag, I'm dabbin' (I'm dabbin')
I read up on all new assassins (pow)
I'm movin' in orderly fashion
We gotta move like Obama, Obama, Obama
My niggas playing with plastic (plastic)
My life a real scare tactic (scary)
You niggas drinkin' molasses
What is you drinkin'?
Why did you buy that and drink it?
When I first got my pound, I broke it down (ayy)
Dancin' with the work like I'm James Brown (ow)
Young nigga havin' fame 'round town
Then we got rich off of verbs and nouns
Never been a sucker, never been a clown
Cash out a four four check, then watch it bounce
Trap out the bando, trap out the ounce
Finesse the plug 'cause he keeps changin' amounts (go)
Thirty in my hand, pump on the couch
'Cause a nigga paranoid now (paranoid)
If you come up, don't abandon your hood (naw)
They'll be the first to punch you right out
My life is lookin' amazin' (ooh)
If I send you rice, it come with the gravy
Think a nigga talkin' crazy (huh?)
Try it 'fore you buy it, I make you pay me (go!)

[Chorus: Quavo]
I pour an eight in a liter (ayy)
We trendin' the web like PETA (we trendin')
I'm an OG like Adidas (OG!)
Two seater, two seater, two seater (skrrt)
I got an iPhone and beeper (brrt)
Look at your ho, she a cheater (look at her)
And you still want to keep her (ew)
I just Michael Jackson, beat her (beat it)

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
I hurt suckers' feelings, I don't need you
Zoovie Zoo love Rem' by the liter
It’s gettin' cold and I love juugin' season
Twenty thou' get you murked for no reason
Aye, Zoo Gang corner bending
This two seater sound different
I drop the top, no ceilings
I'm skirtin' on 'em when I serve 'em
Collect mine, hit the birds, then
'Fore I ran for the workin'
I trap hard, that’s my worry
I put that on my Irving
Eight-hundred-thousand on my brand new Benz
Ask Zoo Gang, we don't leave loose ends
Eighty Zoo City at the corner, and I [?]
And Quavo and ZooWap make your bitch jump in

[Chorus: Quavo]
I pour an eight in a liter (ayy)
We trendin' the web like PETA (we trendin')
I'm an OG like Adidas (OG!)
Two seater, two seater, two seater (skrrt)
I got an iPhone and beeper (brrt)
Look at your ho, she a cheater (look at her)
And you still want to keep her (ew)
I just Michael Jackson, beat her (beat it)
