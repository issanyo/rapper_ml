[Intro]
Wah, wah, ayy
1738, yeah baby
Oh-oh, oh

[Hook]
I'm flossin', pourin' up drank baby
Spent 50k on my jeans baby
I don't give a fuck what they think baby
Let's have a date at the bank baby

[Verse]
Ayy, fine wine, it go for us baby
Ayy, if you ready then go for it baby
Ayy, you light up like a blow torch baby
Ayy, and anyone flossin' baby
Ayy, I'm in love like the Carsons baby
Ayy, Zoo Gang, I'm the boss now baby
Ayy, Gritty, Mimi, and Stoner now baby
Ayy, now they know who we are now baby
I'm bent up, I just broke the bank
Roll Backwoods, all I smoke is dank
And I'm ballin', he fallin'
I don't know why his bitch keep callin'
It's the Zoo Gang honcho and Zoovier baby
1738, you know who near baby
Left a lot of pussy niggas in the rear view baby
I'll never let these pussy niggas near you baby
In my past life, I hope it don't scare you baby
I'm bossed up, get his ass charged up
Talkin' like Wu-Tang screamin' out Zoo Gang
Fuck who you came with
I went from lil block to bein' famous
My mom was first to feel changes
I bough so much kinds I swear I flow stranger
Catch me on the highway, Beemers, no Rangers
Big Zoowap ball hard cause they facin'
I drink white and dark, I'm not racist
Drop bout 75 on one bracelet
I don't want your bitch cause she basic
I drink red, Chicago, not the Lakers
In my kitchen I love to bake it
Bakin' soda hit the pot and start scrapin'
Poppa Smurf, big blue bands, boy I'm cakin'
Poppa Smurf, big blue bands, boy I'm cakin'

[Outro]
Wap, ayy
I'm Mike Jones, Jones
And I stay flossin' in that candy paint
Rollin' dank
Sippin' drank on 84 swangers
Rollin' Chevy, rollin' baby
Yeah, baby
Yeah, baby
You're done, you're done
And I'm flossin' sippin' that purple drank
On purple sippin' that purple drank
Screens fallin rims crawlin
I don't know why the girls keep callin'
Yeah, baby
Oh, oh, oh
1738, Zoovie
Hey, God damn
We only just begun man
Zoothousand-sixteen
RGF productions, Zoogang RGF man
You're done
