[Intro: Fetty Wap]
Neuman's, I swear that's where I saw you
Monty, Zoovier, Squad
Zoovier, Montana, 1738, ZooGang

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
I seen you up in Neuman's, I swear that's where I saw you
Put your number in my cell girl, I swear I'm gonna call you
I can shut the mall down, is that what you want boo?
Tell me that you need me, cause girl I swear I'm off you

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Baby blue and bandz and Neuman's, ridin' in my Rari
Pull up in the Phantom, hop out in my Raris
Bandz all in my Robin's, boy you see my flyin'
Gold wings on my pocket, 500 just to buy 'em
Bitch they call me Zoovie, my life is like a movie
Greedy got me so rich, buy all my niggas Jordan's
All my niggas flossin', all we ride in foreigns
All my niggas flossin', bitch we ball like Jordan

[Verse 2: Monty]
I'ma flex, baby I'ma flex
Diamonds on my neck, fuck ya ex
He ain't doin' shit, Remy Boyz up next
Cut the check, throwin' up the west, these niggas upset
For the team, million dollar dreams, baby nothin' less
Smokin' dope, you can smell the scent, that's my favorite smell
And she thick, curvy 'round the hips, like she K. Michelle
And I mean it, we can keep it secret, ain't no kiss and tell
In the trap, she gon' bring it back, know her very well
And I need you
They know how we do
Thots with me when I breeze through
Shopping sprees when I see you
Cause I ain't worried 'bout any of 'em
Tryna make you my Remy rose
I see you in Neuman
Your man you should leave him
He don't do it like we can

[Hook]
