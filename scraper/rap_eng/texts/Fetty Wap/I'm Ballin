I was the one that they doubted

Now she wanna come around me
Got a feelin my weight left her drownin'
You know, young nigga 'bout his dough
I ain't tryna chase these hoes
I got now, I'm goin' in too fuego I am him
Pull up on 'em in the foreign, watch 'em all get sick
Henny shots got me lit, so I'm riding wit' da stick
Just incase I gotta blow one, empty out the clip
