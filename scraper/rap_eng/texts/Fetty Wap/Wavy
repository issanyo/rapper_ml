[Chorus]
All I want is you now, baby
Show you that it’s true now
Come with me and bust a move now, baby
Fuck with me, I fuck with you now, baby
All I want is you now, baby
All I want is now, baby
Show you that its true, baby
Come with me and bust a move now, baby
Fuck with me I fuck with you, baby
All I want is you now

[Verse]
I’ma fuck with you ‘cause you wavy
I’ma fuck with you ‘cause you crazy
I’ma fuck with you, you my baby
If I fuck with you please don’t play me
I see you walkin’ drippin’ juice, lil baby
We get nasty in the booth, lil baby
See the keys that a Coupe, lil baby
The ticket matching jewels, lil baby

[Chorus]
All I want is you
Show you that it’s true
Its nothing I won't do
To only get to you, lil baby
All I want is now, baby
Show you that its true, baby
Come with me and bust a move now, baby
Fuck with me I fuck with you now, baby
All I want is you now, baby
Show you that its true, baby
Come with me and bust a move now, baby
Fuck with me I fuck with you, baby
All I want is you
Show you that it’s true
