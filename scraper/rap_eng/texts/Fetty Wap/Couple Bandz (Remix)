[Hook]
Couple bands on my left and my right bitch
I had to find a way to get it
If a pussy nigga ever wanna fight, shit
Me and my niggas gonna hit it yea

[Verse 1]
Couple bandz I’m gone get it
Why these niggas fucking tripping
Leave em missing, I’m not tripping
If a nigga wants some action
Get the clapping
Hit em up in traffic
Leave him hanging backward
Now I’m backwards like a back wood
Couple bands to my left
Couple bands to my right
Couple bitches in the crib
All the hoe gone spend the night
Y these niggas talking shit
But they don’t ever wanna fight
Why these bitches on my dick
Always tryna get some light

You got old money, no hoes no strips
I got blue money and yo hoes, don’t trip. (Cause I got)
