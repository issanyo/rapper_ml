[Intro: Fetty Wap]
Yeah, aye, yeah
Aye, yeah, aye

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
I've been really thinkin' 'bout you, baby
The way you do your thing
I got a feelin' I won't doubt you, babe
Get a wedding ring, I keep you close stay around you, babe
For you I'ma fiend, I swear I see you in the dreams
See me in between
I've been really thinkin' 'bout you, baby
The way you do your thing
I got a feelin' I won't doubt you babe
Get a wedding ring, I keep you close stay around you, babe
For you I'ma fiend, I swear I see you in the dreams
I swear I see me in between

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
I break it down let's make it ring now, I make her scream
Off a perc, I'ma machine now, go straight to sleep
And I'll always stay around you, hope you stay around too
I'm the one that you call babe, to get whatever you need
And I love how we vibe so I spend whatever on trees
Said you love havin' sex when you be smoking on weed
And I love how you flex when you high now, baby
Make it feel like a jet when you glide down, baby
I'ma always protect ya, you mine now, baby
Baby, you get whatever, you mine now, baby
Rockin' with you forever, you mine now, baby
I'll be the one that you wake up to
And the one that you love, yeah

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
I've been really thinkin' 'bout you, baby
The way do your thing
I got a feelin' I won't doubt you, babe
Get a wedding ring, I keep you close stay around you, babe
For you I'ma fiend, I swear I see you in the dreams
See me in between
I've been really thinkin' 'bout you, baby
The way you do your thing
I got a feelin' I won't doubt you babe
Get a wedding ring, I keep you close stay around you, babe
For you I'ma fiend, I swear I see you in the dreams
I swear I see me in between

[Verse 2: M80]
Thinkin' 'bout, thinkin' 'bout you babe
Every lil' thing that you say
Every lil' thing that you do, girl I just wanna spend time with you
Don't want no war, that's not on my mind
I'm telling you I just wanna provide, get high, and hit from the side
Don't wanna play anymore girl I just wanna be yours
The only one I adore, I'll buy you, Louis galore
So every time you think about me baby
Just know I'm thinking about you too, you know you drive me crazy

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
I've been really thinkin 'bout you, baby
The way you do your thing
I got a feelin' I won't doubt you, babe
Get a wedding ring, I keep you close stay around you, babe
For you I'ma fiend, I swear I see you in the dreams
See me in between
I've been really thinkin 'bout you, baby
The way you do your thing
I got a feelin' I won't doubt you babe
Get a wedding ring, I keep you close stay around you, babe
For you I'ma fiend, I swear I see you in the dreams
I swear I see me in between
