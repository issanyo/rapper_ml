[Intro: Ralo]
Ralo LaFlare
It's hard for a bitch to sleep when she sleep with a thug

[Chorus: Sean Garrett]
Shawty on that dangerous love
She only fuck with gangsters and thugs
You think it's you but her eyes on those jewels
You think it's cool 'til them niggas come through
She only like that dangerous love
She only fuck with gangsters and thugs
She lookin' for that goon that gon' pull up to that room tonight
That gon' put it in her poom poom poom tonight

[Verse 1: Ralo]
Don't ever give that pussy to a lame
Fuck them niggas and them bitches we gon' hang
Now never tell me they could fuck you better
I know they hating, they hate to see us together
We got us some shit that they ain't got, that's what they hatin' 'bout
Even if they make the rain drop we still gon' hang out
I know that I did you wrong, I promise to treat you better
I don't fuck with freak hoes, we gon' be some freaks together
I know it's hard for you to sleep when we don't sleep together
I give no fucks about what I lose as long as we together
If we together you know I'm down if you need whatever
Ayy fuck them haters, don't ever listen what people tell ya

[Chorus: Sean Garrett]
Shawty on that dangerous love
She only fuck with gangsters and thugs
You think it's you but her eyes on those jewels
You think it's cool 'til them niggas come through
She only like that dangerous love
She only fuck with gangsters and thugs
She lookin' for that goon that gon' pull up to that room tonight
That gon' put it in her poom poom poom tonight

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'ma pull up to the room like a goon
Fuck her 'til she can't move, make her text and say you did that
Since she was talkin' big shit 'til I pulled up with the stick
Told her she was 'bout to get it and I meant that
No need to lie to you, shawty got that come back
I'm talkin' fly to you, pull up in a what's that?
I'm rockin' Off-White but my coupe all black
She want it all night and I ain't tryna fall back
She got a man but fuck that nigga, he ain't gang gang
I make a side ho out a nigga's main thang
I'm in the slideshow, feelin' like I'm Bruce Wayne
I'm in a drop Mulsanne jammin' Rick James

[Chorus: Sean Garrett]
Shawty on that dangerous love
She only fuck with gangsters and thugs
You think it's you but her eyes on those jewels
You think it's cool 'til them niggas come through
She only like that dangerous love
She only fuck with gangsters and thugs
She lookin' for that goon that gon' pull up to that room tonight
That gon' put it in her poom poom poom tonight

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
She wanna smoke and chill, pop a perc, and go crazy with the set
Niggas broke as hell, pockets hurt, and look crazy when they flex
I got too many cameras on, I went crazy on my neck
We got too many cars nigga, it look crazy on the strip
I might pull up on a bike with her and go crazy with your bitch
Bitch be pretty when the light her, ooh I think I might get her
I'ma let the mic hit her, shawty can wear my chain
Fifteen hundred on some nice dinners, I can fit a lot in her
Yeah and shawty want the gangsters and thugs
And if your bank right shawty gon' be showin' you love
I keep my drank light, Zoovie need a cup full of mud
Yeah, I get money, they be showin' me love

[Chorus: Sean Garrett]
Shawty on that dangerous love
She only fuck with gangsters and thugs
You think it's you but her eyes on those jewels
You think it's cool 'til them niggas come through
She only like that dangerous love
She only fuck with gangsters and thugs
She lookin' for that goon that gon' pull up to that room tonight
That gon' put it in her poom poom poom tonight
