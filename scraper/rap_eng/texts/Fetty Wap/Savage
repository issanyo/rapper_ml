[Intro: Fetty Wap]
Ay, yeaaa yea
Yeaaa yea
Yea, yea, yea

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Yea, ay, pull up on em' on that gang shit, gang shit
See them big wheels when I lane switch, lane switch
Eatin' big meals with the gang bitch, with the gang bitch
Imma big deal, you is average, you is average
You could get killed for a bag quick, bag quick
Keep a stick on me like I'm savage, savage
Ay, boolin' on the block with the rachet, with the ratchet
Ay, better take your shit before we snatch it

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Boolin' on the block with the gang
Yea, and boolin' on the block with my chain
Yea, and boolin' on the block with the thang on me
Yea, love the way it sound when it rain homie
Yea, and boolin' with his thot, he a lame
Yea, and she gave me top, and she came
Yea, and suck me like a mop in the drain
Yea, and brought me from the struggle and the pain
Yea, and I could make it sunny, make it rain
Yea, and nigga you is not gon' do a thing
Yea and, .40, that's a .30 to his brain
Yea, they won't even say his name
Yea, and at the funeral screamin' gang
Yea, and Imma show these niggas why I came
Yea, and Imma show these niggas how to bang
Yea, and Imma Itchy Boy screamin' gang, gang, gang


[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Yea, ay, pull up on em' on that gang shit, gang shit
See them big wheels when I lane switch, lane switch
Eatin' big meals with the gang bitch, with the gang bitch
Imma big deal, you is average, you is average
You could get killed for a bag quick, bag quick
Keep a stick on me like I'm savage, savage
Ay, boolin' on the block with the rachet, wit the ratchet
Ay, better take your shit before we snatch it

[Verse 2: Brazy O]
Two fingers and a thumb, throw it up like I'm retarded
That whip body too big, I ain't got nowhere to park it
This bulldog be small, and they eyes till they barkin'
Anliese them type of G with me, with motherfuckin' chargers
Don't ask me why I stepped up in the Zoo, that's my man though
They say what type of shit you used to? Wooden handle
Type of gangstas round this motherfucker, that's the bando
Where we go .50's play the bitches in my van do
Ace imma hammer, keep it litty, I'm the candle
Everything imma knock it off, that's that ammo
In the streets, yea I be speeding like a Lambo
Throw a bullet at a lil nigga like a lam bro
Pull up on em' on that gang shit, yea that bang shit
Run down on him, hit his whole 9, that's no aimin'
Gold swing around the whole neck, that's that chain shit
I just smoked the green, dead niggas, fuck the famous

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Yea, ay, pull up on em' on that gang shit, gang shit
See them big wheels when I lane switch, lane switch
Eatin' big meals with the gang bitch, with the gang bitch
Imma big deal, you is average, you is average
You could get killed for a bag quick, bag quick
Keep a stick on me like I'm savage, savage
Ay, boolin' on the block with the rachet, wit the ratchet
Ay, better take your shit before we snatch it
