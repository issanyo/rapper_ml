Yeah, it feels so classic
You and me, the magic
And I know we have it
Cause it feels, yeah, it feels, yeah, it feels so classic
Cause it feels, yeah, it feels, yeah, it feels so classic

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Let me talk to you, baby
And I won't be shy
You stole my eyes
I swear you're classy
Must admit you're fine
Somethin' â€˜bout your style
Sweet and sassy
What's on your mind?
Now it's you that's shy
Girl, just ask me
Do you feel this magic?
And the G is blasting
Swear you're something special
Only one over everybody
I'mma love you strong, baby
I'mma love you long, babe
You're my only one, baby
You're the only I want, babe
I'mma love you strong, baby
I'mma love you long, babe

Come to me, baby, don't be shy

[Verse 2]
Oh what a summer time, when we lost our minds
Between the birds and bees
Buzzing under blue skies 'til the full moon rise
Playing with chemistry
Baby, are you with me, oh

Yeah, it feels so classic
You and me, the magic
And I know we have it
Cause it feels, yeah, it feels, yeah, it feels so classic
Cause it feels, yeah, it feels, yeah, it feels so classic
