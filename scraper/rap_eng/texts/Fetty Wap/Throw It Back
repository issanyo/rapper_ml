[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Cause everything you off, I wanna see
I can’t believe you falling for a g’
Cause girl, we only fucking for the moment
Girl, I need you to throw it back
I’m like everything you off, I wanna see
I can’t believe you falling for a g’
Cause girl, we only fucking for the moment
Girl, I need you to throw it back

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
If I roll this wood, girl, I’m gon forget you
You claiming you a hitta, you don’t own a pistol
I couldn't buy one, so I had to get two
And girl, your track slipping so I had to get glue
And I ain’t tryna play you, I ain’t tryna diss you
But, if you sucking my dick, then, I ain’t tryna kiss you
Said bitch, why is you texting asking if I miss you?
Cause if I missed you, bitch, I would’ve hit you
You only gave me top, I ain’t even dicked you
Telling people we together, bitch, that’s the issue
You thought that Benz was mine, bitch, it was a rental
Fucked your sister and your cousin, even fucked your friends too
Said bitch, I’m disrespectful, I thought I should tell you
But I heard that income tax was coming in the mail soon
Look, bitch, I want my money for them damn hotel rooms
Every penny, I’ma flip it, throw it on the ‘gram soon

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Cause everything you off, I wanna see
I can’t believe you falling for a g’
Cause girl, we only fucking for the moment
Girl, I need you to throw it back
I’m like everything you off, I wanna see
I can’t believe you falling for a g’
Cause girl, we only fucking for the moment
Girl, I need you to throw it back

[Verse 2: Khaos]
Got them niggas hating on me ‘cause I got money
Hate them flexing niggas that be moving funny
If you the whip man, best believe, you a lick
Ruger with the beam, that’s about fifty hits
Wylin’ off the shit, me and Fetty drilling shit
Snatching corners, bending shit is my in my Infinity
High as hell sipping lean, barely can’t see
Khaos, hello pussy, dare you to try me
Flipping shit [?]
Bitch, your pussy wet, we was looking like relief
From all these bitches, all I care about is cheese
Had your thot in the back and she on her knees

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Cause everything you off, I wanna see
I can’t believe you falling for a g’
Cause girl, we only fucking for the moment
Girl, I need you to throw it back
I’m like everything you off, I wanna see
I can’t believe you falling for a g’
Cause girl, we only fucking for the moment
Girl, I need you to throw it back
