{Verse 1: Fetty Wap}
Gettin money, all you need to know
You gon be workin shorty
Bitches be flirtin, Zoovie be curvin, only want bags around me
Poppin these tags, and makin them mad, ain’t gettin his package off
Know that I’m M’d up, look at my diamonds, ain’t in my bracket dog
Don’t compare me, niggas ain’t near me, and I don’t brag at all
Niggas don’t scare me, hear me clearly, took a lil break and shit
Niggas be scary, niggas is pussy, actin all fake and shit
And I ain’t have to sellout for them to play my shit
Put me in the background, cause I ain’t back down, came through skatin this shit
It was my first year, now the shit so clear, these niggas ain’t real
Nigga I don’t care, we stay 100, and stay right here
It was my first year, now the shit so clear, these niggas ain’t real

{Verse 2: Monty}
Imma get this money, stack it up, cause that shit what I’m used to
I pull up like, who you, with some niggas that will come and shoot you
These nights be lurkin, they be searchin, they on Google
They see you in person, and they actin like they knew you
I came up with my bros
Now we heatin up without the stove
You could tell that my pockets swole
Two young niggas with the hottest flows
She give me head with ice, I call that brain freeze
They try to take my style, but you ain’t me
I could drop and 8 piece on AP
Bitch, I guess this what the hood made me
Yeah
