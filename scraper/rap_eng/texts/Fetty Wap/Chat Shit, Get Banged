[Verse 1]

C Doggy back with another track
Dropping tracks like ive fucking taken crack
Im Back spitting bars
Whether you think im shit or naah
Dropping bare beats though
Smoking bare weed slow
Man will hit you widda hammer throw;
Chat shit get banged
Chat shit get banged
Chat shit get banged
Chat shit get bang-

[Hook]

Bang them hoes
If they chat shit
And bang them bros
If they chat shit
And watch em fall
Even if they bare tall
And I goth them banged up
C Doggy Dogg they know me
Wish theyd stop tryna throw me
Or ill make bare man flee
Oh Yeah baby -

[Verse 2]

Some people say im savage
But id say im just average
Slaying dealers round the town
You startin to look with a frown
But im  king inda hood doe
And also  in Chicago
I will fuck em up bare bro
You dick head best be scared whoa
Chat shit get banged
Chat shit get banged
Mans round here got potential
But your house council residential

[Hook]

Bang them hoes
If they chat shit
And bang them bros
If they chat shit
And watch em fall
Even if they bare tall
And I goth them banged up
C doggy dogg they know me
Wish theyd stop tryna throw me
Or ill make bare man flee
Oh Yeah baby -

[verse3]

Im back with my last verse
And im king of the fucking universe
I spit some bars drop em hard
Chat shit ill put u in the church yard
You mans cannot touch me
When Im cruising in my m3
Goes to all the fucking haters
Soon ill be racking in the papers
Theyâ€™ll be getting trains for ma pay
This shit is no childs play
Chat shit u know the rules
They even count for you fools
Im the leader of this fucking pack
You bitches best be stepping back
Cos all you know is my name
But one day Ill have bare fame

[Hook]

Bang them hoes
If they chat shit
And bang them bros
If they chat shit
And watch em fall
Even if they bare tall
And I got them banged up
C doggy dogg they know me
Wish theyd stop tryna throw me
Or ill make bare man flee
Oh Yeah baby

Bang them hoes
If they chat shit
And bang them bros
If they chat shit
And watch em fall
Even if they bare tall
And I got them banged up
C doggy dogg they know me
Wish theyd stop tryna throw me
Or ill make bare man flee
Oh Yeah baby
