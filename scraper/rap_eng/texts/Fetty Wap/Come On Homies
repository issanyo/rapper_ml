[Verse 1: Rf Hide]
I started servin 'em mad shades, cuz I didn't have enough

They said don't try and rob 'em cuz they've already been cuffed
Watch out talkin that dumb stuff, or you fnna need some luck
Because of all my fire, you gon' need a firetruck
My boyz ridin with Glocks on, cuz we never had to cluch
Rich Gang ballin, we foreigns, but we run this city bruh
Try and run up on Rich gang, man I swear you must be dumb

Where was all of my homies when, I couldn't leave the hood
'member back in the old days when they didn't help me bruh
Where was all of my homies when, I couldn't get back up
I swear I can't even trust y'all cuz I've been played way too much
Wish you all had been there when my homies got stuck up
My boyz doin some time, and you know they did 'em wrong
They don't even deserve it, the cops just "havin fun"
Now I'm tellin a story, from my homies P.O.V
My homie said he can't do it,  he ain't got a P.O.P
Its a shame what these cops done, cuz they got him M.O.C
And to all of his homies, all I say is R.I.P, yah
