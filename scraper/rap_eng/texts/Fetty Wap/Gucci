[Intro]
Ay, what up man
Yeah, yeah, woah
1738, know how I'm feeling man
Zoovie, swimming

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Yeah I'm from the money Island, Zoovie on his rich shit, yeah
Fuck your baby daddy, I could get you rich bitch, yeah
Got 100,000 on my left and right wrist, yeah
Bitch you ain't never met a nigga like this
I spent most my time in kitchens tryna get the right whip
If I ever get a pigeon I'ma whip it like this
My only dream was ever trapping, ain't believe in rap shit
1000 yam was my goal, ain't need to cap this
I'm a million dollar man, I don't need to cap shit
200,000 in my pants and it barely can't fit
In my hood I'm the man, I don't need to hype shit
Eyes lower than Japan smoking on that kite shit

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Gave my shawty 50 bands cause she treat me nicely
Out here looking like I'm Guwop, I'm so fucking icy
Just like Gucci I'm a dog, all the bitches like me
I might break that nigga jaw if he try to fight me
Out here screaming "fuck the law", I can't let 'em find me
And I'm running with my squad screaming "fuck 'em all", watch me ball
I just bought a chopper, I'm finna spray 'em all, watch 'em fall
100 round drum, I could shoot from close and from far, woah
Fucking icy, looking like I'm Guwop I'm so fucking icy, yeah
They say I'm a dog, all the bitches like me
Break that nigga jaw if he try to fight me, yeah
Skrting, fuck the law, cruising with his wifey, yeah
Bitch I'm Zoovie Zoo, she try to (?) me, yeah

[Interlude: Trouble]
Ay Wap, you know you (?) for a minute you know (?)

[Verse 2: Trouble]
I'm a giant like Guwap but baby I'm just big Trouble
I'm a dog, I'm a dog and yours a dick stuffer
She take Johnson like a fruit then blow on it like Benny Gay
Eat on special cause it's my birthday
You ain't never had a nigga getting money from the brick
Heard your last nigga was a cupcake, ain't shooting shit
All the niggas I run with, know we shooting shit
Couple real ones end up jammed up, few real ones end up hit
(?) ain't nothing but some foreign
Try to get my last kid like my last ho was too boring
We took trips to Hawaii, sliding blowing on some gas
We back from Hawaii, time to get on me some bands

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Yeah I'm from the money Island, Zoovie on his rich shit, yeah
Fuck your baby daddy, I could get you rich bitch, yeah
Got 100,000 on my left and right wrist, yeah
Bitch you ain't never met a nigga like this
I spent most my time in kitchens tryna get the right whip
If I ever get a pigeon I'ma whip it like this
My only dream was ever trapping, ain't believe in rap shit
1000 yam was my goal, ain't need to cap this
I'm a million dollar man, I don't need to cap shit
200,000 in my pants and it barely can't fit
In my hood I'm the man, I don't need to hype shit
Eyes lower than Japan smoking on that kite shit
