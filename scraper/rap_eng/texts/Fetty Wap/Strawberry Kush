(Yeah, yeah, mmh)
Yeah (yeah)

[Chorus]
Love it when I touch you, I can smell you in the air (muah)
I love how you love me, feel your love all the way over here (muah)
I love how you love me got me feelin’ like you care
And the way I think about you evidently make it clear that
I want you forever, so forever I’ll be there
And I really meant forever, baby, not a couple years, baby
That’s a couple fights, yeah, that a couple tears, yeah
That’s a couple nights that Zoovie won’t be there, yeah (Zoovie)
