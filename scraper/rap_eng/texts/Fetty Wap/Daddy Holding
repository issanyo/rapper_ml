[Intro: P-Dice]
Ay, ahhh, ay
They know my..Daddy Holding
But bitch you knew that already, didn't you?
Hahahaha, Sliiice, 38

[Hook: P-Dice]
Roll the dank, spark, give in
Get my change large and win
Til the saints marching in, there they go
Move a 8-ball and rinse
Make them hate hard and glimpse
Til the saints marching in, there they go
Cheddar, baby I'm iced
Yeah you know it, yeah you know it
Hella ladies on Dice
Daddy holding, daddy holding
Two them things in my pint
Yeah you know it, yeah you know it
New Mercedes on Mike's
Daddy holding, daddy holding

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Ay, she just wanna party with a rock star
I'm the dope man, I'm a pop star
I'm a trap god, I'm a block star
Copped a lot of Robins, lot of hot cars
Bitch wanna rock my chain, bitch Remy Boyz my gang
Big ZooWap my name, bi-big ZooWap my name
Bitch wanna rock my chain, bitch Remy Boyz my gang
Big ZooWap my name, big ZooWap my name
[?] love the birds, love the pigeons, Forgiatos when I'm whipping
Black beamer, 26's, no roof, ceiling missing
[?] when she tipsy, ZooWap something different
Hundred million, that's the mission, gotta win, gotta get it
Squad!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: P-Dice]
If I'm dipping out, I mean the chips is out, I'm getting guap involved
You run up in my house, I got the blickies out, there ain't no locking doors
I'm finna ship these out, you know the shit be 'bout 'em, tryna get these bars
I pull the riches out, I heard the bitches out, I'm tryna get me some
All these stacks, you oughta see it, loading gats, my squad the meanest
Got my back, they orthopedic and you know it
All these stacks, they oughta see it, load us gats, my squad the meanest
Got my back, they orthopedic and we holding
I be wearing stacks no matter where I'm at, I'm getting dumb loot
I took a pic with racks and then she hit my jack, she told me come through
I whip a 8-ball 'til it stay hard, then I rinse off
I'm with eight hoes getting faced off 'til my dick soft

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Montana Bucks]
I be holding, I be holding, I be holding
Riding in the Range like it's stolen
And I just popped a gram so I'm rolling
Hit me up cause I got it for the lowest
I ain't gotta tell you cause you know this
Sipping 17, might mix it with the Moet
Might not even drink this shit, I fuck 'round and pour it
When they cut the check, I might just cut me a Rolex
Hundred on the highway, see the cops, I'ma floor it
I got hittas like a turret
And you know we coming for it
Bitch I'm riding, bitch I'm scoring

[Hook]
