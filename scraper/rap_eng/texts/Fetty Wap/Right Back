Gotta get this money, I'll be right back
Fifty in the week, that's a light stack
I'll put you to sleep, that's a nightcap
Priceless, baby you so priceless
Said she ready for me and I might just
Pretty in the face wit a nice butt

Checkin' out my diamonds when they light up
They just broke, they don't really like us
Hella smoke, every time I light up
You never know, who might be the right one

And I be missin' for days
Shit that go on in my brain

Know the name of the gang that I lead, baby
And you gon' break a nigga heart if you leave, baby
But I know what I'm doin' in the streets, baby
Said you gon' break a nigga heart if you leave, baby
When it's over, right back to the queen, baby
