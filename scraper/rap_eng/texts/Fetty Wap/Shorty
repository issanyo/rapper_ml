Hey, peeps

Ay, ay

[Hook]

I'ma call you mine, yeah-ay
He got you waiting for a ringtone, girl, that's not what we on

And now he searching but you so far
Turn up at an old bar, brighter than a moon star, baby

[Verse 1]
You my shorty, you my shorty, I know what she want
Give her a Rollie, a Rollie, with the pink face
Diamonds cold and they frozen, ain't no cheapskate

And it's one woo-woo only, ain't no new friends
That's my baby, she crazy, give her a new Benz
I'm the boss, only fuck with boss bitches, true shit
That's my shorty, she ride with Zoovie, she too lit
And I don't understand, can you help me?
Answer my question, please
It's either him or me, girl
Listen, shorty, ain't no in between
And I love when we sexing, twist and twirl 'em when we in the sheets
But if that's what it is, don't be my bitch when we in the streets

[Hook]
Even though I'm not your man, you not my girl
I'ma call you mine, yeah-ay
He got you waiting for a ringtone, girl, that's not what we on
Show you what it be like, baby
And we be doing everything we ain't supposed to do
And now he searching but you so far
Turn up at an old bar, brighter than a moon star, baby
