I can change your life
I'll change the feel of your body
Lay this pill right on your tongue
Until it kick like karate
I'm miles and miles away
Hotels and late night sex
I'm miles and miles away

[Verse 1: M-80]
Flew out on a late night
Tryna see what it taste like
Jump in the lambo, hit the brake light
Pop a Perc, let a L hit my dab
Cause you wanna get close to me
Come hit the shows with me
Threesomes with hoes with me
Cause I can be all you got
I am everything and more, he's not
Cause I'm high, and you're mine
So I'ma blow your mind baby

[Hook: M-80]
I can change your life
I'll change the feel of your body
Lay this pill right on your tongue
Until it kick like karate
I'm miles and miles away
Hotels and late night sex
I'm miles and miles away
