[Chorus]
I got a thing for lil shawty the way she move
If the ZooWop in your party, I got a tool
I get money, I spend cash on some jewels
Bad bitches, fast cars, touch down, mad yards
I'm a hot boy, I'm running with the Zoos
I can't stop boy, I'm always bustin' moves
Niggas always hating, that's the truth, that's just true
And you ain't doin' somethin' right if you don't keep 'em talkin'

[Verse 1]
Baby you was there but you can keep on walking, yeah
I'm a money chaser, money I be hunting, yeah
When it come to money, baby I be all in, yeah
Come and spend a hundred, it's a lot that I spend
When it comes to getting money you know I'm with the shit
I got a couple niggas clutching, ready to shoot up the strip, yeah
I'ma pop the clutch and go up with his bitch
When you see me it be nothin', on some regular shit
But the paper long as China with a hell of a whip
I keep money all around me, taking hella good trips
Yeah, baby you ain't never had it like this
Yeah, and baby let me light up your wrist, yeah

[Chorus]
I got a thing for lil shawty the way she move
If the ZooWop in your party, I got a tool
I get money, I spend cash on some jewels
Bad bitches, fast cars, touch down, mad yards
I'm a hot boy, I'm running with the Zoos
I can't stop boy, I'm always bustin' moves
Niggas always hating, that's the truth, that's just true
And you ain't doin' somethin' right if you don't keep 'em talkin'
I got a thing for lil shawty the way she move
If the ZooWop in your party, I got a tool
I get money, I spend cash on some jewels
Bad bitches, fast cars, touch down, mad yards
I'm a hot boy, I'm running with the Zoos
I can't stop boy, I'm always bustin' moves
Niggas always hating, that's the truth, that's just true
And you ain't doin' somethin' right if you don't keep 'em talkin'

[Verse 2]
Got a thing for my lil shawty, got a hell of a shape
Got a thing for how she moving, she know I'm in the way
Hit the scene, let's make a movie, we ain't taking a break
And I'm paid, baby you don't care 'cause you on the way
Smoking green and rolling backwoods baby
What you mean this shit is not good baby?
I love the way you back up baby
Beat it down, gonna make you act up baby
I got a thing for my lil lady, baby drive me crazy
Baby even got the three Mercedes, baby whip Mercedes
Prezi on the rim, what I been doin' lately
I been working baby
I been thinkin' 'bout your shit and you know I'm bringing it home
I put a ring around your shit, you the one that I want
I always sing about you, basically the reason I write
I couldn't breath without ya, always been the queen of my life
I couldn't see without ya, think without ya, see what my side

[Chorus]
I got a thing for lil shawty the way she move
If the ZooWop in your party, I got a tool
I get money, I spend cash on some jewels
Bad bitches, fast cars, touch down, mad yards
I'm a hot boy, I'm running with the Zoos
I can't stop boy, I'm always bustin' moves
Niggas always hating, that's the truth, that's just true
And you ain't doin' somethin' right if you don't keep 'em talkin'
