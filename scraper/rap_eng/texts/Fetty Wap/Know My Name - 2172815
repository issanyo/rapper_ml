{Verse 2} M-80
I hoped in the shower then hoped in some pussy then hoped in the shower
Then hoped in the Rari' then met up with Fetty then rode to Rhode Island
All of my niggas took 30's and 40's cause niggas be wildin
Hit up my squad then switched up my car cause lil nigga we ballin
We the squad of the year baby
Pull up and hit your bitch from the rear baby
Only [?] and rocks in my ear baby
Say you wanna rock a nigga chain baby
But first you gotta give a nigga brain baby
But hold up you don't even know my name baby
But we can change all that it's M-80 baby
Motherfucking RGF
Motherfucking Remy Boyz
Motherfucker fuck your squad

{Chorus}
Just met her at the club trynna rock my chain
She wanna ride in my car don't know my name
She wanna rep my set don't know my gang
Girl imma flip that check ain't nothin changed
Cause we're the squad of the year baby
You see the squad over here baby
Girl we're the squad of the year baaby
See the squad over here baaby
