[Hook: Monty]
It's 6 AM and I'm just gettin' in (Damn)
I'm with this bitch, she twerking, doing tricks (Damn)
I hit the mall and don't care what I spend (Damn)
It's Zoo Gang till the fuckin' end

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Zoo Gang coming through, we from the zoo, we moving faster
Hella [?] smoke, my shooters close and they will blast ya
Hit my phone got what you want just bring the cash
Slide through, two different cars, it's the inspector
Once that thing coming, we back on schedule
Did you really think I only have a hit?
That's like saying you a trap god and only sold a brick
Zoovy Zoo from 22nd, Harlem with his shit
Can't wait to flip these checks might free my nigga Rick
My boys was in the car, crash it, walk right from the shit
Don't know how many nightmares I had bought this year
I said fuck all the material, I bought two hundred whips
That's why I'm stacking all this bread, I'm tryna be fucking rich
‘Cause this shit don't last forever, I'm gotta stack this cheddar
Monty Zoo, we living better, brother, what I tell ya?
We was down, we trapping hard and we came up to get it
We was down in the rain, woke up and changed the weather
Monty Zoo and Zoovy Zoo, no one could do it better
Said we was down in the rain, woke up and changed the weather
Monty Zoo and Zoovy Zoo, no one could do it better

[Hook: Monty]
It's 6 AM and I'm just gettin' in (Damn)
I'm with this bitch, she twerking, doing tricks (Damn)
I hit the mall and don't care what I spend (Damn)
It's Zoo Gang till the fuckin' end

[Bridge: Monty]
Now we the boss, too many cars, who would've thought?
We was the ones, Louis Vuitton, Dom Pérignon
Fill up the cup, they show me love, they know what's up
Hoes wanna cuff, don't get fucked, [?]

[Verse 2: Monty]
Everybody want the money, they just want the hunnids
Niggas want the fame but don't want what it come with
Screaming, "Seventeen," you know who I run with
I got these Robins on, I just hope the gun fit
Whiling with the zoo and we just left the airport
If you ain't tryna twerk, baby why you here for?
Don't you hit my line, I hit decline, she still call
And my nigga Zoovy, he up on the billboards
Talking 'bout that money, man that's what we get
Remy and Patron, yeah that's what we mix
Where I'm from, niggas wait for you to slip
Couldn't do it without Zoovy and my nigga Gritt
