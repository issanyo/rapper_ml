[Intro: P-Dice]
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Merry Christmas
Slice, Slice, Sliiice

[Hook: P-Dice]
I drop some thousands on my wrist and it froze
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Few more thousands on my whip, man it’s cold
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
All this flour that I whip by the stove
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Remy Boyz, yeah, we the shit, man you know
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Verse 1: P-Dice]
Slice the illest man you heard
Remy dripping from my fur
Fuck you haters saying [?]
Man I do this on the usual, that’s your girl?
She don’t suck it like she used to, w-w-word
Just tell me what the price is
Just tell me what’s the business
My charm is full of ices
I’m gleaming ya’ll, I glisten
And if you try to swipe it, I’ll leave you with the smith’n
Take you where they ice fish, you sleeping with the fishes
What that flow sound like?
Keep that dough round right
Get your girl, flip her world, make her earl something light
She said no, no, no, I said yo, yo, yo
On her [?] got that bag, I’m like hoe, hoe, hoe

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
I swear that we the best with this
I might flex on my ex with this
I might put on my vest with this
To show them I’m a specialist
How dare you boys come test with this
Zoovier’s no one to wrestle with
My boys, we up, we next with this
My boys come at your neck and shit
You ever disrespecting it
Them 50 cals and techs and shit
I love how that beretta spit
My robin wings on everything
ZooWap, I feel like I’m the shit
Zoowap I ball like Scotty Pippen
Zoowap just signed a fucking deal
ZooWap just let ‘em know it’s real

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Montana Bucks]
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Bitch, I’m balling like I’m playing for the pros
In the Rove smoking dope with your ho
17, this the life that I chose
Rags to riches, I got riches on a roll
Got some bitches, they be whipping on the stove
If they blissing, then I’m gripping from the doe
24’s on the Rove while I coast
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Try to take it, I’ma leave a nigga ghost
And my niggas, they ain’t scared to let it go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Hook]
