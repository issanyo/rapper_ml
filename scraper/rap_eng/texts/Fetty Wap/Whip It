[Hook: Montana Bucks]
Whip it fast, then I whip it slow
Wh-whip it fast, then I wh-wh-whip it slow
Whip it fast, then I whip it slow
Free bricks, remix, come back on a hoe
Whip it fast, then I wh-wh-whip it slow
Wh-whip it fast, then I whip it slow
Wh-wh-whip it fast, then I whip it slow
Free bricks, remix, come back on a hoe

[Verse 1: Montana Bucks]
Ughhh first you whip it fast, then you whip it slow
I be getting cash, I be getting dough
Raspberry jack or the red rose
I'ma hit the gas, ZooWap said go
Uh, whip it like a slave
I'm in the shade sipping lemonade getting brain
Remy Boyz, we give you a rage
Tryna play my niggas, I'll put you in a grave
Monty, bitch you know the name
1738 in some Robin Jeans
Ugh, she do it for the team
Fuck these niggas talking 'bout, you not in my lane, squad!

[Verse 2: P-Dice]
Stashing guap in the toilet, if she don't mop she annoying
I build a block and destroy it, you need a job, I'm employing
Stashing guap in the toilet, if she don't mop she annoying
I build a block and destroy it, you need a job, I'm employing
I need a chick to whip it fast, then she lick it, get a ticket
Take a trip and ship it fast, I'm on a pivot 'bout my digits
All the pigs I'm getting past, Remy Boyz, yeah we here
Kinda sport, pop a cork, let the whore ladies in
Only 'bout my payments, what the fuck you saying?
Only think of living better, we ain't never playing
I'm only 'bout my payments, what the fuck you saying?
Only think of living better, we ain't never playing, eh ah

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
All I rep is 22nd, it got me gotdamn rich
Taught me how to flip a pack and move them gotdamn bricks
Boy if you ain't get no money, hit a gotdamn lick
I rep 12th and 22nd, free my nigga Slick Rick
Big ZooWap from the bando, boy this ain't what you want
Rubber grip on the handle and I shoot shit for fun
Enlighten me where I can't go, boy I pull up where I want
And don't take this out of context like Fetty tryna stunt
Everywhere that my camp go, four of us got a gun
Don't you think that we lacking, the choppa's in the trunk
Hear that shit when it's blasting, I love the way it dump
Used to sleep in the trap house, wake up next to my gun, squad!
