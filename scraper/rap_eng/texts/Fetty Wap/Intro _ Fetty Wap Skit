[Intro: Fetty Wap]
"...be seeing niggas working, my nigga you feel me? Like, and the thing wa-the the reason what made me hit you up was you ain't only got one song, you feel me? Like, you got more than one song and that's where niggas be lacking."

Ay ay Louie Styles, what it do man? Ay man, Squeeze The Mixtape, turn up, you already know, intro shit, let's get it

[Verse: Drebo]
I hopped on the beat and I did what I had
This .45 gonna make your ass freeze like a statue
I ain't looking at you, bitch I'm looking past you
Go crazy, go nuts, boy I'm just like a cashew
My raps, they go hard and they seem like a tattoo
I mess up one time and they claim I'm the bad dude
Got sauce in my walk, boy you think I'm like Ragoo
I want me a Rari, a Benz, and a Jaguar
Don't tell me you can't hear it, no time for the bad news
No matter if she loved me, took off for her last dude
I grew up, got paper, I noticed that cash rules
She fucking the fam, little bitch and they stamped you
I turn up on niggas, yeah just like fan do
Got plugs in the States and my main one in Cancun
Got Luke on the line and he bringing the Lamb through
My bars, they be hot and yours drop like a sandal?
My niggas got drums, they got sticks like a band do
Get money, get rich, that's the shit I plan to
My niggas got choppers that's longer than bamboo
Diamonds on me, them shits cleaner than shampoo
Stepping out boy, I stay draped in designer
Be humble and good, nigga that's a reminder
I got all this paper on me like a binder
I'm looking for her but shit, I cannot find her
