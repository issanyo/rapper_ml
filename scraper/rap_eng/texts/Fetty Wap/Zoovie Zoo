[Intro]
Ayy, yeah baby
Ayy, yeah baby
Ayy, Zoovie, ayy

[Verse 1]
Bitch it's Zoovie Zoo
You gotta fuck with the kid
I am amazing with these hooks
That's why I stay relevant
To anybody who don't like me
Make sure your shit platinum
Past gold 8 times
Now I might go diamond
Young nigga from the hood
Got my whole camp shining
I do not skateboard
But my whole camp grindin'
And I bought Monty a brand new i8
And I swear you should've seen the look on his face

[Hook]
I'm a smooth motherfucker and you know it
Zoovie Zoo up in this show
I roll up the wood and I blow it

[Verse 2]
Remember bitches tryin' play me way back in the days
I got my money right, fresh shape up with the braids
I laid the "Trap Queen"
Them hoes was like "He singin' this shit
Or is it autotune or is he really singing this shit?"
They know the Zoo in every state
Nigga's eatin' heavy plates
17 and all great
ZooGang tatted on my face
RGF then Zoovie straight out my banshee hit 120, ayy
Bitch, I'm GHB come through slidin' and throwin' money, ayy
And I take my business real serious, ain't nothin' funny, ayy
Please do not hit up the Zoo, you ain't got no money, ayy
Only time I do free shit is for the homies and
Just cause you grew up with me don't mean you know me
I remember when I was broke, she wasn't on me
Now I'm up, call me big bank Wap, my money flowin'
Bitch do not get your ass in my car if we ain't fuckin'
If you is, bitch I hope you can cook, cornbread and stuffing

[Hook]
I'm a smooth motherfucker and you know it
Zoovie Zoo up in this show
I roll up the wood and I blow it

[Verse 3]
My new Ferrari sick and it three-hundred and fifty-thousand
Gas not the chickens
Man just keep that shit from 'round me
I don't need a kitchen, man
Pack Karate Kickin' man
Bitch love when we kickin' it
I love when she lickin' it
Ohh, your, ohh your bitch so nasty
She suck me something different
With you she actin' classy
Ain't never let you gettin' lip
With Zoovie, she get ratchet
We get in this business
She tell you to take her to Casa
Don't be late to come and get it
She tell me to hit it slow, then hit it fast, then hit it quick
She make you carry her bags
She know I'm not that type of nigga
You driving a fuckin' Ford
My Rollie is four Chevy's
My chain is an i8
I swear these niggas not ready

[Interlude]
Free stash shit man
1738, ZooGod
Fetty Wap man
2016 you know how we rockin' man
Free Guwop man
Free Guwop man

[Altered Hook]
I'm a smooth motherfucker and you know it
I roll up the wood and I blow it
I get to the cash and you know it

[Outro]
Yeah baby
Yeah baby
Yeah baby
Yeah baby
Is you singin' this shit
They like "is this autotune or is he really singin' this shit"
Zoovie up, my diamonds blingin' this shit
Autotune, I'm singing this shit
I'm a smooth motherfucker and you know it
I get the bands and you know it
Zoovie, Zoovie up and this the one
Yeah baby
