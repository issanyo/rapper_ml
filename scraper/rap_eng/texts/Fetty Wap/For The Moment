[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Girl, I’m tryna fuck you ’til the morning
You know what it is ‘cause you be on it
And I ain’t tryna play, I’m dropping all this
They be tryna rent, I’m tryna own it
Your body got me zoning, molly’s got me rolling
Money I’ma throw it, you already know it
Think I got you open, wetter than an ocean
Don’t catch no feelings ‘cause we only fucking for the moment

[Verse 1: Monty]
Me and my bitch be flexing, them other bitches stressing
She love it when we sexing, she working that perfection
Said I eat it with no question, your body is a blessing
You throw it, I’ma catch it, I got that lethal weapon
They just can’t get enough of us
You got your hair done, I’ma fuck it up
It’s dirty sprite all in my double cup
I’m counting money, I’ma double up
Cause I’m just tryna get between that
I hope you know I really mean that
Girl, don’t act like you ain’t seen that
Cause all you gotta do is lean back
Cause girl, we only fucking for the moment

[Hook]

[Verse 2: P-Dice]
Let’s get high ‘til we weeded, I’m the kind you should be with
The way you slide on the penis make me cry just to see it
Look, shorty, I’m tired of waiting, plus I’m gone off the mollys
They got my eyes dilating, no Coronas inside me
I’m on that Remy for certain, bring your friends for my niggas
Cause they need plenty to flirt with, rubber bands for my bitches
Do shit like that on the regular, cute bitch type bad I’ma catch her
Lose it whenever she ‘round, she got that ebony style
And she got that heavenly smile, got a nigga tripping so different
And her body thick, it’s so vicious
Think I got some dick to go with it
And she got that heavenly smile, got a nigga tripping so different
And her body thick, it’s so vicious
Think I got some dick to go with it
I ain’t tryna rent it, girl, I’m tryna own it
They want you for the minute, they just tryna bone it
You tell me stay around, I’ma stay around
Your exes tryna hate, I’ma lay ‘em down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
Girl, I’m tryna see you, throw it on me
Eyes rolling back like a zombie
Head between your legs, finish my feast
Tryna clean my plate but you won't let me yet
You in tune, this is Fetty station
Baby, can you feel me when I’m penetrating
Girl, I want it now, I’m so tired of waiting
I’m so tired of waiting.. bitch they call me Fetty
My pockets so heavy, I be walking, money steady
Yeaaaaaaaaah
