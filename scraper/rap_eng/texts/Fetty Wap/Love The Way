[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I fucked her till this morning, this morning, this morning
I love it 'cause she boss and she sexy, she horny
I love that she be on me, she on me, she on me
Wake up in the tent, with this somethin shinnin on me
Roll up then I dip, she say make sure you call me
I ain't even trip, hit the whip with the homies
When I hit the road, she be sad 'cause she lonely
She ain't never mad, I get bags and she know me
I'ma do the dash, blowin gas, smokin OG
We be on the tent, said that thing movin slowly
Came out then I changed, left the gang I'ma OG
Wonder why she scream out my name 'cause she know me
He ain't gettin money, he a lame, he don't know me
I'ma be your drug for the night please don't O.D
And I got some thugs, down to ride you don't know me
Always kept a plug on the side for the homies, yeah

[Chorus]
I love the way she doing her thing
She make me wanna say, yeah
I wanna put a rock on your finger
'Cause I've been thinkin girl you know what I mean
I'm not tryna see you walk out and leave, but if it's better for you then it's better for me
You're the only one I see in my future, so even if you go I'ma find you, yeah
Pull up in my vert right behind you, yeah
Tatted on my arm to remind you, yeah
You sit at a height they can't climb to, yeah
Sometimes I make these songs to remind you, yeah, aye
I love the way she doing her thing
She make me wanna say, yeah
I wanna put a rock on your finger
'Cause I've been thinkin girl you know what I mean
I'm not tryna see you walk out and leave, but if it's better for you then it's better for me
