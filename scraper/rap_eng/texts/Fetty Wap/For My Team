[Intro: Fetty Wap]
Ey, Baby-by, baby

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Have you ever had a dream so real
That you felt the life you live was fake
And everything that you've encountered
Was the upgrade you've been needin'?
I swear, I do this for my team, baby
I swear, I do this for my team
I swear, I do this for my team
1738, baby

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Have you ever took a road trip
Is she white, is she brown? I don't know
'Bought give her to the whole damn party
We turn up, don't turn down, shit, they know
Remy Boyz, rockin' Trues and them Robins
She know, I've been Wap, I take off
Got a whole lot of bands in my pocket
I suggest you shake your mans, before I pop him
In the club, 17, bring the bottles
In the car, gettin' top from a model
Everybody turnt, Miley Cyrus
Get your roll on, no motorcycles
Got a 33, bitch, call me Scottie
In the club, 17, bring the bottles
In the car, gettin' top from a model
Everybody turnt, Miley Cyrus
Get your roll on, no motorcycles
Got a 33, bitch call me Scottie
Get your roll on, no motorcycles
Got a 33, bitch, call me Scottie

[Verse 2: Monty]
Monty!
I can take you where you've never been
Girl you lookin' like you heaven sent
I can show you hella bands
Like a dream that would never end
They said my niggas up next now
Every nigga in my set wild
Don't make me lay your ex down
I'm wildin' with the trey pound
Tell him step his game up
Catch me in a Range truck
They don't really make much
Wonder if they change up
I know just what you need
Money ain't everything
These Robins on my jeans
Baby, I'm 17

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Have you ever had a dream so real
That you felt the life you live was fake
And everything that you've encountered
Was the upgrade you've been needin'?
I swear, I do this for my team, baby
I swear, I do this for my team
I swear, I do this for my team
1738, baby
Yeah, baby
