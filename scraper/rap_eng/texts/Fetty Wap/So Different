[Intro]
Swear that sounds like were kissin'
Girl, you’re different (yeah)
Girl, your a blessing (yeah)

[Chorus]
You are so different you blow my mind ow, ow, ow
Just let me kiss your lips one more time ow, ow, I
I just want your body all over mine ow, ow, ow
You are so different you blow my mind ow, ow, ow

[Verse]
I’m always ready to go to war, baby
I got ammunition, leave your clothes at the door, baby
Get it in the kitchen, love it when I hit it slow, baby
See you pillow grippin’ making all your fingers crossin’, baby, you be set trippin’
I'ma work you hard (I'ma work you hard)
Jumpin' out of foreigns, baby (jumpin' out of foreigns, baby)
She doing it right now (she don’t [wanna?] ride it)
So I told her to come outside now (tell her come outside)
He a worker, I'ma boss now
You should know the difference
Screaming fuck the cost now
I know I'ma spend it
Niggas always tryna be down
Reason why I'm friendless
Get up off my steez now
Fuck up out my business

[Chorus]
You are so different you blow my mind ow, ow, ow
Just let me kiss your lips one more time ow, ow, I
I just want your body all over mine ow, ow, ow
You are so different you blow my mind ow, ow, ow

[Outro]
So different you are…
