[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
I'm drinkin' pink champagne out of Sprite bottles, ay
I pour up pints of the lean, baby
Rich days, rich nights and nice models, ayy
Feel like it's all but a dream, baby
I still ain't mastered my skill levels
Bitch said I look cool in my 6 like Bill Russell, ayy
Skinny nigga, my music is all muscle, nigga
I don't carry weight, I just lift it, I don't struggle, ayy
RGF was the greatest gift, ayy
Now I'm cruisin' in the latest whips, ayy
I'm screamin' out like we made it, bitch, ayy
Cause I came from nothin' and niggas know it, ayy
And I came from New Jersey, niggas know it, ayy
And niggas did me dirty and niggas know it, ayy
Now I got all this cash and niggas know it, ayy
Could have had the same chance but he blew it, ayy

[Interlude: Fetty Wap]
Yeah baby, whoa
Yeah baby, whoa, ayy whoa, ayy
Could have had the same chance but niggas blew it, ayy
Had the same chance but niggas blew it, ayy
You could have had the same chance but boy you blew it, ayy
I'd like to thank my fans
Because of you guys I do what the fuck I want
Man and it feels fuckin' good
1738! Squaaaad!

[Verse 2: House Party]
Niggas send threats when we see 'em, it's never nothin'
And every coupe I jump inside, shit start with a button
My niggas on my side, so you could never touch me
You niggas bark, no bite, I swear this shit is funny
You niggas suspect, got bands I ain't touched yet
Mont just bought a car and we don't know where the trunk at
Can't see where the love at cause all we see is hate
My whole team a bunch of shooters
Zoo Curry, we Golden State now
Back rubs, Versace lotion, your bitch is crazy with it
I can get your bitch right now, bet you 80 hit it
Wap just bought a brand new car, he's in Mercedes, nigga
Just know that when I pull out, I ain't playin' with you
Used to be the nigga they play
Now I'm a fat mothafucka that got bitches for days
We could go toe to toe any night, any day
Or we could go flow to flow, however you wanna play, ay
