[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Do this for my hood, I do it for Zoo Jersey
Pull up in a foreign, I’m skirting, it’s too purty
Funny moving niggas be making the Zoo nervous
Stay the fuck from ‘round me you pussy, your crew worthless
Phone keep ringing, you’re calling man too early
Only way I answer you’re bringing me two birdies
I’m very well known, I don’t think that you heard me
I’m known from down the hill way up to two thirty
Ninety-five Air Max ‘cause I’m a dope runner
Balling an athlete but got no jumper
Ayy, want a bad bitch, gotta have bricks
Want a bad bitch, gotta have bricks
Ninety-five Air Max ‘cause I’m a dope runner
Balling an athlete but got no jumper
Ayy, want a bad bitch, gotta have bricks
Yeah that makes sense, and I make hits
Free the king, Gucci Guwop
Hit the scene, hit a duwop
See the beam on my new Glock
Robin jeans, got a smooth flock
Free the king, Gucci Guwop
Hit the scene, hit a duwop
See the beam on my new Glock
Robin jeans, I be too fly

[Verse 2: Frenchie]
See a nigga looking with a face this
But I’m still cooking in the kitchen with an apron
The bitches, yeah I fuck ‘em like a caveman
I bet this forty cal make a nigga break dance
First of all I gotta thank Guwop
Yeah I said Guwop, you know I had to say it two times
Got a hundred grand in the shoebox
And I got two Glocks in case a nigga like you try
F R E N, C H I E
I don’t even need an ID
For me to get in the club, I put a nigga on an IV
I’m fed up
Me and Fetty Wap ‘bout to get up
The top 1017 with a 38
If you hating on the squad, shut up

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
Set my bitch ass on the [?] list
I ain’t tryna hear no excuses
Zoo Gang, this how we do this
All my niggas fucking ruthless
Set my bitch ass on the [?] list
I ain’t tryna hear no excuses
Zoo Gang, watch how we do this
Me and Monty comin’ through bitch

[Verse 4: Monty]
I’m countin’ hundreds baby ‘cause I’m 17
Dope charges, it’s just a felony
Want a bad bitch, gotta have bricks
Hope that make sense, and I make hits
I’m countin’ hundreds baby ‘cause I’m 17
Dope charges, it’s just a felony
Want a bad bitch, gotta have bricks
Hope that make sense, and I make hits
Want a bad bitch, gotta have bricks
Talkin’ ass tits, ridin’ fast whips
All that cash get, gon’ get that ass hit
Who you came with, you know my name bitch
I might lane switch with the gang bitch
She not my main bitch, man who you came with
Uh, uh, shout out Gucci Mane bitch
Uh, uh, shout out Gucci Mane bitch
