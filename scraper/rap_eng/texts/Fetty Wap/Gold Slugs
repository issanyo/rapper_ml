[Chorus: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
She loves a nigga with them gold slugs, gold slugs
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' (Khaled, I see you my nigga)
She loves a nigga with them gold slugs (Ha), gold slugs
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time (Oh)
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
She love the way, she love the way
Oh, she loves the way, the way it feels, yeah
When her body touch, her body touch your grill

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Ha, I'ma pull up when she call me (Yeah, yeah)
Baby you know I don't pull out when we lovin'
Touchin', kissin' and lickin'
Always leavin' your panties or somethin' else
In my crib or my whip
I'm shinin' with this gold grill
I could give a fuck how you feel
The ass and them titties on the real
I took her back to my block, nigga, my hood
Now everybody, everybody like, "Damn that girl look good"
And every nigga in the squad gon' keep it 100
She can tell that I'm a boss and I tell her
She loves it, oh, she loves the grill

[Chorus: Chris Brown, DJ Khaled & August Alsina]
She loves a nigga with them gold slugs, oh, gold slugs
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time

Yeah, she love a nigga with them gold slugs, gold slugs
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time (Gold)
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time (Oh, oh)
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time (Same damn time)
She love the way, she, she love the way, she
Oh, she loves the way, the way it feels (Her body)
When her body touch, her body touch your grill (Oh, woah)

[Verse 2: August Alsina & DJ Khaled]
When I'm hittin' and grillin' you know she love that
Call her semi-automatic 'cause she bust back
And it's time she my now and later
She be beggin' me to annihilate her (Oh, oh)
When it's over she'll need the undertaker, killed that
Your body's shakin', girl, I feel that
It's mine forever, we grind together
And when you put them slugs in, we even shine together
And I love that and I think she knows that
Whenever she around it, gotta go down (Go down)
She said she only fuckin' with them thugs (Thugs)
But nobody handcuffin', baby, no doubt (Ooh, woah)
'Cause we both know what it was, she loves

[Chorus: Chris Brown, DJ Khaled, August Alsina & (Fetty Wap)]
She loves a nigga with them gold slugs, gold slugs
Oh, she loves a nigga with them gold slugs

I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time
(Gold slugs) I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin'
She loves a nigga with them gold slugs, gold slugs
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time (Same time)
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time (Oh, woah)
I'm grillin' and I'm fuckin' at the same time (Same damn time)
She love the way, love the way, she love the way (Yeeeah)
Oh, she loves the way, the way it feels (Yeeeah baby, ohh)

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap & DJ Khaled]
I brought out the Zoo, I'd act a fool for you, baby (Yeeeah baby)
I set 'em down, take 'em to school for you, baby (Yeeeah baby)
Bustin' out the window, when I'm feelin' you, baby
And people say we crazy, just the shit we do, baby (Yeeeah baby)
And she love a hood nigga, show her how to flip it
Everybody stingy, yeah, we stackin' and we spendin'
Ayy, it sound like a water slide when I’m in it
And we 'bout business so we know let's get it
And we love gold slugs, baby
I beat it up, gold gloves, baby
And let 'em talk, they don’t know nothin', baby (Yeeeah)
These niggas broke tryna hold somethin' baby (Yeeeah)
