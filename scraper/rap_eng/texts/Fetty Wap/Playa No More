[Intro]
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be yeah

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be
Don't wanna be a playa
I get money that's all I know
You rolling with me
You the one imma change for
I ain't tryna play games no more
I don't wanna be
Don't wanna be a playa
I get money that's all I know
You rolling with me
You the one imma change for
I ain't tryna play games no more
Cause I, don't wanna be a playa no more
I think I found someone i live my life for
Cause I, don't wanna be a playa no more
I think I found someone i live my life for
I'm yours, your mine, for sure

[Verse 1]
Girl I swear I'm tryna play around
Glad i got you here to hold me down
You da one a nigga need around
Said you smoke, we goin' pound for pound
Imma roll this, we don't need a light
You gone roll with me we leave tonight
You get rocks and rings, you need the ice
I got lots of chains, don't need the lights
Girl I swear I'm tryna play around
Glad i got you here to hold me down
You da one a nigga need around
Said you smoke, we goin' pound for pound
Imma roll this, we don't need a light
You gone roll with me we leave tonight
You get rocks and rings, you need the ice
I got lots of chains, don't need the lights

[Verse 2]
Girl I'm really doin' my thing
But I'm tryna be doin' my thing with ya
Shawty tryna hug on my chain
But I'd rather be giving my name to ya
Girl really digging yo frame
I'm yo side, best friend, and main nigga
Let a nigga trip on our {???}
Swear its gon' feel like Liu Kang, hit 'em

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be
Don't wanna be a playa
I get money that's all I know
You rolling with me
You the one imma change for
I ain't tryna play games no more
I don't wanna be
Don't wanna be a playa
I get money that's all I know
You rolling with me
You the one imma change for
I ain't tryna play games no more
Cause I, don't wanna be a playa no more
I think I found someone i live my life for
Cause I, don't wanna be a playa no more
I think I found someone i live my life for
I'm yours, your mine, for sure
