[Intro: Montana Bucks]
Uhhh, yeah, 1738
Montana and Fetty Cash

[Hook: Montana Bucks]
I was sittin’ in the trap thinking about how I’ma get this nigga
Guwap got the drop, he been plotting for a minute
Let’s go get the yoppa nigga, we gon’ run up in it
Take two to the head, bang-bang then he finished

[Verse 1: Montana Bucks]
Bitch, they call me Monty, everything authentic
Riding, windows tinted, all I know is get it
Ferragamo, Bentley, jamas call me Jimi Hendrix
Said I’ma go hard like it’s 4th and inches
I said count it up and spend it, count it up and spend it
Come to my society, you see why I’m a menace
We got all varieties, just hit me if you with it
Ain’t nobody high as me ‘cause I ain’t got no limit
Run up in your property, bang-bang then, you finished
Choppa on the side of me in case a nigga slipping
All I know is robbery and crack heads in my kitchen
All I know is robbery and crack heads in my kitchen

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
All I do is stack dough, I stack up like Pringles
I just left the bando, I’m calling my niggas
Hit me with the big birds, talking ‘bout the eagles
Riding in my trap car, 6’s on ‘em wheels
Trap hard just like Michael Jordan, James like the sequel
Every time I’m with your bitch, she wearing something see-through
He said he trap but, where you at? ‘cause I do not believe you
I roll through where you homies at and I ain’t even see you
You fuck around with them fuck niggas, you fuck around and get whacked
You fuck around with us rich niggas, you fuck around and get racks
You fuck around with them fuck niggas, you fuck around and get whacked
You fuck around in my kitchen, you fuck around and cook crack
Fetty Cash
