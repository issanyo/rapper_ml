[Intro]
Ooh, shit be drippin' juice
That's just what I do
Ooh, left wrist drippin' juice
That's just what I do, nigga
Ooh, I just bought a tool
I can't wait to shoot, nigga
Nigga, ooh (haha)
Bitch
[?]

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Bitch I'm riding with my mothafuckin' chauffeur (skrrt, skrrt)
Count a hundred G's in my loafers (money)
Make a hundred plays with my broker (a hundred)
Who the fuck is he?
I don't know, skrrt (skrrt, skrrt)
Riding with my mothafuckin' chauffeur (skrrt, skrrt)
Count a hundred G's in my loafers (skrrt, skrrt)
Make a hundred plays with my broker (shmoney)
Who the fuck is he?
I don't know, skrrt (Zoovie)

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Bitch I'm from the 12
Fuck a scale, I cut work up well
Came from bustin' sales
Fetty Cash, bitch they know me well
Really from the trap this ain't no mothafuckin' fairy tale
Her face up in my lap I grip the mothafuckin' steering wheel
Ay homie, it's a problem, we can't shoot
I got homies watchin' from the roof
Looking at my engine it's a coupe (skrrt, skrrt)
You got homies, I got homies too
You ain't gettin' money, bitch, get on my level
Such a gold digger, tell that bitch get a shovel
Know some niggas, had a shootout, then he told on his brother
Rat ass nigga, you a cold motherfucker

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Bitch I'm riding with my mothafuckin' chauffeur (skrrt, skrrt)
Count a hundred G's in my loafers (cash)
Make a hundred plays with my broker
Who the fuck is he?
I don't know, skrrt (skrrt, skrrt)
Riding with my mothafuckin' chauffeur (skrrt, skrrt)
Count a hundred G's in my loafers (cash)
Make a hundred plays with my broker (aye)
Who the fuck is he? (yeah)
I don't know, skrrt (Zoovie)

[Bridge: Fetty Wap]
Ooh, left wrist drippin' juice
That's just what I do, nigga
Ooh, left wrist drippin' juice
That's just what I do, nigga
Ooh, I just bought a tool
I can't wait to shoot, nigga
Nigga, ooh, I just bought a coupe
Where the fuck the roof, nigga

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
I got killers in my mothafuckin' backyard
Grew up in the trenches, I don't act hard
Nigga think I'm pussy, I'll smack y'all
Pull up in a hooptie, let the MAC off
I just hit the mall with the black card
Had to spend a fifty, write the tax off
Million in a month, bitch I trap hard
I get what I want, I don't act, dawg
GANG
