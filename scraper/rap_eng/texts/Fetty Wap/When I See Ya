I got more money than your nigga do
Girl you ain't worry bout it
We be still fuckin' around and I got a bitch too
You ain't worry 'bout it

All we do is fuck when I see ya
Girl we gon' fuck when I see ya (girl we gone fuck)
All we do is fuck when I see ya

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
You said that sorry ass nigga ain't hit it right
I came through, I fucked all on you, had you feelin' right
I brought the weed, you had the drank
We got dumb lit
We turned the music up loud so they can't hear
Cause you be loud as a bitch when I'm deep in that shit
If my bitch find out I be pleadin' the fifth
Why your home girls say we pull off in the four
Them bitches ain't got any money
Them bitches can't tell you nothing

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I got more money than your nigga do
Girl you ain't worry bout it
We be still fuckin' around and I got a bitch too
You ain't worry 'bout it
Ohh ohh ohh, we ain't worry bout it
Cause we gon' fuck when I see ya (girl we gon' fuck)
All we do is fuck when I see ya (we gon' fuck)
Girl we gon' fuck when I see ya (girl we gon' fuck)
All we do is fuck when I see ya
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
We be goin' all night girl
Droppin' them drawers, puttin' holes in the walls
You a freak and I like that girl
Come ride with a boss, blow a check at the mall
So you can leave your man at home
I'm just tryna play baby, I ain't tryna waste no time
We ain't got all day baby, hit it then I press rewind
Won't you come my way baby
Got way more money than y'all
Nigga ain't got no bank, baby
Sneak up from behind 'em, dancing while we singing
You ain't never met a nigga like me
Girl you know my name baby

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I got more money than your nigga do
Girl you ain't worry bout it
We be still fuckin' around and I got a bitch too
You ain't worry 'bout it
Ohh ohh ohh, we ain't worry bout it
Cause we gon' fuck when I see ya (girl we gon' fuck)
All we do is fuck when I see ya (we gone fuck)
Girl we gon' fuck when I see ya (girl we gon' fuck)
All we do is fuck when I see ya
Yeah, yeah, yeah
