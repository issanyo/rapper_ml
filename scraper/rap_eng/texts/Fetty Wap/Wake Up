[Intro]
1738
Tellin' you guys how I feel man...

[Hook]
When you wake up in the mornin', ayy
Mom's yellin' in your room
Like can I get 5 more minutes?
Shit, I ain't really trippin' over school
Let's get Wiz Khalifa high and
Get meditated over medicated
Get Wiz Khalifa high and
Throw your caps in the air like you know you made it, ayy
When you wake up in the mornin', ayy
Mom's yellin' in your room
Like can I get 5 more minutes?
Shit, I ain't really trippin' over school
Let's get Wiz Khalifa high and
Get meditated over "Medicated"
Get Wiz Khalifa high and
Throw your caps in the air like you know you made it

[Verse 1]
I told moms I ain't trippin' over school cause I made it
Said, "Boy you got a son, supposed to be his inspiration"
Put a milli' in his bank account
Don't leave him out I was thinkin'
I'll never do him wrong like they did the operation
Took a nigga's vision from him, was a mothafuckin' baby
Said a couple years later they can give it back to me
Technology is movin' too slow, I'm waitin' patiently
Shit, I don't want it no more, this how I'm meant to be
Remember young kids in the school used to laugh at him
Guess I played my numbers real good, check the mathematics
Niggas broke and Zoovie Zoo up, why they mad at him?
Man I bought about 12 cars just to blast past 'em
Switch cars so much, they don't know which one to blast at
And my bitch so bad and you know her ass fat
Wanna ride through and they is who I'll laugh at
Zoo Gang my crew, won't put nothin' past that

[Hook]
When you wake up in the mornin', ayy
Mom's yellin' in your room
Like can I get 5 more minutes?
Shit, I ain't really trippin' over school
Let's get Wiz Khalifa high and
Get meditated over "Medicated"
Get Wiz Khalifa high and
Throw your caps in the air like you know you made it, ayy
When you wake up in the mornin', ayy
Mom's yellin' in your room
Like can I get 5 more minutes?
Shit, I ain't really trippin' over school
Let's get Wiz Khalifa high and
Get meditated over "Medicated"
Get Wiz Khalifa high and
Throw your caps in the air like you know you made it

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, baby, yeah, yeah baby

[Hook]
When you wake up in the mornin', ayy
Mom's yellin' in your room

Shit, I ain't really trippin' over school
Let's get Wiz Khalifa high and
Get meditated over "Medicated"
Get Wiz Khalifa high and
Throw your caps in the air like you know you made it, ayy
When you wake up in the mornin', ayy
