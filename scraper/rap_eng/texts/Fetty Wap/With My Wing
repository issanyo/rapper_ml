[Hook: Monty]
You could ride, but I fly with my wings
With the squad, bumping sharks in the tank
Hit the mall, spend it all, hit the bank
Remy Boyz, 1738

[Verse 1: Monty]
I'm chilling at the jugg spot, ZooWap got the hood hot
Wish a nigga would try, chopper hit him, bulls eye
Tryna get a quick flip, couple hoes nitwit
I'm young and I'm gifted, gun where my hip is
It come with extensions, her tongue where my dick is
I'm all about my riches, I don't play the benches
Baby I'm a starter, gotta work harder
Where I'm from, they'll line you up like your barber
Feeling like I'm Weezy, bitch, I'm feeling like tha Carter
Plus she call me Daddy but I'm nothing like her father
Bitches they don't love you, they just love for your dollars
Don't make me call my goons up, they might go retarded

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
We could fly, we could ride, we could smoke, baby
Rolling woods, rolling woods, hit the do', baby
Fuck you thought? Zoo Gang walking in, baby
Throwing fifties, collect twenties, save the tens, baby
All hundreds when I spend 'em on my Robins, ay
Big Benz, baby, ZooWap, know I got 'em, ay
Me and Monty going in, we go retarded, ay
All these bitches wanting us, we fuck 'em all, ay
Pull up in my Benz, fuck her and her friends
All about my ends, stack the Benjamins
Pull up in my 'Rari, pull up in my 'Rari
Bitches go retarded, bitches go retarded, yeah baby
