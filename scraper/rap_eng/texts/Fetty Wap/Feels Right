[Intro: Fetty Wap]
Yeah, yeah baby
Yeah, aye, aye

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Ain't nothing bout this right, but
I can make you feel so good baby
I ain't your ordinary type
When I'm in, I make you feel so good baby
You know it's hard to find your type
And you just what I like, yeah
I just wanna make you mine baby
Facetime me or Skype me
Whatever you like please
I ain't trying waste your time baby
Ain't nothing bout this right, but
I can make you feel so good baby
I ain't your ordinary type
When I'm in, I make you feel so good baby
Yeah baby

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
You got a walk from heaven, aye
Might be where you fell from
Sure, you more like a blessing, aye
Eating you girl, that's well done
You became my profession, aye
Hold you tight compression, aye
Sitting pretty in the section, aye
Black dress with them heels on
Can you ride till the wheels go?
You the one I drop bills on
You was there when I was damn broke
Now you got a couple wheels don't cha'?
Hate them 20 dollar bills don't cha'?
Hand her kindly 2 mill baby
Zoovie Zoo too real baby
California in the hills baby

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Ain't nothing bout this right, but
I can make you feel so good baby
I ain't your ordinary type
When I'm in, I make you feel so good baby
You know it's hard to find your type
And you just what I like, yeah
I just wanna make you mine baby
Facetime me or Skype me
Whatever you like please
I ain't trying waste your time baby

[Verse 2: Monty]
Huh
Late night, early morning
You the one I'm callin'
Don't be tryna stallin'
Catch you when you fallin'
Climbing up the walls and
That pussy, I fall in
If I wasn't ballin'
Would she still be all-in?
You look so bad, but that pussy so good
If it don't last, baby girl you know what?
I need more gas, and I need some po' up
My whip's so fast and I got the dozer

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Ain't nothing bout this right, but
I can make you feel so good baby
I ain't your ordinary type
When I'm in, I make you feel so good baby
You know it's hard to find your type
And you just what I like, yeah
I just wanna make you mine baby
Facetime me or Skype me
Whatever you like please
I ain't trying waste your time baby

[Verse 3: Monty & Fetty Wap]
Th-think you wanna ride?
All those summer nights
Baby, yeah I know you
And I wonder why?
'Cause you bad as hell
Got 'em mad as hell
If the money goes
Will my honey stay?
Drop top, two beamers baby
Zoo, am I who you see baby?
Kinda hot with this jewelry on me
ZooGod, ZooGang, they on me
RGF, my niggas want me
And they mad baby, aye
100k, go ahead and throw it in the bag baby, yeah

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
Ain't nothing bout this right, but
I can make you feel so good baby
I ain't your ordinary type
When I'm in, I make you feel so good baby
You know it's hard to find your type
And you just what I like, yeah
I just wanna make you mine baby
Facetime me or Skype me
Whatever you like please
I ain't trying waste your time baby
