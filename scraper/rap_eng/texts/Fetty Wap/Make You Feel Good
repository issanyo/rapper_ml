[Verse 2]
I need a chance, let me love you right
Licking you on ice
Do it twice, type of shit she like
Leavin' on the lights
See a lamp, shawty say do work
Find her in the night
What you like?
All I got is time, I'ma spend it right
In the hills I just roll the wood, I just need a light
If it's cool, you could bring a bag, let you spend the night
All that bullshit, I ain't on that, cause you right
In Chanel bags, coppin' car keys, shit you like
(Squad!)
