[Chorus]
I can make you feel so good, gotta make you want it
I can make you feel so good, watch how you jump on her
I can make you feel so good, this is not a loaner
Baby I'm the owner
We can hit some corners

[Verse 1]
Ooh, she says she like me, I think she might
She lookin' right, come be my wifey
She just my type, she got me hype, she right beside me
Don't take her lightly
Love it when she bite me
I keep her so icy
Ooh, I think she likes me, I think she might
She lookin' right, come be my wifey
She just my type, she got me hype, she right beside me
Don't take her lightly
Love it when she bite me
I keep her so icy

[Chorus]
I can make you feel so good, gotta make you want it
I can make you feel so good, watch how you jump on her
I can make you feel so good, this is not a loaner
Baby I'm the owner
We can hit some corners

[Verse 2]
Money in the bank, that's right
We can pick a state and fly
Ice or roller skate, let's glide
Ayy, ayy, yeah baby
Fuckin' up the paint on the ride
Fuckin' up the whip and inside
You can get this dick every night
Ayy, ayy, yeah baby

[Bridge]
Oh, we can hit some corners

[Verse 3]
Baby only call when she want it
Baby I'm the one with the money
You can hit my phone in the mornin'
Baby only call when she horny
We can go and ball like it's nothin'
Baby, I'm the one, I be stuntin'
Diamonds on my wrist, yeah they floodin'
Baby, I'm the one you should fuck with
Your ex nigga lame, baby
So it's a shame, baby
Bought a brand new chain, baby
Tell a nigga, stay in his lane, baby
Got money in the bank, baby
All hundreds on the sink, baby
All white without the drain, baby
If the summertime dark, wear the pink, baby

[Outro]
Yes you baby I'll admit to you, I got hoes on every corner
Your nigga ain't this, your nigga ain't shit, your nigga is borin' baby
Yeah
