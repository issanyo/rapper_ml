[Intro: Fetty Wap]
Zoo Gang, baby
Yeah, baby
Yeah

[Chorus: Skinnyfromthe9]
I got all this Sprite, baby, I been sippin' lean, ayy
I don't wanna fight, I'ma fuck you off a bean, ayy
See you in my dreams, bitch, my money green
Let me see you throw it back, put it all on me
Girl, you movin' too fast, this might be a fling
I don't rock no durags, but a nigga clean

[Verse 1: Skinnyfromthe9]
If I fly you out, come into my house
I'ma put it down and fuck you on the couch
Told me goin' scuba, call that bitch an Uber
Shot down with my shooters, ain't no way that I'ma lose your
She just wanna fight, I just want a Sprite
Girl, don't call my phone up 'less you want the pipe
Your ex-man is a loser, he can't do it right
Baby girl, I'm cooler, look at all this ice
Oh, whoa
Oh, oh-oh-oh
We can do it right
We can do it right

[Chorus: Skinnyfromthe9]
I got all this Sprite, baby, I been sippin' lean, ayy
I don't wanna fight, I'ma fuck you off a bean, ayy
See you in my dreams, bitch, my money green
Let me see you throw it back, put it all on me
Girl, you movin' too fast, this might be a fling
I don't rock no durags, but a nigga clean

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Your ho scream out Zoo Gang, you gon' roll with me, ayy
You gon' pop like two things, I'm gon' pop like three, ayy
Look at how I do things, you gon' wanna see, ayy
And I count the blue things, and I count the green
I could do this every day now, baby, ayy
And I got money, make you straight now, baby, ayy
The type I gotta make you stay 'round, baby, ayy
And I get guap, don't ever play 'round, baby, ayy
So tell me where you wanna go-ooh-oh-oh-oh
I got money I could blow-ooh-oh-oh-oh
Baby, you don't even know-ooh-oh-oh-oh
You don't even know-ooh-oh-oh-oh
I been wearin' all my jewels, that's ice, baby
You could pick a coupe, let's slide, baby
Always catch the Zoo outside, baby
Throw the money out the roof, let's ride, baby, yeah

[Chorus: Skinnyfromthe9]
I got all this Sprite, baby, I been sippin' lean, ayy
I don't wanna fight, I'ma fuck you off a bean, ayy
See you in my dreams, bitch, my money green
Let me see you throw it back, put it all on me
Girl, you movin' too fast, this might be a fling
I don't rock no durags, but a nigga clean

[Outro: Skinnyfromthe9]
I don't rock no durags
I don't rock no durags, but a nigga clean
Girl, you movin' too fast, this might be a fling
Too fast, yeah-eah
