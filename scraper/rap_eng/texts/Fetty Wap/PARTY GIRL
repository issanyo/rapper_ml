[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
When she hit my phone I'm comin' through tonight baby
When I pick you up hop in my coupe tonight baby
Don't fuck with him cause he don't do it right baby
Girl I got them bands, I heard his pockets light baby
It'll never end, girl we can spend all night baby
If you're wit it we can take a ride baby
We can ride into the morning, night, baby
Right after I hit it twice, yeahhh baby

[Verse 1: Bankhead]
Shorty all crazy that ass so fat
My fitted cocked lazy dressed in all black
Big ball swag baby we don't do prada
Belts be Chanel my shoes balenciaga
Young niggas winnin' we touchin' on papers
Stompin' on gators, stuntin' on haters
B-Big face spendin' wit thick waist women
Hats wit snakes in em my belts got H in em
Her pants all tight while that ass shake in it
She ride good dick like she got Jamaic-in  her

A freak in the sheets she creep wit two girls

Throw Wap on the track and he tell em yeah baby
Throw Wap on the track and he tell em yeah baby


[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
When she hit my phone I'm comin' through tonight baby
When I pick you up hop in my coupe tonight baby
Don't fuck with him cause he don't do it right baby
Girl I got them bands, I heard his pockets light baby
It'll never end, girl we can spend all night baby
If you're wit it we can take a ride baby
We can ride into the morning, night, baby
Right after I hit it twice, yeahhh baby
