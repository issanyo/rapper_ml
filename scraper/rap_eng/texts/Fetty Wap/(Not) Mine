(Intro fade// Fetty Wap)
I’m like, yeah, she’s fine
Wonder when she’ll be mine
She walk past, I press rewind
To see that ass one more time
And I got this sewed up
And I got this sewed up

I’m like, yeah, she’s fine
Wonder when she’ll be mine
She walk past, I press rewind
To see that ass one more time
And I got this sewed up
And I got this sewed up
And I got this sewed up

(Verse 1) Noyboyy
You be on my mind every day and everynight
You be the last person that I text to everynight
In the morning you look so good without makeup, Jesus Christ
And when I have a problem you know how to make it damn right
Cuz youre genius, 2017, acting like Julius
Hair straight up in a bun, maybe even ponytails
Gettin and obsession but obsessions are absurd
Wonderin why no other guy calls you their girl
But its sure, you have higher expectations than the usual
Make sense for the act, that the pressure is just new for you
Hope you won't get used, just for the views on the weekly news
So you gather slowly, get boys like a minitude
I understand your passion for achieving your best
But why you gotta hang with my friends I call my best
Causing troubles, you be in the start of the trouble
Then you be actin high to fit in, not even in the treble

(Hook// Fetty Wap)
I’m like, yeah, she’s fine
Wonder when she’ll be mine
She walk past, I press rewind
To see that ass one more time
And I got this sewed up
And I got this sewed up

(Verse 2) Noyboyy
Eh, you know me best, you know what makes me sad
Dont see how I see you, what makes me glad
I watch out for you, who is your dad
Probs not papa tocc cuz hes not a lad
Cuz his smallest daughter didn't follow the plan
The oldest one is good, smarter than chan
Association cold, but it starts with an A
Never ask me how im doing, id still say okay
Id say okay cuz I know you dont care
You rarely ask and when you ask, im not there
Dont say a word but answer the snap
Say im not invited, but lay next to his lap
I still love you and im still trying
To be a good guy in a moment of violence
But contradiction has led me to this final line
Im not me if youre not mine

(Outro// Fetty Wap)
I’m like, yeah, she’s fine
Wonder when she’ll be mine
She walk past, I press rewind
To see that ass one more time
And I got this sewed up
And I got this sewed up

I’m like, yeah, she’s fine
Wonder when she’ll be mine
She walk past, I press rewind
To see that ass one more time
And I got this sewed up
And I got this sewed up
And I got this sewed up
