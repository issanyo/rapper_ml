[Verse 1:]
Two fifths of Patron and we gone baby
We be fuckin' till the morning baby
Cause girl you got the biggest one
Can I come over and get me some
Bout to DM you my digits ma
Zoovier, I'm about my benjis ma
What time would you like me to hit it ma
Ayy, shawty had to hit me around 2 somethin'
Hit it back and she was like oooh nothin'
Saw you earlier and your whole crew stuntin'
Pick me up later, we gon' do somethin'
Two hoes and they like they boobs touched
Let you hold the work but don't lose nothin'
Ayy, baby I'm cool runnin'

[Verse 2:]
Attention to all the girls in here
That say they fuck with me, yeah baby
Cause if I bring you to the crib
You better not fuck with me, yeah baby
Cause this ain't shit that I just do
Cause my bitch gon' whoop your ass
If I see you post a picture up
Then I'ma come get your ass
Then she answer, said "baby I ain't with that shit"
So I strapped up, bent her over, hit that shit
And she lookin' like "damn boy, you meant that shit"
I'm running in the pussy like cool running
Ayy, you hotter than two ovens
Tryna fuck my bitch, you buggin'
Ayy, I'm Zoovier, I can get you bent up quick
And try to take my grip you'll feel the handgun quick
Shake it fast, but watch the pot
Scrape the sides, collect the drop
Wap!

Coming with this fire like HIYAH
