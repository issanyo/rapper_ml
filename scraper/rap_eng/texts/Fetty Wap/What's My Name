[Intro: P-Dice]
Ay, yeah, let’s go
Haha, they know my name, know my name

[Hook: P-Dice]
Every time she go, find her way right back
Girl, your shit like whoa, can’t get enough of that
Invite her to my house, Remy and Rosé
I’m gon fuck you now, tell me what’s my name
What’s my name? What’s my name?
What’s my name? Tell me what’s my name
What’s my name? What’s my name?
What’s my name? Tell me what’s my name

[Verse 1: P-Dice]
I be going off, can’t even compare
Headed to my house, you should me meet there
You ‘member the way, you ‘member the way
Because lately girl, you been on my brain
Rub your body slow, rub your body slow
Once I pull your hair, ain’t no letting go
Girl, P-Dice in town, girl, P-Dice in town
Hoes don’t need to fuss, ‘nough to go around
When I call her up watch she come
And I’m all above, that mean numb
What’s going on, the drugs, I need some
Then she glittered up, she seem cute
Man don’t worry ‘bout what we do
What we do is what we...fuck it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Bet she know my name, Remy Boyz the gang
All these bands on me, bitch, I came to play
I just popped a gram, I’m on rolling blades
Ho, don’t call my phone if you ain’t tryna play
Cause I swear to god, when I hit a thot, it’s over, it’s over
Fuck what your friends say, what they told ya, they told ya
Pulled up in that 4 door, that Rover, that Rover
ZooWap their favorite, it’s over, it’s over
I’m giving you this dick like I owe ya, I owe ya
Eating up that shit like leftovers, leftovers
Giving you this dick like I owe ya, I owe ya
Eating up that shit like leftovers, squad

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Montana Bucks]
You ain’t gotta ask, you know what my name is
I be talking cash, that’s my only language
I ain’t gotta brag, I get shit you can’t get
Bitches in the back, even the ones you came with
I be off the same shit, I be with your main bitch
Probly in the Range whip seeing how her brains get
I be off the same shit, I be with your main bitch
Probly in the Range whip seeing how her brains get

[Hook]
