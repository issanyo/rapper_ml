[Verse - Fetty Wap]
Shorty said she miss me, but she lie (but she lie)
Something 'bout me leaving made her cry (made her cry)
She don't want another nigga in her life (in her life, yeah)
I can't believe it yeah, I can't believe it no
Baby imma tell you what went wrong (what went wrong)
When I was sleeping, you was going through my phone (through my phone)
I was creeping yeah I couldn't leave her alone (leave her alone, yeah)
Even moved little shorty in my home (in my home, yeah)
And she played it cool and kept it smooth (kept it smooth, yeah)
Instagram the only way you knew (way you knew)
I ain't playing with you, I'm just being true, yeah
There's a million niggas doing what I do (what I do)
But a million niggas wouldn't tell the truth (tell the truth)
Kept it g but I guess it didn't work (didn't work, yeah)
Loyalty the only thing that hurt (thing that hurt, yeah)
I can't believe it yeah, I can't believe it no
