[Intro: Fetty Wap]
LoVel, Zoovier

[Verse 1: LoVel]
Speeding, all night
Faded, and that's alright
You're beautiful, beau-beau-beautiful
A broken record when I say it but shit, you should know
You should-you should be here, all night
Lookin' like that, all night
You're beautiful, oh you're beautiful
A broken record when I say it but
I don't care, if you don't care
It's all love
And if you're right here, and I'm right here
Then it's all us
So can you tell me

[Hook: LoVel]
Do you like your liquor light or dark
Do you wanna smoke, come hit this blunt
Tell me what you like, you need, you want
Tell me what to do, tell me what the move is
Tell me what the move is, tell me what the move is
Tell me what to do, tell me if it's you
Tell me what the move is

[Verse 2: LoVel]
Hennessy in my cup, right
Pour some more, p-pour some more
Keep showing me somethin', right
Cause you know I won't judge you
You should-you should be here, all night
Lookin' like that, all night
You're beautiful, oh you're beautiful
A broken record when I say it but
I don't care, if you don't care
It's all love
And if you're right here, and I'm right here
Then it's all us
So can you tell me

[Hook]
Do you like your liquor light or dark
Do you wanna smoke, come hit this blunt
Tell me what you like, you need, you want
Tell me what to do, tell me what the move is

[Bridge: LoVel]
Call us a cab, we need it
Tell me what you want, I mean it
You're coming home with me
You're coming home with me tonight
You're beautiful, beau-beau-beautiful
You're coming home with me tonight
A broken record when I say it but shit, you should know
You're coming home with me tonight

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
Lemme tell you that you beautiful
This is something you should know
For you I drop them bandz
Because I make them on the usual
She my Trap Queen, you know what trap mean
And when we trap the gang, we just do the trap thing
So tell me what the move is
Don't leave me out here clueless
For you, you know I'd lose it
Hope you don't play me loosely
Pull you out something pretty
That-that mothafuckin' roofless
Drivin' around the city
Girl tell me what the move is, baby
They watchin' how we do this, baby
Recording like a movie, baby
Excited rockin' Zoovier, baby
So won't you tell me what the move is, baby

[Hook]
