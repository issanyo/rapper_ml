Girl, you are killing it
Your body is banging and I am feeling it
The way I am feeling there’s no concealing it
You’re young, you’re fine, so magnificent
Go on girl, yeah just keep killing it
Your body like an orange and I am peeling it
The way I am feeling there’s no concealing it
And that’s why I, I, I am really feeling it so
