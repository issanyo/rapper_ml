[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Wildin' for the bands, boy I'm juggin'
Pullin' up my pants when I hit 'em
Watch me do my dance when I finish
Watch me touch down on a million
Wildin' for the bands, boy I'm juggin'
Pullin' up my pants when I hit 'em
Watch me do my dance when I finish
Boy I touch down on a million

Know you hear a swoosh
My niggas hoop like we some fuckin' ballers
Hop off in my coupe then shit gets loose now she's a fuckin' stalker
She blow up my phone, leave me alone, girl I don't wanna call you
Ball like I'm from Georgetown, boy I ball like I'm a fuckin' Hoya
Cook like I'm Jamaican, baby, shouts out to my fuckin' Rasta
Hundred K to do you and my niggas move that fuckin' shotta
They be callin' me ZooWap from the bando, sellin' dimes and 20s
Hella pills on 22nd, trappin' out like fuckin' zombie
[?] hit you with 10, I swear my nigga meant to do it
Remy Boyz my fuckin' squad and ain't no way my niggas losin'
[?] hit you with 10, I swear my nigga meant to do it
Remy Boyz my fuckin' squad and ain't no way my niggas losin'

Wildin' for the bands, boy I'm juggin'
Pullin' up my pants when I hit 'em
Watch me do my dance when I finish
Boy I touch down on a million

[Verse 2: P Dice]
Lotta bands in my hoodie, try to blend, with you wouldy
You my son, you my son, shake my hand, get a nougie
Bout to fuck the grands up, then I pull my pants up
Then I pull up like some Pull Ups, make your baby stand up
Say we broke, how you figure? 17, them my niggas
Heaven we [?] 17 in the scripture
Holy ice, my description, holy Christ, I got bitches
Only right, only right, only Dice, what I'm pickin'
Ain't a band, we be drummin', hate a man that be frontin'
[?], they some fans, they ain't nothin'
Ain't a band, we be drummin', hate a man that be frontin'
[?], they some fans, they ain't nothin'

[Verse 3: Montana Bucks]
Monty from the hood, watch me do my dance
Countin' all these bands, poppin' rubber bands
That's just a couple grand, that's just a couple grand
Jumpin' out of vans, bitch I'm the man
I used to ride Intrepid, now I'm ridin' foreigns
Coppin' 17, comin' out of millions
My nigga beat the charge, shout out to my lawyer
I hit my connect, yeah I just placed an order
Baby this is Zoo, who the fuck is you?
She work up at [?], she know what to do
I love the way she move, I might act a fool
Don't make me get the tool in here like boom-boom-boom

Watch me do my dance when I finish
Boy I touch down on a million
