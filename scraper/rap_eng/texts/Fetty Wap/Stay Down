[Chorus]
I'ma stay down, most these niggas know this
Life rebounds, gotta keep it focused
Top down when we rollin'
Tell me girl, is you rollin'?
I been checkin' you out, make me insane and
I'm digging your style, like how you ride it
And I swear you're a drug, get me the highest
Just a dose of your love and I go flying
I'ma stay down, most these niggas know this
Life rebounds, gotta keep it focused
Top down when we rollin'
Tell me girl, is you rollin'?
I been checkin' you out, make me insane and
I'm digging your style, like how you ride it
And I swear you're a drug, get me the highest
Just a dose of your love and I go flying

[Verse 1]
Like girl, let me put it on ya
Let me get it to the morning
Coming back, girl you know I be on ya
We could wake up a porn, you're gettin' it on yeah
Go straight to the moon, I swear you're a school baby
The things I would do, I'm giving it true baby
With the top down, cruising with the homies
Get under, you know where we looking
King Zoo, baby moving like an OG
Four K bring her back in her old jeans
Plus she got the bands and the slow creep
Honey in [?] and didn't know me
Yeah and money ain't gonna spend, gotta hold it
You should see my new car from my old chick
Got a brand new life from the old bitch
Pateks baby, and Rollies, yeah

[Chorus]
I'ma stay down, most these niggas know this
Life rebounds, gotta keep it focused
Top down when we rollin'
Tell me girl, is you rollin'?
I been checkin' you out, make me insane and
I'm digging your style, like how you ride it
And I swear you're a drug, get me the highest
Just a dose of your love and I go flying
I'ma stay down, most these niggas know this
Life rebounds, gotta keep it focused
Top down when we rollin'
Tell me girl, is you rollin'?
I been checkin' you out, make me insane and
I'm digging your style, like how you ride it
And I swear you're a drug, get me the highest
Just a dose of your love and I go flying
