[Hook: Montana Bucks]
She work over night, she work over night

(4x)

[Verse 1: Montana Bucks]
She work over night getting that money right
I know what you like, she ride like motor bikes
These niggas ain’t rolling right, these niggas ain’t glowing right
My niggas’ll take your life, she working late tonight
She up in Magic City, girl all that ass and titties
Or up in KODs, she tryna come stay with me
Work at the strip club, love how them lips look
She call, I pick up, then get my dick sucked
Uh, baby I’m with the squad, baby I’m living large
They know who we are buying out the bar
Bitch, I’m 17 a.k.a. ZooGang
In my Robin jeans, she my trap queen

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Her ass fat, I like the way it shake when it be wobbling
ZooWap throwing cash, baby you know my zoo weird
Right past moving fast, baby we switching ‘rari gears
Dime bags, we done graduated, we moving pounds in here
My bitch got a couple felonies, but I don’t fucking care
And we both rock Giuseppes being on a couple pair
Her ass fat, she rip the Robin jeans, you know her shit on fleek
Catch a bitch tryna talk to Wap, you know my bitch gon’ geek
Told her ass that she wasn’t mine, she was gon’ let Monty ski
Dinner time, you know my dinner fine, girl I can’t wait to eat
Winter time, you know it’s winter time, come to the zoo for heat
Winter time, you know it’s winter time, come to the zoo for heat
Squad

[Hook]
