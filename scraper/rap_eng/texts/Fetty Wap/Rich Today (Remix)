[Chorus: Kazzie]
Just called my bro and said "you wanna make some stacks today?"
Then hit the plug and said "I wanna meet right up today"
I thank the lord, cuz I've been praying for a better way
We gon' get rich today
We gon' get rich today
We gon' get rich today
We gon' get rich today
I called the plug and said "I'm on my way"
On my way

[Verse 1: Kazzie]
Call up the plug like "I'm ready"
He said he comin' in the Chevy
And I tell him "cool, same spot that you met me"
Make sure you park right in front of the getti
And shout out to Snootie
Salute to Montana
And my nigga Fetty
And you know the boy, put on for the city
We used to be light, now my nigga we heavy
I'm tryna make a dollar outta 15 cent
So every day, man, I hustle
I sat on that block till it bubble
My niggas don't trust you, the things that we do just to get out the struggle
Grandma still trippin' about all of the bricks that I hide in the kitchen, I'm always in trouble
Tell her "don't trip, man the day I get rich imma buy you a house", she said "baby, I love you"
Come from the mud
There's blood on that money
There's blood on them drugs
All of these niggas insistin they thugs
You can get hit with a pistol and slugs
Bro just called my phone, and he said "stoner lets hit this lick, this day"
Told my nigga I'm with it, man lets get it, we gon' get rich today

[Chorus: Kazzie]
Just called my bro and said "you wanna make some stacks today?"
Then hit the plug and said "I wanna meet right up today"
I thank the lord, cuz I've been praying for a better way

We gon' get rich today
We gon' get rich today
I hit the plug and text "I'm on my way"

Got it all on yayo

All them pussies, testin' work, take that bitch to Zaspies
I can't help it

Dis all I knew before the money, and the wealth
Up in the projects by my motherfuckin' self
Down in that work, I ain't need no motherfuckin' help
I can't help it
Call me selfish
All that mula, Imma make it
Like the devil, I will burn it
All that mula, I will take it
From my plug, I will take it
On my love, if you take it
Imma see you, meet yo maker
Count this money, got me crazy
On God

[Verse 4: Montana of 300]
Uhuuuuh
Aye, rap God, what he on
That bad boy, Puffy Combs
Yeah, I built this shit on my own
Trap house, home alone
Before the buzz, nigga
I was out here, drug dealin'
Before the rappin', I was trappin' since a young nigga
Playin' with bands, and bangin' 40's like a drum nigga
In God I trust Montana, used to be the plug nigga
See I grew up in a place
Where it ain't no such thing as safe
Ready to shoot with this big clip
I had shit boomin' like I'm Blake
Made Cash Money of that Drizzy
I ain't talkin' bout no Drake
I was on that interstate
Glove compartment full of cakes
Squad

Just called my bro and said "you wanna make some stacks today?"

We gon' get rich today
We gon' get rich today
We gon' get rich today
I called the plug and said "I'm on my way"
On my way
We gon' get rich today
We gon' get rich today
We gon' get rich today
I hit the plug and text "I'm on my way"
I'm on my way
