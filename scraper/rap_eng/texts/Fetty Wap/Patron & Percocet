I can change your life
I'll change the feel of your body
Lay this pill right on your tongue
Wait 'til it kick like karate
I'm miles and miles away
Hotels and late night shifts
I'm miles and miles away
Patron and Percocet

[Verse 1: M-80]
Go out on a late night
Tryna see what it taste like
Jump in the Lambo, hit the brake like
Pop a Perc, light an L hit my dab
Cause you wanna get close to me
Come hit the shows with me, threesomes with hoes with me
Cause I can be all you got
I am everything and more he's not
Cause I'm high and you're mine
So I'mma blow your mind baby

[Hook: M-80]
I can change your life
I'll change the feel of your body
Lay this pill right on your tongue
Wait 'til it kick like karate
I'm miles and miles away
Hotels and late night shifts
I'm miles and miles away

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
And you know how I like it baby
Take 2 pills, don't take too much
I beat it up in my Nikes baby
Hop on it man wish a nigga would
And I know that you like me baby
And please don't try to fight me baby
If I get jammed, gon' write me baby
There ain't no one like me baby
Miles and miles away
You know I smoke piles and piles a day
You know the Zoo are on the way
And you know RGF is where we stay, yeah baby
Are you scared of my bands, baby?
RGF, we gon' win baby
We the squad let us in baby
I need you and your friends baby
