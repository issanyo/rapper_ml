You see, our lives are not the same, baby
I chase the money not the fame, baby

You see, our lives are not the same, baby

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
I just copped the new Benzo
And you see them stacks
My bitch, she thought that was the ransom
And she can't ever let it go
She know I keep it on me
So God knows niggas got bankrolls, baby
And they watching how my chain glow
Trapped out the ZooGang
They gon' watch me do my thang tho, baby
Tryna skrrt, she know she ain't tho
Stay rollin' up, I stay rollin' up

Five thousand for some bracelets, baby

I'm all about the racks, yeah baby
And you know I'm 'bout to cash in, baby

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
You see, our lives are not the same, baby

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I fuck with the Vodka she fuck with the Rose
Strap in the Uber they searchin' the Rove
Came from the bottom, put work in the stove
I left out the bando, came back in the Rolls
Fuck all 'em problems, drinkin' the Hen out the bottle
Shawty's a model, she wanna do me
Chasin' 'em dollars, makin' a movie
How bout that ooh, my dawg on the news
Came from the bottom baby, how can I lose?
In front of the deli, hit up my celly for 2 for 5
Make me a milli, Vodka with Diddy
Hop in the coupe and slide, skurt

She don't know my name, nigga
Left her by the bando came back in the Lambo

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
