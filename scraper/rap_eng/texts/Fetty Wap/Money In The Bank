[Chorus]
Baby I got money in the bank, yeah
I could blow some money, what you think, yeah
I'ma put a four up in my drink, let's slide
I got different types of foreign cars outside
Baby I got money in the bank, yeah
I could blow some money, what you think, yeah
I'ma put a four up in my drink, let's slide
I got different types of foreign cars outside

Pull up in that shit and make your heart stop

Baby I got money in the bank, yeah

See my diamonds and you see 'em from afar, from afar
Zoovie Zoo, I'm something like a star, like a star
Zoovie, I got money, fuck you thought, fuck you thought?
I said baby take a look at my car
See my diamonds and you see 'em from afar, from afar
Zoovie Zoo, I'm something like a star, like a star

[Chorus]
Baby I got money in the bank, yeah

I'ma put a four up in my drink, let's slide
I got different types of foreign cars outside
Baby I got money in the bank, yeah
