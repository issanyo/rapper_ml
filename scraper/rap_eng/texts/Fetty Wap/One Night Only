[Chorus: Fetty Wap, Don Lu
Both ]
Put your hands in the air if you know what's up
I swear they know what's up
Pourin' champagne when we pull up
We roll up, make plenty noise
Be loud, make plenty noise
Backwoods are what we roll
Liquor and plenty hoes (Yeaaa baby)

[Verse 1: Don Lu]
Uhh, Baby throw your hands back
She said she wanna party, throw that ass back
She got a booty make a nigga wanna smash that
Cake, cake, cake, cake, damn that ass fat
Momma you poppin, so fuck the drama they talking
And all these niggas is bitches and tripping cause girl you got it
I swear to god you a goddess, you got an ass like Nicki
Plus you bad like Rihhana and got a swag like Iggy
Like really what can you gimme, for one night only
Fuck with me, yea the whole city know me
Out the town, I be the youngest OG
How it sound? I told her bust it for me
And she gon go low, she gon go low
I walked up in the building wearing polo
Jordan kicks keep me fresh, where the hoes tho?
Don't start talking about your ex that's a no no


[Chorus: Fetty Wap & *Don Lu* & **Both** ]

**Put your hands in the air if you know what's up**
**I swear they know what's up**
**Pourin' champagne when we pull up**
We roll up, make plenty noise
*Bring loud, make plenty noise*
*Backwoods are what we roll*
Liquor and **plenty hoes** (**Yeaaa baby**)


[Verse 2: Fetty Wap ]
Imma let her try me, try me
Imma pull up on her in a big body
I ain't been listening to everybody
Niggas got me sleep, sounding like a zombie
I'm spicing shit up, bitch I'm Teriyaki
Seventeen (Seventeen), that's the squad beside me
Imma jump states, cops will never find me
Run up on Wap, they won't find your body
I rap full time but your bitch my side piece
Right after I nut can you go outside please
I ain't got time for nobody
Bitch I got to win, got to get my Rari
Just got a black beamer, pull up at the party
I know these niggas scared, they trying to beg they part in
But I remember shit when it first started
Big Zoowap, man I'm balling


[Chorus: Fetty Wap & *Don Lu* & **Both** ]

**Put your hands in the air if you know what's up**
**I swear they know what's up**
**Pourin' champagne when we pull up**
We roll up, make plenty noise
*Bring loud, make plenty noise*
*Backwoods are what we roll*
Liquor and **plenty hoes** (**Yeaaa baby**)

[Verse 3: Don Lu]
I gotta call saying plans is gonna fall through
So my whole crew swagging when we walk through
Just got back from the mall, everything all new
I pop Ciroc at every party cause I want to
And some these niggas hate that I got guap too
Turn up, ain't no telling what that Ciroc do
And if I'm turnt girl you know imma call you
Come through baby Imma show you how a boss move
Fetty walks thru with J's on his feet
And I keep it fresh my belt saying Gucci
If it ain't that Gucci then it's saying LV
This game ain't too sweet, but I'm playing for keeps
Haaa, and you know we can't lose
Watch me get it , my team winning all we need is coupes
Watch me pull up with the squad yelling we the truth
Bitches look up like oh god his team really cute
See me move nigga


[Chorus: Fetty Wap & *Don Lu* & **Both** ]

**Put your hands in the air if you know what's up**
**I swear they know what's up**
**Pourin' champagne when we pull up**
We roll up, make plenty noise
*Bring loud, make plenty noise*
*Backwoods are what we roll*
Liquor and **plenty hoes** (**Yeaaa baby)
