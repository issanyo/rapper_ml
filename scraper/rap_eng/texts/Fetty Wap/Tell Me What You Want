[Verse 1: T-Wayne]
I told her come with me because I know she fire
Bought her ass a new car so she could be my rider
I had to take her to the crib just to be beside her
Them other girls be hatin' on, but they don't even try her
They so unnecessary, cause this is legendary, yeah
And I'm just tryna kick it like I'm Vinatieri
Do it all, yeah we gonna do it all, yeah
Let me see you throw it back like a booty call
Had to take her to the show just to make a movie
They was hatin' on me, flexin', actin like they knew me
I'm a soulja baby, make sure they salute
I just wanna let you know that you the truth

[Verse 2: Monty]
It's Monty and I'm on now
Smoking so I'm stoned now
She won't leave me alone now
Everytime I'm fallin' down
Lovin' when she goin' down
We ain't worry about them hoes now
All my weed is so loud
Hit the show it's so loud
Ridin' with the top down
Tell them haters calm down
100s in my palm now
17 on the charm now
And you know I'm in my zone
Just put your number in my phone
You see the diamonds in my chain
Remy Boyz and T-Wayne
