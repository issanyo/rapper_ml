[Bridge] (Fetty Wap)
Young nigga gotta move real wisely/
You know the devil come in different disguises/
Same way your day one niggas will despise you/
Try Fetty Wap a nigga one eye you/


[Hook] (Pimpton)
Aye, aye, I been movin zaps all day/
Fucked off like five-six packs and fingered two for foreplay/
My team like Marshawn Lynch, they run it back like andalé/
Now I'm in & out the country pushing toons like anime/


[Verse 1] (Pimpton)
I'm up like Eiffel, parler vous français?/
If so then swallow, and say enchanté/
If u ain't talkin pay, then me no comprendé/
But if u finna catch a bone, bitch you can call on me/
Boy genius, call me dexter in the laboratory/
Serve that shit so raw they slam it right there in the doorway/
Killa Ralph still on that bender, he ain't slept in four days/
N if he make a thousand every hour, that's a hundred k in four days/

[Verse 2] (Fetty Wap)
Aye, I’m stackin up all this cabbage, don’t let me catch you in traffic, aye/
Fuck around with my crew, lil nigga I’ll let you have it, aye/
Baby I’m from the zoo, you know my zips i bag em, aye/
Runnin up wit my loot, runnin up might go go blast him, aye/
You know I’m riding round in a Rari/
Got so many cars I got four apartments/
And I got three cars in each garage man/
And I’m buyin cars, it’s just my hobby, wow/

[Verse 3] (Pimpton)
Aye, my niggas committed, they whippin from heaven to hell and back/
You want it, just holla, the price can keep fallin, the larger the order no holdin back/
I don't need to know your life story, all I need is your name, and the turn over/
I'm up, might cop my bitch a bag, that fendi make her roll over/
Awn, I light one up and now im post sober/
I cash a cheque, then catch a flight, my money lay over/
Aye, and I might throw some racks at some strippers today/
Make a bitch shake her ass like her first cabaret/
If she earn it, I'll splurge it, my zaps go all day/
