[Verse 1: P-Dice]
Classy when they talk about, girl I love you fatty ass
Exactly what I’m talking ‘bout, chickens wish they had me
They ain’t down right, they got [?], trust me, baby, I could tell
Your face is the cutest and your outfit looking right as well
‘Member when I seent you, ‘member when I seent your ass
I was bumping “I Need You,” only ‘cause I need your ass
Fuck that snap, she diesel, grab the stick, it’s time to rock
She said “why you live so fast,” guess I’m just that kind of guy
Lately, we been laying up
I used to be afraid of her like “what am I gon say to her?”
What angle should I hit her from?
Hating how I’m with her dumb, haters got that bitter tongue
But, I don’t care, what they eat don’t make me shit
Pull up in that crazy whip, man, I swear she crazy thick
Ride to a secluded place, promise I’m gon screw her great
Promise I’m gon screw her great

[Hook]

She replied like “boy you think you’re funny”? I’m like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You just twerk and I’ma throw this money in the air, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you say you love me, let me pull up on your hair, yeah, yeah, yeah
I threw back the “e,” gave her L-O-V
Said she had a man so you know I intervened
And I ain’t got no plans, tryna get in between
