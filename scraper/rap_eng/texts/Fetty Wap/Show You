I ain't never gave a fuck about a nigga
So why the fuck I'ma start now?
All he know is going to stores and drug dealing
Gotta move the work 'fore they run down
Watch how I roll the wood, light the herb now
ZooGang run the world now

I got 50 thou on me right now
That nigga acting wild, calm his ass down
Fetty Wap a brand new sound

[Verse 2: Montana Bucks]
She head over heels, hustling hills, you know where I stay
I'm counting these bills, keeping it real, show you the way
These niggas is snakes, we getting this cake, Versace shades
It's me and you, what you wanna do, no time to waste
And I be thinking 'bout you when I'm far away
Got all these fucking Robins, I might fly away
That's 6 for a pair, you know how I play
Back to back in Beamers, ain't shit changed
Came from the hood to Hollywood
Now everywhere we go everybody look
Oh, we was down but we got it up
Getting money but that ain't enough
Keep them Robin jeans on me
Keep a couple G's on me
All this damn weed on me
I pull up, everything's on me
ZooGang, 1738
ZooWap, Monty, Remy Boyz, squad!
