Anywhere you want, I can take you there, I swear baby
Anything you need, I can get for you, be clear baby
Girl you are my drug, how I fiend for you, beware baby
Ay, yeahh baby

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
I said, all I want for Christmas
Hold up, let's check my wishlist
Giving you something different
I'm where they say he isn't
You're mine, you know he isn't
And I play my position
I'm Jordan and peeps is Pippen
I'm warmed up, let's have a scrimmage
Most valuable player in it
I'ma show you how to shine on them baby, ay
Keep going, don't waste no time on 'em baby, ay
Girl you shine brighter than a diamond, I swear
And if you like it, it can be Christmas all year
Said you shine brighter than a diamond, I swear
And if you like it, it can be Christmas all year
17, you know the squad with me baby, ay
Take care of you, that's just a job for me baby, ay

[Verse 2: Monty]
(Monty) What you want for Christmas?
I handle my business
Zoovie got like ten whips
It was 4th and inches
The way we blowing money like a motherfucker been rich
Chilling where it's sunny and my honey got the French tips
Lighten up this Christmas tree
Baby, come and get with me
Take a trip to Tiffany
Late night, you be missing me
All red, like I'm Santa Claus
You can see your man tomorrow
I am not no imature
Pull up in them fancy cars
Everyday a holiday
Balling like I'm Hardaway
Monty Zoo, you know I'm paid
Rolling like some roller blades
Hit me, I come right away
Smoking by the fireplace
And I'm young and gifted
I want you for Christmas

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
