And I know that she love that I'm icy
And I got bands and I know that you like me, yeah baby
Can't wait 'til they frame Mr. Perfect
Until then I'ma come through swervin'
You smokin' a zip, I stay off the shits
Is it the cars that I drive or the gang that I'm with?
A couple bands on the left, on the right's a clip
And I'm a smooth young nigga and I'm runnin' this shit
Look, I come through in the droptop Benz
So much money I could fuck your fan
My pockets stay heavy and my Glock stay ready
I keep a firearm, mothafucka I'm petty
Aye, me, Gritty and Mont
Gon' hate, pussy nigga, this is not what they want
Cause I'm Zoo Gang, I let the tool bang
I let her too, thangs, watch how we do things, 1738
