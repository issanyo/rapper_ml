[Intro: Montana Bucks]
Uhh, Montana, Fetty Cash
P-Dice, Remy Boyz, 1738

[Hook: Montana Bucks] [2x]
I met my connect up in Chipotle
Remy Boyz, back to back in Dolce
Gabbana, that's designer
Remy Boyz all about them commas

[Verse 1: Montana Bucks]
I met my connect up in Chipotle
Smoking on this dope, I let it rotate
I swear these niggas so fake
Got a bad bitch, she go both ways
She Madonna or Rihanna
And I even let her hit the ganja
I remember when she used to drive the Honda
Got a Spanish bitch, her name Yolanda
I let her suck my dick, I'm like ma√±ana
I pull up in that motherfucking Tonka
Your bitch looking at me like she want a sponsor
She pulling down my pants like you a monster, let's go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
I met my connect up in Chipotle
I re-up a hundred times every four days
Fuck the block, started trapping out the hallways
Bitch, I just want the top, fuck a foreplay
I'm with three bitches, you know I'm coming
I took these bitches to the carpet and we all fucking
And all these bitches jumps, I just connect the wires
And I just rolled the 32nd, cannot find my lighter
And I'll shoot your ass quick boy, I ain't tryna fight ya
And how you know she suck my dick and then go fucking wife her?
He said I never met the plug, it almost had me crying
He said I never sold a drug, it almost had me dying, squad!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: P-Dice]
I met my connect in Chipotle and I peace from being down
Bout the heffas and cocaine while we feasting, we in town
Puffing up on the marijuan, run up and get paralyzed
Selling hot and you're hearing it, you don't act like you hearing nah
Balling we made it it, man your last shit I hated it
You ain't lasting, that's common fact
We the best, let's remind them that
Treat your bitch to a [?] and she ask where the condom at
Treat your bitch to a [?] and she ask where the condom at
Nigga trust me I'm weeded as hell, so high that Jesus could tell
I cash any, pass me the weight, I'm out 'fore I finish my plate
Trust me I'm weeded as hell, so high that Jesus could tell
I cash any, pass me the weight, I'm out 'fore I finish my plate

[Hook]
