[Intro: Kwabs & Fetty Wap]
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Kwabs!
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Zoovier!
'Cause if I don't walk, then I get caught out
And I'll be falling all the way down
1738!

[Verse 1: Kwabs]
Hundred headlights making me blind
All of your pleasures catching my eye
If I jump once, then I never think twice
But your temptations making me stay another night
And my senses only lie to me, lie to me
I don't know how I feel so raw to me, raw to me
I gotta check myself before I get what I want
Find out it's not what I thought it was
And you know I

[Chorus: Kwabs]
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
'Cause if I don't walk, then I get caught out
And I'll be falling all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
'Cause if I don't walk, I keep messing around
And I'll be falling all the way down

[Verse 2: Kwabs]
Tell myself "Leave!", while I'm still strong
"Don't look back!", 'til I'm ten miles gone
And when the road stops, I'm gonna keep on
Until I end up in the place that I belong
But the pressure's pushing me back again
Telling me not to pretend
There isn't any use even trying to get you out my head
So I lift my feet off the ground
And I'm gonna walk right up

[Chorus: Kwabs]
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
'Cause if I don't walk, then I get caught out
And I'll be falling all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
'Cause if I don't walk, I keep messing around
And I'll be falling all the way down

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
It's time to turn it up
How I live my life, bottles with the lights
They know I'm comin', I'm right on the way
And I ain't got no type
I know you see me, baby come to my place
My gun be hella bright
Won't have to struggle, show you a new surrounding
I'm just living life
Girl I'm young, rich and famous
And don't know if I'm livin' it right
All I know is I came from nothing
Now everything I want I buy
All I know is I watch everything
And nothin' don't cross my eye
All I know is I love my gang
For Zoovier they gon' ride
Nit Da Grit say "I got you"
I've been handlin' for my side
Say I'm young, rich and famous
And don't know if I'm livin' it right
All I know is I watch everything
And nothin' don't cross my eye
All I know is I love my gang
For Zoovier they gon' ride

[Chorus: Kwabs]
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
'Cause if I don't walk, then I get caught out
And I'll be falling all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
'Cause if I don't walk, I keep messing around
And I'll be falling all the way down

[Outro: Kwabs & Fetty Wap]
I'm gonna walk now
I'm gonna walk now
Yeah, no, no, no
Better walk
1738!
Yeah, yeah â€“ no, no, no, no, no, yeah
Kwabs! Zoovier! Zoo Gang! Squaaaaa!
