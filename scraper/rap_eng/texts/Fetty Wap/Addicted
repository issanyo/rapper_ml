I got my check up and then I got me a bad bitch
Put all this ice up on my wrist, check out my karats
Ayy, I remember I had a little, now I got a lot
Ayy, keep that money comin' fast was the major plot
And I done turned blowin' money to a habit
And all these fuck niggas hatin' cause I'm mad rich
Ayy, addicted to makin' money, I could never stop
Ayy, Fetty Wap from the Zoo with PnB Rock

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
They know me from hits and
My hood be the shits and
I'm flickin' out the wrist and
Zoovie's flow is sick and
I think I need a doctor
Two pills and some broccoli
Name a hoe who stoppin' me
I'm icey like a hockey rink
My music sold a lotta units
Member when they doubted me
Now they see I'm gettin' to it
Everybody watchin' me
Zoovie got a gift for music
Sit back watch how Zoovie do it
You gon' take this ride with me
Come here lil' mama, get high with me
Is you tryna touch the sky with me
Understand that you gon' lie for me
I got bandz that's why they eyein' me
Please girl, don't you lie to me
I ain't what they try to be
It's Zoovie, I'm with PnB
Rookie in this shit
I swear to god these boys ain't seein' me

[Verse 2: PnB Rock]
Came up, straight up out the mud
I remember I was bustin' juggs
Last year I was sellin' drugs
This whole time I was on the run
Takin' trips back and forth, OT
Sleepin' and runnin' with my OG
Bustin' traps tryna be lowkey
Won't serve him if I think he police
Woke up this morning like "I gotta get it"
Only thing my niggas worried bout is snitches
Chasin' this money ain't worried bout bitches
We be in the kitchen, yeah we be remixin'
Wh-whippin' it, whippin' it straight out the bowl now
I'm flippin' it, servin' 'em O'z now
That glizzy it come with a pole now
Posted on traps, see where that shit go down
Fuck it if it ain't about my niggas
My gang I'ma always ride with 'em
Your homie told all five niggas
Still hangin' with 'em, you should die with 'em
New ice, new life, new lane
Bitch you know it's PnB and ZooGang
New ice, new life, new lane
Bitch you know it's PnB and ZooGang
