[Intro: Fetty Wap]
Ay, yeaaaaah baby
Squad! Ay

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Your girl hit me up on my two-way
Said she tryna turn up on a Tuesday
Tryna turn it up, roll the doobie
Bitch, I only smoke woods; roll the doolie
Girl hit me up on my two-way
Said she tryna turn up on a Tuesday
Tryna turn it up and roll the doobie
Bitch, I only smoke woods; roll the doolie

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
I do this for my city
I do this for my whole clout
It’s like everybody’s hittas
Nobody’s getting cash now
Where the fuck is all your bands?
What if police have it written down?
And I’ma keep it fucking g’
With all these kids that’s getting killed now
I pray that God protect my son
Fore I get up off my shit now
You niggas try and touch the twins
I swear I’ll roll out, get you killed now
This shit is like a movieeee
That’s why they call me Zoovieeer
I’m with your bitch usuallyyyy
I swear to God she blew meeeee
About a week ago

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Montana Bucks]
Said she wanna fuck
I told her hit me on a week day
Girl, you ain’t gotta rush
Take your time; take it easy
Metro Boomin’ want some more
But, baby this ain’t prepaid
Got some hoes out in PA
They only hit me on the three-way
And baby only Tuesday
She don’t care what them dudes say
She sweeter than some Kool-Aid chilling in my new shades
Turning up for today
I’m just tryna see what that’s like
Maybe, hit it from the back side
Cause I heard it get wet
Remy Boyz, we up next

[Hook]

[Verse 3: P-Dice]
I tell you we be too lit; I tell you we be too lit
We turning up, we higher; girl, we out here getting foolish
You bad and that’s no lie girl; no way I could refuse it
Yeah, I’m gon light your fire; girl, just tell me where the fuse is
Shining ho like this, lot of diamonds, yo I glist
I been turning up so much, I fucked around and pulled my wrist
Shining ho like this, lot of diamonds, yo I glist
I been turning up so much, I fucked around and pulled my wrist
Hit my two-way on a Tuesday; girl, I’m too paid
Fuck what you say, said she choosy cause she choose me
Can I see you? She like hell yeah, come the hell here
Eating seafood out in Bel-Air sipping Belaire

[Outro: Fetty Wap]
