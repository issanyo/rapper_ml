[Intro: Fetty Wap (Female Voice)]
Hello?
(Hello)
What’s up with you
(Nothing, what you up to?)
Shit I’m on the stove
(What you about to do?)
Shoot, I wanted to let you hear something real quick

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Whatever is mine is yours
Everything that you need I provide and more
It’s just something about you, I can not ignore
Everything that you do
I swear I adore
When you were looking my way
Seent the look on your face
I walked up and said hey
Now look where we stand today
Girl I just want to be yours
Aye, yeah, baby, aye
Squad, 17
Whatever is mine is yours
Everything that you need I provide and more
It’s just something about you, I can not ignore
Everything that you do (ZooWap)
I swear I adore
When you were looking my way

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
When you feeling down gotta get you high
We gonna spend them bands, I’mma get you fly
She my Trap Queen, with her whipping pies
Stay high, see you sexier in my eyes
Where you tryna go though?
That nigga he’s a dummy, he’s a dodo
I swear to God I’ll never let you go though
And anywhere you wanting, we can go though
Uh, for you a nigga switch it up
Trade the coupe for a range, that’s the family truck
Look, riding ‘round with my shorty with the blinking cut
And she gonna let it go, try to stick me up
I’m like everything we want, make the ground shake
Aye baby got back, that’s a pound cake
Whole squad on the grind like a skateboard
That’s why everywhere we go, niggas make noise
I’m like Silver Surfer baby, you can see me swimming
Batman Benz, that’s how I be dipping
Orange Lamb, that’s what I just rented
Big Benz Wap, my squad winning

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Whatever is mine is yours
Everything that you need I provide and more
It’s just something about you, I can not ignore
Everything that you do
I swear I adore
When you were looking my way
Seent the look on your face
I walked up and said hey
Now look where we stand today
Girl I just want to be yours
Aye, yeah baby, aye
Squad, 17

[Verse 2: Monty]
Monty, 1738
Beautiful, yes you are
In my eyes you’re a star
Big house, fancy cars
Yeah it’s yours, yeah it’s yours baby
Press record baby
Seen you before
Wonder what you got in store baby
And I already know what you’re thinking
And we ain’t gotta tell nobody, I can keep a secret
You can have whatever baby, keep it
Two hundred on the dash, taking bags out of Neiman's
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Cause if we gotta do it, we gotta do it big
She buy me a pistol, I buy her a purse
And everywhere we go, we get the His and Hers

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Whatever is mine is yours
Everything that you need I provide and more
It’s just something about you, I can not ignore
Everything that you do
I swear I adore
When you were looking my way
Seent the look on your face
I walked up and said hey
Now look where we stand today
Girl I just want to be yours
Aye, yeah baby, aye
Squad, 17
