Chasing paper, even when I'm on the lean I'm never lazy
A pussy nigga play, I'll send his ass straight to (?)
Keep the Glock beside me like (?) these niggas out here shady
Mob got me flexing, Wap turned me up a notch
Everyday different out, different city, different thots
Sex filled shawty, Glock 40 in the party
Everyday I pop a tab, drink a (?), serving bad
Pull up fast, they go fast, in and out, one stop shop
Take my bitch to shop, got it off the block, play with Wap
Get your top popped
Living lavish in expensive fabrics

Flexing on the old me back in counting on fleek

Four Rollies and they iced out, got a shine on me
Zoo god, got my 30 cars, it ain't no (?)

Extended clips get extended, his is like a lottery
Shorty says she tryna to learn the way I whip that pottery
I love it when she get nasty and make it slobbery

Make sure you niggas come correct, you tryna rock with me
A lot of niggas screaming Zoo Gang and they gon' rob for free
