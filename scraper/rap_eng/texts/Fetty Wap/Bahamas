[Hook: Monty]
That's my lil mama, that's my lil mama
She get it from her mama, get it from her mama
She hotter than the summer, hotter than the summer
And she get plenty commas, she get plenty commas
I finesse the strip and make an easy come up
Tens, twenties, fifties, turn them into hundreds
You get it how you want it, get it how you want it
Smoking on the finest, she from the Bahamas

[Verse 1: Monty]
She be getting commas and she with the drama
Only rock designer, she look like Rihanna
I might hit Miami, I might get some Robins
She only wanna sex me â€˜cause a nigga poppin'
Riding on a jet ski out in the Bahamas
And we can get to flexing whenever we wanna
She stepping in Giuseppe, some Dolce and Gabbana
If you disrespect then you'll be with piranhas
Bitch I'm seventeen, you know where to find us
Came up from the bottom, came up from the bottom
That's my lil mama, that's my lil mama
And she get plenty commas, she get plenty commas

[Hook: Monty]
That's my lil mama, that's my lil mama
She get it from her mama, get it from her mama
She hotter than the summer, hotter than the summer
And she get plenty commas, she get plenty commas
I finesse the strip and make an easy come up
Tens, twenties, fifties, turn them into hundreds
You get it how you want it, get it how you want it
Smoking on the finest, she from the Bahamas

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Baby girl so damn fine, baby won't you be mine?
Baby, baby, I love your style, baby I love your smile
Watch how I turn you on, watch how I beat it down, ay
Knowing that Zoo around, look at my engine loud, ay
He can get hit right now, nothing but goons around, ay
One of my Zoo hoes, [?] showing love, ay
Nigga I'm in the clouds, high as fuck right now, ay
Zoovier and [?] but [?]

Pump fake then I alley-oop, baby, ay
Hit my phone, show up in that club baby, ay
Zoo Gang's really on the true baby, yeah
Squad

[Hook: Monty]
That's my lil mama, that's my lil mama
She get it from her mama, get it from her mama
She hotter than the summer, hotter than the summer
And she get plenty commas, she get plenty commas
I finesse the strip and make an easy come up
Tens, twenties, fifties, turn them into hundreds
You get it how you want it, get it how you want it
Smoking on the finest, she from the Bahamas
