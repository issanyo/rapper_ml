[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
(Ms Rose. Ms Remy)
Cash rules everything around me, CREAM
I got old money, I'm gettin' new money
I just walked out, I'm runnin' through money
You see, he be giving me all this green money
I guess I did a good job when I blew money
I don't discriminate, I don't care who money
Never did subliminals, I'm talkin' bout you money
You think you hot cause he spent thousand of bills on it
I got that box, make him wait 6 years on it
Yeah it's that good, the girl so cold
I'm Queen Elsa baby, everything all froze
He call it ice cream, he gon' need a whole bowl
You eat all your hot fudge, I might lick your snow cone

[Bridge: Audrey Rose]
I made you believe it, you're so in your feelings
You claim that you need it, I'ma make you wait for it
If I give it to you, you better deliver
Just stick to the scripture, are you ready boy?

[Hook: Audrey Rose]
I've got that ice cream that you crave for
Are you really ready for what I've got
I've got that ice cream that you want boy
Oh baby I put you on
So come and get a taste of this, come and get a taste of this
Come and get a taste of this, ice cream, ice cream

[Verse 2: Audrey Rose]
It feels so much better, your lips make it wetter
Taste all of his pleasure, ohh
Just what you've been craving, it feels so amazing
Intoxicating, are you ready boy?
Just give you a taste, wanna leave you things out
So you'll always stay hungry, baby waiting for me
Not gonna just give it up, but I'll let you lick it up
If you be a good boy for me
If you want it real bad, then you'll have to prove it
I don't give it to anybody
Make my body go numb, all over your taste buds
You can have it now

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
You know I like ice cream, so tell me what your flavor is
Better yet, can I find out by myself?
Me and you, don't invite nobody else
We scream for ice cream and damn she melts baby
And I love the way you drip baby
And my hands around your hips baby
For the ice cream I'll drop them bandz
All hundreds to watch you dance
I watch you like a movie
You heard about the boy, they call me Zoovie
On everything, she got me actin' foolish
Eating her ice cream, goin' stupid
Yeah baby

[Hook]
