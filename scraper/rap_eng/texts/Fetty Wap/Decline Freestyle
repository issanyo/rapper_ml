[Intro]
Ayy
Oooooohhh
Ayy, this my shit man
Yeah, baby, ayy, ayy

[Verse]
Stop callin' me, declining her call
And when she callin' me don't answer at all
And if I answer it I'm cuttin' her off
Tryna hang with me, that bitch tryna be my boss
Tryna bang with me, don't know my gang at all
If you ain't singin' with me, them niggas like "oh my God"
Bitch you ain't sang to me, get kicked right out my car
They know I came with G's, broke niggas think they gon' rob
They know ZooGang with me
Turn off all these cameras please
Step up if you gon' bang at me
Just know I keep that thang on me
These guns extended magazines
Just tell 'em why you mad at me
You broke boy that's a tragedy
No wonder why they aggravated
Tryna come up, comin' after me, I swear that shit won't work
Get you done up, runnin' after G's, I swear this one gon' hurt
Move too slow, boy you can't box with me
I swear he popped a perc
You can tell you really envy me, I know his feeling's hurt
Ayy but baby I'm a grown man, I eat out my own hand
My niggas was hungry, I gave 'em they own pad
I pop up like "oh shit", then give 'em the whole clip
Find out who is so worth it, but man she on some ho shit
ZooGang niggas here baby, ayy
And ZooGang all I hear lately, ayy
Let the two bang if he did hear plenty, ayy
And please don't let 'em near me
I swear these niggas scary
Yeah baby!

[Outro]
Ayy, yeah

With the Glo, we get dough
