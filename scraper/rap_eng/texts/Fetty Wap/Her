Seventeen...

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
She like who is me, I'm like who is her
I rock Louis V, she rock Tory Burch and
I know what you need, I watch shawty twerk and
I ain't tryna cheat, we could get to swerving
She like who is me, I'm like who is her
I rock Louis V, she rock Tory Burch and
I know what you need, I watch shawty twerk and
I ain't tryna cheat, we could get to swerving

[Verse 1: Monty]
You know I put that work in, catch you then its curtains
Got me in a whirlwind, lately where your girls been
Yeah I heard you're bad so I had to see in person
Might get you a bag, spend some G's on a Birkin
Don't worry bout the tag, it's on me you deserve it
You know I got that cash, seventeen yeah you heard it
See you in my dreams, sexing in the sheets
Flexing in the streets, no I don't wanna leave
She like who is me, I'm like who is she
She got all them curves, I'm like who is her
She like who is me, I'm like who is she
She got all them curves, I'm like who is her

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
She like who is me, I'm like who is her
I rock Louis V, she rock Tory Burch and
I know what you need, I watch shawty twerk and
I ain't tryna cheat, we could get to swerving
She like who is me, I'm like who is her
I rock Louis V, she rock Tory Burch and
I know what you need, I watch shawty twerk and
I ain't tryna cheat, we could get to swerving

[Verse 2: Monty]
I beat it like I'm post to, eat it like its soul food
Baby girl you're so cool, I just want to know you
Take you round the world we ain't got to keep it local
Hit me we can swerve I ain't worried what them hoes do
I just need a chance I'm the man let me show you
Smoking on this loud talking bout what you gone do
I just want it now going down shawty so cute
I ain't no beginner just remember what I told you
From the bed to the floor, give me head in the car
Start the biting on your lips, I'm start fighting other chicks
From the bed to the floor, give me head in the car
Start the biting on your lips, I'm start fighting other chicks

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
She like who is me, I'm like who is her
I rock Louis V, she rock Tory Burch and
I know what you need, I watch shawty twerk and
I ain't tryna cheat, we could get to swerving
She like who is me, I'm like who is her
I rock Louis V, she rock Tory Burch and
I know what you need, I watch shawty twerk and
I ain't tryna cheat, we could get to swerving
