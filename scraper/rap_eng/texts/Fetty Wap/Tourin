{Hook: Khaos}
We came from nothin' now we tourin'
D. Wade carry over ballin' now we scorin'
Get that foreign, now it's time to get excited
Juggin rappin, he little mad that we need that profit
We came from nothin' now we tourin'
D. Wade carry over ballin' now we scorin'
Get that foreign, now it's time to get excited
Juggin rappin, he little mad that we need that profit

{Verse 1: Khaos}
Came from nothin, got it lost, we started juggin
All that money turned me arrogant, met some bad friends
Found my first love, imma love her till the end
Couple Maserati, hittin' donuts, watch me spin
Mobbin' with the ZooGang, poppin' to the end
Niggas think we fearless, but we just be giddy
Gettin Mains, take some Ls, we will make you listen
Gettin Mains, take some Ls, we will make you listen

{Hook: Khaos}
We came from nothin' now we tourin'
D. Wade carry over ballin' now we scorin'
Get that foreign, now it's time to get excited
Juggin rappin, he little mad that we need that profit
We came from nothin' now we tourin'
D. Wade carry over ballin' now we scorin'
Get that foreign, now it's time to get excited
Juggin rappin, he little mad that we need that profit

{Verse 2: StackzOut}
Runnin' through them checks, nothin boring
Only things high ride, is foreign
All my other hoes, all foreign
Foreign at the front, skirt, now we tourin'
17 pour it up with the 30
Fuck around I'll hit you with that .30
You ain't ever seen that bread, I ain't worried
You ain't ever seen that bread, I ain't worried

{Hook: Khaos}
We came from nothin' now we tourin'
D. Wade carry over ballin' now we scorin'
Get that foreign, now it's time to get excited
Juggin rappin, he little mad that we need that profit
We came from nothin' now we tourin'
D. Wade carry over ballin' now we scorin'
Get that foreign, now it's time to get excited
Juggin rappin, he little mad that we need that profit

{Verse 3: Fetty Wap}
Ay, Number 1 iTunes, I get that fuckin'
Check
My nigga StackzOut, don't play no disrespect
My nigga Khaos will bring it to your neck
It's ZooGang or nothin', bitch that's what I rep
1738, bitch I'm scorin' nigga
I might pull up in a motherfuckin' Ford nigga
And I just bought my bitch a new Benz
And I just bought my mother a new Beamer truck
BGK and Stackz, out ridin' till the end
No new niggas, don't believe in friends
If you run up, I hit you with the fan
I love my .40, but I keep it ebony
They call me Zoovier, bitch they know I'm fuckin' runnin'
You run up on the Zoo, you know my niggas gunnin'
Khaos and Stackz out ridin' till the end
ZooGang, 17, baby that's the camp
Wow!

{Outro: Fetty Wap}
The fuck these niggas thought, man they call me fuckin Zoovier nigga
Khaos Stackz album it's the motherfuckin' best, check the motherfuckin' stats, get the motherfuckin' racks
ZooWap
