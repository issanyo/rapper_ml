Esteban, I'm from sparrow
More jays than straight and narrow
And I get love from the bloods on Carol
Free Rico, all these blickies, no cheat codes
The way my block pumpin' is like we givin' free perico
Goons in the streets though, shootin' like a free throw
With his main twist, we don't date but she deep throat
Remember back then you ain't wanna know me now?
Now the tables' turned, I'm the big homie now
I'm from Jersey, we move work in the hurry
With the most beautifulest thing, Keith Murray
Lady in the streets though, freak in the sheets, woah
Fuck them other DJs, Moody on the beat ho
[?] run the streets though, papi's in my circle
[?] but we deep though, get the mix from people
Came a long way from sellin' packs on the curb
Oskama Esteban, I'm a legend in New Jersey
