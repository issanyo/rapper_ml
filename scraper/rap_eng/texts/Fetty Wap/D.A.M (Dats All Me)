[Hook]
You are so damn fine
I'm so damn glad you're mine
And you stay on my mind
I think about you all the damn time
You are so damn fine
I'm so damn glad you're mine
And you stay on my mind
I think about you all the damn time

[Verse 1]
I have some problems and I think that you could help me
It's been a while since a nigga had some action
I'mma rock your boat, just let me be the captain
I just have a question, listen to what I'm asking
Baby let me take you out, would you like it if I kissed you now?
Ain't tryna force you so let me know if it's workin'
I'mma take you down, swimming in your ocean
Can you feel me when I'm penetrating
You are now in tune, this is Fetty's station
Give it to me now, I'm so tired of waiting
I been hella patient, losing all my patience
Give it to me now, I'm so tired of waiting, yeah

[Bridge]
Ayy, and you are so damn fine
Love her slowly, hit it once then rewind
Ayy, and you are so damn fine
Love her slowly, hit it once then rewind

You are so damn fine

You are so damn fine

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Okay she bad and she know it
And she don't ever ask for bread, cause she know I'mma throw it
Ain't gotta ask her if its wet, cause I know its the ocean
And right after we sex, I don't leave I just hold her
I don't leave I just hold her
I treat my girl like a Queen, she gets whatever she needs
And when I tell her I'm hungry she says "Boy get on your knees"
Go to work, girl I feast, take me away from the streets
Cause she got just what I need, she my drug, I'm a fiend, yeah
I even see her up in my dreams, yeah
Counting money while you rolling my weed
And all I ask is her loyalty, yeah
And she can get whatever she want from me, yeah

[Hook]
You are so damn fine
I'm so damn glad you're mine
And you stay on my mind
I think about you all the damn time

You are so damn fine
I'm so damn glad you're mine
And you stay on my mind
I think about you all the damn time

You are so damn fine
I'm so damn glad you're mine
And you stay on my mind
I think about you all the damn time
Oh hey...
