[Intro: Fetty Wap]
Aye, 1738! Zoovier!
Aye, Aye

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Aye
Grandma said her grandson crazy, aye
She said, "Please pull your pants up, baby," aye
I told her, "Bands make my pants sag crazy," aye
She said, "I don't know what bands is, baby," aye
That's just money, grandma, that's just money, aye
That's just money, grandma, that's just money, aye
Told her, "Bands make my pants sag crazy," aye
She said, "I don't know what bands is, baby," aye

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Aye, all this money that I'm countin', yeah I'm carryin'
18,000K I spend a day, I could embarrass her
Aye his bitch for years just made it clear she wouldn't marry him
Aye I fucked her once then disappeared, that shit hilarious
Aye, I'm the Zoo, bitch, you are you, I don't do marriages
Aye, look, both of my kin's rich, I don't push carriages
Aye, and I just say the word, they send them packages
Aye, I send up the cash and then I'm wrappin' them
Aye, look, I live in the Zoo and I stay strapped with them
Aye, you hang with the goons and you get whacked with them
Aye, bitch, I live in the Zoo, stay and I'm paid with them
Aye, bitch, you stay with the goons and you get wrapped with them

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Aye
Grandma said her grandson crazy, aye
She said, "Please pull your pants up, baby," aye
I told her, "Bands make my pants sag crazy," aye
She said, "I don't know what bands is, baby," aye
That's just money, grandma, that's just money, aye
That's just money, grandma, that's just money, aye
Told her, "Bands make my pants sag crazy," aye
She said, "I don't know what bands is, baby," aye

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Hey!
Hop inside that motherfuckin' party drippin' sauce
I'm a real slimeball, I want a snake right on my coffin
Bitch, I'm boolin' like a fat bitch, diamonds wet, need dolphins
I'm a real nigga, feds came, I didn't do no talkin'
My lil brother got a bitch, and she trickin', yes indeed
Slime they ass out, we don't give 'em no lead
He live like a rat, he better hide from me
We pull up with sticks, we shootin' out the team
I got green on me, I ain't talkin' peas
Hey!
Swear like Mike Tyson, came up out my teeth
I gotta go get it by any means
I dun cut down on that lean
I got attached to that Henn
I feed my bitches the gin
Pull up in Bentleys with foreign new friends
I don't got no needle, I don't want no pen
Give her that wood, Glenn
Fuck nigga, don't act like we kin
I want the bean

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Aye

That's just money, grandma, that's just money, aye
Told her, "Bands make my pants sag crazy," aye
She said, "I don't know what bands is, baby," aye
