[Hook: Monty]
Countin' up, like ain't shit to do
Look at my ice, look at my jewels
I'm bustin' juugs, I stick and move
And do my dance, like Victor Cruz
I'm countin' up, like ain't shit to do
Look at my ice, look at my jewels
I'm bustin' juugs, I stick and move
And do my dance, like Victor Cruz

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Ayy, they know that we the shit, cause if we wasn't, wouldn't mention us
I only fuck with niggas headed down, was in the trench with us
You know they love the tools, run up the crowd, the bitches venture us
Hundred thousand feel like 20 dollars, he can't spend with us
It's RGF, yeah RGF the island, bitch remember us
Try to take the Zoovie chain, he must be smokin' angel dust
Niggas poppin' out the woodwork to get you angled up
Tangled up, fuck nigga you could never hang with us
I'm really with the bullshit, drive bys in Wranglers
Bitch give me good head, leave my balls danglin'
Don't compare the Zoovie to these niggas, wasn't trained with them
Verified in my hood, I was in the rain with them
Woop woop! See 'em comin', I ran from the train with them
Now they know that Zoovie rich, I got nothin' to prove to them
If I let a nigga take me out then that's a Jew to them
Zoo Gang, RGF, look what the Zoovie do to them, wow

[Hook: Monty]
Countin' up, like ain't shit to do
Look at my ice, look at my jewels
I'm bustin' juugs, I stick and move
And do my dance, like Victor Cruz
I'm countin' up, like ain't shit to do
Look at my ice, look at my jewels
I'm bustin' juugs, I stick and move
And do my dance, like Victor Cruz

[Verse 2: Monty]
I stick and move, pick and choose
Fuck her when I'm in the mood
Juice just parked the 'Rari in the mothafuckin' livin' room
This ain't what they want, just so you know
We had to give it to 'em
Monty's on, countin' up
All my niggas gettin' to it
It's me and Zoo-ie icy now
Tell them how they like me now
She gon' have to wipe me down
Bitch look like a hottie now
Get it, get it, do your dance
Ride around, a hundred Benz
I don't think they understand
Used to have to move them grams
Remy Boyz, I represent
We move like the president
Sippin' on that medicine
I'll go where you've never been
Remy Boyz, I represent
We move like the president
Sippin' on that medicine
I'll go where you've never been, squad!

[Hook: Monty]
Countin' up, like ain't shit to do
Look at my ice, look at my jewels
I'm bustin' juugs, I stick and move
And do my dance, like Victor Cruz
I'm countin' up, like ain't shit to do
Look at my ice, look at my jewels
I'm bustin' juugs, I stick and move
And do my dance, like Victor Cruz

[Outro: Monty]
Like Victor Cruz
Do my dance
Like Victor Cruz
