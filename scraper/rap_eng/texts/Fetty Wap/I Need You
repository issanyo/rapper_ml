[Intro: P-Dice]
Going day to day at it
Ballgame how I play at it
I'm gon' swing away at it
Girl let's go, want you so
[x4]

[Hook: P-Dice]
I don't know everything but I know I need you
Mesmerized like every time I see your ass
I just hope you wearing something see-thru
Boyfriend run up on me and I steal your ass
I need you, I need you [x4]

[Verse 1: P-Dice]
I'm diggin' your appearance, like the way you put together
Always got me staring, your man a lame, you could do better
Right bout now I'm faded, no I don't know you too well
So I hope we not related, cuter than my Louis belt
I ain't lying this is all true, settling for less girl
I ain't trying to insult you, come fuck with a fat girl
I could show you what it be like
Show you how it's supposed to be
Make sure you stay close to me
Right here where you supposed to be, I need you
Even though I roll the streets, I need you
Cut the shit girl, obviously I need you
Anyone with eyes can see I need you
Tell me you need me too
I really need to hear it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Monty]
I don't know everything
But I know I like the way that ass sit in them jeans
Baby they should put you in the fuckin' magazines
Them other bitches hating, it's not what it seems
You know what I mean, girl I need you
I won't tell nobody else what we do
Think about you every time I see you
I ain't playing no games, I'm tryna keep you
Tryna keep you, cause you got that good shit
I ain't tryna bullshit, girl I want you right now
I ain't tryna push it, you could turn the lights down
I be on that hood shit, I could get you iced out
Wish a nigga would trip

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
I ain't tryna play, hear what I say, girl I need you
To show it's real I'll get down on my knees too
My other half, she holding cash, rolling weed too
Her hair long and my top down when we breeze through
Girl I need you, girl I need ya
Girl I need you, whoa yeah
Girl, girl, girl, yeah

[Outro: P-Dice]
Going day to day at it
Ballgame how I play at it
I'm gon' swing away at it
Girl let's go, want you so
Going day to day at it
Ballgame how I play at it
I'm gon' swing away at it
Girl let's go...
