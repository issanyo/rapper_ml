[Chorus]
Do you like to get high?
Do you like to take trips by the water?
We can take off and ride
Let her brag about the shit that I bought her
How you feeling inside
Beautiful outside
Tired of living? Let's die
Here's your wings, let's fly

Do you like to get high?
Do you like to take trips by the water?
We can take off and ride
Let her brag about the shit that I bought her
Yeah, baby
