[Intro]
La musica de Harry Fraud

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
When you see me, I be pickin' up a bag, right, yeah
Just another reason I could brag, right
Yeah, ayy, you look like a bag lil' shawty (Shawty)
It ain't 'bout a bag, don't call me
When you see me, I be pickin' up a bag, right, yeah
Just another reason I could brag, right
Yeah, ayy, you look like a bag lil' shawty (Shawty)
It ain't 'bout a bag, don't call me

[Verse 1: Papoose]
I grew up on public assistance, my family poor
Now my money stacking, we slammin' them Caddy doors
If you tell me that I can't eat, to me that mean war
Niggas say they packing them ratchets, we carry more
If this was New Jack City, I'm Nino, you Al B. Sure
Pretty motherfucker, I never liked you, now carry on
Why you think all these haters wanna get at me for?
They mad 'cause they hear me makin' bangers with Harry Fraud
'Cause I be rippin' and runnin', tryna get rich as the Drummonds
I put the brick in the oven, while you be flippin' the onion
I get the zips in the dozens and turn them into the hundreds
You gotta witness the numbers, nigga them figures is stunnin'
I'm in the whip with my woman, we gripping, kissing and fuckin'
The cops tripping and dumbin', but I be ripping the summers
Them phoney niggas be running when real killers be coming
'Cause when the triggers be dumping, I dump a clip in your stomach

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
When you see me, I be pickin' up a bag, right, yeah
Just another reason I could brag, right
Yeah, ayy, you look like a bag lil' shawty (Shawty)
If it ain't 'bout a bag, don't call me
When you see me, I be pickin' up a bag, right, yeah
Just another reason I could brag, right
Yeah, ayy, you look like a bag lil' shawty (Shawty)
If it ain't 'bout a bag, don't call me

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
[?] zoovier, no fucking chains, right, yeah
Had to pull her skirt up and get up lanes, right, yeah
Had to get my money in the bank, right, yeah
Had to stay away from all these lames, right, yeah
I'ma put these niggas in their lane, yeah
RGF a family, not a gang, yeah
For RGF and Zoovier, let it bang, yeah
Diamond on my motherfucking chain, bling, yeah
Dump the fucking cookie 'fore we change like, yeah
I don't really play the in betweens like, yeah
Shooting out them, you know what I mean, yeah
Twenty seconds, serving all the fiends, yeah

Run and we really let it ring like, yeah
Way I'm living, I don't even dream like, yeah
But I'm living out my motherfucking dream like yeah

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
When you see me, I be pickin' up a bag, right, yeah
Just another reason I could brag, right
Yeah, ayy, you look like a bag lil' shawty (Shawty)
If it ain't 'bout a bag, don't call me
When you see me, I be pickin' up a bag, right, yeah
Just another reason I could brag, right
Yeah, ayy, you look like a bag lil' shawty (Shawty)
If it ain't 'bout a bag, don't call me
