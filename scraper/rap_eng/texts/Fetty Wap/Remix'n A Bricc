[Hook: Starrah]
Stovetop poppin', nigga, remixin' a brick (God damn)
Young nigga, workin', nigga, remixin' a brick (Whip it, whip it)
Wet it, cook it, chop it, nigga, remixin' a brick (
Bad bitch workin' while I'm remixin' a brick (Remix that shit!)
Stovetop poppin', nigga, remixin' a brick
Young nigga, workin', nigga, remixin' a brick (goddamn)
Wet it, cook it, chop it, nigga, remixin' a brick (how you work that?)
Bad bitch workin' while I'm remixin' a brick (remix that shit!)

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
And I just dropped the fuckin' ceilings on my verse
Chopped down, so used to remixin' the work
A bitch off of Mollies, I'm off Xannies, I'm off 30s
And my traphouse steady boomin' with my birdies
And that bitch it barely close and open early
And we up and shinin' bright just like my jewelry
And we screamin' fuck 12 and fuck the jury!
And my bitch keep callin' up my phone like what the hurry?
Ayy I told that bitch go start the car, just copped the 30
The plug just heard me talkin' juugs and now he nervous
Ayy, phone conversations got 'em worried
He say he callin' back around 11:30, squad!

[Verse 2: Bricc Baby]
I'm the king of finessin', I remix it, nigga, quick
Hit the nigga with the nanas, pray on accidental shit
Hope a nigga got a toilet, cause I know a nigga pissed
He said it don't look good, but he don't like it when I whip
I'm a monster with the shit, I'm a lobster, you a shrimp
Gang of choppers in this bitch, we get it poppin' in the 6
Dope's old when it fold, my mama taught me that shit
This bitch gon' keep callin' my phone, but I ain't givin' back shit
Hurricane with the wrist, Santa Claus dropped the bags on me
Got the percs and the Xans on me, skinny jeans with the bands on me
A thousand grams worth of cash on me, it's safe to say I got a bag on me
Stove poppin', I'm the man, homie, wrist drippin', put the swag on me

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Tap homie remix, him gon' remix him some bricks
Big dog in real life, yes I'm really with the shits
I can take you out and really show you some shit
Get it poppin', never stoppin' cause it's legit
Got sticky pockets for the bird
I'ma pour a 4 of syrup
I'ma do it like it work
I'ma buy the bitch a Birkin
I'ma make sure she good
Make sure she'll never worry
I'ma make sure she'll ball, ball, ball
Baby trust me, I'm worth it
Order up a round, tearin' down the town
Never out of bounds, shots, no pounds
Baby I could change your life and change every life that's around you
Baby stay down, don't make a sound
