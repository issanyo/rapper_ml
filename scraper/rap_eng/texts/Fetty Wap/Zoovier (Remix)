[Verse 1: NittDaGritt]
My name NittDaGritt, bitch I do not rap
I'm only known just for selling crack
Since 14, I been in the trap
My number 14, nigga that's a fact
I always knew to get it, no one ever told me
I always knew to stack it, no one ever showed me
I always been real, never been a phony
And I'd never ever let this money shit control me
Cause when you die, you can't take it witcha
Before I go, I gotta make some millions
They ain't witcha when you down, then them ain't your niggas
It's crystal clear how I paint the picture
We been down for too long, now it's time to blow up
Time to kick back relax, watch them numbers go up
1738, all the bitches know us
I tell all my hoes I love 'em, I don't care so what

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Ba-Ba-Ba-Bands all in my Robin jeans, niggas tryna rob me
Fuck nigga better duck ‘fore I get the tommy
Riding in the drop top with a mami
Hundred bands I’ma drop soon on my time piece
Bands all in my Robin jeans, niggas tryna rob me
Fuck nigga better duck ‘fore I get the tommy
Riding in the drop top with a mami
Hundred bands I’ma drop soon on my time piece
Tints all on my beamer boy, ZooWap I’m so special
Came up off of nothing, now it’s money in my dresser
Only jeans I rock got wings, five hundred just to dress her
Stupid loud in the woods, ZooWap roll it faster
Had to check my fucking six, I floor it, it go faster
ZooWap from the trap, I swear my sack is a disaster
Different color twelve, twelve skinnies in a plastic
You gon' need a fucking phantom if you tryna match it
Gritt and Dice on twenty-eight, trapping out the mansion
Old school days, bought Chevy for my grandma
All I wanna do is whip, put ZooWap on the landmark
Thru these streets I’m movin' quick like big ZooWap a landshark
Talking shit, can’t leave your block
That’s how you get your land marked
Heavy cheese, my neck gon' freeze and Gucci Mane my role model
Every time I hit the club, we pop at least ‘bout four bottles
Every time we leave the club, you see all the hoes follow
If that nigga acting crazy, he gon' get the whole hollow
ZooWap, I'm with NittDaGritt, got sympathy for nobody
All they gotta do is cut the check, we go get four Robins
ZooWap I’m with NittDaGritt, got sympathy for nobody
Laser tips will beam you up but baby we don’t know Scotty
All they gotta do is cut the check, we go get four Robins
Laser tips will beam you up but baby we don’t know Scotty
All they gotta do is cut the check, we go get four Robins, Squad!
