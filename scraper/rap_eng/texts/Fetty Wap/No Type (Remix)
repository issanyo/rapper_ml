[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Don’t believe the hype
Remy Boyz, that’s the only squad that they like
We just living life, baby
And we still breathing so we doing something right
Future’s looking bright
Hit it then I dip baby, I can't spend the night
Don’t believe the hype, yeah baby
Remy Boyz, that’s the only squad that they like

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Run me to the plug, all I know is drugs
Check the trunk with chicken, baby know what’s up
ZooWap from the trap, all I count is racks
I’m a skinny nigga, g-got a couple tats
I rep the squad, put it on my back
All I rep is Jersey, put us on the map
Baby girl I’m juggin', baby girl I’m juggin'
She gon' call my phone, baby leave me alone, baby
All I want is goddamn bands, ZooWap I’m the goddamn man
Baby, all I want is goddamn bands, w-we the squad baby
Yeaaaaaaaaaah, squad! Ohhooooooooh baby

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Montana Bucks]
He ain’t in the hood, he ain’t in the trap
He ain’t rolling woods, he ain’t where it’s at
He ain’t moving bricks, he ain’t on the strip
He ain’t order shit, he ain’t water whip
He ain’t moving units, he don’t really do this
He ain’t getting paper, he ain’t getting mula
And Zoowap be the shooter, couple shots through ya
I’ma hit my jeweler, my new bitch, she a cougar
And she do what I like, mix the lean with the sprite
And she do this every night, and she do this every night
Don’t believe the hype and she do this every night
And I whip it, whip it right, and I whip the, whip the white

[Hook]

[Verse 3: P-Dice]
Smoke, fuck a ho
Said she wan' make love, I sip some lean and fuck her slow
[?] sit on dubs
Bunch of bitches with me every time I leave the club
I’m the shit, I’m the shit, got your bitch on my dick
Cause I’m lit like a Bic, ha
I’m the shit, I’m the shit, got your bitch on my dick
Cause I’m lit like a Bic, ha
Smoking eighths about to P, whether we skate, is up to me
Weather be crazy, make it rainy, wherever them heffers be
Smoking eighths about to P, whether we skate, is up to me
Weather be crazy, make it rainy, wherever them heffers be
