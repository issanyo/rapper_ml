[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
How you gunna beef with the shooter?
What, you tryna get hit or something?
Ugly ass bitch better sit down
Now, you tryna throw a diss or something?
Said you got niggas tryna get me
Like they don’t show me where you live or something
Like I won’t run up in your shit or something
And make sure everybody hit or something
Look, I be in the trap making flips or something
How you getting money? You ain’t flipping nothing
Fuck boy hating ain’t getting nothing
This motherfucking forty shot the hit or something
Look, niggas screaming Wap like I’m missing something
No money getting niggas, you ain’t spending nothing
Niggas screaming Wap like I’m missing something
No money getting niggas, you ain’t spending nothing
Back in the box though, Zoowap with the Wap flow
My dick in her tonsils, she suck it and swallow
Back in the box though, ZooWap with the Wap flow
My dick in her tonsils, she suck it and swallow

[Hook: P-Dice]
Everybody talking ‘bout us
Yeah, that’s the way it sounding (way it sounding)
Yeah, I know you lil niggas fly
But, we they favorite pilots (favorite pilots)
I just finished cooking up some shit
And I ain’t even turn on the palette (turn on the palette)
I just finished cooking up some shit
And I ain’t even turn on the palette
Cashing, that’s all that I do
I cannot play with you lames
Your bms get wild with the crew
But, nigga, I ain’t saying no names
Cashing, that’s all that I do
I cannot play with you lames
Your bms get wild with the crew
But, nigga, I ain’t saying no names, let’s go

[Verse 2: P-Dice]
I’m with your babymother, she said she heard that I’m crazy
So I give her crazy loving
Usually I be bugging, when it come to throwing fetty
Baby, I think nothing of it
I just wanna climb and you cannot be in my future
Baby, I’m just being honest
Obviously I’m shining, see you looking at my Muller
Man, just ask me what the time is
I probly say it’s time to win yo
Time to hit these moitherfuckers where they live
Now, you wanna be friends yo
And tryna start, why the fuck would you begin?
I be flowing different with it chilling in my whip
It’s tinted and I got the smith’n in it
I got that machine gun homie
If your team come, it go ridididididit
You ain’t a ho so what the fuck you looking at me for lil nigga?
If I wanted your opinion, I’d ask you for it lil nigga
You and your homies joke and play all day, all bunch of lil niggas
No matter how much bread you make, you always gon be a lil nigga
