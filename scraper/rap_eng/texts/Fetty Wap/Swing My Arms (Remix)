Anything that you want, you can get it, ayy
And everything that you want, I am with it, ayy
You said you want a car, I got you two baby, ayy
You said you need a bag, you got a few baby, ayy
Everything you get cause it's what you want baby, ayy

Dip and I dab, dip and I dab
The way I hit dem folks they think that I’m mad
They think that I’m mad
Hopped out the Porsche like it’s a cab
Like it’s a cab
I’m swervin' on ‘em but I bet I won’t crash
I bet I won’t crash
Straight up, straight up
You know they hate us
With the lines that they make up
Straight up from the bottom
You know it made us
Now we playing with paper
I don’t play no games but I’m still player
It’s Rickey for mayor
Ballin’ on em like I’m practicing lay-ups
Cool as Himalayas
