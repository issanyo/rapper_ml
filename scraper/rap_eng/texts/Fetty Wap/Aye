[Verse 1]
17, we ain't playin', ayy
15 car garage, ayy
Shit still ain't enough, ayy
Bank account got the most, ayy
I saved bread from the start, ayy
Show money for 15, ayy
Now shit changed a lot, ayy
Six houses 20 cars, ayy
Seven hundred thousand on some jewelry
Now they know a nigga livin' large, ayy
All of them push to starts, ayy
Weed stank like a fart, ayy
Red dot got a mark, ayy
Let it fly, we're in the car, ayy
Fake tough, he ain't hard
Ayy, I was way smarter than niggas
Ayy, I got way farther than niggas
Ayy, I ain't play cards with these niggas
Ayy, I ain't chill out, I ain't take numbers, I ain't play a part of these niggas
Ayy, it was RGF, either win or lose but still sharkin' these niggas
Ayy, Banshee Park on these niggas
Ayy, I pull up parkin' these niggas
Ayy, I was never friendly, it was never envy
Say "real recognize real"
Ayy, I ain't sign for no deal
Ayy, banked up a couple mill
Ayy, me and 4k fo'real
Ayy, pull up on ya big wheel
Ayy, niggas eatin' big meals
Ayy, all day big krill
Ayy, 90 y'all burn to shit
Ayy, that's a million dollar buildin'
Ayy, I kept fuckin' up my pack
Ayy, I ain't ever reach a million
Ayy, 12 hunnit that's the block
Ayy, Harlem World, that's the hood
Ayy, Pill squad, party packs
Ayy, young niggas eatin' good
Ayy, fuck nigga try to go against me
And now he's stuck for real
Ayy, I guess he's stuck in Pyur hell
Ayy, it was such a pure fail
Ayy, tell that nigga farewell
Ayy, pure white big scale
Ayy, beige color, fish scale
Ayy, I play my numbers real well (Wap)

Mmmm, ayy
Mmmm, ayy
Mmmm, ayy
Mmmm, ayy, baby
