[Intro: Fetty Wap]
Made a dollar outta 15 cents, ayy

[Verse 1: Hazel E]
Okay you know I'm straight out Houston, Texas
In other words, bitch you know I'm flexin'
Diamonds on me, dancin', know you see me
Got on TV just to put on for my city
I told her I'm ready, I'm wit it
Baby be all about stackin' them commas
You talkin' this money, let's get it
Look how we ballin', yeah look how we ballin'
Some people just might get offended
I still pull up in that custom new Porsche
And they sick cause [?]

Ain't worried bout no broke because I got it

[Verse 2: Luce Cannon]
Back then they didn't want me
Now I'm hot, they all on me
Got a check on 'em, I'll flex on 'em
Never scared of my next opponent
Shawn Kemp, that 40 on me
I'm iced out, that Rollie on me
It's lights out like [?]
Fetty Wap with the scope on me
My bands go up like its halftime
Foreign cars, that's the fast life
Bad bitches, that's what we like
Actavis with a lot of Sprite
Livin' life like my last night
I take risks cause I game 'em right
Know I'm paid in full, my doors night
She get money, mention my money ain't right
Her pussy drippin' like a candle stick
Long dick can he handle it
I give you the fix like the maintenance man
Pussy poppin' on the handstand
I don't beat it up, I go to work
I murder shit, no "ambulam"
You know what's up, let's get to it
You know what's up, let's get to it
