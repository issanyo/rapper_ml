[Hook]
Was a lotta times,  felt like we wasn't gonna make it
Niggas came and niggas left, they fake
I'm living life like a dream, please don't wake me
I promised all my niggas, we gonna make it
[x2]

[Verse 1]
The promises that I made, I won't break
And all my niggas hooligans, they crazy
Then nigga's plans got fucked up and they hating
The story of how we came up is amazing
Said Nit the grit said grind hard and be patient
Now shit happenin' just like he said
That disrespect can get you beheaded
Lobster, steak, egg whites for breakfast
Rock Robin jeans cuz they make me feel better
Just dropped 'bout a car note and a letter
Said Zoo Gang, my niggas do it better
Said Zoo Gang, my niggas do it better
RGF the squad, welcome to the island
1738, niggas know I'm wildin'
RGF the squad, welcome to the island
1738, niggas know I'm wildin'
RGF the squad, welcome to the island
1738, niggas know I'm wildin' baby

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I promised all my niggas we gon' make it
I'm ballin' like the muthafuckin' Lakers
I made my decision and now we winning
RGF the island, come and join
Nit the grit be wildin', boy we on
And that's what hella ganja light it up
Don't fuck 'round with my niggas, I will off ya
I swear to God, all my niggas do this often
I'm stackin' up this green, but I'm not from Boston
Gotta watch out for them snakes, Stone Cold Steve Austin
And every time you see my niggas be flossin'
My pockets look like P-Dice, I'm so awesome
And I am [?] so awesome
You try any of my niggas I swear I'll off ya
Hold the bands and racks I swear I'm flowin'
You try any of my niggas I swear you dying
