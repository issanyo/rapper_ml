[Intro]
Ohhhh-uhhh
Monty, Zoovie

[Hook: Monty + Fetty Wap]
All Gucci, Louis, Fendi, Hermes my belt
We had to get it and we did it ourselves
Just a couple niggas throw away with no help
And we gon' get this money my nigga nothin' else
Nothin' else, ain't nothin' else
Nothin' else, ain't nothin' else
Fuck my hoes
Nothin' else, ain't nothin' else
Fuck knicks
Nothin' else, ain't nothin' else
Nothin' else, ain't nothin' else

[Verse 1: Monty]
Got a son, he gotta eat
Gotta live, gotta sleep
In the morning, brush his teeth
Big boy, he only 3
Look at him, look at me
And I tell him he could be anything that he wanna be
He don't care and he callin' me
And I pray he safe
When I hit the streets
Gotta gets money
And nothin' else
And I'ma go hard until I got nothin' left
Gotta gets money
And nothin' else
And I'ma go hard until I got nothin' left

[Hook: Monty + Fetty Wap]

And we gon' get this money my nigga nothin' else
Nothin' else, ain't nothin' else
Nothin' else, ain't nothin' else
Fuck my hoes
Nothin' else, ain't nothin' else
Fuck knicks
Nothin' else, ain't nothin' else
Nothin' else, ain't nothin' else

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
I remember days when I ain't had shit, aye
Hard times turned me to a savage, aye
Now I'm livin' good, I'm livin' lavish, aye
Lotta bitches layin' on my mattress, aye
Now a nigga ballin' like the Mavericks, aye
But before iTunes I bring that cash in, aye
Now a nigga ballin' like the Mavericks, aye
But before iTunes I bring that cash in, aye
Louis V and Robert jeans, expensive habits, aye
If he got that shit like me he would do better, aye
And we had the same chance but you let up, aye
Now it's Zoo Gang and now we doin' better, squaa
