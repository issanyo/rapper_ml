[Chorus: Big Bank Black]
Never thought I'd see the day I never wanna see you again
(Never thought I'd see that shit for real)
Never thought I'd see the day I never wanna see you again (Shit crazy)
We'll be over now
(It went over the limit this time baby it's over now)
We are over now

[Verse 1: Big Bank Black]
Never thought I'd see the times that I didn't take your call
(I would never do no shit like that)
Never thought I'd see the day that i despise you girl

Never though I'd say, never ever, ever thought I'd see a time that I didn't need you (I'm straight bitch)
I, I, I don't need you
(Na for real, for real for real)

[Chorus: Big Bank Black]
Never thought I'd see the day I never wanna see you again
