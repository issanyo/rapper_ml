[Intro: Fetty Wap]
Free that boy Tay-K

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Gang with me, we ain't talkin' cash, its irrelevant
Yo' bitch with me, let her rub my chain for the hell of it
Sticks with me he could fuck yo ho if she sellin it
Fetty, we get Fetti it don't matter how you spellin' it
Yeah, pull up to his spot like what is up, nigga
I got shootas' with me in the cut, nigga
He be dead 'fore I hit the blunt, nigga
On the hood, this ain't what he want, nigga
Keep a 50 with me in the trunk, nigga
Put the family on the cap and funk, nigga
Wouldn't give a fuck if a slug hit ya
All this money I just get a rush nigga
When the money came I fell in love wit her
You know I fell in love wit her

[Verse 2: Fli Fetti]
Ay
I know these niggas feel some type of way
But all they do is hop up on the internet and type away
I ain't the type to play my hitters, bring it right away
You hear them tires skirrt, them fireworks gon' light away
If Zoovie send a hit
Then the goonies bend the shit
If we in the buildin' its gon' be a movie in this bitch
Don't pay attention to these niggas cuz they all lame
I'm livin' next to Fabulous I call it Ball-cane
This for the muscle at the hustle like a ball game
All I do is ball man so all I do is ball mane
Designer shit these shootings they gon' call it lit
I said you ain't my kind of chick but thank you for the compliment
Mind on my money I've been hungry tryna' find a lift
I get suppliers tripped, Like what you need I got it here
A bunch of small timers talkin' like they push a lot
I smoke one hella sour
I don't do the kush a lot
Wap set it up they waitin' for the hood to pop
My pocket full of guap, they call me mister jig alot
