[Intro]
Yeah, ay, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Squaaa

[Chorus]
Everytime I see her leave her star struck
Please give me a reason, what you come for?
She just wanna chill, start the car up
Chillin' in the coupe with the doors up
Money on the cane, got my [?] off
Money on the chain like they don't know us
Quick to let it bang, I got my flows off
Smoking Mary Jane, I got my flows on

[Verse 1]
I be doing money at my shows, take a little money on the road
Make it lit and then I let it go
Then I get some more, and buy some more, yeah
Zoovie always switchinâ€™ up his flows, yeah
Sometimes I like the [?], sometimes the roads, yeah
Sometimes I like the word that yellow road, yeah
And I got more whippin' by the stove, yeah

[Chorus]
E-e-everytime I see her leave her star struck
Please give me a reason, what you come for?
She just wanna chill, start the car up
Chillin' in the coupe with the doors up
Money on the cane, got my [?] off
Money on the chain like they don't know us
Quick to let it bang, I got my flows off
Smoking Mary Jane, I got my flows on

[Verse 2]
I'mma have to make or break it down baby (baby, baby)
Get up on it then she make a sound, baby (baby, baby)
Hop up in my car and take a ride, baby (baby, baby)
Drop the top and then look at the sky, baby (baby, baby)
California [?] me, can't hide, baby (baby, baby)
Carats on your neck, check out the size, baby (baby, baby)
Lookin' in your face, grippin' your thighs, baby (baby, baby)
I can see the look up in your eyes, baby (baby, baby)

[Chorus]
E-e-everytime I see her leave her star struck
Please give me a reason, what you come for?
She just wanna chill, start the car up
Chillin' in the coupe with the doors up
Money on the cane, got my [?] off
Money on the chain like they don't know us
Quick to let it bang, I got my flows off
Smoking Mary Jane, I got my flows on

[Outro]
Ay, yeah baby, ay
Smoking Mary Jane, I got my flows on
Ay, ay, yeah baby, ay
Smoking Mary Jane, I got my flows on
