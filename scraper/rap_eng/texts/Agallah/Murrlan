[Verse 1: ZAVAGE]
You live you ain't the hero, you die you ain't the villain
Maybe that's why Swipey ain't live to see a million
You the artist now I gotta paint how it's meant to be
Cause every last one of y'all suck in the DMV
Whatchu know about a bar? Shoulda stayed in the trap bruh
Fresh outta P.G, but it can get rated R
See they ruined it for fun so I might triple up my funds
And unload like three guns on the whole 301
You on Spinrilla don't mean whatchu spinning is realer
Moving like Ben Stiller till my rims can get the spinners
I would name drop
But y'all would just think that I'm being bitter when I'm better
And different the way I whip it all together
Kicking in the truth like cinnamon, hard to swallow
Now they sensitive and quick to fill a clip with hallows
DMV, get to chopping with the drum like XIB
Be a scenario everyday on ya scene

[Hook 2x: ZAVAGE]
Cuz you, was never gang gang
And ya crew, they never bang bang
Bump fame, this just me killing the game
I'll turn Murrlan to my murder lane

[Verse 2: Deaize]
It's dapper Deaize and I go the apest
You bamma's shadow me, a basement
Dressed in all black cause I was born in the matrix
You didn't expect this from the replacements replacement
Yeah, I started from the negative count
We recognize that the game is a battle of clout
And even still I don't care what y'all speak about
Cuz you can tell that I'm taking a different route (for real)
You running up on me it's Mob Fiction
No one supports a lack of quality (nope)
Flameous is a movement you can follow me
I know niggas suffering that non fiction (straight up)
And I refuse to be a captive, Thats why this the second time we did this track
You lames twitter directing you think you a map?
Well tell them maps that they just met the atlas (yeah)
And imma take it world wide, slaving on the beat you can see it in my eyes
They hate me cause I'm posed to be that "actor guy"
When I got the lyrics for anybody to die (slaughter)
Cuz I ain't going like nothing, Talk to god like he my big cousin
So the blessings be the toughest (Deaize)
S on my chest boy you know that I'm stunting

[Hook2x]

[Bridge]
This gone make you chop aye
This might hurt yo block aye
And I put it on mothers aye
We ain't going like nothing
I said this, this gone make you chop aye
Nah this might hurt yo block aye
Watch out for the wave
Aye watch out for the wave

[Verse 3: ZAVAGE]
Think you the real rap cuz you ain't rapping bout guns?
Boy you think you cool son cuz you get none, it's all done
Your new generation needs remodeling like a facelift
Cut out the whining, at this point the game don't need saving
I spit with diction, listen to what was written in my composition
We caught em slipping and started the slapping the competition
Into a different pigment now they sea sick
Cuz I flow like waves, no durag when I speak it
I'm close to shawdy body like spandex
Quick to pop you in the mouth like a Xanax, uh
The metal crashing when I go to smack a ratchet with this hatchet can't hack it cuz the zavage is too fantastic
Wait it's getting too hot someone fan me down
Don't drop names but he said he making moves in town
Leave a microphone smoking like a puff of the loud
Don't wanna get caught, said Zay I'm too young to go to trial
All I could do, was dap that man he gave a smile
Told him keep ya head up brotha and just pray for a while
Security found his stash, no tears in his eyes
He walked away without a charge like his phone died
Trust in God, he always by yo side, no lies
I was never one to go and shook and jive
And that ain't on some go and try and be cool ish
That's stupid, these just people I happen to go to school with
Said young Zay you real, trynna cop this purp?
Had to hit em with the "Nah my man I got homework"
Same nerd since the third I just murk the words
With slurs, giving curves when they work my nerves
Them outta state kids seasoned salty like old bay
Oh wait I forgot that's a Maryland thang
