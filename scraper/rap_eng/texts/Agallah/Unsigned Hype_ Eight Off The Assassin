Being born on May 8th and rhyming since the age of eight, the 8-letter name, “Eight Off,” came automatic, he admits.

     When Legion Of DUME (Unsigned Hype—June ’92) member Schott Free first introduced me to Eight Off, I wondered what this little 18-year-old, skinny Puerto Rican kid could really do. Later that day, in a cipher on the roof, I found out.

     Before he even started rhyming, Eight Off represented with a fat beat box while various members of his crew, Nappy Assassins, caught wreck. Then, off the head a capella, he kicked a rhyme with a flow unlike anything out now. Veins started popping out of all exposed body parts.

     Since then, Eight Off has gone into the studio and recorded tracks with Bobby Crawford (who produced cuts for Tim Dog’s album) and Doug King (who produced most of Scarface’s album). Song titles alone should give you an idea of where his head’s at lyrically: “Blow Up The Earth,” “Illified Lunatic,” “Livin’ and Sellin’ Buddha Out Of My Ice Cream Truck,” and “My Name Ain’t Hitler” but he’s definitely gonna hit ya.

     Eight Off has most recently signed with 720 management (YZ’s company) and is currently scoping out labels.
