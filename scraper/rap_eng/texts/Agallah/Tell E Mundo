[Verse One]
I ain't a player I just make a lot
Take a shot with a vacant lot, drug worker make a spot
Agallah beats make the Earth quake a lot
I get my dick sucked so much my head ache a lot
You bitch niggas on the ave like to fake a lot
I got more weed than all them Jamaicans got
Phil Jackson trade Shaq, who the Lakers got?
Next year it's the Knicks in six, we make it hot
Telephone, tell a friend, tell e mundo
Not a Puerto Rican but I'm speaking so that you know
When it come to rhyming Sean Price numero uno
When it come to killing Agallah, kicking your culo
I don't give a fuck you got a yacht or a few boats
Do pot or you do coke in a drop over Hugo
Still come through and bust a shot through your two do'
All you see is blood and feathers leaking out your new coat
Shorty wop is young but on the low she kinda cute though
We fuck, don't tell bitch I can't Buttafuoco
Might see me clowning on the 'ville, only a few know
How a nigga get down when his motherfucking [?]

[Hook]
Yo, telephone, tell a friend, tell e mundo
Ruck and Agallah, black and Puerto Rican duo
Hottest thing popping since The Jacksons and Menudo
Beats, rhymes and lifestyle, we keep it true though

[Verse Two]
I ain't a rapper I just take time
With a pad and a pen, a bag of weed and I make rhymes
Y'all hate mine that's what I'm hearing through the grapevine
But with or without y'all niggas I'mma make mine
Why waste time responding about this and that?
Yadda yadda yadda, get your gat
Duke, I'm straight sick with that
Smoke weed through a checkpoint cause my plates say diplomat
Yo
Y'all niggas ain't reaching the kids
Ya faggot fuck, Adebisi lives
