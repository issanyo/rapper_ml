My brother hit me with a kite and told me I was iLL
Said your bars be helping my sentence we both got time to kill//
You're Timeless but I'll b home soon
Heard you getting busy 2015, but don't forget the old school//
You gotta show dudes rules & regulations
Like take these beats, and black out like segregation//
This the occupation taught me to embrace the hatred
So I come baring arms holding two straps like a mental patient//
Got the mental patients of a Rubik's scrambler nigga
Dance toe to toe with Satan I'm a life gambler nigga//
Ballin' out now watch me handle you niggas
Pop a rapper over hip hop's a crossover you can be hit records will break pull out my camera niggas
I'm talking like I was Notorious
So you can call me Christopher Walken The king...//
A Queens baby Queens made me this mellow
Found out the keys to life, some day's I lock myself in the ghetto I'm guilty//
For being filthy with the script like XXX flicks
The truck's moving diesel I'm driving without a vin//
Keep some ice cubes to soothe my glass of gin
In the stu all I need is my crew then I begin//
I mic checker like the 1st 3 Jordan's I'm retro
I never let go the fact I couldn't afford em
The reason that I grind is for my future
The reason I still rhyme is cause' producers think I'm the rappin' Akuma//
I'm in the building chillin I'm the super
Cause' in this rotten apple I'm still mackin' like computers//
Consuming more liquor than coolers
Shorty grabs it lick it and cools it I stab it pound it and wound it
Hide the package where her stool is//
Since a school student I remained the truest
Never back down it'll just be me give a fuck who you dudes is//
And even if I'm cool with you don't play me like I'm stupid
I go crazier than you could, that's why I remain reclusive//
When I'm around there's cupids heart eyes pop out her pupils
Gotta love it when ELO come's around with new exclusives//
Become a nuisance I chuck up the deuces
Y'all couldn't hang with me if y'all had nooses I'm good
Still kick the chair where you stood//
Choke as I toke tip the tip of my blunt in the trey
Drinking my juice in the hood, Feeling myself as I should//

Been feeling like a Saturday Night...
All day...
We ain't even gotta go f*&^ with the club...
Just kick back and chill... Just kick back and chill...
Where ever we at...
We can do it...
We can do that shhh...
We can do it...
We ain't even gotta go F*&^ with the club
We can do it...
We can do that shhh...
We can do it...
