Ghetto girl
All over the world, all over the world! C'mon!
"All you want is love and affection" - Eric B & Rakim 'Eric B Is President'

[Verse One]
To all the ladies looking fly with their hair done and their nails done
8-Off The Assassin is representing
True love
Straight from the heart to come see
Don't sleep
I'll have you weak under the sheets I'll make you feel good
Like you never ever felt before
From the living room to the bed room then on to the kitchen floor
Flex with me, just sit next to me
The only thought running through your mind is just to have sex with me
Squeeze ya tight, I'll make it right
I'm the type to dim the lights and freak you all night, aiiiiight?
And if you smoke lah, we can spark
I still be with it if you let me hit in the park after dark
Can we have sex on the swings?
Girl, time to let you know 8-Off got a good thing
Bottom line is you are the world
Never phony, my one and only ghetto girl

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
I'm guaranteed to get you sprung With the tip of my tongue
Whether you're old or you're young girl I get the job done
I got you on the run
Searching for 8-Off to make you cum
If I was to go raw baby you would be the one
Girl you know it's true, all I want is you, yeah me and you
Together forever a real nigga will take care of you
Buy you clothes when you need and give you food when you want it
I always kept it real I never fronted
When it comes down to making it right
8-Off The Assassin will make it through the night so hold me tight
Tighter than [?] bear hug
I know sex is addicting like a new drug
You got a boyfriend but like you said he just a boy
8-Off can bring you much more than joy
Respect
Check the tech'
I'll make you wet then light your cigarette so girl don't forget you're my...

[Verse Three]
When I look at you, sometimes you have me zoning
Fiending to get you naked and at the mouth I'm foaming
So let's start the boning cause it's too late in the night
Plus I wouldn't mind if you wanted to rock a mic
So instead of a wet dream, get a cherry and whip cream I'll make you scream
As long as the punnany's clean
I even do the R. Kelly on your belly
But I ain't gonna be messing with a chicken if the nappy dugout dirty
Oh well, time to search for another fish in the sea
I ain't trying to get my heart broken baby
Maybe we could have a family in this crazy world
No doubt, this goes out to the...
