[Chorus: Agallah]
R-I-D-E, we O-U-T
This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G
This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G
(We ride out) R-I-D-E, we O-U-T
This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G
This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G
(We ride out)

[Verse 1: Agallah + The Alchemist]
This is off of the meters, this is off the chain
Al cook up the dope, I’ma bring him the ‘caine
We just bring ‘em the flame, and just bring ‘em the pain
Cocked back, ready to aim (O.G.G.G.)
Yo, yeah, we rock and we roll
Yeah, we chop up the soul
Rappers need some of the dope, so they cop and they blow
But do I get the dough? You already know
(This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G.)
Yeah, we still runnin’ the streets, don’t fuck with a beast
Always roll with a fleet, always roll with a piece
You act up, yeah, these bullets is hotter than grease
When that Mac release (O.G.G.G.)
Yo, you looking for a wife, all my bitches are nymphos
Your CD’s a Frisbee, throw your shit out the window
But bang your instrumental, yo, it’s a fuckin’ rental
(This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G.)

[Chorus: Agallah]
(We ride out) R-I-D-E, we O-U-T
This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G
This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G
(We ride out) R-I-D-E, we O-U-T
This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G
This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G

[Verse 2: Agallah + The Alchemist]
Yo, it’s simple, me and Al is the truth when we hop in the booth
They say he’s Charlie Manson, then I’m Rae Carruth
Ain’t shit pretty and cute, nigga, just give me the loot
Cock it off, spray and shoot (This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G.)
Up in the studio, we gettin’ blown, we don’t pick up the phone
At the sound of the tone, leave me the fuck alone
(*For the fifth degree, hang up after the tone*)
(This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G.)
Yes sir, I’m that nigga for life, fucking bitches and dykes
Copping Bentleys and ice, see me rolling the dice
See me rolling shiest, you piff, y’all paying the price
(This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G.)
Don’t have to sell you nothin’, my work is handled for me
Don’t have to you nothin’, it’s self-explanatory
I ain’t afraid of nothin’, stay out my category
(This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G.)

[Chorus: Agallah]
(We ride out) R-I-D-E, we O-U-T
This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G
This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G
(We ride out) R-I-D-E, we O-U-T
This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G
This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G
(We ride out)
(We ride out)
This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G
(We ride out)
This is so gangsta, O.G.G.G
