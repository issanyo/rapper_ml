You need to lay low... "Capice"



[Rapper 1] [intro]
(let)'s get money, lu this money man
(maiso?)... it's money all day man
Big faces... Hundred to fifties... passing on twenties all day
Rolling up that piff, that Propain shit
That's why me and my team's getting hurt,  niggas getting money

[Rapper 1]
Every day of the month
Is like the first to me
I love getting money man, it's simple to me
I step on the streets like (Pyrellis and D's?)
My (n...?) through the city screaming: fuck the police
(Truck?) full of money, so I can do me
At the end of the day man, imma do me
I'm (?) for the cream, Propain's the team
My niggas real humble but their money is made
Picture this streets niggas man as living their dreams
Driving big cars, hood rock stars
(Po...?)   on the scene and we all pop off
We living the life, I'm showing off tonight
Diamonds in the air so you know the guns' in here
Bitches getting horny of the atmosphere
Propain, Campain, the team of the year
Come join the army, the virgins' in here


[Refrain]
Love getting man
Let's get this money man
I love getting money man
Let's get this money
[X4]


[Agallah]
In the hood
They used to called me paper chaser
But now, they call me the paper maker
No more playin' around, imma raise the stakes up
So much zeros, they'll fuck you face up
Real nigga came up selling white and dope
Eminem came up, he the great white hope
That hard white had my nigga Stan the flow
The only hard white to touch was Bars the soap
Real talk! Got flipping that baking soda
Them two quarters got me fuckin' wit that Coca-Cola
Call my broker over and make that deal
Stack and bars, nigga imma make that mill'
Cake so real mom, dudes' paying the bills
N' she rests in peace, nigga, I' m out of these streets
Now I don't give a fuck about y'all or the police
Come against me and my "guap", my thang's goin' speak
(Ignit?)


[Refrain]
Love getting man
Let's get this money man
I love getting money man
Let's get this money
[X4]


[Rapper 3]
Yo bad nigga, don't misinterpret!
Fuck you mean, what you see is all on purpose
All ya nervous da Campain
Paying in town the champagne
In a range, very close to the thang
Get (jamped?) up, you better man up motherfucker
'Cause ain't nothing fucking but Propain
Getting close range
Ya niggas making rain, I see ya!
My niggas pop off, it's like hurricane Katrina
We getting here in drama
Yall gotta have a constant flow of cash
To getting yo ass
Have some little niggas chasing your stab
Down to half, from here to down south
With some big booty bitch tongue ring in her mouth
Two stack to throw out, let's roll out
Takes them bitches home
But every time, it's a new route
Given caf√©, then we off to the loo house
Ya thing that it's a game, but that's the Campain
Ya niggas (lazy?)...


[Refrain]
Love getting man
Let's get this money man
I love getting money man
Let's get this money
[X4]
