Intro/Chorus:

Somebody told me that this rap shit was fun
You get to smoke mad weed and hold big guns
Stand on stage rockin your Timbs wit your sons
That's bullshit, yo I'm out to get these funds

Verse One: 8-Off Aguilar

Yo, yo, somebody told me I threw a hot joint wit Das
Courtesy a' EPMD, Aguilar, recognize
Niggas was stuck on Diggy before Biggie and Nas
Test guy reported in The Source, even thought about "Best Buys"
My 12-bar Count Dracula wit lyrics spectacular
Sippin out of Coke and he's drinkin' Pterodactyl-a's in chromed Acuras
Challenge any one wit balls nothing, rock the hardest
Racoons rap wit your soloists and various artists
Puttin it down on the J-9000 SSL wit stories to tell
Off those cells we're livin well
In the '9-8-Off, country club plink off
While you're way off, check all systems, it's time we take off

Chorus (x2)

Verse Two: Nocturnal

Guns with banana clips, two Rolex's to master whips
A .45 under my armpit
Another one in the glove compartment
Money startin shit, the brand new shoes on space ships
Tek 9's, after parties with mad dimes
Bitches twist the vine, I'm high and the moon's mine
We're out to get mines, on a regular
On the south, probably took the dreaded predator's pirate treasure
In the crib I bought the leather, plus a movie screen
So my team can play Sega plus Garcia-Vega's
An ounce of weed in every type of flavor
Bank accounts wit fat paper, a major player cos....

Chorus

Verse Three: Das EFX

HIGGITY-HARDCORE, sewer rats keep it raw
Beach houses and more, puffin weed on Seymour
Pliggity-plush carpets cover floors, on bus tours
Chrome .44's, diggity-diamonds on paws
All my slick cats above the laws, higgity-hide records in stores
HIT SQUAD, second world tour
Kiggity-cameras compass on doors, signin autographs
After, and before, where?, In corridors
Figgity-fuck wars, I'm buildin, splittin Dutches spillin
Chillin until these pilgrims start ice grillin
Figgity-frontin hard like a villian, Das EFX'll make a killin
And grab the cheese up like Sicilians cos......

Chorus (x2)

Outro: Skoob

Get the funds
This rap shit was fun, kid
We hold big guns, diamond gems, Timbs and all that
