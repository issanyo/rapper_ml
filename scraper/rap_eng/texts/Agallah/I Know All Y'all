[Hook]
"Jealous niggas on the dick" - PMD
I know all y'all
Where all y'all?

[Verse One]
Let's take this back like Le Tigra shirts
With the flannel
Me and my cousins going toe to toe over switching the channel
Had to regulate the TV
I was trying to watch, couldn't miss Ralph McDaniels video music Box
I used to sit there, absorbing the shit, something amazing
Fly gear, sneakers, rocking the ropes, I was gazing
Should've listened to my mom dukes kid, then I started praying
All the best rappers is winding up dead, nahmasayin?
In 24 years of my life, I never thought I'd get cut with a knife
Should've never went to The Tunnel out that night
Got caught in a fight
Niggas went to jail, what the hell?
Conspiracy on the god Agallah, wait till the fucking album sell
Ringing the bells

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
I got a hard working family, my aunt serving in the Army now
I got a call from [?] they turn my application down
We use the oven for heat
And I was cooking bars of food for my neighbors
That's how it is in Brooklyn
Thank the good looking
When the electricity ran out
I put the extension cord right up to my man and them house
We gon' throw away the pissy couch and get a new one
More burners more gats to make you and your fucking crew run
Like Sonny Carson when he got beat with sticks and poles
The Devil wants to take my soul, he hates when I roll
I'm in control
8-Off, I never lost
How the fuck y'all gon' focus with your Polaroids off?
8-Off

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
To my Puerto Rocks and my negros
Don't get my wrong
I'm gonna discover new flows like I'm Ponce De Leon
8-Off Assassin
Kick it for the rugged not the fashion
Beats and rhymes are my passion
One on one I blast on
Ain't nobody to hate, but shit hate me all
You got jams see it stalled, be prepared to fall
Silent off the corner poles screaming out your death
No more time left
Hurry up and take your breath
It's pretty fun going out with a bottle of Henny and my gun
15 shots inside of you' chest and you're still not stunned
Tried to run
And led [?] what way to turn
Lean down with eight rounds
Blood clot ya done done

[Hook]
