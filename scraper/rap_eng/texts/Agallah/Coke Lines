[Verse 1: Ras Kass]
Nigga you still my Stan, mad he can't fade us
So you should hang yourself like Tyler the Creator
Life ain't fair: a saint gets aborted
A serial killer is born, evil gets rewarded
Dear Lord, ya'll vision is distorted
And I wanna save the World but my budget can't afford it
But I deserve that gwap like Kanye and Curtis
A Mayweather life before I lay in riggormortis
43-0 on the mic retire perfect
Couple new niggas hot now they claiming he the furnace?!
They ask if Ras could spit on the sun and burn it
Is Sandusky guilty? You already know the verdict
Yeah! im in the club poppin bottles of Moet
With a Magic Johnson portable AIDS test
Staring up this dames dress, but I dont mean no harm
Amino acid ratchet rap rapid fire bars

[Hook]
Life is like sniffing up a coke line

[Verse 2: Agallah]
Ayo Listen, life is like sniffing up a coke line
Took a scripture out of the Bible and I wrote mine
I'm so prolific like a prophet when I quote lines
Barmageddon with bars, Scarface the world is mine
Dollar bills I'mma burn it, the System I overturn it
New government is emerging, ya'll doin alot of splurging
Its like I'm fucking a virgin, no, my dick is determined
I'm spitting verbal vermin, hate rats like Mark Furman
This gargoyle rap music make you wanna act stupid
Ignorant son of a bitch - fuck Rap Music!
Whites doing black music, blacks doing white music
We can all get along and make Fight Music
I live this shit, I dont even like music
Rather do a heist to it silence the lambs
Most niggas in my hood is dying ofr grams

[Hook]

[Bridge: Agallah]
Me and Ras set up shop
I came with the pot
Cooked it on the stove top
Til it formed to a rock
Tell Shorty hit the block
We about to get the gwap
Dont talk to the cops
Respect me like your Pops

[Ras Kass]
Me and Ag set up shop
He came with the pot
Cooked it on the stove top
Til it formed to a rock
Tell Shorty hit the block
We about to get the gwap
Dont talk to the cops
Respect me like your Pops

[Hook]
