[Don Bishop Agallah]
Nah c'mon I got the weed here
You ain't gotta go to them niggas to get it
Listen man I know what you want

You know I got that purple haze, a little bit of 'dro
I spark my weed up, and now I got my blunt on fire
(Want some weed, want some weed, want some weed, want some weed)
(Want some weed, want some weeeed, let's smoke, let's smoke)
That purple haze, a little bit of 'dro
I spark my weed up, and now I got my blunt on fire
(Want some weed, want some weed)
(Want some weed, want some weeeed, let's smoke, let's smoke)

Girl I'm ready to pursue this, yeah I'm ready to do this
Bring all the jump offs from the hood that you cool with
While I'm tryin to get a nice four, bring me a nice whore
Bitches ugly but pussy's bangin when you turn the lights off
I'm about to pipe off, I'ma set the night of
Met shorty between Dekalb and Wycoffe
She in love with assassin every day cause I be smashin
All I gotta do is smoke her out and let her sip the passion
Put my, dick in her ass and she'll, make me bust fast and
Get my, money off pimpin bitch you better make it happen
When my paper get to stackin, that's how I got it crackin
Kanye produced this joint but on Bloods I'ma jack him

For the purple haze, a little bit of 'dro
I spark my weed up, and now I got my blunt on fire
(Want some weed, want some weed, want some weed, want some weed)
(Want some weed, want some weeeed, let's smoke, let's smoke)
That purple haze, a little bit of 'dro
I spark my weed up, and now I got my blunt on fire
(Want some weed, want some weed)
(Want some weed, want some weeeed, let's smoke, let's smoke)

Purple haze, geah, ha ha!
That's all I smoke nigga
That's the only thing I know
I'm up outta here
