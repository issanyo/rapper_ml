[Intro: DJ Premier & Agallah]
Hmm
New York Ryder Music
Ride
"Alright"
Can't believe it

[Verse 1]
It's Propane and Premo, he's Scorsese, I'm Pacino
He a Gang Starr legend, I'm a real OG though
It's that New York rider music they bump in the streets, yo
My Brownsvillain niggas that be letting that heat go
The streets know, and plus the police chief know
It's deep in New York, we be playing for keeps, yo
Get caught slipping, yeah, we rock you to sleep, yo
"Alright"
My city's a problem, straight Bronx, Brooklyn to Harlem
Niggas try to maintain, they're start 'em
In Queens, they're robbing, snatch their wallies out then stomp them
So don't come around here often
From OT flossing, you get sent back in the coffin
Staten Island, yeah, they're known for extortion
New Yorkers will kill you, young shotters quick to peel you
If you ain't gangster, we will reveal you
Preem

[Chorus]
"Alright", "This is all real"
This that New York rider music, that New York rider music
"If you think this is the end, this is only the beginning
It's that New York rider music, playing for keeps
"Alright", "This is all real"
This that New York rider music, that New York rider music
"If you think this is the end, this is only the beginning
It's that New York rider music, playing for keeps

[Verse 2]
Yo
My west coast homies, rep LA, from Watts to Compton
In the Bay, you don't want no problems
Them dudes will solve 'em, my Detroit players, they mobbing
In the Chi, they be calling me Jordan
Going hard in Houston, OG's in New Orleans
Katrina survivors, those in coffins
Y'all took some losses, New York, we done lost the towers
But we ain't lose hip-hop, it's ours
My New York riders, c'mon, it was born inside us
That's why my state is the livest
Real niggas know that, every time we see a fitted and throwback
Putting grills in your mouth, all that shit is all black
Y'all know that, niggas want to be like Slick Rick
You're 'bout to get Vicked, so think quick
New Yorkers will kill you, young shotters quick to peel you
If you ain't gangster, we will reveal you
Preem

[Chorus]
"Alright", "This is all real"
This that New York rider music, that New York rider music
"If you think this is the end, this is only the beginning
It's that New York rider music, playing for keeps
