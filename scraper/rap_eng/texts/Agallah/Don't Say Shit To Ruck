[Intro]
The fuck is you lookin at
Use your head for more than a hat rack

[Verse 1]
Yo
You will never see me sober
See me on corner with street soldiers
Heat Holders Weed Blowers straight livin la vida loca
Over all the protocols to chase the cheddar
Get this dough then retire like Masen Betha
See yall niggas ain't real duke ya fake forever
I should dig in your pockets and take your leather
Pull a gun up on ya ass now you talk about weight
Weight broke the wagon ya faggot I'm packin' the eight
Snub nose with the gun up close in your grill
Laughin at yall niggas why cuz your supposed to be real
Yo I always been nice, yall ain't notice the skill
And I always been trife, yall dont know that I'm ill
And I'm always in the low so yall dont know that the 'ville
Where I'm from with the guns we get dumb for the skrill
Glock to ya frame, yo I'm always spottin the lame
Put the dot to ya dame burn the watch and the chain

[Pre Hook]
Watch, Chain, Money, Earrings, Fuck

[Hook]
To all them niggas in the street that I sticked and bucked
When you see me dont say shit to Ruck
To all my bitches in the world that I licked and fucked
When you see me dont say shit to Ruck
To all my niggas in my muthafuckin click thats butt
Dont say shit to Ruck

[Verse 2]
Yo, you could never criticize my spot in the game that I solidify
Get rid of I never I'm clever my flows diminish guys remember I
Sean Price tough like Semper Fi send a fly bitch to kill you when most
Would have sent a guy
Yo I come through in the rented ride
Tinted high off of the weed my son was sent to buy
Enough of that though let me tell you what I rap for
Stash dough if not then its back to packing the black four
Relax folks I ain't into clappin no black folks
Unless black clappin I'm clappin right back at black yo
Yo yall ain't ready for the tongue twister
Gun lifter rest in peace Big Pun, miss ya

[Hook]
To all them niggas in the streets that I sticked and bucked
When you see me dont say shit to Ruck
To all them bitches in the world that I licked and fucked
When you see me dont say shit to Ruck
To all my niggas in my click that I think is butt
Dont say shit to Ruck

[Verse 3]
Yo I gets rude with niggas get crude with niggas
Dont rock red but I eat food with niggas
Good height Suge Knight get shrewd with niggas
Look hype good night got nude for niggas
Got cute for niggas Hot boots for niggas
Put her on the ave now she got loot for niggas
Duke wanna fear one Rock shoot this nigga
Brownsville projects I'm not stupid nigga
Duke a lame cat fuck that rock this nigga
Pa came back with the fuckin cops my nigga
Should have shot this nigga now the plot gets thicker
On the run son heres my gun pop this nigga
Can't get locked up can't go up top my nigga
Eating jack mackin all kind of slop my nigga
Worse came to worse and I got knocked my nigga
Saw pah people so I had to chop the nigga

Women with the fro came out dread lock my nigga
Called up my girl and the bitch is not with tha
Long ass bid so no longer Rock with ya

Late night hangin niggas bangin cock in her

[Hook]
To all them niggas in the street that I sticked and bucked

To all them bitches in the world that I licked and fucked
When you see me dont say shit to Ruck
To all them niggas in my muthafuckin click thats butt
