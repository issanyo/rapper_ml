[Verse 1 - Yung Joc]
Aye, nothing like a P$C and Block ENT party nigga
Real niggas with real money, folk seeking Ferraris nigga
Dead bitches everywhere, twenties and fifties, throw them out
Slap them on they derriere, pull the dro and blow it out
If you see a scrub in the club, nigga point him out
Trying in the V.I.P.'s, no love, we throwing them out
Tell them plenty position, nigga stay in your lane
I'm fuck with real niggas like my nigga Kuntry King
So don't give me no lip, HK on my hip, get a hitter for flip
Need a Band-Aid for your drip?
In case you wondering, know how I'm balling where I stay
It's them Boyz 'N' Da Hood, we in the club like aye

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Big Kuntry King]
Give me a bottle of Patron, and a blunt of kush I'm good to go
I'm high as fuck, I'm in "The Matrix", bent on moving slow
Yes I'm the flyest, who told you that? The Oracle
How could you ever doubt me? Ask your hoe she know
Kuntry King (Kuntry King) no question, I'm on it mane
Making busts all in the club, how you do that? I make it rain
And I got some more stacks, I'm finna make it storm bitch
Because you seeing money, don't try, thunder on my hip
P$C and Block in here, T.I.P. Yung Joc in here
That means more pill popping, chicks pop in here
We over here, yeah, tell them this is how high
Popping rubber bands, got them drinks on ice

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - T.I.]
I got a pistol in my pocket, throwing money in the air
Tell them bitches get with pimping, ain't no money over there
Aye, you see Kuntry over there, throwing hundreds in the sky
Yeah this rap shit mine, I'ma run until I die
And you can run and you can hide, and you can talk and you can floss
You be running for your lives when I knock you niggas off
Aye, I can show you how to floss, Chevy with the dual exhaust
The old school cost a hundred thousand cash, real talk
I know you niggas real soft, never be a real boss
Keep kicking and sneak dissing, get them caps peeled off
The verses going to get you hurt, I don't care if the world saw
Your girl just saw me go off with Yung Joc we in the club like

[Chorus]
