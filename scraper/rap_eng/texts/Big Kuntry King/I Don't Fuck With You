[Intro: B.o.B.]
Swag bombs in the sky, here I come
Swag bombs in the sky, it's all over me

[Hook: B.o.B.]
If I don't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
I was fuckin' her friend, now I'm fuckin' her now
If I don't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
If you was my nigga then, then I fuck wit' you now
I fuck wit' you now

[Verse 1: B.o.B.]
It's a cold world when the cash rules
When the cash rules, watch for the jack moves
Watch for my squad, got me covered like tattoos
Plus a nigga got cheddar like Kraft Foods
Fuck wit' you, if you a real nigga, then I fuck wit' you
And if you got a problem, we could troubleshoot
Send a text to your nigga, let him try to shoot

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Ball-hitter, now I'm right outside the W
Wit' my shooter waitin' on you, hope you got another you
Ain't talkin' shit about what my lil' brother do
Or get your ass hit up in the club wit' a double deuce
Hustle Gang, give a damn what a sucker do
Doors up in the verte Lamb howlin', "Fuck a roof"
Pistol on me even though ain't finna bust it
You could sure use some shit, I give a bitch a thousand bucks

[Hook: B.o.B.]
If I don't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
I was fuckin' her friend, now I'm fuckin' her now
If I don't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
If you was my nigga then, then I fuck wit' you now
I fuck wit' you now

[Verse 3: Spodee]
If I don't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
She say she got a man, that's one thing
You don't spoke then, givin' a fuckin' about
Look at this this bitch wit' them fat-ass hips
Goddamn, girl, you could put a truck in your mouth
Ho forgot about her nigga after playin' (-), a couple of rounds
She was feelin', touchin' me, first she was suckin' me down

[Verse 4: Yung Booke]
Brah, what's up wit' you?
You know damn well I don't really fuck wit' you
Got the lil' shooter, go to shootin' when he touches you
Fuck around, drop a bell on you
Take the plug, met 'em through
Kickin' (-) shit on my Margiela shoes
Higher than this god, I replace you
And my sister, she'll take you to fuckin' babysit her
Had your (-) money fittin' like a brave nigga

[Hook: B.o.B.]
If I don't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
I was fuckin' her friend, now I'm fuckin' her now
If I don't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
If you was my nigga then, then I fuck wit' you now
I fuck wit' you now

[Verse 5: Shad da God]
Margiela my mason and I need investigation
I don't fuck wit' twelve, though I'm bein' (-) racist
Diamonds in her white, don't hold the ticket in her (-)
'Fore they put a new owner permanent vacation
I don't fuck wit' you, who the fuck wished I would stop (-)
We got haters, cuh, we got our own President
She write her sweets on a drug, fuck your numbers

[Verse 6: Big Kuntry King]
I ain't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
You a snitchin'-ass nigga, I ain't fuck wit' you never
Say that's your bitch, I fuck the ho whenever
I knew all my friends ten years, (-)
Came up sellin' crack, bustin' that chopper
Pockets on double cheese, that's a damn Whopper
First thing, nigga, I don't fuck wit' no copper
Catch you boomin' in my trap, man, a nigga gonna drop

[Hook: B.o.B.]
If I don't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
I was fuckin' her friend, now I'm fuckin' her now
If I don't fuck wit' you then, I don't fuck wit' you now
