[Intro]
We got London On Da Track

[Hook: T.I.]
I can give it to your ass if you want that
Get a whole bag if you need that
Big pimpin', tryna bring Romey Rome back
In the Cadillac bumpin' Bobby Womack
Hey where the hoes at?
In the Cadillac bumpin' Bobby Womack
I can give it to your ass if you want that
In the Cadillac bumpin' Bobby Womack

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Cadillac banging that Bobby that Womack
Big B's on pictures, you know that's that Bodak
I'm with my whoadie, lil bitch oughta know that
I had a sign for the millions, no zodiac
Bend that bitch over like centers and quarterback (hike)
When we take it we don't give a quarter back
Turnt her up now her dad want his daughter back
Oh no, now you got to see the law for that
I want racks and features with bouquets
And my motor's loud as a parade
I got 20 chains on, I'm a slave
To the money, for free not today
My lil bitch pretty, Ricki no Lake
And she watch all my moves while I pace
I lost two of my chains yesterday
They say "how they look?" I say "The lake"
I'm a boss, ain't gon' tell her two times
If she know I'ma fuck, bae let's motherfuckin' go
I'm the truth in this booth and I run the A-Town and Miami
Sak pase the zoes
I'm the shit, tempers on the migos, no motherfuckin' crows
Pockets I stuffed like they motherfuckin' swole

[Hook: T.I.]
I can give it to your ass if you want that
Get a whole bag if you need that
Big pimpin', tryna bring Romey Rome back
In the Cadillac bumpin' Bobby Womack
Hey where the hoes at?
In the Cadillac bumpin' Bobby Womack
I can give it to your ass if you want that
In the Cadillac bumpin' Bobby Womack

[Verse 2: Big Kuntry King]
I used to ride Cadillacs
Now, I'm whippin' a Wraith up in Womack
Yep, right here is where ya hoe's at
These Backwoods bitch, can you roll that?
I ain't worried about no hater, see this extendo clips?
Yeah, all these bullets, they can hold that
Just me, my stick, and my whoadie
All of my bitches imported
Pimping for real, you know it
I count money faster than niggas can snort it
All these blue hunnids in my pocket, damn
Look like a crippin' young Blood
Nigga cross me
Call me Red Cross cause you know I draw blood
Pussy nigga need to know this the mafia
Have his dumb ass swimming with tilapia
Little boy, you need to stay in your place
Recognize a whole G, when he in your face
When I used to sell blow
Nigga said the shit so raw that they can't even feel they face
Every real nigga know I run the A
I got them young thugs thuggin' everyday

[Hook: T.I.]
I can give it to your ass if you want that
Get a whole bag if you need that
Big pimpin', tryna bring Romey Rome back
In the Cadillac bumpin' Bobby Womack
Hey where the hoes at?
In the Cadillac bumpin' Bobby Womack
I can give it to your ass if you want that
In the Cadillac bumpin' Bobby Womack
