[Verse 1: Big Kuntry King]
Don't tell me bout ya man girl cause baby I ain't tryna meet him
Thangs that I do in the street baby probably feed him
I can take you to another coast give you all your freedom
Look at yo pretty smile, don't ya like how I tease ya
Now tryna please ya dat wet wet
Put ya in a buck till dat juice box drip
You lick ya lips, I lick you between ya hips
I grab dem thighs grab dat ass like some vicegrips
This da Titanic now let me sink my ship
Hit ya from da back till ya damn disc slip
I make ya moan and moan till ya tooth chip
That ain't nothing I'm bout to make ya do back flips

[Chorus: Lloyd & Big Kuntry King]

[Verse 2: Big Kuntry King]
It's round 2, what yo mind goin' through?
We can't rest yet, got mo work to do
I'm tryna give ya something baby that you neva had
The type of love that make you wanna call me Dad
I do it all night, I ain't even in a hurry
Type of fuckin' that'll leave ya eyesight blurry
More than a host, I'm the waiter servin' you
You want more pipe even though it's hurtin' you
I feel like an animal when I'm rammin' you
Grab you by your ankles, kiss the rim now slammin' you
I painted this picture so I could punch it out the frame
The only way we goin' out baby is with a bang

[Bridge: Lloyd]
I wanna love you I love you I wanna love you girl
I wanna love you I love you I wanna love you girl
I wanna love you I love you I wanna love you girl
I wanna love you I love you I wanna love you girl
I been thinkin' to myself, I ain't never met woman, that was just so cool
From the way that you walk, the way that you talk, ain't met a girl like you
Shawty tell me what it is, tell me what the biz, I'm tryna get close to you
What it do, me and you, this is true, because
Aye, can I love you, the right way, the right way
Oh, I wanna love you the right way, the right way

[Chorus: Lloyd & Big Kuntry King]
I know ya searching for somebody that can love you the right way right way right way right way aye
I know ya searching for somebody that can love you the right way right way right way right way aye
Love, love, love, love, love
You need a man who can pipe you the right way lick you in ya tight place do it how ya like it
You need a man who can pipe you the right way lick you in ya tight place do it how ya like it love you the right way
