[Intro]
I had woke up one morning, cut the TV on and it was talkin' bout hip hop
What hip hop used to be and how it's out of breathe now
I'm like damn, we in a new year, hip hop still outta breathe?
So while I'm in the booth, ya know what I'm talmbout, and what ya'll grew up listenin' to, is not what we grew up listenin' to, down here, ya understand me?
I get angry sometime bruh I gotta cool down, I gotta close up the trap to get back on my mufuckin' P's and Q's

[Verse 1]
I gotta thank the Lord two times
One just for being here, the other everything wakin' up feelin' fresh air
I guess I'm lucky momma (momma) ain't dead or in jail
I forgot to thank my lawyer, gettin' me off of twenty years (I'm sorry)
It like a full time job not to kill nigga
Try me, I'll put them hours in to kill nigga
I don't play no games, I got too much to lose
I got the whole Georgia on my back, I gotta pull through
I put them bricks down, pick up the microphone
And like my city streets, I'm goin' through zones
You not helpin' if you hatin', need to get gone
And like a light switch I'm tryna keep the south on

[Hook]
I need to put the pots down for a minute
And clear all the dust on the counters in the kitchen
I don't need a pen or a pad, just a mic and a stand
If you thought it was dead, then the south is where it's at
I need to put the pots down for a minute
And clear all the dust on the counters in the kitchen
I don't need a pen or a pad, just a mic and a stand
If you thought it was dead, then the south is where it's at

[Verse 2]
I gotta keep on goin' (goin') I gotta keep on movin' (movin')
Like some boxing gloves (gloves) my lyrics keep on bruisin' (bow)
Any contender (contender) don't matter the gender (gender)
This ain't Bone Thugs (thugs) but no surrender (yes)
Wit the mobster flow (flow) it's made for gettin' dough (dough)
Niggas they think it's dope they ask me what it's hittin' fo'
They say hip hop is dead, well I say it like a chopper
They say threes ain't that way, why you think I'm gonna pop ya
The south you cannot stop us, on the low you tryna diss us
I hear you fuck niggas every time I hit yo town
Actin like its all love, when I touchdown (what they do)
Try to steal our slang, tryna steal our sound

[Hook]
I need to put the pots down for a minute
And clear all the dust on the counters in the kitchen
I don't need a pen or a pad, just a mic and a stand
If you thought it was dead, then the south is where it's at
I need to put the pots down for a minute
And clear all the dust on the counters in the kitchen
I don't need a pen or a pad, just a mic and a stand
If you thought it was dead, then the south is where it's at

[Verse 3]
They say there's a time for war and a time for laughs
I want what time came, I'm wit what time pass
They say down south all we do is make party music
Well through this song in this club you can die to it
While the drunkies zooted nigga we might just lose it
You ain't know that we in this bitch wit them toolies
Cause you see us ballin' livin' life like a movie
And I act a fool so don't try me dude
Cause we do the motorcycle don't make us Tom Cruise
But like Tom Cruise I'm Mr. Mission Impossible
I can be rude and grab that chopper knock the block off you
But I'm being sensible, simply tryna talk to you

[Hook]
I need to put the pots down for a minute
And clear all the dust on the counters in the kitchen
I don't need a pen or a pad, just a mic and a stand
If you thought it was dead, then the south is where it's at
I need to put the pots down for a minute
And clear all the dust on the counters in the kitchen
I don't need a pen or a pad, just a mic and a stand
If you thought it was dead, then the south is where it's at
