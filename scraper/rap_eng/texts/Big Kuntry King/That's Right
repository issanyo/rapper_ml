Me and my partner poppin' bottles, throwin' money in the air
It's a party over here nobody care who over there
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right
Yeah that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right

[Verse 1: Big Kuntry King]
I'm on the cover of a magazine, ain't even got a album out
Mob at the streets my delete call my hits out
Now i'm the one everybody wanna talk about
Hustle hard, ball harder, that's what I be's about
Trap it out pimpin' better never leave yo white around
I'm the type of nigga break the whole state Alaska down
Now since I'm rappin' all these rappers wanna come around
They stick they hand out but them suckas get no pound
All of a sudden they into me, (huh) they some groupies G
They used to look at the chain and ask me where is T.I.P.,
Now they realize that Kuntry King the man in the streets
It's real mayne cocaine, yeah they finally get it G

[Hook: T.I.]
Me and my partner poppin' bottles, throwin' money in the air

[Verse 2: Big Kuntry King]
I got Oprah from the 80s wrapped up in rubber bands
Party like a rockstar, but this ain't a rock band
Throwin' money in the club changing up precipitation
If you gettin' rained on then you ain't participatin'
I bet that struck a nerve yes that's why them niggas hatin'
Prolly thought I'd never make it that's what they get fo' thinkin'
While they fakin' it I'm sayin' it, something for the soft
Butta chop pretty face and her ass very soft
Bet twats and lips make a nigga wanna tear her head off
Bet you wanna switch places like the movie face off
And I'm takin' off while all ya niggas fallin' off
You used to be the shit but when that ever counted dawg

[Hook: T.I.]
Me and my partner poppin' bottles, throwin' money in the air
It's a party over here nobody care who over there
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right
Yeah that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right
If you don't want no trouble better get back from me
I was trained as a youngin' go and get that money
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right
Yeah that's right, that's right, that's right, got that right

[Verse 3: Big Kuntry King]
I'm the voice of the street when I speak niggas listen
You can talk street shit but pimpin' never in it
You don't know about the courtrooms or another hearin'
Snitches ain't snitchin' cause they life they be fearin'
Through the lyrics you can hear it, I spit it how I live it
Gettin' to the money by the bundle how I spend it
All my cars tinted but they know whose in it
Same cool dude on the mic givin' you the bidness
The race ain't over but half you niggas finished
While I'm goin' to the Grammy's tryna see where I'm sittin'
Kuntry King in the buildin', I was just lettin' ya know
If your the one famous why they ain't let you through the do'

[Hook: T.I.]
Me and my partner poppin' bottles, throwin' money in the air
It's a party over here nobody care who over there
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right
Yeah that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right
If you don't want no trouble better get back from me
I was trained as a youngin' go and get that money
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right
Yeah that's right, that's right, that's right, got that right
