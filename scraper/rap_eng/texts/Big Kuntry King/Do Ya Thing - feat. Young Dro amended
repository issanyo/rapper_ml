[Intro: T.I.] x2
Aye, aye, aye, do ya thang
Aye, do ya thang
Aye, do ya thang
Aye, aye, do ya thang
Aye, aye, aye

[Verse 1: Mac Boney]
Fresh out the house, got the beat on suicide
As I ride up and down Martin Luther King Drive (Do ya thang)
Standin' tall, lookin' down on the bloody boys
Snitchin' all day, I look around on the block

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm in a silver SL, five pound on the block
Ain't cha ever seen a young player clown on the drop? (Do ya thang)
Ain't nuttin' to a G, gang spit fluently
Groups of hoes pursuin' me as if there's nothin' more than two of me

[Verse 3: Young Dro]
Monday, my Chevy's orange, and Tuesday is ocean blue
28's sittin' over you, Ferrari drops and Rovers too
Hoes, sit 'em out. TV's, I'ma flip 'em out
50 bricks, they ain't shit, tell 'em niggas, shift 'em out

[Verse 4: C-Rod]
I'm comin' down, shinin' rose gold, feelin' like a mag poles
Cadillac with five hoes, make these suckas hate mo' (Do ya thang)
Damn right, pimp, we do this every night
With the same big faces, make the lame hoes bite

[Chorus: Young Dro and T.I.] x2
I got that top down (Got that top down)
I got dem tint now (Got dem tint now)
I got the real rims (Real rims)
I'm worth some blocks now (I'm worth some blocks now)
Aye, do ya thang (I'm doin' it)
Aye, do ya thang (I'm doin' it)
Aye, do ya thang (I'm doin' it)
Aye, do ya thang (I'm doin' it)

[Verse 5: T.I.]
I'm in the hood in a drop top Super Sport, mesh leather horses, holla
And the Porsche is fallin' niggas on their Porsches, holla (Do ya thang)
They call me Thunder Bill, cut me down to somethin' else
Shawty, somethin' else, hot enough to make the suckas melt

[Verse 6: Young Dro]
I've got a scoop hood Chevy, followin' me, no 24's
Look at your Cutlass, green, diamond, purple hearts, bro (Do ya thang)
James Bond's car, drizzled as a pornstar
Spring, we was green, so my Cutlass is an orange car

[Verse 7: Mac Boney]
I got a curly hair, dirty red broad eatin' Lemonheads
Leanin' in the Lincoln with a pump by her left leg (Do ya thang)
Lookin' in the tan and getcha left side
Leave ya laid out and lay, do it by the lake, bitch

[Verse 8: Big Kuntry King]
Color coated rims, chop the streets till they rock up
Muscle cars straight buckin', look how it stands up (Do ya thang)
Yeah, I'm in the ride, look like a fruit drink
It makes these hoes thirsty when they see the pineapple paint

[Chorus: Young Dro and T.I.] x2
I got that top down (Got that top down)
I got dem tint now (Got dem tint now)
I got the real rims (Real rims)
I'm worth some blocks now (I'm worth some blocks now)
Aye, do ya thang (I'm doin' it)
Aye, do ya thang (I'm doin' it)
Aye, do ya thang (I'm doin' it)
Aye, do ya thang (I'm doin' it)

[Verse 9: Young Dro]
Baby, let green drop coupes that cream
Bling earrings in my ear look like a baby flat screen (Do ya thang)
I'm doin' it, my neck piece green
Ice rubberliscous perk
I'm a Grand Hustle King

[Verse 10: A.K.]
Yeah, super clean is on the scene
Italian leather match the Polo boots
And the wood grain lame, I'll show you how to do the do (Do ya thang)
Blowin' fruits, same flavor as the candy gloss
In the backseat, got a freak pullin' her panties off

[Verse 11: Mac Boney]
Err, weigh the anchor on the Cuban link chain
Diamonds stacked on top of diamonds, custom made pinky ring (Do ya thang)
Fishin' hats, Polo shorts with the Polo man
Wearin' blue and tan in the blue and tan Avalanche

[Verse 12: T.I.]
Jackers never had a chance, sell 'em in the Avalanche
They hopped out the van and started shootin' like a cameraman (Do ya thang)
Top down, hit the switch and let it drop down
Passin' by the underground, they can hear me underground

[Chorus: Young Dro and T.I.] x2
I got that top down (Got that top down)
I got dem tint now (Got dem tint now)
I got the real rims (Real rims)
I'm worth some blocks now (I'm worth some blocks now)
Aye, do ya thang (I'm doin' it)
Aye, do ya thang (I'm doin' it)
Aye, do ya thang (I'm doin' it)
Aye, do ya thang (I'm doin' it)

[Outro: Mac Boney]
Do ya thang...
Do ya thang...
