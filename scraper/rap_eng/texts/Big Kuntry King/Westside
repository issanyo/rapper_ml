The master of this trap shit, fifty keys in the crib hundred G's on a flat bitch
Fuck around with the right clique, we'll put ya down wit a lick for some white shit
Move on the nightshift, move when I say hold the tool with a tight grip
Nigga say he ain't like Tip, so I shot him in the foot that let him know we run a tight shift
We might flag but we don't flip, keep the money comin' in with a nice split

On the south we really buckin', on the south we really bustin'

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I'm talkin' Bankhead, Simpson Road, make bread flippin' O's

We ain't scared, ain't dead, we still pimpin' hoes
Shhh keep it on the low, murder cases don't mention those
Just know that my combustion spontaneous nigga no conversation I don't deal with miscellaneous niggas
How many times must I explain to you niggas, I bring the pain to you niggas
P down for pistol play I ain't a beginner

[Verse 4: Big Kuntry King]
I'ma westside nigga get it in now they call, why you hustle out there? Cause these J's have jobs
I know everything bout the blow, boy don't make me start
Made a million dollar trap movin' million dollar hard
You can catch me in Center Hill, Simpson Road, Bowen Homes or Bankhead Court
Hangin' with some young niggas, strapped, zooted, ready to go
For them Chips Ahoy nigga put one through ya fucking hole
Ya momma too, this the westside nigga you ain't know?
Get down or lay down, westside motto, AKs and grenades, strapped with some calicoes
Jumpin' out the four do' stretched out Benzo
Gangstas still run the city, like them damn diablos
Them niggas in the club yeah they spend a lot of money, but they brown and they soft, ain't good here honey
Them traps'll lockdown like Danny Boy was out, Mr. Mr. Westside now you know what I'm bout
