[Hook: B.o.B]
We got 'em going down for the count, looking down at the ground
That's why we got Haters, that's why we got haters
Haters everywhere go, Haters everywhere go
Haters everywhere go, where we go
Haters going down for the count (One!)
Looking at the ground (Two!)
I think you're a hater, I think you're a hater
Haters everywhere go, haters everywhere we go
Haters everywhere go, where we go
Haters going down for the count

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Jeahh.. yes sir it's the beats from Decatur (Jeah)
Can't see enemies and the haters (Jeah)
Little sharp like a thing like the razor (Jeah)
Blade, come clean like a shape up (Aha)
So I guess I gotta game my tape up (uh-huh)
But everybody got the need to say something (uh-huh)
Can't speak up whenever you face them (uh-huh)
That's what you call microphone gangsters (What's up?)
Yeah I got them, [?] dope (Dope)
Yeah I'm raw, you know my flow (flow)
Cause Bobby acting extra hard, like a viagra overdose (aha)
Talking that noise on all them songs (songs)
A bunch of little boys, but you all look grown (grown)
Those niggas there, and these niggas here
But it really doesn't matter, cause they all just clones (clones)
Go to school, read a book, be a lawyer (lawyer)
Hell yeah, man I'm all for the cause (cause)
And they ain't trying to involved with the law serve
But a nigga will get caught with the most money
And that just ain't a threat on a song (no)
Don't get it wrong, for protecting my own (no)
Cause niggas that slip, they don't last long (no)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Ross.. Haters talk, but they don't count
[Bet you got you a bird, nigga still at an ounce?]
[Bet you got you a house?], haters hating on me
'Cause I'm OG, big boss of the south
Got more diamonds, got more whips
Do more shining, stack more chips
I'm just riding, straight profiling
Yeah I'm smiling, with your bitch
VIP, don't touch my shit
Day with me, yeah that's my clit
Shake them haters, watch me stunt
Now all at once, suck my dick!
They know what we came for, AK to your [cango?]
They got me under investigations, they say I slang dope (Heeyy)

[Bridge]
We got 'em going down for the count

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
Boss! Talk about you, when I roll away
When around me, you ain't even got a word to say
And you was telling your folks, you were going to murder me
Kept me going to the car, ready hurry to play
Y'all looking at a man, I'm looking at children
Bored like a motherfucker, what is you doing
New Orleans, my city long been burnt
Watch yourself, your coming down your turn
You know what it is, you been down that path
In the shit, that these clowns don't have
Like buying a [boy/bar?] and putting it on my tab
Hate around on me, even on my staff
You a momma's boy, nigga you ain't so rough
Back in the hood, you didn't have no nuts
Me and my people used to beat you up
Now you on top and [thank you too much?]
(They hating)

[Bridge]

Behind my back you mad at me (strange)
In my face you proud of me (What?)

Niggas scared (niggas scared!)
'Cause I got that hater stopper (stopper)
