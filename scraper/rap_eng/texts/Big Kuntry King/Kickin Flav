I'm poppin' fly, I'm gettin' paid, I'm ridin' high, I'm kickin flav
All they do is get mad, all I do is get paid
All they do is talk shit, all I do is kick flav
I'm kickin flav, I'm kickin flav
I'm riding high, I'm getting paid
Kickin flav my shit major they hate on ?
I'm getting paid now I'm kickin flav
Getting paid now I'm kickin flav

[Verse 1: Big Kuntry King]
When I'm kickin flav I'm kicking pimpin'
Just know I'm all bout all bitches
Got it poppin like them prescription
Rawer than any coke in the kitchen
Catch me in a foreign whip driving with precision
Can't make no money here unless you get permission
Hold the ? got that memo
Don't get smoked like my Endo
Only jerking work with my ?
No snitchin' no no valid info
Yeah this the Bread Box Cartel
I'm not talking LL when I rock the bells
Pussy niggas actin' hard just that they actin'
When the Chopper get the Rat-A-Tat-in'
Thats when niggas get to rattin'
Thats why I be like get off out my face
You know I rap the P$C nigga all day

[Hook: T.I.]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
My top down they raise up
Campaign so major, all about that paper
'cuz that broke shit just ain't us
Ain't got shit on my crew nigga
Twice the shit that these new nigga
Fuck we care about you nigga
For fun we used to go shoot nigga
So you got a lil' gun say you wanna ball
Soon as i got a lil' money say I want it all
Now the multimillionaire racked up
You need a couple deal to check catch up
Now every time you catch us we on point no cactus
We don't act tough we the hustle gang
Getting dough like no other gang
Ain't nothing changed still love the game
No time to play with these suckers man
Lame nigga pop shit think a nigga famous
But we just gettin' paid ? money kickin flav
