[Verse 1: Big Kuntry King]
She got ho tendencies
Plus she fucked the whole P$C
Gon' set it out pimpin'
Come on nigga keep it G
She got it from her momma
Oh yes she's a nasty freak
Plus she like 'em young like Boomerang's Lady Eloise
And ya girl swallows till her voice goes hoarse
She had all kinds of dick tangled up her spinal cord
The laws of physics couldn't explain how her legs behind her head
While she givin' head hangin' off the edge of the bed
Ya thought she had a milkshake the way her bang pop out her head
Pussy fat like Bone Crusher plus the ho ain't "Never Scared"
She licked all the dogs balls scratched all the pussycats
So she goes both ways, yeah she's a brainiac

[Hook]
If you got you a ho, I'll tell you what to do
Gon' set the ho out, I'll tell you what to do
If you got you a ho, I'll tell you what to do
Gon' set the ho out, I'll tell you what to do
If you got you a ho, I'll tell you what to do
Gon' set the ho out, I'll tell you what to do
Don't cuff her, set her out
Don't cuff her, set her out
If you got you a ho, I'll tell you what to do

[Verse 2: Mac Boney]
I'm Old School Boney, they call me Frank the Tank, frankfurter on the sausage boy, streakin' on that drank
I'm the one that get them panties off when they say ya can't
I don't feed a ho shit nothin' but dick and candy paint
I love it when they say they saints, bitch you must be from New Orleans
I'm from the ATL shawty that's what I said she out her jeans
Freaky, freaky wild things constitute for wettest dreams
A white mask and black cape tryin' to make these bitches scream
She nasty as a Luke record, mouth is a cum drain
She goin' up and down on that Jeezy do that damn thang
It don't really matter if you dig her or you dis her man
Do your boy a favor when you out don't kiss her man

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Any real pimp'll know
The kind of chick I'm lookin' fo'
Actresses in movies and the models in the video
Call me Deuce Bigalow, cold blooded gigolo
Give the ho the rod then tell her let my nigga go
Pussy pumper number one'll hit the club and pick a ho
Let her hit the dro then swing her by the liquor sto'
Feed her ho snacks, everything you get you get to go
We ain't on no date what we eatin' drinkin' sittin' fo'
Walkin' through the hotel me and five and six or mo'
Any ho'll tell you he a balla he ain't trickin' though
P$C around it's goin down you better get ya ho
Have her gettin' loose tongue kissin' on the patio
Well known groupie let her momma and her daddy know
First she yellin' give it to me then she yellin' daddy no
Man I feed her Oreos, you take this freak to Pappadeaux's
Me and C and Kuntry we be flip floppin' swappin' hoes
