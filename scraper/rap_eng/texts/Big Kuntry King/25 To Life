[Intro: Mac Boney]
It's got to be grand, nigga, it's got to be the hustle, nigga
It's got to be the muscle, nigga
Who else they gonna goddamn call to talk this shit, nigga?
You already know who run them goddamn bricks down
Fo' real nigga, all that flexin' ain't 'bout nothin', nigga
This Mac Boney, nigga, cocaine champion, nigga
Ya already know

[Chorus: Mac Boney]
I'm talkin' cocaine heaven, cocaine Chevy
A bad ass brick cookin' bitch named Betty
I'm talkin' dope game ready, pot game ready
Talkin' block game ready, Glock game ready

I'm talkin' cocaine heaven, cocaine Chevy
A bad ass brick cookin' bitch named Betty
I'm talkin' dope game ready, pot game ready
Talkin' block game ready, Glock game ready

[Verse 1: Mac Boney]
Get your pots out, I got some new dope for ya
They say the rap game dead, I got some hope for ya
Who said the work slow? I'll bring the boat for ya
A big ass rifle, two of your partners gotta tote for ya
Stay on that slime shit, the worm that the bird chase
Slidin' through the hole, call me clean get away
I'm real and it shows, nigga ain't another way
But sell these 30 O's, I'll die another day
My bitch stay on her toes, she send them bullets right away
I feel it in my soul, and I ain't sold a block today
I keep a bank roll, so I ain't gotta make a play
I take it to them hoes and let them niggas see my face
This is how it goes, this is pure this is oil based
This is what you owe, give me meat, keep the business straight
Eyeball a ounce, 10 grand I demonstrate
Take ya pound money, why you think they call me gutta Nate?

[Chorus: Mac Boney]
I'm talkin' cocaine heaven, cocaine Chevy
A bad ass brick cookin' bitch named Betty
I'm talkin' dope game ready, pot game ready
Talkin' block game ready, Glock game ready

I'm talkin' cocaine heaven, cocaine Chevy
A bad ass brick cookin' bitch named Betty
I'm talkin' dope game ready, pot game ready
Talkin' block game ready, Glock game ready

[Verse 2: Big Kuntry King]
Cocaine bought a nigga everything
That's why you can find me ridin' heavy, mayne
Choppa half down, put it in the microwave
Let my bitch do it, she'll hard a nic right away
Million dollar trap house, trap star, that be me
I control the streets, I could show you how to tame the beasts
And beat up the block like an 808 in the beat
I'm the heart and the soul when it comes to movin' D
Treat it like some pussy when you run it through a 100 ki's
Everything is digital, no more triple Beams
Class of '96, dope boys yeah, that's evidence
A bowl of battery acid, just to drain the evidence
Just in case a rookie cop run up in my residence
I'll tell the young prick go and stick yo hand in it
Naked hoes, Glocks, AK's, and a ski mask
It's Kuntry Kane, bottom line I'm out to get the cash

[Chorus: Mac Boney]
I'm talkin' cocaine heaven, cocaine Chevy
A bad ass brick cookin' bitch named Betty
I'm talkin' dope game ready, pot game ready
Talkin' block game ready, Glock game ready

I'm talkin' cocaine heaven, cocaine Chevy
A bad ass brick cookin' bitch named Betty
I'm talkin' dope game ready, pot game ready
Talkin' block game ready, Glock game ready

[Verse 3: AK]
I'm in the all white caravan, similar to the postal man
The Eagle on the side, except my Eagle in my lap man
I'm on the slab with all the plans of takin' over foreign lands
With plenty crack and plenty straps, how it feels to be the man
I cooked it up and put it down, served the heart to hook the town
Now everybody callin' me 'cause I supply the hardest rounds
So shop with me or lay ya down, I want it all 'cause I'm a hound
Break me off or take a loss or find your ass in lost and found

[Verse 4: C-Rod]
Praise the chop, raise the chop, I love breakin' down the dope
Put it in a bag make it look more than you paid for
Finally came up, rich drugs, big plugs
Spit hollow tip slugs and the trigger fit snug
Buy from me or kick dust 'cause the dope gon sell it self
And I'm good enough to play hard and invest the rest
Powder white, double S, yes, with the dual set
Aye, C-Rod make the game look like no sweat

[Chorus: Mac Boney]
I'm talkin' cocaine heaven, cocaine Chevy
A bad ass brick cookin' bitch named Betty
I'm talkin' dope game ready, pot game ready
Talkin' block game ready, Glock game ready

I'm talkin' cocaine heaven, cocaine Chevy
A bad ass brick cookin' bitch named Betty
I'm talkin' dope game ready, pot game ready
Talkin' block game ready, Glock game ready
