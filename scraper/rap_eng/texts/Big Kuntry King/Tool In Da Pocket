[Intro]
Yeah, come on, come on
You know who this is mane, Big Kuntry King

[Verse 1]
I got them young jets with me spittin' lingo wit they fingas
If you try to gladiate us homeboy they'll kill ya
When the flags go up, you don't wanna stand up
You can try it homeboy but you don't want it with us
In the club drunk as fuck, wit them toolies on our hip
Steady rockin' to the beat, act a fool in this bitch
Yeah you be the one famous, but I be the one whose rich
Yeah my pockets got the mumps, Ion need a cure for it
If you hate it got killed for that, stomp you out like a welcome mat
Now you not welcome back, a gangsta here, welcome that
Look at that, the whole city got my back, why's that?
They say I'm the one that flood the trap
Say them Grand Hustle boys keep making that music
Cocaine (cocaine) nah I can't lose it, see my swagger all leather
That's why your girl keep choosin', nothin' better than the best
So ya'll niggas don't confuse it

[Hook]
Yeah I'm in the club rockin', tool in my pocket
Unleash your girl cause you know that bitch jockin'
Yeah I'm in the streets, yeah I keep it poppin'
Why my pants saggin' well I keep it hood partner
Yeah I'm in the club rockin', tool in my pocket
Unleash your girl cause you know that bitch jockin'
Yeah I'm in the streets, yeah I keep it poppin'
Why my pants saggin' cause I keep it hood patna

[Verse 2]
If I'm talkin' shit to you ain't no apologies to it
If I bust yo head that means I meant to do it
I ain't a sorry nigga so, what I got be sorry bout
Grab that chopper off the shelf and let them bullets hollow out
Watch yo mouth pimpin' cause that beef around the corner
Got the goons on deck they ready to place a order
I'd rather be making money movin' that yola
Go to Texas holla at my Oye on the border
Hold up, see, I'm too cool for ya'll niggas
See me in the club make it move my nigga
Even by myself I got that tool my nigga
Even my bitch hate is watchin' ya'll niggas
Nigga like a mount we poppin' them bottles

Ya'll gettin' booed, ya'll not even on Apollo
While we goin' ham while you suckas try to follow

[Hook]
Yeah I'm in the club rockin', tool in my pocket
Unleash your girl cause you know that bitch jockin'
Yeah I'm in the streets, yeah I keep it poppin'
Why my pants saggin' well I keep it hood partner
Yeah I'm in the club rockin', tool in my pocket
Unleash your girl cause you know that bitch jockin'
Yeah I'm in the streets, yeah I keep it poppin'
Why my pants saggin' cause I keep it hood patna
