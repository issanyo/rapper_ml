[Intro T.I.]
24's homie
Grand Hustle pimp. Hypnotize Minds
Let's go!
It ain't over, pimp, y'all already know who it is homie
Rubberband man!
Triple Six let's remix this thang
Juicy what it is pimp?
Yo, DJ Paul what's hannin'?
Crunchy Black, Infamous, what it is, homie?
I know my folk mane, keep it pimpin' in Memphis
Ya' understand me?
A-Town
Westside Bankhead

[Juicy J]
I'm ridin' my 24's, runnin' from the police
Got about a juice, but I sniff as I'm purple weed
But this nothing, I bring the shit to keep the smelling good
Man it's just stanky stanky weed from my neighbourhood
On the streets of Memphis we bumpin'
If you need something, call my cell phone
[?]
[?] for the charges, dope sellin', robbin'
And I can't go back to jail
But my trauma [?]

[DJ Paul]
Kick in the door
I'm makin foes hit the floor, so keys up
[?] 24's all with 23's
Memphis, Tenn and ATL
Fit like rims and tires
[?] barbeques and ties
Out in sky, listen to my pipes
Cuz I be pimpin' grand, smoking light, all night
I'm fresh about the trap
Till [?] got my cap, I [car breaking noise]
[?] bout to deal with five caps, shawty

[Hook x2]
Money, ho, cars and clothes
Thats how all my niggas know
Blowin' dro' on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll

[Big Kuntry King]
I got hundreds, the rubberband banks
Phew, sure bitch, I give a fuck what you think?
That's why I'm with my partna's
Rolling purple stank
We in Memphis city
Worth the sweet, [?] gettin' paid
And our Chevy's standin' tall
The spinners still spinnin'
The bar have the bitches
They gon' hide, fallin' pimpin'
They fallin' out their heels
On the ground, still grinin'
Larger than light, thats how a nigga livin'
Pimpin' get with it
Man it's always been a dream
Told my mama 'bout my business
And my fresh white tee
And shorts that leanin'
And we fuckin' plenty women
And women that kissin' women
Fuckin and lickin' each other, it goes down pimpin'!

[Hook x2]


[T.I.]
Here we go shawty
Spent 80 on the (sub)burban, 24's standin' tall
Im ridin', drinkin', swerving
Still slangin', serving raw
In the heart to the left
I ain't chasin' them broads
[?] clean, ride clean
No face, no flaws
In the club every nigga on the parking lot posted
They wanna holler West, just call
Yes y'all on the song lets ball
Remix, Triple Six, Juiceman, DJ Paul (Crunchy Black, c'mon nigga!)
Holla at my nigga MJG and Ball, Bun B
Yes Jeezy, Slim Thug, Paul Wall
C'mon Pimp stay property blockin'
And y'all [?] Project Pat, behind the walls
On the map Atlanta got [?]
They show love, so show love back
[?] in the trap, never eager your rap
Over 50K sold the first day, it's a wrap
This ain't the game, this the trap

[Hook x2]
