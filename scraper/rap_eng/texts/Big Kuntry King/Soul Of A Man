[Intro: Ricco Barrino]
Yeaaaahhh, ooowee, Puerta Ricc, Kuntry King
Oooohh, this is all I am, this is all I am

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
This is all that I am, the soul of a man
In these streets and they keep callin' me
And I can't change who I am, I just do what I can
In these streets but they won't get the best of me

[Verse 1: Big Kuntry King]
I wake up every morning gotta stash some rubberbands in that
Look at my city like one day I'm gon be runnin' that
Runnin' through the traps, one day I'm gonna run from that
Cookin' up this crack, takin' everything that come from that
Where the love is at, homeboy love don't live here
When our patnas dead and gone, we let the liquor shed tears
Keep my face dry as dirt, watch out for the copper
Wanna dick up in a dirt, nigga we some young blocksters
Like a locker, yeah, that's how we lock down the trap
Not realizin' that, we the only ones trapped
Where the combination at, I'm tryna break free from that
Got too many mouths to feed, shit I can't turn my back
Now that I'm seein' that my life is out of focus
And I couldn't see that, wit my eyes wide open
A hard nigga trippin' offa purp that he smokin'
My addiction to the fast life is higher than the dope is nigga

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
This is all that I am, the soul of a man
In these streets and they keep callin' me
And I can't change who I am, I just do what I can
In these streets but they won't get the best of me

[Verse 2: Big Kuntry King]
I'm in the rap game now, I'm the center of attention
Snatchin' pillows from these niggas, just to make these niggas listen
Prolly fiction, no time to sellin' all this fiction
Feel that friction, when my eyes get to twitchin'
When it comes to the beef, that when my finger get's to itchin'
Haters hide behind smiles, they don't really want the issue
Temperature on the thermometer, show you I'm the sickest
I stuck to my fans like a sticker, they hands up like a sticker
They love a real nigga, my songs on they way and they keep gettin' bigger
And I don't give a damn what nigga say he sicker
Nigga you can be reignin' but pimpin' I'm off the meter
I'm headed to the top so see ya
I'm holdin' on to the game like some C cups
Cause you lookin' don't mean you can see us
See me, feel me, more than a hit song
I'm goin ham in this bitch until I'm dead and gone yeah

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
This is all that I am, the soul of a man
In these streets and they keep callin' me
And I can't change who I am, I just do what I can
In these streets but they won't get the best of me

[Verse 3]
I raise trouble by the drugs, wish it was sunny side up
Wishin' one day that the sun come and shine on us
Feel my soul boilin' out the bottom of the pot
On my block tryna make my mark
Get lined in chalk, seem like that's where we end up
How we gonna do right, when we don't know which way is up
Why ya'll tryna be tough, tough is what I'm being
When it comes to the streets, that's how my heart beating
And when it comes to jail, I can take that beating
And not one of ya'll can fill the shoes that I be in
And ya'll really can't feel the shit that I go through
Unless you niggas really goin' through the shit too
Real recognize real that's why I feel you
Why they feel me? I'm the realest that they close to
Life is like a jump shot you gotta follow through
Even if the curtains close, I will still shine through nigga

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
This is all that I am, the soul of a man
In these streets and they keep callin' me
And I can't change who I am, I just do what I can
In these streets but they won't get the best of me

[Outro: Ricco Barrino]
Big Kuntry King, just get money man
Just doin' ya thang, that's the name of the game
Hey, Big Kuntry King, just get money man
Just doin' ya thang, that's the name of the game
Big Kuntry King
