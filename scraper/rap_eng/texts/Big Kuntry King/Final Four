[Verse: Big Country King]
I was raised in the dirty south, ain't nobody hot as me
Comin in a major leeg, look out for the PSE
With Mack, to the back, Imma put the Gat
To your head, catch you slippin, feel it, Imma put it to your back
I ain't just goin laugh to ya, Imma put this Gat to ya
Back speadin through the ghetto, k
50 in the projects chillin, posted up behind your building
Posted up, while I'm spillin
Most of us, just back here dealing
Crack and all, snatch it all
Might hit the club, straight bag it all
To a waterball, might want it all
Hit the hall, fight them cops
On the porch, slangin dice, flashin lights
To the parking lot, flashin lights
If you speak here, we goin fight tonight
Goin drank tonight, goin smoke tonight
Got the biz right, and I'm feelin right
I'm ridin rite, and my blunt is tight
Hit up Quay, and now this shit rite
Fuck with me, boy, save your life
