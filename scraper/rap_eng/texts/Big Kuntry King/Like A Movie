[Intro: Lloyd]
I live my life like a movie

[Chorus: Lloyd]
You know I keep the heat by my side
Hoppin' out the flyest rides
So I live my life like a movie
And you know
Always check in with the finest hoes
Always in the flyest clothes
So, I live my life like a movie
I live my life like a movie

[Verse 1: Big Kuntry King]
They call me Young Nino, from New Jack City
Cause the OGs say they see that type of gangsta in me
Plus I used to move cola, they knew I had plenty
Always had a lot of hoes fightin' just to get near me
Walk in the club, is that my name I'm hearin'
DJ scratch the record, Big Kuntry King in the buildin'
Before you knew it, rubberband banks I'm spendin'
If it ain't XO, then it really not Remy
Strong in my natural ballin', yeah I'm sippin'
All purpled up, so it's rainin' all in me
Never mind all the star chicks I'm fuckin' for the night
So what you suckas know how my life be like

[Chorus: Lloyd]
You know I keep the heat by my side
Hoppin' out the flyest rides
So I live my life like a movie
And you know
Always check in with the finest hoes
Always in the flyest clothes
So, I live my life like a movie
I live my life like a movie

[Verse 2: MacBoney]
I live my life like a movie Al Pacino or some shit
Walkin' out the restaurant just another gangsta flick
I got my pretty girl at home you know I keep my gangsta chick
The one who roll the blunt, who drive the car, she handle little shit
If I get into some shit, she know to call the clique or make a trip
And if its ever pistol play to pull the Glock and let it rip
Flyin' down the strip, everything is like the big screen
A couple big screens in the car, you ain't neva seen 007, Mack 11 in the headrest
A 9 camera module in the room where the bed rest
Full walk in closet and a gun with a man dress
Do you wanna play the part, all you gotta say is yes

[Chorus: Lloyd]
You know I keep the heat by my side
Hoppin' out the flyest rides
So I live my life like a movie
And you know
Always check in with the finest hoes
Always in the flyest clothes
So, I live my life like a movie
I live my life like a movie

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Lights, camera, action nigga
You can go from Boyz N The Hood to Menace To Society
Ain't gon find a rapper out the hood quite as fly as me
No matter how official other niggas try to be
It's lights, camera, action when I'm flashin' hoppin' out the V
Fresh top to bottom, in the flyest fashions gotta be
A documentary, cause ain't gon get' no actin' out of me
A 44 and several molly hoes on the side of me
Along with a clique of headbustas that'll die for me
Juice like Bishop what the fuck I care about a beef
Scream all you wanna, real niggas move silently
The Godfather trilogy and Goodfellas inside of me
Whether a happy ending or they close my curtains violently

[Chorus: Lloyd]
You know I keep the heat by my side
Hoppin' out the flyest rides
So I live my life like a movie
And you know
Always check in with the finest hoes
Always in the flyest clothes
So, I live my life like a movie
I live my life like a movie

You know I keep the heat by my side
Hoppin' out the flyest rides
So I live my life like a movie
And you know
Always check in with the finest hoes
Always in the flyest clothes
So, I live my life like a movie
I live my life like a movie
