[Intro: Big Kuntry King]
You know who this is mayne
Big Kuntry King
Uh c'mon
Ay girl, ay girl, ay girl

[Hook: Trey Songz & Big Kuntry King]
Girl, your ass is just the fattest
If I can I wanna grab it
I'm the man and you can have this
What I'm saying is you a bad bitch, a bad bitch
Girl, your ass is the fattest
Can I touch it, can I touch it, can I touch it like this?
Can I cuff it, can I cuff it, can I cuff it like this?
Can I, can I, can I, can I
What I'm saying is you a bad bitch, a bad bitch
Girl, your ass is the fattest

[Verse 1: Big Kuntry King]
I'm in love with a stripper, T-Pain don't know the half
Got 10 stacks of 1's, let the ground do the math
Throwin' money in the club, let the rain wet her ass
Lookin' for a bad bitch, guess what, she just that
Hair jet black, a ass that's fat
She's the reason why every nigga in here keep runnin' back
And hoggin' all the dances tryna get that girl to roll
Everybody gotta invitation, open car door
She's a monster on that pole, slowly slidin' down
She can easily steal your soul bouncin' that ass all around
When she hit the floor hard tryna splash up a puddle
Wonder what's the next play like she callin' out a huddle
Like a shuttle, purp smoke got us all takin' off
And she look me in my eyes while she take her clothes off
Is it her makeup or her face that pretty?
Then she whisper in my ear to tell me she comin' with me

[Hook: Trey Songz & Big Kuntry King]
Girl, your ass is just the fattest
If I can I wanna grab it
I'm the man and you can have this
What I'm saying is you a bad bitch, a bad bitch
Girl, your ass is the fattest
Can I touch it, can I touch it, can I touch it like this?
Can I cuff it, can I cuff it, can I cuff it like this?
Can I, can I, can I, can I
What I'm saying is you a bad bitch, a bad bitch
Girl, your ass is the fattest

[Verse 2: Big Kuntry King]
Go to Body Tap or Strokers if you wanna see some ass and titties
If you want a diamond, you go to Magic City
Caramel skin, ass soft enough to sink in
All this money on the floor, baby, go head and sink in
Her lip gloss is poppin', that's why she always lick it
Pussy poppin' on the pole, make me wanna hit it
I watch them dollars fall on her like a waterfall
Oh yes she gonna flirt, until she get it all
She's the baddest bitch, somethin' like that girl Trina
I love to watch her get money when them girls team up
And them high heels give her ass the perfect fold
Yes she likes to pose, like she doin' a center fold
The center of attention,oh yeah she be the show
The simplest movement will leave your mind blown
You gotta love it though 'cause she gettin' dough
Everytime she see me, she got a place to go

[Hook: Trey Songz & Big Kuntry King]
Girl, your ass is just the fattest
If I can I wanna grab it

What I'm saying is you a bad bitch, a bad bitch
Girl, your ass is the fattest
Can I touch it, can I touch it, can I touch it like this?
Can I cuff it, can I cuff it, can I cuff it like this?
Can I, can I, can I, can I
What I'm saying is you a bad bitch, a bad bitch
Girl, your ass is the fattest
If I can I wanna grab it
I'm the man and you can have this
What I'm saying is you a bad bitch, a bad bitch
Girl, your ass is the fattest
If I can I would grab it
So tell me can I have it
What I'm saying is you a bad bitch, a bad bitch
Girl, your ass is the fattest
