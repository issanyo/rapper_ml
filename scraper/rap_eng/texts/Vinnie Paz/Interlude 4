Yo, yo, we back, once again. This some new shit we came up with. This was actually me and my partner Scott Stallone. We produced this record together, produced by Vinnie Paz and Scott Stallone. This Death Messiah 2012 featuring Johnny Cash. We hooked this shit up. We felt like it needed to be rhymed on. Rebirth something that was a little you know, a few couple years old. Enjoy this shit man. Fall back, smoke an L to this
