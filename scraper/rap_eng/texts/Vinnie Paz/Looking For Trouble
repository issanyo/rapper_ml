[Verse 1: Blaq Poet]

You looking for trouble?
You found it, I'm right here
Resevoir Dog nigga, cut off your right ear
Blaq Poet dope kid, you already know that
I'll cut you, head butt you
Can't fuck with this throwback
Lyrics too hard like motherfucking granite
Or gran-ITE feels like I'm not from this planet
Or maybe it's the Henny in me, I don't understand it
Fuck trying to figure it out I just slam it
Something's cooking, yo, who's looking for war
Who's looking for a broke jaw get laid on the floor
Straight warrior, battle with the warriors
Fuck what happened and fuck what the story is
If you really want it all you gotta do is test this
I'm reckless, you must have a motherfucking death wish

[Hook: Spit Gemz] (2x)

I pledge allegiance to destruction, I'm tyrannical
I am the apex, top tier animal
King of the jungle, I was meant to be royal
I'm from a broken home, I was raised on enemy soil

[Verse 2: Chino XL]

Big Chino goes hard in the paint
Getting love out in Boston like I'm a Boondock Saint
Wait, you think that I'm done when I ain't
I speak with a tongue full of hate
When I'm irate I pray for the lungs of Big Punisher the great
Give you an ass-whipping that's really just over fifteen minutes
The amount of hits that you will take to the face will be in triple digits
You looking for trouble? Come get it and get an eye missing
Every verse that I spitted is a special limited edition
My words and spiritual worlds a perfect marriage
Bringing you that scary footage without them stupid shaking cameras
Paranormal Activity raw with the depths of my depravity
These visions in my head got me walking the edge of insanity
I'm the nightmare that will easily wake up Tim Burton beastily
Never peacefully, there's curtains a surgeon carving you up evenly
The uncooked flesh that I eat wears prepared in demonic boil
Bile encapsulated in vials and mixed with cemetery soil
For artists with no need for Thesaurus to bring verbal horrors
And for the end I'm leaving you skinned like that movie Martyrs
It's proven of all rulers I'm the most ghoulish
Fuck who you and your crew is
I'll catch you on your cruise ship and decapitate you
And I'm using your skull as congas
My movement is an animal unleashed
When I preach my creature speech
It's utter madness, like cow disease
My haters can't excel our tasers [?] in hell
I'm sicker than a schizophrenic hermaphrodite raping itself
Fuck out of here

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]

You looking for trouble? You found it, I'm right here
I rip the track in fucking half, you just a slight tear
I run with rowdy motherfuckers who don't fight fair
Right there, stomp his fucking head in with the Nike Airs
I'm colder than polar motherfucker, the white bear
I'm from Philly it ain't that motherfucking nice here
The manifestation of holiness is right here
My fascination with loneliness in the night air
I think it's common knowledge, you don't wanna fuck with me
If I'm your bunkie, you wouldn't wanna be stuck with me
Pussy boy soaking wet like a buck fifty
John Rambo, take his fucking guts with me
Just waiting until this Goose and this fucking dust hits me
You ain't Aaron Fuchs, you ain't from a tough city
I was Killadelph, brothers Puff 'nough izzy
I throw a left right leave a sucker duck dizzy, stupid
