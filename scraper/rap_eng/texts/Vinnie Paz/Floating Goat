[Intro]
God of our father's hear me the wicked seek to rule the Earth and mock your will - show them your wrath!
Destroy the guilty lest the innocent perish

Yeah, Muggs: The Black Goat, Pazienza
Yeah, yeah
Raise the gates

[Verse 1]
This a headshot homie and I broke the balloon
They was plottin' that homie, it was smoke in the room
This is blacked-out everything, cold in the womb
This is three faces of fear, the dungeon of doom
See it's drugs here opium, Iranian gangs
The devil is long-horned, he like Damion James
How he talkin' hammers when he can't even hold a tool right
This .50 cal'll have 'em all sleeping like a school night
Listen, this gun is a small stalker
That make your body burst into flames like it's Paul Walker
Laser light bayonet, really it's the sharpest
From experience the first milli is the hardest
Death's coming soon pal, it's chilly in this darkness
The place that I'm from called Philly and it's heartless
It's game time, money, caught a body off the rip
Just another John Doe with his body in the ditch

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Cobra Kai, Daniel LaRusso
Fire at close range pal, Antetokounmpo
I been doing this, I got workers on the night shift
I was denied bail, judge said I was a flight risk
Still sharp as steel mahfucker, I'm a sharpener
Perry was a wanderer, [?] was a carpenter
Atilla the Hun, barbarian, a conqueror
[?] Babalawo [?] I'm a conjurer
All these scallywags carry leather sword sheaths
There's fertile soil there, unexplored heaths
This Mossberg like the god of thunder Thor speaks
A shooter work is never done until his gourd leaks
A dead man said he got his power from the tomb
I can tell you pussy, you the loudest in the room
I made one call, look at all the soldiers that came
It's a different era pussy but the code is the same
