[Intro]
(Laugh) Yeah, this is Vinnie Paz, Big Louie Dogs (yeah)
Odrama Vin Laden
Genocide
Yo Makhno, what'up cuzzo?
Classified intelligence motherfucker

[Verse 1: Genocide]
I remain in the dark cause I'm wanted by the government
I know about the heroin and coke that they smuggling
You wonder why the president don't care about the suffering
It's all about the money in a word that is crumbling
They got the economy hijacked like a robbery
You living in poverty, property with no commodity
Draconian colony bringing aware to the policy
Totalitarian, Trillionaires with a [?]
Our case symbology, [?] for the future
Get ready for the war like the streets of Fallujah
Junior Makhno and Genocide with a ruger
We gotta bring heat or be another Bill Cooper
Secure my perimeter, deliver my agenda
What you know about the government and false flag terror
From the USS Cole to the world trade center
We need to rise up for the freedom that we treasure

[Hook x2: Genocide]
Get up, get up and get ready to engage in combat
We more deadly than machete blades
Urban warfare generals, enemies of the state
Genocide and Vinnie Paz, we ain't scared to retaliate

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Obama's a fraud, every action is opposite god
Line 'em up guillotine, then chop with the sword
Anyone who got murked, then I was the cause
Who the one who got hurt and died on the cross
Not the Jesus that they told you that died
He escaped and he hid inside a hole and survived
Fuck the pope, he a Nazi and I hope that he die
I hope that none of y'all listen to his holiness lies, yeah
I hope that y'all never trap with the beast
I hope that y'all don't have to ever see the savage's teeth
They look for flesh and see a ravenous feast
I was beasting mothafuckers for they Lazarus piece, yeah
I told y'all about my son in a box
I told y'all never talk and to run from the cops
I told y'all 'bout the jums and the pots
The C.I.A. killed Kennedy and put the jums on the blocks

[Hook x2]

[Scratches]
Genocide, the freedom fighters that got the whole world terrified
Vinnie Paz, yeah
Bringing the truth to all of y'all
My shit is military, search and destroy
Here to scatter government, a state within a state is recovenent
They can burn this motherfucker down
This is taliban rap, raw rap
My shit is military

[Hook x2]
