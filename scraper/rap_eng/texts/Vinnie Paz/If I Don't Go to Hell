If I don't go to hell when I die I might go to heaven. x4
Might go to heaven, might go to heaven
But probably not...

If I don't go to hell when I die I might go to heaven. x10

(Verse 1: Pacewon)
If I don't go to heaven, there's nobody to blame
But me, I must be insane
See my parents tried to teach me to keep my life clean
But I was molded and built by the things that I've seen
I saw brothers in the hood eat good people for dinner
And I copy their evil ways like I'm usin' a printer
I've always been a sinner, think of myself a winner
A real live vet, but I'm still a beginner
It's just like a movie by Martin Scorsese
Where the lead character's arrogant as Jay-Z
Delirious, idiotic and crazy
Rambunctious, self-centered and lazy
Stingy, ego-centric and shady
And God sent his only son to save me?
So I kneel and pray to the most High
That I don't go to Hell when I die...

If I don't go to hell when I die I might go to heaven. x4

(Verse 2: Vinnie Paz)
Yeah..  Listen...

Where do you go when you die?
Do you feel it's somethin' else or do you know it's a lie?
Do you think I could believe that there's an ocean if I
Didn't think of somethin' bigger when I'm closin' my eye?
How they'res gon be a novel with no author?
How they'res gon be a child with no father?
What's the mechanism for you to defend honor?
What's the definition for you to withstand Karma?
Everybody dies, everybody doesn't live
Everybody doesn't have another body they can give
Everybody has a different idea of what it is
What it is, is the fact that you feedin' it to the kids
And I can't process I'm still livin' in the flesh
Was it heaven or another form of prison with Koresh?
And you strugglin' n' wonderin' how you livin' to the next
Are you comfortable knowin' that your existence is a guess??

Yeah

If I don't go to hell when I die I might go to heaven. x4
