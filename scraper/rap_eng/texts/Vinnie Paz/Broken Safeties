[Verse 1: Apathy]
I keep sub-woofers woofing like a werewolf, howling
The werewolf growling, rappers throw the towel in
I stand tall, towering
A giant, overpowering
Meet me outerspace where I'm meteor showering
Shoveling, dirt up in the cemetery
Scowling, crawling
Looking for a soul for devouring
Owls swoop down, grabbing rats off the ground
You can hear the bell toll twelve time's in the town
Now it's midnight, streets where them lost souls hitchhike
Hearts pump ice water, never been the bitch type
I fistfight with God, slap box with Amun-Ra
I'm Allah, I'm a star, armed robbing armored cars
Armor Alled Audi villain
I'm a getaway driver
Loaded automatic in my leather jacket liner
Rap is like vagina, eat it, beat it, till it bleeds
Fill it full of seeds, keep the kingdom under siege, hoes

[Verse 2: Lawrence Arnell]
I am surrounded by legends
Even when I don't fit in, I get in
You ain't gotta pat me down to find the weapon
Scott Stallone won't even adjust the settings
Before the Armageddon starts
The dark artists
I go the hardest, the farthest, after my target
So when I'm standing on a pyramid
Amongst the Army of the illest fucking lyricists
Chicken Little, be prepared for anything when the sky falls
You gon' have to fucking deal with it, all of y'all
My team's synonymous with fire pits
Branding irons, muzzle flash, crying kids
The catalyst, the arrogance, is brought upon
By the fact that nobody's ever proven me wrong
So fuck your song, fuck your albums and your rap career
You got a problem? I'll be right here

[Hook]
There's a war going on outside
You can either find a place to hide or start riding
Never the victim with my hands in the sky
When it's hammer time, racks'll slide
Leviathan
There's a war going on outside
You can either find a place to hide or start riding
Never the victim with my hands in the sky
When it's hammer time, racks'll slide
Leviathan

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, I'm here to reincrease the murder rate
Smoking wakata in Zanzibar
Listen to purple tape (Raekwon da Chef!)
I don't like the shit that y'all regurgitate
Rearrange your face into a state to make the nurse's shake
Young bull run up on you, take your purch' and break
Eating FesenjƒÅn with four maghzi off a Persian plate
I don't listen to the music that you herds create
Soft motherfuckers sound like you rehearse with Drake
(Y'all motherfuckers soft!)
It's wearing on me, I don't know how much my nerves can take
I guess being a bitch requires certain taste
I make the same incisions that a surgeon make
Two times too many, you don't get a third mistake
You ass betting so I know that you for certain snake
And I don't trust a motherfucker, I'm immersed in hate
Colombo crime family, fuck around and burst your face
Allahu Akbar, blocka blocka, burn his face

[Verse 4: Celph Titled]
Army of the murderers, mercenaries with no mercy
Soldiers that's so dirty, hold burners that hold thirty
Lock a corrupt officer in the corner with the ghost of Chris Dorner
And commence to piss on him (Think we won't?)
Your security; needs security
We damage 'em all, y'all building bird houses
Your hammers is small (why they so small?)
I put the nozzle in your nasal hole
You break 'em down to grams baby we bake 'em whole
You ain't a O.G., you're the first to G.O
Speed off in a Geo and duck like Nat Geo
Shoot through your book, there's holes in your story
My young bulls cracking skulls and they open 'em for me
Cut open three white keys with a white Continental GT key
For a three night spree out in Waikiki
And I repeat, when the iron start firing
You gon' hear my hollow spit bitch but I ain't Hawaiian
