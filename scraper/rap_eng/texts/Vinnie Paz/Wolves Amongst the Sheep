[Hook: Block McCloud]
We live by the assassin's creed committing dastardly deeds
Slash and you bleed, we live in the cut
It's like we have a fucking disease
A virus, violence begets violence, you're drowned in a river of blood
And all you bastards can plead for mercy and cry, you're buried alive
Nobody's digging you up
It's like we have a fucking disease
A virus, violence begets violence, you're drowned in a river of blood

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Weak niggas surviving with an IQ level low
My shit rock like 2Pac or Os on a ghetto stove
My flows will leave 'em weak, you see the rose petals blow
Gun smoke settles slow when I blow the cold metal nose
Like holding recelos, Bacardi and bezel glow
Dressed in dough, the boy covered in ice like an Eskimo
Lay one of you kids, I'm in child molester mode
Trying to follow his tracks I'll derail your train of thought
And afford you one female in the same assault
Stainless fork, flame the pork with a grain of salt
Vinnie Paz, semi mags, who want to claim to talk?
Address your shit like Jimmy Jazz, so put your frame in park
The black stallion, Italiano, gangsters walk
This arcane, we off the chain, the links'll talk
I get all in the bitch head like a shrink, of course
You half-steppin' and ass-bettin', the bank is off

[Hook: Block McCloud]
We live by the assassin's creed committing dastardly deeds
Slash and you bleed, we live in the cut
It's like we have a fucking disease
A virus, violence begets violence, you're drowned in a river of blood
And all you bastards can plead for mercy and cry, you're buried alive
Nobody's digging you up
It's like we have a fucking disease
A virus, violence begets violence, you're drowned in a river of blood

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
You tryna sell wolf tickets to the lion of the jungle
I'm the eyes of God, they call me cyanide in the struggle
You the kind of guys that would be traumatized in the scuffle
And I'm buying pies with the Italian guys with the muscle
I'm dying before I trust you, the iron inside the duffel
You on Rikers Island, I can get homicidal to touch you
Im inside, I'm viral, I'm the messiah's idol above you
I'm the pride of Cairo, I'm genocidal and I will cut you
I'm riding for all my hustlers and anybody building bridge
It's no mercy and Pazienza I will kill the kids
Blood diamonds, Sierra Leone is really big
The G36 slick, it'll peel your wig
If it ain't the 36, then I'll let the 9 explode
I knew about collapsing buildings before Osama knows
I create beef, Vinnie always finds a foe
Bitches up and down on my dick like I'm the Konami code

[Hook: Block McCloud]
We live by the assassin's creed committing dastardly deeds

A virus, violence begets violence, you're drowned in a river of blood
And all you bastards can plead for mercy and cry, you're buried alive
Nobody's digging you up
It's like we have a fucking disease
A virus, violence begets violence, you're drowned in a river of blood
You're drowned in a river of blood
