[Jus Allah]
The metal inside the barrel passes, through the frames in ya glasses
Quick passage, leave your dome piece backless
Envision blackness, leave you hatless, fucking capless
Watchin niggas dig the spot where the Earth's crack is
Hard to graph like science and math is
The cavemen who dont practice and live backwards
We oxing with streets is watchin, release shotguns
Niggas got Dietz and Watson
Feel no love, no way you shield the slugs
The ill thugs, we box with steel gloves
Doubt my faith, you can taste the slug case
Leaving niggas looking like dogs with the pug face
Even your girl can catch the capsule, I love pussy
But never the bitch that it's attached to

[Chorus x2: Vinnie Paz]
Why you wanna battle wit kids with steel tongues?
Who rip up mics and drink puerto-rock(rican) rum
85 (the 85%): face the truth, your too dumb
If retaliation comes yo then fuck it it just comes

[Vinnie Paz]
We itchin' to kill, thats why we spittin' the real
Stick to the drill and maybe we'll be grippin a mill'
The clip'll expel, dump 'em in a ditch or a hill
'Cuz the muthafucka ain't left me shit in his will
And y'all was always soundin' like a bitch when you spill
And we the rawest motherfucking clique in the field
So real muthafuckas better recognize real
Or ill muthafuckas gonna exercise skill
Y'all better chill when the Hologram build
Little muhfuckah got hands just like steel
Whoever approach me and what i feel
'might find their legs being replaced by steel'
So y'all better yield or I'ma choke faggots
My hands held more razorblades than coke addicts
We like to quote facists, 'cause we the meanest
And rip off your fingers with the pliers of Chakademus

[Chorus x2: Vinnie Paz]
Why you wanna battle wit kids with steel tongues?
Who rip up mics and drink puerto-rock(rican) rum
85 (the 85%): face the truth, your too dumb
If retaliation comes yo then fuck it it just comes

Yo yo yo yo yo yo jedi mind baby
Iledelph stand by, baby, naw I'm sayin? Ikon the Hologram
JusAllah, Jusallah
My man Chico, enemy of mankind......
