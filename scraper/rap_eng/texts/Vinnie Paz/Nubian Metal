[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
I'm straight jacking in a straight jacket, letting gats flare
My crib not the Player's Club but got plenty MACs there
Slip scripts like pill mills, we the real deal rapper slappers
Get a toe tag and black bag to match it
Took your girl but it's a'ight, she call me "papa bear"
Your studio makes bubble raps so we can get it popping there
When I'm an Hennessy fiend I like to flash that semi thing
And cook the biscuit like Jimmy Dean
Break in your house while you sleep, yeah this dude's scary
Put a pillow over your teeth like the Tooth Fairy
Now all I see is a flurry of feathers (What else?)
A dead motherfucker and a smoking Beretta
They say, "Celph wild, he be eating flesh"
But I don't ever die I'm a crash test dummy with GPS
Give a fuck if you a Folk or a Crip
The smoke stack from this bomber'll cause a solar eclipse

[Hook: Blacastan]
Nubian metal
Forever war beef never settle
Cock it back and let it bark like Pits in the kennel
There's no love here, only warfare
Letting heads roll, we never fought fair
"Lord have mercy"
Fuck outta here

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
You like Heaven, I like Hell
Y'all ain't got no bars you like a dead cell
I'm Seamus Ryan in '97, ya head swell
Round the whole entire Army up and set sail
I ain't know a human being could be that frail
That pussy and that suckerish, that stale
I ain't know it was wackness on such a vast scale
I ain't notice the tragicness of the rat's tail
I had to fight through adversity like a black male
I had to perform a surgery with the black nail
I can see the uncertainty through a black veil
I bleed blood that's burgundy, you's is pastel
(Some arts and crafts motherfuckers)
Hard rock, Vinnie crush boulders
I've been carrying y'all too long, hunched shoulders
Talking 'bout Crystal drinking crushed Foldgers
Iron Mike '87 god crush [?]

[Hook: Blacastan]
Nubian metal
Forever war beef never settle
Cock it back and let it bark like Pits in the kennel
There's no love here, only warfare
Letting heads roll, we never fought fair
"Lord have mercy"
Fuck outta here

[Verse 3: Blacastan]
My tools burst, plus the knife work
Wanted to hustle but I had to quit school first
I made rhyming my life, word to Kool Herc
[?] and threw ten right through your shirt
Run up in your crib, Rob the Base, that's EZ Rock
My disguise, long beard like the ZZ Top
Let the beat knock, feel it that's that 80s rock
Hit the block with a sock full of crazy rock
Moon craters, long guns remove haters
Cream joints rolling dust in a doobie paper
This that easy writer in a brown package
We rap lords, we rhyme masters
Leaving niggas laid out like Craftmatics
We acknowledge the knowledge god, that's mathematics
You can add on or you can build on it
If you love your script you can get killed on it
I leave bodies where I live like Gacey's crib
Crime fiend like the lake where Jason live
Horrifying make you convert like Ma$e done did
Making rappers cross over like Jason Kidd
