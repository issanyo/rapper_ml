[Intro: Clip from Network]

I want you to get mad! I don't want you to protest, I don't want you to riot, I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime on the street. All I know is that first you've got to get mad! You've got to say, "I'm a human being, goddamnit! My life has value!"

[Intro

Start the uprising
We'll start the uprising
It's time to uprise
It's time to uprise

[Verse 1 - Block McCloud:]
Listen people they got us believing we're nothing
But heathens screaming hating each other for nothing but breathing
Hating each other for colour and creed when me and you
We one and the same under the blade you cut and you bleed
And they think we dumb and naive
But we wasn't conceived yesterday
We know that AIDS they made up the disease
And they tease us with money and greed and make us hunger and feed
Off each other like some blood-sucking freaks
And the most ignorant nigga's a publisher's dream
Nothing but whores and infidelity is up on the screen
Real chance of love with a slut and a creep
A lover that cheats, these dumb broads should be running the streets
If you think that letting your daughters watching Charm School
Won't harm you or her in the long run you're a darn fool
It's so blatant how they raping our minds
In plain sight taking our rights, dignity, it ain't right

[Hook]
Let's start the uprising
It's time to cut ties with these fucking guys that's feeding us nothing but lies
It's time to uprise
Rise up time's up
Cause when the trust dies, love dies like government spies

Let's start the uprising
It's time to cut ties with these fucking guys that's feeding us nothing but lies
It's time to uprise
Rise up time's up
Cause when the trust dies, love dies like government spies

[Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz:]
I'll admit that Obama had me believing the hype
But after doing the knowledge I ain't been sleeping at night
Probably the biggest deception I ever seen in my life
If y'all don't read between the lines then y'all ain't reading it right
Yeah Vinnie Paz just a motherfucking trooper stepping
Nuclear anxiety and the cold of the super weapon
Obama and Bush cousins and that's a true connection
Seizing power and property like a ruthless henchman
I'm in the Jewish temple on Mount Zion
Studying literature from the Priory of Sion
Nothing's safe, no cars, no planes to fly on
I got a few bulletproof vests to try on
Yeah but y'all can just remain the machine
It's true lies but I decide to stay on my deen
You a sucker if you think that the economy kill
Barack Obama 666 finally revealed

[Hook]
Let's start the uprising
It's time to cut ties with these fucking guys that's feeding us nothing but lies
It's time to uprise
Rise up time's up
Cause when the trust dies, love dies like government spies
Let's start the uprising

It's time to cut ties with these fucking guys that's feeding us nothing but lies
It's time to uprise
Rise up time's up
Cause when the trust dies, love dies like government spies

Let's start the uprising
It's time to cut ties with these fucking guys that's feeding us nothing but lies
It's time to uprise
Rise up time's up
Cause when the trust dies, love dies like government spies

It's true lies
