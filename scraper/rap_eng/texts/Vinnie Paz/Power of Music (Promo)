Music is different from any art form in the world
Because it has the unique power to take you back to a specific moment in your life
It’s probably the closest thing we have to time travel
It allows you to re-live a memory or release the emotions surrounding that memory with unparalleled detail
You could be sitting in a restaurant, driving in your car and a particular song comes on and takes you to that exact time and place in your life like no book, or movie, or painting could ever do
I guess that’s part of the reason why I gravitated to becoming a musician;
It’s what made me a fan of music and what made me wanna make music in the first place
I've had fans send me mail from all over the world telling me that my music had changed their lives, that my music helped them get off drugs, or helped them get through a death of a family member
You understand how important that is to me
That’s definitely the best complement you could get as a musician
That’s why I make music
Everybody says this to the point where it’s a cliché but the money is secondary
I make music to move people, to inspire people
That’s what I was put here to do and that's what I'm gonna to continue to do
