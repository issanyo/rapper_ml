[Intro]
Uno
Dos
Tres
Quatro

I bet it's easier to look the other way
So glad to go on living, day to day
And today, if maybe we forget about the helpless hand
So sad because he's wishing his life away

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
I couldn't count all the blessings I had
My mama happy, my son good
What else could I ask?
I'm thankful for hard times and the lessons they pass
And I'm grateful for having answers to the questions I ask
I'm grateful for sight, I'm grateful to hear
When I was younger I was everything I hated I swear
I thought the world was out to get me in a state of despair
Just an egotistical asshole, my faith was impaired
I always was complainin' and I always was the victim
It never was my fault and it always was the system
You think the world owe you something, you wrong
And worship means sincere thankfulness to Allah
I'm thankful for the ability to say when I'm wrong
Thank you for this opportunity to play you this song
I'd like to thank every single one of y'all for riding with me
Y'all made all my dreams come true and united with me
Yeah!

[Chorus]
Thank you for the way to love
Thank you for the world I'm thinking of
Thank you for the way to love
Thank you for the world I'm thinking of

I bet it's easier to look the other way
So glad to go on living
And today, if maybe we forget about the helpless hand
So sad because he's wishing his life away

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
I thank you for the ability to learn from mistakes
I'm grateful for hard work, I had to learn what it takes
I'm thankful for hard times when it burns and it aches
'Cause it remind me of the blessings been bestowed on my plate
I'm indebted to every one of y'all that ever bought a record
To anyone who's stolen I'm still thankful that you checked it
I'm thankful for my homies who don't ever get the credit
'Cause God know that being my homie, it takes some effort
I'm grateful I'm unconditionally loved by my family
Even when shit was ugly and they didn't understand me
I never got a gold record, never won a grammy
But God been my protector and that's why the devil fear me
I'm grateful that my son still love to hug his papa
I'm grateful that Allah gave him to me, it's an honor
I'm seeing things more clearly now so I'm thankful
So I just had to take a minute out and tell you thank you


[Chorus]
Thank you for the way to love
Thank you for the world I'm thinking of
Thank you for the way to love
Thank you for the world I'm thinking of

I bet it's easier to look the other way
So glad to go on living
And today, if maybe we forget about the helpless hand
So sad because he's wishing his life away
