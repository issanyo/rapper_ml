[Leaf Dog]
I stay focused like the sights through a snipers scope, coming for your throat assassins hidden in the moat
Underneath the kings boat, so it's set in stone like tales of gladiators from ancient rome
I'm something you can't own like eternal life, what I dont live to see my words will through this mic
I'm the type to write bars when I sleep at night, get samples like an archeologist on a dig site
If this kid's right then me an my fam are all wack, but that's as likely as my dead friends comming back
Reenact war scenes of a great conquerer, when I spit bars to inspire like a philosopher
Been clockin' ya but the truth your excusing a world calculated like the change of evolution
There's no retribution when the last drink's served, so until it's time to strike we wait and observe

[Hook:Leaf Dog]
Yo, clear your mind always analyze a situation. Prepare for meditationX2
Grab ur herb sacks deal with facts and dedicationx2

[Vinnie Paz]
Take ten steps then draw and then the ratchet out, on warpath since season of the assassin's out.
Either sippin' on some goose or a massive stout, its no fear Amir Khan knock a faggot out
Vinnie ready for a war with no provocation, y'all a bitch I'll never fight a sovereign nation
I ain't a rapper shooting guns is my occupation, the 4 fifth is ridic' an it'll rock your face in
Y'all know that Paz is a beast an I don't give a fuck Vinnie blast the police
Give me the stash or the leaf, y'all al be the same mother fuckers getting mashed over beef
The fucking gutter is my home, I'mma cut the mother fucking head of whoever on the throne. (The throne is mine baby)
The box cutter to your dome, this is Vinnie Paz an the wrath of the brothers of the stone yeah

[BVA]
Yo the calculator, sat back studying mistakes in your breaks I can't wait till I devastate ya
Fuck God this is an act of nature, so you can show me the respect that you give to your creators
In the battle, we'll take the high ground knowing that I meditate daily burn a zoogie then I lie down
My heads out walking the sky's town, I use patience with an acquaintance or two an bring a tight sound
Rapping round your windpipe now, take your confidence, we take compliments bring it back like its reconnaissance
Think your a player but you're on the bench, you speak the nonsense, see you acting dame like you're Judy Dench
The entrants are the calm ones with napalm bombs, thats dropping out the mouth making dark songs
Heads ain't keeping their part strong, we sit back calculate, meditate then we march on

[Hook]
