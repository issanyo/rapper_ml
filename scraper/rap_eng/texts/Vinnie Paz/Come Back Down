[Verse 1: Slaine]
I’m too far away from home now
I’d never turn back
I was scorned, I was spurned
I had to learn fast
I took the turn past alley
With the burned crack
The future slippin through my fingers with no firm grasp
[?] stink of liquorish
Joints  with sherm in it
Smoke expanding my lung
The damage is done
It’s permanent
My brain fried
Eyes like the pain died
Can’t hide my anger
I thought we was on the same side
Strangers I know em so long
Got familiar features
Resilient leeches suck the blood from the brilliant teacher
So listen close to the villains speeches
His spirit’s dark but I hear
His heart is broken in a million pieces
Fear's a part of each of us
Teared by the secrets
And judge his life by psychotic scenes outta sequence
This is not a dream
We just adapt to losing
I need relief from all the truth
I’m going back to using

[Chorus: Regan Hartley]
I’ve picked my soul back up
More than a thousand times
I’m goin' out my mind
Trapped in a house of lies
And after all I know
Freedom is such a high
But how do I compromise
Cause I don’t ever wanna come back down

[Verse 2: Checkmark]
I’m too high to even hear ya
Can’t risk the failure
Made me obsessed
Collective paraphernalia
Focused on the trophies
Hammer throw the scenario
Cavieres hero
Cavalier in the aerial
Zero to a buck and change
Burn out the clutch and bang
Turn speed bumps to free jumps
Ain’t nothin changed
Something strange in the air when you up here
Don’t notice the stares
Cause I’m shining with the sun’s glare
Or is the rain that numbs fears?
Years with a father too far to wipe his son’s tears
It’s all relative family a plan B
Floating so I won’t even notice you can’t stand me
Can’t see, think or hear
Staring in the sink it’s clear
That I’m hopeless
I’m only focused when I’m drinking beer
I set the bar
Need relief from all the pressure
So I’mma leave the earth
But it won’t be upon a stretcher
I’m gone

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
I’m always drunk out here
Too much skunk out here
Too much time on the road
I’m in a funk out here
Missin everyone
My heart is always sunk out here
Wishin I could end it all
With my gun right here
The funk guy always dumb
I am takin pills
But at the end of the night I’m still shakin still
Never thought I’d be the person, I will break his will
This use to be fun to me now it’s pain not thrill
I talk alot about death so I should do it soon
Maybe under the cold breeze of a blueish moon
I gotta think about my brother
Wouldn’t do this to him
I throw the left hook, everyone bruised and ruined
I kiss my son, face is warm
His mother hate me
And that’s why I’m adjacent to him
It’s important for a father education to him
And equally it’s important to know my brain is ruined

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Slay you my brother
Yea
Philly all day
Official pistol
Cause I don’t ever wanna come back down
