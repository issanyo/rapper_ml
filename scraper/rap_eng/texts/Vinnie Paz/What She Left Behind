[Intro]
Tonight on Channel 5 News at 11
A grizzly story of a step-father gone mad
The violent details have left the local neighbourhood in shock

[Chorus]
I still hear your voice in my mind
I still hear your voice in my mind
Such a lovely voice (na na na na na na na)
Such a lovely voice (na na na na na na na)

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
I barely want you here, you think I want them here?
This is my fucking house, you think that I'ma pretend here?
They ain't my fucking blood, this ain't my kin here
Don't make me slap you up again and break a limb here
And this little one, he always starin' at the wall
Is he retarded or somethin', or he don't care at all?
You bring that autism shit up again, I swear to God
I told you it's all in your head, you couldn't bear the thought
I told you it's not a disorder, it's bad mothering
And you don't make it any better, you just choose to smother him
And this other one, she dresses like a harlot
So don't come runnin' to me when she claims she gets assaulted
And boys is gonna be boys, so they ain't to be faulted
With bitches dressed like that it's cause they wanna be exalted
So don't give me no fucking excuses, or she could get it too
I pay the bills in here, we both know that it's never you
It's my way or the highway, so make a fucking choice
Cause I don't like the way you make me raise my fucking voice
Matter fact, I'm outta here, I need a fucking beer
The choice is yours, get it together or disappear

[Chorus]
Such a lovely voice (na na na na na na na)
Such a lovely voice (na na na na na na na)
Such a lovely voice (na na na na na na na)
Such a lovely voice (na na na na na na na)

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Why the fuck ya'll still awake?
I need some time alone
The little one is crying, the other always dialin' the phone
You think I'm being rough on you? Well, I don't think I am
Watch me when I put you in this yoke and show you who I am
You're paying attention to me now? Now that I got violent?
When none of ya'll would move a fucking finger I was silent
I thought I had this beaten, and I thought that I was past it
Cause every woman that have come before you got they ass kicked
One of them was hospitalized, the other one was murdered
I made it look like accidents, cause both of them deserved it
But here we are, and I thought I have put this shit behind me
But what I'm feeling now has overcome me and has blind me
So why the fuck you're trying me?
I had to break the straw
And since this little one is cryin I have to break his jaw
And since your daughter dressing up and trying be a whore
I have to teach her a lesson and slide up in her raw
But that can wait for now, I'm gonna finish what I've started
I told your boy to shut his fucking mouth, is he retarded?
I'm the fucking victim here, the one who's brokenhearted
The one who no one loved, who was mistreated and discarded
The one who got abused and who was beaten all his life
The one who got confused and who was bleeding from the knife
I was drug through the mud, I was condescended
So I'ma take the three ya'll with me and I'ma end it
The cops is on their way now? Well, I ain't goin' to federal
But I ain't dyin' alone so now the three of ya'll is dead too

[Chorus]
I still hear your voice in my mind
I still hear your voice in my mind
Such a lovely voice (na na na na na na na)
Such a lovely voice (na na na na na na na)
