[Intro]

Houston police say that the CIA and the FBI both say that Carnaby never worked for either agency, but his family tells a very different story saying the 52 year old spent about 30 years serving his country

[Verse 1:Ill Bill]

Ayo the pilot had his gun drawn
Like when the shoe-bomber Richard Reid bit that stewardess’ thumb off
You're done for
When you die you go to Heaven, till then welcome to Hell Spawn
Celtic Frost at the Felt Forum, I’m never wrong
Stop acting tough, small criminals can steal more money with laptops than with a mask or a gun
Intelligent relevant heretic elegant terrorists
Presenting death sentences with malevolent eloquence
Label you larger than Hajj and spark a jihad
Adolescent martyrs in mosques ? bombs
While the lords of war barter their arms
Concentration broken by the sound of fight jets barking at God
Gat shooters they snatch AKs and chains
My shooters snatch planes and cause international mayhem
In the mountains of Caucasia caught four pagans in an orgy with lord Satan
Onward the war rages

[Hook]x2
I’m surrounded by hatred and lust
Angels and dust
Cocaine and sluts
Dangerous thugs
Blaze you with guns
Lace you with drugs
Murderous cyborgs disguised as blind men with guide-dogs
Design wars
It’s the final call

[Verse 2:Vinnie Paz]

Phony money and economics, that’s the shit predicted by the prophets
Black guns, black helicopters
What is the connection between Jesus and the Shriners?
What is the question to the virus and Osiris?
That’s why the gun is always on the hip
I learned to never sleep on devil and to come equipped
I don’t never speak on nothing, always button-lipped
Whether it’s why the Sun exists or if it’s rugged shit
Y’all are devilish and Vinnie move with God power
I called Bill to go him meet me at the God hour
It’s never been a question whether or not I’m star power
The only question is whether or not the God’s sour
Yeah in other words sick of the Amorite
Reverend Dr. Malachi Z. York had it right
Dealing with sound right reasoning and acting right
Teaching people how to handle ratchets and a hatchet right

[Hook]
