[Hillary Clinton]
We came, we saw, he died
We came, we saw, he died
We came, we saw, he died
We came, we saw, he died
We came, we saw, he died
We came, we saw...

[Chorus]
Yeah, break, motherfucker
Yo, they're making you an offer that you can’t refuse
Yeah, break, motherfucker
Yeah, you bet against the house and you’re gonna lose
Yeah, break, motherfucker
We’re all fucked no matter who we choose
Yeah, break, motherfucker
Yeah, you bet against the house and you’re gonna lose

[Verse 1]
Bare witness
Yo, business is business
A two-faced coin - either side there's no difference
Who can you buy to tell a lie?
This shit is viscous
The deck is rigged, don't call 'em out - they keep a hit list
Two sides polarized, social suicide
Homegrown invasion to enslave the nation, but you decide
Burn the ballots, sweep 'em under the rug
Who's your leader?
Trick question - none of the above

[Donald Trump]
They are not our friends. When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people

[Chorus]
Yeah, break, motherfucker
Yo, they're making you an offer that you can’t refuse
Yeah, break, motherfucker
Yeah, you bet against the house and you’re gonna lose
Yeah, break, motherfucker
We’re all fucked no matter who we choose
Yeah, break, motherfucker
Yeah, you bet against the house and you’re gonna lose

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
You think the war room is any different now
You're dumb enough to think that this is another system now
You're living in another prison now
Different warden, but you in the same position now
You think that both party leaders ain't living foul
A hundred thousand troops is on another mission now
The deep pockets of corporate wealth are shifting now
You think a fundemental change is a decision now?
The tax payer funding traveling is the same
This accident we call a foreign policy the same
Exactly, their voice is still the same
Homeland security and borders is the same
Somebody need to take a shot at the machine
Learn to fix your own mess and not to intervene
The blind lead the blind, vision at stake
How you left these motherfuckers with decisions to make, stupid

[Bridge]
You wanna keep 'em silent
You try to keep 'em silent
You wanna keep 'em silent
But the people wanna riot
You try to keep 'em silent
But we wanna fucking riot

[Breakdown]
We wanna fucking riot
We wanna fucking riot
You wanna keep 'em silent
(The people wanna riot)
You try to keep 'em silent
(We wanna fucking riot)

[Chorus]
Yeah, break, motherfucker
Yo, they're making you an offer that you can’t refuse
Yeah, break, motherfucker
Yeah, you bet against the house and you’re gonna lose
Yeah, break, motherfucker
We’re all fucked no matter who we choose
Yeah, break, motherfucker
Yeah, you bet against the house and you’re gonna lose
