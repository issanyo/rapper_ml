[Intro: David Icke]
The greatest form of control is where you think you're free, when you're being fundamentally manipulated and dictated to. One form of dictatorship is being in a prison cell and you can see the bars and touch them. The other one is sitting in a prison cell but you can't see the bars but you think you're free.

What the human race is suffering from is mass hypnosis. We are being hypnotized by people like this: newsreaders, politicians, teachers, lecturers. We are in a country and in a world that is being run by unbelievably sick people. The chasm between what we're told is going on, and what is really going on, is absolutely enormous.

[Hook: Block McCloud]
It's like we all know what's goin' down
But no one's sayin' shit, what happened to the home of the brave?
These motherfuckers, they're controllin' us now
But no one's talkin' about it, made us modern day slaves
And everybody's just walkin' around
Head in the clouds, we won't awake until we're dead in the grave
By then it's too late, we need to be ready to raise up
Welcome to the end of days

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Everybody a slave, only some are aware
That the government releasin' poison in the air
That's the reason I collect so many guns in my lair
I ain't never caught slippin', never underprepared
Yeah, the Shaitan army, they display it proudly
George Bush the grandson of Aleister Crowley
They want you to believe the lie that the enemy Saudi
The enemy ain't Saudi, the enemy around me
There's fluoride in the water, but nobody know that
It's also a prominent ingredient in Prozac
How could any government bestow that?
A proud people who believe in political throwback
That's not all that I'm here to present you
I know about the black pope in Solomon's Temple
Yeah, about the Vatican assassins and how they will get you
And how they cloned Barack Hussein Obama in a test tube

[Hook: Block McCloud]
It's like we all know what's goin' down
But no one's sayin' shit, what happened to the home of the brave?
These motherfuckers, they're controllin' us now
But no one's talkin' about it, made us modern day slaves
And everybody's just walkin' around
Head in the clouds, we won't awake until we're dead in the grave
By then it's too late, we need to be ready to raise up
Welcome to the end of days

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Whoever built the pyramids had knowledge of electrical power
And you know that that's the information
That they suppress and devour
Who you think the motherfuckers that crashed in the tower?
Who you think that made it turn into ash in an hour?
The same ones that invaded Jerome
The ones that never told you about the skeletons on the Moon
Yeah, the ones that poison all the food you consume
The ones that never told you about Mount Vesuvius Tomb
The Bird Flu is a lie, the Swine Flu is a lie
Why would that even come as a surprise?
Yeah, the Polio vaccine made you die
It caused cancer and it cost a lot of people their lives
Do y'all know about Bohemian Grove?
How the world leaders sacrificin' children in robes?
Lucifer is God in the public school system
I suggest you open up your ears and you listen

[Hook: Block McCloud]
It's like we all know what's goin' down
But no one's sayin' shit, what happened to the home of the brave?
These motherfuckers, they're controllin' us now

And everybody's just walkin' around
Head in the clouds, we won't awake until we're dead in the grave
By then it's too late, we need to be ready to raise up
Welcome to the end of days

[Outro: David Icke]
The greatest hypnotist on the planet Earth is an oblong box in the corner of the room. It is constantly telling us what to believe is real. If you can persuade people that what they see with their eyes is what there is to see, you've got them. Because they'll laugh in the face of an explanation that portrays the bigger picture of what's happeningâ€¦ and they have.
