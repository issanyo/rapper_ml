King Kong, ain’t got shit on me!

[Verse 1 - Apathy:]
Bring out the apes the gorillas the monkeys the junkies
Half money half bummy half genius half dummy
Dirty, slutty, bloody, muddy, filthy fuck buddy
If you’re stupid you should study how I’m steady making money
Like I’m Steady B, Freddy Krueger, bald as Lex Luthor
Spark buddha, pick a public park become a sharpshooter
Chop an off-duty cop up into chop suey
Channeling 2Pac through me (hock tui) damn I’m such a Glock groupie
Bad grammar, bad manners, bad hammers, bad mama jama hammer boppin
Got your grandma yellin like she’s Janice Joplin, I’m joshin
Please get off my johnson, I see you bitches jockin this jargon that I’m jotting
I’m Jesus a genius a G I’m a genie
Grantin bitches wishes if they wish is for my pee pee
I’m greazy and greedy and creepy and freaky and skeevy
Your breezy, but fuck me for a CD

They are very very dangerous, they are wild animals
Something’s got to be done

[Chorus - Vinnie Paz:]
Look at all this wild shit ya’ll got me on
With fire arms now it’s on like Honkey Kong
Where my gorillas at? Where my apes at?
Where my gorillas at? Where my apes at?

Look at all this wild shit ya’ll got me on
They play this song and it’s on like Honkey Kong
Where my gorillas at? Where my apes at?
Where my gorillas at? Where my apes at?
