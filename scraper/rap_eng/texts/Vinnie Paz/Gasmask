[Chorus: Vinnie Paz]
We go, where them can't go
Carlito, Benny Blanco
We know, what them not know
Mijo, kill 'em pronto
We go, where them can't go
Carlito, Benny Blanco
We know, what them not know
Mijo mi gente, they kill 'em pronto

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Catch hommies in hellfire, water under the bridge Tacony-Palmyra
Devotion to the blood of the lamb, and it's hail sire
The pistol pack po' with the preacher, the pale rider
This a chainsaw bayonet, homie it is modified
Crosses on this mahfucker head like it's Mardi Gras
Theology of multitude and everything it occupy
Molecules combine with further molecules and oxidize
An animal, and animal survive through the pain
This a 300 blackout disguised as a flame
Erbody takin' Ls like they ridin' the train
Y'all my offspring, why would I deprive you of fame?
I look at y'all as food homie, y'all a bunch of vics
But snitchin' what you do and I can get a bunch of ticks
It was cold nights out here, take you to task
Cut the lawn mahfuckers 'cause there's snakes in the grass
Toma!

[Chorus: Vinnie Paz]
We go, where them can't go
Carlito, Benny Blanco
We know, what them not know
Mijo, kill 'em pronto
We go, where them can't go
Carlito, Benny Blanco
We know, what them not know
Mijo mi gente, they kill 'em pronto

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah
These mother fuckers saw a ghost, they awoken a wraith
Erbody hit the fuckin' floor or open the safe
The main pillar of the science is devotion of faith
This a Armalite rifle, it'll blow through your face
Black queens night ahki, ((do to the palm???))
I carry this .55 like it's Louis Vuiton
We can talk the evolution of a beautiful swan
Or we can talk the revolution, constitutional harm
Erbody wet as soon as the hammer splash
Nobody seein' nothin' like a camera flash
Shooters everywhere B, I'm callin' mi hermano
Spark Steakhouse, homie Pauly Castellano
These is monolithic bullets, these'll riddle you red
So fuck all of y'all bitches homie, chivalry dead
Gemstars, G36s, bayonets et cetera
It's what a motherfucker get for preying on a predator

[Chorus: Vinnie Paz]
We go, where them can't go
Carlito, Benny Blanco
We know, what them not know
Mijo, kill 'em pronto
We go, where them can't go
Carlito, Benny Blanco
We know, what them not know
Mijo mi gente, they kill 'em pronto
