[Intro: Manhunter sample]
If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is
You put it together, you get being wanted and desired enough times
He believes he will become one who is wanted and desired and accepted
Because God has power
And if one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah.. Jedi Mind, baby..
Yeah..
Yeah, we bringin' you the hardcore, the real raw type shit
You ain't never seen nothin' before like this
It's all real, all ill, and all natural
We all kill, all steal and blast at you
I like blood, I like tastin' ya flesh
I like slugs,  I like David Koresh
I like anything that's related to death
I like any king that can reign with his fist
Now back to the topic at hand
Steadily Shine, Shine Steadily with my fam
I'm the one who put the nail in the cross
I'm the one who told the world about an alien corpse
I'm the one who brought the truth to the light
If you listenin' to me you couldn't lose in a fight
Abusing the mic, with the force of five lions
Anybody fuckin' with Paz can die tryin'

[Hook: Stoupe]
{*Mixed sound clips*}
"Haven't you ever heard of a MC-murderer?"
"It doesn't matter what you say, or what you do"
"Lawnmower man sharp blades slash your vitals"
"While the Technics spin"
"Turn your body into anti-matter"

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
I'm a caged lion, always dying to hurt you
Always a believer that my rhyming a virtue
You just a heathen, and you lie like the church do
I can't believe that Allah hasn't cursed you
You too commercial, you still a disgrace
You like to sit around with women watching Will & Grace
I can't over-stand your sweetness
You should try hire a therapist to beat this
I'm being facetious, you should heed this
I'm the one who hammered the first nail in Jesus
I'm the definition of Toxic
Anyone who ever got close to me got sick

[Hook: Stoupe]

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
We like heavy metal, listening to Sepultura
Remain calm, study Islam and read Torahs
You can't fallow the path so man chill
You can't study the math, you can't build
You can't over-stand what I believe
You drown in an ocean of God and can't breathe
It's like I've been involved with beef
Since the days I lost my teeth with the God and Reef
I learned how to worship Allah
I learn how to rhyme, and I teach it to y'all
I'm speakin to y'all, it's hardcore, real rap
Real slugs, real clips and real gats
You real wack, and that's how I feel
And that's the reason that I got a reason to kill

Yeah.. follow me, daddy
Jedi Mind, what's the fuckin' deal?
Walk with me, yeah, yeah
