[Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah
One, two, pack pistol Pazienza
Yo, Stoupe, yeah yeah this shit's crazy
Yeah

[Chorus]
He ain't gonna act right
He ain't got a one two
Murder, murder gunplay
All these killers hunt you
No honor amongst thieves 'round here
Sniff OC's and dope d's 'round here

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
It's no honor amongst thieves
You should've knew he was foul
Ain't no beating me you dummies should've threw in the towel
And if I owe you, Vinnie threw in the vow
And these pistols gonna blow like we do in the trap
Listen, I saw son name scribbled on the document
Disembodied Nephilim aboriginal occupant
The witchcraft watches an indivisible monument
Nebuchadnezzar, the prophetic vision of Solomon
A real thin line between the Wesson and the sword
Pistol gang Pazzy have you questioning the lord
You backwards motherfuckers wrestling with fraud
Recording in the bedroom the best you can afford
There's sneaker boxes but there ain't no shoes up in the box
The rap Paul Bunyan, Vinnie moving with an ox
Pistolero Pazzy gonna be shooting at an ock
The 50 cal Barret lift a loser out his socks

[Chorus]
He ain't gonna act right
He ain't got a one two
Murder, murder gunplay
All these killers hunt you
No honor amongst thieves 'round here
Sniff oc's and dope d's 'round here

He ain't gonna act right
He ain't got a one two
Murder, murder gunplay
All these killers hunt you
We cut coke and sell jums round here
We push dope and tote guns round here

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
I ain't fucking with you money I'm just grinding through the gristle
I kept my eyes peeled because I'm riding with a whistle
Fiocchi hollow points, they just colliding with the tissue
The makti and Gaadafi were providing me with missiles
This dirty motherfucker always cooking me the pies
The same motherfucker couldn't look me in the eyes
I know the fucking D's gonna book me if he dies
His head got popped boy, you shouldn't be surprised
You got shooters? I got shooters, we can do the thing
Once they see the guns they gonna be talking like they Pootie Tang
Bullets coming back at motherfuckers like a boomerang
They knock me on some stupid shit and have me doing two in chains
Did a lot of talking when the powder on his man
There's burn marks and gunpowder on my hand
What type of shit is that? That's the move a sucker make
You don't wanna scrap I'll take you out like it's a fuckin' date

[Chorus]
He ain't gonna act right
He ain't got a one two
Murder, murder gunplay
All these killers hunt you
No honor amongst thieves 'round here
Sniff oc's and dope d's 'round here

He ain't gonna act right
He ain't got a one two
Murder, murder gunplay
All these killers hunt you
We cut coke and sell jums round here
We push dope and tote guns round here

[Outro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, pack pistol Pazzy
