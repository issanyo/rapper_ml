[Excerpt: Pope John Paul II]
"Everything that I could say would fade into insignificance compared with what my heart feels, and your hearts feel, at this moment."

[Intro: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
Yea, yo, yo ,yo ,yo
Jedi Mind
Heavenly Divine
Steadily shine
Ikon the fuckin' Hologram
Yo, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 1: Ikon the Hologram]
Another sacrificial lamb, that died at the hands of Hologram
Send him into the dungeon and bludgeon his fuckin' clan
Holy lamb, Who spit the live shit
The do or die, Illadelph, Jedi Mind shit
The hot shit, live raps crack your jaw
Like who's the avenger, and who's at the center of war?
I left a scar, so your crabs would overstand
Mental will dent you and send you to a holy land
Lawnmower man, sharp blades slash your vitals
Recitals will fight you and entice you to burn bibles
Homicidal, A Hologram burn churches
Murders by stickin' a crucifix through your cervix
Divine purpose, for the Remy that's in my thermos
Greatest evils stick you with needles that's hypodermic
You heard the verdict, I'm with Allah 'cause he chose me
Broke into the Vatican, strangled the Pope with his rosary
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what...

[Hook: x2]
Jedi Mind
Heavenly Divine
Steadily shine in '99
What, what

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
MC's face terror wherever my sound's audible
Man from third world portals, battle mortals, and slaughter you
Seen inside the visions of beyond
The dwellings of the Om, Existing in Islamic pantheon
Flows drop degrees, all my clothes got the scent of trees
I lay back and blow sax like Kenny G
PPower blast, wack on my path, devour fast
I leave you with the grain of sand in life's hourglass
Devise a spell, make demons rise out of hell
Grab you by your lapels and rob you of your outer shell
You feel the ill dire, messiah in hellfire
I launch writers, put your jaw in a gauze wire
Jedi swordsman, give rappers a foul fortune
With science to contortion your body into a coffin
Insane damage is done, you fuckin' with the army
We beat your skull into the shape of a wet bag of laundry
What, yeah, yeah

[Hook: x2]
Jedi Mind
Heavenly Divine
Steadily shine in '99
What, what

[Verse 3: Ikon the Verbal Hologram, Just Allah]
Yo, the gods are rhymin', they're dramatizin'
You feel the poetic blow of the titans
We like a fuckin' bolt of lightnin'
The three wise men, we at levels that defies men
Watch out for fake heads deviled disguised men
Arriving from the dawn and spawned with ill forms
That'll leave you laying dead in the womb like stillborns
The mass'll here it, the ominous, the master spirit
Can't understand the language of rappers with bad lyrics
Ikon the python, rappers are left strangled
I overlook the Earth 'cause I see it from sun's angle
Above the clouds, we sit high and we dazed
Write a page, on how you enslaved to worldly ways
Islamic marksmen, seein' the squadron
Could be a fatal mistake
Like the first sins of Adam in the garden
You feel sorrow, I'm projected as god Apollo
Explore rhymes, your left too confused to follow
Invite your town to absorb the sniper rounds
Illadelph, Shambhala, nigga
[Both] Stayin' underground, What!
What, motherfuckers

[Hook: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
Jedi Mind
Heavenly Divine
Steadily shine in '99
What, what
