[Intro]
"The rapper Ikon be throwing cerebral blows in telepathic forms"
"The rapper Ikon be throwing cerebral blows in telepathic forms"

[Verse 1: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
Complexities break entities when hardcore be the factor
Physically shattered by the cause of the megacosm distractor
Fractured by my supernatural forces, face losses
As I break backs like Superman on horses, word ajar
Ancient warrior like Thor
Spiritual like the Ibis god Thoth
Complex construction by the technician will dismantle your collective mind
Enemy of mankind, with Egyptian archaeological finds
Dwelling in the dungeon of time
Monomaniacal beat seeker
Swarming like locusts into your speaker
Examining your communication system with cybernetics
Key notes of my flows or get froze with cryogenics
East coast domination for the D-U-B massive
Gathering at black masses to gain knowledge of the clashes
Of past rhythmic masters
After the smoke clears, brain matter is discovered
Smothered by my soundscapes that have left you dismantled
Enchanted by my verbals as Ikon be burning candles

[Hook]
"The rapper Ikon be throwing cerebral blows in telepathic forms"
"Futuristic, neva antiquated"
"The rapper Ikon be throwing cerebral blows in telepathic forms"
"Forcing cataclysms, to serve a purpose"

[Verse 2: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
Emerging from the mist is not an individual but four
Hardcore concepts causing everything to be raw
8804 AD causes misery that be abominable
Evil like three times hexagonal
To test my squadron and watch your macrocosm turn to particles
Non-particles are non-particles
Like the nucleus of an atom
The corpuscles which carry the oxygen from the lungs gather patterns
Energy from the soul, black hole, like spirit of Kukido
Sun, black circle of one, level of gravity is none
Transformed by gods of sun
Industrial power get devoured by the demonic
Read the fine rhymes with mental war games like Matthew Broderick
Revive shit, or live shit defy the carcass
My war sons and born sons revolve around darkness

[Hook]
"The rapper Ikon be throwing cerebral blows in telepathic forms"
"Futuristic, neva antiquated"
"The rapper Ikon be throwing cerebral blows in telepathic forms"
"Causing cataclysms, to serve a purpose"

"The rapper Ikon be throwing cerebral blows in telepathic forms"
"Futuristic, neva antiquated"
"The rapper Ikon be throwing cerebral blows in telepathic forms"
"Causing cataclysms, to serve a purpose"

[Verse 3: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
Spiritual violence leave your alliance in microscopic fragments
My circle of darkness is ferromagnetic
Suffer Chinese water torture, my word is water
Transcendental planets will vanish like [?] daughter
Hypnotical regions in my mental, a rhythmic cycle
Recitals of euthenic theories have been retitled
To be digested by the masses, I smash kids with verbals
Gortex through your chest causing incidental murders
Of weak minded emcees getting caught up in my hurdles
Of chemical disruptions by sodium chloride, potassium, denatonium benzote
Ultimate sacrifice to the gods bloodier the kings
Son of Barada, know the mode of darkness like Bhagavadanta Prabhupada
Infinite light, space and time rhyming physics
Polyrhythmic planetariums relate sounds from aliens on other planets
