[Ill Bill]
He who drink blood from the Nile hate the taste
Seen a nun take a demon dick straight to the face
Seen my uncle cook crack like he baking a cake
Matter fact baked brownies with a eight of the shake
Russel Simmons signed the Beastie Boys high on woolas
Rick Rubin was high too when Rick The Ruler was a shooter
Cuban link cable hanging lower than the table
My goons flip you'll be handing over all the paper
Gymnastic flip coke and murder weapons
Savages make your bitch blow the german shepherd
Renegades of doom Supercoven shoot you mother
Gucci jumper Uzi dumper Uzis under 'zuzi bumpers
Kalashnikovs under camouflage
Grafting of the ?-rod, true religion, human, god, shooter squads
Aura like a  Futura mural
Never taking shorts, cause Brooklyn's always the borough

[Chorus: Ill Bill]
Egyptian Moses 24 karat king tut piece
Fuck the Police Righteousness versus lust and deceit
Enough ice to manifest Christ like dust in the weed
Rest in peace Uncle Howie
Rest in peace Sean P
Egyptian Moses 24 karat king tut piece
Fuck the Police Righteousness versus lust and deceit
Enough ice to manifest Christ like dust in the weed
Rest in peace Uncle Howie
Rest in peace Sean P

[Verse 2: Goretex]
My goons corrupt like carpenter's union down the construction
Oven trusted you wrapped in the carpet tied with your lungs busted
?gripe warnings of god protective of vets?
Fertilized flesh left you with the burgundy vest
Surgeon Koresh carverners can't determine your sex
The soul arrest rest no sweat we bury pussies in warchests
Forty tubes emerge from your neck you ain't a soldier yet
The P96 got me holding all the soviets
Tooth and Nail encrypted bones where the evil roam
Im sipping vino, guns up sleeves like the Gambino home
My synagouge invert the priest until his wig is gone
Incinerated my hearts winter like a simple bomb
Artillery like pakistani tecs with the hidden charm
Doctor giggles chemical agents with the kitchen arms
They call me Pyrex guns with reps on the stove
Like Perry King from Riptide throw coke on the boats

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
When I walk into the room y'all better switch your demeanor
Or your team getting washed like a trip to the cleaner
It was love when I pit my first clip in a nina
And my dunny flip birds like he giving the finger
And this ain't nothing lightweight this is a code red
This batiman family left him alone dead
How you gonna say that you eat when there's no bread
I'm dressed to kill in all black like the phone dead
Isaac 14:21, it's a slaughtering
God made a firmament, astrological origin
A younger God asked me to interpret the Quran for him
He told me that the smokeless flame of fire had tortured him
Pour some fucking goose, get Billie some Bob Marley
Or we gon' pop out in the dark like surprise parties
Extended clips they gon' give me like five extra
Make Salat, beam on the Glock and apply pressure
