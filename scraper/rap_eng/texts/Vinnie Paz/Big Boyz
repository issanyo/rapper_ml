[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Can't nobody fuck with you
I'm an animal, I should be kept inside a fucking zoo
You a bitch, your bitch told me she was stuck witchu
Fuck around with me will get you beat like a production crew
I'm Vinnie Paz, cousin who the fuck is you?
Gun brawl, hand to hand, cousin I will muscle you
I used to ride pussy boy for a buck or two
Now I hit you with the lama, body-bag, duffle you
Yeah I do the type of shit that a thug'll do
You the type to be in magazines with men hugging you
That's the type of shit that have me snuffing you
Pull the ratchet out and put a slug inside your bubble goose
I find your kind of rhyme to be insufferable
Put your body in a place where nobody discover you
Bring your whole team, all them faggots sucka too
Peace to Afu brother I'd spill their blood for you
