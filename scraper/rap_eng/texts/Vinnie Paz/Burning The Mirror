[Intro]

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
I'm Kool G Rap, Kaczynski and God wrapped in one
I keep a stupid bitch around me just to stash the gun
Fuck a crucifix, I'll use it just to stab a nun
What y'all did is incomparable to what Paz has done
I'm Black Sabbath, you savages get a lashing tongue
I'm black magic and ravenous, you a passive crumb
I'm a Russian AK and you's a Gatling Gun
I only listen to black metal and rap from Pun
I treat bitches like a jewel thief, smash and run
I write ignorance on looseleaf, that's for fun
You have the female tendencies of a bastard son
They say it's parts unknown where the assassin's from
Hey yo, Jus Allah load the Glock, rob his jums
And tell these sucker motherfuckers that the gods have come
I drink clear liquor all the way to blackened rum
The Glock an icebreaker, I don't mean a pack of gum

[Hook]
We that hardcore, we that hardbody
Y'all that cardboard, y'all that carbon copy
We Islamic Moors, we that godbody
We the Russian AK, we the sawed shotty

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
My babysitter hung herself, I was way too young to help
It's no way I could've lifted her and strung the belt
Wish she could've gave me something else, cruel summer
But I'm always elated to meet the newcomers
I like to stare at models to compare brothels
Putting air in bottles, sharing pot and Aristotle
With the baddest dime inhaling the traffic line
And we don't talk about past times and astral signs
I'm fearless, there's an eeriness to my appearance
I'm experienced in severeness
I'm embellished in devilishness
I'm a detriment to health and wellness
I'm everything selfish and felonious
I'm only aware of unfairness, Islam and Arabic
Nuclear fission bombs and terrorists
More torturers that would know order
I live in close quarters, bodies everywhere
It's an episode of Hoarders

[Hook]
