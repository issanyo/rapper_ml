[Verse 1] Vinnie Paz
The rain is gods tears, it pours when he cry
But know that you welcome in his arms when you die
The rain is the form of a gas in the sky
That bring back life to a plant when it’s dry
The rain purify and wash away dirt
And wash away anything in your life that could hurt
Rain is water in its most pure form
The rain pour down make it cool when it’s warm
The rain sound good on my pain when I’m sleep
The ocean love rain and the drain in the deep
Rain play a role in protecting the ground
Prevents us from the the politicians lettin’ us down
The rain known to alleviate stress
So go for a walk in the rain it’s the best
The rain came then the love came over me
Its Pete's Theme let the love rain over me

[Chorus]
Ooh Let it rain, let it rain
Let me know the cold and how it feels
And I'll never turn away
Ooh feel the pain, beautiful pain
Let me hold on to the memory of how you looked today

[Verse 2] Vinnie Paz
Embrace the pain boy it’s good for the soul
You face the pain and see it could make you whole
Ignoring the pain will make you hurt someone else
Go towards pain it’s a gain for the self
Pain isn’t bad it could make you feel free
It isn’t life threating it make me feel me
Kill two birds with one stone, even three
By recognizing pain is too painful to see
Pain is the opposite, run it to hell fleein’
Negative emotion is key to well being
Anger and pain are an important part of life
Important as the way the sun sets in the night
Pain can help you breathe and calculate fact
Give you time to think and evaluate that
Accepting the pain by breathing slow, breathe deep
And you will never have to feel pain when you sleep

[Chorus]
Ooh Let it rain, let it rain
Let me know the cold and how it feels
And I'll never turn away
Ooh feel the pain, beautiful pain
Let me hold on to the memory of how you looked today
