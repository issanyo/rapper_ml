[Men voices]
Esta es mi familia (This is my family)
Por ella doy la vida (That's why I die for)
Por ella vivo y por ella muero (That's why I live and die for)

[Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Yo, Oh No, what up papa?
This that slime shit
R.I.P. Sean Price
R.I.P. Phife Dawg
Love, peace, and fight for '93
Let 'em know Pazzy

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Removed by the council of the masters of a teacher
The process went much deeper, I'm a believer
I turn batiman body into ether
The fellow sufferer who want to stand to God, neither
Son talked wild and they popped him like Don Diva
I told my shooter not to put the body on a VISA
The son beast need more base, I called Giza
Marc Anthony knew a death before Caesar
Give 'em the business and then send 'em to where the ghost is at
Armed heavenly arm, Gucci over the shoulder strap
Where my fucking soldiers at? All over Jehovah map
Make the toaster clap and put two to your spine like Moses back
This how you supposed to rap, how you fucking roast a track?
This is where fiction and non-fiction can overlap
Fronting like you ain't intimidated, but you know it's that
A worker just a worker, so tell me where the all the coka at

[Hook]
It's that wise older brother, the murderous raspy voice
They waiting for what I spit, MCs get dealt with
That's why somebody got to bleed
You should've let me chill, leave me be

It's that wise older brother, the murderous rapping voice
They waiting for what I spit, MCs get dealt with
That's why somebody got to bleed
So calm down clown 'fore I bring the pound down

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Enscribed in a cunieform text on a cylinder
In Babylon we're forced to shoot it out like Dillinger
They talk of revolution, but nobody is willing to
The way to deal with Lady Liberty is by killing her
A wise man said, "A good scotch never spoils"
The same man said, "A watched pot never boils"
I had every intention to rock, but it got foiled
The cavemen still can't live on hot soil
The PSA-K just splashed 'em in the vestibule
The brain matter looked like vegetables
My philosophy of living isn't too technical
The Yves Saint Laurent is ready to wear reputable
The Desert E .50 cal big as a rhinoceros
The four sided monument, they call it, "Black Obelisk"
Pressing it in every cell of the body like phosphorus
I don't do it simply, it's simply God consciousness

[Hook]
It's that wise older brother, the murderous raspy voice
They waiting for what I spit, MCs get dealt with
That's why somebody got to bleed
You should've let me chill, leave me be

That wise older brother, the murderous rapping voice
They waiting for what I spit, MCs get dealt with
That's why somebody got to bleed
So calm down clown 'fore I bring the pound down

[Man voice]
Nosotros decíamos que había tres caminos nada más para la ganga
Era: cárcel, muerte y hospital
Sabemo' que somo' gangsters
Sabemo' que somo' locos
Sabemo' que lo tiramos por todo
Por el todo por nuestra ganga
¡Y por ella vamos a morir! ¡¿Ah?!
¡Y por ella estamos viviendo!
