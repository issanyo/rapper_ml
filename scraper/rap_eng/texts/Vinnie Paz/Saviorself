[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
I built with Alexander the Great, he told the Persians they should stay gone
Then he told me about the Oracle of Amon
He gave me no clue where it is
Men feared time yet time feared the pyramids
He gave me more jewels
He told me that Amenhotep was immortal
I can't overstand hieroglyph
So I called Killah Priest and he taught me how to follow it
I walked through the Valley of the Kings
With a white robe, white rose and Muwali rings
And your whole team Judas
My road thin, gold skin like Zeus'
I speak the dialog of the dead
I practiced the same war tactics in King Arthur's head
So let the swordsmen kill the beast
It's a Legacy of Blood with Vinnie Paz and Killah Priest

[Hook: Stoupe cuts up samples]
"The Sun Won't Come Out, unless the crowd start this
'Cause if it was my choice, you all dance in darkness"
"Elements burst and gave birth to the worst
Took the pen from the nurse and hold the mic up first"
"Put your rhymes, the rhymes, put your rhymes on the altar
Burn them as a sacrifice"

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
I paint flows with the feathers from the wings of angels
Red ink from saint blood, nigga you ain't thug
Stare into the face of a king's mug, crushed grape fill the wine jug
Ill thoughts build from the mind of rhyme, rose off the tongue like fine rugs
Let me walk you through this for the clueless
I'm Shakespearean with gray earrings
Speak like Tiberians, write novels
Spit it like Aristotle, face half Pharaoh
And half owl, I took the path of Cairo
Came back with the Dead Sea Gospel
Now known as the Dead Street Apostle
We see them Feds, shoot them hollows
Bullets spread till they meet Diablo
Stars in alignment, Priest meet with Jedi Mind Tricks
Reach them climates where you can't breath
Stay high off that dead weed
In the mind is where I plant seeds to grow fruit
Of king's so brute of army troops, mighty men in celestial suits
You need healing, my mic give you incredible boost
Where I use satellite dish and stare at my alphabetical soup
Plus I use the Big Dipper to take more than one scoop
It's Priesthood

[Hook: Stouple cuts up samples]
"Straight up, we serve justice
So if they can't be trusted, may you return where the dust is"
"Put your rhymes on the alter
Burn them as a sacrifice"
"Elements burst and gave birth to the worst
Get the pen from the nurse and hook the mic up first"
"Put your rhymes on the altar
Burn them as a sacrifice"

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
I studied Element 115 with the Elohim
Saw the Canaanites, Sumerians and the Philistines
This is street gospel
If you don't believe in life on Mars, that mean the beast got you
You don't wanna see me and Killah Priest hostile
You don't wanna see desert eag' heat pop you
This is Mothman Prophecy
Walk back to the sand of Iraq and let the prophet breathe
We turned all our water into toxic seas
And walk in war with armor that I copped in Greece
Then I shot the beast with a long arrow
Studied Imhotep to be a strong Pharaoh
It's a war when the gods spit
It's Allah when I split the icebergs in the Arctic
I don't care what the cause is
And I'ma ride for my fam no matter what the cost is
