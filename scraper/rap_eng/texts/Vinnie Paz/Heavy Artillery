(Intro) Paz
Yeah, word is bond
Louie Dogs, Gumar-Oz-Dubar, Jus Allah
Jedi Mind, DJ Kwestion, whattup Stoupe

[Vinnie Paz]
Yo I'm quite calm, write my greatest shit when the light gon'
My hands fast, like Ramadan when the knife drawn
I'm the physical of a tsunami, you a slight storm
This is a spiritual anomaly, a fight song
To guard you now directly in my right palm
Nothing new about it, keep the ratchet with me lifelong
I come through polar caps melt ice gon'
My mother crying to my brother why his life's wrong
Concrete God's school - Allahu Akbar!
The crooked D's in front of the crib inside a parked car
Gumar-Oz-Dubar inside the shot bar
Darts fly at you and severe you like its a sharp star
If we ain't living in hell I'm telling you its hot, bar
Masonic manifestation of God is not far
In reality the sun is just a hot star
The Earth is just a bowl of shit that's where I stomp on

(Hook) Samples 2x
"His blood spill fo'real"
"Heavy artillery in my facility"
"Better call security, it's bout to be on"
"Your whole team is getting blown to smithereens"

[Jus Allah]
I am cyber, I'm a hundred miles of fiber
I am the proprietor of fire, I do not perspire
I fire as I so desire, I'm as dry as a fire and dire
I have tried impossible, I have gotten lightning in a bottle
My logic is not inside a novel
I am unconventional, incomprehensible, it's intentional
It's in general, it's in principle
Undesensitized to the cries
Blind eyes to demise
I'm despised by the skies
Likewise, I am sand and stone
I stand alone
I'm a candle blown, I have hands of bone
I am smart and old, I am dark and cold
I have a pawn shop of parts, I have a heart of gold
I'm a heartless soul, is my heart bestowed?
Death for all, let the closest star explode
