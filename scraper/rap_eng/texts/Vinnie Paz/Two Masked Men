[Intro]
Look over there in the doorway gang
It’s two masked men

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
You fucking round with the masqueraders
Stomp your motherfucking head till it’s mashed potatoes
Ain’t nothing complicated over her it’s back to basics
You a misdemeanor we dealing with massive cases
I only deal with real talk I don’t cast with virgins
I cook it up and bag dimes like a handsome person
Dim the lights, smoke an L, pour a glass of bourbon
The blade is fast enough to slash him up and cast a servant
Caveman used two rocks to start a fire
Trash brothers and bash brothers like Mark McGwire
The true reaper the true speaker the soft liar
Move people confuse people to heart’s desire
Keep one hundred, original, it’s date night
The charges follow your block like ya’ll was Ray Rice
You get slaughtered cause you supportive of gay rights
The sunkiller, I murder day and slay nights

[Hook]
Rah rama
How you doing
What’s up cuzzo
What up
Look over there in the doorway gang
It’s two masked men

[Verse 2: Psycho Les]
Aye I don’t take orders from skateboarders
I shake bootleggers upside down and break tape recorders
It’s like going van with two masked men
Fuck knocking on doors, weblast in and knock your glass in
Out of place, you bet your catalyst
I’m taking the cash and disappearing without a trace
I’m getting A Rap money plus Jewish money
He thinks I can get in pain you is a stupid dummy
I’m in the clubs draining but cooing honeys
Take ‘em backstage and all they wanna do is suck me
We got some common folks robbing pocket books
With children plus the L and villain inside of comic books
So I got the kush, the liquor
I’m a heavy drinker
And I’m a spit till I’m wrinkler than Heavy Wrinkler

[Outro]
Aye, motherfucker
It’s two masked men
Right over there in the doorway gang
What are you doing here?
They’re going to get you
Nope
Light it up, come on, come on, uh, uh ow
