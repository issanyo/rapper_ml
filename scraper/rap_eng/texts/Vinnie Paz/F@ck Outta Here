[Intro]
He's indeed a foe worthy of my metal
But he must be defeated
Lie, my enchanted [?] seek out the enemy!

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
I put the H in heavy metal like the hammer of Thor
Ill Canabill, way before Cannibal Corpse
These baby teen homos
I'm like a 83' chronos
Pay Lionel Richie with bricks to lay promos
I hover vertically, clockwork burgundy
Seven thirty on your block, like the murder spree instant
Secure the gas mask on the infant
Then analyze the galaxy with practical instinct
Stay sharper than zombie weapons
My wolves of war are savage, bark at the moon like a Ferrari engine
Pack a burner blacker than Nat Turner
Jackson [?] Sherman
Track three thousand of black turbans
Lions roar comfortable to most the crime lords
Walking through the firestorm, like the time before
Fuck it like I am the law with a giant jaw
Chop off your motherfucking dome with Goliath's sword

[Hook x2: Vinnie Paz]
Ya bring that shit to Brooklyn?
The fuck outta here!
You wanna get the jewelry tooken?
The fuck outta here!
Ya wanna bring it to Philly?
The fuck outta here!
And get yourself bodied for really?
The fuck outta here!

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
See this black now, everything can go in a glance
I was raised right, I'ma let you know an advance
This the Billy bad knife work, rolling with gangs
And the P-coat laser Mac show you the dance
I'm talking everything, even shell cases is black
And the chopper lay him down like he's taking a nap
Cut his body in sixteen like we playing the [?]
And if I ever gave you anything, I'm taking it back
You lazy and wack, just call me Glenn Rice, I'm a shoot a man
I'ma peel his motherfucking lid like a tuna can
Chest poked out, talking shit like "Who the man?"
Body work had his pussy breathing like a hookah fam
It's a lot of dead bodies everywhere that Vin rides
Smiling on the outside, dying on the inside
Y'all are high, y'all just brought some blues in this bitch
But me and Billy ride, we just brought the tools in this bitch
Muerte!

[Hook x2]
