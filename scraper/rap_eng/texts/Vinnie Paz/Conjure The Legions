[Verse 1: Esoteric]
In '95 this rap style was impressive
By 2005 most rappers lost the message
2014, rappers wearing dresses
Shit is tough to look at like airplane wreckage
Check it
I'ma waste you, the chemicals will lace you
My rep keeps growing like Emma Stone's face do
You recently decent, I've been a beast every season
My pen and speech is the reason I'm pulling wenches with ease
And I'll take that Benz that you're leasing
And put a dent and a crease
In the driver side, leave you leaking
A homicide, call a deacon
I'll have you wheezing in deep
Breathing, the beat I'm just meat
Cleaving, I'm coming to meet
Steven King, I'm a demon ayo

[Verse 2: Planetary]
Keep me out of reach of your children's ears
This the surgeon general warning
You rap moguls I'm the shit to hear
Crystal clear, missiles tear through the fiscal year
Bombs over Baghdad, official pistol issued fear
Fear not, the air is hot, your atmosphere popped
Every bar souvenir, nigga, keep your ears locked
Dog, you must got me chopped
Everything about me rugged
Low rugby ruckus: my middle name and I'm soul crushing
(It's nothing)
Wiping the dust off the Paper Mate
I'll leave a paper trail for my niggas like it's The Great Escape
Save the date, the birthday of the Bathing Ape
No holds barred, bar none, I'mma raise the stakes

[Verse 3: Apathy]
I was raised by a pack of werewolves in the woods
Grew up studying Mobb Deep, 'Give Up The Goods'
Now I'm walking down the block, half human half monster
Stronger, full moon's rise I go bonkers
I'm popular in Hell like The Lox in Yonkers
Glocks and bombers, box full of rocket launchers
Optic lasers, 2Pac tapes and box cutters
I ain't playing with none of you cocksuckers
Make whores stop at the store first to cop rubbers
Got lawyers on retainer if one of these cops touch us
I ain't feeling what they did to Kelly Thomas
Keep guns on us so they'll never beat me unconscious, listen

[Verse 4: Vinnie Paz]
Listen up motherfucker, I'm sick and tired of playing with y'all
My gun told me I'm a sucker for aiming at y'all
I am from a different cloth, no relation to y'all
And when it come to me and you, it's no patience involved
The Luciferian conspiracy of Forward Pass
Allah seeking while y'all are speaking the balderdash
Cipher protocol, indecipherable ocean mask
The Code of Baphomet, I will worship the goat and laugh
Follow what you have found, I will lead you to us
Every single record sold is a beacon to us
He a greaseball but he like a Rican to us
It's like a carnivore eating a vegan to us

[Verse 5: Crypt The Warchild]
You can't tame a villain that's trained for the killing
Insane in the brain off of the pain that he's feeling
I don't tear it down, I cave and break through the ceiling
I don't spare these clowns I continue to drill 'em
I bury them alive to stop the pussy from squealing
Your music's all fool's gold, that's not for appealing
Listen, I don't rhyme without a reason
Money makes me metamorphosize to a demon
Bitches lined up screaming murder for the semen
Two for every one, so I had to bring the team in
AOTP, niggas best to pledge allegiance
So cats are universal with your head right to the cement

[Verse 6: Celph Titled]
Look behind door number one, and it might be a rifle
How dare you think you could read the psyche of a psycho
I got a demon as a house pet
Arsenal equipped with alien technology (what?) that ain't out yet
My CD ain't biodegradable
So they gon' find it centuries ahead but won't have nothing that can play it though (whatever)
Oh the irony, your flesh needs ironing
We buried you in a mountain cape but that was just a minor thing
They say you can hear the beach inside a seashell
But all I hear is "murder" when I load the pump with these shells
Competition might be good but they ain't half as nice
I set the bar so high it interfere with space satellites

[Verse 7: Reef The Lost Cauze]
Your shit is trash homie, please don't hype it
Whatever we spit, these dweebs gon' bite it
Your girl fucked all of us, please don't wife it
These rappers is selling lies but we don't buy it
I live off of three words: release and fire
Y'all described in three words: weak and tired
When I go to war, I don't mean I beat this guy up
I mean I went in his mouth removed his teeth with pliers
I mean... he no longer sleeps at night 'cause
I pulled him out his car and made him eat the tires
This is Hell on Earth, may you all sleep in fire
You'll be the dopest alive the day Reef retires

[Verse 8: King Syze]
They know my rhyming scheme is a pattern of dying dreams
I'm glad it's over, a disease to a dying breed
A pitbull lion who screams, who's surrounded by bees
A pack of wolves, your career will be over with ease
"Nigga please" is a new motto I live by
On records I'm still fly, y'all rappers will still die
We all monstrous, Godzilla spitter honors
Spit on the ground, pollute the soil man and kill the farmers
Y'all all goners I'm still rocking that dope shit
Y'all progress is hopeless, I'm a product of dopeness
I learned from the best, can't you smell the uniqueness?
Animal instinct, I can smell your fucking weakness

[Verse 9: Lawrence Arnell]
The enforcer, change your whole life course
The mic cords be recharging my life force
The nice bul from north, I get the point across
You on our balls, I ain't even on the forth bar
I pack a powerful punch, I make a horse fall
Your shorty wetting her drawers, I make a house call
You get your mouth off, I'm not even here for y'all
I'm here for reasons that have clearly been stated before
The greatest of all, equated to the falling gods
The homie never been accused of ever falling off
Supported by the most offensive rappers breathing air
You wanna keep it fair, get your fucking people here
