Yeah, yeah, as we keep it moving. You're listening to the Priest of Bloodshed. Vinnie Pazienza. Yo word to Allah. We in the lab right now working on God of the Serengeti. The next solo joint by myself. You know I'm sayin'? We in the lab working. Big shouts to DJ Premier. Big shouts to DJ Muggs. Havoc from Mob Deep. Prodigy, what's the word (spanish term). We got a joint together, you know I'm sayin'? Yo DJ Kwestion on the one's and two's. On the zigga-zigga. Always holdin' me down. You're listening to the Priest of Bloodshed. HAHAHAHA..
