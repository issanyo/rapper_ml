[Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz:]
I’m just evil biologically, listen to y’all that make a mockery
Anton LaVey is like a god to me
I am not possibly associated with your democracy
Gary Heidnik is like a shah to me, go to war logically
I conduct self Nostradamusly, I am Ibrahim’s last prophecy
Earth is my property, I am possessed like I’m an apostrophe
Vinny Appice is like a star to me
Paz swears solemnly, cut your fucking head like a lobotomy
Rape the fucking beat like sodomy
Nietzsche and philosophy, I am a vampire, I’m proud to be
I cannot be seen in your photography
Vinnie an anomaly, I am not a part of God’s colony
Three inches of blood on my carpeting making things hard for me
My own family won’t talk to me, I have to pray to Allah constantly honestly

[Chorus]
I’m having nervous dreams, nigga this a murder scene
Yellow tape around the booth, no one heard em scream
He don’t deserve to dream, nigga this a murder scene
Yellow tape around the booth, I’m having nervous dreams

I let my pistol bang, the Official Pistol Gang
So what’s the issue man? I can make a tissue hang
I’m having nervous dreams, nigga this a murder scene
Yellow tape wrapped around the booth, nobody heard em scream
