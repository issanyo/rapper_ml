[Verse 1]
In '86 everyone was smokin' them OooWeez
I was in front of the mirror and tryna be Cool C
Me and Chico was inseperable then
We would day dream about bein' legends again
'87 came but really Pa, shit ain't changed
We was playin Just-Ice and absorbin' his pain
It's the middle of the crack era, I ain't complain
There was money everywhere, it was part of the game
I was tryna write rhymes but I knew they was wack
I was young and I was dumb and I knew it was that
I heard Steady B rhyme and I knew it was crack
See these records change everything, crucial to that
It's the end of the 80s that's when Chic moved to Cali
My father died too, it was loneliness around me
It was hard tryna put all of this shit in perspective
And the only thing I had was my records

[Hook]
I seen so many men get blast and passed away
I had to say bye, bye, bye
I had to say bye, bye, bye (I'm not runnin')
And all these pills I take can't make shit go away
I say nah, nah, nah
I had to say nah, nah, nah
(I'm not runnin')

[Verse 2]
The 90s came and I started drinkin' for the first time, smokin' for my first time, then I sniffed my first line
Chic came back from Cali and we was wildin'
13  bum rushin' Macys, we was violent
The pain game started gettin' a little better
Drinkin' 40z outside no matter the weather
But I was shy about the rhymin' and shit
I was timid, no one knew about the rhymin' and shit
I kept it to myself Pa, that's what I resign to
Then Chic would get drunk like "Vinnie can out rhyme you"
And I ain't had no choice it was battle or bitch
So I started choppin' heads and I channeled and missed
I battled on L and I battled on the block, and I battled in a cell and I battled to the top
I battled a bunch of rappers you would know right now
And I chopped their fuckin' heads but you won't find out
But that got old quick, I started makin' tapes
The tapes turned to records and the records turned to fate
But I'd still go back if I had that chance
It was simple then I ain't have to do that dance

[Hook]
I seen so many men get blast and passed away
I had to say bye, bye, bye
I had to say bye, bye, bye (I'm not runnin')
And all these pills I take can't make shit go away
I say nah, nah, nah
I had to say nah, nah, nah
(I'm not runnin')

[Outro] (Biggie Smalls)
I don't give a fuck about you, I don't give a fuck about you
I'm not runnin'
I don't give a fuck about you, I don't give a fuck about you
I'm not runnin'
