[Intro]
We were willing to die for an ideal and we would die for it again
But we prefer living for it, working for it, safeguarding it

[Hook: Planetary] x2
A.O.T.P., we above the law
See the cops start running nigga call the dogs
They can't see me, I throw that Molotov
And clear the whole field out, nigga call the gods

[Verse 1: Demoz]
I don't give a fuck about you
I swing my blade and take a chunk up out you
Chase the driver that's trying to save you
And lace 'em with the scalpel
Break your Adam's-- apple and clap you and leave you mangled
I'm not the asshole claiming Philly, I'm blowing up the fucking castle
Fuck pity and mercy I'm thirsty for the title
Kill your vitals with verses, curses
And hearses move 'em like Vinny Idol
Take Vinnie and Planet, mould 'em inside a bowling ball
Launch em against the way you claim you carry
Break your shoulders off
Just for showing off you're stupid
I don't threaten niggas, I really do this
Squeeze the juice out of you like embalming fluid
Burn his lid, barbecue 'em and fuckin' burn his ribs
Throw the dress away with the evidence
Burn a fucking wig

[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
I got plans for your murder and I'm ready to discuss em
You're ready to die? Tell God I said, "Fuck him."
Call me Iron Fist motherfucker I aim hard
Bullets are free throw, silencer is the point guard
Said you was a crook but you ain't busting no lead homes
Only jack you pulling is connected to some headphones
The sound of the clap louder than several operas
My sitcom screaming "I'm gonna kill you" across the Teleprompter
Yes I'm sick fuck the Zicam and Zyrtec
How you gonna fight man when y'all resemble Smurfette?
Stretch your neck till your head meets your ass
I'll beat your dad dead now he's a deadbeat dad

[Verse 3: Planetary]
Nothing is ever promised, especially your life I demolish
Too many niggas claim street but wouldn't last in the projects
Too many happy-go-lucky cats rap with no money
Black why you gotta act? I be screaming where the money at?
I never understood your hood mentality
Man you still selling weed on the block dog, that's blasphemy
That's embarrassing, you nickel and dimin'
A small cut off a bundle and you thinking you shinin'
I could rumble in the jungle and tussle with all the lions
My hustle could turn to rustle but for now I'm survivin'
Living
My kids are chillin' and I'm whippin' the new boy
It ain't a Maybach but it's better than your toy

[Hook] x2
A.O.T.P., we above the law
See the cops start running nigga call the dogs
They can't see me, I throw that Molotov
And clear the whole field out, nigga call the gods

[Verse 4: Reef The Lost Cauze]
I'm a motherfucking warlock, get your jaw popped by the raw rock
Use your tongue as a doorstop, with your face I floor mop
Get your pores popped
Like a dermatologist, I'm wildin' with
Thugs who go in your mouth like Polident
I body shit, I ruin you homes
Turn your studio session into a funeral home
Two in your dome
Got young bucks who buck for us
Homie follow the laws of God
And Chuck Norris
A.O.T.P
We in good company
Screamin', "We the fuckin' world champs" like we Chase Utley
My whole fam-o, tuck in the gauge, bustin' them K's
Have your block sounding like the Mummers Parade

[Verse 5: Vinnie Paz]
I've been catching fucking bodies for twenty years
From eating motherfuckers on the street up to bloody tears
Camouflage backpacks, Tims and some money wares
Now these rap faggots fucking sweeter than Gummy Bears
This isn't simple arithmetic, this is ancient math
Make you lose your face in Jehovah/Jay Hova like you was Damon Dash
I take a fucking machete and cut your brain in half
You're fucking with something deadly and Vinnie Satan laughs
I'm the greatest rapper alive
The Vin bias
Cause I ain't get my chance to shine, call me Len Bias
I'll be patiently waiting for you if men try us
I don't call it writing no more
I call it a pen virus

[Verse 6: Apathy]
You faggot mixtape rappers I should snap your throat
Bunch of tracks cracking jokes 'bout crack and coke (release the Krakken)
Ap is the crackers last hope
Honkey Kong fuckin' bitches leaving mattresses broke
If the condom break I'mma tell the bitch to abort
I'm like the sniper on the roof looking out for the stork
Little dogs getting shanked for a box of Newports
There ain't a jail that could hold me cause Ap teleports
Skipping court on the porch with the criminal sorts
You was usin' couch cushions buildin' living room forts
Your mom's pouring yayo on my dick to snort
I only rock a halo to hide horns and pitchforks
