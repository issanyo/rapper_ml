Genocide General...

Yo, everything I see is fucking dead
Bullets everywhere, fucking red
I need the meat to be complete give me the fucking bread
We smoke to get high, shoot guns dust and lead
Struggle to get by
Shoot nuns, nothing said
I been rockin' with Kamachi since nine-five
You a pussy, I'm a fuckin' cat that got nine lives
I keep the ratchet with me, that's where the nine hides
Italian motherfucker come from where wine thrives
We from Philly we was trapped in the dirt
Where the young bols clap at you then clap at your earth
Yeah, so I suggest that you should clap at them first
Cause here in Philly we got shit that make the back of you burst!

[Hook: Demoz]
Man, they say your right hand man ain't your right hand man
Till your right hand filled with money you feel me?
Money's the root of all evil
I guess being broke is the root of all peaceful people
Please be patient
Man, they say your right hand man ain't your right hand man
Till your right hand filled with money you feel me?
Money's the root of all evil

Nigga' you goin' end up dead or dead broke
You goin' end up in the trunk with your head poke
Tie yo' ass up with your son to them bed posts
Beat you in the head, then be out like the Red Ghost
Ain't no fucking line in my rap you can dare quote
Fuck a bear-hug I'll put the game in a bear-choke
Bear-choke nigga's out my way they forfeit
Whores get, dick in they mouth like Orbit
Or Juicy Fruit
Fuck a nigga let the uzi shoot you
You want to get high? i'll give you Lucy Juice (Fuck that, nigga)
Fuck with the squad? I'll turn your hooptie coupe
You bout to get signed? Big deal whoop di doo
Moz, slash Pharaoh true to the skill
Don't greet me, say hello to the funeral bill
Alot of nigga's play stupid and silly but know what they do
When they get a little money and move out of Philly, you know?

[Hook: Demoz]
Man, they say your right hand man ain't your right hand man

[Chief Kamachi]
Yo, yo, yo
This preacher boy trying to tell me my mission on Earth
Walk up in the episcopal church, pistol berserk
Even the Devil say Chief is a sick little jerk
Underground buzz like dirt bees that gristle the dirt
Dear Father, I hate them fag fuckers
Smoking dirty weed with cups of OE at the last supper
Got Mary table dancing, Holy Ghost trying fuck he (Fuckin' heathen!)
A hustler from Nazareth, I ain't no sucker
Might be crazy, a little out of my mind
To the tingling of the serpent that's riding my spine
That aspire me to climb up the fiery vine
Out of the devilish pit where the rebellious once sit
After inhaling one spliff, I zone to the sixes
Big boy Beelzebub, cracked them crucifix's
K-A-M-A-C-H-I, messiah in his riches
AOTP, I never liked you bitches!
