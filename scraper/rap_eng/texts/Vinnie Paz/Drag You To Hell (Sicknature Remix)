Yeah, temperature's rise. It's getting hot. The Sicknature Remix. Wat Paz? Drag 'em to hell

[Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz:]
See I always have respect cause I always talk facts
The .38 and the 50 caliber hot, black
I always left with nothing but I always brought back
I always been a hustler, I pollied go off that
Y'all don't wanna go to work with the boy
There's only two words that describe me: search and destroy
I don't think you wanna get murked by the boy
My shit is military, y'alls is like a nursery toy
It's hurting you boys
My team ain't even hungry, we famished
I murder everybody, fuck collateral damage
I'm animal savage with Hannibal's habits
I'll mangle your cabbage
I walked into the parish and I strangled the faggots
I hang with the baddest brothers, put their trust into Jesus
Run with brothers who's forty guzzlers, Islamic extremists
Ugly and ignorant is how they perceive us
I don't care, I'm trying to deal with my personal demons

Chorus:
It's happening, yes it's fucking happening
I'm grabbing y'all by the throat and draggin' y'all to hell
It's happening, yes it's fucking happening
I'm grabbing y'all by the throat and takin' y'all to hell
It's time to go to hell....
