[Verse 1]
You just started rapping, muhfucker, Vinnie P a vet
Don't believe me yet or this motherfucker will squeeze a TEC
How does a single one of y'all that don't believe in sense
Twenty-five years of people saying that he a threat
I stayed away a while, I ain't thought you need it yet
Big guns come with principles, some like he in debt
The only time you mention my name, to say that he the best
This blood clot weed's got seeds like a Chia Pet
And y'all don't want to be inside the precinct
Dirt-bag bunkie gon' be telling you what he think
Had to reevaluate a little bit and rethink
If I ain't trim the fat from the beef, money, we sink
So duck when 'em hollow tips rip through the air
A fully loaded magazine, the only shit that I share
And the boat tail hollow going to rip through your gear
Every hour, every second, every minute, I swear
Yeah, my first record told you I was the assassin now
So many that's rapping now, I need to cock it back and blaow
You the reason being whack and frail coming back in style
Cause one drop of my blood is dirtier than Pacquiao

[Hook]
Du-du-du-duu
Y'all don't want to push me
Y'all a bunch of pussies
One shot'll sit 'em down
Du-du-du-duu
Y'all a bunch of pussies
Y'all don't want to push me
Blood clot and spin around

[Verse 2]
This is real life, money, this is not a fad
Got some young boys that buck for me like a dollar cab
Drone strike all you muhfuckers like Obama mad
You 'bout to take this life, end in Hell like Apollo had
Load the fucking hollow mag, hit in his attic
And my body only draped in magnificent fabric
Your bitch is a rabbit, the type to suck dick for the carats
What's your life like? How you like living embarrassed
My pistol is lavish, it's like we've got a difficult marriage
Cause she don't like the way I use her when I spit at you savage
This bitch is just magic, dumb-dumb probably shook
Vinnie fat, but he fast if it's time to be book
I'm reminding you rook, Boxcutter talk with his hands
And if you like life, you gon' have to talk to your mans
You Padishah Emperor Shaddam, lost to the sand
This shit is simple, fam, shit is gone according to plan
Blam

[Hook]
Du-du-du-duu (ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Y'all don't want to push me
Y'all a bunch of pussies
One shot'll sit 'em down
Du-du-du-duu
Y'all a bunch of pussies
Y'all don't want to push me
Blood clot and spin around
Du-du-du-duu (yeah)
Y'all don't want to push me
Y'all a bunch of pussies
One shot'll sit 'em down
Du-du-du-duu
Y'all a bunch of pussies
Y'all don't want to push me
Blood clot and spin around

[Outro]
Yeah, Pack Pistol Pazzy!
J-Zone, J-Zone
Official Pistol
I'm the one you call when you need that fly shit, pop
Yeah
It's murder, baby
