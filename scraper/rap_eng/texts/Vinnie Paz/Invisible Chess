(Verse 1)
Hand game nice, you don't wanna scrap with me
Plus I always keep the motherfuckin' strap with me
Asshole at the bar the Billy Batts in me
I throw a four punch combo mad quickly
Why you think I’m always rhyming so passionately?
Why you think I lay out the violence graphically?
If you was smart you would never wanna clash with me
Nonito Donaire, the Filipino Flash in me
And I always got gun on my waist
And the bullet go through either your stomach or face
Disrespect anybody, I don’t run or get chased
I’m DJ Magic Mike, god, pumping the bass
I don’t like human contact up in my space
Or you'll likely get a ball bat up in your face
Pussy rapper you are a fucking disgrace
I’m children of the Corn, Killa Cam god, running with Mase,stupid

(CHORUS)
To me it's not a discussion it's invisible chess/
I am the essence, what you would call hallucinations/
..Have my pawns put you in check.../
Fuck it, who's to say what insane is../

(verse 2)
So your a shooter, boy? A gun man? Iron on your waist?
Rude bwoy i'll let the gemstar wine 'pon your face
You don't stand a chance muthafuckah, I'll lay you out on the corner
Like a stamp muthafuckah, I'm the champ muthafuckah
And this is my city, die with me if your live
Try to feel that vibe with me, Ravenous
Dig your bitch back until it's cavernous
Rib shots, off the top rope and she ain't mad at it
Passionate, pass time persecuting pacifists
Crack baby-facts baby!, I'm just tryna manage it
I am the essence, what you would call hallucinations
Are windows, jump out of one you'll feel rejuvenated
Fuck it, who's to say what insane is?
Who's to say what a saint is? It's prolly the same shit
I learned a portion of that, when I was in stasis
Astonishment is an illusion just like the fame is, what?
