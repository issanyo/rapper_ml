[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'ma let the shotty blow
His head go a different direction to where his body go
A fraction of a second is the time it takes his mind to go
Either way his body going down like he Bohannon
We bare arms like a designer show
I feed the raw and always keep a 4 on me like honour roll
How you talking money when you never see no kinda dough
Broke mafuckas, ass out like Rihanna though
You hearin screams and they say they shot
I got nines and a sack like I'm JJ Watt
They think they nice but fans gonna say they not
It's like a bomb Vietnam when that Ak pop
I don't be in y'all little cities it's no action
This Wilson Combat go through you like Bo Jackson
See we all gorillas here strapped with all the blammers now
I pass em of after I use them like they a hand-me-down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, We gun running like the track team
Why you talking stats without knowing what the stats mean?
The 50.Cal got bodies on it but the Mac clean
My dunny gonna rob for me piedras like a crack fiend
And I ain't wanna take it there, but this the way it has to be
Sometimes it takes collateral damage to make a masterpiece
I lost my motherfucking mind and it ain't coming back to me
When dunny got knocked it's like I lost the other half of me
Me and you can look alike, distinction is the bread different
Shorty and her sister look alike but the hair different
The new Hudson H9 get your head shifted
Disrespect is never tolerated you get air lifted
Cool when papi cooking but he drawn on what the cinnamon
I had to go inside my bag, I'm calling the dominicans
I appreciate y'all, here it's a small token
You talking all the time real killas is soft-spoken
