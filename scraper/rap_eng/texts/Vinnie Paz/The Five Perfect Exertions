[Intro]
The crushing weight of the Tyrant's passage had left nothing unmarked

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
You gettin' split in fucking half by Ikon the Hologram's wrath
But I am the center inside the placenta of math
You clash with cyanide gas and die fast
Rhythmical equivalent of solids, liquids and gas
We smash your science, with the power of Lord Titus
But I am the virus inside of the iris of Cyrus
Upon papyrus, I kill snipers and biting vipers
And strangle you with the organs of rioters who try to fight us
Call me your highness and sip the blood from the phoenix
Who's guilty like the Jews in the crucifixion of Jesus
Murder the heathens and perish in a pit of cobras
Word is bond, my rhymes form into a swarm of locusts
Provoke us and face the Zodiac killers
Five Samurai, do or die, fire spitters
Heavy hitters from the lands of Sudan
Killadelph, Shambhala, Ikon the Hologram
What!?

[Verse 2: Chief Kamachi]
Who's convoluting thoughts in self
This corpse and I know I spent
To the opening of a similar rift
And it's lost in a different set free
Scimitar for street a mention
Didn't ask for this world
It was complimentary to my righteous entry
We fit on the tree of life and consciousness
We get complex it's my last phrase
The message was colder air
With the appropriate pen
Dress a side with colored gin
Descending on a capital I can
Leave respect for the moon
Let the sun shine behind
I meditate to attain a state of nirvana with finer minds
And the mind is too [?] with yoga
Stretching to China
Then ponder on the wisdom from the old comedic genre
It's the master builder
Seen many jewels to fill ya
Control your lower spirit desires, they might kill ya
Our old mortars, talk out of street thesaurus
Take you into the chorus through the glass eye of Horus

[Interlude]
He had been the biggest juggernaut in human history, rolling over everything: over governmental form, over rituals, over religions casual and religions intense

[Verse 3: Virtuoso]
All religions fear Miguel
My strikes are fatal, to your style
That's infantile like prenatal
Your mic's a child that's getting fucked by a wild pedophile
With blond crests like [?] pectoral
So suck my genitals you punk bitch, I'm the general
Concocting verbs out of chemicals
Leave you bloody like menstrual
Cycles, my rap rifle blasts open any beat you throw
Virtuoso flows like an ocean through an archipelago

[Verse 4: Esoteric]
At a glance, yo, my battle stance rattles camps like an avalanche
Crabs don't have a chance, you sycophants
Spend your cash advance grabbin' a lance
To try to joust with the conqueror
Stompin' the pawns that sponsor ya, onto the crucifix
I chew ya crew to bits like Mueslix or computer chips
Who can diss the pugilist?
Rappers tried, and now they calcified up in formaldehyde
Your valves canals divide
I scalp hides, my names italicized to chastise
Replicants in Nexus 6's excellence
Present tense malevolence, devastating regiments
Ever since I supplied a diatribe of cyanide
You revised whom you idolize
I finalize death threats, you recollect the Esoteridactyl
Court is now in session, mothafucker, drop the gavel

[Verse 5: Bahamadia]
Knowledge is self taught to be defining me spiritual
[?]
Like oracles at Delphi when they're spoken to
Mortals refer to me as Hatshepsut
For exposing the secrets of the sands while I'm blessing you
My presence here is principle like Kemetic philosophies
Of reparations and for payment of stolen legacy
So hail, homie
To Army of the Pharoah
Like Ma'at I seek truth through the tarot
Choosing the teachings of 'Nezzar over that of the devil
And trading places with Sankofa to hear my ancestors echo
Commanding thoughts that [?] the facts
That led me to the holy near the temple of Karnak

[Outro]
The old voice did not completely mask an underlying violence
Knowing that such individuals would be linked by powerful bonding lines not readily available to the common awareness. Others might observe such linkages and plot the consequences, but the linked ones would dance to unconscious music
