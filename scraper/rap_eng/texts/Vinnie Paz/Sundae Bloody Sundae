[Chorus]
Saturday noon, with nothing to do, I hear his simple song
Cheer the children who catch him on the park
Watching kids crowd, gather around his ivory colored car
Creaks along and the ice cream man is gone

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, I'm the ice cream man, everything is for sale
The product ain't made for touchin' homie, this isn't braille
It's only a couple flavors if you need some tree
I got 2 for 3, money, if you need some D
You hear that song, pull up, we sellin' on the corner
And don't mind the smell little homie, that's ammonia
Oh that? That's a special flavor, comes from out Slavonia
The red tops cherry heads 'cause they look like begonia
The task force there, give me money then you go
'Cause this judge is tryna to give a brother 20 for an O
I got the plug but it's still a large fee
So why the fuck I charge you what he charge me
Back of the line little motherfucker, 'cause you stressin' me
How you gonna ask a master chef for his recipe?
And don't ask me what I do with the stash
'Cause the smallest bit of candy get you 2 and a half, yeah

[Chorus]
Saturday noon, with nothing to do, I hear his simple song
Cheer the children who catch him on the park
Watching kids crowd, gather around his ivory colored car
Creaks along and the ice cream man is gone

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, I'm the ice cream man, I'm connected for the re-up
But you gonna have to pay it after it's over like a prenup
We got the streetsweepers for the clean up
There's crema in the ice cream truck to cook the D up
The ice cream man kind of gully but he's smart
And cookin' what he cookin', that's a culinary art
If you hang around my truck you need to buy somethin'
Why you always hang around my truck and you don't buy nothin'
I ain't tryna to hurt nobody, I just want the dolla'
You lovin' these bitches homie, I just love my guala
My partner in the back cookin' the base
You hear that song homie, you should see the look on they face
This young bul always askin', "Why you pack the 50?!"
'Cause motherfuckers plottin' and these bitches act so diddy
Thinkin' the ice cream man stressful, is true
But I wouldn't be in business if it wasn't for you, yeah

[Chorus]
Saturday noon, with nothing to do, I hear his simple song
Cheer the children who catch him on the park
Watching kids crowd, gather around his ivory colored car
Creaks along and the ice cream man is gone
