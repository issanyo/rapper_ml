[Intro]
Die motherfuckers die - Scarface
AOTP shit nigga
Die, die, die
Die motherfuckers die - Scarface

[Verse 1: Planetary]
Top Gun of this rap shit
Cock guns to blast shit, nigga what's the meaning of that
Shit, scheming, a black Smith & Wesson, what's hood
I'm grown, now I gotta start protecting my goods
I gotta start protecting every one of my kids
I gotta start protecting everything I got in the crib (That's my shit)
I gotta have a fresh pair J's for the whizz
If not trees, if not that I ain't handle my bizz
A screwed up way to live
But that's me, follow my lead it is what it is (my niggas)
I hold steel in the hour of chaos
And hurdle through the base heads tryin' to just play with the odds
I'm not the type of nigga to claim god
But dog I heard you spit
Do't quit your day job
I've always been the cat to slave hard
Hoping that the dealer don't turn over the face card

[Verse 2: Doap Nixon]
Fuck the claps and cheers, all we want is respect
And ya'll fuckers are wild lame, yall ain't nothing to sweat, UH
Still certified greens and tan trees
Still in the hood like damp leaves and banshees
The last time they seen Vinnie Paz and kenny spaz
We was blazed up in a cab, waving a semi- mag
That was the time I dropped out of college
The god of law thought he would go on his own
Is still knowledge, knowledge
Kinda ridiculous the way I get in this shit
Some felt ignorant, me felt innocent
So for now on my gods you now strong
Niggas want war I get you murked by a wild jawn
The only reason I ain't on and my niggas is on
Is cuz I got stuck on the gold pot that I'm sitting on
Till I seen there wasn't nothing there
From my eyes to my ears I got stains of bloody tears

[Hook: Demoz]
AOTP, they know we be, O-N T-O-P
(Die mother fucker, die)
Fucking with these gentlemen, we run up in your residence, get you for your presidents
(Die mother fucker, die)
Make up the break up, I don't wanna wake up, If I don't got my cake up
(Die mother fucker, die)
AOTP, on top we be he he he he
(Die mother fucker, die)

[Verse 3: Demoz]
The psycho's back strong enough to push the Eifel back
Halloween mask, Michael's back
Stay in your lane, you no named niggas get lipo'd up
Lose weight when the rifle bust, I don't like you fucks
They want my life I want 5 mics, problem is I'm unsigned hyped
Fuck is the deal, give me life in the booth with no fucking appeal
I bet you my left lung they can't fuck with the skill
Bet you my right hand they gon' die in the trauma
It's the front street terrorist I ride like Osama
It's a thin line between a prick and a fool
But these faggots they keep acting like snitching is cool
Man these faggots they keep acting like I ain't a beast
Till their face is next to their sons under the beach
Food for the crabs mission accomplished nigga take it in blood
It's a wrap, my crew acting like Satan is loved

[Verse 4: Vinnie Paz]
I'm Jesus in reverse, the son of Satan with a fire arm
Water to blood, apocalyptic fire storm
You a sucka rapper, never know what side you on
I shoot my biscuit in the air until the sky is gone
A 16 of mine murder your entire song
9M submachine is long like your entire arm
I'm a loud mouth fucka not a quiet storm
I don't believe in an afterlife so once you die you gone
Never nothin soft, everythin' a violent song
Kanye West, gay rapper, thats when lines are drawn
Qwest hit me with a beat like he Italian mob
It ain't even beef no more, its Hillshire Farm
I ain't gonna leave your family any time to mourn
My clenched fist shows the power that's inside the palm
The same 'palm that was taking human lives in 'Nam
And I ain't stoppin it till' all these human lives are gone

[Hook: Demoz]
AOTP, they know we be, O-N T-O-P
(Die mother fucker, die)
Fucking with these gentlemen, we run up in your residence, get you for your presidents
(Die mother fucker, die)
Make up the break up, I don't wanna wake up, If I don't got my cake up
(Die mother fucker, die)
AOTP, on top we be he he he he
(Die mother fucker, die)

[Outro: Vinnie Paz]

The genocide general (motherfucker)
Doap Nix (AOTP)
