[Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah
Outerspace baby
It's Vinnie Paz
Blood and ashes
We came a long way, baby
Yo Planet
Tell these motherfuckers what the deal is cousin
Let em know daddy

[Verse 1: Planetary]
I wouldn't even know how to live this dream
Without my kids, my cream, my wiz, my team
Without a means of scheme no underground scene
No hustle, no struggle, or the shit in between
Without a fan base or stores that scan tapes
And it only make me stronger when another man hate
You can't escape, everything I spit 6 feet
And I bet you ain't think that I could get this deep
Let me explain: thoughts bringing treacherous pain
I'mma get these Bill Gates numbers next to my name
Even if it takes leaving niggas wet in the rain
I'mma aim at their hearts and souls to get fame
I'm an artist, starving it explains my reign
But I promise you motherfuckers that shit gon' change
We still, traveling through space and time
Same clique, same fam, same frame of mind
My lines crush, in hopes I'mma leave my mind plush
With diamonds plus I do it til my time is up
We attacking your region, it's massacre season
Warchild, where you at I'm only half of the reason

[Hook x2:]
We came a long way, been to space and back
From the hallways and right through the basement cracks
We're here to take over every place on the map
We some real rude niggas put your face on the map

[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
I wouldn't even know how to live my life
Without my kid, my wiz, my crib, my ice
Without my dick, my whip, no clip no knife
Without a chance to uplift and spit precise
It's a cold world, rocky road, don't roll the dice
If you can't lay the change on the table it's only right
I need one mic
One chance and one glance
One fight
One dance to become champ
Word to [?] Lyrical [?]
Verb vanisher swallow your fronts when I lose patience
My people say I need to chill, breathing stop
Homie I'd rather cleave your grill til the bleeding stop
And I'mma set freeze and chills til my sleeves is rocked
And I'mma proceed to build until I reach the top
Call it what you want, if you feel the need to plot
I got the perimeter locked from block to block
I spit sick literature, hot for you to cop
Fingertips on hollow cylinders cock to make you drop, bitch
I'm toxic, chemical warfare, beware
I'm frontline nigga, with one rhyme I'm there

[Hook x2:]
We came a long way, been to space and back
From the hallways and right through the basement cracks
We're here to take over every place on the map
We some real rude niggas put your face on the map

[Outro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah
It's fucking Outerspace
Raw shit, hardcore shit
What's the fucking deal
It's fucking Vinnie Paz baby
It ain't a game out here
AOTP, punching y'all in the fucking face
This shit is hardcore, out of my heart core
Na mean?
Blood and ashes
Crypt the Warchild
Planetary
AOTP
King Syze
What's the fucking deal?
Keep it moving baby
It's our motherfucking year
Y'all might as well fall the fuck back
Or face the fucking repercussions
It's fucking over x4
Yeah
You fucking crumbs, maggots, fucking worms, fucking noodles
Fuck ya'll
