Diabolic

Ahhh ha ha haaaa...
Diabolic / Vinnie Paz
Foul Play bitch!

[Verse 1 - Diabolic:]
I got Pope John Paul in his casket turnin'
When I’m at a catholic sermon, smashed with a flask of bourbon
Dashing in a black suburban, passing, swervin'
Crash n' burnin', like attacks from Iraq insurgents
But now I’m back determined to have some virgins
Taking face shots like Botox, I’m a plastic surgeon
Not your average person, coz' this cash I’m earnin'
Got me riding dirty like the mastered version of my tracks with cursing
The illest cat for certain, too perverted to mention
In a class by myself like internal suspension
I'm terminal spreadin' through you're chest and ribs
Till the song’s stuck in ya’ head and gives you less than a month left to live
Infect the kids, I love to poison minds
Got hoes bending over backwards like double jointed spines
I’m at the point in time where I don’t give a flying fuck
And if I get fired up you get you're jaw wired shut

And it's....

[Hook - Diabolic:]
Mic check, one, two, we back on the block again
Body in the trunk, somebody’s gettin' shot again
Fist full of haze, stomach full of Heineken
My bitch put the radio on, "No not again!"

We want that real shit, somethin’ i can feel shit
You know the gutter shit, fuck all that other shit
That go to war shit, kickin’ in the door shit
Diabolic, Vinnie Paz; yeah that raw shit

[Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz:]
Ayo D, you the foulest muthafucka around
Anyone who got a beef with us get stuck with the pound
That’s regardless if they hate us or fuck with the sound
And regardless if they're ravers or they come from up-town
I don't care who get stuck, black, white, Spanish, anybody
My weaponry a left buck and a mini shottie
I don't discriminate, Pazienza blazin' people
I kill you're dog and eat him up like i was Asian people
Me and Diabolic similar to haze and diesel
It's straight to the head and stick inside the veins of people
And Pazienza too intelligent, my brain'll eat you
My bitch stay strapped, even Vinnie’s dame is lethal
I did a little bid for taking fuckin change from people
But Diabolic did the muthafuckin same, we equal
That's why people call the two of us insanely evil
And that's why people call the two of us insanely evil

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Vinnie Paz:]
I scream "Allahu Akbar, murder murder, kill kill"
In the same sentence that's why I'm incredibly ill
We better rebuild, and put the muthafuckin pope in prison, (hahahaa)
For practicing remote control socialism
But i ain't mean to get political on this shit
So give me a forty-ouncer, pass the muthafuckin' buscuit
And do some type of shit i did that i don't wan' re-visit
You better tell the c-cypha that they gone need ballistics

[Verse 4 - Diabolic:]
So keep you distance, coz' me and Vinnie, we the sickest
We'll make you sleep with fishes like tsunamis from the East Pacific
I keep a spliff lit, guzzling this Belvedere
Chase it with a twelve of beer, and heaven fell, hell is here
Hell yeah i smell you're fear, and I'm you're fearless leader
With lyrics deeper than the crater left in Hiroshima
So if you love hip-hop but saw the spirit leave ya
Me and Vinnie thought we'd bring it back here to see'ya!

[Hook]
