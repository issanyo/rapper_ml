[Verse 1]
This the Official Pistol Gang, I put my mother on it
If I got beef, I ain’t got beef, my brother on it
I just punch you in the face for nothing, I love the conflict
And all my grown New York brothers be gunning Spofford
Vinnie God-sent, I’m what Allah meant
Gucci frames, wild nerdy, call him Clark Kent
Me and Jus sat together on the park bench
And said if it wasn’t money then it was nonsense
Keep steadily finding ways to stay better
You don’t fight, you ducking fights, you Mayweather
Anyway you wanna put it butcher, slay, sever
You looking like Eddie in Delirious, gay leather
You arguing over who the best is but it’s me though
I’m arguing over who was better Ozzy and Dio
Bruce Dickinson, Paul Di’Anno? Ay, dios mio
Mel Gibson a racist and Rick Ross is a CO

[Hook][x2]
One’s for more liquor, two’s for more liquor
Honestly it’s my everything, I adore liquor
One’s for more trees, two’s for more trees
Honestly it’s my everything, I adore trees

[Verse 2]
Yo there’s more to life than guns and pleasure
It’s just till I find something better
But I ain’t ever gonna find a trunk of sunken treasure
I’m a troublemaker, not a fucking double-major
I love being with slug-traders and drug-takers
I have an attitude, my gun has a gattitude
We ain’t trying to just have gas and fast food
I’m with high rollers and pistol holders
Gotta stay away from eye-rollers and whistle-blowers
If I ever come in contact with them motherfuckers
Contact a couple bloodsuckers and shovellers
I’m filled with the hate of jihadists and mass-murderers
Don’t affiliate with pickpockets and cat burglars
Gotta keep my guard up, had a lot of hard luck
All I got is money for the bars and Starbucks
But why spend cash on snacks and SunChips?
When I can spend a stack on gats and gun clips
