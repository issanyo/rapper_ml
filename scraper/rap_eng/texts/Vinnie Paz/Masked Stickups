[Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah
One Two
Yeah
Yo Stallone, I got 4 bars here or I got 8?
Aight
Aight look
Yeah
Check me out

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
I'm faithful to God, I'm so fuckin' faithful it hurt
That why every bar and every rhyme take 'em to church
And once the body drop it go straight to the earth
And how you understand clean if you ain't played in the dirt?
Look, let me put it to you simple and plain
How these hollow tips take you through the center of pain
? never talk to a fool
And vic gon' be a vic, off with the jewels
You could have it either way, pa Glock or the pump
Either way you gon' take these shots like a drum
Lucas weaponry, it's all types of shit I could get
It's mad body parts, all types shit I could hit
I got airplane, all type of shit I could get
Then there's rocket fuel, all types of shit I could flip
And ya'll gonna have to accept the God sickenin'
Aim the shwammy, its gonna splash 'em like Rod Strickland

[Chrous]
I could have your mans disappear if I wanted to
Funny how shit seem clear when the gun at you
Brrrrrrr stick up, ha ha ha, stick up
Brrrrrrr stick up, ha ha ha, stick up
I could have your mans disappear if I wanted to
Funny how shit seem clear when the gun at you
Brrrrrrr stick up, ha ha ha, stick up
Brrrrrrr stick up, ha ha ha, stick up

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
20 plus years and still invincible
You ain't get touched for what you did, it's the principle
I don't bridge gaps cuz the gap is unbridgeable
Theoretically the probability conditional
Don't bring shirk around here, it's not permissible
Actin' like my place in the game isn't pivotal
Faith called faith cuz it isn't too visible
Conflict stem from stolen Aplican mineral
Cousin where you at?
I see 'em, I got a visual
The horror I'mma bring to his out-of-body is criminal
No matter how hard you try, you not at the pinnacle
All bark and no bite, you too typical
Celebrate mediocrity and do the minimal
Everything come back round, it's too cyclical
You don't get the raw anymore, that's additional
The co-price high and the body count biblical

[Chorus]
I could have your mans disappear if I wanted to
Funny how shit seem clear when the gun at you
Brrrrr stick up, ha ha ha, stick up
Brrrrr stick up, ha ha ha, stick up
I could have your mans disappear if I wanted to
Funny how shit seem clear when the gun at you
Brrrrr stick up, ha ha ha, stick up
Brrrrr stick up, ha ha ha, stick up
