[Intro: Charlie Manson]
I run the underworld, guy
I decide who does what and where they do it at
Why am I gonna run around and act like I'm some teeny-bopper somewhere for somebody else's money?
I make the money, man. I roll the nickels. The game's mine. I'm the king!

[Hook: Block McCloud]
Gotta get fetti, gotta get that dough
Please don't hate me cause I hustle and it's all I know
We get fetti man, we get that flow
They hate us because we love paper chasing
Gotta get fetti, gotta get that dough
Please don't hate me cause I hustle and it's all I know
We get fetti man, we get that flow
They hate us because we love paper chasing

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
I'm the man with the plan and them rocks in my hand
In the Cadillac sitting on the fours
All the boppers so heavy but the haters mad at me
When I come around the corner so slow
I'm the shit where I'm from in the land of Screw
A go-getter chasing after bankrolls
If you're hating; don't try it cause I'm waiting so quiet
A player stay up on his toes
I got my mind on paper, not concerned with them haters
Them boys is talking down call me catch up later
See I pull up in that black on black like Darth Vader
Handing bars out the window, serving boys like a waiter
My mind on dollar signs so partner I'mma grind
Gotta punch that clock and paper-chase overtime
That paper is a fool if you put in work
I'mma hustle 'till I'm under the dirt, I gotta get it baby

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
I'm nice with the ox, you get cut like the raw white
Or hit you with a fucking silver bullet like Coors Light
I could tell a snitch if he don't walk through the door right
I could tell a snitch if he don't handle the four right
The fifth levitate your body to Godâ€™s height
Flatline, long dark tunnel and saw light
I'ma ride dirty so motherfucker forget the law
Chicken wing, shrimp, fried rice from the liquor store
It don't take a lot for me to have the pistol drawn
Get popped in front of me, I don't even assist the boy
Y'all are fronting, I don't know what the resistance for
Y'all are nothing, that's why that you keep you distance for
Anybody fuck with Vinnie getting laid to waste
I'ma have your white tee looking like it's tomato paste
You a joker, motherfucker, Vinnie play the ace
Paul, take the thirty-eight snub and rearrange his face

[Hook: Block McCloud]
Gotta get fetti, gotta get that dough
Please don't hate me cause I hustle and it's all I know
We get fetti man, we get that flow
They hate us because we love paper chasing
Gotta get fetti, gotta get that dough
Please don't hate me cause I hustle and it's all I know
We get fetti man, we get that flow
They hate us because we love paper chasing
Paper chasing
They hate us because we love paper chasing
Gotta get fetti, gotta get that dough
They hate us because we love paper chasing
Paper chasing
Paper chasing
