[Intro]
Yeah, one two, yeah, pistol pazzy, aight look

[Verse 1]
Elect of Allah, third king, Solomon that
The .50 Cal break your cartilage where collagen at
Shots have him face down like a Klonopin pack
They will hit you if you have a fucking problem with that
I'm where they hollerin at
Where that joey crack cook coke bubbling at
I'm successful and there's people having trouble with that
That self pity you accustomed to, well wallow in that
Money, power, respect that's the key to success
This thing long King Kong when he beating his chest
The further into the abyss, the deeper it's depths
I killed a Devil last night God, The Reaper is next
You glorify snitches and you giving information
You a vic and I will Jerk a chicken like Jamaicans
If I had power to bring you back from the dead
I'll bring him back from the dead, so I could clap at his head

[Hook]
I'm the ultimate 16 bar machine
The God of war, the M16, the high chief
I'm the ultimate 16 bar machine
The God of war, the M16, the high chief

[Verse 2]
The Truck Jewelry amazin ain't it
Divine the principles of the Ma'at and ancient Kemet
The breath of god we initiates of basic ????
It's the dragon and it's war and it's Satans pivot
I break laws while you bending the rules
I shoot mafuckas you just get suspended from school
If you take ten steps and draw, then it's a duel
How you learn to be a man under a tenuous rule?
And my homie from the south came through in a slab
Shotgun pump looking like I'm doing a dab
I will kick the door down catch you in the lab
Then tell the coroner that he know what to do with the task
I did some stupid shit and wrestle with bids
I'm a professional, you don't know what professional is
The gun connoisseur don't ask me who got blickies
Pull up like them young Pirus when they popped Rickey

[Hook]
I'm the ultimate 16 bar machine
The God of war, the M16, the high chief
I'm the ultimate 16 bar machine
The God of war, the M16, the high chief
