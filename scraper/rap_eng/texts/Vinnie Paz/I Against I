[Verse 1: Planetary]
In my historical oracle, I blast metaphorical
Editorials educatin' in my territorial
Get torn, heavily armed with seventy bombs
That'll blast divine like the heavenly psalm
Your men'll be gone if they explore my deepest thought
I beat hearts in two, then ask demons for chalk
I'm dreamin' to stalk emcees in the dark
I walk blindfolded, the mind's golden, watch how you talk
My style is a art, recognize lyrical purity
All hell breaks loose like a mall with no security
The dopest vocalist, with my third eye I focus with
I proceed, flow with the speed of a Indie motorist
There's more to this than wasted shiny chains and bracelets
I hit tracks, my tongue waits for the brains to blaze it
Amazin' angelic, tell it to your people
("Your mic and my mic, come on, yo, no equal")

[Hook]
Illadelph is like the Sun, 'cause we shine with rhymes
The underground is like the Moon: you only see us at times
And at times with light skies when the stars recline
Jedi Mind, Outerspace, coincide and combine

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
Raw poems, bury your body in catacombs
Rip your soul from your limbs like brims from Jim Jones
In the Twilight Zone we disperse cowards
Vampires that stalk earth on reverse hours
Night calls, we target your facade
My latitude is God, darts out my jaws leave eternal scars
You're left breathin' out of tube straws by the marksmen
Harnessin' science for demolishin' the charlatan
Raps will make you parallax
My domain has power to block synapse inside veins
War shots fired off by the army type warlocks
Devil's plan is to have you drip in the Clorox
Beast deceivin' us, ways devious
Possessin' my peeps to walk streets
With stolen heat, like Prometheus
Elements rushin' you back to hell again
Illadelphians crush your skeleton to fuckin' gelatin

[Hook]
Illadelph is like the Sun, 'cause we shine with rhymes
The underground is like the Moon: you only see us at times
And at times with light skies when the stars recline
Jedi Mind, Outerspace, coincide and combine

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
Don't ever come to me with war
I've severed scores of orators
Rappers fall onto all fours like minotaurs
With Jedi Mind and the Planetary be bombin' this
We stand one step above you like a pharmacist
With Ominous, detonate the bomb
Heads dread hallucinogenics since Vietnam
I spit a psalm, create bombs like an Iraqi
Swear on the Bible and then lie to Ecclesiastes
(Assault and battery)
Battle me, that'll be what splits you
Store enormous amounts of energy in a crystal
We boa constrict you, the gods are militant
You faggots couldn't go the length like you was impotent
You ignorant, your whole clique is split in half
You step in Allah path, and face Allah wrath, what!

[Hook]
Illadelph is like the Sun, 'cause we shine with rhymes
The underground is like the Moon: you only see us at times
And at times with light skies when the stars recline
Jedi Mind, Outerspace, coincide and combine
