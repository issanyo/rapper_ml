Fuck the machine, I’m raging against the broke life
I love the cream, my sayings affect the coke price
My demons are devils to the things that I don’t like
Can I detach myself from 'em I know it’s so trife
Murder assault, wild out of control type
Worshiping at the altar of Ralph like a low life
Dress correct, heavy metal emperor roll tight
I’m obsessed with death, helter skelter like Sean Price
Know the tech kid the sound of thunder
No respectable Boba Fett like bounty hunter
No remorse, mega force records seek and destroy
We kill em all, zip up the bag, bring em to the morgue
Bring him to the coroner table then cut him up and look inside of him
What the fuck would they think if someone lied to them?
Sold em the dead dreams, listening to philosophers
Going against me? Victory is impossible

[Hook x2]
Blood, money and death, dark side justice
Trust nothing except, dark side justice
Fuck love and respect, dark side justice
120% dark side justice

My rap’s scary, it escaped from my Blackberry
Your rap stays trapped, it’s fake and imaginary
My rap full of gats and bad vocabulary
My rap has drug tracks and blood capillaries
It’s all cemetery, and about mortuaries
I ain’t saying anything out of the ordinary
Not unusual, it’s the cult itinerary
Attending funerals with a dull contemporary
Weapons put you in blessings whenever necessary
Gun straightened paper better than a secretary
With just one shot turn a jock into a Jerry
The Glocks that we carry, turn The Rock into a fairy
Murder for no reason other than monetary
The devil made me do it, it’s involuntary
I keep clips and newspaper obituaries
Behind a bookcase with a trick dictionary

[Hook x2]
Blood, money and death, dark side justice
Trust nothing except, dark side justice
Fuck love and respect, dark side justice
120% dark side justice

It’s a perfect murder scene, a perfect murder about a perfect person
Brujeria verse perfectly cursing a virgin
What’s the faculty of energy perfect exertion
Call me majesty, my words are conversed in a serpent
Pussy boy left the war, they call it desertion
I am dirty, I am opposite in every detergent
If it isn't a Grey Goose then it’s certainly Bourbon
I write my rhyme in Beirut with a burgundy turban
Hard body rap, punch you in the chatter box
I would never walk the hallways unless I had a ox
That’s the reason why they put me in padded box
I would’ve never been a problem if I had my pops
I pull a motherfuckers card like a magic shop
Mossberg means spin several metal savage shots
The heater hit the fuckin flesh like the cattle prod
My physical body’s the vehicle for wrath of God

[Hook x2]
Blood, money and death, dark side justice
Trust nothing except, dark side justice
Fuck love and respect, dark side justice
120% dark side justice
