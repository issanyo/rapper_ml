[Verse: Vinnie Paz]
Any time I pull the hammer out, I was usually Glock
It's usually cocked, it's usually for shooting at cops
I would like to say I'm sober, but I'm usually not
Usually at the bar with bitches, they salute me a lot
And they like to argue whether they are groupie or not
Tell me that they intellectual and school me a lot
Listen bitch, I ain't sayin' if you stupid or not
You just barkin' up the wrong tree, move it or stop
I was reading Nabokov, while you was groovin' to pop
I was selling nickel bags and was a student of Pac
I was watching Kubrick movies, I was shootin' a lot
Had to lie to my mama, wasn't truthful a lot
You was stupid, thought a Bud deuce-deuce was a lot
And I never thought a whole bottle of Goose was a lot
You decide if I'm drunk or that I'm lucid or not
I just know that I'm smarter than you, and the proof in the pot, stupid!
