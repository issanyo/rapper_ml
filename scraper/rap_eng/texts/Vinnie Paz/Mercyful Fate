[Intro: Sample]
Such a metal could come only from the future!
But the grim mystery still remains...
What forebodes when the world of tomorrow steals from today?

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
The best way to protect your seed from a school shooter is to make him a shooter too
So he can blaze and cruise through
It was all fun and games until Marvin got shot in the face
Run your chain and you're poppin' the safe
Man make elaborate plans and God laughs
The angel of death lurk in the shadows of God's wrath
Release them soul chasers on you, get your life snatched
Resurrect you from death to haunt you in your nightmares
My killers work cheap, space cadets, fifty bucks
Buck-fifty you fucks, crazier than any angel dust you can trust
I drop acid with Manson, smoke Kush with Koresh
Sniff coke with Pablo, fuck with me you fucking with the best
Seen bar brawls turn to shoot-outs turn to funerals
Leave you slumped over in your Subaru
You can't destroy energy, therefore you can't destroy God
It's Ill Bill, the overlord, Voivod
Listen

[Chorus: Ill Bill]
I'd rather turn in my grave than turn into a slave
Words of the saint, burned at the stake, mercyful fate
Death to false metal, a smirk on a murderers face
Vermin and jakes, hurt you for cake, mercyful fate
Dino De Laurentiis' Conan's surgical blade
Murderers spray, show a parade, mercyful fate
Rappers here, metal always be my personal taste
Churches aflame, virtues astray, mercyful fate

[Verse 2: Goretex]
American band stand
Selling bundles out of camp stands
William Cutting with buzz saws
Bodies in trash cans
Up in your spot usher mask and [?]
Disrespect the set of my fucking fed from rivers edge
Same cat up in the Van Halen painter's cap
Jordan Maxwell hold gats
I deal with ancient facts
Years and the millions in the west resilience
Killing your self to live
Only death come brilliance
Military [?]
Underground MK and drug departments
Running like [?]
Tarnished from carnage [?]
[?]
The coke is great, frozen when she sniff some more
I keep a bloody hammer like the one from Kill 'Em All

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
I asked my man where he been at
He told me that the policia bugged him like an insect
I told him that's what happens to you stupid cause you've been lax
But I've been on my deen ahki, trying to master syntax
This ain't a drop of water, this a fucking impact
Put him in a box like where he confess his sins at
You gon' take an L, it's no way you could prevent that
This big three-eighty carry bodies like a kidnap
What you call apocalypse is what I call a setback
I was too caught up in myself to ever wet that
Ill Bill saved me and I could never forget that
He and niece? saw me dying and they wouldn't let that
They told me if I wanna find a queen to go to left rap
But I don't need the hassle in my life so I'ma dead that
It's war inside my head you couldn't possibly end that
The aim sturdy, pop his fucking top like it's a pen cap

[Chorus: Ill Bill]
I'd rather turn in my grave than turn into a slave
Words of the saint, burned at the stake, mercyful fate
Death to false metal, a smirk on a murderers face
Vermin and jakes, hurt you for cake, mercyful fate
Dino De Laurentiis' Conan's surgical blade
Murderers spray, show a parade, mercyful fate
Rappers here, metal always be my personal taste
Churches aflame, virtues astray, mercyful fate
