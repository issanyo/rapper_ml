[Vinnie Paz]
Yeah yeah, the Pazmanian devil
(yeah peoples) Outerspace
(yeah) the fuckin' Warchild
Planetary (yeah, yeah)

[Planetary]
One for the blood, two for the ashes
Three for that new, Outerspace shit classic
Nigga we fantastic, we rhyme masters
I throw lines faster than Mcnab passes (what)
Pass the cup - we start actin' up
I'm a Philly nigga for life, you ain't half as tough
You tried to, shit on the clan only pissed on ya hand
Now that's what the fuck, you get thinkin' you bigger than Fam'
It's Planetary, doggy I can promise I'm vicious
I make ya momma a witness, I vomit on bitches
Rhymes is explicit, real like Haley's comets that visit
Bombs in ya district, similar to Gandhi wit' vision
Explosive shit, and 16s the most you get
You want more you gotta pay, I'm an emotional wreck
The notion of step, is jus' like that moment you slept
You got severed, you should o' never came close to this mess

[Hook]
Y'all can't, we can (singing)
Fall down it's the army - STAND UP!
We came to snatch the crown
And our whole click will (singing)
Fuck around it's the army cocksucker
From Philly to Chi-town
Y'all can't, we can (singing)
Fall down it's the army - STAND UP!
We came to snatch the crown
And our whole click will (singing)
Fuck around it's the AOTP
From Philly to Chi-town

[Crypt the Warchild]
Yo, yo
I came in the game hungry, young buck new jack
Stated my name, and now I abuse raps
Your cranium drained, when I crush ya melon
In the middle of broad day, who the fuck is tellin'?
Outrageous haters, can't contain us
Chickenheads play the side, givin' neck and brain
Ah, rip to shred any track, just by shoutin' phrases
For niggas rockin' backpacks or locked in cages
Whether you clap gats in the blocks, contagious
From rottenest days, boxed in a maze, Lord save us!
Ready for war, with a long machete or sword
Blades of glory will change my story nigga I'm pure
Uncut, bar 16s on triple beams - untouched
The thud alone will cripple fiends
Who want what? - bars explode across the globe
Who jump up? - wit' garbage flows hit the road

[Hook]
Y'all can't, we can (singing)
Fall down it's the army - STAND UP!
We came to snatch the crown
And our whole click will (singing)
Fuck around it's the army cocksuckers
From Philly to Chi-town
Y'all can't, we can (singing)
Fall down it's the army - STAND UP!
We came to snatch the crown
And our whole click will (singing)
Fuck around it's the AOTP
From Philly to Chi-town

[Vinnie Paz]
(Yeah yeah)
Machine gun rap and animal rap, we similar
A bunch of sick fucks like Caligula
Cut you up and spit on ya, carve a Jedi Mind insignia
On ya fuckin' spine, I'm divine rhyme cinema
Put an ice pick in ya, turn into beast
If you fuckin' with my mother brother nephews and niece
The attitude I have on the streets is no peace
That's why I'm always aiming my piece at police
But I don't even want no beef, wit y'all 5-0
That's why I visited four mosques in Cairo
That's why I study the God's thoughts in Heiro'
So I can avoid the cop hot shots that are hollow
The same ones that they put in Amadou Diallo
I'mma start a fucking revolution, y'all follow
The military is disposable - that's hypocrisy
And I'm about to kill ~~~~~ who's stoppin' me?!?
