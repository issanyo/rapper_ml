[Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, yo
Yo, Mr. Benton, it's a pleasure doing business with you, papa
Yo, Kato, what's up?
Yo, Mr. Benton, when you come to Philly, I got the AR-15s
The M4A1 carbines, the Barrett REC7s, the Bushmasters
The Floro PDWs, the Robinson Armament XCRs
You know what I'm saying? I'm a gun motherfucker
This is how we gon' get down though right now

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Your liver taste exquisite with Chianti
The uppercut is so vicious that it could lift a donkey
I pop pills and cop killed, the visions haunt me
Kill him, then bring him back to life and forgive a zombie
Load the shotty up and hit him in the prison lobby
The closest thing you got to pussy is doing bitches laundry
You's a sucker, motherfucker and that should alarm me
You ain't carrying hammers, you a fictitious army
Y'all make Drake look hard body, that shit appall me
And my money astronomical like Dennis Garvey
Unless you want your fucking head shattered, get up off me
I'm about to break fool on you, catch a homi'
Pull the motherfucking biscuit out and catch a body
Italian luxury and I ain't talking Maserati
The fist hit you dead in the chest, the kamikaze
The flying monkey is Ozbourne like I was Ozzy

Boxcutter Pazzy
Yo, Mr. Benton
Kato, what up?

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, all I need is one mic, three syringes and two rocks
I rap like I got Pac's dead corpse in a shoe box
I'm a retard, Jarren stay on that stupid shit
So disrespectful I slap Christ off the crucifix
I go to your funeral and punch the eulogist
Papa used to tell me that rapping ain't fucking lucrative
That's foolishness dad, you sound ludicrous
Fuck your opinion, goddamn it, we 'bout to do this shit
Boxcutter hooligan, look what this blade'll do to him
Fuck a fifth of Henny, I could chug a whole pool of Gin
Kill him then I stand over his body then I shoot again
Fuck coke, get high off of pesticides and fumigants
I'm an animal, I grew up in the pits of hell
I'm strong enough to punch through the ocean and fucking kill a whale
Scalpels and all sorts of assortments
Bitch, I'm a pimp, I can sell shit to a toilet
So scram with your faggot ass, don't make me let the semi blast
Fuck a gun, don't make me pop the trunk and pull out Vinnie Paz
Y'all some homos, rappers talking 'bout fanny bags
Keep the conversation brief, but we ain't talking clinic ash
Just read a shitty comment, now my day is ruined
You 'bout as gay as a B2K reunion
I'm an innovator, give a shit what they were doing
Rotting flesh pollutes my back yard, so now my neighbors moving
Adidas on my feet, it's never Reeboks
Hopsin say he dropping his album right after Detox
I'm into bestiality, getting head from an Ewok
You niggas got it fucked up like a blood trying to C-walk
I throw you off a tree top in a Chevy bumping Pete Rock
Bitch, I'm off the wall just like fucked up Sheetrock
Doctor Lecter, I eat you, rappers get Ethered
Been the shit since papa skeeted me out his urethra, bitch
