[Intro]

Let’s face it, someone in the CIA who has commanded wars around the world, sent people off to die which is the, you know, is the ultimate ego trip for a Pentagon type of person. The ultimate power that a human being can have is to send other humans off to die. Not to send just one individual to the gas chamber but send five thousand off to die

[Verse 1:Ill Bill]

When your army approaches my castle
They see the decapitated heads of my enemies
Stabbed and hanging from every branch in every tree
The destiny of the truth is to be hidden
Yet the truth is right in front of your eyes, it’s written
Rituals of the forbidden, nerf herders cast spells during black metal church murders
Nerds with burners, beware of virgin murderers
Perverted ones, inverted nuns, fun with lysergic drugs
An orgy of the damned in the church of love
A thunder clap comparable to the burst of guns
Get your fucking face blown off by the inertia pulse
Murder cult burn-n-blow, vertigo, hollow tips insertable
Pop your head open like a convertible
A cross between Charles Bronson and Fred Williamson
Fuck with me, car bombings and dead stick-up kids
The Devil feasts upon the souls of cowards
Horrifying like golden showers and exploding towers, listen

[Hook: ILL BILL & Vinnie Paz]

Stumbled to the end of the tunnel but didn’t see light
Machine gun-toting Levites, suicidal Sunnis, exploding Shiites
The holy man swore he seen Christ
And yet still he craves to take his enemy’s life

Yo, stumbled to the end of the tunnel but didn’t see light
Machine gun-toting Levites, suicidal Sunnis, exploding Shiites
The holy man swore he seen Christ
And yet still he craves to take his enemy’s life

[Verse 2:Vinnie Paz]

Who built the pyramids in Georgia? Malachi York and they extort him
They took the fucking facts and they distort em
I’m the fucking horseman, I draw a line in the sand
Another order of the Sufis out of Sudan
Yeah that doesn’t mean that I’m an honourable man
It means that understanding understood and I understand
Yeah have understanding of Leviathan plan
Have understanding of the dying of man
Y’all gonna push the god, make him turn into a goon
Have me turning into Abraham and worshipping the moon
Put a spell on your son, curse him in the womb
Go to Hell with the nuns, they perverted too
Yeah it’s only mathematics spit
I speak ancient Greek and Galilean and Arabic
I read the revised Koran, Circle Seven
The God degree inside me and my brethren

[Hook: ILL BILL & Vinnie Paz]

Stumbled to the end of the tunnel but didn’t see light
Machine gun-toting Levites, suicidal Sunnis, exploding Shiites
The holy man swore he seen Christ
And yet still he craves to take his enemy’s life

Yo, stumbled to the end of the tunnel but didn’t see light
Machine gun-toting Levites, suicidal Sunnis, exploding Shiites
The holy man swore he seen Christ
And yet still he craves to take his enemy’s life
