*Ladies and Gentlemen*
*Y'all better listen to this*

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Yo, yo, I'm Jesus, my right hand writes diseases
My left hand will strike and fight ya weakness
I'm covered in blood wherever the feast is
Find me covered in blood wherever police is
I'm covered in blood wherever your niece is
I'm covered in mud from burying heaters
Vinnie Paz fuck whoever Vinnie Paz pleases
Hit you in the chest till you don't even know what breathe is
We demons, with blood-lust for heathens
Born through a storm on a sea with Galileans
In cold regions, we rocking it well
And that's why every fucking time I drop and it sell
And that's why every fucking time I'm dropping a shell
And that's why every fucking time I pop and you yell
Mock you in hell, you motherfuckers can't stop us
You more overhyped than Elián González

[Hook x2: Vinnie Paz]
Ayo, we speak now or forever hold our piece
A-O-T-P, shook rappers call police
*I'm savage, I'm-I'm-I'm savage*
*I write rhymes in pitch blackness*

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
Yo, yo, I dump you like candle wax
You a waist/waste product like fanny packs
I handicap give panic attacks like anthrax
You catch a, foreign disease like overseas
Fuck foreign emcees I bring Thor to his knees
I'm a master like Fard, I bombard and blast hard
We thrash thoughts some ask God you bas-tard
It's the rap ji-had, you a re-tard
I'm rollin' through Islamabad like this is my backyard
You ready, I'm heavy like the case of Chandra Levy
Tapin' that you crazy
Seven thirty bug when you actually one eighty, a half way thug
Yo my act stay drugged off dope tracks and raps
Girls with nice racks an two hundred dollar hats
It's the world I can't escape
My brain's curlin' great weight
"This shit is sick", yeah I'd make a greatest hits
But I can't fit every verse I ever spit on one disc
Cats talk shit this is what they get
A grand prize two black eyes and a busted lip
And for being rude we include a brutal beatin'
I'll have you eatin' food through a feedin' tube as you're retreating

[Hook x2]

[Apathy talking]
Alright alright hold up hold up settle down
Listen up you motherfuckers
This the last time you gonna hear me like this shit
So I'ma show you why I'm the king of this shit
Apathetic

[Verse 3: Apathy]
Enhanced tactical fightin' machinery
Combattin' on army scenery
Strategic-ly movin' my mics like Stratego
I generate graphics like Neo Geo
Flyin' science I incite riots try it's why it's
Violence at maximum levels
The difference of angels and devils
Rectangles and circles, techs fatal to murder
Techniques unheard of, next week I'm famous
Great as the latest with the upper hand like four aces
In poker approachin' jokers lock I load and stroke the trigger
Thirty eight calibre bullets travel through barrels
Rippin' through apparel parallel to where medics will sterile scapels
Dwellin' swellin' organs of felons bullets obliterate melons, with ease
Police yell freeze, ease the gun down
Under the influence of trees alleyways I run down
Pantin' and handlin' mechanical weapons I'm brandishin'
Fleein' foreign in areas I camouflage to vanishin'
Release the dogs, sounds of hounds pound my eardrums
Here comes a fearsome doberman poke him in his cerebrum
I'm almost free, around the tree I glance advancin'
Slowly cautiously awkwardly while negotiators talk to me
To dark I see the light, but not the squad car
It's comin' from the sky bright green, what an odd star
The odds are I blast off barely a clip
But then I noticed the strange star was an alien ship
Just as the bullet grazed my temple, the ship shot out a beam
It was green and it paralyzed the whole SWAT team
Cops floated in the air and their weapons disassembled
I trembled for my metal but I'm frozen in the mental
Unaware that I was in control of the ships in the air
And how the cops turned if they ever returned
If their bodies burn like candles on a mantle in a urn
I forced 'em to learn I played God like George Burns
