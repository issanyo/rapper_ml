[C.Kamachi talking]
Yeah, A.O.T.P., come on
Underground legends, yeah
Yeah Army Of The motherfuckin' Pharaohs
What I'm sayin', independent
Warriors takin' over the game
What I'm sayin' it's time for y'all to lay down
And I'm sayin' we back, it been to long
What I'm sayin', the deer hunter's here

[Verse 1: C.Kamachi]
Ain't no need to know my ethno, cause worldwide is where my respect go
My flow is multi-spectral, like I'm space based on LSD in trance state dancin' techno
Tellin' y'all haters to let go
It's enough beef but we vegetarian observe the spiritual laws
Purify ya channels and clearly hate ya flaws
So I wouldn't have to convince you that you wack and shouldn't be here at all
Kamachi's this and that I hear it all
I see you run from ya squad screamin' I wasn't even there wit y'all
I start wars with the tongue like it's a lesbian alm
Talk with that Thesbian charm
And you can let ya stereos amp this
It's the old english, pamphlets of a hoodlum Hamlet
Under literary FBI cameras candid, daddy
(yeah, Ha ha ha ha shit is child's play man)

[Hook: Crypt the Warchild]
Don't let ya life be the aim of pure misery
Don't let this knife keep ya frame on floors shivering
This pain and strife can no longer exist to me
Don't be the cause of an unsolved mystery
(2X)

[Verse 2: King Syze]
I'm an assault author, shockin' volts mixed with water
Disturbin' the law and order when I'm ballin' for the future
We them better kids, rap flows throughout my heritage
And let it live you reppin' shit where's the evidence
All I see and hear is poison in my ears
I kill a track, choke slam the snare
And let the sample live another day
Save it for another chase hunt it down with my brothers Outerspace
Tried once but my career's built off anger
I'm bout to leave these raps alone and load bangers
It's just the words from a slave rapper
Tryna bring the game back talkin' to the same master
I'm takin' a stand, my shit expands beyond makin' a band
That talks and storms upon forsaken lands
So when approachin' bring your best shit wit you
When I break it down you can take the rest wit you word

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
Yeh this is bars of death, we merkin' everybody God is next
Vicious raw literatures pure as Ghandi's flesh
Bomb to the chest, let ya breath cave in
A heart attack to bring the horror back Wes Craven
It make no sense waitin', the team risen
Like Pakistan and India liberated by Britain
We got rid of dead weight the vision's sharp and cleaner
Like the assassination attempt in Cartagena
We like a zombie feature, cause it ain't nothin' sweet
And it ain't nobody that's fuckin' with us on the street
We reinventin' the wheel cousin the cycle dead
We push the rock and we buck like we Michael Redd
I gave you life instead, gave you rice and bread
I think it's time that I separate the disciple head
That's probably the only thing that can calm me
Vinnie Pazzienza it's the motherfuckin' Army

[Hook]
