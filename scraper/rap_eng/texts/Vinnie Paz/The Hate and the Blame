[Verse 1: Apathy]
I keep it dirty like Louisiana swamp rats
Bikers with the jail tats
Undiscovered body in the house so the mail stacks
Stale Ap, fuck hailing Satan, I'll impale him in Salem Mass
Compared to me, the Devil is trailer trash
God awful apostle, fossilized
These know-it-all mahfuckers trying to philosophize
Bunch of Youtube scholars
Swear they kicking it deep as Genius
Theories of the Illuminati and Jesus
Please bitch, you brand new, New Jack amateur
Back in '94 me and Vin was studying the Urantia
Holy tabernacles, Zecharia Sitchin
You bullshit, admit your fact written was straight fiction

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
E.S. can make it happen
Blatantly breaking your back and
Rappers are fake when they're clapping
Cartridges this artist is a narcissistic arsonist
Carcasses start to decompose
We throw 'em in ocean for the shark and fish to gargle with
This sword, I sharpen this, no Excalibur but never tarnishes
I'll bring the carnage to your cartilage, you want no parts of this
No, the most arrogant character causing massacre, laugh at ya
I'm the last of cast since the Perriah
A rap critter's messiah, the glass prism reflection of that wisdom
So cold the water froze at my baptism
But I'll still burn you quicker than my skin in Africa
Attach you to a catheter, AOTP ambassador

[Hook: Lawrence Arnell] {x2}
Artillery stop enemies, got plenty
You're not killing anything with the shots you're sending
Crush ya bus pipes, you can hear the metal bending
(The Army's here)
There can only be one ending

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
Everybody hit the floor, y'all don't got a choice
I hit hard like the bass that was in my father's voice
I ain't soft, [I'm intense] if a rock god anoints
Often wrong, never in doubt like Donny Deutsch
See I was robbing motherfuckers, a taker of things
The star chaser, a law of nature, maker of wings
Empire of Egypt with your critical thinking
It was never the fetus of physical sinking
Seek truth find knowledge and became wisdom
Accurately accepting from the same prism
I'm the man behind the number what the game missing
Peace to all of my brothers that's in the state prison

[Verse 4: Crypt The Warchild]
I would never lay lifeless across the gurney
I would never flip flop go topsey turvey
That audible shit I do it cold turkey
You will never air me out or do me dirty
I'll bring the hurricane to you like I was Testaverde
Niggas extra thirsty, love to beg for mercy
I don't stress no bird, they do not concern me
Paz flex the thirty, eight to stretch they jersey
And they all play dumb like they ain't heard of me
So I'ma murder them before they murder me
Can't paint the town red cause all I see is burgundy
So if you see me on the strip it's an emergency

[Verse 5: Lawrence Arnell]
If I said it once I said it a thousand times
You couldn't see me if I let you spit a thousand rhymes
A cloud of smoke, the only thing I left behind
Come after mine, I protect it with that black iron
It ain't about a punchline when it's crunch time
It's all about the moonlight then the sunshine
Cause when it's dark out
And the hawks out
Them hammer jammers go bananas for your parka ock
Don't get your life took
Don't get your wife took
She'd rather be with me I can tell it just by the look
Been living by the book
Pharaoh in the big city
I don't survive I thrive I am one of many

[Hook]
