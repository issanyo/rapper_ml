[Verse 1: Demoz]
Hold up nigga, pass the weed, let me roll up nigga
I'll leave your eyes swolled up nigga
I'm from the city where the murders don't go down
They go up nigga, in the car where I blow up niggas
Give a fuck if your kid is riding witchu, he gon' blow up witcha
Bet a bird for a battle, I'mma show up quicker
Cut a bird into half, you get burnt for your stash
Bet money, no drugs, you get burnt for your cash nigga
I'll burn your fucking face to the ass
Put the ash in the urn and put the fucking urn in the trash
Shoot your man in the head till he swerve and he crash
Then run up on him with the burner out
Show him what the burner 'bout
Now he's back to the county over nothing
And my man, he in the Audi
With a fatty and a bucket of that Jose Cuervo
The xanies and the dutchess got me feeling like I can't no more
Vinnie, fuck 'em

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
It's blood everywhere, I can hardly see through the gun smoke
Bush got the streets fucked up, brothers dumb broke
I ain't even got to be upset to get son poked
I don't get my hands dirty, G, that's for young folk
I don't get my hands dirty at all
I don't think you motherfuckers even worry to brawl
We certainly ball, we certainly absurdly raw
We would purposely refer you to the surgery floor
And let you die muhfucker, we don't care 'bout you
Let my cousin Demoz squeeze the air out you
Run the chain, faggot, beat the Nike Airs out you
My hands sharp and fast, I'll beat the hairs out you
I'm just something you could never contain
I'm just something that could pray and bring a heavily rain
Allahu Akbar, heavenly plain
Allahu Akbar, heavenly plain
