[Verse 1: Des Devious]
It’s Des, you know the nigga that’ll never spit a whack rhyme
I’m too devoted on the concept of getting mine
You shook as an old fact, Pharaohs is born to shine
And body a motherfucker, won’t do a bit of time
My arrogance on the mic like none other grind
Older than adolescent boys and past ?
A slang editor level box, this beat bang
If ? is touching goons stick you for loose change
Yeah that’s your last six bucks, bitch boy duck
Run for cover, rounds spinning graze your wife and mother
Syze, Demoz, Vinnie Paz, and Des D
Bringing this animal rap so niggas bless me

[Verse 2: Demoz]
D is for the way I demolish niggas
E is for the way I exit the room without being spotted, nigga (can’t spot me, nigga)
M is for the multiple bullets inside the gun
O is for the obstacle you thought I couldn’t overcome
Z is for the way I’m zoned out (zoned out)
I’m pulling the chrome out, I shoot a nigga’s flesh till his bones out
I don’t give a fuck about police (I don’t give a fuck)
Nigga you know me, I shoot under pressure like Kobe
Then hop in the whip and just take off
If you ain’t in my circle then I’m killing everybody like Adolf (everybody)
Chainsaw massacre, I’m ripping his face off
Fuck a bar of soap, I stuff a sock with an eight-ball

[Hook: Demoz]
If you a nigga with an issue and got access to a pistol
Listen closely put your clip in the gun (put your clip in the gun)
If a nigga hating on you cause you nice and he the opposite
Listen closely take a sip of this rum, shoot his bitch and his son

Now if a cop is following you and you know you riding a dirty
Grab your pistol and get ready for war, nigga we ready for war
So if they catch you and sitting for an army in a cell
Kill yourself, give em a story to tell, give em a story to tell

[Verse 3: King Syze]
Eh yo this ain’t no breaking news, the Pharaohs we been murking it
Hurting shit permanent, populate some turbulence
We beat you incoherent like people popping them Percocets
New game we birthed it, honestly we earning this
And we get up in the lab and make music for us
We chasing the main phrase you know in God we trust
And the skills never change, staying strong and forever reign
Haters love to talk but believe man they never gain
Mic ministry spitting misery every single day
For that little bit of pay we spit metal your way
We get hectic for a monstrous amount of scrilla
Money is the root of all evil man, it makes me a killer

[Verse 4: Vinnie Paz]
It’s on now, I’m coming at you with machetes and hatchets
Everything I do is brutal, incredibly graphic
Of mice and men motherfuckers you tend to the rabbits
Suicidal, I wish the Unabomber sent me a package
I don’t know if you faggot but y’all is very puss
I just know I’m running through motherfuckers like Reggie Bush
I don’t think I’m lazy, I just need a steady push
Then I’m ready with the Beretti for any petty crook
I’m ready for anybody to come out and assault
I run with brothers that’s gully and they fouler than pork
You a pussy, you running from the sound of the Hawk
I turn a rock into rubble, you get ground into chalk

[Hook: Demoz]
If you a nigga with an issue and got access to a pistol
Listen closely put your clip in the gun (put your clip in the gun)
If a nigga hating on you cause you nice and he the opposite
Listen closely take a sip of this rum, shoot his bitch and his son
Now if a cop is following you and you know you riding a dirty
Grab your pistol and get ready for war, nigga we ready for war
So if they catch you and sitting for an army in a cell
Kill yourself, give em a story to tell, give em a story to tell
