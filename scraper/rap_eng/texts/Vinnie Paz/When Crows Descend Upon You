[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
I'm just evil biologically, listen to y'all that make a mockery
Anton LaVey is like a god to me
I am not possibly associated with your democracy
Gary Heidnik is like a shah to me, go to war logically
I conduct self Nostradamusly, I am Ibrahim's last prophecy
Earth is my property, I am possessed like I'm an apostrophe
Vinny Appice is like a star to me
Paz swears silently, cut your fucking head like a lobotomy
Rape the fucking beat like sodomy
Nietzschean philosophy, I am a vampire, I'm proud to be
I cannot be seen in your photography
Vinnie an anomaly, I am not a part of God's colony
Three inches of blood on my carpeting making things hard for me
My own family won't talk to me, I have to pray to Allah constantly honestly

[Hook: Demoz]
I'm having nervous dreams, nigga this a murder scene
Yellow tape around the booth, no one heard em scream
He don't deserve to dream, nigga this a murder scene
Yellow tape around the booth, I'm having nervous dreams

I let my pistol bang, the Official Pistol Gang
So what's the issue man? I can make a tissue hang
I'm having nervous dreams, nigga this a murder scene
Yellow tape wrapped around the booth, nobody heard em scream

[Verse 2: Demoz]
Underground like dirt and the oil
Earth and the soil, I burn like boil
Destroy rappers, King Kong massacre
Bullets ricochet playing ping pong passengers
Won't make it, the real won't fake it
If something don't belong to you then don't take it
A naked eye can look loyal but don't trust em
That's why I chill with women, fuck em but don't cuff em
Cheat and won't treat em, beat em and won't eat em
Leave em and won't feed em
Believe me a cold demon, I am but I won't leave em
Until that we both even
Until she catch me fucking a 20 year old Rican
On top of the fucking bed we make love and both sleeping
Now that's the hundredth time she caught me with hoes cheating
I think I got a problem with being faithful
It's not that I ain't grateful, it's just something about me so hateful

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
I'm strutting with the black mask, can't pass on the cash
Relax on the grass, can't slack on the slash
There's no rest, there's no 2 and a half hour crash
I'm all about the cash, outwit and outlast
In mass covered in black from gun powder blast
Can care less if you wear a flag or a badge
I'm trying to have mattresses of cash
I'm trying to have the bachelor pad built up with packages and bags
No matter how many bodies amass in the trash
I stay on the move, bad news travels fast
I stay with the smoking weapon and no discretion
It's a gross obsession, I keep it close under low detection
Don't provoke me and don't ask any loaded questions
I don't go for one soul, I want the whole collection
Send you on that long road to perfection
Murder all the men who swore an oath of protection
