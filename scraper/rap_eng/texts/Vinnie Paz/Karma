[Intro]
What goes around comes around
What goes around comes around
What goes around comes around

[Verse 1: Jon Quest]
K.A.R.MA, comes around if you do dirt for the pennies
In my lifetime fair share I had plenty
Credit card scams times I brought the mans with me
I had to dash quickly
Switch places with my Mom's whip
A get-away driver I'm the gyp
That's my story bet I'm sticking to it
Bumping ??? music, these devil's I'm hearing got a boy influenced
I'm riding, see Jesus in the passenger
Vinnie, Hubbs, and Jon, guaranteed a massacre
Don't let my age fool you I got jewels like Africa
Time to come clean for my sins like they damage ya
Life's so real against those chills
Shit I can't escape from my bars ???
Mama said I'll have days like this, but Karma's a bitch
26, broke, raising kids like this

[Verse 2: Hubbs]
It come's around full circle
When you planting foul seeds but the ground too fertile
Trying to stay on track yea I found a few hurdles
But my shortcuts turn into my worst wounds
Thinking back to my foul ways
Grown man stuck in my child days
A fast buck turns into bad luck
Bagging up, getting bagged up, mad as fuck
In the back of a paddy truck, god damn I've had enough
Young and wild acting like I never had enough
But in reality had more than the average does
Took for granted what was granted to us
Hands are cuffed like damn look what it's landed us
Doing dumb shit, to pressing down thumb prints
Got a bright future so I'm begging for a sponge mix
Man it never had to be this way
But either way still see him in my dreams today


[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
Still paying for shit I did back in '94
A disrespectful asshole, just a wild bull
My momma told me that's not what I was designed for
Headphone's playing Black Flag My War
You don't wanna be locked up behind bars
Don't want to see the big monsters in the lime walls
You don't understand the purpose of divine law
Rick Ross can rhyme, but he ain't a crime lord
Why you think they shot his mafuckin' ride for?
Cause you can tell he ain't gangster from his eyeballs
I wrote graffiti first time I saw Star Wars
Me and my father watching Three days of the Condour
I'm just trying to enter the greatness of God's door
I'm just trying to see through the fakeness of cyborgs
Being stupid ain't something I'm trying to die for
My son Marciano who I got to ride for
