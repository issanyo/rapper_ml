[Chief Kamachi]
Yeah yeah
Uh yo yo, yo yo yo, Jedi Mind yo yo
Yo, my words sojourn, spread em like a slow germ, infected
Disease is collected and quarantined from my method
The borderline where the animal and divine become separate
I'm Def Leppard, case of beautiful hell on a record
Compel the skeptic when Kamachi unveil the epic
It's needed and requested
Brought to you like Elijah in the message
A jury of ancestors was sequestered
To decide my fate, for conductors of viscous vespers
Candlelight death is extras
Is usually hollow point flesh presses
Until they skin caress stretchers
I'm the best to finesse textures
My rhyme fabric, is elaborate, scrolls kept in a gold cabinet
Open the book to the chapter of this old soul magic
Juju tongue to voodoo come, behold this untold havoc
Up north grab it, then I hit the south pole with a magnet
East and west avid, now my name on all four points of the square
It's firmly established, the language is lavish
First to rock Roshashannah's and African pajamas
Swear before I die to be there with the best of the rhymers
Music for different ears, hears in different spheres
Global ink like the mobile link, make sure the pitch is clear
K-A-M-A-C-H-I be the dopest in here

*Vocal sample*
"Too much...I'm tired"
"In the company of those that fear..."
"In the company of ...fear"

[Ikon]
Yo we smash mics, but y'all wanna build
But in the face of death, you can't kill
And that's real, we fear what we feel
But y'all mo'fuckers can't overstand skill
If y'all stalk me, we Buck like Milwaukee
But y'all, y'all just do a lot of talkin
And maybe that's why you fear what the devil does
Maybe that's the appeal of a metal slug
You ain't a ghetto thug, you an actress
That's unnatural, like love between faggots!

"In the company of ...fear"

[Jus Allah]
I burn leaf with Ikon and the Chief nigga
This next bud is not for you
Watching you made me land a clenched hand to your nostril
Stopping you from giving the god cold stares
Beware, my flares put poets in rolling chairs
None are prepared when the holocaust begins
You'll have the roach smoked down to the sole of your Timbs
Now I'm, holding your gems, you're holding for dear life
Any motherfucker holding the heat can have ice
You're just like a bitch with no top on
At the Houston five, you lay down to get shot on
Double check, you're dead, plugged twice in your mug
I'm high off the weed, drunk off the cop's blood

"Too much...I'm tired"
"In the company of those that fear"
"In the company of....fear"

"Above all, there was fear
Fear of today, fear of tomorrow
Fear of our neighbors, and fear of ourself"

"We came from distant space and even what some might call
Another dimension...and we're about to return"
