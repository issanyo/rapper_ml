Yeah, Pazienza baby. Billions what up cuzzo? Yeah cuzzo
DJ Tricka??. Philly in the building out here. We mobbing on you mothafuckas
Kna mean? Official Pistol Gang and all that. It's how we get down out here

[Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz:]
I don't mean to brag but the knife work nice
And the rhyme's so evil that it might hurt Christ, yeah
Don't fuck around if you like your life
And the pistol always on me like it's white on rice
Once I hit the block cousin, it's all rad
Spray them with the four-five Glock and they all dead
Devil tried sleepin' in God bed
Amaryte 666 on the forehead
I make dough, but I don't fuck with the books
As a young boy maybe I would fuck with the chooks
That's how it had to be fuckin' with crooks
I'm a king in a castle so you fuckin' with rooks
Anyone want beef just ask for it
He can catch a universe ?? and get trashed for it
I keep a couple ratchets in the jazzport
And they will put your fuckin' brains on the dashboard
