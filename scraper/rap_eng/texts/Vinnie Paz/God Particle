[Intro: Sample]
Back to the hardcore!

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Intelligent infinity, malevolent epitome
They consider me as the most deadly weapon from Italy
That'll include the Benelli semi-auto artillery
Literally cryogenically treated to be invisibly
Symphony slicker than sixty Sicilianos from Sicily
Motherfuckers talking but never gonna do shit to me
I'm about to set it on motherfuckers officially
Rip they spine out and just put them out of they misery
No more mister nice guy, everything maliciously
Who can stop me now you with Luca Brasi where fishes be
It's impossible that you're righteous without the dignity
If it's a problem you motherfuckers can come and visit me

[Verse 2: Planetary]
Super humanity gradually back from my galaxy
Burning them calories, I'm still yearning to earn a salary
The son of anarchy, I'm in court pleading insanity
Can it be all the panicking and agony that's trapping me?
Tragically introducing you rappers to tragedy
Happily ever after if after means you a casualty
Praise those who savagely sacrifice their reality
Bury bones and annually dig them up unhappily
Catch me flossing dead in the center of gravity
Bonafide, a mix between Maxi Priest and the Maccabees
My mentality manipulating your mastery
The master, disaster strikes whatever's in back of me

[Verse 3: Esoteric]
Playtime is over, daytime is over
The finest soldiers, take nines from holsters
My only weapons: K-9s and Cobras
We diamond poachers, we take your shine, we some mind controllers
My rhyme is solar-flaring, airing out the kind below us
You know Lois Lane - know my name
I'm throwing flames at your brain like Ghost Rider
My flow's tighter, I'm Blakey Griffin with an open lane
My foe is Bane, my flow is Betsy Ross off the Zoloft: so insane
I'm over-trained in hand-to-hand and man-to-man my hammers land and can ya fam
I'm a brutal rapper, you're a Chutes & Ladders
Candyland emcee, I'm completely AOTP 'til the death
Esoteric zombie-killer taking out whatever's left

[Hook: Planetary]
You're mad 'cause the army's here
Top to bottom army gear
Gunshots is all you hear
Death come to all who's near
We're running through the village killing, building a regime
Heavy unstoppable
Crown of thorns form, we ready

[Sample]
When playtime's over I'll take your mind back to the hardcore

[Verse 4: Apathy]
The God particle, Armageddon weapons in my arsenal
I'm the real deal, fuck an Alex Jones article
Heart is arctic cold, my murders are nautical
Murk you in the murky depths where the screams aren't audible
Salutations, standing over the body salivating
Was kicked out of hell 'cause I wouldn't bow to Satan
I'm the boss, I turn your albums off
I turn your brain to apple sauce, my wingspan is like an Albatross
Out the frost, mouth spewing out exhaust out come the claws
Power force that can blow the tops of mountains off
Blow the head of cowards off, you'll get carried off
Y'all as soft as fairies buried in terrycloth

[Verse 5: Celph Titled]
In '94 I dreamt of spreading Salt-n-Pepa's legs
But I was busy playing dodgeball with severed heads
Conducting chaos with a chrome baton
So sound the smoke alarm
'Cause overall I broke your arms
And kicked your ass with loafers on
Homeboy this HK settle wars
I'm a dragon, you're a faggot with a tape measure sword
Celph Titled is a motherfucking problem
With germs that are infectious
Attack like German Shepherds while acid dissolve 'em
I got the ratchet - I blast it
You got a ratchet, but you keep it in your jacket
Undercover brother on your album cover trying to look like you crazy
When your theme song should be Aerosmith, "Dude (Looks Like a Lady)"

[Hook: Planetary]
You're mad 'cause the army's here
Top to bottom army gear
Gunshots is all you hear
Death come to all who's near
We're running through the village killing, building a regime
Heavy unstoppable
Crown of thorns form, we ready

When playtime's over I'll take your mind back to the hardcore
