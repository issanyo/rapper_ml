[Verse 1: Jus Allah]
I have the killing gene, I have machine guns and guillotines
I’m the guerrilla of Philistines, I’m living the killer’s dream
I just let the victim kick and scream
Get the blood and smithereens out with Mr. Clean
Separate your figurine into different dumpsters
I’m getting hungrier and I ain’t getting any younger
Niggas should’ve killed me, now the wait’s longer
And the incapability made me stronger
I’mma die in service, I serve a higher purpose
I ain’t nervous of what surfaces from wire searches
Mom sits inside a church reciting Bible verses
I’m entitled to idle my homicidal urges
I don’t prefer help, getting to the death quotients
It works by itself set in perpetual motion
But I remove it, there’s some probability to use it
Cause I might lose it, present company included

[Hook]

The street light is the only light that ever shine
Kill devils with metal from the Beretta nine
If I shine (I shine) heavy metal grind
Must be out your fucking mind, never question mine

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
You should never upset the man, the bullets the size of Pepsi cans
I am godly while y’all are doing the best you can
Me and Jus Allah lions and the rest are lambs
I am possibly atrocity in West Sudan
I’m humanism, I’m through the prism of western man
I’m pugilism, I’m voodooism, I bless the sand
My hands are made of titanium, I could wreck a van
Lazarus, I am from Damascus and I am Sham
I ain’t letting go until the fucking clip is done
Y’all offbeat, every word I speak hit the drum
The most beautiful thing to me is a glistening gun
I find y’all is entertainment while I’m sipping rum
And if I ever fall on hard luck
I’ll put some white on the street like a salt truck
Cause I ain’t trying to be hungry again
With these lowlife motherfucking dummies again, (never again god)

[Hook]
