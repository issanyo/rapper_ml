[Intro: Sample]
*gunshot*
It's comin', it's comin'
You wear a gun, the beast 'til the end that is
This is the twilight winter
I am ready to be her son
It's now, I will rise to her side!
I don't need the words, I'm beyond

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Keep it homie, this is a gangsta party
Bullet proof glass Ferrari
Die sorry, by the hand of vampires and zombies
Fire bombing, suicide army, God's inside me
Ride till I motherfucking die high in Canarsie
Unfocusable, exploding smoking toast to you vultures
Soldiers in hemoglobin, words of evil spoken invoking
Volcanoes evoked, these veterans are very violent
Non Phixion, Jedi Mind Tricks a deadly virus
I could just go live no love, I read Kaballah on drugs
Gun in my wig, getting my dick sucked
Bitches spitting cum on each others clits for kicks
Cocaine tits, degenerates smothered in shit
Another day in paradise surrounded by bloodsuckers and parasites
Getting in shoot outs for Amorites
Leave ya block flooded with blood, it's horrifying I promise
Eat shit, suck, fuck, kill and die honest

[Chorus]
The big bad fearless wolf
I'm the end of the world
Wearing the flesh of fallen angels
I've scanned the reality
I see it, the corruption of flesh
And blood to you all!

[Verse 2: Sabac]
Call me the rap Che Guevara, lounging in the black grave's terror
I lace tracks with terror forever smelling death
Reoccurring nightmares of burning flesh
Must be the spirit of Koresh that keep me turning in the bed
Troopers hovering, you'll be suffering, crews be bugging
When they rather shoot they brother than abuse the government
Our crews make covenants from writing darkness
When we spark this, the hardest part is when Gods is
Dealing with fake artists, I face charges for speaking my piece
Unleash the beast after nine eleven still got beef with police
Street's a warzone we more prone to violence and greed
No voice leaves no choice they trying to silence the seeds
Time is when will you get yours, stop relying on me
I'm firing with speed so before you dying you'll bleed
This is a war call, I warn y'all, stay up, build your health
Or get fucked up, cut up ya wrist and kill yourself

[Chorus]
The flesh of fallen angels come to me all!
A secret, living on by the skin of reality
I am the wolf!, 'til the end
I don't need the words, I'm the beyond the words

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
The street is Vietnam, I'm like Jesus trying to complete a psalm
I believe in Islam, heathens can bleed till they gone
It's on, anyone can get hit
Anyone can get the center of their energy split
My enemies fit to face Palestine
Y'all bitch rappers only got heart on Valentine's
And all of y'all that wanna know how my metal feel
It gets settled in the temple when my Beretta kill
My pen bleeds the ink y'all spill
But y'all still seem to think y'all real
Jedi Mind real put the nine to ya grill
We spit real and y'all run for the hills
I stab you in the back till it weakens the knees
Then smash you with a statue of Jesus that bleeds

[Chorus]
I've tasted the devil's green blood
It runs in my veins
I've seen beyond the world
The architecture of blood and bone marrow
Death is coming!
I have tasted the flesh of fallen angels
I am the wolf yes!, I am the wolf!
