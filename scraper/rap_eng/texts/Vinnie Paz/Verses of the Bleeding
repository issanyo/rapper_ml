[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Allahu Akbar, everybody just be calm
That's the word passed down from the imam
It came from the Qur'an, it can't be wrong
It's only measured in time of God's eons
So I suggest you follow Allah way
Or turn into a bitch inside the jungle's the raw way
That's what the law say, you ain't ready for that
You better bring a bulletproof and machete for that
And nobody want to be there
They stick you with dirty motherfuckers up in the tear
Now it's back to the topic at hand, I'm rocking your fam
And fight against the army with a rock in my hand
A Glock in my hand, divide your body into two parts
Exchange entire theories of God by spitting two darts
But I just want people to build
And did imam Al Husayn know that he would be killed?

[Hook x2: Vinnie Paz, Des Devious]
We coming for blood, in the name of Allah
We coming for blood, and we ain't playing with y'all
We coming for blood, we destroy and rebuild
We coming for blood, if you ain't loyal, you killed

[Verse 2: Des Devious]
I got a vice grip on the mic spitting my shit
My balls and arrogance alone be the cause of these hits
Easily split your wig with the flick of a wrist
Send a block, your body dragging you into the abyss
But that's some sick shit I only do when I trip
Or when I'm tailing motherfuckers running they lip
That's when I start the procedure of body beating you to a seizure
Your crew is standing there staring looking like non-believers
I felt 'em standing and staring, that's when I pulled the heater
My ratchet cooking these faggots, I make 'em all see the
Fact of the matter is, if you don't back down
This ain't no slap down, you getting clapped clown
So don't be running 'round, talking all this and that
That's female shit, type of shit that get you trapped
Into a dark corner, rope pulling on ya
Tried to escape, head shots left your ass a goner

[Hook x2: Vinnie Paz, Des Devious]
We coming for blood, in the name of Allah
We coming for blood, and we ain't playing with y'all
We coming for blood, we destroy and rebuild
We coming for blood, if you ain't loyal, you killed

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
I'm ready to blackout, crippler cross-face tap-out
Coming through the fucking door with the gats out
Let the blood rain down and drip on your skin
Let the slug hit your crown and rip from your limbs
I'm the illest fucking rapper alive
Give me sixteen shots, I can crack you in five
I have to survive, have to get my money and shine
Have to get everything that I used to promise my mom
I got to do it for everyone that I promised something
For everyone who thought I wouldn't be alive or something
Come on money, that's some cold shit, wishing me dead
So I'm beating they mid-section till they pissing in red
