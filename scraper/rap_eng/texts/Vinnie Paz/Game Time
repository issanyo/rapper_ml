[Interlude 1: Sean Price
Team Homi.  Let’s go.  Yo

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Game time, I'm the famous and fancy
No shucking and jiving, no Amos 'n' Andy
Fucking with the Ruckus, this alias is handy
Clap guns, you wack, son, Jackson and Randy.  Uh
Can he rap?  Of course, but can he strap
The balls?  Slam cats on floors.  You Manny Pac
Heavyweight champ of rap
Never late, Dezzie shake, gravitate your hat.  Uh
P bodied the fiend.  The Team Homi
Your team’s sloppy.  To beam properly, leave all you knocked
P the dude with disciples, I'm Jesus Price.  I told my
A-Alike, “Chill, B.  We don't C/see alike.”  Don't hit
Girls, but, best believe, I will beat a dyke to fuck down
‘Til the bitch turn into Tina Ike—I’ll beat it right
A friend of Sevah's is a friend of mine, Dia-
-bolic.  I’ll beef, I’ll defend it with Timbs and my nine, yes

[Verse 2: Diabolic]
Yo, I used to be broke.  Now my stacks are popping. Got chicks
Fatter than Action Bronson cooking crack in Compton
The fact is I've been hanging out like muffin tops
Building something that could bring The Juggernaut to a sudden stop
On the roughest blocks, set foot and your blood'll clot
Stopping heart functions and it starts pumping butterscotch
Me and Vinnie'll squeeze the semi with Ruck and Rock
And have these law-abiding citizens screaming, "Fuck the cops!"
Plot until the cuffs are locked, knocking 'Bolic's plans
And Rick Ross is there, checking my cell for contraband (Rugh)
Lying thief trying to reach the promised land
Drunk enough to do shots with 2Pac's hologram
Body-slam somebody, unload some sort of gat
And leave their pockets empty quicker than mobile quarterbacks (Gimme that!)
Sean'll snap if you pop shit you won't endorse
Your broken jawbones’ll sever both your vocal cords

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
What you have here is a death cult
Take this motherfucker's sweet Vick, god, and let's bolt
I ain’t fucking ‘round, receiving rabbit ears and get yoked
If I ain’t had a voice, it’s ‘cause I had a fear of strep throat
You see, it feel lonely at the top
Even if you have a Tenderoni and some rock
I’ll cook drugs, mama, macaroni in the pot
In the Nineties, I should have been signed to Sony with the watts (I should have been signed)
(To Tommy Mottol) I ain’t think I’d live to see thirty-five
I had the hammer and the forty watching Jersey Drive
Who’s this Sicilian white bol?  God, I heard he live
He as filthy as cucaracha in the dirty Stuy
You see, I keep the bulldog in the car seat
I’ll respond to y'all criticism by eating dog meat
I don't see you as competition ‘cause y'all sweet
I’ll dump the body in the back like it's a car seat
Stupid!
