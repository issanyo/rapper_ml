[Intro: Riley Martin, author of 'The Coming of Tan', speech sample]
"Perhaps you will believe the million feet of film that's been taken above... uh... Mexico City, and various other places. If you think that you are alone in this universe or that you are the guardians of this universe, then you are rudely mistaken."

[Verse 1: El Eloh from Lost Children of Babylon]
Took a physical odyssey to the fathers of Shabazz
With the shamans of the Cherokees
Arrived in Nevada, ten miles away from NASA
Met the farmer in which he revealed to me the
Ohioan crop circles that linked all the star constellations
To the nineteenth galaxy
The metaphysicist that quote the Roswell
New Mexican deserts of Death Valley
With E.B.E. – extraterrestrial biological entity
Discovering extraordinary memories
Glided across Glassland
Suddenly seeing illuminations from the seven heavens circle of sand
Of Area 51 and 57, separate the schoolkid and reveal the reptilian
I seen the CIA transform into the species of Greys
The Sabbath seven adding up to seven levels of the Majestic 12
Neoclassic traveller
I travel the Twilight Zone with Einstein and Nikola Tesla
Walk through the wilderness of Ibilis
As the flying disc of Ezekiel
The pope stands upon the podium
Becomes a Zeta Reticulian
Behold the arrival of the Nephilim

[Verse 2: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
Beware the prophecies of the Tarots
Alien spacecraft flying away like Sparrows
Study the lost prophetic books of the bible
That recites fallen body energies: spiritual survival
Flying discs seen in Ezekiel 1:3
Granted Kingu a tablet of destinies
Semjase spoke the word of the Bavarian Illuminati
I bring forth harmonics of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Annunaki planted the seed where I dwell
Either vortex turbines pulling me to hell
Awareness upon my savannah is omni dimensional
Grey species has a common memory complex of the social
Liquid crystal colloidal membranes responding
To the spectrum of the universal intelligence matrix
The basis is that extraterrestrials created Christ
And have a device that recorded all of Earth's history
And can display it in the form of a hologram precise
Construction of synthetic humanoids is among us
You have entered the Land of Nod
To face the deafening thunders and the spiritual wonders
Because the harvest now is coming
Beware the worldwide ancient tunnel system
The government is running
Hectic! Verbal slaughterer of the Judeo-Christian ethic

[Interlude]
Hare Rāma Hare Rāma
Rāma Rāma Hare Hare
Hare Rāma Hare Rāma
Rāma Rāma Hare Hare

[Hook: El Eloh]
And the world has turned on the last spin
The coming of Tan to this wicked land
And the world has turned on the last spin
The coming of Tan to this wicked land

[Verse 3: El Eloh]
Fled with the five, led through a European wooded ravine
And seen Stonehenge connect and bring upon the Annunaki
The highest Kabbalah's mystic chants "b'nai Elohim"
And looks to the sky for prophecy was abducted in Nebraska
Then taken back to the laboratory
Experiment performed before me
Nonearthly alien autopsy
Psycho social biological and electro-
Magnetic manipulation of human consciousness
The Vulcan walks about the abyss

[Verse 3: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
The Verbal Hologram: royal killer like Shorgize
Speak Babylonian and Hebrew, Genesis like the star gods
Blessed by Biaviians like the French theologians
Antichrist is coming in the form of a powerful Roman
Development of AIDS was funded in 1969 for the seven
Injected into the hundred million Africans in '77
Cuneiform inscriptions in Western Asia of the Nabu
Dwell in hell, celestial bodies: twelve like Kathabu
But I can rob you of your spirit soul like Xenu
Elders imprisoned, negative paraphysical beings we knew
Function outside the time track like Essassani
I chose to be enclosed and I fold too like Origami
Comprehend the theory of reflection like Paromatma
In the epic Sanskrit history of the world like Mahabharata
Praise to His Divine Grace AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada

[Hook: El Eloh]
And the world has turned on the last spin
The coming of Tan to this wicked land
And the world has turned on the last spin
The coming of Tan to this wicked land

If you stood up above the stratosphere and downloaded seven gigawatts of negative ions into the turbines, would this not disrupt the electromagnetic flow?
