[Intro]
[Sample]
Boxcutter Pazzie
Y'all motherfuckers beat me in a dream
You better wake up and apologize
Aight, look

[Verse 1]
You can't out-maneuver me I'm in the peak position
I'm the creator of everything you perceive as wisdom
I build with O.G. God-body peep the vision
Ramirez over Whitaker that's just a weak decision
The God's nice with his hands, but don't think, though
AK-47, Andrei Kirilenko
They thought Vinnie was 'Rican and not gringo
Needed hardbody production and called Bingo
I'm a guinea, I fuck around with casino bastards
A cataclysm, metabolism, amino-acids
Y'all motherfuckers sleeping like Christina Onassis
How you prove my father's dead, I never seen his ashes
I will kill motherfuckers, that is plainly said
And that's the thirteenth chapter to engage the dead
The most confidential part of what the Veda said
This a Vietnam song, Vinnie takes his head

[Hook]
Oh y'all want a fatal disease? (God bless)
Oh y'all trying to prey on me? (God bless)
Ain't nobody fucking with V (God bless)
The seventh day best for me (So God rest)
Oh y'all want a fatal disease? (God bless)
Oh y'all trying to prey on me? (God bless)
Ain't nobody fucking with V (God bless)
The seventh day best for me (So God rest)

[Verse 2]
Everywhere that you see joy, I see the pain
It's just the infiltration of poison in my vein
Maybe it's a bit of paranoia in my brain
Or how I see the hasidim and goyim is the same
Maybe it's why I see Kaczynski as if he was sane
He was possibly the product of a Christian name (Y'all are pagans)
Leo Zagami told us about the shifting change
But y'all ain't listenin' to him, y'all just want to shift the blame
Or maybe y'all just think I'm twisted and I'm on one
Or that of the infernal power of the horned one (Lucifer's free)
You don't wanna shoot the fire so come on dun
You don't have the clarity to feel the power of God's drum
Do you overstand the God and his wealth?
Have you ever seen a person just demolish himself?
All you rat motherfuckers only lie to yourselves
I'mma end it for you pussy, say goodbye to yourself, stupid

[Hook]
Oh y'all want a fatal disease? (God bless)
Oh y'all trying to prey on me? (God bless)
Ain't nobody fucking with V (God bless)
The seventh day best for me (So God rest)
Oh y'all want a fatal disease? (God bless)
Oh y'all trying to prey on me? (God bless)
Ain't nobody fucking with V (God bless)
The seventh day best for me (So God rest)

God Bless
So God rest
