[Hook: Carolyn D'Elia]
Someday a change is gonna come (get ready)
Someday a change is gonna come (hit this city)
Someday a change is gonna come

[Verse 1: Saigon]
Okay, now for my last election
I'm under pressure like Manning without the pass protection
Television is just a weapon of mass deception
Why you think all these women are getting ass-injections?
I don't know who's greedier, government or the media
Don't believe everything you read on that Wikipedia
Most of these websites are opposite dead right
Meaning they mostly dead wrong so you gotta be head-strong
Don't allow yourself to be lead on
In other words manipulated, love is hardly ever reciprocated
Otherwise, we rise above the lies
Strive to describe wise ways to praise all of the others that died
Even though my stance is political
I be hard so you can still dance just a little
There once was a monkey, now there's a man in the middle
And you know Shuko with them damn instrumentals
We couldn't've put it down, homie look around
It's the underground, none of that bullshit to be found
If you lovin' the sound, it's bound to come back around
Now put your fist in the air, say yeah, right motherfucking now

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Politicians just sittin' in a war-room
If it was up to me, they'd be in a court room
Corporate welfare, who the fuck it's going to?
Take a 30 of money and then they taunt you
Is it the clowning literacy that harms you?
The information out here, what you gon' do?
Barack don't care, he just send in more troops
Arm-chair politics on a bar stool
While the rich man eating on the poor's food
They apathetic to what the hood is going through
You think babies in the projects harmful?
You think that they don't pray underneath the scars too?
You kill thousands of people under Saddam rule
But then it's terrorism when they try to bomb you?
You ain't taking my guns, I got an armful
Kill these motherfuckers, turn 'em into dog food

[Hook]

[Verse 3: R.A. the Rugged Man]
Criminal acts in the dark doubling, the hearts suffering
The odds I'm duckin' 'em, all this hatred towards God is troubling
Savages living sacrilegious, a bunch of babbling bitches
Satan disguised as media attacking the scriptures, attracting the lizards
Demons accusing the righteous of being the bigots
And brainwashed children in society believing the critics
Killing, living in a sin, and sittin' in a cell in prison
Lacking of independent thinking is sickening
Stop following the public opinion
They tricking you to support the corrupt system
Keeping your thoughts limited, inhibited with no knowledge or wisdom
I'm breaking the demon, the fake heathen, it's Hate Season
Any snake deceiving, I'll make sure they no longer ain't breathing
Was I born a savage and having to sin
Can they mentally and morally civilize a savage and make him a king?
Making the misfortunate forfeit, poisoning the piss-poor kids
Bio-hazardous chemicals out the sink faucets
When the moon turn red, that's the end and everybody dies
Meteor-showers and lambs with 7 horns and 7 eyes
Putting and end to earth's evils, six-wing creatures
Four different kinds with faces of lions, ox's and eagles
Come on

[Hook]
