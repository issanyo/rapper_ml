[Hook]
I’m takin' my own life, I might as well
And that's where I’m goin'
Because the Devil’s inside of me
I’m takin' my own life, that’s where I’m goin'
Except they might not sell weed in Hell
I’m takin' my own life, I might as well
And that's where I’m goin'
Because the Devil’s inside of me
I’m takin' my own life, that’s where I’m goin'
Except they might not sell weed in Hell

[Verse 1]
See, I always have respect, 'cause I always talk fact
The .38 and the .50 caliber, hawk black
I always left with nothin' but I always brought back
I always been a hustler, I probably go off that
Y’all don’t wanna go to work with the boy
There’s only two words that describe me: search and destroy
I don’t think you wanna get murked by the boy
My shit is military, y’all's is like a nursery toy
It’s hurtin' you boys
My team ain’t even hungry, we famished
I murder everybody, fuck collateral damage
I’m animal savage with Hannibal’s habits
I’ll mangle your cabbage
I walked into the parish and I strangled the faggots
I hang with the baddest brothers, put their trust into Jesus
Run with brothers who’s 40 guzzlers, Islamic extremists
Ugly and ignorant is how they perceive us
I don’t care, I’m tryin' to deal with my personal demons

[Hook]
I’m takin' my own life, I might as well
And that's where I’m goin'
Because the Devil’s inside of me
I’m takin' my own life, that’s where I’m goin'
Except they might not sell weed in Hell
I’m takin' my own life, I might as well
And that's where I’m goin'
Because the Devil’s inside of me
I’m takin' my own life, that’s where I’m goin'

[Verse 2]
Y’all don’t wanna go that route
Broke motherfucker need to throw his throwback out
If you see me drinkin' somethin' good, I stole that stout
If you see me drinkin' in the hood, then roll back out
On the real, I don’t want no one to bother me, cousin
Rappin' is just a little fuckin' bit of part of me, cousin
I’m just tryin' to have a drink at the bar with my cousin
I ain’t mean to be rude, God, pardon me, cousin
I stay strapped, Lord, gun in the tuck
Young boys act wild, Lord, funny as fuck
I scrap southpaw, Sonny'in' you fucks
Look at you, Lord, on the floor, bummy as fuck
What? My life been defined by death
So I guess if everybody dead, mine is next
My father dropped a jewel on me, time forgets
It’s not as easily the mind forgets, y’all know what I mean?

[Hook]
I’m takin' my own life, I might as well
And that's where I’m goin'
Because the Devil’s inside of me
I’m takin' my own life, that’s where I’m goin'
Except they might not sell weed in Hell
I’m takin' my own life, I might as well
And that's where I’m goin'
Because the Devil’s inside of me
I’m takin' my own life, that’s where I’m goin'
Except they might not sell weed in Hell

[Verse 3]
Drag you to Hell, I’m evil dead, you can call me Sam Raimi
These motherfuckers want a verse but they can’t pay me
Fuck a funeral home, put 'em in the sand maybe
Y’all are actin' like you’re big, like you’re mad gravy
Y’all don’t wanna beef with the god
Don’t have the brain power to compete with the god
Y’all should retreat from the god
Before you get turned to meat
Somethin' to eat for the god, peace to the gods
I carry heavy shit, big guns, John Rambo
I’m a spot rusher like Pakistani commandos
How you go to war when you’re standin' in sandals?
Now you’re dead and your family handlin' candles
Don’t even call for a truce
I’m about to end this whole motherfucker
When I call for the troops
Reservoir dog walk with the troops, and I burn this motherfucker down to the ground down to its roots

[Hook]
I’m takin' my own life, I might as well
And that's where I’m goin'
Because the Devil’s inside of me
I’m takin' my own life, that’s where I’m goin'
Except they might not sell weed in Hell
I’m takin' my own life, I might as well
And that's where I’m goin'
Because the Devil’s inside of me
I’m takin' my own life, I might as well
That’s where I’m goin'
That’s where I’m goin'
That’s where I’m goin'
That’s where I’m goin'
That’s where I’m goin'
Because the Devil’s inside of me
That’s where I’m goin'
That’s where I’m goin'
That’s where I’m goin'
That’s where I’m goin'
Because the Devil’s inside of me
