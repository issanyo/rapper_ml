[Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, one two, Pack Pistol Pazzy
Heavy Metal Kings, Billy Idol, listen

[Verse 1: Vinnie paz]
Trust me money, you don't wanna get into a tussle
He murdered over nothing and I did it on a muscle
We need to be discussing how to hit another hustle
The gun's too big to ever fit into the duffle
This ain't nothing new ock, this is how we do things
And I'll be swinging Epps like I was listening to 2 Chainz
A great white shark on top of the fucking food chain
The accu-bomb range, bullets longer than a shoestring
You talking to a maniac who started on a bottom tier
Cut so many people you would think I had a barber chair
Rob a rich motherfucker quicker than Obama Care
[?]  front of yard in a driver chair
Asked me for a burro so I gave him a taste
And a blickie had it pussy getting sprayed in his face
The AK have his body leaning like an endo
He see a full eclipse cause I gave him the extendo

[Chorus: Vinnie Paz]
One gun
Line 'em up!
Two gun
Line 'em up!
AR-15, infrared red beam
Line 'em up!
One gun
Line 'em up!
Two gun
Line 'em up!
Infrared red beam, AR-15
Line 'em up!

One gun
Line 'em up!
Two gun
Line 'em up!
AR-15, infrared red beam
Line 'em up!
One gun
Line 'em up!
Two gun
Line 'em up!
Infrared red beam, AR-15
Line 'em up!

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Yo, the assault of the goons, walkin' to my author of doom
An awesome assortment of mooks and all because of the shrooms
My mindframe, distorted and odd
Like Omar Suarez in the car bent, offering jobs
Extorted the mob, got the whole planet's cornered and robbed
Got a pistol in your mouth like it's corn on the cob
Spit murder, purple date promos
And live forever like a Cliff Burton bass solo
Heavy Metal Kings, despicable me
Step out of first class Air France dipped in Supreme
Gucci chain, use medalion and the fist full of green
My angels of death dressed like pistols with beams
Rambo knives, my rhymes be dipped in fatigues
Tour the world with my goons, we're an invincible team
My hitters are mean, killers and guerillas that scheme
Killer machines ready to die while living the dream

[Hook x2]
