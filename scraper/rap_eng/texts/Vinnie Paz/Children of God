[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Never doubt your God, children singing songs about Jihad
Explosions that blow cars over buildings from afar
We the children of a bloodstained revolution
Gun bang, forever shoot and run fam, get your Uzi love thing
Retribution Timberland boots, leather gooses
In the undisclosed black bulletproof with the extra shooter
Bought a box of banana clips from these anarchists
Like Tim Osman commanding the ship on dialysis
More pain more gain, 9/11 was a war game
More enemies, more friends, more fame
Listen to propaganda cock the hammer
We can stop a man but how do you destroy an army that’s a phantom?
How do you kill a militia that’s invisible?
Mystical, peep what official pistols do, kid we invincible
How do you stop the unstoppable, unkillable?
The salvation of God, now sit back and listen to the song y’all

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
I heard children sing Allahu Akhbar in Turkey
One had a Russian AK, dirty Iverson jersey
I don’t know if it made me proud or if it disturbed me
I guess it’s not as bad as kids being fucked by the clergy
Kufi on, Glock cocked moving through the palace
A dead Kennedy in California Über Alles
I’ll drink a quart of virgin blood inside a Buddha chalice
I took the head off a Kennedy from the roof in Dallas
Yeah I wish that Ron Paul ran again
If not then I’mma have to take the lead like Jeff Hanneman
(Seasons of the abyss) y’all falling for the trap again
.38 leave your fucking body like a mannequin
Yeah if Billy blast at you I blast with him
We don’t live in a republic, it’s just fascism
The Louvre isn’t a museum, it’s a glass prison
Fuck a class system, listen to the song y’all
