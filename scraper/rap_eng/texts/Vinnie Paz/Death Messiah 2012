[Chorus - Johnny Cash:]
You can run on for a long time......
Sooner or later gonna cut you down

[Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz:]
Did protons and electrons create the earth?
Or did Allah meditate and create his birth?
Is everyday in this place a curse?
Or should I pray on my knees and embrace it's dirt?
I don't know if there's a reason I'm here
I feel the only thing that's driving me is reason and fear
And seeing death to me conceiveably near
So I don't give a fuck what you think bout me reachin for beer
I don't worry anymore about what my friends do
I have a more urgent matter to attend to
Is there something there bigger when I die and vanish?
That weaves everyone and everything into a canvas?
I'm not smart enough to think I have a resolution
I'll never be a man with mediocre constitution
My father told me that blood and power intoxicate
And that tearity is a product of his fathers hate

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz:]
I recognize the guilt and the sins of the father
And recognized what's built and what stems from the author
Understand man is not a machine
He needs a surface and a purpose and a reason for being
Either way I'm going to stick with my fam'
Regardless if that's a dream of a ridiculous man
And I'm becoming more indifferent every day
So naturally all of the feelings faded away
Some of the things I said I hated to say
But blame yourself mother fucker you made it this way
I don't think I would even if I was able to stay
I don't think you could I would sit to the angles and pray
But everybody's got to deal with theyself
If they cut another throat for the material wealth
If it's a problem are you man enough to deal with the hell?
Or are you destined for the darkness of concealing yourself?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Vinnie Paz:]
Trying to deal with the thirty-four years spent in prison
Not the physical because of existentialism
Backed myself into a previously lead deposition
When all I ever had to do is just repent and listen
Why can't everybody leave me alone
I'm the only one who'd really need to see that I've grown
You ain't smart enough to see what I know
Like to stab myself and let me fuckin bleed til' I go
But I'm too scared what would happen on the other side
Trying to fight the good fight how many of us died?
I don't know if I trust the people that hang with me
Is it god, or is it the big bang theory?
I know some really good people and they slang near me
But I don't think that comically they should hang really
Thirty-four years I don't have peace yet
And I ain't get out of the belly of the beast yet

[Chorus]
