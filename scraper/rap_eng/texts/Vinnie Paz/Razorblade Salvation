I know all the times were hard
I know that you've been feeling down
If you only knew how I'm feeling for you
If I could take your pain
I wish that I could wash it all away
If you only knew how I'm feeling

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Mommy, I'm sorry if my first letter made you cry
To be honest with you, I don't think that I want to die
Sometimes I feel like that I'm cancerous in other's lives
That's probably why I drink at night and sleep 'til four or five
It's kind of hard walkin' through life with my distorted eyes
When I was younger, I was stupid and I thought I'd thrive
I thought a lot about everything I said in the letter
And questioned whether or not if I was dead, you'd be better
You think my shorty would be happy if I never met her?
It's too late now, mommy, I could never forget her
Could never forget how she taught me to love
Cause my father and my grandmother is always above
It's glory above, you know that daddy taught me to thug
And every time we was with nanny she'd bombard me with hugs
Damn, I miss her, mommy, and it's hard to believe
That I'm grown and I don't understand it, why did they leave?

[Pre-Hook: Vinnie Paz]
It's better to die and sleep
The never waking sleep
Than linger on and dare to live
When the soul's life is gone

[Hook: Shara Worden]
You've been running around for so long
You've been hurting yourself too much
You keep messing around with darkness
You're the one who's losing
You've been running around for so long
You've been hurting yourself too much
You keep messing around with darkness
You're the one who's losing

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Mommy, I think that I'mma try to stick around a while
I got a niece, and my nephews, they need me 'round a while
I think they need me cause they hittin' that age
And they ain't tryin' to speak to Lenny cause they spittin' they rage
Yeah, and mommy, speakin' to Lenny, I think my brother need me
And we Italian, so you know my mother love to feed me
And it's the little things you do for me that make it worth it
Like when I play a joint that we did and you say it's perfect
And when Jake got knocked, you knew that I was hurt
You told me put all of my heart in the song, and it worked
I promised him that I'd be there when he got out the bing
You ain't raise me to be a liar, ma, that's not my thing
I told him that I'd hold him down the whole time that he gone
They kept him locked inside a cage, but that's cool, cause he's strong
So mommy, keep that first letter I wrote you on the low
I think I wanna stay alive and see if I can grow

[Hook: Shara Worden]
You've been running around for so long
You've been hurting yourself too much
You keep messing around with darkness
You're the one who's losing
You've been running around for so long
You've been hurting yourself too much
You keep messing around with darkness
You're the one who's losing

[Interlude: Movie sample]
"You have power and money, but you are mortal
You know you cannot escape death
But immortality can be obtained
The legend is always the same
If others have succeeded in conquering death
Why must we accept it?
I know where the immortals live
And how to obtain their secret
We too must become wise men
The elements of chemistry are many, but finite
So are the techniques of enlightenment"

[Bridge: Shara Worden]
I know all the times were hard
I know that you've been feeling down
If you only knew how I'm feeling for you
If I could take your pain
I wish that I could wash it all away
If you only knew how I'm feeling
