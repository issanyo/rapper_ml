[Verse 1 : Price Tag]
HS87 winning, if you ain’t with it go to Hades
I’m sicker than a snot nose baby with the rabies
I went from holding those rockets, to hawkin like the McGrady
Not a florist, but I have you pushing daisies if you play me
Yeah you test me and you die die, you niggas faker than five lies
That’s your girl, I killed her cat, you better pray it got nine lives
I’m head first like skydive, with the best step up, nigga, why try?
We got more colors then tie die, with the future nigga, no sci-fi
Got two things on me, feeling like Rambo
Pocket full of money and a whole lot of ammo
She said boy, I speak Spanish, I said “como te amo?”
She said boy, you dress so nice, I said “that’s fero te gamo”
If it’s party time, you know I got that stank and I got that drink
Like a shot that ain’t all net I got that bank, I got that bank
And if you wear chain you probably get a rash
I take your girl and I hit her fast
You come to my hood, you Luke Walton, you won’t get a pass nigga

[Hook: K. Roosevelt]
And when you see it you won’t believe it
You know you need it

[Verse 2 : Oktane]
I know when I hit the stage your hands better be up
Because I’m only spitting crack, you niggas better re-up
And any argument the hardest clique still won’t be enough
So when you’re talking about the best nigga it better be us
What you gotta figure out, we’re the hardest niggas out
Got that crack that’s missing everywhere that y'all be talking bout
It’s them young niggas with new cars, I pulled up to that new crib
That’s HS87 making all the moves you wish you did
Nigga we on and gone stay on, and a bad girl we ain’t laid on
I could do this all day long, up and up you get valeted on
Your girl just like a payphone, if I’m in her slot she’ll stay on
I can kick it like Chun-Li, Ryu, nigga, Fei Long
All you can do is stand there and look like that nigga’s amazing
I mean, listen to him, he fit out in wordsand phrases that nigga crazy
Wait, back, back, I don’t know you, chill
Flow too sick and I rap too ill
You need that crack and when you go too still
If we ain’t on the spot I don’t know who will
Oktane

[Hook: K. Roosevelt]
And when you see it you won’t believe it
You know you need it

[Verse 3 : Hit-Boy]
We used to be number ten, now we’re permanently in
There ain’t no treatment for this shit, we’re terminatelly ill
Shit we mercilessly kill every fucking thing moving
Watch me prove it, I just do it, on my Nike shit I’m zoomin'
And I know they love me, cause Discog(raphy) star heavy
But I’m tired of the interviews already
Bout to drop the game like the ball heavy
Now these hater niggas bring up cause I’m ball heavy call Jerry
How the fuck they dropped an album, ain’t no fillers,
They must have a team full of contract killers
Nah I’m realer, new thriller, MJ, these bitches quicker than the dominos deliver
Go ahead read through my scripters
Cause this real shit, I wreck shit, all quoteables, no flex shit
Y'all supposed to know, I blessed it, and it’s number one, no question
Like A.I. I answer, crossed over, got my advancer
I’m the newest member of Sam’s club, meaning I getting get no tax cut
Taking bitches to school when your papers due by
I’m just out by the pool spending changes Dubai
Like the fucking bull’s eye I am aiming at you, niggas
And it ain’t no competition, getting vain with my addictions

[Outro: K. Roosevelt]
