[Intro : Sway]
(Who's first to rock ? Audio Push is in here)


[Beat 1 : Price]
Price to the uh, uh
Back in my younger days I used to sport a rag
From the place where it ain't no dads and mama car ain't got no tags
Yeah

(Take you time with it take you time)
(The beat is heavy) Yeah (The beat is heavy)
Can it go louder in my headphone ? That's what I need
(That's what you needs ? It's Price)

Uh look uh
Back in my younger days I used to sport a rag
From the place where it ain't no dads and mamma car ain't got tags
But we still G'd up from the feet up
Youngins rollin' their weed up
Marks got beat up for throwin' the wrong street up
The Inland Empire where the world where the place
Where niggas from LA move cause they think that it's safe
But it ain't
It's case out there, it's pain and rainy days out there
They pay out there
Be careful what you say cause I was raised out there
This all I have, this all got all I know
When niggas put' on a show just to impress my hoe
And you gotta be careful who you let call you bro
Cause the same night that yall was eatin', we will have it you throat
But them type of things happen everywhere that you go
Niggas be plottin' and shit, apple be rockin' this shit
They reminiscin', contemplating, snitchin' and shit
They want your riches prolly cause they bitches boppin' this shit
But you know how we get down
I'm off the top like Sway's cap
Stay strap, nigga since way back
Fuck that talking, bitch I'm known  keep it [?] trick
On that coffee shit no off the shit
No option bitch I'm poppin' ho, niggas keep it poppin' though
Price easy no lockin' no, niggas ain't ready for the lockin' no
Evil Side 'till I die hoe Rialto Street ya know it's me
Pop this shit ya know the...


[Beat 2 : Oktane]
Look I say
It's knock knock bang bang get your beat killed
Til' everybody stop and just admit that he's real
He being me and I'm probably just fussin'
Cause I always have discussion with these wodies and they cousins
They say Oktane he be bussin'
They be hatin' and they be cussin'
Saying words I can't discuss because
I got lil cousins that be listenin and be stuck to me
And they really look up to me
So all your rappers luckily just know that you can't fluff with me
Your girl wanne be cuffin' me that's just how it work
Gave me the beat
I got on it boy now that beat is murked
I'm breaking hearts and you know that I'm leaving heads hurt
Who would've thought that these two young niggas made "Teach me how to jerk"


[Beat 3 : Price]
Hit-Boy is the best producer in the world by the way
Look uh
Real nigga came up from where they [?] crips
Ain't no reading my nigga just putting money on books
Freestylin' off the brain shit, same shit
Proabably take your main bitch, your main flip
I ain't never been a mark, I ain't never been a bitch
I never told on nobody I ain't never been a snitch
Real nigga from the Toe, always put down for the streets
Ain't nothing to the beef when it come we slayin' heat
I play no games I say no names I spread them thangs
Don't say no name I come through and I do my thang
They... yo uh
