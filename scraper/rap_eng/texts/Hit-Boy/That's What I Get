[Verse 1]
I met this bitch in LA shopping on Melrose
She had designer clothes on and some French tip toes
She was slim up in the waist and drove a pink Mustang
But all she wanted me to do was buy her weed all day
I met this bitch in NY she was oh so fly
Front row at fashion week was her favorite pastime
All she talked about was dressin Express and her favorite lines
But little did I know she had a million other guys
Then this bitch out in the A with a big ol ghetto booty
Always wanted to do me
Kept it wet like a jacuzzi
Had to switch to her hips, carried herself like a lady
Then the homies finally told me she a stripper and she crazy
Now It's LA, NY, Atlanta kind of bitches
That love stripping and clubbing, and tanning kind of bitches
It don't matter where they from or if they shape is different
They all got a quality that just comes up missing

[Chorus] x2
That's what I get for falling in love with bad bitches
That's what I get for falling in love with bad bitches
That's what I get for falling in love with bad bitches
No matter how bad she is, it's a bad ending

(Can't trust you)
Can't trust a big butt and a smile
But fuck it write your number down

[Verse 2]
Met this bitch in the IE used to work at the mills
Part time, went to college, Cal State in the hills
Bitch would claim she always studying so we would just be texting
Til I seen her in the club sipping drink in Game section
Met this bitch in DC on paper she travel weekly
Always listen to Lauryn Hill and Dilla on the CD
Said she don't know nobody and that she just a fan
Then I seen her backstage with the credentials I had
I met this bitch out in Miami crazy body she be tannin
She party with the best of em and drink what she was handed
And you know how it go I thought she was the best
Til I seen her court side three seats to the left
It go IE, DC, Miami kind of bitches
That watch Love and Hip Hop and Ballin kind of bitches
It don't matter where they from or if they shape is different
They all got a quality that just comes up missing

[Chorus] x2
That's what I get for falling in love with bad bitches
That's what I get for falling in love with bad bitches
That's what I get for falling in love with bad bitches
No matter how bad she is, it's a bad ending

(Can't trust you)
Can't trust a big butt and a smile
But fuck it write your number down
