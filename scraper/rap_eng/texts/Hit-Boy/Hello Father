[Verse 1]
Hello father, it's your daughter
Need your wisdom, drinking water
Need your wisdom, understanding
Can't live without your love, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Working hard tryna make me things right (working so hard)
I'm so glad I'm living in your light (oh, I am)
And I can't make it without you (I can't)
No, no, no (no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)

[Verse 2]
It's me again, it's your daughter
Yes, I'm knocking, need your blessing
Need your blessing
Can't be stressing over silly things, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Working hard tryna make me things right (working so hard)
I'm so glad I'm living in your light (oh, I am)
And I can't make it without you (I can't)
No, no, no (no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)

[Bridge]
This world is a tricky place (yes, it is)
He would tell you you can, yes indeed (he would tell you you would dear)
All the mistakes are made (and he say you can't be forgiven)
But we gotta make our minds up, yes indeed

[Chorus]
Working hard tryna make me things right (working so hard)
I'm so glad I'm living in your light (oh, I am)
And I can't make it without you (I can't)
No, no, no (no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)

[Outro]
I don't know
Hello father, thank you so much
I'm so grateful, for all your love
I'm so grateful for your love, it's enough God
I need you, only you, Lord, yeah, yeah
I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you, I need you
Everything here, I am blessed and highly favored
Because of all your love
Jesus is the reason, yeah
