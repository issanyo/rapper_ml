[Intro]
Yeah, just when you thought it was over
When you thought it was over... look

[Verse]
I tap into the highest frequencies at my lowest
Back at it, I'm more wise, I'm more focused
Can't think of a single artist I can't go with
Toe-to-toe with... look
Everybody got two cents to pitch in
At this point I'm worth what half a million?
A discount for the verse like two-fifty
Count it up if I miss count, start from the beginning
One of one like [?]
Two words to describe me and stand up
But I ain't no comedian, no jokes
All smoke for whoever want smoke
I done been through much worse
Learned to live with pain, roommates with the hurt
Tried to done me off, too late, didn't work
Hustle hard from the first to the first till they place me in first
And you know how I come with the H.B. beats
Brought it to Atlanta like it's [?]
No KC, everyday we cheat
Blow it all, get it back then repeat
He said he don't fuck with Quentin Miller, he sleep
If he flock behind someone else, he sheep
Disses on the sneak, trust we peep
They don't wanna see us eat, so we feast
Money [?] that I generate monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, minutely
Secondly (hahaha) not second though
You thought it was over
