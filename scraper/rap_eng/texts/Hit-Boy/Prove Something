[Intro]
24hrs, and you know it's Hit-Boy
Twenty a boss
Come to my city and see how I'm living
Wear those Celine frames I get ya

[Chorus]
Oh you popping, you in LA now
I got money, so you ready now
Feel like Rocko, going steady now
She said let's make it fast, my dude coming
I fuck her hard like I want prove something
I spend it all and I won't lose nothing
I get that mouth and hit the cruise button
That nigga he a lame, he won't do nothing
I fuck her hard like I want prove something
That nigga he a lame, he won't do nothing
I fuck her hard like I want prove something
That nigga he a lame, he won't do nothing

[Verse 1]
She said I don't do no molly
But I'll roll your marjuana
You get this pussy you gon' dub me
She said, "Twenty, hit it doggy
I call, I call, I call, I call
But Twenty you ignored me
You too fly for me, don't give me nothing you promised me
You don't talk to me, you really just wanna fuck on me
You don't keep it real, you always wanna embarrass me"
Please don't call my phone until you wanna cherish me
Bitch you a bird I just say your name is parakeet
Bitch this is Gucci ain't no way that you comparing me

[Chorus]
Oh you popping, you in LA now
I got money, so you ready now
Feel like Rocko, going steady now
She said let's make it fast, my dude coming
I fuck her hard like I want prove something
I spend it all and I won't lose nothing
I get that mouth and hit the cruise button
That nigga he a lame, he won't do nothing
I fuck her hard like I want prove something
That nigga he a lame, he won't do nothing
I fuck her hard like I want prove something
That nigga he a lame, he won't do nothing

[Verse 2]
She said, "Twenty, you ain't acting right
Come eat this pussy from the back tonight"
We was swagging crazy we was by the view
You would probably die if your nigga knew
Bitch, I'm head to toe in Gucci like a mannequin
If you cheat on me, lil bitch, I'm not your man again
We gon' fight and we make up and make a porn again
"There go Twenty he pull up and that new foreign again"
Once you try me ain't no way that I can care again
All these carrots on my wrist are vegetarian
All these diamonds on my neck look like the fair again
I put you on to YSL that's why you wearing them

[Chorus]
Oh you popping, you in LA now
I got money, so you ready now
Feel like Rocko, going steady now
She said let's make it fast, my dude coming
I fuck her hard like I want prove something
I spend it all and I won't lose nothing
I get that mouth and hit the cruise button
That nigga he a lame, he won't do nothing
I fuck her hard like I want prove something
That nigga he a lame, he won't do nothing
I fuck her hard like I want prove something
That nigga he a lame, he won't do nothing
