It's just the family affair
Time to make the living room feel like Madison Square
And if you made, you a square
Christmas in Cali, it's still family in here

Time to make the living room feel like Madison Square
And if you made, you a square
Christmas in Cali nigga


[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
(Say what you doin' Hit)
Nothin' I'm just neosporinâ€™d up I'm in the cut this year
I been workin' way too much this year
Home cookin' it ain't enough this year
Need that, where my [?] at, the collard greens at
Sweet potatoes with the cheese mac
God givin'
They askin' me for the last plate, I'll eat it
But I promessed my mama I'll do the dishes
Long as she give everything I asked for on my wish list

[Verse 2: N.No]
Look
It's only right I leave the kids with this quick gift
For all the years that I ain't get shit
It's only right I leave the kids with this quick gift
For all the years that I ain't get shit
As long as you got life and healt
Who gives a fuck about the white or wealth
This could be anything just be yourself
But make sure your family fine
Cause them youngins is flockin' around christmas time

[Verse 3: Kent Money]
Where the killers do be clappin'
Gettin' snatched,  cause truly happened
We just happy that we made it this far
When I was young I threw my dreams up in the air

That's why I can't wait to see her face this christmas

[Bridge: BMac The Queen]
Just another, Christmas in California hey
Them youngins know it ain't okay
Prayed everyday I even said my grace
I made a change now I'm on my way

[Verse 4: BMac The Queen]
I remember cryin' like Santa didn't remember me
Mama gone she puttin' work, daddy sippin' Henessy
I know I been good, I been good
I promess, I promess
Niggas from my hood did the opposite, sharp as piranhas
I wanna get out, but not by any means
I'mma make it the music yeah that was my only dream
And if I ever see Mister Claws, I'mma tell him that he did me wrong
Pullin' off in a shiny car, we off the boulevard then we on

[Verse 5 : Turtle]
Pockin' hoes and a presence
[?] I swear to God we gon' get it
[?] know I was a givin' my uncled mixed it with Henny
Santa Claus was cold he left my cuz in the pen
And fuck a [?] list, if we don't get what we want
Then we gon' go against them rings like Scottie Pippen
I swear it never rains in the Toe
Merry Christmas signed Turtle No, Joke

[Verse 6: B.Carr]
It's a celebration for all my wishes
Told my mama she finna have a christmas
Where she get everything desired plus what I insisted
For my nephews and my older sisters, ball out
Ain't no more limits to give, it's finna get it all now
When you broke, you tryin' hard not to crack a smile
Now that shit lookin' up it feels better, gettin' high now
Callin' my mama sayin' hi now

[Verse 7: Oktane]
Before I wanted all the money and all the fame
I wanted the Sega Genesis with all the games
I had the Grant Hills on, running playing cops and robbers
Back when getting faded only dealt with gloves of Sock'em Boppers
That's was back before Bape, one day on christmas break
I got the white and red 30's back in 98
That's was back before Bape, one day on christmas break
I got the white and red 30's back in 98

[Verse 8: Price]
See where I'm from we wasn't waitin' enough for Mister Claws
We was in the hood waitin' on mama chips to fall
So we could hit the mall
Granny in the kitchen cookin' gumbo, dirty rice empty
Replace my dirty nikes with air force pearly white
My mama said her check ain't come but stay patient
Then went to the garage and pull out the Playstation
Marvin Gaye playin', kids in the living room
[?] while I'm smokin' with my cousins
This the season to be lovin'
Price
