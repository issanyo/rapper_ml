[Intro]
Prelude
An action or event serving as introduction to something bigger
So this is the calm before the storm...
We present to you, the Resolution...

[Verse]
I'm revolution minded
So this is perfect timing
For me to present a resolution
With lines defining
I draw it in the sand
I'm clay within His hands
The Master's masterpiece
Restoring light into the land
Faith ain't meant to make sense
And Now I understand!
I'm just a servant taking orders from The master plan
Captain, lieutenant
An independent dependent
My independence became a dependence on every sentence
So I admit it!
We ain't finished!
Never ashamed to confess the name
He's all in it!
JESUS
And This is Gods business!
Kingdom expanding
While Never minding the opposition
I can't lose
What's supposed to be my competition?
We the living dead
Now that's a real life contradiction!
Starbursting
Light Shining
We made perfect
Lighten Up the dark
The Men in Black They stay lurking!
Shades off
Roof gone!
With no illusions we illuminate the Truth Holmes!
No Sherlock
Its Unheard of
Bakah Barackas
A-Team
Flows Murdock
Yeah Word Up!
Had to get my Word Up
Life is like a jungle but you can't stay curled up!
Sight back to the blind
Gotta Read between the lines
Snakes lay in that grass
But your life is in that Vine
Hold up!
Get ya Eyes open!
See what's happening
They want you like a paralyzed mime
No action!
Silenced!
No captions
Cause wit no vision you could never enact this!
Purpose fuels passion so get up off that mattress
Calling for that action it's drastic
So appointed
Wasn't born to take us backwards
So anointed
Solution minded
Fair warning
So this to All us!
Put ya R's up!
We on display
And They've been waitin on all of us!
Droughts over
I'm smelling reign
Clears skies
Illuminating everything!
No pain
Life is on a Bench press
Get ya bars up
Time to Elevate ya Reflex
Now that's a moment of clarity get ya Windex
God over everything
Time to hit that Reset!
Gone!
