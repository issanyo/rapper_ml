Hook/Intro
Ain't nobody like my baby
Ain't nobody like my baby
I wanna be all up in your space
All up in your face, all up in your place
You want me all up in your space
All up in your face
Oh babe

Whisper in my ear, like baby where we goin
Trippin in montigo, straight to costa rica
Then hit up peru, like ooh girl look at you
You just wanna have fun
That don't mean that you the one yeah

Pre-chorus
No I don't care for nothing
But you got me all up in my thoughts
Making your way to my heart

There's something bout you always want you around me, no matter the cost
I know that your love won't be bought
Just let me show you that

Listen up baby girl I just wanna have fun
Drop it down low come on let me give you some
