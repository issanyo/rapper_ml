My momma raised me up in the era when
Papa was gone
He was servin' coke and heroin
Writin' raps, you woulda thought I had help
But niggas frontin'
Fuck it, I'll just keep these beats for myself
You see, it's broke nigga hatin'
That's the Internet shit, talkin' on the low
And it's rich nigga hatin'
That's don't let him in, that nigga might blow
All I want's some money, some hoes, and champagne
A boat, some smoke, fur coats
Slick Rick chains and a damn plane
Gotta put on for my niggas
Whippin' without the pain
So I'm spending everything
Just to look good with my gang
New chains
So I guess we the new slaves
New chains bitch

You see it's Beamers
And it's Honda, love
Only one'll get the fucked
The other, not as much
You see, it's Ninas and it's Monicas
Both crazy 'bout the dick, so they swallow nuts
Lobster, mac and cheese, and fire weed
That's the combination
It's the fucking House of Hit
That hailing Satan congregation
Hallelujah, halleluhjah
We just brought in three more cases
KKKin' bottles of dark
Thought the whole party was racist
I'm workin' hard for a check
Just to put it on my neck
A nigga with a new chain
Now that's that James Somersett
Now that's that James Somersett, Now that's that James Somersett
A nigga with a new chain
Now that's that James Somersett
But fuck it
I know you've seen Baby on TV
Cause I've seen him too
Watchin' 'em too
Wishin' that was me and my crew
Real life ghetto kings, my stuntin' idols
I understood what that message was
Cash Money was them fly niggas
I wanted everything except the love
Soon as my cake up, I'm going straight up to Jacob
And I'mma spend it all
Blowin' everything that I was supposed to save up
Now Jesus had skin to bronze
So I pay my tithe that was owed
And used the rest of my green
To turn my Jesus into gold
I turn my Jesus into gold, I turn my Jesus into gold
So either way we're still slavin'
Just hanging from a different rope
This just my song of honesty
Nigga, fuck your philosophy
Gotta ball out by any means
Even if it's at the swap meet
You know where Ben Baller be
We know them hoes wanna see, we know them hoes wanna see
Nigga, we'll get fresh before we eat
So no, don't sweat the technique
I'm tryin' shine like Eric B
I'm tryin' floss like Rakim
So I'm spending everything from my deal, bitch
